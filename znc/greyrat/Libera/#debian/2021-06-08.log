[02:14:47] <useretail> hey, what's the release date for bullseye?
[02:15:47] <nvs> !wwbr
[02:15:47] <dpkg> Now Debian "Bullseye" is the current testing branch as of 2019-07-06 and it will be released "when it's ready."
[02:15:58] <useretail> i'm on buster, can i safely dist-upgrade right now? 
[02:16:00] <amacater> When it's ready - it's being discussed now. There's likely to be an RC2 release iminently, then probably an RC3 then release. Best guess: Late July
[02:16:18] * nvs holds amacater to it!
[02:16:22] <amacater> You can: I've just done so tonight on a minimal machine
[02:17:20] <amacater> Bullseye is pretty much frozen solid so changes will be minimal but there may well be final changes and small bugs that crop up which will need to be fixed.
[02:17:31] *** Joins: stateless (~Thunderbi@2603:9000:7101:5e11:0:946e:fb6:cd71)
[02:18:00] <amacater> If you really want to try it now - probably best to try this on a spare machine / VM rather than your only
[02:18:04] <amacater> priceless laptop.
[02:18:05] <jhutchins> amacater: Late freeze is also the time they let the really big, bad bugs loose and whack away at them.
[02:18:40] <amacater> Agreed but most of the really big bad bugs have already been flattened :)
[02:18:59] <jhutchins> It's possibly better to set up a dual-boot so you're testing it on the actual hardware you will use.
[02:19:37] <amacater> If you do want to do this: use apt-get in a few stages. Change /etc/apt/sources.list to reference bullseye rather than buster
[02:20:03] <jhutchins> amacater: Sometimes they back out the changes that broke things so that they can make progress on other problems, then near the end of the cycle they roll them back out and start tweaking.

[02:20:20] <amacater> apt-get update. Stop, check - there will be a couple of errors because a couple of the sources aren't there for bullseye yet
[02:20:29] *** Quits: amahl (~amahl@dsl-jklbng12-54fbca-64.dhcp.inet.fi) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[02:20:35] <jhutchins> Of course, it depends on whether your purpose is to get work done or to play with the software.
[02:20:52] <amacater> apt-get upgrade - that gives you an update of the packages that will upgrade cleanly.
[02:21:09] <amacater> apt-get autoremove - remove any so far that are unneeded from buster
[02:21:13] <useretail> ok, i guess i can wait two months
[02:21:17] <amacater> apt-get dist-upgrade - final update
[02:21:24] <amacater> apt-get autoremove again
[02:21:49] <useretail> autoremove sucks, right now it shows probably all packages i have
[02:22:11] *** Quits: greycat (~greg@209.142.155.49) (Quit: Bye)
[02:22:26] <amacater> So that's why you use apt-get not apt for this particular process - slightly different resolvers
[02:23:03] <PMT> That information surprises me; I assumed they shared that.
[02:23:18] <amacater> Oh, and of course - make sure you're absolutely up to date on buster before you start and remove/comment out any non-Debian repositories
[02:23:36] <useretail> that's something new
[02:23:56] <amacater> They share the backend files but play subtly differently on how fiercely they work, I think ... but I could be very wrong.
[02:24:07] <useretail> so what should i use regularly: apt or apt-get?
[02:24:28] <amacater> apt-get has always been recommended for this particular purpose of upgrading from major release to major release in the past.
[02:24:38] *** Quits: cliluw (~cliluw@47.147.80.149) (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
[02:24:57] <PMT> Shouldn't apt print a warning if you try to use it for that, then?
[02:25:01] <amacater> apt / apt-get either will do for normal purposes. I grew up with apt-get 
[02:25:02] <jmcnaught> Always refer to the upgrade instructions in the release notes before upgrading, they will say which to use.
[02:25:14] <amacater> Absolutely :D

[02:26:10] <jhutchins> I know this falls on deaf ears, but >BACKUPS<.
[02:26:42] <PMT> Just because you often feel like Cassandra doesn't mean you should stop warning people.
[02:27:13] <useretail> jmcnaught, how to backup debian? which folders? /home? /etc?
[02:27:13] <amacater> Or be prepared to try it first on a VM that you create for the purpose. There are a LOT of changes in three years or so.
[02:27:53] *** Quits: ddsys (~ddsys@user/ddsys) (Quit: Leaving)
[02:28:08] <amacater> Oh, and if you've got testing in your /etc/apt/sources.list - change it to bullseye now explicitly unless you want to see breakage just at the point of release as bookworm becomes testing ...
[02:28:12] *** Joins: ddsys (~ddsys@user/ddsys)

[02:29:26] <jhutchins> useretail: In this case, I would suggest that you boot to a live iso and just image the whole disk.  That way the restore is vastly simplified.
[02:29:29] <amacater> That's one good use of codenames
[02:31:49] <jhutchins> useretail: Clonezilla is also a good way to go.
[02:31:55] <jhutchins> !clonezilla
[02:31:55] <dpkg> Clonezilla Live is a live CD based on Debian, providing disk/partition cloning functionality similar to Symantec Ghost.  Basically a front-end to <partimage>, <partclone>, <ntfsclone>, sfdisk and others.  http://www.clonezilla.org/  See also <based on Debian>.

[02:34:19] <useretail> jhutchins, cloning is great, but i just want to preserve the settings and a list of installed apps, it would be much faster and safer to re-install everything from scratch
[02:34:35] <useretail> *imo

[06:31:06] <cdhowie> you'd think but some things are deceptively tricky to backport
[06:31:18] <cdhowie> irssi can't be backported from sid to stable easily
[06:32:45] <cdhowie> i tried because the version in sid has a fix for a config parsing issue that's in buster; an irssi-generated config file won't parse
[06:32:52] <cdhowie> so here we are in weechat now
[06:33:25] <sney> how did it get stuck? dependencies seem to be satisfied, was there an incompatible patch or some compiler issue instead?
[06:34:19] <cdhowie> it needs a newer debhelper or whatever to build
[06:34:28] <cdhowie> upgrading that tries to upgrade a ton of stuff like libc
[06:34:55] <somiaj> no, debhelper is already in backports, almost everything depends on a newer compact level, just install debhelper from backports
[06:35:44] <sney> ,v debhelper
[06:35:46] <judd> Package: debhelper on amd64 -- jessie: 9.20150101+deb8u2; jessie-security: 9.20150101+deb8u2; stretch: 10.2.5; stretch-backports: 12.1.1~bpo9+1; buster: 12.1.1; buster-backports: 13.3.3~bpo10+1; bullseye: 13.3.4; sid: 13.3.4
[06:36:20] <cdhowie> ah, i didn't try using bpo to build.  regardless, weechat seems better maintained anyway so.
[06:37:29] <somiaj> the reason here is it was impractical to keep people holding teh compact level of packages back so they could be backported, easier to just provide debhelper in backports, so almost all backports need that to build, that way matainers can take advantage of the newest compact level
[06:37:50] <sney> (and someday even the bot will know about it)
[06:38:03] <cdhowie> yeah that makes sense
[06:38:34] <somiaj> though the backport instructions should also be updated to install debhelper from backports in the instructions, just since most things under active upgrades will need it
[06:38:50] <PMT> cdhowie: which bug in irssi?
[06:40:11] <cdhowie> PMT: https://github.com/irssi/irssi/issues/1062 -- i don't know if this is the same issue i'm running into.  the error messages are identical but the config file doesn't have the blank line as indicated in the issue tracker.
[06:40:25] <cdhowie> it's a config file created by /save and i haven't edited it by hand
[06:40:37] * PMT is currently running a version of irssi that he cherrypicked a patch for an issue where /reload mangled certain config data.
[06:41:47] <cdhowie> but i've had other minor grips with irssi that mostly seem to be resolved with weechat so i guess this was the push i needed to try something different
[06:41:51] <cdhowie> gripes*

[07:54:27] <somiaj> also note that network-online can slow down boot times signiffinitally if you have to actually wait until the network is fully up and online (most services don't need this but some do)

[08:06:55] <cdhowie> blluis: i suspect that everything is _actually_ working, because you have Type=forking
[08:07:10] <blluis> In fact the service starts because there are text from service in the log
[08:07:31] <blluis> Maybe I should ask to the program devs why the service quits
[08:07:43] <cdhowie> it may not be quitting
[08:07:54] <cdhowie> it's common to daemonize by forking and then letting the parent process terminate
[08:08:02] <blluis> Main PID: 733 (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
[08:08:19] <cdhowie> right so 733 was the parent, it forked, then it died and the child should still be running
[08:08:27] <cdhowie> check "ps ax" and see if the child is still running
[08:09:12] <cdhowie> you told systemd Type=forking so it's expecting the parent to quit, which i believe is why it doesn't report that the unit failed to start.  from systemd's perspective everything is fine, i think.
[08:09:54] <cdhowie> from the docs on Type=forking: "The child continues to run as the main service process, and the service manager will consider the unit started when the parent process exits."
[08:10:52] <blluis> I remove the log and reboot to check if a new log is created
[08:11:08] <cdhowie> you shouldn't have to do that.  just check if the child is running with ps

[08:12:46] <cdhowie> and with Type=simple, systemd can monitor the process and will report that it's alive and tell you the PID
[08:13:20] <cdhowie> to clarify, both should work, but removing -d and changing forking->simple should give you a better view into the service's status

[08:19:36] <cdhowie> i suspect it was still running before but systemd has no way to tell when Type=forking
[08:19:50] <blluis> In every example I found on the net they say that DON'T CHANGE TYPE to simple
[08:20:21] *** Joins: bloodninja (~bloodninj@user/bloodninja)
[08:20:30] <cdhowie> they are right, but ONLY when you are using -d
[08:20:48] <cdhowie> i have no idea why they'd prefer daemonize with type=forking
[08:20:54] <cdhowie> foreground with type=simple seems so much more robust to me
[08:21:47] <cdhowie> if you use type=simple with -d then when the parent quits systemd thinks the service crashed and tries to restart it (if you told it to)
[08:21:49] <blluis> neither do I, Im a newbie in linux, using from debian 7 but mostly to develop and use desktop apps
[08:22:20] <blluis> well, do I leave without the daemon flag and in simple or change something?
[08:22:37] <cdhowie> if you use type=forking without -d then systemd thinks that the service is still starting because it expects the parent to terminate and it doesn't
[08:22:47] <cdhowie> i'd leave type=simple and no -d
[08:23:01] <blluis> Ok, I will leave as you suggest
[08:23:18] <cdhowie> this will let you "systemctl stop" it too.  i'm not sure that it can stop it with type=forking unless you supply a pidfile.
[08:23:31] <cdhowie> otherwise it doesn't know what to kill
[08:25:11] <cdhowie> people see a "daemonize" flag and think "oh i want this to be a service so i must want that."  in reality it depends heavily on your init system and how you have it configured.

[08:26:29] <blluis> I use to do with init.d, Im new to systemd and I take this example from the debian site, but instead of instaling the oficial package I have to install manually an alternative version because I have problems with my dual nic headless server
[08:27:09] <blluis> this version works well with IP6 and the official not
[08:27:44] *** Quits: brachamh (~brachamh@user/brachamh) (Remote host closed the connection)
[08:27:57] <cdhowie> IMO it's better to have the service foreground with Type=simple.  i don't really see an advantage to making it go in the background with Type=forking and needing a pidfile.  just seems like pointless complexity, but maybe there is a reason i'm not aware of.
[08:28:08] *** Joins: brachamh (~brachamh@user/brachamh)
[08:28:56] <somiaj> cdhowie: Something like apache that already has its own tools to query/monintor the service might be a reason, but this is still an artifact from not having systemd to handel those types of things
[08:29:37] <cdhowie> right that's kind of what i figured
[08:29:43] <somiaj> I was just looking at their .service file as an example, and it is mostly a wrapper for apachectl
[08:29:51] <blluis> I have a lot to learn of systemd, I use to make my scripts/programs with init.d
[08:30:21] <blluis> In fact this service file is installed with apt install qbittorrent-nox
[08:30:21] <somiaj> but it does take away the need to create such tools and to avoid -d flags which often do nothing more than just fork the process with nohup
[08:30:55] <cdhowie> yeah
[08:31:12] <cdhowie> i don't know why anyone would use Type=forking except in situations where the service _can't_ be run in the foreground

[08:36:29] <PMT> You know, all I wanted to do was reproduce a bug in a VM today. But it seems like it's full of complications and software bugs. (This message brought to you by #942579)
[08:36:30] <judd> Bug https://bugs.debian.org/942579 in qemu-utils (open): «qemu-utils: nbd disconnect/timout/system hang when writing to image mounted with qemu-nbd»; severity: normal; opened: 2019-10-18; last modified: 2019-11-20.
[08:38:08] <cdhowie> PMT: i used nbd to attach a device over the network and had the system hang after a few days.  i asked in #btrfs since it was one of multiple btrfs devices in a filesystem and was told that the kernel nbd driver has multiple known deadlock bugs.
[08:38:17] <cdhowie> PMT: so it's likely that, not qemu-utils itself
[08:38:55] <cdhowie> for now i just avoid anything nbd
[08:39:06] <PMT> cdhowie: my counterpoint to that would be someone reporting in the bug that ancient qemu-utils works without such problems?
[08:39:53] <PMT> Also, if you have an alternative suggestion for presenting a VHD and VDI as normal block devices, I'm all ears.
[08:40:08] <PMT> (And yes, I know about qemu-img convert, I was trying to avoid needing to do that.)
[08:40:10] <cdhowie> hard to say.  all i can tell you is that i suffered multiple such deadlocks and i wasn't using qemu-utils at all.
[08:40:28] <cdhowie> i was actually using the nbd client to use a disk over the network
[08:40:44] <PMT> I certainly believe it.

[08:42:02] <cdhowie> i doubt many people actually use it tbh
[08:42:11] <cdhowie> iscsi exists and is way more standard
[08:42:39] <PMT> I think I expect unused code in the kernel to also get ejected eventually.
[08:43:08] <cdhowie> yeah i dunno.  i'm just repeating what a btrfs developer told me.
[08:43:48] <cdhowie> nbd is way simpler than iscsi so i would prefer to use it but it seems to be problematic so
[08:44:17] <PMT> Sure, I'm not trying to suggest you didn't have legitimate deadlocks, I just don't know that the problems you had over the network are the same ones I'm having over purely local connectivity.
[08:45:12] <cdhowie> either way the kernel module is involved, it just uses the protocol between two local entities (kernel module and qemu-nbd) instead of between the kernel module and a TCP socket
[08:45:25] <cdhowie> which is why i suspect the kernel module.  it's what's in common in both scenarios.
[08:47:29] <PMT> Yes, but it working with ancient qemu-nbd and the same kernel suggests either the ancient qemu-nbd isn't tickling the kernel module wrong or it's a problem with qemu-nbd.
[08:47:52] <PMT> lord this is going to end with me trying to bisect ancient qemu
[08:48:57] <cdhowie> deadlock bugs tend to be tricky to reproduce.  probably something in newer qemu-nbd that is better at reproducing it.

[08:51:09] <cdhowie> though if qemu-nbd is causing a system-wide hang then the kernel module is absolutely at fault in some way.  a userland process shouldn't be able to do that.
[08:51:30] <PMT> The hung processes are trying to access the filesystem mounted via nbd.
[08:51:47] <cdhowie> oh hmm.  in my case it was a deadlock in the kernel itself, requiring a hard reboot.
[08:52:15] <PMT> In my case, this time, it might require a reboot, because I killed the hung nbd process, and it's been a zombie for 10 minutes now.
[08:53:07] <PMT> I suspect if I tried rmmod -f nbd, comedy would ensue.
[08:53:55] <cdhowie> for some definition of comedy
[08:54:09] <cdhowie> but yeah stuff like this is exactly why i stay away from nbd nowadays
[08:54:49] <cdhowie> i wonder how tricky it would be to write a userland iscsi implementation that can be backed by VHD/VDI
[08:54:58] <cdhowie> in fact i wonder if that already exists...
[08:55:21] <PMT> If I were doing it, I'd probably leverage qemu's image support.
[08:56:10] <cdhowie> you could actually do that -- run a linux qemu VM with the image attached, and export it over iscsi from the guest to the host 
[08:56:18] <cdhowie> kind of a hack but probably won't deadlock your kernel :)
[08:57:38] <cdhowie> anyway i doubt it would be _that_ complicated to write an iscsi daemon that can export VHD/VDI.  would be nice to add support to tgtd for example.
[08:58:35] <PMT> I'm not sure you understand my luck with software. :)
[08:58:56] <PMT> Anyway, I'll BRB, rebooting for reasons which may be obvious.

[15:51:44] <ratrace> zerowalker_w: not sure I understand what you're saying

[15:53:20] <ratrace> but with physically separate networks, that's another story, very much doable.
[15:53:28] <zerowalker_w> they are physically separate. the network i am setting it up with is say 192.168.1.0/24 and the place it's supposed to end up it is 192.168.1.5/24 (with it acting as a dhcp server)
[15:53:49] <ratrace> that's the same subnet

[17:13:07] <jamea77> hi all
[17:13:23] <jamea77> how to copy from dir1 to dir2 only files that not exist on dir2?
[17:14:40] <ratrace> jamea77: rsync with --ignore-existing?
[17:15:00] <ratrace> but in general, if you use rsync, it'll copy over only deltas and differences from source dir, if that suffices for your use case
[17:15:25] <emacspenguin> You could rm -rf dir2 (delte all the files in dir2) then cp -r dir1 (copy all files from dir1 to dir2)

[17:19:38] <jamea77> if file1 exist in both sides ignore? right? note file1 would be different in the content, but in filename is same...
[17:21:42] <ratrace> jamea77: with --ignore-existing, I think it checks by filename only. you can use -n and see if it'd overwrite anything. -i for itemized list of changes

[17:42:39] <jelly> you now have a /opt/payara5/glassfish/domains/swItsol2/config/config

[17:44:39] <jelly> and ONLY WHEN THE OUTPUT IS FINE you remove -n and run the command without -n to actually do the copying
[17:45:11] <jamea77> ok
[17:45:21] <jelly> in short, understand what the tool is doing, and verify it is only doing the thing you want it to do
[17:45:28] <jelly> not more, not less
[17:45:54] <jelly> this is why commands have a an option to only show what would have been done

[17:47:37] <jamea77> donem thanks
[17:48:44] <ratrace> and it's be very wise to make it a habit to inspect manpages when you're given a command, to try and understand what it does before you accidentally rmrf your entire rootfs because someone was clowning around.

[23:09:44] <jmcnaught> The release candidate is of the bullseye installer, not bullseye itself.
