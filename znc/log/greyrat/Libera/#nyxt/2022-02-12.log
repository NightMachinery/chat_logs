[14:45:14] <edgarvincent[m]> Dogzilla100: I have built (and run) it successfully on a Pinephone in the past, so I'm sure it's possible.
[14:50:38] <edgarvincent[m]> This FOSDEM talk about using Lisp to develop mobile-friendly Linux apps looks interesting: https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/mobile_graphical_lisp/

[17:11:29] <waleee[m]> edgar.vincent: when did Dogzilla100 ask that question? I'm testing matrix as a low-budget irc-bouncer, but I'm not convinced I see all messages
[17:15:40] <edgarvincent[m]> waleee: Thursday, at 21:23.
[17:16:02] <edgarvincent[m]> Matrix does skip some Libera messages, for some reason.
[17:17:18] <waleee[m]> I will consider it an improvement from not seeing messages at all while offline from irc
[17:30:39] <edgarvincent[m]> sure ^^
[17:30:40] <edgarvincent[m]> All in all, I find it very handy, and hardly ever use an IRC client.

[20:39:17] <lagash> I like my IRC client (Circe aka I'm an Emacs user here!), Matrix is... well, it's like all the other web clients. I know there are 3rd-party ones but I don't feel like downloading yet-another-program when I have my IRC bouncer and my Jabber client.
[20:42:05] <waleee> lagash: I'm using element (most common matrix-client) on my phone, at a computer I go for an irc-client since matrix can be a bit slugghish
[20:43:10] <waleee> s/slugghish/sluggish/
[20:54:41] <lagash> Sluggish is an understatement, ugh
[21:00:35] <ardon> You guys want to give https://github.com/alphapapa/ement.el a try

[21:10:27] <waleee> emacs and android doesn't sound like a match made in heaven
