[00:07:18] <Plazma> so when sovling systems of linear equations, i'm forgetting, but typically we have Ax-b where x is a vector of unknowns, and A and b are knowns.. but is there a way to solve it such that x and b are both unknowns?
[00:08:32] <riv> you can just pick any x and calculate b to find solutions for that
[00:08:57] <Plazma> hmm, that sounds vaguely familiar
[00:09:37] <Plazma> but for some reason my brain can't process that for some reason, especially if it's just any x

[01:09:40] <XCode> Plazma: it is about Hodge D conjecture.
[01:09:45] <Plazma> oh
[01:09:51] <Plazma> well congrats on getting published
[01:10:35] <XCode> Plazma: thanks in the first publication we had error but we fixed it.
[01:10:51] <XCode> Plazma: it is about Hodge D conjecture on product of elliptic curves.
[01:11:06] <Plazma> ahh cool
[01:11:48] <XCode> yeah I am currently trying to abstract general properties of our proof to more general varieties and begin writing my thesis and also begin working on something else in my thesis.
[01:11:57] <tolarz> XCode: yeah, i did school, bsc, msc all without breaks

[01:16:18] <Plazma> cool
[01:16:22] <XCode> Plazma: one of my friends does quantum cryptography in Oxford he talks to me about it all the time. It is very interesting.

[03:33:30] <isekaijin> You can do cool stuff like study the long-term future of the solar system. How come the solar system is stable (and seems to have been for at least hundreds of millions of years), even though its major bodies (the Sun and the planets) interact with each other gravitationally?
[03:34:12] <Guest59> of course these are simplifications of physical observations, but that's science
[03:34:35] <isekaijin> Already the 3-body problem is complicated and interesting.
[03:34:56] <mefistofeles> 2-body in QM :P
[03:36:57] <Guest59> i still don't understand "QM". People say PDEs and whatever can be applied in "quantum" mechanics, but to me they are just PDEs
[03:37:25] <Guest59> should probably just take the QM1 offered by the phys department and get it over with
[03:37:33] <Guest59> but those damn people use awful inner product notation
[03:37:44] <mefistofeles> dirac notation? Best notation ever
[03:38:14] <isekaijin> Are you going to not take a course on a topic that you find interesting simply because you disagree with the notational choices of the people who teach it?
[03:38:34] <Guest59>  no, i'm being facetious
[03:44:41] <biberao> isekaijin: im too stupid
[03:44:42] <biberao> .D
[03:47:19] <[itchyjunk]> i wanted to take an intro to GR and QM class
[03:47:47] <[itchyjunk]> it has a "modern physics" as a prereq. it was a class that mostly covered history of phy more than any actual phy and you couldn't skip it
[03:47:50] <[itchyjunk]> pretty lame
[03:49:55] <johnkeats6> doesn't make that much sense to pack intro gr and qm in the same class
[03:50:50] <[itchyjunk]> its a low level class though
[03:50:55] <[itchyjunk]> but not sure what it covered
[03:51:52] <Samian> I just did a full backpropr for a 5 hidden layers, 5 nodes per layer, neural net, all by pencil and paper and no calculator mwahaha I feel so elite
[03:51:54] <[itchyjunk]> oh they changed the requirement so you don't need the modern physics crap now
[03:51:55] <[itchyjunk]> so lame
[03:52:18] <[itchyjunk]> did you? i never really figured out the back prop partial derivatives myself
[03:52:24] <[itchyjunk]> i should do that too maybe..
[03:52:41] <Samian> and I checked my results against pytorch
[03:53:44] <ysftaha> So I have to prove the set of all sets does not exist given Russel's paradox ~(∃X)(X = {x | x ∉ x}) The set of all sets not containing themselves does not exist.
[03:53:47] <ysftaha> Do I start with contradiction? The set of all sets exists therefore the set of all sets not containing themselves is in the set of all sets?

[04:38:07] <ysftaha> Although I'm not sure how proofs make sense if the system is inconsistent
[04:39:00] <PlanckWalk> The general idea would be that if a set of all sets exists, then you can form the subset of it consisting of all sets that do nto contain themselves.
[04:39:41] <PlanckWalk> Since that's just a predicate that every element either satisfies or does not satisfy

[07:18:33] <greenbagels> woah, just saw the definition of cartesian products of sets in terms of functions from index sets to unions of the factors
[07:20:30] <somiaj> Just need something that mimics that |AxB| = |A|x|B|
[07:20:46] <somiaj> similar to A^B = { f: B->A }
[07:21:46] <somiaj> greenbagels: though you have to be careful with that definition, it is quite common to define functions in terms of cartesian products, so defining cartesian products in terms of functions can cause an undefined loop

[07:30:32] <greenbagels> it seems a lot of graduate level math starts off with much heavier set theory machinery than in undergrad
[07:30:54] <greenbagels> i think i can see why my undergrad profs were so hesitant to try to give a formal glimpse into things like measure theory
[07:31:27] <somiaj> depends, a lot can be done with a very nieve since of set theory just fine

[08:37:43] <Samian> jmorris  I actually just asked if there was a name for it because I'm sure someone has wondered this before
[08:38:04] <jmorris> Samian: it doesnt make sense
[08:38:06] <Samian> This is what i asked: Is there a word for different types of weight updating such as:  (1) computer gradient; update a single weight; compute the new forward pass output since one of the weights changed it will be different;  compute the new error; use the new error to compute the next neuron;  <-- I call this method per-neuron weight updating.  (2) update last layer; recompute the forward pass using the new weights for the last layer; compute the new error that
[08:38:06] <Samian>  uses the updated last layer;  update the second to last layer;  repeat <-- I call this per-layer updating;   (3). all weights of the neural net are updated using the same neural net state;  partially-updated neural nets where some layers or some neurons are updated while others aren't yet isn't done; <-- this is Pytorch's current method.
[08:38:20] <jmorris> you want to update the weights at once
[08:38:39] <jmorris> otherwise your convergence is suboptimal
[08:39:23] <jmorris> say using stochastic gradient descent
[08:39:28] <jmorris> it just makes no sense to do that

[08:44:59] <PlanckWalk> A billion 1-dimensional updates is nowhere near as safe or effective as 1 billion-dimensional update.
[08:45:27] <Samian> jmorris what do you mean by monotonically?

[08:48:52] <PlanckWalk> Even in 2D it is easy to find situations where the global gradient can't be reasonably approximated just by moving in individual partial dereivative direction

[08:53:07] <Samian> that's the anology. Anyway we're all in agreement. I was just telling Decker who yesterday expressed a different view from the one we hold
[08:54:52] <PlanckWalk> Well, we're minimizing error so we're trying to get to the lowest point in it.
[08:56:22] <PlanckWalk> If the canyon is really steep in the (1,1) direction and very shallow in the (1,-1) direction, then you can eventually approach the bottom by taking millions of *really tiny* axis-aligned steps.
[08:56:48] <PlanckWalk> Or you can take a few much larger steps straight to it.
[08:58:51] <PlanckWalk> Layer-at-a-time updates aren't axis-aligned, though.

[10:17:26] <Toxmi> Samian: As far as I know, exploding gradients (and conversely vanishing gradients), are for describing the case that your gradients in the back propagation are high such that the chain rule of these gradients in learning cause the network get unstable and effectively does not learn. In a MLP, you'll multiply chains of gradients and want them be in a sensible range (which determiens by Net
[10:17:28] <Toxmi> architecture and problem). learning rate is just a side contributing factor to unstabiility
[10:18:04] <qergle> these splits are due to servers getting software upgrades.

[10:26:54] <Toxmi> Samian: The precision problem might happen and that is bad, but generally you're optimizing on a non-convex unknown function  basically. To some extends it depends on the problem. Large numbers lead to big jumps and your optimization can not find a local minima approperiate for your problem. They call "learning" as the case you approach a (hopefullY) good local minima which result in good
[10:26:56] <Toxmi> performance (by some external measure). When thesae number get big increasingly the network basically jump from point to point and it doesn't learn anything i.e. it doesn't gonna approach a hpefully good local minima...so it doesn't learn effectively.

[11:03:59] <Takwah> x starts at 1
[11:05:32] <Takwah> and everytime a roll is over or in a variation over or equal to x. x will increase by 1. x is the target value at which the probability distribution is valid. sorry for my no math terms.

[11:06:46] <int-e> So the probability of success decreases as x increases... making it a coupon collection scenario.
[11:07:48] <Takwah> yes it decreases
[11:09:18] <Takwah> if you say so i will try to apply that coupon scenario but i am not sure if the coupon vs die scenario differs like the tank problem for random vs increasing serial numbers
[11:10:28] <Takwah> thinkig about it you must be right
[11:10:37] <cherim> It's exactly the coupon problem, x-1 is the number of coupons you currently have, dice throw shows which coupon you get, and the coupons are renumbered so that your current collection is {1,2,...x-1} after each throw
[11:10:50] <Takwah> only that coupon collectong starts at x=0
[11:11:47] <Takwah> yes cherim but why x-1 after the throw?
[11:12:12] <cherim> To make throws of x or larger bring a new one
[11:12:34] <cherim> Renumbering doesn't change statistics, only makes it match your original description
[11:12:36] <int-e> So there's a chance this question (distribution of distinct coupons out of k collected coupons, given that there are n in total) has been studied. We can also come up with exact formulas based on Stirling numbers... k!S(k,d)C(n,d)/n^k should be the probability of getting exactly d distinct coupons out of k when there are n distinct coupons
[11:12:55] <cherim> Yes
[11:12:56] <int-e> Where S is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling_numbers_of_the_second_kind, C is combinations (binomial coefficients)

[11:14:26] <Takwah> thank you both as i haved searched the web up and down for dice and nothing remotely near came up
[11:15:06] <cherim> You don't really need the coupon collector formulation for the answer that int-e gave

[11:50:29] <droid3> i know its a stupid question i should know but i am unsure.
[11:52:26] <droid3> not talking about the right side and left side derivatives equaling +inf and -inf. Because then the derivative wouldnt even exist
[11:53:24] <droid3> But i am talking about in an implicit function when you do implicit differentiation of it and wind up with  a/0 or -a/0 where a = number not zero
[11:54:20] <droid3> either way you get inf and -inf for the derivative. And those both corrospond to a vertical tangent line for the implicit function at that point.

[11:55:55] <droid3> the run would be zero and the rise would be either negative distance or positive distance but in any case its a vertical line.

[12:01:28] <droid3> i know i am overkilling this subtlety
[12:02:53] <droid3> but its a curiousity as when one is finding implicit functions tangent lines one occasionally get these cases because these "functions" are now multivalued functions so could give rise to multiple tangent lines at a point or a vertical tangent line.
[12:04:07] <droid3> So anybody want to briefly talk tonight on inf and -inf distinctions for slope of tangent lines ????
[12:05:07] <droid3> Not a difficult question but more wondering if i am missing something or if inf and -inf  are the same vertical tangent line same property of a given singularity point ...etc
[12:05:31] <droid3> or if there is more information to the -inf vs inf value you get for a slope of a tangent line.
[12:06:08] <droid3> Sorry i know its a stupid question but been classifying implicit functions critical points.
[12:06:45] <droid3> Sort of like explicit function of one variable you one got inflection points , min , max when derivative is equal to zero.
[12:07:20] <droid3> And in the case of explicit functions of more then one independent variable you get max , min , or different types of saddle points.

[14:42:14] <W> lpapp, certainly o(n), given there's a closed form formula
[14:42:38] <W> or, I guess you implied you needed each of them, so O(n)
[14:43:00] <W> (given usual assumptions about a computer with sufficient word length etc)
[14:45:02] <Simplar> A present should contain x items, which are cookies and candies, and it should contain at least two cookies. Given that a shopkeeper has y candies and z cookies, when is it possible to put all of them inside presents, and, if it is possible, what is the minimal amount of presents possible under such conditions?
[14:45:06] *** Parts: cadmio (~cadmio@151.57.191.86) (WeeChat 3.0)
[14:45:07] <PlanckWalk> lpapp: The n'th Fibonacci number has length O(a^n) and the combined length of all Fibonacci number up to the n'th also has length O(a^n)
[14:45:35] <PlanckWalk> So from O() point of view, there's no efficient algorithms.
[14:45:37] <W> in practice, once you start talking about really big numbers, and procedures close to O(n), you have to start taking into account the runtime of multiplication and addition and such
[14:46:08] <PlanckWalk> All you can do is try to reduce the constant
[14:46:10] <Simplar> So first of all, I think (y+z) should be divisible by x.
[14:47:13] <Simplar> because each present should have x items
[14:47:23] <W> Simplar, any remainder can just go into the last present, since the problem doesn't say the presents have to be equal
[14:47:34] <PlanckWalk> Unless you meant n as an upper bound on the values, rather than the input.
[14:47:37] <Simplar> W: it has.
[14:47:38] <Simplar> A present should contain x items
[14:47:52] <PlanckWalk> In which case yes, it's O(log n)
[14:47:52] <Simplar> exactly x items
[14:47:55] <W> oh, I guess
[14:48:16] <Simplar> so if the total amount of items is not divisible by x, it's impossible to distribute
[14:48:27] <PlanckWalk> (and even the stupid non-memoized recursive algorithm is O(log n))
[14:49:04] <PlanckWalk> Hmm, I guess it's possible to write a particularly dumb recursive algorithm that isn't O(log n)
[14:49:24] <Simplar> Also at least 2 chocolates are required
[14:49:30] <Simplar> 2 cookies*
[14:49:47] <W> Simplar, yeah, that's right, I just didn't read that part right. The "minimal amount of presents" is confusing
[14:50:02] *** Joins: Svjatoslav (~Svjatosla@62.210.108.187)
[14:50:19] <Simplar> it means that we can keep putting 2 cookies in each present and fill the rest with candies
[14:50:25] <Simplar> or we can spend cookies faster
[14:50:26] <W> if you're buying them all and putting them into presents, and the presents have to have a fixed number of items, the number of presents is fixed as well, no "minimal" about it
[14:51:04] <W> I guess they mean the combinations
[14:51:07] <Simplar> so if cookies are less than candies, we can maximize the amount of presents by putting 2 cookies
[14:51:56] <PlanckWalk> If x, y, z are fixed, how can you make any choices about number of presents at all?

[14:52:37] <Simplar> and minimize the amount of presents by putting n cookies per present, where n is divisible by z, and y is divisible by (x-n)
[14:53:36] <Simplar> PlanckWalk: all shopkeeper gets to choose is how many cookies and candies to put in each present to get x items per present and spend all candies and cookies he has, and there should be 2 cookies or more per present.
[14:53:46] <PlanckWalk> Simplar: Suppose that every present must contain 4 items, and you must use 50 cookies and 14 candies.  What is the least number of presents you can make?  What is the most?
[14:54:10] <PlanckWalk> It looks to me like the minimum is 16 and the maximum is 16.
[14:54:15] <Simplar> (50+14) is divisible by 4, so it is possible

[15:01:07] <Simplar> W: wait why exactly that?
[15:01:23] <PlanckWalk> Yes, there are two conditions that tell you whether it's possible, but no choice in how many when it is possible.
[15:01:54] <Simplar> so this is a catch in that task?

[15:20:16] <Simplar> W: Wait.
[15:20:22] <Simplar> I've misinterpreted the condition.
[15:20:52] <Simplar> A present should contain AT MOST x items, which are cookies and candies, and it should contain at least two cookies. Given that a shopkeeper has y candies and z cookies, when is it possible to put all of them inside presents, and, if it is possible, what is the minimal amount of presents possible under such conditions?
[15:21:05] <Simplar> (capsed 'at most' because it's what I forgot about)
[15:21:13] <W> yeah that makes more sense with the "minimal" there
[15:23:00] *** Joins: [itchyjunk] (~itchyjunk@user/itchyjunk/x-7353470)
[15:23:26] <Simplar> then the condition with 'mod' gets broken
[15:25:05] <Simplar> X, Y, Z are natural numbers, obviously enough
[15:25:06] <[itchyjunk]> hmm
[15:25:38] <Simplar> Thus, (y+z) should be divisible by a natural number from range [1;x]
[15:25:39] <W> so minimum number of packets is max(ceil((y+z)/x),floor(z/2)) to fit it all, if it is possible
[15:26:08] <[itchyjunk]> why does the a function have to be holomorphic inside a closed path C for cauchy theorem to apply?
[15:26:33] <riv> [itchyjunk]: cauchy's theorem is a theorem about holomorphic functions
[15:27:09] <W> wait no, the z/2 is a maximum on number of packets, not minimum, my bad
[15:27:09] <[itchyjunk]> if i go from 0 to pi clock wise or anti clockwise, i should get the same integration right?
[15:27:12] <Simplar> W: again, that's weird
[15:27:21] <[itchyjunk]> wait..
[15:27:22] <riv> if you go anticlockwise you will get the negative

[16:04:24] <Simplar> but how do we know that (z/2) items is a real upper bound?
[16:04:25] <riv> [itchyjunk]: also something quite interesting here is to look at the integral of 1/z^2 (or higher), you will get zero even though you went around a singularity. only 1/z has a residue
[16:04:54] <riv> that will give you a complete picture of x^{n} for all n in Z
[16:06:13] <W> Simplar, if x=1, then the minimum number of packages is simply y+z, which is larger than floor(z/2) for all natural z

[16:17:08] <W> Simplar, it's an upper bound because z is either even or odd, if it's even then z/2 is a natural number (floor does nothing to it) and you can just put two cookies in every package, if its odd then you have to put one extra cookie in one package, and z=2(n-1)+3=2n+1 where n is the (natural) number of packages, so floor(z/2)=floor((2n+1)/2)=floor(n+1/2) and since n is a natural number, floor(n+1/2)=n
[16:18:37] <[itchyjunk]> okay found my mistake, left out the z from 2zdz = 4pi i e^{4pi i t} dt
[16:19:26] <[itchyjunk]> i get 2pi i int_0^1 e ^{-2pi i t} dt = -e^{2pi i t}|_0^1 = -1 + 1 = 0
[16:19:31] <riv> excellent
[16:20:22] <riv> now integrals are additive, so if f(z) is any holomorphic function, you can consider the integral of a loop around 0 of f(z)+c/z and immediately know the holmorphic part disappears and you get 2 pi i c

[18:59:54] <greenbagels> or i should say "intuitively motivated)
[19:04:07] <Z-module> If S is any commutative ring, S[x] (the polynomials over S) are essentially just what you get by introducing a new object 'x' into S, that commutes with everything and obeys no other relations. So x, xx, xxx, ... (AKA x, x^2, x^3, ...) are mutually distinct, and you can multiply any of them with something from S, and add finitely many such things together. It's clean and simple.

Any time you have any finite group H acting on a finite set X (which is O(S) in this case, meaning the orbit of S from the full G's action), every orbit O(x)  (now from H's action only) has order that divides |H|, because  |O(x)| = |H : H_x| = |H|/|H_x|.

[23:00:52] <somiaj> could you create a counter example where say you multiply by 1/(x-a), some matrix that the (x-a) cancels out everywhere in this operation, thus M'(a) and M(a) exists, but you would have to divide by zero to get between the two causing an issue?
[23:01:07] <Z-module> Why won't the same row operations from the matrix version still work?
[23:02:16] <Z-module> (from the F(x) version, I meant)
[23:02:57] <somiaj> for instance [ (x-1)(x-2), (x-1)(x-3); (x-1)(x-4), (x-1)(x-5) ] = M, multiply by 1/(x-a) to get [(x-2), (x-3); (x-4), (x-5)], thus M(1) = [0, 0; 0, 0] while M'(1) = [ -1, -2; -3, -4 ]? Or did I missunderstand?
[23:04:20] <somiaj> arg, a=1, so multiply by 1/(x-1)
[23:05:07] <qergle> can it be said that [(x-2), (x-3); (x-4), (x-5)] is "row-operation equivalent"?
[23:06:45] <qergle> seems there's implicit restrictions when going from M to M' using row operations, that you can't ignore when dealing with M(a) and M'(a)
[23:08:20] <somiaj> well they just said M and M' have values at some argument a, not that every elementary row operation did, to me you need that stronger condition to ensure that M'(a) and M(a) can be obtained from each other using elementary row operations over F
[23:08:52] <somiaj> while seems you are assuming that strong condition is implied.

[23:11:44] <qergle> if not every step along the way is valid
[23:12:05] <somiaj> The difference isn't that, the difference is working in the field F(x) vs F
[23:12:18] <somiaj> and if you can translate between the two at some value x=a
[23:12:30] <qergle> the underlying field is not the roadblock
[23:12:44] <qergle> i don't think it's valid to say M' is row-op equivalent to M

[23:51:26] <cuppajoeman> Yeah you need to do something with equivalence classes. This paragraph I quoted comes way before that in the proof though

[23:56:20] <cuppajoeman> So if you add a new constant to the language, but you don't change the set of formulas you're working with you can do that because none of the formulas claim anything about the new constants?

[23:57:48] <cuppajoeman> we're trying to create a model
[23:57:57] <int-e> cuppajoeman: "Then by adding all these new constants the above statement becomes falsified" just isn't true. This is because different constants can have the same value in the model.
