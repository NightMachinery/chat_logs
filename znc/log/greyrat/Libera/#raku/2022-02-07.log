[02:01:42] <dorkdoggler> raku has good support for unicode and even some logic/math symbols are there any libraries/modules that do SAT to 3MAP¬† "solving" so you could make a machine that works directly with statement/clause like A‚à®B‚à®‚àºC instead of having to parse encode everything? I'm looking at this python library and exercise:
[02:01:43] <dorkdoggler> https://sahandsaba.com/understanding-sat-by-implementing-a-simple-sat-solver-in-python.html and wondering if any perlistas or rakistas(? rakuites? rakuians?) have worked on modules/libraries/grammars in the area. Where do I search raku modules?
[02:03:06] <dorkdoggler> I found https://github.com/taboege/raku-SAT-Solver-MiniSAT
[02:04:11] <jdv> some peeps like "rakoon".  im not a fan.
[02:06:14] <dorkdoggler> cool ... I thought maybe there were more raku modules I might have missed somewhere. I guess I'm used to CPAN (with decades of uploads :-D) After a few weeks I conclude that raku seems to be a simpler to use language "plain" ... with more built in so less modules needed (and having had less time to build them).
[02:07:18] <MasterDuke> i think that's a pretty accurate assessment
[02:07:31] <jdv> perhaps.  raku is younger.  cpan is older:)
[02:08:14] <jdv> amusingly there are raku modules ar cpan so its not so clear cut:)

[02:12:18] <MasterDuke> yes(-ish, i think, i don't really use NativeCall so am not the best person to ask)
[02:13:20] <dorkdoggler> MasterDuke yeah I used it with a couple of C libraries and am not an expert. But it made me think raku has already take over the world and no one noticed
[02:18:50] <dorkdoggler> I don't know if it's easier or faster than FFI::Platypus (perl5) but only because FFI::Platypus is not built-in and doesn't get as much use (usually cuz there's 12 perl modules that do the thing some c library can do).

[23:39:14] <frank26> Hi, I have a problem wrt to building a module of mine with the debian package of rakudo. This is the module https://github.com/soundart/perl6-tweetnacl. I do "zef install ." and end with "/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -latomic_ops"
[23:41:32] <frank26> If I remove atomic_ops from the generated Makefile the module seems to be working.
[23:44:09] <[Coke]> ? what is -atomic_ops? 
[23:44:17] <[Coke]> ? what is -latomic_ops? 
[23:45:37] *** Quits: Darkcoal (~user@user/Darkcoal) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[23:46:13] <[Coke]> the only atomic_ops I have in my makefile is:
[23:46:17] <[Coke]>     -I'/Volumes/BUKKIT/Users/coke/sandbox/rakudo/install/include/libatomic_ops' \
[23:47:44] *** Joins: Darkcoal (~user@user/Darkcoal)
[23:49:39] <[Coke]> File::Which should update to check for raku as a test instead of perl6
[23:49:59] <frank26> Hm that seems to be the directory containing the headers files of that library. -latomic_ops is for the linker.
[23:50:22] <[Coke]> I assume you mean the rakudo makefile, though it's not clear how that impacts your module.
[23:51:30] <[Coke]> (I was able to do a zef install --dry . in the module checkout, no errors) (I'm on OS X, though)
[23:53:06] <frank26> "zef" creates for my module a Makefile. In that Makefile is a linker line referring to atomic_ops

[23:54:46] <ugexe> maybe something from LibraryMake that you use? https://github.com/retupmoca/P6-LibraryMake/blob/1c6bf1d0e427e51d880ac237e6d168c4919adbfd/lib/LibraryMake.pm6#L144-L147
[23:55:19] <[Coke]> ah. issue with LibraryMake perhaps? Or your debian package of rakudo being misconfigured?
[23:59:06] <frank26> Yes I think this https://github.com/soundart/perl6-tweetnacl/blob/master/Makefile.in#L9 gets expanded with %LIBS%

[23:59:19] <[Coke]> it concerns me that debian's version is still calling itself Perl 6
