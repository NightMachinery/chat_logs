People here were puzzled, so I'm following up. The issue was resolved by adding "i8042.reset i8042.nomux i8042.nopnp i8042.noloop" to the kernel startup parameters. Interestingly

[03:12:11] <knghtbrd> It may wind up that the specific hardware could be identified or something specific indicating this or that doesn't work might cause the reset or … something. Basically, it's just best if these things are detected if possible or the general case "just works". May not be practical, but it's worth exploring.

[11:25:31] <knghtbrd> we're doing pretty well, I think—if you're new here, I should tell you this channel isn't really intended as a social hangout, though. Don't mind being friendly, but we ask that priority be given to support when people need help.
[11:26:19] <knghtbrd> (is #debian-offtopic really populated on this network? It's generally moderately active on OFTC…)
[11:27:13] * knghtbrd doesn't wanna tell people they should check it out if nobody's there! 😛
[11:27:39] <budlight> is there a irc channel to talk about debian not the support of debian
[11:28:58] <budlight> or is debian-offtopic the channel
[11:29:01] <knghtbrd> On OFTC there's #debian-offtopic, I don't know if the same channel on this net is as active. While people aren't acking for help with stuff it's probably safe to talk about here … but like I said, we try to give way for help when people need it
[11:29:24] * knghtbrd doesn't use libra as much currently
[11:30:09] <knghtbrd> I'd gone stage 7 again for awhile and came back to freenode being basically exploded and this network being a thing.
[11:31:21] <knghtbrd> er, 6, I guess technically I'm at 7 now again.
[11:31:52] <knghtbrd> (level/stage 6 is escape from irc, having a real life, etc. 7 is the relapse.)

[11:43:48] <knghtbrd> This machine was originally Linux Mint 20 for work purposes, but I no longer really needed to run Mint to provide Mint support, so I went back to Debian. Then I realized that the old installer didn't want to activate a LUKS container without formatting it first. I have two LVM VGs on 32 TB worth of LUKS encrypted drives.
[11:44:23] <knghtbrd> But debootstrap and I are not strangers, so I basically installed sid like you'd install Arch. ;)
[11:45:10] <knghtbrd> That way I didn't have to restore that 32TB from backup after installing the new OS … Not even the 4TB of the SSDs

[11:48:02] <knghtbrd> Trying to do it in a couple of hours before I started a support shift was maybe not the most wise solution.
[11:49:08] <budlight> ah do you get paid for your work
[11:51:26] <knghtbrd> nah, I'm a legally blind cancer patient in the middle of a pandemic with chemo side-effects … working a 9-5 right now is a LITTLE tough, so I volunteer as a support intern with Free Geek.
[11:52:17] <knghtbrd> It's something to do right now while they're really short-staffed, and I can take some really complex stuff the others can't really take the time to do, etc.

[13:58:19] <Psy-Q> you can buy Consolas starting at 49 EUR, but there are a bunch of good code-specific fonts that are free (beer and source) too
[13:58:42] <Psy-Q> IBM Plex Mono, Hack, etc.
[13:59:32] <Psy-Q> there's also a big pile over here, patched with symbols for "git branch" or "kubernetes logo" and stuff like that, it's also a good overview of coding fonts in general IMO: https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads

[14:04:41] <Psy-Q> they are quite different though: http://www.identifont.com/differences?first=Consolas&second=Hack

[19:15:14] <artag> I just retired stretch. Tried to upgrade to buster but couldn't get video working so I gave in and did a new install of bullseye
[19:16:07] <artag>  which actually was just the same, but I was committed then and had to make it work

[19:18:22] <Khepra> what problems?
[19:18:32] <queue[m]> just install 11 as new, im not sure why 10 -> 11 is such an issue
[19:18:52] <queue[m]> random things breaking in the desktop environment, i didnt experience them but they are widely known. i only run servers so they didnt effect me
[19:19:05] <artag> yeah that's why I was initially going for buster, bullseye is a bit new for me
[19:19:27] <artag> but hey. live dangerously.
[19:19:38] <queue[m]> you want to be on 11, its just the upgrade from 10 to 11 seems to break some things
[19:20:17] <Khepra> queue[m]: what's widely known? do you have an example?
[19:20:56] <artag> right, glad i didn't go the slow route then. This machine started out a long time ago and it's got a lot of cruft from multiple upgrades
[19:21:20] <Khepra> there's a bit of FUD going on here....
[19:22:44] <abrotman> artag: did you ask for help solving your video problems?
[19:23:57] <tesseract> if you read the release notes, you don't get any problem when upgrading
[19:24:18] <artag> no. I did ask for help with a networking problem that preceded it, but fixed that. The video problem was a bit tedious to find but I've mostly got there
[19:24:49] <artag> could do with improving it though if you've got some ideas

[19:25:52] <artag> I have an Nvidia 9600 GT which is old and barely supported.
[19:27:48] <artag> but the particular problem I had even with the fresh bullseye install is that my monitor is VGA and the Nvidia is DVI
[19:28:13] <artag> there's an adapter but it doesn't seem to pass the monitor id informationm through

[19:29:17] <artag> nouveau, when it can't get monitor ID, seems to default to something weird like 203x309 pixels and creates an unusable signal
[19:30:28] <artag> Then I read the monitor with another machine and made up an xorg.conf
[19:30:55] <artag> that got it working, but the gamma it put in that file was bad and the picture was all washed out

[19:33:27] <artag> On the upgrade to buster and the networking, I was left after the upgrade with both an eth0 interface and something to do with the VM loopback. This seemed to upset it such that almost all the frames on eth0 were getting filtered out
[19:39:53] <artag> the gamma thing was a real pain. I went round adjusting everthing I could to try to get a reasonable brightness / contrast / font shape choices

[19:41:06] <artag> I've been puzzled about why everyone suddenly wants 'dark mode' and i think the reason is that antialiased fonts behave very differently in dark vs light text

[22:17:09] <mattb00ne> I am not sure
[22:17:24] <mattb00ne> I have my ethernet cable plugged in
[22:17:34] <bigMouthCommie> i've failed about 6 times to install debian 11 from a burned dvd. the problem each time has come with installing grub. i've tried from the graphical installer, booting in efi, and creating a separate efi partition (though i don't think it ever managed to format it as exfat), in bios mode with no efi (still fails??), and with the live distro running in efi
[22:17:39] <bigMouthCommie> any tips?
[22:17:50] <mattb00ne> I can browse the web but the network manager icon still shows as not connected
[22:17:58] <bigMouthCommie> i do want to preserve one of the partitions, so i always manually set up partitions
[22:18:06] <mattb00ne> I am not sure how that is possible
[22:18:29] <mattb00ne> I was on buster before switching to 11
[22:18:54] <sussudio> mattb00ne: you have checked your logs already, right.
[22:19:03] <mattb00ne> in debian 10 I would get the now connected prompt and I would have that network icon when I was connected to the internet
[22:20:03] <mattb00ne> no I am terrible at internet stuff... What are some commands I can use to see what is going. I ask because I need to be able to switch between the internet and a SBC
[22:20:24] <mattb00ne> but since I have no idea how I am connecting cannot troubleshoot the SBC issue
[22:21:30] <Psy-Q> bigMouthCommie: i'm not sure how exfat plays into this, it should be fat32 AFAIK

[22:24:26] <bigMouthCommie> Psy-Q: oh. maybe.
[22:25:06] <bigMouthCommie> i'm pretty bad with efi. i still consider it new-fangled. when i set it up, i set it as bootable, mounted in /boot/efi. is taht right?
[22:27:59] <Psy-Q> bigMouthCommie: that seems correct but i always used fat32, seeing that exfat was a FUSE driver last time i checked (?) i'm really not sure if it can ever be bootable
[22:28:27] <bigMouthCommie> ok. i'll try it again from the live installer
[22:28:31] <bigMouthCommie> wish me luck!

[22:53:35] <queue[m]> it means that opening didn't fail
[22:53:59] <queue[m]> if the file is a reg ffile and not tty, ioctl fails and sets errno

[22:58:23] <queue[m]> can you show the code? i can point you out the error im sure
[22:58:49] <bigMouthCommie> i just said "force uefi" and now i'm choosing manual partitioning
[22:59:48] <queue[m]> lightyear_ are you trying to configure terminal properties in echo mode?
[23:00:14] <queue[m]> on a file descriptor that was no terminal at all, just a file
[23:00:18] <Psy-Q> bigMouthCommie: hm, why did you have to force UEFI? did you boot the USB stick in UEFI mode or BIOS/legacy mode, perhaps?
[23:00:38] <Psy-Q> in my BIOS at least it lets me choose how to boot the installer and if i don't pick UEFI things get wonky very quickly
[23:00:51] <lightyear_> I'm literally trying to do perl -MCPAN -e shell queue[m], but I've never had this issue before.
[23:00:58] <queue[m]> lightyear_: try export GPG_TTY=$(tty)
[23:01:46] <anonymous> usb stick should be booted only in legacy mode
