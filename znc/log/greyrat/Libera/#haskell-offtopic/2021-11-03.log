[01:10:03] <monochrom> heehee
[01:10:24] <hpc> there's a great joke i wish i could find again, about renaming all the number types
[01:10:33] <hpc> real numbers are now the complex numbers, because real analysis is hard
[01:10:42] <hpc> complex numbers are now the rational numbers, because complex analysis is easy
[01:10:45] <hpc> etc etc
[01:14:06] <davean> hpc: No, its about integers and we all ahve a sense they sorta actually exist. If you want it to be math, the practical existance needs to be in question

[15:27:36] <[exa]> re the GDPR conversation yesterday: experts say that IRC staff (and likely channel staff, transitively) are technically "controllers" and the users must be informed that their stuff is collected
[15:28:20] <[exa]> other than that it's likely pretty much compliant, once there's big fat sign "DANGER LOGS" the users should know not to say anything they don't want logged
[15:28:24] <[exa]> tomsmeding: cc ^
[15:29:47] <geekosaur> there's a logs notification in the /topic, does that count as notification?
[15:30:02] <[exa]> yeah, I think that a mildly more explicit message in the topic should do
[15:30:16] <dminuoso> Consent of the data subject means any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject’s wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her.
[15:30:47] <dminuoso> [exa]: Im almost entirely sure that merely informing is not consent.
[15:31:20] <[exa]> maybe we'll need a consentbot then
[15:32:02] <dminuoso> Also
[15:32:04] <dminuoso> 2. If the data subject’s consent is given in the context of a written declaration which also concerns other matters, the request for consent shall be presented in a manner which is clearly distinguishable from the other matters, in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language. Any part of such a declaration which constitutes an infringement of this
[15:32:05] <dminuoso> Regulation shall not be binding.
[15:32:08] <hpc> when you join libera there's a link to https://libera.chat/policies/ in the server motd, which includes the logging and data retention info
[15:32:25] <dminuoso> If you're using an IRC client that does not even clearly make the entire topic visible, then you're not even informing.
[15:32:32] <dminuoso> hpc: That's assuming your client even presents that.
[15:32:49] <dminuoso> If Im using a client that does not present that note, what then?
[15:33:01] <hpc> websites assume your browser displays "position: fixed" elements too
[15:33:07] <dminuoso> Also
[15:33:16] <dminuoso> Passive acceptance does not fall under
[15:33:18] <dminuoso> "freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication"
[15:33:24] <dminuoso> Otherwise, we wouldnt have any consent terror banners.
[15:33:31] <hpc> that's true

[15:34:16] <dminuoso> Contains explanations on the various terms
[15:34:33] <[exa]> perhaps freenode chose the only gdpr-compliant path by eliminating itself? :D
[15:34:42] <dminuoso> In particular:
[15:34:44] <dminuoso> “Freely given” consent essentially means you have not cornered the data subject into agreeing to you using their data. For one thing, that means you cannot require consent to data processing as a condition of using the service. They need to be able to say no. According to Recital 42, “Consent should not be regarded as freely given if the data subject has no genuine or free choice or
[15:34:46] <dminuoso> is unable to refuse or withdraw consent without detriment.”
[15:34:53] <dminuoso> Take particular note of the emphasis:
[15:34:56] <dminuoso> "They need to be able to say no"
[15:35:12] <dminuoso> And the example at the end
[15:35:16] *** Joins: merijn (~merijn@83-160-49-249.ip.xs4all.nl)
[15:35:18] <dminuoso> “Consent should not be regarded as freely given if the data subject has no genuine or free choice or is unable to refuse or withdraw consent without detriment.”
[15:35:48] <dminuoso> [exa]: So Im curious why your GDPR lawyers think this would be sufficient. It seems almost obviously wrong.
[15:36:38] <dminuoso> Now, even if you said "But users could revoke that consent on tomsmeding's website", that would again violate this part:
[15:36:49] <dminuoso> However, a data subject has the right to withdraw consent at any time. Moreover, you must make it easy for them to do so. In general, it should be as easy for them to withdraw consent as it was for you to obtain consent.
[15:37:02] <dminuoso> Passive consent is miles easier than figuring out a website, and clicking through forms to revoke again
[15:37:40] <dminuoso> So even under the assumption (!) that passive consent was acceptable, the consent would be much harder to revoke, and you have no option to actually say no.

[16:28:12] <merijn> dminuoso: What was the context? (about the GDPR stuff)
[16:29:29] <dminuoso> merijn: tomsmeding's ircbrowse website
[16:30:30] <dminuoso> So my stance is, he is the controller and excercising data processing and profiling without a legal basis. 
[16:31:22] <merijn> Under the argument that public discussion is personal data?
[16:31:40] <dminuoso> Well the data is personally identifiable through my online handle
[16:31:50] <dminuoso> And GDPR explicit mentions online handles as valid personal identifiers
[16:32:36] <merijn> I think there's no reasonable expectation of privacy on IRC, though
[16:32:51] <merijn> The same way there wouldn't be if I was shouting stuff on a public square
[16:33:00] <dminuoso> What do you mean by reasonable expectation of privacy?
[16:33:10] <dminuoso> What part of GDPR are you thinking of?
[16:33:19] <dminuoso> I dont see any exemption clause that would apply.
[16:34:27] <dminuoso> As per Material Scope, Article 2, GDPR applies to: This Regulation applies to the processing of personal data wholly or partly by automated means and to the processing other than by automated means of personal data which form part of a filing system or are intended to form part of a filing system.
[16:34:35] <merijn> dminuoso: I'm not thinking of any exemptions at all. I'm wondering whether the GDPR applies at all
[16:34:44] <dminuoso> The material excemption clause of 2) does provide anything of the sort
[16:35:09] <merijn> dminuoso: By that logic anyone on IRC is a processor, though
[16:35:31] <dminuoso> merijn: Nope
[16:35:32] <merijn> dminuoso: Mostly due to the insanely generic scope of the GDPR
[16:35:37] <merijn> dminuoso: No? Why not?
[16:35:38] <dminuoso> The phrase "processing" is well defined:
[16:35:47] <dminuoso> ‘processing’ means any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination,
[16:35:48] <dminuoso> restriction, erasure or destruction;
[16:36:04] <dminuoso> But sure
[16:36:09] <merijn> dminuoso: And your client does not record logs?
[16:36:22] <dminuoso> Well. Now we get to exemption clauses:
[16:36:23] <merijn> Seems pretty obviously a lot of IRC clients/users do
[16:36:27] <dminuoso> As per material scope:
[16:36:30] <dminuoso> 2 This Regulation does not apply to the processing of personal data:
[16:36:33] <dminuoso> by a natural person in the course of a purely personal or household activity;
[16:36:45] <dminuoso> If I store this on my personal computer, this exemption clause applies.
[16:36:56] <merijn> dminuoso: I'm logged in from a work laptop, though
[16:37:04] <merijn> As, I imagine, are lots of other people
[16:37:09] <merijn> And I am on here during work
[16:37:20] <dminuoso> Is your participation work related?
[16:37:30] <merijn> With some regularity
[16:37:40] <dminuoso> In that case, arguably, GDPR applies.
[16:37:44] <merijn> dminuoso: As is yours :p
[16:37:48] <dminuoso> Yes. :)
[16:38:11] <merijn> dminuoso: That's my point *arguably* the GDPR applies to discussions and nicknames on IRC
[16:38:14] <dminuoso> Yeah
[16:38:23] <dminuoso> But the weight of tomsmeding's ircbrowse is a bit wider
[16:38:28] <dminuoso> Since all that data is publically available ontop
[16:38:31] <merijn> dminuoso: My point about the absense of reasonable expectation of privacy it remains to be seen whether a judge agrees
[16:38:44] <dminuoso> merijn: expectation of privacy is not necessary for GDPR.
[16:38:44] <merijn> dminuoso: Arguably people made that data publically themselves
[16:38:53] <dminuoso> Otherwise that would be one big mighty loophole
[16:39:03] <merijn> dminuoso: I didn't say it's necessary, you're thinking like a programmer
[16:39:13] <merijn> Like programmers always do in legal discussions
[16:39:19] <merijn> Which doesn't work
[16:39:30] <merijn> The question is: Would a judge rule the GDPR applies?
[16:39:50] <merijn> And judge will certainly consider the fact that IRC is a blatantly public and *not* private affair
[16:40:16] <dminuoso> merijn: But that's the thing, the GDPR makes absolutely no distinction whatsoever whether data are publically available or not.
[16:40:27] <dminuoso> This gets sort of interesting when you talk about scraping bots
[16:40:34] <merijn> dminuoso: I don't care what the GDPR says
[16:40:47] <merijn> dminuoso: I care how a hypothetical judge *interprets* what it says
[16:41:24] <merijn> How *we* interpret it, is entirely irrelevant, except as a matter of determining what we think our legal risk is
[16:41:45] <merijn> I mean, the real answer is "talk to a lawyer if you're concerned"
[16:42:19] <dminuoso> I guess so
[16:42:49] <merijn> dminuoso: Also, whether your nickname counts as "identifiable real person" is a matter of debate
[16:42:59] <merijn> s/real/natural
[16:43:12] <dminuoso> ‘personal data’ means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an ***online identifier*** or to one or more factors specific to the physical,
[16:43:14] <dminuoso> physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person;
[16:43:16] <dminuoso> Emphasis added by me
[16:43:50] <dminuoso> So nicknames are considered explicitly
[16:45:53] <merijn> can you be identified by your online identifier?
[16:45:57] <dminuoso> Yes.
[16:46:02] <merijn> How so?
[16:46:40] <dminuoso> I *can* be identified simply by looking at other publically available profiles. 
[16:46:55] <dminuoso> My real name is on my github profile, same nickname.
[16:47:35] <dminuoso> I mean yeah, we're back into legal interpretation, but I *can* be *identified* *indirectly* by reference to [...] an online identifier.
[16:48:07] <merijn> Well, better shutdown IRC then :)
[16:48:21] <dminuoso> GDPR definitely wasnt invented with much technical foresight
[16:48:25] <dminuoso> email is a much worse example
[16:48:49] <dminuoso> Especially since we already have rulings that email addresses are considered personal data
[16:50:20] <dminuoso> merijn: Either way, I think tomsmeding's ircbrowse website goes into the direction what GDPR tries to avoid.
[16:50:23] <dminuoso> Consider this:
[16:50:42] <dminuoso> https://ircbrowse.tomsmeding.com/nick/dminuoso
[16:50:52] <dminuoso> With some interpretation, this can be seen as *profiling* (as per GDPR definitions)
[16:51:18] <dminuoso> In particular it could be considered as giving indivation of my location or sleep rhythm. Making this data publically available is more than just questionable.
[16:51:59] <dminuoso> Personally I wouldn't operate ircbrowse on a publically available website without having a GDPR specialized lawyer giving a nod.
[16:52:03] <dminuoso> It seems too risky

[16:53:53] <lortabac> also, there must some way to delete all the data of a user
[16:54:10] <lortabac> is it possible on ircbrowse?
[16:54:19] *** Joins: kuribas (~user@ptr-25vy0i9fcjh581tavd9.18120a2.ip6.access.telenet.be)
[16:54:24] <dminuoso> lortabac: As long as there's a contact form, you can send him an email
[16:54:50] <lortabac> yes, AFAIK it doesn't need to be fully automated
[16:55:10] <dminuoso> Yup. In our company we dont have an automated mechanism to accomplish that.
[16:55:14] <merijn> It doesn't need to be automated at all
[16:55:18] <lortabac> but is it technically possible to delete a user on ircbrowse?
[16:55:25] <dminuoso> Technically? Sure.
[16:55:34] *** Quits: jpds (~jpds@gateway/tor-sasl/jpds) (Remote host closed the connection)
[16:55:41] <dminuoso> The question is just how much effort it is.
[16:55:55] *** Joins: jpds (~jpds@gateway/tor-sasl/jpds)
[16:56:37] <dminuoso> At the end, I think even adding a *notice* in the channels would help. Even though it wouldn't be a real legal basis, the way fines work - the less dark patterns you employ the better.
[16:58:42] <merijn> I wanna go back to Web 1.0 and before :(
[17:31:55] <janus> merijn: usenet is still alive :)
[17:32:19] <janus> or did you mean to go back to before the printing press was invented?
[17:34:07] <merijn> I meant before we tried to commercialise it all
[17:34:17] <merijn> using shitty tech
[17:35:10] <merijn> When most things were fun niche things, instead of commercialised, SEO'd garbage
[17:35:30] <janus> i too would like to return to the stone age :P
[17:36:05] <merijn> Things like everything2
[17:36:19] <merijn> Which I see is still happily ad free
[17:48:21] <geekosaur> fwiw freenode at one point strongly recommended such notices, and I think had a chanserv-based mechanism for them. might be worth looking into on libera

[19:11:55] <geekosaur> and it's probably wise to have an unlogged equivalent to the channel. for #haskell, #haskell-beginners might suffice; I'm thinking about an #xmonad-unlogged
[19:12:17] <geekosaur> (I think those are the only channels tomsmeding is currently logging?)
