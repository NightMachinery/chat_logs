[01:38:25] <imode> interesting ethical question is.. do these entities have the right to keep this particular user's code in service.
[01:38:36] <albertito> that helps a little with handling operational issues, but it still leaves a centralized registry

[01:39:12] <albertito> go is the only one I've seen handling this well (this being the non-centralization of package hosting or listing)
[01:39:31] <imode> go doesn't support gitlab or private git repos iirc
[01:40:05] <albertito> imode: it supports both

[01:40:43] <imode> ah, my knowledge is out of date then.
[01:41:10] <albertito> imode: you can even decouple the package name from the hosting, so you can name your package myhost.com/mypkg and still host your git repo on github, but it's abstracted away in case you want to move later

[03:11:51] <constxd> iDrougge: is there something similar for when you have two arguments?
[03:12:31] <iDrougge> Not in Kotlin. Swift uses `xs.filter { $0 > 4 }` so that implicit arguments are numbered.
[03:13:00] <constxd> in Swift is { $0 > 4 } an expression?
[03:13:07] <iDrougge> It’s a closure.
[03:13:29] <constxd> man that is tempting the only reason i haven't done it yet is

[03:13:48] <constxd> and i don't know what else to use for that
[03:14:04] <iDrougge> Swift uses `[key: value]` for dict literals.

[03:14:26] <iDrougge> [:]
[03:14:29] <constxd> also does Swift have sets
[03:14:47] <constxd> i use { } with no : for sets, e.g., {1, 2, 3}
[03:15:11] <iDrougge> Yes. `let s: Set<Int> = [1, 2, 3]`
[03:15:22] <constxd> wtf
[03:15:27] <constxd> how does that work
[03:15:38] <constxd> what is the type of [1, 2, 3]
[03:15:50] <iDrougge> There is no set literal, so if you did not specify the type, type inference would make s an array.
[03:16:09] <iDrougge> The type of [1, 2, 3] is ArrayLiteral.
[03:16:35] <iDrougge> Both Array and Set implement ExpressibleByArrayLiteral, as can any type do.
[03:16:41] <constxd> ah
[03:16:45] <constxd> was just about to ask

[12:12:56] <munksgaard> Good morning everyone! Inspired by the recent article about mesh networks, I'm looking for another blog post or article I read a year or two ago which I can't seem to find again. It was describing in pretty straightforward terms how to set up your own self-hosted mesh "internet". Something like "First you take a rpi or something similar and install your own document and file cloud on it. Then you can create a new "homepage" for your
[12:12:56] <munksgaard> household, which has links to these services and perhaps a gateway to the outside internet. Then you can run a cable to your neighbor who has done the same thing, and you can share and access each others' services, and so on". It kept going for a while, describing how this would essentially create a new decentralized network to rival the internet, but with each user in charge of their own services and data
[12:13:13] <munksgaard> Does anyone remember that article or have the google/ddg skills to find it for me?

[12:21:30] <arnt> Forget about it — those posts are theory, not practice. "X should work", but you don't need help as long as you stay with "should".
[12:23:54] <munksgaard> I'm not sure exactly what you're saying. Yes, those things are often a pipedream, but it's not out of the question to self-host a lot of services that we currently rely on big corporations for.
[12:24:10] <munksgaard> It's also not out of the question to link your network up with your neighbors network, if you both agree on it
[12:26:09] <arnt> If what you want is to selfhost, look for nextclould and alternatives to it. "nextcloud rpi" is similar. If you want a network larger than a couple of buildings, you're more or less on your own, because the people who do that with success are overwhelmingly ISPs, even if they weren't when they started.
[12:27:06] <arnt> A friend of mine was involved in what (I think) is/was the largest mesh network so far. It closed.
[12:27:14] <munksgaard> To be sure, the blogpost/article I'm looking for was not a complete guide to setting up anything like that, it was more of a theoretical exploration of what could be done, if we really decided to try.

[20:15:46] <kline> (but broadly yeah, for those following along at home templates are done by the compiler, so you have to have the template definition visible where it is used, and that generally means #include'ing it, which generally means putting implementations in the headers, not the source files - which generally stay separate until link time)

[20:25:03] <ngoldbaum> i understand i’m asking for a unicorn at some level
[20:25:08] <gwozniak> Header files are damn annoying
[20:25:24] <ngoldbaum> even rust has this problem at some level
[20:25:26] <iDrougge> At least it is, amazingly, one of few C "innovations" which haven't been aped by other languages.
[20:26:02] <companion_cube> I guess everyone realized that headers were a garbage fire, early enough
[20:26:11] <iDrougge> The closest thing must be def files in Modula-2.
[20:26:21] <ngoldbaum> not headers but also sometimes needing to understand e.g. the binary layout of a struct because the compiler isn’t sufficiently advanced to tell me i’m doing something inefficient or optimize it somehow
[20:26:38] <gwozniak> If you're programming at the system level, you should be familiar with how the linker works, even with statically linked things.  (Unless your app is entirely self-contained.)
[20:26:46] <iDrougge> ngoldbaum: The Go compiler?
[20:27:41] <ngoldbaum> go is nice for some things but the GC makes it a no-go for a lot of lower level applications where C++ gets used a lot
[20:28:31] <iDrougge> I was thinking of the fact that it doesn't try to optimise struct organisation.
[20:28:37] <ngoldbaum> gwozniak: and yet i (and lots of other people I’m sure) was handed a couple million lines of C++ with very little formal CS education or systems programming training :/
[20:28:45] <ngoldbaum> oh i see
[20:29:12] <companion_cube> iDrougge: having files with just an interface is good
[20:29:15] <companion_cube> headers are not that
[20:31:13] <iDrougge> I can't recall having missed such a thing, but perhaps I'm missing out on something?
[20:31:19] <gwozniak> ngoldbaum: yeah, that's a part of the C/C++ education that I'm not keen on.
[20:32:02] <companion_cube> iDrougge: it's useful if you like encapsulation: have a file where you just expose the public API, without showing implementation, etc.
[20:32:12] <companion_cube> and then another file where you write the actual code and private functions.
[20:32:27] <companion_cube> definitely on the more strict end of the design spectrum
[20:32:51] <iDrougge> I find it so much simpler to just write "private" or "public" in the source file than to keep two separate files in sync.
[20:32:56] <ngoldbaum> but because of that template rule in C++ headers also have a lot of other crap in them
[20:33:03] <companion_cube> it's a defensible choice too
[20:33:11] <companion_cube> but then you can't just skim a small file to see the API

[22:57:32] <companion_cube> and now someone is arguing that smalltalk/ruby are inspired by lisp? ôO
[22:57:59] <drakonis> it sure is a thread.
[22:58:01] <technomancy> ruby's author has made that argument
[22:58:22] <companion_cube> it's not even on him :D
[22:58:45] <companion_cube> question is smalltalk, and I wonder how it's a lisp… besides the dynamic typing aspect
[22:59:28] <iDrougge> At least they seemed to compete for a similar niche in the 80s with custom workstations. Tektronix made both Smalltalk and Lisp workstations.
[23:00:09] <companion_cube> I, too, work with a lisp derivative… that's stronly typed :p
[23:01:16] <drakonis> yes...
[23:01:17] <technomancy> at the time simply having a repl and being expression-oriented was revolutionary
[23:01:18] <drakonis> ocaml...
[23:01:22] <companion_cube> (first implementation of caml was even implemented with: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Lisp)
[23:01:42] <technomancy> I don't think Alan Kay was shy about admitting his lisp influences

[23:02:07] <technomancy> "So, Ruby was a Lisp originally, in theory. Let's call it MatzLisp from now on. ;-)"
[23:02:35] <iDrougge> But Smalltalk was a much bigger influence on Ruby, wasn’t it?
[23:02:50] <technomancy> yes, absolutely, but lisp influenced smalltalk too
[23:03:09] <companion_cube> tbh "influenced" is a pretty loose word anyway
[23:03:20] <companion_cube> like, lisp influenced rust transitively
[23:03:29] <companion_cube> rust is still pretty damn far from a lisp
[23:04:31] <iDrougge> Every language will sooner or later give birth to a bad implementation of Smalltalk, to quote smug Lisp weenies.
[23:04:47] <iDrougge> Case in point: Objective-C, ooRexx.
