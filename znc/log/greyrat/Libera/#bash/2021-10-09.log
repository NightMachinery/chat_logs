[03:07:26] <NRK[m]> i don't really find myself using printf much, unless explicitly needed.
[03:07:36] <NRK[m]> any reason why "POSIX fans" would prefer printf?
[03:07:55] <jetchisel> !echo
[03:07:55] <greybot> echo outputs a string. echo has many portability problems, and should never be used with option flags. Consider printf instead: printf 'name: %s\n' "$name". http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/commands/builtin/echo | http://cfajohnson.com/shell/cus-faq.html#Q0b | http://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/various/echo+printf
[03:09:29] <NRK[m]> so echo without any options is still non-portable?
[03:10:37] <koala_man> the output differs on various platforms, yes
[03:10:59] <koala_man> d# echo 'foo\nbar'
[03:11:00] <shbot> koala_man: foo

[07:31:44] <midnite> Hi, I have a one-liner that output an integer. I want to print one less than that integer, so i - 1. What's the easiest way for a noob like myself to accomplish this?
[07:32:01] <midnite> my command that outputs the integer: cat 10.sql | sqlite3 movies.db | wc -l
[07:34:42] <llua> sqlite3 movies.db < 10.sql | awk 'END { print NR-1 }'
[07:34:42] <chiselfuse> echo $(($(cat 10.sql | sqlite3 movies.db | wc -l) - 1))
[07:36:02] <chiselfuse> llua's way is better.
[07:37:35] <midnite> awesome. thanks llua :)
[07:37:42] <midnite> I was going to try something like that, chisel
[07:46:41] <pj> also note that llua fixed your UUOC as well

[10:47:06] <pj> basically put TERM=dumb is passed to echo, but $TERM on the echo command line is interpolated by bash, not echo itself, and is interpolated before echo is called.

[13:27:17] <MrPixels> what is the handler?
[13:28:03] <pj> That's a bit complex, you can just background them all and see their output in the shell, something like: service1 & service2 & ... & wait

[13:28:21] <greybot> If you put the control operator & at the end of a command, e.g. ''command args &'', the shell executes the command in the background in a subshell. The shell does not wait for the command to finish, and the return status is 0. Pid of the last backgrounded command is available via the special variable $!

[15:19:54] <FreeBDSM> hi. There is `echo a > somefile` and `echo a >| somefile` which behave differently with noclobber enabled, but what is the `>|` analog for `>>` ?
[15:20:13] <FreeBDSM> I tried the obvious `>>|`, but got error

[15:21:23] <FreeBDSM> oh, wait, the existence of it makes no sense, noclobber is just a safe guard against rewriting a file if it already exists, >> doesn't delete existing stuff, it appends

[19:13:34] <rendar> ok
[19:14:45] <rgrinberg> izabera I see. That's unfortunate. I suppose I can do printf -v to assign directly to a variable. Since I'm generating a shell script, I would have preferred to avoid this.
[19:15:57] <emanuele6> avoid printf-v?
[19:18:56] <rgrinberg> Yeah, exactly. I have a string literal written with escape codes, e.g. \x23\25\x26 that I'm interpreting with printf to generate a shell command. The end result is something like cat >"$(printf \x20..\x21)" <<EOF ...
[19:19:07] <rgrinberg> but there's quite a few lines like this being generated so I'd prefer to avoid all the forks if possible
[19:19:27] <rgrinberg> And it is possible, but requires a temporary variable.
[19:19:59] <emanuele6> if it's literal, just use $''
