[02:07:44] <Yogen88[m]> Hi, I've been searching the internet for a few days now, but I didn't find what I was looking for. Maybe someone here could help me out. What I'd like to do is have an interactive buffer where I can input text, and for every input character added a lua function would be called and it's result displayed in the buffer. I've looked at the code of nvim-fzf because it's close to what I'd like to have in nature, but it does something completely
[02:07:44] <Yogen88[m]> different using a terminal emulator and pipes. Do I need the term to have dynamic interactive input in nvim?
[02:08:11] <clason[m]> GlennOberlander[: I think it's helpful to start reading the general Lua introductions linked at the top of the guide.
[02:08:46] <clason[m]> The fact that Neovim's `init.lua` has the same name as the standard entrance point for Lua modules is an unfortunate accident.

[04:15:24] <YorickPeterse[m]> Bah, some language servers reports column numbers beyond the last column when there's a syntax error
[04:15:26] <YorickPeterse[m]> which then messes up the likes of `lafter`
[04:15:57] <mjlbach[m]> womp
[04:16:09] <mjlbach[m]> We clamped the display with line rows
[04:16:13] <mjlbach[m]> cc gpanders 
[04:16:20] <mjlbach[m]> we can do something similar for columns
[04:16:30] <mjlbach[m]> we have to store the "true" column number though
[04:16:36] <mjlbach[m]> otherwise it messes up code actions
[04:16:44] <mjlbach[m]> it's just we fake the navigation to take you to the last valid area
[04:17:44] <YorickPeterse[m]> I think this really is a language server issue
[04:18:10] <YorickPeterse[m]> Though I suspect that the usual response to such bug reports will be "yeah this is how our parser just works lol"
[04:18:27] <YorickPeterse[m]> (having written too many parsers, I understand why this happens, and it can be tricky to fix)
[04:18:57] <YorickPeterse[m]> I think the issue with clamping is that for every diagnostic you have to get the line's column count. I'm not sure that's the best thing to do when displaying many of them
[04:19:13] <YorickPeterse[m]> (not sure how webscale it is to get the column count for every line)
[04:22:56] <mjlbach[m]> well

[04:23:02] <mjlbach[m]> only the navigation

[04:46:29] <YorickPeterse[m]> Specifically, my issue is this: I get diagnostics using `vim.diagnostic.get`. Some of these use a column number greater than the line length they belong to. I then stuff these in a location list, then jump around using e.g. `lafter`
[04:46:40] <YorickPeterse[m]> Since the column number is out of bounds, `lafter` is never able to jump over it
[04:46:49] <mjlbach[m]> Oh that is different
[04:46:56] <mjlbach[m]> goto_next should handle this appropriately right?
[04:47:03] <YorickPeterse[m]> `lafter` here is correct more or less, because it expects correct/sorted line/column numbers
[04:47:14] <YorickPeterse[m]> mjlbach: let me see, since I don't use it
[04:47:43] <YorickPeterse[m]> Seems `goto_next` also gets stuck
[04:47:54] <mjlbach[m]> hm
[04:47:56] <YorickPeterse[m]> Probably same underlying issue: it keeps finding the out of bounds diagnostic as the next one
[04:48:01] <mjlbach[m]> Well
[04:48:04] <YorickPeterse[m]> because technically it is 😛
[04:48:12] <YorickPeterse[m]> (relative to the cursor at least)
[04:48:14] <mjlbach[m]> no but I thought we worked around this
[04:48:32] <mjlbach[m]> clamping the diagnostics to be within row/col buffer space only within the navigation functions
[04:49:43] <YorickPeterse[m]> The most basic repro is with lua-language-server using this:... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/b65e30d216d6417a748313da9f478642c388fcdb)
[04:49:56] <YorickPeterse[m]> If you then use `lua vim.diagnostic.goto_next({ float = false, severity = { min = vim.diagnostic.severity.WARN } })` you can't jump past `baz`
[04:50:12] <YorickPeterse[m]> If that's a legit error I'll report a bug for it 🙂
[04:51:07] <mjlbach[m]> That works for me
[04:51:09] <mjlbach[m]> hm
[04:51:16] <YorickPeterse[m]> wot
[04:51:17] <mjlbach[m]> are you sure your runtime files are up to date?
[04:51:30] <YorickPeterse[m]> well I did just install nvim from Git again, but let me try a clean install
[04:51:43] <mjlbach[m]> or you aren't overriding something
[04:51:44] <mjlbach[m]> I'm not sure
[04:51:52] <mjlbach[m]> I'm on the latest nightly and it jumps right to end
[04:52:08] <mjlbach[m]> Actually
[04:52:13] <mjlbach[m]> maybe it's our sumneko versions
[04:52:25] <mjlbach[m]> Mine reports row 2 col 1-2
[04:52:28] <mjlbach[m]> which is in range
[04:52:36] <YorickPeterse[m]> mjlbach: In my case there are 3 errors, the last one being on the `end` line. Using `goto_next` I can't jump to that one

[10:25:34] <mjlbach[m]> `require('lspconfig').cssls.setup{}`
[10:25:36] <mjlbach[m]> that's it
[10:25:44] <mjlbach[m]> put that in a heredoc if you're using an init.vim
[10:25:56] <mjlbach[m]> lua << EOF
[10:25:56] <mjlbach[m]> require('lspconfig').cssls.setup{}
[10:25:56] <mjlbach[m]> EOF
[10:26:40] <aphysically> and saw some people saying luajit was abandoned but not actually abandoned and it was all really confusing especially when as far as I could tell it was being actively updated
[10:26:41] <mjlbach[m]> so is v8 though
[10:26:41] <mjlbach[m]> aphysically: it is very fast
[10:26:47] <aphysically> but the luajit code itself was cool :^)
[10:26:49] <mjlbach[m]> its not abandoned
[10:27:03] <KOKOUAFIDEGNON[m> mjlbach: this is the part i don't understand... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/757365e7816e1919635f1b03d764c8df2a16e469)
[10:27:07] <mjlbach[m]> ignore that
[10:27:09] <mjlbach[m]> those are the defaults
[10:27:16] <mjlbach[m]> you do not have to copy the default values
[10:27:24] <KOKOUAFIDEGNON[m> where do i override them?

[10:28:00] <KOKOUAFIDEGNON[m> yes, i'm still reading
[10:28:03] <mjlbach[m]> :) 
[10:28:20] <mjlbach[m]> I could say it again, but I said it better in the manual
[10:28:40] <mjlbach[m]> most of the time you won't need to override the defaults

[13:24:03] <KOKOUAFIDEGNON[m> when launching nvim, i had to manually re-source init.vim to have some of the keys active. how do i auto-load it ?
[13:25:23] <ii14[m]> it already is loaded, fix collisions
[13:25:30] <ii14[m]> `:verbose map`
[13:25:50] <ii14[m]> and `:verbose map!`
[13:25:55] <ii14[m]> for insert mode etc
[13:26:14] <ii14[m]> something overwrites your bindings
[13:27:46] <KOKOUAFIDEGNON[m> how do i find keybinding from custom mode? i.e when loaded `css` files, the available keybinding for that context
[13:28:07] <ii14[m]> just load css file and check there
[13:28:16] <KOKOUAFIDEGNON[m> how do i check?
[13:28:22] <KOKOUAFIDEGNON[m> the same command?
[13:28:27] <Amanda[m]1> yes
[13:28:38] <ii14[m]> `:verbose map` to list all bindings for normal,visual mode
[13:28:39] <KOKOUAFIDEGNON[m> ok, thanks
[13:28:46] <ii14[m]> you can check specific mapping

[21:33:26] <kylo252[m]> <clason[m]> "there's your list :D" <- so it's really planned to move some/any more functions to `vim.api`? just gotta live with whatever overhead exists?
[21:33:34] <clason[m]> what?
[21:33:57] <clason[m]> nothing is moved from `vim.fn` to `vim.api` -- those are totally different
[21:33:58] <kylo252[m]> there's no* plan^
[21:35:24] <kylo252[m]> meaning there's no such thing as a function being in `vim.fn` and now moving into having an interface using `vim.api` instead, correct?
[21:35:30] <clason[m]> correct

[21:36:06] <clason[m]> because `vim.fn` exposes vim functions, while `vim.api` (directly) exposes the standard Neovim API
[21:36:08] <kylo252[m]> but those that don't exist in `vim.fn` should be made into `vim.api`? 
[21:36:16] <clason[m]> what? no!
[21:36:24] <clason[m]> the Neovim API is its own thing
[21:36:51] <clason[m]> new APIs can be created, and these then will be accessible through `vim.api`
[21:36:55] <kylo252[m]> so all the `vim.api` are from scratch, more or less?

[21:38:01] <clason[m]> while `vim.fn` is a metatable that exposes Vimscript functions
[21:38:03] <kylo252[m]> yeah but it's a bit muddy how all of those interact, and that API talks a lot about RPC and clients, and not much about internal functions
[21:38:09] <clason[m]> same thing
[21:38:22] <WhyNotHugo> Any hints on how I can debug LSPs crashing?
[21:38:30] <clason[m]> the API is exposed via RPC, via Vim script, and via Lua

[21:48:26] <WhyNotHugo> kylo252[m]: Kinda. I'm using the LSPs containerised rather than on my host, so not-that-minimal. I'll try and make a reproducible example.
[21:48:48] <clason[m]> well, new API functions can be added (if there's a strong enough argument -- these have a hard and expensive contract, so the bar is much higher than for simple Lua functions)
[21:49:51] <kylo252[m]> WhyNotHugo: how do you mean "containerized" ? is the RPC done over a network?
[21:50:03] <kylo252[m]> clason[m]: I see, thanks for explaining! 
[21:51:02] <WhyNotHugo> kylo252[m]: No, the container is a local container, so it's not done over the network. I'm using some helpers to that run
