[05:05:08] <pj> I didn't think that amavisd-new could do signing.
[05:05:51] <pj> oh, it can
[05:06:05] <pj> supports optional DKIM signing, with plenty of flexibility in choosing a suitable signature for multi-domain sites (author or third-party signatures); if desired, all other checks can be disabled and amavisd used as a DKIM signing service only;
[05:06:28] <pj> That said, I've always just used opendkim for signing.

[22:17:39] <Friithian> so in my cyber forensics class I am being told to read email headers from the bottom up, any opinions on that?
[22:19:19] <pj> Friithian: generally yes, but headers on the bottom can be spoofed.
[22:20:45] <Friithian> alright, I mainly ask because this class is uh, useless at teaching (they just say things and you have to figure it out)
[22:37:31] *** Quits: rgrinberg (~textual@200.5.63.76) (Quit: My MacBook has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[22:39:42] <rob0> I doubt any class on such things is very good.
[22:40:29] <rob0> Main thing to keep in mind is that you can only trust headers you can verify.
[22:50:03] <Friithian> this class specifically is useless
[22:50:14] <Friithian> welcome to <university>'s cyber security program
[22:53:07] <jimpop> it's out of date by the time you graduate.
[22:54:08] <lunaphyte> in a class like that, i'd expect the message to be that theoretically, email headers are appended from the bottom up, but it would be irresponsible, from a security perspective, to assume that is any sort of empirical absolute
[22:54:16] <Friithian> it already is out of date
[22:56:28] <Friithian> thankfully I am in the compsci program which is actually pretty goo
