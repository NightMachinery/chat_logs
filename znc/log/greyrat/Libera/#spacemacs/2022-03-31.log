[13:01:26] <FromGitter> <sochotnicky> I was playing with Emacs 28/29 and both of them have weird behaviour with spacemacs. I open an emacsclient frame (either in terminal or a gui one) and the prompts appear on the terminal where I ran the emacs daemon itself. I did some google searching but came up short. It's not that high priority since I am OK with 27.2 for the most part, but thought I'd ask if someone knows what this might be about...
