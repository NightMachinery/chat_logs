[01:48:10] <sshine> I think they should just buy stonks.
[01:49:13] <hpc> use github runners to mine bitcoin :P
[01:52:53] <monochrom> "spend it on raising some money" is how I do resource economy in RTS games >:)
[01:53:52] <kuribas> monochrom: which one?
[01:54:30] <kuribas> I just finished the campaign of Spellforce 3 soul harvest, but the RTS bit was very underwhelming.
[01:54:35] <monochrom> "this upgrade costs 500 stone and enables gaining 125 stone each time you destroy an enemy building" yes god yes!
[01:55:17] <monochrom> Currently it's AOE4 but really any RTS game I play ranging from AOE2-4 to C&C3/RedAlert3
[01:55:26] <kuribas> usually it's more like, this upgrade gives you 0.05 more stones!
[01:55:45] <kuribas> These days I prefer turn based strategy.
[01:56:34] <kuribas> Or at least RT with pausing, like pillars of eternity.
[01:56:45] <kuribas> RTS tend to be just click as fast as possible.
[01:57:00] <kuribas> With turn based I can make strategies all over the map.
[01:57:28] <monochrom> Yeah I'm actually bad at action-per-minute and multitasking, so in theory turn-based works better for me. In practice though, all turn-based 4X are too complex or complicated (can't tell the difference any more), old-style RTS is ironically very playable for me.
[01:59:45] <kuribas> I found for most games it's a matter of finding the right playstyle.
[02:00:14] <monochrom> When I was playing SimCity 2000 or 3000 (I forgot), I accepted neighbouring cities's contracts of getting paid for "take their trash, give them water, give them electricity". I then used the income to build more trashing-taking, water-pumping, electrifying facilities so they could upgrade their contracts so the whole thing just snowballed.
[02:00:48] <kuribas> In age of wonders, it's mostly about leveraging your heroes to stomp over weak enemies, and being very aggressive.
[02:01:01] <monochrom> My city therefore was basically like very low population but the income went off the roof and my people enjoyed free subway and everything.
[02:02:18] <kuribas> yeah, those games give you more freedom in play style.
[02:03:01] <kuribas> I have alpha centauri in my library, but still need to play it.
[02:03:08] <kuribas> It's supposed to be one of the best.
[02:03:14] <monochrom> And of course, the number of futuristic power plants (orbital solar-powered beam-downs) and recycling plants also went off the roof, compared to the merely 10000 population haha.
[02:05:41] <kuribas> makes sense to fewer, but happy people.
[02:05:59] <kuribas> Our current world seems to be made for maximizing quantity of people, but most of the suffering.
[02:06:26] <abastro[m]> So, old simcity had those?
[02:06:43] <geekosaur> quantity of people tends to maximize itself
[02:06:50] <abastro[m]> Why is newer simcity so... uh
[02:07:35] <geekosaur> Mar 22 00:42:10 <geekosaur>	(population simulator, run with bounds disabled. can you say "exponential growth", kids?)
[02:07:51] <abastro[m]> Newer simcities are quite lame I recall
[02:08:02] <kuribas> I never played simcity...
[02:08:18] <kuribas> There was a newer space city game, but it was too boring.
[02:08:28] <abastro[m]> Space city game?
[02:10:03] <kuribas> ah, aven colony.
[02:10:14] <kuribas> it did everything "right", but I found it just so boring.

[02:16:40] <kuribas> is it good?

[02:17:20] <hpc> i keep forgetting to buy it
[02:17:34] <monochrom> Is Before We Leave the newer space city game you have in mind?
[02:17:40] <hpc> the water sim is nice
[02:17:48] <hpc> the traffic sim isn't embarassingly stupid
[02:20:54] <kuribas> monochrom: no, it was "Aven Colony".  But I don't recommend it.
[02:21:22] <kuribas> I read "Surviving Mars" is quite good.
[02:21:41] <abastro[m]> Surviving Mars is playable, idk if it is good tho
[02:21:47] <abastro[m]> It is like, crazy expensive
[02:21:58] <abastro[m]> For the experience it offers, I recall
[02:22:10] <kuribas> abastro[m]: wait, you buy games full price? :-O
[02:22:17] <abastro[m]> Did provide some fun tho
[02:22:28] <abastro[m]> Oh, I mean even at sale
[02:22:47] <abastro[m]> Idk, maybe I just got abt 20% sale on that one
[02:23:22] <kuribas> $8.20 currently for the base game (without expansions).
[02:23:31] <kuribas> Pretty cheap I'd say.
[02:24:03] <kuribas> https://www.gog.com/game/surviving_mars
[02:24:58] <kuribas> Even the full price, 32$ isn't much for a commercial game IMO..
[02:25:53] <kuribas> abastro[m]: some advice, buy games when they are a few years out, then they usually come at 75% discounts :)
[02:26:32] <janus> i just got Cities: Skylines for free one the epic store
[02:26:51] <hpc> except for factorio, that never goes on sale so buy it asap :P

[02:30:33] <abastro[m]> And.. ended up buying much more expensive

[12:39:09] <abastro> So now I am on IRC, but how do I..
[12:39:15] <abastro> 1. Split the window to left & right
[12:39:51] <abastro> 2. Can I view chat history?
[12:42:32] <parsnip> IRC doesn't really provide history. users manage that themselves, in various ways.
[12:43:02] <parsnip> splitting a window is a feature of the IRC client you choose.
[12:45:14] *** Joins: Midjak (~Midjak@82.66.147.146)
[12:46:02] <abastro> Oh, I guess chat history needs something which stays online
[12:46:32] <abastro> I am so dumb that I did not specify which client :<
[12:46:50] <abastro> I was recommended \glirc.
[12:47:58] <abastro> Its minimalism is certainly nice, but I'd like 1. windows split vertically 2. \glirc ran as a separate app rather than as terminal
[12:53:38] <parsnip> oh, glirc is pretty cool
[12:53:50] <parsnip> hexchat i think is a popular irc client
[12:53:52] <[exa]> abastro: this is IRC, which is very realistic, so like with real chat you have no history and no way to split people into windows :D
[12:54:05] <parsnip> a lot of people prefer irc in terminal
[12:54:25] <parsnip> weechat is another popular terminal irc client
[12:55:00] *** Joins: eggplantade (~Eggplanta@108-201-191-115.lightspeed.sntcca.sbcglobal.net)
[12:55:07] <[exa]> abastro: if you want history, the easiest way is to run some terminal client permanently on a tiny server, login through ssh, and let it log traffic to files (I've got tmux+irssi running that way)
[12:55:22] <parsnip> glirc probably has split windows
[12:56:15] <abastro> Interesting!
[12:56:21] <abastro> \glirc does have split windows
[12:56:34] <abastro> However.. it splits into up & down
[12:56:42] <abastro> left & right would be more preferable
[12:57:02] <abastro> The bigger culprit to me is, though, it is displayed as a terminal
[12:58:34] <parsnip> many GUI IRC users seem to use hexchat
[12:58:47] <parsnip> i prefer terminal actually
[12:59:03] <abastro> I mean, I don't prefer GUI

[13:52:59] <abastro[m]> How do I do that?
[13:54:15] <tdammers> depends on which terminal you use, but most support passing a command line as an argument
[13:54:48] <tdammers> e.g., for running vim in a new urxvt terminal, I use this command: urxvt -e vim $@
[13:55:16] *** Joins: kuribas (~user@ip-188-118-57-242.reverse.destiny.be)
[13:55:26] <tdammers> put that in a script file, with a suitable hashbang (#!/bin/sh at the top), make it executable, and you can launch it like a program
[13:55:35] <tdammers> (like a GUI program, that is)
[13:55:55] <tdammers> you can pull the same trick with pretty much any other terminal emulator

[17:16:40] <jpds> abastro[m]: It gets the job done, and is easy to learn/use
[17:16:50] <parsnip> actually, it's also, "what can i do with this language in the near future"
[17:17:39] <parsnip> can i reframe your statement as, people like modern languages?
[17:18:04] <jpds> abastro[m]: There's also a significant portion of the "cloud native" ecosystem that's written in Go: Docker/Kubernetes/Prometheus/Istio/etc/...
[17:18:11] <parsnip> or do you also mean, "why do people like imperative and OOP, instead of functional and ML"
[17:18:20] <river> parsnip: C if you learn rust, C should be fairly easy :P
[17:18:53] <parsnip> i'd like to learn a little Rust, i have a little more motivation for that
[17:20:09] <parsnip> Rust looks a little modern/easier, and i've seen it coming up in areas i already have an interest in

[17:25:37] <abastro[m]> Oh.
[17:25:41] <abastro[m]> I mean, yea
[17:25:51] <kuribas> isn't the goal of go to be a simple but well defined language?
[17:25:51] <abastro[m]> Hmm
[17:25:56] <kuribas> unlike python/php/...
[17:26:13] <abastro[m]> I see, perhaps that is the reason why ppl likes Go
[17:26:28] <parsnip> Go is C with memory safety? i thought that's what Rust is
[17:26:37] <jpds> parsnip: It's C without malloc
[17:26:45] <kuribas> memory safety, no nasty surprises, simplicity.
[17:27:11] <river> I suppose go has dynamic memory safety, whereas rust has static memory safety
[17:27:31] <river> to some extent, obviously it's not that clear cut in all situations (e.g. array bounds checking is going to be dynamic in both)
[17:27:46] <jpds> abastro[m]: As I said before, people like it because it enables them to get stuff done
[17:29:45] <abastro[m]> Surprising that you guys like go
[17:29:53] <abastro[m]> Hm actually I was just feeling bad that
[17:30:04] <abastro[m]> They think rust is going to die while go is going great
[17:30:23] <abastro[m]> But eh, that's too picky for me I guess. Like with that, everyone has their thoughts
[17:31:40] <river> i think they have very different domains, and rust will thrive in its domain
[17:31:53] <river> its too effective a tool to not be taken advantage of
[17:32:38] <abastro[m]> Hmm
[17:33:05] <abastro[m]> Yea perhaps the company which dropped it (as I heard due to maintenance issues) were simply doing common backend tasks
[17:33:34] <juri_> so, i recently went through an external technical audit at $dayjob
[17:33:49] <parsnip> backend? isn't Go more of a backend language than Rust?
[17:34:04] <juri_> the biggest weakness they had to tell us was that haskell developers are rare, and we must be having problems hiring..
[17:34:31] <juri_> meanwhile, we can hire haskellers of good to great quality ALL DAY... but can't hire operations people to save our lives.
[17:35:09] <geekosaur> (argh)
[17:35:16] <abastro> Yep, so because Go is more fit for typical backend compared to rust
[17:35:18] <parsnip> maybe it was a scam
[17:35:29] <parsnip> like, they might have a line on some recruiting group
[17:35:52] <abastro> That might be the reason why they switched to Go
[17:35:53] <juri_> could be. they were picked by our investors.
[17:35:58] <parsnip> and Haskell obstructs them from placing from their list
[17:36:37] <abastro> Ouch
[17:37:12] <juri_> and since this is offtopic.. anyone have good operators to recommend? :P
[17:37:33] <juri_> we're full up on haskellers, sadly.
[17:37:56] <juri_> 12 is all i can support.
[17:40:44] <abastro> <del>So that's why, haskellers are too capable that ppl on their line struggle to be hidden</del>

[19:32:14] <tdammers> for most companies, developers are an extremely scarce and valuable resource, while infrastructure is a commodity. but when you run at google scale, just throwing more hardware at it is no longer the solution to all your problems, and the kind of hardware you need is no longer a commodity

[20:08:24] <Lycurgus> well there's a steep drop off from btc to various trash coin which is basically all of them except btc and eth
[20:09:37] <Lycurgus> there just isnt a place for more than one or two moneys catering to the underside of the global economy
[20:12:21] <Lycurgus> crypto is a bubble which will lead to something like globally accepted distributed ledgers for SWIFT or the like after it is worked into the mainstream

[20:22:50] <Lycurgus> also the way it was successfully dealt with technically was entirely new
[20:23:24] <Lycurgus> it's almost hard to remember that before 2020 viral vaccine development was something that was expected to take decades 
[20:24:00] <Lycurgus> but the lack of a sense of proportion and what not is the real story
[20:24:12] <geekosaur> it was kinda a perfect storm, technically
[20:24:55] <tdammers> you'd think that a global pandemic would have ended the anti-vaxx nonsense, not amplified it by several orders of magnitude
[20:25:26] <Lycurgus> well there's anti-vax and anti-vax
[20:25:38] <Lycurgus> the hysteria doesn't make any distinctions
[20:25:45] <tdammers> yeah
[20:26:04] <Lycurgus> people with natural immunity don't benefit much, only marginally from vaccination
[20:26:22] <Lycurgus> i was infected in feb '20
[20:26:42] <tdammers> right, but that's not the "argument" that baffled me so much
[20:27:05] <Lycurgus> i'd get a vaccine if that hadn't been the case but see no reason to as I believe I've also been exposed since, and just didn experience any symptons at all
[20:27:44] <tdammers> I guess what hit me the hardest about the whole covid situation, mentally speaking, was how obviously visible it made the widespread asshole culture that has been permeating society for the past couple decades
[20:27:55] <Lycurgus> there is fairly late in the game and if you look for it an acknowledgement that natural immunity from exposure is superior to vaccination
[20:28:32] <tdammers> and, yeah, sure, an actual infection works about as well, if not better, than a vaccine
[20:28:37] <Lycurgus> yes this decades is turning out to be asshole reveals for the ages
[20:28:45] <Lycurgus> case in point: russia
[20:28:54] <tdammers> oh boy, yeah
[20:29:06] <tdammers> and also the social media effect
[20:29:32] <Lycurgus> the old reality really ended with trump
[20:30:15] <Lycurgus> who would have thought when the classic nuclear war scenario actually happened it would sort be ho hummed, so what else is new
[20:31:06] <tdammers> if you ask me, it ended with Reagan
[20:31:10] <Lycurgus> you'd have to have first contact to really get people's attention at this point
[20:32:56] <tdammers> but, I mean, we're welcoming Ukrainian refugees with open arms, like family, and we toss aside a bunch of laws and regulations and what not to make their lives as easy as we can, and that's great, but meanwhile, look at how we've been treating refugees from literally anywhere else over the past decades (and we still do - in fact, we're kicking out non-Ukrainian refugees at an accelerated
[20:32:58] <tdammers> pace, or overloading refugee centers to 200% capacity, just to make room for the Ukrainians)
[20:34:54] <Lycurgus> i'm good with that
[20:36:11] <Lycurgus> in general I think you have to temper the welcoming of refugees with sending them back to the places from which they bear some collective responsibility
[20:36:54] <monochrom> Ugh can't agree getting infected is better than vaccination. Infection comes with the risk of suffering much sickness, dying quickly, and if you don't, risk of much weakened lung and neural system for the rest of your life. And the certainty that you infect others while you're at it.
[20:37:20] <Lycurgus> well it was a strong flu/cold
[20:38:06] <Lycurgus> the actual infected fatality rate is about same as other viruses in the category, 1-@% at the very high end
[20:38:12] <Lycurgus> *1-2
[20:38:14] <monochrom> So this is the me-culture (of which the asshole culture is just a special case). "I got infected, I was lucky to come out alright, therefore for everyone natural immunity is superior to vaccination"
[20:38:22] <Lycurgus> fractional in most studies I've seen
[20:38:53] <Lycurgus> the reverse of that

[20:44:47] <Lycurgus> natural plus a vaccine is highest protection but only marginally better than full spectrum natural
[20:45:55] <tdammers> right, but the whopping advantage of a vaccine is that it won't make you as sick, and is extremely unlikely to kill you
[20:45:56] <Lycurgus> ideal would be to get a very low load natural exposure and the best vaccine
[20:46:41] <Lycurgus> i imagine low load exposure could be engineered so as to be safe for anyone
[20:47:07] <Lycurgus> the common natural exposure is a huge load though
[20:47:10] <tdammers> that would amount to a vaccine, no?
[20:47:16] <Lycurgus> some more than others
[20:47:29] <Lycurgus> no it would be better than a vaccine

[20:48:09] <geekosaur> well, better than the current vacines, which are just a spike protein instead of an inactivated or low load of the full virus
[20:48:12] <Lycurgus> they're very narrowly targetted to specific surface proteins
[20:48:14] <monochrom> I understand that the natural part means the most updated variants right away without waiting for labs to develop vaccines.
[20:48:46] <geekosaur> but there are vaccines for other viruses which are inactivated full viruses instead of just selected proteins
[20:48:55] <tdammers> it would literally be a type of vaccine. the current covid vaccines are different types, but some vaccines for other diseases work pretty much like this, using real virus or bacterial material, nerfed down to harmless levels.

[21:00:59] <julm> there's a wikipedia page about that https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV_vaccine_development
[21:01:09] <[exa]> no, it's not useless-- covid doesn't destroy the T cells _primarily_, and in the end you win with probabilities
[21:01:49] <Lycurgus> i don't think covid target t cells at all does it, at least specifically
[21:02:20] <Lycurgus> hiv only targets cd4 cells and macrophages, a few other lesser lines
[21:02:23] <[exa]> not specifically but there are reports where it successfully enters these, I might find papers
[21:02:24] <geekosaur> unclear at present
[21:02:37] <[exa]> there's also the T cell exhaustion problem which is even uglier
[21:02:38] <geekosaur> what [exa] said basically
[21:02:42] <Lycurgus> and really only cd4 for the most part
[21:03:55] <[exa]> and yeah, the probabilities for HIV are much in favor of HIV, you basically need to ensure that the memory cells manage to deliver some signals/antigens to the rest of the mess until they get wiped out
[21:04:11] <Lycurgus> the majority of organisms or suborganims that are commensural with an animal are harmless or beneficial
[21:04:37] <Lycurgus> it's pretty basic to life
[21:05:06] <[exa]> in turn, there aren't many other "kinds" of cells (especially not B's) that could do anything with it; HIV vaccine afaik just dodges this somehow
[21:05:35] <Lycurgus> i don't believe there's a working hiv vaccine
[21:06:27] <Lycurgus> ok the lede to the wiki article says there are two candidates
[21:06:45] <Lycurgus> but this is a perfect illustration of what were alluding to earlier
[21:07:21] <Lycurgus> there's a segment of the population that due to a mutation in the CD4 receptor are immune to hiv
[21:07:52] <Lycurgus> the gene allele is called ccr4 or 6, i forget which
[21:09:22] <Lycurgus> it's easily the case that a larger complex of genes could be boosted by a vaccine 
[21:09:58] <Lycurgus> which would still be short of the kind of thing people expect, e.g. as in the polio or other vaccines
[21:10:54] <Lycurgus> covid is apparently like that but in reverse
[21:11:01] <geekosaur> hiv doesn't"dodge" B cells afaik; they're the sentinels. sadly they call out macrophages and CD4+ T cells
[21:11:17] <geekosaur> which promptly get infected instead of eradicating the virus
[21:11:34] <Lycurgus> only a tiny minority have the ccr allele but apparently the vast majority of people have the genetics to resist covid
[21:12:13] <Lycurgus> b cells are not targets of hiv but ofc they still have their normal role in immunity
[21:13:13] <[exa]> Lycurgus: tbh the immune segment of population is 1 hiv mutation away from not being immune anymore
[21:13:33] <[exa]> B cells are needed to produce the shitloads of antibodies that actually allow the rest of the system to do something sensible
[21:14:15] <Lycurgus> well yeah, but hiv wouldn't be hiv without it's relation to cd4
[21:14:53] <[exa]> yep
[21:15:10] <Lycurgus> in people who have treated hiv, and their t cells are normal, they still have inverted cd4/cd8 ratios
[21:15:51] <Lycurgus> which is actually a good thing, probably the basis for a number of observed reduced risks for people with long term treated hiv
[21:16:19] <Lycurgus> their killer/cytotoxic t cell populations are 2-3X normal
