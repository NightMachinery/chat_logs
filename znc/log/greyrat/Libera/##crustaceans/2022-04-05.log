[01:01:57] <buttsbot> Twatter - kenklippenstein - Amazon to ban the word "union" on its new worker chat app, per internal company documents leaked to me.   Other banned ...
[01:04:58] <epilys> unionated states of amazonica
[01:06:43] <defect> some poor dba getting fired for suggesting union selects
[01:12:36] <ngoldbaum> saw a baby great horned owl in a nest with mama
[01:12:42] <ngoldbaum> was extremely cute
[01:14:27] <kronk> which worker chat app is that, again?
[01:14:32] <kronk> we only have chime as far as I know.

[01:24:49] <epilys> kronk, says "new", the suits probably are going to surprise you?
[01:27:44] <kronk> we have slack.. I don't know where this is sourcing its info from.
[01:27:47] <kronk> slack and chime.
[01:28:03] <kronk> there's no other efforts that I'm aware of.
[01:28:57] <epilys> maybe it's for the lower pay folk :/
[01:29:14] <kronk> that'd be a redundant engineering effort.
[01:29:22] <kronk> but.. probably.
[01:29:35] <epilys> aren't they paying millions on antiunion consultants already or sth?
[01:30:29] <kronk> probably.. the higher pay folks got together and started posting salary transparency reports.
[01:30:58] <kronk> some day I won't work for this company.
[01:32:34] <epilys> someday no one will

[17:36:02] <Xe> which bouncer program?
[17:36:08] <gwozniak> ZNC
[17:36:15] <Xe> yeah ZNC is shit
[17:36:40] <gwozniak> Not going to argue with that
[17:43:08] <gerikson> ZNC is obtuse even by open source standards
[17:46:20] <gwozniak> Once I got disconnected I couldn't even login via IRC, but the web interface did
[17:47:29] <gwozniak> So I wiped out the Droplet I had on DigitalOcean and deactivated my account.  So much for that experiment.
[18:05:57] <Brekkjern> Quassel works rather well for me
[18:06:16] <Brekkjern> If you want suggestions on alternatives
[18:07:13] <companion_cube> there's emersion's bouncer, too
[18:07:38] <companion_cube> https://git.sr.ht/~emersion/soju not sure how good it is
[18:07:39] <buttsbot> ~emersion/soju - sourcehut git
[18:08:09] <gwozniak> If I ever care enough to try again, I may set one up, but honestly, the benefits seem pretty minimal
[18:09:47] <gwozniak> Plus, I don't have any server maintenance since I moved my web hosting to use Fastmail and I kind of appreciate that
[18:15:47] <indigo> The lounge is nice
[18:15:56] <gerikson> I am happy using tmux in a droplet
[18:16:13] <gerikson> ZNC *could* be used for mobile access but it's clunky AF
[18:16:45] <gwozniak> I don't do anything from mobile, so the benefits for me are basically nil
[18:17:19] <gwozniak> I got some referral credit on DO from a friend so I thought I'd give it a try
[18:23:00] <gerikson> I like DO
[18:23:08] <gerikson> been rock-solid for me
[18:25:11] <gwozniak> I have nothing against DO.  I just don't need it now.
[18:25:44] <gwozniak> It was easy enough to set up a Droplet and all that
[18:26:44] <companion_cube> there's this new thing : https://www.pikapods.com/ which has thelounge among other things
[18:26:44] <buttsbot> PikaPods - Instant Open Source App Hosting
[18:26:56] <companion_cube> haven't tried it but it's the team behind borgbase

[22:00:06] <companion_cube> anyway, I discovered "%ms" while looking at the solution might be

[22:00:29] <companion_cube> %s, but it mallocs for you
[22:00:37] <companion_cube> so, I guess, no buffer overflow
[22:01:11] <martian67> ah
[22:04:41] <kronk> format strings that trigger memory allocations... man do I love C.
[22:04:53] <companion_cube> better than just overflowing no? :)
[22:04:57] <kronk> yeah, but jesus.
[22:05:47] <companion_cube> in scanf it doesn't shock me, tbh
[22:06:05] <companion_cube> idk what the reasonable alternative would be
[22:06:20] <gwozniak> the printf family can malloc behind the scenes (and probably does)
[22:06:22] <companion_cube> (aside from "pretend it's 1980 and limit input to 256 chars", like IRC does)
[22:07:09] <gwozniak> We had to change the implementation to not do that for our library version
[22:17:05] <kronk> so twitter is dead. musk's joining the BoD.
[22:17:15] <edk> printf doesn't need to malloc unless it supports the n$ stuff
[22:26:21] <gerikson> kronk: I foresee many moments of hilarity
