[01:16:18] <ProfSimm> Decker: I have this mental model that all fractional math should be essentially scaled integers from -1 to 1
[01:16:20] <ProfSimm> or 0 to 1

[01:17:03] <ProfSimm> Decker: what about  integer + integer/max_integer
[01:17:18] <Decker> right - that's the same as scaled integer
[01:17:19] <dude12312414> use bigint pairs for numerator and denominator, keep them coprime for a reduced representation

[01:19:05] <ProfSimm> Floating points are however useful because they scale non-linearly and can represent rather large or small values
[01:19:20] <ProfSimm> Can we simulate this with scaled ints by mapping them non-linearly
[01:19:30] <Decker> yes; at the cost that over a mangissa of N you can't just add 1 - or subtract 1 in the case of -n

[01:33:35] <Guest1778> okay basic question. Why does a point (a1, ..., an) define an affine variety? In the polynomial ring k[x1, x2, ...., xn] the text I have says we can write V(x1 - a1, ..., , xn - an). But aren't the x's the coordinates of our space? I thought we had to write a polynomial which vanishes on (a1, ..., an). So like f(a) = 0.
[01:35:35] <ProfSimm> Decker: do you sometimes imagine what it'd be like if we could take our current transistor hardware and start over with software from scratch. Nothing permitted not even C. And we add some sort of tax on how much energy and space software takes to run
[01:37:30] <Decker> ProfSimm the lsat part would still be good :)  but lots have over the time, and will again tomorrow... they all sort of end up in the same place - not nessecarily because of interop requirements with existing things...

[04:32:00] <isekaijin> MadLamb: That's nowhere near enough information to solve your problem.
[04:33:47] <isekaijin> Even if you rephrased your question as “What's the probability that two random people live in addresses consisting of the same street name and number?”, you would've still not provided enough information to answer it.
[04:34:29] <isekaijin> Errr, rephrase it as “What's the probability that the addresses of two random people have the same street name and number?”
[04:35:16] <isekaijin> For one, you need to know how many streets / roads have shared names.

[04:39:00] <PlanckWalk> At one extreme, the city could have a residential area that consists of nothing but one huge arcology.
[04:39:05] <PlanckWalk> Then the chance coudl be near 1
[04:39:32] <PlanckWalk> At the other it might consist of nothing but single-person dwellings and the chance would be zero.
[04:39:42] <PlanckWalk> (Each with their own street number)
[04:41:01] <MadLamb> isekaijin, its not so much about the name itself, but about two people being neighbours

[08:48:39] <zeroc00l0> derive a contradiction by demonstrating that it is not the case that it belongs to itself and also that it is not the case that it doesn't belong to itself. So by RAA, there is no set of all sets.

[09:05:38] <PlanckWalk> zeroc00l0: It doesn't *quite* prove that there's no set of all sets.
[09:06:01] <PlanckWalk> It just means that it's incompatible with some other axioms.
[09:07:32] <zeroc00l0> Okay.  In the particular formal system in which the proof is constructed, the proposition of the existence of a set of all sets is an antitheorem?

[09:08:04] <evoxo> So I'm given the following questions: What is the image, nullspace and a basis for the nullspace for this linear transformation: https://i.ibb.co/qsft0fJ/aa.png . Been battling with it for a while now but not sure if I'm on the right path to solve it.
[09:08:07] <zeroc00l0> Because you're right, the proof depends on certain conditions (eg, the axioms).

[09:15:33] <evoxo> greenbagels Well yea. So basically, if I got this right, the image of T is the set of Tv, where v \in C^4 right?
[09:15:45] <greenbagels> yes
[09:15:58] <evoxo> Now I will be stating some obvious things just to be sure I don't miss anything.
[09:17:23] <orbisvicis> in newton's method why is it recommended to use gaussian elimination rather than inverting the jacobian? It makes me think I'm doing it wrong by evaluating the jacobian at a point before inverting. Or is this recommendation for 4x4+ matrices?
[09:17:35] <evoxo> greenbagels Does that mean that for any vector z \in C^4, I need to have z_1 = z_1 + iz_2 - z_3 - iz_4 and z_2 = z_2 - z_3?

[09:56:45] <PlanckWalk> The image is extremely easy to find.
[09:57:08] <evoxo> That's the part I'm stuck actually.
[09:57:57] <PlanckWalk> Well, being a linear transformation it has to be some subspace of C^2 (including C^2 itself)

[10:00:31] <evoxo> PlanckWalk Yea, so far so good. Also if I'm not mistaken, the image of T is basically the span{ T(v_1), ..., T(v_n)} for some v \in C^4 right?
[10:00:51] <evoxo> I don't know why I stuck on this problem for so long.
[10:00:58] *** Quits: pavonia (~user@user/siracusa) (Quit: Bye!)
[10:01:58] <PlanckWalk> If v is any basis for C^4 that works

[10:04:59] <evoxo> So if I'm not wrong, a vector v \in C^4 should satisfy v_1 = v_1 + iv_2 - v_3 - iv_4, v_2 = v_2 - v_3, right?

[10:07:03] <evoxo> Ah yes you right.
[10:07:07] <PlanckWalk> (Your equations would have been T(v) = v)
[10:07:32] <PlanckWalk> except ... not even that really since the RHS needs to be a "chopped off" v
[10:08:00] <PlanckWalk> Are there any (w_1, w_2) you can't make?
[10:08:36] <evoxo> Well, should I try to see if I can find a non trivial solution to the system above?
[10:09:11] <PlanckWalk> Sure ... though there are very easy shortcuts here
[10:09:22] <cheater> hi
[10:09:23] <PlanckWalk> Like, v_1 only appears in the equation for w_1, not in w_2
[10:09:34] <evoxo> Wait, I can't make a complex number of the for a + ib for w_2 right?
[10:09:34] <cheater> i have a problem i'd like to solve but i'm not sure how to describe it
[10:09:41] <PlanckWalk> So whatever you get for w_2, you can choose some suitable v_1 to get whatever you want for w_1
[10:10:16] <cheater> i think it has to do with differential equations, but not sure.
[10:12:06] <evoxo> PlanckWalk So what I'm really looking for here is a basis that will generate Im(T) right?
[10:12:44] <PlanckWalk> You don't even need that in this case
[10:12:47] <evoxo> "So whatever you get for w_2, you can choose some suitable v_1 to get whatever you want for w_1" what does that really imply?

[10:12:51] <PlanckWalk> But in general it woudl be nice
[10:13:06] <PlanckWalk> evoxo: It means that w_1 is completely free
[10:13:22] <PlanckWalk> And a quick inspection for w_2 shows that it is, too.
[10:13:29] <evoxo> And so is z4 right?
[10:13:38] <evoxo> w_4*
[10:13:53] <PlanckWalk> Since both w_1 and w_2 are completely free, then Im(T) = C^2
[10:15:05] <PlanckWalk> But you can work through matrix operations to get the same result.

[10:19:07] <evoxo> I'm not 100% sure I follow the above reasoning, how is w_1 and w_2 free really. Is it because there is no constraint on w_1 and w_2?
[10:20:35] <evoxo> Suppose it mapped to C^3 instead and had a third row with the value 0. That puts a constraint on w_3 = 0 and also a constraint on w_2 right? So the only free vector would be w_1.

[10:47:11] <greenbagels> if there was an extra row that was just 0, it would give you no more info

[16:15:34] <isekaijin> The correct intuition is that multiplication doesn't have to be commutative anyway. We already have (square) matrices, which can be identified with linear operators, and then matrix multiplication is operator composition.
[16:16:34] <isekaijin> But I guess it can be confusing if you use juxtaposition for both ordinary multiplication (not in the operator ring) and operator composition, in the same formula.

[17:09:05] <alphamule> That's the other direction, yeah.
[17:10:22] <alphamule> It's convenient if you already had to group complex components
[17:13:08] <isekaijin> I TA a course on series and transforms, and one major theme in the course is that complex exponentials make calculations a lot easier than trigonometric functions. Good students should have already suspected it in the preceding Calc 4 course, where Fourier series had this awkward a0 term outside of the main sum.

[17:29:17] <MysteriousSilve4> Hello! i'm trying to factorize `x^2 - 27x + 182` -- how would one find two numbers whose sum is 27 and product 182?
[17:29:50] <Svitkona> probably quicker to just complete the square
[17:29:52] <alphamule> You trying to do the method where you find factors of 27?
[17:30:12] <MysteriousSilve4> alphamule: yeah
[17:30:19] <alphamule> Yeah, there's several easy methods.  Complete [the] square, quadratic formula
[17:30:24] <alphamule> So...
[17:30:37] <alphamule> List paired factors of 27
[17:30:42] <MysteriousSilve4> the question specifies to use the factorisation method
[17:30:55] <alphamule> 1,27  3,9
[17:31:01] <alphamule> Derp
[17:31:05] <alphamule> Sorry, been a while
[17:31:12] <alphamule> Factoring the wrong term
[17:31:16] <alphamule> Factor last one
[17:31:27] <alphamule> You want to find two factors with a difference of 27
[17:31:28] <Svitkona> are you allowed to use a calculator?
[17:31:33] <alphamule> Then change sign to match
[17:31:38] <MysteriousSilve4> the factors of `c` are to be found, right?
[17:31:51] <alphamule> Like, 91*2 -> 89 difference

[17:34:05] <MysteriousSilve4> np, should i list all the factors of c and check the differences?
[17:34:06] <Svitkona> you can complete the square, find the two factors you want, then pretend you solved it by factorising 182
[17:34:16] <alphamule> Now... if you were using a graphing calculator, there's an intersection where a-b = -27
[17:34:28] <MysteriousSilve4> was wondering if there was another way
[17:34:54] <alphamule> (This is in fact same as completing the square or using the quadratic formula)
[17:34:57] <MysteriousSilve4> Svitkona: that would suffice
[17:35:08] <alphamule> Just a numerical approach
[17:35:24] <alphamule> Svitkona is not being sarcastic
[17:35:26] <alphamule> :D
[17:35:42] <alphamule> They probably just want you to (at first, early on) list the paired factors
[17:35:54] <alphamule> Then differences and sums
[17:36:03] <MysteriousSilve4> :D
[17:36:03] <MysteriousSilve4> thanks guys!
[17:36:11] <alphamule> Easy enough but tedious to make that table
[17:36:49] <alphamule> Nice thing about that table is it gives you ALL the values b could be with those conditions

[20:45:08] <cuppajoeman> PlanckWalk: I'm still stuck on the question we were discussing two days ago about f(n) = n, So where I'm at right now is that f(k) = k + a, and then we get this chain f(k) > f(f(k-1)) > f(f( [ f(k-1)  -1 ] )) > ... or if we define a_0 = k , and a_(n+1) = f(a_n - 1), then it's f(a_(n+1)) > f(a_n) for n in N+, I'm having trouble seeing how it would lead to a contradiction since f(f(k-1)) = k - 1 and f(f( [ f(k-1) - 1 ])) = k-2
[20:45:08] <cuppajoeman> (since there in that first part of it where f(n) =n ). I feel like the contradiction is going to come about somehow out of the fact that f(k) = k+a and so this chain should at most have length k+a, and that the chain looks like f( ... ) > f( ... ) > f( ... ) > ... and so I believe the values inside the f( ... ) have to be unique, and then we have to use the pigeon hole principle somehow. Could you guide me a little bit?

[20:58:11] <rsonx> A processor has 64 registers and uses 16-bit instruction format. It has two types of instructions: I-type and R-type. Each I-type instruction contains an opcode, a register name, and a 4-bit immediate value. Each R-type instruction contains an opcode and two register names. If there are 8 distinct I-type opcodes, then what is the maximum number of distinct R-type opcodes.
[20:58:50] <alphamule> It depends on how many bits you have left over...
[20:59:34] <alphamule> So you get a range for one type, then a different range for the other
[20:59:43] <alphamule> Then you break them down further based on the leftover bits
[21:00:05] <alphamule> So, start with unallocated 0-65535 entries...

[21:12:42] <alphamule> Like:  Break into halves or 8ths or 4ths at a give node
[21:13:27] <alphamule> You could have used the bitmask method, as well.
[21:13:49] <alphamule> You write the highest and lowest possible values for a range.  Others are reserved
[21:13:53] <mycroftiv> can we make the trees a forest, and connect them at the roots in a kind of symmetrical way, but not all identical?
[21:14:05] <alphamule> Allocate the remaining space until exhausted
[21:14:24] <mycroftiv> thats maybe a bit more organic than mathematical, but sufficient complexity, you get something where the metaphors and the reality have a certain convergence
[21:14:26] <alphamule> I.... guess?  :P
[21:14:38] <rsonx> are you telling about bitmask method?
[21:15:12] <mycroftiv> im just thinking of the binary hypercube and how you can see it as infinite binary trees, but symmetrical, and you can relabel each node of the graph according to taking any given node as root
[21:15:14] <alphamule> The idea behind a bitmask is you know that past a certain value for given bits, you are not using the space yet.
[21:15:33] * alphamule tries to be least confusing

[21:49:02] <tusko> When one talks about distribution theory (e.g. works of Cauchy, Sobolev. Dieudonnè. etc.), in simplest terms please I'm not very intelligent, vis-a-vis set-theoretic, infinitesimal arguments, is this boundary related to uncertainty, error, measurement, etc?
[21:49:45] <tusko> Like is distribution theory somehow challenging the idea that everything may be understood through set theory and infinitesimal arguments.
[21:49:48] <rsonx> it seems likea a concept of ip subnetting.

[21:50:44] <isekaijin> tusko: Distribution theory can be grounded just fine in the conventional foundation of mathematics.
[21:51:20] <tusko> Ok, fine. Then what is so special about the Dirac delta function?
[21:51:45] <isekaijin> The only “issue” with the Dirac delta “function” (which isn't an issue at all) is the fact that it isn't an actual function.
[21:51:51] <isekaijin> It is... well... a distribution.

[21:52:21] <tusko> As I'm reading the literature it seems as though authors are presenting distribution theory as something special, that was maybe controversial

[21:53:05] <isekaijin> So physicists and engineers were using these Dirac deltas (in fact, even before Dirac... Heaviside used them!) before mathematicians had a formal definition.

[21:57:59] <isekaijin> Yes, and that wouldn't have been much of a trouble at any earlier time in history, but roughly at that time mathematicians were awakening to the idea that everything had to be super formal.

[22:39:21] <riv> and (x1 - a1, x2 - a2) is just the ideal generated by all finite sums of multiples x1 - a1 and x2 - a2

[22:39:34] <alphamule> That is, 4,16,....
[22:39:35] <isekaijin> Guest1778: Because a linear combination of polynomials is again a polynomial. And an ideal is not a polynomial, but a whole set of them.
[22:39:40] <riv> and V((x1 - a1, x2 - a2)) is the variety you can make frmo that ideal
[22:40:01] <alphamule> Since input is put back in same, you can just define it inductively
[22:40:08] <Guest1778> oh, you're right, I did not say they were sets.
[22:40:15] <alphamule> This is true for n, thus n+1, thus n+2
[22:40:15] <Guest1778> riv Thank you.
[22:40:26] <riv> now this is extremely minor
[22:40:28] <riv> but I wrote V((x1 - a1, x2 - a2))
[22:40:32] <riv> and you wrote V(x1 - a1, x2 - a2)
[22:40:34] <cuppajoeman> I know how to prove it by induction, the question is about if that is the nicest way
[22:40:40] <alphamule> It's up to you to write this formally how the instructor wants to know.
[22:40:43] <riv> I believe that V((x1 - a1, x2 - a2)) is clearer

[22:41:48] <isekaijin> Double parentheses like (( )) are for formal Laurent series rings!
[22:41:52] <cuppajoeman> I thought we might be able to do it directly
[22:42:14] <alphamule> Well, every time you multiple 4 mod 12 by 4...
[22:42:21] <alphamule> You're adding 12
[22:42:21] <Guest1778> Was the example I gave earlier correct?
[22:42:32] <alphamule> And since 12 mod 12 is 0...
[22:42:45] <alphamule> Any multiple of 12 is 0 mod 12 so...
[22:42:55] <alphamule> 12%12 I meant not '12 mod 12'
[22:43:04] <alphamule> Remainder of 0
[22:43:31] <riv> The extra brackets are not useless
[22:43:31] <alphamule> Rather this is best... it seems so.
[22:43:37] <riv> V(x1 - a1, x2 - a2) looks like V is a function that takes 2 inputs
[22:43:53] <riv> V((x1 - a1, x2 - a2)) looks like V is a function that takes 1 input, which it is. And that input is the ideal generated by 2 elements
[22:44:05] <riv> the fact we use () for ideals and function calls is just a coincidence
[22:44:26] <riv> if we used [] for ideals, we would write V([x1 - a1, x2 - a2]) and nobody would think of throwing away one set of brackets
[22:44:31] <alphamule> 4*4 = (3+1)*4 is just restating same idea.
[22:45:27] <riv> The reason I said "this is extremely minor" is because it's totally fine to write V(x1 - a1, x2 - a2) and we know what was meant. But if you are learning these things for the first time and having notational difficulties it's useful for someone to clearly explain these minor points
[22:46:03] <alphamule> I saw this sort of math in grade school so it is likely pretty easy by most people's standards.  :/
[22:46:14] <cuppajoeman> What about this one 4 ≡ 1 (mod 3) so 4^n ≡ 1^n (mod 3), thus 3 | 4^n - 1. Then 4^n ≡ 4 (mod 12) is only true when 12  | 4^n - 4 = 4 (4^(n-1) - 1) , since 3 | 4^(n-1) -1, then it's true.
[22:46:23] <cuppajoeman> No induction required in this proof

[23:43:38] <qedders> Simplar a=b=1 is one such pair
[23:45:23] <Simplar> qedders: that's quite obv one
[23:46:06] <Simplar> So (2^n)a+b must divide c^n+1...

[23:48:55] <Simplar>  Suppose b is an odd number
[23:49:06] <Simplar> ...wait why am i doing it
[23:49:20] <Simplar> even divided by odd = can be odd or even
[23:51:11] <Simplar> wait no
[23:51:16] <Simplar> even/odd = even
[23:51:40] <alphamule> 2^(na) or (2^n)a?
[23:51:46] <Simplar> (2^n)a.
[23:52:13] <Simplar> odd/even will never have a remainder 0
[23:52:22] <Simplar> thus odd/even is never an integer

[23:52:46] <Simplar> wait but this gives a clue to the problem
[23:52:52] <Josep> if I have the sequence 1.7,2.2,3.9,3.11,14.7 the sample median for this is 3.9 or 3.11 ? I got 3.9
[23:52:52] <alphamule> And of course, anything with a remainder of 0 is divided evently, so...
[23:53:02] <alphamule> evenly
[23:53:03] <Josep> but my teacher got 3.11 for some reason idk why
[23:53:27] <Simplar> alphamule: odd/odd = odd
[23:54:07] <Josep> are you talking to me?
[23:54:43] <alphamule> They are out of order
[23:54:46] <Simplar> Josep: sample median is 1.95
[23:55:07] <Josep> how is that?

[23:55:43] <Josep> why 3.11 ?
[23:55:48] <Josep> do I have to order them?
[23:55:54] <Josep> to put them in order?
[23:55:56] <biberao> 3.11
[23:55:58] <Simplar> Yes, sort them
[23:55:58] <biberao> is the median
[23:56:02] <Simplar> And then take the one in the middle
[23:56:06] <Josep> oh I have to sort them first?
[23:56:08] <alphamule> The median is based on the middle of a range
[23:56:12] <Simplar> Josep: of course
[23:56:12] <alphamule> So yes, order

[23:56:25] <Josep> thats weird since it says that medians are independent of outliers
[23:56:37] <Josep> so if I add a new number and sort them again they depend on outliers lol
[23:56:40] <alphamule> Yes, but...
[23:56:53] <Josep> I mean they are not caluclated using them but they are affected by them I suppose
[23:57:02] <alphamule> Yeah, that's more precise
[23:57:15] <alphamule> They're never an outlier except in the degenerate case
[23:57:22] <biberao> atleast python says its 3.11
[23:57:26] <Josep> alright thanks
[23:57:30] <Josep> yeah no problem
