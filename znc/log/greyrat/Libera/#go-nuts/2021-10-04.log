[01:46:39] <attila_lendvai> guix is a package manager. it wants to mirror the go dependencies into its own realm, hence the importer i am working on.
[01:46:50] <b0nn> dostoyevsky2: You saw this? https://sj14.gitlab.io/post/2018/07-01-go-unix-shell/
[01:47:25] <attila_lendvai> some go modules are not on the toplevel of the repo directory, e.g. bigtable.
[01:48:37] <attila_lendvai> but i have no clue where i should know that this module lives inside the bigtable directory. my best guess is that i need to compare the last piece of the repo-url with the "module-name" url, but that stinks...
[01:49:06] <attila_lendvai> b0nn, IOW, this is neck deep in go modules and the semantics of their urls

What is the best way to kill all handler goroutines? I can terminate splicing by closing a channel, but what about before that? Do I have to wrap every exchange in select checking if the channel is closed or is there a better way?

[07:43:01] <b0nn> HisShadow_: Are you asking how to communicate to client handlers based on the state of the server?
[07:44:12] <b0nn> prologic: Are there subtle differences in the urls? eg trailing slash, http vs https vs no protocol?
[07:46:01] <prologic> b0nn yes, but I handle that as much as possible
[07:46:19] <prologic> I don't handle the http vs https case though, bit hard without more heuristics

[07:52:19] <prologic> For example I'm not sure how to deal with nonsense like this:
[07:52:21] <prologic>       1 NEW FEED: @<~mr_woggle http://tilde.town/~mr_woggle/twtxt.txt>
[07:52:21] <prologic>       1 NEW FEED: @<~mr_woggle https://tilde.town/~mr_woggle/twtxt.txt>
[07:52:21] <prologic> :D
[07:52:37] <b0nn> ol
[07:52:40] <b0nn> er, lol
[07:52:41] <prologic> Especially across concurrent goroutines in what is essentially a crawler and scraper
[07:52:57] <prologic> As a human I can tell those are the same, if you visit each they are identical
[07:53:05] <prologic> So it's just nonsense infra right there :D
[07:53:40] <b0nn> yeah - unless you remove http.?:// from urls
[07:53:52] <prologic> To handle this I'd have to complicated things even further and reach into the db looking for a similar(iso) uri that differs say by just the scheme
[07:54:02] *** Joins: xiongxin (~quassel@119.123.103.95)
[07:54:12] <prologic> Then they wouldn't be valid no? :D
[07:54:20] <b0nn> but then you'll hit www.tile.town vs tilde.town (and all of the variants )
[07:54:26] <prologic> Or do you mean ignore the scum part for comparision?
[07:54:35] <prologic> exactly
[07:54:36] <b0nn> for comparison
[07:54:41] <prologic> There's just so much inconsistent crap out there
[07:54:47] <prologic> No matter what type of space you want to crawl
[07:55:17] <prologic> We had this argument/discussion once before though and I'm not sure what the conclusion was
[07:55:26] <prologic> Good thing I wrote. A search engine so I can go find that discussion and re-read it :D
[07:55:46] <prologic> But basically it was: should we consider gopher:// http:// and https:// or even gemini:// all the same feed as long as the domain/path are all the same?
[07:56:00] <prologic> Like who would serve a different feed over gopher/gemini vs http/https?
[07:56:07] <prologic> Probably some crazy person I'm sure :D
[07:58:42] <b0nn> what are the feeds?
[07:58:51] <b0nn> rss?
[08:02:21] <prologic> Twtxt feeds actually
[08:02:49] <prologic> Part of a decentralised social platform I've been building since Jul 2020 ;)
[08:03:04] <prologic> Not twtxt (that spec/format existed since 2016) but what I'm building

[08:09:14] <wroathe> Is there a way to force the go runtime to use only a single thread via an environment variable or runtime flag of some kind without having to recompile the program?
[08:09:40] <wroathe> Specifically I'm trying to figure out why delve isn't hitting breakpoints I expect it to hit, and I suspect it has to do with thread affinity
[08:09:43] <Awoobis> GOMAXPROCS=1
[08:09:57] <wroathe> Awoobis: Thanks!
[08:10:03] <Awoobis> IIRC, anyway
[08:10:05] <Awoobis> that SHOULD work
[08:10:18] <wroathe> Ah, I see that here: https://pkg.go.dev/runtime
[08:10:54] <KirkMcDonald> As that documentation notes, the runtime may spin up additional threads as-needed to make syscalls.
[08:11:37] <wroathe> KirkMcDonald: The breakpoints I'm trying to hit are part of "userland" code anyway
[08:14:03] *** Joins: jpw (~jpw@user/jpw)
[08:14:06] <b0nn> uhhh you can still have multiple goroutines with a single thread though
[08:14:14] <Awoobis> ^
[08:14:28] <Awoobis> the runtime will still multiplex goroutines onto that single thread
[08:14:32] <KirkMcDonald> I would naively expect thread affinity to only pop up as an issue if you're, say, dealing with an OS-level event loop.
[08:14:48] <KirkMcDonald> Or otherwise interacting with the system in some unusual way.
[08:14:57] <Awoobis> (and, that being the case, runtime.LockOSThread(), would be the fix)
[08:15:02] <KirkMcDonald> Yes.

[08:16:08] <wroathe> I'm unclear on how delve is supposed to operate wrt to threads and goroutines, so this was just me testing a hypothesis
[08:16:19] *** Joins: jpw (~jpw@user/jpw)
[08:16:27] <wroathe> So far it doesn't seem to need me to manually switch between goroutines to hit breakpoints
[08:16:31] <Awoobis> when you have a breakpoint it stops the current and all other goroutines
[08:16:38] <wroathe> And so I figured I'd test if it was an OS thread affinity issue
[08:16:42] <Awoobis> and it selects the goroutine that hit the breakpoint
[08:16:49] <wroathe> Yup
[08:18:06] <wroathe> I used the "trace" command set set tracepoints on a broad swath of routines to see where this process was passively burning CPU cycles, and I see it hitting the same routine over and over again, but after clearing those tracepoints and setting a breakpoint on it I can't seem to get it to hit

[14:09:10] <fizzie> Yes, I wouldn't necessarily expect you can just delete a go.mod file of a "submodule" (not a great word, given that it's not really part of its parent, except in terms of the physical source code location). At least it definitely wouldn't work if ./go.mod says `module example.com/foo` while ./bar/go.mod says anything else than `module example.com/foo/bar`.

[14:13:07] <fizzie> Well, you know. If your root directory's go.mod says `module example.com/foo`, and there's no other go.mod files around, then the package in the subdirectory bar must be imported as "example.com/foo/bar". If that directory currently had a go.mod file that said anything else, then code in it wouldn't have been written with that import path in mind.

[15:27:31] <attila_lendvai> actually, i think this is also some bug: this dependency is not present in go-ethereum's go.sum, which supposed to be the transitive closure of all dependencies, right?

[20:07:22] <aberrant> silly question: Why would we do a "defer func() { _ = listener.Close() }()" instead of just "defer listener.Close()" ?
[20:07:51] <Awoobis> because the latter will give you a linter error for not checking the exception, the former explicitly ignores it

[20:12:32] <s_> if I have an api endpoint that does something similar to https://play.golang.org/p/x0mKeThwt6G (basically, reads from two data sources) is the cpu churn that occurs due to the if !ok { continue } statements going to meaningfully harm performance in any way?
[20:13:37] <s_> the example is a bit contrived for illustrative purposes, realistically it should be rare, but possible, for one of the two channels to have been closed and I'm trying to establish if that's something I need to work around and avoid

[20:17:11] <krux02> I don't want to repeat the `Do B` part in my code
[20:17:55] <krux02> Awoobis, that linter problem can be fixed by disabling the linter
[20:18:11] <krux02> and delete it from the system

[20:18:39] <j416> krux02: no
[20:18:57] <krux02> j416, no to my question or my answer?
[20:19:04] <j416> to your question
[20:19:07] <krux02> ok
[20:19:08] <krux02> :(
[20:19:16] <j416> I don't typically answer answers
[20:19:33] <krux02> well you can disagree on them with "no"
[20:20:08] <j416> krux02: does the switch have more than one type in it?
[20:20:11] <krux02> but honestly, I am not new to go, I just had a several years long break and now I my toolchain came with a linter enabled by default.
[20:20:21] <krux02> j416, no
[20:20:24] <j416> krux02: use an if then
[20:20:28] <krux02> how?
[20:20:37] <krux02> how do I check the type in an if?
[20:20:40] <Tv_> s_: set your channel variables to nil after you see them close
[20:20:52] <j416> also, it's nice if the example you send is actually runnable because then it's easy to modify and send back :)
[20:20:55] <Tv_> s_: otherwise, that's a busy loop as soon as one closes
[20:21:36] <krux02> I think I can look it up
