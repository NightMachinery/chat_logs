[01:06:39] <kirch> I got a box of M:tG cards.... collected from like 1998-2002... mostly junk, probably; I'm certain there's some counterfeit Black Lotus cards in there - I know a few are from a promotional deck that some tournament champion used...

[01:40:38] <gwozniak> I find 5th edition D&D to be really well done. I'm told 4th edition is best forgotten

[18:46:56] <epilys> so this privacy software non-profit approached me for job, agreed everything and I was waiting to receive the contract and now they tell me it turns out they don't actually have any money so they can't hire me
[18:47:49] <Brekkjern> Sounds like you dodged a bullet
[18:48:43] <gwozniak> But the experience is worth it!
[18:48:48] <gwozniak>  /s
[18:49:24] <epilys> no they were clear that they want to compensate me at least
[18:51:24] <epilys> I keep dodging bullets but at some point I have to accept getting shot
[18:52:19] <epilys> a year ago I "dodged" a (funded) kubernetes startup that was based in california because they wanted me to sign a non-compete. I even told them non-competes are invalid in California and in my country yet they wanted me to sign it
[18:59:32] <ngoldbaum> i probably would have just signed it, it’s worthless in CA
[19:02:06] <pja> I find it super frustrating that the legal profession is completely fine with approving contracts that contain obviously unenforceable terms.
[19:02:43] <pja> They just stick them in there to intimidate people who can’t afford decent legal representation. It’s immoral imo.
[19:02:58] <pja> Ought to be against their professional body’s code to even consider it.
[19:04:09] <gwozniak> In some cases it might be the biz folks making the contract without much in the way of legal consultation. Nevertheless, I agree with the sentiment
[19:04:56] <gwozniak> I'm fairly certain the startup I worked for drew up their own contracts
[19:07:31] <pja> Last work contract I had I went through striking out a bunch of clauses that had been explicitly made unenforceable by either UK primary law or case law from the last twenty years or so.
[19:07:50] <pja> (Or was that a previous thing? Anyway, relatively recently)
[19:08:10] <pja> Left a bad taste in the mouth - it sets up the relationship as adversarial right from the start if you
[19:08:32] <pja> put clauses like that into your default contracts imo.
[19:09:01] <ngoldbaum> the whole hiring process is like that
[19:09:34] <ngoldbaum> just setting up the essentially adversarial boss/employee relationship

[22:53:59] <indigo> Just curious, does anyone have any recommendations for a TV antenna? Thinking of recording some Jeopardy
[22:56:09] <jjuran> You can generally find the recent ones on YouTube, though at lower resolution
[22:56:33] <indigo> I know, I've been watching them on YouTube but the recordings are rather glitchy
[22:56:36] <jjuran> Jeopardy episodes, I mean, not antennae
[22:57:09] <ngoldbaum> indigo: you live in LA, right? unless you’re behind a hill and can’t see the mountains the TV signal is going to be good with any antenna
[22:58:13] <jjuran> Huh, I didn't have a problem with the video quality.  I love that they're commercial-free. :-)
[22:58:27] <indigo> jjuran: I hear with Plex you can auto-remove commercials
[22:58:47] <indigo> It's less about the video quality, and more about the fact that the recording sometimes freezes and skips time
[22:59:11] <indigo> ngoldbaum: Ok awesome. I'll pick a cheapie one up then
[22:59:22] <ngoldbaum> if you have cable coax i think the cable companies still have to give away ota channels for free
[22:59:49] <indigo> I also searched for this, and I read that Spectrum just encrypts all the channels
[23:00:32] <jjuran> Are you sure that's the recording and not the playback?
[23:00:32] <jjuran> I use youtubedown and watch offline
[23:02:08] <indigo> Yeah, it's the recording
[23:02:14] <indigo> The time still ticks down when it's frozen
[23:03:22] <indigo> LeVar Burton is such a great guest host though :)
[23:03:35] <indigo> I feel like he stumbled a bit on his first episode but he is doing much better now
[23:03:51] <jjuran> I really liked Ken Jennings and Mayim Bialik
[23:07:50] <ngoldbaum> who do you think will replace trebek?
[23:07:58] <ngoldbaum> pancreatic cancer is a bitch :/
[23:08:26] <indigo> I hope it's LeVar
