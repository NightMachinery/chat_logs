[00:14:54] <arryana> you think everything in life should be 'fair' by your definition?
[00:14:58] <arryana> that seems rather childish to me
[00:15:07] <causative_> yes, everything *should* be fair
[00:15:24] <causative_> fairness is the ideal
[00:15:26] <Jong> I agree with causative
[00:15:38] <Bakunin> how do you analyze fairness
[00:15:50] <Bakunin> (nobody has an answer)
[00:16:13] <Bakunin> some chinese guy bitching about a museum is what passes for philosophy I guess
[00:16:26] <Jong> it's analyzed on a case by case basis, and a few billionaires making money off the met is not fair.
[00:16:30] <causative_> a policy is fair when it leads to greater success for the whole society
[00:16:46] <Bakunin> then fairness is not to be sought
[00:16:50] <causative_> for example, it is fair to reward people who do good things, so that more people will do good things, and society as a whole will benefit from that
[00:16:55] <str0> Bakunin, I'm guessing they have an utalitarian view
[00:17:00] <Bakunin> society is not built on "benefits"
[00:17:07] <causative_> it is fair to punish people who do bad things, so that fewer people will do bad things, and society as a whole will benefit from that
[00:17:27] <Bakunin> why is charging admission to a museum a "bad thing"
[00:18:10] <causative_> well I don't think it is, unless the admission charge is unreasonably high
[00:18:15] <Bakunin> why is it fair for museum workers to never be paid money, why is it fair that artefacts should be on display to the public for any reason
[00:18:18] <Bakunin> etc
[00:18:24] <Bakunin> child brains in action
[00:18:26] <causative_> or unless the museum was paid for by taxpayer dollars with the understanding it would be free to all
[00:18:55] <Bakunin> so, your tax dollars should go towards looting other cultures and putting their art in museums
[00:19:04] <causative_> we do see this with toll roads - the road is built with the promise that tolls will pay for it over X years, then it will be free.  then X years pass and the tolls don't go away.
[00:19:19] <causative_> that's certainly not fair
[00:19:25] <Bakunin> of course it is
[00:19:31] <causative_> a promise was broken
[00:19:31] <Bakunin> they paid for the road, it's their private road.
[00:19:40] <Bakunin> they can charge as much as they want
[00:19:43] <causative_> I'm talking about public toll roads
[00:19:43] <Bakunin> welcome to capitalism

[00:20:02] <Bakunin> the state is capitalist
[00:21:02] <str0> What do you think about UBI?
[00:21:05] <str0> universal basic income
[00:21:34] <causative_> UBI will be necessary if humans want to continue to exist as humans in the coming age of AI
[00:22:17] <arryana> the met is pay-as-you-wish for anyone who lives in new york state. that's a remarkably egalitarian stance which allows access to millions of people.
[00:22:24] <causative_> more realistically, I don't think UBI could be sustained in the long term, because the people with the wealth and power will gain nothing from it
[00:22:58] <arryana> i don't see the basis for your complaints, jong
[00:23:08] <str0> causative_, so what if they don't?
[00:23:15] <causative_> the alternative to UBI is that everyone starves once the AIs can do their jobs better and cheaper. And that's what will probably happen.
[00:23:34] <causative_> except for the wealthy elites who own the AIs - they will prosper beyond their dreams
[00:23:53] <str0> They already can, there is so many useless jobs just for the sake of there being jobs.
[00:24:02] <Bakunin> thats how it is now causative_
[00:24:12] <Bakunin> most humans are useless eaters
[00:24:21] <Bakunin> the people who really run things are the ones benefiting
[00:24:31] <Bakunin> the rest remain on the useless eater treadmill.
[00:24:51] <str0> useless to the economy that is
[00:24:53] <Bakunin> They actually don't deserve freedom.  They deserve to be worker underclass.  Normal human existence since forever
[00:25:10] <causative_> I don't think it's like that Bakunin , a business owner is not going to willingly employ a lot of useless people if the business can just cut their jobs without losing anything
[00:25:33] <Bakunin> that's also false
[00:25:41] <Bakunin> most jobs at large companies are bullshit jobs
[00:25:44] <causative_> however, legislation can create useless jobs, e.g. by mandating a certain process that needs to be done by humans
[00:25:54] <Bakunin> they aren't automated because the state incentivizes this bullshit employment
[00:25:59] <causative_> and that kind of useless job is a sort of alternative to UBI
[00:26:03] <Bakunin> companies get tax breaks
[00:26:29] <Bakunin> Do you have an example?
[00:27:15] <causative_> well, tax attorneys are a "useless job" created by the state
[00:27:37] <causative_> the state has put into place policies that create what should be unnecessary employment
[00:28:22] <causative_> because they've made the tax code so complicated that an attorney is necessary
[00:28:45] <Bakunin> the tax code wasn't made by an extrinsic entity
[00:28:52] <Bakunin> it's tax payers who write tax law
[00:31:18] <causative_> another example would be car dealerships, in many states it is illegal for carmakers to sell cars directly to customers without a dealer involved
[00:31:43] <causative_> so the car dealership employees have legislation-created useless jobs
[00:32:40] <causative_> but in private enterprise, a business owner wants to reduce payroll, so he'd fire any useless workers that he knows are useless
[00:33:17] <Bakunin> you know the tax law is the way it is because tax payers created it, right?
[00:33:35] <causative_> well, corporate lobbyists created it
[00:34:01] <Bakunin> ... who are in agreement with the representatives of the people
[00:34:04] <Bakunin> ie the taxpayers
[00:34:20] <Bakunin> everyone's happy with the tax code, or nobody can agree on any changes besides "lower taxes"
[00:34:24] <causative_> "the representatives of the people" are not "the taxpayers"
[00:34:39] <Bakunin> no but it's a representative republic
[00:34:54] <Bakunin> or, it isn't, and it's an oligarchy by design.
[00:35:02] <causative_> it's not very good representation, due to the influence of corporate money on the lawmakers
[00:35:05] <Bakunin> either way, powerless to change it
[00:35:14] <Bakunin> right and you can't ban that, so
[00:35:27] <Bakunin> What if this is as good as it gets?
[00:35:38] <causative_> well, you can ban it if you're a Western democracy other than the USA
[00:36:11] <causative_> what the USA calls "lobbying," other Western countries would call illegal "bribery"
[00:36:24] <Bakunin> can you name a country whose anti-graft/racketeering laws I can peruse?

[00:57:48] <mycroftiv> causative_: ive realized for what im working on, your insights are completely central, the mathematics of higher order cybernetic emergence and computational networks for making optimal decisions. totally agreeed on something like UBI
[00:58:54] <mycroftiv> i think the duality between description and construction and the logical flexibility that happens once systems have to be future-oriented is relevant though, and that is where ultrafilters and large cardinals and the classical/constructive issues enter
[01:01:10] <causative_> with you until the ultrafilters and large cardinals
[01:01:38] <mycroftiv> causative_: its because of the relation of decision making and democracy and ultrafilters, which is a theorem of voting systems
[01:02:03] <mycroftiv> trying to take 'votes from the future' means you have potentially infinite nuymber of votes you want to count
[01:02:10] <causative_> the essential feature of intelligence is:  try something, with a result in mind. Did you get the desired result? If so, do more of that kind of thing. If not, stop doing that kind of thing so much.
[01:02:19] <mycroftiv> fair democratic voting with no dictator among an infinite number of voters = free ultrafilter
[01:02:45] <mycroftiv> causative_: yes, and for the best long term decisions, you want to understand the future results
[01:02:47] *** Parts: Bakunin (~x@user/lindis) ()
[01:03:06] <causative_> you don't need an ultrafilter for that, you just need exponential discounting
[01:03:08] <mycroftiv> so you want your feedback loop to somehow take data from the future to feedback into the present, which sounds impossible, but you can simulate the future
[01:03:27] <str0> What is an ultrafilter?
[01:03:28] <mycroftiv> there are many mathematical techniques, i agree
[01:03:45] <mycroftiv> str0: its a formal mathematical concept that encodes 'almost all' in a fair way that extends binary 0/1 logic to infinite sets
[01:04:01] <causative_> i.e. if you get a reward R, t time units in the future, it's worth R c^-t for some c > 1
[01:04:28] <causative_> er
[01:04:34] <mycroftiv> causative_: some ethical theories believe future votes shouldnt be discounted relative to present
[01:04:39] <causative_> yeah
[01:05:08] <causative_> well, if you don't discount them then the sum of rewards will be infinite
[01:05:12] <mycroftiv> so dealing properly with truly infinite sets is what set theory is good at, and where ultrafilters come in, if you want math that can deal with hypothetical cosmological horizons
[01:05:21] <causative_> and you stop being able to compare sums of rewards from different scenarios
[01:05:24] <mycroftiv> causative_: exactly, dealing properly with infinite sets
[01:05:50] <mycroftiv> causative_: that is where studying more axiomatic set theory is needed for people creating these decision making systems with potentially infinite horizons and what ive been working on
[01:06:12] <mycroftiv> how to deal properly with the measure problems that happen with infinity, including uncountable infinity
[01:06:33] <causative_> I don't think you need transfinite numbers for that, even if you do something nonstandard
[01:06:36] <mycroftiv> the full cosmological state space might be of truly large cardinality
[01:06:39] <causative_> the time steps are countable
[01:06:55] <causative_> or at worst, the cardinality of R
[01:07:29] <causative_> one thing you could do is look at the limit as the discounting factor approaches 1
[01:07:34] <mycroftiv> cardinality of the reals gets you into model theoretic flexibility and all kinds of cool stuff, that is where i get interested in the possibilities
[01:08:09] <causative_> i.e. what's the best policy when the discounting factor is 0.9? how about when it's 0.99999? How about when it's 0.99999999999? If that converges to some particular policy, then you could say the policy it converges to is the "un-discounted" optimal policy
[01:08:09] <mycroftiv> there are speculative physicists who believe forcing models of ZFC could be relevant to the kind of spacetime manifold we are in, exotic R4 theorists
[01:09:03] <mycroftiv> there are some really strange scenarios if something like exotic r4 and a very rich multiverse are in play in final physics
[01:09:16] <causative_> another thing you could do is look at big-O complexity of the cumulative rewards as a function of time
[01:09:46] <mycroftiv> the computational complexity of the universe and limits of quantum computation and the universe predicting itself are really deep in this regard
[01:10:11] <mycroftiv> there are inherent limits to how well you can understand yourself and local environment before things like no-cloning kick in
[01:10:32] <causative_> what do you mean, "no-cloning"?

[01:11:49] <mycroftiv> local anti-entropic systems are a recent interest of mine
[01:11:58] <mycroftiv> creating a macroscopic anti-entropic bubble around yourself
[01:12:07] <mycroftiv> it can only be done temporarily with good preplanning
[01:12:28] <mycroftiv> then you can make time go backward in a sense, information theoretically, on small scale
[01:12:47] <mycroftiv> because the arrow of time is just the direction of organization of local information
