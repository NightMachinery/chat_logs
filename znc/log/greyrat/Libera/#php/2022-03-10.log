[00:15:53] <__adrian> i sat on an interview recently. internal applicant for a jr position. do they like coding? don't know. what have they worked on? nothing really. did you look up the word "programmer" before you came to this interview? no, why?
[00:16:20] <Sammitch> I've worked with a couple guys that had clearly decided that they knew everything and had stopped learning years ago
[00:16:58] <da_wunder> Sammitch: same here
[00:17:03] <teresko> I had candidate for "Senior Dev" position who had never heard about SOLID
[00:17:11] <teresko> today
[00:17:14] *** Joins: jaykelly450 (~vagrant@c-73-82-49-38.hsd1.ga.comcast.net)
[00:18:00] <teresko> and had no idea what unit tests actually are
[00:18:02] <da_wunder> teresko: for me that is just telling that your recruiment pipeline is missing some basic checks before live meeting
[00:18:47] <teresko> hell, the HR department does not even bother the explain the candidates "what business is this"
[00:19:22] <da_wunder> that sounds totally wrong...
[00:19:42] <Albright> I know what unit tests are but I couldn't tell you what SOLID is.
[00:19:52] <da_wunder> our hr deparment is trying to do everything to avoid candicates like that
[00:20:14] <__adrian> applicants are used to it. recruiters try hard to appear as though they're the actual company you're applying to, so it's not unusual that they couldn't answer that question with any amount of specificity
[00:21:14] <da_wunder> couple of years ago we used simple fizzbuzz task on interviews - do that on paper
[00:21:53] <teresko> next time I need a new job, I will just call up a recruiting company and ask them - what they can offer to me
[00:22:20] <Sammitch> "are you actually a senior programmer, or were you just at your last company longer than your coworkers?"
[00:22:41] <Albright> Sammitch: Well, how would you define "senior programmer?"
[00:22:53] * teresko has job history of ~8 companies over 15 year
[00:22:58] <Sammitch> skills. ability.
[00:23:00] <__adrian> over 55 years old, of course
[00:23:18] <teresko> that's "senile programmer"
[00:23:20] <da_wunder> I have been in same company since 2009
[00:23:20] <Albright> Sammitch: And how would you quantify those?
[00:23:27] <__adrian> "are you willing to share your Denny's discount card with the team"
[00:23:33] <Albright> teresko: No, that's someone who uses Node.
[00:23:45] <Sammitch> again, those couple guys I mentioned earlier were both "senior" and had absolutely awful practices and produced horrible code
[00:24:25] <teresko> ... or you get "laravel programmer" LD
[00:24:26] <Sammitch> I would go as far as to say that one of them was an active detriment to the company
[00:24:26] <teresko> :D
[00:26:14] <da_wunder> teresko: so what is wrong with laravel programmers?
[00:27:10] <teresko> should I treat it as a serious question or retorical one?
[00:28:58] <TML> teresko:  Pray tell, what exactly _are_ the benefits of "single point of entry" application structure. I've never noticed any.
[00:29:08] <da_wunder> with serious - I don't personally like laravel - but I'm not against that - I like symfony more - and now we've couple co-workers that have been used laravel and not symfony - and there is some minor "issues"
[00:30:22] <Albright> TML: As opposed to WP-style direct access of PHP files? You can have your site/application routing be separate from the structure of your application code files.
[00:30:39] <TML> Albright: But how is that a benefit?
[00:31:04] <Albright> I see the benefit as self-explanatory.
[00:31:34] <Albright> How would you do MVC without a proper router system?
[00:31:36] <TML> That seems to me like one of the DOWNSIDES of the SPoE system - you now have to manage two competing routing systems (httpd and your PHP application), and their interactions create things you have to debug. If you rely on the httpd for routing, there's nothing to get wrong.
[00:31:58] <teresko> da_wunder: depends on how deep-in they are, because what that community teaches is quite a mess - abuse of global state, various singlton/registry structures, obsession syntax sugar, complete disregard for Separation of Concerns, active record with the associated lack of SQL knowledge ... and those are just the generaic maladies they have
[00:32:02] <TML> something something code that doesn't exist something bugs
[00:32:03] <Albright> httpd doesn't really do any routing besides "run everything through index.php"
[00:32:28] <TML> Albright: "WP-style direct access of PHP files" is also known as "letting the httpd do the routing"
[00:32:50] <Albright> Yeah, I know. I still work on sites which do that.
[00:32:58] <Albright> WP and otherwise.
[00:33:17] <da_wunder> teresko: so basically the same list of things that I have figured out, thanks for sharing that
[00:33:20] <teresko> only benefit for WP is that it uwordpress sites usually come pre-shelled :D
[00:35:13] <teresko> da_wunder: it might be the issue of TCP/IP being bad at communicating tone - I meant "laravel developer" the same way as you would say "jquery developer"
[00:36:11] <da_wunder> I hate jquery - you really don't need that anymore
[00:36:15] <teresko> as in, the person who never has actuyally bothered to even poke at the underlaying programming language, while portraying himself as "prefessional"

[00:37:35] <Sammitch> [impenetrable layers of boilerplate]
[00:39:16] <da_wunder> I'm not so sure that is the use case in my case - all those laravel devs are actually really good, in my point of view - they all want to write more tests, point out correct things in code review, share opinions about how we should do some new feature, and so on

[00:44:15] <teresko> it's not an unreasonable poisition
[00:44:57] <da_wunder> teresko: not really - these new ones have really surprised me - earlier laravel users haven't
[00:47:21] <teresko> TML: the thing is - if you are using httpd to outsource routing, not everyone use apache .. hell, them most don't
[00:48:53] <teresko> and SPoE does not mean that you actually only one of those - there is nothins stopping you from having public/api.php for your REST application, public/web.php for the website application and also separate one for CMS, while the all use the same code for Model Layer
[00:49:47] <teresko> *they all
[00:51:45] <TML> teresko: Well, using both just sounds like buying both sets of pain. But I am not sure what your point is about whether people use Apache or not.
[00:53:21] <teresko> do you deploy your application with the reoutes defined?
[00:53:34] <TML> Yes, in the httpd config
[00:53:39] <The_Blode> I've not been programming long.

[00:55:41] <teresko> good for you
[00:55:52] <TML> the httpd config is just a part of the application, not sure why you'd make an arbitrary division like "you as a developer should not be touching httpd config"
[00:56:08] <Albright> In smaller orgs, that's probably fine.
[00:56:12] <The_Blode> Not sure why teresko you're trying to attack people on this channel.
[00:56:33] <The_Blode> In my company, it's a bigger one so we have a team of engineers who take care of httpd for us.
[00:56:34] <Albright> Larger ones have dedicated sysadmins whose job it is just to keep the servers running as performantly and stably as possible.
[00:56:40] <The_Blode> ^
[00:56:55] <TML> Albright: How large is "larger"?
[00:57:06] <Albright> Those sysadmins aren't going to want devs messing with their finely-tuned configs.

[00:57:59] <TML> When I worked at Novell in the 1990s we expected every software engineer to be able to configure the servers, and everyone in the engineering department took their 3 month rotation being the on-call techs
[00:57:59] <Albright> Of course there's not a hard definition for "larger." Just one that's busy enough that they can hire a dedicated sysadmin person/team.
[00:58:22] <Albright> Okay, well, that was the first decade of the web.
[00:58:36] <TML> Albright: I have found that the busier you get, the better off you are _not_ having artificial divisions of labor like that.
[00:58:46] <__adrian> we have devs AND sysadmins AND sysadmin-devops AND dev-devops
[00:58:47] <Albright> Artificial…
[00:58:51] <TML> If everyone can do every job, whatever job is busiest can have the most engineers on it
[00:59:11] <teresko> "we did that in 90s" sounds like troll to me
[00:59:11] <Albright> That's a "jack of all trades, master of none" approach.
[00:59:30] <__adrian> sure
[00:59:34] <Albright> I *can* do sysadmin, and do for some of my clients, but a dedicated sysadmin would surely do it better than I do.
[00:59:46] <__adrian> you know, the second half of that is "...is better than a master of one"
[00:59:49] <The_Blode> teresko: do you want to back off a bit please. He's speaking his truth.
[01:00:05] <TML> teresko: Well, I continue to run organizations that way today, I'm just not with someone the size of Novell anymore. I work more in the "300 employees" companies now than in the "30000 employees" ones, and *consult* for the bigger ones.

[01:06:37] <TML> and/or RecursiveDirectoryIterator
[01:06:43] <teresko> TML: getting back to the original argument - if you are running very simple infrastructure, then you can still have developers being really full stack and have the same guy who slices HTML/CSS also setting up the master-master failover for your database. But if you are working on a project that strarts to need actual systems, like DB clusters, deployment pipelines, etc. those can't be managed buy superstar

[01:07:53] <The_Blode> Yeah that's true. We do have one superstar in my company but he alone cannot manage all the clusters.
[01:08:00] <TML> Every task always has a mix of both
[01:08:01] <__adrian> they certainly can keep up with enough to be full-stack with their own application
[01:08:03] <The_Blode> It's a combination of engineering and development teams

[01:13:17] <da_wunder> TML: we have all those + support and ICT
[01:13:42] <TML> da_wunder: We expect engineers to take a rotation through IT
[01:15:14] <da_wunder> TML: in our case that would makes things really hard - each dev needs to know aws, azure and gcp - and really know how to setup those, update and maintain
[01:15:21] <TML> da_wunder: Everyone at the Director level and above can readily be a senior in at least 2 areas, with a few who can do 3 areas and some who can do all (where our internal divisions are: F/E engineering, B/E engineering, Operations/Infrastructure, IT, and Internal Tools)
[01:16:33] <TML> da_wunder: We don't use GCP today, but expect everyone to manage their own AWS and Azure accounts under the parent Organization. We allow them to run up to $1000/month of personal infrastructure as an enticement to be regularly poking around in both IaaS spaces.
[01:17:12] <TML> I should say "under the respective parent organizations"
[01:17:13] <da_wunder> oh, that is nice benefit
[01:18:36] <TML> da_wunder: Comparitively, it's a pretty cheap way of making sure all of our employees can pass the respective certification programs, which are crucial to us maintaining our partnership levels with the providers, which gives us discounts that almost pay for the benefit anyway :)
[01:19:10] <__adrian> i never got an expense budget, but did end up with my rack because (a) decommissioned servers, and (b) used to get free time for professional dev.
[01:19:34] <TML> Not quite, we end up eating about $300/employee/month - but we figure it's cheaper than paying for them all to sit through professional training once / year

[01:28:46] <TML> Boehringer Ingelheim is one of the world's top 20 pharmaceutical companies, with 47,700 employees, and they have 20% time for all engineering staff. Alphabet (parent of Google) has 135,000 and has a market cap of >$1T USD, and they give employees 20% time.

[03:56:26] <Blondie101010> I'm not a soap specialist...   I mostly just rinse it off
[03:57:18] <Blondie101010> hopefully someone else can chyme in

[03:58:07] <Blondie101010> well you could start by linting your source files
[03:58:28] <SirLouen> I need some ideas on a mechanism to patch files (with a patch file) by using php code  , i've tried Google's PHP adaptation for DiffMatchPatch package but it can't simply do the job (it seems to be more appropaite for plain text scenarios without much weird symbols as a PHP file has). xdiff works great but I don't like this package (too old and
[03:58:28] <SirLouen> requires a lot of maintenance server wise). I have not found other patch-like solutions so far that are highly reliable.
[03:58:39] <Blondie101010> also make sure error reporting is set up correctly
[03:58:45] <Sammitch> grab messages from 5 and 7 and compare them
[04:03:26] <deltab> SirLouen: why are "weird symbols" a problem?
[04:10:00] <SirLouen> deltab im not sure
[04:10:07] <SirLouen> but it is constantly throwing an error
[04:12:04] <Robdgreat> what error?
[04:12:12] <Robdgreat> sorry if you said and I overlooked
[04:12:36] <SirLouen> Robdgreat  basically it can't find the pattern
[04:12:59] <SirLouen> at least a pattern generated with patch outside DiffMatchPatch
[04:13:54] <Blondie101010> are you 200% sure the current file is exactly identical to the one used for the patch?
[04:14:41] <deltab> SirLouen: are you able to show us an example?

[04:30:40] <Blondie101010> !+error reporting
[04:30:40] <php-bot> Set `error_reporting = -1` in your php.ini (to see errors on your webpage, also set `display_errors = 1`) and be sure to restart your webserver/fastcgi-listeners. Using `ini_set()` and `error_reporting()` is less reliable - for example, in the case of parse errors. See https://php.net/errorfunc.configuration or "/msg php-bot error logging" for more.
[04:31:56] <Blondie101010> if there's no log file defined for the SAPI, you should enable error_log (ini setting)

[05:18:18] <SirLouen> i have discovered the problem, this patcher thing does everything for itself
[05:18:38] <SirLouen> when you create a patch it creates an object patch
[05:19:06] <SirLouen> it's not simply an string like any other patch mechanism (like linux diff or xdiff)

[05:21:55] <Blondie101010> what format is the file?

[05:23:14] <Blondie101010> what does the file look like?
[05:23:38] <SirLouen> but briefly the problem of this is that is a self-cooked system
[05:23:42] <SirLouen> is not "universal"
[05:23:47] <Blondie101010> doesn't matter
[05:23:59] <SirLouen> xdiff is universal
[05:24:01] <Blondie101010> it still needs to be distributable
[05:24:07] <Blondie101010> otherwise a patch is POINTLESS
[05:24:11] <SirLouen> creates the exact same patch system as linux diff
[05:24:18] <SirLouen> it is distributable
[05:24:20] <deltab> there's a function to convert it to text
[05:24:25] <SirLouen> but only if you use the same saystem
[05:24:34] <Blondie101010> what do you mean?
[05:25:08] <deltab> patch_toText(patches) → text

[05:29:30] <deltab> it's showing the patch data structures, not the textual patch format
[05:29:41] <Blondie101010> obviously :)
[05:29:53] <deltab> just missing the step to convert one to the other
[05:29:58] <Blondie101010> it needs to be applied
[05:32:02] <SirLouen> it seems that it was storing in the file the patch_totext thing
[05:32:05] <SirLouen> https://paste.ofcode.org/5Zrib5sth4YQTcTs2DtryC
[05:32:15] <SirLouen> it looks a little bit like the linux diff thing
[05:32:26] <SirLouen> but is far from the real xdiff versions
[05:32:55] <SirLouen> what im wondering if there is a text_toPatch the other way around
[05:33:54] <Blondie101010> SirLouen:  looking at this, I'm wondering if you should consider making simpler to test files
[05:34:03] <Blondie101010> make real simple test cases
[05:34:44] <Blondie101010> see what causes issues
[05:34:50] <SirLouen> i've found patch_fromText method
[05:34:57] <SirLouen> maybe this may do the trick
[05:35:05] <Blondie101010> ehhhhhh
[05:35:19] <Blondie101010> SirLouen:  does that tool/lib have a manual?
[05:35:39] <SirLouen> i think i could be reading the original lib by Google
[05:35:47] *** Quits: xep (~xep@76-210-4-7.lightspeed.sntcca.sbcglobal.net) (Remote host closed the connection)
[05:35:47] <SirLouen> and the php one might have ported everythng
[05:35:51] <Blondie101010> guess they have a wiki: https://github.com/yetanotherape/diff-match-patch
[05:36:04] <SirLouen> did not conisder this, because the readme of the PHP ported one is super little
[05:36:18] <SirLouen> but deltab gave me the idea to check the other wiki
[05:36:24] <Blondie101010> sure
[05:36:31] *** Joins: xep (~xep@76-210-4-7.lightspeed.sntcca.sbcglobal.net)
[05:36:37] <deltab> SirLouen: how is the return value from patch_toText being output? something's adding quotes and "(length=89" and probably the other stuff
[05:37:11] <deltab> (percent-encoding control characters)
[05:37:27] <Blondie101010> deltab:  the reason I suggested a simple test was to eliminate confusion between the actual patch of source code with actual source code!
[05:37:35] <Blondie101010> make simple tests!
[05:38:35] <SirLouen> ok got it!
[05:38:38] <SirLouen> that was the key
[05:39:31] <SirLouen> the conversion methods between string and Patch object
[05:39:44] <SirLouen> although the string patch is horrible :P
[05:40:05] <Blondie101010> not meant to be pretty
[05:40:24] <SirLouen> the classic diff patchs are really pretty
[05:40:26] <deltab> the %09%09 stuff? something else is doing that, I think
[05:40:41] <SirLouen> yeah the %09 things
[05:40:52] <deltab> I think if you output the actual string you'll see what you expect
[05:41:24] <SirLouen> deltab which stirng? i'm outputing the patchtotext one
[05:41:46] <deltab> how? something's adding quotes and "(length=89)" and percent-encoding
[05:41:52] <SirLouen> the %09 is a TAB
[05:42:03] <SirLouen> they are all html encoding
[05:42:12] <Blondie101010> what
[05:42:21] <deltab> yes, but I suspect the string just contains a tab character there, not %09
[05:42:23] <Blondie101010> url_encode, perhaps
[05:42:29] <deltab> none of that is html encoding, btw
[05:42:34] <SirLouen> html url encoding yeah
[05:42:42] <deltab> very different things
[05:42:49] <SirLouen> no
[05:42:59] <deltab> html encoding would be &lt; &amp; etc.
[05:43:26] <deltab> url encoding is %09 %0A
[05:43:29] <SirLouen> https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/dencoder/
[05:43:35] <SirLouen> check this
[05:44:00] <Blondie101010> that is one function call
[05:44:01] <deltab> I see "URL Encoder" in big letters
[05:44:36] <SirLouen> deltab https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.asp
[05:44:40] <Blondie101010> !+urlencode
[05:44:40] <php-bot> string urlencode ( string $str )  - URL-encodes string - http://php.net/urlencode
[05:44:44] <deltab> no html encoding there at all
[05:45:01] <SirLouen> HTML URL Encoding Reference
[05:45:32] <deltab> uh, yeah, w3schools is not a good reference
[05:45:48] <SirLouen> it doesnt matter
[05:46:00] <SirLouen> the thing here is that is outputting url enconding as i see for the string
[05:46:04] <deltab> they've just stuck "HTML" on the front of various things
[05:46:18] <deltab> "HTML language codes" are just language codes
[05:46:25] <SirLouen> the only thing i could do is use urldecode and encode
[05:46:31] <deltab> "HTML country codes" are just country codes
[05:46:35] <SirLouen> to use something more random
[05:46:44] <SirLouen> still the headers will never match
[05:46:53] <SirLouen> so i don't thing it is a great idea
[05:47:10] <Sammitch> what is the actual problem? you all seem to be way off in the weeds
[05:47:20] <deltab> SirLouen: you have something else happening: find it and eliminate it
[05:47:44] * Blondie101010 nods
[05:47:45] <SirLouen> you think that the url encoding is due to something?
[05:47:47] <deltab> Sammitch: SirLouen seems to be confusing debug output for the actual value of a string
[05:48:08] <Blondie101010> that fits what I read so far
[05:48:20] <deltab> this: https://paste.ofcode.org/5Zrib5sth4YQTcTs2DtryC
[05:48:47] <deltab> SirLouen: what command do you use to output that?
[05:48:47] <Blondie101010> it's showing a patch of a var_dump it looks like
[05:49:00] <SirLouen> deltab is the var dump of wordpress
[05:49:27] <Blondie101010> show some code, at least that line
[05:49:50] <deltab> okay, so output is without the vardump
[05:50:12] <SirLouen> $file_content = file_get_contents( $originalfile );
[05:50:12] <SirLouen> $copy_file_content = file_get_contents( $copy_file );
[05:50:12] <SirLouen> $patch_text = $patch_object->patch_make( $file_content, $copy_file_content );
[05:50:17] <SirLouen> it is super strainght forward
[05:50:29] <deltab> no, the line that outputs it
[05:50:37] <SirLouen> i var_dump ($patch_text)
[05:50:49] <deltab> change that to echo
[05:51:02] <Blondie101010> no
[05:51:11] <Blondie101010> that is not a var_dump
[05:51:57] *** Quits: pmercado (~pmercado@186.107.36.19) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[05:52:36] <SirLouen> its an array
[05:53:03] <deltab> dump the string "\t" -- what do you get?
[05:53:46] <Blondie101010> I would expect `$patch_text` to contain a textual definition, not an array of objects
[05:54:10] <Blondie101010> again, please consult their documentation
[05:54:30] <SirLouen> i put patch_text because i though it was a string :P
[05:54:43] <deltab> Blondie101010: that's the dump of the string, followed by the dump of the object array
[05:54:44] <SirLouen> because the original docs were extremely little and it looked like a string
[05:55:07] <SirLouen> deltab yeah, I've copy pasted the two dumps
[05:55:08] <deltab> oh, I see, misleading variable name
[05:55:29] <SirLouen> the first dump is the string, and the second dump is the Patch object array
[05:56:02] <SirLouen> but as you see in my simple code, there is no fancy elements that suggest the patch string should look in a different way
[05:56:06] <Blondie101010> show me how to get that var_dump output :)
[05:56:55] <SirLouen> var_dump ($patch_object->patch_toText($patch_text)); ==> STRING
[05:56:55] <SirLouen> var_dump ($patch_text); ===> ARRAY
[05:58:08] <Blondie101010> I'm trying to clarify this...  https://3v4l.org/GMU9L
[05:58:32] <deltab> that's some replacement var_dump then, because the standard one produces output like this:
[05:58:35] <deltab> php > var_dump("foo\tbar");
[05:58:37] <deltab> string(7) "foo  bar"
[05:59:15] * Blondie101010 nods
[06:00:01] <SirLouen> but be aware that the string doesnt only appear in the var_dump output
[06:00:15] <SirLouen> also if i do a file_put_contents the same string appear in the created file
[06:00:35] <SirLouen> maybe this is the string they generate
[06:00:42] <SirLouen> they simply generate the patches this way
[06:01:20] <Blondie101010> what does the first file look like?
[06:01:35] <SirLouen> it is a classic php file
[06:01:46] <deltab> okay, sorry, I do see that in the documentation
[06:02:05] <SirLouen> what have you seen?
[06:02:13] <SirLouen> could be perfectly this php file: https://github.com/yetanotherape/diff-match-patch/blob/master/src/Diff.php
[06:02:43] <Blondie101010> what are you doing?
[06:02:49] <SirLouen> im testing with a random php file
[06:02:57] <Blondie101010> test with a SIMPLE file
[06:04:06] <deltab> https://web.archive.org/web/20161002083301/https://code.google.com/p/google-diff-match-patch/wiki/Unidiff
[06:04:59] <SirLouen> ok deltab now everything makes sense
[06:05:11] <SirLouen> my fucking life xD
[06:07:03] <SirLouen> Special characters are encoded using %xx notation. The set of characters which are encoded matches JavaScript's encodeURI() function, with the exception of spaces which are not encoded.
[06:07:39] <SirLouen> this seems to be the main difference with unidiff
[06:07:40] <deltab> the formatting in https://github.com/google/diff-match-patch/wiki/Unidiff is messed up (due to the conversion to github, I expect) and I gave up on reading it too soon
[06:08:36] <SirLouen> yeah
[06:08:45] <SirLouen> well i think i will be fine with this format
[06:09:01] <SirLouen> i will only have to create some generators
[06:09:06] <deltab> you can make your own converter if needed
[06:09:35] <SirLouen> because it was simpler for me to do the patchs straight on linux
[06:09:48] <SirLouen> now i will have to create some scripts to generate this kind of patches
[06:10:03] <Blondie101010> why not use the tools you already know?
[06:10:54] <Blondie101010> I see no reason to do that
[06:10:56] <SirLouen> i could also create a converter but the only problem is analysing how the start and lenght keys are being generated
[06:11:22] * deltab nods
[06:12:06] <deltab> points 1 and 3, the character-based offsets and rolling context
[06:13:20] <SirLouen> deltab converting lines to characters
[06:13:22] <deltab> you'd have to count the number of line breaks in a substring, and update an offset as you go, I think
[06:13:27] <SirLouen> too much for today xD
[06:13:36] <deltab> oh, yeah
[06:13:47] <SirLouen> its 100% doable
[06:13:53] <SirLouen> but too much of a hassle for today
[06:13:58] <deltab> yep
[06:14:43] <SirLouen> i think im going to bed now. more steps tomorrow towards my super-patching system goal :P

[14:13:55] <teresko> ... asks a question, exists 9 minutes latere
[14:40:07] <Koopz> any suggestions for malware scanners?
[14:40:17] <teresko> linux?
[14:40:30] <Koopz> anything, for php code
[14:40:41] <TinoDidriksen> git
[14:41:04] <Koopz> i'm about to move a website to one of our servers and would like to check this thing before actually hosting it
[14:41:09] <teresko> quickest way to remove php-related mallware is to delete wordpress
[14:41:22] <Koopz> it's not even a wordpress
[14:41:28] <Koopz> unfortunately
[14:41:40] <TinoDidriksen> Seriously, version control. "git diff" or "git status" will show anything out of order.
[14:41:41] <Koopz> then that would've been an easy solution
[14:41:46] <teresko> I have no idea what you are actually asking about
[14:42:03] <teresko> Koopz: can you please try explaining WHAT you are trying to do?
[14:42:11] <Naktibalda> Koopz: have you tried to google?
[14:42:14] <Koopz> 🤔
[14:42:16] <Koopz> i did
[14:42:27] <Koopz> and i stumbled upon this cool thing called RIPS
[14:42:34] <TinoDidriksen> If it's not in version control, then compare against whatever version it was installed from.
[14:42:35] <Koopz> it even supports, hold on to your chairs

[14:42:55] <teresko> please stop trolling
[14:43:13] <Koopz> i kid you not
[14:43:34] <SirLouen> you shall migrate that site
[14:43:48] <Koopz> alright then i'll grep the folder for uh... "eval("

[14:44:10] <teresko> where did you find it? burried in a time capsule ?
[14:44:10] <Koopz> manually
[14:44:14] <TinoDidriksen> He didn't say the site was 3.4 - just that the scanner tool supported 3.4.

[14:44:42] <teresko> well, he's not making much sens any way you look at it
[14:44:47] <Koopz> am i not?
[14:44:48] <TinoDidriksen> Sure he is.
[14:45:00] <SirLouen> teresko what is kind of funny is that my site was 10 times more robust than a regular updated WP
[14:45:26] <SirLouen> my client told me that he did not had any updates for around 15 years, just standing there with 200 visits per day
[14:45:44] <TinoDidriksen> Containers are also useful. You can put the site in a non-root container that only allows inbound connections. That way any potential malware can't do much.
[14:45:54] <teresko> that's impressive in a very terrifying way, SirLouen
[14:46:10] <SirLouen> I think it was 4.4 or something
[14:46:28] <SirLouen> done around 2007-2008
[14:46:40] <teresko> partially saved because all of the current hacks are not compatible with it anymore :D
[14:47:20] <SirLouen> the problem is that wordpress is tooo much susceptible to hacks
[14:47:28] <Koopz> well i don't really expect to find anything in this folder called "2016" either considering the CMS system is so obscure no script kiddie would've bothered finding vulns
[14:47:34] <SirLouen> in february almost 50% of my wordpress based sites have been hacked in oneway or another
[14:47:38] <Koopz> but better safe than sorry
[14:47:50] <teresko> SirLouen: partially it's due tue supply-and-demand
[14:48:12] <SirLouen> Koopz strange, php 4 was launched in 2000 it's kind of weird its on 3.X
[14:49:34] <Koopz> i never said the website was using 3.4
[14:49:45] <Koopz> RIPS 0.55 was 3.4
[14:50:11] <teresko> I need a beer
[14:50:34] <Naktibalda> maybe it meant PHP 3-4

[22:59:24] <relipse>  I'm getting a PDO error, but I don't know why: You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MariaDB server version for the right syntax to use near ':route AND direction_id = :direction AND service_id LIKE :service_id' at line 2 https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/KeBYFUdR/sql
[23:00:47] <__adrian> what's the code look like
[23:01:19] <ordos> relipse, you'll need to enclose the LIKE'd bit in % symbols

[23:01:54] <relipse> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/rsy1smnn/
[23:02:07] <relipse> there is my code
[23:02:21] <relipse> prepared and executed
[23:02:27] *** Joins: cwchristerw (~cwchriste@onyx.devices.christerwaren.fi)
[23:02:35] <relipse> oh nevermind
[23:02:39] <relipse> there is no parameter in execute
[23:02:54] <AllenJB> You can use CONCAT with LIKE and prepared queries. eg. LIKE CONCAT('%', :term, '%')
[23:03:05] <relipse> oh cool thanks Allen
[23:03:28] <Rockwood> Northwoods, hi
[23:03:46] <Northwoods> Hi :)
[23:03:59] <Rockwood> not sleeping ?
[23:04:39] <AllenJB> o_O @ `service_id` which can apparently contain one or more ids or the string "Weekday" - smells like you're using 1 column for multiple purposes / data to me.
[23:05:51] *** Quits: hh (~g@37.214.40.201) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:07:09] <relipse> it's hard to explain Allen
[23:07:16] <AllenJB> Related: Be aware that LIKE with a wildcard at the front cannot use indexes and as such may cause performance issues (assuming you've got an appropriate multi-column index in the first place)
[23:07:20] <relipse> but basically thats how the data was exported

[23:45:43] <TML> AllenJB: Why on earth would you instruct someone to do CONCAT('%', :term, '%')?
[23:45:51] <TML> Just put the %'s in :term
[23:46:12] <TML> $db = new PDO('pgsql:host=localhost;dbname=joey'); $stmt = $db->prepare('select * from t where b like :b'); $b = $stmt->execute(['%foo%']); var_dump($stmt->fetchAll()); // works just fine
[23:46:40] <TinoDidriksen> It's sometimes much easier to CONCAT
[23:46:47] <TML> TinoDidriksen: How so?
[23:46:47] <__adrian> likely because user input.
[23:47:13] <__adrian> actaully no - nevermind.
[23:47:47] *** Quits: PTNapivoski (~PTNapivos@179.189.133.33) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:48:18] <TinoDidriksen> If you need the PHP variables for anything else later, then CONCAT saves a few lines.
[23:48:24] <TML> Hmm
[23:48:27] <TML> OK

[23:48:42] <TML> So you want to see the PHP value *without* the %'s on it somewhere

[23:49:23] <TML> __adrian: Yeah, but TinoDidriksen did a good enough job of coming up with a scenario I hadn't considered that I'm willing to concede the point :)
[23:49:28] <znf> Not having much luck in #nginx, so I'll ask here too, maybe someone has some insight
[23:50:06] <__adrian> the reasons i've done it in the past were that i wanted to escape the input (so extra _% couldn't be added)
[23:50:07] <znf> in regards to X-Accel-Buffering, if the script sends X-Accel-Buffering: No, can you still somehow buffer the output when PHP is used via php-fpm?
[23:50:12] <TML> TinoDidriksen: Still feels weird, though :)
[23:50:18] <__adrian> but i could have done what i just said in that case too
[23:50:27] <znf> I remember doing it at a point, but I can't recall how
[23:51:07] <TML> znf: ob_start()?
[23:51:10] *** Quits: Rockwood (~Rocky@user/rocky) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[23:51:36] <znf> Would that force fastcgi_buffering?
[23:51:37] <TinoDidriksen> I have also used CONCAT for searches like SELECT :verbatim UNION SELECT CONCAT(:verbatim, '%') UNION  SELECT CONCAT('%', :verbatim) to order the results as "best first"
[23:52:00] *** Quits: acxty (~acxty___@65.182.6.90) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[23:52:19] <TML> znf: No, but that'd be a way to buffer regardless of what nginx says
[23:52:30] <TML> TinoDidriksen: Gross :)
[23:52:41] <znf> reason I'm asking -- I have a slightly large file being generated, that takes almost no CPU and ideally it doesn't really take long to generate, but because the users' download speed is /slooooow/ as hell, it keeps my php-fpm child busy for 15-20s
[23:54:55] <TML> TinoDidriksen: That must be a MySQL trick, because most of the RDBMS' I use won't assure the ordering of UNIONs
[23:55:06] <__adrian> TinoDidriksen: booooo you're using emulated prepares
[23:55:48] <TinoDidriksen> Not emulated - yes it needs multiple names, stupidly enough. Gods I really hate that part.
[23:56:28] <__adrian> well :named params aren't real, so ...  :)

[23:57:56] <TinoDidriksen> But there is no reason PDO can't support multi-use even without emulation.
[23:58:16] <__adrian> i'll agree that's probably ture, but haven't looked at the code.
[23:58:20] <__adrian> *true
