[01:28:52] <anton> Hello, I saw in CONTRIBUTING.md that "All code submitted must be licensed under [Modified BSD] or more-permissive terms (2-clause BSD, MIT, ISC, etc.)." Does this also apply to forks? I have a few customizations in mind for my use, and I would really prefer a free software license over one of the "permissive" ones. Would this be allowed? Thanks in advance!

[01:48:54] <wink> the AGPL is horrible. and that's all I will say.
[01:48:56] <ngoldbaum> even RMS says BSD is a free software license
[01:49:04] <bkero> I think we all know the differences between 'open source' and 'free software' here.
[01:49:34] <anton> I'm not that big a fan of the permissive licenses though
[01:49:41] <kline> thats nice?
[01:49:58] <riv> why not?
[01:50:04] <riv> they provide the four software freedoms
[01:50:37] <riv> and i dont think redefining words just because you prefer to use something else makes any sense
[01:50:38] <anton> yes, but you can release permissive software as binary only.
[01:50:46] <anton> Take a look at https://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.html
[01:50:46] <mockturtle> [ About the GNU Project
[01:50:46] <mockturtle> - GNU Project - Free Software Foundation ] - www.gnu.org
[01:51:10] <kline> anton, are you suggesting that lobsters be relicensed or what
[01:51:19] <kline> im unsure where this is supposed to be going
[01:51:41] <ngoldbaum> for philosophical reasons they want to add to the lobsters codebase under the gpl
[01:51:47] <anton> it would be nice if it were copyleft, but I'm just responding to riv for the moment
[01:52:08] <ngoldbaum> given that they have no control over upstream, they’ll do it in a fork
[01:52:20] <ngoldbaum> kinda useless thing to do in practice but there you go
[01:52:24] <anton> "[...] Developed at MIT, and released as free software with a permissive license, it was soon adopted by various computer companies. They added X to their proprietary Unix systems, in binary form only, and covered by the same nondisclosure agreement [...]"
[01:52:35] <anton> couldn't this happen to lobste.rs's software?
[01:52:43] <ngoldbaum> it’s a webapp
[01:52:45] <ngoldbaum> so no
[01:53:34] <bkero> Some people don't care about having requirements that users should contribute back to the commons.
[01:54:25] <kline> the GPL doesnt even require that
[01:54:32] <kline> it only mandates you to give to your users
[01:54:49] <bkero> In the majority of cases those end up being the same thing.
[01:54:58] <kline> in our community, sure
[01:55:00] <riv> the source code of lobsters is on githb
[01:55:03] <bkero> In the world
[01:55:06] <kline> maybe not with things like rhel
[01:55:36] <bkero> Have you looked through rpm source repos of rhel packages?
[01:55:37] <kline> anyway, when talking about licenses you should really talk about common convention or practicality, but what the license actually mandates and allows
[01:55:53] <kline> GPL does not require you to give back to the commons, full stop
[01:56:09] <ngoldbaum> yeah, only if you yourself redistribute it
[01:56:25] <anton> yeah, isn't that something AGPL solved?
[01:56:26] <bkero> We all know that
[01:56:28] <kline> anton, no
[01:56:37] <anton> it solved some things though :)
[01:56:47] <kline> anton, the AGPL was about saas
[01:57:02] <ngoldbaum> it made google and apple employees allergic to certain codebases yes
[01:57:10] <kline> in which some people were considered not to have the software distributed to them and therfore not require source code
[01:57:35] <kline> AGPL clears it up to really be about users, not simply recipients of distributions of your software
[01:57:52] <kline> ie no saas loophole where you keep the software locally and people use it over a link
[01:58:46] <JordiGH> <epilys> seems like a matrix transpose + popcnt and check if the sum of 1s is more than half
[01:58:48] <kline> agpl still doesnt force you to give changes to the commons, only your users - so if your software was behind a paywall, then only those that pay and are users have to get access to the code, and theres nothing saying you have to give the code to anyone but there
[01:58:52] <JordiGH> I did column means and rounded.
[01:59:19] <bkero> Once you give it to your users they're free to make it available as well.
[01:59:21] <JordiGH> And 1 - rounded_column_means gives you the complement.
[01:59:45] <kline> bkero, yes, but when was the last time you received source code with your software and redistributed it yourself?
[02:00:02] <bkero> kline: This year. Hardware.
[02:00:02] <ngoldbaum> if it’s an AGPL webapp that i’m self-hosting?
[02:00:07] <ngoldbaum> every time i run it?
[02:00:15] <kline> bkero, what do you mean hardware
[02:00:24] <bkero> kline: Ubiquiti GPL archive dumps.
[02:00:35] <kline> oh sure
[02:00:37] <bkero> They just upload zip files of source code for u-boot and the linux kernel.
[02:00:41] <bkero> I restribute it.
[02:00:45] <kline> thanks
[02:00:46] <bkero> redistribute*
[02:00:46] <JordiGH> You only have to give access to the source code of the AGPL app to people who are using the app. You can restrict who those people are with an authwall.
[02:00:47] <kline> thats good stuff
[02:00:50] <kline> rare though
[02:01:02] <bkero> All of this ends up being redistributed
[02:01:10] <bkero> sometimes it's off in a niche corner though
[02:01:18] <bkero> Which is why I'm saying it's de facto commons
[02:01:35] <bkero> Thanks to that particular software freedom
[02:01:49] <ngoldbaum> the dark web
[02:01:55] <anton> For a while now I've just found it a bit weird to use permissive licenses, where you could just end up writing someone's proprietary software (or Software as a Service / Service as a Software Substitute) for them

[22:39:32] <ngoldbaum> also it’s unfortunate the newfangled stuff was hamstrung because of back compay concerns
[22:40:22] <ngoldbaum> someone just needs to write the One Correct Language that will never go out of fashion and turn out to have major design flaws
[22:40:24] <ngoldbaum> easy right
[22:40:44] <gerikson> hello Perl exists
[22:41:44] <pe> Exactly.
[22:41:59] <gwozniak> People saying that we should take the UB out of C are the kind of people wishing for magic pixie dust to fix tech issues
[22:42:20] <gwozniak> C is going to have UB forever.  We're better off not using it
[22:42:59] <gwozniak> And yeah, I'm guessing UB will always be around in some form since there are so many different hardware archs around
[22:43:34] <ngoldbaum> gerikson: even perl got raku’d

[22:44:45] <pe> CVEs don't matter.
[22:45:03] <pe> The community has degraded their meaning enough.
[22:45:16] <gerikson> ngoldbaum: I'm seeing Raku solutions for AoC and they might as well be APL ;)
[22:45:27] <gwozniak> Here's another problem: lots of people writing C code don't know much about it.  They use it because of inertia
[22:45:42] <gerikson> j/k but I do think Raku peeled off the Lisp-curious from Perl, leaving the sysadmin better-than-sh crowd
[22:45:53] <gwozniak> I had to deal with some such people in the past few weeks
[22:45:54] <gerikson> gwozniak: that is the bigger problem I believe
[22:46:00] <ngoldbaum> did raku take all the code golfers?
[22:46:19] <gerikson> honestly dunno
[22:46:34] <ngoldbaum> i guess so if people are doing AOC in it
[22:46:44] <pe> I use C mostly because it's more convenient than all the other choices I have.

[22:57:26] <companion_cube> sure, and why would anyone start a new webserver in C?
[22:57:32] <pe> For monoliths it might not matter, but when I want to make a bunch of binaries, I don't want /each and every one of them/ to be 10 megs.
[22:57:58] <ngoldbaum> companion_cube: because they want to spew the contents of memory randomly onto random webpages like cloudflare that one time

[23:00:22] <companion_cube> in C too you have to be careful with everything

[23:05:32] <companion_cube> if it's good enough for trading, I doubt so
[23:05:46] <technomancy> java is resource intensive and slow to start up, not slow at runtime
[23:06:11] <companion_cube> you can write really fast C

[23:08:13] <gwozniak> C has this speed thing associated with it, but recently we had a customer complain bitterly about code size.  We found out that turing on the optimizer "broke their app" and so they refuse to do it, but still claim that we should get code size down (and performance up)

[23:20:01] <gwozniak> ngoldbaum: adding new benchmarks is fine because they barely test anything most of the time.  The problem is the set of options is basically static so if they have not very good choices, then you have to walk a tightrope
[23:21:17] <gwozniak> The thing about embedded benchmarks is that they capture so little of the systems you are targeting
[23:22:12] <gwozniak> So running them is mostly useless.  Maybe the floating point tests are worth running, but most embedded stuff our customers write is event-driven, interrupt stuff
[23:24:42] <gwozniak> Just yesterday I spent a ton of time debugging some benchmarks, trying to figure out why the resulting binaries were either absurdly large or absurdly small.  It turned out the linker scripts weren't pointing at the correct entry point, so if you didn't use --gc-sections to the linker you got a huge binary, but if you did you got a tiny one with no functional code in it

[23:33:59] <pe> rb: isn't the creator's programming style to constantly keep making new languages?
[23:34:09] <rb> ouch
[23:34:14] <pe> :D
[23:36:21] <pe> I know I felt like making one a few times already.
[23:37:34] <rb> i'm trying to make one but the object heap integration is kicking my ass
[23:38:05] <rb> i'm down to method and block activations and primitives
[23:40:45] <rb> hmm maybe i should have a pool of tracked heap objects, there shouldn't be too many of them at the same time methinks... maybe if i set a reasonable amount it would Just Work
[23:40:59] <rb> right now it's all disjointed allocations which kind of defeats the purpose of the object heap
[23:42:27] <pe> I might need to learn Nigel Tao's Wuffs.
[23:43:05] <pe> He's got something partially verified, but it has his signature overengineering.
[23:44:19] <rb> what's that?

[23:48:17] <pe> Given that I've written a JPEG parser, and a TIFF parser recently.
[23:48:34] <pe> And ICC profile parser.
[23:48:46] <pe> It's really annoying.

[23:56:06] <pe> Today I've learnt that my Nikon DSLR creates rather huge previews in its JPEGs, in MFP format, making it a JPEG with two TIFFs, where one of the TIFFs contains another JPEG, and the other points to two other additional ones.
[23:57:11] <pe> Of course, the additional JPEGs also contain their own TIFFs (also known as Exif).
