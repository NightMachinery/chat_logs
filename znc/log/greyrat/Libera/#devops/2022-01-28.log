[20:26:32] <slaughter> (cross post) Anyone have any fun links or thoughts on operationalizing documentation? IE best practices, thoughts on systems, rules and regulations, whatever it may be as long as it's related to documentation
[20:55:57] <kwilczynski> Fun?
[20:55:59] <kwilczynski> Documentation?
[20:56:07] <kwilczynski> In the same sentence?
[20:56:25] <kwilczynski> slaughter: Sir, are you in trouble and want to let us secretly know?
[20:56:35] <kwilczynski> slaughter: WINK WINK, we'll send someone to rescue you.
[20:57:03] <obviyus> thought exercise: why would someone want to package a jar file inside a docker container?
[20:57:36] <obviyus> with something like Nomad, you can orchestrate jar files, do you gain anything by containerising?
[20:57:48] <obviyus> unless you’re running multiple versions of jre…
[21:02:51] *** Quits: shad (~shad@user/shad) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[21:03:29] <kwilczynski> obviyus: You want to ship pre-package JDK of your choice with some custom malloc and perhaps other JNIs somewhat easier than having to deal with managing multiple dependencies on the underlying OS.
[21:03:36] <kwilczynski> obviyus: Perhaps.
[21:03:56] <kwilczynski> obviyus: Nowadays there are many ways to look at container images and what they can bring.
[21:04:14] <kwilczynski> Perhaps someone wanted to have the potential isolation a container turned process can have?
[21:04:17] <kwilczynski> etc, etc.
[21:05:18] <obviyus> fair enough, that makes sense to me
[21:05:44] <kwilczynski>  Yeah.
[21:06:02] <kwilczynski> In 2022 we should forget about the original ideas pertaining to a container.
[21:06:22] <kwilczynski> Because if definitely became a way to do all sorts of things.
[21:06:22] <kwilczynski> :)
[21:06:38] <kwilczynski> s/ideas/ideals/
[21:06:41] <kwilczynski> Rather.
[21:06:59] <obviyus> : )
[21:07:10] <kwilczynski> If you think about it. OS does not really care how you produce your software and where it's run from.
[21:07:33] <kwilczynski> As long as it can load the image from the storage and turn it into a PCB (a process) and execute it.
[21:08:01] <kwilczynski> The sheer fact that your process needs libraries, shared objects, configuration files, needs to make sockets, do a network connection, etc. It's irrelevant.
[21:08:15] <kwilczynski> From the OS point of view.
[21:09:03] <kwilczynski> obviyus: That that's obvious, isn't it Mister? :)
[21:09:06] <slaughter> kwilczynski I'd like it to be fun in the end, but yeah those aren't words that normally go together ;)
[21:09:17] * kwilczynski takes a bad stab at obviyus' nickname :P
[21:09:48] <slaughter> I'm pretty interested in the documentation side of things, and trying to build out some ideas for standardization in my next job
[21:09:57] <kwilczynski> slaughter: No. So next time if you are in trouble, then just mention that you love maintaining documentation in Jira for fun.
[21:10:14] <kwilczynski> slaughter: We'll know you are kidnapped by someone who is about to harvest your organs and such.
[21:11:14] <slaughter> Hahahaha part of this writeup I'm doing is "and here's 2838429348923 reasons you shouldn't use confluence"
[21:11:25] * slaughter hates Confluence
[21:12:01] <kwilczynski> I detest Atlassian with pride and passion...
[21:12:05] <kwilczynski> They fucked up Trello so badly...
[21:12:08] * kwilczynski shakes fist
[21:12:35] <slaughter> I think JIRA is a great tool when it's not been taken over and fucked up by overeager PMs, but yeah Atlassian in general sucks
[21:13:03] <slaughter> If I was starting fresh I'd probably look to Github's project management tools instead of JIRA
[21:13:43] <rawtaz> i used jira once for a couple of weeks. i foudn the UX was shit. they simply havent understood how users use the app or what users need to do in a system like that. it s not even close to intuitive. it's like retarded fish had designed the UX
[21:14:36] <obviyus> kwilczynski: i suppose it is :)
[21:15:40] <slaughter> rawtaz that's a pretty spot on assessment. It's improved quite a bit in the last few years, but really it relies on familiarity more than UX in virtually every aspect
[21:15:46] <rawtaz> ah ok
[21:15:58] <slaughter> Once you know how JIRA works, it's a very sufficient tool for the job
[21:15:58] <rawtaz> yeah this was i guess 2-3 years ago
[21:16:08] <rawtaz> hmm ok
[21:16:13] <rawtaz> i hope i never learn that :D
[21:16:15] <slaughter> But even with the current improvements if you don't already know how it works, you're boned
[21:16:25] <rawtaz> but i dont kow what other tool there is thats good
[21:16:31] <slaughter> And even if you learn it, it's so customizable and PMs need to justify their existence so much that they turn it into a shit salad
[21:16:37] <rawtaz> lol
[21:17:07] <slaughter> Honestly my favorite kanban experience of my life was with a whiteboard and sticky notes
[21:17:19] <kwilczynski> obviyus: <3
[21:17:34] <slaughter> That was a 2 person team, though, so the context on tickets didn't need to be explicitly spelled out 
[21:17:56] <kwilczynski> " And even if you learn it, it's so customizable and PMs need to justify their existence so much that they turn it into a shit salad"
[21:17:58] <kwilczynski> This ^
[21:18:18] <kwilczynski> I worked for a small German startup recently on a short stint contract.
[21:18:29] <kwilczynski> Everything the team did as self-guiding team was working OK.
[21:18:43] <kwilczynski> Then the newly appointed manager decided that we need a PM and a Agile Coach.
[21:18:54] <kwilczynski> Suffice to say... everything went to shit from there.
[21:18:54] <kwilczynski> :)
[21:19:23] <kwilczynski> I feel sorry, really sorry for the FTEs that are left behind whom have to put up with that sort of level of utter retardation.
[21:19:41] <kwilczynski> Fuck me. I love being self-employed.
[21:19:42] <kwilczynski> :)
[21:20:26] <slaughter> I've seen that same situation play out, never great
[21:20:35] <slaughter> Agile Coach lmao
[21:21:07] <slaughter> AKA "I read the manifesto and forgot 3/4 of it but here's a blog post from some SEO-heavy company that validates my feelings so let's make more processes!"
[21:27:06] <rawtaz> kwilczynski: theres a HUGE misconception though. and its complete bullshit. the notion or assumption that FTEs *have* to e.g. put up with that sort of level of utter retardation.
[21:27:21] <rawtaz> if you work at a company that sucks, you quit and do something at a better place
[21:28:23] <rawtaz> im so extremely tired of all this "businesses have to do <some wrong thing here> because of shareholders revenue expectations" and "people have to follow company guidelines because thats the policy" and so on. if something is wrong, either you fix it, or you do the right thing, or you quite and move on. staying and doing the wrong thing is not an option.
[21:31:29] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: Often people do, sadly, put up with it... as they might be trapped. For instance, having to spent an entire year in such environment to not be then marked as "job hopper", or being stuck because one has mortgage to pay or medical bills (more U.S. specific).
[21:32:06] <rawtaz> morale, ethics, the right thing and common sense is above that stuff.
[21:32:15] <rawtaz> medical bills is one exception though
[21:32:33] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: I didn't say people won't leave or that they should/should't not... it's just harder for a lot of people in FTE positions to have this sort of mobility.
[21:33:00] <rawtaz> then they should try harder (except those that have a severe life situation, but thats far from everyone)
[21:33:08] <kwilczynski> :)
[21:33:21] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: Imagine. It's also different across cultures.
[21:33:34] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: In Japan, there is this notion of having to change job every 7 years.
[21:33:38] <rawtaz> theres *sooooooooooooooooooooooooooo* many people who just sit there and contribute to insanity instead of setting down a foot and saying "this isnt okay, and im not supporting it" and IF NEED BE switch to another workplace
[21:33:46] <kwilczynski> (the country which has the highest rate of suicides too)
[21:33:58] <rawtaz> bbiaw, making dinner :)
[21:34:02] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: Oh yes.
[21:34:04] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: Enjoy!
