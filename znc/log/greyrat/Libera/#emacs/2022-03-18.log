See, these lines of code https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mssql/blob/88319a61a06e27fc1d3ea2e7b853ec1692b4c166/lsp-mssql.el#L149-L164
[01:59:04] <parsnip> ah, dang
[01:59:06] <sebboh> ...declare the type (I guess, right?) and declare the variable.. but the default value also gives the "mismatch" message.  I tried removing the single quote, then I remembered that I don't know basic syntax of elisp. :)
[01:59:24] <bpalmer> But they do produce some research and they're a big step above something like the Claremont Institute

[02:12:44] <sebboh> bpalmer, maybe the author originally intended to put more code in the define-widget invocation.  I notice that it does not contain the word "database" for example, so it's not like the "restriction" is going to force me to give it only valid values.
[02:14:35] <bpalmer> sebboh: so, I'm pretty sure the code should not have the initial quote in it (['(1 2 3)] is the same as [(quote (1 2 3))] ; vector literals quote their contents, even though both match the validation of (and (vectorp _) (seq-every-p #'listp _))
[02:15:43] <bpalmer> but that's not enough to get rid of the mismatch
[02:16:17] <parsnip> this is not the person i want to learn about communism from. his voice just drones on, there's maybe a condescending voice, this guy has a variant of little man's syndrome, or "i live in a small town"
[02:16:49] <parsnip> not compelling
[02:16:58] <bpalmer> a lot to take in from a voice.
[02:17:35] <parsnip> don't they say, presentation is everything? well, sometimes even i agree with that
[02:18:03] <sebboh> Right, I tried removing the ' because the README shows an example value which does not include it.  But I still get "mismatch".  Yep, exactly.  What if I abandon the variable and just invoke lsp-mssql-connect with an argument or something.  It is defined here: https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mssql/blob/88319a61a06e27fc1d3ea2e7b853ec1692b4c166/lsp-mssql.el#L394-L405

[07:20:25] <sm> hey all. My flycheck errors are always obscured by "Next locus from FILE" in the message area, until I move point away and back to the error location. Isn't this driving you insane ? How did you fix it ?
[07:23:36] <bpalmer> I don't use flycheck myself ; that's how I deal with things.
[07:23:42] <bpalmer> But you could check out, perhaps, flycheck-pos-tip
[07:23:54] <bpalmer> https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck-pos-tip
[07:24:55] <bpalmer> I don't think that will help in terminal frames, but in a GUI, you'll get the error as a tooltip instead.

[07:54:15] <bpalmer> Hmm. Did I make this up? I might have.
[07:54:38] <bpalmer> at any rate. Man pages don't contain the metadata that makes good info pages.
[07:55:00] <bpalmer> if you're just looking for a better interface to reading the man pages, you might try M-x woman RET
[07:55:48] <gnoo> yeah, i like the way info has a toc at the front and you can see what topic lies overall in the document
[07:57:54] <sm> well, this flycheck "locus" UX issue happens in GUI emacs too
[07:58:14] <johns> I'm sure pandoc can do it
[07:58:25] <sm> the colours are nicer, I will say. But of course, the font is worse.
[08:00:50] * sm realises you absolutely may not have a differently-coloured underline in terminal emacs 
[08:02:30] <sm> could I configure flycheck's overlay to override the mode's usual highlighting faces ? Perhaps by fiddling with its priority ?

[08:09:00] <wgreenhouse> both are good, in different usecases

[08:15:19] <sm> ok.. that's what I meant.. isn't that daemon mode ?
[08:15:39] <sm> wrong terminology perhaps
[08:16:36] <bpalmer> there's a separate flag you can use when starting emacs, --daemon, such that you can *only* connect using emacsclient to get anything done.

[08:59:51] <bpalmer> Sorry that it happened to you.
[09:00:36] <bpalmer> You should be careful, though; generally speaking, "shopkeepers" are able to detain someone they suspect of shoplifting until the police arrive
[09:02:01] <bpalmer> Since this has escalated, you may want to go during the daylight hours and complain about the person to a store manager
[09:03:16] <bpalmer> But no idea if there are consequences to you just leaving while they're summoning the cops, other than possibly the store exacting its own consequence and, e.g., forbidding you entrance.
[09:03:50] <bpalmer> This is why I'd suggest complaining to a store manager, getting your side of the story out there, so that you don't find yourself denied that grocery store in the future.

[09:14:23] <parsnip> That's why I gestured that I was leaving, to make sure I wasn't going to be tackled. I should have verbalized it thought.
[09:14:57] <parsnip> Yeah, I'm writing long note in to grocery store contact form, will keep a copy of text.
[09:15:27] <parsnip> Like, I even used my "grocery store identifier" during purchase, presumably they can look that up.
[09:15:53] <parsnip> What I don't want to do, is deal with this all verbally. That's pretty much my reason for telling them to call police. I didn't really want to let the accusation slide.

[09:16:24] <parsnip> You want to accuse me, do it formally.
[09:16:43] <parsnip> If police had stopped me, I wasn't going to say anything. Just, "am I being detained".
[09:17:16] <parsnip> They would have found the receipt in my backpack.
[09:18:52] <parsnip> They didn't help me at all when someone used my card at their store. As far as I'm concerned, they're the crooks they're looking for.

[14:28:12] <edgar-rft> wonko-the-sane: If you only know the current emement you can traverse the "ring" (list) from the firt element until you find the current element, while simultaneously keeping a pointer to the previou element. As soon as the current element is found you return the previous element. It's pretty overcomplicated but the only way I know with the current emacs "ring" implementation.

[17:47:27] <pjb> Bayes: you could use TODO entries for your questions, tagged with :ask: or something.
[17:47:39] <pjb> Bayes: then you can easily extract the TODOs and filter on the tag.
[17:47:50] <grym> tags and a sparse tree, yeah
[17:48:00] <Bayes> uhm tags
[17:48:11] <Bayes> ok I'll check that out
[17:48:15] <pjb> * Questions :ask: / ** TODO What's the color of my cat? / ** TODO When will I die?
[17:48:21] <grym> and then agenda can filter on tags
[17:48:32] <Bayes> I was thinking for exporting a file to html
[17:48:39] <grym> agenda is generally how you ask org to search itself
[17:48:46] <Bayes> so when I share it, all the questions are put in the same place
[17:48:51] <pjb> and for questions in the middle of nowhere: **** TODO Guess a random number? :ask:
[17:49:54] <pjb> Well, agenda will list the questions in a single buffer; for one liners it'll be good, you can save that buffer. For longer questions, you'll have to write some elisp code to extract the sections and build the separate file.
[17:50:22] <Bayes> grym oh is that so? the name always gave the impression that it was for handling dated todos and such
[17:50:28] <pjb> Bayes: ask in #org-mode they may know more. Perhaps something like footnotes?
[17:50:45] <grym> Bayes: it is, but also you can search on ehhh whatever you want

[21:31:45] <Diablo-D3> if we consider all things altogether, amd is the leader by a thin margin, with both arm-land gpu vendors being 2 and 3, with intel as 4th
[21:32:03] <Diablo-D3> with desktop/console only, its intel then amd then nvidia
[21:32:08] <rpav> Diablo-D3: it _should_ be split up into at least a modesetter, a compositor, decorator, and layout manager, where apps render process-locally, and that gets independently attached to the frontend .. or streamed remotely, or they could just take over the screen and modeset locally if you wanted some kind of embedded thing

[22:03:14] <rpav> Diablo-D3: for some of that at least, yeah
[22:03:14] <Diablo-D3> they took it all out of xorg and made independent stuff out of it
[22:03:39] <Diablo-D3> hardware gl context machine is now libdrm + kernel-space drm
[22:03:40] <rpav> but making a window system that works as it ought, rather than like wayland, is actually not an overly daunting prospect
[22:03:50] <Diablo-D3> libgl impl itself is now mesa, and mesa no longer contains dri and drm
[22:03:56] <Diablo-D3> the command stream -> state tracker glue is dri
[22:03:58] <rpav> what _is_, however, is more writing the 20 zillion things you need to make a working environment on _top_ of that
[22:04:08] <Diablo-D3> you dont *need* to write them

[22:04:40] <rpav> not to my hypothetical good windowing system
[22:04:42] <Diablo-D3> you cant undo it
[22:04:54] <Diablo-D3> but a windowing system is only one part of a giant machine
[22:05:05] <rpav> that's what i'm saying :p
[22:05:07] <Diablo-D3> wayland vs x is a weird fucking hill to die on when its about 5% of the code
[22:05:17] <Diablo-D3> the other 95% is already done and mature and shared between the two
[22:05:26] <rpav> but wayland is DOA trash, and i think someone could write something better given all the big pieces exist
[22:05:30] <Diablo-D3> and that 95% is also highly OS specific, windows and osx have their own equivalents
[22:05:47] <Diablo-D3> wayland isnt trash, it solves a different issue than x
[22:05:56] <rpav> but the hard part isn't writing it, it's porting gtk/qt/all-your-apps .. though supporting X would obviously be a big start
[22:05:56] <Diablo-D3> x's problem set no longer exists, so arguably it became trash
[22:06:11] <Diablo-D3> you're asking for a low level rendering primitive api
[22:06:24] <Diablo-D3> so you can use modern gpu hardware the way its intended, but independent of the underlying shit
[22:06:25] <rpav> yet everyone is still mostly using X, because though a lot of it is outmoded, it's _not_ trash
[22:06:27] <Diablo-D3> we already have that

[23:30:49] <sebboh> Yesterday I wondered aloud if lsp-mssql expected to use its connection to an mssql server only for getting the names of objects and such, rather than executing SQL statements I provide.  Turns out it can execute statements, with M-x lsp-mssql-execute-buffer.  So, I don't need to use the old method which depends on the deprecated (and non-trivial to download) osql.exe.  So, yay!
