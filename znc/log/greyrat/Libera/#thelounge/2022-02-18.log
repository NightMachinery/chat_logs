[05:06:16] <johncs> probably going to be something unique to your setup. hard to imagine the lounge's built-in styling doing that
[05:06:41] <loungebeginner01> Can you type something with apostrophe s
[05:06:48] <loungebeginner01> Ohh you did

[05:17:01] <loungebeginner01> Yes 
[05:17:15] <loungebeginner01> But its not happening in this room i guess
[05:17:28] <johncs> so it's happening within one room?
[05:17:50] <loungebeginner01> I have been to just one other room only
[05:18:05] <loungebeginner01> Need to check with few others
[05:18:34] <johncs> i gotta go, but my guess is this doesn't have anything to do with The Lounge in particular. You could put that to the test by loading the lounge in some other browsers and trying some different IRC clients and figuring out when you see the problem and when you don't.
[05:19:02] <johncs> If you do that and the problem still seems to be with the lounge, open up an issue on our GitHub repo and we'll keep an eye out for what might be happening
[05:19:11] <loungebeginner01> Ok. Thankyou

[05:35:53] <MaxLeiter> We color nicks that are present in the channel, like your name in the last message

[11:03:54] <loungebeginner01> MaxLeiter, https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/issues/2008
[11:04:28] <loungebeginner01> i copied the css style posted in the link, at the css style menu of advanced settings. and its fine now.
[11:04:38] <loungebeginner01> thank you
[11:06:25] <fnutt> What you've done now is to ignore nicks that only contains S and T.
[11:06:35] <fnutt> It's a quick fix, not really a propper fix.
[11:06:51] <fnutt> Hopefully we will be able to fix the actual issues soon. :)
[11:15:28] <loungebeginner01> oh ok.
[11:16:39] <fnutt> As in the nick S and the nick T.
[11:16:49] <fnutt> Those you've ignored to colour.

[11:23:02] <loungebeginner01> and wow you posted the issue 4 years back!!
[11:24:12] <capi> i wish i could blacklist certain words for nick detection. everytime someone talks about "capitalism" in a channel i'm in... :-)
[11:24:35] <loungebeginner01> lol
[11:32:39] <loungebeginner01> so i installed nginx 
[11:32:50] <loungebeginner01> trying to configure a reverse proxy
[11:33:14] <loungebeginner01> i dont understand how to execute the command given at https://thelounge.chat/docs/guides/reverse-proxies#nginx
[11:33:21] <loungebeginner01> can someone help me 
[11:35:03] <bookworm> it's not a command, it's a partial configuration
[11:35:30] <bookworm> nginx is a complicated piece of software, you need to read their docs
