[00:10:42] <cth> well this is what happens when you stop doing fan service and start working on the story. That's why I don't appreciate fan service in anime.

[00:32:37] <cth> lol, no, I'm not, but yeah, a lot of good hackers in post-soviet
[00:32:51] <Berlin36> i wonder why tho
[00:32:51] <cth> probably due to high quality theoretical education.
[00:33:04] <Berlin36> might be
[00:33:31] <cth> I mean, it's completely useless in real life, but it definitely gives you a lot of low-level shit whether you want it or not, lol
[00:33:43] <cth> but then if you connect that stuff to real-world... daaamn...
[00:33:49] <cth> you get a lot more insight then other folks
[00:33:50] <Berlin36> oof
[00:35:33] <cth> plus, black-hat is (or was) a lot safer in post-soviet countries. Cuz hackers mostly targeted rich countries and local police would not comply too much even with interpol. So it was safe. You just couldn't travel too far abroad

[01:02:31] <Berlin36> ph dyndns is like noip
[01:02:41] <Bco1981> many isp do that to save ipv4 addresses
[01:02:57] <cth> well then they should supply ipv6
[01:03:04] <Bco1981> and not many normal people needs to forward ports
[01:03:11] <Berlin36> true ^
[01:03:17] <cth> indeed. anyhow, ipv6 should solve that issue
[01:03:24] <Bco1981> if the isp has that
[01:03:33] <Berlin36> so you say it's possible to forward them for free even if you have dynamic ip?
[01:03:53] <cth> dynamic ip has no relation to port forwarding
[01:03:53] <midgardlol> i have a problem with ipv6 because my router is locked up by my ISP and I cant change the dns server for the ipv6
[01:04:02] <Berlin36> well first of all, how to definetely check if i have static ip or not

[01:05:44] <JesseDesu> mootpoot when i git good at blender i want you to print out my models
[01:05:58] <Berlin36> and the other one is given by the isp and is also locked lol, you need to call them so they can open it for half an hour
[01:06:20] <Bco1981> Berlin36: if you log in to your router and find the WAN ip and it's a 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 address. you are behind a NAT service then the ISP needs to forward ports too.

[01:06:46] <Berlin36> aaand what does that mean
[01:06:50] *** Joins: lukedashjr (~luke-jr@user/luke-jr)
[01:06:51] <cth> 1. write a simple network listener. 2. Send some shit to it through your local machine, using the loopback just to make sure it works and listens. 3. Try sending shit to it from somewhere else outside of your machine, but in your network using local ip. This is to check that your OS is not being a little bitch. 4. start working with port forwarding and carefully debugging it from the internet. 5. start figuring out how to use dyndns or similar to solve 
[01:06:52] <cth> the dynamic ip issue.
[01:07:05] <JesseDesu> i never understood what port forwarding does or how to set it up
[01:07:26] <Berlin36> oh
[01:07:29] <Berlin36> JesseDesu
[01:07:35] <Berlin36> try hosting a minecraft server
[01:07:38] <cth> ahahahahahahah
[01:07:44] <cth> that's priceless.
[01:08:02] <Berlin36> you can enter there if your friend is at your home
[01:08:14] <Berlin36> but he can't if he's in another wifi access point
[01:08:27] <Berlin36> because your port is a bitch and doesn't accept guests
[01:08:43] <Berlin36> so you forward the shit out of him, so he'll be more respectful
[01:08:44] <cth> port forwarding is just to forward all requests that come to certain port to certain machine within the network. Because a network usually has one external IP and when shit comes to that ip, the router would not know which client to forward that too.
[01:08:49] *** lukedashjr is now known as luke-jr
[01:09:02] <Berlin36> i guess that's a good explanation too ^
[01:10:03] <cth> when you forward ports, what you do is you ask the router to not be a little bitch and when shit comes to port 1337, just forward that to 192.168.0.13:1337
[01:10:09] <MootPoot> JesseDesu: port forwarding is like selecting which door you want to open in your house to let somebody in ( assuming your house has a few thousand doors)
[01:10:12] <Berlin36> btw i like that hosting a tor or i2p service doesn't need a static ip
[01:10:22] * ahmubashshir likes explanation of Berlin36
[01:10:37] <Berlin36> ayy thanks
[01:10:59] <JesseDesu> mootpoot why is it called forwarding
[01:11:05] <Berlin36> idunno
[01:11:08] <JesseDesu> shouldnt it be called port opening
[01:11:08] <Berlin36> i call it an open port
[01:11:12] <Berlin36> YEESSSS
[01:11:26] <Berlin36> i call it –æ—Ç–∫—Ä—ã—Ç—ã–π –ø–æ—Ä—Ç
[01:11:40] <cth> well you have to specify which IP that port refers to
[01:11:43] <JesseDesu> otkpbitbin nopt?
[01:11:47] <ahmubashshir> JesseDesu: cause router is forwarding the traffic it got to another IP:PORT in the same network
[01:11:53] <Berlin36> eh kind of
[01:11:59] <Berlin36> yes
[01:12:13] <JesseDesu> whoa im confused
[01:12:17] <JesseDesu> hold your horses
[01:12:25] <cth> the example with doors missed that part
[01:12:27] <ahmubashshir> Berlin36: open port refers to the port open for remote traffic by firewall
[01:12:29] * Berlin36 holds horses
[01:12:37] <JesseDesu> explain it like mootpoot's analogy
[01:12:38] <ahmubashshir> suppose I'm a router
[01:12:48] <Berlin36> he's a router ^
[01:12:53] <cth> he is indeed
[01:12:55] <Bco1981> time for warriors of the net
[01:12:55] <Berlin36> yes
[01:13:00] <ahmubashshir> you're a client in my network, JesseDesu 
[01:13:11] <Berlin36> JesseDesu, you're the client
[01:13:14] <cth> you're a network in my client ahmubashshir 
[01:13:18] <JesseDesu> whats a client
[01:13:28] <cth> that's like a server, but on the opposite side :)
[01:13:34] <Berlin36> duuuudeee
[01:13:35] <cth> omg, sorry
[01:13:36] <MootPoot> JesseDesu: think of the forewarding part as you live in a hotel and then you have to call the doorman to open one of a few thousand doors to the hotel and redirect anybody who goes in that one door to your hotel suite

[01:25:26] <cth> that is probably not a code you would wanna show :) 100 if statements sounds to me like a lack of regex skills, lol

[01:39:37] <Duns_Scrotus> Insane syntax, horrible pain of handling file names with spaces
[01:39:46] <Snake`s_Ghost> just use quotes ""
[01:40:01] <Snake`s_Ghost> yeah the syntax can be hard, tho its really meant to be a shell scripting language
[01:40:13] <Snake`s_Ghost> i wonder if it could be better, iirc powershell is not too much better in this regard
[01:40:53] <Duns_Scrotus> File names can have quotes
[01:41:16] <Snake`s_Ghost> Duns_Scrotus, i write shell scripts sometimes to automate things but i dont go totally crazy with it, like i think gentoo's package manager is written in bash O_O
[01:41:28] <Snake`s_Ghost> Duns_Scrotus, yeah quotes can be escaped
[01:41:32] <Duns_Scrotus> No, python
[01:41:54] <Duns_Scrotus> But check out FreeBSD‚Äòs init system and ports tree

[01:43:15] <Duns_Scrotus> I‚Äôm trying to remember exactly the task that made me swear off bash
[01:43:24] <Snake`s_Ghost> you can break it up into multiple lines if you need to
[01:43:55] <Duns_Scrotus> I was trying to do something and there was basically no way to do it because of bash‚Äôs weird string handling

[01:45:06] <Snake`s_Ghost> rename is pretty crazy, but yeah idk
[01:45:16] <Snake`s_Ghost> its actually perl
[01:45:22] <Duns_Scrotus> It was batch transcoding
[01:45:29] <Duns_Scrotus> that‚Äôs what it was
[01:45:36] <Snake`s_Ghost> idk what that even is
[01:45:40] <Snake`s_Ghost> :3
[01:46:03] <Duns_Scrotus> Like I had a bunch of videos I wanted to convert to a different format with a different extension
[01:46:11] <Snake`s_Ghost> uh
[01:46:27] <Snake`s_Ghost> so how did you manage that in python?
[01:46:38] <Snake`s_Ghost> i think ffmpeg would suffice
[01:46:43] <Snake`s_Ghost> tho im not arguing
[01:46:51] <Snake`s_Ghost> if it was easier in python then it was easier in python
[01:47:02] <Duns_Scrotus> Yeah a python script to run ffmpeg commands
[01:47:14] <Snake`s_Ghost> what work did the python do then?
[01:47:24] <Duns_Scrotus> Because generating the output file and in bash was too painful
[01:47:29] <Duns_Scrotus> File name
[01:47:35] <Snake`s_Ghost> example?
[01:48:06] <Duns_Scrotus> my old dvdrip.avi->
[01:48:19] <Duns_Scrotus> my old dvd rip.mkv
[01:49:13] <Duns_Scrotus> Yeah i remember now
[01:50:28] <Duns_Scrotus> The output had to be quoted but needed a command expansion in the quotes
[01:50:51] <Duns_Scrotus> Lmao I could have just stuck it in a variable couldn‚Äôt have I
[01:51:10] <Duns_Scrotus> I still refuse to write bash
[01:51:15] <Snake`s_Ghost> possibly, but when you get stuck you can suffer from tunnel vision
[01:51:35] <Snake`s_Ghost> and if you like to use python then that's good, use that
[01:52:05] <Snake`s_Ghost> i remember i was renaming some files to remove the subtitle author and all that jazz, and it had like spaces and square brackets and shit
[01:52:20] <Snake`s_Ghost> and i had to deal with that cause perl regex was interpreting capture groups and stuff when i didnt want to

[02:29:46] <Snake`s_Ghost> cth, i want to learn to draw
[02:30:15] <Nanobot> I don't understand why people always talk about Rip & Tear when Doom comes up. It's such a bland song, and not even the most iconic Doom song IMO.
[02:30:29] <cth> really?
[02:30:32] <cth> interesting.
[02:30:53] <cth> I enjoy almost all of them
[02:30:55] <Snake`s_Ghost> im sorry jokes going whoosh for me again
[02:31:02] <cth> it's just the clip for rip and tear is very cool

[02:32:28] <cth> well yes, that's iconic
[02:32:29] <cth> sure
[02:32:36] <cth> but it's not heavy
[02:33:08] <Nanobot> cth: That's just because it was tracked SoundBlaster music for DOS.
[02:33:24] <cth> oh definitely
[02:33:39] <cth> still, I can't appreciate 16-bit music.
[02:33:53] <cth> more like 8 bit probably
[02:33:54] <Nanobot> Rip & Tear had better technology, but the song is just bland and flat.
[02:34:09] <cth> well then I don't care about the song.
[02:34:13] <cth> I care about the execution
[02:34:58] <cth> I mean, I don't even think about it. I LOVE the 2016 shit and I don't give a crap about the 90s stuff

[02:40:52] <Nanobot> The terms "8-bit" and "16-bit" in reference to NES/SNES era graphics/sound is a pet peeve of mine. The NES and SNES were not capable of 8-bit graphics. Here's an example of 8-bit graphics: https://c.tenor.com/TNjt9FZgG3YAAAAM/you-might-be-the-best-person-i-know-annie-murphy.gif

[02:45:41] <Nanobot> Measuring graphics in bits only really makes sense if you're measuring the bit depth of pixel data, in which case the NES had 2-bit graphics and the SNES had 4-bit graphics.

[09:59:56] <MootPoot> amigojapan: what was his idea?
[10:00:07] <amigojapan> MootPoot: her* idea,
[10:00:40] <MootPoot> everybody is either a man or a FBI agent online amigojapan 
[10:00:40] <amigojapan> MootPoot: she said, if I had to buy water to make the coffee and milk, why not mix the coffee directly with milk, and that way I dont need to buy water
[10:01:19] <amigojapan> MootPoot: and I could even mix it cold
[10:01:30] <MootPoot> you can...but like
[10:01:30] <amigojapan> MootPoot: it seems it does not need to be warm
[10:01:38] <MootPoot> that's a lot of calories
[10:02:03] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I dont care about calories
[10:02:26] <amigojapan> I am having no sugar, so I am definetly having less calories than normal people
[10:03:00] <amigojapan> no sugar and low carbs
[10:03:09] <MootPoot> werent you already on a diet?
[10:03:19] <amigojapan> yes, what are you talking about
[10:03:32] <amigojapan> MootPoot: the calorie diet is not the kind of diet I am doing
[10:03:35] <MootPoot> oh
[10:03:45] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I am doing a low carb and no dugar diet
[10:03:52] <amigojapan> sugar*
[10:04:10] <MootPoot> So the diabetic diet
[10:04:10] <amigojapan> why do people confuse kinds of dieats?
[10:04:20] <amigojapan> yeah MootPoot , and it works
[10:04:23] <MootPoot> since 99% of diets are calorie diets
[10:04:34] <MootPoot> in some shape or form to lose weight
[10:04:42] <amigojapan> MootPoot: fat and calories are allowed in this diet
[10:04:51] <MootPoot> what is the goal of your diet?
[10:05:16] <amigojapan> MootPoot: in my case I have lost about 20 kilograms in 7 months, in the case of tomako she was able to quit insulin 
[10:05:52] <MootPoot> yeah, if your diet goal was to loose weight, its just another flavour of calorie diet , like a linux distro
[10:06:01] <MootPoot> brb
[10:06:06] <amigojapan> MootPoot: and this is much easier to follow htan a calorie diet

[10:21:42] <MootPoot> I went to warm some cashew milk and had to restart for updates
[10:22:29] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I dont beleve things called "milk" are supposed to be used as a replacement for milk
[10:22:41] <amigojapan> MootPoot: they just call them milk cause they are milky
[10:23:14] <MootPoot> they are though
[10:23:36] <MootPoot> coffee shops and things like that here offer these "milks" as replacement in your drink if you ask
[10:23:43] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I owuld never have soy milk with coffee of cereal, yuck
[10:24:00] <MootPoot> I know it tastes bad, but it is used as a direct replacement for some poeple
[10:24:02] <amigojapan> MootPoot: people are fools
[10:24:45] <amigojapan> MootPoot: soy milk has existed for a way longer time than when it was called "soy milk"
[10:25:00] <amigojapan> MootPoot: it was not designed to replace milk
[10:25:14] <MootPoot> well, its not just soy milk though
[10:25:18] <MootPoot> cashew milk , oat milk
[10:25:29] <MootPoot> but anyways, besides the point
[10:25:32] <amigojapan> ok, those I have not tasted
[10:25:52] <MootPoot> plenty of these newer milks are meant as a direct replacement and are advertised as it
[10:26:08] <amigojapan> MootPoot: who decided that? 
[10:26:17] <amigojapan> MootPoot: its just marketing
[10:26:19] <MootPoot> The people who manufacture it
[10:26:23] <amigojapan> no
[10:26:29] <amigojapan> not for soy milk
[10:26:40] <MootPoot> but we're not talking about only soy milk though 
[10:26:42] <amigojapan> soy milk is ancient
[10:26:49] <MootPoot> and also things work differently in different markets
[10:26:57] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I bet it is marketing for those others too
[10:27:15] <MootPoot> in asia soy milk is its own thing - over here its only sold as a milk replacement option
[10:27:36] <amigojapan> yup
[10:28:55] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I am glad I can still drink milk even tho I am already 43 years old
[10:29:06] <amigojapan> I like hte real thing
[10:29:30] <amigojapan> tomako drinks it too
[10:34:06] <MootPoot> I've started to prefer cashew milk over normal milk
[10:34:13] <MootPoot> I've never really been into normal milk
[10:34:30] <amigojapan> I like cashew nuts, so I may like that
[10:34:44] <MootPoot> the thing with cashew milk is that it has that same thickness as real milk - but has 25cal / 250ml compared to nearly 120-130 for milk
[10:35:01] <MootPoot> so you can drink a lot without worrying about calories
[10:35:09] <amigojapan> I see
[10:35:27] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I can drink up to 1 liter of milk per day
[10:35:37] <amigojapan> tho I dont do it every day
[10:35:54] <MootPoot> I drink a lot of liquid - usually about 3L a day
[10:36:02] <amigojapan> I go some days withought dirnking milk at all
[10:37:13] <MootPoot> my current win10 version will stop being supported in december
[10:37:26] <amigojapan> tomorrow i need to go pick up tomako's medicine, on holloween I am meeting a friend I have not met in like 8 years
[10:37:35] <MootPoot> nice
[10:37:55] <amigojapan> MootPoot: decided to meet after we had the vaccine
[10:38:31] <amigojapan> corona virus infections are very low right now too
[10:38:34] <MootPoot> I ordered some shampoo and body wash online

[12:50:19] <MootPoot> Like for example my Xbox controller I use to play games on my pc
[12:50:55] <MootPoot> It's built assuming you put in 1.5v alkalines, so the system tells me the battery is at 50% then suddenly turns off 
[12:51:15] <MootPoot> Since it measures voltage to estimate charge 
[12:51:27] <amigojapan> MootPoot: by "breaks" you mean "it does not messure properly, I suppose
[12:51:48] <amigojapan> not permanently damages

[12:52:47] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I guess the only solution owuld be to include a dial to select what kind of battery you are mesuring
[12:53:02] <MootPoot> Yeah but can't do that on existing equipment 
[12:53:09] <amigojapan> right
[12:53:52] <amigojapan> MootPoot: it is possible to ocnvert from 1.2V up to 1.5V, but ti is hard to cram that electronics into an existign device
[12:53:55] <MootPoot> Only solution is to either buy disposables, get those expensive LiPo AA rechargeables, or have a small pile of Ni-MH batteries instead 
[12:54:05] <MootPoot> Ready to swap out 
[12:54:49] <MootPoot> amigojapan: yeah, I think the inbuilt converter already does that. It's mostly that upconverting the voltage won't help you with incorrect readings

[14:25:43] <HeTo> what‚Äôs nice about QML is that you can write those parts of the code that are tightly coupled to the UI within the QML code. with Qt Widgets you end up having to write C++ that‚Äôs tightly coupled to the UI but separate from it
[14:26:10] <amigojapan> HeTo: Berlin37 only knows C++

[14:45:32] <KatrinValerie> Totalitarism is on the rise
[14:45:54] <emmeka> my favourite one is the last Greek monarch. The Greeks, when they formed their current republic in the 70s, told the former king that his titles were forfeit and to be eligible as a citizen of the republic, he would have to take a last name.
[14:45:55] * Snake`s_Ghost yawns
[14:46:23] <emmeka> he refused, so they just gave him his royal house as a last name: Gl√ºcksberg
[14:46:27] <MootPoot> 200IQ move, make your last name your "forfeit" title
[14:46:31] <theholyduck> amigojapan: like looking at the sourcing for the claim that 1 king perosnally invented the whole thing its a bit suspect to me
[14:46:34] <emmeka> which sounds very foreign to a greek at least
[14:46:44] <theholyduck> and wikipedia only cites like korean goverment propaganda sites
[14:46:50] <theholyduck> for the claim 
[14:46:59] <theholyduck> and saying that people writing on behalf of the king at the time said the king did it
[14:47:14] <theholyduck> which saying he didnt is usually a good way to get your head chopped off
[14:47:16] <amigojapan> theholyduck: at least he helped spread it, cause it is hard to spread something liek that unless you have power
[14:47:18] <emmeka> and the former king refused this because it implies he ~wasn't Greek~ and he also refused to invent his own last name, so the Greeks were just like "k you're not a citizen, get out of the country"
[14:47:31] <emmeka> the dude's still alive, and travels on a Danish passport
[14:47:32] <darkwitch> MootPoot, you mean like Steven King?

[14:49:41] <Urchin[emacs]> emmeka: King Zog of Albania is probably the funniest one in general
[14:49:59] <emmeka> so the Danes gave him a passport that says Constantine de Grecia, "Constantine of Greece"
[14:50:06] <emmeka> but the Greeks were upset about this
[14:50:10] <Snake`s_Ghost> amigojapan, how did you drink coffee?
[14:50:26] <emmeka> so when he went back to Greece, the state decided his name was "Degrecias"
[14:50:29] <Urchin[emacs]> Zog holds the distinction of being the only chief of state to have fired back at an assassin
[14:50:41] <emmeka> and the media refers to him this way, as if it is his last name.
[14:50:44] <amigojapan> Snake`s_Ghost: I poured milk into a cup and mixed it with instant coffee, that was darkwitches idea, not using any water
[14:51:00] <Snake`s_Ghost> gross

[16:20:28] <zoidberg> no, haven't watched it but I know about it
[16:21:11] <amigojapan> zoidberg: in the actual GI joe cartoon, every time a plane blows up , or a tank blows up, even of the enemy, always you can see them escape alive, like on a parachute
[16:21:35] <amigojapan> zoidberg: so like nobody ever dies
[16:21:41] <amigojapan> even in war
[16:22:51] <zoidberg> amigojapan: Even during world wars it was an unwritten rule to not shoot a falling aircraft or someone who escaped out of jet/aircraft.
[16:25:04] <amigojapan> zoidberg: I see, yeah, even Japan had war prisoners, who they did not kill
[16:25:42] <amigojapan> zoidberg: not that they treated them well, but they did not kill them

[16:57:40] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: !!!!
[16:57:49] <Berlin37> i have just watched second episode of Lain
[16:57:52] <amigojapan> you are here,, and i am awake
[16:57:57] <Berlin37> duuuuuude this anime is c r a z y
[16:58:02] <TsundereNoises> ButterNoodle: do you think birdgirls are what catgirls like to watch for porn?
[16:58:13] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: HAVE A GOOD NIGHT
[16:58:14] <amigojapan> Berlin37: I cant watch it, too slow
[16:58:15] <TsundereNoises> oyasumi
[16:58:21] <amigojapan> ouch TsundereNoises 
[16:58:28] <TsundereNoises> Berlin37: Lain is great, don't listen to amigo
[16:58:34] <TsundereNoises> let's all love Lain
[16:58:37] <Berlin37> ye i'll watch it
[16:58:48] * TsundereNoises makes buzzing power line sound
[16:58:55] <ButterNoodle> TsundereNoises: I think bad birdgirls watch catgirl porn
[16:58:58] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: lain is great, but not the anime, the abridges version is great
[16:58:59] <Berlin37> anyways, third episode let's goooo
[16:59:17] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: it also explains the meaning clearly
[16:59:39] <amigojapan> abriged version*
[16:59:43] * TsundereNoises doubt
[17:00:01] <TsundereNoises> I mean "explaining the meaning clearly" almost inherently misses the point
[17:00:06] <TsundereNoises> it's more ambiguous than that
[17:00:06] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: watcing hte anime is pure torutre
[17:00:36] <TsundereNoises> ButterNoodle: or maybe good birdgirls who want to be bad?
[17:00:57] <TsundereNoises> I refuse to argue about wrong anime opinions right now, I'm feeling much too silly
[17:01:07] <DunceCotus> lain anime gets a bit samey quick
[17:01:12] <DunceCotus> but it has great moments
[17:01:14] <TsundereNoises> ugh
[17:01:19] <TsundereNoises> philistines
[17:01:37] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I think the problem is hte pace
[17:01:39] <DunceCotus> I like how they animated lain
[17:01:46] <DunceCotus> but plotting-wise its a bit of a mess
[17:02:14] <DunceCotus> the opening gives me the creeps (in the best way)
[17:02:17] <DunceCotus> that opening zoom
[17:02:27] <TsundereNoises> wow Urchin was on a roll yesterday, left me 5 images
[17:02:53] <TsundereNoises> it's okay for the pace to be too slow for you, but don't act like it's an objective flaw
[17:03:01] <TsundereNoises> I think the pace is ideal for what it's aiming or
[17:03:01] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: how many images do you get after bieng gone for a month?
[17:03:03] <TsundereNoises> for
[17:03:15] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: it was a ton, I don't even know
[17:03:20] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: but not like 5 a day or anything

[17:07:33] <beaky> dog goddesses like inugami korone
[17:07:53] <DunceCotus> like they make female dogs or cats look different in animation
[17:08:13] <DunceCotus> dogs are naturally masc, cats femme

[17:08:34] <TsundereNoises> dog girls are naturally genki

[17:17:01] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: tomako had me quit coffee for over 2 weeks, until today
[17:17:12] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: it was torture
[17:17:30] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: I assume you couldn't have black tea either?
[17:17:49] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: I used to try to cure myself of my caffiene addiction once a year or so, just on principle
[17:17:55] <TsundereNoises> then I realized I was making myself suffer for no reason
[17:18:04] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: the thing is that tomako has been looking at all the money I spent on everyting, and decided I spend too much on coffee
[17:18:21] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: the problem was not caffine addiction
[17:18:24] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: I mean making your own coffee IS much cheaper
[17:18:42] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: but there are several reasons why I thought i could not make it
[17:18:47] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: but yeah, if she makes you do that, drink some tea, it'll take the edge off
[17:18:57] <TsundereNoises> caffinated black tea I mean
[17:19:27] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: coffee is pretty simple and doesn't require any sharp objects
[17:19:33] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: just hot water
[17:19:50] <DunceCotus> coffee requires tibetan slave labour
[17:19:56] <DunceCotus> or some sheeit
[17:20:07] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: I could not drink the water of this appartment either
[17:20:09] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: of course, ButterNoodle and I probably spend a decent amount on coffee despite making it at home, but that's because of buying expensive coffee and drinking a lot
[17:20:18] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: but darkwitch came up with a solution
[17:20:29] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: water filter?
[17:20:36] <amigojapan> no TsundereNoises 
[17:20:46] <TsundereNoises> I mean, if the water really tastes bad, it WILL make your coffee taste like shit
[17:20:49] <DunceCotus> drink of the water
[17:21:15] <DunceCotus> you do not generally want your coffee tasting like shit
[17:21:17] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: tomako think s the water tastes like mold
[17:21:25] <DunceCotus> you want your shit tasting like coffee
[17:21:40] <TsundereNoises> DunceCotus: yes, Civet girls are cute
[17:22:05] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: you should probably get that apartment condemned
[17:22:14] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: those water filters you put on the faucet are surprisingly good for that kind of thing
[17:22:18] <DunceCotus> yokai cleansed
[17:23:06] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: now tomako wnats me otp go buy her tea, she rememberred she has nothing ot drink tonight
[17:23:14] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: I can harly talk with you
[17:23:36] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: anyway, the solution was, mix instant coffee with cold milk
[17:23:51] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: how is that a solution
[17:23:52] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: I mean, better than nothing I guess
[17:24:03] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: my inner coffee snob cringes at such a thing though
[17:24:21] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: does it mix well in just cold milk?
[17:24:27] <DunceCotus> confusing
[17:24:34] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: its a little slow, but it works
[17:24:58] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: I actually have been buying a crate of bottled iced tea from a japanese company each summer (like 12 of those big 2 liter bottles)
[17:24:58] <DunceCotus> I suppose
[17:24:59] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: beggers cant be choosers
[17:25:08] <TsundereNoises> you can't buy decent iced tea in the US
[17:25:37] <DunceCotus> yet the only decent Ice T derives from the US
[17:25:42] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: I still think you should just learn to make coffee, then you could get good coffee like you get at the 7-11
[17:25:47] <DunceCotus> (has no idea about rap-hop)
[17:25:49] <amigojapan> anyway, I am going to 7 11 , taking my phone with me...
[17:26:00] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: good luck
[17:26:06] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: I would need hot water right?
[17:26:27] <TsundereNoises> DunceCotus: I always forget the Law & Order actor has a side gig as a rapper
[17:26:28] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: that is asking for a lot of impossible things ot me
[17:26:31] <DunceCotus> coffee is more of an institution than a drink
[17:26:38] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: yeah, but you don't have a kettle or anything?
[17:26:53] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: I am not allowed to buy water tho
[17:27:05] <DunceCotus> wtf

[17:27:27] <DunceCotus> is really as simple as a kettle
[17:27:27] <TsundereNoises> Urchin[emacs]: CUTE
[17:27:36] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: she does not wnat that either, also we are kind of broke, that is why all the economic pressure nto to spend on coffe came from
[17:27:41] <TsundereNoises> Urchin[emacs]: that was also me the first time I slept in the same bed as someone else
[17:27:48] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I have an electric kettle
[17:28:05] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: so the hot water part isn't a problem then
[17:28:11] <amigojapan> ok going ot 7 11, but still on chat
[17:28:22] <DunceCotus> bye
[17:28:40] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: it is, cause the cost of water is prohibiting, and hten i owuld laso need ot buy milk or creme
[17:28:41] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: can't you just use electric kettle to boil water
[17:28:42] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: honestly I could send you a plastic coffee funnel thing, I have a bunch of extras, but I think the shipping to Japan is more than the thing costs new
[17:28:55] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: using milk eliminates that cost
[17:29:14] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: you assume i have a working stove
[17:29:25] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: you should know better, you know baout how i copok
[17:29:37] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: lol, but also why do you need a stove, electric kettle is enough
[17:29:57] <DunceCotus> electric kettle on the stove, duh
[17:30:14] <DunceCotus> superheated water
[17:30:31] <DunceCotus> it comes out as bose-einstein condensate
[17:30:33] <amigojapan> ok going to 7 11 now for real
[17:31:05] <TsundereNoises> when I visit Japan some day, maybe I should bring all the stuff I need for coffee in a hotel room, and just give all but the electric kettle to amigo at the end of the trip
[17:31:11] <TsundereNoises> dry milk, filters, etc
[17:31:24] <DunceCotus> tie iron
[17:32:00] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: hotels have everything you need for coffee, including the coffee
[17:32:31] <DunceCotus> the only thing missing is good cheap insta-caff
[17:32:39] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: yes, but hotel coffee is shit
[17:32:47] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: at least at any hotel I can afford
[17:32:57] <Sxem> my mother has been buying me keurig cups for many years
[17:32:59] <DunceCotus> TsundereNoises: motel cofe is where its at
[17:33:16] <DunceCotus> cofey
[17:33:28] <TsundereNoises> DunceCotus: last time I stayed at a motel, I had to mix the free hot chocolate packets with the coffee to make it even remotely drinkable
[17:33:29] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: 7 11 coffee won't brake the bank on a trip
[17:33:43] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: I mean, I'll try it once at least on principle
[17:33:57] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: I probably wouldn't really do that, I like tea and Japan would be a good place to try lots of tea
[17:34:13] <Sxem> i want an aeropress coffee machine. i say machine buts really just a series of 2 tubes
[17:34:19] <DunceCotus> Seven-Eleven sounds like a terrorist day
[17:34:32] <Sxem> i want an aeropress coffee machine. i say machine but its really just a series of 2 tubes
[17:34:39] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: but I really do have a travel coffee setup, I used to go to a board game/tabletop roleplaying game convention every year, making my own coffee saves like $40 with how much that shit gets inflated at conventions
[17:34:57] <Sxem> aeropress is ideal for travel coffee. its small and easy to clean

[17:36:44] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: that one is actually bad
[17:36:53] <DunceCotus> matt|lib: oh right
[17:37:02] <DunceCotus> matt|lib: I could never get the hang of German
[17:37:03] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: canned coffee sucks in general
[17:37:13] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: I generally agree
[17:37:22] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: I would only drink it on a pinch
[17:37:29] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: although I think it could be better than it is, there are some bottled coffees that are okay
[17:37:33] <matt|lib> it's not super hard. they have one concrete rule that's almost never violated.. the conjugated verb goes in the second position of the sentence always, and most sentences follow the same pattern
[17:37:47] <matt|lib> plenty of irregular verbs though..
[17:37:58] <DunceCotus> conjugated verb?
[17:38:04] <TsundereNoises> I don't know German, but I know Kafka wrote a lot of big long sentences with the verb at the end after like half a page of sentence

[20:08:05] <zoidberg> the one I am thinking has them drinking tea and eating cake on tanks and stuff
