[03:38:57] <biberao> hi
[03:39:48] <biberao> stupid question 2 < (x)/(x-1), in which circumstance do you do 2(x-1)<x or/and you do 0<(x)/(x-1)-2
[03:39:51] <biberao> ?
[03:42:30] <PendulumSwinger> wdym by circumstance?

[03:43:20] <biberao> well
[03:43:24] <biberao> it both work
[03:43:46] <biberao> but why some teachers advise the second alternative

[03:44:22] <biberao> yes

[03:58:34] <buster> biberao, if you multiply both sides of an inequality by a thing X, you have to remember to reverse the inequality if/when X is negative. (it's also not great when X is zero.)
[04:00:13] <buster> so 2(x-1)<x is the same as x<2, but 2<x/(x-1) is different from that
[04:01:06] <biberao> because of the sign?
[04:01:20] <biberao> so the approach is adding subtraction 2?

[04:03:55] <buster> maybe, but it still leaves you with a non-obvious question (right?). multiplying by x-1 does simplify matters, but you need to consider both cases, x<1 and x>1.
[04:07:58] <buster> can you sketch a graph of x/(x-1)? (it's the reciprocal of 1-1/x.)

[13:11:25] <dila> i thought you might have an opinion
[13:12:43] <int-e> dila: Sure, I'd rather work in GF(2^n) and have fewer variables when possible.
[13:13:56] <int-e> dila: It's a bit of a no-brainer because switching from GF(2^n) to GF(2) is always possible if it turns out to be convenient, but it loses information.
[13:14:11] <pikapika> Hey int-e would you have any idea what techniques were used to solve lagrange point equations in the pre-calculator era?
[13:15:33] <dila> int-e: what information is lost? you can always "compound" variables into a single GF(2^n) element
[13:15:48] <int-e> pikapika: no... actually, maybe; you assume concentric circular trajectories for the three bodies and solve the conditions for the forces on the three bodies to balance out

[13:17:37] <pikapika> Would it be valid to assume people would have used bisection or newton-raphson?
[13:17:52] <int-e> dila: ah, maybe you're just treating GF(2^n) as a vector space over GF(2) in which case there's no advantage. working in GF(2^n) really only makes sense if you use the multiplicative structure.

[13:24:49] <dila> is there a way to avoid rewriting the equations when new solutions from the other equations are available?
[13:26:09] <int-e> solve g(f(x))=z, compute y as f(x)?
[13:26:52] <dila> hmm yes, that makes sense but sometimes the composition is quite large and not practical

[17:01:14] <dextaa> I have a question about automorphisms (Sigma*, concat) (Sigma* finite length words, and Sigma finite alphabet) only has the set of automorphisms which swap every letter in every word for a different letter?
[17:02:45] <riv> let f be an automorphism that respects concatenation, f must map single chars to single chars to be bijective
[17:03:34] <Z-module> (also, that actual sign is graphically a bit too intricate and colorful for a convenience store just wanting to make the line more efficient... maybe they just asked a friend/coworker who's used to doing nontrivial printing)

[17:04:46] <dextaa> the ones which map single letters to other letters
[17:04:51] <riv> <riv> let f be an automorphism that respects concatenation, f must map single chars to single chars to be bijective
[17:04:54] <riv> how about this
[17:05:24] <dextaa> true :)
[17:06:19] <Z-module> hmm, on an *infinite* alphabet, there would be some other automorphisms, I'm pretty sure
[17:07:08] <dextaa> that sounds above my pay-grade

It's from the easy fact that under both phi and phi^-1, word lengths stay the same or go up, never down, so in fact they always stay the same.

[17:58:12] <riv> the legs would be vertical

[19:29:24] <riv> the standard story is that we define N inductively, Z as a quotient or pairs of naturals, R as cauchy sequences or dedekind cuts of Q and then once we are done we use the injection Z -> R to replace our integers with reals so that 2 in Z is set-equal to 2 in R

[19:30:11] <riv> I like the category theory situation where you basically only care about anything up to ismorphism
[19:30:56] <Galois> in type theory you solve this problem a different way. You define your canonical isomorphisms and then designate coercions from N to Z to Q to R. I think this is actually what mathematicians do internally even if they don't vocalize it.
[19:31:08] <riv> agreed Galois
[19:31:11] <em> The other day I shaken to my core when I found out that ismorphism doesn't mean that two things are the same though.

[19:31:28] <loopspace> riv: descriptions of what a thing is in terms of how it behaves (relations to other things) vs. a particular representation also holds appeal for me.

[23:49:45] <riv> i see what you mean!
