[00:34:53] <ZacSharp> remote can't prevent deletion in your local repo
[00:35:21] <gustik> the easiest solution how to get around this is just to clone the repo again , delete the repo on the remote (gitlab) and recreate newly

[00:35:55] <ZacSharp> are you trying to delete locally or on the remote?
[00:36:23] <gustik> well, as I have no way how to control what gitlab does, I am trying it locally, yes

[00:36:57] *** Quits: pulse (~pulse@user/pulse) (Quit: Join a community of dragon tamers at https://indiedevs.net/)
[00:39:46] <ZacSharp> each repo exists on its own so whatever you do on gitlab should not affect your local repo and vice versa

[00:41:11] <ZacSharp> so I'm not sure how gitlab maintenance helped on your local repo
[00:41:25] <gustik> it helped on their side
[00:41:40] <gustik> the projects size shrunk from 80 MB to 60 MB
[00:42:04] <gustik> and when I do git clone on it, it clones 12 MB <- which is correct
[00:42:36] <ZacSharp> what's the problem then?
[00:42:38] <gustik> the question is now ... why it does still use up 60 MB locally and also on gitlab's side ... something must be holding it back from cleaning up
[00:43:21] <henk> Walex, j416: in case you are interested, here is what I ended up with: for f in code/modules/*; do git init ../new_modules_repos/${f:t}; git-filter-repo --subdirectory-filter $f --target ../new_modules_repos/${f:t} --refname-callback 'return refname.replace(b"master", b"main")' --prune-degenerate always --prune-empty always; done

[00:43:29] <gustik> well, at least I have a solution ... delete it locally, recreate it by cloning and then delete in on gitlab and push it back again
[00:43:30] <ZacSharp> if you do a fresh clone it downloads 12MB and takes up 60MB?
[00:43:54] <gustik> yes, the old clone takes up 60 MB ... a new one is on 12 MB , which it should be
[00:44:49] <gustik> but logically it should be the same, why is it taking up 60 MB on remote side, when cloning only gets 12 MB
[00:44:52] <ZacSharp> I don't think recloning is a problem, but recreating on gitlab might have side effects you don't want
[00:44:55] <gustik> this is all somehow strange
[00:45:52] <gustik> don't worry about that ... it is a fresh repo... I can recreate it ... but still somehow is bugs me that it's not working how it's supposed
[00:46:42] <ZacSharp> I don't know whether gitlab keeps some sort of reflog by itself, so at least on their side the problem might solve itself in a few days or so
[00:47:40] <ZacSharp> on your local repo there should only be the (now empty) reflogs and potentially other refs, but it seems like they should all point to things you want to keep
[00:47:54] <gustik> yes, might be .. but that still does not explain why my old clone is still on 60 MB, exactly as theirs

[01:03:32] <gustik> https://paste.debian.net/plain/1220456
[01:04:39] <gustik> however, it was the reference holding it back
