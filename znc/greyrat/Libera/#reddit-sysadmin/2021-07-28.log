[00:01:19] <oxipital> forgot them, said postgres

[16:44:42] <teh_f4ll3n> Jaelae, vCentre settings set to manual
[16:44:43] <teh_f4ll3n> ?
[16:45:00] <Jaelae> separate. this is a host specific setting. i think we must have a script running that causes it
[16:45:06] <Jaelae> trying to find just for the sake of knowing why
[16:45:23] <teh_f4ll3n> my ESXi hosts are all set to Manual by default
[16:45:42] <Jaelae> correct. i intentionally change it to be start and stop with host. then i set a timeout of like 15 minutes
[16:45:49] <Jaelae> the timeout is still there but it switched back to manual which is odd
[16:46:02] <Jaelae> reason is this way if you reboot a host you can simply SSH into it without changing anything on the host configuration to help troubleshooting efforts.

[18:59:41] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> i think a-ko got his pto paid out in his last layoff too
[18:59:42] <Alternity> afaik in most states you have to pay out any unused PTO when a person leaves
[18:59:45] <Alternity> even if they got fired
[18:59:53] <Alternity> maybe your state has shitty worker proteciton laws
[18:59:56] <Jaelae> here in new jersey you don't get shit i think ;)

[19:00:31] <sd> 02<r​yalln> ill jsut keep my 4 weeks leave plus like 10 days of paid sick leave and a few other random ones
[19:00:36] <vinrock> jaelae my mom used to work for st peters in new brunswick and they used to save up sick days and cash out at the end of the year
[19:00:38] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> the policy defines it like.... 7 days sick, 14 days PTO or something illy
[19:00:49] <Jaelae> ah nice
[19:00:51] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> I really get 6 weeks a year total if you factor in holiday time
[19:00:59] <Jaelae> i work kinda in new brunswick but yea we dont have that
[19:00:59] <vinrock> i gues thats not a thing now but back then it was how all the nurses would pay for christmas gifts for their families
[19:01:05] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> some holidays are mandatory, but you get floating holiday time as well
[19:01:17] <sd> 10<a​lazare619> i get 26 days a year of vaca/pto a year
[19:01:20] <Alternity> you dont get sick time, just vacation time/pto paid out in most places
[19:01:29] <Alternity> depends if they do PTO or they do seperate sick/leave time
[19:01:39] <vinrock> jaelae are you on 287 in the am
[19:01:43] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> so im taking all of next week off, but 2 days are partial holiday time and 3 days are partial PTO/full

[20:20:37] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> rpifan: apple's *always* stated they can do it with the purchase receipt and ID
[20:20:43] <AnonymooseReddtr> holy shit
[20:20:46] <oxipital> this isnt data encryption
[20:20:47] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> IE: proving you're the original owner

[20:20:57] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> rpifan: they can't undo filevault drive encryption
[20:21:03] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> this is just a bios-level bricking of the device if it's stolen
[20:21:04] <Rpifan> Well this is new stuff. I haven't bought a MacBook since like 2010 or something 
[20:21:05] <oxipital> its secure boot or whatever apple calls their version of it
[20:21:08] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> then you prove you got it back and they unbrick it
[20:21:12] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> it's not secureboot
[20:21:18] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> that's different
[20:21:20] <Rpifan> I see
[20:21:43] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> rpifan: or say, you lose access to your icloud account and the hacker bricks it or whatever, they can undo all that if you prove your ownership/identity
[20:21:44] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> etc
[20:21:47] <signofzeta> It's powered by their T2 chip, on Intel Macs.  It's not Secure Boot, it's something else.  They call it Activation Lock, for what that's worth.
[20:21:51] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> but yea, they can't undo the drive encryption
[20:21:58] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> it's on pre-t2 macs too
[20:22:03] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> but either way
[20:22:06] <signofzeta> If your Mac is linked to an iCloud account and erased, then the macOS setup will ask the last iCloud user to sign in.
[20:22:20] <AnonymooseReddtr> yeah you really should setup the enterprise purchasing stuff for apple products going forward
[20:22:25] <oxipital> im assuming we learn the secrets of this technology by becoming authorized service providers
[20:22:25] <AnonymooseReddtr> Apple does the same with iphones too FYI
[20:22:54] <Rpifan> It's all a bit fancy for me 
[20:23:14] <vinrock> i'll issue iphones to certain people but if they request one, they're on their own and have to go to the apple store if they have problems
[20:23:15] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> oxipital: nah, i suspect the activation lock won't be covered by any repair stuff because it's theft deterrent/tracking, you can replace the T2 assembly&mainboard and reserialize it and have a "new" laptop
[20:23:31] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> vinrock: you should still get a mac and use configurator to enroll them in DEP
[20:23:35] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> DEP/ABM
[20:23:41] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> so you can remove icloud locks when they turn in if they forget
[20:23:56] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> you don't have to set up MDM or anything, just have a mac mini with configurator to enroll them
[20:23:57] <vinrock> yeah i should finally do that
[20:24:09] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> unlike macs, which the reseller has to register to your ABM / DEP account
[20:24:12] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> iphones you can just do yourself
[20:24:26] <technonerd> dep makes everything easier
[20:24:27] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> so you have to buy it via insight and give them your DEP account number at the time lol
[20:24:31] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> or any other reseller
[20:24:50] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> vinrock: gotta do it before handing out, i think the enrollment process requires a wipe at a point
[20:24:51] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> lol

[20:26:43] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> essentially, if you get past it, boom locked again

[20:28:01] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> yea, im guessing it changes the serial number
[20:28:06] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> otherwise if you sign into icloud or go online again
[20:28:06] <signofzeta> There's no way that's an Apple-sanctioned tool.  I wonder what they do internally.

[20:28:16] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> OR
[20:28:18] <oxipital> you manually clear the chip via the usb programmer
[20:28:22] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> right
[20:28:28] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> but once the OS goes on line again, it validates its shit

[20:28:59] <oxipital> then rewrite it with a cleared data block
[20:28:59] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> so they either have to somehow neuter the lock functionality or change the serial number
