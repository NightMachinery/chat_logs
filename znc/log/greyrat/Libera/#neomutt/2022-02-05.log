[02:16:22] <flatcap> hi ajr1 
[02:17:36] <ajr1> hi
[02:18:40] <flatcap> here's a very minimal (but working) pop config: https://gist.github.com/flatcap/4bc51d6f81f990fbd8bff00613922585
[02:19:03] <flatcap> `neomutt -F pop.rc` to use it

[02:20:16] * flatcap looks at ajr1's config...
[02:20:58] <flatcap> pop doesn't support folders, just an inbox. it's old and basic
[02:22:09] <flatcap> mutt-wizard is quick and very clever and will probably give you a working config, but it can contain a lot of detail that you might not need or understand
[02:23:24] <flatcap> oh, local folders.  if you try to save to them, I think they should be created

[02:47:02] <bookworm> putting email in CACHE_DIR is a poor choice... the hole semantics of that is that you can nuke it and recreate the assets in there from the origin... with POP you generally can't (MUAs are supposed to fetch && delete on the server)
