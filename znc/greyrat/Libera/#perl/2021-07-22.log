[01:07:48] <kensanata> I'm a bit confused by POD lists and Meta CPAN. If I use =over and =item in my POD, the list items seem to render as some sort of table of contents or menu? What's the deal here: am I using POD wrong? Example: https://metacpan.org/release/SCHROEDER/App-phoebe-4.00_03/view/script/phoebe#OPTIONS
[01:07:48] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ Phoebe - serve a wiki as a Gemini site - metacpan.org ]
[01:08:33] <kensanata> Or perhaps I'm just confused by the bold emphasis.
[01:08:51] <Grinnz> kensanata: if you want a list, the usual way is `=item *` for each entry with a paragraph following containing that item's text
[01:09:11] <Grinnz> whereas =item with arbitrary text is meant to be a deeplinkable item heading
[01:09:36] <kensanata> Ah!
[01:09:46] <kensanata> Thanks, that helps.
[01:09:53] <xenu> which btw is something you will *not* learn from perlpod
[01:10:32] <kensanata> It makes me reconsider the use of bullet lists, in any case. :)

[01:12:40] <ehuelsmann[m]>  quick question: does Moo support that I define more than one class (each in its own package) in a single file?
[01:13:26] <ehuelsmann[m]> I'm even using scoped packages, if that matters.
[01:14:38] <Grinnz> sure, it just affects the package you use Moo in

[01:15:21] <ehuelsmann[m]> ok. that's what I hoped, but then I'm more puzzled. I'll try to understand what's going on a bit more then.
[01:16:39] <ehuelsmann[m]> never mind. I have the failure on my part.
[01:18:32] <kensanata> Another thing I wonder is how metacpan decides what to show on the package's main page. How does it know that the Documentation of App::phoebe is from script/phoebe, and why doesn't it show the documentation when I click on the libraries themselves, like App::Phoebe, App::Phoebe::Web, etc.? https://metacpan.org/release/SCHROEDER/App-phoebe-4.00_03 
[01:18:32] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ App-phoebe-4.00_03 - a Gemini-based wiki - metacpan.org ]
[01:21:50] <lopid> there seem to be release, dist, and pod, with no obvious navigation twixt
[01:23:28] <lopid> you can get to the dist by clicking the 'skip to end of track'-like icon next to the release version at the top of your release link
[01:24:10] <lopid> "fa-step-forward" icon, apparently
[01:25:30] <kensanata> Heh. Yeah. I'm reorganizing my code as you can see by comparing the latest dev and the latest actual release. What confuses me now is that in the latest dev release, the documentation on metacpan seems to be pulled from my files in a way that I don't understand.
[01:26:51] <kensanata> As in: when I click the App::Phoebe link under the "Provides" header, I get to see the source code of lib/App/Phoebe.pm instead of the pod2html result. Is this what you would expect, or did I make a mistake somewhere?
[01:28:26] <lopid> tbh i wouldn't expect anything, because i know what i'd get isn't whatever i chose to expect. i would hope for https://metacpan.org/pod/App::phoebe, though
[01:28:28] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ App::phoebe - an app that serves a wiki as a Gemini and web site - metacpan.org ]
[01:29:20] <lopid> then i'd sigh and just do a search for the module in the search box and hope one of the results is that pod
[01:30:27] <kensanata> haha
[01:31:09] <kensanata> Well, I'm happy to say that "Phoebe" under the "Documentation" heading does the right thing, pulling the documentation from script/phoebe. I don't know how it decided to do that, but I'm not complaining. :D
[01:31:47] <lopid> leave it alone and back away slowly
[01:32:16] <kensanata> Will do!
[01:35:46] <haj> kensanata: script/phoebe is the only file which has a =head1 NAME.   This _could_ be the reason that its documentation is shown

[14:48:21] <ehuelsmann[m]> Next question: How can I export constants from a module that is a Moo class? Should I modify @ISA to include Exporter? And declare @EXPORT_OK ? or is there a better way?
[14:49:19] <mst> ehuelsmann[m]: so, "use Exporter 'import';" will work but IME every time I make a class also be an exporter I end up regretting it and splitting them up
[14:49:35] <shlomif> mst++
[14:49:54] <mst> ehuelsmann[m]: also if you mean already loaded, Devel::InnerPackage
[14:50:12] <Altreus> pretty sure there's an export module that doesn't require subclassing, but yes the whole concept is a bit crossing the streams
[14:50:33] <mst> Altreus: "use Expoter 'import';" is that, yes :P
[14:50:45] <shlomif> s/pot/port/
[14:50:48] <ehuelsmann[m]> mst: yes, I mean already loaded.
[14:51:03] <mst> shlomif: I typed it right when giving the recommendation :D
[14:51:08] <mst> ehuelsmann[m]: then what I said
[14:51:16] <ehuelsmann[m]> mst: the exporter is there because I want to export class constants (through EXPORT_OK, not by default)
[14:51:27] <mst> ehuelsmann[m]: yes, I know, I still always regret it
[14:51:36] <shlomif> mst: "use Expoter"
[14:51:49] <mst> shlomif: < mst> ehuelsmann[m]: so, "use Exporter 'import';"
[14:52:34] <shlomif> <mst> Altreus: "use Expoter 'import';" is that, yes :P
[14:52:49] <Altreus> ah, gotcha
[14:52:58] <ehuelsmann[m]> check. I may regret it. For now it seems like the ideal solution :-)
[14:53:04] <Altreus> presumably this means you end up with an import method on your class
[14:53:15] <mst> shlomif: yes, I said I typed it right when given the recommendation - then wrong when repeating it to altreus
[14:53:27] <Altreus> what if you want an import method on your class, and not to be importable?
[14:53:33] <shlomif> mst: ah, ok
[14:53:47] <shlomif> sigh
[14:53:54] <mst> ehuelsmann[m]: I tend to do MyThing::Constants - and then import those into the class
[14:54:31] <mst> ehuelsmann[m]: now, yes, making it EXPORT_OK means it probably won't break for the moment
[14:54:52] <mst> ehuelsmann[m]: but it's like watersports at an orgy - no matter how good an idea it seems like at the time, eventually somebody's going to get splashed who didn't expect it
[14:56:24] <ehuelsmann[m]> since you insist, I'll give it some more thought :-)
[14:59:37] <LeoNerd> Hrm. I'm suddenly finding myself in a mixed mood about the fact that signatured subs complain if given too many arguments
[14:59:47] <mst> LeoNerd: ', @)'
[15:00:02] <LeoNerd> If I define an API that takes a one-arg callback function, it's really tempting for users to just write   $obj->set_thingy( sub ($x) { ... } );
[15:00:19] <LeoNerd> But then if later I decide to pass more information, say some sort of context hash or whatever, I can't just add more args or all my users will complain
[15:00:33] <mst> ohhh right because no fucking introspection yet
[15:00:34] <LeoNerd> Yes I know the users could have decided to put @ in there, but.. they'd have to remember that.
[15:00:49] * mst adds to xcl notes

[17:15:13] <mst> though I'd note Module::Runtime goes with 'use_module' and I do prefer that as a naming convention
[17:15:27] <mst> but, y'know, there's a difference between 'mst prefers' and 'mst SMASH'

[17:17:59] <pragma-> the goal is to, e.g., load_modules('PBot::Core::Commands') and it finds all *.pm files in PBot/Core/Commands/* in @INC. In fact, it's nearly identical to what neilb's Module::Loader does. I'm tempted to rip it out and replace it with Module::Loader, but I've already written it and I don't want to add another external dependency.

[18:15:03] <gordonfish> Re: <pragma-> I thought of it this way: a module is a single .pm file. a package is a namespace within a module. a class is package that has a subroutine to return a blessed instance of it. and a distribution is a collection of modules.
[18:15:07] <gordonfish> That's how I mainly know those terms too. I'd also throw in 'unit', which is any file pertaining to the project (.pl, .pm, .t, and perhaps template files) that contain code.
[18:15:34] <mst> not a term I'd ever use
[18:15:38] <mst> I'd just say 'file' for that
[18:15:48] <mst> as opposed to 'asset' for non-code files
[18:16:08] <gordonfish> I rarely, if ever, use 'unit' (save for as part of 'unit test'), it's just something I've seen in a lot of IDEs especially.
[18:17:01] <gordonfish> mst: Those are good terms, especially 'asset' for extra resources the project makes use of.
[18:18:18] <gordonfish> Thought the name 'unit test' does seem to imply the testing of specific units, typically modules, which could be said to be a unit specifically for packages.
[18:24:26] <Altreus> yeah but each method on a class is also a unit

[23:48:51] <pragma-> Kind of scary when you think about it -- the implicit trust necessary to use other people's libraries.
[23:48:59] <pragma-> It's not just a CPAN problem, it's all these package managers.
[23:49:21] <pragma-> It's just a scary thought.
[23:50:47] <tm604> we can avoid that situation by not vetting anything as safe in the first place \o/
[23:51:42] <pragma-> It's the thought that while I might be trusting a main package like XYZ::Whatever I have no clue if at some point in the future XYZ::Whatever starts depending on Another::Module and then later eventually Another::Module depends on Bad::Module and now XYZ::Whatever indirectly has Bad::Module as its dependency that it never really intended to have...
[23:51:59] <pragma-> Nor did I expect it to ahve.
