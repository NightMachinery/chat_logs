[22:25:51] <emanuele6> oh, with FS="/"
[22:26:49] <emanuele6> then   /imap/ && $9 >= 50 { cmd = "ls....."; while (cmd | getline line == 1) print a[split(line, a, "/")]; close(cmd) }
[22:27:40] <Earnestly> At this point, just use gawk and filefuncs
[22:28:37] <emanuele6> $9 is cpu percentage
[22:28:58] <emanuele6> > 50% cpu usage for something imap?
[22:29:26] <sptz> well is really 90 so i get all the users that use over 90% over time... 
[22:29:58] <sptz> and thanks! i will give this a go
[22:29:59] <emanuele6> oh, so imap is supposed to be the user
[22:30:32] <emanuele6> why are checking the whole line instead of just the user field? checking the whole line is weird.
[22:30:48] <sptz> will i sort out all the imap processes, then get the PID and CPU percentage. Then look up the name of the user on the bind mount of the proc folder.
[22:30:58] <emanuele6> also why are you even trying to do the whole thing in awk if you need to get the input from top-b anyway
[22:31:35] <sptz> emanuele6 well mostly to learn so i broaden my experience with awk.
[22:31:57] <emanuele6> just do everything in awk at this point
[22:34:28] <sptz> so usea system/cmd call with top -b  to get the fields from within awk?
[22:34:47] <Earnestly> Well
[22:34:55] <Earnestly> Why not just poll /proc yourself?
[22:35:27] <Earnestly> Why even involve top
[22:35:34] <emanuele6> i don't see the point of putting `|awk -F'/' '{print $NF}'' inside awk but not putting `top -b' inside awk to be honest
[22:35:55] <emanuele6> if you want to do everything in one awk command, do everything in one awk command
[22:36:19] <sptz> your probably totally right :)
[22:36:35] <sptz> just lack of skill i guess >) 
[22:36:37] <emanuele6> if you want to be silly, go full silly
[22:37:27] <emanuele6> either way, what is ls-lh for anyway?
[22:38:03] <emanuele6> you are using it as `readlink' that breaks for files with spaces?
[22:38:37] <emanuele6> # readlink /proc/self/cwd
[22:38:39] <shbot> emanuele6: bash: readlink: command not found
[22:38:54] <emanuele6> shbot does not have readlink :D
[22:40:40] <sptz> well yeah i can use readlink :) 
[22:41:15] <emanuele6> you must use readlink.
[22:42:55] <emanuele6> actually, maybe `ls -lh' will not break
[22:44:02] <emanuele6> # mkdir $'a\nb'; cd /; ln -s /root/a* h; ls -lh h
[22:44:04] <shbot> emanuele6: lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 9 Feb  4 19:14 99,9911,99h99,99 -> 12,99/root/a
[22:44:04] <shbot> emanuele6: b99,99
[22:44:09] <emanuele6> # mkdir $'a\nb'; cd /; ln -s /root/a* h; ls -lh h | cat
[22:44:10] <shbot> emanuele6: lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 9 Feb  4 19:14 h -> /root/a
[22:44:11] <shbot> emanuele6: b
[22:44:16] <emanuele6> no, it will break.
[22:44:36] <emanuele6> readlink would also break
[22:44:44] <emanuele6> well, no
[22:45:02] <emanuele6> because with readlink, you can just use system, you don't have to use getline
[22:45:05] <emanuele6> so you are fine
[22:45:41] <emanuele6> ah, nevermind, you want to remove everything before the last /
[22:46:30] <sptz> yep the last part is actually equal to the username from another system that i need to get. 
[22:47:25] <sptz> so the alex part of this line /nfs5035/data/ssd-093/al/alex 
[22:48:47] <emanuele6> so you would need to do something like:  readlink_output=""; while (readlink_cmd | getline line == 1) readlink_output=readlink_output line; close(readlink_cmd); if (match(readlink_output, /[^\/]+$/)) print substr(readlink_output, RSTART, RLENGTH)  either way
[22:49:01] <emanuele6> whether you use ls -lh or readlink
[22:49:12] <emanuele6> to get the correct value
[22:50:41] <emanuele6> or you could just use:   system("basename -- \"$(readlink /proc/" shquote($1) "/cwd)\"")

[23:37:23] <emanuele6> only for readlink-f 
[23:38:12] <emanuele6> readlink is a GNU coreutil so it is standard in GNU/Linux, but it is not a standard POSIX tool
