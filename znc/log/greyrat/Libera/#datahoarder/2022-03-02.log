[00:53:33] <Snuupy> does it allow for mesh connections behind double NAT'd devices? joepie91

[00:53:51] <Snuupy> Automatic full mesh routing
[00:53:52] <Snuupy> Regardless of how you set up the tinc daemons to connect to each other, VPN traffic is always (if possible) sent directly to the destination, without going through intermediate hops.

[01:07:44] <kron> Snuupy: the tinc android app allows overriding the DNS server per connection, so you can at least point it to an internal DNS host while connected
[01:07:56] <Snuupy> sounds less built in than netmaker/zerotier
[01:08:01] <kron> probably
[01:08:02] <Snuupy> more of an afterthought feature
[01:08:06] <Snuupy> thanks though
[01:08:17] <Snuupy> more established projects prob are more robust
[01:08:31] <Snuupy> maybe I should use arch for how edgy I want my software to be

[02:26:27] <cluelessperson> Does anyone have a suggestion for hardware for ZFS and JBOD?
[02:26:36] <evilgohan2> ???
[02:27:01] <cluelessperson> I guess I'm looking for something like a NAS solution that can handle like 12 disks.
[02:29:18] <evilgohan2> Off the shelf NAS? Pretty much your only option for that capacity is Synology. But Synology doesn't do ZFS.
[02:30:05] <cluelessperson> My plan is to install debian and ZFS, I just need a server for that many drives.
[02:30:25] <cluelessperson> Or maybe just a JBOD with a raid card in a smaller server.
[02:30:28] <evilgohan2> You *might* want to look at something like the Fractal Design Node 804 case
[02:30:34] <sarnold> are you thinking, building your own with your own case, your own motherboard, etc etc? or just grabbing a supermicro / dell / lenovo etc?
[02:30:42] <evilgohan2> Depends on the form factor
[02:30:56] <evilgohan2> Want a rackmountable formfactor / solution, you're grabbing at least a 2U
[02:31:13] <evilgohan2> otherwise, the Node 804 is quite capable: space for 2x 2.5" and 10x 3.5"
[02:31:36] <cluelessperson> sarnold, I want it to be quiet.   I could repurpose the 12 drive super micro I have.
[02:31:50] <evilgohan2> quiet? Then I would _definitely_ recommend the Node 804.
[02:32:04] <sarnold> heh the supermicro 3u that I've got I wouldn't call quiet :)
[02:32:29] <evilgohan2> cluelessperson: take a look at this case -> https://www.fractal-design.com/products/cases/node/node-804/black/
[02:32:40] <cluelessperson> sarnold, My 2U super micro is quiet because I ripped out the fans and replaced them with noctuas, and extras,  and I ordered their PSU upgrade that's quiet.
[02:32:51] <cluelessperson> it can be loud, but only when it's hot/high load.

[02:39:47] <cluelessperson> yeah

[02:41:25] <cluelessperson> okay, here's the deal.   I have ZFS raid_z2 with 12x 4TB drives.  This old supermicro has like 48GB of ram.   I'm looking to upgrade.  I'm thinking about a handful of 18TB drives.
[02:41:48] <cluelessperson> probably not 12 outright.
[02:41:52] <cluelessperson> but might.
[02:41:53] <rawktucc> just go 18TB
[02:42:44] <cluelessperson> yeah, but I'm thinking about the logistics of ZFS 12x18TB, vs like 8x18TB
[02:42:59] <rawktucc> what's the difference
[02:43:05] <rawktucc> you either get more or less data depending on your choice
[02:43:57] <cluelessperson> 12x18TB=215TB, 8x18TB=142TB

[17:02:16] <linearbit> zaggynl, I think the only thing I was concerned about is that I shut down the PC daily instead of having it run 24/7 which those enterprise HDDs are usually designed for
[17:02:59] <linearbit> not sure if the more frequent spin up/down is an issue durability wise
[17:04:48] <rawktucc> it can be
[17:05:03] <rawktucc> each spin up and spin down is a minor wear on the hardware
[17:15:45] <moo> maybe take care of airflow better
[17:18:18] <linearbit> I'm planning to keep 2x exos X18 in a drive cage right next to a 140mm fan
[17:19:28] <linearbit> so I doubt airflow should be an issue - I guess I'll just have to make sure there's enough space between them given that they are quite tall

[17:35:36] <linearbit> moo, oh that's good to know - I'm putting them into my Meshify 2 XL case so I should have plenty of space if I end up needing that
[17:39:07] <rawktucc> yeah never skimp on airflow
[17:39:25] <rawktucc> i can't remember why but one time I didn't run fans on two new 10TBs that I was joining to snapraid
