[03:20:22] <Bowuigi[m]> <JnValiska[m]> "What is the best/common way to..." <- In VimScript the usual way is `if exists(plugin_name_loaded) ...`
[03:20:52] <Bowuigi[m]> On Lua it is `vim.fn.exists` instead of just exists
[03:22:27] <ii14[m]> Bowuigi: you mean `exists(':BufferLineCycleNext')` probably
[03:22:44] <ii14[m]> you can't just give a plugin name
[03:22:51] <Bowuigi[m]> Oh
[03:24:23] <ii14[m]> the closest thing you can do to that is probably checking if it's somewhere in `runtimepath`
[03:25:18] <ii14[m]> some plugins have `g:loaded_<plugin>` or `g:<plugin>_loaded` variable, but that's just a convention and lua plugins in particular almost never do that

[03:25:40] <ii14[m]> the most reliable way is to get it from the plugin manager
[03:26:21] <JnValiska[m]> There is still problem conditionaly configuring keymaps since the plugins are loaded from `packer_compiled.lua` but I'm configuring keymap from `init.lua`. In that time there is no `packer_plugins` global table available nor `g:loaded_<plugin>`

[03:26:57] <ii14[m]> Ján Valiska: either set the keymaps after plugins are loaded or use <expr> mappings
[03:27:36] <ii14[m]> I believe packer has `config` attribute for that where you can give it a function that is executed after the plugin is loaded
[03:30:06] <JnValiska[m]> yes, the `config` attr can be defined for every `plugin`. But I need more general way to define mapping after `packer_compiled.lua` is loaded...

[03:33:19] <ii14[m]> and then just try to load it manually
[03:33:42] <ii14[m]> with lua's `dofile()` or the `:source` command

[03:38:06] <ii14[m]> you have to probably generate that dynamically for the absolute path
[03:38:11] <ii14[m]> doesnt have to be absolute

[03:38:53] <ii14[m]> but it's the safest way i guess if you have the same config on different machines with different environments or something
[03:38:55] <unclechu> The spellcheck file
[03:39:11] <JnValiska[m]> It seems to be working. Just changed `compile_path` and loaded by `dofile(vim.fn.expand('~/.config/nvim/packer_compiled.lua'))` at the end of my uncompiled plugin list file

[03:41:52] <ii14[m]> I believe `dofile()` doesn't throw when the file does not exist, and returns an error

[11:08:37] <Access[m]> About deno yesterday, I make a simple plugin to load importMap
[11:08:42] <Access[m]> https://github.com/chen244/deno-tool.lua
[11:09:39] <Access[m]> Because you said this unstable and should handle by plugin
[11:10:00] <Access[m]> So I make a simple tool,haha
[11:11:36] <Access[m]> And I found another problem. I found that lua lsp in coc has inlay, if nvimlsp has inlay too?
[11:11:44] *** Joins: xsteadfastx (~marv@94.31.99.245)
[11:11:56] <Access[m]> * inlay, if in nvimlsp, * nvimlsp it can has inlay
[11:11:59] <clason[m]> no
[11:12:10] <clason[m]> again, not part of the spec
[11:12:29] <Access[m]> I mean, if there is some plugin
[11:12:35] <clason[m]> but you can add it yourself (like https://github.com/simrat39/rust-tools.nvim)
[11:12:52] <Access[m]> I see

[11:14:28] <Access[m]> s/provide/provides/
[11:16:34] <clason[m]> why not? sumneko is very prolific
[11:23:38] <aphysically> oof gonna have to start maintaining plugin lists myself O__O https://github.com/sheerun/vim-polyglot/issues/779

[11:30:49] <ii14[m]> yeah seems like we'll have to port polyglot to neovim soon
[11:31:03] <ii14[m]> I'm already patching it because of filetype.lua
[11:32:40] <clason[m]> or -- and hear me out -- we could just curate the filetype plugins we need for the languages we actually use outselves?
[11:33:16] <ii14[m]> you mean just include syntax files from polyglot?
[11:33:34] <ii14[m]> I'm all for it
[11:33:43] <clason[m]> no, just install those filetype plugins that polyglot bundles manually
[11:33:53] *** Quits: dre (~dre@2001:8003:c932:c301:f5ca:6748:5b2:4153) (Quit: Leaving)
[11:34:09] <clason[m]> about half of it looks duplicated from Vim's runtime, the rest is just installing other people's plugins
[11:34:15] <ii14[m]> individual plugins are slower
[11:34:41] <ii14[m]> haven't check why exactly is that
[11:34:45] <clason[m]> that's what the author claims, but I find that hard to believe (unless you need 598 filetype plugins)
[11:34:46] <ii14[m]> s/check/checked/
[11:35:26] <clason[m]> and, yes, syntax files get contributed to upstream all the time
[11:35:29] <ii14[m]> I tested that and polyglot was faster
[11:35:42] <clason[m]> (for example, I see Julia in the polyglot list, which has been included in Vim for quite a while now)

[11:36:29] <clason[m]> is that still the case with bfredl's improvements to runtime path handling? I can believe that putting 598 separate paths in `rtp` will slow things down
[11:36:44] <ii14[m]> it's gonna be fun when they will start converting vim runtime to vim9script
[11:36:47] *** Joins: daniel-k3 (~daniel-k@fsf/emeritus/daniel-k)
[11:36:51] <clason[m]> they already have...
[11:37:17] <ii14[m]> are they doing it in syntax files too?
[11:37:27] <clason[m]> no, not yet
[11:37:37] <clason[m]> (since these are upstream even to Vim, so maintained elsewhere)
[11:38:12] <clason[m]> so I don't quite expect those to be converted for Vim 9.0.0000
[11:39:32] <clason[m]> but I do expect that Bram will make a concerted push to slap a `vim9script` on as many runtime files as possible before releasing Vim9 (which he wants to do soon™️)

[19:44:56] <kylo252[m]> speaking of speed, I just discovered that treesitter `foldexpr` is the one responsible for massive delay in formatting (easily over 2000ms)!
[19:46:26] <LeoNerd> Funny what performance improvments you get by having complex language parsing done by some compiled C code instead of a giant sprawling mess of regexps
[19:48:47] <kylo252[m]> background: I sometimes execute the format command by force of habit, and few times that I saw the delay were very large json files, so I just chucked it to jsonls being wonky. 
[19:48:47] <kylo252[m]> until I had formatted some file in neovim core and it was literally taking a few seconds to complete! and that's with clang-format. I dug everywhere in my config to try to find what the issue was, and couldn't find it until I started bisecting my settings. 
[19:48:47] <kylo252[m]> for contrast: I wanted to see if clang-format was the bottleneck, but it was literally faster to format neovim core files with vscode.........
[19:49:40] <kylo252[m]> I didn't have time to see if the issue is from `foldexpr` or treesitter itself

[19:54:53] <clason[m]> (I'm not saying that the treesitter foldexpr cannot be slow; it might very well lack the optimizations necessary to make it performant on those types of files.)
[19:54:56] <kylo252[m]> clason[m]: how do you mean? I don't really use folds, I just added that line because I saw it was available at some point
[19:55:13] <clason[m]> well, that for one is careless
[19:56:01] <clason[m]> (but I meant "using that term")
[19:58:35] <kylo252[m]> clason[m]: I wanted to get to that point, I think there might be a way to solve/improve this use-case for those who care about folds. when I was digging into the issue, I was looking into the implementation of `buf.formatting()` and `apply_edits()`. I actually think it might benefit from treating formatting the entire buffer differently from range-formatting. although I saw the same bottleneck from using `set_lines` vs `set_text`, so there's
[19:58:35] <kylo252[m]> more to it
[20:00:24] <kylo252[m]> the thing is, `foldexpr=nvim_treesitter#foldexpr` cannot be that slow, othewise it would've been noticeable. but something is different when `apply_edits()` is invoked.

[20:06:44] <clason[m]> This will involve a lot of tests with different combinations to find the minimal one, but that's how the cookie crumbles.

[21:00:12] <clason[m]> <ii14[m]> "maybe it's because it uses..." <- yes. it's used for lazy-loading, especially with dependencies, and setup/config of plugins

[21:01:50] <clason[m]> basically, the point is that you only need to load packer to do actual plugin operations, not for any of the lazy-loading

[21:02:03] <clason[m]> that means that you need another file for those
[21:02:19] <clason[m]> but it's slated for being massively slimmed down at some point
[21:03:16] <clason[m]> (funnily, it's pretty much exactly opposite to what vim-plug does: you need the plugin active for plugins to be loaded, so you need to put a special file in your default rtp...)

[21:09:17] <ii14[m]> <clason[m]> "(funnily, it's pretty much..." <- wdym
[21:09:34] <ii14[m]> I'm just doing basically the same thing that vim-plug does
[21:10:40] <ii14[m]> except I'm just avoiding accessing the filesystem as much as possible
[21:11:41] <ii14[m]> and when you specify something to be lazy loaded it's adds a handler, trigger, or whatever you want to call it that adds the plugin to rtp
[21:12:04] <clason[m]> I mean "think of `packer_compiled` as the equivalent of the `plug.vim` file you need to put in your autoload in order to bootstrap" -- just "reversed" due to how packages work
[21:12:28] <clason[m]> yes. packer uses native packages, which is a quite different approach to runtimepath mangling
[21:12:50] <ii14[m]> ah okay, I thought you meant vim-plug needs a special file
[21:14:29] <clason[m]> well, in a way it does: the plug.vim itself (since it's always loaded in your init.vim)
[21:15:07] <clason[m]> while packer-installed packages will work even when packer is completely disabled (deleted)

[21:17:32] <ii14[m]> sure. I was just wondering why is it slightly slower, and since I doubt it's packer_compiled.lua, it has to be the use of packages instead of rtp
[21:17:50] <clason[m]> mmmaybe

[21:18:01] <clason[m]> in the end, packages are still simply placed in rtp
[21:18:14] <clason[m]> (well, packpath gets added to rtp by Neovim)
[21:19:22] <clason[m]> could very well be the packer_compiled, although that takes just 0.3ms on my potato iMac
