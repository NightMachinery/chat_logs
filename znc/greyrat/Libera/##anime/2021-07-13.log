[01:42:42] <Omega037> Bco1981, bleh
[01:43:03] <Omega037> When I can actually understand 90% of someone speaking Japanese, I know they ain't legit
[01:43:36] <Bco1981> you have leveled up
[01:44:22] <Omega037> I wanna hear some offshoot of Osaka-ben spoken like a drunk salaryman, or I don't trust it
[01:44:34] <Bco1981> lol
[01:44:44] <Cryowolf> I want a remake of Record of Lodoss War
[01:44:47] <Omega037> I actually retain a very small amount of Sanuki-ben
[01:45:00] <Omega037> Enough to make someone from Tokyo get confused
[01:45:06] <Bco1981> there is only once i hace heard a thicc kansai-ben that i just did not get anything from
[01:45:16] <Bco1981> think it was in "Flying witch"
[01:45:19] <Bco1981> the dad
[01:45:21] <Omega037> "nan ga dekkyona"
[01:45:45] <Cryowolf> dont Kansai like to bend or draw out words?

[01:46:05] <Bco1981> moiiya
[01:46:30] <Omega037> nan shoun?
[01:47:38] <Omega037> It's weird because when you heard Kansai-ben on TV/Anime, it is usually an exagerated humorous usage
[01:48:20] <Bco1981> is korone kansai-ben ?

[09:32:16] <ButterNoodle> how many waves are there?
[09:32:27] <amigojapan> Who knows
[09:32:54] <amigojapan> Until everyone gets immunised at least

[09:38:48] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: but I think with people reluctant to get the vaccine. It could mutate to something the vaccine can't handle anymore. That's why it is important that everyone gets vaccinated quickly
[09:39:23] <ButterNoodle> I dont think thats how viruses mutate
[09:39:49] <amigojapan> They mutate at the time of reproduction
[09:39:57] <ButterNoodle> yes
[09:40:19] <amigojapan> Allowing it to spread is allowing it to reproduce
[09:40:38] <ButterNoodle> why do organisms mutate..
[09:41:49] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: failure to copy they DNA properly
[09:42:00] <ButterNoodle> they mutate to evade immunity... whether manufactured or natural
[09:42:14] <ButterNoodle> its their job to evade the immune system
[09:42:30] <amigojapan> No that is just a by product of mutation

[09:42:37] <ButterNoodle> incorrect
[09:44:24] <amigojapan> Anyway I am supposed to go to pick up some money to my cram school when I get the vaccine cause I don't want it weird
[09:44:39] <ButterNoodle> there are some decent peer reviewed papers -pre-covid- that discuss how pathogens are evolving and mutating as a result of vaccinations.. and medicine resistant strains of staff have evolved into killers over the past 20 years
[09:45:29] <ButterNoodle> mrsa is some bad stuff
[09:45:45] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: sure but the mechanism is still failure to copy the DNA properly
[09:45:47] <ButterNoodle> like flesh eating bacteria bad
[09:46:15] <theholyduck> ButterNoodle: i think its more bacteria evolving because of antibiotics than viruses evolving because vaccines
[09:46:48] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: vaccines have stopped pandemics before. Polio was when we were kids
[09:46:48] <theholyduck>  though ofcourse. lack of vaccination in certain circles does make it more likely  for a vaccine resistent variant to develop that then jumps into the vaccinated pool
[09:46:50] <ButterNoodle> probably so.. medicine has said fuckit to viruses over the years
[09:47:06] <theholyduck> ButterNoodle: so i think the problem might be more people NOT being vaccinated
[09:47:30] <theholyduck> i.e  anyone whos not vaccinated with covid. could get it .and then develop a mutated version that can pierce the vaccine

[09:47:47] <theholyduck> if we somehow could vaccinate everyone tomorrow that probably wouldnt happen
[09:47:49] <ButterNoodle> no one would have said that 10 years ago
[09:48:06] <ButterNoodle> groupthink
[09:48:14] <theholyduck> which part? 
[09:48:20] <theholyduck> anti-vaxers have been a movement for a while now
[09:48:36] <theholyduck> the original mmr autism thing was like late 90s
[09:48:37] <theholyduck> early  00's
[09:49:27] <theholyduck> but yeah like polio erradication is backsliding
[09:50:29] *** Quits: TheAceOfHearts (~TheAceOfH@24.41.239.76) (Quit: So long, and thanks for all the fish!)
[09:52:15] <theholyduck> we are so close though
[09:52:27] <theholyduck> in 2017 there was only 22 cases of polio world wide
[09:52:39] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: actually it has been proven that group think is more accurate than a single person thinking
[09:52:56] <theholyduck> amigojapan:  wisedom of crowds is different from groupthink
[09:53:01] <amigojapan> So groups think it but always wrong
[09:53:14] <amigojapan> I see theholyduck 
[09:53:24] <theholyduck> amigojapan: you are talking like  if you ask 1000 people to guess how heavy a cow is
[09:53:35] <theholyduck> the average is probably going to be almost exactly what the cow actually weighs
[09:53:36] <amigojapan> Right
[09:54:28] <theholyduck> GROUPTHINK is like where a group of people all refuse to disagree on something even though tye might 
[09:54:56] <amigojapan> Ah
[09:55:06] <theholyduck> or thats at least part of it 
[09:55:16] <theholyduck> basicly like everyone is pressured to stay within the accepted bounds of the group they are part of
[09:55:31] <amigojapan> I see
[09:56:23] <amigojapan> I stand corrected
[09:56:51] <theholyduck> amigojapan:  a cited example might be how almost no news organizations predicted donald trump would win the 2016 election
[09:56:57] <theholyduck> it was just "accepted wisedom" that hillary would win
[09:57:05] <theholyduck> even if a lot of the polling looked pretty close
[09:57:24] <amigojapan> I see
[09:57:55] <theholyduck> and nobody wanted to be the people who were like "no its serious. donald trump has a real chance of winning this
[09:58:27] <amigojapan> Gotcha
[09:59:08] <amigojapan> theholyduck: can trump run again next election?
[09:59:18] <theholyduck> legally sure?
[09:59:26] <theholyduck> he would have to win the 2024 primary
[09:59:41] <amigojapan> He probably will then
[09:59:54] <theholyduck> amigojapan:  i mean if nothing else to keep the donation train going
[09:59:59] <amigojapan> He will try to run at least
[10:00:18] <amigojapan> Right
[10:00:18] <theholyduck> amigojapan: the hope is that by the time election season goes around. hes so marred in legal troubles. and bankcrupt
[10:00:32] <theholyduck> that he cant really mount a effetive campaign
[10:01:00] <amigojapan> He still has many supporters tho
[10:01:00] <theholyduck> amigojapan:  also like. trump might be a turnout maker for himself. but he causes mass turnouts for democrats aswell
[10:01:27] <theholyduck> joe biden got the most votes of any democrat ever
[10:01:37] <amigojapan> I see
[10:01:54] <theholyduck> i think in large part because of how hated trump is
[10:02:02] <theholyduck> like biden is not a especially charismatic campaigner or anything
[10:02:16] <amigojapan> Right
[10:02:29] <theholyduck> amigojapan: like joe biden beat obamas best result tby like 12million votes
[10:02:36] *** Joins: Berlin36 (~Berlin36@user/berlin36)
[10:02:53] <theholyduck> soo. trump running again is goign to drive up republican turnout. but also a lot of anti-trump sentiment
[10:02:59] <amigojapan> People that had voted for him decided to vote against him this time
[10:03:17] <theholyduck> dunno how much of that there is :P
[10:03:31] <amigojapan> There has to be
[10:03:31] *** Joins: Nutjob (~Nutjob@user/nutjob)
[10:03:35] <theholyduck> donald trump 2020 got 12 million more votes than donald trump 2016
[10:03:53] <amigojapan> I see
[10:04:05] <theholyduck> and biden got 16 million more than clinton
[10:04:39] <theholyduck> amigojapan: the scary thing really is a) republicans are doing everything they can to make voting harder for 2024
[10:04:57] <theholyduck> and b) the supreme court in 2020 clearly signaled they were willing to engage in 2000 florida style schenanigans
[10:05:01] <theholyduck> if the opertunity called for it
[10:05:12] <theholyduck> the supreme court ruled that some types of ballots be set aside and counted later 
[10:05:17] <theholyduck> in key states
[10:05:30] <theholyduck> if biden hadnt been winning in those states on election night. 
[10:05:45] <amigojapan> I see
[10:05:46] <theholyduck> the supreme court would have stopped the coutning of those ballots
[10:05:54] <theholyduck> i have no doubt about it
[10:05:56] <amigojapan> Ouch
[10:06:20] <theholyduck> amigojapan:  sooo. thats my like 1 big fear for 2024
[10:06:24] <theholyduck> ratfucking the election
[10:06:56] <theholyduck> like joe biden got 7 million more votes than donald trump. but. he loses the electoral college if you swap 40k votes in a few states
[10:07:12] <amigojapan> Gotcha. Well I hope we don't get trump again. I hope he does not even run
[10:07:17] <theholyduck> and the republicans are setting up as many ways as they can to ratfuck that process
[10:07:36] <theholyduck> again like what happened to al-gore on the recount in 2000
[10:07:52] <amigojapan> I see
[10:07:54] <theholyduck> the supreme court stopped the recount when it became clear that the recount would flip florida from bush to gore
[10:08:03] <theholyduck> and thats how bush won the 2000 election
[10:08:42] <amigojapan> theholyduck: but I have heard even many republicans are against trump
[10:08:50] <theholyduck> amigojapan: in secret sure
[10:09:00] <theholyduck> amigojapan: but everyone who says anything against trump is basicly kicked out of the party
[10:09:03] <theholyduck> at this point
[10:09:13] <theholyduck> and the few who USED to be critical are now mostly kissing his ring
[10:09:17] <theholyduck> to avoid the same fate
[10:09:35] <theholyduck> amigojapan:  like theres always news stories about how all sorts of high ranking republicans hate the guy and what hes doing to the party
[10:09:44] <theholyduck> but they arent willing to say that in public
[10:10:19] <amigojapan> I see. Groupthink?
[10:10:42] <theholyduck> amigojapan:  maybe a bit :P but more like. just blind loyalty out of fear
[10:10:46] <theholyduck> like some north korea stuff
[10:10:56] <theholyduck> i imagine theres plenty of people in north korea who arent the biggest fan of kim jong un
[10:11:12] <theholyduck> but even remotely expressing that is ntot goign to bode well for you
[10:11:17] <theholyduck> sure in the GOP it results in being kicked out
[10:11:25] <theholyduck> rather than put in a camp
[10:11:39] <amigojapan> That is a huge difference
[10:11:45] <theholyduck> but being kicked out of your political party is rarely good for your political career
[10:11:52] <theholyduck> amigojapan:  its still somewhat career suicide

[13:57:36] <Bco1981> DunceCotus: and i'm too lazy to play games myself

[17:08:28] <Cryowolf> until you find one that has pfizer
[17:08:34] <Urchin[emacs]> hi KatrinValerie 
[17:09:05] <TsundereNoises> don't waste your time, it doesn't matter that much
[17:09:47] <DunceCotus> you have one vaccine you have them all
[17:13:52] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: the point of the vaccine is that it makes you LESS likely to get sick, AND if you do get sick, you basically will never get sick ENOUGH to wind up in the hospital, much less die
[17:14:39] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: and actually a lot of vaccines don't prevent you from ever getting at all sick, but in many cases they mean you don't show symptoms of whatever they're for, but usually those are against things that take longer to set in
[17:16:24] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: I thought getting covid would cause you to become immune to covid tho. But I have now heard of people getting covid more than once
[17:16:53] <TsundereNoises> basically vaccines just make your immune system faster at fighting off whatever it is, so if it takes a while to show symptoms you never "get sick" but if it is faster than you can get a bit sick but not as much
[17:17:14] <amigojapan> I see
[17:17:38] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: either a different variant, or they weren't that sick before, or their immune system is shit
[17:18:06] <amigojapan> Ah ok TsundereNoises 
[17:18:53] <DunceCotus> sick as a dog on tylenol 
[17:19:26] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: how come the vaccine can deal with stuff from several variants, aren't the variants newer than the vaccine?
[17:19:28] <TsundereNoises> also, as much as I hate to say it, there's also the issue of potential false positive test results
[17:19:56] <amigojapan> I see TsundereNoises 
[17:19:56] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: yes, but they have the same part of the virus that the vaccine targets in common
[17:20:00] <Cryowolf> I probably have pretty strong t-cells against covid, but soon as I can take a vaccine I will
[17:20:16] <TsundereNoises> I mean, I'd care more about b-cells...
[17:20:23] <amigojapan> Gotcha TsundereNoises 
[17:20:39] <Cryowolf> if my t-cells prevent it from infecting me in the first place
[17:20:53] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: we are getting the vaccine tomorrow
[17:21:00] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: viruses have little bits that stick up with unique shapes, that's what antibodies target, if that part stays the same, the same antibodies will work
[17:21:13] <Cryowolf> I'm just glad I have strong t-cells then cause getting sick after being in chemo for 4 cycles isn't something I want to try

[19:21:54] <Sadale> The intranet that the Cuban I know have access to contains a local wikipedia, a couple of local gitlab instances, etc.
[19:22:10] <prpldmn> pretty cool
[19:22:11] <Sadale> And there email access is far cheaper than internet access.
[19:23:46] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Cuba's government is kind of... idiotic would probably be the best description that comes to mind.
[19:24:16] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Then again I suppose I'd apply that qualifier to basically all authoritarians.
[19:24:54] <prpldmn> isnt it because of the US ?
[19:25:08] <Aurora_v_kosmose> prpldmn: Not exclusively, but they certainly didn't help.
[19:27:04] <Sadale> I'm surprised that they managed to develop their own covid vaccines tho
[19:29:06] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The primary obstacles to rapid tech development (at least until parity) are patent and copyright law.
[19:29:16] <Aurora_v_kosmose> If you ignore them both you get results quickly on the cheap
[19:29:30] <Sadale> stupid patent
[19:29:34] <Sadale> stupid copyright
[19:30:15] <theholyduck> Aurora_v_kosmose: i mean.. yes and no.
[19:30:35] <theholyduck> i think patent law is eminently useful for something like developing a new video standard. 
[19:30:46] <theholyduck> i dunno how closely you followed h265 development for instance. 
[19:30:59] <theholyduck> but patent law is sort of what makes something like that viable in the current world
[19:31:06] <prpldmn> but on medicine?
[19:31:17] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The FOSS world manages to standardize and innovate on its own without patents.
[19:31:34] <Sadale> FOSS FTW
[19:31:36] <theholyduck> Aurora_v_kosmose: sure. but much slower and much worse
[19:31:36] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Corporations don't like contributing to society and will try to avoid doing so as much as possible.
[19:31:38] <theholyduck> was my point
[19:31:45] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That is why your point exists at all.
[19:31:49] <Sadale> Those capitalist entities only care about money
[19:31:58] <theholyduck> Aurora_v_kosmose:  like theres a FOSS project to make something able to compete with h265 thats been going on for 10 years now
[19:32:02] <Sadale> Communist FOSS shall raise! :D
[19:32:05] <theholyduck> and its not even remotely there
[19:32:22] <theholyduck> Aurora_v_kosmose: the reason why patents is so useful for standards development
[19:32:38] <theholyduck> is that all the big players in the space. can put all their BEST people on full time developing new features to put in this thing
[19:32:46] <theholyduck> then all the best features get selected and put in it
[19:32:55] <theholyduck> but since its done in a open, public manner
[19:33:00] <theholyduck> only the best work goes in
[19:33:32] <theholyduck> intel submits this. apple submits that, 3 open source dudes in a basement submits this thing
[19:33:33] <theholyduck> etc
[19:33:44] <Sadale> Aurora_v_kosmose, hey comrade. We've got a capitalist duck here
[19:33:46] <theholyduck> everyone gets a patent on the thing they developed
[19:33:52] <theholyduck> that is part of the standard
[19:33:53] <Aurora_v_kosmose> theholyduck: And then no one can use it. Fuck them.
[19:34:03] <theholyduck> Aurora_v_kosmose:  except thats where the second part of this comes in
[19:34:16] <theholyduck> as part of this process everyone who gets their patent selected has to poool their patents
[19:34:32] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The idea of owning knowledge is abhorrent and nonsensical
[19:34:37] <theholyduck> into 1 patent pool controlled by a patent-pooling company
[19:34:51] <theholyduck> and thus there are no patent trolling or anything
[19:34:52] <theholyduck> involved
[19:35:03] <Sadale> I think that knowledge should be open to use for everyone as well.
[19:35:15] <prpldmn> closed knowledge hinders progress yes
[19:35:26] <theholyduck> sure but its not closed though. they publish the complete spec
[19:35:29] <Aurora_v_kosmose> theholyduck: So you're saying I can sell devices that incorporates h265 without paying any/absurd licensing fees?
[19:35:38] <theholyduck> and anyone can make competing implementation.
[19:35:47] <Sadale> It's like those mathematicians and physicians in the past. Back in the day patent didn't event exist. And there're still people working on them.
[19:35:54] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ^
[19:36:27] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The patent-pool still gets the ability to tell anyone but the direct contributors to go fuck themselves.
[19:36:29] <theholyduck> Sadale: the point in making here is that we are no longer in the realm of "this can be made by a few smart guys in a lab"
[19:36:35] <theholyduck> Aurora_v_kosmose: except they dont :P 
[19:36:37] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Which means that instead of a monopoly you have a cartel.

[23:22:15] <amigojapan> Roey: sometimes side effects are preferable to getting the disease itself without being vaccinated
[23:23:12] <Bco1981> i would rather take 14 days of being sick, then 6-8 months of "out of breath" condition
[23:23:33] <Roey> amigojapan: I mean specifically with inflammation and clots as a result of the vaccine turning your body into a spike-protein factory
[23:24:17] <Roey> mexen: btw! I love your smile!!
