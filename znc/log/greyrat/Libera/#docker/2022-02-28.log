[14:31:58] <tabakhase> the "should" there is a mixed bag...
[14:33:38] <tabakhase> also i think "in the literature" its only explicit about "not having a container do multiple things" - with the what-this-actually-means beeing an open Q :D
[14:35:18] <Tach> tabakhase I can't, my API is talking to wireguard through IPC... how would you do that differet ?
[14:35:23] <Tach> *different
[14:36:25] <tabakhase> https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#ipc-settings---ipc
[14:38:25] <tabakhase> but ye, ipc is "one of the few cases where bundling is often seen/accepted"  - and while that may break the "one process" rule, you often still totally fine hold the "one thing" rule
[14:41:22] <Tach> tabakhase how do you mean "holding  ?
[14:42:16] <tabakhase> this beeing "more a general no" is rly more about "doing it right is hard..."  - (youll find entrypoints that just do "someservice &" "someotherservice &" exec mainservice" all over github -- what will break horrificlly if someservice dies, or you need to restart someotherservice
[14:43:16] <Tach> tabakhase I could run a local monitoring,yes using supervisor or something else which is more lightweight
[14:43:28] <tabakhase> (also someservice and someotherservice can zombie out this way ;D)
[14:48:19] <Tach> hehe
[14:48:32] <Tach> shitty thing is indeed that your monitoring can die too
[14:50:53] <tabakhase> dont think ive ever seen s6 or so die without handing out its kill-signals :D - but technically, sure
[14:51:16] <Tach> hehe
[14:55:30] <tabakhase> but ye, as long as you do process/signal handling to cover the stop from the host, as well as reacting on failures/beeing able to restart individuals its usually "fine" - the Q. is much more "if you rly want this extra complexety if you dont rly need it"? - 99% can use network, even unix-sockets can be shared in volumes, and even ipc can be handled these days plus you loose all the fancyness 
[14:55:30] <tabakhase> of having images be there own packets and beeing able to manage things in docker directly

[18:33:15] <cart_> tabakhase: ^^
[18:33:30] <ada_> you can't specify that in a Dockerfile
[18:33:35] <ada_> you must set the volume at runtime
[18:33:56] <cart_> ada_: Where you able to at some point though? 
[18:34:10] <ada_> it's not specific to compose, you can use -v flag or --mount with the regular docker cli - but at build time, you can't (niormally) mount containers.  with buildkit, there is experimental support for mounts during build

[19:26:14] <driador> greetings all, quick question.  Dockerfiles:  I want to assign the output of a command to an environment variable that is then used later in a RUN statement.  For example, ENV RLS=$(lsb_release -c -s).  Docker acts like that's a syntax error, why? 
[19:27:22] <driador> the later RUN statement would look like:  RUN apt install foo-$RLS
[19:27:28] <driador> or something akin to that
[19:27:42] <ada_> because it is 
[19:27:56] <ada_> the ENV statement doesn't execute shell commands
[19:28:14] <ikke> And each RUN command is a separate process that cannot affect the environment of others
[19:28:20] <ada_> you could do something like `export RLS=stuff && command` instead
[19:28:25] <ada_> in a RUN statement
[19:28:42] <ada_> but, I imagine the package manager should figure that out on its own if you target a metapackage
[19:28:47] <ada_> what are you trying to install?
[19:28:56] <driador> gcsfuse
[19:29:09] <driador> for access to google storage buckets
[19:29:35] <ada_> so does `apt install gcsfuse` not work?
[19:29:41] <ada_> after setting up the right repo
[19:31:32] <driador> that's the thing, I'm trying to set the repo variable.  the author of gcsfuse has something like the export as you mentioned, but I don't think it's being evaluated properly when I reference it later (ie, adding that to an apt sources list

[19:48:39] <Tach> it seems you define on a container with which container you want to share it's memory ? But does needs to be done visa-versa /
[19:49:01] <driador> @ada_:  https://pastebin.com/EZDNyxRt
[19:49:38] <ada_> ok, so part of the proble msi because your RUN statements are separated, the exports don't live until the next step
[19:50:07] <ada_> each RUN gets executed in a separate shell, so an export from one doesn't carry to the next
[19:50:59] <ada_> what I might do to simplify this is actually something like echo "deb http://packages.google.com/apt $(lsb-release -c -s)" so I don't even need the export since you only ever use it once
[19:51:13] <ada_> RUN statements could be concatenated with && if they are part of the same "operation"

[19:52:53] <driador> meh, I should have realized that lol

[20:09:35] <ada_> make sure that your scripts/code emit logs to stdout/stderr 
[20:09:40] <ada_> yeah, w/r to your entrypoint
[20:10:07] <ada_> if you're going to run interactive, seems OK;  if you're running this as part of automation, you'd probably override the entrypoint with whatever you actually want to happen
[20:11:56] *** Joins: justAstache (~justache@user/justache)
[20:12:49] <driador> generally true, but our jenkins jobs change from job to job.  In this case I can spawn the container, run an ansible command with a given argument
[20:13:00] <driador> or playbook, etc
[20:13:11] <driador> a little more flexability I think

[20:33:13] <BtbN> You can make the export of the port only listen on certain IPs
[20:33:47] <BtbN> If you want multiple on the same port but different IPs, I think you can just have multiple expose arguments 
[20:35:46] *** Joins: vaio (~gary@user/ghost)
[20:39:00] <programmerq> expose does not publish the port. you would have --publish aka -p to publish ports to specific ips.

[21:21:09] <programmerq> say I have a host that has 192.168.1.22 and 10.0.0.33 that is running docker. 'docker run -p 192.168.168.1.22:80:80 ...' - this will publish the container's port 80 to the host's 192.168.168.1.22:80 but not to the host's 10.0.0.33:80
[21:21:17] <programmerq> and again, --publish and --expose are different things
[21:21:44] <programmerq> if you want to access a containerized service, you want --publish/-p and not --expose 
[21:22:14] <chipas> programmerq: i see, let my try ...  i had error before that's why i thought it impossible (google gives iptables only related results)
[21:22:47] <programmerq> if you don't specify an ip address when you do a port publish (like doing '-p 80:80') then it'll use the default publish address, which is 0.0.0.0 aka the "any address". You can tune the default address for a given dockerd instance if you want to.
[21:23:18] <programmerq> chipas: if you want to restrict who accesses a published port based on the source ip address, then you do indeed need to use an iptables rule on the docker-user chain to process your custom rules for the FORWARD chain.
[21:23:37] <programmerq> but if you just want a containerized service to be published to one interface and not another, then you can specify the host ip to bind to.
