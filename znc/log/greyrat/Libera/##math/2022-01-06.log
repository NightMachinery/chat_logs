[00:00:58] <bosspotato> setting a_n for the sum from i to n of sum(log(x_i)) and b_n the same for y, it amounts to saying that the limit of a_n + b_n is the limit of a_n + the limit of b_n which is fine because both are assumed to converge

[00:08:23] <Stefan26> i should be in the clear then either way it works then, because my factors are approximately like (1+1/n^2) or (1+1/n^3) and according to this https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1379947/what-is-the-definition-of-the-absolute-convergence-of-an-infinite-product-1a with a_n=1/n^2 ; i should be allowed to multipply them in before taking limit as series of 1/n^2 converges absolutely (I changed

[00:09:00] <Stefan26> (but I can't be rigorous about it without studying further)
[00:11:37] <bosspotato> the point is that you just take the log of the partial products to reduce to the case where you've got two sequences x_n and y_n and you want to know if sum (x_n + y_n) = sum(x_n) + sum(y_n) and the bottom line is yes provided that the two sums on the right converge

[00:42:21] <blackfield> scratch that, i think not, considering your answers :) thank you again
[00:42:23] <rak> the identity?
[00:42:47] <riv> if |M| is odd and f = g I think there is a fixed point
[00:43:13] <rak> Oh, never mind, I thought you meant given M, is there always an f : M -> M with a fixed point
[00:43:45] <Cale> If M is empty, the setup works, but you don't get a fixed point, because there's no point to be fixed
[00:44:41] <blackfield> well but in the example where g(0)=1, g(1)=0, there is no f which could satisfy both f o g = id and having fixed point

[01:10:36] <kmh> is it possible to have a differentiable function with its inflection ppoints being dense?
[01:12:01] <Cale> You mean a twice differentiable function?
[01:12:29] <Cale> There is a differentiable function where the set of points where the derivative is positive, negative, and zero are all dense
[01:13:05] <Cale> So by integrating that, you could get a function where the zeroes of the second derivative are dense
[01:15:49] <kmh> is requiring C^1 (continuously differentiable) good enough to exclude such a case?
[01:16:01] <johnkeats6> i think the general def of inflection point is where the derivative changes sign
[01:16:16] <kmh> yes
[01:17:26] <kmh> i sort of want to differentiate between tangent lines in inflection points and elsewhere
[01:19:55] <kmh> by saying that for tangent lines in non-inflection points locally the function graph is completely on one side of the tangent line
[01:21:07] <kmh> and i'm not quite what i need to require of a function to assure that this is true (and not killed by pathological case like having dense inflection points)

[06:52:42] <bosspotato> they're graphs without cycles

[06:53:31] <[itchyjunk]> they are also directed from top towards bottom?
[06:54:00] <bosspotato> they can be drawn like that sure

[17:48:41] <sek> edun: you don't need to use the germ definition in a first reading of this stuff. For an affine variety (or scheme) you can define O_X,p as the regular functions defined in an open neighbourhood of p. This is local ring with maximal ideal the functions vanishing at p, and one doesn't even need to mention sheaves. Then you prove that O_X,p is isomorphic to the localisation of the coordinate ring algebraically

[17:53:56] <edun> sek: yes I have done that proof.
[17:53:56] <edun> How I came upon this was because I was thinking since I already know that O_X(D(f)) is isomorphic to A(X)_f and the D(f) give a basis for the Zariski topology, could I not then use that in some neat way to prove this statement for the stalk? It seems to me that this is exactly what they use in this proof but it's a bit over my head unfortunately. I agree the whole sheaf thing might not be necessary but I'm really just looking to connect t

[18:04:08] <sek> edun: right. I guess you can still do that without sheaves or limits. If you define O_X,p to be the regular functions (ie quotients of polys) defined in an open nbhd, then you take a distinguished open D(f) containing p, and you're already working in an affine with coordinate ring A_f. Now you notice that any non-unit element in A_f which doesn't vanish at p will induce more functions regular in an even
[18:04:14] <sek> smaller nbhd of p, contained in D(f), so this way you may ...
[18:04:17] <sek> ... proceed by inverting all such non-units which doesn't vanish at p contained in A_f. What you end up with is A_p
[18:05:24] *** Joins: bitd (~bitd@user/bitd)
[18:05:38] <sek> then you just argue that every element (U, a/b) of O_X,p comes from this, by taking U\cap D(f) and taking the image of b in A_f to be your non-unit which doesn't vanish at p
[18:06:03] <sek> at this point one realises the sheaf way is just cleaner though, hah

[18:11:23] <edun> sek: thank you, this is really helpful! it's nice to also have the topological way even though I agree it is a bit messy... in my notes we introduce the K-algebra isomorphism of A(X)_f and O_X(D(f)) before sheaves are even mentioned, and then later on it is shown that O_X,p is a local ring using the other method, it just felt like perhaps there was some missed opportunity to use what was already known :)

[23:18:27] <Cale> Personally, I prefer to use the term "morphism" or "homomorphism" in cases where the arrows are in fact functions of some sort, though there's nothing which really says you need to do that.

[23:36:33] <mycroftiv> and it also seems clear its all very opaque and incoherent seeming, the motivation for doing things in agda is that theoretically it is very objective and the definitions are explicit and anyone can replicate all steps

[23:56:17] <Cale> mycroftiv: Yeah, especially without interactive tools to inspect things
[23:57:06] <mycroftiv> cale: yeah in agda, with my own code, i play around and evaluate things and it just barely makes sense to me, im well aware that without that its just symbol soup mostly
[23:58:04] <Cale> mycroftiv: Agda is a bit more readable in source form than Coq, but interactively stepping through a proof written by tactics in Coq is often somehow a lot more helpful than staring at terms in Agda for me.
