[05:17:55] <Guest4339> can earn more in ivy league tier finance or w/e
[05:18:35] <Guest4339> investment, research and using research data to launch several million company
[05:18:53] <Panther> Sounds like a snap. :)
[05:19:01] <Guest4339> not really
[05:20:14] <Guest4339> you have to do everything to extreme level for ivy admittance, graduate mit, harvard, go to usa naval research laboratory, darpa etc. and then once you get an idea of what you want, launch your company

[07:26:10] <laurus> Am I correct in thinking that even though matrix similarity fits the definition of conjugation a.la. group theory, it is not necessarily an automorphism by default since we would have to make sure it is "Structure-preserving" with respect to an algebra (i.e .preserves scalar multiplication of matrix, matrix addition, and matrix multiplication)?

[07:40:41] <krator44> depending on your definition of random
[07:41:17] <krator44> if you look at the way the blowfish cipher works more closely you'll see.. that it need not be particularly random anyway
[07:41:49] <krator44> but it does need some kind of a chaotic selection of digits
[07:42:12] <krator44> and nothing that the blowfish cipher does in any way connects to pi or circles.. or the binary digits of pi or anything like that
[07:42:46] <krator44> but my argument against the nothing-up-my-sleeve number is.. well why this number?
[07:43:10] <PlanckWalk> It's "random" in the sense that we can't find an overall pattern if the frequencies of digits or sequences of digits.
[07:43:11] *** Parts: laurus (~laurus@user/laurus) (Part)
[07:43:43] <PlanckWalk> It's definitely not "random" in the sense that we can't determine future digits.
[07:43:50] <krator44> what if the author tried e^2 and sqrt(2^5) etc. and found that pi provides the worst encryption
[07:45:04] <PlanckWalk> They might have tried sqrt(2^6)!
[07:45:31] <stanrifkin> :)
[07:46:04] <PlanckWalk> The idea is that the simplest nontrivial constant is also very unlikely to be the worst.
[07:46:25] <PlanckWalk> Well, unless it is so for mathematical reasons, like trying "0"
[07:46:58] <krator44> yea
[07:47:11] <krator44> i think thats a good argument
[07:47:37] <PlanckWalk> If the algorithm means that pi is the worst out of (say) a million constants, then you just got extremely unlucky.
[07:48:22] <PlanckWalk> The hypothesis that you chose your algorithm to make pi the worst is unlikely, unless there are lots of other free choices you coudl have made.
[07:48:58] <krator44> hmm
[07:49:01] <krator44> exactly
[07:49:03] *** Parts: seemsycamore (seemsycamo@gateway/vpn/protonvpn/seemsycamore) ()
[07:49:14] <krator44> actually that would be an interesting project
[07:49:47] <PlanckWalk> And even then, you're unlikely to be able to program a computer to find an algorithm that looks good to cryptanalysts, but has a weakness you can exploit.
[07:49:56] <PlanckWalk> Finding a *constant* with that property is easy though
[07:50:08] <krator44> actually exhaustively enumerate the other free choices to find one that makes pi the worst choice of constant
[07:50:49] <PlanckWalk> Or at least, easier.
[07:51:15] <krator44> anyway it goes without saying that in the case of blowfish it definitely doesnt look like thats what happened
[07:51:33] <krator44> the other choices are about the simplest choices that could be made as well
[07:52:00] <krator44> and if thats backdoored well.. its the least likely cipher to have been corrupted
[07:52:12] <PlanckWalk> Yes.  There's a very small "sleeve" to hide crafted weaknesses in.

[08:00:06] <stanrifkin> krator44: yes. i wondered why you didn't use mpfr and such

[08:20:16] <krator44> and looking into the blowfish cipher more closely you can see that the choice of constant is largely irrelevant anyway
[08:20:47] <krator44> so for example if you simply wanted to send messages to your friend and back and trusted that the constant was randomly selected
[08:21:02] <krator44> any constant would work
[08:21:24] <krator44> you could choose whatever constant you wanted without seriously impacting the security of the algorithm
[08:22:03] <krator44> (which isnt true in the general case where we cannot trust that the author of the cipher isnt fucking with us)
[08:22:39] <krator44> but broadly speaking feistel networks (basis of this cipher) have never been seriously broken and are thus far highly resistant to mathematical analysis

[08:36:35] <krator44> with different keys
[08:36:54] <krator44> that way all three would have to break (you can also do this with public-private key ciphers)

[08:39:56] <krator44> re-use of the same cd could lead to a break as well

[08:41:04] <stanrifkin_> read cryptonoicon?
[08:41:07] <krator44> i actually have a good idea for a solitaire - like cipher that seems more secure
[08:41:22] <krator44> stanrifkin_: yes
[08:41:50] <krator44> what you would do is this
[08:41:57] <krator44> divide the deck in half
[08:42:12] <krator44> divide right half of the deck in half again (quarters)
[08:42:23] <stanrifkin_> 13 then
[08:42:29] <krator44> yes
[08:42:47] <krator44> go through left half of the deck card by card and if you see a red card select from the left quarter (black card right quarter)

[08:43:12] <krator44> place right quarter on top of left quarter, then half on top of that.
[08:43:49] <krator44> actually half under that of course
[08:44:01] <krator44> you have just performed a controlled riffle shuffle of the deck using the one half to shuffle the other half
[08:44:10] <krator44> read the top card of the deck then repeat
[08:44:43] <krator44> so you might write the alphabet on every card and this will give you stream of letters basically.. which you can use to one-time-pad your message

[08:45:53] <xerxes_> hello
[08:46:15] <krator44> if you want more security perform a count-cut (read top card number (1-52) then cut that many card)
[08:46:38] <krator44> if you want less security and more performance.. i guess read several cards after each riffle
[08:47:04] <krator44> as simple as that
[08:47:08] *** Quits: xerxes_ (~xerxes@2601:c0:c300:4d20:991d:3985:6ba8:5754) (Client Quit)
[08:47:20] <krator44> of course your security will degrade quickly the more cards you read off of a riffle
[08:48:00] <krator44> here are we are using a heavier riffle than the real solitaire cipher (which takes longer) but that allows us to read several cards from each riffle
[08:48:23] <krator44> and we can actually adjust the convenience/security parameter
[08:48:41] <krator44> also i think its simpler to do it this way mechanically without thinking than the real solitaire cipher
[08:50:10] <krator44> when done in high security mode.. i wouldnt doubt that its every way as good as the real solitaire cipher
[08:50:31] <stanrifkin_> i'll try that. (** have to buy a deck of cards)
[08:50:36] <krator44> although of course.. i could be wrong. "everyone can come up with a cipher that they themselves cannot break"
[08:51:12] <krator44> hmm..
[08:51:27] <krator44> come to think of it the count cut is a must otherwise we are only permuting each half separately
[08:52:44] <krator44> or.. instead of a count cut you could do a left-right-left-right riffle of the two quarters and the half
[08:53:02] <krator44> to some way ensure every permutation is possible
[08:53:37] <krator44> either way we simply permute the deck in a controlled way
[08:53:45] <krator44> then we peek at the top card
[08:54:09] <krator44> you could try variations on this but i'd be surprise if you found a serious weakness with this approach that solitaire doesnt have
[08:54:27] *** Joins: karlosz (~karlosz@136.56.98.53)
[09:04:59] <krator44> for one i think this has a very good waterfall quality where small differences in the original deck arrangement cascade into substantially different permutations quickly
[09:05:49] <krator44> although i still suspect the count cut is hugely important to that end
[09:06:11] *** Joins: Fohsap_ (~Muimi@113.235.1.248)
[09:06:36] <krator44> anyway its a slight variation on the solitaire
[09:07:22] <krator44> i doubt anyone would break it even with full knowledge of the technique, and ciphertext, and availability of massive computing power (but not having the initial deck arrangement)
[09:07:26] <stanrifkin_> just calculated 54! in bit key length. 237 bits. right?
[09:07:36] <krator44> yes
[09:07:41] <krator44> thats abundant
[09:07:55] <krator44> 128 bit is considered industry standard unbreakable

[09:10:32] <krator44> (even if you used a single electron spin state to represent one bit, merely counted to 256-bit without doing anything else, and had access to free cooling to absolute zero which you dont)
[09:11:46] <stanrifkin_> schneier said it would be sqrt so 128
[09:12:07] <stanrifkin_> but with quantum computing you can't get any accuracy
[09:13:09] <krator44> sqrt is something else
[09:13:44] <krator44> you would expect to have a collision of 256 bit block cipher text after 2^128 blocks
[09:13:49] <krator44> due to the birthday paradox
[09:14:26] <krator44> or maybe something like that.. you would pretty much have to count to 256 bits if you were brute forcing the key
[09:15:31] <krator44> with the blowfish cipher after 2^32 (4bil) 64bit blocks (32 gigabytes) you would expect a birthday paradox collision of block ciphertext
[09:15:53] <krator44> (assuming you were running in say CBC mode)
[09:16:09] <krator44> which could indeed be a problem
[09:16:38] <krator44> i mean one way to handle it is to re-establish the encryption key every few 100 megabytes
[09:16:54] <krator44> so that you're not encrypting abysmal numbers of blocks with the same key
[09:17:05] <krator44> there could be other ways to handle it
[09:17:17] <krator44> or you could use a 128-bit block cipher to avoid the problem altogether
[09:19:33] <krator44> one conceivable attack is that you could take the ciphertext of the preceding block of the two colliding blocks
[09:19:58] <krator44> then the xor of these two ciphertext would be simply the xor of plaintext of the colliding blocks
[09:20:09] <krator44> (in CBC mode)
[09:20:27] <krator44> which might reveal a little bit of data in a 32gig sequence

[09:21:10] <stanrifkin_> can't calculate the key then?
[09:21:11] <krator44> you could also then perform a man-in-the-middle attack to alter that ciphertext in order to edit the underlying data in these two blocks
[09:22:06] <krator44> you mean if blowfish broke like this?
[09:22:10] <krator44> it wouldnt reveal the key no
[09:22:12] <stanrifkin_> ok
[09:22:16] <krator44> it would bleed a bit of data
[09:22:21] <krator44> and thats kind of bad
[09:22:23] <krator44> i guess
[09:22:48] <krator44> so we are using rijndael-128 aka aes as industry standard
[09:23:08] <krator44> but the mode in which a block cipher is used can be important
[09:23:32] <krator44> we could for example put randomly generated keys every some 100 thousand blocks
[09:23:34] <stanrifkin_> that was a problem with blowfish in the vim editor. it used ecb.

[09:24:10] <krator44> because there are other edit attacks
[09:25:19] <krator44> hmm..
[09:25:47] <krator44> wasnt double ratchet a meet-in-the-middle attack or something

[13:19:55] <anovick> Hey guys, I have a question in Infinitesimal Calculus (1). I'm trying to prove that the infimum of a sequence is 0. the sequence a_n is defined: a_1 = 1/2, a_n = sin^(n-1)(1/2) for n>1. i.e. it's the repeated application of sin function. I'm trying to prove the infimum is 0. any idea how to do this?

[13:27:07] <anovick> kamil1: it's not multiplication, it's composition
[13:27:24] <anovick> so sin(sin(1/2)) instead of sin(1/2) * sin(1/2)
[13:29:32] <kamil1> hmm, so maybe write sin as series around zero and apply q = 1/2 ?
[13:31:55] *** Joins: PJBoy (~PJBoy@user/pjboy)
[13:32:55] <anovick> I think I have a solution. it can be shown that a_n is decreasing, since the function f(x) = x - sin(x), is decreasing in (0,pi/2]. and a_n is bounded between 0 and 1. so we can conclude it is converging to some limit L>=0. also since it is decreasing, L is a lower bound for a_n. we get L<=a_n+1 = sin(a_n) <=a_n. the right hand side approaches L and therefore sin(a_n) approaches L. but sin(a_n) approaches sin(L), therefore sin(L) = L, which has
[13:32:55] <anovick> the only solution L=0.

[14:17:34] <Decker> buster :(
[14:17:40] <buster> cadmio, is the question "Show that any finite subgroup G of O_2(R) is either a cyclic group or a dihedral group"?
[14:18:22] <cadmio> buster: yes
[14:18:38] <cadmio> I'm following the proof from my text
[14:18:38] <Decker> I tested it in an incognito browser; I guess that wasn't anonymous enough

[14:20:21] <riv> it doesn't mention G at all
[14:21:05] <cadmio> let G ⊆ SO2 and let R_φ represents the counter-clockwise rotation of φ, with 0 ≤ φ ≤ 2π.
[14:21:12] *** Joins: goddard (~goddard@user/goddard)
[14:21:16] <cadmio> G is a finite group
[14:21:45] <cadmio> considering the rotation R_m such that m is the least possible value in radians, is R_m in G ?
[14:22:01] <goddard> if I have coordinates that have 1 origin point and I want to change the origin point any existing formulas i can look at that help with that? So i can convert my existing coordinates
[14:22:05] <riv> Ah, so G is a finite group - that is a subgroup of SO_2
[14:22:14] <riv> that means it is either C_n or D_n for some n
[14:23:22] <cadmio> the text says that G is completely contained in SO_2
[14:23:37] <riv> yes, G <= SO_2 does that
[14:23:49] <cadmio> and it justifies the fact that m exists because G is finite

[14:24:04] <cadmio> I'm not sure how the finitness implies the existence of the angle m
[14:24:51] <riv> goddard: if a point (p_x,p_y) is relative to origin point (o_x, o_y) and you want it relative to origin point (q_x, q_y) you can do change it to (p_x - o_x + q_x, p_y - o_y + q_y)
[14:25:37] <riv> cadmio: let g in G, g has finite order k (g^k = e), and g is in SO_2
[14:25:46] <riv> so g is either a rotation or rotation-reflection
[14:26:04] <riv> because that is what SO_2 is made of
[14:26:14] <riv> if it is a rotation then g must be of angle 2 pi / k
[14:26:35] <cadmio> so if I multiply that matrix R_m by itsels a finite number of times I get I the identity matrix?
[14:27:05] <riv> yes, k times

[14:50:32] <riv> the angle exists regardless of finiteness
[14:50:39] <riv> finiteness implies that the angle is a rational multiple of 2pi
[14:50:53] <riv> every rotation or rotation-reflection in SO_2 has an angle
[14:51:19] <riv> when g^k = e, we know that the angle is 2pi / k (for the simpler case of a pure rotation)

[14:55:23] <riv> yes that is exactly in agreement with what I said

[14:57:59] <buster> let theta be the smallest element. then theta/2 is an element smaller than it: contradiction.
[14:59:53] <kamil1> what about -1 ?

[15:00:57] <riv> goddard: ok
[15:00:57] <cadmio> right so it does not make much sense along with that argument about the finitness of G
[15:01:17] <goddard> basically i have a 0,0 position of my grid at the top left, but I want to translate that to the bottom left is that correct?
[15:03:56] <riv> oh that is more than just moving the origin
[15:04:05] <riv> you're also flipping the y axis of the coordinate system
[15:04:29] <riv> so if the height of the window is h, you need to map (x,y) to (x,h-y)

[15:09:11] <buster> cadmio, if the question is still "Show that any finite subgroup G of O_2(R) is either a cyclic group or a dihedral group", you will need to use the finiteness of G somewhere in the proof. because without that word "finite", the statement is not true.
[15:09:44] <buster> counterxample: O_2(R) is a subgroup of O_2(R) and O_2(R) is neither a cyclic group nor a dihedral group.

[18:40:32] <Z-module> hi again
[18:41:35] <cadmio> hey Z-module I need your take on a proof
[18:41:46] <Z-module> okay
[18:42:55] <cadmio> the part in bold http://mathb.in/69233 the fact you can pick the smallest angle because G is finite
[18:43:04] <cadmio> it seems weak to me
[18:43:19] <Z-module> People told you earlier today. ANY finite set of reals has a smallest element.
[18:43:51] <Z-module> If you like, we can give a formal proof of that, using induction on the size of the set.
[18:44:05] <cadmio> yes but you can divide μ and you've a smaller one
[18:45:01] *** Joins: roadt (~roadt@60.166.72.94)
[18:45:21] <Z-module> each g in G gives some single angle, a number in [0, 2pi).  We are avoiding 0 since g is not e. There's at least one nonidentity g since G is assumed nontrivial. So there are |G| - 1 reals, one for each nonidentity g, each of them in (0, 2pi).  Find the smallest, and use the corresponding g for that.
[18:46:13] <cadmio> yes g is characterized by an angle but it's a matrix
[18:46:30] <Z-module> (the proof should start out with [0, 2pi), not [0, 2pi], since rotation by 2pi is just the identity -- same as rotation by 0 )
[18:46:57] <Z-module> We are using the associated reals (the angles)

[18:47:45] <Z-module> and the association  g |-> the angle in [0, 2pi) that g rotates by      is injective: two rotations with the same exact angle in there are the same rotation -- the same element of SO_2
[18:48:54] <cadmio> if G was infinite what would change? why the existence of the smallest angle in bound to the finiteness of G?

[18:50:11] <Z-module> If we use the standard basis {(1,0), (0,1)} for R^2, then these matrices in your G, written w.r.t. this basis, are jsut  [cos(theta), -sin(theta); sin(theta), cos(theta)]  which gives the rotation by theta (where positive means counterclockwise rotation).
[18:50:45] <Z-module> consider G = the full SO_2, uncountably many matrices. Every single theta in [0, 2pi) occurs here. There is no smallest nonzero value in there.
[18:51:00] <Z-module> They want smallest nonzero, only, for this proof
[18:51:11] <Z-module> that is, the rotation for a nonidentity element of G

[18:51:56] <Z-module> or you could look at G = {rotations through just rational multiples of pi radians}, a countably infinite subgroup of SO_2. Here again, no smallest positive angle is in there.
[18:52:13] <cadmio> I didn't understand the last why G = SO2 has no smallest, since the domain is always [0, 2pi)?
[18:52:22] <Z-module> smallest NONzero
[18:52:34] <Z-module> 0 is of course the smallest real in [0, 2pi)
[18:52:41] <Z-module> but we are only looking at nonzero things in this proof
[18:52:46] <cadmio> sure
[18:53:44] <Z-module> For G = SO_2, every single real in [0, 2pi) occurs. So for any r > 0 in there, we can look at r/2 instead, which is positive and < r.  Etc forever. THere is no smallest.
[18:53:53] <Z-module> (no smallest nonzero)
[18:53:57] *** Joins: MajorBiscuit (~MajorBisc@c-001-023-057.client.tudelft.eduvpn.nl)
[18:54:43] <Z-module> SO_2 is the group of all possible rotations, for all possible angles
[18:54:52] <Z-module> that gives all the reals in [0, 2pi)
[18:56:29] <cadmio> ah ok since G is a proper subgroup of SO_2 it has not all the elements of SO_2 but only a finite number
[18:57:06] <cadmio> and among those finite element take the one such that phi is the smallest positive angle (matrix related to that angle)
[18:57:10] <Z-module> It is *given* to be a finite subgroup.  Being a proper subgroup by itself does not imply that.
[18:57:31] <Z-module> SO_2 has zillions of infinite subgroups, including zilions that are uncountable.
[18:58:19] <Z-module> (in fact, I learned recently that every uncountable abelian group A, whatosever, has a proper subgroup of cardinality |A| , a thing not in general true without the abelian part)

[18:58:46] <Z-module> anyway, yes for what you just said
[19:00:42] <cadmio> thanks, now I understand that part
[19:02:40] <Z-module> and then the rest of the proof amounts to: If g has the smallest-occurring positive angle, the cyclic subgroup <g> has to be all of G, since otherwise you can show a still-smaller positive angle would occur.

[19:25:51] <bildramer> I'm assuming there is a way to make these steps "continuous" and "happening at the same time", and if not, you can approximate that by dividing the k, x values appropriately and alternating steps

[19:30:33] <bildramer> x/k is probably the parameter of interest. so starting out, e.g. with x=5, k=0.5, you have a distribution that's a flat 1 over [0,1], then it's a flat 1/0.95 over [0,0.95], then it's (1/0.95+1)/2 in [0,0.95] and 1/2 in [0.95,1], and then comes the interesting part where the new chopping off point is at <0.95 because that's less than 0.05 of mass at >0.95

[21:48:14] <[itchyjunk]> Index of H in G [H:G] is defined as |G|/|H| ?
[21:48:17] <Z-module> and the index  |G : {e}|  is always |G|, of course
[21:48:24] <[itchyjunk]> ah
[21:48:25] <[itchyjunk]> right
[21:48:38] <[itchyjunk]> ah its [G:H]
[21:49:20] <Z-module> (1) the notation always puts the full group first:  [G:H], or |G:H|, or occasionally (G:H) ;   (2) it's defined as the cardinality of the {all left cosets gH : g in G},  which can be infinite. *IF* G is finite, then it also = |G|/|H|
[21:50:00] <Z-module> or you can use all right cosets -- you always get the same thing as for left

[22:04:02] <[itchyjunk]> hmm
[22:04:54] <Z-module> Thus, for example, the infinite alternating group {p in S_N : p moves only finitely many symbols and is an even permutation on those}  has no finite-index subgroups besides itself, since it is simple.
[22:09:05] <riv> Z-module: you mean normal subgroups?
[22:09:15] <[itchyjunk]> the {2n: n in Z} was an alternating group right?
[22:09:21] * [itchyjunk] forgot alternating groups
[22:09:50] <Z-module> riv, at all, because of the fact I just stated about finite-index ones
[22:10:23] <Z-module> any finite-index subgroup of an infinite group G has cardinality |G|, so it can't be {e}

[23:10:06] <Guest1778> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_delta_function#Properties
[23:10:11] <Guest1778> Thanks
[23:10:16] <mefistofeles> ha yeah, there you go
[23:18:13] <blackfield> how would one prove that for every surjective map f:X->X there exists g such that f \circ g = id ?
[23:18:33] <riv> start with definition of surjective
[23:18:53] <riv> f surjective means that for all y in X, there exists x in X where f(x) = y
[23:19:22] <riv> this can be encoded as a function g, g(y) = x with the property that f(x) = y
[23:19:29] <blackfield> ∀x∃y x=f(y)
[23:20:09] <riv> hm something went wrong
[23:20:20] <riv> I got g(f(x)) = x but you have f o g = id, i.e. f(g(x)) = x
[23:20:23] <riv> and I think both are wrong?
[23:20:33] <riv> you need to find a subset of X
[23:20:46] <blackfield> X is just any set
[23:20:48] <riv> (unless it's finite)
[23:21:05] <Ox5cfb> the initial statement is false
[23:21:06] <blackfield> call it A if X is confusing :) finite or nonfinite, any
[23:21:15] <riv> sure but consider something like f(x odd) = 0, f(x even) = x/2
[23:21:17] <riv> it is surjective
[23:21:33] <riv> but you can't find a right inverse
[23:23:51] <blackfield> did you mean to put floor or ceiling function there?
[23:24:13] <blackfield> x/2 isn't a whole/natural number
[23:24:27] <riv> it is
[23:24:30] <riv> x is even
[23:24:41] <blackfield> oh right
[23:24:47] <riv> you could use floor for another good example
[23:25:02] <riv> let's consider more generally f : X -> Y
[23:25:19] <riv> when does a left inverse exist,  l o f = id,   when does a right inverse exist  f o r = id
