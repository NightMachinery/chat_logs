[05:46:58] <wedr> Hi again. Yesterday, I asked about a song I couldn't remember, right? That's all fixed now. Song name is: "Piece of my Wish - Imai Miki".
[05:47:16] <wedr> So.... what is this song's importance in anime?
[05:48:22] <wedr> It all spawned with me tracking down subtitle footnotes. That's when the melody hit me, and I had it stuck in my head for so so long, such that I feel like I'm a creep.
[05:49:05] <wedr> But now, that's all good and done, I realized footnotes in both manga and anime subtitles are a wonderful way to pass information down to readers/viewers
[05:49:44] <wedr> Perhaps, there is some conspiracy where hidden messages are passed around in various anime series, that it colludes to some "Silk Road" of clues?

[07:58:47] <klaxa> for my current one i just never unwrapped the cable and i think that reduces strain a lot

[12:59:46] <saganman> one rape scene doesn't count as hentai or fanservice amigojapan 
[13:00:01] <saganman> for example take goblin hunter
[13:00:25] <amigojapan> saganman: I agree abotu fanservice, but rape it pretty bad, and i think it takes it as low as ero anime
[13:00:51] <amigojapan> saganman: you dont want children watching goblin hunter anyway
[13:01:09] <amigojapan> saganman: it is nto any more wholesome than hentaiu
[13:01:23] <Matt|home> that sounds really boring..
[13:01:25] <saganman> I agree with not being appropriate for kids but is it ero anime?
[13:01:31] <Matt|home> hm
[13:01:50] <Matt|home> i'll rewatch season 1 of my hero. i kinda hate shonen (shounen?) but honestly i enjoy this particular series so far
[13:01:54] <amigojapan> no saganman , but this is just a morality scale
[13:02:20] <amigojapan> saganman: peverted things are mixed with violence
[13:02:33] <Matt|home> nooooes i dropped my strawberry flavored fake candy ;_; it's on tne flooor.. dammit
[13:02:40] <amigojapan> saganman: I could seperate it
[13:02:40] <saganman> Matt|home: I can't see why not. My hero has done everything right in being shounen. 
[13:03:01] <Matt|home> you know during one of my labs i made different esters and quite a few of them were flavorings :D
[13:03:08] <saganman> amigojapan: I see
[13:03:15] <Matt|home> methyl cinnamate tasted and smelled like suuuuper fake generic candy tho
[13:03:18] <Matt|home> but i love it <3
[13:03:48] <amigojapan> saganman: murder is less bad than rape tho, in the morality scale of mine
[13:03:50] <Matt|home> saganman : too many charactersin later seasons for me to be emotionally invested in anyone except the main lead tbh, that's my main criticism
[13:04:25] <amigojapan> saganman: in real life probably wose, but not in anime

[14:10:08] <amigojapan> saganman: what I dont like about matrix, is that it ads [m] to our nick
[14:10:17] <Bco1981> yeah, i tried getting packages from the current, but it couldn't install the lilo, was missing a older glibc
[14:10:24] <amigojapan> saganman: that woudl suck about quotes
[14:10:40] <Bco1981> and i couldn't find a way to uopdate from latest iso to current
[14:11:03] <Bco1981> no "software/package/update" feature i could find in the menus

[14:13:19] <saganman> with slackpkg I mean
[14:15:27] <saganman> and also the thing about missing glibc is you gotta download the glibc you want directly to your libs or whervever the place is Bco1981 
[14:15:34] <amigojapan> saganman: I have 7 tabs open in firefox, and VScode open and i sill have 3.3 GB or ram left :)
[14:15:47] <Bco1981> saganman: that's hard to do during the initial install
[14:16:21] <saganman> you got missing glibc during initial install?
[14:16:26] <saganman> that's odd
[14:16:53] <amigojapan> Bco1981: why slackware?
[14:17:00] <saganman> If I remember correctly slackware by default has glibc solibs
[14:17:28] <Bco1981> i used the 64 14.2 iso to start the install. then chose ftp and tried to get the current slackware64. at the end when it tried to install lilo. that's when it complained it couldn't because it was missing a glibc version
[14:18:02] <Bco1981> amigojapan: i used to use slackware back in the day my self. and i used it on a 486 to make it into a firewall/router
[14:18:11] <saganman> you can download from ftp site using wget or installpkg
[14:18:14] <Bco1981> so i wanted to see what current slackware was like
[14:18:30] <Bco1981> saganman: during the initial install i don't really have that option
[14:19:08] <saganman> hmm, I don't know. You gotta ask the peeps in ##slackware
[14:19:18] <amigojapan> Bco1981: I used it somewhat too, but i cant believe it is as good as a modern linux distro

[14:32:07] <saganman> If this succeeds you can mod this into giving recommendations for anime
[14:32:50] <saganman> There should be more questions to scale the anime.
[14:33:01] <amigojapan> saganman: maybe I can make an "embed this on your site" thing like youtube, anbd mal and other such sites can embed my system on their page

[15:06:34] <amigojapan> yeah digital-man , I got to work with all kinds of strange hardware, that was fun, sine I like tinkering with computers anyway, my boss would buy used servers from companies, we woudl max them out, and resell them in akihabara and yahoo auctions
[15:13:43] <amigojapan> Bco1981: my laptop is old, I am used to working on large computers, how hard would it be to change the grease on a laptop? I imagine it is time 
[15:14:47] <Bco1981> depends on how well they built it... like some laptops you just remove one plastic cover, then you have access to the cooler which is easy to remove.
[15:14:55] <Bco1981> then there is the olther type.
[15:15:26] <Bco1981> remove the monitor, remove the keyboard, remove the plastics laptop top cover.
[15:15:48] <Bco1981> pull out the motherboard in order to get to the cpu cooler underneath
[15:16:17] <amigojapan> ouch Bco1981 , how do i tell the difference?
[15:17:11] <Bco1981> you find out underneath the laptop, start with whate ever large plastic parts you can remove. that is covering the cpu cooler
[15:17:33] <Bco1981> if you can't get to the cooler just like that... you have a long way to go.

[17:19:24] <snake> amigojapan, ok
[17:19:54] <saganman> amigojapan: how do you classify Ranma according to that questions? it has everything.
[17:19:59] <amigojapan> snake: the manga is only 16 volumes
[17:20:13] <snake> i see, that is better for me
[17:20:50] <amigojapan> saganman: I would need to do the math, but it woudl come up with a number at the end
[17:22:48] <amigojapan> snake: tomako searched it says 38 volumes, so I guess that it may be differnt in english and japanes

[17:27:11] <amigojapan> lastonestanding: I look at people person to person
[17:27:18] <lastonestanding> "Millennials have been described as the first global generation and the first generation that grew up in the Internet age."
[17:27:27] <lastonestanding> we grew with the internet
[17:27:33] <lastonestanding> and the internet makes us stupid
[17:27:39] <lastonestanding> so...
[17:28:03] <amigojapan> the inernet should help you to be smart lastonestanding 
[17:28:14] <amigojapan> its a tool for learning
[17:28:19] <lastonestanding> I wonder if that is true
[17:28:31] <lastonestanding> we let the internet be smart
[17:28:41] <lastonestanding> and query it for information
[17:28:41] <amigojapan> lastonestanding: it depends on which pages you read tho
[17:29:13] <amigojapan> the internet has lots of false information, so it is good to be skeptical about it

[18:38:55] <amigojapan> MootPoot: go to file uploads menu item, click it, then you can see an X to the right of each menu item
[18:38:56] <MootPoot> whare are my uploads
[18:39:10] <amigojapan> MootPoot: on the server
[18:41:09] * Bco1981 starts arch install
[18:41:23] <saganman> you can click on uploads and snippets and go to file uploads
[18:41:28] <saganman> MootPoot: ^^
[18:41:32] <amigojapan> Bco1981: crh is a rolling distro
[18:41:45] <Bco1981> yeah, just testing in a VM
[18:41:47] <amigojapan> arch*
[18:41:53] <amigojapan> ok Bco1981 
[18:42:13] <amigojapan> Bco1981: have you tested linux mint, cinnamon?
[18:42:17] <saganman> Bco1981: if you have 99 problems, arch will be 98 of them
[18:42:47] <Bco1981> amigojapan: at my old work we had two test laptops that ran linux mint
[18:43:04] <amigojapan> ah ok Bco1981 
[18:43:21] <saganman> mint is debian based right?
[18:43:23] <amigojapan> Bco1981: mint is known as "ubuntu done right"
[18:43:33] <amigojapan> saganman: it is ubuntu based
[18:43:42] <amigojapan> which is debian based yes
[18:43:47] <darkwitch> we established that mint is a poison too
[18:43:48] <saganman> oh yeah, I remember it now
[18:43:53] <Bco1981> great... not very userfriendly... boot up the iso, go to archwiki and follow the installation guide...
[18:44:18] <amigojapan> Bco1981: gross
[18:44:24] <Bco1981> so
[18:44:34] <emmeka> I've never attempted to install Arch, because I'm 99% certain I'll break it
[18:44:40] <saganman> that's least of the worries actually, Bco1981 
[18:44:43] <Bco1981> you can't install this Os without a 2nd computer
[18:44:44] <emmeka> I'm happy in pleb territory
[18:44:47] <Bco1981> w t f
[18:44:50] <saganman> wait until you start using arch
[18:45:02] <emmeka> Bco1981 well, you can memorize how to do it, like a certain buttery noodle
[18:45:19] <Bco1981> yeah, but that wont help a first time user
[18:45:31] <saganman> I can't remember the number of times where upgrading packages broke my system
[18:45:33] <Bco1981> now i'm lucky i have plenty of other pc's here
[18:45:41] <Bco1981> that's not everyone that has that
[18:45:50] <saganman> and the number of times trying to fix the installation
[18:45:55] <emmeka> saganman I'm generally not a fan of rolling release for this reason
[18:46:08] <amigojapan> saganman: that si what happened to me with manjaro, and it is arch based
[18:46:23] <amigojapan> emmeka: I have joined your club
[18:46:24] <snake> might install gentoo, dunno
[18:46:25] <emmeka> I'd rather have big updates periodically that I know are likely to break things, than have to be ready to anticipate and fix something breaking every day
[18:46:36] <emmeka> amigojapan oh? fedora user now?
[18:46:37] <snake> nah lol
[18:46:43] <saganman> there are other rolling release but arch is fantastically bad
[18:46:45] <snake> perhaps something normal like ubuntu
[18:46:54] <amigojapan> emmeka: no, linux mint, cinnamon
[18:47:17] <emmeka> amigojapan Mint was the first linux distro I ever used, in Vista times.
[18:47:29] <emmeka> but I feel like it's kind of bloat-y
[18:47:41] <amigojapan> I see emmeka , mint is know ans "ubuntu done right"
[18:47:51] <MootPoot> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/0ZbohwKO/20211017_024644_HDR.jpg
[18:48:14] <emmeka> it's more like Ubuntu but with the noob dial turned from about a 7 to a 10
[18:48:21] <saganman> wow snake, I commend your bravery on trying gentoo
[18:49:25] <amigojapan> nice MootPoot you made a Japanee tea cup with wabisabi, with some garnish plants
[18:49:43] <snake> no comment
[18:50:04] <saganman> Slackware is the OS for me. It doesn't tell me what to do and is just as much lazy as me.
[18:50:30] <emmeka> saganman old school.
[18:51:01] <saganman> Once the set up is done, you can leave it for like for like years and decades without any problems
[18:51:07] <emmeka> saganman doesn't slackware make you like, find dependencies yourself and shit
[18:51:29] <MootPoot> WOAH ITS EMMEKA
[18:51:36] <MootPoot> lol amigojapan that was a mistaken upload
[18:51:40] <MootPoot> I accidentally clicked send
[18:51:42] <emmeka> this loses its effect when you say it every day
[18:51:54] <amigojapan> ah ok MootPoot , but ti was niced
[18:52:05] <saganman> emmeka: only if the package isn't in slackpkg besides you don't need all the dependencies. The other distros shit on you telling you to install all the shit.
[18:52:57] <saganman> most of the frequently used packages are in slack package manager
