[01:14:59] <djacobs> Are there any users of gitlab who use the cicd-functionality?
[01:15:31] <dodo> what would you ask them?
[01:15:37] <djacobs> I've ran into an issue of which i suspect its my own damn fault, and is more python-environment (host) related than gitlab
[01:16:26] <djacobs> well, i've basicly created a cicd file which will copy the django application, and run it!  it works perfectly (for running tests), however make migrations doesn't detect the models...

[01:17:03] <djacobs> which also explains why my tests succeeds, since they're not detected (i expected a simple and plain failure) :)
[01:18:08] <dodo> you should probably share your file, see /topic for a pastebin
[01:18:17] <djacobs> it's build on the python-image (alpine3.13), on which the requirements are installed through a pip!  The only thing that differs from my dev-setup is that i'm not using an venv
[01:19:39] <djacobs> https://dpaste.org/
[01:20:18] <djacobs> i've added some commands in the before_script part to be able to inspect the actual environment, but it should be ok!

[01:21:17] <djacobs> Maybe i should move the pip command along with the makemigrations in a seperate build-job instead of the before_script....
[01:21:19] <dodo> that's just the site, not your paste
[01:21:27] <djacobs> ugh sec! :D
[01:21:34] <djacobs> https://dpaste.org/BRKN
[01:21:41] <djacobs> I'm sorry! :d
[01:23:15] <dodo> fwiw, makemigrations should never be part of your ci, migrations belong in the repository
[01:23:38] <djacobs> What do you mean in the repository?
[01:23:56] <dodo> they should be part of the source code of your app
[01:23:58] <djacobs> Keep in mind that i'm only using this to test my code automaticly, not for actual deployments
[01:24:12] <dodo> yes
[01:24:12] <djacobs> Maybe thats the issue
[01:24:27] <djacobs> if i remember correctly i didn't copy the migrations directory in the source
[01:24:33] <dodo> you really should
[01:24:45] <dodo> also you don't need to migrate yourself for running tests
[01:24:47] <djacobs> I'm a dumbass, but at least now i know it! :D
[01:25:28] <djacobs> well i just noticed i wasn't seeing the objects so i added it as a before_script task
[01:25:30] <dodo> i'm not sure though why they aren't build.. or why the test runner doesn't find tests
[01:26:36] <dodo> perhaps the settings file is not the correct one?
[01:26:59] <dodo> fwiw, try setting DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE explicitly?
[01:27:23] <djacobs> https://dpaste.org/kwmc this is the joblog of my last attempt
[01:27:36] <djacobs> and the settings.py is added in the repo, so it should be able to find it
[01:27:47] <djacobs> it didn't move in perspective from the manage.py file
[01:28:09] <dodo> fwiw, WARNING: Running pip as the 'root' user can result in broken permissions and conflicting behaviour with the system package manager. It is recommended to use a virtual environment instead
[01:28:35] <djacobs> Yeah i didn't use a venv on the test-cycle!
[01:28:41] <dodo> so the core migrations are applied, looks like your apps aren't loaded. most likely settings

[04:07:34] <frozensoil> i'm completely new to python/django and am building a service that communicates with a third party api. I am wondering how to structure my class - currently, I am using requests and am sending calls to the endpoints directly but should I build a client class that has such functionalities or would that be overkill?
[04:07:56] <moldy> djacobs: yeah, don't add the venv in the repo, create it when running the CI job, but don't commit it
[04:08:08] <frozensoil> I added several `_do_this` functions in that service class
[04:08:42] <moldy> frozensoil: if there is no state that is shared between these functions, a class is overkill in some way, yes
[04:08:52] <frozensoil> but like from what I've seen elsewhere (and especially other frameworks), you'd instantiate a client and from that client you'd call x,y,z endpoints
[04:09:01] <moldy> you can still make one if you like, but it becomes a matter of taste

[04:09:54] <frozensoil> (it's intercom's api - the python wrapper is no longer maintained)
[04:10:10] <moldy> frozensoil: there is not much practical difference between MyClient().create_customer() and my_module.create_customer()

[04:13:14] <frozensoil> this is wrapped in a function which is called by other more specific functions (like create_customer(customer_data))
[04:13:21] <moldy> ah, ok
[04:13:39] <frozensoil> moldy: I'm completely new to python, how would I go about making it less verbose?
[04:13:56] <moldy> frozensoil: i assumed you call this in each place where you need it
[04:14:14] <moldy> if this is abstracted away behind wrapper functions, i think it's totally fine

[04:18:45] <frozensoil> moldy: I'm new to this company and am a bit overwhelmed, I feel like whatever I am writing is crap
[04:19:13] <frozensoil> but from what I've seen in the code and from examples, it's better to go simple and straight instead of overcomplicating stuff
[04:19:17] <moldy> personally i'd switch the order of the endpoint and payload arguments, but if you're always calling them as keyword arguments, that doesn't matter either

[09:26:21] <node1> Thank you.

[09:32:55] <FunkyBob> in most cases the -binary version is easier to use
[09:33:04] <FunkyBob> as it doesn't require you to have a compiler or development headers installed
[09:33:26] <FunkyBob> i would still recommend you look into upgrading django... at least to 2.3

[09:36:09] <FunkyBob> 2.2.1 release notes: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/releases/2.2.1/#bugfixes
[09:36:17] <FunkyBob> second item is a fix... so any newer 2.2 version should work
[09:39:31] <node1> Thanks it works
[09:40:05] <node1> I will work on the upgraded one but first let me work on the stable one.
[09:40:11] <node1> Get the ideas.
[09:40:40] <FunkyBob> which "one" are we saying?

[09:47:37] <FunkyBob> node1: is there a reason you're using such an old version of django?
[09:48:05] <node1> Yes to study the product life cycle. Simple.
[09:48:15] <node1> :)
[09:48:56] <node1> My main goal is to understand the product life cycle structure.

[18:30:21] <DanDare> Hi. Shapefiles (ESRI .shp) can be stored as tables in postgis. I'm playing with geoDjango and I want a interface where user can upload a shapefile to be imported to postgis
[18:31:06] <DanDare> Then use all geoDjango/django features. I cant find a good approach to this, because it must have a django model associated to that table
[18:31:19] <DanDare> Should I just find a way to create models on the fly?
[18:32:41] <DanDare> then not sure the best way to accomplish this. Start creating individual model files and migrating these runtime doesn't sound very sane
[18:34:20] <DanDare> also as each .shp can contain an arbitrary number fo columns and columns types
[18:35:27] <DanDare> Best I could find was https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44593541/django-how-to-migrate-dynamic-models-made-at-runtime
[18:35:41] *** mbrndtgn5 is now known as mbrndtgn
[18:36:05] <DanDare> But not sure.. may have a better approach to this. Clues?
[18:39:06] <DanDare> Perhaps having a separate management of these tables and creating 'in memory' only models on request, with 'managed = False'
[18:39:10] <DanDare> sounds feasible?
