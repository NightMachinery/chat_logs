[03:20:06] <juliaEnv> Given a website is open in your browser that uses WebSocket, what would be the easiest way to feed the websocket data into your locally running Kafka?
[03:20:56] <flakland> wtf is  a kafka
[03:21:05] <juliaEnv> conceptually, I can think of a proxy server through which the browser would connect. And the proxy server would feed the WS into local Kafka. (it would have to be somehow configured to only do it for the one specific website of interest).
[03:21:10] <juliaEnv> kafka is a message broker
[03:21:16] <PlanckWalk> A brain emultation of Franz Kafka
[03:21:43] <flakland> websockt is an upgraded http session
[03:21:51] <flakland> tcpdump would work
[03:21:52] <juliaEnv> if you know RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ, or other message brokers you should also know Kafka which is a distributed message broker optimized for writing (hence, the name)
[03:22:13] <juliaEnv> the websocket is secure (encrypted)
[03:22:22] <flakland> lol 
[03:22:35] <PlanckWalk> Inject some JS into the site's JS
[03:22:37] <flakland> so is https

[03:22:44] <flakland> whats your point
[03:22:46] <juliaEnv> would tcpdump work with wss, flakland?
[03:22:57] <jeaye> juliaEnv: If the socket is over TLS, the browser will need to accept the proxy's cert.
[03:23:16] <juliaEnv> I can add that cert into trusted and then the browser will have to accept it :)
[03:23:19] <jeaye> juliaEnv: You can look into how Charles allows you to debug TLS data, for example.
[03:23:45] <jeaye> Do you control the front-end app?
[03:23:46] <juliaEnv> Fiddler also allows that, however it's insecure because it runs for all sites I browse, then
[03:24:34] <juliaEnv> yes, I can open the app in my browser. I only can't change the app (unless I'd write some js using greasemonkey or FF addon)
[03:24:40] *** Quits: delvx (~arek@77.252.63.98) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[03:25:05] <PlanckWalk> Ah, if you can't change the app (or would prefer not) then a proxy is probably easier.
[03:25:08] <jeaye> I mean the app's source. The easiest way would be to have the app connect to Kafka directly.
[03:25:18] <jeaye> If you can't do that, the proxy will be saner.
[03:25:19] <PlanckWalk> But it really is the easiest way usually
[03:25:32] <juliaEnv> tcpdump or wireshark sounds good. Is it possible to stream the data into Kafka (message broker) in (near) real time instead of saving it to disk?
[03:25:49] <flakland> if not its possible to delete kafka and use something that works

[03:26:02] <jeaye> o.O

[03:27:37] <PlanckWalk> It all sounds a bit fragile.

[03:28:02] *** Quits: Klinda (~superleag@user/klinda) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[03:28:08] <juliaEnv> wireshark won't decode https, right?
[03:28:18] <jeaye> If wireshark can only write to a file, give it a special file which a service of yours owns which streams into kafka.

[05:28:18] <kveroneau> Borland Graphics Interface, something Borland had in the 80s for Pascal and C DOS developers to use graphics.  It came with various assembly routines and fonts packed into special object files which were loaded by the program on-demand.
[05:28:32] <TonyStone> so far our first "game" has been an etch a sketch game written with Free Pascal
[05:29:47] <Joanna> I don’t think we should be too concerned about the opinions of random people in irc that might not even be programmers:)
[05:30:15] <kveroneau> If you ever see a DOS program with .BGI and .CHR files alongside the .EXE, then it used Borland Graphics Interface.
[05:30:51] <TonyStone> yeah those file extensions do seem familiar to me!

[05:40:01] <smallville7123> flakland: GL_QUAD_STRIP: Similar to triangle strips, a quad strip uses adjacent edges to form the next quad. In the case of quads, the third and fourth vertices of one quad are used as the edge of the next quad. So vertices 0-3 are a quad, 2-5 are a quad, and so on. A vertex stream of n length will generate (n - 2) / 2 quads. As with triangle strips, the winding order of quads is changed for every oth

[05:46:26] <flakland> do you save on index buffer length or anything ??

[05:48:08] *** MrMobius_ is now known as MrMobius
[05:48:14] <PlanckWalk> You can programmatically convert a quad mesh to an equivalent triangle mesh, which is what an implementation will do internally.

[05:48:40] <flakland> not easily at least
[05:48:56] <PlanckWalk> Some triangle meshes hav no equivalent quad mesh
[05:49:50] <flakland> oh all the points must be co-planar?
[05:51:38] <PlanckWalk> Not always, but sometimes you just can't join neighbouring triangles into quads.
[05:52:00] <PlanckWalk> E.g. if there's an odd number of triangles, or their vertex properties are different, etc

[11:19:27] <PlanckWalk> No, it means that you now have to write the software so that it *conforms to* that spec.
[11:19:38] <Jck_true> True... 
[11:19:52] <PlanckWalk> And if it doesn't, then it's definitely a bug.

[17:43:13] <Quietwalker> I write code to run robotics in warehouses, sorters, pickers, etc.  Our biggest problem is the human factor, humans messing things up.  They'll cause accidents (purposefully or not?), they'll ignore process and cause issues, sometimes they'll even just do things like turn off pneumatic pushers so problem packages aren't diverted to inspection stations
[17:43:27] <Quietwalker> (inspection = time, they're graded on throughput, parcels per hour)
[17:44:27] <Quietwalker> so I said, "Let me have a remote presence robot, so I can drive around and look at what the problem is when there's an alert.  When someone with technical know-how is on site, they can usually diagnose the issue in 2-3 minutes, vs description from facility personnel which takes an hour to get to root cause"
[17:45:02] <Quietwalker> and they said, "Well, the warehouse has a lot of verticality, you can't drive a tablet on a segway up ladders and such to look at the overhead belts"

[17:46:26] <Quietwalker> and suddenly they're all "we're not trying to create a nightmare dystopia."
[17:46:34] <Quietwalker> Bezos would have said yes.
[17:46:39] <Quietwalker> *pouts*
[17:46:46] <piou> But wouldn't it be easier to have a mobile app that people can use to get you momentary eyes and ears upon request when an issue arise?
[17:47:09] <piou> Like, no flying drone but a man-moved remote-controlled phone?
[17:47:36] <piou> (too down to earth?)
[17:47:38] <deniska> Quietwalker: cleaning paint off = time and money, better deliver electric shock
[17:48:10] <Quietwalker> piou: we are doing trials of AR glasses that are integrated into teams meetings that allow a remote expert to "draw" or annotate on items in a 3D space.  So it's not just a moving overlay, it actually looks like you pointed at a button, and where you drew the arrow stays at that button even if the person wearing the glasses moves around a bit.
[17:48:13] <Quietwalker> but
[17:48:17] <deniska> you don't even need a drone for that, could be part of the personal equipment

And even if it is between 2x-3x minimum wage, that's still not a great rate for what you have to do.

[23:23:44] <sonny> yeah, good one
[23:24:40] <artifishul> What's the best way to automatically start background services when doing local work on one of my services? Just a bash script to start things in the background and start the primary service? I'm trying to make it so my team members only have one command to run to start a service locally instead of 8.
[23:25:45] <sonny> why not use your init system?
[23:26:01] <sonny> I'm going to guess it's systemd, which can do that stuff

[23:28:58] <InPhase> artifishul: If you're talking about developer test launches, a bash script sounds very reasonable, as long as you include shut-down in it.
[23:29:05] <sonny> I just realized scan_foo makes sense

[23:29:13] <InPhase> artifishul: start, stop, and restart are pretty basic features for this sort of thing.
[23:29:21] <artifishul> The workflow here is for a service that was just cloned, so I'm leaning towards a bash script.

[23:29:40] <artifishul> I was thinking of starting things with (command &) && ... but then things would be running infinitely in the background.
[23:30:07] <InPhase> artifishul: Just make 3 bash functions, where restart just calls stop, maybe sleeps for a brief moment, then start.
[23:30:51] <sonny> systemd timers :P
[23:32:01] <InPhase> artifishul: If you need to start storing the pids so you can terminate only the ones started by this process, and not start again if it's already started, then upgrade from a bash script to a python script to make your life easier.
