[00:27:19] <ramblebamble> autopsy, all fun aside, did fedora get a clean upgrade path by now? last time I used it there wasn't one and updating was always time for panick,
[00:28:48] <autopsy> Yes ramblebamble you can upgrade via Anaconda quite well now no worries and by Yum and DNF you can upgrade to new releases which is a newly refined feature and by manual rpm -Uvh packages.manifest you can upgrade yourself if you have to use rpm -Uvh --nodeps and --skipbroken then do it it will still work well.

[01:39:15] <Guest19802> Cron question for the smart ones here. I want to schedule for several days at the end of the month and the first few weeks of the beginning of the next month. Is there a way to tell cron to schedule across the month boundary (for instance going from dom:25-35) or do I have to have two schedule lines?
[01:39:18] <tsaka__> DLange: doesnt spport https external proxy
[01:39:39] <Guest19802> I found a lot of hits for "How to schedule a cron job for the *end* of every month
[01:39:54] <Guest19802> But not across a boundary
[01:39:59] <c705> Guest19802: i would just do two lines and move on to more important problems
[01:40:09] <Guest19802> I know the dow can do 0-7 do allow sunday thru sunday
[01:40:30] <Guest19802> Or rather dow thru sunday

[04:23:52] <Psi-Jack> AsenM: Well, how many potential streamers?
[04:24:33] <mlu> RAID10 optimizes for perfomrance here; RAID5/RAID6 might be more economical but you'll be spending time rebuilding the array if a disk fails
[04:24:49] <jochum> A big question for me whats its connection to the wild? 1Gbit/10/40/50 ?
[04:24:51] <AsenM> mlu, its a movie platform like netflix not actual live streams. People watch movies online.
[04:24:54] <mlu> so the big question is: can you afford the extra redundancy of RAID10?
[04:24:56] <Psi-Jack> Raid-6 is great, and even if you're "rebuilding the raid" you can still be using it.
[04:25:05] <blackgatonegro> So... no support for the Raspberry Pi 4 from RetroPie yet?
[04:25:26] <mlu> AsenM: ok -- so if you built two of those storage servers for redundancy and one of them dies, no big deal: you have a backup somewhere?
[04:25:41] <mlu> (i.e. it's just an inconvenience / downtime)
[04:25:42] <AsenM> I'm just starting out so i can
[04:25:43] <onelegend> I use RAID 1
[04:26:06] <mlu> AxenM: ah: so this is a storage server for a video stremaing service, and there's lots of content, right?
[04:26:09] <Psi-Jack> But, like Ceph too, they do redundancy amazingly. If you loose a drive, ceph will automatically re-allocate objects to make up for redundancy, and re-balance when you replace the drive.
[04:26:14] <AsenM> i cant* afford backup servers yet I have enough for just this one server I recently had storage failure with ceph and lost a lot of data
[04:26:17] <onelegend> Ceph is da best
[04:26:28] <jochum> And slowest
[04:26:33] <onelegend> naw
[04:26:42] <mlu> AsenM: the reason why I say this is that you have 24x14TB -- that gives you plenty of disks to do RAID10 and still have lots of storage
[04:26:45] <onelegend> lemme tell ya a lil somethin about speed
[04:26:54] <Psi-Jack> AsenM: Failure? With Ceph? but how? I've been running Ceph for 10+ years, without 1 byte lost, ever.
[04:27:05] <mlu> AsenM: that probably means you didn't configure Ceph to be redundant enough

[04:28:31] <mlu> AsenM: ah, ok -- that's the tradeoff -- if you have the videos backed up somewhere, maybe do RAID5 or Ceph with a certain redundancy factor

[05:37:31] <uwharrie> If hardware vendors were prevented from bundling an OS and end users had to go through the expense and trouble of purchasing, installing, and configuring one instead, then you could maybe have an argument that windows isn't easier, but the fact that people that don't care can skip that entire process means it's easier

[05:47:40] <AlexDelarge> ...yeah, thought so
[05:48:19] <knowmadic> roshen: I think you can make a case for it as a personal daily driver, but even then you are contending w/everyone using Windows in the Enterprise (by and large, far superior for manageability in large orgs), so I think as others have said, there isn't much of a reason to do it or learn something new if you just want memes and cats on the Facebook.
[05:48:38] <blackgatonegro> Kano OS  is your thing then?
[05:48:43] <AsenM> roshen, because it sucks for regular folks, it's harder, they never heard of  it, they simply don't care, if they have windows (that works) they have no reason to switch to a different one. Imagine you have forks at home you don't go out looking for different forks if yours are perfectly fine.
[05:49:19] <roshen> c705, why don't computer manufacturers like dell and gateway just ship with linux?  oh, right, because microsoft set up a big conspiracy to give the computer manufacturers windows for free, to force everyone to use windows, so that software developers won't develop software for linux, right?
[05:49:26] <c705> why should they?
[05:49:34] <knowmadic> Dell ships laptops with Linux, it's just not as attractive to the masses.
[05:49:47] <hi^-^> It is mostly that people don't know about Linux and *think* it is difficult to use.

[05:57:22] <AsenM> jochum, basically almost same concept as i3 (tiling), but more stable imo and easier to port from machine to machine.
[05:57:30] <knowmadic> I have a ton of use at work for Linux servers, and in many spaces it crushes Windows... but generally I don't see a lot of userland stuff.
[05:57:46] <roshen> knowmadic, idk, the only bad thing about linux is that software can be difficult to install, linux has a weird and difficult process for that, and i don't understand why, but it seems like linux software is generally far superior to windows software

[12:18:39] <jim> if you're thinking of ntfs for a partition type, just be aware that ntfs cannot cooperate all that well in situations where the linux system (and userland) needs for that filesystem to behave more like unix filesystems usually do (unix style owners, unix-style permissions)
[12:19:55] <jim> usually, partitions mounted in places like /usr, /, /var need that behavior, so maybe a better choice for those mount points, is ext4 (not the only choice)

[14:02:02] <hingoanashi1209> they said due to shortages and because so many people wanted them just for simple storage, a lot of the flashdrives manufactured recently are not intended to (not totally relevant) boot operating systems and would be very likely to fail.
[14:02:25] <akik> hingoanashi1209: that would be really strange
[14:02:37] <hingoanashi1209> This was because I had that problem with some new sandisk and kingstons -- for full install, not installation live media

[14:03:32] <akik> hingoanashi1209: that's such a huge change it's strange i haven't seen any news about it
[14:03:42] <hingoanashi1209> the live media would sometimes work but not the full install -- and yes dd'ing from a working iso
[14:04:06] <hingoanashi1209> it was in some cases sporadic, e.g. for sandisk

[15:00:12] <swarfega> you would need a new mobo
[15:00:18] <PaulFertser> I think it's about amd64 vs arm vs arm64 differenc.

[16:57:18] <Psi-Jack> I ran openSUSE as a desktop here recently for several months. I had issues left and right, one of which was an Intel WiFi module update which caused my Tabtop to stop being able to boot because of some regression bug.
[16:57:34] <Psi-Jack> Of course, that bug never hit openSUSE's OpenQA, and to it came to me, the user, to find it the hard way.
[16:58:15] <hexnewbie> You can also try and wait. (Almost certainly unrelated to this issue, but I had VMs hanging as they waited for their entropy pool to be filled, and they hung at approximately that spot, and you had to wait 3 minutes). Point is, sometimes information or e.g. a timeout error is printed *after* you've waited, not before.

[23:49:20] <ForeverNoob[m]> hi, between the Atheros QCA9880 and the Atheros AR9287, it's the AR9287 that has upstreamed (and thus open source) firmware, whereas QCA9880 has not, is that correct?
[23:49:22] <Psi-Jack> And yet, everything is random.
[23:49:35] <joo-_> yes, but everything cant be random if nothing is random and vice verca
