[22:55:55] <znf> my guess so far is that there's a concurrency issue -- some of the live streams aren't 24/7 -- they start only when a user zaps in on them, and I believe that when 2 users are attempting to start the same one at the same split second, they fail to write the .lock file before the *other* process is also launched
[22:56:07] <xD-> race conditions
