[01:48:14] <jonascj> moonshine thank you as well 
[01:48:27] <harryy> that is right, if you have @root(/), @home(/home) and @swap(/.swap) and set up snapper for / it only does @root
[01:49:04] <harryy> doesn't car if @home and @swap is mounted in subdirectories
[01:49:16] *** Joins: koolazer (~koo@user/koolazer)
[01:49:29] <jonascj> yes, and you agree I see that there will be a /.swap/file in the final system  -  @swap(./swap), great
[01:49:42] <harryy> that is correct
[01:50:07] <harryy> and of course, you need to mount @swap when creating the swap file
[01:50:16] *** Joins: silverwhitefish (~hidden@47.202.102.10)
[01:50:19] <h4rd3n3D> jonascj:  I've never used a swap file with btrfs.  I prefer a btrfs encrypted / with 2 logical volumes:  root and swap
[01:51:06] <moonshine> btrfs swap file support is relatively new, i think
[01:51:17] <h4rd3n3D> ^correct
[01:51:26] <jonascj> it came with kernel 5.0.x

[01:53:45] <jonascj> h4rd3n3D I saw suggestions for one partition for EFI and another partition (encrypted with LUKS) for holding btrfs (all subvolumes would hence be encrypted)
[01:53:54] *** Joins: Namarrgon (~Namarrgon@archlinux/op/Namarrgon)
[01:54:50] <jonascj> so that is what I'm trying to do. Some older suggestions have a third encrypted partition for swap, but since a swap file can now go in a subvolume it seems only two partitions are necessary (efi and cryptsystem)
[01:55:33] <harryy> jonascj: thats how i do it
[01:55:42] <harryy> works great
[01:56:29] <h4rd3n3D> jonascj:  right, when / is encrypted, irrespective of filesystem, everything under / is encrypted.  EFI must *never* be encrypted.  /boot can also be encrypted, but that is another issue

[01:57:46] <harryy> does grub support luks2 now? does it make sense to encrypt /boot?
[01:58:00] <h4rd3n3D> harryy:  yes and yes
[01:58:18] <Namarrgon> does it support argon2 yet?
[01:58:24] <h4rd3n3D> no
[01:58:30] <harryy> as for btrfs it makes sense to have /boot in the @root subvolume, so you can roll back on snapshots easier

[02:01:51] <Namarrgon> sure but a simple "yes" doesn't convey all these details
[02:03:29] <h4rd3n3D> PBKDF:      pbkdf2 - and afaik, grub argon2 support is being worked on.  So, I should have qualified my first 'yes'

[02:14:47] <jonascj> harryy but mount the subvolume with 'compress=lzo' still? 
[02:15:29] <jonascj> I suppose it does not matter since it only houses one file with compression turned off (per your 'btrfs property set', as the wiki also says you must, it just also says a 'non-compressed subvolume').
[02:15:53] <h4rd3n3D> johnnyapol:  grub could begin unlocking /boot on a LUKS1 / (before initramfs kicks in) for quite some time.  However, beginning with grub 2.06, grub can unlock /boot on a LUKS2 /, albeit with pbkdf2, not with argon2 (yet).

[04:36:57] <MeCrumbly429> well, for anyone who doesn't have any context and doesn't know about my incurable stupidity, I'm attempting live driver surgery on the arch live medium. I don't have access to ethernet (long story), but I used to, and what I did with it was install an arch/deepin desktop system that throttles almost instantly (my PC is a potato). I'm trying to add broadcom drivers to the live ISO by way of
[04:36:59] <MeCrumbly429> surgery, but to load broadcom-wl, I need to blacklist ssb, and ssb has the dependencies: mmc_core, and pcmcia. These sound important, and pacstrap might fail. Should I be worried about these kernel modules?
[04:37:30] <b-rex> you need pulse code modulation central intelligence agency
[04:37:40] <eschwartz> blacklisting one module won't affect its dependencies, which can still be loaded as much as they want
[04:37:50] <ParsnipChicken> beelzebuzz: I guess i'm looking for something minimalistic and stable
[04:38:00] <eschwartz> but also, the archiso is supposed to have broadcom-wl on it..

[10:01:25] <grawity> why do you need nftables.service at all, then?
[10:02:18] <john_rambo> grawity: Isnt nftables the real thing and firewalld just a "helper" ewhich helps in easy configuration of nftables ?
[10:02:43] <grawity> yes, but nftables.service isn't nftables
[10:03:10] <john_rambo> grawity: This is quite complicated
[10:03:13] <grawity> both nftables and iptables are kernel-level filters – they do not actually have daemons or services that need to be running
[10:03:25] <grawity> what nftables.service does is just load the rules from nftables.conf into the kernel and that's it

[10:03:41] <sheep> it does that with nft, which is the userspace frontend to nftables
[10:03:48] *** Joins: erica (~erica@user/erica)
[10:03:57] <grawity> so if you don't use nftables.conf, then you don't need nftables.service – you'll still have "nftables the real thing" without it

[10:05:37] <grawity> this is also why nftables.service only pretends that it's "active" (and was changed last week to stop pretending so)
[10:06:10] <john_rambo> grawity: sheep Since I read "One graphical front-end that supports both, nftables and iptables, is firewalld." I installed firewalld instead of nft
[10:06:30] <grawity> okay
[10:07:09] <john_rambo> grawity: I ran a nmap scan from the same PC and all ports are closed ....Is that enough information to make sure I am properly protected ?
[10:07:42] *** Joins: upsala (~zcb@185.213.155.160)
[10:07:53] <grawity> no, not really
[10:08:12] <sheep> a port being closed does not mean that a firewall blocked it
[10:08:20] <sheep> it could just mean that no process is listening on that port
[10:08:58] <john_rambo> sheep How do I make sure nftables is actually blocking all the ports ?
[10:09:18] <sheep> you probably don't want to do that for localhost or some local services might not work
[10:10:03] <sheep> basically, check that none of the services that you don't want to expose to the outside world can be reached from a different system
[10:10:15] <john_rambo> sheep while running the nmap scan I didn't use 127.0.0.1 .....I used 192.168.225.22
[10:10:30] <sheep> but that's still coming from the same source system as the target
[10:11:49] *** Joins: schweby (~schweby@user/schweby)
[10:11:52] <grawity> although it's not "the localhost address", *all* addresses belonging to the same machine internally go through the 'lo' interface
[10:12:00] <grawity> they don't go out through ethernet and back
[10:12:05] <john_rambo> sheep I have only 1 desktop at home so is there a way to check if there is are any ports exposed to the outside world ?
[10:12:23] <sheep> use a phone or something
[10:12:29] <john_rambo> sheep I I use grc.com that will scan my router not my arch box
[10:12:49] <grawity> tbh
[10:13:02] <grawity> "if there are any ports exposed" is kind of the wrong thing to worry about

[10:13:07] <grawity> ports do nothing on their own, *services* do
[10:13:48] <grawity> if your localhost nmap scan actually didn't find any services listening on any of the usual ports, then there literally is nothing for an external test to find, either

[10:15:52] <john_rambo> grawity: Yes that's what I thought too but this theory that even if all ports are closed,,, no listening services it still doesn't prove  that nftables is blocking them is my concern
[10:15:59] <grawity> [damn `ss` needs to borrow some libsmartcols from util-linux]
[10:16:10] <grawity> john_rambo: well, only two options for that
[10:16:16] <grawity> john_rambo: a) read the ruleset very carefully
[10:16:35] <grawity> john_rambo: b) make a program that'd listen on all ports, then nmap yourself from *another host*

[13:02:45] <raster> i'd leave "how the kernel works" towards the end.
[13:03:02] <randomxusr> seriously?
[13:03:04] <fltrz> thx
[13:03:05] <raster> tbh - study about how operating systems work in general. how virtual memory works etc.
[13:03:35] <earnestly> randomxusr: See `/topic #bash' for relevant links and avoid using google for resources
[13:03:44] <raster> learn bash first. best way to learn - solve problems. write small bash scriptlets (like 3-10 lines) to automate something you need
[13:03:49] <randomxusr> fair. What about regex search patterns, loops, functions, etc? leave those for now as well?
[13:04:33] <raster> to do that - read a bunch of example scripts that may do similar things as well as the bash manual page or better - just google for bash scripting and how that works - eg functions, logic (if/then/else, while, variables, etc.)
[13:05:02] <earnestly> Don't google for bash scripting, use #bash topic links
[13:05:12] <raster> leave regex for now. more advanced. you should learn globs though. used often enough in real-life bashing :)

[13:06:45] <raster> but the key is - solve real problems you have. it provides the pull/impetus to keep you going.
[13:06:59] <randomxusr> that's how I'm going about it.
[13:07:28] <raster> over the decades i've collected maybe ~50-100 or so scripts in me $HOME/s directory to just do everyday things i need to do and save me a lot of typing or remembering of the nitty details.
[13:07:54] <randomxusr> I'm using Linux Journey and the Arch Wiki mostly and then Applying some common sense from windows troubleshooting which has been help in that I can apply some logic to the errors or problems I have
[13:07:57] <raster> hmm ok more than i thought. 238 scripts :)
[13:08:37] <raster> sometimes they are as simple as
[13:08:53] <raster> https://termbin.com/hlo0
[13:08:58] <randomxusr> did I miss something, or was there an output for the topic on bash?  
[13:09:18] <raster> saves me rememebring all the dd options for what i want (that script i called catimg-sync)
[13:09:31] <randomxusr> raster: that's a great point
[13:09:37] <earnestly> randomxusr: It would appear in your client's server buffer
[13:09:54] <raster> nlot much in the way of shell logic there... but a time+brain saver.
[13:10:00] <earnestly> randomxusr: Also you'd be much better off, generally, asking bash questions in #bash
[13:10:05] <raster> then i have my rsync wrapper
[13:10:20] <randomxusr> I'm trying to document everything I'm able to successfully resolve for reference and anything that fails or I don't yet understand
[13:10:37] <raster> https://termbin.com/irdpy
[13:11:31] <raster> so now it begins to use some if's, loops, parsing some files that list dirs to exclude from the sync as well as the list of dirs that i want synced to begin with etc. - sure. it could be better, but it works for me and has done so for over 20y now :)
[13:11:56] <earnestly> So long as you don't have spaces in file names
[13:12:09] <randomxusr> Sweet, thanks for the link
[13:13:09] <randomxusr> I should get going to sleep. Thanks all for the help and friendly chat
[13:13:32] <raster> my point is - as you solve your problems and automate things you will use more advanced shell script features and eventually build more complex scripts. i have much larger more complex shell script affairs to eg build a custom raspberry pi arch arm image which does chroots/qemu launches of commands, builds a disk image as a file, mounts parts of that file with loopback for partitions etc. and that uses functions and a 
[13:13:32] <raster> lot more complexity. - so in the end you get there.
[13:14:12] <raster> earnestly: i dont do files with spaces :) (well certainly not for my list of base directories to include/exclude). i know how much of a pain they are. :)

[13:35:42] <raster> so each system may have a different sync exclude set on the target and this filter seems to make that harder as i'd have to generate this filter on the fly too like i do from a master list

[18:57:33] <kek_> hi, so I'm trying to get new bluetooth headphones working. I switched to pipewire and installe d bluez-git (because apparently there might be a bug in bluez). Anyway I got my instant disconnect problem solved and now I can head sound but not with the A2DP profile. Apparently, bluez-git should have helped here but it doesn't really do anything. What else could I do to figure out what might be wrong? :)

Just -Syu like normal and you will only ever get clean updates (or 404 file not found errors which are harmless if annoying; just wait a day or two and they'll go away).

[23:49:24] <jtritz> so should i basically add 'exec openbox-session' to the end of my ~/.xinitrc
[23:50:41] <jtritz> it's been so long since i did this, but i guess i should first remove exec startfluxbox from the xinitrc, then manually try to start openbox?
[23:50:45] <jtritz> after rebooting?

[23:51:04] <jtritz> or can i experiment with it from within my fluxbox instance, trough a shell?

[23:56:15] <Justice> meh I await 5.14 hopefully it will be solved there. Feels like amdgpu is a swiss cheese atm.
[23:56:23] <jtritz> well, i don't see any .openbox directory in my home directory after installing it... so i presume that's a difference between fluxbox and openbox

[23:57:53] <jtritz> of course, an attempt to run openbox produces: 'Openbox-Message: A window manager is already running on screen 0'
[23:57:56] <jtritz> this rings a bell
[23:58:16] <MrElendig> jtritz: most things will follow the xdg basedir spec these days
[23:58:23] <jtritz> screen 0 is what i have at the lower run level of just a cmd line?
