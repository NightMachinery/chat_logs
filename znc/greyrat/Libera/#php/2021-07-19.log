[01:57:28] <Linkandzelda> hello, how would I go about making a small templating language to build HTML while also making the compiler fast and efficient?
[01:58:41] <stenno> why do you want to make a templating language and not use an existing one?
[01:58:57] <stenno> if you have to ask the question like that, you probably should use an existing one..
[02:01:14] <Linkandzelda> stenno: there may or may not be one out there which i'd like, but i have an idea for one which sounds quite appealing to me
[02:01:46] <Linkandzelda> while i could design the language, im not sure the most efficient way to parse it into something usable
[02:02:35] <entuland> you could start describing which features you plan on adding, maybe someone knows of some system that already does what you want
[02:03:22] <entuland> can't tell if the hardest part is coming up with innovative / clever features of the templating language itself, or making it efficient to be compiled
[02:04:23] <entuland> the biggest performance gain is in caching anyways
[02:05:13] <entuland> which is independent of how fast / clever the templating system is
[02:07:04] <entuland> probably the most interesting approach in such systems is partial caching, so that some parts of a page can still be dynamic where other parts are cached and not recomputed all the time - but in many cases full page caching is just good enough
[02:08:00] <Blondie101010> that's even more true with dynamic pages

[02:34:33] <Blondie101010> hmmmmmmm, not sure how that could be of any use
[02:35:27] <Blondie101010> the point of a template is not to save on typing to get an HTML page
[02:36:11] <Blondie101010> a template is meant to define the core structure of the page and allow parts to be generated
[02:36:41] <Linkandzelda> it would be able to do that too, or yea it would be kind of useless other than "fast html"
[02:37:20] <Blondie101010> as mentioned, you should not consider doing a template engine, but rather look at the ultra popular solutions that already exist and do a good job
[02:38:16] *** Quits: Northwoods (~Northwood@223.130.30.165) (Ping timeout: 255 seconds)
[02:38:47] <Blondie101010> the only case I would perhaps agree with you is if you had been using 2-3 popular template systems in the past decade and found a flaw in them that you have clear plans on solving
[02:39:30] <__adrian> >Linkandzelda: i'd like to write something like this...  // heh. that's not a templating engine.
[02:40:02] <Blondie101010> I'd term that some kind of shorthand
[02:40:10] <__adrian> and there's also little value to it. if you want a templating engine, then write _templates_. the work to do is in organizing them and in how you provide values.
[02:40:17] <__adrian> yes, it's a shorthand
[02:40:53] <Blondie101010> it only matters if you need to type pages as people request them :P
[02:40:57] <Linkandzelda> i wrote a few of my own already, but they were just to solve the problems i faced. First one I called Partials, the latest one is called Blocks which is a block builder. they were arguably template engines in the way i used them
[02:41:07] <__adrian> use (e.g.) markdown for something like that
[02:41:41] <entuland> I am positive I've seen something out there using that shorthand notation
[02:42:07] <Blondie101010> but it doesn't really matter as it doesn't make writing HTML easier
[02:42:11] <__adrian> ^
[02:42:27] <__adrian> reduces typing but there's more thinking involved
[02:42:29] <Linkandzelda> I wanted a system which I could represent the entire template in code, and append any element to any element, then render the final result
[02:42:39] <stenno> thats haml

[02:43:27] <Linkandzelda> stenno: yea, that's good! thanks
[02:43:37] <Blondie101010> actually not the same but very close
[02:43:43] <stenno> yeah good enough
[02:43:46] <stenno> well
[02:43:52] <__adrian> interesting. kinda neat
[02:43:52] <stenno> % is a shorthand for div i think
[02:44:12] <stenno> nope
[02:44:27] <stenno> %element is short for <element ...>
[02:44:56] <Blondie101010> still can't find that useful
[02:45:03] <stenno> has been about 15 years since i last used that
[02:45:06] <entuland> you probably get a div omitting the element declaration altogether there
[02:45:15] <stenno> entuland: yes
[02:45:23] <Linkandzelda> wouldnt the end goal to actually be not writing any html at all to make it truly templatable/reusable?
[02:45:25] <stenno> #foo is <div id=foo>
[02:45:43] <__adrian> "truely" ?
[02:45:47] <Blondie101010> Linkandzelda:  not replace HTML by HAML...  that's still writing it from scratch
[02:46:00] <stenno> Blondie101010: see /about for rationale
[02:46:13] <Blondie101010> you seem to want a CMS or site generator
[02:46:21] <entuland> Linkandzelda, it really depends on how much different pages you need - you use a templating system when you have lots of pages with the same structure and different content
[02:46:41] <entuland> at that point, the template itself (HTML or whatever) that you have to write, is pretty much a one-shot thing
[02:46:50] <entuland> and most of the actual "creation" is in the contents
[02:47:07] * Blondie101010 nods
[02:48:48] <Linkandzelda> that's pretty much it. the bigger picture is nav/sidebar/content etc. but breaking it down there's smaller bits of each page like page header, breadcrumbs. then even further there's lists, custom lists, cards, widgets. all stuff which shares a structure and can benefit from identifying the changable parts (like icon, colour, text, sub-text, border colour, etc)
[02:49:22] <entuland> some CMS / CMF have plugins / modules that let you use client side editors (say, ckeditor and the alike) or markdown or whatever else if you want more or less control over certain parts
[02:49:29] <__adrian> colors, etc. don't belong in templates
[02:49:40] <__adrian> structure belongs in templates
[02:49:57] <Linkandzelda> __adrian: what about being able to set the class which controls the colours?
[02:49:59] <entuland> aye, you want such stuff in the CSS
[02:50:15] <__adrian> that's structure. unless your class is "blue" in which case your class is wrong
[02:50:29] <Linkandzelda> all that stuff is in css
[02:50:35] <stenno> your class name*
[02:51:07] <entuland> yes, using a "blue" class name pretty much defeats the purpose of separating the styling and putting it into the CSS
[02:51:16] <Linkandzelda> i guess what I made then was a CMS which used templates under the hood
[02:51:26] <__adrian> presuming the purpose of the class is to make something blue, then it's the class that is wrong, regardless of what you name it
[02:53:17] <stenno> oh talking about templates, not about CSS in general
[02:53:43] <stenno> making something blue is more part of a 'theme' oder identity, yeah

[02:56:47] <entuland> the jargon there may vary - for instance, they're called "themes" in Drupal and Wordpress but they're mainly a bunch of templates to decide how to lay the page structure down (along with a lot of the coloring / css / whatnot they come with)
[02:56:57] <stenno> oof
[02:57:19] <Blondie101010> well a theme is a bit more than template, but it does use or generate one
[02:57:48] <stenno> for me a 'theme' is purely styling
[02:58:02] <Blondie101010> the concept of theme allows for more
[02:58:17] <Blondie101010> I'm thinking of your examples

[03:06:16] <Linkandzelda> __adrian: do you think shorthand is worse even if the short forms are clear?
[03:07:33] <__adrian> if {something} helps, then that's cool. the thing about this is you're taking on a lot of extra work and commiting to maintenance for a (possibly? likely?) minimal benefit.
[03:07:54] <__adrian> this is exacerbated by the fact that somehitng very similar already exists.
[03:08:57] <__adrian> also consider that you need to _learn_ shorthand (and in this case, define it), when html is already well known.
[03:08:58] <Linkandzelda> __adrian: indeed, i think given that the other one exists there's no real point to commiting to it
[03:09:11] <__adrian> less of an immediate problem if you're the primary/only consumer
[03:09:19] <__adrian> but it'll eventually bite you as well
[03:10:40] <Linkandzelda> though on the other hand if it was just mine and i planned to write html for the next 30 years then spending a week to be able to write it quicker doesnt sound that bad
[03:11:17] <Blondie101010> hmmm...  I think everyone here agrees that writing pure HTML daily is a PITA
[03:11:36] <Blondie101010> that is not how you maintain a website
[03:11:54] <Linkandzelda> indeed its not

[12:11:21] <celphi> anyone else here use phpcs? Is there a way to disable the comment requirements?
[12:15:58] <AllenJB> What exactly do you mean by "comment requirements"? You can enable or disable rules on an individual basis (and more) using a custom ruleset config file - see the example config at https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer/wiki/Annotated-Ruleset
[12:17:04] <celphi> AllenJB: i commented them out https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/RMOSyiRB/image.png
[12:17:14] <celphi> but it's still requiring it
[12:21:12] <AllenJB> That block is commented out, so it will be ignored. Are you sure it's those rules that are being triggered (look at the "source" in the report file when using CSV or checkstyle report formats)

[12:34:30] <TinoDidriksen> celphi, what are the defaults for those options? Commenting them out just means the default is used.

[18:27:36] <entuland> okay
[18:27:39] <celphi> just add `|overthere`
[18:28:38] <entuland> there may be a performance difference but it's likely negligible, but yes, that regex is functionally equivalent to an array lookup if the array contains the various cases

[18:36:32] <entuland> check the code above
[18:36:57] <entuland> the first pattern contains the start / end markers, and it is failing to match a string that contains other stuff
[18:37:37] <celphi> that's because it's just preg_match (non-greedy)

[18:43:06] <celphi> you still havent shown me an in_array example
[18:43:27] <entuland> oh that was just to show that your one-word case was equivalent to the in_array search
[18:43:28] <entuland> like this
[18:43:30] <entuland> https://3v4l.org/FH6En

[18:44:41] <celphi> you dont have to check > 0
[18:44:52] <entuland> that's not important
[18:45:25] <entuland> the point was just to explain how the one-word check with ^ and $ was functionally equivalent to an array lookup
[18:49:35] <celphi> entuland: https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/w3cGpKJl/image.png
[18:49:50] <celphi> Is this what you're trying to do???
[18:50:33] <entuland> no, that wouldn't work if the string contained other stuff, of course
[18:50:36] <entuland> it's just like your red box
[18:50:47] <entuland> one works just if the string only contains all of what you're looking for
[18:51:09] <entuland> and if the string contains only what you're looking for, you can use the regex with start/end markers, or an array lookup, they would be equivalent
[18:51:14] <celphi> your example is a hack, it's not even using in_array like it's suppposed to
[18:51:42] <entuland> if on the other hand there is more, you can't use the array lookup and you can't use the start / end markers unless you alter the regex allowing for the extra data
[18:51:48] <entuland> I don't get the hack comment
[18:51:54] <celphi> the point of in_array is to find sometihng IN an ARRAY

[18:53:47] <entuland> we're mixing things up a little - there are two cases, the one that the original question asked, which is the case that cannot be solved with start / end markers and cannot be solved with an array lookup
[18:53:55] <celphi> which is what preg_match exactly does
[18:53:57] <__adrian> celphi: you then said "you dont have to check > 0"  which is not true, that's the proper thing to check
[18:54:21] <celphi> he said return false if none is found
[18:54:32] <celphi> which means > 0 is not required
[18:54:46] <entuland> and there is the case where we're looking for an exact full match, with can be achieved with the regex and start / end markers or with an array lookup
[18:54:52] <__adrian> false means there was an error.  0 means no matches.
[18:55:37] <stenno> ^ why you should always use ===
[18:55:41] <celphi> preg_match() returns 1 if the pattern matches given subject, 0 if it does not, or false if an error occurred.

[19:06:28] <dimi1947> as a I understand there are did ways to go about it
[19:06:33] <__adrian> dimi1947: yep. but those are the reasonable choices. don't do long polling.
[19:07:14] <dimi1947> __adrian:websockets or server-sent-events?
[19:07:23] <__adrian> yes
[19:07:24] <celphi> dimi1947: in a nutshell if you use long-polling your browser is pinging your server for an update on every x interval., whereas server side events broadcast to the broswer when the update happens
[19:07:34] <dimi1947> I see
[19:07:49] <stenno> longpolling is even worse, it keeps up a connection for a long time
[19:08:00] <stenno> (as opposed to shortpolling)
[19:08:09] <celphi> i wasnt aware that it required http2
[19:08:14] <dimi1947> but the result is the same I assume...real time notification
[19:08:23] <celphi> sse is even faster
[19:08:30] <dimi1947> cause that is what I am after here
[19:08:32] <celphi> bc you get notificaiton right when it happens
[19:08:50] <__adrian> "dimi1947> but the result is the same I assume...real time notification"  no
[19:08:51] <dimi1947> bc?
[19:09:10] <celphi> the polling could have just missed the update and now has to wait for the x interval
[19:09:15] <__adrian> (a) polling is not "real time," for starters. it's "every {x time}."
[19:09:27] <celphi> ^
[19:09:32] <dimi1947> ineresting little detail
[19:09:34] <__adrian> (b) one approach has the potential to crash your servers much sooner than the other

[19:18:01] <dimi1947> one last question
[19:18:47] <dimi1947> I assume that long polling would not be a problem...if the people/browsers making the request are very few...less than 10000 for exampl
[19:19:35] <__adrian> you need hardware+bandwidth that can handle that many requets _for every user_ you might have at the same time
[19:20:12] <__adrian> e.g., if you have 100 people looking at your site, that turns 10k into 1m
[19:20:18] <__adrian> it _does not scale_.
[19:20:31] <__adrian> it's _not_ the solution to pursue.

[20:16:04] <__adrian> newtoliberachat: that doesn't look like a real error message :) but i'd guess you have a typehint somewhere that's wrong. e.g., maybe you have `SimpleXmlElement` in a namespaced file.
[20:16:22] <stenno> SimpleXMLElemnt
[20:16:26] <stenno> typo
[20:17:00] <__adrian> think of namespaces like filesystem paths. unqualified, you might think you're in a different directory than you really are.
[20:17:17] <__adrian> try aliasing the classnames you use in namespaced files.
[20:17:19] <newtoliberachat> I typed out the error msg it is my typo
[20:17:34] <__adrian> e.g.,  <?php namespace foo; use SimpleXmlElement;

[20:24:21] <newtoliberachat> I found out there is only one namespace with SimpleXmlElement
[20:24:52] <__adrian> ?
[20:24:58] <__adrian> i don't think you're following
[20:25:18] <Byteflux> SimpleXmlElement is in the root namespace
[20:25:34] <__adrian> if you do  <?php  namespace foo; new SimpleXmlElement();  // this means  foo\SimpleXmlElement
[20:25:53] <__adrian> if you do  <?php  namespace foo; use SimpleXmlElement; new SimpleXmlElement();  // this means  \SimpleXmlElement

[20:26:41] <__adrian> alias classnames in namespaced files.
[20:27:32] <Byteflux> \ClassName is the fully qualified name for ClassName in the root namespace. \foo\bar\ClassName is the fully qualified name for ClassName in the \foo\bar namespace. When you declare 'namespace foo;' in your PHP file it is a lot like doing 'cd foo' in a filesystem, to explain it simply.
[20:28:27] <__adrian> pls note that, although we're using filesystems as an analogy, it's not _actually_ much like filesystems beyond the concept.
[20:29:14] <newtoliberachat> thank you for the explanation, i will debug further
[20:29:42] <Byteflux> right, it's possible for namespaces and filesystem paths to be completely different, it's just to explain how changing namespaces is similar to changing folders
[20:29:51] <Byteflux> it changes the relativeness of classes
[20:31:24] <__adrian> Byteflux: it's a valid analogy. not complaining, just cautioning, many people latch on and just run with assumptions ime.

[23:10:36] <W8TVI> So I am sanitizing the my $_GET with filter_input, and using the FILTER_SANITIZE_NUMBER_INT to make sure I only get numbers back.  I've read the docs on several different websites about the filter, but I can't figure out if there is a way to tell if the filter filtered anything out of $_GET.
[23:12:48] <W8TVI> Should I have it compare $_GET to my sanitized output variable?
[23:13:53] <AllenJB> Use the validate filter if you want to validate what the value currently contains. Sanitization and validation are separate operations.
[23:18:07] <W8TVI> I want to be able to tell if there was anything other than numbers $_GET that filter_input removed.  I'd like to be give the user a specific error message if there was something other than numbers in $_GET, if that makes any sense.
[23:18:45] <__adrian> W8TVI: use FILTER_VALIDATE_INT. this gives you the int if it's valid, and false if it's not.
[23:19:00] <__adrian> i.e., if it's false, you show an error to the user like "only numbers"
[23:20:27] <W8TVI> Ok, makes sense.
[23:21:08] <__adrian> there are some cases where FILTER_SANITIZE_* would be appropriate but by and large, you want FILTER_VALIDATE_*
[23:22:09] <W8TVI> Yeah, I want it to error if there is anything that I don't expect to be there, and if there is, stop and display an error.
[23:24:23] <W8TVI> I tried giving it one of the numbers it expected to receive, followed by ";) some command", and it just striped out everything but the number.
[23:28:19] <Sammitch> "sanitize" means "remove stuff I'm not expecting" and is usually "accept and corrupt bad data further"
[23:28:29] <W8TVI> :)
[23:28:36] <Sammitch> "validate" means "reject data that does not meet expectations"

[23:36:01] <streamfan> My code is here.  https://pastebin.com/C0hzup65
[23:37:51] <streamfan> Is there a setting that will allow file_get_contents to pass along the $_POST?
[23:38:14] <__adrian> streamfan: that seems unlikely, but either way, is probably a question for your provider. on your end, you can var_dump($_POST), and make sure your error repoting is correctly configured
[23:38:18] <__adrian> !+error reporting
[23:38:18] <php-bot> Set `error_reporting = -1` in your php.ini (to see errors on your webpage, also set `display_errors = 1`) and be sure to restart your webserver/fastcgi-listeners. Using `ini_set()` and `error_reporting()` is less reliable - for example, in the case of parse errors. See https://php.net/errorfunc.configuration or "/msg php-bot error logging" for more.
[23:38:57] <__adrian> oh, you mean you're _making_ a request and it's not sending the body?
[23:38:59] <streamfan> Provider is siteground, they will not answer any php questions, lol
[23:39:09] <__adrian> find a different provider
[23:39:14] <__adrian> (no lol)
[23:39:34] <__adrian> error reporting will still be necessary for you to troubleshoot
[23:40:00] <streamfan> _adrian, lol...I make the request and test $_POST before and in the called url the $_POST is empty, had been working literally for years until they changed the version on me
[23:40:26] <__adrian> i understand, but none of that helps you troubleshoot
[23:40:47] <__adrian> also very stongly recommend against file_get_contents for http requests. use a http client (like guzzle)
[23:41:26] <__adrian> (and there _is_ a setting that stops file_get_contents (et.all) from making http requests)
[23:42:14] <streamfan> it makes the call to the url but does not pass the $_POST. A client wont help as I am calling this from code..

[23:47:57] <__adrian> not much else to offer - you need error reporting, you need a host that will talk to you (or at least provide access).
[23:48:20] <__adrian> you need to be able to troubleshoot
[23:48:34] <__adrian> what version did you upgrade _from_?
[23:48:40] <streamfan> @--adrian....ty, I have access and am turning on error reporting
[23:48:41] <Byteflux> And a client like Guzzle isn't going to use the same mechanisms are file_get_contents() so I wouldn't assume it won't work.
[23:48:48] <Byteflux> s/are/as/
[23:48:58] <__adrian> ^
[23:49:38] <__adrian> that was more of a side recommendation, but might provide clues, or just work with your provider where file_get_contents() doesn't
[23:51:21] <__adrian> if you set up error reporting properly (see factoid above) and there are no errors, i'd suggest pointing at a service like httpbin to inspect what's actually sent
