[17:52:11] <pajamian> I followed that.
[17:52:24] <pajamian> I'm currently enabling adminlog to see if it tells me anything.
[17:52:43] <Khaytsus> znc debug then perhaps
[17:52:50] <Khaytsus> Admin log may have something
[17:53:18] <pajamian> It says this, which may be helpful...
[17:53:32] <pajamian> [2022-02-09 14:22:54] [pj] failed to login from ...
[17:53:54] <pajamian> because the username is pajamian
[17:54:05] <pajamian> so that means hexchat is trying to use pj?
[17:54:21] <Khaytsus> I think that's up to you to look and see?
[17:54:39] <pajamian> Yeah, I have it set to use pajamian as primary.
[17:55:01] <Khaytsus> um.
[17:55:02] <pajamian> what I'm asking is does the [pj] there mean that hexchat is trying to connect as pj?
[17:55:09] <Khaytsus> Look at hexchat.
[17:55:37] <Khaytsus> Your 'Nick" means nothing in hexchat for znc.
[17:55:46] <pajamian> or wait, it doesn't send the nick command until after the server password, though, does it?
[17:56:08] <Khaytsus> review that page and your config again.
[17:56:29] <knolle> username isn't nick
[17:56:34] * pajamian nods

[18:50:25] <zakalwe> hey. I've got a server that connects but I can't join any channels on it, I was in one on it earlier and it's saved in the web-ui and active etc, but it doesn't join on connect and I can't manually /join it or any channels
[18:50:26] <zakalwe> 'sup?

[18:55:49] <Khaytsus> zakalwe: So your znc is in the channels you expect it to be, but you can't connect to znc from a client and those channels work?  Never heard of that before.
[18:57:55] <zakalwe> hmm, well it doesn't seem to be connected on the web-ui, it's not showing a nick in the server list, and according to hexchat I am connected - but it says 0 clients
[18:58:02] <zakalwe> my other servers all say 1 client

[19:08:12] <Khaytsus> You sure you aren't directly connected to the irc network?

[19:09:05] <Khaytsus> I actually don't know of a way to see if a network is connected or not from the webui, I was thinking it showed but it doesn't.  You'd have to look by connecting into it and querying *status
[19:09:58] <Khaytsus> like /query *status listallusernetworks

[19:13:38] <Khaytsus> Oh I missed that, yes..  could be connecting to a network other than expected
[19:13:57] <MetaNova> each network in ZNC requires a separate connection in hexchat, meaning you need to open the Network List (ctrl+s) and create a separate Network for each zncuser/networkname
[19:14:09] <MetaNova> this is the first thing I recommend you verify is configured properly
[19:14:25] <zakalwe> I've got it setup the same as my other servers. if I remove the :password, it asks me to auth on connect with /PASS etc, which I can do, and it auths me, but then I still can't join any channels
[19:14:52] <MetaNova> hm.
[19:14:59] <zakalwe> if I take the password off and put server /PASS connection and put the password like (like my other servers), it says invalid password on connect.
[19:15:11] <zakalwe> very bizzare
[19:15:17] <MetaNova> zakalwe: /msg *status listallusernetworks
[19:15:59] <MetaNova> this output should display the connected user count as well as indicate if a given network is connected or not
[19:15:59] <zakalwe> https://i.imgur.com/kaCaKsI.png
[19:16:25] <MetaNova> well, that seems right
[19:16:42] <MetaNova> three networks, two of them connected, and each of those two has one connected client
[19:16:50] <zakalwe> is the bouncer actually on the network?
[19:17:02] <MetaNova> yes
[19:17:11] <MetaNova> ZNC is connected to gamesurge and liberachat
[19:17:14] <zakalwe> right, so the problem is logging into this instance
[19:17:27] <zakalwe> I mean is MyAnon connected
[19:17:33] <MetaNova> no
[19:17:35] <MetaNova> it is not
[19:17:35] <zakalwe> I'll just see if I can ping myself
[19:17:37] <zakalwe> oh ok
[19:17:58] <MetaNova> please see [[Hexchat]] and create a separate Network List entry for MyAnon
[19:17:59] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/Hexchat
[19:18:08] <zakalwe> so the problem lies in the webui on the connection settings for the server itself and not my way of connecting on the client
[19:18:22] <MetaNova> we don't know why MyAnon is not connected
[19:18:27] <zakalwe> I have separate entries for every server
[19:18:38] <MetaNova> but currently you don't even have a client attached to that user/network
[19:19:04] <MetaNova> you should attach hexchat to that user/network and then view what the output of *status indicates
[19:19:18] <MetaNova> we can also then reference /msg *status listservers
[19:19:32] <MetaNova> and try to determine why MyAnon is not connecting
[19:19:57] <zakalwe> https://atomicrhino.net/upload/ZeroBin/?a15857a35fba89e7#j80KRSKo3JjptJWr8qAkKqxs2YY1UI7SQpUqzRB+oRE=
[19:20:01] <zakalwe> that's my config file for hexchat
[19:20:30] <MetaNova> that seems fine
[19:20:46] <zakalwe> but it tells me invalid password on connect for nona
[19:21:08] <MetaNova> if you did not obfuscate your passwords
[19:21:16] <MetaNova> you'll notice they are not all the same
[19:21:38] <MetaNova> you should confirm that hexchat has stored your actual, proper password
[19:21:52] <zakalwe> I tried reopening hexchat, it's connected with no pw error, but can't join any channels
[19:22:07] <MetaNova> if you are speaking of MyAnon
[19:22:14] <MetaNova> not joining any channels is expected
[19:22:22] <zakalwe> https://i.imgur.com/T2V4Umi.png
[19:22:40] <MetaNova> ok cool
[19:22:50] <zakalwe> I did remove the password
[19:22:52] <MetaNova> zakalwe: please show what '/msg *status listservers' shows

[19:24:06] <MetaNova> well, there you go. invalid port.
[19:24:11] <MetaNova> easy fix
[19:24:14] <Khaytsus> Yeah I was going to say, ssl on 6667??
[19:24:16] <zakalwe> oh
[19:24:17] <MetaNova> zakalwe: please do the following:
[19:24:20] <zakalwe> that was my fault.
[19:24:28] <MetaNova> /msg *status delserver irc.myanonamouse.net
[19:24:30] <MetaNova> then:
[19:24:36] <MetaNova> /msg *status addserver irc.myanonamouse.net +6697
[19:24:39] <MetaNova> then:
[19:24:44] <MetaNova> /msg *status connect
[19:25:13] <zakalwe> I just changed it on the webui and reopened hexchat, it's running fine now
[19:25:18] <zakalwe> ugh. it's always something simple

[19:25:59] <zakalwe> anyone that still uses irc is a boss in my book
[19:26:15] <MetaNova> I am heavily involved in IRC :>
[19:26:26] <Khaytsus> I don't not IRC>
[19:26:31] <zakalwe> I like some features of discord, but I mostly hate it

[19:26:46] <MetaNova> I hate them

[19:26:58] <Khaytsus> I mean......  I'm not a fan of "having" to be on discord and irc, but it is what it is.
[19:26:59] <zakalwe> I've had an irc client on auto-run on my system for my entire life, sitting on the bottom left of the taskbar my whole life 24/7. I'll never not have irc
[19:27:04] *** Parts: lagash (lagash@lagash.shelltalk.net) ()
[19:27:23] <Khaytsus> I wish discord weren't dicks about their TOS and allowed third party clients
[19:27:29] <zakalwe> I don't have to be on irc, I just prefer it
[19:27:44] <zakalwe> yeah, it would be nice to be able to connect via irc to it
[19:27:53] <zakalwe> I can't stand how Fisher Price the UI is
[19:28:04] <zakalwe> you can 100% tell it's designed for, and by, the zoomer generation
[19:28:14] <Khaytsus> weechat has a discord plugin (third party) but people have, apparently, been banned for TOS violations using it
[19:28:32] <Khaytsus> um, no, discord was designed for gamers
[19:28:46] <zakalwe> yeah, the Twitch zoomer generation of gamers
[19:28:51] <Khaytsus> It's evolved to be less specialized, but originally it was VERY gamer oriented.
[19:28:57] <Khaytsus> zoomer??
[19:28:58] <Khaytsus> no
[19:29:07] <zakalwe> back in my day it was pickup games on irc and we were happy with that
[19:29:24] * Khaytsus is older than you are
[19:29:41] <zakalwe> I'm sorry :(
[19:30:34] <zakalwe> my favourite part of discord is being able to paste images from clipboard
[19:30:45] <zakalwe> infact that's probably the only thing I like about it
[19:30:49] <MetaNova> Khaytsus: I'm likely older than zakalwe as well
[19:30:51] <zakalwe> and being able to reference previous messages
[19:31:11] <zakalwe> I turned 34 in december
[19:31:24] <MetaNova> oh. you are older than I anticipated
[19:31:26] <MetaNova> I'm 36
[19:31:29] <zakalwe> having a bit of a third-life crisis
[19:31:48] <zakalwe> you're younger than I expected - I thought you were gonna say 50 something
[19:32:39] <Khaytsus> Heh, I've almost used irc as long as you've been breathing zakalwe ;)

[19:35:31] <DarthGandalf> I run a couple of IRC-discord bridges for people who don't want to use discord; but many discord guilds don't have such bridges
[19:36:34] <Khaytsus> I used weechat's thing once, it was okay..  you could have it autojoin all channels on a discord 'server' or join them manually; I opted for the latter.  It worked, I just didn't feel like dealing with being banned randomly so I don't use it. 
[19:36:43] <Khaytsus> Honestly dont use discord much, just keeping up with a few streamers

[19:37:55] <zakalwe> I used to idle in about 40 irc channels but over the years after I had to redo my client I forgot channels / stopped joining them, the only one I ever even talk in is just a small one with about 6 of us, used to be about 30, met playing Soldat back in the day and hung around and know eachother really well etc
[19:38:19] <Khaytsus> When they first moved to it, every channel had automatic voice chat and some other obvious "designed for gamers" things which they've made a lot more "generic" heh
[19:38:35] <zakalwe> I joke that we'll be in our 80's and just like 3 of us left in the channel
[19:38:58] <zakalwe> over the years people just disappeared or moved on for some reason. usually they got a girl heh.
[19:39:56] <zakalwe> but for me irc is just a passive thing that I always have running so as long as I'm using a PC I'll be using it, I guess some people see it as something extra they have to run 
[19:40:32] <Khaytsus> Yeah, most of my communities have grown, ebbed, and died
[19:41:02] <Khaytsus> Had an irc server in the mid 90s....  opennap in the early 2000's...  some of from opennap moved to irc...  all of those are all long gone now
