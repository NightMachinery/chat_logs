[00:22:37] <JordiGH> but what do you guys do nowadays for Python dev in Emacs?
[00:22:44] <JordiGH> Maybe elpy isn't the best idea anymore.

[00:26:03] <fsbot> edebug is [0] an awesome way to trace your errors. Read about it in the elisp manual, for which press C-x C-e after this: (info "(ELisp)Edebug") 
[00:26:03] <fsbot> [1] visit the lisp form you want to instrument (for example with M-x find-function), then press C-u C-M-x inside it ;;[ ,more / ,dump]
[00:26:15] <bremner> ,more
[00:26:15] <fsbot> [2] invoke the lisp form and step through it with SPC, jump to the next form with n, inspect state with e (by entering lisp code), continue execution with c and abort execution with q
[00:26:15] <fsbot> [3] finally, remove instrumentation with C-M-x inside the lisp form

[00:29:01] <bremner> hence the C-u

[04:23:22] <dragestil> Catie: ok.  I am having a bit of difficulty understanding how it generates a download script 
[04:23:38] <dragestil> Catie: do you use the download script for fetching news?
[04:24:14] <Catie> I use an RSS-to-NNTP bridge service, which aggregates RSS feeds and translates them to NNTP on demand
[04:24:40] <dragestil> The problem is that it generates the script by iterating over an undocumented var nnrss-server-data which is a random subset of the rss's I subscribed to in gnus
[04:24:40] <Catie> It is called Gwene, and I learned about it from our very own TRS-80
[04:25:01] * wgreenhouse seconds the gwene recommendation
[04:25:34] <Catie> dragestil: Yeah, I'm afraid this one's beyond me, I'm sorry

[04:27:35] <bpalmer> e1f: nothing wrong with feedly
[04:27:55] <dragestil> kjani: indeed i am tempted to switch to elfeed, if there's nothing else on [non]gnu elpa
[04:28:13] <Catie> That is to say, an RSS feed is meant to be publicly available, correct? Or is there a use for private RSS feeds that I'm unaware of
[04:28:32] <wgreenhouse> Catie: some podcasts have donor feeds behind http simple auth
[04:28:46] <kjani> dragestil: I just needed 2 lines in the config to setup elfeed because it does one thing and it does it well
[04:28:52] <Catie> wgreenhouse: I imagine Gwene would choke on one of those, right?
[04:29:08] <wgreenhouse> Catie: nah, it'd just not download the enclosure
[04:29:26] <wgreenhouse> you'd get the .mp3 or .ogg link in the body
[04:29:34] <kjani> I am thinking elfeed and emms would also act as a great alternative to youtube.com
[04:29:52] <wgreenhouse> there's also newsticker.el
[04:29:57] <dragestil> Catie: also what RSS feeds one reads is a personal thing.  It may not be easy to guess which of the public feeds I introduce to gwene, but still it feels a bit weird to add my personal rss feed collection there :p

[04:35:48] <kjani> Guys I am having a tough time setting up mu4e with gmail do you know of another email provider that is much more privacy respecting, easy to setup for mu4e and free at the same time ??
[04:35:48] <fsbot> Don't count on it
[04:35:54] <e1f> my mistakel they were 8 inch; "Oct 24, 2019 The Defense Department has transitioned away from a 1970s-era nuclear command and control system that relied on eight-inch floppy disks. The "modernizing" effort was quietly completed in June."
[04:36:07] <Catie> e1f: oh my god
[04:36:32] <Catie> kjani: Regarding privacy, my go-to recommendation is Protonmail; I don't know if it's easy to set up for mu4e, however
[04:36:53] <kjani> Catie: is it free I dont think so
[04:36:57] <kjani> lemme check
[04:36:59] <bpalmer> kjani: as always in these discussions, I suggest coming up with a meaningful definition for "privacy" that you want.
[04:37:00] <technomancy> kjani: the dependency on offlineimap/mbsync is the worst thing about mu4e by far
[04:37:14] <Catie> My understanding is that it's free to a point, you have to pay for additional storage or something
[04:37:19] <kjani> technomancy: truer words have never been said
[04:37:34] <technomancy> I don't think you'll ever find a setup involving those which is *good*, but you can find one that's better than gmail.
[04:38:05] <technomancy> I use dreamhost which is fine but doesn't really make sense if you don't also pay them for hosting
[04:38:21] <kjani> How many emails can I fill in 500 mb
[04:38:24] <kjani> any guesses
[04:38:29] <Catie> One
[04:38:34] <Catie> But like a really big one

[04:44:36] <technomancy> it's nearly half as much as gmail offered at launch in 2004
[04:44:44] <technomancy> of course, back then everyone thought it was a joke

[04:46:52] <technomancy> I mean people thought it couldn't possibly be true that they would offer an entire gigabyte as part of gmail. but also because they launched on April Fools' Day.

[04:50:48] <bpalmer> So if "privacy" involves "freedom from government authorized warrants" ... 
[04:52:06] <bpalmer> (but, again, this is why I am so skeptical of any conversation that talks about privacy without defining what is actually meant by it. See also the discussion in that link about captcha services and protonmail)

[04:53:39] <kjani> dragestil: what ?
[04:53:42] <bpalmer> kjani: tutanota requires use of its own mail clients.

[15:21:30] <pjb> You can have a look at Poplog which tries to do it.
[15:21:32] <thblt> WASM is pretty low level.
[15:22:15] <pjb> Using a language as VM is valid, as long as you have a good native compiler of this language, so you may implement others in it.
[15:22:34] <wkmanire> thblt: I mean, it's yet another byte code VM designed, in this case sandboxed and designed to be safe to run whatever may come over the waire.
[15:23:06] <wkmanire> I like the idea of it, but FFS, we have the python VM, the java VM, the .Net VM, the guile VM, it's just endless.
[15:23:21] <wkmanire> wire*
[15:23:34] <thblt> wkmanire: Well, you need to make a choice at some point.
[15:23:47] <thblt> Like with anything.
[15:24:05] <pjb> I know, we'll use a program to translate automatically from language to machine!
[15:24:10] <pjb> Let's call it a compiler.
[15:24:31] <thblt> That's not solving the bridging problem.
[15:24:39] <pjb> Just define the OS API, and let several languages target it.
[15:24:42] <wkmanire> I want the CPU manufacturers to align on this so we can get back to running binaries at binary speed.
[15:24:48] <wkmanire> pjb: Ex-fucking-actly.

[15:25:30] <wkmanire> Honestly, VMs are a symptom of the CPU industry. It really is if you think about it
[15:25:51] <wkmanire> A solution to the problem of, I don't want #ifndef's every 3 lines in my C++
[15:25:53] <bkhl> I like the llvm approach.
[15:26:42] <bkhl> I.e. a virtual machine that's also virtual in the sense it's not actually running during runtime, it's just an intermediate step to native compilation.
[15:27:18] <bkhl> I think they missed a trick not calling it a virtual vm though.
[15:27:32] <thblt> Virtualer Machine
[15:28:07] <aniketgm> to really understand what VM does check out what Hypervisors do internally. That;s your starting point.
[15:29:14] <wkmanire> aniketgm: Not sure I follow. This isn't about resource allocation, it's about interpolation of VM bytecode to native machine instructions for whatever CPU achitecture you're running.
[15:30:08] <thblt> This may be a confusion between two different meanings of VM.
[15:30:28] <aniketgm> oh. I misunderstood the conversation then.
[15:30:46] <aniketgm> then it's actually what JVMs do.

[15:31:27] <thblt> Yes, those VMs. Bytecode interpreters (or JIT compilers) with a fancy name.
[15:31:30] <pjb> wkmanire: no, it's more fundamental than that.  languages, CPUs and OSes, are the same: they're all virtual machines.  It's a general concept.  and you can build software by aggretating VMs in a single program. Each class define a VM, each object is an instance of a VM.
[15:31:53] <thblt> I'm pretty certain my CPU isn't virtual.
[15:32:06] <ecraven> anyone here using gforth.el? If I `run-forth' (on a nightly build), I get a repl *with* all the ansi color escapes. how do I disable them for the repl?
[15:32:22] <codingquark> Well well well, selfish neurons telling us stories
[15:32:37] <aniketgm> thblt: you sure. doesn't a hypervisor always runs underneath ?
[15:33:12] <thblt> aniketgm: I don't think so. It *may*, but it doesn't need to be present. 
[15:33:24] <wkmanire> aniketgm: So Python and .Net work a lot like Java. They compile to intermediate bytecode that is run by an interpreter. WASM was suggested as a base target for perhaps a homogenous emacs implementation based on some lisp, but the main idea is the same. In the case of WASM, the VM is literally your web browser.
[15:33:26] *** Joins: kogepan (~kogepan@user/kogepan)
[15:33:27] <pjb> wkmanire: once you recognize the generality of the concept, and understand that machines can be implemented using other machines, as interpreters or even with compiler, things become very fluid, and it doesn't really matter how things are implemented.  The only things that remains are the language (for ease of use, level of abstraction), and the implementation efficiency.
[15:33:28] <thblt> aniketgm: and that wouldn't make the CPU virtual in any useful sense.

[15:34:21] <pjb> Furthermore, nowdays, for most application we can accept to trade some efficiency overhead for the convenience of VMs.  Hence java/JVM or Android, etc.

[15:34:41] <pjb> wkmanire: it's the turtle all the way down under.
[15:34:44] <wkmanire> pjb: Well yes, that's the whole point of the VM. Write once run anywhere
[15:35:01] <pjb> wkmanire: only, there are so many VM to choose from, it doesn't work.
[15:35:16] <pjb> You need to rewrite for another set of VM branches.
[15:35:22] <wkmanire> pjb: I'm really referring back to the core of emacs. It's still in C, and as far as I know it's probably C'98 standard.
[15:35:26] <winning-luser> ecraven: im on emacs 27.2 and the forth repl doesnt display any color escapes
[15:35:28] <pjb> Or if you write a translator or interpreter, you lose efficiency.
[15:35:31] <ecraven> winning-luser: no, nightly, 0.7.9
[15:36:11] <wkmanire> I worry about the difficulty in attracting maintainers to keep the core of emacs fresh and up to date. I feel like if the whole editor were written in a lisp, that it would be easier to attract maintainers
[15:36:26] *** Joins: TikityTik (~TikityTik@162.223.44.49)
[15:36:28] <pjb> wkmanire: indeed.  It should be a simple matter to rewrite this core in CL. Until you realize that the problem is not the source code (which is finite), but the resources needed to maintain it, who are infinite, and the maintainers, who cannot be conviced to switch to CL.
[15:36:49] <pjb> wkmanire: so unless you have the resources to fork the core, you need to keep C and the existing maintainer team.
[15:37:17] <thblt> Read on Twitter: “forth is like violence: books glorify its elegance, but actually using it is, invariably, just blood, guts, and universal suffering”
[15:37:19] <bremner> the story of remacs is probably worth re-reading at this point
[15:37:28] <pjb> wkmanire: my solution is to write a C to CL compiler and just compile the emacs lisp code with it to have it run in CL images. 
[15:37:36] <codingquark> So you're convinced that the core should be written in CL and not in Rust, guile, scheme, sbcl etc etc? (I am just curious)
[15:37:46] <pjb> Yes.

[15:38:38] <codingquark> pjb: it seems to me that remacs folks are convinced about Rust and others on others and so on. No effort is reaching anywhere
[15:38:52] <codingquark> But everyone is convinced that the core has to be rewritten, at least
[15:39:09] <thblt> That's probably because the C core is large and extremely complex in a way that *isn't* a language issue. 
[15:39:22] <bremner> https://github.com/remacs/remacs/issues/1571
[15:39:23] <thblt> A Rust core would be, guess what, large and extremely complex, but in Rus.
[15:39:23] <aniketgm> pjb: now i'm a bit skeptical. Isn't EL / CL slower than C ? that defeats the whole purpose. performance should be a variable for consideration.
[15:39:24] <thblt> Rust.
[15:39:28] <codingquark> wkmanire: we are just talking about core. The extension language can remain elisp FWIW

[15:41:21] <codingquark> "What happened?"
[15:41:27] <pjb> thblt: of course, if a better lisp compiler than emacs lisp was available, more of emacs library  code could be written in lisp instead of C…
[15:41:30] <bkhl> When playing with Racket I've thought often that a language like that would be great for Emacs, where you can have modules in different language dialects.
[15:41:58] <pjb> wkmanire: CL is mutable and imperative.
[15:42:01] <bkhl> But I'm not sure if it would be possible to implement an Emacs lisp compatible language mode for Racket.
[15:42:03] <wkmanire> bkhl: or just modules...

[16:51:46] <rpav> that just does those things
[16:51:56] <bpalmer> rpav: copy-file ?
[16:52:14] <bpalmer> at any rate, you may end up liking f.el , although I wouldn't recommend it.
[16:52:25] <rpav> bpalmer: no like, open file, print/write output, and then it gets closed/written
[16:52:49] <rpav> f.el is like *filesystem*, which is cool, but i just want "open file, print strings, close"
[16:53:20] <bpalmer> (find-file "foo") (insert (foo)) (save-buffer)
[16:53:34] <rpav> this is more for elispy things
[16:53:52] <bpalmer> I think my point is that find-file and save-buffer are perfectly reasonable lisp functions by themselves.

[19:59:32] <icyflame> thblt: oh, all buffers huh. Yes, I don't fully understand the powerline <-> magit connection. So, understanding where I can hook into that would be the first step, I guess.

[20:00:09] <thblt> icyflame: magit has probably nothing to do with this.  The issue is that the mode line caches the branch info, and doesn't know how to update.
[20:00:42] <icyflame> thblt: Ah, I see. So you are saying that powerline is getting the branch name from the git executable, rather than through magit
[20:00:52] <festerdam> grym: Use some function and classes offered by a python module to crawl and parse some web pages.
[20:01:16] <bremner> you can write a python script and call that from emacs
[20:01:37] <grym> ^  entry_points is your friend 
[20:01:40] <grym> then just shell out 
[20:01:42] <icyflame> thblt: powerline <-> magit integration seems intuitive to me, as long as magit is being used.
[20:01:57] <thblt> icyflame: magit is an UI, not a library.
[20:03:19] <bremner> Is just me or are pathnames in common-lisp insanely over-engineered and mostly obsolete, in the classic autotools style?

[20:07:43] <icyflame> thblt: Thanks!!! "If you set auto-revert-check-vc-info to t, Auto Revert mode updates the version control status information every auto-revert-interval seconds, even if the work file itself is unchanged. The resulting CPU usage depends on the version control system, but is usually not excessive." auto-revert-mode and auto-revert-interval-seconds might be the two configurations required.

[20:10:28] <bpalmer> it's not likely a new version of common lisp will go through ANSI / ISO standardization -- as I understand it, it's expensive -- so most of the updates are going to be in the form of libraries and new standards.

[23:54:27] <mattf> I figured out my problem with buffers that dont close is because they are in multiple workspaces (doom-emacs user here)

[23:56:20] <minikN> mattf: Pretty sure there is a doom function to kill a buffer in all workspaces, but I don't have doom installed anymore
[23:56:26] <mattf> Sometimes i have buffers that are im multiple workspaces and they wont kill with (kill-this-buffer) or (kill-buffer name) and emacs will just switch to the previous buffer but it is still there. This happens with buffers that are in more than one workspace.  I can kill the completely using ibuffer though, it works from ibuffer. But what is ibuffer doing different? I wanted to have a keybinding to kill the current buffer from all
[23:56:26] <mattf> workspaces like ibuffer does.
[23:56:35] <mattf> minikN: I am looking for it

[23:58:24] <thblt> Sounds like reference-counting to me.
[23:58:39] <wasamasa> the more time passes, the more willing I am to just burn down all the starterkits
[23:58:41] <mattf> ok but there is a glitch, ibuffer kills it if I do it twice
