[00:54:27] <TJ-> darkstone: I've had large drives like that where after identifying the damaged area and telling the drive to map the sectors as bad, have continued to have long lives. It depends on first identifying the extent of the damage and its likely cause

[10:15:47] <bewees> hi, do people use hypervisors to ssh directly to other systems in the network or is it better to put everything in the guest hosts and work from there?
[10:16:25] <mlu> shouldn't make much of a difference
[10:16:39] <schillingklaus> i use neither ssh nor hypervisors
[10:16:57] <mlu> generally though, the big question is: why would you be on a hypervisor host?
