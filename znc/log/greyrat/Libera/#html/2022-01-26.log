[01:46:19] <relipse> How easy can this game be done with html: cworklog.com/showcase/eingame
[01:47:33] <stenno> i have no clue what that game is but i would think that it is impossible if you need any kind of dynamic interaction
[01:47:52] <stenno> if you also add javacscript and css, i'd say its quite easy if you know what you are doing

[05:42:32] <alystair> Ok I looked at the HTML spec for <link type="stylesheet"> and it seems that fetching and processing happens when toggling the disabled attribute... although it doesn't seem to be using the local cache... maybe it's an error in my local server setup (getting expected 304) that's preventing cache

[11:38:05] <Pilum> <!DOCTYPE html>
[11:38:16] <Pilum> It's the only one you need.
[11:41:21] <gry> when i validate for that, there is no 'valid html' badge offered by validator. searching on the web comes up with https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36383923/how-to-get-the-badge-when-validating-html-in-the-w3c-validator which is a bit vague, could you please tell me why is it not there?
[11:42:43] <Pilum> Because for some reason they still haven't created that for HTML5. I guess there's not much demand.
[11:43:51] <Pilum> https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https://youruri/ if you want to make your own.
[11:44:49] <Pilum> https://tdarb.org/html5-validator-badge/ seems to have a fair summary.
[12:05:22] <gry> thank you
