[00:01:55] <cuppajoeman> We may assume f^-1( (a, b) ) is non-empty or else the proof is done.

[00:02:30] <cuppajoeman> So we have some point p in f^-1( (a, b) ) such that f(p)  in (a, b)

[00:02:52] <Z-module> from being in that set
[00:02:55] <cuppajoeman> Yeah
[00:03:26] <cuppajoeman> We also know it's continuous there
[00:04:07] <cuppajoeman> I'm entirely sure what x should be in my image, but we would then have delta such that the function is contained within the box I drew
[00:04:15] <cuppajoeman> s/image/drawing
[00:06:16] <cuppajoeman> So I showed there was a basis element inside of f^-1( (a, b) ) so there fore it't open?

[00:15:43] <tolarz> namely the union of, for every y∈ (a,b)): pick x ∈ f^-1(y), then pick eps = min{y-a, b-y}, then since f is cts. at x, there is d such that for all 0 < |x' - x| < d we have: |f(x')-f(x)|<eps. Concretely, |f(x')-y| < min{y-a,b-y}. In other words, for all such x' we know f(x') ∈ (a,b).

[05:27:49] <bildramer> dunno but that doesn't make sense dimensionally
[05:28:03] <Macuser> say an iridium sat is traveling 7.5 km/s
[05:28:10] <Macuser> and it is right above me, so it is 780 km
[05:28:28] <Macuser> atan(7.5/780) gives me the angular change in degrees per second
[05:28:51] <Macuser> *(180/pi)
[05:29:00] <Macuser> ~0.55 deg/sec
[05:31:56] <PlanckWalk> Yeah, you won't find a source for that.
[05:32:39] <PlanckWalk> Try it in kilometres per hour.
[05:32:51] <decker> would think more like asin - opposite/hypoteneus... but the distance could be considered adjacent
[05:33:15] <Macuser> well yeah when it's directly over head it's technically not "adjacent" anymore
[05:33:36] <Macuser> PlanckWalk why in hours? seconds is more useful
[05:33:38] <decker> and the result is iscolelese not right
[05:33:51] <PlanckWalk> atan(27000/780) = undefined
[05:34:07] <PlanckWalk> Oops, was thinking tanh
[05:34:27] <Macuser> arc tan, inverse tan
[05:34:34] <PlanckWalk> Okay, 1.54 radians per hour.
[05:34:35] <decker> ... 2*atan(speed/dist/2)
[05:35:10] <PlanckWalk> Anyway, there's no atan in there and it makes no sense.
[05:35:39] <PlanckWalk> Just  7.5/780  radians per second.
[05:36:17] <decker> that's if you want the speed at like 1km or something
[05:36:17] <PlanckWalk> Convert to degrees per second by 180/pi if you like.
[05:36:35] <decker> which I guess arclen=angle at a 1
[05:37:38] <Macuser> ...
[05:37:44] <Macuser> the point is you can change the distances
[05:37:47] <Macuser> distance*
[05:37:52] <Macuser> so it's not directly overhead

[05:38:48] <cherim> There is never any arctangent in this problem, just as PlanckWalk says
[05:39:19] <cherim> You probably mix up finite angles (change of the angle after 1 sec time) and angular velocity
[05:40:09] *** Quits: slidercrank (~slidercra@user/slidercrank) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[05:40:48] <cherim> Even when not directly overhead, you just project velocity onto the normal to the radius-vector and divide by distance
[05:40:52] <PlanckWalk> The closest you get to arctan is that if a satellite was moving in a straight line passing overhead, you could use arctan to derive the angle.
[05:41:02] <cherim> There is sin or cos, but never an inverse trigonometry
[05:41:15] <PlanckWalk> But satellites don't move in straight lines, and you want the rate of change of the angle.
[05:41:59] <PlanckWalk> So even in that case you don't get an arctan

[05:58:39] <Macuser> understood decker
[05:58:47] <bildramer> speed/distance is (distance/time)/distance is 1/time, and you can't take arctan of 4 per second, that doesn't mean anything

[06:37:53] <lalami> Fangs: hello here is the definition of |= but I found 2 definitions in the book which confuses me too. Do they mean the same thing in 2 of these definitions? one is this: https://i.imgur.com/bYkNrWr.png and the other one is :https://i.imgur.com/KR7hq0g.png
[06:38:50] <Fangs> lalami: what's your background and what's this course for?
[06:39:07] <Fangs> normally you'd have a 'model' and a 'language'
[06:39:35] <Fangs> one talks about truth in terms of a model, the other in terms of proofs in a language
[06:40:30] <Fangs> an assignment of truth values to variables would be the model side of things, the other would be the proof sense of things
[06:41:14] <Fangs> usually a discussion on soundness followed shortly with a discussion on completeness
[06:42:22] <Fangs> I forgot which is which, but one's basically saying the statement that your proof system can prove is "true" is also "true" in the model (I think this is soundness)
[06:43:00] <Fangs> completeness would be the other direction. things that are true in your model has a proof that shows its true in the language (if im not mistaken)
[06:43:33] <cuppajoeman> lalami: in the first definition you have "something1 |= something2"
[06:43:43] <cuppajoeman> What is the first thing

[06:50:28] <cuppajoeman> Now the second has the same form but this time what's on left and right of |=
[06:53:28] <lalami> cuppajoeman: for second one , both sides are some formulas, and it is saying if the formula on the left side is true in some structure, then the formula on the right side is also true in this structure?
[06:53:58] <cuppajoeman> So you see how the second def is using the first
[06:55:39] <cuppajoeman> They're pretty much defining the |= in a new way
[06:56:02] <cuppajoeman> So it was diff meaning depening on whats on left and right of it
[06:56:22] <lalami> so |= is being used in different context?

[11:45:29] <lpapp> "Note: if the slope is �steep� (>1) then the end of the line segment will hit size / 2 units away from the middle on the y axis. If the slope is �shallow� (<1) the end of the line segment will hit size / 2 units away middle on the x axis.
[11:45:33] <lpapp> "
[11:45:58] <riv> lpapp: so if you understand what I've just explained, I checked that the x coordinate was within a range - this code is doing a different method, they are checking that the slope lies within a certain range in order to determine the same thing

[11:54:20] <lpapp> but I am curious to know the logic behind the slope == 1 comparison.
[11:54:30] <riv> when you have a line equation y = mx + c, slope 1 is a perfectly diagonal line
[11:54:37] <lpapp> yes
[11:54:40] <riv> slope > 1 is going up higher than a diagonal
[11:54:50] <lpapp> yes
[11:54:54] <decker> changes which edge to check
[11:55:16] <riv> so if a line is going through the center of a square, you can tell which edge it's going to hit based on if the slope is >1 or <1
[11:55:24] <riv> if the slope =1 then it will hit the corner
[11:55:41] <lpapp> oh, ok, so this is it then? 08:51 < lpapp> jmorris: is it trying to find the nearest edge based on the slope == 1 or what is going on
[11:56:05] <riv> in the slow =1 case there's no nearest edge, it goes through the corner
[11:56:12] <lpapp> sure
[11:56:50] <lpapp> that case is special, and probably do not need much computation other than midpoint.x + sign* size/2, midpoint.y + sign* size/2

[13:04:48] <damo22> because if you imagine a rubber band shrinking to a single point at every neighbourhood of any point, it should still be able to shrink to that point

[14:14:16] <Z-module> cadmio: not clear yet:  If r > 1, then an intermediate term in the numerator is  p^r - p     You have to do the reasoning from yesterday's link to see why, for every l, each fraction's numerator in there is dividible by p^l iff the denom. of that same fraction also is.
[14:15:07] <Z-module> greenbagels: I'm really not the person to ask, sorry.
[14:15:30] <greenbagels> Z-module: sure thing; thanks anyway :)
[14:15:35] <greenbagels> (also, good morning!)
[14:17:41] <Z-module> cadmio: sorry, I meant that if r > 1, then one of numerator fractions is   p^m - p^r + p     It's not immediate at all, just by looking, that the only p's you need to "get rid of" from the full expression are in the very first fraction  m p^r / p^r
[14:17:42] <cadmio> in the num. there are no terms divisible by p: m(p^rm−1)⋯(prm−p^r+1)
[14:18:15] <cadmio> the same thing in the denominator: (p^r−1)⋯1 so the whole bit is not divisible by p

[14:19:18] <Z-module> If r > 1, there are p^r > p fractions, and among those every pth one has factors of p in top and bottom. The pth fraction is   (mp^r - p)/(p^r - p)

[15:25:05] <Z-module> I might not have been totally clear, yeah.  oo is not in R^2, it's a new point. So the open sets of X = R^2 cup {oo} are:  each U \subset R^2  (just R^2, not all of X) that is already open in R^2, *and*  X\K   for each compact K \subset R^2.  X\K = (R^2 \ K) cup {oo}
[15:25:22] <damo22> wow so the complement of a circular area in R^2 is another circular area around {oo}

[15:28:49] <cloudcell> hehe
[15:28:52] <W> I had problems understanding open sets and how whether the boundary was included in the set or not mattered, but I think I got it now. A neighbourhood does not have to be any specific size, there's no minimum, so the boundary not being included means that for any point you can always find another point in a direction by e.g. taking the halfway point between the given point and the boundary in that direction (however impractical that is, the theoretic possibility is all that
[15:28:52] <W> matters). Does that sound halfway right?

[15:37:21] <damo22> W: neighbourhoods of a point are all the points surrounding another point. in one dimensional R you have an open neighbourhood defined by open intervals (a,b).  In R^2 the open neighbourhoods are discs centred at the point without the boundary points
[15:39:39] <W> damo22, yes but the reasoning is the same regardless? You can always find a "surrounding" point because there's always an interval in that direction (unless it's not an open set and the point is on the boundary) - there's just more directions in higher dimensions
[15:40:43] <damo22> i think so
[15:42:13] <damo22> you can probably say its defined by (x-e, x+e) in R and extend that to all the dimensions

[18:05:12] <Z-module> To be even more explicit about it:   (x - 2)^2 >= 0  is true for *all* x.   (x - 2)^2 <= 0  is only true for some x (just one value, in fact), which you can find out by knowing the first fact.
[18:06:14] <biberao> Z-module: yes i understand all that
[18:06:23] <biberao> i was confused that we had to do both
[18:06:36] <biberao> but since (x-2)^2>0 will always happen
[18:06:44] <biberao> and the condition is <=0
[18:07:18] <biberao> so that was my confusion if had to do both
[18:07:20] <Z-module> no, (x - 2)^2 > 0  will not always happen.  '>'  means *strictly* larger than.
[18:08:07] <biberao> well true
[18:08:19] <biberao> (2-2)^2>0 is false
[18:08:29] <biberao> :(
[18:08:58] <Z-module> for any two reals c, d, exactly one of  c < d,  c = d,  c > d   is correct.  So if c is your (x - 2)^2 and d is 0, you already know from properties of squares that either  c > d  or c = d.  Thus "c <= d"  can only be true if c = d.

[19:01:02] <greenbagels> cuppajoeman: it's common enough for people to abuse notation and just call this image f(U)
[19:01:24] <greenbagels> with the idea that f(<set>) = {f(x) : x in <set>}
[19:01:41] <greenbagels> same with preimage
[19:01:50] <greenbagels> that might make it cleaner to state, along with Z-module's advice
[19:02:14] <cuppajoeman> So if m is in Inv(f^-1, U), then f^-1(m) in U. Then f(f^-1(m)) is in the image of U, but f(f^-1(m)) = m
[19:02:45] <mawk> so did you like this fact Z-module ?
[19:03:01] <cuppajoeman> And if m = f(k) for some k in U, then f^-(m) = k so m is in inv(f^-1, U)
[19:03:12] <cuppajoeman> Ok, I see they're equal, kinda confusing though
[19:03:37] <mawk> it's using the generating function that I found it, x \sum x^n(1+x)^n I expanded the (1+x)^n
[19:03:52] <mawk> then factored according to the power of x
[19:04:03] <mawk> and it gave this sum of binomials
[19:06:17] <cuppajoeman> So pretty much if both f and f^-1 are cont. then we know that for any open set U of Y (f: X -> Y), then Inv(f^-1, U) is open wrt. X, but also Inf(f^-1, U) is equal to Im(f, U).

[19:24:35] <somiaj> Are you sure they said R and not R^2?
[19:24:49] <Franciman> S^1 is a subspace of R^2 usually
[19:25:07] <cuppajoeman> R^2 ***
[19:25:23] <somiaj> cuppajoeman: okay, so take open balls and intersect with the circle, and what sort of sets on the circle do you get (This is the basis)
[19:25:37] <riv> Franciman: did you solve the torus problem?
[19:25:44] <Franciman> riv: not yet
[19:25:47] <Franciman> I'll be doing it later
[19:25:47] <riv> ok!
[19:25:49] <somiaj> and do you see how you cannot get things like f(U) as shown in that picture
[19:25:58] <Franciman> I sure found one structure of the torus
[19:26:03] <Franciman> now I need to understand the other lol
[19:26:07] <cuppajoeman> So if you intersect balls with the circle ou get segments of the circle right
[19:26:15] <Franciman> my guess is, please don't make fun of me, the different torus structures depend
[19:26:18] <Franciman> on the radius of the torus
[19:26:27] <Franciman> if you get a fatter donut, it gives a different structure

[19:29:14] <somiaj> cuppajoeman: which line segment? the [0,1/4) one?
[19:29:14] <Z-module> It does turn out that subspace open subsets of the circle must be countable disjoint unions of "open arcs" along the circle, though remember that thentire circle itself is open too (not sure if you'd call that an arc0.
[19:29:38] <cuppajoeman> The curved segment on the circle
[19:29:51] <cuppajoeman> To show that's open, I have to show that there is a basis element inside of it right?
[19:29:54] <cuppajoeman> for every point in it
[19:30:04] <somiaj> cuppajoeman: No it isn't open, because of the '[' or that the set contains the endpoint p
[19:30:27] <cuppajoeman> So we can't find a basis element that covers that point and stays within the curved segment?
[19:30:42] <cuppajoeman> Is this the right definition of open I should be using?
[19:30:51] <somiaj> cuppajoeman: to show it is open you have to show that every element inside the set is an element of a basis element that is also a subset of U. In this case, you cannot find a basis element that contains p that is also inside f(U)
[19:30:59] <somiaj> cuppajoeman: that is one of many, but it works.
[19:31:01] <cuppajoeman> Right
[19:31:14] <cuppajoeman> Ok, I see why.
[19:31:15] <cuppajoeman> Thank you
[19:31:22] <somiaj> arg, that U should have been f(U)
[19:31:35] <cuppajoeman> Why was [0, 1/4) open wrt [0, 1) though
[19:31:51] <somiaj> cuppajoeman: because of the subspace topology from R
[19:32:01] <somiaj> [0,1/4) = (-1,1/4) int [0,1)
[19:32:11] <cuppajoeman> Ah right
[19:32:32] <cuppajoeman> So it's pretty much breaking because of the loop over
[19:34:14] <somiaj> Yea, this is showing that this map doesn't create an homemorphism between [0,1) and S^1. You should be able to generalize this to show that no map can be a homeomoprhism between these two spaces
[19:34:25] <somiaj> though the trick here is looking at what happens at 0

[22:13:30] <kobalt> I am confused. This question https://i.imgur.com/VeVYli5.png I know that S3 is true and S4 is false.
[22:13:47] <qergle> for 3x3, as an example, you can pick two lin indep vectors 1,2 and then pick vector 3 as multiple of vector 2
[22:13:52] <riv> if the determinant is zero then M does NOT have an inverse

[22:14:24] <qergle> then vec 1 is not lin combo of vec 2,3 but the three are lin dep as a group and if columns of 3x3 are singular
[22:14:41] <qergle> so you need to make sure you say the set is not linearly indep. not that each is a combo of the others
[22:15:08] <cherim> Only S3 is true there

[22:15:54] <cherim> And the source of the test looks incompetent
[22:16:30] <qergle> yes, the test-source seems to think (D) is right
[22:17:48] <qergle> that's unfortunate, lots of confused students.
[22:18:11] <kobalt> Is the question broken
[22:18:36] <qergle> none of (A),(B),(C),(D) are right, so broken, yes/
[22:19:36] <riv> > Determinants can be used to characterize linearly dependent vectors: {\displaystyle \det A}{\displaystyle \det A} is zero if and only if the column vectors (or, equivalently, the row vectors) of the matrix {\displaystyle A}A are linearly dependent
[22:20:07] <riv> so S1 and S2 are the same in this thing
[22:20:15] <riv> that rules everything out except (D)
[22:20:50] <cherim> Linear dependence does not mean *each* may be represented as a combination of others

[23:41:08] <decker> (that was on the wrong channel, but... )  https://www.desmos.com/calculator/vusxumrekj  like an object on a path - the rate of change of the angle is non constant...

[23:42:09] <cads> ppw, recall that your original definition was that f is at least twice differentiable when it is in f^k for all k greater than 1, which is really the definition that f is infinitely differentiable, aka smooth

[23:44:05] <ppw> that's precisely it.
[23:44:31] <cads> if something is twice differentiable, then it's in C^2, obvious

[23:51:34] <ppw> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_theorem
[23:55:42] <cads> ppw, can you show that C^k is contained in C^k' forall k' < k? Or at least are you familiar with that fact? Or conversely, can you see how C^0 contains C^k for all k, and how C^k contains C^k' forall k' > k?
[23:57:56] <cads> I feel like it comes from a really trivial induction on the definition of C^k. if something is C^k, that means that it's continous after k derivations. And from this we must conclude it was continuous at k-1 derivations as well.
