[02:32:44] <ABXmadness> Hi. I have a question regarding EAC3. I hear no difference while ABXing two encodes with same bitrate/channels using AC3 and EAC3 (I can only find a difference if I do phase cancelation to check it). Is ffmpeg's EAC3 a poor implementation or is EAC3 really no big improvement over AC3 at same birtare/channels?
[02:39:10] <ABXmadness> You don't need to keep social distance in a chat... someone could answer this if it feels like...
[02:40:24] <another|> it's been less than 7 min. have a bit more patience
[02:40:45] <ABXmadness> Sorry, I don't know how things go in this IRC.
[02:41:08] <ABXmadness> I'll wait, then. Thanks!
[02:41:22] <BtbN> It's also super specific. Good chance that plain nobody knows.
[02:42:09] <another|> Not sure what you're asking honestly. If you can't ABX them, what's the problem?
[02:42:44] <ABXmadness> Yep, I'm afraid that might be the case... but ffmpeg-devel isn't a place for this question either, right?
[02:43:27] <ABXmadness> The problem is... EAC3 should be a better encoder than AC3 at the same bitrate and keep more detail.
[02:43:52] <ABXmadness> If I can't ABX... well... there's no difference, and it is supposed to be.
[02:44:07] <kepstin> if you're running both at bitrates high enough to be transparent, then that's expected behaviour
[02:44:38] <ABXmadness> Not trasnparent at 256 or 384. Sibilance is quite present.
[02:44:51] <ABXmadness> (5.1 channels)
[02:44:57] <kepstin> also, which encoder are you using?
[02:45:10] <ABXmadness> ffmpeg ac3 and eac3
[02:45:42] <kepstin> ah. well, ffmpeg's encoders for those formats aren't particularly great, and there's not really much incentive to develop them
[02:46:20] <kepstin> ac3 encoder was useful to get 5.1 over a spdif connection, but since hdmi's taken over that use case is obsolete now
[02:47:22] <another|> Ah. I was inferring transparency. My bad
[02:47:22] <kepstin> you'd really want to compare using commercial encoders if anything
[02:48:10] *** Quits: Volgaar (~volgaar@104.66.13.93.rev.sfr.net) (Quit: WeeChat 3.2)
[02:48:20] <another|> Do you actually have a hard requiremnt for those codecs? Or can you maybe use something more modern?
[02:48:24] <ABXmadness> Well, I can understand that.. but EAC3 and AC3 are centric to most new Dolby audio technology. I think that is relevant enough... though maybe not for open source.
[02:48:42] <kepstin> for open source everyone just uses opus :)
[02:49:12] <kepstin> the ffmpeg decoders for ac3/eac3 should be alright, if you find a problem with them please report it
[02:49:13] <another|> ABXmadness: If you want to improve (e)ac3, patches are welcome
[02:49:17] <ABXmadness> I would like to use a good commercal encoder... but I don't have that kind of budget.
[02:50:09] <ABXmadness> I need ac3/eac3 for compatibility. I would prefer eac3 because it was supposed to be better.
[02:50:13] <kepstin> well, budget to buy an encoder, or budget to develop an open source encoder... we'd prefer the latter here, i suppose :)
[02:50:40] <ABXmadness> Yep. but opus is not something you'd find in any AVR

[02:51:22] <ABXmadness> @another If I had that kind of knowledge I wouldn't be asking this, I would be solving it ;-)
[02:53:22] <furq> kepstin: i was under the impression ffmpeg ac3 is pretty good
[02:53:36] <furq> at least aften was pretty well regarded before it got merged back in
[02:53:43] <ABXmadness> I would prefver whatever solves my problem, to be honest. But since I don't have the bufget to buy one, or the knowledge to write one... well... I ask, to at least understand.
[02:53:57] <furq> no idea about the dd+ stuff though
[02:54:03] <another|> Well, I guess nobody has had much interest in improving these encoders.
[02:54:06] <kepstin> well, the problem is that compared to other codecs it's just alright i guess
[02:54:17] <furq> are there any particularly great ac3 encoders
[02:54:20] <kepstin> other newer codecs i suppose
[02:54:53] *** Quits: APic (apic@apic.name) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[02:54:57] <kepstin> yeah, if i was making a dvd or something i'd be perfectly happy with ffmpeg's ac3, it's fine
[02:55:43] <another|> furq: dunno. maybe dolby?
[02:56:32] <ABXmadness> ffmpeg's ac3 is mostly fine at 384+... Dolby's EAC3 supposedly achieves same quality at 192-256.
[02:56:49] <ABXmadness> But... not with ffmpeg's eac3
[02:56:54] <furq> i've only ever used ffmpeg ac3 at 640 so i wouldn't know
[02:57:07] <furq> it wouldn't surprise me if the eac3 stuff is much the same as ac3

[02:58:16] <ABXmadness> There's almost no difference in ffmpeg's ac3 vs eac3... and that's why I came here to understand why :-)
[02:58:25] <ABXmadness> To my ears, at least.
[03:00:09] <ABXmadness> What I don't really understand is why there was interest in developing x265 but no one thought about the audio side. I suppose people prefer to use aac, opus... though compatibility with hardware is not stellar...
[03:00:25] <another|> As said: Because nobody wanted to work on it. If you want to; go ahead. Is increasing the bitrate an option for your usecase?
[03:00:46] <furq> well usually when you use x264 etc you just copy the audio
[03:00:58] <furq> or you're a professional house who can stump up for the commercial encoders
[03:01:26] <ABXmadness> Not really. Storage space is cheap but at the end it raches a point where it isn't.
[03:01:56] <ABXmadness> So I was aiming at ac3 384 and hoping for eac3 256
[03:02:22] <ABXmadness> But ffmpeg's eac3 falls short, I'm afraid.
[03:04:18] <ABXmadness> Heh. I want to work on it... but I'd need to learn a few years to even understand what I'm doing.
[03:04:34] <kepstin> but yeah, as I said, for the consumer AV case, AC3/EAC3 encoding is basically obsolete, since you can just stream high channel count pcm over hdmi
[03:04:59] <kepstin> so it doesn't actually matter what codec you use, if it can be decoded on the player
[03:06:33] <ABXmadness> Streaming two tracks in PCM 7.1 + 4K HDR10 would be interesting.
[03:06:45] <ABXmadness> Not to mention storing it.
[03:07:58] <minimal> ABXmadness: from reading Wikipedia article on EAC3 it seems to me the focus was on *increasing* the channels and maximum bitrate, rather than reducing bitrate compared to AC3
[03:10:38] <ABXmadness> To increase channels and improve quality. ANd you need bitrate for that, but also a more efficient encoder. That was EAC3.
[03:11:51] <kepstin> the encoder is basically just for storage. the streaming is fine, hdmi has lots of bandwidth and audio, even pcm, is pretty tiny compared to video.
[03:12:02] <kepstin> well, storage and online streaming i suppose

[03:15:42] <ABXmadness> But only if you do it from a decoding-capable hardware, ie, a PC
[03:16:22] <ABXmadness> If you have a NAS and leave to TV/AVR the decoding bit, you're screwed if codecs aren't there.
[03:16:46] <ABXmadness> And that's where ac3/eac3 comes in.
[03:16:58] <ABXmadness> Less space, most compatible.
[03:17:52] <kepstin> well, the easiest way to get an ac3/eac3 source is to just copy it from the original video, heh
[03:18:07] <kepstin> no reason to re-encode if your video source is a bluray for example
[03:20:43] <ABXmadness> Of course. But if you wan't to keep a cheap media server and you aren't rich, space costs money. So I need to recode... or go and rummage thru a bunch of BD that might or might not be readable.
[03:21:56] <ABXmadness> Anyway, in any case, what I wanted to know I think it's already been answered, ffmpeg eac3 is what it is and is no better than ac3. So... that's the end of it.
[03:22:10] <ABXmadness> Thanks everybody for helping!
[03:28:38] <kepstin> re-encode only the video, keep the audio

[11:15:27] <aphysically> oooooo there was a slice threading thing that landed
[11:15:50] <aphysically> I had a thing this morning where swscale was underperforming relative to what I remember but I didn't notice there was changes
[11:16:01] <JEEB> the AVFrame API also went in
[11:16:13] <aphysically> I'll have to retest before/after the change when I wake up
[11:16:48] <aphysically> I was downscaling 4k -> 1080p with swscale which I hadn't had problem with before but I wasn't able to reach realtime encoding

[11:23:04] <JEEB> I'm not sure if the new API should affect perf at all :P
[11:25:00] <aphysically> well, I noticed the slice threading thing takes the threads value to get passed along, I might be setting threads somewhere in my scriptlet dumbly and it didn't matter before the slice threading patch and now it matters? I'm not sure really, I'll find out tomorrow
[11:26:16] <aphysically> speaking of, I've almost completely moved to python now; I just finished the meat of the server-side code today
[11:26:41] <aphysically> after that's all working I should probably look into using the API directly instead of ffmpeg.c

[16:11:02] <Sindre> Hi. I'm trying to decode a RTP-stream of VP8 using a Rust-wrapper around libav*. It works as it should, but when I save the data back to a mp4-stream, it looks like this: https://i.imgur.com/Wzf15kO.png. When looking at moving video, it can look like the keyframes are missing. However I can see that the decoder waits for a keyframe and then starts
[16:11:02] <Sindre> to read the stream.
[16:13:31] <Sindre> Here is the code: https://pastebin.com/qYDYhJw5
[16:14:03] <Sindre> Can anyone see what I'm doing wrong?
