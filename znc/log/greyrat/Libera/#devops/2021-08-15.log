[19:25:51] <Lyn> Would you pick Jenkins or GitLab as a beginner?
[19:34:41] *** Joins: danisztls (~weechat@user/danisztls)
[19:36:37] <kubblai> probably gitlab Lyn but mainly coz most ppl hate jenkins not anything to do with being  a beginner
[19:42:10] *** Joins: fling (~fling@user/fling)
[19:50:13] <dodo> Lyn: if you need a ci tool, jenkins. gitlab does too many things
[20:02:52] <kwilczynski> If GitLab is managed, then getting simple CI job and/or a pipeline to work ranges from easy to moderately involved (depends what you want to do). Jenkins with pipeline plugins and such, can also be configured using Jenkinsfile (Groovy) these days, and you can do a lot of things, but I assume it would be self-hosted?

[20:03:54] <Lyn> yeah, trying to have everything hosted locally except for staging & production servers
[20:04:41] <Lyn> though it'd also be great if the setup was such that I could easily modify it to be a bit more proper to onboard another dev
[20:04:53] <dodo> the learning curve is probably steeper with jenkins, but it's more powerful
[20:05:24] <dodo> hm, what do you mean by onboard? get somebody else to work on the ci?
[20:05:36] <Lyn> to work on the code
[20:06:01] <dodo> i don't really think ci matters for that? just make sure the feedback gets to the devs
[20:06:11] <dodo> *which ci
[20:11:12] <kwilczynski> dodo: Might be, but... funny enough, it might be easier to get self-hosted Jenkins going than setting up self-hosted GitLab :)
[20:11:30] <kwilczynski> It's a very apple vs oranges hehe.
[20:11:38] <dodo> oh, absolutely
[20:12:01] <kwilczynski> Even with Omnibus installer, GitLab can be a pain to set up.
[20:12:05] <kwilczynski> Sadly.
[20:12:12] <kwilczynski> Thank you RoR.
[20:14:22] <kwilczynski> Lyn: Also, as per dodo, on-boarding someone might be more involved than just getting them access to CI/CD. I suppose.
[20:14:48] <kwilczynski> Local development environment would be something they should set up and it would have to be solid and functional.
[20:14:48] <kwilczynski> :)
[20:15:05] <kwilczynski> Most people, as per my experience at least, develops locally before pushing something to be run by CI...
[20:18:56] <Lyn> yeah, there are so many moving parts currently that it's a bit difficult to wrap my head around it all
[20:19:24] <Lyn> e.g. I'm also thinking of how to best host a git repo, perhaps gitlab in a docker container
[20:24:48] <dodo> best depends on which features you want

[23:36:53] <rawtaz> why does everyone default to thinking about gitlab
[23:37:37] <rawtaz> its like so many defaulting to ubuntu without having a single clue
[23:43:52] <kwilczynski> I don't have a clue :/
[23:44:21] <rawtaz> i think we can simply call/dub it The Mainstream Syndrome
[23:44:38] <kwilczynski> :<
[23:44:46] <rawtaz> and consider it a decease (assuming i spelled that correctly, i didnt mean someone dying :D)
[23:44:54] <kwilczynski> Not fair! My mom always told me that I am special!
[23:44:58] <kwilczynski> (I am just joking)
[23:45:03] <rawtaz> oh but you are :3
[23:45:08] * rawtaz pats kwilczynski
[23:45:08] <kwilczynski> I am?!
[23:45:16] * kwilczynski purrrs like a kitten
[23:45:21] <rawtaz> yeah just look at you, sitting here talking to me. noone else does that :-)
[23:45:31] <kwilczynski> No, it's not that.
[23:45:35] <kwilczynski> You fallen asleep.
[23:45:38] <kwilczynski> :)
[23:45:48] <rawtaz> ooh, that explains a lot of things
[23:45:54] <kwilczynski> :)
[23:50:35] <lantech19446> rawtaz: I won't default to gitlab cuz I don't even know what it does
[23:52:49] <rawtaz> thats good :))
[23:53:00] <lantech19446> I'm so confused about what exactly ci/cd is, it feels like everyone has a different definition
[23:53:17] <rawtaz> yeah that stuff can be daunting. dont worry about it. when you need it you will know
[23:53:20] <lantech19446> Sorry was just looking at gitlab hoping to expand my knowledge
[23:53:38] <rawtaz> if you want to get into it in a common way you can just start setting up some automated tests or similar in github actions
[23:54:00] <lantech19446> Tests?
[23:54:10] <rawtaz> yes your code
[23:54:23] <lantech19446> Oo ok that's why I was lost I have no code
[23:54:23] <rawtaz> could be as simple as automatically running a linter that checks the code and tells you how bad it is
[23:54:35] <lantech19446> Nor do I know the process behind coding correctly
[23:54:43] <rawtaz> sure, then you dont need much CI/CD unless you have other types of products that could use it
[23:55:06] <lantech19446> I just wanted some idea of what it is its popping up everywhere
[23:56:37] <rawtaz> in short it's about having source code that you feed through automation or pipes or whatever you want to call it where usually multiple types of checks/tests/processing/packaging is performed, in order to make sure that the product of the source code is working as intended, is ready for usage hot off the presses, is distributed properly, etc.
[23:56:57] <rawtaz> it's just a very general term/concept, it's not one or two specific things that you do.
[23:57:02] <rawtaz> general/broad*
[23:57:38] <lantech19446> Ok that still answers my question ty
[23:58:28] <rawtaz> often it's about shorteing the feedback times for developers so that they can write code, push it to the servers, get a result (bottom line, was the change they made good or bad), and then carry on working. instead of having to do a ton of stuff manually and error-pronely. but all this is just one use case for CI/CD and the related devops stuff
[23:59:47] <lantech19446> Still pretty cool. I've gotta get cracking on learning to code. I really want to get into DevOps and I don't know anything about dev
