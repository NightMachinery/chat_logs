[00:13:54] <ThePendulum> skye0_mobile: eh so how do you proof the pregnancy was unwanted at the time, or whether there is any guilt and who's responsible?

[00:14:21] <ThePendulum> it seems very easy to just start sueing each other when you both fucked up or when you change your mind
[00:15:11] <ThePendulum> the man could seek damages from the woman as well
[00:16:16] <skye0_mobile> if there are some people who are desperate to avoid abortion or in places where it's illegal, this may be the lesser evil? IDK

[00:20:56] <ThePendulum> if it was just for cases of rape where a conviction has taken place, sure, but if it applies to people having consensual sex... it sounds like a total mess
[00:22:52] <ThePendulum> raising a child costs a lot more than $10,000, if you're in need of that kind of money you might also be kind of desperate for it. if you're dealing with the chaos of an unwanted pregnancy adding a financial incentive to pit the parents against each other just seems like a stupid idea

[00:23:45] <ThePendulum> where do you even begin proving that if they were together by choice, there isn't anyone that wasn't supposed to be there
[00:25:38] <skye0_mobile> hmm. this is difficult. some people oppose abortions because they do believe life begins at conception and don't want to see a baby die. but then there are some who oppose it because they think women shouldn't sleep around or something
[00:25:45] <ThePendulum> and who is getting people pregnant on purpose? it seems to me if you get pregnant either you're both terribly unlucky, both terribly negligent, or the sex wasn't consensual
[00:26:04] <ThePendulum> okay, but surely you shouldn't be allowed to sue someone based on those beliefs
[00:26:13] <Hydragyrum> like if you're having consensual sex, you could easily have taken the pill first or the like
[00:26:22] <unfinity> ・゜゜・。。 ​ ・゜゜\_ó<​ QUAC​K!
[00:26:35] <Hydragyrum> ,bang
[00:26:35] <unfinity> Hydragyrum you shot a duck in 13.490 seconds! You have killed 1 duck in #datahoarder.
[00:26:57] <ThePendulum> I mean if there's any ambiguity at all it's probably not going to be in favor of women. it's difficult to claim he hid the fact he wasn't wearing a condom, a lot easier to say she hid the fact she wasn't taking the pill
[00:27:34] <skye0_mobile> ThePendulum bear in mind too there's a huge cultural and religious incentive against extramarital/premarital sex. also, too, there are men who refuse to use condoms *and* pull out
[00:28:26] <ThePendulum> if it's consensual you agreed to take the risks involved in that though
[00:29:29] <ThePendulum> if the education for that is lacking, it will be lacking for both parties involved and you still don't have an obvious victim
[00:30:15] <ThePendulum> don't you already have to pay child support?

[05:42:29] <evilgohan2> I honestly, at this point, would recommend just sticking to Windows 10.

[16:00:36] <skye0_mobile> KevinCarbonara I might have to get a Chromebook for all productivity-based stuff that isn't Windows. TBF Chromebooks have been more radical with how they look and function but since they're part Android now more productivity apps will work with it unlike on Linux I think
[16:08:37] <skye0_mobile> So I opened up a Tutanota email account, one thing I love about it already compared to like ProtonMail is how simple it is.
[16:09:02] <skye0_mobile> Only real gripe I'd have with Tutanota is that it's based in Germany, an EU member state, and the EU has been about as cancerous as America with copyright law.
[16:09:18] <skye0_mobile> Plus, without paying for Tutanota, I wouldn't be able to search all my emails for free
[16:09:46] <skye0_mobile> that's a 1.50 EUR paywalled feature
[16:09:50] <slothjaw> linux apps can be used on CB, also dual boot chrome OS with linux or full linux install after eol see "mrchromebox.tech", dell 7310 CB eol'd great full install linux laptop
[16:10:47] <skye0_mobile> yup slothjaw, that is true. There may be some apps that people need for productivity that work on android but not linux. so far there's no streamlined way of emulating android apps on linux
[16:11:14] <skye0_mobile> one thing i love about chromebooks is that they don't have a capslock key
[16:15:13] <slothjaw> yea big reason initially went for CB was android apps with chrome OS and linux all in one device, f in hate google tho, looking at seperate degoogled android device with seperate linux device now and f chrome OS (ill miss easy gdrive, gdocs gmail tho)
