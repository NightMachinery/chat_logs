[19:37:13] <Bayes> hmmm it's kinda hit or miss, happened a good couple times mostly with lists but I can't replicate rn top off my head
[19:37:22] <Bayes> I'll pay more attention until I find a specific example
[19:38:39] <Bayes> or maybe it's my highlighter that it's highlighting false positives
[19:43:57] <Demosthenex> Bayes: yeah, look into global-whitespace-mode and let it highlight tabs
[19:44:41] <Demosthenex> honestly, i want to use TABS for indendation and spaces for alignment everywhere, but i've had to revert to just spaces because of the inconsistency across modes. i never could get tabs working
[19:46:21] *** Quits: ec (~ec@gateway/tor-sasl/ec) (Quit: ec)
[19:46:53] <Bayes> http://ix.io/3THm this is my global-whitespace-mode
[19:47:36] <Bayes> to be fair Demosthenex, I don't remember why I decided for spaces over tabs, but I'm guessing I just wanted to pick something and stick with it
[19:48:05] <Bayes> I sometimes do some non-standard indenting in my code and text, so I think I picked spaces over tabs just cause they're more flexible
[19:48:18] <Demosthenex> sure. again, spaces align things to be visisble
[19:48:34] <Demosthenex> but if you want to say "indentation level 1" "indentation level 2" at start of line, that's what tabs were for
[19:48:43] <Bayes> ah gotcha
[19:48:48] <Bayes> see what you mean
[19:49:06] <Bayes> never thought about the difference between indentation and alignment
[19:49:24] <Demosthenex> yeah, for most programmers tabs vs spaces is a flamewar
[19:49:43] <pjb> No. it is not.  it's a paycheck question.
[19:49:47] <Demosthenex> the issue is tabs have "tab stops" or variable widths, but that was supposed to be tunable by the programmer.
[19:49:49] <pjb> Programmers using spaces earn more.
[19:49:53] <Demosthenex> pjb: no, and you showed me that before.
[19:50:00] <Demosthenex> pjb: correllation != causation
[19:50:06] <Bayes> xD
[19:50:10] <Demosthenex> Bayes: see what i mean?

[19:50:18] <Demosthenex> pjb: correllation != causation
[19:50:26] <Bayes> Demosthenex look, my opinion is more important than yours
[19:50:27] <Bayes> xD
[19:50:44] <Bayes> and I'm .99 sure pjb is just kidding around
[19:50:48] <Demosthenex> he is
[19:50:54] <Demosthenex> he's on tons of channels with me ;]
[19:51:01] <Demosthenex> i don't take it seriously
[19:51:03] <pjb> The stats are serious.
[19:51:10] <Demosthenex> fact is, we need both kinds. indents and alignment.
[19:51:29] <Demosthenex> the problem is, tastes vary. some programmers like large gaps for indentation, some like small gaps.
[19:51:34] <Bayes> I take it with peanut jelly butter
[19:51:36] <Demosthenex> 2 spaces vs 8 spaces, that kind of thing.
[19:51:52] <Bayes> I think some languages figured that out, things like blacken and such
[19:51:54] <Demosthenex> i'd like to have tabs to indent, and my tab stops set to 2 or 4 spaces wide, and then spaces to align.
[19:51:56] <Bayes> we have no such luck in R AFAIK
[19:52:02] <Demosthenex> but again, major mode support for that varies
[19:52:16] <Demosthenex> smart-tabs mode only supports algol langs (ie: java, C, etc)
[19:52:36] <Demosthenex> so i've given up and use spaces to indent, even though that's a hack
[19:54:21] <Bayes> I guess at this point in life I've given in to settle with hacks more often that I'd like to
[19:54:50] <Demosthenex> tell me about it

[21:45:30] <Demosthenex> james-stoup: well, worg is community written. you could ask for write permission
[21:45:40] <Demosthenex> james-stoup: is the tutorial hosted elsewhere?
[21:46:33] <james-stoup> forgive my ignorance, but what is the process for getting write permission? and yes, it is hosted on github 
[21:46:49] <Demosthenex> james-stoup: worg is just a git repo. there should be a page about how to apply for access
[21:47:41] <james-stoup> ok well I will look for that. I must have missed it when I first looked around
[21:50:17] <james-stoup> Demosthenex: thanks
[21:50:45] <Demosthenex> james-stoup: alternatively, if it's just add a link, you can give me details and i can add
[21:51:55] <james-stoup> Demosthenex: Sure, that is fine. I posted this on reddit/com/r/orgmode and someone suggested I post it there. But here you go: https://github.com/james-stoup/emacs-org-mode-tutorial
[21:52:18] <Demosthenex> and how would you like it describe on the tutorial page?
[21:53:24] <james-stoup> well it is meant as an intro for users totally new to Org Mode
[21:54:04] <Demosthenex> i saw it pass by in the reddit feed, i like the emphasis on workflows, but the first few paragraphs are just... emotional
[21:54:06] <james-stoup> and it includes example workflows, screenshots, and the configuration code that new users can copy and use
[21:54:31] <james-stoup> ha! I got that feedback from several people. I will rework it to take some of the emotion out of it
[21:54:46] <Demosthenex> fact is, org-mode is supposed to be simple.
[21:55:00] <Demosthenex> the basic use case, take notes in an outline hierarchy, is the core
[21:55:09] <james-stoup> I love Org Mode now, but I found it very overwhelming initially. 
[21:55:10] <Demosthenex> everything else is an addons, which emacs allows because it's trivial to enhance
[21:55:35] <Demosthenex> but what you were told initially "just play with it" is actually valid
[21:56:07] <james-stoup> I have invested hundreds of hours playing with emacs, endlessly tweaking stuff, and getting this "just right"
[21:56:10] <Demosthenex> the HUGE fully integrated org-mode workflows you hear some people talk about, they are fragile, use case specific, and tailored to one person's config. there's nothing org can provide out of the box.
[21:56:19] <james-stoup> which is why I'm currently teaching myself lisp, because I want to do more
[21:56:29] <Demosthenex> if you just play with the outline, and learn the basics, that's 90% of it
[21:56:46] <Demosthenex> most of what i hear is "how do i organize X" which is really, how do i setup my outline
[21:57:33] <Demosthenex> level 1 experience in org: write outlines, toggle visibility, learn basic states (TODO|DONE). level 2: learn agenda and timestamps. level 3: learn basic ugly vanilla exports. level 4+: exercise left to the reader
[21:57:53] <Demosthenex> doom emacs and the distributions like org-roam do little to help overcome the first few levels.
[21:58:35] <Demosthenex> it's no different than being given a stack of spiral notebooks, 3 colored pens, highlighers and sticky notes, and saying "now you're equipped to take notes and project plan"
[21:58:41] <Demosthenex> you have to *try* to see what works for you
[21:58:44] <james-stoup> I don't disagree with what you are saying and I went through all that and am happy that i did, but I wrote that doc to give new users a little bit of help so they don't have to spend so much time being frustrated 
[21:59:09] <Demosthenex> i think the best part i see is the workflow idea. that's hard to communicate
[21:59:10] <james-stoup> I would rather someone "cheat" a little and use my doc than just give up entirely
[21:59:24] <Demosthenex> learn to walk before you learn to run
[21:59:59] <james-stoup> how long have you been using emacs and org mode?
[22:10:30] <Demosthenex> emacs, maybe 2003. org-mode, 2005 or 6
[22:11:22] <ieure> Ah, a newbie.
[22:14:36] <Demosthenex> HA yeah ;]
[22:16:50] <Demosthenex> james-stoup: emacs becomes much smoother as a poweruser when you learn some lisp
[22:17:04] <Demosthenex> when you grok it, you'll wonder how you ever used anything else
[22:17:28] <Demosthenex> but i have users on emacs. my wife writes fiction in org-mode on windoze. my son uses emacs in a terminal to take notes for school projects.
[22:17:32] <Demosthenex> jsut flat plain org files
[22:18:24] <Demosthenex> really is a killer outline editor, that's where people should start

[23:00:47] <james-stoup> I love asking questions. I will ask questions here until someone bans me.
[23:01:03] <Demosthenex> i made a dedicated effort to learn common lisp in .... 2012? as a result, now i think i should have learned lisp first in school instead of pascal and c.
[23:01:17] <Demosthenex> well, i'm a volunteer moderator. you haven't done anything ban worthy yet ;]
[23:01:30] <james-stoup> Pascal? 
[23:01:39] <james-stoup> what are you, 70?
[23:01:42] <Demosthenex> i like common lisp's consistency and the repl, but emacs lisp is fully integrated.
[23:01:48] <Demosthenex> wow. no. 45
[23:01:51] <james-stoup> LOL
[23:02:01] <james-stoup> sorry, I couldn't resist 
[23:02:10] <Demosthenex> in my highschool they taught turbo pascal in CS. i learned assembly because pascal was too slow
[23:02:28] <james-stoup> that is a very old-person sentence you just wrote 
[23:02:31] <Demosthenex> c, c++. so many langs i've worked with... shell, tcl/tk, perl, python, etc... 
[23:02:43] <Demosthenex> its the year 2022 and i read my email in a terminal.
[23:02:49] <james-stoup> ha ha ha
[23:02:55] <james-stoup> at least you don't have a punch card story
[23:02:56] <Demosthenex> exactly
[23:03:09] <Demosthenex> no, i was in HS during the pc revolution
[23:03:22] <Demosthenex> cut my teeth on 1200 baud modems
[23:03:42] <Demosthenex> met my wife on a MUD hosted in sweden at 9600 baud via telnet before there were web browsers.
[23:03:50] <james-stoup> when you start telling a punch card story, suspenders suddenly appear on your clothes and your beard grows 2 inches
[23:04:00] <Demosthenex> not a grey beard eyt
[23:04:03] <Demosthenex> s/ety/yet/
[23:04:56] <james-stoup> I think it is great that in 2022 we are on IRC talking about learning lisp 
[23:05:11] <Demosthenex> yep. irc never dies.
[23:05:18] <Demosthenex> so about your tutorial, i'm reading thru it
[23:05:23] <Demosthenex> my advice, ditch the top ;]
[23:05:31] <james-stoup> ha! ok
[23:05:33] <Demosthenex> also, you know you don't have to define tags to use them?
[23:05:46] <james-stoup> I know, but I liked colorizing them
[23:05:48] <Demosthenex> you only have to if you want to colorize them or give a hotkey
[23:05:53] <Sario> A tool's longevity is a good indicator of it's robustness 
[23:06:02] <james-stoup> and I wasn't sure if people would catch on if I didn't define them first 
[23:06:04] <Demosthenex> Sario: indeed. 
[23:06:12] <james-stoup> I didn't want it to seem too arbitrary 
[23:06:14] <Demosthenex> james-stoup: so, i'd like your opinion.
[23:06:22] <james-stoup> you look good in a hat
[23:06:31] <Demosthenex> elisp configuration snippets (ie: (setq org-variable-X Y)) fly over the head of new yers
[23:06:32] <james-stoup> I have other opinions too
[23:06:38] <Demosthenex> users... yet your have them in your doc
[23:06:39] <james-stoup> sorry, continue 
[23:06:46] <Demosthenex> i do look good in a hat ;]
[23:07:27] <Demosthenex> if you're trying to help new people learn a workflow, wouldn't it be better to demonstrate ones that need little configuration?
[23:07:39] <Demosthenex> if you have to drop to elisp to "prettify" it, you add something hard
[23:08:43] *** Quits: gareppa (~gareppa@user/gareppa) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:08:49] <james-stoup> I see what you mean. I guess I should have made it clearer in the comments, but what I was going for was almost a prepackaged set of solutions 
[23:09:06] <james-stoup> and yes, some of the bits weren't exactly easy
[23:09:13] <Demosthenex> so.... a fragile vertically integrated highly customized 5 pool mansion? ;]
[23:09:21] <james-stoup> but maybe I should wrap that in a comment saying "this is magic for now, come back when you understand it"
[23:09:33] <james-stoup> ha! 
[23:09:42] <Demosthenex> or, "here's what we're doing", then later "lets make this prettier"
[23:09:50] <Demosthenex> many new users dont' get editing init.el at all.
[23:09:58] <Demosthenex> the whole customize interface is good for that
[23:10:22] <Demosthenex> and yes, org mode assumes basic emacs knowledge that newcomers dont' have when they hear the siren call of org-mode and come running
[23:10:26] <Demosthenex> they are confused  ;]
[23:11:13] <james-stoup> yeah, I'm trying to walk the line between too simple and too complex. If I make it too simple then they will get bored with just making outlines and never go any further. But you can't just dump them into the 5 pool mansion because then that blows their minds.
[23:11:27] <james-stoup> Sario: Also I didn't mean to ignore you. Hi!
[23:11:46] <Demosthenex> james-stoup: that's what everyone trying to communicate concepts for org faces.
[23:11:56] <Sario> james-stoup: it's fine, I'm just lurking :)
[23:11:59] <Demosthenex> and we don't have a team writing docs or doing user training ;]
[23:12:14] <Demosthenex> honestly, if you don't know lisp, the best way to contribute is to document and teach
[23:12:20] <Demosthenex> ... which is what i try to help with ;]
[23:12:28] <Demosthenex> i know lisp, but the size of org-mode boggles me.
[23:12:46] <Demosthenex> Sario: lurk away good sir! ;]
[23:14:44] <james-stoup> Demosthenex: If you have any specific feedback on the doc you can directly message me so we don't totally clutter up this channel. I will revisit the first couple of chunks as per your suggestion. It is going to take me a day or two because I'm in the middle of switching jobs (in real life I'm a C++/Java/Ruby/Python developer) but I will clean it up some.
[23:14:49] <Demosthenex> irc is always ask and wait, or look at on occasion to see if the conversation interests you. no logs, it's all interactive and async.
[23:15:10] <Demosthenex> james-stoup: no clutter as long as i'm not pasting huge lines ;] this is perfectly on topic
[23:15:19] <Demosthenex> also, maybe others will read it and provide feedback
[23:15:29] <Demosthenex> channel activity attracts attention, causing more activity ;]
[23:15:46] <james-stoup> and if you have any specific code changes, additions, or other use cases that I'm missing please hit me up. If for no other reason that I will incorporate them into my own workflow.
[23:16:01] <Demosthenex> i have my timestamp workflow i need to document. :P
[23:16:32] <james-stoup> I'd like to know more about that. I have struggled with how to use timetamps effectively 
[23:16:33] <Demosthenex> also, if you're open to it, it may be a good idea to apply for write access to worg. if you're open to reposting your tutorial there when you update it instead of having it on github
[23:17:09] <james-stoup> I have no problem adding it to worg, either as a link to github or directly, if that is preferred. 
[23:17:26] <james-stoup> I need to find the page for applying for write access
[23:17:31] <Demosthenex> emacs/org is one of the FSF projects that avoids github, and it means you could consider your post a first draft, and publish the real one on worg ;]
[23:17:39] <Demosthenex> no page, just mail the ML.
