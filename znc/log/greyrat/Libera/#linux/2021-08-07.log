[03:47:05] <CyL> I was thinking of setting up a RAID volume from 4 4TB HDD's, but after reading a few articles online I'm completely lost on what to do. I just wanted to join them to have a larger partition (I'm willing to store a bunch of videos), and was thinking of sacrificing one of them for parity to get some fault tolerance. From what I have read, this would make my setup less reliable?

[03:47:53] <danieldg> CyL: depends on how you do it.  You've described raid5 there, which makes it tolerate one disk failure

[03:48:19] *** Quits: WishBoy (~WishBoy@user/wishboy) (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)
[03:49:05] <danieldg> CyL: you might look at raid6 (two parity drives, but higher performance cost) which would increase reliability and give you more time to replace a failed drive
[03:49:20] <CyL> danieldg: yes, I was thinking of RAID5, since with 4 disks RAID10 would give me more or less the same reliability and performance increase as RAID1, if I understood it correctly.
[03:49:25] <uwharrie> Another option would be RAID1+0 but you won't get as big of an increase
[03:49:48] <uwharrie> ...in capacity
[03:50:00] <danieldg> a big problem with raid5 is that when one drive dies, the rebuild takes quite a while and is stressful on the drives -> high chance of making a second failure

[03:51:16] <bparker> well zfs has raidz
[03:51:22] <danieldg> (and rely on the zfs raid code)
[03:51:36] <CyL> danieldg: Yeah, that's what I just read, an interesting article on the probabilities of it. With certain setups it is 15 times more likely to have a read error that screws everything up on the rebuild process than have a second drive failing, so just keep it as is, seems the reasonable thing to do.
[03:52:25] <bparker> raid5 (among others) also has the 'write hole' problem
[03:52:27] <bparker> raidz does not
[03:52:59] <danieldg> raid6 doesn't have that issue, and can tolerate any 2 drives failing unlike with raid0+1.  But raid6 does need a lot more cpu, and has the write hole issue

[03:55:04] <danieldg> or just use an fs that writes two copies

[05:43:58] <Sabinno> I tried. I use CentOS 8. And it's not stable enough to prevent this: https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/07/red-hat-and-centos-systems-arent-booting-due-to-boothole-patches/

[14:28:33] <Bushmaster> h9owdy folks, i am wondering does anyone installed Pentaho in Linux successfully?
[14:29:14] <geirha> I'm guessing paulcarroty means the ability to use multiple regex replacements. E.g. change all foo to bar and all bar to foo. And so just putting two s commands in sequence won't cut it 's/foo/bar/g; s/bar/foo/g'  as all foo will end up as foo again
[14:29:42] <paulcarroty> exactly
[14:29:46] <evilop> Bushmaster: its horrible java so in teory it should run
[14:29:55] <evilop> it it will run correctly though....

[15:47:27] <CyL> on top of that a smal 256GB SSD to be used as a caching device. The machine is not expected to have high availability, there aren't many scientists either. They are even excpeted to shut the machine down once they're done.

[23:49:18] <digital_mystik> hello.. for anyone using the aerc email client out there, is there a way to have pasted text respect line breaks as if it was just typed out? For instance just writing an email has everything in a neat block that breaks to the next line after a given length, but if a long line is pasted in my case, it ends up just being a really long line outside of the line break boundary. Not really sure if that is a setting for vim/nvim or maybe t
[23:49:18] <digital_mystik> just inherent to plain text emails? Sorry if this is a noobie question (new to using a TUI email client), just seeing if there is a way to have it all uniform regardless of typing/editing/pasting. thanks
