[14:48:59] <M6piz7wk[m]> nydel: volunteers and supporters are the most important without us FSF is nothing 
[14:50:58] <M6piz7wk[m]> What i argue about is that FSF is not engaging enough with next generation and general public to spread what Free Software is and why is it important
[14:51:19] <M6piz7wk[m]> People also said that they are waiting too long for things which was also my experience so i would argue for better resource management
[14:51:37] <nydel> M6piz7wk[m]: i know the FSF is nothing without us. we are boots on the ground. i asked why we shoudl think we have a voice that matters to the board.
[14:51:42] <nydel> respectfully.
[14:51:46] <M6piz7wk[m]> i also like the idea of creating something like `World Free Software Foundation` by combining all members from the FSF network + FSAustralia
[14:52:07] <M6piz7wk[m]> nydel: because we do and it's in the best interest of the board to listen to us
[14:52:17] <M6piz7wk[m]> and FSF always listen to us from my current experience O.o

[14:53:18] <AndrewYu> I don't find any free software communities in China, sad
[14:53:36] *** Joins: snowdrone (~snowdrone@user/snowdrone)
[14:54:04] <DiffieHellman> I guess that kind of freedom isn't really allowed?
[14:55:13] <M6piz7wk[m]> AndrewYu: i though that china is free software community? O.o
[14:55:15] <M6piz7wk[m]> even hardware apparently
[14:55:18] <M6piz7wk[m]> seems like a nice place
[14:56:16] <DiffieHellman> Lots of business in China like treating the GPL the same as pushover licenses.
[14:56:30] <AndrewYu> Unsure what pushover licenses are
[14:56:43] <M6piz7wk[m]> afaik china doesn't recognize copyright
[14:56:49] <M6piz7wk[m]> so feels nice
[14:56:50] <DiffieHellman> There are plenty that meet GPL obligations, but lots that don't.
[14:57:21] <AndrewYu> "China doesn't recognize copyright"---I recall a few years ago our social studies schoolbook included copyright law stuff
[14:57:30] <M6piz7wk[m]> o.o
[14:57:31] <AndrewYu> It might be different from US copyright law, but at least the GPL is valid
[14:57:50] <DiffieHellman> AndrewYu: Pushover licences are licences like the MIT or 2-clause BSD that permit you to take the source and make proprietary software from it.
[14:58:36] <M6piz7wk[m]> lot of chinese developers/manufacturers are choosing to go open-source though
[14:58:39] <AndrewYu> http://english.www.gov.cn/archive/laws_regulations/2014/08/23/content_281474982987430.htm
[14:58:57] <M6piz7wk[m]> like china doesn't seem to have proprietary in the culture like we do in the EU and you do in US
[14:59:10] <AndrewYu> M6piz7wk[m]: Yes, they're going "open-source"
[14:59:24] <AndrewYu> few people go 自由, most of them go 开源
[14:59:41] <AndrewYu> 自由(free), 开源(open-source)
[15:00:03] <M6piz7wk[m]> i don't mind limiting freedom to maintain economy
[15:00:14] <AndrewYu> I like that fact that 自由 can be used a an adjective for "libre", which doesn't mean "gratis" in any form
[15:00:20] <M6piz7wk[m]> but the thing is that enabling freedom supports economy.. some people just take a long time to realize it
[15:00:28] <DiffieHellman> This isn't the place to champion proprietary software and open source,
[15:00:39] <M6piz7wk[m]> i ain't championing it
[15:00:43] <M6piz7wk[m]> i see that as natural evolution
[15:01:08] <M6piz7wk[m]> if they feel like that they should be proprietary and close source then let them 
[15:01:45] <AndrewYu> M6piz7wk[m]: What exactly do you mean "proprietary in culture"
[15:01:48] <M6piz7wk[m]> well at least what i do.. and usually companies that i associate with go freedom shortly after :P
[15:02:02] <AndrewYu> DiffieHellman: I believe that discussing it is okay
[15:02:38] <M6piz7wk[m]> AndrewYu: we have exclusivity, premium and implying that it's best quality and stuff..
[15:02:38] <M6piz7wk[m]> I rather prefer open to everyone and designed for it's safety factor with materials that fit the design
[15:02:45] <Whistler> well, GPL violation might be more common for chinese companies (eg. mobile phone manufacturers) though
[15:02:48] <M6piz7wk[m]> which is what china does really well
[15:02:56] <DiffieHellman> Discussing it is great, but supporting it is the opposite of the channels ideas
[15:03:23] <M6piz7wk[m]> I am not comfortable taking legal action for chinese developers to take my libre code and making it proprietary though
[15:03:24] <Whistler> many do not release their modified linux kernel source code
[15:03:47] <DiffieHellman> Mostly because they don't realize they need to.
[15:03:52] <M6piz7wk[m]> like i would immediately in EU and US, but i feel like china has different way to using the code that i don't disagree with and even prefer at some areas
[15:04:01] *** Linux77_ is now known as Linux77
[15:04:02] <DiffieHellman> Most will provide it if you ask I'm pretty sure
[15:04:22] <M6piz7wk[m]> i don't like asking i prefer them releasing it on their own
[15:04:46] <M6piz7wk[m]> bcs in terms of ecomony companies do whatever they can do make more money or whatever is in their business plan..
[15:04:53] <DiffieHellman> It's not acceptable to make proprietary malware (especially so) with GPL'd software no matter which country you are in.
[15:05:03] <M6piz7wk[m]> and going libre is very economically supportive
[15:05:32] <M6piz7wk[m]> DiffieHellman: i argue that we should look at things from more points of view and interests 
[15:05:55] <DiffieHellman> I look at things from many points of view and I select the correct one.
[15:06:01] <M6piz7wk[m]> bcs i am sueing the hell out of german using my libre software for proprietary something, but i am fine with chinese using it for proprietary 
[15:06:15] <M6piz7wk[m]> bcs they culturarely follow our values and will eventually make it libre on their own
[15:06:24] <M6piz7wk[m]> which so far was the case with everything that chinese ppl used from me
[15:06:43] <M6piz7wk[m]> DiffieHellman: i don't believe there being the correct one as that is biased
[15:06:51] <M6piz7wk[m]> i rather take pros and cons and then make a decision
[15:07:03] <AndrewYu> Intereesting point
[15:07:33] <M6piz7wk[m]> yep :p that's why i like china so much
[15:08:18] <AndrewYu> Yeah, it seems that we do share alot
[15:08:20] <AndrewYu> * a lot
[15:10:49] <M6piz7wk[m]> like socialism and liberalism is not different in this area.. i would even argue that we are more restrictive as we mandate the new source code released under the same license
[15:11:53] <M6piz7wk[m]> but that's mostly bcs EU and US would just proprietary the shit out of it and declared themself a king of the world compared to china and alike who would actually share those with others
[15:13:26] <M6piz7wk[m]> someone should explain that in EU so that i can build a phone without having to suck a d!%! of pine64 u.u
[15:14:26] <DPA> China and sharing? That doesn't sound right.
[15:14:52] <kompowiec2[x]> West ban because copytight, East because pr0n
[15:15:01] <M6piz7wk[m]> eh? China was always very sharing 
[15:15:06] <M6piz7wk[m]> at least from my experience
[15:15:06] <kompowiec2[x]> copyright*
[15:15:23] <M6piz7wk[m]> well excluding things that might harm the national safety and stuff but that's understandable 🤔
[15:15:55] <kompowiec2[x]> it is indeed something to be proud of /s
[15:17:34] <M6piz7wk[m]> eh? I don't like how copyright works it blocks any kind of progression 
[15:18:19] <AndrewYu> I hate patents more than copyright though
[15:19:22] <M6piz7wk[m]> patents for software ain't a thing

[19:27:12] <tfisgnag> both licences in the same folder and have opened the terminal and entered diff -c LICENSE agpl-3.0.txt > diff-output
[19:29:16] <tfisgnag> That has opened in my Trisquel's Caja , in the same folder where both licences are a new file: diff-output
[19:30:03] <tfisgnag> I will open it to see its content.
[19:30:39] <craigt> Hi everybody!  It is time for this week's Free Software Directory meeting.
[19:31:02] <craigt> If you are new or just want a refresher, check out the participation guidelines. https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Free_Software_Directory:Participate
[19:31:07] *** Joins: anonymeowo (~anonymeow@5.34.180.230)

[19:32:12] <tfisgnag> I will use geany instead of pluma. I don't know how to code but I am more familiar with it than with pluma (that is trisquel's default)
[19:33:58] <craigt> tfisgnag: <https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Geany> Cool. I had not heard that name before.
[19:34:26] <craigt> tfisgnag: So the diff-output should show you the two licenses are the same and now changes have been made.
[19:34:30] <tfisgnag> what name?
[19:34:39] <craigt> tfisgnag: geany
[19:35:15] <tfisgnag> its a sort of ide that can be used as a text processor.
[19:36:15] <tfisgnag> So no changes have been made?
[19:37:47] <craigt> tfisgnag: It appears no changes have been made. Does your diff-output show something different?
[19:38:47] * craigt is looking at https://directory.fsf.org/wiki?title=Special:RecentChanges to see what activity we've had this week.
[19:40:31] *** Joins: RedSoxFan07 (~Thunderbi@d-159-250-218-50.ct.cpe.atlanticbb.net)
[19:41:48] <craigt> [APPROVED] https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Mastodon [(Minor updates)]
[19:42:11] <tfisgnag> craigt: The diff-output file that the command created is  47 lines long. I am not familiar with these outputs. I had never used them before. So I think I should practice with some test files before giving your question a trustworthy answer.
[19:43:13] *** Quits: sbooch (~sbooch@user/sbooch) (Quit: leaving)
[19:43:16] <craigt> tfisgnag: Sounds good. I did it on my end as well, and can confirm there are no changes to their copy of the AGPLv3.

[19:44:59] <tfisgnag> sorry didnt see your answer
[19:47:58] <tfisgnag> I could postpone/delay studying the diff-output command output for after this meeting ends if you don't mind .
[19:48:47] <tfisgnag> In the mean time you could teach me what other things I must learn to do to see if Mailvelope is still accepted by the FSD
[19:48:58] <tfisgnag> If you don't mind
[19:49:14] <craigt> tfisgnag: Let's move forward.

[19:50:42] <tfisgnag> craigt OK. What else should I learndo to reach my goal ?
[19:50:52] <craigt> tfisgnag: generally speaking with the AGPLv3 license in the main directory and the declaration that the project is licensed under the AGPLv3 in the README.md file we can say which license the project is using.
[19:51:15] <craigt> tfisgnag: But now we need to check the code base for other licenses.

[19:56:30] <craigt> tfisgnag: There are several ways to go about this, including manually looking at all the code files, but that is not efficient.
[19:57:32] <tfisgnag> Please teach me what you think is the most efficient method.
[19:57:59] <tfisgnag> I am not only interested in knowing if the FSD aproves

Should that be changed to reflect the package name? Various other things have changed that I'll update as well like the website...

[20:09:31] <craigt> user9: looking at AAFAQ
[20:09:53] <user9> craigt: cool
[20:13:12] <kompowiec> any ideas for a neutral term for "freetard"?
[20:13:46] <craigt> kompowiec: What? Please don't.
[20:14:15] <panosalevro> today i will be creating some pages for terminal emulators i didn't find on the directory
[20:14:43] <craigt> user9: Is there a current site for aafaq?
[20:14:43] <kompowiec> i edit librepanet now and i stuck because I don't want to use that ugly term. 
[20:16:11] <craigt> kompowiec: Fair enough. But we are having the FSD meeting at the moment.
[20:16:31] <user9> craigt: it seems to be anarchistfaq.org. The email address listed there when you follow the links is the same as listed on AAFAQ, being ananarchist@yahoo.com I believe
[20:16:39] <kompowiec> ach right, sorry
[20:16:58] <kompowiec> I haven't read.
[20:17:23] <craigt> kompowiec: How are you being forced to use that term? You can DM me if you want, or maybe take it up in #libreplanet.
[20:17:33] <user9> craigt: also, that's the website listed when I apt show anarchism
[20:18:08] <kompowiec> eg. i want add " Who are the major FLOSS thinkers?" or something like that
[20:19:31] <kompowiec> yes, FLOSS is neutral but for obvious reasons I am not going to mix both terms with each other.
[20:20:36] <craigt> user9: I'm not sure AAFAQ is an actual program. Hrm...
[20:21:10] <user9> craigt: yep good point I don't think it is.

[20:32:31] <user9> craigt: I found it but it only exists in /usr/share/doc, and the README says the following: This package will install both the HTML and Markdown-formatted versions of the

[20:32:35] <user9> directories, respectively. If you are interested in setting up a mirror of

[20:46:09] <user9> installs
[20:47:26] <user9> craigt: I'll leave that one alone and move on to others.

[21:56:44] <craigt> panosalevro: It is just my best educated guess. If we really wanted to figured it out, we should reach out to the project.
[21:57:19] <panosalevro> craigt: i think joe wilm is the main author. pretty sure there are many developers
[21:57:33] <panosalevro> perhaps Joe Wilm & contributors would be safer
[21:58:00] <craigt> panosalevro: Agreed.

[22:24:58] *** Joins: user9 (~ZZZZZ@gateway/tor-sasl/zzzzz)
[22:27:56] <panosalevro> craigt: im not sure how i can differentiate between the two.
[22:28:58] <craigt> It has to be declared somewhere, for example in the README or in the code files license/copyright notification headers.
[22:29:48] *** Quits: user9 (~ZZZZZ@gateway/tor-sasl/zzzzz) (Remote host closed the connection)
[22:30:12] <panosalevro> oh ok. i thought this was actually the default behavior of the GPL. i thought that the "only" part would have to be declared, not the "or later" part
[22:30:16] <craigt> with kitty, it has the LICENSE file (which is GPLv3), the README file doesn't say anything about licensing, but most of the code files say, 'Distributed under terms of the GPL3 license."

[22:35:06] <craigt> panosalevro: The licensing info should always be in the code base.
[22:35:39] *** Joins: lethu (~lethu@user/lethu)
[22:35:41] <craigt> panosalevro: A copy of the license, details in the README, and then a header on every code file would be optimal.

[22:37:47] <panosalevro> craigt: right, i see
[22:37:48] <craigt> panosalevro: Thanks! I changed the license to GPLv3 and updated the download link to a specific version.
