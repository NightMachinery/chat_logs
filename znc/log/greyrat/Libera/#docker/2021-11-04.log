[03:15:58] <arkanoid> wez: you know plex (the dlna media server) and traefik (the web reverse proxy)? To make dlna work on local network I have to run plex in network mode "host" or with "macvlan", but to make it visible to traefik (that's running in bridge mode) I have to rely on hacks outside docker
[03:16:39] <arkanoid> this is because a macvlan container is visible from local network hosts, but not from docker host itself
[03:16:56] <arkanoid> so I cannot have dlna and reverse proxy at the same time
[03:17:54] <wez> Wouldn't bridging it just do it
[03:18:20] <arkanoid> wez: with bridging dlna server won't work. It relies on broadcast/multicast
[03:18:34] <arkanoid> that's why it requires running in host mode or macvlan
[03:19:07] <wez> arkanoid: all of which run over the IP layer which is above the mac layer that bridging does
[03:19:50] <arkanoid> sure, but dlna clients are not containers
[03:20:13] <wez> and?
[03:20:36] <arkanoid> and dlna won't work in bridge
[03:20:57] <wez> if it's using multicast then there is no reason why it won't
[03:21:06] <wez> you just need to setup the routing correctly
[03:21:27] <wez> having it running on a container won't change anything
[03:23:12] <arkanoid> a broadcast/multicast packet originating from container won't reach host neighbours

[04:48:01] <arkanoid> basically to isolate a dlna service I need a macvlan, but to use a reverse proxy in front of it I need the double macvlan hack
[04:48:43] <arkanoid> I've solved using a vm just for the container running in host mode, so that the reverse proxy can reach it
[04:48:50] <programmerq> arkanoid▸ attach the traefik container to the macvlan driver-- containers can be on more than one network.
[04:49:51] <arkanoid> seems that a container can't be in a bridged and macvlan network at same time, at least I've found no documentation how to do that in docker-compose
[04:50:09] <programmerq> what error do you get?
[04:52:37] <programmerq> it shouldn't matter what driver the networks are, just put both of them into the compose file and specify on the service that it should be on both.

[05:08:36] <arkanoid> programmerq: do you have an example of the syntax to put a service in both a macvlan and a bridged network?
[05:09:00] <programmerq> define both networks in the compose file, and then put both of them in the networks: key on the service that you want connected to both.
[05:11:00] <arkanoid> problem is the syntax to put them both in the "networks:" key of service. macvlan requires "networks: mymacvlan: ipv4_address: "192.168.1.2""
[05:11:22] <arkanoid> so the usual list of bridged networks doesn't work
[05:13:39] <programmerq> "doesn't work" -- again, what error are you getting?
[05:13:49] <programmerq> you can absolutely have sub options
[05:13:56] <programmerq> and still have multiple networks
[05:14:09] <programmerq> do you just need to adjust indentation?
[05:15:19] <pycurious> does anyone have a good python docker cleanup script? :)
[05:15:25] <arkanoid> I've tried many different combinations of possible syntax, but failed, and lacking of docs/examples convinced me that that was not possible
[05:16:21] <programmerq> "failed" -- show your compose file and the error you are getting.
[05:22:54] <arkanoid> just any compose with a macvlan and the default bridged network. Also the official plex template shows a network section without the "default" bridged network https://github.com/plexinc/pms-docker/blob/master/docker-compose-macvlan.yml.template
[05:24:58] <arkanoid> or something like https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/8xn3yx/comment/e2bbtse/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3 (but ip_range and gateway options works only for compose file version <=2)
[05:28:56] <programmerq> both of those examples only have one network on the service, not two.
