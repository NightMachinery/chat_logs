[00:00:11] <pompolic> consider me sleep conversation georg
[00:00:43] <meowcat> the screwy one that's happened to me more recently is waking up and feeling like not all subunits of consciousness are online. like, talking and memory are there but somehow it's not clear that actions can hook up into plans?
[00:01:14] <meowcat> it worried me that i might have had some kind of stroke, but the missing parts seemed to come online an hour or so later.
[00:01:15] <pompolic> yeah it's basically like  that, except i don't think i have memory
[00:01:44] <pompolic> seems to weakly correspond to having to awaken quickly
[00:03:26] <gwern> 'We have been thinking about pivoting a little bit more to work in Europe, where if you just compare the E.U. policy response to the Great Recession to the American one, I think there’s a huge gap. And also frankly, the recoveries to the Great Recession — as much as I complained about the U.S. policy response, the degree of self-inflicted wounds by European monetary policymakers is I...
[00:03:32] <gwern> ...think genuinely somewhat astonishing.   Rob Wiblin: I guess in the U.S. they’re slightly worried that possibly the pendulum has swung too far in the other direction. People always respond to the last thing that went wrong, and now we’ve over-learned the lesson from 2008. But in the E.U., it doesn’t seem like people have learned the lesson from 2008 all that much. It seems like the...
[00:03:38] <gwern> ...E.U. would basically go and do exactly the same thing again. Which is strange.'
[00:04:51] <gwern> (I've always had a vague impression that the EU elites regarded 2008 as essentially a success because it made america look bad, and the bailouts were an crisis-opportunity for welding together the euro and thus EU even more, which as a quasi-religious mission is worth any amount of mere money or gdp or wellbeing)
[00:05:32] <pompolic> being mostly aphasic after waking up is a common experience, but i can bully my brain into talking if need be. the more interesting part is that i am effectively blind, not because i don't see, but because processing sight also seems offline
[00:05:43] <pompolic> except apparently i can navigate a crowd in that state as it once happened
[00:07:19] <gwern> 'So I’m curious to know whether you have any great, entertaining, or interesting stories from the earlier — and no doubt far more scrappy — days of GiveWell back in 2011, 2012, 2013.'   '...another fun, early, small GiveWell moment was at one point that first year, we went bowling and GiveWell paid for a pitcher of beer. And I think we realized it was the first time GiveWell had ever...
[00:07:25] <gwern> ...paid for alcohol for a staff event. I think we ended up sending multiple donors a photo of the receipt to show that we were growing up, we were becoming legitimate, and look how we’re spending your money.'

[00:45:36] <Ralith> Obormot\Arcturus: so my old crappy toaster oven just blew up and I'm trying to decide whether to replace it with a new one, or just start using my full-size gas oven for toaster oven tasks like broiling a few slices of bread or bagels or reheating one or two slices of pizza; any thoughts?
[00:45:37] <meowcat> wouldn't it be easier to just draw some kind of special stripe on the places that cars _are_ allowed to go?
[00:46:07] <meowcat> then if someone decides to wear that pattern on their clothes and they become a car magnet, it's their own dang fault
[00:46:51] <meowcat> "sorry, i couldn't let the robot drive all the way to your house, they haven't put the purple dots on your street yet"
[00:47:12] <ggreer> the one way "street" was in a private parking lot. there was no "one way" sign, just an arrow painted on the ground
[00:47:55] <ggreer> there doesn't seem to be much of a standard for what bus lanes are supposed to be, and you are allowed to go in the bus lanes if it's to turn onto another street
[00:49:12] <meowcat> when i took the california driving test and got to the part about how you're supposed to drive when there are streetcars and trolleys, i thought of just asking, "if i promise to never drive in SF, can i skip this part?"
[00:51:57] <ggreer> another error is caused by solid white lines that (if you follow the rules of the road), make it impossible to get into those onramp lanes

[00:57:43] <Betawolf> wow, vermont is cool
[00:57:51] <meowcat> reproductive anarchy sounds kinda awesome.
[00:58:07] <meowcat> i mean, just as a name for something.
[00:58:32] <meowcat> it seems like it should mean "if you want to give birth to a turtle-person, but you're a boy human who likes butterflies, you totally can still do that."
[00:59:34] <Betawolf> abortion right up to delivery gets pretty weird. I mean, at that point you may as well extend it up until they hit the age of majority.
[00:59:40] <meowcat> actually reading the article ... um, yeah, well, it's a step in the direction of turtle people.
[01:00:52] <Ralith> Betawolf: I mean, empirically the line should probably be drawn somewhere between those points, but that would make people too uncomfortable :P
[01:01:29] <Betawolf> (being permitted to just kill your kids at will would really take the edge off parenting anxiety)
[01:02:10] <meowcat> prenatal adoption is still difficult
[01:02:55] <meowcat> "if you object to abortion, why haven't you volunteered to host a fetus transplant yet?"
[01:03:33] <quanticle> "Reproductive Anarchy" is a great punk/ska band name
[01:04:29] <meowcat> i mean, it sounds like a term that some racial supremacist would have used to mean "interracial babies" too.
[01:05:02] <meowcat> "you can't date her! that might lead to reproductive anarchy!"
[01:05:07] <Betawolf> there's family planning, and there's reproductive anarchy
[01:05:29] <quanticle> So wait, is the opposite of a one-child policy "reproductive anarchy"?
[01:05:48] <kanzure> keeping government out of reproduction seems like a good idea to me
[01:05:59] <meowcat> it's certainly better than reproductive democracy. i don't want anyone to be elected pregnant.
[01:06:01] <kanzure> but i have ulterior motives
[01:06:48] <meowcat> (do not think too hard about 'elected pregnant', it gets horrifying fast)
[01:07:00] <Betawolf> Most of the things the article wants you to be scared of sound fine. 
[01:07:26] <quanticle> Yeah, the more I read this article the more awesome it sounds. I get to piss off religious nutjobs *and* bioethicists? At the same time? Be still my beating heart!
[01:07:38] <Betawolf> I mean, devastating to the social fabric, but that's in tatters anyway so we should at least get superhuman kids out of it.
[01:07:57] <quanticle> Yeah, god forbid, we might actually solve the transplant organ shortage.
[01:07:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ralith: I think replace. I get a heck of a lot of use out of my toaster oven. Also, not all of a toaster oven's functions are even replaceable by a normal oven (at least, not ovens I've seen)
[01:08:16] <Ralith> elaborate?
[01:08:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well ovens don't do the "toast" thing.
[01:08:43] <quanticle> >Use of artificial womb to gestate a baby, whether or not needed for the health of the fetus 
[01:08:45] <quanticle> Better and better
[01:08:51] <Ralith> my oven has a pretty solid broiler
[01:09:02] <quanticle> I, for one, welcome our artificial womb test-tube PGS baby overlords
[01:09:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> Broiler is top only though usually
[01:09:17] <meowcat> thread reproductive anarchy, broiler now has a bun in the oven
[01:09:23] <Betawolf> 'Two womb babies' is the dumbest thing on there.
[01:10:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ralith: Anyway, using the oven for toaster oven tasks just seems unwieldy and inconvenient to me. YMMV I guess...
[01:10:16] <meowcat> the new kenmore toaster-womb-nursery-bot can raise your dough and your fetuses
[01:10:22] <quanticle> "WESLEY J. SMITH is an author and a senior fellow at the Discovery Institute’s Center on Human Exceptionalism." <-- I like how the 'Center for Human Exceptionalism' is *actually* devoted to making sure that humans remain as *unexceptional* as possible.
[01:10:24] <Ralith> there's still convective heating all around--even my last toaster oven was never going to toast the bottom of something at the same rate as the top
[01:10:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> True
[01:11:21] <quanticle> But it makes sense, in the same way that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is neither democratic nor a republic.
[01:11:40] <meowcat> i think it will be easier to grow a tank full of transplantable liver lobes than to successfully bring a fetus to term in a fully artificial womb.
[01:12:01] <Ralith> the main concern that comes to my mind is preheat time and energy efficiency, but the latter seems to be a nonissue even if gas vs. electric doesn't make it a downright win for a full size oven, and I reheated a pastry just fine in a few minutes just now, so preheating might be overblown as an issue for casual use
[01:12:20] <Ralith> what functions did you have in mind as unique to toaster ovens?
[01:12:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> Toasting, mostly
[01:12:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> I use it to warm up bread, to make open-faced cheese sandwiches
[01:13:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> I reheat stuff in it too
[01:13:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> Leftovers and such
[01:13:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's not unique of course but it comes out better with the toast function than in an oven
[01:13:43] <Ralith> I'll make a trial run of it for my usual tasks and see how it goes
[01:14:17] <Ralith> do you have a recommended toaster oven, if it does turn out to be necessary?
[01:15:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah you know I was just looking at my Amazon lists in anticipation of that question
[01:15:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> The one I have isn't made anymore (of course), and the one I had picked out as a replacement for when this goes ... well, Amazon deleted the listing and I can't even find it anymore

[01:22:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes

[01:28:39] <rmmh> quanticle: they're also equivalent to convection (toaster)? ovens
[01:28:49] <Ralith> that was the point, yes
[01:29:04] <Ralith> speaking of non-gadget food, I need to get a batch of pizza dough going
[01:29:23] <Ralith> well, no, that one relies on my food processor
[01:29:42] <Ralith> (to think I had almost started regretting that purchase!)
[01:29:49] <rmmh> the main advantage of toaster ovens in my experience is that they're much more ergonomic for small meals
[01:30:10] <rmmh> very short preheats, less cumbersome to cook with, perfect size for a couple pieces of meat / etc
[01:30:12] <Ralith> just because you don't have to bend down?
[01:30:28] <Ralith> idk, we'll see how I feel in a month
[01:30:50] <quanticle> Ralith: Yeah, my mom is very Obormot-like when it comes to cooking appliances. She bought an electric pressure cooker (some store-brand knock-off of an Instant Pot), and was *immediately* repelled by the notion of having to actually press buttons to make her cookware go. "What, it expects me to set a timer? I have no idea how long it take to cook daal. I just put it on the stove and wait for the
[01:30:52] <quanticle> pressure cooker to go whoosh three or four times. Where's the button for that?"
[01:31:08] <gwern> "two womb baby" is awful

[01:31:50] <rmmh> the texture was spot on, as you'd expect from a 160F water bath. unfortunately the water bath became an extremely weak chicken broth, and the breast became unflavored meat.

[01:50:35] <gwern> but anything neural is too expensive for realtime 4k on smartphones etc
[01:51:01] <gwern> like images. neural decoders/encoders already get great bit per pixel loss but are way too expensive to actually run
[01:52:13] <quanticle> Ah, okay. that makes sense. Well, hopefully as dedicated neural architecture gets cheaper that'll change.
[01:52:35] <gwern> but as bandwidth gets cheaper, the pressure gets less too
[01:53:09] <gwern> video/image/media codecs are optimized as much for joules these days as anythingelse, and hard to see NNs ever being close to optimal there
[01:53:10] <kuudes> I like our current limits, but I would like the social reasons thing to not to require official approval
[01:53:50] <kuudes> so up to 12 weeks basicly per mother's will, and then to... 26? 30? weeks per stricter reasons which are related to the fetus being dysfunctional or disabled etc
[01:54:49] <kuudes> also ultrasounds being free and semicompulsive
[01:55:23] <kuudes> so if you are carrying an baby with trisomy etc, you get told that when you have legal options
[01:55:38] <kuudes> basicly that is negative eugenics, sort of, I guess

[10:16:10] <ggreer> neat that they can say "our cars have driven 15M miles with this version and had zero crashes"
[10:16:32] <ggreer> apparently the legacy stack (what most people's cars are on) crashes every 5 million miles
[10:22:49] <PapuaHardyNet> what's the ethical position of the rat community on self-driving cars?
[10:23:13] <ggreer> they seem pretty safe. I've put about 12,000 self-driving miles on my car
[10:24:57] <PapuaHardyNet> whoa
[10:25:13] <PapuaHardyNet> I was under the impression that self-driving cars are still a futuristic idea
[10:25:27] <ggreer> teslas drive themselves on limited access roads (freeways)
[10:25:44] <ggreer> also they will drive in a straight line on surface streets and stop at stoplights and stop signs
[10:26:04] <ggreer> they just won't make turns for you. the FSD beta (which a couple thousand tesla drivers are in) drives everywhere
[10:26:17] <PapuaHardyNet> interesting
[10:26:38] <PapuaHardyNet> I wonder of the negative effects caused by "partially automated driving"
[10:26:41] <ggreer> but people are still worried because you can find really shitty streets where the teslas don't understand what is happening
[10:27:02] <PapuaHardyNet> teslas get confused too, of course :)
[10:27:16] <ggreer> depends on the circumstance. on long boring drives, partial automation is way better than driving yourself
[10:28:14] <ggreer> with manual cars, it didn't matter how much caffeine or modafinil I took. 10 hours of driving would make me mentally exhausted (and more prone to mistakes)
[10:28:36] <PapuaHardyNet> hmm
[10:28:48] <PapuaHardyNet> I guess automated driving would really help truckers
[10:28:52] <ggreer> with my tesla I can drive for 10 hours and be totally fine. I don't have to do all those tiny micro-corrections to keep the car in the lane (or pass a slow car or whatever)
[10:29:07] <PapuaHardyNet> really? that's incredible
[10:29:10] <ggreer> the tesla automatically signals and lane changes, brakes for slow cars, obeys speed limits, etc
[10:29:30] <ggreer> onramp to offramp with zero intervention. usually I only intervene to make the car more aggressive
[10:30:46] <ggreer> yeah this has been a thing on teslas for a few years. sadly not all of these features are available outside the US. for example: the EU limits the maximum lateral acceleration that a self-driving car can do, so teslas will run off the road in tight turns
[10:31:19] <ggreer> also the EU limits the amount of time that automated lane changes can take. I think if the lane change isn't completed 5 seconds after the initial signal, the car is required to abort

[20:31:12] <kiboneu> i want to make core wars but with a distributed filesystem over a network
[20:33:11] <gwern> the problem with core wars-esque games seems to be similar to genetic algorithms/a-life: that they always collapse to a meta around hyperoptimized simple fast agents, and never get a richer meta around much more complicated agents
[20:34:13] <gwern> (they're analogous to viral life, but they keep missing whatever it takes to get more interesting bacterial life, never mind multicellular life or ecosystems)
[20:34:42] <kiboneu> that's true
[20:35:15] <kiboneu> there should be some balancing mechanics to keep it from a single alife dominating the space
[20:35:48] <ggreer> maybe because there's no difference between communication speeds and influence speeds. in all of these environments, organisms interact at their universe's equivalent of light speed
[20:35:50] <kiboneu> hm. noisy corewars?
[20:35:55] <kiboneu> right
[20:36:33] <ggreer> while in our universe, a bacterium can get information at the speed of light (or at least the speed of sound/diffusion), but can't influence nearly that fast
[20:37:03] <kiboneu> I wonder if having heterogeneous access speeds and data reliability through the entire memory space would yield some interesting developments
[20:37:05] <kiboneu> right
[20:37:11] <gwern> there's also comparmentalization
[20:37:14] <kiboneu> right
[20:38:02] <gwern> there's a lot of differences. biggest, of course, is simply scale
[20:38:03] <ggreer> if it detects a chemical gradient or a light source, all it can do is move toward/away. it can't teleport/copy 1,000 times a second until it stumbles into the middle of the source
[20:38:14] <kiboneu> and having programs develop niches / group coordination by making it advantageous to perform in groups and whatnot
[20:38:54] <ggreer> I guess another difference is the lack of conservation laws

[20:39:19] <gwern> going for the low-level "from raw atoms" typically fails badly. every interesting multi-agent simulation has to abstract a good deal up to larger-scale agents and higher-level actions
[20:39:21] <kiboneu> oh, right. maybe have each memory cell have a lifetime / entropy function applied to it over time

[20:40:41] <kiboneu> i'm a very low level kind of guy, for the purposes of building upwards. sometimes I like to just land in the middle where all the weird architectural bugs happen, where very abstract machines have very specific lower level effects that can't be modeled on a single abstraction level
[20:40:46] <nshepperd2> heh, one of the side effects of sampling from clip/dalle with T<1.0 is it generates more extreme aspect ratios
[20:41:05] <gwern> kiboneu: don't worry, the physics simulators still have bugs...
[20:41:40] <kiboneu> yes, and wouldn't it be so much fun to turn them into exploit primitives so we can peek behind the curtain?

[20:42:23] <gwern> it would just result in cheating and collapsing to the boring micro meta

[20:43:06] <RiversHaveWings> nshepperd2: yes
[20:43:13] <kiboneu> fair, after the information gets shared
[20:43:32] <gwern> a very few small bugs can result in a delightful soupcon of emergent behavior like rocketjumping. too many bugs and it's just back to corewars: everyone does the twitching that creates a buffer overflow in the first .1s and then it's back to an extremely inefficient corewars
[20:43:43] <kiboneu> gwern: or it would result in some meta-universe construction, which might get interesting
[20:43:44] <ggreer> I don't know of any of these sorts of games that have a big difference between communication speed (light/sound) and influence speed (physically changing stuff)
[20:44:00] <kiboneu> gwern: ah i see your point
[20:44:03] <ggreer> probably because simulating the game would be 1,000x slower (since you can't bump up the comm speeds)

[21:48:07] <dbohdan> gwern: "the problem with core wars-esque games seems to be similar to genetic algorithms/a-life: that they always collapse to a meta around hyperoptimized simple fast agents"  Very true.  I remember circa 2005 downloading a well-traveled copy of a Russian bot war game where it happened.  The game ran in text mode under MS-DOS and had up to four players (one in every corner) fighting for the control of Flatland, a small 2D grid.  Each player entered the 
[21:48:07] <dbohdan> path to a source code file with assembly-like instructions; the game was non-interactive afterwards.  There were other people's bots in the archive dating back to the mid-'90s.  I thought I was clever when I wrote a dead simple bot that was like "turn around, attack, spawn a copy".  I bragged to my college friend over IM about how I'd defeated every complex "strategic" bot and sent him a copy of the game with my bot.  He soon got back to me: he'd found 
[21:48:08] <dbohdan> one bot in the archive that easily defeated mine.  It had the "turn around, attack, spawn" loop optimized down to fewer instructions.

[23:03:21] <igor> children being a couple miles away while you're staging a protest isn't endangerment
[23:03:37] <saturn2> they are guilty of being cringe
[23:03:45] <igor> they are that
[23:03:53] <sh0> And more to the point conspiracy and trespassing, which definitely did happen
[23:04:10] <ggreer> you still get charged with things even if you don't succeed at them. assault doesn't require physically harming someone (that's called battery). likewise a kidnapping charge doesn't require successfully nabbing a person. you can be charged with kidnapping even if you never touch the target
[23:04:48] <igor> why do you think they were trying to kidnap anyone?

[23:06:01] <saturn2> what was their actual plan? i can't remember all the details of that incident anymore
[23:06:35] <igor> from what I understand, their actual plan was to set up a station (a table, chairs, posters) at the cfar reunion
[23:06:46] <sh0> Hard to know. They've made claims, but those claims include "show up in sith robes to nicely talk to people" so it's unclear how honest they are.
[23:07:46] <igor> that's pretty standard college protest faire
[23:07:50] <saturn2> they brought flyers to hand out iirc
[23:07:57] <gwern> damn, ziz's technique induces glossolalia too?
