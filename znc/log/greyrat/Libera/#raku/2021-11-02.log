[19:19:50] <timo> pointy blocks and blocks are transparent to return, for example, that's an important detail. what was the difference that tripped you up?

[20:08:28] <Xliff_> Want me to mail you the output?
[20:08:54] <timo> no i was just kidding :)
[20:09:17] <timo> it's hard to see anything useful in this, it's mostly the same stuff over and over, and you can't really tell where the failures are, right?
[20:17:08] <Xliff_> Exactly
[20:17:33] <Xliff_> To whit: There are no real failures. Just failutes that occur as more compunits are loaded.
[20:19:05] <Xliff_> And the failure's exception doesn't make much sense. Why is there "No such symbol" in the large version when that symbol loads fine in the isolated one?
[20:19:14] <Xliff_> Both loads should behave the same!
[20:19:24] <Xliff_> Resource corruption?
[20:33:30] <ugexe> i doubt it has anything to do with the number of compunits loaded
[20:34:01] <ugexe> if i were to take a wild guess i would say one of the recent jit changes like getcurhllsym  seems potentially related
[20:35:05] <MasterDuke> hm. then any difference with MVM_JIT_DISABLE=1 ?

[20:52:24] <tonyo> why are you not checking if the require fails.. that will most likely give you the error message you need to fix it.

[21:45:26] <jdv> timo: i think i was wrong.  i thought the recent $/ scoping behaviour that liz was working with was the cause of a problem i had
[21:45:40] <jdv> but i think its different
[21:47:42] <jdv> i basically have a hyper map with a few "when ($foo~~//) {$0}" and i had to add a my $/; in the map block.  i don't remember the specific symptom.
[21:49:22] <timo> that could actually have been the same issue
[21:53:39] <jdv> hmm.  that's a quite unfortunate poor composability type deal.
[22:16:09] <lizmat> yes, that's the same issue
[22:16:21] <lizmat> that's exactly the issue
[22:17:12] <lizmat> I've added some documentation for that, which alas is not live yet

[22:20:48] <melezhik> sorry for a little noise ... I have tested my Butterfliable bot )))
[22:21:25] <melezhik> btw can I have a channel to test? probably I can just create a my one?
[22:22:00] <tonyo> just create your own with ##whatever
[22:23:03] <melezhik> sure, already created the one ))) thanks tonyo
[22:26:05] <melezhik> using https://github.com/lizmat/IRC-Client it's just a matter a couple of minutes to create a new bot, cool! cc lizmat
[22:26:33] <lizmat> melezhik: please note that I'm just the current maintainer...
[22:26:48] <melezhik> yeah, I got that ... 
[22:26:53] <lizmat> Zoffix Znet has done 99% of the work on that one
[22:27:06] <melezhik> sure, sure
[22:27:38] <melezhik> I can't thanks him, at least here )) as he won't probably see this, but thanks Zoffix Znet )))
[22:31:37] <lizmat> Zoffix++ indeed

[23:09:12] <Xliff_> tonyo: The failure message is non-sensical. If I rerun the code with just the failed modules. They work. No change.

[23:21:53] <Xliff_> lizmat++ - Great weekly this time 'round.
[23:22:15] <Xliff_> Now if someone could help me with my issues with CURI, I'd really have something to add to it.
[23:22:37] <lizmat> I wish I could  :-(
[23:23:36] <Xliff_> What would it take to add output hooks to CURI that could be exposed via META6.json?
[23:23:52] <Xliff_> Who is the best person to talk to about all issues CURI?
[23:24:01] <lizmat> ugexe nine I'd say
[23:24:06] <Xliff_> Is this something for problem-solving?
[23:24:17] <Xliff_> Both of those I've pinged.
[23:24:28] <lizmat> Xliff_: then it's a difficult one
[23:24:41] <lizmat> wrt output hooks, what are you thinking about?
[23:25:12] <Xliff_> lizmat: All I need is something to keep the user aware that the install process is running. Generally something helpful, rather than fluff.
[23:25:35] <lizmat> try running it with --stagestats ?
[23:25:41] <Xliff_> Also need install strategies for large-scale projects. I don't think a large scale app has been attempted with Raku
[23:25:47] <Xliff_> lizmat: While installing?
[23:26:07] <lizmat> ah... while installing ...
[23:26:08] <lizmat> hmm
[23:26:41] <Xliff_> lizmat: See installation instructions for https://github.com/Xliff/p6-GLib
[23:26:42] <lizmat> it feels more that the install process should have some hooks, that you could activate with parameters to e.g. zef ?
[23:27:22] <lizmat> feels to me that repo needs a README.md  :)
[23:27:25] <Xliff_> Inside META6.json as... as ugexe puts it... this is not a "zef" issue
[23:27:31] <lizmat> what file should I look at ?
[23:27:49] <Xliff_> No. It does NOT need a README.md for the installation issues.
[23:28:10] <lizmat> no, but that could tell me where to find the install instructions :-)
[23:28:26] <Xliff_> Oh. Good point. I haven't written them.
[23:28:29] <Xliff_> One moment.
[23:28:48] <Xliff_> Well. There's a reason for no install instructions.
[23:28:57] <Xliff_> These projects are NOT INSTALLABLE VIA CURI!!!
[23:29:02] <Xliff_> Hence no README.md
[23:29:09] <Xliff_> Which is what I want to fix.
[23:29:20] <Xliff_> You couold try "zef install ." and see how far it gets.\
[23:29:24] <Xliff_> And how long it takes.
[23:29:38] <Xliff_> And how many times you think it's not working coz of no proper output to the user.
[23:29:56] <Xliff_> To locally precompile: "zef install --serial --deps-only .'
[23:30:09] <Xliff_> rr you could run "./install-prereqs.sh"
[23:30:16] <Xliff_> s/rr/or/
[23:30:27] <ugexe> there is an env var to give that output from rakudo
[23:31:04] <Xliff_> RAKUDO_MODULE_DEBUG, right?
[23:31:07] <ugexe> `to install run RAKUDO_LOG_PRECOMP zef install .`
[23:31:13] <Xliff_> I said "something useful" whcih that aint.
[23:31:15] <ugexe> =1
[23:31:24] <Xliff_> s/whcih/which/
[23:31:26] <lizmat> yeah, that's it, but that's developer focused, *not* user focused
[23:32:30] <ugexe> so what exaclty is proper output
[23:32:36] <Xliff_> ugexe: I need something on the order of "Precompiling A::B  ..."
[23:32:49] <Xliff_> Preferbly with a percentage counter on the end of it.

[23:34:10] <Xliff_> If I run that singularly, it compiles just fine, which means it's not an issue with the code.
[23:36:01] <lizmat> Xliff_: is that still happening after today's MoarVM bump ?
[23:36:44] <Xliff_> lizmat: I generally compile on Sundays. I will see.
