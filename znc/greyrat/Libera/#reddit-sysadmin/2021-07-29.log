[05:15:33] <xe0n> Liege waffles are a style of waffle made with a yeast dough rather than a batter like standard American waffles. The yeast dough is mixed with a very coarse sugar called pearl sugar which caramelizes on the outside of the waffle.

[05:54:47] <Jay-Ros> depends how much you're backing up tbh
[05:55:16] <Jay-Ros> it can be used as a proxy, which is 1cpu core per job, and you've got ram allocation
[05:55:41] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> I'm probably not going to have a use for veeam much longer
[05:55:44] <Jay-Ros> then if you're not running 2016 or 2019 with rdma, and you've got on-host storage, you're looking at cpu bandwidth for hdd processing
[05:56:17] <Jay-Ros> the program itself runs as a coordinator for agents, so it really depends on how you're structuring other resources around it
[05:57:18] <Jay-Ros> also if you're chewing on max speeds, your app server will be maxing out on network traffic

[06:53:24] <sd> 13<J​ay-Ros> and you want them both up at the same time, while you're moving them, so they can have two mailboxes?
[06:54:05] <sd> 13<J​ay-Ros> and then you're going to add gibby@twocows.com as an alias to gibby@moo.org once you've done the migrations?
[06:54:16] <xe0n> no
[06:54:23] <xe0n> unless different domain
[06:54:39] <xe0n> if you try to vertify the same domain on another tennant it will complain and say it's already attached to the existing one
[06:55:05] <xe0n> so idea would be to do a staged migration, migwiz can assist with that
[06:55:06] <csws> there is a way but it's really complicated.
[06:55:18] <xe0n> and use the routing address as the source
[06:55:19] <csws> way I did it earlier this year for a demerger was to use connectors and message rewriting
[06:55:27] <xe0n> yeah dont do that
[06:55:42] <csws> it did work but it was just a nightmare to maintain
[06:55:58] <sd> 13<J​ay-Ros> I've done a migwiz migration, it's pretty easy
[06:56:06] <xe0n> the answer is no, plan your migration around having to use the routing addresses until it's go time, then swap them over, do final pass
[06:56:12] <sd> 13<J​ay-Ros> ^
[06:56:26] <csws> worked for like 2 months then something went horribly wrong with the SMTP relay at the new company. we disconnected them from our network and forced them to use their tenant for relaying

[06:56:30] <sd> 02<r​yalln> just merging tenencies
[06:56:34] <csws> then it turned out they didn't have certificate auth setup and they were spoofing us..
[06:56:34] <Work-BWMerlin> Must be email;email (semi-colon between each email not one at the end)
[06:56:36] <csws> it was just a total nightmare
[06:57:01] <csws> yeah you can't really do that ryalin
[06:57:07] <Work-BWMerlin> How do people interpret that line I passed if you were to have multiple email addresses?
[06:57:21] <xe0n> wtf are you even on about Work-BWMerlin
[06:57:23] <xe0n> context..
[06:57:23] <csws> like at a certain point you'll have to cut it over and update the MS=blahblah thing for verification
[06:57:39] <xe0n> thats why you do a staged migration using something like migwiz
[06:57:50] <xe0n> then before the final pass, validate the new domain, enable it, and then do the final pass
[06:57:55] <xe0n> its straight forward process
[06:58:03] <csws> yeah. but there's an inevitable small amount of downtime
[06:58:09] <sd> 02<r​yalln> the thing is i alreday have the same users in everything.

[10:11:45] <CableNinja> man, I had a rough complaint with my boss today...
[10:12:27] <CableNinja> we made a docker container of a special postgres install for a 3rd party software for our customers to use, we also use postgres, so we set the docker postgres port to something other than 5432
[10:12:47] <CableNinja> turns out the piece of shit 3rd party software does not have a way to specify a port, and refuses to even add the ability
[10:13:05] <CableNinja> so you MUST run postgres for this software on 5432, all other dbs be damned
[10:13:34] <CableNinja> I complained to my boss that we should tell the software company to get bent and fix it, and changing our port is a stupid resolution
[10:13:46] <CableNinja> overruled of course

[14:35:12] <regis> And v6 can be NAT'd and can be routed but with routing you'd usually cut any connections incomming from the internet. So there's still the necessity to have a router, it just doesn't have to (but can) do NAT functionality. I personally am NATing with v6 because in some future I can forget about blocking incoming connections, can make mistake in fw configuration or due to other circumstances I could 
[14:35:18] <regis> open the traffic to potentially weak systems. If I'd have tons of traffic however, I'd rethink this strategy.

[16:07:15] <Mark_Pinecone> Can any1 explain best way to migrate linux vm to another vm. I tried with rsync.. system booted, but network doesn't work however config seems correct
[16:08:08] <Hunterkll> configure the new one identically, scp over the data 
[16:08:28] <Hunterkll> there are tools to replicate installed package config of course to make it easy, but that doesn't always work 
[16:08:41] <Hunterkll> but if it's just network, that should be really easy to solve
[16:08:42] <Mark_Pinecone> doesnt scp and rsync doesnt do the same? 
[16:08:43] <sd> 10<n​akade> MACADDR= defined in network config for the old vNIC ? (ie. /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-)
[16:08:45] <Hunterkll> probably a difference in device naming
[16:08:46] <Hunterkll> no
[16:08:48] <Hunterkll> i mean like
[16:08:54] <Hunterkll> just scp over /var/www/stuff
[16:09:02] <Hunterkll> and scp is just like cp but over ssh
[16:09:05] <Hunterkll> rsync synchronizes 
[16:09:11] <Hunterkll> this just copies and/or overwrites
[16:09:24] <Hunterkll> two different purposes
[16:09:25] <csws> tbh I did do something like this ages ago with a VM that was a nightmare to configure
[16:09:30] <csws> migrating it from vultr to my own little ghetto vmware thing
[16:09:40] <Hunterkll> i got one i can't do because it'll be an unbootable insane mess
[16:09:50] <Hunterkll> so i'm slogging through making the package setup identical and moving removed repo packages over and shit
[16:09:51] <Hunterkll> lol
[16:10:07] <csws> Mark_Pinecone, https://lowendbox.com/blog/how-to-migrate-a-hosted-server-in-5-easy-steps-with-rsync/ is this how you did it?
[16:10:07] <Hunterkll> it's paravirt Xen with pygrub and pv kernels, and i'm moving it to a regular VM on a different platform 
[16:10:08] <Hunterkll> fun times 
[16:10:17] <csws> it's not that bad
[16:10:28] <Hunterkll> i mean
[16:10:35] <Hunterkll> if you exclude all the OS specific shit and deal with that later
[16:10:39] <Hunterkll> like they say in that thing
[16:10:40] <Hunterkll> then yea
[16:11:07] <csws> yeah
[16:11:40] <Hunterkll> but i'd install the same distro at same version, patch up the source, install the packages to make the install layout identical, then just copy over the configs and data needed
[16:11:49] <Hunterkll> like the apache config, web dirs, sql DBs/SQL config, etc
[16:12:03] <Hunterkll> rsync like that is a hammer - especially if the distro install has been around for a while
[16:12:09] <csws> this thing was a dovecot/postfix box and it was just... ahhhh
[16:12:12] <Hunterkll> much better to get a clean slate or you end up in the hell i'm in right now with debian
[16:12:13] <Hunterkll> lol
[16:12:22] <csws> nowadays I use mailcow
[16:12:26] <Hunterkll> even if you're just punting it down the road
[16:12:30] <thegodsquirrel> ^^ I spent to much time trying to easy-mode my server migration 
[16:12:57] <thegodsquirrel> Something is always borked
[16:13:13] <Hunterkll> especially if they're using different virt technologies, which you probably encountered here
[16:13:20] <Hunterkll> i'd say mac address and device name are probably the fob for network
[16:13:25] <Hunterkll> and if that's it - you're extremely lucky :)
[16:13:27] <estranger> dovecot and postfix.... what year is it
[16:13:34] <csws> estranger, whenever debian 8 was relevant
[16:13:35] <csws> that's when I did it
[16:13:38] <Hunterkll> lol
[16:13:50] <Hunterkll> i use the fuck outta some sendmail 
[16:13:57] <csws> I left it going for about 2 years then migrated to mailcow as it basically does everything I want.. but better
[16:14:19] <estranger> m4 files .. horraayy
[16:14:22] <csws> the old setup I had an admin panel I wrote myself..
[16:14:23] <csws> it was absolute trash
[16:14:30] <csws> I couldn't even reset passwords without fiddling with the DB lol
[16:14:49] <Mark_Pinecone> I guess that problem is that I did not exclude /etc/network?*
[16:14:51] <thegodsquirrel> mailutils and msmtp ftw
[16:15:00] <csws> Mark_Pinecone, haha yeah probably
[16:15:05] <csws> i'd start over from scratch
[16:15:16] <csws> as in reinstall and rsync again
[16:15:31] <Mark_Pinecone> I'm glad that I made snapshot before ^^
[16:15:35] <Hunterkll> this is such a hacky solution 
[16:15:39] <csws> oh
[16:15:49] <csws> just make sure mark bills the hours to you Hunterkll

[18:10:37] <sintax> crack heads are fun
[18:10:52] <csws> cve, just FYI hetzner is changing their IP address pricing big time so if you have a need for more than a couple of IPs it'll cost $$$
[18:10:55] <oxipital> "i just need some money to get a hotel room..its hot and"
[18:10:58] <csws> they announced it yesterday

[18:12:13] <oxipital> which well
[18:12:19] <oxipital> good on them!
[18:12:24] <cve> that in order to expose and have these machines available to web, I would need to buy static ipv4, right?
[18:12:26] <sintax> i just hate how they want a drivers license, utility bill and first born to "verify" your account. 
[18:12:30] <sd> 03<N​iGHTS> "yes, the price changes are not an april fools thing"

[18:12:51] <csws> cve, hetzner gives you 1 IP which they consider the "main IP"

[18:12:57] <sd> 10<L​iteral_Sperg> Any have a way to limit the memory reserved by the Microsoft Display Driver? Have an Intel NUC on Win10 32bit with an 8GB stick and driver is claiming 6GB and not releasing it. There is no option for setting the max in UEFI. UEFI actually states that max is an OS/Driver setting
[18:13:29] <sintax> pfft 6gb...i had a pc yesterday saying it had 128tb of virtual memory....
[18:13:36] <csws> @Literal_Sperg is there a GPU shared memory option in the BIOS?
[18:13:42] <csws> oh sorry
[18:13:51] <csws> didn't read your whole message
[18:14:20] <sd> 10<L​iteral_Sperg> Ya. Everything says "check the bios" or you find results for "increase shared video memory" FML
[18:14:54] <cve> yeah, I could do some duck tape and put a nginx server on the main IP if I wanted to proxy HTTP requests, but if I would have a db on one server, or multiple static sites in a VM, I would need to grab some ipv4 subnet, right?
[18:14:56] <csws> cve, if you do grab a /29 or something you gotta know how to do L3 routing as hetzner doesn't provide a gateway (they use an IP you nominate as the next hop). if you get additional IPs, they give you a MAC address and you configure a VM with that, DHCP and it "just works"
[18:15:20] <csws> you gotta be real clever with IP usage nowadays

[18:16:32] <oxipital> set by a reg key rather
[18:16:53] <yuken> csws, love you.
[18:16:56] <cve> that's the thing, I'm thinking of hoping my VPSes to a dedicated so I could actually learn how VMs actually work, and how a server actually do what I do using linode, today
[18:17:33] <csws> god.. tbh I don't know much about proxmox but most hypervisors let you create a kind of virtual network. you can then allocate local IPs within that network and use a router to do the NAT
[18:17:44] <csws> the issue is generally the bare minimum requirement is to have 2 IPs for this
[18:17:53] <csws> proxmox might let you be a little more clever since it's debian based
[18:17:59] <csws> but with vmware you're just screwed and need 2 IPs

[18:51:16] <cve> csws: having a decent amount of storage is one
[18:51:28] <csws> lol you need to be more specific
[18:51:41] <cve> at least 1TB 
[18:51:44] <csws> SSD?
[18:51:48] <csws> RAM, CPU?
[18:52:36] <cve> 16GB of RAM, no specifics for CPU, but at least a hexa would be a good starting point
[18:54:03] <csws> I've used these guys and they're alright: https://webnx.com/dedicated-servers/ogden-utah-dedicated-servers/single-cpu-servers/
[18:54:18] <csws> they did have a pretty big disaster recently with a fire
[18:54:28] <csws> but they've probably learned from that lol and they're cheap
[18:54:31] <csws> they also give you a /29
[18:55:58] <cve> nice man
[18:56:38] <csws> https://www.webhostingtalk.com/forumdisplay.php?f=36
[18:56:50] <csws> pretty decent place to find deals
[18:57:25] <cve> holy fuck, it's been a while since I saw an actual forum
[18:57:45] <csws> yeah and I think this is vbulletin too
[18:57:46] <sd> 14<a​b3iter> I sorta miss them
[18:58:02] <dunz0r> I not only sorta, I totally miss them
[18:58:29] <dunz0r> What even happened. Is no one discussing stuff anymore? It can't all have moved to facebook and reddit, because I don't see much discussion there
[18:58:41] <dunz0r> Maybe stack-exchange
[18:58:58] <csws> it's almost like a lot of people who were into forum culture just move don and got lives
[18:59:03] <oxipital> no one really discusses shit
[18:59:04] <csws> *moved on
[18:59:10] <csws> there are still forums around
[18:59:20] <JollyRgrs> discord replaced a lot of need for a community "Forum"
[18:59:24] <sintax> ^^
[18:59:30] <JollyRgrs> for troubleshooting/help forums, they still have a place
[18:59:33] <nobyk> there is no discussion online anymore lol
[18:59:35] <sd> 14<a​b3iter> I think its also that there are just so many facebook/reddit users that forums are buried
[18:59:38] <JollyRgrs> for the bigger issues
[18:59:45] <nobyk> its either, you share my opinion and there's nothing to discuss
[18:59:50] <csws> kiwifarms has a pretty crazy amount of users on it at any given time
[18:59:53] <nobyk> or you don't share my opinion, and you're the enemy
[19:00:18] <sintax> ^^
[19:00:27] <JollyRgrs> case in point https://community.home-assistant.io/ still very active forum here
[19:00:32] <sintax> keyboard warriors. not actual discussion or critical thinking anymore. 
[19:00:40] <csws> WHT is kinda busy but it feels like a lot of oldies running hosting companies talking to each other mixed in with newbies complaining about getting kicked off of hosting companies for spamming
[19:01:03] <csws> man reddit is a nightmare
[19:01:12] <ravioli> reddit is only bad if your subs are bad
[19:01:13] <sintax> reddit is fun with the bots
[19:01:17] <nobyk> Today I was surprised at how well xrdp works out of the box

[19:01:24] <csws> sintax, I hate most of the bots :(
[19:01:30] <sintax> ^^
[19:01:31] <sintax> it's fun
[19:01:44] <sintax> sometimes i get a real person and they wont even have a discussion. just start calling me names. 
[19:01:47] <sintax> it's fun
[19:01:49] <sintax> i just shake my head
[19:01:49] <csws> especially the useless ones that turn posts into haikus or "your sentence is in alphabetical order!"
[19:01:57] <sintax> haha
[19:02:06] <sd> 12<f​elda> as we all know, every topic needs a devil's advocate

[19:02:36] <csws> and I got 12 replies!
[19:02:38] <csws> all of them calling me horrible
[19:02:40] <sintax> I haven't been banned yet anywhere that I know of. I stay mostly civil
[19:03:03] <csws> tbh feels like a race to 0 with my karma

[19:03:15] <csws> lol
[19:03:30] <sintax> csws: for sure. so many people are so against any other view point its wild.

[19:03:37] <ravioli> no
[19:03:37] <sintax> no
[19:03:43] <ravioli> the one being called horrible
[19:03:48] <csws> sintax, corona posting is a sure fire way for me to get nuked in aussie subs as my views are a bit.. out there
[19:03:50] <csws> (by local standards)
[19:03:50] <sintax> I just give an unpopular opinion on some subs and watch the world burn
[19:03:59] <sintax> csws: same haha

[19:04:37] <ravioli> do we have a rule for this yet
[19:04:38] <oxipital> i like how "is it bad or not" is all subjective
[19:04:42] <sintax> we're reliving history

[19:04:55] <csws> *controversial posting ahead*

All you need is an additional unifying receiver to plug in to each machine, and you've got shortcut buttons on the keyboard and mouse to switch between them. For video, you could just get an HDMI matrix switch.
[20:49:38] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> TLSv1.0 is known to be cryptographically inferior to newer versions of TLS such as TLSv1.3 due to the lack of modern encryption standards.
