[01:17:56] <Joanna> Hi everyone what’s new?
[01:34:04] <Joanna> I was listening to a podcast about how the Canadian military sent out fake letters that there are dangerous wolves and then played wolf sounds on loud speakers to test their psychological operations. In other words the public are the enemy and the purpose of the military is to obliterate enemies... I doubt that this is only Canada doing this sort of stuff.

[15:56:45] <joe7057> @Joanna regarding removeing telemetry from win10 it is possible by among other things monitoring all network traffic on a clean windows 10 install and then going through the logs and finding what programs and OS components are sending data out, and then disable those. Rinse and repeat.
[15:57:47] <joe7057> Remember that this stuff has to be technically possible to disable in some versions of windows 10, specifically Enterprise, since many companies and schools don't want telemetry going to microsoft, and they have enough purchasing power together to actually make them do something about it.
[15:58:14] <joe7057> So my guess would be that they used available informations and comparisons between the home/pro versions and the Enterprise versions.
[15:59:15] <joe7057> The thing about win10 ameliorated is that the removal of stuff is a lot more comprehensive than most de-bloaters. The entire start menu is replaced, as well as I believe the file explorer. MS Edge, Windows Update, and a ton more is just not there.

[17:23:19] <Joanna> I’ve never tried to egress block something.
[17:23:39] <Joanna> How much effort is involved?
[17:24:47] <Joanna> I’m surprised that the software doesn’t stop working entirely if you don’t update it...
[17:25:26] *** Joins: pyfisch (~pyfisch@user/pyfisch)
[17:25:55] <_flood> just enable firewall and set outbound for block and only allow what you  need
[17:26:08] <_flood> safest way and you actually have the control on the host side rather than relying on egress networking firewall
[17:27:15] <Joanna> But can’t the windows on your machine detect that it can’t update?
[17:27:22] <_flood> yes
[17:27:39] <_flood> it will complain that it can't reach out to update/patch
[17:27:54] <_flood> that is the flip side, it won't have any communication outside of your control but you lose out on malware/os patches
[17:29:04] <Joanna> I wonder how much it will complain about not being able to update
[17:29:31] <_flood> not really a lot
[17:29:37] <_flood> been running  a bunch of vms like this for years
[17:29:49] <_flood> albeit they are not patched untill i let it
[17:29:53] <_flood> or push patches manually
[17:30:01] <_flood> OS is still completely functional
[17:30:37] <_flood> will check in later, let me know how it goes :)
[17:31:05] <Joanna> Why use win 10 ? I prefer win 7 that allows more control.

[19:40:57] <jan6> 16:02 <Joanna> Do you know if there is a way to control which update version happens on mobile devices like phones?
[19:41:12] <jan6> you need unlocked bootloader in order to downgrade the OS, usually
[19:43:21] <jan6> if you're sane enough, you'd check that the phone is unlockable before purchase, anyway, else you're stuck with current and future versions they push to you, depending on the phone, and severity, sometimes they can even force-update (usually only for "serious vulnerability", not sure if all of them, but at least the more custom ones like apple/samsung/huawei/xiaomi probably can)
[19:47:11] <jan6> unlocked bootloader would allow you to flash anything (usually also voiding warranty, and with a disclaimer that "from now on everything is your responsibility, including ensuring the mobile radio corresponds to local regulations, etc"), locked one you can't directly flash, but you can usually flash through the existing "recovery mode", which only allows images signed by the manifacturer, and I'm
[19:47:12] <jan6> pretty sure often only allows upgrades + existing version, but not downgrades
[19:49:55] <jan6> there's almost always "full system" sets available, for unlocked bootloaders, and usually also versions usable by the builtin recovery, depending on the phone/manifacturer, there might be an update tool, or you might just need to scavenge it from their website, or from internet (and assume it's untampered, which they usually are)
[19:52:54] <jan6> e.g. I got a motorola phone lately, specifically because they make it easy to unlock bootloader (e.g. huawei shut their unlock page down, a while ago, sadly), and using "resource and smart assistant" (aka "LMSA") on windows, lets me easily download any updated OS image in full, either for archiving, or for stuff like patching with magisk, so I can have root
[19:53:51] <jan6> they also have a couple images available through web interface, but not the most up to date ones, or anything, at least not for my phone
