[00:02:29] <Guest41> I guess I am confused what is meant by fixed point though

[00:02:58] <somiaj> x
[00:03:26] <qergle> yes, evalues are ±2i
[00:03:42] <qergle> (from charpoly x^2+4)
[00:03:45] <somiaj> Guest41: are you sure they use the language fixed point? I'm use to x' = 0 and y' = 0 being a way to find equilibirum points.
[00:04:44] <somiaj> Though I guess 'fixed point' could also be valid, since they are constant solutions which don't change or are fixed, but fixed point usually means something else
[00:04:46] <Guest41> here it is in 1d https://i.imgur.com/S7Md5Zh.png
[00:04:52] <cads> ppw, Perhaps our derivative operator is only ever defined for continuous functions, so if a function is k times continuously differentiable, we can deduce that its k-1th derivative had to be continuous, else it would not have been differentiable
[00:05:24] <qergle> Guest41: if eigenvalues are all complex and the real parts are all 0, then you have a circulation around the fixed point
[00:05:35] <qergle> neither source nor sink
[00:05:56] <somiaj> Guest41: yea, equilibrium solutions is a bit more common vocabulary (in my experience) for that.
[00:06:17] <Guest41> qergle yeah thats what the text says too, but what *is* the fixed point here?
[00:06:33] <Guest41> is it (x*, y*) = (0,0) ?
[00:06:43] <somiaj> and as qergle pointed out the point in your problem is an orbit/center, some places call them stable vs asympotically stable.
[00:06:53] <Guest41> so we have a center or spiral at (0,0) ?
[00:06:56] <somiaj> Guest41: yes, x' = 0 and y' = 0 is one way to find them.
[00:07:01] <Guest41> one way?
[00:07:26] <somiaj> not a spiral since the real part of the eigenvalue is zero
[00:07:40] <somiaj> Guest41: yes, there are often multiple ways to do things, though in this context, that is probably the way you want to use.
[00:08:10] <Guest41> ah is that one of the conditions? real part zero -> not spiral and so therefore center
[00:08:13] <Guest41> must have missed that
[00:08:27] <somiaj> They are usually defined to be constant solutions, but derivatives of constants are zero, so solving x' = 0 and y' = 0 is often the easiest way to find these constant solutions.
[00:08:35] <qergle> real part > 0, source (spiral out), real part < 0, sink (spiral in)

[00:08:45] <Guest41> why does real part being zero mean no spiral?
[00:09:08] <somiaj> recall the solutions look like e^(real_part t) * ( A cos(im_part t) + B sin(im_part t) )
[00:09:30] <somiaj> the sines/cosines cause the looping/circular behavior, so the imangary part describes this
[00:09:56] <somiaj> the real part describes if the 'radius' grows or decays expontially, and if it is zero, there is no change
[00:10:29] <Guest41> ooooh
[00:10:41] <Guest41> thank you grand math wizard somiaj and qergle

[00:16:12] <somiaj> various hits in google, maybe more common than I thought, even wolfram mentions it as one of the possible definitions of fixed point, though I do see why many books call it equilibrium solutions to avoid confusion with fixed points in other contexts.

[01:01:27] <Guest9334> somiaj same person from before. What would it mean for our solution to have an eigenvector which is zero?
[01:01:52] <Guest9334> I have x' = 2y, y' = x and get lambda1 = sqrt(2) and lambda2 = -sqrt(2)
[01:02:04] <Guest9334> for the first eigenvalue, I get an eigenvector which is 0
[01:06:51] <somiaj> Guest9334: eigenvectors cannot be zero
[01:07:05] <Guest9334> i see an error in my work
[01:07:12] <somiaj> by definition an eigenvector is a non-zero vector such that Ax = lambda x
[01:07:20] <somiaj> now eigenvalues can be zero, but that is a different problem
[01:07:53] <Guest9334> the first eigenvector second component is a free variable. Do I just let it be 1?
[01:08:12] <somiaj> that is often the best choice
[01:08:34] <Guest9334> so then v1 = [sqrt(2), 1]
[01:08:39] <Guest9334> okay nevermind this is fine
[01:08:59] <somiaj> recall there are always an infinite number of eigenvectors for any eigenvalue, but for this context, we only need a single one (we get the infinite number when we multiply by c1 and c2)
[01:09:28] <Guest9334> yee
[01:09:31] <somiaj> in this case you could have chosen zero, and gotten [sqrt(2); 0] if the bottom variable is truely free
[01:09:51] <Guest9334> sure
[01:09:56] <Guest9334> waitwut
[01:10:00] <somiaj> so 0 and 1 are nice choices for free variables depending on what the other value has to be
[01:11:14] <Z-module> somiaj's remark does not apply if the scalar field is F_2 and the eigenspace is 1-dimensional, but that's a quite unusual case.

[01:15:35] <Z-module> constxd_: I don't remember much about diff.eqs., but I would have thought the general solution to the original  y'' + 81y = sec^2(9x) = c_1 cos(9x) + c_2 sin(9x) + u(x)   where u(x) is some particular solution.

[01:29:56] <somiaj> constxd_: Though your problem is a nice example of an affine space, I think the theory behind that is nice, actually computing the solutions, not so nice, but sometimes one needs example problems to better understand the nice theory behind linear differential equations.

[01:40:36] <Guest9334> somiaj is more about confusion regarding definition. The book says that the FP is called "attracting" if trajectories near it eventually converge to that point. Similarly, called "Liapunov stable" if the trajectory is guaranteed to always stay NEAR the fixed point (e.g, a center trajectory). So, what is a saddle point?

[02:23:23] <isekaijin> On an unrelated matter, I have this intuition that a domain R being a UFD means that, in a sense, the singularities in Spec(R) are not too large - they have at least codimension 2. Therefore, they do not get in the way of the formation of divisors.
[02:23:50] <noobly46> In this case, the limit is simply 'x', right? so you mean to use this value 'x' in my proof?
[02:24:13] <isekaijin> Is the reverse implication true? If R is a domain such that Spec(R)'s singularities are “not too small”, can I conclude that R is a UFD?

[06:05:23] <euouae> I don't understand why my computer can calculate N in seconds (by picking the factors p,q) but can not calculate a divisor of N...
[06:05:48] <euouae> quotient* of N
[06:06:01] <somiaj> factoring is just hard, there is no efficient algorithim
[06:06:21] <somiaj> basically you just have to divide by every prime less than sqrt(N), which for large enough N, is a very very large number of primes.
[06:06:29] <dude12312414> the fastest algorithm is the general number field sieve, which is subexponential but still more than polynomial time
[06:06:56] <somiaj> well the sieve just finds primes, you still have to divide N by each of them to determine one of its factors
[06:07:12] <somiaj> or am I missing something?
[06:07:28] <dude12312414> no that's not that kind of sieve
[06:07:35] <dude12312414> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_number_field_sieve
[06:08:02] <dude12312414> (fastest known factorization algorithm, i meant)
[06:08:31] <somiaj> ahh I guess there is faster than just trying them all, didn't realize that.
[06:08:38] <dude12312414> yeah
[06:08:44] <dude12312414> that one is fairly complicated though
[06:08:46] <euouae> how is trying them all exponential?
[06:09:01] <dude12312414> there are simpler ones that are still better than O(sqrt(n))
[06:09:21] <euouae> if my computer can compute p and q, doesn't it mean they belong to some computable table? Can't a supercomputer with the table break it really fast?
[06:09:22] <dude12312414> they are based on finding congruences x^2 = y^2 (mod n)
[06:09:45] <somiaj> here it is more that if N is big enough, just the number of tests takes a long time.
[06:09:49] <euouae> I guess somehow the production of p and q is easy...
[06:09:59] <somiaj> sure, multiplication is easy, factorization is not
[06:10:46] <euouae> how large is N usually? I'm trying to get a sense of the size
[06:10:52] <somiaj> for instance you may have trouble factoring 2359127 by hand, but you could probably do 1523*1549 by hand (if slow and detailed)
[06:11:21] <somiaj> You can make it as large as you need, but 2048 or 4096 bits is common
[06:11:22] *** Joins: blueberrycrop (~blueberry@209.222.164.236)
[06:11:48] <euouae> the sqrt of 2359127 is 1535 so I would be trying the same numbers, only a larger divisor?
[06:12:15] <euouae> I guess somehow the cost of division is important too, right?
[06:12:19] <somiaj> yea one simple algorithim is just try to divide beteen all numbers between 1 and 1535, though you could say start in the middle
[06:13:03] <euouae> oh but if I were to factor 1523*1549 I'd only have try for numbers <= 100
[06:13:07] <somiaj> the cost is there, but the biggest cost is the number of things you have to check (assuming we are just using this standard method, as dude12312414 mentioned, there are some faster methods, but they don't improve the speed enough to make it cost effective)
[06:13:44] <somiaj> yea my example I picked two prime numbers that were close together, probably a bad example, since if someone started at sqrt(N) and worked down they would find factors fairly quickly
[06:13:56] <euouae> how is a 4096 number picked as N? Or is it "padded" with 0s?
[06:14:19] <somiaj> so better to pick prime numbers that are orders of magnitude different to ensure the factors are not near the sqrt(N)
[06:14:28] <euouae> Will a 4090-bit number will do?
[06:14:52] <blueberrycrop> 1111 / 200
[06:14:55] <euouae> Really? Wiki claims the opposite somiaj "and should be similar in magnitude but differ in length by a few digits to make factoring "
[06:15:13] <euouae> -> make factoring harder
[06:15:48] <somiaj> open ssh defaults ot 3072 bits now and considers it sufficent, but as computers get faster, this number goes up
[06:16:32] <euouae> I guess I'm wondering, since 4096 refers to the size of N, does it mean the leading bit is always 1?
[06:16:42] <euouae> e.g. N > 2^4095 ? no, right?
[06:16:43] <somiaj> euouae: maybe you need both, you could have similar magnitude, but still have a large difference so the factors aren't close to the sqrt(N) to make starting there and working down inefficent.

[07:27:33] <cuppajoeman> but that kinda seems horrifying to do since that's notation
[07:27:51] <int-e> Well, the connection between  f(g(x))' = f'(g(x)) g'(x)  and  df/dx = df/dg dg/dx  is a matter of convention, I think.
[07:28:22] <cuppajoeman> Ok, I'm interested on how you can "treat" g(x) as a variable

[07:28:54] <int-e> cuppajoeman: Well, the notation is rather suggestive, but you have to realize that the justification for this kind of cancellation is the chain rule.

[07:35:22] <cuppajoeman> I think my confusing is coming from the notation df/dx I'm going to re-read using the f' notation
[07:35:43] <PlanckWalk> If f is a differentiable function, then f' is just its derivative
[07:35:58] <qergle> it's ugly notation maybe this is why
[07:36:08] <PlanckWalk> There's no "treating g(x) as a variable" involved
[07:36:46] <PlanckWalk> f' is a function, and f'(g(x)) is the value of that function at g(x).
[07:36:57] <PlanckWalk> Just like every other use of function notation.
[07:37:02] <cuppajoeman> Ok, f'(x) = lim h-> 0 (f(x+h) - f(x)) / h
[07:37:15] <cuppajoeman> That's the definition right
[07:37:54] <PlanckWalk> Yes, for functions with real or complex domain
[07:38:36] <cuppajoeman> Ok, so then (fog)' (x) = f'(g(x)) * g'(x) is talking about this limits
[07:38:56] <PlanckWalk> Yes
[07:39:22] <cuppajoeman> Ok, so if I define f(x) = (x + 3)^2 and g being some aribtrary function from R -> R
[07:39:56] <qergle> dcal{L}/dw = ∂𝓛/∂y * dy/dz * ∂z/∂w
[07:40:08] <qergle> d𝓛/dw = ∂𝓛/∂y * dy/dz * ∂z/∂w
[07:40:10] <qergle> better
[07:40:21] <cuppajoeman> ok, I will come to that once I understand single variable)
[07:41:02] <qergle> cal{L}=f(y,t), y=σ(z), z=g(w,x,b)
[07:41:05] <qergle> 𝓛=f(y,t), y=σ(z), z=g(w,x,b)
[07:41:18] <cuppajoeman> Can we do an example with single variable?
[07:42:06] <cuppajoeman> Ok, what about f(x) = x^2 and g(x) = x + 3
[07:42:09] <int-e> for the chain rule? no? you inherently have two variables in f(g(x)), namely x, and the unnamed argument of f.
[07:42:29] <int-e> giving them the same name isn't all that helpful.
[07:42:30] <cuppajoeman> (I mean 1-D case)
[07:42:42] <qergle> they thing you posted is inconsistent in its use of "d" vs "∂"
[07:42:46] <int-e> it means you don't know what df/dx is anymore
[07:42:49] <qergle> also they left out parts of the chain
[07:43:00] * int-e shrugs
[07:43:00] <qergle> see my "d𝓛/dw = ∂𝓛/∂y * dy/dz * ∂z/∂w" vs theirs.
[07:43:05] <cuppajoeman> ok
[07:43:14] <cuppajoeman> int-e what do you mean?
[07:43:43] <int-e> qergle: they kind of splot the chain, dL/dz is computed separately...
[07:44:00] <int-e> (which is confusing)
[07:44:21] <int-e> and I don't trust them nor myself to get the distinction betwenn ∂ and d correct :-/
[07:44:24] <qergle> oh yes, i see
[07:44:30] <int-e> s/splot/split/
[07:44:35] <qergle> right, i think that adds to the confusion, in this case.
[07:45:41] <int-e> I guess the point is that a big part of the computation can be shared between dL/dw and dL/db
[07:45:49] <int-e> But... meh.
[07:47:18] <cuppajoeman> Ok, I'm reading your stuff qergle: So L = f(sigma(g(w, x, b)), t)
[07:47:24] <qergle> it's understandable that cuppajoeman is not enjoying the handwaving when the handwaving is a bit sloppy on notation and also unecessarily convoluted
[07:48:17] <cuppajoeman> So this is the composition of 3 functions
[07:48:20] <qergle> cuppajoeman: yes, you could write it like that
[07:48:40] <qergle> then lagrange's notation would fall right out and you could reverse engineer leibniz to confirm.
[07:48:47] <cuppajoeman> But we can consider sigma(g(w, x, b)) as (sigma o g) (w, x, b)
[07:49:24] <cuppajoeman> So then by the chain rule we have that L' = f'( (sigma o g) (w, x, b) ) * (sigma o g)' (w, x, b) right?

[07:51:59] <cuppajoeman> I agree now
[07:52:05] <cuppajoeman> Yes
[07:52:21] <cuppajoeman> Ok, so now I need to understand the multivariable chain rule right?
[07:52:27] <qergle> right
[07:52:41] <PlanckWalk> Yes.  It's easy with some linear algebra though, and looks almost identical.
[07:53:27] <qergle> but i think organizing it this way, has already made you advance a lot mentally, wrt understanding what the notation is meant to capture.
[07:54:11] <int-e> Note that dL/dy is the derivative of PlanckWalk's f wrt its first argument.
[07:54:28] <int-e> Not a derivative of the fully expanded four argument version of L.
[07:56:10] <cuppajoeman> The definition of f is f(a, b) = (1/2) ( a - b)^2 right?
[07:56:21] <int-e> yes
[07:57:01] <PlanckWalk> Yes, you could alternatively name  ∂L/∂y  as  f'_1  or something (first component of the derivative of f)

[07:59:05] <PlanckWalk> It's still (g o f)'(x) = f'(g(x)) * g'(x),  but the product is in general a matrix product.
[07:59:12] <PlanckWalk> Err, f o g

[08:00:35] <cuppajoeman> Let's say I want to compute part. L/ part. w
[08:01:07] <cuppajoeman> In that case can I use the normal chain rule because I am treating all other varaibles as "frozen" constants?
[08:01:13] <PlanckWalk> I.e. the first component of L' (since you defined to be the first parameter)
[08:01:18] <PlanckWalk> defiend w to be
[08:02:30] <PlanckWalk> If you're only interested in one component, you can check where that component comes from in the matrix multiplication.
[08:02:39] <PlanckWalk> And simplify to just those terms.
[08:03:35] <cuppajoeman> It would be a row from the first matrix dotted with a column from the second? https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/oaTKINCb/image.png
[08:06:13] <PlanckWalk> Yes.  In your case, I think L just takes values in R?

[08:07:24] <int-e> The composite of two linear maps is the matrix product if they're represented as matrices.

[14:11:45] <Z-module> cadmio, it's supposed to be self-explanatory. The l ranges through positive integers. Say p is 2 and the number (from top or bottom) is 24, then 2^3 is the power of p occurring in 24's prime factorization, meaning that p^l divides 24 for l = 1,2,3 but no higher l.

[14:17:32] <qergle> the next non-trivial one, is the fraction (3*2^2-2)/(2^2-2). here you have l=1 (the highest power of 2 that divides 10). so it must also be the highest power that divides that the denominator 4. that therefore you're left with no 2, they canceled
[14:18:15] <qergle> to conclude, for each fraction, p^l is the highest power that divides the numerator (which must be also the highest power that divides the denominator), leaving the fraction without any p's.
[14:19:58] <qergle> they don't make l be maximal in their exposition but it is free to be maximal so applies to whatever turns out to be maximal. which makes it ugly.
[14:21:44] <qergle> there are actually elegant ways to prove that C(mp^n,p^n) = m (mod p)
[14:22:07] <qergle> which is a stronger result than merely C(mp^n,p^n) ≠ 0 (mod p)
[14:23:28] <cadmio> there's also another proof my text shows but I want to understand that first
[14:23:55] <qergle> ok, i would re-write this proof you're doing to make p^l be maximal.
[14:24:48] <qergle> or not, who knows, do you understand what that chain of iffs is doing?
[14:25:10] <qergle> if p^l divides the top it must divide the bottom, and vice versa.
[14:25:30] <qergle> so you never have a p left over
[14:26:24] <cadmio> if p divides a term in the numerator, then it divides the corresponding term in the denominator

[14:41:05] <Franciman> you can prove that the complex structures on the torus are all and only of the form C/(aZ + ibZ)

[14:51:46] <Z-module> cadmio, not sure if you'd find it helpful, but you could rewrite the equation to use only integers, no fractions:  (p^n)(p^n -1)...(1) |S| = (mp^n)(mp^n - 1)...(mp^n - p^n)      And now see that for each k = 1,2,...,p^n, the kth factor on the left has the same power of p dividing it that the kth power on the right has, so with these two integers (producdts) being equal, that leaves no possible power of to divide |S|.  Because prime
[14:51:46] <Z-module> factorization is unique.
[14:52:26] <Z-module> sorry, last fraction on the right should be (mp^n - p^n + 1)
[14:53:12] <Z-module> last factor, rather. Same number of factors on both sides, with just the extra factor of |S| on the left
[14:53:23] <cadmio> I'm not sure why other proof refer to p and not p^l, e.g. lemma 3.6 http://math.uchicago.edu/~may/REU2016/REUPapers/Idelhaj.pdf

[14:56:45] <Z-module> In Lemma 3.6 ? It literally does have p^l in there.
[14:56:50] <Z-module> read it.
[14:57:30] <Z-module> It's the exact same proof, in fact.
[14:57:34] <Z-module> just formatted differently
[14:57:54] <cadmio>  "we wish to prove that if p divides a term p^n*m−k in the numerator, then it divides the corresponding term p^n−k in the denominator."
[14:58:30] <Z-module> that's exactly what we were discussing here, a half-hour ago
[14:59:07] <Z-module> well, we discussed all the powers p^l that divide the things, in particular the highest one that divides it
[14:59:09] <Z-module> them*
[14:59:15] <Z-module> that same thing is here in 3.6
[14:59:44] <Z-module>   k = p^l q   is k's prime factorization into a power of p (p^l) times other stuff (q) not involving p
[15:00:15] <qergle> they should have said p^l
[15:00:44] <cadmio> yes it's wrong just p
[15:00:51] <Z-module> essentially they're only focusing on the factors that have ANY positive power of p invovled as factors, skipping the others
[15:01:06] <Z-module> your earlier thing does that too, inherently in the "iff" part
[15:02:06] <Z-module> the other one said   p^l | (mp^n - i)  iff   p^l | (p^n - i)    iff  p^l | i       There are many (in fact most) cases when all three cases are false.
[15:02:27] <Z-module> The point is that the same exact highest-possible power, p^l, works for all three
[15:02:58] <Z-module> so all powers of p in the giant producdt of fractions mutually cancel.

[17:53:10] <sobobobobo> hi, if we define a set A = {f \in C(0,1): f(t) = 1 t \in [0,1/2]} and i want to show that set A has infinitely many norm minimizing functions. Could i  argue without loss of generality that for example f(t) = 1 if t \in [0,1/2] otherwise 1+t*n where n is a natural number
[17:54:13] <sobobobobo> this proves the claim since set of natural numbers is infinite

[21:54:52] <riv> isnt' this related to elliptic functions

[21:55:07] <Franciman> C/(aZ + ibZ)
[21:55:11] <Franciman> so there infinitely many
[21:55:18] <riv> but they can all be expressed in terms of two
[21:55:20] <Franciman> and they are in 1:1 correspondence with elliptic functions

[21:59:02] <cherim> Yes. Did you mean \cup instead od \cap?

[21:59:44] <noobly> Z-module, thanks, forgot about 0. but why [2,4], isn't that already included in E? that answer is equivalent to '([5,7] n {0}) n E', right?
[22:00:16] <Z-module> no, E itself only has the rationals in [2,4], not all of [2,4] in R  which is my unstated ambient space
[22:00:32] <noobly> Z-module, ah I see
[22:01:03] <joel135> I am reading a little about homological algebra (Gelfand and Manin). Is anyone here familiar with torsion and stuff like that? When you look at the cohomology of a sheaf of abelian groups, it is said that the cohomology in dimension 0 will be given by the global sections of the sheaf. I wonder what role non-global sections (like ones that don't extend to global sections) will play?
[22:01:12] <noobly> cherim: I'm afraid I don't understand, the closure of E involves the intersection of these other sets
[22:01:27] <cherim> There is some mess going on
[22:01:42] <Galois> non-global sections are reflected in higher cohomology right
[22:01:44] <cherim> Let me first ask Z-module what the interior is
[22:01:54] <joel135> I was guessing they may have something to do with torsion.
[22:02:11] <Z-module> each 1/n  (n in N) is also in the interior E^o, because for each 1/m there, the set {1/m} = E cap (1/(m + 1), 1/(m - 1/2))
[22:02:54] <joel135> Galois: that is nice to hear since otherwise they would be sort of ignored, which would have been a shame
[22:02:59] <cherim> You want to say 1/2 is contained in E together with some its neighborhood in R?
[22:03:35] <joel135> I hope to understand this eventually.

[22:06:27] <Galois> it's easier to understand (for example) regular cohomology on topological spaces before you dive into sheaves
[22:07:19] <Galois> like S^1 (a unit circle) has nontrivial first [co]homology precisely because it doesn't have global sections, and if you try anyway to wrap a global section around it you get the universal cover, an infinite spiral
[22:09:49] <joel135> Do you think the old book by Cartan and Eilenberg is good for understanding regular cohomology, or do I need to go deeper into history?
[22:11:17] <noobly> so in my case, cl(E^o) would be cl(E) \ [2,4] - right?
[22:11:27] <noobly> think im getting the hang of it if so
[22:12:03] <cherim> OK, let's just go from where we stopped. E^o is correct. \bar E isn't

[22:15:38] <Z-module> noobly: in your new post, for \bar{E} ,  you have the right set, but just note the fact that [5,6] cup [6,7] = [5,7]   for a notational shortcut.
[22:16:24] <noobly> Z-module yes, thanks, I just left it as is so whoever grades it might follow easier
[22:16:33] <Z-module> yes cherim
[22:17:03] <Z-module> oh wait, yeah, I messed up,  E^o  has none of the 1/n points
[22:17:54] <joel135> Ah right, that book...
[22:18:00] <cherim> I am out, take over from here
[22:18:47] <Z-module> noobly, so yeah, E^o is only (5,6) cup (6,7)
[22:18:57] <Z-module> so the closure of that is [5,7]
[22:19:04] <noobly> Z-module, cool, that's what I was thinking initially as well. and it then follows that cl(E^o) is just {0} u [5,7] ?
[22:19:16] <Z-module> sorry I misled you

[23:35:28] <greenbagels> the maximum order of an alement of S5 is 6, right
[23:35:53] <qergle> what do you think?
[23:36:21] <greenbagels> about the S5 question or abotu whatever you just said
[23:36:56] <qergle> about S_5
[23:37:21] <riv> |S_5| = 5! = 5*4*3*2
[23:37:32] <qergle> yes, there are elements order 6 in S_5 and that's maximal.
[23:37:44] <isekaijin> Also, I forget if it was the Indians or the Chinese who had Pascal's triangle several centuries earlier.
[23:37:50] <riv> I would have thought you could get elements of order 5*3*2

[23:39:47] <qergle> what are possible cycle structures?
[23:40:59] <greenbagels> qergle: so my thought was that it has to be an element of the form (a b c) (d e)
[23:41:13] <greenbagels> because every element of S5 can be written as the product of disjoint cycles where the sum of cycle lengths is 5
[23:41:31] <greenbagels> so we're just maximizing a*b where a+b=5

[23:43:07] <riv> i guess we can find subgroups of order 5*3*2, but not elements
[23:43:42] <qergle> cycle structure looks ok, continue with argumentation
[23:44:19] *** Joins: freeemint (~freemint@2001:638:904:ffe8:2abf:c8f8:8aa3:41d7)
[23:44:42] <greenbagels> right so (a b c) has order 3, (d e) has order 2, but they are coprime so their product has order 6 (since they are also disjoint, so they commute)
[23:45:13] <greenbagels> but any other disjoint cycle decomposition has a lesser or equal order
[23:45:22] <qergle> yes, (**)(***) is the structure
[23:45:56] <greenbagels> this was a GRE problem, i thought it was pretty nice since i was always bad at group theory

[23:50:33] <greenbagels> subgroups of size 5*3*2... hm
[23:51:01] <cuppajoeman> For the first table, I want to say that no matter how many formulas you generate, (using OR and Negation), You'll always be eqv to one of ~A & A, A, ~A, ~A V A
[23:51:21] <cuppajoeman> For example A V A V A V A ~ A
[23:51:21] <qergle> hint: not yes
[23:51:34] <riv> cuppajoeman: count how many functions there are from 2^n -> 2
[23:51:44] <riv> that's how many possible boolean expressions you can make with n variables
[23:51:49] *** Joins: avoidr (~avoidr@user/avoidr)
[23:52:38] <cuppajoeman> 2^n represents the value of each propositional varaible (either true or false), and 2 represents the truth value of the whole expression?
[23:52:57] <riv> 2^n is the values of the variables
[23:53:01] <cuppajoeman> Yeah
[23:53:14] <riv> e.g. X AND Y  is a function from (X,Y) --> T or F
[23:53:53] <qergle> gre makes me think bagels wants to become dr bagels.
[23:54:55] <cuppajoeman> riv: not sure I follow
[23:55:03] <cuppajoeman> I agree with what you've said though
[23:55:47] <greenbagels> qergle: :) too bad i decided a bit late to take it heh
[23:55:56] <greenbagels> i both dont have enough time to brush up on things and don't have a guaranteed seat
[23:56:08] <cherim> enbagels then
[23:56:10] <qergle> never too late, it's rolling basis. if not ets not make billions for fat cats.
[23:56:15] <cuppajoeman> To answer your question though: for each input there are two options as to what it gets mapped to, and there are 2^n input elements so 2 * 2 * ... * 2 (2^n times)
[23:56:19] <greenbagels> ah i meant the math subject test
[23:56:21] <cuppajoeman> So 2^(2^n)
[23:56:22] <greenbagels> which they do like 3x a year
[23:56:41] <greenbagels> im sure the general gre has like basic precalc on it or something
[23:56:54] <qergle> none is too taxing
[23:56:57] <riv> cuppajoeman: what don't you follow? X AND Y as a function is simple right?
[23:57:06] <riv> or X OR (NOT Y) could be another function
[23:57:12] <cuppajoeman> Idk how this corresponds to my question
[23:57:23] <greenbagels> cherim: enbagels?
[23:57:25] <riv> but they are all functions from {T,F} x {T,F} -> {T,F}
[23:57:26] <cuppajoeman> My question, is that I want to construct a a formula that it's equivalent to
[23:57:38] <riv> you can construct a formula for any boolean function using deltas
[23:57:48] <riv> just OR them together
[23:57:59] <greenbagels> qergle | hint: not yes <--- was this to the "are there subgroups of size 5*3*2" question?
[23:58:06] <qergle> yes
[23:58:09] <riv> a delta is a formula that is true only in one case, e.g. delta for T,F,F could be  X AND (NOT Y) AND (NOT Z)
[23:58:21] <cuppajoeman> Let's say I have two propositional varaibles
[23:58:26] <cherim> Oh, I thought "<qergle> gre makes me think bagels wants to become dr bagels" was parsing gre-enbagels
