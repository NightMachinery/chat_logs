[00:21:23] <birkoff> like if there is no padding?
[00:21:45] <piou> I don't understand that question
[00:22:58] <piou> But anyway, many ciphers use a block size that is a multiple of 64 and stream ciphers can get to such multiples by accident, and that's without considering later padding
[00:24:26] <birkoff> that's one way
[00:24:28] <piou> If you have no information and notice that the cipher length is a multiple of say 256 then sure working under the assumption that it's a 256-bit block cipher is reasonnable, but it's not going to be always correct (far from it) and even if it is true it doesn't provide much information as there are dozens of ciphers using such a block size
[00:25:18] <birkoff> if padding is not applied to a cbc then it may appear as a stream cipher
[00:25:36] <piou> no
[00:25:56] <piou> a block cipher works on a block of definite size
[00:26:03] <piou> you cannot "not use padding" for a block cipher
[00:26:40] <piou> a 128 bit cipher such as AES will take 128 bits, not one less, not one more, and produce a 128 bit encrypted block
[00:27:36] <piou> if you have 127 bits either you pad that block or you don't encrypt it, but there's no middle ground here
[00:28:13] <piou> When I said "later padding" I meant padding happening after the encryption step, for example due to constraints in the overall protocol.
[00:30:34] <piou> Also, "padding applied to a cbc" doesn't mean anything, cbc is a mode, padding happens on a block for a cipher, you're mixing apples with sheeps

[00:42:01] <ytrezq> argon2 is not cross plateform.
[00:42:29] <ytrezq> and then are you sure 2) compute argon2(R), 3) truncate if necessary
[00:42:31] <CoderGuy> If you have an api, and said api contains values that given you put in the proper values will make internal calls, and your goal of security is to prevent internal calls, why would you put in your api any way to do this?
[00:43:06] <ytrezq> doesn’t allow so simplify the case instead of requiring to compute it in a non naïve way ?

[08:09:26] <Hasbri> Hypothetically if I had a Wi-Fi router/access point and set it to bridge mode only to passthrough to a separate router (like Pfsense) would there be the same risks with vulnerabilities in the potentially non-updated firmware of the access point using this mode compared to if I used it in router mode?
[08:09:31] <Hasbri> In that, over time such an access point would become outdated even if it's a current model at the time of purchase so wondered if vulnerabilites affect the same way it in bridge mode (such as remote admin bypasses I sometimes read about, etc). This is assuming of course the admin creds are changed from default.
[08:10:20] <ajak> lol
[08:10:46] <ajak> probably depends on the vulnerability?
[08:12:25] <Hasbri> So regardless of what the router is an AP can potentially still be a weak link in the security of a network if there's a particular vulnerability in the firmware?
[08:13:51] <Hasbri> In that case it seems like I'd be better off rolling an AP into the router via PCIe to avoid outdated firmware but I don't see many do this.

[13:18:43] <mats1> the proxmark line of hardware is popular for use in rfid research
[13:19:19] <circuitbone> I had an infrared dongle that could change lots of tvs at once for my smart phone, poor guy nearly sold it to me defective in the store. on / off / on / off
[13:20:23] <mats1> whats unfortunate is that most people don't shield their rfid stuff, and sometimes that stuff is keyed uniquely, so if its used for auth and there's no cctv around, a passerby with equipment can get people in trouble after unauthorised authorised entry
[13:21:59] <mats1> this is also why fingerprints are annoying and inappropriate for auth, because... people fucking leave em everywhere
[13:22:21] <godSend23> auth = authentication?
[13:22:50] <mats1> not to mention, fingerprints aren't unique, and can't be changed, which makes them especially useful for frame up jobs
[13:22:58] <mats1> yes
[13:23:42] <mats1> anyway, the keysy thing will work on some set of rfid dongles, so if this kinda problem concerns you, try it out
[13:24:13] <godSend23> ok, and what does "keyed uniquely" mean?
[13:25:23] <mats1> theres a big old table in a db somewhere, your dongle has an id, and emits a unique bitted response when challenged

[16:18:49] <electr0n> mats1: in my defense, I read it not....
[16:18:58] <Apachez> otherwise you would need to have some sort of challenge/response like "run sha256 with 100.000 rounds using this as text to hash"

[17:13:45] <soulisson> also afaik, depending on the memory dump, you might want a computer with plenty of memory. I didn't happen to me but I know that some people where unable to do analysis because not enough memory

[20:40:38] <piou> Oh it's been arround for a while. If you want evidence, pentesting was the topic of the movie Sneakers (1992). It took a while to become popular though.
[20:43:46] <piou> It's just that, just because a legal frame exists to do things properly doesn't mean people will act within that frame. People are still arrested and sued today when they're not operating with a proper contract or bug bounty agreement. That's not something you often sort out after the fact.

[20:58:46] <programmar> ferhan: also "internet safety" is a bit vague to test btw, but if you are surfing web, just consider the green lockpad ;)
[20:58:48] <piou> ferhan: yeah, you just walked on my message. What do you mean by internet safety?
[20:58:59] <programmar> piou: alright then, thk for the info
[21:00:09] <ferhan> Sorry, i think its about system safety not internet safety i was using the wrong word
[21:00:37] <programmar> ferhan: did you checksum the iso of Ubuntu which you used to burn and install ? that is like the first ever step
[21:00:40] <ferhan> thank you for the green lockpad
[21:01:14] <ferhan> I used a usb iso, i don checked but i can do
[21:01:41] <programmar> but just keep your system up-to-dated in case some there are new updates on patches and vulns, other than that case, just don't run command that you don't understand, whether it's privileged commands or not
[21:02:06] <programmar> ferhan: yea, maybe you are ok, but next time, do the checksum properly, it's a good practice and also first step to ensure your iso file is secured and no one has tampered with it
[21:03:20] <ferhan> programmar: ok, but i want to learn some of them, no i will try with checksum, but i have no idea about uefi
[21:03:31] *** Joins: horsepatat (~horsepata@80.89.73.99)

[21:06:04] <ferhan> There is always another way?
[21:06:33] <programmar> becuz when someone tampers with your system or they hijack your system, you will hardly know where they locate their malicious files, you can do a bit recursive look if you want or monitor each process and look out for suspicious processes then trace it back, but that is a lot of work
[21:06:51] <piou> Not really, if it's been compromised you have to reinstalll

[21:07:38] <flyback> "nothing to see here, only criminals have to fear our tools, etc"
[21:08:08] <ferhan> Ok, which tool is the best systemscanner for maleware?
[21:08:18] <flyback> lzip -d -v -v -v -v -k *.lz
[21:08:31] <flyback> started uncompressing all the images I made of old hard drives
[21:08:43] <flyback> since I moving the files to zfs which has it's own transparent compression

[21:08:48] <ajak> ferhan: what do you currently use?
[21:08:51] <piou> ferhan: you seem to have a very specific case in mind. Why don't you tell us the full story? That's the best way to have good advice.
[21:08:54] <programmar> ferhan, well that is more of a Windows question, as far as i knwo Linux hardly have any anti-virus which functions the way you see on Windows
[21:09:05] <flyback> my project is almost at the point where I have actual backups made
[21:09:21] <flyback> I like avast for a av
[21:09:34] <flyback> malware bytes and rogue killer for system scanners
[21:09:36] <ajak> programmar: active scanning for malware is not a windows question
[21:09:42] <flyback> I used to use combofix but that doesn't support win10+
[21:09:59] <flyback> but you still need to offline scan if you suspect rootkits etc
[21:09:59] <programmar> ajak: yea but base on how he asks, he seems to want a real-time alert prompt
[21:10:08] <flyback> meaning boot a clean os off some media
[21:10:14] <flyback> mount the windows partition and scan it
[21:10:24] <ajak> let's not assume what they mean :p
[21:10:36] <programmar> flyback: also kaspersky is great tho, only a bit costly
[21:10:43] <flyback> kaparksy rescue is what I used to use, but now I use hbcd + kaparsky virus remover tool
[21:10:44] <programmar> nya, it's very costly :P
[21:11:13] <flyback> I wrote a batch file to make a directory on the hard drive, copy kaparsky virus removal tool to there and set the temp and tmp variables to there

[21:12:54] <ferhan> Im on ubuntu, i build once a gentoo its 14 years ago and dont have any thoughts about it
[21:13:15] <programmar> ok, what does that have to do with systemscanner ?
[21:13:25] <flyback> I also highly recommend freenas as a cheap way to have network backup storage to protect against ransomware (assuming you setup the network storage so that the clients and ransomware have only acess to the latest files so they can only corrupt the last backup not the ones before. easy to do with some kind of timer script after so many days, move files to a directory not network shared etc
[21:13:37] <flyback> I have 2 gentoo systems
[21:13:44] <flyback> I don't care for all the extra work you have to do
[21:13:57] <flyback> but I needed custom kernels for my data recovery boxes
[21:14:15] <flyback> for one of the two pci-ide cards, I run the old linux ide drivers that let you turn off dma
[21:14:24] <flyback> for doing data recovery
[21:14:25] <programmar> flyback: wonder if it also backups the ransomware :P
[21:14:34] <flyback> programmar, it could
[21:15:14] <programmar> I could potentially turn that ransomware into a worm if multiple are connecting to the same backup storage tho :P but yea, i will try
[21:15:20] <programmar> in some needs for backup right now
[21:15:33] <flyback> they just removed that old ide/mfm/rll code from linux 5.14 so I have to put a peg in gentoo to NOT upgrade to 5.14 or newer
[21:15:36] <flyback> and stay with a old kernel
[21:15:55] <flyback> programmar, I don't see how if it's not running the same os as what you are backing up

[21:16:56] <flyback> programmar, I never said that
[21:17:32] <ajak> why wouldn't ransomware exist on linux yet?
[21:17:37] <flyback> I didn't setup gentoo as well as I could and there were a lot of crashes till I got the hardware resolved so probaby some flipped bits
[21:17:56] <flyback> I also want to start with btrfs from the begining so every file is protected against corruption
