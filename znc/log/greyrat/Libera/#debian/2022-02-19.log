[13:50:14] <personx_> sury
[13:50:44] <personx_> Mathisen, yes, the Sury PHP repo
[13:50:53] <personx_> to install older php. [7.2]
[13:51:14] <Mathisen> yeah ok
[13:52:26] <Mathisen> not sure then. sury usaly works fine to use
[13:52:42] <Mathisen> i dont use it myself anymore so i cant speak for it now
[13:53:26] <Mathisen> in any case you cant realy solve it in a easy way if the repo dont provide libcurl3

[13:54:14] <Mathisen> backports maybe ? not sure
[13:55:52] <personx_> i think I've already messed up quite a bit [still being a noob, not sure what i did] with backports using wget and dpkg. this is what i did - "wget "ftp.us.debian.org/debian/pool/main/c/curl/libcurl3-gnutls_7.74.0-1.2~bpo10+1_amd64.deb" then "sudo dpkg -i libcurl3-gnutls_7.74.0-1.2~bpo10+1_amd64.deb"
[13:57:47] <Mathisen> and how did that go ?
[13:58:13] <personx_> Mathisen, yoo, did I do what I think I did? xD did I install an even newer version instead of an older version? xD yeah that didn't work, same error as before.
[13:58:35] <Mathisen> and you did run sudo apt-install -f install after that
[13:58:45] <personx_> um, nope
[13:59:29] <personx_> didn't say anywhere to run that particular command. shall I do that now?
[13:59:44] <Mathisen> that will fix broken dependencis if there is any
[13:59:55] <Mathisen> i just assume libcurl3 would need deps also
[14:00:17] <Mathisen> but you will just break your system if you keep downloading random dep packages and installing em
[14:00:27] <Mathisen> just try to solve it with just the regular repo + sury
[14:00:36] <personx_> umm, 'apt-install install -f' not found. did you mean 'apt install -f'
[14:00:36] <personx_> ?
[14:01:14] <Mathisen> sudo apt-get -f install
[14:01:21] <Mathisen> heh to early for me
[14:01:55] <personx_> okay all set. but same problem.

[14:02:40] <personx_> so anyhow - libcurl 7.52.1-5+deb9u10 this is the one I should install as backport for libcurl3 support, yes?

[14:04:43] <personx_> I want it for php7.2, not php7.3 [but yeah i suppose the problem is the same]
[14:04:58] <Mathisen> yes the problem is the same
[14:05:52] <personx_> okay so I should just change my apt/source sury from buster to stretch?
[14:05:57] *** Joins: i0e (~is0ke3@user/is0ke3)
[14:06:28] <Mathisen> it seems like he does that yes. but indeed it sounds strange to use a buster + a stretch repo
[14:06:42] <personx_> okay, nope, that doesnt help
[14:08:31] <personx_> shall i try "wget "security.debian.org/debian-security/pool/updates/main/c/curl/curl_7.52.1-5+deb9u16_amd64.deb""?
[14:08:44] <personx_> umm, with http ofcourse xD
[14:08:50] <Mathisen> nah
[14:09:10] <Mathisen> what you should do i installing debian 9 if you realy need 7.2
[14:09:26] <Mathisen> i did some reading and you wont be able to solve this
[14:09:41] <Mathisen> libcurl4 is the only thing you will get in debian 10
[14:09:48] <Mathisen> and that means php 7.3...
[14:10:19] <budlight> downgrade back to 7.2

[14:19:38] <Khepra> !downgrade
[14:19:38] <dpkg> Downgrading is not, nor will ever be supported by apt.  Programs change their data in a way that can't be rolled back, and package maintainer scripts support upgrades to new config file formats but not downgrades.  Try: "dpkg -i olderversion.deb" or "aptitude install package=version" using "apt-cache policy package" to get the old version number.  See also <partial downgrade>, <unstable->testing>, <sdo>.

[14:29:05] <personx_> Mathisen, Khepra I need to use php7.2 because that's the higest an open-source CRM/helpdesk software I want to use supports. And I was suggested to use debian to run on my VPS for rock-solid stability. I was obviously going to go with debian bullseye and php8. but it seems that's not an option for me?
[14:29:24] <personx_> budlight, yoo, how do I force a version in deb buster?
[14:29:28] <Khepra> personx_: 7.2 is long dead, there's no support for it unless you pay for the freexian support tiers

[14:33:18] <Khepra> personx_: 7.2 is not packaged for debian, never was. there's no downgrade option for it. sury's packages are EOL'd and no longer supported either. if you need 7.2, then: https://php.freexian.com/
[14:34:25] <personx_> Khepra, oh and that's not the main purpose of this vps. Its going to be a mailserver for the company. we're shifting to google suite. so that's why I was suggested to use debian bulleyes as my OS for stability.
[14:34:38] <budlight> lowest i can go is 7.4 from 8.1
[14:34:49] <personx_> Anyway I could install php7.2 with libcurl3 on bullseye?
[14:34:51] <Khepra> personx_: if you need stability then forget anything outside of regularly packaged software.
[14:35:07] <Khepra> personx_: not if you want stability.
[14:35:46] <Khepra> again, if you really need 7.2 and it sounds like you need it for a business, then you'll have no problem paying up for proper 7.2 support on bullseye.

[14:36:57] <personx_> could I install php8 [latest] from proper channels on bullseye and use that as the default for serving apache. but also install php7.2 for just this one specific domain/directory?
[14:37:55] <Khepra> personx_: if you want stability, do not deviate from packaged and tested versions. to use php8 you have to test your applications thoroughly because it breaks backwards compatibility and applications need to be made php8-ready.

[16:24:48] <uovobw> hello *, i noticed what i think is a bug in the default redis-server configuration in current debian. the `supervised` flag is set to `no` but the service is running under systemd, that means that for _large_ datasets (we are loading a ~750 GB dataset in memory) the systemd service times out. is there a place i can find more info on the decisions that went into the default config file? is it worth
[16:24:50] <uovobw> opening a bug or would it become noise? tia.
[16:25:07] *** Joins: i0e (~is0ke3@user/is0ke3)
[16:25:57] <Khepra> uovobw: systemd units are just generalized defaults. you're expected to tweak your system according to its needs. this includes increasing any service timeouts or reconfiguring entirely for different approach on large, hoggy datasets
[16:27:07] *** Joins: cyrix (~orangeext@user/orangeextract)
[16:28:13] <uovobw> Khepra: that makes sense. i thought that since the default init system is noW systemd and the redis-server is basically going to run under that by default it would make sense for redis to be configured to be systemd-aware. i have tweaked my configuration and it's now working (changing the redis config, not the systemd file), so i guess i wont open a bug. cheers.

[16:29:21] <Khepra> uovobw: seems like redis-server comes only with an init script? if so, you can always write your own service unit. it will be used if both are found by systemd. otherwise, systemd sysv init wrapper is used

[16:30:42] <Khepra> that said, some of services in debian are just terribly configured. it's made worse that some maintainers want to retain sysv compatibility so the default config does not take advantage of all the facilities and security of systemd.
[16:32:21] <uovobw> Khepra: i installed from package and there is indeed a systemd service, under /etc/systemd/system/redis.service
[16:32:57] <Khepra> uovobw: that's just a symlink into /lib/systemd/system/    yes?
[16:34:28] <Khepra> I see it's in the package, but I couldn't find it in the sources, dunno how it's created then
[16:34:39] *** Joins: mtn (~mtn@98.97.127.52)
[16:36:44] <Khepra> oh found it, it's dynamically configured at build time
[16:37:19] <uovobw> Khepra: yes, it's a symlink. i have now set the `supervised` to systemd in the redis.conf and added the TimeoutSec=infinity to the systemd file. that means that upgrades are going to be a pain but what can you do
[16:37:47] <Khepra> uovobw: you can do the right thing and override the /lib/systemd/ one with a proper file in /etc/systemd/system/
[16:38:13] <Khepra> never alter /lib/ files. systemd provides the whole framework and path priorities for overriding vendor units
[16:39:26] <Khepra> (and that won't mess your upgrades)
[16:40:58] <uovobw> Khepra: ah! i have edited the /etc/ file, but you are telling me that this file is going to override the distro file in /lib? that means that i can ansible-deploy my /etc/ file that will overlway my configs over the standard diStro ones that come from /lib? that would be great news!

[16:42:59] <Khepra> the other, the one I prefer, is full override of the entire file. for example, just replace that symlink with an unit of your own. you can copy from /lib/ and then tweak as you wish.

[19:28:31] <dob1> I still have to start, I was thinking what I need for this
[19:28:45] <Khepra> yes, is there dovecot on the server with doveadm capabilities? you can use doveadm to sync dirs and I _think_ invoke sieve scripts, which can then easily be programmed to shuffle delivery wherever you want by whatever supported criteria

[19:32:19] <dob1> no
[19:33:01] <Khepra> then I don't know what you can use. worst case, a bruteforce attempt would be to grep maildirs for mails with attachment mime headers, and then cp them to whever you want
[19:33:44] <Khepra> grep -l to identify such files, then simply cp. force dovecot reindex, best with doveadm, but I suppose you can nuke the dovecot* files in maildirs and hope for the best :)
[19:34:13] <Khepra> I mean I know you can, just make sure no imap or pop3 process is accessing the maildirs while you do it

[19:35:51] <dob1> I think I was not clear because it seems different from what I was thinking
[19:36:09] <Khepra> dob1: but if you can coerce your provider... maybe they can give you access to doveadm or do it for you. with doveadm you can directly fetch from remote imaps and that goes through sieve

[19:37:34] <dob1> my idea was: a cron script that in some way fetch email from the provider and delete them, if any of the email are from a specific domaim and has attachment save the the attachment in a specific dir

[20:54:39] <somiaj> Khepra: If the maintainer is willing to keep a package in debian it isn't just dropped because of a dead upstream (though sometimes is). Though, if there are known rc bugs with the software, it should be dropped (do you know of any rc bugs?)
[20:56:08] <somiaj> https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=925056 -- that seems to suggest some people are using it in production and are willing to put the work to keep it in debian.

[21:09:21] <antto> the package gods don't know whether you're using apt or synaptic, do they?

[21:11:07] <somiaj> though really they all use dpkg to do the actually installing of packages. apt/synaptic are just a means to get remote packages and their dependencies
[21:11:30] <somiaj> I don't keep up on synamptic but sometimes its logic differs from apt, which also differes a bit from aptitude on complicated requests
[21:13:04] <antto> i'm just hoping they are aware that at least some folks use synaptic and like it and it doesn't get.. forgotten ;P~
