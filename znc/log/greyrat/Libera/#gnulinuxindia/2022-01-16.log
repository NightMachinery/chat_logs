[12:32:59] <Hemishhehim[m]> but there is one problem, i have created a functionality to show valid textile files in a folder and list them, but relative paths are not working goodly, they fail sometimes
[12:33:48] <Hemishhehim[m]> anyone here who doesnt even know textile, can still see the code, because textile conversion to html only works in one line by calling a function provided by textile python library
