[00:04:34] <thurstylark> senoraraton: the libretro-nestopia package installs a core for libretro to use. the most common user interface for libretro is retroarch.
[00:05:06] <thurstylark> so start retroarch, and you should have access to the nestopia core within retroarch
[00:05:09] <senoraraton> There were zero man pages, and no info on the repo, and no comments to actually explain this.
[00:05:11] <noze> senoraraton: generally to find the executables installed by a package you can look at `pacman -Ql (some package) | grep /bin`

[00:08:10] <senoraraton> Nestopia is an NES emulator that I have used before.  I found the nestopia package, and it didn't work, so I then installed the libretro-nestopia package from the repo because it wasn't AUR, and was trying to figure out how to run it.

[04:26:46] <lpv[m]> Guys on an old laptop with 2 gpu's how do I get to change between the gpu's? I mean I can change from BIOS for example between discreet which uses the nvidia and switchable which uses intel igpu. And I have a working xorg.conf for each but I have to switch to tty after xorg/i3/lightdm breaks, copy the right config and restart the service. Do you know of some tool I can use for that? At best I'd also like to now have to switch to discreet to use
[04:26:46] <lpv[m]> the nvidia but given it's 10+ years old I don't care much
[04:27:05] <MrElendig> depends on the exact model
[04:27:31] <lpv[m]> oh
[04:27:48] <MrElendig> some of the pre-optimus laptops were still switchable at runtime

[04:28:49] <MrElendig> other than that, you could keep switching in the bios and then simply make two different boot entries in your boot loader
[04:28:55] <lpv[m]> I remember this one doing that on windows 7 years ago but I don't know much about software here
[04:29:27] <lpv[m]> boot entry for different config?
[04:29:30] <MrElendig> with two different initrd
[04:29:35] <MrElendig> yes
[04:30:09] <MrElendig> with modesetting enabled/disabled as needed, and then at boot a script that checks the command line and swaps out the xorg config if needed

[04:34:19] <lpv[m]> sorry one more question, isn't the nvidia also supposed to be able to run somehow when on switchable mode? I mean there must be a way to run on discreet instead of igpu, cause as of know I'm always on igpu when switchable on bios

[09:01:38] <chipps> Hi guys I have a problem. I have an arch vps, and I have setup a znc server on that machine, and its listening on port 6698. Problem is, I can't go to the ip address http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:6698 on my local machine. However, I can access http://localhost:6698 when I am ssh'd into my server. What is happening?
[09:02:27] <kj7rrv> It's probably listening on localhost or 127.0.0.1, and it needs to be listening on 0.0.0.0 for that to work

[11:46:28] <alloy> kib, shows that what you want *is* possible though, just seems the chromium people can't/won't do it
[11:46:30] <Technoturnovers> trust me, firefox is no slower than chromium
[11:46:34] <grawity> X11 has a "session management" protocol that e.g. xsm and gnome-session used to provide, to tell Firefox nicely that it should prepare for logout/shutdown
[11:47:00] <gulzar> Technoturnovers: FF works better than Chrom* in my case. I had 1050 tabs opened :)
[11:47:06] <alloy> I find with 5 windows and 100 tabs open *all* browsers blow chunks
[11:47:13] <alloy> (so I try not to)
[11:47:14] <kib> just a bit of clarification, poweroff and shutdown are  the same command right?
[11:47:15] <grawity> a few years ago, "I logged out from dwm and firefox thinks it crashed" was a common thing
[11:47:24] <grawity> kib: they're not
[11:47:28] <kib> :O
[11:47:47] <grawity> but they'll eventually invoke the same shutdown via systemd
[11:48:10] <kib> is it better to use one over the other?
[11:48:33] <grawity> halt/reboot/poweroff are slightly more direct, shutdown is like an extra interface over those 3 if you want a timed shutdown, or if you're rebooting a multi-user system it'll `wall` all users
[11:48:47] <grawity> otherwise the result of `poweroff` vs `shutdown -P` is the same
[11:48:49] <tomty89> grawity: I suppose who uses s(tart)x does/can not benefit from this session management thing?
[11:48:50] <kib> hmm now that all my passwords are on bitwarden, i might move to ff....
[11:48:59] <grawity> tomty89: well, it has nothing to do with that
[11:49:16] <kib> grawity: oh i see, but they both use the same systemd command right?
[11:49:24] <grawity> kib: indirectly but yes
[11:49:36] <tomty89> grawity: hmm, but how the de/wm shut things down?
[11:49:37] <grawity> tomty89: it's more about whether startx is told to *run* a session manager, or whether it just does some `exec fartwm`
[11:49:44] <alloy> kib, mozilla has been the best browser since... the web! (imho)
[11:50:06] <Technoturnovers> the purpose of shutdown is to confuse new users who expect their computer to shut down now
[11:50:13] <grawity> tomty89: e.g. in GNOME, the topmost process isn't the WM, it's gnome-session, so all "logout" requests go through gnome-session – which does the XSMP thing, closes apps nicely, then invokes systemd's reboot
[11:50:49] <alloy> I'd use fartwm
[11:50:53] <lunario> hi, so i have a question on package management. i noticed that there are several commands starting with "purple" in my shell available, e.g. purple-send, purple-client-example and 2 others. I think they are related to pidgin, which I had once installed but don't have installed anymore. my question now is - how can I find out what the name is of the package they belong to? i tried e.g. pacman -Rc
[11:50:55] <lunario> purple-send but the package was not found.
[11:51:08] <grawity> pacman -Qo /usr/bin/purple-send
[11:51:52] <grawity> tomty89: a bare WM could in theory do all that stuff by itself as well, it's just that most WMs consider it "bloat"

[21:19:53] <tirnanog> as well as user-agent based caching, chromium and derivatives may ignore /etc/hosts.

[21:20:42] <perrierjouet> I am on this tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KA6A3oeocHY
[21:20:50] <tirnanog> iirc, firefox should respect /etc/hosts but I haven't tried it in a while. anyway, if you want to do this at the dns level, it's definitely more reliable to have a local resolver and to point resolv.conf to it than to use /etc/hosts.

[21:43:02] <tirnanog> dns blocking is more useful if you're trying to perform filtering at a rather coarse level for a number of hosts.
[21:44:04] <tirnanog> anyway, resolv.conf is a file for controlling the behaviour of glibc's resolver, not for mapping names to addresses.
