[01:39:55] <bookworm> why would you print a console msg? People are expected to read docs and that includes the comments in the config file
[01:40:25] <bookworm> and considering that sqlite is in fact still an optional dep that seems ill advised
[01:41:26] <kinghat> there was a console warning of a config property that was depreciated. dont remember which one.
[01:41:48] <bookworm> sure, but it isn't deprecated 
[01:41:51] <kinghat> i read the docs and didnt know why it was like that by default ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
[01:41:57] <bookworm> it still works as designed 
[01:42:49] <kinghat> and maybe a decision needs to be made on going with sqlite only as default. rather than writing to two places.
[01:43:06] <bookworm> both have merits 
[01:43:21] <bookworm> you don't have to use both so just choose 
[01:43:37] <kinghat> they do, but not both by default.

[01:44:11] <bookworm> depends on your level of data hoarding 
[01:44:24] <kinghat> most people arent grepping logs, and since search is here and utilizes sqlite, should it be the only default?
[01:44:35] <bookworm> I keep text logs, I purge the db every once in a while 
[01:44:45] <bookworm> why?
[01:45:04] <kinghat> im not saying get rid of txt logging, just not on by default. for sure not both as default.
[01:45:08] <bookworm> some people don't have working sqlite3, happens often 
[01:45:26] <bookworm> so the choice is no logs at all or text

[15:18:44] <bookworm> no idea, why are you asking the Arch person in the room ;P ?
[15:18:47] <butaxorgh> I think it errors on the config file but I assume I have to create it first?
[15:19:02] <bookworm> nah, the config comes from the package
[15:19:07] <butaxorgh> I dont know bookworm. its a question from a non *nix person :D
[15:19:07] <bookworm> what's the error?
[15:19:11] <butaxorgh> sec
[15:19:35] <butaxorgh> https://pastebin.com/8zY5HDa0
[15:19:37] <butaxorgh> this
[15:19:53] <butaxorgh> may ne it has to do with the node.js? I had some trouble setting it up properly
[15:19:55] <butaxorgh> its ubuntu...
[15:20:14] <butaxorgh> ne=be
[15:20:22] <bookworm> how did you start TL?
[15:21:06] <butaxorgh> sudo apt install ./thelounge.deb [except I had to put in the 'thelounge_4.3.0_all.deb' instead of the thelounge.deb
[15:21:26] <bookworm> start, not install 
[15:21:33] <butaxorgh> may be the line "The Lounge is now up and running in private mode at http://localhost:9000." confused me and I thought it will be up and running after I installed it?
[15:21:34] <butaxorgh> wrong?
[15:21:40] <butaxorgh> then I guess I hvnt started it :D
[15:21:47] <butaxorgh> damn...
[15:21:58] <bookworm> Then how did you get the error message you just pasted?
[15:22:23] <butaxorgh> it was a return for 'thelounge --help'
[15:22:30] <butaxorgh> what Cienisty suggested
[15:23:05] <bookworm> what's the output of `sudo systemctl status thelounge` ?
[15:23:11] <butaxorgh> sec
[15:23:16] <Cienisty> sudo thelounge --help
[15:23:40] <bookworm> also, `namei -mo /etc/thelounge/config.js`
[15:23:50] <bookworm> and ignore Cienisty 
[15:24:17] <bookworm> -mov actually rather than -mo
[15:25:13] <butaxorgh> https://pastebin.com/k3mx6tKJ
[15:25:25] <butaxorgh> does this mean it runis using node.js 14.?
[15:26:11] <bookworm> yes
[15:26:17] <butaxorgh> damn it
[15:26:23] <bookworm> damn it?
[15:26:40] <butaxorgh> I thoiught I set 17th to be the one used by default, so something went wrong at that stage too
[15:26:43] <butaxorgh> ok let me namei -mov /etc/thelounge/config.js
[15:27:32] <butaxorgh> I did want to get arch up but that provider didnt have it... so I went with ubuntu
[15:27:40] <bookworm> that's just to check the perms, but considering the status output that should be fine
[15:28:00] <butaxorgh> https://pastebin.com/D3Mxm4Ux
[15:28:34] <bookworm> did you mess with the perms?
[15:29:10] <bookworm> o= for it seems a bit restrictive considering that nothing secret is in there
[15:29:32] <butaxorgh> hm I don't think I did anything like that on purpose
[15:29:46] <butaxorgh> was just trying to follow the instructions from the site
[15:29:52] <butaxorgh> is it all fkdup
[15:29:53] <butaxorgh> ?
[15:30:28] <bookworm> hm? No
[15:30:50] <bookworm> it's all fine but that's why you got the error in your tl --help invocation 
[15:30:57] <butaxorgh> ok. I mean I didnt do anything else really. I did get stuck on the node.js stage, since ubuntu had an ancient version 
[15:31:17] <butaxorgh> so you mean there are some permissions that are too strict for thelounge?
[15:31:42] <bookworm> well, not if you run it as the proper user or set the env var
[15:33:18] <bookworm> TL essentially wants you to use the system user, called "thelounge" whenever you interact with it by default if you install the OS package
[15:33:36] <bookworm> meaning if you want to execute a TL releated command, use `sudo -u thelounge thelounge $whatever`
[15:33:50] <bookworm> the first thelounge is the username, the second the name of the binary
[15:35:18] <butaxorgh> I was following instructions from here: https://thelounge.chat/docs/install-and-upgrade#debian-and-ubuntu-based-distributions and all I did was installing/updating node.js and then installing thelounge
[15:39:32] <butaxorgh> so I need to shut it down now and run from thelounge user? thelounge user was created upon install?
[15:39:41] <butaxorgh> from/as
[15:40:43] <bookworm> no, the system service takes care of the user and all
[15:40:46] <butaxorgh> and seperate question regarding node.js - if I installed thelounge with not the latest node.js version is it possible to reassign nodejs version or it requiers reinstalling thelounge with recent nodejs version?
[15:40:50] <butaxorgh> hm ok
[15:40:50] <bookworm> you only need to care when you add users
[15:40:55] <butaxorgh> ah
[15:41:26] <bookworm> as for node, that's resolved at runtime via the first "node" binary in your path. It has nothing to do with the installation per se
[15:42:00] <bookworm> generally, you can only have a single node installed at the os level (at least linking to /usr/bin/node)
[15:42:09] <butaxorgh> ok so I should just be able to change te version? I have the latest one installed but had trouble with making ubuntu consider the latest one as default
[15:42:40] <butaxorgh> yeah I insatlled nvm because I couldnt just update nodejs as is... it was 12 I think
[15:42:40] <bookworm> well, sure. Multiple options. But for that you should head to #linux, there's nothing TL specific there
[15:42:49] <bookworm> nvm doesn't actually work well
[15:42:59] <butaxorgh> I see...
[15:43:10] <bookworm> that's more for your own user, not so much the system installation
[15:43:13] <butaxorgh> using thelounge with 14 verion is not a good idea?
[15:43:29] <bookworm> really, the only thing that should manage system installation level binaries is your package manager, apt / dpkg in your case
[15:43:44] <bookworm> as long as you are >12 you're good
[15:44:00] <bookworm> >= 12 actually
[15:44:02] <butaxorgh> ok, at least nodejs is ok
[15:44:08] <butaxorgh> thanks!
[15:44:09] <bookworm> that's also hard enforced, so don't worry if TL runs
[15:44:28] <butaxorgh> I think it was 8 actually
[15:44:35] <butaxorgh> hence why I had to update nodejs
[15:45:25] <butaxorgh> so its not running currently, right?
[15:45:38] <butaxorgh> I need to edit config file before running it too
[15:45:42] <butaxorgh> according to the instructions
[15:46:07] <butaxorgh> I mean, thelounge isnt running

[21:18:03] <bookworm> either is fine
