[13:21:33] <mouses> right but the color code is broken
[13:22:36] <mouses> TL can't set proper color codes, and there is no human way to do it
[13:23:10] <bookworm> sure it can
[13:23:18] <mouses> view my screncap https://lounge.mouses.xyz/uploads/882f2d8948ba3d20/image.png and copy/paste the text and try to color it the same way
[13:23:23] <bookworm> https://labrat.space/irc/c9568367aafb8e8f/Tl.jpeg 
[13:23:29] <mouses> that's not
[13:23:36] <bookworm> that's not what?
[13:23:49] <bookworm> that's black background and red foreground, exactly what I told it to do
[13:24:51] <bookworm> all TL does is sent those codes https://modern.ircdocs.horse/formatting.html#colors
[13:24:59] <bookworm> it also interprets the same
[13:25:12] <mouses> how would you send {{title}} {{duration}} {{channel_title}} {{published}} {{view_count}} views {%if timestamp%} @ {{timestamp}} {% endif %};
[13:25:25] <mouses> yup, all color stripped

[13:27:46] <bookworm> don't see your problem really
[13:27:57] <mouses> how did you do that within the client?
[13:28:21] <bookworm> C-k, pick color, write a comma (as documented in the help), pick color
[13:28:28] <mouses> oh god
[13:28:51] <mouses> that's not good :(
[13:29:04] <bookworm> not good how?
[13:29:29] <mouses> so a field with 25 colors codes, I have c-k, pick a random color, backspace once to add a xx,yy code?
[13:29:55] <bookworm> no backspace
[13:30:13] <mouses> it's like I have to hit control K and klude things and stuff vs sane control
[13:30:26] <bookworm> how did you expect it to work? You shouldn't be coloring a message that rainbow-y in the first place
[13:30:41] <bookworm> that's a thing a bot does, not a human
