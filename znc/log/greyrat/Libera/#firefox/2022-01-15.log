[12:53:57] <UPXTcgv7> It appears to be working similar to before like with music sites working.  When I click on the Help button, then About Firefox, the colors jumble for what looks like a quick second.  Games crashed before the update, but I have not tested that now.

[20:25:33] <dalias> ede, no, mobile just lacks it entirely afaik :/
[20:26:20] <ede> dalias: addons? argh. but i'd still check the headers :)
[20:26:42] <ede> does the mobile version have the network tab?
[20:27:06] <dalias> it's for all sites. it's not "the headers"
[20:27:25] <ede> does it work with a local pdf?
[20:27:27] <dalias> no
[20:27:38] <ede> uh. so no pdf.js? uh.
[20:27:42] <dalias> right
[20:28:06] <dalias> i was just asking why. this is a widely known issue, one of the many many gratuitously stupid things on the mobile version :/
[20:28:24] <ede> tbh i had to look into a pdf these days, i wish i would have downloaded it for a local client, but sometimes it's just convenient.
[20:29:02] <ede> everyone uses mobile, everyone else develops for mobile, still both hardware and software suck after all the years.
[20:29:55] <dalias> yep
[20:30:10] <dalias> sometimes i want to keep a pdf if it's a manual or something
[20:30:19] <dalias> but usually it's just information that should have been a web page
[20:30:29] <dalias> or even should have been an email
[20:30:54] <dalias> (literally, i get emails that are just a link to a messaging-service site that are just a pdf attachment, arrrrggg!)
[20:31:14] <dalias> (when the content should have just been in the email body)
[20:31:57] <ede> yep. it was a calendar with some big tables of due dates, fine for HTML, but they prefer to have a 1:1 copy of the printed version. including all that useless background images.
[20:32:16] <ede> oh, the web also sucks. i think i didn'ŧ mention it today yet.
[20:32:23] <dalias> yep
[20:32:36] <dalias> it would suck just a little less if firefox would just display the pdf tho..
[20:32:44] <ede> heh yeah
[20:33:00] <dalias> rather than having to download it, open in pdf app, then remember to delete it so it's not filling up my storage
[20:33:31] <ede> what about https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/android-pdf-js/
[20:33:44] <ede> even warns me that it's not available for my platform
[20:33:53] <dalias> trying
[20:34:46] <dalias> not compatible with modern mobile firefox that banned all but a tiny whitelist of addons...
[20:35:04] <ede> ARGH
[20:35:04] <dalias> in theory there should be a way to hack it in editing the profile directory
[20:35:29] <dalias> on my old phone i was still using 18-mo-old firefox to avoid all the regressions
[20:36:12] <dalias> but on my new one i installed fennec from f-droid (at least it's slightly less bad than the play store one -- about:config isn't gone)
[20:36:15] <ede> i gave up long ago keeping track with the versions
[20:36:18] <dalias> but it's still BAD
[20:36:26] <dalias> i might have to just switch to nightly :(
[20:36:41] <ede> microsoft did it with patch tuesday, mozilla didn't learn the lesson
[20:36:44] <dalias> which is the only one still not treating the user like an idiot
[20:37:07] <dalias> guess i can try it
[20:37:12] <dalias> if it works i might migrate my profile to it
[20:37:27] <ede> better keep a copy
[20:38:13] <dalias> well it doesn't replace fennec
[20:38:25] <dalias> because android, they're all different app names/signatures
[20:38:28] <dalias> and can't share data
[20:38:44] <dalias> to migrate i'll have to adb shell in and rm -rf the new profile dir, copy the old one
[20:38:57] <dalias> all so stupid
[20:39:56] <dalias> someone should make an index of nightly versions corresponding to releases
[20:40:04] <dalias> then you could just grab them from one of the sites that has old apks
[20:40:07] <dalias> for a "stable nightly"
[20:50:18] <Timvde> dalias: you mean using the Nightly build config on stable? Because that's pretty much what Fennec F-Droid does...
[21:02:22] <dalias> yes and i just found it won't help -- nightly no longer lets you install extensions either >_<

[21:02:48] <dalias> in place of letting you install .xpi files, they have a hidden feature to let you make your own "collection" on AMO under your firefox account and whitelist that
[21:02:51] <dalias> but that's crap
[21:02:55] <sumi> who has video download helper as an add-on?
[21:03:02] <dalias> you can't install non-AMO extensions
[21:03:20] <dalias> and need to have a firefox account >_<
[21:03:34] <dalias> i just want it to open .xpi files like it should
[21:04:07] <dalias> i wonder if just putting it in profiledir/extensions will work
[21:04:20] <dalias> or does something else need to be done to enable it?

[21:45:34] <dalias> i renamed the .xpi right according to its id from the manifest and put it in $profiledir/extensions
[21:45:38] <dalias> but it still doesn't load :(
[21:51:47] <dalias> ok thankfully i missed something: the author of that addon made a collection you can install it from
[21:51:54] <dalias> so that works to get it
[21:51:55] <dalias> and it works!
[21:52:08] <dalias> still i need to find a manual install vector for other extensions i want
[21:52:30] <dalias> one idea: put an extension on AMO that exposes the "install extension" api :-p
[21:52:40] <dalias> then once you have it, you can install any .xpi
[21:54:55] <dalias> UHG WTF
[21:55:10] <dalias> if you change your collection you lose the extensions that were associated with it (!!!)
