[05:00:17] <twb> univeral income, universal healthcare, universal pension, are just incredibly cheap at the societal level.

[06:01:07] <parsnip> > In 1939 and 1940, Canada and the United States agreed to interpret the treaty so that weapons could be installed in the Great Lakes but could not be operable until the ships left the Lakes. In 1942, the United States, by then having entered the war and allied with Canada, successfully proposed that until the end of the war weapons could be completely installed and tested in the Lakes. After discussions in the Permanent Joint Board on Defense,
[06:01:07] <parsnip> in 1946, Canada similarly proposed to interpret the agreement as permitting using ships for training purposes if each country notified the other.[9]

[07:14:58] <parsnip> iiuc, repeat-command tracks commands. i'm not sure it also tracks the arguments to commands
[07:15:04] <greggo> would it always be 5 and you're just trying to create a bind that lets you can repeat it with 5 instead of the default 1?
[07:15:16] <parsnip> ^
[07:15:19] <markofcorn> ^
[07:15:42] <greggo> why do you need to use repeat command for this? Could you just make the function and keybind it direcly and just keep hitting that bind?

[07:17:49] <markofcorn> Yeah a hydra is what I'm using right now but it felt clunky to write out a hydra and bind each key in the hydra to also enter the hydra, if that makes sense. If thats the best way to do it, thats fine
[07:19:22] <markofcorn> greggo: i could just keep hitting the bind but don't i need to hit the prefix each time too? Thats what I'm trying to avoid
[07:19:27] <parsnip> i think you'd have to make someone's life easy here, by explaining with sufficient detail precisely the experience you want
[07:19:52] <markofcorn> I.e. rather hit "SPC r r r r r" as opposed to "SPC r r SPC r r SPC r r"
[07:20:10] <parsnip> imo, that is not precise enough

[07:21:42] <markofcorn> "SPC r r" to run (enlarge-window-horiz 5), but can run the command again with the arguments by only repeating the last key in the sequence, in this case "r".

[20:48:28] <jensen> noob: where can i find the official changelog for 28.1? doesn't show here (or even mention of 28): https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/emacs/emacs.html#Releases. I see there's this: https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/etc/NEWS.28 but I don't know if it's official and last commit was on Mar 3. Then there's https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/etc/NEWS which is most
[20:48:30] <jensen> recent but it's for Emacs 29

[21:07:19] <wasamasa> it has been one year and it's still not accepted
[21:07:35] <wasamasa> the person responsible for accepting it usually takes a week or so for updating emacs in the repository

[21:10:05] <wasamasa> no offense, but I'd have thought you to be a debian user
[21:10:20] <kensanata> never mind
[21:10:38] <wasamasa> I rarely hack on emacs itself, but thanks for the offer
[21:10:55] <TRS-80> jensen: You can also lurk, as parsnip is giving us the slow trickle live highlights, as we speak!  :)
[21:12:04] <parsnip> :-)
[21:12:39] <TRS-80> parsnip: IIUC, The problem with searching Gmane is that the web part of it (which included the index) is no longer there, only nntp protocoll access.
[21:12:54] <wasamasa> oh wow, normally I have the issue when updating emacs that I cannot exit it cleanly
[21:12:58] <wasamasa> but this time I could
[21:12:59] <wasamasa> fun
[21:13:05] <wasamasa> it only asked me about recentf

[21:13:56] <parsnip> so like, i could search emacs mailing list for previously reported bugs before filing a bug
[21:14:09] <TRS-80> parsnip: Well that's why, I'm fairly sure.  As I have been looking into it quite a lot in the last year or so.
[21:14:12] <TRS-80> Yes, exactly.
[21:14:13] <nosolls> I'm actually having that issue currently wasamasa
[21:14:22] <nosolls> Good timing
[21:14:23] <parsnip> to be honest, not being able to easily search email mailing list for bugs, kinds of discourages from filing a bug
[21:14:36] <wasamasa> yeah
[21:14:52] <wasamasa> there has been some discussion on the namazu search index being so bad it didn't index the last few months
[21:14:58] <TRS-80> parsnip: So to have equicalent functionality now, I am seriously considering setting up a local leafnode instance, which is a local caching news server.
[21:15:05] <TRS-80> equivalent
[21:15:09] <wasamasa> it had some suggestions on alternatives
[21:15:21] <wasamasa> there's also a SOAP using (I kid you not) interface to debbugs
[21:15:27] <wasamasa> which is what Lars uses
[21:15:40] <wasamasa> it's available on GNU ELPA
[21:15:50] <TRS-80> Org Mode is at least using public-inbox, which is another way to go about it.

[21:16:47] <parsnip> luckily my org-mode usage is trivial
[21:16:58] <wasamasa> it's literally called debbugs
[21:17:07] <wasamasa> it has a misleading description suggesting it's just a library
[21:17:16] <TRS-80> so it's not back end for Gnus (nn)?
[21:17:28] <wasamasa> no, it's a separate command doing a list view with search
[21:17:33] <TRS-80> aah ok
[21:17:59] <wasamasa> but I don't see why someone couldn't use it for a gnus backend
[21:18:05] <wasamasa> in fact, maybe Lars did that already?
[21:18:17] <TRS-80> parsnip: I am probably more likely to submit a patch to Org Mode than Emacs proper.
[21:18:27] <TRS-80> wasamasa: I would not be the least bit surprised.  lol
[21:18:39] <wasamasa> when I use M-x debbugs and open one of the bugs, I get a gnus-style view

[21:33:52] <TRS-80> Helm, bah
[21:34:54] <TRS-80> There is somewhat a renaissance (sp?) of completion frameworks now which are more modular and supposed to work with existing completion machinery in Emacs.  I keep investigating them, but have not pulled the trigger yet.
[21:35:30] <TRS-80> Things like consult, vertico, embark, etc. should get you started down that rabbit hole.

Optimized terminal redisplay is probably not on anyone's list of wanted features anymore, considering terminals are now 100% emulated and can blast text out at amazing speeds.
