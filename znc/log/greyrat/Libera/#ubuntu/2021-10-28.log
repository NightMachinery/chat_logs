[00:11:46] <trevorgib> Hi all - a bit of a new linux user here. I installed Ubuntu on a computer with a second hard drive (/media/username/DATA).  This PC used to be a Windows machine, and I'd rather not lose the data on this drive.  However everything is Read Only - can't delete, can't create new folders, etc.  I've been looking for a way to change the permissions, but the suggestions I found online aren't working.  Would you have any suggestions?

[00:58:17] <kevinnn> netplan --debug generate and netplan --debug apply both show no errors
[00:58:38] <kevinnn> I *believe* the issue has to do with my gateway address

[01:00:57] <Gallomimia> oh. i think i have my question thought of.... is it possible, or recommended, to duplicate an installation from an unpartitioned SSD onto a pair of SSDs with raid and crypto? i thought i might shrink the partition and use dd after setting it up
[01:00:57] <sarnold> kevinnn: maybe pastebin your config, the generated systemd configurations, ip a and ip r outputs, someone may have an idea
[01:01:32] <oerheks> Gallomimia, depends, standard  ubuntu would install in one partition
[01:01:39] <sarnold> Aavar: the usual port is 3128 I think, and I don't know offhand how to configure a browser to use it, it shouldn't be too hard; there's some browser plugins that you select proxy per tab, that might be helpful

[01:27:10] <Guest201> First, thanks for your work in ubuntu.
[01:27:11] <Guest201> Now, perhaps a subtle issue exists in ubuntu.  During and for a period of time after running two copies of smallhog after compiling smallhog.c for an extended mount of time (accidentally) as well as sleeping the system during this time from https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/cpu-load.html, resizing resource monitor using the secondary click and
[01:27:11] <Guest201> resize results in flickering issues including sometimes with icons from the desktop showing up above windows.  Sometimes, keep on top was enable for a couple of windows.  This issue was not reproducible after a period of time after "ctrl c"ing the two copies of smallhog.
[01:27:12] <Guest201> Environment: Using Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS in a live session with only updating a few things like gcc (Ubuntu 9.3.0-17ubuntu1~20.04) 9.3.0

[04:47:42] <Jovan> not sure but try control s, not exactly sure if it pauses the whole application or just output
[04:47:49] <sarnold> ^Z can suspend; you'd either run 'bg' to let it keep running, but detached; or 'fg' to bring it back
[04:47:59] <sarnold> you can also use ^S to stop output and ^Q to restart it
[04:48:40] <RadSurfer> none of those are working in this context.

[09:31:57] <tomreyn> do you mean graphically, or just on a "command line", a terminal?
[09:32:22] <root3> command line
[09:32:50] <tomreyn> install and thus run an openssh server on 10.64.21.1 and use an ssh client on the computer to connect to it

[10:25:03] <ash_worksi> I thought/remember (1) having an issue with pgbackrest where for some reason instead of incremental backups, it was performing full backups possibly due to some unique way we're handing data or so I was told in postgres, but we're running out of space so (2) I figured I just need something to manage retention better which I think I could just do by kicking off older backups using some application,
[10:25:07] *** Quits: SteelRose (~SteelRose@193.93.66.233) (Remote host closed the connection)
[10:25:09] <ash_worksi> which is why I was interested in logrotate but (3) logging into the server just now, it looks very much like the incremental backup was a success, only 380G on top of a 1.2T full backup; I might have an exorbinant amount of WAL logs, but I am not sure yet, still researching

[10:30:15] <ash_worksi> like if configured 2 logrotate stanzas as `{ daily\n rotate 2 }` and `{ weekly\n rotate 2 }` for the same files, then I would imagine that might work... if there is a directive to keep at least 2 files that are more than 2 days old in the former.
[10:31:01] <ash_worksi> then again, logrotate might screw with the naming convention for pgbackrest and maybe that'd screw everything up so it's probably not a solution even if that were the problem
[10:31:25] <ash_worksi> guess I'll just focus on the problem that needs solving

[13:12:30] <TJ-> ren0v0: Windows uses GRUB now?
[13:12:53] <ren0v0> maybe the utility didn't do its job i dont know
[13:13:18] <TJ-> ren0v0: so the boot from the USB image is failing?
[13:14:00] <ren0v0> yea, there were 3 options, 2 x UEFI partitions and 1 x normal, only 1 of them gave an error, let me go boot it again and photo the thing so i can remember what it says

[15:26:54] <gallomimia> take a quick backup of your install once you get it configured, but before you start doing your classword
[15:26:57] <gallomimia> work*
[15:27:04] <gallomimia> you're bound to muck something up and need to revert ;)
[15:27:29] <katnis> backup? okay imma google how to do it
[15:28:02] <gallomimia> since it's a virtual machine
[15:28:10] <katnis> HAHAHA i cant use more than 1 core!
[15:28:22] <katnis> is it because i have a quad core CPU
[15:28:42] <gallomimia> all you do is make a copy of the image file upon which you installed Ubuntu, and put it on the top shelf somewhere
[15:28:55] <gallomimia> that probably has to do with configuring the VM before you started
[15:29:03] <gallomimia> you can dial in how much ram it takes, how much CPU
[15:29:16] <gallomimia> i believe you can change that if you shutdown the VM and restart it

[18:25:15] <leftyfb> I'm using dnsmasq for local DNS caching on the wireless interface as well as a dhcp server to serve up a single address to a separate wired interface. The problem I'm noticing is dnsmasq is writing out a /var/lib/dhclient.leases when we already have a dhclient.wlp2s0.leases and depending on timing, this can cause the machine to pull 2 ip addresses. Deleting both lease files and rebooting will temporarily fix the problem. The question is, how to
[18:25:15] <leftyfb> get dnsmasq to not bother acting like a dhcp client?

[18:49:55] <leftyfb> other way around. dnsmasq is listening on wifi for dns caching and on ethernet for dhcp. For some reason it's getting the dhcp traffic for wlan even though I have no-dhcp-interface=wlp2s0 specified. It's odd because the wlan isn't asking dnsmasq for dhcp, it seems dnsmasq is asking wlan for dhcp. The lease file is prettymuch the same as the normal dhclient.wlp2s0.leases

[19:40:32] <BCB> TJ- what commands should I be using.  I've been away from my server for a while
[19:41:14] <TJ-> BCB: well, for a long time now we're standardised on systemd-networkd for server config, possibly rendered at run-time by netplan
[19:41:48] <BCB> TJ- OK.  how to I assign the addresses to the Primary interface
[19:41:55] <TJ-> BCB: I can't help you much with ifupdown alias interface stuff, not used that in over a decade

[19:43:44] <TJ-> leftyfb: the process list showed two instances of dhclient with widely different PIDs which infers they aren't related, so presumably there's something else starting the 2nd instance. Maybe create a temporary shell wrapper around /usr/sbin/dhclient that writes the PPID (parent process ID) to a file
[19:45:01] <TJ-> BCB: I don't want to push you off ifupdown but I just don't know about how ifupdown does those alias interfaces or how to fix them. If it used to work and now doesn't I'd first figure out what has been changed either in network config, package updates, or similar.

[19:52:10] <TJ-> BCB: ouch! well, take your time, and plan :) I often suggest practicing by taking a clone and using it in a virtual machine to see what needs fixing up after, before doing it on the production system
