[23:52:52] <mhmd> Hi!
[23:53:03] <mhmd> Where I live (Iran), elixir is not well known, and there aren't many resources for learning elixir in Persian/Farsi, so I thought maybe I can create a website for learning elixir in Farsi, that would be nice!
[23:53:28] <mhmd> Now I want to choose a domain name for it, something very simple, elixirprogramming.ir and programmingelixir.ir came to my mind, both are available, I wanted to know what do you think, and see if you have any other suggestions :)
[23:53:54] <sepow> Sounds like a great idea, mhmd
[23:54:39] <mhmd> I remembered pythonprogramming.net, where I learned python, and thought of elixirprogramming.ir
[23:55:46] <tristan> mhmd: might want to join erlanger slack and talk to Pourijya too. not sure if he does any Elixir, but a fellow beamer in Iran could still be of help for such a project :)
[23:56:42] <tristan> oh, that reminds me, someone reached out to translate adoptingerlang to Persian
[23:57:15] <sepow> I think elixirschool has translated content, if you want to do it a bit easier
