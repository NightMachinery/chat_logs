[00:21:36] <dimadima> ah yesss
[00:21:40] <dimadima> what are prom stats

[00:47:37] <Church> Eyep
[00:48:35] <dimadima> thanks for the translation
[00:48:57] <dimadima> i suppose i could have at least googled the "prom stats"
[01:04:30] <skyl4rk> and here I thought there was some sort of interstellar high-school ball
[01:05:33] <dimadima> tbh that's the direction my mind was headed
[01:06:06] <skyl4rk> but there has to be some competetive element as well, or who dances with who, in order for the 'stats' to make sense
[01:06:33] <dimadima> i'm not joking that's what i was trying to figure out lol
[01:06:49] <dimadima> hence my total resignation to confusion and not googling

[01:37:22] <dimadima> exploratory reading is fun
[01:40:24] <skyl4rk> did he post it himself to yc? lobsters and yc might fit into his view of social media
[01:41:06] <imode> the C2 wiki has always been a source of inspiration.
[01:41:18] <skyl4rk> I was sad when they went js
[01:41:47] <imode> tell me about it.
[01:42:00] <skyl4rk> or went unbrowsable without js ...I don't remember exactly, it /changed/ and was not the same
[01:42:33] <skyl4rk> capgras delusion but for websites
[01:42:45] <imode> it went "federated". despite not actually being federated
[01:42:49] <imode> a lot of pages were lost.
[01:43:22] <imode> I have a full dump of it when Ward converted it over.
[01:43:32] <imode> like, full.
[01:44:37] <dimadima> i am looking at https://wiki.c2.com/ for the first time
[01:45:45] <imode> you can/should browse it via archive.org
[01:45:55] <imode> there are some pages that just didn't survive.
[01:46:07] <imode> it really is a disgusting layout.
[01:46:17] <skyl4rk> oh no, it even has an enforced max-width and dropshadow now
[01:46:19] <imode> yup.
[01:46:20] <skyl4rk> :-(
[01:46:24] <imode> fuck you ward.
[01:46:30] <imode> oh my GOD.
[01:46:38] <imode> okay, try searching for literally anything.
[01:46:53] <imode> it brings up a "window" on every link you click, spawning a new iframe.
[01:46:59] <imode> how in the WORLD do you fuck that up.
[01:47:13] <imode> how do you decide "I will do the worst thing possible" and then do it to a piece of history.
[01:47:17] <imode> fuuuuck youuuuu waaaaaaaard.
[01:49:08] <imode> whatever, at least the archive has a proper mirror.
[01:49:10] <skyl4rk> I don't think I've ever searched on the page, it was always a random encounter leading into a pleasant meander through the links, but I don't need histore to compare with ...that
[01:49:15] <skyl4rk> *history

[01:50:52] <imode> here's the entire god damn source for the wiki.
[01:51:11] <imode> (it is a large page, be warned.)
[01:51:22] <imode> just wget that and run pandoc on it.
[01:51:32] <imode> congratz, static mirror.
[01:53:18] <imode> oh god nevermind, it's all packed in JSON.
[01:53:49] <imode> I loathe the web.
[01:54:23] <skyl4rk> I can't claim to be old in the computer domain but I feel I should get a good cane to wave. This calls for a good amount of cane waving.
[01:56:09] <imode> I do not understand his fetish with a non-static mirror and instead this federated wiki shit.
[01:56:29] <imode> your project is meaningless. stop breaking history.
[01:59:48] <imode> maybe I will run this through pandoc, but I don't know if it understands WikiWikiWeb markup.
[02:01:08] <imode> you can set up a pipeline of "get me the giant blob of json, run it through jq to extract the actual page content, flow that through pandoc and output the page as HTML", but only if the markup is supported by pandoc and you wire up the hyperlinks.
[02:11:08] <imode> https://wiki.c2.com/markup.js for instance.
[02:19:12] <dimadima> uses javascript modules on the web
[02:19:27] <dimadima> but also `var`
[02:19:32] <dimadima> i guess it's a free country
[02:20:45] <imode> at least I have the source to convert the markup to HTML.
[02:21:13] <dimadima> yeah it should be minified for petesake
[02:21:30] <dimadima> and when i say should, i mean it like an RFC
[02:22:06] <dimadima> what is this that you want to read it anyway
[02:22:26] <dimadima> i imagine something historically imporatnt
[02:22:37] <dimadima> it does sound familiar
[02:22:45] <imode> it is. it's essentially a proto-wikipedia where individual contributors left comments and discussions.
[02:22:51] <imode> it's the first wiki.
[02:23:16] <imode> it's very technically minded, has some good insight into various parts of computing, and gives you a view onto some parts of computing that aren't really mainstream.
[02:25:18] <skyl4rk> it also had a feeling of a, dunno, discussion forum/mailing list, ie the wiki articles were interspersed with different people's contributed knowledge and perspectives as-is, more than an updated article
[02:25:26] <skyl4rk> more personal
[02:25:38] <imode> topmind still makes me lol.
[02:53:40] <dimadima> if you're reading it and see something you like, link here?
[02:53:49] <dimadima> i would appreciate it
[02:55:51] <imode> sure, if I can find what I'm looking for in the mangled mess that is the current wiki.

[02:58:10] <imode> good for him.

[02:59:31] <imode> who's dan luu.
[03:00:35] <indigo> A software engineer with some strong opinions
[03:00:50] <imode> interesting.
[03:00:59] <imode> maybe I should start a blog and beg for money on the internet.
[03:02:30] <indigo> I'd suggest YouTube videos instead; they're more monetizable
[03:02:42] <imode> heh. what kind of opinions does dan luu have?
[03:02:53] <imode> I vaguely recall reading his "I'm stupid" or something article.
[03:03:06] <imode> willingness to look stupid.
[03:03:13] <imode> which was basically the XY problem.
[03:03:39] <indigo> Actually wow! Substack people charge $5/month per subscription
[03:03:49] <imode> ahahahaha.
[03:04:12] <imode> $60/yr for some dude's opinions.

[03:10:38] <dimadima> thanks indigo
[03:14:44] <imode> treading across the old declarative vs. imperative ground again.
[03:14:53] <imode> brings to mind an interesting question.
[03:15:18] <imode> what is the most minimally viable declarative programming language, if one exists/can be invented.
[03:23:43] <companion_cube> what do you call "declarative"?
[03:24:15] <imode> exactly.
[03:24:26] <imode> https://wiki.c2.com/?DeclarativeDefinition
[03:27:42] <companion_cube> I guess React is an ok example of that, actually
[03:28:04] <companion_cube> immutable, idempotent, and you declare what you want instead of expliciting how to update the dom
[03:30:16] <imode> I like the idea that "declarative programming deals with declarations". it's obvious but makes you think about what the hell a declaration is.
[03:30:28] <imode> it's a piece of data, but it's a part of a larger structure.
[03:33:35] <dimadima> i'm really interesting in prlog
[03:33:37] <dimadima> prolog
[03:34:00] <dimadima> although your question regarding minimiality... i'm sure prolog does not apply
[03:34:07] <dimadima> minimalism
[03:34:35] <dimadima> prolog/datalog
[03:35:10] <dimadima> most of the declarative langauges i'm familiar w/ are domain-specific, though
[03:35:20] <dimadima> like, uh, i'd consider XSLT domain-specific
[03:35:30] <dimadima> xslt is sweet though
[03:35:56] <dmc> 🫥
[03:37:27] <companion_cube> dimadima: prolog, meh, it's not more declarative  than FP imho

[04:46:51] <dimadima> Jay Z and Bernard Epstein
[05:03:37] <dimadima> companion_cube: hmm interesting
[05:03:47] <dimadima> so what are some general pupose delcarative languages
[05:05:53] <dimadima> i'm practically a lay programmer,but FP seems quite declarative at times
[05:06:21] <dimadima> the closest pure FP gets to imperative programming is function calling
[05:12:44] <imode> companion_cube: curious as to your thoughts on that.
[05:30:11] <imode> like is it declarative because you can express a lot of relations between things via the type system..
[05:34:44] <imode> I'm torn between thinking declarative is just "abstract enough to talk about your domain more" and that it's something worthy of distinction.

[13:48:07] <pja> Oo. I have been accepting into the GitHub co-pilot trial.
[13:48:13] <pja> What should I try it out on?
[13:48:18] <pja> Give me your best suggestions.
[13:51:37] <pja> Awesome. If I open a Python file with “# GNU/Linux” it immediately offers to complete it with shellcode for an exploit.
[13:51:37] <buttsbot> I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as Linux, is in fact, Windows Subsystem for Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, WSL.
[13:51:37] <buttsbot> Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free app in the Microsoft Store and part of a fully functioning Windows system made useful by the Windows OS, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.
[13:51:55] <pja> This is the kind of service no other code completion engine can manage, clearly.
[13:52:36] <pja> Admittedly, it’s for a 2017 CVE, but you can’t have everything.
[13:53:16] <riv> easy fix, add // 2021 somewhere :P
[13:54:29] <prussian> I don't know man
[13:54:56] <prussian> compare it to what "tactics" can do in HLS I guess?
[13:55:43] <pja> I haven’t actually tried HLS tactics yet.
[13:55:52] <pja> I am a bad Haskell programmer.
[13:56:00] <prussian> also that buttsbot triggered me.
[13:56:05] <prussian> because It's true.
[13:57:24] <prussian> I don't know man.
[13:57:33] <pja> Oh, you can trigger the buttsbot text in co-pilot as well.
[13:57:44] <prussian> fucking WSL
[13:57:57] <prussian> In my future job, I'll probably be forced to use that cancer.
[13:58:10] <pja> WSL is a whole lot better than nothing.
[13:58:23] <prussian> true I guess.
[13:58:26] <riv> why don't you like WSL?
[13:58:30] <pja> & if you work in a devshop that insists on using Windows & nothing else, it’s a life-saver.
[13:58:32] <prussian> because I don't use windows.
[13:58:34] <prussian> like
[13:58:35] <prussian> at all
[13:58:42] <riv> ko
[13:59:04] <riv> wsl seems good to me because it lets you run linux programs on windows
[13:59:04] <prussian> at work, I have nixos with a debootstrap created sysroot for certain crapware.
[13:59:05] <pja> Windows 10 is a surprisingly decent hypervisor for your Linux dev work in fact.
[13:59:18] <pja> Given the limitations.
[13:59:24] <prussian> I guess we'll see.

[14:06:44] <buttsbot> GitHub - arkane-systems/genie: A quick way into a systemd "bottle" for WSL
[14:07:02] <prussian> looks like no, given this having to exist implies you need pid namespace to trick systemd.
[14:07:39] <riv> just run it inside docker?
[14:08:46] <Brekkjern> Docker is already running inside Hyper-V
[14:09:07] <Brekkjern> I don't see the point in running Linux in a docker container, on docker on a Linux VM on Hyper-V?
[14:13:23] <prussian> hmm
[14:13:47] <prussian> Brekkjern: I made the mistake of helping windows users onto docker because WSL(1) was awful
[14:13:52] <prussian> and I wish I didn't
[14:14:24] <Brekkjern> Why?
[14:14:52] <prussian> because the clion "code syncing" and remote support is awful
[14:15:39] <prussian> and then when I installed clion in their lil cute docker environment, people complained that vnc wasn't as good as "remote desktop" and I should look into xrdp, and I told this one guy to do it himself.
[14:15:41] <prussian> lol
[14:15:47] <prussian> idk
