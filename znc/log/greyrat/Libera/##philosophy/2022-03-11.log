[01:33:00] <causative_> brigand, lying of all types is so tiring. There's really no such thing as a "white lie." If you lie purely out of a desire to protect another person from upsetting information, and not out of a desire to self-aggrandize or to protect yourself (or someone else) against consequences for your actions, that would be the "whitest" possible lie. And it's still not good; to shield someone from the hard truths of the world is to deny them their agency
[01:33:00] <causative_> and chance to grow
[01:33:36] <causative_> it is better - more upright, more in tune with human flourishing - to come to terms with the truth, than to comfort each other with lies
[01:34:02] <causative_> and many lies are not so kind
[01:34:09] <xx> white lies are bad, you should never protect people's feelings

[03:27:39] <IloveUveryMuch> Hi
[03:28:27] <IloveUveryMuch> How can I counter an argument like this: "Everyone has its own point-of-view, and there is no single truth"
[03:29:05] <IloveUveryMuch> Hello?
[03:29:54] <IloveUveryMuch> Anyone?
[03:31:45] <inhahe_> how about "It's merely your point of view that there is no single truth."
[03:32:18] <inhahe_> or how about "some points of view are contradicted by evidence and reason.."
[03:32:56] <IloveUveryMuch> Ok
[03:34:20] <IloveUveryMuch> But, "It's merely your [POV] that there is no single truth", does not prove that there is no single truth.
[03:34:42] <biys> sure
[03:34:47] <biys> i see nothing really wrong with that
[03:34:49] <inhahe_> you mean it doesn't prove that there is a single truth? true.
[03:34:59] <biys> but the counter would be to ask the person the possibility that they could be wrong
[03:35:01] <IloveUveryMuch> Haha

[03:37:30] <biys> the way i like to break this down is to take people down a road
[03:37:43] <biys> the road is asking them where they've determined that this or that value is more or less admirable than another

[14:47:27] <Rashad> Causality can be non-deterministic.
[14:48:26] <ProfSimm> Rashad: how come
[14:48:49] <Rashad> ProfSimm Causality is not a primary fact about the world, but a consequence of the Law of Identity.
[14:49:54] <Rashad> The Law of Identity says that things cannot contradict their nature -- gold is gold and will remain to possess the same properties forever.
[14:50:26] <ProfSimm> Rashad: identity seems more like an illusion than causality
[14:50:47] <ProfSimm> Rashad: nothing sits still, it's constantly changing, or if not, it stays the same by recreating itself with similar properties
[14:51:03] <Rashad> Since objects are "stubborn" in acting according to their nature, then their interactions will be determined by that nature.
[14:51:11] <ProfSimm> Rashad: for example, a human has identity, but their cells change constantly.
[14:51:14] <Rashad> And that is why there is causality.
[14:51:41] *** Joins: mrig (~mrig@user/mrig)
[14:51:48] <ProfSimm> Rashad: and I strongly assume the same thing happens with gold
[14:51:54] <ProfSimm> And everything.
[14:52:00] <ProfSimm> Existence is a process, not a static fact.
[14:52:09] <Rashad> If the nature of the object is that it is random, then the cause (the nature) will produce indeterministic effects.
[14:52:20] <ProfSimm> Why random tho
[14:52:45] <inhahe> the law of identity is just a tool of thought, not something that somehow presides over physical processes
[14:52:46] <Rashad> Let me go through that in order.
[14:53:01] <Rashad> You are right that change is abundant in the universe, but what is changing is the quantities not the properties.
[14:53:27] <Rashad> For example, gold might change temperature, but it cannot change from a solid at room temperature to a liquid.
[14:53:50] <inhahe> the law of identity necessarily applies no matter how much things change, how much their identities change, or how consistent they are
[14:54:19] <Rashad> That it stays the same by recreating itself with similar properties -- this is eliminated by Occam's Razor.
[14:54:40] <the_benefactor> what's the purpose for this contention Rashad
[14:54:57] <ProfSimm> Rashad: changing to liquid is a change of properties.
[14:55:02] <Rashad> inhahe The Law of Identity can be defined as a metaphysical law, in which it is a contradiction to your statement that it is a tool of thought.
[14:55:45] <ProfSimm> Rashad: it's not eliminated by Occam's Razor, look at yourself, look at society. Look at all life.
[14:55:54] <ProfSimm> Rashad: you're saying life is eliminated by Occan's Razor
[14:56:03] <ProfSimm> Occam*
[14:56:07] <Rashad> the_benefactor The purpose is to make a case for free will.
[14:56:42] <the_benefactor> and what's your case about? Rashad
[14:56:51] <ProfSimm> Rashad: things need to recreate themselves because of the same fact that causes principle of uncertainty in QM. Which is: to interact, means to change
[14:56:54] <Rashad> If the nature of a human is to have free will, then that does not violate causality in it being non-deterministic.
[14:57:03] <ProfSimm> Rashad: you can't have anything at all exist and not change, if it interacts
[15:00:06] *** Joins: Gerula (~Gerula@user/gerula)
[15:00:56] <Rashad> the_benefactor The case is as follows: 1- All choices can be reduced to one choice: To think or not to think. (If you do not think, your "choices" will be dictated by TV, tiktok, immediate sensations, etc). 2- Through introspection one can observe that this choice is volitional -- you don't enter a state of thinking without first making an effort to do so. 3- If this is the nature of the human mind, then the universe can
[15:00:56] <Rashad>  allow for a non-deterministic causality, a causality based on choice.
[15:01:41] <Rashad> ProfSimm The change in properties between a liquid and a solid can be reduced to the change in the quantity of the property "temperature".
[15:02:07] <the_benefactor> and what's the use of free will when you are not exempt from the effects of your choices, so the natures of will is that they are consequential not free
[15:02:40] <Rashad> ProfSimm How does the nature of an electron change arbitrarily?
[15:03:18] <Rashad> Can it become a tree all of a sudden?
[15:03:29] <Rashad> If it can't, why? The answer: The Law of Identity.
[15:05:00] <Rashad> the_benefactor People can choose differently even with the same knowledge of the consequences of the choice.
[15:05:29] <Rashad> The same person even.
[15:05:45] <Rashad> How and why you choose are separate from can you choose.
[15:06:04] <the_benefactor> i see
[15:06:39] <ProfSimm> Rashad: if you try to reduce a phase change to a gradual change in temperature, you kind of forgot to explain the phase change
[15:07:04] <the_benefactor> so what do you intend to convey here about the issue of the thinking and otherwise, what's your purpose for this venture, like what are you trying to teach Rashad
[15:07:07] <ProfSimm> Rashad: also temperature can be measured as quantity, but this doesn't make it a quantity. What is temperature to you
[15:07:14] <Rashad> This is the case anyway, you can point out that electrons are waves on sunday and particles on monday (disobedience of the law of identity) or that the brain's neurology is deterministic.
[15:07:31] <Rashad> (a contradiction of the introspected observation)
[15:07:39] <ProfSimm> Rashad: also "can it become a tree all of a sudden" is in fact how trees happened.
[15:07:47] <ProfSimm> Rashad: what made trees happen?
[15:08:05] <ProfSimm> Rashad: by your own logic it was quantity changes
[15:09:01] <Rashad> ProfSimm As a philosopher, I do not care much about the details of a particular physical phenomenon, but I don't think Einstein would have protested that "God does not play dice" if someone mentioned what you were mentioning.
[15:09:05] <ProfSimm> Rashad: so essentially you're saying the law of identity says trees were always around in the primordial soup, just waiting for the right temperature to reveal themselves.
[15:09:30] <Rashad> ProfSimm The idea is inexplicably change its nature, like what might be happening on the quantum level.
[15:09:35] <ProfSimm> Rashad: a philosopher should pay attention to what we know, otherwise you're setting yourself back centuries
[15:09:57] <Rashad> The Law of Identity doesn't mean there is no change at all. It says that something's nature is objective.
[15:10:10] <Rashad> It follows certain rules that do not change arbitrarily.
[15:10:21] *** Joins: Lumine (Lumine@user/luminousnine)
[15:10:23] <ProfSimm> Rashad: the problem is that the concept of "something" only exists in our heads. Existence is not an object, but a process.
[15:10:29] <Rashad> This is why prayer is misguided.
[15:10:57] <the_benefactor> misguided by? Rashad
[15:11:28] <Rashad> Well if things are objective, then they can't change by prayer; or mere wishing that things were different than they are.
[15:11:43] <ProfSimm> Rashad: do you think being conscious is something you "are" through the identity you have? What if I sedate you?
[15:11:58] <Rashad> Same goes for "holy water" (adding immeasurable properties to objects).
[15:12:06] <ProfSimm> Rashad: there's no such thing as a "thing".
[15:12:30] <ProfSimm> Rashad: if you look at the universe as a collection of things you will make a lot of incorrect conclusions.
[15:12:46] <Rashad> ProfSimm What are these conclusions?
[15:12:50] <Rashad> Or some of them.
[15:13:21] *** Joins: LunaLinda (~luna@82-132-231-87.dab.02.net)
[15:13:29] <ProfSimm> Rashad: you're making them right before me right now. Such as denying the existence of trees by accident. Because your own claim is the thing a tree is was always a tree, otherwise tree wouldn't be identified as such
[15:13:36] <Rashad> Nature proper is a list of measurable properties. In Object Oriented Programming, "nature" is the class, and properties are properties, and measurement is values for the properties.
[15:13:47] <Rashad> Notice how in OOP the class doesn't change at runtime.
[15:14:09] <ProfSimm> Rashad: except it does
[15:14:18] <the_benefactor> you seem to love this word objective, what do you mean by objective when you use that word Rashad
[15:14:25] <Rashad> ProfSimm I am happy to deny the existence of trees by accident.
[15:14:39] <Rashad> the_benefactor Objective means independent of any consciousness.
[15:14:51] <ProfSimm> Rashad: so are YOU independent of any consciousness by any chance?
[15:15:07] <Rashad> Yes and no.
[15:15:08] <ProfSimm> Rashad: I don't think we're qualified to talk about objective things in general
[15:15:23] <the_benefactor> as it really is as opposed what an observer may think it to be
[15:15:42] <ProfSimm> Rashad: all I know if that your OOP objects are merely bytes shuffling around a flat sea of RAM, so making OOP a fundamental concept of computation is already wrong.
[15:15:51] <Rashad> the_benefactor I didn't get that.
[15:16:29] <Rashad> ProfSimm OOP is just a specification of set of ideas.
[15:16:31] <the_benefactor> have you heard of the Bhagavad-Gita Rashad
[15:16:32] <ProfSimm> Rashad: when we engineer systems, we force or assume some properties to be immutable to make it EASIER for US to analyze and constrain the system.
[15:16:43] <ProfSimm> Rashad: nothing is fundamentally immutable. It's an assumption
[15:16:44] <Rashad> the_benefactor Nope.
[15:17:05] <the_benefactor> okay Rashad
[15:17:09] <Rashad> Objective means the moon is always there regardless of if anyone is looking or not.
[15:17:21] <ProfSimm> Rashad: also the idea we can model the world as a hierarchy of classes has been debunked countless time by now in 2022. It was big in the 80s but we didn't know better
[15:17:26] <Rashad> the_benefactor What is it?
[15:17:40] <ProfSimm> Rashad: do you know how JS implements hidden classes
[15:17:50] <ProfSimm> Rashad: read up on transition trees
[15:17:58] <Rashad> ProfSimm I didn't mention hierarchy.
[15:18:11] <the_benefactor> it's a vedic text coming from the hindustan system Rashad, the meaning of the name Bhagavad-Gita is, as it is Rashad
[15:18:40] <ProfSimm> Rashad: it's implied, because you can have two different things with shared properties
[15:18:53] <Rashad> ProfSimm OK so where is the debunking?
[15:18:53] <ProfSimm> Rashad: otherwise it's a bit of a clusterf***
[15:19:01] <Rashad> ProfSimm Care to explain or do you have a link?
[15:19:26] <Rashad> the_benefactor And why did you mention it?
[15:19:39] <ProfSimm> Rashad: just google "inheritance vs composition" or see new languages like go and rust not have classes at all
[15:19:46] <Rashad> Now that's bad manners.
[15:20:04] <Rashad> I don't look up what you introduce into the conversation.
[15:20:15] <ProfSimm> Rashad: the key issue is that everything you see around yourself, didn't exist at one point. This debunks your specific intepretation of constant identity
[15:20:39] <ProfSimm> Rashad: identity is a reference in your brain.
[15:20:42] <the_benefactor> the acronym	"as it is" is something that men of wisdom try to contemplate you know, i just said it as an attempt to compare your idea of objective reality
[15:20:48] <ProfSimm> Identities don't EXIST in the world
[15:20:51] <ProfSimm> Identity is conceptual
[15:21:25] <the_benefactor> isn't human being identify enough
[15:21:33] <ProfSimm> the_benefactor: you stop being human at some point
[15:21:40] <Rashad> the_benefactor Bhagavad-Gita literally means "as it is"?
[15:21:49] <the_benefactor> yes Rashad
[15:21:59] <Rashad> I see I see.
[15:22:07] <the_benefactor> at what point is that? ProfSimm
[15:22:14] <ProfSimm> Rashad: if you mean me about bad manners, well I'm giving you pointers that would inform you, because it's EXTENSIVELY covered online.
[15:22:28] <ProfSimm> Rashad: I mean you surely read some about it as a programmer yourself
[15:22:41] <Rashad> ProfSimm Would it be fare to frame the debate into this question: "If you can show one thing changing its identity arbitrarily, you have proven the Law of Identity wrong"?
[15:23:36] <ProfSimm> the_benefactor: subjective, because subjects define categories. But say in a million years when not a bit of you is left but you're part of insects, plants, animals and maybe even part of buildings and what not, surely you're not human anymore
[15:23:36] <the_benefactor> the uneducated don't go anywhere, the intellectuals go to far but the wise considers her heart and conserves his paces, moderation is where life is evident
[15:23:52] <Rashad> ProfSimm Well I can't explain the rules of debate -- you either follow them or not. I will not do your citations.
[15:23:56] <ProfSimm> Rashad: ok let's define "arbitrarily"
[15:24:26] <Rashad> Yes let's define arbitrarily.
[15:24:32] <ProfSimm> Rashad: also your own question seems to suggest identity changes. You just object to it changing arbitrarily
[15:24:53] <ProfSimm> Rashad: there's nothing arbitrary
[15:24:54] <Rashad> Let me define identity and let me define arbitrarily.
[15:25:28] <Rashad> Identity proper is a list of measurable properties.
[15:25:29] <ProfSimm> Rashad: random and arbitrary is a judgment, not reality. It's a judgment that says "I can't figure that out, so it must have no pattern to it"
[15:26:02] <Rashad> Arbitrarily means that the list of properties change without a cause, without a reason, without a justification, completely out of the blue.
[15:26:04] <the_benefactor> ProfSimm you make me laugh, identity is useful when i still exist, so why do we consider this many ages when my utilisation is for this 100 year mark i see right now ProfSimm
[15:26:20] <Rashad> If the change can be reproduced exactly, then it is not arbitrary.
[15:26:24] <ProfSimm> Rashad: I rejected the existence of cause exactly 0 times so far.
[15:26:29] <Rashad> If the change cannot be reproduced, then it is arbitrary.
[15:27:09] <Rashad> OK then it is a misunderstanding and we agree.
[15:27:17] <ProfSimm> Rashad: however defining identity as a set of measurable properties is problematic. Means if you measure properties on two things the same, they have the same identity
[15:27:34] <Rashad> Let me clarify this bit.
[15:27:40] <Rashad> A measurement includes 3 things.
[15:27:48] <Rashad> A property, a value and a unit.
[15:28:10] <ProfSimm> Rashad: I'm not sure we can reduce everything to scalars.
[15:28:15] <Rashad> For two identities to be the same, only the property part needs to be the same.
[15:28:25] <ProfSimm> Rashad: I know we can try, like IQ tries to measure intelligence as a flat number. It's also wrong.
[15:28:26] <Rashad> For two objects to be the same, all three have to be the same.
[15:28:54] <Rashad> In OOP, this is object1.equals(object2) vs object1 instanceof class && object2 instanceof class.
[15:29:21] <ProfSimm> Rashad: however he's the problem, you describe value equality, but give examples of reference equality.
[15:29:43] <ProfSimm> Rashad: in Java "equals" is by default implemented as reference equality
[15:29:51] <ProfSimm> Rashad: you can override it to implement value equality
[15:30:01] <Rashad> Intelligence has to be defined properly first before you can select a unit. IQ tests test properly test how well you did on the test.
[15:30:31] <ProfSimm> Rashad: you can have countless definitions on intelligence, but you'll never properly reduce it to a single number.
[15:30:35] <Rashad> This is believed to be a good predictor of handling further tasks.
[15:31:01] <Rashad> ProfSimm Well of course I meant value equality.
[15:31:12] <ProfSimm> Rashad: my point being what you measure is a model. The thing you measure is not itself the model though.
[15:31:25] <Rashad> A model is the class?
[15:31:45] <ProfSimm> A model is a concept in your brain. A map for a territory. But the map is not the territory
[15:31:52] *** Joins: Leonarbro (~Leonet@user/leonarbro)
[15:31:55] <Rashad> You can't measure a class, a class only lists the properties but omits the values.
[15:32:31] <ProfSimm> I find it problematic to bring Java into this because programming is artificial restricted so we can model systems in it. It's by definition not natural description of anything.
[15:32:36] <ProfSimm> It's like materialized math.
[15:32:45] <ProfSimm> Math doesn't exist outside our heads.
[15:32:52] <Rashad> OK then let's go with concepts instead of classes.
[15:33:43] <Rashad> What is the concept of life for example? One definition is: A self-sustaining chemical system capable of darwinian evolution.
[15:33:47] <ProfSimm> Rashad: I think if we observe the universe you'll notice everything that seems "stable' is made of smaller parts that are not, wouldn't you agree that's particularly the case of life and ecosystems
[15:34:16] <Rashad> These are all properties. When you change what the chemicals are, and how it evolves, and how it sustains itself, you get different forms of life.
[15:34:40] *** Joins: Filohuhum (~dante@gateway/tor-sasl/filohuhum)
[15:34:41] <ProfSimm> Rashad: before we speak of evolution we need to define how life exists at all
[15:34:43] <Rashad> For example, a dog survives differently than cats do, but they all survive (or self-sustain).
[15:34:54] <ProfSimm> Rashad: self-sustaining for example. What does that imply
[15:35:01] <ProfSimm> Rashad: self-recreating, no
[15:35:16] <ProfSimm> Life is a process, not a thing.
[15:35:34] <Rashad> "Rashad: I think if we observe the universe you'll notice everything that seems "stable' is made of smaller parts that are not, wouldn't you agree that's particularly the case of life and ecosystems" yeah that might be a fair point
[15:35:39] <ProfSimm> Nothing has an inherent property of being alive. It is however living.
[15:35:49] <Rashad> But I will go even further.
[15:35:59] <Rashad> Identity is not always reducable.
[15:36:08] <Rashad> reducible*
[15:36:21] <ProfSimm> Rashad: frankly I think if we found that it's not in some cases, it'd be a major milestone in science
[15:36:22] <Rashad> The universe can have identities that were never in it in the first place.
[15:36:43] <Rashad> A completely new identity. (This is unlike matter which is conserved, if you allow the over simplification).
[15:37:05] <bosonbear> "ProfSimm: my point being what you measure is a model. The thing you
[15:37:05] <bosonbear> 	   measure is not itself the model though." That sounds close to the Frequentist's view of distinguishign model from data
[15:37:25] <Rashad> Life is a process and a thing. The process is evolution, the thing is me and you and my cat and my lemon tree in the garden.

[15:38:00] *** Quits: mrig (~mrig@user/mrig) (Quit: WeeChat 2.8)
[15:38:23] <Rashad> But I don't think we disagree much ProfSimm, just that we're both unfamiliar with the choice of words each other is using.
[15:39:04] <ProfSimm> bosonbear: good to keep in mind yeah
[15:39:05] <Rashad> I can define alive as having the properties listed above, but you probably have another thing in mind.
[15:39:12] <ProfSimm> Rashad: sure
[15:41:06] <Rashad> So to recap a little bit, the case is: The human mind has an irreducible nature that includes free will, effects caused by this nature are as valid as deterministic cause-effect relationships.
[15:41:20] <Rashad> Not saying that is true, just that it is a case.
[15:41:59] <Rashad> And it is one that is not so commonly discussed.
[15:42:54] <bosonbear> "Life is a process and a thing" how do you define it as a "thing"? I find "lifeless" is a lot more easier to define as one can use an equilibrium system to mimic anything that is not alive. Then the opposite can also be illustraetd. In taht sense life is the deviation of equilirium
[15:44:07] <ProfSimm> Rashad: I don't know about free will. I think the idea of free will is something we keep talking about so it became its own thing, but if you dig a bit, I can't figure out any sensible meaning to it.
[15:44:36] <ProfSimm> Rashad: often people reduce free will to 'I can be random' which is an extremely depressing meaning of free will to me
[15:44:54] <ProfSimm> "Look I can do things without intending to, therefore free will" nope.
[15:44:58] <Rashad> bosonbear Here I have to explain the theory of knowledge that is based on the "three levels of consciousness." These levels are: sensation, perception, and concept formation.

[15:45:19] <Rashad> bosonbear If you had a dot in the middle of your visual field wherever you look, what do you do?
[15:45:27] <ProfSimm> It'd imply people with Parkinson have more free will. Pardon the bad example
[15:46:33] <Rashad> ProfSimm Yes that would be true. A choice between two things with the same consequences is not that much of a choice, and a choice done without consideration of consequences is also not much of a choice.
[15:47:12] <bosonbear> Rashad: I would try to investigate what causes that dot in my vision -- whether it's due to my eye or my brain's interpretation or it exists objectively such that it can be measured by an instrument
[15:47:30] <Rashad> bosonbear There is a person in society that does that job for you.
[15:47:36] <Rashad> bosonbear Can you guess who he is?
[15:48:10] <Rashad> She is specialized in this field.
[15:50:03] <ProfSimm> Rashad: free will is always defined only in specific context. Where we need to explicitly make distinction between "me" and "not me" (environment). If we don't make this distinction, "me" and "not me" is the same thing, as in, I am defined by the genes I inherit, and the environment I live in shaped me, so free will makes no sense. This is why I find discussions about free will involving QM laws to be eye-roll inducing.
[15:50:40] <ProfSimm> Rashad: it's like we want to keep moving the goalpost so the "me" is something outside existence
[15:51:09] <Rashad> ProfSimm The point from the case I mentioned is that the fact that I or you have free will comes from introspection -- the act of thinking is volitional and requires effort.
[15:51:46] <Rashad> ProfSimm In fact it is so much so, that to find that fact of introspection, you have to have entered the thinking state of mind with that effort.
[15:53:02] <Rashad> In other words you have to exercise free will before you know it exists. (According to the case).
[15:53:21] <ProfSimm> :)
[15:53:57] <the_benefactor> freewill is unrealistic
[15:54:05] <bosonbear> Rashad: sorry I don't understand. What's the person you refer to?
[15:54:30] <Rashad> In some psychological theories, the patient avoids thinking about certain things because they are emotionally painful, and the role of the psychologist is to help them do that. One classic way of avoiding thinking about a subject is by making jokes about it all the time. (Not a psychologist, nor do I claim any of that is true).
[15:55:15] <Rashad> So a psychologist is not only pointing out what is true or false, but trying to make the patient enter the state of mind where they can for themselves see what is true and what is false (and the barrier being the emotional pain).
[15:55:23] <the_benefactor> there's a potential for freewill, but then the consequence of will begs the question if we should be calling it free because you defs pay for your choices and some wills can be really costly

[16:01:08] <bosonbear> yet I don't see if this is related to the description of life as a system that deviates from equilibrium (being dead or lifeless)
[16:01:32] <Rashad> The first is sensation, which deals with single photons or single soundwaves, etc.
[16:01:48] <Rashad> But we are not directly aware (at least not normally) of such sensations.
[16:02:22] <Rashad> Instead, the brain automatically processes these sensations into what one might call "perceptions". You don't see dots of brown and white and orange, you see a cat.
[16:02:31] <Rashad> Or a bus or tree, etc.
[16:02:51] <Rashad> These perceptions in my view are the things that exist.
[16:02:59] <Rashad> Which are measurable.
[16:03:40] <Rashad> Their _nature_ however, is realized or known through the third level which is concept formation -- an even further process of integration.
[16:04:38] <Rashad> Concept formation is done by abstracting the properties of two or more perceptions, while omitting their particular values.
[16:05:21] <Rashad> Water and snow (after enough examination) will seem to have the exact same properties (those of H2O), but at different values.
[16:05:26] <Rashad> Once is colder, the other is hotter.
