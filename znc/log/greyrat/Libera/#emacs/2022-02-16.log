[02:44:32] <technomancy> TRS-80: imagine a type system where they're like "we're just gonna not handle the most common type error in existence for some reason" and that's what you have with golang
[02:44:50] <technomancy> at least python doesn't even try with the types
[02:44:51] <aidalgol> technomancy: That's not unique to go, though.
[02:45:10] <TRS-80> Catie: At first, I thought that was your take on Golang.  :D
[02:45:26] <technomancy> aidalgol: it's more or less unique among static type systems that have taken off in the past decade and don't have the excuse of "it was the 90s lol"
[02:45:35] <Catie> TRS-80: With the proper application of imagination, it could be!
[02:45:50] <aidalgol> TRS-80: Go is basically just a less shitty C, which is a *really* low bar, and even then, only for some of C's purposes.
[02:45:50] * TRS-80 was imagining it
[02:46:02] <technomancy> no one else would have the gall nowadays to hawk a static type system nowadays that doesn't actually prevent type errors
[02:46:16] <zebrag> Are you talking about the long awaited implementation of emacs in Haskell?
[02:46:17] <aidalgol> It's not *bad*, but it has a lot of design decisions that make me sit there and go, "Why?"
[02:46:25] <aidalgol> technomancy: Um... TypeScript?
[02:46:56] <technomancy> aidalgol: wait really? the fuck?
[02:46:58] <aidalgol> Kotlin?
[02:47:05] <TRS-80> aidalgol: But I thought it was better at concurrency (re: some of C's purposes)?
[02:47:05] <technomancy> Kotlin absolutely does not have this problem
[02:47:40] <technomancy> typescript I guess kinda has the excuse of "but we have to do the backwards compatibility thing" but I don't know enough about it to say whether that holds any water
[02:48:11] <dcunit3d> does Melpa have any kind of comprehensive categorization system for the packages on it? there is a "keywords" field in the `list-packages` folder, but this is more like a "tags" feature
[02:48:27] <aidalgol> TRS-80: Rob Pike has admitted publicly that it was made to solve Google's problems.  It was designed to be easy to hire cheap graduates to pick it up quickly.
[02:48:47] <aidalgol> technomancy: TypeScript was "we want Java-like static-typing in JavaScript."
[02:48:54] <Bayes> https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted
[02:48:55] <aidalgol> And it's about as good as you'd expect.
[02:49:08] <TRS-80> aidalgol: Yes, that much I knew.  Prior to reading that, I thought it was wizard stuff.  After reading that, I started trying it out.  :)

[02:50:00] <aidalgol> technomancy: Well, no, it was designed in the 2010s, based on a system from the 90s.
[02:50:06] <aidalgol> It has its own unique brain damage.
[02:50:29] <technomancy> aidalgol: ok so only google *and* microsoft have the gall [...]
[02:50:51] <aidalgol> Like, you can specify the "any" type to tell the compiler that you actually don't care about type checking on this variable.
[02:51:00] <technomancy> no one who isn't a billion-dollar company would try something like that with a straight face

[07:57:50] <bpalmer> at any rate.   (let (my-bool) ... )      instead of (progn ...)   in your code should "just work", because let is an implicit progn and you don't care about my-bool outside of that demo code anyway.

[08:05:10] <nnnnn> spikemaster: Ah, I'm a build of 29 from a week or so ago. It's possible something changed. I'll keep poking around.
[08:05:51] <nnnnn> It's more likely there's a bug in my package. Byte code problems can be tricky to figure out, though.
[08:06:05] <spikemaster> maybe the behavior of byte-recompile-directory changed too. Or maybe some nativeComp thing?
[08:06:21] *** Quits: JordiGH (~jordi@user/jordigh) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[08:06:47] <nnnnn> I doubt it's native-comp interfering, because the code is immediately loaded after byte-compilation and fails prior to the JIT native-comp kicking in.

[08:16:11] <zebrag> nnnnn: Well, I've read Jethro's new guide, and, I agree with him, in that it's mostly a few helpers around a very straightforward workflow. So, I think it's the epitome of awesomeness, as a workflow, and that I don't think anything is really missing. Actually, it's mostly, slip-box workflow, with a bit of org-mode and systematic use of ID, instead of anchors that are no ID. And sqlite behind as a helper. I don't think there is anything magic about it, but the
[08:16:12] <zebrag> workflow itself, which really is the standard slip-box workflow, is: Jethro is a master of it and he explains it very very well, especially in it's last guide.
[08:16:26] <zebrag> So, really nothing special at all
