[07:50:42] <Blondie101010> you obviously typed something wrong again
[07:51:17] <impliednude> i didn't do anything different. i swear

[07:52:07] <Blondie101010> show your output!
[07:52:09] <impliednude> it popped me to the php shell.
[07:52:17] <Blondie101010> I just gave you an example
[07:52:26] <Blondie101010> copy paste it with the command!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[07:53:06] <impliednude> [examplesite@ip-72-xxx-xx-xxx bin]$ php -r " shell_exec('ls -lad /home/examplesite/public_html/bin');

[07:53:23] <Blondie101010> you're missing the ending quote
[07:53:27] <Blondie101010> can't you seeeeeeeeeeee?
[07:53:51] <impliednude> i literally copied what you gave me -_-
[07:54:03] <impliednude> php -r " shell_exec('ls -lad /home/examplesite/public_html/bin');
[07:54:03] <Blondie101010> and that '>' was from the shell, not php
[07:54:18] <impliednude> it just dumps me into php>

[07:54:51] <Blondie101010> and again, did you pass grade 3, hence learn how to count?
[07:55:03] <Blondie101010> there is a double quote at the end
[07:55:54] <impliednude> Blondie101010.... look at your example. there is no double quote at the end

[07:56:07] <Blondie101010> look at the last character
[07:56:34] <impliednude> nothing and sorry. I took that as a comment from you
[07:56:35] <impliednude> the //
[07:56:39] <impliednude> still. nothing shows up
[07:56:50] <impliednude> zip zero zilch
[07:56:51] <Blondie101010> show your command
[07:57:01] <impliednude>  php -r " shell_exec('ls -lad /home/examplesite/public_html/bin'); // should show the directory"
[07:57:15] <impliednude> without the space at the front
[07:57:18] <Blondie101010> what does that output?
[07:57:21] <impliednude> nothing
[07:57:23] <impliednude> at all
[07:57:46] <Blondie101010> does that path really exist?
[07:57:49] <impliednude> yes
[07:58:09] <impliednude> i can literally type cd /home/examplesite/public_html/bin and it drops me into the directory
[07:58:35] <impliednude> i also gave you the output earlier
[07:58:37] <Blondie101010> if not found, it should output an error like in my case
[07:58:41] <impliednude> i know
[07:59:20] <impliednude> I am just confused why it isn't working
[08:00:16] <Blondie101010> is there any error log?  php -i|grep error_log
[08:00:55] <impliednude> nothing added within the last two hours
[08:01:12] <impliednude> i have it by directory
[08:01:20] <impliednude> so its easier to find
[08:01:28] <Blondie101010> what is the output of my command?
[08:01:52] <Blondie101010> your interpretations are generally wrong and poorly copied
[08:02:31] <impliednude> error_log => error_log => error_log
[08:02:32] <impliednude> opcache.error_log => no value => no value
[08:02:38] <Blondie101010> ok so not that

[08:13:10] <Blondie101010> but the discrepancy you got with running ls is weird
[08:13:27] <impliednude> i switched my script to system and it started actually doing the macro's i have...
[08:13:55] <impliednude> and i agree
[08:14:10] <impliednude> thing is, this is a vps that i have root on

[08:14:39] <Blondie101010> forget that

[08:16:37] <Blondie101010> so?  (final test for me)
[08:17:25] <impliednude> yes that works
[08:18:28] <Blondie101010> so show a command that doesn't
[08:18:29] <impliednude> do you think if this is a local php script that can't be accessed other than local its alright to run it as system()?
[08:18:57] <Blondie101010> don't know what you mean
[08:22:36] <impliednude> i think i just had an idea. thanks for your time. also, can i paypal ya or just send eternal gratitude?
[08:23:05] <impliednude> well when i went to run my script as system() it worked perfectly without any issues. so i will just stick with that

[14:41:46] <Naktibalda> stat(__FILE__)[4] would give uid of owner of current file
[14:42:06] <hans> TinoDidriksen: i was hoping to get the current user id without depending on php-posix to be available.. well, i want to know if i'm root or not
[14:42:20] <hans> Naktibalda: neat, thanks
[14:42:26] <TinoDidriksen> But that's not what getmyuid() does at all.
[14:42:45] <TinoDidriksen> You need Posix to get the process UID. There's no way around that.
[14:43:15] <Naktibalda> his workaroud function creates and executes file :)
[14:43:53] <hans> TinoDidriksen: are you sure it wouldn't work with $t=tmpfile();$uid=stat(stream_get_meta_data($t)['uri'])[4];  ?
[14:44:23] <TinoDidriksen> Ok, I'll concede that is a possible way to get the EUID.
[14:45:23] <TinoDidriksen> But that should be used sparingly. Posix you can fire off whenever you want, but creating a file is several orders of magnitude more resource intensive.
[14:45:45] <hans> good point

[14:49:35] <hans> o right, i get both
[14:49:41] <hans> [4] and ["uid"] both exists
[14:49:51] <TinoDidriksen> Then ['uid'] is nicer code.
[14:50:02] <hans> idd
[14:51:05] <Naktibalda> what environment has user ids but no posix?
[14:51:54] <hans> the environment that didn't include `sudo apt install php-posix`
[14:52:18] <hans> would be a nicer fix to just require that the posix extension is available i suppose
[14:52:33] <TinoDidriksen> What do you even need the UID for? If you need it, then you can almost certainly get away with requiring Posix.
[14:53:42] <hans> need to check if i'm root to execute some tests that only root is allowed to execute (sigh, only root is allowed to communicate with some docker instances for some reason)
[14:54:17] <TinoDidriksen> That's up to the server admin. They can grant anyone access to the Docker socket and group.
[14:55:02] <TinoDidriksen> But that is effectively the same as granting root.

[16:18:46] <chazy> hi, maybe someone here can confirm me what i think i know, the team creating the client-side of a game is telling me that they can't use the php backend i have because the framework does lots of security checking that are only compatible with a browser, and i'm trying to tell them that it doesn't matter what client is trying to communicate with the backend, that as long as they include both the
[16:18:47] <chazy> session id (to know which user is logged in) and the csrf token for post requests, then they should have no problem communicating with the server whatsoever
[16:19:04] <chazy> can i be wrong?
[16:22:06] <Naktibalda> what backend would be acceptable to them?
[16:26:28] <chazy> i don't think they've made an online game, the dude in charge of UE was looking up how to work with json, apparently he prefers arrows and boxes to real programming

[17:05:53] <chazy> but there's something i don't understand here, in this client that's not a browser, users are presented with a login form such as the one from the website
[17:06:46] <__adrian> presumably logging in issues them an api token
[17:07:29] <__adrian> or, authorizes the user to use the api token stored in the app
[17:07:38] <TinoDidriksen> Tokens are usually very long lived, though, and not tied to any client. You can get one via whatever means, even a browser, and then use it for other clients.
[17:08:40] <chazy> you mean that instead of entering their password, they enter the token in the password field?
[17:09:07] <__adrian> the client would send the api token with each request
[17:09:22] <TinoDidriksen> A token is used instead of both username and password (and 2FA).
[17:09:36] <__adrian> as for why this client also asks for a password, i speculated a bit above, but i couldn't say
[17:10:10] <TinoDidriksen> A token is not the same as an "app password" where you still need the username.

[20:01:37] <AllenJB> Usually you create an admin as part of the application setup. This might be done automatically (with a randomly generated password), through a setup form, or a commandline tool
[20:01:58] <judah> Many frameworks have a console command to help generate a default user
[20:02:21] <relipse> ok command line tool nice

[20:53:39] <silv3r_m00n> hi there, this question is not related to php ... i bought a whm vps, what are the pros/cons of cpanel addon domain vs whm separate domain account ?
[20:55:28] <AllenJB> silv3r_m00n: I would suggest asking that in a more general webdev / linux / server admin channel, or you could use the #phpc off-topic channel
[20:55:48] <silv3r_m00n> oh ok, thanks, let me try that
[21:00:57] <Naktibalda> or #cpanel

[21:05:47] <judah> silv3r_m00n, in my WHM instance I group things by project. Different projects/customers under different accounts, various resources within a project can be addon domains
[21:06:19] <judah> The catch is that you cant really set up quotas or tune performance for addon domains as well as you can for full accounts
[21:06:37] <judah> Though addon domains are free, cPanel charges per account. Its not much, but its an added cost.
[21:07:55] <silv3r_m00n> i have this bluehost vps server with whm/cpanel and they wont charge my for addon domains
[21:07:59] <silv3r_m00n> i can create as many as i like
[21:08:17] <silv3r_m00n> just that addon domains are quick and easy to setup, whm is a whole lengthy separate set of username/password mess
[21:08:44] <judah> I hear ya
[21:09:31] <judah> Oh, security is another aspect. If one site gets compromised, everything in that account is compromised. If you segregate into multiple accounts then you are safer
[21:09:47] <judah> pros/cons all around

[23:54:16] <chazy> does pdo fetch everything as strings, or if a column is decimal will it fetch it as float?
[23:55:04] <TinoDidriksen> Depends on RDBM and whether emulated prepares are on.
[23:55:16] <chazy> mariadb and off?
[23:55:36] *** Quits: krux02 (~krux02@p50822195.dip0.t-ipconnect.de) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[23:55:42] <TinoDidriksen> Pretty sure MySQL and MariaDB are strings both in and out.

[23:56:12] *** Quits: sebbu (~sebbu@user/sebbu) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[23:56:23] <__adrian> note float ≠ decimal. decimals will always be fetched as strings.
[23:56:39] <TinoDidriksen> Ah, requires mysqlnd.
[23:56:56] <__adrian> in other words, always depends on the driver.
[23:57:09] <chazy> how do i know if pdo is built upon mysqlnd?
[23:57:16] <__adrian> phpinfo()
[23:57:24] *** Joins: sebbu (~sebbu@user/sebbu)
[23:57:34] <__adrian> but the tl;dr is, unless you have foolish installation, it is
[23:58:13] <__adrian> i don't know how drivers for other rdbms's behave. i'm sure this line was meant to compare against libmysql.
[23:58:13] <chazy> so i have to take care of booleans and decimals/doubles
[23:58:23] <__adrian> decimal ≠ double
[23:58:27] <__adrian> float = double
[23:58:38] <__adrian> and no, definitely do not convert decimals to float.
[23:58:40] <chazy> so pdo will fetch double as float?
[23:58:50] <__adrian> double === float
[23:58:58] <__adrian> there's not different things in php
[23:59:03] <__adrian> *they're
[23:59:40] <chazy> ok so should i work with decimal numbers as strings?
[23:59:50] <__adrian> php has no "decimal" type. keep them as strings.
