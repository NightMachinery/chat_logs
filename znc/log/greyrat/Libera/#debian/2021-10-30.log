[01:23:10] <tomreyn> Khepra: so i tried to explain how -u does not create a new one if the existing initrd seems to be "up to date". Looking at update-initramfs, what it does differently between -c and -u is that with -u it additional does (amongst other)  altered_check(), which is where it compares sha1 checksums
[01:24:01] <Khepra> tomreyn: which file has that function?
[01:24:29] <tomreyn> /usr/sbin/update-initramfs - but i must admit i'm looking at an ubuntu one.
[01:24:37] <Khepra> yeah, no such thing in debian
[01:25:11] *** Joins: grobi (~grobi@user/grobi)
[01:25:21] <Khepra> so what does that do in ubuntu? creates the new initrd in a temp file then compares checksums with the existing one?

[01:27:34] <Khepra> but important thing is, all the hooks are still executed for all the sideffects they might have
[01:28:12] <Khepra> ie. it actually has to generate the initrd  (in order to compare it with existing and skip the overwrite if it's exactly, 100% same)

[01:29:00] <tomreyn> here's ubuntu 18.04's /usr/sbin/update-initramfs
[01:29:16] <Khepra> what I think is happening here, for "Nothing to do, exiting", is that there are no kernels in /boot. update-initramfs uses `linux-version list` which enumerates versions found in /boot
[01:29:41] <Khepra> one possiblity, for mounted /boot, s/he forgot to mount it
[01:29:54] <tomreyn> the last function before the main script is altered_check there, which i'm indeed surprised tosee doesn't exist on debian 11

[01:31:12] <tomreyn> that is obviously so, just that seems like nice to have

[01:32:11] <tomreyn> (and also much of the non-basic ;) )
[01:32:37] <Khepra> ubuntu has for many years now been a completely separate system that only uses apt and does a few source debs from debian unstable for some packages
[01:33:13] <Khepra> different defaults, different package versions, different patches. it's basically only "an apt based" distro, with coincidental similarities to debian.
[01:33:59] <tomreyn> "a few"? i would think hundreds, maybe thousands.

[05:27:59] <nutron> Fun question.  I will have a few debian workstations in different locations.  Need to admin them from a distance, but all have different routers and ip's.  Is there a method to have a regular user login to a central location where I can take over the machine?  I don't want to create port forwards for the 10 machines behind each router.

[06:23:11] <zumba_addict> since our office laptop is not useful anymore for other stuff I want to do, lol, I want to buy a personal laptop and install debian. What brand would you recommend? I was told Thinkpad is great
[06:26:01] <nutron> I have no control over the routers put in place unfortunately but it's multiple locations, so managing all of that seems unfortunate.  Like I'd have to login to a machine to add a user, remove one etc.  Basic stuff.
[06:26:25] <nutron> CarlFK, that's a thought.
[06:26:46] <nutron> I see things like teamviewer on the windows side of the landscape... Is there such a thing for debian?
[06:26:54] <nutron> Or something with the same functionality
[06:28:22] <nutron> I like the tunnels idea, but since I've never done that, that pops up new questions.  This side box, with the ssh connections, can I automate the connections to this box (to reconnect upon disconnections) and how do I go backwards through the tunnel?  Ie. From my office computer, to this so-called side box and back through to the workstations I need to reach?

[16:25:29] <Khepra> right. so better looking at it, I see it's not just subpixel, the fonts are different too
[16:25:53] <Hund> It should both the Sans.
[16:27:27] <Khepra> the right one is picture or is that how qute is rendering it? what's on the left side?
[16:28:26] <Hund> The picture on the left is my image viewer showing the sceenshot from Debian and the one to the right is qutebrowser running in Gentoo.
[16:28:50] <Khepra> two things are relevant here. First, how a browser interprets missing font replacement. Second, if there's a default font for pages that don't set any font family.  I initially thought this was about subpixel because the right side shows the typical aliasing

[16:32:11] <Khepra> Hund: so which font family are you seting?
[16:32:27] <Hund> sans

[16:32:52] <Hund> Yes.
[16:33:03] <Khepra> yeah, well, that's gonna pick up _some_ "Sans" font, but I don't know how fontconfig decides which one. liberation? dejavu? something else?
[16:33:18] <Khepra> ooh helvetica. that on the right side looks like  helvetica.
[16:33:24] <Hund> It's just not the web browser that's the issue. It's the same issue with any other application.
[16:33:58] <Hund> It's thick and blurry text in both Qt and GTK applications
[16:34:18] <Hund> The website was just a demo as it shows the issue the best.
[16:34:22] <Khepra> for that definitely take a look at subpixel rendering and lcdfilter
[16:35:04] <Khepra> in my case, when I had an issue with that, it was the other way around: crisp, unaliased, fugly font until I set subpixel to RGB, then it antialiased nicely.   also, that was on gentoo. I never had to deal with that in debian, I guess fontconfig is already sane

[17:03:57] <Hund> I'm uploading a new screenshot now. It's the same as the previous one though.
[17:04:03] <Hund> But with "DejaVu Sans".
[17:04:21] <Hund> In qutebrowser.
[17:04:46] <dob1> I found a very strange thing (that I don't like), or it's my system: using xrdp when I connect to it the first time, after a boot I got this: https://paste.debian.net/hidden/33b27cad/
[17:04:58] <dob1> only the first time
[17:05:15] <Khepra> Hund: does qute have "developer mode" which can show what font is actually used for rendering?
[17:05:41] <Hund> It refuses to upload the shit now...
[17:05:49] <Hund> I'll ask.

[17:08:07] <Khepra> Hund: so what's that, qute in debian?
[17:08:38] <Hund> Yes.
[17:08:47] <Khepra> okay, and gentoo?
[17:09:13] <Hund> https://cloud.operationtulip.com/s/6tZFbHtGBygK2Hc/preview
[17:09:21] <Hund> You've already seen it.,
[17:09:45] *** Joins: Nex8192 (~Nex8192@user/nex8192)
[17:09:59] <Khepra> well I asked you to compare them when your site specifies   font-family: DejaVu Sans;    and not just "sans"
[17:10:03] <Khepra> that's teh whole point here
[17:11:14] <Khepra> again:   your original pic shows different renderings for "sans" font family. THAT means each browser/distro has OPTION which font to substitute for "sans".   if you specify an actual font and not just family "sans", then look at differences if any
[17:11:51] <Khepra> if tehre aren't (both deb and gentoo render the same)   then that means fontconfig picks DIFFERENT font when just family "sans" is specified
[17:12:33] <Khepra> if there are differences (deb and gentoo render differently, even for specific font-family, and not just "sans"), then the problem is elsewhere
[17:13:03] <Hund> https://cloud.operationtulip.com/s/dTATxkcNPWM8RAx/preview
[17:13:04] <Khepra> to make the test actually comparing apples to apples, make sure gentoo has eselect'ed the font you're specifying in css, eg. Dejavu Sans
[17:13:07] <Hund> Happy?
[17:13:13] <Hund> It's the exact same thing.
[17:13:34] <Hund> I wouldn't be able to use the font it it wasn't enabled..
[17:13:50] <Khepra> and to confirm, this latest pic is with your site specifying   font-family: DejaVu Sans;   ?
[17:13:55] <Hund> Yes.
[17:14:02] <Khepra> Hund: would you know the difference? fontconfig would just pick another
[17:14:07] <Hund> Yes.
[17:14:17] <Hund> I've been using DejaVu Sans for a long time.
[17:14:24] <Khepra> right. but this is not dejavu sans. so your gentoo has a problem.
[17:14:41] <Khepra> this looks like helvetica or something similar to it
[17:15:07] <Khepra> the other one, the debian one, shows DejaVu alright.
[17:15:49] <Khepra> does qute have "developer mode" which would show, like in firefox, for example, which font is actually used in rendering?
[17:16:33] <Hund>   [28]  57-dejavu-sans-mono.conf *
[17:16:35] <Hund>   [29]  57-dejavu-sans.conf *

[22:08:17] <shalok> I put `setxkbmap -option compose:caps` in my ~/.xprofile to make the (otherwise useless) caps lock key behave as a compose key.
[22:08:21] <shalok> This works fine immediately after log in but some time later (hours or days later) it will stop working and caps lock again behaves like caps lock instead of compose key.
[22:08:24] <shalok> I've tried many different applications, locking, screen savers, sleep but I can't figure out exactly how to reproduce it on demand.
[22:08:28] <shalok> How can I figure out what is causing it to reset to the unwanted default behavior so that I can fix it?
[22:10:26] <sney> maybe there's a loose connection, causing it to occasionally be detected as a "new" device? that would show in dmesg
[22:11:20] <shalok> It's a laptop builtin keyboard.
