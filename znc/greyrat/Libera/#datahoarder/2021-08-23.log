[00:34:58] <ThePendulum> ,ducks skye0
[00:34:59] <unfinity> skye0 has killed 0 ducks and befriended 77 ducks in #datahoarder.
[00:35:24] <ThePendulum> what do you feed 'em
[00:35:47] <skye0_mobile> i refuse to give them bullets
[00:36:25] <skye0_mobile> these ducks still aren't enough to replace my empty social life. if i got a dog idk how i'd cope if they passed away soon or whatever. not an animal person otherwise
[00:36:40] <skye0_mobile> this is even though i love meat too much
[00:36:45] <skye0_mobile> and have eaten duck a few times
[00:37:06] <ThePendulum> so it's not so much that you befriended them, you're just keeping them for later?
[00:38:13] <skye0_mobile> well it's nice to have them i guess but i'm not an animal person. don't like shooting anyone who can't even use a gun
[00:38:58] <ThePendulum> it's much easier
[00:39:39] <skye0_mobile> easier to kill them, yes, but i like a challenge so as not to look like a noob and feel like a monster
[00:40:25] <ThePendulum> so you're like their duck daddy now
[00:41:01] <skye0_mobile> duck parent but idk if i'd like to be a parent, just their friend
[00:41:11] <skye0_mobile> even though i barely acknowledge them most of the time
[00:42:22] <ThePendulum> they'll be fine
[00:42:58] <ThePendulum> https://www.moanmyip.com/
[00:43:12] <skye0_mobile> glad to hear ThePendulum
[00:43:37] <skye0_mobile> glad to know the ducks will be fine
[00:44:06] <brimstone> ,bef
[00:44:07] <unfinity> brimstone you befriended a duck in 188029.890 seconds! You have made friends with 111 ducks in #datahoarder.
[00:44:15] <brimstone> poor little duck left out in the cold
[00:44:35] <brimstone> FOR DAYS!

[01:03:13] <ThePendulum> nervous about the long term effects?
[01:05:31] <skye0_mobile> nervous i'm gonna get an allergy to something i can't avoid or whatever, idk
[01:05:48] <skye0_mobile> had a drink of whiskey but idk if it's gonna help or whatever

[21:31:00] <joepie91> ThePendulum: nono, call them
[21:31:10] <joepie91> the only way to get anything done with paypal in NL is to call them
[21:31:17] <ThePendulum> ugh, I fucking hate phone calls 
[21:31:31] <joepie91> I do too, but in the past few cases I've needed them, they were actually shockingly helpful
[21:31:44] <joepie91> whereas I've never had a single response to the contact form
[21:33:35] <ThePendulum> their dashboard doesn't even show my account is locked, I'm confused by what's going on. all the links in the email go directly to PayPal.com so it doesn't seem like a phishing attempt 
[21:33:47] <joepie91> yeah their UI is an unreliable piece of shit
[21:34:03] <joepie91> keep in mind that paypal is still running basically every version of their UI going back to the 2000s
[21:34:07] <ThePendulum> what's their alert center? 
[21:34:11] <joepie91> and some notifications only show up in some versions
