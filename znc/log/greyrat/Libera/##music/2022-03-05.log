[03:50:41] <DOMF> you know what was really fun was Fallout: New California
[03:54:43] <macrobat> fallout was too hard. I died in the first room at the first rat and uninstalled
[03:55:36] <DOMF> I definitely prefer the FPS/actionrpg interface to the iso interface
[03:56:18] <DOMF> I would love a new single player fallout game
[03:56:29] <DOMF> (Like a Fallout 5 or something)
[03:56:56] <DOMF> I'm super curious how things were post-war in the rest of the world
[03:57:06] <DOMF> like what would Fallout: Europe be like
[03:57:45] <macrobat> interface was not fun. hard to know where I and the baddies were situated in space etc
[03:59:38] <DOMF> 100%
[03:59:59] <DOMF> new california is fps though

[05:36:41] <Janet> ^ Crypt of the Necrodancer OST - Crypteque (1-2 with Shopkeeper) - YouTube
[05:37:54] <macrobat> if a game tune is too good, won't that distract from playing?
[05:38:25] <R2robot> well in this case, it's partially a rhythm game.. so it really enhances the game imo
[05:38:49] <R2robot> it's like a dungeon crawler, but you move in time with the beat
[05:39:03] <R2robot> hence the necroDancer and not necromancer :D
[05:39:38] <R2robot> that song has the shop keeper 'singing', but in the game, you only hear him if/when you get close to the shop.

[17:13:40] <Awaru> what is better .m4a or .ogg ?
[17:13:47] <Awaru> better quality i mean
[17:14:22] <labrador> Awaru, depends on what is inside it
[17:14:27] <labrador> These are container formats
[17:14:29] <labrador> not codecs
[17:14:39] <Awaru> a song
[17:16:34] <Awaru> so??
[17:16:38] <Awaru> .ogg is better or?
[17:20:47] <louipc> depends on the encoding. ogg is more open i guess
[17:20:50] <louipc> so thats nice
[17:21:05] <louipc> but probly less compatible
[17:21:24] <Acheron> depends on the quality of the source material as well
[17:22:54] <Awaru> ok so no answer that lead me to anything
[17:23:33] <Acheron> for 'most' people a well encoded 128 MP3 is good enough
[17:23:45] <labrador> Awaru, a song is not a codec...
[17:23:48] * labrador facepalms
[17:24:26] <labrador> Go show us the actual codecs in use...like ogg itself can contain vorbis or opus
[17:24:36] <labrador> And I forgot what kinda stuff m4a can contain
[17:24:58] <Awaru> thats another ting there are 2 versions vorbis and opus also dont know which one i should take
[17:25:41] <louipc> choose m4a to be safe
[17:25:41] <Awaru> 1 example: ogg, one is vorbis 129k, one is opus 125k
[17:25:44] <labrador> Awaru, they aren't versions...they're different codecs. You fundamentally misunderstand file formats and codecs
[17:25:45] <louipc> for compatibility
[17:25:56] <labrador> Awaru, opus always wins
[17:26:02] <labrador> Especially at this close of a difference
[17:26:14] <macrobat> opus is the newer thing
[17:26:27] <labrador> macrobat, most pcs can play opus
[17:26:29] <macrobat> opus is variable bitrate
[17:26:31] <labrador> Without any changes
[17:26:45] <Awaru> i wanna make a remix
[17:26:50] <macrobat> good for streaming
[17:27:01] <Awaru> out of these songs
[17:27:17] <Awaru> so ofc i want the best quality
[17:27:36] <labrador> Awaru, hmmm would sound like shit if the og is not in flace
[17:27:38] <labrador> flac*
[17:28:08] <macrobat> audio quality is adjustible
[17:28:17] <macrobat> adjustable
[17:28:38] <labrador> macrobat, losing audio quality at the production step is a bad idea
[17:28:41] <labrador> That loss compounds
[17:29:17] <macrobat> when you edit, you load the file and later save as something non-lossy while having the option to export to any format
[17:29:24] *** Quits: keypusher (keypusher@user/keypusher) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[17:29:46] <louipc> use wavs for production
[17:29:46] <labrador> macrobat, saving it to non-lossy doesn't really matter if the og itself is opus.
[17:30:02] <labrador> louipc, eh flacs work too
[17:30:06] <macrobat> load the audio in both formats, if you can't hear or detect any difference, does it really matter?
[17:30:25] <labrador> And you can transcode flacs to wav at will without losing audio quality
[17:30:29] <louipc> flacs are for end product, not really for production
[17:30:59] <labrador> louipc, thats true. But to make a remix he probably is not going to get production master wavs or something
[17:31:08] <labrador> He'll buy a flac from bandcamp...most likely
[17:31:29] <labrador> And then transform it to wav with no change in sound quality!
[17:31:38] <louipc> yea
[17:31:38] <morf> Putin: The sanctions imposed on us are like declaring war on Russia
[17:31:57] <macrobat> non-lossy is reasonable for potential further editing, for having a fixed quality copy
