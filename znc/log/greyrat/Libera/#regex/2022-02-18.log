[01:39:52] <OnlineCop> PCRE, Javascript, Java?
[01:40:24] <dandyn> tcl :P
[01:40:51] <OnlineCop> I like to wrap repeating groups, myself: `(?:.*?\n){4}` or whatever.
[01:40:56] <OnlineCop> Tcl was PCRE, though?
[01:41:35] <dandyn> but if you don't know how many \n there is.. might be different ?
[01:47:38] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/zNhYoT/5 mostly for fun.
[01:49:05] <OnlineCop> I really try to avoid using `.*` or `.*?` because if something LATER fails to match, it will do all sorts of backtracking. So things like `".*"` or `".*?"` seem like they would be fine, but when backtracking DOES happen... those will match from "one string" clear into "a different string".
[01:49:26] <OnlineCop> But with `"[^"]*"`, it can't match another double quote, so won't over-match.
[01:49:42] <dandyn> ah nice
[01:51:06] <dandyn> we grabed 4/5  we also have a film called The Ghosts of Borley Rectory (2021) at the bottom of the source..
[01:51:13] <dandyn> any idea why that wasn't grabed?
[01:52:52] <dandyn> oh..
[01:53:14] <dandyn> 3/5.. I see the problem.. the other movies doesn't have metascore
[01:53:27] <OnlineCop> Make that group optional?
[01:54:45] <dandyn> sounds like a great plan

[01:57:06] <dandyn> wonder why the 5th wasn't included.. somethings different with that.
[01:58:37] <dandyn> but hey, maybe I keep to the one with metascore.. so I can  do a little check there if the movie is any good or not :)

[08:00:02] <p-i-> So in my source-text I have TARGETS\n followed by one-number-per-line
[08:00:10] <p-i-> And I'm trying to pick up those numbers
[08:00:48] <p-i-> ( ^ (?&Decimal) \n)+
[08:00:58] <p-i-> How is this not correct?
[08:01:37] <p-i-> The pattern is a line-start followed by a decimal
[08:01:41] <p-i-> repeated 1 or more times
[08:04:19] <digitok> you are not matching the extra newline before SL
[08:05:04] <p-i-> geeeee
[08:05:06] <p-i-> thanks!
[08:05:22] <p-i-> How can I improve my debugging skills to pick up things like this?
[08:05:34] <p-i-> digitok: What's your process? Do you just "spot it"?
[08:06:27] <purplex> good question
[08:06:51] <p-i-> I need to become less dependent on you guys
[08:06:57] <p-i-> & learn to fix my own shit
[08:08:50] <purplex> good thinking welll he reads and understands regex much faster so it seems like "just spotting" it
[08:09:55] <p-i-> yeah if you have mastery of the language, you can just 'spot it'. But for someone in the process, it's not clear where the error is coming from.
[08:10:08] <p-i-> I suppose I should have reduced to a testcase and I would have got it
[08:14:20] <p-i-> ok I'm going to strip things down from now on
[08:14:49] <p-i-> https://regex101.com/r/nZOQYh/1 I have a problem here. It's putting the last target in a separate group.
[08:15:01] <p-i-> It's correctly adding it to the 'targets' group.
[08:15:15] <p-i-> But why is it creating this unnecessary 'Group 2'?
[08:17:29] <p-i-> What I'd really like to do is have a generic way to pull out all `Decimal` objects until the next token match
[08:18:05] <digitok> your inner group is a capturing group, so it will capture the value of its last repetition
[08:18:18] <digitok> change it to a non-capturing group (?: ... )
[08:18:35] <p-i-> ah, thanks!
[08:18:58] <p-i-> That way if my input is '100 - 110', '110\n110\n120\n' '100 to 120' or 'from 100 to 120', it would still always just get the list of `Decimal` objects.
[08:19:07] <digitok> one thing that can help a lot with debugging is removing things from the end of the regex until it matches
[08:19:08] <p-i-> I think I need the 2-step process for this, if I understand right
[08:19:53] <p-i-> Yes, that's what I'm doing. I'm prepending `#` to every line and taking them out one by one top down until I get the fail
[08:26:44] <p-i-> Super, https://regex101.com/r/nZOQYh/2 works!
[08:28:47] <digitok> looks like .? on line 4 should be *?
[08:29:14] <p-i-> 👍

[08:49:54] <p-i-> I tried changing [\s\S]* to [\s\S]*? .. IIUC this makes more efficient regex, as * matches greedily, so it's constantly matching to the end of the string

[23:16:48] <re101-fly-4327> to be honest, that is not ideal. The goal is to get the space characters within a string for a lexical analyzer i am building
[23:17:14] <re101-fly-4327> I see what you mean, "no" "no" the space between the two strings should not get counted if possible
[23:19:40] <mysticspiral[m]> how about getting all quoted strings first with this and then count the spaces with a second regex? https://regex101.com/r/P3ZjJO/6
[23:21:11] <mysticspiral[m]> wont support nested quotes
[23:21:40] <re101-fly-4327> the first option might work, but the lexer takes in a program like this:
[23:21:40] <re101-fly-4327> { int a = 3
[23:21:41] <re101-fly-4327> string b = "get these spaces"
