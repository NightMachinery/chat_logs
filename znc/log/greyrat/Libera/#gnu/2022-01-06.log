[00:09:51] <isf> distribution
[00:10:02] <isf> is when you take something and you share it
[00:10:13] <isf> you can distribute something with a price or not
[00:10:41] <isf> so, distribution of GNU Operating System, is when you use the freedom 3 or freedom 2 to distribute the software how you wish
[00:11:02] <isf> thats the reason sadly a lot of distributions of GNU Operating System are propietary distributions
[00:11:44] <isf> thats bad, but we have a fully free as in freedom distributions of GNU Operating Systemd
[00:11:48] <isf> System*
[00:12:08] <isf> https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html gregaras
[00:12:45] <isf> you can make distribution of all, distribution of bread, distribution of carrots, distribution of software, etc for a price or not
[00:13:06] <isf> distribution isnt a technical or informatic word 
[00:13:17] <isf> is only about share, with or without price.
[00:14:43] <isf> so, when we speak about free software WE NEVER SPEAK about price, if is $300 or 0$ that arent important, becouse is about freedom.

[02:23:35] <jkk> cant say programming is evil per se however its role is ...
[02:24:45] <jkk> https://copilot.github.com/ idiots training neural nets Xd
[02:25:04] <Kaiod> jkk: There is not exactly a timetable, there are some longer and some shorter hours of activity, it depends on the availability of each person.
[02:26:13] <Kaiod> Kaiod: The programming itself is not bad, because it is not a conscious organism. But programming is a knowledge, and therefore its good use depends on who has this knowledge.
[02:27:52] <jkk> it depends
[02:28:00] <jkk> some knowledge is not wise to release
[02:29:27] <jkk> to people under influence of religions :)
[02:30:44] <Kaiod> <jkk> "https://copilot.github.com..." <- I was one of the first to test the copilot, as soon as Microsoft sent out the technical preview invitations. Copilot itself, although very well developed, is a terrible intelligence in itself. While it does its job reasonably (but not always), it creates unnecessary convenience, and it steals code typed into the visual studio and uses it mindlessly. In addition, it does not mention who developed the code that is
[02:30:44] <Kaiod> being posted, thus breaking numerous free and non-free licenses.

[02:34:25] <Kaiod> jkk: You cited two different contexts. The knowledge in programming, is a technical knowledge and depends on study and improvement according to the person's need (good or bad, it makes no difference in this matter).
[02:34:25] <Kaiod> The religious issue, on the other hand, is not necessarily a domination of knowledge, it can even be the reason for the lack of knowledge or submission to psychological and social vulnerabilities. There are atheists who are excellent at computing, just like those who are in the realm of religious submission.

There are people who have master's degrees, doctorates, even compose academies and great places in the field of technology and programming, and have an indoctrination. 
[02:38:53] <Kaiod> One knowledge does not eliminate the other or demotivate the other in this matter, they are different knowledge, even in different areas.

[02:57:37] <Kaiod> jkk: I don't understand what exactly it has to do with the question. I presented to you that programming is a knowledge, religiosity although it is also, involves a social and psychological concept. And therefore, a person is not bad at programming because he is religious.
[02:59:25] <jkk> 0 need to pretend
[02:59:32] <jkk> people here are not idiots Xd
[03:01:11] <Kaiod> jkk: Look, this was the analysis that I found in the technical preview, currently, it uses the code in a way that doesn't make logical sense many times, precisely because it is in the preview, and because it is an intelligence, you deduce that it learns from what you input.
[03:05:10] <Kaiod> <jkk> "people here are not idiots Xd" <- Nobody is pretending anything here, I am being sincere and direct with you. The point, is that you don't do the same, and try to respond in a rougher and shorter way, which doesn't create a healthy discussion (in my view and opinion). Because this is a global space for open debate on a centralized topic (free software, GNU and the like), I try to be precise in the information I tell you.

[05:08:06] <jxself> Should a campaign for abolishing child labor talk only about how valuable adult workers are to their employers, or how happy kids are when they don't work?
[05:08:41] <jxself> These may seem like outlandish comparisons but you can find people writing, only a couple centuries ago, about how slavery should be abolished by arguing in favor of the benefits of paid labor.
[05:08:56] <jxself> Even if the economic arguments in favor of paid work are strong, these arguments seem irrelevant and offensive today. Whether slavery is more or less efficient is a moot point. Society has rejected it because it is wrong.

[20:57:42] <tesseract> what do you guys think about microsoft pluton security chip?
[20:57:57] <tesseract> amd integrated it in their cpu

[21:22:50] <Aurora_v_kosmose> tesseract: My thought on the matter is that it's a horrible idea. It's also simply impossible to accomplish its stated goal without banning all interpreters & VMs like JVM & CLR from their platforms.
[21:23:15] <Aurora_v_kosmose> As a Python program can modify its code without modifying executable memory regions.

[21:25:10] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That's before someone manages to simply implement something that can serve a purpose equivalent to the UEFI shim.
[21:25:34] <Aurora_v_kosmose> User-space kernel would do perfectly fine. Hurd for 2022?
[21:25:46] <tesseract> so microsoft can remotely access if you have this chip?
[21:28:31] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That part remains problematic. I'm saying the claimed security improvement from attestation cannot work.
[21:29:37] <Aurora_v_kosmose> So there's effectively no real positive point about the thing, since the only positive thing it claims is trivially bypassed.
[21:31:57] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Unless they're willing to cripple their platform to that point.
[21:32:05] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That it's no longer usable.

[23:01:45] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That might cause them issues in the EU if it isn't.
[23:02:11] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That or they'll have to weaken their guarantees so much it'll be effectively useless.
