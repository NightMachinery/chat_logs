[01:11:23] <sd> 08<G‚Äãene> > REST has been employed throughout the software industry and is a widely accepted set of guidelines for creating stateless, reliable web APIs. A web API that obeys the REST constraints is informally described as RESTful. RESTful web APIs are typically loosely based on HTTP methods to access resources via URL-encoded parameters and the use of JSON or XML to transmit data.

[01:23:52] <PublicWiFi> How dumb of an idea would it be to get a second bachelor's lol
[01:23:59] <PublicWiFi> and get a degree in software development xD
[01:24:14] <JollyRgrs> @felda odd... but your phone most likely uses a fake (rnd) MAC unless you told it not to mask your MAC for your SSID
[01:24:29] <JollyRgrs> so it might be picking up like a KVM registered MAC or something
[01:24:44] <JollyRgrs> PublicWiFi: is that what you want to do?
[01:24:56] <DrGibby> maccas, its not silly, but what benefit will it give you?
[01:24:58] <PublicWiFi> I want to do more devops stuff
[01:25:05] <DrGibby> when do more devops stuff
[01:25:10] <DrGibby> s/when/then
[01:25:11] <layer8> DrGibby meant: "then do more devops stuff"
[01:25:12] <JollyRgrs> and obv. you understand that most companies dgaf what the degree is in, they just want "you have a 4 yr degree" (if they care) and then they want exp.
[01:25:13] <PublicWiFi> but its so hard to get your foot i nthe door if you do't work somewhere with that kind of thing already
[01:25:19] <DrGibby> homelab my dude
[01:25:25] <JollyRgrs> ^^
[01:25:30] <DrGibby> find ways to do it at work
[01:25:35] <JollyRgrs> i've always put my homelab stuff in my resumes
[01:25:42] <PublicWiFi> yeah but it's hard to say "sure I can work on your enterprise environment, I have homelab exp" :P
[01:25:43] <EmetSelch> labbing is the way
[01:25:50] <JollyRgrs> if anything, i show my well roundedness as I do all linux at home and do MSFT stuff at work
[01:26:00] <DrGibby> no sense on taking on additional debt to learn something that you can for free
[01:26:01] <JollyRgrs> PublicWiFi: no one will hire you as a Sr. with no exp
[01:26:04] <DrGibby> thats well documented even
[01:26:05] <JollyRgrs> but a Jr role? sure
[01:26:07] <sd> 12<h‚Äãxcsp> fuck a degree
[01:26:19] <EmetSelch> PublicWiFi: I'd see homelab as willingness to improve yourself and expand your horizons and knowledge
[01:26:22] <PublicWiFi> I guess my real question is.. can I find a jr role making the same or more than I do now lol
[01:26:34] * bomb makes love to his diploma
[01:26:34] <PublicWiFi> yeah I'm always messing with my homelab in some way
[01:26:44] <JollyRgrs> having other exp. in enterprise means you understand the pitfalls and differences between homelab and enterprise... you just gotta "be cautious" in enterprise
[01:26:51] <JollyRgrs> PublicWiFi: that's my issue
[01:26:55] <EmetSelch> JollyRgrs++
[01:27:06] <PublicWiFi> at least I have admin enterprise exp, so i get the idea of prod and being careful in general
[01:27:07] <sd> 12<h‚Äãxcsp> be cautious = change mgmt
[01:27:14] <JollyRgrs> i'm at the point where my current gig pays more than a more Jr role if i wanted to switch to devops or linux admin or whatnot
[01:27:22] <PublicWiFi> yeah that's a weird spot
[01:27:30] <PublicWiFi> but maybe the topout in devops would be more over time?
[01:27:35] <JollyRgrs> exactly... change mgmt and understanding WHY it is important (even if not ITIL or implemented at the company, you need to self-enforce those things)
[01:27:46] <PublicWiFi> I make 70k-ish so I bet a devops jr would be around there maybe?
[01:27:51] <sd> 12<h‚Äãxcsp> im in the same spot jolly
[01:28:02] <JollyRgrs> PublicWiFi: most likely... but how long until topout and is it worth the initial drop?
[01:28:14] <PublicWiFi> that's the question haha
[01:28:16] <JollyRgrs> PublicWiFi: probably wouldn't be far off... depending on size of company
[01:28:21] <DomLS3> Problem is going from sysadmin to devops even in a jr role would probably be tough considering sysadmin doesn't really have a whole lot of devops experience
[01:28:38] <JollyRgrs> PublicWiFi: now if you found a role that was sysadmin + a little devops...
[01:28:51] <JollyRgrs> you'd keep your same status (Sr., experienced, whatever) and get XP as well for devops
[01:28:58] <bomb> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGtVZgCYVgk
[01:29:04] <JollyRgrs> then you could move to a more Sr. devops role based on your exp. as a sysadmin+devopsjr
[01:29:20] <JollyRgrs> but... that means really hunting to find that role... or CREATING that role in your current job
[01:29:44] <DomLS3> "creating" that role in your current job = end up doing more work for no more money lol
[01:29:46] <JollyRgrs> i had to push to have a legit SCCM position created at my prev. job (they just did desktop lvl 2 titles for it previously)

[14:50:49] <Hunterkll> *shrug*
[14:50:50] <riff-IRC> or just convert to DVI or DP
[14:51:00] <Hunterkll> takes some research to find the right one
[14:51:05] <Hunterkll> won't work for HDCP content
[14:51:21] <Hunterkll> HDCP required content/applications will refuse to display / black square on screen
[14:51:30] <riff-IRC> oh ok
[14:51:33] <Hunterkll> just like how streaming services black square if you use built in screenshotting tools they can detect 
[14:51:45] <Hunterkll> the whole point of HDCP is Output - Display direct negotiation 
[14:52:04] <Hunterkll> so if it can't negotiate to the device thinking it's the display, and that said display has the correct cryptographic chip/signatures/validation 
[14:52:07] <Hunterkll> then the software fucks off

[14:53:38] <Hunterkll> so even though the splitter can receive the content just fine and pass it out, it'll refuse to output to non-HDCP negotiating displays...... at least, that's how it's supposed to work ;)
[14:54:30] <riff-IRC> yea
[14:54:53] <riff-IRC> HDCP-protected source -> cheap Chinese splitter -> capture card + TV
[14:55:04] <Hunterkll> don't really need the TV either 
[14:55:18] <riff-IRC> well if you want to see what's going on in realtime
[14:55:26] <Hunterkll> since some (not all) of the cheap chinese splitters appear to have forgotten the splitter output side check apparently.....
[14:55:32] <Hunterkll> well, i guess
[14:56:28] <Hunterkll> I mean, also, at the core, DVI and HDMI are almost identical really (hence just straight pinout adapters working) so that wouldn't help

[18:33:02] <signofzeta> Gotta love Linux.  "Complete Linux kernel and headers" will occupy an extra 2 KB.  If this were Windows, I'd need to free 6 GB of space.

[18:33:15] <Kiernian> 6?
[18:33:34] <signofzeta> Whoa, morning crew, you're already into some switching adventures
[18:33:35] <Kiernian> I think the last time I had to free up space for an update it needed an extra 32
[18:33:35] <PublicWiFi> fritzwastaken: AGGREGATE THE FUCK OUTTA THOSE LINKS BOI

[19:22:04] <PublicWiFi> ""Tankie" is a pejorative label for communists, particularly Stalinists, who support the authoritarian tendencies of Marxism‚ÄìLeninism."

[19:22:27] <vinrock> "According to The Independent, "
[19:22:30] <vinrock> aaaand i stopped there
[19:22:31] <monr0e> The actual definition is intended for the folks who are "more communist" than your average communist. The term comes from the Tiananmen square photo, and those in the umbrella are said to be the sort who would, knowing all the information possible, still be on the side of the Chinese army

[19:44:26] <PublicWiFi> not much
[19:44:37] <PublicWiFi> relative to your DB size I'd say
[19:44:44] <teh_f4ll3n> hmmm... or a generic k8s host and just containerise it
[19:45:40] <PublicWiFi> won't you need it to write to a DB though
[19:45:45] <PublicWiFi> I guess you can move the DB to another location

[19:51:42] <bomb> EmetSelch TW is annoying :(
[19:51:54] <onenerdyguy> Yeah, it's still 'supported' and 'developed' i guess

[19:52:12] <int0x1C8> s/swarm/

[19:52:28] <EmetSelch> easy rollback if update breaks something
[19:52:41] <EmetSelch> onenerdyguy: LOL, I moved my shit to K8s long ago
[19:52:49] <onenerdyguy> so did I
[19:52:59] <onenerdyguy> but the argument I got was "The team is dumb, and won't understand K8S"
[19:53:02] <onenerdyguy> and well. They're not wrong
[19:53:09] <int0x1C8> heh
[19:53:16] <EmetSelch> then send them to trainings or tell them to rtfm

[19:53:59] <bomb> EmetSelch yeah, you get the latest and greatest bugs :(

[23:21:57] <estranger> hey aws freaks.... how does EFS compare to EBS latency wise? my gut says EBS is lower latency?

[23:24:07] <estranger> 1) im working with a customer who says their cloud team wants to use EFS which I think is a dumb idea
[23:24:12] <estranger> 2) zero latency doesn't exist 
[23:24:38] <bomb> you are wrong and you should feel terrible
[23:24:38] <sd> 11<t‚Äãelgareith> do multiple compute slices need to access the data?
[23:26:25] <CptLuxx> fuck efs\
[23:29:20] <sd> 11<t‚Äãelgareith> whats wrong with efs
[23:29:52] <sd> 11<D‚ÄãTC> EFS is higher latency, but throughput is also quite limited.
[23:30:56] <sd> 11<D‚ÄãTC> EFS is basically an NFS managed by AWS
[23:31:06] <estranger> im not wrong
[23:31:23] <fritzwastaken> API vs Protocol...
[23:31:25] <estranger> DTC, that is what I thought... the cool thing wtih efs is you can  mount it to a bunch of instances.... which we dont need
[23:31:47] <estranger> bomb, and explain to me zero latency. because it doesn't exist 
[23:31:59] <estranger> even a local SSD has latency .... hell, local optane even
[23:32:17] <sd> 11<D‚ÄãTC> If you don‚Äôt need to mount it to multiple instances, then why are you considering EFS

[23:35:46] <sd> 11<D‚ÄãTC> There might be one other reason to use EFS but I can easily be wrong on this detail, and that‚Äôs if you are trying to get large GPU instances on EC2, and you can‚Äôt guarantee that a particular region will have the instance available, so you are trying to get the instance in multiple AZ‚Äôs. In which case EFS is a half decent solution to the problem.
[23:37:01] <estranger> man its just to run zookeeper .. nothing crazy, but disk latency is important

[23:37:55] <sd> 11<D‚ÄãTC> If disk latency is important and you only need 1 instance in 1 AZ to use the storage, then you definitely want EBS.
