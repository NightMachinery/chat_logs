[00:03:35] <OnlineCop> Your latest one, without the spaces or pipe:  ^(?=.*\d)(?=.*[a-zA-Z{}-])[a-zA-Z0-9{}-]{0,100}$
[00:03:55] <OnlineCop> One I suggested:  ^(?=[^\r\n\d]*\d)(?=.*[a-zA-Z{} |-])[a-zA-Z0-9{} |-]{0,100}$
[00:04:29] <OnlineCop> Although I have no idea why case sensitivity would be affecting either.
[00:05:35] <OnlineCop> Is this supposed to be matching GUIDs, like the example you have here? GUID ranges are hex: [0-9a-fA-F], not A-Z.
[00:06:32] <OnlineCop> I'm assuming GUIDs aren't the only thing this should match, since you're using a {0,100} range.

[09:45:14] <re101-grouse-14> the latest one looks good..just one more question
[09:45:15] <re101-grouse-14> how can I consider a leading space into the the word?
[09:50:58] <digitok> 07, ^.*?(?=PAGE BREAKER)
[09:51:37] <digitok> 07thomas25, ^.*?(?=PAGE BREAKER)
[09:59:00] <thomas25> digitok i've tried something very similar but failed, yours works (almost perfectly)
[09:59:02] <thomas25> https://regex101.com/r/lHzbTS/1
[09:59:11] <thomas25> there are these null matches
[09:59:58] <thomas25> maybe i should just use String.split() to roughly extract pages and then do proper regex in those pages
[10:00:06] <thomas25> regex is probably not the best tool for this kind of page extraction
[10:04:27] <purplex> you need to remove the group (\d+) -> \d+
[10:06:11] <digitok> i think they want to capture that
[10:06:36] <digitok> i do not think lookahead is needed here

[10:10:33] <thomas25> regex is funny, it's perfectly understandable when you are writing it yourself... but when reading someone elses, it requires much more effort!

[10:14:56] <digitok> hehe
[10:15:00] <purplex> so true, which is why people find it complex from the start
[10:16:23] <purplex> the /s version seems interesting, https://regex101.com/r/lHzbTS/4 i don't use it often with /s 
[10:17:39] <purplex> except for 1 million+ steps
[10:21:14] <purplex> it could be https://regex101.com/r/lHzbTS/5 but making a lot of groups consume more
[10:21:57] <thomas25> yeah, and i was lazy and premature optimizer (mabye rightfully so when in the old days) but nowadays i feel like i can relay anything to regex unless it is a critical section of the code (especially if it is a self tool)
[10:22:23] <thomas25> i was lazy as in i never took time to learn it, being exposed to it a few times a year, got me learn it a bit
[10:22:51] <thomas25> looks like my next frontier in regex will be lookaheads :D
[10:23:07] <thomas25> i knew i needed lookaheads for this case but couldn't make it work
[10:23:16] <thomas25> btw https://regex101.com/r/1qYROG/1
[10:24:06] <thomas25> it works perfectly but what if I want to match the "R,w (C; Ctr)" just before the block of interest, just to make the matching more strict (and catch possible errors in the long run)
[10:24:34] <thomas25> i.e. first match the block only then perform the data extraction (freq ranges and other values)
[10:25:01] <thomas25> or is it even a good idea to do that part in regex? maybe it'd be better to just do a string search to find the offset of the block and go from there
[10:28:42] <digitok> you would probably do it in 2 steps with regex
[10:28:59] <digitok> match the 4 lines and then use your current regex on that result
