[03:19:33] <MrElendig> and what for?
[03:20:08] <MrElendig> root on nfs/samba? remote unlocking of an encrypted volume? irc? ssh?
[03:20:15] <acidsys> i use a program in initramfs which unlocks disks using a key transferred over the network. I want to port it to arch linux, but arch linux uses mkinitcpio, which does not use the same functions as the legacy initramfs
[03:20:22] <dostoyevsky2> rcf: nah, I only use windows via qemu or wine ;-)
[03:20:37] <MrElendig> isn't really a singular legacy initramfs
[03:20:43] <MrElendig> every distro did their own thing
[03:21:24] <MrElendig> and there are some custom hooks for remote key unlocks
[03:22:02] <MrElendig> eg https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dm-crypt/Specialties#Remote_unlocking_of_the_root_(or_other)_partition
[03:22:03] <phrik> Title: dm-crypt/Specialties - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
[03:22:05] <acidsys> the initramfs-tools in i.e. ubuntu come with a function "configure_networking" using ifconfig. the net hook in initcpio seems to require passing kernel parameters for the ip configuration
[03:23:04] <acidsys> the solutions you suggest require the use of ssh for partial-automatic unlocking

[03:27:54] <acidsys> I employ systems with different operating systems. I am not implementing an Arch Linux specific solution. I was simply asking if someone happens to know if a function to configure networking automatically exists, like it does in initramfs, in order not having to pass ip= kernel parameters. If it doesn't exist, that's fine, but if it does, it makes it a bit easier

[07:57:42] <CodeSpelunker> the suggestion in posts online is to replace bubblewrap with bubblewrap-suid, and to delete ~/.cache/thumbnails/fail/
[07:57:56] <sheep> that is also what the arch wiki suggests

[07:58:04] <CodeSpelunker> but, no luck
[07:58:23] <CodeSpelunker> vqueiroz: I would look around online for some fontconfig setups
[07:58:27] <CodeSpelunker> that's what I did
[07:58:39] <vqueiroz> CodeSpelunker: What exactly are we talking about, preferred fonts?
[07:58:55] <CodeSpelunker> like an infinality replacement
[07:59:00] <sheep> also font options like what level of hinting to use and what sort of subpixel rendering

[07:59:18] <phrik> Title: Font configuration - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
[07:59:30] <CodeSpelunker> but for other stuff like font bolding like infinality did, you may need to build your own fontconfig I think

[08:00:35] <CodeSpelunker> any ideas?  maybe dmesg has something?

[08:01:52] <sheep> I don't think nautilus would use firejail

[08:02:26] <CodeSpelunker> dunno. how would I make an exception
[08:02:39] <CodeSpelunker> or like, how does gnome thumbnailer do its thing
[08:02:53] <CodeSpelunker> I don't even really know how exactly suid works
[08:03:46] <sheep> suid is just setuid, which means that the executable has the setuid bit, which means it runs as the user who owns it and not the user who executed it

[08:05:41] <Hydragyrum> but some things can prevent suid programs from executing as another user (i.e. setprivs --no-new-privs)
[08:05:58] <Hydragyrum> which I wouldn't be surprised to hear firejail using that
[08:06:10] <CodeSpelunker> yeah I think firejail is set to use that
[08:06:23] <CodeSpelunker> the no-new-privs thing
[08:06:35] <CodeSpelunker> nothing interesting in dmesg
[08:07:09] <Hydragyrum> for instance running sudo with it: ❯ setpriv --no-new-privs sudo
[08:07:09] <Hydragyrum> sudo: effective uid is not 0, is /usr/bin/sudo on a file system with the 'nosuid' option set or an NFS file system without root privileges?

[08:09:25] <sheep> does nautilus use firejail?
[08:09:32] <sheep> is it running in firejail?
[08:09:48] <CodeSpelunker> don't believe so
[08:10:00] <sheep> then why would firejail be relevant?
[08:10:42] <CodeSpelunker> whatever program nautilus uses to perform thumbnailing (bubblewrap, ffmpegthumbnailer) might
[08:11:12] <sheep> bubblewrap is another sandboxing thing, but I think nautilus runs the thumbnailer in that
[08:11:59] <CodeSpelunker> also no idea how that works with firejail lol

[12:48:54] <qin> switching to beta helped.

[20:11:39] <h4rd3n3D> dostoyevsky2:  wifi-menu is not, and has never been an Arch package.  The `wifi-menu` command is provided after installing `netctl`.  I have nothing to do with Arch *.iso development, so hunt for suspects elsewhere ;p
[20:13:33] <another|> h4rd3n3D recommended NM on your *installed* system. The ISO does, AFAIK, not have NM installed. 
[20:14:15] <another|> and always read the current installation guide because things change
[20:14:40] <h4rd3n3D> ^both correct :D
[20:15:01] <thrice> It is curious that the iso swapped to iwd, instead of nm

[23:29:48] <obby> evil maid is coming to get us
[23:29:52] <tatsumaru> jelle how can you predict your threat model in advance?
[23:30:10] <tatsumaru> isn't it up to your attackers to come up with a threat model
[23:30:15] <jelle> tatsumaru: no
[23:30:23] <rcf> tatsumaru: if you don't have a threat model, you can't defend against anything and are wasting your time. 
[23:30:42] <rcf> You must know what you are up against if you want to be able to justify even turning the machine on. 
[23:31:49] <rcf> And I actually mean that somewhat-seriously: after the system is running, disk encryption's value as a security measure evaporates completely. 
[23:32:52] <tatsumaru> well at the end of the day there's no perfect security, the whole idea is to just make things more difficult for problem-causers

[23:33:15] *** Joins: jonathon (~jx@user/jonathon)
[23:33:37] <NetSysFire> yes and it very much depends on your threat model
[23:33:39] <rcf> Indeed. So you must optimize based on what you're actually worried about, and consider whether or not it is worthwhile to worry about any given attack.

[23:34:34] <jelle> tatsumaru: lock your computer :)
[23:34:56] <NetSysFire> the best defense against everything is throwing your computer into a volcano. that makes it very secure
[23:35:35] <tatsumaru> NetSysFire maybe they can rearrange the atoms with a quantum replicator of some sort
[23:35:42] <NetSysFire> maybe
[23:35:49] <Tamwyn> NetSysFire: the cloud backups are still at risk

[23:35:53] <demize> Alternatively, make some thermite.

[23:36:11] <tatsumaru> the best way to stay secure is to stay mediocre
[23:36:18] <NetSysFire> you can also put your device next to a toddler
[23:36:26] <NetSysFire> that erases any data of it reliably and it cant be recovered
[23:36:29] <rcf> NetSysFire: this actually exposes vulnerabilities

[23:36:33] <NetSysFire> yeah
[23:36:37] <NetSysFire> i remember that screenlocker bug
[23:36:39] <drop> Just become a Mentat. Is hacking Mentats a thing in the Dune universe?
[23:36:42] <demize> Unless the toddler is a Russian spy.
[23:36:46] <tatsumaru> can babies decrypt drives?
[23:36:51] <NetSysFire> yes
[23:36:52] <rcf> NetSysFire: there has been more than one, as jwz is fond of ranting about.

[23:36:59] <NetSysFire> yeah
[23:37:04] <Gagis> proposed threat model that you actually see happen: former middle manager who has been hired by a competitor but someone forgot to remove their login credentials. will competitor know what your clients have been buying?
[23:37:09] <NetSysFire> a cat is an excellent fuzzer
[23:37:36] <obby> <3
[23:37:39] <Gagis> (yes, because every upper managers password is 1234, but hypothetically)
[23:38:29] <NetSysFire> the worst thing is when i am in bed and have my laptop on my lap and the cat too and its fur touches the touchpad and constantly sends weird mouse events
[23:38:46] <obby> i cleared the cmos on my servers motherboard and it erased my efi options been too lazy to fix it need motivation
[23:39:07] <tatsumaru> NetSysFire let's create a startup for dna-sensitive touchpads which filter out cat dna
[23:39:20] <NetSysFire> excellent idea

[23:57:40] <Steve37> Anyone here know what's going on with the package python-sqlalchemy? The version currently in community is very out of date (and flagged as such) and the newer version is in staging. Just wondering what's being staged and if there's an ETA on it arriving. I need some features that were introduced in the new version.
[23:58:12] <thrice> staging is usually for rebuilds that need to happen all together
[23:58:46] <thrice> you likely won't find an ETA, it's whenever the volunteer packager has time to updat.e  If you need it sooner, you could consider building it locally
