[13:00:19] <meff[m]> I learned it just enough to setup a Matrix bridging bot 😛
[13:00:31] <enterprisey> some servers use roles as an "about me" sort of section

[13:02:19] <meff[m]> ooh yeah interesting enterprisey

[13:27:10] <enterprisey> or maybe it was a joke I didn't get
[13:32:14] <naansequitur> ah you're right, I've never actually spent more than a second thinking about that

[13:33:06] <enterprisey> on one hand, yes
[13:33:19] <gerikson> I believe it is technically correct
[13:33:26] <enterprisey> on the other, I instinctively wrote "weechat plugin for matrix" above, even though by LSW rules it should be "matrix plugin for weechat"
[13:34:53] <enterprisey> the problem is in "X plugin for Y", obviously X is the primary sort of thing and Y is the secondary target of the thing, but if someone builds a plugin for something, there's confusion about whether the platform is the primary sort of thing or the secondary target for the thing

[16:21:58] <inherently> didn't matrix make some change fairly recently that stopped it from being as annoying here?
[16:22:23] <c355e3b> IIRC No
[16:22:34] <dgold> can't say as I've noticed any difference
[16:22:58] <c355e3b> rudi, I would say keep pushing on the bridge authors to make sure that they really understand the other side of the UX
[16:23:21] <c355e3b> E.g. I get an "extended message" as a link to a pastbin asking me for an invite in a pm
[16:23:22] <dgold> tbh, I don't understand why the admins, first @ freenode then @ libera, are so accomodating of matrix-bridge

[18:51:31] <ychaouche> o/
[18:53:29] <ychaouche> fellow lobsters, I have libfreetype6 version 2.5 on my old system, and teamviewer15 for linux needs libfreetype6 2.6. I have downloaded the library, but I don't want to break my system by installing it. I would like to run teamviewer15 with that version of the library by tweaking LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
[18:55:01] <cb> ....what distro are you on?
[18:55:32] <ychaouche> so I changed to the directory that contains the new library, did export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. , then ran teamviewer15. strace shows that it still can't find the library at ./libfreetype.so.6
[18:55:37] <kline> ychaouche, you have something like ~/bin which is your local scripts and tools, early in your PATH right? if so, drop a shell script in there called teamviewer and have it do LD_LIBRARY_PATH or LD_PRELOAD and call /parth/to/teamviewer
[18:56:50] <ychaouche> I have doubts concerning the interpretation of "." in LD_LIBRARY_PATH : is it the pwd of the shell running the program, or is it the path to the program ?
[18:57:27] <ychaouche> for example, if teamviewer is at /opt/bin/teamviewer and I run it from /home/ychaouche/lib/, will . be /home/ychaouche/lib or /opt/bin/teamviewer ?
[18:57:35] <kline> does making it an absolute path fix the problem?
[18:57:43] <ychaouche> will try
[18:57:45] <rudi> ychaouche: I'd try with "LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/libreetype.so.6 teamviewer15" (give an absolute path and add the variable only for the program invocation)
[18:58:05] <ychaouche> rudi: good idea
[18:58:37] <rudi> also check the output of "ldd teamviewer15", maybe it needs some more libraries
[18:59:00] <ychaouche> rudi: kline: absolute path fixes the problem
[18:59:18] <dsc_> also run `sudo ldconfig`  if you have shuffled around libraries and paths, it reloads the linker cache

[19:26:46] <wink> ychaouche: yes, ldd is for looking, but it will often guide you to the solution,
[19:28:53] <wink> ychaouche: also for completeness, sudo ldconfig should only "fix what might be wrongly cached", unless you added anything in /etc. maybe that's what dsc_ meant. after any install of systemwide-libs, it *can* be the easier solution (or rebooting will fix it). it should never account for anything in your home, unless you added that in /etc somewhere

[19:49:47] <rudi> creature: I find calibre to be clunky in the GUI but mostly painless, and the directory structure is ok.  2-level (Author -> book name), kept in sync with the metadata displayed in the program.  Dunno what happens when you rename directories, I always renamed the author / book title within calibre instead

[20:02:21] <JordiGH> I think Eqonomize is more flexible but also more complicated.
