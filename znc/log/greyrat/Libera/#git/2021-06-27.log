So I got frustrated and deleted the fork and re forked. Now it looks like my previous branches are lost and I cannot find a way to edit my pull requests...

[16:59:42] <NeatNit> hi again, I'm trying to set up my Raspberry Pi as a private git server for collaborating with a friend. I managed to get git working as desired using just SSH, based on the book https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-Getting-Git-on-a-Server but now the big hurdle for me is to get Git LFS working (which is required for us).
[16:59:58] *** Quits: Adoi (~Adoi@user/adoi) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[17:00:17] <NeatNit> Does anyone have any experience/advice for setting up small-scale, local storage based Git LFS?
[17:01:27] <NeatNit> I've found this list https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/wiki/Implementations but I get lost trying to read most of them. Lots of uses of acronyms I don't understand, stuff like that...
[17:03:48] *** Joins: computeiro (~Wender@189.37.69.243)
[17:07:41] <mackerman> NeatNit: Those are software options for the application providing a  LFS API.
[17:08:15] <mackerman> Where to store the objects is a seperate question as many of the LFS servers have various object storage options.
[17:11:22] <mackerman> I do not have experience implementing such a thing.
[17:12:31] *** Joins: feriman (~feriman@188.163.113.127)
[17:13:21] <mackerman> But I gather one decision is:  is the storage local, or are you storing it in some cloud?
[17:14:06] <mackerman> Second, for local storage, does regular files makes sense, or are you implmenting a local object storage  like with Minio?
