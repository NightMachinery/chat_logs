[00:52:42] <gilberth> I mean, this doesn't make sense at. Germany was about to buy yet more natural gas by Russia. With it shutting down its nuclear plants and its coal plants in the near future. Plan was to burn natural gas for electricity.

[01:27:25] <selwyn> the same liberals who would cringe at reports of muslims taking local jobs in europe
[01:27:44] <selwyn> are happy to believe that the yellow peril will endanger the russian far east
[01:28:07] <selwyn> personally i suspect that discord between russians and chinese is highly exaggerated
[01:28:36] <waleee> not discord, but it's pretty clear that the chinese benefits way more
[01:29:21] <selwyn> i guess
[01:29:25] <shka> selwyn: it is not about discord, it is about opportunity
[01:29:36] <selwyn> though much like russia itself, china has a hell of a lot of land
[01:29:43] <selwyn> internal frontier is still a factor there

[01:30:18] <waleee> selwyn: lots of it in the north of China and the inland has drought problems

[01:30:33] <shka> russia is rapidly loosing it's value in alliance anyway
[01:32:11] <selwyn> they might take a junior role
[01:32:18] <shka> i mean, nobody is going to consider Russia diplomatic sanctions for a long time
[01:33:07] <shka> well, they might, but it is about what you are going to put into your ally vs what you can get out of him
[01:33:43] <shka> and right now it seems that Russia won't have much to offer in return but it already demonstrated that it tends to cause headache 
[01:34:06] <selwyn> what headaches has russia caused china
[01:34:07] <shka> so their value is limited to more USA in europe, less in asia
[01:34:31] <shka> selwyn: it generates headaches for the west, not china
[01:34:41] <selwyn> oh right
[01:35:14] <shka> but i guess it kinda interferes with china business interests in the ukraine 
[01:35:45] <shka> it would probably be less of a problem if russian army would accomplish what Putin hoped it would do
[01:35:48] <selwyn> before the war, china hoovered up a ukrainian aerospace company on the cheap
[01:35:58] <selwyn> don't see why that wouldn't continue
[01:36:41] <selwyn> plenty of assets to be sold
[01:37:58] <shka> well, if Russia would occupy Ukraine, it becomes a problem
[01:40:32] <shka> overall, i guess China is simply shifting it's assessment of Russia's value  
[01:41:29] <shka> it is not longer very useful ally, but it is useful as a... uh... holding

[08:40:42] <kakuhen> so im in the middle of a huge refactoring of my flac decoder and uh
[08:40:57] <kakuhen> i appreciate dynamic types so much more now when im prototyping code
[08:41:18] <kakuhen> I can just declare a bunch of slots in a class, get some code that actually does what I intend, then add typing later
[08:41:54] <kakuhen> back then i would force myself to type all of my slots beforehand, and it would sometimes stop me from quickly writing code
[08:42:38] <kakuhen> i also learned that CCL on its default safety level does not enforce type checks whereas SBCL does
[08:43:04] <kakuhen> CCL won't complain about nil not being an integer until you (declaim (optimize (safety 3))), SBCL will complain in safety 2
[08:43:38] <kakuhen> so in place of (declare (type foo bar)) in my function decls, I am now using check-type for consistency across impls in default safety levels
[08:44:18] <semz> According to the standard, violating a type declaration is simply undefined behavior.
[08:44:56] <kakuhen> yeah, CCL in particular will coerce nil to 0 or something, based on what I've seen in my functions
[08:45:00] <kakuhen> so flac has some quasi utf-8 encoding for frame numbers
[08:45:09] <kakuhen> passing it to nil will make CCL return 0 for the function, in default safety value
[08:45:29] <kakuhen> SBCL will signal an error, and CCL will signal error with safety 3. Both signal errors if you use check-type in place of declare
[08:46:00] <kakuhen> passing nil to the decoding function*
[08:48:43] <semz> One important and slightly unintuitive thing to keep in mind when you add type checks but also want type declarations is that (defun foo (bar) (declare (type bar-type bar)) (check-type bar bar-type) ...) is not correct. When bar is not of type bar-type, the declaration is already violated before you ever reach check-type.
[08:49:18] <kakuhen> i see; for now i am only using check-type
[08:49:40] <kakuhen> i know it has a performance penalty, which is probably why CCL ignores enforcement in safety 2
[08:50:05] <kakuhen> but im assuming that inlining the functions will speed up my program
[08:52:43] <semz> For what it's worth, SBCL should already use check-type for optimization and if all else fails, you can always do (defun foo (bar) (check-type ...) (locally (declare (type ...)) ...)) instead.
[09:01:00] <moon-child> #+type-checking (defmacro mcheck-type (&rest a) `(check-type ,@a)) #-type-checking (defmacro mcheck-type (&rest a) nil)

[10:48:54] <moon-child> (defmethod (setf accessor) :after ...)?
[10:49:03] <kakuhen> yeah that sounds right
[10:49:55] <kakuhen> in my great flac-decode rewrite i am writing a proper bit reader
[10:49:59] <kakuhen> it's a lot harder than i expected...
[10:50:38] <kakuhen> in short, I created a proxy object for my binary stream; it holds the underlying binary stream, a buffer byte, and an index
[10:51:34] <kakuhen> then there is a READ-BITS function which takes an integer and this proxy object. everything's fine if n <= available-bits; once available-bits = 0, it consumes the next byte of the stream
[10:52:08] <kakuhen> rather than hard-coding a bunch of checks for index = 0, I'm checking after (setf index) if it becomes zero, which in case consume the next byte of the stream

[10:56:58] <kakuhen> this is what i have so far -- feel free to criticize my approach
[10:57:29] <kakuhen> i just figured that an after method on index isn't worth it, or rather, there's a more natural spot for what I am intending to do (the before method for getting remaining bits)

[14:59:59] <shka> well, they actually do care about manual memory layouts and the likes, also most GPU intensive stuff is still mostly done with C++
[15:00:21] <shka> so i am saying
[15:00:39] <shka> there is subset of C++ users that know that it is no-good, it is horrible in fact

[15:01:11] <moon-child> for gpus, cuda is, ok, yes
[15:01:49] <shka> well, you DONT need, sure, but C++ is explicitly designed around that
[15:02:07] <shka> which is a hindrance 99% of the time 
[15:02:13] <moon-child> if I had to use something like c++, I would use c
[15:02:17] <shka> but sometimes is actually useful 
[15:02:18] <moon-child> or d, in a pinch
[15:02:34] <shka> no, i would rather use C++ over C
[15:02:42] <hayley> If I had to use something like C++, I would become a professional busker.
[15:02:45] <moon-child> well, bully for you
[15:03:44] <shka> because with all it's flaws, C++ at least has destructors and i would rather use std::shared_ptr then bother with C style of reference counting
[15:04:07] <shka> also, C is also pretty horrible language honestly 
[15:04:10] <moon-child> if you care to carefully manage object layouts, then you had better also carefully manage object lifetimes

[15:17:46] <pl> isn't 1 bit RC pretty much for checking if you can drop the object without care or need to leave it for tracing?
[15:19:14] <hayley> Yes.
[15:20:25] <hayley> (Well, in a deferred RC setting you have to "trace" from the stack and roots periodically, but it is not transitive like a tracing GC. This is what leaves me interested in the idea, admittedly.)
[15:24:12] <hayley> But I should really study and see if any programs have sufficiently few circular references, and do usually have small reference counts. Else the idea falls flat.

[15:40:01] <hayley> Ouch!
[15:40:46] <pl> Lots of Schadenfreude on my side, because they are burning cycles due to C++ manual management of memory

[15:42:39] * hayley grumbles
[15:43:36] <hayley> pl: Is it malloc itself, or actions related to making manual management work? Another allocator may help with the former.
[15:44:11] <hayley> The story with Mastodon was that you could save like 50% on RAM usage by making Ruby use another allocator.
[15:45:07] <pl> hayley: all the way from class allocator to VM page layout 
[15:45:27] <hayley> Well.
[15:45:58] * hayley still needs to write a not-bump-allocator for practise.
[15:46:32] <pl> It's a forking server design, and one of the issues they caught is lots of minor page faults per query setup 
[15:47:44] <hayley> Is forking a good idea still? I'd guess any page reuse across forked/original processes leads to faults.
[15:48:14] <pl> Writes to reused pages so, that's also under consideration 
[15:48:24] <hayley> So, might not help to use a GC still.
[15:48:38] <hayley> Right, it's the writes.

[17:04:19] <selwyn> pl is right
[17:07:00] <selwyn> shka: if ukraine becomes afghanistan, then presumably poland gets to be pakistan in the 80s
[17:07:03] <selwyn> it won't be fun at all
[17:07:23] <shka> no
[17:07:41] <shka> and the whole Putinist Russia is finished
[17:07:59] <shka> so the only sensible way for Russia to do is to retreat from Ukraine
[17:08:05] <selwyn> these are famous last words
[17:08:37] <selwyn> turkey spent 10 years funding an insurgency with nato help not too distantly in the past
[17:08:54] <selwyn> as it turns out, the other side had plenty of fight, and turkey got to host > 3 million refugees
[17:14:04] <selwyn> pl: what makes you say the usa expects 20 years of insurgency
[17:15:49] <pl> selwyn: before events of 2013/2014, Ukraine, including ethnical Russians (Ukraine is multi-ethnic), didn't have strong feelings against Russia
[17:16:47] <pl> The revolutions of 2004 and 2014 were targeted more against being puppet of Russian oligarchs (at least that was the perception) combined with wanting to join more with EU. It was much less of, let's say, national identity thing
[17:18:13] <pl> Now they have 8 years of war behind them (I've seen estimates that they have close to half a million combat veterans, with training etc.) and Putin finally does a large scale invasion where it's widely understood that he wants to "Russify" them.
[17:18:41] <pl> selwyn: Consider the fact that Kharkiv has /majority of Russian ethnicity/
[17:18:58] <shka> ... and is shelled by Russians right now
[17:19:09] <pl> (hell, Zelensky is from ethnically russian area and those areas heavily voted for him)
[17:19:20] <pl> yeah, Kharkiv is /fucking pissed/
[17:20:37] <pl> we're talking second largest ukrainian city, with ridiculous amount of ties with russian population all over Russia (it was, among other things, a center of Soviet space and strategic rocket program, I think it was second biggest concentration for those industries after Moscow oblast itself!)
[17:20:44] <shka> it is like France would try to invade and destroy Belgium
[17:21:06] <pl> And before they got shelled they were already pretty much all pissed and ready to fight to bitter end against Russians
[17:21:29] <selwyn> but does the usa say this
[17:21:37] <pl> Now add that they have national myth for partisans, etc.
[17:21:49] <pl> selwyn: I don't know details of the analysis that led to published claims
[17:21:54] <selwyn> ok
[17:22:08] <pl> but I can give you what anyone with basic idea of the area can tell you
[17:22:18] <shka> i don't think that USA even understands Ukrainians and Russians all that well
[17:22:30] <selwyn> shka: it doesn't
[17:22:55] <pjb> shka: well, if the flanders sent bombs onto Wallonia, perhaps France could be motivated to invade Belgium, and neutralize Flander. Perhaps even it would recognize an independent Wallonia, or annex it, given a strongly majoritarian referendum.
[17:23:07] <pl> it still probably has better sources there than in Middle East
[17:23:20] <shka> pjb: back to ignore list with you
[17:23:21] <pl> and it now has to deal with cooperating population, unlike before
[17:23:52] <pjb> shka: The only reason why we don't annex Wallonia already, is because we don't want to kill the goose that lays golden eggs (in terms of artists and artistic output).
[17:24:35] <shka> anyway, thing is, Putin was actually right to say that Ukrainians are like brothers to Russians
[17:24:45] <shka> but he managed to turn them into bitter enemies
[17:25:14] <selwyn> pl: there are plenty of populations in the middle east who cooperated with america
[17:25:18] <selwyn> and they got sold down the river
[17:25:22] <selwyn> not an encouraging precedent
[17:25:55] <pl> selwyn: slightly different approaches, even if they get sold
[17:26:12] <pl> I mean, Western Betrayal is probably something Ukrainians are pretty well aware
[17:26:24] <pl> they got appeasement pushed on them for last decade or so
[17:26:32] <shka> my impression is that americans want to stay in the background this time
[17:28:19] <shka> anyway, this thing either drags forever or Putin is put out of his misery
[17:30:05] <shka> hopefully the second scenario can happen 
[17:31:02] <shka> i pick polonium poisoning as favorable outcome
[17:32:32] <contrapunctus> shka: whatever happened to "changes his mind (possibly persuaded by mounting losses)"?
[17:33:15] <shka> i have no idea, i know that right now the quickest way to end is removing putin from power
[17:33:35] <shka> whatever his successor would be, he will be far less likely to continue with this war
[17:33:46] <selwyn> hm
[17:36:10] <selwyn> apparently soviet cities were designed to make urban guerilla defence difficult
[17:36:12] <selwyn> til
[17:36:44] <shka> make no mistake, even without Putin, Russians are still nationalistic and imperialistic 
[17:37:14] <shka> but right now this war is pointless
[17:39:11] <shka> and after 20 years of putin and surkov  their society is weak
[17:41:08] <selwyn> i just don't see who will do logistics or funding for an insurgency
[17:41:25] <selwyn> as shka says the americans are in the background
[17:41:42] <selwyn> nato doesn't want to get involved

[20:29:57] <shka> White_Flame: they were designed with a lifespan in mind, you could retrofit it to go further still, but that's still costly
[20:30:26] <White_Flame> is that lifetime being reached
[20:30:28] <White_Flame> ?
[20:31:01] <shka> i don't know when those were constructed,but usually 50 years of lifespan is what designers used to aim for
[20:31:47] <shka> i personally think that it is a prime time for European SMR cooperation
[20:31:57] <White_Flame> afaik, all those closures were mostly post-fukushima paranoia
[20:32:20] <shka> R&R already is working on one, so this could be incorporate into a consortium
[20:32:24] <shka> airbus style
[20:32:44] <White_Flame> wouldn't be a bad idea.  or, finally get sahara solar projects going
[20:33:06] <shka> sahara solar is a weird idea that smell a little bit colonial
[20:33:36] <shka> also, we should keep as much as humanly possibly in Europe of our critical infastructure 
[20:33:41] <White_Flame> europe had been looking at that in the past
[20:34:44] <shka> i think that UK, France, Germany as senior partners for SMR project would be good for everyone in Europe 
[20:35:08] <shka> heck, we can invite Hitachi as well
[20:35:14] <selwyn> you are not wrong
[20:35:17] <selwyn> but forget about the uk
[20:35:34] <shka> you guys not so hot for international cooperation?
[20:36:08] <selwyn> i dont think so
[20:36:22] <shka> you are making me sad
[20:36:37] <selwyn> it would probably be more attractive for the government to do a national project 
[20:36:46] <selwyn> but i don't have particular insight into how they think
[20:37:15] <selwyn> someone who was in a position to know, did tell me that the rolls royce led smr consortium 
[20:37:20] <shka> well, anyway, one standardized, mass produced reactor would be a one solid step forward
[20:37:29] <selwyn> was not taken seriously by them, and just an attempt to hoover up some funding
[20:37:42] <shka> and European Consortium model kinda worked out fine in the past
[20:38:37] <shka> we would still need more of nuclear infrastructure to make this truly good, but it would be a good start
[20:39:08] <selwyn> if your thinking is that the war will focus europe on itself
[20:39:25] <shka> well, it should
[20:39:33] <selwyn> then i would say it is not clear yet what impact the war has on uk strategic thinking (to the extent that the uk has a strategy)
[20:39:51] <shka> Europe has a lot of problems right now, but it also means to resolve those problems
[20:39:51] <selwyn> nevertheless, i don't think that the uk will react in a spirit of solidarity at all
[20:40:19] <selwyn> thats what the preliminary signs mean to be at the moment anyway
[20:40:28] <selwyn> * mean to me
[20:40:46] <ck_> White_Flame: re/post-fukushima paranoia, that's not the main reason as far as I know, there has been a general anti-nuclear-energy trend in politics before that event
[20:41:25] <selwyn> remember it was not too long ago that large parts of this country believed that the eu was a kind of bumbling late-era ussr that could easily be defeated by a quick witted opponent
[20:42:35] <selwyn> priority so far is keeping ukrainians out of normal island
[20:52:24] <selwyn> ah yes, and the latest is that they won't seize football clubs
[20:52:34] <selwyn> because the clubs could close
[20:52:44] <White_Flame> ck_: right, and the fukushima tipped the scales for them
[20:52:48] <White_Flame> *then
[20:53:12] <White_Flame> I was not under the impression that the nuclear generators were reaching end of life
[20:54:05] <selwyn> shka: so you see, britain is not inconveniencing itself
[20:56:14] <shka> well, you guys are weird 
[20:56:47] <ck_> White_Flame: I don't know the dates yet, but I'd have guessed that we are coming up on the 50 years previously mentioned in this decade

[20:57:51] <ck_> okay I was one decade off, apparently most came online in the 80s and 90s
[21:01:12] <Lycurgus> bbs?
[21:02:18] <Lycurgus> or online services generally maybe
[21:03:12] <Lycurgus> which initially were dial up/in
[21:05:01] <Lycurgus> and actually some were online in late 70s (e.g. lockheed dialog) but not for the general public
[21:05:31] <ck_> Lycurgus: nuclear power plants
[21:06:14] <Lycurgus> ah
[21:06:35] <Lycurgus> those obviously were online before the 80s
[21:06:43] <Lycurgus> e.g. 3 mile island
[21:07:24] <Lycurgus> by which time nuclear power plants were about 15 yo
[21:08:50] <gilberth> Well. Fukushima triggered to abandon nuclear energy again. After a previous plan to get out of nuclear was cancelled. It's a cancel of a cancel of an initial cancel of nuclear. For the most part because it was feared that for Fukushima the Green party would gain yet more votes. The roots of the Green party are in anti-nuclear protests.
[21:09:55] <gilberth> And yes, this strong anti-nuclear movement was going on for decades since the 80s.
[21:09:56] <Lycurgus> 3 mi island, chernobyl, fukushima, it would be dead if it weren't for climate change and stuff
[21:11:22] <Lycurgus> bill gates is still pushing it last I knew
[21:13:14] <gilberth> Lycurgus: See. More people died from coal power. Chernobyl made me as a student still in school dig the issue. And I said then, what I say today: Burning fossil fuel is way worse. More people die from that and we may change our climate with severe effects. The latter with certainty.
[21:16:22] <shka> total causality of 3 mile island is 0 
[21:16:35] <gilberth> But this is a psychological effect. One drastic sudden disaster is perceived as worse as a slow and certain disaster happening costing more lives. This is like with traffic. If a plane crashes with hundreds dying its in the news, all those that are die in car traffic every day are not in the news. We got used to the latter.
[21:16:59] <shka> yeah, but imagine buying flying
[21:17:04] <shka> *banning
[21:17:46] <gilberth> There are people who are afraid of entering a plane, but won't hesitate to enter an automobile.
[21:17:47] <shka> anyway, nuclear reactors are like any other machines
[21:18:44] <shka> they can be dangerous, but fuck, at least they don't literally risk civilization collapse on the long scale 
[21:18:59] <gilberth> Also: There is no ideal solution. Every technology has its adverse effects. Even wind turbines have.
[21:19:03] <shka> and internal combustion engines of all kinds do
[21:19:49] <shka> also, not getting your energy out of political unstable places is a good thing
[21:19:55] <copec> Although not an argument against gun control in the states, there is the same thing with mass shootings
[21:20:27] <shka> American gun culture is different thing
[21:20:51] <gilberth> I'd really like to show Green party members a documentation about how rare earth are mined and ask them what they think about being all for raising the demand. I fear they aren't even aware.
[21:20:53] <Alfr> gilberth, so, we just need to find a way to spread out the death toll a bit.
[21:21:03] <shka> weapon ownership is ingrained in their culture ever since inception of their country 
[21:21:55] <gilberth> Alfr: Coal power spreads that fine. The death toll is global. You can't hide from climate change.
[21:22:34] <Alfr> gilberth, I'm referring to nuclear, so that it'll find more acceptance.
[21:22:43] <shka> also, how racists is cooking Africa and India with European CO2 emissions
[21:22:51] <copec> My point is, many more people die from their diet, or alcohol, than mass shootings, but those aren't nearly as scary 
[21:23:00] <copec> Same thing with a nuclear power plant melting down
[21:23:07] <gilberth> Alfr: Germany and nuclear is a lost cause. I am not holding my breath.
[21:24:06] <gilberth> copec: Many people die from soft drinks.
[21:24:17] <shka> ah, yes, the sugary water
[21:24:27] <shka> the worst invention of the mankind :P
[21:24:31] <Lycurgus> gilberth, aye, and France hasn't seemed to have had any probs
[21:24:57] <gilberth> Lycurgus: with sugar or with nuclear power?
[21:25:03] <Lycurgus> nuclear
[21:25:16] <shka> they have a lot of problems with sugar xD
[21:25:19] <copec> nuclear sugar
[21:25:37] <gilberth> Well, some plants right near the German border at not in their best shape.
[21:25:57] <Lycurgus> sugar too, but they may be slipping there as their obesity rates are rising to comparable levels of the other fatty countries
[21:26:10] <Lycurgus> prolly as they reduce the cigs
[21:26:32] <gilberth> But then France is clever. When the plant sits at the border, where does the fall out go? With west wind most of the time? ;)
[21:29:05] <gilberth> And as said here. I too believe, SMR is the only option we have to stop climate change. Time is running out. Failing that we need to consider geo-engineering.
[21:30:14] <copec> There are thousands of thermal vents in the middle of the oceans in between the continents, we could geothermal them
[21:30:20] <gilberth> The pro-argument I read is like: If Airbus or Boeing could manufacture one air liner a day, so we could manufacture one SMR a day.
[21:31:14] <shka> gilberth: not quite this simple, but yeah, serial production is actually possible 
[21:31:53] <gilberth> shka: I have not said it would be simple. But, I believe "mass" production will be cheaper and faster.
[21:31:56] <shka> we already constructed highly precise machines en masse 
[21:32:24] <shka> gilberth: my example is the ship building
[21:32:37] <Alfr> copec, being located out in and beneath oceans makes those quite impractical for power generation.
[21:33:07] <copec> We just need to put some straws together
[21:33:08] <shka> right now China literally constructs ships in number that would be sufficient for the current state of UK Royal Navy
[21:33:12] <shka> EVERY YEAR
[21:33:20] <gilberth> shka: Just some hull for the most part. But yes, those ships are huge these days.
[21:33:51] * gilberth was thinking about freighters or tankers.
[21:34:09] <shka> well, those need to be constructed very precisely as well
[21:35:44] <shka> so anyway, building even the most complex machines rapidly is certainly possible 
[21:36:33] <shka> and you can add renewable on top of that for generating hydrogen and what not
[21:38:56] <pjb> gilberth: 1- it's not a question of border but of water. 2- if you had accepted the Saar referendum, the border wouldn't be there, but farther.  The water would still be at the same place!

[22:33:24] <vms14> strange as clisp is not the fastest implementation
[22:33:36] <vms14> was it async?
[22:34:22] <gilberth> CLISP has odd performance characteristics as a lot of CL is written in C.
[22:34:31] <edgar-rft> it wasn't even compiled because the early-2000s internet connection was the main bottleneck
[22:34:56] <selwyn> clisp might have been one of the faster implementations at the time
