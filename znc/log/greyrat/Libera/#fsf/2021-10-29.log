[20:17:59] <leah> it fixes damaged mp4 files. this saved my ass once, when i recorded a bunch of footage but it got corrupted
[20:18:10] <leah> adding to FSD now
[20:19:48] <leah> i actually emailed the author personally, to thank him for his fine work
[20:19:54] <Noisytoot> leah, irc://https://web.libera.chat/#untitled is an invalid irc:// URL
[20:20:02] <leah> oh
[20:20:04] <leah> i see
[20:20:11] <leah> lol sorry
[20:20:13] <Noisytoot> please change it to something like irc://irc.libera.chat/#untitled
[20:20:21] <leah> i thought it was asking for webchat
[20:20:37] <Noisytoot> In most other entries it's an irc:// URI, not a webchat
[20:20:41] <craigt> vertbyqb: Take a look at the README https://github.com/lbryio/lbry-desktop/blob/master/README.md and see if you can answer your question.
[20:21:53] <craigt> Noisytoot: Hi! Welcome.
[20:22:00] <Noisytoot> Hello
[20:22:56] <Noisytoot> Also I think version download must link to a specific version, as a later version could become nonfree
[20:23:09] <craigt> vertbyqb: I would not consider git necessary for compiling or running, but yarn and node.js seem integral.
[20:23:12] <leah> Noisytoot: fixed
[20:23:37] <Noisytoot> craigt, I think yarn can be replaced with npm (at least in some cases)
[20:23:42] <craigt> vertbyqb: Fortunately, all three are already in the Directory, and I just approved yarn.
[20:23:57] <craigt> Noisytoot: Interesting.
[20:25:52] <craigt> Noisytoot: I'll admit. I'm just taking the README at face value. If the authors say it is a prerequisite, I just roll with it.

[20:34:11] <user9> craigt: Hi and happy friday. Quick question, ABI Dumper and ABI Compliance Checker....they're both developed by the same person from what I can see, they have a homepage at abi-laboratory.pro, the directory has the github repository listed as the homepage for ABI Dumper, and some other seemingly defunct site for ABI Compliance Checker. My question, is it better to have the projects 'personal' homepage in the
[20:34:14] <user9> homepage entry, or the github repository? I notice on the Resource Info tab there are options to add different types of resources, among them is something called VCS repository Webview, it looks like maybe the github page should be added there and the homepage entry should be filled with the actual homepage...does that seem right?
[20:34:19] <user9> Sorry for the novel lol

[21:35:45] <vertbyqb> okay well the offer of source is there as a link to the repo
[21:36:08] <craigt> vertbyqb: Judging by the language of the readme file and headers, it is clearly an oversight. 
[21:36:13] <vertbyqb> so it just needs a copy of the LBRY SDK license

[22:13:01] <leah> craigt: i asked my roommate for inspiration and she said: openttd and openrct
[22:13:14] <leah> apparently openttd is listed https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/OpenTTD
[22:13:17] <leah> openrct doesn't
[22:13:37] <leah> craigt: openrct relies on you extracting textures/maps etc from the original game, which is non-free. but the engine is free software
[22:13:58] <leah> i don't know if openttd does that, or if it also requires you to do that. these are reverse engineered engines afterall
[22:14:14] <leah> anyway, with the above in mind, would openrct be a suitable entry to go on the FSD?

[22:14:40] <leah> it's a program that repairs truncated mp4 files
[22:14:56] <craigt> nonfree assets in games can be tricky.
[22:15:25] <leah> craigt: also, i added Untitled earlier (my static site generator): https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Untitled
[22:16:00] <leah> so many free programs. it's been years since i've parttaken in FSD meetings. i'm trying to think of all the bizarre esoteric projects out there that the FSD doesn't list!
[22:16:14] <Noisytoot> leah, I think you need to add a specific version
[22:16:25] <Noisytoot> Because it may become nonfree in the future
[22:16:26] <leah> partook*
[22:16:39] <Noisytoot> leah, OpenTTD has free assets
[22:16:54] <Noisytoot> OpenRCT doesn't
[22:17:01] <leah> right
[22:17:14] <leah> that explains it then
[22:17:58] <leah> i consider openrct libre. the use of non-free assets is merely a bug that someone with free time and artistic skill can fix later
[22:18:03] <vertbyqb> craigt: so do you notice any other problems with FastLBRY or its entry?
[22:18:29] <Noisytoot> You could say the same about any nonfree software
[22:18:46] <Noisytoot> Until that bug is fixed, it's nonfree
[22:19:02] <leah> u-root isn't listed on the FSD

[22:19:19] <leah> Chttps://github.com/u-root/u-root
[22:19:28] <leah> it's a bootloader written in Go
[22:20:10] <leah> i won't bother adding openrct. i'm guessing fsf won't like that it needs non-free assets

[22:20:40] <craigt> vertbyqb: I am stuck on what exactly is a "written offer" in relation to the GPLv3.
[22:21:30] <leah> craigt: btw there's one other thing that grinds my gears with projects
[22:21:48] <leah> craigt: often times, i will see a COPYING file but not a LICENSE file and declarations are non-existent
[22:21:56] <craigt> vertbyqb: They are providing a link to the source code, but I don't know if that is enough.
[22:22:09] <leah> if a project has no formal declarations in it, but has a COPYING file with just GPLv2 in it, does that mean the whole project is v2-only ?
[22:23:05] <craigt> leah: COPYING and LICENSE are the same to me, but https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-howto.html says to use COPYING.
[22:23:07] *** gordonfish- is now known as gordonfish
[22:23:15] <leah> i will read it, thanks
[22:23:45] <leah> i'm very pedantic about it in my projects. i put formal declarations in every file, and actually nag others about it when they forgot to add their name on a contribution
[22:24:36] <craigt> leah: I think a project with no formal declarations in it, but has a COPYING file with just GPLv2 in its main directory can be treated as a GPLv2 project, but I would recommend sorting it out before using it with plans to redistribute.

[22:28:26] <leah> https://github.com/anthwlock/untrunc is amazing btw
[22:29:23] <leah> i had 12 hours of video footage once but i was using OBS connected to my camera, acting as a webcam. my computer crashed, and i was recording direct to mp4
[22:29:52] <leah> well, the way mp4 works, it has info at the end of the file, about the file, lots of information and metadata
[22:30:09] <leah> however, because obs crashed, that data was missing. and therefore the mp4 file was "truncated"
[22:30:37] <leah> what untrunc does is it takes another mp4 file along with yours, where that mp4 file has similar metadata. and it inteligently repairs your broken file. and using it, i got my recording back
[22:31:04] <craigt> Thanks everybody for another great meeting!
[22:31:17] <craigt> leah: I will queue up your entries for review
[22:31:20] <user9> thanks!

[22:35:59] <vitali64> This is why I stopped using winblows
[22:36:50] <leah> the design of windows is actually nice. ReactOS is a good free OS based on it
[22:37:11] <leah> actually it was just OBS that crashed. my computer was fine
[22:37:36] <leah> which reminds me. ffmpeg-broadcaster and av-caster are much better, lightweight solutions compared to obs. i wonder if fsd documents those
[22:38:19] <leah> not listed :)
[22:38:37] <leah> i know all kinds of projects
[22:39:33] <leah> vitali64: btw obs is available for gnu+linux. trisquel has it in repos
[22:40:09] <vertbyqb> in my opinion windows' design sucks. i guess it's because i'm so used to unix-like OSs like GNU.

[22:50:38] <ggoes> i used to use a typewriter to avoid nonfree software lol
[22:50:41] <ggoes> but that was like 8 years ago

[22:55:34] <ggoes> i don't still have it. i might be able to find a picture. it was a light blue manual that had its own shell case

[22:58:15] <ggoes> oh nice
[22:58:40] <ggoes> i think i paid $65 at a typewriter repair shop in st louis for it
[22:59:23] <bandali> niice
[23:00:24] <bandali> i picked up mine online (currently live in the suburbs where there's nothing as niche as a typewriter) but yea would love to stroll through thriftshops and/or typewriter repairs

[23:06:06] <leah> you linked this
[23:06:20] <leah> 21145 times. that windows computer crashed that many times in one day
[23:06:33] <leah> there are 86400 seconds in one day

[23:07:11] <leah> 86400-21145=65255
[23:07:20] <leah> but for each crash, it must therefore reboot, so as to crash again
[23:07:47] <leah> 65255/21145=3.09 seconds
[23:07:58] <leah> so, every time it crashes, it takes about 3 seconds to reboot

[23:15:06] <leah> Noisytoot: obs is bloat. you can get away with just using ffmpeg for most things
[23:15:42] <leah> a clever trick is even to just straight up do a screencast with a program showing your webcam, and use a tiling window manager. and just stream that
[23:17:06] *** Quits: zleap (~zleap@user/zleap) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:17:08] <leah> obs is mostly aimed at gamers who have high-end hardware anyway. it's quite powerful, but overkill for most other people. ffmpeg is all you need
[23:18:28] <leah> if you see streamers online on youtube or something, and they have comments shown directly in the video feed (live chat comments), it's probably obs that they're using
[23:18:58] <leah> bloat annoys me
[23:19:30] <leah> it's actually offensive, even arrogant, to assume that everyone will have newer computers
