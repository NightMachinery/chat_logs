[00:48:24] <topcat001> I think since it is built into the browser itself it tends to be. I think the dev also uses it himself so problems get fixed quickly.

[01:56:31] <chipps> Hi, I'm trying to setup openVPN on a arch vps that I own for playing around, and I am following this archwiki page: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Easy-RSA. I see here that it mentions that "For security purposes, it is recommended that the CA machine be separate from the machine running OpenVPN.
[01:56:31] <chipps> ". I don't have another vps to do this on. What could go wrong if I do it on the same machine? I don't really have any idea about security, but I am willing to learn.

[01:58:03] <JTL> ksp: PING TIMEOUT
[01:58:10] <kevr> chipps: i would say that is a general recommendation for services which contain secret information. Locating it on another machines removes the possibility of a vpn misconfiguration or exploit to occur, allowing vpn users access to your secret private keys
[01:58:21] <ksp>  Typing out the metadat is a pain tho
[01:58:24] <NetSysFir> https://github.com/dylanaraps/birch
[01:58:30] <kevr> I'm not sure if there's a blaring exploit out there about it, but, it's just safer in general.
[01:58:45] <ksp> But its suprisingly usable
[01:59:19] <JTL> :)
[01:59:24] <chipps> kevr: thanks! I guess I'll try to set up a separate server later.
[01:59:46] <kevr> chipps: as is always required with true security, you must consider your environment, the importance of those keys, and make a decision based on what's less-lossful for you.
[01:59:50] <ksp> jtl: looks like ::) on my end lol

[03:26:07] <kevr> jcbjoe2021: the general approach for help is A) First, search either the wiki about a program or topic, read the entire wiki page, most programs also come with manpages that have spec about how they work.

I have more_itertools installed and now python says that there is no module named more_itertools.  This seems to happen with other packages as well, what could be wrong?

[05:52:08] <Xinayder> okay, I am updating a package I own, and it produces a file with a specific name that changes according to the software version, but this package is supposed to compile from the latest sources in the master branch. I wanted to know if the "correct" way to do this would be to read the version from a file (which the software provides) during the
[05:52:08] <Xinayder> package() step, then pass it to the install command

[05:54:22] <Namarrgon> dD__: do you have any of the testing repos enabled?
[05:54:37] <kevr> it's meant to change when there are new commits, but that's purely based on the shown pkgver() examples.
[05:54:48] <Xinayder> I need to access the file produced by the build commands, which is the one I mentioned above. the "1.18.1-R0.1-SNAPSHOT" part is contained withing a gradle.properties file, for example, and I thought to read this file and just pass it along the install command so I can always get the latest produced file and rename it 
[05:54:49] <kevr> you can generate a version in any way, it's typically done with git describe based on the most recent tag.

[05:55:58] <Xinayder> in other words, the build command for the software produces a versioned jar, how do I access this versioned jar with the install command if it changes every time since the pkgbuild is fetching from master?
[05:56:14] <kevr> the pkgver() function is producing the version.
[05:56:29] <kevr> so you can just use that function to get the version and add the version to whatever you need to in package().
[05:57:23] <dD__> Namarrgon: yes, I have core, testing, and extra
[05:57:40] <Namarrgon> dD__: not community-testing?
[05:57:56] <Namarrgon> dD__: arch doesn't support partial upgrades, you either enable all testing repos or none

[05:59:43] <kevr> the pkgbuild is just shell script from which several things are used.

[06:00:12] <kevr> though, try to stay with guidelines out there

[06:00:49] <dD__> Namarrgon: no, not community testing, I didn't know both should be enabled.  I'll enable it now.   I did not rebuild python3 packages, in fact, was unaware of the 3.10 bump.  Sorry for my ignorance, how would I go about to rebuild them?

[06:12:34] <pisceswolf96> Is there any way to write environment variables (such $PATH or NNN_BMS) as multiline?

[06:13:47] <ectospasm> variable contents in general can be multiline, but I'm not aware of any shell being able to interpret ${PATH} as multiline.  Maybe zsh can, I'd be surprised if bash could.
[06:13:54] <dD__> thanks, Namarrgon, just subscribed and that did it.

[09:09:16] <amcrae> that might pull in an updated library for the package you are installing, which will break packages on your system currently depending on the library

[10:18:31] <bud> f.i. depends=(i3!i3-gaps)
[10:19:00] <LordRishav> Isn't there already such an option?
[10:19:17] <LordRishav> Let me check
[10:19:20] <bud> well there is "conflicts",
[10:19:28] <amcrae> If i3-gaps provides i3, then it should be compatible.  so this is a bug in the i3-gaps package if it does not
[10:20:09] <bud> amcrae, i mean, i am packaging a program. that only works with i3, but not i3-gaps.
[10:20:29] <amcrae> then depend on i3

[10:33:26] <bud> jayache80: i don't think so, you can only scope against versions.
[10:34:30] <bud> and this gets really tricky when packages can "provide" . meaning that i3-gaps provides "i3" and all other packages that depends on i3 and stuff will accept i3-gaps because of provide.
[10:34:48] <bud> when i set i3-gaps as a "conflicts" to my package.
[10:35:16] <jayache80> bud: Gotcha. If that existed (and I don't know what dependency hell that feature itself would create...) then i3-gaps could remove the "provides i3" (as I think it should, because... it doesn't lol, it's experiemental and basically broken in several ways)
[10:35:21] <bud> when the user try to install my package, pacman will see the conflict, and ask the user if they want to remove i3-gaps before installing.
[10:36:08] <bud> even if they both "can" be installed, without any filesystem conflicts, and my pkg does not provide or replace the functionality of i3-gaps/i3 in any way.
[10:37:40] <bud> jayache80: yeah, in a way the issue here is really that i3-gaps is in the "official" repos. if these conflicts where limited to AUR i wouldn't bother with this.
[10:38:38] <bud> out of curiosity are there any other programs besides i3, that could have this kind of conflict? i can't think of any.
[10:39:15] <rcf> bud: acpilight and xbacklight is one I can think of that I actually use

[10:42:06] <bud> if yet another fork of i3-gaps also provides i3, but is named "i3-gape" it would not be caught by the rule. 
[10:42:15] <rcf> Conflicts would be the appropriate resolution really.

[12:30:15] <beastDivision> for the pacman guru's here, I looked inside the pacman db, like core.db and saw the desc files for each package. then i went browsing the mirrors, my question is, if you haven't updated the database in a long time, and your core.db says for example, bash_5_0, but the mirrors only have bash_5_2, pacman is still able to sync the old version package, so where the hell is it getting it from? because

[12:39:38] <beastDivision> so for this whole rolling update thing, the only thing I guess I don't get is, how do new package builds get triggered by the maintainers? especially for things that share dynamicaly loaded libraries, like if glibc gets updated, do the maintainers rebuild every single thing that depends on glibc then publish each derived package to the mirror? and do they do any kind of interpoability testing?
[12:39:40] <beastDivision> does the gist of what im getting at make sense?
[12:39:46] *** Joins: sgoodall (~sgoodall@net-37-117-188-8.cust.vodafonedsl.it)
[12:40:36] <rcf> beastDivision: this will happen, yes. This is why python upgrades are often a source of pain for maintainers -- massive rebuilds are triggered 
[12:41:38] <rcf> beastDivision: if it can't be handled automatially for whatever reason, the official news feed will be upgraded informing you of what steps to take when upgrading. 
[12:42:16] *** Joins: joey7 (~joey@gateway/tor-sasl/joey7)
[12:43:13] <rcf> beastDivision: the main takeaway, though, is that if you do -S when installing new packages, it will work. If you encounter a 404, you will need to upgrade, and you should check the news feed on the main archlinux.org website to see if anything out of the ordinary needs to be done to ensure a smooth upgrade process. 
[12:44:24] <amcrae> glibc does not trigger rebuilds as it is always backwards compatible
[12:44:42] <rcf> amcrae: well, usually. Sometimes they like to have fun (see memcpy) 
[12:45:02] <beastDivision> cool tracking there. okay so I guess the only thing I'm missing is how pacman -Sy breaks stuff, correct me if I'm wrong, but when you do pacman -Sy, it only corrects the core.db / extra.db files right? so is the danger that if you update the database, but don't force an install with the u flag, you could inject a library or dependency that breaks somethign else

[17:02:01] <notrot> arch will only break if you don't "update" for a long time...and even then, will be recoverable fairly easily
[17:02:29] <ayekat> but as a general rule, no matter which distro you pick, you have to expect it to break/misbehave in some way (everything else is unrealistic) - the question is then how well you can pull it out of the swamp again - and there I like that arch is relatively simple in comparison with other distros
[17:02:44] <another|> err.. it can break with unstable updates
[17:02:52] <another|> but then you just rollback
[17:03:02] <mpan> Yeah, what ayekat said. Do not fear the breakage. Learn how to efficiently deal with it.
[17:03:22] <notrot> "rolling release" is for sure the reason why arch break....if/when it does
[17:03:29] <pingpongball> ah
[17:03:35] <ayekat> it's the reason why I also use it on my private servers - I've made the experience that even "server distros" break, but I prefer fixing a broken arch than fixing a broken debian/centos
[17:03:50] <Foucault> archlinux breakage is very exaggerated
[17:03:53] <pingpongball> i was looking archlinux adopt debian release philosophy
[17:04:08] <Foucault> i've had more breakage updating debian between releases
[17:04:11] <notrot> "break" as in, unbootable, for me....
[17:04:16] <another|> ayekat: hmm.. I don't want arch on my servers
[17:04:22] <Foucault> although it's _much_ smoother nowadays
[17:04:28] <notrot> ...if/when it boots up, it's recoverable, relatively very easily
[17:04:29] <ayekat> another|: I do :-P
[17:04:46] <mpan> Yeah, I had more issues with Ubuntu on updates than with Arch. And not even version bumps!
[17:05:05] <mpan> (I manage Ubuntu on my mother’s laptop)
[17:05:08] <another|> ayekat: Do what you must
[17:05:15] <ayekat> no, I do what I want
[17:05:27] <Foucault> although to be fair bugs do creep up some times
[17:05:48] <Foucault> I remember a kernel update once
[17:05:48] <notrot> imo, a server is more prone to breakage (aka, non-booting) cause it generally never reboot....and when it does, there is a new kernel, which might be unbootable

[18:51:19] <j0hn> i meant with which distro are u comfortable?
[18:51:23] <notrot> if you gotta deal with hundreds, maybe headaches from archlinux-rolling-release are not the best
[18:51:30] <alad> debian :o

[18:51:49] <plainoldcheese> yeah if you just want something to hack around on arch is fine but if you will be having clients that depend on uptime maybe use something with more support/resources and sta(b)le packages like debian

[23:36:09] *** Quits: lquidfire (~lquidfire@41.117.154.43) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:36:20] <kevr> or, you can just pip install the deps in your virtualenv, which is what i usually do
[23:36:59] <kevr> i'm pretty sure this is the case, because the dep issue you're running into is already part of depends, so you must have built and installed it

[23:38:09] <kevr> anyway, in the future, please be more exact

[23:38:22] <kevr> when you say "gns3" and there are like 10 gns3 packages, it becomes non-exact
[23:38:51] <Lord_Devi> Ok.  I'm really confused now. This is a BRAND NEW ArchLinux install.  Nothing done to it at all yet.  And I can't login with users.  Password refsued when I login with users in tty still.

[23:38:56] <starfoxtthc> Does anyone know how to search for a specific author in the cached package list on a system
[23:39:06] <starfoxtthc> -s doesnt really work
[23:39:23] <nothereisnotanam> I use kitty as a terminal, and I am trying to get image preview in ranger, but when I installed python-pillow, i still  get an error ranger requires PIL(pillow) for kitty immage preveiw
[23:39:32] <Namarrgon> starfoxtthc: that functionality doesn'T exist. what are you trying to do?
[23:39:56] <starfoxtthc> i can see  this duting an update

[23:41:16] <starfoxtthc> everything i have tried hasnt worked
[23:41:31] <starfoxtthc> i can list authors on individual packages
[23:41:38] <starfoxtthc> but not on all of them
[23:41:59] <starfoxtthc> if there isn't a way i wouldnt mind implementing it
