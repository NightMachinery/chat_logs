[20:01:31] <artao> or who did them
[20:02:10] <artao> both performers and -- as i've learned the importance of over the last decade or so -- the producers
[20:02:28] <artao> performers may play the music, but producers create the song
[20:04:32] <Panther> Around 8:30, the steam pressure became so great that it blew the hatches off.
[20:04:50] <artao> rephrase: Performers may create the music, but producers create the song.
[20:04:55] <Panther> I hate it when that happens.
[20:05:02] <artao> only slightly different, but definitely better
[20:05:26] <artao> ... uh .... hatches off what Panther
[20:05:29] <artao> O.O
[20:05:49] <artao> at 7 p m the main hatchway caved in?
[20:05:52] <Panther> On April 16, 1947, around 8 a.m., smoke was spotted in the cargo hold of the Grandcamp while she was still moored. Longshoremen used a gallon jug of water and two fire extinguishers, but they had no effect and the cargo hold filled with smoke. The longshoremen were ordered to leave. At this point, the captain of the Grandcamp ordered that no water be used, lest the cargo be ruined. Instead, 
[20:05:52] <Panther> he ordered all hatches sealed, and the hold to be filled with steam in an attempt to smother the fire.
[20:06:13] <artao> what is the GRandcam?
[20:06:14] <Panther> This was unlikely to be effective, as ammonium nitrate is an oxidizer, thus neutralizing the extinguishing properties of steam. The steam may have contributed to the fire by converting the ammonium nitrate to nitrous oxide, while augmenting the already intense heat in the ship's hold.

[20:08:00] <artao> ah. i see
[20:08:07] <artao> dayum

[20:18:40] <artao> what patch cables to get?
[20:19:08] <artao> a set of eight 3 foot patch cables, or a set of five various sized stackable patch cables
[20:19:14] <artao> about 30 bucks either way
[20:19:17] <artao> OR! get both
[20:19:40] <artao> stackable patch cables are basically a 1 -> 2 passive mult
[20:19:52] <artao> and i definitely need more mults
[20:20:14] <artao> but also definitely need longer patch cables than i have
[20:21:11] <artao> if i don't spend the money on cables, i'll just spend it on something else
[20:21:18] <artao> like cigs and alcohol

[20:23:18] <artao> cables add up quick eh morf
[20:23:33] <artao> 100 bucks of cables is "boring," but FAR more useful than cigs and alcohol
[20:23:57] <artao> however, i also need sex lube. and can only get a 2-pack of what i want, which is 40 freakn bucks
[20:24:24] <artao> I'm also gonna spring for two right-angle MIDI cables
[20:24:25] <morf> i don't have any audio cables 
[20:24:31] <artao> what?

[22:42:53] <louipc> what about in the woods
