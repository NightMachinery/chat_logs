[00:02:22] <cassepipe> Hi again ! I have been looking at the man of fscanf but I can't get my head around what it does after a successful read when it reaches the end of the file. It seems that if I call fscanf in a loop, when I reach the end of the file, the last call returns EOF according to my tests but the man seems to say that it means a error...
[00:02:53] <fizzie> Then your man page's not great.
[00:03:04] <fizzie> Mine's reasonably clear on that point: "The value EOF is returned if the end of input is reached before either the first successful conversion or a matching failure occurs."
[00:03:21] <cassepipe> Oh I was going to quote that
[00:03:34] <cassepipe> Maybe I dont' understand that correctly then
[00:04:26] <cassepipe> It seems to say it will return EOF only if end of input happens __before__ the first conversion attempt
[00:04:45] <fizzie> Well, before the first successful conversion, but yes, that's right.
[00:04:58] <fizzie> I guess the problem here might also be in how you're testing it.
[00:05:35] <cassepipe> So if there is a successful conversion and after that we reach the end of the file, what does it return ?
[00:05:44] <fizzie> The number of successful conversions.
[00:05:48] <sham1> One of the first problems was using fscanf but that's just me
[00:05:59] <sham1> Yeah, it returns the amount of successful conversions as said
[00:07:34] <fizzie> If that's not what you observe, then I think the problem is likely in your test. For example, if you happen to have it in a `while (!feof(file)) { ... }` loop, there's going to be at least one call for which it returns EOF. Because `feof(file)` does not mean "file pointer is at end of file", it means "the end-of-file indicator for file has been set", and that's only set after an attempt to read from the
[00:07:36] <fizzie> file has failed.
[00:07:46] <cassepipe> But then it reaches the end of the file, so no successful conversion ...
[00:08:36] <fizzie> Didn't you just say there *was* a successful conversion?

[00:16:47] <fizzie> (FWIW, " \n" for fscanf is exactly equivalent to " ", so I'd not put the "\n" there since it looks misleadingly as if you were expecting it to match a newline specifically. But there's a different school of thought that says it's good since it indicates the expected format better, so YMMV. In any case having both the space and the newline is a little odd.)

[01:11:35] <danisanti> Some say that string[] is different than a char *string. Is this true?
[01:11:57] <danisanti> in what way?
[01:12:05] <danisanti> I am learning C
[01:13:04] <twkm> if you want storage you ask for an array.  if you just want to point somewhere you ask for a pointer.
[01:13:26] <sham1> char string[] is an array, so for example a string literal. And as said, char *string is a pointer to a char, which often is a pointer to a string
[01:14:15] <twkm> not to startle, but just in case: there is no string type.

[01:15:49] <cassepipe> danisanti: When you do char *string = "string literal"; it is a false friend. What happens is that the memory that contains the literal is read only data.
[01:16:07] <twkm> (and technically you invade the reserved names with the identifier string though it is doubtful anyone would make an implementation that uses that and the standard certainly won't)
[01:16:41] <twkm> might be read-only.  might be read/write.

[01:17:58] <cassepipe> danisanti: a char array[] can be used as a pointer but you if you use sizeof() operator on it will give the size of the array instead of the size of the pointer.

[01:18:12] <twkm> which is up to the implementation, and might even be different each time it is used.
[01:18:51] <cassepipe> danisanti: But you can only use sizeof on a array in the scope where the array is declared. If you pass it around it derelicts into a pointer, the size information is lost, to you need to pass it around as well

[01:19:17] <danisanti> ok. I am doing a program that will iterate cyclicly around "12345" (without the use of an int). Should this "12345" be string[] or char * string ?
[01:19:37] <sham1> Can't do it without an int realistically
[01:19:41] <twkm> from what you've said, either.
[01:20:21] <cassepipe> Also an array will take memory on the stack, so if you return an array from a function you are effectively returning a pointer to now invalid memory.
[01:20:31] <twkm> if you must not use an integer type then likely you want the pointer to char.

[01:35:27] <twkm> by jens gustedt.
[01:35:31] <constxd> was gonna say king's book
[01:35:38] <constxd> is modern c better?
[01:36:35] <pragma-> danisanti: The C11 books, such as Modern C, are recent enough. Reading through such a book will teach you modern enough C. You can then read the draft PDFs (or HTMLs if you can find em) of the C17, C23, etc standards to see what's new and if they're interesting enough to learn about.
[01:36:59] <constxd> oh i guess king is just c99
[01:37:20] <twkm> jens promised c17 by now.  i suppose i should look.
[01:37:26] <constxd> nothing really changes though it's mostly just additions
[01:37:36] <constxd> reading a c99 book won't teach you a bunch of stuff that's wrong now

[04:22:54] <fizzie> I like `snprintf(s, sizeof s, ...)` when it's possible (i.e., s is an array) because it just looks so obviously correct. But others might disagree.
[04:23:07] *** Joins: oxfuxxx (~oxfuxxx@139.28.218.189)
[04:23:39] <Xgc> alesan: You can't use strlen unless you know the source refers to a C string.  sizeof is safe in this specific case.

[04:24:27] <alesan> yeah but as I #define the length, maybe I should just use such identifier?
[04:24:27] <Xgc> alesan: sizeof requires an array, as fizzie noted.

[04:26:51] <fizzie> The thing with using the #define is, you have to look to a different line of code to reassure yourself the same constant was used to declare the array as is being used in the snprintf. (Of course the obvious counterargument is that you need to do the same for sizeof to verify the type is such that sizeof is meaningful there.)
[04:27:01] <Xgc> alesan: Since you can't restrict your question well enough, the only answer is "do the right thing".
[04:27:33] <alesan> fizzie, OK! Thanks.

[10:11:09] <milesrout> is a struct containing only fields of type 'char' or 'char[N]' for various values of N guaranteed to have no padding? struct test { char type; char subtype; char plen[2]; char key[32]; char sig[64]; char content[]; }; sort of thing
[10:12:03] <milesrout> and on a system with signed char, which of the explicit guarantees around 'char *' pointers are by implication required to also be true of 'unsigned char *' pointers or vice versa (signed char * in implementations with unsigned char)
[10:12:46] <dave0> char is required to have no padding
[10:13:37] <milesrout> including char arrays?
[10:13:41] <dave0> arrays don't have padding either
[10:13:47] <dave0> correct
[10:14:27] <milesrout> that's good, that's what I thought would be true of any remotely reasonable implementation, but just wanted to check. thank you for your help dave0 :)

[12:59:18] <dave0> Dean: x-windows uses a union for it's events ... for example a KeyPress vs a ButtonPress .. they have some things in common (which display it is, probably a time stamp) but there are also differences.. keys have scan codes and ascii characters.. buttons has a position where it was pressed
[13:00:10] <dave0> Dean: in your event loop, you call  NextEvent()  which returns a pointer to a union, then you switch on the event type
[13:01:23] <supakeen> I've had plenty of enum + union as well :)
[13:01:32] <dave0> i don't think it's a memory saving thing in x-windows ... i think it would be awkward to include a bunch of structs into some kind of event super-struct .. plus you have trouble adding new events
[13:01:58] <dave0> i haven't used union so much
[13:02:49] <dave0> i think SDL uses something similar in it's event loop, i'd have to look it up

[15:43:46] <Dean> so you would use restrict only for pointers that will refer to one object only? clarity i'm reading up about the restrict type qualifier
[15:44:02] <Dean> it's purely an optimization thing?
[15:45:18] <supakeen> it tells the compiler that the thing it points to will only ever be accessed through this pointer (or an arithmetic operation on that pointer)

[17:28:36] <roxlu> Hey! I was wondering about this for a while ... I'm working with a library which returns unique error codes when something goes wrong, but don't log a human readable message.

[17:33:12] <roxlu> it makes sense to return a code, but why not also log something that describes the issue
[17:33:29] <trenka> where to?
[17:33:42] <clarity> It makes no sense for libraries to log.  The library doesn't know how exactly you want to do your logging.
[17:34:26] <roxlu> clarity: yeah that kinda makes sense; some libs solve this by calling a user defined log function
[17:35:04] <clarity> Yea, that's a fair approach for some use cases.
[17:35:07] <roxlu> clarity: hmm though, if configurable I think it does make sense tbh. the sooner your users know what they are doing wrong the quicker they can solve it

[18:31:31] <nomagno> Assuming you change short to 'unsigned short', and on your system exactly two unsigned chars fit in an unsigned short, it would have the same effect
[18:31:38] <nomagno> But it wouldn't be equivalent
[18:32:23] <clarity> It's not at all guaranteed to have the same effect
[18:32:49] <nomagno> Hm? Is it not? How so?
[18:33:26] <clarity> Representation of type is largely up to implementation
[18:33:39] <fizzie> Two different things that are both "implementation-defined" have no need to be equivalent.
[18:34:25] <fizzie> The conversion from unsigned to signed where the value can't be represented could just result in a 0. Or a clamped value.
