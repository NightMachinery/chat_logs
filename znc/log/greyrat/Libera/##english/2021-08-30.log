[00:06:21] <Samian> blkshp you've seen how I am without my meds. I wish you were around when this guy "mawk" in #linux-offtopic told me I need to get off my adderall. I'm tired of people thinking they know what's best for others when they never lived in the bodies and minds of the others

[00:10:30] <blkshp> I have that with friends trying to come off depression meds, you can't do that. they have to be reduced slowly if it' the intent to come off the,

[00:14:52] <blkshp> Let's not lump every medical professional in the whole world into one camp.
[00:15:47] <huf> at least some of them keep recommending horse dewormer so you know they care :D
[00:16:06] <blkshp> Apparnetly horse tranqualiser's better.
[00:16:29] <huf> oh for sure
[00:16:41] <huf> if you wanna get fucked up, tranquilizers must be nice :D
[00:16:51] <TechTest> blkshp: ok, most of them

[00:17:33] <blkshp> I don't know where you get this from
[00:17:48] <blkshp> or why you think it to be fair.
[00:17:48] <TechTest> from all the doctors I've encountered

[00:18:58] <blkshp> Yes
[00:19:22] <blkshp> Like a normal human being I don't like it when people die.
[00:20:06] <TechTest> sure you don't like it, but do you really care?
[00:20:14] <blkshp> Yes
[00:20:23] <huf> yeah but doctors dont rip their clothes nor pour ash on their heads nor keen soulfully when their patients die
[00:20:32] <huf> this is proof of some stupid-ass idiocy TechTest is pushing 
[00:20:37] <TechTest> so do you treat clients equally to friends and family?
[00:21:01] <huf> in fact, every time a patient dies, all doctors in the country should start singing a lament
[00:21:04] <huf> in sync
[00:21:40] <blkshp> TechTest: no, but not really the point.
[00:21:55] <TechTest> huf: sure you don't need to listen to me, you can trust your health to a doctor 
[00:21:59] <blkshp> People don't become doctors if they didn't care.,
[00:22:12] <blkshp> IT's too much work for too little reward for the first 10 years at least.
[00:22:58] <TechTest> people become doctors for the money blkshp 
[00:23:07] <huf> haha
[00:23:09] <blkshp> I'm not carrying on with this.
[00:23:16] <huf> oh for sure, this is globally true
[00:23:28] <huf> TechTest: can you try not making childish generalizations?
[00:23:32] <huf> or if you cant, just fuck off
[00:24:13] <huf> I mean... doctors?
[00:24:21] <TechTest> huf: go make some research on the laws protecting doctors from medical mistakes in your country and then come back to tell me to fuck off
[00:24:22] <huf> have a go at fucking cops, that's normal
[00:24:23] <huf> and good
[00:24:40] <blkshp> Let's not do that either.
[00:25:48] <TechTest> you can think it's good huf, I never said it is
[00:26:13] <huf> it's not that you cant criticize the medical profession
[00:26:26] <huf> but at least try not to be so stupid about it
[00:26:37] <huf> this is "haha broccoli is bad" level of thinking
[00:26:45] <huf> it's just sad from an adult
[00:28:49] <TechTest> who is being stupid right now is in question 
[00:29:11] <huf> apparently your reading comprehension is pretty bad too

[03:06:44] <tinwhiskers> nice GuiToris. 
[03:07:05] <ash_worksi> okay so suppose a particular juridiction passes a law, like... the only bikes that people can ride must be from one of those electric bike racks

[03:07:22] <GuiToris> I hope they'll survive the winter
[03:07:42] <ash_worksi> and so people scramble to be the vendor for this service, but the laws change from juridiction to jurisdiction
[03:07:44] <tinwhiskers> yeah, they look pretty healthy
[03:08:20] <ash_worksi> what is a good verb to describe the act of a jurisdiction enacting a law that requires your service?
[03:08:59] <GuiToris> tinwhiskers, https://www.dropbox.com/s/rjbbu5vozy7gghz/P8290038.jpg?dl=0 have you experienced anything like this? I lost the middle part of the plant, but it started to grow a new one on the side

[15:25:50] <darsie> This wording upsets me, as it implies the mail server will only accept solicited mails, but there is no channel for the receiver to tell the mail server that this mail is solicited. I'd have to send the mail to the receiver for the receiver being able to tell the server it is solicited. That's stupid.
[15:27:07] <darsie> Or I could send the receiver a hash of the mail so the receiver could tell the server it is solicited. But that's stupid, either, because then the receiver wouldn't know the content of the mail and had no reason to solicit the mail.
[15:27:21] <darsie> .w solicit
[15:27:23] <tinsoldier> solicit — Noun: 1. (archaic) solicitation, — Verb: 1. To persistently endeavor to obtain an object, or bring about an event., 2. To woo; to court., 3. To persuade or incite one to commit some act, especially illegal or sexual behavior., 4. To offer to perform sexual activity, especially when for a payment. https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/solicit
[15:28:47] <darsie> Hmm, I thought solicit means to request something.

[15:29:05] <pussipupu> I think including nurse sharks

[15:29:46] <darsie> ok
[15:31:06] <twb> darsie: in the prostitution sense, it means saying "will you give me $1 for a blow job?"
[15:31:37] <twb> You're allowed to say "will you give me $1?" and "would you like a blow job?" but not both at once >_<
[15:31:48] <darsie> ok, but I didn't not propose a blow job in teh mail.

[15:32:13] <darsie> hmm, nm
[15:32:35] <twb> in the email sense, it comes from the term "unsolicited commercial email" to mean spam
[15:32:57] <darsie> Yeah, but any non requested email is unsolicited.
[15:33:21] <darsie> The rare exception is when someone requests a password reset email or so.
[15:33:31] <twb> By design it does not tell you how to "become" solicited.
[15:33:34] <darsie> Or a reply to an email.
[15:33:47] <twb> A typical workaround is to call the human, and have them add your email address to their address book.
[15:34:00] <darsie> But it's my outgoing mail server that says it's unsolicited.

[15:34:16] <twb> darsie: then you have misconfigured your MSA
[15:34:24] <darsie> Well, the outgoing mail server of my ISP.
[15:34:50] <twb> darsie: right.  You should be using submission/tcp (not smtp/tcp), and you should be doing basic-over-starttls authenticatoin
[15:35:11] <twb> darsie: your ISP will issue you either an authentication token, or (more likely) a username and password.
[15:35:22] <darsie> hmm
[15:35:41] <twb> darsie: if you don't do these steps, you are being an "MTA" not an "MSA", and the ISP's MTA interprets your behaviour as an attack from a compromised host

[15:36:02] <twb> This advice is general, and is true like 95% of the time.  Your ISP might be an exception.
[15:37:08] <twb> You might prefer to use a third-party provider like fastmail or gmail; their MSA config is basically identical to what I have described above
[15:37:30] <twb> Useful test programs for smtp submission include msmtp and curl

[23:21:45] <OnkelTem> Hi folks
[23:22:04] <OnkelTem> I cannot find a program which would allow me to read two books on one screen 
[23:22:47] <OnkelTem> For example, french text to the left and english to the right 
[23:22:53] *** Quits: kerfluffy (~kerfluffy@user/kerfluffy) (Quit: My iMac has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[23:23:00] <OnkelTem> these two texts should be connected to each other 
[23:23:23] <OnkelTem> I mean, when scrolling.
[23:23:51] <OnkelTem> I couldn't find anything like this for Android, and now - on my Linux
[23:24:14] <huf> vim
[23:24:15] <TechTest> interesting
[23:24:26] <TechTest> I guess you can split your monitors in two segments
[23:25:19] <huf> :se scrollbind
[23:26:47] <huf> at least... it should work
[23:26:57] <huf> ah yeah it does
[23:27:09] <Inhahe> i would think the two texts would have to be made to work with each other with metadata connecting the corresponding parts and the software would have to be made to work with that. because one langauge could be more wordy than the other so they wouldn't necessarily scroll equally fast.
[23:27:33] <huf> oh sure, the idea doesnt work at all unless it's actually a two-language text
[23:27:46] <huf> but you can at least take a look and see how badly it doesnt work :D
[23:28:02] <pussipupu> You'll need to get a parallel translation of the text
[23:28:24] <pussipupu> Or a bilingual secretary to do the syncing
[23:28:31] <TechTest> that's hard to get
[23:28:37] <TechTest> well, depending on the language
[23:29:10] *** Quits: MetaNova (~zero-one@znc/supporter/metanova) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[23:34:19] <OnkelTem> Looks like you folks haven't invested enough thinking into this idea of bind scrolling :) 
[23:34:56] <OnkelTem> It wiil work, how having more words in one language may break it?
[23:35:06] *** Joins: MetaNova (~zero-one@znc/supporter/metanova)
[23:35:22] <huf> because you've scrolled down one chapter on one side but only half a chapter on the other
[23:35:31] <huf> and now you're reading chapter two on the left but still chapter one on the right
[23:35:36] <OnkelTem> So you have for example 10 pages in one doc and 20 in another. 1% scrolling of the former would scroll the same 1% in the other. 
[23:35:40] <huf> looks like you havent invested enough thinking into this idea
[23:36:13] <huf> ah yes, because it's well known that languages are longer/shorter by a constant multiplier
[23:36:16] <huf> always
[23:36:22] <OnkelTem> sure
[23:36:49] <huf> the way this works is that actual humans do work to sync the two texts
[23:36:53] <huf> that's how these books are made
[23:37:25] <pussipupu> You could lock it paragraph by paragraph and blindly hope that that lines up reliably
[23:37:36] <pussipupu> (which is a less terrible idea than words or sentences)
[23:37:49] <OnkelTem> this should work even with different formatting. The only thing that can really spoil this 1 to 1 matching is possible presence of prefaces, introductions from the editors and translators. But this can be tweaked only once: you just trim the longer book (or both) from the beginning/end/both 
[23:38:37] <huf> pussipupu: you need a format that has actual paragraphs
[23:38:39] <huf> not just the image of them
[23:38:41] <huf> but yeah
[23:39:04] <OnkelTem> pussipupu: it's assumed that you more or less can read the foreign language and this differnce won't be a big problem for you. In other words you can always find the spot in the other document. 
[23:39:18] <pussipupu> True, make sure you buy your books with good markup
[23:39:33] <pussipupu> Just scroll them both then
[23:40:02] <pussipupu> Read them in emacs in a split frame or something
[23:40:09] <OnkelTem> I would say: just tweak scrolling time to time, if they got unsynced too much 
[23:40:48] <huf> yeah, much easier to just have splits and bind keys to scrolling each split
[23:41:18] <pussipupu> Yeah, down and up for both, left and right
[23:45:54] <OnkelTem> I wish such an app would exist for Android. And making my own seems like too much work. Implement a dozen of ebook formats, meh
[23:46:23] <OnkelTem> Or at least: txt, mobi, epub, fb2
[23:46:51] <huf> you wouldnt have to write the whole thing
[23:47:02] <huf> open source ebook reading apps already exist
[23:48:06] <OnkelTem> I hope so. Well, I'm not familiar well with Android... cuisine: what they have, how they share libs etc

[23:48:24] <huf> well, it's complete and utter shit
[23:48:36] <OnkelTem> lol, quite expected
[23:48:38] <huf> I wouldnt bother with android, it's just a fucking hellhole
[23:49:46] <OnkelTem> I don't want to learn Java in the first place. In my dreams I write my first Android app on JavaScript/React for example :)
[23:49:55] <huf> *cry*
[23:52:01] * OnkelTem slaps huf
[23:52:23] <pussipupu> Oh are we onto how terrible Android is?
[23:52:31] <huf> just a little excursion
[23:52:36] <OnkelTem> haha
[23:52:37] <pussipupu> Welcome to my TEDx talk
[23:52:52] <OnkelTem> Out of interest, really, huf, what do you have in mind? 
[23:53:37] <huf> fucking
[23:53:40] <OnkelTem> Of course I'm not a fan of that my idea, it's just that... I know JS now. I don't know what people use nowadays ofr mobile programming
[23:53:40] <huf> but how is that relevant here?
[23:54:22] <huf> OnkelTem: js and react are web technologies and the web is also terrible
[23:54:23] <OnkelTem> Sure, it's not relevant, I agree
[23:54:24] <OnkelTem> but since we've already started this...
[23:54:38] <TimMc> example.com is okay
[23:57:58] <pussipupu> The web is ok except that HTML, JavaScript and how CSS is used are terrible and web development is almost universally a genuine abomination
[23:58:15] <pussipupu> there's some pretty good cat videos
[23:58:15] <huf> yes, and that has resulted in terrible technologies
[23:58:29] <huf> the browser being the chief villain here
[23:59:32] <pussipupu> To be fair SGML can be fairly transparently treated as s-exprs
[23:59:44] <huf> really fucked up ones
[23:59:51] <huf> because they have children AND attributes
