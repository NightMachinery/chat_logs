[00:05:09] <blscoe> If my terminal PuTTY and editor Emacs suports 24 bit colors, there would be no brightcyan?
[00:05:23] *** Joins: ec_ (~ec@gateway/tor-sasl/ec)
[00:05:57] <blscoe> And Gotham-theme is not design to take option 1 in the terminal, so it tries to find bright cyan.
[00:06:02] <wasamasa> there's a pending patch for 24 bit color terminals
[00:06:35] <blscoe> Is that as of today? : )
[00:06:39] *** Joins: yunusemrecan (~user@176.236.76.81)
[00:06:49] <wasamasa> no, I had a request some months ago and asked them to test
[00:06:52] <wasamasa> and they never replied
[00:07:01] <blscoe> Ah
[00:07:09] <blscoe> But that is the cause of this bug, right?
[00:07:32] <wasamasa> no, that's an unrelated thing
[00:07:57] <wasamasa> don't get your hopes up about 24bit colors in terminals because emacs implements it in a really weird way

[09:20:28] <afidegnum> yes 
[09:21:05] <afidegnum> the issue is, when i tried a simple execution, it works, i.e putting the echo to sleep for x time, I was able to continue working on the buffer,

[13:57:36] <wasamasa> I begrudgingly ended up undusting an old facebook account I specifically made for tinder many years ago
[13:57:39] <wasamasa> and using facebook chat
[13:57:48] <lampilelo> lol, look at us noobs that don't have instagram accounts trying to make sense of that
[13:58:08] <rnkn> apparently I was supposed to instagram add her and then I guess continue flirting there?
[13:58:12] <wasamasa> oh right, I made an instagram account for reasons (think I tried using their API)
[13:58:24] *** Joins: crazazy (~user@130.89.171.62)
[13:58:37] <rnkn> but I was like (to ex), instagram can't call people like a ph number
[13:58:45] <rnkn> she checks... instagram can now call people
[13:58:50] <wasamasa> lol
[13:58:55] <lampilelo> wat
[13:59:03] <rnkn> and then I gave up on the world
[13:59:11] <wasamasa> due to popular demand clearly
[13:59:43] <wasamasa> I can understand why someone would use <insert service they already have>
[13:59:57] <wasamasa> but trying to retroactively make up a good reason for it, like seeing your social status
[14:00:07] <lampilelo> i guess it all goes towards centralization of messaging, you will have one messaging backend for all services
[14:00:09] <rnkn> "I have this great new app it's called phone"
[14:00:22] <lampilelo> because people just can't be bothered by opening 2 apps at the same time
[14:00:35] <Guest-liao> Like github,json API
[14:01:09] <rnkn> I just can't believe all these years when I was shrugging off people's instagram @'s I was supposed to say "sorry I don't have insta but give me your phone number"
[14:01:39] <lampilelo> hahah
[14:01:56] <crazazy> oh in latest instagram news I heard they had snail meme
[14:01:59] <crazazy> memes*
[14:02:02] <wasamasa> and all the time I thought people publicly mentioning their instagram accounts on dating platforms are just vain self-advertisers
[14:02:16] <crazazy> and I should join instagram and just follow that snail account
[14:02:43] <crazazy> wasamasa: I've seen people advertise their linktr.ee
[14:02:47] <wasamasa> clearly I need to talk more with my fellow normies
[14:03:02] <wasamasa> sorry, emacs
[14:03:14] <crazazy> so in that regard I think an insta plug isn't too far gone
[14:03:16] <wasamasa> it's not you, it's the outside world compelling me to spend less time on you
[14:03:16] <Guest-liao> They make money from instagram

[14:04:02] <crazazy> or like some girl was advertising something like playWithMe or something

[14:05:33] <crazazy> curious
[14:05:52] <crazazy> and these guys that offer services are usually compensating
[14:06:02] <wasamasa> there's like a handful of really important gamers

[14:06:28] <wasamasa> they're very visible and many people flock towards them

[14:16:51] <wasamasa> crazazy: I've scoped it out and it seems unfeasible
[14:18:05] <artefact> sounds simpler to make a "lonely hearts" mailing list that rejects user-agent headers that are not gnus, mu4e, notmuch, rmail etc :-)
[14:18:38] <wasamasa> you could do that, but that severely restricts the dating pool
[14:18:44] <rnkn> which would likely have just as much success at connections as just a mailing list
[14:18:55] <artefact> bonus point, make a captcha to register that involves debugging emacs lisp

[14:19:01] <rnkn> "we met on a mailing list" - no couple ever
[14:19:10] <wasamasa> there are people who met over IRC

[14:20:52] <artefact> i haven't because i'me kind of a recluse. unless you count key signing events
[14:21:11] <wasamasa> lol
[14:21:18] <wasamasa> I considered the idea of a key signing party, but nope
[14:21:25] <wasamasa> it seems so fucking pointless these days
[14:21:43] <rnkn> does everyone put their keys in a bowl?
[14:21:56] <rnkn> or is that a different kind of party
[14:22:20] <artefact> it's not pointless but it's become only marginally useful, since most keyservers are vulnerable to poisoned keys
[14:22:34] <wasamasa> I guess the party aspect is about everyone's key getting signed
[14:24:46] <Guest-liao> Are you guys talking about the actual party? 
[14:24:49] <lampilelo> what if everybody is drunk and someone throws a forged key into the bowl?
[14:24:58] <artefact> i put my fingerprint on my personal homepage, txt record in my domain name, github/gitlab profiles, and opengpg keyserver (which requires e-mail verification). it's probably good enough for light authentication
[14:25:17] <rnkn> I gave up on GPG six months ago and I've been meaning to write a blog post about it
[14:25:34] <rnkn> it feels like one of those grass-is-greener moments
[14:25:38] <rnkn> like deleting facebook
[14:25:59] <artefact> gpg still has use cases other than the web of trust aspect
[14:26:25] <artefact> it's an easy-ish interface to asymmetric/symmetric crypto. and it's still used a lot on dark nets
[14:27:33] <lampilelo> it's too complicated for most people
[14:27:39] <wasamasa> yeah
[14:27:44] <rnkn> openssl pkeyutl -encrypt -inkey "$public_key" -pubin
[14:27:44] <artefact> most pepole are stupid and don't need gpg in the first place. it's a moot argument i think
[14:27:45] <wasamasa> GPG for email though, nope
[14:27:51] <wasamasa> just say no
[14:28:21] <artefact> if you have enough brain cells to read a man page, you can use gpg
[14:28:43] <wasamasa> I have to always look up how to extend the duration of my gpg key
[14:28:45] <rnkn> if anyone would like to vet my POSIX password manager, https://git.bydasein.com/pw/tree/pw.sh
[14:28:48] <wasamasa> especially both parts of it

[14:39:48] <wasamasa> I'm not exactly looking forward to openssl3

[14:40:42] <wasamasa> it's arguable how good these defaults are
[14:40:50] <rnkn> yeh ppl say that, but I'm pretty sure I've been winging it and hit no problems

[20:56:49] <akater[m]> deego: Note that evaluating defun form might just produce compiled code anyway (in which case the var would obviously be lexical).  This would happen in some CL implementations, for example.   Also, if there's (an equivalent of) compile-file, such a function could theoretically eval defvars in a file first.  So it's a fairly subtle issue.

[23:12:20] <fsbot> hei !
