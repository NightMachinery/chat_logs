[00:22:59] <jaawerth> 1 out of 3 what?
[00:24:55] <jaawerth> tree-sitter can get pretty complicated if you want to do fancy stuff. but for the core features it was just a matter of using the small boilerplate in the nvim-treesitter readme to get things up and running, then installing a TS-friendly syntax theme so it takes advantage of the better highlighting

[00:42:22] <entuland> yeah thinking about that again, it's good to have the IDs there to differentiate the names as you may have more, ignore that
[00:42:33] <entuland> not sure I get the question though
[00:42:39] <onosendi> Yeah, they need to be unique for the backend.
[00:42:40] <entuland> isn't that code doing what you want?
[00:42:57] <onosendi> entuland: the see the comments in `handleChange`
[00:43:37] <onosendi> Is this something where I don't use refs, and would resort to `querySelector` on the `name` prop?

[06:27:17] <ljharb> rustyshackleford: right, it's not a good idea
[06:27:25] <ashnur> automatic namespacing is a self-defeating concept to me, only reason i ever do similar stuff is when i just want some huge list of modules loaded indiscriminately, but that's importing, not exporting
[06:27:37] <ljharb> rustyshackleford: it's relatively common, and people's usual justification is "treeshaking", but that can never 100% remove the bloat you just added

[06:28:17] <rustyshackleford> I better google treeshaking
[06:29:11] <rustyshackleford> ljharb: I feel like its sort of a common pattern
[06:29:20] <ljharb> rustyshackleford: it's a way for bundlers to *try* and guess which code isn't used, and delete it
[06:29:21] <rustyshackleford> especially in scaffolding type of tools
[06:29:25] <ljharb> rustyshackleford: it is common. but that doesn't mean it's good.

[09:03:09] <ljharb> switchnode: don't use Date at all

[13:43:54] <jacekowski> why does this fail if schema.attributes is undefined?
[13:43:57] <jacekowski> and how to fix it
[13:44:43] <siyb> because !== does a typecheck and undefined is undefined and 'undefined' is a string
[13:46:28] <jacekowski> i don't think so
[13:46:41] <jacekowski> i mean, that is probably a problem as well
[13:46:43] <jacekowski> but
[13:46:44] <jacekowski> TypeError: Cannot read property 'DisplayName' of undefined at InfluxFetch.js:155
[13:47:16] <jacekowski> so it's failing because attributes is undefined
[13:48:17] <jacekowski> i could check if attributes exists before checking for elements within it, but, if i was 20 levels deep i would have to check each object on the way there and i would like to think there is a better solution

[16:12:24] <stenno> not sure what you mean with contextless here
[16:12:24] <cthulchu> no, function(){} still adds context.
[16:12:35] <cthulchu> well one that doesn't create it's own this
[16:12:39] <cthulchu> like arrow functions
[16:13:18] <stenno> back then we used to do `var that = this;` to do something which looks like lexical scoping

[17:10:12] <entuland> I've found _one_ satellite.js and I wasn't able to find any reference to that function, probably a fork or something completely different

[17:12:39] <cthulchu> or if the last param was just a bunch of options. that makes sense too
[17:12:41] <Alexendoo> It's a completely typical  options object...
[17:12:46] <entuland> uhm... those docs point out at those functions being deprecated
[17:12:54] <entuland> they use past tense in the actual page

[17:14:46] <entuland> by the way, your code should be working at a glance
[17:15:03] <entuland> you may need to explain what you mean with "not working as I expect"
[17:17:24] <cthulchu> well if I supply integer and it expects object, the integer is just being ignored

[17:18:18] <cthulchu> I left a request for them to do that
[17:18:39] <entuland> the deprecated function was probably completely different stuff, then they moved to that js-cookie, which had a different syntax
[17:19:24] <entuland> so the code you have pasted in your message above _works_, but you want it to work passing "1" instead of "{expiry: 1}"

[17:20:22] <entuland> honestly, doubt they'd change it
[17:20:48] <entuland> as the whole point of having an object there is to let the user provide expires, path, domain and whatnot
[17:21:11] <cthulchu> in vast majority of cases, we don't need to provide path, domain and other stuff
[17:21:40] <cthulchu> expires is almost as vital as the name and the value of the cookie
[17:21:49] <entuland> yep, but it's not like you are going to litter your codebase with those calls
[17:21:53] <entuland> and you could proxy it
[17:21:59] <cthulchu> not really
[17:22:03] <entuland> why not?
[17:22:08] <cthulchu> I have a bunch of clients who use that library
[17:22:14] <cthulchu> I'm not gonna build proxies for each
[17:22:18] <entuland> oh I see
[17:22:49] <entuland> well, if the original setCookie is going deprecated, you'll have to alter your codebase anyways
[17:22:54] <cthulchu> moreover, I see a lot of devs making the same mistake. I even stopped using their function and started using the document's api for it.
[17:23:01] <entuland> at that point, decouple it and centralize the dependency
[17:23:11] <cthulchu> yes, but the habits stay
[17:23:21] <entuland> aye, but something has to give
[17:23:34] <entuland> just pick the least evil of the compromises
[17:23:40] <cthulchu> if they add a simple type check, then everyone is happy
[17:24:22] <entuland> you could as well just replace that function in the library before any of your clients uses it :P
[17:25:22] <entuland> so that you don't have to change the codebase at all, just inject your variant, if you can

[20:14:40] <wroathe> I think maybe where the confusion came from above is that so much of what I pointed out is boilerplate nonsense, and so it probably feels offensive to compare that to "real OOP", but the truth of the matter "real OOP" is basically boilerplate nonsense

[20:26:35] <Donitz> indeed
[20:26:46] <Donitz> and that nonsense was a bunch of different ways of implementing classes
[20:27:02] *** Quits: onosendi (~onosendi@user/onosendi) (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)
[20:27:26] <systemfault> There was a "standard one"... but it was so painful to use that every framework invented their own custom way to do them
[20:27:54] <systemfault> function Point(x, y){ this.x = x; this.y = y} Point.prototype.blah = ....
[20:28:23] <wroathe> super(), inheritance generally, calling .bind to change event listener context
[20:28:39] <wroathe> pointless encapsulation
[20:28:41] <wroathe> to name a few
[20:29:33] <systemfault> I haven't personally used .bind in years... The rest is typical class-based OOP crap.
[20:29:40] <wroathe> Yup
[20:29:50] <wroathe> aka "boilerplate nonsense"
[20:29:55] <Donitz> I don't mind super
[20:30:01] <Donitz> I find it helpful in controlling the order of events
[20:30:13] <Donitz> for example, when cleaning up objects, I may want to reverse the call order
[20:30:16] <Donitz> so I put super last
[20:30:21] <systemfault> wroathe: I personally agree but that non-sense is pretty much the standard
[20:30:42] <wroathe> systemfault: Sure, but that's what I meant above by there being a PR nightmare in trying to move away from it
[20:31:05] <Donitz> but yeah
[20:31:09] <wroathe> systemfault: OOP is so deeply rooted that a significant portion of your user base would throw a fit if you just wholesale moved away from classes
[20:31:13] <Donitz> event listener removal is bloody awful
[20:31:20] <Donitz> having to keep track of the original binded functions
[20:31:24] <Donitz> awful
[20:31:43] <systemfault> Donitz: Make yourself a mini wrapper
[20:31:57] <wroathe> context is just generally awfully
[20:32:11] <Kirjava> n> MutString=t=>{const n=[...t];return new Proxy({},{get:(t,e,i)=>e===Symbol.toPrimitive?()=>n.join(""):"function"==typeof String.prototype[e]?String.prototype[e].bind(n.join("")):1/e?n[e]:"length"===e?n.length:Reflect.get(new String(n.join("")),e,i),set(t,e,i){n.splice(e,1,...String(i)),n.splice(0,n.length,...n.filter(t=>t))}})}; o = MutString('test'); o[2] = 'x'; `${o}`
[20:32:12] <jellobot> (okay) 'text'
[20:32:37] <wroathe> generally awful*
[20:32:40] <Donitz> well, when you want an event to call a class method, you pretty much have to use bind
[20:32:49] <Donitz> I like to have functions such as handleResize in my classes
[20:32:54] <Donitz> bound to window resize
[20:33:18] <Donitz> annoys me that I can't call it onResize

[20:36:16] <wroathe> 11:02 < Donitz> well, when you want an event to call a class method, you pretty much have to use bind
[20:36:19] <wroathe> Donitz: Seeing a pattern here?
[20:36:22] <systemfault> Donitz: You could write a two lines wrapper... a bit like
[20:36:23] <systemfault> const addEventListener = (elem, name, callback) => {elem.addEventListener(name, callback); return () => elem.removeEventListener(name, callback) }
[20:36:25] <Donitz> this.handleResizeBound = this.handleResize.bind(this); addEventListener('resize', this.handleResizeBound);
[20:36:54] <systemfault> Ah ok
[20:37:04] <Donitz> but so ugly
[20:37:40] <wroathe> Or just: addEventListener('resize', handleResize);
[20:37:49] <systemfault> You'd have the same issues without classes... as long as you use "this"
[20:37:52] <Donitz> it's inside the constructor of a class
[20:38:16] <wroathe> systemfault: But you wouldn't use `this`
[20:38:19] <wroathe> systemfault: That's the point
[20:38:29] <systemfault> I don't :p But most people do
