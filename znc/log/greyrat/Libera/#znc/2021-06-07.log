[19:21:30] <greyrat> DarthGandalf: Is it normal for the ZNC-connected user to have noticeable delays? My messages can take from a second to more than 10 seconds to arrive
[19:22:10] <DarthGandalf> It is not
[19:22:30] <DarthGandalf> Probably the server where you put ZNC to has very slow network?
[19:22:42] <lucerne> Thelounge is on the same server
[19:23:16] <DarthGandalf> no idea then
[19:23:18] <DarthGandalf> try znc -D
[19:23:27] <DarthGandalf> and see in logs the time of the messages
[19:30:02] <greyrat> DarthGandalf: I think I got `/znc` working. How can I test if it's working? (`/znc down` doesn't produce any output)
[19:31:01] <DarthGandalf> /znc help
[19:36:58] <anth> “<DarthGandalf> . /znc == /msg *status” — huh. I did not know that! Neat.

[20:34:52] <Netboy3> if you don't want to enable "unknown commands" you can also create an alias for znc "/quote znc" that will allow using "/znc" in most clients
[20:39:15] <DarthGandalf> most clients already support it :)
[20:39:33] <DarthGandalf> only some clients by default refuse to send unknown commands to server
[20:41:05] <Netboy3> true, but the discussion was regarding clients that error with "unknown command"

[21:49:43] <bahamat> Hi all. I can't get znc to work with nickserv here on libera.chat. When I log in it says "invalid password for password2" then "invalid password for bahamat"
[21:49:50] <bahamat> How do I fix this?
[21:49:53] *** Joins: awth13 (~user@193.27.14.133)
[21:50:40] <bahamat> My password is *not* password2. And that string is not anywhere in my config. So I have no idea where that's coming from.
[21:52:17] <DarthGandalf> use [[sasl]]
[21:52:17] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/sasl
[21:52:28] <bahamat> thanks

[22:07:06] <bahamat> This still isn't working.
[22:08:02] <bahamat> I added LoadModule = sasl to znc.conf config under my user under the libera network
[22:08:28] <KindOne> Are you editing the znc.conf?
[22:08:34] <bahamat> KindOne: Yes
[22:08:46] <KindOne> You are not supposed to do that. /msg *status loadmod sasl
[22:08:59] <bahamat> I did, but when I restarted the service the module wasn't loaded.
[22:10:32] <bahamat> So I edited znc.conf to make sure it's loaded. Now when I restart the process it says it's load, which is fine.
[22:10:53] <bahamat> But I still get errors from nickserv
[22:10:54] <KindOne> /msg *sasl set bahamat password2

[22:11:49] <bahamat> OK, I guess I was wrong, and sasl still isn't loaded.
[22:12:10] <bahamat> How do I permanently set it to always load sasl no matter what?
[22:15:49] <KindOne> Once its loaded, its loaded.
[22:16:10] <bahamat> what about when the process restarts?
[22:16:18] <bahamat> Because when I restart the process, it's not loaded.
[22:16:32] <KindOne> How are you restarting znc?
[22:17:41] <bahamat> I'm restarting the service in my operating system
[22:18:15] <bahamat> I think what happens is its sent SIGTERM and its given 120s to stop before being sent SIGKILL.
[22:18:22] <bahamat> Then execute the command like normal
[22:18:41] <KindOne> That is most likely where this issue is happening. You should restart/shutdown znc via *status

[22:22:56] <bahamat> ok
[22:23:36] <bahamat> Yeah, ok. Loading sasl followed by saveconfig was what I needed.
[22:23:52] <bahamat> Looks like everything is working with nickserv now.
[22:23:54] <KindOne> Yeah that would work
[22:24:34] <bahamat> Sorry for being dense...I set up znc like 4 years ago and haven't had to touch it since then, so I actually know very little about it.
[22:25:33] <bahamat> I've done upgrades, but for the most part it just is a rock solid, dependable system that I don't have to think about. So it's really great, and it solves some key issues for me.
[22:26:36] <bahamat> Anyway, thanks for helping me get that sorted out. Now I can finally delete all of my freenode stuff.
