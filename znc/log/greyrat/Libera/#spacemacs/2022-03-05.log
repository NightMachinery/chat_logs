[07:15:13] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> There's an ongoing discussion for #15388. I want to suggest further changes for the `git` layer, for this PR; what's the best way to contribute to that? Simply by commenting or replying to a thread in the open PR? If so, that doesn't let maintainers directly accept commits from me for the same PR; maintainers would be required to manually merge my suggestions themselves, or I would need to open another PR 
[07:15:13] <FromGitter> ... which is dependent on @practicalli-john's PR.
[07:27:42] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> @bryce-carson Join the discussion so everyone knows the scope of your PR. If it's not depended on #15388, you can open a new one and I'll merge it manually.
[07:29:16] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> Alright. I'll join the discussion. Can you advice which I should do, though? ‚èé  ‚èé At the moment, I am writing my suggestions for the layer in the `README.org` after merging John's changes into a branch of my fork.
[07:30:51] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> if you modifications are relatively simple, I will merge yours first ...
[07:31:52] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> it's been a little while that I'm the only active maintainer and I've limited time
[07:33:06] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> Okay, I'll contribute my suggestions in the PR discussion thread, then.
[07:33:43] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> Okay. I'll add you to co-author
[07:41:51] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> What does that mean?
[07:42:35] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> each git commit can have more than 1 author
[07:43:27] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> just write co-authored-by: username <email> and it will make that user an co-author
[07:43:39] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> write it in commit message I mean
[07:51:44] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> I see.
[07:52:58] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> Rather, I understand now that commits may have more than one author. ‚èé  ‚èé Here is where I sit: ‚èé I have changes prepared in a local branch which merged John's changes. I can push these to my fork. ‚èé  ... [https://gitter.im/syl20bnr/spacemacs?at=6222e5a18db2b95f0a513fe2]
[07:53:07] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> Or just copy-paste my changes and tell you what line to add them in.
[08:01:18] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> use git format-patch to general a patch file
[08:01:58] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> git checkout to a branch that's updated as upstream develop branch
[08:02:11] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> git apply the patch
[08:02:22] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> save all the changes to your fork
[08:02:28] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> submit a new PR
[08:03:14] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> Okay, thank you very much. That helps. This is the gnarliest Git stuff I've done as of yet.
[08:03:40] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> s/general/generate
[08:08:19] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> alternatively use git rebase -i and drop his commit and only keep yours
[08:24:09] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> I'm lost. All I know is Magit "gone ... done ... onto" stuff and I dunno. :shipit: üí©
[08:25:16] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> Uhh... wait! I think I did it? Just need to push to my fork.
[08:30:04] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> Okay. I'll just drop this into the PR comments because I'm a git.

[10:50:12] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> I figured out all of my problems. :)
[10:50:43] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> Most of it due to `/` rather than `:` in my remote URL. üòÑ

[11:37:50] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> it just doesn't look right..

[11:38:14] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> parts of the additions look duplicated
[11:40:12] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> and I don't like the idea of modifying user's ~/.config by a function
[11:40:20] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> users should manually do that
[13:06:52] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> Which lines appear duplicated?
[13:07:30] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> The worked example uses the same lambda and setq as the non-example part.
[13:07:57] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> Fair enough regarding the lambda, that can be removed and instead the user instructed to do it themselves.
