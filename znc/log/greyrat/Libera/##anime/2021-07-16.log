[15:42:20] <hassoon> amigojapan: alright gonna try anydesk anyway$
[15:44:29] <amigojapan> I see fragrantica . Sweet tabacco does smell pretty good
[15:44:41] <amigojapan> Go ahead hassoon 
[15:45:22] <fragrantica> another perspective from someone
[15:45:24] <fragrantica> First on, it‚Äôs a cake-y coconut vanilla that I don‚Äôt love. Then a true, green fresh rosemary note comes in that is AMAZING and I adore, but it fades back into foody cake territory, and the green notes become a bit shrill. Then it changes to sunscreen vanilla. Then it‚Äôs lovely again.
[15:50:29] <fragrantica> it's more enjoyable than wine reviews
[15:52:23] <fragrantica> one would think they were talking about food: Fluffy cloud of sugared vanilla, tonka, orange rind, and spice! like a ginger biscuit that morphed into an orange vanilla cream /custard gelato. Little rose now and then, mild woody base.
[15:52:30] <amigojapan> fragrantica: beaky's tea reviews use interesting vocabulary

[19:42:18] <fragrantica> yes
[19:42:25] <godlevel19> I've tried watching animes like Kaguya sama and I didn't like it
[19:42:53] <godlevel19> I like Fire force. It was amazing
[19:43:18] <fragrantica> maybe romance is not for you
[19:43:37] <fragrantica> even when mixed with comedy
[19:44:57] <godlevel19> I like One outs too
[19:45:11] <godlevel19> liked*
[19:46:13] <amigojapan> fragrantica: I think we have 2 eyes as a redundant system. 3 eyes may be better tho
[19:46:55] <fragrantica> I don't think more eyes is better
[19:48:07] <davic> I want more boobs rather than eyes
[19:50:07] <amigojapan> fragrantica: well. If you lose sight on one eye and you only have one, it is a big problem. But if you have 2 you can still see
[19:51:10] <fragrantica> two eyes is just right
[19:51:19] <amigojapan> Ok
[19:51:50] <godlevel19> Is it related to what I said earlier

[19:55:08] <SpiritOfSummer> I use icechat
[19:55:15] <SpiritOfSummer> and here's the thing, people say it sucks
[19:55:25] <SpiritOfSummer> but when there's a netsplit and you check the main channel
[19:55:25] <godlevel19> Where do you think the strongest weebs chat?
[19:55:40] <SpiritOfSummer> you watch all these other client users get excess flooded back and fourth for 6 hours
[19:55:42] <godlevel19> IRC, Discord or some other platform?
[19:55:44] <SpiritOfSummer> icechat never hada  single error
[19:55:57] <SpiritOfSummer> I know that's not exactly a universal measurement of quality for IRC clients
[19:56:06] <SpiritOfSummer> but so far all I've seen is superiority from icechat, so I keep using it
[19:56:32] <amigojapan> godlevel19: IRC is where the more mature people hang out

[20:56:10] <ButterNoodle> theholyduck: the mini?
[20:56:23] <theholyduck> i mean the mini is ok. but i suggest getting the full size one
[20:56:31] <theholyduck> we have 6 of them at the makerspace
[20:56:35] <theholyduck> and they are pretty bulletproof
[20:56:42] <theholyduck> even with complete knuckleheads using them
[20:57:11] <theholyduck> https://shop.prusa3d.com/en/3d-printers/180-original-prusa-i3-mk3s-kit.html they do cost quite a bit more than a cheap printer from china
[20:57:13] <ImoutoBot_> [title] Original Prusa i3 MK3S kit
[20:57:23] <theholyduck> but in ex change you do get a warranty that is worth a damn if you fuck up 
[20:57:29] <theholyduck> and a printer thats extremely well tested
[20:57:57] <ButterNoodle> yea I want something that just works..
[20:58:05] <ButterNoodle> with decent tolerances
[20:58:11] <theholyduck> yeah i think the prusa is what you want then
[20:58:27] <theholyduck> its a fun kit to build aswell
[20:58:28] <ButterNoodle> nice 750 is not a terrible price
[20:58:37] <theholyduck> ButterNoodle: i mean. it definitly isnt for how good it is
[20:59:01] <theholyduck> but like broke students everywhere prefer the sub 300 chinese printers that requires 150 dollars in part to make half as good as this
[20:59:10] <theholyduck> and a ton of tinkering
[20:59:10] <theholyduck> :D
[20:59:28] <ButterNoodle> its not a stupid build.. like have to make parts on something else to put it together?
[20:59:41] <theholyduck> you get absolutely everything needed. you just need to screw stuff together
[20:59:42] <theholyduck> basicly
[20:59:46] <theholyduck> with great instructions
[20:59:47] <ButterNoodle> nice..
[21:00:18] <ButterNoodle> I have subtractive prototyping experience.. the additive stuff is a new ball game
[21:00:29] <theholyduck> it comes with a high quality printed booklet  but. https://help.prusa3d.com/en/guide/1-introduction_176529 theres also a full online guide if you want aswell
[21:00:31] <ImoutoBot_> [title] Prusa Knowledge Base
[21:00:38] <ButterNoodle> and then programming that stuff..
[21:00:42] <theholyduck> the 1 thing i suggest is if you have real tools. use those
[21:00:48] <theholyduck> it comes with a set of tools that CAN build it
[21:00:53] <ButterNoodle> naa
[21:00:56] <theholyduck> but like they use pliers to tighten nuts 
[21:01:00] <theholyduck> instead of a nut driver
[21:01:02] <ButterNoodle> I have a garage full
[21:01:09] <ButterNoodle> I use to be a machinist
[21:01:14] <theholyduck> then you are golden
[21:01:17] <theholyduck> the default tools WILL work :P
[21:01:38] <theholyduck> but i used a quality philips screwdriver. a quality nut driver and good quality hex drives
[21:01:46] <theholyduck> instead of the stuff that came in the package
[21:01:50] <ButterNoodle> I prefer using tools that I have a good "hand feel" for - calibrated elbow to torque
[21:01:51] <theholyduck> makes it much nicer
[21:02:02] <ButterNoodle> tru tru
[21:02:38] <ButterNoodle> I have a small tool box that is just for dealing w small fasteners.. bc one phillips bit does not drive them all
[21:02:44] <theholyduck> anyways. the instructions are great. 
[21:03:05] <theholyduck> well written. with common pitfalls. and stuff
[21:03:36] <ButterNoodle> good. I can follow instructions.. and instructions written by non english native speakers with all the china stuff I have bought over the years
[21:04:00] <theholyduck> ButterNoodle: the whole 3d printed parts thing for the prusa is PARTIALLY a gimmick. but its partially how they make their printers so bulletproof
[21:04:17] <theholyduck> since they use like several hundred of the printers in a farm to print the parts for all the printers they test
[21:04:30] <theholyduck> any new upgrades they develop get like hundreds of thousands of print hours on them
[21:04:35] <theholyduck> in days
[21:04:49] <ButterNoodle> *I have to find more practical uses before I drop 1K on one... miscellaneous brackets isnt enough to justify the spend
[21:04:49] <theholyduck> and so the printers they make end up being really bulletproof
[21:05:06] <theholyduck> ButterNoodle: i mean 90% of the things are brackets 
[21:05:10] <theholyduck> that i print anyway
[21:05:16] <theholyduck> i ahve 2 things i want to attach
[21:05:25] <theholyduck> i do measuring and go
[21:05:40] <ButterNoodle> and that has been the other prob, havent wanted to spend money on something I had to work on every time I need to print 
[21:05:59] <theholyduck> yeah i just design and press print
[21:06:06] <theholyduck> and out comes the thing
[21:06:20] <ButterNoodle> what software do u use to model?

[21:10:10] <Bco1981> very
[21:10:10] <ButterNoodle> or morbidly obese?
[21:10:22] <Bco1981> very chubby
[21:10:39] <ButterNoodle> yes.. that gives me a chubby
[21:10:52] <Bco1981> not sure if the belly is supposed to make her look pregnant or fat...
[21:11:02] <ButterNoodle> either way
[21:11:04] <theholyduck> ButterNoodle: i use fusion 360 personally
[21:11:09] <theholyduck> its free for hobby use
[21:11:15] <theholyduck> it has all the things you want
[21:11:16] <ButterNoodle> I mean.. u cant get a pregnant girl pregnant twice...
[21:11:53] <ButterNoodle> wow thats autodesk.. does it integrate with autocad?
[21:12:14] <theholyduck> nope
[21:12:37] <theholyduck> i mean you can export from 1 to the other
[21:12:47] <theholyduck> and they do a lot of the same things
[21:12:55] <ButterNoodle> ye.. 
[21:13:08] <ButterNoodle> I did cad in uni
[21:13:12] <ButterNoodle> so that shit should be ez
[21:13:27] <theholyduck> i mean i think a big part of the skill set is learning to think about cad modeling the right way
[21:13:40] <theholyduck> the tool you use is somewhat secondary
[21:14:14] <ButterNoodle> yep.. 3d modeling was new when I was doing it.. solidworks was just starting to take over
[21:14:22] <theholyduck> ButterNoodle:  like one of the things i teach at the makerspace. 
[21:14:39] <ButterNoodle> thats the point of the production process.. from design to production
[21:14:40] <theholyduck> is how important it is to consider drawing in a.. i dunno what the correct term is
[21:14:43] <theholyduck> parameter driven way?
[21:15:05] <theholyduck> like. instead of typing all your througholes in a model as 4mm. 
[21:15:06] <ButterNoodle> production process is there to make what is designed
[21:15:10] <theholyduck> you type them as "main hole diameter"
[21:15:15] <theholyduck> and then define hole diameter as 4
[21:15:16] <theholyduck> mm
[21:15:27] <theholyduck> that way if you later decide that actually what we need are 5mm holes

[21:15:37] <theholyduck> you change 1 value and all the holes derived from that change
[21:15:39] <ButterNoodle> I used cad with cli
[21:15:57] <ButterNoodle> and coordinates.. object grouping was later on
[21:16:02] <theholyduck> and similarly. define the most important spacing things you can 
[21:16:04] <ButterNoodle> *layering
[21:16:10] <theholyduck> if your holes should be edge defined or center defined
[21:16:14] <theholyduck> from the edge of the model
[21:16:17] <Bco1981> confirmed, it's to look pregnant.
[21:16:25] <ButterNoodle> dicks out Bco1981
[21:16:26] <ButterNoodle> dicks out
[21:16:49] <ButterNoodle> man.. new tools probably make that shit ez
[21:16:57] <theholyduck> i mean autocad is still somewhat CLI based
[21:17:03] <theholyduck> or atleast it still has a commandline
[21:17:12] <theholyduck> fusion is a more "Modern" tool

[21:17:20] <ButterNoodle> solsubs
[21:17:24] <ButterNoodle> jfc
[21:17:33] <ButterNoodle> I am remembering early 3d modeling in acad
[21:17:47] <theholyduck> ButterNoodle: i mean thats my MAIN way of modeling in fusion aswell sorta :P
[21:17:56] <theholyduck> i usually draw 2d planes and then extrude from them
[21:18:02] <theholyduck> and then draw planes on the 3d model
[21:18:07] <ButterNoodle> you would build the model blank.. and use other 3d objects to subtract holes, rounds, fillets.. 
[21:18:08] <theholyduck> and extrude on those 
[21:18:27] <ButterNoodle> nice.. I remember that stuff all too well
[21:18:38] <theholyduck> its not the only way of doing work in fusion ofcourse
[21:18:46] <theholyduck> but i generally prefer it
[21:18:58] <ButterNoodle> ye thats the engineering way
[21:19:27] <theholyduck> anyways. fusion 360 is free for anyone using it to make less than i think the limit now is like 1000 dollars?
[21:19:28] <theholyduck> a year
[21:19:37] <theholyduck> as in. if you arent using it for any real profit
[21:19:40] <theholyduck> but just as a hobby
