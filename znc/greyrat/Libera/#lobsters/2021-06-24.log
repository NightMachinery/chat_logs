[02:38:19] <alb> ghurabah: yeah, if you don't want any random intern to access your data, either you use a provider you trust a lot to get this right (there wouldn't be many I do), and/or it's probably worth doing

[02:39:49] <badtuple> not technical as much as political, but depending on your situation then being able to throw around the term "encrypted at rest" is like magic for certain lawyers, auditors, and credentialers.
[02:41:14] <alb> ghurabah: I use a thing I wrote (https://blitiri.com.ar/p/kxd/) for doing that. There are other projects that do similar things. I don't know of a better way, tbh, because the alternative is either store the key on another disk (kinda defeats the purpose of encrypting it in the first place), or I have to manually ssh in and unlock it (which I don't want to rely on :)

[02:43:26] <alb> ghurabah: what you're doing in your VPS might be subject to regulatory compliance that requires the data to be encrypted at rest, OR you could have clients that require it, OR insurance that gets cheaper if you do it, etc.
[02:43:39] <ghurabah> I see now

[03:49:03] <hoistbypetard> that one kept them away until I ditched the land line, mostly because the burst of sound followed by a pause fooled the software that was detecting live answers and caused the call to be transfered to a representative that they had to pay a few cents to hear out the message.

[04:16:45] <hoistbypetard> as to why you can still do so in 2021: offshore call centers

[06:33:11] <hoistbypetard> cb: once the killfile guided anarchy of usenet became untenable, some of the stuff migrated to this weird half-assed mashup of onion remailers and listservs to die
[06:33:17] <manicennui> usenet, IRC, and mailing lists were full of great discussion.
[06:33:29] <hoistbypetard> it'd have been better to keep the other kind of anarchy :/
[06:33:38] <manicennui> So many dead IRC channels now.
[06:33:52] <manicennui> And the ones that moved to other platforms are mostly dead on those platforms too.
[06:35:16] <cb> i think everyone who wasn't a grognard went to web based forums
[06:35:21] <cb> and now they died a usenet death

[06:36:16] <companion_cube> hoistbypetard: yeah… sadly now it's dead and the youngins use facebook
[06:36:24] <lkhrs> or reddit
[06:36:44] <lkhrs> really sad - I started on web-based forums and built several, now it's hard to find an active one that isn't a support forum
[06:37:47] <hoistbypetard> it's funny. one thing that was much easier about even a moderated usenet group than a web forum was passing the torch once the moderator/operator/whatever you want to call it was done
[06:39:31] <pushcx> What was easier about passing the torch on usenet?
[06:39:33] <hoistbypetard> this conversation made me go look up one of my favorite old cypherpunk grognards... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_C._May

[06:40:55] <hoistbypetard> pushcx: adding someone to the moderator's address felt easier in practice than transfering a site's database/hosting/etc
[06:46:20] <manicennui> Seems like Google does a decent job of preventing spam to non-usenet groups.
[06:46:22] <hoistbypetard> our gaggia espresso machine alt.coffee offshoot fared better through the transfers than its web-based offspring did, anyway
[06:46:30] <manicennui> Clojure and Racket both use Google Groups.
[06:46:33] <lkhrs> hoistbypetard: You didn't have to do the same if the USENET server changed owners?
[06:50:35] <hoistbypetard> not as long as it was distributed widely... you just had to change who was on the receiving end of the moderator address
[06:51:01] <hoistbypetard> if it was a private one on something like the mozilla.* hierarchy things were different

[15:16:24] <valentinus> I was trying to make a command-line application the other day in Python. I had a data structure which represented my state and I had some functions which changed the state and some functions which rendered the state to the screen. Anyway, I didn't use `class` keyword once in Python to do this. Am I coding it "wrong"?
[15:18:39] <valentinus> Whenever I see some Python code in the wild, it's not like what I wrote at all. Since I'm new to coding, I was wondering what the correct way to code is.

[17:20:47] <johnhowell> I'm glad there is still remote work, I'm dealing with some recruiters this morning from various Linkedin leads. My only 2 requirements be: no customer interaction, and remote 99% of the time (I don't mind coming in once a month)

[17:24:52] <wink> thanks, never heard that either :P
[17:25:17] <johnhowell> Small-med businesses hire us to do IT instead of hiring an in house guy. We cost ~2k/month while an in house guy costs 3-4k/month
[17:25:49] <johnhowell> and they get access to our whole team, etc etc. It's somewhat of a new business model, I just forget about it cause I work in one lol
[17:25:52] <wink> interesting, I think we don't have such a term in German and that is one that's not been adopted
[17:26:38] <besnn> in house == US-based?
[17:26:47] <wink> sounds just like "external computer guy/company" that has been a thing since the 80s though

[17:27:27] <johnhowell> wink: That's exactly what it is, and 2 of our guys where external computer guys in the 80s lol
[17:27:30] <iDrougge> Which is one reason much statistics indicate that the service sector is growing whilst the industrial sector is shrinking.

[20:38:15] <adamcstephens> I’d resisted running my own forge locally, since bare repos are pretty easy to manage. I ended up installing gitea recently because it has push to create repo, which saves me the step of creating one at all. I’m very happy with it. Easy to set up, but flexible enough in configuration for what I needed.

[20:40:57] <adamcstephens> I’m not really using the webui. gitea stores the repos as regular repos on disk, which is nice
[20:41:08] <badtuple> Surely there's super lightweight layers over git. Like just for permissions to a repo and serving a read-only lightweight viewer for your group of contributors.

[22:48:12] <c355e3b> shapr!
[22:48:18] <shapr> oh, fighting with kubernetes, but I think we declared a draw
[22:48:22] <shapr> howdy c355e3b
[22:48:33] <mouseghost> got into emacs as a normal daily driver :D
[22:48:37] <mouseghost> its pretty awesome
[22:48:38] <c355e3b> kube fights are the usual
[22:48:48] <mouseghost> like a game of chess, shapr?
[22:48:58] <meff[m]> I watched a presentation on Mercury once and it seemed really complicated
[22:49:14] <shapr> Ah, I'm in a different part of the country for a funeral, so I won't have any spare time until next week at best :-(
[22:49:25] <c355e3b> sorry to hear that
[22:49:30] <shapr> Are we talking about Mercury the programming language?
[22:49:46] <mouseghost> :(
[22:49:47] <c355e3b> seems that way
[22:49:53] <meff[m]> yeah, the Mercury language
[22:49:58] <c355e3b> So I was very close to sticking it into production once
[22:50:07] <meff[m]> Wow, Mercury in production?
[22:50:15] <shapr> one of my friends used to get paid to write Mercury, somewhere in Australia
[22:50:22] <c355e3b> meff[m]: yeah
[22:50:39] <c355e3b> If you do anything manufacturing related logic programing is amazing
[22:50:54] <c355e3b> never got to publicly talk about it because it would piss off the vendors we used
[22:50:57] *** mycroft- is now known as mycroft
[22:50:59] <meff[m]> Oh you don't need to sell me logic programming heh
[22:51:09] <meff[m]> Mercury is just what interests me here
[22:51:25] <shapr> I vaguely recall that friend telling me that Mercury used unification to do thread synchronization
[22:51:27] <shapr> sounded neato
[22:51:36] <shapr> I like prolog
[22:51:38] <c355e3b> it had some nice self checks for a purchasing system
[22:51:48] <c355e3b> i ended up with prolog/minizinc
[22:51:56] <c355e3b> because one would compile and the other was understandable
[22:52:02] <meff[m]> Hahaha
[22:52:10] <shapr> wow
[22:54:00] <shapr> I like smt solvers

[22:55:41] <meff[m]> I've used OR-Tools and MiniZinc for great fun/success in the past
[22:55:52] <meff[m]> and Z3
[22:55:53] <shapr> I've never used or-tools, I keep meaning to try them
[22:55:56] <shapr> I have definitely used z3

[22:56:07] <mockturtle> [ Shae Erisson’s blog - Part two of SMT Solvers, Integer Linear Programming ] - shapr.github.io
[22:56:27] <meff[m]> The Python OR-Tools bindings are quite nice. Haven't really used any of the other bindings
[22:56:30] <shapr> but it turned out I didn't need an SMT solver for that problem :-(
[22:56:35] <meff[m]> I'm forgetting what solvers it works with under the hood
[22:56:36] <shapr> it was integer linear programming :-/
[22:56:45] <meff[m]> shapr: 😀 haha been there
[22:57:51] <meff[m]> The Prolog/WAM execution model at least makes sense in my mind. It's a lot harder with solvers to optimize queries without just raw experience, from what I can tell
[22:58:10] <meff[m]> Mercury I don't know enough about actually writing code in
