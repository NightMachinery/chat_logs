[03:29:24] <Khepra> at least now the 15th standard is well known.   venv module and pip. nothing else.

[03:46:32] <Khepra> I still use it because the apps are set up like that for years now, and "if it ain't broken...."
[03:46:37] <slowly_stuck> nginx + gunicorn is the preferred method? I'm gonna go start learning some nginx now

[03:47:46] <Khepra> slowly_stuck: I think it's much easier to get help. mod_wsgi has historically had some bugs and wasn't really performing well. uwsgi was damn fast and powerful/featureful app server, but feature creep ate it inside out. gunicorn, and lately async and greenlets, is where the "cool kids" are :)
[03:48:26] <slowly_stuck> I'm terrified of cool kids. They very often don't all decide to stay on the same tech stack until 8 years from now when I have my next problem.
[03:48:29] <Khepra> #pocoo on "the node that shall not be named" was usually helpful for nginx+gunicorn in context of flask. not sure where they went after the schism, here to libera or OFTC
[03:49:33] <Khepra> oh no, yeah I remember know. they fled irc altogether. discord now.  pfffffffft.
[03:50:15] <slowly_stuck> Eww discord. is there an IRC<->Discord bridge yet?
[03:50:41] <Khepra> don't give them ideas :))
[03:51:09] <slowly_stuck> I might go with uwsgi for boring stability (even at the expensive of a possibly more complicated initial setup) https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/deploying/uwsgi/. Anyway, today's the day to learn nginx. Thanks!
[03:51:54] <Khepra> it's dead simple to set it up. except I hate uwsgi on debian, by default it's still using ancient sysv scripts and concepts thereof. I wroter my own systemd units and it works like a charm.

[08:27:26] <somiaj> check /etc/modprobe.d/nvidia-blacklists-nouveau.conf, modify that file and change 'blacklist noveau' to 'blacklist nvidia' and reboot, you'll be using the nouveau drivers

[09:21:06] <mishehu> greets.  quick question about dbgsyms packages and gdb'ing a core file.  I had the opensips-dbgsyms package installed on a server when a coredump occurred.  but an underlying dependency's dbgsym package was not at that time installed.  I have installed it, and reloaded the core file in gdb, but I don't see any mention of the new dbgsym in the core
[09:21:26] <mishehu> should I be seeing both the opensips-dbgsym package one as well as the underlying dep's now?

[16:21:09] <ychaouche> and making sure I correctly understand the output of aptitude search
[16:21:16] <Blondie101010> the only time package managers install stuff you didn't ask for is when you install something that includes package recommendations or dependencies
[16:21:43] <randall> ... and in that case they're marked as "piA" in the aptitude list.
[16:21:55] <ychaouche> I was reading about it here : https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/aptitude/ch02s02s02.en.html, it says second character is action to be taken, and when that value is "i", then aptitude will install it

[17:21:48] <maxtim> I have some samba shares that con only be accessed when I have a vpn enabled. I just learned of systemd.mount and systemd.automount, I figured I would use those to create lazy mounts. I'd like the mount point to exit and not attempt to mount again unless the vpn is enabled. Is this possible?

[18:12:40] <amacater_> Whatever comes up: a lot of people seem to like terminus in a terminal - but these days, a bunch of folk use VSCode. Your choice is almost endless - just pick something that distinguishes l and 1 and is easily legible
[18:13:18] <maxtim> and O and 0
[18:14:01] <pingpongball> #emacs is best
[18:15:05] <amacater_> Code layout wars are endless - fit in with co-workers or project style if there is one. It _really_ matters for, say, the style of the Linux kernel - but layout and indentation need to be readable. Use a code beautifier if it helps.

[18:17:10] <randall> pingpongball: You want a monospace font that will distinguish between 0 and O, and l and I. I use "Monospace Regular", Roboto also works nicely.

[22:56:14] <dpkg> When you get random packages from random repositories, mix multiple releases of Debian, or mix Debian and derived distributions, you have a mess.  There's no way anyone can support this "distribution of Frankenstein" and #debian certainly doesn't want to even try. See https://wiki.debian.org/DontBreakDebian and <reinstall>

[22:58:53] <mannequin> i didn't know installing just few packages will have so serious consequences
[22:59:18] <greycat> Kernels are pretty safe.  They don't have many dependencies.

[23:17:56] <jmcnaught> !partial downgrade
[23:17:56] <dpkg> This may or may not work for you, but if you've got nothing to lose then try it: (a) change sources.list (b) aptitude update (c) aptitude and then search for the upgraded packages, hit enter on them, select the correct version (d) do the same for libc6 (e) search for broken packages by pressing "b" and then fix them in the same way (f) once you have no more broken packages, hit 'g'.

[23:32:29] <amacater_> You can try "apt-get remove [foo] && apt-get install [oldfoo]" - the apt-get remove has to succeed to then install the older versions. Downgrades aren't supported: I'd try removing single packages as a dry-run and see what each removes
