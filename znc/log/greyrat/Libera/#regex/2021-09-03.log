[12:50:54] <digitok> [\S\s]

[12:53:18] <digitok> 07arash, if you just want to match a literal newline, \n
[12:53:36] <digitok> [\S\s] can be used in place of . to match any char including newlines
[12:54:06] <purplex> \s can search newline as well
[12:54:06] <purplex> I prefer \R
[12:55:00] *** Joins: Dus10 (~dus10matr@2001:470:69fc:105::a7d)
[12:55:39] <arash> digitok, thank you. and i have another question, what is the difference between \r and \n ?!
[12:56:24] <Me-me> \r is only used in certain applications under certain conditions. It is a legacy from a time when there was a characterised difference between a new line and a carriage return, i.e., mimicking typewriters.
[12:56:52] <Me-me> And you will also almost always see \r paired with \n anyway.
[12:57:23] <arash> Me-me, thank you
[12:57:28] <Me-me> Happy to help.
[12:58:36] *** Joins: psydroid (~psydroid@user/psydroid)
[12:59:41] <Gurkenglas> python's re only has fixed-width lookbehind, re.sub replaces the entire match, i find myself needing to do ~ s/(ab+)(c+)(d+e)/\1\3/g instead of s/(?<=ab+)c+(?=d+e)//g, that is silly, right?
[13:00:10] <purplex> yep in old days \r had a real purpose (it gets cursor to left position in newline), now it remains attached to \n, arash (afk)
[13:00:38] <Me-me> Gurkenglas: That's a common workaround, yes.
[13:00:54] <Me-me> s/yes/, so no it's not silly/

[13:01:01] <Me-me> Dangit, punctuation.

[13:15:29] <purplex> but its still relevant even today, I used \r in my console c++ program to set the cursor. (arash)
[13:15:38] <purplex> Gurkenglas which message?
[13:16:55] <arash> purplex, i see. thank you
[13:17:44] <purplex> Glad to help!
[13:18:20] <Gurkenglas> purplex, it should answer /msg rebot s/answer/foo/ with Gurkenglas meant: rebot should foo /msg queries
[13:21:36] <purplex> you want to privately message s/ and have correction appear in main chat?
[13:21:43] <purplex> not recommend.. i think
[13:21:58] <Gurkenglas> no, i want it to reply in /msg, so that one can test out a correction.
[13:22:21] <purplex> just to test how /s works i see.
[13:23:05] <purplex> well its pretty simple
[13:24:50] <purplex> so you'll test it say 10 times until you find a correct one then use it in main chat, seems that's your idea
[13:25:25] <Gurkenglas> yus
[13:27:13] <purplex> best to use * because by then chat will be over :p
[13:27:59] <Gurkenglas> you underestimate the speed of desperation. Whatcha mean by *?
[13:29:13] <Me-me> purplex is assuming the context of you using the s/// function and is suggesting you use * for corrections instead of testing the s/// function 10 times.
[13:29:51] <Me-me> Because by the time you have, he is suggesting, the topic of conversation will have shifted.
[13:30:37] <Gurkenglas> Yes, the unclear part was how to use * for corrections, but he just meant "say *foo to the chat, people will understand"
[13:31:06] <Me-me> Right. So for example, if I was to say tyop deomn
[13:31:10] <Me-me> *typo
[13:31:11] <Me-me> *demon
[13:31:15] <purplex> you never used * for correction, Gurkenglas?
[13:34:17] <Gurkenglas> I have, but in context it didnt occur to me because i thought we had the common goal of using regexes for fun overkill :D
[13:35:22] <Gurkenglas> (Did you know? Discord natively supports s/// for message editing.)
[13:35:36] <purplex> yep i sensed that was the bigger motivation (to push \s buttons like a game) rather than honestly caring about correction.
[13:35:53] <purplex> yes discord does that > right click > edit
[13:36:37] <Gurkenglas> To be clear: You write "s/foo/bar/" in the chatbox and instead of posting that to the channel it edits your previous message
[13:37:31] <digitok> you can type s/// more than once if you get it wrong

[13:38:21] <digitok> but your previous msg will still be stored, you'd just have to make sure your regex couldn't also match your last s/// attempt
[13:38:31] <Gurkenglas> yeah but sometimes on #haskell someone horribly embarasses himself with repeated lambdabot mistakes and there one can /msg lambdabot :)

[19:31:05] <re101-beetle-14> Hey Everyone! I just started learning Regex and the Regex101 site. Unfortunately, during my first use of the platform I saved two links while unauthenticated and did not make note of the delete link. Is there anyway to have these links taken down? Thank you in advance for any insight!
[19:32:28] <Me-me> Unfortunately not. I continue to advocate for link expiry but the site owner is adamant about it.
[19:33:48] <re101-beetle-14> Ah thats what I gathered from reading the git. Are you aware if the data gets cached in Google? In one of the git issues it seemed like that issue was fixed.

[19:59:15] <digitok> ok then all you can probably do is contact the site owner with some details of the post and see if he can help
