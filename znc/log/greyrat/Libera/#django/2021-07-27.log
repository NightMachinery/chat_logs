[02:17:38] <Steve-Dusty> FunkyBob, you should write a blog on how to configure your settings and stuff to get ready for deployment
[02:17:56] <Steve-Dusty> Right now I'm just reading from Django For Beginners last chapter on configuring for deployment
[02:19:26] <FunkyBob> there's a section in the django docs for that :P
[02:19:38] <doismellburning> it's very good
[02:20:23] <FunkyBob> Steve-Dusty: so, was trying to catch you y/day to query why your view wasn't using choice_set...
[02:20:30] <FunkyBob> no idea what your code looks like now :)
[02:20:45] <FunkyBob> you made a comment as to you knowing what _set does... but your code wasn't using it, oddly
[02:21:11] <Steve-Dusty> I replaced ones that can use _set after you reminded me
[02:21:19] <FunkyBob> k
[02:21:25] <Steve-Dusty> https://github.com/Steve-Dusty/django-polls
[02:21:27] <Steve-Dusty> here's my code
[02:21:28] <Steve-Dusty> im done
[02:22:00] <FunkyBob> next we'll introduce you to class-based generic views :)
[02:22:08] <FunkyBob> since it seems you've a fairly good grasp on basic views
[02:22:35] <FunkyBob> https://github.com/Steve-Dusty/django-polls/blob/main/polling/views.py#L91
[02:22:45] <FunkyBob> note here you can explicitly name the aggregate, so you don't hav to figure it out
[02:23:13] <Steve-Dusty> wdym?
[02:23:58] <FunkyBob> instead of having to know how django would construct the name votes__sum...
[02:24:18] <FunkyBob> you could use aggregate(total_votes=Sum('votes')).get('total_votes')
[02:24:25] <FunkyBob> Explicit is better than implicit.
[02:24:41] <FunkyBob> if you don't know the reference, run "python3 -m this"
[02:24:45] <Steve-Dusty> ik
[02:24:56] <Steve-Dusty> oh...
[02:26:02] <FunkyBob> (also, I hate your indenting of dicts... but hey:)
[02:26:32] <FunkyBob> https://github.com/Steve-Dusty/django-polls/blob/main/polling/views.py#L98-L104
[02:26:33] <Steve-Dusty> Idk if it's prettier
[02:26:35] <FunkyBob> i don't think this is right
[02:26:37] <Steve-Dusty> or something else
[02:26:44] <Steve-Dusty> I think i have pep8
[02:26:46] <FunkyBob> you're overwriting context each loop
[02:27:06] <Steve-Dusty> OH
[02:27:09] <Steve-Dusty> IT SHOULDNT BE INDENTED
[02:27:16] <FunkyBob> Steve-Dusty: for formatting, I'd put each item on its own line... it's a bit easier for humans to scan, AND it means less commit noice when you update
[02:28:16] <Steve-Dusty> I got a `Total votes: None`
[02:28:28] <Steve-Dusty> when I tried the explicit thing
[02:29:14] <FunkyBob> you made both changes on the line?
[02:29:28] <FunkyBob> if it works, it works...
[02:29:37] <FunkyBob> was just mentioning it's possible, and why I would prefer it
[02:30:14] <Steve-Dusty> I did `    total_votes = question.choice_set.aggregate(Sum('votes')).get('total_votes')`
[02:30:21] <Steve-Dusty> and it total_votes returned none
[02:30:39] <FunkyBob> so no, you didn't make both changes
[02:30:51] <FunkyBob> aggregate(total_votes=Sum('votes'))  <-- see here where I named the aggregate
[02:30:54] <FunkyBob> total_votes=
[02:31:09] <FunkyBob> in that way it's _explicit_
[02:31:23] <FunkyBob> rather than implicit... in that to know the name you have to know django's naming scheme
[02:31:38] <Steve-Dusty> ohh
[02:31:44] <Steve-Dusty> saw that on the docs example
[02:32:03] <FunkyBob> both ways work equally wekk
[02:32:05] <FunkyBob> well
[02:32:19] <FunkyBob> but can you see that for a future dev re-reading the code... one way might take less brain to understand?

[04:10:40] <Steve-Dusty> the hardest part of deploying to heroku is `git push heroku main`
[04:10:56] <Steve-Dusty> you ALWAYS get an "error: src refspec master does not match any .."
[04:11:04] <Steve-Dusty> no fucking way...
[04:11:49] <Steve-Dusty> not 1 time in my life I've ever deployed an app on the command line to heroku without this error. literally not even 1 time
[04:17:18] <Steve-Dusty> why are there so many branches...
[04:17:24] <Steve-Dusty> what's the difference between master and main...
[04:19:41] <nedbat> Steve-Dusty: slow down and take a deep breath. we can help
[04:20:11] <Steve-Dusty> my book tells me to `git push heroku master` but my github branch is `main`
[04:20:14] <nedbat> Steve-Dusty: master and main are two options for what to call the default branch in a git repo. you wouldn't have both
[04:20:29] <b-rex> Steve-Dusty: main is the woke version of master. master got banned like 6 months ago because it's racist or something
[04:20:31] <Steve-Dusty> and when I do git push heroku master I get showed "error failed to push some refs into..."

[05:49:32] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: i asked to a customer manager of my company. they said there is no way to track each single item
[05:49:41] <wallbroken> you can only track the model using the SKU
[05:49:56] <FunkyBob> imagine that
[05:50:17] <wallbroken> so, if you want to identify each single t-shirt, you can't
[05:50:19] <FunkyBob> but you were insistent they said that's what they needed
[05:50:37] <wallbroken> no, that's not my committent of the project
[05:50:49] <wallbroken> that's a customer of my company where I work
[05:50:49] *** Joins: PaulWay[w] (~PaulWay@2001:44b8:1110:f800:4b79:e11c:c2f:5c75)
[05:51:33] <FunkyBob> ok, i have no idea what you're talking about, now
[05:51:58] <FunkyBob> anyway, I have to go wrestle with jest/react testing bullshit
[05:52:03] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: at my work, my official work, we build Product lifecycle management software
[05:52:16] <wallbroken> for fashion company
[05:52:34] <wallbroken> and i asked to one of them is it's there a way to identify items
[05:53:04] <FunkyBob> well, in  your shoe example you said there were serial numbers
[05:53:13] <FunkyBob> i doubt you'd do that for t-shirts and skirts
[05:53:15] <tm007> wallbroken: you gotta split your paycheque with FunkyBob  and others!
[05:53:21] <FunkyBob> tm007: heh
[05:53:43] <tm007> jest is nightmare man!
[05:53:45] <tm007> struggling
[05:53:45] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: yes, mine was just a general purpose question
[05:54:19] <tm007> Error: Encoding not recognized: 'cesu8' (searched as: 'cesu8') in jest
[05:54:29] <tm007> solution on the internet doesn't work for me :|
[05:54:55] <FunkyBob> what is that encoding supposed to be?
[05:54:56] <wallbroken> but that's strange you cannot identify each single item
[05:55:05] <wallbroken> imagine you have a production defect
[05:55:09] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: if there's no assigned identifier... then no, it's not
[05:55:14] <wallbroken> you cannot identify all the items with that defect
[05:55:24] <tm007> This is problem caused by mysql2 doing dynamic lazy require of encodings and Jest not being able to handle this.
[05:55:29] <tm007> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46227783/encoding-not-recognized-in-jest-js
[05:55:29] <FunkyBob> typically defects are tracked by batch number for items without a serian#
[05:55:40] <FunkyBob> tm007: ah
[05:56:02] <tm007> it's the same solution everywhere on the internet and I'm stuck
[05:56:07] <FunkyBob> tm007: no, I'm getting the apparently ubiquitous "update inside a test was not wrapped in act(...)"
[05:56:10] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: for example all cars have its own serial
[05:56:20] <wallbroken> all the mobile phones have its own serial
[05:56:28] <wallbroken> to identify each single item
[05:56:30] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: yes, but my underpants don't
[05:56:32] <tm007> I'm trying to setup a testing culture in my company!
[05:56:42] <wallbroken> idk why it's not for t-shirts
[05:56:45] <tm007> And I'm struggling with jest myself
[05:57:01] <tm007> Nobody writes tests in this company :|
[05:57:05] <FunkyBob> tm007: jest itself isn't the struggle, I think... not here, anyway
[05:57:07] <FunkyBob> tm007: :(
[05:57:15] <tm007> Only me and my boss a little bit
[05:57:18] <PaulWay[w]> wallbroken: yes, but cars and phones will also have a 'stock-keeping unit' or SKU.
[05:57:27] <FunkyBob> tm007: usually it takes testing catching one major regression or site breaker... to get people on board
[05:57:29] <PaulWay[w]> Every item with the same SKU is functionally identical to another.
[05:57:49] <PaulWay[w]> I.e. if someone came in with a bad phone/car/shoe, you'd give them a replacement with the same SKU.
[05:57:54] <tm007> Unfortunately it's all about the delivery here
[05:57:56] <FunkyBob> tm007: basically "this test just saved your reputation."
[05:57:59] <tm007> Things do break often
[05:58:14] <FunkyBob> tm007: well, if the culture accepts breakages... testing won't happen
[05:58:15] <tm007> Since it's not a super critical site, so no problem!
[05:58:37] <tm007> Yeah
[05:58:44] <tm007> Fighting a lone battle
[05:58:47] <domhnall> PaulWay[w]: hm, interesting! I've worked in a warehouse before and never knew what SKU was an acronym for. Thanks.
[05:58:54] <tm007> To teach the Aussies some testing lol
[05:59:36] <tm007> domhnall: what's the term you guys used?
[05:59:48] <domhnall> just SKU ... "check the SKU number"
[05:59:55] <PaulWay[w]> domhnall: always handy to find these things out.
[05:59:58] <domhnall> "skew"
[06:00:00] <tm007> right on
[06:00:06] <domhnall> PaulWay[w]: yeah
[06:00:34] <FunkyBob> tm007: gimme the word, me 'n the lads will rock over with baseball bats and test tutorials :P
[06:00:44] <PaulWay[w]> Ironically, I use SKUs for the items I wood turn, but each one is unique so there's only ever one item with each SKU.
[06:01:03] <tm007> Company is hiring!
[06:01:07] <tm007> FunkyBob:
[06:01:23] <PaulWay[w]> But I have had instances where I've had to replace an item and I'd basically just fit that 'new' item into the same SKU as the old one (that broke or whatever).
[06:01:50] <tm007> how do you guys track defects/returns?
[06:01:57] <tm007> Does the SKU go up by 1?
[06:02:05] <tm007> Is there a separate db table for defects?
[06:02:19] <PaulWay[w]> Well, that's where you'd differentiate by serial number.
[06:02:31] <PaulWay[w]> The serial number should be unique across your entire range.
[06:02:40] <tm007> Right
[06:02:50] <PaulWay[w]> That's where you'd use an Auto ID field in Django or a UUID if you hated yourself.
[06:03:12] <FunkyBob> yeah... as I tried to explain to wallbroken the other week
[06:03:21] <FunkyBob> you can't order with serial#... but you can ship with it
[06:03:22] <PaulWay[w]> Yep.
[06:03:32] <FunkyBob> [indeed, a company I used to work with did just that... with a system i wrote in ZOPE]
[06:03:45] <PaulWay[w]> Ah, good old Zope.
[06:03:47] <FunkyBob> despatch would scan the S/N for each item shipped
[06:03:55] <PaulWay[w]> I'm explaining this so that maybe wallbroken can learn from examples.
[06:03:59] <tm007> Never heard of Zope before
[06:04:04] <tm007> sounds dope
[06:04:08] <PaulWay[w]> It's nope.
[06:04:15] <PaulWay[w]> :-)
[06:04:18] <tm007> hahah
[06:04:48] <tm007> > Auto ID field in Django or a UUID if you hated yourself.

[07:29:28] <dre> try just disable collectstatic and see if it still launches alright.
[07:30:45] <FunkyBob> oh, you're not using dj-database-url?
[07:31:43] <FunkyBob> the issue does seem to be the env var is not set...
[07:31:49] <FunkyBob> odd that they wouldn't
[07:32:28] <FunkyBob> Steve-Dusty: is it  your config that tells it to run collectstatic?  or herokus?
[07:33:02] <FunkyBob> [or use a env solution that doesn't asplode like that]
[07:33:10] <Steve-Dusty> im using `dj_db_url`
[07:33:16] <Steve-Dusty> `
[07:33:16] <Steve-Dusty> DATABASES = {
[07:33:17] <Steve-Dusty>     'default': env.dj_db_url('DATABASE_URL')
[07:33:17] <Steve-Dusty> }`

[07:33:27] *** Quits: IceMichael (~IceMichae@dynamic-046-114-152-034.46.114.pool.telefonica.de) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[07:33:34] <dre> iirc they run collectstatic in a release phase. but i don't think the db is available during that.
[07:33:35] <FunkyBob> seems it's from the environs package, going by the traceback
[07:33:38] <Steve-Dusty> `from environs import Env
[07:33:39] <Steve-Dusty> env = Env()
[07:33:39] <Steve-Dusty> env.read_env()
[07:33:40] <Steve-Dusty> `
[07:33:45] <FunkyBob> Steve-Dusty: don't paste in here
[07:33:48] <Steve-Dusty> ok
[07:33:52] <dre> also I've never seen dj_db_url but that's a seperate thing.
[07:34:01] <FunkyBob> https://pypi.org/project/dj-database-url/
[07:34:22] <dre> the issue is purely that the ENVVAR doesn't esist and I really just think it's because your app is in a mini 'release phase' that heroku does.
[07:34:24] <Steve-Dusty> idk man im just doing what my book's asking me to
[07:34:27] <dre> I used to run heroku all the time.
[07:34:34] <FunkyBob> and which book is that?
[07:34:42] <Steve-Dusty> William S. Vincent's Django for Beginners
[07:35:01] <Steve-Dusty> it's completlely CBV
[07:35:03] <FunkyBob> perhaps find a way to give feedback to them that their solution doesn't work for current heroku
[07:35:17] <FunkyBob> CBV to the exclusion of all others?  then i object to it already
[07:35:35] <dre> Steve-Dusty, change your code to have sqlite default db, and if "DATABASE_URL" is set, then use that.
[07:35:52] <dre> also i feel iffy about "environs"
[07:36:02] <dre> just use straight normal os.env
[07:36:13] <Steve-Dusty> the official docs use environs..
[07:36:34] <FunkyBob> Steve-Dusty: you mean the django docs?  where?
[07:37:10] <dre> Steve-Dusty, "environs" is a third party package. "os.env" is the python standard library. both do the same thing. but one is "standard"
[07:37:22] <Steve-Dusty> nevermind
[07:37:23] <Steve-Dusty> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Deployment
[07:37:26] <Steve-Dusty> i got confused with this
[07:37:31] <FunkyBob> Steve-Dusty: or are you Steve Jobs? because you  are both called Steve
[07:37:42] <FunkyBob> Steve-Dusty: pass a default to dj_db_url() so it can safely fall back
[07:37:56] <FunkyBob> sqlite:// should be safe enough
[07:38:16] <dre> FunkyBob, I have wondered about that, can you just do "sqlite://"  ?
[07:38:23] <dre> would be nice if possible
[07:38:25] <Steve-Dusty> wut
[07:38:29] <Steve-Dusty> pass a default?
[07:38:30] <dre> ie blank username password
[07:38:32] <FunkyBob> dre: in-memory sqlite instance, I believe
[07:38:33] <Steve-Dusty> dj_db_url is the default
[07:38:38] <dre> neat
[07:38:41] <FunkyBob> Steve-Dusty: ys... something to use when DATABASE_URL doesn't exist
[07:38:56] <dre> this presumes that dj_db_url accepts a default
[07:39:07] <FunkyBob> looking at the docs, it does
[07:39:12] <Steve-Dusty> https://github.com/Steve-Dusty/django-polls/blob/6ed1b48dfada0e2c30937e2ad2093bcdbd47b983/polls/settings.py#L90
[07:39:25] <FunkyBob> but their https://github.com/sloria/environs#usage-with-django
[07:39:40] <FunkyBob> Steve-Dusty: ytes... pass a default to the call to dj_db_url
[07:39:42] <Steve-Dusty> oh that's what u mean
[07:39:52] <dre> Steve-Dusty, https://github.com/sloria/environs#basic-usage
[07:39:59] <dre> look at the "providing a default value"
[07:40:11] <Steve-Dusty> https://dpaste.org/oVRe
[07:40:13] <Steve-Dusty> like thsi?
[07:40:22] <FunkyBob> right
[07:40:24] <dre> perfect
[07:40:51] <dre> afaik you don't need the "default=" but doing so is much nicer imo. explicit is better than implicit
[07:40:52] <Steve-Dusty> ok
[07:41:17] <Steve-Dusty> setting a default wouldn't help with my case though...
[07:41:25] <Steve-Dusty> it wouldnt prevent the problem
[07:41:40] <Steve-Dusty> I want it to use Postgre
[07:41:52] <dre> it would because it would stop the error; We're assuming that the function throws an error because it 1. couldn't find the VAR, and then 2. didn't have a default.
[07:42:25] <dre> Steve-Dusty, this is only used while it is collecting static files. ONCE it has done everything it needs to, and the runserver is happening, then the DB_URL will be up as expected.
[07:42:42] <Steve-Dusty> so i'll push it now
[07:42:53] <dre> you've connected a postgresql addon to the heroku dynamo yes? you should see in the config vars for the heroku app that it will have the database_url
[07:43:01] <Steve-Dusty> no..
[07:43:04] <Steve-Dusty> it doesnt shw
[07:43:46] <Steve-Dusty> should i add it manually?
[07:44:18] <Steve-Dusty> nvm
[07:44:20] <Steve-Dusty> it showed
[07:44:21] <Steve-Dusty> I added it again
[07:45:05] <dre> Steve-Dusty, I think once you get past the release error, the db should be able to boot up as normal, and THEN you get the db_url
[07:45:14] <Steve-Dusty> gtg eat
[07:45:24] <Steve-Dusty> errored even with default :(
[07:45:47] <dre> same error? lol
[07:45:52] <Steve-Dusty> https://dpaste.org/kyqa
[07:46:42] <dre> ok different error. do what it says: `pip install dj-database-url` on local, then `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
[07:47:15] <dre> gtg work
[07:47:16] <FunkyBob> freeze?  are we barbarians?? :P
[07:47:47] <dre> I am, most definitely
[07:49:11] <dre> FunkyBob, what do you use for virtual envs? I never understand why anyone looks past the standard venv package.
[07:49:28] <dre> i get that it only came out in 3.6 (?) but that was yonks ago already.
[07:49:32] <FunkyBob> dre: venv
[07:49:37] <dre> venv is da bes
[07:49:41] <FunkyBob> though for package development I find poetry is really nice
[07:50:00] <FunkyBob> for deploys i'm "python3 -m venv" all the way
[07:50:08] <dre> yeah I tried a bit of that. was ok.

[09:23:23] <FunkyBob> copious amounts of confluence documents
[09:23:29] <FunkyBob> it's far from ideal
[09:24:08] <Steve-Dusty> from now on I'll design a system before coding django :(
[09:24:16] <Steve-Dusty> what tools do you recommend?
[09:24:20] <Steve-Dusty> or should I draw by hand
[09:24:40] <FunkyBob> diagrams aren't the only solution
[09:24:56] <Steve-Dusty> what else?
[09:24:57] <FunkyBob> documentation, as well as comments, go a long way
[09:26:08] <Steve-Dusty> did you do systems design for the ecommerce site too?

[09:26:16] <FunkyBob> nope
[09:26:27] <FunkyBob> well, not at first
[09:26:28] <Steve-Dusty> someone did it for you and then you followed it?
[09:26:40] <Steve-Dusty> what's that website called again?
[09:26:41] <FunkyBob> no,m it was all too agile... specs changing day by day

[09:27:58] <Steve-Dusty> i forgot
[09:28:52] <Steve-Dusty> not coding but systems design
[09:29:26] <FunkyBob> if you want to see what nightmare evolves when you don't understand the project specs... look at what happened with wallbroken
[09:29:47] <FunkyBob> so sometimes a project design is knowing what the goals are
[09:30:15] <FunkyBob> holy shit, it's 3pm already
[09:31:23] <Steve-Dusty> it's 10PM here
[09:36:40] <FunkyBob> 3pm is generally when I finish work
[09:37:05] <Steve-Dusty> when do you start??
[09:37:17] <FunkyBob> 7am
[09:37:51] <Steve-Dusty> oh
[09:38:26] <Steve-Dusty> do you need to learn about the deployment process in your work?
[09:40:34] <Steve-Dusty> use*
[09:40:37] <Steve-Dusty> because DevOps handle it
[09:40:52] <dre> you still need an understanding of what they're doing
[09:40:58] <dre> at a fundamental level
[09:41:37] <FunkyBob> "DevOps handle it" means you don't understand devops :)
[09:41:58] <FunkyBob> but yes, I did overhaul out deployment process... albeit, I'm only in charge of our front-end code currently
[09:42:22] * FunkyBob still believes devops is a process, not a role
[09:42:52] <Steve-Dusty> how do u do that
[09:43:09] <Steve-Dusty> * Steve-Dusty thinks he's pro gamer
[09:43:30] <hemebond> FunkyBob: Isn't that exactly what it is?
[09:43:36] <hemebond> A process I mean.
[09:43:54] <FunkyBob> hemebond: and yet, people keep referring to it as a role
[09:44:04] <FunkyBob> Steve-Dusty: /me
[09:44:09] * FunkyBob waves at Steve-Dusty 
[09:44:17] * Steve-Dusty steb so nice
[09:44:19] <hemebond> Yeah, they usually seem to mean a DevOps systems engineer when they refer to it as a role.
[09:44:44] <hemebond> When did the term systems engineer fall out of use?
[09:48:12] <Steve-Dusty> what's the Controller in MVC?
[09:48:48] <FunkyBob> it's the part that implements the business logic to react to user input from the view
[09:48:52] <FunkyBob> and affect updates on the model
[09:48:59] <FunkyBob> why are you meddling with MVC?
[09:49:02] <serafeim> hello friends
[09:49:06] <FunkyBob> morning, serafeim
[09:49:32] <Steve-Dusty> because why isn't it MVT
[09:49:34] <Steve-Dusty> model view templates
[09:49:46] <FunkyBob> because MVT was a tongue-in-cheeck comment
[09:49:55] <FunkyBob> and MVC doesn't apply to server-side web frameworkds
[09:49:57] <FunkyBob> -d
[09:50:03] <Steve-Dusty> wut
[09:50:20] <Steve-Dusty> i still don't understand controller. does it represent the templates?
[09:50:21] <serafeim> i've come to understand that all this terminology (MVC and friends) is mainly academic and doesn't offer anything to a practical developer
[09:50:28] <serafeim> just learn the framework you want and you'll be fine
[09:50:39] <FunkyBob> serafeim: I disagree... but yes, learn the framework :)
[09:50:49] <FunkyBob> Steve-Dusty: if ytou're trying to apply those terms to Django.. don't
[09:51:01] <FunkyBob> as I said, the MVC pattern does not fit server-side web frameworks
[09:51:08] <dre> acronyms aren't helpful, but underlying patterns is good to know
[09:51:09] <FunkyBob> despite all the nonsense propagated by various tools
[09:51:10] <serafeim> FunkyBob: most frameworks hold your hand and help you make the right decisions
[09:51:14] <Steve-Dusty> then why do they call Django an MVC
[09:51:34] <PaulWay[w]> Because it is.
[09:51:36] <FunkyBob> serafeim: yes... a good framework aspires to (a) protect you from the tedious stuff, and (b) protect you from the dangerous stuff
[09:51:40] <FunkyBob> Steve-Dusty: because they're wrong
[09:51:52] <PaulWay[w]> OK, I'll defer to FunkyBob here :-)
[09:51:56] <FunkyBob> Steve-Dusty: because other tools latched onto MVC, when they weren't.. as a buzz term
[09:52:08] <FunkyBob> when what they really wanted to say was "a pattern embracing separation of concerns"
[09:52:11] <PaulWay[w]> I would call Django an MVC, but maybe my definition of MVC is simple.
[09:52:13] <Steve-Dusty> so what should django be called?
[09:52:25] <serafeim> FunkyBob: yes i think MVC was mainly used for client apps
[09:52:29] <FunkyBob> PaulWay[w]: it's not... MVC is a unidirecitonal flow... Model -> View -> Controller -> Model
[09:52:48] <FunkyBob> serafeim: yes, MVC makes perfect sense in GUIs... many JS frameworks are MVC, though they'll never use that term
[09:52:48] <PaulWay[w]> Right.  Yeah, that I get.
[09:52:54] <FunkyBob> because it's been made toxic

[09:53:11] <FunkyBob> PaulWay[w]: Django is MVA ... Model / View / Adapter... aka Mediating Controller
[09:53:21] <PaulWay[w]> OK.
[09:53:29] <FunkyBob> because the "Adapter" (view)  mediates between the View (browser) and the Model
[09:53:48] <Steve-Dusty> My plan for summer was to learn Django and React and tailwind CSS
[09:53:53] <PaulWay[w]> We have models, we have the 'view' (templates / serializers in DRF) and the 'adapter' (views) between them.

[09:54:51] <FunkyBob> Steve-Dusty: not really, no
[09:54:57] <FunkyBob> I know of it, and some of its basic shapes
[09:54:57] <Steve-Dusty> so..
[09:55:01] <Steve-Dusty> you know React..
[09:55:05] <FunkyBob> I use my own API tool
[09:55:11] <FunkyBob> yes, I know React, for $DAYJOB
[09:55:11] <Steve-Dusty> oh
[09:55:12] <Steve-Dusty> what's that?
[09:55:17] <FunkyBob> django-nap
[09:55:24] <Steve-Dusty> you use React with django-nap API?
[09:55:26] <serafeim> i'm lucky that i don't need to use react
[09:55:27] <PaulWay[w]> It's the short pile on some fabrics.
[09:55:31] <PaulWay[w]> ;-)
[09:55:34] <FunkyBob> I've used nap with Vue... and Svelte...
[09:55:53] <FunkyBob> I only use React for work, who [despite employing two of the django core team] don't use django
[09:55:58] <FunkyBob> (not that we haven't tried :)
[09:56:08] <PaulWay[w]> I'm interested in trying HTMX out.
[09:56:13] <Steve-Dusty> WHAT
[09:56:17] <dre> So am I
[09:56:19] <Steve-Dusty> your company employs 2 django core team members?

[09:56:47] <Steve-Dusty> you're a django core team member?
[09:56:48] <dre> FunkyBob, do you have an example repo of Vue/djagno
[09:56:52] <FunkyBob> he's quick this one...
[09:57:00] <FunkyBob> dre: sadly, no, it was for a client

[09:57:34] <dre> idk it was a long time ago and I haven't tried it again
[09:58:03] <dre> FunkyBob, I couldn't "just let up and give json responses" - I wanted to try and merge the template / vue / tailwind together into the templates.
[09:58:12] <FunkyBob> have webpack build into a dir y ou add to staticfiles_dirs... and life tends to go easy from there
[09:58:19] <FunkyBob> ah, well
[09:58:22] <FunkyBob> there's your problem :P
[09:58:31] <serafeim> i'm creating a JS-heavy app right now and it's only using jquery + vanilla js libs. here's for example a Grid component: https://dpaste.org/kLEK
[09:58:46] <FunkyBob> yikes
[09:58:46] <dre> tailwind is OK, but vue wasn't, not nicely. Although I'm tempted to try out that HTMLX that PaulWay[w] links.
[09:58:53] <FunkyBob> people still use jquery in greenfields projects?
[09:58:55] <serafeim> i'd be crazy to use react, vue or anything else.
[09:58:57] <serafeim> FunkyBob: of course.
[09:59:07] <FunkyBob> why?

[09:59:29] <Steve-Dusty> im back
[09:59:30] <serafeim> FunkyBob: because i forget the syntax for `$('#id')`. and because a lot of components depend on jquery
[09:59:34] <dre> I don't get react.
[09:59:38] <Steve-Dusty> yes same
[09:59:42] <FunkyBob> document.querySelector('#foo')
[09:59:54] <serafeim> dre: yes i know but it's vanilla js (doesn't even have jquery there)
[10:00:01] <Steve-Dusty> funky are you better at Python or JS?
[10:00:12] <FunkyBob> Python
[10:00:24] <serafeim> FunkyBob: ha ha yes i know. there may be a couple more. but the thing is that i don't use jquery for anything heavy. just to select elements
[10:00:48] <FunkyBob> serafeim: I find with querySelector and querySelectorAll ... I've got most of it
[10:01:02] <FunkyBob> though I _really_ wish they'd make all the sequences/iterables share an interface
[10:01:08] <FunkyBob> instead of having to Array.from() lots of things
[10:01:12] <Steve-Dusty> funky how many programming langs do u know
[10:01:21] <Steve-Dusty> should I learn R U S T?!
[10:01:22] <FunkyBob> afk
[10:01:23] <dre> I hate vanilla js.
[10:01:29] <serafeim> i was thinking of dumping jquery and changing it with something like this: https://news.ycombinator.com/hn.js ... but since I need jquery for datepicker and datetimepicker (and some other components) then i just bite the bullet and use it
[10:01:29] <FunkyBob> i love vanilla js
[10:01:36] <Steve-Dusty> i hate react
[10:01:40] <serafeim> i also love vanilla js. it has become really powerful.
[10:01:51] <Steve-Dusty> dre then what do u use
[10:01:57] <dre> I take it back. I do like vanilla js. but I hate JS in general.
[10:02:08] <Steve-Dusty> did you learn JS in college?
[10:02:09] <Steve-Dusty> or self taugh
[10:02:24] <dre> Steve-Dusty, python, and no, everything is self taught. I learnt robotics in college.
[10:02:31] <serafeim> JS is not considered an important language. they dont' teach it in universities
[10:02:37] <dre> ^
[10:02:51] <dre> JAVA all the way, starting from 4, all the way to 7.
[10:03:01] <serafeim> universities teach c/python/java/pascal. and maybe C++/Lisp/Ada/Prolog
[10:03:07] <dre> nb: i don't know java
[10:03:08] <PaulWay[w]> Java is a terrible thing to do to young minds.
[10:03:15] <serafeim> i've never heard of a university teaching JS. it's a total mess
[10:03:19] <dre> yes it's really quite tragic.
[10:03:27] <serafeim> PaulWay[w]: yes you need to start with something more basic like pascal
[10:03:36] <PaulWay[w]> I always like Steve Yegge's rant about Java.
[10:03:41] <serafeim> or even basic
[10:03:47] <PaulWay[w]> I started with... BASIC...
[10:04:08] <serafeim> yes me too i learned basdic before like 30 years. but my programs were a complete mess of GOTOs.
[10:04:30] <dre> I started with C++. I found out about python and hated it because I thought it was a language for babies and I need my curly braces.
[10:04:52] <dre> then when I went through uni I found out that I love python because it's a language for babies and I don't need my curly braces.
[10:04:53] <serafeim> C++ is a very difficult lang to start with. you'll just use it like C
[10:05:12] <dre> serafeim, I learnt and gave up all pre-C++11 days
[10:05:27] <dre> now it just looks alien to me
[10:05:31] <serafeim> lol
[10:05:51] <dre> auto it&& = ()[]{cout << "what the fuck" << endl; };
[10:06:04] <shangxiao> I started with... LOGO...  (the one where you move the turtle around)
[10:06:11] <serafeim> i had learned C++ using the book "Learn C++ in 21 days" before 20 years or something. the book's title may seem funny but for me it was a revelation because because of that book I properly understood OOP
[10:06:29] <Steve-Dusty> im learning robotics using arduino
[10:06:33] <serafeim> if i was a teacher today i'd give that book to people that wanted to undedrstand OOP
[10:06:41] <Steve-Dusty> Java is stupid af eats ur RAM
[10:07:07] <GinFuyou> oh, logo was fun. I did it for school grad exams.
[10:07:55] <shangxiao> I think that was the best way to introduce programming to 6/7 year olds in the 80's :)
[10:08:20] <Steve-Dusty> >  language for babies and I need my curly braces.

[10:09:10] <dre> https://www.qut.edu.au/
[10:09:24] <Steve-Dusty> is UCSD good
[10:09:54] <dre> it was a great uni. but I didn't get along with other students in my "tier". pompous asses.
[10:10:51] <dre> Steve-Dusty, it really doesn't matter tbh. I think get in to whatever's close, affordable, do your time and get out
[10:11:09] <Steve-Dusty> want to try get into an Ivy League
[10:11:15] <dre> if you're living at home it makes things easier, but you've got to have a job as well. number 1 thing to be employable after uni is have a job.
[10:11:35] <Steve-Dusty> i'll be doing ROTc
[10:11:36] * dre shrugs * 
[10:12:11] <dre> no feeling about that; I wanted to do great in uni but circumstances put me otherwise. If you can then go at full-ball.

[18:36:16] *** Quits: domhnall (~developer@user/domhnall/x-2887755) (Quit: leaving)
[18:37:50] <bmbouter[m]> So I'm trying to search for all Users who have two specific Permissions and I'm not so great with databases
[18:38:09] <bmbouter[m]> lol ... what an opening statement
[18:41:20] <bmbouter[m]> I tried doing something like this `User.objects.filter(Q(user_permission=Permission(pk=1) & user_permission=Permission(pk=2))`
[18:42:02] <bmbouter[m]> but the issue with this is that it always yields [] because there will be no single record that is equal to two permissions because each user_permission ManyToMany is actually two records
[18:42:57] <elmcrest> bmbouter[m] with `Permission(pk=2)` you are creating a Permission instance
[18:43:00] <elmcrest> same for 1
[18:43:29] <elmcrest> that's wrong even if it might work...
[18:44:09] <elmcrest> also, did you try with double underscore - not sure but might have to be `user__permission=p1` or so
[18:44:20] <elmcrest> p1 = Permission.objects.get(pk=1)
[18:45:30] <bmbouter[m]> my example is a bit simplified in exactly the way you're pointing out. In practice I already have those actual instances and I wasn't sure how to easily show that
[18:46:25] <bmbouter[m]> to make it clearer let me write it like this:    `User.objects.filter(Q(user_permission=perm_a & user_permission=perm_b)`    where `perm_a` and `perm_b` are both instances of `Permission`
[18:47:02] <bmbouter[m]> so this does work `User.objects.filter(Q(user_permission=perm_a))` which is also equivalent to this `User.objects.filter(user_permission=perm_a)`
[18:47:24] <bmbouter[m]> and `User.objects.filter(user_permission=perm_b)` yields the same user (one who in my DB actually has both perm_a and perm_b
[18:47:29] <elmcrest> you could also use dpaste.de or something and paste your actual code, that'd be most helpful
[18:48:51] <bmbouter[m]> I'd have to write a simplification because this code is using data provided in various places
[18:49:40] <bmbouter[m]> oh I know what I can do let me use the interactive shell some and paste that
[18:49:51] <bmbouter[m]> that'll give a real example!
[18:49:57] <elmcrest> User.objects.filter(Q(user_permission=perm_a)&Q(user_permission=perm_b)) should work
[18:50:20] <elmcrest> still not sure about the _ vs __ thing... but yeah, the shell is your friend
[18:50:46] <bmbouter[m]> I also thought it would but it doesn't and I even know why. it's because it's two records
[18:50:58] <bmbouter[m]> let me demonstrate with the shell one min
[18:51:26] <elmcrest> ok
[18:51:34] <elmcrest> include potential error messages
[18:52:16] <elmcrest> yeah, should be __
[18:52:24] <elmcrest> so two underscores
[18:52:43] <bmbouter[m]> user_permission is an attribute I believe?
[18:52:52] <elmcrest> oh
[18:52:58] <elmcrest> on user?
[18:53:14] <elmcrest> do you use the builtin stuff or some custom permissions implementation?

[19:00:48] <bmbouter[m]> check this out https://dpaste.org/sDiB

[19:03:18] <bmbouter[m]> I have my theory about why this doesn't work, but I'll just ask:   why doesn't this work? each individual Q() returns user_a .... Q() & Q() returns []
[19:04:50] <elmcrest> interesting
[19:05:24] <elmcrest> might be inside the Permissions model, might be a bug?
[19:05:46] <elmcrest> but since this faisl silently I'm not so sure what's going on here
[19:05:53] <elmcrest> let me try to reproduce it
[19:07:03] *** Joins: simplicity (~yti@user/simplicity)
[19:08:44] <bmbouter[m]> oh wait my example is not working like my testing yesterday was.... maybe I did something wrong there
[19:09:23] <bmbouter[m]> L#18 is correctly yielding user_a. and my example is not great because user_a has both perms of interest and user_b has none
[19:10:07] <bmbouter[m]> I remember now. the concern I had was that this doesn't handle a situation where user_a has perm_a and user_b has perm_b, the qs would result in returning both user_a and user_b in that case which is not what I need I need to know which users have both!
[19:10:15] <bmbouter[m]> let me demonstrate this and paste again...
[19:12:07] <elmcrest> got it working like that `User.objects.filter(user_permissions=p1).filter(user_permissions=p0)`
[19:12:23] <elmcrest> not sure why the version with the Q object fails
[19:12:38] <elmcrest> also if using the OR from the Q object I get the same user twie
[19:12:39] <elmcrest> also if using the OR from the Q object I get the same user twice

[22:18:14] <CodenameTim> bmbouter: Does `filter(user_permissions__in=[perm_a, perm_b])` give you the results you're expecting?
[22:19:35] <bmbouter[m]> it does! but I need to check one more thing too, let me check check it
[22:19:50] <CodenameTim> finster: Shift your perspective on how you're doing the check. You can manipulate the current time by the delta, then use that to compare to the stored field.
[22:20:42] <bmbouter[m]> CodenameTim: oh yeah this is the issue with that, so I need to be sure that user_a has both perm_a AND perm_b, and this will yield results even if a user has one OR the other
[22:20:47] <CodenameTim> `if now >= (field + delta)` is the same as `if (now - delta) >= field`
[22:21:13] <bmbouter[m]> and my db fu is weak
[22:21:26] <finster> CodenameTim: oh, wow. I'm dumb
[22:22:29] <CodenameTim> bmbouter, yeah that's a bit trickier. It might be possible to do the operation on the `through` model.
[22:23:41] <bmbouter[m]> yeah this is where I struggle
[22:24:50] <CodenameTim> Never mind. I don't think that would work either.
[22:26:07] <bmbouter[m]> yup me neither
[22:26:10] <bmbouter[m]> I was just trying
[22:26:23] <bmbouter[m]> I think it has to use a SubQuery of some kind
[22:28:19] <finster> CodenameTim: got it running! thanks a ton!
[22:28:31] <CodenameTim> finster: You're welcome
[22:30:13] <CodenameTim> bmbouter: So I think you need to count the number of permissions exist, then match that to the values you're attempting to fetch. This SO answer describes the solution from a SQL perspective: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15977126/select-group-of-rows-that-match-all-items-in-a-list
[22:30:30] <CodenameTim> match* not exist.
[22:30:41] <Steve-Dusty> when should I start learning CBVs
[22:30:50] <Steve-Dusty> I already know how FBVs work
[22:31:02] <Steve-Dusty> and practiced it with 2 projects
[22:31:06] <Steve-Dusty> am I ready?
[22:31:45] <bmbouter[m]> CodenameTim: that is a great idea! I'm going to try this now
[22:31:48] <bmbouter[m]> this makes sense

[23:02:28] <Steve-Dusty> should you commit your pipenv files to github?

[23:10:36] <Steve-Dusty> what's wrong?
[23:14:29] <Steve-Dusty> I keep getting this PATHs problem..
[23:20:47] <Steve-Dusty> there's no answers regarding this on the internet
[23:21:05] <Steve-Dusty> also, when I `pip3 install django` multiple times on my regular shell and still kept getting "django not found"

[23:21:37] <withered_wolf> @Steve-Dusty I would almost recommend starting with CBV's! I wish I would have!
[23:21:41] <Steve-Dusty> i forgot the export command to export django to path. Why do I see answers for Windows when I look up "adding something to path"
[23:22:04] <Steve-Dusty> withered_wolf I started with CBVs following my book but then used FBVs
[23:22:15] <Steve-Dusty> it's hard
[23:23:13] <withered_wolf> I find that CBV's help make my life easier in a bunch of ways and speed up my development. YMMV obviously :) I just like how handy they are... a few lines and bam, view is up and data is there.
[23:23:48] <withered_wolf>  
[23:24:06] <Steve-Dusty> can you put FBVs and CBVs together?
[23:24:32] <withered_wolf> In the same app but use different ones for different views? yeah.
[23:25:13] <withered_wolf> Sometimes there are situations where a FBV just fits better. For what I do most? I find CBV's to be perfectly suited to the task with writing significantly less code than using FBV

[23:27:40] <Steve-Dusty> why is less code better?

[23:33:09] <withered_wolf> less code (for me) allows me to keep things clean and there's a lot less potential for errors. I let the CBV take care of most of the issues - less try/catches, etc.
[23:33:58] <withered_wolf> Additionally... the more baked in code you have, the more confident you can be that it will work as intended as most all of it is under test IIRC.

[23:41:49] <Steve-Dusty> i think more code = look more hax
[23:41:55] <Steve-Dusty> less code = unimpressive
[23:42:51] <withered_wolf> I want less errors and as much test coverage as I can get while doing the least amount of work ;) more pay, less work :)
[23:47:50] <nedbat> Steve-Dusty: less code is better :)
[23:49:10] <Steve-Dusty> oh
[23:49:35] <nedbat> Steve-Dusty: every line of code is something you have to worry about and fix in the future
[23:52:39] <Steve-Dusty> i thought more code = more cool
