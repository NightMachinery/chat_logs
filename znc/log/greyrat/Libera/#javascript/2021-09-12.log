[00:12:28] <sillyslux__> mehh
[00:12:40] <sheetjs> "was" because the goal is to hammer all of the issues out this weekend
[00:13:06] <sillyslux__> bug smashing weekend?
[00:13:39] <sheetjs> there are easily 30 issues that boil down to timezone issues
[00:14:14] <sheetjs> v8 (node/chrome) does not properly handle timezones that had second-level timezone offsets

[00:15:07] <teut> look there
[00:15:10] <sheetjs> for example, Europe/Paris had an offset of -0:09:21 in the late 1800s and early 1900s
[00:15:11] <sillyslux__> is it just me or is avatars.githubusercontent.com really slow
[00:15:15] <wroathe> > it seems inappropriate to advertise here

[00:16:32] <teut> i ve 200+ lines with Grid with className so  if its dead code I really would want to remove it
[00:16:38] <sheetjs> sillyslux__: it was a larger lack of foresight

[00:17:12] <wroathe> sheetjs: I don't mind it, I'm just saying that we're not breaking new ground here

[00:28:51] <sillyslux__> do you always try to parse as number first?
[00:29:34] <sheetjs> the overarching problem is that some file formats like CSV mix "content" and "presentation"
[00:30:04] <sheetjs> for example you'll have something like "abc,def\n123,456"
[00:30:23] <sheetjs> and the expectation is that cells A2 and B2 are the numbers 123 and 456 respectively
[00:33:35] <sheetjs> you can extend that to currencies like "Price,$123.45"

[01:42:59] <onosendi> That type of question doesn't seem like it should be categorized in "Day 1 of learning JavaScript". The way hackerrank asks questions seems a little ridiculous... maybe I'm just not used to it yet.
[01:43:05] <velix> wroathe: In the past, we've had freelancers for ~$150 per hour, as well as permanent employees for ~$50,000 per year.
[01:43:09] <wroathe> velix: Yup, working from home is great. I'm not suggesting you stop that. I'm just suggesting potential venues to meet development talent outside of work hours.
[01:43:18] *** Joins: h4k1m0u (~h4k1m0u@2a01:e0a:98:ddf0:f3:5b03:6c2b:99)
[01:43:43] <wroathe> But it sounds like meetups aren't happening yet
[01:43:45] <sheetjs> velix: what exactly are you hiring for
[01:44:20] <wroathe> velix: Another possibility would be to reach out to a local staffing firm and see if you can come to some kind of arrangement.
[01:44:33] <wroathe> velix: Love them or hate them, staffing firms are good at building a rolodex of developers
[01:44:40] <KevinX_> 150/hr is.a way better deal than 50k per year full time
[01:44:44] <velix> wroathe: I've been to such meetups in the past, since I'm very keen at geospatial solutions. I'll be happy to visit them as soon as possible.
[01:44:45] <wroathe> velix: And spying on them to keep track of whether they're employed or not :P
[01:44:57] <velix> KevinX_: Yeah, but it's different work of course.
[01:45:06] <velix> KevinX_: The $150 guy was a senior developer with LOTS of experience.
[01:45:12] <velix> He did the work in 1 week, which others took months for.
[01:45:39] <sheetjs> 150/hr -> 300K full time
[01:45:46] <velix> sheetjs: he didn#t work in full time.
[01:45:58] <velix> sheetjs: He worked 2 days a week only because he has built a house.
[01:46:03] *** Joins: comatory (~ondrejsyn@93.99.127.7)
[01:46:14] <velix> So he was 70% doing house stuff and family and 30% coding for us.
[01:46:32] <velix> But his work was really nice. Then covid started and he had to do 100% house and family :(
[01:46:43] <velix> sheetjs: 1 sec
[01:46:48] <KevinX_> so about 16 hours per week? for how long?
[01:46:55] <wroathe> velix: Probably the fastest possible way for you to get a developer on your project would be to work with a professional recruitment (staffing) firm
[01:46:56] *** Joins: smvg (~smvg@85.218.163.88)
[01:47:01] <sheetjs> market is bimodal

[01:47:39] *** Quits: Intelo (~Intelo@88.246.78.218) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[01:47:46] <wroathe> velix: It'll cost more, because the firm will insist on taking a finders fee or a cut of the hourly rate, but it'll very likely be the fastest and best option
[01:48:01] <velix> sheetjs: The bottom line is that we are looking for a front-end developer who can continue our project. The problem is that in the last 4 years it has been created by different developers in different frameworks. From Angular 1 over rxJS to Angular 2 and vanilla JS. But for all I care, they can rewrite the thing completely in React... that will probably be easier than digging into existing code.
[01:48:28] <sheetjs> is the project working?
[01:48:34] <KevinX_> Lots of react devs out there. Shouldn't be hard to find someone
[01:48:34] <wroathe> velix: Are you going to pay them to rewrite it in React :P ?
[01:49:05] <velix> wroathe: I don't care. he even can write it in Vue or Selve or whatever some new framework is he keen in.
[01:49:14] <velix> The project runs and works and has customers.
[01:49:20] <h4k1m0u> Hi everyone, I have a design question, do it happen that you'd export class instances from modules so it's global in the project? or is there a more elegant to inject the variable everywhere?
[01:49:24] <velix> but right now, development is stuck, because there is no developer ;)
[01:49:27] <sheetjs> then what about offering more to the original developers to keep them onboard?
[01:49:28] <wroathe> velix: Those sound like good terms for a contract. Work with a reputable staffing firm, and you're basically guaranteed to find someone.
[01:49:52] <KevinX_> I'm down to rewrite it for $150/hr ;-)
[01:49:53] <velix> sheetjs: That's the point. Those were freelancers or wanted to have short contracts only.
[01:50:08] <sheetjs> if you offered double the rate, they may consider staying longer term
[01:50:13] <velix> sheetjs: We'd love to have a normal employment contract...
[01:50:20] <velix> sheetjs: We do NOT have any "rate limit".
[01:50:24] <velix> They're free to offer anything.
[01:50:29] <velix> But nobody is offering anything :)
[01:50:34] <velix> We had 3 people in several month.

[01:53:08] <KevinX_> where's the job listing. I'll tell you if im qualified
[01:53:24] <velix> sheetjs: Actually, in my job contract it's forbidden to inform others about the payment (even co-workers). I don't think he will tell us, how much he earns now :D
[01:53:43] <velix> wroathe: yeah
[01:53:50] <wroathe> sheetjs: I've heard reports from the staffing firms I work with that they regularly source COBOL developers to maintain legacy systems at a rate > $300 an hour
[01:54:07] <velix> the problem is that staffing corporations also want $$$
[01:54:22] <velix> but better $$ than no coder.

[01:56:19] <wroathe> velix: Sure, you could go international too. There's plenty of firms that operate internationally.

[02:03:28] <velix> KevinX_: I can translate it into English, but it doesn't really say more than this: We are looking for a javascript developer (frontend) for a long term cooperation and further development of our products. You can and should bring in your own ideas and have complete freedom in the choice of frameworks and tools.

[02:06:19] <velix> KevinX_: Sure. It has never been necessary to write an application in English because we had hundreds of applications to similar offers before Covid. I remember in 2019 I had to go through almost 120 applicants.

[02:11:26] <velix> For me, it would even be okay to split off new ideas from the core project. In other words, not integrated. That means you don't have to work your way into an established ecosystem, but can start cleanly from scratch. That's why I'm thinking about offering this on freelancer.com... The main thing is that the development continues. The advantage of an employment is that you get the offers of the university: further education, sports courses, canteen
[02:11:26] <velix> discount, etc.

[02:22:38] <sheetjs> so we ended up absorbing the 4 students assigned to babel

[04:38:12] <theskillwithin> the new bit was the css import btw

[13:39:37] <KevinX> It's weird. I'm trying to think what I would label myself now
[13:39:45] <KevinX> It's contextual though
[13:40:26] <theskillwithin> well its easier when you have a job title with a salary, the label is given to you
[13:41:14] <KevinX> I would say to my mom maybe "I'm a computer programmer" but I would say to someone with more knowledge about computers "I'm a software developer" but to maybe this chat I'd say "I'm a web developer primarily"

[13:42:34] <KevinX> I'm basically a professional debugger
[13:42:59] <theskillwithin> i think in Canada software developer is more popular title, because you need a degree to say "engineer"

[13:54:37] <KevinX> sheetjs true, but less so in professional careers
[13:54:48] <sheetjs> just as much in "professional careers"
[13:55:44] <KevinX> by those I mean literal professional careers like doctors or lawyers. Or maybe that's the traditional definition of professional I guess
[13:55:52] <sheetjs> law is the classic example

[13:57:48] <KevinX> "professional" doesn't necessarily mean ethical if that's the point here
[13:58:13] <theskillwithin> software engineers often have to know many laws
[13:58:15] <sheetjs> "there's a lot of branding and BS involved in our field".  there's a lot of branding and BS involved in every field
[13:58:32] <KevinX> There are supreme US justices that I would say are pieces of shit but still professionals in their field
[13:58:44] <theskillwithin> esp in medical field
[13:58:50] <KevinX> yeah I think we are splitting hairs here
[13:59:12] <KevinX> but it's much easier to fake it in our domain
[13:59:22] <sheetjs> the barrier to entry is low
[13:59:42] <theskillwithin> lol i'd say its harder to fake it in our domain
[14:00:15] <KevinX> well, a surgeon cant fake it past their first operation ;-)
[14:00:45] <KevinX> Depends who the boss is I guess (in our world)
[14:01:07] <sheetjs> "fake it" takes on many meanings
[14:01:51] <KevinX> yeah for sure, that's why it's hard to really define anything
[14:02:04] <KevinX> often I feel like I'm faking it still even now

[21:10:23] <Rockwood> may be you are good in both
[21:10:49] <wroathe> Lately there's been a push in the web development community to minimize the role of CSS, and to treat components in whatever component framework you're using as the principal presentational UI abstraction. For example, styled-componets encourages you to tie CSS properties to a new component, instead of the traditional approach, would would have been to define a .btn { ... } class, and to apply .btn to
[21:10:55] <wroathe> elements that should be styled in that way
[21:11:34] <wroathe> From what I've gathered that debate isn't fully settled yet. There's certainly people in here that prefer to maintain a core set of CSS classes, instead of fully committing to a "styled components" approach

[21:28:31] <wroathe> I remember back in the day reading a book on Javascript that was praising finally being freed from the shackles of table-based layouts, <center>, and <font>. They showed a diagram and extolled the virtues of separating out structure (HTML), from behavior (JS), from presentation (CSS) like they were heralding in a brand new era. It's funny how we've come full circle back to coupling all three together.
