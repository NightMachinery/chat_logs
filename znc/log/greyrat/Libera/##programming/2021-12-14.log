[00:00:45] <decker> though I"m not sure you'd want a java job

[00:01:41] <decker>  for a job? :)
[00:01:42] <BucetaRosa> nobody is gonna charge you to use the site
[00:01:54] <decker> just if you want all the answers in longer compute time
[00:02:06] <sonny> [itchyjunk]: I don't think so, but you have to use the website anyways
[00:02:17] <arahael> [itchyjunk]: it's popular to hate on java - i personally dislike it - but java has a lot of very good things going for it.  if you got a java job it would be a good thing, still.
[00:02:20] <decker> there's free notebook thing
[00:02:27] <decker> there's also jupyter notebooks
[00:03:00] <[itchyjunk]> arahael yes I would totally accept a java job. programming is programming
[00:03:17] <arahael> [itchyjunk]: good to hear!
[00:03:41] <[itchyjunk]> I like cool stuff Wolfram alpha website does, too bad the programming part of it is not free
[00:03:55] <[itchyjunk]> would have been nice to learn to get mathy stuff done there
[00:04:45] <pyzozord> yes I should stop bashing on c++ and rust
[00:04:54] <pyzozord> just because I feel intimidated by them
[00:05:53] <flakland> it's better to directly bash the flaws of the language, so we can prevent the mistakes from propagating into the future

[00:06:41] <[itchyjunk]> yeah the programming language you can use with Wolfram alpha website (I think)
[00:07:17] <vdamewood> pyzozord: You should bash the Bourne-again shell.
[00:07:18] <decker> wolfram player stuff?
[00:07:30] <[itchyjunk]> wait, so it is free? does this let me generate graphs and such like the website generates?
[00:07:31] <pyzozord> flakland: I'm thinking it's ok to discuss the differences and pros and cons, it's less ok to pass a generalized judgement "rust bad" (or "rust good"). But "I don't like rust because of x" on the other hand I think it's fair to say

[00:12:56] <paoda[m]> Yeah I hear you. No issues.
[00:13:40] <flakland> my issue with ieee754 is they don't specify the default rounding mode. sure there IS one, and you can change it, but the other modes probably are not going to be as optimal as the hardwares preferred default
[00:15:13] <[itchyjunk]> (Java) A superclass type can always hold a subclass type but not vice verse, right?
[00:15:36] <decker> [itchyjunk] and you want the complex number graphs with like residue coloring stuff?  like geogebra isn't good enough for graphing ?
[00:15:41] <[itchyjunk]> Animal a = (Animal) (new Dog()); would be valid
[00:15:49] <decker> it's full 3d which with a few sliders can be 4-5D pretty easy
[00:15:51] <[itchyjunk]> decker yes to first part
[00:15:57] <decker> I see
[00:15:57] <BucetaRosa> no need for the cast
[00:15:59] <[itchyjunk]> I've not learned geogebra
[00:16:06] <BucetaRosa> Animal animal = new Dog();
[00:16:08] <decker> it's just math functions ...
[00:16:10] <decker> like desmos

[00:17:13] <[itchyjunk]> are you sure? I thought you had to cast
[00:17:15] <[itchyjunk]> in java
[00:17:17] <decker> would it be hard to write? 
[00:17:22] <BucetaRosa> upcasts are implicit
[00:17:38] <decker> seems pretty fast to do a flood fill graph? or are there a lot of precomputed snapshots?
[00:17:42] <BucetaRosa> C++, Java and most OOP languages allow implicit upcasts (as they should be)
[00:17:42] <[itchyjunk]> oh I thought upcasts applied only to primitives not superclass and such. interesting
[00:19:31] <[itchyjunk]> decker my interest with Wolfram was that it seemed to led me query a lot of things quickly
[00:19:58] <[itchyjunk]> like Laurent series of sin etc. I thought maybe with the script, I could extract like the C_(-1) to get the residue or somesuch

[02:47:53] <nomagno> The Nintendo legal team needs a long vacation
[02:48:02] <KillerWasp> Nintendo absorbing the other games is more monstrous than Kirby.
[02:48:15] <nomagno> They are probably working with 20 year old instructions of "defend our IP. Thanks"

[02:50:54] <kveroneau> Honestly, I do side with the big N when it comes to protecting one's IP, I am sorry to say.
[02:51:01] <nomagno> IP is a dumb concept anyways. I definitely think Nintendo is fully to blame to aggressively exercising their legal rights in a harmful way.
[02:51:26] <kveroneau> How has it "harmed" anyone as you say?
[02:51:59] <KillerWasp> kveroneau: really? you don't know?
[02:52:10] <kveroneau> Sure some indy devs lost their time from their indy games, but most of them should have known that Nintendo will come knocking down their doors with a dozen lawyers, so just don't start huge fan projects like that using an IP you don't have a license to.
[02:52:15] <nomagno> Actively taking down fangames, which they have done, and keep doing, is harmful to both themselves and the dedicated developer scene that builds around their franchises
[02:52:41] <nomagno> Again, a legal right doesn't implicate a moral right
[02:52:51] <kveroneau> Fair.
[02:53:15] <kveroneau> They oddly left Zelda Classic alone since the 90s, not sure how that fan project still exists, but Nintendo is letting it stay.
[02:53:33] <nomagno> And Pokemon Showdown
[02:53:36] <kveroneau> Zelda Classic == Mario Maker for Zelda games.
[02:53:57] <nomagno> Some projects are big enough they would actually notice a decrease in sales, if they ever took them down
[02:54:18] <kveroneau> I've played plenty of really fun Zelda fangames in Zelda Classic, just wish Nintendo would just do an official "Zelda Maker" already.  I absolutely love playing fan games.

[02:56:47] <nomagno> Indeed
[02:57:02] <kveroneau> They shouldn't have stopped that eSport from going on with the mod, as during this current pandemic, there really is no alternative.
[02:57:03] <nomagno> IP basically doesn't expire tough
[02:57:27] <nomagno> Which is why you can't really argue the legal right ever becomes justifiable after a few years

[07:06:51] <oldlaptop> beaky: Did you hear the enterprise-grade logging news? https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-44228
[07:06:52] <bayaz> Title: CVE - CVE-2021-44228 
[07:08:05] <beaky> nice i like log4j it is the enterprise solution to all logging needs
[07:08:10] <sonny> what was the bug?
[07:08:17] <sonny> logic based?
[07:08:57] <oldlaptop> sonny: It parses ${string substitutions} in log messages by default, with one form of ${string substitutions} involving fetching and executing code from the Internet
[07:09:23] <flakland> staaaahhhhhhhhppp
[07:09:29] <sonny> oh wow, yeah that's serios
[07:09:33] <sonny> serious*
[07:09:44] <oldlaptop> and apparently, because enterprise-grade software has moved beyond such things as printf(), it is common to feed user input to this logging function without sanitization
[07:10:19] <oldlaptop> (boring, non-enterprise-grade C programmers have known for eons not to feed user input to printf() as its first argument, and printf() doesn't even have a fetch-and-execute-code-from-the-Internet format specifier)
[07:10:43] *** Quits: RatSalad (~RatSalad@183.82.27.242) (Quit: Leaving)
[07:11:17] <oldlaptop> although it has format specifiers which can be conformantly implemented as fetch-and-execute-random-nasal-demons when misused
[07:12:08] *** Joins: amigojapan (uid86330@id-86330.helmsley.irccloud.com)
[07:13:00] <flakland> yes mr. logger program please start the bash daemon, thx
[07:13:24] <ejjfunky> so ... printf is bad?
[07:13:36] <flakland> all input from network is bad
[07:13:50] <oldlaptop> No, you need to do printf("%s", user_input) instead of printf(user_input), because user_input could have %things in it
[07:13:52] <ejjfunky> what's a good solution then?
[07:14:06] <ejjfunky> ic
[07:14:44] <oldlaptop> This enterprise-grade bug is essentially the discovery that a lot of java code does the rough equivalent of printf(user_input), only worse
[07:14:57] <oldlaptop> (much worse)
[07:15:40] <ejjfunky> you mean, ... print("%s", user_input)?
[07:16:14] <ejjfunky> can printf(user_input) still be exploited too?
[07:16:33] <sonny> that's what he just said
[07:16:36] <ejjfunky> ic
[07:16:46] <sonny> user_input could have a toString() which can do anything
[07:16:52] <ejjfunky> i think i missed the conversation. how is it exploited?
[07:17:07] <oldlaptop> printf(user_input) is, in C a "format-string vulnerability", because user_input could have format specifiers in it
[07:17:26] <sonny> user_input.toString() does a network request or something
[07:17:33] <oldlaptop> these format specifiers can do various things that are interesting to attackers
[07:18:01] <ejjfunky> ic
[07:18:27] <norias> like insert newlines and tabs
[07:18:34] <oldlaptop> The issue in log4j2 and/or its users (I don't think you can assign all the blame to either side here) is somewhat similar, in that the interface supports string substitution, and is being fed user input that could contain the string substitution syntax

[07:20:14] <oldlaptop> flakland: That's the question. Is it log4j2's fault for exposing such an unsafe interface and not documenting its unsafety? Or is it in the users for passing user input to an interface that can't accept unsanitized user input safely?
[07:20:45] <flakland> log4j fault for not handling the format correctly
[07:20:53] <oldlaptop> (printf() format-string attacks could involve buffer overflows, yes - the log4j2 business is, as outlined, much more terrifyingly straightforward than that)
[07:21:14] <oldlaptop> log4j2 is (or was, they've turned it off by default now) behaving as designed
[07:21:29] <flakland> it makes no sense how it's exploitable to me
[07:21:30] <oldlaptop> in that sense it's handling its input "correctly"
[07:21:40] <flakland> unless user is sending in java bytecode ?
[07:22:00] <flakland> is it a shell bug when the output is printed to a terminal?
[07:22:14] <oldlaptop> The user is sending a string that is likely to be logged, like an HTTP request, that contains a ${string substitution} construct.

[07:22:41] <oldlaptop> One of log4j2's string substitution constructs, as a side effect, downloads and executes code from an arbitrary LDAP URL.
[07:23:44] <flakland> isn't LDAP a local net server?
[07:23:46] <oldlaptop> https://html.duckduckgo.com/html?q=log4shell brings up several "writeups", including a surprisingly non-lousy wikipedia article already
[07:24:09] <oldlaptop> There's no reason the LDAP server can't be an attacker-controlled site on the Internet in practice
[07:24:32] <oldlaptop> it's *usually* used as an internal service, but then again it's not *usually* used as a way to attack java things
[07:26:04] <flakland> if we're going to push the blame away from authors of the logging program, could also push the blame on net admins
[07:27:28] <oldlaptop> What, for not blocking outbound ldap connections? Not sure I buy that, really. For one thing, I somehow suspect there are other exploitable things in this substitution mechanism that just aren't so astoundingly low-hanging

[08:25:11] <sonny> python was so simple I could get by for a while just looking up the docs as needed, but that probably just says more about their docs
[08:25:12] <flakland> macros probably
[08:25:20] <beaky> it takes me days to do advent of code whereas all the most important softawre projects like javascript and git were written in under a week
[08:25:28] <kveroneau> Least to say, I wasn't very happy that Python 3.x wasn't properly backwards compatible, and thus I didn't think the langauge was forward thinking enough to be worth continuing to use for my personal projects, as Python 4.x will just make all my Python 3.x code broken.
[08:25:47] <sonny> yeah, I did avoid python for that reason

It's generally pretty quick to slap together a GUI app, and then cross-compile it over to my targets with minimal hassle, and there is really no runtime overhead.

[08:43:57] *** Joins: penguino (~mrpenguin@user/mrpenguin)
[08:44:08] <kveroneau> The OS has a loader which will detect the dynamic libraries a PE needs at runtime, although DLLs can also be loaded during runtime on-demand and aren't directly linked into the binary itself.
[08:44:35] <decker> sonny the're often linked directly to the binary itself by dll name and entry point list
[08:44:53] <decker> windows - allocates a new process, and loads the exe and all referenced dlls
[08:44:55] <sonny> yeah, you determine when though right?
[08:45:08] <kveroneau> There are tools you can get for Windows which will examine the PE binary and give you a list of all the DLLs which were linked at compile-time.
[08:45:08] <decker> pedump is a small utility tht shows imports and exports
[08:45:12] <sonny> it would be silly just to call a bunch all at one time
[08:45:22] <decker> 'depends' is a more gui based tool
[08:45:57] <decker> when?  a lot of cases no... you can still load dll's additionally but that's less common than one would imagine
[08:46:16] <decker> things that support plugins like say notepad++ and vscode might load dll's on demand later
[08:46:17] <kveroneau> That is mostly used for "plugins"
[08:46:43] <sonny> oh
[08:47:28] <sonny> dumpbin will tell you the dlls as well?
[08:47:41] <kveroneau> Generally, during compile time, a list of all needed DLLs is linked into a table within the binary, so the OS loader knows what dynamic libraries are needed when the program is launched.

[08:50:01] <kveroneau> That's what makes Go-lang programs so darn portable, as most of them are just statically linked.

[08:52:23] *** Joins: Trashlord__ (~trash@user/trashlord)
[08:52:44] <kveroneau> On Windows it'd obviously use the Windows API calls.
[08:53:06] <kveroneau> But you'd still need to compile it on each target you want to run it on.
[08:53:07] <sonny> API calls don't require the cruntime?

[08:53:14] <kveroneau> No, of course not.
[08:53:39] <sonny> ok
[08:53:45] <kveroneau> The C Runtime itself on each platform is just a bunch of low-level OS API calls at the end of the day.
[08:54:18] <kveroneau> The C runtime just makes it easier for developers to use these calls in their programs.  If a dev really wants to bypass it and use inline assembly, they bloody can.
[08:54:23] <sonny> I admit that's a clever feature

[08:55:24] <ejjfunky> is inline assembly worth doing? seems like nowadays, the compiler can optimize better than we can

[08:56:13] <kveroneau> ejjfunky, well when writing a runtime, you definately need inline assembly as the compiler isn't going to "magically" know how to call OS functions.
[08:56:27] <decker> ejjfunky it's often not worth it... the cost of maintanence of dozens of possible targets makes it more practicaly just let the compiler figure it out for the platform.

[08:57:23] <decker> kveroneau there's a LOT of programs that have nothing to do with IO or the system.

[08:57:55] <decker> yes there's IO to get into it, but that's not the sort of assembly you'd write
[08:59:18] <kveroneau> All I am trying to say is that the OS level calls need to be coded somehow, not saying that everything in a program is going to perform an OS call, but the OS calls do need to be created in the runtime library.
[09:00:15] <kveroneau> Generally, most devs will not need to write assembly, thankfully.  This is more for writing the OS runtime libraries, which these programs will generally call out to.
[09:00:16] <decker> but they don't because they already are
[09:00:39] <decker> ffmpeg, openssl, libressl, etc all have assembly optimized routines

[09:05:44] <decker> but MS doesn't suport inline assembly in 64 bit...

[09:13:11] <kveroneau> I do believe if you looked at the history of the C language, it was created originally as a macro layer to assist with the then widely used assembly in an attempt to make code more portable.  It was then realized how useful it was, and thus C was born.  I do believe that's how I read it.

[09:17:21] <kveroneau> Some C compilers are sort of built on that original idea.

[13:31:55] <mrig> go into dev and then merge, yes. rebase -i is pretty useful for keeping your own local branch tidy, but best keep away from it on public branches, unless you really understand the consequences of that, you will figure that out fast enough, if you use it on your local work though.

[14:22:30] <GeDaMo> Flow charts are more about control flow than data
[14:22:37] <decker> I never seen anyone seriously program that way.. it's a way to code on paper when not near a computer

[14:23:03] <decker> after a while I just remembered the code anyway
[14:23:35] <GeDaMo> We were supposed to draw the diagram first then write the program based on it but nobody did that, code first then diagram
[14:23:39] <decker> well dataflow models the transforms.. more like a neural network design approach - but streams and shaders can also be data flow diagrams
[14:24:36] <pyzozord> right this stuff is useful as documentation

[18:53:51] <merijn> [itchyjunk]: In the context of math (like Wolfram) it means you can do math on symbols, i.e. variables

[18:55:30] <vdamewood> snake: Ah. Bleh.
[18:55:35] <[itchyjunk]> infiniteOne = 1 : infiniteOne
[18:55:57] <snake> itchy: you can also do infiniteOne = repeat 1
[18:55:57] <merijn> snake: It's not that the really want to cram chocolatey down your throat. It's that there's no one with sufficient experience to build a proper Windows installer that has volunteered their time
[18:56:07] <[itchyjunk]> snake, is that a infinite list?
[18:56:13] <merijn> [itchyjunk]: Yes

[18:56:46] <snake> [0,1..]
[18:56:48] <[itchyjunk]> natList :: [Int]
[18:56:48] <merijn> vdamewood: Yes, because there's a bunch of dependencies that also need to be handled, like a gcc-based linker toolchain
[18:57:05] <[itchyjunk]> you're using inbuilt stuff
[18:57:06] <vdamewood> merĳn: Oh, interesting.
[18:57:16] <oldlaptop> <[itchyjunk]> dude wtf, you can do image procesing right from the command line for wolfram scripting
[18:57:16] <oldlaptop> image processing of what kind?
[18:57:24] <snake> merijn, it also has strange function names, that are different from what is typical in all the languages i use
[18:57:25] <merijn> [itchyjunk]: Wanna blow your mind? Try this in ghci: let fibs = 0:1:zipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs) in fibs"
[18:57:32] <edgar-rft> does wolfram know the list of supernatural numbers?
[18:57:40] <oldlaptop> I mean, I can do lots of "image processing" from the unix commandline, I just need to install imagemagick
[18:57:40] <snake> merijn, like "lines" "unlines" instead of a more generic "split"
[18:57:48] <vdamewood> edgar-rft: Magic 1, Alien 2, and so on?
[18:57:48] <[itchyjunk]> oldlaptop, a few different. detect edges, remove objects in image, change pixel colors etc etc
[18:57:49] <snake> and Join
[18:57:59] <merijn> snake: There are more generic split functions in Data.List
[18:57:59] <snake> merijn, and whitespace is syntax, just like in python
[18:58:09] <merijn> snake: And join is just "mconcat"
[18:58:13] <[itchyjunk]> for example, i can search through wikipedia for all articles containing elephand and put all the countries mentioned into a Country variable
[18:58:20] <[itchyjunk]> then do work with that variable
[18:58:22] <[itchyjunk]> really cool stuff
[18:58:27] <snake> yeah well wehat about calling it "join" like everyone else does?
[18:58:33] <[itchyjunk]> natList = 1 : map (+ 1) natList
[18:58:37] <[itchyjunk]> ta da
[18:58:43] <merijn> snake: You can use braces, but nobody does, because braces and semicolons are just objectively inferior to use
[18:58:49] <merijn> snake: join was already taken
[18:59:04] <snake> its like they took the worst things in language design, added functional programming and monads, and BAM. haskell
[18:59:04] <edgar-rft> vdamewood: I think Steven Wolfram has magic 8 balls :-)

[18:59:14] <jkk> :)
[18:59:29] <edgar-rft> yes /dev/null/
[18:59:31] <merijn> snake: Keep in mind Haskell's use of join predates the existence of Python, Ruby, and JS and therefore you can't really blame it for "names popularised by newer languages already being taken"

[19:00:05] <snake> anyways, i dont like it one bit
[19:00:08] <oldlaptop> haskell as a trendy trend is new, haskell itself dates to the '80s
[19:00:12] <jkk> <|smlckz|> well I have tried libre draw and some more :)
[19:00:12] <merijn> snake: The very first Haskell implementation was built in 1989
[19:00:37] <oldlaptop> merijn: That's more or less contemporary with python, then, IIRC?
[19:00:39] <[itchyjunk]> FP is old
[19:00:41] <oldlaptop> or at least perl and tcl
[19:00:44] <|smlckz|> jkk: why are you trying to edit pdf files in the first place?
[19:00:55] <snake> i love OOP, to me it feels so much more natural than FP
[19:00:58] <merijn> Meaning it predates all of: Java, Python, Ruby, JS, and PHP
[19:01:07] <sonny> python is mid 90s iirc
[19:01:15] <oldlaptop> sonny: early '90s, apparently
[19:01:16] <snake> merijn, yeah php suffers from strange names as well
[19:01:18] <merijn> oldlaptop: Python was released in 1991 initially
[19:01:26] <oldlaptop> (I was thinking '89 or '90)
[19:01:27] <snake> like "explode" to split a string
[19:01:32] <sonny> oh, maybe I'm thinking of lua

[19:01:38] <oldlaptop> perl and tcl are both a little older

[19:02:00] <snake> pulse, heh
[19:02:07] <pulse> jkk, I would have never guessed that one
[19:02:25] <sonny> I like the offside rule myself 
[19:02:35] <merijn> snake: tbh "mconcat" is just smashing all lists together. Smashing lists together with an element in between is called "intersperse" in Haskell which is, frankly, a *much* better name than join
[19:02:57] <sonny> I thought that was zip?
[19:03:01] <snake> merijn, join is better than intersperse and mconcat
[19:03:07] <pulse> I'm waiting for the world to come full circle and everyone move away from FP back to OOP
[19:03:08] <snake> that is my opinion
[19:03:15] <merijn> pulse: It won't happen
[19:03:16] <pulse> It will happen I'm 100% sure
[19:03:27] <pulse> merijn, Oh yes it will. Fashion changes
[19:03:31] <sonny> the world has not left oop
[19:03:32] <oldlaptop> tcl, which *does* predate haskell (barely), happens to call "smash all the lists together" concat
[19:03:32] <pulse> Right now it's fashionable to hate OOP
[19:03:37] <sonny> as far as I can tell
[19:03:38] <merijn> pulse: I disagree the move towards FP is fashion
[19:03:52] <pulse> merijn, FP was popular way back in the day
[19:03:54] <snake> its definitely fashion xD, but in the nerd sense
[19:03:54] <pulse> then it wasn't
[19:03:56] <pulse> now it is again
[19:03:57] <snake> so antifashion
[19:04:05] <merijn> There are very solid, objective reasons it is better for constructing large codebases. OOP is only popular due to inertia

[19:04:18] <oldlaptop> I agree "intersperse" is a better name for the operation tcl's "join" does
[19:04:46] <GeDaMo> I think Mathematica uses 'riffle' for interleaving lists
[19:04:46] <snake> oldlaptop, intersperse does not do the same thing as join

[19:05:19] <|smlckz|> i don't care fashion, as long as the code works, is fast enough *and* maintainable enough, why should i care?
[19:05:20] <merijn> oldlaptop: There's two actually. There's "intersperse :: a -> [a] -> [a]" and "intercalate :: [a] -> [[a]] -> [a]"
[19:05:21] <snake> but to do a join in haskell you combine intersperse and concat, or use mconcat
[19:05:24] <[itchyjunk]> <pulse> I'm waiting for the world to come full circle and everyone move away from FP back to OOP
[19:05:24] <sonny> lot's of languages have added functional features in the best way they could
[19:05:28] <snake> or intercolate
[19:05:32] <[itchyjunk]> maybe the fadculture can move away from FP
[19:05:43] <[itchyjunk]> i don't think the mathy bit of CS will want to move away from FP
[19:05:49] <snake> yeah intercalate like merijn said
[19:05:51] <[itchyjunk]> things like Coq are coded in FP languages
[19:05:52] <merijn> snake: You don't need concat with intersperse, not intercalate
[19:05:52] <mrig> jkk the trick is to think of pdf as the output of a compilation, not as a workable file format. If you want a workable format, you could investigate postscript.

[19:23:14] <pikapika> i don't know much logic, but I am quite sure, logic comes before set theory in those constructions
[19:23:23] <pikapika> Other constructions place the set as the fundamental "atom"
[19:23:26] <[itchyjunk]> It doesn't use set theory.

[19:25:43] <pulse> Like, none of this matters. At all
[19:25:45] <[itchyjunk]> I am drinking tea currently.
[19:25:45] <pikapika> I didn't say anything
[19:25:48] <merijn> [itchyjunk]: It basically introduces the whole infinite hierarchy of universes with expressions :: Type_0 and Type_0 :: Type_1 etc.
[19:25:50] <pulse> Nice
[19:25:55] <pikapika> You are the one whos wanking about mathematicians and coq
[19:26:01] <[itchyjunk]> merijn, oh that seems fimiliar from Coq
[19:26:02] <sonny> yeah, I need to do prolog
[19:26:06] <[itchyjunk]> merijn, but also from haskell?

[19:26:14] <[itchyjunk]> pikapika, you were wrong about Coq == logic.
[19:26:21] <pikapika> I was already clear that yes of course some math people might use coq, but unlike what you are saying its not something most do
[19:26:21] <[itchyjunk]> Not sure what I can do to change that.
[19:26:24] <jkk> pulse, pikapika are you in UK?
[19:26:32] <[itchyjunk]> No, you said logicians use it not mathematicians.
[19:26:39] <pikapika> And in fact, the languages that most mathematicians work with are usually C++ and fortran
[19:26:42] <pyzozord> user51: haskell also seems to be a valuable one to learn and agda/coq
[19:26:44] <[itchyjunk]> But mathematicians use it without using it for logic.
[19:26:50] <pikapika> [itchyjunk], logicians are a subbranch of mathematicians, sort of
[19:26:59] <merijn> [itchyjunk]: Haskell uses System F_omega because it only supports: expressions, types, kinds (i.e. type of types) and sorts (types of kinds), but only a single sort (BOX)
[19:27:01] <jkk> <[itchyjunk]> you argue alot when proven wrong Xd
[19:27:02] <[itchyjunk]> I am taking the intersection of logicians and mathematicians.
[19:27:07] <[itchyjunk]> And claiming they use coq.
[19:27:10] <pulse> jkk, No - Slovenia
[19:27:17] <user51> GeDaMo: why those languages? just because they give new perspectives?
[19:27:19] <[itchyjunk]> Since you wanna talk about math, it should be clear who i am talking about.
[19:27:23] <GeDaMo> user51: yes
[19:27:26] <jkk> pulse, haha OOO I have met one dude from Slovenie

[19:27:30] <[itchyjunk]> merijn, oh hmm

[19:27:40] <merijn> user51: Those are certainly good suggestions for new perspectives

[19:27:53] <jkk> pulse, he was freaking alchoholic :)
[19:28:08] <user51> i had apl and j in a language list, but not prolog.
[19:28:08] <jkk> another one was doing weed :)
[19:28:17] <merijn> user51: I would also add Forth, any ML-like functional language (Haskell, Ocaml, F#), and any Lisp/Scheme to that list (if you didn't have that already
[19:28:32] <jkk> pulse, do you like programming? 
[19:28:35] <user51> but now i ahve a long language list, and i'm curious how much overlap is there
[19:28:39] <merijn> user51: J is basically an APL rip-off designed to (unlike APL) be writable with only ascii
[19:28:41] <pulse> jkk, Slovenians love three things. Fresh air, alcohol, and weed. In that order
[19:28:42] <jkk> many people seems to do it only to get paid
[19:28:43] <pikapika> You have to understand
[19:28:48] <merijn> Since APL basically required a custom keyboard
[19:28:49] <pulse> jkk, Like? I'm a professional ;)
[19:28:57] <pyzozord> user51: I think the point is that these recommendations do not have too much overlap
[19:28:59] <jkk> pulse, well do you like it?
[19:29:00] <jkk> :)
[19:29:11] <pikapika> Haskell and Coq are just the passing fads of the day
[19:29:13] <kek_> I'm trying to optimize my MPI application. I use HDF for file IO in parallel. I'm wondering: Is it worth to buffer data and write a big chunk at once over making several small file writes?
[19:29:20] <pikapika> They haven't shown much real impact
[19:29:24] <pulse> jkk, Yep
[19:29:27] <user51> one other question: are there any worthwhile lessons in implementing those languages?
[19:29:27] <[itchyjunk]> Haskell is older than a lot of popular language.

[19:30:24] <merijn> user51: Sure, I think implementing a (doesn't really matter) programming language is *super* educational
[19:30:25] <pikapika> [itchyjunk], of course, tesla is a modern hipster company

[19:30:30] <[itchyjunk]> so what?
[19:30:32] <pyzozord> user51: at the minimum write a sudoku solver complexity-level thing in each, possibly would be nice to go through one year of advent of code and and implement it in each of these languages
[19:30:34] <pikapika> so it makes sense they want to attract modern hipster programmers

[19:30:58] <pikapika> or the audio library
[19:30:59] <[itchyjunk]> It uses haskell regardless.
[19:31:05] <[itchyjunk]> sonny, lol
[19:31:08] <merijn> user51: I took (and then TAed) the compiler construction class at my old university for several years and students repeatedly told me that while it was 1 of the hardest classes it was also the most educational one

[19:31:11] <pikapika> or the network stack
[19:31:23] <merijn> pikapika: There's literally a livecoding (i.e. interactive audio/music) framework for Haskell...
[19:31:23] <[itchyjunk]> sonny, yeah idk why people think language enjoying success = everyone and their mother using thel anguage
[19:31:27] <sonny> it's a (dark) joke, but it's true
[19:31:27] <oldlaptop> merijn: The "new wave" of boring OO languages already smells of haskell
[19:31:34] <pikapika> merijn, [itchyjunk] and where it is competitive with existing apps

But note that these issues are boring, pragmatic issues that have to deal with legacy code/standard and implementation, and not theoretical problems. We *know* how to make a Haskell-like language without these issues. But doing so is a massive engineering investment so it hasn't happened yet
[19:36:55] <pikapika> Mathematical theories are nice, but a real language has to exist in the real world with finite resources and time bounds

[19:44:37] <pulse> Maybe but a youtube tutorial will never teach you even 1% of what a book can
[19:44:45] <pulse> It's a very casual approach to learning
[19:44:48] <pulse> No effort
[19:44:58] <jkk> pyzozord, second part is actually true :)
[19:45:00] <pulse> Not to mention time consuming
[19:45:06] <jkk> to a degree
[19:45:08] <kveroneau> Videos are better suited for "how-to" not for indepth learning.
[19:45:10] <pyzozord> jkk: it's not
[19:45:11] <user51> sonny: what does ocaml/rust bring to the able?
[19:45:26] <pulse> kveroneau, Yeah, for a quick overview they are typically fine
[19:45:28] <jkk> pyzozord, go to any bar in america and ask people directly when they are drunk
[19:45:31] <kveroneau> A video might get you started, but it will never be as indepth as a book, or a long documentation online.
[19:45:39] <merijn> user51: TAPL will take you *all* the way from "I barely know what lambda calculus is" to "I can read research papers on type systems" and it will do it with one single, well structured, resource. Rather than searching for many different tutorials
[19:45:39] <pyzozord> jkk: i like when a extrover adopts me sometimes and invites me out and pushes me outside of my comfort zone just a bit, it's good for me
[19:45:39] <sonny> ocaml is a functional language, rust has borrow checking
[19:45:49] <thevishy> Videos are good to get you started -- I agree!
[19:45:49] <merijn> I'd go Haskell over Ocaml, tbh
[19:46:05] <sonny> yeah, I think haskell is harder to start with
[19:46:05] <pyzozord> jkk: yeah people sitting alone in bars is not a representative sample
[19:46:08] <merijn> Ocaml/F# are like the pepsi of ML-like FP

[19:46:43] <merijn> sonny: We used to use Ocaml for the FP courses, but students will manage insane effort to not learn
[19:46:49] <oldlaptop> user51: I don't know where in the world you are. In the US it shouldn't honestly be that hard for a very large majority of people to save up and buy a few good academic books, and Amazon will generally deliver them in a few days for peanuts. Other places could be (very) different.
[19:46:56] <merijn> sonny: Ask them to implement "map", get 40 lines of mutable reference use
[19:46:56] <sonny> plus in Ocaml/F# you are fine to do C like programming and it won't get in your way
[19:47:00] <jkk> pyzozord, who said alone :) ask a bunch of guys who came to drink together as well

So it is expected that if you run a program that it's execution time might vary depending on how busy the whole node is (you might only use 4/32 cores or whatever). From my experience, it'd vary at about 10 20% but currently it seems to vary for 50%. Can that really be? I have a lot of file IO (non parallel file system). Could it be that

[22:18:34] <pulse> A _mathematical_ model can be made 100% accurate, because it's purely conceptual
[22:18:34] <[itchyjunk]> i said b) as well.
[22:18:37] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: I think you took an earlier discussion about NM/QFT and tried to make some point about models in-general that was confusing
[22:18:45] <bjs> and was misconstrued as a point about QFT.
[22:18:47] <pulse> A _physical_ model cannot, under any circumstances. Because the world we live in is fuzzy and noisy
[22:18:48] <[itchyjunk]> Again, nothing to do with model being mathematical or not.
[22:18:55] <[itchyjunk]> bjs, no.
[22:19:03] <[itchyjunk]> I calimed newtonian model was wrong.
[22:19:11] <[itchyjunk]> the counter claim was all models are inherently wrong.
[22:19:16] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: I'm not sure why you're arguing so hard against mathematical models, they are a demonstration of your point.  Here we have some models, that can describe things "100% accurately"
[22:19:17] <[itchyjunk]> You just refused to follow along 
[22:19:30] <[itchyjunk]> They are a demonstration of my point.
[22:19:32] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: I'm not sure why you're so dismissive of me?
[22:19:33] <[itchyjunk]> But i don't need them.
[22:19:35] <bjs> It's very rude?
[22:19:37] <pulse> Physical ones are. Not wrong per se, but inaccurate to varying degrees
[22:19:43] <[itchyjunk]> Because i never made a claim about mathematical model.
[22:19:43] <pikapika> You are the one who introduced some vacuous abstract definition of a model that had no bearing to what was being discussed or anything of value at all
[22:19:46] <pyzozord> [itchyjunk]: you took the claim in a different way than it was intended and started picking apart the words. That's counterproductive, unless we are in a rigorous scientific environment everyone knows there is s certain amount of imprecisenes in the language
[22:19:46] <pikapika> Don't lie
[22:19:55] <[itchyjunk]> bjs, because you're skipping over the part where someone claimed all models are inherently wrong.
[22:20:00] <[itchyjunk]> Which is what i was countering.
[22:20:10] <[itchyjunk]> But you keep trying to drag QFT in it.
[22:20:11] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: Again I'm not sure why you're so hung up on this. You claim that "some models can predict things 100% accurately"  and people bring up mathematical models here
[22:20:24] <pulse> I think we're piling on [itchyjunk] who seems to be having a bad day :) Let's just drop this and hug eachother, and sing around a fire

[22:23:58] <isekaijin> [itchyjunk]: For most engineering students, the actual reason to study some modern physics is not that they will deal with relativistic or quantum scales everyday, but rather than it is useful for understanding the behavior of matter at normal human scale.

[22:26:22] <pyzozord> I should ask less controversial questions next time, like politics. Seems like physics is a bit too much :D
[22:26:22] <[itchyjunk]> isekaijin, so modern physics better explains everyday thing?
