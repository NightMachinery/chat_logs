[16:21:38] <FightingFalcon> Whats theh purpose of this css rule?
[16:21:43] <FightingFalcon> there is "." in content?
[16:24:00] <DPA> :before, ::after pseudo elements aren't displayed unless the content property is set.
[16:24:21] <FightingFalcon> and what does this rule do?
[16:27:21] <DPA> display: block; causes a line break, the rest is to make the element invisible & sizeless. So the first node of all the things listed there is intended to start on a new line.
[16:27:43] <DPA> *pseudo element
[16:30:24] <DPA> Consider this: https://jsfiddle.net/zs0g2nxb/ Make the left pane smaller until the text wraps around.

[16:34:42] <DPA> I like white on black the most. But I think anything with enough contrast is fine. It's a matter of taste.
[16:38:43] <FightingFalcon> https://www.abnehmenclub.de/
[16:38:56] <FightingFalcon> How does this design look like? logo and the hamburger?
[16:47:19] <DPA> I'm not much of a designer myself, I'm mostly a developer. When the hamburger is clicked, the cross has very low contrast. And the search field looks a bit out of place. The tables look nice with the smaller font,
[16:47:19] <DPA> but may be harder to read for some. The color theme could maybe be a bit more consistent in some places, it seams there are no 2 different things with the same color, although that in itself is self consistent in a way too.
[16:47:19] <DPA> Overall, I think it's pretty good.
[16:49:19] <FightingFalcon> thanks
