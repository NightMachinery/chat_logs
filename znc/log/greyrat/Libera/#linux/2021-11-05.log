[00:00:36] <Kingsy> my internet connection can handle 25MB/s
[00:00:38] <bparker> then something is very very wrong
[00:00:39] <blackgatonegro> Kingsy that's normal with torrents not client specific.  You can set a limit on download and upload speed in some clients if you want.
[00:00:44] <Kingsy> bparker: yup

[00:26:53] <Guest9525> Yes. Girls dislike dating programmers. I live in Silicon Valley and I learned the hard way - by dating a bunch of programmers. Here's why women dislike dating programmers :
[00:26:54] <Guest9525> A REAL Progammer - a programmer that LOVES to code - is addicted to programming on his computer.
[00:26:54] <Guest9525> Because of #1 above, Programmers are on their computers for hours on end and dont really care much about anything else. It is hard for them to pull away to do "normal things"

[00:26:55] <Guest9525> Because of #1 and #2 above, Programmers don't bother to shower or follow basic hygeine protocol before going on a date. They lierally smell like “a$$” and they have that “homeless” stench when you get near them. Very gross. Very unattractive.
[00:26:55] <Guest9525> Because of #1 and #2 above, Programmers do not brush their teeth often and their breath stink like $h**. And they certainly don't floss or use mouth wash. All of this is absolutely gross. The thought of kissing a smelly, dirty mouth is repulsive.
[00:26:56] <Guest9525> Because of #1, #2 and #4, eventually Programmers end up with teeth problems and have ugly, gross teeth when they are older. Their mouths are not visually attractive to kiss.
[00:26:56] <Guest9525> Because of #1 and #2 above, they don't wash their clothes often. This is not attractive. Eventually the girlfriend is forced to wash his clothes for him - just so she can tolerate being around him.

[01:08:26] <ivan_wagner> hey, (no this is not a casual bot spam, this is a miserable human asking for help) I have come to a problem with java application running under Eclipse (as well as Intellij) on Cinnamon. The built app shows nothing but a small glitch of window, when I turned the hidpi display scaling off the app was shown fine (except it lacked proper scaling of its elements). Here is a link to a short video recording presenting mentioned problem:

[01:15:45] <ivan_wagner> akk, this doesn't seem to be a specific DE problem nor invisible window related. As I said (and is shown in the video) the program compiles, new window pops on the screen but it's a glitch (?). Yet again that's the cause that happens when display scale is set to 200%. On defaults the app works as expected (ofc except the scaling)

[04:05:03] <phogg> cottnn: SSDs being what they are you would think that would now change
[04:05:15] <stoned> They advertise in MB and get away with selling less for more money.
[04:05:22] <cottnn> and my 500GB ssd is 500107862016 bytes
[04:05:34] <stoned> If they marketed the same capacity in GiB, they'd have to market disks with a lower capacity sticker
[04:05:40] <stoned> and they don't like that.
[04:05:50] <cottnn> GiB for storage space doesn't really make sense

[04:07:45] <cottnn> MiB/etc shouldn't be used in relation to storage
[04:08:07] <stoned> You actually get 953GB of actual usable space. Not 1000
[04:08:14] <stoned> That's the tricky marketing.
[04:08:19] <phogg> They should be required by regulators to list the binary capacity, even if it's alongside the decimal one (and in finer print).
[04:08:31] <stoned> GiB is the usable space. Not the GB
[04:08:38] *** Quits: d4d0 (sid524846@user/d4d0) ()
[04:08:41] <phogg> They're both the usable space
[04:08:43] <Common-Lisp> They should list the trinary capacity too
[04:08:53] <cottnn> stoned: what phogg said
[04:08:54] <phogg> Common-Lisp: let's not go complicating things
[04:08:54] <stoned> GB is marketing. It will always be less usable capacity than the MB advertisement
[04:09:02] <stoned> the usable space.
[04:09:16] <phogg> stoned: no, the size in GB given is usually *lower* than actual capacity.
[04:09:18] *** Quits: Nimzowitsch (~nimzo@user/nimzowitsch) (Remote host closed the connection)
[04:09:27] <stoned> Sure. 1000MB is 953Gib is 1000MB is 953GiB. ==
[04:09:36] <cottnn> MiB only should be used for RAM and stuff
[04:09:48] <phogg> e.g. your 2000398934016 "2TB" drive is 2.0003989 TB in reality.
[04:09:49] <cottnn> because RAM is actually powers-of-2
[04:09:59] <stoned> Sure
[04:10:07] <stoned> But it's not 2.0003989 TiB
[04:10:22] <phogg> for marketing reasons you should always expect the real capacity to be >= the advertised capacity (in decimal)
[04:10:39] <stoned> 2TB = 1862 GiB
[04:10:54] <stoned> You don't actually get 2TB of usable space. You get 1.8TiB of usable space.
[04:10:55] <phogg> stoned: which is why they should be required to list the capacity in SI binary notation
[04:10:59] <stoned> That's marketing man.
[04:11:09] <phogg> you do get 2TB of space, just not 2TiB
[04:11:09] <stoned> You can market a bigger number by multiplying it with the wind!
[04:11:20] <stoned> Exactly what I said :D
[04:11:33] <sam76> So just made sure Linux is properly shut down too so 131072 leaves resize/move greyed however if I click in free space proceeding it suggests the following
[04:11:36] <cottnn> as i've said, GiB/MiB/TiB don't really make sense when used as storage space

[05:18:14] <phinxy> Blondie101010, that works fine.  I's ondemand, there is a /sys control file for undervoltaging the cpu which is what I'm doing currently.  Finding lowest stable voltage.  The "beta" version of the cpufreq driver supports changing the actual pstate frequency, i.e. overclocking, but it's raw editing of the pstate..

[11:56:23] <cottnn> kuhilas: if you are concerned about such things like the operator being able to mess with your server, your only way is to rent a dedicated server
[11:56:31] <cottnn> or a bare-metal server
[11:56:41] <cottnn> (so basically with no virtualization)

[11:58:09] <cottnn> yeah, the server's owner can either set up a DMA thing or use some Intel ME/Some AMD thing to take control
[11:58:10] <kuhilas> I have a web server running on a vps and I have created a user to it and disabled root login and forgot the password. It's a nat vps with "no support". On admin panel I can change root password but it doesn't really help here :p So I guess I e-mail the vps provider how much I have to pay if they could reset my user accounts password there... so, I can then write that password down next time :D

[11:59:52] <DPA> A backup is the thing that can't be restored when it's needed.
[12:00:24] <cottnn> kuhilas: If you don't know the root password then I guess they could change the password by editing /etc/shadow on a qcow image of your VM
[12:00:49] <cottnn> or change grub config to boot into a shell directly and change it from there
[12:01:03] <cottnn> but no idea if that would be free
[12:01:06] <kuhilas> I can change the root pw on admin panel web interface, but it doesn't work when I try login with it, and that's maybe because I have disabled root login

[12:01:36] <RayTracer> kuhilas: maybe the vps vendor has a rescue boot and you can fix your install with it

[12:01:41] <kuhilas> the web interface also has a "console" but it says "node not found". Not sure what that console is about
[12:02:21] <kuhilas> yeah so they could edit sshd_config to enable root login again, or they could change password for my user if I give them username right?

[16:55:02] <Psi-Jack> yeah, client-side caching is only done in RAM, so a reboot would clear up any issues, normally. If it's not, there's something going wrong on the server side.
[16:55:18] <hexnewbie> ls hangs on large directories due to colouring because the colouring/indicator requires it to call stat() on every file if d_type in readdir() is not available (e.g. if filesystem is NFS, XFS)
[16:55:42] <irgendwer4711> that folder has 5 other folders only

[18:30:41] <BinarySavior> preface: i do not generally trust scripts i find online, and most certainly do not run any old script with sudo.  however, i'm trying to set up openvpn server, and found this script to help: https://github.com/Nyr/openvpn-install/blob/master/openvpn-install.sh  I have a question about line 259 (dh parameters).  Shouldn't the dh parameters be generated uniquely for each instance of openvpn server?  or is it safe to use this one as it is

[19:13:11] <ayecee> in what way?
[19:13:12] <rdrg109> [Q] What are the differences of using "%z" and "%Z" for the timezone in "date"? I'm currently using "date" for storing timestamps in my database, and "%Z" seem perfect because for my timezone, it outputs "-05" while "%z", for my timezone, outputs "-0500". However, I"m wondering what are the downsides of using %Z over %z that I might be putting aside. Any help is appreciated.

[22:43:07] <gneeriiloeepdeer> hi, im using pdftk to aes128 encrypt a pdf file I tried pdftk estrangement.pdf output 1.128.pdf user_pw alice. but I get Warning: Using a password on the command line interface can be insecure. Use the keyword PROMPT to supply a password via standard input instead. Except that I don't know how to do that> I have written <PROMPT> at the end of the command, but it is identified as an unexpected token. So, how do I do this right?
[22:43:07] <iomari891> right now th clone has all the partitions and files in place. I've used boot-repair numerous times in case the grub bootloader got mess up. But still no boot.

[23:29:32] <msiism> You could report those KDE bugs…
[23:29:38] <msiism> Someone might fix them.
[23:29:58] <XJ8> That's not the point msiism, there's too many new bugs for every squashed one.
