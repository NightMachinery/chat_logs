[06:39:05] <SpaceVimBot_> <semayog> what lang do you use? (re @SpaceVimBot: Reficulx: Thank you very much for the reply! I save the file and it gives me some compiling errors saying that some classes are not recognized. I checked those classes and found that they are the classes under the same package. Do you have a solution to this?)
