[02:38:10] <somiaj> Elw3: the driver should be apart of the kernel, sounds like it might be firmware? On the machine it works, what firmwre did you install for it?
[02:38:37] *** Joins: ax56234 (~NickServ@user/ax562)
[02:39:08] <PMT> Elw3: if you tell us what the hardware is, we can probably suggest things. if you plug it into your desktop and lsusb -t, it'll tell you what driver it's using
[02:39:09] <Elw3> The modem works as stock on any desktop system.
[02:39:45] <PMT> dmesg on the ARM system might also contain logs of the driver trying to load and going "oops my pants are on my head"
[02:40:03] <somiaj> what chipset is it? If it works on a stock kernel in x86 hardware, but not in arm hardare, is this device compadable with arm hardware?
[02:40:29] <Elw3> The driver as per network manager is called option. no idea what lsusb gives here.
[02:40:40] *** Parts: polardroid (~polardroi@85.203.45.79) ()
[02:41:10] <somiaj> on the machine that is running, lshw should tell you what module it is using, that can help narrow things down
[02:41:21] <PMT> Elw3: well, it'll probably say option too, since that does appear to be a USB GSM modem driver.
[02:41:29] <PMT> So what does dmesg on the ARM system say when you plug it in?
[02:42:24] <Elw3> The same as the desktop. Its detected as modem and works according to it, network manager however cannot see it.
[02:42:48] <Elw3> I am likely just missing _option_, so where do i get it?
[02:44:48] <somiaj> could it be an additional network manager package needs to be installed for this?
[02:44:51] <PMT> Elw3: my ARM64 kernel has the option module. If dmesg shows it loading, please pastebin the last 50 or so lines from dmesg. If it doesn't, try modprobe option.
[02:44:58] <somiaj> check which networkmanager packages are installed
[02:45:17] <somiaj> and yes, share the actual output with us, just so we better see what is going on
[02:45:52] <PMT> I don't see any nm packages that would be relevant here, though I could be wrong.
[02:46:14] <Elw3> I cant, cant get the maschine connected after all.
[02:46:57] <Elw3> Or rather, i am using the motdem right now, so ill have to leave to try :D
[02:48:15] <PMT> If you have a USB flash drive, you could copy the log onto it.

[03:21:50] <Elw3> :D Anyway this is a custom kernel, can i create this module somehow? With say source installs or so?
[03:23:19] <sney> you would need to enable it in the config for your custom kernel, and then run the build process again, for at least the modules
[03:24:23] <sney> linux kernel modules are not typically something that are built separately when they're in mainline source, but *maybe* you could finagle module-assistant or dkms into doing it too. read the docs to find out.
[03:24:52] <sney> !kernel handbook
[03:24:52] <dpkg> The Debian Linux Kernel Handbook http://kernel-handbook.debian.net/ - packaged as debian-kernel-handbook since Debian 7 "Wheezy" - serves as a single access point to all kernel-related documentation.  See chapter 4.2 to rebuild official Debian kernel packages, see chapter 4.5 to build a custom kernel from Debian kernel source.
[03:24:56] <sney> a lot of general info here.
[03:25:48] <somiaj> Elw3: one thing for future issues with yoru custom kernel, is keep a debian stock one around, this way you can quickly see if it is your issue or debian's
[03:26:01] <Elw3> I did not make this kernel myself tho, just this device comes with it and is needed.
[03:26:44] <sney> if your device vendor provides the source, then you can follow the same instructions as with a stock debian kernel
[03:26:46] <Elw3> I was hoping adding a kernel module is as easy as enabling the source repo and install it. guess not then.
[03:27:06] <sney> otherwise you will have to ask the vendor to enable this in the kernel config
[03:27:17] <somiaj> Are you also then running some based on debian os with this custom kernel and various other customizations for this armd device? What arm device by the way?
[03:27:40] <somiaj> You bsically have to rebuild the kernel, so hopefully they provdie the source and thier configuration

[03:34:53] <sney> for the .ko file to be compatible, it would have to *at least* be from a binary kernel tree of the same architecture and a close version. you certainly can't copy it from your x86 desktop and have it work
[03:35:27] <sney> different varieties of arm running the same OS will sometimes be close enough, sure
[03:36:20] <Elw3> So is there a source where i can browse these files online?
[03:36:41] <sney> nobody is building binary modules for arbitrary kernels for you to download online, no.

[03:38:58] <Elw3> I meant to browse the files that are supposed to come with the stock kernel...
[03:39:29] <sney> Elw3: your quickest option would be to contact the vendor, and tell them to rebuild their kernel with CONFIG_USB_SERIAL_OPTION=m, and then give you somewhere to download that new kernel or just the module, etc
[03:40:12] <sney> if they won't reply or are MIA, then maybe try it with a debian kernel package from packages.debian.org or snapshot.debian.org with the closest possible version number, but there is literally no guarantee that this will work

[03:44:09] <sney> you don't fine a .ko file for download separately. you download a kernel package with the closest possible version to your kernel. then you unpack it and find the file inside the package.

[04:00:06] <PMT> do you have other devices that can connect to the wpa2 AP successfully now?
[04:01:15] <PMT> I'd probably install firmware-iwlwifi from buster-backports, reboot into Linux again, see if it works, if not install linux-image-amd64 from buster-backports, reboot into new kernel in Linux, try again, if not, I'd probably cut a custom backport of wpa_supplicant but you could "just" upgrade to bullseye instead of wrestling with that
[04:01:37] <sney> Elw3: lol, 5.10 is nowhere near close enough, that will not work, there were huge changes in 5.9 for starters. you would need a 5.6, which you will be able to find on snapshot.debian.org. sid/testing had them in 2020.

[06:18:06] <Blondie101010> that's assuming that all programs that write need to receive a request

[08:08:09] <somiaj> shugo: usually one consideres ubuntu to have more recent packages because of their much faster release cycle.
[08:08:17] <shugo> like for example i think the version of firefox
[08:08:19] <sney> ubuntu and debian are on different release cycles. debian just had a stable release last month. what software do you need that's newer?
[08:08:26] <rk4> the fun thing about, say, only hanging on disk IO 5% of the time, is that if I'm there for that 5% i'll be annoyed :)
[08:08:33] <somiaj> shugo: but this sounds like an XY problem, as outside of sns syndrom, there is very matrue software that is 'old'
[08:08:58] <shugo> also can i install latest software without compilling in debian ?
[08:08:59] <somiaj> shugo: debian only ships with firefox-esr, which isn't the newest version that updates every few months
[08:09:04] <sney> firefox isn't in debian. debian ships firefox-esr, which is at the same version as firefox-esr from mozilla.org. if you want bleeding-edge firefox, you can install the snap/flatpak or the tarball from firefox
[08:09:08] <somiaj> !don't break debian
[08:09:08] <dpkg> i guess dont break debian is https://wiki.debian.org/DontBreakDebian
[08:09:34] <somiaj> shugo: there are ways to go about it, but you may want to decide why you need the newest software, it can come with more bugs
[08:09:42] <sney> browsers are tricky but you *can* get them at current upstream versions without compiling, and usually without breaking much since they're so self-contained
[08:10:14] <sney> the biggest problem you sometimes get is like, link integration from one app to another
[08:10:31] <somiaj> if you want chromium, just go with google-chrome, they make packages which are compadable, google-chrome-unstable gets so many updates
[08:11:01] <somiaj> but chromium is fairly up to date in debian, it just updates more based on security issues than when the new release hits
[08:11:15] <rk4> the suggestion of a lot of RAM infront of a HDD is an advocacy for a multi-tiered storage subsystem, now with m2 SSDs offering some pretty extrodinary performance over HDDs, naturally one wonders...perhaps there's a scheme with RAM-SSD-HDD
[08:11:53] <sney> I had a zfs-backed office file server that had major benefits from a big L2ARC on ssd... in 2017, with small business ram constraints.
[08:12:30] <sney> current wisdom says L2ARC is pretty much obsoleted by having plenty of faster ram. but ymmv depending on environment and use case
[08:12:40] *** Joins: tejr (~tejr@user/tejr)
[08:12:44] <shugo> okay so which distro is the most polished with debian ?
[08:13:05] <sney> shugo: debian is a distro. ubuntu is a distro. there is no 'with debian'
[08:13:16] <sney> look on distrowatch if you want a popularity chart
[08:13:26] <shugo> sry i meant DE
[08:13:39] <shugo> s/distro/DE
[08:13:43] <somiaj> to me, newest software vs most polished are different, debian is fairly polished because it undergoes lots of testing, which as a side effect means older software
[08:14:00] <sney> gnome is shipped as the default, xfce and plasma are also solid, and it's typically downhill from there. depends on what you need.
[08:14:08] <somiaj> all the DEs should be well tested in debian, choose the one that suits your work flow
[08:14:32] <shugo> i have 4gb ram so i need a light DE but it should have the basic features
[08:14:47] <sney> do you have a gpu that supports hardware rendering?
[08:14:58] <sney> even an igpu, like anything from intel in the past 10 years?
[08:15:07] <shugo> its inbuilt amd gpu
[08:15:13] <shugo> i am on a laptop
[08:15:50] <sney> then you don't need to worry about ram with the DE, because all of the heavy lifting is done by your gpu. your browser will use way more ram than your DE ever could
[08:16:05] <somiaj> 4gigs should be fine for a DE, the browser on the other hand
[08:16:05] <shugo> amd readega vega 8 mobile graphics
[08:16:16] <shugo> s/readga/radeon
[08:16:44] <sney> yup, that's supported (with firmware) - a fast disk will also help, any ssd from the past decade really

[08:21:41] <shugo> or the windows feel in general
[08:21:45] <sney> just make sure you use the firmware installer, since the regular one won't support your gpu, or probably your wifi. https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/unofficial/non-free/cd-including-firmware/11.0.0+nonfree/amd64/iso-cd/
[08:22:03] <shugo> yeah i was about to ask this thanks
[08:22:38] <sney> I'm pretty sure there are themes for that, of course if you like cinnamon you are free to use cinnamon. in debian it'll be the same as any other system that ships with cinnamon 4.8.6
[08:23:04] <shugo> but i doubt cinnamon will run smoothly
[08:25:45] <sney> anyway, yes xfce supports having the panel/taskbar stuff on the bottom with the menu on the left and the tray on the right. I'm sure it's just in the menus.

[13:32:38] <jpic> hi all, i'm investigating a server which seems to sometimes change its FQDN to "hostname.unassigned-domain" instead of its right FQDN. I have found in /var/log/installer/cdebconf/questions.dat that Name: netcfg/get_domain got Value: unassigned-domain, instead of the right value they have on their other servers, so that seems to be the mistake. However, I know completely fail to find where netcfg/get_domain
[13:32:44] <jpic> is used, debconf-get-selections does not show this key unless --installer is passed which makes it look into /var/log/installer/cdebconf.
[13:33:00] <jpic> Do you have any idea what leftover could still be on the system based on that?
[13:33:59] <jpic> would the installer selections ever be used again ? ie. when configuring a package?
[13:34:47] <ansgar> jpic: Supplied via DHCP or such maybe?

[13:36:20] <jpic> ansgar: this doesn't seem to be happening and is supposed to have been already investigated a few times, I don't have access to the DHCP server at this point anyway. But the other servers which had the right domain in netcfg/get_domain in their own /var/log/installer/cdebconf/questions.dat are not affected by this problem
[13:38:05] <Khepra> jpic: cloud init? avahi running?
[13:40:06] <jpic> I don't think cloud-init is present on this server because it's a baremetal openstack compute host, grepping cloud-init in /var/log and /etc didn't show anything besides inside a comment in /etc/nova/nova.conf.dpkg-dist
[13:40:53] *** Quits: useretail (~useretail@185.132.19.151) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[13:41:01] <jpic> avahi does not seem to be running (currently the FQDN is back to normal on the server), but might have run I guess, so I'll keep looking into that, any other suggestion welcome of course thank you for your support!
[13:41:02] <Khepra> ehh openstack, that's your culprit
[13:41:13] <Khepra> that nova is the openstack client, like the cloud init thingy
[13:42:08] <jpic> in this case it's actually a nova server, which is the python service that deals with libvirt, it does update its FQDN from the host *into* the openstack database, which causes a mess in the database of course
[13:42:23] <jpic> so I'm currently trying to find what would be the cause for the server changing FQDN sometimes
[13:42:41] <jpic> back to this default value of debconf, which apparently they forgot to set properly

[13:45:00] <Khepra> nothing in default debian (As distributed by the ISOs), afaik, except dhclient as and if invoked by ifupdown. systemd-networkd is not default, but it also has intrinsict DHCP client capabilities. systemd-resolved coupled with mDNS might also but that's atypical. the rest is a set of infinite possibilities of gods know what awful things openstacks and other ghastly things bring into the equation.
[13:45:39] <jpic> yeah, i just figured it's actually a ubuntu host ... sorry about that
[13:46:45] <jpic> nowadays openstack is deployed in containers with kolla-ansible though so it doesn't touch the host as much as it does... just saying, in case you want to give it another try xD
[13:46:56] <jpic> thanks for the suggestions Khepra, really appreciated
[13:48:02] <Khepra> ubuntu would suggest systemd-resolved and mDNS thingy, as that's defaulf

[19:14:16] <somiaj> you need to add an 'allow-hotplug enp3s0' to make it run if you plug/unplug it, that also makes it run at boot
[19:14:49] <Kingsy> ah ok. do I need a netmask line?
[19:15:02] <Kingsy> or is what I have enough it just hasnt worked because of the missing hotplug line?
[19:16:05] <somiaj> I think it will just use a default netmask if you don't add it, you can also add a \x to the ip address if you need to modify the network/netmask
[19:16:11] <somiaj> arg /x
[19:16:38] <somiaj> Kingsy: define doens't work, 'what happens if you run 'ifup enp3s0' -- does it work?
[19:16:43] <Kingsy> so without a hotplug line it wouldnt work if I just do a sudo systemctl restart networking.service ?
[19:16:51] <somiaj> if so, the only issue is you want it to run at boot, so you need to add the allow-hotplug action
[19:16:53] <Kingsy> I cant get into the box, its headless and it isnt connected to the network
[19:17:33] <Kingsy> I changed my /etc/network/interfaces file with what I pasted then I ran sudo systemctl restart networking.service and now its offline. happy to plugin a HDMI to fix. just wanted to make sure its the lack of that hotplug line.
[19:17:44] <somiaj> yea, restarting the networking.service won't do much, it is more a run one time service, but to bring it up at boot either 'allow-hotplug interface' or 'auto interface', usually people prefer the first because then it trigers whenever you plug/unplug the cable, vs just at boot
