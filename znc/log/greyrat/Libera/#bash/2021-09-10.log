[00:26:54] <thebombzen> Is there a better way to get the cpu count than /proc/cpuinfo and then finding the last "processor :"
[00:27:17] <greycat> it's an OS question, but there's grep -c
[00:27:21] <lilalinux> I have a file with lines as key/value and need to replace the keys in another file by the corresponding values
[00:27:52] <greycat> lilalinux: https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashProgramming/04
[00:28:22] <lilalinux> thank you
[00:30:08] <thebombzen> Yea, I was wondering if there was a better way than something like: grep -Ec '^processor\s+:\s+[0-9]+$' </proc/cpuinfo
[00:30:20] <thebombzen> perhaps one that works with posix
[00:30:29] <greycat> !\s
[00:30:29] <greybot> \s and \d are PCRE features. They will not work in ERE (which is what awk, egrep, and bash's =~ all use). The ERE equivalent of \s is [[:space:]], and of \d is [[:digit:]].
[00:30:48] <thebombzen> they don't?
[00:30:58] <thebombzen> I know \d doesn't work, but if I run the above command it does work
[00:31:08] <greycat> GNU grep may have it as an extension, but it's really overkill for this
[00:31:21] <thebombzen> makes sense
[00:31:29] <greycat> grep -c ^processor /proc/cpuinfo
[00:32:25] *** Joins: mer (~mer@190.92.33.204)
[00:32:34] <thebombzen> true. that being said, is /proc/cpuinfo Linux or is it posix, and if it's not posix, is there a posix way to do that?

[00:37:12] <ormaaj2> procfs = solaris
[00:38:00] <thebombzen> I ask cause there's some things that are guaranteed by posix by not to the shell
[00:38:02] <greycat> I think solaris's /proc only has PIDs
[00:38:52] <thebombzen> I learned the other day that mktemp is not posix, and mkstemp has no equivalent on the CLI
[00:39:05] <thebombzen> but you can fake it by calling mkstemp from m4 and it's strictly posixly compliant
[00:41:18] <ormaaj2> yeah certainly at least the format of cpuinfo is highly linux-specific, and probably all of that info is duplicated from elsewhere.

[00:42:50] <thebombzen> I suppose I don't really have to care, it's just kind of lame that there's no portable C standard way of doing something fairly mundane
[00:43:14] <thebombzen> that can then be turned into shell by using m4-like hacks
[00:43:32] <thebombzen> since POSIX exposes a portable threading library (pthreads) you'd think it wouldn't be too hard to ask it how many threads to spawn
[00:44:00] <greycat> you're well outside the scope of #bash there

[00:57:35] <greycat> this idea that a piece of software should be able to guess how much hardware to use all on its own is fairly new and not really sensible on a system that does more than one thing
[00:57:46] <pj> if you're just using it for setting the number of processes to start for your script then you can do something like this: nproc=$(getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN); : "${nproc:=2}"
[00:57:55] <earnestly> greycat: Many of the new build tools tend to do that, same for compressors
[00:58:07] <greycat> Many build tools do MANY horrible things.
[00:58:24] <ede> it's pretty comfortable to not be forced to write the full filename all the time, but what if the name contains special characters like "&"?
[00:58:38] <earnestly> greycat: I do think -j without a number could do such a thing
[00:58:40] <greycat> I guess if they are assumed they'll always be used on a dedicated build system that has NO other purpose, and that the user is a moron, then it kinda makes sense.

[04:20:28] <GoodCrossing> Hi all, I have a question, I'm trying to compare two lines of a text file containing 1s and 0s (it's not a binary file, these are ASCII 1s and 0s), so that if the nth character of both lines matches (i.e is 1 or 0 on both), the nth line of the result is 1, otherwise, 0. So if I have 1010 and 1101, the output should be 1000. Is there an easy way to
[04:20:29] <GoodCrossing> do this with a oneliner or something or would I need to script this properly?

[04:21:57] *** Joins: Seirdy (~Seirdy@sourcehut/user/seirdy)
[04:22:27] <neshpion> so basically you want an ASCII XNOR between line 1 and line 2?
[04:22:34] <GoodCrossing> Yep
[04:22:56] <GoodCrossing> Or really every pair of lines but I guess as long as I can do 2 lines I can do all of them
[04:26:25] <GoodCrossing> I do have two files with the data separated, along with one file with it combined, just in case it's easier to have them separated (so the nth line in one file should be compared with the nth line in the other, as opposed to the nth line being compared with the next line)

[04:30:42] <greycat> The C-programmer way would be to convert each octet of ASCII characters into a single unsigned byte value, XOR the two together, then convert the result back to ASCII.
[04:31:16] <greycat> A scripting-language approach would be to iterate over the characters of the line pairs, and compare each character one by one, assigning a new character to the output line.
[04:31:53] <greycat> Hell, that might even win out over the converting back and forth, who knows without timing the two.
[04:32:33] <GoodCrossing> Yeah, I'm going with the second one for now
[04:32:54] <GoodCrossing> This is just a one time thing for myself so just concerned on how quickly I can finish
[04:33:22] <greycat> The only question at this point is what you do if the lines are not of equal length.
[04:33:54] <GoodCrossing> Basically I've got the results of a RAM test from an Amiga 2000 and I want to compare which bits are correct and which aren't, the lines are all equal length as each value is 32 bits
[04:34:22] <greycat> So if any given input line isn't 32 characters, you can just throw an error.  That works.
[04:34:31] <akoana> # printf %s\\n "1010" > file1; printf %s\\n "1101" > file2; a="$(<file1)"; b="$(<file2)"; result=; for ((i=0; i < ${#a}; i++));do ((r=${a:$i:1} * ${b:$i:1})); result+="$r"; done; printf %s\\n "$result"
[04:34:32] <shbot> akoana: 1000
[04:34:59] <greycat> akoana: * is not correct
[04:37:24] <greycat> Also, you can use ${a:i:1} without $i because the two numeric values in ${var:i:j} are done in a math context.
[04:38:10] <akoana> ok, but "So if I have 1010 and 1101, the output should be 1000" what am I missing?
[04:38:30] <greycat> It wasn't a comprehensive example.  1000 and 1000 should give 1111.
[04:39:06] <akoana> oh, I see...
[04:41:37] <greycat> # a=10101010 b=10111000 n=${#a} out=; for ((i=0; i<n; i++)); do out+=$(( ${a:i:1} ^ ${b:i:1} )); done; echo "$out"

[15:24:17] <Soliton> the function asks in a loop if you don't give a recognised answer.
[15:25:18] <emanuele6> Soliton: yes, but i would think $ans would gets set to nothing and that `read' would fail because it reached EOF
[15:25:39] <Aryan> and the this? http://ix.io/3yrP
[15:25:40] <emanuele6> instead the read succeeds and $ans gets set to $'\004' (^D)
[15:25:50] <Aryan> or you guys do it a different way?
[15:25:59] <emanuele6> that is not the same behaviour as `read' without -n

[15:26:39] <Soliton> neither will match [yY] or [nN].

[16:34:14] <Soliton> if you pipe curl to your shell then unsurprisingly curl output is stdin.

[21:01:36] <wstrnr> imho, you should not try to shave letters off such code by using magic spells with faulty handling of input.  just write in multiple lines a simple loop that is going to construct an array

[21:03:37] <wstrnr> in unix newlines can appear in filenames, and users of graphical desktop environments often put newlines in filenames even of the directories, even of the directories with executable files in them, in order to affect how directory labels are displayed under icons on desktop

[21:04:08] <jmcantrell> I think I may have gotten myself into an XY corner.
