[00:36:05] <blackbird_0> Hi, please guys
[00:36:43] <blackbird_0> I'm trying to access to an element of a list by its index
[00:36:49] <blackbird_0> like this: https://dpaste.org/99pV
[00:38:00] <blackbird_0> Is there a way to put the variable index as index: updating_lists_forms.index?
[00:38:04] <blackbird_0> thanks
[00:40:29] <FunkyBob> in a template?  nothing built in
[00:41:07] <FunkyBob> you _could_ write a filter to do it... but you'd likely find rethinking your approach will end up cleaner

[00:58:07] <blackbird_0> ... to open updating_lists_forms.0 or updating_lists_forms.1, in general updating_lists_forms.i (where 0 <= i < size of updating_lists_forms)
[00:59:08] <FunkyBob> by the time your JS is opening the modal, it's too late... django's well and truely finished its rendering
[00:59:29] <FunkyBob> the JS is client side, Django is purely server side...
[01:00:31] <FunkyBob> so instead, have your template render _both_ forms, in separate model constructs, and have the JS select which to show

[01:30:29] <FunkyBob> that's not a problem... factor out that part of the template, and use an {% include %}
[01:31:11] <GinFuyou> or render the form asynchrounously on-demand. I'd have a fallback though
[01:31:58] <FunkyBob> (also... drip feeding requirements like that is quite infuriating... "Solve problem X" "Ok, ehre's a solution" "OK, but it must also do Y" "...")

[01:35:33] <blackbird_0> How to use the {% include %} to show form on-demand?
[01:35:54] <GinFuyou> you mixed two unrelated suggestion here
[01:36:01] <FunkyBob> since you can pass arguments to an include, you can effectively create a template macro
[01:36:11] <FunkyBob> however, "on deman" would require different solutions
[01:36:41] <GinFuyou> {% include "form_template.html" with form=form_01 %}

[01:38:14] <FunkyBob> no
[01:38:33] <FunkyBob> take the page you have now... abstract out the modal-with-form part into a separate template
[01:38:42] <FunkyBob> render _all_ forms as separate modals
[01:38:56] <FunkyBob> select the modal to show based on the users chocie

[02:42:58] <GinFuyou> name error perhaps? I don't remember if Form has a clean() placeholder or something else
[02:43:17] <GinFuyou> though sounds like purely theoretical question
[02:43:44] <theprophet> GinFuyou would you say it is better if i write a clean method in forms.py?
[02:44:24] <theprophet> cause thats how its suppose to be?
[02:44:46] <GinFuyou> Do you need a clean() method?
[02:45:20] <theprophet> not 100%

[02:45:42] <theprophet> but kind of good to see whats happening behind the scenes
[02:46:29] <GinFuyou> Well, forms are quite complext under the hood if you see their code. But normally you don't need those details to use them
[02:47:08] <theprophet> i see
[02:47:16] <GinFuyou> You might be interested in clean(), clean_<fieldname>(), __init__() and save()
[02:47:46] <GinFuyou> django docs on cleaning should cover first two cases
[02:48:06] *** Joins: rje (~textual@65.141.156.170)
[02:48:19] <theprophet> ok, thank you very much
[02:48:25] <GinFuyou> init possible usage was also explained somewhere, but I'm not sure which section
[02:53:10] <theprophet> GinFuyou does this look normal to you? https://dpaste.org/dPcT
[02:54:42] <theprophet> would you change anything just by looking at it?
[02:56:01] <theprophet> i think, from what you said, that def function is unecessary
[02:56:14] <theprophet> in forms.py
[02:58:01] <GinFuyou> looks fine to me. That method only prints the cleaned data, so if you don't need print you can remove it
[02:58:44] <theprophet> yea, i was just trying to print debug
[02:58:50] <GinFuyou> clean() is good when you need to validate data among several fields. good example checking if two new password inputs match for registration forms
[02:58:53] <FunkyBob> it should redirect after valid...
[02:59:12] <GinFuyou> oh, right, my bad
[02:59:41] <GinFuyou> redirect to the same view (usually) to get a new clean form
[02:59:50] <FunkyBob> yeah, there's a whole page fo the docs devoted to customising validation, how it works, and when you'd use which option
[03:00:03] <GinFuyou> or detail view of the created object for example. Which makes more sense
[03:00:05] <FunkyBob> GinFuyou: imho, ideally to a different view
[03:00:21] <FunkyBob> yah, a detail view, or a list view... but not t he same form, generally
[03:01:07] <theprophet> GinFuyou if i remove that def func, will is_valid still call clean()?
[03:01:08] <GinFuyou> I guess I'm tired ^_^" Yeah, agreed.
[03:01:41] <FunkyBob> theprophet: the base Form class has it already
[03:01:47] <FunkyBob> so if you don't define it, it will inherit it
[03:01:56] <GinFuyou> theprophet, I don't remember implementation detials. Probably it will just a placeholder clean() method that does nothing
[03:01:59] <theprophet> i see
[03:02:07] <FunkyBob> https://github.com/django/django/blob/main/django/forms/forms.py#L469
[03:02:11] <GinFuyou> It doesn't affect anything
[03:02:47] <GinFuyou> Oh, so this part I remember correctly
[03:03:07] <theprophet> aha, i see , so no function means __all__ fields.
[03:03:48] <FunkyBob> pardon?
[03:04:05] <theprophet> no
[03:04:09] <theprophet> mistake
[03:04:15] <theprophet> i mean no fields
[03:04:20] <FunkyBob> ah, the non-field errors thing

[03:04:31] <theprophet> yes
[03:05:57] <theprophet> at first i tought that , is_valid() would automaticly call clean() FunkyBob in views.py
[03:06:15] <theprophet> then i changed my mind, cause i was confused
[03:06:28] <FunkyBob> it will
[03:06:38] <theprophet> yes today guys here told me

[03:08:16] <theprophet> and here i am with my question
[03:08:58] <GinFuyou> It's just me, but I prefer first getting the basic usage of tool, and only then diving into details how it works and what else I can do with it
[03:09:37] <GinFuyou> Pretty sure if I'd tried to figure ot Form code when I first learned Django, I'd break
[03:09:55] <GinFuyou> * source code I mean
[03:10:41] <theprophet> i dont get what ur saying, basic usage? like just do what it does get used to it?
[03:12:09] <theprophet> because, knowing basic usage of is_valid() go me lost , since the idea behind it was not enough to basicly use forms.cleaned_data
[03:12:22] <GinFuyou> Do a tutorial task. Try to do something of your own design. Do something more advanced you can think of. Get used to the tool
[03:12:51] <theprophet> 1 thing at a time huh

I am trying to generate reports dynamically for users, and would like to do so in a second or two rather than batching them, but batching is also an option if that works easiest/best

[15:52:04] <nbjoerg> reportlab certainly has been used for that purpose a lot. it can be a bit more cumbersome to use, especially if you are not used to it
[15:53:11] <nbjoerg> if you have a html version of what your reports look like, you can easily try if the performance is good enough with xhtml2pdf or weasyprint, the question for the former then becomes whether to stick with the extra layer or go for straight reportlab

[22:05:27] <soul-d> just spend half an hour why the tutorial din't give me the "error_message" , but while making paste bin i see that i typed error_msg in the html XD
[22:08:11] <jim> you're doing one of the tutorials?
[22:08:44] <soul-d> yeh the basic poll one from the website
[22:10:02] <jim> I dunno if this has anything to do with anything, it's just something I found useful: have the server running, and making its log output in a separate terminal... then, every time you save a file, take a look at the server log

[22:12:50] <jim> in my case, I did a lot of typos, and it was useful to look at the server log every time I saved a file, because I'd get syntax errors, and name errors mostly
[22:13:21] <soul-d> is there sepperate log file thats diffrent then just the terminal output ?
[22:14:13] <jim> I think that would be the log... it seems to combine the error log and the access log

[22:17:44] <soul-d> im just using the basic "python manage.py runserver" so haven't seen  it creates any files ( also on windows)
[22:19:14] <moldy> yeah it doesn't, it logs to stdout
[22:19:55] <soul-d> ah well at least now i know to double check the  python stuff in nested the html XD

[22:58:09] <evilpyro> Hello, I just wanted to know if i can combine two or more forms/modelform into one so than i can pass it to a FormView
[22:58:51] <carlio> evilpyro: not sure but you might be needing a Formset - https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/forms/formsets/
[23:00:35] <evilpyro> but formset uses multiple forms of the same instance right? I want to combine two or mode modelforms
[23:00:46] <evilpyro> different modelforms
[23:01:43] <carlio> ah ok I misunderstood then sorry!
[23:02:53] *** Quits: azed (~azed@197.23.130.142) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[23:02:55] <evilpyro> lets say i have a Post and an Article models (an article is a type of post), then I have two ModelForm (one for each model), but I want to display into a FormView a <form> with the fields of a PostForm and an ArticleForm combined
[23:04:41] *** Quits: gitly (~gitly@85.255.233.194) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[23:05:02] <carlio> forms can take a "prefix" option to change the generated IDs/names in the HTML elements, but you'd have to handle the POST data yourself probably. I'm not aware if FormView can do it for you, but I could be wrong.
[23:06:11] <evilpyro> yeah, right now i have a function based view that just passes two forms with a prefix as you say, but Its kind of a mess. I'd like to use a generic FormView but this only supports a single form
