[01:54:57] <tcarls[m]> Aaaargh. Was stuffing received content into a SQLite database, but wasn't looking at how it was treated once there; had a bunch of strings (containing numeric characters) coerced into floating-point values.
[01:55:17] <tcarls[m]> revises DDL to use datatype names that SQLite recognizes
[02:01:41] <tcarls[m]> I don't see pyzmq listed as a dependency in https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio/blob/main/.packaging/fedora/gnuradio.spec -- am I missing something?
[02:07:01] <tcarls[m]> (context of the above is trying to establish whether https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/158070, adding pyzmq as a dependency to the NixOS package, is firmly correct to the satisfaction of that package's maintainer).

[15:47:33] <DerekKozel[m]> Hi, loads of folks idle here. Did something happen on the IRC side?
[15:47:42] <tnt> MrCircuitMatt: that's a matrix bridge thing
[15:49:17] *** Joins: dkozel1 (~dkozel@159.65.28.135)
[15:49:21] <MrCircuitMatt> Yamakaja[m]: I just noticed several days in a row that there seems to be a big burst of "Quit: You have been kicked for being idle" disconnects... but OK thx tnt then it's just a matrix thing...
[15:49:56] <Yamakaja[m]> Oh i see, those don't appear over here on matrix ^^
[15:51:05] *** Quits: oem22 (xyz@151.30.129.165) (Quit: Going offline, see ya! (www.adiirc.com))
[15:51:06] <tnt> AFAIU it's just the "fake users" that the bridge creates on the IRC side. They'll be re-created if that person ever talks.
[15:51:09] <dkozel1> Hopefully that's basically "garbage collection" happening for Matrix users bridging into IRC. The Matrix room preserves history so they don't need to be actively presented on the IRC side to get it, 
[15:51:33] <dkozel1> Though it does obscure who is idle on the Matrix end.
[15:51:37] <clever> dkozel1: yeah, as long as the bridge has 1 user in the channel, the history will be recorded
[15:51:38] <MrCircuitMatt> apparently that happens at 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. CET, e.g. earlier today that disconnected 250+ people. Not a big deal for me, it's just that I periodically open this tab and when I see so many disconnects I wonder what's going on :-)

[15:52:20] <dkozel1> If it's only a recent behavior I wonder if Element Matrix Services was tidying up ahead of FOSDEM's surge of users.

[15:52:48] <tnt> It's not recent.

[15:54:22] <DerekKozel[m]> Possibly linked to this
[15:54:49] <clever> yeah, in the freenode days, i always refered to a bridge restart as "getting matrixed", because it just spammed the crap out of things :P

[15:55:32] <DerekKozel[m]> I've always set those types of messages to ignore unless the user was active in the last few minutes.
