[11:26:38] <sinus1> welp,i'm not a metal head and i've never been into metal but i got addicted to this album these last couple months
[11:26:45] <sinus1> I would say it's linkin park but rebranded
[11:27:29] <novns> the only good linkin park's song is a cover ow the who
[11:27:33] <novns> *of
[11:27:42] <novns> and the who did it better
[11:28:10] * novns is starting some flame wars
[11:28:23] <sinus1> bruh i gotta disagree here,Hybrid Theory and Living Things are one of my favorite rock albums
[11:28:58] <sinus1> but as i said i aint a metal/rock head soo
[11:29:10] <novns> I would love to hear them but you didn't provide any link
[11:30:29] <sinus1> i'm new to IRCs,how do i provide links ?
[11:30:44] <novns> copy & paste them
[11:32:11] <sinus1> spotify link would do it ?
[11:32:33] <novns> no, it requires registration

[11:45:25] <novns> it sounds like 100500 other similar songs
[11:45:28] <sinus1> novns, what song did you check ?
[11:45:48] <novns> Dear Diary
[11:47:30] <novns> sinus1, metal music is a very limiting genre, it's all about typical drums sounds, typical guitar distortions, typical vocal styles
[11:47:49] <novns> they all sound the same and never invent new things
[11:47:59] <sinus1> novns, i mean dear diary is one of the least favorites in this album try kingslayer
[11:48:04] <sinus1> and yes metal is generic
[11:48:09] <sinus1> so is every other genre
[11:48:13] <novns> no
[11:48:50] <novns> prog rock from 70s was like each song is played by another band
[11:49:18] <novns> they tried hard to invent things and they did a lot of experimental stuff
[11:49:20] <sinus1> gimme examples ?

[11:52:53] <novns> sinus1, even a single song from there contain so much material so you can make 10 songs out of it
