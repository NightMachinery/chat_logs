[03:22:13] <push-f> hey folks, why do you use a dedicated IRC bouncer like ZNC as opposed to e.g. running some terminal client via tmux/screen?
[03:22:14] *** Parts: horvathkari (~hk@user/horvathkari) ()
[03:24:23] <MetaNova> push-f: agnostic to client, no input latency (have you ever tried typing something in an SSH session which was lagging badly? as if mobile IRCing wasn't bad enough), independent modules, independent alerts/highlights
[03:25:49] <MetaNova> I also don't like my connection being at the mercy of any client issues
[03:26:01] <MetaNova> like loading a script which doesn't work "as expected"
[03:26:21] <MetaNova> or module, or calling something disastrous from /exec, or anything
[03:28:15] <push-f> thanks for elaborating :)
[03:29:32] <push-f> what can the modules do? how are "independent alerts/highlights" implemented? I assume as PMs?
[03:30:18] <MetaNova> yes
[03:30:38] <MetaNova> push-f: my favorite example of why having separate modules from clients is [[Ignore]]
[03:30:38] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/Ignore
[03:30:56] <MetaNova> my client of choice, hexchat, can only ignore based on nick!user@host
[03:31:07] <MetaNova> no pattern matching, *ignore allows me to filter by regex
[03:31:17] <MetaNova> something more flexible/capable clients, like weechat, can do
[03:32:06] <MetaNova> with *ignore, perhaps more so for most people, is the appeal of having a shared ignore list
[03:32:34] <MetaNova> [[Modules]]
[03:32:34] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/Modules
[03:33:48] <MetaNova> [[Watch]] allows you to watch for certain things
[03:33:48] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/Watch
[03:33:55] <MetaNova> again, independent of client
[03:35:25] <MetaNova> then there's bindhost management
[03:36:31] <push-f> does ZNC multiplex client connections to the IRC server?
[03:36:49] <push-f> or does it create a new connection for each client?
[03:36:51] <MetaNova> yes, you can attach to the same user/network in ZNC from multiple clients
[03:37:02] <MetaNova> [[Multiple_clients]]
[03:37:02] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/Multiple_clients
[03:37:51] <MetaNova> push-f on libera can be used simultaneously from user@tablet/network user@desktop/network user@work/network

[03:39:31] <push-f> how does channel management work with a bouncer?
[03:39:49] <MetaNova> you /join and /part channels like you would at any other time
[03:40:26] <MetaNova> except now, you can add/change/remove channels from the webadmin panel (web frontend for ZNC management, [[Webadmin]]), as well as do things like detach channels
[03:40:26] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/Webadmin
[03:40:38] <MetaNova> (retain their buffer, but not display them to the client)
[03:41:03] <push-f> if I join a channel on one device am I also joined on another device?
[03:41:13] <MetaNova> yes
[03:41:22] *** j is now known as jess
[03:42:48] <push-f> can you list your detached channels?
[03:42:57] <MetaNova> yes
[03:43:04] <push-f> how?
[03:43:11] <MetaNova> /msg *status listchans
[03:43:39] <MetaNova> [snip]
[03:43:40] <MetaNova> <*status> Total: 91, Joined: 91, Detached: 1, Disabled: 0
[03:45:14] <MetaNova> and in webadmin, within Your Settings -> Edit Network, channels and their status is displayed
[03:45:22] <MetaNova> "Detached" will be shown
[03:47:12] <push-f> when I connect to ZNC from a device for the first time will I be joined to all my channels?
[03:47:17] <MetaNova> yes
[03:47:34] <MetaNova> unless any are detached, or you've done something fancy such as implementing [[Chanfilter]]
[03:47:34] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/Chanfilter
[03:47:53] <MetaNova> which can, on a per-client basis, control what channels are displayed (while all of them remain joined)
[03:48:43] <push-f> how does that work? can an IRC server join you into a channel?
[03:49:47] <push-f> (I am used to the client deciding in which channels I am joined)
[03:51:07] <MetaNova> yes, an IRC server can force a client to join a channel
[03:51:17] <push-f> interesting
[03:51:39] <MetaNova> unreal has sa_join, other servers have fjoin

[04:42:48] <Hex> Okay, I have an issue. I've set up the ZNC all well and good; I can connect to the web GUI, it's connected to my specified networks, etc. However, whenever I try to connect to the bouncer via a client (IRSSI, if that matters), it just stalls for awhile before throwing: 
[04:42:48] <Hex> > 00:11 -!- Irssi: Unable to connect server [IP] port 3000 [Connection timed out]
[04:42:48] <Hex> Any ideas as to what's going on/how to fix it? 
[04:43:55] <MetaNova> same port as webadmin?

[04:48:34] <MetaNova> then I'm left with two main concerns

[15:25:30] <Atario> hello helpful people.  having a problem getting into freenode (yeah, i know, i'm wanting to keep hanging around in my old channel in case any stragglers come in), ever since they started requiring sasl, even though i've always connected with sasl.  hexchat on my windows box doesn't have a problem, just znc on my server.  both are behind the same router.  any clues?

[20:36:50] <MetaNova> Atario: be sure the account is fully registered (that includes the registration verification -- although, at least on /old/ freenode (atheme) an unverified nick could be authed to via SASL, but I'm not sure about Anope), be sure the *sasl module is attempting at least PLAIN (default is to try EXTERNAL and then PLAIN, /msg *sasl mechanism), re-specify your registered nick and nickserv password (/msg *sasl set nick pass), turn verbose on and 
[20:36:50] <MetaNova> initiate a reconnect and observe the output from *sasl (/msg *sasl verbose yes ; /msg *status connect)
[20:40:57] <Atario> MetaNova, *sasl just gives me "PLAIN mechanism failed." and then i get the closing link message from freenode
[20:42:44] <Atario> the nick & pass i made sure of by reentering the same ones in both hexchat (direct, not through znc) and *sasl
[20:43:46] <MetaNova> and you claim the /exact/ same nick and pass are accepted via SASL via HexChat?
[20:43:54] <Atario> yeah
[20:44:11] <MetaNova> that is
[20:44:13] <MetaNova> odd
[20:44:30] <MetaNova> does the password contain any special characters? :? @?
[20:45:13] <Atario> it does have a :
[20:45:33] <MetaNova> aha
[20:45:50] <MetaNova> so, in *sasl, try specifying the password prepended with a :
[20:46:13] <MetaNova> if your password were "mypa:ss" for example, try specifying ":my:pass"
[20:46:34] <MetaNova> ":mypa:ss" rather
[20:46:43] <MetaNova> such that: /msg *sasl set Atario :mypa:ss
[20:47:25] <Atario> same result
[20:47:33] <MetaNova> hm.
[20:48:00] <Atario> one thing i notice is that about half the time, it will give me "Cannot connect to IRC (Network is unreachable). Retrying..." when i try to connect
[20:48:28] <Atario> which seems strange
[20:49:30] <MetaNova> that's likely some weird combination of the round-robin not being updated (to include IP addresses not in rotation/are at the time unreachable), stale DNS cache in ZNC, or just plain weird connectivity between your ZNC host and freenode
[20:49:34] <MetaNova> or freenode just being stupid
[20:49:55] <Atario> very possible heh
[20:50:35] <MetaNova> my bouncer is very reliable, and even then, I will occasionally see one network or another go into a "network unreachable" or "ping timeout" loop until whatever was the problem gets resolved
[20:50:43] <MetaNova>  12:20:37 up 416 days, 17:14,  1 user,  load average: 0.14, 0.12, 0.11
[20:50:49] <Atario> dang
[20:51:01] <MetaNova> it really depends on both ends of the route
[20:51:52] <MetaNova> unless you know /what/ is wrong, or if all networks are affected, the best you can do is just wait until a server connects
[20:52:00] <MetaNova> but that's entirely separate from your specific issue here
[20:52:33] <Atario> okay
[20:52:41] <MetaNova> I'm looking at the github issues and I do not see an open (or closed) issue regarding the *sasl module and a password including a ":"
[20:52:52] <MetaNova> I'd encourage you to open one
[20:53:23] <MetaNova> Atario: the password isn't exceptionally long, is it?
[20:53:55] <Atario> it's as long as they allow (i think?), which is 32 chars
[20:54:21] <MetaNova> oh. I was hoping https://github.com/znc/znc/commit/75475972d7647828ea24263b5097b2039c03b820 may have solved it
[20:54:30] <MetaNova> but 32 characters shouldn't be a problem
[20:54:32] <Atario> should i try changing it to one with no : and see if it starts working?
[20:54:44] <MetaNova> that is what I was about to suggest in the meantime as a workaround, yes.
[21:00:16] <Atario> nope, didn't help
[21:00:29] <MetaNova> so you'
[21:00:30] <MetaNova> er
[21:00:46] <MetaNova> so you're saying *sasl fails to auth you even with a password containing no special characters?
[21:01:01] <Atario> there are still special chars, just no : now
[21:01:33] <MetaNova> you could try expanding your workaround so that no special characters are part of the password
[21:01:52] <MetaNova> and then re-add them, one at a time, to determine which ones (specifically) are not accepted
[21:01:56] <Atario> so just [a-zA-Z0-9]?
[21:02:01] <MetaNova> for the moment, yes
[21:06:27] <Atario> unbelievably enough, still no dice
[21:09:38] <MetaNova> okay, that means something else is very wrong

[21:13:40] <Atario> there's nothing special i need to do to tell *sasl which network i mean, right?  like, it knows which network i'm at and knows to put that password with that network?  or am i overwriting a single set of credentials that are supposed to be for separate networks with a single one?
[21:13:46] <MetaNova> and, are you in control of this instance yourself, or is this someone else's bouncer?
[21:13:53] <Atario> it's my own instance
[21:14:19] <MetaNova> Atario: as *sasl is a network module, it applies only for the network which you are current attached to

[22:03:09] <Atario> i'm on ubuntu 16.04.6 lts, this is what they have in the standard repo  :/
[22:08:27] <MetaNova> Atario: well, okay
[22:09:09] <MetaNova> here's a rough one-liner to 1) make a backup of your ZNC configuration directory, 2) install the necessary packages to compile ZNC, 3) fetch source/compile/install ZNC:
[22:09:15] <MetaNova> tar --no-auto-compress -vcSpWf .znc.tar ~/.znc ; sudo apt-get build-dep znc ; mkdir ~/builds ; cd ~/builds ; wget https://znc.in/releases/znc-1.8.2.tar.gz ; tar xf znc-1.8.2.tar.gz ; cd znc-1.8.2 ; ./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-debug ; make ; sudo make install
[22:10:27] <MetaNova> (the conf dir backup is mostly a sanity-check, ZNC should have zero issues importing/upgrading an existing conf dir)
[22:10:40] <MetaNova> but, depending on your environment, you may need to change this
[22:17:42] <Atario> guh, looks like 16.04 went out of support in april.  i might finally have to bite the bullet and upgrade.  although it looks like for this specific problem, even that would only bring me up to znc 1.7.5
