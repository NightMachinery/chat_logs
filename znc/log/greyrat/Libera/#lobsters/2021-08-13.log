[03:10:51] <technomancy> ok so I have a conundrum. I have a project where I distribute compiled binaries (yeah ok, so maybe that's my first mistake) and I have it all set up with gcc variants to cross-compile to arm32 and windows from my old laptop. (thinkpad, debian stable) works perfectly.

[03:11:37] <technomancy> I got a new laptop and it's arm64 running sid. I fixed up all my cross-compiling and now I have it all running on that system; I can build x86_64 binaries just fine. but the glibc is too new now so it won't run on most machines.
[03:13:06] <technomancy> do I: 0) keep the old laptop around just for releasing 1) move the compilation to CI and sign the binaries anyway even though they were built on someone else's machine 2) switch to musl 3) use a chroot to put old glibc on my new computer
[03:13:42] <technomancy> (before anyone says it, docker is right out)
[03:13:56] <Ticho> I'd go with chroot or docker :)
[03:14:29] <technomancy> I looked up the official musl docs and clicked on "cross-compiling musl" and it 404'd so that's not a great sign
[03:15:14] <technomancy> do you know a good tl;dr document describing the chroot process?
[03:15:48] <Ticho> you might not even need a chroot, just a separate glibc version installed in a directory somewhere - https://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/Testing/Builds?action=recall&rev=21#Compile_against_glibc_in_an_installed_location

[03:16:59] <technomancy> Ticho: I don't actually know C so that glibc wiki link is waaaay over my head
[03:18:11] <Ticho> as I'm reading it closer, it's probably not what you want anyway, as the resulting binaries will likely contain your custom rpath, which is probably not what you want
[03:18:42] <Ticho> it's meant for temporary testing binaries

[04:15:26] <technomancy> but going from a dependency list of "gcc, make, and curl" to "now go track down and compile this new compiler that is certainly not in your package manager" is a big leap, even if zig is much better than gcc.
[04:16:36] <technomancy> plus I think this problem with `strip' wouldn't be solved by that anyway

[04:16:57] <technomancy> no, I have all that stuff working fine in a chroot

[04:21:14] <technomancy> so the intel strip happens to work for intel windows

[04:31:19] <dsc_> generally there are some frustrations for CMake but for cross compiling it is quite nice how you can point CMake towards your own 'toolchain file' which is basically some variables/options to point CMake towards your sysroot and toolchain directory. CMake then generates a Makefile based on what it was able to discover. If the project you are trying to compile only has a Makefile you'll be (often) forced to
[04:31:25] <dsc_> modify it which is unwanted as it is probably a part of git
