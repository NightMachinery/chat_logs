[23:45:03] <MadCamel> I think the original spirit of open source is doomed anyway regardless of what MS does.
[23:45:36] <lall-> why would you think such a thing
[23:45:49] <mats1> indeed, commoditisation of computers resulted in open sores
[23:46:02] <MadCamel> People do not have the free time that they used to. Finances are tighter. Life's more of a hustle. Unless you're getting paid for it who has time to work on some OSS project? Not as many people as before

[23:47:56] <mats1> computers were better when they cost a year's wages and the filth of the earth couldn't have em
[23:48:18] <lall-> the ecosystem was maybe better, in some specific way
[23:48:27] <mats1> yes, OS thrives so well, they added a few tens millions of lines to it, without apparently subtracting anything
[23:48:34] <mats1> amazing progress!
[23:49:35] <lall-> nowdays you got massive contributions from large companies, including MS...they politically are cunts still, but they did contribute, same facebook or google. Look, i've been using linux as main OS since 1997, i can tel you one thing... linux desktop still sucks in many ways, but is light years ahead of what it was 20 years ago.
[23:49:51] <MadCamel> it thrives at the shovelware level. the millions of nodejs libraries and so forth that people wrote to make it easier for them to make money. But when you look at unexciting but vital projects further down the stack such as glibc they are rotting from lack of attention.
[23:50:25] <mats1> orgs paying shitheads like poettering to crap on linux is how we got systemd, pulseaudio, etc
[23:50:31] <lall-> ok

[23:50:45] <mats1> foss dun need them. their money and their agents are toxic.
[23:50:58] <lall-> he's a shithead, but that's not FOSS...that's just redhat and their own agenda
[23:51:07] <lall-> not foss related
[23:51:42] <mats1> i guess if you squint real carefully, you can't see systemd
[23:51:53] <lall-> foss is an idea, systemd and redhat is a product

[23:52:59] <mats1> not just systemd -- kdbus, avahi, openssl, avahi, there are many turds
[23:53:10] *** Joins: danielrparks (~quassel@2600:1700:3f7b:20f:b07a:85ad:9ad0:9a9c)
[23:53:14] <mats1> avahi is terrible.
[23:53:26] <MadCamel> I guess what i'm trying to say is that it has pivoted from a bunch of nerds working on things they're passionate about to a bunch of people trying to make money. OSS won't die but RMS's vision of free software is long gone.
[23:53:48] <mats1> i love foss, don't get me wrong. but it died a long time ago.
[23:53:52] <lall-> things certainly changed.
[23:55:23] <MadCamel> oh well, can either move on with the times or be an old codger.. so onward we go in our travels.
[23:55:32] <mats1> soft development is a lemon market, and the tools of the hour are descriptive of the state of the art
[23:56:01] <mats1> consider proliferation of mentally retarded people who need to pull a npm thing to do left or right padding,
[23:56:07] <lall-> i wouldn't say that FOSS died though. You have so many awesome products today (that arenot commercial, but still follow the OS philosophy and community contributions)
[23:56:11] <mats1> or the blather over 'copilot', 'tabnine', etc
[23:57:37] <lall-> just because redhat has domineering political ideas, don't mean that FOSS is dead
[23:57:57] <lall-> i always got frustrated that Linus never said anything about that.
[23:58:03] <mats1> there's plenty of social problems in foss also
[23:58:06] <lall-> as i think that his opinion has weight..
[23:58:19] <mats1> linus caved to the shitbirds and their codes of conduct
[23:58:34] <lall-> he did shit on systemd one time
[23:58:38] <lall-> but not enough, IMO.
[23:59:05] <lall-> it was something about systemd trying to be an init system and a DNS resolver or something like that.
[23:59:59] <mats1> time was, he had a spine, and would piss all over the human resources / diversity officer types, when they rang the door
