[03:18:08] <TheWild> done
[03:18:12] <TheWild> the screen blinked
[03:18:14] <curdlesnoot> TheWild: try them all. if nothing looks good, poke around in your TV settings and see if there's a way to instruct the TV as the the colourspace/range it should expect on a given port.
[03:18:25] <curdlesnoot> TheWild: I know how to do this for modern-ish Sony TVs only.
[03:19:15] <curdlesnoot> HDMI is supposed to auto-negotiate for "automatic" but it only takes one of the devices to have other plans.
[03:20:40] <curdlesnoot> also, there's a chart you can use to check whether the rgb quantisation level is properly in agreement but that's probably premature at this stage.

[05:02:16] <curdlesnoot> not all drives were manufactured equal, for that matter. I recall once testing a pile of floppy drives with a DOS utility whose name now escapes me.

[05:05:05] <Sauvin> blackgatonegro, the 3.5" floppies had higher densities, 3.5" drives had smaller RW heads, and the whole get-up was a lot more sensitive to bit rot.
[05:05:08] <blackgatonegro> It was a pain.

[06:56:03] <Gustavo6046> ayecee: yeah, it requires yielding control
[06:56:09] <ayecee> okay, is _that_ bad
[06:56:13] <Gustavo6046> especially for processes that call write() and read() often, it's quite a bit of redundant overhead

[06:56:50] <Gustavo6046> so if a process calls write() and read() *sporadically* and in bursts, these changes shall buffer till X ms have passed
[06:57:23] <ayecee> that must be why stdio is buffered already
[06:57:36] <Gustavo6046> true, but I don't mean stdio
[06:57:49] <ayecee> no, but something that does the same thing
[06:57:52] <Gustavo6046> file IO is often buffered (file cache) but this buffering comes after the syscalls so it's not really helpful here
[06:58:08] *** Joins: darkbit (~db@152.32.99.67)
[06:58:24] <ayecee> okay like allocating that "virtual memory" is going to involve a context switch too
[06:58:51] * rascul switches the context
[06:59:19] <Gustavo6046> either way, if a process calls write() and read() evenly through time, especially one that is seldom on idle sleep, it might be a game or another program that more on IO latency enough to justify the tradeoff of a bit of overhead; there, the special instructions would still apply, but context switching would happen right away, instead of a few cycles down the line
[06:59:33] <Gustavo6046> ayecee: it would be done on init. and then sub-allocated by open()
[06:59:44] <Gustavo6046> file open or socket open or etc
[06:59:47] <Gustavo6046> basically for any FD
[07:00:14] <Gustavo6046> on init as in, on spawn()/fork()
[07:00:20] <ayecee> so like a fixed allocation of memory for every process
[07:00:31] <Gustavo6046> yeah, although it would be sparse

[07:00:46] <Gustavo6046> suballocation
[07:00:49] <ayecee> no
[07:00:51] <Gustavo6046> it would be unsparse to a fixed block size
[07:01:05] <Gustavo6046> because having to sparsely allocate everytime you write or read something would be antithetic to the goal of not needing syscalls
[07:01:09] <ayecee> "sparse" memory, when used, triggers a page fault
[07:01:26] <Gustavo6046> that would happen on a file descriptor open

[07:01:54] <Gustavo6046> the block size would adjust to the average write/read size between the vmem IO queue flush intervals determined by the aforementioned metric
[07:02:07] <Gustavo6046> (where a game would have a lower interval, or even just an immediate flag, for its metric would be more even than sporadic)
[07:02:46] <ayecee> i can't really follow what your idea is. it seems to be some sort of magic to solve a single problem, "syscalls bad".
[07:02:51] <Gustavo6046> running a system update in theb ackground, so everything is slow as heck
[07:02:58] <Gustavo6046> ayecee: syscalls are overhead
[07:03:09] <Gustavo6046> this is virtual-memory-based syscall deference
[07:03:24] <ayecee> which would have its own overhead
[07:03:44] <Gustavo6046> yeah but it wouldn't happen all the time
[07:04:01] <ayecee> syscalls don't happen all the time either
[07:04:02] <Gustavo6046> I think IO overhead is somewhat redundant, at least in terms of how it requires context switching for every single read/write call, it just feels... squanderous to me, but maybe that's just me
[07:04:16] <ayecee> i think it is
[07:04:33] <Gustavo6046> hm
[07:06:12] <danieldg> Gustavo6046: note that a page fault is quite a bit more expensive than a system call, even before you do any page table changes - syscall is a faster context switch instruction than a trap/fault

[07:10:15] <danieldg> Gustavo6046: it's called the inode cache, and it doesn't swap - it just gets deleted and can be recreated on demand

[07:10:34] <Gustavo6046> well, it's a cache though

[07:12:56] <byte4byte_> Gustavo6046, you gonna take that?
[07:13:26] <ayecee> Gustavo6046: you're talking at length about something you barely understand and arguing with people about it.
[07:13:50] <Gustavo6046> danieldg: but how would the process (or rather, its microcode thingy) know which part of vmem to write to? it's not so much a cache in this case
[07:13:56] <byte4byte_> now he calling you dumb

[07:14:19] <ayecee> i'm not saying you're pushing anything.
[07:14:20] <danieldg> Gustavo6046: no, this is kernel code
[07:14:38] <danieldg> Gustavo6046: you should understand how it works before making changes
[07:15:12] <ayecee> eh. maybe not that. making changes would be a way to find out how it works.
[07:15:26] <ayecee> _talking_ about making changes, not so much
[07:15:36] <danieldg> ayecee: ok, point
[07:18:05] <Gustavo6046> I don't mean to make changes, but yeah
[07:18:17] <ayecee> you should make changes
[07:18:23] <Gustavo6046> just maybe someone would be able to concoct a more useful idea from my ramblings :p
[07:18:36] <ayecee> not likely
[07:19:02] <danieldg> Gustavo6046: the way to make that happen is to build a system with the changes you propose and show it's faster in benchmark X
[07:19:22] <Gustavo6046> rather than having it be in kernel, my idea was that the kernel could have its own microcode that slightly alters CPU instructions from executables as they are loaded in order to allow some flexibility in implementing some of the lower level mechanisms that directly involve the code being executed, such as this; for instance, in my idea, it'd replace syscalls to write/read *if* this functionality
[07:19:23] <Gustavo6046> was enabled for that process
[07:19:28] <ayecee> come on man
[07:19:44] <ayecee> you type fast, but maybe type less
[07:20:05] <danieldg> Gustavo6046: so, prototype that out
[07:20:15] <Gustavo6046> hmm
[07:20:21] <Gustavo6046> that sounds scary for some reason

[09:36:06] <hexnewbie> The horror stories with reiserfsck mainly result from the rebuild tree image vulnerability, otherwise reiserfs is quite robust and the rebuild tree makes it able to recover from failures other filesystems wouldn't

[12:36:33] <hexnewbie> With nbd neither have I. It's just simpler than the competition.
[12:38:43] <Sauvin> What's not simple about sshfs?
[12:38:48] <pasiz> but how you can share loopback device
[12:38:56] *** Quits: arcturus (~arcturus@gateway/tor-sasl/arcturus) (Remote host closed the connection)
[12:38:59] <hexnewbie> Not clear. sshfs seems to be the thing to go to
[12:39:14] <toretto> using a mounted fs path on the export also doesn't help either.
[12:39:16] <pasiz> and why
[12:39:28] *** Quits: takimbal (~takimbal@linuxhq/tkimball) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[12:39:40] <pasiz> toretto: could you explain clearly your goal
[12:39:55] <toretto> sshfs for my usecase is too slower. That's the reason why I didn't go with sshfs.
[12:40:01] <toretto> because my blockdevies will be larger.
[12:40:28] <hexnewbie> Block-level sharing usually has more overhead than a network filesystem, though one can use NFS or CIFS in place of sshfs
[12:41:25] <pasiz> toretto: could you explain your goal, would be fastest path to get somewhere
[12:41:25] <toretto> so you're saying just using sshfs will have less overhead(speed advantage) over using nbd?
[12:41:39] <pasiz> toretto: nfs have less overhead
[12:42:00] *** Quits: chives (~chives@24.35.204.107) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[12:42:00] <pasiz> but try first telling with own words what you are trying to achieve
[12:42:07] <hexnewbie> I have not benchmarked that option, sshfs encrypts and sends POSIX-like calls for open, read, etc. over the wire.

[12:42:48] <hexnewbie> It should still be faster than reading filesystem structures directly from a remote block device, but there's no guarantee
[12:42:52] *** Joins: takimbal (~takimbal@linuxhq/tkimball)
[12:42:58] <toretto> pasiz: I've a local block device which I wanted to mount on my remote linux server so that I can use the files for the applications on demand on the server without having to transfer/sync the file between my server and local machine.
[12:43:15] <toretto> I've tried sshfs for that, but it's was too slow.
[12:43:31] <pasiz> toretto: export it via nfs. for that use case, fastest

[12:43:45] <toretto> ok, i'll look at nfs
[12:43:53] <pasiz> you cannot mount same block device on 2 machines
[12:44:18] <hexnewbie> Well, not without massive corruption or a clustering file system (which is usually even slower)
[12:44:21] <pasiz> or maybe can, but for fs, that would be catastrophe

[17:55:00] <Psi-Jack> Often times you cannot change the CPU on a laptop.
[17:55:09] <kish`> for some reason this install decided for 1GB of SWap for 8GB of ram
[17:55:15] <Psi-Jack> These days, replacing RAM and storage is getting limited.
[17:55:16] <kish`> is there a way to increase swap??
[17:55:22] *** Joins: Iamthehuman1 (~noname@user/iamthehuman)
[17:55:26] <Psi-Jack> kish`: You can always add more swap, including a swap file.
[17:55:29] <Psi-Jack> But.
[17:55:49] <Psi-Jack> You shouldn't likely. 2GB swap is max you would ever need, in most situations.
[17:55:49] *** Quits: stipa (~stipa@user/stipa) (Quit: WeeChat 3.3-dev)
[17:55:50] <kish`> this was the default vg setup for this amount of ram :(
[17:56:02] <kish`> I've had 5GB swap use on this one
[17:56:11] <Psi-Jack> 5GB swap is almost always too much.
[17:56:20] <kish`> I mean it's used 5GB
[17:56:24] <[jamez]> kish`:  1GB of swap for 8GB isn't horrible. EVEN if you have a super fast SSD you're going to have a high load from IO if you're using that much swap constantly.
[17:56:26] <kish`> for a system with 8GB
[17:56:38] <Psi-Jack> Yeah, what you need more is actual RAM, not swap.
[17:56:40] <kish`> [jamez], not constantly but rarely
[17:56:42] <slackadelic> 5GB swap partition? holy crap
[17:56:47] <kish`> it was 8GB
[17:56:52] <slackadelic> I've never gone above 2GB

[22:19:55] <quippy> I used to use the OpenVPN client to do what you're describing back in like 2011? lol
[22:20:00] <quippy> on Linux
[22:20:05] <Dagmar> Howeverm it's been pretty easy to do that with BIND alone for like, 20 years now
[22:20:13] <quippy> the kernel is oblivious to this kind of thing so it's obviously not a limitation of "Linux"
[22:20:17] <Psi-Jack> quippy: You used the VPN's DNS servers, 100%

[22:21:10] <Dagmar> It's not "overkill"
[22:21:11] <curdlesnoot> Psi-Jack: ok, I see how it's done. nice.

[22:21:54] <[jamez]> Dagmar:  You say that, but you'd be surprised how many people I've met who can't wrap their brains around bind :|
[22:21:55] <Psi-Jack> Even macOS has this kind of DNS resolver.
[22:21:58] <quippy> that's the same thing that happens -- effectively -- if your name lookup starts with the VPN nameserver instead of a local one
[22:22:01] <Dagmar> nscd commands have been capable of that for some time now
[22:22:09] <Psi-Jack> Where you can make SPECIFIC domains resolve through specific DNS servers, dynamically.

[22:23:40] <quippy> yeah this all seems perfectly feasible before systemd-resolved. Do you mean to say that it's nice that systemd-resolved provides this functionality out of the box and doesn't rely on the upstream VPN nameserver? because alright

[22:24:22] <Dagmar> ...and the people who needed it generally didn't have problems making it happen on their own.
