[00:01:29] <ordos> spinningcat, if you ever hear this "if you're prone to typos then programming isn't for you" it is the worst advice you'll ever receive. Programming gets easier with time. And more fun. Much joy is to be found in code's potential for elegance.
[00:02:29] <spinningcat> yeah agree
[00:02:47] <spinningcat> but when i see easy typos i am pissed off little bit :D
[00:03:06] * ordos seldom gets pissed off, but when he does, it usually involves Blondie101010's fingernails
[00:04:26] <spinningcat> who is seeldom?
[00:09:10] <da_wunder>  spinningcat what I really recommend - read those error messages, those are usually quite clear - as in your case - you just need to understand those error messages
[00:09:25] <da_wunder> spinningcat: and really that is skill that you will need to be developer
[00:14:25] <da_wunder> ordos: that is why I have added that person to my ignore list
[00:14:42] <da_wunder> spinningcat: seldom !== seeldom

[00:37:44] <relipse> stenno: check your pm
[00:40:11] <relipse> anyone want to test out my game level editor?
[00:45:34] <Yesmon> Is it a game named 'level editor'?
[00:48:44] <relipse> Yesmon: no
[00:48:58] <relipse> it is a level editor for my game i'm working on
[00:49:27] <Yesmon> That sounds cool, what kind of game?
[00:53:34] <relipse> its a 2d rpg-like game
[00:53:59] <relipse> pm'ed so i don't get kicked
[00:55:38] * __adrian kicks relipse 
[00:55:42] <__adrian> playfully, of course.
[00:56:00] <relipse> it says i got banned from javascript and i cannot figure out why
[00:58:17] <__adrian> the only answer to that is to politely ask
[00:59:34] <relipse> stenno: why am I banned from #javascript?
[00:59:59] <__adrian> relipse: ask politely *in pm
[01:01:19] <relipse> tried, he must be afk
[01:01:33] <relipse> need to work on my politeness though
[01:02:09] <__adrian> > tried   // be patient
[01:02:22] <spinningcat> relipse,  are you using unity?
[01:05:12] <relipse> spinningcat: i haven't fully decided what i'm using but I think i'm going to use the dom and javascript

[14:53:12] <arash> how important it is to write shorter codes? for example combining two lines of codes when possible or instead of using foreach for example use array_walk when working with arrays?
[14:54:29] <arash> is it really matters? because I'm started to work for a company and they insist I should do that.
[14:55:01] <olle> heh
[14:55:09] <olle> code review decides the readability of the code
[14:56:43] <arash> so its the matter of readability? nothing else?
[15:02:21] <AllenJB> Make it readable, make it correct, make it fast, in that order. It's easier to  spot problems in readable code. Optimization for performance should generally be done on an as-needed basis.

[17:33:18] <Tach> When you develop a project using composer packages and you don't have cli access you need to upload your whole vendor file. As this is really slow because it are LOTS of small files, what is the best way to make this working smooth with a default webhost ?
[17:34:47] <biberu> deploying like it's 1999?
[17:34:59] <__adrian> well for starters, you'd do well to find a better host that allows shell access.
[17:35:13] <__adrian> are you using ftp?
[17:35:28] <biberu> and are you doing this manually?
[17:35:32] <AllenJB> Use a client that supports only uploading changed files.
[17:35:47] <TonyGoFast> Most hosts give at least a limited shell access and require SFTP, I'm surprosed yours doesn't :o
[17:35:49] <__adrian> "very slow" sounds like you're clicking [upload] for each individual file. it shouldn't be slow at all.

[17:37:46] <__adrian> also note: even with shell access, you'd upload your files. don't run composer on production (if that's what you were implying)
[17:41:11] <Tach> __adrian I'm trying to create a way that I don't need to shell at all but also don't want to upload my vendor folder :)
[17:41:34] <Tach> has nothing todo with starters, you could debate if you want a hoster that has it's shell port open
[17:42:15] <__adrian> but i'm not going to. was just a note that a host without shell access is somethinng you should move away from.
[17:42:22] <__adrian> why don't you want to upload vendor/ ?
[17:42:25] <Tach> Yesmon for my own solution I now use FTPS as you can verify the SSL certificate, which is nice
[17:42:29] <Yesmon> Write a php script to execute composer on itself :P
[17:42:36] <__adrian> ...no
[17:42:42] <Yesmon> (that was a joke)
[17:42:47] <__adrian> i know  :)
[17:42:59] <Tach> __adrian lots of small files are always slow, on every system
[17:43:14] <Tach> Yesmon yes that is an option for myself but maybe not for others :)
[17:43:33] <__adrian> even slower where you have a bad internet connection. and?
[17:44:06] <__adrian> (not that i'm agreeing with your assertion there)
[17:44:27] <Yesmon> I'd be lost without shell, I either tar the product up and SCP it over or use git
[17:44:43] <__adrian> "uploading files takes time" is not really a valid reason to not upload files
[17:45:27] <Tach> __adrian I have 1 GB fiber up/down here and my testhost gives me high speed where needed

[17:49:12] <Tach> __adrian some people just think about others, that's what you need to do as developer and I know, most don't (care)

[17:50:21] <Tach> __adrian so others won't have such problem in the future ?
[17:50:28] <biberu> Tach: but why are you uploading the files one by one? and from your own(?) machine?
[17:50:40] <__adrian> your initial question was how to upload a bunch of files on a webhost that doesn't give you shell access. that's been answered, at this point.
[17:50:59] <Tach> biberu why do I need to use the computer of my neighbour ?
[17:51:14] <Tach> biberu as I can't unzip them there ?
[17:51:15] <__adrian> and others can follow the same solutions. use decent hosts, use ftp/scp/whatever. this is not a real problem - it's long-solved.
[17:51:50] <Tach> __adrian it are ways... won't call them solutions myself
[17:51:52] <biberu> Tach: if you're using ci/cd you can probably automate it from there, and to speed it up deploy e.g. compressed artifacts
[17:52:24] <Tach> biberu yes for me that is possible but for someone whois having some other php project or even a WP site maybe not
[17:52:50] <__adrian> k. let's slow down, here. if this is just research, then you don't have a question. if/when you do have a question, you may pose it and folks here may answer. if you agree with their answers, you may follow the advice, and if you don't then you don't have to.
[17:52:54] <__adrian> follow?
[17:53:22] <biberu> Tach: it's not an issue you're having then?
[17:54:13] <Tach> __adrian it's research on facts I see with (PHP)developers and try to think this over...

[20:34:22] <mawk> when I use 'namespace' in a file, and declare some stuff, can I go back to the previous namespace afterwards? or does it need to be in a different file
[20:34:59] <__adrian> namespaces are per-file
[20:35:14] *** ChanServ sets mode: -o __adrian
[20:40:10] <AllenJB> It's technically possible to define multiple namespaces in one file, but I've never seen it done outside of sandbox examples (eg. on https://3v4l.org where there is no "multiple files")
[20:40:11] <AllenJB> https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.namespaces.definitionmultiple.php
[20:40:15] <__adrian> if you mean you want to have multiple namespaces in one file, you can do that with the {} syntax, but there's generally no good reason for it. define only one thing per file
[20:41:01] <__adrian> "never seen it done outside of sandbox examples"  afaik the reason it exists is to accommodate certain code generation tools
[20:41:02] <mawk> so { namespace stuff; /* ... */ } ? I thought I tried it and it failed
[20:41:14] <__adrian> your { is in the wrong place
[20:41:22] <AllenJB> You also put your life at risk from the next developer who's trying to read your code. Stick to well known (PSR-4) semantics for file / namespace organization
[20:41:25] <mawk> ah yes I see
[20:41:31] <mawk> thanks
[20:41:34] <__adrian> but again, this is generally a poor approach to organizing your code
[20:41:45] <__adrian> welcome
[20:41:55] <mawk> I'm doing a quick script that needs to mock some class inside a namespace, so I wanted to write that class and then go back to the root namespace
[20:42:11] <mawk> it could deserve its own file, but then my script wouldn't be self-contained in a single file anymore
[20:42:17] <__adrian> put the class in its own file
[20:42:40] <__adrian> is there a strong reason for your script to be contained in a single file?
[20:43:00] <mawk> because it's very short
[20:43:26] <__adrian> up to you. i wouldn't call that a "strong" reason  :)
[20:43:31] <mawk> it's basically just: echo json_encode(require($argv[1]), JSON_FORCE_OBJECT | JSON_PRETTY_PRINT | JSON_UNESCAPED_UNICODE)) . PHP_EOL;
[20:43:53] <mawk> so it's directly located in /usr/local/bin, to make it two files would require to make a lib directory for it somewhere
[20:44:38] <__adrian> well you're already requiring one other...? also not sure what you expect that to do. is the require'd file meant to return a value?
[20:44:48] <da_wunder> so do you really need namespace in that file then?
[20:44:48] <__adrian> seems like you'd want to do more validation on it if so
[20:46:10] <mawk> I require a php file passed as a command line argument __adrian
[20:46:30] <__adrian> yes, i follow
[20:46:42] <mawk> which contains translation data, in the form of <?php return ["string1 = > "translation1", ...] ?>
[20:46:44] <__adrian> but that code looks like you expect the file to `return` a value.
[20:46:49] <mawk> yeah
[20:47:03] <__adrian> k. so if that's the case, i'd expect you'd want more validationn in place around it
[20:47:18] <__adrian> e.g., inspect the returned value and make sure it's json-able
[20:47:28] <mawk> yeah I suppose if I want to push that code to some repository I need to make it proper
[20:47:37] <mawk> I don't really know much php at all but I guess I can do that yes
[20:48:48] <mawk> da_wunder: yes I use namespace to mock a class that is "use"'d by one of the files I import
[20:49:37] <mawk> to check if it's json-able I check the json_last_error() you mean __adrian ? or I check beforehnad
[20:49:49] <mawk> or I can make JSON_THROW_ON_ERROR and catch it
[20:50:48] <__adrian> mawk: you can (i always recommend JSON_THROW_ON_ERROR) but what i meant was to validate that it's an array, and possibly make sure it looks like you expect (in terms of schema)

[20:54:06] <mawk> ah yeah
[20:54:41] <__adrian> e.g., require returns 1 on success if the file doesn't return a value
[20:54:55] <__adrian> which IS json-encodable but most likely not what you expect

[21:07:29] <Viper-7> nitrospectide: the biggest advice i have would be to not mutate (change) $gen_events as you walk over it. doing that behind the scenes will create a duplicate of the array to work from - it would be cleaner both for the engine, and in your code, if you just created a new array for the output elements - and just appended the entries to it as you find them

[21:34:24] <Viper-7> just yet another change for the sake of breaking code compatibility - it doesnt actually save many/any keystrokes, we autocomplete the keyword or such anyway, it makes code more terse and less readable which is already an issue in PHP, ...
[21:34:28] <Viper-7> you know, the usual pragmatic stuff :P
[21:35:27] <cslcm> is there any way to use php in a more monolithic fashion like node, where there's a constant state and it's not respawning everything on every request?
[21:35:41] <Viper-7> if fn() was part of the patch that introduced proper closures, i'd be fine with ti
[21:35:45] <Viper-7> but it missed the boat, so no.
[21:35:49] <da_wunder> imho fn syntax won't make code less readable
[21:36:09] <da_wunder> + it solves use "issue"

[21:38:26] <Viper-7> PHP was designed around the HTTP request model, it really doesnt shine outside of that context
[21:41:47] <olle> Viper-7: fn() captures scope
[21:41:49] <Viper-7> cslcm: you can certainly have the bulk of the logic stay in PHP - and have whatever external tasks use a HTTP based API provided by PHP
[21:42:12] <cslcm> in my opinion that's a hinderance rather than a benefit these days, but one thing PHP has which outshines anything else is the massive API, community and extension library

[22:53:09] <varrg> Is it sane to skip one level in a namespace chain? that is, not have it exist. Example: abstract class Scheme {} namespace Scheme\Rename {} namespace Scheme\Validate {}
[22:54:38] <__adrian> what are you skipping?
[22:54:43] <varrg> namespace Scheme,
[22:55:07] <__adrian> are there any files in that namespace?
[22:55:17] <varrg> the namespace is never defined
[22:55:31] <__adrian> sur eit is,  namespace Scheme\Rename  ← in there
[22:55:47] <varrg> yes
[22:55:54] <varrg> so, it's not weird?
[22:55:57] <__adrian> but if there are no files at that particular level, then you'd never write it anywhere
[22:56:03] <__adrian> no
[22:56:25] <__adrian> though i would probably make it  namespace Scheme; abstract class Scheme {}
[22:56:35] <__adrian> (wrt this specific example)
[22:57:13] <__adrian> i've worked on many projects where  the base class/interface is not actually contained in the folder it's named after, and this is always a pain in the butt
[22:57:21] <varrg> okay, I got some obscurities from naming a class the same as a namespace before, not by doing it exactly like your example though
[22:57:50] <__adrian> well it's not the same name. ns is Scheme, and class is Scheme\Scheme
[22:58:15] <varrg> indeed. I had the class in the global namespace and had troubles importing and such
[22:58:31] <varrg> class Scheme; namespace Scheme {}
[23:01:28] <varrg> I need various Rename and Validates as well, each with a base class as well. So the following classes: Scheme\Scheme, Scheme\Validate\Validate, Scheme\Rename\Rename, Scheme\Rename\Sanitize, Scheme\Validate\Mimetype ?
[23:03:22] <__adrian> probably
[23:03:37] <__adrian> aside: things named "Sanitize" are usually doing bad ideas
[23:04:25] <varrg> mine replaces or removes characters from filenames
[23:04:34] <cslcm> not as bad as things named Satanize
[23:04:59] <varrg> although security is done by a validate scheme, which straight up invalidates filenames containing certain characters
[23:05:44] <__adrian> varrg: that sounds questionable to me. if something is not valid, it should be rejected outright, not fiddled with to try and make it "safe."
[23:05:53] *** Joins: magla (~gelignite@55d4275f.access.ecotel.net)
[23:06:25] <varrg> yeah, the sanitizing is more about making filenames pretty
[23:06:50] <__adrian> there's still the UX concern over asking for one thing and being given another unexpectedly

[23:38:25] <__adrian> i live be "don't let users touch your filesystem"
[23:38:46] <varrg> so, rename all files by default?
[23:38:47] <__adrian> *by
[23:39:06] <__adrian> if you want the users to choose a "filename," put it in the database
[23:39:13] <__adrian> the actual file? YOU name it.
[23:39:20] <varrg> makes sense
[23:39:21] <biberu> varrg: just saying this because that sanitation may need context to operate properly, even it's just for rejecting garbage, yes, users shouldn't be allowed to choose names
[23:39:26] <__adrian> ^
