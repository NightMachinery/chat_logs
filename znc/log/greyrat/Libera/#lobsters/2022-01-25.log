[08:20:19] <bones> Anyone here?
[08:21:05] <defect> not much activity right now to be honest
[08:21:14] <defect> been pretty quiet for the last couple of hours
[08:24:15] <bones> Gotcha. I just discovered lobste.rs and followed the breadcrumbs here to inquire about an account. Have any advice? :)
[08:24:15] *** Joins: drewnix (~textual@c-73-118-230-129.hsd1.wa.comcast.net)
[08:25:52] <defect> oh, i think the usual advice is to drop some links (github, SO, linkedin maybe) to onlince presence to make sure you're not a spammer
[08:26:05] <defect> though since it's pretty quiet right now might not be the best time
[08:27:13] <bones> Wouldn't this be doxing myself?
[08:27:33] <bones> Pardon the ignorance. I'm ruined by reddit
[08:29:06] <rtpg> Most (not everyone) on lobsters openly associate their identity to their account, or otherwise are publicly doing work under their pseudonym or have other "proof of work" that they are a serious person
[08:30:10] <rtpg> or like... mention what they want to comment about, links they are interested in submitting, some indicator that they are wanting to participate in the community as it exists (And not to do content marketing, I guess)
[08:31:14] <vladimyr> How did you land on lobster.rs?
[08:31:23] <bones> Gotcha. I suppose I have no need for anonymity then.
[08:31:23] <bones> I was a Microsoft MVP for 8 years and have a blog collecting dust here
[08:31:23] <bones> https://mikecrowley.us/. LinkedIn etc are linked from the site
[08:31:24] <mockturtle> [ Mike Crowley’s Whiteboard ] - mikecrowley.us
[08:31:48] <pe> bones: doxing yourself can be considered a countermeasure to ruining.
[08:32:18] <bones> Someone mentioned lemmy which mentioned this. I read a few articles and wanted to sign up
[08:33:02] * pe ponders whether being an MVP already identifies a ruined person
[08:33:10] <bones> Lol
[08:33:49] <rtpg> message me your email address and I can send you an invite
[08:34:08] <vladimyr> From lemmy to lobsters, that's certainly an interesting trajectory :)
[08:35:02] <defect> what is lemmy? i only know of the dude from motorhead
[08:35:18] <bparker> lemmy.ml
[08:35:21] <vladimyr> Federated Reddit basically
[08:35:29] <bones> Lemmy seemed interesting but fragmented

[14:44:14] <wink> nah, integers aren't really natural either

[14:46:22] <pe> wink: you can fix that...
[14:47:23] <pe> Talk about a crippling OCD.
[14:49:42] <kline> rust:
[14:49:45] <kline> Overflow behavior
[14:49:45] <kline> The absolute value of i64::MIN cannot be represented as an i64, and attempting to calculate it will cause an overflow. This means that code in debug mode will trigger a panic on this case and optimized code will return i64::MIN without a panic.
[14:50:31] <pe> Is that better or worse?
[14:50:40] <kline> all things considered, im surprised for any signed integer that .abs() doesnt return a unsigned of the same width
[14:50:47] <kline> which is guaranteed to hold it
[14:51:03] <kline> pe, it better, marginally, but only because you know which toe youre going to blow off
[14:51:09] <kline> whereas in C is could be any of them
[14:51:15] <kline> you're still without a toe though
[14:51:24] <pe> Wow, you're right, didn't occur to me.
[14:51:55] <pe> That the result may just be unsigned.
[14:52:29] <kline> seems like a semantics slam dunk, im disappointed that that opportunity was missed tbh
[14:53:00] <iDrougge> pe: I find the Rust behaviour of panicking in debug but silently returning nonsense in production is evil. It is specified instead of UB, but still evil.
[14:53:08] <kline> look at abs_diff() 1 down on that same page
[14:53:15] <kline> "This function always returns the correct answer without overflow or panics by returning an unsigned integer."

[18:18:55] <gwozniak> I've heard of both and I don't know what the difference is
[18:21:40] <rb> subnormals are very tiny values
[18:21:51] <companion_cube> I think you lose some precision guarantees, because they're so small
[18:21:55] <gwozniak> that much I remember
[18:22:01] <companion_cube> btw this site is really nice: https://float.exposed/
[18:22:02] <mockturtle> [ Float Exposed ] - float.exposed
[18:22:04] <rb> denormals i think has something to do with the leading 1 or 0
[18:24:14] <gwozniak> right, I think what it does is ignore the exponent so that there is actually more in the fractional/matissa part
[18:24:40] <companion_cube> like when the exponent is all ones? gosh it's so complicated
[18:24:53] <gwozniak> When the exponent is all zeros, I think
[18:24:55] <companion_cube> I've become more reasonable and accepted that floats are useful
[18:25:01] <companion_cube> but I think they shouldn't be as _common_
[18:25:10] <companion_cube> really a specialized type
[18:25:14] <gwozniak> Yeah
[18:25:31] <gwozniak> They should really be considered a complicated data structure that is very compact
[18:25:47] <gwozniak> And not thought of as "just a number" like integers
[18:26:07] <gwozniak> The hardware engineers are really bad for this, apparently
[18:26:36] <companion_cube> even fixed-width integers are, well, not just numbers
[18:26:58] <companion_cube> I think scheme (for example) does it right
[18:27:10] <companion_cube> the default should be bigints, with a nice compact representation for small integers
[18:27:18] <companion_cube> and the ability to use modular integers when needed
[18:27:43] <gwozniak> Yes, I really liked the numbers in CL, Scheme and friends
[18:28:05] <companion_cube> (fwiw Haskell does this too, although idk if they do the tagged pointer trick for Integer)
[18:28:38] <gwozniak> Something like "hardware int" should be a type that you can use, knowing that it comes with potentially many caveats

[22:27:29] <gwozniak> gerikson: parsing a string like "09" does not produce what was intended, that's for sure :)
[22:28:02] <iDrougge> gwozniak: It is converted as if it was an integer literal?
[22:28:12] <varjag> octal?

[22:30:38] <iDrougge> gwozniak: I was referring both to the octal notation and the fact that the function cannot signal failure and the fact that the "base" argument is not always a base.
[22:31:59] <iDrougge> In fact, leading 0 for octal is reason enough to qualify any language as a clown language.

[23:56:01] <ngoldbaum> iDrougge: explicit is better than implicit i guess?
