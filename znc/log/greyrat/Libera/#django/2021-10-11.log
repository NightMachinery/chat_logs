[00:22:10] <wallbroken> a simple question: IMAGE files of the database are stored directly in it?
[00:22:23] <wallbroken> or there are links to physical files?
[00:27:10] <poli> wallbroken: The migrations manage.py complains about do not exist anywhere, including in the package repository. Makemigrations tells me some migrations should be geenrated, but it generates none.
[00:27:20] <poli> So neither in the database not in the files.
[00:27:24] <poli> *nor
[00:28:50] <poli> So that's a extra weird problem of migrate and makemigrations telling me that an external app should have migrations that it does not. But this external app has no new versions in the past year, and I only noticed this message yesterday, almost one month after the same version of django-allauth is in the project.

[00:45:05] <poli> wallbroken: I don't think I got your question right. All other migrations that are from internal apps generated with makemigrations work. And all migrtions from external apps used to work. Now I got a new externa app into INSTALLED_APPS that needed migrate and I tried to migrate and those three apps plus the new one resulted in failed migrations. I reverted the insertion of this new app and realised that
[00:45:11] <poli> allauth was generating these erros before.
[00:46:22] <poli> I have updated some dependencies in the meanwhile, including django to 3.2.8 (from 3.2.7).
[00:46:35] <poli> All dependencies are in their lastest version.
[00:47:57] <poli> Hmm on a second though maybe django-allauth does not support django 3.2.8 yet. Lets try to roll back on django and see.

[09:03:57] <PaulWay[w]> Python question: is there any way to modify or add a key in a dict returned from a function while in the middle of an iterator?
[09:04:30] <PaulWay[w]> So e.g. I have events = [new_event_struct(report) for report in new_reports]
[09:05:19] <PaulWay[w]> Where new_event_struct does a straight return of a dict.
[09:06:01] <PaulWay[w]> But for say updated report events I want the event struct to also set 'existing': True.
[09:06:36] <PaulWay[w]> But I don't think I can do `events = [new_event_struct(existing_report)['existing'] = True for existing_report in existing_reports]` can I.

[09:16:35] <PaulWay[w]> It's a syntax error.
[09:17:00] <dre> try new_event_struct(existing_report).update({'existing':True})
[09:17:12] <PaulWay[w]> Interesting!
[09:17:13] <dre> probably can't assign with the '='
[09:17:16] <PaulWay[w]> Yep.
[09:18:19] <PaulWay[w]> I solved it by having new_event_struct use a temporary variable for the dict and take an optional parameter
[09:18:25] <PaulWay[w]> Which is probably a nicer solution.
[09:19:53] <dre> PaulWay[w], ah yeah, better.
[09:20:01] <dre> dict.update() doesn't return the list
[09:20:08] <dre> so you'd just get a list of None's in my case.
[09:22:32] <PaulWay[w]> Yeah, there's probably some 'expression vs instruction' semantics here.

[13:22:21] <carloratm> Is it possible (useful?) to default an ImageField to a staticfile?
[13:22:43] <carloratm> I'd like to keep it in the repo so that can be shared among devs
[13:22:59] <serafeim> carloratm: i don't think that's even possible
[13:24:25] <GinFuyou> media shouldn't be static, yeah
[13:24:33] <carloratm> ok, fair enough
[13:24:40] <GinFuyou> Can't you just default it on rendering?

[13:26:01] <carloratm> that could work, actually. Thank you
[13:26:36] <GinFuyou> Adding a default media should be possible with some work, but not from static perhaps. At least copy static to media or something

[13:53:37] <pycode1> the model has a field called "selected"
[13:53:53] <pycode1> basically i have to add a validation run to check if one (at least) has been selected or not
[13:54:01] <pycode1> is that possible to loop over the formset to check that ?
[13:54:29] <pycode1> ithink it is a custom validation rule bcause the form is ok the "selected" field could be blank/null, it is not a problem

[14:27:54] <GinFuyou> anyway it should work one way if not other
[14:28:27] <serafeim> in such cases i just add a breakpoint on forms_valid (or form_valid) and check to see what works
[14:28:34] <pycode1> no no wait

[14:30:13] <pycode1> https://bpa.st/F3LA
[14:31:11] <pycode1> whats happening? why do i have to call cleaned_dta

[14:40:54] <pycode1> i think i  did not noticed it before because is_valid is implicit and it is calling the clean() itself
[14:41:17] <moldy> pycode1: IIRC you're not allowed to access .cleaned_data before having called .is_valid
[14:41:21] <moldy> the form docs have details
[14:41:47] <pycode1> moldy, exactly i think that's the problem
[14:42:05] <pycode1> moldy, one thing...if we override the clean()
[14:42:09] <pycode1> should we return something?
[14:42:23] <moldy> pycode1: did you check what the docs say about this? ;)
[14:42:47] <pycode1> moldy, i am reading the example here: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/forms/validation/#validating-fields-with-clean
[14:42:50] <pycode1> but i do not see any return
[14:43:19] <moldy> https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/forms/validation/
[14:43:48] <moldy> This method can return a completely different dictionary if it wishes, which will be used as the cleaned_data.
[14:44:06] <moldy> so, it seems you can return the new cleaned data, but you don't have to
[14:44:43] <pycode1> ok ok
[14:44:44] <pycode1> thanks
[14:45:06] <pycode1> howver it is correct what you said, is_valid() must be called first...and then i can work with cleanded_data
[14:45:07] <pycode1> thanks!!
[14:45:25] <moldy> i recommend carefully reading that document so you understand the whole logic flow in form validation

[23:34:46] <daniel2> dodo: So sorry ended up going to bed and didn't see your response.  So I have a model, and another model that tracks stats for the first model.  So I want to be able to sort the first model by the stats on the second model, but the 2nd model has multiple rows of stats, so I need to use the latest one.
