[01:12:19] <rpav> i sortof can't stand classic-BG-style CRPGs in general for that in general .. they have none of the clever writing of Ron Gilbert etc games nor any of the depth of gameplay of better RPGs
[01:12:20] <grym> rudybot: i don't want his pants, i just want to see if i can steal 'em
[01:12:41] <technomancy> the kid did play thru both the SNES and Genesis Shadowrun games, which seemed a lot more interesting
[01:12:49] <aidalgol> rpav: Yeah, and it seems that's what people want in a fantasy CRPG.
[01:12:52] <technomancy> as far as tabletop ports go
[01:12:54] <rudybot> grym: well let's see how that stupid double behaves when I steal its pants
[01:13:06] <aidalgol> So it's either that or you get a shallow action RPG.

[01:13:36] <rpav> aidalgol: dunno ... there are a lot of other fantasy RPGs that are a lot better imo, but i tend to think more JRPG stuff i guess
[01:13:37] <technomancy> rpav: have you played Planescape Torment tho?
[01:13:44] <technomancy> same engine but actually interesting writing
[01:13:48] <rpav> technomancy: i started and didn't get very far
[01:13:50] <aidalgol> rpav: JRPGs have their own tired tropes.
[01:14:11] <rpav> these days if i want a good story i'll read a book; if i want to play something i want good gameplay
[01:14:20] <aidalgol> PT really feels like they wanted to make a point-and-click adventure game, but used a D&D CRPG engine.
[01:14:29] <rpav> good gameplay plus a good story is great, but if video game writers were any good they'd be writing books
[01:14:34] <technomancy> aidalgol: yeah the UI is definitely clunky
[01:14:52] <aidalgol> technomancy: I was thinking more how the RPG mechanics feel like they get in the way than the UI.
[01:15:06] <aidalgol> rpav: Some writers like more experimental mediums.
[01:15:11] <rpav> aidalgol: they do definitely, lots of anime cliche stuff but there are some gems
[01:15:19] <rpav> if you never played Lost Odyssey
[01:15:21] <aidalgol> I think, "If you were good, you'd be writing books," is rather elitist.
[01:15:45] <artefact> you've never read bad fan fiction i guess :P
[01:15:47] <rpav> high recommend .. or Tales of Vesperia, while anime-trope-ish in some regards still the best in the series with some good writing, and all the tales games are very non-western-fantasy
[01:15:53] <aidalgol> They're just different forms of storytelling.
[01:16:00] <rpav> aidalgol: hypothetically yes, but in practice, no
[01:16:11] <rpav> well
[01:16:37] <artefact> i recommend valkyrie profile, i loved both the story and the gameplay
[01:16:54] <rpav> like people point at various games "for the story" and they're generally indicating games with bad/ripoff stories and looking in the wrong places
[01:17:14] <artefact> too bad is almost impossible to play to the good ending without a guide
[01:17:15] <rpav> look at like, old point'n'click adventures and yes absolutely
[01:17:45] <rpav> you can't really _do_ things like Monkey Island any other way
[01:18:02] <aidalgol> The games I've played with interesting stories have mostly not been point-and-click adventure games.
[01:18:13] <rpav> but "game where you read a lot then have to do some work to continue" is the bigger trend and none of those are that good .. e.g. anything from Bioware

[01:24:45] <rpav> sierra games were a lot more dubious, but i definitely enjoyed like Space Quest at some point
[01:24:46] <aidalgol> They all feel like the story stops for you to solve some puzzles, then you get a bit more exposition, then the cycle repeats.
[01:24:56] <grym> "ohhh you forgot to click on the third pigeon from the left in the second opening scene; no maximally happy ending for you!"
[01:24:59] <rpav> but finding every funny way you could die or whatever
[01:25:29] <aidalgol> grym: And the games always felt so smug about all the ways they screwed you over.
[01:25:39] <rpav> but better is something like Doom; it had a .. err story, but it was mostly you experiencing the game, and the gameplay being good, and the level design being good
[01:25:53] <technomancy> I enjoyed space quest because I was nine and there was nothing else to do
[01:26:19] <nucranium> having nothing else to do is an over looked factor
[01:26:19] <aidalgol> Doom has nothing more than an excuse plot, which is fine for what it is, but it's not a game you play for storytelling.
[01:26:41] <rpav> but my point is that, at the end of the day, the best authors in the world write books you merely have to dedicate time to reading, they do not demand you _do work_ to _earn the right to continue reading_ between chapters
[01:26:44] <nucranium> otoh, its not like we have "better" things to do now, we just have this baseline of ambient entertainment
[01:26:54] <rpav> so if a less-good video game story doesn't have good gameplay, then it's just not worth playing
[01:27:09] <aidalgol> I still maintain that's an elitist view.

[01:50:37] <rpav> it's part of the reason games develop little in plot or game design departments these days; it's easier and cheaper to hack out quick cliches than develop a deep theory and philosophy of gaming

[01:57:33] <parsnip> > During the evolution of Therapsida, there was a period during which mammals were so small and short-lived that wear on the teeth yielded no significant selection pressure to constantly replace them.

[01:58:01] <rpav> nucranium: and yeah .. the problem is games are crazy amounts of work and very little of that is programming or writing

[05:27:40] <grym> dale: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFOfSlDCwYw  stay a while, and listen
[05:27:47] <grym> technomancy: clicky clicky goblin loot go brrr
[05:27:47] <JordiGH> All of the hype material for Sonic 2 movie is looking perfect. Just hope the movie is as good as the hype.
[05:28:54] <technomancy> JordiGH: guess it's meant for someone other than me
[05:29:08] <dale> However, keep in mind that we have previously covered how unsophisticated, uncultured I am to not really care about stories in video games at all.
[05:29:40] <dale> The only exception for me that I can think of recently has been Horizon: Zero Dawn, which had a story I was actually kind of interested in.  The game play was even a bit tiring after a while, but I kept at it for the story.
[05:29:45] <technomancy> dale: Planescape Torment was the first game I played that really went out of its way to mess with your expectations and subvert tropes you take for granted
[05:30:12] <dale> technomancy: This is the kind of thing I would actually just look up a YouTube video with cutscenes for.  That was voiced, right?
[05:30:27] <technomancy> like it takes the RPG rule book and sets it on fire while cackling maniacally and throwing it out the window
[05:30:38] <dale> grym: I remember falling asleep near my desk and leaving this playing in the background.
[05:31:04] <technomancy> dale: not 100% voiced but a good chunk of it?
[05:31:16] <grym> after a while i convinced myself that there's a shared snippet of melody between tristram town music and a blind guardian song
[05:31:45] <dale> I thought I liked the story of Metal Gear Solid V, but it turns out I more like the *feel* of MGSV.  The story is as insane as everyone promised.
[05:32:32] <technomancy> weirdly similar to undertale in that way
[05:32:42] <aidalgol> Hardly any lines in Planescape: Torment are voiced.
[05:32:51] <dale> technomancy: Undertale story has a great vibe but story doesn't necessarily make sense?
[05:32:59] <dale> I played probably two hours of Undertale before I put it down.
[05:33:05] <technomancy> aidalgol: hm; ok it's been a good while now
[05:33:12] <dale> aidalgol: Oh, bummer.  I remember it having tons of text.
[05:33:32] <aidalgol> Undertale's fanbase put me off playing Undertale. :(
[05:33:47] <dale> The more I think about this, I actually have liked many video game stories, but it seems that I'm often interested in the game play, or in the story, but rarely both.

[05:34:41] <dale> Like, I've read a bunch about the story in the System Shock games, and the Bioshock games, which are both interesting, but the game play didn't do much for me.  I probably put at least ten hours in SS2 but it seemed kind of boring as an FPS/RPG hybrid.
[05:34:52] <aidalgol> One of the things that I enjoy about story-driven games is environmental storytelling, which you can't do in most other mediums.
[05:35:04] <technomancy> the UI of the original system shock is *rough*
[05:35:24] <technomancy> it's like trying to play an FPS that's also an emacs mode
[05:35:29] <technomancy> but not in a good way
[05:35:38] <aidalgol> IMO, Bioshock has an interesting premise, but is very thin on actual plot.
[05:35:48] <aidalgol> technomancy: There's a good way?
[05:35:53] <technomancy> bioshock spends a lot of time letting you shoot libertarians tho
[05:35:59] <dale> technomancy: Yeah, I never even bothered with System Shock.  System Shock 2 seemed passable, it just got very long for my tastes.

[05:37:25] <aidalgol> Anyway, it's not as satisfying when the libertarians are bullet sponges.
[05:37:30] <dale> Halo seemed like it might have an interesting story, and it kind of pointed in that direction, but after reading some summaries I was left feeling like its various "plot" parts were mostly done elsewhere in sci-fi literature, and mostly better.

[05:37:49] <twb> dale: Halo is just Marathon 4
[05:37:52] <dale> And Halo the gameplay is... not for me, at least not anymore.
[05:38:10] <dale> twb: Story-wise as well?  I never looked up Marathon's story.  Never had a Mac at the right time to even play it.
[05:38:26] <twb> dale: you can play it right now for free on Debian
[05:38:26] <aidalgol> dale: IMO, Halo's plot is just derivative of space operas novels, and yeah, the gameplay is incredibly dull.
[05:38:46] <aidalgol> And all increasing the difficulty does is makes enemies take more hits, so it goes from dull, to dull with bullet sponges.
[05:38:50] <twb> I mean obviously Halo is mainly "What if ringworld was also a death star"
[05:39:10] <dale> aidalgol: I kind of can't figure out why it's so popular.  I wonder if it's just a combination of nostalgia for console people who had Halo has their first FPS, and then uh... I guess people who only ever owned an Xbox?
[05:39:18] <technomancy> the first marathon's story is super cliche but the sequels are solid
[05:39:46] <twb> THe reason halo was popular is because it PIONEERED moving FPS from PC to console
[05:39:47] <aidalgol> dale: It's that and Microsoft's marketing budget.
[05:39:47] <technomancy> I think in halo they were going to put a story in and then they realized they were selling it to illiterate frat boys and decided not to bother
[05:39:49] <dale> twb: Hey, that's cool, I didn't realize they open sourced it.
[05:39:56] <twb> e.g. they invented the concept of auto-aim
[05:40:14] <twb> e.g. you can't type 1 through 0 for weapons, so they made it so you only carry two weapons
[05:40:18] <aidalgol> technomancy: I think the target demographic was a bit younger than frat boys.
[05:40:34] <dale> aidalgol: One of my cousins apparently played the Halo theme on violin for a Microsoft conference or something like that.  They do have pretty high production values on that PR.
[05:40:36] <twb> technomancy: right -- originally halo was going to be on mac and was kinda different
[05:40:46] <technomancy> aidalgol: ah, well it came out when I was a freshman so that's the impression I got
[05:40:54] <twb> technomancy: then MS was like "guess what mofos we own you"
[05:41:23] <technomancy> but also they were like "shit; CRT TVs don't have the fidelity to display text so I guess the whole 'having a story' thing is right out"
[05:41:28] <dale> lol
[05:41:31] <aidalgol> technomancy: I was like 12, and every kid I knew with an Xbox had a massive hardon for it.
[05:41:51] <dale> Halo had vehicles!!  Ground breaking.
[05:41:55] <aidalgol> twb: Yeah, why the hell did a Mac-specific development shop sell out to Microsoft?
[05:41:58] <twb> technomancy: well they told the story through cutscenes instead of their existing tradition of "optional click-on-this-for-plot-dump" computer consoles
[05:42:10] <technomancy> aidalgol: https://p.hagelb.org/lone-starr.gif

[05:56:27] <drakonis> single player quake is also quite fun

[06:01:56] <twb> DF2/3/4 had crappy FMV cutscenes, but at least they tried to have a plot
[06:02:49] <JordiGH> Quake was like, uh, sure, plot, whatevs.
[06:03:05] <JordiGH> Cthulhu or something, look, you're here to shoot stuff, just do that.

[06:48:20] <drakonis> compiling, using steam, using any of the derivatives

[06:55:19] <twb> porn is illegal in japan but they have deeply selective enforcement.  So the late 90s was a "golden age" for porn games there
[06:55:42] <aidalgol> bizarre
[06:56:03] <twb> japan also has the death penalty but for liek 40 years they've just never got around to booking an execution
[06:56:17] <aidalgol> for porn?
[06:56:19] <twb> So there's dudes on death row there that are like "OK I'm proooobably going to live"

[06:56:46] <twb> Sketch: I don't recall exactly
[06:57:02] <aidalgol> JordiGH: There's also MonoGame, so not necessarily.
[06:57:05] <twb> Sketch: my memory is last time I looked, it was a lot stricter than you'd think
[06:57:06] <Sketch> hence most japanese porn being censored
[06:57:14] <JordiGH> Oh, XNA.
[06:57:45] <Sketch> (and the stuff that is uncensored is only officially sold outside of japan)

[07:07:54] <twb> do studios actually hire more than one developer

[07:08:58] <twb> technomancy: as a player, I have a blanket ban on RPG Maker :-)
[07:11:05] <e1f> odd that no one mentioned return to castle wolfenstein. it came after quake and the multi-player networked game was amazing. the server we joined was full of u.s. military and we knew us was going to invade (i forget if it was kuwait or iraq) before it was reported. they just said they were "shipping out" without breaking opsec
[07:12:20] <twb> e1f: I never played that one
[07:12:37] <twb> I played the reboot that came out a little after, around 2009
[07:12:46] <technomancy> from what I can tell AAA game studios make the silicon valley web startup scene look like kindergarten
[07:12:59] <technomancy> as far as the amount of misery they inflict on the people there
[07:13:01] <e1f> the single player rtcw campaign is excellent
[07:13:10] <e1f> basically every cool ww2 movie is represented
[07:13:14] <twb> yeah it looked OK.
[07:13:20] <twb> I haven't actually played more than 30 minutes or so of it
[07:13:36] <aidalgol> technomancy: The indies aren't innocent, either.
[07:13:39] <e1f> the reboot was just for $
[07:13:40] <twb> My backlog is about 1500 games deep, not counting the free ones
[07:13:58] <technomancy> aidalgol: yes but seems like there's a lot more variation there, whereas in AAA it's 100% misery 24/7
[07:14:17] <e1f> i hope you're keeping in mind the time the games were released when critiquing them
[07:14:17] <twb> technomancy: I agree

[07:14:51] <aidalgol> e1f: Were they *really*, though?
[07:14:57] <e1f> yes
[07:14:59] <aidalgol> Or just the first to make it big.
[07:15:00] <twb> e1f: well I played rage when that shipped and it was a heap of shit
[07:15:10] <aidalgol> Didn't Marathon release before Doom?
[07:15:17] <aidalgol> And Descent was before Quake.
[07:15:35] <twb> e1f: I played doom3 when it was re-released and it was extremely shit and their big selling point was like "dynamic lighting exists"

[07:20:40] <twb> ZP has a bunch of rants lately going "has anyone else noticed that AAA are toxic *and* crap, and all the good indie games look like they were made for PS1/gamecube"

[07:23:20] <aidalgol> There most definitely *is* a trend of so-called "analog horror" games, that intentionally look like a PS1 or Gamecube game.
[07:23:27] <twb> I've tried a few of the RE clones and I think it's like when people tell you Model M is the best keyboard
[07:23:31] <aidalgol> But they're mostly only popular among the die-hard horror fans, AFAICT.
[07:24:24] <twb> and I never had a gamecube and I tried the spyro remake and I'm like "this LOOKS good but the gameplay is just... boring"
[07:24:27] <aidalgol> Ubisoft was originally a French company, though.
[07:24:50] <twb> I so kind of enjoy watching someone ELSE play a RE clone though
[07:25:06] <aidalgol> twb: Yeah, when people say some genre peaked with some old PS1-era game, it's almost always old-man-yells-at-cloud.

[07:35:55] <aidalgol> Which is bullshit, because VAs haven't done mo-cap for their characters since *ever*.

[07:36:19] <aidalgol> I'm not even sure I agree that Steam has a (de facto) monopoly.
[07:36:34] <aidalgol> It's not the same landscape as with video hosting, which is insanely expensive.
[07:36:43] <twb> I assume its PC market share is like 80% and nobody else has more than 3%
[07:36:52] <twb> I'm rounding that to "monopoly"
[07:36:57] <aidalgol> Oh yeah, they definitely have the lion's share of the market.
[07:37:23] <aidalgol> But they don't have the same stranglehold on the medium.
[07:37:51] <aidalgol> It almost seems that the problem is more the fierce brand-loyalty of gamers.
[07:38:01] <twb> hmm?
[07:38:02] <aidalgol> At least more so in this industry than others.

[07:38:43] <bjc> if steam didn't enforce drm on their games, i would be more likely to agree. but (afaik) i can't just copy all my games out of my steam library, uninstall steam, and never look back

[07:38:57] <twb> bjc: granted

[07:40:58] <twb> I actually rented a laserdisc player once
[07:41:00] <aidalgol> bjc: In that case, I'm more annoyed at developers not selling anywhere but Steam than at Valve.

[16:48:09] <kensanata> I think it depends on your personal preferences and society around you: if you like your evenings to be light and your mornings to be dark and lonely vs. you like to rise early and see the sun and think the kids should be in bed when the sun goes down so you have a lot of time to yourself, or something like that. Anyway. Your preferences vs. society around you dictating your working hours.

[16:49:00] <parsnip> one is, the swing of hours is a bit more than an hour, so the hour is pointless
[16:49:18] <parsnip> second is, if you want more daylight after work, shift your work schedule

[16:50:03] <parsnip> in a sense, that's all that really happening. people are shifting their work schedule
[16:50:27] <kensanata> It sounds like your argument is "there is no perfect solution so stop messing around"?

[16:52:05] <parsnip> why is it weak?
[16:52:14] <parsnip> the numbers are arbitrary anyways
