[00:29:01] <lungaro> someone made a entire github org for go-ping, cause pinging requires a team of engineers apparently
[00:29:06] <lungaro> yeah, either icmp or udp
[00:29:12] <Sam> https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/net/icmp
[00:29:21] <lungaro> i should just read up more on it and write my own, this cant' be that hard
[00:29:30] <lungaro> -- said by every other dev trying to ping
[00:30:23] <Sam> x/net/icmp is a bit lower level than you might want if you really just want to send a ping, but should be fine

[01:10:51] <zsnes> so the builtin ping is already setuid and all that for the perms it needs running any new tool would require running it as root or setting it up to have the proper network privs

[01:21:18] <b0nn> I had thought that Go was too high in the stack to do anything meaningful in the networking space
[01:22:27] <ikke> how so?
[01:22:57] <b0nn> I mean, people have often come here looking for ways to read the ethernet frame that encapsulates a given ip packet, but that's stripped before Go gets the data

[01:23:25] <m33k> well you can do that with raw sockets, there are some go projects that use them
[01:23:30] <ikke> right
[01:23:55] <b0nn> hmm, can you point to any off the top (I'd like to have a look should the Q come up again)
[01:25:38] <m33k> b0nn: sure, this is one: https://github.com/oneNutW0nder/CatTails
[01:28:53] <lungaro> yeah the go-packet lib is amazing too
[01:28:55] <b0nn> Awesome, it looks like (at a glance) it's using unix.Bind and unix.Write (to a given file descriptor
[01:29:16] <Tv_> b0nn: Go is perfectly capable of doing networking at any level exposed to userspace
[01:30:05] <b0nn> And unix.Socket for creating the raw socket
[01:31:07] <Tv_> lungaro: no, ping is genuinely simple, until you care about reporting performance correctly or such, and historically anything calling itself ping has done that wrong anyway ;)  (if you want to emulate existing software, look at mtr not ping)
[01:31:08] <m33k> pretty much, yeah. it just calls the right APIs and then the network stack will just pass the whole packet up to userspace, bypassing the whole stack. this also bypasses iptables
[01:31:22] <m33k> you need to be root to do it for the most part though

[02:34:48] <foobaz> when i was an ISP network engineer, my routers had faster performance for TCP than ICMP, at least after the first packet
[02:35:32] <foobaz> because subsequent TCP packets matched an existing connection and skipped the firewall
[02:36:29] <foobaz> and the firewall was slow because it did packet shaping, rate limiting, and lots of other stuff
[02:38:34] <Tv_> foobaz: that's the common way around
[02:38:57] <Tv_> either tcp/udp is prioritized, or they're equal, but prioritizing icmp comes across as cheating

[10:04:16] <Cork> usr123: Handler is an interface so you can give it any struct that has the ServeHTTP function on it
[10:04:29] <Cork> HandlerFunc is one such struct
[10:04:29] <KirkMcDonald> So that you can pass a function to it directly, without needing an explicit conversion to HandlerFunc.
[10:04:47] <Cork> s/struct/type/
[10:06:01] <KirkMcDonald> usr123: Handler is an interface type. HandlerFunc is a func type that implements the Handler interface.
[10:07:06] <KirkMcDonald> usr123: In your playground there, shitFunc is a func type. It complains because, yes, a type is not an expresion.

[18:04:15] <A_Dragon> well, assuming you're SURE the source of your precision number is an int, or otherwise not directly user controled, you could use printf("%%%d.f", precision)
[18:05:31] <mickey> you sure %%%d.f is the right string though? %.2f would seem like %.%%df or something, no?

[18:06:51] <fizzie> You can use * for dynamic width/precision, just like with C's printf.

[21:57:51] <Tv_> but is not the right tool to parse standalone svg files
[21:58:07] <mrig> Yes I used that in one of the gopl book questions and it was pretty nice.
[21:58:38] <mrig> the svg is my hand written svg, would like to make a widget to make defining curves a little easier.
[21:59:18] <mrig> I think it would be perhaps best if I go for the xml and make my own parse tree, more room to expand then.
