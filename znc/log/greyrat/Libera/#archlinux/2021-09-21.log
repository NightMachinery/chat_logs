[13:17:36] <demonicm1niac> not necessarily bats if you use it during the day
[13:17:37] <raster> well i'll look into it in future. don't own my ouse - rent so no choice.
[13:17:40] <rabbitnightmare> I don't run batteries I sell power
[13:18:01] <demonicm1niac> you just need a switchover between your solar and grid power
[13:18:12] <demonicm1niac> you do have your constant consumers like fridge freezer etc

[13:18:29] <demonicm1niac> or you could use it to heat a water reservoir
[13:18:39] <rabbitnightmare> last 28 day cycle I made 8,298 USD
[13:18:53] <rabbitnightmare> for sitting on my ass thats nice
[13:18:59] <demonicm1niac> that depends very much on where you live and how it's handled whether that's worth it

[13:19:13] <raster> actually looking at buying a place... i put in an offer last night. the place needs renovation - the kind of work that means not living in it for a few months until it's finished. so maybe keep in mind adding panels to the roof later, though i plan to add a loft extension that will eat up the south-facing roof (dormer - so it'd go flat thus reducing area a bit)

[13:27:13] <raster> just rotate until panel is at the brightest
[13:27:26] <rabbitnightmare> problem is the earth rotates

[13:37:04] <rabbitnightmare> raster for personal use yes
[13:37:16] <raster> well that's all i can do as i can't sell :)

[18:13:49] <zpth0z> Hiya, I'm having trouble with GRUB. I tried to change the order of the boot menu so that Windows and Linux were switched. However, Windows showed as UEFI Firmware Settings in Grub Customizer. I didn't think much of it, and put it at the top. I rebooted and it put me into the motherboard settings. Now I'm worried I won't be able to get Windows back on there.

[23:30:27] <kib> idk but I'd prefer that tbh
[23:30:41] <GuiToris> Namarrgon, I'd like to use an older version of the package
[23:30:48] <Namarrgon> of which package?
[23:30:52] <GuiToris> Anki
[23:31:02] <Namarrgon> i'm talking about its dependencies
[23:31:04] <HenryTheLongshot> thurstylark: hmm, I guess I'll stick with dd if=/dev/urandom then
[23:31:07] *** Joins: Z00Z (~quassel@30.75.27.93.rev.sfr.net)
[23:31:08] <kib> actually python-mock exists
[23:31:19] <kib> python-decorator does too
[23:31:22] <GuiToris> Namarrgon, oh, then I misunderstood
[23:31:23] <kib> both in official repos
[23:31:29] <kib> use pacman not pip
[23:31:33] <thurstylark> if I'm reading correctly, shred just makes the dd from urandom method easier with options and defaults for destroying files instead of just general block copy operations
[23:31:35] <GuiToris> thank you!
[23:31:58] <Namarrgon> HenryTheLongshot: what is on that disk that it requires 'shredding'?
[23:32:16] <kib> I've to go now :(
[23:32:18] <HenryTheLongshot> Namarrgon: just my personal files, I'm giving the latop away to someone
[23:32:18] *** Quits: kib (~kib@user/kib) (Quit: WeeChat 3.2.1)
[23:32:52] <HenryTheLongshot> So I've cloned the disk, and now I'm destroying any of my data on it
[23:33:07] <thurstylark> a single pass should do the thing. 3 passes is gonna take a while depending on how big the disk is

[23:35:11] <HenryTheLongshot> thurstylark: yeah so 1 dd pass should be enough. It's a 250 gb SSD
[23:35:29] <Namarrgon> empty all keyslots and then wipefs the fs/partition signatures
[23:35:39] <Namarrgon> that's good enough and much faster
[23:36:09] <HenryTheLongshot> Namarrgon: Well, I've already started a dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sda so I'm just gonna let that run its course

[23:42:47] <GuiToris> it's funny that I'm using an older version of PKGBUILD to install an older version of Anki, but it always failed. It seems that this PKGBUILD never really worked
[23:44:06] <GuiToris> I'll keep adding dependencies, I guess that's what you would suggest anyway
[23:46:24] <Namarrgon> i would suggest building the current version in a clean chroot
