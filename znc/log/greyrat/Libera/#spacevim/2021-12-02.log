[20:14:19] <Helenah> Oh...
[20:14:20] <Helenah> okies
[20:15:16] <Helenah> Ders, greyrat_, In0perable, lilgopher, Is this channel actually active? Apparently Space l r isn't a bound key combo but the documentation says it should be and I want to run my code. lol
[21:36:38] <lilgopher> Helenah "active" is relative, haha. Sometimes people talk and respond but I suspect this is a channel connected to Discord or Slack or other similar third party software
[21:36:55] <Helenah> hmm
[21:37:32] <lilgopher> is any other combo working for you with the leading key(space)?
[21:38:13] <Helenah> I haven't tried any
