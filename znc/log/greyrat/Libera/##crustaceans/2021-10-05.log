[00:06:08] <gerikson> yeah, why would the shitty VR product *not* be affected by this
[00:18:06] <manicennui> Can I enter error messages in a VR environment and interact with them?!

[00:22:55] <manicennui> My last question brought Lawnmower Man to mind.
[00:23:10] <manicennui> I remember watching that, but I have no idea what it was about.
[00:23:38] <manicennui> Dr. Lawrence "Larry" Angelo works for Virtual Space Industries and runs experiments using psychoactive drugs and virtual reality to enhance cognitive performance, using chimpanzees as test subjects, in an experiment labeled "Project 5".
[00:23:44] <manicennui> Wow. They should definitely remake this.
[00:24:12] <manicennui> Angelo has benevolent aims, but VSI is funded by "The Shop," a clandestine group hoping to find out what use it has in War. One of the chimps, gifted with new intelligence, warfare training, and increased aggression, successfully escapes. Although tempted to abandon his work in frustration, Angelo later decides to recruit intellectually disabled greenskeeper Jobe Smith as a human test subject, telling the man he will become
[00:24:12] <manicennui> smarter.
[00:28:04] <manicennui> This sounds really wild, but the original story by Stephen King is completely unrelated, and sounds even wilder.
[00:28:23] <manicennui> And involves Pan.
[00:28:39] <manicennui> As in the Greek god.
[00:40:13] <dimadima> runs experiments using psychoactive drugs and virtual reality to enhance cognitive performance
[00:41:35] <dimadima> i don't see the point of experimenting on animals unless you're going to give them more asses
[00:43:51] <manicennui> Animals want drugs too.

[03:00:23] <gwozniak> manicennui: yeah, the Stephen King version of that story is so radically different than the movie it's not even worth saying it's based on the book in any way
[03:00:42] <gwozniak> I read it a while ago and I remember it being totally fucked up

[03:23:52] <gwozniak> Not a common occurrence, I take it?
[03:28:54] <indigo> Very rare :)
[03:31:30] <gwozniak> I only know LA climate through movies, so it's not trustworthy :)
[03:36:12] <indigo> It‚Äôs usually like it is in the movies. Super nice
[03:36:21] <indigo> Rarely raining
[03:40:42] <dimadima> LA/SD have mindblowingly amazing weather
[03:41:10] <dimadima> if you're into that kind of thing. i wonder if i would get tired of the consistency if i lived there
[03:41:22] <dimadima> i don't think i would
[03:46:05] <indigo> Sometimes you are sad that it doesn‚Äôt rain more
[03:46:23] <indigo> But mostly it‚Äôs just very nice not to have to look at the forecast before you go out
[03:46:34] <indigo> I want to move back to SD eventually
[03:48:19] <dimadima> for me it is also annoying having to put on clothes in the winter/fall/spring to go outside after a summer of not having to do that
[03:48:36] <dimadima> is my impression that weather in SD/LA more or less the same?
[03:48:48] <dimadima> i mean, is it correct?
[03:55:03] <indigo> dimadima: sometimes you‚Äôll need to put on a light jacket in the winter, otherwise it‚Äôs more or less the same

[06:09:45] <gwozniak> I rather liked it, but yeah, that ending
[06:09:48] <manicennui> Really good movie, but one of those movies you only need to watch once.
[06:10:37] <manicennui> gwozniak: I figured out what was going to happen with the bf half way through the movie and knew the ending was going to be fucked up.
[06:10:42] <manicennui> But I couldn't predict the actual ending.
[06:11:46] <gwozniak> The scene with Christopher Mintz-Plasse was pretty good, I thought
[06:11:53] <manicennui> heh
[06:11:56] <manicennui> Poor Mclovin.
[06:12:27] <manicennui> I think I was taken aback by the ending because it comes across like a dark comedy.
[06:12:31] <manicennui> But it's not at all funny?
[06:13:23] <manicennui> What a weird movie.
[06:13:24] <manicennui> I approve.
[06:13:30] <gwozniak> I think the "first ending" was necessary.  The actual ending was a bit odd but worked for me
[06:13:48] <gwozniak> And no, not really funny.  I did laugh a bit, mind you
[06:13:52] <gwozniak> Maybe it's just me

[19:07:06] <indigo> Jon Blow too; I think they're making languages with similar paradigms (C-like syntax, manual memory management)
[19:07:11] <jjuran> Does it have futures
[19:11:57] <deadk> ngoldbaum: is it pronounced like it's japanese
[19:15:59] <companion_cube> but Jon Blow's language has stuff like compile time evaluation iirc
[19:16:03] <companion_cube> my money is on Zig, anyway
[19:16:06] <companion_cube> literally
[19:16:44] <ngoldbaum> but zig isn‚Äôt written in rust

[19:29:02] <gwozniak> The Blow/hare languages are almost certainly doomed to obscurity because they don't acknowledge that most things are, in fact, very complicated

[19:40:25] <companion_cube> will it be open source? (but paying)

[20:55:17] <drakonis> his lang has a fatal flaw

[20:55:48] <drakonis> he hasnt set out to make a better C
[20:55:59] <drakonis> he set out to make a language for how he makes his games
[20:57:18] <manicennui> I don't think that is necessarily a bad thing.
[20:57:35] <manicennui> Just might find a limited audience.
[20:57:38] <manicennui> Which is fine.
[20:58:45] <drakonis> its the preaching that comes with it that is annoying
[20:58:59] <manicennui> Sure.
[20:59:00] <drakonis> all of the preaching
[21:02:59] <drakonis> then there's jblow's ignorance and disregard for other languages

[21:09:15] <drakonis> jblow has done several talks about how the programming world is collapsing
[21:24:33] <gwozniak> I'm listening to album called "wake up: get out of my fucking house".  The title and track names are probably the best thing about it.
[21:24:45] <gwozniak> Not terrible, though
[21:31:35] <drakonis> is jai public yet?
[21:37:20] <manicennui> drakonis: At least one of those talks was somewhat interesting, and not exactly about the stuff he normally talks about.
[21:37:25] <manicennui> Still had some questionable bits though.
[21:38:23] <drakonis> indeed.
[21:41:58] <manicennui> I honestly find him to be about as annoying as the average geek, but the cult that has formed around him helps spread his content, as well as everyone who wants to shit on him frankly.
[21:43:17] <manicennui> Is there any geek venue where he is even active?
[21:46:16] <manicennui> His HN comments are infrequent and he hasn't made one in months.
[21:47:30] <drakonis> twitter, raelly.
[21:47:32] <drakonis> really.
[21:47:47] <drakonis> he keeps deleting his older comments, so you cant read his history of incredibly horrible takes about nearly everything
[21:48:31] <companion_cube> someone must be documenting that, surely
[21:49:00] <drakonis> i remember some apocryphal story about keeping jonathan blow busy with random shit so they could finally finish the witness
[21:49:19] <manicennui> I just think horrible takes are par for the course for geeks, including most people here.
[21:49:35] <manicennui> But none of us are anywhere near as popular.

[21:50:34] <manicennui> I have also never randomly come across his tweets unless someone else is retweeting him to complain.
[21:50:49] <drakonis> that's basically it
[21:51:16] <drakonis> but jblow in a nutshell is pretty much complaining about shit that's really specific to him and then extrapolating it to be a global problem
[21:51:36] <drakonis> game dev specific problems that he presumes that everyone runs into
[21:53:52] <drakonis> there was a series of tweets he post shitting on linux that got rapidly dunked by ethan lee and ryan c gordon
[21:53:55] <drakonis> it was pretty great

[23:18:38] <buttsbot> Pussy Riot Is Releasing an NFT About Their Frequent Incarcerations | Observer
[23:18:54] <companion_cube> ‚Ä¶
[23:19:23] <dimadima> the construction "NFT about" is not one that would have occurred to me
[23:20:44] <manicennui> How much longer until the NFT fad ends?
[23:21:13] <dimadima> unpopular opinion, but: i don't think it'll end
[23:21:35] <manicennui> Very possible.
[23:22:43] <riv> surely people will realize it's stupid
[23:22:47] <manicennui> I just don't get it.
[23:23:38] <manicennui> It doesn't prevent copying of the thing, nor make sure that it is available in the future.
[23:23:40] <gwozniak> I wonder how many artists truly think it will protect their intellectual property vs. how many just want to try and cash in
[23:24:50] <manicennui> I support artists trying to get paid, but it's sad to see that they are now involved in technological scams.
[23:25:50] <dimadima> i know lots of non-tech ppl who trade in tokens. my impression is they like having these things to play with
[23:26:02] <dimadima> in as much as they like betting on sports or anything else
[23:26:14] <dimadima> the draw with tokens is they're high tech

[23:26:48] <buttsbot> Investors Spent Millions on 'Evolved Apes' NFTs. Then They Got Scammed - VICE
[23:27:02] <dimadima> gwozniak: the common misconception about tokens and ownership is the saddest thing to me
[23:27:05] <dimadima> about tokens
[23:27:45] <riv> i can understand why people pay $40,000 for a shiny charizard pokemon card
[23:27:52] <riv> but not this NFT garbage
[23:27:55] <manicennui> heh
[23:28:01] <manicennui> I can't tell whether you are being sarcastic.
[23:30:12] <skyl4rk> I can't even understand the collectible cards thing, I mean unless we're specifically taking obsessive traits into account, but perhaps that's a given
[23:30:52] * ngoldbaum doesn‚Äôt get funcopops either
[23:31:07] <ngoldbaum> although i think you can get funcopop figures that come with NFTs now?
[23:31:18] <manicennui> Most collectables like that have a brief window where you can make a lot of money by selling them.
[23:31:36] <riv> hmmm
[23:31:58] <manicennui> But it is generally hard to find someone who will actually pay their "value", and they often become almost worthless eventually as people move on to some other collectable.
[23:32:59] <ngoldbaum> https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58af7f412900002200bea8f8.jpeg
[23:33:14] <riv> that hurts so much
[23:33:25] <manicennui> riv: Your beanie babies are worth NOTHING!
[23:35:00] <dimadima> saw a classmate of mine trying to sell here beanies on FB yesterday
[23:35:11] <dimadima> i'm not on FB but a friend sent me a screen
[23:35:22] <dimadima> FB went back up and she posted them :/
[23:35:31] <manicennui> And now she is rich?
[23:35:39] <dimadima> yeah she's realizing all those gains finally
[23:35:58] <dimadima> she was putting them off for tax purposes but couldn't wait any longer
[23:35:59] <manicennui> And you feel silly for doubting her retirement planning strategy.
[23:36:18] <riv> what about my pogs?
[23:36:25] <dimadima> worthless, sorry
[23:36:47] * manicennui has some comics from the 90s that are taking up space.
[23:37:00] <dimadima> riv: honestly i always thought pogs were much cooler and way more fun
[23:37:06] <riv> they are cool
[23:37:11] <riv> love the random art
[23:37:12] <ngoldbaum> dimadima: just building beanie basis
[23:37:16] <manicennui> Garbage Pail Kids were the shit.
[23:37:40] <ngoldbaum> riv: pogs are definitely gonna have a nostalgia-fueled comeback
[23:37:43] <ngoldbaum> any day now
[23:37:53] <ngoldbaum> also yo-yos due for a revival
[23:37:59] <manicennui> My grandmother worked at a convenient store and brought us boxes of collectable cards that she got for cost or something. I had a complete set of Desert Storm cards.
[23:38:02] <dimadima> ngoldbaum: got to lobby congress to create beanie baby investment trusts

[23:38:18] <buttsbot> Desert Storm trading cards - Wikipedia
[23:38:22] <dimadima> i was googling that
[23:38:49] <ngoldbaum> dimadima: nancy pelosi is heavily invested in beanie babies so it‚Äôs inevitable really
[23:38:59] <ngoldbaum> the other freezer was for beanie babies
[23:39:00] <dimadima> manicennui: are those worth anything ?
[23:39:07] <manicennui> No idea.
[23:39:11] <manicennui> I don't have them anymore either.
[23:39:40] <dimadima> manicennui: far out. why you say "had"?
[23:39:42] <manicennui> Looks like you can get a set for cheap on ebay.
[23:39:48] <dimadima> ngoldbaum: lol
[23:40:01] <gwozniak> A family member recently came across a complete set of 1952-53 Parkhurst hockey cards in pretty good condition.  You could sell them for about $5000.  The guy who appraised them provided some pretty eye-opening info about the sports card market
[23:40:05] <manicennui> dimadima: In the 90s.
[23:40:20] <dimadima> so they're MIA now?
[23:40:48] <manicennui> I have almost nothing from when I was that age other than some comics.
[23:40:48] <dimadima> a friend's dad who grew up in the 50s-60s had many original comics and, as the story often goes, his parents threw them away
[23:40:52] <ngoldbaum> my understanding is that the pandemic drove a boom in the market for all kinds of collectibles
[23:40:58] <ngoldbaum> so many people bored indoors
[23:40:58] <gwozniak> The gist of his point was that there are way too many people with lots of money looking to one-up each other, so they spend tons of money on what is basically junk
[23:41:34] <gwozniak> ngoldbaum: yes, that is a big part of it
[23:41:59] <gwozniak> And they are spending their money on recent cards, hoping that the player will continue to do well
[23:42:04] <dimadima> before NFTs and stuff people just collected normal stuff https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1931745617

[23:42:12] <dimadima> that book is pretty dope
[23:42:26] <gwozniak> My cousin and I are thinking of buying that set because we just like it
[23:42:54] <dimadima> gwozniak: what set
[23:43:35] <gwozniak> dimadima: 1952-53 Parkhurst
[23:43:50] <ngoldbaum> some of the crap on the antiques roadshow is like that
[23:44:03] <ngoldbaum> where the price is completely disconnected from any kind of rational basis
[23:44:04] <dimadima> gwozniak: oh sorry i missed that somehow
[23:44:45] <dimadima> manicennui: i told my friend about desert storm cards and he's looking them up on ebay. some real gems

[23:45:10] <dimadima> can't think of desert storm and not the beginning of the big lebowski
[23:45:29] <manicennui> dimadima: They're both dead too!
[23:45:36] <ngoldbaum> this aggression will not stand, man
[23:46:08] <dimadima> only one died of natural causes
[23:46:14] <gwozniak> I hate fuckin' Eagles
[23:46:16] <manicennui> When I think of Desert Storm I think about watching tracer bullets through night vision goggles on CNN.
[23:46:23] <gwozniak> s/hate/hate the/
[23:46:42] <manicennui> Desert Storm was CNN's big break.
[23:46:48] <dimadima> how is it that zlibrary has everything https://1lib.us/book/5289307/30e3db
[23:46:49] <gwozniak> manicennui: I vividly remember the insanity that was cable news at the time
[23:46:51] <buttsbot> Z-Library single sign on
[23:46:57] <manicennui> And I was utterly fascinated by the video coming out of Iraq.
[23:47:10] <dimadima> in many ways cable news of the 80s and 90s was crazier than today

[23:47:55] <dimadima> ~ Mr anchor / Assure me / That baghdad is burning ~
[23:47:55] <ngoldbaum> the night in 2003 when we bombed baghdad and every news outlet on earth treated it like a fireworks display
[23:47:58] <skyl4rk> art prints on plastic bags, limited edition beer can netting, sell it the right way and we have solved the plastic pollution in the oceans
[23:48:11] <ngoldbaum> or at least in the US
[23:48:25] <dimadima> what a terrible night
[23:49:23] <skyl4rk> as you can seee when inspecting logo on the goodyear tire, there is an error from the molding process, a full set currently goes for $$$whatever
[23:50:48] <Brekkjern> I was honestly a bit too young to remember much about the Iraq war. I remember it happening and not really giving a shit. Not a surprise considering I was 12 and not from either the US or Iraq :P
[23:51:29] <manicennui> Brekkjern: Which one?

[23:53:57] <dimadima> yeh i remember that
[23:54:18] <dimadima> that's when i found out how pilots all take "go pills"
[23:54:34] <manicennui> It's unfortunate that we accomplish such amazing things in order to kill people.
[23:55:13] <dimadima> yeah truly amazing feat
[23:56:17] <Brekkjern> Just wait until we start lobbing railgun rounds across the planet...

[23:58:43] <Brekkjern> How is that series?
[23:58:56] <Brekkjern> I have it on my list, but haven't found the time/motivation to watch it :P
[23:58:56] <gwozniak> I'm liking it so far, after 5 episodes
[23:59:24] <gwozniak> It has some interesting takes on what might have been
