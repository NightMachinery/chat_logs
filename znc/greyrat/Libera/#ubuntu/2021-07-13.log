I've configured etc/default/grub and ran update-grub with no error but the system still boot with 5.8. If I try to uninstall 5.8 I get a warning that this action may crash the system. What can I do.

[10:09:25] <quadrat> you can use the mini.iso, but beware, you can only use that iso if you don't need any blobs for drivers, or uefi

[10:15:58] <morgans> yes, it has a usb port. it has ethernet too. why do you ask?
[10:16:15] <lotuspsychje> morgans: i was wondering why do you need it to be a live cd
[10:16:26] <alkisg> If you already have a linux PC nearby, you can netboot the laptop with the most recent ubuntu version
[10:16:35] <alkisg> You don't need a usb or cd that way
[10:17:16] <alkisg> But anyway do it however you want :)
[10:17:41] <morgans> to repeat, because I have cd blanks and no dvd blank and dont know where any flash drives are. (It took me ages of going through boxes in my bakers rack of electronics to find the box of cd's, bland, some computer and some music. -- glad to find those)
[10:18:11] <morgans> what, net boot? never heard of that. sock it to me bro.

[16:48:02] <drdo> I understand that

[16:48:12] <drdo> But try booting the desktop version live cd
[16:48:19] <Harlin> ok
[16:48:21] <drdo> Don't install, just go into the live cd

[16:48:59] <drdo> If it does there's no reason why you couldn't get X to work well on the server version
[16:49:08] <Harlin> oh
[16:49:11] <Harlin> how do you install X
[16:49:16] <drdo> apt install xorg

[16:49:27] <drdo> wait, are you literally trying to run gimp on the console?
[16:49:41] <Harlin> yeah isn't that what everyone's trying to do ultimately?
[16:49:44] *** Joins: ElectronApps (~ElectronA@user/electronapps)
[16:49:56] <drdo> That doesn't work obviously, you need an X server

[16:50:17] <drdo> no
[16:50:20] <Harlin> ok
[16:50:29] <drdo> and you will need a window manager

[16:52:01] <Harlin> you've never heard of Windows?
[16:52:07] <ThinkT510> so you are looking for terminal equivalents so that you don't need to run xorg or wayland display server?

[16:53:24] <drdo> Why did you even ask for help then?
[16:53:27] <Harlin> That sounds heavy.
[16:53:30] <ogra> the applications yu want to run *need* it
[16:53:44] <Harlin> ogra, oh ? Gimp needs Windows?
[16:53:52] <drdo> Are we being trolled?
[16:53:54] <drdo> I think we are
[16:53:56] <Harlin> Oh my, I am way off.
[16:54:04] <ogra> to run a graphical application you need a graphical environment the application can run on
[16:54:09] <Harlin> ok
[16:54:25] <Harlin> So then the Linux windows is x windows?
[16:54:32] <Harlin> maybe that's where I got confused.
[16:54:33] <ogra> Xorg or wayland provinde the lowest bit of this graphical environment ...
[16:54:56] <ogra> but to move the app windows around, to close the apps etc you need also a so called "window manager"

[16:55:28] <ogra> they are different implementations of the lowest layer of a graphical environment
[16:55:28] <Harlin> glad i asked
[16:55:42] <drdo> Don't worry about the difference, just go read about X

[16:55:54] <drdo> You don't even understand that, there's no need to get more confusion
[16:55:55] <Harlin> is it actually called X?
[16:56:01] <drdo> yes
[16:56:01] <drdo> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System
[16:56:10] <Harlin> that's really a ubiquitous name when you think about it.
[16:56:10] <ogra> X is the short name of Xorg
[16:56:14] <Harlin> ok
[16:56:18] <Harlin> x.org ?
[16:56:19] <drdo> Xorg is an implemention of X
[16:56:27] <Harlin> oh Xorg.
[16:56:28] <drdo> There are others, xorg is just the most common
[16:56:29] <Harlin> I see
[16:56:50] <ogra> it was originally called X11 ... then got renamed to Xorg ...
[16:56:58] <Harlin> ok
[16:57:08] <Harlin> thanks guys. I'll read some more. Sorry for the confusion.
[16:57:13] <ogra> X is just an overarching name of the whole thing

[23:25:40] <Apachez> Grobader: the keyboard have a value that each key sends out, this is then mapped to characters and corresponding utf8 values or whatever character enconding you use (there is even utf16 among others)
[23:27:52] <Grobader> @Apachez: So i had the idea to developers, but I'm not sure if my idea even make sense, ... if you have a program with key bindings, and you have a selection of multiple local keymaps/layouts for different languages/countries, and you change something in your own, and you'd want all  the other layouts to also update the changes ...

[23:29:48] <Apachez> and again normally there is a smooth motion... but when high cpu occurs (like loading 30 tabs at once) I noticed the choppiness after upgrading to 21.04, didnt exist the other day when the same box was on 20.10

[23:29:53] <Grobader> @Apachez: ... but if you write the same RSHIFT+Z into all the other layouts (picture the layouts as independent different profiles of the whole keyboard controls), the QUERTY keymaps would be misconfigured, unless could a converter be used ... would that make sense and be easy to develop?

[23:30:32] <lotuspsychje> Apachez: start browser from terminal, trace anything you can
[23:30:34] <Apachez> most apps reads the keys through the os keymap sort of speak
[23:30:50] <Apachez> what you seem to be wanting is the app reading the keyboard directly and using a local keymap
[23:31:03] <Apachez> I think this might be possible by adding env settings when starting your app
[23:31:20] <Apachez> similar to    LC_ALL=xxx /opt/appname    in the cli when starting something
[23:32:10] *** Quits: signofzeta (~signofzet@user/signofzeta) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:32:12] <Grobader> Yeah, I'm not sure if something like this is more simple to solve or if a solution already exists that could be used, so my own idea was a converter built-in application, so that it would know how to use the same location and use the correct key for that keymap
[23:32:36] *** Joins: signofzeta (~signofzet@user/signofzeta)
[23:32:41] <Apachez> I think what you are asking for already exists like with prefix the app name when starting
[23:32:55] <Grobader> Exists?
[23:32:56] <Apachez> but you perhaps are more asking for a gui overlay to do the same
[23:34:11] <Apachez> Grobader: for example starting your app in cli with just       /opt/appname        vs using something like       LC_ALL=C /opt/appname

[23:36:18] *** Parts: vxwarlock (~netzone@user/vxwarlock) (Closing Window)
[23:36:28] <Grobader> ... earlier. So what I came up is: When you're in the app's keybind settings to configure hotkeys, and you're editing the de_DE keymap for example, you change one of the hotkeys to "Z" and you press on the "Z" on your de_DE keyboard which is to the left of "X", ... I would want all of the other keymap profiles in that app also updated automaticaly
[23:36:29] <Grobader> by a built in system. But It shouldn't apply this "Z" to  the en_US keymap profile, it should translate to what makes sense in that case, and that would be "Y"
[23:36:59] <Apachez> Grobader: here is an example of similar case  https://askubuntu.com/questions/655628/assign-default-keyboard-language-per-application
[23:37:10] <Apachez> is that what you are looking for?
[23:39:25] *** Quits: signofzeta (~signofzet@user/signofzeta) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:39:31] <Grobader> No because this is about a general idea, it does not exist in any app that I know, it is not about selecting languages for  the GUI or anything, it's just for how the hotkeys register the keys, I do not have an en_US keyboard and the program I'm talkign about only supports en_US keymap, we're trying to support more locales.
