[04:59:36] <Dagmar> No becuase it's still perfectly useless.
[04:59:37] <akk> There are killer features in IDEs, for sure. But I've never had a chance to use an IDE that didn't make me give up a lot of efficiency to get the added features.
[04:59:54] <Dagmar> If I start writing sh*tcode while I'm using IntelliJ _it literally calls me on it_
[04:59:56] <akk> It's never been a good trade-off for me, but I definitely understand why it would be for a lot of people.
[05:00:08] <Gustavo6046> Anyone could write their own providers and extensions for it. And of course, since we're here for developer friendliness to begin with, it'd be piss easy to do those thanks to a good API and stuff

[05:08:08] <Gustavo6046> you can have a text editor, a file manager, and a documentation browser open as windows, and you could argue that a bare bones IDE with those things doesn't do anything more than a windowm anager does

[05:09:26] <Gustavo6046> IDEs are conventionally a text editor front and center, a few sidebars, and a toolbar at the top; those could be individual windows, but I'm saying that how they are arranged visually matters

[05:09:59] <blei> the set of possible IDEs lies in the space of IDEs which is well known to be a chaotic attractor. in short, the IDE you end up with strongly depends on where you start. in this case, modern IDEs are influenced by past acts such as the big bang, cambrian explosion, and a prominent crucifixion, the latter of which has inspired many an IDE

[06:32:07] <bitskit> The simplest form of GCC using a mark and sweep algorithm when it uses either two-color or three-color marking
[06:32:18] <CuriosTiger> but I did it with pointer arithmetic rather than using classes and inheritance.
[06:32:33] <CuriosTiger> My professor remarked that my program also compiled with a plain C compiler.

[08:22:37] <bitskit> The fact that we presume to know what temperature stars are and what they're made of is based on kirchoffs law of thermal radiation. Problem is that it's experimentally, the radiation of a cavity DOES depend on the nature of the walls and thus not every cavity behaves like a blackbody. Consequently, the wavelength of the light from stars not actually correspond to their temperature

[09:24:33] <bitskit> e.g. based on dark energy, GR predicts that the entire universe is expanding from a single point. But based on the CMB, for that to happen, there has to be a period of "inflation" which everything in the entire universe spreads out many orders of magnitude faster than the speed of light.

[10:14:37] <Gustavo6046> how come they didn't send nukes despite the many proxy wars
[10:14:52] <Gustavo6046> the Ukraine war is pretty smalltime compared to what the Cold War was
[10:15:27] <bitskit> also probably won't be nukes because nukes requires extremely rare and expensive materials to make. If any of them are released, they're going to be small. One could probably explode at your work and rattle your windows, but you'll have time to pack your shit and get out before the fallout sets in

[23:58:18] <Adoi> hello, I have an application on my desktop which I cant remove with 'apt purge...' it is not among 'dpkg' installs, either. how can I find out how to remove it?
[23:58:36] <znf> How did you install it?
[23:58:42] <Adoi> I dont remember
[23:59:20] <Adoi> but it is not one of the above methods, it seems. also possibly not via some package management tool
[23:59:32] <movah4c> programm name ?
