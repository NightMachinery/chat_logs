[20:53:15] <maerwald> fendor[m]: push a tag?
[20:53:29] <fendor[m]> we are missing some readme update
[20:53:34] <fendor[m]> working on it
[20:54:04] <maerwald> https://github.com/haskell/vscode-haskell/issues/551
[21:08:27] <fendor[m]> karim: Also, have you seen https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/discussions/2700, in particular https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/discussions/2700#discussioncomment-2423957
[21:31:00] <maerwald> fendor[m]: your PR is skewed I think
[21:31:06] <maerwald> you prolly need to rebase
[21:31:24] <fendor[m]> yeah, definitely skewed
[21:34:01] <fendor[m]> better now, but I am still thinking about the readme
[21:40:10] <fendor[m]> maerwald, so, I am trying the extension out locally again, and I encounter the following error messages:
[21:40:10] <fendor[m]> https://paste.tomsmeding.com/HifWiiVU
[21:40:30] <fendor[m]> Can we get ghcup to omit colourful output? The logs are eating them
[21:40:56] <maerwald> NO_COLOR or NOCOLOR
[21:41:00] <maerwald> don't remember which one
[21:41:12] <maerwald> the former
[21:41:19] <maerwald> but that doesn't remove control chars, unfortunately
[21:41:46] <fendor[m]> ok, nice!
[21:41:46] <fendor[m]> Also, why did it try to install GHC? I do have GHC installed (even the same version) with nix
[21:42:18] <maerwald> you don't have enough disk space on /tmp
[21:43:26] <maerwald> fendor[m]: is that GHC exposed in PATH?
[21:43:39] <fendor[m]> yeah, I don't know why my tmpfs is only 1.6GB on my system... Can't remember formatting this
[21:44:27] <fendor[m]> yeah
[21:45:47] <maerwald> https://github.com/haskell/vscode-haskell/blob/334f4004d2cca36897492dd8c1a87b50e756df51/src/hlsBinaries.ts#L276
[21:46:43] <maerwald> boolean bugs
[21:48:50] <maerwald> if the executable 'ghc' does not exist and you've configured `installGHC`, then it will install a GHC
[21:48:54] <fendor[m]> really? if not exists and this setting, then download, otherwise don't 
[21:49:40] <maerwald> doesn't sound too bad
[21:49:43] <fendor[m]> yeah, isn't that the correct logic?
[21:49:59] <maerwald> so does the exectuable exist?
[21:50:18] <fendor[m]> yeah
[21:50:31] <maerwald> did you run `executableExists('ghc')`?
[21:50:38] <fendor[m]> maybe some PATH shenanigans? 
[21:53:35] *** Quits: sloorush (~sloorush@136.233.9.99) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[21:58:46] <fendor[m]> the path looks good in the extension
[21:59:22] <maerwald> does `which` find it?
[22:00:26] <fendor[m]> yeah
[22:03:17] <fendor[m]> if you look at the logs, only a second invocation round actually tries to instal lghc
[22:03:50] <fendor[m]> e.g. compare `ghcup --no-verbose run --hls 1.6.1.0 --cabal 3.6.2.0 --stack 2.7.5 --install` vs `ghcup --no-verbose run --hls 1.6.1.0 --cabal 3.6.2.0 --stack 2.7.5 --ghc 8.10.7 --install`
[22:04:02] <maerwald> yes: https://github.com/haskell/vscode-haskell/blob/334f4004d2cca36897492dd8c1a87b50e756df51/src/hlsBinaries.ts#L313
[22:04:35] <maerwald> the PATH ghc is only used for bootstrapping
[22:05:23] <maerwald> you'd now have to compare the output of `ghc --numeric-version` with `projectGhc`
[22:06:46] <fendor[m]> but why are the two invocations different?
[22:06:53] *** Joins: sloorush (~sloorush@136.233.9.99)
[22:07:06] <maerwald> because one is for bootstrapping, the other is for HLS
[22:07:20] <maerwald> you need a toolchain to invoke `hls --project-ghc`
[22:07:36] <maerwald> if you want your system GHC, set installGHC to false
[22:07:59] <fendor[m]> oook, makes sense
[22:08:40] <maerwald> the only reason I'm considering PATH ghc is because installing GHC takes time, so doing it twice, just for bootstrapping can be awkward
[22:08:45] <sloorush> Hey! I was trying to run a build of HLS to test out some modifications, but I'm not sure if my custom build is running or not, is there any way to check?
[22:08:45] <sloorush> I'm sorry I got disconnected. Also is there any way to get the logs of the irc?
[22:09:57] <fendor[m]> sloorush, the various matrix clients save logs for you usually
[22:10:58] <michaelpj> sloorush: typically the client logs will say what binary they're starting? or you can always look at the process tree ðŸ˜…
[22:12:18] <maerwald> fendor[m]: but if you want it to consider PATH ghc as well fully, go ahead
[22:12:53] <fendor[m]> ðŸ˜€ I am not sure we want that much implicit behaviour... Maybe this is still reasoable?
[22:12:56] <maerwald> you'll need `comparePVP` and make sure to catch possible promise failure from callAsync
[22:14:10] <maerwald> I don't find it too interesting either
[22:17:07] <fendor[m]> what do we need `comparePVP` for? Why aren't we fine with just any version? 
[22:18:14] <maerwald> fendor[m]: ?
[22:18:27] <maerwald> because it might not be the *project* GHC
[22:19:07] <sloorush> michaelpj, Thanks
[22:20:25] <fendor[m]> yeah, I shouldn't complain, the way it works now is pretty much fool-proof
[22:20:52] *** Quits: arrowd (~arr@78.107.6.128) ()
[22:21:05] <fendor[m]> (btw, it is NO_COLOR)
[22:23:37] <maerwald> yeah, there's a standard for it
[22:23:45] <maerwald> https://no-color.org/
[22:23:50] <maerwald> someone provided that as a PR
[22:27:47] <fendor[m]> pretty cool
[22:28:54] <fendor[m]> ffs, npm audit goes bonkers all the time
