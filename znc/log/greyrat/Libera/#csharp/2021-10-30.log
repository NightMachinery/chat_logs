[10:01:44] <bomb> sysRPL fpvectorial vs aggpas?
[10:02:12] <sysRPL> i haven't use fpvectorial
[10:02:32] <sysRPL> but agg IMO is not at all a usable system
[10:02:52] <sysRPL> i'd say 3rd option -> cairo
[10:04:16] <sysRPL> works on any platform and is easy to use -> https://www.cairographics.org/
[10:05:23] <bomb> Cairo is nice, but can I use it inside the Win32 GUI?
[10:05:26] <sysRPL> this project of mine is based on cairo. there is a video demon on the page -> https://github.com/sysrpl/Codebot.Animator
[10:05:31] <sysRPL> yeah
[10:05:52] <sysRPL> gimp on windows uses cairo
[10:05:58] <sysRPL> smae with inkscape
[10:06:04] <sysRPL> any gtk based app uses cairo
[10:06:06] <bomb> but they're all Gtk :\
[10:06:17] <sysRPL> you don't eneed to use gtk
[10:06:32] <sysRPL> cairo has win32 window interop functions
[10:06:56] <sysRPL> https://www.cairographics.org/manual/cairo-Win32-Surfaces.html
[10:07:05] *** Joins: Booster2ooo (~Booster2o@user/booster2ooo)
[10:07:10] <sysRPL> if you udnerstand windows, that's about as easy as it gets
[10:07:29] <bomb> but it's not as easy as drag & dropping a Cairo canvas into a Lazarus form, right?
[10:07:31] <sysRPL> that is, you know what HDC and HWND are
[10:07:53] <bomb> yeah, unfortunately I do, but I was thinking maybe make something that works cross-platform
[10:08:20] <sysRPL> cario works cross platform ... you just need to change one line
[10:09:03] <bomb> of course, but what about easy LCL + Cairo integration?
[10:09:06] <sysRPL> so, if you drop a TPaintBox or anything with a TCanvas on a form, heck even a form has a canvas and a bitmap has a canvas
[10:09:38] <sysRPL> then just do this -> cairo := cairo_win32_surface_create(Canvas.Handle) ... and then you can use cairo
[10:09:42] <sysRPL> one line
[10:09:44] <bomb> oh, Cairo can make use of TPaintBox?
[10:10:03] <sysRPL> it makes use of a TPaintBox, and a TPaintBox has a TCanvas
[10:10:08] <bomb> ayyy
[10:10:19] <sysRPL> it can use anything with a TCanvas
[10:10:45] <sysRPL> just change the cairo_win32_surface_create to cairo_gtk_surface_create
[10:11:50] <bomb> how come it's not anywhere mentioned in Lazarus wiki lol
[10:11:55] <sysRPL> or even using a paltform detecting ifdef to hide all that
[10:12:16] <sysRPL> because cairo is not affiliated with fpc or lazarus
[10:12:25] <sysRPL> and it's an external library
[10:12:31] <bomb> wiki has aggpas examples though
[10:12:43] <sysRPL> that's because aggpas is a port
[10:13:12] <sysRPL> some fpc people don't like to use stuff that isn't ported
[10:13:44] <bomb> I see
[10:13:45] <sysRPL> i prefer to not use ports ... i want the implementation as current and direct from the original source
[10:13:57] <sysRPL> ports are worse anyhow
[10:14:07] <bomb> ports eats ass
[10:14:12] <sysRPL> well
[10:15:13] <sysRPL> you still need a pascal unit to declare the cairo functions ... but the cairo itnerface functions are included with the compiler in their packages source folder
[10:15:14] <bomb> did you check out Gtk4 btw?
[10:15:39] <sysRPL> i am stuck on gtk2. i've tried to use gtk3 and haven't done too much
[10:16:08] <sysRPL> too much to get gtk3 working ... imo gtk3/4 doesn't bring much to the table
[10:16:17] <sysRPL> unless you want wayland
[10:16:20] <sysRPL> and wayland sucks
[10:16:55] <sysRPL> wayland brings in all these concerns about security that actually impare your desktop
[10:16:59] <bomb> I'm kinda tired of anything Gtk related lately
[10:17:07] <bomb> KDE w/ X works fine for me
[10:17:07] <sysRPL> use mint
[10:17:23] <sysRPL> mint cannamn IMO is the optimal user experience
[10:18:21] <sysRPL> it has the windows xp/7 style ... with a nice `start menu` sensible `control panel` better `taskbar`
[10:18:26] <bomb> derives from GNOME :(
[10:18:36] <sysRPL> and customization that makes actual sense
[10:18:46] <sysRPL> i prefere C based apis like gnome
[10:18:46] <bomb> KDE does a good job for Windows style IMHO
[10:19:03] <sysRPL> C++ apis are a pain to work with
[10:19:29] <bomb> for porting. but would you really develop an app in C instead of C++?
[10:19:49] <sysRPL> the entire windows ecosystem is based on A apis
[10:20:05] <sysRPL> CreateWindowEx - C api
[10:20:16] <sysRPL> GetMessage - C api
[10:20:39] <sysRPL> * the entire windows ecosystem is based on C apis
[10:20:46] <bomb> that's why Delphi kinda dominated the desktop dev until .NET became a thing

[10:22:10] <sysRPL> c# borrowed allot from delphi
[10:22:39] <sysRPL> and anders was trying to borrow those sames things from delphi for vj++ before they got sued and lost
[10:22:57] <bomb> heh. J++ could still be a thing if Microsoft treated Sun like Google did
[10:23:36] <sysRPL> j++ was sued into oblivion because ms was creating delphi like exntensions to make the langauge better
[10:24:05] <sysRPL> but sun/oracle saw that as an attempt to make a proprietry java that would only run on windows, and they were right
[10:24:31] <sysRPL> the main thing delphi has that c# copied and they tried to copy into vj++has is the delphi PME model
[10:24:52] <sysRPL> where objects have properties, methods and events
[10:25:09] <sysRPL> java doesn't have the last two
[10:25:26] <bomb> it does now XD
[10:26:09] <sysRPL> this is whatg allows you in delphi to write ... Button.OnClick := DoSomething; ... a pretty standard thing you ought to be able do when rpgoramming in a graphical user interface
[10:26:38] <sysRPL> java tried to say you MUST make inner classes to do events like OnClick above
[10:26:41] <bomb> yeah it's phenomenal

[10:30:16] <sysRPL> i was at the PDC 2008 when .NET was announced
[10:30:45] <sysRPL> i said i HATE how C# doesn't prepend On to events, but instead prepends On to the virtual methods
[10:30:52] <sysRPL>  when you prepend the On infront of the event names, you can view a class and see all the events together, rather than searching through intellisense

[10:37:03] <sysRPL> btw, if you are using lazarus, i have a project relase coming out in a few days that may interest you
[10:38:19] <MatthiasVance> Oh cool you can now launch windows terminal by running cmd
[10:53:27] <bomb> what project sysRPL
[10:54:29] <sysRPL> i am writing a vector graphics rendering system built on opengl es2 or gl3, along with a hpyscis system, sound system, and an opengl widget library
[10:54:59] <bomb> sounds cool
[10:55:15] <sysRPL> when it's does i'll integrate it into my already existing game engine, but it will also stand alone
[10:55:34] <sysRPL> some demos -> https://streamable.com/m4e4qn
[10:55:45] <sysRPL> https://streamable.com/fm02c4
[10:56:05] <MatthiasVance> So wait if you want to know more about the PDF standard you have to buy it?
[10:56:39] <sysRPL> i am working on with wisget system right now ... i have buttons, check boxes, test boxes, glyph switches, panels, windows, and sliders
[10:56:56] <sysRPL> widget system even
[10:57:14] <sysRPL> and it's all themeable
[10:57:32] <sysRPL> actually i am writing the first theme as i am typing here
[10:59:14] <bomb> looking good so far
[10:59:27] <sysRPL> i need to revisit the blending system again. i've made some improvements in that area
[11:00:18] <sysRPL> here is an early example of the physics system in my library -> https://www.getlazarus.org/videos/physics/collisions/
[11:00:25] <bomb> bum blending is best blending
[11:11:27] <bomb> sysRPL are you gonna present it as full-blown engine for everyone, or it's for your own use?
[11:12:29] <sysRPL> it'll will be released in stages, for everyone as FOSS with the appropriate license
[11:12:42] <sysRPL> the first stage is the vector graphics and widget system
[11:12:58] <sysRPL> the second is the physics system
[11:13:18] <sysRPL> the third is sound + more input + better widgets
[11:13:32] <sysRPL> then finally i'll roll it all back into my existing game engine
[11:14:11] <sysRPL> whihc has thigns like shaders, video decoding, animation storyboards / sprite bone system
[11:14:54] <sysRPL> https://github.com/sysrpl/Bare.Game
[11:17:48] <bomb> aye. that's a big scoop
[11:38:30] <MatthiasVance> The links in that repo's readme go to ... weird websites

[14:18:15] <MatthiasVance> You seem to grasp more of what is required to make a game so either is a good option?
[14:18:22] <MatthiasVance> Do you have any ideas for either?
[14:19:34] <bomb> for the game, something 'nerdy' like this one, maybe: https://store.steampowered.com/app/370360/TIS100/
[14:21:51] <MatthiasVance> I love that they show how many people have bought it
[14:22:29] <bomb> reviews are usually 2% of purchases
[14:23:05] *** zaher_ is now known as zaher
[14:23:05] <MatthiasVance> What do you mean by that?
[14:25:57] <bomb> usually, 2% of the people who buy a game on Steam, submit a review for the game
[14:26:26] <bomb> so the real sales are likely 50 times of the review count
[14:26:50] <MatthiasVance> ah yeah but the actual range is on the bottom of the page
[14:27:00] <MatthiasVance> sure it's a range but tells you the order of scale
[14:27:08] <MatthiasVance> ie 10k - 20k or 100k - 200k or 1m - 2m
[14:30:07] <bomb> where did you see those numbers?

[17:07:08] <MatthiasVance> super awkward but okay, I'll just read a blok of 1K or 4K bytes and then search for CRs
[17:08:20] <bpmedley> MatthiasVance : Aren't some streams seekable?
[17:08:37] <MatthiasVance> Yes that's why I read the last 1k bytes or something
[17:08:42] <MatthiasVance> But I was wondering if there's a better way
[17:08:59] <bpmedley> Yeah, searching for the last N arbitrary lines is a pita.
[17:10:19] <bomb> you'll include the entire PDF file into memory either way. why would you stream?
[17:12:20] <MatthiasVance> bomb: Good point
[17:12:33] <MatthiasVance> Although, why would you keep the whole file in memory?
[17:13:00] <bomb> I don't know, aren't you gonna parse the whole thing?
[17:13:22] <MatthiasVance> that is true but I was thinking I could work with IEnumerable<T>
[17:13:36] <MatthiasVance> because the file format kind of allows that
[17:13:40] <bomb> well, you can still stream from the memory
[17:13:52] <MatthiasVance> yeah where the data is is not important
[17:13:54] <MatthiasVance> it's in a stream
[17:14:05] <MatthiasVance> Now I don't get your original point :P
[17:15:05] <bomb> nvm, I don't know what I'm talking about XD
[17:15:05] <bomb> but https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.filestream.seek?view=net-5.0
[17:15:19] <MatthiasVance> Yes I know how to seek
[17:15:31] <MatthiasVance> My current solution is "read block of X bytes at the end of the stream"
[17:16:45] <bomb> so you solved your problem?
[17:18:04] <MatthiasVance> I said that earlier, just looking if there are better solutions, like really parsing but backwards =)
[17:22:06] <bomb> copy the last N bytes of the file into memory, reverse it, stream from that array?

[17:28:21] <bomb> bpmedley he said last 3 lines, but if that's the case, he can try last N bytes, then last N*2 bytes, and so on
[17:28:41] <bpmedley> bomb : Last N lines does not mean the character count is known for each line..

[17:39:46] <bomb> MatthiasVance you can just look for the carriage returns by just reading the last 1K, or maybe, 4K byte block

[17:42:23] <bomb> you know what I noticed, sometimes I avoid writing auxiliary functions because I don't wanna bother to make a new namespace/package & class for them
[17:42:48] <MatthiasVance> That's one thing that I have less of an issue with in F# :)
[17:42:52] <bomb> non-OOP guys don't have that arbitrary obstacle. they just write a function and makes use of it
[17:42:58] <MatthiasVance> indeed
[17:43:06] <bomb> haha I was gonna mention maybe that's why you liked F#
[17:43:15] <MatthiasVance> less overhead, less writing code
[17:45:04] <bomb> yeah. it becomes more apparent when I don't work on a multi-engineer codebase of 10 million lines, which is 99% of the case lately :D
[17:45:34] <MatthiasVance> I still don't know enough about F# to have the full picture though
