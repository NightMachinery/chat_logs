[01:42:08] <hunboy> ah ok :) auto value is not animatable :(

[01:44:51] <eXtr3m0> https://jsfiddle.net/ygx4tqe0/
[01:44:57] <eXtr3m0> there is a max-height trick though
[01:45:16] <eXtr3m0> only the timings are off, because the max height value is so high in this case. you see the animation is faster than 1s
[01:46:35] <entropy_> also
[01:46:44] <hunboy> entropy_, https://jsfiddle.net/73zfnbac/
[01:47:56] <entropy_> hunboy can you make it faster when it retracts?
[01:48:34] <stenno> can you try it yourself maybe?
[01:48:42] <hunboy> you can play with 300ms values
[01:48:46] <stenno> ^
[01:49:38] <stenno> that would also show that you have understood the css
[01:49:46] <stenno> which is the important thing

[03:01:36] <hunboy> should i modify something? it's reduced.
[03:01:46] <Stinger> yeaaah I have been thinking about moving to grid
[03:02:27] <hunboy> actually in grid item the height: 100% works well
[03:02:36] <hunboy> but tables ....

[03:06:45] <hunboy> sticky header doesn't work in table btw :)
[03:08:36] <Stinger> hmm can you get a concept of a row in a grid
[03:08:48] <Stinger> that was one of my reasons for not switching
[03:08:54] <Stinger> I want a double click action on a row
[03:12:52] <Stinger> hmm I think I've fixed the table now (in concept) see if I can fix it in app.
[03:13:31] <Stinger> have to set table height: 1px which is horrible and was affecting my following div position
[03:13:50] <Stinger> but seems to be working now in chromium so there must be some trick i've missed in my apps css
[03:15:28] <hunboy> yeah there is .row {display: contents} property

[14:04:17] <fweht> whats the best way to set a flex gap, but so that the flexbox first makes sure all items are fit in the container and only then, if there is space left, applies the gap?  e.g. if the container is 200px height and 3 children are 50px each and gap is 5px, it should apply, but when the children are 65px each, the gap should be reduced to  5/3 px?

[23:20:08] <varjack> the first image is the html, the second is the checkbox unchecked, the third is it checked, and the last one is using the svg as an object. it does not register checks
[23:20:52] <stenno> have you checked if the label has the height and width it needs
[23:21:23] <varjack> yeah, i'm not really sure why it doesn't load with the <img> tag

[23:21:54] <varjack> it's a 512x512 svg and even that size didn't load
[23:22:55] <varjack> wait i have an idea
[23:34:18] <varjack> ok well, i found something that sorta works i guess
[23:35:07] <varjack> i wanted to have an image i could change the color of when i clicked it, so i figured an svg would work best, but the first solution i found ended up using a filter which works on a png anyway, so i just swapped in a png and it works as i want it to
