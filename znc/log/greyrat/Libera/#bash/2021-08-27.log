[00:26:24] <greycat> earnestly: sending INT to bash with kill() or a shell's kill command gives no special treatment.  The specialness comes in when you're running a script in a terminal, and you press Ctrl-C (or whatever intr is bound to).  The terminal driver then sends INT to all the "foreground" processes.

[05:20:33] <greycat> the \[ and \] are bash PS1 syntax
[05:20:46] <greycat> the \033[1;32m is a terminal-specific escape sequence

[05:26:13] <thebombzen> you can also assign to a variable with tput
[05:26:25] <xx> I'm aware of all that
[05:26:34] <xx> and have been looking through manpages of xterm and tput
[05:26:51] <xx> but don't see any mention of how to obtain the code for 'red' or 'bold'
[05:26:57] <thebombzen> bold="\[$(tput bold)\]"
[05:27:08] <greycat> If you only want the normal stuff, you can use tput.  If you want the *extra special snowflake* stuff (like 256 colors), you will end up reading the advanced xterm manuals (not the man page).
[05:27:18] <thebombzen> the colors are something like, red="\[$(tput setaf 1)\]"
[05:27:23] <greycat> Then you will just hope your terminal emulates xterm closely enough.

[05:29:53] <xx> thebombzen: yeah I want a document as opposed to trial&error

[10:41:25] <stevenm> is it even remotely possible (somehow, in anyway way) to send a backspace (e.g. echo -e '\b') to a file and have it delete the last char?
[10:42:49] <llua> do you know what \b does?
[10:43:15] <stevenm> I know it's meant to move the cursor back one on a tty
[10:43:31] <stevenm> not actually delete a character
[10:43:43] *** Joins: aakashi2001 (~aakashi20@user/aakashi2001)
[10:43:45] <llua> so...
[10:44:09] <llua> like
[10:44:15] <llua> yeah~
[10:44:20] <selckin> i'm really curious why you could possibly need that now
[10:44:45] <stevenm> so what I'm saying is if I'm dumping what I output to a tty... also to a log file... would there be some easy way of converting those \b's to something which'll be processable by whatever is adding to the logfile - to simulate the same
[10:45:01] <stevenm> hence the "in anyway".. "way" err... yeah
[10:47:35] <selckin> maybe look into 'script'
[10:47:49] *** Joins: jrofd (~test@185.198.243.174)
[10:48:07] <stevenm> as in generally 'scripting' - or are you talking about something specific with a confusing sounding name?
[10:48:12] <selckin> script -c yourcmd logfile.txt does that, but might not work for whatever you're doing
[10:48:22] <selckin> !script
[10:48:22] <greybot> script(1) allows you to record an interactive session in a terminal. Also, you can use it instead of expect(1) for simple tasks, because it creates a pty.
[10:48:49] <stevenm> ah ok brill, thanks :)

[14:32:57] <pj> starting with -e
[14:32:59] <pj> !-e
[14:32:59] <greybot> "set -e" is an inheritance of the old bourne shell, and doesn't really work well with modern shell features. You'll really have less buggy scripts if you do the error handling manually instead of relying on the unreliable "set -e"; see http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/105
[14:33:07] <wwilliam> ![[
[14:33:07] <greybot> [[ is a bash keyword similar to (but more powerful than) the [ command. See <http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/031> and <http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide/TestsAndConditionals>. Unless you're writing for POSIX sh, we recommend [[.
[14:35:12] <pj> lots of missing quotes, lots of relying on word-splitting in the completely worst way.
[14:35:12] <cousteau> pj: well actually... man bash / CONDITIONAL EXPRESSIONS says that == is recognized 
[14:35:25] <pj> cousteau: for [[ ... ]] it is.
[14:36:17] <Soliton> it works in bash but it makes little sense to use it with test.
[14:36:19] <pj> the only reason to use [ ... ] is for POSIX compatibility, and POSIX doesn't recognize =
[14:36:40] <pj> he really should be using [[]]
[14:37:08] <cousteau> [ is a bash builtin, and its documentation says that it accepts the operators described in CONDITIONAL EXPRESSIONS, so if you write [ in a bash program you should be able to use == in it just fine

[19:00:47] <armin> ty
[19:02:01] <anddam> PapaChub, Soliton: just to make it clear using stty I am undefining the shortcut associated with killing current line, or last word, right? 
[19:02:27] <anddam> last word would be C-w and therefore I see how undefining that may have sense, since I am redefining it in ~/.inputrc
[19:02:37] <PapaChub> (FTR: I fat-fingered "shopt -s extglob" above, in the "decimal" hack)
[19:02:50] <anddam> Soliton: but why current line that would be C-u? 
[19:03:08] <anddam> PapaChub: that's clearly a lisp form

[19:04:09] <Soliton> explained in the same section.
[19:04:37] *** Joins: Drek45 (~jrept371@154.21.23.27)
[19:04:38] <PapaChub> anddam, stty will "capture" certain control characters before bash/readline gets a chance to handle them.  'stty kill' is probably overriding C-u (and 'stty werase' grabs C-w)

[19:05:59] <PapaChub> armin, Yup.  "man bash" and search for ,, (Case modification)
[19:06:05] <Soliton> at least the defaults for those two are ^U and ^W you could also change those defaults.
[19:06:25] <anddam> PapaChub: that is clear, but what I understood is "you set a C-w association for readline, that is not read by default when you start bash, so run 'stty kill ^-' this will disable killing current line and reload the readline init file thus achieving your result"
[19:07:11] <armin> PapaChub: interesting, present on my nixos bash man-page, but not on my macos machine even though that has 5.1.8 from homebrew
[19:07:14] <armin> ty
[19:07:22] <Soliton> no, it looks like readline settings are "ocerwritten" by terminal settings so by unsetting those you get your readline config.
[19:07:41] <anddam> but while I see how werase would be appropriate, since it's associated to C-w by default and I am rassigning that, I don't get why kill would be a proper char to disable

[19:09:31] <anddam> Soliton: or would disabling any special character have worked anyway and kill was the first to come to your mind?
[19:09:32] <PapaChub> anddam, 'stty kill' is (effectively) 'backward-kill-line' not, like, "kill(1) a process"
[19:09:37] <Soliton> no clue what you said then.
[19:09:59] <anddam> let me rephrase 
[19:10:16] <Soliton> if you understand that werase defaults to ^W then no idea what's different with kill defaulting to ^U.

[19:12:35] <Soliton> you tell the terminal to not handle ^U so that readline does.
[19:12:43] <PapaChub> Maybe, if you're trying to override C-u, it might help to say, "Run 'stty -a' and look for a line that looks like:  _____ = ^U".  Whatever ____ is, you have to set that to 'undef' a.k.a "^-"  ?
[19:12:51] <anddam> jeeez
