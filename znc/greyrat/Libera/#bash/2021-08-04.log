[00:18:59] <a1fa> whats the difference between source and running the actual command? 
[00:19:13] <greycat> source causes your current shell to read and execute the commands
[00:19:24] <greycat> running a script creates a *new* shell which reads and executes the commands
[00:19:49] <a1fa> thank you - this was really in reference to exporting variables
[00:20:12] <a1fa> so if you are "sourcing" then no need to export, unless they need to be read by another process?

[03:54:33] <nmz> its meant to be readable
[03:54:39] <nmz> like getflags is

[04:40:38] <herjazz> hi - not sure whether to ask this here or in vim
[04:41:08] <herjazz> question about vi mode in bash: if I want to enter the vi editor I ESC-v
[04:41:52] <herjazz> but if you :q! from there the command you were editing will automatically run
[04:42:48] <herjazz> I saw on stackexchange some guy has set it up so when entering vi it automatically prepends "#" to ward off any effects from :q!
[04:42:53] <herjazz> link: https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/30455/396006
[04:43:01] <herjazz> maatb's comment
[04:43:10] <herjazz> *mattb
[04:43:18] <herjazz> any idea on how to do that?
[04:44:18] <emanuele6> you can also just use C-z and then `kill %-'
[04:44:43] <emanuele6> or `%d|q' to exit
[04:44:48] <greycat> put # in front of the line, or clear the line entirely, before exiting

[04:45:17] <herjazz> sure but hardened vim users can do things on autopilot

[04:45:53] <herjazz> he has it set up so the # gets put in automatically when entering vi
[04:46:27] <herjazz> unclear from his comment whether that's done vim side or bash side (presumably some binding in .inputrc)
[04:46:36] <emanuele6> anyway it should be `autocmd BufRead /tmp/bash-* :norm I#<space><esc>A
[04:46:43] <emanuele6> or something like that
[04:46:49] <herjazz> ahh looks about right

[04:47:52] <emanuele6> you could even use /tmp/bash-fc.*
[04:48:00] <emanuele6> that's the prefix bash uses
[04:48:28] <herjazz> right, I'm guessing that would cover fc and ESC-v in vi mode

[09:55:45] <tirnanog> perhaps turn on xtrace and set BASH_XTRACEFD accordingly if it's a nuisance.
[09:57:24] <tirnanog> or, if you don't even need xtrace, just open a file to a particular file descriptor and print to it. you could tail it in another terminal.

[17:59:56] <makara> ancestor
[18:00:13] <lopid> **/sql/**/file for the latter
[18:00:15] <tirnanog> in that case, what you have looks ok but it should end with -prune.
[18:00:32] <tirnanog> and yes, globstar could also do it.
[18:01:11] <tirnanog> if you don't prune, the 'outer' find will continue to recurse into directories named "sql", which is unnecessarily expensive and could produce duplicate results.
[18:01:17] <makara> its just annoying find doesn't get updated, but im sure we've heard it all about find

[18:07:38] <Nintendo> The requirement was updated, then.  Soliton gets it.
[18:07:47] <makara> Nintendo: in xpath, gitignores, etc you might do something like to the effect of 'find //sql ...' and it would find all instances below ANY sql directory accessible from pwd

[19:05:23] <LoRez> I have the weirdest of problems.  I've got a shell script that I've been running successfully on my mac for a while that builds some docker containers.  It has a bash shebang and I've got the brew package for bash installed.  When I run this script, it can't find anything in the path.  I've added `env` to the script to ensure it's in the environment, and it is.
[19:05:55] <LoRez> Weirder, I can run things from the prompt that the script cannot find.  (5.1.8 btw)
[19:07:14] <Soliton> maybe the script is setting PATH.
[19:08:06] <LoRez> it isn't.
[19:08:26] <LoRez> er..  no.  I'm a dumbass.
[19:09:21] <LoRez> Thank you.

[19:22:11] *** Joins: Crescendo (~Crescendo@user/crescendo)
[19:23:37] <Ionic> Why exactly do shells, including bash, interpret a redirection such as 'filedes'>'file' as 'filedes' being an argument to the program instead of a file descriptor?
[19:25:30] <Soliton> a file descriptor is a number.
[19:25:58] <Ionic> Yes, assume that 'filedes' is a number, such as '2'
[19:26:17] <Ionic> Only quoted... I guess that makes parsing easier, but uhm...
[19:27:01] <Soliton> remove the quotes.
[19:27:33] <Soliton> you can't quote random syntax parts and expect them to work as without.
