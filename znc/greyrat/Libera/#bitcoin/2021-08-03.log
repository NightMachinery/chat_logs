[13:48:49] <Keele> AndyS2: I guess the question "all block" referred to validating all transactions in a new block. I'm no bitcoin wizard, but as far as I know, bitcoin-core does since a few years ago some optimizations where if the merkle tree root has been already validated as transactions propagated the network, they won't be revalidated.
[13:49:07] <Keele> happy to stand corrected if I just talked out of my ass :)
[13:55:26] *** Joins: gggp__ (~gggp@221.219.75.222)
[13:56:59] <AndyS2> Keele: ah, I read that differently because once the block is committed, it's already too late to check it? you'd check it beforehand? but I might be misinterpreting what gggp_ tried to ask.
[13:57:19] <AndyS2> and IIRC from reading the code yesterday, tx in mempool do not need to be validated again when they make it into a block, yes
[13:57:36] <AndyS2> hm, on the other hand
[13:58:12] <AndyS2> some part of the validation can be skipped I guess, but not the part that checks if the UTXO is still a UTXO ;)

[15:36:52] <earnestly> I think they're concerned about MitM style snooping/dos since the protocol bitcoin uses to talk with nodes isn't encrypted
[15:36:52] <caveman> Alver: i mean a cryptocurrency protocol that's over https.
[15:37:15] <earnestly> Alver: The 'https' is just a stand in for 'encrypted'
[15:38:14] <caveman> imo main advantage of making crypto currency over http2.0 is not the encryption, but rather that we will use standard apps, like nginx, to parse the protocol.  currently with btc having its own protocol, it's as if they've re-implementing this parsing for their own, hence more bug/security risks.

[15:39:25] <caveman> http2.0.
[15:39:49] <caveman> yes, get/post are already implemented by btc.
[15:39:58] <Alver> I'm trying to wrap my head around the "nginx" thing now. Like... having a full bitcoin node, with its hundreds-of-gigabytes blockchain, and then having an nginx to do the comms?
[15:40:47] <Alver> So re-implementing a full node in nginx? Or just having it do translations? Because both are double work then.
[15:40:47] <caveman> yes.  then delete protocol parsing from bitcoind.  bitcoind will be a web app.

[15:41:57] <caveman> less security risks as we'll be using a code that's already reviewed by many others.
[15:41:57] <earnestly> Alver: They want to reuse existing code that has been shaken down for bugs already
[15:42:29] <earnestly> This assumes that http is less complicated and less bug prone or at least equal to existing protocols

[16:02:21] <earnestly> Alver: The point being that parsing text based protocols like http is far more bug prone than bitcoin or any binary protocol and because the scope is much lower it is possible to be "finished" while they're already moving to http/3 due to epic design flaws in the rushed http/2 protocol heh
[16:02:32] <earnestly> Well, that would be my point
[16:04:01] <edcba> binary protocols aren't flawless though but yeah i still think it's safer
[16:04:54] <earnestly> I've noticed this pattern everywhere, that people aren't capable of understanding words like "more" or "fewer".  It's either A or B
[16:04:59] <edcba> take just some Content-Length: 234 you have to parse the int and that alone is a lot more complex than binary :)

[16:07:17] <earnestly> Martin Thompson also makes fairly nice talks on protocol design
[16:08:23] <edcba> anyway if you want http support you just need to put some api in front of a bitcoin core client
[16:10:44] <edcba> having http(s) as a protocol would just serve authorities to better track ppl as they can reuse existing tools, except that i don't see lol
[16:11:29] <earnestly> The idea would be to implement bitcoin in terms of http for its p2p communication.  I don't think caveman wants to do this though
[16:12:02] <earnestly> Just having it as a wrapper around core wouldn't gain the security review benefits of using http
[16:12:12] <edcba> really the only advantage is being able to run a client in corporate/school/proxied environment

[16:21:52] <caveman> <edcba> having http(s) as a protocol would just serve authorities to better track ppl as they can reuse existing tools, except that i don't see lol   <--   no.  rather makes it harder to track, as it will blend like normal web traffic.

[21:11:26] <caveman> edcba: true.  browsers are turing complete and can play 3D games too.  but they are immoral pieces of applications with too much fluff.  e.g. js, css, fancy rendering, etc.  extremely unjustified.
[21:12:17] <tutte> Hey!
[21:12:18] <tutte> :o
[21:12:40] <edcba> still ppl run browsers alongside bitcoin or whatever
[21:12:49] <caveman> alongside?  how?
[21:13:06] <edcba> well it's called multitasking
[21:13:17] <edcba> it's been a feature of OS since 40 years maybe
[21:13:25] <edcba> probably more
[21:13:37] <caveman> that's different.  virtual memory and stuff.  but it's better to have bitcoin in a separate pc.
[21:14:04] <edcba> yeah and it's better to not have it speak http
[21:14:46] <caveman> that i don't know.  because inventing more protocol pieces, instead of re-using existing, has its risks.
[21:15:11] <caveman> but maybe you're also right here.  maybe bitcoin's code is designed to a higher standard than nginx.

[21:17:24] <tutte> Hey guys.. I have a quick privacy related question.. Is it ok to ask here or am I in the wrong channel? :o
[21:17:42] <edcba> bitcoin privacy related ?
[21:17:47] <tutte> yes
[21:17:53] <edcba> i guess it's ok
[21:17:59] <tutte> okok.. :)
[21:18:56] <edcba> haha i looked at chan rules, it says "Therefore we do not allow any advice on bad practices. For example: web wallets are insecure by design"
[21:19:17] <edcba> but yeah http api is a bit different
[21:19:49] <caveman> web wallets, i think, are those sites that say ``trust us with your private keys, we will do everything and will promise to be honest''
[21:19:51] <Bullit> how to deal with the confirmations stacking up and eventually the thieves reporting in about their inferior BECH adress which it is stored on, my balance was legit I never visited america why you steal from me
[21:20:06] <edcba> caveman: yeah i think too, or some js implementation of anything
[21:20:08] <caveman> web wallets are not even bitcoin imo.  imo it's bitcoin only if it's a full node.

[21:20:44] <ocb> hello
[21:20:58] <tutte> So... Lets say I use a ledger hardware wallet to create a bitcoin adress (or an account as ledger calles it) to store some BTC... Then I go along to create a separate "account" with the same ledger hardware wallet (and the same xpub?). Is there any way to track that these two accounts are from the same xpub, priv-key or ledger device?
[21:22:01] <gggp_> for ipfs proto,what if the storage device got issues and down
[21:22:14] <gggp_> just curious
[21:22:34] <edcba> if your wallet has no flaw the bitcoin addresses generated should be independant and/or unrelatable
[21:23:24] <edcba> now the way you transmit transactions "may" hint they are related
[21:25:02] <tutte> So lets say someone (for example, the IRS) knows about two separate adresses, created with the same ledger, but no transaction trace to eachother. They will not be able to tell that is't from the same xpub?
[21:30:16] <ocb> i don't know how bitcoin works. i would like to ask a theoretical question. is it possible that 51% attacks on the network have happened earlier which are not known publicy?

[22:13:35] <ocb> but more like an attack to activate a bitcoin improvement patch
[22:14:55] <bugs_> well the essence is to change the series of blocks on the top of the blockchain
[22:15:12] <bugs_> and get the network to accept a different version of the most recent blocks
[22:16:00] <bugs_> so that definetly means there will be losers and they will be unhappy
[22:16:18] <bugs_> so it WOULD be noticed
[22:16:26] <bugs_> also consider the poor blockchain explorer coder
[22:16:40] <bugs_> their database just got a lot more complicated
[22:16:58] <bugs_> having to keep both sets of chain data for awhile
