[00:00:45] <droid3> Normally though meaning full polynomials factoring for most people is for Z[x] or Q[x] rings which we already said if you can do one with LLL then you can do the other with LLL.

[00:06:45] <droid3> we still have the issue at least for computers the irrationals have to be truncated into the rational domain anyway. So computers at best can work over Q[x]

[00:29:12] <tusko> When computing eigenvalues is there a preference for det(\lambda I - A) vs det(A - \lambda I)?
[00:29:29] <Z-module> the zeros of those two are the same, so not really
[00:29:30] <riv> det(A - \lambda I)
[00:29:32] <droid3> however factoring a polynomial over it still is quite challenging
[00:29:32] <qergle> tusko: are they any different?
[00:29:46] <qergle> tusko: usually you see A-λI in books
[00:30:04] <qergle> because they cancel things over to the left
[00:30:05] <Z-module> one is (-1)^n times the other
[00:30:24] <tusko> I think one results in cleaner equations or something
[00:30:26] <tusko> idk
[00:30:33] <qergle> Ax=λx -> Ax-λx=0 -> (A-λI)x=0
[00:30:50] <tusko> That's what I'm trying to ascertain.
[00:30:57] <qergle> you could also cancel things over the right
[00:31:04] <tusko> right
[00:31:22] <tusko> and the difference would have a different sign, presumably
[00:31:25] <qergle> Ax=λx -> 0=λx-Ax -> 0=(λI-A)x
[00:31:34] <cherim> I usually see det(lambda I - A) in my books though. Because leading coefficient of the characteristic polynomial +1 is better than something dependent on parity of dimension

[01:40:59] <biberao> hi
[01:41:08] <somiaj> But without stating what number system you are working in, it is hard to state what you are doing, but you often loose algebraic propertieis when you define division by zero
[01:41:32] <xormor> riv: that link shows how to handle complex numbers, infinity and infinitely small numbers, and division by zero. the smaller the number is used to divide, the closer to infinity it is. I think 1/0 is well-behaved in the Riemann sphere scheme. What about 1/(1/inf) or x/(1/inf)?
[01:41:41] <xormor> riv: ok
[01:42:19] <xormor> I like the kind of weird mathematics that is well behaved.
[01:42:33] <riv> it is interesting

[03:52:43] <buster> well. i don't know connections yet. i should try and pick that up. maybe from some combination of frankel and baez.
[03:53:13] <johnkeats6> you don't need it. but it is helpful to know about the klein-gordon and dirac equations
[03:55:38] <buster> oh i was wondering if you had read dirac's famous monopoles paper
[03:55:50] <buster> its prerequisites are pretty modest
[03:56:19] <johnkeats6> no
[03:56:22] <johnkeats6> guess i'll look at it
[03:56:34] <buster> and he makes it sound like he's inventing gauge invariance on the fly (i assume he isn't really)
[03:56:54] <johnkeats6> how could he, Maxwell did
[03:56:57] <johnkeats6> :-)
[03:58:04] <johnkeats6> not sure where to learn KG and Dirac from. i think P&S is valuable, but physicsy. Folland is pretty terse on that. Frankel i think strikes a nice balance for Dirac, but i'm not sure he mentions klein-gordon
[03:58:10] <johnkeats6> maybe a superposition of those 3
[03:58:11] <cherim> Why are you doing Peskin-Schroeder?  It's the sort of the things that I've been taught and expected to work on all my life but whenever I get some free will I always try to escape to more elegant stuff
[03:58:31] <cherim> Combinatorics or higher homotopy groups or literally anything else
[03:58:51] <johnkeats6> because i wanna know how nature works
[03:59:45] <buster> yep pretty much. more elegance on the same subject would be great
[04:00:14] <Fangs> its so interesting that physics seems to dominate this channel now, this is great

[04:01:34] <johnkeats6> there's no math physics in ##physics so here it is
[04:02:00] <cherim> Note that before Peskin-Schroeder was written we had to suffer with Bjorken-Drell (which was even not readily available in the libraries)
[04:02:05] <cherim> God forbid, Itzykson-Zuber

[04:02:45] <cherim> With a rare ray of light in terms of readability as Ryder
[04:03:06] <cherim> I think Bogolyubov is the worst of the bunch
[04:03:32] <cherim> So no warm memories from me on the topic
[04:04:14] <quantum> Frankel was my bible from second year onwards
[04:04:17] <johnkeats6> even today i don't know of any very good qft book. P&S is decent, but skips a lot of the calculations with no warning, and is also pretty physics-y
[04:04:54] <johnkeats6> my main source is folland, which is probably the best, but he's very terse sometimes and, like every good mathematician, detests examples
[04:05:31] <quantum> It isn't a book, but I'm supplementing Folland with a series of notes by Tong
[04:05:36] <quantum> https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/qft/qft.pdf
[04:06:03] <johnkeats6> yeah i do like tong. i wish he'd write the second notes, on renormalization 7 stuff

[08:27:05] <tusko> what is the trick to factoring Ax^3 +Bx^2 +Cx + D by hand?
[08:28:31] <tusko> I can usually factor Ax^2 + Bx + C by factoring with or without the quadratic formula, but then I can't do the same for higher degree like I get with a 3x3 matrix
[08:28:33] <Fangs> tusko: since its a degree 3 polynomial, if it factors into polynomial it has to either be of the form of deg 1 * deg 1 * deg 1 or deg 1 * deg 2
[08:29:08] <Fangs> so a way to do it is to find a root, and you're left with a quadratic
[08:29:35] <tusko> a root being something that divides into all 4 coefficients?
[08:29:43] <tusko> Sorry these just really always vex me
[08:29:46] <Fangs> no.. p(root) = 0
[08:29:55] <Fangs> if p is your polynomial

[08:31:02] <Fangs> tusko: well if theres some x0 so that p(x0) = 0, then p(x) = (x-x0)q(x) for some lower degree polynomial q
[08:31:57] <Fangs> are you just working with real numbers and complex numbers?
[08:32:05] <tusko> And how might I identify the case where it is p(x) = (x+x0)q(x)?
[08:32:15] <tusko> Mostly I'm working with real numbers today
[08:32:17] <Fangs> tusko: then -x0 is a root
[08:32:25] <tusko> I see, ok
[08:32:54] <tusko> Really I am working on better understanding the significance of diagonalization in linear algebra.
[08:33:21] <Fangs> tusko: that's best understood in the complex setting
[08:33:24] <tusko> So far I've identified that this means there is an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors, and we can factor A as PDP^(-1)

[08:33:56] <tusko> or maybe just orthogonal, but we could normalize the basis
[08:34:44] <Fangs> well in general, if you have eigenvectors and eigenvalues, you have: AP = DP where P are your eigenvectors and D contains your eigenvalues

[08:35:31] <int-e> Fangs: itym AP = PD
[08:35:38] <Fangs> thanks
[08:35:53] <Fangs> AP = PD
[08:35:56] <tusko> I believe you, it makes sense. I can sort of see it in my head
[08:36:15] <Fangs> tusko: so just up to this point, we need at least as many eigenvalues as there are dimension of A
[08:36:38] <tusko> sure, we have to have a basis for R^n, where n is the order of the matrix
[08:36:59] <Fangs> to diagonalize, you're just going to multiply everything on the left by P^{-1}
[08:37:05] <tusko> maybe order isn't the correct term there
[08:37:14] <Fangs> but that only exists if the eigenvectors are linearly independent
[08:37:49] <tusko> Ok, I understand, and this is due to the Invertible Matrix Thm
[08:37:57] <Fangs> yeah

[08:39:29] <tusko> I'm sure diagonalization is a very useful thing I just can't say exactly why. I think I recall some applications to probability
[08:39:48] <Fangs> well on one level its really easy to take powers of a diagonal matrix, and its eigenvalues etc
[08:40:15] <tusko> Right, A^x = PD^xP^(-1)
[08:40:17] <Fangs> tusko: on another level, the eigenbasis means your matrix A acts as a scalar multiplication on different axes
[08:40:46] <Fangs> think thats the two main reason why you like eigenvectors in general
[08:41:09] <tusko> that is to say P, applied to a matrix A is like scalar multiplication in each of n directions?
[08:41:43] <Fangs> A applied to P, rather
[08:41:52] *** Quits: i0e (~is0ke3@user/is0ke3) (Quit: Zzzzzz.....)
[08:42:37] <tusko> Of course, AP. And then would it be scalar multiplication by the given eigenvalue for each particular direction?
[08:42:58] <tusko> So if we had eigenvalues 1, 2, 3 it would stay the same on one axis, double on another, and triple on the other?
[08:43:32] <tusko> Or would it be like scalar multiplication by the same value along each axis?
[08:44:16] <Fangs> former
[08:44:24] <Fangs> the latter is only true if the eigvalues are all the same

[08:46:49] <Fangs> yeah
[08:47:25] <Fangs> tusko: if you have a finite group G, you can look at maps ("group homomorphisms") G -> GL(n,C) and take the trace

[08:50:10] <tusko> I can see it clearly in the whole linear operator thing
[08:50:30] <Fangs> idk if 'proven' is the correct word there, but the ideal of tangent space etc makes precise what they meant by 'linear approximation'

[11:46:04] <somiaj> kobalt: probably easier to compute the converse, what is the probablity that all six numbers don't appear.
[11:46:15] <somiaj> kobalt: so the probablity a 1 doesn't appear is (5/6)^8
[11:46:39] <somiaj> there are 6 different numbers, so the probablity that any number doesn't appear is 6*(5/6)^8
[11:46:43] <somiaj> now subtract that from 1

[11:53:26] <kobalt> newpy somiaj: So the probability that one of the number does not occurs is (5/6)^2 * (1/6)^6 * 8 ??
[11:54:22] <newpy> I think you messed up the math
[11:54:52] <somiaj> it is just 6*(5/6)^8 by my calculation. Pick a number, there is 5/6 a chance it doesn't occur on a single roll. Since the rolls are independent there is (5/6)^8 probablity it doesn't occur on any of the 8 rolls
[11:55:24] <somiaj> but that is for a single number, since there are 6 numbers that cannot occur, 6*(5/6)^8 is the probablity that not all 6 numbers are rolled
[11:56:53] <somiaj> actually those may not be disjoint, since there are possiblities that are the same that don't contain a 1 or a 2...I might be oversimplifying my computation

[12:01:06] <kobalt> using inclusion and exclusion principle?
[12:01:27] <newpy> no, (5/6)^8 is the chance of not rolling a 1 (for example)
[12:01:45] <somiaj> kobalt: I think that is more on the right track that my initial attempt
[12:01:52] <newpy> then you multiply it by 6 to account for not rolling a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6
[12:02:01] <newpy> oh?

Then you count the number of ways to arrange those *without* equal pairs. That's the 9!/(2!*2!) - 2*8!/2! + 7! part by the same logic we've been using.

[23:30:33] <drobi> I want to show that max(h1(x, a, b), h2(x, a, b)) >= l(x, a, b). The intersection of each of these are quartic in x, a, or b. There's a few nice things about these functions that allow me to beleive that I can do this using root analysis without actually solving the intersections. For instance both h1 and h2 go to infinity as x-> +inf and x->-inf, while l is bounded c1 < l < c2. So if there are ranges here
[23:30:39] <drobi> say h1 < l and these don
[23:30:53] <drobi> 't overlap with when h2 < l, then I can show the result.
