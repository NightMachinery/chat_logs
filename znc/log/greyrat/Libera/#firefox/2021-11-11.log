Long story short I thought I had a drive adapter to use to clone the old drive onto the new one, but I don't.  I kinda wanted to do a fresh ubuntu install anyway.  Only now I can't remember my firefox lgin.

[20:33:09] <vd> hi there -- I've seen that Firefox should be using the GPU soon. I'm wondering about memory amount. Is a 2GB graphics card enough to a few tabs (nothing funky) or are we talking much more memory?
[20:35:54] <vd> in other words, does someone already using FF with GPU know how much graphics card memory is being used?

[22:12:22] <octav1a> Does anyone else here have firefox nightly? I would appreciate if someone can try just the webGPU demo page after enabling webGPU and see if it works for them. https://webkit.org/demos/webgpu/hello-triangle.html
[22:12:38] <octav1a> I'm having issues and I want to see if it's just me.
