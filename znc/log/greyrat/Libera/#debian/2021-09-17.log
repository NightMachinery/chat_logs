[00:01:04] <Khepra> they probably won't. it's never about a single machine (unless targeted attack). yours will be added to botnets of tens of thousands, for their fun and profit.
[00:01:38] <Khepra> but nevermind. my whole point was that "private firewalled network" is false sense of security if things like a browser is run.
[00:01:40] <xingu> n4dir: it's your carefully curated collection of rare and irreplaceable catpix that they're really after; the music collection is just a cover story.

[15:22:09] <shtrb> If I wish to sandbox ff (from reading host/user files, interacting with local dbus) that need to access an evil website would firejail be enough or I should continue to sticking of using a vm ?
[15:22:19] <shtrb> *and fingerprinting my pc
[15:22:52] <PerfDave> Not sure what firejail is, but you might look at AppArmor
[15:23:34] <Haohmaru> ,i firejail
[15:23:35] <judd> Package firejail (utils, optional) in bullseye/amd64: sandbox to restrict the application environment. Version: 0.9.64.4-2; Size: 356.9k; Installed: 1370k; Homepage: https://firejail.wordpress.com
[15:23:50] <Khepra> shtrb: firejail should do the work if you also do some unix ownership isolations. AppArmor is a very good tool too. I run FF as anotehr user (to completely remove any access to my ~/ ), and under an appArmor profile
[15:23:53] <shtrb> firejail is a similar tool to apparmor, but I'm not sure how an AppArmor could help here
[15:24:10] <Khepra> it's not that similar. firejail relies on namespacing. AA is a MAC framework
[15:24:29] <Khepra> you can put a MAC policy onto a namespaced resource, they're orthogonal
[15:25:09] <shtrb> Khepra, does your apparmor profile block dbus communiction too ?
[15:25:11] <Khepra> shtrb: you will however have a problem... any uploads would first require you to copy the file into allowed location, and also in reverse if you use different system user to run FF
[15:25:30] <shtrb> Khepra, I'm ok with that (I'm using a vm for that for now)
[15:25:38] <Khepra> shtrb: nope, in fact I use dbus-session abstraction
[15:26:02] <Khepra> but, just don't include it and dbus is disallowed
[15:26:47] *** Joins: Peanut (~paul@user/peanut)
[15:27:08] <shtrb> Khepra, I already heard that dbus can be used to fingerprint (and interact with other tools installed on the pc) so I'm trying to cover that front too.
[15:27:14] <Khepra> problem with FF in your regular ~/  (not running as different user) is that you HAVE to give it access to your own fontconfigs and other things. nvidia configs too if you use that and want accel.  I wasn't comfortable with that, so I run as a completely separate user
[15:27:31] <Khepra> shtrb: it can, but not outside of polkit policies

[15:28:35] <Khepra> ultimately I intend to switch to a wayland compositor (from i3-wm to sway) and remove the xorg insecurity altogether. though for random browsing I intend to also use a VM

[15:36:44] <Khepra> shtrb: for extra extra security, you can use a VM, isolated under AppArmor, as well. it doesn't protect against ring0 exploits, but it will prevent any code executions in context of the running qemu-kvm process, which is a substantial layer of protection. on RHEL clones, libvirt has a tight SELinux policy.

[15:44:33] <Khepra> but you're onto something. with big ARM backbones hosting dozens numa isolated cores, and some hypervisor support, you can put each application in a very, very isolated environment. qubesOS might take advantage of such a setup.

[15:59:48] <Khepra> no you have to copy it to /etc/apparmor.d/
[16:00:14] <shtrb> so it's even better :) no default ff profile at all :D
[16:00:19] <Khepra> problem with AA profiles is that they're... unfinished really and not globally applicable out of the box, except the few defautls installed by the main apparmor packge
[16:00:45] <Khepra> in addition, some packages bring their own profiles directly into /etc/apparmor.d/ so you can't audit them all by listing from a single package. notable example: thunderbird and its' AA related bugs
[16:01:04] <Khepra> for me, I love AA because it's very easy to simply develop profiles from scratch, unlike with selinux

[18:00:30] <norg> Hi, does anyone know a tool/parameter to debug a very slow "Loading initial Ramdisk"? Adding debug to grub only affects the logs after it was loaded.
[18:00:55] <norg> We upgraded systems from buster-backports 5.10 kernel to bullseye 5.10 and see a huge slowdown with the same settings and would like to debug the root cause
[18:01:15] <norg> setting modules=dep in the initramfs helps but wasn't necessary with buster initrd
[18:01:15] <shtrb> jelly, what does that sign mean
[18:01:17] <Khepra> norg: did the initramfs image grow in size, substantially?
[18:01:34] <norg> Khepra: nope, the size is ~32MB on both systems
[18:01:38] <jelly> shtrb, duck
[18:01:55] <snoot> cat /sys/module/usbhid/parameters/mousepoll
[18:01:58] <norg> even the 8MB (with modules=dep instead of most) is still a bit slower compared to the 5.10 from backports
[18:02:00] <snoot> oops
[18:02:52] <Khepra> norg: I don't think there's debug hooks for something like that. except dmesg. check the timestamps and see where's huge increases
[18:02:53] <norg> systemd-analyze time is nearly the same as well, so we did pinpoint that it must have something to do with the pure initrd
[18:03:17] <norg> the dmesg output doesn't differ, it covers around 5-10s on both
[18:03:18] *** Joins: Highlander (~Highlande@user/highlander)

[18:04:27] <jelly> that's done before control is passed to Linux, so you won't see anything there
[18:04:32] <Khepra> actually it's the kernel; it has to decompress it and have support for the compression
[18:04:43] <jelly> orly
[18:05:07] <Khepra> afaik grub only passes the initrd location to the kernel; but I'm sure the kernel does the cpio decompression, tmpfs and exec of /bin/init
[18:05:12] <norg> we also tried disabling microcodes and updateing bios, but no real diff
[18:05:39] <norg> while we thought setting to modules=dep would mean some slow modules are the reason, it can also be misleading
[18:05:49] <norg> since it might just be that a smaller initrd is just read faster
[18:06:03] <ansgar> norg: Maybe it uses a different compression strength? Though that mostly makes compression slower, not sure how much decompression changes.
[18:06:10] <Khepra> that's why I suggested to check dmesg timestamps, modules=dep would affect initramfs "scripts" execution time, and modules loading/testing would be clearly visible in dmesg timestamps
[18:06:18] <norg> ansgar: still gzip
[18:06:53] <norg> Khepra: that would second my idea that it's not the modules but just the smaller initrd
[18:07:05] <Khepra> (btw, as a side note, I'm very pleased with kernel 5.14 new feature where it always logs Firmware loaded; I hope this trickles down to 5.10 by upstream)

[18:09:06] <norg> was just something we saw on posts that we tried

[22:22:39] <DHE> it's a hack to make the "unprovisioned space" on an SSD appear larger than it normally would be, which is to the advantage of wear leveling
[22:24:28] <NatalieTheTiny> I'm trying to setup mouse support for the terminal (I'm not running a GUI), and have managed to get things working with gpm. My laptop has a ALPS Dualpoint touchpad, and what I want to do is disable to tap-to-click. Any suggestions on how I can do that?
[22:25:01] <NatalieTheTiny> When googling, there were a lot of hints towards using tpconfig, but it looks like that's been pulled from the debian repos.

[22:28:00] <sney> tharkun: also, concerns about ssd lifespan were a big deal with early hardware, but modern (read: post-2014 or so) disks will last for years with defaults.
[22:29:07] <sney> unless you're doing something really destructive with huge frequent writes, it's unlikely that leaving a bunch of space inaccessible to the OS will net you any meaningful benefits
[22:31:24] <tharkun> I think I used terms wrongly. All articles made the comment that having a single partition made the ssd last even longer due to writes being done all over the disk a minimal number of times. Sorry if I mislead anyone on my poorly written question.
[22:32:11] <tharkun> sney: Writting to the disk is although frequent, there are serveral k's of files being written per week.
[22:32:28] <sney> that's typical usage.

[22:49:29] <Khepra> tharkun: the SSD doesn't use linear addressing like a HDD with "outer" and "inner" parts of the platter. so if you leave some space for "unused" it's not geometrically the same as leaving, say, inner parts of HDD platters unused by partitioning to less that available size
[22:49:48] <Khepra> so as long as you trim and not fill up the disk to the brim, you're golden.
[22:52:07] <Khepra> and even if you leave some space unpartioned, that doesn't actually exist except as a scalar number. eventually all the cells will be written to, due to wear levelling algorithms. so you'd be wasting space for no practical gain.
[22:55:24] <jelly> the general idea is to give those wear levelling algorithms more space to deal with
[22:55:50] <jelly> because firmware knows which LBAs have never been used
[22:55:55] <Khepra> yes, so you trim often (firmware marks cells unused, so the algos know what's usable) and don't fill it up to the brim
[22:56:45] <tharkun> Khepra: Thanks.

[23:07:57] <jelly> I guess mesa and drm are pretty isolated and one could TECHNICALLY build something like ubuntu's hwe stack but for Debian
