[00:21:03] <TeRRoR_MuDa> how do i get debian to update weechat on their repos?
[00:21:13] <TeRRoR_MuDa> or do i really need to wait for the next stable release?
[00:21:58] <PerfDave> TeRRoR_MuDa: What do you mean by "their repos" and what is the update you have in mind?
[00:22:08] <PerfDave> !stable
[00:22:08] <dpkg> [stable] The status of a Debian release when no packages will be added or version-bumped, and changes will only fix security issues and critical bugs. Packages can be removed in rare circumstances. The current stable version of Debian is Bullseye (11.x); ask me about <releases>. Security bugs are fixed in stable by backporting the fix to the stable version (ask me about <security backports>). https://wiki.debian.org/DebianStable
[00:22:37] <TeRRoR_MuDa> like the latest version of weechat is 3.4
[00:22:40] <TeRRoR_MuDa> and im stuck on 3.0
[00:22:54] <greycat> ,v weechat
[00:22:55] <judd> Package: weechat on amd64 -- stretch: 1.6-1+deb9u2; stretch-backports: 2.3-1~bpo9+1; buster: 2.3-1; buster-proposed-updates: 2.3-1+deb10u1; buster-backports: 2.8-1~bpo10+1; bullseye: 3.0-1; bullseye-proposed-updates: 3.0-1+deb11u1; bookworm: 3.4-2; sid: 3.4-2
[00:23:13] <TeRRoR_MuDa> i would have to go outside of debian stable to get the latest but i dont want to since it compromises my FOSS philosophy
[00:23:19] <greycat> It'll be in the next release.  If you personally need it sooner, you can build it yourself.
[00:23:21] <TeRRoR_MuDa> which is getting everything in house
[00:23:38] <TeRRoR_MuDa> ok greycat thats what i figured.
[00:23:39] <PerfDave> TeRRoR_MuDa: You could backport it yourself
[00:24:05] <TeRRoR_MuDa> perfdave sadly will need to wait for the next debian drop.
[00:24:15] <TeRRoR_MuDa> i know why im on debian stable lol. my arch habits are showing.
[00:24:26] <somiaj> !ssb
[00:24:26] <dpkg> First, check for a backport on <debian-backports>.  If unavailable: 1) Add a deb-src line for sid (not a deb line!); ask me about <deb-src sid> 2) enable debian-backports (see <bdo>) 3) apt update; apt install build-essential; apt build-dep packagename 4) apt -b source packagename 5) dpkg -i packagename-ver.deb  To change compilation options, see <package recompile>; for versions newer than sid see <uupdate>.
[00:25:01] <TeRRoR_MuDa> somiaj im going to save that text
[00:25:03] <greycat> ,checkbackport weechat
[00:25:05] <somiaj> TeRRoR_MuDa: there are fairly safe ways to get newer versions of specific software in debian stable. Just have to make sure you do it properly, i.e. build your own package.
[00:25:25] <judd> Backporting package weechat in sid→bullseye/amd64: unsatisfiable build dependencies: Build-Depends: debhelper-compat (= 13).
[00:25:28] <PerfDave> If you wanted to, you could contribute a backport: https://backports.debian.org/Contribute/
[00:25:31] <TeRRoR_MuDa> ah somiaj if i did that i would update with confidence.
[00:25:46] <greycat> Looks like building a backport might require some extra steps (see judd's output above)
[00:25:47] <TeRRoR_MuDa> i just hated to going through weird websites where im not sure if my system is being compromised
[00:25:50] <somiaj> Note, this does mean you become responsible for any security updates, but for a few packages here and there it is just fine.
[00:26:04] <somiaj> greycat: judd doesn't deal with virtual packages, debhelper-compat = 13 is in bullseye
[00:26:08] <somiaj> ,v debhelper
[00:26:09] <judd> Package: debhelper on amd64 -- stretch: 10.2.5; stretch-backports: 12.1.1~bpo9+1; buster: 12.1.1; buster-backports: 13.3.3~bpo10+1; bullseye: 13.3.4; bookworm: 13.6; sid: 13.6

[00:29:47] <somiaj> well about
[00:30:25] <TeRRoR_MuDa> yea doing my research on all those links you posted before i decide if its worth going through with it.

[06:18:08] <nevoyu> say what is the difference when I call "apt upgrade" vs "apt dist-upgrade" anyway? I'm on bookworm right now and I don't really know which I should be using.
[06:20:41] <somiaj> the manual page for apt-get explains the difference between the two
[06:20:55] <somiaj> also bookworm support is in #debian-next on irc.oftc.net
[06:21:31] <sney> for general usage on a single release, you should be using apt upgrade, and if apt is in a condition where it needs an extra push then you can try apt full-upgrade (aka dist-upgrade).
[06:21:52] <nevoyu> ah okok
[06:21:58] <nevoyu> somiaj: ok
[06:24:23] <somiaj> the differnce is basically if apt is allowed to remove packages to satsifies dependencies during upgrades

[07:06:27] <maxtim> I have a cronjob that rsyncs via ssh to a debian server. After success, however, I can no longer access that server via ssh. It still replies to pings. I usually end up just hard rebooting the device to restore it. How can I fix this?

[07:10:37] <maxtim> somiaj, i didn't know about the -vvv flag. It hangs after 'Connection established' (identity files and then `Local version string....`)
[07:14:09] <greycat> you're saying that you reboot the *client*?  and this makes it work?
[07:14:22] <maxtim> greycat, no the host
[07:15:24] <greycat> so you can ssh to this server precisely one time, per boot?
[07:15:37] <greycat> the obvious thing to do would be to look at the logs while it's in the failing state
[07:16:15] <maxtim> greycat, oh no. I can ssh to it any number of times. It's after a successful rsync does it seem to freeze up
[07:18:31] <greycat> if you already *had* an ssh shell session open to the server, does this session continue working after the "freeze"?
[07:18:57] <greycat> is there any way you can read logs or run commands on the server after the "freeze" to try to figure out what's happening?
[07:19:14] <maxtim> i haven't tried that. Not without a reboot
[07:19:41] <greycat> are there other network services (SMTP, FTP?) and do those also "freeze"?
[07:20:28] <greycat> if you fire up a second instance of sshd on a second port, does that one also "freeze" at the same time as the first one?  (that will require some setup, most likely)
[07:20:55] *** Joins: luke-jr (~luke-jr@user/luke-jr)

[07:36:17] <somiaj> !non-free sources
[07:36:17] <dpkg> Edit /etc/apt/sources.list, ensure that the two main Debian mirror lines end with "main contrib non-free" rather than just "main", then «apt-get update».  But bear in mind that you'll be installing <non-free> software.  These may have onerous terms; check the licenses.  See also <sources.list>.
[07:36:22] <n-iCe> somiaj:  could be
[07:36:37] <n-iCe> I tried nonfree netinstall but asked for firmwares anyway
[07:37:05] <somiaj> did ask or just give you a warning, that warnig may not mean that firmware wasn't found
[07:37:23] <somiaj> many devices can use multiple firmware files, and that warning says some file wasn't found, but doesn't actually say if some other file was loaded correctly
[07:37:30] <n-iCe> somiaj:  asked me to use an external device
[07:38:00] <somiaj> well that is what it does for any missing firmware file, what I said above still holds
[07:38:53] <n-iCe> anyway, installed normal iso
[07:39:00] <n-iCe> package was installed, thank you.
[07:39:18] <n-iCe> tried modprobe -r iwlwifi ; modprobe iwlwifi but did not load it.
[07:39:23] <n-iCe> guess have to log out?
[07:41:49] <greycat> !iwlwifi
[07:41:49] <dpkg> The iwlwifi Linux kernel driver supports several Intel 802.11n (WiFi Link, Wireless-N, Advanced-N, Ultimate-N) and 802.11ac adapters.  Firmware is required, ask me about <non-free sources> and install the firmware-iwlwifi package to provide.  Supported devices and troubleshooting hints are listed at https://wiki.debian.org/iwlwifi .  See also <iwlegacy>, <iwl7000>.
[07:42:49] <greycat> If you just built a kernel module, and updated the initramfs image, you'll probably want to reboot to get it loaded.  It's not a module.
[07:43:06] <greycat> err... wait, I'm mixing things up a bit

[15:06:10] <Khepra> if you reconfigure and rebuild the package. why would you wanna waste your time like that, tho?
[15:06:28] <Khepra> if you want to _block_ it from being loaded, it's easy to do so via modprobe blacklists
[15:06:53] <Khepra> (or the other way around, via /etc/modules whitelist, which requires cmdline option to enable it)
[15:08:49] <Affliction> and, if we're getting to this point, why xfs in particular? what about the other hundreds of modules that are compiled in or dynamically loaded that you may never use? :)

[15:16:19] <rendar> Khepra, wait, in /etc/modprobe.d there is a file blackilisting xfs already
[15:16:25] <rendar> why it didn't?
[15:17:38] <Khepra> it could be a typo or wrong syntax, or the module could've been brought in as dependency. afaik, modprobe blacklist only blocks direct module load, but I'm not sure of that
[15:17:56] <Khepra> lsmod will show you if another module requires it
[15:19:06] <Khepra> also note if you have xfs loaded, that means the kernel detected xfs filesystems and loaded the module(s). or you have an explicit load somewhere, /etc/modules perhaps
[15:19:29] <Khepra> I still don't understand why would you want to do this, and also why stop there as Affliction suggested
[15:22:21] <rendar> checking at dmesg, https://bpa.st/WDKQ -- it seems it loaded xfs and brtfs drivers on-demand, after boot, right?
[15:22:25] <rendar> check at the timings there
[15:23:27] <Khepra> rendar: does your lsmod show xfs loaded, and what's in the "used by" column?

[15:48:26] <rendar> now that i have uninstalled this os-prober, everything seems to work right
[15:49:53] <Khepra> I guess you either run it manually, or update-grub did.... https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/amd64/os-prober/filelist
[15:50:26] <rendar> i see
[15:50:38] <rendar> nope, i didn't run it manually
[15:50:46] <rendar> i didn't even know that package
[15:51:00] <jelly> what DID you run?
[15:51:18] <Khepra> then update-grub did. which could also be triggered by kernel package installation, or somethign else retriggering grub
[15:51:42] <rendar> jelly, nothing! only logged into the machine!
[15:51:45] * jelly is triggered
[15:51:56] <rendar> i made an apt-get update && upgrade this morning
[15:51:57] <rendar> nothng more
[15:52:09] <Khepra> rendar: and did that upgrade pull in the recent kernel upgrade?
[15:52:11] <jelly> rendar, you just opened a root shell, and then ran nothing in it at all?
[15:52:18] <rendar> Khepra, yes!
[15:52:22] <Khepra> so that's it then
[15:52:22] <rendar> i did it on purpose
[15:52:28] <rendar> to avoid that dirtypipe bug
[15:52:58] <jelly> a kernel package installation or upgrade triggers update-grub
[15:53:04] <Khepra> so you saw the logs and wasn't sure what cause them modules to load, and then you went through the rabbit hole with 3.7 yaks shaved, to find out..... this is all just a consequence of update-grub :)
[15:53:07] <jelly> that's it
[15:53:18] <rendar> :)
[15:53:19] <rendar> i see
[15:53:44] <rendar> but the thing i can't get, why update-grub should trigger that os-probe thing?
[15:53:47] <jelly> new kernel, to be able to boot, needs to add itself to the boot loader
[15:53:59] <rendar> and, now that i have uninstalled it, i can do update-grub without worries, right?
[15:53:59] <Khepra> but you said "blocklist didn't work" which would imply you ran the modprobe blacklist and then you rebooted, and then.... what happened after reboot? it got run again?
[15:54:32] <jelly> rendar, the boot loader is able to add entries for other OS-es.  os-prober detects other OS installations on disks, if there are any
[15:54:55] <rendar> Khepra, nope, after rebooting without os-probe, it didn't load anymore xfs and other blacklisted things
[15:55:08] <jelly> to be able to detect OSes it needs to read what's on filesystems
[15:55:30] <rendar> Khepra, running that command, says: https://bpa.st/VWRA
[15:55:42] <Khepra> rendar: I don't mean without os-probe.   I'm just trying to figure out _when_ did os-prober run exactly, if you blacklisted and rebooted, there should be no reason for it to run _after_ reboot unless you re-run update-grub manually

Also, are you comparing the same things? are you comparing same versions, in same context (Same services running in the bg), same filesystems and same hardware?
[16:59:43] <Khepra> I would say you're not, if you compare debian to BSDs. you're comparing apples and oranges. not only different versions of software and likely filesystems (unless you ZFS on both) but the kernel metric is entirely different.

[17:02:49] <kee> Mellowlink: Same kernel?
[17:03:12] <kee> If not (and it's not), it could well be that the CPU% number means something different.
[17:03:17] <Khepra> Mellowlink: different kernels, different sofware versions. you have so many differences, you cannot possibly make a meaningful comparison.
[17:03:37] <kee> Does the CPU's temperature go up by the same amount on both OSs?
[17:03:41] <Mellowlink> void is 5.15 but i have that install since it used to be 5.4. i don't think kernel version has much impact on desktop responsiveness
[17:03:57] <Khepra> it may or may not have
[17:04:08] <kee> You're not talking about desktop responsiveness, though; you're talking about 5% CPU. Is the responsiveness also affected?
[17:04:11] <Khepra> if your gpu is intel, or amdgpu  it definitely has.
[17:04:31] <Khepra> and how do you measure "responsiveness"?
[17:04:36] <Mellowlink> kee: yes it is affected.
[17:04:43] <Khepra> by what metric?
[17:05:41] <kee> The Windows metric: how long does the mouse cursor take to respond to the movement of the hardware mouse? (Windows has the fastest boot times of any OS, because it loads the mouse cursor first.)
[17:06:00] <Mellowlink> void/freebsd being instant while debian 11 has like 0.5s delay when spawning/closing a suckless terminal
