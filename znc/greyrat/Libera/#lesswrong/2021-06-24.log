[05:20:14] <quanticle> Yep. My project this week has been to query a bunch of government ArcGIS servers to automatically calculate whether a given solar/wind project proposal intersects things like "critical habitat" or "protected wetlands"
[05:20:26] <quanticle> And "jurisdictional waters", whatever those are
[05:23:55] <Logos01> My understanding of the term "jurisdictional waters" is anything within 200 miles of the coastline of a country?
[05:24:31] <gwern> Logos01: that looks... pretty arbitrary

[05:25:11] <kuudes> "no fireworks on wetlands" or something?
[05:25:37] <Logos01> Oh I'm very wrong.
[05:25:50] <quanticle> kuudes: Well, I don't know what the rules are for Logos01's map; I was just talking about something I was doing for work.
[05:25:59] <Logos01> gwern: The lines in the Riverton/South-Jordan area are unmanaged waterways.
[05:26:20] <Logos01> kuudes: The rules are: "The executive branch head for the area in question decided to ban it there."
[05:26:43] <Logos01> The lines in the Riverton/South-Jordan area for example are unmanaged canals and creeks.
[05:27:24] <Logos01> There has been no clear coordination on the parts of the mayors of the various incorporated cities of the Metropolitan SLC area on this topic.
[05:27:33] <Logos01> quanticle: So I was wrong about the jurisdictional waters thing.
[05:27:49] <Logos01> But the basic logic *IS* ... largely self-consistent.

This new definition has fundamental...)
[05:28:09] <Logos01> "Waters of the United States" is a rather hilarious "#OTUS" though.
[05:29:20] <Betawolf> FLOTUS on WOTUS
[05:29:40] <Logos01> quanticle: So basically if you think "the naturally occurring water-cycle bodies in US territory" that's a largely accurate assessment.
[05:30:01] <Logos01> Like, artificial lakes aren't WOTUS unless they're made by damming a creek.
[05:30:29] <quanticle> Natural streams and basins more or less
[05:30:29] <Logos01> But canals that conect two rivers *are*, I think.
[05:30:42] <quanticle> Also *sometimes* wetlands
[05:30:44] <Logos01> Emphasis on the "more or less"
[05:30:53] <quanticle> Depends on how hippie the current President is
[05:32:05] <Logos01> Literally.
[05:32:16] <Logos01> The definition has fluctuated by presidency.
[05:32:42] <Logos01> I *WAS* correct that it does include the "territorial seas" though.
[05:33:45] <quanticle> Yeah, I vaguely remember Trump reversing some Obama era rule on WOTUS
[05:34:34] <Logos01> The major change if I understand this article is that the old rule included pretty much any open body of water that was identifiable in affecting the "ecological health" of any other body of water that was already part of WOTUS.
[05:36:51] <Logos01> I mean it *makes sense* for there to be federal jurisdiction over the watercycle as there's pretty much no way for most rivers to avoid crossing state lines (especially in terms of the flow-terminus of any volume of water passing through said river).
[05:37:02] <Logos01> But damn if that definition isn't cumbersome as shit.
[05:37:16] <Logos01> I'm reminded of an adage about defining theft.
[05:38:06] <Logos01> The only people interested in a clear definition of what counts as stealing apples from an apple tree are people interested in stealing apples from an apple tree.

[08:03:59] <PlanckWalk> I'm pretty sure that matching one regex consisting of 600 small regexps or-ed together takes at least as much time as doing 600 individual regexps.
[08:05:15] <gwern> PlanckWalk: the idea is that it can optimize them together to skip maximal numbers of sub-regexes and short-circuit as early as possible, while also avoiding the overhead of 600+ calls
[08:06:00] <PlanckWalk> Right, in principle it doesn't have to, but I bet it does in practice.
[08:06:12] <CoJaBo> PlanckWalk: Depends on the regex lib lol; there's some where it's many thousands of times faster, because the call is very expensive. So you end up with regexps that are hilariously long =D
[08:06:25] <PlanckWalk> (If you precompile the regexps at least)
[08:07:05] <CoJaBo> I maintain an app that has several gigs of precompiled regexps
[08:07:20] <PlanckWalk> Ah.  That is a lot.
[08:07:28] <rmmh> yeah it depends entirely on the regex library
[08:07:53] <rmmh> most regex engines have /literal/ optimizations, *some* of them will extend that to /ored|literals|together/

[10:53:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> Jayson_Virissimo: Man, your company seems like it'd be a pretty decent place to work (and mattresses are clearly a more useful thing to work on than "disrupting the cloud crypto blockchain with machine learning" or w/e the latest startup is), but wow, I can hardly think of two web technologies I'd like to work with *less* than Rails and React ... :p 
[10:53:44] <quanticle> "Chemacs2 is a bootloader for Emacs. It allows you to switch between multiple Emacs configurations. Here is a quick guide for setting it up with Doom Emacs as the default config"
[10:53:49] <quanticle> Because of course there is
[10:53:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> Jayson_Virissimo: I wish you luck in your search though
[10:53:58] <quanticle> Every good OS needs a bootloader, after all
[10:54:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: lol
[10:55:07] <Jayson_Virissimo> Obormot\Arcturus: At first, I was really into both, and then they seemed sorta boring, but now I'm back to really loving Rails again. Very little drama/hidden sharp edges.
[10:55:10] <quanticle> Okay, doom emacs looks sufficiently complicated to set up that I don't think I'll be abandoning my current spacemacs-based approach
[10:55:28] <quanticle> I guess... (re: Rails)
[10:55:50] <quanticle> I dunno, I never liked the "convention over configuration" approach that (G)Rails takes
[10:56:35] <quanticle> Convention over configuration is great... until you have to debug and then you're stuck in a labyrinth of twisty magic methods
[10:57:28] <quanticle> It feels too much like programming-by-coincidence to me
[10:57:45] <feep[work]> do it riiight
[10:58:16] <feep[work]> quanticle: like, you think convention is twisty, wait till you try to read the startup of a program configured explicitly
[10:58:34] <feep[work]> at least convention is straight calls with hopefully informatively named parameters
[10:58:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> Is it, though
[10:58:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> (It's not)
[10:58:45] <feep[work]> it is if you do it right
[10:58:53] <feep[work]> my argument is "if you do it right, convention beats configuration"
[10:58:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> Clearly, then, Rails does it wrong :p
[10:58:55] <Jayson_Virissimo> Maybe that explains the cycles. Wow, very fast to add new features because magic -> eh, this is too much magic, how do I debug -> I now understand how it's implemented, so it doesn't seem like magic, but is still fast to dev
[10:59:12] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: this does not surprise me :p
[10:59:27] <quanticle> At least I *can* read the startup of an explicitly configured program. I might have to jump between fourteen different source files and eight different XML documents, but at least there's a thread there for me to follow. As opposed to, "Why does this get called?" "Oh because I gave it a special name." What is this? Harry Potter magic?
[10:59:51] <feep[work]> quanticle: ... okay tbf, I'm defending the way we here where I work do convention vs configuration, and uh
[11:00:00] <feep[work]> I assure you we do NOT call methods because they have a special name :P
[11:00:25] <feep[work]> in fact I tried to push us towards "explicit startup" as much as possible
[11:00:58] <feep[work]> barring extremely strong justification, things should get called because something explicitly calls them
[11:01:11] <quanticle> Well, that's what Rails does. And, more offensive to me is the way that ActiveRecord uses Ruby's missing_method to allow to write your queries in the names of methods that you call on model classes.
[11:01:21] <feep[work]> just how barring strong justification, classes should have the types of their objects 
[11:01:39] <feep[work]> quanticle: ... hax
[11:02:25] <feep[work]> quanticle: generally my thinking is, "the higher level, the less magic". ie. I'm okay with magic at the very low level, network send/receive, rpc calls, serialization
[11:02:36] <quanticle> Types lmao, this is Ruby. Types are... at best a strong suggestion. Look, if the type isn't doing what you want, just monkey patch until it does!
[11:02:40] <feep[work]> lol
[11:03:04] <feep[work]> anyway, the point I'm trying to make is really just
[11:03:12] <feep[work]> "convention over configuration isn't shit"
[11:03:15] <feep[work]> "*ruby* is shit"
[11:03:37] <feep[work]> well, really, rails is shit
[11:03:38] <quanticle> Like, sure, I'll admit that convention over configuration works... in the presence of a strong type system and a type checker that tells you ahead of time when you've fucked up
[11:03:41] <feep[work]> ruby is a fine scripting language
[11:03:44] <quanticle> But Ruby doesn't have that
[11:04:03] <Jayson_Virissimo> Honestly, I'd still choose Ruby for prototyping a web app, even now.
[11:04:11] <feep[work]> no love for py?
[11:04:31] <feep[work]> Jayson_Virissimo: go full metal. go bash. STRING INTERPOLATE ALL THE THINGS
[11:04:32] <Jayson_Virissimo> Only if I need some kind of stats package or something.
[11:04:52] <feep[work]> don't you love RCEs in your actual script interpreter
[11:05:29] <Jayson_Virissimo> Wife will kill me if I don't go to bed soon.
[11:05:38] <feep[work]> sleep, one way or another
[11:05:51] <feep[work]> might as well comf
[11:06:00] <quanticle> Yeah, prototyping is fine. Rails is great when it's Friday and you need a fully functioning CMS with user management, a shopping cart, and inventory control by Monday morning.
[11:06:17] <quanticle> The problem is that... Ruby sites tend to bitrot quickly, in my experience.
[11:06:21] <Jayson_Virissimo> Feel free to spread that job listing if you know anyone who isn't a snob
[11:06:28] <Jayson_Virissimo> about CoC

[11:07:15] <feep[work]> heh
[11:07:23] <feep[work]> me: "CoC" my brain: "madoka/fate crossover?"
[11:07:31] <feep[work]> me: "okay, brain, you're gonna have to explain that one"
[11:08:00] <feep[work]> brain: "RoR = Ruby on Rails, so CoC = Cruby on crails = kyubey on grails"
[11:08:08] <feep[work]> me: "... I hate that you're right"
[11:08:15] <quanticle> Oh yeah, don't get me wrong, I'm not *that* much of a hater of Ruby. I'm sure it's possible to do Ruby well. It's just that Ruby, right now, is at that phase where there are substantial number of legacy intranet sites built with... usually by contractors/consultants who were riding the Ruby wave when it was hot and have moved on to Javascript/NodeJS, leaving poor maintenance programmers to pick
[11:08:17] <quanticle> up their half-finished undocumented prototypes and keep them running.
[11:08:37] <quanticle> Oh, hey's gone, welp
[11:08:47] <adiabatic> I still care about others' opinions on RoR
[11:09:11] <adiabatic> I want to like it but I'm not at the point where the magic is a net plus
[11:09:16] <feep[work]> I still think convention should *not* extend to function calls
[11:09:20] <feep[work]> ever
[11:09:49] <quanticle> Agreed. If Rails just got rid of its missing_method abuse, it's be a lot easier to debug.
[11:10:45] <PlanckWalk> CoC obviously stands for Call of Cthulhu
[11:12:17] <PlanckWalk> ... which fits the theme of losing sanity while plumbing the depths of web applications that take convention-over-configuration rather too far.
[11:13:40] <adiabatic> I'm familar with the practice of "the root object can decide what to do when a method is called on an object that doesn't have that method"‚Ä¶
[11:14:03] <adiabatic> but how's it used in Rails? Generating methods that can't be looked up in an IDE?
[11:14:04] *** Quits: [itchyjunk] (~itchyjunk@user/itchyjunk/x-7353470) (Quit: Leaving)
[11:14:22] <quanticle> Yes, specifically ActiveRecord (which is Rails' ORM).
[11:14:33] <quanticle> Look at how ActiveRecord does queries on model objects.
[11:15:49] <adiabatic> for 90% of the time all these probably-method calls look like bare function calls to me
[11:16:04] <adiabatic> that's another thing I don't like about R(oR)
[11:17:00] <PapuaHardyNet> what
[11:17:23] <PapuaHardyNet> I'm not sure how you went from ruby on rails to kyubey on grails
[11:17:43] <PapuaHardyNet> perhaps you think in words, which is why I find it very strange while it may be natural for you
[11:17:52] <feep[work]> ^^
[11:17:59] <feep[work]> PapuaHardyNet: yeah you have to slur "cruby on crails" a bit
[11:18:13] <feep[work]> the r is the biggest stretch
[11:19:02] <feep[work]> but it's the sort of thing where if you say it sort of halfway, you can hear it either way depending on subtitles, so it counts imo
[11:21:01] <quanticle> adiabatic: Yep, that's what really annoyed me. User.find_by_username_and_password(username, password) is a method that doesn't exist. Instead it uses activerecord's dynamic matching to parse the columms that it should query... from the *method name*
[11:21:17] <quanticle> Which, when I first saw it, caused internal screaming
[11:21:30] <adiabatic> Oh, God.
[11:21:30] <feep[work]> ............
[11:21:36] * feep[work] bluescreens
[11:21:47] <quanticle> https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html#label-Dynamic+attribute-based+finders <-- right there in the docs, friendos
[11:21:49] <Robomot> ActiveRecord::Base (Active Record  Active Record objects don't specify their attributes directly, but rather infer them from the table definition with which they're linked.)
[11:21:56] <adiabatic> I wonder if there's a Rubocop cop that says "don't do that"
[11:22:37] <quanticle> "It's possible to add an exclamation point (!) on the end of the dynamic finders to get them to raise an ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound error if they do not return any records, like Person.find_by_last_name!"
[11:22:42] <quanticle> Oh god, I did not know this
[11:22:46] <quanticle> And I regret having learned it
[11:22:55] <feep[work]> that's ... that's not even consistent with ruby
[11:23:00] <adiabatic> what's wrong with that sort of‚Ä¶oh
[11:23:10] <adiabatic> Isn't ! for mutating methods?
[11:23:13] <feep[work]> stdlib convention is method! mutates the lhs
[11:23:15] <feep[work]> yeah
[11:24:02] <feep[work]> I mean like -- what the fuck is wrong with find(last_name: param['last_name'])
[11:24:23] <feep[work]> what was so horrible about that syntax, that you had to go to these lengths
[11:26:19] <adiabatic> do I need to dig out ggreer's animoji of him saying "just because you could something something didn't stop to think if you should"
[11:31:45] <quanticle> feep: The funny thing is, ActiveRecord *totally* supports your syntax too. User.find_by(lastname: input_field) is just as valid as User.find_by_lastname(input_field). Yet, in the two or three actual Rails codebases I've seen, it's always been the second syntax used, not the first.
[11:32:05] <adiabatic> I see lots of the former
[11:32:21] <quanticle> Okay, well, maybe the Ruby community grew up
[11:32:34] <quanticle> Admittedly, the last Ruby codebase I saw was about 6 years ago
[11:34:24] <feep[work]> admittedly, and I realize I should have said this earlier, I don't know shit bout rails
[11:34:32] <feep[work]> :p
[11:34:56] <feep[work]> I'm really just here to defend convention because I like it (in our non-rails static typed language)
[11:35:14] *** Joins: tex (~super@user/dix)
[11:47:05] <quanticle> Yeah, I don't have as much of a problem with convention in statically typed languages, because I know that if I type something completely nonsensical, I'll get an error from the compiler.
[11:47:17] <quanticle> Whereas in Ruby, I'll just get an empty result set
[11:47:19] <feep[work]> good old read error print loop
[11:48:34] <nshepperd2> the last time i saw a RoR codebase was years ago, but i hate it to this day. Nothing meant anything, or existed. If there was an identifier you didn't know you couldn't just go to its definition or look it up online, because it was guaranteed to be some or another kind of magical dynamic shit
[11:49:39] <nshepperd2> the control flow is 'uh, i dunno'
[11:50:08] <quanticle> Right, it's Harry Potter magic
[11:50:35] <quanticle> I just write some shit and because I pronounced wingardium levi-oh-sa correctly now I have a website
[11:51:04] <quanticle> But god forbid someone after me come along and try to decipher why I have to write levi-oh-sa instead of leviosa
[11:51:25] <quanticle> They'll change it, thinking they're just changing the name of a method that's called in one place and boom everything breaks
[11:52:01] <adiabatic> 'lol u shd have ritten moar tests'
[11:52:47] <quanticle> 'tEsTS aRe dOcUMenTaTiOn'
[11:53:22] <feep[work]> you swished when you should have flicked
[11:53:30] <nshepperd2> except the tests are even more mysterious gobbledygook written in pseudo-english
[11:53:32] <feep[work]> that was your first mistake
[11:53:57] <quanticle> I mean, what happens with Rails codebases as they age is that, over time, people become terrified of messing with the data model, so everything just bitrots because refactoring is terrifying
[11:54:06] * feep[work] guiltily hides his gobbledygook test framework written in pseudo-english behind his back
[11:54:10] <PapuaHardyNet> oh I agree. dynamically typed languages always give me anxiety over what exactly is inside variables
[11:54:21] <quanticle> Yeah, Python isn't... as bad
[11:54:27] <quanticle> But it's still *pretty bad*
[11:54:42] <quanticle> And I say this as a professional Python programmer with over a decade's worth of experience
[11:54:48] <feep[work]> quanticle sometimes you just want to hide a value in a class and pull it back out later like a rabbit
[11:55:01] <feep[work]> is that so wrong
[11:55:14] <feep[work]> just sort of .. shuffle it in there
[11:55:25] <feep[work]> it's a surprise! a data structure surprise!
[11:56:15] <quanticle> I will say this about Python, Ruby, Javascript and other dynamically typed languages: unit testing is hilarious and fun. Dependency injection? Nah, don't need it. I'll just @patch @patch @patch until the code runs!
[11:56:49] <feep[work]> the worst code in our entire company is a ~200 line python file
[11:57:02] <feep[work]> well, arguably
[11:57:16] <quanticle> Yeah, no Python file should ever be allowed to grow that long.
[11:57:23] <feep[work]> I mean, it's not the length
[11:57:30] <nshepperd2> python can be alright if you sprinkle everything with 'assert type(x) is Foo', but who's gonna make you do that? Moloch sure won't. and in the meantime all the 'duck typing' folks are getting out the pitchforks
[11:57:30] <adiabatic> is that entire file holding up the entire company
[11:57:31] <feep[work]> it's the ~state mutations everywhere~
[11:57:39] <feep[work]> adiabatic: I wish, then we could fix it
[11:57:51] <quanticle> nshepperd: Eh, Python has type annotations now
[11:58:02] <adiabatic> I was gonna say, doesn't it have type annotations
[11:58:46] <quanticle> With Python 3.10, it even gets nice union type syntax. You can write def print_greeting(greeting: str | None)
[11:59:30] <adiabatic> that sounds like table stakes
[11:59:45] <quanticle> Granted, it's still up to you to actually... *do* something with those annotations.
[11:59:54] <quanticle> Nothing's forcing you to run typing if you don't want to
[12:00:07] <adiabatic> are there linters that will bitch at you, or will the python interpreter?
[12:00:18] <quanticle> The Python interpreter will do nothing
[12:00:29] <quanticle> You can configure linters to run type checking for you
[12:00:31] * adiabatic hisses

[12:02:44] <quanticle> Yeah, Typescript is great, but I feel like "100% backwards compatibility with Javascript" ended up hurting it more than it helped. I suppose it helped adoption, by making Typescript not seem as scary as Elm or PureScript. But, I haven't seen too many projects adopt Typescript incrementally, as the Typescript docs promise you can. Usually it's a ground up, "Okay we're going to do version 2 in
[12:02:46] <quanticle> Typescript," sort of deal.

[19:49:56] <feep> it's not even on the german standard keymap
[19:50:32] <feep> PapuaHardyNet: anyway, in the reworked grammar √ü indicates a long vowel, so it now actually has pronounciation impact

[19:53:04] <feep> PapuaHardyNet: okay, in "rat race", the first "a" is short, the second "a" is long
[19:53:06] <kuudes> it is a consonant that is a long vowel?
[19:53:11] <feep> kuudes: it's just another spelling of s

[19:53:33] <kuudes> yes but "in the reworked grammar √ü indicates a long vowel"
[19:53:40] <feep> the preceding vowel is always long
[19:53:45] <kuudes> oh
[19:53:46] <dutchie> kuudes: it indicates that the preceding vowel is long

[19:54:31] <feep> though karl weierstra√ü would have a long a
[19:54:37] <kuudes> so strass is now straass
[19:54:38] <dutchie> iirc with √ü german always has "followed by single consonant means long vowel, double means short"

[19:54:47] <kuudes> aaa
[19:54:47] <feep> as he always was
[19:54:57] <feep> but the english spelling of weierstrass is no longer equivalent.
[19:55:38] <kuudes> argh. covid is now on increase over here because stupid people went to watch football to russia
[19:55:57] <dutchie> english has the same rule but less consistently
[19:56:01] <gwern> dbohdan: no idea. my only thought now is maybe run the regexes on the plain text of the entire document first, filter out ones with no matches anywhere, and then do the actual AST traverse with just the few that match

[22:23:45] <rmmh> the standard regex library has good linear time guarantees, it's just not *quite* as fast. if you want a faster library, it's not hard to switch
[22:24:13] <adiabatic> yeah, if you include a C project in your Go thing you lose a bit of portability and handiness
[22:24:27] <rmmh> there's also some FFI overhead
[22:25:36] <rmmh> dbohdan: to be clear: massive sets of regexes is exactly the sort of weird optimization edge case that you care about when you end up doing that
[22:26:14] <rmmh> fortunately most Go programs aren't bottlenecked by regex speed, so being 3x slower than PCRE for some easy regexes because it has a JIT and Go doesn't doesn't matter
