[01:43:50] <lagash> There any workaround to TLS completely not working? That bug was remarkably unintuitive to find..

[02:42:16] <wasamasa> lagash: using a recent emacs version linked against gnutls
[02:54:48] <lagash> wasamasa: 28.0.60, I'm not sure about GnuTLS though..
[02:55:03] <lagash> It worked fine before, until I updated a few days ago..
[02:55:59] <wasamasa> hm
[02:56:08] <wasamasa> it's not like there have been recent updates
[02:56:27] <wasamasa> last commit was in July
[02:56:44] <lagash> (gnutls-available-p) returns non-nil
[02:56:59] <wasamasa> fix that then :P
[02:57:07] <lagash> perhaps something to do with byte-compilation? or some other library?
[02:57:12] <wasamasa> lol
[02:57:19] <wasamasa> it means your emacs is not linked against gnutls
[02:57:23] <lagash> uh, non-nil, as in, GnuTLS is linked..
[02:57:36] <wasamasa> oh
[02:58:24] <wasamasa> well, then there's no reason for it to not work
[02:58:33] <wasamasa> who knows, maybe your network is broken
[02:58:34] <lagash> My biggest complaint was there was absolutely no indication of what was wrong.. I set irc-debug-log to t and there was no logs whatsoever
[02:58:42] <wasamasa> yes, that's a network problem usually
[02:58:47] <wasamasa> there's nothing circe can do to signal that
[02:58:48] *** Joins: GNUHacker (~foobar@fsf/member/GNUHacker)
[02:58:58] <wasamasa> the debug log is only of use once initial connection succeeds
[02:59:01] <lagash> But what if ERC works with TLS?!
[02:59:09] <wasamasa> ERC does things differently
[02:59:35] <lagash> Hmm. So, what network problem would Circe fail on that ERC doesn't?
[02:59:50] <wasamasa> something like ERC actually not using TLS
[03:00:19] <wasamasa> or with different options
[03:00:53] <lagash> "But it says erc-tls, so that means it uses TLS right?!" (:
[03:01:37] <wasamasa> yeah, circe uses make-network-stream, erc uses open-network-stream
[03:01:50] <lagash> And I assume you can't just swap them?
[03:02:05] <wasamasa> make-network-process even\
[03:02:36] <wasamasa> nope
[03:02:54] <wasamasa> open-network-stream is a funny wrapper around make-network-process
[03:04:28] <lagash> openssl s_client works perfectly fine too..

[03:05:46] <GNUHacker> im in erc with tls
[03:05:59] <wasamasa> this isn't used at all because in-process gnutls works a lot faster
[03:06:35] <wasamasa> and doesn't rely on people having the correct version of s_client installed
[03:06:44] <wasamasa> or gnutls-cli
[03:08:41] <lagash> OK..? So, where do I go sniffing for the bug?
[03:09:26] <wasamasa> look into the "updated a few days ago.." part
[03:11:33] <lagash> Well it's not like I can just revert :/
[03:12:00] <wasamasa> look at your update logs, the dates of the changed files, ...
[03:12:26] <wasamasa> once you've figured out what exactly changed, you can pinpoint what caused the problem, that I can then look at
[03:14:08] <lagash> let's go with "almost everything"
[03:15:04] <wasamasa> because I definitely will not go and do random changes for an issue affecting very few people if you can't invest that much effort to make sure I'm not wasting my time
[03:16:07] <lagash> I'll dig further then - irc-debug-log kinda threw me off
