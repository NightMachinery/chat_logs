[01:02:12] <GNUHacker> leonarth: yes, maybe

[02:03:09] <GNUHacker> nice

[19:41:07] <Andrew> I make it hard for myself by wrapping apt in a script that uninstalls coreutils if I install something nonfree
[19:41:08] <leonarth> Ubuntu > Trisquel
[19:41:08] <leonarth> Debian > PureOS
[19:41:17] <gnoo> and as a side effect, you can't have kernel modules in it as well
[19:41:17] <labrador> Can you read this isf?
[19:41:25] * Andrew disagrees with leonarth though
[19:41:31] <gnoo> so to install non-free software, you'll have to compile your own linux
[19:41:48] <gnoo> non-free kernel module*
[19:41:54] <Andrew> Oh, yeah
[19:42:00] <Andrew> It'd be scary to not have modules at all
[19:42:02] <GNUHacker> people that promote GNU distros with optional non-free software when we have fully free GNU distros without non-free software https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html
[19:42:29] <leonarth> Andrew well at least you're sure there's no LKM rootkit on your system :D
[19:42:37] <Andrew> leonarth: LKM? What?
[19:42:38] <gnoo> Andrew: there are modules. just that they have to be compiled at the same time as compiling your kernel
[19:42:50] <Andrew> gnoo: ofc
[19:42:59] <leonarth> Andrew linux kernel module
[19:43:03] <Andrew> Isn't that how modules are compiled anyway?
[19:43:11] <Andrew> Or maybe that's not the case on other distros.
[19:43:11] <leonarth> .ko files
[19:43:33] <Andrew> GNUHacker: Again, sometimes it's a technical choice.  As long as we know how to keep the ethical ones under control, using a distro that doesn't enforces free software is okay.
[19:43:37] <gnoo> Andrew: on other distros, you can load them later, on linux-libre, you can't
[19:43:39] <leonarth> gnoo means you cannot insmod on free distros?
[19:43:45] <Andrew> gnoo: Oh, didn't know that
[19:43:54] <Andrew> I always thought that kernel modules have to compiled when compiling the kernel
[19:44:03] <Andrew> (Probably because I only compiled Linux-libre before lol)
[19:44:05] <leonarth> no, you can insert them later
[19:44:09] <Andrew> GNUHacker: People have different tastes to package managers
[19:44:21] <Andrew> leonarth: It's the Linux-libre kernel that disallows that
[19:44:33] <leonarth> which makes it rootkit-proof
[19:44:42] <kompowiec> "I will agree to any package manager as long as it's an X"
[19:44:46] <GNUHacker> the freedom is most important to me
[19:44:48] <leonarth> nobody can install a kernel module and hook syscalls
[19:45:41] <Andrew> kompowiec: ?
[19:45:53] <Andrew> GNUHacker: It's also the most important to me.  As long I can get it and keep it, I don't care that much (not "at all") that free software isn't enforced.
[19:46:15] <Andrew> Again Gentoo has ways to enforce free software in the package manager, and it's explicitly mentioned in the installation guide.
[19:46:41] <kompowiec> Andrew, well, they managed to count around 26 different package managers for Linux. Developer's nightmare.

[20:07:06] <gnoo> so you can roll-back to any previous version
[20:07:23] <gnoo> or have profiles that have installed different things and switch between them
[20:07:34] <gnoo> "seamlessly" 
[20:07:39] <Andrew> Yes, Guix's package manager (Guix) is insane
[20:07:44] <Andrew> Not exactly seamless...
[20:07:45] <leonarth> wow
[20:07:45] <gnoo> you can even do that on a running system
[20:07:52] <gnoo> brb
[20:07:57] <Andrew> It can't do that to running procs :)
[20:08:08] <leonarth> guix will basically kill all package managers
[20:08:09] <Andrew> However I find the Guix directory structure to be quite hard to grasp
[20:08:15] <leonarth> why do you need apt or yum when you have guix

[20:09:52] <ggoes> i hope it trickles down to trisquel

[20:11:15] <Andrew> leonarth: I think pureos is more of a desktop system
[20:11:21] <Andrew> While trisquel is more general-purpose.
[20:11:39] <leonarth> so if I use pureos is only for my pc
[20:11:42] <isf> pureos based in debian
[20:11:50] <leonarth> but if I use trisquel I can use for home use and server
[20:11:53] <isf> trisquel based on ubuntu
[20:12:20] <Andrew> leonarth: Warning: If you hear people talking about Nonguix and saying you should add the Nonguix repo, think again three times.  Nonguix is a mostly nonfree repository, and since you're using Guix in Debian, you'd be installing firmware with APT anyway, so don't add the Nonguix repo.

[20:14:01] <leonarth> thank you Andrew 
[20:14:38] <leonarth> trisquel spanish distro
[20:14:40] <Andrew> You're welcome :)
[20:14:52] <Andrew> It also has good English versions lol
[20:15:20] <Andrew> By the way, I'd recommend using the GNU IceCat Web browser, the latest version is in (and probably only in) the Guix repository and the Savannah.
[20:16:04] <leonarth> icecat is fork of firefox?
[20:16:21] <Andrew> leonarth: Yeah, but it doesn't recommend nonfree stuff, etc.
[20:16:40] <Andrew> It also comes with GNU LibreJS, connection blockers, and all the good stuff.
[20:18:20] <ggoes> and a better logo
[20:18:42] <gnoo> it also removes mozilla's telemetry iirc
[20:18:58] <Andrew> Yup
[20:19:03] <Andrew> And no Pocket stuff
[20:19:16] <Andrew> (Furryfox sync is still there, I disable it in about:config)
[20:19:25] <GNUHacker> furry lol
[20:20:54] <kompowiec> someone had balls
[20:21:31] <labrador> firefox is like the best browser
[20:21:41] <Andrew> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[20:21:56] <Andrew> labrador: Why the heck would firefox be the best browser?
[20:22:42] <gnoo> web browsers are all bad. just that firefox is slightly less bad than the alternative 
[20:22:54] <Andrew> IceCat is pretty good
[20:22:59] <Andrew> Lynx is best :)
[20:23:02] <labrador> cause its an useragennt instead of a website agent
[20:23:08] <labrador> and is mpl
[20:23:14] <Andrew> Well, of course EWW is best, but that's on another level.
[20:23:17] <ggoes> i like eww.el and netsurf the most
[20:23:21] <ggoes> and dillo
[20:23:27] <Andrew> Dillo! Yay
[20:23:37] <Andrew> I don't like netsurf that much, but DILLO!!!
[20:23:57] <Andrew> (And, dillo explicitly talks about free software, which is cool!)
[20:24:10] <Andrew> Fun fact: I turn off all the CSS in dillo
[20:24:44] <gnoo> i turn off all the css in eww ;)
[20:25:07] <Andrew> I don't think CSS makes a single difference in eww
[20:25:16] <labrador> ggoes, any problem with ff?
[20:25:20] <Andrew> EWW seems pretty slow for me though.
[20:25:23] <labrador> or just a choice
[20:25:51] <Andrew> labrador: 1. Telemetry by default  2. Recommends nonfree codecs  3. Contains furryfox sync and pocket  4. Has Google as the default search engine
[20:25:56] <ggoes> firefox proper's recommending nonfree software is a problem
[20:26:05] <ggoes> between icecat and the others, it's mostly just a preference thing
[20:26:18] * Andrew doesn't even know what LibreWolf actually is
[20:26:25] <gnoo> Andrew: try visiting the POSIX page in eww and you'll think differently 
[20:26:25] <labrador> what about librewolf ggoes ?
[20:26:30] <ggoes> never heard of it
[20:26:33] <labrador> oh
[20:26:34] <labrador> ll
[20:26:37] <labrador> lol
[20:27:08] <Andrew> By the way, how do I make eww a normal buffer?
[20:27:18] <Andrew> It always wants to be on the bottom half of my screen
[20:28:24] <Andrew> It looks like a minibuffer, but it isn't.
[20:29:27] <gnoo> Andrew: doesn't happen with emacs -Q
[20:29:30] <ggoes> that's odd; not sure personally. i've never run into that
[20:29:34] <gnoo> (or my emacs config)
[20:29:38] <labrador> its basically like fennec on f-droid ggoes,it makes it more private(arkenfox,letterboxes,telmetry off),removes sync and pocket,and has many search engines.
[20:29:40] <Andrew> gnoo: Hmm, my configs are broken I guess
[20:29:47] <labrador> a set of patches on ff
[20:29:52] <labrador> basicallu
[20:30:18] <ggoes> my favorite part about eww is that you can set fill/wrap columns. i'm sure you can do that in the other text browsers, but i never bothered to learn how to do it
[20:30:45] <ggoes> via `shr-width' variable
[20:31:00] <gnoo> i remember eww being fast but damn, it's a lot slower now a days
[20:31:10] <gnoo> even opening a pastebin takes a lot of time
[20:31:31] <ggoes> w3m was faster back when that was the main emacs browser. i'm mostly just glad there's a good one in vanilla emacs now
[20:32:04] <ggoes> gluing w3m to emacs that is, via w3m-el, not that w3m was actually in it
[20:32:31] <Andrew> I hate having all those things in vanilla emacs...
[20:32:39] <Andrew> ESPECIALLY TETRIS AND DOCTOR
[20:32:46] <ggoes> that's the best part
[20:32:58] <Andrew> Just a bunch of things that I do not need.
[20:33:30] <gnoo> just rm the lisp files if you don't want it
[20:33:45] <ggoes> it's not like doctor.el is ever loaded unless you invoke it
[20:33:50] <Andrew> gnoo: Of course, but the problem is why that comes with vanilla emacs
[20:33:51] <ggoes> so why worry about it?
[20:34:05] <corwin> Controllability, "Just Works", "Only what I need".  Pick no more than two
[20:34:50] <gnoo> its sad how much other suff can't be easily changed as emacs can
[20:35:05] <gnoo> to change guix i have to basically fork it and maintain my own version
[20:35:22] <Andrew> ggoes: Practically: It's taking up a few kilobytes of my disk space; Technical-philosophically: There shouldn't be anything more that comes with a program/operating system other than the base program/operating system.  Any program/plugin/package/etc that is not strictly necessary to the functioning of the program/operating system is bloat and must be avoided.
[20:36:32] <gnoo> Andrew: is there tetris in emacs-minimal (or whatever that one is called) ?

[20:39:10] <Andrew> I'm still quite new to emacs, so I'm still running the full distro on this computer, but on all other ones I strip everything else by deleting and modifying elisp files.
[20:39:21] <Andrew> I haven't heard of emacs-minimal before though.
[20:39:56] <gnoo> it's a build time flag like native-comp
[20:41:04] <Andrew> :\
[20:41:10] <Andrew> Nice
[20:41:25] <corwin> Andrew, afaiu Emacs is the batteries included editor GNU provides.  It's intended to have most of what people need to get started programming, writing, etc text related work.  Contrast with, like, Nano.  Less learning curve, minimal features.  Vim is in the middle, not as extensible, not as steep a learning curve but still pluggable and still a fair bit of learning curve.
[20:41:54] <Andrew> Yup
[20:42:25] <leonarth> will I be able to install trisquel and have it run properly on ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 8?
[20:42:33] <gnoo> Andrew: there's zile which is minimal emacs
[20:42:38] <corwin> From that perspective, I'm not sure it's "fair" to users with a different use-case from your own to say, e.g. Emacs shouldn't come with a Games menu.
[20:42:49] <gnoo> i used it three times, while installing guix
[20:42:51] <Andrew> leonarth: When is that from?
[20:43:03] <Andrew> gnoo: I remember it, yeah
[20:43:08] <leonarth> it's the latest

[20:43:16] <ggoes> i like the "everything and the kitchen sink" approach, personally
[20:43:22] <Andrew> leonarth: Probably not
[20:43:23] <leonarth> I can buy older if need be from used market, e.g. gen7
[20:43:26] <ggoes> well, in this particular case
[20:43:33] <gnoo> Andrew: well that's the barebones with nothing extra emacs you wanted
[20:43:33] <Andrew> Well, since there is this compilation flag, I'm happy :)
[20:44:31] <Andrew> Yeah
[20:44:59] <labrador> ggoes, so you like matrix over xmpp too?

[20:45:38] <gnoo> like emacs. but not for systemd or anything related to it
[20:45:53] <ggoes> gnoo: i agree, that's why i clarified with "in this particular case"
[20:45:56] <Andrew> Full emacs has issues, well quite minor.
[20:45:58] <Andrew> Systemd, lol
[20:46:31] <ggoes> gnu shepherd is cool
[20:46:31] <gnoo> do people even use the period on text messages? lol
[20:46:35] <corwin> I like the kitchen-sink approach too; I've learned how to do things just reading the elisp that automates them.
[20:46:42] <ggoes> yeah same
[20:46:53] <Andrew> gnoo: I do, for sentences longer than three words.
[20:47:02] <Andrew> Well that became a rececent habit :)
[20:47:15] <Andrew> See, if I'm ending it with a text emoji, no period though.
[20:47:30] <corwin> I consider a key (but unusual) feature of Emacs is being a brain trust of how decades of hackers have accomplished (sometimes very obscure) tasks.
[20:48:10] <Andrew> Not that valuable for an every-day user though.
[20:48:49] *** Joins: zoe (~zoe@fsf/member/zoe)
[20:49:17] <ggoes> i disagree; part of emacs's "thing" is making every-day users into emacs hackers, so i like that everything's there and immediately accessible to inspection
[20:49:29] <Andrew> Arguable
[20:49:35] <gnoo> i find things included in emacs easier to use and better in most cases than third party repos. not to mention the documentation of things in emacs is really good
[20:49:59] <gnoo> except for org-mode, compared to normal emacs, org mode has slightly worse documentation but it makes up for that in other ways
[20:50:22] <Andrew> Oh I like org-mode
[20:50:29] <corwin> same, but it's a constant battle to keep things that way, as trying to follow the emacs-devel mailing list demonstrates.
[20:50:41] <Andrew> The documentation is bad, but the community "docs" are good.
[20:51:01] <corwin> Fair point.  Speaking as a WORG repo... we're working on that.

[20:53:51] <corwin> There's a ton of pressure on the emacs devs to "make it work like VSCode" and otherwise chase the tail of (IMO) inferior tools that express less understanding of both the machines and the development toolchains we're using.

[20:59:10] <Andrew> You could implement that by creating a git commit for each action and making "undo" git reset.
[20:59:18] <Andrew> Sounds silly, just a metaphor.
[20:59:26] <gnoo> Andrew: so, it's presistent across sessions?
[20:59:40] <Andrew> gnoo: No, this is an example of the undo tree.
[21:00:04] <Andrew> It's basically a Git tree, without the Git stuff.  You want it persistant?  Sure
[21:00:14] <corwin> I played with undo-tree a little but I didn't find it offered anything I didn't get from the linked list approach Emacs has by default (so far).
[21:00:26] <Andrew> No branches or other nonsense for simple text editing.  Just detached HEADS and commits (actions).
[21:00:53] <Andrew> corwin: It's different if you're a non-native speaker and edit the text all the time, though.
[21:01:08] <gnoo> if you do something in a detached HEAD, it gets added to the front of the list as a new "commit" ?
[21:01:20] <m4t3> It should not be like VSCode but better; we all agree that Emacs is powerful, is it beautiful? Emacs is like a Queen in rugs.
[21:01:44] <gnoo> beauty is subjective. i find emacs beautiful 
[21:01:52] <Andrew> No, that was my fault.  It's just a tree, you can consider everything to be a detached head (multiple detached HEADs, yay!).
[21:02:17] <gnoo> even the default theme isn't bad. i personally use tsdh-dark

[21:13:41] <kompowiec> since even slackware has buckled and is already using pulseuadio, it means too many applications require it.
[21:13:47] <Andrew> gnoo: It's hard to get alsa working on it's own for many systems.  If you can do so, that's nice!
[21:14:02] <gnoo> i never did anything special tho
[21:14:06] <isf> someone know where download music without DRM? im looking for buckethead album (web pages)
[21:14:07] <gnoo> it just werks
