[02:51:00] <Activ8> Lol
[02:52:06] <Activ8> @parker all we know is it’s failing on that application so keep running the build and find the app deployment fail logs
[02:52:21] <Hunterkll> ^ nah, deploy it to a working machine with the SCCM agent 
[02:52:25] <Hunterkll> see if it works that way first
[02:52:43] <Hunterkll> if it can't silent install on a running OS - which is your easiest debug scenario - then you fix it there first
[02:53:03] <Activ8> well there’s that, I’ve done it that way and it fails on a working machine but passes on a sccm deployment lol
[02:53:19] <Hunterkll> Activ8: i meant deploy it from SCCM to an already installed machine OS

[02:59:02] <Hunterkll> you won't be able to do that for a while
[02:59:07] <Hunterkll> depending on how your cycles are configured, etc
[02:59:14] <Hunterkll> hence saying troubleshoot app deployments on working systems first
[02:59:44] <Hunterkll> task sequence is essentially running outside of the agent

[03:02:28] <xe0n> it needs to check in to grab your environment config
[03:02:30] <xe0n> and sort itself out
[03:02:35] <Hunterkll> right
[03:02:43] <Hunterkll> @Parker that's the state it's in.... during the task sequence

[03:03:02] <sd> 02<P​arker> yep
[03:03:15] <Hunterkll> but ... deployment needs to work inside the agent... to work in task sequence

[03:04:46] <Hunterkll> manually install/join a fresh machine, with no GPO (maybe an OU exempt from GPO), then install SCCM agent... 
[03:04:46] <sd> 02<P​arker> sorry I am lost so Configuration Client communicates with Distribution Point during Task Sequence
[03:04:58] <Hunterkll> kind of?
[03:05:34] <Hunterkll> depends on stage, etc.... and what's going on.... and what component is using which
[03:06:41] <Hunterkll> @Parker think of the task sequence engine as similar to, but independant of the SCCM agent itself
[03:07:00] <Activ8> I’ve just had a quick look it was actually 2008 when we deployed the sccm servers, wow that was a long time ago
[03:07:06] <Hunterkll> I mean, think about it this way 
[03:07:19] <Hunterkll> The task sequence engine deploys the SCCM agent using the SCCM package for the agent
[03:07:35] <Activ8> I found the project planning documentation but not the configuration documentation 
[03:07:38] *** Quits: Seirdy (~Seirdy@sourcehut/user/seirdy) (Quit: exiting 3.2)
[03:07:48] <Hunterkll> It deploys the SCCM package *without* using the SCCM agent
[03:07:54] <xe0n> the task sequence is ran outside of the agent
[03:07:58] <Hunterkll> but it does it in a near identical way to the SCCM agent on an installed machine
[03:07:58] <xe0n> the task sequenece installs the agent on the machine
[03:08:05] <xe0n> the machine will eventually check into a management point

[03:10:41] <Hunterkll> now - in the install environment of an OSD TS, yes, things can be a bit different sometimes, but it's usually not big enough to matter
[03:11:04] <xe0n> https://youtu.be/u7KGKcAji78
[03:11:08] <xe0n> its that day...
[03:11:30] <sd> 02<P​arker> client is using SCCM for their float, our site is new remote site
[03:11:47] <Hunterkll> float? XD
[03:11:53] <sd> 02<P​arker> sorry 😛
[03:12:00] <Hunterkll> I think you mean fleet :D
[03:12:09] <sd> 02<P​arker> oh yeez 😛
[03:12:12] <sd> 02<P​arker> it is late
[03:12:13] <Hunterkll> oh
[03:12:14] <Hunterkll> well
[03:12:21] <sd> 02<P​arker> yeah besically
[03:12:22] <Hunterkll> *check subnet boundaries* 
[03:12:27] <Hunterkll> that is important too
[03:12:40] <sd> 02<P​arker> they are using same TS on their premises and in our remote site
[03:12:53] <Activ8> I’m watching some videos it’s come along way since 2008
[03:12:54] <Hunterkll> yea if there's no boundary assigned to dp/mp
[03:12:55] <sd> 02<P​arker> in their premises all works
[03:13:00] <Hunterkll> okay
[03:13:03] <Hunterkll> so it's a known working TS
[03:13:04] <Hunterkll> but new site
[03:13:08] <Hunterkll> boundaries would be my first thought
[03:13:09] <sd> 02<P​arker> yep
[03:13:15] <sd> 02<P​arker> checked
[03:13:21] <sd> 02<P​arker> looks good
[03:13:24] <Hunterkll> IP range or site-services?
[03:13:29] <Hunterkll> any conflicts, nat, firewall?
[03:13:32] <sd> 02<P​arker> IP range
[03:13:38] <sd> 02<P​arker> nope
[03:14:22] <Hunterkll> DP content distribution?
[03:14:39] <sd> 02<P​arker> on local DP server
[03:14:51] <sd> 02<P​arker> I mean on our site
[03:15:18] <Hunterkll> now when you say client......
[03:15:28] <Hunterkll> you really mean acquiring company, right?
[03:15:29] <Hunterkll> :)
[03:16:15] <sd> 02<P​arker> we are MSP, we are offering deployment services for the client
[03:16:29] <sd> 02<P​arker> normally we are using MDT for other customers
[03:16:41] <sd> 02<P​arker> but this one got SCCM requirements
[03:16:46] <Hunterkll> so this is an isolated network, site-site VPN'd 
[03:16:51] <sd> 02<P​arker> yep
[03:16:55] <Hunterkll> with DHCP handing out the correct DNS suffix for their AD domain
[03:17:05] <sd> 02<P​arker> yep
[03:17:11] <Hunterkll> okay, we did something like that with $big_distributor once to bulk image a 20k fleet refresh
[03:17:13] <Hunterkll> it just worked xD
[03:17:24] <sd> 02<P​arker> heh
[03:17:27] <sd> 02<P​arker> that helped 😛
[03:18:08] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/407265509931745281/887469794826289223/unknown.png
[03:18:16] <Hunterkll> but you got a boundary defined - just like that
[03:18:24] <Hunterkll> with the network segment they extended to your network
[03:18:31] <Hunterkll> and there's no overlap with any of their network?
[03:18:36] <Hunterkll> and that new boundary segment IS properly assigned?
[03:18:42] <sd> 02<P​arker> yes for our local private IP
[03:18:55] <Hunterkll> when you say private IP
[03:19:07] <sd> 02<P​arker> one sec
[03:19:13] <Hunterkll> do you mean <our /24 subnet of their corporate network> or <our single IP going into their network>
[03:20:40] <xe0n> are you building the environment in their network, or are you trying to extend your msp's environment to manage theirs?
[03:20:50] <Hunterkll> xe0n: other way around
[03:20:55] <Hunterkll> client is extending network *to them* 
[03:20:57] <Hunterkll> to do imaging
[03:20:58] <sd> 02<P​arker> MSP Local Private IP (Designated for the Client only) => ASA => WAN => Site to Site VPN <= WAN <= Firewall <= Remote Client Private IP (With main AD, DC,DNS, SCCM)
[03:20:58] <xe0n> wtf
[03:21:13] <Hunterkll> xe0n: we did that with $distributor before to do a fleet reimage....
[03:21:19] <Hunterkll> @Parker okay, yea
[03:21:22] <Hunterkll> you're NAT'ing 
[03:21:25] <Hunterkll> that's not going to help 
[03:21:49] <Hunterkll> at least, from that description 
[03:22:17] <Hunterkll> xe0n: we extended our network with a restricted subnet (mind you, an actuall, full, routed subnet with D P/MP box) for them to image machines before shipping to users
[03:22:17] <Hunterkll> lol
[03:22:23] <Hunterkll> they even put the asset tags on for us
[03:22:24] <Hunterkll> <3
[03:22:32] <sd> 02<P​arker> but site to site vpn is configured to comunicate between subnets oveer the tunnel
[03:22:37] <Hunterkll> sure
[03:22:43] <Hunterkll> what i'm saying is
[03:22:49] <Hunterkll> imagine my corporate network is 10.0.0.0/8 
[03:22:50] <sd> 02<P​arker> so it should not go over NAT
[03:22:58] <Hunterkll> you should have 10.0.69.0/24 
[03:23:00] <Hunterkll> for imaging
[03:23:03] <Hunterkll> and it should be fully routed
[03:23:18] <sd> 02<P​arker> yep
[03:23:23] <Hunterkll> so when you're imaging a machine, it's 'fully inside' the corporate network
[03:23:39] <sd> 02<P​arker> yep
[03:23:48] <Hunterkll> and this is an entirely isolated basically "wire drop" network
[03:23:53] <Hunterkll> aka if i just ran a fiber off my router to your office
[03:24:23] <frostybrew> What's the issue fully?
[03:24:25] <Hunterkll> the only way your MSP network should be able to get to it..... is if you go your MSP connection -> their network -> back to the isolated network 
[03:24:29] <frostybrew> Sorry just got back
[03:24:33] <Hunterkll> frostybrew: task sequences being fucky and hanging for hours
[03:24:35] <Hunterkll> lol
[03:24:47] <frostybrew> So for starters, the connectivity is there
[03:24:55] <Hunterkll> .... we haven't really established that
[03:25:06] <frostybrew> Isn't that the only way a task can begin in the first place?
[03:25:08] <Hunterkll> @Parker so in *their* SCCM ...... you have a slice of *their* network and an IP range boundary configured 
[03:25:15] *** Quits: AnonymooseReddtr (~Anonymoos@user/anonymoosereddtr) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[03:25:24] <Hunterkll> frostybrew: ..... you'd be surprised what you can abuse and can work but also won't work in weird situations
[03:25:47] <frostybrew> Yeah I don't deal with SCCM very often
[03:25:52] <frostybrew> I'm just a network guy
[03:26:31] <Hunterkll> @Parker basically, what i'm saying is, obviously barring firewall rules they may want in place, you sitting on that lan segment should be identical to sitting at the desk in their office
[03:26:42] <Hunterkll> or being on wifi vs @ desk 
[03:27:52] <Hunterkll> to *their* network you should just be another vlan on the router
[03:27:57] <sd> 02<P​arker> Yes, I understand, but that's why we have VPN site to site, instead isn;t right ?
[03:28:05] <Hunterkll> yes, but 
[03:28:10] <Hunterkll> hm
[03:28:12] <Hunterkll> easy way to test
[03:28:13] *** Quits: yuken (~yuken@user/yuken) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[03:28:20] <Hunterkll> traceroute to their SCCM server from your deployment vlan 
[03:28:23] <Hunterkll> see what the route/path is
[03:28:28] <xe0n> fyi - https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-fixes-remaining-windows-printnightmare-vulnerabilities/
[03:29:05] <Hunterkll> @Parker and they parked an MP/DP on your LAN, right?
[03:29:17] <gibby> xe0n: I-dont_believe_you.gif
[03:29:33] * xe0n chucks gibby a beer

[03:29:51] <xe0n> cheers!
[03:30:11] <gibby> cheers!
[03:30:42] <sd> 02<P​arker> only DP on my LAN I believe
[03:31:09] <Hunterkll> well that should be fine enough
[03:31:19] <Hunterkll> lol AMERICA https://www.reddit.com/r/Whatcouldgowrong/comments/po38mu/trying_to_randomly_break_into_someone_house/
[03:31:39] <xe0n> MP would be handy as well
[03:31:49] <xe0n> that way it can report to a local box and then send back to primary
[03:31:54] <Hunterkll> yea i don't think we even did MP for when we did that massive refresh 
[03:31:55] <xe0n> something something.....speed? shrug
[03:31:59] <Hunterkll> either way 
[03:32:31] <Hunterkll> @Parker at this point, turn off app deployment TS stage and see if it works
[03:32:32] <Hunterkll> LOL
[03:32:43] <Hunterkll> it seems to mostly work
[03:32:52] <xe0n> yeah i'd confirm a basic ts jsut to get a machine running is working first
[03:32:55] <Hunterkll> i have some serious questions re: network config, DP deployment, VLAN setup, tunnel, etc 
[03:32:57] <xe0n> then add your steps i.e. install apps etc
[03:33:09] <xe0n> CEREAL QUESTIONS
[03:33:26] <Hunterkll> i'm also wondering why a customer big enough to do such a thing is doing it 
[03:33:33] <sd> 02<P​arker> Not tested by me, other guy in my team and he said it worked without apps install, but would need to check tomorrow to confirm
[03:33:35] <gibby> mmmm cereal 
[03:33:36] <Hunterkll> we did it because we didn't want to waste labor on imaging 20k new machines
[03:34:05] <Hunterkll> but we also basically just dropped fiber and firewalled off all the shit SCCM and AD didn't need and put the site server in a locked cage with a shitload of shit on it 
[03:34:20] <xe0n> lol so yesterday i got dragged into a meeting about a particular process that was being fleshed out, and the team who are putting it together said yeah they've tested it in a number of scenarios...sweet
[03:34:23] <sd> 02<P​arker> why customer big enough is doing what ?
[03:34:32] <xe0n> well...i guess they didnt test the scenario that broke the process overnight for something
[03:34:33] <sd> 02<P​arker> outsourcing job to MSP?
[03:34:33] <xe0n> LOL
[03:34:35] <Hunterkll> @Parker to be using SCCM reguarly is outsourcing like this
[03:34:35] <Hunterkll> yes
[03:34:57] <Hunterkll> sounds like they're axing their internal IT or something
[03:34:58] <Hunterkll> :D
[03:35:16] <sd> 02<P​arker> hmm short staff? international company whre apart of the MSP sevices we can sort out shipment etc
[03:35:26] <sd> 02<P​arker> there are few resons to be honest
[03:35:29] <Hunterkll> ah maybe local on hands
[03:35:30] <Hunterkll> that's fair
[03:35:44] <Hunterkll> xe0n: ah so they didn't bother to test the scenario that would actually happen in production
[03:35:48] <Hunterkll> why would they test that?
[03:35:50] <xe0n> probably
[03:35:50] <xe0n> lol
[03:36:03] <Hunterkll> thats what prod-testing is for
[03:36:47] <Hunterkll> @Parker I've got a slew of ideas I can think of, but sadly not enough information to *easily* narrow it down
[03:36:57] <Hunterkll> but at least - failures are happening after first reboot
[03:37:01] <Hunterkll> so that's something we can go off of
[03:37:05] <xe0n> fyi - it's plex week
[03:37:09] <sd> 02<P​arker> yeah no worries, thanks for your help guys
[03:37:10] <xe0n> you can get 20% off lifetime price
[03:37:16] <xe0n> so might be of some interest to others?
[03:37:27] <xe0n> ive seen the price lower...something something black friday? i dunno...

[19:10:31] <BritneySpears14> why not make one dict to rule them all?
[19:10:35] <PublicWiFi> can python do #include files? lol
[19:10:47] <BritneySpears14> yeah, its called import

[19:11:32] <BritneySpears14> https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html

[19:12:24] <PublicWiFi> guess i ought to
[19:12:35] <BritneySpears14> what are these dictionaries? Why not just throw them into yaml files and load them in?
[19:13:27] <PublicWiFi> its basically a bunch of names of shit that vary by each of our clients
[19:13:34] <PublicWiFi> its billing, so these are billing codes

[19:15:39] <PublicWiFi> Look at me, I'm devops now
[19:15:48] <BritneySpears14> i dunno bout you, but I'd write some generic thing that creates a report, and gets configuration from a yaml file, then you could process each item individually, or write a wrapper script to do it all
[19:16:01] <PublicWiFi> yeah the main script is generic
[19:16:03] <estranger> I was with you until "yaml"
[19:16:12] <PublicWiFi> it just needs a proper "lookup" table for these billing coes
[19:16:13] <BritneySpears14> json?
[19:16:14] <PublicWiFi> codes*
[19:16:17] <PublicWiFi> json is my shit
[19:16:23] <BritneySpears14> yaml is the native storage format for python
[19:16:35] <JollyRgrs> yaml is ezpz
[19:16:38] <PublicWiFi> basically the codes are grouped, but the groups can change so I just need to lookup the code in a table and output a group
[19:16:42] <BritneySpears14> and its so much cleaner and easier read/write than json
[19:16:43] <gibby> ur ezpz
[19:16:48] <PublicWiFi> ur mom is ezpz
[19:16:56] <JollyRgrs> just use a nice program like vs code and yaml is cake

[19:17:04] <PublicWiFi> gotem
[19:17:17] <BritneySpears14> yaml is easy if you spend hours a day writing ansible and stupid yaml-ingesting scripts
[19:17:32] <JollyRgrs> yaml is easy even if not that
[19:17:52] <estranger> yeah yaml isn't terrible its just... harder to deal with when not in a nice editor 
[19:17:58] <estranger> dealt with it too much in my cassandra days
[19:18:09] <JollyRgrs> yeah, do not notepad.exe yaml and expect it to be a good day
[19:18:14] <BritneySpears14> it was confusing when I didn't use it regularly since there are a lot of things screwball coworkers can do to throw you off like using ~ or [ ] instead of -

[19:18:54] <PublicWiFi> vscode hotkeys bother me
[19:19:06] <PublicWiFi> like new document isn't Ctrl + N or some retarded shit like that
[19:19:20] <JollyRgrs> why wouldn't N(ew) be the right one?
[19:19:27] <JollyRgrs> are you used to Ctrl+T for new TAB?
[19:19:44] <PublicWiFi> i swear there was some hotkeysd in vscode that didn't make sense and pissed me off lol
[19:19:56] <PublicWiFi> pretty sure Ctrl + N isn't a new page in vscode but i might be wrong
[19:20:02] <JollyRgrs> i like the vscode hotkeys for stuff like indents and the diff type of cursors
[19:20:12] <BritneySpears14> I much prefer the simple vim hotkey of :tabnew. so intuitive!
[19:20:31] <PublicWiFi> fuck vi/vim
[19:20:32] <PublicWiFi> idgaf
[19:20:36] <JollyRgrs> most of my experience with vi is on freebsd OSes
[19:20:43] <PublicWiFi> im not editing a 5000 doc in bim
[19:20:45] <PublicWiFi> vim*
[19:20:46] <BritneySpears14> then you need to :w /path/to/file 
[19:20:47] <JollyRgrs> which is SOOOOOOO MUCH WORSE than on like centos
[19:20:48] <int0x1C8> can't you edit the hotkeys?
[19:20:58] <BritneySpears14> then :e /path/to/file so subsequent :w actually writes.

[23:02:04] <thegodsquirrel> Buuuuuttt itttt works

[23:03:15] <seednode> So I can cast from any of my VLANs to the Chromecasts on their isolated one
[23:03:41] <seednode> It's a container written by someone on the sysadmin discord that lets you cast supported media URLs to a Chromecast by specifying the Chromecast IP and URL in a request
[23:03:54] <sd> 09<H​aise> I use NVIDIA Shield for streaming content to my TV
