[21:50:30] <jan6> "The Metaverse Is Worse Than You Thought"
[21:51:07] <jan6> basically, facebook will own reality, and china will own the hardware it runs on, if all goes to themegalomaniacs' plans
[21:52:03] <jan6> and since you work, love, pray, live in the metaverse, it can just tweak your life till any unwanted opinions dissappear
[21:53:57] <jan6> and nobody can protect you, since politicians rely on that same billionaire tech, so they can't do anything without sabotaging themselves
