[00:26:58] <Guest66> Hello, everybody, can you please help me with one question about the "evil-collection-translate-key" command? How can I properly translate multiple keys commands ?
[00:28:44] <Guest66> I'm trying to use it to enable transparent cyrillic support... Basically I want to just fully map letters from one keyboard layout to corresponding english ones...
[00:28:56] <Guest66> I.e. I have a code like this
[00:28:58] <wasamasa> that's related to evil-collection, not evil

[00:29:08] <wasamasa> best you ask them
[00:29:57] <Guest66> Mmm.. I'm trying to use evil-collection-translate-key, which is from evil-collection?
[00:30:03] <wasamasa> yes
[00:30:30] <Guest66> That's why I hoped that maybe someone would know the internals of it..
[00:30:48] <wasamasa> that aside, your problem may or may not be worked around by using an emacs input method
[00:31:29] <wasamasa> that way evil sees the OS input method keys for commands and the emacs input method keys when typing
[00:32:07] <Guest66> Yes... that's what I've always wondered... I don't really get the input method thing... I mean I have the system layout, that I change using one global shortcut in all applications... but I need to use another one just for Emacs?
[00:32:20] <wasamasa> if you like the emacs one, yes
[00:32:38] <wasamasa> the reason why I wrote it may not solve your problems is that from the brief testing I did, it's not a perfect solution
[00:32:39] <Guest66> also If I use custom layout created in Ukelele I need to somehow recreate it in Emacs...
[00:33:24] <Guest66> yee... I think input method switching is very tedious to use
[00:33:43] <wasamasa> for example there's an old bug report about it not reading in the correct key when using a replace command
[00:33:58] <wasamasa> the idea of the approach is not needing to switch input methods at all
[00:34:00] <Guest66> That's why I just want to transparently rebind everything in non-insert mode
[00:34:22] <wasamasa> but it requires all commands to be aware of this
[00:35:55] <Guest66> well... AFAIU, the translate-key approach basically traverses all the bindings in a keymap, replaces correspondings keys in a bindings and rebinds them to the same command
[00:36:56] <Guest66> This does work for a one-key bindings, but  multi-key ones it's not consistent... it somewhat works, but not really j
[00:37:01] <Guest66> This does work for a one-key bindings, but  multi-key ones it's not consistent... it somewhat works, but not really )
[00:38:47] <Guest66> You've mention that's related to evil-collection more then for core evil directly... Maybe you know of some way to contact them ? There is no mention for a separate irc channel...
[00:40:41] <wasamasa> I guess you could try https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil-collection/discussions
[00:41:55] <Guest66> Not much is already there... But I guess I'll try, thank you )
