[09:50:33] <iamak[m]> > 
[09:50:33] <iamak[m]> > yet to print static content like man-pages, 'less' work just fine.
[09:50:33] <iamak[m]> I used the clear solution only xD
[09:50:36] <iamak[m]> I found this today
[09:51:13] <iamak[m]> I used it in [this](https://github.com/i-a-m-a-k/terminal-wordle)
[10:03:12] <relejek[m]> ‡§è‡§ï‡•á:  okay so it is an interactive TUI that takes input. you can't use less here. less is for read only.
[10:04:08] <iamak[m]> Yeah. I meant alternate buffers
[10:04:14] <iamak[m]> Like less and nvim uses

[11:48:43] <purpux> can someone tell me about nvim ? How is it different from vim ? Does it have any advantages compared to vim ?
[11:51:17] <AryaK[m]> faster, supports lua
[11:51:25] <AryaK[m]> and is community maintained
[12:18:09] <purpux> AryaK[m]: faster ? Do we have benchmarks ? Also is lua compulsory or is it just an integrated language ?
[12:19:00] <purpux> I just tried to compile neovim, and it wouldn't allow me to compile without lua also being compiled... I'm not sure I want lua on my system. Guess I'll skip neovim then :D
[12:19:18] <gtlsgamr> no huge difference bro
[12:19:21] <gtlsgamr> just use vim
[12:19:46] <gtlsgamr> in the end it is the modal editing that makes it worth it! And even vi provides it
