[01:52:30] <Videogamer555> There's 3 MPEG types of audio. MPEG1 audio with an MPG file extension, MPEG2 audio with an MP2 file extension, and MPEG3 audio with an MP3 file extension.
[01:54:18] <Videogamer555> I know that FFMPEG already can create MP2 and MP3 audio, but I want to be able to also have it write an MPG audio file, in order for its output to be compatible with much older media players (such as those present on Win95 or Win98). I'm sure that SOME people out there still use some of those old OSes for one reason or another (possibly to support older games or something).

[02:21:26] <Videogamer555> @Btbn that's too bad. I thought I remember it used to. Did that feature get removed? If this isn't possible now, please treat my question as a feature request. I know that FFMPEG can't nececarilly encode every new mode because of patent/license issues, but it surely should be able to encode every known old mode, especially ones that were in common use in the late 1990s and early 2000s, like
[02:21:26] <Videogamer555> MPEG1 audio.
[02:22:15] <BtbN> Well, patches welcome then. People interested enough in those ancient codecs are rare.
[02:22:26] <BtbN> Decoding it sure. But why would anyone want to still encode that stuff?
[02:23:19] <BtbN> And no, ffmpeg never had an encoder for mp1. Stuff like that doesn't get removed.
[02:24:21] <Videogamer555> Many old games used MPEG1 audio as the audio stream for in-game cutscenes (and of course they used MPEG1 video for the video stream, which I must emphasize is ALREADY implemented as a video encoder in FFMPEG), and the game would contain media-player code that would only be able to decode MPEG1 audio, not MPEG2 audio. Modding those games with user-made cut-scenes would require the encoding of
[02:24:21] <Videogamer555> MPEG1 audio.
[02:26:30] <Videogamer555> Why does FFMPEG support MPEG1 video, but not the accompanying MPEG1 audio? Most old MPG video files (including those used for cutscenes in games) would have an MPEG1 audio for the audio stream and MPEG1 video for the video stream. Modding the cut-scenes of old PC games requires FFMPEG outputing BOTH MPEG1 video ande MPEG1 audio. @BtbN
[02:27:01] <BtbN> Because nobody ever cared enough to write an encoder. Simple as that.
[02:27:43] <Videogamer555> When the MPEG1 project started, wasn't it still in the era where MPEG1 was common for both video and audio?
[02:27:55] <another|> You're welcome to write one.
[02:28:56] <BtbN> ffmpeg is an open source project. There is nobody sitting there, paid to add features people request to it. If you want a feature added, you either write it yourself and submit it, or pay someone to do that for you.
[02:29:08] <BtbN> Or somehow get a dev interested enough to do it for free.
[02:30:03] <Videogamer555> I don't even know the MPEG1 audio algorithm. Is that a publicly available specification? Or do I need to pay ISO (or some other standards company) a fee for the specification document (like I had to pay ISO for the TIFF/EP specification, which is a specific version of TIFF designed for digital photography).
[02:30:31] <BtbN> That's something whoever write an encoder would need to figure out, yes
[02:30:34] <BtbN> +s
[02:30:43] <Videogamer555> By the way that TIFF/EP specification cost me $200.
[02:31:06] <Videogamer555> I hope the MPEG1 audio specification doesn't cost that much, because I do intend to write an encoder for it.
[02:31:26] <Videogamer555> What is +s?
[02:31:31] <BtbN> The missing s.
[02:31:45] <BtbN> I'd be surprised if there isn't already multiple open source mp1 encoders out there.
[02:31:57] <BtbN> Just need to be careful not to poison yourself by readong one under the wrong license.
[02:32:01] <Videogamer555> Oh. I thought the "+s" was an IRC command.
[02:32:55] <JEEB> ISO/IEC is always ready to sell you stuff, they even made 14496-12 paid after almost 20 years of being free. this did not make the writers of that spec smile.
[02:32:56] <Videogamer555> Are you familiar with the MPEG1 audio specification? And who holds the rights to the specification document itself?
[02:33:00] <JEEB> they do have ITTF
[02:33:00] *** Joins: wuxi (~wuxi@61.155.23.114)
[02:33:14] <JEEB> but they are trying to limit which specs enter ITTf
[02:33:35] <JEEB> https://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/index.html
[02:34:25] <JEEB> Videogamer555: if you know the specification identifier you generally can find such specifications somewhere as a pdf.
[02:34:39] <Videogamer555> Are you familiar with the MPEG1 audio specification? And who holds the rights to the specification document itself?
[02:35:01] <JEEB> also if it happens to match some ITU spec identifier (usually H.XXX), that tends to possibly have it more likely officially for free
[02:35:18] <JEEB> MPEG-1 is part of ISO/IEC (although certain MPEG specs are co-work between ISO/IEC and ITU)
[02:35:38] <JEEB> also mpeg-1 audio comes in various layers as far as I can tell
[02:35:51] <JEEB> the thing that people know as "mp3" is mpeg-1 layer 3
[02:35:52] <JEEB> IIRC
[02:35:53] <another|> layer 3 used to be popular
[02:36:43] <Videogamer555> I think what I was calling MPEG1, MPEG2, and MPEG3 audio is actually MPEG1-Layer1, MPEG1-Layer2, and MPEG1-Layer3 audio.
[02:37:03] <JEEB> https://mpeg.chiariglione.org/standards/mpeg-1/audio
[02:37:17] *** Quits: wuxi (~wuxi@61.155.23.114) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[02:38:01] <JEEB> so MPEG-1 Part 3 if you specifically want layer 1. not sure if it got copied into MPEG-2 as well like MPEG-1 Layer 2 got
[02:38:12] <Videogamer555> Even so, not all MPEG1 audio players support Layer2 (aka MP2 audio file). And MP3 (MPEG1-Layer3) audio is basically treated as its own separate file format (featuing dedicated player hardware known as MP3 players).
[02:38:56] <JEEB> so this is the spec https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec:11172:-3:ed-1:v1:en
[02:39:03] <JEEB> 11172-3
[02:40:08] <JEEB> and by entering "11172-3 pdf" into a search engine I can find a CD of it right away at least
[02:40:43] <Videogamer555> I don't know if there is actually any such thing as MPEG2 audio. But MPEG2 video (which is a separate MPEG version entirely, not just Layer2 of MPEG1 video, and is used in digital TV transmission) actually use a different audio codec entirely called AC3.
[02:41:03] <JEEB> broadcast also commonly uses the MPEG-2 standardized MPEG-1 Layer 2
[02:41:10] <JEEB> at least in europe you can commonly see it
[02:41:18] <JEEB> together with AC-3 of course
[02:41:37] <JEEB> and my understanding is that MPEG-1 Layer 2 (if not all of MPEG-1 audio) got copied into MPEG-2
[02:42:29] <JEEB> yea let's see how similar 13818-3 is
[02:44:14] <JEEB> it's probably findable but not as easily as the mpeg-1 one it seems :)
[02:45:15] <JEEB> anyways, if you want to look at 11172-3 a draft (CD) version of it is available on the interwebs really easily if you just search for the name of the spec and pdf
[02:45:31] <JEEB> also it's old enough for multimedia.cx wiki to probably have an entry on the format
[02:48:34] <Videogamer555> What exactly is the difference between MPEG1 Layers 1 and 2 audio? Does Layer 2 just specify additional encoding techniques to make it better compressed, but in such a way that an MPEG1 Layer1 audio decoder can still decode it? Or do you need a Layer2 audio decoder for audio encoded with MPEG1 Layer2 codec?
[02:49:34] <JEEB> I think the spec is short enough for you to just scroll through it, since while I'm pretty sure it's just slight evolution/extension - that's the way to be sure
[02:50:01] <JEEB> fyi the draft I found was this url https://csclub.uwaterloo.ca/~pbarfuss/ISO11172-3.pdf
[02:50:11] <JEEB> seems to be a pdf export of an N document
[02:50:37] <JEEB> and yea, there's a description in bit that says "Layers"
[02:50:49] <Videogamer555> You said "if you want to look at 11172-3 a draft (CD)". What do you mean a CD? You mean I would need to order a hardcopy of the specification on CD-ROM disk?
[02:50:56] <JEEB> layer I is the basics, layer II "provides additional coding of bit allocation, scalefactors and samples. Different framing is used."
[02:51:15] <JEEB> CD is ISO/IEC lingo for "committee draft"
[02:52:16] <JEEB> https://www.iso.org/stage-codes.html
[02:52:31] <JEEB> not sure if it was as convoluted in the early 1990s
[02:52:38] <JEEB> nowadays it's CD, DIS, FDIS
[02:54:18] <JEEB> and I guess WD before that, but usually CD is the first thing you see in N documents
[03:02:47] <JEEB> anyways, g'night

[04:51:29] <LuKaRo_> My command line looks like this: ffmpeg -hwaccel cuda -hwaccel_output_format cuda -i in.ts -pixel_format yuv420p -c:a copy -c:v hevc_nvenc -cq 23 -vf scale_cuda=1920:1080 out.mkv
[04:52:14] <LuKaRo_> But no matter where I include -pix_fmt yuv420p or -profile:v main the output is always Main 10
[04:53:39] <BtbN> the pix_fmt is cuda
[04:53:57] <BtbN> You'll have to tell scale_cuda to convert to yuv420p hwframes.
[04:55:38] <LuKaRo_> Sounds reasonable! Any idea how to do that? Including format=... in the -vf option didn't work so far, but I'm probably just missing something?
[04:57:40] <BtbN> should work though, it's what the option to scale_cuda is called iirc
[05:03:58] <LuKaRo_> Hm, isn't format a separate filter that runs in software and not on the gpu?
[05:04:10] *** Joins: RougeR (~RougeR@user/rouger)
[05:09:49] <BtbN> the format "filter" is a meta-filter that triggers auto insertion of sw scale filters
[05:09:54] <BtbN> it doesn't work for hwframes
[05:10:10] <BtbN> scale_cuda should be able to do the format conversion you want, so you need to tell it your desired output format
[05:10:45] <LuKaRo_> Yeah, that would be awesome, I just don't know how to tell scale_cuda the output format. Is there appropriate documentation for it?
[05:11:43] <BtbN> The option really should be just called format
[05:11:54] <BtbN> format=nv12 or format=yuv420p should both do the trick
[05:13:19] <BtbN> https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#scale_005fcuda yeah, it's just format
[05:13:56] <LuKaRo_> -vf scale_cuda=1920:1080:format=yuv420p does not work though, it says: [Parsed_scale_cuda_0 @ 0x55f988b7ce40] Option 'format' not found
[05:14:32] <BtbN> What ffmpeg version is that?
[05:14:59] <LuKaRo_> ffmpeg version n4.4.1 on Arch Linux
[05:15:21] <BtbN> Yeah, that's too old. Get the latest version from master.
[05:16:14] <LuKaRo_> This is the first time an Arch Linux version is too old :D Must be a very recent feature then?
[05:16:46] <BtbN> almost to the day half a year old
[05:17:24] <LuKaRo_> On the git (https://git.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.git) it says, n4.4.1 is the recent version and 2 months old?
[05:17:38] <LuKaRo_> But if course, I'll try to build from master
[05:17:59] <BtbN> 4.4 is over half a year old
[05:19:40] *** Joins: wuxi (~wuxi@61.155.23.114)
[05:21:37] <LuKaRo_> Mhh, probably I'm missing something, because this commit https://git.ffmpeg.org/gitweb/ffmpeg.git/tag/2aa4f5cc8be5e3168191cd13a61178a167687eac dates to october.
[05:21:55] <LuKaRo_> But I'm already building:)
[05:22:04] <BtbN> Yes, a maintenance release of 4.4
[05:22:20] <BtbN> It doesn't backport every feature developed in the meantime
[05:22:44] <BtbN> You pretty much always want to use master, there's no reason to limit yourself to an outdated release.
[05:23:16] <LuKaRo_> Ah okay, now I get it! :)
[05:23:37] <LuKaRo_> Thanks for the information, I'll try to get master to work and use the "format" option of scale_cuda :)

[09:04:53] <robertparkerx> how do you convert dvdr/ntsc to x264 with ffmpeg ?
[09:05:01] <robertparkerx> I have raw files
[09:05:49] <robertparkerx> I mean I have iso
[09:06:49] *** Quits: wuxi (~wuxi@61.155.23.114) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[09:06:50] <jarthur> robertparkerx if the DVD is not encrypted, there's a script that comes with ffmpeg called dvd2concat. You'd need to have lsdvd installed to use it. Sadly, the best IFO/VOB demuxers are closed-source, IMO. e.g. MakeMKV or eac3to
[09:08:40] *** Joins: debayer (~debayer@75.115.113.138)
[09:09:07] <jarthur> So I will use one of those then use the resulting file as my ffmpeg input. If you decide to go the full open source route, dvd2concat will give you a file in the "concat" format you can then use in an ffmpeg -i  Googling dvd2concat will probably give you some examples.

[16:59:51] <jokoon> I need some clarification, because I was advised to convert inputs to the same FPS before concatenation, but apparently that's already what I do with those filters
[17:00:42] <BtbN> What are "those filters"?
[17:01:09] <BtbN> If you want to use the concat demuxer, all inputs need to be using the exact same parameters in all ways that matter.

[21:40:29] <JEEB> 25Hz is the default frame rate for various things, and in general you don't leave things without a container
[21:40:52] <JEEB> you'd have to look at which things the hevc raw reader & parser do
[21:41:47] <mindfreeze> JEEB: I thought to try the HEVC-HM reference codebase, and it turns out to be nightmare:)
[21:42:32] <JEEB> well, it's a reference encoder.
[21:42:44] <JEEB> you even have to give it the GOP as well as coded frame types you want manually
[21:42:46] <JEEB> in the config file
[21:42:54] <mindfreeze> yeah, I am doing that

[21:43:43] <mindfreeze> I thought the created bitstream have the fps metadata deep inside as some NAL units
[21:43:44] <JEEB> but yea, for best results just mux it into a container, or you'll just have to figure out which bit in FFmpeg isn't parsing far enough to get you the default duration/fps
[21:44:04] <JEEB> the frame rate field generally has a "max time base" kind of thing
[21:44:10] <JEEB> or well, gets converted to such
[21:44:19] <JEEB> which various muxers do interpret as "the frame rate"
[21:44:50] <JEEB> you can do codec copy and bsf trace_headers with vframes 3 or so
[21:44:54] <JEEB> and check the output
[21:44:59] <JEEB> it will dump you the NAL units' contents
[21:45:09] <JEEB> esp. the metadata ones

[21:47:45] <JEEB> yea that doesn't output what really interests you :D

[21:59:11] <JEEB> lol
[21:59:32] <JEEB> it definitely has some support for the parameter sets since I recall in ye olden 2012-2013 winter they had to fix how they wrote that stuff
