[18:05:25] <nimaje> that starting comment should at least say that this 'dirkf' himself is the new maintainer, not just "the project has a new maintainer." (at least that's how I understood it, but I couldn't find explicit references)
[18:08:47] <xx> whoever the new maintainer is, they'll likely burn out fast, because yt-dlp has a community around it now

[19:41:41] <armin> the comments section is an interesting read...
[19:49:50] <xx> yeah looks like nobody in the comments wants youtube-dl to be resurrected
[19:54:32] <armin> well slackware 15 was released 3 days ago, they still ship a 2.x python as /usr/bin/python in the default installation.
[19:54:44] <armin> and i believe debian still has python2, too.
[19:55:04] <armin> even though it's EOL since january 2020...
[19:55:10] <xx> debian did away with python2 in debian11
[19:55:20] <xx> it still exists, but has plenty of restrictions
[19:55:28] <armin> there's still a python-is-python3 package in debian
[19:55:33] <armin> is it not required anymore?
[19:55:46] <xx> it will always be required if you want ot use /bin/python
[19:55:52] <armin> ah
[19:56:01] <xx> because how is the system supposed to know what you mean by /bin/python
[19:56:06] <xx> is it 2? Is it 3?
[19:56:14] <armin> 3 i hope if 2 is EOL since 2 years
[19:56:18] <xx> so that package makes a symlink to /bin/python2 or /bin/python3
[19:56:24] <armin> yeh
[19:56:55] <armin> sorry i'm eating while we type, my arguments will be lo-fi
[19:57:00] <xx> and the debian guidelines forbid using /bin/python now anyway, everything is supposed to directly say whether it wants python2 or python3
[19:59:13] <armin> xx: but then again, old habits die hard, i only heard about yt-dlp 3 weeks ago or so for the first time!
[19:59:55] <xx> it's been out for a long time
[20:01:23] <xx> first release was over a year ago
[20:01:37] <xx> and youtube-dl was in trouble for longer than that
[20:02:18] <armin> i still have problems to memorize that name, what does the "p" stand for?
[20:02:59] <xx> no idea, maybe imProved
[20:03:45] <xx> probably a smart choice to not have 'youtube' in the name
[20:05:40] <armin> xx: then again, you're not even in #yt-dlp
[20:05:54] <xx> didn't know it exists :)
[20:05:57] <armin> oh :)
[20:06:20] <xx> thought this was just a general channel for all the youtube-dl forks
[20:07:11] <armin> xx: well you're the 2nd person now to tell me that youtube-dl is dead and that i should move on to yt-dlp :)
[20:07:45] <xx> armin: well read through the issues list on youtube-dl github and see for yourself
[20:08:26] <xx> yt-dlp even made it to debian repos and was backported to stable - it's rare for that to happen
[20:08:35] <xx> so it shows *very* high demand for it
[20:12:37] <armin> xx: i'm a bit shocked - it's not even in nixos 21.11 nix channel but in debian stable?
[20:13:40] <armin> xx: it's incredibly rare for a package for that to happen.
[20:14:50] * xx shrugs
[20:14:57] <xx> I don't know much about nix beyond that it exists
[20:15:08] <xx> it's all on pip anyway if you wanna get it that way
[20:15:13] <xx> and pip is on every linux distro
[20:15:22] <armin> tru
