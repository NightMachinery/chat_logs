[10:59:05] <moniker-> hey quick question, for quick answer if not too complicated, what you think of css framework like tails?
[11:00:14] <moniker-> is there much difference between css framework and other usual kinds like rails, angular, nodejs etc
[11:01:10] <moniker-> the general directional advice i kind of understood is when learning to stay away from frameworks to get good base first and only later on look into them
[11:02:20] <moniker-> so was wondering if same applies to css and framework like tails

[11:19:56] <hmw[at]> moniker-: This is just an opinion; First of all, get good with vanilla CSS first, before using frameworks and save a lot of headache. Secondly, I don't like tailwind because it tries to remove the thing that makes CSS what it is (the cascading part). Some people do like it, I think it is backwards.
[11:21:29] <hmw[at]> ah. Guess I should learn to read before typing :)
[11:21:34] <moniker-> you mean separation of style from data?
[11:21:46] <moniker-> it tries to remove
[11:22:09] <hmw[at]> That's one aspect I dislike in tails, but not the only. I enjoy using nesting and specificity in CSS, and tailwind is the other direction
[11:22:24] <moniker-> wait first i mispoke yes i meant tailwind
[11:22:32] <moniker-> not tails, tahts linux distro
[11:22:39] <hmw[at]> Yeah, I got that right
[11:22:49] <hmw[at]> Well. This is not a Linux channel after all :)
[11:23:13] <moniker-> ok then i suspected i might get this answer but it's good to confirm it, thx
[11:23:53] <hmw[at]> Still my opinion; When you learn and practice CSS proper first, you will be able to judge any framework on your own. Sometimes, it looks like those frameworks make your life easier, until they don't. If you can't go into the library and debug the framework yourself, you get a migraine
[11:24:01] <moniker-> hmw[at] if i can bother you for 1 minute more, what about css extension like sass
[11:24:19] <moniker-> is that something also best let for later?
[11:24:24] <hmw[at]> I personally don't use any framework, preprocessors, etc, I am a pure vanilly crazy guy.
[11:24:49] <moniker-> kk
[11:25:00] <hmw[at]> scss seems to be OK tho, from what I have seen. Not really neccessary. Well. Perhaps with huge web sites. I don't have experience with that.
[11:28:03] <hmw[at]> My approach is probably problematic, if you have to manage a huge web site with thousands of pages. Also, some people can produce results very quickly with their frameworks. Still, I recommend getting good with vanilla CSS until you can see for yourself, why you would want to use a certain framework
[11:29:00] <hmw[at]> moniker-: I also would like to recommend you go and get other opinions. I am indeed a little weird in my ways ;-)
[11:29:14] <moniker-> i do
[11:29:19] <moniker-> thx
[11:29:57] <hmw[at]> I forgot who you were; Was it the menu with the border-radius that needed an overflow?
[11:30:08] <hmw[at]> (overflow:hidden)
[11:30:26] <moniker-> i didn't ask anything specific
[11:30:30] <hmw[at]> ah ok
[11:30:37] <moniker-> so that must have been someone else
