[00:01:30] <W> brownorange, I mean (a or b) has a truth or falsity itself, yes? same as with (a) or (b)? Or is there something that disallows this?
[00:01:43] <riv> the second two are not functions
[00:02:03] <W> riv, there is context in the channel I'm afraid, this is pedagogic
[00:03:10] <brownorange> @W because the truth table is constructed around the output in relation to the inputs, not also each separately and together.
[00:03:42] <W> brownorange, what I'm trying to communicate here is that an expression, like !a, does not itself have an independent truth value. Its value /depends/ on the variables included in it
[00:04:51] <W> (a or !b or c or d or !e) in the same way depends on the five variables included, it is not independent. !(a or !b or c or d or !e) also depends on these five variables, and in fact depends on (a or !b or c or d or !e) itself
[00:06:23] *** Quits: trbp (~trbp@user/trbp) ()
[00:06:47] <brownorange> @W I think I agree.  but what !a manifests is still potentially different than 'a' by itself. notice that both are established before we do the inclusive-or operation. it's not like this is a singularity of var creation and logical computation
[00:06:49] <W> when you fill out a truth table with all of these expressions and variables, you do indeed not have all the boolean combinations, because that's not how logic works, by common agreement and history establishing such
[00:07:31] <W> brownorange, yes, !a is its own thing, it's just, this thing is dependent on a, and we can relate it to the value of a, and when the two are used in one expression this allows us to make deduction via the agreed upon rules of logic
[00:07:59] <W> one of those rules of logic is the law of excluded middle, stating that (a or !a) is true, no matter what we might think or know or have deduced or not about a
[00:08:22] <brownorange> is your point that (a or not a)  does not imply we've demonstrated either a, !a ?
[00:08:44] <W> no, but that is certainly also valid
[00:09:37] <brownorange> @W I am reminded of the confusion of logical implication.  Why is A implies A, doesn't violate our intuition, but A implies B, seems to?

[00:12:58] <isekaijin> Hello. I am analyzing the Du Val singularities of type A_n. They are locally isomorphic to C^2 / G, where C is the cyclic group of n+1 elements acting on C^2 by (x,y) |-> (kx, y/k), where k is an (n+1)-th root of unity. I have shown that a polynomial in C[x,y] is G-invariant if and only if its individual terms are G-invariant, and a monomial x^a y^b is G-invariant if and only if a-b is divisible by
[00:13:00] <isekaijin> n+1. Thus, the G-invariant monomials are of the form u^a v^b w^c, where u = x^(n+1), v = y^(n+1), w = xy.
[00:13:41] <brownorange> Not A implies Not A, but it implies way more than that.
[00:14:47] <brownorange> because of what prop-calc is the real difference comes down to truth. that's it.  (a or not !a)  should convince us of anything

[00:16:56] <isekaijin> Clearly, f(u,v,w) = u^2 y^2 - w^(n+1) always vanishes at every (u,v,w). I want to show that any other polynomial that vanishes at every (u,v,w) is a multiple of f. I have done so in a rather crude way.
[00:17:06] *** Joins: specing (~specing@user/specing)
[00:19:11] <brownorange> it's sad i'm not an intuitionist but i appear to be making intuitionist arguments
[00:19:32] <isekaijin> Namely, f is irreducible, hence V(f) is an irreducible surface in C^3. If there were another polynomial g (not a multiple of f) vanishing at every (u,v,w), then our orbit space C^2 / G would be containedin V(f,g), which is necessarily a curve. But, C^2 / G has to be a surface, because C[x,y] is an integral extension of C[x,y]^G, hence C^2 / G has the same dimension as C^2, which is 2.
[00:21:12] <W> brownorange, I explicitly made an anti-intuitionist argument earlier, paraphrasing Hilbert, and you didn't react or disagree, so perhaps not a very good one :p
[00:22:57] <isekaijin> I am not too satified with this approach “in broad strokes” to showing that f suffices to generate the polynomial relations among u,v,w. Is it possible to do this with a more straightforward calculation? Not appealing to generalities about topological dimension or the theory of integral extensions.

[02:22:46] <PlanckWalk> (and it's not terribly difficult)
[02:23:42] <cuppajoeman> The only idea I've had so far is that I need to map something from A to something from Q
[02:23:49] <cuppajoeman> So what if I just map f(a) = 0
[02:24:17] <PlanckWalk> In this case it's probably easier to go the other way around (which you can when you're constructing a bijection)
[02:24:38] <[itchyjunk]> idk how to even apply the def to this

[02:25:38] <cuppajoeman> If its the opposite direction
[02:25:39] <[itchyjunk]> so i have lim z->z_0 f(z)/(z-z_0) - f(z_0)/z-z_0

[02:26:00] <[itchyjunk]> oh hmm

[03:05:32] <PlanckWalk> They're not really "alternatives" anyway.  They are all (including ZFC) just different systems studied in mathematics.
[03:06:01] <PlanckWalk> There is no single formal system that covers "all of mathematics"
[03:06:17] <tusko> if a^{(p-1)/2} ≡ -1 (mod p), where p is an odd prime, then p | a^{(p-1)/2} + 1. Also put x = a^{(P-1)/2} and x^2 ≡ a^{p-1} ≡ 1 (mod p) by FLT since a \in 1 <= a <= p-1 and p !| a. So, by extension p | a^{(p-1)} - 1.
[03:06:20] <brownorange> sure. but getting to my point. the very statements that are source of undecidables are the ones that allow truth and provability to mix together

[03:09:13] <PlanckWalk> (Assuming ZFC is consistent)
[03:09:31] <tusko> or rather x^2 ≡ 1 (mod p) => p | x^2 - 1 => p | (x + 1)(x - 1) and so p|(x+1) or p|(x-1).
[03:09:37] <brownorange> @PlankWalk either a wff got produced which could refer to its own provability or not

[03:28:09] <PlanckWalk> Right.  So if  a^((p-1)/2) = 1 (mod p),  then a is not a generator.
[03:28:30] <PlanckWalk> Because the least n such that a^n = 1 (mod p) is not p-1.
[03:28:54] <tusko> mm, I see. Because that's the only way it generates the group. It makes sense

[04:11:36] <brownorange> @PlanckWalk a provability predicate is a truth predicate
[04:12:40] <PlanckWalk> No, it isn't.
[04:13:45] <PlanckWalk> A truth predicate is a predicate in a language that can represent statements, and evaluates true iff the argument is true.
[04:14:27] <PlanckWalk> A provability predicate is a predicate in a language that can represent statements, and evaluates true iff the argument is provable.

[04:19:25] <brownorange> @PlanckWalk did Tarski convince you of this
[04:19:26] <PlanckWalk> Actually where I said "argument is true" and "argument is provable" I should say "the argument represents a true statement" and "argument represents a provable statement" respectively.
[04:19:57] <PlanckWalk> Convince me of which of the many statements I have made?
[04:20:22] <brownorange> That predicates aren't truth predicates
[04:20:32] <PlanckWalk> His work certainly formed part of some of them, sure.
[04:20:41] <brownorange> do you think only True(x) or False(x) are truth predicates?
[04:21:07] <PlanckWalk> What exactly do you mean by those symbols?

[04:24:12] <brownorange> so these are truth predicates, true/false?  truth is about truth as in bivalent truth
[04:24:36] <PlanckWalk> Sometimes they can be qualified such as True(x,M) means that x represents a true statement of model M.
[04:25:10] <PlanckWalk> There are also different ways to represent statements, and each corresponds to a different predicate.
[04:25:22] <PlanckWalk> So no, there's not just one.
[04:25:54] <brownorange> ok good. then why is Prov(x) where if x is provable, return true, else return false, not also a truth predicate?

[04:27:30] <PlanckWalk> For PA, they are definitely different.

[04:27:40] <PlanckWalk> Yes, for ZFC they're definitely different too.
[04:28:06] <brownorange> and what convinced you of that? Godel's theorems and Tarski?
[04:28:12] <PlanckWalk> No
[04:28:29] <PlanckWalk> Though those are adequate.
[04:29:18] <brownorange> But my point is in Godel's case Prov(x) would be a truth predicate. and if you're not presuming it is, on what basis? that the result you can obtain contradicts it?"
[04:29:54] <PlanckWalk> More directly, there are nonstandard models of PA and multiple known propositions that are independent of ZFC.
[04:30:26] <PlanckWalk> Even without Gödel's theorems those are *constructions* that exhibit the difference.

[05:01:50] <PlanckWalk> brownorange: That's exactly the current condition.  We know that every (sufficiently powerful) formal system doesn't have theorems for every wff.
[05:02:02] <Nickssen> also, in the problem: Is f(z) = z/ z^4 + 16 for all z such that ||z|| <2 continuous. does it make sense to just say that the denominator doesn't have problems in the domain to justify that it's continuous?
[05:02:13] <PlanckWalk> E.g. Neither CH nor ~CH is a theorem of ZFC.
[05:02:24] <PlanckWalk> Neither Goodstein nor ~Goodstein is a theorem of PA.

[05:03:44] <frelleck> Nickssen basically
[05:04:16] <frelleck> there's an algebraic continuity theorem which says products, sums, etc of continuous functions are continuous
[05:04:18] <frelleck> that's what you're using
[05:04:36] <frelleck> (and the fact the denominator doesn't blow up)
[05:04:57] <Nickssen> aha right, all the functions are continuous in the given domain thus the composition or sum or whatever is too

[06:07:56] <brownorange> @PlanckWalk it's as true as l.e.m is though
[06:08:00] <PlanckWalk> Nope.
[06:08:14] <brownorange> (a or not a),  that's a tautology
[06:08:29] <PlanckWalk> LEM says that  Prov(a) or ~Prov(a)  is true.
[06:08:52] <PlanckWalk> It *doesn't* say that  Prov(a) or Prov(~a)  is true.
[06:09:17] <brownorange> "|- Prov(a) or Prov(!a)" is different than "|- Prov(a) or |- Prov(!a)"
[06:10:09] <brownorange> all to defend the logical consistency of this.  "|- Prov(a) or Prov(!a)" is not as scary as it looks because it's only saying we have a proof that 'a' or '!a' is provable. it does not  claim we have a definitely proof of either
[06:11:19] <brownorange> @PlanckWalk you can ignore l.e.m. i'm saying the obvious point that we have a proof that a is provable, or !a is provable. not a specific declaration of which is provable
[06:12:23] <brownorange> separately l.e.m then justifies this

[06:17:50] <brownorange> PlanckWalk the proof itself has no premises. just a definition, and a rule of inference you don't like
[06:18:28] <PlanckWalk> Yes, I'm including the inference rule in the premises.
[06:18:34] <PlanckWalk> (Which can always be done)
[06:19:16] <brownorange> Let's try a proof by contradiction instead. suppose that we do not have a proof of 'a', and we do not have a proof of '!a'.  that should be impossible in propositional logic and 'a' be an wff
[06:19:56] <PlanckWalk> "Should be" isn't a proof.
[06:20:14] <PlanckWalk> (And it's false anyway)

[06:21:14] <PlanckWalk> Completeness of propositional logic doesn't mean what you think it means.
[06:21:32] <brownorange> it means for all wffs, a is provable, or !a is provable

[06:43:44] <HenryTheLongshot> Ah OK makes sense

[06:45:00] <HenryTheLongshot> PlanckWalk: yep

[08:18:02] <cads> I would personally see if reducing things to un-named tuples helps you with speed and accuracy (for me they help immensely), but otherwise, you seem to be doing well
[08:18:06] <Simplar> Suppose there is a vector c. Angles between vector c and vectors i and j are 60° and 135° respectively. Find the angle between vectors c and k.

[08:59:55] <cherim> Put the 4 fake girls at x=0 line. Then each of 4 non-vertical classes gives you a daily schedule if you drop a fake girl from every line (4-1=3).

[15:14:25] <rubiksdream> greenbagels oh in any case, I managed to prove what I originally wanted to, say D is a open+connected subset of C^, and it contains only one boundary point, WLOG suppose this boundary point is infinity, then D is a simply connected open subset of the plane, and we claim it contains all of its limit points in the plane, indeed if z is a limit point of D in the plane it cannot be a boundary point, so it must be an interior point of D, but then D is
[15:14:25] <rubiksdream> clopen as a subset of the plane, the plane is connected, so D must be the entire plane, this contradicts the fact that C^ - D has at least two points

[18:55:11] <Vornicus> LiftLeft: this is called a Voronoi Diagram
[18:56:55] <buster> LiftLeft, the usual Voronoi algorithm should work. You'll use the 3d version of the algorithm, then translate the resulting planes into great circles. The planes will all pass through the centre of the sphere provided the input points are all on the surface of the sphere.
[19:00:57] <buster> transforming the collection of great circles into a collection of spherical polygons might be quite painful if you want to do it programatically for arbitrary inputs. but not dramatically harder conceptually than it already is for the simple case of points in a flat 2d plane.

[20:59:23] <W> When looking at the relative phases (arguments) of (harmonic) frequencies in a Fourier transform of a periodic signal, it is dependent on the time picked as 0. Will multiplying the Fourier transform by e^(iPf) (where P is the period, f the frequency) correctly correct for this, so the phase difference between frequencies becomes independent of time shift? I think so but my brain is in low gear atm.

[21:56:42] <Z-module> it's already general
[21:56:51] <cuppajoeman> WHen it was introduced to me they said the principle of well ordering is that every finite subset of the natural numbers has a least element
[21:57:18] <cuppajoeman> But it's more general than this I suppose
[21:57:18] <Z-module> that's wrong
[21:57:22] <cuppajoeman> Oh ok
[21:57:46] <Z-module> in a linear ordering, every nonempty subset has a least element, period. That's independent of well-ordering.
[21:57:55] <Z-module> sorry, every finite nonempty subset
[21:58:22] <Z-module> for example, every finite subset does in the example I write a minute ago
[21:58:30] <Z-module> but the set as a whole has no least element
[21:58:53] <cuppajoeman> And least element in this case means that there is an element a in the subset st a R x for every other x in the subset?
[21:58:58] <Z-module> yes
[21:59:45] <cuppajoeman> So your example
[21:59:52] <cuppajoeman> 5 << 4 << 3 << 2 << 1 << 0
[22:00:08] <cuppajoeman> Then if you take a finite subset of N
[22:00:14] <Z-module> I should clarify: it's not wrong to say that every finite subset of N (usual ordering) has a least element, if it's nonempty. But that's purely by N being a linear ordering, nothing to do with it being a well-ordering.
[22:00:24] <cuppajoeman> Yeah
[22:00:53] <cuppajoeman> I untuitively understand that we can find such a least element since we can compare each element
[22:00:59] <cuppajoeman> since it's a linear order

[22:25:32] <Z-module> Not sure what you quite intend by "direct". Consider this: list all the distinct elements x_1, ..., x_n  in some arbitrary order. Now set m = x_1. If n is 1, then this m is the smallest (only) element. Otherwise, check which of m <= x_2, x_2 <= m holds -- exactly one must be true. In the latter case only, redefine m to be x_2.  If n = 2 we're done, otherwise, consider which of m <= x_3, x_3 <= m holds; etc.   At the end of these
[22:25:32] <Z-module> finitely many steps, m will be the smallest element.

[22:51:03] <cuppajoeman> ok cool. So in that question they also seem to specify some time interval?
[22:51:05] <qergle> hard to get motivated thinking about a super-biased coin getting flipped forever.
[22:51:53] <qergle> ok, so two per minute, what's your λ
[22:52:20] <cuppajoeman> So they're saying lambda represents the rate - not sure why yet - but in that case lambda = 2?

[23:03:08] <qergle> there's no reason to expect non-indep across minutes
[23:03:28] <qergle> why not set a unit of time that makes answering easiest?
[23:03:33] <cuppajoeman> Ok, let's make our time interval 2 minutes
[23:03:43] <qergle> ok, now what is λ?
[23:03:52] <cuppajoeman> In that case calls are arriving at a rate of 4 per 2 minute

[23:18:32] <cuppajoeman> Ah right
