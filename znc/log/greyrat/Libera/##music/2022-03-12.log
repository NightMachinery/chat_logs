[00:31:10] <artao> i have, for over 20 yrs, had a book of transcriptions of Louis Armstrong
[00:31:21] <artao> i've long found it very hard to read properly
[00:31:36] <artao> it suddenly occurred to me to look song up on youtube to HEAR them
[00:31:51] <artao> and yeah. reading along while listening, it's SO much simpler
[00:32:06] <artao> and really not that difficult
[00:32:29] <artao> it's just hard to read cuz of the swing. tons of tied notes and triplets tied to dotted 1/16th notes and shit
[00:32:56] <artao> which is to say, in general: transcriptions of jazz music are hard to read
[00:33:02] <artao> even if they're easy to play
[00:33:40] <Gerula> you can get a tab software, and the internet is full of tabs
[00:33:48] <Gerula> very easy to follow along
[00:33:50] <artao> oh
[00:33:52] <artao> trumpet
[00:33:56] <artao> no tabs for trumpet
[00:34:10] <Gerula> ehhh
[00:34:33] <artao> i should probably put the Bb tuning slide back in if i'm'a gonna start playing off sheet music
[00:34:59] <artao> my trumpet is a Bb/C .. it has a removable section that puts it in Bb and in C without it
[00:35:05] <artao> pretty cool and fairly unique
[00:35:22] <artao> nickle plated too. so it stays shiny like silver but doesn't tarnish
[00:35:23] <Gerula> a quick search reveals plenty of trumpet tabs
[00:35:33] <artao> dafuq is a trumpet tab? o.O
[00:35:39] <artao> OH
[00:35:40] <Gerula> what is a tab?
[00:35:41] <artao> the fingerings?
[00:35:45] <Gerula> no
[00:36:01] <artao> yeah
[00:36:10] <artao> you mean like this ya
[00:36:11] <Gerula> music intro readable format, tablature
[00:36:11] <artao> http://easymusic.altervista.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/A_021.gif
[00:36:23] <Gerula> yes
[00:36:36] <artao> i've never thought of that as tab LOL ... but yeah, i guess it is
[00:36:51] <Gerula> tens of thousands online for all instruments
[00:36:56] <artao> with brass instruments it's generally calle d fingering chart or something. i've never heard it called tab
[00:36:58] <artao> interesting
[00:37:24] <morlog> corn
[00:37:25] <artao> that's really just for learning tho. the fingering is quite simple. it repeats at sensible intervals
[00:37:59] <artao> a B is always middle valve only. F is always first valve only, etc
[00:38:06] <artao> so you really don't need to learn that many fingerings
[00:38:09] <artao> heh heh
[00:38:11] <artao> fingering
[00:38:27] <artao> but then i see there's this
[00:38:30] <artao> oh nvm
[00:38:35] <artao> that's guitar
[00:38:41] <artao> i just read trumpet LOL D'oh
[00:40:13] <artao> i am startin to get my lips back tho, so it's about time to start doing real practice from exercises in books
