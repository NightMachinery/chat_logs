[00:49:51] <Bayes> why on fucking earth am I losing my time with word :(
[00:51:45] <danshearer> Bayes, pandoc will convert from Word pretty reliably to $other_thing
[00:51:54] <Bayes> yeah it's not that really
[00:52:15] <Bayes> it's just that I happen to have some collaborators that thought that submitting a journal that asks you for a word document is a good thing
[00:52:25] <danshearer> And if its about the collaborative comments, I have seen them work well with Collabora
[00:53:07] <Bayes> and now all the nice tables and stuff I have need a lot of effort to be dumped in this file
[00:53:43] <Bayes> doesn't help that I don't have office locally, since I'm on linux, and so I'm using office online which seems to be missing more than one feature
[00:57:27] <Bayes> also, been working on this crap for six month
[00:57:32] <Bayes> and all they say is "The data was analyzed for collinearity. " xD
[00:57:48] <Bayes> I'd like to think we've been doing more than /just/ that
[01:02:22] <confuzeus> lol. there is still lots of people who use track changes. comments on a pdf document require special skills.
[01:08:47] <confuzeus> are you collaborators going for a low hanging journal? to ramp up the publications?

[01:13:12] <Bayes> no
[01:13:49] <Bayes> it's just that this grant funds agriculture research, and the agriculture journals want word files :/
[01:14:14] <mefistofeles> :\
[01:14:26] <mefistofeles> well, as long as it gets the job done, I guess
[01:16:51] <Bayes> yeah, that's what we all keep telling ourselves
[01:18:23] <Bayes> also, I purposely did not include point estimates in our internal stuff but intervals for the quantities of interests, but of course they want to report the point estimate :D
[01:19:14] <confuzeus> apart from the funding requirements, i would think it should be easier to get the paper in than the same paper in an stats/applied journal.
[01:20:26] <Bayes> I agree, I personally think stat journals are way more taxing than agriculture
[01:20:32] <Bayes> at least from what I've seen these years
[01:21:27] <Bayes> stat journals expect quite a large chunk of content, when they accept a paper they're typically fairly comprehensive in their treatment
[01:21:53] <Bayes> agriculture is more like "I've collected these data, fit these models, A is significant but B isn't, end of message"

[16:31:21] <Bayes> confuzeus yeah so I typically don't include point estimates and report CI directly
[16:32:28] <Bayes> if the point estimate is something small like .2 with a CI -3 3, not few people are inclined to think of it as "there's a small difference although no significant"
[16:32:51] <Bayes> but deep down they'll think of it as observing a small difference
[16:33:19] <Bayes> and they'll keep bringing it back in the future as... "oh yeah we once observed a positive difference, it was small"
[16:33:53] <Bayes> and they'll write things as "we observed a small difference of .2 but it was not significant"
[16:34:04] <Bayes> and so they keep just repeating that .2 which is purely random
[16:34:25] <Bayes> could be -.2, could be .1, etc... that .2 is not really meaningful itself
[16:34:53] <Bayes> same with plots, I try to plot CI as bars without the point estimate (typically a dot in the middle) to avoid the same
[16:35:52] <fendur> i usually a put a dot in there, but i also try to put a thicker line as the 50% interval
[16:36:06] <fendur> along with a 95% interval as a thinner line
[16:36:37] <fendur> so im sort of pointing to the more likely locations
[16:38:21] <Bayes> yeah I don't know
[16:38:52] <Bayes> the worst is when you have results like .5 for estimate and (-.1, 1.1) for interval
[16:39:13] <Bayes> cause many people will say it's "not significant"
[16:39:38] <Bayes> but they also kind of feel inside the urge to point that the interval is roughly including zero
[16:39:41] <fendur> yep people like their rules for thinking :)
[16:39:58] <fendur> and then they like to defy them when it suits them :P
[16:40:21] <fendur> as you just said
[16:40:29] <Bayes> and then my answer would be... sure, let's just compute the prob that this value is > 0 so you just do the math trick to invert intervals and such and say "there's 90% prob that it's greater than zero!"
[16:40:35] <Bayes> and everyone will cheer up
[16:41:05] <Bayes> but the it's kind of a lie cause a priori they wouldn't have bet their money on the quantity being _larger_ than zero
[16:41:16] <Bayes> and they just wanted to know if it was different from zero
[16:41:26] <fendur> that will require a change in theinking too, though, because people will try to convert that to their preferred "significant or not" mode
[16:41:45] <Bayes> so subreptitiously changing the null won't do it
[16:42:21] <Bayes> well it's not really about how my vs their rules of thinking
[16:42:45] <Bayes> it's that an interval, be it credible or confidence, have a very specific meaning
[16:43:27] <Bayes> and some will bend it when they interpret it rather informally
[16:43:32] <Bayes> hence why I avoid reporting it
[16:43:39] <fendur> objectively, yeah. im saying people will largely just try to make sense of it in THEIR training/preferred way of thinking
[16:44:15] <Bayes> to deter a non-pedantic non-statistical scientist making a quick interpretation as much as I can
[16:44:16] <fendur> no matter how you say it. or they'll dismiss it because it's too different from their own training
[16:47:50] <Bayes> typically, if I can, I'll just report it as "there's a X probability that thing A is not associated with a _bad hypothesis_ on thing B"
[16:48:14] <Bayes> AFAIK that's the cleanest, simplest, most rigorous way to report it
[16:48:43] <Bayes> I think... cause all this crap is highly complex after all
[16:56:39] <danshearer> Because "people deviate from rationality when it comes to probability", especially when putting others in prison: https://www.jstor.org/stable/41653676
[16:56:56] <fendur> by the way, i was thinking from the perspective of applied researchers who are not necessarily well trained in stats and probability
[17:00:21] <danshearer> Well I am definitely not well trained. I also sometimes have to advise on decisions related to probability. I have collected papers like this (direct link https://web.archive.org/web/20170809093702/http://www1.fee.uva.nl/creed/pdffiles/judicialfactfindingTI.pdf )
[17:01:29] <fendur> nice thanks danshearer 
[17:03:02] <danshearer> I know that I don't have an intuitive understanding of probability, and I know that if I apply the processes I have learned then the results will still need interpreting. People often involved in court decisions are applied researchers like you describe, and their conclusions are further modified through falsely deterministic legal algorithms. 
[17:06:25] <Bayes> danshearer http://167.71.158.10:3838/pvalue/ from https://github.com/jarad/pvalue is a more "intuitive" tool, and I'm quoting intuitive cause it's as intuitive as it gets
[17:07:06] <Bayes> also slides 7-8 https://github.com/jarad/pvalue2019/blob/master/pvalue2019.pdf
[17:07:12] <Bayes> not my material just to be clear
[17:08:08] <Bayes> "The probability the null is true conditional on a particular p-value dependson a few unknowable values" is the coup de grace
[17:10:54] <Bayes> funny that you mention "people deviate from rationality when it comes to probability" cause ET Jaynes presents probability as the natural consequence of logic
[17:11:06] <Bayes> I can't find a good quote at the moment unfortunately
[17:12:25] <danshearer> Bayes, I hope someone would not *only* say ""The probability the null is true conditional on a particular p-value depends on a few unknowable values", but also, "We don't know, but we can give you some boundaries for the problem, and we can give you some homework to go and research."
[17:13:25] <danshearer> Then ET Jaynes has an issue wish a great deal of repeatable psychology work.
[17:13:33] <danshearer> *with
[17:15:27] <fendur> that probability is a natural consequence of logic doesn't mean people should understand probability.
[17:15:30] <danshearer> I cannot reliably interpret statistical models, although a researcher can lead me by the nose. But I do know that Abduction is effectively equivalent to the Affirmation of the Consequent, and abduction is a large part of the scientific method, and the scientific method is the best we have.
[17:15:34] <Bayes> heh that's very noble and I agree wholeheartedly that we need to do more than simply pointing out at the limitations of p-values (which seems to be beyond the scope of that presentation so the author of that material is not to blame I guess). But most of the non-statistical scientists I've been known so far are more like... "I'm gonna italic all
[17:15:35] <Bayes> significant at .1 and bold all significant and .05 in my table, I'm gonna mention those in the manuscript, and I'll come up with a one-sentence summary that I shall use for the paper title"
[17:16:39] <danshearer> Therefore, when $science-based-statistical-method presents a result to me, I presume that a period of abductive thought was the precursor to that, and I am already suspicious.
[17:16:46] <Bayes> yeah also let's not blame ET Jaynes on this cause I was loosely quoting their work top off my head, so what I said might not be 100% accurate of their view
[17:17:41] <fendur> i can get behind "$cience"
[17:18:14] <Bayes> XD  I think $science-based-statistical-method is not meant to actually mean business interests but a variable?
[17:18:17] <Bayes> or so I read it
[17:18:32] <fendur> i'll interpret that how i please, thank you :)
[17:18:38] <danshearer> ah yes, variable. I might be the computing person in the room ok
[17:19:12] <Bayes> well I was just pointing out how the message was sent, of course you're free to read it as you please
[17:19:32] <fendur> im just goofing off. proceed with your discussion
[17:19:45] <danshearer> fendur, of course of course. You are free to interpret it as meaning "hot fried frogs" if you wish.
[17:20:06] <Bayes> oh man all this talk made me realize how little I know about the work of Jaynes and Shannon :/
[17:20:15] <danshearer> A lot more than me mate

[18:04:40] <confuzeus> personally, i think you are doing science a disservice if you only report confidence or prediction intervals. you are no different to someone who report the point estimate only. i think the best is to present point estimates together with the intervals. i cannot imagine some policymaker being able to utilise their resources optimally if they had to make decisions based on a range. since confidence intervals need not be symmetrical, 
[18:04:40] <confuzeus> presenting point estimates will help decision makers. 
[18:07:58] <fendur> i tend to agree. i think the discussion section is where you talk about proper contextualized interpretation. the results section should include as much information as is digestible and allowable about the results.

[19:06:58] <fendur> nothing wrong with either of those or using an interactive session run from the shell (i.e., "R")
[19:07:16] <fendur> an IDE (like RStudio) is just nice sometimes
[19:07:30] <since_> its typing itself into the repl and shows the commands it is executing :D
[19:08:58] <since_> i often use R and then source("program.r") to debug with a browser() REPL
[19:09:23] <since_> maybe theres a method that is doing the same but not so cumbersome as in requiring initial source() input
[19:14:20] <ns12> Is there a convention for R file extensions? Is it .R or .r?
[19:16:54] <fendur> check for a style guide somewher. i feel like the one i referenced recently suggested .R, but either way, just be consistent.

[20:42:17] <Bayes> yo fendur I was thinking on this the other day I figured I could the opinion of an e-colleague
[20:43:09] <Bayes> imagine the nice and neat situation where you have a cross-over of all levels in two factors, factor1 x factor2
[20:43:35] <Bayes> keep the model simple, say lm with factor1*factor2
[20:44:36] <Bayes> classical statistics is all about the K-1 representation for identifiability, but  using a bayesian framework we can use priors to help break some symmetries here
[20:45:25] <Bayes> so I'm wondering, why not just an additive model with one beta per level and all coefficients centered around zero
[20:46:11] <Bayes> instead of having to interpret all stuff based on a reference level because full rank, and then typically computing marginal means (lsmeans or whatever you call them)
[20:46:43] <Bayes> I mean you should get to the same results it just feels more direct
[20:47:32] <Bayes> confuzeus I appreciate your comment, I'll reconsider but the times I reported both point estimate and intervals basically anyone in the room would take both but have the point estimate front
[20:48:45] <Bayes> and everyone starts getting that urge for repeating the experiment and see if you can reproduce and it's p-hackers all the way down
[20:53:07] <Bayes> that said, this is related to another feeling I've been having lately which is that I'm not very happy with the way people are doing applied sciences -- at least not in my current context --, so maybe it's time to move on

[22:28:01] <fendur> but also where people will try to use the work for practical purposes.
