[21:12:46] <fantazo> why was prolog chosen as the base for erlang? was it simply becaus it was trendy at the time?
[21:22:48] *** Joins: rgrinberg (~textual@2806:101e:7:6946:a872:19a1:2e93:fad2)
[21:29:11] <darkling> Was Prolog ever trendy? :)
[21:33:48] <rkallos> fantazo: allegedly the history is that they tried implementing proof-of-concept telephony systems in a bunch of different languages, and they found that the prolog implementation was 'best'.

[22:04:43] <fantazo> rkallos: I wonder which ones they tried. I see no difference of lisp and prolog. I find lisp code more readable and prolog has always some kind of unreadability about it.
[22:06:15] <fantazo> the argument I read so far was that they implemented it incrementally and what not and did it interactively. things which can be all said about lisp too. 
[22:07:20] <fantazo> writing a parser in lisp for lisp would be a way more easy task than writing a parser for prolog in prolog. but maybe I'm missing something. I never got warm enough with prolog to judge it.

[22:23:28] <kilian> it's mainly the syntax that comes from prolog, or what remainded from the initial prototypes
[22:24:27] <rkallos> I find lisp to be pretty readable, but I've been made to understand that not everybody feels that way. One of the creators of Erlang, Robert Virding, is actively working on Lisp Flavored Erlang; https://lfe.io
[22:34:59] <fantazo> rkallos: right, therefore I wonder especially that it wasn't a lisp in the first place. and that virding pushed lfe later.
[22:35:29] <fantazo> sadly I still couldn't get lfe running, somehow it doesn't fit with the new erlang version I have here.
[22:36:48] <fantazo> that's the sad thing about things which are hosted on different language systems. when lfe doesn't work for some reason, then you need to know the underlying platform by heart to even debug it.
[22:36:58] <fantazo> and my erlang-foo is not good enough.
[22:44:02] <rkallos> fantazo: Maybe I can help? What issues are you running in to when trying to get lfe working?
[22:49:36] <fantazo> rkallos: I tried to use it with rebar3, I got to install and create a project directory, but then 'rebar3 lfe repl' failed with a compiler error.
[22:50:52] <rkallos> Can you paste the error here, as well as what versions of Erlang & LFE you're using?
[22:53:04] *** Quits: phaleth (~phaleth@user/phaleth) (Quit: phaleth)
[22:56:57] <fantazo> rkallos: Erlang (SMP,ASYNC_THREADS) (BEAM) emulator version 12.1.2, lfe plugin rebar3_lfe (0.3.0), rebar3.config: lfe, "2.0.0"
[23:01:05] <fantazo> from what I looked into the issue I concluded, that it seems to me that lfe wasn't yet adapted to this erlang version. But I could be wrong.
[23:27:52] <rkallos> I've been playing around locally, and I've run into an issue with rebar3_lfe 0.3.x calling a function in rebar3 with the wrong number of arguments. It looks like it's been fixed in rebar_lfe 0.4.x, though
[23:30:05] <fantazo> rkallos: hmm, thanks. I'll try that.
[23:35:17] <rkallos> Yup. That seems to have fixed it for me. I changed ~/.config/rebar3/rebar.config to use {branch, "0.4.x"} for the rebar3_lfe plugin, then I ran 'rebar3 plugins upgrade rebar3_lfe', making sure that 'rebar3 plugins list' shows that it's using 0.4.0, then I was able to create a new lfe project and start a repl. Let me know if it works for you :)
[23:36:10] <jjhoo> fantazo: have you tried something like "git clone https://github.com/lfe/lfe; cd lfe; make compile; ./bin/lfe"?
[23:42:53] <fantazo> rkallos: when doing that I got this error: ===> Failed to fetch and copy dep: {git,"https://github.com/lfe-rebar3/rebar3_lfe.git", {branch,"0.4.x"}}
[23:42:56] <fantazo> that's weird.
[23:43:01] <fantazo> jjhoo: that worked.
[23:50:50] <rkallos> fantazo: I believe the repo should be https://github.com/lfe/rebar3_lfe
[23:51:45] <rkallos> And the branch should be "release/0.4.x". My bad :)
