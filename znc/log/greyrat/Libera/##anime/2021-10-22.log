[00:16:40] <JesseDesu> i picked the wrong course
[00:16:44] <JesseDesu> fuck this
[00:16:50] <MootPoot> return it
[00:16:52] <MootPoot> try again
[00:18:47] <MootPoot> If you think you can learn something as indepth as 3d modelling and just spend your entire time having choice fear over what learning resources you use.... it ain't gonna work
[00:18:57] <MootPoot> even if the course is not exactly what you want, stick with it
[00:19:26] <JesseDesu> ok thanks dad
[00:19:28] <MootPoot> gotta learn to walk before you figure out how to breakdance
[00:19:35] <MootPoot> lol
[00:19:47] <ButterNoodle> gotta learn to suck before u learn to fuck
[00:19:49] <MootPoot> ^
[00:19:54] <MootPoot> it is dad advice but its true
[00:20:09] <MootPoot> all of us IT people who ever learned something on our own have the same story
[00:20:18] <MootPoot> theres no perfect guide
[00:21:34] <MootPoot> I'm finally done

[00:27:44] <JesseDesu> mootpoot i want to learn as fast as possible
[00:27:51] <JesseDesu> so i need to cut through the bullshit
[00:28:01] <MootPoot> you see right
[00:28:13] <MootPoot> the only way you learn fast is by spending more time
[00:28:20] <Jigsy> Study for 48 hours a day, 14 days a week.
[00:28:31] <JesseDesu> 3D modeling is basically sculpture, which i already know how to do
[00:28:34] <MootPoot> There is no bullshit to cut through - its foundational knowledge
[00:28:38] <JesseDesu> i took many classes
[00:28:51] <beaky> modeling vtuber
[00:29:03] <JesseDesu> yea
[00:29:04] <ButterNoodle> I want to model one to the shape of my PP
[00:29:04] <MootPoot> everything is basically something else - if you basically knew how to do it, why aren't you already able to do it?
[00:29:23] <JesseDesu> rote memorization of keyboard shortcuts is also something i know how to do
[00:29:30] <MootPoot> then get to it
[00:29:54] <JesseDesu> mootpoot, pissing is basically shitting
[00:30:00] <JesseDesu> and shitting is pissing
[00:30:00] <ButterNoodle> out ur dick
[00:30:05] <MootPoot> If you know how to do a lot of stuff already you should be able to just watch 2x or 3x speed the ones you already know
[00:30:06] <JesseDesu> and sculpture is 3D modeling
[00:30:07] <ButterNoodle> out ur ass
[00:30:08] <MootPoot> and be able to do it
[00:30:19] <JesseDesu> udemy doesnt have 2x speed like youtube does
[00:30:51] <JesseDesu> also if there was a way to americanize all the accents
[00:31:01] <ButterNoodle> thats racist
[00:31:02] <JesseDesu> it would make it so much more pleasant to listen to

[00:32:46] <JesseDesu> i returned the class already

[00:35:42] <JesseDesu> i have something specific in mind and i have to cherry pick my learning resources
[00:36:33] <MootPoot> you need to get familiar before you go chase after anything specific - finish a beginner course on udemy, then go find a specific video on YT 
[00:36:38] <JesseDesu> cuz all i want to do is make 3d printable anime girls of characters that dont have their own pvc figures yet
[00:36:48] <JesseDesu> and make garage kits
[00:39:12] <JesseDesu> the problem is that the content i need has to be extracted from one of these 46 hour classes

[02:50:17] <ButterNoodle> yea
[02:50:34] <emmeka> :(
[02:51:04] <ButterNoodle> sorry.. its just cgdct with fish and stuff
[02:51:12] <ButterNoodle> and they arent really doing cute things
[02:51:20] <emmeka> I'm liking it. It's got enough yuri to keep me going, and some feels.
[02:51:25] <ButterNoodle> doing work..
[02:51:35] <emmeka> plus a 3,3timeskip from high school to adult life
[02:51:54] <ButterNoodle> yea if there was about 5% more yuri.. it would rank in seasonal trash instead of dogshit..
[02:52:22] <emmeka> it's going somewhere with it
[02:52:23] <ButterNoodle> yea if that thing u mentioned went the other direction..
[02:52:41] <emmeka> at some point Kai's gonna make a move or something and then she either goes breeder or goes yuri
[02:52:50] <ButterNoodle> many good anime were ruined 1,1 by timeskipping forward 
[02:53:04] <emmeka> if she goes breeder, the show will be ruined
[02:53:11] <ButterNoodle> bet
[02:53:13] <ButterNoodle> ruined
[02:53:29] <Roey> ButterNoodle: hey that's like how they tried to do damage control with season 3 of Star Trek: Discovery
[02:53:31] <ButterNoodle> I mean its beautifully animated..
[02:53:43] <ButterNoodle> Roey: not a trek'ey
[02:54:07] <emmeka> ButterNoodle I also liked that like, it didn't work out for them. The whole show was set up like 3,3they were going to work hard and save the aquarium. But in the end, they fail, and time goes on.
[02:54:08] <Roey> ah
[02:54:21] <ButterNoodle> I watches a few of the movies.. thats about it
[02:54:22] <Jigsy> My room is cold...
[02:54:29] <ButterNoodle> my dad was the trekie
[02:54:50] <ButterNoodle> emmeka: yea its just bad writing
[02:54:52] <emmeka> it's a show about life not working out like you think it will when you're young and full of dreams and hope, and how you keep going anyway
[02:54:59] <Aurora_v_kosmose> uwu
[02:55:00] <emmeka> I think that's pretty great
[02:55:04] <ButterNoodle> unless 1,1 they reopen it as adults
[02:56:24] <emmeka> ButterNoodle I also can't really tell what the show's endgame now, and that's a good thing
[02:56:35] <ButterNoodle> tru
[02:56:42] <Cryowolf> greetings
[02:56:47] <ButterNoodle> even if its dogshit.. I always finish
[02:57:05] <ButterNoodle> ButterNoodle always finished
[02:57:28] <Cryowolf> I didnt have to g into the ER afterall, I conacted my sarcoma emergency number and they said I should wait it through and unless it gets worse or I start to feel sick elsewhere, there's no need to go in
[02:58:00] <ButterNoodle> what happened Cryowolf
[02:58:21] <Cryowolf> vaccine reaction
[02:58:22] <emmeka> the only thing they could do to ruin the show for me is make Kai and Kukuru get together. If they ruin this perfectly good yuri with some hetero crap I'll be mad
[02:58:30] <Cryowolf> 39-40 C fever
[02:58:38] <ButterNoodle> ic
[02:58:38] <Cryowolf> topped at 40.2 or something
[02:58:43] <ButterNoodle> fuck that
[02:58:49] <Cryowolf> now it's down to 38.8
[02:59:00] <Cryowolf> so its slowly recovering
[03:00:21] <Cryowolf> but the pfizer vaccine gave me some serious fever
[03:00:32] <Cryowolf> hopefully now it's only going down and not up again
[03:03:12] <ButterNoodle> hope everything is ok
[03:03:17] <ButterNoodle> emmeka: this episode..
[03:03:38] <Cryowolf> ButterNoodle, about the vaccine it should be, I mean its down below 39 so
[03:04:35] <Cryowolf> 38.5 38.6 now ;D

[08:11:31] <xdbear> amigojapan: by loli i mean little girls being lewded
[08:12:04] <amigojapan> xdbear: but that is lot what loli means
[08:12:29] <ButterNoodle> its ok amigojapan.. he's one of them
[08:12:51] <xdbear> amigojapan: it means lolita and younger girls, i know, but commonly "loli" refers to sexualized little girls
[08:12:55] <amigojapan> xdbear: sounds like you are talking of some specific ero anime
[08:13:15] <xdbear> any ero anime with little girls yeah
[08:13:19] <xdbear> grody 
[08:13:39] <amigojapan> Yeah xdbear I don't watch ero anime either

[08:15:57] <xdbear> i have a bear head band i use when im washing my face
[08:16:02] <amigojapan> xdbear: so as long as there is no lewding, it's ok right? Cause non non biyori or girls last tour have "loli" characters but they are not sexualised at all
[08:16:16] <ButterNoodle> is a common cosplay
[08:16:24] <Urchin[emacs]> bear pajamas never got explained
[08:16:47] <xdbear> amigojapan: yeah idc about that, precure is popular in japan rn and the girls arent sexualized so whatever

[08:25:53] <Aurora_v_kosmose> xdbear: That sounds awfully expensive
[08:25:56] <ButterNoodle> ik ur getting lots of walking in amigojapan... keep it up bc keto will eat muscle when ur body is starving

[08:26:31] <amigojapan> Alright ButterNoodle 
[08:26:39] <xdbear> one elk will last a winter so its worth it
[08:27:37] <Aurora_v_kosmose> xdbear: You learned butchering or you pay for that?
[08:27:49] <amigojapan> xdbear: I have had my share of udon, since I have lived 19 years in Japan
[08:28:37] <xdbear> aurora: my family hunts and they do it. i'm a wimp.
[08:28:45] <ButterNoodle> Aurora_v_kosmose: I like those guide trips where they process and ship it back to ur house frozen.. too old to be bothered with it
[08:29:19] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: I don't know about butchering, but my grandfather took me on a fishing boat and we paid for the cutting up the fish with the fish we caught
[08:29:23] <xdbear> amigojapan: give 
[08:30:01] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Fish tend to be less messy. Mostly because they're much smaller than an elk.
[08:30:10] <amigojapan> xdbear: give what?
[08:30:31] <amigojapan> Ah right Aurora_v_kosmose 
[08:30:34] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I suppose if you fished some large thing like a tuna it would also be a hassle.
[08:30:35] <xdbear> amigojapan: udon
[08:30:54] <amigojapan> xdbear: ah
[08:30:57] <ButterNoodle> Aurora_v_kosmose: worth it for hamachi
[08:31:13] <ButterNoodle> thats a decent sized fish.. some of those tuna are monsters tho
[08:32:39] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: better sell your tuna in Japan, they go for several thousand dollars
[08:33:15] <Aurora_v_kosmose> amigojapan: Expensive, huh.

[08:44:23] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Part of the reason I haven't is that some of my devices are laptops. And good USB3+ NICs are expensive... and so few people buy them that they're expensive and only available new.

[08:50:26] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That's usually SFP or SFP+
[08:50:41] <MootPoot> yes, but the problem is the price of the NICs right?
[08:50:52] <MootPoot> multi port gigabit nics are cheap

[11:19:46] <ImoutoBot> amigojapan: gennji was last seen in #anime 4 months and 28 days ago: <Gennji> can you get there on foot?
[11:20:23] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: those 3 and Emmanuel_Chanel are the 4 Japanese users we ever had
[11:22:01] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: ok
[11:22:54] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: we lost gennji when we switched from freenode here
[11:23:29] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: hmm, its weird how quite a few users were lost in the transition
[11:23:44] <DunceCotus> like when you move house there's always something that gets lost in the move
[11:26:26] <DunceCotus> when I first moved out of my parent's house I lost my copy of Zelda: Wind Waker
[11:26:51] <DunceCotus> what's weird is there's no possible way it could have gotten lost
[11:27:13] <DunceCotus> its like moving has an ontological characteristic.. its more than just physically moving 
[11:27:24] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I lost my picture albums. Now I have only a couple of pictures of my parents and grandparents :(
[11:27:49] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: sorry to hear :(
[11:28:09] <DunceCotus> when we move its like reality shifts
[11:28:33] <DunceCotus> to relocate is to relocate not simply in spacetime but metaphysically

[11:34:59] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: I believe there may be multiple realities that we shift into, and sometimes we shift depending on location
[11:35:18] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I have relocated to 3 different countries
[11:35:34] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: did you notice any fundamental differences?
[11:35:55] <DunceCotus> differences that cannot be explained by a physical relocation?
[11:36:10] <amigojapan> Well Japan is a very different place, but I expected that
[11:36:22] <amigojapan> Nah DunceCotus 
[11:37:13] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: I see
[11:38:52] <DunceCotus> how these realities cross-communicate I cannot say, but I think they do (to some extent)
[11:39:45] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I have not tasted it, but they say the toilet water spins in the opposite direction in Japan from the US

[13:19:12] <saganman> woah, I don't do anything on bed, honestly
[13:19:43] <Matt|home> you asexual or something? seriously that's a level of self conciousness i haven't heard in a while
[13:19:51] <saganman> I hardly have any action in my life Matt|home 
[13:20:07] <Matt|home> i feel bad for you :\ people like you care too much about what others think, and im gonna tell you right here and now
[13:20:08] <Matt|home> FUCK people
[13:20:17] <darkwitch> I assume you do something in bed, like sleep
[13:20:30] <Matt|home> shit i have my own personal jack off chair
[13:20:48] <Matt|home> i tell people not to sit in it because it's mine
[13:20:50] <Matt|home> and they do it anyway
[13:20:56] <saganman> yes, people suck but the people I invite over are my friends
[13:21:19] <Matt|home> are your friends your longtime lovers companions confidants and those you'd trust with your life?

[13:22:33] <darkwitch> totally bff
[13:22:53] <saganman> well, I don't try to think in terms like that
[13:23:03] <amigojapan> I am going to 711
[13:23:15] <Matt|home> i am so goddamn hungry.. it's not even 6 am yet though..
[13:23:16] <saganman> when you don't expect anything from anyone, life is much easier
[13:23:29] <Matt|home> that's the correct attitude saganman , do shit yourself
[13:23:35] <saganman> yeah
[13:23:37] <Matt|home> i still say it's fine for you to jack it in bed :\
[13:23:52] <saganman> and do shit for others without expecting anything in return
[13:24:10] <Matt|home> but whatever floats your boat. sigh.. i really don't want convenience store food right now.. and if i go when the supermarket opens they won't have anything i can immediately eat without cooking
[13:24:33] <saganman> nah, jacking off on chair is better in front of pc is better
[13:25:00] <Matt|home> .. what did you eat today?
[13:25:38] <saganman> some kind of roti/naan
[13:26:03] <Matt|home> enh.. nah.. maybe.. pasta later i guess.. but for breakfast i have no idea
[13:26:20] <saganman> what do you have?
[13:26:43] <saganman> BLT?
[13:26:51] <saganman> PBJ?
[13:27:11] <Matt|home> to cook? nothing, i have a chronic mold issue with my water pipes and sink that needs to be addressed. it's either prepared shit or something like a sandwhich i don't need to use silverware or plates to make
[13:28:01] <saganman> sandwich is good
[13:28:04] <Matt|home> i really should get that fixed by monday..
[13:28:23] <Matt|home> expensive.. average price is 7-10 USD here for a decent not shit one
[13:28:44] <Matt|home> i can buy cold cuts and bread and make it myself, but that just halves the price really
[13:29:09] <saganman> mix mayonnaise and mustard together and spread it on butter toast with onions and tomatoes 
[13:29:24] <Matt|home> that sounds good except nix the onions and tomatos :p
[13:29:47] <Matt|home> im a man of simple tastes. bread, meat, cheese, mustard, salt and pepper
[13:29:50] <Matt|home> default sandwich
[13:30:12] <saganman> mix mustard and mayo, it's really good
[13:30:56] <Matt|home> it was so weird saganman .. i vacation in australia for christmas with family usually, and the first time i did they apparently didn't have yellow mustard, it was like a rarity
[13:31:01] <Matt|home> they had other weird mustard

[14:37:43] <emmeka> the current variety of banana grown nearly worldwide is the cavendish banana. the banana common before that was the Gros Michel, but then a new fungal disease spread which wiped out that variety.

[14:41:15] <emmeka> amigojapan another food thing that tasted different for prior generations: rootbeer.
[14:41:30] <emmeka> rootbeer is so named because it was made from the root of the sassafras tree
[14:41:54] <emmeka> but, in the 50s they discovered that the essential oil of the tree, safrole, is carcinogenic.
[14:42:26] <emmeka> since then it's been banned for food usage, so all "root beer" is imitation root beer simulating the original flavour

[21:23:32] <Bco1981> Berlin36: 17.3 if you do not plan on moving it much. (always AC plugged in)
[21:23:45] <Berlin36> and also bigger the screen, the faster it should discharge
[21:23:52] <Berlin36> i see Bco1981
[21:23:56] <Bco1981> or need the screen space... or... if your eyes are going bad.
[21:24:28] <Berlin36> i think i'll look more at 14"
[21:24:53] <Berlin36> because battery consumption is lower and i guess it'll be much easier to carry with you

[21:29:31] <Berlin36> yeah
[21:29:53] <MootPoot> Bco1981: presumably it would show up as all the different partitions right when you plug it in
[21:29:54] <Bco1981> it's not like i ca make a good old dos boot menu in the config.sys

[21:31:40] <Berlin36> oh
[21:31:47] <Bco1981> With ventoy, you don't need to format the disk over and over, you just need to copy the ISO/WIM/IMG/VHD(x)/EFI files to the USB drive and boot them directly.

[23:31:18] <MootPoot> all usb is cross compatible
[23:31:33] <MootPoot> as long as you have the right adapter for usb c to A
[23:31:33] <Bco1981> but that's thunderbolt
[23:31:44] <MootPoot> thunderbolt works with usb c 
[23:31:51] <Bco1981> adaptor...
[23:31:54] <Bco1981> no
[23:32:11] <MootPoot> but thunderbolt and usb 3,2 2x2 is usb c only
[23:32:16] <MootPoot> same with usb 4
[23:32:44] <Bco1981> some pc's i come across, don't have more then usb2.0... usb-c woul need an adaptor... not an option
[23:33:12] <MootPoot> if you want no adapter then really your only solution is usb type a at usb 3/3.1/3.2
[23:33:19] <Roey> <MootPoot> Roey: unless you are talking about usb 3.2 gen 2x2  <- the latest one available until usb 4.0 becomes a thing in the market, yeah
[23:33:25] <Bco1981> exactly
[23:33:29] <Roey> 18<26MootPoot18> a thunderbolt drive should work with simple usb as well <- aye, very true
[23:33:44] <MootPoot> Roey: I will wife you
[23:33:49] <Roey> \o/
[23:33:58] <Roey> am so happy to hear that!!
[23:34:46] <MootPoot> but anyway
[23:34:52] <MootPoot> Bco1981: what are you, free tech support?
[23:35:06] <Bco1981> if this ventoy works, i might be able to only need 4 usbkeys for my windows stuff
[23:35:09] <Bco1981> MootPoot: yues

[23:35:20] <Cryowolf> hello
[23:36:27] <Bco1981> when i help a person, that's one more person that will use their computer even more. and make better use of it. also giving them hints to better use, while not being too overwhelming.
[23:36:31] <Bco1981> Cryowolf: hi
[23:37:13] <MootPoot> but then they call you 3 months later and are like
[23:37:25] <Cryowolf> Bco1981, is it also another person you can introduce a backdoor to use their harddrives to store things in a secret partition?
[23:37:28] <MootPoot> "hey Bco1981 I spilled water on my keyboard and it dosen't work anymore, this is your fault"
[23:37:30] <Bco1981> if you do your job right... it will be years
[23:38:04] <Bco1981> MootPoot: no... that's you being stupid for having liquid near electronics
[23:38:18] <MootPoot> hey
[23:38:31] <MootPoot> its not me who blames the last person who touches my PC
[23:38:39] <MootPoot> but a lot of people do with things they dont understad
[23:38:51] <MootPoot> although I do have liquid at my desk
[23:38:52] <MootPoot> lol
