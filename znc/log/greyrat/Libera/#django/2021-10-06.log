[00:44:26] <pycode1> i basically have this modal for login
[00:44:45] <pycode1> i include this modal everywhere
[00:44:57] <pycode1> so i must add the form somehow
[00:45:25] <pycode1> and then do: {% include "template/login.html"  with user_form=user_form %}
[00:45:36] <pycode1> something like that
[00:48:57] <GinF> You want a context processor. Any view can handle ajax, it's not really different from handling normal request until the point where you return a response, e.g. you may want to use JsonResponse
[00:49:04] *** GinF is now known as GinFuyou
[00:49:48] <pycode1> GinFuyou, i need html
[00:49:55] <pycode1> i mean i just found that bootstrap
[00:50:03] <pycode1> can open a modal loading content via ajax
[00:50:22] <pycode1> so i can create a view that reply to this call
[00:50:29] <pycode1> https://www.abidibo.net/blog/2015/11/18/modal-django-forms-bootstrap-4/
[00:50:39] <pycode1> a bit old but it still makes sense
[00:51:06] <GinFuyou> You probably don't want a complete html anyway
[00:51:20] <GinFuyou> Since main template already has it
[00:51:38] <pycode1> GinFuyou, why? i think is more..easy no? i can create an html with the form and there i can put all the validation errors etc..
[00:51:39] <pycode1> no no
[00:51:42] <pycode1> not a complete html
[00:51:45] <pycode1> just the html of the form
[00:51:52] <pycode1> i will not extends the base.html
[00:52:21] <GinFuyou> Yes, rendering errors could be probably easier
[00:53:21] <pycode1> this LoginView will have a partial, just the html of the form, that way i can use the Auth view without dealing with jsonresponse or something like that
[00:53:32] <GinFuyou> but plan is the same, you handle view as usual, just return a specialized response, be it partial html, xml, json or whatever your JS can handle
[00:54:56] *** Joins: djapo (~archangel@user/djapo)
[00:57:03] <pycode1> GinFuyou, yes but there is a problem (if i do not use this "solution") if i put the code of the form modal in every template (or better...in the main layout) then i cannot create the form with the real "form" object, i can do that right but i should put the form object on EVERY get_context_data of all the view i need to then {% include "login.html" form_user=form_user %}
[00:57:50] <pycode1> a bit awkward
[00:57:56] <GinFuyou> For that part I suggested context processor
[00:59:03] <GinFuyou> another option would be a login button that opens a modal, that loads a rendered form html on demand
[00:59:20] <pycode1> GinFuyou, yeah exactly what i mean (last thing you said)
[00:59:28] <pycode1> https://www.abidibo.net/blog/2015/11/18/modal-django-forms-bootstrap-4/

[03:54:00] <shangxiao> I was going to reply about GeoDjango but they left *shrug*
[03:55:15] <vecchp> Is there any way to override the save() method on a model such that it calls LAST_INSERT_ID() to get the last automatically created primary key?  I do not believe I am able to use AutoField because it isn't an automatically incremented id.
[03:55:58] <zircona> I get those using the location using navigator.geolocation
[03:56:08] <vecchp> This is for a MySQL connection.
[03:58:15] <PaulWay[w]> vecchp: have you tested that assumption there?
[03:58:46] <PaulWay[w]> I use Postgres but it seems able to cope with inserting new data with higher IDs than the current sequence ID and then adding more data after that...
[04:00:48] *** Quits: rje (~rje@50.35.241.164) (Quit: My computer has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[04:00:54] <vecchp> @PaulWay[w], the connection I have is the CDATA ODBC Sql Gateway.  It exposes an odbc connection as a MySql or Sql Server DB.  So it is essentially wrapping a rest API with SQL.  The id generated is not automatically incremented and is generated based on some rules of the remote api.
[04:01:52] <PaulWay[w]> Well that really sounds like a model that Django is not managing.
[04:02:05] <vecchp> it isn't a managed model by django.
[04:02:29] <vecchp> but i'm trying to call LAST_INSERT_ID() correctly during the save method.
[04:02:55] *** Quits: django-ticketbot (~django-ti@django/ops/ticketbot) (Remote host closed the connection)
[04:03:10] <PaulWay[w]> So you've marked it as managed=False in the Meta class?

[04:04:04] <PaulWay[w]> What does it normally return?
[04:04:07] <FunkyBob> oh, mysql still doesn't support that

[04:07:57] <vecchp> @PaulWay[w], well I don't mind using another method of getting this.  But I need to call LAST_INSERT_ID() with the insert call.  I can't do it within a transaction since it seems like the wrapper doesn't respect them.
[04:08:28] <PaulWay[w]> You're trying to find out the ID after the save() call yes?
[04:08:39] *** Quits: stats4647 (~stats4647@ip174-67-220-13.oc.oc.cox.net) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[04:09:05] <FunkyBob> doesn't django already manage that?
[04:09:12] <FunkyBob> transparently ,because mysql is broken about it?
[04:09:20] <vecchp> @PaulWay[w], I do want to ID after save
[04:09:34] <PaulWay[w]> Then do obj.save() then new_id = obj.id
[04:09:54] <vecchp> @PaulWay[w], the id is none at that moment which is the problem
[04:10:03] <vecchp> (even after save)
[04:10:09] <PaulWay[w]> Then you may need to refresh it from db.
[04:10:21] <PaulWay[w]> Can't remember the method OTTOMH.
[04:10:23] <vecchp> how is it capable of refreshing from db without a pk?
[04:10:37] <PaulWay[w]> Try it and find out.
[04:10:47] <vecchp> @PaulWay[w], I have already gone down that route
[04:11:11] <vecchp> it isn't capable of doing it because it needs a row id
[04:11:31] <PaulWay[w]> I mean, treating a REST API as an ODBC connection and then calling that a MySQL or SQL Server interface is already pretty special.
[04:11:48] <vecchp> i understand that but hey that is where I am
[04:11:49] <PaulWay[w]> This sounds like the portent of more problems to come.
[04:12:03] <PaulWay[w]> Find a better way to interact with that API.
[04:12:06] <FunkyBob> https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/models/instances/#auto-incrementing-primary-keys
[04:12:20] <PaulWay[w]> Like, say, talking to it as a REST API.
[04:12:22] <FunkyBob> "If a model has an AutoField — an auto-incrementing primary key — then that auto-incremented value will be calculated and saved as an attribute on your object the first time you call save():
[04:12:26] <FunkyBob> "
[04:12:43] <vecchp> @PaulWay[w], not really an option to "do something else".
[04:12:45] <PaulWay[w]> Except that this is a very weird and special not-quite-database FunkyBob.
[04:13:05] <FunkyBob> PaulWay[w]: oh, right, ODBC in  the way
[04:13:19] <FunkyBob> oh, no.. wait...
[04:13:22] <FunkyBob> wrapping a REST api in SQL?
[04:13:23] <PaulWay[w]> Yes.
[04:13:24] <FunkyBob> yikes
[04:13:44] <PaulWay[w]> Use requests to talk HTTP to it.
[04:13:54] <vecchp> CData is a pretty well known company for doing stuff like this.  They seem to be making a pretty decent living off of it.
[04:14:07] <PaulWay[w]> So what.
[04:14:39] <vecchp> well thinks for the help.  Looks like i've hit my limit here.
[04:14:44] <FunkyBob> it just seems to be burning your defvelopment budget, vecchp
[04:16:13] <wallbroken> what does "yikes" mean?
[04:16:16] <PaulWay[w]> Well, tell CData that their ODBC connector doesn't work.
[04:16:30] <PaulWay[w]> It's an expression of alarm.

[12:15:09] <pycode1> guys when you load an html with an ajax call, if this html has some jquery inside do i must add:   $(document).ready(function () { $("#myform").submit(function(e){}); });
[12:15:12] <pycode1> or just $("#myform").submit(function(e){}); ?
[12:15:25] <pycode1> the last one is working...but i have some doubt about that
[12:15:55] <pycode1> if i call the html as a normal request i obviously get $ not defined
[12:16:13] <pycode1> but if i inject an html inside a dom, how should i do?
[12:16:24] <pycode1> inside document ready? or just use $ ?
[12:24:28] <FunkyBob> back up a sec, pycode1
[12:24:39] <FunkyBob> so you're loading a html fragment via an ajax request?
[12:25:11] <FunkyBob> or your'e trying to work out how to load it?
[12:25:45] <pycode1> FunkyBob, i am working on login (we chat about that yesterday) so i have a LoginView that has the template_name = 'theme/partial/fomr_login.html'
[12:25:54] <pycode1> this form_login.html has just the form nothing else
[12:25:59] <pycode1> then i load that html inside my modal
[12:26:08] <pycode1> "the problem" is that i need to intercept the submit
[12:26:16] <pycode1> when the modal is loaded and then the user try to login
[12:26:20] <pycode1> i need to intercept the submit
[12:26:27] <shangxiao> what?
[12:26:28] <pycode1> and send the request via ajax instead of "normal" post
[12:26:38] <pycode1> shangxiao, ?
[12:27:01] <FunkyBob> so, add an submit listener to cancel the submit, and to post the AJAX request
[12:27:13] <shangxiao> there was a handy jquery plugin that did exactly this
[12:27:19] <pycode1> https://bpa.st/U5WA
[12:27:53] <pycode1> as you see there is the html of the form below that i need a piece of js
[12:27:53] <shangxiao> but more recently… turbolinks also does this
[12:27:55] <pycode1> that handle the submit
[12:28:00] <FunkyBob> i'm just stunned anyone still uses jquery :P
[12:28:14] <pycode1> FunkyBob, i am trying to rewrite everything in vanilla js
[12:28:20] <shangxiao> well last time I used that plugin was back in 2014
[12:28:32] <pycode1> i do not want to use jquery
[12:28:36] <FunkyBob> pycode1: ah, well, if you'd opened with that I would have more to say :)
[12:28:40] <pycode1> but bootstrap has some dependencies inside
[12:28:47] <FunkyBob> bootstrap 5 dropped jquery
[12:29:00] <pycode1> ok i can try to use bootstrap 5
[12:29:19] <pycode1> FunkyBob, just to show i am opening the modal via ajax
[12:29:23] <pycode1> i need to replace that code too
[12:29:34] <pycode1> i have to check if my code is bootstrap 5 compatible
[12:29:39] <FunkyBob> but you're not
[12:29:39] <pycode1> now i am using bootstrap 4.4.1
[12:29:45] <FunkyBob> you're opening the model after an ajax request
[12:29:45] <pycode1> FunkyBob, ?
[12:29:49] <FunkyBob> that's not "via ajax"
[12:29:54] <FunkyBob> you're requesting its content via ajax
[12:30:01] <pycode1> yes i need to open when the content is reading
[12:30:02] <pycode1> yes exactly
[12:30:13] <pycode1> thats what we talked yesterday no?
[12:30:39] <FunkyBob> no?
[12:31:16] <pycode1> oh pardon
[12:31:20] <pycode1> GinFuyou <
[12:31:21] <pycode1> eheh
[12:31:32] <pycode1> i basically need to show the login form in a modal
[12:31:43] <pycode1> so i am loading that form with an ajax call
[12:31:46] <pycode1> and put the html inside the modal
[12:31:50] <pycode1> then i need to deal with submit
[12:32:37] <FunkyBob> after adding the new content to the dOM, you need to find its <form> element and add an event listener to its submit event
[12:33:07] <FunkyBob> document.querySelector('#loginModal form').addEventListener('submit', ev => {...});
[12:33:17] <FunkyBob> in the ... you need to cancel the submit, and perform your own work
[12:33:48] <pycode1> FunkyBob, ok but one more question, should i put that js code inside the content i am loading via ajax or...for example in a main.js i call it globally in the layout ?
[12:33:56] <pycode1> how do you usually do ?
[12:34:37] <FunkyBob> no
[12:34:45] <FunkyBob> not inside the fragment
[12:35:09] <FunkyBob> though, for cleanly  and _safely_ handling dynamically injected content, schinckel has more experience

[12:35:30] <pycode1> ok i wait him
[12:38:54] <pycode1> FunkyBob, i have some problem with bootstrap 5 i need to decide if i must fix them or try to avoid using jquery with bootstrap 4.4 but it seems integrated
[12:41:06] <pycode1> for example i noticed that the theme uses owl.carousel.min.js OWL requires jquery

[13:48:04] <pycode> serafeim, do you prefer jquery?
[13:48:20] <pycode> hmmm because maybe i just need simple js
[13:48:21] <shangxiao> but what i don't understand is why you're going out of your way to avoid some code because it has jquery in it
[13:48:29] <pycode> so jquery is overhead
[13:48:45] <serafeim> yes i always include it in my projects https://github.com/spapas/cookiecutter-django-starter/blob/master/%7B%7Bcookiecutter.project_name%7D%7D/templates/theme_base.html#L48
[13:48:51] <shangxiao> what are you running on a micro device?
[13:49:12] <pycode> shangxiao, no i think that if i can do that in vanilla js i should use it without loading additional libraries

[13:49:23] <serafeim> pycode: ok but it aint' really overhead. it's like 90 kb smaller than most images
[13:49:48] <shangxiao> wasn't jquery-lite also a thing?
[13:49:59] <pycode> lite? hmm let me check never used
[13:49:59] <serafeim> yes i think it doesn't include the ajax functionality
[13:50:29] <serafeim> but i prefer the jquery ajax instead of using fetch or (god forbid) the XMLHttpRequest thingie
[13:50:55] <serafeim> i remember like 10 years ago i couldn't use jquery in a project and i could only use XMLHttpRequest... doign an ajax request was such a PITA

[13:53:41] <serafeim> fetch wants you to use promises and other complex things which i'd rather avoid if i don't need it
[13:53:59] <pycode> serafeim, ok but there is a particular reason for that? because i can understand if you have to write 20 lines of code to make an ajax call, ok, but in this case fetch() seems really...concise to me :D

[13:54:18] <shangxiao> i think you'll find that people *always* write some level of abstraction over the top of fetch() anyway… there's always cors or something else to configure
[13:54:39] <pycode> i think $.ajax is a promise too
[13:55:05] <serafeim> pycode: no $.ajax uses callbacks. it can be converted to a promise of course

[15:02:08] <tamere> Hello guys ! 👋
[15:03:29] <tamere> Is it possible to return a response from memcache and in the background, make a task that will invalidate the cache?
[15:03:51] <tamere> I saw and I've already use ThreadPool but I don't think it will help me on this task

[15:17:33] <dodo> tamere: erm, use any task queue?
[15:18:06] <dodo> tamere: why does it have to be in the background though, is clearing the cache not fast?
[15:18:17] <dodo> or what does invalidate mean to you?
[15:19:21] <tamere> I have a heavy process that I want to cache the result
[15:19:40] <dodo> but you asked about making the cache invalid?
[15:20:10] <tamere> I know django-q but it's maybe a bit overkill for this task
[15:20:14] <tamere> I will try django-crontab
[15:20:21] <dodo> hm
[15:20:28] <tamere> To invalidate the cache each X minutes
[15:20:38] <dodo> that doesn't sound ideal
[15:20:49] <dodo> especially if building the cache takes time?
[15:21:11] *** Joins: DnzAtWrk (~DnzAtWrk@mobile-access-6df0bc-198.dhcp.inet.fi)
[15:21:14] <tamere> The cache takes 30 seconds to build itself
[15:21:38] <dodo> so, yeah, build that, and then update the cache?
[15:22:49] <tamere> Yeah in the crontab I will update the cache
[15:23:11] <tamere> And in the rest endpoint I will return the result from the cache if the result is in the cache

[17:38:20] <timdiels> Hi, why does the group=... query add a GROUP BY id? I fixed it by adding .values(*keys) before .annotate but there's no reason to use group by at all. The code https://dpaste.org/vXeg and the SQL https://dpaste.org/aTCz
[17:38:50] <Wooble> I'd say the largest screen reasonable is probably a bigger factor for (especially web) dev than any other specs. But then I'm spoiled using 2-monitor desktop setups...
[17:39:22] <pycode> Wooble, 17'' ?
[17:39:30] <timdiels> The id is the tie breaker in the example btw
[17:39:51] <timdiels> so maybe it gets confused by the .values() after the .annotate()?
[17:40:03] <pycode> i found this one https://www.amazon.it/HP-15s-fq2004sl-Notebook-i5-1135G7-Grafica/dp/B091J242GX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8&th=1
[17:40:06] <pycode> tamere,

[17:41:07] <pycode> and i still thinking to buy another one
[17:41:20] <pycode> but i need a large table too
[17:42:28] <Wooble> if you're mostly able to work with external monitors attached the size matters a lot less... not being able to reasonably have an editor and browser side by side always makes me feel claustophobic :)

[22:30:08] <Diplomat> Hey guys! I'm trying to figure out how I can use relative paths in my templates like {% static "./files/style.css" %}. I want it to get the style.css from files folder that's inside my template's folder. The path for the template is set in the URL.
[22:30:52] <GinFuyou> You are not supposed to have static in templates folder
[22:32:03] <Diplomat> https://dpaste.org/JAfp here's how it looks and how I'd like to use it
[22:33:23] <GinFuyou> You are not supposed to make templates public in the first place as rest of the code. That's why media and static are separated and have own settings for them
[22:33:43] <Diplomat> Yes, I'm aware of this, but I'm not using Django traditionally here
[22:34:44] <GinFuyou> well, don't use static tag then? I'm really not sure about what is your case and if it should be used
[22:36:09] <Diplomat> That's a tricky one then.. because then I'll need to write tons of crazy stuff because the View class is trying to respond to the style.css URL
[22:37:02] <GinFuyou> That's what I'm getting too... though I believe many things can be achieved. Question if it should be

[22:41:40] <GinFuyou> Why does it have to use relative static paths?
[22:42:05] <Diplomat> It doesn't have to do that.. but that was my only idea how I could achieve it without writing out the full path
[22:42:52] <GinFuyou> Well, depends on details how those landing pages are created
[22:43:17] <Diplomat> They are just simple html pages.. nothing fancy and I don't want to edit urls file all the time or restart gunicorn or something

I wrote a middleware that is simply like this (https://dpaste.org/ef1P), and put it right under `LocaleMiddlewar
[22:53:19] <majdal> gs.py/. But the website still loads in English every time I load the page, even when I clear the cookies, etc..   
[22:53:20] <majdal> Any idea what could be going on?
[22:55:37] <GinFuyou> Diplomat, yes, rework it a traditional django approach - media files registered through db
[22:57:19] <Diplomat> But that's the problem. I'd have to set up new URLs and stuff and people who work with those pages can't do that.
[22:57:46] <GinFuyou> No, exactly this solves that problem
[22:58:09] <GinFuyou> You are over-engineering it as far as I see

[23:00:35] <Diplomat> Nah, using media works just fine.. I don't need template support, it's not a requirement. It would be nice tho, but that's about it. Having people modifying django stuff would mean everything would be down lol
[23:01:24] <GinFuyou> That's why you use user-created media that is trivial and doesn't have any issues
