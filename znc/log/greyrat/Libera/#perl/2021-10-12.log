[00:02:04] <aquanight> roles
[00:02:19] <aquanight> LeoNerd: did I already ask you what the destruct order is WRT roles?
[00:02:25] <LeoNerd> You didn't
[00:02:33] <LeoNerd> I don't do anything with destruction so that's just whatever perl does
[00:02:50] <aquanight> what about DESTROY methods?
[00:02:59] <aquanight> or is it just treated as a simple virtual method?
[00:03:02] <LeoNerd> Again, I don't do anything with them ye
[00:03:04] <LeoNerd> +t
[00:03:38] <aquanight> so, classes that override DESTROY are responsible for calling base/role DESTROY
[00:03:48] <aquanight> (and of course, role DESTROY is probably not callable)
[00:04:01] <LeoNerd> Indeed, currently
[00:04:14] <LeoNerd> I'll address it at some point if/when I ever actually run into a real usecase

[00:06:46] <aquanight> that just leaves the question of what the order *should* be (and pray to all the gods we can exercise SOME kind of sanity during global destruction)
[00:06:55] * GumbyPAN CPAN Upload: App-Netdisco-2.049010 by OLIVER https://metacpan.org/release/OLIVER/App-Netdisco-2.049010
[00:07:03] <aquanight> the obvious answer is "reverse of construct order"
[00:07:24] <aquanight> much like I believe END {} blocks are... last-to-first?
[00:08:01] <LeoNerd> The order should be the exact reverse of ADJUST
[00:08:23] <aquanight> right
[00:08:32] <aquanight> lexically but also WRT derived -> base -> roles
[00:08:41] <LeoNerd> Indeed
[00:08:46] <LeoNerd> That's still lexical, if squint at it
[00:09:02] <LeoNerd> class D isa A does B, C { ... }    <== will ADJUST in A, then B, then C, then D
[00:09:04] <aquanight> even if I think that if you're banking on destruct order *between* classes, you're doing unsafe method calls during object life events
[00:09:06] *** Quits: rundown (~eb0t@90.208.41.2) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[00:09:36] <LeoNerd> If you apply the same role multiple times, er... ... yeah don't ;)
[00:09:49] <aquanight> ... can that actually happen?
[00:10:12] <LeoNerd> class A does R {}  class B isa A does R {}
[00:10:13] <aquanight> like class A does R { } class B isa A does R { } # what happens
[00:10:31] <LeoNerd> Currently, the second one just silently does nothing, because it's already there
[00:10:32] <aquanight> I'd think the second 'does' would do nothing because it's already composed R via A
[00:10:38] <LeoNerd> Roles application is presumed to be idempotent
[00:10:49] <aquanight> I see nothing wrong with such presumption
[00:10:59] <LeoNerd> Parametric roles might break that
[00:11:13] <LeoNerd> but we don't have those. also I dislike the name "parametric role" but I don't have a better one yet.
[00:11:20] <aquanight> role template?
[00:11:28] <LeoNerd> I don't want to call it a "template role" because ohboy I'd never hear the end of it from the C++ fans
[00:11:35] <aquanight> lol
[00:11:39] <aquanight> generic role?
[00:11:48] <aquanight> those are the only other names for the concept I know of
[00:11:48] <LeoNerd> generic is too ... *ahem* generic a word

[00:12:38] <aquanight> perlbot: hard problems
[00:12:39] <perlbot> aquanight: there's only two hard things in computer science: naming things, cache invalidation, and off by one errors
[00:13:04] <LeoNerd> Another fun one I saw the other day: Given off-by-one errors, that implies the existence of the off-by-two error
[00:13:07] <aquanight> I knew it was in there somewhere. Took me a minute.
[00:13:21] <aquanight> LeoNerd: yup.
[00:14:23] <aquanight> LeoNerd: what's funny is, you could continue that chain with induction
[00:14:36] <aquanight> P(1): off-by-one errors exist
[00:15:05] <aquanight> since off-by-one errors exist, off-by-two. Since off-by-two exist, off-by-three. Etc.
[00:15:11] <LeoNerd> Uhhuh
[00:15:15] <aquanight> I'm not sure how many bits are in off-by-X
[00:15:21] <LeoNerd> Off-by-Aleph-null error :)
[00:15:24] <aquanight> but I think eventually we'll get back around to off-by-zero
[00:16:03] <aquanight> nah, aleph-null isn't in our domain. This is computer integers, not mathematical ones. It's a closed, circular domain.
[00:16:14] <LeoNerd> Ah, the One Ring
[00:16:39] <aquanight> the Zeros-and-Ones Ring
[00:18:14] <aquanight> if we've proven that "off-by-zero errors" exist, does this mean all programmed behavior is an error, and thus correct programs don't exist?
[00:18:33] <LeoNerd> Certainly seems like it some days ;)

[00:32:03] <ehuelsmann[m]> zgu: you mean from the end of the list?

[00:33:28] <LeoNerd> Yeah if you have an SLL, even a mutable one, you still have O(n) time to walk to the other end to find what to mutate
[00:34:06] <ehuelsmann[m]> yes. all lists in Lisp (at least Common Lisp) are SLL.

[08:03:00] <boblamont> rindolf: I'm reading the article about Here documents
[08:03:21] <rindolf> ah
[08:04:47] <boblamont> it appears to be more complicated than doing search and replace...
[08:08:04] <rindolf> boblamont: why?
[08:08:50] <boblamont> rindolf: It's an entirely new concept to me
[08:09:52] <rindolf> boblamont: i see.
[08:10:20] <boblamont> rindolf: would I be using it to put in the list of substitutions?
[08:10:30] <rindolf> well, it is easier to maintain in the long run
[08:11:03] <rindolf> boblamont: or just put them in a separate file (e.g "myprog.pl")
[08:12:21] <boblamont> rindolf: ok, I'm sort of getting it. I'm not on familiar ground. I was using pcre regex expressions in my text editor, and was going to use sed, but sed doesn't like lookaheads and lookbehinds
[08:12:45] <boblamont> So I decided I should perhaps use perl
[08:12:51] <rindolf> boblamont: ah
[08:14:18] <rindolf> boblamont: you can do 'perl -p myscript.pl' instead of 'perl -pe...'

[08:20:18] <rindolf> boblamont: great! progress
[08:20:46] <boblamont> rindolf: I have to check my original list and see if that second slash is part of the search and needs to be escaped
[08:21:02] <rindolf> perlbot: lts
[08:21:03] <perlbot> rindolf: Leaning Toothpick Syndrome.  Change your delimiter if you are having to escape all the / in your RE, or use \Q\E (perldoc -f quotemeta) if you need to handle lots of metachars.
[08:21:20] <mst> boblamont: that looks like a typo to me tbh but yeah, double check
[08:22:01] <mst> boblamont: also, rindolf meant using a here document to contain the perl code doing the search and replace
[08:22:09] <mst> boblamont: basic bash trick
[08:24:21] <boblamont> ok, it was in need of an escape, I did that, it seems to work
[08:25:09] <rindolf> boblamont: great
[08:25:29] <boblamont> I know I could change the delimiter, but I was carrying over the escape characters from Bluefish anyway

[14:47:01] <Botje> no.
[14:47:09] <Botje> the '' are just to make your shell not complain.

[17:29:28] <LeoNerd> I do sometimes wish C had a different controlflow keyword for "stop running this loop" vs "stop running this switch block"
[17:29:41] <LeoNerd> It gets awkward trying to stop the loop from inside a switch inside it.. or vice versa
[17:30:32] <ilmari> or block/loop labels
[17:30:47] <LeoNerd> Ohgodyes.. that could easily be added without breaking syntax. They just _still_ haven't yet

[17:34:35] <LeoNerd> It may well be load-time constant, or even link-time.. but it won't be compiletime
[17:34:48] <xenu> in windows it used to be common to explicitly decide at compile time whast base addresses should be used to prevent relocations
[17:34:50] <hethw> hi. I want to see all the function chain that led to the function I'm in, how can I do that?
[17:35:04] <LeoNerd> hethw: perldoc -f caller

[17:35:08] <xenu> s/addresses/address/
[17:35:09] <LeoNerd> but wonder why
[17:35:25] <Altreus> yeah Carp::cluck for "What the fuck is this code doing?"
[17:35:27] <hethw> LeoNerd, that returns only one level up
[17:35:30] <Altreus> caller() for ... reasons
[17:35:39] <mst> hethw: use Carp qw(cluck);
[17:35:47] <mst> hethw: cluck "I AM HERE";
[17:35:48] <LeoNerd> hethw: then you didn't read the docs
[17:35:56] <mst> hethw: that'll live you a full backtrace of the whole thing
[17:36:03] <mst> hethw: no, that's a lie, please listen to me.
[17:36:24] <xenu> caller can return more levels, but yeah, you probably want cluck()
[17:36:27] <mst> hethw: 'croak', as documented, only returns one level up, 'cluck' is a warn equivalent that provides the whole backtrace
[17:36:37] <xenu> or perhaps longmess()
[17:36:51] <xenu> which just prints a backtrace without throwing an exception
[17:36:53] <mst> hethw: caller() returns one level up unless you call it more than once - but cluck does that for you.
[17:37:06] <mst> xenu: cluck is warn+longmess which seems suitable here
[17:37:14] <hethw> I see.
[17:37:32] <hethw> how do I call it more then once? since it's hard to include new modules like Carp
[17:37:35] <xenu> mst: ah, i confused it with confess()
[17:37:39] <xenu> jesus those names are terrible
[17:37:42] <mst> hethw: Carp is part of perl
[17:37:49] <mst> hethw: stop inventing problems that don't exist
[17:38:15] <hethw> ah lovely.
[17:38:19] <hethw> this is a first for me
[17:38:20] <Altreus> xenu: agreed
[17:38:28] <Altreus> xenu: form over function
[17:38:34] <mst> hethw: seriously, try my advice rather than being a dickhead, you'll get working code faster that way.
[17:39:02] <Altreus> IME if you do both that also works
[17:40:49] <xenu> btw if anyone is bored, Carp's documentation needs some love
[17:40:59] <xenu> it literally doesn't document what its functions do
[17:41:12] <xenu> it assumess that you already know what carp/croak/cluck/confess do
[17:41:16] <xenu> assumes*
[17:41:36] <Altreus> oh I thought I was just being stupid
[17:41:45] <Altreus> perlbot: perldoc Carp
[17:41:46] <perlbot> Altreus: Your documentation is available at: https://perldoc.perl.org/Carp
[17:42:11] <Altreus> xenu: the synopsis "tells" you ... whatever "from the perspective of caller" means
[17:42:24] <mst> > The Carp routines are useful in your own modules because they act like die() or warn(), but with a message which is more likely to be useful to a user of your module. In the case of cluck() and confess(), that context is a summary of every call in the call-stack; longmess() returns the contents of the error message.
[17:42:33] <mst> > For a shorter message you can use carp() or croak() which report the error as being from where your module was called. shortmess() returns the contents of this error message. There is no guarantee that that is where the error was, but it is a good educated guess.
[17:42:48] <xenu> ah yes, only synposis actually tells you what they do
[17:42:51] <xenu> that's still sterrible
[17:42:53] <Altreus> oh that caller
[17:42:54] <mst> right at the top of DESCRIPTION
[17:42:55] <revhippie> carp/croak also append the file/line#, wether you end your message with a "\n" or not.
[17:42:59] <mst> tells you exactly what they do
[17:43:08] <xenu> mst: what you quoted doesn't say anything about throwing exceptions or warnings
[17:43:13] <xenu> and which one does what
[17:43:25] <mst> xenu: " they act like die() or warn()"
[17:43:28] <mst> it could be better written
[17:43:29] <xenu> "they"
[17:43:31] <xenu> what is they
[17:43:34] <xenu> there are 4 functions
[17:43:39] <mst> oh fuck off xenu
[17:43:43] <mst> read the rest of the sentence
[17:43:53] <revhippie> heh pronouns
[17:44:17] <LeoNerd> \PicardLightsMeme{THERE ARE FOUR FUNCTIONS!}
[17:44:36] <Altreus> have to be honest, telling me what *I* did wrong is far better than telling me what the module I used wrong did wrong
[17:44:47] <Altreus> why don't we use carp all the time?
[17:44:52] <mst> hethw: anyway, yeah, the Carp functions plus Data::Dumper are your best friend when debugging
[17:44:54] <xenu> mst: no, seriously, the part you quoted doesn't say which one acts like die() and which one like warn()
[17:44:56] <hethw> mst, nice. this works great. is there any way to also trace beyond evals?
[17:44:59] <mst> Altreus: because people suck
[17:45:11] <mst> hethw: it traces all the way to the top of your script, what are you talking about
[17:45:23] <Altreus> I'm in this picture and I don't like it
[17:45:27] <xenu> anyway i expect that the documentation should just describe each function individually, like perlfunc
[17:45:36] <hethw> mst, well, there are places where the function was called in an eval {} block
[17:45:39] <mst> hethw: please actually *try* the advice
[17:45:40] <hethw> it stops there
[17:45:43] <mst> hethw: no it doesn't
[17:45:46] <LeoNerd> xenu: The docs describe the four functions in terms of their properties. A&B act like die, C&D like warn. A&C print the full message, B&D print shorter ones
[17:45:47] <hethw> I just did
[17:45:52] <LeoNerd> Now just map the letters A to D to the four function names
[17:45:54] <hethw> hm.
[17:46:06] <mst> hethw: seriously, it doesn't.
[17:46:25] <hethw> I believe you. I'll try to understand what is happening then
[17:46:37] <xenu> LeoNerd: that would've been true if the first sentence started with "croak & carp" not "The Carp routines"

[19:32:54] <ether> "why did the mathematicians' marriage fail?" "they thought all arbitrary unions were open"
[19:33:11] <revhippie> ether: boooooooo
[19:34:52] <The_Blode> Good evening Perlites.
[19:35:08] <The_Blode> Quick one. If I want to use a constant in Perl, is there any way I can address it with $?
[19:35:27] <The_Blode> Say I am using a variable that is called in the script as $var
[19:35:31] <thrig> meanwhile there's `go doc` which contains random margin notes and little useful information
[19:37:06] <xenu> The_Blode: not with 'use constant', you need something like Const::Fast or ReadonlyX
[19:37:20] <choroba> Depends on what you mean by "constant"
[19:37:22] <The_Blode> Thank you.
[19:37:37] <mjgardner> The_Blode: There are a number of modules that do that. I favor Const::Fast. Neil Bowers wrote an excellent review of the options here: http://neilb.org/reviews/constants.html
[19:37:38] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ CPAN modules for defining constants ]
[19:37:39] <The_Blode> How can I address a constant? Like this print CONSTANT;
[19:37:42] <ether> why is addressing it with '$' important?
[19:38:10] <The_Blode> I'm doing a code review and the developer is using a variable in a constant like fashion. Changing the original declaration will have consequence to the uses.
[19:38:23] *** Quits: jdltouraine (~jdltourai@2a02:a03f:847b:b800:913c:73e9:9979:f03) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[19:38:24] <The_Blode> So all uses must be converted to constant value right?
[19:38:40] <choroba> there are two aspects of a constant: 1. it's not changing 2. it can be inlined. There are various solutions that provide different amounts of 1 and 2.
[19:38:54] <mjgardner> The_Blode: If you're declaring them with `use constant` then the constant is just an inline function and you can do things like `print CONSTANT`. Constants aren't a native feature of the language.
[19:39:18] <The_Blode> I understand. Thank you guys.
[19:39:24] <The_Blode> I mean, one example I have is
[19:39:27] <choroba> mjgardner: it's not a function anymore, but can be imagined as being one.
[19:39:34] <The_Blode> my $underscore = "_";
[19:39:38] <mjgardner> choroba: I'm simplifying.
[19:39:39] <The_Blode> Which I thought should be a constant.
[19:39:54] <The_Blode> Am I correct in the assumption or nitpicking?
[19:39:58] <choroba> it's quote common to use $UNDERSCORE for global variables that noone should change.
[19:40:29] <The_Blode> Also, I have encouraged this new developer to use strict mode.
[19:40:35] <The_Blode> Again, am I being too harsh here?
[19:40:40] <mjgardner> No you're not.
[19:40:46] <The_Blode> Strict would reveal tonnes of errors in on compilation.
[19:40:47] <choroba> I'd require all caps at least
[19:41:10] <The_Blode> Also, they're initialising a tonne of variables without using them.
[19:41:11] <thrig> a better question is why they aren't using strict already
[19:41:20] <The_Blode> They're new to Perl.
[19:41:43] <thrig> where are they learning from that didn't recommend strict?
[19:41:43] <The_Blode> This code review may go down as quite harsh as it needs work.
[19:42:03] <The_Blode> Well, they were hired in without Perl knowledge and this is their first Perl script.
[19:42:09] <The_Blode> So they're getting their feet wet so to speak
[19:42:22] <mjgardner> The_Blode: There's a book called "Perl Best Practices" by Damian Conway that's worth looking at. Nothing in it is set in stone, but there are lots of good ideas in there. And there is a module called Perl::Critic (and its command `perlcritic`) that can check your code for compliance with code review policies.

[19:42:55] <The_Blode> Well, I have noticed variables being declared and sometimes initialised but never used in the script.
[19:42:58] <Grinnz> mjgardner: The_Blode: note that neilb post is excellent but a bit outdated, ReadonlyX was released since then and provides similar capability to Const::Fast as well
[19:43:05] <The_Blode> Will Perl cry about this?

[19:43:36] <Grinnz> it will allocate space for them yes
[19:43:42] <mjgardner> The_Blode: If you also say `use warnings;` then Perl will issue a warning about unused variables.

[20:03:07] <The_Blode> I had an argument with a senior colleague a few weeks back. He told me that as a rule of thumb, Perl scripts exit with "exit 1"
[20:03:23] <The_Blode> I told him I had consulted the Perl experts and they told me "exit" is completely fine for a successful exit call.
[20:03:31] <The_Blode> And that "exit" = "exit 0" which means success.
[20:03:36] <mjgardner> The_Blode: That's patently false. That indicates an error to the process that ran the script.
[20:03:40] <The_Blode> "exit 1" indicates an error not success
[20:03:42] <Grinnz> The_Blode: if you mean whitespace, no that doesn't affect perl
[20:03:49] <Grinnz> the parser skips it
[20:04:15] <The_Blode> I referred him to the perldoc which states "exit" is the equiv of "exit 0"
[20:04:18] <The_Blode> Meaning success.
[20:04:19] <Grinnz> and yes, exit 1 indicates an error
[20:04:34] <The_Blode> This is someone who's been doing Perl for 20 years feeding me false info.
[20:04:39] <Grinnz> wild the things people come up with
[20:04:52] <The_Blode> So like that person said earlier, just because someone has been doing something a long time, doesn't mean they are the best at it

[20:06:55] <Grinnz> perl is heavily shell inspired yes

[20:07:27] <The_Blode> Or Shell rather

[20:26:12] <Grinnz> 'my' variables in the global scope are not globals
[20:26:15] <ilmari> if you declare it as `my`, that's not a global
[20:26:18] <Grinnz> they're just file-scoped
[20:26:24] <ilmari> in the top-level file scope
[20:26:35] <The_Blode> Oh
[20:26:39] <ilmari> that's still not global, each file has its own top-level scope
[20:26:46] <Grinnz> real globals are package variables, which is what you get when you don't use "my" and try to use a variable, and why strict prevents that from happening
[20:26:46] <mjgardner> https://perldoc.perl.org/functions/my  or `perldoc -f my` is instructive.
[20:26:47] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ my - Perldoc Browser ]
[20:27:40] <Grinnz> any part of the code can access and modify a package variable and it's very difficult to know when or why
[20:27:48] <The_Blode> If $var is false, will Perl throw me an error here; my $var = 2; if ($var eq "1") { my $var_two = 2; } if ($var_two == 2) {
[20:28:21] <The_Blode> Can it run the check on the undefined $var_two
[20:28:25] <Grinnz> it will fail to compile that because you still haven't declared $var_two in that scope
[20:28:25] <_73> Is there a term for a lexical variable defined in a packages outermost scope?
[20:28:36] <The_Blode> Thanks
[20:28:37] <ilmari> The_Blode: try it and see!
[20:28:37] <Grinnz> (with strict)
[20:28:39] <mjgardner> The_Blode: It will run just fine if you don't `use strict`. But it won't do what you expect.
[20:28:49] <ilmari> _73: lexical variables have nothing to do with packages
[20:28:53] <The_Blode> I'm promoting strict within my team
[20:28:56] <mjgardner> Which is why you should `use strict`.
[20:28:59] <ilmari> and warnings
[20:29:06] <The_Blode> So some reworking is required here
[20:29:11] <The_Blode> And warnings yes
[20:29:36] <The_Blode> What is the scope when the variables are declared at the top of the file
[20:29:38] <Grinnz> _73: packages can be anywhere and may or may not be associated with one or more scopes
[20:29:39] <The_Blode> File-level global?
[20:29:42] <The_Blode> Script scope global?
[20:29:51] <Grinnz> _73: lexicals only care about the surrounding {} or file
[20:30:03] <Grinnz> The_Blode: file-scoped lexical
[20:30:07] <mjgardner> The_Blode: Should we assume you've got `use strict` for your questions from here on? Because I'm not sure I can make that assumption for your team.
[20:30:11] <The_Blode> Awesome thank you
[20:30:14] <Grinnz> it's not really a global at all, because no other file will be able to see it
[20:30:24] <The_Blode> This script I'm reviewing has no strict enabled
[20:30:32] <ilmari> start with fixing that :)
[20:30:34] <The_Blode> Well, global in the current file's sense
[20:30:38] <Grinnz> but since it's globally visible to that file, sometimes it's referred to as a global 
[20:30:50] <The_Blode> file-scoped lexical though :)
[20:30:51] <ilmari> "top-level" or "file" scope is more precise
[20:30:52] <_73> I think I wanted to ask The_Blode's question, but they stated it more clearly.
[20:31:11] <The_Blode> Top level or File scope will be easier to remember I guess
[20:31:21] <The_Blode> But I could flex my Perl knowledge with file-scoped lexical lol
[20:31:39] <The_Blode> Basically, I can refer to such variables in any part of the script
[20:31:45] <The_Blode> Inside conditionals or loop and inside functions
[20:31:49] <Grinnz> in that file, yes
[20:32:02] <The_Blode> Yes only within the scope of the script it's running in
[20:32:04] <Grinnz> but say if you call a function from a module, that function can't access it by name

[20:48:42] <EvanCarroll> Or whether Rust, which has is far more complex to learn but technically better in every way, will eventually look more like the future.
[20:48:49] <Grinnz> EvanCarroll: *doubt* to both
[20:49:09] <Grinnz> too many people hate go, and rust doesn't have the whippitupitude
[20:49:29] <LeoNerd> Go is a fine language if you think C's habit of having to check error conditions after every function call is Just Fine
[20:49:41] <LeoNerd> For anyone else who's ever seen proper structured exception handling, they dislike it
[20:49:43] <mst> and ES6's JIT has made it -stupidly- fast for a lot of things
[20:50:08] <Grinnz> my prediction is rust and JS coexistence for most things until some new trend comes along
[20:50:35] <EvanCarroll> LeoNerd: Go isn't my choice, but you have to do that *ANYWAY* in Perl, Python, Ruby, and PHP, so again the question is what is holding Go back from dominating this space -- it's faster, has better tooling, compiles statically (more fit for containers) etc.
[20:50:41] <mjgardner> Again, "X kills Y" is boring.

[21:10:58] <EvanCarroll> LeoNerd: at some point, I agree with you, and at another point I think that any linter is smart enough to warn you Go for unhandled errors, and that still makes the behavior far more predictable then in interpreted languages of Perl's generation.

[21:20:46] <The_Blode> Cargo cult = copy paste haulage
[21:20:49] <ilmari> or Result<T, Infallible>, if you're implementing a fallible API, but the concrete implementation can't fail
[21:21:07] <EvanCarroll> Grinnz: agreed fully, and not leaky violations of them so everything must be caught, etc. I mean flagging things and forcing users to put external code behind try-tiny seems like best practice in Perl.
[21:21:11] <ilmari> (soon to be Result<T, !>, where ! is the "never" type)
[21:21:20] <EvanCarroll> And that's more or less what Go forces.
[21:21:33] <EvanCarroll> ilmari: btw, I agree fully. I think rust's error handling is the best.

[21:22:00] <Grinnz> EvanCarroll: it doesn't force you to. unhandled exceptions propagate to your normal exception handling mechanism, or usefully ending the script
[21:22:19] <ilmari> it's the return type of expressions that don't return, like like panic!() and return
[21:22:22] <Grinnz> thus, less boilerplate required for the normal case
[21:22:54] <_73> LeoNerd: I see why it is better to use an anonymous sub now. It allows you to have a data structure in the outer scope unlike the way I was doing it. 
[21:23:07] <ilmari> Grinnz: in Rust the boilerplate is one whole character: `?`
[21:23:22] <Grinnz> ilmari: we were talking about go
[21:24:53] <ilmari> Grinnz: the omnipresent `if err != nil { return nil, err }` in go drives me nuts
[21:25:02] <Grinnz> right, that's the problem
[21:25:18] <ilmari> _and_ it's not enforced by the compiler
[21:25:33] <xenu> the funny thing about papal infallibility is that it applies only when the pope speaks ex cathedra, which basically means "i mean this for real!"
[21:25:37] <Grinnz> stack frame propagation is a requirement if you want sane error handling for any reasonably complex piece of code
[21:25:40] <xenu> and this happened only twice in the history
[21:25:40] <jabberwok> is » panic!() « pronounced with Victor Borge's audible punctuation ? it certainly should be.
[21:25:42] <ilmari> and I'm sure there are things that return _both_ a value and an error
[21:25:45] <EvanCarroll> Grinnz: you mean you can propagate them up explicitly with ?, well sure. It's a macro for more chars in Go you write the chars out `if err != nil { return errors.New(err) }` or whatever.
[21:26:21] <Grinnz> it's the same reason that error handling in callback-based async apis is hell
[21:26:28] <Grinnz> and promises/futures/async/await is way better
[21:26:35] <Grinnz> because they propagate failures automatically
[21:27:31] <Grinnz> _73: closures are very useful
[21:27:45] <Grinnz> particularly in order to put the data in a specific place

[21:35:13] <ilmari> Grinnz: I like the balance in Rust. you have to think about it, but propagating it adds very little overhead. and you can tell a lot about a function from the signature: is it fallible, does it consume, mutate or merely borrow its arguments?
[21:35:50] <thrig> borrow wights. very dangerous. you go first
[21:36:01] <Grinnz> i still think it should be automatic until the level that is prepared to handle it - otherwise someone will forget sometime, and errors explode things or go to the abyss
[21:36:11] <ilmari> Grinnz: the compiler won't let you not
[21:36:12] <Grinnz> but minimal boilerplate does make it much nicer
[21:36:17] <Grinnz> oh, in that case
[21:36:35] <ilmari> you _cannot_ get at the value inside a Result without doing something explicit to it
[21:36:41] * Grinnz really needs to pick up rust one of these days
[21:36:49] <ilmari> ?, .unwrap(), .or() etc
[21:37:08] <ilmari> in go it's far too easy to ignore the err and get a nil pointer panic at runtime

[21:37:38] <ilmari> yeah, if you scatter .unwrap() willy-nilly in your code, you will get runtime panics
[21:37:41] <Botje> Grinnz: careful for tetanus
[21:37:56] <ilmari> but that's a clear, obvious, code smell and should only be done in top-level applicaiton code prototypes
[21:38:08] <LeoNerd> _73: they're exactly like what a lot of other langauges call "lambda", indeed

[23:59:01] <Grinnz> dirhandles can't be printed directly, you have to use readdir on them to read the contents of the dir

[23:59:54] <Grinnz> and as long as you use the 'my $dh' form and not the bareword handle form, you don't need to call closedir yourself
