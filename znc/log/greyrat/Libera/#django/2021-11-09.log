[00:33:06] <FunkyBob> theseb: it's generally recommended you not do that... perhaps you want a dedicated task queue system, like dramatiq?
[00:33:11] <hylje> theseb: no fundamental problems, but you should be careful about how many processes you spawn, their life cycle, resource usage... if you spawn more processes than your resources can handle it'll just grind into a halt and force you to restart everything
[00:33:49] <hylje> task queues generally handle this sort of thing for you with fewer surprises

[01:17:51] <theseb> FunkyBob: besides Popen..is there anything in the stdlib that works?
[01:19:37] <FunkyBob> popen isn't really the issue [but yes, there's a bunch of multiprocess stuff]

[01:26:16] <moldy> multiprocessing / threading is fine in management commands though
[01:26:24] <FunkyBob> with dramatiq, there's a posgres base broker, too, so you don't need a separate queue tool

[01:42:25] <FunkyBob> hi, Paul
[01:42:52] <PaulWay[w]> Still trying to work out how I can get Django + Postgres to calculate a number of seconds between a datetime field and Now(), rather than the 'age()' string...
[01:44:09] <FunkyBob> didn't you resolve that
[01:44:26] <FunkyBob> annotate(age=F('somefield') - Now()) ?
[01:44:41] <FunkyBob> oh, as seconds... Extract?

[02:05:09] <FunkyBob> then again, an interval will come out as a timedelta, which can tell you seconds

[10:57:01] <gkarthik> Hi, I have extended the AbstractBaseSession to create a custom session model and stored it in a module in the root directory of django app. I have also set the SESSION_ENGINE to point to this module. But on running the makemigrations, no table is created. Ref -
[10:57:02] <gkarthik> https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/http/sessions/#extending-database-backed-session-engines.
[10:57:48] <gkarthik> code https://dpaste.org/JH3w
[10:59:03] <gkarthik> From the code you can see that model name is VKSession which is not created.
[11:01:53] <FunkyBob> gkarthik: so that's in a models.py inside an app listed in INSTALLED_APPS ?
[11:03:50] <gkarthik> FunkyBob: no the code is in the session_backend.py module which is in the app list listed in INSTALLED_APPS. This module is being pointed to SESSION_ENGINE in settings
[11:04:20] <FunkyBob> that'd be why migrations isn't finding it

[12:05:05] <serafeim> could you remind me how to export a django queryset to json ?
[12:05:12] <serafeim> i remember that django has a builtin serialiezr
[12:05:17] <serafeim> but can't find it niow
[12:06:47] <serafeim> here probably https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/serialization/
[12:10:04] <LordKalma> serafeim, https://www.django-rest-framework.org/
[12:10:12] <LordKalma> I didn't even know django has built in serialization
[12:10:17] <LordKalma> rest-framework does amazing magic
[12:10:53] <serafeim> no no i don't want to include rfp to my deps
[12:11:22] <LordKalma> understandeable
[12:11:39] <serafeim> the django serialization is fine
[12:12:59] <LordKalma> speaking of serialization
[12:13:46] <LordKalma> if I want to write a very custom serializer, and I mean *very* custom (translating my database into csv files with very specific formats for other software, for example), you think DRF is up for it?
[12:14:11] <FunkyBob> serafeim: there is that one built in, but it's quite limited
[12:14:29] <FunkyBob> LordKalma: there's quite a few tools that can tackle that
[12:14:43] <serafeim> well it works in my case :)
[12:14:50] <FunkyBob> DRF's serialisers, nap's Mappers,
[12:15:04] <FunkyBob> and then the generic, not-django-specific libs
[12:15:07] <LordKalma> FunkyBob, I'm asking if it's something you'd do with DRF. I already am using DRF as a REST api backend
[12:15:15] <LordKalma> yeah, I could use Pandas for it, I know
[12:15:24] <LordKalma> Just asking about something I'm already using haha
[12:17:34] <FunkyBob> into CSV?  well,
[12:17:43] <FunkyBob> I personally wouldn't use DRF, as I don't know it.
[12:17:56] <FunkyBob> I would use nap, because I wrote it [and it includes a high speed CSV serialiser
[12:18:56] <FunkyBob> then again, python includes a CSV lib...
[12:19:09] <FunkyBob> so with some careful queryset construction, you can avoid all that work entirely

[12:20:40] <LordKalma> Thanks :) I'll keep that in mind for when i come to it
[12:24:59] <serafeim> in the django annotations we can do something like `q = Book.objects.annotate(Count('authors'))` to get the nmmber of authors each  book has. however how could i get the queryset of authors for each book ?
[12:26:52] <serafeim> i.e q = Book.objects.annotate(authors=SOMETHING)
[12:29:21] <serafeim> do i need to use ArrayAgg or something ?
[12:29:25] <serafeim> or is ther a better way ?
[12:29:35] <serafeim> i am not fond of ArrayAgg because i can't use it on sqlite

[18:54:16] <pycode> GinFuyou, if i do {{ widget }} inside the loop
[18:54:24] <pycode> i see
[18:54:25] <pycode>  {'name': 'section-form-0-0-features_0', 'is_hidden': False, 'required': True, 'value': None, 'attrs': {'class': 'form-control', 'placeholder': 'Nota', 'maxlength': '128', 'id': 'id_section-form-0-0-features_0'}, 'template_name': 'django/forms/widgets/text.html', 'type': 'text'}
[18:55:07] <pycode> the problem is that it has an error but i need to check it because i must change the html
[18:55:24] <pycode> i need to use another class instead of that "bg-muted"

[18:56:17] <pycode> GinFuyou, ?
[18:57:31] <GinFuyou> yea, I think I'm wrong about it. default widgets at least only responsible for rendring input and value

[18:59:26] <GinFuyou> I'm mixing up with my experience of using sniplates widget, which don't substitute django widgets
[18:59:41] <pycode> GinFuyou, here
[18:59:41] <pycode> https://bpa.st/SNVQ
[18:59:46] <pycode> this is my custom field

[19:00:19] <pycode> i can add something to pass a different class in case of errors?
[19:00:21] <GinFuyou> well, you can always apply styling based on parent block (that may know about error on field)

[19:00:56] <GinFuyou> I guess I'm not sure how to do it in django widgets alone
[19:01:32] <pycode> because in my case it is a multi-widget
[19:01:35] <pycode> so i have a list
[19:01:41] <pycode> that field has "errors"
[19:02:03] <pycode> but just one global errors to understand if there was something wrong
[19:02:20] <pycode> in my case i would like to add the errors in the widget directly instead of a global message
[19:02:40] <pycode> now i see something like: Item %(nth)s in the array did not validate:

[21:35:40] <strk> how does the PostgreSQL ORM work ? do you just define `class Somename` and it will map to "somename" PostgreSQL table ?
[21:35:50] <strk> or where do you define which class maps to which table ?
[21:36:01] <strk> as I'd like to try a switch between two different versions of the table
[21:37:23] <GinFuyou> ORM is not postgres-specific
[21:38:14] <GinFuyou> you can override default namings in fields arguments and model Meta class
