[14:06:52] <earnestly> As most people aren't literal skinwalker demons, lol
[14:07:06] <dodo> it's a stupid argument, and it's fine to point that out
[14:07:21] <dodo> if people want to argue again bitcoin at least they should't behave like total idiots
[14:07:29] <dodo> against
[14:07:30] <earnestly> Yeah I agree that pointing it out is useful for the audience
[14:08:04] <dodo> like "one bitcoin transaction uses X amount of energy", which is entirely wrong to begin with

[14:08:53] <earnestly> To be fair, because of the transparent nature of bitcoin, that sort of thing can be calculated with some degree of accuracy
[14:09:05] <earnestly> notice a linguistic trick they play though
[14:09:24] <earnestly> They treat energy consumption and energy generation as synonymous
[14:09:32] <dodo> yeah
[14:10:37] <earnestly> So it would not be worth them mentioning where the energy comes from, only that energy usage in and of itself is equivalent to generation and so energy use is directly correlated with climate change, in their view
[14:11:13] <earnestly> They also fundamentally don't understand that in order to provide anything of value requires energy consumption (as you mentioned 'every industry').  But they don't see any value in bitcoin
[14:11:36] <earnestly> Most people in bitcoin don't understand PoW, so it's not surprising most people don't either
[14:12:05] <earnestly> Still, it's more effective to point out the tactics
[14:12:06] <dodo> that's usually the first thing i say, people who attack bitcoin energy consumption fail to see the value it generates
[14:12:11] <earnestly> Than to debate on their terms
[14:12:35] <earnestly> dodo: Yeah, depends on the person, but it's often just the "well I have black friends" defense
[14:12:40] <dodo> tv in every room? fine. three SUVs per household? fine. a global miliatary force? fine..
[14:12:55] <earnestly> They don't use words literally, point out the tactic
[14:13:04] <dodo> but somehow bitcoin in the ten years since it exists has managed to ruin the planet, lol
[14:13:25] <earnestly> E.g. https://nitter.snopyta.org/pic/media%2FE3c2aR7WQAUMiSd.jpg%3Fname%3Dorig

[19:25:31] <belcher> the best way to convince him to get involved in bitcoin is to stack sats until he notices that the price has gone up and then he'll want some
[19:26:20] <glix> I just want him to understand bitcoin..and getting him involved by giving him some now so that he sees how much they have appreciated in value in like 2 years or so..
[19:26:40] <earnestly> glix: Horse to water
[19:27:49] <earnestly> It is sufficient that they are aware bitcoin exists, and what it represents.  Knowing basic economics is where to start, and from there bitcoin becomes the answer
[19:28:01] <glix> i know, but he won't care now but then in the future he will atleast have some so that he doeesn't feel left behind - like how most of us feel when we get started.
[19:28:15] <earnestly> glix: Hoard it for him then
[19:28:57] <earnestly> Plus I think in the future bitcoin will likely be a lot more user friendly with more services and such.  I only torture myself on bitcoin-core to learn
[19:29:54] <glix> earnestly: I agree
[19:29:55] <earnestly> That and I doubt everyone even wants to hold their own money, like they don't keep gold in a personal vault.  They would much rather someone else do that for them (not your keys, etc. withstanding)
[19:30:24] <earnestly> glix: So if you think they'll benefit from bitcoin in the future, but they don't want it, hold it for them
[19:30:47] <earnestly> Which I think allows you the charity without burdening them with something they don't want to worry about
[19:31:05] <earnestly> I started thinking bitcoin was a ponzi scheme
[19:31:52] <glix> earnestly: that sounds like a good - but I don't want to keep the seed for myself - giving him full custody
[19:32:15] <earnestly> Don't bother with seeds or such, just stick it in an address and look after it in the same "account"

[19:53:33] <nathanael> first: no one knows, second: probably up
[19:53:51] *** Joins: kico (~kico@user/kico)
[20:01:11] <Grayguy> thanks for the answer nathanael, mind elaborating why you think it will go up? won't ETH based coins or alt coins dominate and BTCD will go down since the mining is over and other coins got many supplies going for them?
[20:04:23] <nathanael> Grayguy: in my humble opinion the mentioned coin will not exist anymore and the value will probably go up, cause a global money represents all the things you can buy in the world (simplified) and humans create value over time (work)
[20:06:15] <belcher> Grayguy ethereum is crap
[20:06:17] <belcher> see https://www.reddit.com/r/EthereumScam/
[20:08:24] <Grayguy> nathanael thank you for the explanation
[20:13:14] <Grayguy> belcher that's a redpill material for me since i've been taught that ETH will dominate especially with the coming of greatly praised ETH 2.0. I will look into it, thanks for the information

[20:49:00] <belcher> "There have been six threads on fee sniping (by my mail reader's count), including ones discussing the mitigations which are *already deployed* in the production Bitcoin network."
[20:49:08] <belcher> some wham lines here
[20:49:37] <belcher> "Of course, no one is required to follow that stuff-- I certainly couldn't blame anyone for not, but if you're going to write about Bitcoin there is a certain cost in keeping track of what the network actually implements, right now-- much less the future. And if that cost is too great, perhaps it would be better to write in the abstract rather than claim applicability under a headline of "Bitcoin is unstable". Perhaps?"
[20:50:13] <earnestly> How does a university like Princeton, produce researchers that are this incapable of doing even basic research?  They are clearly not stupid people so I don't believe the argument to incompetence is valid
[20:50:14] <belcher> theres nothing wrong with academia, i have an academic background, but to claim something is automatically correct because it was published in an academic journal is just wrong and isnt how science is meant to work
[20:50:33] <cold> evolver only trolls here maybe lost some money
[20:50:35] <edcba> maybe it is marketing research ? :)
[20:50:36] <Evolver> It's not that it's correct or incorrect, just that it's a concern
[20:50:36] <earnestly> belcher: It's not only wrong, it's statistically likely to be wrong; lol
[20:50:44] <Evolver> cold: Stop fucking using that word you fucking troll
[20:51:22] <Evolver> I have pumped BTC online a hundred times
[20:51:30] <earnestly> belcher: (Replication crisis deepens every day because "peer review" is one of the worst possible methods of quality control and open to rampant corruption)
[20:51:38] <belcher> earnestly yep
[20:51:46] <cold> you dont troll in the programming channels you ask for help in, you only do antagonism in here
[20:51:54] <belcher> to be fair we use peer review in software, including in the bitcoin core project

[20:52:38] <edcba> yeah Evolver pump & dump coins without discrimination! leave him alone :p
[20:52:39] <belcher> peer review is necessary but not sufficient, peer review at least stops cranks and weirdos using the platform
[20:52:40] <earnestly> If software doesn't build, or doesn't produce intended results, it's an immediate validation

[20:56:32] <edcba> anyway easier to do bottom up and start with bitcoin

[21:03:28] <Evolver> glix: I would not donate any Bitcoin or crypto to anyone who doesn't really need or ask for it at least twice. That's unless the recipient is a beneficiary. It ends up being wasted, possibly lost. They have to want it first. In fact, if you donate it, they will value it even less than before.

[21:07:27] <glix> Evolver: I agree. But I do want my friend to be benefited from it. I know he will eventually get into bitcoin as he is a smart guy, but he hasn't given it time yet. I ended up scheduling an email on his birthday on March 2025 with the seed phrase encrypted
[21:07:35] <earnestly> It's not wasted though
[21:08:02] <earnestly> (From their perspective it probably is though)
[21:08:21] <Evolver> They're likely to just sit on it for five years and then there is a 50% chance they'll lose the key
[21:08:54] <Evolver> or come back to glix to ask what the key/phrase was
[21:09:20] <Evolver> or just lose the file altogether
[21:11:03] <glix> possibly yeah, but that file is sitting on the email server.
[21:11:09] <earnestly> Yeah, hold it for them in a wallet
[21:11:19] <earnestly> And once they're invested in it, give them the wallet
[21:11:31] <glix> and I want to completly forget about it
[21:12:06] <glix> I want it to be like a pleasant surprise..
[21:13:06] <glix> earnestly: I don't think I will be able to let go off the bitcoins later on :P
[21:13:40] <glix> I want to think of it as an investment for his future birthday gift..
