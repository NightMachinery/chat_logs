[00:25:56] <dD__> I have a machine and I get a grub rescue screen in which I set root and prefix.  After that, I go into GRUB2 but if i select my OS I won't be able to advnace, so I need to go into the command line by typing 'c' and get another grub rescue screen.  After that I run a similar exercise and I boot.   How could I figure out what's causing this and fix it?
[00:27:13] <Khepra> dD__: remove the "quiet" option from the grub entry you wish to boot into  (hit E to edit it, then remove the option from "linux" line), and hit F10 to boot. it should spit out more info and possible clues where it hangs
[00:28:55] <dD__> Khepra: thanks, and what about the first "hang"?  Would that give me info on that one?
[00:30:05] <Khepra> that's a tough one, especially since the device is obvs there if you can supply it manually.  from my experience, I'd say it's a botched grub install run. it didn't pick up where /boot is located and didn't encode that its own stages
[00:30:07] *** Joins: cluelessperson (~cluelessp@user/cluelessperson)
[00:32:47] <dD__> Yeah, I have a lot of bootable hard drives in that server.  The first one I have to set the prefix as in set prefix = (hd3,1).  On the second one I have to set the partition under dev (as in linux /vmlinuz root=/dev/sdc1.  It started happening after a kernel change that someone ran.  I'm going to try what you said but is there any way to sort of "fix" the installation while I'm booted?
[00:35:09] <Khepra> dD__: sure, run `grub-install` . any options to it depend on what kind of installation it is. efi? legacy? mbr, gpt...   if run in a chroot, you _must_ have /dev properly bound/mounted.
[00:35:29] <cluelessperson> how do you configure nfs daemon not to crash or get upset if a directory isn't available to share?
[00:35:45] <cluelessperson> I have some disks that are encrypted, and I'd prefer nfs not flip a table.

[01:52:22] <rawtaz> i have a somewhat generic question: i have a contianer in which a simple software that doesnt need to write anything relevant to disk (it can do so as any user, doesnt matter). it currently runs as root and im going to make it run as an regular unprivileged user.
[01:53:02] <xx> rawtaz: lxc/docker/podman/nerdctl/systemd-nspawn?
[01:53:24] <rawtaz> now, i can of course just create a regular user myself for the software, and use that. but looking at the pretty long list of standard users in the system, i figure perhaps i can just use one of those existing ones. is there some conventional one that's nice to use for a reverse http proxy?
[01:53:28] *** Joins: jbm (~jbm@modemcable079.243-202-24.mc.videotron.ca)
[01:53:48] <rawtaz> i see e.g. nobody, daemon, etc.
[01:54:07] <xx> rawtaz: just create any new user, that will have /usr/bin/nologin as the login shell and be disabled (meaning no password)
[01:54:11] <rawtaz> of course most of these are tied to some privileges
[01:54:23] <xx> /usr/sbin/nologin actually
[01:54:28] <rawtaz> xx: yeah, i can do that. but the question is - isnt any of those existing users already usable?
[01:54:29] <xx> and probably /nonexistent as the home dir
[01:54:37] <rawtaz> yeah good point
[01:54:39] <xx> rawtaz: they are useable, but you're not supposed to use them
[01:54:46] <rawtaz> what would the bad thing with using them be?
[01:54:54] <xx> e.g. nobody is frequently misused, but it is only supposed to be used for NFS
[01:55:23] <xx> rawtaz: the bad thing is that something else might randomly decide to use that user, and hence mess up whatever you created
[01:55:28] <xx> hence, create your own new user
[01:55:35] <rawtaz> inside this container the name of the user wont matter at all, i gues thats part of why it feels silly to create a user lol
[01:55:45] <rawtaz> sure. it wont happen in practice, but i get it
[01:55:46] <jbm> they're used for daemon processes, but they have no standard login, as from a login prompt, ssh, etc.

[01:57:26] <rawtaz> xx: thanks :)
[01:57:28] <xx> other users are not under your control - some package you install afterwards might start using them for example
[01:57:32] <rawtaz> ill create my own
[01:57:34] <rawtaz> yeh
[01:57:53] <xx> and that same package might decide to kill all processes owned by that user at some point for example
[01:58:00] <rawtaz> os just to be super clear; there's neither of those standard users that are put there for you to use when you want to run a daemon or something?
[01:58:07] <rawtaz> true
[01:58:16] <xx> you *can* but it is not a good idea
[01:58:30] <rawtaz> yeah. so neither of them were created with "here, use it" in mind as the use case for them so to speak
[01:58:49] <xx> not really, because it's trivial and advised to create new users
[01:59:15] <xx> the new user literally occupies just 2 lines of text on your entire system
[01:59:26] <xx> 1 line in /etc/passwd and 1 line in /etc/shadow

[03:35:06] <kittonian> or whatever it's called
[03:35:33] <kittonian> does anyone have any suggestions for me to try?
[03:36:14] <xx> make a backup, take note of any important settings, remove the package, purge the package, remove all remaining config files, install the package again

[03:36:49] <somiaj> kittonian: did you remove the sleep 10 at the head of the script (sorry just catching up)
[03:37:05] <somiaj> but the shebang must be the first line, you can't just change the first line and expect sctipts to still execute
[03:37:06] <kittonian> yes, and again that would have no bearing on anything
[03:37:24] <xx> kittonian: because that's how executable scripts define the interpreter
[03:37:39] <rawtaz> IMO the shebang should be the very first thing on the first line

[03:37:41] <kittonian> you all understand that it's worked for years right
[03:37:42] <kittonian> ?
[03:37:42] <somiaj> if the #!/bin/sh is not the first line the scipt cannot execute, that could be the reason why it isn't executing
[03:37:57] <xx> kittonian: things change
[03:38:19] <xx> something somewhere could have been running `sh /path/to/file` but is not running `/path/to/file` instead which breaks it
[03:38:21] <somiaj> maybe it was working before due to being run differently, move that sleep 10 line to right under the comments like about line 4-5
[03:38:27] *** Quits: crabbedhaloablut (~crabbedha@user/crabbedhaloablut) (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[03:38:40] <rawtaz> just make sure the shebang is the first line :)
[03:38:58] <kittonian> fuck me, i just moved it down below the bash stuff and sure enough that fixed it
[03:39:01] <kittonian> sorry
[03:39:02] <rawtaz> lol
[03:39:02] <somiaj> but I can totally see not having the shebang being the first line causing systemd to fail to execute the script, since it doesn't know what program/shell/etc to run it with.

[03:39:32] <somiaj> also adding something like 'sleep 10' in a script to fix something is a bad hack, it didn't adress or fix the underlying issue
[03:39:33] <rawtaz> kittonian: i never did not trust what you said, but at the same time, why not have the file properly syntaxed. even if one doesnt know that isnt a culpruit
[03:39:50] <rawtaz> somiaj: `sleep 10` gives more time for coffee at work
[03:39:56] <kittonian> it didn't occur to me that something that has been just fine for over 7 years would be the problem
[03:40:00] <kittonian> but apparently it was
[03:40:13] <somiaj> It is fixing a race condition that should have been fixed by ordering the scripts properly
[03:40:14] <kittonian> at least it's running now
[03:40:22] <xx> kittonian: we were just fine shaking hands and breathing onto each other for a hundred years ;)
[03:40:36] <kittonian> xx, you win best comment of the day
[03:40:45] <rawtaz> i was quite surprised when i tried a copy of your script here locally and found that it indeed did work when i executed it in bullseye. then i tried to remove the shebang entirely and it still worked. but i undrestand this is cuz i ran it from within bash, it wouldnt work if the system executed it directly
[03:40:49] <xx> !prize xx
[03:40:49] * dpkg gives xx a beer.
[03:40:55] <somiaj> My guess is sysvinit was using service to parse the script which already knew to use sh and didn't think of it as a executable
[03:41:03] <rawtaz> lol wtf theres a price bot :>
[03:41:25] <xx> rawtaz: it's just dpkg bot
[03:41:35] <rawtaz> somiaj: thats a very good theory indeed
[03:41:43] <rawtaz> xx: still a prize bot :D
[03:41:44] <somiaj> so at boot it was started via something running sh, but if anyone would have tried to run /etc/init.d/isc-dhcp-server {start/stop/restart} it would have failed
[03:42:06] <somiaj> so they were just lucky that it worked, because of how it was used, not that it wasn't broken
[03:42:40] <rawtaz> yep. happens to everyone at times
[03:43:09] <rawtaz> about 90% of the "IT Consultants" i meet in work..
[03:43:22] <kittonian> somiaj, actually no. i ran /etc/init.d/isc-dhcp-server all the time when making changes
[03:43:25] <kittonian> never had an issue
[03:43:43] <kittonian> but whatever. it's working now and i'm breathing a bit slower, lol

[03:44:53] <rawtaz> kittonian: its probably the same as why my test script here runs without a shebang and with the shebang misplaced - its because i run it from the shell that the shell is smart enough to just run it withitself anyway

[10:55:00] <se7en> First, I discovered that the python2 script for weechat, otr.py, stopped working due to its dependency on `python-crypto`

[10:55:25] <se7en> This is following an upgrade to newstable

[10:56:09] <se7en> I recall that during the upgrade, there was a changelog with an urgency rated medium explaining that behavior of python2 and python3 have changed, but I did not see anything major in this.

[11:06:04] <se7en> In the persuit to fix this, I downloaded something called `dh-python`. Attempting to reinstall `python2` it removes it and installed something called `python-is-python2`

[11:07:40] <jelly> set up an env. with debian 10 if you need python2
[11:07:45] <sussudio> this is why i don't upgrade until things stop getting security updates.
[11:07:53] <se7en> I don't want ot have to do that
[11:08:01] <oerheks> it should be py3 compatible https://weechat.org/scripts/language/python3-compatible/
[11:08:08] <se7en> Btw, both of those python cryptography packages are installed

[11:15:24] <jelly> se7en: Debian followed upstream in retiring python2.  It's been dead since 2020-01-01
[11:15:37] <se7en> I see
[11:16:58] <se7en> That cripples probably the majority of computers in existance due to unmaintained software
[11:17:14] <se7en> Am I just supposed ot never use any python2-based software again?
[11:18:08] <jelly> correct
[11:18:16] <se7en> That is terribly horrible
[11:18:21] <se7en> Someone needs to tell the cat-v folks
[11:18:28] <jelly> this process has been going on for like 4-5 years.
[11:18:36] <se7en> I was not aware
[11:18:52] <se7en> In such a case, I would think a python2 wrapper for python3 would be developed
[11:19:01] <PMT> i mean, the deprecation has been much longer, they just kept pushing it out
[11:19:05] <PMT> i think
[11:19:50] <se7en> The appimage has worked now, I guess I was using an outdated version
[11:19:55] <se7en> For pybitmessage, that is
[11:20:02] <PMT> se7en: the two are not easily machine-decidably interoperable. there are wrappers to give you a head start at some common transformations, but there are plenty it won't do.
[11:21:20] <se7en> For the script (I also posted to #weechat), this is the python error which produces when someone answers ther OTR query
[11:21:22] <se7en> http://ix.io/3EyJ
[11:23:40] <jelly> that looks like it kind-of works with py3, but probably hasn't been updated in a while wrt crypto apis
[11:24:34] <se7en>  I see. THis may be an issue for the script maintainer then
[11:24:58] <arh> Guys, can you give me any link to Debian wiki or official site that guides people how to upgrade from 10 to 11?
[11:25:15] <jelly> dpkg, buster->bullseye
[11:25:15] <dpkg> Read (at least) the upgrading chapter of <release notes> https://deb.li/39cyD . TL;DR: In /etc/apt/sources.list change "buster" to "bullseye", fix the line for security updates (see <bullseye-security>), remove stable-specific lines like buster-backports. apt update && apt upgrade --no-new-pkgs && apt full-upgrade. 3rd party repos like <dmo> cause problems with upgrades. If working over ssh, upgrade ssh first, see <bullseye ssh upgrade>.

[13:00:26] <abff> how do you make paranoid debian without turning it into gentoo
[13:00:28] <ede> keeping the infra secure is still a challenge
[13:00:39] <Khepra> abff: by turning it into LFS. gentoo infra was haxxed too.
[13:01:07] <abff> Khepra: I meant the compiling everything part
[13:01:13] <Khepra> btw... debian's signed repro model is vastly more secure than ebuild. ebuild can't sign except the (github) tree
[13:01:17] <system_error> abff> I dont think mess gentoo got is ok for paranoids :P
[13:03:04] <Khepra> unfortunately, proper security model assumes you can't trust the software you're running. thus you isolate, exert strict policies and monitor for them being broken.   something the OpenBSD folks don't really understand and think they can "pledge" their way into security, and no other mechanism (like MAC or isolation) is required.
[13:03:21] <ede> trustworthy devs using a secure environment to build the packages which are checked by others if they actually are what they claim to be.
[13:03:36] <ede> something along this path, with each step clearly defined.

[13:05:52] <Haohmaru> well it's definately a good thing to limit the amount of accidental security mistakes "mortal users" can do
[13:06:11] <Khepra> system_error: of course. somewhat. but OpenBSD has no other security mechanism. has no MACs. has no containers, solaris zones, bsd jails, or linux namespaces.
[13:06:56] <system_error> Khepra> have you ever seen how NetBSD came to OpenBSD ppl and ... shown them epic VM -> host kernel SNAFU?
[13:07:14] <Khepra> the whole model relies on the "human" factor and "correct code". history has shown the "human" factor to be errones over and over again.
[13:07:49] <system_error> Though some openbsd progs are neat regardless of that. Small, minimalistic, they leave quite few room for bugs.
[13:07:51] <Khepra> system_error: openbsd didn't "believe" in VMs until very recently, yes?
[13:08:37] <system_error> Yea. And they're imperfect and add new layer of complexity and imperfection. But sometimes it can do.
[13:09:12] <ede> they are nice to run something without the need to install it on hardware and reboot.
[13:09:25] <Khepra> system_error: minimal, do one thing well, properly pledged/capsicum'd/seccomp'd  programs are GoodThing(tm) yes. not if that's all there is to it.
[13:10:10] <Khepra> (yes I'm aware that seccomp doesn't fit in the same sentence with pledge/capsicum, not really having the same level of restrictions)
[13:11:06] <system_error> Khepra> I still like their small programs tho. They have some taste to security. Just eventually wonder too far into weeds failing to see other obvious shortcomings.
[13:12:02] <system_error> and namespaces... eh, Linux wasn't created with this in mind. So eventually it backfires. Most notably, users NS.
[13:12:56] <system_error> guess namespaces is kind of thing that is better to be early from  design start, but it wasn't a case, so many years ago nobody even had this idea.

[13:22:00] <system_error> Khepra> it's been fixed, but, still, it eventually causes some troubles. Well, guess eventually Linux would sort it out by force XD
[13:22:10] <Khepra> system_error: "so many years ago nobody even had this idea"  ..  you do realize solaris zones predate linux namespaces by many many years, right?
[13:22:25] <system_error> I'm not sure if solaris or bsd kernels were coded with all that in mind from scratch too.
[13:22:36] <randall> MWelchUK: I agree. Telling them to download the script, check it, and then run it would have been more helpful.
[13:22:43] <Khepra> and this "containers" thingy in linux is literally what BSD did with jails for years before but nobody cared. linux rediscovered the wheel and painted it black-
[13:23:32] <system_error> I'm not sure of timeline but not sure if there were Solaris zones when Linux just started and its been too late after this point anyway
[13:24:17] <system_error> Khepra> bsds were kinda painful to manage, in this sense debian is big win :P
[13:24:31] <Khepra> there weren't. solaris zones is 2005-ish tech, bsd jails 2000-ish tech, linux is 1990s tech
[13:24:34] <jelly> Khepra: AFAIK user ns didn't have one issue to be "fixed", it has dozens of tiny gotchas all over the kernel code and is hard to do safely
[13:25:05] <Khepra> well that's what I mean yes. parts of the kernel that weren't aware of uid mapping
[13:25:20] <system_error> i.e. more or less sane pkg management, ton of packages, relatively easy to upgrade/keep it going, sane notion of stability. BSDs never had anything comparable IIRC?
[13:25:32] <Khepra> can it still happen? sure. bugs exist. but I mean in general it's no longer a security issue as it was years ago
[13:26:08] <jelly> the way grsec says it, and debian kernel team, it's still an unholy mess that's best left disabled by default
[13:26:27] <Khepra> system_error: actually I find the BSD separation of "base os" and "third party ports" making maintenance much easier.
[13:26:39] <system_error> jelly> there're likely many gotchas as bolting such feature on top of pre-existing kernel is hell a lot of problem, it shakes up design assumptions down to foundations.
[13:26:40] <Khepra> jelly: debian enabled it
[13:27:00] <Khepra> and of course spender will shtpost against mainline wherever possible. has to drive them sales somehow.
[13:27:14] <Khepra> some of it is true, some of it is marketing, but I wouldn't put anything past him.
[13:27:35] <system_error> Khepra> and I find separation of base os and ports extremely ugly. Some weird-minded fellas push some crap on my head deciding what's cool for me?! Fits poorly my use cases.
[13:28:19] <system_error> Khepra> and ye I do minimal deb images doing debootstrap. Can't easily afford same in BSDs.
[13:28:30] <Khepra> nobody is pushing anything. they merely maintain one base os as a whole. installing freebsd for example is literally just unpacking base.txz somewhere. not even debootstarp comes close to that level of simplicit
[13:28:32] <MWelchUK> system_error Implementing any complex functionality, even if designed from the start, is likely to end up in bugs and logic issues being present that need to be fix.
[13:28:44] <jelly> Khepra: that's partly why I trust him on this, amusingly, if there's a real issue in kernel he won't be able to stop himself from schadenfreude
[13:28:46] <system_error> and as u can guess it sorta reason not to use BSDs for me :P
[13:29:11] <Khepra> jelly: true, but that's sometimes erring on false negatives :)
[13:29:47] <system_error> Khepra> I'm better off assembling OS of packages. Debian got some notion of essential packages, below which point even pkg management can break and it isnt debian, but its all.

[15:52:29] <Khepra> deksar: word of caution tho, PHP 8.0 is backwards incompatible in a lot of things, which is the reason it's not yet made available in Stable regularly, even though it predated Stable's release for a year or so

[15:55:25] <deksar> CentOS died - Ubuntu was horrible. I then thought I should go with good, old, vintage Debian. <3
[15:55:44] <deksar> Remember it was pretty stable back then - 90s.
[15:56:49] <PerfDave> deksar: "Support", yes. "Include by default", no, due to ZFS' license
[15:57:27] <deksar> I see..
[15:57:45] <PerfDave> I suspect Khepra can give you more details
[16:01:12] <Khepra> yes to both. "include by default" means it's apt install away
[16:02:16] <Khepra> ZFS is implemented as DKMS, just like nvidia and some other modules are. meaning hte package actually installs the source code and builds it on the machine that's installing it, and then automatically rebuilds on kernel changes. the process is mostly automatic and transparent.
[16:02:40] <PerfDave> But it might be a pain to have as your root fs at installation time?
[16:02:57] <Psy-Q> there is a guide for zfs root with debian somewhere
[16:03:07] <Khepra> the process is very straightforward if you know ZFS, but yes, requires debootstrap'ing, the installer doesn't support ZFS

[23:41:05] <nihilazo> hi! I just installed debian 11 on a laptop with xfce and it's all working great except hibernation and suspending. When I try to hibernate the laptop it shuts down instead (not a huge deal) but when I try and suspend (as happens when the lid is closed) and I re-open it, the x display is completely glitched out (tons of graphical problems), it then restarts to the login pagh, I can log in but when I do I'm back to an unusable,

[23:43:01] <nihilazo> the laptop is an acer aspire 5551. The graphics chipset is some kind of radeon but I'm not entirely sure what (I'll get an lspci in a sec). I need to check that xorg log

[23:44:06] <xx> best to only use suspend on laptops certified for linux
[23:44:08] <nihilazo> it's a mobility radeon HD 4225/4250
[23:44:50] <nihilazo> ah ok, I remember this laptop having suspend issues on alpine as well. Is suspend/hibernate often a problem on linux distros? (I generally don't use laptops much)
[23:46:10] <sney> it's hardware-dependent and many laptop mfgs make shortcuts that only work on windows
[23:46:50] <sney> sometimes efi updates help, though. and make sure you have the driver firmware installed for your gpu, it's in firmware-amd-graphics.
[23:46:51] <xx> and sometimes not even on windows
[23:47:08] <xx> (many bios updates required after release to make it work)
[23:47:52] <xx> It's probably because suspend to ram is still using some technology like ISA from the 80s
[23:48:07] <nihilazo> firmware-amd-graphics is already the latest version
