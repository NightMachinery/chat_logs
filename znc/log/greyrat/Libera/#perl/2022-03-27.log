[03:28:21] <xenu> secondly, when m// in the list context fails to match, it returns an empty list
[03:29:08] <dontyouloveshort> ah, rihgt...it works one time for the line that matches, but there it prints XYZ instead of a number

[03:31:18] <xenu> if you want to get the count

[03:35:41] <dontyouloveshort> no difference to what?
[03:35:50] <xenu> betwen $foo[0] and @foo[0]
[03:36:30] <xenu> $foo[0] returns a scalar, @foo[0] returns a single element list
[03:36:57] <dontyouloveshort> just reaozed that you wrote $cunt[0] earlier
[03:36:58] <xenu> the latter is problematic when you use it with something that requires scalar context (e.g. because of prototypes)
[03:37:38] <xenu> anyway, just always use $foo[0]
[03:37:41] <dontyouloveshort> why does $count[0] work anyway? if i accessing a array, it should always start with a @
[03:38:46] <dontyouloveshort> $count[0] should return X if @count[0] = "XYZ"  imho
[03:39:05] <xenu> sigils (outside of declarations) denote what you want returned
[03:39:11] <xenu> so when you have an array named @foo
[03:39:23] <xenu> $foo[0] returns a scalar
[03:39:26] <xenu> @foo[0] returns a list
[03:39:40] <xenu> %foo[0] returns a key-value list (0 => $foo[0])

[09:08:38] <Batshua> I spy a dngor!
[09:08:45] <rindolf> Batshua: hi
[09:08:57] * Batshua waves
[09:09:19] <Batshua> This is … shall we say … not my usual haunt. It has been a LONG time since I've been active in a #perl.
[09:09:39] <rindolf> Batshua: whats new?
[09:10:57] <rindolf> welcome back
[09:11:50] <Batshua> Well, I'm fighting with R.
[09:12:18] <Batshua> And one of my friends said it looked a lot like perl, so I'm mostly sitting here to get moral support via osmosis
[09:12:19] <rindolf> Batshua: R is detestable
[09:12:56] <Batshua> It's also not even … being taught? Like, we go over the *statistics* part of stuff in class, and then he sends us off to figure out R on our own. 
[09:13:09] <Batshua> We don't have an R textbook or anything, and I'm like alsjdflasjdf;lasdhfkasdlf
[09:13:23] <Batshua> My teammates think *I'm* the best coder on our team.
[09:13:32] <Batshua> I haven't had to write any REAL code since 2009.
[09:14:34] <rindolf> Batshua: sucks
[09:15:48] <Batshua> So I figured, moral support.
[09:15:52] <Batshua> Or immoral support, I guess.
[09:16:00] <Batshua> I'm not picky. (:
[09:16:05] <rindolf> Batshua: how old r u?
[09:16:17] <Batshua> Oh lordt,
[09:16:22] <Batshua> I don't think anyone here even knows.
[09:16:33] <Batshua> You're welcome to guess, but not on-channel.
[09:16:38] <Batshua> I don't want to give the secret away.
[09:16:44] <Getty> we are all old now
[09:16:50] * Batshua laughs
[09:16:55] <Batshua> Depends on how old old is, I guess?
[09:17:11] <rindolf> Batshua: can u  use scipy insteadof r?
[09:17:15] <ether> I guess 12
[09:17:21] <ether> either that or 85
[09:17:29] <Getty> ether: HAHAHHA that was also my first thought, but i didnt wanted to say it

[09:20:32] <Batshua> rindolf: No, because he wants R. I wish it was "however you get the right answer", but for this assignment, it's not.
[09:20:49] <Getty> meh
[09:21:12] <Getty> and then at some point someone need to refactor the complete platform which probably is split into 10 parts with 7 languages
[09:21:14] <Getty> :D
[09:21:20] <Batshua> For exams, we can use R, Excel, TI-84, paper, slide rule… basically anything except cheating.
