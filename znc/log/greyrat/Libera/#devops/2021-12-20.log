[14:31:22] <nakedeyes> i had a test run with graylog & docker, i've found it a bit resource intensive doing only `tail -f`. i had 10-20 containers running smoothly without graylog. anybody else satisfied dissatisfied with graylog? other worthy solutions worth trying?  
[14:40:53] <dodo> influxdb? have it on my todo, but i'm still dumping everything into elastic..
[14:52:56] <nakedeyes> yes, that is also on my list. the weak point appearently is not the storage (ES) but those java proccesses launched per container.
[14:54:08] <dodo> do you mean with the *beats? my apps log directly through the api
[14:54:33] <dodo> but then i already have a task runner anyway where this goes through
[15:11:38] <nakedeyes> the application itself handles log-ic -hah. not just stdout, but sending it directly.
[15:11:41] <nakedeyes> right?
[15:51:42] <dodo> yeah
[15:52:24] <dodo> by logging to a document db we can create rich logs.. though i guess you could parse json passed to stdout too ;)

[19:19:40] <Guest94> Hi, what are the options for distributing software? I saw JFrog Distribution but it seems too coupled with their ecosystem...
[19:49:13] <Joel> Guest94 that's an extremely generic question. What are you distributing, and to where?
[19:58:24] <Guest94> Sorry you are right. I need to distribute release artifacts to on-premise clients and have access-control for consuming binaries
[20:16:45] <shad> Does your git, CI/CD have integrated artificact management ?
[20:16:52] <shad> Gitlab and Github do have those
[20:23:10] <Guest94> No, we use the old-school SVN and Jenkins for building binaries
[20:23:30] <rawtaz> what a joy
