[02:02:51] <rawtaz> hi. quickie: is it "A line is outputted for each core of the CPU" or "A line is output for each core of the CPU" that's right?
[02:07:09] <LjL> i'd use the latter
[02:07:19] <mdogg> I would say the former, actually.
[02:07:21] <LjL> i suppose i wouldn't be too surprised to see the former in erm technical writing
[02:08:07] <mdogg> Hm..  Actually, maybe the latter is more correct..
[02:08:32] <LjL> i like this disambiguation page https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/outputted
[02:10:49] <LjL> anyway, if a general question were "do you still conjugate a verb like its parent form, including irregularly, when adding out-" i'd say we have other examples like "outdo" where the past forms are definitely "outdid" and "outdone"
[02:11:11] <LjL> on the other hand, in technical documentation "outputted" may be uglier (imo) but clearer in certain situations i suppose
[02:11:36] *** Joins: great_taste (~great_tas@190.32.235.20)
[02:13:55] <rawtaz> that wiktionary article just confused me
[02:14:13] <rawtaz> i always thought and felt output was the only proper one of those two, and that the former was written incorrectly
[02:14:51] <rawtaz> i just got curious now because i saw the former in text at https://docs.timescale.com/timescaledb/latest/tutorials/telegraf-output-plugin/#configuring-the-postgresql-output-plugin and it's a large company owning that text
[02:15:59] <mdogg> Well, in that case, 'output' is used as a noun.  The output plugin.
[02:16:32] <rawtaz> yeah but thats probably another part of the text than the one we're discussing here. they literally write "A line is outputted for each core of the CPU and the total" in one paragraph
[02:16:55] <mdogg> I would agree with that.  In that case it is a verb.
[02:17:14] <mdogg> A verb that describes something that took place in the past.
[02:17:21] <rawtaz> cant "output" be a web too? that "<something> was output"
[02:17:42] <mdogg> Was 'outputted' in that case sounds correct to me.
[02:17:43] <rawtaz> to me "outputted" is as dumb as "backupped" lol
[02:17:49] <rawtaz> hmm ok
[02:17:53] <mdogg> No, it would be "backed up"
[02:18:05] <rawtaz> yeah. but then i dont get why outputted is fine :D
[02:18:07] <rawtaz> but oh well
[02:19:03] <mdogg> You could say, "...The output was one line for each CPU core..."
[02:19:27] <rawtaz> yeah. that actually reads well )
[02:19:49] <mdogg> Or "is".. whichever.  It works both ways.  "The output is one line for each CPU core."
[02:20:06] <mdogg> Actually, that reads better than "outputted"..

[03:39:01] <furrykef> Hmm... trying to write about a (fictional) crime. Mr. J hires Mr. H to commit a crime. What terms do I use to describe their roles?
[03:39:14] <furrykef> I suppose Mr. J can be called the solicitor, since he's committing the crime of solicitation
[03:39:30] <furrykef> But Mr. H is what? Is there a more specific term than "accomplice"?
[03:40:03] <furrykef> "Executor"?
[03:41:47] <mdogg> It depends on the crime.  If Mr. J hires Mr. H to rob a bank, then Mr. H would simply be called the bank robber.  But if Mr. H was hired to kill somebody, then Mr. H would be the "hitman" or "hired killer".
[03:41:58] <furrykef> Right. I was hoping for a more general term.

[10:03:42] <mdogg> twb is correct.  "I _decided_ to attend a high-quality program..."  Or, "When I decide to attend a high-quality program.."  The tense has to be determined from the start of the sentence before the tense for other verbs can be determined.

[13:05:44] <ayaka> that book uses those words and write down his situation
[13:06:02] <twb> It's more common to use two columns

[13:06:49] <twb> "Should I dump my boyfriend?  Pros: big dick, cooks; Cons: ugly, smelly feet, his dog hates me"
[13:07:18] <twb> ayaka: I usually use "bonus and malus" because they line up (same number of letters)
[13:07:43] <twb> or "goodlist" and "shitlist", to replace old "blacklist" and "whitelist"
[13:08:46] <ayaka> malus doesn't appear in my dictionary, is it only used in British English
[13:09:06] <twb> it is latin
[13:09:15] <twb> same as "bonus"
[13:10:15] <ayaka> it is a little hard for us non European, we never learn latin

[13:14:23] <twb> It works the same for English -- English uses mostly German grammar, and mostly Latin and Greek vocabulary
[13:14:26] <ayaka> I should say comparing to the other European language, English maybe the most simple

[13:17:18] <ayaka> an episode
[13:18:25] <twb> I should have said English grammar is Germanic.  English is a Germanic language, but not the same as Modern German.
[13:18:58] <twb> e.g. you mentioned he/she/it/them his/hers/its/theirs
[13:19:11] <twb> in Old English, which is more germanic, ALL the words do that

[16:56:44] <bp99> eqw I am not sure about the exact reasons, but 'internet' probably gets a definite article because it is considered one thing. There is one internet, _the_ internet. On the other hand, 'calculus' (or 'predicate calculus') is just an area in mathematics, there is no 'one calculus', if you know what I mean
[17:02:00] <mdogg> eqwâ¦‚ Many things can be quoted from a book, but if a book is known for one specific quote and you are quoting it, I would say, "The quotation from the book; "[quote]"  So I agree with bp99.  
[17:03:08] <mdogg> One could ask, "Does the man have access to the Internet?"  There is only one Internet.  But one could also ask, "Does the man have Internet access?"  
[17:03:21] <bp99> mdogg: I replied to part (2) of eqwâ€™s questions, but I also agree with your comment

[22:02:30] <LjL> bp99, commas are overused in my opinion and bringing back the colon and semicolon can't hurt anybody
[22:02:48] <LjL> in your statement, i wouldn't cry foul for a comma, but a colon looks fine
[22:03:03] <LjL> and you also used a semicolon in the correct way, and most people don't
[22:03:10] <bp99> LjL: what about the poor semicolon
[22:03:13] <bp99> beat me to it
[22:03:29] <bp99> In my language, we also have semicolons but people practically never use them
[22:03:40] <LjL> the comma is very attractive because it makes everything looks more colloquial and "fluid"
[22:04:23] <LjL> but, like, i dunno, sometimes, you know, it gets a bit, uhm, not overused, but, maybe just kinda... oh yeah... some people do this a lot to... often without the trailing space ...which is very very annoying to me ...and yet ...it must look cool to them
[22:04:31] <bp99> I was asking because the colon feels a bit like itâ€™s introducing some some enumeration or at least separates the right hand side more than a comma
[22:05:02] <LjL> it is also explaining or completely whatever comes before it

[22:06:02] <LjL> you could also go with "The question is "To be or not to be?"." but then in some cases you get a lot of quotation marks and clashing punctuation, and then Americans start disagreeing with Britons on whether the punctuation goes outside, inside, both outside and inside...

[22:09:08] <LjL> to be fair, I literally had to backspace every time I typed the " ...x" version
[22:09:17] <LjL> because it was just so unnatural
[22:09:24] <LjL> but... yeah, i mean, i use it too... both of them
[22:09:34] <LjL> really there's nothing wrong with typing colloquially
[22:10:09] <LjL> but if that causes the comma to be the only remaining punctuation (maybe together with ellipses), it's still fine, but it would be nice if in situations where using more punctuation makes things clearer, one would feel comfortable doing that
