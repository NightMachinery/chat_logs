[20:47:16] <petrichor> I might have immediately gone and shared this with every emacs-related matrix room I'm in... >_<
[20:47:37] <bandali> woo! thanks for the spreading the word about it :)
[20:48:28] <petrichor> Speaking of which, is it worth adding to the conference page that you can also access this channel via matrix at #emacsconf:libera.chat?
[20:49:58] <bandali> sure, why not? would you like to do that?  instructions for editing the wiki are at https://emacsconf.org/edit/
[20:55:10] <petrichor> I'll give it a go! 
[20:55:29] <petrichor> Just wasn't sure what the etiquette was for the wiki
