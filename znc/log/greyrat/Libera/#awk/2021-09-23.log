[17:16:10] <geirha> sure it can. You get three fields there,  "", "" and "", separated by "12" and "34"

[17:30:51] <geirha> it works fine
[17:31:22] <geirha> it
[17:31:29] <geirha> it's just that it's rather pointless
[17:32:43] <nmz1> seems like you get the 3rd character
[17:32:46] <nmz1> so not that pointless
[17:33:19] <user51> nah, thats NF
[17:33:25] <nmz1> ah
[17:33:27] <nmz1> oops
[17:34:05] <nmz1> FS="." sets NF to the number of characters in $0 then?
[17:34:08] <geirha> # printf 'ABC\n' | gawk -F.. '{print "NF=" NF, "$1=" $1, "$2=" $2}'
[17:34:09] <nmz1> that's useful I guess
[17:34:10] <shbot> geirha: NF=2 $1= $2=C
[17:34:39] <geirha> here there is one match for the field separator, "AB", so you get the empty string before AB as $1, and "C" as $2
[17:35:58] <geirha> it's also unclear to me what you expected it to mean
[17:36:05] <user51> i thought "." means "match at least one character"
[17:36:16] <geirha> . means any single character
[17:36:46] <nmz1> # echo 1245.9.3928.756 | awk 'BEGIN {FS="."}{print NF ":" $0}'
[17:36:48] <shbot> nmz1: 4:1245.9.3928.756
[17:36:52] <nmz1> not a regex
[17:37:02] <nmz1> # echo 1245.9.3928.756 | awk 'BEGIN {FS=".?"}{print NF ":" $0}'
[17:37:04] <shbot> nmz1: 16:1245.9.3928.756
[17:37:10] <nmz1> is a regex and tells you length of $0
[17:37:12] <geirha> when FS is a single character, it's not treated as a regex
[17:37:59] <nmz1> neat
[17:38:08] * nmz1 snaps picture
[17:38:21] <user51> i simply wanted it to match a length, rather than a regex, so it would split $0 into 12, 34, 45, 78 etc
[17:39:11] <geirha> for posix awk, you'd use a loop with substr
[17:39:21] <geirha> for GNU awk, you could probably use FPAT
