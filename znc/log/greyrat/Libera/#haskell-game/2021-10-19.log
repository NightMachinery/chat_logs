[21:48:38] <ManofLetters[m]> huh? Windows apparently doesn't have stderr? and I render everything to stderr for reasons long ago forgotten and use stdout for stats
[21:48:53] <f-a> lol why did you use stderr
[21:49:07] <f-a> how can you debug.trace to stderr if you use it for your display xd
[21:49:40] <__monty__> inb4, all the rendering is done from "pure" code using Debug.trace.
[21:50:08] <f-a> haha
[21:51:50] <f-a> http://www.ariis.it/link/t/tiles.png wide tiles or narrow ones?
[21:56:39] <ManofLetters[m]> narrow but square
[21:59:50] <f-a> mhh
[22:00:01] <f-a> 2×3?
[22:00:06] <f-a> no
[22:00:13] <f-a> 3×2?
[22:08:42] <ManofLetters[m]> BTW, was I right trying to run my program on `cmd` console on Win10 are you supposed to use another terminal emulator (is there any other?)
[22:09:05] <f-a> what does win10 have by default?
[22:09:11] <f-a> win people won’t have isntalled anything else
[22:09:13] <f-a> powershell?
[22:09:24] <f-a> some will play with, what is that gnu toolchain thing on win
[22:09:29] <f-a> I forgot
[22:10:04] <ManofLetters[m]> cygwin? mingw?
[22:10:22] <ManofLetters[m]> I'm guess `cmd` is the default; will try powershell though, if I can find it
[22:10:24] <f-a> yeah cygwin
