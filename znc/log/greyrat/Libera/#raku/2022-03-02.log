[19:54:29] <melezhik> instead of saving authenticated users to database I used file system ...
[19:54:45] <guifa> That article does have me thinking‚Ä¶¬†does anyone know of any good hosting services that they can run Raku on?  I tried doing a compile of Raku on mine, but the shared hosting memory limitations caused it to not work
[19:55:15] <melezhik> but your approach is better I thinks, e easier to track statuses just by looking into db table
[19:56:38] <melezhik> guifa from my experience with doing a lot of Raku applications and serving them via different clouds and hosting, so far I am quite happy with Digital ocean droplets , at least this is a good value for money
[19:57:59] <melezhik> also if someone on a tied budget they might consider azure spot VMs - ready VMs with a good discount, but without guarantee they won't be destroyed one day ))
[19:58:24] <melezhik> https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-machines/spot/
[19:59:05] <melezhik> and yeas, any Rakudo web applications ( I guess most of the time we imply cro app ) is still quite thirsty in terms on memory
[19:59:10] <guifa> the pricing for DO doesn't seem too bad.  I was hoping for something in the $10-20/mo range for a side project I wanted.  I mean, I *could* write it all in PHP with my current host but meh.  I'd rather do Raku haha
[19:59:32] <melezhik> so you'll want at least 4-8 GB memory for reliable configuration
[19:59:54] <melezhik> guifa ++ ))
[20:00:25] <melezhik> I host https://sparrowhub.io on DO
[20:01:18] <guifa> Basically I've had an HTML/JS based scoreboard / scoresheet system for water polo, designed to be crazy cheap for schools to deploy (laptop + browser + HDMI cable to a TV)
[20:02:05] <melezhik> I have I think 8 GB with DO droplet and I host 2 Raku web apps, one Raku daemon app and 1 Perl app
[20:02:40] <guifa> I even had basic server code running locally for a while so multiple clients could control it simultaneously (mirroring a real world game's table set up) but it'd be much cooler to handle it remotely.  But it feels like a good time to try to learn Cro and get it set up on that
[20:04:47] <melezhik> I have a good experience with Cro. It still has some glitches, but I think it is ready for small and medium size projects for sure
[20:05:02] <melezhik> need to drop off

[20:30:45] <tonyo> p6steve: CIAvash i prefer the colon method call when it doesn't make the argument ambiguous..eg @arr.push: <some stuff>
[20:31:47] <tonyo> that style makes this type of thing ambiguous though:   @arr.push: encode-percents: 'xyz' if True
[20:33:40] * guifa does it similarly to tonyo
[20:33:52] <guifa> The one I don't see as often is the reverse colon call syntax
[20:34:02] <tonyo> reverse colon?
[20:34:17] <guifa> push @array: <stuff>
[20:34:27] <tonyo> ah
[20:34:28] <guifa> method $invocant: @args
[20:34:50] <tonyo> a strange artifact of perl
[20:35:18] <guifa> when doing more OO or functional code it feels out of place, but when you're doing some more old-school like coding, it feels more natural
[20:35:23] <tonyo> wasn't aware that even worked
[20:36:01] <tonyo> maybe it's an effect of doing haskell a bit but that pattern looks natural for functional
[20:36:40] <guifa> I just like the flexibility it gives.  Sometimes you want to put a greater focus on the action
[20:37:32] <guifa> implode $server: $message jumps out a bit more than $server.implode: $message
[20:37:59] <tonyo> that's convincing
[20:40:11] <guifa> the other time it's nice is for teh pretty
[20:40:40] <guifa> $a.push: @foo; $aaaaaaa.push: @foo; $aaaa.push: @foo
[20:40:49] <guifa> most folks would just add spaces between the colon and @foo
[20:41:07] <guifa> but then the push bit isn't lined up

[20:41:37] <guifa> reverse syntax lets you line up method, invocant and args much nicer since there's that extra <ws>
[20:47:27] <tonyo> also a good point
[20:48:11] <guifa> Only reason I've avoided it is because I switched to Comma and for a long time it didn't understand the syntax.  Haven't tried recently
[21:02:36] <tonyo> ah, i'm still using vim
[21:02:43] <tonyo> even for dayjob writing go

[21:53:41] <El_Che> tonyo: intellij is pretty sweet for go
[21:54:16] <tonyo> too much mouse use in IDEs for me. i have a browser plugin that allows me to browse using only the keyboard
[21:55:24] <El_Che> tonyo: I have a plugin showing the the shortcut every time I use the mouse
[21:55:27] <tonyo> goland crashes both of my computers (slows the m1 down to a halt, seems to try to use all 20 cores in my desktop)
[21:55:45] <El_Che> weird
[21:56:18] <El_Che> I use it on a 12 inch linux dell inspiron and an old apple air 2015/17 model
[21:56:43] <CIAvash> tonyo: I meant that `encode-percents` is not a method, so you can't write `encode-percents: config<gh-client>`, you would have to write `encode-percents config<gh-client>` or `config<gh-client>.&encode-precents`. Unless I'm missing something?
[21:56:44] <El_Che> on the mac it's slow starting (everything is), but works fast

[21:58:11] <tonyo> CIAvash: ah! encode-percents is exported by `Cro::Uri`, after all that code is explained you'll see a `use` block that imports that sub
[22:00:43] <CIAvash> yes, I know, what I mean is that it's a sub, not a method
[22:07:29] <tonyo> i think because it's not in the same package it's not interpreted as a label but as a sub in that package but now i'm not entirely sure
