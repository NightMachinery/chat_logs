[00:18:18] <beastwick> I have Debian running on ZFS root, and it's running well. I am considering using unstable and want to know what problems I could run into if I decide to hold back a kernel at a specific version.
[00:19:15] <beastwick> The reason being is that the ZFS module usually lags behind, so I can't just stay at edge with the kernel. Or at least, that is how I understand it.
[00:20:10] <sney> holding packages temporarily is a normal part of using unstable, and rarely does any damage by itself
[00:20:30] <sney> see some best practices at https://deb.li/sidfaq, and further questions should go to #debian-next on OFTC (note, right now you are on libera)
[00:20:50] <beastwick> what is OFTC?
[00:20:56] <sney> a different irc network
[00:21:12] <beastwick> oh, any reason why the networks are split? this freenode business really screwed things up
[00:21:28] <sney> debian has had most of its channels on OFTC since 2006, it's unrelated
[00:21:37] <beastwick> gotcha, ty
[00:21:52] <sney> !oftc move
[00:21:52] <dpkg> irc.debian.org moved to OFTC on June 4th 2006, see http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/05/msg00012.html . Operators and bots (see <fact sharing>) can also be found on <libera>. Questions? Ask in #debian on one or other network. See also http://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2006/04/msg00333.html

[13:39:02] <jelly> and changes to other packages happen in sid, not stable or oldstable
[13:39:17] <jelly> stable is not where development happens
[13:39:20] <xx> but if I need it to build in stable...
[13:39:41] <Khepra> I think it's irrelevant where development happens. is a <package> supplied for stable? that's all that matters
[13:39:42] <jelly> you can do whatever you want with your own custom packages
[13:40:00] <jelly> it's absolutely relevant
[13:40:02] <Khepra> iirc libssl1.1 was in the same pickle
[13:40:23] <Khepra> more precisely, dual versioning of libssl due to 1.0 and 1.1 incompatibilities
[13:40:54] <jelly> you don't make changes to packages in stable
[13:41:08] <Khepra> jelly: it's not relevant in that if a <package> in Stable requires a <dependency> of specific version... the question here was if rustc-mozilla was ONLY for firefox, or whether other <packages> in Stable may <depend> on rustc-mozilla
[13:41:24] <Khepra> unless I misunderstood the question
[13:41:25] <jelly> but that won't ever happen
[13:41:29] <Khepra> but it did for libssl

[13:41:56] <JackFrost> Presumably rustc-mozilla is alloowed to break compatibility, as long as it works for firefox.
[13:41:59] <Khepra> oh so rustc is _only_ build dep?
[13:42:05] <Khepra> not runtime?
[13:42:49] <jelly> firefox was a necessary-evil exception
[13:43:40] <Khepra> right, and because there's no NEW packages coming into stable, THIS particular instance is irrelevant, and Bookworm would already have newer than rustc-mozilla

[13:44:20] <Khepra> and I don't think this was exception. I think this will happen again for bookworm
[13:44:37] <Khepra> so maybe that's why they named the package rust-mozilla, so they can keep it just for FF dependency
[13:45:24] <Khepra> which is still dumb, but maybe I'm biased by source distros that don't do that and have slotted versioned dependencies where needed, like libssl vs libssl1.1 is in debian
[13:45:29] <jelly> it's still a firefox-only exception due to its exceptional support schedule

[17:02:47] <dokma> Khepra: the guest can ping it's default gateway
[17:02:56] <Khepra> dokma: which is the router _outside_ of the host?
[17:02:59] <dokma> from guest: ping 192.168.0.1 works
[17:03:09] <dokma> 192.168.0.1 is the router
[17:03:27] <Khepra> dokma: is the router configured to allow only specific MAC addresses?
[17:03:35] <Khepra> or even IP addresses? is that dhcp or static?
[17:03:40] <dokma> static
[17:03:52] <dokma> I have no idea if the router allows only specific MACs
[17:03:56] <Khepra> some routers will route only for IPs that are in its DHCP "domain"
[17:04:06] <dokma> It's not DHCP
[17:04:10] <Khepra> meaning, those routers will use DHCP and rooute only for IPs they assigned
[17:04:12] <dokma> Just static setup

[17:04:35] <Khepra> the router MIGHT want only IPs _it_ assigned via DHCP and ignores all others
[17:04:56] <Khepra> so if you set up static IP but the router never gave that lease, it might not want to route for it
[17:05:06] <dokma> router is set to assign DHCP ips from 192.168.0.10 to 254
[17:05:17] <dokma> But the host is 192.168.0.2 and has normal internet access

[17:07:18] <dokma> I appreciate the help
[17:07:20] <Khepra> Posterdati: therefore my suggestion to make /home nofail and make root able to login, and reboot with systemd.unit=multi-user.target  grub cmdline addition, so your xorg/DE doesn't start (which would want a /home)
[17:08:33] <dokma> Khepra: could this from the GUEST be the problem? https://paste.debian.net/1223946/
[17:08:35] <jmcnaught> "systemd.unit=multi-user.target" can be shortened to "3" on the kernel command line
[17:09:17] <Khepra> dokma: huh. so you can ping the router from the guest, meaning the packets are getting through. do you have any other functional port on the router wehre you can try full tcp session? ssh? telnet? web UI for admin?  try to access that from the gueset
[17:09:37] <Posterdati> Khepra: how could the system boot without an /home at all? It will be still unusable
[17:10:23] <Posterdati> the nofail option in /etc/fstab WON'T fix the RAID problem at boot
[17:10:30] <Khepra> Posterdati: you can log in as root, and if the system boots into "text mode" then no xorg/DE would be started that might want /home . this can be a perfectly normally functioning system as long as you don't start programs that require unprivileged users in /home/
[17:10:44] <Khepra> Posterdati: you don't understand
[17:11:10] <Khepra> Posterdati: the idea here is to boot into your system WITHOUT /home . So that AT LEAST you have a normal system , with networking and otehr facilities, so you can debug this further and be able to pastebin things.
[17:11:17] <Posterdati> No I understand very well that last update crippled my system!!!

[18:41:02] <Posterdati> thanks Debian!
[18:41:05] <Khepra> taht sentence doesn't make sense.   no superblock means no assembling

[18:41:14] <Khepra> once you assemble the array, teh superblock is irrelevant.
[18:41:28] <Posterdati> it cannot assemble the raid 'cause there was no superblock
[18:41:50] <Posterdati> thanks again Debian
[18:41:51] <Khepra> here you pasted examples BOTH with whole disk and with partition. I am willing to bet you also did that in your terminal. that's the most likely explanation. debian update absolutely did not do this
[18:41:51] <jkc> Posterdati: Not sure why you keep trying to blame Debian. Its your system, you did this. A poor craftsman blames his tools.
[18:42:03] <Khepra> Posterdati: there is nothing in the debian update procedure that would write mdadm superblocks
[18:42:08] <Posterdati> no
[18:42:26] <Posterdati> I only updated the system as per 11.2
[18:42:37] <Posterdati> and bang! No boot after that
[18:42:57] <Khepra> Posterdati: I use mdadm too. 11.2 update worked just fine, nothing is broken
[18:43:08] <Khepra> Posterdati: anyway, you can attempt this, I guess:   https://askubuntu.com/questions/69086/mdadm-superblock-recovery
[18:43:26] <Khepra> bascially, rebuild the array as if it never existed, while being careful NOT to overwrite filesystem metadata
[18:43:57] <Khepra> technically, partitions are just offsets in a table. mdadm metadata occupies beginning and/or the end of member device, the rest is content, or filesystem,  assuming this is RAID1, in theory, this should work.

[21:20:46] <shtrb> Any decent way to load  Windows recovery parttion after qemu crash without windows installation ? (I was loading a drive in qemu in bullseye , first time ever it crashed , when I restarted it I fulshly allowed the recovery process (big mistake it failed mid process) , now ever direct load from grub fail to start, and I'm failing to find a way to load the Win RE parttion from grub ).

[21:22:01] <anonimno> Hello all. Does anybody know, if there were breaking changes in ir-keymap related stuff in the kernel 5.10? My remote for controlling Kodi worked great with 4.19 in Buster. The same setup doesn't work so good when I boot Bullseye with 5.10, some key presses do not work. If I boot Bullseye with old kernel 4.19 from Buster everything is fine.

[21:40:02] <jkc> maher: run is a temporary filesystem. It's not meant to be managed directly, but by the services dropping stuff in there.
[21:40:02] <somiaj> this sounds like an XY problem, why do you need to change the permissions of /run (it is a tmpfs and set by systemd)

[21:42:16] <maher> in the past have changed permissions on /run/courier/authdaemon to be courier:Debian-exim
[21:43:18] <jkc> And that's not the way to do it. Change the configuration for authdaemon to have the permissions you need.
