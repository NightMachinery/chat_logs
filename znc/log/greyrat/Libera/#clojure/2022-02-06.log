[01:34:52] <Para> The major idea is that you don't do it year by year but like a few weeks at a time.

[03:41:31] <goodger> it's so vague that it might as well be explicitly NTS
[03:43:47] <sobel> yeah, the word is beyond sullied
[03:44:19] <sobel> i had a good experience with agile before i was hearing the term all around the 'net
[03:48:08] <manicennui> It's really more a high level philosophy, but the corporate world needs it to be a set of steps to follow.
[03:49:09] <sobel> and when it's encoded as steps, they will omit some steps and call the whole thing fragile when they try to increase velocity without enough planning
[03:49:17] <sobel> and everyone has a bad time
[03:50:03] <sobel> it's like running out of oil in your car. save ya some money!
[03:51:39] <sobel> as a very small team, we couldn't afford to build things of no use. so we put considerable effort into lining up the things we build with the skills we have.
[03:52:10] <sobel> customer meetings were negotiations about what skills we actually had on the team, in disguise.
[03:54:21] <manicennui> I don't think there is a set of steps that works for everyone.
[03:56:44] <sobel> agreed. a person needs to have some concept of business flexibility and enough skills to merge into a talent to be a decent candidate for applying agile approaches, imo
[03:57:08] <sobel> definitely everyone is not a candidate, and that's a problem for the box-checkers
[03:58:05] <sobel> it's one of the few things i am happy enough to just say, i'll know it when i see it

[18:23:21] <TimMc> sobel: Do you have a preferred SQL library that just handles interpolation?
[18:26:48] <sobel> on the java side i've been liking pg-client from the vert.x project but i have no idea whether it's fun making vertx futures work with clojure futures
[18:27:40] <sobel> i like that they use numbered parameters instead of order-dependent parameters like jdbc
[18:29:25] <sobel> at some point i meant to circle back to all the reactive patterns i've picked up from vertx to figure out something comparable in clojure
[18:30:13] <sobel> one of the most persistent responses i have to vertx when i adopt yet another piece of their ecosystem is: oh, clojure has this native
[18:32:19] <sobel> 1st class functions are way better than lambda syntax, even as de-tortured as they've made it
[18:42:12] <sobel> (i don't know if pg-client does interpolation. i'm preparing all my queries.
[18:42:15] <sobel> )
[18:44:23] <sobel> my use case might be weird. someone abused about 3,000 columns instead of implementing a K-V system so now i get all these KV maps to import, so i gotta construct a query based on the intersection of the table columns and the keys i get
[18:44:43] <sobel> every row is potentially different
[18:44:47] <Para> Sounds like MySQL optimization.
[18:45:19] <Para> MySQL joins used to be super expensive, so it became a norm to denormalize everything into these massively wide tables with no constraints.
[18:46:22] <sobel> if such an argument was made for the design i have now, it was a bad argument at the time, at best. i definitely made tables 200 times bigger (row count) without any trouble in 2002
[18:46:44] <sobel> slightly earlier, much buggier rev of mysql. 3.23 was horrible. 5.7 is relatively stable.
[18:47:03] <sobel> the horror that was 3.23 cannot be underestimated
[18:47:17] <Para> Have you encourtered multi-type tables?)
[18:47:50] <Para> "This column could be int or varchar(255), what shall we do?" "I know! Lets add column for type and then sparse column set for each possible type!"
[18:47:55] <Para> And value per row.
[18:47:56] <sobel> probably not... i've worked with table inheritance in postgresql but that's probably not the same
[18:48:13] <sobel> oh christ, that antipattern
[18:48:22] <sobel> definitely encountered that
[18:48:30] <Para> It probably has a fancier name.
[18:48:36] <Para> But yeah, stuff is wild.
[18:48:51] <sobel> i call it the "we don't know what we're doing here" pattern
[18:49:07] <sobel> if you might have an int, make it nullable.
[18:49:49] <sobel> if it might also be a nametag, then it's not an int. ever. it's always a nametag. but this kind of thinking hurts some minds. i don't know how to address that except put my foot down like an authoritarian and say RELATIONS DO NOT WORK LIKE THAT.
[18:50:25] <Para> Morbo the SQL Admin
[18:50:39] <Para> *DB
[18:50:46] <sobel> i might live a bit closer to the rigorous definition of relational algebra than the next h.sapien
[18:51:29] <sobel> i was the DBA i never had. i reached out to developers proactively because i knew they were going into performance-sensitive territory.
[18:53:14] <sobel> thing is, some devs will walk down the path of "bigger goals" with you and some won't.
[18:53:53] <sobel> the ones who think their problem description is the crux of the bigger goal usually bring me the most insane relational questions
[18:57:20] <sobel> i guess this is why i counsel any who ask to start with relations and SQL. whose object map (i'm not sure how this maps to lisps) is at least 2NF?

[19:07:35] <sobel> i used a custom migration tool before i discovered sqitch, then got a job where they used flyway. i didn't gain any special love of flyway because their use was so undisciplined, but that fact may imply good things about flyway. it was never part of the problem, overtly.

[19:11:38] <Para> People generally ruin all migration tools by not making the rollback/reverts.
[19:11:41] <sobel> 200 is rather a lot for a query in my system. i think 30 lines is about where i call it a "big" query, currently.
[19:11:54] <Para> Like...why do you even use such a tool if you don't really care about repeatability and disaster recovery.
[19:12:10] <sobel> Para: heh, yeah, it's the unit test issue just in a different context
[19:12:24] <selfsymmetric-mu> Para: Gotta check that checkbox on the new release, I guess
[19:12:36] <sobel> in practice i have yet to see a production operation that can survive a rollback. the rollback is for devs.

[19:13:31] <Para> Some years ago customer decided midway that we must support rollbacks. Well, our thing was built with Clojure and quite well parameterized so as long as data was there, it could repeat its work as many times as needed. But yeah, backups and all that.
[19:13:52] <Para> The demands ended when we pointed out that one of the five core data integrations doesn't support history views :)
[19:14:04] <sobel> hah
[19:14:23] <Para> And it was accumulating data source, only showing latest and greatest stuff.
[19:15:21] <sobel> that postgresql has transactional DDL has been a big deal for me. i basically don't have to plan for a rollback. my DDL either all works or it rolls back because its all in the same txn.
[19:15:49] <sobel> in a dev context, if i really need to go back a version, i reload a (data-reduced) dump.
[19:16:03] <sobel> or create a db from template
[19:16:17] <sobel> (oh how i love template dbs)
[19:26:32] <Para> sobel: what is that lookup table for?

[20:05:24] <Para> Depends where on the planet you live.
[20:05:59] <Para> Finland's been doing this neat little trick ever since the Ice Age where our landmass is constantly rising because the ice mass pushed it down by a lot.
[20:07:38] <Para> Iceland is literally tearing apart because it's on top of the Silfra fissure of two tectonic plates. Their national plate is on top of "nothing".
[20:09:47] <Para> *national park, even
[20:10:39] <tatsumaru> Sounds like Iceland is about to become Icelands
[20:11:25] <Para> Iceland is very new. The entire peninsula where Keflavik international airport is situated is only about 800 years old.
[20:16:17] <tatsumaru> Do you think most ocean-bound countries and states will go to *(&@ though? 
[20:16:30] <Para> meh
[20:16:45] <Para> I don't have the facts to assess such.
[20:17:16] <tatsumaru> I want to buy a little place somewhere in the souther hemisphere to retire and I am wondering if it makes sense or not.
[20:17:51] <tatsumaru> southern*
[20:18:20] <Para> I don't think most of southern hemisphere is politically stable at the moment.
[20:19:08] <tatsumaru> Thailand and Japan are pretty stable
[20:19:46] <Para> Both are on the Northern Hemisphere. Did you mean to say Eastern?
[20:20:37] <tatsumaru> It's official. I am apparently an idiot.
[20:20:51] <Para> Eh, it happens :)
[20:21:54] <tatsumaru> I thought this is how the planet works: https://imgur.com/a/aTVeVGE
[20:22:31] <Para> I mean it does, but majority of Asia is on the Northern?)
[20:23:17] <Para> Also note how most of Africa is also on the north side as well, even though people are conditioned to think they're "down there in south"
[20:23:33] <tatsumaru> Anyway it was a brainfart of some sort, maybe I was thinking they were in the Southern Hemisphere because they are close
[20:25:02] <tatsumaru> Japan isn't even that close
[20:26:04] <Para> I try to use mostly just 3D spherical maps for my place things these days.
[20:26:11] <Para> All projections fail at some point.

[20:28:00] <goodger> it may well be obsolete now, but it was in my geography textbooks fifteen years ago
[20:28:20] <Para> mmh
[20:29:11] <tatsumaru> There's some popular author who claims Miami will be under water in 5 years
[20:29:44] <goodger> (also, the fact that most of the earth's landmass and almost all its population is north of the equator means that our eye is drawn to a ‘centre’ line way north of it, somewhere around 15°)
[20:29:52] <goodger> tatsumaru: parts of miami are under water now
[20:31:02] <tatsumaru> goodger: is that how it's always been or a recent development?
[20:31:28] <goodger> tatsumaru: it's recent, due to the land sinking and the sea rising
[20:38:48] <tatsumaru> Interesting, most rising sea levels models don't show Greece as endangered
