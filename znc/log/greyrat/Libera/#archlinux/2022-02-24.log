[03:24:30] <red_> Edu4rdSHL: oh yeah
[03:24:56] <iqubic> So, I just attempted to do an Arch Install. Everthing seemed to go fine. But when I tried rebooting, I got a grub menu with only one option: boot into uefi firmware. Anyone know how I can use the live environment to fix this?
[03:25:24] <Namarrgon> did you follow the installation guide or did you use the archinstall script?
[03:25:51] <iqubic> I followed the installation guide on the wiki.

[03:26:23] <iqubic> I generated it.
[03:26:41] <iqubic> Scimmia: Is that done by default?
[03:26:44] <Scimmia> no
[03:26:54] <iqubic> Ah.

[03:27:51] <iqubic> Yes, I ran that pacstrap command there.
[03:28:31] <Namarrgon> did you create a separate /boot fs?
[03:29:15] <iqubic> Yes. And it's formatted as fat32
[03:29:32] <Namarrgon> was it mounted before or after you ran that pacstrap command?
[03:29:49] <iqubic> After, I think.
[03:30:18] <Namarrgon> "Create any remaining mount points (such as /mnt/efi) using mkdir(1) and mount their corresponding volumes. "
[03:30:26] <Namarrgon> that comes before the pacstrap step
[03:30:40] <iqubic> Ah. I see. What can I do here?
[03:31:07] <iqubic> I definitely had the root partition mounted before pacstrap.
[03:31:23] <Namarrgon> you mounted the /boot-fs over the kernel, that's why grub-mkconfig couldn't find it

[07:47:37] <iqubic> Alright... so, I can change the PKGBUILD to have a pkgver=4.19.25, and I no longer get 404 errors, but then the SHA256Checksum also needs to change too.
[07:47:37] <ds> iqubic: did you actually get it installed? if not, you can just change the .24 to .25 in the PKGBUILD and it'll work (assuming no other issues)
[07:47:56] <iqubic> I need a new sha256 Hash Checksum.
[07:48:19] <mpan> iqubic: yes. or, if you do it only for yourself, just skip the checksums.

[07:50:34] <iqubic> Yeah. I'm operating on a TOFU principle here: Trust On First Use. I'm trusting the file I've downloaded is correct and that updpkgchecksum is working properly.
[07:50:58] <mpan> TOFU is a security doctrine. Checksum are for random errors in transmission.

[07:51:21] <ds> Very true. In this specific case its quick but meaningless

[12:29:38] <susi> vim in repo is -clipboard, so I have "map <leader>cc :w !xsel -i -b<CR>" in .vimrc, and it kinda works but why it produces this "Press ENTER": https://0x0.st/oKLz.png

[12:32:52] <susi> I'll stick with this, but that "Press ENTER .." is distracting, also that :'<,'w is something I don't understand
[12:33:21] <ds> susi: if you run the command manually (without going through the mapping) is it any different? my guess: you have <CR> which presses enter to *run* the command, but maybe it needs a second <CR> to clear the output
[12:33:46] <ds> ie if you :!ls -l and press enter, it'll show you ls -l output and you press enter a second time to get back into vim

[13:13:19] <ds> heh, seems we were both typing the same thing at the same time, just a different way
[13:13:23] <Erus_Iluvatar> so they removed the "stable" package in favor of the git that is on aur

[17:23:06] <BrainDamage> the error correction can only happen if you have redundancy schemese tho
[17:23:11] <BrainDamage> like raid, etc
[17:23:26] <BrainDamage> by default there's just error detection in form of checksums
[17:23:57] <BrainDamage> it's when you combine the error detection and redundancy that the information is auto-corrected

[17:25:42] <Earnestly> Yes
[17:25:46] <BrainDamage> you have n errors detectable and k errors correctable
[17:25:59] <BrainDamage> with normally k<n

[17:28:32] <Earnestly> Even parchive style usage
[17:28:51] <BrainDamage> I guess it depends on data access frequency
[17:29:04] <BrainDamage> if it's data you access often, it's useless overhead

[17:34:44] <BrainDamage> one way around it might be to allocate the space ala swap file, so that the reliablefs is on a well defined memory region, it remains the risk that the borked framing might write inside this boundary

[20:14:20] <Edu4rdSHL> mpan, we are becoming experts in discovering !notarch :p
[20:14:49] <Edu4rdSHL> Anyways, I still continues using dd to flash ISO to USB device, I should switch

[20:15:35] <red_> you guys cleared my ailment almost immediately
[20:15:42] <red_> I thank you all because I still would have been on a fork
[20:16:01] <red_> the only "issues" I had with archinstall is that the auto partition setup gave me a huge swap file and WEIRD paritions
[20:16:08] <red_> so I'll have to adjust those manually at some point
[20:16:15] <mpan> Edu4rdSHL: it can be used. Just… whyyy? ;_;
[20:17:06] <Edu4rdSHL> red_, installers problems :p, i have never used it, I think that it can be customized...
[20:17:06] <mpan> Even if one uses it in its basic form, which works and doesn’t introduce some placebo flags or coincidenly working operations: the difference between input and output is just 1cm apart on the QWERTY keyboard. ;)
[20:17:35] <red_> Edu4rdSHL: yeah basically if you select "let archinstall decide what's best" it gives you some weird partitions

[20:18:01] <red_> very nice that it was added
[20:18:19] <Edu4rdSHL> mpan, old ways to be honest, I did that my first time, it worked, then I do that every time and it always works :p
[20:18:33] <red_> do you guys think I'll be "gimped" in any way starting off with arch seeing how that most people use ubuntu/debian-based linux
[20:18:42] <red_> like, it's linux but the commands are a bit different
[20:18:46] <Edu4rdSHL> astralc, old memories 
[20:19:06] <red_> or if I know "apt-get" and their variants I should not have a problem using a debian-based system in the future.

[21:14:35] <Antiz> I'm having a "curiosity" question. Dm-crypt/Luks seems to only work with a boot partition mounted to /boot (and not /boot/efi for instance). If your boot partition is anywhere else than /boot you'll get a "no such device" followed by the UUID of your /dev/mapper/crypteddevice and you'll fall under grub-rescue at boot. Does anybody know why it only handle /boot mounted point ?

[21:16:33] <frostschutz> Antiz, grub has very limited support for luks (only luks1 style pbkdf2 keys). most bootloaders don't support encryption at all. so it's common to have unencrypted boot, encrypted everything else

[21:30:58] <Mete-> I have both installed here apparently
[21:31:57] <Antiz> Scimmia: Nah. What I was saying is that when I'm mounting my ESP to /boot/efi like I usually do, I fall under grub rescue at reboot when performing Luks on / (If I don't do Luks, that work)

[21:37:43] <Antiz> astralc: Alright, I think I get it now. So mounting my ESP in /boot works because /boot is readeable by grub (as there's the kernel, its config, etc... It is intended to be read by Grub). But mounting it in /boot/efi (which is recommanded for efi if i'm not wrong) make my ESP go "out" on the /boot that grub can read (even tho it is a parent directory), so when encrypted it cannot read it ?

[21:41:09] <Antiz> But withouth encryption, I've always used /boot/EFI. I've been doing that for years without any problem, before I tried to use Luks :p
[21:41:10] <Namarrgon> grub supports luks v1 and some parts of v2, you're not forced to mount the ESP to /boot

[22:53:15] *** Joins: Szadek (~Szadek@185.254.75.42)
[22:53:22] <remanifest> As I understand it, whether your boot is encrypted or not, your kernel and initramfs could be swapped.
[22:54:01] <tyler> If boot is not encrypted but secure boot is on still possible swap the kernel/initramfs out?
[22:54:31] <remanifest> secure boot would require a new signature upon change
[22:55:06] <remanifest> which is a blessing and a curse (if you don't have a backup and forget to sign a change, sorry bro)

[22:57:57] <tyler> I was starting learning & using Archlinux on June 2020. But still on learning and i do not feel that i should do encryption on any partition. Files are okay but not the whole partiton.

[22:58:49] <remanifest> If your boot is unencrypted, but the rest of your drive is encrypted, and someone swaps the kernel and initramfs without your knowledge, they may be able to perform some malicious actions to compromise confidentiality or integrity further, on your encrypted volume.

[23:07:22] <remanifest> tyler: Ah, confidentiality as a security principle is not a concept that has anything to do with the _value_ of the data itself.
[23:07:56] <remanifest> The value is a function of the degree to which a threat actor may take actions to obtain the data -- but confidentiality is a standalone principle.
[23:08:14] <tyler> I have had trial boot on my old laptop. Win10 Kubuntu and Arch. On my new system i was migrating Arch and Kubuntu. But not Windows  anymore. :)
[23:09:00] <remanifest> astralc: it's a possibility if someone steals the disk, decrypts my macOS install, then re-signs my bootloader from there. Extremely unlikely to occur.
