[16:15:54] <FromGitter> <svenpanne> Things have been fixed on the `helm-flx` side now if I see this correctly, and everybody can safely update Spacemacs and its packages now. But the recipe above (wiping away `~/.emacs.d` and pulling it again from GitHub) would *not* have worked: The problem was not in Spacemacs itself, it was in the combination of packages it was pulling: Some incompatible change in `helm-core` broke `helm-flx`. So when you were 
[16:15:54] <FromGitter> ... unlucky, like a few of us were, you pulled in a broken combination of packages, and you could not even hit `M-x`without an error afterwards. Things like this happen, and it has been fixed quickly. Nevertheless, I'm quite surprised that  such a thing doesn't happen more often...
[16:17:55] <FromGitter> <svenpanne> And regarding Quelpa: I am using Emacs in its various incarnations for roughly 3 decades now, and for me the whole point of Spacemacs is: I don't have to read any documentation at all anymore. (Well, almost.) :-)
