[00:39:39] <Franciman> good luck for this new release, people
[00:40:01] <Franciman> i hope to get back to zig <3 I have been drawn away for the moment
[00:42:11] <ikskuh> Franciman: i hope you had a good time and will return soon!
[00:42:19] <Franciman> it sure was
[00:42:24] <Franciman> I just couldn't understand a few things lol
[00:44:02] <Franciman> for example when passing arguments to functions they are const
[00:44:14] <Franciman> but it also happens when I pass slices
[00:44:20] <Franciman> and pointers to slices, it was kind of strange
[00:44:24] <Franciman> couldn't understand the rules
[00:47:53] <Arnavion> A `[]T` parameter cannot change what it's pointing to, eg it can't be changed to become a subslice of itself, but it can be used to change the Ts themselves

[05:19:55] <ifreund> you could even just make a PR fixing it, or take the lazy approach and hope that someone reading this channel will do so

[13:18:06] <andrewrk> ikskuh, is tvg as a file extension already taken?
[13:18:35] <ikskuh> i have no idea ^^
[13:18:56] <andrewrk> it shouldn't matter in theory, but from a marketing perspective, I suspect TinyVG has a slightly higher chance of adoption if the file extension is .tvg, because 3 letters are more satisfying, especially with the similarity to .svg
[13:19:06] *** Joins: dyeplexer (~dyeplexer@user/dyeplexer)
[13:19:09] <ikskuh> https://www.file-extension.info/format/tvg
[13:19:18] <ikskuh> yeah, the official file extension from my side is tvg
[13:19:51] <andrewrk> fuck 'em. it's your extension now
[13:21:41] <ikskuh> yes!
[13:23:57] <ikskuh> how would you call that part in the specification?
[13:39:07] <andrewrk> ikskuh, you mean the section header in the spec? perhaps a sibling to Format called "Recommended Conventions" and then a simple sentence that says "The canonical file extension of TinyVG is '.tvg'"
[13:39:35] <ikskuh> i've went with "Recognizing TinyVG"
[13:39:43] <ikskuh> TinyVG is using the .tvg file extension and should use the image/x-tinyvg mime type
[13:39:52] <andrewrk> sounds good
[13:40:01] <andrewrk> btw how did you determine the magic bytes to be { 0x72, 0x56 } ?
[13:40:20] <ikskuh> https://www.random.org/cgi-bin/randbyte?nbytes=2&format=h
[13:40:30] <andrewrk> excellent
[13:40:35] <andrewrk> that is professional
[13:40:44] <ikskuh> i figured using anything human decided is likely to collide
[13:40:53] <andrewrk> agreed
[13:41:07] <ikskuh> using random.org helps me to be non-biased and have low collision chance
[13:41:16] <ikskuh> i usually use 4 bytes for magic, but tiny is tiny!

[15:58:41] <earnestly> I'm glad you're making tvg, it looks nice, and I do appreciate the sexprs
[16:00:27] <Piraty> ikskuh: lobste.rs saddens me, usually
[16:00:34] <earnestly> ikskuh: The bit that bothers me is how these new formats cannot be used in browsers in the same way I can use them with my own tools/command-line.  That lack of flexible integration and composition in 'apps' (appliances) means so many of these interesting new formats will probably takes years, if ever, to see
[16:00:46] <ikskuh> Piraty: lobste.rs usually has the better communication style than orange site LOL
[16:01:00] <earnestly> It's better because it's exclusive
[16:01:01] <ikskuh> earnestly: have you seen the wasm polyfill? :)
[16:01:14] <ikskuh> you can easily integrate TinyVG in your website today :)
[16:01:15] <earnestly> ikskuh: No because I don't have javascript enabled
[16:01:18] <ikskuh> ah!
[16:01:58] <earnestly> Which, overall has been a pretty great experience.  Though more websites display nothing, I use that as a signal to suggest the website has nothing to offer
[16:02:55] <ikskuh> i assume that tinyvg.tech should still look brilliant *grin*
[16:02:59] <ikskuh> even if you disable css as well
[16:05:25] <earnestly> ikskuh: Yup, it excellent and to the point which is great as well.  I don't mind CSS and so many interactive features can be described but it now, although I have had to recently disable animations via stylesheets because without javascript websites will display placeholder elements that have a grey/white gradient phasing cylon-eye animation that pegs my CPU usage to 40% or so.
[16:06:00] <ikskuh> haha, yeah
[16:06:01] <earnestly> (Transitions still work just fine and provide the majority of interesting effects anyway)

[19:06:36] <ikskuh> "catch undefined" is a bad idea, this will yield a undefiend value

[19:10:17] <ikskuh> that's right
[19:10:21] <ikskuh> but this is not always true
[19:10:25] <ikskuh> i would go with catch {}
[19:10:31] <ikskuh> it makes this more explicit

[19:11:45] <terminalpusher> but included in the zen is "Only one obvious way to do things." doesn't this violate that?

[23:39:31] <dch> just wrapping up updating zig for 0.9.0 on freebsd, is there a post-build test target I could run?

[23:44:46] <andrewrk> dch, `zig build test-behavior`
[23:44:56] <dch> the naive `./build/zig test build.zig` or ./build/zig test/tests.zig` doesn't find any test cases, but I'm presumably very close
[23:45:20] <andrewrk> `zig build test` if you want the whole test suite. will take a while 
[23:45:48] <dch> thanks andrewrk! I'll run the longer suite overnight
[23:46:28] <andrewrk> dch, that has to be run from within a git source tree; a zig installation does not ship all the test fixtures
[23:46:43] * dch nods
[23:46:50] <andrewrk> s/a git source tree/the zig source tree/
[23:47:18] <dch> this is a final/optional stage in the ports tree build-from-source so we should have all the bits there

[23:56:36] <Daimanta> I have a question about how the compiler works. I often need to join strings with a separator/joiner like ¨ ¨ or ¨, ¨. As would make sense, after the last element you don´t add this separator. What is the best way to implement this(keeping effiency in mind)? I tend to use ´if (i != array.len - 1)´ inside the loop. This keeps code duplication to a minumum but this will enforce n checks for a variable that will be predictably tru
[23:56:36] <Daimanta> e only once. Any pointers?
[23:56:53] <yrashk> I am playing with my own version of a generator primitive, and I am wondering if there's any good way to see if a function call in a frame has ended? Currently I am relying on generator function doing `defer gen.done()` to signal termination: https://gist.github.com/yrashk/95d351163c9f60ed38439a925e40129f#file-generator-zig-L114 -- but I am not very happy about it.

[23:57:53] <andrewrk> Daimanta, it can be situational, but one way that is kind of satisfying is to always append a ", " and then after the loop just chop off the last 2 bytes of the array

[23:58:36] <companion_cube> (this is why formats that accept trailing separators are good)
