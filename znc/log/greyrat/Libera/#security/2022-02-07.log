Once you realise that its not really ever about what it's said to be about and its always raison de'tat

[00:39:24] <zdctg[m]> In AF, we wanted to surrender tactfully and save face and the Taliban set it as a precondition. In UA, we're intent on ensuring that the RF can never pose a credible threat to the US ever again and those or something like those are the real reasons, everything else is just what we say to convince people to go along with us.

[00:43:23] <zdctg[m]> well eastern ukraine has a lot of the functionality that has maintained their nuclear program for some time now, but my suspicion is that its really more about making sure they can never threaten us again more so than whether they pose a credible threat right now-- the fact that they'll tell us to fuck off and stand up to us is more of a problem than whether they can really win or not; just as an aside, Al Qaeda and the Taliban are
[00:43:23] <zdctg[m]> literally luddite cave men and we just lost to them which says something about our actual capability set, if they can pose an actual threat than any organised and motivated entity can.

[00:47:40] <zdctg[m]> doesn't really matter though for my point there though, does it? We spent 20 years trying to defeat them and eventually gave up and surrendered. Even if we consider it as fully and wholly the capability of the Government of Pakistan, then what does that mean? That if a country like Pakistan says no and stands up to us then we lose?

As a result, if you look for consistency in it you won't find any and you'll only see how we contradict ourselves left and right and human rights violations over here are fine but far lesser ones over there are not and so forth--
[00:51:04] <zdctg[m]> but if you look at things purely in terms of raison de'tat (or realpolitik) without the warm fuzzies, then things make a lot more sense.
[00:51:25] <mats1> yes, i get it
[00:51:54] <zdctg[m]> I personally think we're better thought of not as a single government but rather as a collection of governments with no one at all really in control but a bunch of different factions that each have varying control over the whole at different points in time, which is why we're like a schizophrenic superpower.

As such, in *theory* that you can
[02:18:00] <zdctg[m]> decrypt the packets from the AP and they're correct responses is itself a form of authentication. However, is there a way to verify that a given AP is exactly who you expect it to be and not one that overpowered the signal of the expected AP? No, not really, probably at least not without getting out radio equipment and such.

[02:36:26] <austincheney> when I created my certs I created self-signed root certs that I added to the windows trust store for local testing and my certs that I feed to my webserver resolve to my freshly created CA root cert.  Its just weird that the HTTPS server is working correctly but not the WS server using the same certs
[02:36:48] <austincheney> thanks for the screenshot
[02:37:23] <zdctg[m]> I'm not familiar with the nuances of websockets, but there very well may be some sort of extra check made in there somewhere

[02:40:30] <zdctg[m]> its in chrome://flags also, but I would expect that if you added the certificate to the local trust store that it shouldn't be an issue-- but none of this really addresses your question about how to debug whats occurring and the short of it is that I unfortunately do not really have a good answer for you; trial and error and random shit until it works unfortunately

[02:41:04] <zdctg[m]> I hate web development for this reason-- the tools are mostly designed for really high level stuff and then when something breaks at a lower layer there's really no good way of debugging the what and why
[02:42:05] <zdctg[m]> it would be an extra gigantic step involving some superfluous code, but if you get really stuck it might be worthwhile to consider trying to proxy the websocket traffic so that you're basically MiTM'ing it.

[04:04:34] <leonarth> you think VPS providers compile custom kernels w/ backdoor for their access?

[04:16:09] *** Parts: velix (~velix@user/velix) (Leaving)
[04:17:05] <optimant> it's prudent to harden ssh, internet-facing in particular, by having directives like denying root login, requiring use of keys instead of passwords, and keeping current on the sshd version
[04:18:07] <optimant> so what you're looking at suggests, as is common in VPS IP spaces in particular, people are scanning and spraying for common defaults. your auth log (name of it varies by distro) is probably full of failed connections for 'root', 'admin', 'redis', and whatever the flavor of the week becomes
[04:19:05] <optimant> and to what kilitary is saying, if you're worried about the VPS provider getting access to your guest, don't use a VPS. a VPS provider can read memory from the guest and get your credential or data that way. it's unlikely and not what any of the pastes above appear to evidence, in any event.
[04:20:17] <kilitary> and is better to patch sshd so only one user can be online at same time
[04:20:48] <kilitary> if keylogger intercepts your password they will not login in same seconds, you will have some time
[04:21:32] <leonarth> oh that's a nice idea to limit logged users to 1
[04:21:49] <kilitary> at least for same user
[04:22:13] <leonarth> PermitRootLogin no
[04:22:39] <optimant> again, if that is the threat model, a VPS is not right for you IMO. otherwise it's an enjoyable hobby or thought exercise but of little practical import

[09:34:34] <ns12> ajak: One particular concern is with smartphone security, since the OS is not exactly transparent, and there are many third-party apps running on it.
[09:34:51] <labrador> For e-mail it would generally be not open or send html emails. Realize that return to addresses can be spoofed. Even if you think the e-mail is legit always hand type the link and see wether tls is used. And not open attachments unless someone they know explicitly told they were going to send one.

[09:51:15] <labrador> ns12, again the person needs to read and deny said permissions. Using free software might be a good idea too as they usually take lesses perms
[09:51:43] <labrador> For example the system clock might have a lot of access for no reason. But one from f-droid wouldn't use any perms at all

[09:52:43] <ns12> "the person needs to read and deny said permissions" - Many apps don't work without these permissions. In some places, it is not practical to avoid installing banking apps, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, etc.
[09:53:09] <labrador> ns12, then use shelter or android...also tell the person to not use social media
[09:53:19] <labrador> android's workspace feature*
[09:55:21] <ns12> labrador: What is this "Android Workspace"? I couldn't find documentation on it.
[09:56:03] <labrador> ns12, I mean the android work profile feature...use shelter or island app from f-droid. It will create an insulated space(different users,no sharing of files,etc).

[15:12:30] <tk> Assuming I am forced to use LUKSv1 because it's the only thing GRUB supports, are there any advantages on putting /boot on a LUKSv1 partition and putting everything else in a LUKSv2 partition and not just putting EVERYTHING in LUKSv1 (with LVM on top)?
[15:13:33] <tk> Or, alternatively, since the LUKSv2 partition gets decrypted with a large random key stored in the LUKSv1 encrypted /boot, what are the advantages/disadvantages of just putting everything apart from /boot in a LUKS-plain ?
[15:14:40] <tk> To mitigate the fact that LUKSv1 only gives me PBKDF2 and not any of the newer fancier safer high-memory-intensity KDFs I already use a long password

[21:06:20] <austincheney> In NodeJS you can pass in a certificate to a TLS server as a certificate authority.  On Windows it seems browsers only trust CA whose certs are loaded into the Windows Trust store.  Is there any way around this for a self-signed cert for a localhost service?

[21:19:20] <ajak> right
[21:19:28] <ajak> written signatures already have replacements
[21:19:28] <austincheney> ajak, digital signing is where a personal certificate is attached to a document instead of a physical hand written signature.
[21:19:41] *** Joins: tehenderz (~tehenderz@ti0018a400-6632.bb.online.no)
[21:20:22] <austincheney> ajak, the benefits of digital signatures are that you don't have to ever product a printed form of the documentation and everybody can do their signing party entirely online
[21:20:32] <ajak> austincheney: but what about an inline signature? or a gpg signature? or literally just typing "Firstname Lastname" on a pdf form? i'm asking not because i don't know what a digital signature is, but to precisely disambiguate what they mean
[21:21:53] <austincheney> ajak, I only see digital signatures used in the military and mortgage industries.  In the military everybody has personal certificates physically embedded on their military ID cards they can use to sign documents with

[21:22:31] <Thedarkb1-Deskto> topside is correct.
[21:22:39] <ajak> austincheney: so your assumption isn't necessarily accurate, making why i was to disambiguate obvious :p
[21:22:40] <topside> sounds like you want something that enables you to "submit expenses" electronically, and then "approve" them in the same electronic tool... if only something like this already existed
[21:23:11] <austincheney> ajak, i made no assumption
[21:23:17] <topside> but surely paying you to re-invent the wheel is going to be a great use of company resources!
[21:23:26] <Thedarkb1-Deskto> Someone further up the chain wants this done in house, I'm not going to tell them to stop giving me work...
[21:23:46] <austincheney> oh I did make an assumption guessing at their work industry
[21:23:48] <labrador> ajak, a digital signature is a scheme for proving authenticity of messages in a public key cryptosystem?
[21:23:54] <labrador> seems simple
[21:23:58] <topside> tell them you wrote this terrible software package called Concur that you will sell to them for a per-user monthly fee!
[21:24:21] <ajak> labrador: except there's more ways people use that phrase
[21:24:21] <Thedarkb1-Deskto> Apparently they've looked at that, and they've looked at what they'll pay me to implement it, and I'll be cheaper.
[21:24:42] <austincheney> labrador, PKI and digital signatures are different, different crypto algorithms
[21:24:53] <labrador> ajak, stupid people also call copy pasting a normal signature into a pdf a digital signature
[21:24:57] <labrador> Doesn't make it true
[21:25:20] <Thedarkb1-Deskto> I was considering just doing something like a DB with a table for documents, and a table for signatures referencing the document table, with no real security whatsoever, because it's more of a bookkeeping activity than something really open to abuse.
[21:25:22] <labrador> austincheney, signatures need to be in a public key cryptosystem.
[21:25:29] <labrador> What are you talking about?
[21:25:42] <ajak> labrador: are you kidding? you don't get to decide what other people mean when they say things
[21:26:24] <labrador> ajak, lets not remove meaning from digital signatures please
[21:26:33] <labrador> Ignorance doesn't mean something becomes true
[21:26:37] <labrador> If most people do it
[21:26:46] <topside> Thedarkb1-Deskto, I'd stop thinking of it as "signatures" and rephrase as "approvals
[21:26:49] <Thedarkb1-Deskto> Plus, people could probably just bullshit their mileage claims in other ways rather than sending spoof database requests.
[21:26:50] *** ChanServ sets mode: +o ajak

[21:29:20] <ajak> Thedarkb1-Deskto: right, so signing doesn't matter a ton in the first place
