[01:51:59] <TML> judah: I _operate_ an MSP, and we're not having trouble getting clients; but we definitely do not restrict ourselves to "local".
[01:52:47] <judah> Yeah its the strangest thing. Had a bunch of people all say they were interested and would sign on. Now that the business is open, suddenly everyone disappeared
[01:54:00] <judah> Might just be me though. I am trying to save up to hire a sales guy. Only catch there is the cheap ones dont get results.
[01:54:14] <judah> and the expensive ones are already employed :P

[02:10:23] <ordos> judah, one of our subsidiaries has been running an MSP operation for ~16 years, these days very successful (local market leader), and it was started by one guy. He often gives talks at local entrepreneurship club events (these are quite frequent on the African continent). Anyway he's always babbling on to new and young entrepreneurs that when he started out, he built his reputation (and by extension, demand for his company's services) by doing work for free.
[02:10:24] <ordos> Basically he landed a deal with a local hardware distributor (Indian company called Sahara Computers) and then he proceeded to use each client's purchase account to buy their equipment at cost, and he'd eat and sleep on the company's premises to get by on rent, food, and basic sanitary requirements. It sounds crazy but you must understand the early 2000s tech wave in the context of African frugality. Anyway, this guy has done pretty well for himself. I think one
[02:10:24] <ordos> trick you could try to grow your new MSP business is to do some jobs for free. Depending on your existing experience level you could strategically target a company where a successful MSP implementation will get you all the right attention. Good luck. Entrepreneurship is hard. And unless you can PHP.stringify() this it's also off-topic. But check out PHP's social channel.
[02:11:56] * ordos recalls a cool story about TML's government contract, and the purposely infrequent albeit meticulously executed air-gapped upgrade cycle.
[02:12:51] <judah> I appreciate the insight ordos. Figured I would ask here since this is the right kind of crowd, but it is definitely off topic
[02:13:05] <TML> judah: It's probably a bit more close to on-topic in #phpc
[02:13:21] <judah> oh hey, a new channel to join :D
[02:13:31] <ordos> Yeah I'll join you.

[21:33:38] <da_wunder> Thanatermesis: yep, you should provide some example about your error - eg. share that code in gist.github.com or create example about your error to 3v4l.org site
[21:34:37] <Thanatermesis> its fine now, thanks, i just wanted to know what is the correct way to evaluate booleans true / false but the issue was more like i didn't had it predefined at the top of the function
[21:35:30] <da_wunder> and that we should seen quite fast - if you shared your code with us
[21:35:48] <da_wunder> or even propose better solution
[21:35:49] <__adrian> Thanatermesis: understood - but the way you're phrasing that makes is think you don't have the solution you think you do. if you'd like to provide an example, we could confirm. otherwise, glad to hear you've got it
[21:36:02] <__adrian> *us think
[21:38:02] <Thanatermesis> well yeah, the problem is that I was having these messages "PHP Notify: Undefined variable" no matter which way i evaluated the boolean variable (but so, the solution was to actually pre-set the variable to false)
[21:39:38] <da_wunder> I think that __adrian explained that problem with example

[22:18:26] <znf> Is there a way to get a more meaningful error message from get_headers() other than "failed to open stream: HTTP request failed!"?
[22:21:54] <__adrian> guzzle
[22:22:33] <da_wunder> or symfony/httpclient
[22:23:24] <znf> sadly not an option, freakin' wordpress
[22:25:57] <Albright> Try #wordpress then. I would be very surprised if whatever HTTP client they have doesn't have a method to get more detailed error information.
[22:26:16] <Albright> Most likely they're wrapping cURL and cURL itself does provide that info.

[22:53:46] <puff> znf: Where are you getting the error?
[22:54:07] <puff> znf: That is, is it your php script doing an HTTP request on the backend, or what?
[22:54:45] <znf> Albright, nah, this is a a plugin that calls get_headers() directly, I wanted to see if I could just patch it to somehow show more meaningful messages
[22:55:05] <znf> puff, it's a 3rd party plugin for AMP
[22:55:21] <puff> Aha.
[22:55:44] <znf> sometimes it starts crawling pages (why?!) and it start throwing dozens of "failed to open stream" messages in error_log
[22:55:46] <puff> znf: That doesnt' really answer my question.
[22:55:57] <znf> I feel like it does :)
[22:57:03] <puff> znf: Nope.
[22:57:17] <znf> I don't know which part you didn't understand
[22:57:38] <puff> znf: The answer to my question appears to be yes.
[22:57:53] <puff> znf: So what's most likely is that you don't have allow_url_fopen set to true or whatever.
[22:58:13] <znf> I don't have that disabled.
[22:58:18] *** Joins: funhouse (~funhouse@user/funhouse)
[22:58:41] <puff> Okay, second possibility, the server might be dropping the request before sending back a response.  What's user_agent set to on your request?
[22:59:05] <znf> ...hence why I want to know what it's getting :)
[22:59:19] <puff> "failed to open stream" means that the the stream isn't there, which most likely means that the server closed the connection.
[22:59:37] <puff> Or that the connection wasn't opened to begin with, but I believe that gives you a different error.
[22:59:44] <znf> it's using no user-agent, just '-'
[22:59:55] <znf> I'm looking at access log, it crawls then it suddenly... doesn't  :)
[23:00:11] <znf> but I also see no error in the webserver log
[23:00:35] <puff> Try setting it to a popular user agent.
[23:00:52] <puff> A google result suggests:  ini_set('user_agent', 'Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.0.16) Gecko/2009121601 Ubuntu/9.04 (jaunty) Firefox/3.0.16');
[23:01:07] <puff> Also, try just curling that URL from the command line and see what happens.
[23:01:33] <znf> the URL works just fine
[23:01:52] <puff> Based on what?
[23:02:00] <znf> based on me curl-ing the url from the local host
[23:02:42] <znf> I've already been trough all checks server-side, else I wouldn't resort to asking if I can get a more meaningful message from that
[23:02:58] <puff> Okay, so you *did* curl test, good.
[23:03:09] <puff> Did you try setting the user agent?
[23:03:15] <znf> I don't want to set a user agent
[23:03:20] <znf> besides, I can not reproduce it
[23:03:23] <znf> hence...
[23:03:44] <znf> if I could have reproduced it whenever I wanted to, I would have checked all that already :)
[23:04:11] <puff> Ah, wait, so it's not failing on the same URL every time?
[23:04:15] <znf> no
[23:04:26] <puff> Might be some sort of resource limit on your hosting.
[23:04:26] <znf> I was hoping to add some way to debug whatever get_headers() is getting from the server so when it happens again I can get a meaningful message
[23:04:43] <znf> I am my hosting, and the account in case is never reaching it's own resource limit
[23:06:01] <puff> Yeah, I don't see any way to get more debug info, but I'm no php guru.  Might try changing your script to use curl instead, that might have better options for more debug info.
[23:06:03] <puff> Are all the URLs on the same server?
[23:06:25] <znf> Yes
[23:06:38] <znf> the plugin is just crawling "itself" for... reasons I can not comprehend
[23:06:50] <puff> Oooookay.
[23:06:53] <znf> as in, it's crawling it's own generated URLs
[23:06:59] <znf> ie: domain/amp/page/XXX
[23:07:07] <puff> Aha, okay.
[23:07:09] <puff> Interesting.
[23:07:12] <puff> I wonder why.
[23:07:48] <znf> dunno, I just told the user to disable that function for the time being
[23:09:09] <puff> This is an SEO plugin, right?  Maybe it's just checking to make sure that the generated pages load.
[23:11:09] <znf> it's loading, not a SEO, it's just generating the AMP version of pages
[23:11:56] <puff> Ah, mobile.
[23:12:13] <puff> Still, same point, maybe it's just confirming that the generated pages load.
