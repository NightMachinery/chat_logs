[00:00:25] <user51> why?
[00:00:37] * vdamewood gawks at apotheon
[00:00:42] <apotheon> That's a great way to destroy portability, and without portability there's little reason to use a language that's part of the standard Unixy toolkit.
[00:00:43] <droid3> But when you dont use mpmath and just do 2**2.123 say how do you set the precision as it only shows about 20 to 50 digits
[00:00:55] <nomagno> I mean, I am definitely a proponent of POSIX/Bourne shell for anything that isn't a one-liner
[00:01:01] <apotheon> might as well just install an interpreter or compiler for something else
[00:01:03] <nomagno> Not that you can't do more complicated stuff with awk
[00:01:10] <nomagno> it just isn't designed for it
[00:01:43] <droid3> Another words how do you control precision when your not dealing with mpmath lib never really had to deal with this as python seems to do it all behind the scene keeping track of everything but how does one display more digits

[00:01:48] <user51> i was specifically interested in multidimensional arrays, switch(), and function pointers
[00:01:50] <nomagno> Some Perl people, even nowadays, still have the position "If it takes more than one line in POSIX shell, use Perl!". Similarly, you will find awk proponents that say the same about sed
[00:01:59] <nomagno> So I guess this is just Unix idiosyncrasy
[00:02:04] <apotheon> The main purpose for awk as a programming language, in my estimation, is to combine it with sh to get a better language than Bash for scripting.

[00:02:15] <droid3> These are kind of cheese question but there ones i am a bit curious of today.
[00:02:33] <nomagno> The term bash is a bash-ism. Please avoid
[00:03:21] <user51> i do wonder if it's possible to add some gawk features to nawk
[00:03:32] <apotheon> user51: Neither awk nor Python has pointers.
[00:03:37] <user51> although it would probably involve an interpreter of some sort
[00:03:43] <apotheon> I don't think either of them even has explicit references.
[00:03:49] * vdamewood shawks apotheon with a lightning bolt
[00:03:57] <nomagno> user51: awk has the concept of functions, so definitely some features can be added. Others, not so much
[00:04:25] <apotheon> nomagno: Actually, even for one-liners awk is often more succinct and clear than sed.
[00:04:51] <nomagno> Awk is definitely one of the simplests possible language you can write that still gets away with justifying subroutines
[00:04:55] <droid3> basically i am curious when python will display how much digits a precision out to the screen? If i do say 242**4423 i get it spitting out tons of digits but if i do 2.3**2.1 i only get it spitting out say around 10 to 15 digits?
[00:04:55] <apotheon> Single-operation scripts are basically the sweet spot for sed.
[00:04:58] <droid3> WTF
[00:05:35] <droid3> this is independent of what i set the getcontext().prec = to ?
[00:05:36] <nomagno> One thing is true, sh SUCKS for math
[00:05:43] <nomagno> That's the main purpose of all these other commands, really
[00:06:07] <droid3> i can get around all this by using /importing mpmath 
[00:06:29] <pyzozord> would it be difficult to write an awk html parser that converts it to just plain text?
[00:06:35] <droid3> But the built-in ** seems to allow for raising decimal numbers to decimal powers
[00:06:37] <user51> apotheon: i once tried a horrible attempt at getting lists in nawk
[00:06:42] <pyzozord> or maybe to .groff
[00:07:03] <pyzozord> I'd use that script with wget as my main browser
[00:07:09] <droid3> The issue is it seems to round decimal powers but keep integer powers exact aka displays them exact
[00:07:13] <nomagno> pyzozord: I argue it would be fairly painful
[00:07:25] <pyzozord> to use or to write?
[00:07:33] <nomagno> To write
[00:07:40] <droid3> So i kind of need a way to control how much precision the built in operators like ** , / ,...etc have
[00:07:51] <pyzozord> yeah probably
[00:07:58] <nomagno> If you settle on an HTML subset, that's another story
[00:08:12] <droid3> Is there away of controlling this or is it internal to python and the only way to do it is going thru mpmath or other addon arbitrary precision libraries???
[00:09:06] <apotheon> nomagno: You just have to use the correct "function" in sh, e.g. bc(1).
[00:09:26] <apotheon> 20:36 < pyzozord> would it be difficult to write an awk html parser that converts it to just plain text?
[00:09:34] <apotheon> It'd be easier in awk than many programming languages.
[00:09:46] <nomagno> Why do people reference commands by their manpage category so often?
[00:09:47] <dan01[m]> Stupid question but

[00:53:04] <apotheon> Guest39: Lacking evidence to the contrary, the fact the code on GitHub was posted before any provable date of your possession of it constitutes "proof" in court that you infringed copyright, generally speaking, in the US and nations with similar court systems.
[00:53:07] <Guest39> apotheon easy - a company employee will say he wrote it
[00:53:19] <apotheon> IANAL.  This is not legal advice.  I will laugh at you if you try to sue me for saying this.
[00:54:04] <flakland> is that not fraud?
[00:54:23] <apotheon> The point is . . . you can easily get your ass sued over copying code from GitHub.
[00:54:48] <Guest39> so for people who want their code to be used freely  you advice to add license that says it is free to use?
[00:55:04] <Guest39> another option - add no license and do not sue people who use code :)
[00:55:20] <Raziel> no man's code
[00:55:22] <apotheon> I mean, honestly, there's effectively *no such thing* as ironclad proof in the real world that someone was the first person to write a particular snippet of code, but courts don't care about that.
[00:55:36] <Raziel> this code came out of the void. no one knows who wrote it or when. it just showed up.

[01:08:30] <apotheon> Going to college for it is probably only cost effective if your goal is a degree.

[01:09:26] <makersmasher> well something like "The algorithm design manual" I ahve a tough time following, and I assume it's due to the lack of math background

[01:10:16] <apotheon> Often, a college course's most valuable resource as a way to learn is its syllabus.  Some people also find value in deadlines.  Beyond that, there's rarely much value in the actual classroom mechanisms, because of how most people "teach" in that setting.

[01:13:21] <Raziel> :p
[01:13:40] <apotheon> Copyright is an insidious and pervasive reversal of a sane treatment of the idea of how ideas and their expressions actually work in a "state of nature" (for lack of a better term), and undoing the tangled perverse incentives of it is kinda hard, really.
[01:13:56] <nomagno> tomathy: Well you took the cat and the brush, and neither of those have rights in this context. You are definitely the copyright holder of that painting
[01:14:30] <tomathy> the problem with copyright is that if you distribute your idea/work then you inflict harm on everyone who might have invented it themselves
[01:14:33] <apotheon> tomathy: Trying to restrict others' use of that method of creating art would be a matter of patent law, not copyright law.
[01:14:42] <apotheon> It's a separate body of "intellectual property" law.

[05:47:35] <flakland> going to have to be more specific
[05:49:11] <Satin> Well so I have a very basic C program that parses JSON entries using JSON-C library, it's supposed to be a simple booktracker excercise. I also wanted to try making a GUI for it, so I'm trying to use GTK. I've learnt a little bit about widgets and trying to display buttons onto the screen, but I'm unsure of what sort of what approach I should use to convert each json entry to display it in a GUI using GTK.

[05:51:53] <Satin> Which, (and I admit I might just not be looking hard enough) has been harder than expected. GTK examples seem not that common or something like that, though there are a few useful tutorials.
[05:52:29] <Satin> And sometimes when there are on stackexchange or such, they're not relevant to what I'm trying to do, and then ontop of that GTK4 is different in a bunch of ways from previous versions apparently? 
[05:52:48] <Satin> (so even stuff like how you handle windows and gtk_init () at the start isn't the same as before apparently.)
[05:53:01] <flakland> gtk reinvents itself often it seems
[05:53:28] <Satin> Yeah, reading. https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/migrating-3to4.html gives that idea as well

[05:54:51] <Satin> But returning back to my question, at the least conceptually, is there any common-sense approach that I'm missing here?

[06:49:47] <oldlaptop> There has been some work in that respect. Static analysis - compiler warnings are an example, and there have also been dedicated tools for a long time - is also used, as are "fuzzers" (which supply the program under test with vast quantities of random garbage input in an attempt to make it do "interesting" things)
[06:50:29] <kek_> ok thanks gonna google a bit, might come back :P
[06:50:45] <[itchyjunk]> I don't think statistical models helps too much with vuln finding in general
[06:50:49] <oldlaptop> usually a good fuzzer (afl is an example) will also instrument the program under test to see which codepaths it takes, and will mutate the random garbage input in a guided fashion to make it visit as many paths as possible

[07:31:45] <apotheon> Ox151: It depends on the project.  Sometimes people add license text to a source file header comment, and sometimes it's a separate file so that you'd need to find a way to insert the license text somewhere yourself.  When you use a license file, it's a good idea to include a note in it about components borrowed from elsewhere that use different licenses.

[13:16:41] <alycidyne> Hello, in the assignment `z = x*y` in a language with overloading and where z: int, isn't the type checking here mostly just finding `*`, `x` and `y` such that the RHS has type int, i.e. type inhabitation? I'm now seriously confused as to the difference between type checking and type inhabitation

[14:32:31] <bjs> dan01[m]: 'a' encoded in ASCII is 0x61,  'b' is 0x62 etc
[14:33:13] <dan01[m]> Well ok, thanks! I didn't get where you mentioned that before, but now I'm confused, because the docs say:
[14:33:13] <dan01[m]> The source character set is defined by the encoding declaration; it is UTF-8 if no encoding declaration is given in the source file; see section Encoding
[14:34:11] <dan01[m]> But I know you're right, 'case then it says:
[14:34:11] <dan01[m]> They may only contain ASCII characters; bytes with a numeric value of 128 or greater must be expressed with escapes.
[14:35:07] <bjs> dan01[m]: yes the source is in UTF-8,  when you decode you get text, the text includes Python code like a byte literal, and then you take the literal and encode it as ASCII

[16:26:32] <bud> lind{at}yahoo: yes, that is important. i was more thinking that in some cases you might want to exit with one error code for "wrong user input" (pw/username), and another if f.i. the program getting executed fails.
[16:27:33] <bud> but use exit 1 99.99% of the times.
[16:27:39] <bud> exit codes are quite annoying.
[16:27:51] <lind{at}yahoo> yes, you want to differentiate between types of favor, but in general there should be only one exit for an authentication. You can internally, and securely, log the differentiations but not expose it to outside systems or the user.
[16:28:01] <lind{at}yahoo> favor = behavior
[16:28:20] <arash> Hello, I know a few language like PHP, I need some advice about learning new things. I'm always in hurry to learn new things and my excitement slow down my progress, also must of the time I don't know how to learn new things?
[16:28:49] <bud> i writ quite a lot of shell scripts. and i found a neat trick to do an escalated exit out of nested subshells by using a "custom" exit code.
[16:29:10] <lind{at}yahoo> as I said it was a general comment, I didn't really read exactly what you were doing: just dealing with a security pain point that many security architects fail to address. There are many major platforms that will tell you if your account exists or not according to an email address or phone number

[16:29:48] <bud> however if an external program uses that exit code, it will do the exit escalation. some programs use exit code != 0 for things that aren't really a failure (curl f.i)

[22:57:32] <user51> nomagno: does doom apply? :P
[22:58:10] <user51> i'd argue that feature creep is also very easy to get if you write your program just right
[22:58:57] <nomagno> I have this obsessive tendency to both refactor code until it is fully simplified by my current abilities, and increase the scope creep of a project until it is not sustainable
[22:59:10] <user51> pyzozord: you could use math. or even cooking. but sometimes it all feels like the same crap: you break stuff down and feel, meh, i've seen this before
[22:59:23] <kveroneau> Feature creep isn't all bad imo, it's how a game will naturally evolve from it's initial concepts to something much better, as new ideas are brought in.
