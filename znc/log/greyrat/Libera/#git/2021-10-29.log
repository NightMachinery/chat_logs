[00:10:11] <imMute> yeah, just delete the "features/59108-klarity-service" branch in ADO.
[00:10:35] <imMute> if you look at PR #1682 in ADO, it'll tell you which branch was the source branch.  Double check that it was "features/59108-klarity-service" before you delete that branch

[01:22:19] <ForeverNoob[m]> hello, on a new machine where I want to pull in new / other branches, I thought I could just do `git pull --all` but apparently I have to do `git pull origin bug/accidental_P=NP` why is that?

[01:27:17] <ForeverNoob[m]> with `pull --all` I wanted to have pretty much exact copy of the repo I did `git push --all` in, so all the branches (and also submodules?)
[01:28:19] <anddam> ForeverNoob[m]: so kinda what I was just asking about
[01:29:11] <anddam> I got suggested this nice brain-teaser "git fetch origin +refs/heads/branch:refs/heads/branch +refs/heads/other_branch:refs/heads/other_branch"
[01:29:46] <anddam> and it does work, not sure it's better or worse than many tinier commands
[01:30:02] <anddam> ForeverNoob[m]: but your pull would be different, since it would be a merge
[01:30:16] <anddam> this one resets local branches to remotes, all at once

[01:37:39] <osse> I don't know what your case is
[01:37:52] <anddam> osse: I mean the messing with refspec thingies part, I am not sure if that's referred to what I am doing with that fetch command of mine
[01:38:38] <anddam> osse: pretty easy, I have a develop machine and a few build machines where I update the branches and manually (for now) start the builds
[01:38:43] <osse> Hmm, I'm not sure either. I just started babbling. Probably shouldn't have done that
[01:38:56] <anddam> osse: oh no, you are in it now…
[01:39:30] <anddam> but I just need a hint, since I am going to sleep in minutes
[01:39:47] <anddam> osse: do you think that is somehow bad?
[01:40:05] <osse> No
[01:40:08] <anddam> (that the fetch command, not going to sleep, the latter is actually beneficiary)
[01:40:22] <osse> It just seems more complicated than it needs to be, for not much gain
[01:40:33] <anddam> osse: I am all ears for a simpler way
[01:40:42] <osse> "git fetch"
[01:41:23] <anddam> ok, but then branch foo stays where it is, rather than being moved to origin/foo
[01:41:40] <anddam> but I'll concede "git fetch" is easier
[01:42:24] <ForeverNoob[m]> anddam: I think your answer is more than I bargained for :p
[01:42:47] <ForeverNoob[m]> origin is the remote repo in this context which is the most "up to date", correct?
[01:43:08] <osse> anddam: then I'd do a git reset origin/foo afterwards. (Don't you have to do that anyway? git fetch won't change any actual files on disk)

[01:46:25] <osse> Imho keep the number of local branches low. Only the one(s) you actually work on
[01:46:37] <osse> There's no need in having a foo for every origin/foo
[01:47:14] <anddam> I (try to) follow "oneflow"
[01:47:19] <anddam> at least it made sense when I read it
[01:47:40] <ForeverNoob[m]> osse: that advice makes sense, but what if you still want to have all branches?
[01:47:41] <anddam> I have a master to make code changes, then a few release-this and release-that for customizations
[01:47:59] <anddam> osse: it's the release-* that I have to reset and build, I could automate this with a script

[01:48:59] <osse> ForeverNoob[m]: First I'd say "you already have them, just look at git branch -r" and then you'd say "no I mean I want real local branches like with 'git branch'" and then I'd say "jebus, I dunno. I mean you could script it, but bleh"
[01:49:36] <anddam> ForeverNoob[m]: that is actually ikke's
[01:49:37] <osse> then I'd follow up with "ah, yeah, you can (ab)use git fetch for this purpose"

[11:02:48] <dminuoso> I have 4 submodules, but git status says `modified:   plugins/nako (modified content, untracked content)` for each. Im a bit unsure what git is trying to tell me here.

[13:30:26] <SadEnding> Can anyone help me understand what I'm doing wrong with line endings? I have a repo where I've added some csv files, but I now want to standardise them as having CRLF line endings. I've added a .gitattributes file with "* text=auto" and "*.csv text eol=crlf", and when I run git ls-files --eol I get "i/lf    w/lf    attr/text eol=crlf". However,
[13:30:27] <SadEnding> when I run file filename.csv it still has \n endings, and doing git add . --renormalize as some on the internet seem to suggest does nothing :(

[13:39:20] <canton7> SadEnding, ls-files tells you that the file currently has lf line endings. 'text eol=crlf' in your .gitattributes tells git that the file should have LF line endings in the repository, but should be converted to CRLF on checkout. The important bit is "on checkout" if the files haven't been checked out of the repo since that setting was added,
[13:39:20] <canton7> checkout won't have changed the line endings
[13:40:19] <canton7> SadEnding, so, you need to check them out of the repo again (assuming they're already properly committed). 'git checkout -- path/to/file.csv' or similar might do it, or you might need to delete first, not sure.
[13:41:52] <canton7> (git add . --renormalize is going the opposite way: when your file is checked into the repo with the wrong line endings (and the line endings are right in your working directory), so you want to check them in again
[13:44:58] <SadEnding> canton7 thank you for the answer! That makes sense - deleting then checking out again sorted things.

[22:56:13] <velix> ikke: So when accept a PR, it's rebased?
[22:56:27] <ikke> There is a rebase button
[22:56:45] <ikke> but when you have multiple MRs, you need to rebase one by one

[22:56:48] <elibrokeit> imMute: set remote.origin.pushurl twice (remote set-url --add) and one remote will push to two urls. It's handy for mirroring
[22:57:12] <ikke> also, skip CI on rebase

[22:57:55] <elibrokeit> Isn't marge-bot already automatic rebase+merge?
[22:58:10] <elibrokeit> Why do you not want to run CI on it though
[22:58:38] <ikke> For the project that I need it for, the chance that something breaks due to rebasing is very small
[22:58:53] <ikke> but pipelines can take quite some time

[22:59:40] <elibrokeit> In that case shouldn't it be sufficient to just merge the MR, which IIRC can be defaulted to "merge via rebase" just like GitHub?

[23:00:43] <ikke> You first rebase, and then after the rebase is finished, you can choose to merge when CI completes, or merge immediately (but CI still continues)

[23:03:10] <elibrokeit> (I am such an infrequent gitlab user)
[23:03:24] <elibrokeit> Let's all go back to mailing lists.

[23:24:26] <velix> I'm just testing, how good it integrates with GitKraken.
[23:24:46] <velix> What I like about Gitlab: you can set references to issues and commits in the Wiki.
[23:24:50] <velix> You can't do this on Github.
[23:25:17] <velix> In Github, you're getting normal links only.
[23:25:54] <velix> Oh. Gitlab "groups" aren't recognized as Team in Gitkraken as it seems :(
