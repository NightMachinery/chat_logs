[02:28:03] <tp43_> https://downloads.sierrawireless.com/tools/leaf/leaf_latest.deb this is it. It installs np, but when you run it to install the embed system dev tools, it breaks. Anyone can bother, after installing, try to do $leaf setup wp76stable -p swi-wp76_5.0.0
[02:29:02] <somiaj> !pciid
[02:29:02] <dpkg> The PCI ID helps us work out how to support your PCI hardware.  It looks like [abcd:1234] in the output of "lspci -nn".  Ask the bot "judd" to match the PCI ID of the device, e.g. "/msg judd pciid 8086:284b".  Some hardware uses alternate means of detection: beware of some false positives+negatives.  See also <judd-hardware>, <local pciid>.  To find out what currently installed kernel modules your hardware is using, run "lspci -k".
[02:29:27] <somiaj> asarch: I forget what site judd uses, but I think more and more it is becoming a bit less accurate/false negatives

[04:23:17] <SymbioticFemale> ...then what?
[04:31:33] <somiaj> SymbioticFemale: It really depends on what you installed and what depends got brought in. First what version of debian do you run?
[04:32:09] <SymbioticFemale> its bullseye but there are about 40 packages or more that came from experimental due to a config issue
[04:32:52] <somiaj> !partial downgrade
[04:32:53] <dpkg> This may or may not work for you, but if you've got nothing to lose then try it: (a) change sources.list (b) aptitude update (c) aptitude and then search for the upgraded packages, hit enter on them, select the correct version (d) do the same for libc6 (e) search for broken packages by pressing "b" and then fix them in the same way (f) once you have no more broken packages, hit 'g'.  See <not available>.
[04:32:54] <SymbioticFemale> seems like i can "apt install <package>/bullseye, but is there a way to do this to all packages at once without having to manually specify them all?
[04:33:02] <somiaj> you can try that
[04:33:06] <somiaj> !not available
[04:33:06] <dpkg> To get a list of packages you have installed now, that are not available from any repository in your sources.list: aptitude search '?narrow(?not(?archive("^[^n][^o].*$")),?version(CURRENT))'
[04:33:13] <somiaj> That is useful to get a list of which packages you need to fix
[04:33:20] <SymbioticFemale> ok
[04:33:31] <somiaj> there really isn't any good way, as downgrading is not supported. Manually doing it is often better but you can try other methods

When I want to test and see localhost, I get redirectet to https://localhost/ and get "Not found". I assume there is a redirect in the snap. Any idea how i can bypass it?

[11:51:03] <PMT> ah, no, you didn't ask for the live version. oh well.
[11:51:04] <jelly> is sudorm looking for live image or installer image?
[11:51:15] <mathew> https://paste.debian.net/1213830/
[11:51:37] <jelly> mathew, that's for port 8080
[11:51:47] <sudorm> PMT, jelly, i still have a ISO named debian-10.4.0-amd64-xfce-CD-1.iso  which is < 700 MB
[11:52:06] <jelly> mathew, you said you were unsure about port 80 and what's doing the redirection there
[11:52:06] <sudorm> this means that, there was a CD version full install, *not netinst*
[11:52:14] <sudorm> which fitted in 700 MB
[11:52:53] <PMT> sudorm: great, so use the buster cd you already have and love. what's the problem?
[11:52:55] <jelly> sudorm, okay, that's still the installer

[11:53:27] <jelly> and a rather old buster image, 10.10 should be the la(te)st
[11:53:43] <sudorm> PMT, haha yeah that's a solution :) my question is: are there still distributions iso  -xfce-CD-1.iso ?
[11:53:51] <mathew> yes. the snap runs on port 8080+8443. this does the redirect, maybe because of https enable. i habe a new apache on 80 without ssl. what i want to do is look up localhost:80 in browser but i get rediret to https://localhost/ for some reason
[11:54:00] <sudorm> i.e. non netinst, full install which fits in a CD size?
[11:54:32] <jelly> mathew, if you open http://localhost/ without a port specified, you get the web server running on port 80.
[11:55:05] <jelly> mathew, if you open http://localhost:8080/ THEN you get results from the web server listening on port 8080
[11:55:09] <mathew> unfortunally not. i connect via a second computer bc the server has not browser installed

[12:02:34] <mathew> to be honest
[12:03:02] <PMT> sudorm: I have no particular idea. I don't see anything obvious in the release notes for bullseye about it. You could try asking #debian on OFTC. I would suspect they found the usage numbers on those images so low they weren't particularly worth making, but that's just a blind guess.
[12:04:09] <jelly> mathew, okay, one more thing.  Install curl on server, try to access web server like this: curl -vL http://localhost/
[12:04:20] <PMT> There's also #debian-cd in particular on OFTC.
[12:04:38] <sudorm> PMT, thanks! I'll have a look
[12:04:43] <sudorm> is OFTC another IRC?
[12:04:47] <jelly> mathew, do you still see the https redirect there?  Does something related appear in apache logs?
[12:05:00] <jelly> keep tail -F running in a second terminal
[12:05:29] <PMT> sudorm: it's another IRC network, yes. I'd be curious if you'd share if you do find the answer.
[12:05:38] <Haohmaru> sudorm yes, OFTC is another irc network
[12:05:47] <jelly> if you can reach apache on port 80 using http://localhost/ but not over the network, it's likely something is doing port translation

[13:20:42] <jelly> Bushmaster, let me see if I understand your needs correctly: you have 7 linux ssh servers inside a private LAN; you want to be able to connect to each of them from inside that LAN, but also from outside.  You have a router that can expose ports by doing NAT.  Is that roughly correct?
[13:21:23] <jelly> zaggynl, gwith public cloud infra, jump hosts are used more often than properly set-up vpn servers :-\

[13:29:02] <Bushmaster> jelly,  don't understood everything you typed, but yeah I have 7 Linux Servers, most of them are Debian 9 and 10 and one of them is Mint, I can access files from Nemo from any of these servers by typing internal Ip address for example 192.168.1.14 and then username and password, it has never been a problem
[13:29:31] <Bushmaster> however, the problem is I have only one external IP, which lets say is dynamic in nature anyway but it has DNS as well
[13:29:46] <Bushmaster> and I have opened port 22 for all servers
[13:30:14] <Bushmaster> so when I try to access my servers sitting 100 miles away from servers home, i can only access one Debian 9 server
[13:30:38] <Bushmaster> so my inquiry is why it is not allowing me to access other 6 servers even though ports are open for them
[13:30:58] <PMT> Bushmaster: Your options are NAT and port forwarding, or a VPN.

[14:15:55] <BCMM> no
[14:16:00] <BCMM> a) you expose a single server to the internet. you ssh to that server and then ssh *from* that server to one of the other servers

[14:16:34] <BCMM> b) you expose all the servers to the internet and then connect to whichever one you want directly

[14:17:22] <Bushmaster> well a or b, none of them work, it half works cos with domain name address I can only access one server from Winscp

[14:20:27] <BCMM> you need to, somehow, actually tell it which server it is supposed to connect to
[14:20:57] <BCMM> if you've gone with route b) so far, that's done by telling winscp to connect to a different port

[15:12:19] <randall> Bushmaster: GPT is a partition table type, it's not a program that prevents you doing something.
[15:12:48] <BCMM> Bushmaster: GPT is just the modern replacement for the MBR. if you "remove" the GPT, you have what is effectively a blank, unpartitioned hard drive

[16:07:05] <willow> Bushmaster: don't call it BIOS.  computers do not have BIOS anymore.  They have firmare called EFI which can emulate BIOS

[19:04:43] <jelly> andyjpb, you likely told it not to install that particular CA cert when it first appeared and it asked
[19:05:02] <andyjpb> ah yes. perhaps during an upgrade I didn't want to review anything.
[19:05:04] <andyjpb> can I do it now?
[19:05:35] <jelly> yes, if you keep ask, next screen gives you a list of certs
[19:05:37] <andyjpb> ah.. If I go to the next screen in the reconfigure I can select the ones I trust

[19:05:53] <andyjpb> what's the defaults? there are a lot here that aren't selected
[19:05:58] <andyjpb> is the default to have all of them?
[19:06:13] <jelly> you probably want to trust all the certs that come from mozilla/
[19:06:33] <jelly> that's what firefox does by default
[19:06:37] <andyjpb> I only have ones from mozilla in the list
[19:06:41] <jelly> indeed :-)
[19:08:24] <andyjpb> out of ~130 only ~48 are currently selected

[20:04:56] <brentaarnold> I'm trying to install Debian on a Dell OptiPlex 7040 that has a 256GB M.2. The M.2 cannot be recognized by the installation media when using UEFI. When I switch back to Legacy boot the installation media recognizes the drive. I used GParted to delete the partitions on the drive, now I'm booted back into the installation media and the M.2 still will not be recognized by it.
[20:05:25] <brentaarnold> Any ideas?
[20:07:26] <andyjpb> does it show up as an nvme device rather than an sd* when the mode changes?
[20:07:28] <brentaarnold> I should also state that now I'm back in UEFI mode, and got a notification that it thinks it sees a previously installed Legacy system and if I proceed I could have trouble accessing it. I chose to go ahead and force it since there's nothing on the drive anyways.
[20:07:38] <brentaarnold> andyjpb: Yes it does.
[20:08:23] <andyjpb> but you don't see it in dmesg in uefi mode?
[20:08:44] <brentaarnold> Not sure what dmesg is
[20:08:51] <brentaarnold> I'm a little new
[20:09:18] <andyjpb> it's the stuff the kernel prints out as it boots. you can see it again by running `dmesg` (perhaps as root, depending on kernel and perms)
[20:10:00] <darkdrgn2k> its not enough to throw the cert in /etc/ssl/certs ?
[20:10:20] <jelly> nope
[20:10:30] <darkdrgn2k> what else needs to be done?
[20:10:37] <another|> darkdrgn2k: if your system is alpine ask them
