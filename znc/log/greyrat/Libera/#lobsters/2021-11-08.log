[00:04:29] <MattWThomas[x]> riv: you mean signal uses omemo?
[00:04:48] <riv> omemo uses the same crypto internals as signal
[00:09:52] <bkero> err
[00:10:02] <bkero> You might say Signal's protocol was OMEMO
[00:10:07] <bkero> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OMEMO#History
[00:10:07] <mockturtle> [ OMEMO - Wikipedia ] - en.wikipedia.org
[00:10:40] <bkero> Or started out that way
[00:10:52] <riv> bkero: I don't think it would be correct to say that
[00:10:59] <bkero> Why not?
[00:11:59] <MattWThomas[x]> riv: that makes sense
[00:12:49] <MattWThomas[x]> I know WhatsApp started with a relatively standard XMPP implementation
[00:14:02] <bkero> From what I'm reading, it's suggesting that axolotl (now signal protocol) was implemented from omemo
[00:14:16] <bkero> but some stuff on top like encrypted file transfer

Is there a general pattern for "save all state" that I'm just not smart enough to do? Maybe if you do something like always store state in a single struct/object/dict and always read and write from that one struct.
[22:52:11] <kline> base64 usually has 65 chars
[22:52:15] <kline> 64 data chars and a padding char
[22:52:26] <JordiGH> Not sure this is base64 after all, no obvious padding.
[22:52:51] <Brekkjern> There are other encoding standards than b64
[22:53:07] <kline> padding chars are not mandatory (only occurs at the end and only if required)
[22:53:14] <Brekkjern> That too
[22:53:38] <JordiGH> https://inversethought.com/jordi/tmp/kathy-rain-save
[22:53:55] <JordiGH> Wait, it's got newlines??
[22:54:00] <JordiGH> How'd I miss that
[22:54:28] <Brekkjern> JordiGH: If you need to test out lots of various crap to figure out the dataformat I can recommend using cyberchef for it.
[22:55:07] <JordiGH> I wish gamedevs would just use plain formats for save games. That's my data!
[22:55:29] <JordiGH> But I guess it's also their data because it refers to a lot of internal game data.
[22:56:10] <kline> theres too much incentive for users to "cheat" by save editing, also its definitely not a stable format when you account for patches
[22:56:37] <JordiGH> Oh, no newlines, that's just my browser trying to be helpful by inserting line breaks.
[22:56:50] <JordiGH> kline: Yeah, let people cheat!
[22:57:08] <JordiGH> Like, is it cheating if I read a book by flipping to the last page first?
[22:57:11] <kline> savegame editors already come with warnings about rinsing your shit, i cant imagine that making it easy for anyone to edit it in notepad will lead to good reviews when they whine about a new patch breaking their 200h savegame because they fiddled with it once 6 months ago
[22:57:49] <JordiGH> I bet some authors would like to DRM their books so it's impossible to read the last page first.
[22:58:41] <kline> im ok with people editing their saves but if a studio was going to approve of it they should release tools for correctly doing so, validating and backing them up
[22:58:58] <kline> allowing people to do it ad-hoc is a recipe for disaster in their eyes
[22:59:38] <JordiGH> >:(
[22:59:46] <kline> problem is that i dont think basically a single game exists that ever budgeted time or cash for users to fiddle with stuff, esp where it rubs against DRM potential
[22:59:48] <JordiGH> Software isn't harmed by people changing it.
[23:00:07] <technomancy> so the real reason is that gamers are just tremendously stupid and will blame breakage on the game instead of the edits they did?
[23:00:09] <kline> JordiGH, you're looking at this from a software view, but games studios are media companies
[23:00:10] <technomancy> I mean that kinda tracks
[23:00:14] <Brekkjern> The software isn't, but the reputation of the producers are.
[23:00:16] <bkero> technomancy: tell that to m0xie
[23:00:21] <kline> technomancy, pretty much, and then the studio gets panned
[23:00:29] <JordiGH> kline: I don't think I buy games from anyone who considers themself a media company.
[23:00:37] <JordiGH> But that's because I only play old and indie games.
[23:00:38] <bkero> he won't allow third party clients connect to signal platform because he claims it will harm users
[23:01:08] <JordiGH> How can Moxie even stop that anyway?
[23:01:09] <kline> JordiGH, lots of indie games are very much in the media space, viewing themselves as creative media soloists just using software as the medium
[23:01:22] <JordiGH> Why can't I just make a third party Signal client that says, "yep, i'm legit".
[23:01:34] <technomancy> JordiGH: because moxie has lawyers
[23:01:57] <JordiGH> So do we and we have the GPL? Didn't he release it under the GPL?
[23:02:15] <kline> reminder: foss people are only a subset of pro-privacy people
[23:02:41] <kline> there are a number of people who write software who are privacy proponents but do not believe that open systems are necessarily the way to do this
[23:03:26] <JordiGH> Moxie is weird and Signal is annoying to use.
[23:03:44] <technomancy> yes

[23:05:47] <kline> (PGP first released in 1991, but it was 1995 before they made it an open standard by RFC, and 1999 before GnuPG released as a compatible free implementation)
[23:07:40] <JordiGH> And it sucks so bad that nobody knows how to use it and we kind of want to give up on it.

[23:23:20] <technomancy> JordiGH: you don't use .authinfo.gpg in emacs?

[23:29:23] <JordiGH> bsandro: Nobody cares if my commits really come from me. :(
[23:29:54] <JordiGH> One time I was signing a contract over the internet I thought, aha, I'll sign with GPG, that's a real signature, and the lawyers were like "lol no".
[23:30:20] <technomancy> "attach a PNG of your name instead; that's much more official" >_<
[23:30:47] <JordiGH> I've been signing an X for the past few years whenenver someone asks for a signature of mine.
[23:30:48] <Brekkjern> I can't remember when I signed something last
[23:31:09] <JordiGH> Brekkjern: Using credit cards in the US requires pen and ink.
[23:31:10] <technomancy> online signature requests are extremely funny
[23:31:22] <technomancy> it's like "what if your name, but in a handwritingey font instead?"
[23:31:48] <JordiGH> So last time I was in the US I was like "sure, here's an X".
[23:32:11] <JordiGH> You know the funny thing, when they hand you contracts and use pen to indicate an X and say "sign here".... that means they already signed for you.
[23:32:27] <technomancy> we were trying to get my kid to come up with a signature and he was absolutely NOT buying it
[23:32:35] <JordiGH> Ahahahahaha
[23:32:47] <technomancy> "you have to write your name, but a different way? with squiggles and stuff? why??"
[23:32:47] <JordiGH> "what the fuck is this antedeluvian bullshit"
[23:33:21] <technomancy> sometimes I think it's good to be around kids just to remind you how absurd the things you take for granted are
[23:33:28] <Brekkjern> It is absolutely an antiquated bullshit practice :P
[23:33:59] <Brekkjern> Actually, I can remember last I signed something. For some reason, the payment system failed and had to go to backup solution...
[23:34:11] <JordiGH> "My" kid was confused by why his night stand clock was wrong yesterday. All of the other clocks had the right time.

[23:48:35] <JordiGH> I bet the profession of that person who verified the veracity of signatures doesn't even exist in the US anymore.

[23:48:57] <varjag> way to go
