[10:18:01] <serafeim> i.e i presume that phoenix channels is a think layer over phoenix pubsub. correct ?

[13:33:17] <croeso[m]> pubsub is the lowest level based on beam messages, channels are probably two layers on top - they are based on web sockets subscribed to pubsub, and liveview is built on top of channels for solving a particular problem of updating the dom

[13:49:52] <serafeim> croeso[m]: so pubsub is using websockets ?
[13:50:27] <Nicd> pubsub has nothing to do with websockets
[13:50:34] <serafeim> hm
[13:50:48] <serafeim> channels is using websockets then
[13:50:57] <Nicd> channels use websockets as transport and also use pubsub internally
[13:51:05] <serafeim> ok
[13:53:11] <serafeim> let's suppose i've got a chat app which is implemented through a live view. a user inputs a message. how should i "notify" my other users using the same liveview ? 
[13:53:22] <serafeim> can i use pubsub for that ?
[13:53:30] <Nicd> yes
[13:54:14] <serafeim> so my liveviews will listen to a pubsub topic and when a new messages arrives it will be published to that topic ? and then the liveviews will change their assigns in a handle_info ? 
[13:55:34] <Nicd> yes
[13:55:45] <serafeim> ok thank you i'll try it now
[13:55:51] <serafeim> seems easy
[13:56:15] <Nicd> I use this pubsub in my app: https://gitlab.com/Nicd/geo-therminator/-/blob/trunk/lib/geo_therminator/pump_api/device/pub_sub.ex
[13:56:34] <Nicd> here it is in the supervisor: https://gitlab.com/Nicd/geo-therminator/-/blob/trunk/lib/geo_therminator/application.ex#L15

[14:01:08] <serafeim> where do you handle the pubsub messages in the LV ?
[14:02:33] <serafeim> the thing is that i've subscribed to the topic in my liveview but the handle_info isn't called
[14:02:49] <Nicd> in the handle_info
[14:03:24] <Nicd> all those messages are coming from the pubsub
[14:03:38] <serafeim> i'm doing something wrong because i don't get any messages
[14:04:41] <serafeim> i see that you've added a specific module for your pubsub: https://gitlab.com/Nicd/geo-therminator/-/blob/trunk/lib/geo_therminator/pump_api/device/pub_sub.ex ... is this needed ? i haven't added something similar
[14:04:55] <Nicd> it's just helper functions to avoid typing
[14:05:06] <serafeim> yes that's what i thought
[14:05:27] <serafeim> i'm just adding this to my application.ex: {Phoenix.PubSub, name: Ostrich.PubSub},
[14:05:36] <serafeim> then i do this on my live view: Phoenix.PubSub.subscribe(Ostrich.PubSub, "events")
[14:05:51] <serafeim> and i do this in a genserver when an event happens: Phoenix.PubSub.broadcast(Ostrich.PubSub, "events", %{event: "player_left", payload: %{player_id: player_left_id}})
[14:06:10] <serafeim> the live view doesn't have any handle_info and no exception is thrown
[14:06:33] *** Parts: Zevv (~Zevvvvv@185.238.131.12) ()
[14:06:35] <serafeim> does liveview have a fallback handle info that surpresses messages ?
[14:06:47] <Nicd> I think it logs or dumps messages
[14:07:21] <serafeim> no i don't see anything
[14:07:31] <serafeim> shall i add a handle_info to see what will happen >?
[14:07:33] <Nicd> try adding a handle_info then
[14:08:26] <Nicd> it's useful to add a `def handle_info(msg, socket) do Logger.debug("Unknown msg #{inspect(msg)}"); {:noreply, socket} end` during development
[14:08:54] <serafeim> ah yes
[14:08:56] <serafeim> it throws now
[14:08:58] <serafeim> thanks
[14:10:41] <serafeim> i think that if you add a handle_info it will just throw when it can't match
[14:11:44] <Nicd> it does

[14:48:58] <serafeim> i was doing it like this in another project: `$("button[phx-click='next']").click()` (i.e fake a button click). but can it be done directly ?
[14:52:33] <serafeim> also i hate mounts so can i do it without mounts
[14:54:15] <serafeim> hi!!! pls help ?
[14:54:34] <serafeim> oh well i'll do the buttons things
[15:01:58] <v0idpwn> use hooks
[15:02:14] <v0idpwn> its the canonical approach for that.
[15:02:32] <v0idpwn> its in the docs: https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/js-interop.html#content
[15:08:15] <serafeim> v0idpwn: hooks is more complicated than my brain can handle
[15:08:38] <serafeim> why use hooks and not something like `Phoenix.send_event("foo", payload)`
[15:08:50] <serafeim> why make my life miserable ?
[15:11:46] <v0idpwn> I may be wrong, but I believe this is because liveview events are not absent of context. For example, if an event is emitted from a component, it may be received by the component, and not by the parent liveview.
[15:13:28] <v0idpwn> but I know for sure you can achieve pretty much what you said with hooks with a bit of boilerplate and helper functions. I'm not strong enough on JS to tell you how, tho :)
[15:17:12] <serafeim> lol me neither
[15:17:19] <serafeim> also i may be storng in js but i hate it
[15:17:35] <serafeim> and i am using the live views particularly to avoid JS

[22:34:52] <benwilson512> serafeim: that particular case is tricky, since basically the way it works is that every cell references the rendered_board assign
[22:35:04] <benwilson512> so if the assign changes, all of those cells are marked dirty
[22:35:39] <benwilson512> change tracking is done at the assign level
[22:39:25] <benwilson512> serafeim: I believe you could at least improve things to a single row or column by rendering a component for each inner part eg
[22:40:37] <benwilson512> ah no hm, not sure. serafeim might be worth making a forum post
[22:41:25] <serafeim> thanks benwilson512 
[22:41:39] <serafeim> at least i'm not missing something obvious
