[01:34:45] <johncs> Added #4476 to the 4.3.1 milestone since it's sort-of a package deal with another PR that made it in

[01:35:14] <johncs> Sounds like we should make another milestone and wait until we cut a release to add any more though MaxLeiter?
[01:36:52] <val> what is the purpose of this offset? https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/blob/master/src/plugins/messageStorage/sqlite.js#L226
[01:37:27] <val> it doesn't seem to be used used, as the client doesn't (and can't) fetch more than the first page of results
[01:37:41] <val> so it's always 0
[01:38:39] <johncs> I’d guess it’s in support of an unfinished pagination feature

[01:40:21] <johncs> Offset based pagination often isn’t the best way to go… though it might be the only way with SQLite.
[01:42:43] <val> my thoughts exactly when seeing the offset
[01:43:14] <val> so I wrote a patch to make it run optimally, then I looked into testing the patch... and that's how I noticed it's unused

[01:49:34] <johncs> haha well is all that sunk cost giving you motivation to implement pagination ;)
[01:49:44] <val> ... it did
[01:50:15] <val> but I really don't want to do the front-end part of it
[01:50:35] <johncs> ah i see, yeah that's the bulk of the work i'd guess
[01:51:11] <johncs> for a bit there i was trying to figure out how to implement "go to message" from the search pane
[01:51:18] <johncs> kinda lost interest though honestly
[01:51:33] <johncs> reactions are much more interesting to me, and i haven't even actually worked on that for awhile

[10:42:41] <fnutt> MaxLeiter: Including 4372 sounds very nice, especially with a third button.... although I don't like having the text uploaded as a plain .txt file. Displaying/reading a plain .txt file is rather horrible. :/
[10:48:35] <bookworm> I really think that we should leave the display to the user agent of the receiving end. Considering that you don't know what the setup of the receiving end looks like, annotate it as text/plain and leave it up to them
[10:49:00] <bookworm> *within* TL we can then add a nice wrapper that makes a nice, formatted text input that's scrollable etc
[10:49:16] <fnutt> We have very different opinions regarding this.
[10:49:20] <bookworm> however, simply making a sub-par paste bin on top of a good IRC client should really be out of scope
[10:49:22] <bookworm> yes
[10:50:07] <bookworm> but so far you failed to give convincing arguments why we can't use the mime headers like they are supposed to be used and insist on linking to a specific web page
[10:50:12] <fnutt> I agree about displaying the uploaded text nicely in-line in TL. But I also think that most people clicking on the link will open it in a browser. Opening a .txt file in a browser is just absolutly trash!
[10:50:12] <bookworm> we don't do it with images, we shouldn'
[10:50:18] <bookworm> shouldn't do it with text either
[10:50:27] <bookworm> then fix the browser
[10:50:54] <fnutt> Good luck telling Google, Mozilla and Microsoft that!
[10:51:26] <fnutt> Please get back to us here when they've fixed it on your behalf.
[10:51:27] <bookworm> if it bugs you, at least firefox allows you to set default style for text, so you can add margins etc
[10:52:08] <bookworm> what I really hate though, is that you try to force everyone to use the browser in the first place
[10:52:34] <bookworm> it's effing text, if a client can display that easily they should be able to do so (and every single thing on this earth can display text in computer land)
[10:52:41] <fnutt> Most clients, as far as I know, will use the browser when clicking on an url in their IRC client.
[10:52:52] <bookworm> who said anything about clicking?
[10:53:01] <fnutt> It's an url?!
[10:53:07] <bookworm> It's a link, it gets pre-fetched by the client, noticed it's plain text and then displayed
[10:53:18] <bookworm> how do you think TL pre-fetches images? That's a link too\
[10:53:26] <fnutt> ....and do you really believe all clients have a nice way to embedd .txt files in-line?
[10:53:43] <bookworm> and it doesn't put you on some random website of whatever the IRC client is of the sending party does it?
[10:53:49] <fnutt> I know, but TL at least tries to embedd things in-line.
[10:53:49] <bookworm> no they don't
[10:54:00] <bookworm> do you really think everyone has a nice image preview? They don't
[10:54:02] <fnutt> Have not seen IRSSI, mIRC, HexChat etc do this.
[10:54:29] <bookworm> they *could* if you use text/plain
[10:54:41] <bookworm> use a random webpage and *they can't*
[10:54:42] <bookworm> that' sthe point
[10:55:09] <fnutt> Exactly... and I don't fancy that either. But showing an image in a browser looks A LOT better than plain text on white background, as .txt files.....
[10:55:30] <bookworm> it looks as shitty as plain text if you are used to a better way of doing things
[10:56:19] <fnutt> I think we should make something nice ourself and do what looks good and modern.... Not thinking that we can change the world and make all other IRC clients show .txt files in-line. We're neither jesus or superman....
[10:56:20] <bookworm> fixing the default of the browser is not something we are in charge of, but I vehemently oppose the direction of embeding a paste-bin "because I dislike the default style of the browser"
[10:56:31] <bookworm> well then don't open text/plain in your browser
[10:57:07] <bookworm> you will be using TL, we can make it look nice within TL
[10:57:16] <bookworm> don't oppose your views on the remote side, they will differ
[10:57:29] <fnutt> MaxLeiter: Can I pretty please get your opinion regarding this? ^^ We're not getting anywhere here.
[10:57:54] <bookworm> and if people prefer to open text links within vim they should be able to do so, without getting html garbage
[10:58:35] <bookworm> curl > output should give you plain text too!
[10:58:42] <bookworm> not some styled embeded bullshit
[10:59:02] <fnutt> Basicly, what you're saying is - throw out shit.... and make everyone else find a way to watch/read it in a propper way that is not browser based (which is default for most IRC clients).
[10:59:36] <bookworm> it's not shit for gods sake! It's properly annotated context
[11:00:03] <fnutt> I hardly think 95 % of the IRC users will find a way to watch/read the shit we throw out in an url.
[11:00:26] <bookworm> how do you think IRC survived up until now?
[11:00:49] <bookworm> why do you think there's a whole bunch of IRC bots that immediately rewrite some fancy pastebin to a plain/text one?
[11:00:49] <fnutt> and has lost so much popularity against other more modern chat platforms?
[11:01:11] <fnutt> It's like you're stuck in 1990's.... 
[11:01:16] <bookworm> if people want all the fancy stuff they don't use IRC
[11:01:28] <bookworm> there's a bunch of happy people who *want* to use IRC the way it is
[11:01:44] <bookworm> we don't need to emulate all the other IM's, it's ok to be different
[11:02:11] <fnutt> Let's at least try to make an effort doing it nicely, modern! We have taken a large step in the right direction with TL.
[11:02:25] <bookworm> we can make it modern *within* TL
[11:02:30] <bookworm> I never said we shouldn't
[11:02:33] <fnutt> Those can also use a large selection of other clients.
[11:02:48] <bookworm> no
[11:02:49] <fnutt> Make it modern for us, shit for everyone?
[11:02:58] <fnutt> Nice one!
[11:03:03] <bookworm> you keep saying shit when we actually do what we are supposed to
[11:03:19] <bookworm> text/plain looks bad *in your opinion* in the browser
[11:03:43] <bookworm> I use vim to look at plain text ,not sure what you can say about my vim setup? I'd say you have no clue at all
[11:03:59] <bookworm> same goes for my weechat setup, or someone's irssi setup with a bunch of custom script
[11:03:59] <fnutt> Sure sure.... but the world isn't that easy! We cannot force change all other IRC clients, nor can we force all IRC users to change the default way of showing .txt URLS.
[11:04:02] <bookworm> YOU HAVE NO CLUE
[11:04:22] <bookworm> so stop saying "it'll look like shit" because the thing *you* happen to be using isn't styled nicely
[11:04:41] <bookworm> yes, FOR YOU it looks bad, personal opinion
[11:04:43] <fnutt> I have enough clue to understand this... and enough clue to have seen how many IRC clients handle .txt urls.
[11:04:58] <fnutt> There's been others agreeing with me on this, bookworm. 
[11:05:02] <bookworm> yes
[11:05:03] <fnutt> and you know that!
[11:05:22] <bookworm> You fail to give arguments besides "looks bad in browser"
[11:05:30] <bookworm> the other one that agreed with you did likewise
[11:05:39] <fnutt> THAT*S HOW THE FUCKING MAJORITY WILL WATCH IT! for fuck sake...
[11:05:46] <bookworm> there's a reason mime types exist, exactly so that different clients can do different things
[11:05:50] <fnutt> Can you understand that now+!?!
[11:05:53] <bookworm> and that you can use whatever you like to open things
[11:06:10] <bookworm> the majority isn't using TL and doesn't have IRC in a browser
[11:06:11] <fnutt> Sure, but that doesn't happen in a lot of popular clients...
[11:06:24] <fnutt> So I wish you good luck in forcing them to fix this.
[11:06:33] <bookworm> I don't force them to do anything
[11:06:42] <bookworm> Embedding a pastebin would force stuff
[11:06:47] <fnutt> So let's make something nice then for everyone.....
[11:07:01] <bookworm> which is *precisely* what I want to avoid
[11:07:09] <fnutt> and when the world has changed and most clients have fixed this, we can change it.
[11:07:18] <bookworm> no
[11:07:22] <fnutt> IRCCloud does it.
[11:07:26] <bookworm> yes
[11:07:34] <bookworm> I don't like it there either
[11:07:38] <fnutt> SOmetimes I wish you could get some inspiration from it.
[11:07:44] <fnutt> You don't like it. Many does.
[11:07:49] <bookworm> and I hate it if I'm on a pastebin and the first thing I need to do is find the effing raw link
[11:08:03] <fnutt> Anyway, please MaxLeiter. I would like your opinion on this.
[11:08:57] <fnutt> I will stop now. No point in talking to a wall. Have a good day, bookworm.
[11:09:02] <bookworm> johncs: MaxLeiter assigning in the reviewer section I guess? And just assume that everyone present in the reviewers tab nees to ack it?
[11:18:39] <bookworm> fnutt: there's a middle ground, emit plain text *by default* but if the http accept header contains text/html as the first option then adhere to that and send the fancy version
[11:18:47] <bookworm> that would satisfy both views
[11:19:02] <bookworm> (yes, browsers do that)
[11:19:37] <MaxLeiter> fnutt: I feel like if you want a pastebin you should go to one, anything more than just serving a file feels like a maintenance burden / we wont be able to do it well enough 
[11:20:19] <MaxLeiter> this hopefully stops users from spamming multiple auto-split messages, its not supposed to be a fully featured paste service 
[11:20:25] <fnutt> We cannot do something similar to IRCCloud?
[11:20:27] <bookworm> we also shouldn't make to easy to spam text blobs, else we are no better than the effing matrix brdige
[11:21:02] <MaxLeiter> irccloud wrote a pastebin right?
[11:21:04] <bookworm> else you end up with useless "read full messages $there"
[11:21:05] <bookworm> https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/2cfbe77f32cead71042223e73999c2923032ac73
[11:21:08] <MaxLeiter> id rather stick to being an irc client 
[11:21:33] <fnutt> Not really a pastebin. But it has A TINY bit of.... formatting of the text.
[11:22:00] <fnutt> and a button where you can click raw text, and... hmm.. I cannot remember.
[11:22:11] <fnutt> But it looks so much better than just plain txt for sure.
[11:22:18] <bookworm> *too you*
[11:22:23] <MaxLeiter> Indentation is preserved, anything else isn’t our job right? Who are we to syntax highlight? 
[11:22:44] <fnutt> Not talking about syntax highlight.
[11:23:01] <fnutt> Let me get an example for you from IRCCloud. Please give me a few mins.
[11:23:48] <bookworm> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/sLh78VIy/

[11:25:19] <MaxLeiter> I see an ad and a textbot with line numbers 
[11:25:25] <MaxLeiter> box*
[11:25:28] <fnutt-irccloud> That is how it's shown in-line as well.
[11:25:52] <MaxLeiter> The cost vs benefit just doesn’t make sense to me 
[11:25:59] <fnutt> Yes. It's not syntax highlight and other fancy stuff. But it looks a lot better in browser than just plain text.
[11:26:10] <bookworm> not for me 🤷‍♂️
[11:26:22] <bookworm> I find the colorful fluff distracting
[11:26:22] <fnutt> since most sadly will have their browser opening when clicking on the url.
[11:26:23] <MaxLeiter> Yes, it’d be nice to have features, but its lots more work than just using the existing upload api + serving the file 
[11:27:05] <MaxLeiter> This PR won’t implement it, thats for sure 
[11:27:45] <fnutt> Anyway, it's okey if you don't want to implement it, MaxLeiter. At least I feel like you listen and makes a real decision not purely based on your own opinions alone. Thank you.
[11:28:17] <fnutt> Is it within the scope of the PR to have some way of showing the text file in-line?
[11:28:22] <bookworm> only because I disagree with your opinion doesn't mean that I don't listen, I just don't find much merrit in your sole argument
[11:28:28] <bookworm> and you fail to give additional ones\
[11:28:54] <bookworm> also it's kinda fun to see you say that I'm a wall and not listening while doing exactly the same thing, behavior wise
[11:29:09] <fnutt> bookworm: Let's stop and just accept we have very different opinions and understand of each others.
[11:29:33] <MaxLeiter> Take it to PM if you wanna keep the conversation going please 
[11:29:38] <bookworm> ack
[11:29:43] <bookworm> let's end it here
[11:30:05] <fnutt> MaxLeiter: Is it within the scope of the PR to have some way of showing the text file in-line? E.g. https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/vAbA7gsC/image.png
[11:30:53] <fnutt> Or something else that shows the text inside channel. Then we don't have to click on the url and read the txt raw on white background.
[11:32:48] <bookworm> Can we add cross-repo issues to milestones or do I need to add a meta issue linking those?
