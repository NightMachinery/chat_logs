[00:00:44] <bkero> Did you?
[00:00:58] <varjag> i'm of pre-folder era
[00:00:59] <maskd> the STEM bit is the paragraph chenghiz_ pasted, researchers have to know where the files are when running the code they write
[00:01:19] <chenghiz_> there are several examples given in the article
[00:01:36] <bkero> Uhh, 1920s?
[00:01:54] <varjag> soviet union in 1980s
[00:02:10] <varjag> i also had a rotary phone, bite it
[00:02:21] <kiedtl> Ancient
[00:02:28] <cb> gwozniak: here's an idea for you
[00:02:40] <cb> people in CS education in the 70s had literally never seen a computer before
[00:02:58] <cb> in the 80s quite a few had experience with a computer fo some kind
[00:03:07] <technomancy> I still can't get over the idea of putting a folder in a folder and someone's watching it and they're like "whoa! where did that folder go!" like they just discovered object permanence
[00:03:20] <riv> lol
[00:03:20] <cb> (but not everyon! due to Gender Bullshit, people didn't give their daughters computers as much)
[00:03:22] <kiedtl> lol
[00:04:35] <maskd> I also get a bit exasperated when I see someone using the "find file in project" thing to open a file that's in the same directory as the file they're currently editing
[00:04:49] <maskd> but I guess search is the way of the future and I need to get used to always using it
[00:05:03] <varjag> when i use projectile in emacs that's essentially the same thing
[00:05:15] <varjag> eschewing the wonderful dired cuz i can't be arsed
[00:05:30] <pushcx> gwozniak: updated, thanks
[00:05:38] <maskd> I do prefer searching eg. Firefox settings instead of looking for the place where I expect the setting to be
[00:06:05] <gerikson> yeah
[00:06:29] <cb> it depends on the thing if i use search or hierarchy, occasionally w/ spatial memory
[00:06:34] <gerikson> I dunno if insanely complex settings panes like the one in MS SQL server have internal search yet
[00:06:38] <cb> i'd like to see tags more but there's no real good general purpose tag thing
[00:06:41] <iDrougge> cb: But no computers in the 80s had nested directories.
[00:06:57] <cb> unix and multics did but it was a rarity elsewhere
[00:07:02] <cb> DOS 2.x just added the concept
[00:07:06] <varjag> also using autojump instead of cd makes command line life so. much. easier.
[00:07:11] <iDrougge> I mean computers people actually had
[00:07:31] <iDrougge> It's difficult to have directories when your directory is a cassette tape.
[00:07:31] <cb> right
[00:07:39] <cb> home computers were NOT like the minis and minframes CS depts had
[00:07:46] <cb> so they'd need to learn again
[00:08:00] <cb> again, just because you're good with one kind of computer, the one with rawdog basic and poking memory
[00:08:09] <cb> doesnt mean you're goods at one with hierarchial directories and memory protection
[00:09:14] <iDrougge> I'm not convinced any generation has dealt much with directory structures, apart from exactly the group that self-selected into computer science programmes.
[00:09:39] *** mulliken is now known as mulliken|away
[00:10:08] <varjag> my first disk os definitely hadn't nested directories
[00:10:10] <gwozniak> My wife knows all about directories/folders, but finds organizing things to be too much of a chore
[00:10:23] <varjag> but iirc i knew the concept

[00:10:31] <poww0wmus1c> just use the google
[00:10:38] <manicennui> I feel like you either immediately get it or basically never do.
[00:10:46] <manicennui> It's not really complicated.
[00:11:09] <technomancy> it's easy to not get it if you use an environment that goes out of its way to obscure what's really happening
[00:11:27] <iDrougge> Yeah, like Git.
[00:11:35] <manicennui> I was about to say that the UI around it often obscures what is going on.
[00:11:53] <manicennui> Only showing you the current directory or maybe one level higher.
[00:12:06] <manicennui> Which is one of the reasons why I add the full path to my shell prompt.
[00:12:10] <iDrougge> All your blobs are inside a directory structure grouped by the first two letters of the hash, inside a hidden .git directory.
[00:12:26] <manicennui> iDrougge: That's kind of a different issue.
[00:12:31] <technomancy> yeah git is different
[00:12:31] <manicennui> And one you hopefully don't need to know about.
[00:12:45] <technomancy> it's not "there's a hierarchy, but it's hidden" it's "there's literally no meaningful hierarchy"
[00:13:03] <technomancy> filenames are opaque blobs; "/" is not special in any way afaik
[00:13:34] <chenghiz_> anyone who's worked with digital graphics workflows has probably spent a lot of time organizing files as well
[00:13:44] <iDrougge> manicennui: I don't know about that. Git seems to hide its structure in much the same way as, say, Apple Photos does.
[00:14:12] <manicennui> iDrougge: I'm generally not concerned with its internal structure unless I have a really odd problem.
[00:14:22] <iDrougge> Same here.
[00:14:26] *** mulliken|away is now known as mulliken
[00:15:12] <manicennui> And the files you are actually working on are still in a normal directory hierarchy.

[04:25:41] <dimadima> what are criteria for automated banning
[04:25:44] <dimadima> rate limits?
[04:28:10] <dimadima> how much bad behavior is there on IRC these days
[04:29:25] <kline> we set something like ~5k automated bans a day
[04:29:48] <Church> Ahhh, good to know cb sam_
[04:30:03] <kline> almost all of them are set before the connection and "registration" (irc registration, things like setting nick and user and realname, not registering an account) are complete
[04:30:17] <kline> usually for things like being in botnet blacklists
[04:30:25] <dimadima> wow
[04:30:54] * dimadima googles botnet blacklist
[04:31:02] <kline> dronebl
[04:31:03] <dimadima> what would these clients do otherwise?
[04:31:18] <dimadima> if they were not banned
[04:32:44] <kline> we dont always know, but aside from attacking the network itself (spam, etc), botnets do like to use us as infrastructure: we're a third party message bus with excellent reachability, availability, and a very simple protocol for botnet command and control
[04:33:17] <dimadima> got it, thank you
[04:33:53] <kline> irc networks have long been used for botnet command and control because its easy for the operator to connect in from an owned host or via tor and direct botnets without having to own (= purchase = papertrail) any infrastructure themselves
[04:35:14] <dimadima> that makes a lot of sense, yes. so 5k/day = 1.8 million bans a year that need to be maintained
[04:35:24] <dimadima> they expire after a while?
[04:35:45] <kline> yes, all our bans expire
[04:35:45] <dimadima> i mean that number is not huge and they can be indexed but still
[04:36:03] <kline> quicker than a year. theres a way to enumerate all the bans but im not going to bother just now
[04:36:46] <dimadima> the internet!
[04:36:51] <kline> -- | stats :* g - Shows global K lines
[04:37:29] <kline> so staff can `/stats g` to get a list of kill lines, but i dont intend to dump this to my client
[04:37:43] <dimadima> yeah

So I thought I would comment on it but since I'm not a registered user, I can't. So, would someone out there care to either add it to the discussion, or provide me with an invite ? TBH I'm not planning to participate that much, but I won't be spamming

[17:54:37] <gwozniak> Once the score is 5, it will show it.  Otherwise it takes about 24 hours or so
[17:54:47] <pja> My experience as an end user is: unpack tarball, run ./configure, then make, get working binary.
[17:54:56] <pja> That’s pretty good!

[17:55:27] <riv> i agree that it's awful for the developer :P

[21:56:23] <riv> so my friend explained something very simple to me about matrix
[21:56:35] <riv> if a chatroom has n people, and 1 person sends a message
[21:57:11] <riv> the message is sent to everyone, but then everyone sends back a 'ive read it recipt' at different times
[21:57:29] <riv> the n 'ive read it recipts' are broadcast back to all n-1 people
[21:57:48] <riv> so literally every time a message is sent on matrix it incurs O(n^2) blow up of traffic
[21:57:58] <riv> this is bad
[21:58:34] <cot> babymosesinabasket why? what's so useful about being able to check if each user in a channel has recieved a message they didn't send??
[21:58:45] <riv> :)
[21:59:01] <indigo> What's the alternative?
[21:59:16] <cot> s/they didn't send/they weren't sent to specifically/
[21:59:30] <technomancy> that's literally what read receipts are, yeah
