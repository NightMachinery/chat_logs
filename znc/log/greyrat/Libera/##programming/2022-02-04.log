[01:25:58] <nomagno> Essentially nowadays TLS works by having one of the 'big trust sources' sign the start of your chain, then you work your way down the chain with different sources until you reach something like LetsEncrypt or a paid one, then that generates a certificate for your domain
[01:26:27] <nomagno> If you don't have one of the major root certificates at the beggining of your chain, many web browsers will consider your connection to be compromised/insecure
[01:26:45] <nomagno> trustful model, essentially
[01:26:59] <nomagno> I think trustless is better in every case, but hard to execute I guess

[02:01:45] <ProfSimm> ski: a modern compilers has dozens of passes, some of which include interpreting full-on templating/macro/constexpr languages. I think the classic division is useful, but is kinda irrelevant if you think about it.
[02:02:31] <Decker> pyzozord uhmm... well someone has to do the signing - it's always cost money for some reason ... there's at least 1 out with letsencrypt... but apparently it's a bad idea to give just anyone security? I don't know.
[02:02:34] <ProfSimm> ski: it's like some arguing whether Java is a compiled language, or interpreted, or JIT. It's all of that.
[02:02:35] <ski> in its most basic form, "compilation" merely means taking a program (in some language) as input, and transforming it into a (in some sense equivalent) program (in some language)
[02:02:40] <Decker> pyzozord it's the man :) 
[02:03:08] <ProfSimm> ski: sure but what do we call it when we take a program, make another program, then take that and make another out of it and so on and so on until some final step.
[02:03:19] <ski> e.g. if you write a function to transform a regex description to a finite state automaton, which you could then invoke on various strings, i'd consider that a case of (usually run-time) compilation
[02:03:31] <ProfSimm> ski: what if these steps are not carried in block but just in time as expressions are evaluated
[02:03:42] <nomagno> I'm surprised at how much less painful coding in my own assembly is after I added a primitive preprocessor
[02:03:51] <ProfSimm> ski: it's a transformation pipeline
[02:03:59] <ski> (yea, it's not really that useful to try to classify languages as compiled or interpreted. rather, language implementations, and even then, it's often not as clear-cut)

[02:20:20] <ski> ProfSimm : (a) that you segregate the inputs to the program (that it partially evaluates) into "early" and "late" inputs. then, the partial evaluator provides the early inputs to the program, and evaluated/reduces/executes the parts that it can, given those inputs, then residualizing (generating output code for) the remaning parts (that depend on the late inputs)
[02:20:37] <ski> s/then/\(b\) then/
[02:21:21] <ProfSimm> ski: well "early" and "late" is kinda pointless when you have no fixed number of transformation stages, or a fixed final stage of evaluation
[02:22:17] <PlanckWalk> You can run multiple partial evaluations
[02:22:18] <ski> a partial evaluator can be on-line or off-line. off-line means that it decides which parts of the program to reduce, before seeing the actual early inputs (but after knowing which inputs will be early), while an on-line one can make decisions on the fly (e.g. some numerical result is zero, so product with zero is zero)

[02:44:20] <ProfSimm> ski: it's useful to think in stages, but I think it's maybe less meaningful to label them. Because you can add stages, remove stages, even reorder stages in some cases.
[02:44:55] <ski> hm, what do you mean by "label them" ?
[02:44:59] <ski> label, how ?
[02:45:31] <ProfSimm> ski: for example since the system stores the AST, and not the source, I have no parsing stage either. It's something that happens when you specifically call a function within the system to take text and get an AST out of it

[04:48:20] <absentia> and yes indexing
[04:48:21] <ProfSimm> gambl0re: that's not how to code well. 
[04:48:37] <ProfSimm> gambl0re: you need to trust others, but also understand their motivation, not just do what they do because they maybe know why
[04:48:37] <absentia> but you can index columns other than the ID
[04:48:39] <absentia> and often you do
[04:48:45] <oldlaptop> Your database engine is /fairly/ likely to be able to do lookups based on an integer primary key faster than lookups on some other kind of primary key. But if the only kind of lookup you ever do is for this textual primary key (or UUID primary key, if your database has a special type for that), this isn't any use to you.
[04:48:46] <gambl0re> absentia: so should i include the id column even if i wont need it?
[04:48:59] <ProfSimm> gambl0re: you can always add that column if you need it technically.

[04:50:15] <absentia> gambl0re: though you should understand the differences between using a UUID and an autoincrementing integer for example
[04:50:35] <oldlaptop> There might be performance reasons to have a different key, if for example most of your key lookups are actually not based on this UUID.
[04:50:38] <gambl0re> because uuid's are 18 bit right? compared to 8 bit id's?
[04:50:39] <ProfSimm> Not a fan of UUIDs myself but eh, it works
[04:50:40] <absentia> for instance UUIDs are four times as large as 32-bit ints
[04:50:45] <absentia> they are 128-bit
[04:50:55] <oldlaptop> For example, maybe your system will be doing lots of lookups to support foreign keys referencing this table.
[04:51:04] <gambl0re> so they are slower to query is that what you mean?
[04:51:08] <oldlaptop> UUIDs could be even longer than that, if you're storing them as text.
[04:51:19] <absentia> gambl0re: they occupy more space on disk
[04:51:22] <absentia> oldlaptop: good point
[04:51:26] <oldlaptop> gambl0re: Probably. Whether it's enough to matter is another question, probably one you can only answer with measurement.

[04:52:35] <gambl0re> whats the diff between pk and unique index?
[04:52:54] <ProfSimm> gambl0re: the PK is used internally to refer to the rows on most DB.
[04:53:06] <oldlaptop> The database engine is probably going to lay out the table itself on disk according to the primary key, somehow.
[04:53:19] <oldlaptop> (What it will actually do depends on which database engine you're using.)
[04:53:29] <absentia> gambl0re: also keep in mind the more columns you need to index, the slower your writes will be
[04:53:33] <ProfSimm> gambl0re: you can also use the id PK for foreign keys in other tables
[04:53:43] <absentia> which is another good reason for limiting the number of indices you build
[04:53:47] <oldlaptop> A unique constraint will generally cause a separate index to be created on that column, which has obvious costs associated with it.
[04:54:06] <absentia> then again
[04:54:09] <ProfSimm> gambl0re: and as noted you can only have one PK. The PK is also a unique index BTW, but as noted it has additional roles
[04:54:18] <absentia> unless you are at the 100GB+ scale probably none of this matters
[04:54:42] <oldlaptop> Whether those costs matter for your application is a question that's much more difficult to answer, arguably impossible without empirical measurement.

[05:09:37] <KillerWasp> ProfSimm: Not having a phone is just one of the perks of being a crazy peasant nobody believes.
[05:09:43] <vms14> and choosing java really makes your development much slower than many of other languages
[05:09:56] <vdamewood> But gcc still can't find sys/signal.h

[05:15:49] <gambl0re> i added a fk constraint with delete on cascade
[05:16:14] <gambl0re> so when i delete a user, i want all rows that fk to user_id to be deleted as well
[05:16:16] <gambl0re> is that correct?
[05:16:22] <gambl0re> or am i doing something wrong here

[05:16:46] <vdamewood> vms14: That condescending attitude is most unfriendly.
[05:17:25] <vms14> vdamewood: I think I was helping you
[05:17:44] <SGautam> So I have a display_text which is a string, a cursor_pos which tells my insertion location in the string and I have a way to put string on the screen. How do I make it such that I am able print only the part of the string that needs to be on the display and also am able to advance left and right on the textbox? It seems such a complicated behaviour to implement?
[05:18:09] <SGautam> The easy way out is to divide the string text into "blocks" of strings that can be displayed one at a time on the textbox (=textbox_width / font_width), and simply set display_text to next block whenever cursor_pos moves past one of the blocks.  But that doesn't mimic actual textbox behaviour where it scrolls in a much more natural way, one character at a time.

[07:17:35] <edgar-rft> I don't wanna know what "fk_user_id" means :-)
[07:17:50] <absentia> it's the user you've fk'ed in your ddl
[07:21:08] <gambl0re> this is db talk for those that dont know what my question is about
[07:21:10] <gambl0re> thanks
[07:23:18] <acidcrawl> you are trying to delete a user from the profiles table, but a record associated with that user exists in the bestdesigns table.
[07:24:19] <Decker> it's probably not a delete - it's a terminal table, and users PK is somewhere else (but I saw this table schema the other day)
[07:24:46] <Decker> deleting a user_id that exists in child tables would be the other interpreation though   gambl0re
[07:25:47] <gambl0re> yea i know but its not working for some reason
[07:25:56] <acidcrawl> No, the key is a foreign key in the bestdesigns table, it's primary in the profiles table.
[07:26:01] <Decker> inserting without the user-id in parent

[07:26:47] <acidcrawl> but it's an update or delete in the profiles table, seems to make more sense that it's trying to delete the record
[07:26:58] <Decker> though - I usually define 'on update cascade on delete cascade' 
[07:27:07] <acidcrawl> that's really bad practice
[07:27:09] <acidcrawl> like really bad
[07:27:12] <Decker> o
[07:27:13] <Decker> o
[07:27:14] <gambl0re> i have a users table, id column is PK
[07:27:34] <gambl0re> i have a projects table with user_id as FK to users table(id)
[07:27:55] <Decker> so you're saying you don't have a profiles table?
[07:28:00] <gambl0re> i try to delete user id 1 and i expect related projects to be deleted too but cannot
[07:28:07] <gambl0re> error message about violation

[07:29:03] <acidcrawl> delete the associated records in the bestdesigns table and it will work.
[07:29:14] <gambl0re> yes the bestdesigns table has a user_id column that points to profiles(id) column

[07:30:02] <gambl0re> i did that
[07:30:06] <acidcrawl> well, in that case you would define on the constraint a cascade delete

[09:31:47] <tomathy> and how would you do it?
[09:31:50] <InPhase> llinguini: I think that "finished" just means the client finished sending it, and then the server rejected.

[09:33:41] <quetzl> how would you set up an interrupt that can react to any time
[09:34:47] <InPhase> quetzl: Well you probably wouldn't, and would instead use the OS's timer features.

[09:35:38] <InPhase> Direct meddling with interrupts was fun while it lasted, but went out of fashion with 32-bit computers.
[09:36:18] <InPhase> quetzl: No, that's why you use the OS timer features, to avoid that.  The OS is then responsible for waking up the program when the time arrives.

[14:52:53] <braxas> If I have a snapshot of a dataset at a specific "operation index" (i.e. the index of what the last operation was to get to current state), and a stream of delta operations (create, update, delete), will I corrupt my dataset state if I apply deltas from before the snapshot's operation index to it?

[14:53:33] <braxas> This is kind of like when you setup replication for a DB, and you have to set the log position, similar question would be is it okay to set the log position earlier than the dump you loaded.
[14:54:29] *** Quits: inky (~inky@31.7.162.99) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[14:54:51] <GeDaMo> It might duplicate some work?
[14:55:08] <GeDaMo> I'd guess that the log entries should be idempotent but it may depend
[14:57:40] <PlanckWalk> I'd expect that unless the deltas are very specifically designed to allow that, it would cause corruption
[14:58:10] <PlanckWalk> Idempotence might help, but possibly not.
[14:58:50] <absentia> there are no guarantees here
[14:59:10] <braxas> I guess I will have to think about the failure modes
[14:59:27] <PlanckWalk> You woudl probably need some form of commutativity as well
[14:59:28] <braxas> for applying various Delta operations: Create, Update, Delete - I can't really think about any now
[14:59:55] <PlanckWalk> E.g. suppose you literally had create, update, delete,  and applied the update after the delete
[15:00:05] <PlanckWalk> What is that supposed to do?
[15:00:18] <braxas> well maybe I should say the event stream will be ordered
[15:00:22] <absentia> sounds like the cursor is rewinding back in time
[15:00:33] <braxas> so if you apply update after delete, then you will then just do delete
[15:00:48] <braxas> absentia: yes it is
[15:01:03] *** Quits: pavonia (~user@user/siracusa) (Quit: Bye!)
[15:01:19] <PlanckWalk> If you have a delta that says "copy the 3rd field in X to the 2nd field in Y" that's going to be bad
[15:01:31] <PlanckWalk> So you can't allow that sort of operation even though it's idempotent
[15:03:56] <GeDaMo> That's not idempotent, it depends on the value in x[3]
[15:04:14] <PlanckWalk> It's idempotent, it just doesn't commute with other operations
[15:04:23] <GeDaMo> To be idempotent it would be something like y[2] = 5 (if 5 was what was in x[3])
[15:04:24] <PlanckWalk> Idemoptent means that f(f(x)) = f(x)
[15:04:46] <PlanckWalk> And it is true that applying the operation twice does the same thing as applying it once
[15:05:05] <PlanckWalk> So you need something stronger than just idempotence

[17:25:25] <ski> user51 : well .. `switch' in say C just matches the scrutinee with a number of given literal values. it doesn't allow any "destructuring bind", like matching on different shapes of variant types, while simultaneously binding names to the (respective) parts of each alternative (in C, sum/variant types / discriminated/disjoint/tagged union types / variant record types would typically be encoded as a 
[17:25:31] <ski> `struct' with an `enum' tag indicating the alternative and a `union' containing the varying parts for each alternative)
[17:27:19] <ski> user51 : then, it's also natural to allow matching on record/product types, and to be able to nest patterns inside each other (e.g. being able to match on a binary tree node, while matching on the left subtree, while also matching on the right subtree of that)
