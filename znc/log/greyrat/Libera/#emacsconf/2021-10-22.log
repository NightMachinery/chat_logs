[05:21:22] <brandelune> I tried to add various times zones in the md, but or some reason the rendering engine did not accept the width style.
[05:22:18] <brandelune> on the shedule details

[10:56:58] <zaeph> brandelune: Hi; since I don't see the commit, I assume that, by 'rendering engine', you mentioned a local copy of the wiki?  In any case, as sachac said, let us know what you have in mind, and maybe we could accommodate your change.
[11:12:52] <brandelune> No, I mean the modifications I tried to make directly on the emacsconfwiki.
[11:12:56] <brandelune> for ex
[11:13:07] <brandelune> <tr><td width="5%">JST</td><td width="5%">PST</td><td width="5%">EST</td><td width="5%">CST</td><td colspan="3"><strong>Saturday morning (EST 9pm)<strong></td></tr>
[11:13:59] <brandelune> so that people have a rough idea of what time start the various sessions.
[11:14:48] <brandelune> reference: git 05:00:18 10/21/21
[11:19:28] <zaeph> brandelune: I think we had a solution last year to print times for different timezones; we'll look into it soon and we'll let you know.
[11:19:47] <zaeph> It's something that would be useful to all the other talks, so we'll take care of it. :)
[11:19:47] <brandelune> No problem. Thank you !
[11:20:16] <zaeph> (And I do see your commits; I just assumed that they'd be at the top of our history, but you'd done your tests earlier than that.)
[11:21:50] <codingquark> I recall last year it indeed showed local timezone

[19:14:42] <sachac> I have code to put conference timezone on the schedule page and multiple timezones on the individual talk page
[19:15:15] <sachac> we can put a summary of timezones in a tooltip for the times on the schedule
[19:15:26] <sachac> or have some Javascript to do so
[19:15:58] <sachac> We haven't posted detailed times yet because they're going to change a bit
