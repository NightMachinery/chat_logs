[00:50:22] <manicennui> meff[m]: Ruby has BigDecimal, and PostgreSQL has a decimal type.
[00:50:31] <meff[m]> I should look into how those types work

[00:50:58] <meff[m]> I don't doubt that people smarter than me know how this all works
[00:51:01] <manicennui> BigDecimal is an arbitrary precision library.
[00:51:15] <meff[m]> so is a BigDecimal then a good approximation for a real number?
[00:51:17] <manicennui> I believe most arbitrary precision libraries use ints.

[01:01:02] <manicennui> We generally use small decimals in postgres (you actually set the size).

[01:16:50] <manicennui> I think our schedules are quite a bit more complicated than mortgages.
[01:17:01] <manicennui> They aren't one payment per month for N months.

[01:19:38] <pretty_dumm_guy> however, I am just wondering why floating point issues are a problem. More often than not, you use maximum of three decimal places when dealing with money

[02:18:34] <manicennui> I couldn't tell you exactly how floats are encoded in memory.
[02:19:59] <manicennui> I know it involves a fancy Latin word.
[02:20:03] <iDrougge> My little brother recently took an introductory course in C#. The drill questions tried to teach the students the point of different types, several times asking about use cases for floats, where the use case was "a number with decimals".
[02:21:21] <iDrougge> That is quite common in introductions to programming. Students are taught the two basic numeric types: int and float. Not the three basic types.
[02:21:40] <skyl4rk> int, float, and fanatical dedication to the pope
[02:21:52] <manicennui> Not all languages have a decimal type.
[02:22:17] <manicennui> Not even C, the one true language.
[02:22:22] <cb> use the three C types
[02:22:25] <iDrougge> Not all languages have an integer type.
[02:22:26] <skyl4rk> that was the third?
[02:22:28] <technomancy> C has one type: number
[02:22:32] <manicennui> int, float, and void pointer?
[02:22:33] <technomancy> some numbers are numbers about other numbers
[02:22:43] <skyl4rk> rational would be another contender for the third
[02:22:46] <technomancy> but they're all numbers
[02:23:01] <skyl4rk> I was about to say uint int and float
[02:23:48] <iDrougge> short, long long and t_float80
[02:24:08] <cb> erlang afaik doesnt have ints

[02:30:24] <iDrougge> Of course, Go doesn't have a decimal type. Because Go.
[02:31:41] <iDrougge> And because Go doesn't support operator overloading (except on its own privileged types), it's not something you can just import.

[13:20:02] <maahl> in addition to the other recommendations, look at rustlings to get started writing some code https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings

[13:20:15] <ionface_> I've always found the best way is to start a new project in that language, the motivation is different, and instead of drudging through yet-another-syntax chapter you get on with stealing code from stackoverflow right away

[15:24:03] <ubitux> hi; i'm reading "Lurking in the channel is a bot creatively called lobstersbot" on lobste.rs/chat and i'm not sure how to parse that
[15:24:10] <ubitux> is it me failing at english?
[15:24:26] <pja> There is a bot that lurks in the channel.
[15:24:45] <iDrougge> But it's not called lobstersbot.
[15:24:45] <pja> That bot is called lobstersbot.
[15:24:52] <ubitux> yeah that's my understanding but is the sentence correct?
[15:25:07] <Brekkjern> It is, apart from the nick being changed
[15:25:08] <pja> “Creatively” applies to the second clause & is meant to be ironic.
[15:25:49] <ubitux> "lurking [...] is [...]" feels weird
[15:26:07] <ubitux> but ok
[15:26:10] <pja> It’s a typical pattern in english usage, to preface a clause with an adverb which describes the clause itself, often ironically.
[15:26:22] <ubitux> interesting
[15:26:47] <Brekkjern> Without the clause it's parsed as this: "Lurking in the channel is a bot called lobstersbot"
[15:27:04] <Brekkjern> And I find that to be rather straight forward
[15:27:08] <pja> “a bot creatively called lobstersbot” is a noun-phrase & is the subject of “Lurking in the channel is” (I think I have that right).
[15:27:20] <ubitux> TIL
[15:27:22] <ignaloidas> it's sentance inversion
[15:27:26] <pja> Yes
[15:28:00] <ignaloidas> the basic structure would be "lobstersbot is a creatively named bot lurking in the channel"
[15:28:28] <ubitux> the more i repeat it, the more my brain accepts it

[20:24:51] <manicennui> What if the data center were in a beautiful national park?
[20:26:00] <JordiGH> c355e3b: Hey, a while ago you mentioned tagging things in S3 for deletion. But I still don't get how that works. If you tag them and then have a deletion policy for deleting things, will the deletion countdown timer start from the moment of tagging or from the moment the S3 file was created?
[20:27:12] <c355e3b> Moment the tag happens
[20:28:14] <c355e3b> The polices can either be key prefix based or tag based
[20:28:39] <c355e3b> When it’s either moved or tagged the clock starts
[20:28:58] <indigo> manicennui: Would the racks be outside?
[20:28:59] <c355e3b> NB: this uses a special delete mechanism that can bypass any rate limiting which is nice
[20:29:20] <manicennui> indigo: Maybe the datacenter would have areas with windows and nice views.

[20:33:45] <JordiGH> Hm, okay, I didn't find the right policy to make it tag-based.
[20:34:58] <indigo> I think the closest national park to me is the Santa Monica Mountains
[20:37:14] <manicennui> The problem with such things here is that they become packed whenever the weather is halfway decent.
[20:37:40] <manicennui> Starved Rock (state park) is amazing, but not very large and always packed with people when the weather is nice.
[20:38:05] <manicennui> When I went to North Carolina, I really liked how many state parks there were, and how few people were in each of them.
[20:38:14] <manicennui> There is a really nice park outside of Durham even.

[21:31:21] <manicennui> The park was Eno River State Park. You should do a bit of research before going because there are a bunch of different trails and places to park.

[23:24:24] <imode> a one line fix is now blocked behind a software guidance campaign.
[23:24:40] <bradfier> Is this related to AWS billing
[23:24:45] <bradfier> because I have experienced AWS billing
[23:24:48] <imode> our regression test data, that we, y'know, use to ensure that things aren't broken when they go out the door, is now a month out of date.
[23:24:50] <bradfier> and I suspect it is non euclidian
[23:24:56] <imode> nope, it's all consumer digital purchases.
[23:25:05] <imode> ebooks, twitch, prime video, digital bundling too.
