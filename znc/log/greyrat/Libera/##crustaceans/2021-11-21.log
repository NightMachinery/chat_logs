[00:04:57] <riv> https://alg.cubing.net/?alg=(R-_U_R-_U_R2)5 found a short order 5 word :)
[00:17:05] <cot> What's up with the rittenhouse acquittal? I've not been following the news about it, but I'm a bit confused why people seem to have already decided that he's guilty (or innocent) prior to his trial. From some very cursory research (reading wikipedia and cnn) he seems to have acted in self defense (to me anyway). Anything I'm missing here?
[00:18:15] <imode> what motivates your idea that he acted in self defense, after bringing an AR-15 to a protest.
[00:19:44] <manicennui> I think most of us believe that it is wrong to get a gun and go to protests to somehow counter them. He likely helped create the situation that led to the shooting.
[00:20:07] <imode> he was hoping for a shooting.
[00:20:09] <manicennui> On the other hand, he might not actually be guilty of a crime (other than the gun charges probably), and the prosecutor seems to have sucked.
[00:20:43] <manicennui> In the end I think most of us are just tired of right wing crazies killing people.
[00:20:48] <manicennui> And want something to get better.
[00:20:56] <gerikson> Wisconsin seems to be kindo of a shithole
[00:21:12] <imode> it is.
[00:21:26] <cot> Hm.

[00:21:30] <buttsbot> Honey, I Joined a Cult on Steam
[00:21:43] <imode> oh god.
[00:22:07] <imode> looks vaguely like rimworld.
[00:22:12] <imode> ..and prison architect.
[00:22:20] <imode> same dudes?
[00:22:22] <manicennui> Definitely a similar type of game.
[00:22:48] <manicennui> I don't think so.
[00:22:51] <imode> oh they published the escapists.
[00:22:55] <cot> True, he seems to be a right-wing gun nut, but still... if a mob starts chasing you calling for your death I dunno if you could be blamed for using the gun at that point. I don't know if he provoked the fight though (if he did, he's definitely guilty).
[00:23:03] *** Joins: jaix (~jaix@user/jaix)
[00:23:20] <manicennui> cot: Had he not gone to another state to be an asshole, it's likely no one would have been shot.
[00:23:39] <imode> yeah he lived 20 miles away.
[00:23:42] <imode> he showed up with an AR-15.
[00:23:45] <imode> and he shot some people.
[00:23:52] <cot> Definitely, I'm not disputing that.
[00:23:58] <imode> he went looking for a fight.
[00:23:59] <manicennui> The aspect that people are unhappy with is that had a black person done the same, they'd likely be in prison.
[00:24:06] <imode> ding!
[00:24:08] <manicennui> The other aspect
[00:24:25] <manicennui> Or shot by the cops.
[00:24:53] <imode> yeah the motivations behind getting this good ol' boy pile of shit on shoes off is so that we can justify killing more people.
[00:25:14] <cot> That a different issue. If Rittenhouse was black and was attacked while not provoking the fight (which, again, I'm not sure about) he's innocent imo.
[00:25:24] <manicennui> They apparently are already spreading the word to arm up and form militias to counter protesters.
[00:25:25] <cot> (Not innocent of being an asshole, but innocent of murder.)
[00:25:42] <imode> yeah because what's the consequence of killing people anymore.
[00:25:56] <imode> just a few celebrity photos, autographs, a rigged trial.
[00:26:07] <imode> fuck anybody defending that walking talking waste of tissue.
[00:26:20] <imode> you wanna be lawful evil, suck my neutral dick.
[00:30:30] <gerikson> nothing good will come of this
[00:30:38] <gerikson> except more murdered and wounded people
[00:32:27] <cot> Jury systems fall apart when the local population is heavily biased.
[00:32:50] <cot> Supposedly neutral jury (but how are you supposed to be neutral when you're submerged in social media?)
[00:33:33] <imode> one wonders what a replacement system would be. judgment by a jury has been a thing for quite a while, but with very little analog for replacement. who's gonna judge you but your community.
[00:34:05] <cot> The jury system failed spectacularly in the scottsboro case.
[00:34:07] <imode> maybe something like a random juror from all 50 states.
[00:34:24] <imode> but that's just logistically impossible.
[00:35:24] <imode> ...though maybe not? I never thought about a remote link.
[00:37:16] <cot> How do you enforce remote attendance?
[00:37:24] <manicennui> I think you are missing the bigger problem.
[00:37:30] <cot> I mean, not that you can't, but seems much harder.
[00:37:34] <manicennui> This type of situation would never happen in a developed country.
[00:37:39] <manicennui> The US is not a developed country.
[00:37:41] <cot> Define "developed".
[00:37:51] <imode> "like finland"
[00:38:38] <manicennui> We'll never make progress on guns though.
[00:38:48] <manicennui> Americans are too deranged.
[00:38:53] <cot> Nah.
[00:38:59] <cot> It'll just take time due to the culture.
[00:39:11] <imode> half the country would rather kill you.
[00:39:14] <cot> A few more generations. Not ideal but "never" is harsh.
[00:39:35] <manicennui> Gun laws have become MORE lax in the last couple decades
[00:39:41] <imode> why is the idea that more generations == better progress. hate, irrationality, mental illness and assholitry can be carried from parent to child.
[00:39:47] <manicennui> After the DC handgun ban was overturned, many other states gave up fighting.
[00:39:52] <cot> And lost, imode.
[00:39:57] <imode> it's growing.
[00:40:07] <cot> Blame facebook.
[00:40:08] <imode> by a wide margin now. either that or we're just around to see more of it.
[00:40:18] <manicennui> Not saying that is the proper solution, but basically nothing can be done because any possible solution is opposed.
[00:40:19] <cot> I think it's more the latter.
[00:40:32] <cot> The proper solution is to nationalize schools.
[00:40:37] <manicennui> I have fairly reasonable generally progressive friends who think they need to carry.
[00:40:41] <cot> Reforms begin at middle school.
[00:40:42] <manicennui> In the fucking suburbs.
[00:40:45] <imode> the proper solution is to nationalize everything.
[00:41:09] <cot> imo that's unfeasible in the US. Would be nice if was proved wrong.
[00:41:17] <cot> s/if/if I/
[00:41:25] <imode> we're opposed to collective effort because tribalism is this neurological virus that's persisted since we lived in caves.
[00:41:40] <imode> on the back of several other neurological viruses.
[00:42:00] <imode> it's not going to be eradicated unless you eradicate the places it lives.
[00:42:02] <manicennui> imode: I think that tribalism can actually be harnessed for good, and is likely part of the reason why some other countries are better off.
[00:42:04] <imode> which is everybody.
[00:42:31] <imode> manicennui: imo that's debatable, unless the whole country is "one tribe".
[00:42:43] <manicennui> I think the other problem is that the US has no real culture or shared values other than consumerism and coveting wealth.
[00:43:01] <imode> I'll disagree with that, there's culture here.
[00:43:15] <cot> But not in the sense that manicennui is saying imo
[00:43:24] <manicennui> imode: The fact that your metro area has a favorite local sandwich isn't culture.
[00:43:31] <cot> ^
[00:43:31] <imode> that's not what I mean.
[00:43:36] <imode> at all.
[00:43:42] <cot> We have founding myths and all that but not in the same way that other countries do.
[00:43:49] <mouseghost> ok $20 an hour dont satisfy me
[00:43:55] <imode> there's culture in small spaces. ways of doing, ways of speaking, ways of learning, local mythology.
[00:44:07] <cot> Why the fuck do I keep saying "we". I'm not american ffs
[00:44:16] <manicennui> imode: Describe one that isn't just religious people being abusive.
[00:45:15] <imode> back where I was from, we used to have celebratory parades when a child turned 5, or when one was born. it was carried down from some of the first settlers in the region, where life was fleeting in many cold seasons.
[00:45:26] <imode> that's culture.
[00:46:45] <imode> we'd have harvest celebrations and dress up as cute-and-weird things and go stomping through town at night while the local harbor master led us with a giiiiant torch.
[00:46:58] <manicennui> Do those things still go on?
[00:47:06] <imode> yep.
[00:47:10] <imode> and boy do I miss them.
[00:47:24] <imode> culture exists in spaces where it's easy to preserve and maintain it.
[00:47:31] <manicennui> Not trying to move the goalposts, but that doesn't really translate outside of that area.
[00:47:36] <imode> that's my point.
[00:47:43] <manicennui> There are no shared values that a big chunk of the US shares.
[00:48:05] <imode> because it's too large to sustain a single monoculture. mexico is the same.
[00:48:13] <imode> brazil is the same.
[00:48:20] <imode> hell germany and france are the same.
[00:48:36] <imode> there is no country that has a single culture within its people.
[00:48:53] <imode> it's often presented that way, because stereotypes are a thing.
[00:48:58] <manicennui> It's not about a single culture. It's about a majority of the population sharing at least a few core values.
[00:49:24] <imode> I don't see any place on earth having that so long as there's other people.
[00:49:28] <imode> that's the problem.
[00:49:39] <manicennui> The most widely shared values in the US are consumerism, corporatism, and white supremacy.
[00:49:40] <cot> The majority of the US shares the core value that America is the last true bastion of democracy in the face of the wave of evil socialists.
[00:49:53] <imode> are either of you american.
[00:50:00] <cot> manicennui, I'd disagree on the white supremacy. Very strongly.
[00:50:01] <imode> I know one of you lives in Chicago.
[00:50:04] <manicennui> And masturbating over the military.
[00:50:09] <imode> why do you think we're like this.
[00:50:11] <manicennui> cot: You'd be wrong.
[00:50:15] <cot> imode, I grew up and reside in the US.
[00:50:27] <imode> so you just walk around hating everyone you meet.
[00:50:32] <cot> manicennui, whites are not a majority.
[00:50:35] <imode> because we're quote unquote "all like this".
[00:50:38] <ex> I'm USian and argue against all you said.
[00:51:04] <imode> the loudest voices maintain the image of a country, unfortunately, but they do not represent the majority.
[00:51:16] <cot> And if you think that whites are a majority in the US, and especially abusive whites, you're living in a bubble.
[00:51:19] <manicennui> cot: Yes they are.
[00:51:22] <cot> jeez.
[00:51:26] * imode sips.
[00:51:29] <ex> imode, I think both sides would agree with you on that.
[00:51:30] <manicennui> Non-Latino whites are 60% of the population still.
[00:51:30] <cot> lol.
[00:51:40] <imode> got facts, m8.
[00:52:09] <ex> manicennui, what does any demographics have to do with your statements?
[00:52:21] <manicennui> ex: cot claimed that whites are not a majority.
[00:52:30] <riv> https://pbfcomics.com/comics/obscenery/
[00:52:30] <buttsbot> Obscenery - The Perry Bible Fellowship
[00:52:31] <imode> his argument is that we share white supremacy as a majority-shared value.
[00:52:39] <imode> which, in short, fuck you, we don't.
[00:52:57] <ex> manicennui, good point, sorry. I keep wondering why the military.
[00:53:13] <manicennui> imode: Majority does not mean everyone.
[00:53:20] <imode> majority means mostly everyone.
[00:53:24] <imode> lmfao.
[00:53:25] <manicennui> And enough of the population is willing to let it happen.
[00:53:27] <cot> lol
[00:53:35] <manicennui> I didn't claim that it didn't.
[00:53:36] <imode> so you consider yourself a white supremacist, then.
[00:53:51] <imode> how many people we talkin', here.
[00:53:53] <manicennui> When you add up people who actively support white supremacy, and people who are fine with letting it happen, it is more than 50%.
[00:54:01] <manicennui> All you have to do is look at our laws.
[00:54:04] <ex> But you can have 99% law abiding people, and 1% racist, hateful people, and only really hear about the 1%.
[00:54:08] <manicennui> And the assholes we keep voting for.
[00:54:36] <ex> manicennui, I think the people who openly support white supremacy in the USA are ostracized by the 99%.
[00:54:36] <manicennui> Even our current Democratic president, and his vice president, are fine with it for the most part.
[00:54:52] * imode sips.
[00:54:56] <imode> go on.
[00:55:09] <manicennui> ex: I think you are defining white supremacy a bit too narrowly.
[00:55:27] <manicennui> I'm not claiming that most whites are out marching in their robes.
[00:55:57] <ex> How does one support it otherwise? Voting, and the people the vote for?
[00:56:00] <manicennui> How many states have laws that disenfranchise non-whites to a large extent?
[00:56:12] <imode> dunno, how many.
[00:56:17] <ex> manicennui, but not by design.
[00:56:28] <manicennui> Of course it is by design.
[00:56:29] <imode> I'd grant most of them are.
[00:56:36] <manicennui> It has been done since emancipation.
[00:56:46] <ex> manicennui, which is the most racist country on Earth?
[00:56:55] <manicennui> ex: I couldn't say.
[00:56:57] <imode> probably the congo.
[00:56:58] <manicennui> It doesn't really matter.
[00:57:05] <cot> India definitely.
[00:57:21] <manicennui> That there is another country that is more racist doesn't mean the US is fine.
[00:57:26] <cot> Though there the racism is so ingrained in the culture it's hard to tell.
[00:57:28] <imode> yeah I'd agree with that.. india is pretty bad.
[00:57:45] <imode> racism and nationalism there are way too intertwined.
[00:57:55] <ex> manicennui, no I was just wondering if you thought it was much higher than most.
[00:57:56] <manicennui> The British no doubt helped exacerbate the racism in India.
[00:57:59] <cot> And from what I can tell it's gotten far, far worse in the last decade with the nationalistic BJP.
[00:58:19] <manicennui> ex: I think it is higher than many developed countries.
[00:58:23] <manicennui> And it could be far bettter.
[00:58:27] <ex> What I hate about the USA is they found something that works great! Busing! But do they do it everywhere? No any more.
[00:58:38] <cot> manicennui, the british were imperialistic bastards but if anything they shit quite a bit on the racism/castism.
[00:58:46] <manicennui> I don't hold any delusions that we will make everyone non-racist.
[00:58:51] <cot> In india, that is. I don't know about elsewhere.
[00:59:11] <imode> we'll just cut off the red belt and let it float.
[00:59:18] <ex> I always wondered if the British were so big on class before India, or if came over.
[00:59:21] <imode> ...and move wisconsin to the moon.
[00:59:24] <manicennui> cot: In many colonized countries skin darkness became something that was focused on.
[00:59:48] <manicennui> With lighter skin being seen as better.
[00:59:50] <imode> actually move michigan to the moon too, my relatives are there.
[01:00:11] <ex> manicennui, Yes it still runs Cuba.
[01:00:50] <cot> manicennui, skin darkness/lightness fetishes didn't necessarily show up with the british.
[01:01:07] <cot> There's a reason brahmins in india were always ultra-light-skinned.
[01:01:18] <ex> cot does sex have that much to do with who runs stuff?
[01:01:23] <cot> Sure there are exceptions but generally speaking
[01:01:38] <cot> ex: Not sure I understand?
[01:02:12] <imode> unrelated. https://www.xda-developers.com/microsoft-edge-buy-now-pay-later/
[01:02:12] <buttsbot> Microsoft Edge has new bloatware that absolutely no one needs
[01:02:20] <imode> who cleared this.
[01:02:37] <ex> We were talking about society, and you used a term I think of as being sexual. I was asking if you were using that way.
[01:02:49] <cot> What term did I use?
[01:02:52] <imode> fetishization.
[01:02:59] <cot> Oh. er no.
[01:03:04] <cot> Didn't mean it that way, sorry.
[01:03:05] <imode> that's not just a term for sex.
[01:03:10] <imode> ...maybe.
[01:03:16] <cot> Yeah but could see how it could be taken in that way.
[01:03:21] <ex> I'm not being a prude, no I am strange. I do live in the USA's 'Bible Belt'.
[01:03:44] <imode> "A fetish is an object believed to have supernatural powers."
[01:03:45] <manicennui> Skin tone prejudice was evident when the British Empire, ruling India at that time, kept light skinned Indians as allies, and gave them extra advantages over the rest of the “blacks.”
[01:03:50] <imode> I have been living my life the wrong way.
[01:04:01] <ex> I enjoyed wondering if what runs sex is what runs society.
[01:04:15] <ex> imode, I never thought of it, but I have used both words!
[01:04:18] <manicennui> It didn't start with the British, but they definitely exacerbated it.
[01:04:23] <imode> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetishism
[01:04:23] <buttsbot> Fetishism - Wikipedia
[01:04:26] <imode> wow.
[01:04:41] <imode> I didn't know the root until today, wild.
[01:05:03] <cot> manicennui, british customs wouldn't have made a dent in the very heavily ingrained caste system in india.
[01:05:05] <ex> I knew it but did not put it together.
[01:05:27] <cot> IMO they just went along with whoever they saw as the local aristocrats.
[01:05:36] <imode> yeah castes were loooooooooooong established prior to colonialization.
[01:05:56] <ex> It would be a lot more work if you had to rebuild all of government.
[01:06:10] <cot> This is heresy I know, but british rule wasn't totally bad for india.
[01:06:53] <ex> I wonder why some British stuff took off in Hong Kong, but not India.
[01:06:56] <cot> They established schools, hospitals, etc, and helped bring in a culture that was amenable to stopping abusive practices. I'm not justifying british crimes though.
[01:08:08] <manicennui> https://i.redd.it/if4cfnp9es081.jpg
[01:08:56] <cot> Heh.
[01:09:02] <cot> Where was that? Facebook?
[01:09:07] <imode> twitter.
[01:09:21] <cot> Oh
[01:10:07] <manicennui> I think our only hope is to be invaded by aliens.
[01:10:19] <riv> putting all my eggs in that basket
[01:10:27] <cot> Same lol
[01:10:58] <manicennui> Or for Jesus to return and take his cult members with him.
[01:11:07] <imode> if jesus returns I'm going with him, that dude can do some shit.
[01:11:16] <imode> infiniwine.
[01:11:41] <imode> pascal's gambit I think that one is.
[01:11:53] <riv> 2021 jesus can turn C into rust
[01:12:20] <manicennui> He might be an asshole who prefers C or something.
[01:12:34] <manicennui> I'll only follow him if he is into lisp.
[01:12:37] <imode> what if he's not ana sshole but still prefers C.
[01:12:40] <cot> imode: pascals wager
[01:12:47] <manicennui> imode: Is that possible?
[01:12:52] <imode> cot: gambit, wager, I'm betting it on black.
[01:13:03] <imode> manicennui: it is!
[01:13:13] <cot> I like C. Fite me.
[01:13:14] <imode> people do exist that aren't assholes and prefer C!
[01:13:25] <manicennui> Lies.
[01:13:33] <imode> is this a black swan situation for you.
[01:13:41] <riv> jesus likes pascal?
[01:13:53] <imode> that would be a twist.
[01:13:56] <manicennui> Plus, I'd rather follow a more badass god.
[01:14:25] <cot> Allah's for you then.
[01:14:33] <cot> Eternal jihad against the C lovers.
[01:14:33] <manicennui> Like Swampthing.
[01:14:36] <imode> we should all play Smite.
[01:15:04] <imode> funny how jesus isn't available in that game.
[01:15:11] <imode> I'd play as jesus. dude had hetfield hair.
[01:15:13] <manicennui> There is even a Swampthing story line where he tries to wipe out humanity and the silly "heroes" stop him.
[01:15:47] <manicennui> Swamp Thing
[01:16:16] <imode> the only true religion is pastafarianism.
[01:16:41] <manicennui> In case you want to dive deeper into Swamp Thing mythology: https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/The_Green
[01:16:41] <buttsbot> The Green | DC Database | Fandom
[01:16:52] <manicennui> He isn't just some grotesque living in the swamp.
[01:17:12] <imode> it'd be cooler if he was.
[01:17:30] <imode> like worshipping ol' greg.
[01:17:34] <manicennui> Swamp Thing and Poison Ivy are my heroes.
[01:17:49] <imode> fuzzy little man peach.
[01:18:30] <manicennui> "The Swamp Thing went on a rampage in Star City, ultimately seeking to destroy all life on Earth. The Entity within the White Lantern used several heroes, including Hawkman, Hawkgirl, Firestorm, the Martian Manhunter, Aquaman and Deadman to slow the rampage and to construct a new Swamp Thing based on the body of Alec Holland. Instead of merely thinking that it was Holland, this version of the Swamp Thing would actually be him. The
[01:18:30] <manicennui> new Swamp Thing defeated and killed the corrupted and original Swamp Thing."
[01:19:21] <manicennui> "The book ended with the Swamp Thing killing several businessmen who engaged in deliberate, illegal polluting activities."
[01:19:21] <manicennui> hah
[01:20:28] <manicennui> DC could do a really incredible movie where Swamp Thing and Poison Ivy attempt to save the planet by destroying humanity and presenting a really nuanced conflicted view about the righteousness of such a thing.
[01:20:58] <manicennui> But they'd fuck it up with some feel good bullshit about some human doing something good one time which somehow justifies everything.
[01:21:18] <imode> do you plan on killing yourself, manicennui.
[01:21:23] <manicennui> I've not seen many movies or fiction do a good job of justifying humanity.
[01:21:24] <imode> or having kids.
[01:21:26] <manicennui> imode: No.
[01:21:27] <imode> morbidly curious.
[01:21:31] <manicennui> And no.
[01:21:48] <imode> that'd directly further their goals, though.
[01:22:33] <manicennui> Whose goals?
[01:22:49] <imode> swamp thing and poison ivy.
[01:22:58] <manicennui> They are fictional.
[01:23:06] <imode> and they're your heroes.
[01:23:12] <manicennui> It was a joke.
[01:23:16] <imode> sure it was.
[01:23:23] <manicennui> I do think some really nuanced stories could be told from that angle.
[01:23:29] <manicennui> But super hero stuff has to be dumb.
[01:23:34] <imode> stay true to your convictions and promote global suicide.
[01:23:44] <imode> rid the earth of this menacing plague!
[01:23:53] <manicennui> Can't have villains with complex and nuanced motivations.
[01:23:55] <cot> imode, weren't you the eco-fascist who suggested killing a few thousand people to save a few trees?
[01:24:07] <imode> cot: was I?
[01:24:18] <cot> Yes? It's possible I'm misremembering. Let me check.
[01:24:29] <imode> if so it's probably accurate, yeah.
[01:24:44] <manicennui> imode: At most I will exist for a few more decades. Everything can ceases to exist after that for all I care.
[01:25:02] <manicennui> can cease
[01:25:40] <manicennui> I do not expect humans to change course and save themselves.
[01:25:45] <manicennui> But I'm also not sad about it.
[01:25:53] <manicennui> It is what it is.
[01:26:11] <imode> shit hand me a rifle and we'll do it now man let's go.
[01:26:20] <manicennui> Okay Kyle.
[01:26:22] <imode> - unironically the attitude of some people.
[01:26:26] <imode> yeah lmfaooo.
[01:26:53] <cot> > I wouldn't really bat an eye if we were reduced to 1/4th of the current population.
[01:26:56] <manicennui> I'll live out my days in my A-frame and tune the rest of you out.
[01:27:00] <cot> Make that a few billion...
[01:27:06] <imode> still wouldn't.
[01:27:08] <manicennui> I agree with that sentiment.
[01:27:31] <imode> eco-fascist otherwise known as "we can't support this anymore and death is acceptable, even if it's my own".
[01:27:35] <manicennui> The thing is, that 1/4 would be far better off.
[01:27:40] <cot> o_O
[01:27:52] <imode> if I had the lever I'd pull it.
[01:28:05] <manicennui> My death is obviously unacceptable.
[01:28:08] <imode> thanos me, baybeh.
[01:28:17] <imode> see that's where thanos was weak.
[01:28:18] <cot> Better kill off all the Indians and Africans first. They reproduce too much.
[01:28:20] <manicennui> imode: What if there was a chance that you'd be one of them?
[01:28:28] <imode> dude should've included himself in the lottery.
[01:28:32] <imode> if he was committed to the cause.
[01:28:34] <manicennui> Why?
[01:28:43] <manicennui> Why care what happens if you don't exist?
[01:28:47] <manicennui> It's pointless.
[01:28:48] <imode> because otherwise you genuinely take a privelaged position as "decider of the universe".
[01:29:06] <manicennui> That is kind of the point though, isn't it?
[01:29:11] <manicennui> To make one's life better?
[01:29:27] <imode> if I wanted to make my life better I'd enslave everyone.
[01:29:28] <manicennui> I could almost understand it if you had children and wanted to make things better for them.
[01:29:42] <imode> it's almost like you can care for the collective without focusing on the individual.
[01:29:58] <manicennui> But why make things better in a world where you don't exist?
[01:30:02] *** Quits: jaix (~jaix@user/jaix) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[01:30:12] <manicennui> imode: I care in my own way.
[01:30:13] <imode> maybe because I care about things other than me existing.
[01:30:22] <imode> or rather, the me that exists.
[01:30:24] <manicennui> I think there are better and worse ways to run a society.
[01:30:31] <manicennui> And we should try to be just.
[01:30:32] <imode> "I don't care about what happens after me" is how we got here.
[01:30:37] <manicennui> But I also don't think human life is special.
[01:30:41] <imode> so take yours.
[01:30:51] <manicennui> Obviously I want to live.
[01:30:55] <imode> but it's not special.
[01:30:58] <manicennui> I think that line of debate is just lazy.
[01:31:08] <manicennui> You know that most beings want to survive.
[01:31:18] <imode> they have an impetus to, sure.
[01:31:26] <manicennui> It is possible to want to survive and want a better life and not care about ever other life.
[01:31:34] <manicennui> s/ever/every/
[01:31:43] <imode> yeah, welcome to the modern era.
[01:31:46] <manicennui> And even want those who are alive to have better lives.
[01:31:53] <imode> why do you care about kyle rittenhouse, then.
[01:31:59] <imode> or like, literally every other environmental catastrophy.
[01:32:00] <manicennui> Because he makes life worse.
[01:32:06] <imode> he doesn't make _your life worse_.
[01:32:12] <imode> he does not impact _you_.
[01:32:16] <manicennui> He does though.
[01:32:17] <imode> none of this impacts _you_.
[01:32:24] <imode> or _me_.
[01:32:36] <manicennui> I want to live among healthy, intelligent, educated people who are happy and don't have to worry about being killed by crazies.
[01:32:53] <imode> that conflicts with "not caring about other life".
[01:33:02] <manicennui> And I think we have a better chance of achieving this with fewer of us.
[01:33:21] <imode> because by direction _you do care about others_.
[01:33:30] <manicennui> imode: Think about it this way...
[01:33:32] <imode> because you care about living among a certain type of people.
[01:33:35] <manicennui> You really care about cats.
[01:33:42] <manicennui> And you try to help as many of them as you can.
[01:33:50] <manicennui> But you obviously favor certain cats.
[01:33:57] <manicennui> And you can't take care of an infinite number of them.
[01:34:04] <imode> lord knows I wish I could!
[01:34:20] <manicennui> I rather that there were fewer cats.
[01:34:24] <imode> but I'm stull hung up on "and not care about ever other life"
[01:34:44] <imode> because everything you're saying just contradicts that outright.
[01:34:46] <manicennui> If I could snap my fingers and neuter/spay all stray cats, I would.
[01:35:03] <manicennui> imode: It's not a simple position, and I don't think I could explain it well.
[01:35:15] <imode> yeah I think it's just that it's inconsistent you have a hard time explaining it at all.
[01:35:18] <imode> either way it's lunch time.
[01:35:35] <imode> you won't interrupt me and my soup.
[01:35:47] <imode> o/
[01:36:02] <manicennui> It only seems inconsistent because you believe that it is all or nothing.
[01:36:27] <imode> whatever makes you sleep at night.
[01:36:56] <manicennui> The fact that I have virtually no control over any of it helps me sleep.
[01:37:28] <cot> what kind of soup imode
[01:37:33] <manicennui> I couldn't change it if I wanted to, and if I could, I'd put far more thought into it.

[06:20:35] <manicennui> Whippersnapper!
[06:20:50] <imode> yep, wide-eyed and hungry for adventure.
[06:21:52] <imode> for me that movie is a moment in time. it filled me with equal parts hope and dread.
[06:22:02] <imode> such high amounts.
[06:22:33] <manicennui> I can't believe that was 7 years ago...
[06:22:35] <imode> the idea that we could be a space-faring race in my lifetime was a very real one.
[06:22:53] <imode> there was still some hope that I had.
[06:23:04] <imode> dreamt of life aboard world ships.
[06:23:21] <manicennui> Maybe we'll visit the moon again within our lifetimes.
[06:23:41] <imode> that dream died a while ago.

[06:25:51] <imode> that built up to the fade-out on cornfield chase always represents, to me, the reaching up of a hand to the stars, only to fall back down to earth in silence.
[06:26:09] <imode> we've done that.
[06:27:36] <manicennui> Again, our best bet is an alien invasion.
[06:27:47] <imode> which will never happen.
[06:27:51] <manicennui> Maybe they'll let some of us survive and show us some shit.
[06:28:02] <manicennui> Like taking your dog for a ride in the car.
[06:28:57] <imode> I remember feeling that longing desperation of realizing "we're not making it off the rock". I think the next thing I did was dig into material science to find something that could withstand the forces of "space" for the next 2-3 billion years that I could sketch things on to.
[06:29:08] <imode> eventually I accepted that all things are transient, but the will was there.
[06:29:36] <manicennui> I don't understand the desire to explore space.
[06:29:52] <manicennui> There is so much here on Earth.
[06:30:16] <manicennui> I think it is about somehow escaping our problems.
[06:30:23] <manicennui> As if we won't just create them everywhere we go.
[06:30:35] <imode> there's an immense set of worlds out there that are incredibly interesting from a scientific point of view, several of them good planets. but.. yeah, we can't figure things out here, what makes us think we'll figure things out there.
[06:30:45] <manicennui> And with limited resources in the rest of the solar system, things will be far worse.
[06:31:06] <manicennui> We'll just kill each other wherever we go.
[06:31:13] <imode> and hey, if the universe has the right boundary conditions, several "alternative histories" could've been played out already.
[06:31:59] <manicennui> Ignoring the protomolecule, a lot of The Expanse seems plausible.
[06:32:05] <manicennui> And none of it seems desirable.

[20:07:43] <riv> speaking of
[20:07:50] <riv> did you see this bullshit remake of GTA 3 4 5
[20:07:57] <riv> or 3, SA, VC i guess
[20:08:16] <riv> so annoying
[20:08:17] <imode> yeah that was fun to watch. especially considering the sources were present in the deployed builds, and that the originals were delisted.
[20:08:38] <imode> all of that work fighting reverse engineering efforts.
[20:09:12] <riv> that makes me mad
[20:09:34] <imode> I'm thankful I'm not a GTA fan.
[20:09:45] <imode> but I am a metroid fan and we've been getting fucked since '10.
[20:09:48] <defect> i think they announced that the originals are coming back and anyone who bought the remakes gets them for free, so that's something at least
[20:10:10] <imode> they hired a mobile dev to do the "remaster".
[20:10:17] <imode> which I think is hilarious.
[20:13:00] <defect> i'm hoping they realize the mistake, put a couple of rockstar devs on it and patch it up
[20:13:05] <defect> a guy can dream right?
[20:13:26] <imode> dream away, that ain't happening.
[20:15:58] <riv> whats the point though
[20:16:07] <riv> the originals already exist
[20:16:17] <riv> nobody asked for them to be remade
[20:16:32] <riv> it doesn't make any sense, what a waste of energy
[20:17:03] <imode> remakes/remasters can breathe new life into an aging game, especially ones like SA, VC, etc.
[20:17:43] <defect> i found the originals to be pretty hard to play on console in 2021 to be honest. weird aiming, movement etc.
[20:18:38] <riv> fair point
[20:22:21] <imode> I do not understand why the MNT Reform has the design that it does. you can build a fucking battery carrier and lessen the overall thickness of the thing.
[20:23:19] <indigo> Anyone planning on doing AoC this year?
[20:23:31] <imode> that, and what the hell is that _trackball_
[20:23:40] <riv> i might do the first few in rust, ive been really keen to learn rust
[20:23:40] <edk> imode: well, i've been asking for thick laptops for years
[20:24:04] <imode> as have I.
[20:24:06] <edk> it's not just the battery volume that's impacted by current levels of laptop thinness, it's the thermal performance too
[20:24:36] <imode> I run on a refurb'd T430 and I love the chonkiness. it's thick enough to be repairable and thin enough to not be a burden in the hand.
[20:24:43] <imode> chonk is good.
[20:24:53] <edk> it's just a shame that everything else about the mnt reform is terrible i guess

[21:59:49] <indigo> I like Peter Norvig’s solutions
[22:12:11] <imode> how're scheme's types stored?
[22:14:40] <riv> what do you mean?
[22:14:49] <riv> data is tagged so you know what type it is
[22:15:09] <imode> yeah but how are the tags stored.
[22:15:12] <imode> what's the format.
[22:15:33] <riv> https://rain-1.github.io/scheme-7
[22:15:34] <buttsbot> Lessons from Tarot 7 - pointer tagging and data representation. | rain-1.github.io
[22:16:15] <imode> I see. so what about, say, "type descriptors" for structs.
[22:16:35] <riv> you'd need an extensible table for structures - since new structures can be defined
[22:16:36] <imode> i.e user defined types, or as close as you can get with them.
[22:16:39] <imode> yeah.
[22:17:08] <imode> "The type descriptor satisfies the predicate record-type?."
[22:17:40] <riv> yeah so a record type would have the record tag and then a second tag inside it, explaining which record type it is
[22:18:14] <imode> "I am a record, here's which record I am."
[22:18:18] <imode> yeah that sounds about right.
[22:18:37] <imode> how would you switch based on the record types in a function.
[22:18:45] <imode> I assume "get the record type, do equality check".
[22:20:14] <imode> so all records are formatted in some form, but they always have an implicit tag and some constructors/accessors/modifiers.
[22:20:58] <riv> wow i watched a film and it ended very abruptly and im quite disappointed. was a decent enjoyable film but i felt like it was just about half way through in terms of story :/
[22:22:03] <riv> well when you define a record type in scheme, in the scheme host you get a bunch of functions including a record predicate, that lets you check if something is of that record type https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-9/srfi-9.html
[22:22:03] <buttsbot> SRFI 9: Defining Record Types
[22:22:56] <riv> in terms of implementation you can treat them all uniformly in terms of the table of record types - but that sort of stuff isn't exposed to the scheme host - although you could expose it under some API and allow metaprogramming over all records
[22:23:26] <riv> https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/lkowv3/lapsis_can_someone_help_me_understand/ not the only one who thought this
[22:23:26] <buttsbot> Lapsis? Can someone help me understand... : movies
[22:23:30] <imode> I see.. was wondering about that, the ability to dig into a record generically.
[22:24:22] <riv> I've never seen any generic way to do that sort of thing
[22:24:27] <riv> but like
[22:24:34] <riv> a record is just a fixed length vector
[22:24:37] <imode> yeah.
[22:24:58] <riv> they're only special in that they aren't the same type as anything else
[22:29:04] <imode> the reason I ask is that I need to do some runtime type encoding for FV3, and I was wondering how "the rest of the world" did it.
[22:29:19] <imode> scheme/lisp seemed pretty natural considering they tag their stuff, like I have to.
[22:30:09] <companion_cube> riv: are records stored in lists? or actual blocks with constant access?
[22:30:54] <riv> yes arrays rather than lists (which we call vectors in scheme world)
[22:31:46] <companion_cube> nice.
[22:31:46] <imode> I can only do linear access, so..
[22:33:09] <imode> when you invoke `+`, I have to know you're not trying to add a Bit and an Int8 together.

[22:36:16] <imode> "yet if I ship my software to Linux users with a BSD makefile and tell them to install BSD make, there will hardly be a person who wouldn’t scorn at the idea."
[22:36:56] <imode> I agree with this. you ship something that's relies on a tool that's not generally available, you'll not get adoption.
[22:37:08] <imode> especially when it's a tool that's "basic" as make.
[22:37:49] <imode> so the anger of "why doesn't this work" shifts to "you deliberately made this not work, I blame you for literally every inconsistency between these two tools because you reminded me that those inconsistencies exist".

[23:35:42] <dminkovsky> does anyone know how to change the text underneath your discord avatar? i have it set to something and don't know what it's called or how to remove it
[23:36:42] <dminkovsky> https://i.imgur.com/BXkXl5e.png
[23:42:44] <drakonis> ah so you're pony's author, neat.
[23:42:50] <manicennui> OMG
[23:42:56] <drakonis> also white background
[23:42:57] <manicennui> Dmitry pics
[23:42:58] <drakonis> whyyy
[23:43:13] <drakonis> what kind of monster uses discord on light mode
[23:43:40] <drakonis> the dminkovsky the answer is to click on your status
[23:44:18] <drakonis> on the bottom left, you can set your custom status
[23:44:34] <drakonis> online/idle/busy/offline/custom status
[23:47:07] <dminkovsky> manicennui: i have to be a public person now :/
[23:47:27] <dminkovsky> i already had to kick/ban someone from discord and now i'm afraid they're going to come to my house and shoot me
[23:48:09] <manicennui> That is how we solve problems in the US.
[23:48:20] <dminkovsky> drakonis: light mode sucks but i can't do dark mode outside the terminal for some reason
[23:48:34] <drakonis> how though
[23:48:57] <dminkovsky> drakonis: ohhh that's a custom status wild
[23:49:10] <dminkovsky> drakonis: i don't know
[23:49:11] <drakonis> settings -> appearance
[23:49:16] <drakonis> theme
[23:49:25] <drakonis> its set to be based on the system colors, isnt it
[23:49:33] <manicennui> https://grmdaily.com/adele-spotify-shuffle-button-removed/
[23:49:33] <buttsbot> Adele gets Spotify to remove the shuffle button from album pages
[23:51:12] <manicennui> I'm off for a week. I should do something.
[23:52:05] <drakonis> dminkovsky: the internet ruins everything, doesnt it?
[23:52:20] <dminkovsky> drakonis: i don't use dark mode expect arbitrarily in VSCode
[23:52:25] <dminkovsky> and the terminal
[23:52:28] <drakonis> oh
[23:52:30] <dminkovsky> i use intellij light mode
[23:52:30] <drakonis> uhhh
[23:52:36] <drakonis> i'm confused now
[23:52:44] <dminkovsky> it's kind of horrible and jarring going back and forth
[23:52:53] <dminkovsky> but i don't know how dark mode ppl use dark mode
[23:52:57] <dminkovsky> it looks kind of crazy
[23:53:32] <dminkovsky> but okay actually i did it :)
[23:53:42] <dminkovsky> it's quite in discord actually
[23:53:54] <dminkovsky> maybe i'm just making stuff up
[23:54:41] <dminkovsky> if we're doing discord troubleshooting, is there a way to disable those animations when people join. not for everyone but just for me.
[23:54:57] <dminkovsky> i was trying to do something yesterday and they were using up all my cpu
[23:55:49] <dminkovsky> lol no yeah drakonis you're right dark mode is much better
[23:56:21] <drakonis> which animations?
[23:56:53] <drakonis> oh
[23:56:54] <drakonis> right
[23:57:03] <dminkovsky> like these avatar ceature things waving when someone joins
[23:57:48] <drakonis> yes you can
[23:58:29] <drakonis> go on server settings and disable the automated messages for prompting members to welcome people
[23:58:40] <drakonis> so they wont have the button to instantly post one of these
[23:58:41] <dminkovsky> oh then it'll just stop cool
[23:59:00] <drakonis> yes
[23:59:43] <gerikson> ``I think for most adults with family responsibilities and full time jobs (and likely a range of side projects that also need attention)''
[23:59:45] <dminkovsky> oh cool. i'll look through all these settings now more closely
