[23:32:25] <duds-> how fix ;w;
[23:32:26] <duds-> trying 2 use dis https://ruby-rbot.org/
[23:32:41] <newton> it's obsolete but still works
[23:32:48] <newton> but I think CGI.escape is preferred now?
[23:33:17] <weaksauce> i remember looking at them and they didn't behave identical 
[23:33:30] <duds-> oh does it?
[23:33:30] <duds-> weird bc it says that but doesn't return a result when running a command
[23:33:36] <duds-> maybe it's the permissions then
[23:33:49] <newton> still works is probably based off the ruby version tbh it doesn't look like URI.escape is in ruby 3
[23:34:13] <duds-> i'm on ruby 2.7.x
[23:34:54] <newton> also yeah weaksauce -- the output is different
[23:34:58] <duds-> ruby 2.7.0p0 to be exact
[23:35:22] <newton> so if you upgrade it'll stop working but otherwise it's just warning you it's deprecated
[23:35:28] <weaksauce> which i'm not sure how they can consider that to be a drop in replacement for then
[23:35:28] <duds-> alright
[23:35:35] <duds-> must be permissions then
[23:35:57] <newton> permissions?
[23:36:42] <duds-> yeah, rbot permissions, which is what i'm trying to run
[23:37:05] <newton> weaksauce, I think the context it's used in is what matters and if it's a viable drop-in
[23:37:22] <duds-> so not really related to ruby itself then but the program
[23:37:31] <newton> duds-, the warning is from ruby, not rbot
[23:37:40] <newton> rbot is using URI.escape and ruby is just telling you it's deprecated
[23:38:36] <duds-> yeah, but it's not an error; i thought the warning was why it wasn't working, but if it still works despite it, the problem must be on rbot's side (my permissions config)
[23:38:36] <duds-> thx
[23:38:49] <newton> ah. np
