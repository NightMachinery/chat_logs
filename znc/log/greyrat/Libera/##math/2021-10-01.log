[03:12:09] <mawk> actually it's false
[03:12:16] <mawk> partial derivatives existing isn't enough for the function to exist

[03:14:07] <mawk> I don't remember it exactly but it involves having partial derivatives that are not continuous at zero, and when you compute the differential you get nonsense

[03:15:51] <mawk> f is differentiable means you can write it as df = ∂_xf dx + ∂_yf dy + o(||(x; y)||)
[03:16:19] <mawk> I guess continuity of partial derivatives is what ensures the o term is actually a o

[04:44:05] <tusko> qed
[04:44:13] <qergle> do you know why 2^6 can't be?
[04:44:27] <tusko> 6 has common factor 2 with 10
[04:44:36] <qergle> the order of 2^6 = 10/gcd(6,10) = 5
[04:44:52] <qergle> right, you want exponents that are coprime to 10
[04:45:26] <qergle> which are 1,3,7,9
[04:45:56] <tusko> Is there any significance to the use of 2^k where k is in {1,3,7,9} surely 2 is not alwyas a primitive root
[04:46:06] <qergle> correct it isn't always
[04:46:25] <qergle> then you use one that is
[04:46:29] <tusko> So we require to first find some generator before we can use this trick?
[04:46:39] <Z-module> We believe it is for infinitely many primes p, but still haven't actually proven that

[05:15:41] <DaPinkOne> I'm trying to figure out these problems in discrete logic, putting problems like "That it is below freezing is necessary and sufficient
[05:15:41] <DaPinkOne>  for it to be snowing."  into p-> q form, but I can't seem to get straight which should be p or q in this relationship
[05:16:08] <qergle> necessary & sufficient is a biconditional
[05:16:14] <qergle> do you know how those look?
[05:16:17] <DaPinkOne> I seem to have it right for "if...then...", but the "necessary..." types confuse me
[05:16:29] <Baguette> Scrap it
[05:16:43] <qergle> "p is necessary and sufficient for q" is p <--> q
[05:16:56] <Baguette> you sure
[05:17:09] <Baguette> if p then q is p --> q
[05:17:16] <Baguette> if and only if is <-->
[05:17:36] <Baguette> If that was the case, it would be p and q are necessary and sufficient for eachother
[05:17:40] <qergle> necessary & sufficient is another way to say if and only if.
[05:18:45] <qergle> but it's a flawed statement. "That it is below freezing is necessary and sufficient for it to be snowing."
[05:19:08] <qergle> many of you have probably been in below-freezing temperatures and it wasn't snowing.
[05:19:54] <qergle> ergo, it's not sufficient
[05:19:55] <Baguette> Yes, so not <-->
[05:20:08] <Baguette> If it is snowing, then it must be below freezing
[05:20:29] <Baguette> Snowing is p, below freezing is 1
[05:20:32] <Baguette> *q
[05:20:33] <qergle> that's something else, whether the actual statement is true
[05:20:54] <qergle> before we were addressing the equivalence of "necessary & sufficient" and "if and only if"
[05:20:55] <PlanckWalk> Below freezing is necessary for snowing, p -> q
[05:21:05] <Baguette> thank you
[05:21:35] <PlanckWalk> (Or in alternative notation,  q <- p)
[05:21:54] <qergle> so, if DaPinkOne wished to put "That it is below freezing is necessary and sufficient for it to be snowing." in "p and q form" it would be "freezing <-> snowing"
[05:22:38] <Baguette> If it is freezing, then it is not necessarily snowing
[05:22:56] <Baguette> snowing --> freezing
[05:23:16] <PlanckWalk> (Though really, necessity is more reasonably expressed in terms of modal logic)
[05:26:03] <DaPinkOne> qergle, you're right that it's a bidirectional. I made a typo there. if p = "it is below freezing", and q = "it is snowing", how do you determine which goes first?
[05:26:16] <DaPinkOne> ...does it make a difference for a bidirectional?
[05:26:31] <Baguette> Okay, so P⟺Q
[05:26:41] <qergle> DaPinkOne: makes no difference
[05:26:45] <Baguette> Maybe we change it to other ways to represent it

[05:30:32] <PlanckWalk> Usually  <->  just means material conditional.  If it is snowing and it is below freezing then  p <-> q  holds, even if it isn't true that snowing and freezing always occur together.
[05:30:51] <PlanckWalk> (p <-> q  also holds if it is neither snowing nor below freezing)

[06:44:14] <biberao> my confusion is in this case the coefficient stays the same even though (b^2)^2?

[09:22:31] <Galois> the issue with old style computer based proofs is that it introduces more points of error without alleviating any.
[09:22:51] <Galois> you have to check the program is correct. you have to check it does what it says it does. you have to check that it's not missing anything.

[09:23:59] <Galois> but when the computer checks the proof itself, you only have to check one thing: that the computer checks proofs correctly. No "understanding" is required. Checking is a mechanical process.
[09:24:34] <Galois> furthermore, if everyone uses ths same proof checker (not true today, but there is a path to getting there), then everyone only needs to check one thing.
[09:25:00] <cherim> By old style you mean just trusting some coded algorithms, unique for each problem? Sure, there are a lot of "we recomputed this piece of prospective projective planes of order 10, got different counts, we also found a error in the previous program, wrong use of a loop ariable"
[09:25:45] <cherim> What I say about tradition is applicable to machine-checkable proofs as well, where there is no argument about correctness of code
[09:26:06] <Galois> tradition is dead wrong in conflating the two situations
[09:27:21] <Galois> every mathematician knows, from birth: the way to gain confidence in your mathematical system is to use it, and observe a consistent pattern of correct behavior.
[09:27:37] <Galois> we can't prove ZFC is consistent, but we use it, over and over again, and observe that it works
[09:28:07] <Galois> ok, now let's apply this to "computer proofs". Situation 1: write one-off code for every proof that you have to check from scratch.
[09:28:28] <Galois> Situation 2: Use one proof assistant for all your math, that everyone can use and check repeatedly
[09:29:34] <greenbagels> i think you're reading too literally into it
[09:29:53] <greenbagels> i dont know if someone would actually claim "this computer-assisted proof that 1+1 < 2+2 is invalid"
[09:30:00] <greenbagels> "by the sheer virtue of being a computer-assisted proof"

[10:16:02] <rubiksdream> hi, this is likely an easy problem but im not able to solve it, suppose D is a region of the complex plane, and let a chain in the region be a formal sum of piecewise-C^1 paths in the region, where we identify chains by replacing p_1 + ... + p_k with p_1 * ... * p_k (i.e. the concatenation of paths, if this makes sense i.e. the paths are coincident), we can identify (-p) with p^{-} (the path parameterized 'backwards'), we can permute the summands
[10:16:02] <rubiksdream> freely, and we combine all of this into an equivalence relation
[10:17:22] <rubiksdream> now I want to show the following fact that I think is intuitively obvious but im a little too brain fried to see how to make a formal proof: a chain is a cycle if the boundary operator (defined in the obvious way) on it is zero, show that if p_1 + ... + p_k is a cycle, then there is a permutation of {1,...,k}, sigma, s.t. p_{sigma(1)} ,...,p_{sigma(k)} are coincident paths, and p_{sigma(k)}'s endpoint is the initial point of p_{sigma(1)}
[10:18:15] <rubiksdream> to those combinatorially minded folk im guessing this fact should be pretty obvious
[10:18:20] <isekaijin> rubiksdream: So a disjoint union of cycles is not a cycle?
[10:18:25] <[-_-]> is this correct? int f''(x) dx = f'(x) ?
[10:18:54] <rubiksdream> isekaijin, oh maybe I misspoke, well you mean a disjoint union of closed curves or?

[10:19:14] <rubiksdream> isekaijin, cycles are just chains (Formal sums of paths) with zero boundary
[10:19:16] <isekaijin> rubiksdream: Yes. A disjoint union of closed curves.
[10:19:17] <cherim> It's a graph problem essentially? Have a multi-digraph, every vertex has indegree equal to out degree, then there exists an Eulerian cycle. Indeed needs connectedness
[10:19:34] <rubiksdream> isekaijin,  so if you represent the disjoint union of closed curves c_i via c_1 + ... + c_p, boundary operator applied to it yields 0 + ... + 0
[10:19:40] <rubiksdream> since boundary(c_j) = 0 for any closed curve c_j

[11:48:26] <cherim> You can skip this and do induction on the number of curves, say

[12:32:45] <rubiksdream> since one can only go from one representation to another by a sequence of simple moves, rearranging summands, changing the negative of a path to the opposite path, reparameterizing a path, fusing coincident paths into the concatenation of such paths
[12:33:18] <rubiksdream> his claim is rather easy to prove (just induct on the sequence of moves required to go from some representation to the representation as a sum of closed curves)

[14:12:50] <lessshaste> PlanckWalk, can you explain more?
[14:14:00] <PlanckWalk> Chebyshev's inequality puts an upper bound on frequency of observations outside some multiple of the stdev
[14:14:52] <PlanckWalk> So you could almost-sorta-vaguely put that "muliple of stdev" as the constant in the O() class.

[18:14:14] <somiaj> [itchyjunk]: you can't transform all of R^n to R^m, but there are lots of transforms between R^n and R^m, the image of the transform just as dimension <= m
[18:14:33] <riv> there are linear maps frmo R^m -> R^n for all n,m
[18:14:39] <riv> e.g. f(x) = 0
[18:15:07] <[itchyjunk]> hmm i don't grasp why the rank must stay the same or reduce then
[18:15:42] <somiaj> because if you have R^n -> R^m -> R^k, the first transform's rank is <= n, the second transform rank is <= rank of the first transform
[18:15:55] <somiaj> since each transform cannot increase the dimension, only keep it the same or decrease it
[18:16:04] <riv> rank of what?
[18:16:15] <somiaj> the matrix that represents the transform
[18:16:26] <[itchyjunk]> but but why? if there are linear maps from R^m to R^n for all m and n
[18:16:33] <[itchyjunk]> then i have it for n > m's too
[18:17:21] <somiaj> [itchyjunk]: because the rank of the map is <= the dimension of its domain
[18:17:38] <[itchyjunk]> i guess i don't understand the why of that
[18:17:39] <riv> imagine a cube, R^3, a linear transform can skew it, rotate it, flatten it down to 2D but it can never make it into a 4D cube
[18:17:42] <somiaj> it isn't about the dimension of the codomain, it is about the dimension of the image, which is always <= the dimension of the domian

[18:18:22] <[itchyjunk]> just by def of what linear transform is, it would just be what you said it seems?
[18:19:23] <somiaj> Correct, if b1,b2,...,bn is a basis for the domain, then all vectors are v = a1 b1 + a2 b2 + ... + an bn
[18:19:47] <somiaj> thus the image of all vectors is T(v) = T(a1 b1 + ... + an bn) = a1 T(b1) + a2 T(b2) + ... + an T(bn)
[18:20:13] <somiaj> now T(b1),T(b2),...,T(bn) may or may not be linearly independent, but still this shows that the dimension of the image is <= n
[18:20:50] <somiaj> since a basis of the image is a subset of {T(b1),T(b2),...,T(bn)} depending what you need to get a maximum sized subset that is linearlly independnet.

[18:23:57] <somiaj> dila: it really depends on the transform, the best you can say in general is the rank is = dimension of the image <= dimension of the domian.
[18:24:40] <dila> when i first thought of it i even wondered if the set of matrices of a given rank were closed under composition
[18:24:41] <somiaj> I just find various matrix properities (like rank) far more intuititve if you think of the transform
[18:24:52] <somiaj> vs thinking of the linearly independence of the rows
[18:25:10] <dila> yes i see that now
[18:25:12] <somiaj> dila: they aren't in many cases
[18:25:29] <somiaj> now if you have square matrices and the rank = number of rows, yes
[18:25:33] <riv> invertible matrices would be closed, but also would have to be full rank
[18:25:38] <somiaj> but this more boils down to composition of non-singular matrices are non-singular
[18:26:14] <somiaj> but if the matrices are not invertable, you could do some rotation of spaces such that composition would change the rank
[18:26:50] <dila> but a rotation is invertible
[18:26:57] <dila> wouldn't that preserve the rank?
[18:27:23] <dila> rank(AR)=rank(A), if R is invertible and A doesn't have full rank?

[18:41:25] <klf> But then if you look at the actual bits (colored red) they are actually check for, I find that they aren't actualiy the right positions.
[18:43:09] <klf> that they should be checking for.
[18:43:37] <dila> klf: i think you have to use the parity to "correct" the missing bits marked "?"
[18:44:57] <klf> "? _ 1 _ 0 0 1 _ 1 0 1 0. Even parity so set position 1 to a 0: 0 _ 1 _ 0 0 1 _ 1 0 1 0"
[18:45:19] <dila> iirc the hamming code has the property that the syndrome vector, when interpretted as the binary expansion of an integer, gives the index of the error position in the codeword vector
[18:46:23] <dila> but that's not true for all block codes
[18:47:35] <dila> klf: another way to answer this question is to write variables in place of the missing digits and write out the equations producing the parity bits
[18:47:48] <dila> then the parity bits are functions of those variables
[18:48:45] <klf> For example, I think *0* in "? _ 1 _ 0 0 1 _ 1 0 1 0. Even parity so set position 1 to a 0: 0 _ 1 _ *0* 0 1 _ 1 0 1 0"
[18:49:09] <klf> should not be checked
[18:49:36] <dila> the hamming code can only detect up to two errors
[18:49:38] <klf> since the first parity bit checks every other.
[18:50:15] <dila> you have more unknowns than hamming can deal with klf
[18:50:29] <klf> let me instead take a screen shot and then annotate, then I think it'll be easier
[18:50:30] <dila> so that block of bits must split into two or more codewords
[18:52:46] <klf> dila, so you are saying that the calcuations in that example is correct?

[23:24:47] <riv> so the set of open sets of a top. is a basis for that toplogy
