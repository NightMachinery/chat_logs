[07:02:25] <Sven_vB> I'm using docker 20.10.13 on Ubuntu focal. on the outside host I have an HTTP proxy on port 3128, bound to the host's 127.0.0.1. I'd like to use that proxy for downloads inside my container. obviously I cannot address it by IP 127.0.0.1 because inside the container, that will address the network inside the container. is there an easy way to share the proxy into the container?
[07:03:25] <njka> lantech19446: yes, you can... you can containerize lots of things
[07:03:35] <njka> i have a container for lots of stuff... 
[07:03:41] <njka> like the awscli tools for example
[07:04:24] <njka> i get a new machine, i download my awscli container and make sure i have my aws keys on my host and done :)
[07:04:48] <njka> containers... portable and predictable :)
[07:05:03] <programmerq> you can toss another ip on your host and have the proxy bind to that too. If it's just a virtual interface not connected to anything, it'll only be on your host and still accessible from your containers. as long as that ip doesn't conflict with any ip range in use by any of the docker or non-docker networks your host is connected to it works, but it's a hack.
[07:05:28] <programmerq> I agree with the proposal to just containerize the proxy. you can have container workloads access it and still publish to the host's 127.0.0.1:3128
[07:08:04] <lantech19446> njka: so am I understanding this correctly that i would store my playbooks somewhere on my host cd into that directory and do for instance docker run -d ansible ansible-playbook listupdates.yml ?
[07:08:30] <njka> lantech19446: no
[07:08:35] <programmerq> you'd need to actually get that file into the container somehow
[07:08:40] <lantech19446> ok
[07:09:06] <lantech19446> ok so i need to learn dockerfiles
[07:09:26] <programmerq> that is handy, yes
[07:09:32] <njka> lantech19446: you'd need an ansible container and then you'd want to like bind mount your playbook directory into that ansible container
[07:09:45] <programmerq> but I'd do a bind mount for this particular usecase.
[07:09:59] <njka> lantech19446: yes, you are asking about like step 5 and you don't quite understand step 1 yet :)
[07:10:38] <lantech19446> i have that habit with everything lol
[07:11:32] <gurki> why use containers instead of vms if all u do is to run ansible playbooks?
[07:12:05] <lantech19446> gurki: because i want the ability to use the machine for far more than that and because i'm trying to learn and want a use case

[07:14:20] <Sven_vB> programmerq, yeah, that was my idea in case there is no easier way. I guess I'll have to then.
[07:14:24] <Sven_vB> programmerq, thanks!
[07:15:38] <lantech19446> njka: so using the example of tomcat because it tells me the directory for all the config files, if I were to use a -v and map it to some directory on my server would that give me access to the files already in that directory? 
[07:15:40] <programmerq> in many ways, from a docker networking perspective, your docker host is a bit like a consumer router for a home network. Trying to access something that's only on the 127.0.0.1 of your router is kind of a pain when you're on another device.
[07:16:19] <Sven_vB> programmerq, I had hoped there was some kind of reverse docker-userland-proxy
[07:16:33] <programmerq> it just sets up nat out for egress
[07:16:46] <programmerq> just like a laptop on a home network can nat out through the router
[07:17:59] <Sven_vB> would it help to have the proxy listen on an address in the subnet of the docker0 interface?
[07:18:26] <programmerq> yes, for containers on the docker0 network, you can have stuff on the host listen on the docker0 interface and the containers can connect to that
[07:18:27] <Sven_vB> or actually on the IP that ifconfig says docker0 has
[07:18:36] <Sven_vB> oh nice
[07:18:43] <programmerq> the docker0 ip is the gateway ip for any container in the docker0 network
[07:19:09] <Sven_vB> then I'll just have inetd listen on docker0 and forward to localhost
[07:19:09] <programmerq> but if you have a user-defined network, then those containers will hairpin nat out to the docker0 interface-- I haven't tried it in a long time

[18:08:52] <Windy> is there any way to read/write an SMB filesystem without adding capabilities to the container?  eg with default capabilities
[18:12:55] *** Joins: haritz (~hrtz@user/haritz)
[18:14:19] <programmerq> Windy: you can't mount from inside a container with default capabilities, but if you push that mount operation out to docker itself and set up a volume backed by samba (or a bind mount with a previously mounted samba mount in place), then it'll work. Usually a samba share gets mounted in a way that sets the ownership uid:gid for all files in the whole share, so as long as the user of the
[18:14:22] <programmerq> containerized process has a numeric uid:gid that fits within the permissions for the files it is accessing, it works just fine.

[19:09:50] <programmerq> there's not a good way to do that because the point of the userns-remap is kind of to further isolate the containerized processes even further from the host-- including what effective uid is used.
[19:10:53] <programmerq> you could run one container with the userns disabled and have that mount the docker socket. It could then act as a proxy for your other container that accesses docker over a container-to-container network connection. Something like socat can listen on tcp and connect to a unix socket.

[20:40:20] <tabakhase> Sven_vB hoting a regitry is just a docker run - auth is more the deal... (if you use gitlab/gcloud or there like you also get a registry with auth there) - but yes you can also docker save/load to "make tarballs"

[20:47:02] <Sven_vB> I'm looking for the easiest way to make my image available for docker run, so load and a pipe won't work for that.
[20:48:36] <tabakhase> guess for super-madness one could "build the image", with a `echo -e "FROM scratch\nADD http://some.tar /" | docker build -t output -` or such, but that feels suuuuuuper ugly, and has little benefit, many drawbacks :D
[20:49:02] <tabakhase> but that way one could encasulate it in a dockerfile to say, build it with compose *shivers*
[20:49:50] <tabakhase> ((and "auth" would still be just as much of an issue there i guess))
[20:50:03] <Sven_vB> indeed, anything that docker-compose can use would also work for me
[20:50:15] <tabakhase> Q is more "why not a registry..."
[20:51:24] <Sven_vB> because I have a NAS with a static file webserver already, so I wouldn't need to think about where to docker run my registry and how to configure it. :D
[20:51:59] <tabakhase> dockerhub, github, gitlab, gpc, aws, heck even some hosters offer "standalone registries" these days if you dont want to run one yourself...
[20:52:46] <Sven_vB> yes but they're all in the cloud. I want something that works in my local network, too.
[20:53:03] <tabakhase> if its LAN - and auth is not a concern - just runnign a registry-container anywhere will likely do just fine - synology and there like do run dockers these days dont they.. -- and i geuss if you have use for docker images, you will have a docker-daemon _somewhere_ :P

[23:25:29] <dob1> if I change TZ on docker-compose this doesn't affect a just created container, or am I wrong?
[23:26:09] <dob1> ah no
[23:26:31] <dob1> it seems TZ gets ignored
[23:27:42] <cim> dob1: if you use a .env file and all the containers uses that file then it would affect all of them
[23:28:58] <dob1> cim, right, thanks

[23:43:23] <pidroid> why some healthcheck is defined like this : test: ["CMD-SHELL", "curl -f http://localhost || exit 1"]
[23:43:54] <pidroid> why not  : test: ["CMD-SHELL", "curl -f http://localhost"]
[23:44:25] <programmerq> what is that from? a compose file? a Dockerfile?
[23:44:46] <pidroid> sorry it's from a docker-compose.yml

[23:45:26] <pidroid> i redo it for some dockerfile without healthcheck included but i like to know what i do something
[23:45:43] <programmerq> https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#healthcheck - this explains it in the compose v3 syntax ref
[23:46:10] <programmerq> it looks like CMD-SHELL will wrap the next argument inside a shell wrapper similar to how a RUN directive would do the wrap.
[23:47:34] *** Joins: Haxxa (~Haxxa@202-130-210-100.ip4.superloop.com)
[23:48:20] <programmerq> it seems like maybe the HEALTHCHECK directive might support CMD-SHELL too in a Dockerfile, but it isn't in the docs. strange.
[23:48:27] <pidroid> there is the same below : test: curl -f https://localhost || exit 1
[23:48:42] <pidroid> oh
[23:48:53] <pidroid> something i didn't understand
[23:50:13] <pidroid> oups i'm sorry
[23:50:28] <pidroid> curl can return other things than 1 when it failed
[23:51:11] * pidroid check his watch "maybe it's time to sleep..." XD
[23:51:33] <ikke> is only an exit code of 1 considered a failed check?
[23:55:24] <pidroid> i don't know but maybe
[23:55:29] <pidroid> i test it yet
