I feel like I'm having a hard time deciding how to chop up/separate/organize for "larger" projects. In general how should I be planning out a project before I start writing

[01:44:32] <Kerr> IE Right now I'm thinking I want to write an N-body gravity simulation with point particles (just 2d). I'd like to use SDL2 and render the simulation to a window, which will be mainly white dots of various sizes, so not too crazy. Now I'm presented with a ton of questions like: Where do I keep settings (like window resolution)? Do I just do the SDL
[01:44:33] <Kerr> initialization stuff in main() or should I separate it into an init function, or more broadly separate it out into a whole separate file like renderer.cpp and create an object to encapsulate all the rendering work? If I save a configuration file, should I load it in main then use the information to initialize other parts of the program, or should I
[01:44:33] <Kerr> make a separate configLoader object that other objects talk to to get settings? Since the simulation is the main point of the program, do I do the simulation loop in main, or do I make a separate simulation file... etc etc
[01:45:24] <Kerr> what should be the approach to making decisions like these? Reading suggestions welcome also.

[03:30:56] <Eelis> the key requirements that you worried made some fine-looking code UB were removed by modifications explicitly intended to correct requirements for inline variables. mystery solved i'd say
[03:32:57] <PJBoy> so now they need not have the same definition, but the definitions must use all the same tokens still
[03:33:14] <PJBoy> which does seem to make it fine
[03:33:43] <Eelis> i think the "same definition" line always meant to imply the thing about tokens. after all it referred immediately to that section for details

[04:35:32] <Kerr> Since I'm used to embedded stuff (as an EE student), It is basically like "Use all of the c++ language features you'll never use on any embedded application ever".

[13:54:11] <RandomReader> a non-capturing lambda can be converted to a function pointer, so if you're working with an API that accepts a function pointer for a callback, that would explain it
[13:54:21] <RandomReader> and the answer in that case is: you can't capture

[20:52:57] <AliceMeows> Prior to c++17 doing this with enable_if was considered to be abuse of sfinae to overload based entirely on return type which isn't  technically possible in the language
[20:52:59] <GyrosGeier> that's totally fine
[20:53:18] <imMute> that's what stuff like boost::lexical_cast does all the time
[20:53:34] <imMute> (the templating so you can "overload" based on return type)
[20:54:07] <GyrosGeier> also, overloading on return type is somewhat possible by creating a proxy object that has conversion operators
