[00:26:55] <Lartza> Building a service, one error at a time? :,D
[00:27:04] <LordKalma> of course :D hahaha
[00:27:14] <LordKalma> django rest framework, react.js frontend
[00:27:26] <LordKalma> I already knew Python from the numpy world, which I do a whole lot
[00:27:37] <Lartza> That's what I had fun with last spring

[00:27:40] <LordKalma> first time doing any webdev, django, javascript, react, html, css, etc
[00:27:43] <Lartza> Now looking into fastapi + react instead
[00:28:28] <LordKalma> didn't know about fast api
[00:28:38] <LordKalma> I like the ORM of django
[00:28:41] <LordKalma> and hjey, what works works
[00:30:13] <Lartza> Yeah it has definitely been a journey writing lot's of things Django's ORM handles :D
[00:30:38] <Lartza> I am still using an ORM though, just sqlalchemy
[00:31:08] <Lartza> And then messing with pedantic and writing that into fastapi endpoints and ugh, but trying new things is good too :D
[00:31:33] <LordKalma> for sure
[00:32:00] <LordKalma> I do numpy/scipy stuff at my daytime job as a physicist/engineer
[00:32:21] <LordKalma> currently with this website pet project and a c++ software-defined radio project
[00:32:34] <Lartza> Still a student myself, and preferably less of a programming career :D So just hobby projects for me too
[00:32:57] <Lartza> Well drf + react last spring was actually a school project with a team
[00:33:03] <LordKalma> I'm a student as a well
[00:33:06] <LordKalma> just a PhD student :)
[00:33:21] <Lartza> Haha yeah I'm... bachelor's but shouldn't be anymore
[00:33:37] <LordKalma> don't worry abouyt that. Things take time
[00:33:43] <LordKalma> I took an extra year to complete my masters
[00:33:45] <LordKalma> means nothing
[00:33:54] <Lartza> Yeah I've been to therapy for two years now and future is looking brighter :P
[00:34:15] <LordKalma> cool
[00:34:26] <LordKalma> it's great that people look for help with their mental health

[00:35:18] <Lartza> Yeah definitely should have done it sooner but it is what it is
[00:35:42] <Lartza> Are you receiving or transmitting radio? I don't know what repeaters are in amateur radio context
[00:36:16] <LordKalma> amateur radio aren't pirate broadcasting stations :)
[00:36:30] <LordKalma> repeaters are things you transmit to and retransmit it at a higher power
[00:36:50] <Lartza> Arrr. I also don't really like axios, just seems unneccessary to me
[00:37:14] <Lartza> Everything JS already seems so bloatead, maybe it was masochism using fetch() though xD
[00:37:28] <LordKalma> idk, i just followed a suggestion I saw elsewhere
[00:37:33] <LordKalma> discovering this stuff myself
[00:37:43] <Lartza> Yeah I mean axios is the go-to API client but
[00:38:15] <Lartza> fetch('http://example.com/movies.json').then(response => response.json()), no library needed
[00:38:57] <LordKalma> hahaha using react already pulls in 1245324345 dependencies
[00:38:59] <LordKalma> who cares anymore haha

[00:39:12] <LordKalma> the deprecation warnings on this stuff are amazing
[00:39:15] <LordKalma> it's a buttload of them
[00:39:24] <Lartza> I was kind of the architech in my student project, someone would have probably pulled in axios if I didn't say no
[00:41:15] <Lartza> I can also do you one better than deprecation
[00:41:18] <Lartza> 58 vulnerabilities (16 moderate, 40 high, 2 critical)
[00:41:26] <LordKalma> I already have react-bootstrap, react-helmet-async, react-router, react-router-hash-link, axios
[00:41:28] <LordKalma> and their dependencies
[00:41:50] <LordKalma> that's exactly how many I have, I think
[00:42:26] <Lartza> It's from react-scripts, not actually an issue :P
[00:42:31] <LordKalma> anyway
[00:42:40] <LordKalma> i've always been a fan of not reinventing the wheel
[00:42:41] <Lartza> Yeah we didn't use react router either, so only pulleld in react, react-dom and react-modal really
[00:42:52] <Lartza> When did I say anything about doing that ;P
[00:42:53] <LordKalma> "just wordpress it" was usually my answer to everything
[00:43:04] <LordKalma> but yeah, I have a very specific data model
[00:43:12] <LordKalma> and so here I am, writing stuff from scratch
[00:43:39] <Lartza> Well, with Django not entirely from scratch ;)
[00:44:01] <LordKalma> i mean writing a frontend
[00:44:13] <Lartza> Well yeah frontends are always...
[00:44:15] <LordKalma> but yeah, Django does SO MUCH of the heavy lifting
[00:44:20] <Lartza> You can't really just throw your data to something general
[00:44:28] <Lartza> Other than forms maybe it just won't work
[00:44:32] <Lartza> And pure tables
[00:44:38] <LordKalma> yeah, true
[00:44:51] <LordKalma> I think maybe it would be possible with like plone, but plone/zope's API is crazy
[00:44:59] <LordKalma> also, is it also an insta ban talking about plone? hahah
[00:45:17] <Lartza> I don't even know what that is
[00:45:28] <LordKalma> but yeah, I'm a terrible UI designer, but now I'll have to do something
[00:45:42] <LordKalma> plone is the framework for every corporate intranet ever haha
[00:45:42] <Lartza> Bootstrap best UI design ;)
[00:45:50] <LordKalma> already using that :p
[00:46:02] * Lartza checks school intra
[00:46:08] <LordKalma> haha probably custyom
[00:46:20] <LordKalma> but a lot of enterprise uses plone for their intranets
[00:46:25] <LordKalma> it's easy to create administraative flows
[00:46:36] <LordKalma> like you fill in a form and the approval process starts
[00:46:42] <LordKalma> with the right persons notified in the right order
[00:46:44] <LordKalma> that sorts stuff
[00:47:01] <LordKalma> very file-oriented too, the only CMS with build-in "file explorer"-kinda thing
[00:47:05] <LordKalma> prtty cool actually
[00:47:11] <LordKalma> but too complicated imho
[00:47:17] <LordKalma> (and a hell to deploy)
[00:49:39] <Lartza> I can't at least spy any software name from the intra heh
[00:51:16] <FunkyBob> sounds very ITIL, Lartza
[00:51:54] <Lartza> Not sure what you mean by that
[00:52:06] <FunkyBob> I meant LordKalma
[00:52:23] <LordKalma> don't know what that is
[00:52:30] <LordKalma> anyway, you can see it https://plone.org/
[00:52:50] <FunkyBob> I remember the early days of plone... I was a ZOPE user way back
[00:53:11] <FunkyBob> ITIL describes a lot of things, but one is a workflow systems  methodoloty
[00:53:15] <FunkyBob> methodology, even
[00:53:36] <LordKalma> http://plone-demo.quintagroup.com/ this demo that uses the old Plone 3 might bring back some memories
[00:53:46] <LordKalma> I worked in places with plone 3 intranets
[00:53:52] <FunkyBob> never really got into plone
[00:54:21] <LordKalma> i only worked with it, never on it

[02:27:54] <dre> VFSIO, you can make a @property to generate it, but that's in the class, not on the database
[02:28:32] <VFSIO> dre, I've made an attempt overriding the __init__ method
[02:28:42] <VFSIO> Would you mind taking a look on this approach? https://dpaste.org/ayes

[02:32:56] <VFSIO> 1)I want to change the filename before saving (my model has a UUID field, I want to use this as the filename)
[02:32:56] <VFSIO> I think I solved that part using a function as input for upload_to
[02:32:57] <VFSIO> 2)I also want to include a CustomDisposition header, so amazon serves this file as an attachment, and use a friendlier name.
[02:32:57] <VFSIO> This one is trickier. My attempt (which seems to work) was to override my storage class __init__ method, so it can receive a new named argument "metadata_filename".
[02:32:58] <VFSIO> I change the filefield.storage class with a pre_save hook.
[02:32:58] <VFSIO> It seems to work as expected (files are being saved to S3 with the uuid as the filename, and when I download it, they are named as the timestamp generated on my pre_save handler function), but I`m worried I might be doing something "dangerous" with unintended consequences.

[06:22:45] <FunkyBob> prove it
