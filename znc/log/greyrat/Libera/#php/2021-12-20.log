[11:51:53] <AllenJB> The \DateTime::ISO8601 constant is a misnomer. It's one specific format of many ISO8601-compliant formats. I generally avoid that constant.
[11:51:55] <AllenJB> Except MySQL, most sources I deal with that use a standard format use RFC3339 or RFC3339 Extended (w/ subseconds). RFC3339 is a much more specific format than ISO8601.
[11:52:59] <AllenJB> Also you probably want "!Y-m-d" to ensure unspecified components are "zeroed" (eg. 00:00:00 instead of using the current time)

[14:13:33] <chazy> hi, i'm not 100% sure if this question has more to do with php or js, i have a front-end script that sends an ajax request to my php server, but sometimes it just fails, even though i recursively retry (like 10 times max) the ajax request so that it reaches the server and gets a response, is this a backend or frontend problem? how should i fix this?
[14:14:01] <chazy> but now that i asked it, looks like it's more frontend related...
[14:16:51] <AllenJB> Why does the AJAX request fail? What's the response from the server when it fails? Are there any errors in PHP error log or application logs when the AJAX request fails?
[14:19:57] *** Quits: BadAdviceCat (~BadAdvice@user/badadvicecat) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[14:23:35] <TinoDidriksen> Indeed, why does it fail at all? It shouldn't.
[14:23:46] <chazy> AllenJB: I have no idea, i tried to reproduce this many times but it's no use, I think the problem is some users are just (physically) too far away from the server and they have too many failed connections (like the server is in central europe and they're from shouth america), or maybe it has nothing to do with that
[14:24:24] <AllenJB> You might want to look into some client-side error reporting such as Sentry
[14:25:45] <TinoDidriksen> You can simulate packet loss and other connection latency issues, but you should first verify this is a problem which you can do by having them "ping" your server and see if packets are lost.
[14:25:46] <chazy> the front-end gets a response from a third-party server and then it has to send that data to the website's server, that's why i know, i can see stuff went on, on this other server but nothing on the database
[14:26:47] <TinoDidriksen> Distance in itself isn't an issue. Even around the globe is max 300ms latency, which is workable.

[14:36:43] <silv3r_m00n> hi there
[14:36:44] <TinoDidriksen> Indeed. Find the actual issue first.
[14:37:25] <silv3r_m00n> there is a parent class and lots of child classes that over-ride some methods of the parent class, now if the parent class changes the names of one such method, is it possible for the child class to throw an error ?
[14:37:57] <silv3r_m00n> basically a sub-class needs to ensure that a class is present in parent class
[14:38:09] <Naktibalda> silv3r_m00n: it would fail if it called parent::sameName();
[14:38:36] <silv3r_m00n> then we need to make the all child functions call thir parent version mandatorily
[14:38:38] <AllenJB> If the child class never calls the parent class method, an error won't be thrown.
[14:38:44] <Naktibalda> and if you don't call parent, then why do you care?
[14:39:27] <AllenJB> You might want to look at abstract methods and interfaces.
[14:40:04] <AllenJB> You also might want to look at IDE refactoring tools which can help ensure child class methods are renamed.
[14:41:51] <silv3r_m00n> AllenJB: ahh, yes refactoring, that was the concern here
[14:42:08] <silv3r_m00n> i ocassionally rename important functions in parent class, then worrying about the sub classes since they would never know
[14:42:40] <Naktibalda> you should avoid doint that and it is your responsibility to update all child classes if you changed parent

[19:00:37] <stenno> oh its rest, not spread, right
[19:01:18] <Naktibalda> relipse: you could change the type of $items to array
[19:03:37] <relipse> that's kind of a sad way to "fix" it

[19:04:30] <relipse> k thanks
[19:07:42] <stenno> hmm but i wasn't wrong, $param itself will be an array
[19:08:10] <Naktibalda> it will be array, but you can't pass array to it

[20:57:20] <chazy> i've got a question of "should i do x with php or sql"? i'm not sure, i have this training(character_id, done) table, and then training_session(training_id, start, end), each training has a maximum duration of 6 hours, but the user can start/stop (sessions) at will, should i just calculate the times with php or add some extra column to training_session?
[21:01:08] <Albright> chazy: If I'm understanding what you want to do correctly, you could add a column to training_session named something like paused_by_user which can be a 0 or 1. Right?
[21:01:41] <Albright> Maybe I don't understand the time calculation part.
[21:01:42] <chazy> like user bob starts training his character and after 2 hours he stops the training, the next time he starts training his character, how do i handle training_session? a foreach, calculate the # of hours for each session and create a new session (if less than max hours) or set the training to done (if equal or greater than max hours), and that's it?
[21:02:20] <chazy> should i do it like that or is there a better way? like paused_by_user column?
[21:03:41] <Albright> So if the training takes six hours to complete, you could have started_at, elapsed, is_paused
[21:04:17] <Albright> Wait, no, that won't work
[21:05:20] <Albright> started_at, paused_duration, is_paused
[21:05:23] <chazy> the thing about max (6) hours is we reward users for each hour of training, but each training (type) has a max duration of 6 hours (overflow hours are lost)
[21:05:31] <Albright> When pausing, set is_paused to 0
[21:05:36] <chazy> but that's irrelevant i think
[21:05:47] <Albright> When unpausing, set is_paused to 1, the amount of time that passed while paused to paused_duration
[21:06:01] <Albright> Er, reverse the 0 and 1
[21:06:20] <chazy> hmm what about starting/stoping more than 2 times? where do i store that?
[21:06:30] <Albright> if (current_timestamp() - paused_duration - started_at) > 6 hours…
[21:06:44] <Albright> You'd just add more time to paused_duration
[21:07:08] <Albright> I guess you could replace is_paused with paused_at which is a timestamp storing when pausing started, or NULL if not paused
[21:07:29] <__adrian> training should be contiguous. if multiple training periods apply to the same "session," that's a separate thing.
[21:07:35] <da_wunder> or store those to another table, just to get support for multiple pauses
[21:07:38] <__adrian> start, end, no restarting.
[21:08:00] <__adrian> aggregate when you select
[21:08:34] <Albright> Yeah, come to think of it, just storing each training period as a separate session and adding together the total times might be simpler
[21:08:41] <Albright> *would definitely be simpler
[21:08:44] <chazy> hmm session and period are interchangable, what i mean with training_session is to represent when the user starts/stop the training until the # of hours is 6 or more
[21:09:32] <__adrian> if you want to allow users to start and stop and restart, then they're not interchangable.
[21:09:54] <__adrian> they're different concepts.
[21:10:08] <chazy> so, it's simpler with a one to many relationship? (one training many training_session)?
[21:10:11] <chazy> hmm
[21:10:15] <Albright> Precisely.
[21:10:27] <__adrian> you have some period(s) of time that will apply to completing a particular goal (session)
[21:10:28] <chazy> __adrian: you mean resume instead of restart?
[21:10:38] <__adrian> sure
[21:11:10] <__adrian> e.g., you might have  training_session(id, name, etc)  training(start, stop, session)
[21:11:28] <chazy> a session can be any amount of time, 1 second or 1k hours
[21:12:19] <chazy> training_session as parent table?
[21:12:26] <__adrian> maybe you want to rename. what you're calling a "session" i'd associate with the _goal_ (purpose), not the specific period(s) the user is working towards them.
[21:12:43] <__adrian> give me an example of a "training session"
[21:13:52] <chazy> like i start training my character but when it's time to play with it i stop it's training session to play, after that i just resume it (if less than max hours) or start a new training
[21:14:24] <__adrian> what's an example of a "training session"? like, give me a name. training for what?
[21:14:50] <chazy> to get improve stats and get rewards (for every hour)
[21:15:17] <__adrian> i'll make an example. let's say, "weights training."

[21:16:05] <chazy> that'd be training type
[21:16:12] <__adrian> so you might have  training_session(id:44, name:weights, hours:6)
[21:16:20] <chazy> each type has a max duration
[21:17:09] <__adrian> then a user would start the session. you'd do  user_training(user:9, session:44, start:2021-12-20T12:47:13)
[21:17:17] <chazy> we want users to switch to a different type once the max duration is reached
[21:17:22] <__adrian> this is fine
[21:17:28] <__adrian> are you following my example?
[21:17:30] <chazy> yes
[21:17:43] <__adrian> when they stop training, you'd end that user_training
[21:17:59] <__adrian> if they started again (and still had more time), it would be a NEW user_training record.

[23:27:41] <ham5> then chdir to $olddir when done.. how bad is that?
[23:27:59] <__adrian> why not use __DIR__ in your path instead?
[23:28:13] <__adrian> yes, you could do that, but it's rather contrived

[23:47:47] <relipse> who has used PHP attributes ?
[23:48:02] <relipse> like in serious code

[23:52:21] <relipse> another question, https://3v4l.org/ says the live preview basically runs php 7.4 in the browser. how is that possible?
[23:52:33] <__adrian> it doesn't run in the browser
[23:52:54] <zenox2> so, symfony 6, easyadmin 4.0.1, i can't get collectionfields to actually implement any constraints. it this supposed to happen?
[23:54:25] <da_wunder> zenox2: I recommend you to ask that on Symfony Slack workspace there is dedicated #easyadminbundle channel there, where you can find actual maintainers of repository
[23:54:34] <relipse> __adrian: it says here that it does: https://i.imgur.com/LClFtwX.png
[23:55:04] <zenox2> wunder, thanks, i have. the symfony slack is generally quiet, the easyadmin one even more so
[23:55:14] <relipse> what is easyadmin?
[23:55:30] <zenox2> a form generator for the symfony framework
[23:55:48] <da_wunder> quiet? I don't see that
[23:55:50] <__adrian> trying it out, it doesn't seem to work, but i see fetch requests. i would assume it was meant to just run on the server and then show the results - but if they say different, then you'd have to ask them
[23:55:53] <zenox2> you define generally one class and it handles all the crud and templating
[23:56:05] <da_wunder> all the channelds where I'm on there are active ones
[23:56:06] <__adrian> if it is being parsed / "run" in js, i would not expect it to be very reliable
[23:56:46] <zenox2> wunder, sure they're active, just not like irc active
[23:57:20] <zenox2> when you have code infront of you and you're wtf'ing it'd be nice to know that it isn't you
[23:57:25] <da_wunder> this irc channel is like 99% less active than symfony slack
[23:57:36] <judah> lot friendlier though
[23:57:41] <AllenJB> relipse: It uses web assembly to run PHP, in an emulated x86 environment by the looks - the XHR stack traces I see in chrome reference "x86emu-wasm.wasm"
[23:57:52] <da_wunder> and that is what I have seen like last ~5 years
[23:58:13] <zenox2> well in the last 3 mins, more lines have been written than in general and general combined
[23:58:22] <zenox2> general and support i mean
[23:58:56] <zenox2> judah yeah, everything is overregulated
[23:58:58] <da_wunder> no activity on those channels at all...
[23:59:21] <da_wunder> zenox2: and also note that this is ##php and not #symfony
[23:59:45] <judah> I know this chat has a bit of a reputation for being cold, but a lot of the framework-specific communities are just outright toxic
[23:59:48] <zenox2> sure, but symfony is fairly synonymous with php nowadays
[23:59:56] <relipse> no it's not
[23:59:57] <judah> *cough cough* laravel *cough*
