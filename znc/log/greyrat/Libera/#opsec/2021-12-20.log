[01:47:51] <Joanna> iz: jan6 it’s difficult for most people to unlearn what they have been taught. Deliberately teaching garbage shouldn’t be tolerated to begin with. The bad things that people do are a direct result of what they were taught so teaching misinformation has serious consequences.
[01:53:04] <iz> it's not misinformation, it's incorrect expectations -- the expectation that what happens in tv shows is the same as what happens in real life
[02:04:15] <jan6> ^exactly
[02:04:41] <jan6> most of the garbage isn't deliberate
[02:05:11] <jan6> and most of what is "taught" is promptly forgotten, because it was never truly learned
[02:06:01] <jan6> tv shows and movies and such, are entertainment, fantasy worlds to tell a story you'd like to watch, and most people understand that they're just stories
[02:08:50] <jan6> of course, watching a lot of stuff with X themes, would also normalize it, but then again, you're free to choose what you read/watch/consume, in the first place
[02:10:47] <jan6> and mainstream media is generally always pretty close to what the mainstream's opinions are, if lgbtq people start making considerable numbers, then people are gonna add some of them to the movies, if racism gets to be in news, you can bet the next movie will have sliiiightly more diversity, etc etc, same with any topic
[02:10:57] <jan6> life is change
[02:12:37] <jan6> also most of the bad things, at least afaik, aren't results of any specific teachings, but rather people's own views and decisions and conditions, it's often because of UNDEReducation, also

[03:25:46] <Joanna> There are hundreds of millions of people who are controlled by what they saw on tv unfortunately.
[03:26:50] <jan6> nobody is controlled by that
[03:26:59] <jan6> but it is the voice of authority
[03:27:13] <Joanna> jan6: there is no such thing as education teaching all options. And if you happen upon the option of walking away from it they will get very angry
[03:27:17] <jan6> the same way you could say hundreds of billions are controlled by a couple of guys in government
[03:27:26] <jan6> not ALL, obviously
[03:27:32] <Joanna> I quit high school so I know this
[03:28:43] <jan6> but education's purpose isn't to teach THINGS, it's to teach how to work with things, and how to understand things, for which it also requires some things themselves to be learnt
[03:29:27] <jan6> idk how your system corresponds with over here, but we have basically classes/grades/years 1-12, and I can also say that the last 3 are pretty worthless themselves
[03:29:36] <Joanna> Judging by the current situation I’d say formal education has done more harm than good.
[03:29:44] <jan6> no
[03:29:53] <jan6> you can't judge a situation by a single factor
[03:30:11] <jan6> most of the harm nowdays comes not from education, but from social media
[03:30:35] <jan6> which encourage feedback loops and cult-like groups to form
[03:31:32] <Joanna> I don’t know what your education is like but where I’m from it consists of sitting in uncomfortable chairs in a room with unpleasant people for thousands of hours memorizing and forgetting useless stuff
[03:32:17] <jan6> it's not really useless, well, a considerable portion isn't, at least
[03:33:36] <Joanna> It’s beyond useless a large portion of it is harmful.
[03:34:06] <Joanna> Which is why the majority of people can’t think properly
[03:34:10] <jan6> for example math might be taught poorly, but it could be quite useful in a lot of ways, chemistry can help you understand what sort of cleaner would work better for your mess, geography you'd need to have a clue about where stuff is, (although granted, you probably don't need to memorize it past the general country locations), etc
[03:34:12] <Joanna> Or at Ll
[03:34:15] <Joanna> All
[03:34:24] <jan6> please describe what parts are harmful, how
[03:34:30] <jan6> teaching METHOD, I agree, is bad
[03:34:35] <jan6> but how are the CONTENTS, bad
[03:35:08] <Joanna> Being forced to sit next to toxic people
[03:35:14] <jan6> that's not taught
[03:35:23] <Joanna> Who sometimes punch me in the face
[03:35:26] <jan6> that's the "how" not the "what"
[03:35:48] <Joanna> That’s what school is for
[03:35:59] <Joanna> To teach
[03:36:12] <jan6> and punching is supposed to not be allowed (although depending on the place, teachers might not care, or might be too busy to notice)
[03:36:51] <Joanna> It is against the law to not go there to be punched in the face...
[03:37:08] <jan6> please show that piece of law where it says that
[03:37:24] <jan6> because we discussed it earlier
[03:37:39] <Joanna> Mandatory school attendance is a law
[03:37:56] <jan6> it's not like you have to go to a school physically, you can get homeschooling set up
[03:38:08] <jan6> we discussed it some time back
[03:38:27] <jan6> you just have to get certified as knowing certain subjects to a certain level
[03:38:33] <jan6> you don't have to do that at a school
[03:38:40] <jan6> school is just the "default"
[03:39:50] <jan6> most adults tend to be working a significant portion of the day, and as such don't have the time and energy to homeschool, which is why school is the default
[03:41:12] <jan6> for example some info can be gotten from https://hslda.org/legal/ for usa

[03:44:28] <Joanna> The only thing that matters is if your parents smart care about your well being or not.
[03:44:48] <jan6> plus if they have the time and energy and intelligence
[03:45:09] <Joanna> School is for people who hate their kids to get rid of them during the day.
[03:45:43] <Joanna> Even people with PhD can be stupid
[03:45:52] <jan6> of course
[03:46:30] <jan6> from what I've heard, university people, and universities themselves, are often more ridiculous than the previous stages
[03:47:05] <jan6> but that also proves that you don't have to actually learn anything, doesn't it <P
[04:08:06] <Joanna> They just memorize and take tests is all
[04:09:16] <Joanna> With regards to story telling.. most stuff in media always has similar plots.
[04:11:12] <Joanna> It amazes me that nothing seems to deter most people from sending their kids to school, not even all the shootings..
