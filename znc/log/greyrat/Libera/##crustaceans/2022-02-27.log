[01:45:07] <imode> I see what you peruse lmfao.
[01:45:18] <gerikson> it's an ok blog
[01:45:25] <gerikson> the shitty comments are not
[01:46:04] <imode> considering a title like that.
[01:47:33] <gwozniak> Is there any reason to pay attention to Assange at this point?
[01:47:55] <gerikson> lolno
[01:47:57] <gwozniak> Also, wondering what Snowden is saying these days.  Isn't he still in Russia?
[01:48:06] <gerikson> was gonna say
[01:48:50] <gwozniak> Not seeing a lot quotes from him from the "freedom" people in my Twitter feed
[01:49:22] <gwozniak> Not that I think Snowden is some nutjob, but he does get quoted by them a bit
[01:51:41] <gwozniak> Well, I cleaned the drain area in my dishwasher and I guess I didn't put it back together quite right.  The spinner on the bottom dislodged and melted on the heating element
[01:51:49] <imode> damn.
[01:52:35] <gwozniak> I popped it all in place and spun it around and didn't see anything loose, so I thought it was okay.  It was not.
[01:52:36] <gerikson> I think Snowden is in a tough position, and I also think a FSB major has him on his task list to ensure he only hears th Russian side of things
[01:53:05] <gerikson> gwozniak: I hate those parts
[01:53:40] <gwozniak> As luck would have it, I don't hate doing dishes, so I guess I have that duty for a couple of days
[01:54:32] <gwozniak> I did the progressive urban thing today and walked to the pet store to get what I needed, even though it's a slightly hostile walk
[01:54:55] <gwozniak> Took an hour but it was worth it to get out for a while
[01:56:01] <imode> slightly hostile?
[01:56:22] <gwozniak> It's a long way and you have to walk through parking lots
[01:56:33] <gwozniak> It's totally meant for cars
[01:57:29] <gwozniak> There's another pet supply store that it closer, but barely has sidewalks to it
[01:57:48] <gwozniak> And you have to walk along a very busy street that is incredibly loud

[02:22:54] <imode> ukraine has an air raid coming at it.
[02:43:09] <wrl> allegedly
[02:43:22] <wrl> ukraine has already shot several paratrooper planes out of the sky so far
[02:43:32] <imode> get some, get some.
[02:43:43] <wrl> bro the klitschko brothers are defending kyiv
[02:50:58] <kline> wrl, i have a friend in the paras who was like "damn see airborne are still relevant as fuck" but he didnt know the reason why these two planeloads were in the news
[02:51:15] <kline> (uk paras havent dropped in like 50 years and they are mad salty about it)

[03:35:26] <kline> apple devs btfo
[03:54:28] <drakonis> lol what
[03:54:41] <drakonis> is apple killing swift?
[04:06:30] <gwozniak> kline: I wasn't sure it was going to happen
[04:07:16] <gwozniak> I see clips and reports of Russian equipment being abandoned because they are out of fuel, and I wonder if that is accurate
[04:07:31] <gwozniak> If it is, well, that's a helluva logistical bungle
[04:31:29] <kline> drakonis, swift the payments network, russia is getting its access restricted
[04:31:55] <kline> gwozniak, check for unit/invasion markings
[04:32:17] <kline> Z, O, and U markings can be found on russian vehicles, usually in boxed white paint
[04:33:14] <kline> but yeah, a small amount of russian armour outran its fuel lines, most of the images are abandoned ukrainian transport though
[04:38:40] <imode> are things looking okay-ish for ukraine?
[04:39:09] <gwozniak> I don't know, but the stuff I've read suggests if this drags on (and it probably will), Russia will not do well
[04:39:41] <imode> good.
[04:39:48] <Brekkjern> Logistical fuckups are bound to happen, but the level of incompetency displayed by Russia is seriously fucked up.
[04:40:02] <imode> let's test the confidence of a dictator.
[04:40:41] <Brekkjern> I think the question is when they are going to deploy the big weapons. They obviously don't have the logistics and technology to play modern warfare like NATO has been doing in the middle east.
[04:41:03] <imode> define big weapons.
[04:41:28] <Brekkjern> The Soviet Union wasn't big on precision, so they compensated by making bigger bombs
[04:41:35] <imode> missiles, eh.
[04:41:51] <Brekkjern> Maybe, or big, retarded bombs.
[04:42:01] <Brekkjern> Thermobarics are a possibility there
[04:42:02] <imode> I imagine they'll do it once their columns fail repeatedly, or after their air strikes fail.
[04:42:07] <Brekkjern> They seem to have a fetish for them
[04:42:32] <kline> imode, ukraine will lose in the short term but russia has massive misunderestimated this and are bleeding cash, allies, and souls on a war they cannot now stop
[04:43:01] <imode> I'm hoping they'll at least survive.
[04:43:05] <kline> when they win, it will be despite, not because of, russian military planning
[04:43:23] <imode> so your projection is that ukraine will fall.
[04:43:39] <kline> i dont think anyone else has any other outcome in mind
[04:43:49] <Brekkjern> Depends on what "fail" and "win" means
[04:44:00] <imode> they capture the capital and ukraine surrenders.
[04:44:09] <imode> they can always wage a war of attrition.
[04:44:12] <Brekkjern> Don't have to surrender just because the capital falls.
[04:44:27] <imode> replace 'and' with an 'or'.
[04:44:44] <imode> like, I don't think they'll surrender easily.
[04:44:59] <imode> I can see them winning if they play it correctly.
[04:45:11] <kline> Brekkjern, the problem here is that russia has a bit of moveable feast. they can still say "yeah bro we only wanted the east and just needed to headshot kiev to make that happen" and give up once they have solidified their control there
[04:45:33] <Brekkjern> As long as Russia can maintain momentum of some sort and prevent this turning into a static war, then Russia will win. The moment they stop, then it will turn into a static war and it's guerillia warfare on the eastern side of the border.
[04:45:38] <kline> imode, ukraine cant win the conventional war but they can absolutely make it unsustainable to maintain an occupation, if they have the will to
[04:45:49] <imode> kline: yeah that's mostly what I'm thinking too.
[04:46:09] <Brekkjern> Err.. Replace "border" with "front"
[04:46:14] <kline> imode, but i mean, thats not winning a war, thats just putting in thousands of paper cuts until your occupier decides to give up
[04:46:30] <imode> would you say that the united states won the vietnam war then.
[04:46:32] <gwozniak> That's basically what I've read, too
[04:46:34] <kline> i maintain that western forces "won" in the middle east
[04:47:01] <gwozniak> Russia may win the battle but they won't win the war, so to speak
[04:47:07] <kline> western democracy did not manage to bring about stable regime change, but thats a geopolitical/nation building objective, not a military one
[04:47:46] <imode> sure, we dominated.
[04:47:50] <kline> the fact that it taken only a month for afghan to regress to total taliban control demonstrates how effective the military campaign was and how much depended on them day to day
[04:48:10] <kline> and just how badly the political and economic strands failed to build a future
[04:48:14] <imode> it's almost like we're one of the world's super-powers.
[04:48:18] <gwozniak> It will be non-stop funneling of equipment to any resistance that forms in Ukraine, and it will have a lot more resources behind it
[04:48:48] <imode> gwozniak: the hope is that the existing government officials stay alive and the military stays in-tact-ish.
[04:48:54] <imode> the worst thing you can have is fragmentation.
[04:49:00] <imode> which is probably what they'll go for.
[04:49:18] <imode> we're already seeing reports of captured russian forces dressed up as ukraine forces.

[04:57:56] <kline> you know about dead hand, right?
[05:01:19] <Brekkjern> Crossing the border with Russia will turn this war into something else entirely.
[05:01:35] <Brekkjern> I don't think anyone wants to see the results of that

[05:02:19] <imode> no system is without flaw.

[05:59:52] <Church> Ahhh this is true
[06:00:03] <Church> I wonder how many more people are going to jump ship...
[06:00:10] <Church> We've had... six leave since Jan 1st so far
[06:00:18] <Church> From our division at least.
[06:00:32] <Church> Which ain't surprising, there's churn after a merger.
[06:00:57] <Church> And one of them was destined to leave given his abilities heh, was only here to get us to the company exit.
[06:01:11] <Church> Actually make that possibly 7~ soon enough
[06:01:24] <imode> yikes.
[06:02:02] <Church> Eh, they wanted to pursue new roles
[06:02:07] <Church> Not surprising
[06:02:37] <Church> Especially not surprised Paul left. Bit too superstar for our outfit I think heh.
[06:26:57] <ngoldbaum> definitely love people talking seriously about the possibility of nuclear war
[06:26:59] <ngoldbaum> great week
[06:27:03] <ngoldbaum> fuck this shit

[06:45:40] <imode> ngoldbaum: don't buy into the fear. we're not that close.
[06:46:01] <ngoldbaum> we‚Äôre a lot closer than we were last week
[06:47:02] <imode> a step is not a leap, a leap is not a dive, a dive is not a drive, a drive is not a diner..
[06:47:16] <imode> ..something something guy fieri.
[06:47:39] <ngoldbaum> it doesn‚Äôt help that i‚Äôm home alone this weekend with the cats
[06:48:09] <imode> it's really easy to become personally invested in a conflict that more than likely will not affect you.
[06:48:24] <imode> especially because every single major news feed and aggregation site is pointing at this.
[06:48:36] <imode> root for the good guys. ignore everything else.
[06:48:56] <imode> once the dust settles, there will be some objective analyses and decent takes. right now it's just fear and loathing on the internet.
[06:50:15] <Church> Eyep
[06:50:37] <Church> I'm just having a cold one and hoping Dead Hand doesn't get triggered, accidentally or "accidentally"
[06:51:06] <imode> I don't think we'll even get to that point.
[06:51:34] <imode> oddly enough the preservation of our current way of life is pretty important to the people running things, oligarchs and all.
[06:51:51] <imode> government backed military forces aren't the only armed forces that exist.
[06:51:59] <ngoldbaum> fuck putin for taking the world hostage to work out his weird inter-slavic racial shit
[06:52:11] <imode> don't kink-shame him, ngoldbaum.
[06:53:06] <imode> we all have fetishes, it just turns out that in addition to scat, putin is interested in very specific genocidal tendencies.

[19:48:44] <kline> gerikson, if it makes you feel better, ukraine supplies like 90% of the worlds neon, which is needed for the HeNe lasers used in steppers
[19:49:29] <kline> im sure they will find reason to keep IC prices high
[19:50:20] <gerikson> kline: did not know that
[19:50:20] <cb> or grain....
[19:50:34] <cb> (which is why china's prob pissed - lots of grain imports from ukraine)
[19:50:35] <gerikson> is that why they needed the Mirya

[20:36:12] <ngoldbaum> i think that was modern warfare 2

[21:31:23] <river> epilys: hehe
[21:31:33] <epilys> that mission traumatized me. I hadn't realised I didn't need to shoot civilians so I did it

[22:21:46] <river> what is with people
[22:21:52] <river> what does this comment even mean
[22:30:38] <ngoldbaum> you‚Äôre criticizing f-droid so you‚Äôre implicitly criticizing gnu crazies
[22:31:17] <river> nag boxes ARE free software, here's the fucking door
[22:31:26] <river> i fucking hate free software
[22:32:01] <imode> F-Droid is the bare minimum, a convenience would be to archive/hotlink to older versions.
[22:32:12] <river> its always a losing game when you try to contrinbute
[22:32:44] <river> bare minimum - yeah
[22:32:53] <river> that describes most of free software
[22:33:30] <imode> go add versioning support backed by the internet archive.
[22:33:48] <imode> that's what someone will tell you to do.
[22:34:13] <river> internet archive... lol
[22:34:17] <river> that sounds like parody
[22:34:25] <river> but i believe it
[22:34:44] <imode> the problem, river, is who's going to take the initiative to add the feature you want. you hate free software because it doesn't respect feature requests unless a majority desire it, but the truth is that free software does target the minimum, and the minimum is usually all the majority needs.
[22:34:58] <imode> want vs. need, as it were.
[22:35:11] <imode> we needed a gplay competitor because there are apps google de-lists.
[22:35:12] <ngoldbaum> imode: you just made jason scott‚Äôs eye twitch telepathically, congratulations
[22:35:21] <river> yes i know :(
[22:35:31] <imode> ngoldbaum: I have a direct line to him, I can make it twitch directly. ;)
[22:35:56] <river> im also just sick of the free software community
[22:36:05] <river> extreminism isn't pretty
[22:36:16] <imode> no, but you'll need to be the one that changes that.
[22:36:29] <imode> seriously, who else is going to do it.
[22:36:47] <imode> you're talking about software ran and maintained by volunteers.
[22:36:49] <ngoldbaum> drew devault
[22:36:51] <imode> they have no obligation to you.
[22:37:01] <imode> you got this product for free.
[22:37:08] <imode> you're using this software for free.
[22:37:17] <river> lucky me :o)
[22:37:18] <imode> if you want anything more out of it, rally people together.
[22:37:35] <imode> the same collective action that led to that app being on your phone can be the one that adds the feature you want.
[22:37:37] <ngoldbaum> lmao i‚Äôm reminded of the fsf ranking of software forges, where sr.ht is ranked as a B because you‚Äôre allowed to host software that isn‚Äôt copylefted
[22:37:57] <imode> gotta love that copyleft adherance.
