[01:07:47] <flakland> one has to wonder if that overflow still exists on 64bit systems
[01:08:41] <bugweiser> I *think* that is why it has: sizeof(void*)==4
[01:09:34] <bugweiser> prior to the 2 ifs, it had this commented out part:
[01:09:37] <bugweiser> /if ((sizeof(void*)==4) && unlikely(length>LZ4_MAX_INPUT_SIZE)) goto _output_error;   /* overflow detection */
[01:10:31] <Decker> well depends on what the other things holding that value are... 
[01:10:38] <bugweiser> and LZ4_MAX_INPUT_SIZE constant was (and still is) set to 0x7e000000  (so 'arbitrary sizes' that the spec touts is actually slightly under 2 gb max
[01:10:41] <Decker> if there's ints it'll be an issue later

[01:40:42] <apotheon> . . . to whom?
[01:40:59] <dre> my naive understanding of rust is that it brings all of the niceties of static typing, dynamic langs, etc, and bring them into a compiled binary
[01:41:02] <moniker0> is ther e ahandy website about programmers who like to format the source tree and THEN undertake trivial changes and check back in after modifying 4 lines of code?

[01:41:28] <sonny> ?
[01:41:38] <apotheon> dre: That's an interesting image.
[01:41:48] <moniker0> dre: kotlin native is an llvm frontend 
[01:41:51] <flakland> so it's like a pointer to some "owner" the compiler uses and prevents any other code blocks from accessing the data on stack?

[04:45:48] <sonny> also, increase in memory size when you go to a larger register size, e.g. 32 to 64 bit
[04:46:07] <oldlaptop> sonny: Processors with N-bit registers tend to have N-bit pointers and address spaces for N>=16 or so, if that's what you mean
[04:46:25] <sonny> [itchyjunk]: sadly the copied it from the c switch for some reason

[04:46:42] <[itchyjunk]> so C switch runs all cases till it sees a return as well?

[04:48:26] <oldlaptop> Now you can't assume the virtual address space exposed to your program under a particular operating system and environment has any relationship to the virtual address space available to your program.
[04:48:46] <oldlaptop> (And that doesn't have any real relationship to how much physical memory the computer has either.)

[04:49:12] <tomathy> dudes gtk is too big

[04:49:28] <sonny> oldlaptop: what if it's a vm?
[04:49:35] <flakland> gtk2 was aight until they broke it with updates
[04:50:05] <jinsun> [itchyjunk]: it just jumps to the label that matches the thing you are switching on and runs all lines  after that (including the one ones that look like a part of a case below)

[04:50:43] <oldlaptop> sonny: that doesn't have anything in particular to do with it
[04:50:47] <jinsun> [itchyjunk]: to prevent running other cases you have to manually jump out with a break or return
[04:51:15] <[itchyjunk]> hmm that makes sense i think
[04:51:26] <[itchyjunk]> i had just expected it to run the case it matches and nothing else
[04:51:33] <[itchyjunk]> does py do it like java too?
[04:51:34] <tomathy> flakland: what GUI tools do you use?
[04:51:41] <[itchyjunk]> wonder if it's common thing for all languages
[04:51:44] <sonny> [itchyjunk] doubt it

[04:51:49] <sonny> it's not
[04:51:54] <[itchyjunk]> oh py doesn't do it? :<
[04:52:10] <sonny> py probably does what you are thinking
[04:52:16] <[itchyjunk]> ah
[04:52:29] <[itchyjunk]> case 'apple': only runs things inside the apple case
[04:52:35] <[itchyjunk]> i suppose
[04:52:37] <tomathy> do you recommend it flakland 
[04:52:39] <[itchyjunk]> hmm interesting
[04:53:02] <flakland> only if you're not afraid to read your own input devices
[04:53:58] <tomathy> is wiring the gui to the program always difficult?
[04:54:31] <tomathy> i never got my head around it
[04:54:36] <[itchyjunk]> We are building a tower defense games as a final and i am starting to get really lost with all that i have to do :<

[07:31:29] <oldlaptop> I'd expect the std::vector access to be slower, yes - but the way to be sure would be to profile it

[07:32:47] <Stryyker> What is wrong with vector?
[07:32:51] <oldlaptop> in any case, if the compiler can prove neither side of the && has side effects, it's none of your business which order it decides to evaluate them in
[07:33:06] <Gamah> if(value==failCondition && othervalue.back() ==passcondition) is better than having them swapped around &&?
[07:33:30] <Stryyker> if you have one that is more likely to fail, probably put that first
[07:33:42] <oldlaptop> Stryyker: nothing, but I'd guess offhand that a struct/class member access is a bit faster than an element access to a vector

[07:34:54] <oldlaptop> Gamah: I'm not comfortable asserting that the order even matters, because I don't know offhand if the compiler is allowed to assume the method call has no side effects.
[07:35:19] <Stryyker> I don't know what you actually have, hard to comment
[07:35:31] <Gamah> oh well.... it's not python anymore... so i'll just accept that code go brrr and deal with optimization after i have results...

[07:37:33] <Gamah> Stryyker: if you're interested to know... simulating blackjack, not here to sell you on it though
[07:37:38] <oldlaptop> Reasoning about this kind of low-level performance question is in practice very hard, especially on modern machines, which is why (a) there's an optimizing compiler to do a lot of that kind of thing for you, and (b) you use empirical profiler data to guide your decisions
[07:38:18] <Gamah> i guess i ought to educate myself more about what kind of optimizations modern compilers do
[07:38:38] <Gamah> most of my knowledge is based on interpreted langs.
[07:39:14] <oldlaptop> your job for the moment is more to choose good algorithms and so forth - using an n^2 algorithm where you could find an n*lg(n) algorithm instead is generally going to overwhelm micro-optimizations

[07:41:04] <oldlaptop> once you have something that works, you can start to think about where there might be inefficiencies, and start asking a profiler about them.
[07:41:05] <Gamah> correctly totaling a blackjack hand based on it's previous hard/soft state and the value of a new card is proving to be an annoying algorighm to solve....
[07:41:44] <Gamah> oldlaptop: i did that in python and it was array access that was killing me by a longshot so reimplementing from scratch in c++ has me afraid to even touch iterators.

[12:53:41] <feep[work]> hi
[12:54:11] <feep[work]> I ran into an issue with json-rpc where the fact that we had server notifications over a single connection, but also client requests and responses, meant that we were unable to provide backpressure on notifications
[12:54:24] <feep[work]> my question is: what's the *name* for that problem?
[12:54:45] *** Quits: dan01 (~dan01@88.84.165.182) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[12:54:52] <feep[work]> it sort of looks like the reverse of head-of-line blocking, ie. the fact that we have a long-running *asynchronous* request means we have to buffer an unlimited number of unrelated messages.
[12:58:25] <Samian> Does this make sense to you? "Cache generation occurs the first time --use-persistent-cache is enabled with a given config.  The speedup is observed during subsequent runs."   Is there anything you'd write differently? The "speedup is observed" part sounds a little weird.

[13:09:48] <feep[work]> Square: well, the point is, the client has no way to prioritize anything
[13:09:53] <feep[work]> it can't say no
[13:11:22] <Square> ok, so a normal synchronous client request could be answered by a "server notification"  
[13:11:26] <feep[work]> nono
[13:11:39] <feep[work]> notifications are asynchronous; the server can send them at any time for any reason
[13:11:44] <feep[work]> subscription is a request, it has a normal response
[13:11:52] <feep[work]> it just triggers the server to start sending (flooding) notifications

[13:15:18] <flakland> why does th e RPC take so long that it blocks out notifications
[13:15:26] <feep[work]> it's not a question of length
[13:15:40] <feep[work]> or rather, the problem isn't that the rpc take long, the problem is that notification sending is faster than processing at all.
[13:15:42] <flakland> its  a high notification protocol?

[13:16:39] <flakland> then don't fix it
[13:16:50] <feep[work]> the problem is that the client has no way to mitigate the spam.
[13:17:03] <flakland> mitigate normal operation?
[13:17:06] <feep[work]> I mean, by the same logic http downloads are spammy.
[13:17:13] <feep[work]> the server sends as fast as it can.

[13:20:34] <feep[work]> http/2 may have, I'm not sure how their push notifications work
[13:20:45] <feep[work]> http/3 definitely doesn't, because they use separate queues (<3)
[13:20:49] <flakland> this isn't on TCP?
[13:21:00] <feep[work]> it's on tcp, but tcp *as a protocol in itself* doesn't have the issue
[13:21:16] <feep[work]> tcp is a message dialog. jsonrpc is a message dialog on top of it.
[13:21:21] <flakland> it does if you design your application poorly
[13:22:04] <feep[work]> the tcp packet semantics don't have the issue, because the client can refuse to acknowledge a packet.
[13:22:16] <feep[work]> this is not an application issue.
[13:22:25] <feep[work]> it's a foundational issue with jsonrpc.

[15:24:26] <Decker> about99% of the cases
[15:24:34] <Decker> of infix operations
[15:26:10] <vdamewood> user51: It translates infix to a stack. So, as long as everything is binary infix.
[15:26:36] <vdamewood> ... but if you want to use something else, like prefix function calls, you're screwed.
[15:27:15] <Decker> I dunno you could probably just put a sort of delay-filter in there that can de-prefix things
[15:27:17] <user51> i hacked a postfix operator in, now trying unary minus
[15:27:26] <GeDaMo> I think it can deal with prefix too
[15:28:01] <Decker> I just know every time it was suggested it aplied to a syntax that was infix...
[15:28:39] <GeDaMo> There's an example on Wikipedia (scroll down a bit) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm#Detailed_example
[15:28:41] <bayaz> Title: Shunting-yard algorithm - Wikipedia 
[15:28:42] <vdamewood> I wrote a recursive-descent parser for infix twice.

Currently my ci/cd actions just long into the target machines, pull new code from github, and restart. My ansible playbook actually setups the whole vps environment before hand. Does it
[16:29:39] <carldev31> make sense to actually recreate the whole envrionment on every master push with ansible via ci/cd? Im not sure how to integrate these two workflows.

[17:05:43] <Twix> you need a asymmetric cryptosystem, francogrex. PGP Works quite well. A alternative if you want to build your own stuff around some library would be nacl/libsodium, which uses Curve25519 for signing and encryption.

[17:09:05] <Twix> an signature is basically a hash of the document and then cryptographic magic using a asymmetric cipher.
[17:09:26] <Twix> In asymmetric cipher suites, you have two keys. One private and one public
[17:09:41] <Twix> the private one is kept secret and the public one is made public

[17:10:09] <Twix> you need the private key to create a signature and the public one to check if the signature is legit
[17:10:17] <francogrex> ok
[17:10:32] <Twix> pgp/opengpg is a ready to use system
[17:11:59] <Twix> nacl/libsodium is a simpler and more modern system, intended for use in your own software. But you can also use opengpg in your software, but the interfaces to nacl are simpler
[17:12:00] <francogrex> ok and just for completing my understanding: it allows two people to co-sign the same document? 
[17:12:10] <Twix> you can just create two signature
[17:12:36] <Twix> or as much as you like
[17:12:54] <francogrex> and is there a way to hold the party who signed responsible if at a certain point during a litigation she/he may deny ever signing off?
[17:13:29] <francogrex> or does that require an overseeing third party?
[17:13:42] <Twix> only the private key can create a signature
[17:13:51] <Twix> to a public key
[17:14:21] <Twix> but a party could "accidentially" loose their private key and make it public

[19:42:23] <pulse> I'll go live in maybe a week, two tops
[19:42:39] <pyzozord> nice!
[19:42:42] <pyzozord> classy
[19:42:48] <pulse> Thoughts/opinions appreciated, also if you want to jump onboard as a mod I'd love to have you
[19:42:50] <pulse> No pressure though
[19:42:51] <pyzozord> oh wow, so quick?
[19:42:52] <pulse> Totally up to you
[19:43:02] <pulse> Yeah, I already got the domain set up, just need to figure out
[19:43:14] <pulse> I spent all night yesterday fixing various phpBB theme bugs
[19:43:15] <pyzozord> totally can jump on
[19:43:32] <pulse> It's almost workable now but I have work related stuff do attend to now
[19:43:38] <pulse> Cool
[19:44:11] <pyzozord> hah yes pesky work distracting us from the real projects :D
[19:44:17] <pulse> :P
[19:44:25] <pulse> I'm gonna make internet great again
[19:44:27] <pulse> With phpBB

[19:44:44] <pulse> Also I've registered #indiedevs which will be the IRC side of it

[19:46:08] *** Joins: JanC (~janc@user/janc)
[19:46:11] <pyzozord> I have two pieces of criticism if you are interested

[19:46:25] <bayaz> Title: Edit fiddle - JSFiddle - Code Playground 
[19:46:59] <pyzozord> 1) it's completly personal, but I'd love a dark theme
[19:47:44] <pyzozord> 2) I'd get programming into it's own category and give it topics, since I think that's what we usually focus on
[19:48:48] <pyzozord> I still love the theme it's very neat
[19:48:53] <pulse> Yeah for 1. basically I want some kind of identity so this will be the default. But phpBB supports custom themes per user so technically someone could turn this theme into a dark one and then every user could just select. But there's usability problems with it. I'd personally prefer light mode only but I get that some people are all about darkmode
[19:49:06] <pulse> For 2, yeah. Maybe. Subforums are a thing too so Programming could have a bunch of them
[19:49:08] <pyzozord> you know what actually disregard 1) I can use Dark Reader chrome extension
[19:49:25] <pulse> But I don't want to completely oversaturate with sub-boards because idk if it will take off or not
[19:49:33] <pulse> Thanks for input though

[19:49:51] <pulse> The plan is to get something workable live, and then it can evolve over time
[19:50:01] <pulse> From my experience forums rarely stay exactly the same over the course of years
[19:50:04] *** Quits: amigojapan (uid86330@id-86330.helmsley.irccloud.com) ()
[19:51:03] <pyzozord> my point about 2) was to kind of signal "hey, we are all about programming here, we do other stuff too of course, but only after we did all programming"
[19:51:16] <pyzozord> but that might be not your target
[19:51:21] <pulse> Hehe
[19:51:26] <pulse> That's why it's the 1st :D
[19:51:38] <pulse> Yeah I want a broad creative board
[19:51:53] <pulse> I could do a separate category for programming but idk if it's worth it
[19:52:00] <pulse> I expect the community will be rather tight at the beginning
[19:52:22] <pyzozord> In collabs you can probably add gamejams, those seem popular these days
[19:52:29] <pulse> But the thing is, TIGSource is showing signs of dying so if a chunk of those users come, then it will be a really cozy place
[19:52:38] <pulse> pyzozord, Yeah those should be under Events I think
[19:52:43] <pulse> I should add a bunch of descriptions
[19:52:56] <pyzozord> oh right
[19:52:58] <pulse> Anyway this is just a first draft, far from finalized

[19:53:17] <pyzozord> I think I'd maybe then display subforums on this main home page
[19:53:31] <pyzozord> unless there is going to be so many that it will be really overwhelming
[19:53:43] <pyzozord> but i'd like to be 1 click away from the forum I want
[19:53:57] <pulse> From my community building experience it's best to go small
[19:54:02] <pulse> Even this many forums idk if it's a good idea
[19:54:10] <pulse> It's a bit of a catch22
[19:54:21] <pulse> You need content, but you need users to generate content, but you don't have users until you have content
[19:54:44] <pyzozord> I'm just going to totally off of my personal preferences and just stream of conciouseness atm
[19:55:58] <pyzozord> I have to say I'm looking forward to getting on board, it would be awesome to have some async discussion place
[19:56:11] <pyzozord> hopefully other folks from here will jump on too
[19:56:33] <pyzozord> this would perfectly compliment #programming
[19:56:38] <pulse> I'm mainly hoping the TIGSource crowd finds it xD

[19:56:40] <pyzozord> ##
[19:56:48] <pulse> But I don't want to advertise it, it's unnatural
[19:56:52] <[itchyjunk]> traditionally, you start with as few as possible subforms
[19:56:53] <pulse> Word of mouth is the way to go
[19:57:00] <[itchyjunk]> and as the context grows, manually move 
[19:57:05] <pulse> [itchyjunk], Yeah but that approach can backfire too
[19:57:08] <[itchyjunk]> it's a bit more work in management size
[19:57:12] <pulse> I have experience with that
[19:57:18] <[itchyjunk]> but it improved user interactions
[19:57:35] <pulse> You can have a small forum and it's not organized enough, and then a lot of people join and you have to then manually separate content
[19:57:37] <pulse> And it's painful
[19:57:44] <pyzozord> wow they have quite a few posts there on tig
[19:57:46] <pulse> Needs a balance
[19:57:52] <[itchyjunk]> only till you have a few users
[19:57:57] <pulse> pyzozord, Yeah it's a large community. But it's dying because admin drama
[19:58:05] <pulse> It used to have 100s of active users, now it has 1-10 active users
[19:58:08] <[itchyjunk]> if your active user count is below a few dozen, it hardly matters.
[19:58:15] <pulse> So it's the best possible time to make a new community
[19:58:26] <pulse> [itchyjunk], Yeah I agree. We'll see how it goes
[19:58:55] <[itchyjunk]> from what i remember, there are way to move the posts and such via the admin tools in the softwares (i used) at least
[19:59:09] <[itchyjunk]> so i used to see what topics picked up more users and seperated that
[19:59:17] <[itchyjunk]> 10 mins wasted but worked out nice
[19:59:34] <davve> so there is this quote about functions about how its better to have a lot of them that work on the same type rather than a lot of different ones, does anyone know who/what im thinking of?

[20:04:07] <pyzozord> true, I also learned from watching people like Jon Blow and Casey Muratori that game devs also like to _write_ tools
[20:04:14] <pulse> Yep
[20:04:22] <pyzozord> like they write debug tools which was a shock to me
[20:04:32] <pulse> Why was that shocking
[20:04:39] <pulse> It's common to write graphics related tools
[20:04:43] <pulse> Like sprite tester etc.
[20:04:46] <pyzozord> I was always "i must solve all problems only with tools I was provided the compiler and the debugger"

[20:05:41] <pulse> It's a way to put all assets into a bunch of datafiles and then easily extract them ingame

[20:33:03] <pyzozord> it's honestly fairly easy to sustain oneself on dignified level

[20:35:35] <[itchyjunk]> dodo, idk what that even means
[20:35:44] <[itchyjunk]> like learning js includes node.js things?
[20:35:46] <[itchyjunk]> then no
[20:35:49] <[itchyjunk]> just the language
[20:35:52] <pyzozord> nice, I think mine too, but it was Borland Delphi 7
[20:36:26] <pyzozord> in some way I'm kind of proud that "I go so far back I know languages that are dead now"
[20:36:28] <dodo> well, with just the language you can hardly create any projects
[20:36:29] <norias> borland C++ on maybe win95?
[20:36:37] <pyzozord> although I don't really remember anything about Delphi syntax
[20:36:59] <[itchyjunk]> what? most things in py and haskell i did didn't have any additional package

[20:37:47] <[itchyjunk]> deniska, being able to do small projects!

[20:37:58] <dodo> some of us actively avoid js :)
[20:38:09] <pulse> Some of us earn our living with JS so we can't avoid it :P
[20:38:16] <deniska> [itchyjunk]: it's harder to create a project from scratch than to make sniper edits to someone else's code :)
[20:38:17] <dodo> i feel that
[20:38:22] <[itchyjunk]> earn living strictly as a js coder?
[20:38:33] <pyzozord> hah, i'm one of the ones who can't avoid js
[20:38:52] <[itchyjunk]> deniska, just curious as to how quickly people pick up new languages
[20:38:57] <deniska> I kinda like JS, in the same way I like strong beers, but still
[20:39:11] <[itchyjunk]> fucks you up quicker?
[20:39:15] <pulse> I like JS, but I don't like how vague the codebase turns out
[20:39:18] <norias> i'm surprised web stuff pays well
[20:39:21] <dodo> [itchyjunk]: i mean, once you know a few languages.. there's basically only some syntax to learn
[20:39:32] <pulse> C++ has a very stable feeling, JS has a very flimsy feeling
[20:39:37] <deniska> it's bad for your body, honestly doesn't even taste that good, but oh boy sometimes it feels like using some JS is a great idea :)
[20:39:43] <[itchyjunk]> dodo, like java to godot scripting, how transferable is that skill?
[20:39:44] <pikapika> Theres a difference between learning a language and "writing C in any language"
[20:39:45] <dodo> so you could "learn" it in five minutes if you keep a cheatsheet around
[20:39:47] <[itchyjunk]> hypothetically speaking
[20:39:47] <pulse> But it's hard to find good paying C++ jobs, meanwhile JS jobs literally randomly hit you in the head
[20:39:49] <pyzozord> I'm looking forward to break out to some more "serious programming" field though to be honest
[20:40:08] <pyzozord> something that will be more challanging. Maybe back to web backend, although not sure about that

[20:42:07] <norias> pulse: ahh. i'm not working in the field right now, just finishing school
[20:42:18] <pyzozord> I think js pays well because it's the language for web interfaces. And web is the most accessible platform for software distribution
[20:42:29] <pulse> [itchyjunk], It's an umbrella term so it could be interpreted in various ways, but yes, normally embedded = microcontrollers
[20:42:30] <norias> pulse: but i search for jobs i find interesting
[20:42:38] <pyzozord> so access to lots of people, lots of people don't know how to use software, so they need nice buttons

[20:43:34] <pulse> You can technically do web projects in C++, at least backend
[20:43:40] <norias> dodo: i wouldn't mind that
[20:43:47] <pulse> Well, with emscripten you can do frontends too, but it's weird
[20:44:05] <norias> dodo: i dunno why. i have an irrational dislike of web stuff
[20:44:11] <pulse> But a C++ backend will take you 5000 lines of code for something that you can do in 10 lines with node
[20:45:15] <pyzozord> js is much easier to learn, so there is bigger talent pool
[20:45:55] <pyzozord> yet the demand on software still outpaces the other thing

[21:06:12] <Decker> (although in opengl3+ they are paramount and about the only thing left in opengl at the same time)
[21:06:13] <[itchyjunk]> but only the blob can talk to hardware right? and opengl is code to manupulate this blob
[21:06:26] <Decker> it's just source
[21:06:45] <Decker> opengl is the interface to make the blob do things
[21:06:54] <[itchyjunk]> right, that's how i was thining about it
[21:07:01] <GeDaMo> OpenGL is an API; there is a library of code which implements the OpenGL API and communicates with the GPU
[21:07:08] <[itchyjunk]> if the blob itself had api, it would be something like CUDA right?
[21:07:23] <Decker> no, it's opengl
[21:07:23] <GeDaMo> CUDA is another API

[21:09:13] <[itchyjunk]> by blob i mean some machine code that we don't know about
[21:09:25] <GeDaMo> The blob is a device driver
[21:09:33] <[itchyjunk]> like hardware people say how cpu's load a blob which loads stuff like ram and then your os gets loaded
[21:09:38] <[itchyjunk]> ah device driver
[21:09:47] <[itchyjunk]> so OpenGL talks to device driver
[21:09:49] <[itchyjunk]> right?
[21:09:54] <Decker> yes
[21:09:57] <[itchyjunk]> and CUDA also talks to device driver?
[21:10:02] <Decker> yes
[21:10:04] <[itchyjunk]> or is it device driver itself?
[21:10:06] <[itchyjunk]> oh okay
[21:10:45] <[itchyjunk]> so we don't have opensource device driver for nvidia, just an opensource code that can talk to the device driver?

[21:12:01] <[itchyjunk]> i forget where asm language fits in. asm is just like any other language that gets compiled to machine code later by some compiler right?
[21:12:23] <Decker> it's a family of languages... but ya
[21:12:33] <Decker> it's not 'a' language
[21:12:34] <GeDaMo> asm tends to be much closer to machine code than languages like C
[21:13:04] <[itchyjunk]> so CUDA lets users to talk to GPU registers and such directly?
[21:13:17] <norias> my understanding is that's why you need nvcc instead of gcc
[21:13:21] <Decker> well cuda borrows from glsl so the code you write is more C like
[21:13:21] <[itchyjunk]> sounds like a rough way to work with GPU's
[21:13:37] <norias> to generate the code for the gpu
[21:13:44] <[itchyjunk]> nvcc is a different compiler?

[22:16:43] <pulse> I think last time I heard about Ruby was literally 10 years ago
[22:16:54] <sonny> rails seems popular
[22:17:02] <sonny> lobste.rs is made in rails
[22:17:09] <apotheon> pulse: Ruby is actually still in heavy use.
[22:17:12] <Gamah> previously i was comparing the total of the 2nd card added to the iterator and if it matched the value of the hand already, i'd set a bool to true for "isPair" this left the 6,6 vs A,A problem of both being pairs and a value of 12.... but then it hit me, just make isPair an int and use the value of the card as the value of the pair...
[22:17:19] <pulse> apotheon, Interesting
[22:17:19] <Gamah> ruby is all over 
[22:17:41] <apotheon> The hype phase is over, though.
[22:18:29] <apotheon> JavaScript fads have eaten into its popularity, though, so it's not quite what it was at its peak, as far as I'm aware.
[22:18:49] <apotheon> I think JavaScript has managed to eat into the popularity of almost everything, though.
[22:19:11] <[itchyjunk]> apotheon, my other class for today got moved to zoom
[22:19:33] <furrykef> Gamah: Funny enough, I learned just last night that a game I've been playing, Overboard!, includes a game of Pontoon. I'm curious if it might be theoretically beatable... assuming, of course, that the dealer doesn't cheat.
[22:19:34] <sonny> I'm curious, why does language popularity matter? So people can get free open source libraries made for them?
[22:19:42] <[itchyjunk]> so 4 hour commute for my java clcass sessm like a waste of time
[22:19:45] <Decker> the ruby community wonders if any other language still exists

[22:19:51] <[itchyjunk]> apotheon, ^
[22:19:53] <Gamah> never heard of pontoon
[22:20:00] <pulse> A language without a flourishing ecosystem loses usefulness over time
[22:20:06] <sonny> pulse: yeah, that's what I am thinking about
[22:20:21] <furrykef> Gamah: It's basically a blackjack variant, or more precisely, blackjack and pontoon appear to be siblings
[22:20:27] <apotheon> sonny: because of an instinctive desire to be "on the winning team".
[22:20:33] <apotheon> s/.$//
[22:20:41] <Gamah> furrykef: do they shuffle every hand? then it's not beatable.
[22:20:45] <Decker> FOMO
[22:20:50] <sonny> ah
[22:20:52] <apotheon> [itchyjunk]: Oh, definitely a waste of time just for Java.

[22:21:18] <sonny> pulse: having an ecosystem isn't that difficult
[22:21:30] <furrykef> sonny: For one thing, if I want to bring in another programmer, it's much easier to find a good one who already knows the language if the language is popular

[22:21:42] <sonny> heh
[22:21:50] <furrykef> For another, interoperability is a big concern
[22:22:02] <sonny> furrykef: I don't think that matters personally
[22:22:04] <furrykef> Library bindings for unpopular languages tend to go out of date
[22:22:12] <furrykef> Why don't you?
[22:22:14] <sonny> but I can't proove it, so *shrugs*
[22:22:39] <sonny> a good programmer can be trained in another language relativley quickly
[22:22:45] <pulse> Yeah, that's true
[22:22:48] <sonny> and that does not prevent him from solving problems
[22:22:55] <pulse> Like, if I had to use Ruby, I'm sure I could pick it up within a week or so
[22:23:00] <sonny> they can still read stack traces, etc
[22:23:03] <pulse> I'm just wondering why I never hear about Ruby
[22:23:03] <apotheon> pulse: easily
[22:23:11] <apotheon> if you're a good programmer
[22:23:12] <Gamah> this is probably an unpopular opinion... but i'd pick someone who knows only one language and is able to demonstrate strong critical thinking skills for a project in a language they've never touched vs someone who claims to know all the popular languages and can ace typical algorithm interview questions.
[22:23:16] <furrykef> Gamah: It could be if the odds are chosen poorly. Single-deck blackjack's house edge is actually much smaller than casinos intended when played just with basic strategy.
[22:23:23] <pulse> Instead I hear about all these esoteric languages like https://ziglang.org/
[22:23:23] <bayaz> Title: Home โก Zig Programming Language 
[22:23:55] <pulse> Not technically esoteric but just recent
[22:23:58] <apotheon> pulse: static languages are on the rise in the zeitgeist
[22:23:59] <sonny> there are only a few languages that will require mastery or in depth knowledge, which is mostly c++
[22:24:04] <Gamah> furrykef: if they shuffle every hand, single deck is only beatable if there's at least 1 other player, and you are second, and the margin of that is not very high... finding a single deck game that deals 4-5 rounds is much more profitable
[22:24:04] <pulse> apotheon, Hmm
[22:24:23] <apotheon> pulse: . . . and people are eager to predict the "next big language"
[22:24:48] <apotheon> C++ might actually be on its way to replacement, though.
[22:24:50] <pulse> Some have claimed Rust is it
[22:24:54] <pulse> apotheon, Lol. No
[22:25:01] <pulse> Both C and C++ are here to stay
[22:25:03] <Gamah> apotheon: my favorite lang of 2018 was fortran 2015
[22:25:16] <furrykef> Rust is the only language I've seen lately that truly brings something new to the table
[22:25:22] <apotheon> Most static languages lately are partial replacements for C++.  If this keeps up, we'll see some that are effectively full replacements.
[22:25:30] <furrykef> Everything else seems to be a rehash of other languages
[22:25:31] <sonny> furrykef: what was the interoperability point?
[22:25:38] <apotheon> C itself would be more difficult to replace, given the way people think about language design.
[22:25:38] <Gamah> rust doesn't do anything new, it just does it semantically more cleanly
[22:26:00] <sonny> sometimes, you need new culture, engineering, which is how google got go

[22:26:55] <apotheon> That's one aspect.
[22:26:59] <paku> shooting your own foot is C's feature
[22:27:04] <apotheon> nope
[22:27:10] <pulse> Sometimes you shoot other people's foots with C
[22:27:17] <furrykef> My choices are to use the old bindings, spend months updating the bindings, or use a different language
[22:27:24] <apotheon> You can do that in any language, though C's approach to helping you shoot yourself in the foot is certainly colorful.
[22:27:32] <furrykef> (Or spend even more months writing completely new bindings)

[22:28:23] <furrykef> This is not just hypothetical, I've run into exactly this sort of problem
[22:28:25] <sonny> makes sense
[22:28:28] <apotheon> C++ makes it impossible to shoot yourself in the foot by ensuring that every time you aim it at your foot it vaporizes your whole leg.

[22:30:40] <apotheon> K&R is pretty clear, but it expects the reader to absorb the point by osmosis, unfortunately, which doesn't work for many people.
[22:30:41] <norias> i remember thinking... i've painted myself in to a corner
[22:30:45] <sonny> rust has a new concept called borrow checking etc
[22:30:47] <norias> then went... goto !
[22:31:04] <furrykef> sonny: That's literally what we're discussing right now.
[22:31:08] <oldlaptop> (well, maybe not *strictly* by definition. The most recent significant spec revision was only around ten years ago.)
[22:31:31] <sonny> I was replying to "so rust nor c does anything interesting"

[22:31:36] <oldlaptop> Its fundamental concepts can't possibly be very "new" by computing-industry standards, because it and its fundamental concepts date to the 1970s.
[22:31:53] <oldlaptop> (or earlier, of course, for the concepts that weren't original in the 1970s)
[22:32:03] <apotheon> sonny: Someoen already brought up borrow checking as an answer to that, though.

[22:34:47] <sonny> the example for c is more appropriate given algol

[22:35:13] <oldlaptop> just because the same thing could be accomplished less cleanly or without as many safety checks with bar doesn't mean foo is uninteresting or useless or unoriginal

[22:36:22] <Gamah> i get the sentiment behind it
[22:36:29] <oldlaptop> I can't comment offhand on how original rust's distinctive features are to it - there's prior art for a lot of things, especially in toy research languages.
[22:36:34] <Gamah> it added a lot of tedium imo tho sonny 
[22:36:36] <sonny> what is it?
[22:36:54] <Gamah> rusts immutability
[22:37:09] <oldlaptop> It *is* breaking ground in the sense of getting some of those features into classes of programs that didn't use them before.
[22:37:10] <sonny> rust prior art is from 2003-06, but it did not make it out of acadamia
[22:37:27] <sonny> what is the sentiment?
[22:37:37] <Gamah> that immutability makes safer code
[22:37:45] <Gamah> especially if it's the compiler enforcing it
[22:37:53] <oldlaptop> (You might as well argue - technically correctly - that there was nothing particularly original or interesting about, say, the Ford Model T, but you would be delusional to claim on that basis that it wasn't important)

[22:39:44] <lantech19446> I was studying webdev for the last several months but now I feel like my opportunities to get into that industry aren't great and I'm thinking that maybe programming would be a better route. I know I need to build a portfolio, I know I should contribute to open source projects and get a few commits under my belt before I start applying to jobs so that I have something to show for my skills. I
[22:39:45] <sonny> oldlaptop: why's that?
[22:39:46] <lantech19446> also understand that hello world and other school assignments are a dime a dozen and not portfolio quality coding so I know this will take time, I'm not looking for a job tomorrow. My ideal timeline is about a year to a year and a half. My question is should I continue on my path to learn javascript or is python a better choice?
[22:40:01] <sonny> language devs don't trust distros or the OS
[22:40:03] <Gamah> oldlaptop: i was specifically avoiding bringing cargo into it because it didn't feel fair.
[22:40:27] <Decker> how do you excluse the standard package library from the language? not fair?
[22:41:09] <oldlaptop> sonny: Partly because I don't want random things downloading random crap from the Internet behind my back during the build process whenever they feel like it, and partly because I trust "distros or the OS" to get packaging right much more than I trust Joe Sixpack who just uploaded some random thing to pypi, or crates.io, or whatever the hell it is
[22:41:21] <Gamah> lantech19446: i started as a SQL developer with less than 1000 lines of code of portfolio and less than a year of exposure to databases... got in through a contracting gig, maybe give that a shot to build the portfolio
[22:41:22] <apotheon> lantech19446: If you're new to coding, try to stick to a single language for a couple years.
[22:41:29] <apotheon> lantech19446: You need time to learn a little depth.
[22:41:34] <sonny> yeah that's a good analysis 
[22:41:59] <apotheon> lantech19446: Sticking to that is more important than specific language choice, at least within the pool of generally acceptable languages in widespread use.
[22:42:09] <Gamah> oldlaptop: speaking of cargo... is there any offline way to include all your own libs from disk and tell it to fuck off about talking to the internet?
[22:42:11] <lantech19446> Gamah: so you were doing like back end dev type stuff?
[22:42:14] <apotheon> Note that picking PHP as your first is somewhat limiting.
[22:42:19] <oldlaptop> and if I'm going outside the OS's package manager (I understand windows and macOS people don't have OS package managers worth two excretions, and that's too bad for them), I want to know and control what the hell is going on.
[22:42:23] <sonny> lantech19446: the advice here is usally to build something, open source is a lot of work

[22:43:11] <Decker> tS
[22:43:15] <oldlaptop> Gamah: I would assume so, and would also assume it's not particularly easy. I think the last cargo enthusiast I asked about this was maintaining some kind of private mirror of all the crate stuff.
[22:43:20] <Gamah> nobody's going to agree with me, but the language won't matter if you're actually driven to learn and solve problems
[22:43:24] <apotheon> If you're already working with it, and don't hate it, you might as well stick with it.
[22:43:25] <lantech19446> damn Gamah that's some fortunate falling
[22:43:42] <apotheon> I mean, JavaScript has its negatives, and I personally loathe those negatives, but that's beside the point.
[22:43:51] <apotheon> Find me a language without negatives.

[22:59:00] <derjanni> I would like to share my scientific observations on noobs. My findings are that I have found 2 different species of noobs: A) the instructed noob that only performs tasks with a computer that he/she is instructed to B) the insane dunning-kruger-early-stage noob that uses a computer up to complete insanity and configures the machine in a way that makes it inoperable and perform absolute nonsense.

[22:59:39] <Gamah> no idea what allstar is, but python can probably do this with a lot of exising libraries
[22:59:47] <norias> apotheon: how so ( as someone in college this seems very relevant )
[23:00:05] <lantech19446> allstar is an amateur radio service that uses repeaters connected to the internet to talk all over the world

[23:27:38] <apotheon> The missus has to deal with the paucity of good tooling around that stuff all the time.
[23:27:42] <arahael> there are plenty of source control options with CI integration and all that...  but with DBMS dev it's a very different situation.

[23:30:00] <oldlaptop> apotheon: Oh, now you've gone and done it. MSSQL's "management studio" thing has a genetic relationship to visual studio, so some visual studio fan is going to come here convinced that it's terrific and the best database-related tool ever devised

[23:30:28] <oldlaptop> dammit!
[23:30:31] <apotheon> It's generally easier to get code from PostgreSQL into version control than from Oracle, from what I've seen.
[23:30:36] <Gamah> arahael: 68,433 concurrent users
[23:31:24] <Gamah> we haven't fully vetted postgres but it looks like it will be usable now they have some of the featurse that MSSQL has had for decades.
[23:31:30] <apotheon> oldlaptop: I suspect that Intellisense is actually probably better than equivalents elsewhere, generally, but that still doesn't add up to much.
[23:31:32] <arahael> Gamah: obviously postgres for some use cases and sqlite for other use cases.  eg, right now i am using sqlite because there is no reason to install a db server on a... phone...
[23:31:35] <Gamah> HA/failover is still yet to be determined tho
[23:32:02] <Gamah> arahael: agree... and niether postgres or sqlite ticked all the boxes we've needed.
[23:32:05] <arahael> Gamah: pg's model has always been to have those additional features as external addons.
[23:32:07] <Gamah> postgrest might, soon
[23:32:17] <Gamah> yeah and those addons suck
[23:32:19] <apotheon> Yeah, I like the postgres for some, SQLite for others, approach.

[23:34:18] <Gamah> i'd hear them but i don't believe they'd be any good
[23:34:20] <oldlaptop> there are a hell of a lot of client-server database installations (probably *mostly* mysql?) that ought to be sqlite
[23:34:30] <arahael> Gamah: if you're big enough to be able to consider dedicated db managers, you're in a different game.
[23:34:38] <Gamah> oldlaptop: like all of wordpress? lol
[23:34:51] <apotheon> Gamah: I think the reason SpaceX uses MS SQL Server is Elon being kind of a dipshit about Microsoft.
[23:34:53] <Gamah> arahael: yes sorry i wasn't clear about that before.
[23:35:07] <Gamah> apotheon: if it wasn't mssql they'd be using oracle, which is also shite
[23:35:14] <Gamah> postgres just doesn't scale for the kind of stuff they're doing
[23:35:29] <Gamah> same with valve, imo
[23:35:38] <arahael> Gamah: you sure about that?
[23:35:55] <Gamah> i mean valve is in the same position as us... they just always have been a microsoft shop since before postgres was relevant
[23:36:01] <arahael> because in the recent decade they have been excellenr.
[23:36:02] <oldlaptop> Gamah: Probably not *every* wordpress installation in existence, exactly...
[23:36:03] <apotheon> Gamah: I dunno.  Elon might be amenable to PostgreSQL if he wasn't such a Microsoftie.
[23:36:10] <oldlaptop> (just the other 99.9% of them)
[23:36:25] <Gamah> oldlaptop: now how's nitpicking someone's comments? lol

[23:37:03] <oldlaptop> Something something exceptions that prove the rule something?
[23:37:11] <apotheon> The Model T's assembly line was a significant contributor to its success.
[23:37:18] <Gamah> definitely
[23:37:24] <apotheon> It brought the availability of the cars up, and the price down.
[23:37:24] <Gamah> the assembly line was novel and new
[23:37:36] <oldlaptop> "Come on, there must be at least, what, three or four wordpress installations in the wild that need a client/server DB"
[23:37:49] <Gamah> yeah but those shouldn't be wordpress sites then
[23:37:57] <oldlaptop> No argument
[23:38:00] <Gamah> :)
[23:38:14] <apotheon> Even WordPress is beginning to realize there's no excuse for PHP.  Much of WordPress is JavaScript now.
[23:38:15] <oldlaptop> (but in somewhat more seriousness some of them are anyway)
[23:38:16] <Gamah> then you have reddit...
[23:38:24] <Gamah> which until i think 2015? 2016? was a single DB table in mysql
[23:38:26] <apotheon> I don't know if that has improved things at all, though.
[23:38:33] <apotheon> It's still WordPress.
[23:39:02] <apotheon> Gamah: That's horrifying.

[23:53:57] <arahael> literally the only systems where sqlite is avoided tends to be those systems that don't use C, and there's not many of those.

[23:54:57] <oldlaptop> I don't think any of the free BSDs have sqlite in the base system anymore. (openbsd used to, for mandoc)
[23:55:03] <arahael> bdb is basically just key-value.
