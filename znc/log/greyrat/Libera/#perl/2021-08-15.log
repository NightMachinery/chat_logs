[01:21:33] <ether> Nei: of course it isn't; why would you think that?

[01:22:29] <Nei> "elected manager of the entire Perl language" resigns?
[01:22:42] <Nei> sounds relevant to technical things to me
[01:23:23] <LeoNerd> TPF are primarily a legal/marketing entity, and aren't at all involved in the actual technical *writing* of the language

[01:57:47] <gryphn> OK, I'm trying not to care, by why would your comment get downvoted? It's highly informative and includes references as backup.
[01:57:56] <Grinnz> your guess is as good as mine
[01:58:19] <ehuelsmann[m]> well, it doesn't confirm the picture people want to believe: that Perl is dead.
[01:58:49] <gryphn> I feel like there's this weird, perverse need to see Perl burn, which confuses me. Why would someone who has decided not to use Perl care about Perl?
[01:59:07] <Grinnz> the eternal question
[01:59:33] <ehuelsmann[m]> never mind that AWK isn't a comparison, by community or functionality, but people apparently think that choosing an AWK solution has a better future than a Perl solution.
[01:59:53] <ehuelsmann[m]> Never mind that both Perl and Common Lisp code written 30 years ago, still works today.
[02:00:08] <ehuelsmann[m]> (although granted, the same can probably be said of AWK code)
[02:01:02] <ether> people like having something they can hate
[02:01:20] <ether> it's not cool to hate on a different race or gender anymore, so they turn to other things
[02:01:42] <gryphn> I'm trying to think of an analogous reverse hate. Like, is there a language Perl folks love to hate on? I mean, there are languages I loath to code in, but if someone else is able to be effective and efficient building stuff in them, well, good on them. Why should I care?
[02:01:44] <ether> it's better if it's something that obviously doesn't really matter, like sports teams

[03:08:28] <Grinnz> that's just a funny way to write $var[...]

[03:39:35] <skered> Grinnz: Ok that's what I thought.
[03:39:46] <skered> I'm trying to track down a vim syntax bug
[03:40:03] <skered> And it seems to have issues with unclosed cases of ${var}[...
[03:40:33] <skered> It appears if ${var} isn't an array then the [ is just a character and used as such.
[03:40:59] <skered> It seems the syntax file thinks that all cases of ${var}[... is an array and expects a closing ]
[03:44:35] <skered> Grinnz: However, your example is what the real code I'm reviewing is coded.  It's using [ in an escape seq.
[03:45:25] *** Joins: gast0n (~g4570n@user/gast0n)
[03:45:59] <skered> So it started as.. an issue in a perl script, finding an issue with vim perl syntax, to understanding perl's ${var}[ when $var isn't an array, to now.  hah
[03:45:59] <Grinnz> ah, yeah, it seems if the parser doesn't know of an array by that name it will allow it to be a scalar
[03:46:04] <Grinnz> while interpolating, only
[03:46:14] <Grinnz> that's kinda fucked
[03:46:16] <LeoNerd> Ohgod..really?
[03:46:28] <Grinnz> only with the ${var} syntax too, it doesn't happen with $var
[03:46:28] <LeoNerd> Yet another in the qq() is crazy bucket
[03:46:56] <LeoNerd> eval: my $var = "scalar"; my @var = ("array");  qq(${var}[0])
[03:46:57] <perlbot> LeoNerd: scalar[0]
[03:47:08] <Grinnz> in a serious perl script, i'd eitehr use $var or escape that [ regardless
[03:47:22] <LeoNerd> I'm pretty sure that ${...} will stop at that point
[03:47:48] <Grinnz> oh it just doesn't take subscripts entirely?
[03:47:51] <Grinnz> the fuck
[03:47:52] <LeoNerd> eval: my @var = ("array");  qq(${var}[0])
[03:47:53] <perlbot> LeoNerd: [0]
[03:48:15] <LeoNerd> eval: my @var = ("array");  qq(array subsscripts interpolate fine as $var[0])
[03:48:17] <perlbot> LeoNerd: array subsscripts interpolate fine as array
[03:48:22] <LeoNerd> Just not with {braces}
[03:48:48] <Grinnz> skered: congrats on teaching us something new about perl
[03:49:43] <Grinnz> skered: so to be clear for the syntax file, ${var}[ is only an array access when not interpolated
[03:49:44] <skered> My job is done then.
[03:50:25] <Grinnz> (hash key access probably works the same)
[03:50:33] <skered> Well I think the author of the syntax needs to know that.  I'm going to file a bug.

[16:49:08] <LeoNerd> Encoding

[16:49:43] <haj> echo "abc שלום edf" | perl -CS -pe 's/\P{Hebrew}+//gu'
[16:50:13] <haj> (In this case, that's shorthand for decoding your STDIN)
[16:53:41] <ZZzz> Thank you! That worked!
[17:01:35] <ZZzz> is u in /gu needed in this case or is it optional?

[17:11:29] <haj> If you use "use 5.012" (or any higher version), then /u is the default behavior, so I guess its relevance is shrinking

[17:23:35] <xenu> he meant that it enables /u
[17:23:51] <xenu> as an alternative to 'use 5.012'
[17:30:58] <haj> It only is relevant for codepoints between 128 and 255.  TIAS:

[17:31:57] <xenu> sure, but no one disputed that

[17:38:55] <ZZzz> (escapted the ' in regex)
[17:39:54] <haj> If your code contains UTF-8 characters, you need to tell Perl that:

[17:49:45] <ZZzz> either this "s/\\"/״/g;s/'/׳/g"
[17:50:16] <haj> Also, for the \' thingy: you just can't escape a single quote in bash

[22:38:14] <djerius> huh.  push returns the number of elements in the list.

[22:39:16] <Grinnz> it does, but most people aren't even aware and i've never seen code rely on it
[22:40:26] <djerius> can't say I've ever seen it either.  'nuff golfing for the day.

[22:57:41] <gordonfish> Yeah real nice. Though I might write that as: (undef, my @interspersed) = map ...

[23:06:48] <mst> I don't find that as pretty, though I could see the argument that it's clearer
[23:10:47] <gordonfish> mst: It's mainly that that undef in that my list looks somewhat odd (even it's perfectly normal to see)
