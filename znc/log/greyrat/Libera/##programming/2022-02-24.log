[02:33:51] <oldlaptop> "shared" or "dynamic" libraries can get copy-pasted at runtime instead, and at least save space on disk - sometimes it can even be arranged for two programs to share the same copy in memory.

[02:37:58] <PlanckWalk> I'm more concerned about security bugfixes.
[02:38:06] <pyzozord> AIUI?
[02:38:06] <PlanckWalk> With a DLL, you fix the library once.
[02:38:11] *** Quits: tracey (~trace@user/trace) (Remote host closed the connection)
[02:38:21] <pyzozord> that's also true
[02:38:24] <oldlaptop> PlanckWalk: That's basically the same space/bandwidth issue as far as something like Debian is concerned.
[02:38:25] <PlanckWalk> With a static library, you have to recompile/redownload every application that uses it.
[02:38:45] <oldlaptop> (That is, your updates are more expensive.)
[02:38:57] <PlanckWalk> That's *a lot worse* than just redownloading the library multiple times.
[02:39:13] <PlanckWalk> Since applications tend to be much bigger than libraries.
[02:39:19] <oldlaptop> Indeed. It would make bandwidth and storage costs on things like linux mirrors balloon.
[02:39:25] <pyzozord> yes it's redundancy vs dep management
[02:39:52] <PlanckWalk> The other side is of course incompatible versioning hell.
[02:40:25] <oldlaptop> Assuming dynamic linking went *poof* overnight, things like apt would probably end up shipping application binaries as "static libraries" too, and linking them at install time.
[02:40:48] <PlanckWalk> Since sometimes, some library author is going to do an update that breaks some software but not others.
[02:40:59] <PlanckWalk> And fixes issues for others
[02:41:20] <PlanckWalk> So you end up having to maintain split versions
[02:41:21] <oldlaptop> (openbsd does something not entirely unlike this - the kernel and (dynamic/shared) C library get relinked at every boot so (in principle) every openbsd system has a "different" one for buffer overrun exploit purposes)
[02:41:41] <PlanckWalk> Which is at least possible with things like LD_PRELOAD
[02:42:08] <pyzozord> what it was all following the go model of very fast compilers

[02:43:13] <pyzozord> actually "what if it"
[02:43:19] <oldlaptop> You're really still using dynamic linking, in a sense, if you do that.
[02:43:42] <pyzozord> not that would be static linking
[02:43:57] <pyzozord> during compilation, just compilation would happen just before runtime
[02:44:02] <oldlaptop> In one sense - but you're also making "compile time" the same thing as "run time".
[02:44:17] <oldlaptop> You're still connecting the application to the libraries at runtime.
[02:44:18] <pyzozord> no no, runtime can execute for 30 minutes and than load

[02:45:19] <pyzozord> i mean it could theoretically, nothing stops them from implementing it like this
[02:45:27] <oldlaptop> "dynamic" libraries aren't dynamic because of things like dlopen(), though - they make things like dlopen() possible, but it's still a sensible distinction if dlopen() doesn't exist.
[02:45:27] <pyzozord> but I think it doesn't do it
[02:45:51] <PlanckWalk> Yes, dlopen is later than most dynamic libraries are loaded

[02:46:33] <oldlaptop> glibc dlopen()s some junk for nss, I believe, but basically all users of glibc (that aren't trying to be completely static binaries, anyway) are oblivious to that

[04:03:32] <CalimeroTeknik> you're good to go if you understand that a compression algorithm "predicts" the rest of the data from what you already have (the idea is reusing data that's repeated)
[04:05:16] <CalimeroTeknik> the compressed data will look like "random" information, not because it makes no sense (it makes sense), but because each next bit of data cannot be predicted even knowing the previous ones: it's "random"

[04:37:27] <sonny> how do you guys conceptualize an OS?
[04:38:05] <sonny> I'm starting to think it's best to just consider it a program that can run other tasks

[04:38:47] <sonny> to build this abstraction, you need a HAL tho
[04:40:10] <flakland> sonny what about DOS and other non-multitasking OS's ?
[04:40:20] <auk> audio, you might be looking for the concept of a "queue"? Or if the async function returns a return value, you could call it from a sync function and capture its retval 
[04:40:43] <flakland> i don't think there is a solid definition of OS, so it's endlessly debated
[04:40:54] <sonny> flakland the simpler OS can do one task at a time, the other can do multiple

[05:02:12] <flakland> my thoghts, it could be better in some situations, or worse.  probably worse unless you can completely eliminate the increasingly-slower syscall context switch

[13:20:54] <ski> (in some cases, a compound value might be stored in multiple registers (possibly virtual). in that case, you simply replace the contents of the register)
[13:21:09] <ski> yes, that's why i said "virtual"
[13:21:25] <ProfSimm> Well I don't get what you mean. I'll use an example

[13:22:22] <ejjfunky> krad: talk about cassandra, how different is it compare to other sql language?
[13:22:53] <krad> ejjfunky: it looks like query comparing columns aren't supported in CQL
[13:23:13] <ski> ProfSimm : that's (probably) a store (an indirect memory store via `x', using offset `y')

[13:25:27] <ProfSimm> ski: sorry wrong nick
[13:25:29] <ProfSimm> pyzozord: in SSA you don't mutate, but it has to represent mutations as well
[13:25:54] <ski> you load a register with the immediate constant `10'. you have an address in a register corresponding to `x'. you add an offset corresponding to `y' to that address, putting that in a register. you do an indirect memory store, through this register, using the other register (with the constant)

[13:32:55] <ejjfunky> from what i see, the select is by value. what you could try is to do a subquery to the same table
[13:33:19] <ejjfunky> like a join query

[18:18:17] <scream> but adhd isn't well-described, either. there are testimonials from scores of women who were prescribed it for strictly performance enhancing reasons who struggled with addiction as a result, despite again never being offered therapies

[19:20:33] <absentia> you should always be asking these anyway, so it's nice to be prompted i guess
[19:21:00] <absentia> and the "why" is most important - if another team comes up to us and just drops a PR into our inbox with no explanation, we'd be like "what the fuck is this"

[23:57:48] <ProfSimm> It's kinda amazing we figure out a way to stuff hundreds of thousands of characters in a format compatible with ASCII
[23:58:26] <ProfSimm> If you ASCII me, one byte is all we need for text. I won't apologize for the pun

[23:58:57] <ProfSimm> In fact I need about 64 chars

[23:59:09] <ProfSimm> I don't need lowercase letters, or control characters.
[23:59:17] <gog> i only need lowercase letters
[23:59:33] <ProfSimm> gog: it's OK the font can render them however you wish
[23:59:34] <beaky> yes the idea is in ascii you only use 7 bits but you can use the 8th bit as a prefix code to indicate how many more bits you need
[23:59:37] <gog> true
