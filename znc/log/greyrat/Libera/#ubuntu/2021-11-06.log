[01:11:25] <ztane> how do I force a certain version of pkg to be installed from ppa, looking at the apt-cache policy x for example, I can see that it has default version number of 0.8.10~develop-2021-10-12-5911fdf6-0ubuntu1~focal and then when I try to install x with apt install "x=0.8.10~develop-2021-10-12-5911fdf6-0ubuntu1~focal" I get "version not found"

I am aware that when changing drivers it is possible for sever problems to occur (such as losing the display entirely). If that should happen I wanted to be prepared (armed)
[02:08:51] <blahboybaz> with the correct sequence of events (and commands) to return to the xorg driver - even if that meant entering recovery mode to do so. Additionally, while chatting just now, I attempted to switch to the proprietary driver throught the Additional Drivers window (graphically). I was presented with a window to enter a password to be used for secure boot. I am not comfortable doing such a thing because (1)
[02:08:57] <blahboybaz> I don't know what result that will cause and I don't want to have to enter an additional password when I boot OR I do not want to have to remember a password to make change in bios in the future if I have to. AND (2) I though secure boot was disable in my bios settings anyway. Finally, I tried to return to the xorg driver at that point (without entering a secure boot password nor completing the
[02:09:03] <blahboybaz> process). It won't let me swtich back to the xorg driver now because it says something about a lock and unable to access something something. I just want to go back to the xorg driver and put an end to this nightmare so I can enjoy my computer again. I don't care anymore if it screws up when I resume from hibernation sometimes. I just want to be stop having to deal with this but I have to at least put

[02:56:13] <five623468263> Hey everyone. I am facing a very odd issue with chroot. I prepare Ubuntu Raspberry Pi images (arm64) on my Ubuntu 21.04 amd64 host via chroot and qemu. It has always worked great, but since I updated my host to 21.10, inside the chroot, I can't invoke any command with arguments. For example, trying to mv goes like this:
[02:56:13] <five623468263> root@ubuntu:/# mv etc/resolv.conf etc/resolv.conf.bak
[02:56:13] <five623468263> mv: missing destination file operand after 'etc/resolv.conf.bak'
[02:56:13] <five623468263> Try 'mv --help' for more information.
[02:56:13] <five623468263> Trying to nano resolv.conf just opens a blank editor.
[02:56:13] <five623468263> This issue exists for absolutely every command arguments. Does anybody have any idea? Thanks

[02:57:41] <five623468263> It's literally the most bizarre issue I've ever seen
[02:57:50] <M0rydon> hello
[02:58:08] <sarnold> five623468263: the usual convention when execution programs on unix is for the argv array to include the command name as the very first argument; so when you exec mv, it looks like: execve(mv, [mv, foo, bar, 0]);
[02:58:23] <sarnold> five623468263: so it feels a lot like whatever shell you're executing has forgotten this convention entirely :)
[02:58:36] <five623468263> my host shell is bash, and so is my chroot
[02:58:53] <jhutchins> five623468263: resolve.conf is in /etc
[02:58:58] <five623468263> the exact same chroot works wonders with Ubuntu 20.04 and before on the host... just not since 21.10
[02:59:15] <five623468263> I am in / when I execute that command
[02:59:38] <jhutchins> five623468263: Hm, no, that's not it if you're in /.

[03:00:15] <five623468263> The issue is that the shell fails to parse my commands, and I have never seen that happen before
[03:00:26] <five623468263> Could it be something to do with locales?
[03:00:56] <sarnold> probably not
[03:00:56] <rfm> five623468263, the only thing I can think of that causes that is getting $IFS set to something odd
[03:01:18] <sarnold> I suggest trying dash or tcsh or zsh or ksh or something and see if it's common to all the shells or if it's specific to the one shell
[03:02:01] <five623468263> Another strange issue is that whenever I run `chroot /mnt/chroot`, nothing happens until I Ctrl+C, then the chroot shell starts working
[03:02:10] <five623468263> I don't know if this means anything
[03:03:19] <five623468263> I just tried with plain old `/bin/sh` and the same behavior exists there
[03:03:36] <rfm> five623468263, that also sounds like there's something odd in the chroot profiles (like /etc/profile, or one of the per-user ones)
[03:04:09] <five623468263> Also, the craziest part, I can "work around the bug by doing this:
[03:04:19] <five623468263> cp SOME_UNUSED_WORD resolv.conf resolv.conf.bak
[03:04:45] <sarnold> cp cp resolv.conf resolv.conf.bak would be much more reliable
[03:05:13] <five623468263> Yeah, I was just visualizing the idea... but this is either way not a solution
[03:05:26] <sarnold> maybe it's less common these days but once upon a time it was commong for one executable to be used for multiple 'programs' and it would decide what to do by looking at argv[0]

[10:49:15] <tomreyn> i think so, but it's been a long time since i used aptitude, so I might remember incorrectly
[10:49:19] <tomreyn> !aptitude
[10:49:19] <ubottu> Like apt and apt-get, aptitude is a terminal frontend for Ubuntu's package management system. Unlike the others, it is not recommended in Ubuntu because its behavior differs significantly from other Ubuntu package management tools and can cause issues.

[12:13:24] <Fatal_Sushi> since i never have done that i'll leave that to someone else
[12:13:24] <ThinkT510> you can use gparted to format it and then edit /etc/fstab to mount it automatically
[12:14:25] <ThinkT510> make sure you backup anything you wanted to keep before formatting
[12:14:29] <Rockerul> well...I think I did it in a way, but don't know if it's the correct way, or if there is an "correct" way

[13:39:30] <oerheks> qskwood, why would ubuntu install python 2?
[13:39:45] <qskwood> That would be my exact question.
[13:39:47] <oerheks> you surely should look at the package you install with npm
[13:39:55] <qskwood> I'm not using npm.
[13:40:01] <qskwood> I'm using `apt install npm`
[13:40:24] <oerheks> then it is a dependencie of nopm, likely
[13:40:27] <qskwood> Yes
[13:40:29] <qskwood> Yes it is

[15:52:04] <TJ-> now, before you think this is over, one reason that may have been renamed is to allow another module to load and operate that device.

[15:52:40] <TJ-> if you find the device is flakely or doesn't perform as expected, then you may need to install a different package "apt install r8168-dkms" instead

[18:18:18] <Sven_vB> sometimes you can also use the non-encrypted version by changing the URL to http:// . GPG signatures should be safe enough for content validation; the only attack I know of would be for a MitM to make you believe an update is not available yet.
[18:19:15] <TJ-> Firefishe: "sudo dpkg-reconfigure -p high apt-cacher-ng"

[22:06:01] <tmp1> is there any trick that I am missing  ?
[22:06:20] <cbreak> grub can't boot off of encrypted zfs
[22:06:29] <tomreyn> tmp1: there's only one ubuntu distribution, with multiple flavors. there are also ubuntu derivative distributions.
[22:06:31] <tmp1> for now I can only make one of the distros bootable
[22:06:40] <cbreak> normally there's an unencrypted /boot, and an encrypted /

[22:09:20] <tmp1> tomreyn: yes
[22:09:53] <tmp1> but I am not able to make it multiboot. because at the moment of installation grub only see one of the partitions.
[22:10:05] <tomreyn> tmp1: if you really want the installations to be fully isolated from one another, i.e. actually making it impossible that they access one another, you'd need to use virtualization and place them in different networks.
[22:10:25] <cbreak> why different networks?
[22:10:29] <jhutchins> tmp1: The hardware will always access one physical device for boot.  It may offer a menu, but you can't have more than one active boot partition.
[22:10:41] <tmp1> but why cant' I simply use different partitions ?
[22:10:49] <jhutchins> tmp1: You should be able to mount the others and chroot to them, but you're creating your own problems.
[22:10:53] <cbreak> they can't run at the same time, so they can't communicate even if they have the same network
[22:10:56] <tomreyn> you can alternatively install them side by side, encrypted or not, but that will not prevent one installation writing to (overwriting) the other installations storage
[22:11:40] <cbreak> maybe zfsbootmenu can do something
[22:11:44] <cbreak> but it'd be far from automatic

[22:12:13] <tmp1> what I need is 2 installs of ubuntu 20.04 that have two encrypted and separate partitions with different passphrase and when I boot I wanna choose what distro to boot and what / to uncrypt

[22:12:59] <tomreyn> dmcrypt-luks would be the common approach still.
[22:13:20] <cbreak> does that require a separate /boot too?
[22:13:27] <tmp1> just a separate unencrypted /boot that may or may not be the same for the two distos, but separated and encrypted /
[22:14:04] <tomreyn>  /boot may be encrypted with luks1, grub can boot this.
[22:14:18] <tmp1> the problem is that I am not able to install grub in a way it allows to boot both distros
[22:15:02] <tomreyn> tmp1: is this uefi or bios booting?
[22:15:10] <tmp1> uefi
[22:16:05] <tomreyn> so if you don't actually need full isolation then you could either place different copied of grub on the ESP, configured to boot one ubuntu variant...
[22:16:14] <cbreak> I currently use refind to select which boot loader to use. You could maybe do something similar.

[22:17:51] <tomreyn> os-prober would not be able to identify the other installation if that was encrypted, so you'd need to manually manage the other systesm' grub configuration then.
[22:18:05] <tmp1> but since partitions are encrypted , and that I do not mount other's distro partition from the second distro... it only see and configure one single ubuntu in grub
[22:18:31] <tmp1> tomreyn: that seems to be the problem precisely.
[22:18:39] <tmp1> but how to do it manually ?
[22:18:55] <cbreak> if each ubuntu has its own copy of grub, you can chose between the grubs from refind
[22:19:10] <cbreak> (or the uefi firmware boot chooser, which usually sucks)
[22:20:07] <tomreyn> tmp1: copy, or note down, what the grub other installations' grub configuration would be, and set that up on the original installations' grub configuration, i'd say.
[22:20:30] *** Quits: pavlushka (~pavlushka@user/pavlushka) (Remote host closed the connection)
[22:20:53] <tomreyn> tmp1: though with uefi, having multiple copies of grub installed, and their configuration managed by each of the OS installations individually, may actually be easier.
[22:21:42] <cbreak> it's probably easiest if you have separate efi partitions, but I don't think that's needed, you can have different subdirs too probably
[22:21:51] <tomreyn> you'd just need to ensure that their grub shims on the ESP will not overwrite one another, i.e. will be installed to different locations on the ESP

[22:22:15] <cbreak> yeah. Or usb sticks :P

[22:28:18] <cbreak> native ubuntu has entry  HD(1,GPT,101abacd-...,0x800,0x100000)/File(\EFI\UBUNTU\SHIMX64.EFI)
[22:28:48] <cbreak> but you could naturally have an other grub in XUBUNTU, LUBUNTU, UBUNTWO or what ever
[22:29:15] <tmp1> I will try with refind. but for now it's not booting
[22:29:25] <tmp1> is it secureboot compatible ?

[22:29:46] <cbreak> I think it can be made, but I don't use secure boot, so I'm not sure how. I think by default it is not
[22:30:45] <tomreyn> adding another bootloader in front just to have a menu to select other boot loaders from doesn't seem to make much sense to me
[22:31:02] <cbreak> refind isn't a boot loader
[22:31:03] <tomreyn> the uefi already provides that
[22:31:07] <cbreak> it's a boot choser
[22:31:22] <cbreak> one that's much better and much more reliable than the one in UEFI
[22:31:52] <tomreyn> which problem does it solve there?
[22:31:55] <cbreak> refind auto-discovers grubs, clovers, opencores, windows, and a bunch of others
[22:32:10] <tomreyn> in this concrete scenario
[22:32:12] <cbreak> so you don't have to be sure that all the different loaders are correctly registered with efi via efibootmgr
[22:32:27] <cbreak> and if you add / change something, you don't have to make sure the entries are kept up to date all the time
[22:33:07] <cbreak> I use refind for convenience and reliability
[22:33:28] <cbreak> but it isn't neccessary
[22:33:57] <cbreak> if you know how, you can register the different grubs via efibootmgr (and I think ubuntu will do that on its own too normally)
[22:34:57] <tmp1> seems refit is my way
[22:35:00] <tmp1> trying.
[22:35:22] <tomreyn> i see. maybe it's just that i lack experience with refind then. but adding it into the loop seems to increase complexity rather than decreasing it, especially with secureboot.

[22:45:41] <TJ-> tmp1: I don't see any reason why you cannot have several EFI-SP partitions, one per distro install, when using UEFI boot (as long as you ensure each distro does use a different EFI-SP - the installer can sometimes ignore your instructions so you'd need to do that part manually) The UEFI firmware boot entries include the partition index to use to read the boot loader
