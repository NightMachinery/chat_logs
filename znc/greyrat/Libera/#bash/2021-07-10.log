[00:01:15] <justsomeguy> The idea is to use printf -v to assign the value of the old identifier to the new identifier name.
[00:01:44] <twkm> it certainly is wacky.

[00:43:18] <replayer> removing the loop saved like 90% of the time; similar question but for addition of columns: will a loop reading a file line by line and adding val1 +val2  per line be significantly faster/slower than doing some awk based math like awk '{ print $col1 + $col2 }' file  ?
[00:43:41] <replayer> or are there better ways to do math based on columns
[00:43:57] <replayer> currently looks like both take long

[10:46:47] <rs_> just checking if there are limitations in readline >= 7.0 (bash 5.0.0(1)-release): 07C-x C-e invokes $EDITOR and then you can write multi-line commands easily. However, even after enabling 07cmdhist, 07lithist and adding 07HISTTIMEFORMAT='%F' in my .bashrc, lines that are part of the same temporary file ( after pressing C-x C-e ) are assigned their own entry in .bash_history (1013  2021-07-10
[10:46:49] <rs_> i=0 \n 1014  2021-07-10 for i in {1..2}; do...). Is there some way to preserve all the lines used in the temporary file as a single entry in .bash_history?

[12:10:29] <Razva> uplime: in your example `Hello` and `world` have the same color, right? Because the idea was to have `Hello (white)` | `Dear` (green)` | ` World (white)`
[12:10:49] <Razva> that would be `Hello (white)` | `Dear (green)` | ` World (white)`
[12:11:13] <uplime> yes, you can just move the %s's around though to get the exact coloring you want
[12:11:22] <Razva> white = normal, because reset will result in loss of data, you should know that! :P
[12:11:36] <Razva> ah, ok, got it! let me try
[12:12:53] *** Joins: Raguile (~Raguile@user/raguile)
[12:13:50] <uplime> sure thing
[12:15:43] <Razva> so basically, for my usage, its:
[12:15:43] <Razva> `echo "Migrating VM ${green}$vm${normal} from host ${green}$host${normal}."`
[12:15:43] <Razva> vs
[12:15:43] <Razva> `printf 'Migrating VM %s$vm%s from host %s$host%s\n' "$green" "$normal"`
[12:16:23] <Razva> for me the `echo` variant looks more "organised" than the `printf` variant.
[12:16:34] <Razva> are there any disadvantages of still using `echo`?
[12:17:07] <uplime> you wouldn't stick any of the variables in the printf, they'd all be provided as arguments and positioned in the format string via %s
[12:17:47] <uplime> any arguments to echo is non-standard or undefined, among other things. printf has much saner rules

[15:01:03] <earnestly> Razva: See how it's using bash's %q to "escape" the contents of variable?  If your $rstorage was rstorage='$(rm -rf /*)' then what do you think that ssh command will do?

[15:17:31] <earnestly> Razva: From the point of view of the shell that the ssh command runs, your string is arbitrary.  Imagine it as `eval "string"'.  This is what it's doing, this is well beyond merely quoting variables
[15:18:00] <earnestly> So that if your variable contains any shell code, it will be executed as though it was

[15:24:42] <jaggz> Razva, so, the problem with a lot of this is not just care, but code-maintainance (sp)..  even if you test things, check for ' and stuff, if someone later modifies it or you make some dumb typo.. boom..

[18:37:16] <kurahaupo> phogg:  The automated deployment process basically put all the config into env vars, because that was simpler than a separate step writing into the filesystem. And because updating the kernel was easier than re-tooling the deployment process
[18:39:03] <phogg> I would say that's awful, but I've done too much deployment automation. Makes sense.

However, even after enabling 07cmdhist, 07lithist and adding 07HISTTIMEFORMAT='%F ' in my .bashrc, commands that are part of the same temporary file ( after pressing C-x C-e ) are assigned their own entry in .bash_history (1013  2021-07-10 i=0 \n 1014  2021-07-10 for i in {1..2};

[23:10:28] <rs_> twkm: i mentioned it because it might not be a big deal if you are not aware of other possible behavior, not so much as an attempt to have "feature parity"

[23:14:54] <geirha> they show as yellow here
[23:14:56] <rs_> color codes should be used sparingly, yes.
[23:15:03] *** Joins: calla (~calla@modemcable132.7-177-173.mc.videotron.ca)
[23:15:13] <rs_> yeah, it should be brown/yellow instead of red
[23:15:26] <twkm> i don't see either, as i also had my client strip colors due to the spam.
[23:16:20] <twkm> not everyone uses your palette.

[23:18:21] <uplime> it does indeed, im pretty sure
[23:18:22] <twkm> e.g., my terminal allows my to map the 8 color codes to whatever i like.
[23:18:52] <geirha> ah sure, so at least two layers there

[23:19:44] <rs_> the default values should be the same for most (if not all) irc clients and a change from yellow/brown to red is a pretty drastic change for a color palette

[23:36:36] <geirha> perhaps it translates it to an ansi escape that includes bold
