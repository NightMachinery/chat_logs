[00:02:10] <alh> leitz: Seems goodish to me, but you'll probably want "perlnewmod: ..."
[00:02:19] <alh> And somehow keep it 50chars or so max (though I usually am fine up to at least 72)
[00:02:29] <alh> beyond that you'd want to break it into multiple lines

[00:12:53] <leitz> Also put the indented line after a text paragraph to make it set out more.

[00:13:52] <Grinnz> you'll want to squash your commits into one
[00:14:10] <Grinnz> git rebase -i blead
[00:15:29] <leitz> Grinnz, from blead, or from the working branch?
[00:15:36] <Grinnz> on your branch
[00:18:44] <leitz> So, with three "picks", and they go from top to bottom, use the first one as is since it has the better commit, and then squash the last two?
[00:18:50] <leitz> First time I've done this.
[00:18:55] <leitz> Can you tell?  :)
[00:18:59] *** Joins: brtastic (~Thunderbi@185.24.91.138)
[00:19:59] <Grinnz> it doesn't really matter which one you pick but squash all the others and then fix the commit message to be nice
[00:20:12] <Grinnz> i think you need to pick the latest one to squash into it
[00:20:36] <Grinnz> you can use git commit --amend afterward to change the commit message of the last commit
[00:20:48] <Grinnz> and you have to force push the branch after doing either of those things, since you rewrote its history

[00:36:16] <leitz> The local mods have the same commit message, which I set it to. But the "git push --force" says everything is up to date, even though I just did the rebase.
[00:37:32] <Grinnz> you should just have one commit after blead in your log now
[00:41:26] <leitz> I have 4.  :(
[00:41:45] <Grinnz> then the squash didn't do what you thought
[00:41:52] <leitz> Would it be simpler to start fresh?
[00:42:16] <leitz> Besides the hours of work lost to edit a file. Etched in stone, and all that....

[08:02:30] <simcop2387> if i give that up there's lineage os builds to at least android 11

[08:02:52] <pragma-> Aye, I'm using Lineage myself. RIP CyanogenMod.
[08:03:08] <simcop2387> but then i give up decent sounding voice calls and possibly voice calls altogether in some roaming areas :/  that's not a valid trade off
[08:03:34] <simcop2387> since there's a number of carriers that are dropping old 2g style gsm voice calls that i'd be stuck with then
[08:04:49] <ether> I only have a newish Samsung phone because I worked for Samsung and couldn't find anything else worth buying with my employee discount, and I needed something more recent to run 2FA apps

[08:05:54] <simcop2387> ether: i recently managed to get my 2fa stuff almost all ported to keepassxc, it's nice.  there's a few stupid things that use "Authy" for 2fa that I can't port over since the credentials don't actually live on my device from what I can tell.
[08:05:54] <ether> (or, I guess, I have these things rather than something else, because there was nothing else worth getting)
[08:06:20] <ether> I use Authy + Google Authenticator + Duo + Symantec
[08:06:38] <ether> Authy is nice, for syncing in the cloud
[08:06:55] <ether> but I also duplicate all my creds in Google Authenticator as well for safety
[08:07:12] <simcop2387> twitch and something else uses it forget what.  but now i've got it all backed up in keepassxc but still also setup in google authenticator so i can use my watch too
[08:07:15] <ether> although I do nominally have backup codes hidden away somewhere
[08:07:27] <simcop2387> 2fa on a watch is actually significantly nicer than i expected it to be
[08:07:58] <pragma-> I could never feel comfortable wearing a smart watch. I tried a couple of times and I just felt weirdedout.
[08:08:10] <simcop2387> that reminds me i need to rotate my keepassxc hardware tokens again.  mostly because i can't find the backup of them anymore
[08:08:13] <pragma-> Then again, I don't really like wearing any kind of watch on my wrist.
[08:08:17] <simcop2387> i know i have it i just don't remember where
[08:09:03] <simcop2387> pragma-: i started with the old pebbles and have slowly become less and less impressed with them.  that said i still like having one even if they're not as good in a lot of ways.

[08:10:18] <zgu> you have a V30 too?
[08:10:23] <simcop2387> zgu: yep
[08:11:01] <simcop2387> mine didn't get android 9 by default because i bought the "open market" version that's unlocked from all carriers, so i had to get a hacked up carrier firmware that removed the locking.

[18:55:09] <simcop2387> signatures will make it out but there's been a decent amount of bike shedding keeping them experimental even if they haven't really changed
[18:55:27] <xenu> back when smartmatch was created the concept of experimental warnings didn't exist yet
[18:55:54] <xenu> it was retroactively marked as experimental in 5.18 and it stayed so ever since

[19:01:46] <simcop2387> nature of the problem with it mostly.  it can't be fixed without breaking compatibility with code that's out there.  the other part is that nobody can seem to agree on what "fixed" means either
[19:01:55] <El_Che> leitz: because the feature is not a good fit with Perl's type system (in contrast with Raku, where it originates)

[19:03:27] <alh> It's been long enough
[19:03:56] <leitz> simcop2387, thanks. I tend to code at a very basic level. Both smartmatching and signatures seem useful. 
[19:04:11] <alh> I don't write perl without signatures at this point (unless it's for cpan)
[19:04:12] <leitz> I rarely stray out of the core and standard library, though.
[19:06:25] <simcop2387> leitz: honestly smartmatch can be useful as long as you avoid the specific problems it can cause.  most of it revolves around two things: How does it decide when it's doing numerical or string comparison, and how it deals with objects.  If you can make assurances about those things then you probably won't run into issues with it

[19:07:32] <simcop2387> nirnam: they're basically stable so they're probably fine.  the part that hasn't been stable with them is signatures with subroutine attributes at the same time.  the ordering of things changed due to the perl parser being shit.

[22:13:29] <pragma-> lol
[22:13:31] <mst> dvl: might be worth trying Email::Stuffer as a higher level interface
[22:13:32] <pragma-> nice
[22:13:38] <Grinnz> pragma-: this is why i use Mojo::IRC and not any of the old irc connectors - i can decode_irc and encode_utf8 at the edges and everything in the middle is automatically correct
[22:13:53] <simcop2387> My db needs to store the raw irc messages as blobs not text
[22:13:53] <pragma-> Grinnz: sounds blissful
[22:14:57] <simcop2387> And that ends up making enough of a reason to have a channels table so I ccan set a ddefault encoding on them
[22:15:11] <dvl> mst: I tried "my $BodyEncoded = encode_utf8($Body);" and that does not solve it. Same issue with and without that step
[22:15:11] <Grinnz> dvl: note that Email::Sender is just a sender, not a constructor - you want to use an email constructor that knows how to encode text
[22:15:26] <dvl> With debug on, I see: Net::SMTP::_SSL=GLOB(0x802d2d240)>>> RESTRICTED → auto-accept (unless expressly stated otherwise)
[22:15:56] <Adura> Hmm... VERSION TIME
[22:15:57] <Grinnz> dvl: how are you constructing the email currently?
[22:16:25] <Grinnz> for example, if you're using Email::MIME you would want to make sure to use body_str and not body
[22:16:31] <Adura> Two lines for the price of one!
[22:16:40] <dvl> Grinnz: I'm doing: my $email = Email::Simple->create
[22:16:48] <Grinnz> ah, Email::Simple is too simple for this
[22:17:09] <mst> dvl: you should either be using ::MIME directly, or using Email::Stuffer
[22:17:11] <dvl> mst mentioned Email::Stuffer above.
[22:17:11] <Grinnz> it doesn't understand encoding, it only takes the resulting bytes
[22:17:23] <Grinnz> yes, Stuffer is just a wrapper of Email::MIME + Email::Sender

[22:17:26] <mst> dvl: Email::Simple is kinda an ancient footgun

[22:17:39] <dvl> mst: This code is possibly 20 years go.
[22:17:42] <dvl> *old
[22:18:05] <mst> dvl: Email::Sender is not 20 7ears old, and nor is Email::Stuffer, if you're upgrading it to this century, actually do that :P

[22:18:35] <Grinnz> Email::MIME (and by extension Email::Stuffer) also handles encoding headers properly for you
[22:18:37] <dvl> mst: The code around it is, so I don't know how long it's been using email::sender

[22:50:25] <ehuelsmann[m]> I just saw the Corinne presentation by Ovid from June 9th last night. I liked a lot what i heard. But no method modifiers? That is no around? I had hoped that the ones coming with moose got fixed instead of removed....
[22:50:56] <mst> ehuelsmann[m]: he's trying to start with the bare minimum
[22:52:09] <ehuelsmann[m]> Yes. I think that is the only way, but it sounded like complete removal was partially a desirable goal.
[22:52:21] <mjgardner> Moose and Moo will continue to work if you want it, as far as I know.
[22:52:30] <mst> he and stevan are both convinced that method modifiers are usually an antipattern and want to see what happens without them
[22:52:59] <mjgardner> s/it/them/
[22:53:16] <mst> mjgardner: method modifiers is plural, therefore 'them', not 'it'
[22:53:25] <ehuelsmann[m]> I think that what i saw is that Object::Pad already does 99% of what i need from the object system.
[22:53:45] <ehuelsmann[m]> I agree that method modifiers are a last resort.
[22:54:07] <ehuelsmann[m]> But they are really powerful 
[22:54:29] <mst> right, and Object::Pad doesn't yet
[22:54:55] <mst> so ... we'll see
[22:55:08] <mst> you know I tend to like All The Power
[22:55:13] <mst> but I'm willing to wait and see
[22:55:41] <Grinnz> there is a *lot* that i can only do with method modifiers, and i don't see an alternative so far, but it will be easier to make that case once i've used it a bunch
[22:56:41] <ehuelsmann[m]> What the presentation claimed, but didn't explain is that Object Pad offers more complexity and syntactic sugar than Moo(se), with the speed of Moo. How does it achieve that?
[22:57:00] <mst> it's build out of keywords
[22:57:02] <mst> Moo is pure perl
[22:57:13] <simcop2387> pragma-: mst: vague: I have registered the domain.  https://meat.bot/
[22:57:20] <Grinnz> it lets you work with variables rather than methods internally, which is much faster

[23:03:10] <ehuelsmann[m]> It has a lot of trickery in it, but all just Perl, so readable, with a bit of figuring out.
[23:03:39] <ehuelsmann[m]> Much more than XS ( which is total gibberish to me )
[23:09:34] <ehuelsmann[m]> With all the warnings that came with the presentation, i'd be mad to try and use this in LedgerSMB, but from the code clarity perspective, I'd love to start using it (and maybe from a speed perspective too, as I'm adding script invocations loading a lot of LedgerSMB's classes for one-shot execution... (Although i try to isolate that better)
[23:09:43] <ehuelsmann[m]> So i could use some speed too

[23:16:45] <mst> ehuelsmann[m]: note that Moo deliberately doesn't compile various stuff until you first call ->new on a class, so it's -often- pretty fast even for on-demand-ish situations where you haven't made the loading as on-demand as would be ideal
[23:16:58] <mst> that's what Sub::Defer and Sub::Quote are for
[23:21:23] <mjgardner> So much of our code isn't CPU-bound, it's really not a factor here. We optimize for developer productivity.
[23:22:24] <Grinnz> for long-running processes, that's often the case
[23:24:30] <mst> mjgardner: Moo tries to be such that if you need it in a ascript or a CGI it doesn't -pessimise- things without interfering with the developer experience
