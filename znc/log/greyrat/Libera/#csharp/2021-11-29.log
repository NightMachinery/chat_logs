[02:13:45] <bpmedley> Yes, pretty much.  I'm using it for hashing strings.  I want to partition a bunch of paths into buckets, so I need a way to decently distribute the paths.  This algorithm takes a string and gives an integer.  The integer is consistent across invocations and has good distribution across multiple data sets.  That's from memory, so I hope I'm 1/2 correct..

I've been chasing performance issues for a few hours and all I did is move the file and it's 600% faster.. grr..

[04:46:10] <moose> I have been building this DNS proxy implementation for a few months now and ran into a bug with how it handles a specific record type. It came down to a design issue where I was storing wire data inside of a data type where I should've just been storing the common format in the app and letting the serialize do *all* of the work.
[04:46:29] <bpmedley> Woah, fun stuff

[07:39:16] <moose> Where class A is the base and B : A is there a way for A to define A.Foo and have B *remove* B.Foo? A and B are both record classes.
[07:39:57] <DevJohnC> no
[07:40:05] <moose> I didn't think so.
[07:40:24] <DevJohnC> the reason being, you can use B in places that require A, and A specifies support for Foo
[07:41:38] <moose> Aye, I would imagine it could be done but it would be quite janky. Not sure what you would call the property of a method being accessed directly from its originating type but you could do it that way.
[07:41:55] <moose> Where say A.Foo can only be accessed if the type is precisely an A and not a B even though B : A.
[07:43:02] <DevJohnC> interfaces can -sort of- do that, in that if you implement an interface member explicitly it's not a public member of the type unless it's cast to the interface type
[07:43:51] <moose> Oh! I was unaware explicit implementation did that. I just thought it was a clever way to prevent definition conflicts hah
[07:43:58] <moose> It makes sense, just never thought about it.
[07:44:52] <moose> I just wish I could do something like: B.Foo = delete; ;)
[07:46:37] <moose> Basically my use case is that in my DNS proxy I am handing the pseudo-RR, the OPT type. It reuses the TTL field to store a bit packed result code, version, and DNSSEC support flag.
[07:47:39] <moose> In my parser, I switch on the type and then process each thing individually. I wanted my OptResourceRecord... record class... to not have a TTL since it's erroneous to call it that. Best I have is just duplicating the data to a more sensibly named field and marking it obsolete or something.
[07:48:32] <moose> Unfortunately, OptResourceRecord : ResourceRecord, and then we get the TTL since it's a part of the header for all of the other resource records. It's just an annoying tiny piece.
[08:00:01] <Cecen> I feel like I get annoyed that there's no way to enforce constant values as part of an interface on a monthly basis
[08:03:11] <moose> Cecen: Why doesn't an interface defining a property with a {get; init;} not satisfy this?
[08:04:25] <Cecen> The implementation can return a non-constant value, like new Random().Next()

[08:08:34] <moose> Cecen: You could make an abstract class that requires a protected abstract property to be implemented then make a public property that gets the value via the base class and caches the value upon first read.
[08:08:48] <moose> It would do the same thing, mostly :)
[08:12:02] <moose> I am sure I could do something with reflection where you could decorate the interface with [RuntimeConstant] and add proxy methods for it dynamically.

[13:04:44] <MaNa2k> hope it was good enough
[13:06:43] <MaNa2k> task was about, to register and connect to this currency api. make a program that take 3 inputs, base target currency, and amount. would connect to this currency api, and get latest rates, and calculate to target currency from the input
[13:07:07] <MaNa2k> and another task was to do that same, but get rates from a spesific date
[13:09:11] <MaNa2k> the third task was to make an api of my own that would take inputs (base, target, amount) and basically do the same as first 2 task, connect to external currency api and fetch latest rates or from spesific date, and calucate, and return the new amount
[13:09:21] <MaNa2k> finished all of these
[13:12:57] <BSaboia> MaNa2k, good luck
[13:13:57] <MaNa2k> thanks

[13:52:46] <Tobbi_> A Dictionary is probably not the best idea when I compare part of the key with StartsWith, is it?
[13:52:54] <Tobbi_> What would be the best way for that?
[13:53:22] <MatthiasVance> Tobbi_: What is the use case?
[13:54:09] <Tobbi_> Shit, how do I explain this.
[13:56:32] <Tobbi_> I have an SQL query that returns a table...and I want to query that table efficiently...therefore, I created a dictionary with all the key values: var matchingGGZWerts = objikon.GetContext().T103_GGZWERT.FromSqlRaw(ggzQuery).AsNoTracking().ToDictionary(a => $"{a.ID_GZ}_{a.ID_TEILN}_{a.JAHR}_{a.TYP}_{a.ID}");
[13:56:37] <Tobbi_> Something like this.
[13:57:01] <Tobbi_> Because I want to check whether a certain value already exists.
[13:57:13] <Tobbi_> Problem is, I want a,l values that starts with part of the key.
[13:57:21] <Tobbi_> What I did is moronic, isn't it?
[13:57:37] <canton7> Databases are good at finding whether keys exist. Why not use the database for that?
[13:57:51] <canton7> (Presumably the "part of the key" ends at one of the _'s?)
[13:58:40] <Tobbi_> I thought I could preload the stuff into memory before.
[13:58:44] <Tobbi_> And make it faster.
[13:59:03] <edcba> ToLookup ?
[13:59:10] <Tobbi_> ToLookup sounds interesting.
[13:59:54] <Tobbi_> Thanks!
[14:00:46] <edcba> but yeah be sure you have to cache, it only brings problems and maybe not that much improvements
[14:09:24] <Tobbi_> ToLookup does not materialize an EF query, does it? I have to use ToList() beforehand, no?

[14:31:19] <lz_> the more I think about it, the more I think GPL is weird
[14:31:42] <lz_> I understand how it makes sense to ask ppl to distribute changes they make to a gpl library, but their own stuff? it's weird
[14:32:10] <lz_> it's like you can put whatever you want in a license. "if you use this library in your software you have to chop off your penis"
[14:32:52] <lz_> I wonder if *anyone* has ever switched their own code to GPL just to satisfy this requirement
[14:34:25] <edcba> well if i want to build my house on your terrain you probably want something in return and i can't really do it without your accord
[14:34:46] <edcba> if i'm not happy with your terms i have to use some other place
[14:35:45] <lz_> the "something in return" is possibly unlimited in size with gpl
[14:36:09] <lz_> "all your code needs to be gpl", even if it's 10 terabytes of code
[14:36:18] <lz_> to use 1 line of gpl code
[14:36:41] <lz_> I think it's weird
[14:37:26] <canton7> It's more that authors of GPL's code don't want their code being used by other people for profit, or in a way that the open source community doesn't continue to benefit
[14:37:52] <canton7> I think it's less that authors of GPL code want users to switch to GPL, and more that they don't want it being used by closed-source projects, period
[14:39:08] <lz_> sure but it's "contagious", even to ppl who release their code and don't care about it being used for profit or not
[14:39:45] <canton7> Yeah, that's the point
[14:40:04] <lz_> so they're forcing the license onto ppl who're not making any profit
[14:40:12] <lz_> that's not the point you mentioned
[14:40:28] <viaSanctus> amazing...so renaming a project within a solution folder causes VS to crash
[14:41:11] <lz_> or maybe I misinterpreted the license and you can actually have your own license, I'm not sure
[14:41:41] <lz_> yeah I'm dumb nvm
[14:42:16] <lz_> anyway having your own license along side some gpl code doesn't really matter because of gpl so my point stands
[14:43:03] <canton7> If I was someone who didn't want the code I've spent time writing ending up being used to make money for someone else, how else would I write the license?
[14:43:10] <canton7> (Not that I've ever released GPL'd code, mind you)
[14:43:24] <BSaboia> canton7, I think you are right about the intention of GPL
[14:44:08] <BSaboia> But also, I have seen a lot of "entitlement" there. People _demanding_ source code release for small projects because the owner tried to be nice and GPL'ed it
[14:44:31] <lz_> canton7: ok that makes sense
[14:46:25] <moose> lz_: I dunno if that is really true
[14:46:41] <moose> At work our legal counsel says it's fine if we have dual licensing as long as they get to review our GPL usage
[14:46:53] <canton7> Bear in mind, I think GPL comes from a time where people subscribed to the principle of open software. They wanted to create an ecosystem where software was free (as in both speech and beer), and the incentive to join the club was that you could only make use of it if you were part of it
[14:47:10] <moose> canton7: "Free (as in beer) software" they would say
[14:47:29] <moose> But it's all lies
[14:47:41] <moose> Copyleft shite is destructive
[14:47:57] <moose> I release my open source code under an attribution-only license, the MIT license, the holy grail of things open source.

[14:48:09] <canton7> Yeah, I've never released anything copyleft as I said -- but I can still appreciate the original dream
[14:48:22] <moose> That dream, like most extremes, is damaging
[14:48:26] <lz_> moose: yeah I skip anything that is not gpl. even for things I'm not planning to sell, because "you never know"
[14:48:29] <moose> IMO anyway

[14:48:49] <MaNa2k> and dry
[14:49:06] <moose> canton7: Yes it quickly became more about being powerful and abusing women
[14:49:06] <canton7> BSD, Apache, etc, are also all decent MIT-style licenses with only minor differences

[14:53:18] <lz_> I'm ok with ppl changing their mind
[14:53:21] <moose> For sure.
[14:54:01] <MaNa2k> is this cron correct if i want to run something at 12am every day ? 0 */5 * * * *
[14:54:19] <moose> No, I disagree with the wording of his apology as being genuine.
[14:54:30] <moose> "I discovered that some people had negative reactions to my behavior, which I did not even know about. Tending to be direct and honest with my thoughts, I sometimes made others uncomfortable or even offended them — especially women. This was not a choice: I didn’t understand the problem enough to know which choices there were."
[14:54:34] <MaNa2k> sorry, i meant this one 0 12 * * 5
[14:54:39] <moose> He's excusing his behavior left and right, walking it backward as if he's a victim here too somehow.
[14:55:51] <moose> So here's the thing, there's too much weight against him in what happened. He is a womanizer, he defends people who have sex with trafficked women, so there's a pattern. Not just one thing, but two major newsworthy things.
[14:56:16] <moose> But he's also just a sexist asshole, so boom 3 things
[14:56:29] <JakeSays> woo omicron for the win!
[14:56:55] <moose> Yeah did you see the early stuff on rxiv?
[14:57:04] <JakeSays> whats rxiv
[14:57:17] <moose> Basically github for OG medical research instead of code
[14:57:40] <moose> You can get all kinds of early stuff that hasn't been peer reviewed so there's some sifting, but I download the sequenced DNA samples and preserve them locally
[14:57:50] <moose> I have the original shit that China forced the researchers to delete.
[14:57:59] <moose> The government of China, I should clarify.
[14:58:23] <JakeSays> well that was obvious. who else but the govt would force it?
[14:58:42] <moose> I try to differentiate in a more clear manner when speaking about China's citizens versus the government.
[14:58:56] <moose> Too easy to just give the blanket impression that I am speaking badly about the entire nation.
[14:59:27] <JakeSays> ok well whatever floats your boat
[14:59:29] <moose> I don't know where you live honestly but in the US where I live, there's a lot of "China is bad" going on. Has been, but moreso now.
[14:59:45] <JakeSays> i'm in the us as well
[14:59:54] <moose> Ah ok. So you just don't get it then.
[15:00:19] <JakeSays> no, i get it. i'm just smart enough to apply logic to things that are said about china.
[15:00:36] <moose> I am glad you get it, but I don't think it's an intelligence thing.
[15:01:50] <moose> I think extra clarity is good when most people who talk poorly about China in general terms are probably meaning the people, the nation, the culture, all of it together.
[15:01:57] <irwiss> MaNa2k: there's like a million js cron calculators that can verify schedules

[15:02:18] <JakeSays> cron schedules are fun
[15:02:27] <MaNa2k> azure has an extra param
[15:02:29] <JakeSays> azure has special cron?
[15:02:31] <moose> But anywho, the COVID thing. Omicron is highly divergent is all, so it's a little spooky.
[15:02:35] <lz_> moose: sad thing is, ccp has a huge support among the population even if it's hard to measure precisely
[15:02:48] <moose> lz_: They do, by numbers, but not by percentage.
[15:03:02] <lz_> I doubt that
[15:03:10] <JakeSays> MaNa2k: what's the extra parameter?
[15:03:28] <moose> lz_: There is a difference between apparent support and true support as well, remember.
[15:03:53] <lz_> moose: that's why I said it's hard to measure, but you really seem to downplay how popular it is
[15:04:06] <moose> The government of China is also quite controlling of media and many aspects of the image related to how the international community things their citizens feel
[15:04:14] <moose> thinks*
[15:04:36] <moose> lz_: I am not downplaying it, I think there is such little information that is publicly available from reputable independent sources that we can't say.
[15:04:57] <moose> But all of the Chinese people I have spoken to, who are familiar enough that they openly talk politics with me, have basically said it's a sham view.
[15:05:25] <moose> They say most people will support them in certain company and not in others but that most educated people truly don't whereas the majority of financial elites do.
[15:06:05] <moose> So it's split with power and influence and a strange dynamic between that, just like everything else political in the world.

[15:27:29] <MatthiasVance> Tobbi_: It was totally painless before and after
[15:27:39] <irwiss> MatthiasVance: tbh i normally prefer slightly dimmed lights in the room and dark themes, least stress on my eyes and you can turn brightness slightly down so colors pop out on even half decent monitors
[15:27:46] <Tobbi_> oh okay?
[15:27:52] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: No a laser corrected one of the layers (always 3rd out of 5) and they took out that part that was corrected
[15:28:00] <Tobbi_> small incision == someone sticking a needle into your eye
[15:28:01] <irwiss> and i've almost perfect vision
[15:28:05] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: ah ok
[15:28:21] <JakeSays> i desperately want my lenses replaced. hopefully next year.
[15:28:27] <MatthiasVance> irwiss: I might go that was as well
[15:28:50] <irwiss> Tobbi_: tbh in a lot of cases one needle is better than plopping contacts on the eyes daily, or wearing thick af glasses
[15:29:00] <Tobbi_> true
[15:29:03] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: Ah yeah I can imagine. I wonder what I'll do when my sight gets worse again..
[15:29:19] <irwiss> and that's in the "easy" cases where just optical tricks is enough to fix the eyes
[15:29:24] * JakeSays is saving his pennies
[15:30:29] <moose> MatthiasVance: did you have an easy prescription or was LASIK not an option?
[15:30:34] <moose> Never heard of SMILE
[15:30:45] <moose> or was it something not related to the normal eye things
[15:31:29] <MatthiasVance> It's the least invasive option

[21:18:51] <DevJohnC> oh fun! I got gRPC working in Swift :D
[21:19:07] <MatthiasVance> That was .. swift.
[21:19:20] * MatthiasVance runs on ARMs
[21:19:30] * JakeSays runs on legs
[21:19:32] <MichaelLong> gRPC is my next technology to use in a real project
[21:19:42] <DevJohnC> ngl, working in Swift sometimes makes me envious that .NET doesn't compile to native code and interop with C/C++/ObjC quite so easily
[21:19:43] <MatthiasVance> MichaelLong: Regardless of use case? :D
[21:19:57] <MichaelLong> MatthiasVance, no, use case is already defined
[21:20:02] <MatthiasVance> MichaelLong: Ahh
[21:20:10] <MatthiasVance> MichaelLong: Why RPC?
[21:20:57] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: why rpc in general, or why grpc?
[21:21:14] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: The former
[21:21:32] <Suchiman> DevJohnC: why
[21:21:32] <MichaelLong> MatthiasVance, have a traditional client <-> server environment (whereas the server is on "some" yet to be defined SBC), the server part is controlling various measurement related hardware components via CAN-bus etc.
[21:21:37] <JakeSays> i bet he has procedures he'd like to call remotely
[21:21:55] <JakeSays> ohh can. fun
[21:22:16] <DevJohnC> Suchiman, our product comes with plugins to integrate with Adobe products and other things, which have to be native code - the experience writing most of that in Swift as opposed to C++ is very nice
[21:22:37] <MichaelLong> I'm already doing another CAN-related project right now, but with python... not so fun but that's related to the device I've interfacing to
[21:22:49] <DevJohnC> Suchiman, C# would still be my language of choice but given the native requirement it was a non-starter here
[21:23:07] <JakeSays> i enjoy working with can
[21:23:13] <Suchiman> DevJohnC: well with some luck, Native AOT will be productized in .NET 8, it's going to be worked upon a bit in .NET 7 but prolly not gonna finish
[21:23:32] <JakeSays> Suchiman: wait.. i thought native aot was a done deal
[21:23:38] <MichaelLong> MatthiasVance, the client-dll will be likely written in .NET Framework, the server part in .NET 6 or in rust, not sure yet
[21:24:08] <Suchiman> JakeSays: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/61231
[21:24:10] <JakeSays> MichaelLong: how will you be interacting with CAN from .net?
[21:24:18] <MichaelLong> JakeSays, socketcan
[21:24:43] <MatthiasVance> MichaelLong: Ah, hm. I'm still pondering why people would use gRPC over something else. I haven't really digged into it yet.
[21:25:02] <MichaelLong> MatthiasVance, what else should I use? ASP.NET Core?
[21:25:21] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: grpc has become the defacto rpc framework
[21:25:25] <MichaelLong> WCF is something I know in-and-out but it is not really supported anymore
[21:25:48] <brianonymous> we plugged gprc into a pair of prod apps over here..
[21:26:02] <JakeSays> brianonymous: what'd you think of it?
[21:26:11] <MatthiasVance> MichaelLong: Ah so you're abstracting away everything except "some gRPC implementation:"?
[21:26:23] <MatthiasVance> Whereas you might have used WCF before
[21:26:30] <brianonymous> its seems pretty fast... and at first its hard to adapt to making mods.. but you slip into the pattern
[21:26:52] <JakeSays> yeah. it can also be a monster to configure
[21:26:58] <MichaelLong> MatthiasVance, if I understand you correctly, yes.
[21:27:04] <JakeSays> and its HUGE
[21:27:06] <Nasp> MatthiasVance:  Many like GRPC because it's new and fancy
[21:27:15] <Nasp> And some performance benefits in certain cases
[21:27:25] <MatthiasVance> Performance benefits compared to?
[21:27:28] <Nasp> json
[21:27:37] <DevJohnC> you can use json with grpc
[21:27:39] <brianonymous> plus it adds some cross-app dependencies, which im never a fan of.. but hey, whattya gonna do
[21:27:52] <Nasp> You can transfer json with grpc?
[21:27:56] <Nasp> Does it still give benefits
[21:28:01] <DevJohnC> yes
[21:28:04] <Nasp> Neat
[21:28:08] <DevJohnC> well, depends how you view things
[21:28:12] <Nasp> Never really like GRPC because it has a schema
[21:28:17] <JakeSays> grpc is also great for cross technology rpc
[21:28:22] <DevJohnC> like, I consider distributing my RPC contract in .proto files to be a real benefit

[21:29:14] <JakeSays> Nasp: it's like a trivial thing to do
[21:29:23] <DevJohnC> I prefer things to have schema, having an explicit, well defined interface to program against is a must
[21:29:36] <MatthiasVance> Agreed
[21:29:41] <JakeSays> DevJohnC: definitely
[21:29:41] <brianonymous> locks data containers in place

[21:30:09] <Suchiman> JakeSays: so... as you can see, they had to rename it from CoreRT to NativeAOT to avoid giving the impression that it's a third runtime (which it actually is) but then managed to get past management
[21:30:14] <Nasp> JakeSays:  Syncing proto files between a bunch of projects isn't taht trivial is it?
[21:30:18] <Nasp> Maybe you can pack it in some nuget packages
[21:30:24] <brianonymous> Nasp: we just share protos
[21:30:25] <Suchiman> JakeSays: and the surveys were apparently convincing enough that the effort is warranted
[21:30:31] <brianonymous> build process takes it from there
[21:30:47] <Nasp> I've never seen a nice process for it
[21:30:47] <JakeSays> Nasp: sure it is. it's no less trivial than anything else
[21:30:51] <Nasp> I've been wanting to build one
[21:31:13] <JakeSays> Suchiman: but corert is functional as it is, isn't it?
[21:31:20] <brianonymous> Nasp: i couldnt get it to work right in VS (probably could with more effort), but it popped into rider no issue
[21:31:21] <Suchiman> JakeSays: yeah
[21:31:24] <Nasp> JakeSays: But it requires you to belive in all devs understanding that yo uneed to add at the end of proto files right
[21:31:47] <JakeSays> Nasp: yes, devs must understand how to write proto files.
[21:31:57] <JakeSays> just like anything else
[21:31:57] <Nasp> Yeah and that's why i dont like it
[21:31:59] <brianonymous> there used to be a site that helped with that
[21:32:15] <brianonymous> we used that at first and then ended up hand modding once we understood the flow
[21:32:16] <JakeSays> Nasp: lol ok
[21:32:17] <Nasp> Just make it schema less
[21:32:30] <DevJohnC> we version .protos in a git repo
[21:32:42] <DevJohnC> and then use a submodule to control versioning
[21:32:46] <Nasp> DevJohnC:  Do you have anything that verifies people don't fuck em up?
[21:32:53] <JakeSays> Nasp: there's no such thing as schema-less. you either explicitly manage the schema, or you live in chaos
[21:33:10] <tlf> fuck yeah chaos
[21:33:14] <Suchiman> JakeSays: the biggest deficiencies right now are lack of builtin COM support and lack for C++/CLI support
[21:33:16] <JakeSays> tlf: LOL
[21:33:29] <DevJohnC> Nasp, nothing yet beyond "does the client compile"
[21:33:30] <JakeSays> Suchiman: lol some would consider those benefit
[21:33:31] <Nasp> JakeSays: Well json has a schema, but it doesn't care the ordering in which the fields are sent
[21:33:34] <Nasp> protobuf goes boom
[21:34:04] <JakeSays> Nasp: i have no problem with that. it's not rocket science.
[21:34:08] <Suchiman> JakeSays: which means WPF is impossibru to get started and WinForms also does not like to run due to lack of COM
[21:34:21] <JakeSays> also json is an incredibly inefficient clusterfuck
[21:34:31] <Suchiman> JakeSays: although they're working on a new way of doing COM interop that works in NativeAOT and that makes WinForms work
[21:34:39] <brianonymous> theres only one complaint i would have, and that is the no-null thing
[21:34:43] <tlf> I love doing com interop with the old lady
[21:34:44] <MichaelLong> XML > json
[21:34:45] <JakeSays> Suchiman: well, neither of those run on linux so i dont care. lol
[21:34:47] <brianonymous> i mean, not an impossible hurdle. but geez.
[21:35:07] <Nasp> JakeSays:  I just knoow it will cause more issues where i work
[21:35:11] <Nasp> I'd rather use something like message pack
[21:35:19] <Nasp> We can't even agree on a standard way to serialize json
[21:35:36] <edcba> that's why binary is better :p
[21:35:37] <JakeSays> messagepack is no different than protobuf
[21:35:46] <Suchiman> JakeSays: oh yeah and the third thingy is recursive generics
[21:36:07] <DevJohnC> brianonymous, a lot of people consider "null" to be a mistake and grpc can target more languages easier by not supporting null directly and allowing the oneof pattern to do it's job
[21:36:08] <Nasp> JakeSays:  It is schemaless afaik
[21:36:22] <JakeSays> Nasp: you can also use protobuf w/o .proto files
[21:36:31] <Nasp> And how does that work
[21:36:39] <brianonymous> DevJohnC: yeah, its just the one thing i gotta keep in the back of my brain
[21:36:42] <JakeSays> pretty much exactly how message pack works
[21:36:43] <Nasp> Does it send the schema on each request
[21:36:47] <JakeSays> no
[21:37:04] <JakeSays> you explicitly serialize the data, just like you were using BinaryWriter, etc
[21:37:15] <DevJohnC> brianonymous, I'd agree it's a painpoint though, for good or bad, it generates a bit too much boilerplate code when you need to check if a value was specified for a field
[21:37:22] <Nasp> JakeSays: But then it uses a schema right
[21:37:33] <JakeSays> Nasp: no. no schema.
[21:37:41] <DevJohnC> brianonymous, I'd support the codegenerators for various languages generating code for you to check that stuff
[21:37:52] <brianonymous> DevJohnC: id be cool with that
[21:38:06] <Nasp> JakeSays:  So i can use protobuf with and without .proto files
[21:38:15] <Nasp> But how can i be guaranteed that it works
[21:38:37] <JakeSays> Nasp: lol you basically do the work of  a .proto file by hand
[21:38:47] <JakeSays> which is exactly what you would be doing with message pack
[21:39:26] <Nasp> JakeSays:  So add attributes everywhere?
[21:39:34] <JakeSays> no
[21:40:04] <JakeSays> messagepack isn't attributed
[21:40:21] <Nasp> Aparently it can be
[21:40:22] <gufi_> JakeSays, got the motor mounts coated in bronze, and bolted up on the motor =)
[21:40:24] <JakeSays> well, i think there may be an implementation that uses attributes
[21:40:31] <Nasp> But that was my point, no attributes should mean it doesn't require schema to match
[21:40:38] <tlf> gufi_, what're you making?
[21:40:42] <JakeSays> Nasp: what?
[21:40:43] <Nasp> How does protobuf work without attributes then
[21:40:47] <Nasp> If it requries .proto files normally
[21:40:58] <gufi_> tlf, building my talon
[21:41:15] <DevJohnC> if you used attributes you'd still have a schema, your types
[21:41:17] <JakeSays> Nasp: you write an int, you write a long, you write a string.. you read an int, you read a long, you read a string. you do it manually
[21:41:18] <tlf> gufi_, kit car? or total break down and rebuild?
[21:41:24] <DevJohnC> you can serialize your fields into a proto payload directly
[21:41:33] <JakeSays> ^
[21:41:41] <JakeSays> gufi_: cool!
[21:41:59] <Nasp> JakeSays:  Well i'm none the wiser now like everytime someone mentions grpc
[21:42:01] <JakeSays> gufi_: you're just a powder coating ho now

[21:44:32] <gufi_> https://gufidev.net/2021/11/29/coated-and-bolted/ =D
[21:44:35] <JakeSays> Nasp: also you can use grpc w/o a .proto as well. all a .proto file is is a description for the code that gets generated that does the manual work for you
[21:44:58] <JakeSays> LOL @ gufidev.net
[21:45:00] <Nasp> JakeSays:  Yes but isn't that file needed so it knows position one is int age and so on

[21:45:32] <Suchiman> gufi_: sad that it's not gufi.dev
[21:45:41] <DevJohnC> Nasp, not really, the .proto is just a file that tells a code generator what code to write for you - you could write it all by hand if you so desired
[21:45:50] <JakeSays> Nasp: it's only needed if you don't want to write that code yourself
[21:45:57] <DevJohnC> I mean, that would be dumb, but you can do it
[21:45:58] <gufi_> the .dev domains were expensive when i got this domain, this was close enough =)

[21:59:42] <DevJohnC> Nasp, how you claim to know that when you said you know nothing about gRPC?
[22:00:15] <DevJohnC> as with anything else, you do need to take care about how you write your DTOs
[22:00:19] <Nasp> I dont claim i know about gRPC but i've used protobuf
[22:00:27] <DevJohnC> you can add new fields to an existing proto message type at any type
[22:00:30] <DevJohnC> any time*
[22:00:33] <Nasp> JakeSays:  If i add an extra field or remove it
[22:00:44] <DevJohnC> you can reserve space for fields you might need in the future also
[22:01:03] <DevJohnC> and if you do add fields, or use reserved fields, old deserializers will continue to work
[22:01:11] <Nasp> But i don't have a .proto file
[22:01:21] <DevJohnC> that doesn't matter
[22:01:36] <Nasp> So if i add or remove a new field, protobuf doesn't care?
[22:01:41] <Nasp> Even if i dont have .proto files?
[22:01:42] <DevJohnC> there's no magic in a proto file
[22:02:06] <DevJohnC> I'm unsure about removing fields, specifically

[23:55:59] <brianonymous> my cat has learned that the best way to get my attention is to whap my webcam off my monitor
[23:56:16] <brianonymous> he trained me well
[23:58:42] <blez> mine is pushing the whole monitor
[23:59:31] <brianonymous> he would probably do that too, but these monitors are literally carriage bolted to my desk now :)
[23:59:47] <SKull> mine just sit on my keyboard if they want something
