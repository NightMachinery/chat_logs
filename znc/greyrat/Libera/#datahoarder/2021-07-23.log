[01:59:03] <GWM-Deus> So uh, I've never really had to get a real storage server before, but I need some advice 
[01:59:26] <GWM-Deus> My job is throwing away our old SAN, 100Tb~ of flash, I get to take home as much as I like
[01:59:44] <GWM-Deus> What's my best play for really high density storage servers?
[02:00:17] <sarnold> sweet
[02:00:19] <GWM-Deus> It's a FC SAN and I'm not really interested in the FCSW's and so on, some will be used for a RAID10 iSCSI target for my ESXi hosts
[02:00:44] <GWM-Deus> Currently I just throw a bunch of disks into a old PC chassi and call it a day, but it's time to get real 
[02:06:38] <GWM-Deus> So I'm looking for a drivebay or similar that can take a looooot of disks, any suggestions? 
[02:09:03] <sarnold> supermicro's got a 90 drive chassis.. https://www.supermicro.com/en/products/chassis/4U/946/SC946ED-R2KJBOD lol "system configurations require a minimum of 25% of the available drives be populated with validated Supermicro drives."

[20:58:00] <Dragoon> I see that it requires fiddling with WDIDLE tho
[20:58:04] <Dragoon> well
[20:58:08] <Dragoon> does it last long
[20:59:03] <Dragoon> Can it be on 24/7, etc
[20:59:30] <NiLon> there are generally 3 failure points of any given HDD. 1. it fails in few days as new 2. it fails after 2-3 years 3. it fails after 6+ years
[20:59:50] <NiLon> kind of rolling the dice there, 1 tho can be mitigated with a stress test
[21:00:18] <Dragoon> 1 is fine, cause then it fails in the warranty period
[21:01:34] <NiLon> I don't have much experience on blue drives, but they generally are one of the slowest ones
[21:04:50] <NiLon> personally there would be 0% chance I would pick one for OS use, but you do you
[21:05:11] <Dragoon> you'd go for a Red instead?
[21:05:41] <NiLon> SSD is the only option for active use
[21:05:52] <NiLon> HDD's are really only nowdays good for storage
[21:06:02] <unfinity> ・゜゜・。。・ ​ ゜゜\_​ó< FLAP F​LAP!
[21:06:57] <NiLon> if money is the question then getting some 256G SSD + bigger HDD is also very good option
[21:10:03] <Dragoon> ,bef
[21:10:03] <unfinity> Dragoon you befriended a duck in 241.519 seconds! You have made friends with 3 ducks in #datahoarder.
[21:10:33] <Dragoon> SSD really isn't needed imo
[21:10:39] <Dragoon> I torrent to HDD
[21:10:53] <Dragoon> And then move to ZFS array to have no fragmentation
[21:11:06] <NiLon> if you ONLY do torrents, sure
[21:11:17] <NiLon> but for casual desktop, it's going to be just bad experience no around it
[21:11:30] <Dragoon> It's a server lol
[21:11:41] <NiLon> and that SSD is like 20 dollars or what
[21:11:48] <Dragoon> some supermicro mobo, so boot times are like 5 hours
[21:11:59] <Dragoon> so it's like
[21:12:03] <joepie91> jesus christ it's like youtube is getting slower every day
[21:12:13] <Dragoon> 5 minutes and 30 seconds vs 5 minutes and 3 seconds
[21:12:28] <Dragoon> I actually run my linux on HDD as well
[21:12:35] <Dragoon> some WD RED drive
[21:12:46] <Dragoon> But my windows runs on an NVME SSD
[21:12:46] <NiLon> well I'm not that interested on boot times
[21:12:53] <Dragoon> Samsung 850 EVO or something
[21:13:14] <NiLon> my grub has like 30 second timeout even on desktop
[21:13:24] <Dragoon> but linux is plenty smooth without SSD
[21:13:49] <NiLon> with plenty of ram for file cache it can feel that
[21:15:04] <NiLon> but anyway this is stupid discussion
[21:15:29] <Dragoon> I think I'll go with a WD Red
[21:16:52] <NiLon> eh
[21:17:10] <NiLon> you complain that ssd is expensive and then you go with red
[21:17:17] <Dragoon> I mean
[21:17:26] <Dragoon> 1TB WD Red vs 1TB SSD
[21:17:32] <Dragoon> Is still a big diff
[21:18:09] <Dragoon> wait actually
[21:18:21] <Dragoon> that's only a €20 difference lmao
[21:18:30] <Dragoon> for a SATA SSD that is lol
[21:18:46] <NiLon> yeah red's are not the cheapest

[21:19:04] <Dragoon> oh oops
[21:19:15] <Dragoon> I compared a 2TB Red with an 1TB sata ssd
[21:19:40] <Dragoon> yeah ok now the difference is 40~50 euros

[21:20:43] <NiLon> I see cheapest 1TB SSD's around ~100e and 1TB reds are around ~80e
[21:20:51] <NiLon> could maybe get a deal with both of them
[21:21:08] <Dragoon> wtf where do you get your reds?
[21:21:22] <Dragoon> I can get an 1TB Red for €60
[21:21:38] <NiLon> that was just some local retailer, it doesn't have the cheapest disks
[21:21:52] <Dragoon> and a 2TB for €70~75
[21:22:19] <Dragoon> cheapest samsung 1TB SSD is €90
[21:22:31] <NiLon> including VAT?
[21:22:36] <Dragoon> ye
[21:23:04] <NiLon> yeah well sure, you can look for a deal and save some but that was just some local retailer that isn't always the cheapest
[21:23:36] <Dragoon> This one funnily enough is from a local mediamarkt
[21:23:43] <Dragoon> I could pick it up tomorrow if I wanted to
[21:24:42] <NiLon> my home NAS has 7x 12TB wd reds
[21:25:20] <Dragoon> I'm currently sitting on 4x 10TB Seagate Ironwolfs
[21:26:54] <NiLon> 2 of those are dead space tho
[21:27:45] <Dragoon> right
[21:27:57] <Dragoon> I need a decent case for my server
[21:28:28] <Dragoon> Right now it's a 2U supermicro case with a 4U fan lmao
[21:28:33] <Dragoon> so it's just open
[21:28:50] <Dragoon> I was looking at some chinese 24-bay home server cases
[21:32:36] <NiLon> would love to have real rack but can't withstand the noise and there is no decicated room for isolation
[21:33:23] <Dragoon> I am happy my current case comes with a silent PSU
