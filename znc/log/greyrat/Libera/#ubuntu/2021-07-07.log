[02:52:33] <sarnold> reading every sector of the hard drive can take a while
[02:52:47] <TJ-> Guest63: if the source is in any way damaged, it can take days. ddrescue marks blocks it cannot read initially and goes back and forth around them trying to extract the sectors either side. Every read error fault can takes a few seconds to recover from
[02:53:07] <sarnold> a healthy hard drive can do roughly 100MB/s when doing 'large' reads, and ddrescue may not be doing large reads if it expects some / many of the blocks to be broken

[02:58:41] <Guest63> can i do that when the partition is corrupted though?

[02:59:52] <TJ-> Guest63: partitions don't get corrupted, file systems do
