[01:58:10] <johncs> Activ8: no, in fact the situation isn't great. The behavior is not disable-able from outside of SortableJS
[01:58:34] <johncs> Unless we do something particularly drastic and weird, like add our own document click handler and then call stopimmediatepropagation to stop their handler from firing
[01:59:49] <Activ8> flotwig don't use it, it's not activily developed now.
[02:00:17] <Activ8> johncs you develop notepad++ as well? WUT?
[02:00:39] <Activ8> that app rocks, it's what I use to edit code
[02:00:44] <Activ8> not that I'm any good
[02:01:39] <flotwig> Activ8: gotcha, that was my concern. It sounds like I'd have to build from source to get notifications... at this point I should just use thelounge PWA
[02:02:00] <Activ8> what you could do is stick ZNC infront of the lounge chat, that way with android you will get notifications
[02:02:14] <flotwig> ah yea i forgot znc had push notifications
[02:02:27] <Activ8> I don't use it as I'm on IOS but I don't require push anyway
[02:02:47] <Activ8> I actually would hate push to be fair but everyone to their own.  ZNC would be a solution at least without using an app
[02:02:58] <flotwig> i'm not too popular on IRC so np for me
[02:03:06] <flotwig> apparently the web push notifications from thelounge should just work on Android
[02:06:38] <Activ8> https://thelounge.chat/docs/usage#native-app
[02:06:45] <Activ8> "Push notifications are supported on all platforms except for iOS, due to Apple not supporting web push specification and all browsers being reskins of Safari."
[02:07:26] <flotwig> i've always been thinking that PWAs suck compared to a native app but this one is pretty nice. thelounge is changing up my perceptions
[02:08:13] <Activ8> I love PWAs

[02:31:10] <Activ8> you reboot the entire computer? 😄 lots to learn.
[02:31:34] <Activ8> you see bookworm this is when paid support comes in handy with some sort of remote support. 
[02:31:35] <c|oneman> well I would have to learn the command to start it up. I assume its different depending how I installed it
[02:31:44] <Activ8> it's one command c|oneman
[02:32:11] <c|oneman> well u got lucky
[02:32:14] <flotwig> i love it c|oneman don't ever learn, don't let them change you
[02:32:21] <c|oneman> I digured it was sysctl -uydifuguidf --fds-f -fds -
[02:32:29] <c|oneman> thats what it usually is with linux
[02:32:36] <Activ8> lol
[02:33:20] <c|oneman> it also doesnt say how to 'restart' only how to 'start'
[02:33:58] <Activ8> change the word start - with "restart" or "stop"
[02:34:00] <Activ8> usually
[02:34:00] <bookworm> hm... let's see. If the start command is called start, but I really want to restart... what verb would I pick... hm...
[02:34:26] <c|oneman> [ERROR] Unknown command. See --help for a list of available commands.
[02:34:46] <bookworm> Activ8: on systemd restart != stop && start, at least not necessarily
[02:35:08] <c|oneman> I have to type "start stop" ?
[02:35:08] <Activ8> what is you using c|oneman
[02:35:19] <c|oneman> did you borrow that from windows?
[02:35:41] <Activ8> wouldn't that be "stop start"
[02:35:45] <c|oneman> see now im running it with the wrong user
[02:35:47] <Activ8> you could do that I suppose lol
[02:36:36] <c|oneman> thelounge stop and thelounge restart are invalid
[02:36:58] <Activ8> depends how you installed it
[02:37:24] <c|oneman> ah!
[02:37:34] <c|oneman> [19:01:35] <c|oneman> well I would have to learn the command to start it up. I assume its different depending how I installed it

[03:09:37] <johncs> I do not know of a workaround for this issue outside of changing the dependency. We can use a patched version of SortableJS (ex: `"sortablejs": "git+https://github.com/itsjohncs/Sortable.git"` in package.json).
[03:09:47] <johncs> We can sniff Android Chrome and disable dragging for it.
[03:10:10] <johncs> We can let the PR sit until a release is rolled for SortableJS with the new patch (if they accept it).

[03:18:06] <johncs> Ah sure, so to spell that one out, it'd probably be: merge the PR as is (Android users will continue to have their clicks eaten annoyingly), bring in the new SortableJS once they release it

[03:25:51] <bookworm> Activ8: doc changes looks good to me
[03:25:57] <bookworm> (not that I have any say in it)
[03:26:32] <Activ8> you could brunnre8 noted - so edits have been made for the better.
[03:28:31] <Activ8> it just means people can find plugins now, we need the people who made them just to tag the plugins correctly.
[03:35:31] <Activ8> I may write a guide to get the lounge working on windows.  I have already done an automatic installer.  This might open a new window to people who want to host it on a windows box.
[03:36:05] <Activ8> I would like to get involved in the windows side.  I am sure people would like to host it on a windows server who don't have linux experience.
[03:40:22] <bookworm> Sure, why not. Although I think most people don't have a windows server lying around
[03:44:31] <Activ8> You might be supprised, I feel linux might put some people off installing it.  It also doesn't have to be a windows server it could be any kind of windows i.e windows 8, 10, 11 e.t.c. I will open a issue tracker under documentation to discuss further on GH.  Maybe others might like to input. 
[03:47:06] <bookworm> The installation from source or yarn already applies, what's missing is the windows specific stuff like how to shove it into autostart and stuff
[03:49:48] *** Joins: Haxxa (~Haxxa@122.199.46.64)
[03:49:59] <bookworm> you plan to bundle node and yarn in an installer yes? That means you take up responsibility to track upstream for security issues and do an update if things go sideways
[03:50:08] <Activ8> That's an easy fix.  I wrote 2 batch files already to start the lounge in public or private mode.  I feel a new page guide on how to install it from start to finish on a windows box may benefit some who don't want to touch linux.  I didn't even know what yarn or nodejs was before I used this.
[03:50:58] <Activ8> I mainly did it as proof as concept to make sure it's working.  Yarn has a latest.msi and I can pull it from web if I need to but nodejs doesn't.  That comes in revision installers unfortionatly. 
[03:51:14] <Activ8> I did test online installers.  I got the installer file to 26mb.
[03:51:50] <Activ8> something for me to ponder over
[03:53:47] <Activ8> also, it doesn't have to be an exe file.  I could simply provide the batch script for the end user who would update it with versions.  That way I would only need to maintain the batch file script to get it fully working.
[03:54:03] <Activ8> the exe runs the batch on extraction anyway.
[03:54:47] <bookworm> that's objectively worse than a proper application shortcut
[03:55:36] <Activ8> I have to compile the application then
[03:55:43] <bookworm> you want it in the start menu, be able to dock in the taskbar with a sane icon and have the data in %appdir% or whatever it's called
[03:56:00] <bookworm> else you are no better than simply using yarn global install
[03:57:20] <Activ8> no, this would just be for the server side which allows other systems to connect to it, so running it just from a batch file would start the server/service.  
[03:57:35] <Activ8> yeh you could do the yarn global install.  What I don't see in docs is anything about windows
[03:57:51] <Activ8> I didn't even know you could install yarn or nodejs on windows till i bumped across something else somewhere away from here
[03:57:53] <bookworm> there's nothing special about windows ;P

[04:01:15] <Activ8> it even doesn't have to be an automatic installer really it could litterally be a windows full guide from start to finish.

[13:03:49] <fnutt> You cannot merge your fork with The Lounge master.
[13:04:00] <fnutt> It has to go through pull requests.

[13:14:18] <Activ8> oh fnutt yes I could do that. Is that the right way to do it or wrong way though? or does it not matter?  I have no code on there that I would want to keep since its been merged with master now.
[13:14:36] <Activ8> bare with me trying to learn the terminology
[13:14:39] <fnutt> The right way? Who can decide what is the right way?
[13:14:47] <Activ8> good point, alright ill do that
[13:15:02] <fnutt> For me it's the easiest way, instead of having to deal with conflicts between two versions of a file.
[13:15:29] <Activ8> yeh I understand that's fine wanted to double check before I click things
[13:15:49] <fnutt> I'm sure a significant amount of people in this channel disagree though. ;p and will tell you it's a stupid way of doing it.
[13:15:55] <fnutt> But, hey! It works. It's easy.
[13:15:59] <fnutt> and it's quick.
[13:16:05] <Activ8> well it's done now so can't revert that change lol
[13:17:45] <johncs> haha certainly extreme
[13:17:56] <johncs> do you want to know slightly less extreme ways to do that activ8?
[13:18:06] <Activ8> yes please
[13:18:15] <johncs> how are you interacting with your repo?
[13:18:18] <fnutt> You mean ways that invovles multiple commands and dealing with conflicts? ;p
[13:18:19] <johncs> still the git command line?
[13:18:26] <johncs> you don't have to deal with conflicts if you don't want
[13:18:54] <Activ8> nope I was on the website to do that, wasn't on my main machine with git on
[13:19:16] <fnutt> I think I won't tell you how I update my The Lounge instance. hahaha. It will give you nightmares.
[13:20:04] <johncs> i'm quite a lot less opinionated than b-ookworm on these things honestly. the world is messy, it's chill
[13:20:26] <johncs> Activ8 you can't do much through GitHub's website in terms of actually changing the repo
[13:20:52] <johncs> I think updating your fork to match upstream isn't something you can do through the web interface
[13:21:16] <johncs> Or at least, I've never done it
[13:21:44] <fnutt> http://hastebin.com/ilusafetag is my way of installing, updating, adding pull requests and starting The Lounge manually.
[13:22:24] <Activ8> you can't update your master with the changes that you pushed? through the web interface - really? 
[13:22:49] <Activ8> like I mean get it in line with the forked repo you code changed, that's a bit odd lol
[13:22:52] <johncs> Yes, GitHub's web interface is not meant to be a code editor. They have a few code-editor-like features, but it's just for tiny things
[13:22:58] <Activ8> oh I see!
[13:23:31] <johncs> GitHub is mostly just for communication and organizational things.
[13:23:41] <Activ8> next time I do one if you let me know the commands I'll do it via git then moving forward I should be good to go from command line
[13:23:53] <Activ8> I document all the commands I use anyway so I recap later
[13:24:19] <johncs> fnutt: that's pretty tame honestly, you made it sound much worse
[13:24:47] <fnutt> hehe
[13:25:02] <johncs> blowing away a git repo and then re-cloning it is a time honored tradition. git is hard 🤷‍♀️. If you're interested in learning how to interact with git in less extreme ways though, lmk
[13:25:16] <johncs> git reset --hard is pretty great
[13:25:28] <johncs> no merge conflicts with that
[13:25:30] <Activ8> anyway to make things easier.  My aim is to learn through command line anyway
[13:25:36] <fnutt> You'd have to run git reset --hard origin/master
[13:25:49] <Activ8> is it only one command to reset your repo
[13:25:58] <Activ8> cos if it is, I think that would be easier lol
[13:26:12] <johncs> Activ8: it is, though you'll need a one-time setup as well

[13:26:28] <Activ8> I think I already did the one time setup
[13:26:40] <johncs> probably not. your local repo is likely set up to only get changes from your forked repo
[13:26:49] <johncs> so origin/master is probably your fork's master
[13:26:56] <johncs> you need to add the upstream repo as well, so you can refer to that
[13:27:04] <Activ8> oh got ya, well we can look at that the next time I do a PR and it gets merged
[13:27:23] <johncs> I like to rename origin to fork in this case too, cause the name origin just gets kind of confusing
[13:27:29] <Activ8> do you people not document your stuff? lol I used to keep a wiki with all the commands I run

[13:35:39] <Activ8> hold on a second... back to the question I asked before.  Would I not have created a branch for the changes and then just deleted that branch? or is that not how branches work?

[13:38:07] <Activ8> excuse my ignorance, terminology is confusing a little.  If the changes was merged into master would that not mean I could delete the code on my side? since the changes have been made or am I thinking of it the wrong way round.

[13:39:23] <johncs> Activ8: you're right in essence. I'm unclear on the specific thing your asking though.
[13:40:03] <Activ8> the code changes that I made on my forked repo of the lounge.  I'm just looking at branches that's all.  Need to get my head around what a branch is
[13:41:07] <johncs> Yeah you'll essentially end up throwing away the changes you made in the forked repo, because you'll just get a copy of the upstream's repo which now has your change in it.
[13:41:41] <johncs> Playing around with and studying branches is probably a good idea. They're pretty key to a lot of git + GitHub workflows.
[13:42:40] <Activ8> ah got ya
[13:44:04] <Activ8> I have seen in some PRs where people have deleted the branches but the code remained in the master that was merged.  If I come across it again I will get some screenshots but unless that's in regards to something else.  🤷
[13:44:32] <Activ8> unless they are doing it from git or something like that, maybe.  I'll see later about that.
[13:44:48] <johncs> you can delete a branch in GitHub's web ui
[13:45:05] <johncs> but that won't automatically pull in the upstream changes into your fork
[13:45:19] <johncs> so you'd do the first part (getting rid of your changes) without the second (grabbing those changes from upstream)
[13:45:48] <johncs> study up on branches, it'll make more sense afterwards
