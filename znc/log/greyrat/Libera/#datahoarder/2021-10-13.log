[00:00:02] <danderson> I'm actually resyncing my main datasets to a backup NAS right now, after letting them drift out of sync for a while
[00:00:38] <cirdan> My problem is that 100 TB are a lot
[00:01:09] <danderson> yeah, that hurts the wallet no matter how you slice it. Even at 30T it's becoming a struggle
[00:01:45] <cirdan> I need to go through and see what is more important to back up because somethings are in other places
[00:01:53] <danderson> One thing I want to explore for that is archival storage to tape, so I can stop growing my spinning storage and age stuff out to tape for the long term
[00:02:04] *** Joins: forseti (~forseti@2806:104e:1e:787:f5f7:f59b:769b:de6b)
[00:02:12] <cirdan> You really want to keep your tapes as unused as possible just in case
[00:02:14] <danderson> But I need to build a bunch of faith in my tape archival processes first
[00:02:36] <cirdan> Always test the restore because that’s what counts
[00:02:46] <danderson> yup, if I do archival it'll be for data I'll probably never read again, and if I do it'll be read once to pull it back into online storage
[00:03:01] <danderson> (plus periodic reads to check the tapes, ofc)
[00:03:26] <cirdan> I don’t think you need to do a periodic read. Tapes have an archive a life sitting on the shelf for 30 years
[00:03:55] <danderson> Sure, in ideal conditions. I don't know if my house is ideal conditions, so at least while I get started, I'll maybe recheck them once a year or so
[00:04:21] <danderson> that burns one of the precious wear cycles, but I'd rather be sure of how many copies I have before I need to restore
[00:05:00] <danderson> maybe I just lack faith :)
[00:05:38] <cirdan> The real important stuff you need multiple copies of anyway. Like family pictures
[00:05:57] <cirdan> ￼Burn those to 100 GB Blu-ray and back up in other places
[00:06:09] <danderson> oh for sure, the irreplaceable stuff lives in many places. The bulk "annoying to replace" stuff I still want some redundancy, but less.
[00:13:23] <warmwaffles> danderson, I'm in the early stages of lust for tape
[00:13:53] <warmwaffles> blu-ray backup with mdisc seems hokey
[00:14:08] <warmwaffles> on one hand, I get it, on the other hand. wtf.
[00:14:28] <cirdan> From what I understand I am disc is no different from current Blu-ray. None of them or are organic anymore
[00:14:29] <warmwaffles> Like 10 years ago backing up with DVDs was my go to 
[00:14:45] <cirdan> M-disc
[00:14:46] <warmwaffles> errr 07-09
[00:14:59] <danderson> It's probably fine, but for a couple hundred gigs, I'd push to cloud storage instead, the costs will be minimal for that kind of volume
[00:15:26] <danderson> and for high volume, optical just can't keep up with disk or tape :(
[00:15:43] <warmwaffles> right
[00:16:27] *** Quits: macdude22 (~macdude22@2604:2d80:5893:3c00:3d45:5c35:bc9f:385a) (Quit: Textual IRC Client: www.textualapp.com)
[00:17:12] <danderson> (because I have problems, I've also started sketching a DIY tape autoloader, because how hard can it be to build a tape robot, right...)
[00:17:34] <warmwaffles> fires up CAD
[00:17:36] <danderson> Turns out, the motion systems of 3D printers and tape autoloaders are quite similar, a lot of the same tradeoffs and principles apply
[00:18:06] <danderson> Where it gets really hard is if you want to cram it into a rackmount form factor and get the tape densities that HPE/IBM can achieve, because then you have to miniaturize the crap out of everything
[00:18:21] <warmwaffles> or you can pay an intern
[00:18:24] <warmwaffles> :p
[00:18:32] <danderson> yeah but where's the fun in that
[00:18:53] <warmwaffles> "intern, can you fetch me a coffee"
[00:18:59] <warmwaffles> that's the fun
[00:19:21] <danderson> and I have a defective economic brain lobe, so I tend to prefer large capex + no opex over the correct rational decision of "just pay a monthly fee and save money overall"
[00:19:48] <danderson> but I'm not running a business, so I get to do what brings joy, not what is economically correct
[00:20:51] <warmwaffles> So my NAS is currently running on commodity hardware with no ECC, running soft raid 6 with btrfs... monthly scrubs and balances
[00:21:05] <warmwaffles> I'm literally juggling a running chainsaw 
[00:21:32] <danderson> wait, raid6 with btrfs? Or btrfs running on top of LVM raid6?
[00:21:44] <warmwaffles> raid6 btrfs
[00:21:45] <warmwaffles> yes
[00:21:48] <warmwaffles> you read that right
[00:21:50] <danderson> I thought btrfs raid was a "please destroy my data" switch
[00:21:50] <Allie> afternoon
[00:21:52] <danderson> welp
[00:22:05] <warmwaffles> It's been running fine for almost 4 years now
[00:22:16] <danderson> huh.
[00:22:24] <warmwaffles> but this server has also NEVER had an abrubt shutdown
[00:23:14] <warmwaffles> I also have an older synology all my important stuff is copied to, just in case lol
[00:23:18] <danderson> heh
[00:23:35] <warmwaffles> But you can see why I am getting itchy about backups :p
[00:23:52] <danderson> I don't think I'll ever stop using ZFS, unless bcachefs becomes a thing someday and supports tiered SSD+spinning storage. That's the thing that sucks in ZFS, it's just not equipped to handle tiered storage usefully
[00:24:51] <danderson> In theory Ceph is amazing for that too, you can have policies like "keep 1 copy on SSD and an N+M erasure-coded copy on spinning disks"... But unless you're running a datacenter, the overhead of ceph isn't worth it
[00:25:34] <warmwaffles> As much as I want to use ZFS, I refuse to use it on principle because of Oracle
[00:26:30] <danderson> warmwaffles: I have good news for you! OpenZFS has nothing to do with Oracle at all. It was forked by the original ZFS designers when Oracle acquired Sun, and shares zero history with oracle
[00:26:49] <danderson> linux, bsd and illumos all use OpenZFS, the only people using Oracle's ZFS is Oracle
[00:27:01] <warmwaffles> I know, my server is also running archlinux and last I checked there was no openzfs
[00:27:14] <danderson> OpenZFS is actually also more featureful than Oracle ZFS, which I'm sure must annoy Larry endlessly
[00:27:23] <warmwaffles> at least in the official repo
[00:27:29] <danderson> so that's a free bonus for me, anything that annoys Larry must be good for the industry
[00:27:48] <warmwaffles> What I want to do for my next build is a RAID10 system with either bcachefs or btrfs on top 
[00:28:00] <warmwaffles> no fancy software raid 
[00:28:04] <danderson> warmwaffles: hmm, ZFSOnLinux should be in arch... And that's the OpenZFS implementation
[00:28:15] <warmwaffles> https://archlinux.org/packages/?sort=&q=zfs&maintainer=&flagged=
[00:28:17] <danderson> afaik there's no way to get Oracle ZFS without paying Oracle, so there's no risk of accidentally using the wrong one :)

[00:28:48] <warmwaffles> yea
[00:29:00] <danderson> yeah I guess depending on AUR for your primary storage is a bit dicey
[00:29:07] <brimstone> warmwaffles: team "juggling running chainsaw" here too, with a btrfs raid 5, monthly scrubs and balances good for 3+ year so far
[00:29:40] <warmwaffles> brimstone, you ever just grin and go, "Yea this is wrong, but fuck it let's push it"
[00:29:41] <danderson> My NASen run NixOS, and ZFS is mainlined there, just have to enable it as a boot filesystem
[00:30:08] <warmwaffles> I haven't mucked with Nix much. My daily driver is Arch and I know it inside and out pretty well
[00:30:08] <brimstone> warmwaffles: not "push it" per say, but definately a "why not btrfs raid on bare metal?" a few times
[00:30:16] <danderson> I feel like y'all are past-me, still in the "fucking around" stage before the "find out" step :P
[00:30:48] <warmwaffles> the monthly scrubs cause me stress for sure. Lots of I/O on the disks 
[00:31:16] <brimstone> right? i can't have a backup and a scrub running and do anything else
[00:31:46] <brimstone> i just updated my off-system inventory of device name to serial number mapping, you know, just in case
[00:31:52] <warmwaffles> like on my synology when a disk started to fail. I built this nas to copy all the shit over and then just pop a new disk in and reprovision a pool of drives

[17:33:11] <salmon> Hey all
[17:33:41] <salmon> Anyone have a good suggestion for what to use to share a folder with hundreds of gigs of video across the net?
[17:33:50] <Irc2PGuest71530> Why not FTP?
[17:34:04] <salmon> The person I'm in contact with who's trying to share I don't think is super technical
[17:34:23] <cirdan> that depends on what the other person is doing with them
[17:34:36] <cirdan> just copying? have them use winscp and access them that way
[17:34:37] <salmon> I suggested Syncthing or something initially, but I don't want to download the entire share
[17:34:42] *** Joins: Fiji (~Fiji@user/fiji)
[17:34:55] <cirdan> and use scp protocol
[17:34:59] <salmon> Sorry I should have specified - the less-technical person has the files I want
[17:35:08] *** Quits: s0berage (~s0berage@135-23-213-77.cpe.pppoe.ca) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[17:35:25] <salmon> So something that won't need port-forwarding
[17:35:26] *** Joins: s0berage (~s0berage@135-23-213-77.cpe.pppoe.ca)
[17:36:19] <salmon> Like I think Magic Wormhole will get past all the NAT/firewall stuff in the way, but it's CLI only 
[17:37:05] <cirdan> have them install openssh server and https://www.xldevelopment.net/upnpwiz.php
[17:37:42] <cirdan> then you can use winscp :)
[17:37:47] <unfinity> ・゜゜・ ​ 。。・゜゜\_ö<​ Q​UACK!
[17:37:51] <cirdan> ,bef
[17:37:51] <unfinity> cirdan you befriended a duck in 4.614 seconds! You have made friends with 7 ducks in #datahoarder.
[17:38:01] <cirdan> ,ducksnack
[17:38:28] <salmon> Wouldn't he then have to muck around with user accounts and passwords?
[17:38:40] <cirdan> he'd have to add a user for you to use
[17:38:56] <salmon> I'm looking for something that's like "run a GUI app, point it at your folder to share, and then generate a share link"
[17:39:13] <Irc2PGuest71530> BulletFTP is what you're looking for.
[17:39:15] <cirdan> doesn't exist, not for free or local, afaik
[17:39:19] <dfgg_> nextcloud?
[17:40:02] <cirdan> bullet is $85/year
[17:40:25] <cirdan> god i despise subscriptions
[17:40:34] <salmon> I'm already having to convince this guy to share his hoard with me - so the solution should probably be free
[17:40:48] <cirdan> oh yeah you'd be paying for it not him :)
[17:40:50] <salmon> dfgg_: nextcloud is an interesting proposition 
[17:40:56] <salmon> Might be a bit too big though
[17:41:21] <cirdan> i dont think that qualifies as "easy to install"
[17:43:25] <cirdan> salmon: bitvise might work
[17:43:29] <cirdan> it has virtual users
[17:43:33] <cirdan> free for personal
[17:45:13] *** Quits: duds- (~duds-@gateway/tor-sasl/duds) (Remote host closed the connection)
[17:45:15] <cirdan> just curious what is in his horde now...
[17:45:34] *** Quits: Fiji (~Fiji@user/fiji) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[17:45:39] <cirdan> and downloading the entire share *might* be the easiest solution depending on his upload speed
[17:48:04] <cirdan> https://www.bitvise.com/getting-started-open-to-internet
[17:48:08] <cirdan> and it can do upnp as well
[17:48:37] <salmon> I think I'm going to try to walk him through resilio sync
[17:48:39] <cirdan> looks like this is the solution :) i'd install it locally to get used to the settings to change
[17:48:43] <cirdan> ah
[17:49:03] <salmon> That's the closest to meeting all the requirements and I think I can do selective sync
[17:49:14] <cirdan> how much is that?
[17:49:19] <salmon> free 99
[17:50:29] <cirdan> yeah looks like you need home at least to get selective sync
[17:50:35] <cirdan> for $60
[17:50:52] <cirdan> i'd still try bitvise :)
[17:51:48] <cirdan> oh hmm. you sure this is what you want? "Using ‘Selective Sync’ feature, Sync will create placeholder files in your file-system that can be searched locally. Click to download only the files that you need, when you need them, without having to replicate entire folders on every device."
[17:52:48] <cirdan> i guess if you can just do per-folder selective that's not too bad

[18:11:41] <salmon> Yeah or you can do per-file selection
[18:12:00] <salmon> It'll be tedious on my end to go through and check only the files I want, but that's fine with me
[18:12:17] <salmon> You can also go in and change your selection at any time and it will go grab the new files you selected
[18:26:45] <cirdan> i wonder how well that sync sw would work for me
[18:27:12] <cirdan> if it purges docs after a while of not using them it could be pretty nice

[22:22:54] <salmon> What do you guys think is the cheapest option for something I can plug 2 monitors into that will just basically show a youtube livestream video 24/7
[22:24:02] <salmon> Looking at used Optiplex's on craigslist right now. $60 for a Optiplex 3020 seems pretty good but I dunno if the integrated GPU can power 2 1080p monitors
[22:25:32] <sarnold> maybe two chromecasts? those things are really low power and silent
[22:25:33] <unfinity> ・゜゜・。。・ ​ ゜゜\_​o< q​uack!
[22:25:52] <sarnold> ,bef
[22:25:52] <unfinity> sarnold you befriended a duck in 18.818 seconds! You have made friends with 103 ducks in #datahoarder.
[22:27:28] <salmon> sarnold: Yeah maybe, but then I'll need a device to be casting to them all the time, right?
[22:27:34] <salmon> Haven't used them in a long time
[22:30:33] <sarnold> salmon: hmm, good point, yeah, you'll need a phone or something to start the stream when it dies. I dunno what happens if the phone leaves the network :)
[22:31:51] <cirdan> salmon: rpi 4
[22:32:08] <Snuupy> NeoThermic: redacted?
[22:32:10] <cirdan> supports dual 4k
[22:32:38] <salmon> cirdan: Experimented with a Pi, it couldn't even handle a single 1080p stream through VLC
[22:32:45] <salmon> Might have been an older on though
[22:32:47] <cirdan> depends on the codec
[22:33:17] <salmon> I'm looking for a solution that will work for any code
[22:33:21] <salmon> codec*
[22:33:35] <cirdan> any is a large amount
[22:33:44] <cirdan> and you don't need any, you need the ones youtube uses :)
[22:34:05] <salmon> Yes or a standard m3u8 style stream
[22:34:23] <cirdan> that's mp4
[22:34:38] <salmon> MP4 isn't a codec, though, is it?
[22:34:43] <salmon> Just a container
[22:34:45] <imMute> it's a container
[22:35:04] <cirdan> mpeg4 then
[22:35:40] <salmon> Right - or x264
[22:36:16] <salmon> I mean a standard desktop can support virtually any video type. I'm just trying to find at what price point does that stop being true
[22:36:45] <NiLon> rpi4 works as long you have hw acceleration in the player, otherwise it's going to be iffy
[22:36:45] <cirdan> h.264 is part of mpeg4
[22:36:55] <cirdan> https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/play-netflix-raspberry-pi this is interesting
[22:37:55] <cirdan> i wouldn't do it but it's interesting 
[22:38:20] <cirdan> looks like they update wildvine, set the screen to 720p and do a fwe other tweaks
[22:39:02] <salmon> Yeah I'll probably stay away from magic "just make video playback better" scripts unless I can see what it's doing lol
[22:39:16] <salmon> I'll give the Pi another shot tonight and see how well it performs
[22:39:35] *** Quits: Scarecr0w (scarecr0w@user/scarecr0w) (Remote host closed the connection)
[22:39:49] <NiLon> cirdan it's actually commented out for 720p setting
[22:40:15] <cirdan> ah yeah
[22:40:44] <cirdan> not used to reading it in a browser
[22:40:56] <NiLon> but something like smplayer has hw acceleration and youtube playback addon so that might work just fine
[22:41:51] <cirdan> oh now there's an official rpi package for it nice
[22:42:57] <cirdan> wow wtf does spotify use drm. what a waste
[22:44:50] <cirdan> anyway was just a thought since it was small cheap and silent
