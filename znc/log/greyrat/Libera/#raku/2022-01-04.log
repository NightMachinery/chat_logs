[01:07:04] <jdv> idk.  just a lot of intl travel and high density?  i haven't been on mass transit in a while.
[01:08:16] <jdv> and low masking, unlike a tokyo or so.
[01:14:31] <japhb> Wow, I'm surprised that's a problem, given how badly NYC has been hit repeatedly.
[01:15:17] <El_Che> ok, I've the CI to start building rakudo on arm64. Crossed finger we don't hit timeouts
[01:15:56] <MasterDuke> oh nice. what CI has arm64?
[01:17:54] <El_Che> cirrus, circleci and travis
[01:18:42] <MasterDuke> cool
[01:21:15] <El_Che> the exercise is looking at the setups and see which can build +/- 25 packages without hitting a timeout
[01:21:20] <El_Che> even if it takes long

[02:20:59] <[Coke]> 'zef depends Doc::TypeGraph' complains: "Failed to resolve some missing dependencies (use e.g. --exclude="dot" to skip)" - but that doesn't seem to be a valid option to pass.
[02:23:27] <MasterDuke> do you have dot installed?
[02:27:45] <[Coke]> I'm not trying to install it, I'm just trying to list deps.
[02:28:00] <[Coke]> (but yes, I do)
[02:29:26] <MasterDuke> yeah, i just figured if you didn't have it installed a workaround to not being able to exclude it would be installing it, but since you do, that's weird
[02:32:56] <[Coke]> ah, it's the only thing that module depends on, so that's fine. was trying to solve https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/3981
[02:33:07] <[Coke]> (and I think the fix is: we no longer depend on that module)
[02:36:10] <japhb> [Coke]: I've had trouble with the excludes in the past, but I've been using them regularly for a while in my rebuild-everything script.  For example:
[02:36:13] <japhb> App::Mi6         --exclude=curl
[02:36:15] <japhb> Inline::Perl5    --exclude=perl
[02:36:18] <japhb> p6doc            --exclude=dot
[02:36:20] <japhb> DB::Pg           --exclude=pq:ver<5>:from<native>
[02:37:13] <japhb> (The exclude arg has to go *before* the 'install' command, so `zef --exclude=foo install Bar::Baz`
[02:37:38] <[Coke]> japhb: sure. doesn't work with 'depends'
[02:37:44] <japhb> D'oh.
[02:38:47] <thowe> Is this épée project on a public archive somewhere?  Anyone know anything about that?

[19:39:34] <Tirifto> Hello! Would anyone happen to know what ‘return_value + exit_handler case NYI’ might mean? (I guess ‘NYI’ could be ‘Not Yet Implemented’, but then I’m not sure what exactly is lacking implementation.)
[19:39:56] <Tirifto> It’s an error message returned by Rakudo.

[19:47:59] <Tirifto> lizmat: I wrote a simple static site generator in Raku. There, I have a custom subroutine for reporting progress (it only says messages). The program used to work fine, until now I just slightly changed how the subroutine works and added a few calls to it, which gave me this error message. The change involves a dynamic variable and changing its value with ‘temp’.
[19:51:00] <lizmat> Tirifto: without a golf / gist of the program, there's not a lot one can say about that
[19:55:41] <Tirifto> lizmat: Sorry, what do you mean by ‘golf’ and ‘gist’? Raku has ‘gist’, but I guess you’re asking for the source code or some representation thereof? (I should be able to share in a bit.)
[19:56:16] <lizmat> in this context, "golf" refers to a piece of code that can be run to show the problem
[19:56:42] <lizmat> in this context, "gist" means a URL to a place on the Interwebs where that code can be seen / copied
[19:57:06] <lizmat> if you have a Github account, gist.github.com would be the easiest way to make a gist
[20:01:51] <Tirifto> lizmat: I see, thank you for the explanation! So far I have only been able to reproduce the error by running my program (or the tests thereof), but I’ll see if I can isolate it in shorter, single-file code. I don’t use GitHub, but I suppose any plaintext sharing service might work fine?
[20:03:18] <lizmat> yeah, as long as you can paste a URL here :-)
[20:12:59] <Tirifto> Aha! I overlooked a line in my code; now I know more precisely what causes the issue, but it still seems odd, so I’ll be pasting shortly. :-)

[20:29:52] <cono> I was expecting that %h{*} will generate to me similar thing to `* + 2`, whatevercode which I can use in reduce operator
[20:29:55] <Tirifto> lizmat: Welcome to Rakudo™ v2021.12. Implementing the Raku® Programming Language v6.d. Built on MoarVM version 2021.12.
[20:30:02] <lizmat> hmmm...
[20:31:51] <lizmat> Tirifto: are you trying to limit the scope of the change to $*dynamic ?
[20:32:11] <lizmat> if that is so, using 'my' would be better
[20:33:07] <Tirifto> Generally it seems that when I set a temp variable in a block and put a ‘when’ block in there, the ‘when’ block errs.
[20:34:03] <Tirifto> lizmat: That is my goal and using ‘my’ seems to work fine, thank you. :-)
[20:35:01] <lizmat> yeah. maybe we should make using temp on dynvars illegal

[20:39:26] <Tirifto> Well, now I know not to use ‘temp’ with dynamic variables, but I wonder why. What makes ‘my’ a better choice both technically and conceptually?
[20:39:51] <Tirifto> (If there’s a simple answer to that question. :P)
[20:41:13] <El_Che> doesn't dynamic variables break the scope?

[20:52:15] <Tirifto> El_Che: My understanding is that whenever a function looks for the value of a dynamic variable, it should do so in the context of its call. So it does, or maybe rather uses a different one. `o`
[20:52:55] <El_Che> indeed the caller instead of the outer scope
[21:09:57] <lizmat> a dynamic variable is basically a lexical variable that is "visible" from its inner scopes
[21:11:11] <lizmat> m: sub a() { my $*A = 42; b }; sub b() { dd $*A }; a
[21:11:11] <camelia> rakudo-moar 03065e296: OUTPUT: «Int $*A = 42␤»
[21:11:14] <lizmat> m: sub a() { my $*A = 42; b }; sub b() { dd $*A }; b
[21:11:14] <camelia> rakudo-moar 03065e296: OUTPUT: «Failure.new(exception => X::Dynamic::NotFound.new(name => "\$*A"), backtrace => Backtrace.new)␤»
[21:12:03] <lizmat> the "system" dynamic variables also have a fallback in PROCESS::, the outer outer lexical scope
[21:12:52] <lizmat> whenever you look up a dynamic variable, it checks the lexpads of all the frames in the callstack
[21:12:58] <lizmat> and picks the first one it finds
[21:13:22] <lizmat> it gets slightly more complicated with start blocks, but that's the idea
