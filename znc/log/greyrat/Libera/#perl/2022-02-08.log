[01:58:05] <simcop2387> daemon: lol.  i'm fucking with my network again, trying to figure out why there's some weird packet loss after yesterday.  it's only on vlan tagged stuff as far as i can tell.  thought it was because of a mis-autoconfiguration between two switches (one going to 5G and the other to 10G) but taking that out of the loop hasn't helped yet
[01:58:37] <daemon> simcop2387, its a pretty shit idea but I love stringing my low bandwidth net together with openvpn
[01:58:48] <daemon> it does all the packet re-seq and such for you

[02:02:41] <simcop2387> the router can send pings to devices on that vlan all fine, but devices can't send stuff to the router, most of the time.

[02:07:19] <daemon> if they was honest and let you do what you want, I would not care as much
[02:07:45] <buZz> so no telco in the world ever enabled any crypto features on GSM , because that would make it 'too hard' for police to listen in

[02:10:17] <daemon> the gov will always have access to your info
[02:10:20] <buZz> the problem is you dont know if they keep recordings, all -legal- stuff you say today might be -illegal- in a year, they could just dig up old recording of you incriminating future self, boom
[02:10:39] <daemon> the law prevents that
[02:10:47] <buZz> hehe, yeah gl :P

[02:32:38] <daemon> iperf(3) does or tcpdump
[02:32:41] <simcop2387> it's almost certainly a misconfig somewhere here but i don't see it.  likely on the new switch or the router

[19:36:49] <dg_dg> ilmari, i tryed this model, but i miss understand what can be a "value" and a "caption" there. I was thinking value to be a kind of INT and caption to be a STRING...
[19:36:50] <ilmari> *arrays of values*
[19:37:30] <LeoNerd> The values *could* be numbers; they dont' have to be. The widget doesn't care. It's just some value it holds onto to give back to you later if that choice is selected

[19:39:05] <dg_dg> ilmari, what ever the value format is ?
[19:39:12] <LeoNerd> Technically no, the values don't have to be distinct, but if they're not then ->choose_by_value won't work properly. But aside from that it should be fine
[19:39:14] <ilmari> dg_dg: it can be any scalar value

[19:39:51] <LeoNerd> Hrm.. current impl. will; I'm not sure I want to guarantee that
[19:40:00] <LeoNerd> I could note that itself
[19:40:03] <dg_dg> ok. But actualy, did you (someone else reading this) tryed this example script ? 
[19:40:23] <LeoNerd> It runs fine, yes
[19:40:51] <dg_dg> ok well. Then i missunderstand what this Widget is for. I'm surprise by the result.
[19:41:00] <ilmari> dg_dg: having never seen the module before, I just read the docs (and the code for the last bit about choose_by_value vs duplicates
[19:41:04] <LeoNerd> It's a choice; a one-of-N items
[19:41:25] <LeoNerd> The example script doesn't *output* anything. It's just a little interactive demo
[19:41:42] <LeoNerd> If you wanted it to output something you could put a print at the end
[19:42:16] <dg_dg> so... it is not really a demo, but still an example.
[19:42:30] <LeoNerd> It's a "let me see something pretty I can click the mouse on" example
[19:42:50] <LeoNerd> Included at least partly because metacpan doesn't make it very easy to include pictures in the documentation, so I couldn't really show a screenshot
[19:42:59] <LeoNerd> ((yes people have found ways but they're all messy and I dislike them))
[19:43:44] <LeoNerd> I'm not sure what you mean by "not really a demo but still an example"; you seem to be ascribing more of a distinction in meaning between those two words. I use them fairly interchangably
[19:43:59] <dg_dg> LeoNerd, what ever i see on the screen after to run the "demo-example", i can not understand what i'm reading, and what ever i click, it doesn't do nothing. Difficult then to imagine something from there.
[19:44:03] <dg_dg> (for me)
[19:44:10] <LeoNerd> Yes. It does nothing
[19:44:15] <LeoNerd> It is not supposed to *do* anything
[19:44:20] <LeoNerd> It simply lets you play around with clicking buttons
[19:44:24] <LeoNerd> It's a clicky-button toy
[19:44:25] <LeoNerd> Nothing more
[19:44:40] <LeoNerd> What would you like it to do instead?
[19:45:01] <dg_dg> i mean... a demo should demonstrate something. When someone do a demonstration, it should do something, this thing should demonstrate what is it for.
[19:45:10] <dg_dg> that is a great demonstration.
[19:45:20] <dg_dg> An example can be anything concerned by the example.
[19:45:24] <LeoNerd> Yes. It demonstrates what the widget looks like on the screen. It interacts when you click the mouse around it or use keyboard navigation
[19:45:43] <dg_dg> it doesn't interact on my screen actualy.
[19:45:46] <LeoNerd> E.g. you click it and a menu opens, showing you the choices. You click one and now that's the selected one. You can click it again to change your choice
[19:45:47] <LeoNerd> Oh..
[19:45:49] <LeoNerd> Well then it is broken
[19:46:07] <dg_dg> why is it broken on my screen but not on yours ?
[19:46:08] <LeoNerd> It should react to mouse clicks and keyboard presses
[19:46:27] <dg_dg> what should it does ?
[19:46:32] <LeoNerd> 16:15 <LeoNerd> E.g. you click it and a menu opens, showing you the choices. You click one and now that's the selected one. You can click it again to change your choice

[20:02:52] <LeoNerd> E.g. the button demo
[20:03:11] <LeoNerd> The problem you were having with the Choice demo was that mouse wasn't working. So this is the thing to be testing elsewhere
[20:06:08] <dg_dg> hmmm... i think demo-clicker.pl doesn't react as it does, and nothing is happening for demo-clickanddrag.pl
[20:06:20] <LeoNerd> OK sounds like just overall mouse isn't working at all

[20:06:38] <LeoNerd> E.g. in vim
[20:06:39] <dg_dg> but mouse is working for vim and also for tmux...
[20:06:45] <dg_dg> yes
[20:06:52] <LeoNerd> OK, but what terminal?
[20:07:25] <dg_dg> alacritty
[20:07:54] <dg_dg> i'm going to try an other one...
[20:07:59] <LeoNerd> Hrmm.. doesn't appear to be in debian so I can't test it here
[20:08:09] <LeoNerd> Try a basic xterm for a moment and see, and we can come back to alacritty in a moment
[20:08:40] <vague> I'd say alacritty is usually the culprit.
[20:08:54] <LeoNerd> It's possible it doesn't do mouse in the standard way
[20:09:04] <LeoNerd> Which would be a fun discovery as then I'd have more to implement :)

[20:20:42] <dg_dg> Also, i'm using Awesome Window manager.
[20:20:44] <LeoNerd> Righty. Then I'd say mouse input just plain isn't working. That is upsetting
[20:21:04] <LeoNerd> Does mouse work -generally- in that xterm, aside from that? E.g. sitting in a plain shell, can you click-drag to select text?
[20:21:20] <dg_dg> mouse is working in vim, tmux and Curses::UI to...
[20:21:28] <dg_dg> out of the box.

[20:23:38] <dg_dg> inside your application i can not drag on text. Out of it, i can drag anything text, ok.
[20:23:53] <dg_dg> in the shell
[20:24:05] <dg_dg> xterm or alacritty the same.
[20:24:10] <LeoNerd> OK. This is progress
[20:24:48] <LeoNerd> I am beginning to suspect libtermkey is upset about something then
[20:24:51] <LeoNerd> Lets go find its demo
[20:25:29] <dg_dg> LeoNerd, ... i have a good news that can help you to find why... maybe ?
[20:26:00] <dg_dg> it is workjing fine ONLY with kitty terminal
[20:27:17] <LeoNerd> (ok give me a few minutes(
[20:27:38] <dg_dg> not in gnome-terminal bkhl
[20:27:46] <dg_dg> LeoNerd, you are welcome
[20:28:49] <dg_dg> vague, i did loose to much of my time (for nothing) with urxvt already... I decided to stop this necro-storry time.
[20:29:14] <LeoNerd> I'd suggest ignoring all the perl wrapping for now and build just a libtermkey demo, and check that -that- part works. When you run that in mouse mode and click the mouse it should look like:  http://paste.scsys.co.uk/596515
[20:29:14] <Paperbot_> Link title(s): [ magnet_web paste from "LeoNerd" at 217.168.150.38... ]
[20:29:38] <LeoNerd> That'll confirm whether or not even libtermkey is able to see the mouse

[22:14:50] <khosruw> i was looking for an international mobile number library and found Number::Phone::NANP and is really great. its size is about 25mb and it worries me to use it in production.
[22:15:11] <khosruw> is there any lighter library or just use this?
[22:16:55] <lopid> i think there are articles about how it's practically impossible
[22:17:21] <jercos> yeah the major part of Number::Phone::NANP is compiled raw data
[22:18:09] <khosruw> jercos: so you mean it's safe to use?
[22:18:55] <jercos> yes, its actual code is fairly small, Number::Phone just needs to account for the entire world's phone systems :p
