[14:52:53] <d_bot> <Continuation Calculus> for testing purposes, I'm trying to concretize a virtual library's signature, and I can't even get define the type signature I want. `module type TYPE = module type of My_virtual_library with My_param.t = int` doesn't work (type declarations do not match,)
[14:52:54] <d_bot> <Continuation Calculus> It looks like as if `My_param.t` already was concrete, but at the same time, I can't find what its concrete type is

[14:55:43] <d_bot> <Continuation Calculus> Something that might help, how can I ask OCaml what all the constraints it has on a type are?
[14:59:41] <d_bot> <Continuation Calculus> Or even better, given this is only for testing purposes, and not the actual live code, is there an `Obj.magic` at the module type substitution level, where I can be like "no worries, they really are the same type, let me perform the substitution"? I know how to create fake type equality witnesses through GADT and Obj.magic, but not sure how to use this to actually perform the `with type =` that I want
[15:02:22] <d_bot> <octachron> `with` constraints are nearly textual transformation. You cannot have `Obj.magic` at the module level, because it would potentially break the typing of your programs rather than its execution.
[15:03:32] <d_bot> <Continuation Calculus> > because it would potentially break the typing of your program
[15:04:41] <d_bot> <octachron> I would suggest to just check the inferred type of `module type of My_virtual_library` (with `cmi2mli` for instance)
[15:05:59] <d_bot> <octachron> Not really, you can create proofs of false, but your theorems are still well-written theorems (that states non-sensical results).
[15:08:08] <d_bot> <octachron> Or in other words, the typechecker implementation is not written defensively against non-valid module types (or types) and expects well-formed ASTs.
