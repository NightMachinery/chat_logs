[01:32:07] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[01:39:46] <edm> Help me out with a pub debate
[01:40:08] <edm> There’s a video from like 15 yrs ago of a tank missile defense system
[01:40:15] <edm> The system was itself a
[01:40:49] <edm> Missile that popped up before being rotated by a tangential rocket motor to point at the incoming RPG

[01:43:15] <Brekkjern> edm: That is an example of an Active Protection System. The T-55AD Drozd is an example of that, but not quite the same thing you are describing.

[03:20:34] <martian67|> https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FOYoEwtXEAEWJEv?format=jpg&name=900x900 the thought process that went into this is breathtaking
[03:22:11] <martian67|> heres a question though, why are lots of right wing people so like, hyperfocused on weird hypotheticals
[03:22:23] <martian67|> you see it a LOT around guns in particular
[03:22:35] <martian67|> they make up these elaborate extremely specific fantasy scieneros about why you need to have a gun
[03:22:55] <martian67|> and put it forth as some kind of strong arguement
[03:23:09] <martian67|> but its not only guns, like you see this in political debates too
[03:23:22] <martian67|> like we cant have $NICE_THING because of $RIDICULOUS_HYPOTHETICAL
[03:23:46] <martian67|> the whole thing about "death panels" is a great example of this re: healthcare reform in the USA
[03:24:28] <martian67|> and it tends to suck all the oxygen out of the room in discussions, which now become pretty much entirely focused on some hypothetical
[03:24:34] <gwozniak> "If god made a proclamation that guns were the tools of Satan, would that change your views on the 2nd amendment?"
[03:24:46] <skyl4rk> nice
[03:25:20] <martian67|> yeah, the entire idea of a "moral fact machine" is insane lol
[03:25:20] <gwozniak> It turns out there are stupid questions
[03:26:52] <gwozniak> martian67|: I suspect they even phrase it that way because they see the whole notion of morality as made up of universal facts, like physics
[03:28:38] <skyl4rk> hello qanon you old fiend / you posted on the net again / (todo: fill in later) / ...the sound, of stupid
[03:28:45] <gwozniak> heh
[03:29:11] <martian67|> gwozniak:  ive grown so averse to this style of arguement, I pretty much immediately discard anything leaning on hypotheticals too hard
[03:32:38] <skyl4rk> calling it hypotheticals is generous
[03:34:02] <gwozniak> martian67|: that seems like a good heuristic
[03:35:29] <martian67|> skyl4rk: there are examples more ridiculous than others of course

[15:22:18] <epilys> It fell vertically for some minutes, its wings disintegrated and CCTV footage show it falling straight to the ground like a missile. Terrifying

[16:58:54] <gwozniak> That Okta thing looks pretty terrible, but can someone fill me in on what they do?  I glanced at their website and it sounds like a breach there would be really ugly
[16:59:24] <Geekingfrog> It's a single sign on provider.
[16:59:25] <gwozniak> Are they an SSO service?
[16:59:29] <Geekingfrog> exactly that
[16:59:32] <gwozniak> Ah-ha
[16:59:39] <gwozniak> Well... that's terrible
[16:59:41] <Geekingfrog> So a breach there gives you access to *everything*
[17:00:18] <gwozniak> I don't think my employer uses them, but I guess I'm about to find out
[17:00:53] <Geekingfrog> My previous corporate overlord was heavily moving to okta, nearly everything was under it when I left.
[17:01:43] <Geekingfrog> I suppose they're having an interesting day
[17:02:08] <gwozniak> If they have kept this quiet for 2 months, they are in big trouble

Meaning I now had to launch a script every morning after authenticating to renew a bunch of token (artifacts and container image repo) instead of a cron job :/

[18:36:30] <epilys> remember recently when it was on the news his plane had engine issues and was forced to land? Turns out it wasn't his plane, it was a donor's. And he took another donor's plane after that to go home.
[18:36:43] <epilys> He's so rich people just give him handouts /s
[18:37:14] <companion_cube> cracks me up that he's managed to be poorer than if he had just invested his daddy's money
[18:37:51] <epilys> no, he invested it alright
[18:37:53] <epilys> in golf resorts
[18:38:18] <companion_cube> he's probably managed to go bankrupt more than most people
[18:39:18] <epilys> He's very not bankrupt. Everyone was saying so. Right? He's not bankrupt. He is the most stable rich person.
[18:39:40] <companion_cube> his ventures certainly seem to fare poorly

[18:50:11] <epilys> yikes, yeah
[18:50:34] <kronk> put it to you this way, they pacified a western country by planting their own agent of chaos into the executive branch.
[18:53:13] <epilys> In 2015 when putin's opposition leader was assassinated right outside the Kremlin by putin agents, he was working on a report saying why Putin needs the Ukraine war
[18:53:20] <epilys> it's interesting to read a russian perspective on this

[18:54:53] <kronk> that territory will ruin a person.

[18:55:56] <epilys> it has oil doesn't it?
[18:56:00] <epilys> and minerals
[18:56:06] <kronk> doesn't stop it from being a wasteland.
[18:56:51] <epilys> there's a certain kind of beauty in the empty siberia lands
[18:57:02] <kronk> there has to be some reason for russian aggression, and why that region and culture alone hates everything on earth.

[19:00:58] <epilys> yemen was bombed to smithereens by saudi arabia and the media ignored it. hate is global
[19:01:15] <kronk> that's another region of the earth that I'm convinced drives sadism and hatred.
[19:01:25] <kronk> how can something exist in a climate that harsh.
[19:02:04] <kronk> I'm loosely convinced there's a relationship between climate intensity and the behavior of a people.
[19:02:31] <kronk> and that the problems come from intense climates.
[19:02:48] <jmiven> yep... is it particularly hot today at your place?
[19:02:56] <kronk> it's actually quite nice!
[19:03:00] <kronk> spring has sprung.
[19:03:15] <kronk> and note, I don't mean just "hot".
[19:03:15] <jmiven> see? a counter-example!
[19:03:24] <kronk> hah.
[19:04:28] <gwozniak> Inuit of northern Canada might be a counter-example
[19:04:31] <kronk> it's not a particular popular opinion because it's reductionist, but I really do wonder if there's some kind of relationship between climate intensity and "I want to universally destroy everything".
[19:04:44] <kronk> I dunno man, they fuck seals up.
[19:15:10] <kronk> ohohohohoho.
[19:15:41] <kronk> so we have this internal daily survey thing and today's question was "I tell my friends and family that Amazon is a great place to work"
