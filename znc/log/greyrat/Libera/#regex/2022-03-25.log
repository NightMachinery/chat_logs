[06:45:55] <re101-hare-27> hm. still doesn't work right from the code itself but that might just be me implementing the api in a wrong way
[06:46:13] <re101-hare-27> it's pretty straightforward though. is the /gm not needed?

[09:12:46] <re101-squid-5> hi, https://regex101.com/r/4fMEHg/1 that is my regex, i am trying to capture only ether1, but for some reason it keeps on matching until the next non capture group
[09:13:37] <re101-squid-5> any help appreciated
[09:19:48] <digitok> because . matches any char, .*?, although lazy/ungreedy, will match as far as it needs to/can in order to match the rest of the pattern
[09:21:13] <re101-squid-5> ah okay, so how do i make it only capture ether1
[09:21:59] <digitok> https://regex101.com/r/4fMEHg/2
[09:22:31] <digitok> the main issue is that you were not matching the text between the parts you wanted
[09:22:40] <digitok> i.e. between "ether1" and "running"
[09:22:52] <re101-squid-5> oh okay, i thought i was with the non capturing group

[10:44:20] <re101-mayfly-25> any ideas how I can pull out the 1000 Full as just "1000", sometimes the there is no speed in the column
[10:47:54] <Me-me> Well, there are a few approaches, but the basis for all of them is "specificity". May I ask why you have three atomic groups in the middle, one after the other, with the same things in them? They seem like they could be simplified to (?>.{34}) (as opposed to (?>.{13})(?>.{10})(?>.{11}))
[10:50:14] <re101-mayfly-25> 100% right
[10:50:21] <re101-mayfly-25> just evolved that way i guess
[10:50:34] <Me-me> Sure. So here's one approach: https://regex101.com/r/BEiX84/2
[10:55:18] <re101-mayfly-25> so that is great and i can see on match 16 it shows but for all other rows its not there
[10:56:02] <Me-me> Yeah, so the basic principle is that if the group is optional, or in an alternative that doesn't match, then it doesn't match.
[10:56:47] <re101-mayfly-25> right and there for the abscence of the group in my matches indicates the value was not there ???
[10:57:22] <Me-me> Right. Because what happened was, it either matches 11 spaces, or if it can't, it matches the other alternative, which is the alternative that includes the linkSpeed group.
[10:58:04] <Me-me> Like I said, the principle is specificity.
[10:59:00] <re101-mayfly-25> fantastic - thank you so much !
[10:59:09] <Me-me> Happy to help.

[13:48:17] <re101-budgie-73> Java, I need to find a way to find a match where I have a block of text and contains a commented out text with the character
[13:48:50] <re101-budgie-73> with the character "%", it will start and it will end with it, so need to remove the whole block inside.
[14:03:54] <M3r> (\%{1}.+%{1})
[14:04:09] <M3r> (\%{1}.+\%{1})
[14:04:09] <Lindrian> M3r fyi, X{1} == X
[14:04:27] <M3r> yes
[14:04:33] <M3r> its just declarative
[14:05:14] <Lindrian> Maybe a bit too verbose :-)
[14:05:25] <M3r> fine :)
[14:05:35] <M3r> (\%.+\%)
[14:06:04] <M3r> this will capture the block of text inside the % including the % before and after the block
[14:06:24] <Lindrian> Perhaps %[^%]+% would be a better alternative
[14:06:37] <purplex> not bad, m3r
[14:13:37] <M3r> yes Lindrian, or even \%[^\%]+\%
