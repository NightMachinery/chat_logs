[10:40:51] <geirha> the new, inexperienced staff messed up by not reserving the nicks for NickServ and the other services bots, so naturally someone managed to take those nicks and grab passwords
[10:41:12] <geirha> And it seems instead of adminiting the mistake, they just deleted everything ^^
[10:42:00] <yitz> How many people reuse passwords across IRC nets? :D
[10:42:56] <roarde> I only stopped recently. The first case in decades where I was on the right side of close timing. :D

[10:53:44] <geirha> freenode (and now libera) was the only irc network I was on that had authentication
[11:15:18] <chronon_> Wait, what? You say the libera user account passwords have been compromised? Where did you hear that?
[11:18:17] <roarde> no, freenode. so they wiped out all accounts and started over.
[11:18:37] <chronon_> Oh phew! Thanks for the larification.
[11:18:42] <roarde> Libera has the experienced crew, freenode the newbs.

[19:50:18] <BSaboia> I am trying to check some pattern on a file, but it's something rather complex. So it goes like this: if I have a match on Word A, I have to search for Word B until I have an empty line. Otherwise, I have to have some kind of error.
