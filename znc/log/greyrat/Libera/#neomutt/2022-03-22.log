[15:16:12] <flatcap> I've just used `gh` (GitHub cli) to create a pull request.  I'm quite impressed :-)
[15:22:13] <gahr> we're almost back to sending patches via email :)
[15:22:22] <Kinnison> :D
[15:22:46] <flatcap> :-)
[15:22:46] <gahr> now we have this github thingie that everything goes through but nobody looks at because everybody's interacting with it through CLI
[15:22:58] <gahr> isn't it fantastic?
[15:23:20] <flatcap> indeed :-)
[15:24:49] * Kinnison misses the days of mailing lists and code-review in (neo)mutt
[15:25:39] <flatcap> the trouble is, it's a pain
[15:26:22] <flatcap> with git, I push my changes and everyone can look at them in the format they choose, or use them immediately
[15:26:52] <flatcap> with a mailing list, you have to create a patch set, which then wastes the time of dozens of people who have to apply the change set
[15:27:17] <Kinnison> At work we used to use mailing lists, but the covernote had to have a URL to the repo and the branch and SHA from which the patch series was generated
[15:27:28] <flatcap> the linux kernel ml have invented "lore" to do some of the work
[15:27:33] <Kinnison> which permitted easy acquisition for local testing, but also nice easy in-mail-client review
[15:28:01] * Kinnison finds having to use a browser quite unpleasant but appreciates he's unusual

[15:29:37] <Kinnison> the gh cli tool lets you acquire PRs too I think, which is nice
[15:29:57] <flatcap> nice
[15:30:29] <dcpurton> Does anyone use a Gmail account synced to maildir with offlineimap?
[15:31:21] <gahr> well, github or email doesn't make much difference.. it's about the tools you use to interact with them.. at the end of the day they're just a medium
[15:31:41] <gahr> I, for one, do code reviews directly on github's website
[15:32:00] <Kinnison> I mostly end up having to use the website for one reason or another, but I'm trying to use `gh` more 
[15:32:26] * Kinnison would like to see a standard for code reviews being stored into git, to give greater flexibility for tooling
[15:32:39] <Kinnison> Or, for example, being able to share a PR between Github and Gitlab effectively
[15:33:06] <bremner> gahr: well for me using a mail client to write a review versus a browser is a pretty big difference
[15:33:11] <flatcap> hmm... federation?
[15:33:17] <bremner> (I unprefer a browser, but that's just me)
[15:33:17] * Kinnison did some work on a design for that
[15:33:44] <Kinnison> https://www.gitano.org.uk/ideas/git-pull-request/
[15:33:55] <bremner> If I had to use webmail then I guess I'd prefer to review on github
[15:33:56] <Kinnison> it was pretty loose, and I did the design a long time ago and never took it anywhere
[15:34:23] <flatcap> gahr: good point. I *do* use github to write reviews in the right places.  that's very handy

[17:19:11] <gahr> flatcap: I was looking at your PR. So, the index and the pager delegate handling common commands to global_function_dispatcher. Also, after every successful command, an notification NT_GLOBAL_COMMAND is sent
[17:19:56] <gahr> so the index and the pager register and handle that notification, e.g., by recomputing mutt_check_rescore
[17:20:42] <gahr> I imagine in the future you want to use that notification to redraw?

[17:56:47] *** Joins: darkbit (~db@152.32.100.99)
[17:58:18] <gahr> I see
[17:58:33] <gahr> are you planning to pass info about *which* command was executed in NT_GLOBAL_COMMAND?
[17:59:46] <flatcap> that's a bit trickier.  the user could enter anything at the prompt...
[18:00:18] <flatcap> so each command could send a notification allowing a finer-grained update
[18:00:58] <flatcap> we'd probably _still_ need to refresh the screen afterwards
[18:01:06] <gahr> mh
[18:01:25] <flatcap> e.g.   :set var = `my_script.sh`   could mess up the screen
[18:01:31] <gahr> yeah I see
[18:01:41] <gahr> I am trying to understand why you want a notification to begin with
[18:01:53] <gahr> if it just notifies that "some" command was executed
[18:02:02] <gahr> you'd know that because you're in the km_dokey loop
[18:02:17] <gahr> I mean, you just dispatched the op, falled back to sidebar and to global
[18:02:43] <gahr> and that's where you know a command was executed I guess
[18:02:54] <gahr> oh
[18:02:56] <flatcap> not necessarily
[18:03:10] <gahr> you're only using that on an external command!
[18:03:30] <flatcap> I can execute a command from most dialogs, but the index wants to know whether it needs to rescore the emails
[18:04:15] <flatcap> the event loop could be in the index/pager/help/etc
[18:04:26] <flatcap> the *active* event loop
[18:04:37] <gahr> I see
[18:05:16] <flatcap> keep asking questions.  I _think_ it makes sense :-)
[18:05:50] <gahr> ok you don't know where you initiated the <enter-command>
[18:05:58] <flatcap> correct
[18:06:08] <gahr> but you know that you might need to rescore afterwards
[18:06:22] <flatcap> yes
[18:07:14] <gahr> why only after <enter-command> ?
[18:07:48] <flatcap> that's what the code already did
[18:08:06] <flatcap> most functions will already trigger some event: Mailbox, Email, etc
[18:08:42] <flatcap> as they act on some object
[18:10:34] <flatcap> eventually, it might be possible to eliminate that notification, because all of command's actions trigger events anyway
[18:10:40] <gahr> it just sounds weird to me that ":exec next-undeleted" triggers a resort, while <next-undeleted> doesn't :)
[18:11:00] <gahr> *rescore
[18:11:08] <flatcap> yes, it's weird :-)
[18:11:42] <gahr> ok, thanks for the clarification :)
[18:11:44] <gahr> approved!
[18:11:48] <gahr> :D
[18:11:53] <flatcap> thanks
[18:12:40] <gahr> re #3314, are you happy with a single mutt_parse_charset_iconv_hook for both functions?
[18:12:41] <neo-bot> PR by @klartext "mutt_parse_charset_hook() / mutt_parse_iconv_hook() added": https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/pull/3314
[18:13:23] <gahr> how about mutt_parse_charset_hook(), mutt_parse_iconv_hook, and a static internal parse_charset_iconv_hook that the first two call?
[18:14:06] <flatcap> yes.  klartext had two, to start with, but they differed by only the param to mutt_ch_lookup_add()
[18:14:21] <flatcap> so I suggested the merge
[18:16:52] * flatcap thinks ...
[18:18:29] <flatcap> the two outer functions would be essentially empty
[18:19:36] <gahr> yes
[18:19:47] <gahr> but they are API, in a way
[18:20:29] <gahr> and you'd be able to remove MUTT_CHARSET_HOOK and MUTT_ICONV_HOOK
[18:20:58] <gahr> "mutt_parse_charset_hook, NULL" looks way better than "mutt_parse_charset_iconv_hook, MUTT_CHARSET_HOOK"
[18:21:35] <flatcap> true
[18:21:57] <gahr> and the two exposed functions could call the internal one directly with LookupType
[18:22:04] <flatcap> I wasn't planning to separate every command into its own function
[18:23:15] <flatcap> I was hoping to split out the *few* neomutt functions that caused the c functions to be unnecessarily complicated
[18:24:27] <gahr> sure, no need to go all the way in
[18:24:42] <flatcap> let's leave it as one function for now
[18:24:48] <gahr> but the fact that charset and iconv are parsed roughly the same should remain in the implementation, in my opinion
[18:25:59] <flatcap> I'd like to refactor the commands (at some distant point the future)
[18:26:08] <flatcap> the API could be better
[18:26:38] <flatcap> and I'd like to make the lookup table dynamic, so that modules/libraries could register their commands
[18:28:00] <flatcap> yes, I see what you mean
[18:29:20] <flatcap> scratch the dynamic bit.  I've already done that.  I was thinking of functions
[18:29:31] <flatcap> too much stuff to remember
[18:29:45] <gahr> ok I was trying to understand :)
[18:29:48] <gahr> but I couldn't
[18:39:45] <gahr> ok I think we'll have to agree to disagree
[18:40:01] <gahr> I read the comment where you suggested to merge the two functions
[18:40:57] <gahr> and I don't see any downsides in refactoring them into proper do-1-thing functions that hide the details of how they achieve their stuff
[18:41:21] <flatcap> I can see the purity of your vision...
[18:41:39] <flatcap> but currently there are 17 commands (hooks) all parsed by mutt_parse_hook()
[18:42:20] <gahr> look at how mutt_ch_charset_lookup and mutt_ch_iconv_lookup are implemented :)
[18:42:59] <gahr> that would be the logical next step for mutt_ch_lookup_add, too
[18:43:09] <flatcap> hehe, I see

[19:00:52] <gahr> heh I don't think it's a good approach
[19:01:07] <gahr> we have a number of parse_stailq with different target variables
[19:01:09] <gahr> I think that's fine
[19:01:46] <gahr> sorry I might not be aligned with what you want to achieve
[19:02:01] <gahr> I realize parse_hook is a mess
[19:02:16] <gahr> and different hooks are parsed differently
[19:02:36] <gahr> and some of them are parsed almost the same but a bit differently
[19:03:44] <gahr> my point is that I don't see the value of going back midway with mutt_parse_charset_iconv_hook when we were already almost there with the two independent funtions
[19:03:45] <flatcap> no worries
[19:03:56] <gahr> this doesn't imply we need to have a 1-1 mapping between commands and handlers
[19:04:26] <flatcap> ok
