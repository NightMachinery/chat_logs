[20:29:58] <caveman> yes.  draft.  must make a bit neater.  but the idea is there.
[20:32:06] <caveman> the key design goal is to not require trusting the sys admin of the servers.  1st, we don't need servers, 2nd if we opt for a server (to get messages when we're offline), then we must not need to trust its sys admin.
[20:33:52] <caveman> currently, a server admin may silently drop some messages.  this is bad.  i'm thinking of a fix.  e.g. perhaps allow sending messages to multiple relays, all of which send it to the destination without duplication.  this way a single relay can drop messages, but it won't be a big deal.
[20:34:55] <caveman> e.g. if libera gets purchased by another prince, we'll still get our chats normally through the other relays.  
[20:46:19] <danieldg> moderation and group membership are the tricky parts of distributed chat
[20:47:10] <TimMc> ^
[20:47:33] <danieldg> caveman: also, don't use "asym_enc" in notation when you mean "sign" - that's baking RSA assumptions into the protocol

[20:48:50] <TimMc> I've been designing a social media protocol and I am totally not touching "true" group messaging as long as I can avoid it, for exactly those reasons.
[20:49:55] <danieldg> yeah, 1:1 messaging is not too hard - you can basically use email/pgp as the basis, and just fix all the dumb backwards-compat decisions
[20:49:56] <TimMc> If someone wants to design a group protocol, they can hack it up by using a distribution account -- everyone sends messages to one person, that person publishes the messages.
[20:51:34] <danieldg> yeah, having a single entity "own" the group (which is what a distribution account is) is a simple solution
[20:51:35] <TimMc> "Moderation" is choosing who you subscribe to, and maybe trusting your friends as well. And as far as comments on posts are concerned, the post author becomes the moderator.
[20:51:45] <TimMc> Group moderation? Tire fire.
[20:52:31] <TimMc> (Not because of group dynamics, but simply because groups can get huge and unmoderatable.)
