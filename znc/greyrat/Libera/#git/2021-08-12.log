[04:36:05] <bn_work> (tried b, then `git reset HEAD~ <filename>` as before but it didn't stage it back to be omitted)
[04:40:39] <bn_work> I feel doing E is backwards because I have to amend what needs to be edited before the fact?,  I could have sworn in the past at each step of the rebase it would drop to shell with the index set the way was right before the commit and I could modify as needed using normal add/reset commands and then commit it to proceed?

[06:25:34] <Guest67> Hi, I have a workflow question. I'm knee-deep in implementing a new feature on a project -- there are all sorts of tracked and untracked changes. Due to a change in priorities, I need to shelve everything and pick it up much later. What's a good way to save a big bundle of half-baked work? I could create a feature branch and do a crappy commit
[06:25:34] <Guest67> "Lots of changes and half-done work relating to X". And then push that to origin. But then I won't be able to clean up the history later, right?

[06:37:39] <mackerman> Correct, sharing the branch with others means you should not rewrite that history.

[06:41:43] <Guest67> mackerman: Thanks for the input. When the time comes to merge that work in progress branch, is there a way to do it without dragging the ugly history along? (Is that what 'squash' is for?)

[06:48:47] <mackerman> Maybe read a !book and see which of the merge work flows seem reasonble.
[06:48:48] <gitinfo> There are several good books available about git; 'Pro Git' is probably the best: https://git-scm.com/book but also look at !bottomup !cs !gcs !designers !gitt !vcbe and !parable
[06:50:29] <mackerman> Regarding a squash, all the change becomes one diff, which loses the history and could be a large diff.

[11:57:24] <lpapp> hi, is there a way to leave the rebase todo list without rebasing?
[11:57:48] <lpapp> even if I just enter it and leave normally, nothing changes in the content and commit messages, but I still get new hashes. This is not ideal.
[11:58:18] <ikke> make it empty
[11:59:36] *** Joins: christall (~christall@24.235.88.243)
[12:00:15] <lpapp> ok, thanks
[12:00:31] <lpapp> other thing, if I want to edit some line in previous commits and then in a later commit, those lines were moved into a different file
[12:00:38] <lpapp> will git rebase --continue solve that automatically?
[12:00:58] <lpapp> or should I edit the line-moving commit instead? Logically, it does not make sense, but if it is safer...
