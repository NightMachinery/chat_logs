[05:03:30] <plissken> I say [sic] because the Wiki page cuts off in mid-sentence.
[05:04:24] <plissken> Is this still a current issue?  Should I be concerned about buying a ThinkPad P15 ?
[05:05:58] <NetSysFire> first of all, laptop pages tend to be outdated and generally horrible, so take it with a grain of salt
[05:06:20] <NetSysFire> there is the linux-hardware project which may help you here and depending on how old the comment in the wiki is, it may not even applicable anymore

[13:48:49] <ahub> Hey, I would like to use an SD card as an installation medium. I wrote to it using 'cat' as suggested in the wiki. I get to a screen letting me choose if I want the installation with speech or not, but once I select an option, I get the error message 'Error loading \arch\boot\x86_64\vmlinuz-linux: Not Found' and the computer then reboots. I checked the SDCARD, and such a file is present. I a bit at a loss
[13:48:50] <ahub> here, care to help ?

[13:52:32] <ilmostro> backslashes there suggest failure for EFI to locate the kernel, which you may already realize based on your description
[13:55:45] <ilmostro> btw, where in the wiki did you see that?
[13:56:52] <ahub> ilmostro:  https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/USB_flash_installation_medium#Using_basic_command_line_utilities
[13:56:53] <phrik> Title: USB flash installation medium - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
[13:57:37] <ilmostro> yeah, I couldn't find a reference to using sdcard as installation medium anywhere; that's why I'm asking

[14:00:00] <ilmostro> So, that leads me to believe that's not a supported installation medium.  Obviously, USB flash disk is not sdcard.  
[14:00:23] <grawity> if your computer has a direct pci attached sdcard reader - yeah, it's not
[14:00:29] <grawity> for usb ones, should be no difference
[14:00:52] <grawity> however... if the firmware got to the point where it runs the bootloader, etc, then it's weird that it can't load the rest

[14:02:48] <ilmostro> maybe the motherboard firmware supports it but the UEFI in the ISO doesn't?
[14:03:05] <ilmostro> not entirely sure about my logic there, though
[14:04:29] <grawity> there's no such thing as "the UEFI in the ISO", mostly
[14:04:57] <grawity> if it was using GRUB then yeah, it'd be possible since GRUB likes to use direct device access
[14:05:37] <grawity> but AFAIK the iso uses systemd-boot, and it just uses the UEFI-provided file access functions? (it still being the same UEFI firmware from the computer, not something that came with the USB)
[14:06:10] <ilmostro> maybe the second "TIP" should be clarified at https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/USB_flash_installation_medium#Using_basic_command_line_utilities then
[14:06:11] <phrik> Title: USB flash installation medium - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
[14:06:30] <grawity> it might be referring to "UEFI Shell"
[14:06:38] <low-key> has the color option for pacman been deprecated?
[14:06:45] <low-key> i do have it uncommented but there's no color in my pacman output
[14:06:52] <grawity> which is, *kind of* part of UEFI, but really a standalone program

[14:07:55] <ilmostro> whatever the correct flag is (-c or -C); sorry, I'm not on Arch at the moment
[14:08:13] <grawity> low-key: are you running it with the right $TERM (check `tput colors`)
[14:08:25] <low-key> i get 256
[14:08:37] <low-key> i do get color in everything else if that counts
[14:08:49] <low-key> zsh syntax highlighting, nvim, etc.
[14:09:32] <ilmostro> yeah, I did notice that on a recently new system with Arch.  Thought I just got used to it; maybe the default changed?
[14:09:59] <low-key> What is color output even supposed to look like? I ran it with --color always and it looked the same
[14:10:12] <low-key> could one of you share a screenshot?
[14:10:25] <grawity> https://i.imgur.com/vsxCMpV.png having 'Color' in [options] still works just fine
[14:10:36] <Garb0> networkmanager is trash my dudes
[14:10:39] <grawity> note the blue dots and the bold headers
[14:10:40] <ahub> ilmostro:  I agree that this tip is confusing, but that's what I'm trying right now because I'm out of options
[14:10:41] <Garb0> fuck all that shit.
[14:11:09] <low-key> ah, that's quite subtle

[14:12:03] <grawity> some fonts don't have bold, so the renderer has to fake it â€“ which some terminals won't do

[19:13:46] <jaawerth> there ARE iirc services for RH and ubuntu and such that give you pre-cooked live patching for security updates and the like, but these days you'd probably just strive for some level of HA so you can reboot one server without interrupting service (even if you do it using a cold backup and switching over a balancer rather than something "webscale")
[19:14:21] *** Quits: merdely (~merdely@user/merdely) (Client Quit)

[19:15:38] <jkc> Live patching wasn't very helpful, really. In most cases, the new code wouldn't go active until the actual services themselves were restarted, and if you're going to do that... just reboot.

[19:34:03] <jaawerth> but even on debian testing you're living a bit dangerously. also, in my experience using it on my desktops for a few years before arch, its updates are more likely to break things despite the actual package versions being older than arch's
[19:35:00] <jaawerth> though that MAY not be true, just my subjective experience. I always assumed it's just because of how debian/apt packages tend to be more customized from the upstream sources
[19:35:03] <BrainDamage> well, tracking upstream is a valid target, you'll be mostly using the same assumption as the devs

[19:39:17] <dvzrv> alerque: "My instances have been breaking on (it seems) every single freaking upgrade and I have to badge and coax them back online every time" this is rather unspecific. is there logs to look at? is it an issue with any of the apps? I have not had issues with the latest upgrades (although 21.0.0 of course was a milestone in "upgrade nightmares")
[19:39:19] <BrainDamage> arch forks will likely adopt similar base policies to arch, you want to pick a distro that's not rooted in arch
[19:39:27] <jaawerth> I suppose alpine is already kinda close to being that
[19:39:34] <jaawerth> in terms of package format anyway
[19:40:05] <jaawerth> but yeah for actual arch forks it wouldn't make much sense, you'd have to hack your way around things to the point that you mgiht as well have used another distro as your base

[21:32:43] <NeverSummer> You do.
[21:33:01] <chair1> awesome
[21:33:05] <NeverSummer> RAM disks are fairly abstracted by the software you use to create them.  The system just thinks it's a really fast storage medium.
[21:33:07] <Gnuman> I just use tmpfs instead. no formatting necessary
[21:33:37] <chair1> I saw someone saying you could use a RAM disk for /tmp
[21:33:39] <Gnuman> just increase the inode limit if you want to compile something giant like chromium
[21:34:02] <jaawerth> chair1: fwiw, btrfs supports in-place conversion (you'd at least want to take a backup first, but you wouldn't have to do a feull backup + install + reload like you would to apply lvm to a disk) if you wanted to try it before replacing the drive. I haven't done it myself but the wiki talks about it

[22:49:13] <merdely> I haven't seen anyone mention this here (maybe it was mentioned during one of my many X crashed part/joins earlier), but the latest updates to xorg-server and/or xorg-server-common (1.20-12-1) caused crashes
[22:49:19] <merdely> The only other mention I've seen is here: https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=267824
[22:49:20] <phrik> Title: Xorg crashes after today update / Pacman & Package Upgrade Issues / Arch Linux Forums (at bbs.archlinux.org)
[22:49:51] <merdely> For me, I'm using dwm (customized, but also tried with vanilla 6.2) and running Firefox or Qutebrowser would crash X on demand.
[22:50:01] <merdely> I reverted to 1.20-11-1 and all seems fine now.

[23:42:51] <Benzi-Junior> I have a program x that depends on package y, but the current version of y has a bug in it, and in fact every version available on the archive (I'm told it didn't occur in previous versions but it appears those where not packaged for arch) 
[23:43:00] <Benzi-Junior> is there good way to solve this
[23:43:58] <Benzi-Junior> or is  it just get the source files for the old version and copy them over the packaged version
[23:43:59] <baltazar> Benzi-Junior: you can try manually installing int in a virtualenv
