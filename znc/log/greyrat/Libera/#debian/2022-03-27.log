[12:44:15] <rudi_s> CaCode: I don't know tripwire, but regarding gpg: Are the keys still there if you use gpg --list-secret-keys?
[12:44:41] <rudi_s> There are reasons why you use non-packaged software. I can often cause problems but it's not an issue in itself.
[12:44:55] <Khepra> well, in regular debian, there's only one python. actually one python3 branch version and one python2 branch version but 2 is now deprecated. how did you "delete all the older python versions"?
[12:45:27] <Khepra> that said, it's not uncommon to install third party sofware outside of package manager, but you should really minimize those, and never, ever replace system/regularly packaged ones, like python
[12:46:22] <Khepra> btw, tripwire is packaged, and thus regularly installable with normal dependenices

[12:52:31] <rudi_s> CaCode: From what you said it doesn't look like you made any big mistake. You can just reinstall python2 with `apt install python` but the proper solution is to migrate all programs which depend on python2 to python3.

[12:53:27] <Displacer> 11.3 release
[12:53:30] <rudi_s> Displacer: All? That's quite a lot. rsync a debian mirror.
[12:53:58] <Khepra> CaCode: I hope you didn't literally  apt install 'python*'  :)
[12:54:18] <rudi_s> CaCode: Then that should have undone your removal of python2. However, in Bullseye a lot of python2 packages (called python-*) were removed. So they won't be coming back.
[12:54:27] <Khepra> (which by the way, wouldn't even work)
[12:54:29] <rudi_s> Have a look at what actually needs python2 and check if you can migrate it to python3.
[12:54:33] <CaCode> I did I was desperate to get my system up and running again, as i mentioed i am highly intelligent appearantly...
[12:54:38] <Displacer> rudi_s, there should be an official way to download full release for specific arch without rsyncing mirror
[12:54:51] <rudi_s> Displacer: Why? Nobody does that.
[12:54:52] <Khepra> CaCode: I'm sure you didn't because that wouldn't work, it has breakages and doesn't complete.
[12:55:02] <CaCode> oh ok
[12:55:14] <CaCode> ok migrating to python 3

[12:55:21] <Khepra> CaCode: well... didn't you see apt complain about errors and inability to complete?
[12:55:27] <rudi_s> Displacer: There's snapshots.debian.org for old packages.
[12:55:37] <CaCode> I don't remember anymore but I am sure I did
[12:55:55] <Displacer> rudi_s, do you mean there is no way do download full release for specific arch?
[12:56:03] <rudi_s> CaCode: Try `sudo dpkg --audit` to check if everything is in good shape now.
[12:56:05] <Khepra> CaCode: well if you did  apt install 'python*', then that didn't do anything
[12:56:31] <CaCode> thanks rudi_s thank you Khepra
[12:56:47] <rudi_s> Displacer: As I said, you can simply mirror a mirror to get all the .deb files. AFAIK there's no direct way except running `apt-get download` for all the packages you care about.
[12:57:19] <Khepra> well, technically, you can wget from the mirrors directories
[12:57:41] <Khepra> but indeed you should actually create a local mirror or at least apt cacher if that suffices in the use case
[12:58:25] <Displacer> there is jigdo-16G directory in downloads is it full release?
[12:59:12] <Displacer> is there something from https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/ to be consideref full release binaries?

[12:59:37] <rudi_s> Displacer: No, that's just the installer.
[12:59:54] <Khepra> Displacer: https://www.debian.org/mirror/ftpmirror
[13:00:14] <rudi_s> Displacer: Have a look at https://www.debian.org/mirror/size regarding the sizes.
[13:01:11] *** Joins: AMG (ghebo@user/amg)
[13:01:18] <Khepra> ALSO.... don't forget these packages get updates regularly, so one time sync is probably going to become useless in short time
[13:01:33] <rudi_s> (Unless you want it for archival purposes.)
[13:01:43] <Khepra> right
[13:01:59] <Displacer> it is specifically for archival purposes
[13:02:38] <Khepra> well, same warning applies. without updates, your archive is just a specific point in time. how useful is that? I don't know.
[13:03:02] <Khepra> ALSO... I'd talk to debian infra. syncing up hundreds of GB of data is probably somethign they should be informed about
[13:03:42] <rudi_s> Displacer: Well, then rsync the closest mirror as mentioned in the link Khepra posted. You need about 600 GiB storage.
[13:04:00] <rudi_s> *for amd64
[13:04:35] <rudi_s> *I guess less if you only need a specific release like Bullseye

[16:31:39] *** Joins: reillybrogan (~reillybro@2602:ae:1461:da00:7285:c2ff:fedb:5004)
[16:32:07] <Khepra> there is no concept of single "debian" to be "built from source". there's packages, and you can build each one from source. and a collection of packages is a distro, and debian is a collection of various packages
[16:32:37] <Khepra> what makes it "debian" is that the packages are coming from debian source repositories, with all the debian specific custom things applied
[16:33:01] <Khepra> if you're looking to learn how to build a linux distro, then LFS is very much what you need.
[16:33:10] *** Joins: i0e (~is0ke3@user/is0ke3)
[16:34:53] <Khepra> also, I don't know about building custom debian ISOs. but I know debootstrap. I use debootstrap, and if I would need a highly customized installation, I'd debotstrap one, customize it and then use as tarball to seed installations

[16:45:28] <mire> I wanted to have apt package manager and thats how i ended up modifying (unsquash the live filesystem, than chroot into it and modify stuff so that debian live is more customized)
[16:46:17] <mire> I now want to learn about the behinds of apt package manager, how could i build debian distro from source, since adding apt to LFS could easily brick it?
[16:46:41] <mire> also wanted to replace systemd to openrc or runit on that Live filesystem without breaking it as well

[16:47:03] <mire> i heard about devuan, but i wanted to learn how this would work, not to use it as my main OS
[16:47:18] <mire> sorry for a large message, also thanks alot for taking time to answer
[16:48:05] *** Joins: capn (~capn@user/capn)
[16:48:07] <Khepra> on a regular debian installation, you'd start by installing sysvinit-core package, which conflicts with and removes systemd; then you'd see if any other needs removal, and you need to make sure sysv environment is set
[16:48:31] <Khepra> by that I mean inittab settings, any changes to services via /etc/default, and services themselves
[16:48:49] <Khepra> optionally you'd also include elogind to support logind APIs which are needed for desktops and some other things

[16:49:46] <Khepra> sounds simple on paper, but note that it took years for devuan to establish a stable systemd free environment based in debian

[16:50:24] <Khepra> meaning, depending on your needs, it might as simple as installing sysvinit-core, and as complex as doing all kinds of API and config shims, package rebuilds even

[20:38:58] <jmcnaught> You can go back to the mirror selection screen and select a different one.  If you hit escape or cancel out of whatever screen you're on in the installer you can eventually get back to a main menu which lists all the installer steps in order of completion.

[20:49:03] <physkets> Hi!  I need some advice on whether Debian would be an appropriate choice of distro for an install & forget use case.
[20:49:26] <physkets> I need something that can perform automatic updates, and found this:
[20:49:28] <physkets> https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-handbook/sect.regular-upgrades.en.html
[20:49:37] *** Joins: troyt (troyt@2601:681:4101:5911:44dd:acff:fe85:9c8e)
[20:50:06] <Khepra> physkets: the only install & forget is if you don't intend to upgrade/update, and that might work, most of bugs are polished out at release time and definitely now 3 point releases in
[20:50:21] <physkets> This will be installed onto the machine of a highly non-technical user (who is very comfortable using Xfce)
[20:50:39] <Khepra> unattended upgrade exists, and can be configured to restart services on lib upgrades, and reboot on kernel upgrades, but theree's no 100% guarantee it won't actually need attention
[20:51:12] <Khepra> unattended upgrades have a consequence of borking currently running applications in some cases, if that's desktop use
[20:51:12] <physkets> Khepra: well, I would still like it to update. And I will be available for remote support, just not local.
[20:51:28] *** Joins: sh00p (~z@89-253-71-70.customers.ownit.se)
[20:51:46] <Khepra> for example firefox, if it upgrades in the background, will stop working until it's restarted. that may or may not be inconvenient
[20:51:46] <physkets> Ahh; yes, it is desktop use... but very basic; Firefox, LibreOffice, etc
[20:51:57] *** Quits: dvs (~Herbert@2607:f2c0:9566:3f00:d94:1d5:e210:bb69) (Quit: Leaving)
[20:52:02] <physkets> Yes, that would be very inconvenient
[20:52:05] <Khepra> kernel upgrades will require reboots, unless you don't care about patching it for security
[20:52:19] <Khepra> you _could_ time them to occur when the user is not on the computer
[20:52:22] <physkets> this will be a mchine that's shut-down after every use
[20:52:30] <Khepra> (but that assumes a computer that's running at that time)
[20:52:47] *** Quits: berkhan (~berkhan@159.146.40.148) (Quit: Leaving for now. See you next time.)
[20:52:50] <Khepra> you could whip up a quick upgrade + optional restart on boot up
[20:52:56] <physkets> Hmm... ya, the use-times are arbitrary and the machine is ON only at those times
[20:53:23] <Khepra> I _think_ gnome these days even recommends that. cant' remember if that's on debian as well or just fedorah. it went full window with requiring restart, then it upgrades during reboot cycle
[20:53:28] *** Quits: beaver (~beaver@user/pong) ()
[20:53:37] <Khepra> full windows* I mean
[20:53:58] <physkets> ah, okay, so as long as it instructs the user to restart, that's fine... but this will be Xfce
[20:54:05] <Khepra> or juist don't upgrade and do it ourself manually once a month

[20:54:49] <Khepra> oh xfce... well, unattended upgrades is a timer + background service, but that has the effect of breaking FF and some other things
[20:55:41] <Khepra> to be honest, I've stopped recommending tech unsavvy users to use linux. there was too much grief. windows, for all its faults, actually got the upgrade + click here to restart pegged down so even tech unsavvy users can deal with it
[20:56:39] <physkets> Hmm... yeah, I kinda agree with what you say about Windows..
[20:57:03] <physkets> But yes, I could do the upgrades myself, remotely.
[20:57:51] <Khepra> then again, even in gnome, the software update popup will show up, the user can click to ugprade and just restart the affected running programs or entire computer if instructed.
[20:58:06] <mtn> physkets: the type of user you are describing will not follow safe practises online, so updating is likely your least security problems
[20:58:14] <physkets> Khepra: One last thing. Is there any simple Graphical GUI updating interface that a non-root, no-sudo user could use to upgrade? One that is simple and intuitive? Not complex like Synaptic.
[20:58:46] <physkets> mtn: Well, they stick to a fixed set of actions, so that isn't too much of a worry.
[20:59:00] <mtn> physkets: then they can easily do an update ;)
[20:59:17] <physkets> Yes... but can they do so as a non-sudo user?
[20:59:29] <mtn> physkets: what is wrong with sudo?
[20:59:31] <physkets> And without the terminal?
[20:59:41] <mtn> physkets: sure, use synaptic
[21:00:08] <physkets> mtn: Nothing; just that I would have to allow the user sudo privileges... easier not to.
[21:00:12] <Khepra> physkets: the software update applet does that on gnome. dunno about xfce
[21:00:22] <physkets> mtn: Well sure, but synaptic is too complex
[21:00:24] <mtn> physkets: and most distros have an update gui
[21:00:35] <physkets> mtn: Yes, and I'm asking about Debian

[21:01:13] <physkets> Khepra: Ah, yes; Gnome, unfortuately is too alien for the user. Xfce hits the right notes.

[21:01:26] <physkets> Oh! I will look into this
[21:01:55] <Khepra> physkets: gnome has "classic" session mode which is basically gnome before gnome3 shell which is basically the same look as xfce
[21:01:58] <physkets> So I'm guessing a there will have to be a program with a GUI that uses this interface?
[21:02:17] <physkets> Khepra: huh... I had no idea Gnome had that. Will look into that as well.
[21:02:32] <Khepra> frankly, on linux, the amount of opinions and bloat that gnome has and annoys ME as power user, I can imagine how well that would work for a tech nonsavvy user

[21:19:09] <Khepra> okay. btw, you don't have to call the files like that. filenames are arbitrary. coulda just named them  eth{0,1,2}.link
[21:19:27] <Khepra> cheche: and then you also have .network units for addressing, and you're actually using systemd-networkd, and not ifupdown?
[21:21:09] <cheche> ok . change file names. I do not use .network units. I was using /etc/network/interfaces
[21:21:53] <Khepra> cheche: I don't think that works. unless I'm wrong and systemd will consider .link units separately, I think you need to use full systemd-networkd for networking
[21:23:08] <cheche> I had change like this https://paste.debian.net/1235766/
[21:23:17] <Khepra> hrm, the manpage says udev uses the .link units, so networkd might not actually be needed

[22:02:49] <Khepra> cheche: in which part? unfortunately ethX ordering is buggy, that's why systemd came up with "predictable naming", which has all the same problems, but for different reasons
[22:03:32] <Khepra> I mean you can always just leave "predictable" names and not bother with MAC binding, and keep on using /etc/network/interfaces. just be careful when you change PCI topology, things might change
[22:08:36] <cheche> sorry, but for me in the old days.... install a new system and eth0 was the predictable name. :-) Now days it could be enpXsY
[22:09:26] <Khepra> cheche: the ethX renaming is buggy HARDWARE. BIOS. it has always been a problem as you can very well see here. ethX is used, meaning udev is NOT trying to force a predictable name, so this is as raw as it gets.
[22:09:55] <cheche> If you use something like "etherwake" it always assume that you main interface was eth0. Now you need to find you which enp2sp0 and execute etherwake -i enp2sp0
