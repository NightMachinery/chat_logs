[05:02:08] <velix> somiaj: There was a talk from the Knoppix guy and he said, it's about impossible to get rid of systemd.
[05:02:24] <velix> somiaj: Because many packages in Debian were compiled against systemd only.
[05:02:27] <somiaj> !remove systemd
[05:02:27] <dpkg> To use an init system other than systemd in jessie, install the systemd-shim package (for logind) and remove the systemd-sysv package: aptitude install systemd-shim sysvinit-core systemd-sysv-.  To stick with sysvinit for wheezy->jessie upgrades, follow the pinning advice in the release notes: http://deb.li/30Kby - See also <upstart> and <openrc>
[05:03:06] <velix> somiaj: wheezy, jessie, upstart... that's pretty old ;)
[05:03:21] <somiaj> though it might depend on what you mean by remove systemd, but debian can still work without using it as an init system.
[05:03:44] <somiaj> does systemctl status systemd-journald give you any clues why the service didnt' start?

[05:06:21] <somiaj> since this system is older, have you enabled the persistant journal (maybe this can help keep it from eating up so much memeory)
[05:07:12] <velix> No. It's "buster" with the old setting. I didn't change _anything_ to journald, since it's a core service.
[05:07:50] <somiaj> I think bullseye removed to enabling persistant jounral by default, though it is easy to toggle, though unsure if this will help with memeory ussage by writting a copy of the journal to the disk
[05:08:47] <velix> somiaj: No, it was ENABLED with bullseye, since it's systemd default now :D
[05:09:04] <somiaj> hmm, I did find a post say that jounrald memeory ussage might be similar to cache, that if your kernel usssage gets high it will give up some of the memeory.
[05:09:23] <somiaj> I meant 'moved to'...grr
[05:09:35] <velix> somiaj: I guess a reboot will fix this problem (as always). it's holiday here tomorrow. So. Let's stop the databases, create a snapshopt and reboot it :D

[07:12:43] <brachamh> with bullseye, what is the default network management system?
[07:13:50] <somiaj> depends
[07:14:12] <somiaj> the installer always uses the debian /etc/network/interfaces file which is most like the debian default
[07:14:12] <brachamh> haven't heard of that one yet
[07:14:15] <brachamh> lol
[07:14:25] <brachamh> ah ok
[07:14:36] <somiaj> but if you install a desktop, what gets pulled in depends on the desktop, gnome/kde use network manager, lxde/lxqt pull in connman
[07:14:45] <brachamh> i'm just working on setting up a new server box
[07:14:49] <somiaj> network manager nicely ignores devices in /etc/network/interfaces, connmand doesn't
[07:15:01] <somiaj> systemd-networkd is installed by default, but disabled, but it is easy to enable.
[07:15:48] <somiaj> I personally use the interfaces file for everything, but many are liking networkd as it works well with systemd and has some various improvements over the interfaces file
[07:16:06] <brachamh> ok i'll look into networkd then
[07:16:13] <brachamh> thanks somiaj !
[07:16:25] *** Joins: System_Error (~SystemErr@gateway/tor-sasl/systemerror)
[07:16:35] <somiaj> just make sure to choose and only use one, otherwise you'll get conflicts
[07:16:59] <somiaj> so if using networkd make sure you don't have network-manager or connman installed, and remove everything except lo from the interfaces file
[07:17:10] <brachamh> for sure
[07:17:48] <brachamh> usually network sets up on install, but this server box has two network interfaces and for some reason neither of them show a connection during install
[07:18:28] <somiaj> The installer uses the interfaces file, which is the debian standard and probably what most would call default (unless they install a DE)
[07:18:29] <jim> what's the bug url for kde... bugs.debian.org/kde?
[07:18:55] <somiaj> jim: This almost sounds like the window manager, so maybe use the window manager package?
[07:19:09] <brachamh> you're right, that is what i'd call default
[07:19:33] <jim> what's that thing called... kwin?
[07:19:39] <somiaj> jim: so maybe kwin-x11 or kwin-wayland depending on if using x11 or wayland
[07:20:15] <jim> also how do I get stable (I'm looking at unstable)
[07:20:51] <somiaj> usually all the bugs are there, there is an advanced search you can use to search by tags (such as bugs that effect certain codenames) but often times bugs don't get tagged correctly
[07:21:14] *** Joins: noarb (~noarb@user/noarb)
[07:21:28] <jim> ok,,'
[07:22:09] <jim> so the url for kwin bugs is gonna be bugs.debian.org/kwin-x11
[07:22:59] <somiaj> that is probably where I would start
[07:24:43] *** Joins: Hash (~stoned@is.coding.when.stoned.io)
[07:25:20] <jim> I hacked the url to get stable
[07:26:01] <somiaj> I would still just look at all bugs
[07:26:17] <somiaj> as mentioned, not all bugs get tagged as to what release they affect
[07:30:59] *** Quits: nssy2 (~nssy@user/nssy) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[07:32:08] <jim> anyway, so I can't see anything close, apparantly no bugs in stable or unstable kde, but there are bugs in kwin-x11, both stable and unstable... I guess to see them all, I'd remove the part of the url that selects which branch?
[07:33:21] <jim> for now, I'll wait awhile (week or two?) before asking again
[07:33:53] <jim> thanks for your help and support, I appreciate it

[11:47:43] <Khepra> Am I missing some tool or framework that would streamline this... building packages on debian, say !ssb'ing a bunch of them. I need two debootstrap'ed containers, both configured for dpkg-buildflags I want, both with same sources.list, both with same build deps installed via mk-build-deps, both with localize repos from those build packages so locally built packages can be installed/upgraded-to so other
[11:47:49] <Khepra> packages can be built with them as build deps....

[11:48:24] <Khepra> this is VERY convoluted work, manual, I'm writing nontrivial shell scripts to automate all that....  am I reinventing the wheel and there's already tooling for this?

[11:50:41] <Khepra> I looked at last two, but, either I'm missing something, or they can't do recursive builds.
[11:50:59] <Khepra> for example, to !ssb mesa, I also need to !ssb libdrm and then _install_ ssb'ed libdrm in the environment where mesa is to be built
[11:51:27] <Khepra> that's why I keep persistent containers for 64-bit and 32-bit (debootstrap'ed), and am syncing the work with some shell scripts
[11:52:14] <ansgar> They don't do ordering, but installing additional local packages is possible (at least for some of those; I haven't used all)
[11:52:42] <Khepra> I also need to patch software because mesa wants llvm that's not available in Stable, so I'm patching out the control file for llvm11

[13:34:33] <Khepra> if there was a bug in gedit, in the way it used gtksourceview, and then it was fixed, logic implies you see what the fix was and if it can be applied to your code.
[13:34:57] <Khepra> meanwhile, I doubt you'll find someone here willing to do what you want. so, better try to find the solution yourself.
[13:36:38] <Khepra> and also, this not being about a debian package or a bug in one, it's a bit offtopic here, and you'll likely find better help in a devel-specific channel. there's #gtk, and #gnome, and you can ask alis for more.
[13:36:51] <dob1> why if I do for example "curl https://somesite" I don't see curl request status but if I do  echo $(curl https://somesite)  I see it?

[15:23:14] <Khepra> cadmio: you missed the part where I told you to look at the versions on the left side, for mousepad. binary packages built from taht source package, for debian branches
[15:23:43] <Khepra> so on the left side of that tracker page, in the Versions box, is      stable:  0.5.2-1.   click that. that leads to the binary package page

[15:38:26] <cadmio> this is my program https://github.com/gioretikto/litos if you try to compile you'll se a lot of warnings
[15:39:26] <Khepra> cadmio: the question is really does anything in version 3 prevent you from achieving what you want in your program. that said, yes, I suppose you can try porting and building v5 just for your use case, maybe you can start with the deb-src for 4 and adapt for 5
[15:41:36] <cadmio> where can I fetch it?
[15:43:56] <cadmio> I mean if there's one debian official version that I can compile
[15:47:04] <Khepra> cadmio: `apt source gtksourceview4`  as a regular user, it installs and unpacks the debsrc into the directory where you invoked it. you need deb-src URLs enabled in sources.list

[15:54:09] <Khepra> seems like 5 would be a hugest PITA to install, as it requires gtk 3.99 or newer, so you'd have to build that too as it's not supported in debian
[15:56:29] <cadmio> so by installing https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtksourceview/-/tree/gtksourceview-5-0 I've also the dev package and can compile programs?
[15:57:07] <Khepra> "dev package", on debian, is just files from the upstream source separated out, for the purpose of building packages that link to that. headers and supporting files
[15:57:38] <Khepra> when you download the source git repo, you're downloading the entire source, which, yes, you can use to build and link other programs against.

[15:59:07] <cadmio> yes indeed I could cause a mess

[17:37:03] <PerfDave> If you break it you get to keep both halves.
[17:37:46] <Khepra> actually openssh server doesn't care about permissions, only ownership

[21:43:43] <xx> `dig resolver.dnscrypt.info` should show the dns resolver you're actually using
[21:43:59] <Khepra> with systemd-resolved, that's the stub resolver and then you look its config to see where, in turn, it forwards dns queries
[21:45:32] <Khepra> xx: that's from teh same toolset, bind9-dnsutils and gives the same result, with dig being a much more functional dns swiss knife
[21:46:33] <xx> Khepra: I wasn't talking about the tool in particular, I was mentioning that trying to resolve resolver.dnscrypt.info will reply with the actual DNS server you're using
[21:46:49] <xx> host/nslookup/dig/drill will all do the same
[21:47:19] <f8e4_> xx where is it listed though, SERVER: IP(is my router)
[21:47:29] <f8e4_> i look for what router uses then since i use it i guess
[21:47:37] <Khepra> well technically, resolver.dnscrypt.info only gets the IP address from where the DNS request came, not the actual resolver
[21:47:43] <f8e4_> is it listed in the output, eg a0.info.afiliat-nst.info ..

[21:50:41] <Khepra> dnscrypt lists my ISP as the originating IP, but I use the resolver in my LAN, and I'm 100% sure the ISP is not hijacking the requests

[21:55:02] <Khepra> f8e4_: DNS over TLS, DNS over HTTPS, or rely on DNSSEC that the response isn't altered.
[21:55:30] <Khepra> f8e4_: ultimately, only DNSSEC verifies that the response is as intended by the authority that signed it. even DoH cannot vouch for hops outside of its network
[21:55:31] <f8e4_> xx ;push is commented, so defaults but which?
