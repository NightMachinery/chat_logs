[13:14:58] <FromGitter> <rossvor> It's seems that nongnu.org and gnu.org is down currently, which affects spacemacs start up time, since it tries to contact them for package archive list refresh. It takes more than several minutes for a start up for me. I had a quick look at the spacemacs config and it has `dotspacemacs-elpa-timeout 5` settings, which should in theory make abort it after 5 sec of failing to connect. ‚èé But that's not what is
