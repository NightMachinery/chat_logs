[06:32:51] <mikko> how does one get regex matches as strings? i've been looking at docs and doing things like methodswith(Regex) methodswith(RegexMatch) but can't find anything to do the conversion
[06:37:31] <mikko> this works: s = "a word"; map(i -> s[i], findall(r"\w+", s))
[06:37:55] <mikko> but surely there's a better way where i get the matches directly without extra indexing operations

[06:42:58] <mikko> ah nvm, it's of course a field not a method
[06:47:20] <mikko> here's the final solution: scan(pattern::Regex, str::AbstractString) = map(x -> x.match, eachmatch(pattern, str))

[07:09:03] <neshpion> i just split on the inverse, but i suppose that might not always be possible depending on the pattern: `split(s, r"\W+")`
[07:09:33] <mikko> that's a nice trick, i'll have to keep that in mind!
[07:10:40] <neshpion> i'm not great at julia but from my limited experience it seems it's great at math and is painful to deal with strings, that's just my impression
[07:10:54] <neshpion> but i'm a bash goblin
[07:12:15] <mikko> yeah my feeling is that the general programming stuff is not quite at the same level as say python or ruby
[07:12:45] <mikko> but to do with math or matrices or dataframes works amazing
[07:12:49] <mikko> anything*
[07:13:01] <neshpion> definitely more a matlab / R replacement than a python/ruby replacement for sure
[07:14:42] <mikko> for now.. i have high hopes for the future
