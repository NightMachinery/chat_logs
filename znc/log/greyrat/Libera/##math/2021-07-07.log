[00:00:06] <rubiksdream> but i do find degrees easy because I know what a 45 degree angle looks like, and so for some random angle I can figure out what it looks like from there
[00:00:41] <rubiksdream> whereas with radians its harder for me to figure out what '23' radians means
[00:01:04] <rubiksdream> well, mathematically i know exactly what it means.. but its not going to be as easy to figure out from knowing what pi/4 radians looks like
[00:01:05] <rex_victor> biberao: sounds about right; just make a drawing and from there you see what to add or substract
[00:01:30] <biberao> rex_victor: im confused with what it means whats the smallest postive
[00:01:41] <rex_victor> rubiksdream: yeah I agree, when building something degress are preferable :)
[00:01:59] <rex_victor> biberao: well you can also add 360 / 2π to any solution
[00:02:08] <rex_victor> and then again 360
[00:02:26] <biberao> rex_victor: ya i asked for degrees just to be easier
[00:02:30] <biberao> but we're using radians
[00:02:48] <rex_victor> if you take the number 1 for example
[00:02:59] <rex_victor> it's argument is 0 in the complex plane
[00:03:45] <rex_victor> but if you draw the number with modulus 1 and 360 deg, this will be also 1, just like 720 deg
[00:03:47] <rex_victor> and so on
[00:04:42] <rex_victor> I'm pretty sure there was a song in the lion king about this :)

[00:09:50] <biberao> for example
[00:09:54] <biberao> its 4th quadrant

[00:11:10] <biberao> why
[00:11:15] <biberao> i mean
[00:11:21] <biberao> its -45 degrees right
[00:11:29] <biberao> so i need to find the smallest positive
[00:11:49] <biberao> so i add 360degres
[00:11:58] <biberao> or 2pi to get 7pi/4
[00:11:59] <biberao> ?
[00:12:18] <rex_victor> yes
[00:12:28] <buster> yes, add 360 degrees. so it's -45+360=315 degrees. or -pi/4+2pi=7pi/4
[00:12:42] <biberao> when and why i have to add "pi" or "2pi"?
[00:12:57] <biberao> on the notes say on 1st quadrant and 3rd quadrant you do +- PI
[00:13:26] <rubiksdream> buster ah, nice one :)
[00:13:36] <rex_victor> is the first quadrant the one with positive x and y?
[00:13:43] <buster> yeah
[00:13:49] <rubiksdream> that 22/7 thing is a good one to remember
[00:14:00] <rex_victor> Then you shouldn't need to add anything in the first quadrant
[00:14:04] <rubiksdream> i still need to convert it to degrees in the end though

[00:17:44] <mrdata> ?
[00:18:27] <rex_victor> biberao: the problem about all this is, that the argument function is not bijective; but mathematicians love bijectiveness so we cheat a little and say ok you don't get to use all possible angles but we restrict ourselves
[00:19:36] <rex_victor> and there are two more or less natural choises for restrictions: [0,2π)/[0,360) or (-π,π]/(-180,180]
[00:21:29] <buster> not a function, you mean? it's the inverse of something that isn't a bijection
[00:21:40] <rubiksdream> even though its not bijective, what is important is that g : R_>0 x R -> R^2 \setminus {0} , g(r,theta) = r(costheta,sintheta) is a local diffeomorphism
[00:21:43] <buster> the inverse of (something that isn't a bijection)

[21:05:13] <Z-module> well, close. The precise statement is: (i) If M is a Z-module, then (as simply part of the axioms) M is already an abelian group.   (ii) If A is an abelian group, to make A a Z-module you're forced set set  1a = a  for every a in A, and then that forces (-1)a = the additive inverse of a in A which we usually denote -a, and then for each positive integer n,  na  is forced to be the sum of n copies of a in A, and for negative n,  na  is
[21:05:13] <Z-module> forced to be the sum of n copies of -a in A.  So there's exactly one possible operation of Z on A that makes A a Z-module.
[21:05:25] <Z-module> sorry, sum of |n| copies of -a

[21:13:34] *** Quits: notzmv (~zmv@user/notzmv) (Remote host closed the connection)
[21:17:54] <Z-module> the main module axiom needed for that is  (r + s)m = rm + sm   for all r, s in the ring, all m in the module A.  You also have to prove that 0_S m = 0_M   for any m in any S-module M, where 0_M means the identity element of M as a group, and 0_S means the zero element of the ring S.  Proving this is quite easy.

[21:19:18] <Z-module> If you're proving this stuff from scratch, from the module axioms, it pays to have separate notations for the group addition of the module and the additive group addition of the ring, and for the 0 (group identity element) of the module and the 0 element of the ring.
[21:20:20] <Z-module> I'm sure someone has this all there in gory detail on the web somewhere, with all the distinct notations, etc. There's nothing at all hard about it, other then keeping careful track of what elements are from where, what operations are in what.

[21:24:14] <Z-module> So in an R-module M, there are *four* separate operations to keep track of:  addition of any two module elements in M;   addition of any two ring elements in R;  multiplication of any two ring elements in R;  the thing that ties stuff together, the "module action" of R on M

[23:23:04] <rubiksdream> if z ,w \in D (unit disk), is there a holomorphic map f : D -> D, s.t. f(z) = |z| and f(w) = |w|?
[23:23:11] <rubiksdream> i hope there is
[23:28:58] <tolarz> hm, |.| is not holomorphic?
[23:29:01] <tolarz> QQ
[23:29:04] <tolarz> i once knew this
[23:29:31] <rubiksdream> no | | isn't holomorphic
[23:31:04] <Z-module> no non-constant real-valued function is, in fact
[23:31:16] <Z-module> non-constant holomorphic maps are open maps
[23:31:44] <rubiksdream> yeah
[23:32:22] <tolarz> Z-module: huh, sin(-) is holo
[23:32:24] <Z-module> oh wait, that wasn't your question at all!
[23:32:43] <Z-module> is your question just about some fixed pair  z and w  in D ?
[23:32:48] <rubiksdream> yes
[23:32:52] <Z-module> hen yes
[23:32:56] <Z-module> then* yes
[23:33:06] <rubiksdream> sweet, is there an easy example?
[23:33:29] <Z-module> f = identity map, z = 0, w = 1/2
[23:33:44] <rubiksdream> i mean for any z,w (fixed)
[23:33:46] <tolarz> Z-module | no non-constant real-valued function is, in fact
[23:33:51] <tolarz> ah this follows from cauchy-riemann eqs?
[23:33:54] <Z-module> yes
[23:33:58] <tolarz> but it needs to be phrased on domains
[23:34:07] <rubiksdream> my question was, given z,w (fixed) is there a holo map f : D -> D sending z and w to their moduluses
[23:34:07] <tolarz> so it doesn't apply to, e.g., sin(-): R -> R
[23:34:23] <rubiksdream> not if there is a map that works for some z,w
[23:34:33] <Z-module> right, any time you talk about a holomorphic function, its domain must be a nonempty plane-open subset of C
[23:34:55] <Z-module> tolarz, a non-constant holomorphic map can set R into R, that's not a problem
[23:35:04] <Z-module> it just can't send its whole plane-open domain into R
[23:35:11] <Z-module> (or into any other set with empty interior)
[23:36:37] <rubiksdream> my question was : Given z,w \in D (arbitrary), is there some associated holomorphic map f_{z,w} : D -> D, such that f_{z,w}(z) = |z| and f_{z,w}(w) = |w|
[23:36:50] <rubiksdream> not whether there is some such example for some such z,w in particular
[23:37:11] <Z-module> rubiksdream: if z_1, z_2, ... is any sequence of pairwise distinct points of the plane having no limit point (that means |z_n| -> infty), then there are entire functions f having any prescribed values you like at each z_n, in fact also any prescribed values you like for the first finitely many derivatives at each z_n  (even with the number of such derivatives varying with n and being unbounded over n)
[23:37:31] <cherim> D->D
[23:37:32] <rubiksdream> right, but I am insisting f is a self map of the unit disk
[23:37:39] <rubiksdream> im not asking for any old function
[23:37:50] <rubiksdream> im aware of the result you just stated
[23:38:00] <rubiksdream> D is the unit disk, and f needs to map D into itself
[23:38:21] <Z-module> I'm sure it's easy to construct such an f_{z,w}
