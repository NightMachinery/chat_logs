[00:31:29] <patchie> Hi, i am new to git. I downloaded a git repo from github the other day. I am now doing some changes to some of the files, but i dont want to upload anything of my changes, as i just want to make addons to the existing application. They now released new code, and i want to update my local copy, without uploading my changes, and also without overwriting my changes without me knowing about it.  Btw,
[00:31:29] <patchie> i am using VScode with git integrated.
[00:32:04] <osse> patchie:  have you committed the changes you did ?
[00:32:33] <patchie> i only downloaded the data once, never issued any other git commands after that
[00:32:49] <osse> ok
[00:33:00] <osse> do these steps:  git stash   git pull   git stash pop
[00:33:27] <patchie> what will it do? will it ask me if it has to overwrite any changes i did?
[00:33:57] <osse> it will temporarily stow away your changes, grab the updates, then bring back your changes

[00:35:45] <osse> no
[00:35:50] <patchie> good :P
[00:35:59] <osse> but you can create your own copy of that repo and upload to that
[00:36:10] <patchie> yeah, called a fork, right?

[01:28:12] <jinsun>  it is just that gitk waits for the terminal to show nothing then after refreshing it shows nothing too
[01:32:02] <jinsun> I can sort of replicate the issue in my work computer by doing an interactive rebase and aborting in between, I am doing it with vscode + gitlens, maybe vscode is messing with the files somehow, let me try without vscode

[04:55:48] <wallbroken> i explain what my goal is:
[04:56:00] <wallbroken> i had 2 branch
[04:56:07] <wallbroken> 1) multi-user
[04:56:12] <wallbroken> 2) multi-user-registration
[04:56:27] <wallbroken> my goal is remove multi-user
[04:56:36] <wallbroken> and then rename multi-user-registration to multi-user
[04:57:19] <BtbN> renaming branches is not a thing I believe
[04:57:35] <BtbN> just force push the desired commit there
[04:57:35] <wallbroken> so on the client side i removed multi-user branch
[04:57:45] <wallbroken> then i renamed multi-user-registration
[04:57:50] <wallbroken> to multi-user

[04:58:17] <BtbN> can't do that without force

[05:24:40] <BtbN> You "renamed" the branch locally, yes
[05:24:47] <BtbN> Github does not care what you do locally until you push it
[05:25:37] <BtbN> assuming your working dir is clean, that rename procedure is equialent of hard-resetting multi-user to ..-registration, and then deleting the later

[05:26:05] <wallbroken> but is what i've done
[05:26:11] <wallbroken> why when i do push i get an error?
[05:26:22] <BtbN> Because you are trying to do a non-fast-forward push
[05:26:38] <wallbroken> multi-user that now i see on client side is the multi-user-registration after renaming
[05:26:38] <BtbN> you can only (non-force) push commits that are direct children of the remote HEAD
[05:26:57] <wallbroken> i don't get this point
[05:27:11] <wallbroken> what is non-fast-forwwrd push?

[11:33:03] <jancoow> Hi. I want to setup a project structure to work with submodules. In development; it happens that things change insi[12:04:55] <osse> I can't find a way to reorder it
[12:05:11] <tsujp> hmm `git log --reverse` does indeed reverse but then I still have to press `G` to go to the bottom

[12:05:58] <osse> hmm

[12:06:15] <osse> the outpout is reversed, so why do you want to go to the bottom
[12:06:52] <tsujp> because with --reverse the `HEAD` is at the bottom
[12:07:16] <tsujp> if I want to view more than my terminal's height of commits (which is often) I need to now press `G`
[12:07:17] <osse> wasn't that what you wanted?

[12:07:40] <tsujp> It is
[12:07:49] <tsujp> Okay imagine you have 100 commits, `git log` shows `HEAD` the top
[12:08:10] <tsujp> Now `git log --reverse` shows the oldest commit at the top (good) but now because there are so many commits you have to scroll all the way down to view `HEAD`
[12:08:21] <tsujp> Is there a flag (I cannot see any) that automatically focuses `HEAD` with git log?
[12:08:33] <tsujp> So that I don't have to press `G` (vim command for "go to the end") with `git log`
[12:08:42] *** Joins: igemnace (~ian@user/igemnace)
[12:09:41] <osse> you could override the pager
[12:10:06] <osse> git config pager.log 'less +/HEAD'
[12:10:20] <tsujp> Ah ok
[12:10:29] <tsujp> Yeah I was gonna ask how to do that via git config instead of bash alias
[12:10:34] <tsujp> Okay this is awesome, thanks for the help osse :)
[12:11:11] <osse> it also sounds a bit like you just want git log -n 10 or git log origin/master..master or something like that
