[07:35:07] <vim_fans> hi,there. I got a problem with utf-8 format .    i received a post request which's txt/xml . Encoding.UTF-8.getString(buffer) return noting.
[07:36:10] <JakeSays> vim_fans: how long is buffer?
[07:36:47] <vim_fans> JakeSays: 1000000(which is enough for the stream)
[07:37:21] <JakeSays> vim_fans: ok how many valid bytes does it contain
[07:37:29] <vim_fans> 647
[07:37:46] <JakeSays> have you looked at them?
[07:38:10] <vim_fans> but encoding.unicode.getstring(buffer) return some result. but is not the correctly farmmat
[07:38:26] <vim_fans> JakeSays: what do you mean looked at them ?
[07:38:38] <vim_fans> I can't see the xml content
[07:38:40] <JakeSays> in the debugger. have you looked at the bytes
[07:39:02] <vim_fans> JakeSays: you mean print the item of byte array?
[07:39:29] <JakeSays> well, you could do that, but it'd be easier just to look at them in the debugger
[07:40:23] <vim_fans> i did it. but the result seems very wired .it was not binary number confused
[07:42:29] <JakeSays> well, Encoding.UTF8.GetString() will parse the entire buffer, and your buffer isn't valid because it has 1,000,000-647 invalid bytes
[07:42:56] <JakeSays> although it may ignore the trailing ones. i dont remember
[07:43:50] <JakeSays> vim_fans: try Encoding.UTF8.GetString(buffer, 0, 647)
[07:44:24] <JakeSays> but it's difficult to diagnose the issue w/o seeing the 647 bytes

[10:41:29] <tsujp> Okay I've spent some time reading about Moq and restructured a lot of my code but I am on the last bit I cannot figure out
[10:41:35] <ap5> JakeSays, ah. Didn't see that. Just saw "stream" and it returns "it is empty"
[10:41:52] <ap5> tsujp, tell us
[10:42:30] <tsujp> I cannot move the use of a dependency in my class to dependency injection (that I know of) because the thing I want to dependency inject requires a run-time value (best way I can explain it). I'm preparing a gist now, sec
[10:44:48] <ap5> But then you need to move that value out of the constructor, and into the method(s) that need it
[10:46:53] <vim_fans> let's say these are the post data '<xml><name>vito><age>15</age></xml>'   what i can get through previos code is vito     15.
[10:47:03] <vim_fans> why the result missing xml tags?
[10:48:10] <ap5> tsujp, or!! You need to wrap that new of the object, that takes the runtime value into its constructor into a factory, that can be added to the IoC, then at runtime you depend on that factory method, that you can inject into your constructor, and then do myFactory.Construct(runTimeValue);
[10:48:59] <ap5> vim_fans because you are not viewing the raw respoonse in the browser
[10:49:08] <tsujp> Here's the gist https://gist.github.com/tsujp/d652e170c37032aa40ed87b3fab13af4
[10:50:08] <ap5> tsujp, wrap the subscriptionId into some kind of options class, and inject that into IoC
[10:50:40] <vim_fans> ap5: then how should i process the xml data without these tags?
[10:50:40] <tsujp> The `subscriptionId` is determined at runtime as part of the request though ap5, sec let me add that bit in
[10:50:54] <ap5> Ah, you can't
[10:51:57] <ap5> tsujp, then you need to rap your NetworkManagementClient in something
[10:52:07] <ap5> That thing you wrap it in, you can mock
[10:52:09] <tsujp> Refresh the gist
[10:52:46] <ap5> Wrap the NetworkManagementClient
[10:53:32] <tsujp> Okay I can wrap the NetworkManagementClient so you call a method which accepts only a `subscriptionId` and that returns a NetworkManagementClient but I still need to provide the `subscriptionId`
[10:53:47] <tsujp> And line 29 where I `new NetworkManagementClient` still exists in the ConfigureService
[10:54:11] <tsujp> So I don't see how that solves the issue of me wanting to dependency inject the NetworkManagementClient in ConfigureService only after I know the `subscriptionId` in Foo

[11:19:36] <ap5> tsujp, it wraps NetworkManagementClient, so you can mock it. Wasn't that your problem? Then you can inject the gateway into your Service
[11:19:55] <ap5> tsujp, well i dont know if you have
[11:19:57] <ap5> :)
[11:20:02] <tsujp> So in `Foo.DoSomething` I first call `_configureService.SetClient(subscriptionId)` and this `SetClient` method sets the `_client` property on the `ConfigureService`
[11:20:08] <tsujp> No I mean is that a (non stupid) solution?
[11:20:47] <tsujp> It doesn't wrap the NetworkManagementClient you're wrapping DoSomething no?
[11:22:00] <tsujp> Like, you're calling `client.DoSomething()` but that's really, really confusing to me because (1) it's got the same method name and (2) that's not how it's being used
[11:22:04] <tsujp> Let me further expand the gist
[11:22:43] <ap5> tsujp, i really don't know if that is really really confusing, because i don't know your entire codebase
[11:23:20] <ap5> The SetClient solution feels like a hack
[11:23:29] <tsujp> Can you refresh the gist page and see line 33-36?

[11:23:33] <ap5> Well, i need to work on my work problems :)

[11:25:08] <ap5> tsujp, but how are you going to mock out the management factory? Isn't that the whole deal?
[11:25:49] <tsujp> So that's what I need to mock in this case right? I need to mock the management factory so that it returns a mock NetworkManagementClient?
[11:27:20] <ap5> I dont know :D
[11:27:49] <ap5> Didn't you ask how we would construct the code so you could mock NetworkManagementClient?
[11:27:58] <tsujp> Yes
[11:28:20] <tsujp> That's what I want. If I can mock NetworkManagementClient then I can mock when it calls `client.SecurityRules.ListAsync` on line 34
[11:28:25] <ap5> You do that my implementing my Gateway, and injecting that into your service
[11:28:26] <tsujp> How do I do that given the provided gist
[11:28:37] <tsujp> But your gateway does `client.DoSomething()`
[11:28:39] <tsujp> What is that method
[11:28:46] <ap5> IT IS AN EXAMPLE
[11:28:48] <tsujp> Why does the azure provided NetworkManagementCLient have a custom method on it
[11:29:01] <ap5> Jesus
[11:29:02] <ap5> :D
[11:29:11] <ap5> I am not writing your code
[11:30:06] <ap5> My Gateway is an example. If you want to mock out the call to ListAsync, then you add a method in the Gateway, that news up a client and calls that method, then you can mock that call as well
[11:30:43] *** Joins: alguien (~alguien@user/alguien)
[11:31:29] <tsujp> I don't think that's going to work
[11:31:53] <ap5> Why?
[11:32:11] <tsujp> Because I have already tried it (I think) and I don't understand your example beyond it's an interface which can be mocked
[11:32:27] <ap5> I know it will, and that you then can mock the calls out, but i am not writing the whole shebang
[11:32:37] <tsujp> But it's in the wrong place (?) isn't a constructor which takes injection (?) and I don't know if you're providing that example to wrap Foo or ConfigureService
[11:32:58] <tsujp> I'm not asking you to write the whole thing, I just literally do not get it because everything in C# land is 5000000000000000000000000000x more complicated than it ought to be
[11:33:12] <ap5> You add the gateway to the IoC and add it to the service constructor
[11:34:16] <tsujp> ConfigureService needs a NetworkManagementClient, called `client`. This `client` needs a value only known at runtime (otherwise this would be a trivial dependency injection) and that value at runtime is known in Foo which calls the ConfigureService. I want to unit test ConfigureService using Nunit and Moq. I don't know how to provide a mocked
[11:34:16] <tsujp> `client` to ConfigureService short of using a setter which sets a client which feels like a hack.

[11:36:10] <ap5> You wrap the NetworkManagementClient, and then you can mock it :) That is my answer
[11:36:50] <tsujp> it's already wrapped in the ManagementClientFactory
[11:37:08] <tsujp> And as I said, ConfigureService does not have a constructor at all, so how is it meant to be depenency injected
[11:37:21] <tsujp> Given the fact it needs a runtime value to be used in production code
[11:37:34] <tsujp> I'm not going to rewrite the entire codebase just so it's testable but unuseable in production
[11:38:58] <ap5> You can't mock out your static management factory class
[11:39:10] <ap5> If you dont want to rewrite it, well then you can test it
[11:39:38] <vim_fans> ap5: system.net.http  could be found in .net framework 4
[11:39:47] <biberu> tsujp: perhaps this was already answered above, but you can inject things that require additional parameters at runtime just fine, what issue are you experiencing with that?
[11:39:48] <vim_fans> ap5: how to resolve it ?
[11:40:15] <tsujp> I don't know how to do that and what I see on the microsoft documentation has hardcoded values only in Startup.cs which is useless for me biberu
[11:41:08] <biberu> tsujp: where should this value come from? is it available to the di container or to the component you're injecting into?
[11:42:06] <tsujp> Check this gist biberu https://gist.github.com/tsujp/d652e170c37032aa40ed87b3fab13af4 -- Foo receives a DI'd class `ConfigureService` and ConfigureService itself has _no constructor_ because the thing I want to mock, the NetworkManagementClient (line 30) requires a value `subscriptionId` that I only know when `DoSomething` in `Foo` is called
[11:42:36] <tsujp> There's a lot of indirection here that I cannot simplify any further and I don't know what to do, cannot find the answer in docs (that I know of) or google
[11:43:11] <biberu> tsujp: so essentially ConfigureService is in an invalid state until it's been given additional data *after* initialization?
[11:43:20] <tsujp> Correct
[11:43:26] <biberu> this is strong sign that you need another component in your design
[11:43:58] <biberu> e.g. something that is responsible for getting that id, that you can then use to construct a *valid* ConfigureService, that can be passed around as you need
[11:44:26] <biberu> meeting, bbiaw
[11:44:55] <tsujp> So this means I should stop DI-ing ConfigureService itself
[11:45:22] <biberu> not necessarily, but it should be *valid* when injected
[11:46:17] <tsujp> I'm confused on what could even be the solution here, I could DI another class which has a single method `GiveMeAConfigureService(string subscriptionId)` and then call that method at line 12 which would result in a valid ConfigureService?
[11:47:32] <tsujp> Just to be clear: The ConfigureService is invalid because it needs a NetworkManagementService (this is a Microsoft provided type) which ONLY accepts the runtime value via a constructor, so I cannot DI NetworkManagementService into ConfigureService's constructor unless I have the calling-class provide it directly.. idk
[11:47:55] <tsujp> Like, i just _do not know_ every DI tutorial or example online conventiently has DI classes which can have properties set after the fact blah blah
[11:48:18] <tsujp> But Microsoft's NetworkManagementClient class has very specifically this field in it `private readonly string _subscriptionId;`
[11:48:36] <tsujp> So I _cannot_ set that after it's been DI'd so I cannot use DI for it so I cannot mock it so I cannot test it
[11:48:48] <tsujp> But I cannot change it because it's an Azure SDK I need for the functionality of the code...
[11:48:54] <biberu> since new ConfigureService() is nonsensical, you can't use it like that, it should have a constructor
[11:49:05] <biberu> that's where you inject the id or whatever service it needs to be useful
[11:49:37] <biberu> once you have that in place you either set it up to inject ConfigureService directly, or a ConfigureServiceFactory of some sort, it depends
[11:50:24] <biberu> having classes that need mutable properties set after initialization to be useful is a great way to shoot yourself in the foot
[11:50:42] <tsujp> I don't want that to be the case just to be clear
[11:51:01] <tsujp> To explain again because I don't know if I am using the correct words here

[11:51:31] <tsujp> See on line 29 (even though its commented out) where I do `var client =  new ...` (forget the ManagementClientFactory crap)
[11:51:41] <tsujp> That's the canonical example of: put that in the constructor and use DI instead, yeah?
[11:51:43] <tsujp> No problem, easy
[11:51:46] <tsujp> E X C E P T
[11:52:32] <tsujp> It requires a parameter `subscriptionId` which is not hardcoded from AppSettings.JSON, not from an environment variable. That value comes from the database entity which is fetched from the REST request which calls this stuff, i.e. it's dynamic
[11:52:54] <tsujp> So if I dependency inject the NetworkManagementClient into the ConfigureService, the NetworkManagementClient won't be valid
[11:53:02] <tsujp> And so netiehr will the ConfigureService using it
[11:53:29] <tsujp> Unelss there is a way to provide arguments to a depdency injected constructor that are NOT hardcoded or from environment variables or from AppSettings.json
[11:53:33] <tsujp> I don't see how this can be solved
[11:53:44] <tsujp> If you can provide arguments to a DI constructor then I can just pass `subscriptionId` and this is solved
[11:53:55] <biberu> you can
[11:54:08] <tsujp> How I haven't seen anything that isn't from an env var or appsettings.json
[11:54:10] <biberu> how depends on where that value is known
[11:54:28] <tsujp> The value is known after ConfigureService itself is DId
[11:54:40] <tsujp> So I assume I need to first remove ConfigureService being DId in Foo
[11:54:45] <biberu> by what component?
[11:55:29] <tsujp> The calling component (which is an ASP.NET controller) calls `Foo.DoSomething()`
[11:55:38] <tsujp> So in both that controller and Foo.DoSomething the `subscriptionId` is known
[11:55:54] <tsujp> The class `Foo` uses the `ConfigureService` via DI
[11:56:14] <tsujp> The `ConfigureService` uses the Azure SDK client class `NetworkManagementClient`
[11:56:21] *** Joins: svm_invictvs (~svm_invic@user/svm-invictvs/x-6696469)
[11:56:34] <biberu> so Foo knowns subscriptionId, but Foo needs a ConfigureService, but ConfigureService needs a subscriptionId
[11:56:40] <tsujp> Correct
[11:57:01] <biberu> you need to break that cycle
[11:57:09] <biberu> plenty of ways to do that
[11:57:32] <tsujp> Foo is `AddScoped` as follows: `services.AddScoped<IFoo, Foo>();`
[11:58:06] <biberu> a simple version would be to inject a Func<subscriptionId, IConfigureService>, or corresponding interface, then you just call that to recieve a ConfigureService once the subscriptionId is known to Foo
[11:58:55] *** Joins: SGautam (uid286066@id-286066.ilkley.irccloud.com)
[11:59:03] <tsujp> So that is injected into Foo? What is that pattern called so I can google it because I don't understand how that would be done _exactly_
[11:59:17] <biberu> that's just a factory
[12:00:02] <ap5> And it is a better solution than a static class factory, because it can then be mocked
[12:00:28] <tsujp> Ah okay, so instead of Foo being DId `ConfigureService` I just DI `ConfigureServiceFactory` and then within Foo once I know `subcriptionId` I call `ConfigureServiceFactory.GiveMeAConfigureService(subscriptonId)` right?
[12:00:42] <biberu> tsujp: perhaps this looks more familiar? interface ConfigureServiceFactory { IConfigureService Create(string subscriptionId); }
[12:00:55] <tsujp> Yep okay on the same page now biberu and ap5
[12:00:57] <tsujp> Let me try that
[12:01:03] <Nasp> Ohh jesus this again
[12:01:10] <biberu> that's just a long way of writing here's a subscriptionId, give me an IConfigureService
[12:02:07] <Nasp> tsujp:  What is your SUT in your example?
[12:02:39] <tsujp> The SUT is the ConfigureService
[12:03:05] <biberu> tsujp: note that the rule that leads to a working solution here is *refusing to allow objects to be initialized to invalid states*, adding a constructor to ConfigureService gives you a constraint that leads to a working design
[12:05:45] <Nasp> Inject your ManagementClientFactory
[12:05:57] <tsujp> I'm mixing things up to do that now
[12:06:27] <Nasp> does ManagementNetworkClient have an interface?
[12:06:42] <tsujp> It does not
[12:06:49] <Nasp> Then it wont help
[12:06:51] <tsujp> It allows mocking via a parameterless protected constructor
[12:07:07] <Nasp> Then you need to wrap ManagementNetworkClient
[12:07:44] <tsujp> Yes but ConfigureService itself is DId which uses NetworkManagementClient which tighly couples them unless DI is used which it cannot be unless this factory is made
[12:08:09] <tsujp> Here's microsoft's NetworkManagementClient class https://gist.github.com/tsujp/736915364b81b2a0221210d4a24adb2a
[12:08:25] <tsujp> Blame them for having a shitty `private readonly string _subscriptionId` that requires it to be set via constructor
[12:08:40] <tsujp> Although biberu says ` *refusing to allow objects to be initialized to invalid states*` so I assume that's actually the preferred way
[12:08:43] <tsujp> Hence: factories
[12:08:57] <Nasp> Yes
[12:10:17] <biberu> tsujp: if the client isn't usable without that id it must have a constructor that requires it, same rule as above

[12:35:49] <Nasp> Yeah i got that
[12:36:03] <Nasp> So in general you want to inject as much as possible, except method a few static helpers
[12:36:13] <Nasp> But when it comes to testing it forces  you into structuring your code in these small bits
[12:36:20] <Nasp> Which i would argue usually makes for a better design
[12:36:30] <ap5> True
[12:36:48] <ap5> I like the way IoC has made me think, especially about testing
[12:37:17] <tsujp> Yeah wanting to test that configuration service in this case kind of forced that upon me but I can see the benefit with IoC and DI now at least so far as switching things up for testing etc
[12:37:22] <Nasp> TDD even if you don't test that well or remove them afterwards, will design a smaller composable system imo

[15:22:05] <tsujp> Okay I've got another question (do DI or stuff like before lol) : Got a class I'm testing, just want to verify it computes a value correctly but in production code I don't have any use for such a value -- should I make it return the value anyway singularly for the purpose of being able to unit test it?
[15:23:23] <tsujp> The method is a `Task` and takes in a value, does some mutation, and sets that value on a 3rd party API, I could make it `Task<ReturnValue>` and check the return value (what i describe above)
[15:23:37] <tsujp> Should I instead somehow Mock the 3rd party API call here too and intercept the value it tries to set and verify that way?

[15:31:35] <biberu> tsujp: split it in two components, one that calculates the value (ideally a pure function that's easy to unit test), and one that calls the api
[15:32:36] <tsujp> Gotcha
[15:32:57] <tsujp> I have a similar pattern elsewhere however one of the calculation methods is `private` because it's an implementation detail. In that case don't test it?
[15:34:03] <biberu> tsujp: if understand you correctly it looks like this now: Stuff -> Task, but if you refactor it into (Stuff -> Value) -> Task the first step can become its own function, and what remains (hopefully) only does one thing: calls the api with the value
[15:34:46] <pandem> yeah but the issue with testing private functions is a real one
[15:34:59] <pandem> you could make it internal and use internalsvisible attribute
[15:35:19] <biberu> yeah, if just don't to make it part of your public api it should be internal
[15:36:20] <Nasp> Avoid testing private methods
[15:36:25] <Nasp> Don't expose it just for the sake of a test
[15:37:15] <biberu> if it should be private or internal depends on what it is
[15:38:16] <pandem> i think in most cases it doesn't matter that much if it's just used by other projects in the same solution but maybe that's just me
[15:38:24] <pandem> if you have more consumers then it starts to matter
[15:39:33] <biberu> solution? i'd only expose it to tests, or consider moving it to another project where it makes sense to declare it public

[20:09:46] <BSaboia> Nasp, what I want is that the list is i.e ordered so it would be faster to search for it
[20:09:59] <jonp> how big is this dictionary?
[20:10:08] <jonp> if it's "small", what you have is likely fine
[20:10:26] <BSaboia> jonp, something like 1 million entries. So I don't think it's "big"
[20:10:35] <BSaboia> It's financial terms
[20:10:37] <jonp> for "in-memory", 1e6 entries is big
[20:10:47] <jonp> unless you have like a ton of ram
[20:11:26] <BSaboia> I see
[20:11:37] <BSaboia> I never tested it fully (loading all values)
[20:11:45] <Nasp> Maybe start by that
[20:11:53] <Nasp> But don't you have a database or something for these values?
[20:12:18] <jonp> assume each key & value is 5 chars: a string itself requires 2*length+2 bytes (plus more), so you're looking at 12*1e6 bytes, just in strings.
[20:12:47] <jonp> 12 meg, in itself, isn't necessary "a lot", but each time you do your filter it'll create more and more garbage
[20:13:20] <BSaboia> Nasp, yes. But they are loaded and then they stay at the customer's app, unless you want to reload
[20:18:56] <BSaboia> So you agree that this is an alright implementation?

[20:21:51] <irwiss> BSaboia: could consider a trie too, possibly saving some memory over string->string dictionary
[20:21:58] <irwiss> for the live suggestions part
[20:23:25] <BSaboia> irwiss, yeah
[20:23:51] <BSaboia> This is O(n) and I think that it _could_ be more than O(n) in the first one, but better off afterwards on average
[20:24:03] <BSaboia> But it is also alright

[20:29:12] <BSaboia> WSL2 had some serious networking issues with Docker. But I am not using Windows right now so I don't know if it's fixed
[20:29:16] <brianonymous> thats what im using

[20:36:19] <Slade> brianonymous: you're using wsl2 with docker for windows?
[20:36:25] <brianonymous> yeah
[20:36:40] <brianonymous> its way faster in a lot of things
[20:36:45] <Slade> thats what i used to use on 10. wasnt sure if there was a new hotness
[20:36:52] <Nasp> I have issues with something in docker is memory leaking on windows
[20:36:56] <Nasp> Ends up using 50+GB
[20:36:57] <brianonymous> oh, i dunno if there is new hotness
[20:37:07] <Nasp> I think podman is the new hotness
[20:37:15] <Nasp> Since Docker desktop requires a license if you are a business
[20:39:00] <Slade> podman seems a nontrivial install on wsl2

[20:45:16] <khanred> I wish we would settle on the requirements for this feature...
[20:45:29] <khanred> Yay "agile" I guess
[20:52:32] <lz_> when i see job offers for a "build master" job, i instantly know they're full of shit
[20:53:22] <lz_> typically a company that has the shittiest build process ever and don't want to be annoyed so they'd rather ask someone to deal with it
[20:55:28] <smitty> you know its going to be a rube-golderg machine if it's someone's dedicated job
[20:55:41] <smitty> which, granted, may be required if it's some old monolithic software
[20:55:48] <khanred> We have several "deployment engineers"
[20:56:22] <khanred> I'm glad I don't touch prod
[20:57:00] <smitty> where's your sense of adventure
[20:57:09] * smitty sets the output directory in 'release' build config to an ftp
[20:57:18] <khanred> Dead, like my sense of self worth
[20:57:24] <Nasp> We have someone who's dedicated for that
[20:57:35] <Nasp> It's gotten better, but he seems to insist he's the only one fiddling with it
