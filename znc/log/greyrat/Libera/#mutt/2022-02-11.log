[00:57:25] <bmomjian> I have been using custom icons as part of index_format for a few weeks now, and particularly for reading email lists, it is a game-changer --- the icons:  https://momjian.us/tmp/icons-utf8.html
[00:58:24] <bmomjian> I can easily see what emails I have written, who has replied to my email, and what emails I have replied to, with easy to understand icons.

[07:09:28] <R2robot> bmomjian: show a screenshot :)
[07:14:36] <bmomjian> Sure.
[07:16:14] <bmomjian> https://momjian.us/tmp/mutt.png
[07:16:29] <bmomjian> These is a thread from the public Postgres hackers email list.
[07:17:00] <bmomjian> Down arrows are from me, right arrows are to me, left arrows show I replied.
[07:17:27] <bmomjian> I have never had such clear indication of email lists before --- they used to be all just threads without indication of how I was involved.
[07:19:42] <R2robot> ahh, nice
[07:20:55] <bmomjian> Thanks.  This was only possible since Debian 10 since before then, GNU screen didn't handle UTF8 properly so using mutt with UTF8 often corrupted the screen.
