[09:12:17] <lad> I have a function that takes a list "(defun p (l) (dolist (x l) (solfa x)))" that i use (p '(DO ME SO))  ... now I want to write a macro so I don't have to use list syntax: (mymacro DO ME SO). Any hints?
[09:18:13] <mfiano> something like this? [untested]: (defmacro mymacro (&body body) (alexandria:with-gensyms (x) `(dolist (,x (list ,@body)) (solfa ,x))))
[09:20:34] <moon-child> lad: why do you want to do that?
[09:20:52] <moon-child> it's generally considered unidiomatic to use a macro where a function would do
[09:21:07] <moon-child> mfiano: want &rest rather than &body there, I think
[09:21:13] <mfiano> No you don't
[09:21:16] <mfiano> It doesn't matter
[09:21:26] <mfiano> &body is a convenience to convey indentation only
[09:21:27] <moon-child> I mean in terms of semantics it's the same, but for conveying intent
[09:21:31] <moon-child> yeah
[09:22:31] <mfiano> In this case a function will not do.
[09:22:36] <moon-child> the intent here is that the remainder of the parameters are a list; not that they are the expressions of a body, so &rest is apppropriate
[09:23:14] <moon-child> mfiano: a function will not do if you want to write (my-function do me so).  It's more idiomatic to write a function and write (my-function '(do me so))
[09:23:17] <mfiano> He specifically wants a syntactic abstraction over his function that delays evaluation, a perfect use for a macro..
[09:23:30] <moon-child> (or, perhaps, (my-function 'do 'me 'so))
[09:23:44] <lad> Okay.... this is the macro: (defmacro mymacro (&rest body) (alexandria:with-gensyms (x)  `(dolist (,x (list ,@body)) (solfa ,x))))
[09:23:54] <lad> this is the call: (mymacro 'DO 'ME 'SO)
[09:24:07] <lad> I guess I have to pass in symbols still,
[09:24:09] <mfiano> That is not the call you originally desired.
[09:24:22] <lad> true, thx mfiano
[09:24:53] <lad> maybe its not possible
[09:25:13] <mfiano> It certainly is. But I would back up to moon-child's question.
[09:25:19] <mfiano> Why do you want this?
[09:31:30] <mfiano> lad: If you want the elements to not be evaluated, change the (,x (list ,@body)( to (,x ',body)
[09:31:36] <lad> mfiano, I was just wanting to make it easier to type really
[09:31:43] <mfiano> Or I suppose you could unroll it: (defmacro mymacro (&body body) `(progn ,@(mapcar (lambda (x) `(solfa ',x)) body)))
[09:31:52] <lad> sort of a DSL idea

[09:33:09] <mfiano> err typo, "...@body))", not "...@body)(" in the loop version
[09:34:16] <mfiano> lad: The latter version unrolls it to multiple calls to SOLFA, eliminating the runtime iteration.
[09:34:19] <moon-child> depending on what you're doing, it might make more sense to hoist all the notes into a single list and do some processing of it; then you would only have to quote once
[09:40:49] <lad> i guess my question is really, how to write a macro that takes arbitrary atoms/symbols that aren't defined
[09:41:35] <mfiano> by using &rest, same as a defun.
[09:41:43] <mfiano> or &body, which is essentially the same thing
[09:42:03] <lad> (foo '1 2 hi) ; The variable HI is unbound
[09:42:23] <lad> whether i use &body or &rest
[09:42:29] <mfiano> How am I supposed to know what the definition of foo is?
[09:42:43] <lad> (defmacro foo (&body body) `(list ,@body))
[09:42:47] <lad> sorry, thought i pasted it
[09:42:58] <mfiano> Well sure, you are unquoting it
[09:43:58] <mfiano> ,@ is unquote/splice
[09:44:04] <White_Flame> are you just reimplementing a form of (list 1 2 3) but with unevaluated arguments?
[09:44:14] <mfiano> I would suggest reading a book on macro basics. These are extremely fundamental concepts
[09:44:21] <White_Flame> or is there another purpose for this macro?
[09:44:47] <lad> Just want a macro that takes unevaluated arguments White_Flame
[09:45:27] <White_Flame> macros by default take source code, and return source code.  They do not evaluate their arguments, unless you generate output source code which would evaluate them
[09:45:58] <White_Flame> the only real difference now past that is if you want them as a literal list, or as a runtime-generated list
[09:46:11] <White_Flame> a literal list is easy, but you shouldn't do that if you want to modify it
[09:46:18] <White_Flame> eg (foo a b c) => '(a b c)
[09:46:40] <White_Flame> where (foo a b c) => (list 'a 'b 'c) would generate one each time the body is run
[09:46:52] <lad> White_Flame, please supply the macro that returns that
[09:47:01] <White_Flame> you have been given the first

[09:50:26] <lad> i will meditate
[09:50:38] <White_Flame> I sometimes use `(quote ,x) which might be clearer than `',x if the nesting of quotes is getting really hairy, too
[09:51:07] <mfiano> If I am ever nesting quotes I stop and break my macro up into functions.
[09:52:16] <mfiano> Really dislike large unintelligible macros, so usually break them up regardless :)

[10:51:38] <kathe> beach, you live in bordeaux, right?
[10:51:49] <beach> I do, yes.

[10:52:18] <Inline> morning kathe, i'm soo groggy bah
[10:52:27] <beach> kathe: Unimportant.  I have lived in 5 countries on 4 continents.
[10:52:54] <kathe> beach, wow, that's something. i've only lived in 2 cities outside mine in my own country.

[10:53:21] <kathe> inline, can you share why you prefer coffee over tea?
[10:53:23] <beach> But I am off topic.  So let's get back to Common Lisp.

[10:54:15] <Inline> the effect is more instant kathe, however shortlived compared to tea of course
[10:54:37] <kathe> inline, tea also has a calming effect on the nervous system due to tanin.
[10:54:45] <Inline> right
[10:54:48] <beach> kathe: If you greet everyone coming in here without uttering anything, then the channel log will be filed with your greetings.  At least limit yourself to people who start uttering something themselves.

[11:01:29] <contrapunctus> kathe: haha, not really.
[11:01:38] <moon-child> 'no netsplits' so no redundancy either?

[20:40:38] <Josh_2> ah
[20:41:16] <Josh_2> Did you check if a bridge already exists? If not then you dont want the client-server API instead you want to look at the application services API, that is how bridges like telegram and discord are implemented
[20:43:15] <contrapunctus> Ah, I see. Thanks. The existing bridge is an atrocity.

[21:41:03] <lisp123> Does Common Lisp in Emacs (e.g. via SLIME) have an equivalent to 'describe-function' which works for elisp (and also many forms that are common to both cl and elisp)?
[21:41:16] <lisp123> It's better than the Hyperspec because its easier to follow for beginners

[21:43:30] <MichaelRaskin> Does plain DESCRIBE count?
[21:44:26] <scymtym> you can use SLIME-DESCRIBE-FUNCTION or SLIME-DESCRIBE-SYMBOL but the provided information will depend on your (Common Lisp) implementation. a documentation string, if there is one, will usually be displayed. but especially for functions whose name is in the CL package, those documentation strings are usually much worse than the description in the Hyperspec

[21:48:31] <lisp123> for what is done for defun
[21:49:31] *** Joins: attila_lendvai (~alendvai@217.65.126.101)
[21:50:09] <MichaelRaskin> Yeah, some macros migh not have more (for some things there is more documentation)
[21:52:02] <scymtym> implementation specification extensions tend to have more serious documentation strings. in SBCL, this is true for TRACE and SB-EXT:RUN-PROGRAM, for example
[21:52:48] <lisp123> scymtym & MichaelRaskin, thanks for the info
[21:53:27] <MichaelRaskin> Things like defun are probably best explained in tutorial-style texts than in anything reference-style
[21:53:45] <lisp123> I agree
[21:54:18] <lisp123> I am now thinking of writing a tutorial-style guide for keywords // common packages (e.g. for hunchentoot, quicklisp, etc.), similar to describe-function
[21:54:25] <MichaelRaskin> (Also as in, tutorials exist, references are oriented on those who find tutorials insufficiently detailed)
[21:54:44] <MichaelRaskin> Ohh.
[21:55:16] <lisp123> Something that covers the most basic use, not everything (for that, there is references)
[21:55:31] <lisp123> but as it stands now, one would have to google each term, which is an additional step
[21:55:48] <lisp123> most common* use
[21:56:22] <MichaelRaskin> I am pretty sure that Â«describeÂ» uses whatever documentation strings are attached to various uses of a symbol
[21:56:49] <lisp123> how do you access describe? I didn't find it when I did M-x describe
[21:57:05] <MichaelRaskin> It's a Common Lisp function Common-Lisp:Describe
[21:57:14] <lisp123> ah
[21:57:25] <lisp123> thanks for that
[21:57:37] <scymtym> you can evaluate (describe 'SYMBOL) in common lisp or use M-x slime-describe-symbol RET SYMBOL RET
[21:57:45] <MichaelRaskin> SLIME-DESCRIBE-SYMBOL probably uses it
[21:58:10] <MichaelRaskin> (I am not sure as I don't use Emacs)
[21:58:32] <lisp123> thanks - seems to work
