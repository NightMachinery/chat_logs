I think nothing breeds appreciation like success.  and python is no doubt successful. but, wow, it strikes me as pedantic and seriously self-righteous.  I've coded in only a few languages, and python is the one where I most feel like it's always nannying me.  Perl lets me cr

[16:51:12] <krismatrix> I don't think I understand how to access static files in mojo. I am currently under the /secure umbrella...and when I want to provide them with an image, I am proving a relative url as ../images/totp/totp_1.png. When that page loads for the first time, I see the image. When I go back to the page, it doesn't load the image. It clearly has something to do with route that I provide, but I don't undertand how it is supposed to be done? 
[16:51:46] <krismatrix> Basically...the image loads fine the first time. If the form I want to submit fails, I reload the same page. When I do this, the reloaded page fails to display the image.
[16:52:52] <krismatrix> The page is route /secure/authenticator which shows an image with src="../image/totp/totp.png"  but when the form submit fails (which needs to be debugged separately), it calls /secure/authenticator/1 where the 1 displays an error message on screen. But now the image won't load.
[16:53:36] <Botje> why can't you use absolute paths for images?
[16:54:01] <Botje> ../image is relative to the current URL, so for /secure/authenticator/1 it resolves to /secure/images/...
[16:54:34] <Altreus> Always use absolute URLs for everything
[16:54:36] <Botje> alternatively i'm sure there's a helper function that calculates the correct relative path, but absolute paths keep things simple.
[16:54:56] <Altreus> It's way easier to get the software to output the absolute path than to figure out what weird thing the browser is going to be doing
[16:55:42] *** Joins: k8yun (~k8yun@user/k8yun)
[16:55:46] <Botje> the browser is not doing anything weird
[16:58:35] <krismatrix> how can I use an absolute path here? the absolute path is my local directory.
[16:59:12] <krismatrix> note...this is not a path that I am using on my controller perl file where I can use $self->app->home. The path is sent to the frontend.
[16:59:21] <krismatrix> because it is an image src=""
[16:59:49] <krismatrix> so a path like /home/krismatrix/..../images/totp/totp.png make sense to my controller file but makes no sense to the front end.
[16:59:51] <Botje> krismatrix: the absolute path is whatever your application serves.
[17:00:11] <krismatrix> I don't know what the means. Can you explain?
[17:00:15] <Botje> krismatrix: presumably you access you application at http://localhost:3000/secure/authenticator 
[17:00:18] <Botje> correct?
[17:00:37] <krismatrix> I would say I access the specific page that way yes.
[17:00:39] <Botje> the browser requests the path /secure/authenticator, and your application maps that to a controller.
[17:00:46] <Altreus> if /secure/authenticator/../image/totp/totp.png resolves then the absolute path to the image is /secure/image/totp/totp.png
[17:01:07] <Botje> when your HTML says <img src="/images/totp/totp.png"> the same process happens.
[17:01:17] <Botje> your application tries to map that URL to a controller
[17:01:44] <Botje> and presumably you configured a controller that maps everything under /images to a directory in your application
[17:02:15] <krismatrix> No...i never did that in my controller file for images.
[17:02:31] <Botje> okay, whatever. you have *something* that serves up stuff under /images
[17:02:33] <krismatrix> reply to botje's last comment on 'presumably'.
[17:02:39] <Botje> I don't have your code in front of me.
[17:03:05] <Botje> when you say <img src="../images/totp/totp.png">, the browser looks at the current URL (http://...../secure/authenticator)
[17:03:07] <krismatrix> right
[17:03:24] <Botje> because your relative url starts with .., it lops off the last bit (http://.../secure)
[17:03:40] <Botje> and appends the rest of the url (http://..../secure/images/totp/totp.png)
[17:03:58] *** Quits: zln (~zln@c83-249-48-11.bredband.tele2.se) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[17:04:04] <Botje> note that the application server always sees absolute URLs.
[17:04:29] <Botje> but if you start from http://..../secure/authenticator/1
[17:04:43] <Botje> the browser ends up retrieving http://secure/authenticator/images/totp/totp.ong
[17:04:50] <Botje> because it applied the same process.
[17:05:03] <Botje> absolute URLs take the current URL out of the equation and are directly appended to the host part of your URL.
[17:05:13] <krismatrix> ok.
[17:05:37] <Altreus> you should show your static-serving code :)
[17:05:48] <krismatrix> so to do absolute url...I should do: <img src="/secure/image/totp/totp.png">. Do I have that right?
[17:05:59] <krismatrix> Alterus...frontend or backend?
[17:06:32] <Botje> krismatrix: for example, yes. if you ahve a controller serving files there.
[17:07:20] <krismatrix> I think your statment "if you have a controller serving files there" is the part I am not following clearly. I am sure you are saying it correctly...but I am missing some understanding.
[17:08:01] <Botje> *something* inside your application is configured to serve static files when presented a URL that starts with /secure/images
[17:08:28] <Botje> or maybe /secure, or maybe there is something in front that tries to serve files before your other controllers get a chance.

[17:11:24] <Altreus> krismatrix: backend - the way it's configured and probably where that configuration is happening will determine what it serves
[17:12:08] <krismatrix> as far as i know...i have not done any configuration settings to access static files.

[21:26:00] <Altreus> Java is 90% workarounds of its own design
[21:26:05] <shaldannon> LOL
[21:26:41] <Altreus> Perl is 90% trying to get things to fail when they need to :D

[21:26:56] <xcombelle> .getThing() and .setThing() is quite ridiculous

[21:28:23] <Altreus> I wish I could understand Haskell, cos then I'd have a language that actually does things I wish languages did!
[21:28:28] <Altreus> But my brain won't go functional :(
[21:28:56] <Altreus> That's an interestingly short ada program!
[21:29:00] <ens> so i'm a noob to catalyst and i'm trying to get one row out of a database to pass to a template.
[21:29:06] <ens> my $thing = $c->model('ThingDB::Thing')->search({ id => $thing_id });
[21:29:19] <Altreus> is it a DBIx::Class model?
[21:29:22] <ens> yeah
[21:29:26] <Altreus> you want find, not search
[21:29:29] <Altreus> ->find( $thing_id )
[21:30:20] <ens> magic. that worked. thanks
[21:30:50] <Altreus> mind read ;)
[21:31:35] <ens> and to delete i just call ->delete() on the $thing right?

[21:47:50] <ens> and to complete the crud cycle. if i want to update fields in that $thing can i just set them and it will tie() through to the database or do i need to do another dbix::class model call?

[21:56:35] <ens> ah found it.. just call ->update({hash})
[21:59:56] <Altreus> that's right, or you can set them and call update later
[22:00:47] <ilmari> $thing->column($value); $thing->update()
