[12:37:42] <Carbonflux> the deception runs deep, its part of a larger aggregation of social engineering designed to make consciousness into a algorithm. 
[12:44:46] <MaNI> its infested everything though
[12:45:18] <MaNI> like the whole quantum computing lie as well ;) 
[12:47:51] <Carbonflux> ya, this idea of a qbit. its still digital.
[12:49:55] <Carbonflux> in a way i am happy about it, i really don't want corps to get their hands on actual machine consciousness because i think it will be just another form of slavery.
[12:52:05] <MaNI> bloody hell, why do the cpp standard people always copy boost but then stop 1 or 2 features short of actually being useful enough to replace the boost version? its infuriating
[12:53:09] <T`aZ> heh, not gonna comment, i dont like boost.
[12:53:39] <Carbonflux> it seems like in practice a lot of people see boost as part of the cpp standard.
[12:54:29] <MaNI> std::thread is clearly a copy of boost::thread, but lets not have "physical_concurrency()" because no that would be useful, lets just randomly leave that part out
[12:54:37] <Carbonflux> so the standards people figure everyone is using it anyway and whats a bit of bloat now days.
[12:55:44] <MaNI> they copied hardware_concurrency though but not physical_concurrency
[12:56:23] <Carbonflux> maybe there are meeting notes that explain their thinking.
[12:56:51] <MaNI> I'm sure there probably are
[12:57:15] <Carbonflux> it could be ego driven, they don't want to be seen as rubber stamping boost.
[12:57:52] <MaNI> doesn't make it any less infuriating, because I was attempting to remove all boost::thread from this codebase but now I must either still keep boost::thread or go on some dumb sidequest and add my own function for this to the codebase
