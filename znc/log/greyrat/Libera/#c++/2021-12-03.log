[16:10:11] <rah> is there a better way to treat an enum class variable as its underlying type, other than a reinterpret cast a la https://wandbox.org/permlink/21qCdgdf9YeBPcNj ?
[16:11:19] <PJBoy> static_cast of course
[16:11:49] <rah> PJBoy: that won't work
[16:11:59] <PJBoy> not when you need a reference, no
[16:12:12] <PJBoy> solution to that would be to not use a reference to an enum
[16:12:32] <rah> PJBoy: you're not helping me
[16:12:50] <Raziel> enums are very... static. very stiff, I would say. :p
[16:12:54] <PJBoy> well why *are* you trying to pass an enum as a reference to int?
[16:13:13] <PJBoy> making a reference to a primitive type is already not such a common pattern
[16:13:15] <Raziel> that is a pretty good question tbh
[16:13:18] <rah> it sounds like, no, there's no better way than a reinterpret cast
[16:13:22] <PJBoy> never mind aliasing its type
[16:13:28] <Raziel> rah, generally, yeah, that's correct
[16:14:04] <PJBoy> well making a temporary uint32_t and binding the reference to that would be better in some respect
[16:14:27] <PJBoy> I'm not sure that reinterpret_casting an enum to its underlying type is well defined
[16:14:56] <PJBoy> but if you do go the reinterpret_cast route, you can save yourself some tokens by writing `f(reinterpret_cast<uint32_t&>(e));`
[16:15:51] <PJBoy> although the original expression looks more like a hack, which is probably a good thing

[17:06:20] <RandomReader> they don't seem to be considered pointer-interconvertible, enums are only layout-compatible with other enums (not their underlying types)
[17:06:42] *** Joins: GNUmoon (~GNUmoon@gateway/tor-sasl/gnumoon)
[17:07:18] <RandomReader> since the alignment requirements are the same, we're left with an unchanged pointer value (meaning the only real option is to convert it back), and no aliasing rule that would allow access to be valid

[17:09:02] <RandomReader> it's interesting because it seems like "underlying type" would have more intent than that, but I can't find anything that even declares the representation to be the same
[17:10:04] <PJBoy> makes sense that enums shouldn't alias with non-enums
[17:10:17] <PJBoy> from a type based alias optimisation perspective
[17:15:10] <rah> "it works in practice but does it work in theory?"
[17:15:36] <PJBoy> it's subject to break with high levels of optimisation
[17:15:59] <rah> *gasp*
[17:16:01] <rah> oh noes!
[17:16:25] <RandomReader> "in practice" is going to be implementation dependent, some may make specific guarantees, but I don't think your particular scenario is covered by the common ones
[17:16:42] <RandomReader> (as in, it may not work as intended)
[17:16:43] <PJBoy> lots of stuff I've assumed compilers will be pragmatic about have been slowly disproved to me over the years
[17:16:45] <PJBoy> usually by clang
[17:17:29] <rah> RandomReader: it works as intended
[17:17:51] <RandomReader> when I say "may not", I mean it's subject to arbitrary change, even if you don't do anything
[17:18:06] <RandomReader> unless of course your particular implementation guarantees it in some form

[17:18:27] <RandomReader> C++ isn't a language where you can try something and then assume the behavior you observe will always hold
[17:18:47] <RandomReader> (well, most languages aren't, but C++ seems to surprise people that way more than others)
[17:19:04] <rah> fascinating, tell me more about this programming language I've been using for 20 years
[17:21:28] <riv> why dont you just do this uint32_t *ep = (uint32_t*)&e; f(*ep);
[17:22:15] <RandomReader> the same issue applies
[17:22:37] <PJBoy> yeah that's the same thing with an extra declaration
[17:22:57] <riv> what issue?
[17:23:05] <PJBoy> aliasing issue

[17:24:02] <RandomReader> in a lot of cases in C++, that means the result is undefined
[17:24:08] <RandomReader> the aliasing rule is one of those
[17:24:10] <riv> i dont even know c++ lol
[17:24:25] <RandomReader> aliasing applies to C as well, but I don't know about the particular enum/integer handling there

[23:28:28] <joomla5> What is A here?
[23:29:44] <pinchartl> it's a type alias, similar with what you would get with typedef
[23:30:06] <pinchartl> in this case it will be a pointer to a member function of class C taking D as a parameter and returning a const B*

[23:30:17] <geordi> pointer to member function of class S taking an integer and returning a pointer to a constant string
[23:31:17] <PJBoy> hm, in retrospect should've just used structs for every type
[23:31:18] <joomla5> so `C::*` here means any member function of class C ?
[23:31:31] <PJBoy> << TYPE_DESC<A>; struct B; struct C; struct D; using A = const B* (C::*)(D);
[23:31:32] <geordi> pointer to member function of class C taking a D and returning a pointer to a constant B
[23:32:11] <PJBoy> `R (C::*)(Args...)` is the general pointer to member function syntax
[23:32:20] <PJBoy> with return type R and parameter types Args...
[23:32:30] <PJBoy> comes as a whole package
[23:32:35] <RandomReader> `C::*` specifically means "member of class C", the rest of it determines whether it's a pointer-to-data-member or pointer-to-member-function

[23:35:16] <joomla5> Thank you. I really wish C++ wasn't so bloated, if I have to google what some syntax means the language has gone too far. How do C++ coders keep track of all the syntax? C is doen''t have this issue (or not as much)
[23:35:19] <RandomReader> the resulting location you store in such a thing is sort of incomplete: it describes a particular member of that type, but not for any particular *object* .. so when using the pointer, you can apply it to any object of that type

[23:36:55] <PJBoy> pointers to members don't come up that much
[23:37:13] <Raziel> also, usually not naming your types and/or functions A, B, C, D helps with seeing what's actually going on
[23:37:22] <Raziel> just sayin :p
[23:37:50] <Raziel> but yeah, that would not be something you see often anyway
[23:37:55] <RandomReader> pointer-to-member-functions are useful for callback-style work, but since C++11 there is std::function and lambda expressions, which are often used as an easier and more generalized option
[23:38:07] <RandomReader> easier to read, at least
[23:38:17] <joomla5> This is also nothing compared to templates, oh god how I hat them, take a look at this for exmaple `template <template <typename>  class T>` , I know these are `template template parameters` but why would some one be ok with adding this stuff to a language. It's powerful yes but at what cost
[23:38:22] <PJBoy> hoping they make a resurgence with the ranges algorithms
[23:38:41] <RandomReader> as for the language, C++ has different goals from most others .. it's something you have to accept going in, and I strongly recommend using structured learning material

[23:39:00] <PJBoy> template template parameters also don't up much
[23:39:19] <PJBoy> *don't come up
[23:39:27] <RandomReader> it's not intended to be a simple or lightweight language, which is .. sort of .. been C's goal

[23:40:18] <PJBoy> C++ is explicitly complex, but C is deceptively complex
[23:40:39] <RandomReader> C's complexity mostly comes in the form of behavior
[23:41:18] <joomla5> the issue is with syntax, when you add too much of it ,it become annoying to a developer who doesn't use it as much, I rather think about the logic of a program rather figure out what the syntax means.
[23:41:41] <RandomReader> personally I find C++ fun, it provides a toolset like no other, the ability to form abstractions suited to the problem space, and allows for solid and consistent behavior
[23:41:55] <joomla5> honestly reading assumably is much easer then reading C++ code at times.
[23:41:57] <Raziel> the syntax is something you learn and/or get used to over time
[23:41:58] <RandomReader> but like every other language it has particular uses
[23:42:07] <Raziel> if I try to write rust right now, I'll have to google syntax shit every 5 seconds
[23:42:13] <PJBoy> there's nothing you can do about pointer to members without pointer to member syntax
[23:42:17] <Raziel> even though its syntax is hardly rocket science
[23:42:28] <PJBoy> and they're nothing you can do about template template parameters without the syntax
[23:43:22] <PJBoy> you can't logic an alternative to those features
[23:43:29] <RandomReader> there aren't all that many languages that work as "sometimes" for developers .. that's more of a social/organization problem than a language one

[23:43:51] <SuperNintendoSUX> o_O
[23:44:59] <PJBoy> now something like having both struct and class
[23:45:07] <PJBoy> that would be a valid complaint about redundant syntax
[23:45:19] <RandomReader> some languages are more optimized for rapid learning, so you can at least get back up to speed a little quicker .. but fundamentally it's the same kind of problem for all of them, humans only have so much capacity and it's temporal :)
[23:45:30] <SuperNintendoSUX> what kills C++ is the C legacy
[23:45:43] <SuperNintendoSUX> I really long for a C++ w/o C
[23:45:43] <PJBoy> but compared to C#, we're pretty minimalistic on syntax
[23:45:48] <joomla5> maybe they should have stopped adding feature to it, feel like it all started going downhill after c++11. they are including the syntax of every other language lol.
[23:46:15] <PJBoy> interfaces, abstract classes, partial classes, delegates, all that stuff; all that stuff is just class in C++
[23:46:45] <PJBoy> well template template parameters and pointer to members came from C++98

[23:50:36] <joomla5> 0b is compiler thing, it's even there in C. I just use C when possible, which is almost always, the whole object oriented way of coding, public, privates, protected, abstracts, virtual functions, templates, lambdas, different type of initializers, const and consexprsion, too much, just too much
[23:51:28] <RandomReader> C has had 0b for a long time, C++ never did
[23:51:36] <joomla5> oh really? didn;t know
[23:51:57] <PJBoy> sounds like you don't like C++98
[23:53:09] <RandomReader> "the whole object oriented way of coding" tells me you haven't taken the time to learn C++ yet
[23:53:52] <RandomReader> it's only slightly more OO than C is, at a language level
[23:53:58] <PJBoy> I won't deny that it takes longer to learn the useful subset of C++ than the useful subset of C
[23:54:22] <RandomReader> it provides tools for organizing your code in OOP form, but also provides tools for several other ways, and isn't terribly opinionated about any of them
[23:55:12] <joomla5> I did. C++, java and some of the new ones. But If have to write anything from scratch its always C. A lot less tools within the language but it's simple. sorry for ranting by the way :)
[23:55:14] <RandomReader> all of the talk about C++ being OOP seems to come from over-eager people stuck in the 90s, when that was the Great New Thing, and those selling badly written books

[23:57:30] <RandomReader> coming from C, I mostly appreciate C++'s ability to build better abstractions, the real custom type system .. it genuinely creates more directly expressive, easier to reason about code for me
