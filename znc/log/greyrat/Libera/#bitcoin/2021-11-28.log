[05:36:28] <s17> bitcoin forum is the best forum
[05:36:29] <s17> amirite
[05:36:48] <killblockstream> there are my forums
[05:36:58] <s17> nah,
[05:37:23] <s17> The "Three Worlds" of the Cold War era, April â€“ August 1975
[05:37:34] <s17> ok, I was wrong about ww2
[05:37:55] <killblockstream> this is spam ^
[05:38:08] <killblockstream> talking about ww2
[05:39:01] <killblockstream> <s17> nah
[05:39:12] <killblockstream> what you mean with "nah"?
[05:39:19] <s17> I was wondering about the pricing model of bitcoin forum
[05:39:31] <s17> are there cheaper bitcoin forums than bitcoin forum?
[05:39:38] <killblockstream> it's free
[05:39:43] <s17> oh wow
[05:39:54] <s17> is it like wikipedia?
[05:40:06] <killblockstream> those prices are for companies or scammers who want to try they luck against an Artificial Intelligence
[05:41:08] <killblockstream> s17 on the Bitcoin Forum if you have at least Member level, you can create Wikis that others can edit.
[05:41:39] <s17> is Member level free?
[05:41:43] <s17> I haven't really researched
[05:41:44] <killblockstream> yes
[05:41:48] <s17> oh nice
[05:41:50] <killblockstream> of course is free
[05:41:54] <killblockstream> everything is free
[05:41:56] <s17> anyone can make a wiki
[05:42:01] <s17> that's amazing
[05:42:07] <killblockstream> yes
[05:42:27] <s17> so, can I make a page about ... Thor
[05:42:35] <killblockstream> about who?
[05:42:40] <s17> and call him the greatest thing since sliced Bitcoin??
[05:42:51] <s17> Halversson Mendoza?

[15:33:55] <xHire> Hi! I have a curious question: is the difficulty field actually needed in the Bitcoin block header? A colleague of mine asked me and I didnâ€™t really find a good answer. It can be computed easily, so why is it there? I could validate PoW of an individual block without the rest of the chain, yes, but is that actually useful since I canâ€™t validate the contents without the rest of the chain? Or what do I miss here?
