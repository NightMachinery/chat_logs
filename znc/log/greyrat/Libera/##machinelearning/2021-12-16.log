[21:01:27] <segaipad> GPU hardware question: How can I be sure if the machine learning application I am using will get the max out of my gpu? Does using PCIE x1 with a riser to a 3090 peform less well than a 3090 plugged into a PCIE 16x slot? If mixing a 24gb 3090 with another nvidia card with less RAM like a 3080 will the machine learning application utilize max ram from each card or will there be an overall performance decrease? I would like to know how to answer 
[21:01:28] <segaipad> these questions more generally but the specifc application I am using is styleGAN2-ada-pytorch.
