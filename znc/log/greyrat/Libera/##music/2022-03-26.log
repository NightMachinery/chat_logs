[02:01:39] <artao> do the parenthesis mean there's multiple questions that are correct?
[02:01:49] <Janet> Not a bot
[02:01:55] <louipc> yes

[02:02:57] <DOMF> oh man I tried a markov chain AI plugin thing once
[02:03:02] <DOMF> didn't go well
[02:03:05] <DOMF> was way more annoying than fun
[02:03:07] <louipc> why not
[02:03:07] <artao> why is LISP so good for AI programming and such?
[02:03:11] <artao> it sure is fucking hard to read
[02:03:21] <DOMF> I refuse to ever learn any lisp
[02:03:27] <DOMF> lisp was my father's language
[02:03:31] <artao> lol
[02:03:42] <artao> pascal then
[02:03:48] <DOMF> (and he was a fuck)
[02:03:52] <artao> iirc there's an objective pascal these days
[02:03:57] <artao> which is crazy talk
[02:03:58] <artao> lol
[02:03:58] <louipc> because its functional
[02:04:11] <DOMF> really, I just know some python and most of what I know is from fixing the bot lol
[02:04:18] <DOMF> (unless you count bash)
[02:04:27] <artao> in all my years of trying i've learned i'm not a programmer
[02:04:29] <louipc> not really
[02:04:40] <artao> i can do BASIC and some python
[02:04:40] <louipc> unless you can write a webserver in bash or something
[02:04:52] <artao> i've done a little pascal but don't remember it

[02:12:49] <DOMF> great farmers market in hilo too
[02:12:53] <morlog> there are several beaches that you can only get to on foot or boat that I'm planning on going to
[02:12:58] <DOMF> hella good produce for hella cheap
[02:12:59] <DOMF> nice
[02:13:00] <artao> Many helicopters these days have a radar dome mounted above the collective (the propellers). They can hover and hide behind a hill or ridge and just pop the radar up over it, then go back down and launch a bunch of guided missiles at the detected targets such as tanks.  They just stay below the ridge until the timer is like 5 sec before impact then pop the radar dome back up, which then updates the guidance on the missiles. Fucking crazy 
[02:13:00] <artao> tech. Hellfire missiles.
[02:13:15] <DOMF> you're probably still at the tail end of whale season too
[02:13:18] <DOMF> so if you CAN 
[02:13:23] <DOMF> get over closer to Maui
[02:13:25] <artao> oh wow. i didn't know there's a character limit
[02:13:28] <artao> huh
[02:13:46] <artao> Maui? wowie
[02:13:49] <artao> heh heh
[02:14:19] <artao> i considered getting a maui wowie delta-10 cart when i was at the store, but went with gorilla glue instead

[02:14:58] <artao> run out of resources very quickly
[02:15:00] <louipc> why
[02:15:08] <artao> hawaii has to have everything imported
[02:15:10] <louipc> havent ppl lived there for centuries
[02:15:21] <artao> it's not self-sustainable given its populaton
[02:15:26] <morf> i dunno how sustainable it would be
[02:15:30] <louipc> so just kill a bunch of ppl
[02:15:33] <louipc> problem solved
[02:15:34] <morf> but far from radioactivity 
[02:15:38] <morf> and viruses
[02:15:41] <LibertyDillo> The natives lived there for millennia 
[02:15:43] <artao> why do people live in stupid places? wtf people
[02:15:46] <artao> lol
[02:16:02] <louipc> what's hawaii's IQ?
[02:16:05] <morf> not sure how much it would help with full nuclear exchange 
[02:16:19] <morf> i would like to go to polynesia some day 
[02:16:34] <louipc> go next tuesday
[02:16:44] <morf> :|
[02:16:46] <louipc> then u and morlog can ride around like bandits
[02:16:48] <morf> ok
[02:16:56] <morf> let me check how long that will take
[02:17:01] *** Joins: voltage_ (voltage@user/voltage)
[02:17:07] <louipc> 24 hrs
[02:17:27] <artao> <louipc> so just kill a bunch of ppl
[02:17:38] <artao> well ..... that would happen all on its own once the food ran out
[02:17:50] <louipc> good. then that's solved
[02:18:04] <artao> followed by the cannibalism
[02:18:17] <artao> that happened several times in the Pacific islands
[02:18:25] <morf> Sorry, we could not calculate walking directions from "Prague" to "Tahiti, French Polynesia"
[02:18:26] <morf> oh yeah
[02:18:31] <artao> fucking stupid place to live. tiny islands out in the middle of the fucking ocean
[02:18:32] <morf> i was hoping they could :]
[02:18:35] <artao> wtf
[02:18:41] <louipc> you need swimming directions
[02:18:43] <artao> and the desert. why? get out of there ffs
[02:18:45] <artao> jesus
[02:18:46] <morf> it's just walking to like china 
[02:18:53] <morf> then swiming like 5000 km or so 
[02:19:00] <louipc> the ocean is rich man
[02:19:01] <morf> i think i could be there in like .. 
[02:19:04] <louipc> desert i dunno
[02:19:11] <artao> all them pacific islanders sure did have pretty advanced astrogation tho
[02:19:13] <morf> next century sharp 
[02:19:15] <morf> for sure
[02:19:16] <morf> :]
[02:19:34] <artao> GOD can you imagine the clear crisp night sky out in the middle of the ocean?
[02:19:38] <artao> all lights off
[02:19:44] <artao> that would be stunning
[02:19:56] <louipc> yes
[02:20:22] <artao> we can get some pretty damn nice skies here, but there's horizon light pollution in every direction
[02:20:38] <artao> but like 40 degrees to zenith can be pretty sweet
[02:20:38] <morf> yeah well everywhere
[02:20:55] <morf> i was living out of the city in small village and still there was way too many light pollution 
[02:21:02] <morf> even with telescope 
[02:21:11] <artao> DEEP forest can be quite sweet too. Like the Quetico Provincial Park on the border with NE Minnesota
[02:21:29] <artao> you can see quite with a telescope from within a city
[02:21:40] <artao> the moon for instance. eternally fascinating
[02:21:55] <artao> even just at low magnification like 25x
[02:22:02] <artao> at 300x? it's like you're there
[02:22:18] <louipc> i am there
[02:22:21] <morf> hm 40C in french polynesia 
[02:22:31] <artao> and humid i bet
[02:22:40] <louipc> dats hawt
[02:22:43] <morf> only 63%
[02:22:45] <morf> that's dry 
[02:22:55] <artao> oh. well that's not bad then
[02:23:02] <artao> that's like what? 95F ish?
[02:23:05] * artao checks

[02:23:21] <artao> okay
[02:23:24] <artao> that's fucking hot
[02:23:27] <artao> lol
[02:23:39] <artao> at least it's not bad humididiidity
[02:24:37] <louipc> humididdly
[02:24:44] <morf> weird it's literally an island in middle of an ocean
[02:24:58] <louipc> yep
[02:25:06] <artao> hawaii? yeah
[02:25:08] <artao> crazy eh
[02:25:31] <artao> from one angle looking at the earth it's almost entirely pacific ocean
[02:25:44] <artao> australia and n. america on the horizon

[02:27:21] <artao> i haven't, no
[02:27:51] <artao> but i've been in the middle of Lake Superior which is very similar in that you can see nothing but water in all directions
[02:27:57] <artao> no land in sight
[02:28:14] <louipc> sweet

[02:28:55] <artao> yeah, it was awesome. 1 week up there. total wilderness
[02:28:58] <artao> lots of swamp
[02:29:07] <artao> timber wolves
[02:29:28] <artao> all the fresh water has tapeworm eggs in it, so you have to boil and filter all your water
[02:29:58] <morf> thanks for the picture
[02:30:15] <artao> copper mine shafts in some places ... literally, open shafts, who knows how deep but very deep, filled with water. no protection around them
[02:30:22] <artao> like 1m square openings
[02:30:31] <artao> lots of copper mining up there way back when
[02:30:41] <morf> maybe you should drink some of the cooper mine water 
[02:30:46] <morf> and everything would be fine 
[02:31:12] <artao> yeah
[02:31:16] <artao> it was very very cold
[02:31:20] <artao> and just ... black
[02:31:44] <artao> i mean .. the water was perfectly clear. but looking into it it was just blackness
[02:32:33] <artao> floating bogs too, which was neato. the ground moves in waves while you're walking on it
[02:33:05] <artao> terrified that the ground underneath you will open up and swallow you, trapping you underwater in peat-filled swamp water
[02:34:05] * morf cursed aloud 
[02:34:12] <morf> i don't think the chill pill worked
[02:34:23] <artao> in the Quetico the water is so pristine you can easily see 10 meters down, and it looks like 2 cuz of the optics
[02:34:28] <artao> OHO and here's the snow

[02:35:48] <morf> i don't know what i want anyway
[02:35:57] <artao> i don't generally like it either cuz it's more fuzzy-mind whereas sativa is more focussedable
