[19:06:25] <epilys> are you using unstable rust in your project?
[19:06:49] <ngoldbaum> i think you can have deps that use unstable but your crate doesn’t have to
[19:07:04] <ngoldbaum> you may need nightly though if they need nightly
[19:07:14] <epilys> don't think so, since you use one toolchain to compile your crate
[19:07:42] <epilys> If I have rust stable installed it won't download rust nightly just to compile a dependency for example
[19:08:03] <epilys> in fact toolchains (versions) are not even managed by cargo
[19:09:35] <companion_cube> you're supposed to use rustup I think
[19:11:47] <epilys> yeap

[19:26:27] <varjag> to be precise it's humility debugger in hubris os
[19:27:02] <varjag> i built and installed the os on a devboard the other day
[19:27:09] <varjag> but the debugger doesn't give in
[19:27:40] <varjag> it uses rustup i believe and rustc is sparkling new
[19:28:19] <epilys> install nightly using rustup and do cargo +nightly build instead of cargo build
[19:28:44] <varjag> cargo uses some vendor's extension to cross compile
[19:28:51] <varjag> would that still work with nightly?
[19:29:29] <epilys> no idea tbh
[19:29:37] <epilys> don't they have build documentation?
[19:29:38] <varjag> and i mean the official stable rustc is 1.56
[19:29:42] <varjag> i run on 1.57 already
[19:29:46] <varjag> how much a nightly gonna fix
[19:29:59] <ngoldbaum> there are features that are only present on nightly
[19:30:01] <varjag> yes they do have build documentation
[19:30:06] <varjag> accroding to it it should build
[19:30:07] <ngoldbaum> some features are permanently like tgat
[19:30:08] <epilys> basically the problem is you can't have  "feature"s in stable
[19:30:21] <varjag> mhm
[19:30:46] <ngoldbaum> but i’d expect them to tell you that explicitly in the build docs if it’s necessary
[19:30:58] <epilys> you can try beta/nightly but stable is just off the table
[19:31:06] <varjag> they explicitly tell to use rustup

[19:32:13] <epilys> I guess the problem is they don't mention that you have to use their toolchain to build the debugger
[19:32:21] <epilys> find its name by listing the toolchains with rustup
[19:32:26] <epilys> and then build the debugger with cargo +name
