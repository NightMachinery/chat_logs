[02:08:04] <biys> i would say given my literature class
[02:08:32] <biys> it would appear that regardless what is actually said, discourse is not actually appreciated
[02:09:42] <biys> we're reading this book called Tuesday with Morrie.  Morrie is a sociologist who's developed ALS.  Mitch Albom, who is now an established journo, is writing a book about the last months of Morrie's life.
[02:10:32] <biys> the instructor has seemed to significantly read into this book.  i can understand what they're saying completely, but it just isn't reasonable if it was developed in the real life
[02:10:45] <biys> he's almost suggesting that his class should become altruistic
[02:12:00] <biys> that the best way to operate in the world is by being altruistic.  he masquerades as having some kind of keen insight into how best navigate the earth and ones time living
[02:12:16] <Ungwelian> What a horrible notion :)
[02:12:21] <biys> and he constantly kind of makes these comments that seem to be completely outside the ralm of possibilities
[02:12:28] <apotheon> 22:38 < biys> it would appear that regardless what is actually said, discourse is not actually appreciated
[02:12:29] <biys> realm
[02:12:35] <apotheon> typical in school settings
[02:12:58] <biys> it's kind of weird though
[02:13:08] <biys> like... why suggest people to come out with ideas on text and literature
[02:13:23] <biys> then kind of become abrasive if it clashes with your world perspective
[02:13:34] <apotheon> because of cognitive dissonance
[02:13:50] <biys> fair enough
[02:14:04] <apotheon> time for a walk, for me
[02:14:28] <biys> i also laugh because these literature classes have a over-arching topic of divserity and inclusion, united nations style sustainable development, altruism, and the IDEA of thinking critically
[02:14:58] <biys> at one time i said, "the indoctrination you're prescribing right now is no different than any other indoctrination"

[02:16:20] <biys> and gave me the notes "you fail to show empathy"
[02:16:44] <Ungwelian> Empathy is an important quality to have.
[02:16:52] <Ungwelian> And it can be learned.
[02:16:52] <biys> empathy awsn't even in the ruberic
[02:17:47] <biys> sure, EQ

[02:18:45] <biys> makes me really think of what Gavin Mcinnes said though.  strong men make good times, good times make weak men, weak men make bad times, bad times make strong men
[02:19:10] <Ungwelian> Here, in Finland, the evaluation takes into consideration how you're processing the text, personally and also in the larger context.
[02:19:35] <Ungwelian> Showing empathy towards someone whose health is failing is part of that.
[02:20:12] <biys> there isn't a lack of empathy.  i'm completely aware of the situation.  it's perhaps that i'm not yelling at the moon and throwing myself on the ground
[02:20:36] <Ungwelian> You don't sound aware enough to show empathy.
[02:20:38] <apotheon> lack of the prof's empathy

[02:22:21] <Ungwelian> I'll be going to sleep as well.

[03:21:13] <apotheon> It does occasionally get a little frustrating when someone wants to redefine the whole glossary of philosophical terms then talk about things that no longer have words associated with them.

[03:28:52] <biys> apotheon: it's not so much any particular view or another of how one is to live within the world... it's more-so associated with the idea that people think they've found it, themselves
[03:29:36] <biys> and upon being questioned about the validity of it they tend to simply categorize you in some way or another in some disparaging way.
[03:29:56] <biys> they tell you "this is how you ought to live because it's the best way to live"
[03:30:16] <biys> then you ask them to elaborate and it's something like "well isn't it obvious this is truth i am speaking?"
[03:30:44] <biys> everyone fails to really be able to substantiate their idea one way or another with any kind of significan underpinning
[03:30:50] <biys> it's just the way they ``feel'' about it

[03:34:29] <biys> good chances are it's a duck
[03:35:07] <thunder> the golden rule is a positive assertion of reciprocity, but I find it poorly founded. I think rather than advocating that people foist their desires onto others, they should also be willing to take no for an answer. this is the biggest problem with abrahamic religions. the golden rule should be phrased more like "do NOT do to others, what THEY do not want done"
[03:35:32] <biys> hmmm
[03:36:14] <causative> you can see why that one isn't the one that caught on:  it's too subservient, people don't like being told to just do what other people want them to do
[03:36:29] <biys> hah
[03:36:33] <causative> or not do what they don't want them to do, which amounts to the same thing
[03:36:41] <thunder> it's simply about taking no for an answer. that's the fundamental basis of human rights.
[03:37:02] <causative> well say an employer doesn't want his employees to unionize
[03:37:11] <causative> what advice does your rule offer there?
[03:37:15] <thunder> property rights are the devil in the details.
[03:37:46] <thunder> it's contractual. but in making that contract/agreement (as to rights), one must have the ability to say "no" without reprisal.
[03:37:51] <thunder> otherwise there's no consent
[03:38:06] <causative> what if the other person doesn't want you to say no?
[03:38:12] <thunder> it's coercion
[03:38:17] <causative> then by saying no, you'd be doing unto them what they don't want done
[03:38:19] <causative> breaking your rule
[03:38:53] <thunder> yeah. you can twist it around like that if you want I guess. I see your point.
[03:39:29] <causative> or like if someone is in an abusive relationship and their abuser doesn't want them to leave, but they do anyway - that also breaks your rule
[03:39:29] <thunder> I don't use the golden rule or that rephrasing of it. I just say "dissent is custodian of consent"
[03:39:57] <causative> we generally regard that consent is only important for *certain* actions, not all
[03:40:03] <thunder> causative: self-ownership takes precedence
[03:40:15] <causative> e.g. a merchant does not have to get the consent of his competitor when he wants to lower his prices
[03:40:46] <causative> so your rule has to be full of unstated special cases and caveats
[03:41:07] *** Quits: plankster (~plankster@user/plankers) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[03:41:10] <thunder> true. I'll have to consider it in that light more carefully
[03:41:20] <causative> the golden rule has the appeal that it seems more "fair" - to break it seems like hypocrisy
[03:41:32] <thunder> in order to understand where and now I choose to draw that line in my decisions
[03:41:35] <causative> and less like just subservience
[03:42:01] <causative> it's similar to the categorical imperative:  live by the rules that you want others to apply to yourself
[03:42:21] <causative> both the golden rule and the CI are of course formally flawed
[03:42:52] <thunder> property rights are the devil in the details, but they're also a good place to begin understanding rights in general. I'm wouldn't advocate any particular conception of property above others (that's for the given society to decide), but I do believe self-ownership trumps any other.
[03:43:30] <causative> in practice, all ownership is based in force, including self-ownership
[03:43:43] <thunder> we use force to move our limbs. so yeah.
[03:43:45] <causative> you own what you have the force to defend, or have the ability to get others to apply force to defend

[03:44:03] *** Joins: W177 (~W177@137.220.8.178)
[03:44:09] <thunder> the corollary to "dissent is custodian of consent" is that "might is custodian of rights"
[03:44:18] <causative> and I say "defend" but this is a biased word here - you also own what you have the force to take aggressively
[03:44:22] <thunder> because rights are consent
[03:44:34] <causative> whether an action is "defense" or "aggressive seizure" depends on your point of view
[03:44:35] <thunder> and might is the means to defend them from those who refuse to take no for an answer
[03:45:00] <thunder> yes. that point of view becomes the cultural ethos surrounding property
[03:45:44] <thunder> whether or not they conceive of a thing called "property" in their minds, in effect that's still an accurate description of the idea
[03:47:12] <causative> something like the "original position" makes sense in combination with the golden rule:  imagine you were a designer of society, outside of it, and able to choose what rules you want everyone to live by. Live by those rules.
[03:47:46] <causative> the original position has the benefit of keeping you from choosing rules that benefit your personal demographic at the expense of others
[03:48:04] <causative> because you imagine yourself as someone outside society, with an abstract interest in societal well-being, not a personal one

[04:09:36] <causative> apotheon, I also said "<causative> whether an action is "defense" or "aggressive seizure" depends on your point of view"
[04:09:48] <apotheon> yeah
[04:10:04] <apotheon> a common approach to dismissing a particular normative stance
[04:10:09] <causative> my point here is not that it is right to aggressively seize property, but that exactly *what* is defense, and what is aggression, is a matter to be decided *After* we've decided on a system of property
[04:10:23] <causative> for example, police often seize private property, and banks do too
[04:10:29] <causative> is this aggression or defense?
[04:10:41] <apotheon> usually aggression, in the case of police
[04:10:48] <apotheon> banks . . . it gets complicated
[04:11:00] <apotheon> That's based on my take on ethics, of course.
[04:11:01] <causative> well, that's a matter of opinion, and whether you say it is aggression or defense depends already on an established notion of property
[04:11:06] <apotheon> You didn't specify some other standard.

[04:13:18] <apotheon> One can justify an opinion and still be wrong.  One can come to a conclusion through reason, and without further information to dispute it the obvious approach is not to just voice an opinion but accept the product of reason.

[04:33:34] <thunder> understand their respective concerns and make accomodations if that's sufficient. if not, the workers have a right to leave, or the boss to fire them as per their existing contract.

[04:35:04] <thunder> the normative role of contracts is to create clear obligations between parties backed by agreed consequences for violation.
[04:35:43] <thunder> if the violation is willful and ongoing, then typically (even in financial circumstances) the default resort is to might
[04:35:45] <apotheon> contracts without coercion, anyway
[04:36:14] <causative> thunder, so what you're saying is, it's okay to do unto others what they don't want done, as long as they're trying to do the same thing back to you?
[04:36:49] <thunder> if you do that to one person, you can expect they will reciprocate.
[04:36:50] <causative> i.e. the employees are allowed to unionize against the wishes of the employer, as long as the employer is doing noxious things to the employees in return, and they cannot reach an agreement?
[04:37:46] <thunder> employees usually try to unionize because of poor treatment, and the fact that unionization is licit within the legal system of the society.

[04:46:24] <apotheon> Precautionary forebearance from interfering with the moral self-determination of others is a good way to get yourself in hot water, morally, if there's some as-yet undetermined metaphysical moral standard.
[04:46:36] <apotheon> err, is a good way to avoid getting in hot water, that is
[04:47:20] <apotheon> The resulting principle is a right of self-determination.
[04:47:50] <causative> well apotheon I don't see what I would consider formal deduction here
[04:47:57] <causative> for example, you say:  " Coercion that interferes with practice of correct moral beliefs is clearly Evil"
[04:48:19] <causative> you're saying it's "clearly" true - and maybe it does seem so - but that's not a formal deduction
[04:48:20] <thunder> I think so too, but I question when that line is crossed. such as if I see two people engaged in violence, and one is shouting "no" or words to that effect, I feel it's incumbent on me to step in and try to help in some way, by use of force if necessary.
[04:48:31] <apotheon> causative: It's essentially a tautology.
[04:48:46] <apotheon> You don't need deduction to get to that sentence -- only definitions of terms.
[04:48:56] <causative> well, what is the definition of "correct moral beliefs" and "evil" ?
[04:49:26] <apotheon> If there are correct moral beliefs, the interference with them is an act of opposing good.
[04:49:34] <causative> you say, "Evil - That which is judged immoral, what should not be by the standards of a given system of morals, is called Evil."
[04:49:35] <apotheon> The opposition of that which is good is evil.
[04:49:38] <apotheon> Is that clearer?

[04:52:16] <apotheon> It's a definition.

[04:58:50] <apotheon> what would you call something that opposes good
[04:59:15] <apotheon> One can speak of the formal thing, without knowing the practical details of the thing, when the thing is a matter of definitions.
[04:59:44] <apotheon> Whether you are such a one is up to you, I guess.
[04:59:54] <causative> well - but this is not pure deduction, this is my subjective and natural language understanding of terms - someone who opposes good could be evil, or misinformed, or selfish, or operate according to a moral system that does not acknowledge the concept of good or evil
[04:59:58] <thunder> good and evil are a choice of perspective, usually having some kind of supernatural connotation
[05:00:21] <apotheon> Okay, let's clarify:
[05:00:29] <thunder> it stems from ahura mazda and ahriman tmk
[05:00:40] <apotheon> What do you call the *act of oppposing good*?
[05:00:59] <apotheon> I'm not talking about a person who does something that unknowingly happens to interfere with good.
[05:01:16] <causative> I don't think I have a specific word for that, I'd call it an act of opposing good
[05:01:19] <apotheon> (note that there *is* a distinction to be made between opposing good and merely interfering with good)
[05:01:33] <apotheon> . . . so you don't think anti-good is evil?
[05:02:00] <apotheon> Define "opposed" for me.
[05:02:08] <causative> apotheon> I'm not talking about a person who does something that unknowingly happens to interfere with good. <- I have a problem with this because I speculate that *all* evil acts are the result of ignorance
[05:02:12] <apotheon> I want to know what you're actually saying.
[05:02:41] <apotheon> So what?
[05:02:46] <apotheon> That doesn't change what I said.
[05:03:12] <apotheon> I'm actually saying "I'm not talking about whether the person is evil.  Look at the actual words, and apply them to the act."
[05:03:26] <causative> well you're asking me to do the impossible, then - to tell you how someone could oppose good without being ignorant.  But my position is that if someone opposes good they do so *because* of ignorance
[05:03:33] <apotheon> Your complaint about why people might interfere with good is irrelevant.
[05:03:56] <apotheon> No, I'm talking about an *act* opposing good.  I said so, more than once, in different ways.
[05:04:08] <apotheon> I'm not talking *at all* about a *person opposing good* per se.
[05:04:23] <apotheon> You must be reading a lot into my words -- a lot that isn't there.
[05:04:25] <causative> say that you need to get a driver's license to provide for your wife and children
[05:04:33] <apotheon> ogawd
[05:04:38] <apotheon> never mind
[05:04:43] <causative> and the clerk at the DMV denies your application for some problem with your documentation
[05:04:52] <apotheon> I'll just move on to something more interesting to do with my time.
[05:04:53] <causative> what you are trying to do is good, and the clerk is opposing you
[05:04:55] <causative> but is the clerk evil?
[05:05:02] <causative> is the clerk's act evil?
[05:05:04] <apotheon> IT'S NOT ABOUT THE FUCKING CLERK
[05:05:05] <apotheon> done here
[05:06:25] <causative> people cause harm to each other without being evil - accidental harm, bureaucratic harm, harm out of ignorance
[05:06:36] <causative> so I could not say that opposing good, or causing harm, must always be an act of evil

[05:12:48] <apotheon> Even when you refer to the act, you can't avoid depending on the person.  This would never get anywhere.
[05:13:36] <causative> here is what I say - my most fundamental, most well-justified moral position
[05:14:34] <causative> it's a bit meta.  First, we observe that we can sometimes be persuaded of moral views by reading moral arguments.
[05:15:00] <causative> if we study ethics, we might be persuaded first one way, then another, perhaps several times before we come upon our current set of beliefs
[05:15:34] <causative> I say that moral truth is what we would be persuaded of *eventually* - if we heard and understood and chewed over *every* possible moral argument
[05:15:56] <causative> the set of views after such a process is moral truth, and the behaviors we would choose to adopt after such a process would be the definition of good
[05:16:58] <causative> this is a special case of my general position regarding truth:  namely that the truth is the "limit of investigation," the view we would come to if we saw all the evidence and heard all the arguments

[05:19:16] <apotheon> The truth is that which is still true even when no one believes it.
[05:19:31] <causative> agreed
[05:21:22] <causative> keep in mind that the process of hearing and thinking about *every* possible argument, and *all* the evidence, is a hypothetical scenario that does not actually happen in physical reality
[05:21:39] <causative> it's not the same as what anyone believes or does not believe in the present
[05:22:16] <causative> the hypothetical scenario still yields the same set of hypothetical beliefs, regardless of what people in the present believe
[05:22:28] <causative> regardless also of whether there are any people in the present
[05:24:07] <apotheon> Well . . . one of us, at least, has learned something.
[05:24:13] <apotheon> I learned someething about what you believe.
[05:24:21] <apotheon> I guess I'll count that as a win.
[05:24:29] <apotheon> (for me; not of the argument)
[05:24:40] <apotheon> The argument is basically a non-starter.
[05:25:36] <causative> this position is closely related to pragmatism - though, whereas pragmatism focuses on a "community of inquirers," I am concerned with what an individual agent could be persuaded of in the limit of investigation. Accordingly, I call it "persuasionism."
[05:26:18] <causative> I see no need to assume a community - the question of truth would still be relevant to the last man on earth
[05:26:45] <causative> and additionally, I am concerned with truth and falsehood within the minds of artificial agents, which act usually as individuals

[05:34:52] <varde> I'm currently trying to design a working retina scanner/reader/writer for VR and have a logical question; there are 300 people on VR screen, if your eye moves left the tech processes that it's the left side of that 300. How do we progress this tech so it can select the exact 1 looked at?
[05:37:33] <bittersweetsymph> do a real life study the maths of where many real people's eyeballs sit when they are looking at an object same distance away and then by averaging you would have a best guess of what they are looking at without telling you but maybe it would have to do with how far away the glasses sit from the eye also
[05:38:27] <varde> The best idea I have is having multiple processes, eye moves left with X amount of weight and X amount of stopping power. Perhaps only peaceful games like second Life or metaverse can be played. In which case selecting between a party of 4 or strategically placed multitudes, shouldn't be hard

[05:54:12] <varde> We see 100 people in a line, the tech reads you looked left and also produces a frame that you write on in a quick moment (unseen; felt), which narrows it down another left/right/centre. Finally a on screen, thrown pointer that targets round about the current target area and you either agree or disagree and repeat the first two steps
[05:54:18] <varde> It can be done I think!!!
[05:54:36] <causative> varde, isn't eye tracking a solved problem?
[05:54:48] <varde> Not in virtual reality
[05:55:29] <causative> the left eye is going to be aimed at an element of the 2d image presented to the left eye, and same for the right eye
[05:55:41] <causative> if the eyes are working together it should be the same element
[05:56:17] <causative> so you can select that element
[05:56:43] <causative> by ray tracing
[05:56:52] <biys> varde: there's terms like uh...  focal points and nodal points
[05:57:09] <biys> with regards to shooting SLR for a 360 degree pano to make stitching work best
[05:57:17] <varde> A good thing about eyes is the ability to read if they agree/disagree in a phase 3 moment. Based on current info we make this target area and point at a random target, your eyes either focus on the pointer to confirm yes or look elsewhere.
[05:57:29] <biys> provided you aren't shooting dual lense with 180 degrees FOV each
[05:57:35] <biys> which is what a lot of off the market cameras do
[05:58:12] <causative> can't you just look at the position of the pupils
[05:58:28] <causative> if you have a camera looking at each eye
[05:58:42] <varde> Yeah but that's tricky
[05:58:49] <causative> why
[05:58:54] <biys> would depth not be a problem?
[05:58:59] <causative> isn't that what existing eye trackers do?
[05:59:18] <causative> don't need to worry about depth since each eye is looking at a 2d screen
[05:59:27] <causative> just see where it's looking on that screen
[05:59:34] <biys> so we're just determining roughly where the eye is looking not at what?
[05:59:58] <causative> you can then ray trace into the 3d rendered scene

[13:39:10] <blkshp> faith
[13:39:47] <varde> Yes, literally
[13:40:23] <varde> Faith is the unending canteen
[13:40:47] <blkshp> You saying canteen has made me want a cheap fried breakfast.
[13:40:54] <varde> Hahaha
[13:42:21] <arryana> you saying fried breakfast reminded me that my grocery delivery is late
[13:42:24] <arryana> ta
[13:43:22] <pussipupu> ooh, thanks
[13:43:41] <pussipupu> I might drink a real tea actually
[13:43:44] <causative> well, someone might cross a rickety foot-bridge and we'd say they have "blind faith" it will support their weight
[13:43:49] <mnemon> varde: the difference between a guess and an educated guess
[13:44:01] <blkshp> ^^ i like that
[13:44:11] <causative> but if they understood the engineering of the bridge, and that it was sound, then we might say they have well-placed faith that it will support their weight
[13:44:32] <causative> of course, some wouldn't call well-placed faith, faith at all
[13:44:35] <causative> because it's justified
[13:48:51] <causative> in a philosophical or religious context, faith by definition is not rationally justified
[13:49:22] <varde> Blind faith is definitely an error.
[13:49:32] <causative> but the word can be used in other ways as well, as just a synonym for confidence
[13:50:27] *** Joins: slikislik (uid190389@id-190389.hampstead.irccloud.com)
[13:50:39] <varde> I think it's not confidence directly and thus is a similar not a same
[13:51:02] <varde> Confidence seems to come from without while faith, within.
[13:51:27] <varde> Without fear; within... (I don't know yet).
[13:52:15] <causative> religious faith comes from being indoctrinated into unjustified nonsense from early childhood and told to just trust authority, not think critically
[13:52:41] <causative> with an element of wishful thinking too, believing what you wish would be true
[13:53:13] <varde> One could consider religious faith as blind faith because they trust a book of blind faith guesswork, non-scientific
[13:53:47] <causative> because of the religious association I would say the word "faith" is tainted in a philosophical context, and we should use the more neutral words "belief" or "confidence"
[13:53:49] <varde> Fool's faith ateotd
[13:54:05] <varde> Not true faith lol
[13:54:21] <mnemon> causative: religions tend to have their own logic, question of axioms rather than "lack of sense" as such

[13:55:29] <I_Am_M00t> amen
[13:55:50] <causative> often the dogma is very self-contradictory
[13:56:16] <causative> as we would expect from a body of work by many different authors, interpreted in many different ways over centuries
