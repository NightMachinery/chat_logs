[03:14:23] <Klinda> I add this file to my notebook

[03:14:33] <mdogg> Oh.  Ok.
[03:14:44] <Klinda> If I stil not do it the first one?

[03:15:00] <Klinda> ?
[03:15:07] <mdogg> "I am adding this memo to the database."  Or, "I am going to add this memo to the database."
[03:15:45] <Klinda> I add this memo to the database
[03:15:49] <Klinda> what's the sense of it?
[03:16:06] <mdogg> No, that doesn't make sense.  In that case you would say, "I added this memo to the database." 
[03:16:41] <mdogg> Or "I have added this memo to the database."  <-- that would be more correct..
[03:17:03] <Klinda> when a phrase is correct with only add?
[03:17:09] <mdogg> "I am going to add this memo...."  "I will add this memo..."  
[03:17:31] <mdogg> "If you add this memo to the database, you are going to upset the management team."
[03:18:43] <Klinda> so on github when you add a file and you do the commit, what comment is correct to add ? "Added file.py" ? 
[03:18:45] <mdogg> You should be able to replace the word 'add' with 'include'.
[03:19:18] <mdogg> Does that make sense?
[03:20:07] <Klinda> yes
[03:20:21] <Klinda> I mean I was in doubt between add and added

[03:44:44] <kurahaupo> (most IRC channels ask the opposite: please paste the text of any error message into the channel, rather than a screen shot", because almost always a screen shot is a an image that we need to go fetch to view, 
[03:45:06] <melodie> <Klinda> so on github when you add a file and you do the commit, what comment is correct to add ? "Added file.py" ?  // usually they say "I commited file.py to... "
[03:45:06] <kurahaupo> and which is illegible on the wrong device)

[03:47:04] <LjL> Klinda: sometimes "Add blah to blah" is used in things like commit messages, but it's not otherwise a standard construction (unless you mean it as an imperative)
[03:47:34] <LjL> To your question as to when the present "add" is used, you can say things like "I always add a comment whenever I write complex code"
[03:48:00] <LjL> "I often add an attachment to my emails"
[03:48:36] <LjL> The simple present normally pertains to the frequency you do things
[03:48:47] <LjL> "I never add my own opinion to facts."
[03:49:55] <LjL> If you're going to add something in the future, you can say, as suggested, "I am going to add" or "I will add". Sometimes even "I am adding", although that's more often used for something you're doing right now. They are similar but different

[04:03:53] <TimMc> Agreed, you generally want to use the imperative for the first line of a commit message.
[04:04:51] <LjL> TimMc, is it really the imperative, though? i mean it makes no difference in practice, but i always kind of wondered, *is* it the imperative that's being used there? or is it really some subtler thing that's not on my radar
[04:05:15] <LjL> you can use the imperative for to-do notes, but then those are things you are telling yourself to do in the future. commit messages explain what you've already done
[04:05:18] <TimMc> Oh, I don't know if there's some more precise grammatical term for it.
[04:05:30] <LjL> it doesn't doesn't quite feel like the same thing to me
[04:05:46] <TimMc> It could be an elision of some sort instead.
[04:05:55] <LjL> if someone know what the imperative is and how to use it, saying it's the imperative is "good enough", as practically it's indistinguishable
[04:05:58] <TimMc> "[The purpose of this commit is to] add file.py"
[04:06:02] <LjL> hmm
[04:06:21] <TimMc> So there it would be infinitive, without the "to".
[04:06:50] <TimMc> Are there any words where the infinitive and imperative differ (other than the "to")?
[04:07:03] <TimMc> If so, perhaps then we could decide which it is. :-)
[04:07:11] <LjL> don't think so
[04:07:51] <TimMc> What about do-support and negation?
[04:08:10] <TimMc> "Don't return X" -- that sure looks like imperative
[04:08:22] <LjL> yep
[04:08:28] <TimMc> otherwise it would be "[to] not return X"
[04:08:33] <LjL> correct
[04:09:07] <LjL> i guess imperative is the most parsimonious explanation
[04:09:26] <LjL> what does it arise from, though? why are we pretending we're telling the computer to do the stuff we've just done? :P
[04:09:53] <LjL> i think it may stem from the style in to-do lists after all
[04:09:58] <LjL> even though it's no longer a to-do
[04:10:04] <TimMc> Could just be convention that arises from wanting a short message.
[04:10:37] <TimMc> (although that feels like a weak explanation to me)
[04:10:46] <LjL> well, you could do things like "X not returned [anymore]"
[04:10:58] <LjL> the past participle would be more appropriate in some other languages
[04:11:15] <TimMc> I'm not sure how you get from todo list to git commits, but I see the parallel.
[04:11:17] <LjL> which i guess is partly why Klinda asked ;)
[04:11:34] <LjL> TimMc, well before being commits they may have had entries on a to-commit list :P
[04:11:38] <LjL> have been
[04:11:46] <TimMc> Oh! And just pasted in. :-)
[04:11:48] *** Quits: Maxdamantus (~Maxdamant@user/maxdamantus) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[04:11:50] <TimMc> I like it.
[04:12:34] <TimMc> It's also possible that it started as an elision ("[changed to] add X feature") and things like "Don't return X" are a backformation.
[04:13:06] <LjL> feature requests and bug reports are also often expressed in the imperative (including "Don't ..." for bug reports)
[04:13:17] <LjL> so the commit that implements those requests just mirrors them
[04:13:20] <TimMc> true
[04:14:21] <LjL> i find the elision explanation not too convincing because there would be some less awkward ways. "Adds feature X". it's a commit. it adds the feature. easy.
[04:14:48] <TimMc> Relatedly, something that drives me nuts is when changelogs use a mix of "X explodes when Y" and "Make sure X works when Y" in their fixed-bugs section.
[04:15:00] <LjL> hehe
[04:15:07] <TimMc> The first is clearly copied from a bug report, rather than a todo list...
[04:15:12] <LjL> "X explodes when Y [now fixed]" would help :P
[04:15:25] <TimMc> Sometimes I see it with "Fixed: " as a prefix.
[04:15:44] <LjL> TimMc, well, but then at least you see, we have concrete example of things being copypasted from reports/requests, so my theory has precedent ;)
[04:15:48] <TimMc> yup

[09:53:17] <skyfall> Should I need to write "and" there?
[09:53:34] <skyfall> (foobar, A, B, C and D are placeholders) 
[09:53:48] <papna> skyfall: The latter sounds more like, "as opposed to D"
[09:54:05] <papna> Do you have a concrete example?
[09:54:27] <enrou> amigojapan: so my context makes sense, right? I don't need to change it to "it is a job that require time consuming"
[09:55:42] <skyfall> papna: The closest example I could think of is: The idea of being an engineer was intellectual, analytical, technical, and not racial. 
[09:55:43] <amigojapan> enrou: I did not see the beginning of the conversation, but what you just said would be worng "it is a time consumming job"
[09:56:10] <skyfall> In this case, you're saying removing "and" is better, right?
[09:56:30] <enrou> <enrou> if there is a job or post that take a lot of effort and time. Can we say "It is a time-consuming job"? or should be something else?

[09:57:11] <papna> skyfall: I don't think the sentence is very clear overall. The idea of being an engineer isn't technical. Engineers have technical skills. Many parts of the sentence do not parallel each other.
[09:57:21] <papna> skyfall: But probably "A, B, and C, not D"
[09:57:35] <skyfall> Ok, I will remove "and". Thanks.
[09:59:00] <enrou> amigojapan: and I think it is consuming not consumming (I think you mistype it)
[09:59:43] <amigojapan> yeah, probably, I am nto good at spelling

[21:23:14] <sapzaiwa> Is this sentence correct and natural?   As many as 16 individuals were sentenced to prison after illegally obtained funds were laundered through the construction of stores.
[21:24:12] <twb> "As many as" looks awful
[21:24:25] <twb> Find out the actual number
[21:25:02] <sapzaiwa> Doesn't "as many as 16" work?
[21:25:05] <twb> "through the construction of stores" is a little bit hard to parse.  I would say something more like "laundred through the retail construction industry"
[21:25:32] <twb> sapzaiwa: it's a well-formed sentence, but when I read it, I go "OK so: 0 people"
[21:25:55] <sapzaiwa> ?
[21:26:01] <sapzaiwa> It  says 16 individuals
[21:26:06] <sapzaiwa> Can you say "...laundered by constructing stores"?
[21:26:09] <twb> Because "as many as 16" means "a number between 0 and 16"
[21:26:14] <sapzaiwa> Oh
[21:26:25] <twb> So obviously it's going to be 0 and you are using weasel words

[21:26:53] <twb> "Up to 5000 US presidents were convicted for genocide"

[21:34:57] <sapzaiwa> In 2021, sixteen individuals were sentenced to prison after illegally obtained funds were laundered by constructing stores.
[21:35:32] <twb> Were they sentenced *for* laundering money?
[21:35:45] <twb> Or were they sentenced for parking tickets, and the two incidents are completely unrelated?
[21:35:49] <TimMc> "As many as 16" might convey uncertainty; some sources reporting as few as 5 (or 0) and some as many as 16.
[21:36:06] <twb> TimMc: right, it LITERALLY denotes an upper bound

[21:41:40] <twb> huf: yep
[21:42:01] <TimMc> haha
[21:42:11] <twb> You say "as many as" because you don't actually have a body count yet.  Maybe 50 of that 300 just ran away and are still hiding
[21:42:46] <twb> Sentencing is usually a public document, so using it there indicates the journalist is either 1) lazy; or 2) lying
[21:42:59] <twb> In American, it's called a "police blotter"
[21:44:12] <TimMc> Yeah, I think it would be most correctly used to describe either a high water mark (including literally: "the waves reached as high as the dunes") or uncertainty ("as many as 30 schools may have been affected by the frog plague" when you know that many schools were in the area and know that at least some were affected, but don't have the full count yet)

[22:41:55] <bin> not without context
[22:42:04] <sapzaiwa> true
[22:42:33] <sapzaiwa> Sixteen individuals were sentenced to prison on anti-mafia charges.
[22:44:30] <papna> I can't imagine what an anti-mafia charge would be. Can you explain?

[22:47:49] <papna> Oh, as in crimes that were made into law as anti-mafia measures.

[22:48:38] <papna> I think "mafia", "racketeereering", or "organized crime" might be more eloquent than "anti-mafia", but that might just be because I am a dunce.
[22:49:23] <LjL> "organizzazione di stampo mafioso" and related crimes are a thing only in the Italian penal code
[22:49:24] <bin> racketerring is specific
[22:49:28] <LjL> there is just no equivalent
[22:49:38] <bin> anti-mafia charges could be any number of charges
[22:49:38] <LjL> i'd quote it as-is with a literal translation in parentheses
[22:49:51] <LjL> I'd translate it as "mafia-type organization"
[22:50:02] <bin> why mafia-type?
[22:50:15] <LjL> because that's what the italian term says
[22:50:21] <bin> ah
[22:50:22] <TimMc> If it's not Italian, it's just sparkling organized crime.
[22:50:35] <TimMc> oh
[22:51:13] <LjL> it's not a charge, despite what sapzaiwa. it's a definition of an organization encompassing mafia itself and things "like mafia"
[22:51:21] <LjL> you can be charged for taking part in it
[22:51:33] <LjL> what they said*
[22:54:38] <bin> oh i thought it was two separate things
[22:54:59] <sapzaiwa> Mafia members can be charged with "associazione di tipo mafioso" in Italy.
[22:55:19] <sapzaiwa> So there's a paragraph with that name in Italian legislation.
[22:57:19] <sapzaiwa> In Sicilia e Calabria i carabinieri del Comando provinciale di Messina stanno dando esecuzione a misure cautelari emesse, su richiesta della Procura Distrettuale Antimafia guidata dal procuratore Maurizio de Lucia, nei confronti di 86 persone accusate a vario titolo di associazione di tipo mafioso, estorsione, scambio elettorale politico mafioso,
[22:57:19] <sapzaiwa> trasferimento fraudolento di valori, detenzione e porto illegale di armi, incendio, associazione finalizzata al traffico di sostanze stupefacenti, detenzione ai fini di spaccio di sostanze stupefacenti, sfruttamento della prostituzione, con l'aggravante del metodo mafioso.

[23:32:22] <twb> "mafia type" in English ought to simply be "organized crime"
[23:32:38] <LjL> except it's not
[23:32:56] <LjL> when you're talking about legal stuff, being exact is more important than sounding good
[23:33:12] <LjL> it's not like you can't say "organized crime" in italian: that's "crimine organizzato", and is a commonly used expression
[23:33:25] <LjL> but it isn't the same as "organizzazione di stampo mafioso"

[23:34:31] <twb> LjL: if you are talking about a specific person getting a specific sentence in Italy, then I would use the Italian as-is
[23:34:57] <LjL> uh i think you saw the above just like i did
[23:35:07] <LjL> there is a specific Italian sentence, and it includes that specific legal concept
[23:35:21] <LjL> that legal concept doesn't exist in English, so what you do is cite the italian and provide a literal translations in parentheses
[23:35:26] <LjL> which i've said like three times by now
[23:35:30] <LjL> so YES you would use the italian
[23:35:34] <twb> LjL: OK I agree with that
