[02:24:34] <feinedsquirrel> setting up a machine with a fresh install and wayland to try it out. to use the liveshare feature of vscode, I have to load gnome-keyring in the .xinitrc (on my other machines). I use .zprofile to start i3 on  my other machines, and was planning on doing the same to start sway on this test machine. is there a difference between putting the "eval $(/usr/bin/gnome-keyring-daemon --start ...)" ...

[02:25:42] <feinedsquirrel> correct, just login at the console

[02:26:47] <enyc> Itaru: ext4 is simple answer inless you have speficir reason otherwise.  exfat can be useful to work with some other OSes and new kernel 5.15 means ntfs for working with windows can work better, ... some use complex snapshotting and all that with btrfs ...  but there really is no need ot just storing one copy of large files !
[02:27:09] <feinedsquirrel> MrElendig: I've set up the "auth" and "session" lines in /etc/pam.d/login. Is that what you are referring to?
[02:27:19] <enyc> Itaru: the old vfat (i.e. FAT32/FAT16) may well not work because it cannot store files over 4gb  which may be some linux iso images for some distros
[02:27:42] <Betal> enyc: storing isos without duplication in btrfs can be bad
[02:28:09] <enyc> Betal: what do you mean?
[02:28:22] <Itaru> enyc, Thanks, I think I'll likely stick with ext4 then. Oh, also one of my drives is still using NTFS from back when I used it on a windows PC, would it be worth formatting it over to EXT4 or does it not really matter anymore with the new kernel driver?
[02:28:36] <masoudd> depends. if you may need to connect it to windows then pick something it can read
[02:28:41] <Betal> enyc: I didn't got corruption yet in btrfs to handle it, but you can't read the file at all

[02:29:19] <enyc> Itaru: if you don't need linux specific permissions, ntfs OUGHT to work though the new driver is just that... new and not so well tested in linux in general, and in any case  ext4 is rather superior in varous ways to ntfs

[02:29:37] <demonicmaniac1> ntfs on linux is still terrible performance wise and permissions wise with mapping stuff

[02:30:01] <MrElendig> lack of usable checkdisk is a bigger issue

[02:30:20] <demonicmaniac1> Scimmia: still worse than ext4/btrfs/etc though
[02:30:22] <Hello71> Scimmia: if you only consider speed...
[02:30:25] <enyc> does the new driver cope with  journal-replay and not throuwing a wobbly an not-cleanly-unmounted fs?

[10:10:39] <jmariondev> as in, sudo to root then your root shell isn't doing autocompletion?
[10:11:20] <arch> autocompleteion is happening without sudo command
[10:11:29] <arch> but not with sudo command
[10:11:52] <jmariondev> Oh I see, if you prefix the command with sudo then you can't autocomplete the rest of the command

[10:17:08] <arch> how to know i am using bash, as i am xfce terminal
[10:17:54] <jmariondev> you're probably using bash then, you can verify with `echo $SHELL`. if you are running bash and you've installed that package, open a new terminal and try to complete a sudo command

[10:20:58] <cskr> Did you start a new shell after installing the package. It gets loaded in /etc/bash.bashrc, takes effect when a shell starts.
[10:21:45] <jmariondev> logging out/back in will make sure the environment is updated, but `bash -l` may(?) do it

[16:08:30] <mpan> Of course teraflops might have wanted it in this case. I do not know. Hence “should likely be” and not “should be”.

[21:12:07] <OneDev> hi guys
[21:12:22] <OneDev> so every time that I use the "pkill --full gnome-shell ; gnome-shell --x11 --mode=user &
[21:12:22] <OneDev> " 
[21:12:29] <OneDev> to do the
[21:12:42] <OneDev> restart of session in place as --replace doesnt work always
[21:13:00] <OneDev> I have all of custom shortcuts gone and most of gnome shortcuts not working
[21:13:08] <OneDev> So I need to open and redo the shortcuts
[21:13:13] <TheArcaneBrony> why not just reload gnome?
[21:13:17] <OneDev> It happends over more then 6 months now.
[21:13:21] <TheArcaneBrony> press alt+f2, type r and hit enter
[21:13:25] <OneDev> As it doesnt work for me
[21:13:36] <OneDev> WhenI type r it just say no command 
[21:14:08] <OneDev> and if I do gnome-shell --replace in the alt+f2 it usually show up you need to log of screen
