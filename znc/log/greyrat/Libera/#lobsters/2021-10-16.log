[00:09:28] <JordiGH> We hate change.

[00:09:51] <JordiGH> And yet, web designers love moving and renaming buttons.
[00:11:47] <drobilla> JordiGH: People do indeed hate change, but there are plenty of other reasons people don't get excited about shiny-new-whatever.  As you say, a lot of it is just changing things for the sake of it, and often for the worse
[00:12:35] <JordiGH> Because you've spent a lot of time learning how to use your thing. Changing means you have to learn something whereas you see no problem doing whatever you're already doing.
[00:13:11] <JordiGH> Change means work, for no apparent good reason.

[00:13:54] <drobilla> I mean, as far as git and hg goes, hg isn't some new thing and people preferring git is just pure reactionaryism.  They're about the same age
[00:14:33] <JordiGH> hg is younger by a couple of weeks, depending how you count.
[00:14:36] <drobilla> I would switch if I had a reason to.  Seems like what I'd get is something that does the same thing but is a whole lot slower and less widely understood.  So, no thanks
[00:14:49] <JordiGH> > whole lot slower
[00:14:52] <JordiGH> >less understood
[00:14:54] <varjag> buttons are where the action is
[00:14:57] <JordiGH> You're so right on both accounts.
[00:15:48] <JordiGH> I'm kind of sad we're never getting rid of git, though.
[00:16:01] <JordiGH> That's like trying to get rid of ASCII.

[00:17:23] <drobilla> As someone said above, I think efforts would be better spent making shinier front-ends for it.  There's not much wrong with how git actually works.  Replacing it is very similar to "rewrite everything in Xlang because Xlang is so nice" to me, and I don't care for that either
[00:17:47] <JordiGH> Yeah, which is why we're also never getting rid of Cobol. Or C.
[00:18:25] <drobilla> Indeed.  The only way we will is if people approach those problems in less idealistic ways and _actually address the concerns of people who stick with those things_

[00:19:11] <JordiGH> I think what's wrong with how git works is that we never really wanted git to begin with. We didn't want branches and commits and commit messages and clones. We wanted to share code and figure out a way to not step on each other's toes. We're just stuck with branches and clones and commits as one way to do it.
[00:19:54] <drobilla> What we're really stuck with is a graph and some notion(s) of pointers to it.  Seems fine to me?
[00:20:08] <JordiGH> Subversion was popular because it was versioned ftp. That's what people wanted.
[00:20:12] <drobilla> Like, I get it, but "stuff is named in ways I don't like" is just so completely irrelevant to me
[00:20:42] <JordiGH> Nah, people don't even like nonlinearity. We just put up with it. Nobody likes thinking about a DAG if they can avoid it.
[00:20:44] <drobilla> What we really wanted in that era, I'd say, is the _distributed_ part (offline work in particular), and we got it

[00:24:10] <drobilla> It does give me quite some pleasure to see people lose hard to high quality implementation in C, I must say.  Despite the many problems of C, that cuts through a whole lot of programmer bullshit and shines a light on what actually matters IMO.

[03:59:31] <drobilla> It'd be fun to try a take on C-compatible by adding sum types instead of all the quasi-OO stuff
[03:59:42] <drobilla> Basically instead of looking at C and saying "let's add OO!", say "let's add ML!" instead
[04:00:36] <drobilla> Building directly off C isn't a very sensible approach for a practical "real language" these days, but it seems like a fun alternative-history sort of project

[05:02:29] <drobilla> I sort of feel the opposite way in a sense.  Very, very skeptical of people who actively like C++ :)
[05:03:10] <drobilla> (Being good at it, and actively liking it, being very different things)
[05:05:01] <companion_cube> "not as bad as C" isn't quite "I like it" :D
[05:05:09] <meff[m]> C++ is super useful though and supports libraries that most other languages don't have yet
[05:05:15] <meff[m]> I certainly enjoy how there's always a C++ way to do things
[05:05:38] <meff[m]> There's usually also a C way to do things but working with C for more than short snippets of code is really annoying/hard for me lol
[05:08:13] <drobilla> I've noticed particularly since Rust started gaining traction, that my feelings about writing new C and C++ have diverged quite a lot
[05:08:40] <drobilla> Writing C, funny as it may sound, feels like a solid long-term investment (mainly because I only use C in areas where that actually makes sense, and particularly not large applications)
[05:08:58] <drobilla> Writing C++ feels like investing in an already dead thing I want to replace as soon as possible
[05:09:14] <meff[m]> lol but it makes sense, Rust for me fills the same spot as C++ would

[11:18:25] <enterprisey> alright fellow crustaceans, I'm a little stuck on a job application
[11:19:01] <enterprisey> the last question is "make up a question that you wish we would have asked you here and answer it"
[11:19:38] <enterprisey> I know I'm supposed to choose a question that highlights something cool that I haven't talked about yet, but the application also includes a cover letter, so I'm sorta stuck
[11:19:43] <imode> copy and paste that question into that field and say "I'm just testing your stack depth."
[11:20:09] <imode> shows you understand mutual recursion. ;)
[11:20:12] <enterprisey> I was really considering a joke but I don't have that level of self-confidence and I would really like to work there
[11:20:24] <enterprisey> (it's a nuclear fusion company)
[11:20:47] <imode> I mean. what's a question you wish they would've asked.
[11:21:25] <enterprisey> I really can't think of any, that's the problem! Their questions were great

[12:54:13] <river> I really want to figure out and solve this issue ihave
[12:54:31] <river> if i play a game my computer does this grinding noise
[12:54:36] <river> its not hd, i think it is a fan
[12:54:40] <river> but i dont know how to figure out which one
[12:54:48] <river> it only happens when its at high load/temperature I guess
[12:55:26] <river> i guess i should take the side off and try to inspect it
[12:55:42] <river> but i dont even know how to fix it if i figure out what fan it is
[12:56:00] <epilys> could be just some loose screw
[12:56:15] <river> that, i can fix!
[12:56:19] <epilys> or something cables touching and vibrating
[12:56:41] <epilys> try to de-static yourself before you open it btw
[12:57:24] <river> i have an esd wristband
[12:57:34] <river> but my computer case is painted so i dunno if it does anything
[12:57:40] <river> like what would i attach it to
[12:57:59] <river> i try to touch the case so im at he same level as it
[12:58:12] <river> yeah vibrating cables is a possibility

[13:13:39] <river> what make scope is it!
[13:14:57] <Brekkjern> river: Most hardware can take some ESD nowadays, so you just need to be roughly at the same level as your computer. Attaching it to the case and wriggling it so you get through the paint will be more than good enough
[13:15:15] <river> ty!
[13:15:52] <Brekkjern> I don't even think the paint is all that insulating either to be honest

[23:45:44] <ngoldbaum> gerikson: did this guy seriously write a bot to scrape lobste.rs for HN karma

[23:46:17] <ngoldbaum> i guess so his shilling of his yahoo pipes clone is more credible?
[23:47:18] <gerikson> I don't think it's a bot
[23:47:26] <gerikson> I think he just follows the RSS feed
[23:49:30] <ngoldbaum> so strange
[23:49:42] <ngoldbaum> i guess if he doesn’t do it someone else would
[23:49:43] <cb> gerikson: he does it fairly quick on the draw
[23:49:48] <cb> like single digit minutes
[23:49:53] <cb> which makes me think bot
[23:50:10] <gerikson> yeah well I've already run a script that compares the times
[23:50:15] <gerikson> lemme run it again
[23:50:29] <cb> speaking at least for me: my sources are usually picking the 2-3 non-spam/outrage links on /r/prog and whatever's relevant from rss
[23:50:39] <cb> but i'm actually slow on the draw... usually within hours
[23:50:55] <gerikson> mmm
[23:51:19] <ngoldbaum> it’s also kinda random which stories he reposts, it’s not every single one
[23:51:27] <gerikson> yep
[23:51:38] <gerikson> that Genode repost hit the front page now
[23:54:16] <gerikson> he missed this one https://gerikson.com/hnlo/#obrx2q_28791006
