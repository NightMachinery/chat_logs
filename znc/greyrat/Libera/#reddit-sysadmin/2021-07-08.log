[04:13:52] <Jaelae> have to redo scripts 
[04:14:24] <Jaelae> someone created some pretty damn helpful powershell scripts to create a folder structure with nested subfolders. but im trying to understand the logic because if the parent folder matches another folder it creates all those nested subfolders under there as well
[04:15:18] <enix> Any reason you can't loop over one of the levels separately to the entire thing
[04:15:38] <enix> Often there's little point spending time in addressing "what if"s when you can just put a loop in a loop
[04:15:48] <enix> Especially if you're talking about a pretty set in stone thing
[04:16:27] <enix> while read parent_dir ; do mkdir $parent_dir ; while read child_dir ; do mkdir -p $parent_dir/$child_dir ; done < child-dirs ; done < parent-dirs
[04:16:56] <enix> actually in that you can s/mkdir $parent_dir ;//g
[04:17:17] <enix> thats bash btw not ps. i have standards sorry

[05:17:13] <misspwn> my ring just sits in a little ceramic bowl. one of my stones fell out and then the pandemic happened, pregnancy happened and it didn't fit. now it just gets in the way i might actually think of getting a silicon band to wear to work instead

[05:31:38] <dragonfleas> is it unethical for someone to lie about their current salary when interviewing for new jobs and basically say "well i make y, I'm expecting a x% increase to z" even though you make less than y
[05:31:54] <dragonfleas> i know people do this, but i am just curious if people think it's unethical or not
[05:31:55] <xe0n> you dont say im expecting an increase at all
[05:31:58] <xe0n> just say you make X amount
[05:32:04] <xe0n> its up to them to decide whether they pay you more lol

[05:32:25] <xe0n> they can't find out so meh
[05:32:30] <Alternity> Just don't give out your salary

[05:32:58] <Alternity> recruiters give it to me about 70% of the time on the first request

[05:36:49] <Alternity> trying to get 200k base now but that might be tough we'll see
[05:37:00] <dragonfleas> anyways, this job is my foot in the door, learning k8s, learning ansible, learning chef, learning terraform etc etc
[05:37:13] <Alternity> absolutely dude, first job is the hardest to get
[05:37:15] <dragonfleas> trying to learn this shit as hard as i can and get expert level in at least or or two of those tools
[05:37:20] <Alternity> k8s and TF are good stuff, big $$$
[05:37:27] <Alternity> ansible imo is on its way out but some companies its very valuable
[05:37:32] <Alternity> fuck chef tho lul, sorry you gotta deal with it
[05:37:41] <dragonfleas> we're a ruby on rails shop too :|
[05:38:00] <dragonfleas> our entire dev team are all ruby fanboys
[05:38:02] <Alternity> ruby gets a bad rap... those are all great skills tho
[05:38:11] <dragonfleas> i don't like the package manager
[05:38:13] <dragonfleas> it's god awful

[05:38:41] <dragonfleas> i really really like terraform
[05:38:47] <dragonfleas> it's been a TON of fun
[05:38:54] <Alternity> really helped me. i went from about 80k as a sr sysadmin to 120k as cloud engineer with it
[05:39:15] <dragonfleas> yeah so i asked around my other senior devops coworkers
[05:39:15] <Alternity> lol i've done so much terraform now i'm kinda sick of it.
[05:39:28] <dragonfleas> i'm making around what 1 or 2 of them are
[05:39:31] <Alternity> im way past the honeymoon phase, im at the 7 year itch :P

[05:39:47] <dragonfleas> or wait sorry

[05:39:53] <Alternity> thats why you gotta keep changing jobs every few years to get the best pay
[05:40:01] <dragonfleas> and he's making 195k
[05:40:13] <Alternity> wow very nice. thats def around the top of the range
[05:40:19] <dragonfleas> yeah he's genius level
[05:40:26] <dragonfleas> been in devops since inception of the buzzword basically lol
[05:40:33] <Alternity> lol i'm not at all but i can buzzword real good in interviews :D
[05:40:48] <dragonfleas> i'm excited for the 15% bonus

[05:41:01] <Alternity> even if im not really looking
[05:41:04] <MoonBounce> I havent changed jobs since i got one out of college lol
[05:41:05] * gibby farts gibbyfarts.com
[05:41:22] <Alternity> 15% is nice, my job does 10% but i only really consider base and equity. bonus to me is funny money until its in my bank account
[05:41:32] <dragonfleas> i will immediately invest it in bitcoin and buy thousands of dollars worth of ass clown porn on the deep web
[05:41:40] <gibby> ...
[05:41:43] <MoonBounce> i got like 30% bonus last year
[05:41:43] <Alternity> you're probably missing out on a lot of earning potential statically MoonBounce
[05:41:50] <dragonfleas> holy SHIT
[05:41:52] <dragonfleas> 30%??
[05:41:59] <dragonfleas> you work in fintech?
[05:42:01] <Alternity> dragonfleas seems like a sound plan
[05:42:01] <MoonBounce> yea
[05:42:05] <dragonfleas> sounds about right
[05:42:15] <MoonBounce> i was getting like 7-10% raises for the past 2 years so i figured no point of moving
[05:42:21] <Alternity> makes sense, fintech is wild. you work 40/h week tho MoonBounce?
[05:42:24] <MoonBounce> went from 60k to like 85k
[05:42:35] <MoonBounce> bonus was like 20k or so
[05:42:38] <Alternity> ye thats pretty good, though 85k is not amazing depending o what you do
[05:42:45] <Alternity> on what you do*
[05:42:53] <MoonBounce> im just ur avg sysadmin jack of all trades
[05:42:59] <dragonfleas> that's not an awful salary
[05:43:01] <MoonBounce> i'd say most days its 40 hrs 
[05:43:05] <dragonfleas> depends on where you live
[05:43:07] <Alternity> ah kk, thats pretty reasonable then.
[05:43:08] <MoonBounce> nyc so meh
[05:43:11] <dragonfleas> oh fuck that
[05:43:14] <Alternity> oh fuck thats rough
[05:43:23] <dragonfleas> fuck that noise pay me 120k minimum to scrub toilets in nyc
[05:43:31] <MoonBounce> the problem with finance sysadmin stuff is
[05:43:37] <MoonBounce> strict change control and having to do stuff outside of market hours
[05:43:49] <Alternity> fintech you can make extremely good money
[05:43:50] <dragonfleas> how often do the traders give you coke tho?
[05:43:59] <Alternity> i'd suggest starting to interview around now that you have experience i nthe field
[05:44:00] <MoonBounce> i dont work at a hedge fund thank god
[05:44:04] <dragonfleas> lmfao
[05:44:11] <MoonBounce> im pretty sure if helpdesk at a hedge fund place
[05:44:12] <MoonBounce> makes 100k+
[05:44:15] <MoonBounce> in manhattan
[05:44:29] <dragonfleas> one of my colleagues said they came from being sysadmin at a hedge fund energy sector place, and literally they'd have piles of cocaine on their desks
[05:44:32] <dragonfleas> just out in the open
[05:44:35] <Alternity> honestly i'd need like, 300k base and couple hundred in rsu's for NYC to be worth it

[05:45:51] <Alternity> 2 years is pretty solid generally
[05:46:00] <Alternity> though i seem to get bored faster than that though
[05:46:02] <dragonfleas> i might wait 3, just to get as sharp as possible
[05:46:17] <MoonBounce> but yeah ive only been in the industry for like
[05:46:21] <MoonBounce> 3-4 years so its good enough for me
[05:46:24] <Alternity> my last job was a year and change, this one i'm at like 8 months and getting a bit itchy. was 3 years before that though at a gig
[05:46:29] <dragonfleas> MoonBounce, 1600 get's you a closet right?
[05:46:36] <dragonfleas> how many sq foot is your place 150?
[05:46:39] <MoonBounce> like 300-400 sq ft
[05:46:42] <dragonfleas> LOOOOOOOOOOOOL

[05:47:36] <sd> 10<n​emisys> So what is the draw of NYC?  It just seems like you can get so much more for your money almost anywhere else?
[05:47:43] <Alternity> other things in life are important
[05:47:48] <MoonBounce> we dont have helpdesk and its like a team of 4 sysadmins (i've interviewed with other finance places in the past and this seems kinda common for some reason)
[05:48:06] <Alternity> the key imo is to get out of sysadmin title
[05:48:14] <Alternity> and into engineering roles
[05:48:19] <MoonBounce> idk whats the draw of nyc cause i was born here lol
[05:48:32] <dragonfleas> yeah once you have engineer in title you automatically look more valuable
[05:48:38] <MoonBounce> i do have engineer in my title lol
[05:48:41] <dragonfleas> :O
[05:48:42] <MoonBounce> but i do maybe like
[05:48:49] <Alternity> nemisys there are certain careers like theater or fashion where there are only a few places you can live and make a good living.
[05:48:53] <MoonBounce> 20-30% helpdesk and the rest is sysadmin projects/maintenace
[05:48:58] <Alternity> also certain communities that only exist in some of the biggest cities
[05:49:04] <dragonfleas> yep
[05:49:06] <dragonfleas> voiceover is ONLY in LA
[05:49:08] <dragonfleas> :(
[05:49:17] <dragonfleas> so i have to move closer to there, ideally i'd live in the colorado rockies
[05:49:18] <MoonBounce> the problem is helpdesk shit is so inconsistent, some days we'll get 0 tickets, some days we'll get so many tickets that i cant work on anything else
[05:49:26] <xe0n> yup
[05:49:30] <xe0n> front line baby
[05:49:43] <dragonfleas> are you sole role or something
[05:49:46] <xe0n> thats why you start in helpdesk, gain some experience (more softskills than tech in most cases)
[05:49:47] <Alternity> i mostly only do project work now. the mor emoneoy i make the less work i do tbh
[05:49:48] <xe0n> then you move on
[05:49:49] <MoonBounce> nah a team of 4
[05:49:49] <dragonfleas> oh wait 4 sysadmins
[05:49:51] <MoonBounce> we rotate
[05:49:57] <dragonfleas> yeah that's basically sole role though
[05:50:00] <dragonfleas> you're in a small shop
[05:50:00] <Alternity> its a funny paradox how you do less work the more you make
[05:50:08] <MoonBounce> how is that sole role lol
[05:50:12] <xe0n> sure, thats also an attitude thing lol
[05:50:15] <dragonfleas> if you guys rotate
[05:50:25] <MoonBounce> we dont rotate shifts we just rotate doing helpdesk tickets
[05:50:27] <dragonfleas> OH
[05:50:32] <dragonfleas> i thought you meant you are alone sometimes lol
[05:50:42] <Alternity> MoonBounce dont get too comfy. keep interviewing for stuff you dont think you are qualified for
[05:50:45] <dragonfleas> ^^^
[05:50:47] <Alternity> thats how you grow your skillset
[05:50:53] <dragonfleas> literally make friends in IT as well
[05:51:00] <dragonfleas> connections can get you solid ass shit
[05:51:01] <MoonBounce> do most finance places do the
[05:51:03] <Alternity> if i start a new job and dont feel slightly overwhelmed and some imposter syndrome i know i took too easy of a job
[05:51:06] <MoonBounce> super day style gauntlet interview
[05:51:17] <dragonfleas> which is better than liquid ass shit
[05:51:33] <MoonBounce> yeah thats true
[05:51:38] <MoonBounce> the problem is i dont really feel comfortable
[05:51:45] <Alternity> ye connections are the best ways to get jobs, prequalified in many cases. too bad i suck at networking lul
[05:51:52] <dragonfleas> Alternity, LMAO i got into this devops job knowing absolutely 0 about devops tooling but they said none of them had windows admin skills and liked that i did so they hired me
[05:51:54] <MoonBounce> theirs tons of stuff i want to implement and do but office politics/bureacracy/bullshit keeps weighing me down
[05:52:31] <Alternity> dragonfleas nice nice. thats a real score. keep finding opt to work on TF and k8s and  you be banking cash soon. also can try to introduce SRE concepts as an excuse to build your resume
[05:52:46] <Alternity> also i assume you can code somewhat. bash, python, golang are the big ones for devooops
[05:53:22] <MoonBounce> im mostly a windows engineer only
[05:53:29] <MoonBounce> linux is a different team sadly
[05:53:35] <Alternity> working on this  myself, my python/golang skills are not amazing
[05:53:36] <MoonBounce> i do some powershell tho
[05:53:40] <dragonfleas> uh yeah i can
[05:53:46] <dragonfleas> but only javascript & python :(
[05:53:47] <dragonfleas> no go
[05:53:47] <Alternity> thats another reason tbh to change jobs MoonBounce. windows admin kinda sucks
[05:54:03] <dragonfleas> i'm way stronger in javascript than python
[05:54:04] <Alternity> if you know python well you're pretty golden. golang isn't too hard to learn relatively speaking
[05:54:20] <Alternity> and i've seen js and ts more in devops last few years
[05:54:36] <MoonBounce> yeah it seems all the money is on the linux side
[05:54:38] <dragonfleas> i love js and ts a ton, would like to stick with them
[05:54:40] <MoonBounce> windows side doesnt make as much
[05:54:45] <dragonfleas> oh yeah we're 95% linux
[05:54:50] <dragonfleas> we have some MSSQL servers and that's it
[05:55:02] <Alternity> i was a sr windows sysadmin, bailed on that cuz windows admins are a dime a dozen and honestly trying to do HA stuff and run critical services on windows is painful and unpleasant
[05:55:03] <dragonfleas> app servers, service containers, everything all RHEL
[05:55:11] <MoonBounce> we have like 200 windows servers and hundreds of linux servers
[05:55:13] <dragonfleas> we're actually looking into openshift right now
[05:55:17] <Alternity> i hear sql server on  linux is actually pretty solid
[05:55:18] <dragonfleas> which would be an awesome skill to have
[05:55:25] <dragonfleas> we're about to move to it Alternity :)
[05:55:38] <enix> Just double check it supports everytihng you need
[05:55:47] <enix> It doesn't support every feature
[05:55:53] <Alternity> getting to six figures doing just windows was super tough, as soon as i switched to cloud and devops stuff it was easy
[05:55:57] <dragonfleas> i help out our local sysadmins a lot with our active directory and on-prem servers, vmware stuff
[05:55:57] <MoonBounce> honestly though I wanna probably move more into the cloud side, like azure, o365, intune management, etc
[05:56:05] <enix> also welcome back dragonfleas 
[05:56:14] <dragonfleas> I BEEN BACK ENIX
[05:56:16] <dragonfleas> but ty
[05:56:16] <MoonBounce> been trying to push it at my current place but stupid shit always get in the way :(
[05:56:17] <Alternity> azure and aws are great. o365 and intune are trash that wont pay very well
[05:56:25] <MoonBounce> o365 is great wym lol
[05:56:28] <dragonfleas> i'm just waiting to get banned by gibby, my day will come soon
[05:56:29] <xe0n> speak for yourself
[05:56:29] <Alternity> also boring as fuck 
[05:56:29] <xe0n> lol
[05:56:34] <MoonBounce> yeah true
[05:56:37] <Alternity> ye o365 is a nice offering for customers
[05:56:40] <MoonBounce> whats the hate on intune?
[05:56:45] <Alternity> but you'll figure everything out about it pretty quick
[05:56:52] <dragonfleas> intune is really sick imo
[05:56:54] <MoonBounce> Im thinking it has a lot of value with the hybrid work people are doing
[05:56:59] <dragonfleas> i like intune a lot
[05:57:00] <Alternity> i just find MDM in general to be a trashfire and unpleasant to work on
[05:57:08] <gibby> why would I ban you dragonfleas? 
[05:57:12] <MoonBounce> but it seems thats where the industry is going lol
[05:57:16] <gibby> You're a source of endless comedy. 
[05:57:16] <MoonBounce> like for mac management u have to use mdm
[05:57:25] <MoonBounce> well not "have to" but u get my point
[05:57:28] <Alternity> for me its all about what is both interesting and highest paying
[05:57:45] <Alternity> i find MDM disinteresting and the pay is pretty bad
[05:57:52] <MoonBounce> does any of you guys use servicenow? 
[05:57:55] <Alternity> i find cloud, ,devops and SRE especially interesting problems and very well paid
[05:58:08] <Alternity> i have a buddy who is a servicenow consultant and makes insane insane money
[05:58:12] <Alternity> he loves it
[05:58:21] <MoonBounce> i hate servicenow so much but the product is good imo
[05:58:25] <Alternity> he's also a JS wizard
[05:58:41] <MoonBounce> we spend like few hundred k on it but refuse to hire any consultants and barely improve it
[05:58:47] <Alternity> there are some consulting niches like that that are really money
[05:58:48] <enix> servicenow..
[05:58:55] <MoonBounce> only like 2 people are allowed to "modify" it and those people are always too busy
[05:59:01] <MoonBounce> its so asinine
[05:59:04] <Alternity> everyone hates oracle ofc but oracle consultants make wild money
[05:59:29] <Alternity> sharepoint consultants as well *shudder*
[05:59:32] <enix> It's all apart of finding your niche
[05:59:35] <MoonBounce> thank god for 365 sharepoint lol
[05:59:42] <enix> And knowing it well enough to command money for your amazingness
[05:59:43] <MoonBounce> i never had to manage on prem exchange or sharepoint
[05:59:45] <MoonBounce> luckily
[06:00:08] <Alternity> i look every year at the stack exchange salary survey of languages and jobs
[06:00:14] <xe0n> MoonBounce: nothing wrong with it
[06:00:16] <Alternity> to figure out what pays the most and what is interesting
[06:00:24] <Alternity> SRE roles tend to top that list for me at least
[06:00:34] <MoonBounce> idk it just seems like a pita to manage on prem exchange compared to 365
[06:00:39] <enix> oh I loved on-prem exchange
[06:00:39] <xe0n> not really
[06:00:40] <Alternity> wish i was smart enough for a FAANG as that is the highest money
[06:00:45] <enix> super simple
[06:00:53] <MoonBounce> honestly at this point
[06:00:56] <MoonBounce> i just want a full remote job
[06:01:02] <gibby> listen, if I can manage sharepoint, exchange, teams, etc w/ o365, any of you can.
[06:01:03] <MoonBounce> seems that doesnt really exist on the windows side again lol
[06:01:07] <enix> So much access to things.  Ran beautifully and never broke
[06:01:16] <xe0n> yes it does MoonBounce...
[06:01:16] <enix> like #nosarcasm
[06:01:16] <xe0n> lol
[06:01:17] <Alternity> most devops roles recruiters send me on linkedin are fully remote.
[06:01:22] <Alternity> they are so desperate for ppl lol
[06:01:26] <MoonBounce> i mean it exists but it seems theirs much less
[06:01:42] <enix> god i'd love a full remote job
[06:01:42] <MoonBounce> when i tried searching for remote jobs it seems most of them were aimed at linux/devops aws stuff etc
[06:01:52] <enix> yeah easier to do it with our kit
[06:01:53] <Alternity> thats pretty accurate MoonBounce
[06:02:04] <Alternity> thats why getting out of helpdesk basic bitch shit is so important
[06:02:13] <Alternity> its easy to hire for those roles, lots of ppl
[06:02:20] <Alternity> and it tends to be hands on
[06:02:23] <MoonBounce> we used to have a intern who did the helpdesk bitch shit for us
[06:02:26] <Alternity> i do 100% azure infrastructure stuff atm
[06:02:26] <enix> Alternity: 'people' is a little generous
[06:02:27] <MoonBounce> it was soooo nice
[06:02:36] <MoonBounce> but then he hit some legal limit to work so we had to let him go
[06:02:45] <Alternity> enix generous? i thought i was pretty mean with the windows basic bitch part :P
[06:03:00] <enix> I think basic is giving them too much credit
[06:03:10] *** Quits: PeterEaston (~JollyRoge@user/thejollyroger) (Quit: PeterEaston)
[06:03:21] <Alternity> honestly i feel bad for anyone entering traditional IT these days
[06:03:23] <xe0n> PETER EASTON
[06:03:26] <Alternity> entry level stuff is kinda awful
[06:03:32] <MoonBounce> yeah and its inflated cause of all the ppl
[06:03:36] <enix> xe0n: that's THE Jollr Rogers
[06:03:36] <MoonBounce> trying to enter "tech"
[06:03:38] <MoonBounce> for the money
[06:03:38] <Alternity> i'd advise any teenager to get a CS degree and go into software engineering
[06:03:55] <Alternity> and then move into infrastructure from the software side if they like it
[06:03:56] <enix> I tried to push jxel into AI
[06:03:57] <MoonBounce> sometimes i think about what my life would've been like if i became a soft eng instead
[06:03:59] <enix> eh
[06:04:05] <MoonBounce> but i dont really like programming tbh, scripting is fun tho
[06:04:23] <Alternity> ML can be tough since you often need advanced degrees and advanced maths
[06:04:29] <Alternity> i can't do linear algebra at all 
[06:04:32] <MoonBounce> yeah dont u need a masters for that rap
[06:04:36] <MoonBounce> or phd
[06:04:49] <enix> i feel like i could google it tbh
[06:05:05] <enix> never mind, i felt wrong.
[06:05:09] <MoonBounce> lul
[06:05:10] <xe0n> yeah
[06:05:10] <Alternity> idk from what little i knwo you cant wing it the way you can in IT
[06:05:10] <xe0n> lol

[06:16:14] <Alternity> there are other channels/discords/slacks i use for devoops and more technical things
[06:16:33] <Alternity> i feel like most of my convos in here are just me encouraging ppl to demand mor emoney :D
[06:16:41] <MoonBounce> i really wanted to setup sccm
[06:16:42] <xe0n> yeah, we feel that too

[06:17:33] <MoonBounce> yo so 
[06:17:41] <MoonBounce> my company pays for my uber rides to the office
[06:17:42] <dragonfleas> i bought someone a dominos gift card in here and they ended up living in germany and couldn't use it
[06:17:45] <MoonBounce> but otherwise i work remote
[06:17:48] <dragonfleas> i can't remember who that was
[06:17:52] <xe0n> rpifan
[06:17:52] <Alternity> exchange admin seems like the ultimate dead end. right up there with starting an oracle db career
[06:17:52] <xe0n> LOL
[06:17:56] <dragonfleas> that shit was hilarious
[06:17:57] <MoonBounce> since covid, i wonder how long they'll keep letting me expense it
[06:18:00] <MoonBounce> its literally like $100 both ways
[06:18:01] <xe0n> ah no its not a dead end Alternity lol
[06:18:11] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> Alternity: Most of what you do besides the log-in to OS and apply updates/initial config is identical to O365
[06:18:23] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> If you can manage Exch 2013+, you can manage O365
[06:18:29] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> just a matter of switching mindsets
[06:18:31] <sd> 10<n​emisys> Hell I am a linux admin and feel like that's kind of going away too.  All our web servers are gonna be cloud in a few years.
[06:18:33] <Alternity> xe0n ye i'm sure it will be around at larger corps for a long time and pay well if you can get the jobs. but seems like a small and shrinking niche
[06:18:35] <MoonBounce> i hate the o365 gui
[06:18:37] <MoonBounce> so unreliable
[06:18:37] <Alternity> as far as careers go
[06:18:50] <xe0n> then use powershell MoonBounce like they kinda tell you too..
[06:18:51] <xe0n> lol
[06:18:54] <MoonBounce> usually i just try do it to on gui cause i dont remember the powershell command on the top of my head so i figure itll be quick on the gui
[06:18:58] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> MoonBounce: The classic EAC is nice, almost 100% identical to onprem if you're used to that
[06:19:04] <witheringwanton> Small and medium sized businesses won't be moving to the cloud anytime soon
[06:19:05] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> the new stuff is kinda weird though
[06:19:05] <MoonBounce> then it takes like 10 minutes to load and i go back to powershell lol
[06:19:09] <Alternity> nemisys the move to containers has dampened some of the need for deep linux skills, but there is def still a pretty good market for those things and it is high paying
[06:19:15] <MoonBounce> ive never used on prem
[06:19:16] <Alternity> since not a lot of people have deep knowledge
[06:19:41] <xe0n> its all the same shit ;x
[06:19:46] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> MoonBounce: Only major difference between 365 EAC and onprem EAC is that onprem is *usually* far faster to respond .... and 365 doesn't have the server specific shit
[06:19:50] <Alternity> especially if you are managing/optimisizing critical expensive systems
[06:19:55] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> like "configure this cert for that server"
[06:20:14] <MoonBounce> we dont have automated cert enrollment setup
[06:20:21] <MoonBounce> even after outages
[06:20:24] <sd> 10<n​emisys> Alternity, thanks, that's good to know.  I do other things too, but I'm now "the Linux guy," where we used to have multiple Linux guys
[06:20:38] <Alternity> i remember o365 being slow as hell sometimes. it was fun to do some powershell queries and see the hacky shit they do on the backend to manage the AD integration parts of o365 exchange
[06:20:45] <MoonBounce> the best we have is email alerting that a cert is expiring, and we have so many alerts that i have to tell a few people on the IT team that their hitting the 100gb inbox limit soon
[06:20:49] <Alternity> nemisys become the k8s guy :)
[06:20:56] <MoonBounce> like how tf u hitting 100gb inbox
[06:20:59] <MoonBounce> just w/ alerts
[06:21:22] <Alternity> if an alert is not actionable its not a useful alert
[06:21:26] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> Alternity: Yea the whole using AAD accounts for 365 exchange is kind of cool to me - because of how traditionally AD reliant exchange is, it's almost like they just replicate objects into something else or something, who knows
[06:21:36] <Alternity> jobs where i couldn't get them to prune alerts just means i create a mail filter rule for that stuff
[06:21:41] <MoonBounce> yeah our alerting is trash, im trying to move ours to Microsoft Teams tbh
[06:21:51] <MoonBounce> so only useful alerts get posted on a teams channel and i can ignore all emails
[06:22:06] *** Joins: JollyRoger (~JollyRoge@user/thejollyroger)

[06:22:16] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> I'm practically "the monitoring guy" for half our systems, so I have a rule taht sends everything including info to me, but only tuned and ready alerts go to say, the engineering DLs or whatever

[06:22:31] <enix> Did you Eatson
[06:22:37] <enix> Sorry, eat, son?
[06:22:37] <witheringwanton> I've heard Zabbix is good for monitoring, is this true?
[06:22:42] <JollyRoger> Hey, Thanks enix!
[06:22:53] <Alternity> zabbix is good if you have a traditional infrastructure
[06:22:55] <MoonBounce> i heard good things about zabbix as well
[06:22:57] <MoonBounce> i want to get PRTG 
[06:22:58] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> those people only get shit like ALERT STATUS: NEW - DISK TOO DAMN FULL or ALERT STATUS: CLOSED - SYSTEM NO LONGER FUKT
[06:23:04] <MoonBounce> i wanna get prtg, logicmonitor, etc
[06:23:07] <Alternity> modern monitoring for containers tend to be stuff like prometheus
[06:23:17] <Alternity> time series and metrics
[06:23:22] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> i'm slowly expanding it to cover AWS, Azure, our own cloud product, and 365
[06:23:25] <MoonBounce> our current monitoring solution is so fucking painful that it takes me upwards of 20-30 minutes sometimes just to install the agent kek
[06:23:31] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> wut
[06:23:33] <Alternity> i'm implementing datadog atm for our cloud infra
[06:23:55] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> SCCM deploys my agent automatically while a server's being set up, i just go into the console and click approve
[06:24:00] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> automation yay
[06:24:02] <MoonBounce> i really really wanted SCCM
[06:24:08] <MoonBounce> my dream was SCCM for servers, intune for desktops
[06:24:10] <Alternity> MoonBounce beauty of containers, bake that shit into a layer. or use a sidecar with k8s
[06:24:28] <MoonBounce> nah its for windows servers, the issue is mostly the cert auto enrollment takes forever 
[06:24:40] <Alternity> man fuck sccm, run
[06:24:42] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> SCCM won't .... really help with that without writing the glue yourself
[06:24:50] <Alternity> talk about another dying niche
[06:25:01] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> SCCM is damn bloody powerful and hella useful, but ....
[06:25:03] <MoonBounce> yeah but whats considered the replacement
[06:25:06] <MoonBounce> to sccm
[06:25:07] <Alternity> even m icrosoft wants to kill off sccm i think and move everyone to intune and autopilot
[06:25:08] <xe0n> we get it Alternity, you're a code guy...
[06:25:10] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> Co-Management for workstations is the place to be for complete coverage
[06:25:14] <xe0n> no they dont?!
[06:25:15] <MoonBounce> i understand intune can handle the end client sides
[06:25:15] <xe0n> wtf
[06:25:28] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> Alternity: That won't happen for a long damn time - SCCM is having a lot of awsome active development
[06:25:29] <MoonBounce> but their isnt really a "cloud" patching product from microsoft i feel
[06:25:32] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> some of that is in integration parts to cloud
[06:25:32] <MoonBounce> to replace sccm for servers
[06:25:44] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> MoonBounce: Azure has functions for this
[06:25:47] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> costs extra though
[06:25:52] <Alternity> ye sccm is very powerful. it will be intereseting to see where it goes over next few years
[06:25:52] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> for on-prem servers even
[06:26:05] *** Joins: redstarcomrade (uid99592@user/redstarcomrade)
[06:26:10] <MoonBounce> yeah we have 0 azure footprint so whenever i try to setup anything in azure, the question immediately becomes : y not aws
[06:26:14] <Alternity> just seems like they would rather move you to azure pieces and get more MRR from you
[06:26:18] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> Alternity: I've liked a lot of the stuff they've done since they moved to that more frequent release model - and they're responding to customer input so fast
[06:26:21] <MoonBounce> then aws is not handled by my team so it goes into black hole
[06:26:25] <Jaelae> we have azure, google cloud, and aws - its insanity
[06:26:29] <Jaelae> stick to one provider!
[06:26:34] <Alternity> microsoft overall is much much better than they were a decade ago
[06:26:40] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> Alternity: I mean, to use the more freuqent SCCM releases and not the LTSC ones, you need to have SA anyway
[06:26:53] <MoonBounce> yeah i feel the satya era is a lot better
[06:26:59] <MoonBounce> in terms of direction
[06:27:01] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> otherwise you have to revert to the newest LTSC version after your SA lapses
[06:27:03] <Alternity> depends on your size Jaelae, but i would agree that multi-cloud is overrated except for very large companies
[06:27:06] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> so they're still getting routine revenue from you
[06:27:14] <MoonBounce> i just want azure for WVD and SSO login to it 
[06:27:18] <Jaelae> we are large Alternity  - so yea i think for us we do want the diverse use
[06:27:23] <Jaelae> and multiple silos that want to do their own thing
[06:27:32] <MoonBounce> cause WVD sounds mad nice, both for security and for onboarding users remotely
[06:27:33] <Jaelae> but some projects (SAP) exist on multiple platforms
[06:27:47] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> Having just one cloud provider isn't really a *bad* thing, so to say, but you should have an exit plan in case you need to make a rapid switch for whatever reason
[06:28:00] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> like say, using vRanger to migrate 'traiditonal' infra style VMs between providers or something
[06:28:03] <Alternity> big companies tend to have politics around it as well, using different cloud provider is seen as a good way to insulate their fiefdoms within the company
[06:28:31] <MoonBounce> i hate politics so much
[06:28:35] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> we eat our own dogfood so to speak, we use AWS and Azure both and sell both to our customers, as well as our own internal cloud platform that competes ina  specific segment against AWS and Azure
[06:28:35] <Alternity> also plenty of execs just want the bullet point that they built out a big project on their resume so they can bounce after a couple years even if it was shit
[06:28:37] <MoonBounce> i just wanna do my work but ppl gotta have egos over stupid shit
[06:28:45] <Jaelae> its hard to support with diverse on prem and cloud
[06:28:48] <csws> MoonBounce, bout once every month ago I'd have to clean up a mailbox with 100 GB mailbox & 100 GB recoverable items
[06:28:50] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> it's funny seeing which customer ends up where just because of their agency preferences
[06:28:54] <csws> and this is with in place archiving and a policy to move after 6 months
[06:28:55] <Jaelae> if you want to be diverse you have to hire people to support it too
[06:28:56] <csws> these users were nuts
[06:29:02] <Jaelae> im only privy to our aws billing though and man
[06:29:04] <Alternity> if your stack is very modern and clean its not to bad Jaelae
[06:29:04] <Jaelae> it is astronomical
[06:29:16] <MoonBounce> csws i remind people once or twice then i give up and let them figure out why they arent receieving email
[06:29:25] <Alternity> like if you're mostly k8s for example you can use AKS and EKS + terraform for most things across clouds
[06:29:27] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> Alternity: The only thing I don't like too much about a "true" multicloud strategy is getting limited
[06:29:34] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> in terms of capability
[06:29:41] <Alternity> but for any company with legacy systems its way more of a nightmare
[06:29:56] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> so say, being limited to traditional SQL logins on azure so you can be portable to AWS's
[06:30:02] <Alternity> and even then the devil is in the details
[06:30:07] <csws> MoonBounce, the worst part about recoverable items filling up is that mail mostly works but calendar stuff starts breaking, like if someone sends them a cancellation it'll NDR as exchange wasn't able to remove the invite
[06:30:20] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> a lot of it is minor shit but it still can bite you in the ass if you need to switch or expand to another provider
[06:30:27] <Alternity> since evne with fancy k8s you're probably still using a managed database offering for stateful things
[06:30:47] <Alternity> and there are plenty of differences between azure sql and RDS
[06:30:48] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> ^ that's how the SQL login issue came up.....
[06:31:14] <MoonBounce> i would never cleanup a mailbox for a user
[06:31:17] <MoonBounce> they'll never learn
[06:31:28] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> that 'recoverable items' bit means they haven't aged out yet
[06:31:31] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> and deleted a shitload of stuff
[06:31:34] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> then got filled up again
[06:31:36] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> the user can't see that part
[06:31:52] <Alternity> i remember one company i worked for had a 6 month mail retention. anything older was auto deleted so it wouldn't be a liability legally
[06:31:54] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> so you end up in a state sometimes where you legit can't delete more shit
[06:31:55] <Alternity> loved it
[06:31:55] <xe0n> admin error
[06:31:58] <MoonBounce> yea we use mimecast
[06:32:01] <MoonBounce> everything is saved
[06:32:05] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> Alternity: I think any sane large company has that
[06:32:18] <cryptic1> send money
[06:32:21] <Alternity> sadly most other companies i've worked for were regulated and couldn't get rid of it :(
[06:32:21] <MoonBounce> we have no retention policy lolol
[06:32:29] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> There's regulatory retention for some shit
[06:32:32] <MoonBounce> i need to ask my compliance officer about enabling o365 group expiration
[06:32:36] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> like specific contract stuff, financial, etc
[06:32:41] <Alternity> i'm hoping my next job will be in something not regulated
[06:32:45] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> i know financial shit is 7 years
[06:32:49] <cryptic1> send it now
[06:32:50] <Alternity> fucking tired of compliance frameworks and other nonsense
[06:32:53] <cryptic1> need money
[06:32:55] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> but that's a relatively small  scope
[06:32:55] <cryptic1> now
[06:33:00] <MoonBounce> we're a regulated entity too but somehow we focus on the wrong parts
[06:33:02] <xe0n> Alternity: welcome to reality
[06:33:15] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> Our retention policy is just 3 months
[06:33:27] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> i've been bit by it before since we moved to having that instead of just having 10MB or 100MB mailboxes
[06:33:50] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> "here's 50gig a user..... email autodeletes unless you move it before 3 months..... oh and you can't set up autoarchive rules..... and online archive only"

[06:38:48] <d1> I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you’re referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX. Many 
[06:38:48] <d1> computer use version of the GNU system every day, without ...
[06:38:48] <d1> ... realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called “Linux”, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program allocates the machine’s resources to 
[06:38:48] <d1> the other programs that you run. The kernel is an ...
[06:38:48] <d1> ... essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU//Linux. All the so-called “Linux” distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux.

[06:39:03] <d1> I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as Linux, is in fact, Windows Subsystem for Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, WSL. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free app in the Microsoft Store and part of a fully functioning Windows system made useful by the Windows OS, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS

[06:39:38] <d1> I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you’re referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX. Many 
[06:39:38] <d1> computer use version of the GNU system every day, without ...
[06:39:38] <d1> ... realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called “Linux”, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program allocates the machine’s resources to 
[06:39:38] <d1> the other programs that you run. The kernel is an ...
[06:39:38] <d1> ... essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU//Linux. All the so-called “Linux” distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux.

[06:41:24] <d1> it can only function in the context of a complete Windows operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the Windows operating system: the whole system is basically Windows with Linux added, or WSL. All the so-called "Linux" apps are really flavors of WSL.

[06:44:29] <d1> I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as Linux, is in fact, Windows Subsystem for Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, WSL. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free app in the Microsoft Store and part of a fully functioning Windows system made useful by the Windows OS, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS 
[06:44:29] <d1> as defined by POSIX. 
[06:44:29] <d1> Many computer users run a modified version of the WSL system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of WSL which is widely used today is often called "Linux", and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the Windows system, developed by Microsoft. 
[06:44:29] <d1> There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the app: the program in the system that wastes the machine's resources to limit the other programs that you run. The app is an optional part of an operating system, but useless by itself, 
[06:44:29] <d1> it can only function in the context of a complete Windows operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the Windows operating system: the whole system is basically Windows with Linux added, or WSL. All the so-called "Linux" apps are really flavors of WSL.

[07:12:19] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> auto-rejoin is for people who like getting auto-banned
[07:12:37] <misspwn> mine was autojoin at one point but i messed it all up

[07:13:00] <dragonfleas> i'll google it

[07:13:02] <misspwn> hexchat is dumb with its setup
[07:13:03] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> unless you set your auto-rejoin to like 10 or 15 seconds
[07:13:16] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> it's a liability unless you set it per-channel
[07:13:35] <misspwn> there is a delay in ident and so it doesn't auto join although it should after ident *shrugs*
[07:14:42] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> then you get kicked for rejoining too fast, then eventually banned for join floody

[07:46:03] <gibby> enix: I fucking LOVE factorio 
[07:46:07] <PattyCakes> for example, we have 5 points per person per week, if we have a 4 person team then we can assume in a perfevct world, we can clean 20 points in a week
[07:46:09] <sd> 07<x​oxo> yeah, real non-comittal
[07:46:11] <enix> My production centers have gotten a lot better and im using the bus design much better right now
[07:46:22] <gibby> to the point where it becomes a problem heh
[07:46:23] <enix> idk how to handle inputs from outputs though
[07:46:26] <sd> 07<x​oxo> atlassian recommend something called "planning poker"
[07:46:32] <sd> 07<x​oxo> where you just give a random number
[07:46:38] <sd> 07<x​oxo> and the number most people come up with wins
[07:46:43] <PattyCakes> that's during the triage stage
[07:46:50] <sd> 07<x​oxo> or to quote their trainer "if you're going to define a story point as 8 hours why go through the hassle of calling it a story point, just call it 8 hours"
[07:47:02] <enix> Like I've got a 4 lane bus for the outputs of circuits, belts, undergrounds, splitters and yellow inserters but it doesn't scale later when I need to re-use these for stacks and stuff
[07:47:15] <enix> so idk do i make onsite or ship in.. idk
[07:47:19] <PattyCakes> because points are far braoder xoxo
[07:47:29] <PattyCakes> they mean what you make them mean
[07:47:35] <PattyCakes> not everyone does 5 points per week
[07:47:38] <PattyCakes> or 8 points per day
[07:47:46] <gibby> yeah, you left yourself no room to scale out on that
[07:47:59] <sd> 07<x​oxo> that's what I've done so far  "this task is 14 story points"

[07:48:36] <PattyCakes> see, you're also missing a major piece that makes scrum work
[07:48:41] <PattyCakes> no one should influence your story points
[07:49:01] <PattyCakes> someone submits request, request gets triaged, team decides points and capaicty, and THEN it gets worked

[07:52:32] <enix> I find a lot of info is super late mid game tho
[07:53:15] <gibby> right right, just saying. Don't pigeonhole yourself into figuring it out. Factorio optimizations are fucking VAST
[07:53:17] <PattyCakes> Pick an upper limit of "points" that the hardest most complext task you can think of would be. Say 500. Then your simplest task is say 350
[07:53:19] <enix> Oh the zigzag was for a little more buffer. It was midnight, I wasn't bothered to go nuts
[07:53:33] <gibby> learning a thing or two from the blueprints wont help
[07:53:58] <gibby> I assure you, once you settle in on a set of blueprints you wont leave them
[07:54:08] <gibby> you have far more to worry about in the long run
[07:54:19] <PattyCakes> and just start tracking tasks based on points. Commit to timelines all you want, but eventually you'll have enough data to look back at previously pointed tasks, and better account for future similar tasks

[16:50:31] <sintax> yeah that makes it hard. easy to leave a company but the relationships there are harder.
[16:50:47] <AnonymooseReddtr> the thing is
[16:50:59] <AnonymooseReddtr> We lost one other person ont he project to a great opportunity
[16:51:05] <AnonymooseReddtr> and the project team & boss was awesome about it
[16:51:10] <sintax> nice.
[16:51:29] <AnonymooseReddtr> he said he'd never fault someone for leaving for a better opportunity and just wants to be able to transition work in progress

[22:19:09] <vinrock> it aparenty shot up and punched a hole in the clouds

[22:52:58] <CableNinja> I built an HA syncing solution that uses git on the backend and inotify for watching the files

[23:55:57] <sd> 08<a​bakedapplepie> @Sobia i dont know?
[23:56:07] <sd> 08<a​bakedapplepie> i guessing not
[23:56:12] <sd> 08<a​bakedapplepie> what is that
[23:56:21] <sd> 08<a​bakedapplepie> are they gating critical security patches?!
[23:56:21] <sd> 12<S​obia> In the article you sent, it's the first thing under "how to get this update"
[23:56:26] <sd> 12<S​obia> It's been EoL'd
[23:56:40] <sd> 08<a​bakedapplepie> they released mitigations for the side channel shit

[23:57:21] <sd> 09<Q​uasky> But only if you have the extended service agreement? Or is for all?
[23:57:27] <meme> what's that tool to block countries from attempting connections to my endpoints again?
[23:57:35] <meme> i can't remember the name of it
[23:57:37] <sd> 12<S​obia> I'm only stating this because the article on how to get the update stated you need it

[23:57:57] <sd> 08<a​bakedapplepie> i cant imagine they would restrict a patch as critical as this to paying extended support users
[23:58:11] <sd> 08<a​bakedapplepie> they havent done that for other high vulnerabilities
[23:58:14] <CptLuxx> i hope they do
[23:58:18] <CptLuxx> get of your shitty eol servers
[23:58:20] <sd> 12<S​obia> You would be wrong. MS doesn't *want* to support those older OSs
[23:58:25] <sd> 12<S​obia> And rightfully so, to be fair.
[23:58:27] <sd> 08<a​bakedapplepie> they already supported it though
[23:58:31] <sd> 08<a​bakedapplepie> the patch already exists
[23:58:35] <CptLuxx> then pay for it
[23:59:01] <sd> 08<a​bakedapplepie> 🙄  youre missing my point lol they havent done this with any other recent high profile high potential exploits
[23:59:23] <CptLuxx> yeah and it was wrong
[23:59:30] <signofzeta> Try enabling TLS 1.2 (if 2008 R1 supported that).
[23:59:34] <sd> 12<S​obia> I'm not too concerned with the other high profile and high potential exploits necessarily. Since the first line in the "how to get the update" states you need this - MS makes you need it
[23:59:46] <signofzeta> That might have been Windows Server 2008 Foundation, a super-low-end SKU with limitations.
