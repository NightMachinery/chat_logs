[16:36:25] <whupdup> I've tried just letting it get laid out normally, and using divs per column, but I can't find a way to both maintain tight packing *and* have things fold together in my preferred order when the screen narrows
[16:37:54] *** Quits: georgios (~georgios@user/georgios) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[16:37:56] <whupdup> Essentially I'm trying to maintain 2, 50% columns that fill left-to-right but can fold into 1, 100% column in smaller widths
[16:48:40] <hmw[at]> whupdup: check out @media queries
[16:49:03] <hmw[at]> (or find some magical flex parameter, I don't flex much myself, so I don't know)
[16:50:42] <whupdup> Yeah I've gotten the part where I get it to fold conditionally figured out
[16:50:54] <whupdup> It's just that I can't maintain my desired order and layout in double-collumn mode
[16:53:24] <hmw[at]> You may need to study flex closely, before continuing on this. Maybe this helps whupdup https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/
[16:54:08] <hmw[at]> ...or wait for someone who knows flex to show up
[16:54:53] <whupdup> I didn't even know about flex lol, let me read up on it
[16:56:33] <hmw[at]> It shouldn't be too hard. I have just been to lazy to read up on it properly and do some practice. I am not afraid of a float :)

[20:26:36] <hmw[at]> whupdup: Something I cobbled together a while ago. Perhaps it is useful to you: https://harald.ist.org/paste/columns.html
[20:28:17] <whupdup> Sorry I don't have anything to host this from atm but: https://files.catbox.moe/yg91wn.png essentially my problem is vertical packing of unequal column boxes such that they're ordered by row, but packed by column
[20:28:38] <whupdup> and the idea is that they're ordered by row so that on smaller sizes, it will order a single column correctly with the most important stuff at the top
[20:28:43] <whupdup> and I want this to work w/o any scripts
[20:28:58] <hmw[at]> sure. This is #css master race after all :)
[20:29:05] <whupdup> I tried float + vertical-align, as well as flex stuff
[20:29:11] <whupdup> and both have this same particular limitation
[20:29:46] <whupdup> the limitation that I can't break up the end-line of a row
[20:30:17] <hmw[at]> whupdup: https://jsfiddle.net/ <-- put your _reduced_ test cases here if we should inspect code
[20:30:20] <hmw[at]> whupdup: Hmm
[20:30:27] <hmw[at]> Kind of a top align missing, is that the issue?
[20:31:13] <hmw[at]> You shouldn't ask me. I'd use float and accept funny looks from the kids
[20:32:18] <hmw[at]> whupdup: This channel can be slow at times. Let me also recommend you stick around until other people get active
[20:36:10] *** Rockwood_ is now known as Rockwood
[20:36:21] <hmw[at]> whupdup: I do not yet fully understand, where your trouble lies though. https://jsfiddle.net/5ns1dzak/ <-- this roughly what you want?
[20:37:36] <Rockwood> more better grid in this case
[20:38:39] <hmw[at]> Not sure, if grid is the way to go here. Perhaps you can scroll back and check, if you can help. I am not good with flex at all
[20:38:42] <hmw[at]> Rockwood: ^
[20:39:25] <hmw[at]> also, not yet sure, what whup'dup is trying to accomplish. Waiting for an answer rn.
[20:40:24] <Rockwood> yeah grid is prefect for this

[20:49:09] <whupdup> No that's kinda the same problem, https://jsfiddle.net/nj31vg0x/

[20:59:03] <whupdup> Yeah that definitely gets the shape right, but not the order. I'm trying to make a portfolio site/blog where I have 2 major columns with blocks of varying height but they can fold into 1 on mobile
[20:59:25] <whupdup> and I need to keep the order row-major to have the most important stuff stay relative to the top of the view
[20:59:32] <hmw[at]> argh. I guess I should learn how to look lol
[20:59:57] <whupdup> I can't believe I ran into a massive CSS limitation so fast
[21:00:17] <hmw[at]> Hm. That might not be possible, unless one can change the order like with grids.

[21:01:31] <hmw[at]> So, where are my flexy friends, who could do it in 5 seconds?
[21:01:34] <hmw[at]> Interesting problem though
[21:02:57] <hmw[at]> whupdup: folding into one is easy with @media, unless you find a better way
[21:03:06] <whupdup> Oh yeah, I do the folding part easily
[21:03:09] <Rockwood> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::backdrop work with only dialog?
[21:03:26] <whupdup> the problem lies entirely with keeping the row-major order in 2-column mode but also keeping that vertical packing
[21:04:16] <hmw[at]> whupdup: A problem with this requirement is that you want to mix rows and columns kind of; What should the layout engine do, if 2 is taller than 1+3 combined, etc.
[21:05:46] <hmw[at]> There is at least some more information needed, e.g. "All columns shall have the same number of elements, and all should be crunched to the top" or so
[21:07:08] <hmw[at]> You can cheat perhaps. Like ordering the elements differently (1, 3, 2, 4) or ensuring they all get roughly the same size and then use a rectangular grid without "crunching", ...
[21:07:39] <whupdup> that's true, I wonder if I can change the order easily with media queries
[21:08:02] <hmw[at]> With media query you would select for "small screen size", and then switch over to grid; With grid is is super easy
[21:08:35] <hmw[at]> easy to move the elements around

[21:10:51] <hmw[at]> Rockwood: Is that a request for help?
[21:11:43] <Rockwood> actually i am using first time backdrop
[21:11:46] <Rockwood> yes
[21:11:52] <hmw[at]> ic
[21:12:27] <Rockwood> i am placing wrongly backdrop i think

[21:13:02] <hmw[at]> wth is ::backdrop. Asking the almighty search engine :)
[21:13:31] <Rockwood> very less people used it i think
[21:13:43] <whupdup> hmm, I guess I could put a media query into the style attribute of each object, and have it set its `order`
[21:13:57] <whupdup> do media queries work inside an html style attribute
[21:14:28] <hmw[at]> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::backdrop
[21:14:32] <hmw[at]> hmm... fullscreen??
[21:15:09] <hmw[at]> whupdup: You don't want to ever use inline styles for a bunch of reasons. Use proper CSS instead. @media probably not working in a style attr
[21:15:11] <Rockwood> no
[21:18:42] <hmw[at]> Rockwood: " rendered immediately beneath any element being presented in full-screen mode"
[21:18:52] <hmw[at]> I think they mean things like fullscreen videos etc
[21:19:09] <Rockwood> i don't want close popup by outside click
[21:19:17] <Rockwood> just this is my concern

[21:25:19] <Rockwood> hmw[at], .lightbox:target { similar as you suggested
[21:25:29] <hmw[at]> Needs some tweaking of course. I think I would need a wrapper for vertical centering, like so: https://jsfiddle.net/u5wkh21y/1/

[21:27:07] <hmw[at]> using a background color should prevent clicking items behind it
[21:28:20] <hmw[at]> hm. not even necessary

[21:29:40] <hmw[at]> Rockwood: For preventing clicks outside the modal window, you'd have to extend my example by an inner box (the window itself). The outer ".modal" div is there to catch everything, hence it is 100% wide and tall

[21:31:58] <Rockwood> so backdrop, is not requires for this thing?
[21:32:51] <hmw[at]> required? There are certainly other ways to set a background. Also, it seems to be for fullscreen videos and such things, not "normal" styling

[21:38:38] <hmw[at]> you can't make an html element fullscreen, unless it is some special thing like said video elements
