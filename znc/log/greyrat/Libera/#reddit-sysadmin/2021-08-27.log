[00:42:01] <signofzeta> is there a DHCP option for assigning a VLAN to a client?  Someone plugged the phones into the main LAN.  They're on a tagged port if we can just reconfigure 50 phones at once.
[00:43:22] <DomLS3> signofzeta: 43 usually gives vlan tags for IP phones. May work for computers as well
[00:47:22] <signofzeta> oh wait, we can have the vendor re-write the configuration files.  that might be easier.

[10:33:56] <sd> 05<N​ick1296> So I finally recovered the SSD corrupted by the Chineseium M.2 adapter (put it into a USB3 one without interference)... All I'm seeing is garbage.
[10:33:58] <sd> 05<N​ick1296> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/407265509931745281/880694106161053696/unknown.png
[10:35:08] <Cl0udNinja> the data is there, but the filenames were lost
[10:35:26] <sd> 05<N​ick1296> So maybe let it run, but I need to filter it.
[10:35:42] <Cl0udNinja> try recovering with PhotoRec
[10:36:16] <sd> 05<N​ick1296> But you can see why I was beginning to ask if I'm wasting time
[10:36:41] <Cl0udNinja> photorec might get you some better results
[10:36:53] <Cl0udNinja> its pretty good at recovering even shit I thought was long gone
[10:36:56] <JollyRgrs> PhotoRec++
[10:37:09] <JollyRgrs> recovered some stuff from corrupt SD card with that, can recommend
[10:37:12] <sd> 05<N​ick1296> So maybe not a total waste yet, but yeah Dell's BIOS might be taking it for lunch
[10:37:25] <JollyRgrs> but in general, if you've never done any type of recovery stuff before... it isn't usually ezpz 123
[10:37:45] <sd> 05<N​ick1296> I have, but this was more like a hold my beer I have nothing to lose one
[10:38:06] <Cl0udNinja> idk if photorec will recover an SSD, but who knows
[10:38:06] <JollyRgrs> what are you wanting to get from this recovery?
[10:38:27] <sd> 05<N​ick1296> Seeing what I can do to recover from the corruption.
[10:38:39] <JollyRgrs> Cl0udNinja: i mean, it's the same functionality, it's just trying to find old partition tables, and if not, it looks for file headers, etc.
[10:38:48] <JollyRgrs> photorec should even work on old HDDs iirc
[10:38:49] <Cl0udNinja> right
[10:39:07] <Cl0udNinja> but SSDs dont have magnetic data that can be re-read from because of reminent data
[10:39:16] <JollyRgrs> usually an SSD just dies... but if he can read from it, it isn't (most likely) the medium that failed, but something like the controller
[10:39:27] <JollyRgrs> right, but things aren't awlays written over
[10:39:33] <Cl0udNinja> true
[10:39:33] <sd> 05<N​ick1296> Maybe the controller on the SSD adapter, likely.
[10:39:33] <JollyRgrs> there are backup file tables, etc.
[10:39:43] <JollyRgrs> and photorec isn't going to the "faint magnetic data"
[10:39:50] <JollyRgrs> that's more like... heavy forensic recovery
[10:40:21] <sd> 05<N​ick1296> Think it's the controller on the SSD adapter, or the SSD itself?
[10:40:46] <JollyRgrs> no clue, i had some bad file corruption (looked like bit rot) due to REALLY cheap rounded IDE cables back in the day
[10:41:09] *** Quits: riff-IRC (~riff-IRC@user/riff-irc) (Remote host closed the connection)
[10:41:10] <JollyRgrs> so i mean... there's plenty of things that take data from machine memory to whatever storage you are using... anything could go wrong

[13:01:33] <Joe-Developer> I thought they where one time use!!
[13:01:46] <xe0n> so anyway...you've bought 100 of these things and they suck?
[13:01:53] <nobyk> well no
[13:01:58] <Joe-Developer> skip to the good bit
[13:02:00] <nobyk> not yet
[13:02:03] <xe0n> right
[13:02:12] <nobyk> I was just asking
[13:02:16] <Joe-Developer> we did that with microsoft dock 2's
[13:02:17] <nobyk> if any of yall got some
[13:02:19] <xe0n> do they support display port?
[13:02:23] <Joe-Developer> they have shit IO and compatibility
[13:02:27] <xe0n> oh man the docks for surface books suckkk
[13:02:29] <xe0n> not enough juice
[13:02:32] <xe0n> dock2 i think fixed that
[13:02:43] <Joe-Developer> dock 2 doesn't play nice with external displays
[13:02:45] <xe0n> but the one i have...i got it from work because...it didnt work with the surface book
[13:02:48] <xe0n> worked okay with my spro sooo
[13:02:55] <xe0n> pos
[13:03:00] <xe0n> dell docks were good
[13:03:04] <Joe-Developer> they don't have DP or HDMI or anything built into the dock, only usb C for display capabilities 
[13:03:09] <xe0n> i used one yesterday, worked fine
[13:03:13] <xe0n> oh lame
[13:03:15] <xe0n> lame lame lame
[13:03:25] <xe0n> i do not recommend the dock...
[13:03:28] <xe0n> the ms one
[13:03:28] <Joe-Developer> you have to buy expensive usb c dongles to work
[13:03:28] <xe0n> lol
[13:03:36] <xe0n> oh lameoooo
[13:03:39] <Joe-Developer> coz we have docks in every classroom and a big touchscreen 
[13:03:57] <Joe-Developer> went through 10 different usb-c dongles before one worked flawlessly
[13:04:39] <xe0n> what a pain in the ass
[13:04:52] <Joe-Developer> very much
[13:05:00] <xe0n> annndddd thennn
[13:05:08] <Joe-Developer> and theeeeeeeeen
[13:05:23] <Joe-Developer> Dude where's my car??
[13:05:37] <Joe-Developer> LOL
[13:05:40] <Joe-Developer> anyway
[13:06:07] <Joe-Developer> 3 of the dongles looked the exact same, but only 1 of them worked
[13:06:17] <Joe-Developer> so we got big confusion
[13:06:33] <Joe-Developer> now we're slowly replacing them with a usbc to hdmi cable we found that works very well
[13:06:45] <Joe-Developer> because half of the dongles stopped working over summer for no reason at all
[13:09:13] <xe0n> chinese junk
[13:09:22] <Joe-Developer> legit
[13:09:36] <xe0n> when i had to look after surface stuff the dongles we got were premium ones
[13:09:38] <xe0n> so they worked okay
[13:09:44] <Joe-Developer> coz we didn't really have the funds to splash out another £40/dock for an adapter

[14:11:27] <sd> 09<h​ayden> That's pog
[14:12:02] <sd> 09<h​ayden> You would do that by setting `server_name` but not using `default_server` on the `listen` config

[14:15:26] <sd> 09<h​ayden> Could you share your site configs? Kinda hard to help when we don't know how you've configured it 🙂
[14:17:38] <sd> 09<E​nergy Drink Girl> heres the config for the one that will use a certificate:

[14:23:02] <sd> 09<E​nergy Drink Girl> but how do I avoid that
[14:23:02] <sd> 09<h​ayden> Your default.conf isn't listening on SSL so Nginx might be grabbing the first SSL cert it finds configured
[14:23:36] <sd> 09<h​ayden> You would have to configure default.conf for SSL or stop trying to connect to other hosts over SSL
[14:23:38] <sd> 09<E​nergy Drink Girl> other domains are prompted with certificate errors because it is not for them
[14:24:01] <sd> 09<h​ayden> Yeah, I think it's because you only have one site listening on port 443
[14:24:08] <sd> 09<h​ayden> So nginx is trying to load that configuration
[14:24:10] <sd> 09<h​ayden> Not your other one
[14:24:20] <sd> 09<h​ayden> So if you connect over http instead of https, you should be fine
[14:24:53] <Activ8> you usually set up a default domain so it can only get requests on the internal ip for example or external ip then you set up a virtual host that can be accepted on the domain via SSL.  Each domain would have it's own certificate set up in the config.

[15:46:46] <Activ8> fraud could easy be cut, but I have a feeling the banks don't want fraud to go away completely
[15:46:51] <Activ8> they could kill fraud over night
[15:47:12] <estranger> banks don't like fraud..
[15:47:40] <Activ8> I'm not convinced, I am more than positive they can cut fraud completely if they really tried
[15:48:03] <Activ8> fraud might be an insurance thing, fraud will be insured

[15:48:54] <estranger> they spend a ton on fraud... the problem is banks are mostly legacy #ystems still so integration of realtime detection at the scale and latency they need is not trivial

[19:49:54] <frostybrew> jesus christ
[19:49:54] <mistiry> removed the founders and successors and changed them all to freenode admins
[19:50:02] <mistiry> muted the channels
[19:50:07] <mistiry> and banned everyone
[19:50:14] <gibby> doesn't help they promoted a bunch of questionable people to IRCops
[19:50:34] <mistiry> Then, they started giving ownership back to any random joe-schmo that went in and asked for it
[19:50:44] <mistiry> So then you had tons of channels with new owners
[19:50:49] <frostybrew> lmao
[19:50:52] <mistiry> Very bad for the well-established communities
[19:51:08] <frostybrew> From what I am reading, it also caused a ton of squatter situations
[19:51:16] <mistiry> absolutely
[19:51:42] <mistiry> Then, they "welcomed discussion" but mass k-lined anyone that even asked a question about the situation 
[19:51:47] <frostybrew> Well it sounds like libera.chat is set up far better for the future of irc tbh
[19:52:12] <mistiry> Then, they decided to switch IRCd's with no proper plan or schedule
[19:52:31] <mistiry> At the same time, they willfully decided to leave the old nickserv and chanserv db's behind

[19:53:14] <frostybrew> I feel kinda dirty
[19:53:16] <mistiry> Delete it
[19:53:51] <mistiry> Luckily the libera folks were awesome for channels like us when it all went down
[19:54:07] <mistiry> We got set up here without any troubles and most of the user base, and all of the active users, made the switch.
[19:54:30] <frostybrew> What client is everyone using these days?
[19:54:34] <mistiry> weechat
[19:54:41] <frostybrew> I'm trying out TheLounge but I'm not 100% sold on it.
[19:54:41] <signofzeta> weechat
[19:55:05] <Activ8> What client is everyone using these days? - the lounge chat irc client for me
[19:55:06] <mistiry> i have a small VPS, and run tmux+weechat
[19:55:12] <Activ8> been running it since version 2
[19:56:36] <frostybrew> I can't even connect to irc.com to run the drop command and there's no way to delete account from their website
[19:56:37] <frostybrew> Amazingff
[19:56:37] <Activ8> libre.chat - There are 63 users and 46576 invisible on 26 servers
[19:57:05] <mistiry> Activ8: https://netsplit.de/networks/top10.php
[19:57:26] <mistiry> ^ what killing an IRC network looks like

[19:58:54] <a1> boomer
[19:58:58] <gibby> no u
[19:59:02] <mistiry> i only use tmux for weechat, screen i use for everything else
[19:59:03] <Activ8> this is the 90's we are still on IRC
[19:59:04] <a1> no u, and no u backs
[19:59:05] <Activ8> well some of us
[19:59:07] <gibby> D:
[19:59:41] <mistiry> ive had a custom screenrc file for so many years, it doesnt feel right if im not in my screen window
[19:59:47] <gibby> ^
[20:00:43] <Activ8> I suggest people give the lounge client a go if you know linux and have somewhere to put it
[20:00:45] <Activ8> it's fab
[20:00:58] <Activ8> I got free stickers and fridge magnets when I first joined
[20:01:13] <mistiry> with minor adjustments here and there, ive been using this screenrc file for at least 15 years
[20:01:48] <jr> i dicked around with weechat for a bit but it didn't seem worth it to relearn things
[20:01:59] <Activ8> I can't get away with any other client
[20:02:23] <Activ8> TLC suites my needs across multiple devices, saves chat logs automagically, and has scroll back logs
[20:02:32] <Activ8> can have public mode or private mode via login
[20:02:40] <mistiry> there was a brief period earlier this year where i was on hexchat because $lazy, but weehcat is great
[20:03:01] <Activ8> libre.chat should have used the lounge chat for their public client
[20:03:06] <iphone> you missed it @Colour?
[20:03:16] <mistiry> weechat saves logs, has scroll back, and since its on a VPS i can access it from anywhere i'm able to SSH into my VPS
[20:03:32] <jr> yep...same with irssi
[20:03:39] <jr> it's the perfect solution for me
[20:04:00] <Activ8> I don't like the client
[20:04:00] <mistiry> irssi is acceptable as well
[20:04:13] <Activ8> the lounge chat has css themes
[20:04:14] <mistiry> irssi is old school
[20:04:15] <jr> i'm guessing no one uses bitchx anymore
[20:04:28] <mistiry> well. "old school"
[20:04:34] <mistiry> irssi didnt exist when i started on IRC
[20:04:51] <iphone> when I first got on IRC, we didn't have no Libera
[20:04:51] *** glider_ is now known as glider
[20:04:54] <jr> i feel like if i was coming into it in 2021, i might just go with irccloud
[20:04:56] <mistiry> i imagine theres still some dedicated folks on bitchx
[20:05:04] <jr> yeah irssi didn't exist when i started either
[20:05:25] <jr> i first connected around 96/97...and it was pure mirc for a while
[20:05:29] <Activ8> I like how you can customize the notification sound in TLC and customize the theme via css
[20:05:32] <frostybrew> I've only really used irccloud and a glowing-bear solution in the past.
[20:05:47] <iphone> I only got started with IRC because work used it instead of slack or ms teams
[20:05:54] <Activ8> I have been running my own custom theme since v3
[20:05:56] <mistiry> first IRC client was Microsoft Comic Chat. then i learned about IRC and how it was just a client, and moved to mIRC
[20:06:04] <mistiry> some of the first scripting i even did was mirc scripts
[20:06:11] <jr> oh man...comic chat
[20:06:15] <mistiry> i learned a lot about logic and syntax from that
[20:06:18] <Activ8> I don't want bells and whistles in a client I just want text
[20:06:31] <Activ8> don't even need to connect it to a bouncer either, but that's optional
[20:06:47] <jr> yeah i had learned QBasic previously but i did a lot of mirc scripting
[20:07:02] <jr> i found one of my old scripts on a script hosting site a few years back
[20:07:20] <mistiry> i had done some batch and stuff, but really got into it with mirc scripts and went down the rabbit hole from there
[20:07:35] <frostybrew> Wow I just noticed TheLounge isn't keeping pretty much any logs, I can't scroll back but 30 minutes
[20:07:36] <Activ8> i used mirc for maybe a week then changed 
[20:07:42] <frostybrew> Kinda sucks
[20:07:48] <mistiry> i was on mirc for years
[20:07:50] <Activ8> that's done in settings frostybrew
[20:07:55] <Activ8> check the config file
[20:08:10] <jr> yeah i used mirc for a pretty long time...probably 7-8 years
[20:08:13] <Activ8> increase the amount of lines

[20:08:32] <jr> before jumping to irssi in the early/mid 2000s
[20:08:47] <mistiry> i didnt move to weechat until like 2010 LOL

[20:13:30] <mistiry> vinrock: oh does it require it now? i dont remember when i stopped with mirc. there was a period where i used something called pIRCh and also hexchat before finally going to weechat
[20:13:33] <vinrock> i like fedora
[20:13:39] <mistiry> it uesd to just be a nag screen
[20:13:42] <mistiry> or, get a cracked version
[20:13:45] <jr> yeah i like arch for running something that feels streamlined
[20:13:50] <jr> it could just be placebo effect
[20:13:52] <vinrock> yeah mistiry he started requiring it to be registered when it used to still install and just bark at you for money
[20:13:55] <jr> but i'll just continue believing it
[20:14:06] <signofzeta> After yet another Gentoo install landed in reverse dependency hell, I gave up and went to Ubuntu.  It's good enough for daily use.
[20:14:29] <jr> i think i actually used mint most recently....but i rarely fire up any of my laptops at home
[20:14:34] <iphone> every arch install was more creatively destroyed than the one before it. I probably went through 4-5 installs when I was learning linux
[20:14:35] <vinrock> Ill slap ubuntu on old folks' machines that run like shit
[20:14:48] <PublicWiFi> i try to run debian when I can
[20:14:49] <mistiry> mirc+nnscript if you wanna be 1337
[20:15:06] <jr> i always thought mirc+7th sphere 3.0 was the way
[20:15:07] <iphone> I tried that with my gf's Fischer Price $250 shit laptop, and it ran fine, but she just couldn't figure out how to use it
[20:15:29] <iphone> putting linux on non-tech poeple's laptops has always been a huge interpersonal struggle
[20:15:29] <Activ8> lol
[20:15:44] <vinrock> its not bad when the people just want to browse webpages
[20:15:49] <iphone> they sell these laptops that dont even run
[20:15:49] <frostybrew> I put Manjaro on my mom's machine, it never got used once after I showed it to her.

[20:17:53] <frostybrew> I swore off everything Apple, then work gave me a MacBook. Decided to try an iPhone for the first time. Instead of building my parents a PC with power they will never use, I should have just bought them a Mac mini tbh.
[20:18:00] <Activ8> did he have insurance mistiry
[20:18:27] <iphone> company bought me an iphone and macbook. I hated apple before, now I like them. Good products when I'm not paying for them. Though, for work, I still use linux 
[20:18:33] <mistiry> yeah he talks about it, theres insurance but theres question of what is covered and what isnt
[20:18:42] <iphone> the little differences between macos and linux are annoying though.
[20:18:44] <mistiry> also $ doesnt replace the items
[20:18:45] <vinrock> i have a basically brand new macbook pro that apple wont unlock for me
[20:18:47] <Activ8> it happens 
[20:18:51] <mistiry> oh i know
[20:18:55] <mistiry> i was in a house fire as a kid
[20:18:57] <vinrock> just got the t203 tool so i can reqrite the ecurity chip
[20:19:01] <frostybrew> vinrock dont steal them 4head
[20:19:03] <frostybrew> kekw
[20:19:04] <mistiry> sucks though
[20:19:24] <vinrock> house fire
[20:19:28] <Activ8> I was a kid who used to play with fires was so fascinated by them
[20:19:29] <vinrock> thats a good wy to get traumatized
[20:19:39] <Activ8> always kept away from lighters n matches
[20:19:49] <vinrock> i think from the age of like 12-15 al i did was light shit on fire
[20:20:06] <mistiry> vinrock: meh, maybe i was old enough but im not really traumatized. i even ran into a burning apartment once later in life to help get people out and put out the fire
[20:20:23] <vinrock> wtf why are you around so much fire
[20:20:29] <mistiry> i was...hmm 11 or 12 i think when our house was on fire
[20:20:36] <frostybrew> I'm started to question all of the fires Ive seen in person
[20:20:38] <frostybrew> Was mistiry there?
[20:20:40] <iphone> kid in my school got expelled for lighting a whole matchbook and he threw the smoldering book in the trash when it went out
[20:20:41] <vinrock> ikr
[20:20:49] <vinrock> that kids a dummy
[20:20:57] <iphone> almost started a dumpster fire. This school had < 100 kids so it was big news
[20:20:57] <vinrock> school smokebombs you use tin foil and oven cleaner
[20:21:02] <PublicWiFi> tfw your script keeps failing cause you named a .json .jason on accident
[20:21:03] <vinrock> crush it into a bal and toss into the corner f a room
[20:21:04] <mistiry> the apartment was when i was like 19 or 20, and it was a neighboring apartment who cooked something in the oven that spilled out and caught fire
[20:21:04] <Activ8> lol
[20:21:32] <vinrock> we set a farmers field on fire
[20:21:35] <vinrock> that shit was dope
[20:21:35] <Activ8> I'm all out of monster munch just gone through two big packets
[20:21:54] <mistiry> maybe it taught me to appreciate fire more
[20:21:55] <mistiry> idk
[20:21:56] <iphone> mistiry: watch kingcobrajfs cook on youtube. its astounding how he hasn't burned his kitchen down. so many inept people cook greasy shit and start fires
[20:22:31] <mistiry> you gotta respect the fire. i was always in charge of the fire when camping.
[20:22:43] <mistiry> just like anything in nature, you have to learn to work WITH it, not against it
[20:22:50] <Activ8> I don't play with fires like I used to I grew out of it
[20:22:57] <vinrock> you must become one with the fire
[20:23:15] <Activ8> hehe
[20:23:35] <vinrock> i love read only friday
[20:23:43] <frostybrew> This conversation is steering towards The Lord of Light
[20:23:45] <frostybrew> and I'm worried
[20:24:14] <Activ8> no no no no lord of the lights
[20:24:17] <Activ8> plzzzzzzzzzz
[20:24:23] <mistiry> vinrock: more like you have to understand how they work and behave, so you can work around it. cuz you're not gonna make IT work around YOU.
[20:24:36] <mistiry> if you become one with the fire, youre doing it wrong. also youre burning.
[20:24:38] <Activ8> I'm having a cuppa tea before my mate comes to pick me up, off out food shopping
[20:25:03] <frostybrew> Becoming one with the fire isn't so much different than working in IT tbh.
[20:25:23] <Activ8> usually IT are the ones putting out the flames
[20:25:29] <frostybrew> Keeping your sanity and handling the forces of nature around the office/company, in order to keep it from all burning down.
