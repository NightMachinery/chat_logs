[16:04:16] <de-facto> Hi I had a weird problem: i am using ZNC over socat to use the TOR hidden service of libera and it all worked fine but suddenly i had an issue with repeated disconnects (from client) and then got a network ban for repeated part/join. How can i find out where the problem is to avoid that from happening again?
[16:04:42] <de-facto> I did not change any settings and was just chatting at that moment in time
[16:05:22] <MetaNova> I saw that
[16:05:23] <MetaNova> * Quits: de-facto (~de-facto@user/de-facto) (K-Lined)
[16:05:39] <de-facto> basically i just want to find out what went wrong and avoid that from happening again
[16:05:46] <MetaNova> de-facto: well
[16:06:04] <MetaNova> there is one thing I think you should look at, specifically
[16:06:09] <MetaNova> the timeout setting in ZNC
[16:06:40] <MetaNova> de-facto: /msg *controlpanel get NoTrafficTimeout $me
[16:06:49] <MetaNova> it should return 180, the default
[16:07:14] <MetaNova> this is lower than Libera's network-side defined timeout. you should set this to something higher, like 300
[16:07:27] <MetaNova> ( /msg *controlpanel set NoTrafficTimeout $me 300 )
[16:08:09] <de-facto> hmm i dont have a module controlpanel
[16:08:20] <MetaNova> then /msg *status loadmod controlpanel
[16:08:29] <MetaNova> or /msg *status loadmod --type=global controlpanel
[16:09:06] <de-facto> hmm
[16:09:55] <de-facto> <*controlpanel> NoTrafficTimeout = 180
[16:10:26] <MetaNova> yes, ZNC disconnects after 3 minutes (180 seconds) of no traffic
[16:10:27] <de-facto> can i set that globally in a config file?
[16:10:53] <de-facto> but i think the join/parts were repeatedly in short sequencec
[16:10:59] <MetaNova> de-facto: it's a per-user value. do not edit the conf by hand. the 'set' command I supplied will define it for your user
[16:11:05] <MetaNova> (and consequently all networks for that user)
[16:11:27] <de-facto> i have other users too on the same instance though
[16:11:41] <MetaNova> as an admin user you can set it for them, as well
[16:11:48] <MetaNova> just replace "$me" with their username
[16:12:00] <de-facto> can i set the default somewhere?
[16:12:27] <MetaNova> so that each new user created will inherit your defined value for NoTrafficTimeout?
[16:12:32] <MetaNova> not that I'm aware of
[16:12:41] <MetaNova> I believe that would require source code change
[16:13:10] <de-facto> oh ok hmm i dont want to recompile now
[16:14:15] <de-facto> where can i set that on the webui?
[16:14:29] <MetaNova> hm. I don't often use webadmin, one sec
[16:14:47] <MetaNova> ah
[16:14:58] <MetaNova> de-facto: "Your Settings" and scroll nearly all the way to the bottom
[16:15:04] <MetaNova> "Timeout before reconnect:"
[16:15:12] <de-facto> ah that thanks
[16:15:15] <MetaNova> np
[16:15:30] <de-facto> (i have an admin user but no irc connection for him, i only use the webui)
[16:15:36] <MetaNova> got it
[16:17:02] <de-facto> btw i had another user with 180 that did not have that problem
[16:17:28] <de-facto> i set them all to 300 now, but can it possibly be something else causing an endless sequence of part/join ?
[16:17:41] <MetaNova> to be fair, the tor connection can flake out at times
[16:17:57] <MetaNova> which is not your, ZNC's, or the network's fault
[16:18:19] <MetaNova> you're subject to whatever routes through the tor network get severed, for whatever reason, and need to re-established
[16:18:22] <de-facto> according to the netops my connection was stable at that time though
[16:18:44] <de-facto> could autocycle go berserk if it thinks it sees no users or such?
[16:18:52] <MetaNova> *shrug* you'd have to ask the libera staff in #libera about what further information you might be able to obtain
[16:19:59] <de-facto> the autocycle module was enabled, but from my understanding it just should do *one* part/join cycle if it sees no other users
[16:20:24] <MetaNova> I haven't personally ever seen autocycle flake out like that
[16:20:33] <MetaNova> but my connection is generally more reliable than one through tor
[16:21:27] <de-facto> something connection related was going on that that time, i had repeated resyncs with HExchat and could not get messages through
[16:22:06] <de-facto> it just does that sometimes, hexchat reconnecting and replaying everything, i never found out why
[16:22:24] <de-facto> (on the client side)
[16:22:42] <de-facto> but according to others the network (server) side was stable at that moment
[16:22:49] <de-facto> i cant verify because i only see the client side
[16:33:32] <de-facto> ok removed all autocycle and raised that timeout to 300 for all users
[16:33:39] <de-facto> idk what else i can to now

[22:15:16] <Error> hiya where i can view "Never logged in" user list without the webpanel?
[22:18:52] <MetaNova> Error: /msg *lastseen show
[22:22:27] <Error> thanks 
[22:24:15] <Error> but i was wondering as /moddata/lastseen/.registry has got all the lastseen user list, if there is one for Never logged in ones
[22:25:02] <MetaNova> a separate list of only users who have never logged in?
[22:25:05] <MetaNova> no
[22:25:08] <Error> yeah
[22:25:09] <MetaNova> I don't believe there is
[22:25:22] <MetaNova> otherwise just grep the file if you really want that info
[22:26:18] <Error> i have found the lastseen list but cannot find the never logged in ones 
[22:27:21] <Error> im think how the web panel shows it..it must be stored somewhere
[22:27:23] <Error> ;)
[22:27:41] <MetaNova> ok
