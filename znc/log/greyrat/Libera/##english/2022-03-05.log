[05:05:23] <Hazza> WHat is this type of light called?
[05:06:04] <Hazza> https://onlinelighting.com.au/images/detailed/144/CINEMA-Table-Lamp.jpg
[05:06:19] <Hazza> Studio Light, Uplight, Film Light, FLoodlight?
[05:06:26] <bin> it is a cinema table lamp
[05:06:33] <bin> as the file name says
[05:07:46] <Hazza> Sure, but is that the common name? I am labeling lighting on a home diagram and I was pondering the best name to describe large floodlights like these?
[05:08:00] <bin> I think it's really just a table lamp
[05:08:10] <bin> that's got a fun design to look like a theater lamp
[05:08:40] <bin> Hazza: wait are you referring to this particular item or that style of flood light
[05:08:54] <Hazza> style
[05:09:58] <bin> ahh ok
[05:10:05] <bin> It's a flood light
[05:10:14] *** Joins: solveig (sid194105@id-194105.uxbridge.irccloud.com)
[05:10:19] <Hazza> Ok so in general lights on tripod = flood light?
[05:10:29] <bin> no
[05:10:40] <bin> there's no one word for a light on a tripod
[05:11:08] <bin> !d floodlight
[05:11:10] <tinsoldier> floodlight — Noun: 1. A projector of a bright beam of light for use in theatres and studios; a flood, 2. (chiefly in the plural) Powerful artificial illumination with a broad beam, especially in a series of units on pylons used to illuminate a sports ground., — Verb: 1. (transitive) To enlighten or illuminate with floodlight(s). https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/floodlight
[05:11:11] <Hazza> So what would you use when labeling them in a home automation setup
[05:11:29] <bin> Hazza: a floodlight but not because it's on a tripod
[05:11:45] <bin> but because it projects a bright beam of light and "floods" the area with light
[05:12:00] <Hazza> There are 7 of them in this boutique home, and it makes it difficult as the outdoor lights are called "floodlights" in the HMI
[05:12:17] <Hazza> The central SCADA already has 7 entities named floodlight

[05:12:41] <bin> i think it's still accurate tbh
[05:12:45] <Hazza> I was thinking Cinema Light or Studio Lamp?
[05:12:53] <bin> studio lamp works
[05:15:08] <Hazza> Does this sound appropriate?  Doll Room Studio Light, Observatory Studio Light & Fitting Room Studio Light
[05:15:29] <Hazza> That's how it will show on the main HMI panel of the client
[05:18:39] <bin> I think that sounds good. I don't know if it's accurate from a technical jargon perspective but it makes sense to me.

[05:47:53] <kurahaupo> Apropos gneeriiloeepdeep's question; for me the "s" in "horse" is /s/ while the "s" in "whores" is /z/. Also the vowel length is different, like "ferry" vs "fairy", but that can get lost in rapid speech. And my dialect is non-rhotic, so in both cases the "r" is a silent vowel modifier. Does anyone else have /ho
[05:50:37] <kurahaupo> Does anyone else have /hɔs/ vs /hɔɔz/ ?

[06:48:42] <blacked> :O  =L  strange
[06:49:44] <basuotoko> Try not using them, but yeah, you would need to understand them.
[06:49:58] <blacked> basuotoko , what about the naked ess, is it ok to wear mini skirt or wear bikini as i see with nicki-minaj and things , publicly everywhere.
[06:50:33] <basuotoko> It is a type of culture.
[06:50:41] <blacked> :O
[06:50:45] <basuotoko> It is okay to see different cultures.
[06:51:43] <basuotoko> It would be hard to explain all of those when you are not put in the cuklture.
[06:52:01] <basuotoko> You are imaging them based on your culture, which shocking you no problem.
[06:52:54] <blacked> :)  no i'm not on those culture , but everything is changing now , bikinis and mini skirt (mini i mean mini , not short) are also working in myculture it X-P
[06:53:13] <basuotoko> blacked, It is like, It is a magic how well they could handle forks while i can only deal with chopsticks.
[06:53:28] <basuotoko> You are in the culture by yourself, you get used to them.
[06:53:44] <blacked> basuotoko china? where are you from?
[06:53:56] <blacked> chopstick i'vent tried :)
[06:54:00] <blacked> but i want to
[06:54:02] <basuotoko> bikini are very popular.
[06:54:22] <basuotoko> but in different nations wearings are based on their own culture a bit.
[06:54:54] <blacked> In the future , only sex sells i'm 100% sure.
[06:55:15] <basuotoko> blacked, put it in this way, imagine when we are all naked, we are the same, almost.
[06:55:38] <basuotoko> so based on that, we put some clouths for ourselves, hence bikini and so on, why strange? nothing.
[06:55:50] <blacked> but i get horny :(
[06:56:01] <basuotoko> That is normal.
[06:56:35] <basuotoko> If mens are losing interests on women and so on, this world is going to be fxxxed.
[06:57:10] <basuotoko> but we have morals thus even when you are thinking you are getting horny by the objects around you, you hvae to control yourself. simple.
[06:57:27] <basuotoko> but you do not feel shame about it. by all of those happening to you.
[06:58:25] <basuotoko> blacked, It is like when you are feeel guilty and so on, uncomfortable, you pray to God ro whatever you believe in. To free your soul and get cued.

[11:35:38] <GuiToris> I probably heard this in a song or in an interview. What does 'You are so caught up' mean?
[11:35:50] <GuiToris> -I can't provide any context because I don't remember the source-
[11:38:12] <snappy> you are so caught up in x - means you're consumed in x that you're not being attentive to things outside of x
[11:38:19] <snappy> i think.
[11:40:35] <GuiToris> what you are saying is actually the closest thing to the videos that I've been watched
[11:41:03] <GuiToris> I couldn't find this meaning in the dictionary, I found 5 meaning they are:
[11:41:11] <GuiToris> 1. to improve and reach the same standard as other people in your class, group etc
[11:41:19] <GuiToris> 2. to come from behind and reach someone in front of you by going faster
[11:41:25] <GuiToris> 3. to do what needs to be done because you have not been able to do it until now
[11:41:32] <GuiToris> 4. to spend time finding out what has been happening while you have been away or during the time you have not seen someone
[11:41:38] <GuiToris> 5. be/get caught up in something to be or get involved in something, especially something bad
[11:42:00] <GuiToris> is this supposed to be the 5th?
[11:42:06] <snappy> yeah #5 seems to fit the bill
[11:42:24] <GuiToris> thank you for helping :)
[11:43:16] <snappy> i think while #5 makes sense, it describes being involved in something, but i think there's an element of being consumed by something that you're inattentive to anything else
[11:43:39] <snappy> also i'm not sure if it's involved in something bad
[11:44:46] <GuiToris> yes, that's exactly why I was uncertain, I can't remember they were involved in a bad situation
[11:45:03] <GuiToris> maybe I should look for another dictionary
[11:45:13] <GuiToris> !d catch up
[11:45:15] <tinsoldier> catch up — Noun: 1. Alternative spelling of catch-up, — Verb: 1. (transitive) To pick up suddenly., 2. (transitive) To entangle., 3. (intransitive) To be brought up to date with news., 4. (transitive) To bring (someone) up to date with the news. https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/catch_up
[11:46:01] <GuiToris> !more
[11:46:02] <tinsoldier> There is no more.
[11:46:19] <GuiToris> ok, this was worse

[19:22:21] <mizzunet> which is correct grammer?
[19:23:35] <TimMc> "seems not to be" or "does not seem to be"
[19:25:15] <mizzunet> 👍️
[19:25:28] <TimMc> You need the -s to go with the singular subject.
[19:25:43] <mizzunet> Right
[19:25:47] <mizzunet> I always miss that
[19:25:50] <TimMc> And to have a "not" in front of the main verb, you need a do/does.
[19:26:13] <TimMc> In "seems not to be" the not is in front of the infinitive instead. :-)

[21:58:15] <jemius> blkshp, öhm, nope :( ^^
[21:59:37] <ln> jemius: "one" begins with a consonant, so it obviously requires "an" in front of it, like all other nouns that begin with a consonant.
[21:59:57] <zanfilap> ln: "a"

[22:01:57] <ln> jemius: it's pronounced /wʌn/, isn't w a consonant?
[22:02:25] <ln> you wouldn't say "an watch"
[22:03:52] <zanfilap> the voiced labial-velar approximant takes "a" in front of it if necessary
[22:04:29] <blkshp> It's not on the letter it starts with it's about the sound it starts with.
[22:06:10] <zanfilap> You say "a one dollar bill", not "an"
[22:06:46] <zanfilap> The approximant [w] is considered equivalent of a consonant.
[22:07:25] <zanfilap> Before a consonant, the indefinite article is "a".
[22:07:56] <zanfilap> Before a vowel, the indefinite article is "an".
