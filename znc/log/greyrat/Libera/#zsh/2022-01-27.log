[00:17:08] <phy1729> could be zprofile or zshenv or the environment you inherited

[00:22:10] <ph88> i don't know where the zprofile, zshenv or environment would be coming from
[00:22:31] <phy1729> There are also global version of the files in /etc or /etc/zsh
[00:22:42] <ph88> ok ill have a look there
[00:23:03] <Mikachu> login or whatever might also set a PATH before starting the login shell
[00:23:51] <ph88> maybe this  source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh 
[00:24:07] <ph88> eh no that cant be it .. because i echo $PATH before that line

[18:07:32] <Mikachu> it would be cool if you could call the lexer on a string and get the tokens back, rather than having to reimplement everything
[18:08:33] <danielsh> agreed.  And I put that in the topic of #zsyh :) 
[18:10:01] <danielsh> this case specifically is handled in subst.c, though, not lex.c
[18:10:17] <Mikachu> right
[18:10:19] <danielsh> I might tell phy1729 the line number after he's implemented this.  I don't want him to read the comments there :)

[20:20:57] <Voidwarper> can someone help me with zsh syntax? i am sourcing this script i made and it works for bash, but in zsh it creates 100 option select menu
[20:20:59] <Voidwarper> https://dpaste.com/BKQ428NWV
[20:22:59] <phy1729> I would change to eval "$(your_script)" so the script is a single language and not a polyglot
[20:25:16] <Voidwarper> phy1729: making the file executable (chmod +x) and running it with eval worked
[20:25:24] <Voidwarper> is source a bash only thing?
[20:25:25] <danielsh> Voidwarper, 1. Don't try to write bilingual code 2. "options" is a reserved name, use another name (you _could_ zmodload to unload the name but you might break other things) 3. WDYT of adding a 'select -1 opt' syntax that avoids the need for an unconditional break? 
[20:25:38] <danielsh> Voidwarper, 'source' is not bash only no
[20:25:41] <phy1729> source isn't a bash only thing (but it also isn't POSIX)
[20:25:45] <danielsh> > source =(<<<'echo foo') 
[20:25:46] <machabot> danielsh: foo
[20:25:58] <phy1729> polyglot code is terrible espically between bash and zsh
[20:25:58] <danielsh> the '.' builtin is POSIX isn't it
[20:26:02] <phy1729> ues
[20:26:04] <Voidwarper> why does this work for zsh only with eval, but in bash it works with source too
[20:26:22] <Voidwarper> phy1729: what is the polyglot part about it?
[20:26:25] <phy1729> because options is special in zsh (also arrays start at 1)
[20:26:32] <Voidwarper> oh
[20:26:37] <danielsh> I did say that already :) 
[20:27:00] <Voidwarper> also i dont need at the beginning #!/bin/zsh or do i?
[20:27:14] <danielsh> 'source' doesn't care about #!
[20:27:17] <phy1729> You need a bash shebang because it's a bash script
[20:28:19] <danielsh> zayita, grep bash
[20:28:24] <Voidwarper> well ideally i want a script that plays well both in bash and zsh
[20:28:30] <Voidwarper> or mostly shell agnostic
[20:28:37] <phy1729> that way lies madness
[20:29:01] <danielsh> zayita, learn bilingual code is Don't write code that tries to be runnable under both bash and zsh.  See https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh/blob/master/Etc/FAQ.yo#L939-L997
[20:29:03] <zayita> danielsh: 'bilingual code' added.
[20:29:23] <danielsh> Voidwarper, ^^^ read that 
[20:29:39] <danielsh> most people don't need bilinguality
[20:30:12] <phy1729> with eval "$(script)" only the part printed for eval to consume needs to be bilingual
[20:33:28] <Voidwarper> ok so i will try to make it pure bash script, and just call it with eval
[20:33:41] <Voidwarper> make it executable, and also put #!/bin/bash on top
[20:34:00] <phy1729> sounds good
[20:34:12] <Voidwarper> although i tried to remove options for the array, didn't work

[20:35:46] <Voidwarper> i mean replace it with custom-list
[20:35:58] <Voidwarper> is it a reserved bash keyword?
[20:36:23] <danielsh> no idea
[20:38:43] <Voidwarper> i need to make it pure zsh script. eval doesn't change the path (neither does when using bash). i have to use source
[20:39:34] <Voidwarper> is there somewhere an example of a switch statement for zsh?
[20:39:39] <Voidwarper> can't find one online
[20:39:47] <phy1729> The idea is you print the commands that need to be run in the shell itself
[20:40:57] <Voidwarper> phy1729: yes
[20:41:14] <phy1729> The informational echos would need to go to stderr
[20:41:41] <phy1729> printf 'PATH="${HOME}/WebDev/node-v17.4.0-linux-x64/bin:${PATH}"\n'  for L10
[20:42:13] <Voidwarper> so i eval it, and it returns this?
[20:42:22] <danielsh> switch statement is called 'case'.  in all bourne derivatives
[20:42:41] <danielsh> phy1729, don't do that
[20:42:45] <danielsh> printf %s foo, always 
[20:42:48] <phy1729> you aren't eval'ing the script; you're evaling the output of the script
[20:42:55] <phy1729> danielsh: it's in single quotes
[20:43:11] <danielsh> Oh. sorry
[20:43:16] <phy1729> do you mean '%s\n' anyway?

[20:50:12] <phy1729> The whole point is you write basically no zsh code and just a few assignments have to be polyglot code.
[20:51:23] <danielsh> Voidwarper, there's definitely documentation about that in the manual
[20:51:49] <danielsh> grep for "esac"
[20:53:55] <phy1729> you want man zshmisc  not man zsh   (or man zshall works too)

[21:15:30] <danielsh> Voidwarper, select.  But you asked what a switch statement was called.  It's called "case".
[21:20:05] <Voidwarper> i found a way to make it work for zsh with select
[21:20:51] <Voidwarper> danielsh: https://dpaste.com/GGYDGQQGW
[21:21:01] <Voidwarper> i source this and it works.
[21:21:21] <Voidwarper> displays a menu 1-4 and i select the version and it exports it in current shell
[21:22:53] <Voidwarper> now have to figure how to do it in case
[21:23:02] <danielsh> hang on 
[21:23:12] <danielsh> first, if you source it then it doesn't need #!
[21:23:27] <danielsh> second, why do you think you need case
[21:23:31] <danielsh> what are you trying to do ? 
[21:23:43] <danielsh> Oh, one more thing
[21:24:02] <danielsh> the export statement doesn't behave differently when the user selects different values
[21:24:23] <Voidwarper> danielsh: what i did with the case bash script i sent before (also when you pick something out of range like 999 it should send you back to the menu instead of exiting, also i want a quit option)
[21:24:57] <Voidwarper> danielsh: yes thats why i wanted case, to have totally different paths. now i just replace the version in the folder name to make it work
[21:25:56] <Voidwarper> unfortunately i can't find a single example online and the manpage is not enough
[21:26:12] <danielsh> then ask a specific question :) 
[21:26:47] <danielsh> fwiw if the script does what it seems to do, there's a lot more magic you could use.  but one thing at a time
