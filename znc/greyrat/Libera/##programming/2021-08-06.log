[03:27:53] <Arahael> Izem: Basically there was a lot of media control at teh time - Spain was the only country at the time that had a free media, so they were the only country that regularly mentioned the flu. Therefore, it became known as the "Spanish Flu" even though they weren't the origin nor the hardest hit.
[03:27:56] <izak> i was refering to God as the as the true source of reality but not reated to relegion or any thing ?

[03:28:43] <Izem> oh interesting
[03:29:12] <Izem> I would imagine US would fave a free media around that period, surprise
[03:29:31] <Arahael> Izem: Curiously, america and many countries were quick and happy to wear masks, they had to survive without vaccines, in those days.  And no, teh US did not have a free media at the time, it was (initially) heavily suppressed.
[03:29:35] <vdamewood> Okay, so here's some official op talk. Religion and politics are fine to talk about as long as you're respectful and friendly, per the rules. But directly asking someone their beliefs might put them in an uncomfortable position so be respectful of others' unwillingness to talk about such things, if they don't want to.
[03:29:37] <Arahael> Izem: World political tensions were high.
[03:30:21] <Izem> I'm ok to discuss, but I was not sure about channel rules, cool :)
[03:30:45] <vdamewood> We might change that in the future if it blows up on us, but we're giving it a try.

[03:32:00] <Arahael> vdamewood: Awesome - thanks.
[03:32:23] <Izem> masks help make people feel safer
[03:32:35] <Joanna> Arahael: you need a full hazmat suit like they wear in labs to stop viruses.
[03:33:04] <Izem> wait, did they still have those crow masks or is that much earlier?
[03:33:06] <Izem> lol
[03:33:06] <Joanna> Izem: so does burying head in sand :)
[03:33:13] <Arahael> Izem: They've been proven to *reduce*, though yes, not stop, transmission.
[03:33:14] <eyynet4> unless you emit gamma rays!
[03:33:28] <Arahael> Izem: Much earlier, though the crow mask functioned differently.
[03:33:54] <Arahael> Joanna: Not stop - they reduced transmission, but they were doing their best.  People were dying, there were a *lot* of deaths.
[03:34:08] <Izem> Arahael: yeah I only mentioned that because health officials here sorta gave that sentiment, I did not look much into it

[03:34:33] <Arahael> Izem: The "crow" masks didn't filter the air, they concentrated fumes, they would use it as container for highly scented stuffs that would "ward" away sickness.
[03:34:41] <Izem> isn't that the same time some folks said screw it and went to the movies?
[03:34:56] <Izem> Arahael: oh I had no idea
[03:35:06] <Izem> only mentioned it because it was really funny
[03:35:32] <Arahael> Joanna: Not neccessarily a bad thing, depending on the particular microbes and how mobile they are, but yes, for the masks, wear them for 4 hours, then dispose or clean them in *hot* water.
[03:35:32] <Joanna> The reason the plague killed so many people is there was a year without summer I heard . In otherwords food shortages
[03:35:35] <Izem> funny looking*
[03:36:05] <Izem> cities probably still sucked back then
[03:36:37] <Joanna> Arahael: masks cause unsafe levels of co2 inside which can be detected with a hand held co2 alarm
[03:37:33] <Izem> Arahael: that is really curious though
[03:37:35] <jeaye> Condoms reduce pregnancy and STI transmission. Masks reduce covid transmission. Bagged bread lasts longer than naked bread. Big surprise? Shouldn't be. Covering things protects them more and protects other things from them.
[03:37:47] <Izem> why did people were masks more back then than now?
[03:38:17] <izak> now people are stupider ?
[03:38:22] <Izem> oof
[03:38:52] <Arahael> Joanna: Sorry, that's bullshit. :)
[03:39:00] <Joanna> jeaye: plastic and rubber are non permeable compared to cloth. A plastic bag on head would definitely stop Covid but at what cost ?
[03:39:09] <eyynet4> death rates are way down, people don't care anymore
[03:39:21] <Izem> I must say if was weird past few years it felt like a history book
[03:39:34] <eyynet4> virus is unstoppable, etc.
[03:39:42] <Arahael> eyynet4: They're trending up in my country at teh moment. :(
[03:39:43] <davros> thats why they have filters in propper masks instead of just cloth
[03:39:53] <jeaye> Joanna: That's what's known as a strawman argument. "A plastic bag would kill you. GOTCHA! Thus, masks do nothing." That's not how it works.
[03:39:55] <Joanna> Izem: maybe the plague masks were for warding off evil judging by their appearance
[03:39:58] <eyynet4> thats what happens when you block everyone off from natural exposure
[03:40:14] <davros> the mask wouldn't stop virus particles, it stops larger droplets carrying them
[03:40:21] <eyynet4> no idea why NYC death rates are unaffected by "new big bad variant"
[03:40:24] <eyynet4> otherwise
[03:40:29] <Joanna> A hazmat suit with filters might help stop Covid as I suggested earlier
[03:40:39] <izak> people this days are flat space than segmented
[03:40:49] <Izem> what does that mean?
[03:40:50] <AlexDelarge> lol
[03:40:55] <davros> i'm dissapointed with myself for not having had a hazmat suit or full face mask at some point
[03:41:20] <davros> i'm envious of the preppers who had those sort of things lying around

[03:46:38] <kline> in the grand scheme of things, even if masks dont significantly help, but dont really hurt, either
[03:46:40] <Izem> I was dissapointed in people that picked this as a solution :/
[03:46:54] <Joanna> Even if I did experiments myself nobody would believe me :)
[03:47:05] <kline> that said, even without specific, targeted research on their effectiveness, they do seem to have had a notable effect on the epidemiological outcomes
[03:47:24] <kline> so even if we dont know how or why masks work, they do have _some_ kind of positive effect, regardless of mechanism

[03:49:44] <jeaye> It doesn't work on anyone who stops to think about it, but it works on people who already have a decision made and who aren't interested in hearing any counter evidence.
[03:50:02] <Joanna> I really don’t like all these divide and conquer tactics about things that should be personal choices . Here we are in an unpleasant debate about masks on what is supposed to be a programming channel. If you like masks wear as many as you like I don’t care. But if you want to be safe from viruses you need a full hazmat suit and decontamination chamber at the entrance to your home.
[03:50:26] <PlanckWalk> Joanna: It's not binary.
[03:50:32] <PlanckWalk> (Despite this being a programmign channel)
[03:51:03] <PlanckWalk> They are a risk reductionm measure.

[03:51:59] <Izem> yeah that's what I heard too, they do this based on the probabilities of contact/exposure
[03:52:02] <PlanckWalk> You don't need to risk to zero for a virus to stop spreading.
[03:52:10] <Izem> which actually sounds really interesting
[03:52:34] <izak> so the risk depends on how may virus invade our body ?
[03:52:35] <jeaye> Joanna: If you had started with that, nobody would disagree. Instead, people would just say there are varying degrees of "safe".
[03:52:36] <PlanckWalk> You just need to get the average number of other people infected down below 1.
[03:52:38] <Joanna> Most people have made up their minds one way or the other and arguing about it is really a waste of time.
[03:52:50] <AlexDelarge> then don't
[03:53:03] <AlexDelarge> no one is forcing YOU to argue
[03:53:12] <Izem> izak: yeah pretty much
[03:53:21] <jeaye> Joanna: I don't want this to be unpleasant for anyone. It's important that nobody in here uses these cheap tactics for arguing, too (strawman, "prove me wrong", and "what aboutism"). None of these are helpful for actually making good arguments.
[03:53:36] <PlanckWalk> Joanna: Then stop making false claims.
[03:53:39] <Joanna> I sometimes but on a mask when I am about to cough just not to offend people nearby.
[03:53:39] <vdamewood> jeaye: Don't forget false dichotomy

[03:54:06] <AlexDelarge> indeed
[03:54:19] <AlexDelarge> its more like #defocus
[03:54:28] <AlexDelarge> *shrug*
[03:54:35] <vdamewood> "But if you want to be safe from viruses you need a full hazmat suit and decontamination chamber at the entrance to your home." is a pretty extreme claim.
[03:54:38] <jeaye> karstensrage: We're within the channel rules.
[03:54:48] <izak> is that is so we could gbe all infected with gmo food s and even our clothes.
[03:54:53] <izak> if*
[03:54:53] <Joanna> If I was afraid I would wear the hazmat suit not fool around with masks. But that’s my personal opinion
[03:55:07] <vdamewood> After all, what is 'safe' there are various levels of protection for all sorts of hazzards.
[03:55:20] <vdamewood> s/'safe'/'safe'?/
[03:55:20] <PlanckWalk> Hazmat suits aren't 100% safe.

[03:56:16] <Joanna> vdamewood: yes different levels of protection starting with just a gas mask all the way up to mopp  level 4

[03:59:28] <vdamewood> karstensrage: I could descend it in a matter of 20 seconds.... once.
[03:59:39] <karstensrage> vdamewood, lol
[03:59:53] <PlanckWalk> You need more BASE jump practice
[04:00:04] <izak> viruses dont occupy 100% of the atomospher so masks are okay.
[04:00:05] <vdamewood> or  a parachute

[04:02:22] <Izem> yes better to delay as much as possible
[04:02:32] <Izem> which was the point afaik
[04:02:47] <Joanna> I have asthma and don’t enjoy suffocating
[04:03:09] <PlanckWalk> Not just delay.  If you reduce transmission enough (which doesn't mean zero!), then you can get elimination.
[04:03:15] <jeaye> But that doesn't have anything to do with the efficacy of masks, Joanna.
[04:03:21] <jeaye> Most people don't have asthma.

[04:03:47] <Joanna> If I go into a store and someone starts yapping about masks I do a quick about face and take my money elsewhere.

[04:03:55] <Izem> but yeah

[04:04:03] <karstensrage> afaict the same selfish stupid behavior in the US was during the 1918 pandemic as this one, we learned nothing
[04:04:10] <PlanckWalk> In our area, people with respiratory medical conditions can get exemptions from mask wearing.  I think that's reasonable.
[04:04:30] <karstensrage> PlanckWalk, how do they check?
[04:04:41] <karstensrage> self attestation of anything is suspect
[04:04:52] <eyynet4> you have to pay someone to tell you its ok
[04:04:52] <PlanckWalk> You can get certificate from your doctor
[04:05:29] <karstensrage> sounds like a good money making scheme for a corrupt doctor
[04:05:43] <LjL> like any other doctor attestation
[04:05:43] <PlanckWalk> It's possible
[04:05:45] <LjL> nothing new there, move on
[04:05:54] <izak> why do we ahve to be paranoid about the technology while we can just use it ?
[04:05:57] <Joanna> jeaye: you know what’s really funny is on the train when a masker starts coughing and a nearby masker jumps up and runs away in terror to another part of train :)
[04:05:57] <PlanckWalk> But it's a big risk for the doctor

[04:06:09] <Izem> because history

[04:08:01] <karstensrage> safe'ish

[04:14:54] <izak> still extream.

[04:15:28] <AlexDelarge> LOL
[04:15:34] <Izem> ok side question
[04:15:44] <PlanckWalk> Yes, only eat cis fats
[04:15:49] <Joanna> Getting rid of cars would help solve obesity problem
[04:15:51] <Izem> isn't trans fat in some red meat?
[04:16:00] <Joanna> No
[04:16:08] <izak> extreme*
[04:16:33] <Izem> I see it on the nutrition label for some products so I was curious
[04:16:46] <Joanna> Trans fats are made by chemically altering natural oils
[04:17:04] <karstensrage> Small amounts of trans fats occur naturally in some meat and dairy products, including beef, lamb and butterfat. There have not been sufficient studies to determine whether these naturally occurring trans fats have the same bad effects on cholesterol levels as trans fats that have been industrially manufactured.
[04:17:12] <karstensrage> https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/fats/trans-fat

[04:17:30] <Izem> oh ok interesting
[04:17:47] <Izem> that makes sense, those are the products I see it on

[05:09:03] <Izem> and there's few vendors to purchase from, if only a single vendor
[05:09:11] <Arahael> Izem: In theory it oculd be 'open', but the idea of being able to modify it is incomaptible with the current expectation of rigour. It needs to be very very fixed.
[05:09:21] <Izem> good point
[05:09:39] <Izem> I'd be pretty nervous working on software like that
[05:10:32] <Arahael> Izem: Lots of formal requirements. Lots of hazards and risk analysis. Lots of testing and verification, including by actual verification engineers. And of course, controlled testing in the field, too, and scientific evidence gathered.

[05:25:01] <PlanckWalk> For any reasonable idea of "emulate", no.

[05:25:35] <PlanckWalk> Our most powerful computers are still having trouble working out the 3D structure of single proteins
[05:25:38] <Quietwalker> atomic 1:1 naw. We might get to a point where we can simulate, but that's like having a world where pi is only valid to 13 digits or something.
[05:26:15] <PlanckWalk> Let alone all the interactions
[05:26:36] <PlanckWalk> And that's just teh very bottom of the complexity tree
[05:26:41] <Quietwalker> Eventually, perhaps.
[05:27:18] <Quietwalker> but chasing more accurate simulations is about diminishing returns.
[05:27:21] <izak> so it is possible regardless of the technological limitations.
[05:27:27] <Quietwalker> Hmm.
[05:27:31] <PlanckWalk> In theory, it's possible.
[05:27:33] <Quietwalker> I suppose it could eventually be possible.

[05:27:53] <PlanckWalk> Maybe never.

[05:30:06] <Quietwalker> yeah, we can already do some of that.
[05:30:15] <Quietwalker> and then you can end up with a working brain and everything too

[06:45:53] <eyynet4> so you can't modify it in place without ensuring you are not creating a duplicate
[06:45:59] <blahboybaz> You can't have duplicates but you should be able to have the key BE a variable

[08:13:01] <eyynet4> i thought you learned kung fu through some simulator
[08:13:01] <sumyunguy2> Bjj is a combination of all the grappling sports. It began I think in 1919 using judo ground tactics and the Gracie family that made it trabelled the world and brought back all the useful elements of every martial art. Its only 100 years old so its evolving very rapidly. I have myself invented 2 moves which are now standard to pass beyond white belt. Every pro has a DVD with all their own moves
[08:13:25] <sumyunguy2> No I use a motion tracker to analyze my moves but I don't have access anymore

Kickboxing sparring.... yo man you're hurting me, I'm like I'm hitting as soft as I can with full proper technique. But he won BJJ worlds last year for his weight class
[08:15:51] <sumyunguy2> He was such a mooch
[08:16:36] <Izem> so he didn't pay for the promotion tests?
[08:16:37] <sumyunguy2> Like one time the kids instructor quit so he asked me and my girlfriend to do 2 hours of classes 6 days a week and he didn't pay us, and when his business grew he had all the labor of setting up the new dojo free from students
[08:18:19] <sumyunguy2> You don't have to with Gringo(his coach who ran the affiliate dojo) he charges 130 cdn a month and gives you any and all classes you want, free food and refreshments, grow weed for us to smoke when we train. Gringo is the guy who brought jiu-jitsu to Ontario, was first one to get a black belt then return home, so he gave every black belt in Ontario their belt
[08:18:29] <sumyunguy2> He's a great guy, but he's strict
[08:19:27] <sumyunguy2> Like you gotta wear clothes under your gi and pants so you don't end up naked, no marks or stains on the gi, you can't wear any color but blue black or white gi, which passed me off because I was the pink guy at my first 2 dojo lol
[08:19:40] <Izem> I am also in ontario, I have not done much martial arts though
[08:20:14] <Izem> of course you have to wear clothes under your gi ...
[08:20:35] <Izem> that's pretty basic
[08:20:56] <sumyunguy2> Action Reaction MMA in Northern Toronto, only actually good MMA dojo in Ontario, best jiu-jitsu place in Ontario,  and every coach who trained under him is an affiliate so you can go to almost every Gringo dojo with no extra fee
[08:20:58] <Izem> blue black and white are standard, my gym did not care about gi colours though
[08:21:31] <sumyunguy2> Clothes under your gi is not ibjjf standard, and before him I never had any. And every bjj guy is doing hair removal anyways

[08:23:47] <sumyunguy2> The great thing about being a martial artist is you walk around with confidence, you know you can defend yourself, you know if you wanted to even though you don't intend to, you can just kill tons of people

[09:01:19] <vdamewood> flareon: Nearly all islamic names are variants of such. The real prohibition is that God's names include 'Al' while peopel's don't. so a person named 'malik' is fine. but 'al-malik' is not.

[09:01:25] <sumyunguy2> Yes
[09:01:43] <sumyunguy2> But I've lived in many places over the years
[09:01:58] <flareon> sumyunguy2: no need to learn Persian then. i suppose Iranian women too have white fever.
[09:02:03] <edgar-rft> Herewith I offically allow all muslims to be named after me.
[09:02:12] <flareon> vdamewood: yeah.
[09:02:57] <sumyunguy2> They usually don't date outside their race I notice from seeing Iranian couples together, but I am good with getting girls somehow I don't understand how being blunt and direct and outspoken gets girls but it works for me
[09:03:06] <sumyunguy2> Last 4 girlfriends have been Persian
[09:03:18] <sumyunguy2> And I didn't learn the language with the first one lol
[09:03:28] <flareon> sumyunguy2: there it goes.
[09:03:33] <sumyunguy2> What?
[09:03:58] <flareon> sumyunguy2: you don't need Persian.
[09:04:09] <vdamewood> Persian is still a fun language.
[09:04:12] <sumyunguy2> But I mean, what if I want to speak their language?
[09:04:18] <sumyunguy2> I like knowing languages
[09:04:23] <vdamewood> Though, the writing system is irritating as all hell, though.
[09:04:38] <sumyunguy2> I can't write in English even
[09:04:42] <Arahael> vdamewood: Just put hte pen to paper, and jiggle the paper out from the side? ;)
[09:04:43] <sumyunguy2> This is text to speech
[09:04:55] <flareon> sumyunguy2: if you have Persian fever, you can try to learn it. it's a dead language though. Persians try to learn English nowadays.

[09:21:23] <sumyunguy2> Let's talk about programming
[09:21:27] <Arahael> flareon: Look, it's a balancing act. :(
[09:21:38] <sumyunguy2> Anyone else really enjoy coding in python?
[09:21:50] <flareon> sumyunguy2: not really.
[09:21:52] <Izem> I think python bytecode is cool
[09:21:54] <|smlckz|> *sigh*
[09:22:34] <sumyunguy2> Python i like because it's like pseudocode except it works until you replace the heavy lifting with a C based library which is the obvious move for a performance based app
[09:22:45] <|smlckz|> sumyunguy2: have you tried any lisp?
[09:22:49] <sumyunguy2> I have 6 lines of code in cpython interprer
[09:22:52] <sumyunguy2> I have not
[09:23:05] <sumyunguy2> 6 whole lines
[09:23:39] <flareon> sumyunguy2: i feel Haskell or Scheme syntax is a much better pseudo-code than Python.
[09:23:46] <sumyunguy2> I made a function to resize the window in every terminal in every os and it made it into the interpreter from my github
[09:23:48] <sumyunguy2> Lol
[09:24:10] <sumyunguy2> Although they improved it to support other terminals besides the ones I tested and knew worked
[09:24:39] <sumyunguy2> I have 6k lines in Linux kernel, hardware support. Women love to hear how many lines of code you have in the Linux kernel
[09:24:40] <|smlckz|> such is the beauty of open source
[09:24:43] <sumyunguy2> Yes
[09:25:15] <sumyunguy2> I contribute a lot to Linux kernel that gets rejected because its pure asm with no comments and they can't understand it. You're kernel development people the code should explain itself common

[09:29:33] <|smlckz|> i had to debug 3 lines for two hours, so hmm
[09:30:27] <sumyunguy2> Once I had a select call in some socket code or something similar. I was maybe 12 and using C. 6 months of staring at the code to notice I wrote 01 instead of 10 in a argument
[09:30:34] <flareon> i've never written assembly except for some "hello, world" type programs. i feel i should learn it to better my C understanding.
[09:30:35] <sumyunguy2> Most painful bug i ever dealt with
[09:31:54] <sumyunguy2> I wrote an OS, assembler, compiler for c, libc, telnet client, and minimal buggy web browser all in asm but it only works on the exact hardware I was writing it for. No drivers except in the kernel not as modules
[09:32:09] <Izem> flareon I don't think that's necessary, just get a good C book
[09:32:23] <sumyunguy2> It was pretty fun but I reached the point where I had learned enough about os and compiler dev to move onto actually contributing code to useful projects
[09:32:31] <sumyunguy2> It was a learning experience,  nothing more
[09:32:38] <Arahael> flareon: I'd not enjoy modern assembly. :(  Just get a good compiler, imho.
[09:32:48] <flareon> Izem: i feel C is a layer over assembly so many abstraction details do leak out.
[09:32:49] <Izem> but it's always better to learn assembly I think
[09:32:54] <Izem> eh
[09:33:24] <vdamewood> Usually, when the assembly leeks through, it's undefined behavior in C.
[09:33:27] <vdamewood> leaks
[09:33:28] <sumyunguy2> I have been some occasions working on drivers for my S20+ Samsung galaxy to run pure Linux
[09:33:49] <flareon> vdamewood: yeah.
[09:33:51] <vdamewood> But I do suggest learning assembly for assembly's sake to improve coding.
[09:34:20] <sumyunguy2> Os dev, compiler dev, assembly, reverse engineering  = white hat with 6 figure income
[09:34:40] <AlexDelarge> ^ definitely...it helped me a lot back when I started on 6502
[09:34:43] <Arahael> vdamewood: Sure - but not modern stuff :D
[09:34:53] <sumyunguy2> I did it by accident and I hate doing audits honestly but I made some money freelance auditing things
[09:34:57] <Arahael> I've really enjoyed my time writing 8051 assembly.
[09:35:15] <sumyunguy2> I like writing compiler optimization operations
[09:35:28] <flareon> sumyunguy2: it does help to build non-fluff skills which are guaranteed to be useful.
[09:35:41] <sumyunguy2> I improved GCC performance compiling itself by 0.7% just by randomly trying to optimize the same methods in different orders
[09:35:51] <|smlckz|> do/will you open source your assembly code?

[09:58:20] <Arahael> :)
[09:58:30] <sumyunguy2> Like they require 8-10 hours a day of attention,  they bite and make you bleed
[09:58:41] <sumyunguy2> They shit everywhere,  destroy everything you own
[09:59:06] <Arahael> I thought you can manage the shitting by being careful where you feed them and time their releases just right?
[09:59:23] * Arahael is not a bird person, mind you.
[09:59:27] <vdamewood> So, Aarakocras and Rito are all insane?
[09:59:29] <sumyunguy2> They cost 3-4 times as much to get medical care than a cat or dog, they need hundreds of dollars a month in toys and food, you basically live to take care of your birds or you are a neglectful owner.
[09:59:40] <sumyunguy2> If they have more than one parrot probably
[10:00:29] <sumyunguy2> I only got into parrots 3.5 years ago with my first one, I have 4 now, and waiting list for 2 more, and probably going to buy a few more conure when I get more settled with my daughter who just came into my life

[11:37:13] <Arahael> vdamewood: Curious expression in wikipedia: "He also gained a stake in the very large estates of Ernulf de Hesdin by marriage to his daughter, Avelina.", reads to me like he married his own daughter, and thus got those estates.  But it turns out that an entirely different "he" married his daughter.  Is this normal english?

[11:41:23] <Arahael> ...seems that their lands came to Alan as a consequence of his elevation to the shrievalty of the county. He also gained a stake in the very large estates of Ernulf de Hesdin by marriage to his daughter, Avelina.
[11:41:32] <Arahael> It's a distinct sentence to me.
[11:41:52] <GeDaMo> Yes, but the "He" refers to someone from the previous sentence
[11:41:55] <Arahael> It's indeed clearer though when reading the paragraph *carefully*, but if you skim and read the last sentence, I was confused.

[12:53:56] <veiviser> sharing code is just managing dependencies for which there are 50 million ways of doing it
[12:54:29] <shad> pyzozord: because i'm the DevOps that's responsible for how it behaves in production. I should be implicated in the dev process. One of the problems i can see a mile away is introducing a bug in the "lib/" dir (n the case of nx.dev) means introducing a bug in every service
[12:55:09] <shad> I also feel like Gitlab's registry Docker per project should only contain Docker images for 1 project, not N
[12:55:20] <veiviser> if that lib/ was used by every service anyway by some other dependency management it would still introduce a bug in every service regardless
[12:55:48] <shad> Using monorepos, you also lose the ability of git to rollback changes ie: you made changes in web, then in api, the commit for web was bad, too bad there's new commits in between
[12:55:57] <pyzozord> shad: I don't think that's part of devops responsibility to prevent dev bugs
[12:56:07] <veiviser> you can roll things back in git like that though?
[12:56:28] <shad> pyzozord: its part of devops responsibility to maintain quality of the code base
[12:56:34] <Akronymus> Sharing code...
[12:56:37] <pyzozord> shad: I don't think so
[12:56:48] <pyzozord> shad: dev ops deals with everything else that is NOT code
[12:56:52] <shad> Also, tools like Snyk, dependabot etc are a nightmare to configure in exotic repos
[12:56:59] <pyzozord> shad: mostly infrastructure
[12:57:00] <Akronymus> Quite frequently I find people putting code that looks the same but has different meaning into a dedicated function and then reuse that.
[12:57:19] <Akronymus> Which usually turns out badly.
[12:57:22] <shad> pyzozord: that's not the definition I have. For me, DevOps is 50% dev, 50% Ops. The idea being a part of dev process to adapt code to infra
[12:57:48] <Arahael> shad: Not entirely true, you can still revert commits, as an example, and you can still cherry-pick and do sub-tree merges, etc.
[12:58:02] <Arahael> I do prefer avoiding monorepos, though, just pointing out that a mono-repo is not always bad.
[12:58:19] <pyzozord> shad: I think that's a wrong way to go about it, the adaptation should come from both ends
[12:58:55] <d3x0r> duplicating a /lib to a dozen copies is terrible anyway - fixing the bug that is present in all the other projects, just not uncovered, doesn't fix the others either.
[12:59:08] <Helmholtz> Is there a FREE temporary linux VPS to build stuff?
[12:59:21] <shad> Arahael: fair enough, you _can_ use git and manage you way to rollback your commits. I just see a git tree complicated with unrelated projects put together. And that won't scale
[12:59:21] <d3x0r> fix is easy -rollback if it was introduced and mission critical.  Not all projects deploy at every change though, no?
[12:59:25] <veiviser> theres free CI instances if thats what you mean Helmholtz
[12:59:33] <veiviser> but not something you can just manage yourself for free
[12:59:40] <Helmholtz> veiviser, I want to ssh into it
[12:59:49] <veiviser> nope
[12:59:54] <Helmholtz> I've already setup GitHub to do so but I want to now if there is another

[13:00:21] <deniska> People often say how dynamically linked libraries allow you to fix the same bug in multiple programs at once. But then never talk about the fact, that you can also introduce a bug at multiple programs at once :P
[13:00:50] <d3x0r> deniska no it's quite the converse...
[13:01:04] <d3x0r> it's always 'dll's introduce bugs where you don't mean them'
[13:01:09] <pyzozord> I think having a module "releases" and each project using whatever version of the module they need is a good way. It decopules things more
[13:01:17] <shad> I also feel like monorepos violate the principle of single responsibility, which should be one of the most important principles to follow in software engineering

[13:48:40] <CoderGuy> lets say I wanted to generate a random number
[13:48:51] <Akronymus> int getRandom()
[13:48:55] <Akronymus> return 4;
[13:48:59] <CoderGuy> is there a way to generate said random number without time being a factor in determining the result?
[13:49:10] <Akronymus> Truly random?

[13:49:23] <Akronymus> Or PRNG?
[13:49:24] <CoderGuy> but even if it was Truly Random, wouldn't time always be a factor?
[13:49:50] <Akronymus> Depends on what you mean when saying time.
[13:49:56] <CoderGuy> okay i'll give an example
[13:50:03] <CoderGuy> lets say you press the button and a result is generated
[13:50:17] <CoderGuy> does time matter when pushing that button, for randomness to occure?
[13:50:27] *** Joins: gggp_ (~gggp@123.113.176.18)
[13:50:37] <Akronymus> It doesn't matter.
[13:50:45] <Akronymus> Unless you use time as a seed.
[13:50:54] <CoderGuy> but if you don't use time, isn't that a pre generated result?
[13:51:15] <Akronymus> This is where the line becomes blurry
[13:51:23] <CoderGuy> yeah that's where my question is
[13:51:30] <Akronymus> is the fact that it happened at some point in time reason that it is based on time?
[13:51:39] <CoderGuy> that can be a thing
[13:51:45] <CoderGuy> like lets say you're using the alignment of planets for example
[13:51:53] <CoderGuy> well the planets aligned a certain way at that moment in time
[13:52:04] <Akronymus> Because while collapsing quantum functions can happen at any time for true rng.
[13:52:04] <CoderGuy> so even if you have like 9 elements, they're all using time
[13:52:06] <pyzozord> CoderGuy: it's like asking is 2 a pregenerated result for 1 + 1
[13:52:12] <Akronymus> You still have it happen somewhere in time.
[13:52:13] <CoderGuy> isn't it/
[13:52:18] <CoderGuy> 1 + 1 is 2 that's pre generated no?
[13:52:27] <CoderGuy> time won't effect that 1 + 1 is 2
[13:52:58] <CoderGuy> yeah that's what I mean somewhere in time it takes place
[13:53:01] <Akronymus> CoderGuy Quantum states can be used for true rng.
[13:53:12] <Akronymus> But it could have collapsed now or 10 years ago.
[13:53:16] <CoderGuy> but the very act of said quantum state, doesn't that get effected by time?
[13:53:17] <Akronymus> Wouldn't make a difference.
[13:53:36] <CoderGuy> cuz if it's not effected by time, then isn't the result just known prior to you pressing the button?

[13:54:33] <CoderGuy> if you shuffle a deck of cards, the result of the top card is known prior to you flipping it
[13:54:52] <CoderGuy> so I would argue the rng is in the moments prior to it being shuffled
[13:55:06] <CoderGuy> all the things that took place in shuffling the cards, that was the rng
[13:55:12] <CoderGuy> once shuffled the result is now determined
[13:55:31] <Akronymus> Does a sequence of actions constitute as being based on time?
[13:55:34] <CoderGuy> YES
[13:55:41] <CoderGuy> the sequence that took place is based on the timeline that took place
[13:55:43] <Akronymus> Then every rng is based in time.
[13:55:44] <pyzozord> CoderGuy: I don't know enough about mathematics. It sounds like a question for doctor of philosophy in math. For my leyman view I like to think that all of math is already out there and that's why we use words like "discover" or "find" for new math instruments
[13:55:48] <CoderGuy> okay okay
[13:56:06] <Akronymus> Originally I thought you meant seeding based on unix time or something like that.
[13:56:11] <CoderGuy> now a pre shuffled deck of cards, the moment you decide to shuffle them and the time it takes shuffling with the events inside, I would say "okay it's been shuffled the rng is sorted out already"

[14:02:22] <CoderGuy> is time a changing factor?
[14:02:29] <Akronymus> Yes.
[14:02:32] <CoderGuy> oh
[14:02:34] <CoderGuy> then no not same
[14:02:37] <CoderGuy> different time
[14:02:46] <Akronymus> It isn't the same initial condition if the clock differs for example.
[14:02:46] *** Quits: DnzAtWrk (~DnzAtWrk@mobile-access-6df05f-197.dhcp.inet.fi) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[14:03:01] <CoderGuy> right okay what I mean is we start out the same but then the clock advances to make that the change in conditions
[14:03:12] <Akronymus> But if both environments are indistingushable from the inside, then for all intents and purposes it is the same initial condition.
[14:03:24] <CoderGuy> yeah okay so the clock changes, that's the only change in the prng setup
[14:03:28] <CoderGuy> will that effect outcome?
[14:03:42] <Akronymus> Depends on if the internal time is used in the prng
[14:03:53] <CoderGuy> 1 pc runs it with clock at 230948234 idk what the long is but yeah that and then the next is 230948245
[14:03:56] <CoderGuy> advance it some
[14:04:11] <Akronymus> And then there is randomness that is accumulated within the cpu based on outside factors and such
[14:04:26] <CoderGuy> sure but given same exact everything only difference is the clock
[14:04:36] <Akronymus> Then it depends
[14:04:50] <CoderGuy> is it more likely to be different?
[14:04:57] <Akronymus> MUCH more likely
[14:05:08] <CoderGuy> okay lets cuz I understand obviously same 2 results can always occure just not likely
[14:05:11] <pyzozord> I think that's how /dev/random is generated. Kernel just grabs trash, throws it all into /dev/random and then stirs it
[14:05:15] <Akronymus> Due to most prngs using the current time in some form or another.
[14:05:34] <CoderGuy> now with True Random are they using an outside factor which imo would rely on well space time
[14:05:37] <Akronymus> pyzozord oh right, I was thinking dev/random
[14:05:49] <Akronymus> It may
[14:06:02] <Akronymus> stuff like quantum states don't really depend on time
[14:06:14] <CoderGuy> so if that's true, then technically speaking the moment in time you pick to generate randomness is a huge factor no?
[14:06:24] <Akronymus> Stuff like lava lamps do depend on time
[14:06:31] <mrig> clocks are never the same if they do not have the exact same location also.
[14:06:43] <CoderGuy> i'm not saying you can be a god and pick the right spot in time
[14:06:48] <mrig> time and space are inseparable.
[14:06:53] <Akronymus> I think we are running into #physics territory here
[14:06:58] <CoderGuy> i'm just saying when the rng is not something you wanted, you clearly didn't pick the righ ttime to generate it no?

[14:09:02] <Akronymus> Very unlikely but it depends.

[14:13:25] <mrig> what is the most lunatic series of numbers that it can generate, then base your calculations upon that, would be my best guess.
[14:13:57] <CoderGuy> can you show that with an example i'm a bit confused
[14:14:04] <mrig> by that I mean improbable.
[14:14:08] <piou> In my country at least a slot machine with predetermined outputs would certainly be illegal (based on very similar issues), and I'm sure it's the same in many other places
[14:14:24] <CoderGuy> piou yeah that's what i'm saying
[14:14:29] <mrig> CoderGuy: ive a model in my head by it is not serialised.
[14:14:31] <CoderGuy> pre generated is illegal under regulations
[14:14:53] <mrig> piou: random numbers are imaginary, you cant have anything but predetermined outputs.
[14:15:16] <mrig> pseudo-random is the key word I suppose.
[14:15:29] <CoderGuy> mrig, but there's a difference between something changing all the time, and like a deck of cards that was pre shuffled

[14:16:07] <pyzozord> yeah
[14:16:16] <mrig> I believe that fractals are, not sure if it is the Mandelbrot.
[14:16:24] <piou> mrig: the question of whether true randomness exists in the world is not answered yet, so I won't go affirming one way or the other. But that's not what I'm talking about here.
[14:16:24] <mrig> you use coordinates.
[14:16:39] <CoderGuy> I mean there's just a difference if it's a deck of cards pre shuffled, imo thats pre determined prior to you spinning, based on the deck, but if the result is forever changing, that's more not pre determined as each moment it's changing
[14:16:42] <mrig> piou: what does true mean? :P

[14:20:07] <CoderGuy> yeah it's probably casino favord
[14:20:27] <mrig> but the question is as to whether watching the machine for a specific length of time, can increase the users chances.
[14:20:41] <mrig> logical it can.

[14:20:46] <mrig> logicaly
[14:20:55] <Akronymus> In specific instances, it can

[14:21:17] <pyzozord> except the time of the cycle could be like a bilion years for example. Obviously it's in the best interest of the casion to make it as random as they can

[14:26:09] <piou> CoderGuy: when doing stats you generally only need your random numbers to be uniform (ie: they present little to no pattern). But in many cases (generally when security is involved) you need more than that. For example generating a random session token. You need it to be impossible to predict from previous outputs and impossible to deduce from future outputs. And other similar properties that are
[14:26:10] <mrig> piou: Is the range of the CSPRNG regulated?
[14:26:13] <GeDaMo> There's a shasum command line tool
[14:26:15] <piou> precisely along the line of "watch as long as you want, you can guess nothing more than if you've watched nothing". That's what a Cryptographically Secure Pseudo Random Number Generator (CSPRNG) is, and we've known how to make them for a long time now. Main idea is to use what's essentially a strong hash function alongside very regularly updating the internal state from outside events so that you
[14:26:21] <piou> can never hit a cycle.
[14:26:23] <user51> i love homoiconic languages. who needs parsing anyway?
[14:26:24] <piou> mrig: what do you mean by range here?
[14:26:29] <mrig> min max
[14:26:36] <mrig> its cycle
[14:26:45] <piou> mrig: a CSPRNG is defined at a bit level and doesn't have a cycle by construction
[14:26:53] <GeDaMo> Helmholtz: Try shasum -a 256
[14:26:54] <piou> in practice it'll output bytes though
[14:27:08] <Helmholtz> GeDaMo, what's the diff?
[14:27:13] <GeDaMo> Diff?
[14:27:15] <mrig> But those bits represent a range of real integers still.
[14:27:20] <CoderGuy> piou, sure but that thing you're describing is not a known result that waits for you to press spin, it's a result that is found once you press spin right?
[14:27:21] <piou> But the definition is that you can't get information about a single bit from previous outputs (and related constraints)
[14:27:37] <piou> mrig: it's a stream, you can get as many bits as you want and interpret them as you want
[14:27:52] <Rashad> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=It4YOYzEaVY

[14:28:23] <Helmholtz> GeDaMo, sorry
[14:28:42] <CoderGuy> piou even if it doesn't cycle that's not what i'm getting at, i'm just saying the result is picked once you press spin, not picked and waiting for you to press spin right?
[14:28:47] <pyzozord> mrig: I'm not sure but I think casinos don't need to rig the prng, they rig the game, so the probabilities are in they favor
[14:28:50] <piou> CoderGuy: well, you can prepare a random number in advance or query it when you need it, but there's no list of random numbers ready for you to get

[14:30:28] <mrig> Exactly, the calling code defines it.
[14:30:39] <pyzozord> like they just need a nice uniform prng and a game where the house wins 51% of the time, and then they use the law of large numbers
[14:30:42] <CoderGuy> so sure have a stream of bits etc, but the forever changing element is time, as time goes by the stream changes or whatever, thus whenever you press spin it's a new result

[14:31:25] <Akronymus> AFAIK the standard is that 95% overall is paid out

[14:41:10] <CoderGuy> or at the very least, you picked the right moment for the decks state of the next outcomes

[14:42:04] <DnzAtWrk> if a machine uses real money, you can "somewhat" cheat
[14:42:08] <CoderGuy> but there's no reason to switch machines, if said machines are always coming up with a new result each time you press spin
[14:42:11] <piou> CoderGuy: thing is, there are technically many ways to get the same visible outcome, some that are forbidden by law and others that are equally possible. At that point you're not going to get closer to the truth by chatting on IRC
[14:42:12] <DnzAtWrk> by going to machines after someone else put tons of money in it
[14:42:19] <DnzAtWrk> and not going to machines which already paid out
[14:43:00] <CoderGuy> piou, oh yeah sure i'm not talking about visuals, I was just curious what is the deciding factor in rng, but this discussion alone pointed me in the direction of "what about a pre shuffled result"
[14:43:18] <piou> Yeah, that's like avoiding the most played lottery numbers: it doesn't make you more likely to win but if you do win you're more likely to win more so it increases your expected gain overall
[14:43:25] <DnzAtWrk> when I used to play slot machines, I immidietely changed machine after winning
[14:43:28] <CoderGuy> DnzAtWrk, so you have the theory a machine that has taken a bunch of money is ready to pop?
[14:43:33] <DnzAtWrk> it was a good strategy, +- 0% I believe

[14:47:18] <death916> a kid could make that in minecraft

[14:47:50] <CoderGuy> maybe that's what happened
[14:48:07] <CoderGuy> maybe originally you'd have these machines fill up with cash and then empty for jackpots

[14:48:29] <deniska> what feels "random" to humans and what is random mathematically are quite distinct concepts

[14:50:05] <deniska> death916: yes
[14:50:09] <CoderGuy> deniska, so you would say then that each spin is a fresh new result, versus a pre shuffled set of results?
[14:50:14] <death916> idk
[14:50:14] <piou> death916: can absolutely be
[14:50:17] <deniska> CoderGuy: sure
[14:50:32] <deniska> CoderGuy: well, I mean, conceptually there's no difference
[14:50:34] <piou> death916: the dice isn't less random if you decide that you only win on a six
[14:50:37] <mrig> The range of possibilities would be n^w where n is the number of figures on a wheel and w the number of wheels.
[14:50:42] <death916> i guess
[14:50:53] <CoderGuy> deniska, in that case, would you argue that the time one chooses to press spin, even though you can't possibly know the outcome, i'm just saying the time one does pick to press spin can be attributed to the result as in "you picked the right time" ?
[14:51:03] <deniska> CoderGuy: the set of results can be shuffled in a way that a machine will give two or three jackpots in a row, it's just unlikely
[14:51:14] <CoderGuy> oh of course
[14:51:20] <CoderGuy> i'm just saying can you give credit to the time one picks?

[14:54:19] <CoderGuy> all i'm saying is, if the person didn't press the button at that time slot, and considering there were different results surrounding said timeslot that were losses, and said person could have pressed during said losses, they picked the right time to press it
[14:54:26] <deniska> mrig: monty hall observes a single outcome for which you receive more information, not a series of outcomes
[14:54:48] <mrig> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem
[14:55:01] <CoderGuy> deniska, like what we know from slots is a lot of the time you press it and you lose
[14:55:09] <mrig> deniska: you are getting information by watching and timing though.
[14:55:12] <deniska> mrig: if you flip a coin 5 times and got tails, the odds of getting heads the next throw is still 50%
[14:55:18] <CoderGuy> deniska, so all i'm saying is, if you end up pressing it and winning, does that mean you pressed it at the right time?
[14:55:38] <deniska> slot machine works the same way, it's just that tails have much higher probability than 50%

[15:02:21] <CoderGuy> well people say "no it doesn't mean you selected the right moment in time" but technically speaking, if there were wrong moments in time, then there has to be a right one no?
[15:02:36] <pyzozord> CoderGuy: haven't we answered your question already?
[15:02:45] <mrig> CoderGuy: apparently if the algorithm is as specified by piou, then it is not shuffled and is a stream of randomness.
[15:02:51] <CoderGuy> no cuz some pepole say it's a pre shuffled deck, others say it's always random
[15:03:13] <pyzozord> CoderGuy: because it can be either or both
[15:03:17] <piou> CoderGuy: your question can be answered in the case of a specific machine by studying how it works, you can't get a general answer because different machines can take different approaches
[15:03:20] <CoderGuy> mrig, in a stream of randomness, if you ask the stream for the number 8, and it gives you the number 8, did you ask the stream a thte right time for the number 8?
[15:03:27] <deniska> CoderGuy: "I pressed it at the right time" is a way to view it, but it's more of a figure of speech or even a philosophical concept, than something mathematically defined
[15:03:37] <mrig> CoderGuy: this is what the math behind the specification of the regulations that control the design of the machines says.
[15:03:44] <deniska> CoderGuy: when talking about randomness one must be very careful not to conflate one with another
[15:03:54] <piou> CoderGuy: and unless a slot machine designer enters the chan nobody on IRC can say more than what's been said already, and even then it would only be for the specific machine they worked on
[15:04:22] <piou> CoderGuy: so, that's why there's been no improvement in the discussion for the last 30 minutes
[15:04:26] <CoderGuy> deniska, oh i'm not trying to, i'm just saying observably did it mean the randomness was constantly changing, and thus picking that moment in time effected it
[15:04:30] <deniska> the code of a slot machine will look more or less like `if random() > 0.99 then throw money`

[15:05:58] <piou> CoderGuy: already answered: should be but a bad machine doesn't have to be influenced by time. It would be bad though.

[15:06:30] <CoderGuy> pyzozord, yeah and that's fine, i'm just asking if it is
[15:06:38] <deniska> CoderGuy: the two question you'd typically ask about a specific random generator is 1) how hard is it to predict, 2) does it behave sufficiently enough like an ideal random generator would

[15:07:40] <pyzozord> CoderGuy: that's a wrong question to ask then. Everything is, so the answer is always yes. I think you conflated "algorithm design" with "philosophy".
[15:07:43] <deniska> CoderGuy: time or something influenced by time can affect the state of a random number generator
[15:07:47] <CoderGuy> so basically a pre shuffled deck of cards imo was effected by time prior to being shuffled, but a good RNG generator, will use the current timestate to get a new result
[15:07:55] <deniska> like sure lava lamp is in a different state from one moment to another
[15:08:00] <piou> PS4 had a very important security issue due to one of their random number generators outputting "4" all the time rather than being actually random. Intel on-chip "CSPRNG" too, but with 0, not 4.
[15:08:04] <CoderGuy> yeah that's all deniska that's it, just that
[15:08:14] <DnzAtWrk> imo, a good rng doesn't use time. It uses a source of randomness based on time
[15:08:16] <CoderGuy> deniska, so time is effecting the rng, even though we can't possibly know in what way
[15:08:25] <pyzozord> CoderGuy: on the "algorithm" level, there can be random algorithms that aren't affected by time. On "philosophy" level, everything in universe might or might not be affected by anything or everything.
[15:08:25] <CoderGuy> DnzAtWrk, yeah but that's the same thing
[15:08:29] <DnzAtWrk> no
[15:08:47] <DnzAtWrk> time is a quantifiable metric
[15:08:50] <DnzAtWrk> which can be used as is
[15:08:56] <deniska> CoderGuy: if "we can't know in what way" then effectively we may just treat it as it doesn't affect it
[15:08:58] <CoderGuy> pyzozord, how do you have a random algorithm unaffected by time?

[15:09:28] <mrig> CoderGuy: how is time any different from entropy?
[15:09:37] <piou> CoderGuy: you keep saying "shuffled deck" but that's conflating a whole lot of things
[15:09:40] <pyzozord> CoderGuy: it's not truly random, it's pseudo random. All computer generated random algorithms are pseudorandom.
[15:09:42] <CoderGuy> idk how to answer that cuz i'm not aware of how entropy works
[15:09:49] <mrig> now entropy is critical to randomness.
[15:09:58] <mrig> crucial rather
[15:10:00] <DnzAtWrk> entropy is the amount of information in a system afaik
[15:10:04] <CoderGuy> deniska, I don't know how the sun makes me hot, but the sun makes me hot
[15:10:13] <DnzAtWrk> the more chaotic it is, the harder to predict it is, the more bits of information, the more entropy
[15:10:20] <Akronymus> beaky thanks you reminded me of this:  "The use of COBOL cripples the mind; its teaching should therefore be regarded as a criminal offense."
[15:10:21] <Akronymus> - E.W. Dijkstra

[15:10:41] <beaky> nice i iliek cobol
[15:10:44] <DnzAtWrk> because predicting the position of each piece of glass is hard
[15:10:47] <DnzAtWrk> it has tons of information
[15:10:48] <Akronymus> Being taught a imperative/OOP language first indeed cripples the mind IMO.
[15:10:51] <DnzAtWrk> compared to a single glass
[15:10:52] <CoderGuy> piou, okay then like, idk based on the results of the last horse race
[15:11:06] <Akronymus> Because you then think in state
[15:11:17] <CoderGuy> to me the horse race is what determined those results, and that horse race took place in time, so it's based on our timeline
[15:11:19] <mrig> DnzAtWrk: heat rising from a poorly lubricated gear is also entropy.
[15:11:29] <DnzAtWrk> and heat coming from a computer CPU
[15:11:33] <DnzAtWrk> that also increases entropy
[15:11:36] <DnzAtWrk> computers create entropy
[15:11:41] <DnzAtWrk> but are ordered for us
[15:11:46] <CoderGuy> DnzAtWrk, i'm not saying we would predict, i'm just saying time is effecting it
[15:11:51] <piou> CoderGuy: I'm not opposed to a good philosophical discussion but this one is really running in circles
[15:12:29] <DnzAtWrk> heat increases entropy because heat is quite literally motion of molecules in a system
[15:12:37] <CoderGuy> piou, you have a point this is a coding channel and this discussion seems to be coming to a close, but I was just curious if time effects RNG I think the answer is yes but some people are hinting at like "well no magic effects it" and i'm like "how?" and they keep saying things that are effected by time

[15:14:45] <piou> CoderGuy: at that point it's down to definitions. One of the most common definitions of randomness by common people is the idea that doing the same thing twice doesn't give the same outcome.

[15:16:06] <piou> CoderGuy: so yes you will always find a way to put time in the mix, and yes you will always find a way to talk about randomness without talking about time, and no these don't contradict each other and neither is closer to the slot machine (except that, since it's a physical appliance, time does affect it)
[15:16:09] <pyzozord> CoderGuy: I'd be curious to know how to implement a prng too, I'm terrible at math and know nothing about cryptography
[15:16:44] <DnzAtWrk> you can use magical numbers
[15:16:47] <Akronymus> whatsupdoc (\[[^\[\]*?\])
[15:16:49] <CoderGuy> piou, I see, yeah I think time does effect it, but it's possible you have these pre rolled machines where it's like "yeah we used time when we pre generated the deck of results"
[15:16:58] <piou> pyzozord: may I recommend https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSfmtRc4VsE ?
[15:17:19] <Akronymus> Oh wait, I dropped a "]" before the "*"
[15:17:49] <CoderGuy> piou, obviously with a pre generated deck a casino could prevent giving out all their cash, but I think the laws of mathamatics are like "no dude let them spin independent you still win"

[15:18:00] <pyzozord> piou: sure you may! Thanks! :)
[15:18:03] <piou> CoderGuy: yes, it's possible, in which case time played a role (probably indirectly) during generation because of course it was it's a physical process and you can't say anything more than that because many things are possible

[15:20:54] <CoderGuy> thank you all for the discussion rng has always been something I don't really understand but I feel over time i've learned a lot :D
[15:20:55] <piou> CoderGuy: yes, we've been over that, and the end of the matter is that you can repeat it as long as you want but you won't get closer to the truth of how a specific spin machine does its thing because from the outside it's all the same
[15:21:04] <Akronymus> Regex is pretty fun for me
[15:21:16] <CoderGuy> piou, yeah that's true as well, but hey atleast I know it's one of the 2 options :D
[15:21:28] <CoderGuy> ALSO I can then factor this in, when I pick the RNG method for my own code :D

[15:25:38] <piou> Among all the PRNGs I've studied, my favourite one remains the DOOM PRNG that is used for things like ennemi actions and bullet spray. They just generated 256 random numbers once, put them in an array in their code, and the random() function simply cycles through that fixed array again and again. Great engineering.

[15:28:38] <Akronymus> IMO the doom rng being "solved" makes for better speedruns.
[15:28:51] <Akronymus> Or at least at a much higher skill level
[15:28:58] <piou> I've never seen a doom speedrun exploiting the PRNG though

[15:33:36] <piou> CoderGuy: thing is, randomness in minecraft isn't very fun for speedrunners. So in order to make better streams he had installed an extension giving better luck and "forgot" to disable it before doing actual speedruns. Then he proceeded to ignore everyone telling him that his luck was impossible and to avoid mentionning or thinking about the fact that he had just installed an extension that
[15:33:43] <piou> specifically played on luck, only to remember 6 month later.

[17:33:17] <beaky> hoare logic is a formalism that lets you reason with procedural programs in a composable way using logical preconditions and postconditions to specify the total program state
[17:33:20] <AlexDelarge> it's neat you dont even have to use a trigger character like !

[17:36:14] <Rashad> and why is that better or worse than the later classes thing?

[17:36:41] <Rashad> ok
[17:36:58] <Rashad> does it make you avoid compiler-writing pitfalls?
[17:37:25] <beaky> its different from classes it's a logic that lets you specify the properties of units of computation like 'after running this x = y + z' for example its related to design by contract but more formal and composable
[17:37:34] *** Joins: ugjka (~ugjka@ugjka.net)

[18:50:15] <Rashad> mental models: yes we can have different ones

[18:50:47] <CodeMouse92> mrig: Sure, but it is only applying a subset of logic. Functional looks at a different but equally valid subset. And so on.
[18:50:47] <Rashad> do the conclusions have to agree?
[18:51:34] <CodeMouse92> Rashad: Accounting for the limits of human cognitive ability, I'm not sure any two mental models ever *could* match up entirely, because no one has ever held the cohesive whole logical picture in their head at once.

[18:54:45] <Rashad> ok man we have to disagree
[18:54:55] <CodeMouse92> Those two apply to the preceding conversation, thanks for playing, time to move on.
[18:55:00] <Rashad> I don't think you're fair
[18:55:05] <CodeMouse92> OOP is not "the most logical". It's one effective mental model of several.
[18:55:14] <CodeMouse92> That was the only thing on the table before you moved the goalposts.
[18:55:22] <Rashad> ok man I am not interested in your NPD
[18:55:25] <CodeMouse92> OOP also isn't how EVERY sane person thinks.
[18:55:31] <Rashad> move on as you said you wanted to
[18:55:37] <mrig> Rashad: the mind is a self similar part of the logical model, it has to be because it runs on or from the same mechanism, how logic is perceived depends on the state of the mind that is perceiving it; This conundrum is inescapable.
[18:55:58] <Rashad> that's the longest most boring answer to a yes or no question
[18:56:14] <mrig> Rashad: do you often find yourself getting bored?
[18:56:19] <CodeMouse92> The simple mind desires the simple answer.
[18:56:20] <mrig> very telling.

[19:04:26] <Rashad> pyzozord it is an NPD tactic
[19:04:39] <Rashad> pyzozord I am right because you are dumb and I am the king
[19:05:03] <Rashad> and the discussion becomes about people rather than the topic
[19:05:06] <CodeMouse92> Rashad: https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/ad-hominem Dang, you're really rackin' these up!
[19:05:27] <mrig> Yes I'd go with logic being entirely dependant upon the state within which it is being parsed; Including ones state of mind.
[19:05:47] <mrig> and quintessential to that is the 'size' of a lexeme.
[19:05:50] *** Quits: gggp (~gggp@60.10.194.46) (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)
[19:06:14] <mrig> the size or scale of the lexical filter.
[19:08:05] <Rashad> GeDaMo was JavaScript precompiled before Chrome?
[19:08:22] <Rashad> before V8
[19:11:01] <pyzozord> mrig: I'd say logic is objective, but ones ability to miss or missmisinterpret facts and override logic is subjective to ones conditions
[19:11:02] <GeDaMo> "Precompiled"?
[19:11:08] <GeDaMo> You mean all compiled at load time?
[19:11:40] <Rashad> I don't think that's possible, right?
[19:11:46] <Rashad> but what is the opposite to JIT then?
[19:11:56] <GeDaMo> It's possible but I think most implementations use JIT compilation
[19:12:14] <GeDaMo> The JS source gets translated to a bytecode which is then interpreted
[19:12:31] <beaky> programming language primitives what are they and why some things should not be primitive https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/commentary/primitive.html
[19:12:32] <GeDaMo> Commonly used code is JITted to machine code
[19:12:36] <pyzozord> I think precomiling dynamic language is not possible, you can only jit in runtime because that's the moment when you have full information

[20:23:58] <SGautam> I'm writing a simple 2D engine, and I've a core "loop" that runs every frame, and then iterates through an array of entities and calls functions like OnKeyPress, OnKeyPressed, OnKeyRelease, OnTimerTick etc. Every entity is basically a class with overloadable functions like this.
[20:25:12] *** Quits: rsx (~dummy@ppp-188-174-136-83.dynamic.mnet-online.de) (Quit: rsx)
[20:25:16] <SGautam> My question is, is this a common method? It seems quite different to the way we usually program. But it greatly helps in game programming because you can have multiple things doing multiple things at the "same time" or at least appear to, giving an illusion of multitasking.
[20:25:45] <GeDaMo> https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/132587/book_excerpt_game_engine_.php
[20:25:48] <SGautam> Where can I read up on this?
[20:26:05] <cis> SGautam: If you're iterating through every entity on every frame, you'll eventually run into performance issues.
[20:26:05] <sjmulder> SGautam, component-entity-system is a popular approach

[20:27:11] <SGautam> cis: Right. That's one of the things too. Even with C++, I start dropping below 60 FPS at only 3200 entities.
[20:27:13] <DnzAtWrk> technically, the naming OnX is wrong
[20:27:23] <DnzAtWrk> OnSomething is the function called for the event
[20:27:32] <SGautam> Yes
[20:27:41] <DnzAtWrk> I name functions HandleX instead
[20:27:41] <cis> SGautam: You could have a system that keeps track of which entities have which callbacks, and then only iterate the ones that need to be called.

[20:28:30] <DnzAtWrk> I don't know if it's common, but it's literally what I always do

[20:29:10] <SGautam> That the engine cycles every loop.
[20:29:22] <DnzAtWrk> I have a couple of tips
[20:29:26] <DnzAtWrk> do you render by blitting
[20:29:32] <DnzAtWrk> or do you use some kind of scene graph?

[20:29:51] *** Quits: yamchah2 (~yamchah2@user/yamchah2) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[20:29:58] <DnzAtWrk> ie, do you render stuff directly to the screen
[20:30:02] <DnzAtWrk> or do you use shaders and whatnot
[20:30:15] <GeDaMo> Ideally, you have arrays (or vectors) of machine types so you want Struct of Array rather than Array of Struct
[20:30:23] <cis> SGautam: I don't know how hard it would be in your architecture, but each entity could register its callbacks in a class that keeps track of them, and then you'd use that to iterate. Maybe that could be automatic by scanning entities for the existence of callbacks, and registering them automatically.
[20:30:46] <DnzAtWrk> eh, just call them always
[20:31:02] <DnzAtWrk> it hardly matters unless you have tons of callbacks
[20:31:19] <cis> well if you're talking about frame drops at ~3000 entities...
[20:31:36] <DnzAtWrk> what you just described is closer to a component system

[20:32:14] *** Joins: yamchah2 (~yamchah2@user/yamchah2)
[20:32:17] <DnzAtWrk> well, at least in that direction
[20:32:45] <DnzAtWrk> ANYWAY, my tip was. You should add a priority for both updating and drawing your entities
[20:32:53] <DnzAtWrk> it is IMMENSILY useful
[20:33:12] <DnzAtWrk> IMMENSELY*
[20:33:27] <DnzAtWrk> it does mean you have to sort your entities

[20:37:27] <pyzozord> SGautam: this might be interesting http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/contents.html
[20:37:56] <pyzozord> it's not really about engine architecture, but there are interesting techniques which might come in useful
[20:39:00] <DnzAtWrk> I like to pass around a context object in most functions
[20:39:04] <DnzAtWrk> to avoid singletons
[20:39:11] <DnzAtWrk> the context contains information relevant to this instance of the game
[20:39:17] <DnzAtWrk> such as the current total time
[20:39:20] <DnzAtWrk> the current delta time

[20:39:33] <DnzAtWrk> entity.update(context) { ...
[20:40:18] <DnzAtWrk> then again, there is hardly a good reason to avoid singletons in the first place :P
[20:40:18] <SGautam> DnzAtWrk: yeah, no. I simply render to SDL2's texture.
[20:40:39] <DnzAtWrk> do your entities use a draw function then?
[20:40:42] <SGautam> SDL2 textures are hardware accelerated but all the shader trickery is probably abstracted by the libraries
[20:40:43] *** Joins: audio (~audio@2603-8081-1800-00ad-135d-ddd4-f1e4-90ef.res6.spectrum.com)
[20:40:46] <SGautam> DnzAtWrk: Yep
[20:40:51] <DnzAtWrk> then you need to sort the draw order
[20:41:23] <DnzAtWrk> int drawPriority or similiar in each entity
[20:41:46] <DnzAtWrk> and have a seperate vector with entities sorted by draw priotity
[20:41:50] <SGautam> But it's not a 3D game. The draw order is simply the order when the objects were added in. That seems a bit stupid for sure tbf. I'd thought about adding a "depth" variable inspired from game maker.
[20:41:50] <DnzAtWrk> well, I don't know how else to do it
[20:42:03] <DnzAtWrk> no no, the draw order is not that simple
[20:42:05] <DnzAtWrk> trust me on that
[20:42:18] <SGautam> Hm.. then?
[20:42:18] <DnzAtWrk> for example
[20:42:22] <DnzAtWrk> consider an isometric game
[20:42:25] <DnzAtWrk> you move behind a wall
[20:42:29] <DnzAtWrk> now the draw order is different
[20:43:18] <DnzAtWrk> this is more controversial, but I consider the same rules apply to update order
[20:43:27] <DnzAtWrk> quite often you want to force certain entities to update before other entities
[20:43:34] <DnzAtWrk> for example, you may have a camera entity tracking your player
[20:43:41] <DnzAtWrk> you want the player to update before the camera
[20:43:46] <DnzAtWrk> so the camera uses the latest player position
[20:44:00] <SGautam> Right, that's something I'd been thinking about.
[20:44:07] <DnzAtWrk> updatePriority I call it
[20:44:53] <DnzAtWrk> I just keep two lists, updateList and drawList
[20:44:56] <SGautam> The current implementation of my camera is very bad. You basically have to call the function Camera.WorldToScreen() to transform the world coordinate to screen coordinate every draw call
[20:44:58] <DnzAtWrk> sorted by update and draw priority
[20:45:08] <DnzAtWrk> updateList also acting as the "canon" list when finding entities
[20:45:24] <DnzAtWrk> that is good
[20:45:33] <DnzAtWrk> though it's not just screen coordinates
[20:45:46] <DnzAtWrk> well... no, in this case it is only screen coordinates
[20:45:55] <DnzAtWrk> you don't need to worry about the DOM :D
[20:46:21] <DnzAtWrk> Camera.WorldToScreen and Camera.ScreenToWorld
[20:46:23] <DnzAtWrk> are very useful
[20:46:50] <GeDaMo> Can't you do WorldToScreen in a shader?
[20:46:58] <DnzAtWrk> it's more about game logic really
[20:47:02] <DnzAtWrk> like, if you click somewhere
[20:47:06] <DnzAtWrk> you want to know where in the world you clicked
[20:47:20] <SGautam> GeDaMo: Is that how most game engines handle it?
[20:47:23] *** Quits: absc (~absc@81.31.144.178) (Remote host closed the connection)
[20:47:26] <DnzAtWrk> naw
[20:47:42] <SGautam> I always wondered how you distinguish between drawing world objects versus camera objects like HUD.
[20:47:59] <DnzAtWrk> https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Camera.ViewportPointToRay.html
[20:47:59] <GeDaMo> In 3D it is, don't know about 2D
[20:48:04] <DnzAtWrk> Also
[20:48:10] <DnzAtWrk> Viewport is a better term than screen
[20:48:14] <DnzAtWrk> it's technically more correct
[20:48:56] <SGautam> I'm thinking of creating a function like Camera.Enable() and Camera.Disable(). After Enable() all the Draw calls  automatically do a WorldToScreen() for you.
[20:49:05] <SGautam> Or something
[20:49:21] <DnzAtWrk> What would those do then?
[20:49:29] <DnzAtWrk> hmm
[20:49:35] <DnzAtWrk> do you map your camera straight to the screen?
[20:49:59] <DnzAtWrk> so an enabled camera renders on the screen no matter what
[20:50:01] <SGautam> No, it's mapped to a buffer. And then the buffer is drawn to the screen after stretching.
[20:50:05] <DnzAtWrk> ah
[20:50:11] <DnzAtWrk> then sure, it makes sense to disable then
[20:50:20] <SGautam> The buffer in this case is a SDL_Texture*.
[20:50:23] <DnzAtWrk> (also, allow the screen rect to be changed for fun multi-viewport stuff)
[20:50:23] <SGautam> But yeah
[20:50:33] <SGautam> Yep that is possible
[20:51:01] <DnzAtWrk> how do you move the camera?
[20:51:23] <SGautam> Manually for now. By manipulating camera.x and camera.y.
[20:51:39] <DnzAtWrk> that's fine, though having SetCenter(x, y) is also handy
[20:51:45] <SGautam> The x and y coordinates are used as offsets by WorldToScreen.
[20:51:48] <DnzAtWrk> eh, do you use a vector type?
[20:51:53] <DnzAtWrk> for 2d, 3d vectors
[20:51:55] <SGautam> Actually yeah
[20:52:02] <DnzAtWrk> then it's SetCenter(position)
[20:52:31] <DnzAtWrk> I need to go

[20:53:06] <SGautam> I have these mental flip flops between using x and y vs vector. For one SetCenter(x,y) is quick and dirty, while SetCenter(Vector2(x,y)) seems a bit too much. But using a Vector class makes it really neat.

[22:36:26] <pulse> no

[22:36:51] <pulse> it's much uglier to do it without a goto
[22:37:04] <jeaye> Rust has named loops for that. So nice.

[23:33:49] <pyzozord> do I understand it correctly that stack machine just does push(value) and pop(value), while register machine has a set(regiser, value), get(register) and there is limited number of registers?
[23:34:50] <deniska> pyzozord: a stack machine puts values on a stack and operates with them on a stack, a register machine put values in registers, and operates with them on a register
[23:34:57] <pyzozord> so stack machine is really nothing more than a stack and a for loop that reads instructions and two of those instructions are push and pop, and register machine is nothing more than a hashmap and the loop?
[23:35:13] <bjs> pyzozord: well usually pop doesn't take an argument but yes that's the idea, a stack machine uses a stack in memory instead of having registers
[23:35:19] <deniska> pyzozord: well, you'd have more instructions than push and pop
[23:35:36] <deniska> pyzozord: you probably want arithmetics of some sort, and conditional jumps
[23:36:06] <bjs> e.g. you might want an "ADD" instruction with behaviour ("pop two items of stack, add them together, push result back")
[23:36:24] <pyzozord> ok then I actually implemented both of them multiple times in the base, just never realized it
[23:36:50] <bjs> whereas in a register machine you'd have "ADD Rn, Ra, Rb" where you say "Add Ra and Rb and put the value in Rn" or something
[23:36:56] <pyzozord> and x86 assembly is both a stack and a register machine, right?
[23:37:48] <bjs> x86 is an "everything" machine
[23:37:50] <GeDaMo> It's really just a register machine although it does have a stack which is used implicitly by some instructions
[23:37:55] <bjs> but I guess it's more like a register machine than a stack one
[23:37:56] <deniska> pyzozord: most real life CPUs fall more into register machine category
[23:38:01] <pyzozord> actually even more then that x86 is stack, register and turing (free access to 1d memory array) machine all at the same time
[23:38:04] <pyzozord> ?

[23:45:00] <pyzozord> I'm not sure how authorative that is though
[23:45:43] <bjs> pyzozord: i think that's descriptive not prescriptive
[23:45:52] <GeDaMo> This is one of Chuck Moore's Forth chips, the table at the bottom of page 1 is the instruction set http://www.greenarraychips.com/home/documents/greg/PB003-110412-F18A.pdf
[23:45:56] <deniska> pyzozord: RISC/CISC is more of "you know it when you see it" thing than something specific
[23:46:02] <bjs> pyzozord: I don't see any reason why you can't have a stack machine with a "reduced instruction set";  it's just nobody makes them
[23:46:26] <GeDaMo> 32 instructions feels pretty reduced to me :P
[23:46:26] <bjs> so in practice yes, the main distinguishing feature is the number of registers

[23:46:49] <deniska> generally RISCs tend not to have many memory related operations beyond loads and stores, so it's useful to have a lot of registers
[23:47:48] <GeDaMo> In x86, you can have e.g. add [X], eax but that's really 3 operations: load X; add; store X
[23:47:52] <bjs> Right a RISC machine (e.g. Arm) would have "load" and "store" instructions to read/write memory, and then all the "real" work would be register -> register instructions (add, multiply, etc) whereas a CISC (e.g. x86) could do all of that in one instruction "load, add, store"
[23:48:02] <GeDaMo> RISC would have that as three separate instructions

[23:50:04] <pyzozord> what's an average amount of registers you can expect from average cisc (aka x86_64)? I think there is like ~10 base registers and then R1-20? So around 30 in total? How much registers is an average risc (aka arm64)?
[23:50:30] <GeDaMo> x86-64 has 16 GPRs
[23:50:42] <GeDaMo> ARM64 has 32
[23:51:31] <GeDaMo> Although on x86-64, that includes the stack pointer which is only technically general purpose :P
[23:51:38] <deniska> risc-v has 32 and 16 in embedded variant
[23:52:15] <Cyp> Plus a lot of hidden internal registers due to register renaming/pipelining or something like that.
[23:52:20] <pyzozord> ok thanks, just wanted to have a general idea so I'm not off by a factor of ten
[23:52:29] <bjs> and a bucketload of other configuration registers of course
[23:52:38] <GeDaMo> https://en.wikichip.org/w/images/7/7e/skylake_block_diagram.svg
[23:52:41] <pyzozord> Cyp: yeah but that will be "implementation detail" right? not part of the spec
[23:52:46] <GeDaMo> Also SIMD registers
[23:52:50] <deniska> and then you have floating point units with their own register sets
[23:53:17] <bjs> pyzozord: but yes A64 has 32 "general-purpose" registers  (it has lots of other registers too for special-purpose things like vector instructions and floating point and configuration)
[23:53:39] <bjs> + one stack pointer register
[23:54:02] <GeDaMo> Does ARM64 have a dedicated stack pointer?
[23:54:11] *** Quits: TP1 (~TP1@87.101.193.195) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:54:11] <bjs> It has a dedicated register called "SP"
[23:54:15] <GeDaMo> Ah
[23:54:52] <bjs> Really Arm64 only has 31 general-purpose registers because R31 doesn't really exist and often  means "SP" and you can only use it on some places
