[00:01:13] <c355E3B> Everything has something to do with containers at this point
[00:01:35] <c355E3B> I would argue that if we rolled back the container ecosystem, we would be able to drop 20% of the bloat in the linux system space
[00:02:04] <banna> I would like to one day somehow visualize software like we could visualize a mechanical thing
[00:02:53] <c355E3B> Depending on the ecosystem, you can get that
[00:10:34] <banna> Very true. I was more or less speaking of visualizing it in a way that a layperson could easily see how f'kd up it is
[00:11:44] <riv> why do containers complicate things so much?
[00:14:10] <technomancy[m]> because they attempt to address symptoms and not the root causes
[00:17:48] <banna> when phrased like that, I'm imagining a television commercial for a pharma drug with a very long common symptom disclosure
[00:18:10] <banna> "may cause lack of system memory, supply chain attacks, and general lack of effectiveness"

[02:46:47] <ivan_wagner> iDrougge, it doesn't seem to be applicable for my intention. It doesn't provide any library of elements (such as button, label, etc..)
[02:48:01] <ivan_wagner> Just some forms including buttons, labels, windows and text representing elements. Nothing fancy, I'm looking to create basic functionality draft gui for application
[02:48:48] <technomancy> it's impossible to use figma without thinking about ligma

[17:20:04] <riv> the whole idea that you should create an acount on *each and every individual* website is a huge antipattern
[17:21:45] <gerikson> riv: wait, you just don't authenticate with Facebook like everyone else?
[17:22:28] <gwozniak> Save for the fact that making an individual login identity seems to be elusive, except when tied to Facebook/Google/Apple
[17:23:51] <companion_cube> HN taught me that logging in with google is the stupidest idea
[17:23:57] <gerikson> haha
[17:23:59] <companion_cube> probably the same with FB

[17:25:30] <gerikson> well it kinda fizzled... but yeah
[17:25:49] <gwozniak> Oh, I totally remember it :)
[17:25:55] <gerikson> StackExchange pushed it pretty hard but gave up
[17:26:52] <companion_cube> because everyone prefers ExpertSexchange, sorry
[17:27:34] <gwozniak> when the tech-oriented folks don't want it, it's a bad sign
[17:27:43] <gerikson> gwozniak: so true...
[17:28:50] <epilys> ideally your email server should be your IDP
[17:29:17] <epilys> I already give my email for an account, why not use it for auth?
[17:32:34] <gerikson> great, now your online identity rests on a fragile piece of technology only wizards know how to run...
[17:32:48] <gwozniak> no way I would rely on that
[17:33:36] <epilys> why not? it could be an IMAP/JMAP extension
[17:37:26] <riv> huh  you can do linux with no ramfs

[18:29:20] <riv> is there a package manager that's not connected to any distro, and makes it easy to define packages that build binaries based on a git repo of code (which might have other deps that need built)?
[18:29:37] <riv> and maybe use some simple package def files in something like toml
[18:31:24] <gwozniak> epilys: I wouldn't want to rely on it because it's infra I have to monitor and maintain
[18:32:38] <c355E3B> epilys, have you ever tried to do email based auth in a corporate environment?

[19:04:04] <river> why chromium on phones does not support addons?
[19:04:41] <martian67> because Google isn‚Äôt interested in you installing adlock

[19:05:19] <river> but google has an ad blocker in their chromium addons store
