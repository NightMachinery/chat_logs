[14:26:58] <supermansparky> anyone knows how to get onion urls to work in andorid? it tells me cant resolve. i have turned private dns off
[14:29:42] <KaitoDaumoto> does tor require special tools? afaik it just on browser. correct me if im wrong
[14:30:45] *** Quits: supermansparky (~blagoblag@user/supermansparky) (Quit: Going offline, see ya! (www.adiirc.com))
[15:53:47] <xx> KaitoDaumoto: there are some special tools for tor, but most don't need them
[15:53:59] <xx> most in fact just run the Tor Browser, which has everything in it already
[15:56:21] <KaitoDaumoto> how about if want to host something via tor? 
[15:56:31] <KaitoDaumoto> creating servers etc for example
[16:01:38] <xx> onionshare is the easy way of doing that
[16:02:34] <xx> for the other stuff, there are lots of guides on the torproject website which show you how to run the tor binary, configure the torrc config file, run some server software like nginx and host an onion site on it
[16:04:19] <KaitoDaumoto> i see .. thanks for the info, going to check it
