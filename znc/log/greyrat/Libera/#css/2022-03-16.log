[00:06:29] <hmw[at]> Dr-007: If you want something "muted" you shouldn't call it "red". Otoh, only assigning a color is not effective anyways. Unless I missed something, such a bootstrap class seems nonsensical to me. Instead, one should assign the appropriate attributes in the markup und then style that. No need for a "muted" class

[00:31:06] <GrandMoffTarkin> I know right!

[14:38:56] *** Joins: TheSilentLink (~TheSilent@user/thesilentlink)
[14:39:57] <hmw[at]> lamein: Not sure about a CSS solution, I'll let the question ferment a little more in my brain. I guess I'd be using JS to assign a class to some parent element
[14:41:35] <lamein> yeah not sure if it's possible with pure css either
[14:41:51] <hmw[at]> lamein: Nah, I don't know a way to do it in CSS, but that doesn't mean it is impossible.
[14:42:38] <lamein> i could theoritically wrap everything up maybe and then proceed from there with a general selector such as #wrapper:hover img {}
[14:43:55] <hmw[at]> That would trigger the change not exclusively on a:hover though. If you're fine with that, that's definitively the way to go
[14:43:56] <lamein> but still no proper case for the elements that go after the image itself
[14:44:28] <lamein> yeah that also
[14:44:51] <lamein> i mean that's the problem actually
[14:44:57] <hmw[at]> Guessed so
[14:45:58] <hmw[at]> You don't happen to know a CSS solution to li:nth-child(2n), but allow for some items to become display:none, while maintaining the odd/even pattern?
[14:46:17] <lamein> nope
[14:46:29] <hmw[at]> Thanks anyways :)
[14:46:37] <lamein> haha sry im so new at this
[14:46:59] <hmw[at]> Don't worry. It will only get worse :)
[14:47:11] <lamein> what can you do, you live you learn

[14:47:35] <hmw[at]> (which is a minority position, as it seems)
[14:47:48] <lamein> im so against js for css spice however
[14:48:13] <hmw[at]> (that's the correct position :-)
[14:49:05] <hmw[at]> Dang. THis smells like there should be some weird way to achieve it, but I am already a bit tired, so thinking around the corner is a bit hard atm
[14:49:32] <lamein> i feel you, sometimes i feel a deep headache rising from cases like this
[14:51:49] <hmw[at]> .parent:has(:hover) img, but that seems not to do it
[14:52:47] <hmw[at]> oh https://caniuse.com/css-has
[14:53:05] <lamein> yeah i was looking at stackoverflow regarding the :has()

[14:55:06] <lamein> maybe that's the way?

[14:57:48] <lamein> nope don't think it is :)
[15:01:13] <hmw[at]> Hm. Sorry I couldn't help, I'm disengaging.

[15:07:25] <lamein> hmw[at]: i guess nobody's perfect, have to take the wrapper imperfection
[15:07:59] <nbjoerg> one approach is to cheat a bit
[15:08:02] <hmw[at]> tbh, should you already have JS involved, there's no shame in adding a little for this
[15:08:18] <nbjoerg> don't just mark the invisible entries as display:none, but also add a dummy element after them
[15:08:21] <hmw[at]> depends how imperfect the wrapper is
[15:08:27] <nbjoerg> and when toggling visibility, remove the dummy
[15:09:21] <lamein> any javascript spells defeat
[15:09:26] <lamein> if you imply that
[15:09:40] <hmw[at]> heheh
[15:09:47] <hmw[at]> nbjoerg: Thanks for the hint
[15:10:14] <hmw[at]> Yeah, we're actually looking for a pure CSS solution on that too, of course.
[15:10:32] <lamein> i don't think there's a CSS solution however
[15:11:50] <hmw[at]> Dang. I used to be on top of CSS a few years back
[15:13:18] <hmw[at]> Heh. Another question: There was a change in Firefox not long ago regarding line heights, all my layouts look wrong all the sudden, lines 4px taller
[15:13:42] <hmw[at]> any idea, _what_ was changed?
[15:20:39] <hmw[at]> Considering to switch from CSS to Photoshop, and upload PNGs with image maps from now on. No stability anywhere anymore.
