[13:56:22] <pussipupu> We have a garden that would be overwhelming except that we're very happy to keep bits wild, so it can be gradually brought to heel over the years
[13:57:35] <spruit11> I think my butterfly bush died and I want to get rid of the bamboo the previous owner planted.  bamboo sucks,  it's a very sturdy exotic where you need to dig a gigantic hole to get rid of the roots
[13:58:24] <spruit11> but not worth it anymore,  this neighbourhood is being replanned
[13:58:50] <arryana> the problem here is that the former owners didn't do much in the way of dealing with the garden for what appears to be more than five years
[13:58:56] <arryana> if you put a gun to my head, i'd say seven
[13:58:58] <spruit11> maybe I'll sprinkle some poppy seeds between the grass
[13:59:35] <pussipupu> Is it a buddleia? if so meadow flowers are better for the butterflies
[13:59:38] <arryana> it will be reasonable to maintain once it's brought back in order, but for the moment it's pretty epic
[14:00:27] <pussipupu> yeah the previous owners at ours were not into maintaining inside or out
[14:00:41] <arryana> the former owners here ran out of money, so they have my sympathy
[14:00:53] <arryana> but there has been a lot that was let go.
[14:01:17] <arryana> if the dogs weren't so well behaved, we'd have had to sort all the fences, which are falling apart
[14:01:29] <arryana> fortunately they respect even a cursory boundary
[14:01:59] <arryana> my first german shepherd obeyed any boundary i set, even a line drawn in dirt.
[14:02:21] <pussipupu> If we did proper fences the deer and things would struggle so we can't, but we have the land that we still have private areas
[14:02:26] <arryana> these guys aren't that good, but nearly.
[14:02:29] <arryana> ahh
[14:03:08] <pussipupu> If we manage to get a dog we might see about a fenced area depending on its behaviour
[14:03:13] <arryana> oooh
[14:03:27] <arryana> i don't worry about these two, but they're also grown now
[14:03:31] <arryana> tiny is 3 and zoe is 5
[14:03:48] <pussipupu> We're hoping to get a rescue, so it might struggle at least at first
[14:04:02] <arryana> i think that's marvelous
[14:04:15] <arryana> my first was a rescue, i just couldn't risk that with my other half never having had a dog
[14:04:42] <arryana> trying to train a new owner with a dog that isn't raised from a puppy is harder than i can manage at this stage of my life
[14:05:38] <arryana> recently someone asked us to 'rescue' a year and a half old german shepherd.  we were willing to foster to see how it went with our lot, but the owner wants 600 quid and a permanent home.
[14:05:46] <arryana> fuck that, as much as i'd like to help.
[14:05:55] <pussipupu> That's the task my spouse has to look forward to :p
[14:05:59] <arryana> hahah
[14:06:12] <arryana> my other half was too soft for a rescue
[14:06:14] <arryana> he'd be fine now.
[14:06:24] <arryana> he spoiled zoe shamefully the first two years.
[14:06:24] *** Joins: Ungwelian (Every1@88-113-45-208.elisa-laajakaista.fi)
[14:06:46] <arryana> then he realized that every time i was in the states, it was mayhem with no rules.
[14:07:04] <arryana> he tightened up significantly on his expectations of behavior, and they've been brilliant ever since.
[14:07:27] <arryana> it's hard to say who i'm prouder of, him or the dogs.
[14:07:34] <spruit11> me and my then ex,  very long time ago,  once adapted a crazy cat.  was maltreated,  potty training went wrong.  would just hold on to everything and then dump everything,  scream,  and hide somewhere
[14:07:39] <spruit11> couldn't be saved
[14:08:01] <spruit11> we ended up bringing it to a horse stable
[14:08:32] <arryana> i think the most pivotal part was when he saw that once you set the bar, the dogs live up to it.  and that the bar can be set a lot higher than 'don't chew the shoes'
[14:08:53] <arryana> the neighbors here love the girls, as they only bark when the doorbell rings, and no other time.
[14:09:33] <arryana> tiny was never much of a barker, but it was hard work to teach zoe to be quiet.

[14:14:25] <spruit11> pussipupu: yah,  that one.  think it's dead which bad for the occasional butterfly it would draw (most butterflies are dead in this country).  but the birds still seem to like it

[15:33:14] <Fohsap> Does anyone know of a really simple example of a time when it is necessary to presume something out in front in order to proove something?  I know that we see it in math all the time: "Let c be a constant and x be a variable"...  But is there a way to easily show a kindergartener, for example, that it is necessary
[15:37:41] <spruit11> an assumption isn't the same as a presumption
[15:41:37] <Fohsap> I thought presumption was more appropriate because it has to be done before the thing that follows can be shown
[15:41:44] <Fohsap> before=pre
[15:42:33] <spruit11> sure,  but you mixed the two in the previous line
[15:44:57] <spruit11> a mathematical assumption is either a restriction on what you want to discuss or precedes a case switch where you want to cover everything.  a presumption is usually a stochastic statement
[15:45:47] <spruit11> you shouldn't use 'presume' and 'let c ...' in the same sentence.  the first is presumption,  the latter starts an assumption

[20:50:45] <pussipupu> And the largely ungendered approach is much less annoying :p
[20:51:31] <pussipupu> Interestingly, most PIE languages have gendered third-person personal pronouns, whilst most languages overall do not
[20:54:25] <arryana> oooh
[20:54:40] <arryana> is it helping?
[20:54:54] <arryana> the difference, i mean

[20:55:18] <arryana> though i personally like xe/xir
[20:55:32] <arryana> it's made up, so there aren't a lot of connotations weighing it down
[20:56:08] <pussipupu> The difference itself is mostly an interesting contrast, though I think these contrasts help one think about things
[20:56:38] <pussipupu> I think the one that will win out in English is singular "they", it being so established and all
[20:57:58] <pussipupu> it's a little dissatisfying in the same way as singular "you" but that's easily solved by using "y'all" and "th'all" for the plurals :D
