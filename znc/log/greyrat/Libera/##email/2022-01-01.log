[14:56:54] <Khepra> as usual.

[19:39:39] <echoSMILE> Can someone explain how a message jumps between MX servers for a domain if some MX hosts are inaccessible ?
[19:42:36] <Khepra> can you be more specific in what you mean by "jumps"?
[19:43:13] <Khepra> if you're asking how a sender can send to a working MX in a list of several, where some aren't, that's simply the nature of having multiple MX records with optional priority, at the DNS level

[19:49:20] <echoSMILE> If the MX host with the lower priority at DNS is down, the second MX with lower priority will be reached right ?
[19:49:36] <lunaphyte> correct
[19:52:23] <echoSMILE> So, if the sender detect the MX is inaccessible it will check for another right after the detection or will wait some time or that depends of (standard) configurations ?
[19:53:34] <echoSMILE> standard I wan't to mean, what is more common in this situations.
[19:53:45] <echoSMILE> Sorry:
[19:53:55] <echoSMILE> standard I want to mean, what is more common in this situations.
[19:54:06] <Khepra> echoSMILE: what problem are you actually trying to solve?
[19:55:17] <echoSMILE> Khepra: basically I would like to setup an email server, but in case things go wrong, I want to have some redundancy for it, but I before anything I would like to understand it 
[19:55:57] <lunaphyte> i don't know if there are any declarations regarding timing that relate to mx priority, but if there were, they would probably be in rfc 5321.  have you looked there?
[19:57:24] <echoSMILE> Nop. So You are saying the next try will be right the next MX (if any) at DNS then ?
