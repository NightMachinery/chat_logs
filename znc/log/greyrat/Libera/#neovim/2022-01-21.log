[00:45:53] <irc_user> ii14[m]: Thank you! If I do `:let x = termopen("ls")` for example, it just leaves me on the terminal with process exited 0 though. Is there a way to go back to the file I was editing once the command exits?
[00:47:23] <ii14[m]> what exactly do you want to do, because it kinda sounds like terminal emulator is not what you want
[00:47:49] <ii14[m]> if you want to check if command exists, you can check it with `executable('ls')`
[00:48:41] <irc_user> I'm trying to do what `:let x = system("ls | fzf")` does in vanilla vim
[00:50:14] <ii14[m]> okay, so termopen() is asynchronous, it doesn't return the exit value of subprocess but id of the job
[00:50:26] <ii14[m]> what you want is to set on_exit callback
[00:51:05] <ii14[m]> `call termopen('ls|fzf',{'on_exit':function('s:on_exit')})`
[00:51:11] <ii14[m]> but you need to define s:on_exit
[00:51:42] <ii14[m]> function! s:on_exit(job, code, event)
[00:51:42] <ii14[m]>   echomsg 'returned' a:code
[00:51:42] <ii14[m]> endfunction
[00:53:07] <ii14[m]> see `termopen()`, `jobstart()` and `on_exit` in vim's help
[00:53:58] <ii14[m]> and by the way it's actually nicer to write it in lua
[00:54:13] <irc_user> I see, thank you!
[00:54:18] <irc_user> Oh really, I've been learning a bit of lua
[00:54:21] <irc_user> maybe I should try that instead
[00:54:37] <irc_user> I could still embed the function directly in my init.vim right?
[00:54:53] <ii14[m]> something like this in lua:... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/5c34aecb7bcc8c5847132472a8b80f4d464a0b60)
[00:55:04] <ii14[m]> yes
[00:55:09] <ii14[m]> you can do it in init.vim
[00:56:21] <ii14[m]> do you want the output too?
[00:56:23] <ii14[m]> probably yes, since it's fzf
[00:57:07] <irc_user> Yes, I just whatever file was chosen and to go back to the file I was editing
[00:57:11] <irc_user> want*
[00:57:38] <ii14[m]> you have to also define on_stdout or on_stderr callbacks then, and probably set stdout_buffered and stderr_buffered to true since you don't really care about it being asynchronous
[00:57:48] <ii14[m]> so okay, you want vim script or lua?

[08:21:08] <tmerse[m]> Id like to dabble around with lsp-creation. Can anyone point me towards what is needed to get this hello-world example to work with neovim? https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/main/lsp-sample (the example works for vscode, but in my mind there shouldn't be much needed for neovim or other lsp clients).
[08:23:34] <mjlbach[m]> I'd guess `vim.lsp.start_client({cmd = {"node", "/path/to/server.js")` would be sufficient
[08:23:41] <mjlbach[m]> after npm building that repo
[08:23:59] <mjlbach[m]> You probably also want to attach a buffer though, vim.lsp.buf_attach_client
[08:26:42] *** Joins: PortableDave (~portabled@203.87.67.190)
[08:26:50] <tmerse[m]> Thank you. Does neovim provide a simple way to Output/inspect raw json-rpc messages?
[08:27:18] <mjlbach[m]> Yup
[08:27:26] <mjlbach[m]> `:help lspconfig-logging` has more info
[08:27:45] <mjlbach[m]> rpc.send/rpc.receive are the "raw" json-rpc messages, you should see (mostly) those only at debug log level
[08:27:46] <tmerse[m]> Thanks again!
[08:27:58] <mjlbach[m]> raw meaning in lua table form
[08:28:15] <tmerse[m]> That'll do

[15:50:39] <sammie> Hi, I'm struggling getting treesitter to work with .norg files. I get an 'Error detected while processing BufEnter Autocommands for "*.norg", and lua stacktrace error starting with 'invalid node'. Updating neovim, plugins, or `:TSUpdate` does not solve the issue. Anyone brave enough to help me out?
[15:51:34] *** Joins: guido (~weechat@host-82-49-219-38.retail.telecomitalia.it)
[15:55:43] <clason[m]> I think the norg parser needs C++14 to compile; make sure your compiler is new enough to support that
[16:03:08] <sammie> gcc-11 should easily support that.. right? I initially thought that was the issue and updated from gcc-10 to gcc-11, but no cigar
[16:03:35] <clason[m]> that's the only idea I got
[16:03:59] <clason[m]> otherwise, it's just the usual: make sure you don't have outdated parsers or queries lying around
[16:06:06] <sammie> I may not be familiar with the usual. I (tried to) stick to the recommended/automatic generation part of nvim_treesitter- any particular place where I might find/fix/update/remove outdated parsers or queries?

For the most part, it works totally fine, but I'm having two kinda specific issues: the highlighting on my comments specifically is messed up (using [tokyonight](https://github.com/folke/tokyonight.nvim)) but fine other than that, and a more annoying problem is that
[18:07:12] <aelen[m]> [telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) is not working properly, like when I do `:Telescope find_files`, it just shows an empty list and an empty preview window... anyone maybe have any suggestions?

[18:10:31] <kylo252[m]> I meant, have you used it for an extended time before and there are no issues?

[18:22:13] <aelen[m]> okay something weird just happened.. I ran the docker container outside of tmux, and when I did `:Telescope find_files`, some docker desktop window popped up...
[18:22:26] <aelen[m]> so I think there may be something fucky going on with needing to give more permissions?
[18:22:31] <jaawerth> not surprised

[18:22:48] <aelen[m]> but it's just a blank window... VERY HELPFUL DOCKER, THANKS
[18:22:58] <jaawerth> multiplexers by necessity do weird things to environment variables to make everything work across different terminals and it isn't always seamless
[18:23:05] <kylo252[m]> that was my first guess as well, that's why I asked, because I think you might need to enable some caps for this to work
[18:23:45] <aelen[m]> yeah I've been using tmux for years now, and ideally I will gfet it working properly inside tmux cause that's my preferred setup... but I guess getting it working outside of tmux might be a better first goal then
[18:24:05] <jaawerth> first thing I'd check is whether your config tmux is forcibly setting TERM, and try commenting that out if it is
[18:24:16] <jaawerth> if that doesn't work you can try more complicated things ;-)
[18:24:40] <kylo252[m]> if it's just the comments then it's probably fine, I usually only drop tmux when true-color isn't working, that's where I draw the line :) 
[18:25:32] <jaawerth> I just don't use tmux except in remote sessions - though I guess if you're running it inside the docker container, that counts haha
[18:25:34] <aelen[m]> folke: ok so at least running nvim in the docker container fixes the issue with the colorscheme! So, #justtmuxthings I guess. Also, thank you for an excellent colorscheme :)

[18:26:25] <aelen[m]> yeah usually per "project" that I work on, I have a tmux session, with nvim running in the first window, second window is git/cli stuff, and then in another window I run the server or whatever it might be :)
[18:26:38] <aelen[m]> so in an ideal world... yeah, I'd love to be able to keep doing that
[18:27:07] <aelen[m]> so the colorscheme is fine then (it's italic which I set to not be the case, but whatever, I can live with that)
[18:27:17] <aelen[m]> the telescope thing, however, is still an issue - it's just showing an empty list
[18:27:29] <aelen[m]> if I use nvim-tree, I can see the contents of the directory just fine ü§î
[18:27:45] <jaawerth> I'd try this in your tmux config https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/tmux#Setting_the_correct_term
[18:27:58] <jaawerth> I don't think it should be just "xterm" from inside a tmux session
[18:28:10] <kylo252[m]> aelen[m]: did you try the tools from the cli? 
[18:28:26] <jaawerth> or this so it updates correctly depending on active session https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/tmux#Correct_the_TERM_variable_according_to_terminal_type

[18:35:52] <aelen[m]> it's set to `screen-256color|GNU Screen with 256 colors,` inside my tmux session, outside of docker
[18:36:12] <aelen[m]> I just have to afk for like ~15 mins, I'll be back! thank you all so far, this is very helpful to at least get me on the right track :)
[18:36:28] <jaawerth> wait is the tmux sessin running from within docker or from the host?
[18:36:36] <jaawerth> the one you're actually using
[18:36:41] <kylo252[m]> jaawerth: I'm not sure it's the same issue tho, true-color (mostly) needs to be explicit set, no?
[18:37:10] *** Quits: linarcx (~linarcx@151.242.188.51) (Quit: Connection closed)
[18:37:42] <jaawerth> oh, well, yeah- I wasn't specifically referring to truecolor, just with alacritty's termcap containing info that isn't portable unless the remote machine also has it in its termcap database already
[18:38:08] <jaawerth> which is probably the case unless the remote machine has alacritty installed
[18:39:59] <kylo252[m]> jaawerth: that was such a rabbit hole when I learned about it, especially since I have to use multiple machines with varying libs, PTSD..
[18:40:22] <jaawerth> lol yeah termcap is a bit of a mess, terminals could really use a standard spec
[18:40:38] <jaawerth> most of them just extend ncurses/vti/xterm in some fashion and then figure it out from there
[18:41:45] <kylo252[m]> I'm pretty sure that Home/End don't work half the time for me in Neovim when in tmux :(
[18:41:45] <kylo252[m]> but I don't have the energy to find a solution that doesn't break something else, and I don't even use `:term` that often anyway

[19:06:17] <jaawerth> yeah, if you have those plugins hop.nvim is a pretty handy way. especially since it has a 1- and 2-character version
[19:06:28] <clason[m]> oh, wait, that only works for visible matches. nevermind
[19:06:40] <jaawerth> ah
[19:08:36] <aelen[m]> <jaawerth> "wait is the tmux sessin running..." <- so my usual setup is iterm > tmux > nvim, I want to make the following cases work:
[19:08:36] <aelen[m]> - iterm > ssh (ec2, currently running alpine linux) > tmux > docker > nvim
[19:08:36] <aelen[m]> - iterm > tmux > docker > nvim
[19:08:53] <aelen[m]> so I basically would like to never run nvim outside of docker again just to be consistent in my remote and local environments
[19:09:42] <aelen[m]> but first step for me right now is to just get `iterm` > `docker` > `nvim` working completely fine, and then adding the `tmux` layer in between
[19:09:55] <aelen[m]> for which I may just nuke my entire tmux config and build it up from scratch to make sure there is no weirdness in there

[19:12:12] <mi6x3m> clason[m], thanks, hop.nvim seems quite nice
[19:12:29] <aelen[m]> another weird thing is that I need to invoke `:Telescope find_files` twice for it to work, despite the plugin being loaded at that point, so that's probably another sign that something's fucky under the hood
[19:12:35] <aelen[m]> but I'm not seeing any errors, so... idk

[19:14:38] <aelen[m]> and I just want to make it so I don't really notice whether I'm on my local machine or remote - the experience should feel the same
[19:15:02] <aelen[m]> and I actually have that for the most part (except that amazon linux ships with an ancient version of tmux, so I'm not using it atm), my previous vim config works 100% fine
