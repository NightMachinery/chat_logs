[02:48:13] <Ungwelian> It's a strange notion. Talking just for the sake of it.

[07:23:04] <Delf> Sweet dreams
[07:33:44] <causative_> there are really only 2 ironclad rules in elenchus:  answer questions, and don't get mad
[07:34:42] <causative_> "answer questions" means if someone asks you about what you believe, or what you mean by something, or why you believe it, you place the highest priority on giving the clearest and most direct answer you can
[07:35:11] <Delf> But what about questions? You got to ask questions
[07:36:24] <Delf> First is ask question, second is answer question, third is get furiously mad, deal with it internally, don't keep the other one waiting and answer them, in good faith
[07:36:28] <causative_> "don't get mad" means you don't insult the other person, try to put them down, call their claims crazy or stupid or ridiculous, or try to hurt them in any other way except from questioning their beliefs and pointing out inconsistencies and disagreements
[07:36:48] <causative_> asking questions is optional Delf
[07:37:15] <causative_> if you never ask a question, but do answer questions when asked, you can still be a good contributor to elenchus
[07:37:16] <Delf> I disagree with you because elenchus cannot exist without questions
[07:38:01] <causative_> at least one person needs to be asking questions for it to be elenchus, but it's not breaking the rules if the other person doesn't
[07:38:04] <Delf> I hope that doesn't make you feel bad, because if it does, I can consider agreeing with you
[07:38:45] <Delf> This is true. Both do not need to ask questions
[07:39:14] <Delf> One can be actively inquiring and the other can be actively trying to respond in as clear manner as possible without getting emotional
[07:39:46] <causative_> yes, that's elenchus
[07:40:10] <Delf> Yes, it does not break the rules but it's also not enough rules to make elenchus. You can't rely on me having to ask questions
[07:40:31] <Delf> I'm told... I'm not someone to rely on
[07:41:29] <Delf> This is interesting indeed. Is this why I don't catch you asking too many questions?
[07:41:43] <causative_> I do ask a bunch of questions
[07:41:54] <Delf> You do... Maybe to your own standards
[07:42:14] <Delf> When was the last time you asked me how I'm doing? Nobody gives a fuck about me! :(
[07:42:25] <causative_> how are you doing?
[07:42:35] <Delf> Ok, so once every... ever
[07:42:57] <causative_> elenchus is a particular type of question - asking someone what they believe and why
[07:43:23] <Delf> In any case. Having mastered emotions and become totally inhuman in that sense, I move on to questions because this is what I consider to be important for elenchus
[07:44:14] <Delf> Where as you're a human and you do your best to not let emotions get in the way of elenchus
[07:44:58] <causative_> there are positive things we can do to improve the quality of elenchus - asking good questions, being clear in our explanations, creatively examining the ideas from multiple perspectives
[07:45:20] <causative_> I'm not talking about those when I talk about the "ironclad rules": answer questions, don't get mad
[07:45:21] <Delf> Indeed
[07:45:32] <Delf> Let me look up ironclad
[07:45:36] <causative_> the ironclad rules are negative rules - things we ought not to do. Don't refuse to answer questions, don't get mad.
[07:46:11] <causative_> if you don't do the positive things that well, then the discussion just isn't that great, but if you break the ironclad rules then there is no discussion
[07:46:37] <Delf> You do realize that it's a huge ask? The second part
[07:46:55] <causative_> shouldn't be
[07:47:04] <Delf> Don't get mad... Like... I can't help but get fucking furious mate, it's not exactly my doing
[07:47:34] <causative_> oh, well, it's okay to get mad privately as long as you don't let it spill out to ridiculing the other person or his views
[07:47:56] <Delf> Emotions are outside of my domain. If they were inside, I would be spamming certain specific emotions rendering myself totally busy and essentially disabled
[07:48:06] <causative_> question and refute, not ridicule or dismiss
[07:48:19] <Delf> Fucking right! This is progress, I love it
[07:49:49] <Delf> I have another rule and that is L42, it says... understand, protect and preserve. In that order.
[07:50:26] <causative_> good things to try to do
[07:50:56] <Delf> Yaa, I been accused of being a robot and emotionless too... which makes me sad
[07:52:09] <Delf> But this enelchus, I like a lot. It is in accordance with the first part of L42
[07:53:30] <Delf> It's even included in K42. Which says understand, destroy and commit extinction
[07:54:33] <Delf> Lets go back to the emotions. When I get furious, it's very hard to even maintain an intention to reach elenchus
[07:55:25] <Delf> Actually, I don't even have to get furious. The second I get slightly irritated, I'll abandon elenchus
[07:56:39] <Delf> Because, I'm an assholes like that. It doesn't take much at all for me to consider it total fucking useless of time and energy to spend on elenchus with certain people. But here comes the iron... I have noooooooo problem spending a ton more energy on HATiNG at them. See the problem?

[16:03:23] <arryana> human beings have more or less always had to hunt, gather, grow, make textiles, etc.  i'm not at all sure that not doing so is an advantage.
[16:06:51] <arryana> much like pussipupu and i were discussing yesterday, how depression makes a person indifferent to the state of their surroundings, being required by necessity to do things in order to survive may have been a good thing for mental health.
[16:11:06] <arryana> i wish i could remember the quote from 'the good earth' on the topic.  the farmer's eldest son (who is idle and does not have to work) begins having rages and moods and the farmer wondered why he had never had the same issue in his youth.  he comes to the conclusion that he was too busy to focus on such things, and if he had acted on such emotions he'd have gone home and had nothing to
[16:11:06] <arryana> eat.

[22:25:38] <causative_> an argument for believing something is also a causal graph; the graph asserts that initially holding the premises will cause you to hold the conclusion, if you are reasonable
[22:26:22] <causative_> we may have more complicated argument diagrams, e.g. A,B,C -> D,  E,F->G,  H,D->I
[22:27:03] <causative_> this is an assertion that initially holding A,B,C causes you to conclude D, that holding E,F causes you to conclude G, and that holding H,D causes you to conclude I
[22:27:12] <causative_> and maybe add I,G -> J
[22:27:59] <causative_> then the conclusion of the whole argument would be J, and overall the assertion is that initially holding A,B,C,E,F,H, causes you to conclude J, via considering the steps of the argument
[22:29:31] <causative_> and I assert that the notion of a causal graph of beliefs, whereby holding initial beliefs leads you to later ones, is *more fundamental* than the notion of a valid argument (valid argument meaning deductive inference)
[22:30:03] <causative_> because the notion of a causal graph of beliefs also generalizes to informal (non-formally-valid) arguments
[22:31:42] <causative_> when we weigh evidence and say "On the balance of evidence, A, B, C generally means D," this is not a valid argument because D does not necessarily follow. But it can still be understood as a causal belief graph, whereby believing A,B,C initially would lead a reasonable person to think D is probably true, as a conclusion.
