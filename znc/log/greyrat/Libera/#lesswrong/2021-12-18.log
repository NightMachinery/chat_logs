[03:08:22] <adiabatic> speaking of covid
[03:08:28] <adiabatic> I smelled things at the grocery store
[03:08:41] <adiabatic> does that mean my n95 is failing me
[03:10:37] <ggreer> you probably aren't getting a good seal. it's pretty hard to breathe in an N95 mask
[03:10:42] <MrFantastik> an n95 doesn't filter all particulates either
[03:11:31] <MrFantastik> its like 95 not 100 so i guess it could be trace amounts
[03:11:51] <adiabatic> Breathing in a definitely-well-sealed N100 takes a little bit of work
[03:12:02] <adiabatic> my N95 and 100 have out holes, though
[03:12:28] <MrFantastik> I can smell in my n95's but maybe i don't wear it correctly too
[03:12:29] <adiabatic> N95's is pluggable, but why should I bother when I almost never get out and other people give way fewer fucks (chin diapers, etc.) than I do
[03:13:01] <saturn2> volatile substances won't be reliably filtered, only liquid or solid particles
[03:13:05] <adiabatic> I wear https://envomask.com so I can get a good seal on my face assuming I've shaved in the past week and I'm not looking down

[03:15:14] <PlanckWalk> You'll definitely smell stuff in laundry or toiletries aisles.
[03:17:59] <adiabatic> the other possibliity is that my filter is just too damn old and needs changing because the static charge broke down after like two months
[03:18:02] <PlanckWalk> I also noticed very strong smells of cleaning products where they sanitized checkouts.
[03:18:36] <PlanckWalk> Like, overpowering stench of not-quite-sure what, smelled something like isopropyl alcohol mixed with something else.
[03:19:14] <PlanckWalk> A lot of it is vapours, not particles.
[03:20:02] <saturn2> i wouldn't recommend using the same filter for two months
[03:20:04] <adiabatic> but isn't everything particles if you shrink them down enough
[03:20:16] <PlanckWalk> Filter masks don't stop vapours at all
[03:20:28] <PlanckWalk> It's particles in the same way that oxygen is particles :-p

[03:36:09] <ggreer> maybe you're recovering from covid :P

[03:37:02] <adiabatic> what have they blocked

[06:03:23] <catern> I want to post about cryonics on work Slack for selfish reasons as outlined in https://www.overcomingbias.com/2021/12/we-dont-have-to-die.html
[06:03:24] <Robomot> Overcoming Bias : We Don’t Have To Die
[06:03:27] <catern> is that a bad idea y/n
[06:03:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> y
[06:03:41] <catern> how many people in #lesswrong are even signed up for cryonics?
[06:06:10] <gwern> not many. we tend to be younger and not really hardcore transhumanists
[06:06:36] <catern> sad!
[06:06:45] <gwern> and there's lots of good reasons to not bother with cryonics. it really only makes sense if you are either very old or some old-school believer in 'oh, the singularity won't happen this side of 2100'
[06:07:12] <gwern> if your life expectancy is out >2060 like most people here...
[06:07:22] <catern> that specifically seems like an incredibly weak reason
[06:07:59] <catern> staking your life on "the singularity is near"...
[06:08:05] <gwern> really? seems like a great reason to me. one way or another, any investment sunk into cryonics is probably going to be wasted, and the cost of cryonics is the same no matter when you pay for it
[06:08:24] <gwern> life insurance isn't 'cheap', it's just spreading the cost out and hiding the opportunity cost
[06:08:43] <gwern> personally, I'm extremely glad I've held on to the money instead of sinking it into whole or worse, term, life insurance
[06:09:57] <catern> shrug, I'm not really concerned about the price so I won't debate on that point
[06:10:05] <gwern> I have enough money/assets to fund cryonics if I decide to, and it's still a bad idea given that dying by accident (currently about the only way I'd go), I'd be on ice for days before I ever got near arizona
[06:10:34] <catern> that's fair
[06:11:12] <gwern> (or by homicide, but that would be even worse from a cryosuspension pov. forget about being vitrified any time that month!)
[06:12:39] <gwern> basically, I don't see any reason I should actively sign up barring either (a) it turns 2040 and it's clear that we're in a historical scenario where cryonics is at all feasible or (b) I suddenly develop a terminal but sufficiently slow disease that I can relocate to arizona or otherwise arrange extremely rapid transportation
[06:13:19] <catern> you live pretty far from an airport I guess
[06:13:55] <catern> if I died by accident in NYC I think transport to Alcor could be pretty fast
[06:14:05] <gwern> oh yeah. even the tiniest thing you could still call an airport is at least 50 minutes away. any real airport you could feasibly arrange corpse transport to arizona through is at least 2 hours
[06:14:47] <gwern> and I fully assume that in the case of an accident or homicide, it'd be days before the corpse was released, after spending hours at room temperature before any refrigerator
[06:14:53] <catern> ah that's not too bad, I thought it was more rural than that (but it's new england so I guess there's a limit on how anti-dense it can be...)
[06:15:36] <gwern> I believe in cryonics, but it's already barely on the edge of feasibility, and I don't quite believe in tiplerian magic in inferring me from brain soup after days/weeks of relatively-high-temp decay
[06:15:53] <catern> I don't know, 2k (spread over $200/yr for 10 years) is enough to pay for term life for the next 10 years
[06:16:08] <catern> seems pretty worth it to me
[06:16:20] <catern> even with the low risk of payoff
[06:18:49] <catern> at the very least, a cryonics medical bracelet is the kind of luxury jewelery that is appealing to me to buy :)

[08:00:26] <feepbot> <gwern> 'This explanation considers the forces exerted on solution molecules in the neighborhood of an aquaporin protein or other membrane-bound water channel (Box 1 and Figure 1). The key interactions take place in the small region of space adjacent to a pore aperture that allows water molecules to pass but repels solute (yellow semicircles in Figure 1). Each time a solute
[08:00:26] <feepbot> molecule enters this region, it is repelled. That is, the aperture gives to the solute molecule a small amount of momentum directed away from the membrane. Due to viscous interactions between solute and water, this momentum is rapidly shared among all nearby molecules, including both solute and water (for dissolved ions, the time scale for momentum sharing is approximately 10–12
[08:00:26] <feepbot> s [17]). Thus, although the pore aperture repels only the solute, the net effect is a force directed away from the membrane acting on the solution as a whole. This is the counterintuitive idea at the center of osmotic theory: a pore that lets water molecules pass freely will effectively repel the water if solute is present. If there are different concentrations of solute at either
[08:00:31] <feepbot> end of the pore, this can produce an unbalanced force that drives water through the pore into the compartment with more solute.' http://umdberg.pbworks.com/w/file/fetch/65882794/Osmosis-Kramer&Myers-PlantSci.pdf#page=2 is my whole life a lie

I am a former apprentice who trained at OAK, the Monastic Academy’s branch in Berkeley, CA. This letter contains details about my experience at OAK…)
[10:14:31] <saturn2> i get chills every time someone uses the word "policymakers"
[10:14:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> "The teacher I studied under had only been training and practicing for 3 years before starting OAK (then a year old). While on this retreat this teacher whom I loved displayed signs of psychological distress and mania after a period of 2–3 months of isolation, severe sleep deprivation, and fasting while on solo retreat under the supervision and teachings of Soryu Forall. ... To my knowledge, the Monastic Academy still has
[10:14:40] <Obormot\Arcturus>  not acknowledged or taken responsibility for the impact of having pre-maturely placed enormous responsibility and pressure on him that would be considered highly inappropriate in any other monastic environment."
[10:14:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> Let's be clear, though: this is actually a deliberate policy of theirs
[10:15:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> They specifically make a point of putting responsibility in the hands of people who aren't ready or qualified for it
[10:15:31] <quanticle> saturn2: Just consider it a reminder of the existence of the deep state
[10:15:46] <quanticle> A reminder that the people you elect are *not* makers of policy
[10:16:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> (This is not conjecture, it comes from one the previous iterations of these "actually Monastic Academy is terrible" reports, of which there are by now a whole bunch)
[10:16:37] <phill> Is this one of those "meditation" things where they also do hallucinogens
[10:17:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> Maybe but that's not even necessary
[10:17:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> Meditate and sensory-deprive and whatnot hard enough and it's the same effect

[10:17:53] <phill> I remember Tim Ferriss talked about a silent retreat he went on where he apparently had a "psychotic break" from silent meditation. He didn't mention he was also fasting and doing high doses of hallucinogens. 
[10:17:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> "I think [the bad things described in the post] happened in part because the person in question was bad at their job. That’s not a surprise or even really a criticism, given the monastery’s explicit, deliberate policy of placing people in jobs they’re bad at to facilitate personal growth."

[19:20:09] <shawwwn> yes, buckets are actually-costly, and they run the risk of lots of egress bandwidth if you're not careful, so you'll need to make your own GCP project and put the bucket there

[19:24:25] <gwern> nshepperd: sure, but then how does anyone download?
[19:24:25] <nshepperd> ok
[19:24:55] <gwern> the basic problem is that GCP screws you on bandwidth, and you need to be elsewhere like hezner/ovh etc with competitive prices
[19:25:07] <nshepperd> gwern: well i was wondering if it could be configured so you can only download from the same region or sth

[19:25:36] <gwern> nshepperd: hm. probably but I don't know offhand. if you wanted to restrict to within-cloud operation, then 'requester pays' is also an option for AWS and I *think* gcp
[19:26:01] <gwern> meant for scenarios like this, exploiting the built-in micropayments billing of being within-cloud

[19:26:16] <nshepperd> ahh
[19:26:43] <gwern> PapuaHardyNet: I dunno, does sshfs do anon ssh? otherwise, http or rsync or something make more sense for public access
[19:27:23] <shawwwn> there is no way to prevent egress bandwidth from a bucket. requester pays is an option, but that implies that there's some kind of annoying configuration step
[19:27:48] <shawwwn> and if you're already setting up a billing account, it makes more sense for you to pay for the bucket storage fees than for someone else to keep it around indefinitely
[19:27:56] <PapuaHardyNet> The point is to read data directly from a remote, right? http and rsync cannot do that

[19:32:33] <shawwwn> if your goal is simply to train on a massive amount of text, just download http://test.tensorfork.com:1234/openwebtext-ftfy.tok16 and decode it. each token is two bytes

[21:15:02] <gwern> kiboneu: sure. typical amphetamine trap. motivation, but not judgment. but if you really did work 16h/day 7 days a week, wasting some of it on irc would, in the end, not be that big a deal
[21:15:12] <kiboneu> that's right!
[21:15:39] <kiboneu> i value leisure and work too much so sleep can leave
[21:15:45] <gwern> you would still accomplish vastly more over a lifetime than your current self where after 3h of work, the limiters kick in and try to divert you to other activities
[21:16:00] <quanticle> I see. But has he considered the possibility that it's a good thing that the average human is so demotivated? Conscientiousness without IQ results in people working very hard... and making the world worse for everyone around them.
[21:16:12] <kuudes> you could have perpetually clean apartment and clean dishes and folded clothes
[21:16:39] <kiboneu> kuudes: i did a major re-org
[21:16:45] <gwern> quanticle: I mean, the world has gotten better over time, not worse, due to people working, and not due to aliens dropping off annual presents. so the average effect of work must be positive
[21:17:01] <kiboneu> so stuff in boxes now laid out on tables and categorized, but i lack the smaller boxes to fit all of this stuff
[21:17:17] <kiboneu> it was starting to piss me off
[21:17:22] <quanticle> You don't need to be in the 99th percentile of conscientiousness to have a clean house and folded clothes. You just need to be out of the bottom 10%, i.e. not be a rationalist.

[21:19:30] <gwern> nor do you need any new genes either

[21:22:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> Boy they had some wild ideas back in '93
[21:22:58] <gwern> quanticle: they are independent pretty precisely, but you can get correlations depending on the population due to stuff like berkson's paradox

[21:23:31] <kiboneu> Obormot\Arcturus: (wait 20 more years man)
[21:24:23] <quanticle> gwern: Okay, that answers my implied question. I was wondering, if IQ and conscientiousness were currently correlated, if there would be any deleterious effects of breaking that correlation, but they're not correlated, so it shouldn't matter.

But now it has been called out on these acts in a publication closely aligned with the Russian government."
[21:51:24] <two2thehead> huh. The natives are getting restless
[21:52:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> This IRC library is like ... "multiple connections are supported. with select(). but don't actually do that because it sucks. FAQ question: what if I want to use epoll instead? Answer: well then you'd have to write some more code lol."
[21:52:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> Thanks dude, very helpful!
[21:52:25] <quanticle> I just saw a Petsmart ad on the TV, and it showed a cat actually playing with the toy its owner purchased it, as opposed to the box that the toy came in.

[21:53:06] <two2thehead> 'The article, translated for Ars by Rob Mitchell, is titled "The Space Program Is Rotting from Within."

[22:21:58] <kuudes> there are only so many times you can tenfold daily infection amount
[22:25:32] <two2thehead> point
[22:25:57] <kuudes> if it follows logistic sigmoid, you can model it that up to 3% of population it follows exponential growth, 10x is ~2 logits. then 1 logit is to 25% and 1 logit to 50% and then 1 logit to 75% and then 1 logit to 90% and then exponential diminishing, each 2 logits divides the leftover by 10
[22:27:00] <kuudes> so I guess if you know current tenfolding pace and the total amount, you can model it quite well by halving the total and putting 50% to that day, and then move forward and backward as mentioned above
[22:27:23] <kuudes> this is because exp(1) ~ 3 and exp(2) ~10
