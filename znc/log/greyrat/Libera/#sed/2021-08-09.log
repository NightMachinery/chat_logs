[15:05:30] <tsujp> I'm trying to unpack just what is going on here `sed "/^menuentry \"Void Linux $zversion\" [{]\$/,/[}]/d"` where zversion is the string "5[.]13[.]8_1"
[15:05:31] *** Joins: psydroid (~psydroid@user/psydroid)
[15:05:43] <tsujp> but if I try and run that I get `sed: -e expression #1, char 2: unknown command: `['`
[15:06:57] <tsujp> hmm now it runs but my shell hangs waiting for more input
[15:08:35] <tsujp> hold up is that a regular expression? `/^menuentry \"Void Linux $zversion\" [{]\$/,` is the first part and `/[}]/` is the latter part?
[15:09:54] <geirha> sounds like zversion does not contain what you think it does. My guess is it contains slashes
[15:10:20] <geirha> put echo in front to see what sed actually gets after the regex has been injected into sed
[15:10:45] <tsujp> i've ran this with set -x though which shows `ZVERSION=5[.]13[.]8_1`
[15:11:59] <tsujp> so echo the line before sed is called yields `5[.]13[.]8_1`
[15:12:20] <tsujp> I don't understand what command is being run here for sed though, I don't know of anything called just `//` in the man page
[15:12:26] <tsujp> like, it's not `s//`
[15:13:14] <geirha> why did the variable name suddenly become uppercase?
[15:13:18] <geirha> # zversion=5[.]13[.]8_1; sed "/^menuentry \"Void Linux $zversion\" [{]\$/,/[}]/d" <<< 'all good'
[15:13:19] <shbot> geirha: all good
[15:13:34] <geirha> anyway, unable to reproduce with the information provided so far ^
[15:13:41] <tsujp> I changed it between my bad hehe it's the same thing though
[15:14:03] <geirha> humour me with the echo then.  echo sed "/^menuentry ...
[15:14:10] <tsujp> Okay well my first question is what sed command is being run here because I don't know what it's doing, this isn't `sed s/foo/bar/` 
[15:15:06] <tsujp> and it's not `sed y/foo/bar/` and `man sed` doesn't show anything for `sed /foo/bar/`
[15:16:48] <tsujp> geirha: http://ix.io/3vrP
[15:17:01] <geirha> also, it's saying expression #1 char 2, but char 2 is "^" in. Are you sure the error is produced by that particular sed?
[15:17:22] <tsujp> https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/blob/master/srcpkgs/refind/files/kernel.post-install#L36geirha: script source: 
[15:17:31] <tsujp> borked link, link is https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/blob/master/srcpkgs/refind/files/kernel.post-install#L36
[15:20:30] <geirha> no syntax errors in any of those seds
[15:20:34] <Riviera> tsujp: That's code injection btw.
[15:20:54] <geirha> perhaps you're running a different script by accident
[15:20:55] <tsujp> i think we're talking past each other here, I'm no longer concerned with the error `but if I try and run that I get `sed: -e expression #1, char 2: unknown command: `['`` I just want to know what it's doing in english because I am reading the man page but I don't understand what's going on still
[15:21:49] <geirha> it won't produce that error message
[15:22:05] <tsujp> Right I get that let's start again
[15:22:23] <tsujp> `sed /s/foo/bar/` replaces `foo` with `bar`
[15:22:26] <tsujp> That command does what?
[15:22:27] <Riviera> (The content of zversion is user-provided. GNU sed can execute arbitrary code on Linux.)
[15:22:38] <geirha> that's gibberish
[15:22:39] <Soliton> # sed /s/foo/bar/
[15:22:41] <shbot> Soliton: sed: -e expression #1, char 4: unknown command: `f'
[15:22:55] <tsujp> # sed s/foo/bar/
[15:23:02] <shbot> tsujp: no output within the time limit
[15:23:29] <Soliton> the s command replaces whatever matches the left hand side regex with the right hand side.
[15:24:13] <tsujp> Yes right but I am asking what the command:            sed "/^menuentry \"Void Linux $zversion\" [{]\$/,/[}]/d"           does because it doesn't look like any form I can see documented in the man page. What thing in the man page describes what is going on here
[15:24:30] <geirha> # sed ' ['
[15:24:32] <shbot> geirha: sed: -e expression #1, char 2: unknown command: `['
[15:24:36] <tsujp> e.g. `s/regex/replacement/` is in the man page. I don't see anything called just `/whatever/` in the man page
[15:24:38] <geirha> there's your error message
[15:24:38] <Soliton> it's the d command with an address range.
[15:24:51] <tsujp> Again, there is no more error message
[15:24:55] <tsujp> Okay the d command with address range
[15:24:58] <geirha> /whatever/ is an address
[15:25:29] <geirha> and on a side note. I'd just use awk instead of sed there
[15:25:53] <tsujp> My experience with `awk` and `sed` are minimal, trying to understand what is going on here to replace or keep
[15:26:01] <tsujp> Reading up on the `d` command now
[15:26:47] <geirha> whatever is going on, it's not in the code you've showed us

[16:31:04] <tsujp> why is `[{]` being used in my example before, if that is a range expression then `[{]` is regex for a list but if the list only has one item and `{` in sed doesn't require escaping why not just `{`?
[16:32:22] <geirha> { and [{] will match the same in BRE, yes
[16:32:48] <Soliton> maybe the author was worried someone will randomly switch to ERE or something.

[16:34:09] <geirha> the ones used by awk and grep -E
[16:35:16] <tsujp> https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/html_node/BRE-vs-ERE.html#BRE-vs-ERE
[16:35:26] <tsujp> heh so `\{` means something different in BRE and ERE
[16:35:29] <tsujp> fair enough
[16:35:59] <tsujp> if this is a literal command in a config file I don't see why it would need to be provided, it's not like anyone would manually edit that file and add `-E` and if they did it's up to them to keep it working
[16:36:03] <tsujp> Cool little hack though
[16:37:08] <geirha> people that are used to perl style regular expressions tend to find the standard regex dialects confusing, and they do weird hacks to work around problems that aren't problems
[16:37:15] <tsujp> so that sed command looks for a line starting `menuentry Void Linux $zversion {` and deletes that line until `}`
[16:37:38] *** Joins: Torr (~Torr@user/torr)
[16:37:40] <tsujp> I think the regex I know most of is whatever Javascript uses
[16:37:49] <tsujp> What's the most standard dialect in use today?
[16:40:05] <geirha> Can't imagine any reasonable way to measure it
[16:40:24] <tsujp> I guess that is a fairly loose question hehe
[16:41:09] <tsujp> oh hey that thing being a regular expression explains the `[.]` stuff in `$zversion`
[16:41:17] <tsujp> could've just done `\.` instead for a literal `.`
[16:42:20] <geirha> yes
[16:42:35] <tsujp> what an adventure understanding this script has been... now onto the awk stuff
