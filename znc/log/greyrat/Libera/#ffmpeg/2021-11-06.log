[00:04:14] <DeHackEd> based on the source, I think nvenc is implemented as a "normal" encoder, not an hw encoder. unless you want to do some cuda-style things along with it.
[00:09:07] <BtbN> nvenc can take sw and hw frames
[00:09:30] <IHaveManyQuestio> So I can just change my encoder to nvenc and it will just work?
[00:10:15] <BtbN> Depends on what options you set. It's not a drop-in for libx264

[00:14:43] <BtbN> That's an ffmpeg.c option.
[00:14:52] <BtbN> Nvenc will work with just -c:v h264_nvenc.

[01:27:32] <brimestone> Can you have a look see and point out anything that is Glaring? https://pastebin.com/raw/HeVySMJf
[01:28:10] <BtbN> That's a ton of inputs
[01:28:28] <brimestone> Sometimes we get 16 audio and 1 video tracks
[01:29:09] <BtbN> Do all those files have a video stream?
[01:29:38] <BtbN> But I can easily see a commandline like that being stupidly inefficient
[01:29:44] <BtbN> ffmpeg.c is not at all multithreaded
[01:29:44] <brimestone> No.. just 1 of those files is a video track.. then the rest are audio tracks that we mix.
[01:29:58] <BtbN> so the slowest of the bunch will limit the whole process
[01:30:42] <BtbN> And it will also be a ton of very random IO, so it can easily overwhelm your disk
[01:31:14] <brimestone> Disk is not an issue.. This is on a SAN type storage.. with about 200 spinning disk.
[01:32:35] <BtbN> Network storage could also easily be the limit
[01:32:43] <BtbN> It has a tendency to suck
[01:32:58] <BtbN> in any case, you'll have to use your OS usual toold to analyze where it's stuck.
[01:33:09] <BtbN> And I have no clue about MacOS, so you'll have to figure that out
[01:33:26] <brimestone> Yeah.. thanks.. the mystery continues.
[01:33:46] <brimestone> But, you'd suggest going back to libx264 over h264 ?
[01:33:59] <BtbN> Like I said, "h264" is no specific encoder
[01:34:14] <BtbN> it's basically random which encoder you get
[01:34:30] <brimestone> Ok.. I'm switching it back..
[01:34:46] <brimestone> Might be the reason why I lost ability to stick timecode into the format track
[01:34:49] <BtbN> If you only got libx264, it'll probably be that
[01:35:11] <BtbN> But it makes no sense to not know which encoder you get, since they all have different options
[01:35:53] <brimestone> I only have 2, libx264 and h264_videotoolbox

[11:47:43] <sqz1> interesting, I thought that HRTF was just an encoding to (re)position spatial based on your headmovements which universally applies to all humans...didn't know there are ear-specific inputs too
[11:48:26] <haasn> no it's absolutely not universal and using the wrong HRTF for your ears will make it sound terrible
[11:48:33] <haasn> even the shape of your head is not universal
[11:48:57] <haasn> you can find online existing databases of dozens of HRTFs to try plugging in in the hopes that one will work
[11:49:19] <sqz1> ah ok, vision (VR) has the same issue with interpupilary distance not being same for each human..can cause a great or horrible experience as well

[11:51:29] <haasn> that one is at least very easy to measure in a mirror and plug it into the HMD

[11:52:38] <sqz1> in the future, ideally everybody would have a qr code with his/her interpupilary distance and hrtf embedded

[19:00:41] <bartzy> specifically I'm interested in how many bytes ffprobe downloads when given a remote HTTP URL
[19:02:19] <JEEB> current master in the verbose verbosity level or higher at the end does note the bytes read and written into the main AVIOContext
[19:02:57] <bartzy> and the bytes read are the bytes downloaded?

[19:04:20] <JEEB> if it only reads the header, sure?
[19:04:47] <bartzy> didn't know the header is around 500KB, I thought it's much smaller
[19:05:06] <JEEB> well, it might actually utilized less. and in some cases some data is then read for informational purposes
[19:05:24] <JEEB> also many have moov at the end so you first read the beginning and then request another set of data from the end of the file
[19:05:45] <JEEB> and then there might be some minimum amount of data that AVIO will request
[19:06:04] <JEEB> because if you request less the possibility of you requesting then more is high enough

[19:10:27] <JEEB> you could attempt to optimize, but not sure if worth it :P
[19:10:28] <furq> if the moov is at the start it shoudln't do any seeking
[19:10:36] <JEEB> well seeks was zero
[19:10:59] <furq> i would assume it just reads until it finds either moov or mvhd and then tries the end if it found mvhd
[19:11:30] <furq> but maybe there are wackier mp4s out there
[19:12:15] <bartzy> I have some mov files in S3 (AWS) that I upload. I later need their duration in seconds, FPS, number of frames. I'm considering if it's better to set these in the S3 object metadata or just read them when I need them (one-time)
[19:15:10] <bartzy> I think I'll just read with ffprobe

[23:26:28] <zak_> Hi. I'm trying to decode some binary audio. I believe it's Sonix's audio32 codec. I have reason to believe that this is similar to G722_1 codec. Is there a way I can reverse engineer the codec?
[23:27:19] <durandal_1707> zak_: does vgmstream supports it?
[23:27:31] <JEEB> either you have enough experience that you can just look at the data and poke at it with various algorithms. if not, you'll probably need to ghidra or so the official decoder
[23:27:43] <JEEB> and yea durandal_1707 gives a good hint
[23:28:38] <zak_> Not sure about vgmstream. I don't see it on the supported list
[23:29:29] <zak_> Does ghidra assume that I have the decoding binary code?
[23:29:57] <zak_> Or does ghidra have commonly used audio codec tools to manipulate data?

[23:33:48] *** Joins: hendursaga (~weechat@user/hendursaga)
[23:33:49] <zak_> I actually don't have the decoding binary code. It's on an embedded device
[23:36:35] <JEEB> ghidra is a reverse engineering tool. you'd have to have your own toolset for doing experiments on just the data
[23:36:44] <JEEB> I mean, you can modify bits of libavcodec for that need
[23:36:53] <JEEB> but you'd have to figure out how exactly to do that
[23:37:24] <zak_> ok thanks

[23:40:50] <durandal_1707> zak_: whats bitrate of audio?
[23:41:11] <durandal_1707> is it variable bitrate
[23:41:17] <durandal_1707> is it like ADPCM?

[23:58:24] <aphysically> huh this is a new one
[23:58:25] <aphysically> [dash @ 0x562b75f08a00] sample rate not set
[23:59:34] <aphysically> it's a copy'd stream is there a way to tell it the samplerate?
