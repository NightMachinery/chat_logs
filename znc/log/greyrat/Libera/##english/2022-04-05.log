[00:02:44] <TimMc> Northern Ireland is part of the UK; Great Britain is the island. ("Britain" by itself is ambiguous.)
[00:02:54] <TimMc> I think I've got that right.
[00:02:57] <blkshp> Britain is the island.
[00:03:05] <blkshp> There is no ambiguity about that.
[00:03:10] <CuriosTiger> "Britain" by itself can also confusingly mean Brittany, in France. Or at least it could historically.
[00:03:35] <blkshp> Well... c'mon... French.

[00:05:20] <CuriosTiger> until I got one of those Venn diagrams.
[00:05:41] <CuriosTiger> I'm still a bit fuzzy on the status of places like the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.
[00:06:50] <CuriosTiger> but at least I know "Great Britain" is the island, "the United Kingdom" is the country and it has four constituent members that are also confusingly called countries. Or nations. Or something. I just call them England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. And then I feel a bit sorry for Cornwall.

[00:19:27] <CuriosTiger> In most other countries, you have one type of passport. You're either a citizen or you're not.
[00:20:20] <CuriosTiger> The UK has British Citizen, British Overseas Territories Citizen, British Overseas Citizen, British Protected Person, British National and British Subject. Not all of these are in active use any longer, but several of them still are.

[00:23:50] <blkshp> I had no idea.
[00:24:08] <blkshp> Not even sure where my passport is
[00:24:13] <CuriosTiger> blkshp: I mean, it's obviously a legacy of the British Empire. But it's interesting that it persists.
[00:24:31] <blkshp> Well there is still, just about, a commonwealth
[00:24:56] <CuriosTiger> Sure, but every other Commonwealth country now issues a passport in that country's name, just about.
[00:25:12] <CuriosTiger> Ie. you can have a Canadian passport or an Australian passport, whereas those used to be British passports.
[00:25:32] <CuriosTiger> British Citizen is the only one that automatically grants a right of abode in the UK, btw. But some of the others can have that entitlement added, depending on where you were born, when you were born and to whom.
[00:25:49] <CuriosTiger> My ex-mother-in-law was born a British citizen, but lost that citizenship when Jamaica gained their independence.

[01:00:56] <CuriosTiger> but it differs in each situation. She has family members who were living in the UK, those family members retained British citizenship
[01:01:23] <CuriosTiger> In some cases, such as with the breakup of Yugoslavia, people were in some cases allowed to choose based on family ties and current residency.
[01:01:52] <CuriosTiger> TimMc: I had to do a fair amount of research about citizenship rules when I acquired a second citizenship, and in spite of myself, I got a bit fascinated with the topic.
[01:01:57] <LjL> there is a status of British National that is distinct from British Citizen (may or may not have any relevance here)

[02:41:19] <Tirili> xau, your can write into the pad
[02:41:58] <xau> It should be "the 1.5%".  This is his error, not your mistake.
[02:42:25] <xau> I'm not going to edit it live, as I am not ideologically aligned with riseup, however I am still happy to help you personally.
[02:42:53] <xau> The question mark phrase: I think he's saying "leading governments", but I'm not sure
[02:43:03] <xau> It's definitely: "blot on the landscape"
[02:43:15] <Tirili> I don't even know what riseup is.
[02:43:39] <xau> It should be: "holding leaders accountable"
[02:44:00] <xau> and "demand that renewable energies be introduced NOW".  Again, this one is his error.

[02:45:52] <xau> I respect it, and do not speak or act against it.  I'm just not aligned with it.
[02:46:09] <xau> For example, I own Oil company shares.  
[02:46:51] <xau> As does every person who lives in North America or Europe or Australia or Japan, as the governments of those countries invest in Oil companies to finance their State welfare and pension plans!
[02:47:29] <xau> But that's politics!  Very off topic here.

[13:17:38] <amigojapan> I think this person may have been thinking of the North American reading of ravioli as raviowli. But I read both words as lawli and raviawli
[13:17:39] <huf> unless you mean that they both end in i
[13:18:06] <huf> i dont think loli is pronounced the same as lolly
[13:18:06] <amigojapan> At least they do both end in li
[13:18:12] <huf> and even then
[13:18:29] <amigojapan> So the final syllable is the same

[13:20:11] <huf> yeah fair enough
[13:20:22] <amigojapan> Ok
[13:20:22] <huf> still not the same sort of vowel as ravioli i think
[13:20:42] <BrainchildHo[m]> Sounds kinda off to me. Loli would rhyme with something like "rolypoly" imho

[13:20:47] <hiya> Is it correct?
