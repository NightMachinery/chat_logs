[00:00:31] <yanmaani> the US dollar is not directly governed by proof of stake, for one
[00:00:44] <yanmaani> but also, because the US dollar does not even need a consensus mechanism, because it has a government
[00:01:06] <yanmaani> also also, the US dollar has been the world reserve currency for like 100+ years, I'd say it's doing all right

[23:39:16] <bugs_> and   export BDB_CFLAGS="-I${BDB_PREFIX}/include"
[23:39:19] <bugs_> before trying make
[23:39:43] <bugs_> you also might have to define LDFLAGS to point at the library too
[23:39:54] <bugs_> so that the linker will find the library
[23:41:06] <Nicolas211> Ah, i figured configure would just prepare everything, in all tutorials and documentation make is always clean without any additional parameters
[23:41:41] <bugs_> sometimes sometimes not
[23:41:43] <bugs_> usually not
[23:43:33] <bugs_> also it is a mystery why it would be looking at /wallet for an include
[23:43:35] *** Quits: bomb-on (~bomb-on@194.144.47.113) (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[23:43:59] <bugs_> so you may have some other environment variables defined
[23:45:48] *** Joins: bomb-on (~bomb-on@194.144.47.113)
[23:45:58] <Nicolas211> I guess, not sure what to do now
[23:46:32] <bugs_> i would do those two exports and then make  see what error you get
[23:46:56] <bugs_> if you still get an error on /wallet/bdb4.h then you should type
[23:47:11] <bugs_> "env" command and examine all of your environment variables and see what
[23:47:20] <bugs_> has set something to -I /wallet
[23:47:41] <Nicolas211> so after configure is done, i run above two export commands?
[23:47:47] <bugs_> yep
[23:48:03] <bugs_> but you will have to have already checked to see if the first variable
[23:48:05] <bugs_> is set
[23:48:15] <bugs_> env | grep BDB_PREFIX
[23:48:21] <bugs_> make sure that one exists
[23:48:26] <Nicolas211> Ok, ill try it
[23:48:37] <bugs_> if it doesn't you have to define that one first
[23:49:55] <Nicolas211> trying it now
[23:50:19] <bugs_> remember without LDFLAGS set you'll probably get an error at link time if it gets that far
[23:52:01] *** Joins: Belxjander (~Belxjande@p1575007-ipoe.ipoe.ocn.ne.jp)
[23:54:06] <Nicolas211> after configure BDB_PREFIX is still shown by env, but DBV_LIBS BDB_CFLAGS etc are not
[23:54:57] <bugs_> yep so when the C++ compiler is run it won't know where to look
[23:55:39] <Nicolas211> ok i set them, ill try make now
[23:56:04] <bugs_> if the C++ compiler finishes ok it will run the linker (ld) and it won't
[23:56:15] <bugs_> know where to look for the library so you may need
[23:56:20] <bugs_> export LDFLAGS="-L${BDB_PREFIX}/lib -ldb_cxx-4.8"
[23:56:47] *** Quits: WishBoy (~WishBoy@user/wishboy) ()
[23:58:17] *** Quits: deafboy (quasselcor@cicolina.org) (Quit: deafboy)
[23:58:47] <Nicolas211> i have set export BDB_LIBS="-L${BDB_PREFIX}/lib -ldb_cxx-4.8"  and    export BDB_CFLAGS="-I${BDB_PREFIX}/include"  and then run make, i did not add     export LDFLAGS="-L${BDB_PREFIX}/lib -ldb_cxx-4.8"
[23:59:02] <bugs_> yeah if make runs ok you may not need it
[23:59:16] <Nicolas211> lets see
[23:59:17] <bugs_> if it fails at the end with a link error then you can define that
[23:59:22] <bugs_> and do make again
