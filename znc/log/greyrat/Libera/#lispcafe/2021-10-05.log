[01:55:41] <selwyn> i would use arithmetic mod 3

[02:08:53] <White_Flame> I know, but just reduced it down
[02:08:57] <White_Flame> for it's own sake
[02:14:11] <selwyn> nice solution
[02:15:56] <gilberth> Wikipedia says a sextuple is also called a hexad, so I might go with hexadecad. Also: 10-tuple = decad(e).
[02:16:05] <selwyn> a hexad
[02:16:15] <selwyn> lol
[02:16:15] <gilberth> That would be just 6 again.

[02:19:21] <Arcsech> And the efficiency gains of centralized services make it difficult (not impossible) for federated services to compete. And on top of that, it's even difficult to prevent a federated system from ending up as one or two enormous instances and a bunch of tiny ones, which isn't that far off of centralization anyway
[02:20:07] <pjb> Yes.
[02:20:26] <pjb> entropy doesn't prevent concentration, on the contrary.

[02:25:40] <gilberth> pjb: I don't believe so. A sextuple is a hexad. Also there is no sextode but an hexode. And it is "hexadecimal" while we don't say "sexadecimal". But the latter is a weak argument.
[02:27:49] *** Joins: ec (~ec@gateway/tor-sasl/ec)
[02:28:11] <pjb> gilberth: hexadecimal is a barbarism, since it' mixes a greek prefix with a roman word!  The correct form is sexadecimal (roman prefix with a roman word).
[02:28:33] <pjb> We should say sexadecimal, if we weren't so decadent.
[02:28:51] <selwyn> i like the mixing
[02:31:28] <X-Scale> pjb: speaking of decadence, it's sad how p2p got so much interest and applications 20 years ago and nowadays we're stuck into a centralization nightmare where a few big global corps totally run and control our data and lives

[02:34:04] <pjb> X-Scale: as I said, programmers didn't make it easy enough to end-users to setup and run their own servers.  Also, unfortunately, IPv4 limited 32-bit addressing and poor security didn't help promote running one's own servers…

[02:41:32] <gilberth> It however is funny that Chaos packets carry information whether the payload is 16-bit words or 8-bit bytes. The rationale is that the NCP could swap words for the host.

[10:38:20] *** gilberth is now known as {gilberth}
[10:38:56] <shka> i need memoization, i think that simply using :test equal with list compromised of function object in the first cell and the arguments in the subsequent ones  as a key will be sufficient

[10:44:10] <shka> i will use symbols instead of functions, compromise between simplicity and correctness
[10:46:04] <gilberth> Like (defmemo foo (x) (compute-foo x)) => (let ((memo (make-hash-table :test #'equal))) (defun foo (&rest args) (multiple-value-bind (values foundp) (gethash args memo) (values-list (if foundp values (setf (gethash args memo) (multiple-value-list (apply (lambda (x) (compute-foo x)) args)))))))
[10:46:37] <shka> gilberth: yeah, fare-memoization is like that
[10:47:24] <shka> i will simply use that
[10:49:51] <gilberth> Ah, so you wanted to have one hash table for multiple functions? Perhaps dynamically bound?
[10:50:18] <shka> gilberth: exactly
[10:50:52] <shka> but i think that this is how fare's lib work anyway
[10:50:56] <shka> so i will simply use it
[10:51:00] <gilberth> Then either have a global memo and have defmemo use that or add an option to defmemo to name the memo.
[10:51:50] <shka> fare is doing the second thing so it is fine

[11:12:42] <gilberth> Anyhow this FILE.c just cannot work. It talks to a server.c which implements the NCP so to speak. Which is fine, but that NCP doesn't implement flow control at all. I should figure out where this FILE.c is coming from. I believe FILE.c is ok, but the NCP is not. My plan is to re-implement that NCP in CL. It won't be portable of course, because I need all kinds of UNIXisms.
[11:13:13] <gilberth> I believe it is quicker this way instead of doing in C.
[11:13:18] <Duuqnd> UNIXisms are the worst
[11:13:43] <gilberth> It's not too bad actually. What I need is non-blocking I/O and select(2).

[11:14:40] <gilberth> That NCP is getting data from server processes and from the network and must route that streams while implementing flow control. It may never actually block on sendto(2) or recvfrom(2). Never.
[11:17:07] <gilberth> Flow control must be implemented in only sending ACKs to the packets actually passed between the network and the server process. And it ought to respect the window size that Chaosnet hosts suggest.
[11:17:25] <moon-child> non-blocking i/o?  As in aio_*?
[11:18:55] <gilberth> As in fcntl (... O_NONBLOCK ...)
[11:19:09] <gilberth> And select(2).
[11:19:37] <moon-child> well, that is not so bad
[11:20:18] <gilberth> The NCP won't deal with files, for which select(2) does not, but only with sockets or pipes, for it does.
[11:20:33] <gilberth> * does not work
[11:22:14] <gilberth> This will however entail bookkeeping. Data waiting to written, timeouts for resending when an ACK is missing, etc. Fun.
[11:25:40] <gilberth> The Chaosnet AIM however leaves questions. But I could always look at the CADR sources.

[11:47:51] <gilberth> hayley: ?
[11:48:10] <hayley> Currently only ALL-STRING-MATCHES has the compiler macro, so FIRST-MATCH does a full lookup, but I intend to expose some sort of opaque compiled code object with a function and scratch buffer for results.
[11:48:32] <hayley> Then the client only has to do one lookup, and keeps reusing that object.

[12:52:25] <gilberth> selwyn: One hyped local Corona app for contact tracing had a little bug. The health department would import CSV files from the database and (1) the app passes whatever you enter as your address say verbatim to the CSV file (2) Excel would execute macros from CSV files, when a field begins with "=" IIRC. => You could inject malware to the computers the health department uses.
[12:52:55] <selwyn> damn
[12:53:36] <gilberth> selwyn: The fix was not to properly quote fields in the CSV, but to catch problematic characters while entered in the app. So this fix is at the very wrong end.
[12:53:40] *** Joins: random-nick (~random-ni@87.116.183.117)
[12:55:14] <selwyn> i guess you need macros enabled at the other end?
[12:56:37] <gilberth> This was the poor argument of the app vendor. In practice Windows users, and some poor clerks at a state department will click on any [OK] button that pops up. And: I would as a user expect that it is ok, since the CSV comes from a trusted source.
[12:56:57] <hayley> I think Excel expressions are reasonably well sandboxed. You need to enable macros explicitly.
[12:58:37] <gilberth> hayley: They import a CSV file from a trusted source. And actually I am surprised that Excel executes macros in a CSV file. And, again, the problem is that the application didn't properly escape those things in the CSV.
[13:00:08] <selwyn> well, its all the same once its imported right
[13:00:18] <gilberth> So what would you do? As a user? You're told that you could download a CSV of Corona contacts for quarantine and alerting those contact from the back office part of that app, from a trusted vendor the government partners with. And Excels says "File contains macros. Open it? [No] [Yes] [Maybe]"?
[13:00:22] <hayley> Macros in Excel are Visual Basic programs, not the =SUM(A1:B10) stuff.
[13:00:26] * selwyn understands excel
[13:00:56] <selwyn> gilberth is right imo
[13:01:20] <hayley> I don't even think you can embed macros in cells, just the expressions. And those are "sandboxed" enough that it'll do dumb things, but not an exploit per se.
[13:01:43] <gilberth> hayley: The exploit was that in those formulas you could have what is $(somecommand ..) in bash.
[13:06:54] <semz> > I am surprised that Excel executes macros in a CSV file
[13:07:01] <semz> imo this is the real bug, but good luck getting that one fixed
[13:09:20] <pl> well, those aren't macros from excel pov
[13:10:22] * hayley is editing wikipedia
[13:10:56] <gilberth> First result with Google: https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/178724/external-command-execution-in-excel-formulas
[13:11:04] <hayley> Is "A peer-reviewed paper from 2005 came to the conclusion that GC needs five times the memory to compensate for this overhead and to perform as fast as the same program using ideal explicit memory management annotations on the same programs, which were inferred by collecting traces from programs run under a profiler." a reasonable reading of the Berger & Hertz paper?
[13:11:25] <gilberth> And yes, that are no macros but formulas. Still code injection via CSV.
[13:12:57] <hayley> Else IMO people read it to think that their own shitty code is being compared, whereas they really made the best case for malloc/free by using program traces to insert malloc/free points.
[13:15:49] <gilberth> Traces?
[13:16:17] <gilberth> What if the program doesn't follow that trace next time?
[13:16:28] <hayley> Their benchmarks are fully deterministic.
[13:16:52] <hayley> It's obviously unrealistic when you say it that way, hence why I mention it.
[13:17:47] <gilberth> So it only does work when the program does exactly the same as when the trace was taken?
[13:17:54] <hayley> Yes.
[13:18:07] <gilberth> And that is useful?
[13:18:16] <hayley> It's not a real memory management strategy, it was only used for benchmarking what "explicit memory mangement" would do for Java.
[13:18:59] <selwyn> that sounds like a strange paper
[13:19:02] <hayley> And I don't know who wanted such an answer really. You have one memory manager with all the information it'd ever need, and one with none. Guess which one performs better.
[13:19:34] <hayley> Yes, but it was peer reviewed and a lot of people cite it for GC performance metrics, which is dumb.
[13:20:09] <hayley> "Really, the conclusion should be "the ideal memory manager with perfect knowledge of program execution would match the same performance of a memory manager with very little knowledge about the program with a sixth of the memory". And then the response would be "sure, but why the hell is that an interesting statistic?" Of course, it's not interesting at all." - me, https://applied-langua.ge/posts/quantifying-nothing-at-all.html
[13:20:53] <gilberth> hayley: Nothing changed. I am a bit tired of this industry-wide irrational fear of GC. It's a never ending story.
[13:21:27] <selwyn> compsci sucks lol
[13:21:55] <Gnuxie> it's really irrational 
[13:21:57] <selwyn> how can it be a healthy culture where people cite stuff like that
[13:21:58] <gilberth> I rather fear manual memory management and weak typing and buffer overflows and integer overflows.
[13:22:06] <Gnuxie> can't comprehend the stupidity tbh but whatever 
[13:22:22] <pl> hayley: ehh, I see it as kind of establishing possible "best impossible case baseline"
[13:22:37] <Gnuxie> but it's not possible 
[13:22:38] <hayley> pl: Yes, it's useful for _that_, but nothing more.
[13:23:32] <selwyn> hm
[13:23:33] <gilberth> Well, I can see skipping overflow and bound checks on the slow hardware that there was some fourty years ago. Those machines were really slow for todays standard. But in 2021? You're kidding?
[13:23:50] <selwyn> do their conclusions carry over into the non-deterministic case though
[13:23:58] <selwyn> if not, then it is not a convincing baseline
[13:24:15] <selwyn> oh
[13:24:54] <shka> i think that there are only two concerns when using GCs
[13:25:02] <gilberth> [For example: Just reading plain.tex took some ten minutes or more, so Knuth went with overflow checking off, once he believed the was debugged.]
[13:25:04] <hayley> They don't. You have to make a trace to make their ideal situation.
[13:25:05] <shka> latency and the memory consumption
[13:26:29] <gilberth> hayley: Yes, and depending on this trace makes it useless. It might serve as a lower bound for overhead on one single particular input. This is of theoretical value, but of no practical value.
[13:27:04] <hayley> Also c.f https://laptrinhx.com/on-quantifying-the-performance-of-garbage-collection-vs-explicit-memory-management-3093703079/
[13:27:17] <hayley> "Remember: the oracle precomputes the optimal place to free every heap allocated block of memory. Is it reasonable to assume that human software developers will do the same? Absolutely not."
[13:27:31] <Gnuxie> lwel
[13:28:33] <gilberth> I have better things to do with my little time than to reason about memory mangement. We have computers to save us effort, not to cause extra unneeded.

[13:31:25] <moon-child> Maybe prefer just 'the overhead of [...] can lead...'

[13:33:35] <gilberth> Anyhow the older I get and the less time I have, the more I don't care and just use CL. It would be still a good language, even when I would be the last one using it.

[13:42:04] <selwyn> what lol
[13:42:16] <hayley> Yes.
[13:44:20] <gilberth> Well, it's all a question of terms. With a pointer bumping allocator, is newspace a "heap" or a "stack"?
[13:44:49] <hayley> Quoth the Handbook: "Azul find that they still need occasional thread-local collections to deal with dead stack allocated objects in long lived frames."
[13:45:18] <gilberth> Could be seen like you just pile up your conses, hence a stack. :)
[13:45:46] <hayley> The reason to have stack allocation was so that the allocation pointer would remain relatively stable, as opposed to a copying collector which sweeps linearly through some region; thus the cache would behave better,
[13:45:48] <gilberth> hayley: Heh. That is actually funny.

[22:58:49] <gilberth> And this won't change. Not with the new parliament.
[22:59:37] <gilberth> Also, it's highly unlikely that we get a speed limit.
[23:02:44] <gilberth> What shall I do, when I have seen packet number n and packet number _n_+2 arrives? Stash it for a time? But it would be very likely that packet _n_+1 got lost, and I can't ask for only _n_+1 being resent. So perhaps I just drop _n_+2. Hmm.
[23:03:45] <selwyn> hm
[23:04:01] <gilberth> ACKs are funny, as there are two sequence numbers being ACKed. The last packet processed by the server and the last packet received.
[23:05:11] <gilberth> selwyn: In my setup packets will be in order and never lost. But packets could be lost with a real network and I have no clue, if one packet could overrun another. Perhaps it can in theory.
[23:05:40] <selwyn> are the packets lost independently with equal probability?
[23:06:15] <gilberth> In a real network? Good question.
[23:06:34] <selwyn> i am too dumb to understand networks
[23:06:47] <selwyn> well
[23:07:44] <gilberth> I'd say, when a network is busy, perhaps so. It would be rolling dice whether my packet makes it though because of congestion at some router down the route to the destination. But Chaosnet is not designed for a WAN.
[23:08:25] <gilberth> selwyn: The sad part is: I was taught all this at uni. Long ago.

[23:13:25] <gilberth> Interesting? No. Tedious, I'd say.
[23:13:28] <selwyn> oh
[23:13:50] *** Quits: childlikempress (~moon-chil@cardinal.elronnd.net) (Quit: !)
[23:15:17] <gilberth> This flow control is tricky, as it basically works by the server noticing that ACKs are missing and it would adjust it's speed to match the one of the reciever. This is kind of measured. You notice that with TCP/IP as it implements slow start. Ever watched a big download gaining speed the first few seconds?
[23:15:46] <gilberth> The sender would increase his pace until ACKs are missed and then throttle again.
[23:16:54] <gilberth> The server could have a 1Gbps link, say. But the receiver might be in Germany on a 0.384Mbps land line. The server could not know beforehand.
[23:17:14] *** Joins: moon-child (~moon-chil@cardinal.elronnd.net)
[23:19:20] <gilberth> So the current behaviour of the CADR simulator to not toss incoming packets, when the simulated CPU is not processing the packets fast enough is not helpful at all. It must toss packets, so that the sender could throttle.
[23:19:55] <selwyn> damn thats why downloads start fast
[23:20:26] <gilberth> Depends, this can be tuned for TCP/IP.
[23:21:22] <gilberth> But also: When in between there is congestion and the download gets slower, and the congestion goes away, it need some time to gain speed again.
[23:22:17] <gilberth> When a link is full and cannot pass incoming packets down the other link, those packets are just tossed. This is how it works.
[23:24:04] <gilberth> Anyhow, this Chaosnet protocol is trivial compared to TCP/IP, so I really contemplate to implement that for my yet to be build TTL CPU.

[23:37:31] <gilberth> Seems like I need to use UNIX syscalls directly. Begins with that READ-SEQUENCE would wait until all the buffer is read, which I don't want, I want to return with just any data that is there. As I don't know beforehand how much is available.
[23:38:29] <gilberth> I always miss that. I should propose some :SHORT keyword argument to READ-SEQUENCE and WRITE-SEQUENCE. :TIMEOUT would be handy, too.
[23:40:06] <gilberth> And for O_NONBLOCK, the WRITE-SEQUENCE should just return "zero elements written." A broken pipe could be a condition and it would be nice when that condition is specified.
[23:41:32] <gilberth> Or :TIMEOUT 0 would just trigger that behavior? Hmm.
[23:43:41] <gilberth> But there is a subtle difference in behavior for O_NONBLOCK set or not. A write(2) with O_NONBLOCK off could still block when select(2) says the fd is fit for output.
[23:52:41] <pjb> gilberth: I'd vote for chaosnet/internet gateways, so people could access stuff servers in your chaosnet.
