[01:51:03] <geekosaur> so as to your earlier comment about the Z ring, the standard Haskell numeric typeclasses don't really capture the notion of rings. there are alternative typeclasses that do
[01:51:27] <EvanR> Num isn't the same as a ring just because haskell likes to take laws seriously, which would make Double for instance not Nummable
[01:51:32] <geekosaur> although those have their own problems because Int, for example, doesn't fit them well because it's secretly a quotient type

[02:54:34] <Lycurgus> there's a lot of free stuff from haskell but generally you have no idea how it actually at the lowest level works
[02:55:25] <Lycurgus> relatively speaking, it's a faith

[07:08:17] <dsal> Oh, well, fromInteger is partial.  I didn't expect that.
[07:11:04] <awpr> there's not really a good Num instance for the finite sets.  modular arithmetic is okay enough, but in the not-uncommon case where people do arithmetic assuming it won't be out-of-range, having it silently wrap can hide bugs, and it's extra unintuitive for `fromInteger`
[07:12:00] <awpr> do you want Num for anything other than supporting integral literals?
[07:13:05] <dsal> Heh, not *really*.  Maybe some addition or something.
[07:13:12] <dsal> I'm representing relative time as the number of minutes since midnight.
[07:13:28] <dsal> Yeah, addition might be nice, and them modulo is the right thing to do.
[07:13:56] <awpr> hmm, maybe.  seems like you'd want modular addition with an overflow flag
[07:14:14] <awpr> like you'd have in adding digits of a positional number system
[07:14:29] <dsal> This is the kind of thing that's not likely to be used incorrectly, but I decided not to make it super difficult to use for the normal case where someone wants to just stick a number in a piece of code.
[07:16:14] <awpr> yeah, my thinking is that literals should be separate from the other parts of `Num`, and along with some extra features for validating literal values, that's `dependent-literals-plugin`
[07:16:30] <awpr> it was actually created specifically to deal with the problem of literals for `Fin`s

[17:22:22] <timCF> Hello! Are there any runtime perfornamce issues because using TypeApplications `@a` syntax instead of `Proxy :: Proxy a` in generic functions with `forall a.`? For me `@a` looks better, and I'll use it any day of the week instead of Proxy, but is it coming for free in terms of performance?
[17:22:48] <merijn> timCF: Performance: Probably. Maintenance: No
[17:22:56] <dminuoso> TypeApplication could probably be cheaper since there's no token that GHC must optimize away
[17:23:08] <dminuoso> But I call premature optimization
[17:24:02] <timCF> You mean TypeApplications might be even better in terms of performance?

[17:24:06] *** Joins: FinnElija (~finn_elij@user/finn-elija/x-0085643)
[17:24:25] <merijn> TypeApplications may also break randomly when your dependencies *OR* compiler update, so...
[17:24:26] <dminuoso> timCF: Personally I prefer Proxy in most situations because a) it guarantees stable and communicatable API, b) doesn't demand yet-another extension from a user, and it's often easier to pass things around by binding a proxy pattern rather than introduce some forall at some outer level
[17:25:19] <merijn> TypeApplications is great, if you like things like "accidentall tying the stability of my API to implementation details of your specific compiler version"!
[17:25:20] <dminuoso> If both sides (the definition and call site) are under your full control, it probably doesn't matter
[17:25:34] <dminuoso> But be sure to introduce all variables explicitly via forall
[17:26:52] <timCF> merijn: dminuoso: thanks! 
[17:27:23] <timCF> merijn: you mean it might brake when I'm using some dependency, and then they switch order in forall expression for some reason?
[17:27:38] <dminuoso> Also, TypeApplications tends to be a bit brittle when since you cant apply polymorphic things to visible type arguments after inference has done its job
[17:27:48] <merijn> timCF: Yes. And also if they never used an explicit forall and the GHC infers a different order for implicit foralls
[17:27:49] <dminuoso> e.g.:
[17:27:52] <dminuoso> % f = id
[17:27:52] <yahb> dminuoso: 
[17:27:54] <dminuoso> % :t f
[17:27:55] <yahb> dminuoso: a -> a
[17:28:04] <dminuoso> % :t f @Int
[17:28:04] <yahb> dminuoso: ; <interactive>:1:1: error:; * Cannot apply expression of type `a0 -> a0'; to a visible type argument `Int'; * In the expression: f @Int
[17:28:06] <merijn> timCF: Which is not a hypothetical situation, because we've already had 1 GHC release that broke TypeApplications that way
[17:28:19] <merijn> (changed the order constraints were inferred in)
[17:28:22] <dminuoso> timCF: ^- Do instantly and intuitively know why this is?
[17:29:12] <timCF> dminuoso: AllowAmbiguousTypes or something like this?
[17:29:16] <dminuoso> Nope.
[17:29:31] <merijn> Is it...the monomorphism restriction? :D
[17:29:38] <dminuoso> Nope
[17:29:42] <merijn> aww
[17:29:43] <kuribas> merijn: solution: always use explicit forall.
[17:30:04] <dminuoso> timCF: You cant apply things with "invisible" type variables to visible type arguments.
[17:30:14] <dminuoso> There's subtle reasons for why all that is
[17:30:40] <dminuoso> But the consequence is that you cant use TypeApplications as freely because as soon as GHC does type inference, you cant use TypeApplications anymore
[17:30:51] <dminuoso> That is, if GHC repolymorphizes
[17:30:54] <merijn> kuribas: Do your dependencies do that, though?
[17:31:12] <dminuoso> timCF: Proxy is really much more solid and obvious. :)
[17:31:20] <timCF> merijn: who knows really :)
[17:31:22] <dminuoso> Albeit a bit noisy, but other than that it has mostly just benefits
[17:31:31] <merijn> kuribas: Also, I don't, because I dislike TypeApplications for reasons above
[17:31:32] <kuribas> merijn: I don't use TypeApplications if they don't.
[17:31:50] <dminuoso> timCF: Though you can do one interesting combination
[17:31:52] <dminuoso> That one I favor
[17:31:56] <dminuoso> Proxy *with* TypeApplications
[17:32:03] <kuribas> Just use a language where you can apply types as arguments.
[17:32:04] <dminuoso> f (Proxy @Int)
[17:32:12] <dminuoso> This is a nice middle ground
[17:32:16] <timCF> dminuoso: that's actually cool
[17:32:59] <timCF> kuribas: for example?

[17:33:10] <timCF> hmmm

[17:59:21] <Franciman> when you can choose optimal evaluation
[17:59:25] <maerwald> the final value was forced, but there was a huge intermediate thunk buildup, which caused immense performance regression in a hot loop... forcing the final value doesn't help you at all
[18:00:06] <maerwald> so we had to go through the entire codebase and identify the issues... most of them were in data constructors

[18:07:25] <Franciman> ok

[18:15:24] <Franciman> imho laziness is the best default when you are coding on paper and don't expect your code to run anywhere
[18:15:40] <Franciman> otherwise you also need to, some extent, understand the computational model of the machine
[18:15:58] <Franciman> hence, if you are so fond of retaining laziness, you need a way to understand how the code runs

[18:18:52] <Franciman> we are doomed
[18:18:56] <Franciman> you can't reason about anything

[19:54:25] <sclv> i don't find strict data helps much with thunk leaks -- that's about writing code carefully. i do find it helps when pared with unpacking for controlling memory usage in certain specialized situations
[19:54:36] <merijn> Maybe legal will agree if they get annoyed too much

[20:02:25] <maralorn> I can contribute that I have been bitten by thinking StrictData works that way. I have a huge record, which really should be strict. But most fields are Maybes and Sets and when I disabled StrictData I wasn‘t knowledgable enough to realize how little this helps me.

[21:26:58] <int-e> nf: Yes you need to trust lens to allow that. Is it safe? I don't know. Last I checked it looked like the worst thing it does is open access to `coerce`. But its huge and it's easy to miss something.
[21:28:39] <dsal> lens is bad because you can magnify things and start fires.
[21:28:43] <int-e> (Data.Coerce is unsafe... and indeed it was initially riddled with various type checking problems that allowed people to write `unsafeCoerce`. But I think they've been addressed.

[21:41:52] <int-e> nf: well it alrady told you that Control.Lens isn't safe. Since Control.Lens isn't marked as Trustworthy, that is an inferred property. So you can import the modules it depends on to narrow things down.
[21:42:17] <nf> i see
[21:42:27] <int-e> It's no fun... there's no tooling (beyond ghci) around SafeHaskell as far as I know.
[21:42:45] <nf> disclaimer i have no idea what Trustworthy or even Safe mean
[21:43:37] <int-e> "Trustworthy" is how you override the inferred unsafety of a module: if the user trusts the package that contains a Trustworthy module, then that module can be imported from Safe modules.
[21:44:37] <int-e> So... "inferred safe" basically means that all imports are Safe or trusted and Trustworthy.
