[03:44:23] <PaulWay[w]> I get a good decaffeinated ground coffee from Jindebah in Canberra.
[03:44:49] <PaulWay[w]> The headaches are mostly dehydration - coffee mildly suppresses the feeling of thirst.
[03:45:17] <Fish-Face> I know, but I trained myself to drink more water, especially at the first sign of a headache, but it doesn't help
[03:45:20] <tm007> Is coffee bad long term?
[03:45:20] <PaulWay[w]> Theoretically there's enough water in a standard coffee to offset that, but I suspect people drinking double espressos don't get that benefit.
[03:45:30] <Fish-Face> so I think it's also just the caffeine
[03:45:39] <tm007> could be the sugar?
[03:45:42] <Fish-Face> caffeine withdrawal directly causes headaches, right? without dehydration

[03:54:34] <tm007> Good morning GinFuyou
[03:54:47] <Fish-Face> OK. So I think the method of using `prefetch_related` is not going to work for me because it's too limited. Instead what I will likely want to do is run the query myself and do the join in python myself - just as prefetch_related does behind the scenes, but with more control. I'd like to do this in a custom queryset class used for the object, wtih a method which causes all instances in the queryset to gain the required information. Collecting and storing
[03:54:47] <Fish-Face> the information in the queryset is easy enough, but how do I get it onto the instances when the queryset is evaluated?
[03:55:35] <PaulWay[w]> I've used that technique too.  I suppose I should have remembered it when you asked.
[03:55:40] <PaulWay[w]> Are you using DRF?
[03:55:44] <Fish-Face> nope
[03:55:49] <tm007> Fish-Face: what's the limitation?
[03:56:05] <PaulWay[w]> OK.  How are you compiling the structure of data?
[03:56:38] <tm007> You can use the Prefetch object to further control the prefetch operation
[03:56:44] <Fish-Face> tm007: so if I were using a Prefetch object, I'd want to set the queryset to something which filters based on a field from the "root" object
[03:56:56] <Fish-Face> in addition to the field implicitly used when prefetching
[03:57:21] <onorbumbum> Hello everybody! Hope everyone is doing well. I am working on a project and using ionic for simple frontend. I am having trouble using the input elements the framework provides. https://ionicframework.com/docs/api/input My question: how does one make django spit out <ion-input> instead of <input> while still using template tags like {{form.field}}
[03:57:41] <onorbumbum> Thank you in advance.
[03:58:23] <Fish-Face> PaulWay[w]: so each instance in the starting qs just needs to get a list (or any iterable really) of the related instances. I'll query that table directly and assemble a dict of model_a ids: [model_b instances]
[03:59:44] <PaulWay[w]> Right.  And how are you presenting this?
[04:00:19] <Fish-Face> to a user? potentially not at all; it will be used in further calculations in multiple ways
[04:00:27] <PaulWay[w]> onorbumbum: sounds like you'll need to generate the template entirely manually.
[04:00:45] <PaulWay[w]> Fish-Face: sounds like there's a lot going on in there.  Can it be broken down into simpler steps?
[04:01:05] <onorbumbum> @PaulWay that was what I was afraid of ending up having to do. Thank you
[04:01:08] <Fish-Face> the end-user presentation and these subsequent calculations can be forgotten about
[04:01:51] <Fish-Face> I think the "assigning a collection of things to an instance upon queryset evaluation" is the smallest unknown step I can identify :)
[04:03:29] <PaulWay[w]> onorbumbum: you might have some luck probing the internals of Django to see how it builds forms.  But I suspect not.

[04:33:05] <Fish-Face> PaulWay[w]: the only way I can see is to override the (private!) _fetch_all method on the queryset and whack the data onto the instances once they're created
[04:40:53] <onorbumbum> thank you @tm007 I will try to figure it out there
[04:41:20] <tm007> Feel free to message here if you get stuck
[04:42:15] <onorbumbum> @tm007 this tutorial seems like it's manually rendering the form.
[04:42:29] <tm007> oh no
[04:42:38] <tm007> that's not what you want i suppose
[04:43:10] <onorbumbum> worst case scenario I'll end up doing that, but I enjoyed the convenience of {{form.field}} template tag
[04:56:52] <Fish-Face> Hmm. Overriding _fetch_all works but I'm seeing some weird behaviour: it looks like many queryset methods return copies of the instance they're called on, rather than modifying and returning self. That means that when I set a flag to say "add this info when the instances are fetched" it tends to get lost, because it's not one of the flags which django copies to the new qs :/

[05:19:27] <rtpg> For the longest time I've had CSRF issues which I _thought_ were related to session CSRF rerolls (like someone logs out, logs back in, older page still working). But our users are still hitting pretty random "CSRF invalid" issues from time to time (with people using Edge seeming to hit it more? but that might just be because of our user distribution). Is there some sort of known browser thing that would cause CSRF issues like this?

[05:21:23] <rtpg> main theory was that somewhere in our middleware before the CSRF thing we end up calling the template rendering (but only in some cases), and that would "mess stuff up" cuz the CSRF middleware seems to assume being called before template renders. Just curious if others have seen anything even vaguely similar

[06:43:08] <rtpg> oh... we are using secure-only cookies but I'm not sure if it's related. The main manifestation is that users seem to just have mismatching CSRF tokens between cookies and the POST data (and I feel like if a secure-only cookie related issue were there it would be more like "the cookie is missing entirely"-variety)

[08:35:27] <PaulWay[w]> Well, turned out I had an anti-pattern in my code.
[08:35:42] <PaulWay[w]> A module-level variable that was taking its value from the settings.
[08:35:54] <PaulWay[w]> E.g. RBAC_URL = settings.RBAC_URL.

[16:16:34] <jor> wallbroken: sure, usually you can just change the field's widget to a CheckboxSelectMultiple
[16:16:44] <wez> wallbroken: It is possible if you code it.
[16:17:08] <wez> wallbroken: jor's answer is more helpful though :)
[16:17:34] <wallbroken> well, actually i need to select the row of the current user from the m2m list and then click on "submit"
[16:17:36] <wez> I haven't used Django admin or templates in over 4 yrs
[16:18:21] <wallbroken> what i want is that when i set the checkbox, it automatically selects that current user from m2m, and then i need to click on "submit"
[16:21:41] <jor> not sure I understand completely, but that sounds pretty custom, have to implementa that logic yourself
[16:21:45] <jor> Add a new (boolean) field to your ModelForm and pick up its value in the save call and set the m2m
[16:25:12] <wallbroken> https://www.dropbox.com/s/mxwu9ixlg7emqlg/Untitled.png?dl=0
[16:25:18] <wallbroken> this is how it actually is
[16:25:21] <wallbroken> and it's not good
[16:25:32] <wallbroken> i want to have a checkbox instead of a list
[16:26:02] <wallbroken> and when the user flags it, the current user will be selected

[19:25:42] <giant> I have a form with a multiple select field, however the default UI/UX is not good like you could forget to press Ctrl and just remove choices without even knowing it. I successfully implemented the admin multiple select where you can move choices from left to right so there is no accident. The problem is you need to be logged in as a superuser
[19:25:42] <giant> otherwise it default to the standard one. I searched for two days and I couldn't find something clear/not outdated enough. So what I'm asking is: how can one use the admin multiple select without superuser permission or can I extract the js/css to implement it myself?
[19:27:36] <moldy> giant: i think there are a couple of third-party apps that implement better multi-select widgets for use outside of the admin

[22:31:28] <hylje> well i hope you're not facilitating an account hijack :-)

[22:32:40] <regedit> if i had an array of several hundred strings, and i wanted to filter out all those strings which exist on a certain model's database table column. any shorter way how to do that than loop several hundred database queries?
[22:32:43] <JordiGH> hylje: If I wanted to faciliate an account hijack, how would do it? I'm reading the code and can't find where the password reset url is generated.
[22:32:47] <regedit> is there any way to do it in 1 query?
[22:34:46] <JordiGH> So the obvious answer seems to be .filter(that_column__in=list_of_strings).values_list(that_column, flat=True) and now you have your list of strings to match and you can perform the rest of the filtering in Python without hitting your db. Why doesn't this work?
[22:36:33] <regedit> ah i see... 🤔 right... obviously. i guess i was hoping the query can already achieve the filtering, not needing to fetch all those strings from database and _then_ filter in python..
