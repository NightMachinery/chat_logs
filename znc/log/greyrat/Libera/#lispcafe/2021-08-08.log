[00:02:34] <ln43> ok.. it was just to ask, i was curious reading the title of that news
[00:03:08] <ln43> but again, considering the usages maybe it's a good thing to know
[00:03:10] <selwyn> it is exciting
[00:03:18] <selwyn> someone came up with a new thing to do with a quantum computer
[00:03:20] <selwyn> and did it
[00:03:32] <selwyn> doesn´t happen every day
[00:06:20] <ln43> yes true, and that is new technology that is quite fun to work with because of the novelity... so yes, i agree
[00:11:57] <ln43> anyway, changing topic i was thinking that maybe healthcare should be a good sector to switch myself too (maybe) after a discussion i had with a person that was working in that sector

[00:14:37] <ln43> but ok, there are so many different possibilities and not being totally sure (not having the necessary confidence) disincentive me to do that ...
[00:20:54] <lotuseater> damn, next thing now what this "fmaf" is :D
[00:21:23] <ln43> dams are not easy to build ... like bridges
[00:21:35] <lotuseater> hah.
[00:21:45] <lotuseater> then "jeeeeez, Rick"
[00:21:47] <ln43> yes structurally i mean...demands a lot of engineering effort 
[00:23:19] <ln43> ok but we're not civil engineers : / are they doing the dams ?
[00:23:39] <ln43> yes breaking dams is quite simple in comparison
[00:23:41] <lotuseater> beavers are masters at this
[00:24:19] <ln43> xd
[00:24:41] <ln43> who doesn't behaves doesn't live well
[00:24:45] <lotuseater> there was a funny show in the 2000s, beaver brothers xD
[00:25:30] <ln43> let me check for the meaning of that word... just a minute or more...
[00:26:31] <lotuseater> those creatures that build damns for their natural habitat
[00:26:42] <lotuseater> you can use deepl.com
[00:27:52] <ln43> right
[00:32:40] <ln43> ok but in nature there are quite fine examples of engineering 
[00:32:48] <lotuseater> oh many!
[00:33:12] <ln43> consider nests ...

[00:39:20] <ln43> yes, just as an example ...
[00:39:34] <ln43> but i feel good when i use that shell 
[00:39:44] <ln43> so there is not issue with it
[00:40:06] <ln43> or not ?
[00:42:39] <ln43> yes but that fight against systemd is not bad ... basically it behaves like an octopus ... : / 
[00:43:34] <pjb> Just /bin/init with /etc/rc is all you need.
[00:43:40] <pjb> If you're a sysadmin, of course.
[00:43:59] <pjb> If you want canned system administration then whatever the distribution packages.
[00:44:23] <pjb> In that case, be not surprised if they choose something modular line init.d or launchd^W systemd.
[00:44:34] <pjb> s/line/like/
[00:44:56] <pjb> After that, don't complain about garden fenced environments and censorship.
[00:47:15] <ln43> ok but to say i'm  fan of the bsd's init style... or something similar
[00:49:04] <ln43> or having a dedicate script to start/stop/restart any service
[00:49:29] <ln43> yes it's for clarity
[00:49:51] <ln43> having dedicate runlevels ...
[00:53:02] <ln43> no graphical login... no wm started by default and so on
[00:53:44] <ln43> just having a minimal system with few required services to build on top
[00:54:13] <ln43> yes but it depends a lot from the distro you choose
[00:54:59] *** Quits: santiagopim (~user@90.166.59.133) (Remote host closed the connection)
[00:55:03] <lotuseater> one once told me systemd services are well manageable with NixOS
[00:56:39] <pjb> ln43: that's the point. A  distribution is canned system administration. You are delegating your sysadmin job to redhat, debian or ubuntu.
[00:56:57] <pjb> ln43: if they choose to use systemd or something else, you don't get a choice.
[00:58:01] <pjb> And actually if they make it so you have a choice, it's even worse, the the various options, and the graphic layer they add for users, you just get a broken Rube Goldberg Machine.
[00:59:33] <ln43> yes right but i'm concerned for the hardware part too ... and maybe there is a lot more to consider than just the running os (thta of course is of fundamental importance but it's not the only point to consider)
[01:02:07] <ln43> ok ... really i don't want to be paranoid but if someone wants do something maybe someone knows and so there is no freedom if not doing nothing ... this is the feeling i have
[01:04:14] <ln43> anyway yes... who is selling something sells something that is not really a property of who buys it
[01:05:16] <ln43> as  happens when i buy spoons or a towel or something that is not intended to be controlled by the outside : /+
[01:07:32] <ln43> and so there are a lot of ethical issues and it's part of the spiritual path of the mans of this epoch  
[01:08:05] <ln43> in a certain sense we're all part of the all... so there is a transcendental view of that thing
[01:08:14] <gilberth> The wikipedia article about fast-inverse-square-root is hilarious, as it mentions that casting an float pointer to an int pointer and then dereferencing it is UB, but using memcpy(3) is not! And then suggests a version using a union, but says it would use more memory. sigh
[01:10:00] <ln43> are you rewriting quake 3 ?
[01:10:17] <gilberth> No, I read up about the fast inverse square.
[01:10:53] <gilberth> And btw, don't mention the allowed trap representation of a char in C.
[01:11:10] <ln43> ok, i never tried to explore how it worked but for that time it was an innovation 
[01:11:42] <ln43> and required to render in small time graphical contents even without gpus and things we have nowdays
[01:13:01] <gilberth> The real inventions, all not Carmarck's are found elsewhere.
[01:13:42] <ln43> which are those real inventions ?
[01:14:15] <gilberth> The data structures. The BSP and especially the visibilty information there in.
[01:15:03] <ln43> yes of course ds and algorithms 
[01:15:18] <gilberth> Not some coding tricks to save a cycle here and there. Wikipedia also says that fast inverse square was already around, but then I don't consider wikepedia as a reliable source.
[01:16:14] <ln43> yes you already told that ...
[01:16:21] <ln43> about wikipedia
[01:16:35] <gilberth> And that visibilty pre-computation is really hard linear algebra in 5d, IIRC.
[01:17:42] <ln43> didn't they have done a dimensionality reduction ?
[01:17:50] <gilberth> BSPs are easy to get and balancing them is just tricky.
[01:17:52] <ln43> is it possible ?
[01:18:17] <gilberth> A dimensional reduction? You mean a projection? No.
[01:19:33] <ln43> yes gilberth... i was trying weeks ago to see a little bit how a chess engine was made... but then i stopped to not hurt myself too much
[01:20:05] <ln43> even there without any graphics since you use mostly xboard as a gui is not so simple
[01:21:40] <gilberth> As Quake came out we really got into that topic and read and implemented the papers. I suggested a portal based implementation, which also worked well. Later I learned that the latter was considered for Quake, too. Portal based would have had the advantage that no pre-computation beyond CSG would have been needed.
[01:22:45] <gilberth> I don't know about chess programs in particular, but I would guess they still use alpha-beta pruning at their core.
[01:26:24] <ln43> i had to learn chess rules too just to begin
[01:27:45] <ln43> as a reference wiki i used the suggested one: https://www.chessprogramming.org/Main_Page
[01:27:46] -ixelp- Chessprogramming wiki
[01:27:53] <gilberth> Why not do draughts? Less rules to learn.
[01:28:31] <gilberth> Actually I don't like chess at all.
[01:30:06] <ln43> yes for search it was used even that one
[01:30:23] <ln43> but i don't used it ... i stopped before
[01:32:15] <ln43> i liked chess just to learn a new play
[01:32:44] <ln43> but there are a lot of rules, you know... promotions and castling just to say
[01:32:50] <ln43> so it was funny
[01:35:00] <ln43> all started by considering easy problems like if it was possible for a knight to cover the full board..,. things like that 
[01:35:44] <ln43> yes there is the eight queens problem too ... and things like that
[01:35:56] <ln43> not so much difficult, just to start
[01:38:03] *** Joins: selwyn (~selwyn@user/selwyn)
[01:40:11] <ln43> and definitely nowdays machines are a lot better to play that not humans ... with highest ELO (https://ccrl.chessdom.com/ccrl/4040/)
[01:40:29] <ln43> consider that a chess grandmaster has an elo of roughly 2700
[01:40:46] <ln43> just to give an idea
[01:41:48] <ln43> mow machines have database for openings too and are advantaged from the start
[01:45:13] <ln43> yes and then there are a lot of concepts that are applicable to chess: quadtrees , masks and so on... 
[01:45:27] <ln43> so it's a good subject to investigate

[06:31:23] * hayley wonders how to compute the p-value or something of CI being broken, rather than it just finding a bug that I thought I proved didn't exist every time.
[06:34:40] <hayley> We failed like 4/4 times on CI, and failed 0/more than 100 times on my desktop, laptop and Pi all up.
[06:35:13] <hayley> If it were random, the probability of failure would be less than 4/104 (but I'll just use that fraction as a worst-case).
[06:40:42] <hayley> The probability of seeing 4 out of 4 failures with a failure rate of 4/104 is about 2.2e-6. And the probability of seeing 0 out of 100 failures is about 0.020.
[06:58:28] <kakuhen> well, first formulate what your null hypothesis is, then ask yourself "assuming the null hypothesis is true, what is the probability of X?"
[06:58:41] <kakuhen> i can't really help here since I'm not sure what'd be a good model for your problem
[07:02:08] <hayley> Okay, the null hypothesis is something like "CI isn't broken, you are just very unlucky that all the failures happened on CI." Then we have a binomial distribution with probability for a test to succeed of 4/104, and 4 tests, and the probability that all 4 succeed is about 2.2e-6.
[07:02:58] <hayley> n.b. I assume failures to be independent as no state is carried between tests, and I tested on different machines with different loads and processors.

[08:26:19] <Aurora_v_kosmose> PhantomOS has some interesting system properties that reminded me of the LispOS stuff.

[08:27:52] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It's also no Lisp OS, although if Java works for it, then ABCL probably does.
[08:31:52] <Aurora_v_kosmose> tl;dr managed code, persistent virtual memory, single adress space, capabilities...  
[08:32:19] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Ah right, entirely optional filesystem. System is based on objects.
[08:33:11] <hayley> I'm a bit un-sold on them suggesting using process isolation to run "fast" unsafe code - the JIT should be reasonable enough that you win on other architectural decisions.
[08:33:26] * hayley goes to download an image and run it in a VM.
[08:34:27] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The core not being implemented in a particularly safe language (C) and not being verified is a bit troublesome with that.
[08:35:10] <hayley> I would assume the core is safe enough to run in the same address space. Else it wouldn't be much of a single-address-space system.
[08:35:42] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I still found it interesting that someone actually went ahead and implemented something like that.
[08:35:54] <hayley> "Even simple JIT engine will help a lot." Guess you start from somewhere still.
[08:35:56] <hayley> Indeed.

[17:51:20] * hayley has a completely evil plan for fairly Lispy packed arrays of structs.
[17:53:05] <hayley> The idea is to use a crapton of interior pointers so that you still have object identity, and so that instance updating even should still work. The overhead is that we currently steal a word per struct to pack, but IMO enough things come in threes that I wouldn't mind.
[17:53:43] <hayley> e.g. XYZ double-floats + header would fit twice per cache line, hash code + key + value is another good triple.
[17:57:49] <hayley> So, perhaps an array looks like [ element type | length | elements... ] and each element has a pointer back to the array. Then we can take interior pointers + some unique tag for AREF, and the GC and TYPEP can load the back pointer to read layout and whatnot.
[18:00:51] <hayley> You could very nearly pack even standard classes, but no subclassing would be allowed, and thus no CHANGE-CLASS either.
[18:01:18] <hayley> selwyn, phoe: any thoughts on this somewhat immodest proposal?
[18:01:47] <selwyn> i uh

[18:02:22] <selwyn> what´s xyz double-floats?
[18:03:16] <hayley> 3d coordinates?
[18:03:50] <hayley> An example of how IMO losing a word to that "header" per "instance" is slightly bearable.
[18:06:36] <selwyn> right
[18:09:41] <hayley> Honestly, it's not really but I was trying to make plain ol' reference passing and dynamic typing work acceptably.
[18:17:17] <hayley> Still Hayley 1-0 Cliff Click imo
[18:20:03] <hayley> selwyn: in case I didn't reply yesterday, I asked Cliff about callee saves registers when you have inlining and a precise tracing GC.
[18:21:19] <selwyn> oh ok cool
[18:21:34] <hayley> He thinks they are a hassle but still a win on RISC machines, provided you are careful  that inlining doesn't mess up register allocation for you. But beach thinks the SICL register allocator is better of course.
[18:24:13] <hayley> Which is strange, because I thought graph colouring was a fairly normal allocation technique that "no one got fired for", so to speak.
[18:30:39] <hayley> Apparently C# has something for interior pointers, and Go even pulls it off with olde interface{}....hmm.
[18:31:14] <hayley> I bet Go boxes some more, since otherwise stuff is supposed to be packed like C.
[18:34:11] * hayley is amused the subtitle of https://erik-engheim.medium.com/go-does-not-need-a-java-style-gc-ac99b8d26c60 says Java has an expensive GC.
[18:35:58] <hayley> And it is already wrong in the first part. The type, lock and mark bits all fit in one word IIRC. Kinda hard to not think about using the low bits when the type will be aligned.
[18:38:08] <hayley> "In a multithreaded program, a bump allocator requires locks." What kinda drugs is this guy on? Thread local allocation buffers are right *there*.
[18:41:52] <hayley> Must be fun to be a gopher.

[21:27:02] <gilberth> What has the brexit to do with that? Must you get your bits through customs?
[21:28:02] <MichaelRaskin> shka: of all things, number of engines shouldn't matter that much, should it? SpaceX is rather good at shutting down misbehaving ones in-flight, and they are sinking both stages anyway. Now, «so many intricate launch site structures, please gain a kilometer of altitude before blowing up»…
[21:42:52] <shka> MichaelRaskin: logically you are right
[21:43:16] <shka> but this looks unusual to say the least
[21:46:22] <MichaelRaskin> Well, having NASA agree to «yep, we miscalculated the engine margins of maintenance error, so a critical seal burned through — but that's why it is no big deal in two different ways» is also unusual!

[22:40:16] <gilberth> Heh. This reminds me of one of the star trek episodes, where they arrived at a planet inhabitated by reptiles, who fled from earth a long, long time ago. Maybe they'll return.
[22:40:34] <shka> voyager
[22:41:04] <shka> it was ok episode 
[22:41:56] <gilberth> I didn't remember which series it was. Thanks.
[22:43:06] <gilberth> I still find the idea interesting that there once was intelligent live on earth. Could a highly developed civilization leave earth leaving no evidence?
[22:43:41] <aeth> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silurian_hypothesis
[22:43:41] <shka> unlikely
[22:44:09] <shka> but not impossible
[22:44:38] <shka> we would have detect a large scale, global, industrial civilization
[22:44:41] <aeth> other possibilities also exist, such as Mars and Venus
[22:44:50] <gilberth> Ah, that idea has a name? Good to know! Perhaps I'll google a bit and read up.
[22:44:52] <aeth> arguably, Venus does show a sign of a large scale, global, industrial civilization
[22:44:59] <aeth> runaway greenhouse effect
[22:45:03] <shka> aeth: nah
[22:46:00] <shka> the problem with the hypothesis is that there is no data whatsoever to back it up
[22:47:00] <selwyn> hm
[22:47:41] <selwyn> entirely possible that there are human civilisations that have pretty much vanished without a trace
[22:47:56] <aeth> shka: the simpler explanation is to assume non-life causes; however, if the life on Venus stuff did wind up showing some traces of life (afaik, the recent news didn't work out), then we would need to reasses our probabilities
[22:48:13] <selwyn> consider how little we know about the bronze age collapse and mycenaen civilisation
[22:48:32] <aeth> shka: since it would seem plausible to me that some extremophile bacteria would survive no matter how badly we'd mess up the Earth
[22:48:37] <gilberth> selwyn: Sure, but highly developed ones? I doubt that.
[22:48:42] <shka> i simply don't think that this interest is warranted
[22:48:46] <aeth> shka: so now we'd have to consider if it's the only life or if it's the only remaining life
[22:49:31] <aeth> shka: similarly, if we discovered life on Mars or traces of it, we'd have to consider if civiliizations lived on Mars when it was habitable. Unlikely, ofc, considering how long it took life to evolve on Earth
[22:49:52] <aeth> It's only unlikely given that life currently appears to be very rare
[22:50:06] <shka> aeth: that's a big if
[22:50:42] <shka> and a helluva jump to conclusion
[22:51:21] <selwyn> shka: consider the molybdenum problem
[22:51:29] <aeth> shka: right, it is a jump
[22:51:53] <aeth> shka: right now, life seems extremely rare
[22:52:59] <aeth> we would need something dramatic, and thus unlikely, to change our views on this
[22:53:04] <gilberth> aeth: Well, it could have happened faster. What's up with mammals for instance? Dominated too long by dinosaurs? And then what took humans so long to settle? However, if the latter was a good move, is another question.
[22:53:29] <shka> aeth: discovery of extraterrestial life would be easily the most important discovery of the XXI century
[22:53:31] <shka> for sure
[22:53:33] <aeth> gilberth: if you view the goal of life to maximize population, then settled civilization was a very good move

[22:59:57] <selwyn> farms are boring
[23:11:07] <aeth> gilberth: we're in the awkward middle phase between the start of industrialization and convincing virtual reality
[23:11:37] <gilberth> The idea of property implies existance of poverty.
[23:12:50] <gilberth> aeth: I don't know whether I'd like the idea of VR. Wasn't there some movie around that idea? Can't remember really.
[23:12:57] <aeth> convincing virtual reality eliminates scarcity, provided there exists at least some way to access "territory" that's not paywalled
[23:13:07] <aeth> non-food scarcity, anyway
[23:13:22] <aeth> right now, the main necessary scarcity is real estate
[23:13:35] <aeth> convincing virtual reality devalues land
[23:16:23] <pjb> real estate scarcity is mostly artificial, imposed by taxes and land use laws.
[23:16:44] <gilberth> aeth: Could that also cure my scarcity of social contacts? I doubt, it could.
[23:16:47] <pjb> Kill all the politicians, and basically land becomes free again. 
[23:17:15] <pjb> politicians cannot be killed all, as soon as you do that, some new bully politician comes and call himself landlord.
