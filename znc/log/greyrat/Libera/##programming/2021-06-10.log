[00:28:57] <adder> anyone can think of a good async programming exercise?

[00:36:05] <mrig> InPhase: what would aliasing rules be in that context? 
[00:36:19] <InPhase> Rookie mode does the analyses all in the gui thread, and then things go non-responsive and people get upset at the unusable interface when the problems get hard to compute.  :)  So it's a useful skill to make those operate in the background.

[00:37:15] <adder> right, been there :)
[00:38:16] <InPhase> mrig: Well if you have a command come in as a uint32_t for example, and you have a 32-bit struct with bitfields, you have to memcpy it in to avoid UB.  Attempting to cast and assign is formally improper.  It will "usually" compile to the identical code, and people do it because it's more intuitive, but the compilers are allowed to abuse your code then under optimization.

[00:41:22] <mrig> go is quite nice in that you can put methods on types so bit twiddling can be done by way of a method on an int, which abstracts away the operators when you are reading the code, which seems to work quite nicely.
[00:42:08] <mrig> Means I have half a chance of remembering to think with them, which is really my goal in using them.
[00:42:32] <InPhase> mrig: Well I think most of the problems with bit field portability arise from people packing them in structs next to other data, and getting padding effects that they do not like.

[02:10:50] <alycidyne> Hello, how would one design interrupt handling in an arch which doesn't assume the existence of a stack?
[02:11:20] <alycidyne> The only other model I know of is the S/360 which stores the PSW at address 0

[02:13:14] *** Quits: dmu (~darkmusic@user/darkmusic) (Quit: leaving)
[02:13:47] <Twix> alycidyne, you(as a isa architect) would specify where your isa is gonna store the return address and the compiler developer would specify in its calling convention how to handle this given fact.
[02:14:14] <Twix> Using some special address or register is usually the way you would implement that.

[02:17:19] <arahael> thoigh kotlin and swift seem to have surged in android and ios respectively.
[02:17:34] <alycidyne> Twix: true... I mean, interrupts get handled in the interrupted address space or in their own address space?
[02:17:45] <Twix> alycidyne, you could also think of a architecture using multible register sets. You could reserve a whole register set for your interrupt routine and simply switch back to the other one if the isr has finished.
[02:18:02] <Twix> alycidyne, depends on the hardware
[02:18:11] <Twix> most microcontrollers use the same address space
[02:18:56] <Twix> some microcontrollers, e.g. esp32, have a special region in the sram where you can store things which need to be quick(e.g. interrupt service routines)
[02:19:02] <mib_373tg5> alycidyne: swift is language? 
[02:19:11] <alycidyne> Twix: yeah, forgot about using a different register set, fair point
[02:19:16] <alycidyne> mib_373tg5: AFAIK yes
[02:19:38] <alycidyne> mib_373tg5: (if Apple hasn't blown it into a full framework/whatever yet)
[02:20:13] <arahael> alycidyne: they have done that, too :)
[02:20:17] <Twix> afair the avr32 architecture had multible register sets. To ease implementation of a scheduler and reduce its overhead
[02:20:44] *** jazzy2 is now known as jazzy
[02:21:03] <Twix> but avr32 wasn't popular at all. I never used it
[02:21:16] <beaky> avr32 sounds high performance 
[02:21:38] <vdamewood> 32 is such an obsolete number. Everything better be 64+ these days.

[02:22:22] <alycidyne> Twix: well register sets for interrupts date back to the EE KDF9 (1964)
[02:22:38] <alycidyne> Twix: so it's not exactly new. But it is surprisingly rare IMO
[02:22:51] <Twix> its a simple and easy solution. But you need a bigger register file
[02:24:05] <alycidyne> arahael: good grief :D
[02:24:24] * alycidyne needs to get out of his spaceship from time to time
[02:24:28] <arahael> alycidyne: it's a pretty decent language, though i wish the compiler was better :)
[02:24:59] <beaky> why are register files called register files when they're not files
[02:25:25] <beaky> or are they a file as in a row i.e. array
[02:25:51] <alycidyne> beaky: it's a historical matter
[02:25:52] <beaky> i thought it would be an actual file
[02:26:03] <beaky> like /dev/registers
[02:26:35] <alycidyne> beaky: the original usage was a "file of punched cards"
[02:26:36] <mercenary> for the same reason directories are called folders
[02:27:06] <alycidyne> (so "file" here is used as "row", yes)
[02:27:15] <beaky> o
[02:27:36] <beaky> yes now my mind is blown
[02:27:49] <beaky> a file of punch cards makes perfect sensee
[02:27:55] <beaky> but what about folders
[02:28:06] <beaky> they dont put punchcards in folders i think
[02:28:20] <alycidyne> Though if we must be rigorous, we should say "a file of bytes" or "a file of records"
[02:28:27] <beaky> so maybe the folder thing is newer than files
[02:28:28] *** Joins: xkuru (~xkuru@user/xkuru)
[02:29:15] <arahael> beaky: it is.
[02:29:17] <alycidyne> e.g. "the database is a file of tuples recording the word and the pages in which it occurs"
[02:29:20] <mercenary> folders came with the desktop metaphor, things that you put files in
[02:29:41] <arahael> beaky: the first filesystems, if i recall, didn't have directories.

[02:30:29] <beaky> so now thinking of files as arrays the whole universe makes perfect sense to me now 
[02:30:38] <alycidyne> Of course, if we *really* want to be rigorous we should call files datasets and directories catalogues :)
[02:30:48] <mercenary> CP/M did not (if one does not count the wheel byte)
[02:31:12] <beaky> nice i have to try cpm i heard it is like dos but less ergonomic
[02:31:24] <mercenary> Or libraries. I remember some mainframe where the concept of a directory was called a library
[02:32:12] <alycidyne> beaky: want to really blow your mind? Think of byte stream files as just tables of a relational schema where tuple just associates the byte index with the byte value :)

[07:00:10] <audiocat> arahael, original music as in... not a cover, and not not-music
[07:00:31] <audiocat> like if i search "Jimi Hendrix All Along the Watchtower" i want the actual song, not a cover or some documentary
[07:00:33] <audiocat> arahael, 
[07:00:53] <audiocat> i don't see how that is not clear
[07:01:28] <arahael> audiocat: The dictionary has a very different definition. :)  Ah, I'd suggest you clarify that, then.
[07:01:46] <audiocat> arahael, well i say that in my SO question
[07:02:37] <arahael> audiocat: You state two requirements - firstly, that it's original, and secondly, that it not be a cover.

[07:07:23] <audiocat> i guess "original" can be ambiguous
[07:07:47] <mfiano> In this case you are not generating a fingerprint, just matching a database to a set of query results.
[07:07:50] <arahael> audiocat: You'll have better luck with that now, though I am still doubtful you'll get a good answer as it's a bit of a "difficult" problem.  SO tends to like easy ones that merely require some hidden knowledge.  You'll probably need to use some sort of database of such songs, I guess, and perhaps compare them heuristically.  Unfortunately, this might be the very thing you're trying to
[07:07:52] <arahael> construct...
[07:07:54] <mfiano> So no, you wouldn't need samples

[13:08:28] <mrig> alycidyne: sorry about that :|
[13:08:42] <PlanckWalk> Looks like both left and right shifts by too many bits are undefined in C++
[13:08:48] <alycidyne> sooooo... what is *less* bad then in your opinion, shifting left or shifting right?
[13:08:54] <PlanckWalk> So again no difference
[13:09:20] <PlanckWalk> I definitely prefer shifting to make a mask, if you must shift something.
[13:09:45] <PlanckWalk> If the amount you're shifting is a compile-time constant, then so is the mask.

[13:11:51] <alycidyne> *sigh* :| I personally find the right shift safer and easier, especially with bit strings
[13:12:27] <PlanckWalk> It seems to me to make much more sense to test data against a mask, rather than shifting the data.
[13:12:51] <PlanckWalk> (and then testing with a different mask)
[13:13:30] <PlanckWalk> Especially if you want to test multiple bit positions.
[13:13:46] <PlanckWalk> I don't see how you'd even reasonably express that with data shifting.

[17:14:37] <nicolapcweek94> also, for diagramming work i've found plantuml is the fastest way to acceptable output
[17:14:45] <mrig> so I just make an svg and push that to a server to get the same thing now.
[17:14:46] <nicolapcweek94> and when it isn't, pay for a Microsoft Visio license
[17:15:07] <^-^hi> mrig: what about dot?
[17:15:18] <nicolapcweek94> interesting though, weird that it would break like that
[17:15:23] <mrig> Enterprise architect is nice, but I am discarding it for this reason.
[17:15:31] <nicolapcweek94> wonder what they did so awfully to get in such a state
[17:15:34] <mrig> it is JS that has broken it.
[17:15:42] <mrig> the JS ecosystem.
[17:15:50] <nicolapcweek94> yeah but in what part of the whole thing?
[17:15:55] <nicolapcweek94> do they output js that is now invalid?
[17:15:56] <mrig> ^-^hi: oh, what is dot?
[17:16:03] <nicolapcweek94> do they depent on js packages that don;t work anymore?
[17:16:09] <mrig> nicolapcweek94: I think so yes, it is now invalid.

[17:16:24] <mrig> I forget what the error was now off hand.
[17:16:29] <nicolapcweek94> well that's just bad programming on their side then, isn't it?
[17:16:32] <nicolapcweek94> not really JS fault

[17:24:38] <arahael> mrig: :)  I think it's LGPL, if it's a literal rewrite, the result will probably need to be LGPL.
[17:25:05] <arahael> I mean, if you're just mechanically rewriting it.
[17:25:16] <nicolapcweek94> i think even if you just look at the code no?
[17:25:30] <mrig> Oh right, if working literally from that code base, I was thinking more along the lines of working from inspiration.
[17:25:37] <nicolapcweek94> doesn't it kinda have to be a clean room reimplementation to avoid the GPL?
[17:26:40] <arahael> nicolapcweek94: I imagine you'd have to clarify that with a lawyer.

[17:31:10] <nicolapcweek94> mrig: they're actually fairly different "under the hood"
[17:31:20] <mrig> Seem that GPL is a little stricter than BSD?
[17:31:43] <nicolapcweek94> GPL's main thing is that it is infectious
[17:31:49] <mrig> oh that's cool, it could be that there is already some faster starting version out there.
[17:32:14] <mrig> But the writing of something like that would be a perfect intro to a more involved graphics program.
[17:32:26] <nicolapcweek94> infectious in the sense that GPL code can only be used in GPL licensed code
[17:32:44] <nicolapcweek94> afaik, this is not legal advice and all
[17:33:28] <mrig> Right BSD can be used in proprietary code, seems to be the big difference.
[17:34:06] <mrig> no source available, I suppose is the main difference there.
[17:34:43] <mrig> If the source were available to the Enterprise Architect program, the JS bug fix would likely be pretty simple.

[17:48:49] <nicolapcweek94> W: isn't the assignment requirement because they want the freedom to change license at will?
[17:49:05] <W> nicolapcweek94, the justification is separate from whether it legally works or not
[17:49:08] <nicolapcweek94> ie: move projects from GPLv3 to GPLv4 whenever that happens
[17:49:16] <W> but yes, I do believe that is the given rationale
[17:49:27] <nicolapcweek94> yeah true, was just saying
[17:49:35] <nicolapcweek94> legally yes they're very different things
[17:49:53] <nicolapcweek94> and as far as i know the GPL isn't even really litigated in court
[17:49:58] <W> if it DOES work, it also allows them to distribute and create derivative works distributed under any other license, including unfree ones
[17:50:07] <nicolapcweek94> plenty of android phone makes that don't publish their kernels
[17:50:33] <W> GPL has been tested in a couple of courts on clear cut cases where whether something is a derivative work or not is not in question
[17:50:49] <W> (because the copyright infringement did not even modify the code)
[17:51:18] <nicolapcweek94> (Xiaomi for one is known for this)
[17:51:18] <InPhase> nicolapcweek94: There have been a significant number of GPL court cases already.  The courts have broadly held that the GPL is well within standard license content, and is fully enforceable as written.
[17:51:42] <InPhase> nicolapcweek94: Notably I don't think any case has ever found anything other than that.
[17:52:28] <mrig> I gather that it is suppose to protect an author from having their code stolen from them by someone that has copied it?
[17:52:41] <W> things NOT tested in courts include whether using (linking to, referring to, using the headers off, and similar) GPL code and distributing it as GPL while claiming another (incompatible) license on the referring work
[17:52:45] <mrig> Some aspect of the GPL is founded in this notion.
[17:52:50] <nicolapcweek94> InPhase: huh, then do they just not care about being sued (and probably losing)?
[17:53:00] <InPhase> nicolapcweek94: They who?
[17:53:03] <W> ...counts as derivative work and so is against the license
[17:53:18] <nicolapcweek94> phone makers etc
[17:53:37] <InPhase> nicolapcweek94: Who do you think is in violation?

[17:54:56] <InPhase> nicolapcweek94: Note that it can take a long time to go through such a court case, and someone has to be willing to file a suit to do an enforcement.
[17:55:05] <nicolapcweek94> ah ok

[18:05:25] <W> copyright law pertains to the dissemination and distribution of works only, and cannot restrict you from working on any and all code, beyond making the lack of such work a condition of a license you actually want

[18:34:43] <W> the matrix has to be an orthogonal matrix for it to be a rotation, meaning it has to be the inverse of its transpose, which explains why the signs are not symmetric, but not why which is which

[20:03:16] <mrig> There are a few choices.
[20:04:02] <PlanckWalk> Guest0: whatever the volume control is on XFCE4 panel does per-application volume control (including muting)
[20:04:04] <mrig> well you can add extra widgets but usually you can just do this from you distros main window controls.
[20:04:47] <adder`> i feel like switching distros but i've no idea what i'd switch to
[20:04:54] <PlanckWalk> I just click the speaker icon and select "Audio mixer.."
[20:05:32] <mrig> pulse: I found VS to be to mouse oriented for my taste, and a little to heavy; And of course out of the question if you are using the package manager vetted source.
[20:06:04] <pulse> ah, not disk provisioning but "storage sense". supposedly saves space on smaller drives
[20:06:15] <adder`> and just thinking about setting the whole system up again makes me throw up
[20:06:15] <mrig> So it is not controlled for integrity, also you have to hunt around to find the version that is not full of malware.
[20:06:28] <pulse> mrig, it's the best IDE i've ever used, by far
[20:06:34] <pulse> it helps you write good code, that's all i care about
[20:06:45] <Guest0> ahh there's a volume control
[20:06:47] <pulse> the debugger is off the charts good, and autocompletion engine is ridiculously good

[20:11:10] <pulse> for me when i write code i want to use the best tool for the job
[20:11:23] <mrig> I want my code to be the best that it can.

[20:11:28] <pulse> i'd prefer heavy machinery

[20:17:35] <mrig> pulse: sure so?
[20:17:47] <pulse> so not using the mouse doesn't make sense :p
[20:17:55] <pulse> i learned vim for that exact reason too
[20:18:06] <pulse> i thought it would be cool to code with vim on a laptop because you wouldn't need any mouse
[20:18:13] <pulse> so i did, and i still use vim more or less daily, it's cool
[20:18:20] <pulse> but i dropped the whole no-mouse thing
[20:18:25] <mrig> when i use a mouse it gives me carpal tunnel.
[20:18:26] <pulse> because it's quite ridiculous in my mind
[20:18:45] <nicolapcweek94> hey, it is cool to use vim on a laptop, especially using hjkl instead of arrows
[20:18:45] <pulse> do wrist exercises every day, i've been doing them for decades and haven't had any trouble
[20:18:54] <pulse> it is cool to use vim on a laptop, i agree
[20:19:01] <pulse> but the point i was making is that you're writing code for maybe 1% of the time
[20:19:14] <pulse> and you're still gonna use that mouse when you scroll through docs, presumably
[20:19:16] <pyzozord> pulse: I disagree, all you do all day is typing or talking to people or thinking. It is more than 0.02%. I'd estimate 30%
[20:19:28] <pulse> pyzozord, it varies, sure
[20:19:33] <pulse> it depends on how mundane the code is
[20:19:37] <nicolapcweek94> i'd say more abt 10%, but i see the point
[20:19:37] <pulse> simple code, maybe up to 30% yeah
[20:19:41] <pulse> complex code, maybe about 10%
[20:19:46] <nicolapcweek94> but you can still move through docs and navigate the code in vim
[20:19:46] <pulse> ridiculously complex code, 0.01%
[20:19:48] <mrig> pulse I fully agree, the most important thing is the mind.
[20:20:15] <mrig> nicolapcweek94: you should be using regexp not hjkl :D

[20:21:33] <nicolapcweek94> though my vim usage these days is mostly macros
[20:21:41] <mrig> in vim I mean the / and ? buttions are awesome.
[20:21:43] <nicolapcweek94> mrig: no i use marks for navigation

[20:23:29] <pulse> like try the touchpad on a 15 year old laptop
[20:23:31] <pulse> and then try it on the macbook
[20:23:38] <pulse> it's insane how much better it is
[20:23:48] <nicolapcweek94> pyzozord: i've also used trackpoints for years but recent touchpads (and no, the x230 is not recent) are light years better
[20:23:54] <pyzozord> pulse: yeah that could be the part of it, this touchpad feels like 2012 and that's just not a great feeling for touchpads
[20:24:16] <nicolapcweek94> not even talking about the macbooks, that are basically a huge touchpad with something attached to it
[20:24:24] <mrig> nicolapcweek94: you can not recreate the UI of vim in a mouse dependent environment that also has it own key mappings, it just not possible to do, attempting it sort of misses the point.
[20:24:35] <nicolapcweek94> but even my razer blade stealth 2017 has a good touchpad
[20:24:48] <nicolapcweek94> mrig: that's what i'm saying
[20:24:54] <mrig> The other app always walks over the vim functionality.
[20:25:02] <mrig> nicolapcweek94: Yes I fully agree with you.
[20:25:16] <nicolapcweek94> most people say "just use vim bindings in (intellij|vscode|visual studio|whatever)"
[20:25:21] <mrig> keyboard before mouse is the thing.
[20:25:25] <pyzozord> but I'm still not a big fan of cursor things, I feel keyboards are faster, more precise, less missclicks, less movement, better muscle memmory, more brain space for higher level functions
[20:25:30] <nicolapcweek94> but that's completely different from vim itself
[20:26:08] <mrig> It is not vim itself no, it is the UI of the keyboard taking precedence over the mouse.
[20:26:25] <mrig> this is why vim mode in emacs can work.
[20:26:39] <nicolapcweek94> only one that gets somewhat close to vim is Evil, and imho that's because emacs is similarly keyboard focused itself
[20:26:41] <pyzozord> I honestly use a cursor only for the browser, because there isn't a sane way to not use it. There are some vim-like plugins for browsers but that's just kind of strange
[20:27:18] <nicolapcweek94> pyzozord: on firefox i use tridactyl which is fairly decent
[20:27:18] <mrig> pyzozord: What do you mean by a cursor only?
[20:27:33] <Guest0> pyzozord: in your entire system you only use the mouse for the browser?
[20:27:40] <mrig> for the browser.
[20:27:47] <pyzozord> mrig: I mean mouse/touchpad/trackpad kind of stuff, devices that control the mouse pointer on the screen
[20:28:07] <pyzozord> Guest0: yeah, pretty much
[20:28:10] <mrig> ah I see, right, was thinking of the terminal cursor and the design pattern :D
[20:28:14] <Guest0> impressive. respect
[20:28:14] <pulse> pyzozord, they're different input devices. for some things keyboards are superior, for others mouse is. for some touch is superior
[20:28:20] <pulse> i could easily come up with 10s of examples for each
[20:28:36] <pulse> try to manage files with the keyboard alone vs. a mouse
[20:28:42] <pulse> like categorizing a huge photo library
[20:28:47] <pulse> it's infinitely easier with a mouse
[20:28:54] <pyzozord> Guest0: I mean I don't force myself to never ever use it but, I mostly operate my machine from the terminal window
[20:29:15] <Guest0> that makes sense then
[20:29:20] <mrig> pulse: you are joking right? The command line is way better for manipulating exif info on images.
[20:29:30] <mrig> GUI for visualising sure.
[20:29:31] <pulse> mrig, i said categorizing, not manipulating exif
[20:29:42] <mrig> but a cursor would be fine there too.
[20:29:46] <Guest0> mrig: or sixel
[20:29:59] <pulse> or if you want a far better example, try autocad or image manipulation
[20:30:05] <pyzozord> pulse: true :) arguing over superiority of keyboard over mouse is pointless, obviously the most superior is the cat
[20:30:13] <pulse> or anything to do with sound or mastering
[20:30:16] <mrig> auto cad a track ball as far better.
[20:30:20] <nicolapcweek94> for autocad there's openscad :D
[20:30:26] <mrig> or using the precise coordinates. 
[20:30:34] <pulse> heh
[20:30:43] <mrig> pulse: sound is better without a screen :D
[20:30:59] <deniska> autocad comes with a lisp interpreter, doesn't it? :P
[20:31:00] <pulse> yeah unless you actually need visualizations in order to cut and apply mastering properly
[20:31:02] <pyzozord> btw of input devices that reminds of that fancy device that let you move your hands freely in 3d space
[20:31:07] <nicolapcweek94> deniska: yep it does
[20:31:14] <pulse> and touch is superior for anything that uses multitouch gestures
[20:31:29] <pulse> navigating a map for example is the easiest on touch

[23:50:17] <InPhase> Guest97: The right solution depends on the level.  I think there are tons of such systems designed as games for children.  If you want to scale up to being able to type out text like a well-educated adult professional, then you could arrange practice by something like taking a text of interest, running it through text to speech, and then trying to type it out.  Then you can compare to the original 
[23:50:23] <InPhase> source.

[23:52:13] <Guest97> typing tutor is not suitable when i cook
[23:52:21] <InPhase> Guest97: The most important thing you can do though, is assign constant attention to it in everything you type, for any purpose.  If you're ever uncertain about how to spell any word you're typing, check it as you're typing it.  Then keep doing it over and over again.  Then, engage in lots of discussions where you have to type about various things, and keep forcing yourself to encounter more words 
[23:52:27] <InPhase> you need to type.
[23:53:19] <InPhase> Guest97: I would suggest combining it with an attention to grammar as well, because English spelling does not really exist in isolation from grammatical structure.  There are lots of words that sound identical but are spelled differently, and the right one to select depends on the context of what is being said.

[23:55:13] <Guest97> i cant type GeDaMo
[23:55:21] <beaky> yes i myself have very bad grammar like i never capitalize or use punctuation or check my spelling so my english language ability has stalled
[23:55:30] <GeDaMo> You can practice spelling and typing at the same time :P
[23:55:42] <Guest97> typing is not in my to do list
[23:56:15] <InPhase> Guest97: You're typing right now!  You're just not using capitalization, punctuation, and proper grammar and spelling.  :)

[23:58:41] <beaky> yes the bonus of improving your typing ability is being able to more conveniently type out punctuation symbols and stuff required for well formed sentences (that i dont pay attention too do as i say not as i do lol)
[23:59:10] <Guest97> i am not sure when typing is will become obsolete
[23:59:25] <Guest97> x-is
[23:59:53] <InPhase> Guest97: When high-throughput neural implants became prevalent.
