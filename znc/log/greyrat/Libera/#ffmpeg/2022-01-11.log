[01:02:31] <guilhermek[m]> Hello, I'm using OBS on Linux to record my screen with NVENC. But starting from FFmpeg 4.4, most of recorded frames are dropped when using the high quality preset. I'm not seeing anybody commenting about this, so I assume it only affects older NVIDIA GPUs (e.g. mine is a Kepler)
[01:03:44] <guilhermek[m]> Looking at ffmpeg
[01:07:39] <guilhermek[m]> Looking at ffmpeg's code in avcodec/nvenc.c, I noticed that compat presets were introduced to replace deprecated ones (commit: https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/commit/11a8e93681dfe51c75683ac5a13b72d4bed7ac1f), so the previous "hq" preset OBS relied on with ffmpeg 4.3, now points to this new "p7" preset, so it appears that this p7 preset is causing issues somehow. I'm not a developer myself but I'd be happy to investigate this further
[01:07:39] <guilhermek[m]> with a help of an actual developer

[04:34:09] <BtbN> Whatever is before the first colon will be interpreted as protocol
[04:34:34] <BtbN> so if you have files with that (which is a very bad idea to have anyway), you got to specify it's just file explicitly.
[04:35:15] <iconoclasthero> so change -i "$file" to -i file: "$file" ?
[04:35:30] <BtbN> well, in the correct URI format, but yes

[04:35:53] <iconoclasthero> correct URI format?
[04:36:15] <BtbN> something like file:./? Just try it until you find what it likes.
[04:37:19] <furq> just "file:$file" should work
[04:37:30] <furq> it seems to work fine with relative paths
[04:39:03] <iconoclasthero> yeah, that works but you have to do the same thing with the output file name.
[04:39:18] <BtbN> Well, obviously, if you still have a : in there.
[04:39:45] <iconoclasthero> it's just weird that it only does it with single word files.
[04:41:03] <furq> if there's a space before the : then it's obviously not a protocol
[04:41:35] <furq> or i guess anything that's not in \w

[04:54:01] <BtbN> that's legitimately worse than in filenames :D

[04:59:29] <guilhermek[m]> Hello, I'm basically having 95%+ of dropped frames while recording with OBS using NVENC + FFmpeg 4.4 using any of the High Quality profiles. This is not reproducible with FFmpeg 4.3 and while bisecting the issue, I was lead to this FFmpeg commit: https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/commit/11a8e93681dfe51c75683ac5a13b72d4bed7ac1f
[04:59:50] <guilhermek[m]> Should I report this to FFmpeg developers or not?
[05:00:10] <iconoclasthero> What can I say?  I like using a colon to separate the subtitle from the title; first issue since at least August 2019.  Anyway, thanks for the help.

[05:00:41] <BtbN> guilhermek[m], very unlikely that commit caused a regression like that.
[05:00:54] <BtbN> nvenc works just fine on latest 4.4 and master.
[05:01:09] <BtbN> You're aware OBS has long NIH'd the nvenv implementation, and is not using ffmpeg for it anymore?
[05:01:11] <BtbN> *nvenc
[05:01:35] <guilhermek[m]> This is on Linux, sorry. They're still using it: https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/blob/master/plugins/obs-ffmpeg/obs-ffmpeg-nvenc.c
[05:02:00] <BtbN> Yeah, the old code is still there. But it's not used anymore, unless you explicitly select it.
[05:02:13] <BtbN> So wouldn't surprise me if it broke.
[05:02:33] <guilhermek[m]> What do you mean unless I explicitly select it? I'm using OBS'
[05:02:40] <guilhermek[m]> default NVENC values
[05:02:43] <BtbN> Yes, and OBS by default does not use ffmpeg for nvenc.
[05:02:57] <guilhermek[m]> Huh
[05:03:09] <guilhermek[m]> What would they use it then?
[05:03:22] <BtbN> They implemented an nvenc encoder themselves for some reason.
[05:03:24] <BtbN> Don't ask me why.
[05:04:21] <guilhermek[m]> I don't understand. And I don't think that's correct. When I hit record on OBS I see this in the console:
[05:04:21] <guilhermek[m]> [h264_nvenc @ 0x55af4334b800] Using global_quality with nvenc is deprecated. Use qp instead.
[05:04:28] <guilhermek[m]> Isn't that literally from ffmpeg's code?
[05:04:53] <BtbN> So you must have explicitly selected their legacy encoder
[05:05:02] <BtbN> Or have not updated OBS in a long (very long) time
[05:06:20] <BtbN> You'll ideally need to try and reproduce the issue with the ffmpeg CLI tool. Can't really debug anything that OBS does somewhere in its rather large codebase.
[05:06:51] <BtbN> And like I said, nvenc works fine for me on both latest 4.4 and master, going as fast as I'd exect it to for 1080p
[05:07:09] <guilhermek[m]> I'm using OBS 27.1.3, which is the latest stable release. Plus, there's no legacy encoder to be selected (https://i.imgur.com/Mq0iuGB.png)
[05:07:12] <guilhermek[m]> Are you on Windows?
[05:07:19] <guilhermek[m]> I'
[05:07:30] <BtbN> Works on both Windows and Linux
[05:07:42] <guilhermek[m]> Sorry for sending incomplete messages, my keyboard is broken
[05:08:04] <guilhermek[m]> I understand that, which is why I'm saying this could be affecting only older NVIDIA GPUs, such as Kepler
[05:08:08] <BtbN> https://i.imgur.com/lLif1xd.png latest OBS looks like this. The legacy encoder is gone.
[05:08:13] <guilhermek[m]> Unless you have an older GPU as well?
[05:08:27] <guilhermek[m]> BtbN: That's on Windows, though.
[05:08:35] <BtbN> Yes, so?
[05:08:50] <BtbN> Nothing about that is different on Linux.
[05:09:18] <guilhermek[m]> Yes it is. OBS still uses ffmpeg on Linux. No clue about Windows
[05:09:47] <guilhermek[m]> I literally linked the code
[05:10:04] <BtbN> Yes, the code of the still existing legacy encoder. Which I guess they disabled nowadays.
[05:10:07] <BtbN> Not sure what to tell you
[05:10:27] <BtbN> Are you recording in 4K or something? I could maybe see that commit you found to cause that to slow down, when the default preset is slightly more demanding.
[05:10:35] <BtbN> Other than that, I don't see how it's possible.
[05:11:54] <BtbN> If you think something in ffmpeg is broken, best build or grab a build of the latest ffmpeg cli tool, and try to reproduce with that.
[05:12:08] <BtbN> If it's literally only broken in OBS, the issue is most likely OBS.
[05:12:13] <guilhermek[m]> BtbN: No, I'm recording at 1080p @ 60fps. The dropped frames thing only happens when I select any of the "High Quality" profiles on OBS. And this _only_ happens with FFmpeg 4.4
[05:12:54] <BtbN> 1080p60 should not make any nvidia card of the last decade break a sweat, even on the most aggressive settings.
[05:12:56] <guilhermek[m]> BtbN: Probably, but if it used to work in FFmpeg 4.3, wouldn't this be a regression in FFmpeg and not a problem in OBS?
[05:13:18] <guilhermek[m]> BtbN: Not even an old one like GTX 660?
[05:13:46] <BtbN> No, literally the very first cards with nvenc pumped several hundred to thousands of FPS at 1080p, depending on quality settings
[05:13:58] <BtbN> 1080p60 was never an issue
[05:14:23] <guilhermek[m]> As I understand it, FFmpeg 4.4 introduced compat profiles that are used to replace the legacy ones. So, when OBS asks the "hq" profile, FFmpeg 4.4 gives it the newer p7 profile. Could this p7 profile be causing issues?
[05:14:49] <BtbN> It's just a new naming scheme for the presets, since the old ones were a hot mess
[05:16:38] <BtbN> Can you even use those _at all_ on such an old card? Given they need a fairly recent driver, and that probably is using a legacy driver?
[05:16:41] <guilhermek[m]> I see... However, newer NVENC versions have a bunch of features my card doesn't support. For instance, there's this option called "Psycho-Visual Tunning" in OBS, which when enabled, fails to even begin recording
[05:16:56] <BtbN> Well, yes, that's about expected with older cards.
[05:17:12] <guilhermek[m]> BtbN: Yes, I can use other presets other than the High Quality ones. For example, the Low Latency one works just fine.
[05:17:43] <guilhermek[m]> So, isn't it possible that FFMpeg is enabling a new feature causing NVENC to cripple with my ancient GPU?
[05:18:08] <BtbN> How would it possibly enable features that aren't there? It'd just fail if it did that.
[05:18:43] <guilhermek[m]> By the way, I don't know if you have time, but I have a video recording of me going through OBS' presets and showing the ones who fail: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AvTHiH9i24
[05:18:43] <guilhermek[m]> I honestly don't know, just guessing
[05:18:48] <BtbN> Like I said, multiple times now: Please try and reproduce with the ffmpeg cli tool. There's nothing to work with when it's just OBS doing odd stuff.
[05:19:17] <BtbN> Some settings and presets that pre-date your card not working is normal and expected behaviour.
[05:20:04] <guilhermek[m]> I'll try to reproduce with ffmpeg, I just have no idea where to begin
[05:20:45] <BtbN> Apply the same settings you think OBS is, and see if it's unreasonably slow.
[05:21:28] <guilhermek[m]> Alright, I'll take a look at the documentation
[05:21:38] <guilhermek[m]> Thanks
[05:21:58] <BtbN> Just try one of the faster P-Presets if your card really can't do 1080p at 60 FPS on the highest quality one
[05:22:36] <guilhermek[m]> Would I just re-encode a video? Or can I use ffmpeg directly to record my screen?
[05:23:10] <BtbN> Can use testsrc or yuvtestsrc to generate some data. Eliminates slow disks.
[05:23:38] <guilhermek[m]> Okay, I'll give a try
[05:23:53] <guilhermek[m]> By the way my card can do 1080p60 just fine. With ffmpeg 4.3 though
[05:24:36] <BtbN> At what quality though? And with which settings?
[05:25:23] <BtbN> The legacy preset names have been picked such that they're roughly equivalent in terms of speed and quality, but it's obviously impossible to get it to a perfect match
[05:25:42] <guilhermek[m]> Well, OBS shows me this:... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/567ed83303b94af158b0fda86bf0b1b98e8bf36d)
[05:26:03] <BtbN> But 1080p60 was always the bare minimum nvidia aimed for, so no preset usually goes slower than that, even on old Kepler card
[05:27:32] <guilhermek[m]> I see. By the way, I'm re-doing the bisect just in case. Because in the first try I didn't `git bisect skip` the times I wasn't able to record with OBS. So this time around it might lead to a different commit
[05:28:24] <BtbN> You'll also normally just want to use the latest version of ffmpeg, not some release. They're just made to cater to distros release cycles.
[05:29:27] <BtbN> Also, a GTX 660 is on a legacy driver it seems, and just VERY barely still supports latest nvenc
[05:29:36] <guilhermek[m]> That's not in my control, though. The beta version of OBS has migrated to FFmpeg 4.4.1 (https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/pull/5686), so that's why I'm testing that version
[05:30:19] *** Quits: vlm (~vlm@user/vlm) (Quit: "")
[05:30:29] <guilhermek[m]> BtbN: It still has 2 years of extended support through the 470xx branch (on Linux), but yeah. The NVENC page on NVIDIA's website doesn't even list the 660 anymore
[05:31:02] <guilhermek[m]> However, if it used to work I don't see why it has to break now :(
[05:31:32] <BtbN> The next Video Codec SDK bump will not support it anymore though
[05:31:53] <guilhermek[m]> That's unfortunate
[05:32:00] <BtbN> 470.57.02 is the minimum linux driver version for Video Codec SDK 11.1
[05:32:13] <BtbN> Which is exactly the legacy driver series for that card
[05:32:32] <BtbN> So you won't ever be able to use more than 11.1 on that card.
[05:32:33] <guilhermek[m]> Yep. I'm on 470.94
[05:32:53] <BtbN> And if someone builds ffmpeg with a potential future SDK 11.2 or 12.0, it'll not work on that card anymore.
[05:33:42] <guilhermek[m]> That sucks... It seems I'll have to maintain my own working build of OBS
[05:33:44] *** Joins: Seirdy (~Seirdy@sourcehut/user/seirdy)
[05:33:51] <guilhermek[m]> But I also understand, it's a card from 2012
[05:34:05] <BtbN> Or just get a cheap new card
[05:34:17] <BtbN> cheapest thing with nvenc will outclass that old thing by worlds
[05:34:35] <guilhermek[m]> I live in Brazil, we probably have different definitions of "cheap" hahaha
[05:34:36] <BtbN> nvenc was quite shit until Pascal, and got super good with Turing
[05:35:07] <BtbN> a cheap old 1050 will be an upgrade by several magnitues of speed and quality
[05:35:08] <guilhermek[m]> I'm planning to get a 1650 in the future, though
[05:35:33] <BtbN> Anything Turing or Ampere will be a whole other world
[05:35:48] <BtbN> I think they're working on a 3050 or something
[05:35:51] <guilhermek[m]> Yep. To be honest I had the chance to upgrade before the shortage problem, but silly me, at the time I thought the prices were still "too high"
[05:36:16] <critr> haha, same, guilhermek[m]
[05:37:37] <BtbN> It also really seems like OBS has not updated the ffmpeg based nvenc thingy in ages. So you can't select any of the modern presets and settings to possibly fine-tune
[05:37:43] <guilhermek[m]> Aargh I don't even like remembering seeing a RX 580 for like $100 and not buying it
[05:38:01] <critr> a 1650 will hold the line for moderate tasks.
[05:38:16] <BtbN> If it's just about video encoding, the GPU is entirely irrelevant
[05:38:27] <BtbN> just needs to be the right generation of chip to have the latest nvenc silicon
[05:39:18] <guilhermek[m]> I'd be more than fine with a 1650 for the basic gaming I do. Heck, I'm still happy with my 660
[05:40:00] <furq> i wouldn't be surprised if a gtx 660 outperforms an rx580 for h264 encoding
[05:40:02] <guilhermek[m]> It's that I like to stream sometimes, and this recent update kinda broke things. Although I can still use the Low Latency preset just fine, so it's not that big of deal
[05:40:09] <furq> amf or whatever they're calling it this week has always been a way behind nvenc
[05:40:37] <BtbN> Kepler nvenc was very very bad
[05:40:50] <furq> fair enough
[05:40:51] <BtbN> to the point where it's almost unuseable unless you throw stupid amounts of bitrate at it
[05:41:55] <guilhermek[m]> Unusable in what sense? Shit quality?
[05:42:36] <BtbN> Yeah, it doesn't really have a sensible use, unless you can let it go wild with bitrate for archival purposes
[05:42:52] <BtbN> and than it easily chugs 100Mbit/s whenever motion heavy stuff happens
[05:43:15] <guilhermek[m]> lol
[05:43:38] <guilhermek[m]> Back when I used Windows I'd always record at 40k bitrate in Shadow Play
[05:43:58] <guilhermek[m]> For streaming on Twitch I just set it to 6k and it looks fine to my eyes
[05:44:18] <BtbN> Kepler at CBR 6k was unbelievably trashy quality
[05:44:26] <guilhermek[m]> Of course when stuff move around it looks like crap
[05:44:31] <BtbN> Unless you play Chess or something. Anything FPS... nope
[05:44:44] <guilhermek[m]> hahaha I agree
[05:45:07] <guilhermek[m]> Wait, does this situation heavily improve with newer GPUs?
[05:45:12] <guilhermek[m]> Good to know
[05:45:22] <BtbN> Yes, ever new chip generation, nvenc got better and better
[05:45:31] <BtbN> since Turing it rivals x264, which is quite impressive
[05:46:17] <guilhermek[m]> I'm pretty much an end user, so basically I thought everything could be improved by just changing the bitrate
[05:46:26] <guilhermek[m]> So, good to know that isn't the case
[05:46:47] <BtbN> nvenc is a literal bit of silicon
[05:46:55] <BtbN> it can't be updated via software
[05:47:20] <BtbN> I think at this point, it's basically done though.
[05:47:32] <BtbN> Ampere has the same nvenc chip as Turing, with only very minor additions
[05:48:10] <guilhermek[m]> Very cool
[05:48:49] <guilhermek[m]> Anyway, thanks for the help so far. I'll get back to my bisecting and if I find anything useful I'll report to one of you guys
[05:48:59] <guilhermek[m]> Thanks again, cya
[05:49:05] <BtbN> Should be very trivial to check if you found the right commit
[05:49:08] <BtbN> try the one right before
[05:49:18] <guilhermek[m]> Alright
[05:49:24] <BtbN> And if it is that specific commit, try just turning down the preset a notch. If OBS lets you...
[05:49:39] <BtbN> Like, the commit tells you what the mapping is
[05:50:06] <BtbN> hq is p7
[05:50:24] <BtbN> but I'd be very surprised if p7 can't do 1080p60
[05:50:39] <guilhermek[m]> The higher the 'p', the better the quality?
[05:50:48] <BtbN> Yes, p7 is the maximum
[05:50:58] <BtbN> and p1 the worst quality
[05:51:36] <guilhermek[m]> Good to know. Is there a place where I can see what "settings" are applied to which profile? Or that's controlled by the driver?
[05:51:45] <guilhermek[m]> s/which/each/
[05:51:46] <BtbN> That's entirely up to the driver
[05:52:00] <BtbN> it just gets the preset GUID from ffmpeg, and then dodes its thing
[05:52:01] <guilhermek[m]> That's not good
[05:52:04] <BtbN> *does

[09:17:11] <aphysically> haasn: how is/does dolby vision work on the profile 7 (I think it is?) stuff where it's detected as a separate video stream by ffmpeg
[09:17:50] <aphysically> is that just the MEL/FEL and vf_libplacebo can't apply it yet, or is that stuff not even supported by libplacebo anyway
[09:18:01] <aphysically> I was wondering how that would even work without a filter that has multiple inputs

[10:30:47] <Lynne> and if there is, it'll likely be up to the user to manage which stream is the main and which stream has the top 2 bits
[10:31:33] <Lynne> it's not neat, but the way dolby did it is a disgusting hack to put it mildly
[10:33:01] <Lynne> the main reason they split it up into 2 streams is because all consumer hardware decoders don't support decoding of 12-bit video

[11:02:21] <JEEB> a crapload of p7 stuff only has 0x00 bytes anyways so only the RPUs are there, in theory that could be remuxed into the primary stream and labeled as profile 8.x (whatever was the PQ one)

[11:16:49] <haasn> aphysically: yeah there's no support at all for EL in libplacebo
[11:17:03] <haasn> I'm also not sure if any samples strictly require it (have you seen any?)
[11:17:11] <haasn> in the sense of, like, it actually looking different/better
[11:17:59] <aphysically> well, I can't actually speak to how it looks with the MEL/FEL, but I haven't seen any samples that don't look subjectively normal without it
[11:18:03] <JEEB> the primary video is specifically made to be normal HDR10 so it definitely can be played w/o it. both of the discs I recently bought just had RPUs and the extra video stream was just 0x00 RPU container
[11:19:03] <JEEB> but there has been at least one sample where zomg the video data actually contained data
[11:20:54] <aphysically> I patched libplacebo to use bt2446a instead of bt2390 to play around with it using vf_libplacebo (I had thought I had done it wrong before, but I was getting mixed up with the broken tonemapping)
[11:21:09] <aphysically> it's nice the bugfix made it into 5.0 though
[11:22:00] <aphysically> (I just patched the old API to use the bt2446a function in the bt2390 slot)
[11:23:43] <aphysically> a lot of the stuff that was too dark before is brighter with bt2446a, but I found at least one example where bt2390 oversaturated it but bt2446a was darker
[11:23:57] <aphysically> HDR mastering seems like it's all over the place
[11:24:24] <haasn> ^
[11:24:35] <haasn> really I've been thinking about some sort of dynamic measurement of the histogram
[11:24:40] <haasn> so we can better estimate how the fuck this sample is mastered
[11:24:51] <haasn> but the main thing that gives me doubts about this approach is the inability for a histogram approach to detect creative intent
[11:24:56] <haasn> maybe a scene is _supposed_ to be very dark

[18:53:03] <nospoon> hi, can FFmpeg support HTTP Content-Encoding: br
[18:53:57] <kepstin> that's what, brotli? afaik not currently supported.
[18:55:41] <haasn> JEEB: not without AI
[18:55:49] <nospoon> yes Brotli algorithm
[18:56:51] *** Quits: Jerrk (~Jerrk@193.138.218.212) (Remote host closed the connection)
[18:56:54] <nospoon> any idea if the support will be availible?
[18:59:18] <nospoon> in the future
[19:00:21] <BtbN> Patches welcome
[19:00:55] <BtbN> But generally... why? Compressed audio/video does not typically compress further with lossless generic compression algorithms.
[19:02:54] <JEEB> maybe it's something like HLS/DASH manifests?
[19:04:31] <BtbN> that's so little data compared to the accompanying video
[19:04:55] <nospoon> some http streams send content compressed with Brotli algorithm. wich FFmpeg apparentlly cant handle at the moment
[19:05:12] <BtbN> HTTP should be smart enough to negotiate to not do that.
[19:05:30] <BtbN> As in, the server will only send brotli compressed responses if the client indicated support.
[19:05:38] <BtbN> If it does it anyway, the server is broken.
[19:06:10] <nospoon> I know the server ignore cient request and force the br encoding

[19:24:48] <DHE> that is a very broken HTTP server
[19:26:55] <furq> pretty sure it's technically compliant
[19:27:28] <DHE> to force content-encoding on a client?
[19:27:38] <furq> yeah it's only a SHOULD in the rfc
[19:28:05] <furq> If an Accept-Encoding header field is present in a request and none of the available representations for the response have a content-coding that is listed as acceptable, the origin server SHOULD send a response without any content-coding.
[19:28:39] <furq> or the older rfc says it should send a 406
[19:28:45] <furq> no must though
[19:28:47] <BtbN> Well, if a server ignores that, it can expect a client to not understand it
[19:28:52] <BtbN> server is broken
[19:32:11] <furq> reading the http rfcs gives you a real appreciation for how much of a miracle it is that anything works at all

[19:38:38] <nospoon> all the major browser support br if Im not misaken. it's a mater of time before most of the server start using it anyway, I hope FFmpeg get on board soon, thank you all for time
[19:40:38] <BtbN> Every proper major server will not force algorithms clients don't understand, so it's not really a huge issue for ffmpeg
[19:40:59] <BtbN> http compression really doesn't make much sense for ffmpeg, so supporting it at all is not a pressing matter
[19:41:41] <DHE> some compression can be a good thing. live streaming of some events can produce huge playlists. I've seen megabyte-size HLS playlists from youtube
[19:42:10] <BtbN> that's why live playlists typically only have the last 10 or so segments
[19:42:22] <DHE> though admittedly this was a while ago
[19:44:08] <biberao> hi is there a way to recover this file while it has a bunch of Invalid NAL unit size (-602093570 > 3800). ?
