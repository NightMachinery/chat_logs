[00:15:53] <Khepra> other distros don't "cripple" themselves either. the "server" vs "desktop" editions were only about what you get in the ISO vs what needs additional download. Debian's "netinst" is a pretty generic starter point that doesn't carry any packages and needs to download them all. it installs exactly the same Debian as the DVD or CD variants.

[00:16:35] <somiaj> babyface: the main difference between debian installs is what packages are installed. Debian doesn't provide a preset of packgaes for a 'server' since in general servers can vary way to much and server admins should be a bit more acustom to installing the tools they need
[00:17:27] <somiaj> debian will provide some preselected groups of packages for desktop users (who more often want such things) and some pure blends, but what I like about debian is being able to start with a minimial install and only install the tools I want.

[04:46:12] <sussudio> !aptitude clone
[04:46:13] <dpkg> To clone a Debian machine using aptitude (or install your favourite packages) use aptitude search --disable-columns -F%p '~i!~M!~v' > package_list; on the reference machine; xargs aptitude --schedule-only install < package_list; aptitude install; on the other machine.  This preserves information about "automatically installed" packages that other methods do not.  See also <reinstall>, <things to backup>, <debian clone>, <apt-clone>.
[04:46:46] <sussudio> reinstall doesn't take that long. just do that and copy over /home and /root and maybe some modified stuff from /ec
[04:47:25] <ede> it does. i have to rip out that disc and hope i'll be able to get the ssd in. different format ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[04:48:50] <sussudio> the dell thin client i put Piggy in already took 2.5" drives
[04:52:33] <ede> i bought an adapter with it, i just hope it fits
[04:53:18] <ede> in the good old days drive places had defined sizes, you pushed the drive in, 4 screws, done.
[04:54:01] <ede> but now everything has to be quick release, so you need some extra part, which means everything has to be "a bit" bigger, with now idea how standard this bit is.

[05:25:28] <duuude> https://fasttrack.debian.net/
[05:25:53] <sney> when a project is hosted on debian.net that means it's a work in progress and not considered production ready

[05:26:25] <ornxka> The following packages were automatically installed and are no longer required:
[05:26:36] <ornxka> and its literally just a list of every single package
[05:26:39] <sney> once fasttrack gets upgraded to debian.org mirrors, it probably still won't be enabled by default, but it'll be easier to find out that it exists
[05:26:42] <ornxka> is this some existential joke
[05:26:52] <duuude> sney: Isn't nothing vs something in favor of something?
[05:26:59] <JackFrost> Because while it's run by some DD, it's not actually run by Debian itself.
[05:27:19] <sney> ornxka: sounds like you got some big metapackages marked as automatically installed by accident
[05:27:34] <ornxka> huh
[05:27:40] <sney> if you spot the top-level packages in that list and 'apt-mark manual' them, it'll resolve
[05:28:13] <ornxka> wonder how that happened - its a proxmox machine, so im guessing its the proxmox metapackages that it happened to
[05:28:24] <sney> oh yeah, proxmox does weird stuff sometimes
[05:28:57] <sney> especially if you're using the pvetest repos
