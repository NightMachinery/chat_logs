[14:52:03] <gour> morning
[14:53:06] <gour> just watched https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlrsoIwJ-UM but i'm a bit disappointed...although my notmuch setup is not complete by any means, nm's feature of handling tags is simply terrific!

[22:53:28] <cworth> gour: Oh! That's a bit of a blast from the past. I don't think I even knew that video of that BoF session even existed.
[23:09:12] <gour> cworth: both of you were cool ðŸ˜‰
[23:15:06] <gour> tomorrow i'll get 2nd (replacement) disk for my raid1, will buy a small SSD for OS part and then after migrating back to Debian (sid), I'm going to finalize my notmuch configuration and finally migrate from mu4e...
