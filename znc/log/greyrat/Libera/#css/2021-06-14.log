[15:29:27] <Spring> Is there any way for `content` in pseudo-elements to display a unitless CSS variable? Eg: `--myvar: 50` + `content: var(--myvar)`
[15:29:39] <Spring> beside wrapping the variable in quotes, that is
[15:30:51] <Spring> I would be nice if it could be converted to a string by manipulating the `content` value with quotes but that just leads to it displaying the literal `var(--myvar)`
[15:31:02] <Spring> *it would
[15:54:26] <entuland> Spring, what is it that you want to obtain?
[15:54:36] <entuland> not _how_ you want to achieve it
[15:57:16] <Spring> entuland, ? If I have a value from a CSS variable (`--myvar`) that I'm using for something else (eg: width calculation) I'd like to use that same variable to *display* that same value visually via a pseudo element `content` property.
[15:58:24] <entuland> I got that much, but _why_?
[15:58:35] <entuland> for instance, are you after creating a counter of sorts?
[15:58:41] <entuland> cause there are facilities to do that
[15:59:00] <entuland> if your values qualify as actual page contents, you shouldn't do that via CSS
[16:00:15] <entuland> or is this some kind of debugging thing you're adding to your page to decide how to lay the stuff out?
[16:00:22] <entuland> cause if so, you should be using the inspector instead
[16:00:30] <Spring> entuland, because like I stated that value will be used for width calculation, which in my use case is for a graph representation, and also for the value of said graph line.
[16:01:14] <entuland> if you're plotting a graph you're likely using JS or generating the markup on the server side
[16:01:23] <Spring> no, I'm not
[16:01:34] <entuland> can you provide an example or a live page?
[16:01:47] <entuland> cause I still am not sure of your end goal
[16:02:33] <Spring> If I wanted to use JS I would. I was merely after a CSS only way of displaying values as strings. If that's not possible I'll just have to define one as a value and the other a string.
[16:03:00] <entuland> sorry, that's still too vague cause you're not showing your actual technique, hard to help in such a case
[16:03:13] <entuland> some things can be achieved in pure CSS but that doesn't mean it's a good idea in all cases
[16:09:40] <entuland> actually, your case _definitely_ sounds like something you shouldn't be doing in CSS
[16:10:15] <entuland> not for the actual value at least, which should be accessible in the "naked" page
[16:10:20] *** Joins: Crassus (~Crassus@user/crassus)
[16:16:53] <Spring> Here's a live example: https://jsfiddle.net/hcwjdq2r/ The figures don't need to be user selectable. I think it's clear that what I'm after isn't possible using a single value but eh, you asked for it.
[16:18:36] <entuland> well, you can use  the counter trick
[16:18:42] <entuland> but it still feels wrong to me
[16:19:22] <entuland> https://jsfiddle.net/entuland/qfeLv3bj/
[16:22:10] <Spring> entuland, much appreciated. Other non-JS alternatives to a similar use case could also be an SVG (whether via object or even img) though unless it's inline it won't inherit the page's stylesheet without JS.
[16:22:55] <Spring> since I wanted to avoid an inline SVG I wanted the markup as lean as possible for this, hence wanting to keep the re-use of the values
[16:23:58] <entuland> my main point is that unless you're handwriting your HTML / post content, you should be able to use an actual programming language to mangle the data
[16:24:10] <entuland> and at that point, you're free to duplicate the value as needed in the output
[16:24:21] <entuland> so that it can be properly selected by the end user
[16:27:54] <Spring> For this it's manually created. Would be nice if all the thousands of say, benchmark graphs across even major sites didn't use plain, static images. They could be programmatically generated, too yet vanishingly few I've ever come across are.
[16:29:28] <entuland> not sure I get that point - I'm quite positive all of those graphs are generated by a program, the difference is that it's generated server side and rendered as an image instead of using SVG / HTML+CSS or the alike
[16:29:44] <entuland> some may even generate it client side on a canvas via JS
[16:30:26] <Spring> generated into inline, non-static data, that is, yes, was about to append that
[16:31:47] <Spring> most likely in that case they found a shareable image is more important to the user
[16:32:38] <entuland> sounds like a valid reason to serve an image, yes

[23:45:39] <fkm> howdoi: Did you set a column width?
[23:46:19] <howdoi> nope, just grid-template-columns: 0.4fr 1.3fr 1.7fr; and margin of 2rem
[23:47:13] <fkm> That should be enough.
[23:48:20] <fkm> Could the image break the width? Try setting max-width:100% on the image.
[23:49:18] <fkm> If that doesn't help I'm out of ideas. Try to create a fiddle so we can look at the 'real' thing.

[23:53:18] <howdoi> fkm: `1` doesn't align with the start of the image
[23:54:56] <fkm> Vertically?
[23:55:44] <fkm> That's not a problem of the grid. Set margin:0; on the Ps and you'll be fine.
[23:58:45] <howdoi> fkm: dang! CSS reset, thanks
[23:59:43] <fkm> Anytime :-)
[23:59:46] <howdoi> fitting that img within that column is also a challenge
