[20:17:53] <omero> yes.
[20:18:26] <pussipupu> Like fiction in general and often science fiction especially it's based around thought experiments
[20:18:43] <omero> but fiction is not philosophy.
[20:19:07] <pussipupu> they are different categories but there's not no overlap
[20:19:12] <omero> and the reverse is true: philosophy is not fiction.
[20:20:15] <omero> thus, philosophy is not fiction.
[20:20:39] <omero> and viceversa
[20:23:37] <omero> one is a science. the other is purely an exerci(sz)e, a figment of immagination.

[20:30:25] <pussipupu> Philosophy is if anything a proper superset is science in the general sense
[20:31:07] <pussipupu> The socratic dialogues for instance though are often taken to be archetypal philosophy and are works of fiction
[20:31:23] <I_Am_M00t> It's like math, not empirical science, but an application of logic
[20:31:30] <pussipupu> even if they're based on real conversations which to be fair they might be
[20:31:52] <omero> I can read greek.
[20:31:56] <pussipupu> Empiricism and logic are both good and fun
[20:32:08] <pussipupu> I can read extremely basic Finnish

[20:40:43] <omero> and can we agree that I, Robot is not philosophical but rather just speculation or a figment of immagination?
[20:43:29] <omero> the cited socratic dialogues are by no means a speculation. are a proper study, detailed by a form that was popular at those times.
[20:47:09] <pussipupu> I wouldn't agree that I, Robot is completely unphilosophical certainly
[20:47:39] <pussipupu> And the idea that the dialogues are devoid of speculation is just bizarre to me from what I've read of them

[22:16:15] * omero ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[22:17:02] <omero> you got it pussipupu
[22:19:21] <pussipupu> I agree that Voltaire is more often called a philosopher than Asimov, but don't see how that's an argument for philosophy and fiction being disjoint, which still strikes me as an absurd hypothesis
[22:21:47] <omero> <which still strikes me as an absurd hypothesis> care to elaborate why, pussipupu ?
[22:22:25] <pussipupu> Also out of interest is your first language Italian?
[22:22:35] <omero> no
[22:23:30] <omero> italian is not my first language, pussipupu
[22:23:35] <pussipupu> Because any number of philosophical works, including but not limited to Plato's socratic dialogues and a huge range of thought experiments are works of fiction
[22:24:17] <pussipupu> And there's no reason philosophical ideas can't be explored in fiction in general
[22:24:47] <pussipupu> Fair enough, just wondered because of "annoverated"
[22:25:49] <pussipupu> Do you have any argument to back up the position? (or have I misinterpreted your position and you don't hold that that disjoint exists?)
[22:25:56] <omero> its just a word, I converted. tried to convey... counted didnt cut

[22:41:06] <pussipupu> I didn't avoid a question...
[22:44:16] <ikiryo> fiction can absolutely be philosophical imho, the fact that many works of asimov are used today as basis for setting grounds of understanding of different levels of automation makes it very philosophical
[22:44:45] <ikiryo> and I agree with the idea that thought experiments are philosophical fiction as well
[22:46:32] <pussipupu> Honestly I don't understand what the objection to the overlap was
[22:47:34] <omero> and you never even tryied to elaborate why, pussipupu ... from your own perspective.
[22:48:16] <pussipupu> I did elaborate, I don't understand what you mean by from my own perspective
[22:48:49] <ikiryo> I'm getting some passive-aggressive vibes from you omero
[22:49:42] <omero> ok. I will not interfere

[22:54:19] <omero> just before I go to check on my preparation of meal for the time being, may I ask one last question being: the matter of philosopy isnt the study, the codification of a line or a set of rules ?
[22:54:53] <pussipupu> I don't understand the question
[22:55:04] <ikiryo> yeah, that's the really difficult part nowadays, there's a premise of mistrust most of the time, so everyone gets offended even if there was no intention
[22:55:08] <omero> and then, isnt a work of fiction... something that eludes the confines?
[22:55:43] <pussipupu> I'm not a lexicographer but I'd say something like "the rigorous pursuit of truth and wisdom"
[22:56:12] <omero> lexicographer. interesting. it is used to order.

[22:56:19] <ikiryo> I think anything can be within philosophy, as long as you're asking why
[22:56:40] <ikiryo> the codification or set of rules are more like the grounds for logic and other philosophic tools
[22:56:45] <omero> because that is what philosophy is about, ikiryo
[22:57:15] <ikiryo> then fiction can be philosophy, if it prompts you to ask why
[22:57:16] <omero> a science that defines all other kind of sciences.
[22:58:09] <ikiryo> im not sure about that definition, epistemology is kinda the science that defines all others
[22:58:12] <omero> uhm... not properly. but philosopy encompasses evrything else. thus... yes, fiction included
