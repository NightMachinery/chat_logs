[17:06:29] <nmeum> sjamaan: is there any documentation on this profiling feature somewhere? somehow I just end up with a PROFILE file which just contains the string "statistical\n" I am missing a compilation option or something?
[17:06:56] <sjamaan> Ah, maybe you have -d0?
[17:08:18] <sjamaan> https://wiki.call-cc.org/man/5/Using the compiler has some info about it (search for "profile")
[17:08:59] <sjamaan> You can view it with "chicken-profile"
[17:09:02] <s-liao> This page does not exist yet
[17:10:01] <sjamaan> Replace spaces with %20 perhaps
[17:10:05] <sjamaan> Browsers...
[17:10:35] <s-liao> this linker https://wiki.call-cc.org/man/5/Using?
[17:11:01] <sjamaan> The link is: https://wiki.call-cc.org/man/5/Using the compiler
[17:11:39] <s-liao> same in my site.
[17:12:10] <sjamaan> And this? https://wiki.call-cc.org/man/5/Using%20the%20compiler
[17:12:27] <s-liao> This works
[17:13:13] <sjamaan> It's really stupid: spaces are not valid characters in URLs, but when you copy from the address bar (in Firefox at least), it converts %20 back to spaces
[17:13:42] <wasamasa> lol
[17:13:55] <wasamasa> I've come to prefer + over %20
[17:14:05] <sjamaan> yeah but that's officially deprecated IIRC
[17:14:24] <wasamasa> huh
[17:14:29] <sjamaan> In the HTML spec
[17:14:50] <wasamasa> I occasionally find that both are handled differently by web applications
[17:15:08] <sjamaan> yeah because the server is not required to handle those the same, IIRC
[17:15:50] <sjamaan> The HTML spec says something about + being spaces, but the URI spec doesn't
[17:16:16] <sjamaan> It's like the & and = for query strings
[17:16:22] <sjamaan> That's not part of the URI spec either
[17:16:29] <wasamasa> oh right
[17:16:31] <wasamasa> what an awful mess
[17:16:34] <sjamaan> yup
[17:17:58] <wasamasa> and there's a URL living standard to top it off
[17:18:37] <wasamasa> I quickly looked over it and found a provision for a flag to toggle how a space is encoded, defaulting to %20
[17:18:47] <wasamasa> but then, there's this goodie
[17:18:48] <wasamasa> > URLSearchParams objects will percent-encode anything in the application/x-www-form-urlencoded percent-encode set, and will encode U+0020 SPACE as U+002B (+).
[17:19:18] <wasamasa> but that seems to be part of a JS API??
[17:19:25] <sjamaan> heh
[17:19:35] <sjamaan> They have no idea what they're doing
[17:45:35] <nmeum> sjamaan: with -debug-info and (linkage static) and I seem to be able to generate a PROFILE which contains actual information but for some reason it is very short and differes for each run of the software I would expect each PROFILE to contain the same procedure invocations https://tpaste.us/MzxD
[17:45:47] <nmeum> maybe PROFILE generation is racy for some reason?
[17:47:22] <nmeum> or might it be an issue that I am using the R7RS egg and not R5RS?
[17:54:37] <sjamaan> nmeum: -:p is statistical profiling, it takes a snapshot of the call chain at a certain frequency
[17:55:09] <sjamaan> If you want a more deterministic profiler, try compiling your code with -profile
[17:55:27] <sjamaan> But there the act of profiling itself changes the runtime performance of the program
[17:55:42] <sjamaan> (that one works by instrumenting each procedure with profiling info)
[17:57:29] <sjamaan> With -:P you can increase the sampling frequency
[17:57:59] <sjamaan> Actually, decrease that number, as it is how long to wait between samples

[22:33:49] <mononote> at the beginning of (chicken foreign) it is stated that
[22:33:58] <mononote> > Note that this interface is source-based, since CHICKEN translates Scheme code to C. It is not binary, as in many other Scheme implementations.
[22:34:13] <mononote> what does it mean?
[22:36:26] <Corbin> I think it means that CHICKEN asks a C compiler to compile everything together at the level of C source, rather than e.g. invoking libffi at runtime.
[22:36:44] <wasamasa> I'd rather call them compile-time and runtime
[22:37:16] <mononote> so ..
[22:37:36] <mononote> if I were to make binding to some C functions
[22:38:08] <mononote> could I compile a module and then use the functions from csi?
[22:38:17] <wasamasa> you need to load it from csi
[22:38:21] <wasamasa> and then you can use them, yes
[22:38:35] <mononote> that is neat, thanks
