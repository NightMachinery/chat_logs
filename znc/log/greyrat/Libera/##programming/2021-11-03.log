[05:37:19] <arahael> norias: Then it's the frame rate you're more worried about, not the resolution.

[05:38:55] <nisstyre> you should be able to do that with any old video editing software, the trick is getting the video in the first place
[05:38:59] <norias> to interpret what was mechanically occuring with the sounds
[05:39:02] <nisstyre> which requires a high speed camera
[05:39:53] <nisstyre> then you just take say 1000 frames or whatever and you can show them at a slower speed
[05:40:07] <norias> yeah
[05:40:08] <oldlaptop> There are high-speed cameras under US$10k nowadays, apparently
[05:40:16] <oldlaptop> which is *really cheap* for a high-speed camera

[12:26:56] <mrig> I think much of the windows graphics layer is still using 32 bit.
[12:27:19] <deniska> mrig: win32 is 64 bit libs, 32 bit libs are called WoW64 :)
[12:27:24] <d3x0r> I think some of it (like system32) is just becaues of legacy reasons and no real rason to hange it
[12:27:28] <vdamewood> mrig: Not really. Microsoft just kept a bunch of stuff labeled '32' for backwards compatibility with badly written software.
[12:27:39] <mrig> vdamewood It seems to use a lot of 32 bit values, for SIMD though I presume, rather than any requirement.
[12:27:40] <vdamewood> ^ what d3x0r said.
[12:27:42] <pyzozord> ah so x68-64 cpu can run 32 bit code, but 32 bit code cannot interface with 64 bit code?
[12:27:42] <deniska> pyzozord: to run 32 bit software you need 32 bit libs
[12:28:05] <vdamewood> mrig: Well, what is anyone using SIMD for, and do they even need 64-bit values for that stuff?
[12:28:05] <deniska> pyzozord: making 64 builds of wine run 32 bit windows software would be a fairly signigicant effort
[12:28:34] <amigojapan> vdamewood: mainframes running COBOL still exist, why not keep it 32 bit systems running, I don't get it

[12:28:46] <mrig> vdamewood well yes, this is the graphical interface, and it is for faster blitting I presume.
[12:29:11] <vdamewood> mrig: Yep. And 'True Color' displays only need 24-bits (32-bits with alpha).
[12:29:18] <mrig> no idea though really, am just speculating

[12:30:28] <mrig> for aesthetic calculation.
[12:30:29] <pyzozord> ah so the main reason the 32 bit code cannot interface with 64 bit code is because the 32 bit code was likely written before 64 bit code existed

[12:33:30] <deniska> but I mean, is it theoretically possible to trampoline a call from 32 bit binary to a 64 bit lib? Wine does something along the lines for 16 bit apps

[12:37:00] <d3x0r> only at a process level
[12:37:13] <arahael> deniska: Yes, windows had a set of thunks it could use for that.  Limited to *16* bits.
[12:37:17] <deniska> so different processes observe the cpu in different modes?
[12:37:18] <vdamewood> deniska: I *think* the OS will drop into protected mode for a 32-bit process, but otherwise that's all it does.
[12:37:55] <vdamewood> deniska: It's basically just protected vs long mode (32-bit vs 64-bit). But yes.
[12:39:03] <vdamewood> deniska: So, if you have a 32-bit app running, it's running in protected mode, and a 64-bit app runs in long mode. And the kernel handles switching between the two. Usually they kernel only switches when the process starts, (and when task switching).

[15:21:01] <alycidyne> Ideally, every conversion is actually a function simply taking an argument of one type and returning a value of another type, so conversions are IMO not even a valid subject in their own right
[15:21:33] <d3x0r> right - and JS can inspect the arguments and generate different outputs but it's the functions that are 'polymorphic'  not types
[15:21:58] <DnzAtWrk> I mean

[15:22:11] <alycidyne> Also, note I explicitly said parametric/ad-hoc polymorphism

[17:11:09] <beaky> at last after a week of puzzling over the problem i have finally managed to define a circular linked list in agda but it is not complete yet i must prove it correct using coinduction https://bpa.st/OITQ

[17:12:06] <beaky> this is the advantage of using agda the termination checker can always check that the circular linked list is always guarded

[17:12:50] <[itchyjunk]> ah i see
[17:13:03] <[itchyjunk]> weird data structure.
[17:13:04] <beaky> a linked list is a data structure consisting of nodes where each node has an element and links to other nodes
[17:13:06] <[itchyjunk]> Never came across it
[17:13:26] <beaky> a singly linked list has one link, and doubly linked lists have links to a 'previous' and 'next' node
[17:13:32] <hans> sounds like a html DOMElement
[17:13:42] <[itchyjunk]> make me think of tables with common id or something
[17:13:49] <[itchyjunk]> two tables are linked via the common column
[17:14:00] <[itchyjunk]> that's kinda of a simialr idea right? or am i wrong there?

[17:19:16] <d3x0r> they're not usually as circular as the name might imply

[17:22:46] <beaky> yes plain circular linked list dont really show up a lot, circular buffers (which are more like arrays not linked lists) show up a lot as queues used to implement any sort of buffering for processing data and stuff, circular linked lists are just an example of cyclical data structures which do show up a lot in certain data models, where its usually something to be avoided but you end up with
[17:22:48] <beaky> anyway when you have some data you want to navigate through but want a 'parent' link so you can go backwards, for example like the aforementioned DOMElement
[17:23:05] <beaky> i think it shows up in lock free data structures
[17:24:14] <[itchyjunk]> Never heard of DOMElement
[17:24:18] <beaky> cyclic lists might be a better name but 'cycle' happens in even the non-circular doubly-linked list
[17:24:22] <[itchyjunk]> i guess i should pay more attention to data structures
[17:24:39] <[itchyjunk]> too bad i won't get to take the data structures and algorithms class next semester
[17:25:02] <beaky> the DOM is the document object model which is the central api for frontend web programming
[17:25:29] <[itchyjunk]> hmm
[17:25:40] <d3x0r> a task queue is really sort of circular... when you get to the end you just go the start - and depending on the priority of a task you can easily add at the start of end of the ring
[17:25:43] <[itchyjunk]> i might have heard of it wrt js but still not really sure what it is
[17:25:47] <d3x0r> which at some point the end is really just the start
[17:26:40] <d3x0r> I guess that's a round-robin schedule is circular
[17:26:42] <[itchyjunk]> what's an easy example? open fridge , look in, close fridge  linked back to open fridge?
[17:26:44] <beaky> queues show up a lot in programming especially in our async world where we must receive tasks, process them, and receive the results, all in a differnet nondeterministic order
[17:27:05] <d3x0r> explorer, chrome, taskmanager, idle, (explorer,....)

[18:52:25] <sonny> why not use the heap?
[18:52:35] <sonny> I don't ever want a stack to be complicated
[18:52:36] <Soni> because stack is lock-free
[18:52:48] <sonny> you can make a stack on the heap
[18:52:50] <d3x0r> so are thread local heaps
[18:53:19] <Soni> why not just have "infinite" stack?
[18:53:23] <Soni> the address space supports it
[18:53:27] <d3x0r> because reasons.
[18:53:46] <sonny> probably historical
[18:53:48] <Soni> what's the point of 64-bit if you're not gonna use it
[18:54:08] <d3x0r> no, but seiously - paging for the stack I'd imagine is prioritized differently since it's much more frequently used
[18:54:17] <sonny> iirc you can change the stack size?
[18:54:29] <Soni> overcommit is a thing anyway
[18:54:45] <sonny> [itchyjunk]: not worth looking into unless you are into os stuff imo

[20:34:23] <whatsupdoc> What do you mean by 'combination'?
[20:34:24] <d3x0r> or by hash really if you have a password you don't know but have the hash
[20:34:27] <whatsupdoc> A password?
[20:34:34] <d3x0r> ya some combination of bytes
[20:34:43] <GeDaMo> Usually passwords based on dictionary words
[20:34:45] <whatsupdoc> Is it part of a password then?
[20:34:56] <whatsupdoc> What is the advantage of that?
[20:35:11] <GeDaMo> It's a reverse lookup from password hash to password
[20:35:12] <whatsupdoc> Can't you just run it through a hash function and get an answer?
[20:35:13] <d3x0r> it takes time to do the hash while you can index the other and look it up very quickly
[20:35:25] <d3x0r> not when you just have the hash
[20:35:39] <[itchyjunk]> i've made rainbow tables before

[20:35:58] <[itchyjunk]> then all random 6 letter wrods into hash too

[20:37:16] <whatsupdoc> someone had to create the table, i guess if you use someone's premade table, it saves the work
[20:37:18] <whatsupdoc> thanks
[20:37:40] <[itchyjunk]> you can make your own table.
[20:37:52] <[itchyjunk]> you cann downlaod "common used passwords" dictionary for example
[20:38:00] <[itchyjunk]> and turn that into rainbow table
[20:38:19] <[itchyjunk]> because people tend to reuse password, passwords that were stored using some weaker algo long time ago
