[15:54:12] <Ingvix> hey, a beginner here trying to edit existing code and clojure is scary. I got a for loop where a similar thing is created multiple times. What would be the best way to run a function with each nth and nth+1 of the created things as an argument? I'm still a bit unsure about where and how should I store things with clojure
[15:56:55] <Ingvix> I was wondering if I should save the things to a list and after the for loop iterate over it or should I just save the previous thing somewhere on the next iteration of the for loop run the function
[15:58:00] <lunik1> if I get your meaning https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/partition might help
[15:59:32] *** Joins: sandra (~snan@chicken/contributor/snan)
[16:00:46] <lunik1> so you have (thing1 thing2 thing3 thing4 ...), use partition to make that ((thing 1 thing2) (thing 2 thing3) (thing 3 thing4) ...)
[16:01:09] <lunik1> then use map to map your function onto that sequence of pairs
[16:02:41] <Ingvix> so I should first save them to a list?
[16:02:44] <ridcully_> and as it might sound intimidating for beginners: `for` is not a loop like you might be familiar from imperative languages.  it's a "list comprehension"
[16:02:55] <Ingvix> oh
[16:03:03] <Ingvix> interesting
[16:04:05] *** Joins: DasBrain (DasBrain@user/dasbrain)
[16:04:10] <lunik1> Ingvix: you'd have the sequence as an intermediate step, but it maybe produced/consumed lazily
[16:05:29] <Ingvix> uhh, I might require a bit more layman's terms here
[16:07:03] <ridcully_> if you can share your actual problem, we might be better able to help.  but i'd like to second, that `partition` sounds like what you want
[16:07:18] <lunik1> so in clojure (and this is generally a big point of functional programming languages) you have the concept of laziness: calculations are only performed once their result is needed
[16:07:41] <ridcully_> e.g. try `(partition 2 1 (range 3))` in your repl.  this gives you the pairs of neighbours.
[16:08:13] <lunik1> in contrast to other languages which are eager - the calculation is performed where it is specified, whether the result is ever needed or not
[16:08:35] <Ingvix> first of all does that 'for' statement produce a list? I'm not quite sure what "list comprehension" means
[16:09:16] <ridcully_> correct.  for creates a (lazy) list
[16:09:28] <lunik1> partition's docstring tells you that it generates a lazy sequence, so the nth term, so the nth term is only created once you actually access it*, so the entire sequence is not created all at once
[16:09:29] <Ingvix> ah, I see
[16:09:34] <sandra> A "lazy sequence" rather than a vector
[16:09:47] <lunik1> *the implementation is a bit more subtle than this
[16:09:49] <Ingvix> I'm starting to get this, I think
[16:10:12] <Ingvix> partition the for statement and map things to a function from there
[16:11:55] <lunik1> 👍
[16:12:12] <Ingvix> alright, I shall try, thanks
[16:12:28] <lunik1> clojure is all about composing your operations like that

[16:44:45] <sjamaan> Hi! I'm trying to figure out how to quote SQL strings and identifiers using jdbc, but for the life of me can't find out how to do it.  as-sql-name seems to be a clue but what's this "entities" argument it wants?
[16:50:23] <sandra> sjamaan: the entities argument defaults to identity and an alternative utility function, jdbc/quoted, is provided. Or you can user your own li'l lambda there
[16:50:57] <sandra> I mean, the quoted takes a char as input and generates a function
[16:51:12] <sjamaan> But "quoted" also wants me to know the syntax to use and it doesn't "feel" very safe
[16:51:27] <sjamaan> And defaulting to "identity" seems like a huge footgun waiting to be set off
[16:51:45] <sandra> Oh, I'm not trying to defend the design here
[16:53:21] <sandra> But this is how it works: you pass in strings as values, and by default they're inserted into the SQL as the strings they are (identity).
[16:53:21] <sandra> With entities you can pass another transformer in. The jdbc/quoted generates such transformers by taking delimiters as args
[16:54:08] <sandra> But you can write any old transformer
[16:54:41] <sandra> (I don't have my nix REPL up because I'm constantly rebooting this machine as I struggle with the ISP stuff)
[16:56:48] <sandra> Play around with ((jdbc/quoted \[ \]) "my test string") or whatever in the REPL to see what it does
[16:57:09] <sjamaan> Yeah but the point is that I want to defer to the driver to do this for me
[16:57:18] <sjamaan> Doing it manual is error-prone and dangerous
[16:57:40] <sandra> Right. It also takes keyword arguments for a specific stropper, like :mysql or :sqlserver
[16:57:40] <sjamaan> The driver also knows to translate question marks into $1, $2 etc, for example
[16:57:56] <sandra> I didn't find one for PostgreSQL
[16:58:25] <sjamaan> Scary
[16:58:44] <sjamaan> It uses ansi escape syntax though
[17:00:12] <sandra> In that case put {:entities :ansi}
[17:01:43] <sjamaan> Thanks sandra 
[17:02:26] <sandra> ♥
[17:02:48] <sjamaan> Those docs really threw me for a loop
[17:03:19] <sandra> Yeah, I can see that
[17:03:29] <sandra> I mean, see how they would throw someone for a loop, I meant
[17:05:16] <sandra> sjamaan: aaaah hold on! It should be {:entities (jdbc/quoted :ansi)} OK? Got that?
[17:05:41] <sandra> The quoted utility function is where the dispatch-on-message takes placee, not in the entities-keyword-parser
[17:05:52] <sjamaan> I'm just using quoted directly
[17:06:09] <sjamaan> as-sql-name is only useful if you have a possibly table-prefixed identifier
[17:07:29] <sandra> Yes
[17:11:10] <sandra> Right, but I accidentally told you to put {:entities :ansi} instead of {:entities (jdbc/quoted :ansi)}
[17:11:59] <sjamaan> That would probably result in hilarious errors
[17:12:53] <sandra> Putting a keyword in car position is a special magic in Clojure ♥
[17:14:23] <sjamaan> yeah so it'll shamelessly return nil when passed a string
[17:14:32] <sandra> Hahahaha
[17:14:36] <sjamaan> That's the worst
[17:14:51] <sjamaan> nonsense in, nil out
[17:15:18] <sandra> Good luck with that ORM you're writing♥

[21:25:47] <Para> One of the big reasons I don't really contribute to FOSS is that as consultant I sometimes have quite exotic/high interest email domains.
[21:25:55] <Para> This is a blessing and a curse.

[21:33:58] <sandra> I recently found out that you can set your git email on a per directory basis
[21:34:17] <sandra> My first couple of commits at work are from my own email before I figured this out
[21:34:51] <Para> Yep.
[21:35:05] <Para> The slightly harder trick is to tell git that you don't have a global/default address :)
[21:35:12] <sandra> Right
[21:35:35] <Para> This prompts git to ask for valid email on first commit. I use it all the time, for aforementioned reason of having multiple email identities due to customer work.
[21:35:51] <sandra> I wouldn't mind using my global address for my work commits, but, I sometimes like to make small edits+MRs using gitlab's web edit UI and those would be the work account either way so might as well be consistent
[21:36:09] <Para> GitLab's Web IDE is surprisingly functional.
[21:36:31] <sandra> Especially for like changing a word in a README and such
[21:36:58] <technomancy> how is it possible for gitlab to build a functioning web IDE when they can't even build a working comment form
[21:37:40] <sandra> Whaddayamean, technomancy?
[21:37:49] <Para> something something microservices
[21:38:05] <sandra> ew
[21:38:16] <Para> GitLab has this wonderful aspect that a lot of the feature "islands" have wildly varying quality.
[21:38:19] <technomancy> sandra: when I type in the gitlab comment textarea there's like a two-second lag before the text shows up
[21:38:43] <sandra> Oh, that sounds awful!
[21:39:04] <Para> One of my colleagues debugged that issue some time ago. Hmm, what was it...
[21:39:10] <technomancy> luckily they let you reply to comments over email or I would just not contribute to any projects on gitlab ever
[21:39:27] <Para> He had it as well, and he was the team's only Linux user so that narrowed it down. Just can't remember the solution at all, if there even was one.
[21:39:42] <sandra> I haven't experienced the same problem
[21:39:56] <technomancy> Para: I think the suggested solution is like "don't use firefox" but I prefer "don't use gitlab"
[21:40:04] <sandra> ♥
[21:40:11] <Para> I only use Firefox on multiple platforms and it works for me so yeah, who knows.
[21:40:21] <Para> (well OK, I also use Edge whenever Firefox fails)
[21:40:52] <Para> But GitLab, ah yes.
[21:41:06] <Para> Who creates a CI which actively fights against doing commits back to the repo.
[21:41:33] <technomancy> also I like how gitlab is trying to get me to set up a kubernetes deploy for my emacs lisp library
[21:41:35] <Para> shallow checkout without remotes set, hrngh
[21:41:45] <technomancy> it's like ... read the room, gitlab
[21:41:53] <sandra> hahaha
[21:42:02] <technomancy> but I guess anything which chips away at the MS monopoly can't be all bad
[21:42:24] <sandra> Pretty much the only room where it's OK to pitch kubernetes is a completely empty one
[21:42:25] <Para> There's some quiet murmurs that Azure DevOps is probably DOA :)
[21:42:37] <Para> The git/build part of it, anyways.
[21:42:53] <Para> Turns out GitHub with its Actions and existing integrations and workflows was a pretty good purchase for MS.
[21:43:01] *** Quits: xsperry (~as@user/xsperry) ()
[21:43:34] <Para> Azure DevOps as project ticket management tool beats Jira easily though.
[21:44:10] <Para> Which brings me back to GitLab. I just don't understand the logic of its boards and tickets. I assume I just don't know how to use them but they don't feel easy/logical.
[21:44:32] <Para> Of course locking random features to higher cost tiers is a thing as well. Like the namespaced tags.
[21:44:55] <Para> Can't do env:dev/env:stage/env:prod tag to an issue for example if I don't pay enough!

[22:00:17] <technomancy> holy shit they're just *now* turning off unencrypted git:// ?
[22:01:59] <technomancy> didn't they do a thing recently where they default to giving you commands that use their client instead of regular repo URLs?
[22:02:53] <sandra> That 
[22:03:07] <sandra> That mighta been an a/b thing because I never saw it. OTOH I never look at github so never mind
