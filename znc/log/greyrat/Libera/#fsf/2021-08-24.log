[05:35:51] <jxself> In a world where the free software movement won, all software everywhere was free, and no one ever made proprietary software then in that hypothetical world maybe an argument could be made that copyleft isn't needed and could be safely retired.

[06:49:41] <opal> i mean once bsd/isc code is released, cat's out of the bag
[06:49:55] <opal> sure someone can fork it and use the fork internally but they cant un-release someone else's work
[06:49:56] <opal> thats how i see it

[06:50:44] <opal> for me its less confusing to see my rights in less than an 80x24 page than to remember what i can do for a specific gpl version
[06:50:44] <KittyOwO[m]> The issue with that is if someone else modifies it I won't be guarunteed to be able to modify nor audit the modifications that, say, a large company released out with massive improvements.
[06:51:00] <opal> and on top of that the gpl is often "misused" for people who think it provides additional protections that it never promised
[06:51:05] <opal> so it can get confusing there too
[06:51:30] <opal> meh big enough companies will always find ways around it to avoid releasing features
[06:51:55] <opal> there are just as many corps releasing back regardless of licence because they do see some benefit to it
[06:51:58] <opal> peer review for example
[06:52:12] <KittyOwO[m]> I am not familiar with the "misused" problem but I do agree having minimal things is nice. Would be kinda nice to have a copyleft license that is minimal and with good compatibility.

[06:53:19] <DiffieHellman> If just 1 company releases their improvements due to the GPL, then the GPL has won.
[06:53:21] <KittyOwO[m]> just something for small programs ect. that are usually released under non-copyleft licenses would be nice to have a minimal license for. Maybe something that basically just says its a strong/weak copyleft and can be replaced by the gpl at any time
[06:53:41] <opal> i dont like how heavy-handed the gpl is
[06:53:52] <opal> i want people to release improvements because they understand the benefit
[06:53:53] <DiffieHellman> grsec violated the GPL by attempting to place additional restrictions on their patches.
[06:53:55] <opal> not because they were told to
[06:54:26] <DiffieHellman> With the GPL, people are free to release improvements if they understand the benefit.
[06:54:43] <KittyOwO[m]> ^ copyleft is still free licenses, you can do whatever with them
[06:55:12] <DiffieHellman> The GPL does not _tell_ you to release, as you're free to keep your improvements to yourself, but if you are releasing, you must meet the GPLs requirements

[07:06:13] <DiffieHellman> There's also a lot of bugs, as no programmer is perfect, but those are slowly being fixed as time goes on,

[07:48:49] <KittyOwO[m]> DiffieHellman: starwars music begins to play
[07:50:28] <DiffieHellman> - for stdin is a de-facto standard I'm pretty sure. The empty args list for stdin is another de-facto standard that isn't always implemented

[19:34:54] <Frogging101> PHP's not too hard to deploy, fortunately. There are more annoying stacks to have around
[19:35:09] <Frogging101> usually those go into containers if I use them at all. can't be bothered
[19:35:28] <opal> well i dont even run nginx
[19:35:30] <opal> just publicfile
[19:35:45] <opal> i have stunnel in front so i could just set up a new vhost for that i guess
[19:35:46] <opal> point that to nginx or something
[19:35:52] <opal> or just hack together a cgi setup
[19:35:53] <opal> dunno
