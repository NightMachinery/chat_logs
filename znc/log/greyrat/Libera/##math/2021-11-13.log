[00:58:15] <int-e> The thing is, when you construct a new object in math, you shouldn't have any expectations for it. I mean, you may have properties in mind that the new object should have to be useful, but you have to prove those properties rather than hope for them to work out as you envisioned.

[01:33:59] <greenbagels> but now i understand that it just kind of comes up in the context of analysis and topology and other things
[01:34:45] *** Parts: varde (~androirc@82-132-215-191.dab.02.net) ()
[01:35:47] <[itchyjunk]> you need to learn truth table in discrete math class
[01:36:02] <[itchyjunk]> and set theory is introduced in analysis and topology class a little
[01:36:05] <greenbagels> sorry i meant like ordinals, cardinals, etc.
[01:36:08] <[itchyjunk]> even in algebra
[01:36:10] <greenbagels> non-naive set theory
[01:36:20] <[itchyjunk]> oh yeah, only place ive seen ordinals so far is my history of math class
[01:36:26] <[itchyjunk]> too bad i am missing most of the lectures now
[01:36:46] <[itchyjunk]> i still haven't worked out how i get my ideals are finitely generated btw
[01:36:49] <mycroftiv> i dont think people learn it unless they go into logic/set theory specifically, this is why nobody knows what the heck a measurable cardinal really is around here, honestly
[01:36:59] <[itchyjunk]> if someone is in the mood to spoon feed me the last bit :D
[01:37:01] <Z-module> My favorite use of ordinals in algebra is the the Ulm classification of all countable abelian p-groups.
[01:37:14] <[itchyjunk]> measurable from measure theory?
[01:37:29] <[itchyjunk]> measure theory only shows up in real analysis class and i didn't get a chance to take it
[01:38:07] <mycroftiv> itchyjunk: very related historically but not actually that exact thing, measurable cardinals and cohen forcing are the two 1960s era major jumping off points for modern set theory

[02:06:06] <Z-module> mycroftiv: I've been working my way through Laszlo Fuchs's classic 2-volume "Infinite Abelian Groups" -- chock-full of neat results ~no one has ever heard of. I like this one: If A is any abelian group at all, it has an omega-chain B_1 <= B_2 <= B_3 <= ...  of subgroups whose union is A, where every B_n is some direct sum of cyclic groups.  For example if A is Q, we can use B_n = <1/n!> -- each B_n is =~ Z. But the result is for *every*
[02:06:06] <Z-module> abelian group.
[02:08:58] <mycroftiv> that is cool indeed, is finding those subgroups always possible constructively or will sometimes they exist but cant be specified?
[02:09:27] <Z-module> I believe that one is non-constructive.
[02:09:52] <mycroftiv> powerful existence theorems like that over a big set of objects usually are classically

[02:12:24] <Z-module> so for R (the reals), we can elaborate the above. Let {s_r : r in R} be some Hamel basis of R over Q (a set of size |R|, of course), and now let  B_n = SUM_{r in R} <s_r / n!>   -- so each B_n now is a direct sum of |R| many infinite cyclics.

[02:14:29] <Z-module> and you can use them for *so* many fun/wacky examples, like a partition of (0, +infty) into two nonempty sets each closed under addition.
[02:14:41] <Z-module> (also non-constructive necessarily)
[02:15:25] <Z-module> compare to the triviality of partitioning the full set R into two sets each closed under addition
[02:17:28] <mycroftiv> hmm i just found a claim that some hamel basis is actually lebesgue measurable in https://www.imsc.res.in/~sunder/mgnvss.pdf based on cantor set
[02:17:57] <Z-module> oh, maybe I'm misremembering, but any Hamel basis can be used to constructively create a non-measurable set, I think'
[02:19:21] <mycroftiv> i think the most usual case would be non-measurable and a hamel basis cant contain any set of positive lebesgue measure (just quoting this paper for the last)
[02:19:30] <Z-module> (watch out in general literature: some use "Hamel basis" only to mean a basis of R over Q, while others use it in any real or complex normed space to mean a basis in the pure linear algebra sense, to distinguish from a Schauder basis)

[03:49:22] <learner36> only the reverse version (coYoneda lemma) F[Fn,??]==>(F[?,??],Fn)

[05:09:20] <isekaijin> Franciman: I think the best way to get an appreciation for Yoneda's lemma is with a concrete example of why it is awesome. Taken at face value, Yoneda just says that an object in a category C is determined up to isomorphism by how other objects in C map to it. That is, we can recover the isomorphism class of X \in C from the natural isomorphism class of the contravariant functor Hom(-,X) : C^op ->
[05:09:22] <isekaijin> Set.
[05:09:51] <isekaijin> Franciman: But, in the category of algebraic varieties, we have something even better: an algebraic variety X is determined up to isomorphism by how *affine* varieties map to it, which is a contravariant functor AffVar^op -> Set, i.e., a *co*variant functor k-CommAlg -> Set.

[06:56:32] <[itchyjunk]> yes, for each m, why do we get an ideal J_m in R?
[06:56:51] <[itchyjunk]> they pick some arbitrary ideal I in R[x] and using the leading coeff of poly in I they make J
[06:57:22] <isekaijin> Fulton is explicitly constructing the ideals J_m.
[06:57:25] <[itchyjunk]> but now for each poly F_i in I, they manage to get an ideal in J
[06:57:31] <[itchyjunk]> hmm
[06:59:16] <isekaijin> He does not say “hence there exists an ideal J_m such that <property>”, but rather “let J_m be <explicit construction>”.
[06:59:44] <isekaijin> So perhaps you are unsatisfied with how J_m is constructed?
[07:00:04] *** Joins: twoisprime (~twoisprim@user/twoisprime)
[07:00:41] <isekaijin> In all fairness, he only defines J_m as a subset of R, and he assumes that it is obvious to you why this set is an ideal of R.
[07:01:05] <Z-module> Once you believe that J (*all* the leading coeffs. of things in I, along with 0) is an ideal of R, then for each fixed m, taking J_m = just the things in J that come from polys of I with degree <= m  gives a certain subset of J. You can check now that this J_m is also an ideal of R.
[07:01:34] <Z-module> you only need to check that it's an additive subgroup of J, and that it's closed under multiplication by anything in R.
[07:02:12] <[itchyjunk]> I verified that J is infact ideal
[07:02:24] <isekaijin> Okay, now you need to do the same for the J_m's.
[07:02:35] <[itchyjunk]> ahh he's hand waving the J_m being ideal part? okay i thought it was supposed to see why it is already
[07:02:45] <isekaijin> He is not handwaving it.

[07:02:58] <[itchyjunk]> okay, i'll take it at his word for now and go back and prove it after i grasp the rest of the proof
[07:03:05] <Z-module> this is very very common in proofs
[07:03:05] <[itchyjunk]> ahh :(
[07:03:13] <isekaijin> He is omitting the proof that J_m is an ideal, because he assumes that it is obvious, and if he added the explicit proof, then the overall proof would become longer for no reason.

[07:05:02] <isekaijin> At my university, this is the last course in the undergraduate algebra sequence, and it is one of the hardest undergraduate courses. So do not feel bad if you do not get everything immediately.
[07:07:00] <Z-module> This might help you when you come back to that part, just for clarity:  Let's define subsets I_m of I in just the same way:  I_m = {all polys of I having degree <= m}. You will find that each I_m is an additive subgroup of I, but NOT an ideal in R[X].   But J_m being just the leading coeffs of the things in J_m works more nicely, and *is* an ideal of R, because multiplying by general things from R (constants in R[X]) is much more
[07:07:00] <Z-module> restricted that multiplying by things from R[X].
[07:07:36] <Z-module> sorry, J_m being leading coeffs of things in I_m

[07:12:13] <Z-module> I see your issue, [itchyjunk]: He did write  "Let J_m be the ideal ..."   and you thought that somehow already assumed a claim somewhere that that truly is an ideal. It's an implicit assertion that it is, with proof omitted.
[07:12:27] <isekaijin> [itchyjunk]: Okay, so let a, b \in J_m. Then there exists polynomials f, g \in I_m whose leading coefficients are a and b, respectively. The first thing you need to show is that a + b is also the leading coefficient of a polynomial in I_m. Notice that, if f and g have the same degree, then a + b is the leading coefficient of f + g. But what if f and g do not have the same degree?
[07:12:50] <[itchyjunk]> Z-module, he also didn't do J cup {0} which threw me off when trying to show J is ideal

[07:13:16] <Z-module> yes, I can't tell if he simply forgot to mention 0, or assumed we just throw it in automatically as a trivial matter
[07:13:41] <Z-module> or maybe he considers 0 to be the "leading coefficient" of the 0 polynomial. But it's a trivial matter.
[07:14:16] <[itchyjunk]> isekaijin, this is the same trick as showing J right? i take difference of k and l of x^k and x^l and multiply second by x^(k-l) assuming l < k
[07:14:25] <isekaijin> Yes.
[07:15:16] <isekaijin> Notice that, after doing this, the new f and g still now have the greatest of the degrees of the original f and g. And this degree is still <= m.
[07:15:18] <Z-module> Filling in "trivial holes" ends up being a big task for some published proofs. I had a situation recently where, for 4 days in a row, I couldn't fill one in and I was beginning the think the author was bonkers. Then I realized what dump assumption I'd made about something he defined earlier, and once I fixed that, it was all easy.

[07:24:59] <[itchyjunk]> i think i don't understand I'
[07:25:14] <isekaijin> I mean, there are not many fundamentally different ways to prove Hilbert's basis theorem.
[07:25:16] <[itchyjunk]> if all the F_i's are generating the ideal, shouldn't it arealdy be I
[07:25:20] <Z-module> Anyway, when showing some ideal is finitely generated, you can take as many liberties you want in specifying a finite generating set, it can be much larger than really needed, etc. As long as it's still finite, you're good.
[07:27:04] <Z-module> the F_i's don't already generate something useful in R[X].  They're merely certain polys whose leading coeffs generate J in R.
[07:27:35] <Z-module> It might be clearer to always say  R-ideal  or  R[X]-ideal   (whichever is the case) everywhere in this proof.
[07:32:24] <[itchyjunk]> if deg(G) > N, why can we find such Qi's?
[07:33:12] <isekaijin> The basic idea is this: Suppose there were an infinite ascending chain of ideals in R[x]. Then there is a sequence of polynomials f_0, f_1, f_2, etc., such that none of the f_n is generated by f_0, ..., f_{n-1}. We may further assume that each f_n has minimal degree among the polynomials not generated by f_0, ..., f_{n-1}. (Because the degrees are natural numbers. Use the well-ordering principle.)
[07:33:30] <[itchyjunk]> oh nm, i think i understand. just multiply by G-largest power of F_i
[07:34:49] <[itchyjunk]> right, each f_n has a minimal degree poly poly not generated by any of the lower n
[07:35:13] *** Joins: KillAnimals (~anon@24.244.23.150)
[07:36:16] <isekaijin> Now let a_n be the leading coefficient of f_n. Since the a_n are in R, and R is Noetherian, eventually some a_n is generated by a_0, ..., a_{n-1}. Write this linear combination a_n = u_0 a_0 + ... + u_{n-1} a_{n-1}. Then you can easily construct another element g \in R[x] that has the same leading coefficient as f_n, but *is* generated by f_0, ..., f_{n-1}. Hence g - f_n is not generated by f_0,

[07:37:32] <isekaijin> It is easier to work with elements directly. At some point you need to learn to work with ideals rather than elements, but that moment does not have to be right now.

[07:38:21] <isekaijin> Errr, I should have said “another element g \in R[x] that has the same degree and leadining coefficient as f_n”.
[07:38:30] <isekaijin> ffs leading*
[07:40:45] <isekaijin> While I was trying to be as explicit as possible, I sadly still omitted an important detail: the polynomials f_0, f_1, f_2, ... have increasing degrees. This follows from the assumption that each f_n has minimal degree among the polynomials not generated by f_0, ..., f_{n-1}.
[07:43:11] <[itchyjunk]> so i assume I' is smaller then I. so there is some smallest poly in I not in I' by the leading coeff of it has to be in J but since J is noetherian it has a generator so that coeff can be generated by generator of J and that thing is in I'
[07:43:22] <[itchyjunk]> Hence g - f_n is not generated by f_0,
[07:43:22] <[itchyjunk]> <isekaijin> ..., f_{n-1}, and has degree strictly less than f_n,
[07:43:30] <[itchyjunk]> not sure i understood this bit
[07:43:50] <isekaijin> [itchyjunk]: g and f_n have the same degree and leading coefficient.
[07:44:11] <isekaijin> f_n = a_n x^d + lower terms and g = a_n x^d + lower terms
[07:44:25] <isekaijin> When you subtract them, the leading terms cancel each other, and you get something that only has lower terms.
[07:46:27] <isekaijin> Now, g is explicitly constructed as an R-linear combination of f_0, ..., f_{n-1}. If g - f_n were also an R-linear combination of f_0, ..., f_{n-1}, then so would be f_n = g - (g - f_n). But this contradicts our earlier assumption. Hence g - f_n is not an R-linear combination fo f_0, ... f_{n-1}.
[07:47:41] <isekaijin> ARGH
[07:47:47] <isekaijin> I meant to say R[x]-linear, my bad.
[07:47:51] <isekaijin> I am going to write this down properly.

[10:14:24] <Decker> However, since we know that "Not all lemons are yellow" (as this has been assumed), the first part is false, and hence the second part must be true to ensure the two-part statement to be true, i.e., unicorns exist.
[10:14:47] <Decker> (1,2) We know that "Not all lemons are yellow", as it has been assumed to be true.

[10:46:23] <brownorange> the answer is: it depends on the map. hence principle of explosion is not a tautology
[10:46:44] <Decker> '  No matter what the individual parts are, the result is a true statement; a tautology is always true. The opposite of a tautology is a contradiction or a fallacy, which is "always false". '

[11:20:10] <brownorange> In temporal logic there's an interesting situation where P does not exist as an effect of P, nor does P cause P

[13:06:13] <cherim> If you consider changes in F_x under small displacements from (1,1,1), you need dF_x/dx, dF_x/dy, dF_x/dz (d for partial derivatives)
[13:07:07] <cherim> You only computed (and found equal to 0) dF_x/dx, dF_y/dy, dF_z/dz. Of 9 values of dF_a/db type, only 3.
[13:08:07] <silv3r_m00n2> cherim: consider, y and z unchanged, that is dy=dz=0, what then
[13:08:56] <cherim> Then one component of the vector grad F indeed doesn't change when moved in that direction (to first order of displacement)
[13:09:54] <silv3r_m00n2> i am just considering change in vector F itself at 1,1,1 if only x changes by dx, it seems F will not change at all, which seems weird

[13:55:41] <kronicmage> cherim how can you tell?
[13:55:56] <cherim> A^{-2} is Hermitian, so A is diagonalizable (if not, then A^{-2} is also non-diagonalizable and not Hermitian).
[13:56:02] <cherim> If x is an eigenvalue of A, then x^* = x^{-3}, so |x|=1, x^2=1, and x is in {+1, -1}.
[13:56:03] * enyc meows
[13:56:11] <cherim> Diagonalizable matrix with eigenvalues in {+1, -1} satisfies A^2=I, so A^* A= A^-2 = A^2 and A^*=A.

[14:08:37] <PlanckWalk> A 35.45% increase is multiplying by 1.3545, so to get the inverse you divide by 1.3545.
[14:09:41] <PlanckWalk> (Though it's pretty darn bizarre for encryption to make a file 35.45% bigger)
[14:10:19] <PlanckWalk> Unless you're doing something weird like starting with a binary file, then encrypting it, and then producing a base-64 encoding of the encryption output.

[14:12:25] <PlanckWalk> Yes, that fits pretty well.  Base64-encoding with newlines inserted after every 63 characters gives 35.42% size increase, so there's probably just rounding errors.

[17:51:32] <isekaijin> [itchyjunk]: Make no mistake, Coq is not an ordinary programming language in which you can write a “sort of okay” program, and then it runs “sort of okay”.
[17:51:46] <isekaijin> Coq bitches about formalities that even humans would not bitch about.
[17:52:09] <isekaijin> It makes C++ look like a forgiving language.
[17:54:52] <[itchyjunk]> I did hello world in coq
[17:55:25] <[itchyjunk]> i proved n+0 = n, n in N. n*0 = 0. and P->Q and Q->R then P->R
[17:55:30] <Galois> the hard part in Coq isn't exactly proving theorems, although that's plenty hard. It's writing recursive definitions.
[17:55:59] <Galois> in ordinary programming you can always recurse at will. In Coq, you have to prove that your recursion terminates. This is rather hard to do if you haven't defined the recursion yet.
[17:56:33] <isekaijin> Right, your Fixpoint and CoFixpoint definitions have to match the structure of your Inductive and CoInductive types, so you have to be careful about how you define the latter.
[17:56:53] <Z-module> [itchyjunk]: on the other hand, sometimes some very odd-looking stuff in polynomial rings does crop up. For example, if F is a field, check that  { ax^3 + bx^5 + cx^6 + dx^8 + (zero or more higher-power terms) : a,b,c,d in F }  is a subring of F[x] but not an ideal.
[17:57:02] <isekaijin> As a programmer, I am used to assume I have general recursion, and prove termination as an afterthought.
[17:57:07] <isekaijin> Coq very much does not like that.
[18:00:28] <mornfall> structural recursion should always work; that covers quite a few cases, though of course there are many that don't fit
[18:01:02] <isekaijin> The problem for me is that baking the termination proof into the program can bloat the program.
[18:01:29] <mornfall> of course; so does proving that a divisor is non-zero
[18:01:39] <mornfall> it's a death of thousand cuts
[18:03:30] <isekaijin> I learnt to program with languages like Pascal and C, so I still wish for programs to compile to reasonably efficient native executables (for the target machine), and for compilers not to have to make a Herculean effort to achieve this.

[18:05:12] <mornfall> aren't you thinking of embedded systems where running out of stack is a big concern?
[18:05:40] <isekaijin> [itchyjunk]: What I find hard to debug is the implicit use of the call stack as a data structure of unbounded size.
[18:05:58] <isekaijin> So recursion that is not tail recursion is hard to debug.
[18:06:05] <mornfall> especially on systems where running out of stack actually means writing over random non-stack data (well, not so random)
[18:06:27] <[itchyjunk]> use of call stack as data structure

[18:56:15] <isekaijin> Is there any reason why calculus students studying series seem to only learn the ratio test?
[18:57:37] <isekaijin> You give them any series “sum_n b_n” such that “abs(a_{n+1} / a_n)” converges to 1, and then they are completely unable to think of another way in which the convergence or divergence of the series could be established.

[18:58:14] <isekaijin> Errr, “abs(b_{n+1} / b_n)”, of course.
[18:58:24] <isekaijin> In particular, the comparison test apparently does not exist.
[18:59:01] <isekaijin> Maybe the hard part about using the comparison test is coming up with another series that is known to be convergent or divergent.

[20:14:24] <riv> ideals are rings?
[20:14:47] <[itchyjunk]> well subrings are ring structure, pretty much full grown ring no?
[20:14:47] <riv> why have i never known this
[20:14:48] <Franciman> yes
[20:14:48] <int-e> riv: it depends on what you consider to be a ring
[20:15:00] <[itchyjunk]> hmm
[20:15:02] <int-e> riv: there's the usual confusion about units
[20:15:03] <Franciman> ah right
[20:15:08] <riv> wait take 2Z
[20:15:10] <riv> thats not a ring
[20:15:13] <riv> it doesn't have 1 in it
[20:15:18] <Franciman> they are
[20:15:19] <Franciman> rngs
[20:15:27] <[itchyjunk]> oh, why did i think ideals were rings then?
[20:15:32] <[itchyjunk]> not sure why i picked that up
[20:15:36] <Franciman> because some don't require 1 to be in the ring
[20:15:45] <Franciman> for example I don't
[20:15:49] <Franciman> in what I studied
[20:15:51] <int-e> [itchyjunk]: because it's true if rings don't need to have a unit.
[20:15:52] <Franciman> so ideals are rngs for me
[20:15:55] <[itchyjunk]> right but we used artin. even non commutative rings weren't rings for him
[20:16:12] <[itchyjunk]> do rngs have ideals and other stuff we talk about in rings?
[20:16:33] <[itchyjunk]> how different are the theorems between rng and rings? :s
[20:16:34] <int-e> the definition doesn't rely on units... so sure
[20:16:41] <[itchyjunk]> hmmmm
[20:16:48] <int-e> (of an ideal)
[20:17:01] <int-e> polynomials over rngs are weird
[20:17:36] <int-e> (no monic polynomials? eww)
[20:17:37] <[itchyjunk]> 1 can be the generator of an ideal that the same as the ring. so a finite generator
[20:17:46] <[itchyjunk]> without that 1, i might not have a finite generator of that ideal no?
[20:18:36] <[itchyjunk]> in any cases, ideals are weird things
[20:18:45] <riv> ideals are a generalization of 0
[20:18:52] <riv> the thing about zero is anything * zero is zero
[20:18:53] <[itchyjunk]> hmmmmm
[20:18:58] <[itchyjunk]> oh true
[20:19:09] <riv> it absorbs everything
[20:19:11] <riv> so does an ideal
[20:19:39] <riv> when you take quotients like, Z/5Z, what are you sort of doing is saying that everything in the ideal 5Z is now zero, 0 = 5 = 10 = ..
[20:19:39] <[itchyjunk]> there was something we thought of as prime numbers somwhere too
[20:19:42] <[itchyjunk]> prime domain?
[20:19:57] <Franciman> you are abstracting part of the structure out
[20:20:02] <Franciman> you are talking about elements of z
[20:20:06] <Franciman> up to a term you ignore
[20:20:11] <Franciman> abstracted out
[20:20:30] <isekaijin> [itchyjunk]: If you are working with rings without unit, then all ideals are subrings.
[20:20:34] <[itchyjunk]> so i think think of Z has a lego made up of different structure and i can just remove part of it?
[20:20:47] <[itchyjunk]> isekaijin, that seems kind nice no?
[20:20:55] <isekaijin> [itchyjunk]: No.
[20:20:58] <[itchyjunk]> ideals just end up being sungring and it's like groups and subgroups
[20:21:00] <isekaijin> There is nothing nice about rings without unit.
[20:21:02] <[itchyjunk]> rings and subrings
[20:21:06] <Franciman> [itchyjunk]: prime ideal
[20:21:10] <isekaijin> Pure algebraists consider them for some reason.
[20:21:20] <[itchyjunk]> oh ideals themselves can be prime ideals..
[20:21:28] <Franciman> every rng can be embedded in a ring with unit
[20:21:32] <[itchyjunk]> i forgot such things existed.. what does ie mtena for ideal to be prime?
[20:21:39] <Franciman> so it's probably ludicrous
[20:21:48] <Franciman> [itchyjunk]: similar to prime numbers
[20:21:53] <Franciman> I prime ideal iff
[20:22:03] <Franciman> fg \in I implies f \in I or g \in I
[20:22:22] <isekaijin> [itchyjunk]: If R is a commutative ring with unit, then we say that an ideal p of R is prime iff its complement R\p is closed under multiplication.
[20:22:23] <[itchyjunk]> how is that like prime numbers? >.>
[20:22:26] <Franciman> ahah
[20:22:28] <Franciman> because
[20:22:31] <[itchyjunk]> wait, is this somehow related to gotherdick?
[20:22:32] <Franciman> fg \in (a)
[20:22:35] <isekaijin> Argggh, I phrased it horribly.
[20:22:36] <Franciman> means
[20:22:41] <Franciman> fg is divisible by a
[20:22:51] <Franciman> i.e.
[20:22:53] <Franciman> fg = r*a

[20:25:03] <isekaijin> No, no, don't shut up.
[20:25:08] <isekaijin> I'm just making an observation.
[20:25:43] <Franciman> there are three very clear definitions
[20:25:46] <Franciman> isekaijin's
[20:25:50] <Franciman> what I said above and a third
[20:26:10] <Franciman> I is prime ideal of R, iff, R/I does not have 0 divisors
[20:27:46] <[itchyjunk]> p prime and p|ab => p|a or p|b? i vaguly remember euler or somesuch talking about this.. i can't remember properties of prime :D
[20:28:08] <int-e> that would be a prime element
[20:28:36] <[itchyjunk]> right i am trying to recall prime to understand why prime ideals are thought of as primes
[20:29:12] <riv> first there is a kind of ideal called a principal ideal
[20:29:25] <riv> 5Z earlier was an example of a principal ideal
[20:29:51] <riv> given a ring R, a principal ideal is an ideal of the form aR for some a in R
[20:32:41] <[itchyjunk]> i remember domains vaguely.. principle domain , something something domain
[20:32:53] <[itchyjunk]> can't believe everything exits the brain in less than a year

[20:34:24] <[itchyjunk]> can't forget more, can i?
[20:34:44] <riv> a principal ideal domain is a ring where every ideal is principal
[20:34:47] <riv> Z is an example of this
[20:35:22] <[itchyjunk]> ah

[20:42:01] <W> "generated by" is one of those things I often encounter in mathematics but don't have a solid grasp on (though it probably means it just means different things in different contexts) - in this case, you mean where those elements are considered equivalent to zero, as in anything multiplied by them (assuming commutative ring here) is zero or equivalent

[20:44:31] <isekaijin> Ideals are just modules that happen submodules of the ring.
[20:46:31] <riv> in category theory you have the notion of forgetting the module structure, or group structure of a structure - to get just a set as a result
[20:46:51] <riv> and there is a pseudo-inverse to this, that freely generates a structure from a set

[21:17:01] <Franciman> no
[21:17:10] <Franciman> no wait yes

[21:18:49] <Franciman> wait cherim
[21:18:52] <Franciman> if x is irrational
[21:19:00] <Franciman> and it belongs to U_k
[21:19:17] <Franciman> so ok

[21:19:52] <greenbagels> sorry, yes, only for k
[21:20:05] <Franciman> so ok, what cherim said
[21:20:08] <greenbagels> let me clarify
[21:20:16] <Franciman> you should prove that (x-1/k, x+1/k) does not contain any rational number
[21:20:30] <greenbagels> if x is REAL and is in the INTERSECTION of all U_k, then it is within 1/k distance of a rational for all natural k
[21:20:32] <isekaijin> But is that possible?
[21:20:41] <mycroftiv> arent you trying to prove something that is false?
[21:20:55] <greenbagels> rationals and irratioanls are dense in R; they're contained in every interval
[21:21:04] <greenbagels> so you can't prove that interval doesn't contain a rational
[21:21:34] <cherim> You surround each rational by an interval of fixed width 2/k, and then take union over all rationals to get U_k. Already such unions with centers in {m/k : m in Z} cover R.
[21:22:15] <greenbagels> cherim: right but the covering of R isn't really the core idea here
[21:22:30] <Franciman> still cherim proved that U_k = R

[21:38:07] <Franciman> thanks mycroftiv
[21:38:10] <cherim> Then it's essentially a restatement of Baire

[21:38:42] <Franciman> it's numerable intersection of dense open sets

[22:03:00] <W> category theory probably have something to say about this, but naively I'd say an isomorphism says that two things can be treated the same by a class of formulas, and once you go outside that class of formulas you have no such guarantees
[22:03:01] <emby> yeah.
[22:03:04] <Franciman> if you represent groups by tables (i.e. as tables of products)

[22:10:12] <emby> Well a subgroup is a group and 2Z and 3Z are isomorphic as groups. The fact that Z/2Z and Z/3Z are not isomorphic as groups shows that two things can be isomorphic and still have different impacts on the rest of the world.

[23:50:03] <laurus> Let's say we're given a generator G. We can create the Dynkin system delta(G) from that. Then we apply Lemma 5.4 to that. So why is Lemma 5.4 not applicable to the case where we are given a generator?
