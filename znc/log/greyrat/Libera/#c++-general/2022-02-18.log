[00:21:55] <leonardus> if someone is using a build system that's built into the IDE for their project, and they want to send it to someone else and want them to be able to build it, do they then have to write a makefile just so they can build it, or require that the user be using the same IDE, or is there a better way to go about doing that? because if not, I don't see why anyone is using ide build systems for anything but small personal projects,
[00:21:55] <leonardus> or a company project where everyone is on the same ide
[00:22:18] <rpav> modern IDEs/editors/etc can all more or less use cmake
[00:22:47] <rpav> so the idea is you write cmake, load that in your ide/whatever, and then whoever else needs to use it can do so with cmake too
[00:23:16] <MaddHatter> What IDE has its own built-in bulid system?
[00:23:47] <rpav> well you can split hairs about "built-in" or not, but VS would generally be considered to have its build system "built in"
[00:24:06] <leonardus> MaddHatter: codewarrior does it I think
[00:24:43] <rpav> so do probably most aging IDEs .. qt creator uses cmake now, though it probably used qmake before .. but eclipse surely does? Xcode ... err
[00:25:00] <MaddHatter> rpav: yeah, I was thinking that, but it's really more of a proprietary build system that VS (and others, like msbuild) happen to implement
[00:25:17] <niko3> clion is the best ide
[00:25:19] <rpav> MaddHatter: sure but it's close enough as to be what anyone would mean
[00:25:29] <rpav> clion is pretty good
[00:25:44] <MaddHatter> does clion have its own build system?
[00:25:48] <rpav> no, it uses cmake
[00:26:07] <MaddHatter> I never got clion to work for me
[00:26:28] <rpav> how is that possible .. it's a pretty painless out of the box experience
[00:27:14] *** test_ is now known as _flood
[00:27:16] <MaddHatter> ate up a huge amount of memory; crashed a lot; didn't understand the code so always jumping to the wrong places or unable to find stuff
[00:27:30] <rpav> weird
[00:27:54] <MaddHatter> it felt virtually identical to eclipse, which suffers the same issues
[00:28:05] <rpav> it will definitely eat a chunk of memory, but i don't really remember it crashing much if at all .. when i was using it, it was just starting to transition to lsp/clangd so it occasionally had trouble grokking c++17, but
[00:28:18] <rpav> maybe someone `ln -s eclipse clion`
[00:29:01] <MaddHatter> no, I downloaded both to try out at one point, because whatever I was using before was also not doing well

[00:42:41] <Alipha> DSpider: i generally don't see people bother with constexpr for lambdas. as a whole, i don't think people bother with constexpr other than for creating named constants for integers/bools
[00:43:01] <rpav> what about all the constexpr functions D:
[00:43:18] <Alipha> DSpider: unless they specifically need constexpr because they need a constant for an array index or template parameter
[00:44:08] <Alipha> rpav: as a library writer, it's good to constexpr everything you can. as an application writer, i wouldn't bother with constexpr unless you specifically need it for one of the above situations
[00:44:24] <rpav> Alipha: oh, yeah
[00:44:41] <rpav> i can't imagine not writing a bunch of utility stuff though
[00:45:54] <Alipha> noexcept is another thing that i don't think the people should generally bother with, except on move constructors and move operator=. worrying about whether a function is constexpr or noexcept just slows you down for no gain
[00:46:12] <Alipha> slows the programmer down, to clarify
[00:46:37] <rpav> i'm lucky to remember noexcept on move, mostly because even writing a bunch of library stuff, i so _rarely_ need explicit move ctors
[00:47:46] <rpav> mostly for RAII .. but i wrote this easy_raii thing that takes two lambdas .. one for immediate use and one for "do this on delete," i think probably i'd use that or a subclassable variation for future raii stuff
[00:48:24] <cbreak> sounds like boost's scope guard thing
[00:48:41] <rpav> although i think there's an annoying issue where you can't do subclassing raii because of dtor order
[00:49:05] <rpav> cbreak: probably, but it's raii, and you can move it around for passing the responsibility, which is pretty neat
[00:49:21] <rpav> and/so

[02:19:55] <night_wulfe> In this Cppcon talk, https://youtu.be/I8QJLGI0GOE?t=2091, Line 3 of the code on the slide has `if constexpr (memcpyable<InputIterator, InputSentinel, OutputIterator>)` followed by `if (!std::is_constant_evaluated()). The else branch on both conditions do the same thing, so my question is why is line 4 necessary? Doesn't the `if constexpr` on line already do this check?
[02:22:03] <night_wulfe> I should clarify I realize they're doing the opposite, but I don't see why it couldn't just be written as `if constexpr (memcpyable....) { return uninitialized(...); } else { cpp_memcpy(...); }

[05:44:21] <night_wulfe> hnOsmium0001[m]: I must be missing something obvious. As I understand it, if constexpr may result in the evaluated block staying and the rest removed for that template instantiation. Conceptually similar to doing #if defined(USE_MEMCPY) ... #else ... #endif. What I don't understand is what the `is_constant_evaluated()` check is adding that isn't already handled by the `if constexpr` statement
[05:45:57] <night_wulfe> Let me ask a different way
[05:46:05] <hnOsmium0001[m]> night_wulfe: let's simplify the function to: `template <bool v> constexpr void f() { if constexpr(v) { a(); } else { b(); } }`
[05:46:58] <hnOsmium0001[m]> can the call to `a()` be not constexpr? Yes, because you can call f() in a non-constexpr context, and if you take the analogy of #ifdef, by instanciating the template all you get is a function like `void f<true>() { a(); }`, which has nothing "constexpr" in it
[05:48:04] <hnOsmium0001[m]> maybe you are missing the part where a constexpr function can be called in a non-constexpr context, and all it will do is move the computation runtime?
[05:48:54] <night_wulfe> hnOsmium0001[m]: Being called outside of a constexpr context is something I forgot about, but wouldn't is_constant_evaluated() then return false? Maybe it's because I don't know what is_constant_evaluated really does and I'm making false assumptions about what it returns
[05:49:26] <hnOsmium0001[m]> it could return true or false depending on whether you called it in a constexpr context or ot

[05:55:52] <night_wulfe> I think my issue is that I am treating the `if constexpr(memcpyable)` as if it will have the same return value `if (std::is_constant_evaluated())` which I suppose is not true. Though I can't think of a situation where that would be the case.

[06:10:12] <night_wulfe> hnOsmium0001[m]: Ok. I think I get it. The first check is determining if the type can be trivially copied, which is something known at compile time and therefore can be constexpr. However, just because that is known doesn't mean the actual copy is occurring in a constexpr context, so it has to delegate to either cpp's memcpy or a custom constexpr memcpy depending on is_constant_evaluated

[10:12:39] <ville> pulse: depends on the distro. most direct is that you are an offical packager for that distro of course. then probably writing the packages your self and asking on a mailing list if they would be accepted. they'll probably end up in a "testing" repo of some kind for a period.
[10:14:26] <ville> pulse: to improve your chances there, you know iron out any bugs and such, make the packages and if the distro has some kind of user-run repos try getting on one of those before the official ones. some have route to get included from there into the official ones
[10:15:46] <ville> pulse: many distros have the ability to add additional package repos anyway, so you can run your own of those as well until such time you get into the official repo
