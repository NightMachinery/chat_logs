[02:43:06] <spudpnds> My guess is it's workflow dependent on how much benefit you'll see switching. I've heard nearly equal parts "gush" to "meh" when it comes to the performance improvements.
[02:43:39] <spudpnds> What massively improved my workflow was not running and Emacs build with all compiler optimizations disabled, now that was slow.

[12:11:58] <wasamasa> that shader program can for example just map the texture as is on the triangle, but it can do fancier things like combining it with a color or shift the texture around depending on some external variable

[15:37:14] <johnhamelink> Hi friends! I've been using emacs for some time (using spacemacs and doom-emacs),  but after working on a legacy (and terribly maintained) PHP project, emacs became very slow and unusable for some of those files. I've been using phpstorm for the past year, but - to be hoenst - it's not super fast either. Anyway, I've been working on a brand new config for myself and now my emacs is much faster than anything I've used before - 
[15:37:14] <johnhamelink> even while using lsp-mode and dap-mode!

[15:39:30] <johnhamelink> I have a question, though - I'm using a dir-locals.el file in this legacy PHP codebase in order to blacklist directories, etc, and one thing I'd like to do is to run (require 'dap-php), but I'm struggling to figure out the syntax. I've tried the following https://bpa.st/J4RQ, but it doesn't work as expected and now I'm stumped.  What do I need to read to get the dir-locals file to evaluate a require function?

[15:48:08] <johnhamelink> jcj: perfection! Thank you.  Do you know why is the eval necessary, for my understanding?
[15:48:09] <twb> It is a security issue for dir-locals to call eval or require

[15:48:24] <twb> The traditional name for this issue is "word macro virus"
[15:48:44] <johnhamelink> haha! Is there a better way to enable dap-php for php files?
[15:48:59] <twb> You would need the user to opt-into it with an autoload

[15:49:36] <johnhamelink> yeah that's right twb, it triggers a dialogue asking if the user is happy with it
[15:49:40] <bpalmer> johnhamelink: simply requiring dap-php enables it? You don't have to call a dap-php-mode or something?
[15:50:04] <twb> johnhamelink: ah I expected it to just be ignored
[15:50:37] <twb> What is dap-php and why wouldn't it just be enabled by default as soon as it is installed?
[15:50:38] <johnhamelink> The dap-php file is part of the dap-mode package bpalmer , so  I already have dap-mode running, but I don't always want to enable the php-portion of it
[15:51:11] <johnhamelink> The instructions just vaguely say you need to run that require code block
[15:51:47] <johnhamelink>  See here: https://emacs-lsp.github.io/dap-mode/page/configuration/#php :)
[15:52:33] <twb> johnhamelink: note that if you put something like this in dir-locals, then all your coworkers will also get it when they edit that codebase

[15:57:02] <johnhamelink> I'm happy to enable dap-php for any php-mode buffer
[15:57:03] <twb> Maybe "enable-local-eval nil" *is* sufficient and I just have a long memory
[15:57:43] <johnhamelink> > A value of nil means ignore them; anything else means query.
[15:57:57] <johnhamelink> Seems so?

[22:03:27] <stm> ed was actually pretty useful for me when I started as sysadmin. The workstation console was line-oriented, so any 'modern' editor like vi would work. You needed ed to fix things when the machine wouldn't boot to multiuser.

[23:31:58] <andreyorst> does anyone know what controls the set of languages known by org-mode HTML export feature? E.g. I have Clojure code block in the buffer, and when I export to HTML, I get the highlighting, but when I change Clojure to Fennel, I get no highlighting. I've thought that Org uses Emacs' font locking to get syntax highlighting info for exporting, am I mistaken here?

[23:42:32] <lampilelo> you're sure coda? andreyorst: does it highlight fennel in the org buffer? 
[23:42:46] <lampilelo> maybe you just need to add fennel to org-src-lang-modes

[23:47:32] <andreyorst> as for org-src-lang-modes, I don't think so, since there's no Clojure in this list, but Clojure is highlighted, but lemme try it
