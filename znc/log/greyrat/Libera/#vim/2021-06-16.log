[03:14:53] <ash_worksi> how does it not play nice? (not that I don't believe you, just curious)

[03:17:47] <ash_worksi> with lightline anyway
[03:17:57] <nickspoon> ash_worksi: oh do they work together out of the box now?
[03:18:06] <ash_worksi> it says: After installing this plugin, you restart the editor and will get a cool statusline.
[03:18:21] <ash_worksi> which I did not, and though "UUUGH"
[03:18:27] <ash_worksi> thought*
[03:18:42] <nickspoon> Does lightline show whether ALE is actually currently running a linter?
[03:18:56] <nickspoon> I have something in my statusline which does, it's not too hard to add
[03:19:10] <nickspoon> But I wouldn't know exactly how to do it in lightline without tinkering

[03:21:13] *** DrainTheSwamp is now known as Izeau
[03:22:08] <ash_worksi> after looking at a few examples of whatever here it seemed that an ftplugin is just an isolated .vimrc file from what I could tell
[03:22:49] <ash_worksi> anyway, i gtg unfortunately, but I will look over that github issue
[03:22:56] <nickspoon> Yeah. ftplugin/whatever.vim files are files which are sourced every time a file of filetype "whatever" is opened
[03:22:59] <ash_worksi> hopefully after tinkering I will be able to see what ALE is doing
[03:23:10] <nickspoon> So a great place for putting filetype-specific mappings and settings
[03:23:13] <ash_worksi> makes sense
[03:23:57] <ash_worksi> for me, (I guess) it made sense to just set g:ale_command_wrapper = 'docker-compose run --rm linter %*'
[03:24:26] <ash_worksi> it would seem the files can be properly mapped that way through docker-compose
[03:24:43] <ash_worksi> I'm sure to have a lot of questions about ALE and lightline when I return

[18:47:23] <osse> hkm: how do you copy them from vim in the first place?
[18:47:57] <hkm> osse: with a mouse :(  I havent looked into Xclip yet

[18:49:04] <hkm> osse: 0
[18:49:12] <osse> well shit
[18:49:37] <osse> the problem is that you copy what vim displays in the terminal, not the actual contents of the file
[18:49:45] <hkm> hmm, I see
[18:49:52] <osse> the best solution is to make that thing print 1 instead of 0
[18:50:01] <osse> usually by installing a beefier vim package
[18:50:17] <osse> and then let vim put the contents into the clipboard itself

[18:51:56] <hkm> what do you suggest?
[18:52:08] <osse> vim-x11 or vim-gtk or vim-huge or gvim
[18:52:12] <osse> depends a bit on your OS
[18:53:18] <hkm> installing vim-gtk :)
[18:54:15] <osse> hkm: are you well versed in the use of registers in vim?
[18:54:15] <hkm> echo has("clipboard") is 1 hooray
[18:54:31] <osse> e.g. "ayy to copy into register a and then paste it with "ap and such?
[18:54:43] <hkm> yes i know what that is
[18:54:53] <osse> perfect. 
[18:55:07] <osse> if you know copy into register + instead it goes to the clipboard
[18:55:10] <osse> so use that.
