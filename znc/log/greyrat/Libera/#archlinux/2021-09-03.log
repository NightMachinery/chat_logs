[05:48:12] <phrik> Title: GRUB - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
[05:48:12] <sheep> it depends on whether you generate grub.cfg or hand-write it. If you generate it, edit GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX in /etc/default/grub
[05:48:22] <ParsnipChicken> I generated it.

[05:49:48] <ParsnipChicken> The generated file appears to have a `GRUB-ENABLE-CRYPTODISK` option. Can I just uncomment that?

[05:50:13] <sheep> that's different. That's for grub loading itself from an encrypted device
[05:50:14] <phrik> Title: dm-crypt/Encrypting an entire system - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
[05:50:37] <sheep> even with that option you still need to set the command line thing

[05:55:32] <sheep> rw applies for all bootloaders
[05:55:43] <ParsnipChicken> What exactly does it do?

[09:42:52] <neff> grawity,i am sorry to bother you,but,what a "ldconfig file is empty,not cheking" means? how i can fix it too?

[09:43:05] <grawity> neff: dunno, where's that from?
[09:43:16] <sudoforge> long 3 hour bullshit at work to end the day
[09:43:30] <sheep> it probably means that you have a corrupted library file somewhere
[09:43:41] <neff> grawity update some aur packages and then saw it

[09:44:19] <grawity> ah, right
[09:44:31] <grawity> that's ldconfig itself building the library cache and telling you that some of your files are empty

[09:44:56] <neff> Ok...and what i need to do?

[09:45:16] <sheep> *libraries

[11:33:52] <gulzar> Tom^: Hey,. I tried that prime-run method. The GPU was off but still  getting heatup. So removed it and back to optimus-manager
[11:34:37] <Tom^> gulzar: odd hrm
[11:35:25] <jelle> horseface: did you listen to what I said ;-) did you check dmesg and grep for audio things
[11:36:08] <HEX0> horseface: some new sound cards seem to require this thing https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/sof-firmware/
[11:36:10] <phrik> Title: Arch Linux - sof-firmware 1.8-1 (x86_64) (at archlinux.org)
[11:36:57] <Tom^> gulzar: are you sure cat /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:01:00.0/power/control was actually telling you it was off?
[11:37:13] <Tom^> gulzar: ive made this summary anyhow on how ive set it up https://gist.github.com/gulafaran/d87e05d940f909ae0beb1863ebfbfb68
[11:37:36] <gulzar> Tom^: I used nvidia-nvm or something
[11:37:55] <Tom^> any access to it powers it up, even nvidia-smi
[11:37:59] <Tom^> obviously. :p
[11:38:29] <gulzar> it says power off
[11:38:45] <gulzar> will try again sometime
[11:39:12] <horseface> yes, i did. thank yo, jelle...
[11:39:22] <horseface> i've resolved the issue. :-D

[11:40:05] <horseface> ym friend can't stop rambling about hypervisors, he used to work for the government as chief C programmer on them.
[11:40:10] <horseface> my*
[11:40:21] <horseface> i suppose it's normal.
[11:40:26] <gulzar> Tom^: i removed it, all instances using locate. Everything. Then tried the official method
[11:41:33] <Tom^> gulzar: and udev rules and modprobed.d config is setup?
[11:41:37] <Tom^> as the gist
[11:41:47] <gulzar> Tom^: yes, as wiki said
[11:41:53] <gulzar> irght now they are rmeoved

[11:44:01] <Tom^> gulzar: also its gonna require a xorg.conf.d as mine to mark nvidia as inactive to make opengl/vulkan applications behave but thats a seperate issue. as gist shows :P
[11:44:36] <gulzar> noted
[11:44:37] <Tom^> and nvidia-persistenced running because the kernel reaps its resources when powered off otherwise. 
[11:45:20] <Tom^> havent seen any in real issues without it but the sys bus file gets borked atleast, and the rumour has it kernel has to re initialize the driver each time making the power on a bit slower/launching things with prime-run

[19:00:38] <MacGyver> But it sounds like that might be exactly what's happening -- because you did say it tries to "wake up" a few minutes after hibernation.
[19:00:59] <MacGyver> What you might be seeing is, in fact, the eventual failure of the system to compress the memory image down to the set size, and subsequent abort.
[19:01:16] <MacGyver> grazzolini: I don't usually hibernate either, except when my battery level is 10% or lower.

[19:02:22] <MacGyver> Let alone hibernate.
[19:02:39] <grazzolini> HEX0: because it's heavily dependent on the manufacturers and they don't always have docs. a lot of hibernation is reverse engineered
[19:02:42] <MacGyver> The new systems haven't failed yet.

[21:11:06] <th0rne> I cannot recommend what h4rd3n3D is suggesting. By accident I ended up trying pipewire, but coming from an entirely functional pulse setup - pipewire certainly had more issues.

[21:13:45] <th0rne> 'pacman -F' is the solution to any "command not found".
[21:13:52] <raster> I wouldn't advise pipewire either until it has settled and stood the test of time - it may work for you. it may not, but chances are it's had far less maturity, so unless you wish to actually debug and fix the issues... pulse is your better bet. if you have one issue with pulse then figuring out a solution to just that is probably better. For me pulse is flawless on all my machines (except one set of BT headphones where 
[21:13:52] <raster> it's a bit flakey but it may not be pulse's issue and more bluez...)

[21:17:22] <h4rd3n3D> th0rne:  prolly, google, and really (likely no less FUCKED) than today
[21:18:04] <raster> Tom^: it boots but the kernel loads a memory-image of what was in memory in terms of processes etc. and then executes that where it left off
[21:18:17] <raster> that image is stored on disk (eg in swap)
[21:18:19] <Tom^> raster: right, ok then it worked as intended
[21:18:27] <Tom^> wopdedo :p
[21:18:33] <SysGhost> jamesp: update and reboot is a nice first step to a problem. often it's just about a kernel update where one didn't reboot
[21:18:34] <mpan> dotz0cat[m]: if you are using a PKGBUILD only once and the hashes do not match, but you have no source to provide them to you, you may simply skip integrity checks. For that particular purpose they offer no advantage.
[21:18:52] <th0rne> h4rd3n3D❱ So your first advised solution is "use a different software" and your second advised solution is "google it". Why even answer people on this channel, then?
[21:18:53] <raster> the bonus of hibernate is that you use zero power while hibernated unlike suspend which needs power to keep ram refreshed (for example)

[21:20:56] <raster> it is slower to resume though as you do need that bios boot cycle bit and have to load stuff from disk... but depends on your hw there . i think there might be a special fast biso mode for hibernate resume that avoids a bunch of checks... but i'm not 100% sure on if that's separate from normal bios fast-boot modes
[21:21:14] <mpan> dotz0cat[m]: if you recalculate them to be used once and only once, there is nothing to compare them against. So at this point `--skipchecksums` is a sane choice. Not true if you are willing to use the PKGBUILD later, publish it etc.
[21:21:26] <raster> i tend to just use suspend to ram and otherwise shut down and full reboot as a full reboot is like 2-3 seconds post-bios anyway
[21:22:28] <dotz0cat[m]> Well I had no idea the —skipchecksums exsited
[21:22:52] <h4rd3n3D> th0rne:  I suggested a 'different software' (called pipewire) because I KNOW it works on a fully updated/rebooted KDE Plasma 5 system which jamesp is also running.  PLEASE STOP attempting to twist my words!

[21:25:44] <mpan> dotz0cat[m]: just don’t confuse it with `--skipinteg` or `--skippgpcheck`, which you should normally not skip. `--skipchecksums` merely ignores checksums that protected against random errors and those will change from version to version. `--skippgpchceck` and `--skipinteg` will skip digital signatures. Which affects security, while under normal circumstances those should not fail.
