[12:08:09] <zamba> i have difficulties delivering mail to o365 from my mta..
[12:08:34] <zamba> it's basically black-holed.. the recipient doesn't receive it anywhere.. not even in their spam folder..
[12:09:08] <zamba> is there a way i can troubleshoot this externally? does o365 have some tools published where i can check our reputation, for instance?
[12:16:17] <pj> !tell zamba deliverability
[12:16:18] <dig-dug> zamba: deliverability: (#1) If you're having problems getting your mail received by major ESPs you should first check your !fcrdns, then make sure you have SPF, DKIM and DMARC configured (see !easy_dmarc). Sign up for the dnswl at http://www.dnswl.org. Also sign up for ESP-specific programs such as feedback loops, Google postmaster tools and Microsoft's SNDS., or (#2) Check the individual postmaster pages for each ESP
[12:16:19] <dig-dug> that you're having problems with to make sure that you're in compliance with all of their policies and if you still have problems contact the support for the ESP., or (#3) Also check to make sure you're not on any DNSRBLs and submit removal requests from any you appear on. See !multirbl.
[12:16:36] <pj> zamba: check and make sure you're doing all of this ^^^^^
[12:19:17] <zamba> !fcrdns
[12:19:18] <dig-dug> zamba: fcrdns: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_Confirmed_reverse_DNS : your IP address should resolve to your HELO/EHLO hostname, which in turn should resolve back to your IP. This is very important if you want big sites to accept your mail. If you can't have it from your ISP, see !relayhost
[12:25:41] <zamba> i have signed up to microsoft's snds.. but there's "no data" there
[12:25:52] <zamba> even though i have delivered quite a few emails towards o365
[12:26:04] <zamba> fcrdns is also ok
[12:26:15] <zamba> and i'm not on any of the dnsrbls
[12:26:18] <zamba> !multirbl
[12:26:20] <dig-dug> zamba: multirbl: use http://multirbl.valli.org/ to check multiple RBLs to see if an IP address is listed on any known blacklists.
[12:26:50] <zamba> everything is green on the multirbl check
[12:27:38] *** Quits: menace (~someone@ppp-93-104-173-139.dynamic.mnet-online.de) (Quit: menace)
[12:27:51] <zamba> though a few failed, but i suspect that's due to some dns issue on the check itself
[12:27:58] <zamba> Neutrallisted: 11
[12:29:39] <zamba> !easy_dmarc
[12:29:40] <dig-dug> zamba: easy_dmarc: If you just need a DMARC policy to help satisfy ESP recommendations you can use this to basically tell servers not to enforce DMARC on your mail: _dmarc.example.com. TXT "v=DMARC1;p=none;adkim=r;aspf=r;pct=0"
[12:30:41] <zamba> i also have spf set up.. setting up easy dmarc now
