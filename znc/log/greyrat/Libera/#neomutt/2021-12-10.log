[12:59:14] <channoti> Hi, I got an issue with reply_regex for ML prepending a '[category]' to the subject. How can I configure neomutt to be aware of that?
[13:00:07] *** Joins: sbach (~sbach@user/sbach)
[13:01:10] <channoti> Rn, Neomutt repeats the reply subject in thread view ('[category] my subject' -> '[caterogy] Re: my subject')
[13:02:36] <channoti> But the most boring is when composing a reply. Neomutt auto prepend a 'Re:' in the subject, resulting in 'Re: [category] Re: my subject'
[13:03:05] <channoti> Is there any workaround for that?

[13:50:30] <gahr> you could set reply_regex to match [category] Re:

[16:28:22] <channoti> or you did not get the second part of my answer?
[16:29:03] <gahr> yes
[16:29:16] <gahr> you don't have strict_threads on. Does it help to set it on? :)
[16:29:25] <gahr> so neomutt doesn't have to fallback to comparing subjects
[16:30:04] <channoti> gahr: it does not. The issue is not that thread is broken (reference & in-reply-to are correctly set)
[16:30:13] <channoti> The thread is correclty link
[16:30:18] <channoti> It is a minor issue
[16:30:48] <channoti> When neomutt shows thread, it shows the subject on the first message (unless it is out-of-view ofc)
[16:31:14] <channoti> and it does not shows it again further in the thread, unless subject changes
[16:31:39] <channoti> and it correctly detect a prepend Re: to avoid reshowing that subject in the index
[16:32:32] <channoti> But, in the case of '[category] my subject -> [category] Re: my subject', it will shows the subject of the first message and all the first-depth reply messages
[16:33:07] <channoti> because it fails to detect that the reply is the same subject with a 'Re:'
[16:33:12] <gahr> got it
[16:33:15] <gahr> thanks
[16:35:06] <gahr> why matching, e.g., '(Re: )?[category]( Re:)?' doesn't help?
[16:35:13] <gahr> that was meant as a pseudo-regex..
[16:36:00] <channoti> I tried '[category]( Re:)? Let me check
[16:42:32] <channoti> No, changing it to "^((re|aw|sv)*(\\[category\\] )*(re|aw|sv)(\\[[0-9]+\\])*:[ \t]*)*" does not fix the thread view issue
[16:43:01] <gahr> which part is it not capturing?
[16:43:07] <channoti> I think it just cannot ignore a change in the middle of the subject
[16:44:19] <gahr> if I read this right https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/blob/f17a0332c509e8039d749997836e26ab0512d118/email/parse.c#L1281-L1288
[16:44:26] <gahr> it should just skip until the end of the match
[16:44:52] <gahr> can you please fwd a few of those emails to me?
[16:49:12] <channoti> gahr: but I guess it has to compare it with the parent subject. Which will compare '[category] my subject' (first message)  with 'my subject' (first reply after reply_regex match)
[16:49:37] <gahr> but [category] will be removed by the reply_regex
[16:49:39] <gahr> if you include it
[16:50:04] <gahr> doing some tests locally
[16:50:15] <channoti> gahr: not on the first message, the reply_regex requires a re to appear in the initial subject
[16:51:36] <channoti> the subject of the first message ('[category] my subject') won't match anything with the reply_regex since it requires a (re|aw|sv):
[16:51:49] <gahr> that's why I suggested to make them optional
[16:51:56] <gahr> see the "?" in my pseudo-regex
[16:52:00] <channoti> gahr: sorry, missed that
[16:53:12] <channoti> Nah, it does not work either
[16:54:21] <channoti> gahr: I can fwd a thread to you. Where can I find you email address?
[16:56:10] <flatcap> for:  Subject: xy: [vim/vim] aw: syntax
[16:56:22] <flatcap> set reply_regex='(xy: )*(\[.*\] )*(aw: )*'
[16:56:32] <flatcap> worked, but only in '' single-quotes
[16:57:15] <flatcap> if you replaced the xy: and aw: bits with the "standard" re: regexes, it might work
[16:59:25] <flatcap> this monstrosity:
[16:59:29] <channoti> flatcap: set reply_regex='(re: )*(\\[.*\\] )*(re: )*'
[16:59:34] <flatcap> set reply_regex='((re|aw|sv)(\\[[0-9]+\\])*:[ \t]*)*(\[.*\] )*((re|aw|sv)(\\[[0-9]+\\])*:[ \t]*)*'
[16:59:53] <channoti> flatcap: does not fix
[17:00:40] <gahr> set reply_regex='^((Re: )?\[category\]( Re:)?)'
[17:00:42] <gahr> this works for me
[17:01:01] <gahr> I get a single '[category] some subject' displayed subject for the original one
[17:01:05] <channoti> flatcap: neither does the second one
[17:01:10] <gahr> , Re: [category] some subject

[17:01:58] <flatcap> hi gahr :-)
[17:02:28] <channoti> Is there anything except the backslash that I have to escape when setting the variable using the neomutt cmd line?
[17:03:09] <channoti> Ah, I do not need to escape if single quote
[17:04:28] <channoti> gahr: No, I still get '[category] Re: subject' in the index
[17:05:07] <flatcap> gahr: [aside] I suggested an infrastructure improvement to Coverity, and they upped our limit to 4 per day :-)
[17:06:36] <gahr> channoti: are you setting it from a running neomutt or from a config file?
[17:06:45] <gahr> config file requires you trash your header cache :/
[17:07:01] <channoti> gahr: from a running neomutt
[17:07:05] <gahr> but I confirm that set reply_regex='^((Re: )?\[category\]( Re:)?)' works for me
[17:08:16] <gahr> flatcap: nice :)
[17:08:21] <channoti> gahr: if you change in a running neomutt, and reenter the maildir, does the header cache overwrite the reply_regex change?
[17:08:50] <channoti> That could explain why it seems to work on the first try, but when reloading the folder, it does not
[17:10:03] <flatcap> do you have any folder-hooks that set reply_regex?
[17:11:07] <gahr> that could be
[17:11:14] <channoti> i.e, when I set reply_regex, the subject issue is fixed, but as soon as I trigger 'sidebar open', it fallbacks to the previous state (with the subject issue)
[17:11:15] <gahr> I'd just trash the cache to be on the safe side
[17:11:48] <gahr> I'm not even sure why we cache that
[17:11:50] <channoti> flatcap: I don't
[17:13:06] <flatcap> ok
[17:13:12] <channoti> Yeah, cache is doing it's stuff
[17:13:22] <channoti> removing cache solved that glitch
[17:14:35] <gahr> nice
[17:15:44] <channoti> Ok, the flatpac's regex monstrosity handles all subject cases I have
[17:16:01] <gahr> flatcap's da man you know
[17:16:30] <flatcap> hehe
[17:19:44] <channoti> Thank you for your precious help & time!
[17:19:48] <channoti> *both
[17:19:59] <flatcap> np
[17:21:57] <gahr> yw
[17:23:53] <flatcap> gahr: what _have_ you been up to with coverity? :-)
[17:24:05] <gahr> oh nothing special
[17:24:39] <gahr> coverity/gahr has two minor commits
[17:25:00] <flatcap> ok
[17:27:59] <gahr> I sometimes take 15 min off whatever I'm doing and have a fresh look at the report
[17:28:53] <flatcap> cool
[17:32:44] <flatcap> in email/parse.c, can we drop the MAX() altogether?
[17:32:53] <flatcap> mutt_str_atoui(body, &ui);
[17:32:54] <flatcap> e->lines = ui;
[17:33:16] <gahr> I meant to check the docs for the Lines header, but I couldn't fine any
[17:33:33] <gahr> I don't know if e.g. -1 means I don't have a lines count
[17:33:35] <gahr> or whatever
[17:34:07] <flatcap> there was something in the code about a bug, briefly once, that might have introduced some negative Lines counts
[17:34:27] <gahr> oh ok
[17:35:23] <gahr> sure then
[17:35:59] <flatcap> ok
[17:36:18] <channoti> Ok, I have a strange side effect -_-
[17:36:36] * flatcap pretends he can't hear channoti ;-)
[17:36:55] <channoti> reply_regex in config file: set reply_regex='^((re|aw|sv)(\[[0-9]+\])*:[ \t]*)*(\[usrp-users\] )*((re|aw|sv)(\[[0-9]+\])*:[ \t]*)*'
[17:37:44] <channoti> and the subjects are: 
[17:37:46] <channoti> The New Hotness 1.0.0 deployed on production
[17:38:00] <channoti> Re: The New Hotness 1.0.0 deployed on production
[17:38:21] <channoti> It does not catch the Re: and reprint the subject for the first-reply
[17:38:44] <channoti> what's strange is that if I remove the tab match in the reply regex, it works
[17:38:45] <gahr> is it case insensitive?
[17:38:49] <gahr> oh
[17:38:55] <channoti> reply_regex in config file: set reply_regex='^((re|aw|sv)(\[[0-9]+\])*:[ ]*)*(\[usrp-users\] )*((re|aw|sv)(\[[0-9]+\])*:[ ]*)*'
[17:39:07] <channoti> this one works (just removed the \t)
[17:39:27] <channoti> Could \t match the "T" from "The"
[17:40:05] <flatcap> \t _should_ be <tab>
[17:40:54] <flatcap> you probably don't need to check for <tab>
[17:42:11] <channoti> Yeah, replacing '[ \t]*' by ' *', '[ ]*' or '[[:space:]]*' works
[17:42:31] <flatcap> great
[17:44:34] <channoti> but if \t matches t, what matches <tab>?
[17:46:00] <flatcap> dunno
[17:46:32] <gahr> our default reply_regex comes with a [ \t]
[17:47:16] <flatcap> I wonder if that's a double-quotes / single-quotes thing?
[17:47:37] <gahr> I'm not sure I want to know
