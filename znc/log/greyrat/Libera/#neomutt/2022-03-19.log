[18:30:50] <dcpurton> is there a setting that applies display_filter to the quoted or included email when replying or forwarding?
[18:33:47] <dcpurton> Actually, I can do that in my editor pretty easily
[18:45:35] <flatcap> hi dcpurton
[18:46:25] <flatcap> sorry, lost in thought
[18:46:53] <dcpurton> hello!
[18:46:56] <flatcap> I can work around the <change-folder> case
[18:47:16] <dcpurton> all I need to do now is google more on regex…
[18:47:18] <flatcap> but it's another reminder of the problem I've been avoiding for years
[18:47:40] <flatcap> what are you trying to match?
[18:49:47] <dcpurton> I have \S to match non-white space only lines
[18:50:22] <dcpurton> but "> " needs to not be caught with that
[18:50:57] <dcpurton> and things like "> >> > >>"
[18:52:01] <dcpurton> but that is probably not well explain. don't worry - I will figure it out I'm sure
[18:52:36] <flatcap> an example would help
[18:52:40] <flatcap> ok, sure
[18:53:05] * flatcap likes to regularly exercise his vim-fu :-)
[19:03:59] <dcpurton> I was thinking of just filtering the buffer through the same perl script as display_filter
[19:11:58] <dcpurton> an increasingly hairy perl script it is too
