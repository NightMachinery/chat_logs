[03:39:23] <sney> Intelo32: usually predictable i/o errors are a hardware problem. either with the disk or the controller (or the cable). sometimes you can get around it by partitioning around bad parts of the disk. sometimes it's the whole disk. I guess you will find out eventually.

However when I try to view the file, with permissions 660, I get permission denied. `maxtim:$ ls -lah` on the directory renders `-?????? ? ? ? ? ? somefile.txt`. What am I doing incorrectly?

[06:28:38] <maxtim> well, I understand how the permissions octect works (somewhat... I guess working knowledge). So I think my question is why do you need executable permissions on the directory in order to manipulate files within the dir? Which, and this is just me piecing things together, it's because commands like `ls` and `cd` are executing the directory as an argument

[06:45:02] <Daniel15> maxtim: The "execute" bit does something different for directories - it specifies whether the user can enter the directory (`cd` into it) and modify details of the directory (ie. add, rename, delete files)

[06:46:57] <Daniel15> Access is very limited if you have "read" access to a directory but not "execute" access - if I remember correctly, you can still `ls` the files in the directory (eg. `ls /path/to/dir`) but can't `cd` into it and can't create new files  even if you have "write" access
[06:47:34] <maxtim> i see. that actually illuminates a great deal of frustrations i've had with samba in the past as well. 
[06:48:40] *** Quits: nekobyte (~nekobyte@user/nekobit) (Quit: nekosleep)
[06:50:09] <maxtim> my assumption has always been that if a user has read/write access to a directory, they can do all the `cd, rm, ls` they would need to do. But it makes much more sense now

[06:51:55] <Daniel15> Samba is frustrating in general :) I usually try to use NFS instead of Samba if possible in the environment (but make sure it's encrypted if you use NFS over the internet, for example using a WireGuard VPN). Access from Windows is annoying though, as the Windows NFS client is only NFSv3, which lacks some useful features from NFSv4 (proper file
[06:51:55] <Daniel15> locking, only uses a single TCP connection over a single port, rather than a mess of different ports in NFSv3)
[06:52:14] <Daniel15> Strangely the NFS server on Windows Server supports NFSv4.1, but the client doesn't
[06:53:02] <Daniel15> maxtim: Yeah, Linux permissions are very confusing at times. I've been using Linux for a long time (I'd guess maybe 15 years now?) and that execute bit on directories still trips me up sometimes.
[06:53:04] <maxtim> I'm not familiar with NFS. I'll have to look into that
[06:53:21] <Daniel15> NFS works very well if the client and server are both Linux
[06:53:41] <Daniel15> The server is built in to the kernel so it's pretty efficient

[13:52:34] <ratrace> eh what? no not more or less. it's the same release and installation. yes, it'll continue to be bullseye. "stable" is just a status, for the codenamed release.
[13:55:02] <The-Fly> ok thanks
[13:55:41] <dodo> ratrace: that is wrong. you don't know if the installer still changes things, packages get removed, etc
[13:55:59] <dodo> you have no guarantee the system will be the same

[13:56:58] <dodo> and you simply don't know the future

[13:58:21] <dodo> the question was if the current bullseye will upgrade to the same state as the future stable bullseye
[13:58:26] <ratrace> there's nothing about knowing the future. apt sources.list point to "bullseye" and that's all there is to it.
[13:58:30] <dodo> that is a no. but i'm happy to disagree about that
[13:59:09] <ratrace> bullseye is in freeze, there's no more radical changes like usrmerge or dropping syslog in favor of journald.
[13:59:24] <dodo> that is just a guess from you
[13:59:31] <ratrace> you're confusing differences between upgrade from current stable to new stable   and installing new stable from scratch
[13:59:42] <dodo> that's what the question was about

[18:11:00] <Foxfir3> PMT: I think its good if Debian stays clear of those restrictions. And the same time im wondering why Debian has to merge source in order to avoid US military/intelligence interests, since the linux foundation states that if software is open source and freely/publicly available, it does not have to adhere to the CIA/NSA regulations.
[18:11:29] <Foxfir3> So how much is fact, and how much is paranoia?
[18:12:11] <PMT> Foxfir3: I'm still not clear on which components you're talking about, sorry.
[18:12:16] <Foxfir3> Debian solves it by placing some of the sources outside the US

[18:16:12] <Foxfir3> PMT: started like this. I notice that RockyLinux were adhering to EAR and ITAR. They say its because the sources originate from a US company. But that made me wonder why. I then read this https://www.linuxfoundation.org/resources/publications/understanding-us-export-controls-with-os-projects/ and concluded that there is no issue at all. So why adhere to BIS/NSA regulations, if there is no wrong doing?
[18:17:10] <PMT> You still have not provided any concrete examples of specific pieces of software being manipulated in some ways.
[18:18:18] <Foxfir3> PMT: I cant. I was told that Debian navigated around the silly restrictions, but placing some package sources outside US terrority.
[18:18:38] <PMT> By whom?
[18:18:53] <Foxfir3> Rocky Linux forum
[18:19:39] <PMT> They may be thinking of many years ago, when Debian did indeed do that for some software.
[18:19:41] <Foxfir3> Suse also adhere to EAR and ITAR. but now im doubting that they have to do that. 
[18:20:34] <PMT> (And by "many years ago", I mean "was not included in the Debian version released in 2005")
[18:21:20] <PMT> https://wiki.debian.org/non-US

[18:21:27] <PMT> Oh, it very much is.
[18:22:44] <jelly> non-us.debian.org was closed in like.... woody? etch?
[18:22:54] <PMT> sarge did not include it.
[18:23:00] <amacater> And Rocky Linux pointed to their upstream vendors docs which point out that almost everything is free of ITAR restrictions for reasons given, inclding Mass Market and NLR [No licence requried?]
[18:23:04] <jelly> blimey
[18:23:29] <Foxfir3> good read. Thanks guys. More and more reasons to like Debian.
[18:23:57] <PMT> I don't think e.g. CentOS does that, so I can't imagine why Rocky would.
[18:24:24] <PMT> But I already don't have an especially high opinion of them, from my very limited experience.
[18:24:30] <Foxfir3> PMT: im updating them with the info from here. I was suspecting something strange was going on.

[22:17:44] <hmh> If anyone around here has a computer with an intel processor signature 0x906ea (output of "/usr/sbin/iucode-tool -Sv" shows the signature) and Intel wireless (iwlwifi), could you please test the intel-microcode update in Debian unstable and report either success or failure?
[22:18:28] <hmh> There are some reports of it interfering with iwlwifi on Ubuntu and arch-linux, we wanted to know if it also happens in Debian before allowing it outside of unstable...
[22:18:38] <sney> hmh: my laptop has an intel cpu and iwlwifi, do you know what series of cpu belongs to that signature?

[22:42:51] <jhutchins> Somebody might know from the make/model, but you can find out with cat /proc/cpuinfo - doesn't tell you the actual chipset, but it'll get you close.
[22:43:03] <jhutchins> lspci might get you closer.
[22:43:57] <PMT> The system is not booting Linux, so I figured I'd ask if it was outright impossible for it to be relevant before I broke out a live environment.
