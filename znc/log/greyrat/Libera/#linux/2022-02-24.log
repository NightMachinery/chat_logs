[01:14:34] <Alexander-47u> its true that in PHP, on a large scale, you will find the most bugs. I work as a pentester and I can confirm but there are also some hipster techniques on top of PHP, making it noobfriendly for security
[01:15:09] <Alexander-47u> for example, laravel with certain livewire extensions, make it really hard on a hacker
[01:16:03] <phogg> Alexander-47u: laravel is pretty much the cream of the crop when it comes to well written PHP code. Not perfect, but very decent. This is not the norm.
[01:16:06] <ayecee> hacking something together as a replacement for a commercial service is a great way to learn about why people use the commercial service instead.

[02:57:20] <ASDX> Dagmar: so it has already recovered after a few hours and seems to be functioning but i am trying to work out if I should have partitioned the new disk first as I see other identical running machines showing a partition table for both disks while this is only showing a table for the old member's disk

[06:23:11] <KBar> euouae: you can test that right now. set your PS1 to something like "\033[0;44m"
[06:23:17] <Guest8647> I can suggest not to use an USB as a bootable OS

[06:23:33] <rbox> Guest8647: a line of coke?
[06:23:35] <mags> I recently learned you can change the default 16 color palette in the virtual terminal with ANSI codes.
[06:24:02] <euouae> KBar but that also colors the non-command line arguments
[06:24:06] <euouae> er, s/arguments/lines
[06:24:13] <euouae> if I type $ cat, I don't want the input to be colored
[06:24:24] <naptastic> poke 867, poke 868, poke 868, poke 868, et voila, the palette has changed

[06:50:33] <Guest8647> yes, what is?
[06:50:45] <mags> You can set the background color to green or whatever, then print an entire line of spaces, then reset to the first position on the line, but then you have a line of spaces.
[06:51:02] <euouae> How do you print an entire line of spaces?
[06:51:36] <Guest8647> depends on how many characters fit
[06:51:49] <euouae> Guest8647 man bash, "       PS1    The value of this parameter is expanded (see PROMPTING below) and used as the primary prompt string.  The default value is ``\s-\v\$ ''."
[06:52:16] <euouae> Guest8647 yeah so $COLUMNS is how many spaces I want to print, but how can I do that in PS1?

[08:18:36] <zulc22> but if its just the desktop and not much else for sure that makes some sense

[11:49:51] <hexnewbie> Firefox Quantum basically killed Seamonkey. They updated to the new Firefox code, but halfway, killing many old extensions, while not supporting the new ones that replace them, same with new browser features that Seamonkey doesn't support despite updating the underlying Firefox code. And it also killed the main reason for using Seamonkey in the first place: Firefox being extremely slow
[11:50:30] <hexnewbie> Now Seamonkey is slow too, and the new combination is slower still,  randomly using 100% CPU and such
[11:51:00] <hexnewbie> Well, over X2Go I still think it is way ahead of Firefox, but mainly because Firefox also got slower
[11:53:22] <blackgatonegro> hexnewbie only real reason to still use seamonkey is if you have a 32 bit system... Otherwise yeah. At least is not Midori.

And instead of trying the  NAT from one of the VMs, you're trying to simulate that with a ping from the host?

In the docs it mentions that kernels before 4.18 need existing pre-/postrouting chains, even if empty for it to work, but I checked and since I'm running 4.19 that shouldn't affect me.

[22:10:34] <Guest94830> I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're refering to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.
[22:10:34] <Guest94830> Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called Linux, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.
[22:10:34] <Guest94830> There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination
[22:10:39] <Guest94830> with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called Linux distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux!

[23:42:50] <epistax> I agree, but I can't touch sudoers at work. Policy.
[23:43:06] <Dagmar> So, a lack of qualified personnel
[23:43:22] <epistax> I'm willing to agree to that
[23:43:36] <Dagmar> You, as a mere user, should never be touching the sudoers file.
