[08:56:33] <rawktucc> i just clobbered a bunch of files I have no backups for
[08:57:26] <Hydragyrum> yikes
[08:57:44] <Hydragyrum> is it stuff you can recreate/reacquire reasonably?
[08:58:04] <rawktucc> i dont think so
[08:58:12] <Hydragyrum> double ouch
[08:58:12] <rawktucc> im not sure it was important either. im doing a bit cleanup of my data
[08:58:24] <rawktucc> im trying to repair it with snapraid but it keeps pooping out saying "NOTHING TO DO, BYE"
[08:58:34] <Hydragyrum> is it on spinning rust?
[08:58:36] <rawktucc> yes
[08:58:56] <rawktucc> the file is there, it's just been modified in a way that the file is unreadable now
[08:59:06] <rawktucc> so doing a ddrescue won't help in this case
[08:59:34] <Hydragyrum> yeah, but it's still there, so if you're willing to do a lot of work you *can* find it (photorec?)
[08:59:45] <rawktucc> but the file is there, that's what i mean
[08:59:52] <rawktucc> im just not sure how photorec would recover it
[09:09:30] <rawktucc> Nope, snapraid won't fix it
[09:09:36] <rawktucc> looks like I fucked up again
[09:20:29] <rawktucc> i forget who in here wanted it, but I finally managed to get Zoo Tycoon working in an XP VM
[09:26:45] <rawktucc> sooo turns out snapraid was somehow not backing up this specific folder the file exists it. it doesn't even know this file exists
[09:27:07] <rawktucc> im not sure how that happened but if only snapraid worked last week and didn't complain about being "out of space" despite having 2TB, I might be able to recover this file
[09:27:11] <rawktucc> so in effect, I did not test my backups

[19:54:14] <skye0> i'm in the UK so things are a little fairer but my job, even without feeling inferior to a colleague, there doesn't seem to be much for me to look forward to with it
[19:54:17] <skye0> except the paycheck
[19:55:05] <skye0> other people in my role and pay band just want more pay and/or a different job, but usually more pay first. since i'm living with parents for free i don't have to worry about pay yet
[19:55:48] <x10> so wrong
[19:56:26] <x10> if you live at home free, NOW is the time to build up capital
[19:57:32] <x10> when i lived at home, also for free, for a few years i put 1500euro away per month
[19:58:04] <x10> you'll need that later, really really perfect setup to let that grow if you live at home for free
[19:58:21] <evilgohan2> skye0: I was referring to what superkuh said
[19:58:36] <x10> you always haveto worry about pay
[19:58:36] <evilgohan2> [11:26:26] <x10> if you live at home free, NOW is the time to build up capital <--- CORRECT
[19:58:54] <skye0> ah
[19:58:57] <x10> your parents are giving you a huge boost in life right now
[19:59:19] <skye0> should save up, yeah
[19:59:24] <evilgohan2> Do you know how much money I saved (on a markedly lower income) because I had significantly lower living expenses when I lived at home?
[19:59:26] <evilgohan2> My goodness.
[19:59:32] <evilgohan2> Save your money and get paid.
[19:59:44] <skye0> but i really want to just have fun. don't feel like i can be happy these days. being a bit more careful with my money but i could have started saving sooner

[20:01:02] <skye0> this colleague i've heard only has slightly higher pay than i do (which still isn't much, I think around 20k GBP a year at minimum), and another colleague commented on why they didn't consider pursuing a higher paying job considering they've been working for it for like a year or so
