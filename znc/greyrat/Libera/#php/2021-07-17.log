[01:23:21] <kittonian> i'm now compiling 7.4.8 with the one extra option I need which is the --with-ldap config and we'll see if that breaks it again

[01:28:31] <Sammitch> I mean, the only bug report you linked to is notably not attached to the PHP project at all, so saying "it's been around for 4+ years" doesn't necessarily mean that it's been on the radar of actual PHP devs for any portion of that time

[01:36:21] <Byteflux> Perhaps something environment-related. I'm skeptical that it's a PHP issue, or if it is, I'd guess it's not very common. I'd be interested to see if you could produce a simple example of the issue that could be tested in other environments with the same version of Apache/mod_php.
[01:37:06] <Byteflux> If you could, I'd easily be able to test it in a single Docker command.
[01:37:23] <Sammitch> I've skimmed the scrollback and poked at the links, and it seems like they're compiling this on some flavor of ARM for an embedded system?

[01:38:30] <kittonian> it's just a standard debian box

[02:06:46] <zro> actually, I only need the setlocale line (4)
[02:07:35] <celphi> Any suggestions for php tables
[02:07:42] <celphi> html tables rather
[02:08:27] <zro> celphi: arrays and loops?
[02:08:57] <celphi> no - -i mean for dynamic html tables is there something already out there or i have to build it manually
[02:09:12] <celphi> <table>... sucks for mobile
[02:09:37] <celphi> or maybe hoping php class out there doees it for me
[02:10:06] <zro> does which tho? sounds like yr asking for a css solution to make tables responsive, not a php question. or maybe im misunderstanding
[02:11:57] <celphi> im talking about making a table that dynamic resizes cells based on width of characters
[02:12:27] <celphi> the output is from server so maybe the php class modifies the class name based on strlen i dont know
[02:13:09] <zro> i guess you could do that, but it doesnt sounds like a good solution to me
[02:13:26] <celphi> suggestions?
[02:14:13] <zro> id think u just output a table and style it w css as normal. but yr saying u dont know which columns will need to be which widths?
[02:14:43] <celphi> right
[02:14:49] <zro> i feel like u gotta have some idea of the type of data that will be in each colun, otherwise, how is it even a table?
[02:14:52] <celphi> so it cant just be a pure css solution
[02:15:09] <celphi> bc headers come from database -> html
[02:15:26] <celphi> headers can be dynamic based on what user selects to show/hide
[02:15:58] <celphi> i mean i can come up with a solution- im just wondering if theres somethign already out there
[02:16:10] <zro> dunno anything off top of my head
[02:16:51] <Byteflux> you should be using a responsive CSS framework. making things work nicely in desktop and mobile is a problem that was solved a long time ago and it doesn't involve PHP/the server
[02:16:57] *** Quits: stenno (~stenno@user/stenno) (Ping timeout: 255 seconds)
[02:17:52] <celphi> Byteflux: you cant use a pure css solution on dynamically sized headers
[02:18:40] <Blondie101010> show/hide options do not belong in PHP
[02:18:59] <celphi> if one column is 10px wide and the one next to it is 80px wide and it can change based on columns they wish to see, something on server (using php) has to modify the class
[02:19:14] <Blondie101010> no
[02:19:15] <celphi> *classname
[02:19:19] <Byteflux> no, this is 100% css
[02:19:27] <Sammitch> ^
[02:19:31] <zro> i tend to agree
[02:19:32] <Blondie101010> well it could involve JS but never PHP
[02:19:43] <celphi> how do you figure 100% css?
[02:20:12] <Sammitch> https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_intro.asp
[02:20:22] <zro> i mean, at best it sounds like yr trying to calculate stylistic information serverside and inject it into the html, eg class="wide-column" which is still wrong
[02:20:42] <Byteflux> you're saying that because some columns are wider than others, if a user hides a column, you have to recalculate the total column widths, but this is entirely doable in CSS.
[02:20:56] <celphi> im familiar with media queries
[02:21:05] <celphi> but you're not understanding my problem
[02:21:24] <celphi> yes zro
[02:21:40] <celphi> that is only way im aware of how you can do it
[02:22:34] <zro> and you're saying that this data is completely and totally arbitrary?
[02:22:41] <celphi> Byteflux: the columns are all variable width and dynamically changing based on width of text.
[02:23:00] <celphi> zro it's based on whatever is in database yes (columns the user creates)
[02:24:09] <Blondie101010> I can imagine some scenarios where you'd have problems like you're concerned about, but they all imply a bad layout
[02:24:27] <Blondie101010> ughhh, well letting the user choose their layout is their responsibility
[02:24:45] <Sammitch> the only thing that PHP should be even tangentially involved in is "how much text gets output" _everything_ else relating to how that that gets displayed is the job of CSS and maybe JS
[02:25:47] <Sammitch> doing pixel math for layout in php is a code smell akin to driving past the dump on a hot day
[02:25:55] <celphi> ie. if a user created fields "name" "description" "time" "deleted" and there was teh ability to change order on a settings page, or hide a column all together., so im thinking i create an array with each letter with each value evaluating to a px length., then when php echos the html inside the classname attribute it echos the px width
[02:26:09] <Byteflux> right, php should never be involved in deciding what kind of stylistic properties are associated with your layout elements (it shouldn't ever know that a column has to be "wide" or some specific width or pixel size)
[02:26:11] *** Joins: shailangsa (~shailangs@host86-186-196-229.range86-186.btcentralplus.com)
[02:27:05] <zro> honestly, that goes for html as well. that output should be semantic and meaningful, not stylistic
[02:28:02] <Sammitch> celphi: whatever value you calculate will differ between browsers, and even between different versions of the same browser, and between user preferences in different instance of the exact same browser
[02:28:08] <Sammitch> again, this is CSS's job.
[02:28:52] <celphi> you cant- with css you have to state beforehand the size and the columns may move
[02:28:53] <Sammitch> we all hate doing layouts and pissing about with the box model, but this is CSS's job.
[02:29:45] <zro> celphi: i have no idea whatyr data looks like, but u can prolly do something w flex
[02:30:01] <celphi> flex still requires width
[02:30:49] <Byteflux> CSS is perfectly capable of fluidity
[02:31:00] <celphi> yes but not in this situation
[02:31:01] <zro> anybody an i18n master or something? i have a bunch of questions and no real place to ask them as its not specifically php related. I guess maybe #web ?
[02:31:03] <Blondie101010> not of doing miracles, but neither is PHP
[02:31:33] <Blondie101010> zro:  tbh you'll probably need to pay the big price to get help with that
[02:31:39] <celphi> sorry didnt mean to go off topic i was mainly wondering if there were a class that did it already
[02:31:47] <celphi> im going to take that as a no
[02:31:53] <celphi> i appreciate teh replies
[02:31:56] <Byteflux> I can't think of such a class because nobody does it because it is unnecessary
[02:33:13] <celphi> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/Ik2yEkJo/image.png
[02:33:59] <celphi> image you wanted "level" to be smaller width and score and reports and wanted to be able to fit more columns on page... and then move those columns from 5th column to first
[02:34:28] <celphi> in css you'd have to state in beginning which one to be what size
[02:35:09] <celphi> but when echoing the html inside the classname="small" the css could then make a small cell
[02:35:39] <Byteflux> Or you could just tell it to only occupy as much width as it needs without explicitly saying what size it is.
[02:36:15] <celphi> then Byteflux all your cells be the same size of your largest one
[02:36:34] <celphi> which means level would be this huge cell wasting room
[02:36:55] <Blondie101010> celphi:  there's no way PHP can make this better
[02:37:07] <Byteflux> Not really. You assume that you have to stretch your whole table to fit the entire page/layout width, but you don't.
[02:37:17] <Blondie101010> just consider this as a big NO and real options will start to appear
[02:37:49] <celphi> Byteflux: there's like 30 different options to have as headers
[02:37:55] <celphi> this is only 6
[02:38:15] <zro> wait, but there's only 30?
[02:38:17] <celphi> if a user wanted more and now waste all that whitespace you cant make them all same width
[02:38:23] <zro> so it's NOT arbitrary?
[02:38:31] <celphi> it is  i was giving example
[02:39:02] <Blondie101010> users can select 30 large fields
[02:39:08] <zro> if you know the data type of a column, I see no problem injecting some indicator of that and using that for style
[02:39:08] <celphi> imagine if you had a  CRM where the user got to choose the column names
[02:39:16] <Blondie101010> how can that show up nicely on a mobile phone?
[02:39:27] <Byteflux> The more I read about this the more I'm convinced this is a CSS issue.
[02:39:39] <Blondie101010> the problem is in the (lack of) logic behind your expectation that the users can magically get a good presentation
[02:39:47] <celphi> it's all good man,. my main question was answered.
[02:40:04] <celphi> the mobile presentation is different
[02:40:11] <Blondie101010> anyone that tries to get a bad looking output probably will
[02:40:18] <celphi> im talking about maximizing white space on desktop view
[02:40:20] <Blondie101010> whatever solution you choose
[02:40:30] <Blondie101010> do that in JS and CSS
[02:41:01] <Byteflux> You say that if you only have 5 columns and make the width auto, that all the columns will be super wide. This shows me that you haven't explored all the CSS options. If your table/grid isn't 100% width, then your columns won't be wide.
[02:41:29] <celphi> you must have missed my earlier comment
[02:41:43] <celphi> im very good with css and im telling you this is not css issue
[02:41:48] <Blondie101010> yeah but there's no generic way to save white space...  imagine they choose the 6 shortest columns
[02:42:08] <celphi> yes then on server side those 6 columns would have classname="small"
[02:42:17] <celphi> then the css would make those columns small
[02:42:23] <Blondie101010> do you know that JS can change the class?
[02:42:33] <celphi> yes i program in js
[02:42:43] <Blondie101010> I don't think that's necessary but definitely a better option
[02:42:46] <Blondie101010> it doesn't show
[02:42:52] <Blondie101010> do it in JS/CSS
[02:42:53] <celphi> but resizing in js no no

[21:53:18] <Blondie101010> celphi:  this is a community help channel, not a direct support number to your consultant
[21:53:34] <Blondie101010> so if you have a question, just ask it
[21:53:50] <celphi> Blondie101010: yes, it's just that he specifically helped me with something the other day and i wanted to ask him specifically about it
[21:54:05] <Blondie101010> I get that, and my point still applies
[21:54:31] <celphi> I was using mod_rewrite rules and he suggested to me to use FallbackResource, however when i do there appears to be a bug.
[21:54:55] <Blondie101010> then refer to your sysadmin, or webserver support
[21:55:05] <Blondie101010> hmmmm actually
[21:55:08] <Blondie101010> what is the bug?
[21:55:10] <celphi> That's why i wanted to ask him specifically
[21:55:15] *** Joins: JonBardo (~Jonathan@137.100.18.95.dynamic.jazztel.es)
[21:55:24] <JonBardo> hi
[21:55:27] <Blondie101010> if it's the webserver config, the answer I just gave applies
[21:55:35] <Blondie101010> but what is your bug celphi?
[21:55:43] <Blondie101010> JonBardo: !+hi
[21:55:43] <php-bot> JonBardo, Hi there!
[21:55:45] <celphi> If i do `a.php` i get 404, but if i do `/blah/a.php` it works right by going to index.php
[21:56:01] <Blondie101010> celphi:  ok so yeah, webserver support it is
[21:56:17] <celphi> https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=52403
[21:56:23] <celphi> explains the bug perfectly
[21:56:58] <Blondie101010> not a PHP problem
[21:57:08] <celphi> yes i get that- that's why i pinged him
[21:57:14] <Blondie101010> and honestly it is not a bug but a webserver misconfiguration
[21:57:25] <Blondie101010> celphi:  he is not your consultant
[21:58:25] <Blondie101010> we sometimes give general advice on how you should set up your webserver, but it doesn't make it on topic
[21:58:50] <celphi> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/eZ1qrlLY/image.png
[21:59:11] <Blondie101010> yeah I was there in that never ending discussion
[21:59:12] *** Joins: TanoMarcelo (~TanoMarce@179.63.242.126)
[21:59:23] <Blondie101010> and that matches what I was saying
[21:59:45] <Blondie101010> you were given advice to use that, but it's YOUR responsibility to figure out how to do it exactly
[21:59:55] <celphi> ok thank you Blondie101010
[22:00:23] <JonBardo> Hi, I'm not a php developer, but I was doing a ctf and found out this works as a way to place the output of a function inside a string and I tried to find why it works that way, but couldn't
[22:00:26] <Blondie101010> #httpd
[22:00:42] <JonBardo> echo "{${system('whoami')}}";
[22:01:05] <celphi> use shell_exec
[22:01:20] <Blondie101010> that's not his question :)
[22:01:25] <JonBardo> can you explain why this works? on the interactive console it gives me a warning of undefined variable
[22:01:28] <Blondie101010> JonBardo:  sounds like output buffering
[22:01:40] <Blondie101010> or maybe not
[22:01:49] <Blondie101010> that line doesn't match your question
[22:02:00] <celphi> im familiar with what he's doing
[22:02:06] <celphi> CTF = capture the flag
[22:02:12] <Blondie101010> I know :)
[22:02:34] <JonBardo> sorry, I meant instead of "hello there" . system("whoami") . "!"
[22:02:34] <Blondie101010> the question was about getting the output from a function in a variable
[22:02:43] <Blondie101010> that line of code does nothing like that
[22:03:25] <Blondie101010> so I don't get the question
[22:03:31] <Blondie101010> show us the real challenge
[22:03:49] <celphi> I'm assuming he's trying to upload an image with php inserted into it and he wants to output that the php command actually has access to the linux filesystem
[22:04:00] <JonBardo> ok, the challenge is this one https://exploit.education/nebula/level-09/
[22:05:01] <celphi> those are just regex functions
[22:05:39] <Blondie101010> the intrusion is done through file_get_contents()
[22:05:53] <JonBardo> if i use it on a file that has [email {${system('whoami'}}] as content, it executes the whoami command
[22:06:14] <JonBardo> Blondie101010: no, the execution is done in the first preg_replace command
[22:06:36] <Blondie101010> preg_replace() only does string operations
[22:07:43] <JonBardo> but because of the "/regex/e" in the first argument it executes the second string, which has the matched group inside
[22:08:39] <Blondie101010> ahhh ok
[22:08:39] <JonBardo> so it would execute spam("{${system('whoami')}}") and replace it on $content
[22:09:28] *** Joins: Rockwood (~Rocky@user/rocky)
[22:09:55] <JonBardo> My doubt was just that i don't know what kind of syntax the {${function()}} part is using
[22:10:27] <Blondie101010> you can clarify that part with a few tests on your own installation
[22:10:39] <JonBardo> my first guess was just doing ${system('whoami'} because I'm not very familiar with php, but it doesn't work
[22:10:42] <Blondie101010> but the /e is deprecated (since I don't know when)
[22:13:57] <Blondie101010> JonBardo:  `${}` is used for variable interpolation inside a string
[22:14:33] <Blondie101010> so `echo "${system('whoami')}";` outputs a notice: PHP Notice:  Undefined variable: root ...
[22:14:47] <JonBardo> Blondie101010: yes, that part I understand, but I don't understand why the outer {} makes it work
[22:16:15] <Blondie101010> I don't see it as making anything work, so I'm not following
[22:17:42] <Blondie101010> `echo "${system('whoami')}";` does exactly the same thing as `echo "{${system('whoami')}}}";`
[22:18:24] <JonBardo> Blondie101010: yes, for me too, but for some reason on the challenge without the outer {} it doesn't work
[22:18:57] <JonBardo> if i do echo "{${system('whoami')}} it gives me the same notice but prints it anyways
[22:19:14] <Blondie101010> if you want to know the cause of the CVE, you'd have to look at the relevant bug report and possibly commits
[22:19:26] <Blondie101010> no difference at all
[22:19:29] <Rockwood> lol
[22:19:53] <Blondie101010> but I can't say there was never a related bug, but as you said the challenge is focused on a bug with the regex /e
[22:20:04] <Blondie101010> which is now deprecated for security reasons
[22:20:36] <Rockwood> XD
[22:21:42] <JonBardo> Blondie101010: yes, I just got stuck wanting to know what the outside brackets meant hahaha
[22:22:58] <Rockwood> JonBardo, you have to see in code everything careful
[22:23:04] <Rockwood> nothing
[22:23:14] <Rockwood> take a breath

[22:28:27] <Rockwood> sorry abt it
[22:29:19] <JonBardo> Rockwood: yep, anyways I have to learn php, will put on my todo list
[22:30:07] <Blondie101010> JonBardo:  so far you don't sound too bad, but CTF is not a way to learn programming
[22:30:23] <__adrian> ^
[22:30:32] <__adrian> CTFs are objectively useless
[22:30:45] <Blondie101010> I wouldn't say that though :)
[22:30:55] <__adrian> maybe you'll have fun doing it, so that's cool
[22:30:59] <Blondie101010> they can give insight on bad ideas/code
[22:31:05] <stenno> ctfs are great fun and they put awareness on security issues of the languages
[22:31:10] <stenno> yes that
[22:31:26] <stenno> i learned a lot of really strange stuff about php when i did some casual wargamingj
[22:32:39] <JonBardo> Blondie101010: I know, I know other languages but never got to php, will do
[22:33:00] <JonBardo> __adrian: well, I think they are fun
[22:33:07] <stenno> and a lot of fundamental stuff too, for example what exactly happens in string interpolation
[22:33:14] <__adrian> and I said, that's cool  :)
[22:33:37] <stenno> code golfing is similar btw
[22:34:00] <stenno> code golfing feels like a combination of demoscene and wargaming
[22:35:08] <stenno> and its (hopefully) stuff you will never use in production, but you can still derive insight from it, and it also forces you to explore a problem at a totally different angle than usual
[22:35:19] <Blondie101010> it depends on the purpose of the code golf
[22:35:34] <Blondie101010> if it's to make the shortest code, then it's always bad
[22:35:45] <stenno> wut?
[22:35:58] <Blondie101010> condensing code does not make it better
[22:36:02] <stenno> no, not at all
[22:36:16] <stenno> who claimed that? thats stupuid
[22:36:19] <Blondie101010> but exchanging ideas is good
[22:36:47] <stenno> code golfing is as bad as ctf
[22:36:48] <Blondie101010> that's the most common style of code golfing
[22:36:53] <stenno> thats what you mean with bad, i guess
[22:38:00] <JonBardo> i still think some ctfs are worth it
[22:38:19] <stenno> me
[22:38:19] <Rockwood> idk
[22:38:21] <stenno> too
[22:38:33] <Rockwood> XD
[22:38:34] <stenno> ctf are worth it, and code golfing is also worth it
[22:38:46] <stenno> even though it wont result in something you will directly use in production
[22:38:57] <JonBardo> maybe the more general ones where you always repeat some steps not really based on real cases not, but for reverse engineering its really the only way I found to learn and practice a bit
[22:39:10] <stenno> 'code golfing' is not a coding style lmao
[22:39:14] <__adrian> if you get something from it, even if just enjoyment and brain-streching, that's cool
[22:39:57] <stenno> it was so weird, after wargaming for a few days, i looked at a certain project that was hosted on a public server i knew
[22:40:00] <stenno> and its ancient php
[22:40:07] <__adrian> that's not weird  ;)
[22:40:14] <Rockwood> __adrian, hi how are you sir?
[22:40:18] <__adrian> hi
[22:40:21] <stenno> and it somehow felt as if the codebase was specifically set up for wargaming
[22:40:43] <stenno> so i exploited the hell out of the system, and was writing stuff to the admins like 'i know what this is about' and stuff
[22:40:48] <__adrian> likely because a lot of php is sloppily written
[22:40:52] <Rockwood> __adrian, one of good is dead really sad
[22:41:08] <stenno> and i think in the end it turned out that it was not on purpose, but just terribly written code
[22:41:19] <stenno> but it was so terrible that it appeared to be on purpose
[22:41:24] <__adrian> yeah, php has a very low barrier to entry
[22:41:24] <stenno> hanlons razor i guess
[22:41:41] <Rockwood> __adrian, thanks sir
[22:41:49] <__adrian> so you get people writing a lot of code that happens to do what they want, given the right circumstances
[22:41:54] <Rockwood> i am going to sleep soon
[22:41:58] <Blondie101010> stenno:  did they reply?
[22:41:58] <__adrian> but is really really bad
[22:42:02] <Rockwood> i am tired
[22:42:06] <stenno> Blondie101010: no
[22:42:14] <Blondie101010> unsurprisingly :)
[22:42:14] <__adrian> ok?  goodnight
[22:42:27] <stenno> Blondie101010: i then informed then about the security holes i found but they still ignored me and were like 'just make a PR'
[22:42:43] <stenno> and before i'd make that PR, i'd re-write it from scratch, which i really don't want to
[22:42:45] <JonBardo> Rockwood: goodnight!
[22:42:54] <stenno> but there are dozens of high-level security issues
[22:43:09] <Blondie101010> stenno:  then don't use that package
[22:43:13] <stenno> didn't find an arbitrary code execution yet but i am sure that its possible
[22:43:20] <stenno> yeah i don't
[22:43:21] <Rockwood> __adrian, yeah
[22:43:25] <stenno> its a quote database software
[22:44:07] <Blondie101010> if you're paying for it, ask a refund, otherwise just move on
[22:44:12] <stenno> but found sql injection, auth escalation, multiple SQL injection
[22:44:19] <stenno> i didn't pay for it
[22:44:25] <Blondie101010> just my point
[22:44:28] <__adrian> unfortunate, but not surprising
[22:44:41] <stenno> er i said sql injection twice
[22:44:46] <stenno> csrf
[22:44:53] <Rockwood> Blondie101010, __adrian is money everything? i know you both could be angry on me
[22:44:53] <__adrian> well i figured it happened twice
[22:44:56] <stenno> js injection, markup injection
[22:44:59] <stenno> .lol
[22:45:07] <__adrian> Rockwood: what?
[22:45:18] <Blondie101010> hmmm that's relevant, but not on topic
[22:45:42] <Rockwood> really money make differences
[22:45:45] <stenno> C.R.E.A.M as some wise person said once
[22:45:52] <Blondie101010> how can organizations get enough qualified people to do a proper job if those people don't have money to eat?
[22:46:34] <__adrian> blondie: collusion

[23:05:06] <BadAdviceCat> stenno, sheesh, seems like you can find the answer to the universe with a code base as bad as that, since you're virtually finding all kinds of exploits in there, lmao.
[23:05:46] <stenno> didn't find remote code execution yet which was the one i was really rooting for (no pun intented)
[23:05:55] <__adrian> hur hur
[23:06:03] <stenno> i am sure its hidden somewhere in the codebase but i get dizzy when i look at it for too long
[23:06:25] <Blondie101010> reporting security issues you observed when you attacked someone is almost as bad as not reporting them
[23:06:25] <stenno> remote code execution and by that shell access
[23:06:39] <stenno> Blondie101010: why do you think so? :)
[23:06:46] <Blondie101010> because you attacked them
[23:07:00] <Blondie101010> they are not in a situation where they should take your advice
[23:07:17] <stenno> oh gotcha
[23:07:20] <stenno> hmm
[23:07:28] <stenno> also they could sue me for it :P
[23:07:35] <Blondie101010> in some cases, yes
[23:07:47] <__adrian> yeah, whitehatting is hard
[23:08:18] <BadAdviceCat> LOL, I imagined this was about some random php lib hosted somewhere on github. :P
[23:08:25] <BadAdviceCat> Yikes.
[23:11:01] <stenno> this is all 'against' infrastructure of a community i am part of for a long time so we all know each other
[23:11:24] <__adrian> i wouldn't rely on that
[23:11:43] <stenno> no commercial thingies involved
[23:11:48] <__adrian> i wouldn't rely on that
[23:11:55] <stenno> i guess, i guess
[23:12:08] <stenno> i don't rely on it but i am really certain of it
[23:12:14] <stenno> those are people i know 10 years now
[23:12:26] <__adrian> now if you're in a position to legitimately install this crap and "find out" by attacking yourself, there you go
[23:12:27] <Blondie101010> is their package open source?
[23:12:37] <stenno> yes, its open source
[23:12:41] <__adrian> there you go
[23:12:43] <stenno> __adrian: sure, fair epoint
[23:12:45] <stenno> -e
[23:12:52] <stenno> could have just installed it myself
[23:12:58] * Blondie101010 nods
[23:13:05] <stenno> but don't forget that i had the idea of it being an actually wargame
[23:13:14] <stenno> i thought it was a wargame
[23:13:31] <Blondie101010> and if you cared about the project, you'd put as much effort in the PR as in the intrusion attempts
[23:13:33] *** Quits: zro (~zro@user/zro) (Quit: WeeChat 3.2)
[23:13:55] <stenno> writing a proper PR to fix all this mess is pearls before swines
[23:14:06] <stenno> re-writing from scratch is the proper solution
[23:14:35] <Blondie101010> well reporting a few bugs to let others know would be a good thing, but you have to just move on
[23:15:09] <stenno> well i did report the bugs
