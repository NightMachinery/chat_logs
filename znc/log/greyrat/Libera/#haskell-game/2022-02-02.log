[20:21:55] <f-a> https://leagueh.xyz/en/librejam/index.html I am going to partecipate(sp) in this, I think

[21:35:28] <EvanR> \o/
[21:36:38] <f-a> http://www.ariis.it/link/t/lj202202/ will keep a log to keep myself honest
[21:37:17] <EvanR> oh man... a live journal
[21:37:26] <EvanR> that's so brutal
[21:37:54] <f-a> brutal as in ‚Äúbrutalist‚Äù?
[21:38:13] <EvanR> how are you supposed to get side tracked by semi unrelated semi minutiae
[21:39:27] * f-a nods
[21:41:59] <EvanR> I have a lot of notes over the years, but they are scrambled in unorganized text files strew about various hdds and in notebooks, and the threads move from notebook to notebook randomly
[21:44:34] <f-a> I had that problem too, I decided to keep One True Notefile‚Ñ¢
[21:44:45] <f-a> f@mkiii:~/francesco/progetti/ariisit$ wc --lines $Cannocchiale
[21:44:45] <f-a> 50159 /home/f/francesco/progetti/tesauro/cannocchiale.txt
[21:45:31] <EvanR> üò≥
[21:46:53] <f-a> txt file, so if you need non-unicode math or complex graphs it is a bit of a problem
[21:47:06] <f-a> a friend of mine uses ikiwiki(sp) and seems fine to hiim
[21:49:08] <EvanR> do notes always go at the bottom or
[21:49:23] <EvanR> is there an index to get to particular places to continue in the middle
[21:50:15] <f-a> there is an index
[21:50:26] <f-a> each section stars with e.g.
[21:50:27] <f-a> ===============
[21:50:27] <EvanR> how does that work
[21:50:27] <f-a> kappa-akutagawa
[21:50:27] <f-a> ===============
[21:50:42] <f-a> so I can search by index, tags, text
[21:50:50] <EvanR> very interesting
[21:51:06] <f-a> I find it useful especially when I take notes on a topic with many ramifications
[21:53:02] <f-a> as you can see here (tw: Italian) http://www.ariis.it/link/t/paste3273628-0 I referenced [preimage] and [measurable-space]
[21:53:29] <f-a> I find it immensely easier than creating 10000 files and fetching a proper link
[21:53:35] <f-a> vim search is enough fornow
[21:54:14] <EvanR> unicode ftw
[21:54:23] <f-a> I do have a quite link .xcompose file
[21:54:34] <f-a> f@mkiii:~/francesco/progetti/ariisit$ wc --lines ~/.XCompose
[21:54:34] <f-a> 750 /home/f/.XCompose
[21:54:45] <f-a> useful for ‚Äúlinear‚Äù math and foreign languages
[21:55:17] <f-a> you feature in this snippet http://www.ariis.it/link/t/paste3288785-0
[21:55:32] <f-a> I recall that conversation, I learned a lot
[21:57:22] <EvanR> dang how long ago was that
[21:57:56] <EvanR> Dog vs Car what a terribble premise
[21:58:31] <EvanR> I guess frog vs car was more acceptable
[21:59:02] <f-a> Mon 25 Nov 2019 22:23:01 CET
[21:59:31] <f-a> (I keep a diary too, in the same file)
[21:59:52] <EvanR> so is librejam going to be a separate document
[22:00:12] <EvanR> or a projection from the One True Notefile
[22:00:17] <f-a> the *log*, since it is a public facing doc, yes
[22:00:28] <f-a> game notes, I hope to keep it  on paper as much as possible
[22:00:37] <f-a> failing that, OTN
[22:01:11] *** Quits: finsternis (~X@23.226.237.192) (Remote host closed the connection)
[22:01:37] <EvanR> OTN?
[22:01:42] <EvanR> oh
[22:01:59] <EvanR> acronym inference delay
[22:02:05] <EvanR> (AID)
[22:02:52] <f-a> haha sorry
[22:03:24] *** Joins: finsternis (~X@23.226.237.192)
[22:04:00] <f-a> called it Cannocchiale since the ideas are similar to this book https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emanuele_Tesauro#Il_cannocchiale_aristotelico (Wikipedia manages *not* to explain the technique)
[22:06:00] <EvanR> at least I learned what a Cannocchiale is
