[00:00:52] <mlu> that CS degree exposed me to a lot of topics, but they were all introductions only :)

[00:02:52] <Thuryn> You need to pick the right one for the career you aim forr.
[00:02:54] <Gustavo6046> but building new technology on the shoulders of old one can be a bad thing, lest we someday end up with a better substitute for said old technology but now we also need to put in the work to ALSO replace in the newer technology on top. Logistical inertia.
[00:02:58] <mlu> it was all the people I met, not the education in itself :)
[00:03:04] <Gustavo6046> mlu: good point
[00:03:18] <Gustavo6046> ananke: no, that'd be for boring bloggers, not me.
[00:03:19] <mlu> but if all you want is a career, a bootcamp will get you started much faster
[00:03:21] <Gustavo6046> I ain't no boring! :P
[00:03:25] <mlu> and yes, you'll suck at it for a while, but that's OK
[00:03:29] <TheGuestMovie> Americans always say that, none of the people from uni I'm still friends with, were in CS. All from other programs.
[00:03:38] <Thuryn> bootcamp doesn't give you the same breadth and depth of knowledge
[00:03:42] <ananke> Gustavo6046: knowing what NOT to do is very important. knowing what was done and failed is very valuable
[00:03:47] <TheGuestMovie> bootcamp gets you started then you learn on your own online
[00:03:53] <tsapien> Gustavo6046: yes, a balance is needed between re-inventing the wheel and just using legacy products
[00:04:03] <Gustavo6046> ananke: yes true, a study of history is important

[00:04:11] <Gustavo6046> about*
[00:04:12] <Thuryn> College is more about understanding the problems than understanding the solutions anyway.
[00:04:17] <Gustavo6046> Yeah
[00:04:18] <Thuryn> We reinvent the wheel CONSTANTLY
[00:04:21] <TheGuestMovie> you can skip the bootcamp if you're a self-learner like Gustavo, but you have to make sure you're not wasting time on non-optimal stuff (like 99% of what gustavo discusses here)
[00:04:30] <NakedKing> mlu, do you have any suggestion for bootcamp? there is lots of bootcampers
[00:04:33] <Thuryn> But that's okay.  Fuel injection replaces carbuetor.
[00:04:43] <tsapien> CS in general is a *science* thing. it's meant to teach principles and the science behind stuff more than practicalities
[00:04:44] <Thuryn> Same job:  Much better implementation.
[00:04:46] <Gustavo6046> TheGuestMovie: I'm doing a botting framework that abstracts over IRC, XMPP and Discord
[00:04:58] <Gustavo6046> It could be useful in the trades
[00:04:59] <tsapien> if you want practicalities bootcamps or open source education is vastly, vastly better

[00:19:29] <TheGuestMovie> NakedKing: basically it's rare for "junior backend developer" to get a job, because it's too important to trust a junior with. That's why I advise focusing on frontend, and when you get hired, you'll forcibly be collaborating with backend devs, so you'll have the contacts to get better and eventually get hired as backend/fullstack

[00:28:13] <TheGuestMovie> Gustavo6046: well the frontend is using the client's CPU/RAM, so your server isn't feeling the effects. If you're talking about making too many requests, that's something a junior can fix.
[00:28:14] <rasta> Firefox will gladly let the user decide, Chrome will just block without warning whatsoever

[00:34:16] <TheGuestMovie> tsapien: sure, but no one wants to give a junior backend dev 2 years. You're expected to have learned that stuff in your spare time and be almost work-ready. That's why I told NakedKing to start with frontend, which will put him in touch with the backend devs for which he's implementing the frontend, which means he has people to learn from and that
[00:34:17] <TheGuestMovie> might give him supervised work if they see he's not just some clueless frontend dev
[00:34:36] <Gustavo6046> TheGuestMovie: backend isn't too difficult once you get the database and all the other server software installed and configured, you can write your own server stuff for custom things (which varies depending on the specific use-case - e.g. a massively multiplayer online game's server IS said custom code) and for other miscellaneous integration.
[00:34:43] <Gustavo6046> Is this correct?
[00:34:58] <silver> backend is easiest to break into via infra support

[00:37:12] <TheGuestMovie> you can get Hello World up and running quickly, but unlike frontend, as soon as you have many concurrent users, unoptimized systems will make you suffer. And if sometimes goes down, you gotta be able to troubleshoot and fix on your own.
[00:37:15] <Gustavo6046> TheGuestMovie: that is true, but that's often just a matter of configuration. As for designing the tables in your database, that isn't rocket science either, depending on what you're managing. You can use indexing to make it way faster. Just try to make multiple queries instead of constructing single-statement monster queries. It's called *Relational* Database for a reason – make as many tables as
[00:37:17] <Gustavo6046> you can if that means data access is nicer :)
[00:37:51] <TheGuestMovie> meanwhile, a frontend dev goes "webrequest goes brrr"
[00:38:08] <Gustavo6046> I'm all in for optimization. Gimme the tools and I will give you software design that is vectorizable, makes good use of the CPU cache, and makes good use of parallel computation (threads).
[00:38:16] <TheGuestMovie> and unless the backend guy yells at you for hammering the server, you dont need to fix anything
[00:38:46] <Gustavo6046> A lot of words and I sound like a salesman don't I lol.
[00:38:48] <silver> remember: hardware is cheaper than better code
[00:38:50] <silver> :p
[00:38:54] <Gustavo6046> I mean, workers are basically salesmen, trying to sell their own words.

[00:39:18] <Gustavo6046> If better code is expensive them that's what I'm gonna sell. Good code. :)
[00:39:20] <TheGuestMovie> Don't think CPU cache comes into it on backend services. More like actual caches, like a Redis or Memcache DB.

[00:55:43] <Gustavo6046> It has nothing to do with communism, too
[00:55:49] <Gustavo6046> So I dunno why you lump up communism with furries and gender fluidity
[00:56:01] <TheGuestMovie> They sorta blended those 2 identities into a combined one
[00:56:03] <Gustavo6046> That's all the stereotypes of the left that the right often tosses around to label them as mentally ill

[00:56:46] <Gustavo6046> I'm a he, and I feel that way too so I don't think I'm transitioning anytime
[00:56:47] <CompanionCube> Gustavo6046: falling for it would imply there existed a time when they didn't.
[00:57:00] <jackiee> im certainly on board with the notion that much of the "deep-into-twitter" gender bendy culture reaks of social estrangement. but im kind of shrug on it i think its a product of alienation in a society where every interaction between humans has a dollar sign slapped on it. And the gender bending itself is harmless and maybe good for being prudish about cultural roles idk
[00:57:31] <silver> seems unreasonable to expect hackers not to hack
[00:57:33] <Caffeinated> gender confusion is the new way of getting attention nowadays
[00:57:37] <Gustavo6046> jackiee: yeah, people often affix a lot of expectations into what constitutes "a good man" and what constitutes "a good woman" and like, I'm just trying to grill for God's sakes.
[00:57:39] <TheGuestMovie> Anyway, let's pour some Henny for a dead homie who should have known better. Hope you're writing accurate emulators in heaven, byuu.
[00:57:49] <Gustavo6046> Yup
[00:58:08] <Gustavo6046> TheGuestMovie: I can be a communist AND a talented worker with a high-pay position in capitalist business.
[00:58:32] <Gustavo6046> That is, I can have different thoughts of what is ideal (maybe utopic, maybe not) versus what I do in practice.
[00:58:33] <silver> loooooool I just realized all my logic is wrong becuause the laser signal is normally on!
[00:58:43] <TheGuestMovie> there's nothing specifically wrong with having communist ideals, all kids go through this phase. It's hanging out with the sort of people who identify as communists.
[00:58:46] <Gustavo6046> Because the latter is fettered by real life circumstances, not of world or society, but of me.
[00:59:04] <silver> and because the laser is always tripped, my detected object is suuuuuper loooooong
[00:59:09] <Gustavo6046> TheGuestMovie: well, what do you think of Karl Marx?
[00:59:15] <jackiee> clowns to the left of me. jokers to the right.here i am. hitting the grillpill w/ u
[00:59:15] <Gustavo6046> He, like, predicted the course of capitalism up until the 1930s.
[00:59:27] <silver> so now I've got a 10 meter long fish on my desk according to this thing
[00:59:29] <TheGuestMovie> I don't
[00:59:30] <Gustavo6046> Then his prediction broke down when all the communist countries implemented authoritarian planned economies.
[01:00:03] <Gustavo6046> Karl Marx was intelligent as fuck, but people took him as Nostradamus and used that to be so closed-minded (as if everything was already figured out) that they became authoritarian.

[01:01:08] <Gustavo6046> Almost every example of "communism failing" is a nation which has been placed either in heavily unfair circumstances or predicaments. The Soviet Union started as a backwards rural monarchy and what impresses is the SPEED it got up to the Space Age, in spite of the means. Cuba may be poor and have constant US embargos but it doesn't have homelessness.

[01:01:25] <Gustavo6046> The authoritarianism is kind of a necessity because otherwise the foreign influence is overpowering.
[01:01:35] <Gustavo6046> TheGuestMovie: no, but rather that it's never been given a fair chance.
[01:01:36] <jackiee> Marx absolutely makes Adam Smith look like a bitch in Ch. 24 of Das Kapital where he deconstructs Smith's account of "original accumulation" pretending that enclosure and the commodification of the common lands had nothing to do with the origins of wage slavery
[01:01:38] <tar_xvf> when communism fails it's because of outside circumstances but everything wrong with america is due to captalism

[01:31:29] <jackiee> can somebody provide a succinct explanation of portage  use flags in gentoo. Im not too familiar with gentoo. im trying to expand my linux knowledge and ive learned a ton from using Arch btw
[01:31:33] <jackiee> for the past year
[01:31:46] <kapaun2> How can I make certain applications open links, emails, and files in another specific application without changing defaults?
[01:31:55] <jackiee> but are portage use flags like sockets but for specific packages within their own atmosphere
[01:31:58] <jackiee> ?
[01:32:00] <jackiee> or am i misunderstanding?
[01:32:35] <kapaun2> Does xdg-open have some setting to at least detect what program is asking it to open something?
[01:32:47] <kapaun2> so I can write a solution myself if it doesn't already exist
[01:33:31] <jackiee> is there a gentoo channel?

[01:57:43] <themachine> jackiee: debian doesn't hold your hand nearly as much as other more desktop user oriented distros
[01:57:53] <themachine> like Mint, ubuntu, ect.
[01:58:45] <themachine> There is also the issue of it's age + the age of your hardware. If you are using very new hardware there is a potential to run into some issues that the "average" user might not understand
[01:58:52] <jackiee> yeah but is it really much harder than windows? I honestly think much of peoples struggle using linux comes from the windows conditioning. Which is fine if someone wants to use windows thats fine. But I feel like windows overcomplicates things. Studies show older people actually find Linux much more intuitive
[01:58:56] <themachine> by it's age I mean it's packages
[01:59:20] <themachine> is it hard to USE? No I don't think so assuming everything works.

[04:21:58] <tsapien> a possibly better way to determine what the file actually is, regardless of extension or lack thereof is to run file <filename> and parse that output conditionally to do whatever you want

[04:34:57] <mlu> that thing is good enough for a gernal purpose project where you want to encourage community participation, but anything non-trivial will get hard
[04:35:07] <ayecee> jcbjoe2021: doesn't really change anything though. just means Sauvin will give Sauvin a stern talk
[04:35:17] <phogg> mlu: I believe gitlab is better in that regard
[04:35:24] <mlu> right, but there's no way to reconcile the pull request itself since those are explicitly tied to the commits themselves
[04:35:35] <mlu> phogg: not significatly :)
[04:35:48] <kurahaupo> phogg: I often find illogic worms in such corners, feeding off persistence gnats
[04:35:52] <mlu> phogg: put it this way: they have a few neat features, and I generally find it a nice tool to use within my org
[04:35:59] <Sauvin> jcbjoe2021, what kinds of errors do you get when you try to view the files with mpv?
[04:36:10] <mlu> but then again, my org is much simpler than linux kernel development
[04:36:17] <mlu> we have less coders than Linux has reviewers
[04:36:18] <ayecee> kurahaupo: persistence gnats will be my band name
[04:36:52] <rascul> how many reviewers does linux have?
[04:36:56] <phogg> mlu: I can only speculate since I only do trivial amounts of work with either gitlab or github in the real world. Off in my little corner everything is upside down and backwards. Still, gitlabs tools are nicer.
[04:37:07] <mlu> totally agree
[04:37:14] <rascul> gitlab is more opensourcier
[04:37:33] <xx> rascul: at least 1
[04:37:37] <mlu> if I was to use Github.com for anything in the future, I'd just disable pull requests and do everything with git directly
[04:37:41] <rascul> xx hopefully
[04:38:10] <mlu> gitlab has a few more options in terms of mangaging reviewers, rebase before merge, etc.

[04:41:03] <phogg> mlu: I heard that, too, but I gave up trying to actually install it
[04:41:03] <mlu> too bad they were SVN first instead of some dCVS-first in design
[04:41:16] <mlu> oh yeah, admining an actaul Phabricator instance is a nightmare
[04:41:31] <mlu> at the end of the day, I preferred Gitlab after trying both Phabricator and Gitlab

[04:45:15] <noobly> if i want to make a windows bootable drive from an iso, can i recycle the same command I'd use for making a linux bootable drive (using dd)?
[04:45:53] <phogg> noobly: I've no idea, but my hunch is no (Windows is considerably less forgiving where boot is concerned).
[04:46:34] <phogg> Linux distros have put *considerable* engineering effort into boot process, whereas Microsoft really hasn't. The former needed to, the latter didn't.

[06:18:47] <zdragon> in the old days, like 80's and early 90's, hardware manufacturers were hardware manufacturers and provided documentation and datasheets, no NDAs or shit like that.

[06:20:39] <doctor_who> I liked sysv better
[06:20:50] <No1x3r0> doctor_who that's what I mean, some freedoms are suppressed by design like mixing debian repos with ubuntu repos etc.

[13:47:55] <kuhilas> I have got an external disk 1.8T with partition of same size when I check lsblk and fdisk -l. I need to move a windows game installation to this disk, but windows doesn't recognize the disk, I guess because it's ext4 or so. I has over 700G free. Can I shrink this partition by 500G and then create another ntfs partition of size 500G and if yes, what should be a safe tool to do it?

[15:13:13] <bailsman> I've put an ext4 partition on a virtual disk /dev/sdb. I've resized that disk now, can I online resize it with resize2fs /dev/sdb while the filesystem is in use? I know this works if it's on a partition, so I don't see any reason for why it shouldn't, but maybe I'm missing something.
[15:13:15] <peac> xx: afair start does not create a new container definition, it would be podman run
[15:13:38] <peac> xx: also if you come from docker you may find it convenient to use podman's equivalent to docker-compose
[15:13:40] <bailsman> Sorry I meant put an ext4 *filesystem* using the full disk /dev/sdb, no partitoin.
[15:13:47] <xx> peac: yes, `podman run` would work, but I don't want to create a new container, because I already have a nicely configured container created from an image.

[15:14:17] <bailsman> I've resized the virtual disk already and rescanned, and the kernel sees the new size. I now want to update the filesystem. I've done this successfully before with the filesystem on a partition.
[15:14:40] <peac> xx: afaik you can't modify the configuration of a container, at least for the ports
[15:15:06] <peac> compose files and persisting storage would be the way to go
[15:15:20] <xx> peac: you might be right but it is hard to believe. So if someone later realizes that they need to redirect an extra port, they need to rebuild the entire container from image again?

[17:39:08] <marlinc> Dagmar well, when you pass a Ethernet PCI device to a VM it gets removed from the host as they can't use it at the same time.

[19:07:17] <ayecee> it's not something i've ever checked
[19:07:23] <Dagmar> Paying attention to this sort of thing is actually somewhat important, as site after site keeps learning hte hard way what happens when their SSL cert expires because no one was paying attention
[19:07:24] <stwange> Dagmar, it has a valid chain that openssl 1.0.1 doesn't honour because it sees an expired cert. So no, I didn't know a year in advance
[19:07:31] <johnjay> once the day passes would it be impossible to update the new cert?
[19:07:35] <stwange> The SSL hasn't expired
[19:07:35] <johnjay> because... you have no cert?

[19:13:59] <hexnewbie> I didn't want to bother working overtime to update the CA store, so I just did apt-get upgrade. But *was* planning to go that way, if a simple upgrade did not provide a magic solution, except.. tomorrow
[19:14:43] <ayecee> "older versions of OpenSSL will reject a certificate chain that includes a signature by an expired root, even if OpenSSL could validate the chain by ignoring that certificate."
[19:14:54] <djph> angular_mike_: why would the display server be different?

[21:47:21] <kuhilas> i think i just messed up something. I dualboot win10 and linux. I wanted to shrink win partition but win disk mangement didnt allow me to shrink it as much as i want so i found on microsoft forums that 3rd party tool aomei will do it for me. Seemed safe and i decided to try. It created a windows pe environment and then booted there to do operation but there it said it noticed i wanted to shrink system partition or so and said it would boot to preOS
[21:47:21] <kuhilas> environment. There it started shrinking and after some minutes I guess it reached 100% or so and then I come check back screen and i see grub with colors inverted saying unknown file system and im at grub rescue. I try boot with ctrl alt del and i get the same grub screen. What should i do i wonder

[22:30:42] <kuhilas> I booted and pressed esc to get options such as "boot menu". There was a Grub Boot manager as option 1 and Windows boot manager as option 2. I remember when I set up a dual booting that I ended up with this situation. I could boot to windows either from Grub or from using that other boot manager. So now I picked up the 2nd option and it then tried to complete the step 2/2 in my resize partition and create an ext partition thing. It failed on that
[22:30:42] <kuhilas> 2/2. Then I booted again with that win boot manager and it ran some HP restore or fix thing. After that I could boot my windows with that win boot manager option. The windows C partition is shrunk as I want so the step 1/2 worked it seems. Now the problem is that I can only boot windows and it happens through pressing esc on boot and choosing boot menu and win boot manager from there

[23:28:35] <ttoocs> I'm just thinking such a "live-migration" utility would exist... my best idea is using a FuseFS, which on access of a file, finishes moving it, and then grants access to it. -> Laggy for the first open, but guaranteed consistant.
[23:28:46] <jcbjoe2021> akoana: that was another proposed idea for this problem

[23:30:48] <akoana> jcbjoe2021: with "&"  the .mp4 files would be xdg-opened in the background and if xdg-open starts an video player you'd view all .mp4 files almost simultaneously :)
