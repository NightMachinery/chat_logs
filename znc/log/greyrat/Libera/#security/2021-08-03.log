[02:05:16] <Dev0n> Hash, yea like a server that you can tunnel your ssh connection
[02:05:24] <Hash> Does the world need access to 22?
[02:05:30] <Dev0n> no, only a specific IP
[02:05:47] <Hash> If it's just one ip, disable 22 on everything, make a random high port for ssh, limit to 1 ip, key based, and give to the person you need

[02:06:49] <Dev0n> Hash, 22 was never going to be open to the world. My question was if there was a reason having another server in the middle between you and the main server to SSH

[02:10:41] <Dev0n> But this is a hard problem to solve. An application that requires access to a DB instance will inherently have credentials exposed in that server running the application.
[02:10:51] <Hash> Then setup a middle server, like your original idea, and give access to the ip, and only put the data required for that user, and jail them to some specific dir, maybe put in sudo to only allow specific binaries to run.

[02:13:31] <Hash> if no one needs access to th emain server or anything else connected to it, then setup a private data share between the middle server and main server, disable everything on main server apart from the data share, jailed, and allow only access to middle server, where they can't ssh out to anything, conenct to anything but just have the data they need to work with.

[03:31:21] <electr0n> you can write it all you want for learning purposes but never ever publish cause even if you say "DO NOT USE" or comment it EVERYWHERE, someone will use it in production, so just don't do it.

[03:40:58] <electr0n> That number increases to 6 to 7 hours of actual work when at home.

[04:58:11] <mats1> how often do you have to mount a damaged image in a vm and feed it to chkdsk or diskutil
[04:58:22] <flyback> i've had to before
[04:58:32] <flyback> I tell you the grace peroid of win10 is a lifesaver
[04:58:45] <flyback> at least 4 times now I took the customer's damaged too much to repair win10 install
[04:58:47] <flyback> converted it to a vm
[04:58:55] <flyback> then I could immediately wipe and reload their physical box

[04:59:02] <flyback> while using the vm to extract settings and files

[05:29:54] <flyback> The issue affects SSDs with an HPE firmware version prior to HPD8 that results in SSD failure at 32,768 hours of operation (i.e., 3 years, 270 days 8 hours).

[09:04:32] <flyback> MUHAHAHAAA
[09:04:38] <flyback> TLER HACK RULES AGAIN
[09:04:45] <flyback> I AM INVINCEABLE
[09:05:16] * flyback uses TLER to reduce the maximum amount of time a hd will spend on a bad sector, to speed up imaging all the rest
[09:05:31] <flyback> TLER Is usually used for drives in a raid array so they don't get licked out
[09:05:35] <flyback> but it works good for ddrescue also
[09:05:52] <flyback> if there's a ton of sectors to go thru and not all are bad but are in a "group"
[09:06:02] <flyback> you can tler timeout to like 0.5S instead of 30s
[09:06:06] <flyback> per sector
[09:06:09] <flyback> so it just gives up early
[09:06:26] <flyback> then once it's down to only a few sectors unread, turn the tler back up
[09:08:12] <flyback> 1405KB bad out of 500GB, not bad
