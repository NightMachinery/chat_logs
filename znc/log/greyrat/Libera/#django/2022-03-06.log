[01:47:28] <jcass> hi. trying to get a form that's based on a model to show its html in the shell... is that possible?
[01:48:47] <jcass> first it would be nice if I could import it
[01:48:53] <GinFuyou> form.as_p()
[01:49:06] <jcass> hi GinFuyou
[01:49:53] <GinFuyou> Heloo
[01:52:23] <jcass> so I import the form class in my app/forms.py, then use the class to make an instance?
[01:53:03] <GinFuyou> which class? forms.Form / forms.ModelForm ?
[01:54:02] <jcass> so I import the form class in my app/forms.py, then use the class to make an instance?
[01:54:07] <jcass> oops :)
[01:54:27] <jcass> the class I made in my app's forms.py
[01:54:45] <jcass> there's two, but right now I have TopicForm
[01:55:10] <jcass> it derives from forms.ModelForm
[01:55:11] <GinFuyou> Then just import it where you need it
[01:55:52] <GinFuyou> DjangoGirls tutorial has a better section on forms than official tutorial if you want to go over it
[01:57:00] <jcass> (jim here) yes, I think we were talking about it yesterday
[01:57:47] <GinFuyou> Well, still something unclear?
[01:59:03] <jcass> umm, haven't had time to go thru the djangogirls material yet, I think I might have gone through some of it, but then I went for the official tutorial (sects 1-7)
[01:59:29] <jcass> and I (jim) got that working
[01:59:47] <GinFuyou> official tutorial is a good start, for now I only have issues with forms section
[02:00:15] <GinFuyou> Well, good to hear. I'll go afk for about 20 mins then now
[02:00:36] <jcass> as I said then, I would like to see something on doing forms without models
[02:00:53] <jcass> ok, maybe see you in a bit (need salad)
[02:14:26] *** Quits: theprophet (~theprophe@212.58.102.155) (Quit: Client closed)
[02:18:24] <GinFuyou> jcass, what do you mean by forms without models exactly? forms.Form is not basing of the model as modelform, you make it manually adding fields just like you do with models, but it's forms.* fields instead
[02:18:29] <GinFuyou> if it's what you mean
[02:19:17] <jcass> well is it possible to make a form without an associated model?
[02:21:46] <GinFuyou> As I've just said - yes.
[02:22:13] <GinFuyou> ModelForm is just automation of creating a form, when it does have an associated model
[02:22:52] <jcass> (side question, where in the docs is 'path
[02:22:57] <jcass> explained?
[02:23:03] <jcass> )
[02:23:05] <GinFuyou> https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/forms/#building-a-form-in-django
[02:23:39] <GinFuyou> jcass, url `path` you mean? https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/http/urls/#path-converters
[02:24:54] <jcass> thanks, jcass is here, and he wanted to see that

[15:46:51] <yanchai> wez: htmx is ok to use?
[15:49:10] <wez> Never used it, or heard of it.
[15:49:50] <wez> Ah, another framework, yeah sure

[15:53:32] <wez> Probably
[15:54:20] <wez> What's the question?
[15:54:57] <yanchai> i would like to loop the questions to create a checklist
[15:55:17] <yanchai> 1 declaration has many checklist and each question is in the checklist
[15:57:43] <yanchai> its working in the admin but im confused on the frontend using htmx or react
[15:58:00] <yanchai> well not totally on the frontend
[15:58:14] <yanchai> i mean id the views
[15:59:05] <yanchai> what should happen is create one declaration object and multiple checklists objects related to the declaration model where the question field is a foreignkey
[15:59:14] <wez> yanchai: Yeah, create a view to do it.
[15:59:50] <wez> The view could be GraphQL or REST Framework (DRF) too, which the frontend calls.
[15:59:52] <yanchai> wez: do i need to loop to save every checklist answered?
[16:00:06] <wez> If that's what you want to do
[16:00:17] <yanchai> wez: ok thanks
