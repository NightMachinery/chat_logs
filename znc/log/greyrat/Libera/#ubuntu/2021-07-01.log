[00:06:01] <epi> hmm I see what looks like port 22 is open. I can ssh into my own system from myself, but if I try to ssh in from another system on the same network, I get a connection refused. I used ufw to allow ssh and then enabled ufw. What could I have missed?

[00:08:45] <tomreyn> goddard: it's most likely unrelated, but your logs are filling up with the "foliate" snap trying to access /proc/zoneinfo, but failing to due to being a snap / contrained by apparmor. this is likely a bug in the snap, you could try to report, if you can find out how.

[01:39:05] <webchat86> Im thinking of installing Lubuntu
[01:39:49] <Mekaneck> Lubuntu uses LXQt these days iirc not lxde
[01:39:56] <webchat86> right
[01:39:59] <webchat86> What do you think is better
[01:40:01] <leftyfb> webchat86: you are welcome to try ubuntu. It's free

[01:40:04] <webchat86> Yes
[01:40:11] <webchat86> I want lightweight so looking at Lubuntu
[01:40:47] <ezakimak> last comparison I read showed LXDE used about the same amount of ram as full on kde
[01:41:01] <Mekaneck> and how secure your system is depends on the end user
[01:41:10] <webchat86> holy sheeeeeeeee
[01:41:16] <webchat86> LXDE just as laggy as KDE?
[01:41:17] <webchat86> ?
[01:41:22] <ezakimak> or KDE got smaller
[01:41:36] <ezakimak> I think it was a phoronix or ars technica comparison
[01:41:45] <Mekaneck> ezakimak: KDE Plasma uses up between 950MB and 1GB of RAM

[11:19:01] <rfried> Hi. there's seems to be some kind of process that creates few network bridges and ip routes that launches automatically on boot. I couldn't find who it is.
[11:19:01] <rfried> Anyone has an idea on how can I tracker the process ? (Ubuntu server 20.04)
[11:24:56] <roltux> Rfried, you could use auditd to track prosses, files, users etc.

[14:06:08] <gpeskens[w]> yeah
[14:06:28] <gpeskens[w]> I "think" it might be because I upgraded to 21.04 and that has shifted to wayland by default
[14:07:14] <gpeskens[w]> At home I also upgraded, experienced loads of annoyances with wayland (copy buffers between X11 hosted applications and wayland applications not working being the biggest gripe) and switched back the same day.
[14:07:26] <gpeskens[w]> And there I don't have the same issue.

[23:27:24] <jushur> alsman3: you obviously need the firmware to load first.

[23:27:58] <jushur> yes and no, the dev is detected, but it does not work without the firmware
[23:28:47] <alsman3> I thought that hdsploader is firmware itself
