[00:03:37] <derjanni> Last apex dev I met was a very nice and beautiful girl, 6 months into programming. Wrote a bunch of very complex and ugly apex triggers for API calls to external systems involving bank credentials. Don't get me started.

[00:08:57] <derjanni> There is essentially no sandboxing or security. Your apex stuff has access to almost everything and can call absolutely everything.
[00:09:47] <derjanni> dev tools for apex leave a lot to be desired, yo many devs end up doing stuff in production which is ugly af
[00:10:27] *** Quits: redoc (~redoc@user/redoc) (Remote host closed the connection)
[00:10:34] <derjanni> again, not a lot of experienced devs are into apex things. so it's mostly entry-level self-taught people. Apex is not very satisfying.

[00:18:29] <derjanni> it's not a technical issue, it's a social one.
[00:18:47] <derjanni> why try to hack a CRM, when social engineering in takes less than 3 hours
[00:19:06] <pyzozord> yeah but that's not unique to salesforce
[00:19:21] <pyzozord> companies make employees do what companies find profitable
[00:19:29] <pyzozord> there is 0 interested in employee
[00:19:53] <pyzozord> well not true, there is just enough interest in employee to attract new talent and retain some talent
[00:20:15] <pyzozord> it's business, it's all for profit, companies don't care for you because they are nice
[00:20:23] <derjanni> depends on the company.

[02:16:08] <flakland> yeah if you move a file across a fileystem boundary the OS will probably unlink it from the original without a proper erase
[02:16:20] *** Joins: spacecraft (~spacecraf@98.50.16.116)

[04:43:56] <LjL> why download BeOS when you can download Haiku
[04:44:33] <pulse> I know it's gray area legally but I'll make the same argument I make with abandonware games. If the licensed copy is only available for $300, then I see no moral objection to using an abandonware site to get a copy.

[04:46:13] <pulse> And objective value of a 1992 DOS game is NOT $90. Ever.
[04:46:18] <pulse> And some go for far more.
[04:47:02] <Burkuf> pulse: My understanding is that all values are subjective...
[04:47:29] <PlanckWalk> The social contract with copyright is that the copyright holder gets a temporary monopoly to incentivize creation and distribution. If they've given up the incentive, they don't get to assert the monopoly anymore.

[04:48:26] <pulse> Not to mention it's hard to even get a floppy drive these days. :P

[04:55:18] <LjL> it's totally not climate change and pandemics, it's because of people misusing Mickey Mouse even though its copyright *should* already have expired but politicians have been lobbies to stop that.

[13:59:58] <Daemonick> Hi devs
[14:00:10] <fscklife> Someone says AdBlock/NoScript reduce security because they increase attack surface and I respond that add-ons are run sandboxed and the evil JS is a much larger attack surface
[14:00:21] <fscklife> They say it is only when you enable strict site isolation. Which I think is incorrect because AdBlocks work through injecting JS in individual pages.
[14:00:28] *** Joins: delvx (~arek@77.252.63.98)
[14:00:28] <fscklife> What is your opinion?

[14:02:38] <Daemonick> We humans are the clever agents
[14:02:54] <Daemonick> The machine is us/using us
[14:03:21] <InPhase> Ads have notoriously been a source of security problems.  Sites with trusted content sell space on their site into which untrusted content is placed, leading to additional opportunities for exploiting.
[14:03:49] <InPhase> This doesn't create the original security holes that are exploited, but it sure increases the number of attacks against them.

[15:59:01] <Snake`s_Ghost> isn't he working on being less annoying?
[15:59:20] <macaw> DnzAtWrk most people (who speak out) in the linux community seem to be ones that like to research how everything works.
[15:59:21] <bomb> yeah, after he's kinda forced to
[15:59:21] <Snake`s_Ghost> he came off break and started following the community code of conduct
[16:00:01] <macaw> If you don't have that drive, it may not be that easy to break in(to) linux.
[16:00:20] <DnzAtWrk> yes, but then the community should stop whining about the adoption rate of linux

[18:18:02] <leduyquang753> (Compared to JS.)
[18:18:03] <pyzozord> yeah but interpreting any instruction set will be slow as hell
[18:18:17] <pyzozord> and the js is jit'ed nowadays
[18:18:17] <Bou> for me the problem with WASM is that it's very isolated, can't modify DOM etc without a callback to Javascript
[18:18:45] <Bou> you get a chunk of memory and you can modify it, no graphics, networking, anything... otherwise it would have been a nice javascript killer

[18:21:45] <Bou> yep the jit'ed code is extremely fast because of it

[19:00:08] <pyzozord> I had a thought today, wondering why are we stuck with such poor keyboard layouts
[19:00:22] <pulse> Poor? What do you mean?
[19:00:27] <pulse> QWERTY is perfection.
[19:00:35] <pyzozord> obviously outside of natural language, mathematics is the next most immediatly necessary set of symbols
[19:00:36] <bud> pyzozord: are you scandinavian?
[19:00:47] <pyzozord> yet we don't even have symbol for multiplication
[19:00:50] <pulse> ANSI version though, not that silly ISO version.
[19:00:58] <bomb> pyzozord I switched to US layout and programming became easier
[19:00:59] <pyzozord> bud: no, slavic
[19:01:34] <pyzozord> I'm so used to it I don't even notice it, but * is not a multiplication symbols guys...

[19:03:23] <pyzozord> having more nice symbols available on everyone's keyboard would allow for much nicer language designs
[19:03:37] <pulse> No, it wouldn't.
[19:03:39] <bud> tilde is a dead key, you need to hold AltGr press ']' (US qwerty) and then space. backslash is typed with AltGr+Shift+= ... 
[19:03:41] <pulse> C and ASCII is all you need.
[19:03:59] <bud> tilde/backtick key is replaced by some strange paragraph symbol.
[19:04:08] <pyzozord> C has a reduced symbol set too
[19:04:18] <pyzozord> instead of {} it has <% and %> or something like that
[19:04:20] <Bou> if you would take all the keystrokes in the world for a week, how much of all that typing would be code and how much writing e-mails, chatting on irc, etc
[19:04:33] <bud> parenthesis and brackets are all moved to awkward positions. nordic QWERTY is the worst layout.

[20:26:09] <bud> i created a ~/.vimrc for the first time today. I wanted to have different cursors depending on the mode.
[20:26:39] <bud> it works, but it changes the cursor very slowly when i leave insert mode.

[20:28:29] <merijn> bud: You're using esc to exit insert mode?
[20:28:41] <merijn> Some terminals buffer esc, because it's part of escape sequences
[20:28:47] <bud> pyzozord: but it is instand when i go in to insertmode..
[20:28:56] <merijn> Sometimes up to a few 100 milliseconds, which is *super* noticable
[20:29:11] <bud> merijn: yeah, or you know, capslock (remapped with keyd)
[20:29:15] <merijn> bud: Because you don't use escape for entering insert mode ;)
[20:29:18] <pyzozord> depends on the key and probably even what possible bindings are for given key
[20:29:36] <merijn> caps lock remapped to escape is still escape to your terminal
[20:29:53] <pyzozord> i always use ctrl+c
[20:29:57] <bud> yep, especially with keyd, since it remaps on the kernel level.
[20:30:12] <pyzozord> (except I noticed when I don't have esc I do miss it, apparently I do use esc sometimes)
[20:30:24] <merijn> which means that any delay on escape is still your terminal's fault :p
[20:30:29] <bud> ha, ctrl+c was much faster.
[20:31:37] <bud> i just tested with xterm, it was exactly as slow as URxvt

[22:21:05] <user51> currently my plan is to make an equivalent to hoc, then an equivalent to awk, then do some improvements to awk
[22:21:13] <pulse> I'm biased towards videogames so my advice is videogames. ;)

[22:21:38] <user51> i've previously written an unfinished intel 8080 emulator, which is similar to the gameboy, so i could refactor it
[22:21:51] <pulse> Who wouldn't be impressed with a Pacman clone where you can put ghosts on fire and they slowly burn down the level?
[22:22:00] <pulse> user51, Perfect!
[22:22:17] <pulse> Add a self-made game and you're firmly in the top 1%. :)
[22:22:27] <user51> what kind of game?
[22:22:38] <pulse> Any kind that will run in the emulator. Tetris.
[22:22:49] <pulse> Preferably with some funky mechanic.

[22:22:58] <user51> i could simply use gameboy assembly, and write an assembler at the same time
[22:23:12] <pulse> Right.
[22:23:46] <jeaye> For me, it was primarily open sourece game engine work until I had the work experience to show.
