[04:39:58] <ButterNoodle> I went afk for a while
[04:40:08] <ButterNoodle> to locate the problem, and fix it
[04:40:27] <snake> how did you know?
[04:40:54] <ButterNoodle> I got the chat logs that HR had from someone
[04:41:20] <ButterNoodle> well I seen the screenshots
[04:41:38] <snake> i see
[04:41:59] <MootPoot> Wtf 
[04:42:00] <ButterNoodle> any idle'er in here could be a spy o.o
[04:42:02] <MootPoot> Is that for real 
[04:42:07] <MootPoot> How did they know it was you
[04:42:26] <snake> pretty ez, just walk in during work or down time at work and look at the taskbar
[04:42:31] <snake> "snake @libera.chat"
[04:42:41] <ButterNoodle> yea my taskbar didnt say that
[04:42:48] <snake> o ok, do you have labels off?
[04:42:52] <MootPoot> Network logs?
[04:42:59] <ButterNoodle> mitm ssl
[04:43:03] <snake> i have labels on
[04:43:07] <snake> because i like labels
[04:43:13] <MootPoot> Idk I don't connect my phone to work or outside wifi ever 
[04:43:20] <snake> icons without labels are a crime against humanity (most of the time)
[04:43:27] <MootPoot> Was it on your PC?
[04:43:46] <Aurora_v_kosmose> snake: Even if he fires you, if he said enough, he'll be fucked a lot more than you will.
[04:43:56] <ButterNoodle> *wont go into details
[04:43:59] <snake> Aurora_v_kosmose, he didn't say enough
[04:44:07] <snake> i was fired
[04:44:19] <snake> they finally gave up on making me quit
[04:44:25] <snake> but they asked me to resign lol
[04:44:30] <Aurora_v_kosmose> snake: Oh. And there I was about to recommend "you might want to line something else up before doing so though"
[04:44:37] <MootPoot> Ugh
[04:44:40] <ButterNoodle> yea you need evidence.. 
[04:44:40] <MootPoot> Lesson learned
[04:44:45] <ButterNoodle> in merica
[04:44:46] <snake> "uh.. yeah i could do that... lemme just hmm, i dont want to quit though"
[04:44:48] <MootPoot> Never trusting work wifi
[04:44:56] <ButterNoodle> prosecutors dont like to waste time of stuff that is hard
[04:45:07] <snake> evidence is necessary
[04:45:10] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Making you resign sounds like bullshit.
[04:45:14] <snake> i don't think that is a bad thing
[04:45:19] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Meant for tax reasons or something
[04:45:26] <snake> Aurora_v_kosmose, to screw me out of UC
[04:45:31] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: never do anything on a work resource that you wouldnt want someone is security explaining to hr that you need to be fired over
[04:45:32] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I'd ask if I can record them so I can share the reasons of my employment claim to government
[04:45:35] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Ohterwise I'm not resigning.
[04:45:55] <Aurora_v_kosmose> (If you're going to be fired anwyay, why not bait them?)
[04:45:57] <snake> i asked him to put it in writing
[04:46:05] <snake> and then i was going to refuse to sign it (trololol)
[04:46:07] <Aurora_v_kosmose> snake: Close-enough, that works too
[04:46:16] <snake> but then he said "it will be worded as a termination letter"
[04:46:24] <snake> im like ok yeah, let me know when you sent it
[04:46:27] <MootPoot> Ugh
[04:46:46] <MootPoot> My work dosent make me install anything aside from ms teams

[04:47:52] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And yeah, there's the whole "ewww, proprietary junkware"
[04:48:00] <snake> (but i do suspect zoom and business branded zooms)
[04:49:05] <snake> (and things like sococo are pretty sus too)
[04:50:28] <MootPoot> I should seperate my work and my personal PC
[04:50:36] <MootPoot> Don't have enough money atm
[04:51:12] <snake> my work was pretty cool about buying us equipment
[04:51:20] <snake> but we were all underpaid anyways so that's probably why lol
[04:51:25] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: Normally your employer is supposed to provide the machine or budget to expense one so you can separate liability concerns.
[04:54:04] <ButterNoodle> I'll be packing my personal laptop and use my own hotspot for internet

[05:14:58] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And I have no intent whatsoever to hand over my hardware, nevermind decrypt anything.
[05:15:08] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That would complicate things for everyone.

[05:46:52] <snake> MootPoot, trusted platform module?
[05:46:56] <hassoon> dooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooods
[05:47:03] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: yea I got screwed on a few 7 licenses
[05:47:08] <Aurora_v_kosmose> hassoon: sup
[05:47:13] <snake> oh well i already have one so i guess im good
[05:47:29] <snake> my server does not have TPM which is a heckin' shame cause it'd be perfect
[05:47:30] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I don't think TPM is mandatory though. A lot of gaming mobos don't have one.
[05:47:41] <hassoon> Aurora_v_kosmose: installing my softwares suite in my newly installed debian OS in my newly bought laptop
[05:47:47] <MootPoot> well, ANY tpm is mandatory
[05:47:48] <snake> or if it has it i can't use it because luks doesn't know how to O~o
[05:47:52] <Aurora_v_kosmose> hassoon: That's good.
[05:47:57] <MootPoot> it dosen't need to have a hardware one
[05:47:57] <ButterNoodle> I always get a tpm module with my system.. whether its integrated or I have to buy it separate
[05:48:03] <hassoon> Aurora_v_kosmose: :D
[05:48:19] <MootPoot> most recent cpus have firmware TPMS on them
[05:48:30] <ButterNoodle> rly?
[05:48:32] <Aurora_v_kosmose> TPM is useless if you don't actually set it up, which the overwhelming majority of people don't.
[05:48:41] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Microsoft's signature means nothing to me.
[05:49:04] <ButterNoodle> its a convenience for windows.. I can live wo it on linux

[05:50:06] <ButterNoodle> and someone will find a way to hack the keys out of TPM one day
[05:50:45] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: TPM does it mean we can't install Linux?
[05:51:43] <Aurora_v_kosmose> amigojapan: iirc when using the Microsoft signature you have to use a signature shim.
[05:52:00] <Aurora_v_kosmose> amigojapan: https://github.com/rhboot/shim

[05:52:02] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: tpm is just a storage module for certs
[05:52:04] <MootPoot> shim?
[05:52:17] <ButterNoodle> as of today, its a pita to use on linux
[05:52:18] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle:  well, yes, but also it can generate keys and stuff
[05:52:21] <amigojapan> Ah ok ButterNoodle 
[05:52:30] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Erh right, SecureBoot uses TPM, but TPM presence doesn't mean enabled secure boot
[05:52:33] <MootPoot> and serve as a RNG generator
[05:52:35] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: thats all I use it for.. bitlocker
[05:52:42] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: Do not trust hardware RNGs.
[05:53:04] <Aurora_v_kosmose> At least, not ones built-in to computers.
[05:53:11] <MootPoot> I did a research paper back on TPMs for uni... I was surprised to figure out they could do so much more then just a key store
[05:53:25] <MootPoot> create PGP keys, signing, RNG, etc
[05:53:34] <snake> RNG generator - Stands for "Random number generator generator."
[05:53:38] <ButterNoodle> yea, but linux
[05:53:40] <Aurora_v_kosmose> So many unverified and unverifiable crypto operations.
[05:53:47] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Wonderful hardware blackbox.
[05:53:53] <MootPoot> idk about linux but I dug up a microsfot demo which was a .NET library for stuff
[05:54:12] <MootPoot> wym unverified?
[05:54:24] <ButterNoodle> windows is probably backdored by the gubberment anyway
[05:54:26] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: You cannot verify the sourcecode of the RNG or any of the crypto.
[05:54:38] <MootPoot> its not even a black box really, theres specs for the TPM standard
[05:54:41] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: And crypto is notoriously hard to implement without mistake in a single try.
[05:54:45] <MootPoot> Aurora_v_kosmose:  yeah, its on ROM chips
[05:54:51] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Nevermind with malicious intent.
[05:54:54] <MootPoot> made buy a few different manufacturers
[05:54:55] <snake> yeah but at least we can rest assured the gubberment doesn't actually care about us collecting hentai
[05:55:15] <snake> it's more that the obscenity law is there so nobody can say it isn't there, maybe?
[05:55:16] <Aurora_v_kosmose> snake: Can you? Moroco cares a lot.
[05:55:19] <MootPoot> I found a way to get the TPM to encrypt and decrypt bytes for me
[05:55:21] <MootPoot> which was cool
[05:55:22] <ButterNoodle> *feds seize laptop with bitlocker and starts licking their lips
[05:55:31] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle:  STOP

[05:55:57] <snake> Aurora_v_kosmose, if a govt is backdooring windows, it's gonna be us govt not moroco
[05:55:58] <MootPoot> :{
[05:56:12] <Aurora_v_kosmose> snake: I meant more the "doesn't care" part.
[05:56:25] <Aurora_v_kosmose> snake: Some countries might not care, but it depends a lot.
[05:56:38] <snake> Aurora_v_kosmose, i was responding to butternoodle's comment about the gubbermint's backdoor in windows 10
[05:56:41] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Japan would care a lot more about any copyrighted content I might have than any porn I might have.
[05:56:47] <ButterNoodle> there is no obscenity law... is a test to find if a particular piece is protected art or obscene and unprotected
[05:57:03] <Aurora_v_kosmose> (Japan didn't just drink the copyright cool-aid, they jumped into the barrel)
[05:57:54] <snake> ButterNoodle, i did want to get your perspective again, but i don't want to make all the images and personal drawings i made which i deleted to be for naught

[06:07:34] <snake> MootPoot, pixiv has bookmarks
[06:07:41] <snake> lol nah ahk sucks for things like that
[06:07:50] <snake> i'll have to write a greasemonkey script
[06:08:15] <snake> this windows install is RIP so i'll have to figure out what i need to do to nuke it
[06:08:25] <snake> but i dont understand how TPM and password works with bitlocker
[06:08:57] <snake> on luks, even if i used the same password it'd be a new key
[06:09:04] <MootPoot> in monkey terms = tpm encrypts with password. Password gets saved in TPM. You can have an seconday password for recovery
[06:09:15] <MootPoot> normally windows uses the TPM password
[06:09:45] <snake> MootPoot, does TPM create a new password for every new windows 10 install or what?
[06:10:02] <MootPoot> its generated for every unique drive
[06:10:25] <snake> damn it so the physical drive is RIP even though i've encrypted all my data >.>
[06:10:39] <MootPoot> well, you can just format and overwrite it
[06:10:45] <MootPoot> if you wanna still use the drive
[06:10:59] <snake> but if its the same password then its still the same encryption/decryption keys?
[06:11:09] <snake> maybe you dont know that much yet?
[06:11:16] <snake> on this specific matter
[06:11:18] <snake> i mean
[06:11:23] <snake> :v
[06:11:26] <snake> that came out wrong
[06:11:32] <snake> but i just meant it in a neutral way

[06:11:53] <MootPoot> jk
[06:11:56] <snake> lool
[06:12:01] <MootPoot> its a new password for every single drive
[06:12:12] <MootPoot> Bitlocker has nothing to do with your windows login password
[06:12:45] <snake> MootPoot, i wonder if reinstalling windows fresh would make that old data irrevocable though
[06:12:48] <snake> err
[06:12:51] <MootPoot> it would
[06:12:52] <snake> unrecoverable
[06:12:58] <snake> are you sure? how do you know?
[06:13:10] <MootPoot> since a fresh windows install will overwrite the drive after formatting it
[06:13:24] <snake> good enough
[06:13:30] <snake> it's not like anything is really gonna happen >.>
[06:13:54] <MootPoot> but yeah if you wanna bitlocker stuff, and you give a shit about your data
[06:13:58] <MootPoot> you gotta run backups
[06:14:03] <snake> yeah i do
[06:15:00] <MootPoot> that, and also at least in my experience bitlocker is a hit and miss with external HDDs
[06:15:20] <snake> do you mean hit or miss?
[06:15:21] <snake> :p
[06:15:37] <MootPoot> uh
[06:15:38] <MootPoot> yes
[06:15:56] <snake> it worked for my externals so far
[06:16:32] <MootPoot> for me, its worked for the externals I've bought myself
[06:16:39] <MootPoot> the premade enclosures
[06:16:50] <MootPoot> but its been fucky with docked hard drives 
[06:16:59] <snake> ohhh
[06:17:16] <MootPoot> also, it cuts down on your drive performance
[06:17:30] <MootPoot> at least in my case I lose like ~10% of hdd performance
[06:17:38] <MootPoot> ssd not really
[06:17:39] <snake> i haven't noticed that, but im used to 5400 rpm hard drives being the baseline "bad"

[06:36:35] <S_T_A_N> > Canning (Mason) jars will be airtight once the lid is screwed on only if the jar, lid, and ring are not compromised. However, there will still be air inside the jar. The only way to remove air from the jar is by following the safe canning practices recommended by the USDA, which forms a vacuum.

However, she sadly only had two hands, so she could only marry two princes. She decided to hold a tournament to determin​e what two princes would marry her. The day of the tournament arrived, but s​entionics accidentally won first and second place. Since marriage

[09:02:07] <davic>  Never was a fan of beer
[09:02:42] <sentionics> davic: I deal poorly with sugar (though I guess ethanol is a form of sugar - wait, I deal poorly with ethanol apparently too, but in a different way)
[09:02:51] <sentionics> so I tend to avoid it.
[09:03:08] <davic> sentionics: what you are telling me is that your body needs an upgrade
[09:03:13] <sentionics> I only drink water, milk, and alcohol. I stick to savory foods mostly.
[09:03:30] <sentionics> davic: yes. I'm ready to go full cyborg.
[09:04:04] <sentionics> Just keep the brain intact (and the booze processing unit needs to be up-to-par), and we're good.
[09:06:02] <sentionics> I mean, I can drink other stuff sometimes, and if I'm sober for a bit, I can handle some soda or a slice of cake, but too much, and my anxiety gets a bit much.
[09:07:07] <sentionics> That said, I'm largely unaffected by such things if I'm drunk. Hence tolerating Fireball whiskey, which is high on sugar.

[11:58:21] <ewong> ahh
[11:58:31] <ewong> Sadale: not slacking off..   taking a break :)

[11:59:02] <Sadale> ewong, still working in wherever you were working in? I couldn't remember where it is. I just remember that it's a non-IT company, and you work as an IT guy.
[11:59:50] <Sadale> On my side I'm still an embedded programmer. Switch job twice tho. And got raise for each switch. $_$

[12:00:09] <Sadale> So now it's my third job.
[12:00:12] <JesseDesu> sadale you money hungry
[12:00:22] <Sadale> JesseDesu, yes I am. How else I could retire at 40?

[12:00:28] <JesseDesu> i dunno
[12:00:32] <dfch> ￥￥￥
[12:00:35] <JesseDesu> i thought people retire at 65
[12:00:35] <Sadale> Only if my parents were filthy rich, which they aren't :-(
[12:00:48] <Sadale> Normal people do retire at 65. But I want to retire earlier.
[12:01:25] <dfch> Sadale, should've join HKPF for early retirement ;)
[12:01:28] <Sadale> And I'm lucky enough not to have went gung-ho and get a gf and marriage and kids. Otherwise retiring at 40 would be close to impossible.
[12:01:36] <HubertFarnsworth> 65 is too long to be working.
[12:01:46] <JesseDesu> my dad is 63
[12:01:49] <JesseDesu> still werkin
[12:01:53] <Sadale> dfch, lolwut? I don't recall it being that profitable to join the team. Plus I think they have to work at saturdays :(
[12:02:13] <JesseDesu> on saturdays
[12:02:15] <dfch> oh wait... since '15 it's 57 :O
[12:02:29] <dfch> since 2015 retirement age is 57yo oh my
[12:02:30] <HubertFarnsworth> Government and bank employees retire at 63-65 here. Business people earlier.
[12:02:38] <Sadale> JesseDesu, yeah. That's why I have to plan early so that hopefully I'd have enough money by 40.
[12:02:55] <JesseDesu> !findquote retirement
[12:02:55] <ImoutoBot> JesseDesu: (58 / 146) <J​igsy> Most people work their entire life, then retire. I, being contrarian, decided to start with retirement first.

[12:03:33] <Sadale> Then my savings would probably last until I'm 60-70. Then it'd be exhausted. Not that it'd matter anymore because I'd be old af.
[12:03:40] <HubertFarnsworth> But working till 65 years old sucks!
[12:03:42] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: sorry. I am at the hospital after one lesson

[12:06:34] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, are you talking about people like davic? :P
[12:06:39] <dfch> or at least I got one

[12:10:16] <DunceCotus> inject hydroxychloriquinone if you have to
[12:10:23] <dfch> amigojapan it's k, also *zeneca
[12:10:34] <HubertFarnsworth> What’s all this talk about marriage in ##anime? It’s like Trump talking about Science.

[12:11:50] <DunceCotus> AstraZeneca is safe iirc
[12:11:51] <HubertFarnsworth> Not 3D, 2d
[12:11:56] <DunceCotus> just very rare can cause blood clotting
[12:12:22] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, I don't have one yet.
[12:12:25] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, konata maybe?
[12:12:26] <Sadale> dfch, ^
[12:12:33] <dfch> amigojapan, am not joking though, not about the name (proper: astrozeneca), nor about it's being k. Frankly you should get whatever they have in your area. If you get to choose, then sure, go for Pfizer, the only thing to avoid is one-shot ones, unless emergency.
[12:12:38] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: and heat stopping too apparently
[12:12:58] <DunceCotus> amigojapan heat stopping?

[12:22:33] <Sadale> There used to be a Park n Shop nearby. Now that it's gone. I couldn't remebmer what it's turned into.

[12:23:41] <Sadale> dfch, it's on Nathan Road close to Mcdonalds. I'm not sure on which side is "right" side of mcd.
[12:23:55] <dfch> if you face the stairs

[12:34:26] <gnoo> damn, that's light

[13:13:41] <Sadale> Didn't know that
[13:14:00] <amigojapan> Yeah
[13:14:07] <Sadale> Here in Cantonese we've only got the verb for this word.
[13:14:21] <amigojapan> Ah
[13:15:02] <amigojapan> Sadale: can you understand 予約?
[13:15:23] <amigojapan> It can be used as a noun in Japanese too
[13:16:42] <Sadale> amigojapan, yep. It's written as 預約 here, or informally, we say "book" in English.
[13:17:04] <amigojapan> I see
[13:17:20] <Sadale> oh. 預約 is a noun here. 約 is the verb.

[13:17:42] <amigojapan> Ah ok

[14:22:32] <Sadale> hmm. I see. So the average RAM of computers doubles approximately every 5 years.
[14:24:57] <ia_> O.O thats random
[14:29:16] <Sadale> And the CPU performance seems to be doubling every 4 years.
[14:29:30] <Sadale> I'm try to estimate when I should upgrade my computer.
[14:31:04] <Sadale> Oh. As for the CPU, not really. Most of the increase came from the new cores. For the single-thread performance, it doubles very slowly.

[15:52:54] <Sadale> amigojapan, I know.
[15:54:32] <amigojapan> Sadale: at least with existing technology we should start to see PC technology stagnating
[15:54:53] <Sadale> amigojapan, yep. I know. Anyway the single core performance is still slowly improving. Very slowly tho.
[15:55:00] <Sadale> Not as fast as multicoree performance.
[15:56:02] <amigojapan> Right
[15:56:26] <Sadale> So if it's a computer upgrade I think I should be more worried about RAM than the CPU.
[15:56:44] <Sadale> It doubles every 5 years. 5 years. That's short.
[15:56:59] <Sadale> My imouto's computer only has 8GB of RAM. She may need more in the near future. :(
[15:57:53] <emmeka> at least RAM is an easy and cheap upgrade
[16:01:53] <amigojapan> emmeka: it did not get expensive with Corona
[16:02:20] <amigojapan> ?
[16:02:37] <emmeka> idk I added another RAM to my wife's laptop last fall and it wasn't exceptionally expensive
[16:02:59] <amigojapan> Alright
[16:03:56] <amigojapan> I think my PC is maxed out at 16gb
[16:04:20] <emmeka> 16gb is fine for everything right now, really
[16:05:25] <emmeka> this laptop had 8gb, 1 free slot. So I just bought a second one of the exact same 8gb chip it had in it and bumped it up to 16gb
[16:05:58] <Sadale> 16GB is actually pretty decent as of today.
[16:06:22] <Sadale> In 5 years tho, it'll become meh. And in 5 more years after that, it'd probably become inadaquate.

[16:11:46] <amigojapan> Nyanpasu- o/ HubertFarnsworth 
[16:12:00] <emmeka> HubertFarnsworth I assume it is with the original Lupin though, like the French character and not the anime one
[16:12:19] <HubertFarnsworth> The vending machine from yesterday wasn’t from India amigojapan. Found it on Reddit.
[16:12:41] <amigojapan> Sadale: your predictions mostly are for videogames
[16:13:01] <Sadale> amigojapan, browsers too
[16:13:06] <HubertFarnsworth> Oh, I forgot that Lupin emmeka. What is he like?
[16:13:18] <amigojapan> Sadale: 4gb is still fine for Linux ah ok HubertFarnsworth 
[16:13:28] <Sadale> amigojapan, no. It isn't if you're using 64bit system.
[16:13:45] <emmeka> HubertFarnsworth also note the spelling on that title.
[16:13:50] <emmeka> "Herlock Sholmes".
[16:13:51] <amigojapan> True Sadale 
[16:13:54] <Sadale> amigojapan, Actually it's fine as long as you aren't launching productivity programs with firefox simultaneously. Like Inkscape + firefox.
[16:14:08] <emmeka> the book was written by the author of the Lupin books, and couldn't use Sherlock's name directly for copyright
[16:14:14] <Sadale> I used both of them back when I was using my 4GB laptop. It simply isn't enough. :(
[16:14:24] <Sadale> Even with 32bit system that's still not quite enough
[16:14:28] <HubertFarnsworth> Ohh lol, I didn’t notice that at all emmeka
[16:15:18] <amigojapan> Sadale: I think SSD is much more important speed boost
[16:15:34] <emmeka> HubertFarnsworth the original Arsène Lupin (who's supposed to be the anime character's grandfather) is a thief and a gentleman who steals from villains and eludes capture by wit and intellect. He's basically the anti-Sherlock Holmes, a character who does the same things as Holmes, but to commit crimes.
[16:15:37] <Sadale> amigojapan, oh RAM and SSD are different. If you run out of RAM you're done.
[16:15:45] <Sadale> SSD is important in other way.
[16:15:58] <HubertFarnsworth> What do you do with all that ram Sadale? You don’t have like 10 browser tabs open and some app running on background?
[16:16:27] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, Point being, 4GB is just not quite enough these days.
[16:16:29] <HubertFarnsworth> Sounds good emmeka, I like it.
[16:16:41] <emmeka> 8gb of RAM is pretty sparse on a 64bit system these days
[16:16:52] <emmeka> thing will work, but you'll push it to the limit easily
[16:17:12] <HubertFarnsworth> You know the sad part Sadale, I don’t even remember how much ram I have.
[16:17:18] <Sadale> I can feel that. My imouto's hitting 8GB while playing games. But it still works, albeit with reduced performance
[16:17:23] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, wat?
[16:17:35] <HubertFarnsworth> Yeah, I forgot.
[16:17:39] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: run hardinfo
[16:18:04] <emmeka> Sadale yeah. Same problem for my wife. Hers was constantly topping out when gaming or using multiple tabs, threw in another 8gb, and it was fine.
[16:18:32] <HubertFarnsworth> It’s not about how to find out amigojapan. The point is, I actually forgot that. I used to care about this in past.
[16:18:37] <Sadale> emmeka, lucky you. I tried to do the same to my imouto's machine. turns out that one of the RAM slots of the mobo's defective :(
[16:18:47] <emmeka> lame
[16:18:55] <amigojapan> I see HubertFarnsworth 
[16:18:57] <emmeka> gotta buy a 16gb chip, that's less cheap
[16:19:04] <HubertFarnsworth> What games are they playing emmeka, Sadale?
[16:19:39] <emmeka> lots of things. my wife plays more games than I do now. I find it kind of funny because when we first met, she didn't play videogames at all... then I did this to her.
[16:19:56] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, minecraft
[16:20:03] <HubertFarnsworth> emmeka: you monster :p
[16:20:17] <HubertFarnsworth> Ouch Sadale, rip :p
[16:20:48] <emmeka> I remember not long after we started going out, she seen me playing minecraft, and seemed curious about it. So I said, ok, let me install it for you and you can try it out. She said idk, I don't really like videogames. I insisted, and she begrudgingly sat down to play it
[16:20:56] <emmeka> and then played Minecraft for 12 straight hours
[16:21:01] <amigojapan> By the way, after 4 months of keto, tomako reduced hat Hobgoblin a1c from 11.6 to 5.0 and the doctor said today that she does not need to inject insulin anymore
[16:21:36] <HubertFarnsworth> Minecraft is pretty neat game. I love it.
[16:22:12] <emmeka> I'm realizing that nowadays minecraft is old and I'm like an oldtimer of the game, which is weird.
[16:22:17] <HubertFarnsworth> Does she play mmorpg games too emmeka?
[16:22:19] <emmeka> I actually got Minecraft during its beta
[16:22:35] <HubertFarnsworth> Woah, that’s quite long.
[16:23:06] <HubertFarnsworth> When was that? 2010?
[16:23:49] <amigojapan> For me 2010 is not that long ago
[16:24:03] <HubertFarnsworth> Try red dead redemption emmeka, Sadale. It’s good!
[16:24:22] <emmeka> HubertFarnsworth 2011, I think?
[16:24:32] <emmeka> I've played the original Red Dead Redemption
[16:24:33] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, I don't need another game for now. thanks anyway :3
[16:26:17] <HubertFarnsworth> Sadale: what are you playing?
[16:26:18] <HubertFarnsworth> amigojapan: it does feel like that, I changed a lot from the past me of 2010.
[16:26:23] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, dumb flash games
[16:26:42] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, my imouto does play other games. The only game that the 8GB system's struggling with is minecraft.
[16:26:45] <HubertFarnsworth> Tell me
[16:27:01] <HubertFarnsworth> What kind of flash games?
[16:27:08] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: that's only 12 years ago. Only about a fourth of my life
[16:27:35] <HubertFarnsworth> Yeah amigojapan
[16:28:40] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: for me anything after 2001 is recent
[16:29:31] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: 9/11 was a big event. Maybe Corona will be a second big event
[16:29:41] <emmeka> HubertFarnsworth early Minecraft had a lot of weird things that I totally still can't get out of my head. I'm still sad that they took away the Far Lands
[16:30:45] <emmeka> it used to be that instead of a world boundary at the edge of the world, there was just a certain point where world generation stopped working due to a bug, this produced a very weird repeating terrain in cliff form encasing the world. Players called it the Far Lands.
[16:32:21] <HubertFarnsworth> I see emmeka. I didn’t know that.
[16:32:50] <amigojapan> Interesting emmeka 
[16:33:08] <HubertFarnsworth> amigojapan: I think covid will be big event in all our lives regardless of age.

[16:37:06] <emmeka> meh.
[16:37:23] <amigojapan> emmeka: a decade is not as much when you are four decades old
[16:37:30] <emmeka> in the Bush era people thought it was completely unforgettable and unsurpassable too
[16:37:44] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: I am already forgetting trump
[16:38:09] <DunceCotus> amigojapan that's more due to acceleration of time
[16:38:11] <Sxem> a jupiter year takes 12 earth years
[16:38:19] <emmeka> amigojapan it's still pretty long, a quarter of your life.
[16:38:30] <emmeka> and maybe half your working life
[16:38:44] <HubertFarnsworth> True emmeka. People thought there wouldn’t be another worse president like him back then.
[16:38:56] <HubertFarnsworth> That’s fast amigojapan
[16:39:00] <amigojapan> emmeka: it still feels short tho. And not long ago
[16:39:21] <DunceCotus> once again that's because of the acceleration of time
[16:39:24] <emmeka> it does to me too but more in a "fuck where did the time go" kind of way
[16:39:55] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: trump was a mess but it happened meantime covid and covid is a greater event
[16:40:27] <emmeka> rather than in a "10 years is actually a short amount of time, when you think about it" kind of way, because it isn't.
[16:40:30] <Sxem> time probably slowed down for a lot of humans during lockdown
[16:40:36] <DunceCotus> amigojapan what was japan's perception of Trump?
[16:40:37] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: people experience time going faster when they are old
[16:40:53] <DunceCotus> amigojapan yes but that's unrelated
[16:41:10] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: many people gave me condolences cause they knew I was Mexican
[16:41:19] <emmeka> lol
[16:41:21] <DunceCotus> haha
[16:41:26] <emmeka> that's actually hilarious
[16:41:51] <emmeka> random Japanese were like "oh? Mexican? you poor thing you can't get over Trump's wall, I'm so sorry"
[16:42:20] <DunceCotus> Trump's wall.. did he ever finish that?
[16:42:29] <emmeka> I mean it predated him.
[16:42:47] <DunceCotus> he built a wall before his term?
[16:43:15] <DunceCotus> I know there was a kind of barrier or fence
[16:43:22] <amigojapan> emmeka: kind of like that. Some people asked me what trump has agsist Mexico
[16:43:29] <Sxem> trump said 'When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're not sending you. They're not sending you. They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.'
[16:43:42] <DunceCotus> rofl
[16:44:13] <DunceCotus> surely Trump inc would be all over the immigrant labor
[16:44:27] <amigojapan> emmeka: also remember that trump was not actually dubbed into Japanese in things like "grab her by the pussy"no one knows about that here
[16:44:41] <DunceCotus> Trump clearly had to play to the xenophobic conservative crowd

[16:52:57] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: so you think time is actually getting faster like literally
[16:53:02] <DunceCotus> it has to do with our ability to process the novelty
[16:53:10] <DunceCotus> kids can process it a lot easier
[16:53:26] <DunceCotus> amigojapan yeah
[16:54:16] <DunceCotus> amigojapan which may indicate we are approaching a zero point

[16:55:50] <amigojapan> I know you already said that DunceCotus , the other day
[16:56:01] <DunceCotus> something that should take millions of years
[16:56:08] <DunceCotus> happened in the space of 10? 20?
[16:56:20] <DunceCotus> it likely wasn't gradual either
[16:56:39] <DunceCotus> amigojapan yeah I talk about it every other day
[16:56:52] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I already told you that those images of space are not actually the way space is
[16:57:04] <Sumida> it says 炭水化物2.7g
[16:57:29] <DunceCotus> amigojapan I am comparing it with memories of images of space tho
[16:57:39] <amigojapan> Sumida: yeah and it is ok if I have under 50g of carbs per day
[16:58:12] <Sumida> so 100g cream cheese will not add much
[16:58:37] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: you can't compare an old protection of space with a modern one
[16:58:42] <DunceCotus> I'm watching Bokurano
[16:58:49] <amigojapan> Right Sumida 
[16:58:58] <DunceCotus> amigojapan the old ones are changed too though
[16:59:07] <DunceCotus> if you can even find em..
[17:00:06] <DunceCotus> amigojapan what im talking about is not something our current sciences can explain
[17:00:32] <DunceCotus> it is about the structure of the unconscious
[17:01:40] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: imagine you took one of those old world maps where it said "and there be dragons there"or supported by elephants and turtles and compared it to a modern map. That is kind of what you are trying to do
[17:02:11] <DunceCotus> amigojapan not at all a good analogy
[17:02:25] <DunceCotus> I was comparing with memories of contemporaneous maps
[17:02:31] <DunceCotus> not of maps from middle ages
[17:03:19] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: but space maps from the 90s are outdated now
[17:05:21] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: maybe more than the middle age maps of the word were
[17:05:28] <DunceCotus> amigojapan world maps from the 90s would still be broadly the same as today tho
[17:05:56] <DunceCotus> amigojapan I'd say the space maps of the 90s were still accurate enough in terms of our rough location in the galaxy
[17:06:07] <amigojapan> We are taking about images from space tho. Those won't be the same
[17:06:13] * Sumida still existed in the 90s
[17:06:19] <DunceCotus> amigojapan to prove what you are saying we would have to see these 90s maps that are inaccurate
[17:06:40] <DunceCotus> good luck finding them
[17:06:47] <amigojapan> Yup Sumida 
[17:06:48] <DunceCotus> Sumida yeah me too
[17:07:02] <Sumida> before meiji era it was a bit more questionable
[17:08:12] <Sumida> however, near the end I was officially there
[17:08:45] <HubertFarnsworth> We had more Trump impact here amigojapan
[17:09:15] <HubertFarnsworth> Covid too
[17:09:35] <HubertFarnsworth> Neither couldn’t be forgotten for me
[17:10:23] <Sumida> Trump impact? sounds like a asteroid hitting the planet
[17:10:50] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: like what? Hold on brb
[17:11:07] <emmeka> DunceCotus there's been a few changes to the world map since the 90s, though. Partition of Sudan, independence of Kosovo, creation of Nunavut, renaming of Macedonia, Russian annexation of Crimea.
[17:11:53] <Sumida> that is only moving imaginary borders, not actual land
[17:13:03] <HubertFarnsworth> Yeah, the impact of just Trump becoming president of America and his immigration policy amigojapan. My business mainly relies on IT people in America. Some fund me and some buy from the states for their parents. Besides that there were many visa issues. Many people who can here for vacation couldn’t go back again.
[17:13:36] *** Quits: coeus (~coeus@237.sub-174-205-175.myvzw.com) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[17:13:37] <HubertFarnsworth> One of my friend says even the job scene has changed somewhat in America back then.
[17:14:06] <HubertFarnsworth> Companies would think twice to sponsor visa for foreign nationals.
[17:15:23] <HubertFarnsworth> Yeah, the world is all coming together. I heard Australia is moving fast compared to all.
[17:15:36] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: I see. But that is a latent problem with Americans. Tromp just justified it in the public eye
[17:15:39] <DunceCotus> Sumida right, what I am talking about emmeka is world map with different placement and shapes of continents
[17:15:49] <HubertFarnsworth> Something like ~7cm
[17:15:51] <DunceCotus> a world map with Arctica or without svalbard etc.
[17:16:12] <HubertFarnsworth> Only Antarctic is not moving, lazy ass
[17:16:13] <DunceCotus> not really talking about borders
[17:16:32] <DunceCotus> but they are moving too slow to explain what I've experienced
[17:16:55] <DunceCotus> but what i've experienced could be chalked up to delusion or memory error, but that seems like a cop-out
[17:17:12] <DunceCotus> Arctica existed
[17:17:21] <Sumida> north pole is only ice, I think?
[17:17:23] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: you probably just saw a different protection of earth
[17:17:32] <DunceCotus> no its not a projection thing
[17:17:44] <DunceCotus> Sumida yes, now
[17:18:22] <amigojapan> Sumida: I want to eat the North pole!
[17:18:25] <HubertFarnsworth> amigojapan: yeah, my point is , it would be something that stuck in my mind that someone could be so awesome. It’s like watching a bad anime you couldn’t forget.
[17:18:26] <Sumida> so if a volcano started growing at the north pole, it would be land again :)
[17:19:21] <HubertFarnsworth> At North Pole there is statue of Lenin I think.
[17:19:22] <amigojapan> I see HubertFarnsworth , but don't you agree it kind of merges with the covid problem in ways?
[17:19:38] <Sumida> that sounds like a fun project amigojapan
[17:20:28] <amigojapan> Sumida: since Japanese often call ice-cream "ice"
[17:20:34] <HubertFarnsworth> amigojapan: kind of, There was more pre covid Trump but he fucked up Covid too. I had little hope he would turn tables around by correctly handling covid.
[17:21:13] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: he actually got covid himself by not being careful
[17:21:34] <HubertFarnsworth> What’s that thing called where they sprinkle some juice on ice?
[17:21:56] <Sumida> kakigoori without the cream
[17:21:59] <DunceCotus> juiced ice?
[17:22:04] <HubertFarnsworth> Yeah amigojapan, he is totally out of his mind.
[17:23:09] <HubertFarnsworth> There is also ice mixed with different types of juices in long transparent cover which you suck from cover. Don’t know what they are called in English.
[17:23:20] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: yeah. That is why the trump problem and covid are like one thing for me
[17:23:31] <Sumida> there is also papico!
[17:23:59] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: can you show a picture of those ice?
[17:24:04] <DunceCotus> papioca

[17:35:05] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: oh a matching site made an ad without reading it. I see
[17:35:07] <HubertFarnsworth> It’s the old trick amigojapan. If you’re meeting someone for first time and want to advance relationship fast, say your worst, darkest things first.
[17:35:51] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: I did that with tomako cause I did not want to have secrets
[17:36:23] <DunceCotus> does microwaving butterflies cause them to turn to plasma
[17:36:26] <DunceCotus> like grapes
[17:36:26] <HubertFarnsworth> Yeah, it’s a good thing otherwise you boil up inside.

[17:38:15] <Sumida> the person in the ad could be a time traveller

[18:30:58] <ButterNoodle> hittit dont quitit
[18:31:15] <blue_rog> there were a few gay guys in my college, so i guess he was considered by them at least?
[18:31:39] <blue_rog> i knew only one of them and he had a boyfriend outside college so he wasn't looking for other dudes
[18:32:11] <blue_rog> were any of you part of the student council of your college / uni?
