[12:21:20] <MootPoot> fortunately I dont mind large phones 
[12:21:36] <MootPoot> screen size is a little bit misleading anyway these days
[12:21:58] <MootPoot> a 5" phone from 2014 is the same actual dimensions as a 6" phone today
[12:22:07] <MootPoot> due to bezel removal
[12:22:29] <MootPoot> for some reason getting the higher RAM version of phones is impossible

[16:28:53] <beaky> what is the most yuri anime
[16:29:03] <bubblemoth_> Yes, KatrinValerie
[16:29:10] <bubblemoth_> I want to relate to them
[16:29:12] <KatrinValerie> but they get a more stereotypical evil guy later on
[16:29:16] <bubblemoth_> Not just hate them
[16:29:17] <mosin_nagant> How do you classify "most yuri"
[16:29:21] <KatrinValerie> but we may just not have seen the depth to his character yet

[19:57:27] <KatrinValerie> I was jabbed in mid august
[19:57:27] <listen_ers> yea and thats why i had sign up at walgreens is cause i read about your booster appointment in chat yesterday
[19:57:40] <listen_ers> i almost beat you to it
[19:58:16] <KatrinValerie> btw, immunity from the booster lasts much longer than double vaccination
[19:58:45] <KatrinValerie> data from isreal and other places suggests that it may be very effective up to 10months or so
[20:00:31] <KatrinValerie> I am much more pessimistic about the political aftermath of this pandemic, than the pandemic itself.
[20:01:07] <Nanobot> The booster is generally recommended to be taken at least 6 months after the second dose.
[20:02:03] <listen_ers> my vaccination card says my last shot was on 5/26/21
[20:02:05] <KatrinValerie> Nanobot: it's possible to do  it earlier

[20:04:07] <KatrinValerie> a vaccination is almost always milder than an infection with these

[20:14:24] <KatrinValerie> That is indeed very scary
[20:14:37] <TsundereNoises> we've had a few outbreaks every year in idiot-dense areas in the last few decades
[20:14:37] <KatrinValerie> Measles are already back here btw, they have never been gone in Germany
[20:14:44] <TsundereNoises> but those have always been really small-scale

[20:18:07] <KatrinValerie> and it works even when you had chickenpox
[20:18:21] <KatrinValerie> TsundereNoises: I am melodramatic about everything

[20:18:46] <KatrinValerie> I just think it sucks, don't think that is being dramatic really
[20:18:48] <TsundereNoises> KatrinValerie: your life seems melodramatic in general
[20:19:08] <TsundereNoises> KatrinValerie: the way you're phrasing things is vastly overstating how bad chicken pox is, that's what I'm saying
[20:19:13] <KatrinValerie> TsundereNoises: that's usually what happens when you have had a very fucked up childhood
[20:19:38] <TsundereNoises> BUT I do think people should get vaccinated, taking pointless risks is dumb
[20:19:45] <KatrinValerie> also, just had some really bad luck in some regards
[20:20:34] <TsundereNoises> and btw, the whole point of the shingles vaccine is for people who had chicken pox, basically everyone my age and older had chicken pox
[20:21:11] <KatrinValerie> TsundereNoises: my sis even got the shingles and not a single GP ever told her the vaccine exists
[20:21:14] <KatrinValerie> it's kinda sad
[20:21:17] <listen_ers> it helps if you have other families with kids to socialize with. kids are really good at communicating with each other maybe since the filter isnt present at those ages.
[20:21:26] <KatrinValerie> It is indicated in people who have frequent breakouts
[20:21:31] <listen_ers> well in the case of chicken pox that is
[20:21:32] <KatrinValerie> as it prevents further nerve damage
[20:21:37] <listen_ers> not about most other things
[20:21:49] <TsundereNoises> getting actual chicken pox late in life is much more likely to be fatal, but you can't get shingles if you didn't previously have chicken pox

[21:11:35] <TsundereNoises> have you read any books by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_C._Scott
[21:11:36] <ImoutoBot> [title] James C. Scott - Wikipedia
[21:11:52] <TsundereNoises> I am considering buying one, and he seems like maybe the kind of person you'd have read
[21:12:31] <MootPoot> coomsumirsm
[21:13:27] <MootPoot> paper books are weird
[21:13:41] <MootPoot> on one hand, they're a waste of tree
[21:13:55] <TsundereNoises> I'm specifically interested in "Against the Grain" which is about the development of agriculture basically, but I'm always wary of history books written by polisci types
[21:14:02] <MootPoot> on the other hand - since its physically present you can like
[21:14:04] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: Fuck trees
[21:14:07] <MootPoot> constntly be reminded it exists
[21:14:10] <TsundereNoises> yes
[21:14:11] <TsundereNoises> exactly
[21:14:13] <MootPoot> until you actually read it
[21:14:15] <TsundereNoises> also easier to reference when you want it
[21:14:25] <MootPoot> is it
[21:14:32] <MootPoot> ctrl+F sounds easier to me
[21:14:37] <TsundereNoises> I VASTLY prefer paper books for the kind of books I might come back and look for some specific part of the book later
[21:14:48] <TsundereNoises> I don't find that it is
[21:15:05] <TsundereNoises> hard to remember a unique word a lot of times
[21:15:21] <TsundereNoises> much easier to flip to a random page and remember it was before or after that
[21:15:57] <TsundereNoises> ctrl + f is great for when you have some specific topic that comes up once or twice in a book and you want that, not for finding a specific bit when the whole book is about it
[21:17:15] <MootPoot> you feel the pain of books when you actually have to deal with it existing
[21:17:24] <emmeka> TsundereNoises I haven't, but am aware of him. I'm aware of that book as being like the bible of anarcho-primitivists. why exactly

[21:18:07] * MootPoot has PTSD from being forced to do manual labour moving his family books around

[21:22:09] <TsundereNoises> Jigsy: I said exactly what I meant
[21:22:21] <MootPoot> you meant exactly what you said?
[21:22:26] <MootPoot> tsun
[21:23:16] <emmeka> TsundereNoises it's not crackpotty, but it is political. The central tenet to it, as I understand it having not read it myself, is that he's arguing against the normative model of the neolithic revolution as a development in productivity, and instead argues that early agricultural states were terrible to live in and people had to be enslaved into them
[21:23:23] <Jigsy> Are Vegans allowed to eat Lab Grown Meat?
[21:23:31] <Jigsy> I mean, it's got the word meat in it...
[21:24:12] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: yeah, and I'm curious how well supported any of that is by archeology, which I suspect I might need to actually read the book and check sources to find out
[21:24:16] <TsundereNoises> but I wondered if you knew
[21:24:39] <TsundereNoises> Jigsy: vegans aren't allowed to eat honey, I'm not sure how much logic comes into it
[21:24:50] <Jigsy> Wait, really?
[21:24:57] <emmeka> TsundereNoises like it's sort of a part of this ideology that hunter gatherer societies were fundamentally better for all involved and that agriculture ruined everything and made states which are terrible, which is anarcho-primitivism.
[21:25:08] <MootPoot> I dont know about logic, I just watch anime
[21:25:16] <TsundereNoises> which is why it's so frustrating people treat it as vegan = healthy (see also: "organic" "gluten-free" "natural")
[21:25:29] <MootPoot> TsundereNoises: well, compared to the average NA diet
[21:25:32] <MootPoot> y'know
[21:25:35] <Jigsy> I don't eat honey, but only because I don't like honey.
[21:25:47] <Jigsy> I'm gluten free.
[21:25:50] <Jigsy> Not out of choice, though.
[21:25:52] <MootPoot> I'm cum free
[21:25:59] <MootPoot> every day
[21:26:07] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: my problem is that it isn't either McDonalds or organic gluten free
[21:26:10] <TsundereNoises> there are other things
[21:26:14] <TsundereNoises> like fucking potatoes
[21:26:22] <Jigsy> McDonalds here is gluten free.
[21:26:25] <TsundereNoises> that are not certified organic
[21:26:26] <Jigsy> Well, aside from the burger rolls.
[21:26:30] <MootPoot> I prefer fucking cabbages, myself.
[21:26:36] <emmeka> I know one of the main things in it is he spends a lot of time focusing on why there was such a huge gap (thousands of years) between the domestication of the first crops and the development of the first agricultural societies, his argument is that people pretty much only farmed as starvation-insurance and that it took military force occupying territory to force people to farm as their primary source of food
[21:26:37] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: to each his own
[21:26:54] <MootPoot> TsundereNoises:  but imo that's where it comes from 
[21:27:07] <emmeka> and that all these people were forced to switch from a perfectly healthy natural hunter-gather diet to a cereal-based on which made everyone malnourished
[21:27:09] <MootPoot> I dont make sense of the gluten free or organic stuff
[21:27:19] <MootPoot> but I think a most normies would be benefited by going vegan
[21:27:23] <MootPoot> or vegetarian
[21:27:33] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: something I'm really curious about is how any of that squares with native american agriculture (I suspect it doesn't but I don't know)
[21:27:43] <emmeka> it doesn't.
[21:27:57] <emmeka> which is ofc a major oversight, but understandable given his area of study
[21:28:10] <emmeka> but tbf, whole notions of agriculture don't square well with how it is/was done here.
[21:28:13] <TsundereNoises> like I was wondering if it was even addressed
[21:28:37] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: vegetarian makes a hell of a lot more sense than vegan for one thing
[21:28:39] <Jigsy> Isn't Nebraska an agriculture square?
[21:28:44] <TsundereNoises> but people treat them as near-synonomous
[21:29:09] <emmeka> Jigsy sure. a land of much corn.
[21:29:49] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: yeah, that's the thing, I don't really think a lot of historical ideas take the americas into account very well
[21:32:15] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: I don't know if I ranted to you about this before, but amazon does not seem to differentiate real history from crazy history
[21:32:45] <MootPoot> catgirl bezos
[21:33:01] <emmeka> I mean a fun example. Are you familiar with the American groundnut, also called the potato bean? It's a leguminous tuber found on riverbanks. There's two genotypes of it, sterile triploids that occur in the north of its range, and diploids in the south of its range that bear beans in addition to its tubers.
[21:33:02] <TsundereNoises> "You're interested in this book on archeology, perhaps you'd also like this book about how the Atlanteans colonized Mexico"

[21:34:54] <emmeka> There's a river where I grew up, that my grandmother owns a cottage on, that is the only known place where diploid groundnuts occur north of the southern states. There's also no rivers nearby it that have any groundnuts of any kind. But that river was a very common portage route to the interior.
[21:35:57] <emmeka> so the theory goes that those who used the river planted them intentionally, and would collect them at their winter camps when spring melts heaved them out of the banks 
[21:35:59] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: interesting, it's apparently a regional speciality in Aomori, Japan

[22:20:29] <TsundereNoises> I love going for walks at night
[22:21:22] <TsundereNoises> I think about -4 C is the perfect temperature for a night walk
[22:22:01] <TsundereNoises> preferably with just a hint of snow and a full moon
[22:22:06] <Bco1981> sounds like you are on your way down a slippery path

[22:28:05] <Bco1981> a few of them can light up, and that's it.
[22:28:33] <TsundereNoises> that's too bad
[22:28:48] <TsundereNoises> is it still better than the one with the active screens?
