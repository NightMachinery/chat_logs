[06:11:32] <lous1F> but it's pretty difficult to insert a fiat paper bill into a computer or mobile telephone to purchase something through the internet. (I've tried, doesn't work)
[06:11:35] <lous1F> lol
[06:18:09] <muhblockchain> that's why coinjoin was made possible. we are slowly making it more user friendly

[15:00:56] <sword_smith> The security of a Bitcoin private key is AFAIK 128 bits, as an attack on an ECDSA private key can be done i sqrt(N) time, and N = 256. But the big-O notation hides constant factors that can be important. Are there any good sources on how hard it actually is to brute a private key?

You cannot know what will happen, but you can know  probability of event. This is basics of quantum mechanics. Think about that
