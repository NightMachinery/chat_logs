[00:13:21] <BenoitRen> Hi there! I'd like some second opinions on how to mark up a section of author's notes contained on the same page as the story itself. One suggestion I've gotten is to use a blockquote element, which isn't bad, but I'm not convinced.

[00:18:28] <entuland> indeed doesn't seem to fit in such a case
[00:20:47] <entuland> you could simply put them in a <footer> - given that you wrap it in a fitting context
[00:21:31] <entuland> there doesn't seem to be anything in particular that would stand out to be used for notes
[00:29:05] <BenoitRen> I guess that means I should move them to after the story. Most of the time the notes are the first thing on the page I'm sourcing from (with permission).
[00:30:49] <BenoitRen> While this does work most of the time, sometimes it's used as a lead-in to the story.
[00:31:15] <entuland> oh that's way different
[00:31:27] <entuland> you should preserve the original order if it matters
[00:31:55] <entuland> but then, if they are a lead-in, you could put them in a <header>
[00:31:58] <BenoitRen> In one instance the note was "Hmmm. I don't think there's much to say about this one. Just read it.".
[00:32:16] <entuland> assuming the wrapping <article> contains the whole story
[00:32:24] <entuland> article or section
[00:33:03] <BenoitRen> Full disclosure: I haven't switched the website over to HTML5 yet.
[00:33:41] <entuland> shouldn't be hard to convert it
[00:34:19] <BenoitRen> I know, but I don't know much about the new elements. article is clear to me, but section I still don't get.
[00:37:01] <BenoitRen> I also find it confusing how pages can now have more than one header and footer.

[00:42:47] <entuland> <section> is just a more generic sectioning element where <article> wouldn't fit properly
[00:43:05] <entuland> say, you can have multiple <article>s inside a single <section>
[00:44:44] <entuland> thinking about your original query again, you could probably use <aside> for the notes

[00:45:59] *** Joins: Haxxa (~Haxxa@122-199-59-136.ip4.superloop.com)
[00:48:11] <BenoitRen> Yeah, that thought also occurred to me.
[00:49:13] <entuland> the advantage of <aside> is that you can throw it pretty much anywhere regardless of where the main story is - you can throw it even in the middle of it
[00:50:47] <BenoitRen> Would it be proper to have it start with "Author's note", or should that be a header of some kind? To be honest, those 'inline headers' always complicate things in my mind.
[00:53:34] <entuland> there are various ways to approach that - you could have "Author's note" put in the content property of a ::before or ::after pseudo element, not to have to directly put it in your HTML markup
[00:54:05] <entuland> to "decorate" it on the rendering without actually adding such a text in the flow
[00:54:33] <entuland> in traditional printing after all such notes are simply rendered with a different font or font size or font style or the alike
[00:55:58] <BenoitRen> Ah, yes, that makes sense.
[00:56:02] <entuland> have a look at the example here: https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wiki/Using_HTML5_aside_element#Example_2:_the_.3Caside.3E_Element_with_ARIA
[00:56:25] <entuland> the w3 group actually makes an <aside role="note"> example there
[00:57:10] <BenoitRen> There's one edge case, though: when the story itself is being treated like a document, and there's an in-universe introduction or addendum.
[01:00:55] <entuland> well in such a case you could use <header> just fine I guess

[22:22:27] <stenno> list-style: none; removes the number prefixes of the ol
[22:25:11] <physkets1> stenno: Oh! Wait, but isn't that line/block commented (or is that not how CSS works?)
[22:25:28] <physkets1> Okay, so then is it an issue with the HUGO theme? Or something else?
