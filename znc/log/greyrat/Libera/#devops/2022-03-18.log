[00:00:02] <slaughter> <3
[00:06:06] <rawtaz> well yeah, one use case is that video conference stuff only work "fully" in chrome, so i have to use that for that. i use safari mainly, for the isolation aspect. i love firefox for its dev tools (much better than chromiums i think), but never use it really.
[00:06:24] <rawtaz> honestly i dont have that strong reasons for using different browsers.. i must admit :)
[00:10:05] <kubblai> rawtaz i find firefox with multiaccount containers (made by mozilla) is more useful since it uses a container for each tab even outside of incognito. however i have issues with certain sites not working on ff such as some aws console stuff. i actually use chromium edge on mac. i do like safari but just little things like not jumping back to last used tab like FF or the chromium addon piss me off. i also find safari a bit poor with quite a few 
[00:10:05] <kubblai> sites. i do love the safari picture in picture mode tho that spans any workspace unlike other browsers (if you can work out how to enable it)
[00:11:46] <rawtaz> hm multi*account* containers? you need firefox account for that?
[00:12:15] <kubblai> no its just an addon, it segregates like profiles but you can have them all running in the same window
[00:12:32] <rawtaz> ah ok
[00:13:16] <rawtaz> oh another thing that annoys the hell out of me is that e.g. with chrome you cant distinguish between different profile's incognito windows. the regular windows have the profile color, but incognito ones are all black. what fricken retarded idiot figured that was a good idea!
[00:13:18] <kubblai> so you could have an account container for customerA aws console, one for prod, one for dev and use them all at once without switching windows or using incognito
[00:16:01] <rawtaz> ah :)
[00:19:11] <slaughter> kubblai what issues do you have with the AWS console in FF? I've never come across anything, myself, but if I do it'd be great to know ahead of time why :p
[00:40:08] <kubblai> rawtaz: i had some issues with some sections of the aws catalogue a few ff versions ago, specifically when loading cf templates into a catalogue i spent ages troubleshooting pemissions etc then realised it worked fine in chrome - it might be fixed but put me off a little
[00:40:41] <kubblai> sorry that was for slaughter 
[00:40:49] <slaughter> :)
[00:41:09] <kubblai> i like annoying rawtaz with unsolicited pings tho
[00:41:10] <slaughter> I can definitively say that CFN templates etc work fine in FF at this point
[00:41:35] <kubblai> yeah that part was fine
[00:41:56] <kubblai> the acct containers was really useful for me in that job since i had so many clients
[00:57:21] <rawtaz> okay so here's a random question to you professionals, before i settle.. is there any reason to NOT go with Ed448 over Ed25519 for a VPN server?
[00:58:13] <rawtaz> the former is a further development of the latter, and its not done by DJB (which did the latter), but DJB does have the former in http://safecurves.cr.yp.to so i would expect that to have DJB's approval :)
[00:59:02] <slaughter> Hmm I don't actually have _experience_ with this question, but my knee jerk answer is "compatibility"
[01:00:00] <kubblai> i only know of ed209 from robocop sorry
[01:00:25] <rawtaz> slaughter: good thinking! both of them are supported in openssl 1.1.1.
[01:01:58] <slaughter> Then, in that case...it's your bed so as long as you're willing to lie in it use the funky one if you want :P
[01:02:09] <rawtaz> one difference (not in terms of VPNs though) is that openssh only implemented Ed25519, not Ed448.
[01:02:20] <rawtaz> slaughter: :)
[01:02:53] <slaughter> Ah in that case don't do that, go for the common one 
[01:03:00] <slaughter> Foot + gun
[01:03:24] <rawtaz> its not really relevant though, in this case it's just for an isolated VPN server and all the involved certificates will be supported by all clients. so really both of them are fine :)
[01:04:04] <rawtaz> im leaning towards Ed448 as it's supposed to be "more secure" than Ed25519, but that only holds true as long as the author didnt mess it up. thats why i tried to see what DJB thinks of it heh
[01:04:19] <rawtaz> kind of trust DJB pretty much on this topic :D
[01:05:01] <rawtaz> that safecurves site was really useful though!
[01:06:05] <rawtaz> i guess noone in here is a cryptographer hehe

[06:09:42] <lantech19446> it's supposed to go on my arm but i have better luck putting it on my stomach

[06:11:14] <lantech19446> yep
[06:11:40] <lantech19446> but i use 3rd party software so I don't have to keep scanning it it just updates every 5 minutes or 1 minute depending on how i set it

[22:00:09] <dodo> lantech19446: cool. my first use case for docker was a python script that needed outdated libs i couldn't install on the host
[22:01:20] <slaughter> That's so much more sensible than mine
[22:01:49] <lantech19446> all I've done is run an instance of busybox and pass it a few commands, I'm not sure what i'll even use it for and I definitely don't know how to many my own images yet
[22:02:32] <slaughter> My first use case for docker (with NO PREVIOUS KNOWLEDGE) was creating a multi-container architecture for wordpress + nginx + something else I forgot, and for some reason I do not recall the desire was to have 3 distinct wordpress containers behind the single nginx one. That sucked ass
[22:02:59] <dodo> a cache perhaps?
[22:03:13] <mns> load balance ? 
[22:03:22] * dodo thinks anything that involves wp sucks ;)
[22:03:41] <dodo> seems like a job for nginx
[22:03:57] <lantech19446> yea when I was interested in webdev I tried to learn wp to pick up some freelance work and was like fuck this
[22:04:10] <dodo> yeah, took me two or three years
[22:04:28] <dodo> and then still a few more because i just kept getting offers for wp work..
[22:04:55] <mns> does that pay enough ? 
[22:05:09] <dodo> i like to say, moving on from php was my best career decision ever
[22:05:15] * mns has to still pick up on docker
[22:05:15] <dodo> mns: it can
[22:05:19] <dodo> but doesn't make you happy
[22:05:56] <dodo> i was doing $80/hr with wp, i know of others who did (much) more
[22:06:33] <slaughter> Wordpress work can be very lucrative once you learn it but good luck with that
[22:06:38] <mns> nah ... that don't sound like its worth it
[22:06:48] <dodo> the more you learn the more you'll hate it ;)
[22:06:52] <slaughter> Thankfully 99% of my WP work at that company was things such as the docker config or EC2 managment
[22:06:55] <mns> I'll keep my job
[22:07:12] <dodo> slaughter: oh, lucky you..
[22:07:22] <slaughter> Not luck, skill
[22:07:25] <dodo> i actually went to the wp core to figure out a few bugs..
[22:07:31] <dodo> fair enough
[22:07:36] <slaughter> I dodged dipped dived ducked and dodged on WP work there
[22:16:45] <lantech19446> I saw wp as an abomination it was slow clunky put together by people who didn't actually understand the purpose of the languages or how to use lighthouse and almost every job was fix this for us so I'd start looking at it and go why the fuck aren't you just running this on httpd
[22:20:38] <slaughter> WP predates lighthouse by (just a guess) 15 years
[22:22:45] <slaughter> Wow almost exactly 15 years

[22:35:48] <rawtaz> that devops thing. i dont get why everyone and their cat is like "i have to get into devops". im noodling around on reddit and almost everyone there is like that.
[22:36:09] <rawtaz> when are people going to understand that its not about a title and devops isnt everything regardless
[22:38:59] <lantech19446> I want to get into it because the thought process around it interests me and the culture of it all does too
[22:39:24] <rawtaz> what thought process is that?
[22:40:21] <lantech19446> ci/cd kaizen team segmentation and cross team cooperation etc we don't have that stuff in small networks especially small underfunded networks
[22:49:24] <slaughter> That's too verbose of a summary IMO
[22:49:47] <rawtaz> "make shit work together" is perhaps a more vague description :P
[22:50:00] <slaughter> "Improving dev and ops efficiency" or some variation thereof is what I tend to baseline on
[22:50:03] <kubblai> rawtaz: i think ppl want to get into devops for the money. i used to be a sysadmin and moved into devops not i've doubled my salary in 2 years
[22:50:19] <kubblai> s/not/now
[22:52:02] <kubblai> i have a devops job title but the company i work for is anything but agile. im basically a sysadmin still in a platform team. i just write tf instead of bash/powershell scripts
[22:52:29] <rawtaz> then youre lucky, having gotten the devops title and more pay while effectively just being the good ol admin
[22:52:33] <kubblai> im not complaining tho, its a good job and money is decent
[22:53:56] <kubblai> the even better thing is im not usually involved in p1's thats the SREs and if shit if infra stuff breaks thats the infra team. so no on call
[23:06:03] <lantech19446> devops is also a whole level of shit above what most sysadmins are exposed too, I never even heard of ansible or docker until I started getting into devops stuff
[23:11:44] <atille> We have a platform team composed of devops and classic sysadmin in a company where we are totally disconnected from the developers. Sometimes the devops term clearly means nothing except "make shit work together" as said by rawtaz
[23:13:00] <rawtaz> lantech19446: i totally see what you mean, so this isnt me dismissing your point, but i'd like to point out that docker and ansible really doesnt have much to do with devops in particular :) its just tools that non-devops should use too
[23:13:32] <rawtaz> i think the number of people who understands devops *properly* are quite few in this world lol. im not one of them!
[23:14:32] <lantech19446> I agree that it should exist outside of devops too but for some reason it hasn't permeated, I'm thrilled to be learning about them because I implement them on my network and they've made my life so much easier and I've become much better at my job with them

[23:15:06] <atille> especially sysadmins, to start automate things and stop dealing with weird corner cases
[23:15:20] <rawtaz> i use docker because i write code. and because i run stuff on servers
[23:15:25] <rawtaz> but it started with the code
[23:16:42] <atille> not required to follow the whole devops cycle. Yeah rawtaz that is the good path, using those softwares to make your life easier imo. I too started with the code and it was so cool I finally went to the admin side :D
[23:16:47] <rawtaz> lantech19446: but yeah those two are good choices
[23:17:09] <rawtaz> atille: what type of dev did you do at that point?
[23:18:11] <atille> from system-oriented programming to APIs, basically. I still do at work, sometimes
[23:18:26] <rawtaz> using what stack?
[23:19:06] <atille> the one that works depending on the context :) go, ruby, python, Ada mainly
[23:19:16] <rawtaz> i stopped reading at Go
[23:19:19] <rawtaz> what else would you need
[23:19:23] <rawtaz> (besides Elixir)
[23:19:30] <rawtaz> Ada, really? what did you use that for?
[23:20:17] <atille> I don't care about the languages that much and I follow the orders chief
[23:20:53] <justsomeguy> Design-by-contract is pretty interesting.
[23:21:10] <rawtaz> spekaing of chief, i wonder how the polish one is doing. he's been much less active here lately
[23:25:55] <atille> rawtaz yeah Ada, with some weird old-school projects based on aws
[23:26:22] <rawtaz> fun :)
