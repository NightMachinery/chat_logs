[01:44:45] <arh> Hello people. This is urgent for me so I appreciate if someone can help me. I want to let someone login to my Ubuntu 20.04 VPS using their SSH key. I added their keys to authorized_keys file and changed the permission of .ssh folder and the authorized_keys files to 700 and 600. Now they should be able to login right? But when I type ssh IP, it asks me for password, but when I type ssh ubuntu@IP, it doesn't require a password and logs in but I can't use the
[01:44:45] <arh> sudo command.
[01:45:04] <arh> I changed the permissions using this command: $ chmod 700 -R ~/.ssh && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
[01:45:56] <arh> When I want to reboot or do some stuff, it says permission denied. So I think there's still need for sudo and therefore a password.
[01:45:59] <arh> How can I fix this?

[01:56:22] <tomreyn> arh: so, there are mostly two commonly used authentication methods for the connection from a local computer to a remote ssh server: one is (ssh) password authentication, i.e. the password is sent to the ssh server and it checks whether this matches the password of the remote (on server) user you are trying to login to. and then there is key authentication, where your ssh client uses your locally stored ssh private key to authenticate to the
[01:56:22] <tomreyn> server as the given user. for this to work, the server must already have the public pkey of this ssh key pair, stored in the target users' ~/.ssh/authorized_keys - and the target user must be able to read this public key. an ssh private key *may* have an additional password on it, i.e. be locally encrypted with a password to safeguard against someone getting access to your computer just copying it.
[01:57:30] <cuddylier> I've upgraded my Ubuntu 20.04 to 5.14.14 kernel but I need to use turbostat and it requires the linux-tools package for the kernel. I cannot find a tools package for the 5.14.14-051414 kernel, does one not exist?
[01:57:35] <tomreyn> arh: and then there is sudo on the server, which may be set up to require the executing users' password to carry out administrative tasks. that's how ubuntu usually sets up the first user.

[01:59:22] <ravage> cuddylier: 5.14 is not a supported kernel on 20.04. so there is no such package
[01:59:31] <arh> tomreyn, so I have to give them the user's password to let them use sudo, right?
[02:00:26] <arh> Actually, I should change the root password, right?
[02:00:36] <arh> sudo passwd root
[02:00:48] <arh> And then give the password to that person.
[02:00:56] <arh> Is it correct tomreyn?
[02:01:25] <tomreyn> arh: with this explained, looking at your questions, you seem to be working on some different issues: (1) which  is the right remote user to login to, for you, and (possibly a different one) for the other person you are trying to grant access? (2) should your or the uother person's remote user be able to run administrative commands (as root) through sudo? and if so, should sudo prompt them for their remote users' password? (3) how do you install
[02:01:25] <tomreyn> the ssh public key of this other person you want to grant access, and on which remote user.
[02:01:52] <tomreyn> arh: there should be no root password normally.

[02:04:00] <arh> Ah OK.
[02:04:26] <rfm> arh, and you can put e.g. "theiruser ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" in /etc/sudoers (or a file in /etc/sudoers.d), then they could sudo without a password.  (This is what the AWS ubuntu images do...)

[07:02:55] <Sven_vB> yeah inspired by that :)
[07:03:17] <Sven_vB> thinking of it, is there a way to boot into another ramdisk instead of halting? then I could even do fancy things like play a sound and then send a network message to a wifi-enabled wall socket to cut power there.
[07:04:05] <Sven_vB> or maybe can I just return control back to GRUB?
[07:04:20] <Sven_vB> because at that point I know how to make GRUB boot that ramdisk.

[07:05:53] <Sven_vB> setting a grubenv flag and then rebooting would achieve the ramdisk boot but would wipe the systemd log messages. and my BIOS would waste about 2 minutes trying to detect USB stuff.

[08:51:24] <Sircle> any clues?
[08:51:43] <alkisg> That's a youtube video showing that someone got stuck while booting windows, right?
[08:51:48] <alkisg> This is an ubuntu channel, we don't know windows...
[08:52:06] <Sircle> yes, exactly my case
[08:52:07] <alkisg> Ventoy is not an ubuntu package; if you need help with ventoy, try its github bug tracker
[08:52:18] <Sircle> ok. thanks!
[08:52:22] <alkisg> np
[08:52:46] <Sircle> alkisg but my point was, I used dd also. maybe there might be something I didn't knew and realted to linux
[08:53:50] <alkisg> Sircle: windows.iso's don't work with dd
[08:54:00] <alkisg> The problem is in the .isos, not in the dd
[08:54:01] <Sircle> alkisg why?
[08:54:12] <alkisg> They're not "hybrid" like linux isos
[08:54:19] <alkisg> Microsoft didn't make them that way
[08:54:48] <alkisg> That's why microsoft has a special "media creator" tool; for more, you'd need to ask in #windows
[08:54:56] <MrConorAE> i have a problem

[08:55:58] <MrConorAE> what's going on? i've tried other ports and restarting, and nothing fixed it
[08:56:18] <MrConorAE> the light on the drive is on and I can hear the disk spinning

[08:56:38] <MrConorAE> yes
[08:56:41] <MrConorAE> pi4 headless
[08:56:51] <alkisg> Try in #raspberrypi or #raspbian or #raspios

[20:44:06] <tomreyn> computerjoe314: on a HP laptop i use, which also uses an InsydeH2O UEFI "BIOS", and is configured to boot ubuntu 20.04 in uefi mode from a gpt partitioned nvme, i have created /boot/efi/EFI/HP/DEVFW/ and placed the firmware .bin file there (so /EFI/HP/DEVFW/ on the efi system partition on the nvme). when i reboot the system, press F9 for the boot menu or directly F10 for the bios setup, i can navigate to a bios update option. when i select this,
[20:44:06] <tomreyn> it immediately sstarts the bios update from this file.
[20:44:45] <tomreyn> that's a different path than this forum post says, though.
[20:44:53] <computerjoe314> I can try it
[20:45:13] <computerjoe314> Rename the file to firmware.bin or retain the original name?
[20:45:16] <tomreyn> you could also try a gpt on the usb stick, maybe i was wrong saying that mbr would also work
[20:45:34] <tomreyn> in my caseit must be called firmware.bin
[20:45:49] <computerjoe314> I'll try that first, if not that then I'll try with gpt

[22:28:08] *** Joins: Sven_vB (~sven@user/sven-vb/x-2094958)
[22:29:00] <tomreyn> in fact you're first saying that you did not modify PATH, then you say you did. i can't follow.
[22:29:38] <oerheks> ' Bash script does not seem to be following the path changes...' .. why would it?
[22:29:43] <the_actor> tomreyn: I am not sure. The script is in the user's home dir, so in order to work on the target files it needs to cd.
[22:30:54] <the_actor> tomreyn: Forgive me for being unclear. I have not set a modification to the system path. I pnly change path as required with the cd command in the script as needed.
