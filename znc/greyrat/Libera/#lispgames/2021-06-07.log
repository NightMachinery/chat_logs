[18:28:27] <ln43> hello borodust: how is it going ? 
[18:28:54] <borodust> all good thanks! how are you?
[18:29:49] <ln43> quite good.. if alpine installation worked then would be better

[20:41:52] <borodust> TatriX: nope
[20:42:31] <borodust> but generally speaking, gamekit ain't for games where you care about performance xD
[20:42:44] <borodust> it's for quick prototyping, jam games etc
[20:44:51] <borodust> i didn't give much attention to optimizations and it actually conses in game loop
[20:44:52] <borodust> so
[20:44:53] <borodust> :)
[20:48:16] <borodust> with alien-works i'm going for more classic approach to game engineering with performance being the important goal
[20:48:39] <borodust> no consing + simd math + pbr
[20:49:23] <borodust> very excited to integrate Bagger's GLSL compiler for alien-works materials
[20:49:32] <borodust> err, Baggers'
[20:50:08] <borodust> more like translator/transpiler i guess

[23:39:49] <borodust> noice :)
[23:41:45] <borodust> defaultxr uses cl-bodge and gamekit too (or did use) - could be there are some libs that bridge cl-collider and gamekit/bodge in unexpected ways :)
[23:45:42] <Porta_Potty> How have you been borodust? It's me P_O masquerading as a totally inconspicuous construction grade portable outhouse.
[23:48:29] <borodust> ohh
[23:48:30] <borodust> ;p
[23:49:28] <borodust> hi masquearaded Pixel_Outlaw :)
[23:49:39] <borodust> took me a minute to write that second word
[23:50:25] <Porta_Potty> I might have to take a test of your GUI library again. You seperated it out if I recall so it can stand alone.
[23:50:31] <borodust> Porta_Potty: busy lately, still pumping lisp into github, kinda slowish though)
[23:50:45] <borodust> Porta_Potty: are you maso?
[23:50:50] <borodust> XD
[23:51:06] <Porta_Potty> "maso"?
[23:51:14] <borodust> i think you forgot how it looked like for a reason :D
[23:51:48] <borodust> masochisuto
[23:52:07] <Porta_Potty> Oh masochistic? Nah. I do love a gui with bevels and such the flat low contrast stuff causes me to write walls of complaints into twitter in false hopes that people over 18 will rise up but alas....
[23:52:58] <borodust> well
[23:54:11] <borodust> the thing is, im gui libraries like nuklear and dear imgui (that's the name) are more suited for debug interfaces
[23:54:25] <borodust> and some graphical in-app interfaces
[23:54:34] <borodust> like game engines, CAD software..
[23:55:34] <borodust> they render in a loop, basically
[23:55:56] <borodust> and most often than not require proper graphics context like opengl
[23:56:08] <borodust> *opengl's one
[23:56:47] <Porta_Potty> That's perfect for this little tool I'm debating making.
[23:56:54] <borodust> if that's ok, sure, it's bodge-ui or bodge-ui-window :)
[23:57:17] <borodust> bodge-ui is incomplete
[23:57:47] <borodust> if you would like to add more to it, you need to know how nuklear (C lib) works
[23:58:40] <borodust> it's so much pita to work with that Baggers was constantly postponing the stream about it :)
[23:59:48] <Porta_Potty> Aww tried to run your example but it killed the REPL saying it was closed by remote peer.
