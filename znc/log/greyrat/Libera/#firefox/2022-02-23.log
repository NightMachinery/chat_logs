[05:12:30] <nerdcore> is there any way to reduce extra space from the tabs, URL, and Bookmarks toolbars? I find I have lost too much of my monitor to extra space around these toolbars
[05:13:14] <nerdcore> too much vertical padding in particular
[05:13:35] <mefistofeles> there are ways
[05:14:14] <nerdcore> I've tried different Themes but they all seem the same size
[05:15:11] <nerdcore> what are the ways?
[05:15:38] <mefistofeles> nerdcore: maybe this helps https://superuser.com/questions/1653533/how-to-switch-back-to-firefox-old-style-of-tabs 
[05:15:51] <mefistofeles> it sounds like a pain with recent versions of firefox, btw

[05:37:06] <nerdcore> and how do I know which of padding, margin, line-height, min-height, spacing, or any other attricutes need to change in order to achieve my desired effect?
[05:37:38] <akik>  nerdcore: take one and try it
[05:37:52] <nerdcore> yikes
[05:38:18] <akik> i got those tabs fixed
[05:39:36] <nerdcore> i have a working userChrome.css now but those code blocks aren't achieving my desired result; there is still too much extra space vertically in the tabs, URL, and Bookmarks toolbars
[05:40:43] <nerdcore> in fact there seems to now be a new extra white vertical space which was not previously there, so I've so far lost more viewport area than before :(
[05:41:14] <nerdcore> in fact, is there any way to just disable tabs in FF altogether?

[11:55:54] <freakynl> Hi, after updating a certificate in way too old java 6 software we can no longer connect. I'm fine with that (customer should have updated their antiquated java 6 u45 years ago), I'm having some issues finding why. Everywhere it's mentioned that TLS 1.0 (/1.1) support is removed in recent firefox/chrome/edge versions, but no mention of that being tied to certificate date. What has changed is the 
[11:56:00] <freakynl> certificate. With the old certificate it works, with the new one it doesn't. Seems like it's tied to the certificate date thus. Is that the case and is it documented somewhere? What to point the customer to it ;)
[11:57:06] <Cork> freakynl: certificates can use too old ciphers
[11:57:42] <Cork> but ya, tls < 1.2 has been disabled for a while now

[12:11:42] <freakynl> Yea I know, but the ciphers didn't change, the certificate did. Certificates don't dictate ciphers (well, ECDSA keys vs RSA keys do, but old and new are both 2048b RSA). They still use firefox 91.5. Old cert is fine, new one is not. Doesn't work with 97 regardless of the old or new certs (same with chrome 98)

[19:08:38] <andrade> I don't know. If Firefox gets its root certificates from the OS maybe that's why I'm not getting an error, if you're using a different OS, that is.
[19:09:12] <andrade> Also that website says "certificate chain is incomplete" when I clicked it.
[19:09:12] <susi> the issue seems to be the intermediate cert, root ca is in my trust store too
[19:09:18] <akik> susi: i get that certificate error
[19:10:24] <akik> didn't firefox earlier include the ca certificate tabs
[19:10:34] <akik> now i just see that server certificate
[19:11:20] <akik> yes i can see ca certificates on other sites
[19:16:37] <andrade> I have the Certainly Something cert viwer extension in FF and shows all three certs: tvo, issued by Thawte EV RSA CA 2018, issued by DigiCert root.
[19:17:01] <akik> i just use the built-in certificate viewer
[19:18:46] <andrade> that works too... don't remember why I installed the addon in the first place

[19:21:40] <andrade> When you expand certification path it shows intermediate cert as extra download.
[19:24:06] <andrade> Maybe OP needs to install intermediate cert + website cert: "... then you are required to add your website’s SSL certificate along with the intermediate certificate (in some cases, the Private Key is needed as well). So, if you miss installing the intermediate certificate or upload the wrong one, then it can not be chained back and the browsers will not trust the certificate and may generate a broken chain or similar sort of warnings."

[19:46:47] <MJCD> I grew up starting on something like 2200bps baud
[19:46:54] <MJCD> and every step upwards from there
[19:46:55] <nemo> heh. my first one was 600 😉
[19:46:59] <MJCD> and it's definitely very complex
[19:47:09] <nemo> but again. ram cache is basically the intermediate step for any network file
[19:47:10] <MJCD> more complex than just 100% faster vs 100% slower
[19:47:17] <nemo> I guess I could believe that a disc cache could be slower
[19:47:17] <MJCD> nothing is ram cache virtually
[19:47:19] <MJCD> and even then
[19:47:32] <nemo> but even disc caches are often ram backed
[19:47:34] <MJCD> it's /very complicated/ using current etagging etc
[19:47:41] <MJCD> it takes literal seconds
[19:47:46] <nemo> well. etagging sure. etagging is the way to get around the utter mess that caching is
[19:48:02] <nemo> but then. the whole point of etag is to *enable* good, reliable, caching
[19:48:16] <nemo> seconds sounds absolutely insane
[19:48:22] <nemo> unless something is seriously wrong with your filesystem
[19:48:46] <nemo> I mean, sure, NTFS+windows is orders of magnitude slower than linux. but still
[19:49:12] <nemo> maybe... large directory structure + NTFS? but you'd think mozilla would've avoided that decades ago

[19:49:51] <nemo> that seems nutty but believable
[19:49:53] <MJCD> there's no way around it
[19:50:07] <MJCD> I can load google.com with caching disabled in maybe 0.3s
[19:50:16] <MJCD> with caching, maybe 1.3s 
[19:50:28] <nemo> MJCD: m'k... hang on. let me fire up a clean profile and do your testcase
[19:50:32] <MJCD> just as an example, and honestly I picked a pretty bad time to bring it up
[19:50:33] <nemo> there's a "disable cache" in debugger.
[19:50:36] <nemo> I will use that to validate
[19:50:38] <MJCD> because it's a pretty big topic
[19:50:45] <MJCD> and I used the startup flag personally
[19:50:56] <MJCD> but moreso this is based on a lotttt of web dev experience
[19:51:05] <nemo> sure. it's a big topic, but it seems like your approach to it is pretty fuzzy
[19:51:09] <MJCD> and also it's worse the more complex it is
[19:51:19] <MJCD> ie facebook.com with a timeline feed vs google.com
[19:51:37] <MJCD> if facebook were smart (they aren't) they'd cache-break very often
[19:51:42] <MJCD> intentionally
[19:52:00] <MJCD> and the techs have  barely changed since <inception>
[19:52:06] <MJCD> beyond minor optimizations 
[19:52:16] <nemo> I've been doing web dev a very very long time too 😉  I've read ohhhh so many articles on optimisation. image packing, script packing. so many things obsoleted by later tech
[19:52:27] <nemo> I'm looking for something concrete in what you've said so far
[19:52:32] <nemo> I'll start by checking your google testcase
[19:52:36] <nemo> I'm going to use firefox stable
[19:52:39] <nemo> and a clean profile
[19:55:05] <nemo> Initial Google load
[19:55:10] <nemo> 36 requests 2.20 MB / 842.83 KB transferred.  Finish: 13.70 s  DOMContentLoaded 509ms  load: 1.16 s
[19:55:14] <nemo> Cached Google load
[19:55:17] <nemo> 18 requests  1.36 MB / 441.04 KB transferred   Finish: 2.72 s  DOMContentLoaded: 151 ms  load: 379 ms
[19:55:20] <nemo> sooo yeah
[19:55:35] <nemo> one more refresh, with Disable Cache checked
[19:55:43] <MJCD> and it's really not a micro-optimization issue fwiw
[19:55:53] <MJCD> I mean it can be if the thing makes it a thing for them
[19:56:05] <MJCD> but inherently it's not about that subjectively
[19:56:13] <MJCD> for my $$
[19:56:39] <MJCD> they already auto/immediately trigger a request even if it ends up using 100% of the cached stuff
[19:56:54] <MJCD> a dynamic timeout on the cache is realistically probably all that's required
[19:57:12] <MJCD> so the page isn't hanging for cache, when it's already infact fully loaded beyond rendering it
[19:57:32] <nemo> wjat
[19:57:40] <nemo> what's screwing with my test is google is rendering differently the 2nd time
[19:57:44] <nemo> due to dark theme detection
