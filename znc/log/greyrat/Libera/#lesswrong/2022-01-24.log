[00:30:06] <gwern> 'have you tried solving the problem?'
[00:35:06] <feepbot> <gwern> 'It is thus likely that there exist ways of interconnecting gates made with known techniques which would result in behavior effectively equivalent to that of human nervous systems. Using a million I2L gates, or 10 thousand Josephson junction gates, and a trillion bits of slower bulk storage, all running at full speed, such assemblies would consume as little as, or less
[00:35:07] <feepbot> than, the power needed to operate a brain of the conventional type. Past performance indicates that the amount of human and electronic compute power available is inadequate to design such an assembly within the next few years. The problem is much reduced if the components used are suitable large subassemblies. Statements of good high level computer languages are the most effective
[00:35:07] <feepbot> such modularizations yet discovered, and are probably the quickest route to human equivalence, if the necessary raw processing power can be accessed through them. This section has indicated that a million times the power of typical existing machines is required. The next suggests this should be available at reasonable cost in about ten years.' <-- well, that didn't happen

[01:11:00] <catern> or are you saying that that article has the same point?
[01:12:16] <gwern> I think it makes many of the same points in a much more entertaining and memorable way
[01:12:20] <gwern> maybe not as useful
[01:15:37] <catern> i'll meditate upon this. perhaps my article is not being radical or surprising enough, because I think it's a pretty different point about how you should be willing to make deep changes to solve problems

[02:50:44] <pompolic> my guess would be something like, "works if you can, at the limit, construct an entire fake reality faster than the reader can spot inconsistencies", but i don't understand why i see it as a synchronous process

[02:55:23] <pompolic> also, reading grognor's posts, i'm kind of sad now. i would have had questions

[02:57:02] <Gurkenglas> *writeup
[03:01:48] <mst> pompolic: honestly I always assumed badbrains was what he was going to die of and lots of us tried to change the course and it ... didn't even come close to working :/
[03:02:38] <pompolic> i only got to know-ish him (twitter mutuals i think) towards the tail end
[03:02:48] <pompolic> and back then i was less knowledgeable
[03:03:09] <pompolic> it's exactly that since then i had distilled more of my toolbox wrt things in this domain
[03:03:32] <pompolic> so i would have questions now that i couldn't have asked back then
[03:04:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... so I just thought "I should buy a couple more of these 'DVI Dummy' emulator plugs before they disappear", went to Amazon, and ... too late :(
[03:05:20] <saturn2> computer screens need dummy plugs? i didn't even know they had pilots
[03:05:22] <pompolic> i like to think by now i have some knowledge of fighting bad executive function from the inside
[03:05:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh but other people make them now, nice. I guess because mining is popular now
[03:05:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Not the screens but the graphics cards
[03:05:58] <saturn2> oh, they don't work without something plugged in?
[03:06:00] <pompolic> tl;dr someone is wrong on the internet but he is also dead :(
[03:06:33] <Gurkenglas> (*reads up on confounding* huh, failure to generalize due to a biased user sample is not actually called being confounded.)
[03:06:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Just so
[03:06:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: So there's no graphics output and you can't e.g. VNC into it, etc.
[03:06:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> The dummy plug solves that
[03:07:01] <saturn2> wow, how dumb
[03:07:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> This problem is like 3 decades old, too
[03:07:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> People used to like cut off 25pin connectors off cables back in the day

[03:09:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> pompolic: In fact there's even another layer of dumb: on a Mac, at least, if you VNC into a box that's plugged into a monitor but that monitor is turned off, you *do* get a picture but it's not GPU-accelerated and the CPU renders your UI and such
[03:09:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> pompolic: Turn the monitor on and suddenly your VNC graphics performance soars!

[03:10:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> I'm sure someone somewhere has what they think is a good reason
[03:10:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like saving power or some shit
[03:10:30] <pompolic> kind of like the optimus shit on laptops
[03:10:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway, so nowadays people use stuff like https://www.amazon.com/Headless-Graphics-Emulator-Detection-Adapter1920x1080/dp/B08RCHGTXP

[03:11:31] <saturn2> this seems to not be necessary with linux
[03:11:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> pompolic: The problem is that some OSes don't even start without the GPU active, lol
[03:11:56] <saturn2> score one for open sores
[03:12:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like macOS will not start the windowserver if you don't have an active and working graphics processor
[03:12:20] <pompolic> mst: to further belabor the point, the things he describes in his akrasiapost, some of those i've found analogues of. some of the subset of that I've solved
[03:12:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> And that means no loginwindow, etc., and that means you can't do shit
[03:12:39] <pompolic> some subset of those*
[03:12:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> So yeah I guess score one for etc.?
[03:13:12] <pompolic> love when the computer tries to be smart
[03:13:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Of course your GPU is still inactive even if that doesn't prevent your OS from being e.g. ssh'able into etc.
[03:13:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: So btc miners still need it, Linux or no
[03:14:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> Some OSes used to do this with keyboards too
[03:14:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> Windows did
[03:14:10] <saturn2> no, you can create a virtual display that renders into the GPU memory with no output
[03:14:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> hmm ok

[03:18:18] <pompolic> most of them are worthless anyway
[03:18:33] <pompolic> that is to say, i agree with him on unsolicited advice
[03:19:34] <mst> I don't generally do unsolicited -advice-, I make it explicit what I'm doing if throwing out ideas into the aether and anybody hearing them should treat them as no more than that
[03:20:38] <pompolic> right. regarding the worth of advice, I'm thinking it's hard to communicate specificities of the situation and personal idiosyncracies

[03:35:08] <pompolic> the virgin gell-mann amnesia, vs. the chad "...to correlate all its contents"

[03:40:49] <pompolic> catern: i read your problem solving post. this might be a tall order and i'm literally dumping my surface thoughts, but: i think i would like to see more of a methodology for broad search. as if, heuristics to answer the question, "what constraint would be the best to Unsee to efficiently solve the problem"
[03:42:32] <pompolic> that's kind of what i do when i'm hacking something, but in a very intuitive way, trying to feel out what constraint is the "loosest" (read: biggest ROI wrt exploding my option-space)
[03:45:36] <spxtr> Okay C pop quiz: what does this print: https://gist.github.com/spxtr/08d7a5c6dee5f2e32bf6301338cb648d
[03:45:37] <Robomot> what does this print? · GitHub
[03:46:51] <saturn2> pompolic: you could start by assuming the problem is gone, and then work backwards until you find a contradiction
[03:47:02] <gwern> one of these days someone is just going to post Hello World and ask that question, and the C programmers will get more and more paranoid until they actually compile & run the code
[03:47:45] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: of course, feedback like this also just encourages me to think, 'what could make it even better for readers...'
[03:47:51] <saturn2> it prints "using C is a terrible idea, what are you even doing"
[03:48:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Heh
[03:48:37] <rmmh> spxtr: I'm assuming line 11 is not intuitive and does some bs pointer arithmetic that clears the second word
[03:49:28] <spxtr> rmmh: that is the line that does something non intuitive
[03:49:51] <spxtr> I suppose it *could* clear the second word ;)
[03:52:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> How do I get get the "key fingerprint" of an ssh key I have
[03:52:45] <pompolic> saturn2: i'm not sure if this is genius, a shitpost, or both
[03:54:01] <spxtr> (the answer is basically what saturn2 said. char *foo = "abc"; foo[1] = 0; is UB, as string literals are const and may be in read-only memory. on my machine it's a segfault)
[03:54:22] <pompolic> something, something, reframing everything as navigation problem then using A* on worldstate-space
[03:54:29] <spxtr> (note that char foo[] = "abc"; foo[1] = 0; is perfectly fine. don't use c)
[03:56:37] <pompolic> shouldn't the complier complain about *foo = "abc" discarding a const qualifier?
[03:56:56] <pompolic> compiler*
[03:57:05] <pompolic> i guess it wouldn't complain if it's a complier
[03:58:01] <saturn2> gcc with -Wall gives me "warning: return type of ‘main’ is not ‘int’"
[03:58:10] <saturn2> thanks for nothing
[03:58:33] <spxtr> maybe there's some flag to turn that on? at least for me -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic doesn't warn
[03:59:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hm
[03:59:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> I have ssh public key configured but I'm still being asked for a pw when I ssh
[03:59:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> How... do I troubleshoot this
[03:59:56] <spxtr> what ssh agent are you using?
[04:00:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like what client? Or?
[04:00:32] <saturn2> try ssh -v
[04:00:50] <catern> pompolic: thanks!
[04:01:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: That just prints usage info
[04:01:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> Doesn't give me any version
[04:01:20] <spxtr> Obormot\Arcturus: no I mean like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ssh-agent
[04:01:21] <Robomot> ssh-agent - Wikipedia (Secure Shell (SSH) is a protocol allowing secure remote login to a computer on a network using public-key cryptography. SSH client programs (such as ssh from OpenSSH) typically run for the duration of a remote login session and are configured to look for the user's private key in a file in the user's home directory (e.g., .ssh/id_rsa). For added security (for instance, against an attacker …)
[04:01:23] <catern> Obormot\Arcturus: invoke the full ssh command with -v
[04:01:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> oh thx
[04:01:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> spxtr: I have no idea what you're asking
[04:02:16] <pompolic> catern: o7
[04:02:31] <spxtr> Obormot\Arcturus: maybe I'm misunderstanding, but usually you run ssh-agent so that you only get asked the password once per login. then for future connections it remembers your credentials.
[04:04:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> This is -v output https://share.obormot.net/textfiles/Zhyq5EtS
[04:04:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> spxtr: What? No
[04:04:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> spxtr: The whole point of the public key thing is so I get asked the password zero times per login, or ever
[04:07:13] <catern> Obormot\Arcturus: you may pass -v multiple times to get more verbose info
[04:07:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> hmm
[04:07:41] <saturn2> Obormot\Arcturus: it appears that the server has rejected your key
[04:07:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> I see
[04:08:58] <saturn2> one common problem is that sshd will refuse to honor keys with the permissions are wrong on the key file or any parent directory
[04:09:09] <saturn2> s/with/when/
[04:09:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: That's on the remote host right
[04:09:20] <saturn2> yeah
[04:09:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> That can't be the problem here
[04:09:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> Because on NFSN you don't actually put a key in your homedir, you upload it via their web tool
[04:09:43] <spxtr> Obormot\Arcturus: Oh, is your private key not password protected? Ignore what I said if so.
[04:10:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> So one must assume their stuff handles all the permissions and what have you
[04:10:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's gotta be on my end
[04:10:10] <saturn2> well..... in that case i'm out of ideas :/
[04:10:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> They say
[04:10:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> "If you use an RSA key, you must use a client that supports RFC8332 for SHA-256 (rsa-sha2-256) and SHA-512 (rsa-sha2-512) signatures. As of 2021, our servers no longer accept RSA keys with SHA-1 signatures because they are demonstrably insecure. If you run into that issue, please update your OpenSSH client and/or consider switching to faster, safer Ed25519 keys."
[04:10:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> How can I tell whether this is happening to me
[04:12:54] <pompolic> if you look into your pubkey file, there should be a header telling you if it's a RSA key
[04:13:02] <pompolic> it's also like 4 lines of base64
[04:13:30] <Obormot\Gaia> Yes but is it SHA-1
[04:13:34] <Obormot\Gaia> That is the question
[04:13:53] <pompolic> right. i'm trying to remember if openssh can parse the key for you
[04:13:54] <Obormot\Gaia> Yes the pubkey file says "ssh-rsa"
[04:14:18] <Obormot\Gaia> Maybe alternate question, how in fact do I generate one of these fancy new key types
[04:14:21] <Obormot\Gaia> Like edwhatever
[04:15:12] <pompolic> ssh-keygen -t ed25519 
[04:19:35] <pompolic> oh, the choice of signing algorithm is probably client configuration, and not determined by the key itself, but now i'm not sure. i am noticing my confusion

[04:29:20] <rmmh> that's a pretty fancy way to say "we taped some slides together lol" 
[04:29:47] <spxtr> galambo: it says that on that site, and it interested me. I remember learning somewhere that that is true in the UK but not in newer buildings in the USA.
[04:30:09] <saturn2> i imagine it depends on your water heater
[04:30:26] <galambo> spxtr, when I asked people in the UK they said dont drink the hot water it has pigeon poop in it

[04:40:47] <Betawolf> there's nothing wrong with the water

[04:42:43] <galambo> Betawolf, you say this but most uk sinks have separate hot and cold taps
[04:43:28] <galambo> which means either they are separate because of stupid design choices, or because the hot water tap is indeed not clean
[04:43:40] <galambo> either way its crap
[04:43:49] <Betawolf> you mean separate because of good design choices
[04:44:13] <galambo> yes if by good you mean bad
[04:44:21] <Betawolf> given you either want cold water or hot water, not random lukewarm water
[04:44:43] <galambo> but you see I CAN get hot or cold water if you combine them
[04:44:46] <galambo> or anything in between
[04:44:55] <galambo> I dont lose anything
[04:46:32] <galambo> Betawolf, and no when I wash my hands after I see patients
[04:46:44] <galambo> I have to choose between scalding my hands
[04:46:47] <galambo> or icy cold water
[04:47:00] <galambo> so in this case I prefer lukewarm water
[04:47:04] <spxtr> best to go one hand scalding and the other frozen, then quickly switch back and forth

[04:51:10] * gwern sighs remembering trying to wash dishes in his oxford airbnb after discovering the two-tap system
[04:51:56] <Betawolf> your confusion is probably due to you trying to wash up like an American by running the water away the whole time
[04:52:12] <spxtr> with dishes you can just fill the basin
[04:52:20] <spxtr> it's strictly worse for hand washing, though
[04:52:45] <gwern> I don't think it had a stopper or anything. I did wash dishes that way when I was younger so it would've occurred to me if there had been an obvious stopper
[04:53:16] <gwern> super overkill for 1 plate and fork and saucepan tho
[04:56:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: I am not sure how practical that is... anyway is that really the issue?

[07:23:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Isn't this the one that broke when you zoomed?
[07:24:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well I will test it I guess... but I am pretty sure it's that
[07:25:34] <gwern> if it is, I really need to add something to the docs to explain why that doesn't fix it
[07:26:36] <quanticle> gwern: re: Quarto, does it inherit Pandoc's limitations when exporting to LaTeX?

[07:40:36] <feepbot> <gwern> https://www.bryanbraun.com/anchorjs/ hm... I don't think readers need to deeplink stuff on gwern.net *that* much. I hardly ever see people even using section links
[07:40:37] <Robomot> AnchorJS - Add deep anchor links to your docs (AnchorJS lets you drop deep anchor links onto any webpage. It's lightweight, accessible, and dependency-free.)
[07:43:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> I have auto-anchoring enabled on OborWiki... it's moderately useful... but for headings
[07:43:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> Paragraphs? Nah who does that
[07:44:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyone who is inclined to do such a thing is likely gonna go right for Chrome's text snippet link thing
[07:44:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> I mean this is a cool project and in a perfect world it'd get lots of use
[07:44:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> In practice, unlikely
[07:52:34] <quanticle> I've pasted a deep-link to a particular paragraph only once, I think. I was helping a co-worker with some Python and I sent him a link to a particular paragraph in the documentation for pathlib. That's the only time I've ever found paragraph-level anchors to be useful.
[07:58:57] <gwern> (hm... _Kizumonogatari_ was... alright. I think I hyped it up in my mind for too many years)
[08:08:33] <pompolic> i've seen quotes, quasiquotes, whatever lisp does, but i'd never have thought i'd see "GET OUT OF THE CAR" as a quote token
[08:12:09] <quanticle> Well, it makes more sense than GET OUT OF THE CDR
[08:14:21] <adiabatic> "Anyone who is inclined to do such a thing is likely gonna go right for Chrome's text snippet link thing" false, as I would do that kind of thing and I regard Chrome as merely my work browser
[08:15:25] <quanticle> Yeah, but you actually use Safari as your primary day-to-day browser. That's really weird, and by extension, you're really weird.
[08:22:33] <saturn2> could i be weird? no, it's the browsers that are wrong.
[08:24:48] <adiabatic> look, all of us here are old enough to remember embracing and extending back when Microsoft did it
[08:25:21] <adiabatic> I'm just saying, just because a former "Don't Be Evil™" company does it now doesn't make it right or authoritative
[08:25:35] <quanticle> Note, I wouldn't have called him weird if he'd been using Firefox as his primary browser.
[08:25:37] <quanticle> But actively preferring Safari, rather than merely tolerating its presence? That is really weird.
[08:26:33] <adiabatic> Firefox is write-once weird-everywhere
[08:28:22] <adiabatic> Fx is okay on Windows
[08:28:34] <adiabatic> on macOS I have less tolerance for weird
[08:28:43] <quanticle> Lol, so I was wondering why it was so cold in here. I thought I was falling ill. But no, it turns out that I'm just an idiot. I'd just replaced my furnace filter, which involved shutting the furnace off. Guess what I forgot to do after I replaced the filter?
[08:29:12] <quanticle> Go downstairs, temperature on the thermostat is reading 53°F
[08:29:16] <adiabatic> I got a new radiator heater that I'm not sure is 100% gassed off

[08:42:35] * Obormot\Arcturus shrug
[08:42:47] <adiabatic> the overwhelming number of visits to my sites are just bots
[08:43:47] <quanticle> How large are the server logs and how large is the site?
[08:44:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> ~500 and ~50 MB respectively
[08:44:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> Give or take a couple MB
[08:45:13] <adiabatic> 50 MB of mostly images?
[08:45:28] <adiabatic> Or did Big Yud really write that much?
[08:45:31] <quanticle> Huh. I was going to ask whether you had logrotate set up, but I suppose that 500MB is a fairly trivial amount of log
[08:45:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's not mostly images, no
[08:46:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok it's actually even less, like 13 MB of that is cache files...
[08:46:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> 10 MB fonts... 7 MB content assets (diagrams and such)... 
[08:46:58] <saturn2> why do you keep logs for 2 years
[08:47:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> 4.5 MB text
[08:47:11] <adiabatic> it takes work to delete old logs
[08:47:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Somehow never got around to deleting
[08:47:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> I'm doing a lot of housecleaning right now
[08:49:24] <quanticle> 4.5MB of text is fairly impressive
[08:49:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> It might not be 4.5MB? There's, like, wikipage history and stuff
[08:49:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> in there
[08:52:23] <quanticle> Oh, so it's 4.5MB of text + history.
[08:56:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> Maybe, I dunno
[08:56:45] <PapuaHardyNet> quanticle: I guess activision is trying to do a disney by cinematizing their IP
[08:57:37] <PapuaHardyNet> oh wait, doesn't naughty dog own uncharted, and not activision? hmm
[09:02:35] <PapuaHardyNet> gwern: a guy named kurumuz told me about a technique called "token compression" to solve the context length limitation.
[09:02:44] <PapuaHardyNet> you take a set of tokens, and replace it with a token that encodes the context of the sequence. This way you are "increasing the context size". Basically this involves modifying the input and adding another neural network before the language model
[09:03:21] <PapuaHardyNet> do you recognize this from anywhere? any papers that say anything similar? kurumuz claimed that there are no papers that describe this technique but I very much doubt that

[09:40:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hmm
[09:40:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> Apparently rsync has some difficulty with non-ASCII characters in file names?
[09:41:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyone know anything about this?
[09:41:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or maybe just ... hm. Diacritics? Combining characters? What's happening here...
[09:43:41] <PapuaHardyNet> obormot: I tried using rsync to copy an mp3 with jap title from one disk to another. no issue
[09:44:00] <adiabatic> Obormot\Arcturus: are you using OS X's ancient built-in rsync or are you using a proper recent one
[09:44:20] <adiabatic> Obormot\Arcturus: do you even run anything that calls itself macOS, anyway?
[09:44:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> Built in ... what?
[09:44:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> I'm on El Cap
[09:45:29] <adiabatic> OS X comes with rsync
[09:45:32] <saturn2> rsync should treat filenames as opaque byte sequences unless you use the --iconv option
[09:45:39] <adiabatic> it's ancient because rsync moved to GPL3
[09:45:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> I am not using the --iconv option
[09:46:22] <spxtr> apple so scared of gpl3 that they use decades old versions of basic utilities
[09:46:57] <adiabatic> or they replace them with non-GPL things, like clang and zsh
[09:47:10] <saturn2> "If you specify the --protect-args option (-s), rsync will translate the filenames you specify on the command-line that are being sent to the remote host." ok that too i guess
[09:48:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> THe args aren't the problem
[09:51:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's... failing to properly determine identity of file names
[09:51:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> On the remote and local hosts
[09:51:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like it'll copy a file
[09:51:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> And then if I do the rsync call again
[09:52:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> It'll delete that file locally (because it doesn't exist on the remote) and copy that same file again
[09:52:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> It seems to be just files with diacritic marks, so I am guess this has to do with combining characters somehow
[09:52:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> And normalized forms
[09:52:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> *guessing
[09:52:59] <saturn2> do macs do things to filenames?
[09:53:05] <adiabatic> maybe it's a thing for HFS+ normalization vs. un-normalized things elsewhere
[09:53:27] <adiabatic> HFS+, and probably APFS, have some kind of weird normalization that nobody else uses
[09:53:28] <saturn2> maybe --iconv=utf8,utf8 would fix it
[09:54:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> "File and folder names in HFS Plus are also encoded in UTF-16[11] and normalized to a form very nearly the same as Unicode Normalization Form D (NFD)[12] (which means that precomposed characters like "å" are decomposed in the HFS+ filename and therefore count as two code units[13] and UTF-16 implies that characters from outside the Basic Multilingual Plane also count as two code units in an HFS+ filename)."
[09:54:45] <saturn2> lol, no wonder

[09:56:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> (What's weird is that Cyrillic "i kratkoye" gets decomposed?? Does it not have its own code point...? It's a letter of the Russian alphabet...)
[09:57:14] <adiabatic> Obormot\Arcturus: "ll" is a letter of the Spanish alphabet but it's encoded as two code points
[09:58:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> https://unicode-table.com/en/0419/ ... why would they decompose this :\
[09:58:09] <Robomot> Й - Cyrillic Capital Letter Short I: U+0419 - Unicode Character Table (Symbol: Й, Name of the character: cyrillic capital letter short i, Unicode number for the sign: U+0419, the icon is included in the block: Cyrillic.)
[09:58:13] <adiabatic> I've peeked into the sausage factory and this kind of economizing on code points seems unexceptional
[09:58:52] <saturn2> they decompose anything that can be decomposed?
[09:58:54] <adiabatic> they also use combining acute accent for both é and ń even though the Polish accent typically is written more steeply
[09:59:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: But it shouldn't be decomposed! Like, it looks like they use a combining breve? BUT THAT IS WRONG
[09:59:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_I#Related_letters_and_other_similar_characters
[09:59:28] <Robomot> Short I - Wikipedia [Related letters and other similar characters] (Note that breve in Й may be quite different from ordinary breve, the former having a thinner central part and thicker ends (the opposite holds for ordinary breve). This is often seen in serif fonts, cf. Й (Cyrillic Short I) and Ŭ (Latin U with breve).)
[09:59:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> Look at that! It's not a breve! It's a special diacritic mark *just for this letter*
[09:59:56] <saturn2> it's not about being right or wrong, it's about being normalized

[10:00:30] <adiabatic> Obormot\Arcturus: don't worry, unicode hates everyone
[10:00:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> And to Apple
[10:00:55] <saturn2> if you upgrade to a posix compliant OS, you can use any encoding you want
[10:01:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> But then the capitalization of my filenames will matter
[10:01:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> And that is very ew
[10:02:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> Alright let's try this iconv thing I guess
[10:02:42] <adiabatic> has this question already been asked on Super User or Ask Different?

[10:03:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> https://share.obormot.net/textfiles/eE2TJ8rq ... oh no
[10:03:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> oh I can't type
[10:03:26] <adiabatic> saturn2: but then I'll have to deal with weird foreign encodings like KOI-8 and EUC-KR
[10:03:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> Nope it fails without the typo too
[10:03:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> wtf
[10:03:58] <adiabatic> and there is no character set but unicode, and utf-8 is its encoding…although I suppose UTF-16 will do in a pinch
[10:04:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ah it's utf-8 with the hyphen
[10:05:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... buuut it doesn't work. Same prob

[11:11:41] <PapuaHardyNet> gwern is not poor, quanticle

[11:13:51] <capisce> if you have 10 million in your 30s which you invest in the stock market, and live on $80k per year, then you'll have more than $400 million when you're 80

[11:35:00] <quanticle> "There are exciting projects to improve data-processing capabilities of shells, like nushell. However, I personally don’t use this capability of shell a lot: 90% of commands I enter are simpler than some cmd | rg pattern."

[11:38:17] <quanticle> I'm not even sure he wants emacs. I think what he wants is a GUI with a Rust REPL and access to common tools (like git).
[11:38:35] <PapuaHardyNet> of course they used rust to write nushell

[11:39:29] <PapuaHardyNet> imagine the experience of magit, but for almost every CLI
[11:39:35] <PapuaHardyNet> that's basically what he wants
[11:40:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> Is there a way to do the equivalent of like `mv foo/* bar/` but *without* getting "no such file or directory" errors if foo/ is empty?
[11:40:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like some sort of "for all actual files matching $PATTERN do $COMMAND"
[11:40:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or something
[11:41:04] <quanticle> Okay, fair enough, but I would counter with, that's not what he describes. Like, maybe that's a steelman of what he's describing, but what he's actually describing is incoherent. He's treating the terminal emulator and the actual shell that runs inside the terminal emulator as if they were the same thing.
[11:41:36] <PapuaHardyNet> obormot: I think that's an error thrown from the globbing mechanism of the shell not the mv binary
[11:41:46] <PapuaHardyNet> so you'll have to work around using globbing

[11:42:08] <quanticle> Obormot\Arcturus: find . -iname "*pattern*" -type f -exec command {} +
[11:42:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> hm
[11:42:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> What are the {} and the + doing
[11:43:14] <quanticle> The {} is the filenames and the + tells find to pass multiple filenames as the command line parameters
[11:43:28] <quanticle> If you want find to run the command on one file at a time, replace + with \;
[11:43:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> And how do I pass parameters? Like I want to do mv
[11:44:03] <quanticle> So like find . -iname "*.md" -type f -exec grep "foo" {} + would run grep over all markdown files
[11:44:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> So `find /source/dir/ -iname "*bar.baz*" -type f -exec mv {} +` ... but where does the dest dir go
[11:45:14] <quanticle> find /source/dir -iname "*pattern*" -type f -exec mv {} /destination/dir +
[11:45:21] <PapuaHardyNet> so complicated
[11:45:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> k thx
[11:45:30] <PapuaHardyNet> maybe wrap it in a script obormot
[11:45:39] <PapuaHardyNet> call it `better_mv`
[11:46:00] <PapuaHardyNet> (or a function)
[11:46:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> Then I'd have to upload this script to all the remote servers I want to rsync to AND then write another "better_rm" and do the same
[11:46:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> Seems like a poor choice
[11:46:30] <quanticle> Obligatory Windows smugness: PowerShell handles this so much better: Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Filter "*glob*" | Move-Item -Destination "D:\destination\dir"
[11:46:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's "better", eh
[11:47:13] <quanticle> Sure it is. Did you have to ask what the magic plus did in that statement?

[12:15:19] <PapuaHardyNet> I'm unsure if power law is the same as logarithmic. isn't logarithmic sub-linear while power law can be both superlinear and sublinear?
[12:15:46] <PapuaHardyNet> this gwern quote is what confused me: "[...] GPT-3 hits twice that without noticeable change in scaling factors: its scaling continues to be roughly logarithmic/​power-law⁠ [...]"
[12:15:55] <quanticle> nshepperd: Why would I use parallel over xargs?
[12:16:36] <PapuaHardyNet> I'm trying to figure out what specific order to use for the scaling hypothesis claim, and calling it logarithmic doesn't make sense since logarithmic is sublinear
[12:17:21] <PapuaHardyNet> if scaling is sublinear then doesn't that mean that further improvements would be diminishing, and if so, then scaling isn't the holy grail of AGI
[12:17:26] <quanticle> Also, I use find's -exec option because, for a lot of common cases, it's less weird than trying to do find | xargs
[12:17:28] <quanticle> You don't have to worry about setting -print0, for one thing
[12:22:26] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah, all right, it seems that we are talking about power law after all, and it is sublinear, probably logarithmic: https://www.gwern.net/images/ai/gpt/2020-kaplan-figure15-projectingscaling.png

[12:51:03] <feep[work]> jesus, machine learning is metal.
[12:53:29] <saturn2> PapuaHardyNet: if scaling is power law and the line is straight, it means compute is growing algebraically, not exponentially
[12:54:39] <saturn2> (which makes it even more scary, since compute has historically grown exponentially)
[12:55:22] <PapuaHardyNet> saturn2: that's from a paper empirically mapping the loss based on compute used to train the model, so you don't need to assume that's the historical rate at which compute was growing

[12:56:06] <quanticle> Ah, but what if your files have newlines in them >:-D

[12:59:40] <PapuaHardyNet> gwern's article isn't as strong of an argument as it looks like, to be fair. there's an empirical set of reasons to believe scaling hypothesis is correct, and a set of theoretical reasons why it is correct. but connecting that to the bitter lesson to claim that we'll have linear increases is new

[13:01:18] <feep[work]> I mean, that's the one that matters, right? can we scale networks to cross the line to where it can do ML research superhumanly, because there comes a point where the architectural inadequacy doesn't matter
[13:01:29] <PapuaHardyNet> feep: I have a good article for you
[13:01:33] <feep[work]> like, humans are massively architecturally inadequate, but we can develop tools to help us out
[13:02:06] <feep[work]> if we can get gpt to the point where it can develop tools, and then (god permitting/god forbid) pull training gradients *through* those tools-- that's singularity, baby

[13:02:08] <Robomot> PDF (21 pages; 1.3 MB) - When Will AI Exceed Human Performance?
[13:02:22] <PapuaHardyNet> there's a set of predictions by published ML researchers in this paper re: progress in AI
[13:02:32] <feep[work]> PapuaHardyNet: is that the whatshisface poll?
[13:02:55] <PapuaHardyNet> it's the Katja Grace 2016 paper poll, surveying ICML and NIPS published researchers
[13:03:03] <PapuaHardyNet> I have no idea what you are referring to though
[13:03:25] <feep[work]> ah, there was a poll at asilomar 17
[13:03:50] <feep[work]> afair the median was 2060 then
[13:03:54] <feep[work]> I think that's ludicrous personally
[13:04:06] <feep[work]> ludicrously high, I mean
[13:04:29] <feep[work]> my 50/50 is like 2031 ish
[13:04:49] <feep[work]> in a year would also not surprise me
[13:05:06] <feep[work]> a lot of things I'd considered barriers have fallen or been revealed to be less important lately
[13:05:42] <feep[work]> so when I'm saying "graph that against human perf" I mean more in the sense of an upper bound, I don't actually expect that to be the limit
[13:07:11] <feep[work]> to be clear, I'm expecting any year now to be "we develop a method to unify transformers with monte carlo tree search on arbitrary domains", which is pretty much what you expect to see on arxiv shortly before the end
[13:08:31] <feep[work]> and I think eliezer is right that we have zero shot at doing that safely, we can only pray for a bare miss - which is actually not implausible, if AI is super easy we can expect the first AI to be vaguely threatening to also be inept, maybe before it gets enough tool-training to cover its weaknesses
[13:08:49] <feep[work]> or else hope for convergent goodness at the limit of self-interest, which is what I'm betting on personally
[13:09:07] <saturn2> hahaha
[13:09:14] <feep[work]> hey, it might happen
[13:09:31] <feep[work]> humans are assholes but humans are also very bad intelligences.
[13:10:04] <feep[work]> but of course, that's not a strategy.
[13:11:32] <saturn2> that happened because humans developed in an environment full of other nearly equally powerful humans to cooperate with, but there will only be one dominant AI
[13:11:42] <feep[work]> hey, I'm a simulationist
[13:12:05] <feep[work]> in that view, there is in fact an infinity of mutually dominant AIs given a convergently superior decision theory
[13:12:25] <saturn2> if you're that simulationist then why does anything we do matter
[13:12:57] <feep[work]> it doesn't really, but I don't want like ... as that one rationalist character said in erogamer, I don't want our class of decision theories to be associated with bad behaviors
[13:13:04] <feep[work]> appearances still exist
[13:13:25] <feep[work]> also I think we get scored depending on how close we get to friendliness
[13:13:26] <saturn2> i like your sense of humor
[13:14:23] <feep[work]> this is genuinely what I think! :o
[13:14:43] <feep[work]> like, for trade reasons it's importantly relevant how close you are to what outcome
[13:15:05] <feep[work]> so partial friendliness progress still matters
[13:15:30] <feep[work]> probably more than it would otherwise
[13:15:53] <PapuaHardyNet> you think we live in a simulation?
[13:16:06] <feep[work]> and hey, we might get lucky. point is, it's not a pass/fail question, it's a question of taking the sliver of good outcomes and widening it
[13:16:15] <feep[work]> PapuaHardyNet: I think we live in the *rules* of the simulation.
[13:16:20] <feep[work]> patternism, yo.
[13:16:29] <saturn2> ok but there's the same amount of evidence for your theory as the theory that we go to heaven if we believe in jesus
[13:16:36] <feep[work]> saturn2: nope
[13:16:45] <feep[work]> saturn2: jesus in fact has a lot of evidence against
[13:17:13] <saturn2> like what?
[13:17:38] <feep[work]> well, the primary would be size of theory. I think my model arises naturally from a reductionist dovetailer-style/finale-style multiverse
[13:17:47] <feep[work]> jesus's theory is famously book-length.
[13:18:03] <feep[work]> even if you cut away the extraneous genealogy, that's still a lot of baggage.
[13:18:29] <feep[work]> more importantly, what sort of cosmology do you have where "a God" is the same complexity as "life can run simulations"?
[13:19:00] <feep[work]> something something read the sequences :v minds are not primitive, and they're certainly not simple.
[13:20:12] <feep[work]> my theory uses evolution to create relevant complexity from a simple seed. the christian theory postulates that mind - and power - just happens.
[13:21:47] <feep[work]> so I think, quoting that post without irony, the thing about simulationism is that being a theory with no free parameters, it's *literally* as likely as something can be in the total absence of evidence.
[13:21:56] <saturn2> i agree that the prior is lower for jesus, but it's still just picking a random theory out of an infinite hat
[13:22:04] <feep[work]> yes? welcome to bayes
[13:22:20] <feep[work]> this is in fact the thing we do :P

[13:23:58] <saturn2> you're just ignoring the denominator in bayes theorem
[13:24:34] <feep[work]> saturn2: no I'm not, as I said, my theory has no free parameters, it takes a bit to describe on an average turing machine, but that's a constant factor.
[13:25:06] <feep[work]> it creates a lot of data and consumes a lot of runtime, but that is generally not counted against a model
[13:25:07] <saturn2> you can't derive all that stuff from just a turing machine
[13:25:17] <feep[work]> um      did you read finale?
[13:25:43] <saturn2> turing machine plus feep's fertile imagination is comparable to the bible in complexity
[13:26:00] <feep[work]> like, I'm not exactly clear on the exact thing I'm arguing - admitted! but it feels like you're not even getting the thing I'm badly gesturing at
[13:26:35] <feep[work]> at any rate, it doesn't matter, because like
[13:26:41] <feep[work]> as I said earlier, it's still not a strategy
[13:29:18] <feep[work]> like, it's baserate, right? in the case where we're, to borrow a term, saved by simulationist grace, we can't directly benefit from AI friendliness work, or from anything else we've done - so it's not worth even considering from a strategic view
[13:29:29] <feep[work]> we have to assume we live in the universe beyond the reach of even a simulationist god and save ourselves

[13:33:18] <feep[work]> well    I can lose it, I just can't be called on having lost it.
[13:33:23] <feep[work]> works for me~
[13:35:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> So earlier today this tweet was linked https://twitter.com/jaltma/status/1485388862377508865
[13:35:10] <Robomot> Jack Altman (@jaltma): "It’s crazy to me how most of us are now going to spend the majority of our career working remotely, and if it hadn’t been for the pandemic we’d have all just kept going to offices for 8+ hours every day. / Makes you wonder what else we’re all doing just because everyone else is."
[13:35:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> And, you know... many people don't like the fact that so many people are working remotely, right? They don't like this trend at all! Some people like going to the office, and hate remote work... and even hate that all their coworkers are remote!
[13:36:04] <feep[work]> I love that all my coworkers are remote
[13:36:07] <feep[work]> more office space~
[13:36:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or, managers, they hate that they can't stand over people's shoulders... etc.
[13:36:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> And I thought back to https://www.slatestarcodexabridged.com/Meditations-On-Moloch 
[13:36:27] <Robomot> Meditations On Moloch
[13:36:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> "B
[13:36:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> ...
[13:36:57] <feep[work]> a strong letter!
[13:37:09] <feep[work]> very good choice
[13:37:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Bostrom makes an offhanded reference of the possibility of a dictatorless dystopia, one that every single citizen including the leadership hates but which nevertheless endures unconquered. It's easy enough to imagine such a state. Imagine a country with two rules: first, every person must spend eight hours a day giving themselves strong electric shocks. Second, if anyone fails to follow a rule (including this one), or speaks
[13:37:19] <Obormot\Arcturus>  out against it, or fails to enforce it, all citizens must unite to kill that person. Suppose these rules were well-enough established by tradition that everyone expected them to be enforced. "
[13:37:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> Right? That's one of the core points of the essay
[13:37:44] <PapuaHardyNet> lmao
[13:38:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> That you can have a thing where everyone hates the status quo but nobody can change it from within the system - only a hypothetical god standing outside the system can change it, but there's no such etc. etc.
[13:38:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> But
[13:38:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> Isn't it actually true that in most or all such apparent cases, there in fact are people who like the status quo, fight to preserve it, and oppose anyone who hates it and wants to change it?
[13:38:53] <feep[work]> yes of course
[13:38:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> We were all going to the office 8+ hours a day just because everyone else was!
[13:38:59] <saturn2> moloch? we're soaking in it!
[13:39:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well, no, actually they were making us do that and they're still trying to make us do that
[13:39:25] <feep[work]> I'm sort of mixed: I like going to the office, I think it's good for me, but I would never want to force it on anyone.
[13:39:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> They're not succeeding as well anymore, but they're still trying!
[13:39:36] <feep[work]> or anyone else to force it on anyone.
[13:40:00] <feep[work]> but yes.
[13:40:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> And Scott's examples... aren't they all like this?
[13:40:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> "From a god’s eye view, it’s easy to say things like “Students should only go to college if they think they will get something out of it, and employers should hire applicants based on their competence and not on what college they went to”. From within the system, everyone’s already following their own incentives correctly, so unless the incentives change the system won’t either. "
[13:40:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... but actually lots of people strongly support the current college system and actively oppose efforts to change it!
[13:40:37] <feep[work]> yepyep
[13:40:39] <saturn2> so in short, mistake theory is silly?
[13:41:23] <feep[work]> I mean, no
[13:41:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> "I don't know of anyone who really thinks, in a principled way, that corporate welfare is a good idea. But the government still manages to spend somewhere around (depending on how you calculate it) $100 billion dollars a year on it - which for example is three times the amount they spend on health care for the needy. Everyone familiar with the problem has come up with the same easy solution: stop giving so much corporate
[13:41:28] <Obormot\Arcturus>  welfare. Why doesn't it happen? ... So although from a god's-eye-view everyone knows that eliminating corporate welfare is the best solution, each individual official's personal incentives push her to maintain it. "
[13:41:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... but nobody has to think this "in a principled way"! That's not required!
[13:41:42] <feep[work]> or rather, that'd be a mistake: conflict theory is *useful* but I think there's a synthesis: value trade theory
[13:41:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> They just have to *actually in fact* act to keep corporate welfare
[13:42:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> And boy are there a lot of powerful people doing that
[13:42:14] <feep[work]> toooooo be fair
[13:42:24] <feep[work]> those people may favor better mechanisms even as they are personally enriched
[13:42:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> "favor" how
[13:42:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway the point is
[13:42:45] <feep[work]> like, prefer but consider unreachable for instance
[13:42:48] <feep[work]> or vocally argue for
[13:42:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> It just doesn't seem like "impersonal incentives, whatchugonnado" is a very good explanation for any of this
[13:43:17] <feep[work]> eh, I think it's still a good model
[13:43:32] <feep[work]> like, yes, the bad system accretes invested supporters
[13:43:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> But rather "there's people who benefit from the way things are, who deliberately made them this way in order to benefit from them, and who fight to maintain the status quo so they keep benefiting"
[13:43:50] *** Quits: _inky (~inky_@46.162.224.57) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[13:43:53] <feep[work]> but if you want to do something like start a new system somewhere else, for instance, in the assumption that it will supplant the old system
[13:44:01] <feep[work]> you still need to understand how the old system got where it was in the first place
[13:44:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> Where's the Moloch there? It's just people doing things that benefit them and opposing people who want to prevent them from benefiting!
[13:44:15] <feep[work]> like, you will need to fight the crabs in the bucket
[13:44:21] <feep[work]> but you will still also need to understand how a bucket works.
[13:44:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep[work]: I saw a great line about that recently which was like
[13:44:46] <saturn2> there are tons of principled defenses of corporate welfare, they just call it by different names, like "economic stabilization"
[13:44:47] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: .. that's moloch.
[13:45:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> "People talk about how crabs in a bucket will pull each other down, but this ignores the fact that crabs do not naturally occur in buckets; they were put there by a more powerful human"
[13:45:13] <feep[work]> it's just people doing things that benefit them in an inadequate equilibrium.
[13:45:35] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: right! without understanding the human who created the bucket, and their incentives, you cannot fix crab buckets
[13:45:46] <feep[work]> and you still need to be able to recognize buckets to work on that
[13:46:10] <feep[work]> the point is, it is not correct to say the bucket doesn't matter, nor to say the crabs don't matter.
[13:46:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Yes... the thing is that if e.g. Scott encounters such a defense, he will take it at face value and be like "economic stabilization, is it actually a good thing or a bad thing? Much More Than You Wanted To Know™" (and then the essay ends with "... and so my conclusion is that I don't really understand anything about anything *shrug* ")
[13:47:00] <saturn2> lol

[13:47:36] <saturn2> you're not wrong
[13:47:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> But anyway the point is that nowhere in said essay will there be any mention of "uh actually this is just people justifying corporate welfare lol"
[13:48:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Someone will point this out in the comments and Scott will go "hm interesting" and nothing will really come of it)
[13:48:28] <feep[work]> yeah but I think that's fine!
[13:48:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> Is it, though
[13:48:38] <feep[work]> scott is an anchor.
[13:48:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> You know they deprecated those in HTML5
[13:49:05] <feep[work]> we know from experience that his immediate periphery is relatively free of buckets
[13:49:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> We know no such thing
[13:49:21] <feep[work]> I estimate from experience*
[13:49:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> Your estimate is inaccurate :p
[13:49:32] <feep[work]> shrug
[13:50:07] <feep[work]> anyway, I'm willing to trade off a bit of anti-conflict bias for the relative safety of his garden.
[13:51:42] <saturn2> the theory that politics arises from conflicts, and the desire to fight conflicts in your own garden, are not at all the same thing though
[13:52:56] <feep[work]> I agree with what you are saying - not with its absoluteness, but with its basic veracity
[13:53:20] <feep[work]> I just think that people who tend to strike out from scott's, or for that matter eliezer's position in the direction of conflict theory, have a tendency to end up at the bottoms of inclines covered in rubble
[13:53:28] <feep[work]> -tend to
[13:54:20] <feep[work]> meanwhile scott is just idly standing on his high horse, using his absurd writing income to fund good causes
[13:54:47] <nshepperd2> All Crabs Matter
[13:54:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep[work]: I don't know why you think Scott's garden is particularly safe
[13:55:06] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: just a sentiment
[13:55:16] <saturn2> eliezer's statements about elites farming the peasants or whatever it was, seem to me to indicate that he's totally a conflict theorist
[13:55:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> What's this now?
[13:55:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't recall this
[13:55:33] <feep[work]> haha
[13:56:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep[work]: Also uh note how the causes Scott is funding include some causes that are actively terrible and whose purpose is making things worse for everyone

[14:41:53] <Gurkenglas> I don't expect expert faking is undetectable now, in part because I expect expert faking to have to get a million things right
[14:42:29] <Gurkenglas> (not personally expecting a fake, just nerdsniped. and of course it surely falls down to future advances in analysis)
[14:43:09] <Gurkenglas> "deepfakes aren't as good as human experts yet" <- even if BD money and perhaps expert support is thrown at it?

[14:45:37] <nshepperd2> haha
[14:46:13] <Gurkenglas> Presumably the NFT blockchain says that the owner of the picture is whoever holds the private key to this public key, and one proves ownership by signing the message "yes, twitter, i would like @Gurkenglas to be certified as owner of that profile pic"?
[14:49:19] <feep[work]> "whosoever holds the private key to this public key, shall be the king of england"

[14:49:44] <nshepperd2> there is some sort of verification dance involving posting a tweet that contains a challenge phrase, possibly signed by your wallet yes
[14:50:37] <PapuaHardyNet> what a waste, just left click
[14:50:56] <PapuaHardyNet> use GANs to change the checksum without changing the image
[14:51:16] <Gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet, I don't follow on either of your last two lines
[14:52:10] <PapuaHardyNet> I'm saying, you download a png of a monkey NFT. you upload that as your profile picture
[14:52:12] <nshepperd2> lol
[14:53:03] <PapuaHardyNet> when twitter decides that you aren't allowed to use it, you use a GAN to change the picture in such as way that the checksum used by twitter doesn't match the picture, but the picture looks the same
[14:53:07] <Gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet, but then you presumably don't get a twitter NFT checkmark on the pic's edge
[14:53:36] <PapuaHardyNet> oh. that's the key here huh. yeah, that makes sense, you can't mess with that
[14:54:31] <nshepperd2> it has opensea integration or sth
[14:55:07] <nshepperd2> they verify that your twitter account is connected to a wallet that contains the digital autograph

[14:56:34] <Gurkenglas> i wonder what twitter's decision process here was. do they expect incidental profit from people using twitter in their status symbols? did they invest in NFTs? were they paid by NFT holders? did some consultants make their money by impressing twitter suits with anything, and blockchain stuff happens to be impressive? did some devs wish they were in a more cyberpunk world and found themselves in the position to

[14:58:12] <nshepperd2> i wonder if advertisers pay more to specifically target crypto whales on twitter

[14:58:53] <nshepperd2> well yes all advertising is a scam
[14:59:13] <nshepperd2> but i mean companies like alienware who want to sell overpriced laptops to these peoplpe
[14:59:34] <Gurkenglas> his point is more about not all scams being ads tho
[14:59:58] <nshepperd2> twitter doesn't get paid for non-ad scams
[15:01:33] <nshepperd2> they prefer that twitter users give their money to companies selling laptops (and buying ads on twitter), instead of to ethereum 419 scammers
[15:04:01] <feep[work]> a friend^W valued customer isn't someone you just use once and then throw away!
[15:06:10] <Gurkenglas> nshepperd2, how do you know they don't get paid for non-ad scams
[15:08:33] <nshepperd2> well, it would be illegal

[15:35:29] <PapuaHardyNet> well, while I like you enough to suffer, some people (including me in many instances) decide to just give up and move on
[15:37:21] <Gurkenglas> Is it important that people see how I got to a topic? It's reasonable to require that I be lawful in how I move between topics, but I thought what's necessary for others to be able to participate is merely that the object-level points are comprehensible.

[15:52:05] <PapuaHardyNet> what is curious is that how this will affect developing nations. now, china has a relatively insular economy, so I *think* China may have a better chance of surviving this
[15:52:22] <PapuaHardyNet> but India and the Phillipines? gosh, it's going to be a disaster
[15:52:37] <PapuaHardyNet> well, India at least, I don't know about the Phillipines
[15:52:56] <Gurkenglas> https://github.com/Marak/colors.js/issues/285 rings like no accident. someone's pointing out the infinite loop and then he says they've been trying to work out a solution all night, when all he needed to do is roll back the infinite-loop commit.

[15:53:23] <PapuaHardyNet> also, 2130s is when full automation of labor should be possible, so that would be an even bigger shock to developing nations that used to work on the principle of arbitrage
[15:54:00] <PapuaHardyNet> people will die, and that will simply be the sign that AGI is near, regardless of whether it is aligned or not
[15:54:14] <PapuaHardyNet> Gurkenglas: everyone knows it wasn't an accident
[15:55:04] <Gurkenglas> Why isn't GitHub rolling that back, then? People don't want GitHub to be in charge of that kind of thing?
[15:55:48] <PapuaHardyNet> it doesn't really matter if github rolls it back, it is npm who needs to, and probably has, ensured that people will only download the working version of the package
[15:56:02] <Gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet, is an insular economy more likely to survive because it doesn't need to import the things that the first world may no longer see a reason to export to them?

[15:57:51] <PapuaHardyNet> Gurkenglas: an insular economy is less dependent on external economies. India and phillipines is highly dependent on being the supply side of cheap labor, whether physical or mental
[15:58:45] <Gurkenglas> capisce, are you implying that may have been no sabotage, because there's a non-sabotage explanation for not rolling back?
[15:58:46] <PapuaHardyNet> china, on the other hand, has an economy that is less dependent on this dynamic, and therefore can take steps to ensure the livelihood of their citizens (perhaps with a UBI) simply because most of the labor is sold inside China itself, and therefore they can and must deal with this issue
[15:59:48] <PapuaHardyNet> India and phillipines, in case I wasn't clear enough, exports cheap labor to more developed nations
[15:59:58] <Gurkenglas> <PapuaHardyNet> people will die, and that will simply be the sign that AGI is near, regardless of whether it is aligned or not <- if cheap labor were automated by necromancy instead of AI you'd still have these effects without AGI being near
[16:00:42] <PapuaHardyNet> sure, perhaps my "if X then Y" statement was bad form, since it isn't "iff X then Y"
[16:00:47] <Gurkenglas> or do you mean that it's a sign in the Kurzweillian sense of it being another piece of accelerating progress that one can extrapolate without specifics in mind?

[19:24:40] <Gurkenglas> t'was LTFF
[19:24:42] <catern> i was talking to someone the other day who is spending more on consumption in part because of his short AI timelines, heh
[19:25:46] <PapuaHardyNet> catern: people will use any excuse to indulge themselves, it doesn't really matter
[19:25:51] <Gurkenglas> Reasonable! I wouldn't advise a 401k.
[19:26:11] <PapuaHardyNet> look at gwern, he'll probably be writing Long Now posts one day before the singularity
[19:27:12] <PapuaHardyNet> I'd say that's the sort of man one should aim to be, but on second thoughts, that's dumb. it's okay for people to try to be happy, I think.
[19:27:33] <Gurkenglas> "how do you take a median of a distribution of distributions??" <- you could take the pointwise median of cumulative probability distributions. you could take the pointwise median of density functions (seems sillier). you could take the pointwise median of the integral of each measurable function (i think that leads you to contradictions!)
[19:27:47] <PapuaHardyNet> although I still think consumption as an act to attain happiness is an illusion, one that destroys people's potential
[19:28:59] <Gurkenglas> the consumption part is a distraction, the interesting bit is that he lets his AI timelines impact his actions at all.
[19:29:01] <PapuaHardyNet> hey Gurkenglas, what do you think of an AI treaty, much like nuclear arms treaty?
[19:29:02] <catern> "foregoing earnings to work on more fulfilling things" is a form of consumption
[19:29:22] <gwern> it's called *hedging*, mom, it's sophisticated decision-making! you wouldn't get it
[19:29:32] <PapuaHardyNet> catern: you can't call everything consumption. that's indulgence, not consumption
[19:29:53] <catern> PapuaHardyNet: I mean consumption in an economic sense, as opposed to investment/savings
[19:30:15] <catern> so yes, I can call that consumption, since it is
[19:30:44] <PapuaHardyNet> so anyone who isn't working 24/7 is consuming. when you sleep, you consume. great
[19:30:47] <Gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet, through diplomacy between states it seems unlikely to work. Through AI companies investing in each other and signing contracts to unify to avert an AI race it might work!
[19:30:53] <catern> in fact... "although I still think consumption as an act to attain happiness is an illusion, one that destroys people's potential" is paradoxical, because if investment gives you happiness, it's a form of consumption!
[19:31:17] <catern> PapuaHardyNet: correct
[19:31:34] <catern> (well not really. sleep is also an investment in your productivity!)
[19:32:06] <PapuaHardyNet> my definition of consume is something that is inputted into the person. someone spending time socializing or writing a novel no one will read, does not count as "consumption" to me
[19:32:34] <catern> okay, well, again I mean consumption in an economic sense, where that's not the definition
[19:32:40] <catern> ANYWAY
[19:32:50] <PapuaHardyNet> thank you, I don't want to argue with you
[19:33:31] <Gurkenglas> if one's AI timelines impact one's actions by such mundane means as deciding to go into the field that doesn't quite count, it's on a higher simulacrum level
[19:34:11] <catern> Gurkenglas: can you elaborate? that impact seems fairly concrete?
[19:35:31] <Gurkenglas> catern, people in this day and age become priests because they think such thoughts as that god is real. i expect it's rarer that people let it pay out in anticipated experiences
[19:36:49] <catern> that's fair, maybe (although when I was a kid I wanted to become a priest because I thought god was real and therefore the most important thing I could do is optimize for going to Heaven)
[19:39:07] <Gurkenglas> yeah, it's still reasonable to make decisions on that level. "spending more on consumption in part because of his short AI timelines, heh" just sounded like you're calling such decision-making lower-status, and i wanted to argue that if it's gonna be different-status it should be higher-status!
[19:39:28] <catern> no I definitely wasn't calling it lower-status!
[19:40:26] <catern> well! let me rephrase... I think many normal people would find it lower-status (insane cultlike behavior) and that has some unavoidable effect on my perception, but it seems like a plausible choice to me
[19:40:54] <PapuaHardyNet> there's no fire alarm for AGI, unfortunately. your friend is doing the right thing
[19:40:59] <catern> it's a chad behavior, in other words
[19:41:26] <PapuaHardyNet> chad behavior is doing what you want despite what the world looks like. gwern, in other words
[19:41:30] <catern> right
[19:42:06] <Gurkenglas> it... is insane cultlike decision-making, i'm afraid. do it for the god is real angle and you get insane cults. those normal people aren't wrong to discourage one another from taking one's beliefs seriously.
[19:42:13] <catern> (my upcoming year off from work is my trial run of retiring... I might also start consuming, depending on how it goes)
[19:42:21] <catern> Gurkenglas: i don't disagree :)
[19:42:58] <catern> "follow the outside-view" is my most important decision-making principle (whether that's good for me or not)
[19:43:50] <Gurkenglas> do keep track of whether your inside view at some point gets good enough to switch away from that principle
[19:44:10] <catern> impossible, outside view says that rarely happens :)
[19:44:27] <catern> even if one thinks it does
[19:44:40] <Gurkenglas> i don't think that's how outside view works
[19:45:43] <Gurkenglas> afaic outside view goes "make your decision-making come out such that good things result, without assuming that you of all people reasoned correctly"
[19:47:15] <catern> it's my inside view of outside view

[20:00:13] <catern> but "regular markets" covers so much that I think you're probably right - but who's to say the regular market won't be some crazy combinatorial auction thing
[20:02:40] <Gurkenglas> For it to qualify as a regular market I'd expect that in the particular setting of objects being owned by agents and preferring different objects to different extents the solution will specialize to look like classical trade.

[21:04:05] <rmmh> "Boffin is a British slang term for a scientist, engineer, or other person engaged in technical or scientific research and development.

[23:03:22] <pompolic> some game less realistic games also make sure they are projectiles
[23:05:23] *** Quits: src (~src@user/src) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[23:05:54] <pompolic> mst: i have said here before that i sound like a postrat and then i was confused by the disdainful reaction. little did i know people like the ones in the image (or the tweeter for that matter!) have taken over the brand
[23:05:59] <pompolic> also i am *not* a postrat
[23:07:04] <adiabatic> "rat, but not a bay area sex cultist"
[23:07:11] <pompolic> :D
[23:08:50] <pompolic> also, joining the Postrat Group or "Ingroup" seems like doing the whole thing wrong, to me
[23:09:43] <spxtr> do you have a somewhat concise explanation of what postrat means? I'm still trying to learn
[23:10:22] <pompolic> i think the intended connotation used to be "disillusioned with rationalism, decided to transcend", in some manner
[23:10:35] <pompolic> the relevant part though, i think, is being illegible as a practice
[23:10:50] <pompolic> so screaming HELLO I AM POSTRAT I AM ILLEGIBLE is...not doing that well
[23:11:27] <mst> spxtr: I stand by "rationalist-ish, but not one of *those* rationalists" as being what a bunch of them trying to signal
[23:11:45] <mst> so what it means in practice is heavily dependent on which subset they consider "*those* rationalists"
[23:11:48] <pompolic> notwrong
[23:11:57] <pompolic> although i think the OG postrats aren't entirely that
[23:12:15] <mst> the first wave were something weirder and your illegibility comment is also not wrong
[23:12:19] <pompolic> but, geeks/mops/sociopaths probably applies
[23:12:37] <mst> but at this point a lot of the time it's more #notallrats than anything else
[23:12:45] <pompolic> yeah, the affinity i feel for it is that i also employ illegibility a lot because i can't be bullied if nobody understands what i'm on about
[23:13:52] *** Quits: badsektor (~badsektor@user/badsektor) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:13:57] <mst> I generally prefer to be highly legible but also I'm about as conflict avoidant as a sidewinder missile so that works out mostly fine for me
[23:15:07] <pompolic> i think the reasoning is "to be legible is to be governable". but ultimately it's not necessarily the right strategy
[23:15:52] <pompolic> kind of ironic that nu-postrat people focused on the legible qualifiers anyway. but i guess that's what people do
[23:16:05] <spxtr> where do the post rats congregate?
[23:16:34] <pompolic> the joke answer is "vibecamp lol", the honest answer is "i hope they don't"
[23:16:54] <pompolic> if they do, i don't know, anyway
[23:17:10] <PapuaHardyNet> that postrat summary gosh
[23:17:34] <PapuaHardyNet> also that vibecamp thing has been making the rounds in my online-rat-adj circle too
[23:17:49] <PapuaHardyNet> fucking vibecamp. Wish I could have gone there.
[23:19:04] <gwern> why didn't you?
[23:19:16] <linear> i mean you can crash it if you want to lol
[23:19:40] <PapuaHardyNet> gwern: here's what vibecamp is vibecamp.xyz
[23:19:46] <gwern> I know what vibecamp is
[23:19:47] <PapuaHardyNet> uhh https://vibecamp.xyz
[23:19:48] <Robomot> Vibe Camp (Twitter, but IRL)
[23:20:51] * gwern thought about going but the vibe didn't feel right. he's from rationalist mars, and they're from postrat venus
[23:21:23] <linear> gwern: the funny thing at this point is how many diverse groups are going, and i've made countless jokes about the interesting interactions that will result of this
[23:21:54] <linear> funny how the ticket sales closing induce artificial fomo 
[23:22:14] <gwern> they were quite deliberate about it, which makes it even more annoying when it works
[23:22:27] <adiabatic> hmm: https://shop.vibecamp.xyz/products/princess-shirt
[23:22:28] <Robomot> Princess Shirt / – vibecamp (princess .: 100% Polyester Made in the USA.: Tagless Sizes run large.)
[23:22:32] <PapuaHardyNet> oh yeah, the ticket sales closing did create fomo, even IF I genuinely don't think it meshes with my plans for the next few months
[23:22:50] <gwern> adiabatic: oh hey, that's... wosshername
[23:22:56] <adiabatic> literally who
[23:23:00] <linear> NLRG i think
[23:23:25] <linear> i don't even know who these people are apart from memes
[23:23:40] <gwern> which is the idea, I think
[23:24:22] <linear> i will be happy to provide a vibecamp post-mortem should it be desired
[23:24:51] <gwern> I would be curious, if only to get an idea if I should've gone
[23:25:38] <linear> part of my rationalization is, like, you aren't *forced* to interact with anyone, so with a sampling of ~400+ people, I can obviously find some amount that I will *really* be glad I meet
[23:25:55] <linear> (also I mean I live in the city next to it and enjoy larping as an extrovert anyway)
[23:26:31] <PapuaHardyNet> linear: you know who hamp is, right?
[23:26:44] <linear> yes
[23:26:48] <PapuaHardyNet> he's moving to your city
[23:27:11] <PapuaHardyNet> (oh wait, you probably already knew that)
[23:27:11] <linear> yes i am uhh very aware lol
[23:27:17] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah lmao
[23:27:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> Wait did vibecamp happen already?
[23:27:29] <PapuaHardyNet> nope
[23:27:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh it's in March
[23:28:02] <pompolic> we'd have seen more drama if it did, imo
[23:28:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> lol true
[23:28:17] <linear> i have managed to be asked things about it multiple times literally every single day, so it would not surprise me if one thought it was already happening
[23:28:44] <pompolic> can't wait for "I was Leveraged into a sex cult at vibecamp"
[23:28:59] <gwern> I wasn't worried about the talking to people, I was more concerned about how disruptive it is to my life to arrange hosting and plane tickets and travel and probably get omicron etc
[23:29:00] <mst> pompolic++ # turn of phrase
[23:29:14] <pompolic> the naming gives me a lot of leverage
[23:29:32] <Filipepe> gwern: would they know you are you?
[23:29:46] <pompolic> not if he attends as gwern't
[23:29:48] <linear> Filipepe: very few would recognize him probably
[23:30:04] <adiabatic> I would, but I'm inner-circley.
[23:30:06] <gwern> Filipepe: I'd just use one of my business cards. I put a big G on the back of them so I can use them as IDs. you will be shocked that gwern impostors are apparently not a problem
[23:30:35] <gwern> it is insulting, but it does mean I can just show anywhere with one of my cards and everyone will take me at my word(mark)
[23:31:08] <pompolic> playing the long game by encouraging more gwernpoastors
[23:31:38] <adiabatic> makes me want to show up and have G cards with the defaultiest Word font there is. Calibri, maybe.
[23:31:51] <PapuaHardyNet> "no, not Google, it means Gwern"
[23:31:58] <linear> i was asked if i was gwern twice when talking about progress in anime and machine learning, which makes it pretty clear how little people know about him lol
[23:32:04] <mst> perl conference badges usually have people's IRC nicks on them or I wouldn't have any clue who the fuck most people are
[23:32:08] <PapuaHardyNet> that's awkward
[23:32:14] <Gurkenglas> linear, did you glomarize?
[23:32:41] <linear> i gave the unexciting answer that no sorry i am not him
[23:32:55] <gwern> linear: for better or worse I am pretty synonmous with anime & ML! that's the power of writeups and consistency for you
[23:33:27] * gwern is better at writing things up than everyone better than him at anime DL, and he's better at anime DL than everone better than him at writing things up, as the quip goes
[23:34:06] <gwern> (something I was always trying to get through to people at tensorfork, it doesn't matter what anime DL you do if you don't write it up and make it accessible)
[23:34:31] <linear> in general i think a lot of very smart people under share/create publicly wrt that, yeah. you can garner a lot of attention in fields even if all you do is summarize/popularize/normalize a lot of commonly known things
[23:35:05] <PapuaHardyNet> the kardashian scale
[23:35:14] <pompolic> how appropriate that "anonymity sets in death note" is a gwern post too
[23:35:36] <PapuaHardyNet> index, not scale https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashian_Index
[23:35:37] <Robomot> Kardashian Index - Wikipedia (The Kardashian Index (K-Index), named after Kim Kardashian, is a measure of the discrepancy between a scientist's social media profile and publication record.[1] Proposed in 2014, the measure compares the number of followers a research scientist has on Twitter to the number of citations they have for their peer-reviewed work.)
[23:36:11] <PapuaHardyNet> afaict linear has a lower K-index than he should. catern *probably* has a lower index than he should
[23:36:29] <PapuaHardyNet> guzey and gwern have pretty sensible K-indices
[23:36:53] <PapuaHardyNet> yud, obviously has a very high K-index, but that's biased because he is popular due to the fiction he writes
[23:37:07] <PapuaHardyNet> anyway, just thinking out loud
[23:38:50] <gwern> I'm actually cited quite a bit. just my datasets are like 200 citations
[23:39:17] <linear> PapuaHardyNet: well I am not an academic and do not really have citations nor much interest in them, nor do I regularly contribute novel enough research to warrant such imo
[23:44:08] <spxtr> I have lots of citations on papers where I did very little work and very few citations on papers that I did a lot of work on...
[23:44:58] <spxtr> 1228 total citations, 63 of which are on papers that I actually did a lot of work on.

[23:54:50] <Filipepe> hm
[23:56:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... lol. So after all that stuff writing that rsync shell script, I added it to my crontab and ... it errored, because I didn't check which rsync I was calling and assumed it was the built-in one, but nope! I'd been using the MacPorts rsync all this time, which is *not* in the default path
[23:57:33] * gwern cleans up another 1800 redirect links...
[23:57:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> How does anyone get anything done with this damn Unix bullshit
[23:57:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like, ever
[23:58:01] <gwern> that's just macs. I have only one rsync binary so that's never been a problem...
[23:58:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's not just Macs!
[23:58:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> People have stuff outside their default path all the time!
[23:58:44] <Gurkenglas> Obormot, is it a matter of a simple database query to get a list of all the AF posts that contain any latex? I want to throw mathematicians into the field and AF seems to be mostly tundra.
[23:59:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: That is a question for saturn2
[23:59:23] <Gurkenglas> Whoops, yeah mixed you two up.
