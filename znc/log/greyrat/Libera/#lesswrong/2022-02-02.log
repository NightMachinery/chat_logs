[03:35:21] <rmmh> cervical dislocation is the method of choice for small chicken and rabbit farmers
[03:36:55] <dTal> surely separating the spinal chord gives a horrifying and slow death
[03:37:07] <rmmh> no it's rather fast because that controls the heart
[03:37:38] <dTal> I thought the heart was self-beating and the brain only controls the rate
[03:37:48] <rmmh> it's better than maceration
[03:39:08] <adiabatic> maceration…being eaten?

[03:57:52] <pompolic> this is oppression against my people (the SCPs)
[03:58:31] <nshepperd2> "However, that made SCP-173's situation tenuous. Even though SCP-173 is CC-BY-SA 3.0, its image is not, since it was copyrighted.

[04:46:17] <adiabatic> hm, good point. I'll have to watch for California stops the next time I'm in my buddy's Tesla
[04:46:19] <quanticle> Yeah, at least the Tesla checks to see if anyone else is there before it blows through the stop sign.
[04:46:36] <quanticle> California stops? Over here they're called Michigan stops, lol.
[04:47:10] <ggreer> adiabatic: the only way you can get a rolling stop in a tesla is if you're in the FSD beta program *and* you enable assertive mode
[04:47:25] <adiabatic> one of my high-school teachers — I forget where he's from — wondered if they call them California stops in California
[04:47:38] <saturn2> one nice thing about being human is that no one can prove anything about your behavior without witnessing it (yet, growth mindset)
[04:47:43] <ggreer> there are maybe 50k teslas with FSD beta and most of them don't have assertive mode enabled
[04:48:01] <adiabatic> what else does Assertive Mode do?
[04:48:38] <ggreer> it changes lanes more often, accelerates faster, and generally behaves less like someone taking a driving test
[04:53:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> So. I finished reading _The Shrinking Man_. I guess I understand now what unites these four novels (that one, _The Space Merchants_, _More Than Human_, and _The Long Tomorrow_) such that it makes sense to put them into one anthology.
[04:53:24] <ggreer> also calling it a recall is FUD. when apple fixes a security vuln in their ios, does anyone say they recalled 500 million iphones?
[04:53:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's not that they were published within the same half-decade in the 50s. It's not that they're all novel or groundbreaking.
[04:53:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's that NONE OF THESE AUTHORS CAN WRITE A FUCKING ENDING
[04:54:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> Every single one of these fuckers wrote a pretty great sf novel and then, when it came time to wrap things up, just dropped the goddamn ball
[04:55:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> For example, _The Shrinking Man_. (Uh, spoilers. It's a half-century-old novel but if you care, shield your eyes)
[04:56:23] <quanticle> ggreer: Well, Tesla themselves are calling it a recall, I think. They've done this before; I can't remember offhand but there was another software update that they called a "recall" even though it was pushed out OTA.
[04:56:40] <ggreer> I think NHTSA uses the term recall for software updates
[04:56:41] <saturn2> the man shrinks at the end of _The Shrinking Man_
[04:56:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> Main character keeps shrinking. 1/7th of an inch per day, like clockwork. Obviously, when he shrinks to 0, he's gone. Right? Right. Now, what's established in the middle of the novel is that this shrinking business isn't unexplained alien science magic or w/e, it's an understandable and known thing: he got exposed to [chemicals] and as a result, his body is extracting and discarding nitrogen from his tissues.
[04:57:45] <ggreer> https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-software-881ef270cbfdc6e4f62b88400588686f <-- yeah nhtsa wants tesla to call software updates "recalls"
[04:57:45] <Robomot> US regulators seek answers from Tesla over lack of recall | AP News (DETROIT (AP) — U.S. safety investigators want to know why Tesla didn't file recall documents when it updated Autopilot software to better identify parked emergency vehicles, escalating a simmering clash between the automaker and regulators.)
[04:57:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok, so this is not realistic. Ok, so he should be unable to think or eat or BREATHE long before he gets below an inch. Fine. Let's gloss over that. The point is, it's a naturalistic process that is understood by the people in the fictional world (even if they can't figure how to cure it).
[04:58:04] <quanticle> This was it: https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/11/tesla-recalls-11706-vehicles-over-full-self-driving-beta-software-bug/
[04:58:05] <Robomot> Tesla recalls 11,706 vehicles over Full Self-Driving Beta software bug | Ars Technica (The new software bug caused phantom emergency braking events.)
[04:58:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's a story filled with pathos and tragedy and so on... a story, among other things, of a man coming to terms with his own end, meeting it bravely
[04:58:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> And then, at the end
[04:58:30] <quanticle> It was a "recall" even though it was fixed via an over-the-air software update.
[04:58:44] <ggreer> > The agency says Tesla is aware that federal law requires automakers to do a recall if they find out that vehicles have safety defects.
[04:59:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> He finds that he's shrunk to subatomic size, but he can still breathe and walk around and there's a whole, like, subatomic world to explore, and he's like "wow huh I guess instead of dying, I get to explore an amazing new reality! cool lol"
[04:59:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> THE END
[04:59:40] <kiboneu> ah that's awesome
[04:59:41] <quanticle> "Perhaps the most unusual aspect of this story is that Tesla initiated the recall process through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for a software issue. Almost all the affected cars have already been patched, and Tesla doesn't often feel the need for such formality."
[04:59:51] <quanticle> That was for the previous one.
[05:02:15] <saturn2> Obormot\Arcturus: does he keep shrinking into smaller and smaller worlds-within-worlds for the rest of his natural life?
[05:03:48] <quanticle> Also, I would like to file a formal petition to ban Tesla owners from referring to their Model 3s as M3s.
[05:03:53] <quanticle> Sorry, you're not driving a BMW
[05:03:57] <quanticle> Much less the best BMW
[05:05:52] <ggreer> sadly that ship has sailed

[05:06:37] <Robomot> Tesla to recall vehicles that may disobey stop signs | Hacker News
[05:06:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Who knows! It obviously makes no sense when you think about it for more than two seconds. Like: how does his body excrete nitrogen when a nitrogen atom is the size of his head? etc., etc.
[05:07:33] <quanticle> ggreer: Oh boy, I can't wait to read the opinions of people who did 5 minutes of Googling and now consider themselves experts in both self-driving and safety critical software.
[05:07:34] <ggreer> there's no way to make a compelling self-driving car that also obeys all traffic laws. everyone speeds. everyone rolls at stop signs when nobody else is around
[05:07:46] * quanticle looks around
[05:07:50] <quanticle> Er... I... don't
[05:07:57] <quanticle> Roll through stop signs, that is.
[05:08:10] <quanticle> I guess this makes me uncool, huh?
[05:08:25] <ggreer> you wait for the car to come to a complete stop when literally nobody else is at the intersection? most people get it down to 1-2mph
[05:08:33] <quanticle> Yeah
[05:09:13] <saturn2> Obormot\Arcturus: obviously the nitrogen atoms have smaller nitrogen atoms inside which themselves are excreting even smaller nitrogen atoms, etc etc
[05:09:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> lol
[05:09:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> ggreer: I bring the car to a complete stop at stop signs
[05:09:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> That is the law, and doing otherwise is unsafe
[05:10:16] <saturn2> breaking the law is wrong
[05:10:57] <ggreer> haha, I'm sure everyone who is saying that today is also in favor of locking up anyone who has ever smoked weed (since it's still a federal crime)
[05:11:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> ggreer: THat's right, it's a federal crime, while the driving laws are state and local laws, which are obviously way more important, morally and practically
[05:12:08] <nshepperd2> why would you be sure of something totally wrong
[05:12:13] <ggreer> and I'm sure you never exceed the speed limit
[05:12:15] <nshepperd2> that seems pretty foolish
[05:12:42] <ggreer> 70% of drivers fail to fully stop at stop signs
[05:12:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> ggreer: One does not get a ticket for exceeding the speed limit except in certain areas/situations, THEREFORE it is not illegal in the rest of all cases
[05:12:53] <ggreer> it's normal
[05:13:11] <ggreer> you don't get a ticket for a rolling stop either. who would do that with a cop around?
[05:13:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> What does the presence of a cop have to do with it? It's not like the thing I said about speeding stops being true when there's cops around
[05:13:51] <nshepperd2> 70% of people do lots of dumb things
[05:14:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> Also
[05:14:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> Unrelatedly
[05:14:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> Let me note that over half of the authors in this sf anthology were from New York
[05:14:43] <ggreer> the only reason I come to a full stop at a stop sign (when nobody else is around) is if I want to get the most violent acceleration possible when launching
[05:14:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> And like a third went to Brooklyn Tech specifically, hah
[05:15:12] <quanticle> Obormot\Arcturus: And compared to them, what have you been doing, eh?
[05:15:28] <saturn2> we all deserve to be in prison forever
[05:15:59] <ggreer> I think rolling stops are a good thing. they save a little wear & tear on your car. they save a little gas (and reduce pollution). they save some time. it's silly that they're technically illegal
[05:16:12] <ggreer> although >99.9% of rolling stops go unpunished

[10:01:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> This business with Maus (in case anyone has somehow missed it: a graphic novel about the Holocaust, only graphic novel to ever win the Pulitzer Prize, last month was removed from the 8th grade curriculum of a school board somewhere in Bumfuck, Tennessee) ...
[10:01:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> Here's what I wonder
[10:02:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> 1. How many people handwringing about how this constitutes "banning books" and is therefore directly Nazi-ism, have ever read, watched, or heard any first-person account of the Holocaust prior to this, *including Maus itself*
[10:02:06] <quanticle> I stand with the school board. Maus is *vicious* anti-cat propaganda
[10:02:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> 2. How many of such people are *going to* do the above now
[10:03:08] <quanticle> 3. Do they realize the irony of supporting a book that literally compares Jews to vermin

[10:03:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> No, I was gonna say
[10:03:59] <quanticle> feep[work] joined at the perfect time
[10:04:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> 3. How many of such people can name a single *other* account of the Holocaust, whether fictional, semi-, or non- (extra bonus if they can name something other than "Schindler's List" here)
[10:04:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> Of course the actual decision to "ban" (lol) the thing was overwhelmingly idiotic
[10:04:57] <quanticle> I mean, I can, but I'm not those people
[10:05:09] <feep[work]> hehe
[10:05:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> In completely stereotypical pearl-clutching-Southerner fashion, they apparently removed it because... some of the characters say the word "damn" a couple of times? And there's a nude woman at one point??
[10:05:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> Just the dumbest shit
[10:05:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> But
[10:06:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> For one thing, nobody has "banned" anything!
[10:06:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> Plenty of schools around the country *somehow* manage to get through a whole 8th grade without ever reading Maus
[10:07:01] <quanticle> Yeah. Taking away Maus is beyond the pale but not even having it in the first place is somehow just fine.
[10:07:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's not like anyone's stopping these schoolkids from going out and reading the damn thing if they want to, right??
[10:07:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> Just walk right on down to a public library
[10:07:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or
[10:07:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> The fucking INTERNET
[10:07:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> And read it all you want
[10:07:36] <feep[work]> quanticle: I unironically believe this though.
[10:07:52] <feep[work]> anyway, ineptitude is not an excuse for malice
[10:07:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> The dirty truth, however, is that *of course* nobody's gonna do that and *of course* everyone who's doing the handwringing right now know that perfectly well.
[10:08:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> None of these kids have the slightest interest in reading this comic if their teachers don't force them to.
[10:08:19] <feep[work]> eh, school internet filters, library internet filters..
[10:08:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> Even if they're completely free to do so.
[10:08:27] <feep[work]> right now we're coincidentally in a plurality of options
[10:08:34] <PapuaHardyNet> I mean, it is good publicity for Maus
[10:08:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> It is
[10:08:39] <PapuaHardyNet> so don't worry about it
[10:08:46] <feep[work]> do worry about it tho
[10:08:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> But you see, this is the problem: that the kids won't read it if they're not forced to
[10:09:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> That they have no interest in the topic and everyone damn well knows it
[10:09:53] <PapuaHardyNet> I see. I get what you mean. Even if only a minority reads it, it isn't enough if we want to "raise the sanity waterline"
[10:10:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> They can pearl-clutch and virtue signal all they want, but they know that unless you FORCE schoolkids in fucking *Tennessee* to learn about the Holocaust, they will not, no matter how free they are to do so
[10:10:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> And like half those kids are gonna go home and post on their tumblr and their twitters about how important it is to punch Nazis and they *still* won't bother to learn the actual history unless made to.
[10:10:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> And everyone knows it.

[10:11:49] <quanticle> "But they have to be forced to learn it" isn't really an indictment of the thing
[10:11:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah, but nobody makes shoe-tying a national referendum on how important it is not to "ban" shoelaces...
[10:12:13] <feep[work]> I mean yeah because it's actually not similar at all :p
[10:12:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> Correct, it's a bad analogy, which is my point :p
[10:12:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> Then you have this sort of take:
[10:13:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> "The so-called Streisand Effect – whereby the moment you try to suppress something you promote it more effectively than any ad campaign ever could – has done its thing most wondrously. The decision of a school board in McMinn County (pop 53,794) has been heard around the world; and the type of person who reflexively abhors what they see as ignorant hicks trying to censor Great Art has reacted exactly as you would expect."[
[10:13:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> 151]
[10:13:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> —Sam Leith, literary editor of The Spectator
[10:13:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> So the problem is what? That we're whitewashing history? Or... that we're daring to raise a finger against Great Art?
[10:13:38] <feep[work]> something something the important thing is that you found a way
[10:13:43] <feep[work]> no, that we're predictable apparently
[10:16:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> What's just fascinating, by the way, is that the school board is standing firm
[10:16:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> "One of the most important roles of an elected board of education is to reflect the values of the community it serves. The McMinn County Board of Education voted to remove the graphic novel Maus from McMinn County Schools because of its unnecessary use of profanity and nudity and its depiction of violence and suicide. Taken as a whole, the Board felt this work was simply too adult-oriented for use in our schools.
[10:16:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> We do not diminish the value of Maus as an impactful and meaningful piece of literature, nor do we dispute the importance of teaching our children the historical and moral lessons and realities of the Holocaust. To the contrary, we have asked our administrators to find other works that accomplish the same educational goals in a more age-appropriate fashion. The atrocities of the Holocaust were shameful beyond description, and
[10:16:31] <Obormot\Arcturus>  we all have an obligation to ensure that younger generations learn of its horrors to ensure that such an event is never repeated.
[10:16:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> We simply do not believe that this work is an appropriate text for our students to study.[136]"
[10:17:04] <feep[work]> like
[10:17:11] <feep[work]> they're not *wrong*, but this is interesting in that
[10:17:18] <feep[work]> they're not wrong, they're dissenting
[10:17:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> One wonders what they will possibly come up with! The diary of Anne Frank (where she discusses sexuality in a far more explicit way than 'on page water, a mouse in a comic isn't wearing pants')?
[10:17:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> Schindler's List??
[10:18:26] <feep[work]> I mean yes, on the one hand "we must protect our children from violence and suicide while teaching genocide" is      a take, it's a take
[10:18:44] <feep[work]> almost more consistent to not teach the holocaust at all
[10:19:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Right; it's almost too obvious to say, but it's certainly something to say "we must be strictly age-appropriate in teaching kids about this event where kids were also killed and tortured etc."
[10:19:26] <feep[work]> on the other, I don't think they're wrong about the position of the school board, this is just not something usually noticed because schoolboards are generally ideologically aligned or at least sufficiently sneaky
[10:20:04] <feep[work]> in a "what's water?" way
[10:20:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> I think this actually calls into question the very notion of public education, at least in a society like the U.S.
[10:21:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> We don't actually have a notion of "elected / public official(s) X should serve their constituents *and no one else* (and in particular, not: (a) the rest of the country, (b) Our Shared Ideals As A Society, (c) humanity, (d) all of the above)"
[10:21:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> We did once, maybe! But we sure don't now
[10:23:04] <feep[work]> I don't think you ever did
[10:23:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> Maybe not
[10:23:15] <feep[work]> but there was the impression that you did, and that does like 70% of the work
[10:23:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah, could be
[10:24:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> Also - and again, almost too obvious to say - but I still have (Soviet, obvs) *children's books* that refer to e.g. World War 2, that quite straightforwardly discuss death, killing, torture, *including of children*, and ... nobody thought that this sort of thing wasn't "age appropriate"?
[10:24:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> My mother bought things like that for me when I was, like... five.
[10:24:27] <feep[work]> yeah, this is a new thing
[10:24:48] <feep[work]> though the past had other weird hangups
[10:24:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> Sure

[10:25:37] <Robomot> 'Maus' is Amazon bestseller after Tennessee school ban ("Maus" is a decades old book about Holocaust survivors. Its ban by a Tennessee school board has sparked renewed interest in it.)
[10:26:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> "“The schoolboard could’ve checked with their book-banning predecessor, [Russia President] Vladimir Putin: he made the Russian edition of  Maus illegal in 2015 (also with good intentions—banning swastikas) and the small publisher sold out immediately and has had to reprint repeatedly,” Spiegelman wrote." ... gosh. There is surely no difference between a school board removing a book from the curriculum, and THE

At an early stage, German attempts to impose the RSHA's direct control over Old Kingdom Jews drew some objections from Mihai Antonescu, but the two sides agreed to a common policy with reference to Soviet Jews. In various of his early 1940s
[11:02:23] <quanticle> statements, Ion Antonescu favorably mentions the Axis goal of eliminating the Jewish presence in the event of victory. The unrestrained character of some Romanian actions toward Jews alarmed Nazi officials, who demanded a methodical form of extermination. When confronted with German decisions to push back Jews he had expelled before the occupation of Transnistria, Antonescu protested, arguing
[11:02:25] <quanticle> that he had conformed with Hitler's decisions regarding 'eastern Jews'. In August 1941, in preparation for the Final Solution's universal application, Hitler remarked: 'As for the Jewish question, today in any case one could say that a man like Antonescu, for example, proceeds much more radically in this manner than we have done until now. But I will not rest or be idle until we too have gone

[11:47:26] <quanticle> Yeah, the strange thing is that here, far-right movements and religiosity are correlated, whereas, at least in Germany the AfD heartland is like... the same as the godless Commie heathen country

[15:12:34] <feep[work]> an example would do better
[15:13:48] <PlanckWalk> .* matches <anything> (including nothing),  so Hello.*Cruel.*World  would match those words with anything between them (or nothing)
[15:14:21] <two2thehead> kuudes, s0ph1a feep : I repeat my pet hypothesis. Autists and Adders tend to *disproportionately* get along, because they have similar genetics and by extension similar personality profiles. https://twitter.com/DegenRolf/status/1488745937438752770

[15:14:26] <PlanckWalk> E.g. in a rule like  s/Hello.*Cruel.*World//  to remove such sections
[15:15:46] <nshepperd2> i don't know how to do anything with sed other than s/a/b/
[15:15:59] <PlanckWalk> I know a bit more, but not a lot more :)
[15:16:26] <nshepperd2> probably because the actual manual is a gnu info thingy
[15:16:34] <PlanckWalk> For anything more complex I'm more likely to use Perl or something
[15:17:25] <PlanckWalk> But yeah, sed has its own programming language that I expect most people using sed never touch.
[15:17:41] <nshepperd2> aint nobody got time to learn info(1)

[15:27:56] <kuudes> PlanckWalk, thanks
[15:28:54] <PlanckWalk> That should be doable with sed, but it's probably going to involve a branch
[15:32:22] <Betawolf> shrinking your way into heaven
[15:33:00] <PlanckWalk> Like, I don't have any experience with it, but something like trying to match a whole line, and replacing it with just the matched portion, and if it matched then print the result out (otherwise don't)
[15:41:44] <PlanckWalk> Yeah, looks like   sed -e 's/^.*\(BB.*DD.*FF\).*/\1/' -e 't' -e 'd'   works.
[15:42:49] <PlanckWalk> I.e. try to match the whole line containing the pattern, replace with just the matched part of the pattern, skip to the end (which prints) if there was a match, otherwise start over on the next line

[23:16:46] <gwern> ggreer: you can't patent or copyright the appearance of a font, only the exact raw binary file
[23:16:54] <ggreer> ah
[23:17:27] <gwern> ggreer: the reason private equity buys this stuff up is because they can turn it into a subscription play with pay per view, and bundle it all up for corporations whose designers insist on the fancy new variable font
[23:18:29] <gwern> old font foundries weren't too profitable because once you sold the actual physical font, it could be reused almost indefinitely, and anyone easily use molds and molten metal to copy the physical font. so you sold at a fixed fee and lost most of the possible revenue
[23:19:23] <gwern> but with digital fonts, you can bundle it all up in a single hosting service and anyone who wants to use *Obama's* campaign font (Gotham) has to pay you $100/month/million-views, say
[23:19:59] <gwern> (use a knockoff Gotham? but it won't have smallcaps or the right kerning! your designer has fainted at your suggestion, how could you do that to her)
[23:21:29] <gwern> it's practically pure profit, and you use your margin to buy up small type foundries and up-and-coming font designers and groups like H&F. you don't do much font development, you just buy it to maintain cashflow
[23:22:31] <gwern> it's a strange market and business, but it winds up subsidizing the creation of lots of new fonts and paying the bills for lots of typographers and designers and artist types so... I guess it's ok
