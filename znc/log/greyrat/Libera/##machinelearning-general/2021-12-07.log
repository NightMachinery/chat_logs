[00:06:21] <SiegeLord> Logistic regression is a type of neual network, a particularly simple one
[00:06:42] <SiegeLord> I wouldn't call it a building block

[00:08:29] <neilthereildeil> in the videos, i think he said that if its only 1 node, then its logistic regression. if you add more layers, its multiple logitic regressions

[00:13:42] <SiegeLord> I'd just forget about that connection and think about the actual building blocks: layer types (linear/affine/convlution etc), activations and losses
[00:14:05] <SiegeLord> logistic regression is just one type of a neural network, that's all there is to it
[00:15:02] <SiegeLord> It's in the same class as things like 'convolutional NN/linear regression/GAN' etc, just a unique name for a particular combination of layers and losses
[00:16:04] <neilthereildeil> what does linear regression have to do with this?
[00:16:12] <neilthereildeil> thats not even using NNs, is it?

[00:16:31] <hodapp> it isn't, though sometimes you'll find architectures that use a linear classifier at the end
[00:16:51] <hodapp> (NN architectures that is)
[00:17:20] <neilthereildeil> whats a good guide to build and validate my implementation of a basic NN?
[00:18:51] *** Joins: Andrynet (~Andrynet@190.152.202.181)
[00:19:05] <hodapp> at one point fast.ai had good courses for this, though this was years ago and I don't know if they've kept up to date
[00:19:32] <SiegeLord> That's a funny statement to read, when logistic and linear regression are literally the same model with a tiny difference up top :P
[00:21:11] <hodapp> they are, but basic linear & logistic regression on their own are almost always done without neural nets
[00:22:32] <neilthereildeil> my understanding of logistic regression is that its just a linear combination in the for AX+B, and we can turn it into a NN by layering the AX+B nodes
[00:22:57] <neilthereildeil> form*
[00:23:33] <SiegeLord> With activations in between them as well, of course
[00:23:59] <SiegeLord> Those 'linear combinations' are typically called affine or dense layers

[22:41:21] <taeaad> There is a limit to your efficiency as a programmer or ML specialist based on simple notions of competition.
[22:43:26] <hodapp> simple notions of competition?
[22:44:09] <taeaad> You are an amoeba and when you grow larger, another amoeba gets gobbled up. If it were about efficiency we would all just use one programming language to rule them all. And YES it would be Lisp, don't argue with me. Instead, one should think about creativity and art too. Your worth has almost nothing to do with your competitive ranking. I'm sure that some unnamed artist living in the 1500s in Italy or 1200s in Bagdad or 50 BC in Greece
[22:44:09] <taeaad> is "worth" more than many "important" people that you know of today.
[22:45:30] <taeaad> To put it differently, I think Alan Turing or John von Neumann would become instant experts in ML if they were alive today and they wouldn't have to learn new things; they would just continue their work on new hardware.
[22:46:12] <taeaad> But today there are no Turings or von Neumanns as rock stars. There is Zuck, Gates, and other people that are extremely boring.

[22:47:47] <taeaad> But anyway, to be more concrete, most jobs in ML or programming just cycle along to someone else if you quit your job. So that's what I mean in terms of competition. There are n pigeon holes, and n + m pigeons.
[22:50:19] <taeaad> To be fair, there are Turings of the 2020s, but young people are not encouraged to be inventors as much as they are encouraged to be "successful", which essentially boiles down to money.

[22:52:35] <taeaad> hodapp: Do you disagree?
[22:57:18] <taeaad> All I mean is that modern jobs have hard limits simply based on the fact that people are in competition with each other.
