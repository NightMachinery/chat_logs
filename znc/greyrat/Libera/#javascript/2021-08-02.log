[01:40:33] <sheetjs> do you need the date of week number of the name of the day?
[01:41:04] <sheetjs> e.g. Sun or Sunday or 0
[01:41:49] <sheetjs> the excel format "\\*yyyy\\*-\\*mm\\*-\\*dd\\*\\|\\*ddd\\*\\|\\*hh\\*\\|\\*mm\\*\\|\\*ss\\*\\|" does everything except for day of week.  It writes Sun or Mon instead of 0 or 1
[01:42:17] <GreenJello> cthulchu, padStart isn't ES5
[01:42:38] <cthulchu> really? well, then I cheated
[01:42:46] <GreenJello> copy/paste a polyfill :-)
[01:42:52] <cthulchu> no.
[01:42:58] <cthulchu> I don't want to support ES5

[01:50:52] <sheetjs> that doesnt always work

[03:26:42] <celphi> ok sheetjs maybe you can figure out this prob
[03:29:48] <celphi> i have customers with websites- i want to embed a form into all their websites which i can update at any time. whenever those customers have that form submitted i need to know from which customer it is. And prevent it from being abused (ie, copying a token in form from a non-user and submit fake data)

[03:31:01] <sheetjs> we were talking about dynamically generated JS yesterday
[03:31:12] <celphi> i got real close by using <scrpit src="mysite"> and my site sends them html with a form in it that it attached to their dom. i even have their window.location.href in the form,. but how can i determine the requet is coming from them specifically
[03:31:31] <sheetjs> practically you have two approaches
[03:31:36] <celphi> but a "bad' user could just send that url
[03:31:51] <sheetjs> sure, do you have a list of the customers?
[03:31:58] <celphi> i can white list them
[03:32:02] <celphi> their domains
[03:32:24] <sheetjs> i mean, you can generate a token that's just a hash of a date token + domain
[03:32:37] <celphi> generate on my server?
[03:32:47] <sheetjs> yeah
[03:32:58] <celphi> yes- but not sure how to embed it into form
[03:33:10] <sheetjs> your JS can attach it to the form
[03:33:34] <celphi> let me show you what i have
[03:33:37] <sheetjs> to give a simple example
[03:33:44] <optimant> I think you might also want to separate the two concerns: 1) identifying the origin, and 2) protecting from spoofed submissions
[03:34:24] <sheetjs> the attack models are similar
[03:34:38] <optimant> identifying the origin can be like sheetjs mentioned, hash a secret and a customer id or something so you can match it up. then use a different tool like captcha to make it hard to submit by automated spam bot
[03:36:45] <celphi> https://bpa.st/OY4A
[03:37:04] <celphi> there's some php in it
[03:37:36] <celphi> but the idea is the customer just has two tags: the src script requesting this page and a div handle to attach the form to
[03:37:47] <sheetjs> if you are using PHP
[03:37:53] <sheetjs> you can inject values into the JS that you server
[03:38:14] <sheetjs> e.g. var x = <?= $identifier ?>
[03:38:17] <celphi> yes- but the problem is a "bad" user can open dom
[03:38:26] <celphi> and see that identfier
[03:38:32] <celphi> and use it
[03:38:34] <sheetjs> sure and copy it to a different request
[03:39:06] <sheetjs> is the attack someone trying to replicate the entire request, or someone trying to obfuscate the origin of the request?
[03:39:07] <celphi> i dont want a bad user just looking aat identifier and sending requests using it
[03:39:16] <celphi> replicate request
[03:39:29] <sheetjs> replicate, including the origin correct?
[03:39:33] <sheetjs> or trying to change the origin?
[03:39:36] <GreenJello> as we previously discussed, all you can really do is make it inconvenient to automate
[03:39:53] <celphi> yeah that appears to be so
[03:40:06] <celphi> but even inconvenient how would you even do that
[03:40:15] <sheetjs> thats why catchas exist
[03:40:18] <sheetjs> *captchas
[03:41:28] <celphi> yeah - im just thinking there has to be another way
[03:42:10] <celphi> google maps use something similiar. how are they are to prevent me from using someone else's map api
[03:43:26] <sheetjs> strictly speaking they can't.  you could theoretically sift through the code, deobfuscate, take every reference to their API endpoint and direct it to yours
[03:45:09] <celphi> if you look at the html  https://developers.google.com/maps#add-major-features.-write-minimal-code.
[03:45:12] <celphi> tab
[03:45:27] <GreenJello> google maps is only concerned with how many queries you perform with the api key
[03:45:34] <optimant> they also use referer: header restrictions to keep others from just putting the embed code in another site
[03:45:47] <optimant> which you could do. someone could spoof the referer headers if they wish though
[03:45:49] <GreenJello> filtering out abuse can be best-effort, since it only matters for billing
[03:46:29] <GreenJello> the cost per request is also very low
[03:47:23] <optimant> also worth sitting down and writing out your threat model, what are you looking to actually prove - that it's a human, that it's a human with one site open and not another, etc.
[03:47:34] <celphi> yeah but i cannot restrict the # of forms a given site can submit
[03:47:40] <celphi> those forms are for their customers
[03:48:27] <celphi> referrer is prob only way
[03:48:29] *** Joins: silly (~silly@user/silly)
[03:48:43] <optimant> without knowing more about the full request, I think tagging the origin with a 'from:' key, and/or using referer headers to match those keys with expected referers, is adequate to tell you which site something came from. but that won't stop spam bots because they'll just spoof headers like a real request
[03:49:21] <optimant> a captcha is the current state of user experience/expectation on how to prove it's a human filling out the form and not a bot.
[03:49:25] <GreenJello> or just automate usage of a legit site, which is nearly zero effort if you don't have a captcha
[03:50:35] <lind{at}yahoo> I'm stumped GreenJello
[03:50:37] <GreenJello> no matter how you try to obscure it, if they can use the form that normal users use...
[03:50:51] <lind{at}yahoo> according to all the docs this should be working
[03:51:04] <celphi> what if i used an iframe- is it possible to capture domain of parent window?
[03:51:35] <celphi> actually nvm that could just be spoofed too
[03:52:46] *** Joins: entuland (~entuland@user/entuland)
[03:52:53] <GreenJello> celphi, if you're not going to require authentication, then decide if you want to require a captcha, and put the rest of your effort into working out what information you need to track to deal with spam after it's entered

[07:16:11] <pavonia> How would you split a string into an array using a regex, such that you can transform the parts matched and the parts not matched with two different functions?
[07:17:13] <pavonia> Splitting first and mapping with a second pass that matches again would be a solution, but not the most efficent one

[07:47:05] <Xatenev> hello
[07:47:44] <Xatenev> I have an array of objects, I want to sort it either by column A, by column B, or if the object has a specific property set to `null` then it should be on top (first entry always)
[07:49:25] <Xatenev> is the following logic correct for that: https://bpa.st/PW7A
[07:49:29] <GreenJello> lodash's sortBy/orderBy are useful here
[07:49:39] <Xatenev> I am using the normal js .sort function
[07:50:03] <Xatenev> if (record1.parentId === null) { return -1 } seems wrong because I am only asking for the value of record1 and don't care about record2
[07:50:07] <Xatenev> but it seems to work
[07:50:11] <Xatenev> so I just wanted to confirm whether this is correct
[07:50:38] <GreenJello> that would be fine if you're sure only one or fewer will be null
[07:51:01] <GreenJello> but your code has other issues, when the prop1 fields aren't equal
[07:51:02] <Xatenev> I will always only have one entry that is `null`
[07:51:11] *** Quits: Drgonz0 (Drgonz0@107-179-254-222.cpe.teksavvy.com) ()
[07:51:23] <Xatenev> if I would have multiple entries that are null, the top values would be 'unsorted' right?
[07:51:27] <GreenJello> oh, misread because indentation is off
[07:51:39] <Xatenev> sorry, it didn't copy very well over :(
[07:51:43] <GreenJello> they would be in arbitrary order
[07:51:46] <Xatenev> yep
[07:51:50] <Xatenev> makes sense
[07:51:59] <Xatenev> ok this will work for me then
[07:52:00] <Xatenev> thank you
[07:52:12] <GreenJello> your code doesn't ever return 0
[07:52:17] <GreenJello> which isn't correct
[07:52:40] <GreenJello> unless you're assuming none of them are equal
[07:52:44] <Xatenev> hm
[07:53:12] <Xatenev> this check should be inside if(sortColumn1 === sortColumn2) right
[07:53:12] <GreenJello> it's really hard to get this wrong with a sortBy function
[07:53:23] <Xatenev> ehh
[07:53:30] <Xatenev> its called differently in the paste, my bad
[07:53:43] <Xatenev> if (/record1.prop1 === record2.prop1)
[07:53:55] <GreenJello> you could do nested ternaries, or extra if/elses
[07:54:22] <GreenJello> you need to check for any 2 of >, <, or =
[07:54:23] <Xatenev> https://bpa.st/KETA
[07:54:25] <GreenJello> for each field
[07:54:34] <Xatenev> something like that would work I guess?

[19:46:35] <Ownix> I should add some details... the site uses cookie authentication, the ajax calls are to a local API hosted with the app. Will ajax respond to a challenge?
[19:47:02] <wroathe> dka: So the application of useMemo should consider the performance characteristics of the function that's being memoized
[19:47:30] <wroathe> dka: If you're only ever dealing with 10 stocks, and if useOffer is relatively fast, then it wouldn't make sense to use useMemo here
[19:47:50] <dka> what do you mean by 10 stocks ?
[19:48:00] <rg> Ownix: probably something like $.ajax(..).error(() => login())
[19:48:03] <wroathe> dka: offer.stocks.find(({ id }) => id === bookingState.stockId)
[19:48:14] <rg> i think you can install a global handler as well
[19:48:15] <wroathe> dka: If you're dealing with 10,000 stocks here, then yes useMemo would be a great idea

[19:48:49] <dka> I am more concern of the re-rendering
[19:48:50] <Ownix> rg: damn, well my ajax calls are EVERYWHERE and I just converted to backend for frontend pattern with cookies to stop handling and using access tokens in my browser. So going to every ajax call and registering a catch/error handler is unfortunately out of the question.
[19:49:08] <rg> i think you can do it globally
[19:49:16] <Ownix> I might write the cookie expiration to the page and force a page refresh on expiration for each request.
[19:49:26] <dka> because I see re-rendering and triggered react-query in production that we can't understand why since the components trigger to many times it must be rerendering and rerendering that are different from our prepreoduction and we do not have sequential logging
[19:49:38] <rg> Ownix: https://api.jquery.com/ajaxError/
[19:49:46] <dka> we see a bunch of issue here we cannot understand, and all I know si I fixed one using useCallback, I believe, memo, useMemo, useCallback will save the app
[19:49:55] <dka> the optimize later philosophy is not so realistic
[19:49:57] <wroathe> dka: Well, that's now what useMemo is for
[19:50:01] <wroathe> that's not*
[19:50:08] <wroathe> "You may rely on useMemo as a performance optimization, not as a semantic guarantee. In the future, React may choose to “forget” some previously memoized values and recalculate them on next render, e.g. to free memory for offscreen components. Write your code so that it still works without useMemo — and then add it to optimize performance."

[19:53:42] <wroathe> See that blurb in the React documentation I just linked
[19:53:58] <dka> and how to prevent such bugs happening at any cost, and so far, not using useMemo/useCallback, lead to problem in production, so what is the cost of using useMemo/useCallback in every hook compare to that ?
[19:55:09] <dka> I've been reading this doc over and over
[19:56:30] <wroathe> dka: Well, understand then that that blurb was explicitly written for people in your situation. They're trying to speak directly to you.
[19:58:49] <dka> ok, so the conclusion is that developer can't agree on when to use those hooks, so we do not use them, and if we do, we know why we use them
[19:59:05] <dka> let the problem arrive, and let the fix arrive, that's how it is react.
[19:59:20] <wroathe> That sounds like a good practice in general
[19:59:27] <dka> That sound like a bad library
[19:59:37] <dka> and I love react.
[19:59:43] <wroathe> Or you could come up with another abstraction that isn't useMemo based

[22:19:19] <sheetjs> book was released in 1995, not enough royalties to continue the project and make a second edition
[22:19:46] <sheetjs> apparently i was the first person in 10 years to reach out about it
[22:25:47] <Rockwood> sheetjs, o/

[23:52:47] <sheetjs> anyone use vmware
[23:53:08] <sheetjs> so for whatever reason, it has an option to connect or disconnect the entire floppy drive but no option to eject the disk
[23:54:35] <silly> i never knew about floppies with automated ejection
[23:54:41] <silly> just the manual button
[23:55:13] <GreenJello> I think they mean from outside the VM
[23:55:22] <GreenJello> simulating clicking the eject button
[23:55:32] <silly> you mean unmount?
[23:55:56] <silly> s/manual/mechanical/
[23:56:09] <GreenJello> a virtual machine with a virtual floppy drive
[23:56:32] <silly> mount/unmount is done in the vm
[23:56:41] <ljharb> silly: every mac's floppy disk drive ever made had automatic ejection
[23:56:44] <matsaman> software-level eject of a floppy disk, dunno if I've ever seen that
[23:56:51] <matsaman> maybe they just didn't think to implement it
[23:56:52] <silly> ljharb, wOot
[23:56:55] <sheetjs> that's not an option when booting dos
[23:57:07] <sheetjs> i need to create a state where the floppy drive exists but has no disk in it
[23:57:19] <sheetjs> and it appears the only way to do that is to remove the floppy drive and create a new one
[23:57:41] <ljharb> matsaman: again, every mac has that
[23:57:48] <teut> Uploaded file: https://uploads.kiwiirc.com/files/eb20bb50b8925c8ef8bd86bd1730ed19/pasted.txt
[23:57:50] <ljharb> (until they stopped including floppy drives ofc)
[23:57:59] <matsaman> I admit I didn't deal with many Mac machines during floppy drive years
[23:58:07] <ljharb> also any external disk drive i've seen in the 90s
[23:58:11] <matsaman> just like most everyone else =P
[23:58:18] <ljharb> the button is only for when the software mechanism fails
[23:58:27] *** Joins: pulse (~pulse@user/pulse)
[23:58:39] <teut> shouldnt the Object.values(..) of this  give me an array of [{        "type": "text", ...   }, ]    objects?
[23:58:45] <matsaman> sounds about right, given Apple's later buttonless CD drives
[23:59:26] <GreenJello> teut, yes
[23:59:40] <GreenJello> minus the []s
[23:59:46] <teut> because I m getting  [{name:{        "type": "text", ...   },  age:{...}             } ]
