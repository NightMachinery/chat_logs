[01:55:48] <quanticle> Oboromot\Arcturus, gwern: Well, it's not stated in the movies, but in the Extended Universe novels, it's stated that Boba Fett uses the money to collect Mandalorian artifacts (including spares for his armor) and upgrade his ship.

[01:57:41] <quanticle> Also it looks cool

[01:57:47] <gwern> quanticle: yes, it is an expensive business and you're right that the bounty hunter war trilogy does emphasize how much money he has to spend on "collectibles" etc, but that's not really a motivation itself, just a major cost of doing business
[01:58:42] <gwern> hm, I'm not sure about the holiday special. it's been an extremely long time since I watched it. in the movies, fett is too awesome to ever be cut by a lightsaber
[01:59:10] <gwern> (be cut? by some rank amateur like luke? how embarassing)
[01:59:41] <quanticle> We don't ever see Boba Fett's armor stopping a lightsaber. The closest it comes to a lightsaber is when Luke deflects a blaster bolt into Boba Fett's jetpack while he's fighting to rescue Han Solo from the clutches of Jabba the Hutt. That causes the jet pack to explode, catapulting Boba Fett over the side of the hoverbarge and into the waiting mouth of the Sarlacc.
[01:59:41] <Betawolf> tbh he mostly seemed good compared to all the other people chasing the jedi. Maybe the armor negates plot shielding.
[02:00:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> Did Boba Fett survive that sarlacc or what
[02:00:13] <gwern> yes, in the EU
[02:00:16] <quanticle> Not stated in the movies; in the EU novels he does.
[02:00:52] <gwern> the jet pack doesn't explode, it just goes off. in the EU short story, that's how he escapes the sarlacc, iirc - he makes it explode, killing the sarlacc and almost killing himself
[02:01:12] <quanticle> And the novels do state that his armor protects him from the acid of the Sarlacc's digestive system, allowing him to throw a bunch of grenades into its entrails, killing it and allowing him to crawl out.
[02:01:36] <quanticle> Oh right, Luke's deflection merely ignites the jetpack, catapulting Boba Fett over the side.
[02:02:14] <gwern> 'After conversing with a fellow captive, the Choi known as Susejo, Fett discovered that this being was actually psychologically connected to the Sarlacc—and it was this advantage that he used to goad the creature into contracting around his jet pack, igniting the device and providing his means of escape. The resulting explosion, combined with the beast's acidic stomach juices, left Fett on...

[02:33:39] <saturn2> taking horse ivermectin doesn't seem obviously irrational

[02:36:07] <gwern> no, it was obviously irrational at every step of the game. the prior was extremely small, on the order of one in thousands that a random drug in the pharmacopia would be useful, the bayesian evidence of the initial trials was maybe a few dozen at best considering small study biases, the effect size dropped like a stone in higher quality studies, the outright fraud completely neutralized the...
[02:36:13] <gwern> ...value of the initial studies and sucked away most of the value of future studies...
[02:36:30] <gwern> 'few side effects' is not enough for a treatment to justify its cost and crowding out other treatments and things to research

[02:43:23] <Betawolf> how does the fraudulent paper neutralise the value of studies before and after?
[02:44:02] <gwern> Betawolf: because they are even more likely to also be fraudulent
[02:44:15] <Betawolf> Are they by the same people?
[02:44:54] <gwern> sometimes. even if they are not, it is evidence about the area's standards and what kinds of people do the research and the research practices. there is also a direct biasing effect when people 'know' that it works (based on fraud)
[02:45:09] <gwern> if you get a null, it's harder to publish when 'everyone knows it's *proven* to work'
[02:45:44] <gwern> "didn't you see that amazing paper with n=500 and p<0.0001? you must've screwed up"
[02:46:38] <gwern> this was a thing with stapel, people having problems publishing their failures to replicate his fraud. I also ran into this with dual n-back - people who ran active control papers would tell me how the reviewers would pan their nulls because everyone knew DNB works
[02:46:39] <Betawolf> Well now there's a biasing effect the other way, because that paper being fraud is half of what anyone knows about that drug. And it seems like quite a power to hand people: publish one fraudulent paper and you can discredit an entire line of research.
[02:47:02] <gwern> it's a minor power because the prior probability is so small to begin with
[02:49:32] <ggreer> my evaluation of bret weinstein went from "interesting and careful thinker" to "wtf is this guy smoking" because of his stance on mRNA vaccines and ivermectin
[02:51:08] <gwern> (to expand out what I mean about the tiny prior: there's something like 20,000 approved drugs or supplements which constitute the universe of quickly usable substances. of these, only a handful, maybe even only 1 or 2, will ever turn out to be useful. for coronavirus, the whole passel of ivermectin and hydroxy and ritonavir on and on and on has largely reduced down to like... dexamethasone,...
[02:51:14] <gwern> ...remdesvir, and maybe vitamin d? so you're trying to locate things with a base rate of like 3/20,000+
[02:52:31] <gwern> ggreer: welp, that's pretty much what I thought of the weinsteins beforehand. I'm annoyed to be even one or two degrees away from them in terms of 'intellectual darkweb' webbiness
[02:54:05] <saturn2> Obormot\Arcturus: obviously you have to actually look at the ingredients
[02:54:13] <ggreer> eric seemed like he was optimizing for grand visions, but bret's ideas about the cancer/resilience tradeoff and lab mice telomeres seemed really cool
[02:54:33] <ggreer> also he did have a paper from 2000 that predicted something like vioxx would happen
[02:55:02] <saturn2> ggreer: he's gone all in on the grift, it seems
[02:56:05] <Betawolf> It actually seems like any future studies that find an effect for ivermectin could be expected to be _more_ reliable than before the fraud, because you know that a finding agreeing with fraud will have been scrutinised to hell by everyone in the chain, given how much shit they'd get.
[02:57:02] <ggreer> I have no idea wtf to think about him because almost any argument against mRNA vaccines is an argument against a new vaccine. mRNA can be targeted much more specifically. if mRNA tech existed 30 years ago, we'd be using it exclusively. attenuated/dead viruses would be too risky
[02:57:27] <gwern> Betawolf: so, if a paper on how psi makes homeopathy and astrology comes out tomorrow, will you believe it without even reading it? it must be *ultra* reliable

The keyboard imprint came into existence on one fateful day when Sole walked past the street and saw a wet patch of cement.

[05:12:40] <feepbot> parlance of everyone’s subconscious, a whore. It was easy. I commissioned boudoir portraits to put on myRedBook, the now-defunct erotic review website that San Francisco Bay-area johns frequented. I wrote a hyperbolic ad about how pretty and smart I was, and I started getting emails right away. Servicing clients was a mix of poignant and irritating–many of them were lonely, and
[05:12:40] <feepbot> it was obvious why. But others were sweet, kind, and delightful to spend time with. I remain friends with one of my former clients to this day. Facebook shows me photos of his puppy all the time...Was it a good experience? Mostly no, but it was a mixed bag. I made a lot of money, which was great, but atypical for a sex worker, especially globally speaking. (Prostitution is not
[05:12:45] <feepbot> particularly remunerative unless you’re already societally privileged: white, not transgender, with a middle-class background and no addictions. There are exceptions, of course, but this is the tendency.) I got burned out and quit after roughly five months.

[07:42:18] <gwern> oof. it shouldn't be trying to cross at all with a car in play
[07:42:25] <gwern> now it's learned a bad lesson
[07:43:07] <quanticle> Maybe
[07:45:23] <quanticle> I think if the choice came down to wearing a high-vis jacket and being an indoor cat, the cat would choose the high-vis jacket.
[07:48:21] <gwern> I'm questioning if the high-vis jacket is worse than useless if it's teaching dangerous lessons like "you can safely run out in front of a car (this time)"
[07:49:51] <rmmh> be the change you want to see in the world. be the force of natural selection against animals in the road

[09:56:46] <ggreer> I'm guessing the author collected stories, but they were legends. the book was written in 1985, so stories from 65 were already pretty dicey

[13:03:45] <CoJaBo> I actually have no idea how, but it recognizes stuff it wasn't trained to recognize lol
[13:08:16] <PapuaHardyNet> since no one got the Gurken Mark II reference, I'm compelled to explain it (https://codegeass.fandom.com/wiki/Guren_Type-02)
[13:08:17] <Robomot> Guren Type-02 | Code Geass Wiki | Fandom (The Guren Mk-II (紅蓮弐式, Guren' Nishiki) was a prototype Knightmare Frame model designed by Indian engineer Rakshata Chawla, manufactured by Japan, and built by the Kyoto House. It is radically different from its Britannian counterparts, and its technology is on par with most seventh generation...)
[13:10:05] <CoJaBo> I know some of those words
[13:16:51] <PapuaHardyNet> that's all right. I thought a lelouch + gurkenglas reference would be cool
[13:17:20] <PapuaHardyNet> on that note, I wonder how gurkenglas would fare if he was in lelouch's shoes in the start of code geass
[13:18:24] <PapuaHardyNet> probably better than lelouch, let's be honest
[13:18:58] <Gurkenglas> Never consumed that, what's my starting situation and powerset?
[13:19:45] <PapuaHardyNet> you get the power to order anyone to do what you want them to do, but you can give the order to them only once, and you have to look at them eye to eye to give them the order
[13:20:23] <Gurkenglas> How do I find this out?
[13:20:51] <PapuaHardyNet> supernatural telepathy between you and the girl
[13:21:31] <PapuaHardyNet> starting situation: you are in a shack surrounded by soldiers with guns who plan on killing you, and you are in a ghetto currently being massacred by that same soldiers, who also have mechas.
[13:22:13] <Gurkenglas> Presumably they don't know I have this power, or Lelouch would have been toast.
[13:22:32] <Gurkenglas> Mechas without visors?
[13:22:38] <PapuaHardyNet> yes
[13:22:54] <PapuaHardyNet> soldiers in the shack aren't in mechas of course, they are on foot with guns
[13:23:41] <PapuaHardyNet> its outside that mechas are going around destroying the city. you have a resistance group somewhere in the city who are piloting mechas trying to fight back but are losing, and a train full of mechas for soldiers arriving in 15 minutes.
[13:24:14] <Gurkenglas> Is it common knowledge that this power exists and that master/stranger protocols are a thing?
[13:24:39] <rsaarelm> No.
[13:25:21] <rsaarelm> Don't remember if the military started figuring it out later on either.
[13:25:22] <Gurkenglas> "Can I order them to serve us?"
[13:25:51] <rsaarelm> Permanent and very open-ended orders seemed to work fine.
[13:26:26] <Gurkenglas> "Do they notice orders until one compels them?"
[13:26:33] <PapuaHardyNet> nope
[13:26:45] <rsaarelm> They don't seem to figure out it happened afterwards either.
[13:27:01] <PapuaHardyNet> unless they have extreme willpower, then they can and also attempt to stop themselves (but will fail to stop)
[13:27:05] <nshepperd2> there's an explicit memory wipe effect
[13:27:47] <PapuaHardyNet> re the girl: the girl who gives you the power just took a headshot for you, and you are next
[13:28:17] <PapuaHardyNet> she gives you the power after getting a headshot
[13:28:18] <Gurkenglas> Well, in-character all of this of course goes much faster than we are talking here. I tell him to help me.
[13:28:21] <Gurkenglas> Oh.
[13:28:45] <PapuaHardyNet> (after she gets a headshot)
[13:30:12] <Gurkenglas> Well, if the situation is that she dies and a gun turns in my direction and I hear a voice in my head that I can command by eye contact the first thing i say is Stop, of course.
[13:30:13] *** Joins: CryptoDavid (uid14990@id-14990.uxbridge.irccloud.com)
[13:30:58] <nshepperd2> tbh as much as lelouch fucked everything up, I feel like he could have done way worse
[13:32:33] <Gurkenglas> and then she tells me it only works once per person and unless more are streaming in i take the gun from the poor fella that just stopped breathing. and push him over so it's less suspiscious.
[13:32:33] <PapuaHardyNet> so they stop trying to kill you, but now they are a liability since they know you are there and you can't stop them from trying to kill you again.
[13:33:26] <PapuaHardyNet> the interpretation of the command has an effect on how they obey the order. asking them to stop breathing means they'll do their best until they pass out.
[13:33:38] <nshepperd2> i don't wanna know what kind of insane scheme Gurkenglas would concoct to completely ruin civilization
[13:34:21] <Gurkenglas> i mean until you mentioned soldiers i was about to go "do i do better than lelouch by not going around deliberately making powerful enemies?"
[13:34:57] <rsaarelm> Seems like "*start working for me*" would be a pretty good all-purpose thing for the command voice.
[13:35:26] <rsaarelm> Or "become loyal only to me"
[13:35:42] <Gurkenglas> yeah, the only disadvantage is it loses the memory wipe part.
[13:36:06] <Gurkenglas> is the memory wipe only of the contents of the order? is she in my head forever?
[13:36:39] <rsaarelm> Yeah, once it becomes obvious too early that you're co-opting high ranking officials left and right someone's gonna drop a nuke on you or something.
[13:37:35] <Gurkenglas> yeah from what you said it doesnt sound like i can make them act natural.
[13:38:25] <kuudes> oh dang. first snow here.
[13:39:54] <Gurkenglas> rsaarelm, if she goes "or 'become loyal only to me'", i reply "oh, i can make them happy about it?"
[13:40:38] <Gurkenglas> is there a limit to how long i can make the order?
[13:41:23] <PapuaHardyNet> hold up: the girl telepathically communicates your power. You use your power by looking into someones eye and speaking your order to them verbally. your eye forms a geass that, when the other person looks at it, is compelled to follow your order.
[13:41:29] <PapuaHardyNet> no limit to the length of the order.
[13:42:01] <Gurkenglas> ah so i can start saying it when i spot them
[13:42:08] <PapuaHardyNet> yes
[13:42:31] <Gurkenglas> and the girl is in fact in my head forever, yes?
[13:43:56] <PapuaHardyNet> she communicated telepathically with you, but she is actually immortal, so no, she's not in your head. the power is not removable from you either, not unless you willingly relinquish it (like the girl did to her instance of geass)
[13:44:26] <PapuaHardyNet> you can control when you can "geass" someone so you can look into people's eyes and not geass everyone
[13:44:50] <Gurkenglas> people with geass can pass it on, it has different powers per person, and the powers it grants are generally active abilities?
[13:45:27] <PapuaHardyNet> correct, however the methods and ability to pass it on is esoteric. assume you cannot pass yours on or create new powers for others.
[13:45:40] <Gurkenglas> Too bad, that was the obvious line of inquiry :)
[13:47:20] <Gurkenglas> Do I particularly care one way or another about this war?
[13:49:46] <PapuaHardyNet> yes, you are an estranged prince of Brittania who is ruling japan, and you want to take revenge for the death of your mother at the hands of your father, and the way you and your sister were abandoned in Japan as diplomatic pawns after your mother was murdered, even as war occurred
[13:49:58] <PapuaHardyNet> (britannia is ruling japan, not you)
[13:50:46] <PapuaHardyNet> (you don't know who murdered your mother, but your father didn't show like he cared, making him guilty in your eyes, even as you doubt he was responsible)
[13:50:47] <Gurkenglas> What's the tech level?
[13:51:24] <PapuaHardyNet> mecha, nuclear bombs, flying spaceships, smartphones. No AI, no AGI. No advanced biotech.
[13:53:02] <Gurkenglas> my sister is apparently indestructible; does she feel the same way?
[13:53:49] <PapuaHardyNet> your sister is a 14 year old blind cripple, both of which occurred during the murder of your mother
[13:54:44] <Gurkenglas> oh, i thought the girl was my sister.
[13:54:44] <PapuaHardyNet> the girl who just saved you is a stranger, and yes, she is immortal and doesn't feel like you do, although she has made a pact with you - she'll help you achieve your goals, in exchange for something she would want from you in the future
[14:00:42] <feep[work]> slowly we reconstruct the entire first episode
[14:03:53] <Gurkenglas> when ive had a few minutes to think, "forever feel, think and act like you expect i'd endorse" seems like a reasonable order, since i can later inform them that i'm not interested in ~killing them permanently
[14:04:29] <PapuaHardyNet> that's one hell of an order. love it.
[14:04:29] <Gurkenglas> who's attacking, anyway?
[14:04:31] <kuudes> wouldn't "OBEY MY DIRECT ORDERS!" or similar inductional order be the correct one?
[14:04:59] <Gurkenglas> kuudes, then they'd probably drop hints as they resist.
[14:05:20] <kuudes> hmm
[14:06:03] <PapuaHardyNet> your cousin, another prince, rules japan in your place, and his military team keeping the immortal girl captive is attempting to get her back and keep her existence secret from everyone including your father, so genocide is key
[14:06:25] <PapuaHardyNet> s/in your place/in your father's place (you are considered dead)/
[14:06:52] <PapuaHardyNet> really, you should watch the code geass trilogy. it seems like your thing, gurkenglas.
[14:07:03] <Gurkenglas> yeah at this point i should probably watch s01e01.

So (not having had a minute to think) I'd tell them to serve me, and then plan to ask them how we get out of this shit alive, presumably I dress as one of them, and I ask the girl what other powers she has.
[14:36:11] <Gurkenglas> also i'm blindsided by their eyes turning red while they're carrying out my orders, so these ones are not gonna long-term infiltrate anything...

[14:42:31] <Gurkenglas> Does it work on myself? I think about that one for longer than five minutes ^^
[14:47:55] <Gurkenglas> If he never in the series uses "obey me", it's probably just not a valid order, though.

[23:15:46] <feep> null picking implemented!
[23:15:47] *** Joins: srhm (~srhm@user/srhm)
[23:16:20] <feep> ie. now if you have nullable Foo, and you're in a method that has nullable Bar return type, you can do Foo foo <- returnsNullableFoo; and if it's null, it just bails with return null;
[23:16:36] <feep> neat continues its slow evolution into haskell do blocks~
[23:17:26] <feep> this mostly does nothing, but there's like ten lines in the compiler where it looks a lot better like that.
[23:21:42] <kuudes> "this mostly does nothing"... so... null picking?
[23:25:02] <dv^_^> your lang needs more examples I think

[23:28:31] <feep> kuudes: I mean, I judge feature additions by how much they simplify the compiler
[23:28:49] <feep> this is "merely occasionally useful".
[23:28:51] <feep> fills a hole tho.
