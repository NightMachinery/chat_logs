[00:29:20] <mawk> if I got the value right, but I think
[00:29:56] <mawk> I did f(x) = Σ binom(-1/2, n) (-1)^n x^n/(2n+2)² then derived it, got the value, then tried to integrate it

[01:42:31] <nejimban> I may be mistaken
[01:42:34] <mawk> if we define f(x) = Σ binom(1/2, n) (-1)^n x^(2n+2)/(2n+2) then f'(x) = x (stuff + sqrt(1-x²)), so the thing to integrate will be slightly different

[02:19:54] <mawk> why did you do [(1-sqrt(1-x²))ln(x)] though nejimban , for the ibp you integrate x/sqrt(1-x²) and that should give just -sqrt(1-x²) and not 1-sqrt(1-x²)
[02:20:39] <nejimban> problem is -sqrt(1-x^2)/x is not integrable at 0
[02:20:45] <nejimban> but (1-sqrt(1-x^2))/x is

[06:28:34] <Z-module> is q supposed to be prime too?  Or just something coprime to p ?
[06:28:35] <cherim___> If p!=q in |G| = p^kq, then H and N are Sylow p-subgroups of G. If a Sylow subgroup is normal, it's unique.

[06:29:59] <coeus> mawk, thanks but that's not exactly what I needed
[06:30:09] <coeus> very cool though
[06:30:10] <mawk> why?
[06:30:20] <Guest32> Z-module: yes p and q are distinct primes so actually p > q
[06:31:07] <Z-module> If H has index = the smallest prime dividing |G|, then it must be normal, so H and N could not be distinct

[06:31:33] <Z-module> thus, p < q
[06:31:38] <Z-module> (given that they are distinct)
[06:31:41] <mawk> well the area under the curve is -Δ^(3/2)/(6a), there's no way around that
[06:31:59] <mawk> you can rewrite it as -sqrt(Δ)·Δ/(6a) but that won't make it integral
[06:32:04] <coeus> an intergral coefficient is something that you use that gives your fraction of the area

[10:12:40] <rex> Hey I solved y' = 1 + y^2 by dividing by 1 + y^2 and integrating both sides; is there a more elegant way?
[10:14:53] <rex> And under which conditions is true: ∫_a^b f(x) dx = ∫_a^b g(x) dx ⇒ f(x) = g(x)
[10:15:41] <greenbagels> the unicode isnt super clear for me, is that asking when two functions having the same definite integral over the same integral implies they're the same function?
[10:16:00] <rex> yes
[10:16:52] <greenbagels> rex: what are your thoughts?
[10:17:50] <rex> well obviously that's not always true; but I'm thinking about something like when it's true for all b in some interval then the integrands should be equal in that interval
[10:21:17] <rex> and f,g should be continouus else the best one could hope for f=g almost everywhere
[10:21:34] <rex> continuous
[10:24:21] <rex> yeah if ∀b ∈ [a,s]: ∫_a^b f(x) dx = 0 and f is continuous, then f(a) = 0 else I could find an ε-neighborhood of a where f is positive and therefore int from a to a + ε f dx > 0
[10:28:03] <greenbagels> I agree you definitely need continuity
[10:28:13] <greenbagels> And definitely something stronger
[10:29:02] <greenbagels> Since for any integrable function you can just define a second function on the same interval with constant value of (integral value)/(b-a)
[10:30:16] <greenbagels> Unless the question is for any a,b
[10:30:39] <cherim___> "like when it's true for all b in some interval" suggests something

[14:11:24] <riv> hmm
[14:11:26] <riv> im a bit confused actually
[14:11:40] <riv> i want to show forgetful functor U : Grp -> Set is left adjoint to Free : Set -> Grp
[14:12:02] <riv> i.e. htere is a natural (in X and Y) bijection Set(UY,X) ~= Grp(Y,FreeX)
[14:12:26] <riv> so let's take a set map f : UY -> X i want to say this induces a group hom f^bar : Y -> FreeX
[14:14:41] <riv> I'm a bit confused, Y has relationships between its elements.. so how can an arbitrary set map from UY -> X induce a group hom?
[14:14:53] <riv> isn't that too much freedom?

[17:46:06] <Fohsap> Could you guys dumb this down for me, please?
[17:46:25] <Fohsap> ProcedureOnce parental consent was received, a research assistant, trained in the administration of the CMA, met with each child individually in a quiet area of the child’s school to administer the CMA. Children’s correct responses were scored as 1 and incorrect responses were scored as 0. Analyses were conducted on item-level data from the CMA using Mplus 7.4 (Muthén & Muthén, 2013). All items were specified as unordered
[17:46:25] <Fohsap> categorical variables. Four models were evaluated using CCFA to test model fit and the robust weighted least squares mean and variance adjusted (WLSMV) was the estimator. Simulation studies have shown the WLSMV estimator is superior to the maximum likelihood estimator for categorical data both in terms of model rejection rates and appropriate estimation of factor loadings (Beauducel & Herzberg, 2006). The DIFFTEST function in Mplus
[17:46:25] <Fohsap> was used to compare nested models. Statistically significant p-values indicated that the less restricted model resulted in significant improvement of fit. A sandwich estimator was used to account for the nesting of children in preschool classrooms (Asparouhov, 2005). We used a weighted root-mean square residual (WRMR), a fit index calculated for categorical data, with a score close to 1.0 considered to be a good model fit (Yu, 2002).
[17:46:25] <Fohsap> Further, Yu recommended these additional values for indicators of good model fit: the confirmatory fit index (CFI) ≥ .96, and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) ≤ .05 with CFI performing relatively better than Tucker–Lewis index (TLI) and RMSEA. Based on these recommendations, emphasis was given to WRMR and CFI as fit indices in these analyses.
[17:50:14] <mawk> Fohsap: it's nothing very interesting, they just compare the different models they could use to analyze their data
[17:50:48] <mawk> and they discuss which model goodness indicators they use to compare their 4 different models

[20:24:01] <taeaad> Hmm. According to Wikipedia, "Comohology is usually a stronger invariant than homology."
[20:24:15] <munkis> ie. Minesweeper is turing complete
[20:24:19] <Franciman> this is not 100% accurate taeaad
[20:24:30] <Franciman> it's just that in cohomology you can define additional algebraic structure
[20:24:33] <Franciman> in a more natural way
[20:24:46] <Franciman> but you could do the same in singular homology IIUC
[20:24:56] <Franciman> only thing is that with reversed arrows, things look very strange
[20:25:43] <taeaad> Colimits look strange, and for that reason are rather underrated.
[20:26:43] <munkis> Guest12: I was thinking that since minesweeper is kknown to be both turing and NP complete, that should imply that a turing machine can be designed for any NP-complete problem.

[23:26:46] <greenbagels> probability-generating functions...
[23:26:51] <greenbagels> why have i not learned about these before

[23:40:00] <tolarz> greenbagels: which ones?

[23:40:52] <rubiksdream> is a 'doubly connected region' (of the plane) any (connected) open set which has some cycle in it that isn't zero in homology?
[23:41:17] <rubiksdream> and no other cycle that isn't zero in homology that is Z-independent of this cycle?
[23:41:26] <rubiksdream> i.e. its first homology group has free part of rank 1?
[23:42:12] <rubiksdream> so im guessing these regions are basically simply connected regions with one hole
[23:44:40] <rubiksdream> oh okay, 'double' because the maximum number of Z-independent cycles (in homology) is two, one cycle is zero in homology and the other is nonzero in homology and is some multiple of a loop around the one hole
[23:45:13] <rubiksdream> but in terms of actual no. of holes, a k-connected region really has k-1 holes, right?

[23:50:56] <rubiksdream> wait no, a 1-connected region has maximum no. of Z-independent cycles 1, {0,c} is not independent.. what am I thinking, but then its just a stupid name to say 1-connected = 'double connected' region
[23:50:57] <rubiksdream> blegh
[23:51:05] <rubiksdream> and 0-connected = 'simply connected'
[23:51:07] <rubiksdream> terrible
[23:51:48] <riv> I need a physical book, to really study a topic I think
[23:51:55] <riv> i have a PDF of a book but I just dont get through it
[23:52:16] <rubiksdream> hmm, i've been using pdfs for my final year in undergrad over the last year
[23:52:21] <rubiksdream> hopefully i did ok in my finals, lol
[23:52:27] <rubiksdream> i need a first to get into this phd programme
[23:52:29] <riv> wow youre just an undergrad
[23:52:48] <riv> i can't believe the absolute lack of material i covered in my undergrad
[23:52:50] <riv> it's appaling
[23:53:05] <rubiksdream> i agree with you in that when i used to have physical books in high school, i seemed to focus way better
[23:53:21] <rubiksdream> there's the common sense argument of procrastination not being a literal click away
[23:53:47] <riv> maybe if i had a better PDF reader
[23:53:53] <riv> I know that a big part of it is how rubbish my PDF readers are
[23:53:56] <riv> but that is also true
[23:54:00] <rubiksdream> im using 'document viewer' on ubuntu
[23:54:34] <loopspace> For some books, my physical ebook reader is good enough. But for others I need physical. Also supplemented by searches on computer ideally
[23:54:55] <rubiksdream> ah, so is it mostly an issue of pdf quality?
[23:55:03] <rubiksdream> like the print isn't vivid enough
[23:56:13] <rubiksdream> sometimes terrible pdf quality compels me to attempt to follow along the lines of the book until 'theorem,proof' sections appear, and then attempt the proof myself, whereas when im reading a physical copy i have a feeling i would be tempted to just keep reading the proof before attempting some parts of it myself
[23:56:29] <loopspace> For me it's a number things. random access, visual memory of where certain things are located, the lack of distractions whenbaway from electronics

[23:58:02] <rubiksdream> i do miss the feel of a physical book
[23:58:50] <Z-module> physical books are, to me, superior in all ways other than text-searching
[23:58:53] <loopspace> I have way too many physical books gathered over the years. Can't help it through
[23:59:05] <Z-module> (well, also copy/paste quoting)
