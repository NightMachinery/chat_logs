[18:56:58] <unfinity> ・゜゜・。 ​ 。・゜゜\_ö​< QU​ACK!
[18:56:58] <joepie91> I have no up-to-date recommendations other than "I've only had good experiences with Samsung displays so far"

[18:57:01] <unfinity> Well this is awkward, the duck needs to think about it. You can try again in 7 seconds.
[18:57:03] <Dragoon> Seems to be pretty well reviewed

[18:57:05] <unfinity> Dragoon you befriended a duck in 7.716 seconds! You have made friends with 1 duck in #datahoarder.
[18:57:09] <joepie91> I've only had one iiyama screen and it was trash
[18:57:16] <joepie91> so sample size 1 but uh yeah
[18:57:29] <joepie91> also over the years I've heard many people mention that Dell does good affordable displays
[18:57:30] <Dragoon> I had... 4 samsung screens
[18:57:40] <Dragoon> The 2 that are actually mine have been trash

[18:57:53] <Dragoon> My budget is €400

[19:00:09] <x10> +1 on the dell's, decent price/specs last 5 i bought where dells
[19:01:02] <Dragoon> Dell screens are good for like office spaces, but I don't know how they are in 144Hz territory
[19:01:17] <ThePendulum> they use the same LG panels that are in a lot of other brands
[19:01:33] *** Quits: `St0ner (~services@user/st0ner/x-3205467) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[19:01:41] <x10> no idea about 144hz stuff tbh but what yeah LG panels
[19:02:22] <ThePendulum> been using dell for the past 10 years, iiyama is also pretty decent although the one I own personally is like 15 years old
[19:03:51] <ThePendulum> I wanted to upgrade to a Dell S2721DGFA which is 4k 165Hz for €400, I haven't yet because UI scaling is horrible in linux :(
[19:03:52] <ThePendulum> err not 4K, 1440p
[19:04:09] <ThePendulum> that one was the one I considered after realizing 4K is going to be a mess in linux
[19:05:05] <Emelie> ime it's already a lot better today than it was a couple of years ago
[19:05:28] <Emelie> I have a 1440p monitor and I can't remember the last time I had scaling issues
[19:05:44] <ThePendulum> didn't go for it because 1080p 23" to 1440p 27" is a bit of a marginal upgrade, 60Hz to 165Hz should be great but one of the primary reasons I want to upgrade is because I can "see the pixels" when reading text
[19:06:00] <ThePendulum> do you use anything but 100% at 1440p?
[19:06:28] <ThePendulum> wayland has better scaling support, but nvidia drivers don't have good wayland support, that's supposed to change
[19:06:56] <Emelie> I do, and it works
[19:07:04] *** Quits: jess (~jess@libera/staff/jess) ()
[19:07:09] <Emelie> Although I'm still on X11 because nvidia
[19:07:44] <ThePendulum> interesting, looked into and played around with it a bit, didn't seem like anything but 2x was going to be tolerable
[19:10:55] <Dragoon> I'm still on X11 cause I'm too lazy to switch
[19:11:02] <Dragoon> And because I use bspwm
[19:11:27] <Dragoon> cba to switch to sway and relearn that
[19:11:52] <Dragoon> and have to find 2147483647 replacements for all the tools I use
[19:13:40] <Dragoon> Any experiences with 10bit color depth on linux?
[19:13:40] <ThePendulum> what else doesn't work on wayland?
