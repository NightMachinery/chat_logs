[17:42:49] <sobel> how Bad is leiningen these days? i'm still using it
[17:43:47] <opqdonut> I think it's still the best thing for libraries
[17:44:03] <opqdonut> the clojars publishing features are better than for others
[17:44:41] <opqdonut> for a complex build maybe tools.build is nicer
[17:44:58] <opqdonut> but trying to do anything nontrivial by chaining deps.edn aliases is a nightmare
[17:45:02] <opqdonut> and boot is just deprecated
[17:45:34] <aphyr> phew, managed to avoid learning boot long enough for it to not be necessary any more ;-)
[17:45:53] <opqdonut> some things are only available as lein plugins, some are only available as deps.edn aliases...
[17:46:09] <sobel> Lein has treated me well over the years.
[17:46:38] <opqdonut> I see no problem with just using leiningen for now
[17:47:26] <sobel> i'm still hoping to start a new reagent project with fighwheel and it would be nice if i didn't have to ditch lein
[17:47:47] <opqdonut> a "killer feature" for deps.edn is depending on github projects and skipping clojars altogether
[17:47:56] <Para> Leiningen in actuality is still the best.
[17:48:16] <opqdonut> for CLJS I have no idea what the best solution is
[17:48:21] <Para> There just seems to be some kind of weird schism going and I doubt it's worth even going into really. Probably some long term continuation from the whole "Open source isn't about you" thing.
[17:48:27] <opqdonut> I haven't even tried shadow-cljs yet...

[18:55:31] <wink> opqdonut: if there are things missing in leiningen, the bug tracker is just a click away :) I don't know why, but for being so widespread there's not a lot of engagement of people asking (and implementing) features

[19:01:35] <technomancy> honestly most of the improvements we haven't done are things we've held off on because they would break other peoples stuff
[19:02:21] <wink> I mean I personally never found boot appealing, but I often see the deps.edn stuff mentioned positively

[21:41:03] <wink> slack has some real features though. edge cases maybe, but every time someone posts a youtube link (in a music channel) I don't have to click. Yes, bots with previews exist (also some weird clients) but not all is bad

[21:41:57] <technomancy> it definitely has a lot of features

[21:42:52] <technomancy> it's extremely funny tbh

[21:49:22] <technomancy> does the channel switcher load fast too?
[21:49:33] <technomancy> that one is sometimes as much as 15 seconds for me
[21:50:06] <technomancy> and then the nick completer will frequently suggest nicks which do not even contain the letters I've typed
