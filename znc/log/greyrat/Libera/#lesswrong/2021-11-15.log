[00:00:04] <Gurkenglas> EY tells the reader that they cannot double-think, because they've read the sequences. He isn't technically lying to a reader that believes him, but he is imposing his will in a manner that should be the reader's choice.
[00:00:47] <pompolic> oh yeah, i see what you mean
[00:01:24] <PapuaHardyNet> mst: how about using paper to write out a prior belief, then rationalizing until you believe you were wrong previously, and then rereading your prior belief statement during a specific time to "reload" that version of you in memory?
[00:01:49] <PapuaHardyNet> kind of like what the protagonist of qntm's antimemetics series did hahahah
[00:01:50] <pompolic> although, i consider a point in favor of EY's view that people make up all these elaborate copes for untenable beliefs meeting with reality
[00:02:26] <pompolic> for example when someone self servingly believes they are best at video game and then start blaming lag etc
[00:02:30] <mst> I would expect that not to work since I don't think 'consciously rationalising' exists - if that can change your belief at all then in that case it's purely a case of 'changing your mind'
[00:02:44] <Gurkenglas> Naively it sure looks to do more harm than good in this circumstance. He's still effectively hacking the reader, and we're supposed to be using tools asymmetrically shaped towards truth.
[00:02:49] <Gurkenglas> *more good than harm
[00:02:55] <pompolic> any statement todd rogers makes about the programmatically-impossible Dragster record
[00:03:01] <pompolic> right
[00:03:14] <pompolic> i think double-think is possible if it leverages reflective instability
[00:03:24] <pompolic> i think that's the term nate soares used somewhere on the blog
[00:03:43] <pompolic> "being reflectively unstable" maybe
[00:04:02] <pompolic> ie when you introspect and the result of your introspection is path-dependent

[00:04:34] <PapuaHardyNet> gurkenglas: I now get what you were trying to imply. yeah, yud was being sneaky.
[00:05:11] <PapuaHardyNet> if only I was reflectively unstable, I would be happy :<
[00:05:26] <Gurkenglas> You can be reflectively unstable if you believe in yourself!
[00:05:57] <PapuaHardyNet> if you believe in me, then perhaps I can achieve it
[00:06:10] <mst> most ratiaonalisation seems to be fairly equivalent to misweighting evidence so that it appears to support your preferred conclusion
[00:06:35] <dv^_^> https://news.yahoo.com/chinese-woman-convicted-trespassing-trump-190000261.html
[00:06:36] <Robomot> Chinese woman convicted of trespassing at Trump’s club deported to China over weekend (A Chinese businesswoman who was held in immigration custody for two years after serving her eight-month prison sentence for trespassing at former President Donald Trump’s exclusive Palm Beach club, Mar-a-Lago, was deported over the weekend and arrived in China on Sunday, according to federal authorities.)
[00:06:46] <PapuaHardyNet> mst: that, in fact, is what underlies Kaj Sotala's method of maintaining your self-concept
[00:07:57] <pompolic> the problem i see with leveraging reflective un-stability
[00:08:01] <PapuaHardyNet> except you don't misweigh evidence as much as you, say, remind yourself of all the examples of times you acted according to the virtuous quality that you evaluate yourself for, that you forgot
[00:09:15] <pompolic> suppose, that the belief-query returns A or B depending on whether you're in mental configuration "A-path" or "B-path"
[00:09:45] <pompolic> something like, one configuration leading to a path that ultimately results in A
[00:10:36] <pompolic> and the situation requires that you believe A
[00:10:48] <pompolic> i think you end up locking yourself out of the B-path entirely!
[00:11:04] <pompolic> and maybe something on the B-path is something you actually need to function!
[00:11:06] <pompolic> v. bad
[00:12:49] <pompolic> and i think if you build identity-critical beliefs on reflectively-unstable things that's just a ticket to having an identity disorder
[00:13:09] <pompolic> DID or whatever the kids say these days
[00:13:11] <PapuaHardyNet> tons of people have identity-critical beliefs on reflectively-unstable things
[00:13:32] <pompolic> yes.png
[00:13:44] <PapuaHardyNet> not that I'm saying that is a good thing, and I do agree with you, but I don't think my identity is built on reflectively-stable concepts either

[00:14:19] <PapuaHardyNet> you know what, there really needs to be more precision, clarity, and standardization when it comes to identity-critical beliefs / self-concept modelling
[00:14:26] <PapuaHardyNet> it would help a lot when it comes to debugging it
[00:14:54] <pompolic> hmm
[00:15:19] <PapuaHardyNet> afk (hopefully)
[00:15:22] <Gurkenglas> I expect brains are hackable in the sense that an AGI could find a path that'll break any one of us. To be fair, maybe there is a nice subspace of paths along which humans aren't hackable.
[00:15:49] <Gurkenglas> uh, that didn't quite come out right
[00:15:58] <pompolic> adversarial identity (woe betide those who simulate it)
[00:16:04] <Gurkenglas> Maybe there is a nice subspace of paths that exclude the exotic sort that takes AGI to find.
[00:16:18] <Gurkenglas> and then some but not all humans are hackable in that.
[00:17:23] <pompolic> that would be nice
[00:17:32] <pompolic> although
[00:17:46] <pompolic> your social graph, i think, exerts considerable authorial power over your identity anyway
[00:18:18] <pompolic> ...i think this was pretty much the problem i threw everything at when i was younger
[00:18:44] <pompolic> that is to say i really didn't want my environment to rewrite my identity according to their values (which were not my values and i hated them)
[00:18:56] <Gurkenglas> a straightforward family of path subspaces for Alice is: For every Bob, the paths that Bob could think up to try and hack Alice.
[00:20:43] <pompolic> aye
[00:21:35] <pompolic> although i think a problem with that is _people knowing things about you_ becomes an existential threat
[00:22:34] <Gurkenglas> By identity you mean the subset of past/future selves that you cooperate with for game-theoretic reasons?
[00:22:37] <gwern> dv^_^: hm, she languished in jail for 3 years? then I guess she really wasn't working for the ccp
[00:23:40] <pompolic> Gurkenglas: i mean something like "self-image" or "what you know yourself to be"
[00:25:27] <pompolic> either way, "Bob could think up to try and hack Alice", i think if you try to minimize that, you need to deny information to ridiculous extents
[00:25:32] <pompolic> hence my line about existential threat
[00:25:33] <Gurkenglas> I like to think of self-preservation as instrumental when you expand out all the heuristics, so whether you don't want your identity to be changed should all else equal depend on what you become
[00:25:36] <gwern> linear: fwiw I'm not sure it was *trained* using TADNE. I read that as simply 'this grid of illustrative samples was done using samples from TADNE'

[00:26:22] <pompolic> i didn't want to become a supplicant for narcissists and authoritarians
[00:26:24] <pompolic> so
[00:26:35] <Gurkenglas> (re my earlier question about interpretability benchmark: it appears InceptionV1 is what people use for that)
[00:26:36] <pompolic> i think that's a pretty good reason not to want it be changed
[00:27:19] <linear> gwern: oh, hmm, i'll try to check, I did think it was a bit odd
[00:27:43] <pompolic> re: standardization of identiy-critical beliefs / self-concept modelling, i wonder if virtual worlds would be good for this. it's more constrained than the real world

[00:30:47] <linear> reasonable
[00:31:44] <pompolic> if i put it this way the method sounds more powerful than it is, but i'll try: by having a paracosm, i could establish a baseline self-concept, which means i could diff and unfuck changes resulting from enemy action

[02:43:26] <gwern> two2thehead: yeah, I brought up how we forget very easily things like "that time a democrat tried to murder 10-20 republican congressmen/senators" or "that time some puerto ricans brought guns into the Congress visitor gallery and started trying to gun them all down" and my mom brought up "that time that texas high school exploded when the chemistry lab or something screwed up and everyone in...
[02:43:33] <gwern> ...the school died". actually, turns out to be even weirder than that
[02:44:37] <gwern> (this was in the context of how you're no longer allowed to go up into the statue of liberty's torch)

[02:53:19] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: this essay seems a bit half-baked. I'm not entirely sure if the point here is to criticize Apple or show examples of a design pattern, and the presented examples also seem somewhat exotic. I'm not left with the impression that this is vitally "basic and fundamental", but more like it's usually a fancy feature for powerusers. most people just list files in the default view...
[02:53:25] <gwern> ...and are fine. how many people are flipping between their regular MS Word draft and the Print Preview, much less CSVs displayed 3 or 4 different ways? this would be a little more compelling if you were showcasing like, how even the first Smalltalk desktop environment built in toggling between outline and print mode or something, or a unix/dos example (maybe ls/dir vs two-pane file browsers...
[02:53:31] <gwern> ...like norton commander?)

[03:40:07] * Obormot\Arcturus shrug
[03:40:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's like one aside
[03:40:48] <gwern> and by starting with apple, it makes one wonder if you're criticizing contemporary apple in some way I lack context for (maybe these were removed in recent mac osxses? does ios even support any of this?)
[03:41:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> iOS doesn't have a file manager at all
[03:41:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> So, uh... no
[03:41:08] <gwern> (and if ios doesn't, is it really 'basic and fundamental'?)
[03:41:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes
[03:41:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> What I'm criticizing is more like "contemporary everything"

[03:41:49] <two2thehead> nice to see the BBC has a sense of humor
[03:42:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> Wanting a broader set of examples is a legit point though

[04:30:54] <kuudes> oh
[04:31:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah this is not relevant to anything really
[04:31:33] <kuudes> I mean, it is sort of a smoking gun that they really wanted to overturn the election results?

[04:32:49] <gwern> I thought we already knew that was the strategy behind getting pence to not certify the vote?

[04:33:50] <kuudes> I mean, to me it seems like an issue about common knowledge

[04:35:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: What you have to understand is that nobody except people addicted to political outrage care about any of this

[04:36:19] <Betawolf> yeah, what gwern said, I don't recall it being a secret that trump thought the election had been stolen and was looking for procedural ways to invalidate it
[04:36:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> But yes

[04:50:57] <feep> trump's delusions are simply not relevant to this.
[04:51:03] <kuudes> feep, you are mistaken
[04:51:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Also, I'm pretty sure if you ask, like, literally any Russian whatsoever if they'd rather keep Putin or go back to Yeltsin, they'll pick Putin without even blinking)

[04:56:56] <kuudes> not just tiny mob. indeed pence was required to cooperate
[04:56:56] <feep> like, holy shit, imagine the mob of counterprotesters if they actually tried that
[04:57:02] <kuudes> that would not matter
[04:57:12] <feep> they'd have to call in the military to stop them, and the military would fucking defect.
[04:57:15] <feep> it'd literally be their oath to.
[04:57:18] <kuudes> no
[04:57:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah the idea that that mob could've actually in any even remotely meaningful way "taken over the government"
[04:57:25] <kuudes> constitution would say trump is the president
[04:57:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> Is 100% delusional
[04:57:28] <Betawolf> kuudes: Something like Trump or his associates discussing how they intend for the mob to get violent or something that obviously means that, as part of their plan. 
[04:57:32] <kuudes> no, the mob was instrument
[04:57:34] <kuudes> not cause
[04:57:38] <feep> kuudes: you are ..... *seriously* overweighting the procedural and underweighting the perceptual.
[04:57:43] <feep> it's a thing with you.
[04:57:52] <kuudes> the oath is for constitution
[04:57:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: You're still in the Finnish mentality where things written on pieces of paper have material consequences in the real world
[04:57:59] <kuudes> this is why they didn't just remove the nuke button
[04:58:07] <adiabatic> I second feep's analysis of your biases
[04:58:13] <kuudes> but instead planned complicated "and then we all resign one by one"
[04:58:27] <feep> trump got the mob he got on some *very* thin claims that biden stole the election
[04:58:41] <kuudes> and this is why the military specifically banned any military presence on capitol
[04:58:49] <feep> if trump *actually* stole the election, that mob would ... like, as I said, it wouldn't even be a civil war, because a war requires two sides
[04:58:53] <kuudes> because they were afraid someone of themselves would defect for trump
[04:59:04] <kuudes> you are imo in illusion

[04:59:26] <feep> like, there's a thing of boiling a frog
[04:59:36] <kuudes> Obormot\Arcturus, would you go to protest if trump was elected that way?
[04:59:37] <feep> and then there's a thing of running at a frog with a knife while loudly yelling
[04:59:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: I don't protest anything under any circumstances
[04:59:53] <kuudes> indeed
[04:59:56] <kuudes> adiabatic, would you?
[05:00:19] <kuudes> gwern, would you?
[05:00:29] <adiabatic> kuudes: "would I protest if" the answer is always no. I'm not a stand around and hold a sign guy
[05:00:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> Boy you sure pick some examples
[05:00:36] <kuudes> which one of you would do as feep presumes and put your life on line against trump

[05:00:50] <feep> adiabatic: this would be several levels beyond "stand around and hold signs"
[05:00:55] <bildramer> obviously the smart people in this channel wouldn't risk facing violence for no gain when hundreds of thousands of other slightly insane people will do it
[05:01:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: We're pretty much the most "passivist" people even *in this channel*, forget "in America"
[05:01:21] <kuudes> yes but dems are not the people who plan to shoot other people with machine guns
[05:01:22] <feep> adiabatic: like, the level of failure described here comes to the point where the people would have to come together and recreate the government
[05:01:30] <kuudes> Obormot\Arcturus, my point is that no, you are not that much
[05:01:40] <kuudes> as feep pointed out, *he* would go to face guns
[05:01:58] <kuudes> and this is not just a difference between persons but between peoples
[05:02:00] <feep> to be fair, if I didn't, I'd basically not have paid any attention in history class
[05:02:12] <kuudes> "<Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: What you have to understand is that nobody except people addicted to political outrage care about any of this"
[05:02:19] <feep> I actually stand by that.
[05:02:34] <kuudes> feep, I present that Obormot\Arcturus's opinion there is a more general take on this matter
[05:02:34] <feep> Rather, it's *because* I predict that sort of reaction that I think trump's words are irrelevant.
[05:02:41] <feep> there is no world where he could have executed on this.
[05:02:52] <kuudes> ie even if trump succeeded, this similar spirit would prevail
[05:02:55] <kuudes> "its just politics"
[05:02:59] <kuudes> "its always like this"
[05:03:04] <feep> my claim is: this spirit prevails *because he could never have succeeded*.-
[05:03:10] <kuudes> "politicians are just evil and stupid as usual"
[05:03:25] <kuudes> feep, that he could not have succeeded is not true
[05:03:27] <feep> the not succeeding is priced in.
[05:03:38] <kuudes> the constitution specifically outline the procedure they were aiming at
[05:03:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep's got it exactly right
[05:03:51] <Urchin[emacs]> trump was more evil and stupid than usual
[05:03:53] <feep> kuudes: look. trump, the president of fascism, the face of white supremacism in the white house
[05:03:57] <feep> 1. ran on building a big wall
[05:03:59] <feep> 2. failed to build the wall.
[05:04:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> Urchin[emacs]: No no. *Less* evil, more stupid.
[05:04:13] <adiabatic> ^^^^^^^^
[05:04:16] <kuudes> he succeeded getting elected
[05:04:37] <feep> yes, but that's an example of democracy *working*, not being subverted.
[05:04:47] <adiabatic> kuudes: and then he failed to do anything the average GOP slime mold would do (basically nothing except some tax changes)
[05:04:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> Urchin[emacs]: You've heard the old joke about this, right?
[05:04:59] <mst> if trump's ridiculous tantrums about losing the election hadn't failed the way they did fail, they would've failed some other way, almost certainly
[05:05:05] <mst> adiabatic: that was Paul Ryan anyway
[05:05:09] <kuudes> if they had managed to get this one thing dropped, then indeed democracy would have succeeded to re-elect trump
[05:05:14] <Urchin[emacs]> feep: the whole justification for representative democracy was to keep people like Caligula, Nero and Trump away from power
[05:05:15] <adiabatic> mst: right.
[05:05:18] <mst> kuudes: no
[05:05:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah, as mst said. Success was never an option
[05:05:33] <feep> Urchin[emacs]: no, the point is to avoid succession crises and nerf power in general
[05:05:34] <Urchin[emacs]> Obormot\Arcturus: what joke?
[05:05:35] <mst> kuudes: he'd've needed a -lot- of nat 20s in a row, the risk was pretty minimal
[05:05:50] <kuudes> mst, I understand your point, but I disagree with it
[05:06:02] <mst> it was fucking ridonkulous but the odds of success were ... maybe not 'never an option', but exceedingly low
[05:06:06] <Urchin[emacs]> feep: not exactly, the quality of rulers was heavily considered
[05:06:13] <adiabatic> mst: natural 20s are when you roll 20s with your own hand, as opposed to Taking 20™, right?
[05:06:13] <kuudes> there were a couple of more rolls after pence, but pence roll imo didn't require nat 20
[05:06:37] <kuudes> pence could imo have been a person who would have obeyed trump. he did that already before
[05:06:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> Urchin[emacs]: It goes like this: a Soviet diplomat (*very* old joke, as you see) is visiting Washington, and he's being given the grand tour by a Republic politician, a congressman or something. And the Republican is explaining to the Russian how the American political system works:
[05:06:39] <feep> adiabatic: right
[05:06:43] <adiabatic> feep: ty
[05:06:44] <mst> adiabatic: it's 'taking 10' rather than rolling a d20 IIRC
[05:06:49] <feep> adiabatic: well, artificial 20 is when you hit 20 with bonuses
[05:06:52] <kuudes> basicly pence disobeying was sort of "deep state submarine"
[05:06:56] <feep> nat 20 is when you roll 20 on the dice
[05:07:15] <adiabatic> mst: there's a lot of Taking 20 in Neverwinter Nights, usually when you're unlocking a chest or a door and there's nothing around to bug you
[05:07:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> Urchin[emacs]: "In this country," he says, "we have two political parties: the stupid party, and the evil party. And I, sir," says the Republic, "am proud to be a member of the stupid party!"
[05:07:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> *Republican
[05:07:53] <kuudes> if instead of pence trump would have got, say, cruz as vice president, it seems to me vp would have held his planned position
[05:08:08] <mst> adiabatic: I'm more familiar with the tabletop stuff, I can see 'if you have as long as you like, the game awards you an automatic artifical 20' being a reasonable mechanic but I've never heard of it before
[05:08:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: That *is* tabletop stuff
[05:08:22] <kuudes> and then it would have been dems battling procedure against rep trumpists there
[05:08:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: That's right out of the 3e PHB
[05:08:34] <kuudes> which is not >50% for trumpists, but is >10%

[05:09:00] <kuudes> but if trumpists had won that battle, ie what states are counted, then they would have won >85%

[05:09:07] <adiabatic> I've _read_ about Taking 10™ for other things, but Taking 10 seemed like a tabletop-only thing
[05:09:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ah, you got it already
[05:09:23] <adiabatic> also NWN is, roughly, 3¼e
[05:09:27] <feep> kuudes: my take is: the capitol riots happened on
[05:09:34] <feep> *really really thin and bad* evidence of election theft
[05:09:40] <kuudes> I agree on that
[05:09:46] <kuudes> there was no election theft
[05:09:48] <feep> it's 2021, there's no way to claim that the left can't riot with the best of them
[05:09:57] <feep> the point is, if trump *actually did an election theft*
[05:10:04] <adiabatic> all the good riots are left-wing so far
[05:10:11] <kuudes> the riot didn't matter but to the case of getting the specific states thrown out
[05:10:12] <mst> I've genuinely not encountered 'taking 20' before and frankly I'm not sure it's a mechanic I entirely like because if you want a 20 you should allow for the chance of a 1 causing something hilarious to happen
[05:10:19] <kuudes> the riots point was to drive some dems to bunkers
[05:10:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: I mean, there probably was, but no more than usual, which is *like* what you're saying...
[05:10:26] <feep> kuudes: my point is, imagine the thing the riot tried to achieve
[05:10:31] <feep> but with ten or twenty times the people
[05:10:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: No, read what I linked
[05:10:34] <kuudes> so that trumpist reps got majority in procedure voting, if pence put such forth
[05:10:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: ... or what you linked, for that matter
[05:10:47] <adiabatic> mst: how can can something hilarious happen when you're trying to open a locked door, though?
[05:10:50] <mst> only applicable given "Since taking 20 assumes that your character will fail many times before succeeding, your character would automatically incur any penalties for failure before he or she could complete the task (hence why it is generally not allowed with Skills that carry such penalties)"
[05:10:56] <mst> yeah, ok
[05:10:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> Right
[05:11:11] <kuudes> feep, riots on any other day but 1/6 don't matter similarly
[05:11:25] <feep> kuudes: the government exists by the consent of the governed.
[05:11:27] <bildramer> if a bunch of courts say something the vast majority of people strongly disagree with, so much the worse for the courts
[05:11:30] <mst> adiabatic: break your lockpick while terminally damaging the lock, of course
[05:11:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: Basically, it's just a way to compress literally sitting there going "I try again. I try again. I try again..."
[05:11:37] <kuudes> feep, in usa, it seems to me that is a possibly false presumption
[05:11:40] <feep> nope.
[05:11:52] <adiabatic> mst: maybe the vidya game wanted to be nice, then
[05:11:52] <mst> Obormot\Arcturus: yep, I see why the mechanic is useful in some cases
[05:11:52] <kuudes> bildramer, it is not a vast majority
[05:12:10] <kuudes> 20% is enough for lukashenka to sustain ruling
[05:12:14] <mst> adiabatic: also honestly that sort of thing requires a real DM to make the failures amusing rather than game breaking
[05:12:29] <feep> if ... 10% of the country want to abolish the government
[05:12:37] <feep> like, genuinely want to, to the extent of executing on it
[05:12:41] <feep> then the government will fall.
[05:12:52] <kuudes> feep, in belarus it seems not-lukashenka got 80% of votes
[05:13:04] <feep> almost nobody ever wants this.
[05:13:23] <feep> but like, that's the power of democracy.
[05:13:35] <kuudes> in turkey clearly >10% of people wanted erdogan gone
[05:13:48] <kuudes> they had a military with f16s shooting missiles at erdogan
[05:14:05] <feep> I don't have a good way to gauge this
[05:14:09] <bildramer> I think the majority is kind of important
[05:14:19] <feep> like, the degree to which the turkish putsch was actually succeedable
[05:14:24] <feep> anyway there's a difference between "would prefer" and "are executing on"
[05:14:30] <kuudes> there got a 5 store high hole in a hotel in the room erdogan was in 1 h ago
[05:14:41] <kuudes> I don't know if it was amraam or what
[05:15:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: Have I linked you my favorite example of "make the failures interesting"?
[05:15:06] <feep> anyway, I think the problem there was specifically that there wasn't that 10% civil core of support
[05:15:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> (the Tampering With Mortality table)
[05:15:20] <kuudes> in turkey?
[05:15:22] <feep> yeah
[05:15:29] <bildramer> most people I'd say reluctantly accept that sometimes their enemies will win, and that society lets that happen because it's fair-ish
[05:15:54] <kuudes> bildramer, majority of people voted against bush, trump
[05:15:58] <bildramer> if it's obviously nonfair to a sufficiently high degree, they stop accepting it
[05:16:00] <feep> kuudes: irrelevant!
[05:16:08] <mst> Obormot\Arcturus: probably but go for it?
[05:16:16] <feep> simply not relevant to the topic.
[05:16:31] <feep> there is no special power to the concept of a numerical majority.
[05:16:33] <kuudes> feep, bildramer was pleading for majority of people against courts
[05:16:52] <feep> kuudes: well, I disagree that it's relevant for america
[05:17:05] <kuudes> a large part of voters wanted trump to win
[05:17:06] <feep> or that it even matters, I don't think you need a majority, I think you need a hardcore minority
[05:17:09] <kuudes> much larger than 10%
[05:17:43] <bildramer> feep: think about the media putting their thumb on the scale
[05:17:43] <feep> yes, again, there's a difference between having a preference and having sufficiently high contrast that you go all in on supporting that preference
[05:17:50] <kuudes> "Betawolf> kuudes: Something like Trump or his associates discussing how they intend for the mob to get violent or something that obviously means that, as part of their plan." Betawolf, thanks, you actually answered. have some rationality points!
[05:18:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: So this is from the Adventurer Conqueror King System (ACKS), one of the "OSR" systems. The idea is: you don't want there to be no consequences for death (i.e. basically trivially accessible resurrection magic), because that cheapens the narrative significance of death, etc., etc. BUT you don't want death/resurrection to do things like "you lose a level" or "you lose [some amount of XP]", because that feels punishing and
[05:18:17] <Obormot\Arcturus>  frustrating - like a bunch of progress you made was for nothing. So, ACKS takes a different approach...
[05:18:47] <kuudes> it has seemed to me there have indeed been moving goalposts on this matter, and I thought this article settled most of the questions I saw as open by reasonable people
[05:19:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: I shamelessly stole this idea and slightly tweaked it for the system I am building, which also means it's available in handy web form - and thus: https://woa.obormot.net/ResurrectionMagic
[05:19:04] <Robomot> Worlds of Adventure | Main / ResurrectionMagic
[05:19:04] <feep> kuudes: my take has never been that trump did not want to start an insurrection.

[05:19:29] <feep> right, just to explain why the article left me disinterested.
[05:19:41] <feep> scott highlighted this all the way back in 2016
[05:19:49] <kuudes> oh?
[05:19:55] <feep> in you are still crying wolf
[05:20:23] <feep> > When a guy who says outright that he won’t respect elections unless he wins them does, somehow, win an election, the headlines are how he once said he didn’t like globalists which means he must be anti-Semitic.
[05:20:38] *** Joins: feepbot (~feepbot@ppp-93-104-168-36.dynamic.mnet-online.de)
[05:20:48] <feep> reading that magazine is a good way to remember why we don't listen to the media about trump ever.
[05:20:50] <feep> that article*
[05:20:53] <Betawolf> kuudes: I don't understand what you see as the key issue of the capitol riots, or what this source revealed to you. I thought it was well-known that Trump asked Pence to take actions he dubiously had the power to take, the debate as I saw it was whether Trump intended to use force to hold power, and I've not seen any evidence for that and IIRC neither has the FBI.
[05:21:19] <kuudes> Betawolf, yeah, it didn't update much for me. I thought it would update for other people
[05:21:34] <kuudes> force?
[05:21:37] <kuudes> what do you mean?
[05:22:04] <mst> Obormot\Arcturus: aha, I'm reminded of a campaign I ran that was more investigative and combat was meant to be something you'd try to avoid
[05:22:16] <mst> Obormot\Arcturus: one of my players tried to play it as a james bond action scene
[05:22:16] <Betawolf> violence, mobs holding congress hostage, military coup, etc.
[05:22:47] <mst> Obormot\Arcturus: rather than killing his character, I fudged the hit location rolls and both his legs suffered a significant amount of iron poisoning
[05:22:53] <kuudes> I don't think there was aim to kill anyone or imprison anyone
[05:23:03] <kuudes> it was enough if they fled from the decision making meeting
[05:23:25] <mst> Obormot\Arcturus: he spent the next N sessions with his would-be hard man character -having- to engage in the investigative side because he was on crutches ;)
[05:23:36] <kuudes> I guess I am uncertain if this was illegal or unconstitutional tampering with the election results in usa
[05:23:45] <Betawolf> kuudes: please notice that you're talking about a _result_ and not that someone _planned_ that result.
[05:23:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: Hah, nice
[05:24:07] <kuudes> Betawolf, hmm, please clarify?
[05:24:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: That's a good example. I think of this sort of thing as "rather than revert progress, instead progress on a new and exciting orthogonal dimension"
[05:24:57] <mst> Obormot\Arcturus: way more effective than killing the character and having him replace it, instead he had to suffer in game for that stupidity ... and the next firefight that character was in, he played rather more wisely
[05:25:28] <mst> note, the rest of the party had got this in the first place
[05:25:36] <mst> and were ambushing the enemy from carefully chosen cover
[05:26:03] <mst> fuckwit boy ran out from behind said cover firing a pair of pistols
[05:26:21] <mst> by all rights, his character -should- have been shot dead
[05:26:30] <mst> but what I did instead was both kinder and more humiliating ;)
[05:27:29] <Betawolf> kuudes: 'a bad thing happened' doesn't mean someone intended for it to happen, right? That's important for ascribing fault. Relatedly, you seemed earlier to be taking 'Trump had a legal strategy for dubious procedural manoeuvres to "win" the election' as evidence in support of (what I thought was the claim) 'Trump planned for his mob of supporters to storm Congress'.
[05:28:07] <adiabatic> Obormot\Arcturus: the locations of must-meat and can't-meat things are interesting. if I were some barbarian I'd probably rather have the must-meat antiperk than the can't-meat
[05:28:50] <kuudes> Betawolf, yes. but isn't that established that trump and others riled up the mob for some hour or so and indeed guided it toward the congress?
[05:29:11] <kuudes> the open question has imo been on if this had anything that could have caused trump to retain presidency
[05:29:40] <kuudes> and it seems to me rather clear they were planning to go as logos described
[05:30:24] <feep> it does, I just think that could not have caused trump to retain presidency
[05:30:25] <kuudes> and indeed to follow the constitution and the law on declaring the results
[05:30:31] <Betawolf> Oh, so you were actually interested in 'could it have worked?' I'm not sure the legal strategy is conclusive evidence for that, but I do see how it's more relevant.
[05:31:12] <kuudes> Betawolf, to me the key thing is if or not trump and pals planned to affect the next president in plausible way
[05:31:44] <kuudes> because that seems to me the key question on if was an attempted insurgency or what is the word
[05:31:46] <kuudes> treason
[05:32:09] <feep> oh no it was definitely treason
[05:32:13] <kuudes> I agree on that random people causing random violence is just random people causing random violence
[05:32:21] <feep> I jsut think it was such weak treason that nobody cares to prosecute it
[05:32:41] <kuudes> that is the thing I feel this is against
[05:32:55] <kuudes> ie indeed psychotic, out of reality plan would be just lunacy
[05:33:03] <kuudes> but imo this was not out of reality
[05:33:08] <feep> That's the disagreement, yeah.
[05:33:33] <kuudes> they had a reasonable plan to get trump certified as the president for the term 2020-2024
[05:33:40] <kuudes> 2021-2024?
[05:33:51] <Betawolf> Trump had a _lot_ of bad lawsuits underway at exactly this point in time.
[05:33:54] <feep> they had a reasonable plan in legal terms assuming some difficult diplo checks.
[05:33:56] <adiabatic> 2020–2024.
[05:34:02] <Betawolf> I don't think he had the best legal advice.
[05:34:03] <feep> they just had no *practically* viable plan.
[05:34:22] <kuudes> it seems to me that it was 2 rolls away of succeeding
[05:34:29] <feep> no.
[05:34:45] <feep> look, there's a great sentence in that one askxkcd about ... hang on
[05:34:49] <kuudes> 1st was pence cooperating, they seemed to have enough trumpists present that they would have got majority in case other people fled
[05:35:07] <feep> I can't find it
[05:35:08] <kuudes> then the next was to get trump elected on the constitution specified state delegation thingy
[05:35:20] <feep> it was something like, if you're in the path of a supernova or something
[05:35:26] <mst> kuudes: my belief is that is was more than two rolls away from -nominally- succeeding
[05:35:32] <mst> and then all hell would've broken loose
[05:35:36] <feep> ^
[05:35:40] <kuudes> and for 1 it seems to me that indeed if we had counterfactual cruz instead of pence, it could have went through with at least 50%
[05:35:50] <feep> and it was "You'd die, obviously. You wouldn't exactly die of *anything* specific. You would just stop being biology and start being physics."
[05:35:52] <kuudes> mst, well, that is what I disagree with
[05:36:07] <feep> IMO, if Trump tried this, he would stop being legality and start being power.
[05:36:17] <kuudes> because the military seems that they would have sustained the constitutionally elected president
[05:36:21] <mst> kuudes: it's rare that I find myself disagreeing with somebody because they're *underestimating* america, but here we are
[05:36:43] <kuudes> which dems would have shot some people dead if this happened? namespace?
[05:36:46] <feep> legalese is a superstructure built *on top* of power dynamics.
[05:37:12] <kuudes> because otherwise dems just would have got to the courts, and it would have been as bad as now with courts about judging trump for treason
[05:37:20] <feep> if this was attempted, IMO it would clearly break the legalese-legitimacy coupling
[05:37:24] <kuudes> and the default would have been that trump would have been within oval offica
[05:37:27] <kuudes> *office
[05:37:54] <kuudes> feep, who of dems would have used a gun to kill another person in response of this outcome?
[05:38:05] <feep> thousands, probably
[05:38:17] <kuudes> blm has not used guns, or has it?
[05:38:24] <feep> keeping in mind that the capitol riots had ... six
[05:38:44] <feep> kuudes: blm is still built on the controversy frontier
[05:38:46] <Betawolf> kuudes: a few shootings, not many.
[05:38:49] <kuudes> I strongly feel against democratic aligned armed rebellion
[05:38:54] <kuudes> Betawolf, indeed, maybe
[05:38:55] <feep> this would be stupidly far beyond the frontier
[05:39:16] <mst> kuudes: in the case of an actual trump coup, I would've expected the John Brown Gun Club and Redneck Revolt to have something to say about it
[05:39:18] <kuudes> feep, I feel the americans are not that firebrands
[05:39:29] * feep shrugs
[05:39:37] <mst> though realistically I'd've expected the blue states to have something to say about it waaaay earlier
[05:39:38] <feep> not much else to argue here.
[05:39:41] <PlanckWalk> 99% not being firebrands means that there are only 3 million firebrands.
[05:40:05] <kuudes> which politicians have dems assassinated in the past?
[05:40:17] <feep> the whole point of politics is to create the perception of legitimacy
[05:40:46] <feep> when trump managed to *vaguely impugn* that perception, the capitol riots happened.
[05:40:47] <kuudes> rep-aligned seem to have got jfk, mlk, other kennedys at least, then some trade unionists or something iirc

[05:43:06] <kuudes> Betawolf, how many gop people did they murder?
[05:43:14] <kuudes> it seems hard to find from that wiki page
[05:43:34] <PlanckWalk> I"m not sure when the Dem/Rep swap happened, or whether you'd count that as affecting which party you should count them as.
[05:44:04] <PlanckWalk> But either way there are quite a few Republicans killed in there
[05:44:06] <Betawolf> they seem to kill more cops than politicians, but they did bomb the capitol building (no casualties)
[05:45:23] <kuudes> PlanckWalk, it seems on 1910s onward there are about no republican killed for political reason in that list
[05:45:49] <kuudes> there is at least 1 burglary and 2 insanish persons or something, and their targets were apparent randos
[05:46:07] <kuudes> Betawolf, yes. the "no casualties" seems important to me
[05:46:29] <gwern> (had the baseball game gone a little differently, that number would look quite different)
[05:46:33] <kuudes> gwern, yes
[05:46:50] <kuudes> is there a conspiracy theory that some org sent him?
[05:47:17] <gwern> no, I'm pointing out the role of chance in rare events like notable assassinations
[05:47:19] <kuudes> you know the theories that fbi or cia caused assassinations of jfk, mlk and bob kennedy
[05:47:36] <gwern> reagan could've very easily died too
[05:47:44] <kuudes> he could have indeed
[05:48:25] <kuudes> my point is not that dems are saints, my point is that they don't seem to have in their spine to die and kill for their ideal
[05:48:37] <kuudes> blakc panthers maybe
[05:49:14] <PlanckWalk> I think you're overgeneralizing across 150 million people.
[05:49:33] <kuudes> gwern, do you presume that if trump won by such a technical procedure (which has been used in the past), there would have been a meaningful armed civil war or rebellion as feep referred to?
[05:49:49] <PlanckWalk> And applying that overbroad brush to a completely different scenario on top of that.
[05:49:58] <kuudes> PlanckWalk, there was no such rebellion for gore
[05:50:19] <PlanckWalk> Gore simply lost
[05:50:21] <kuudes> it seems to me that this would have been similar sort of technicality, but perhaps aside the "tourists"
[05:50:39] <kuudes> PlanckWalk, gore lost as supreme court ruled so
[05:51:25] <kuudes> but gwern, how do you see it? is it like feep presumes?
[05:51:26] <gwern> no. if pence had successfully gone through with it and the flipping it to the senate for a repub vote actually happened and the rep senators stared into the abyss and decided they really did want to re-enthrone a man who would despise them even more for doing so than he already did and they despised him, I expect that there would have been endless grinding legal warfare where the trump...
[05:51:32] <gwern> ...administration began a second term that would, somehow, have been even less effective and meaningful than the first
[05:51:48] <kuudes> yes, I agree on that
[05:51:58] <kuudes> but feep proposes there would have been armed rebellion or similar
[05:52:08] <kuudes> I agree the trump second term would have been weak
[05:52:15] <kuudes> but it would have been a trump second term
[05:52:19] <gwern> and by the time it was basically done after 3 years, no one would much care because they would rationally decide that contending the next election would be way saner than some sort of civil war
[05:52:29] <kuudes> indeed.
[05:52:36] <kuudes> I agree with you in this
[05:52:38] <gwern> and even trump can't find an excuse for a third term very specifically excluded by the constitution
[05:52:41] <kuudes> yes
[05:53:13] <kuudes> but that take is in complete contradiction to the proposed "it was never possible, and if it was, it would have meant civil war"
[05:53:35] <kuudes> but I agree quite completely with your position there gwern
[05:53:53] <PlanckWalk> I think if the clear Dem win was refused to be certified despite essentially every court saying it was clear, and evidence that Trump intended this to happen, there would be violence
[05:53:55] <kuudes> feep, how do you see gwern's model?
[05:54:23] <kuudes> I don't think every court would have said so, PlanckWalk
[05:54:38] <kuudes> because post fact the procedure would have been hairy to rule illegal
[05:54:40] <gwern> I am pretty sure that it was never feasible because trump is just an incompetent weak narcissist playing angles, and not a napoleon who is relentless in seeking power and canny in using men. but if trump had yet again bumbled asswards into victory, I don't see civil war except in the low-grade sort of feuding we see with coronavirus of the "well you can't make me" way
[05:54:43] <PlanckWalk> It might not get to outright assassinations or civil war or rebellion or whatever, but it would not be just "a weak second term"
[05:55:10] <kuudes> gwern, yes, that seems imo rational take on the matter
[05:55:18] <Betawolf> I think there would be localised riots/protests in some cities for a little while, but probably not even on the scale of the BLM ones.
[05:55:38] <kuudes> I guess I see feasibility on the level "well he managed to win the first time. stuff happens. sometimes you roll 1 on dice"
[05:55:49] <PlanckWalk> kuudes: I mean the courts saying there was nothing wrong with the election results.
[05:55:52] <gwern> Betawolf: I think I could see pretty big protests and counterprotests at the pseudo-inauguration
[05:56:02] <kuudes> PlanckWalk, the law allows the procedure planned.
[05:56:03] <gwern> the inauguration is the schelling point for the 'coup'
[05:56:37] <PlanckWalk> kuudes: People care less about legal technicalities than you think.
[05:56:42] <kuudes> so what
[05:56:48] <kuudes> people don't decide
[05:56:58] <kuudes> unless they carry and shoot guns
[05:57:18] <Betawolf> right, there were Antifa out smashing stuff protesting _Biden_ on inauguration day, so it would have to be worse for Trump.
[05:57:27] <kuudes> sure
[05:57:41] <kuudes> but just riots are not enough
[05:57:48] <Betawolf> sure
[05:58:02] <gwern> they'd be pretty bad, though. you wouldn't want to be in DC that week
[05:58:09] <kuudes> thats true
[05:58:23] <kuudes> and there would be military presence, at least the same as with biden
[05:58:26] <PlanckWalk> Not enough for what?  Riots are plenty enough to get people killed.
[05:58:34] <kuudes> but not to change president
[05:58:55] <PlanckWalk> Right

[05:59:19] <PlanckWalk> That might happen anyway, but separate from riots.
[05:59:22] <kuudes> feep's point was that in case trump got elected, there would be organized rebellion
[05:59:33] <kuudes> because in germany such could be envisioned

[06:00:02] <Robomot> The Murder House
[06:00:03] <kuudes> my point is that americans should now decide if this sort of thing is ok or treason
[06:00:27] <kuudes> and if they decide it is not ok and is treason, they should indeed use their constitution to judge the top people responsible for treason
[06:00:41] <kuudes> with the constitutional effects of them being disqualified from offices evermore
[06:00:57] <kuudes> and they should do this through courts, not through the political decision machine
[06:01:08] <kuudes> ie 14th amendment
[06:01:23] <kuudes> and if they won't, they will get someone to escalate better from this next time
[06:01:32] <kuudes> might take yet another iteration

[07:39:16] <shawwwn> Ah true
[07:39:41] <gwern> oddly, we know that big lies are told constantly, while little lies are each told rarely, so it seems that 'lions' must be rather different kinds of wave-particles than light
[07:39:58] <gwern> because big lies are big but high-frequency, and little ones are low-frequency

[07:44:38] <gwern> shawwwn: no, think about it. little lies are things like "no, that blue dress doesn't make you look fat" or "of course I didn't eat the last donut". but how often do you go dress shopping or have to cover up ill-gotten weightgainz? not frequently. that is, low frequency. whereas as we know from goebbels, big lies must be repeated as often as possible every day, hence, high frequency
[07:45:09] <nshepperd> they say a lie can travel around the world before the truth has its boots on, so the wave packet speed must be quite high
[07:45:10] <gwern> sure, you may engage in little lies every hour, but it'll be a different one each time, while the big lie is usually just one or two specific ones every time
[07:45:12] <shawwwn> Big lies have more mass and hence can’t oscillate as easily
[07:45:32] <shawwwn> You have to commit more to a big lie than a little one
[07:45:35] <gwern> potentially there is an energy dimension
[07:45:59] <adiabatic> I'm reminded about my "last donuts" every time I put on pants without an elastic band
[07:47:19] <nshepperd> that's a lie with mass

[13:10:46] <synthmeat> yeesh
[13:10:48] <synthmeat> yeah
[13:11:10] <PapuaHardyNet> that's pretty bad - you can't go off-grid if you are dependent on the medical system like this
[13:11:34] <PapuaHardyNet> our world is now permanently more fragile.
[13:11:50] <synthmeat> well, off grid you just wouldn't get covid :)
[13:12:03] <kuudes> well the first thing is imo that we should start shooting up those boosters
[13:12:29] <kuudes> and we should be prepared to manufacture and deliver those boosters for until further notice
[13:12:43] <kuudes> we now have the information on what we should do, we should do that while we think of next moves
[13:13:49] <capisce^> the world is indeed permanently more fragile
[13:13:51] <kuudes> ie things like "it isn't any sort of freedom when one has to get a jab twice a year" are not useful. what is useful is to get the next booster jab, preferrably sooner than later
[13:14:18] <kuudes> maybe with some years we can figure out something better. but now we have to take a spoon and eat this stew
[13:14:45] <PapuaHardyNet> right.

[13:15:08] <PapuaHardyNet> although you know you keep evoking totalitarian vibes right
[13:15:47] <kuudes> well, it seems the boosters protect the one who gets them, so I am sort of happy if I and my dear ones get boosters asap
[13:15:53] <kuudes> which currently is not legally permitted
[13:16:21] <kuudes> but I guess there is also the thing that healthcare system crumbling would cause me other inconveniences rather than just getting covid
[13:16:48] <kuudes> I am frustrated that I have to teach people to break the law and hack the system in order to get protected. :-(
[13:17:38] <PapuaHardyNet> don't be, that frustration shows how much you wish legal = correct always
[13:18:40] <PapuaHardyNet> anyway, I get how you feel
[13:20:19] <kuudes> with the antivaxxers I can at least just explain it with personal stupidity, but with preventing willing people to get vaccinated I feel quite confused
[13:20:36] <kuudes> and it is not the politicians or the money
[13:20:47] <kuudes> we already have the stuff, and money has already been drawn
[13:21:12] <kuudes> but for some reason the vaccination experts prevent decision to allow people to get vaccinated more when they want
[13:22:06] <kuudes> and per track record they are not very stupid. so are they evil? O_o what is going on?
[13:22:16] <synthmeat> i don't vote with votes. i vote with my covid risks :)
[13:22:24] <kuudes> hoo
[13:26:05] <synthmeat> that's a lot of antivax motivation, at least over here, and at least what's my impression - anti-gov sentiment
[13:26:48] <synthmeat> that's why i look at studies "see how in advanced countries they vax themselves silly" with some skepticism. if i was finn, i'd probably get vaxxed. and vote as well.
[13:28:29] <PapuaHardyNet> that's right, my antivax tendencies directly stem from my anti-gov sentiments
[13:28:41] <synthmeat> literally everyone i know that didn't get vaxxed is basically summed up as "fuck the system"
[13:29:25] <PapuaHardyNet> hell yea

[13:58:33] <synthmeat> saturn2: that's a good question. i have no straightforward answer. at the base level it's "they want it, they're bad, so i'm not gonna do it". but maybe draining the coffers so there's less opportunity for corruption. or forcing their hand to go to more extreme measures which will provoke protests.
[14:00:18] <synthmeat> corona already kinda has positive effects on health sector over here - they're forced to cut corrupt and administrative expenses

[21:48:17] <PapuaHardyNet> let me clarify - I'm surprised you hold openai in high regard and haven't heard of anthropic or talked about it yet
[21:48:39] <Gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet, what's their agenda? I don't expect it to be ~my agenda, although I suppose the probability is higher given that they spawned there.
[21:48:41] <gwern> anthropic hasn't published much of anything
[21:48:58] <gwern> so unless you're familiar with the people, it's hard to gauge if you'd like them
[21:49:24] <Gurkenglas> Just because EY is right about OpenAI having been lots of harm doesn't mean one shouldn't work with them.
[21:50:06] <Gurkenglas> I probably wouldn't have hit on my agenda without GPT showing natural language mastery does not imply immediate FOOM

[21:51:40] <Gurkenglas> Having read OpenAIs application form, I wouldn't expect them to accept me - I don't have the track record. I should rather talk to their researchers on the similarity between our agendas. That sort of thing sounds empirically like what gets me into places anyway.

[21:53:18] <Gurkenglas> has anthropic said what exactly made them leave openai?

[21:55:34] <Gurkenglas> today's https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xHnuX42WNZ9hq53bz/attempted-gears-analysis-of-agi-intervention-discussion-with-1 says Anthropic in particular doesn’t seem open to alternative research approaches and mostly wants to apply More Dakka

[21:57:46] <Gurkenglas> anthropic being fueled by "higher probability of winning the race" than "higher probability of being anywhere near useful" increases my expectation of silence.
[21:57:54] <ggreer> I'm pretty sure rittenhouse is gonna walk. if you are in a place that riots, prepare
[21:58:06] <ggreer> not even convicted on the weapons charge (which was dismissed)
[21:58:24] <Gurkenglas> on what grounds?
[21:58:38] <ggreer> because in wisconsin, it is legal for a 17 year old to carry a rifle around
[21:58:56] <ggreer> the law was only for minors carrying short barreled rifles and short barreled shotguns
[21:59:14] <Gurkenglas> i wonder how many rioters will think to demonstrate the consequences of this legal situation.
[21:59:57] <PapuaHardyNet> I'm impressed
[22:00:32] <kuudes> satoshi nakamoto is currently about #16 richest person on earth, given assumptions
[22:00:34] <ggreer> it looks like the jury instructions are to ignore lesser counts if they find rittenhouse acted in self defense
[22:01:19] <PapuaHardyNet> ggreer: what the hell were these protests about anyway
[22:01:30] <PapuaHardyNet> it seems like america is protests all the fucking time now
[22:01:34] <Gurkenglas> kuudes, if satoshi started selling now i don't expect he'd realize his riches. like, what will people think? presumably that the genius who invented it found a genius way to break the scheme or something.
[22:01:42] <PapuaHardyNet> s/is/has/
[22:02:16] <shawwwn> s/has/is/
[22:02:21] <shawwwn> no s-backs
[22:02:25] <ggreer> and to dismiss the reckless endangerment charge if they find rittenhouse was legitimately defending himself from rosenbaum
[22:02:31] <gwern> Gurkenglas: he would just do off-market sales in dark pools and swaps for other currencies. the bitcoin market is so large and liquid that satoshi wouldn't have any more meaningful effect than, say, musk selling tesla shares
[22:02:40] <PapuaHardyNet> Gurkenglas: what are you even talking about? satoshi-bitcoin is non fungible and will sell for millions per BTC
[22:02:54] <PapuaHardyNet> if I had the money I'd pay millions per BTC he minted, just to own a piece of history
[22:02:54] <ggreer> (the prosecution charged rittenhouse with reckless endangerment of richard mcginnis because rittenhouse shot rosenbaum near mcginnis)
[22:03:16] <gwern> plus satoshi's coins have a premium in that they are miner coins with zero history, so totally fungible and taint-free
[22:03:45] <PapuaHardyNet> ??? they have been sent from satoshi's wallet, they are definitely different from other minted bitcoins
[22:04:07] <Gurkenglas> gwern, huh, i didn't expect the btc market cap to be high enough for #16 to be compatible with liquid-enough. by taint you mean that like, US could say "this coin has passed through the hands of a criminal, gimme"?
[22:04:15] <gwern> yes
[22:05:19] <PapuaHardyNet> I see, your argument is from the perspective of satoshi actually selling it, where he won't take the risk of selling it marketed as "satoshi minted coin"
[22:06:06] <PapuaHardyNet> or perhaps you don't believe there's a market for satoshi's stash? I mean, NFTs
[22:06:28] <Gurkenglas> Who would he sell to? Presumably the counterpart would know that he is satoshi from which coin he's selling, and draw the appropriate inferences.
[22:06:35] <rmmh> has there been a single peep from satoshi in 5+ years?
[22:06:42] <ggreer> no. it was probably hal finney
[22:06:57] <rmmh> just the pretenders to the crypto-throne not doing the most obvious verification still, then
[22:07:04] <gwern> (it was not hal)
[22:07:17] <Gurkenglas> And the same crash should happen when the buyer sells the satoshicoin for real
[22:08:01] <PapuaHardyNet> you think there will be a crash because you believe that others will believe that satoshi is selling because he knows something others don't
[22:08:11] <PapuaHardyNet> that makes sense, it took me time to figure that out
[22:08:30] <Gurkenglas> unless, i guess, it comes out now that satoshi has been selling 10% per year for years to eat and nobody opened those wallets because that would cause a panic
[22:09:18] <PapuaHardyNet> okay now you've lost me. You cannot sell "10%" without moving money unless you send wallet keys
[22:09:32] <PapuaHardyNet> which sends 100% of all the bitcoin associated with that wallet
[22:09:35] <Gurkenglas> i suppose satoshi would be able to come up with a good story of why he needs money now ("hey guys i just found this ai safety thing it looks pretty important") and then there would be less crashing
[22:10:09] <ggreer> yeah you need confirmations on chain to change ownership. the only other way is to hand over the password & wallet.dat 
[22:10:28] <Gurkenglas> Is satoshi's wallet a single wallet?
[22:11:13] <PapuaHardyNet> does it change the fact that you cannot send 10% without an actual transaction?
[22:11:37] <Gurkenglas> you can sell a ticket to a contract-game that has a 10% chance of winning your wallet.
[22:11:42] <gwern> the funnest scenario is it's been in a roth ira this whole time
[22:13:45] <Gurkenglas> you can put stocks in "an account where you pay taxes on disposal, not withdrawal"? why would you ever put stocks anywhere else
[22:15:44] <gwern> because you want to sell and consume earlier than that, and it's annoying and unusual
[22:16:14] <gwern> but yes, personal finance types are endlessly irritated that people do not fill up their vanguard IRA and Roth IRA every year without fail
[22:16:16] <Gurkenglas> oh such accounts are restricted to only withdrawing after a certain date? yeah that'd be funny.

[22:50:07] <Robomot> Live Text is no longer an M1-exclusive in Apple’s newest macOS Monterey beta - The Verge (The fourth macOS Monterey beta introduces support for Apple’s image scanning feature, Live Text, on all devices that run Monterey, according to documentation from Apple. That should include Intel-based Macs that previously weren’t supported.)
[22:50:11] <adiabatic> actually it's a Monterey feature
