[00:07:18] <river> :D
[00:10:00] <gwozniak> My wife is out getting beer for tonight.  It's a thing for us on St. Pat's Day
[00:10:35] <gwozniak> Also, she is taking a student to see an optometrist
[00:12:31] <river> fun times!
[00:14:29] <skyl4rk> getting a pair of beer goggles?
[00:16:47] <gwozniak> She can't stand to look at me anymore
[00:36:25] <gwozniak> Looks like the next thing I'm going to have to learn a lot better is DWARF format

[01:27:09] <ngoldbaum> does anyone actually know what the deal is with alynpost and prgmr?
[01:27:28] <ngoldbaum> just curious but looking back on it seems hinky
[01:28:19] <river> i've also been wondering about that
[01:28:42] <river> also why as alyn so weird when i asked for the bot source code
[01:32:09] <river> also lol
[01:32:19] <river> one time I was just kind of venting about how skarnet from s6 was really abusive to me
[01:32:23] <river> and he like
[01:32:33] <river> made a thing about how much he lieks skarnet and s6
[01:32:53] <river> and joined the chan and said positive stuff
[01:32:55] <river> and its like ok
[01:33:03] <river> that's totally fine if you think all that
[01:33:04] <river> but timing
[01:33:14] <indigo> Apparently they rebranded, now it is called Tornado VPS
[01:33:53] <river> tbf same happened when you guys banned googer
[01:34:09] <river> some dude here was like 'aw i liked him and his cat' like ok hwhat does that have to do with me bro
[01:34:35] <ngoldbaum> loool searching on twitter, alynpost was posting a bunch of pro-trump conspiracy bullshit right around and after the election
[01:34:45] <river> pro-trump.....??
[01:34:49] <ngoldbaum> his tweets are protected but you can still see people replying to him
[01:34:52] <river> doesn't he have ear gauges
[01:34:56] <river> im not trying to sterotype people but
[01:35:04] <river> it seems like a strange combination
[01:37:45] <indigo> Ah, Twitter
[01:37:50] <indigo> Important news of the hour "Pete Davidson had Kim Kardashian’s name branded into his skin"
[02:33:14] <Church> Still need to run my credit out on prgmr heh
[02:34:24] <drakonis> lol what the fuck
[02:34:47] <drakonis> was this weird shit with alyn why lobsters no longer gets free hosting?
[02:35:11] <gerikson> kudos to MJD for basically admitting he knows zip about Unix anymore :D https://blog.plover.com/
[02:35:12] <buttsbot> The Universe of Discourse
[02:35:45] <river> is /dev/full real..
[02:36:06] <gerikson> well yeah
[02:36:29] <drakonis> so it is!
[02:36:45] <river> wonder what else is in there
[02:37:11] <gerikson> everything
[02:37:14] <gerikson> it's full
[02:37:38] <river> lol
[02:37:45] <gerikson> wow this headline is extremely late 2021/early 2022 ``Fact-Finding Fauci Led to My Cancellation at Forbes''
[02:47:06] <ngoldbaum> has snowden said anything since russia invaded ukraine?
[02:47:23] <ngoldbaum> tfw the russians weren’t a great option
[02:47:44] <river> lol i forgot about snowden
[02:47:55] <river> probably safer than us though
[02:48:53] <gerikson> isn't Twitter banned
[02:48:59] <gerikson> in Russia
[02:49:13] <river> i think he still tweeted while there
[02:49:36] <ngoldbaum> https://twitter.com/badastronomer/status/1504597981680611331
[02:49:36] <buttsbot> Twitter - badastronomer - I did a little math. If you hollowed out this entrie rocket and packed it with $1 bills, it would cost less than it did to build it.
[02:54:21] <epilys> snowden was just stuck in russia iirc, it wasn't his choice
[02:54:56] <ngoldbaum> i mean, he could have gone home and stood trial
[02:54:59] <ngoldbaum> ellsberg won
[03:20:32] <gwozniak> ngoldbaum: I don't think alynpost is involved with prgmr/tornadovps anymore.  I host my stuff there and I noticed him gone in email replies
[03:20:50] <gwozniak> and "oof" on some stuff on Twitter with him in the replies
[03:21:29] <ngoldbaum> didn’t he own prgmr?
[03:21:34] <ngoldbaum> maybe he sold it
[03:23:28] <Church> He did own it maybe he sold it
[03:23:51] <drakonis> oof stuff eh?
[03:26:15] <gwozniak> If he's still there maybe he's low-key

[06:20:27] <kline> ill try but it relies on me seeing it
[06:20:59] <drakonis> righto
[06:43:34] <kronk> so, I see node-ipc was "hijacked"
[06:43:54] <kronk> I like it. fuck russia.
[07:00:16] <companion_cube> removing files? that's just evil
[07:00:30] <companion_cube> fucks with people who didn't choose that, too
[07:00:41] <Church> I mean it's pretty fucked up
[07:00:46] <Church> Great way to never get y
[07:00:53] <Church> your code trusted again*
[07:01:01] <Xe> i mean i get the idea that a protest should be hard to ignore or it's not an effective protest, but goddamn
[07:01:35] <Church> Hmm I need to find some cinnamon syrup...
[07:01:45] <Xe> some what
[07:02:41] <Church> Syrup that tastes like cinnamon?
[07:02:52] <Church> Got a SodaStream so I've been making soda at home
[07:03:01] <Church> Wanna make some vanilla cinnamon soda
[07:04:36] <companion_cube> yeah and why would you protest random russian people?
[07:04:43] <companion_cube> rather than Putin
[07:05:03] <Xe> to inspire them to revoke the mantle of responsibility?
[07:05:25] <companion_cube> what does that mean?
[07:05:52] <Xe> overthrow the government?
[07:05:56] <companion_cube> ah well
[07:06:11] <companion_cube> might take a bit more than fucking a few devs via npm
[07:24:04] <Xe> i'm not saying it makes sense
[07:24:06] <Xe> fwiw
[07:31:28] <kronk> the thought of the hacker circles of russia using node shit makes me chortle.
[07:34:22] <ngoldbaum> kronk: i mean…. https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FOGgFx5XoAI80Vk?format=jpg&name=medium
[07:35:43] <kronk> I don't trust that lmao.
[07:35:54] <kronk> considering none of that is verifiable.
[07:39:50] <ngoldbaum> regardless, imo punishing the people of belarus and russia is counterproductive to the goal of stopping russian aggression
[07:49:12] <companion_cube> kronk: why wouldn't they?
[07:56:11] <kronk> it's just amusing is all.

[18:18:29] <gwozniak> heh
[18:19:08] <gwozniak> Alright.  Review of junior dev's code is done for the time being.
[18:19:50] <gwozniak> Needed a bit of guidance on some server design stuff.  They weren't quite getting at the meat of the problem
[18:22:34] <gwozniak> asyncio doesn't make everything "just work" ;)
[18:24:16] <Brekkjern> It sometimes just makes things not work :P
[18:25:24] <gwozniak> I wasn't clear in the original design meeting how the "thread pool" part worked.  They have the basics of a server running, but there is a lot more work to do so that it does, well, actual work
[18:28:59] <Brekkjern> I should probably sit down and actually learn how threading and asyncio works...
[18:29:20] <Brekkjern> I've made shit that uses it and it worked, but that doesn't mean that I actually understood what the fuck I was doing
[19:00:41] <gerikson> gotta wonder what straw editor this dude is using https://lobste.rs/s/yypvgf/text_editors_through_years_my_little#c_u0ftl8

[19:13:11] <gwozniak> Those kinds of "tricks" are mostly a waste of time, in my experience
[19:13:30] <gwozniak> I hardly use them and they don't really make me more "productive" at all
[19:13:56] <gwozniak> Navigation is way more important than insert/delete shortcuts
[19:20:14] <gerikson> I mean, if I need to do stuff like that, emacs has macros
[19:21:26] <edk> that sort of thing is useful for a few reasons
[19:21:46] <edk> the first is that it is very quick once you've internalised all of it, but the second is you can record macros that do extremely complicated things
[19:22:15] <gerikson> yes, and you can "see" the recording
[19:22:37] <gerikson> I can be as dumb as I want
[19:22:52] <edk> yeah
[19:23:24] <gwozniak> Whenever I have to do funky editing with repetitions, I use (Emacs) macros.  They work very well when the sitution arises
[19:23:51] <edk> any time i need to take a bunch of data and change how it's formatted but in a more subtle way than just reading it all into a program then serializing it out again, i'm very glad that i know vim
[19:24:04] <edk> although emacs would work just as well obviously, not trying to start an editor war
