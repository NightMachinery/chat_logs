[03:20:15] <Hunterkll> that makes sense if they're probably just going to replace the whole upper chassis 
[03:21:37] <Telgareith> have to send it in because there's no way to remove the screw in the field

[03:47:55] <parted> sendgrid public IPs constantly get hit with bans
[03:47:58] <Telgareith> not really possible
[03:48:25] <parted> i think part of the problem with sendgrid is that they have azure integration
[03:49:51] <Telgareith> email server load would go up dramatically if not exponentially, at the edge. verifiying every email that came through them's DMARC and other things I don't remember 
[03:50:09] <Telgareith> and the core nevermind
[03:50:27] <Telgareith> because what if an 'edge' email server got hacked
[03:50:54] <parted> verification isnt that bad on cpu resources, infinitely better than Anti-virus/spam
[03:51:16] <parted> (in my experiance)
[03:51:23] <Telgareith> intermediate servers don't do spam
[03:51:25] <Telgareith> afaik
[03:52:49] <Hunterkll> yea our servers verify everything out the ass you can with exchange lol
[03:52:57] <Hunterkll> and have addon software on top of that doing processing too

[13:13:21] <DrZak> lol fuckin piece of shit electric cars
[13:13:45] <DrZak> i have a colleague who drives from .cz to berlin, 590km in total
[13:14:07] <DrZak> its 5-6 hrs on a diesel car
[13:14:23] <CableNinja> 12 in an electric because you have to stop
[13:14:36] <DrZak> a vw id.4 family with long range has 520km, but, in winter its about 250 km
[13:14:47] <SirSceptalot> You have to stop in any type of car. Else you'll go past your destination.
[13:14:49] <DrZak> this means, realistically unless you have balls of steel, you need to charge 3 times
[13:15:29] <DrZak> so, instead of 5-6 hours, you have 1,5-2 hrs of charging extra IF the chargers are free
[13:15:53] <DrZak> so, right now, he left at 5am, and got to do work at 10-12
[13:16:07] <DrZak> did the work, slept in hotel, worked the next day till 3pm and left for home
[13:16:16] <DrZak> he arrived at 8-10pm
[13:16:32] <CableNinja> smh
[13:16:54] <DrZak> if he starts at 5am with e car, he' has no chance of arriving before 2-3pm where you really cant start anything at work
[13:17:20] <DrZak> so, you have to spend an extra night in the hotel coming in
[13:17:55] <CableNinja> definitely savin that money by not spending it on gas tho!
[13:17:56] <DrZak> and, the next day after he would normally leave at 3pm - he cant - he wouldnt make it :D, so that's 2nd extra night in hotel
[13:18:03] <CableNinja> EXCEPT WHEN YOU PAY FOR THE HOTEL
[13:18:14] <DrZak> and he can start in the morning
[13:22:09] <SirSceptalot> Rebuttal: during the 2 years of pandemic so far I've had to take my electric car to a fuel station exactly zero times.
[13:22:57] <CableNinja> thats because you dont fuel electric cars you dope!
[13:23:11] <DrZak> Listen to your heart
[13:23:18] <DrZak> <3 - do coccaine and fuck strangers
[13:23:41] <SirSceptalot> Furthermore: a diesel car sucks if you want to haul 10 tons of cargo. What do you get? A truck. What's my point? You buy a vehicle that fits your use case
[13:24:29] <SirSceptalot> If you need to drive 600km daily and don't have a garage, you're probably better off with a fossil fuel car
[13:25:05] <monr0e> SirSceptalot: No, you buy a buick.
[13:25:40] <CableNinja> imo the *idea* of an electric car is great, the current implementation of electric car, is fucking atrocious 
[13:25:47] <SirSceptalot> you buy whatever c1 uses to take his mom places
[13:26:04] <SirSceptalot> no it isn't CableNinja, it's just not perfect - nor will it ever be
[13:26:25] <SirSceptalot> neither are diesel or petrol cars
[13:26:46] <monr0e> I'm a caveman and like brum brum, but the Fisker Karma was a fucking beautiful car
[13:26:57] <CableNinja> Im not saying fossil fuel cars are any better, but at least you can go more than a few cities away
[13:27:22] <CableNinja> the current battery tech is really the problem
[13:27:45] <SirSceptalot> I'm not even going to try to refute that. You can't do as many miles with a charge as you can with a full tank of gas.
[13:27:51] <CableNinja> and we're also using fossil fuels to generate the electricity to charge the electric cars, so.. is it really *that* much better?
[13:28:07] <SirSceptalot> What I will say is that it's stupid to buy a car based on a scenario that might occure once or twice a year
[13:28:14] <monr0e> From an eficiency standpoint, yes
[13:29:16] <CableNinja> SirSceptalot, yeah. I do however use my SUV pretty regularly, and I go on long drives weekly, could at any point in the weekend decide I'm gonna just go camping, so I keep my gear there. dog also doesnt like riding in sedans or coupes

[13:29:42] <SirSceptalot> like I said CableNinja: buy a car that fits your needs
[13:29:46] <CableNinja> yeah

[13:30:58] <SirSceptalot> Just the blanket "electric cars suck" irks me because it's often based on bollocks, generlisations and more bollocks
[13:31:45] <CableNinja> I havent been able to find it since I first saw it, but I saw a company that was making old 40's/50's style electric coupes
[13:31:57] <CableNinja> they were up in price, but they were super sleek
[13:32:30] <SirSceptalot> You mean one off's/conversions, or legit full new car production line?
[13:33:02] <CableNinja> it seemed like production line, but low numbers
[13:33:11] <SirSceptalot> I dunno what morgan has been up to lately, they used to have a few nice retro models. Not really for yer average joe though
[13:33:35] <CableNinja> yeah
[13:33:45] <monr0e> Personally, whilst electric cars are interesting, I find my caveman brain sees them as childrens toys. When I see an ICE vehicle I can appreciate the entirety of its mechanical engineering in just a second of hearing it idle. An electric car is very hard to appreciate, and even harder to "feel".

[13:37:28] <CableNinja> I think the last one was maybe 2-3 months ago or something?

[13:37:46] <SirSceptalot> poopoo in the pantalone
[13:43:01] <CableNinja> monr0e, they happen fairly frequently. usually BGP is great at preventing such things, but there are occasionally 'oopsy' moments where someone exposes a bunch of shit or things like that, but there are also malicious bgp poisoning events which cause legit sites to go down, or be routed elsewhere

[13:46:23] <CableNinja> >November 2018: US-based China Telecom site originated Google addresses.[24]
[13:46:28] <CableNinja> big enough to take down google
[13:46:53] <CableNinja> >December 2017: Eighty high-traffic prefixes normally announced by Google, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Twitch, NTT Communications, Riot Games, and others, were announced by a Russian AS, DV-LINK-AS (AS39523).[20][21]
[13:50:10] <kerat58> interesting.  I always wondered "who" or "what" is the gatekeeper/controler for announcements
[13:51:55] <monr0e> Cor, I heard about some of this btu I had no idea of the scale
[13:52:13] <CableNinja> kerat58, you configure peering with another network, and then routes are advertised; ex: I hold 1.2.0.0/8
[13:53:02] <CableNinja> https://www.kwtrain.com/blog/bgp-pt4
[13:53:07] <CableNinja> quick example
[13:55:41] <CableNinja> aaand > At each BGP-enabled device, policy configuration is required to export the local, static, or IGP-learned routes into the BGP RIB and then advertise them as BGP routes to the other peers. BGP's advertisement policy, by default, does not advertise any non-BGP routes (such as local routes) to peers.
[13:56:50] <CableNinja> so basically by 'misconfiguring' your BGP session, policies, and network, you can in turn cause a poison event

[15:02:31] <Kiernian|Work> LOL
[15:02:32] <monr0e> Speaking of, I'm not sure I'm a fan of the new Picard series
[15:02:45] <Kiernian|Work> I liked the first season quite a bit once it got going
[15:03:13] <monr0e> It feels like they made Q deliberately evil, when he was realy just an entitiy that doesn't understand the impact of his actions on what he considers "lesser" races
[15:03:20] <Kiernian|Work> it's definitely got a bit of a fan service feel to it, but once the central plot point is revealed I found it quite neat
[15:03:36] <monr0e> The first season was... okish, but they obeyed the new timeline so it isn't canon
[15:03:41] <Kiernian|Work> oh, I haven't made it to anything that has Q in it yet. I must be farther behind than I thought, heh.
[15:03:52] <monr0e> The new season started a week ago
[15:04:00] <monr0e> you have two episodes to watch
[15:04:32] <monr0e> oh, yeah, and there's a bit too much fan service too. Dropping phrases, that sorta thing

[15:17:19] <Kiernian|Work> correction -- *on OUR end
[15:18:15] <Kiernian|Work> any truck roll is blamed on the customer-provided modem and therefore costs you money...if you can get them to roll truck

[19:21:41] <sd> 04<F​eralTerminator> But since upgrading from consumer routers to using the computer running pfsense and just using the router for wireless and a 48 port switch... my home network has drastically improved in stability
[19:21:42] <Hunterkll> brcm80211
[19:21:52] <Hunterkll> but yea, i can understand hardware support being a limiting factor in choice, lol
[19:22:07] <Hunterkll> Azem: good fucking luck, hope you know a fair amount about tuning solaris kernel parameters and writing driver support
[19:22:08] <Hunterkll> :>
[19:22:27] <nx032> vyos corporate is how much? $6k/yr?
[19:22:32] <Hunterkll> download virtual box and enable WHV feature
[19:22:41] <Hunterkll> nx032: yea, but it's the same as what's in the OSS trees, that's just a support sub 
[19:22:43] <Azem> you do that on your server or ? 
[19:22:47] <Azem> My boxes run Hyper-V
[19:22:51] <Hunterkll> yes

[19:23:00] <Azem> alright, will do, thanks for info
[19:23:06] <Hunterkll> that will just work
[19:23:08] <sd> 04<F​eralTerminator> azym So this is just like pfsense in the your installing it to a computer?
[19:23:29] <Hunterkll> Solaris is not like pfsense
[19:23:30] <Hunterkll> :>
[19:23:31] <Hunterkll> lolol
[19:23:35] <nx032> not too bad of a price once i interconnect all our sites, may or may not be an option will have to set up a home lab and test it
[19:23:52] <Azem> @FeralTerminator if you are asking about VyOS, yeah its Linux distro with some additional tooling on top of it
[19:24:05] <Hunterkll> Azem: also, they removed the driver from solaris 11 that hyper-v legacy nic needs
[19:24:11] <Hunterkll> and there's no paravirt driver for solaris
[19:24:13] <Hunterkll> so
[19:24:15] <Hunterkll> you'll have fun there too
[19:24:16] <Hunterkll> :D

[19:24:23] <Hunterkll> I've been porting the macOS paravirt driver to solaris
[19:24:24] <Hunterkll> :D

[19:27:05] <Azem> @FeralTerminator This blog has a really good guide for starters, VyOS docs will provide additional snippets for start like port forwarding but this should get you off the ground really well
[19:27:06] <Azem> https://blog.kroy.io/2020/05/04/vyos-from-scratch-edition-1/
[19:27:29] <Hunterkll> basically, vyos acts/manages like a "real" router
[19:27:41] <Hunterkll> with a slightly friendlier config syntax than cisco, but less verbose than juniper 
[19:27:54] <Azem> syntax is a breeze to work with
[19:27:54] <Hunterkll> though, hilariously, Vyatta, which brocade acquired, became brocade's virtual router product, and thus the VyOS fork was born
[19:28:21] <Azem> oh lol

[22:14:57] <bomb> is that guy and McDonaldsWiki are the same person?
[22:16:46] <fritzwastaken> No, PublicWifi isnt smart enough to run a Wiki
[22:16:54] <int0x1C8> technically yes, different personalities though
[22:17:40] <int0x1C8> Public seems to be the dominant one now, McDonalds hasn't come out in ages
[22:18:10] <bomb> lol same person but different personality by nickname?
[22:18:30] <DrGibby> aww
[22:18:36] <DrGibby> Maccas isn't an idiot 
[22:18:39] <DrGibby> be nice to him
[22:18:43] <nx032> ah yes i loved his acting in split
[22:19:01] <fritzwastaken> lol I know, he also isnt fat
[22:19:14] <int0x1C8> yes, one is a sysadmin who knows about as much as L1 helldesk, the other is a L1 helldesk with the knowledge of a sysadmin
[22:19:19] <fritzwastaken> he certainly contributes higher quality content to the channel than I do
[22:19:39] <bomb> what's his youtube channel?
[22:19:54] <int0x1C8> goatse
[22:20:04] <int0x1C8> er wait
[22:20:07] <DrGibby> nah
[22:20:09] <DrGibby> goatse

[22:26:31] <DrGibby> fucking weev
[22:36:02] <bomb> old news. nobody cares about neo nazis anymore. everyone's applauding Azov Battalion.
[22:58:35] <fritzwastaken> Slow ass chat today
[22:58:43] <PublicWifi> estranger: that hurt my feelings
[22:58:51] <PublicWifi> DrGibby: thank you for being a true friend Mr Gibbs
[22:59:13] <bomb> he PMd me your naked pics tho
[22:59:17] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> Got slammed with last minute shit at work so I'm not on here trolling as usual
[23:00:27] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> Got an permissions on Monday, architecture on Tuesday, and told to delivery by Friday.
[23:01:13] <sd> 14<K​illnine> Anyone here do archives for their org?
[23:01:24] <PublicWifi> @Killnine I kind of do
[23:01:29] <PublicWifi> not the way I wish I could..
[23:01:45] <sd> 14<K​illnine> What do you do for archives?
[23:01:45] <Hunterkll> I've helped repair win95 machines in our archives before
[23:01:46] <Hunterkll> heh
[23:02:04] <Hunterkll> some regulatory requirements in gov't contracting require a lot of data access and retention sometimes....
[23:02:07] <sd> 14<K​illnine> I'm wondering if you store the whole filesystem or wrap stuff into ZIPs or something
[23:02:09] <PublicWifi> I move it to some "archive" offline storage 
[23:02:25] <PublicWifi> sometimes I zip it depending on what it is
[23:02:50] <Hunterkll> whole system backups on massive tape racks
[23:02:51] <Hunterkll> heh
[23:02:54] <Hunterkll> offsite'd 
[23:02:55] <sd> 14<K​illnine> We have some old backups of exchange servers that have literally millions of files. Sounds terrible to store all those somewhere. I'd rather bundle together
[23:02:58] <Hunterkll> with onsite 7-year retention D2D
[23:03:00] <PublicWifi> yeah I'd like to do it with tapes
[23:03:07] <Hunterkll> for data that is olike, financial and SOX related that only has 7 year requirements
[23:03:12] <PublicWifi> do you have veeam or datto?
[23:03:58] <sd> 14<K​illnine> I have datto. But I have a lot of data that falls into a category of "this isn't expected to be used but might in litigation situation" (audit, taxes, litigation).
[23:04:14] <sd> 14<K​illnine> Our old ERP (quickbooks) data
[23:04:42] <Hunterkll> again
[23:04:43] <PublicWifi> yeah I have some of that stuff copied to 2-3 different "archives"
[23:04:50] <Hunterkll> you should have defined retention requirements for stuff like that
[23:04:52] <PublicWifi> I really want tape but work won't do it
[23:04:57] <Hunterkll> email that isn't financial? purged after 90 days, no recovery 
[23:05:03] <Hunterkll> if the user doesn't manually archive it
[23:05:03] <Hunterkll> etc
[23:05:06] <PublicWifi> yeah we keep ours 7 years.. but PHI involves children is soemthing dumb like 13 years, I can't remember
[23:05:11] <PublicWifi> involving*
[23:05:15] <sd> 14<K​illnine> Yes, we have that defined and now I am to implementation
[23:05:20] <Hunterkll> as long as you have a defined retention policy,s hredding the evidence is OKAY :D
[23:05:50] <PublicWifi> some of my "lazy" archiving was just taking a backup of that VM on veeam and stashing it in my archive spots lol
[23:05:56] <PublicWifi> but best case you'd have tapes
[23:06:07] <Hunterkll> we just age out old backups, yolo
[23:06:08] <sd> 14<K​illnine> Right. So I was looking at bundling stuff up into chunks according to those policies, dating the archives, and then putting into Azure Blob Storage archive tier
[23:06:12] <Hunterkll> rotate shit or shred it
[23:06:12] <PublicWifi> since they age/store wayy better than disks
[23:06:27] <Hunterkll> heh
[23:06:36] <sd> 14<K​illnine> Yeah I don't like disks as a storage system all that much
[23:06:38] <Hunterkll> we have multiple 10gig links to azure and AWS and we still wouldn't use them for arhive storage
[23:07:00] <sd> 14<K​illnine> This is about 500GB of data, fwiw
[23:07:03] <PublicWifi> @Killnine same, but since I was veto'd on tapes I've just been putting them over 3 sets of disks haha
[23:07:15] <Hunterkll> PublicWifi: our 7-year retention D2D is an online (never off) system that acts as a virtual tape library in addition to a real tape library 
[23:07:16] <PublicWifi> so at least 1 of them will survive in 10 years hopefully right? :D
[23:07:16] <Hunterkll> lol
[23:07:21] <sd> 14<K​illnine> haha
[23:07:25] <Hunterkll> EMC Data domain devices
[23:07:36] <Hunterkll> online 24/7, failures replaced as they happen
[23:07:36] <Hunterkll> etc
[23:08:01] <sd> 14<K​illnine> I just don't want all these files hanging out on our main fileserver when they're really not used and just a liability. It bloats our datto backups a lot
[23:08:01] <sd> 04<F​eralTerminator> Fuck now I gotta find a way to stay awake.. I'm tired as shit today
[23:08:05] <bomb> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uvwGmRf5M8
[23:08:07] <Hunterkll> obviously, of course, they're VTL functioning, and not mounted as shares or anything like that, just iSCSI and Fiberchannel tape drives
[23:08:13] <Hunterkll> so cryptolocker can't really hit them :D
[23:08:23] <PublicWifi> man im torn rn
[23:08:32] <sd> 14<K​illnine> Yeah, that's the other liability of just having this data all on a share
[23:08:34] <PublicWifi> I'm working on getting a job as a presales engineer
[23:08:36] <Hunterkll> @Killnine honestly, with that small amount of data? A stack of BDXL discs
[23:08:37] <Hunterkll> seriously
[23:08:48] <PublicWifi> they are asking me what salary I want but I have no real knowledge of that world lol
[23:08:51] <Hunterkll> 4-5 128GB BDXL discs
[23:09:09] <PublicWifi> my inside person said to expect 130k-ish ballpark but I dont' want to price out myself since I have limited exp lol
[23:09:27] <Hunterkll> well, maybe 100gb
[23:09:33] <Hunterkll> and then toss 'em in the bank safe deposit box 
[23:09:34] <Hunterkll> or something
[23:09:45] <PublicWifi> yeah you want an offline copy anyway @Killnine
[23:09:57] <Hunterkll> we've had AWS lose our data before, permanently :D
[23:09:59] <PublicWifi> I have 1 offline copy offsite and one offline copy onesite
[23:10:07] <sd> 14<K​illnine> 1-2-3-
[23:10:11] <PublicWifi> yeeee
[23:10:56] <PublicWifi> I feel like I'm going to price myself out of a job if I tell this woman I want 120k as entry level SE LOL
[23:11:07] <PublicWifi> but I don't want to jump crafts for the same pay -.-
[23:11:09] <Hunterkll> but a 100GB BDXL disc is like, $14 on average 
[23:11:16] <Hunterkll> and like, $70-100 for a compatible USB drive
[23:11:37] <Hunterkll> one time burn discs introduced in 2010 were 128GB but i don't see them around anymore, just the 100GB rewriteables
[23:11:58] <sd> 14<K​illnine> That sound pretty nice. I could pick that up today
[23:12:04] <Hunterkll> here's the kit I got, https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0843MVJ42/
[23:12:23] <Hunterkll> 1 100GB M-DISC disc, and a USB 3.0 drive
[23:13:00] <Hunterkll> get some cd-burning backup software or dice up your files however, make a stack, or even two for redundancy's sake, put 'em in the case again, and move on
[23:13:08] <Hunterkll> and make sure you get m-disc ones, they're meant for long term archival usage
[23:13:31] <Hunterkll> special types of media and "supposed" to last 1000 years or something crazy 
[23:14:08] <Hunterkll> some kind of carbon fuckery instead of using burnable dyes 
[23:14:34] <sd> 14<K​illnine> Let me spend a bit of time looking into the process of how this would work.
[23:14:46] <bomb> recommend me a NAS
[23:14:52] <Hunterkll> I mean, good CD burning software can take an input, and cut it into multiple discs in a spanning archive of some kind 
[23:14:56] <Hunterkll> bomb: windows server
[23:15:05] <bomb> thanks. what about the hardware?
[23:15:13] <fritzwastaken> Prolly a windows server
[23:15:17] <Hunterkll> bomb: netapp disk shelf and used dell servers from ebay
[23:15:29] * Hunterkll has 48 drives in two disk shelves hooked up to an R730 :)
[23:15:43] <Hunterkll> all different sized drives too, wouldn't really be feasible/possible without windows, especially the SSD caching/tiering 
[23:15:52] <bomb> I don't have a rack at home Hunterkll 
[23:16:04] <Hunterkll> doesn't have to be in a rack
[23:16:09] <Hunterkll> can sit in a pile under the desk
[23:16:11] <CptLuxx> can be in a dishwasher
[23:16:18] <fritzwastaken> it could be a boat!
[23:16:25] <Hunterkll> but get the netapp disk shelves, and you can hook them to any standard SAS card inside any formfactor PC 
[23:16:37] <Hunterkll> the netapp shelves are just standard SAS enclosures, nothing actually proprietary about them
[23:17:14] <Hunterkll> before i started getting into shelves though, I had windows + 15 drives (and 5 dangling SSDs) inside a tower case lol
[23:17:51] <fritzwastaken> I just have never needed that much onsite storage
[23:17:54] <bomb> so it's safe to put a rackmount server on a table like a pizza box?
[23:17:57] <fritzwastaken> im not a media hoarder
[23:18:05] <Hunterkll> absolutely
[23:18:19] <PublicWifi> holy fuck ringcentral's support is dogshit tier
[23:18:24] <fritzwastaken> yup
[23:18:32] <bomb> gotcha. thanks
[23:18:35] <fritzwastaken> alwyas been shit
[23:18:37] <PublicWifi> literally lost them our business, I'm going with ou rnumber 2 option because of this lol
[23:18:48] <PublicWifi> im paying more money jsut so I can get fucking support lol
[23:19:56] <fritzwastaken> s/support lol/
[23:19:56] <layer8> PublicWifi meant: "im paying more money jsut so I can get fucking "
[23:20:07] <PublicWifi> LMFAO
[23:20:13] <CptLuxx> ah the towel nutter is back
[23:20:21] <PublicWifi> and apprently saying "fax user licenses" in teh support chat triggers it to switch to French
[23:20:30] <PublicWifi> can't even talk to a support bot
[23:20:37] <PublicWifi> literally worst than dogshit xD
[23:20:52] <PublicWifi> CptLuxx: I've been called worse things by better people
[23:20:57] <Hunterkll> LOL
[23:21:07] <Hunterkll> this "museum of obsolete media" starts their fuckin data media timeline
[23:21:09] <Hunterkll> in the 1780s
[23:21:12] <Hunterkll> with "catalogue card"
[23:21:13] <Hunterkll> lulz
[23:24:24] <PublicWifi> LMFAO
[23:24:32] <PublicWifi> yeah fuck ringcentral, sorry bros
[23:24:38] <PublicWifi> good prices aint worth this headache
[23:24:49] <Hunterkll> you gotta pay more
[23:24:50] <Hunterkll> :P
[23:24:52] <PublicWifi> yup
[23:24:59] <Hunterkll> no i mean
[23:25:02] <Hunterkll> it's like microsoft support
[23:25:05] <Hunterkll> you get what you pay for
[23:25:05] <PublicWifi> oh fuck lol
[23:25:12] <PublicWifi> I mean ringcentral was spun off of AT&T
[23:25:19] <Hunterkll> oh well
[23:25:24] <Hunterkll> you get what you pay for.... a year later
[23:25:25] <Hunterkll> LOL
[23:25:25] <PublicWifi> so this all fits right in to my usual experience with them
[23:25:27] <PublicWifi> LOL
[23:25:39] <PublicWifi> and they might double bill you sometimes, nbd
[23:25:44] <Hunterkll> but i mean, $499 for unlimited product level support on an incident is, well, a get what you pay for scenario
[23:25:51] <Hunterkll> permier is charged by the hour, and accordingly better :D
[23:26:10] <PublicWifi> tbh in my case the "support" i want is a simlpe fucking licensing question
[23:26:21] <PublicWifi> it should NOT be this hard to figure out their licensing lol
[23:26:21] <Hunterkll> oh
[23:26:23] <Hunterkll> then what the hell
[23:26:28] <PublicWifi> yeah its a clusterfuck
[23:26:32] <Hunterkll> that's a sales person question, not a support ticket
[23:26:40] <Hunterkll> i'd jerk you around if you filed a support ticket for that too
[23:26:54] <PublicWifi> well
[23:27:00] <PublicWifi> its not strictly licensing question
[23:27:08] <Hunterkll> ohhh
[23:27:11] <PublicWifi> idk its retarded, they weren't clear with their explaination
[23:27:17] <PublicWifi> I dont want licenses, I want logins
[23:27:19] <PublicWifi> xD
[23:27:28] <Hunterkll> it's one of those "i dunno what i want, here's a vauge description, i expect concrete answers back, not as vauge as what i gave you"
[23:27:29] <PublicWifi> anyways lets ask sales and see what they say xD
[23:27:34] <PublicWifi> yes
[23:27:40] <PublicWifi> but no lol
[23:27:55] <DomLS3> look at you two jerking each other off in here by yourselves
[23:27:58] <PublicWifi> they said it worked X way, I'm finding it actually works Y way
[23:28:13] <DomLS3> <3
[23:28:26] <Hunterkll> have you tried sucking off gibby?
[23:28:28] <Hunterkll> i hear he works in sales
[23:28:30] <Hunterkll> might help
[23:28:41] <DomLS3> no but have you tried getting sucked off by cryptic1's mom?
[23:28:41] <PublicWifi> ^
[23:28:44] <PublicWifi> gotem
[23:28:47] <Hunterkll> who hasn't?
[23:28:54] <Hunterkll> i think that's required to even enter the channel now

[23:43:14] <PublicWifi> you know whats infuriating? your password creation box allows you to type more characters than you actually will accept
[23:43:19] <PublicWifi> and it clips off a few characters
[23:43:34] <PublicWifi> then the password entry box allows you to again type more characters than you allow, and will say the pw is wrong

[23:58:32] <CableNinja> did you ask a question in #electronics?
[23:58:54] <CableNinja> they're notorious for that, or telling you things that you dont care about
[23:59:09] <DrGibby> it was a coworker
[23:59:31] <DrGibby> then in a different email on a different subject, I asked him a yes/no question. He responded with a statement that has nothing to do with what I asked
