How much peak as an entrepreneur ? Let's say his product gets successful ("if" he even managed to make all of it by himself in a lifetime), what can he do to scale? I think he has to hire more
[07:33:47] <Intelo> people? What if has a different mindset and works in a different way or just not satisfied with other peoples' way of working? A one man show cannot scale? right?

[07:37:08] <thojanssens> Intelo, I have no solution. Personally I just go through it because for me the corporate life is not an option and I can't find any balance professional/private life with full-time jobs. I just get too dedicated in whatever I'm doing. But I don't wish this life to anyone.

[07:37:41] <thojanssens> Intelo, if I can be young again, I would just work as a consultant on a daily rate for like 10 years, invest, and when I'm comfortable financially start a project on my own.

What worries me more is the marketing aspect, not the product. These big companies have millions, and even if your product is better, it doesn't matter when they have the ads.

[14:17:20] <OnkelTem> Hi folks. I'm looking for a code snippet showing a sample of implementing producer-consumer scheme on js with generators
[14:17:26] <OnkelTem> an example*
[14:17:43] <stenno> browser or node?
[14:17:49] <OnkelTem> Found this one so far - https://gist.github.com/narqo/8173984 - but didn't get shit
[14:17:59] <OnkelTem> stenno: no matter I suppose. But I'm node
[14:18:56] <OnkelTem> specifically, as for the gist above: 23 line: `yield consume;` - ?
[14:19:00] <stenno> uses do-while instead of for-await-of, strange
[14:20:14] <OnkelTem> What I doubt about - how to connect generators, outside or from the insisde?
[14:20:36] <stenno> should be yield* queue in line 23, no?
[14:21:17] <OnkelTem> yeah, and why calling it like "consume"? It should be consume() then, as it is a generator
[14:21:35] <stenno> well it yields the consume generator,
[14:22:01] <OnkelTem> erm... consume - a generator function, consume - is a generator
[14:22:12] <OnkelTem> erm... consume - a generator function, consume() - is a generator
[14:22:15] <OnkelTem> sorry
[14:22:20] <stenno> yes
[14:22:35] <stenno> mp i'd have to read this in detail but i am working on something else right now
[14:22:50] <stenno> aah ok
[14:24:03] <stenno> hmm
[14:25:13] <stenno> that code gives me a slight headache
[14:26:27] <OnkelTem> yeah, it's a bad example
[14:26:33] <OnkelTem> hence - my question :)
[14:26:42] <stenno> but the pattern should be: have a generator, have a dispatcher which takes a generator and a list of subscribers, dispatcher yields the generator and passes it to the subscribers

[14:49:05] <pingpongball> it would be cool if my cool function worked

[15:09:32] <ThePhilgrim> Hi, I'm trying to understnad the following Node code. On the last line, how does 'line' get passed into the callback function? When calling the function in the second argument, the argument is never explicitly passed in.
[15:09:34] <ThePhilgrim> https://dpaste.com/G59UUWZCP
[15:11:58] <han-solo> the callback will be given an argument which is the line from the file/stream
[15:13:02] <han-solo> `printData` being the callback
[15:17:47] <ThePhilgrim> han-solo: Thank you for your answers. Right, but how is that argument passed into the function? I guess I'm confused by the call of the callback not being something like printData(line)
[15:17:53] <ThePhilgrim> answer*
[15:18:53] <han-solo> `function callFuncWithData(callback) { callback('hello world'); }`
[15:19:05] <han-solo> `callFuncWithData(console.log)`
[15:20:31] <han-solo> in your case, the when the readline interface get a `'line'` event, it will call the callback passed with the line
[15:20:44] <pingpongball> Here i got elisp answer to do that
[15:20:50] <pingpongball> `(defun cool (a b fun) (apply fun (list a b))) (cool 1 2 '+)`
[15:20:59] <pingpongball> =L
[15:21:52] <stenno> so this is pretty much the solution i provided earlier
[15:22:16] <pingpongball> How do you guys get arcsine in javascript?
[15:22:23] <stenno> Math.asin
[15:22:25] <pingpongball> is that `Math.asin`

[15:22:38] <madprops> any idea on how to make the threshold check more accurate to avoid ugly edges when doing bucket fills? https://dpaste.org/8PWC
[15:23:01] <madprops> this is for the bucket/flood fill algorithm
[15:23:21] <stenno> not familiar with that algo i have to admit
[15:25:46] <han-solo> ThePhilgrim: `myInterface.on('line', cb)` takes a callback, which is a function or callable(i guess), which will be used to provide data at some later point(whever it gets data). Does that clarify ? or did i confuse you even more ?
[15:26:57] <han-solo> `myInterface.on('line', (line) => printData(line));` // can be written like this too, but why bother
[15:28:48] <ThePhilgrim> han-solo I think I get it after your explanation! It's just not super obvious :D
[15:29:18] <pingpongball> How do you write sin square in js?
[15:29:36] <pingpongball> is that `Math.pow(Math.sin(1),2)` correct or theres another way?
[15:29:50] <han-solo> ThePhilgrim: 👍
[15:30:10] <stenno> n> Math.sin(1) ** 2
[15:30:21] <jellobot> (timeout)
[15:30:23] <stenno> n> Math.sin(1) ** 2
[15:30:25] <jellobot> (okay) 0.7080734182735712
[15:30:35] <stenno> the bot has a few hiccups every now and then
[15:30:40] <ThePhilgrim> han-solo: I guess to see how it works, I have to go into the .on() function to see the source code. But if I understand correctly, it basically uses arg one ("line") as an argument when calling whatever function is passed in as arg2
[15:30:48] <stenno> Math.pow works too, but i prefer the operator

[17:59:40] <stenno> there is your answer
[17:59:43] <Donitz> I like === null
[17:59:47] <Donitz> but that's annoying
[17:59:49] <Donitz> fine
[17:59:53] <Donitz> it makes no sense logically

[18:00:26] <stenno> because NaN represents a failed calculation, and it differs from other NaNs in that regard
[18:00:46] <Donitz> do differet nan have different internal states?
[18:00:52] <Donitz> different*
[18:01:00] <stenno> if you had operation1 === operation2, and both operations result in NaN for different reasons, you wouldn't want this to be true in this case
[18:01:13] <Donitz> beh, fine
[18:01:43] <Donitz> mathematically I guess it could help you avoid bugs
[18:02:04] <stenno> btw you want Number.isNaN instead of just the global isNaN
[18:02:14] <Donitz> why
[18:02:22] <stenno> n> [isNaN('hello'), Number.isNaN('hello')]
[18:02:23] <jellobot> (okay) [ true, false ]
[18:02:37] <Donitz> that is very dumb
[18:03:33] <Donitz> say what you will about null, at least it's predictable
[18:03:39] <Donitz> null === null
[18:04:00] <Donitz> which is why I use it as empty values almost all the time
[18:04:42] <stenno> NaN should only ever represent the result of an invalid calculation, nothing else
[18:05:09] <Donitz> I often see it as empty placeholder values in non-sparse floating point arrays
[18:05:13] <Donitz> and there it makes absolute sense
[18:05:39] <stenno> dunno if i can agree here..
[18:05:52] <Donitz> you don't have much of a choice
[18:06:04] <stenno> null should be just fine
[18:06:15] <Donitz> null can not be used in many pure arrays

[18:08:46] <Donitz> I've seen it often in numpy with python and r
[18:08:57] <Donitz> well, r uses NA

[23:01:53] <onosendi> mikrosis: dpaste is giving me an error when I paste, so this will have to do. Here's a very simple example: https://pastebin.com/EMhc8cwz
[23:03:07] <onosendi> mikrosis: you'll still have to save your cart's state to something like `localStorage`, because your cart's contents will be gone when you refresh.
[23:05:11] <onosendi> mikrosis: you can use a `useLocalStorage` hook, and replace `const [cart, setCart] = useState([]);` with `const [cart, setCart] = useLocalStorage('cart', []);`: https://usehooks.com/useLocalStorage/

[23:27:13] <mikrosis> I try to understand what it actually is used for
[23:28:00] <onosendi> mikrosis: `children` is everything <CartProvider> wraps. In my example, look at index.jsx.

[23:28:39] <mikrosis> the cartprovider element wraps the whole app so the app elements can use the context
[23:28:43] <mikrosis> cart should be usable globally

[23:58:50] <onosendi> mikrosis: honestly, I don't use React's context, so that was a learning experience for me too. May not be 100% correct.
