[00:49:57] <memelover> appears to be, according to other systems), what other reasons could there be for this message?

The part I'm not sure about is if the firmware will play Monte Carlo and let some sectors wear out more before moving the stale data there, where they wouldn't be moved again for longer period of time (to assure less moving),, or play it safe

[02:04:32] <hexnewbie> Still, if you have 80% of sectors who have 800 writes left, and 20% of sectors who have 200 writes left, it would make sense to write to the used sectors with 800 writes left, writing the data that was there to those with 200 left, if some statistics recorded about them give you some reason to believe they wouldn't be written to soon, or often

[04:27:56] <FuriousGeorge> i have a vm which was timing out when i was starting it from the proxmox gui while the system was under stress
[04:27:56] <gumbo> looking to see how i can contact arcolinux support for an issue. looks like the forums only 1 person answers. followed arch power management guide to keep lid from hibernating and arco still looses connection yet i can do this on all distros. any ideas?
[04:28:32] <FuriousGeorge> i determined (via google) that the 4kb page default page size was causing the delay, while allocating 32gb of memory for this vm
[04:28:39] <keir> gumbo: does Arco have an IRC channel on another network maybe?
[04:29:02] <FuriousGeorge> so i enabled 32 hugepages of 1gb....  now i can start the vm without timeout from the gui.  it starts very fast
[04:29:16] <FuriousGeorge> but when i look at meminfo, i still have 32 free hugepages
[04:29:21] <FuriousGeorge> why is that?
[04:29:32] <spyroboy> not huge enough

[04:30:26] <spyroboy> the performance improvement is probably because it was already cached in memory.
[04:30:28] <FuriousGeorge> spyroboy:  unlikely
[04:30:31] <FuriousGeorge> AnonHugePages:  101947392 kB
[04:30:44] <FuriousGeorge> the anonhugepages does grow from around 60 gb iirc
[04:30:48] <koo5_> jaggz: no idea, but why?
[04:31:06] <FuriousGeorge> ShmemHugePages:        0 kB
[04:31:06] <FuriousGeorge> FileHugePages:         0 kB
[04:31:07] <FuriousGeorge> These stay at zero
[04:31:14] <spyroboy> regarding hugepages, I don't think applications can arbitrarily use them. do you know if your vm software supports hugepages?
[04:31:15] <FuriousGeorge> but like i said, the vms load much faster
[04:31:24] <spyroboy> see point 1.

[04:31:46] <spyroboy> see point 2.
[04:32:07] <FuriousGeorge> once i set default_size, size, and number in cmdline, i noticed an order of magnitude difference in vm load times under load
[04:32:28] <spyroboy> try rebooting
[04:32:31] <spyroboy> and see if it's still fast
[04:32:32] <FuriousGeorge> with respect to point 1, they are 1gb, which is as huge as they can get in linux
[04:32:38] <ayecee> is that a figurative order of magnitude, or literal?
[04:32:40] <spyroboy> no the other point 1.

[09:17:25] <Gry> yrdsb: do you view web sites often? do you do anything outside of web browser at all? websites are getting a bit boring in this century, in 1990s they were a lot cooler
[09:17:34] <jim> yrdsb, you got my message?
[09:17:37] <yrdsb> yes
[09:17:40] <yrdsb> 20.04
[09:17:43] <jim> good
[09:17:46] <jensen> nice
[09:17:55] <yrdsb> should i upgrade to 21.10
[09:17:56] <catbeard> yrdsb: what comes up when you visit at school wifi
[09:18:03] <yrdsb> it say
[09:18:04] <yrdsb> its blocked
[09:18:09] <yrdsb> and i cant access it
[09:18:09] <catbeard> does it say why
[09:18:13] <yrdsb> cptdb.ca
[09:18:15] <yrdsb> and pling.com
[09:18:18] <yrdsb> are social sites
[09:18:26] <yrdsb> my school wifi even block https://discord.com
[09:18:32] <yrdsb> which is also a  social site
[09:18:35] <catbeard> can't have socialism i guess
[09:18:49] <Vieillard> yrdsb, the ENTER key is not punctuation. Stop spewing fragments.
[09:18:56] <jim> yrdsb, often, the name of a package is all you need to know in order to install it

[09:19:34] <jim> yrdsb, in this case it turned out they used the same name as the software itself, to name the package
[09:19:42] <Vieillard> We know nothing of discord; it's irrelevant here.
[09:19:48] <endrigo> An user dared me to write "Let's go brandon" here i dont understand what does it mean?
[09:20:01] <n4dir> what is worse: we know nothing about that school's wifi
[09:20:04] <Gry> yrdsb: people use discord because it has flashing images; if you think twice, it's a bit boring, as you don't learn anything from it
[09:20:48] <catbeard> yrdsb: one thing has nothing to do with the other here, separate your questions into complete sentences, please.

[16:29:47] <gurkenglas> phogg, is sanitizing the input not just validating that the input conforms to the language?
[16:29:52] <phogg> gurkenglas: it's unlikely that the way that users express their queries maps one-to-one with how they're run. It will probably take at least one parse pass over the input to understand it and then construct a query from the results. It's not as if the user's text will be literally passed to a backing database.

[16:31:48] <koollman> phogg: in many sql api, there are no easy/safe way to restrict column names or to let the use shape the query while keeping it valid and not allowing more than what you wanted. graphql makes it easier to do that in a reasonably safe way
[16:32:17] <gurkenglas> phogg, i mean such things as that when you need to join and select and so on a bunch of tables together they need to figure out how to efficiently get that info out of the database.

[16:32:26] <koollman> most sql api protect data when they are used for query filtering, but it's harder to do it 'right' (in general) for column names or tables, or to write a join, for example

[16:33:02] <hexnewbie> If you allow the user to write a join, you'd probably crash the database server without a need for an injection
[16:33:07] <phogg> koollman: what it provides is the easy more than the safe. I have rolled my own libraries for this, and there is value in having one that lots of people have looked at and improved. That does add safety, but the language of graphql isn't providing safety, the implementation is.

[20:07:36] <naptastic> "3ms? Nah, can't keep up."
[20:08:06] <purpux> naptastic: Audio is such a mess... hopefully pipewire fixes it somewhat down the line
[20:08:12] <peetaur> network is a server thing... linux rules the server market, so they give it good attention. audio not so much...
[20:08:48] <koollman> well, it got attention, but maybe not the good kind :)
[20:08:51] <moo> thats why they put server in the audio =D

[21:22:21] <msiism> Also, using Firefox basically makes up for anything lightweight being used before running it.
[21:22:22] <sysRPL> so my idea or a desktop program is to write one that allows you to download the entire history of a channel, and sort the videos automatically for you
[21:22:27] <jason1234> i know how to use .asoundrc ---!
[21:22:42] <jason1234> it is easy to use .asoundrc but it means to restart the applications.

[22:24:04] <CaCode> if you install arch with a masterbootrecord mbr and bios without an uefi system do you need to manually reserve the first 512 mb on the hdd?
[22:24:07] <akk> msiism: PRIMARY is way faster to use than the windows/mac clipboard model, and there's no need to move your hand from mouse to keyboard to mouse to keyboard.
[22:24:30] <akk> msiism: And having CLIPBOARD in addition means that you can have a selection stored that doesn't get stomped by selection changes.

[23:31:05] <rendar> colo, problem is that if i add -display, i get blank screen! :(
[23:31:10] <akik> rendar: i use these qemu options for it "-device qemu-xhci,id=xhci -device usb-tablet,bus=xhci.0"
[23:31:25] <rendar> akik, thanks, let's try
[23:31:54] <colo> rendar, even with   -display default,show-cursor=on
[23:31:55] <colo> ?
[23:32:20] <rendar> colo, trying
[23:32:31] <Dagmar> skyfall: Usually you recompile with support for it enabled, but if you're using a distribution-built kernel, they *may* have stuck it in a separate package
[23:33:00] <rendar> ok, akik's options work nicely
[23:33:06] <rendar> colo, now i will try yours

[23:35:12] <rendar> colo, with your options mouse points shows, but it's unmanageable! the mouse will stand only on the y=0 coordinates, i can move only x coordinate
[23:35:20] <rendar> instead with akik's options it works perfectly
[23:35:37] <colo> weird. but happy to read that you found a solution :)
[23:35:37] <rendar> pointer*
[23:35:44] <rendar> colo, well, not yet
[23:36:01] <rendar> because now mouse pointer shows, but without that gl=on option, i have quite slow video
[23:36:38] <akik> rendar: i also use -vga virtio
