[01:28:41] <Segaja> i think that was the main reason yeah. but i wasn't really involved in the split

[01:28:56] <jacki> ? (fixed)
[01:29:09] <Segaja> but from my understanding a lot of large files in that package were used by a minority of people and that way the process got faster for most people

[02:56:38] <CarloWood> Hmm, that script isn't changing the mode of /var/lib/AccountsService/ though. It sets /usr/lib to 755, /var/lib/AccountsService/icons/ to 775 and /var/lib/AccountsService/users/ to 700.  I have the same mode for those directories.

[02:58:08] <CarloWood> Unless (os.path.join(localstatedir, 'lib', 'AccountsService', 'icons'), 0o775) inadvertently also created  /var/lib/AccountsService/, using the same mode?
[02:58:40] <CarloWood> If that is what it does that might be why mode 775 sneaked into the *package*. I am not convinced that is correct though.

[03:06:15] <Ghosthree3> writing a pkgbuild for it is the way to go if you can, but as long as the prefix is /usr/local it probably wouldnt be TOO terrible to track down

[05:09:16] <ds> morning! been trying to get virt-manager to be nice for a day or two, so far no dice. NAT should be fine (need net access in guest, but host<->guest otherwise unnecessary) but I must be missing something. Tried routed, bridged, nat and the best I've had (from a combo I can't remember) is ping host<->guest. bridge cuts off net entirely. my current configs attempting NAT again: https://bpa.st/66MQ

[05:10:54] <ds> oh, missed the actual problem - can't get to the net from in a guest (ie to pacman -S anything). tried fedora (kde/networkmanager) and archiso, neither get an address. do i need dhcp on the host or something? host is static if that matters for nat
[05:12:01] <ds> only other thing i can think of is maybe i need to switch from resolvconf to systemd-resolvd, but no idea

[06:09:11] <jmariondev> ip forwarding also needs to be enabled for some of those network modes: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Internet_sharing#Enable_packet_forwarding
[06:09:13] <phrik> Title: Internet sharing - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)

[06:18:16] <ds> jmariondev: i thought libvirt would handle it too for nat, though it does still create a bridge (of sorts?) so maybe it would still need dnsmasq. will look into macvlan, thanks
[06:18:45] <ds> iptables is installed (-nft pkg), but i haven't done any manual config on it. all the rules are from docker or libvirt
[06:20:26] <jmariondev> I've had issues with libvirt talking to nftables, even with the iptables compat packages, but in my case I just went with macvlan and avoided any bridging or routing. I'm sure it is possible to set up "correctly" though, I just haven't bothered yet
[06:21:14] <ds> heh, with the faffing ive been doing I honestly can't blame you. I've been tempted to just go back to vbox
[06:21:55] <ds> until recently (month or two) my system was wildly outdated too, so it's been a game of catchup. might have better luck on a fresh system
[06:22:07] <jmariondev> you can try manually assigning addresses to the guest when using a bridge, that way you can test the rest of the connectivity without worrying about running the DHCP server (dnsmasq)
[06:23:04] <ds> ahhh gotcha, maybe that's it then - I'd read in wiki that it "spins up a DHCP server internally" but didn't make the connection to dnsmasq
[06:23:14] *** Quits: dandels (~dandels@user/dandels) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[06:23:49] <jmariondev> Yeah, you can `ps aux | grep dnsmasq` and you should see an instance running when the libvirt "default" network is running. In my case, starting the "default" network is where it fails for me
[06:24:14] <jmariondev> (due to firewall issues, expected because I'm using nftables instead of iptables like it expects)
[06:24:35] <jmariondev> s/nftables/nft/netfilter/

[11:25:19] *** Joins: seventyfour (~seventyfo@resnet-nat-01.wolf.ox.ac.uk)
[11:25:41] <colo> BIOS and EFI are just different generations of PC firmware. BIOS is old IBM PC/DOS stuff that is still supported, but many modern PC features (such as supporting bootable partitions with more than 2^31 sectors or secure boot) require EFI.
[11:26:13] <thurstylark> !aw efi
[11:26:15] <phrik> thurstylark: EFI - https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/EFI
[11:26:36] <colo> and EFI setups usually offer a Compatibility Support Module (CSM) to boot old-ish BIOS/MBR setups without EFI support in the bootloader/OS
[11:26:37] <jtgd> so here is where I am confused. the installation instructions had me: partition, format, mount, install, chroot, install more, then the last thing it says is install bootloader. But the GRUB instructions begin with "create a partition..." Won't that destroy everything I've just done?

[11:26:58] <NetSysFire> jtgd: i would actually recommend using systemd-boot. it is dead simple to setup, but it is just as simplistic in its features. but unless you want fancy graphics and advanced features you really dont need something else

[12:09:06] <phrik> Always check your journal when possible, not your dmesg. The journal includes the dmesg together with other helpful and possibly relevant logs. journalctl also has more options to search and filter messages.

[18:49:07] <CarloWood> I tried it first with an existing pattern, and that gives the same traceback

[18:54:06] <CarloWood> Apparently --pattern needs something that start with a '+'.  But when I do: borg list /opt/verylarge/backup/borg::daniel-home-carlo-20220208-040010 --pattern "+XTerm"   it just dumps ALL files :/

[19:12:05] <CarloWood> Why is everything so unclear and vague :(.  I used 'fc-list' to list all installed fonts (as per https://ostechnix.com/find-installed-fonts-commandline-linux/), and it lists:
[19:12:14] <CarloWood> /usr/share/fonts/TTF/DejaVuSansMono-BoldOblique.ttf: DejaVu Sans Mono:style=Bold Oblique
[19:12:25] <MacGyver> Because nobody cares about fonts until they break.
[19:12:28] <CarloWood> Then I gamble and change my .Xresources file to:
[19:12:39] <CarloWood> xterm*faceName: DejaVu Sans Mono
[19:12:43] <CarloWood> no effect
[19:12:45] <MacGyver> And the people for whom it breaks aren't invested enough to make the ecosystem user-friendly.

[19:38:06] <CarloWood> Is it possible to remove that application / window class from the normal session restore (using plasma)?
[19:38:35] <CarloWood> That is - normally when I reboot, open terminals are placed back where there were. But I don't want that for this window class.
