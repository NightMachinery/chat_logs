[17:58:40] <Panther> Nope, I think there ia an ongoing competition to see how noisy they can make them.
[17:59:12] <Panther> I did research with one, and it was almost totally quiet.
[17:59:54] <macrobat> fast and silent mri
[18:00:08] <Panther> It was small, tho... powerful, but it was too small to put an adult in. You could put a cat in it, tho.

[18:00:45] <Panther> Nope, it was still a 1.8T magnet,
[18:01:14] <Panther> It tore a gas cylinder out of someone's hands, and it flew across the lab, and smashed the front plate.
[18:02:10] <macrobat> expensive machine, not much throughput. can it do two dozen patients / day? needs prep, maintenance...
[18:02:43] <Panther> Just the hole in it was small... I didn't wotk with cats. In my research, I worked with tissue and organ samples and some various chemical solutions.
[18:03:22] <macrobat> "NO METAL BEYOND THIS POINT!" <-- this sign obv doesn't apply to me lol
[18:04:49] <Panther> Fluorine is also subject to NMR, so this one guy would take live cats and replace their blood with a perfluorinated blood substitute that would carry oxugen and keep them alive for a while. This way, he was mapping the vasculature of their brains. Of course, they couldn't live forever with that stuff in them, so they had to be destroyed.
[18:05:40] <macrobat> :(
[18:05:40] <Panther> macrobat, haha :)
[18:06:28] <Panther> They were 'terminal cats'.. they had already been used for experiements, so they were going to be destroyed anyway eventually.

[18:07:05] <Panther> Ja
[18:08:31] <Panther> I didn't really see the whole point of it, really... no cat is going to have identical vasculature except in very general ways. He got a paper out of it, tho. *shrugs* Science.
