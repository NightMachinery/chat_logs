[04:24:00] <bugs_> have you verified earlier versions
[04:24:59] <BUSY> i've not - 21.1 was my first version and i didn't understand it at that time either :P
[04:25:33] <bugs_> ok so the SHA256SUM.asc file has 13 signatures in it - they are signing
[04:25:42] <bugs_> that the SHA256SUM file is correct
[04:26:27] <bugs_> so you need to have one or more of the 13 signatures in your gpg key ring
[04:26:51] <BUSY> these are public signatures, common to all? any downside to including all 13?
[04:27:20] <BUSY> and i'm not seeing the SHA256SUM file in my tar, am i to hash the whole archive?
[04:27:55] <bugs_> if you visit https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-22.0/
[04:28:13] <bugs_> you can get the SHA256SUM file and the SHA256SUM.asc file plus your
[04:28:19] <bugs_> desired binary package
[04:28:32] <bugs_> are you linux or windows
[04:28:37] <BUSY> linux
[04:29:15] <bugs_> ok so step 1 would be to sha256sum bitcoin-22.0-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz
[04:29:21] <bugs_> that will give you a hash
[04:29:32] <bugs_> then you look in SHA256SUM and see if the hash matches
[04:29:38] *** Quits: sdaftuar1 (~sdaftuar@user/sdaftuar) (K-Lined)
[04:29:56] <bugs_> if the hash matches we can go to step 2
[04:30:08] <BUSY> step 1 success, i have a match
[04:30:38] <bugs_> ok now step 2 is verifying that SHA256SUM is signed by a valid signer
[04:30:51] <BUSY> so i just need to make sure that SHA256SUMS is legit, and gpg will show that one of the 13 signatures signed this file?
[04:31:09] <bugs_> i am not sure this part is going to appear very slick
[04:33:10] <bugs_> so   gpg2 --verify SHA256SUMS.asc
[04:33:24] <bugs_> this will look at the first signature in SHA256SUMS.asc

[04:35:30] <BUSY> i don't think so.  i see only the RSA key used to make the signature
[04:35:41] <BUSY> or is that one and the same
[04:36:08] <bugs_> i think it is.  basically we will ask a key server for the info for that
[04:36:10] <BUSY> not always E2FF, 13 different hex strings

[04:36:39] <BUSY> do i need to concern myself with the security of a keyserver or are there standards?
[04:36:40] <bugs_> well you must have a better version than me
[04:36:48] <bugs_> GOOD QUESTION
[04:37:04] <bugs_> unfortunately i can't answer it
[04:37:33] <bugs_> so anyhow if you take one of the public key id's and do this
[04:37:57] <bugs_> gpg2 --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-key XXXXXXXX
[04:38:05] <bugs_> where XXXXXXXX is the public key id
[04:38:10] <bugs_> you would add them to your ring
[04:38:25] <Ara> You should probably verify, through several different channels, that those are the public keys of the actual developers
[04:38:36] <bugs_> the first one should belong to 0xb10c@gmail.com
[04:39:00] <bugs_> one of the 13 will be wladamir's who has signed the earlier releases
[04:39:24] <bugs_> ara is right of course
[04:39:45] <bugs_> i guess that would be step 3 imho
[04:41:20] <bugs_> so with verified keys in your ring, you can verify SHA256SUM is correct
[04:41:36] <bugs_> and therefore the hash in SHA256SUM that matches the hash of your tarball
[04:41:49] <bugs_> means you have verified your tarball

[21:34:20] <paulo> belcher: is there an advantage to not pruning?
[21:34:32] <belcher> only a very slight advantage
[21:34:57] <belcher> without pruning you can rescan and access old blocks without needing to download them again
[21:34:57] <paulo> the main reason why I'm not pruning is I want to be able to rescan the blockchain in case I use a new electrum (or other wallet) seed
[21:35:21] *** Joins: jdmark (~jdmark@67.8.137.130)
[21:35:26] <belcher> if you create a brand new wallet with a seed then you dont need to rescan, because since its brand new it doesnt have any historical transactions
[21:35:43] <paulo> belcher: that's a good point
[21:35:58] <belcher> do note that you or bitcoin apps on top of core can use the `scantxoutset` RPC call, which allows you to check the balance of a historical wallet (but not the entire history, only the unspent history)
[21:36:12] *** Joins: lucasgonze (~lucasgonz@135-180-49-232.fiber.dynamic.sonic.net)
[21:36:19] <belcher> joinmarket for example makes use of scantxoutset to let people know if the wallet seed they're restoring has a balance on it
[21:36:29] <belcher> then if it does you can make the effort to somehow rescan to get the whole history
[21:36:41] <belcher> scantxoutset works even if pruning is enabled

[21:43:09] <ghost43_> what if all the UTXOs are past the gap limit?
[21:43:16] <belcher> use a gap limit of 5000 or something
[21:43:33] <belcher> the joinmarket docs suggest 5000 at least, users configure higher themselves
[21:43:46] <ghost43_> I see
[21:43:56] <belcher> the way scantxoutset works is the RPC call receives a list of addresses and scans them all at once, it seems to take the same amount of time to scan 1 address as to scan 5000
