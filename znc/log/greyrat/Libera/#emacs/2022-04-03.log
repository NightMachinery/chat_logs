[03:10:30] <grtcdr> One last question, for builtin packages, such as epg-config, should I ensure nil?
[03:10:37] <grtcdr> :ensure nil *
[03:11:00] <corwin> that's what I do (unless the package is 'dual life' meaning also published to an ELPA)

[03:12:00] <corwin> In fact, I'm pretty sure that :ensure isn't smart enough to check if there's a new version available but only that I have some version locally, so probably the best answer is "yes"

[05:07:53] <parsnip0> what is special about this message:
[05:07:56] <parsnip0> _test here_
[05:08:02] <parsnip0> er, one sec, wrong client
[05:08:18] <hominoidea> what is special about this message:
[05:08:20] <hominoidea> test here
[05:08:21] <corwin> underscore wrapping is MD syntax for underline, I think?
[05:08:42] <hominoidea> argh, results broke, back to #test
[05:09:28] <parsnip0> what the hell. it's specific to #test
[05:09:33] <parsnip0> maybe the bridge is different there
[05:11:20] <parsnip0> corwin: right, but on #test, if i send a message completely wrapped in underscore, it's italicized in irccloud. but not otherwise. so i don't understand what's being sent across bridge. and it's not just wrapping it with /me, that displays differently
[05:11:49] <corwin> You could likely get an answer to that in #matrix (or maybe #libera-dev)
[05:12:01] <corwin> Best guess: bridge strips markdown
[05:12:35] <parsnip0> but if i write _markdown_ in irccloud, no italics in irccloud. so i'm confused what the "text" is
[05:13:01] <parsnip0> but right, i'll try escalating to a closer fit channel

[14:21:19] <flaminwalrus[m]> I think risk assesment is an evolutionary problem where it happened to be more efficient to do floating-point risk estimate optimization at the group level, rather than at the individual level. People have almost strictly binary risk assesment of actions, like "skydiving: dangerous," "climbing without a rope: dangerous," or "vaccines: safe," and evolution removes those that assess incorrectly from the population, so populations are
[14:21:19] <flaminwalrus[m]> naturally kept near optimal levels on average, with some risk-takers whose sucessful gambles benefit society as a whole, but aren't common enough to destabillize things. In the example of covid recalcitrance, it is critically important for the scientific process to have control groups, even if the representatives of "the science" forcefully argue otherwise. E.g. Florida, where they wore masks for about a month (but vaccinated very well)
[14:21:19] <flaminwalrus[m]> and ended up with the 26th ranked fatality rate of US states despite having the second-oldest population.

[14:24:21] <bpalmer> flaminwalrus[m]: apparently Florida's vaccination rate wasn't as good as they claimed; as I understand they have a lot of seasonal inhabitants (e.g., New Yorkers who go to Florida for the winter), so it's important to track actual vaccination rate to keep the numerator and denominator consistent
[14:24:50] <bpalmer> isntead of taking the sum of all people who had ever been vaccinated, over the lesser population of non-seasonal inhabitants.
[14:24:56] <parsnip> omg, flashback
[14:25:30] <parsnip> when taking probability course, especially the discrete counting part, one must remember to count consistently in the numerator and denominator

[14:28:27] <flaminwalrus[m]> bpalmer: Yes, that may be true. The other issue is that Florida's vaccinations were extremely striated by age (which may have contributed to the strategy's efficacy), so the young were almost entirely unvaccinated. Note that the numerator/denominator issue also applies to the largely covid-cautious northern states and cities the snowbirds migrate from. I don't think there's much /a priori/ reason to presume that innacuracy would

[14:48:11] <flaminwalrus[m]> Also, I think literalist thinkers would, in less clear terms, argue that axiomatization of their favored religious text is the only way it is possible to truly realize its moral prescriptions in behavior. There's a lot of emphasis in Baptist talk, for instance, on the importance of making Christ the 'lord of one's life' as the first step on the path to 'sanctification' (akin to enlightenment) which, through the identification of deity
[14:48:11] <flaminwalrus[m]> with the Word, means placing the literal prescriptions of the Bible as axiomatic.
[14:48:58] <flaminwalrus[m]> My problem with that ended up being that it's impossible to interpret literature as axioms without additional logical frameworks, meaning it's simply not possible.

[14:51:03] <flaminwalrus[m]> In fairness, the 2000 or 500 year history of persons far better informed and smarter than any of us hashing out these issues do lend conventional interpretation a great deal of weight.
[14:52:09] <flaminwalrus[m]> I've come to view conventional interpretation similarly to how I would a well-established body of scientific research, I suppose. A default assumption to be overriden only in the face of most compelling evidence.

[15:23:37] <flaminwalrus[m]> And, if 'listening to the preacher drone on' is one's outlook on services, it's a sign to look for a different church. There are some, unfortunately rare, pastors that are able to deliver genuinely interesting messages on portions of scripture. Much of the best teaching occurs in small group sessions, which can be a bit more topic-focused. For example, I had a really great youth pastor in high school who did a 9 month series through

[15:58:15] <crundar> parsnip, thanks. I expect it's due to something local to my emacs installation and deployment. Now that these shadowings exist, what's the right way for me to resolve them?

[16:03:11] <parsnip> how did you install Emacs?
[16:03:42] <parsnip> i'm surprised that packages in straight.el would shadow packages in emacs install
[16:04:02] <parsnip> can you give an example?
[16:04:34] <parsnip> it's as if straight.el is installing packages in Emacs source code
[16:05:35] <crundar> parsnip, an example would be `/Users/me/.emacs.d/straight/build/org/ob-emacs-lisp hides /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/lisp/org/ob-emacs-lisp`. I don't actually know enough about how a typical emacs setup is laid out or what's where, so I'm not sure the/if problem
[16:05:37] <parsnip> did you recently upgrade emacs?
[16:06:10] <parsnip> oh, org-mode is a frequent issue
[16:06:16] <parsnip> any others besides org?
[16:06:31] <parsnip> let me rephrase
[16:06:56] <crundar> At one point in 2021, I had to deal with a homebrew issue. I couldn't install cask-emacs because emacs was already installed as a cask dependency. `brew uninstall cask; brew uninstall emacs; brew install --cask emacs; brew install cask`. Obviously.
[16:07:01] <parsnip> org-mode frequently causes issues with being installed in multiple ways. i don't have personal experience with this particular case, so the answer is not yet obvious.
[16:07:55] <crundar> parsnip, org-mode is actually the source of most of them, as it turns out. So that's useful and I didn't notice it before.
[16:09:23] <crundar> The remaining are `/Users/me/.emacs.d/straight/build/flim/sasl hides /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/lisp/net/sasl
[16:11:08] <crundar> `/faceup/faceup hides /lisp/emacs-lisp/faceup, /let-alist/let-alist hides /lisp/emacs-lisp/let-alist, /map/map hides /lisp/emacs-lisp/map and /eldoc/eldoc hides /lisp/emacs-lisp/eldoc`

[16:17:53] <parsnip> the reason i shared that repo and branch, is you could start to narrow down exactly which installs are provoking these
[16:18:09] <parsnip> that still might only be half the story though
[16:18:13] <parsnip> then again,
[16:18:25] <parsnip> maybe the issue does not reproduce on a clean install
[16:18:42] <parsnip> *install of straight.el packages
[16:21:06] <crundar> Ah. And I also said incorrectly that those were the remaining ones. Those were the remaining ones where straight shadowed a `./Contents/Resources/lisp/` version of the same.
[16:21:26] <crundar> I have some straight/straight shadowings that may be easier to diagnose: `straight/build/simple-httpd/web-server-status-codes hides straight/build/web-server/web-server-status-codes, straight/build/simple-httpd/web-server hides straight/build/web-server/web-server, straight/build/helm-shell/helm-shell hides straight/build/helm/helm-shell,

[16:27:25] <crundar> Okay. I will do that. But to confirm, this shadowing *is* a sign of something sub-optimal in my local installation and setup, and I *should* be trying to resolve this. I.e., this isn't one of those "expected warnings" that everyone else knows to ignore.

[20:28:41] <jensen> things like literate config (with org-babel) and not using lazy loading--do they only affect startup performance (which is irrelevant if using --daemon which I assume you should) or is there an effect on performance (however little) that may be persistent for normal usage? E.g. an Emacs config with nearly 10,000 lines of configuration? Or is it simply loading an entire config in memory and the
