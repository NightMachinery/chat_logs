[02:37:18] <Earnestly> il: If you change that to: printf '%s\n' low mid best audio dialog | dmenu ... | while read -r sel; do case $sel in ...; esac; done
[02:37:35] <Earnestly> il: Then you can use dmenu's multiple selections
[02:38:27] <il> Earnestly, why would you use multiple selections for this
[02:39:08] <Earnestly> I'm not smart enough to know, as the old unix heads would say.  There may be a need for it and it's functionality not lost/wasted
[02:43:00] <il> Earnestly, %s sets the separator for printf?
[02:43:53] <emanuele6> printf '%s\n' low mid best audio dialog   is like   printf 'low\nmid\nbest\naudio\ndialog\n'
[02:44:03] <il> yes, I figured it out
[02:44:16] <emanuele6> %s is where the argument gets placed
[02:44:24] <il> ah
[02:44:35] <Earnestly> il: The shell's printf will loop over inputs (operands) if there are more than the format specifiers can satisfy
[02:44:45] <emanuele6> printf 'a %s b\n' hey    would print   a hey b
[02:49:59] <il> Earnestly, https://0x0.st/oqER.sh
[02:50:02] <il> it works
[02:50:51] <il> I don't understand what 'while read -r sel' does, I'll have to read lol
[02:51:19] <emanuele6> it runs the code between `do' and `done'
[02:51:25] <emanuele6> with $sel assigned to each of the lines
[02:51:34] <il> I know that, but what do 'read -r sel' do
[02:51:58] <emanuele6> it read a line and assigns what it read to $sel
[02:52:34] <emanuele6> # printf '%s\n' 1 2 | while read -r sel; do printf 'hello\n'; printf 'sel is now %s\n'; done
[02:52:52] <emanuele6> err, forgot to pass "$sel"
[02:52:58] <emanuele6> printf '%s\n' 1 2 | while read -r sel; do printf 'hello\n'; printf 'sel is now %s\n' "$sel"; done
[02:53:01] <il> ah
[02:53:17] <il> ah, I think I've got it
[02:53:25] <il> I haven't seen a while read loop before, intersting
[02:53:43] <emanuele6> they are very useful :^)
[02:54:52] <il> can you use a different separator than a \n for that
[02:55:04] <emanuele6> in bash you can
[02:55:14] <il> useful
[02:55:15] <emanuele6> -d '|'
[02:55:27] <il> so that -d would be a read flag
[02:55:34] <emanuele6> yep
[02:55:34] <il> while read -d 'something' ?
[02:55:40] <emanuele6> don't forget -r
[02:55:44] <il> what does -r do
[02:55:50] <emanuele6> it makes read sane
[02:56:01] <il> lol
[02:56:06] <emanuele6> the default behaviour of read is to expand \ sequences when it read
[02:56:12] <emanuele6> s/$/s/
[02:56:24] <emanuele6> so   a\\bc  would be read as a\bc
[02:56:32] <il> emanuele6, where can i read about this, i'm not finding the manpages
[02:56:36] <emanuele6> -r prevents that as makes read read as is
[02:56:50] <emanuele6> il: `help read' in bash
[02:56:53] <il> ah
[02:56:55] <il> help
[02:57:43] <emanuele6> also, you often want to run `read' with IFS=''
[02:57:55] <emanuele6> as in:   while IFS='' read -r sel
[02:58:10] <emanuele6> otherwise it will strip leading and trailing spaces
[02:58:23] <emanuele6>  e.g.  read     a       as just 'a'
[02:58:30] <emanuele6> and you may or may not want that
[02:58:38] <il> well
[02:58:49] <il> I'll try to remember that if I ever find myself in that situation lol
[02:58:55] <emanuele6> with IFS= it doesn't strip that
[02:59:41] <emanuele6> you can read a bit about it here if you want  http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/001
[03:00:16] <il> Ah, thank you, I'll read that tomorrow, time to hit the hay over here haha
[03:07:55] <il> I've remembered fold, fmt, and par for some reason today
[03:08:03] <il> while commenting that script
[03:08:14] <il> alas, I really oughta catch some zzzs, a lot of stuff to do tomorrow

[16:03:41] <portwolf> hi!
[16:05:11] <portwolf> question regarding the download location 'dialog' that pops up for me to select the folder I want to download to. I type a folder name, I see it in the list, I type <tab> to select it but then the whole line I typed disappears, and so do the proposals..
[16:05:24] <portwolf> this used to work with prev. revisions. or am I just doing it wrong?
[16:06:49] <portwolf> it seems to work with folders in my home folder, but above it does not? is that intended?
[16:11:26] <The-Compiler> portwolf: do they reappear if you tab over the ".." entry?
[16:11:57] <portwolf> The-Compiler: no, everything just disappears
[16:13:23] <portwolf> The-Compiler: but once I have reached /home/portwolf/ (typed it basically myself) I can tab through all folders available in there
[16:14:53] <portwolf> The-Compiler: but the behaviour you mentioned (re-appear after passing "..") is correct inside the home folder
[16:15:20] <portwolf> this is whining on very high levels, but it would be nice, if it would skip the ".." :) and immediately go to first list entry
[16:15:33] <The-Compiler> portwolf: I haven't really had those issues myself, but can you try the latest git master perhaps? We removed the .. entry entirely there.
[16:15:38] <The-Compiler> (just yesterday!)
[16:23:20] <portwolf> The-Compiler: oh nice, the removal I mean. No biggie, I will just wait until the next release
[16:24:12] <portwolf> makes sense to remove it, since you actually just go through folder with typing, no need for ".."
[16:24:48] <portwolf> thanks for the hard work and the great browser!
[16:24:51] <The-Compiler> new release today hopefully, at least if all goes well and I can reach my remote Mac Mini again (seems to hang somehow, just opened a ticket with the hoster)
[16:25:25] <portwolf> oh wow, right on time!
[16:25:53] <portwolf> you are renting a mac mini for your builds? :)
[16:26:11] <The-Compiler> renting for free, yeah :D

[16:26:29] <portwolf> ahh I see heheh
[16:27:54] <portwolf> well good luck with the connection - will keep an eye out for the qute update!

[16:33:06] <triallax[m]> Ooh, new release? Great. :D

[16:46:04] <The-Compiler> triallax[m]: that's not distributed as part of qutebrowser - except on macOS/Windows, but there it won't arrive before Qt 6 support either unfortnately. See https://listi.jpberlin.de/pipermail/qutebrowser-announce/2022-March/000109.html for the details
[16:46:57] <triallax[m]> I understand that it's not part of Qutebrowser, I was referring to Chromum.
