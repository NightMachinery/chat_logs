[11:21:30] <inherently> I wrote something a couple months back and I'd like to get some opinions if possible
[11:22:03] <inherently> it's about what "demo" applications to write https://inherently.xyz/blog/the-power-of-the-library-example/
[11:22:03] <mockturtle> [ The Power of the Library Example ] - inherently.xyz
[11:46:31] <mockturtle> Computers should expose their internal workings as a 6th sense [culture] (j11g) https://lobste.rs/s/c8llil
[11:48:46] <rhn> inherently: I think you don't have a hook to interest me in the beginning
[11:49:13] <rhn> if we're talking about "demo" applications, I want to know your idea of what you're demoing and what is a good/bad way to do it
[11:49:29] <rhn> in this article you jump straight to the example without touching on those points

[11:55:17] <J_A_P_H> inherently: I think a few visuals can also help to hook people... Maybe something funny that's related or maybe screenshots or something. I see what you're doing with the headlines, but is that helping the reader or would something a bit longer that helps people scan be more useful?

[12:10:26] <inherently> rhn: I thought the intro was fine enough as a hook and preamble to the rest of it. what would you change about it?
[12:12:36] <inherently> J_A_P_H: I use the headings both for organization and have the ToC in the beginning so someone can jump to a specific point
[12:15:16] <inherently> admittedly the ToC is more important in stuff like a long tutorial https://inherently.xyz/tutorials/dockerstuff/ than the relatively tiny blog posts
[12:15:16] <mockturtle> [ Docker ] - inherently.xyz
[12:16:53] <inherently> as for visuals I kept the site image-free mostly on purpose apart from the favicon stuff
[12:24:06] <rhn> I don't mind the intro, it's okay. if you want to change it, then I would remove "a variety of reasons" and turn it into a section before the example

[19:28:43] <cwup74> i've been contemplating setting up my own news server because... well, i always wanted to, but it was prohibitively expensive 20 years ago while you can have a text-only full feed on a 5€ VPS these days
[19:31:57] <cwup74> however... setting up another tiny NNTP server wouldn't really provide anything that's not already available

[21:58:26] <misschif> thank gawd

[21:58:39] <misschif> humans, hello
[21:58:43] <shapr> o hi misschif, how you doin?
[21:59:02] <misschif> good, just poking around, heard of lobsters from a friend, you?
[21:59:34] <shapr> I'm reading up on minikanren for this week's reading group
[21:59:55] <shapr> I'm trying to understand what's so good about embedding backtracking search in a programming language
[22:00:15] <misschif> just googled that, looks.. cool
[22:00:55] <riv> Kaitai rules
[22:02:17] <shapr> riv: how does it compare to flatbuffers or cap'n'proto?
[22:03:55] <Church> Reminds me I need to go futz with bincode
[22:04:19] <riv> oh im not really sure, i haven't compared it

[22:05:34] <riv> wow I just saw that O(log(n!)) = O(n*log(n))
[22:05:50] <riv> I had never noticed that before, that makes more sense about why it's the best runtime for a sorting alg

[22:10:06] <riv> shapr, I think the original idea was not just backtracking search but the idea that the programming language would kinda just figure out what you want and solve the problem
[22:10:21] <riv> prolog and mk don't get there, and they kind of warped into something else - but it's a very cool concept
[22:10:53] <riv> the implementation detail of backtracking became part of the programming style
