[02:58:26] <krux02> this genderdiscussion is something that acutally annoys me. Why, because I always ignored it. I thought it couln't be that bad, some people on twitter and other toxic media have a fight about gender, let them have it. And now they actually changed the german language on public tv and radio stations, always saying weird "gender neutral forms" of words that they came up with that I don't think are part of the language.
[02:58:31] <technomancy> especially in a situation like a FOSS IRC channel where historically people said "you guys" not because it's gender neutral, but just because there were literally no women present
[02:58:48] <Bayes> well sorry sm if you felt excluded by me using the you guys

[03:03:08] <parsnip> 1. is that word so important to you that you must hang on to it?
[03:03:33] <parsnip> 2. it is entirely not uncommon for words to fall out of fashion, for example, the various descriptions of "restroom" over the years

[03:04:02] <krux02> pisspot
[03:04:27] <krux02> but that is not the problem. I have no problem with language change.
[03:04:51] <parsnip> words come to be associated with negative meaning
[03:05:12] <krux02> Every subculture has their own "language" in the form of they use their own set of identifier words. People who use those words are part of the group.
[03:05:17] <parsnip> i think alt right tried to appropriate the "ok" hand sign
[03:05:29] <parsnip> which is awkward because they use it in NBA for three pointer
[03:05:31] <krux02> one example would be "homie".

[04:39:33] <bpalmer> Languages that are only officially present in a single country may be more apt, because what matters is the government and education systems paying attention. Thus, I would expect Norwegian to be more controlled than German to be more controlled than Spanish or English.

[05:16:56] <technomancy> lol
[05:16:59] <technomancy> what happened?
[05:17:03] <TDT> As in recently, meant this morning.  Taken a bit back by all that apparently happened there and the fork from the old server.

[05:17:57] <TDT> Well, something about logging in through some kinda provider, not sure what that was about.  Did some reading on hackernews about freenode in general, and it sounds like it got bought out, and then taken over from existing leadership or something to that effect.
[05:18:27] <TDT> I guess freenode, itself, is entirely dead.  Once I verified emacs moved over (checking the FAQ), I didn't go much further with freenode.

[05:26:33] <twb> bpalmer: norwegian has two separate standards
[05:26:45] <twb> one for city folk and one for farmers
[05:27:43] <technomancy> rudybot: Would you like to upgrade to Norwegian Pro?
[05:27:54] <rudybot> technomancy: got a problem with emacs and norwegian keyboard I can't resolve: Been using a combination of iTerm2, macbook (from 2009) and emacs for years. Bought a new MacBook Pro, installed iterm2 and emacs, but norwegian character won't work in emacs, different command are run instead of input of the characters. The funny thing is that this works fine with the bultin Terminal in OS X - it's only in iTerm2 I have this problem

[12:36:05] <wasamasa> yes
[12:36:22] <wasamasa> emacs itself just blazes forward
[12:36:35] <wasamasa> so I can understand that attitude
[12:36:37] <bpalmer> E.g., the time-convert problem is foreseeable; it will help in future issues, maybe, but it causes a problem for packages that want to deal with older versions.
[12:36:47] <wasamasa> of just using the latest and greatest version available on your OS
[12:37:02] <wasamasa> to this day you still cannot fix all compilation warnings
[12:37:12] <bpalmer> but you have what people pointed out is new in emacs 28 , where they use &rest in interactive to specify a list of modes that the command should be available in M-x for
[12:37:51] <wasamasa> that seems like a pretty bad idea
[12:37:53] <bpalmer> I'd put money that will eventually be a pain for some new functionality that could be placed in interactive.
[12:38:01] <wasamasa> because using declare was considered too much
[12:38:16] <wasamasa> and you'll break compatibility hard in packages making use of this
[12:38:16] <bpalmer> Or just using put 
[12:38:26] <wasamasa> right, put would be the even less involved thing
[12:38:39] <bpalmer> (Instead, you can use put *or* you can use interactive; so now there's also the issue of: what if you do both?)
[12:38:55] <wasamasa> oh, so you can use put
[12:39:01] <wasamasa> that at least makes compatibility easier

[14:48:48] <codingquark> If I give a user some bonus money with an expiry date, how should I handle it such that things do not go bad when I show/update their ledgers? Here is a scenario: I gave user 500 coins for 2 days and has 200 coins without any expiry condition. On the first day, they use 50 coins 3 times totalling to 150 coins spent. Now, suppose the bonus is about to expire in 1 second, and the user requests to spend the remaining coins (550). If I
[14:48:48] <codingquark> setup a cron job to expire every user’s coins, it may take more than a second within which the user’s ledger will show enough coins (550) available which is wrong because the cron job is late. How do people handle this in practice?
[14:50:02] <codingquark> There are so many cases here, but the core problem is that of a mechanism to handle the expired coins.
[14:51:36] <waerloga> locking, and it's a race to see who locks the coins first, your user grabbing the coins, or the cron job making them go poof
[14:51:43] *** Joins: jatt (~user@user/jatt)
[14:52:26] <waerloga> an interesting case is if the user has the coins locked up, but does not use them during the time the expiration cron is running, do they get extra time?
[14:54:52] <codingquark> Hmm, locking can work out if the cron job locks all the rows in one go and then goes updating things
[14:55:09] <codingquark> Performance will depend upon the number of rows to be locked in this case, right?
[14:55:19] <bpalmer> codingquark: I don't know the context, but ... what is the purpose of coins expiring?

[14:59:00] <bpalmer> codingquark: yes. So you want them to spend it in the next 3 days; do you *really* care if they spend it in 3 days vs 3 days + 1 hour?

[16:40:51] <Bayes> o_O I'm sorry but I don't follow. A model that you think is general enough to that it can be applied (to a specific setting) irrespective of the data it was training, doesn't sound too formal but I kind of get what you mean. But I don't understand the last bit, what sort of rights ?

[16:42:51] <taeaad> So the unfortunate or fortunate reality is that science should by definition be independent of data, and in this case the model is. But you have an aggregator of the data, with their own products, that would 1) be a partner of some kind or 2) just be a client.
[16:44:02] <taeaad> I think that parts of the model would become free and open sourced, but many people may insist to have "access to the code" while it makes more sense to just "open source the science".
[16:44:40] *** Joins: kiki_lamb (~kiki_lamb@198-91-209-245.cpe.distributel.net)
[16:44:55] <taeaad> Data makes the model better, but the data is fungible. Whether you build the model starting at dataset X or at dataset Y, it doesn't matter that much. And the aggregator has dataset X.
[16:45:45] <Bayes> yeah I think you want to open source the model so that the model is as public as possible, businesses could try and make their own implementation if they feel like it, then you can consult to business for a ehem modicum fee to get you funded
[16:45:47] <taeaad> Going after dataset Y wouldn't be the ideal option since that constitutes being a dick.
[16:46:21] <Bayes> Whether you build the model starting at dataset X or at dataset Y > while ideally that's true, truth is data is a huge business asset and it's pretty hard to come by
[16:46:48] <Bayes> so idk how much you can claim that two datasets X, Y are interchangable in real life

[16:47:44] <taeaad> But this is in climate and agriculture, so the data does actually translate truly. It's not like Google's database of our secrets vs. FB's database of our secrets; climate is continuous and consistent.
[16:47:53] *** Joins: Amadiro (~Amadiro@84.209.11.12)
[16:48:18] <taeaad> So X and Y are views on a bigger kind of dataset of biology and climate.
[16:48:20] <Bayes> yeah but the ability to access those data, munge them, make them useful, interpret them, etc is not trivial
[16:48:33] <taeaad> That's my card, basically.

Key parts of the science can be FOSS, but the service itself stays intact and the people with data remain clients as any other client. So the trade-off would be that random other companies make money from a model they didn't build by virtue of connecting with the end users.
[17:39:17] <taeaad> But I think that is Microsoft's grand scheme, so nothing new. The difference is that MS never published science until about 10 years ago where the anarchists finally banged on the door with FOSS as a new social movement.

[18:22:53] <twb> grym: then you should have counts
[18:22:53] <taeaad> Or, more esoterically, you can ban the barbers, create partitions, and then a barber is an equivalence class of people. This is my research, by the way. It's a different framework for set theory based on a functor into a category. Not my day job, but my night job after the show is over :')
[18:24:10] <grym> twb: wasteful! and inefficient! https://lwvma.org/your-government/counties/ 
[18:24:35] <taeaad> Come to think of it, I should think about whether this says anything about Russel's paradox. I'm not sure if it does (using partitions).

[18:26:24] <taeaad> So, the barber actually doesn't have to be banned. Each barber is simply in a equivalence class AND is an equivalence class. They can shave themselves if they want to, then they are simply 1) an equivalance class that 2) also contains them as a point. Otherwise, the two don't coincide.

[21:08:15] <catern> dired should have some kind of mode where you can record a macro that applies to all marked files, or something
[21:08:25] <catern> some way to do a compound action...
[21:08:39] <cvanduse`> Well, you could write a command that makes the compound action you want.
[21:09:04] <catern> I say this just because dired already has marks, which is a way to do something on a list of files, so using macros instead is wasting that ability

[23:35:28] <qhong> oof just exactly what I think
[23:35:35] <bpalmer> you can do light web/document browsing in emacs, sure.
[23:35:35] <hodapp> some pages - particularly more complex web apps - just won't work in anything but a 'full' browser engine

[23:35:55] <judybot> hodapp: house out of a $40,000 mortgage and having the owner of the house come by and say to you, "you're not allowed to make any repairs.
[23:36:20] <qhong> but I mean are the functionality they implement somehow impossible to do in emacs itself?
[23:36:26] <qhong> I'm skeptical
[23:36:32] <parsnip> to varying degrees
[23:36:43] <grym> you wanna write the DOM in lisp? have fun 
[23:37:07] <qhong> why use hTmL dom, we have org
[23:37:08] <hodapp> they're "possible", but that word "possible" is doing a lot of work
[23:37:13] <edgar-rft> qhong: not impossible but Emacs lisp is a *lot* slower than natively compiled binary code
[23:37:14] <qhong> Also maybe u mean Elisp
[23:37:24] <parsnip> imagine trying to log into your bank's web UI with emacs
[23:37:27] <qhong> There's lots of dom library in CL already
[23:37:33] <bpalmer> qhong: emacs runs in terminals as well as various graphical display systems, so the first step to resolving your skepticism is whether everything can be done in a generic terminal
[23:37:39] *** Quits: srhm (~srhm@user/srhm) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[23:37:41] <qhong> not necessarily web UI
[23:37:43] <parsnip> qhong: i think they meant the term "lisp" more generally
[23:37:54] <hodapp> if "possible" means you'd have to reimplement substantial parts of a browser engine, that's kinda useless
[23:37:56] <qhong> imagine your bank UI is in org mode
[23:37:58] <parsnip> "lisp" doesn't always imply "common lisp"
[23:38:11] <bpalmer> qhong: if you decide that it doesn't need to run in every environment that emacs runs in (perhaps graphical css should only be interpreted in a graphical mode), then it's a matter of defining what environments it does have to run in.
[23:38:15] <bremner> parsnip: get yer own troll lines!
[23:38:22] <qhong> then it's totally reasonable to manipulate dom in lisp
[23:38:54] <hodapp> for some of the more complex pages it's not just DOM but that you'd also need to handle CSS and have a good JavaScript runtime built in
[23:38:55] <bpalmer> manipulating doms in lisp is straightforward enough; org has an api for its dom, basically (although somewhat awkward)
