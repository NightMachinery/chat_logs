[00:56:00] <hpc> self-hosted is better anyway
[00:58:46] <dminuoso> hpc: Hard to say, means we have to constantly update it, deal with all the quirky performance behaviors..
[01:00:31] <hpc> just don't let it on the internet
[01:00:43] <hpc> in fact, don't let it on the lan either, some of those boxes might be on the internet
[01:00:46] <hpc> in fact, don't even turn it on
[01:00:56] <dminuoso> We want it on the internet.
[01:01:04] <hpc> :P
[01:01:28] <hpc> for wfh?
[01:02:42] <dminuoso> We do provide some open source stuff and it's much easier for collaboration with other companies.
[01:02:59] <dminuoso> The latter could also be solved by a lot of VPNery

[01:04:15] <dminuoso> Given that we're an ISP, there's just no alternative honestly

[06:18:47] <abastro[m]> I wonder how hard time typical people have on understanding (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2
[06:22:27] <abastro[m]> > (<>) <$> [a, b] <*> [a, b]
[06:22:28] <lambdabot>  [a <> a,a <> b,b <> a,b <> b]
[06:22:47] <abastro[m]> Interesting, that works
[06:24:31] <abastro[m]> > traverse (const [a, b]) [1..3]
[06:24:33] <lambdabot>  [[a,a,a],[a,a,b],[a,b,a],[a,b,b],[b,a,a],[b,a,b],[b,b,a],[b,b,b]]
[06:33:29] <abastro[m]> How hard was it for you to learn those identities?
[07:16:00] <energizer> it is somemtimes easier to understand than to remember
[07:17:25] <energizer> "(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2" is really about distributivity: (a + b)(a + b) = (a + b)a + (a + b)b
[07:21:09] <abastro[m]> I mean, how hard is it to *understand* it?
[07:21:37] <abastro[m]> Applying distributive law might be intuitive to some but incredibly obscure for others
[07:31:14] <abastro[m]> I.e. Math is hard

[09:23:47] <ongy[m]> ehh, Maths really isn't that hard. Neither are most other topics. It's really a question of whether people are interested. I can't get the rhyme rules in my head. Becuase I don't care for them at all. And they are simpler than the 3 binomial formulas, let's be real

[12:22:17] <abastro[m]> I've seen many people who can't wrap head around the binomial formula. They could memorize it, but cannot understand it.
[12:25:31] <parsnip> what does understanding it mean?
[12:26:17] <ongy[m]> How to recover them/prove them
[12:27:51] <parsnip> everyone seems to have a different threshold for where they think understanding "why" will help them, in each topic
[12:28:25] <parsnip> i don't particularly want to study shakespeare to help me understand the world
[12:33:44] <abastro[m]> Well, by understanding I meant that
[12:34:50] <abastro[m]> They will have hard time calculating/comprehending
[12:34:50] <abastro[m]> (a + b)^2 = a (a + b) + b (a + b) = a^2 + ab + ba + b^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2
[12:35:46] <abastro[m]> Also failing to connect this with the laws
[12:46:19] <[exa]> abastro[m]: understanding stuff cannot be technically proven, different people may see completely different background even in the binomial formulas and nevertheless use them successfully in the same situations
[12:47:27] <abastro[m]> What do you mean by ''completely different background yet use them successfully"?
[12:47:55] <[exa]> I'd say the distributivity trick isn't at all the core of binomial formulas, I like to think about it more like multidimensional cubes and inclusion/exclusion principle, which is much more guiding in many situations
[12:48:25] <parsnip> "I think I can safely say that nobody really understands quantum mechanics"
[12:48:39] <[exa]> as in, you can learn to manipulate symbolic equations and logic, but that makes you a prolog not a mathematician
[12:49:33] <[exa]> s/prolog/wolfram alpha/ depending on situation
[12:59:42] <ongy[m]> which is vastly more useful to almost 100% of the world's population than being a mathematician

[13:16:25] <abastro[m]> However you put, at the end it is about building a mental model for it
[13:18:04] <abastro[m]> However for some, calculating (a+b)^2 or (a+b)(a-b) or similar would be intrinsically hard no matter how much effort they put in - perhal

[13:21:08] <parsnip> i imagine a significant percentage of people on IRC are able to apply distribution

[13:21:33] <parsnip> isn't it just x * (y + z) x * y + x * z?
[13:22:00] <abastro[m]> That is never obvious for vast majority of people, even for IRC users I think
[13:22:12] <abastro[m]> Well, haskell users would be able to ofc
[13:22:31] <parsnip> i said "significant percentage", not necessarily vast majority
[13:22:33] <abastro[m]> As haskell programmers deal with similar aspect daily
[13:22:49] <abastro[m]> Oh, how much do you mean by significant percentage
[13:22:57] <abastro[m]> Oh wait
[13:23:27] <abastro[m]> I mean, majority of IRC people would not be able to apply the distributive law.
[13:23:28] <parsnip> typo
[13:23:32] <parsnip> x * (y + z) = x * y + x * z

[13:25:06] <river> its just two different ways to find the area of two joined rectangles: x|_y_|__z__|
[13:25:08] <parsnip> i mean, a lot of people who studied programming or science in college, probably are comfortable with distribution
[13:25:24] <abastro[m]> Hm yea, probably with science
[13:25:35] <abastro[m]> I'm not sure with programming
[13:25:45] <parsnip> if you just take math in high school, you might learn it and forget it
[13:26:00] <parsnip> if you learn programming on your own, you might not bother to learn much math

[13:26:57] <parsnip> that's an interesting concept to discuss
[13:27:13] <parsnip> *you said something like that
[13:27:17] <abastro[m]> Yep
[13:27:33] <parsnip> i think quite a few people are capable
[13:27:41] <abastro[m]> Meh guess I misinterpreted your word
[13:27:43] <abastro[m]> Uhm wait
[13:27:44] <parsnip> i would wager, almost everyone on IRC is capable
[13:27:48] <abastro[m]> I did not, I think
[13:28:02] <abastro[m]> Hm actually, I may not know of IRC enough
[13:28:39] <abastro[m]> I think it was a popular enough platform for chatting platform, so that people who just do some games chat on it
[13:28:40] <parsnip> i just mean, the sort of person who bothers to get on IRC, today, probably would be capable of learning distribution, if they put in the effort
[13:28:48] <abastro[m]> Perhaps I am wrong about that
[13:28:50] <abastro[m]> Ohh
[13:28:53] <abastro[m]> Well
[13:29:12] <abastro[m]> Wouldn't the two be different skills?
[13:29:20] <abastro[m]> With IRC you could even use web client
[13:29:29] <parsnip> yes, but i claim correlation
[13:29:34] <parsnip> odds
[13:29:40] <abastro[m]> And there are lots of step-by-step tutorials
[13:29:46] <abastro[m]> So people have less problem with them
[13:29:47] * ongy[m] gets on irc via matrix which is the same amount of effort as other stuff. Like discord et. al
[13:30:15] <abastro[m]> Tho with distributive laws, it at least require understanding distributive law & formulations
[13:30:17] <parsnip> ongy: are you capable of learning about distribution, given the effort?
[13:30:20] <abastro[m]> Oh right, I am also through matrix
[13:30:36] <abastro[m]> Well haskell IRC is going to be poor metric of entirety of IRC
[13:30:36] <parsnip> it's not quite trivial to get on IRC through matrix
[13:30:42] <parsnip> most people i know wouldn't bother

[13:31:12] <abastro[m]> I know of some gamers who used irc
[13:31:29] <parsnip> anyways, how do you know so many are incapable of learning distribution?
[13:31:47] <parsnip> we all have pretty common brains
[13:31:52] <[exa]> abastro[m]: not all people decide to learn the algebraic logic just as they decide to omit learning hochdeutsch; is that a problem?
[13:32:04] <abastro[m]> Well I observed that pretty often in common populace
[13:32:18] <parsnip> how did you observe that they were incapable?
[13:32:30] <abastro[m]> Saw it in firsthand
[13:32:37] <parsnip> because they expressed frustration?
[13:32:44] <abastro[m]> I also tried to teach them, yet failed
[13:32:44] <parsnip> because they didn't know it yet?
[13:32:49] <parsnip> because you tried to teach them?
[13:32:53] <parsnip> ah
[13:32:54] <abastro[m]> No they showed genuine interest
[13:33:02] <abastro[m]> Yet it was too hard for them
[13:33:03] <[exa]> teaching is hard™
[13:33:05] <parsnip> well, i have epxerience tutoring
[13:33:10] <parsnip> *experience
[13:33:18] <parsnip> yes
[13:33:22] <parsnip> teaching is hard
[13:33:53] <abastro[m]> Well to be honest the student was going for music school, but she needed tutoring to pass a math exam.
[13:34:13] <parsnip> effort
[13:34:14] <abastro[m]> It was crucial for her, yet it was hard
[13:34:23] <parsnip> practice, etc
[13:34:26] <abastro[m]> No no, took like weeks
[13:34:38] <abastro[m]> Still did not understand
[13:34:38] <[exa]> like, people who are used to imagine stuff as interacting cubes and use it as default have their lives with current algebra a bit easier than if they work with general arts etc
[13:34:42] <parsnip> well, that's also a small sample size, ignoring the specifics of events
[13:35:02] <abastro[m]> Yea, but I can see many similar people
[13:35:02] <[exa]> hitting the right representation for a given user is the hard part of teaching

[13:38:15] <parsnip> that is presented much more precisely in logic than in math
[13:38:16] <ongy[m]> I'm not really a logicians. I just went to a good university for CS education
[13:38:37] <parsnip> i took a brief logic class, and my mind exploded at how precise they were about that
[13:39:12] <ongy[m]> I took one in formal computer checked proofs. which I consider the one where I learned most about logic/in depth math and deconstruction of things that "just are"

[14:49:59] <abastro[m]> Well
[14:51:41] <abastro[m]> I can definitely say that I've seen many people (not engineering background) who failed at understanding these algebra
[14:54:38] <abastro[m]> How much exposure did you guys have on non-engineering bg ppl?
[15:20:14] <parsnip> how often do we meet people who don't have a bg in engineering?
[15:20:33] <parsnip> in normal life? in tutoring? in talking about math?
[15:21:12] <parsnip> i generally do not encounter people and thing, "oh, you don't know how the distributive property?"
[15:22:04] <parsnip> i've tutored people of many backgrounds
[15:22:43] <parsnip> little kids, adults, med students, older adults working on their GED
[15:24:23] <parsnip> i think i helped an adult in a college tutor room, with something like adding numbers, carrying, and i treated them like a human being, and i remember thinking how easily a tutor might fall into a trap of treating them badly
[15:24:25] <abastro[m]> High school students having to learn math, where they chose music/art because they are unable at math?
[15:25:08] <abastro[m]> Or more commonly, humanities subjects
[15:25:24] <abastro[m]> Those who are rather better at language skills than math
[15:25:34] <parsnip> to be honest, very early in my tutoring experience, i told someone i thought they shouldn't study physics. i regret that. i would rather have looked at it as i was frustrated with trying to explain things.
[15:26:24] <parsnip> unable?
[15:26:44] <parsnip> i generally think that's a dangerous assumption
[15:27:01] <abastro[m]> Well, I did say that because I and many others tried for a while
[15:27:04] <abastro[m]> And then failed
[15:27:13] <abastro[m]> Not that I will assume that upfront.
[15:27:30] <parsnip> well, if that's really the case, then it should be handled very carefully, in my opinion
[15:27:34] <abastro[m]> I now understand that human beings are different and unique.
[15:27:45] <abastro[m]> Not everyone are alike
[15:27:49] <parsnip> you run the risk of being wrong, so might as well be cautious about it
[15:28:01] <parsnip> yes, that is not obvious sometimes
[15:28:14] <abastro[m]> So it is dangerous to assume that if something is easy for you, it would be also easy for others
[15:28:14] <parsnip> i think earlier in my life, i thought everything was capable of everything
[15:28:39] <parsnip> but saying they're "incapable" might not be the best way
[15:28:44] <abastro[m]> Or if you can do something, others can do as well.
[15:28:48] <parsnip> maybe a better way to think of it is,
[15:28:51] <abastro[m]> Capability depends.
[15:29:07] <parsnip> i don't think it's an on/off switch
[15:29:20] <parsnip> everyone finds various topics easier or harder than the next person
[15:29:29] <abastro[m]> It's a spectrum, where actually lots of people are leaning towards "incapable'
[15:29:44] <parsnip> so, it might not be practical for everyone to be a mathematician, because it's hard, and we don't need that many, presumably
[15:30:08] <kuribas> I wished I studied math instead of music.
[15:30:17] <ongy[m]> https://www.reddit.com/r/mathmemes/comments/toizch/i_legit_did_this_in_a_math_test_and_now_i_cant/ for the earlier discussion

[15:30:44] <kuribas> I found most I learned in music did not come from the institutions, but from individuals I met later.
[15:30:58] <parsnip> you're taking on a huge responsibility if you decide to be the person that determines someone shouldn't do a thing
[15:31:47] <abastro[m]> Well, I don't mean I decide they do
[15:31:57] <abastro[m]> I guess it was rather that they did
[15:32:01] <abastro[m]> And I understood it
[15:32:26] <abastro[m]> It's not like mathematical instinct is common for everyone
[15:32:28] <parsnip> sure, hopefully we are patient, and allow the other person to decide when they'd like to put the task away
[15:33:19] <parsnip> "is this worth the effort to you right now?"
[15:33:33] <parsnip> "if so, i will patiently help if you want help"
[15:34:03] <parsnip> they may want to temporarily put it away
[15:34:10] <abastro[m]> Or eternally
[15:34:23] <parsnip> maybe they try again when circumstances change
[15:34:54] <abastro[m]> Thing is, there is no reason or intention for them to do so
[15:35:09] <parsnip> oh, why were they taking it? was it not a requirement for some other goal?
[15:35:20] <abastro[m]> Also it's more like.. they established to themselves that they cannot understand
[15:35:39] <parsnip> i had a lot of med students getting help in physics
[15:35:40] <abastro[m]> Yep, it was requirement but they decided it was not possible
[15:35:47] <abastro[m]> Med students? Like medical?
[15:35:51] <parsnip> yes
[15:36:00] <abastro[m]> Those are usually fine at mathematics

[15:43:22] <abastro[m]> <del>I consider myself to be disabled with certain skills</del>
[15:44:38] <geekosaur> whether it's justified is another question
[15:45:21] <geekosaur> Ispent years strongly distrusting my math skills for reasons that were more situational than actual problems with my ability to do math
[15:45:54] <geekosaur> I *think* I've mostly gotten past that, but I'mstill missing quite a bit of math background as a result
[15:46:51] <abastro[m]> Interesting!
[15:47:17] <abastro[m]> Could you tell me more about your experience with math? Did you initially avoided it?
[15:49:07] <geekosaur> no
[15:49:25] <geekosaur> so, for background, I'm autistic. and no, I do not mean Aspie
[15:50:57] <geekosaur> the school system I started out in didn't handle anyone who wasn't "normal" very well,so I spent the first year and a half of school in a "special needs" class which had everyone from DD kids to someone with muscular dystrophy
[15:51:20] <geekosaur> and zero actuallearning. basically daycare for anyone they didn;t want to have to think about
[15:51:27] <abastro[m]> Oh noo
[15:52:41] <geekosaur> middle of second grade my parents finally got me into a regular school… straight into long division. for years I distrusted my ability to multiply because I got no schooling in it, or the chane to memorize multiplication tablesor etc.
[15:56:00] <geekosaur> this then got reinforced later: while I distrusted myself at math, I was pretty good at science, and the school system we moved into later (mostly because my parents were still pissed at the W-E system) noticed and jumped me forward a year in sciences
[15:56:07] <abastro[m]> Could vaguely imagine your struggle.. sad
[15:56:32] <geekosaur> then I spent half days my senior year at CWRU, but the only class I could reasonably schedule was an acceleratedcalc course
[15:56:58] <geekosaur> which was just a bit too fast for a high schooler, especially as the year went on and I was trying to get ready for graduation
[15:57:50] <geekosaur> did okay on the midterm (which would have been calc I final for the normalcourse), kinda crashed out of the final :(
[16:00:32] <abastro[m]> Ouch
[16:07:08] <abastro[m]> Sorry for making you remind of the painful bits..
[16:07:08] <abastro[m]> Are you able to get a bit friendly with the math later?
[16:08:41] <geekosaur> somewhat, yes
[16:11:27] <geekosaur> mostly I'm annoyed at how I was more or less forced to miss so much, and I'm still trying to catch up now
[16:11:58] <abastro[m]> Yep, I am sad on the current state of education
[16:23:55] <abastro[m]> Btw what is different between auti and aspie? Aren't they like  two naming of the same tendency
[16:30:05] <geekosaur> aspie's the low end. I'm kinda not low end
[16:30:39] <geekosaur> flip side I do tend to come across as "super-Aspie"
[16:35:14] <geekosaur> was talking with mytherapist yesterday, and I commented at one point that autism is currently described as a spectrum,but I feel like even that is too simplistic; it's at least two dimensional
[16:35:51] <river> when people say spectrum they really mean continuum
[16:36:20] <river> an actual spectrum would be more like http://www.pixelsham.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/aluminum-argon-calcium-carbon-helium-hydrogen-iron-krypton-magnesium-neon-nitrogen_orig.jpg
[16:36:38] <hpc> um actually, it's a vector field :P
[16:36:44] <river> but what people really mean is "somewhere between 0% autism and 100% autism"
[16:37:06] <carbolymer> are you quantising asperger field?

[17:29:58] <geekosaur> depression meds, yes (but that's still a harum-scarum field)
[17:30:12] <geekosaur> I have sensory issues that are only partially treatable
[17:30:24] <abastro[m]> Sensory issues?
[17:30:40] <ongy[m]> anti-depression meds got me from "why am I doing this" to "this is ok", never (or at least not since teenage years) felt the "live is great" that some people tend to propagate so often

[17:33:11] <geekosaur> abastro[m], I go into sensory overload very easily, and my brain starts to shut down to limit the sensory input
[17:33:37] <abastro[m]> Oh I see. I wonder if similar things happen in my brain as well.
[17:34:23] <abastro[m]> Sometimes when I hear lots of insults on me, my mind just halts.
[17:34:50] <Lycurgus> from voices in ur head?
[17:35:29] <Lycurgus> or actual comments which you take that way?
[17:35:53] <ongy[m]> I wish my brain shut down when I overload tbh. Though it's not necessarily sensory for me, but more the social anxiety part that then drives me crazy
[17:36:29] <Lycurgus> having a though is not commonly expressed in english as hearing a voice except by explicit metaphor
[17:36:37] <Lycurgus> *thought
[17:36:46] <abastro[m]> From actual comments
[17:36:54] <Lycurgus> ah
[17:37:11] <abastro[m]> Yea otherwise it won't be sensory
[17:37:22] <geekosaur> yeh, that may be more just social anxiety
[17:37:28] <Lycurgus> you'd be in schizo territory
[17:37:51] <Lycurgus> (if the voice aint you)
[17:38:21] <abastro[m]> I hate how I just cannot shrug off and act forward when people tease me, and that causes people to dismiss/insult me harder
[17:38:33] <geekosaur> I've had tunnel vision set in, not because of social triggers (nobody else was around),just because the light was too bright for me
[17:38:59] <geekosaur> light and sound are the usual triggers in my case
[17:39:40] * Lycurgus had a delusion of telepathy, except i'm not sure it's a delusion if you think it might be
[17:39:42] <kuribas> did you try standing meditation?
[17:40:11] <abastro[m]> Oh, those kind of sensory overload is also a bit relatable - but it is relatively uncommon for me
[17:40:32] <kuribas> The problem is that often the brain is considered separate from the rest of your body.
[17:40:35] <geekosaur> it's very common for me
[17:40:50] <kuribas> But the body and mind energy are connected.
[17:40:56] <Lycurgus> which is an issue in phil
[17:41:11] <Lycurgus> an brain crap is all the rage
[17:41:11] <kuribas> So to make the "mind" ease down, you need to easy down the body as well.
[17:41:27] <Lycurgus> like the thing on bbc imaging kindness
[17:41:43] <Lycurgus> like humongs just discovered they brains
[17:42:53] <Lycurgus> i this time, when religion is still a really big thing, psychosis and delusion are the norm not the exception
[17:43:08] <abastro[m]> Is it annoying to have such a sensory overload? Or does it feel more serious
[17:43:40] <kuribas> abastro[m]: it's about managing impulses.  You cannot control impulses, but you can control how you react on them.
[17:43:57] <kuribas> abastro[m]: someone teases you => impulse reaction.
[17:43:59] <Lycurgus> human beings don't become fully rational till later igess, after I'm dead
[17:44:05] <geekosaur> abastro[m], it pretty much stopsme from doing anything
[17:44:43] <Lycurgus> you can't see teasing as an attempt to be friendly?
[17:45:09] <abastro[m]> Oh.. halts
[17:45:13] <Lycurgus> sfaik, except for children, that's what it uniformly is among adults
[17:45:37] <kuribas> Lycurgus: not always :(
[17:45:38] <geekosaur> Lycurgus, was that supposed to be aimed at me? [26 13:08:32] <geekosaur> I've had tunnel vision set in, not because of social triggers (nobody else was around),just because the light was too bright for me
[17:45:41] <abastro[m]> My first language is not English, so I chose the wrong word
[17:45:43] <kuribas> There are toxic environments.
[17:45:59] <abastro[m]> I meant actual insults
[17:46:13] <kuribas> But in such case you should try to simply avoid them.  Find better friends/colleages/...
[17:46:35] <abastro[m]> Like "imagine being that r*arded, such ppl do not deserve lives"
[17:47:15] <abastro[m]> Well it happened when I was in high school, which was small enough that such an attitude was universal
[17:47:28] <kuribas> abastro[m]: best way to deal with insults is to relax physically, then focus on the other person.
[17:47:29] <Lycurgus> 13:07:28 is what I have after your noted line geekosaur, and no that was for abastro[m] hearing voices
[17:47:35] <kuribas> abastro[m]: don't let it be about yourself.

[17:47:58] <kuribas> abastro[m]: think about, why does this person feel the need to insult you?
[17:47:59] <abastro[m]> Had a few friends, but still, having majority doing that to me was quite unbearable
[17:48:20] <kuribas> Or it could be that they aren't insulting you, but you just feel it that way.
[17:48:28] <abastro[m]> IIRC it's partly because they are stressed themselves so they needed someone to belittle
[17:48:48] <Lycurgus> the thing about telepathy was just me chiming in with my experience
[17:49:34] <abastro[m]> Plus, they perhaps did not like someone outside their inner circle being a competitor
[17:49:58] <kuribas>  abastro[m]: you're conjecturing now.
[17:49:59] <abastro[m]> You know, high school is often competitive environment
[17:50:21] <abastro[m]> Well, I have some evidence on this
[17:50:24] <Lycurgus> and ur still a child in high school
[17:50:37] <abastro[m]> Well yep I need to grow up from this
[17:51:09] <kuribas> oh well, high school is different.  Kids are just mean.
[17:51:23] <abastro[m]> Yep, kids.
[17:51:49] <abastro[m]> Still, it was like 3~4 years ago, so I guess it needs more time to stop thinking about it
[17:52:49] <kuribas> It was 25 years ago, scars are almost healing now :)
[17:53:32] <kuribas> but you know "I need to act forward" is not a good mindset.
[17:53:34] <abastro[m]> Ohh
[17:53:45] <abastro[m]> Act forward?
[17:53:59] <Lycurgus> i think the fact that you are reaching sexual maturity over saturates memory of the period
[17:54:11] <Lycurgus> or passing thru it actually
[17:54:18] <kuribas> abastro[m]: "I hate how I just cannot shrug off and act forward when people tease me, and that causes people to dismiss/insult me harder"
[17:54:27] <Lycurgus> the next to last phase of brain maturation
[17:54:44] <Lycurgus> s/matruation/development/
[17:55:30] <abastro[m]> Yep, the over-saturation honestly hurts
[17:55:49] <abastro[m]> kuribas: Oh, Hmm. What am I supposed to do then?
[17:56:03] <kuribas> abastro[m]: relax, physically.
[17:56:22] <kuribas> abastro[m]: focus on what you find important.
[17:56:55] <abastro[m]> I see! The whole life I've been living through without knowing this..
[17:57:40] <ongy[m]> the hard part is still catching yourself in the moment and actually apply that
[17:57:51] <abastro[m]> Indeed
[17:58:23] <abastro[m]> Yep, I should have rather relaxed. I guess instead I was trapped in the gloomy thoughts, wondering how to evade the situation and urging myself to "act normally"
[17:58:28] <Lycurgus> for some people high school is the high pont of their lives
[17:58:43] <Lycurgus> all downhill from there
[17:59:16] <abastro[m]> Interesting, I wonder how
[17:59:28] <abastro[m]> Sounds like opposite (hopefully) for me
[18:00:02] <Lycurgus> yes, the opposite of what you experience
[18:00:25] <Lycurgus> adulation vs ridicule
[18:01:14] <Lycurgus> when you have to make it in the adult world, there's a reshuffle of the cards

[18:07:53] <ongy[m]> yea, I didn't mind school. I was just bored, but had excess time and no worries
[18:08:00] <kuribas> but it makes sense, in high school you have so many different people, with different interests, characters.
[18:08:08] <abastro[m]> So school simply being bad
