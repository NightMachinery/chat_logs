[00:30:36] <travis_griggs> I just got to the "this is how we do generics in Zig" part. This is actually kinda cool (I generally swear when I get to <generics in C++, Swift, Kotlin, et al). It reminds me of some thought experiments Gilad Bracha once wrote about for Dart/NewSpeak. Anyone know where the inspiration to do it this way came from?

[00:59:05] <Franciman> I am not getting advantage of the fact that my stack is only accessed at the end
[00:59:22] <Franciman> I need to tweak the array_list to cache pointers near the end
[01:01:31] <viric> aliasing is so complicated... https://accu.org/journals/overload/28/160/anonymous/

[01:07:36] <ifreund> indeed :/
[01:08:52] <ifreund> Zig doesn't have a spec yet though and has the benefit of hindsight here, I expect that what we land on long term will be a good bit simpler/less footgunny
[01:08:54] <viric> I don't know rust but I guess that's something they want to do well.
[01:09:20] <ifreund> rust doesn't have a spec either but they don't have the excuse of being a pre-1.0 language
[01:10:00] <viric> maybe they do less "pointer" things
[01:10:37] <ifreund> they still have the unsafe {} escape hatch
[01:12:38] <viric> well yes; but I mean that maybe they can do more code without pointers
[01:13:05] <viric> no idea.
[01:14:27] <devast8a> They still have pointers, references really, but they explicitly avoid aliasing. You need to use specific reference types to be able to alias memory.
[01:15:14] <devast8a> I should clarify, they explicitly avoid aliasing memory that you can modify.
[01:15:51] <devast8a> They allow unlimited aliasing for immutable references.

[01:58:08] <_javyre> Ristovski: I could be wrong but it sounds like you're running into the fact that zig c++ has a different abi than whatever you're linking to that has been compiled with some other c++ compiler.

[02:04:51] <andrewrk> freshcoffee, what would be the way to install gdb in zinc/linux_base.sh? 
[02:05:28] <andrewrk> oh never mind as soon as I asked, I noticed the image is debian
[02:07:04] <travis_griggs> andrewrk thanks for the link. a bit late, but nice talk
[02:07:31] <travis_griggs> (as in, me telling you "nice talk", is a bit late)
[02:07:56] <andrewrk> I'm still here :)
[02:08:06] <andrewrk> thanks!
[02:08:16] <Ristovski> huh, works with 0.6.0 on godbolt >_>
[02:08:52] <travis_griggs> in that talk, you allude to some ideas about improved safety in certain build modes. did that pan out? or still a hope? maybe i stumble on it as i go farther through the docs?
[02:09:22] <ifreund> travis_griggs: zig has 4 build modes, debug and release-safe have improved safety
[02:09:24] <andrewrk> Ristovski, hmm I wonder how to solve that. might be worth poking around in the libc++ source files and looking at some of the #defines they use, and looking at the upstream cmakelists.txt file, and looking at zig's libcxx.zig 
[02:09:38] <ifreund> release-fast and release-small disable safety for better code generation

[02:22:44] * Ristovski will attempt to compile on his measly potato
[02:23:12] <andrewrk> not sure what was working in 0.6.0 because zig's ability to provide libc++ was only introduced as part of 0.7.0
[02:24:05] <andrewrk> or maybe I'm interpreting this wrong https://github.com/ziglang/zig/commit/877e4248fc1e8e28b1f43282411aa9868d6d1d9c
[02:25:05] <Ristovski> did I derp that hard? brb checking
[02:25:53] <travis_griggs> are there any more talks/posts where you talk about what you did in those modes to close the "safety" gap with Rust?
[02:26:43] <Ristovski> andrewrk: you're right, 0.6.0 uses mingw and msvcrt-os
[02:26:59] <andrewrk> mingw and msvcrt-os do not provide libc++
[02:27:06] <Ristovski> oh right
[02:27:14] <Ristovski> yeah it does have libcxx
[02:28:37] <andrewrk> travis_griggs, we haven't really focused on safety as a talking point yet. but we'll probably start doing that in a couple release cycles from now since it's all people coming from rust ever talk about
[02:30:03] <Ristovski> andrewrk: ok what the hell is happening here then: https://godbolt.org/z/rsxTaGv6W
[02:30:27] <Ristovski> oh the stdlib gets unused and I assume godbolt runs on windows
[02:30:27] <travis_griggs> i actually don't know rust at all. i've sort of avoided it. i suppose as I'm learning zig, to be objective, I need to douse myself in some rust as well, but the fanboi/pedantic nature of the community i see from a distance is off putting
[02:33:24] <Ristovski> andrewrk: Your commit was right, sorry for the bother - https://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/libcxx-dev/2020-July/000903.html, I blindly jumped to the conclusion it worked because I thought 0.6.0 on godbolt was linking with libcxx, my bad >_>

[02:46:18] <freshcoffee> andrewrk: yeah fyi, right now that img is just what it takes for ci, including deps but no extras. I'm following a similar pattern for qemu images. "ci/*"
[02:46:47] <freshcoffee> also debian was sort of an experiment. Which seems to work? But as always, if you feel a different distro is more suitable, let me know
[02:48:39] <andrewrk> freshcoffee, thanks - I got what I wanted which was just to temporarily install gdb to troubleshoot something, and I found the info I wanted
[02:49:05] <Franciman> wo trying to make things go in the cache is hard lol
[02:49:19] <freshcoffee> gimme the cache :)
[02:49:25] <Franciman> probaly I should add to each call_frame a pointer to the end of the stack
[02:49:29] <Franciman> so that it's kept in the cache
[02:49:34] <Franciman> and I can do nifty nifty thangs
[02:50:04] <Franciman> freshcoffee: ahah cache is the new cake
[02:52:26] <andrewrk> freshcoffee, i see what you did there :)
[02:53:55] <Franciman> andrewrk: your talk on data driven design was cool
[02:54:00] <Franciman> but now I want part 2, and part 3!
[02:54:01] <Franciman> :P
[02:54:04] <andrewrk> thank you :)
[02:54:22] <Franciman> I absolutely need to beat the haskell interpreter of my friend
[02:54:27] <Franciman> :P
[02:54:35] <freshcoffee> hahah healthy competition
[02:54:47] <Franciman> the cool thing of zig is that the interpreter is still almost comrephnsible
[02:54:53] <Franciman> I mean the haskell version is super nifty
[02:55:01] <Franciman> but zig version is not so bad! I can totally understand it
[02:55:04] <Franciman> in C++ i got lost many times
[02:55:46] <Franciman> now an important point will be implementing the garbage collector, if that is easy
[02:55:49] <Franciman> zig is the absolute winner
[02:58:19] <Franciman> the memory oddity is that with sum 100, I am 2x faster than even php
[02:58:29] <Franciman> but as soon as I scale to sum 10M
[02:58:33] <Franciman> it gets slow
[02:58:38] <Franciman> 2x slowe
[02:58:39] <Franciman> slower
[02:58:52] <Franciman> well sorry. I stop doing OT

[06:18:01] <Arnavion> I saw   https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/2206   and saw that it points out that it's not necessary since @import("string literal") can be used inside ifs to have only one evaluated, though that doesn't work for the loop case

[06:36:31] <andrewrk> Arnavion, here's something you can do:  `pub const foo = @import("foo.zig");` for each possible file inside `pub const imports = struct { ... };` then you can use `@field(imports, name)` 
[06:37:21] <andrewrk> zig wants to know all the possibly imported files though so that it can eagerly go find them and compile them when you kick off a compilation process. the language is constrained by making it possible for a fast compiler to exist
[06:37:45] <andrewrk> that's why you have to use string literals with `@import`

[10:22:26] <andrewrk> Arnavion, if you have your input pasted as a multiline string, you might find it convenient to use std.mem.tokenize or std.mem.split
[10:22:48] <andrewrk> if you look at lib/std/mem.zig there are `test` blocks underneath the functions to show how to use them
[10:23:17] <andrewrk> see also std.fs.Dir.readFileAlloc

[10:24:03] <andrewrk> you might also want to set yourself up an arena allocator instead of GPA, unless your goal is to practice not leaking memory

[10:26:17] <Arnavion> The tests do use std.mem.split (see input.StringIterator). For the main execution I want to avoid reading the whole file into memory (even though it's small enough to), hence the readUntilDelimiterOrEofAlloc-based iterator
[10:26:29] <Arnavion> And yes, I do want to catch leaking memory

[13:16:09] <chgr> Hi everyone, since the advent of code has started today, I decided to try doing it with zig this year. The first thing I tried is to create an ArrayList to store some []u8 in. Does that even work?
[13:16:28] <chgr> I tried something like this: https://pastebin.com/vb1xXCfb
[13:22:06] <Franciman> awesome chgr 
[13:22:30] <Franciman> yes it works without further ado
[13:22:52] <Franciman> are you planning to put in string literals'
[13:22:54] <Franciman> ?
[13:25:35] <dutchie> string literals are []const u8 which you can't cast to []u8 (not allowed to discard const)
[13:26:10] <chgr> Yes, maybe. I tried to put in a string literal, but that did not work. I also tried to put in the result of `try in_stream.readUntilDelimiterOrEof(&buf, '\n')`, but that also failed with an error: `error: expected type '*std.array_list.ArrayListAligned([]u8,null)', found '*const [7:0]u8'
[13:26:12] <chgr>     data.append("example");`
[13:26:20] <chgr> Oh sorry, that got messy.
[13:26:48] <Franciman> what dutchie said
[13:26:55] <dutchie> so you can either change your ArrayList to take []const u8 or if you need them mutable you'll have to create an allocator and `allocator.dupe("literal")` (but then you might have to worry about freeing it)
[13:26:55] <Franciman> is the reason why it doesn't work
[13:26:59] <Franciman> it's constness
[13:27:15] <chgr> oh, I see! thanks

[16:27:07] <tgschultz> Franciman: there's also std.time.Timer which can be used for internally for benchmarking specific sections.

[18:10:43] <viric> devast8a: right, I hoped rust went through a solution that moves away "default alising" in any pointer
[18:11:07] <Franciman> I second, chgr question, and also add, is it possible to use zig run to run the output of the build?
[18:11:16] <Franciman> or do I need to manually do zig-out/bin/program ?

[21:27:26] <travis_griggs> most language style conventions double down on snake_case or camelCase, but Zig seems to have embraced both, leveraging the difference. is that unique to zig, or borrowed from another language ecosystem i'm not familiar with?
[21:29:13] <Franciman> I think rust does it too
[21:29:26] <Franciman> CamelCase for type names
[21:29:33] <Franciman> snake_case for variables and function names
[21:29:42] <Franciman> except for builtins
