[15:42:31] <nat-418[m]> hello im working on a few plugins and would like to know if there are any best practices about binding keys within plugins
[15:42:41] <clason[m]> don't?
[15:43:06] <nat-418[m]> so i should just provide examples in the documentation?
[15:43:28] <clason[m]> vimscript uses `<plug>` mappings for this purpose; in Lua you'd just expose `yourmodule.yourfunction()`
[15:43:30] <clason[m]> yes
[15:43:41] <nat-418[m]> ok great
[15:44:07] <clason[m]> (any default binding you pick is likely to conflict with some users' other bindings.)
[15:44:19] <nat-418[m]> thats what i assumed
[15:45:12] <nat-418[m]> and what about user defined commands?
[15:45:26] <nat-418[m]> like :MyPluginDoThis
[15:46:00] <clason[m]> that's fine, I'd say
[15:46:17] <clason[m]> since the `MyPlugin` prefix kinda puts it in its own namespace

[21:31:39] <nova> to disambiguate what? 'foo.bar' and 'foo/bar' are both strings you can pass to a function perfectly fine. ['...'] would only be needed for key of a table, right?

[22:04:05] <nova> I hope I made up for it because my next program was a chess board (with no move validation) in ti-basic. then, I made a maze game with almost 20 levels. heh
[22:05:14] <bfredl> I just implemented pong on my TI-82 because I was a boring nerd.

[22:05:31] <reticuli> When I enable termguicolors in my putty terminal (need to ssh in), I find the redrawing speed crawls to a halt. Is this an issue with putty or is there perhaps some way to mitigate?
[22:05:34] <nova> oh yeah I did pong too
[22:05:55] <reticuli> I verified I'm using xterm-256color as my TERM which I believe is correct for putty

[22:11:17] <nova> reticuli, :set tgc over ssh is liable to double the throughput. if your conxion is crap, it could make it slower, but it shouldn't
[22:12:00] <nova> instead of \e[32m for green, for example, you gotta send \e[38;05;00ff00m or something like that
[22:12:09] <nova> !wk ansi escape codes
[22:12:24] <reticuli> nova: thanks, let me try that
[22:13:14] <nova> 'tgc' is just 'termguicolors'. I didn't recommend doing anything - just explaining why it may be slower
[22:13:26] <reticuli> nova: sorry, you're right... 
[22:13:38] <reticuli> nova: seems vanilla vim when I enable tgc gets rid of colors entirely
[22:13:46] <nova> maybe find a colorscheme that is compatible with 8-bit colors - like gruvbox8
[22:13:59] <reticuli> I'm using tgc in foot + neovim and it's fine locally on my linux box, just things slow to a crawl with putty...
[22:14:19] <reticuli> nova: yeah I'm using gruvbox 256 and it's fine, was just trying other colorschemes that require tgc
[22:14:29] <bfredl> tgc just changes what side of the color scheme (ctergfg/bg or guifg/bg) which is active
[22:14:40] <bfredl> the end result is entirely up to your color scheme
[22:15:07] <nova> My guess is that putty is the culprit. I've never noticed problems with 24-bit colorschemes on ssh via linux shell
[22:15:32] <reticuli> I just find it completely crazy how much slower it is, it's like I'm on a 9600 baud modem with tgc and T3 with notgc

[22:32:54] <nat-418[m]> so for lua plugins im seeing people put none of the old vimscript ceremony in the plugin/whatever.vim file
[22:33:19] <nat-418[m]> in plenary for example there is no &cpo let g:loaded_plenary blah blah
[22:33:30] <nat-418[m]> for lua plugins do we even need the plugin/whatever.vim file ?
[22:35:55] <nova> need? no, but you can. it's just optional. nvim still looks through globpath(&runtimepath, 'plugin') for *.vim files and loads them
[22:38:27] <nova> also, {rtp}/plugin/lua/**/*.lua are also loaded it seems
[22:38:40] <nova> (as lua scripts, of course)
[22:38:53] <nat-418[m]> thanks for clarifying

[22:42:48] <nova> {rtp}/lua/subdir/myscript.lua is (technically) in the runtimepath, though ;)
[22:42:49] <clason[m]> while `lua/foo.lua` files are only loaded through `require`
[22:43:11] <nova> oh. gotcha. :)
[22:43:11] <clason[m]> (basically, `lua/` is the `autoload/` of Lua)

[23:11:21] <nova> the point is just that lua is (almost completely) treated as first-class for config and (more importantly) heavy-duty plugins
[23:12:06] <nova> because vim-script is really just horrible because every time you load a vim-script it reads the file line by line and does not cache anything. lua is just much, much faster and better
[23:12:57] <nova> I think the extent of its caching is when you create a function, it stores the function as a list of strings and when you call the function, it parses each string in the list and evaluates it with some internal eval()
[23:13:17] <clason[m]> For config, it really doesn't make much difference performance wise
