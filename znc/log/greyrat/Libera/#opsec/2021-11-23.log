[01:36:41] <Joanna> Hi everyone
[01:41:12] <kveroneau> Hello Joanna.  How is your day going?
[01:49:53] <Joanna> Ok
[01:50:17] <Joanna> We had a chat bot here last night..
[01:50:50] <Joanna> A rather poorly written one at that
[01:57:23] *** Quits: genera (~Genera@user/genera) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[02:01:48] <jan6> I don't see that as a bot, myself
[02:02:36] <Joanna> It seemed to be talking about things that weren’t part of conversation
[02:02:43] <jan6> like what?
[02:03:25] <Joanna> Well when I greeted it it didn’t respond it just started talking about employment being slavery
[02:03:32] <jan6> lol
[02:03:56] <Joanna> Which is really on topic even if it’s true:)
[02:04:35] <jan6> loking back, I'd have to agree that there was only one reply, and that was the only line that made actual sense
[02:04:36] <jan6> lol
[02:04:39] <jan6> *looking
[02:04:50] <jan6> so fair enough I suppose
[02:05:10] <Joanna> Yea when I asked it what it does for a living.

[02:05:50] *** Joins: portalrat (~portalrat@user/portalrat)
[02:06:42] <Joanna> Maybe the bot has an operator that can type messages sometimes
[02:08:22] <Joanna> It’s really a waste of time for staff to be giving cloaks to people who are not part of foss community. But how can you know until they talk...
[02:16:05] <jan6> how do you know if someone is part, though
[02:16:27] <jan6> you can simply create a foss project on github, and boom, you're technically a part
[02:16:59] <jan6> and where do you draw the line, then, "yes yes, you have a project, but it's not popular enough, get better"
[02:17:42] <jan6> and then, how do you know if it's a person, or a bot under their name? nothing's preventing multiple entities from using the same name
[02:17:48] <jan6> etc
[02:18:09] <jan6> so it's easier to simply grant it to all who ask
[02:19:14] <jan6> why draw arbitrary lines of entry for no reason, adding extra work for the volounteers, for no real reason?
[02:22:05] <Joanna> There could be a probationary period before granting cloaks or needing a reference from legit user but that would just be more work.
[02:22:31] <jan6> exactly
[02:22:38] <Joanna> A lot of trolls register many accounts and wait months before using them
[02:23:16] <Joanna> The network ops can’t really know people as well as channel ops.
[02:26:55] <ilikeyou> what up peeps
[02:27:26] <Joanna> Hi ilikeyou what’s new?
[02:27:30] <jan6> exactly ;P
[02:28:04] <grobi> beep hello there !:)
[02:28:10] <jan6> beep boop
[02:28:17] <jan6> all bots are friends of jan6
[02:28:21] <Joanna> I like the way irc leaves channel moderation up to the ops
[02:28:48] <jan6> I like the way IRCOPS are rarely, if ever, seen or used
[02:28:52] <Joanna> A bot is only as good as the person who uses it :)
[02:28:57] <jan6> heh
[02:29:15] <grobi> invidual tries to hypnotize permision denied
[02:29:16] <jan6> I'm chaotic neutral-good, and my bot is more useless than I
[02:29:51] <Joanna> Oh the networks suggestion that the ops hide in channel ready to ambush trolls ?
[02:30:48] <jan6> hm?
[02:30:55] <Joanna> It’s not hard to find out who channel ops are even if they aren’t opped though
[02:31:34] <jan6> 1) to a pleb like me, it is, social engineering AKA asking "who're the ops here" doesn't count
[02:31:45] <jan6> 2) where'd that topic come from?
[02:32:12] <s1gyn> You can pull the info from chanserv
[02:33:11] <jan6> how?
[02:34:10] <jan6> info says only founder and successors, rest requires extra access?
[02:35:11] <jan6> like I can't /cs why #opsec, because "no special access"
[02:36:23] <s1gyn> I thought it was chanserv access <channame> list but that doesn't seem to work here
[02:36:44] <jan6> irc setups can vary wildly, lol
[02:37:01] <Joanna> s1gyn: flags
[02:37:23] <jan6> hm
[02:37:24] <s1gyn> ah okay
[02:37:26] <s1gyn> thanks
[02:37:51] <jan6> if you want chaos, you can check the flags of ##jan6
[02:37:51] <jan6> lol
[02:38:03] <jan6> OP EVERYOOONEEEE
[02:38:10] <ilikeyou> not much Joanna , just checking logs for a bit :)
[02:38:15] <Joanna> Freenode used access list syntax
[02:39:28] <Joanna> I once had a channel that nobody ever came to where I added people I thought were interesting to access list as a way of record keeping I guess
[02:40:15] <jan6> heh, interesting
[02:42:18] <Joanna> I don’t think I’d op someone unless I know them really really well :)
[02:42:58] <s1gyn> On pissnet we let almost anyone be a network oper
[02:43:53] <jan6> lol yeah
[02:43:59] <jan6> I op everyone I find cool
[02:44:22] <jan6> like what's the worst they can do anyway, in a channel they're basically the only people there, anyway
[02:44:54] <jan6> ban someone? I can undo it, ban me? I can unban myself, change topic? can be changed back, etc
[02:44:56] <jan6> ;P
[02:59:07] <Joanna> s1gyn: do you mean after lee took over ?
[02:59:31] *** Joins: genera (~Genera@user/genera)
[02:59:47] <s1gyn> pissnet != freenode/joseon
[03:00:15] <Joanna> That was a mess his ops seemed incompetent at best
[03:00:34] <Joanna> I think he destroyed network on purpose tbh
[03:00:55] <s1gyn> I agree
[03:01:15] <Joanna> I wonder who put him up to it
[03:01:32] <s1gyn> pissnet is mostly a big sandbox messing around with ircd or irc bots.
[03:02:19] <Joanna> I know someone who refuses to leave there :(. I think it’s really hard to join now
[03:02:48] <Joanna> You have to do preregistration on their website
[03:03:40] <Joanna> I’m so glad Libera was made I didn’t really understand how he could just take over .
[03:04:31] <jan6> from what I've gathered, he actually did legally aquire freenode, however questionable it was
[03:05:37] <jan6> so that explains the how
[03:05:49] <s1gyn> Thanks to Christel or however you spell her name
[03:05:59] <jan6> the freenode admins refused his attempts, until he started going to lawyers or such, iirc
[03:09:17] <Joanna> He probably bribed christel
[03:09:46] <Joanna> Does Libera have sponsors like freenode did?
[03:11:53] *** Quits: grobi (~grobi@user/grobi) (Quit: ᗧ•··ᗣ·ｂａｂｙ·🍒·•ｉ＇ｍ·♝··•ｂｏｒｅｄ·🍍·•··♞··ᗤ ᗣᗣᗣᗣ▀▄)
[03:12:20] <Joanna> I’m still not sure what he acquired. The domain name ? The servers? I thought servers belonged to sponsors but he was able to erase the data. Why didn’t the staff copy the accounts to libera I wonder
[03:13:13] <Joanna> That would have been a lot less disruptive but maybe passwords would be compromised if lee had copy
[03:14:29] <Joanna> It would make the move a lot less painful to just copy entire database
[03:15:53] *** Joins: grobi (~grobi@user/grobi)
[03:19:16] <jessicara> libera is technically it's own thing even if it's pretty much remade freenode
[03:19:46] <jessicara> imagine also being accused of stealing data
[03:31:00] <jan6> they intentionally didn't want to copy, I think, Joanna
[03:31:10] <jan6> and yeah, he got the domain name
[03:31:49] <jan6> the servers were run by volounteers, so he'd have no claim over them
[03:33:17] <jan6> like lee's whole reason to being brought on board in the first place was acting as an representional entity to organize and promote the chat 'n stuff
[03:38:21] *** Quits: shibboleth (~shibbolet@user/shibboleth) (Quit: shibboleth)
[03:44:04] <Joanna> But who owns the data really?
[03:44:31] <Joanna> If data is on servers run by volunteers
[03:52:04] <jan6> irc is never truly private, and never has been ;P
[03:52:14] <Joanna> Nope
[03:53:00] <jan6> network services are generally on their own node, though
[03:53:17] *** Quits: grobi (~grobi@user/grobi) (Quit: ᗧ•··ᗣ·ｂａｂｙ·🍒·•ｉ＇ｍ·♝··•ｂｏｒｅｄ·🍍·•··♞··ᗤ ᗣᗣᗣᗣ▀▄)
[03:53:40] <jan6> so the individual server's people would only see the chatter itself going through their specific server
[03:53:45] <Joanna> Irc is a place to chat with strangers primarily
[03:53:52] <jan6> not necessarily strangers
[03:53:56] <jan6> but yeah
[03:54:41] <jan6> IRC is the best place for foss support, imho
[03:54:48] <Joanna> Nothing else I know of matches irc as a place to find a topic you like and talk
[03:54:59] <jan6> because the barrier for entry is "can you at least get a direct socket connection, like, say, telnet"
[03:55:16] <jan6> if you want, you can IRC from friggen DOS
[03:55:25] <jan6> which makes it really awesome
[03:55:51] <jan6> of course, you'd probably want ssl, but I think there's people who've ported ssl, and...maybe even tls, to dos, lol
[03:55:55] <Joanna> Never tried that
[03:57:03] <jan6> there is the Arachne Web Browser for DOS which supports tls 1.3, apparently
[03:57:26] <jan6> so yeah, you can totally get even TLS-ed IRC working on DOS, if you're determined
[03:57:43] <jan6> nevermind all the webclients, and native clients for nigh' every platform
[03:57:53] <jan6> and ultra-low resource use
[03:59:04] <jan6> fun fact, "internet citizen's band" is a protocol that technically exists: http://www.icb.net/
[03:59:06] <SeaDough> ^ Internet CB Network (www.icb.net)
[03:59:23] <jan6> but there's very barely any support for it ANYWHERE
[03:59:52] <jan6> technically there is apps for it and stuff, though
[04:00:08] <jan6> ircii supports it too
[04:00:14] <jan6> and irssi too
[04:00:36] <jan6> it's not really relevant, but hey, the more you know, amirite?
