[13:29:53] <Me-me> Well.

[15:24:05] <ifohancroft> Hi! I am trying to find consecutive rows of data that are not identical. More precisely, they look like: int(<some-integer>) and right on the next row int(<some-integer>) and I am trying to find the rows/data where the integers in the two "functions" don't match, but I can't think of a regex for that. I am using Geany's regex engine, which is glib
[15:25:04] <ifohancroft> glib's regex. Currently, the way I am doing it is I have multiline regex turned on and I use "int\((\d+)\)\nint\(\1\)" to find matching rows and I keep hitting next to see if it would skip a row, but the file has almost 400K lines. 
[15:25:14] <ifohancroft> Basically, my question is what can I use to find unmatching ones
[15:25:59] <digitok> (int\(\d+\))(?!\n\1)
[15:27:10] <digitok> note that would match the 2nd line of 2 repeated lines
[15:27:21] <digitok> would you want that
[15:27:33] <ifohancroft> Thank you!
[15:27:41] <ifohancroft> Can you define what you mean by 2nd line of 2 repeated lines?
[15:27:48] <ifohancroft> like if the two lines are the same?
[15:27:53] <digitok> well, it checks the following line
[15:27:55] <digitok> correct
[15:28:05] <ifohancroft> actually let me check to see how it works and I'll answer you then
[15:28:37] <digitok> simplified example, "1\n\1\n2" would match 1 and 2
[15:28:45] <digitok> it won't match the first 1 because the following line is the same
[15:29:01] <digitok> "1\n1\n2" *
[15:29:27] <ifohancroft> No. I don't want that. The behavior is pretty much the same as what I was doing, but it selects the second line. I want to only mark lines where the second line is not the same (well, technically where the integer inside of int() is not the same)

[16:36:27] <purplex> StayHungry: comrade purplex thinks you can turn all your .*? to .*
[16:37:15] <StayHungry> indeed. in the past i met a few engines that become too greedy without ?
[16:37:52] <StayHungry> also i wonder what's the best alternative for \R (as not all of engines support that) -> [\r?\n\\+ ?
[16:38:09] <StayHungry> oh, sorry [\r?\n]+
[16:43:55] <purplex> \R includes a lot of line breaks, in a simple case \r?\n would work if you want both \r\n or \n
[16:46:34] <digitok> you need to capture each line i assume?
[16:46:47] <StayHungry> purplex: do you recommend to put \r?\n into [  ]+ ?
[16:47:18] <digitok> nope
[16:47:39] <digitok> you can, but you'd remove 07?
[16:47:46] <digitok> that's literal inside []
[16:47:51] <purplex> well a file will either have \r\n or \n not both so nope
[16:47:54] <StayHungry> digitok: that regex is intended to work as follows: grab four groups and then append each group to variable ($languages, $solutions1, $solutions2, $solution3)
[16:48:41] <digitok> right, then it looks good other than changing what purplex suggested
[16:49:01] <digitok> you probably don't need the last \R

[16:59:02] <NiLon> both [\r\n] and \r?\n are so basic that they should work, so likely issue is somewhere else
[16:59:36] <digitok> what's the line of code look like
[16:59:37] <NiLon> tho we are talking about microsoft so maybe assume nothing
[16:59:43] <StayHungry> yes, sir. ([A-Z0-9]+) part works, the rest is not, so i should check how powershell interprets multi-lines

[17:46:23] <purplex> ok i see, but i don't expect a program or editor to mix them randomnly, it will either use \r\n or \n
[17:47:45] <NiLon> most likely it won't happen randomly, but there are many valid cases where mix happens for very legit reasons
[17:48:03] <NiLon> or you could have repo where two editors are used with different configs and you have different linefeeds
[17:48:14] <NiLon> could be just two different people or even you using different ones
[17:48:30] <NiLon> or program could use mix them because programmer told it to do so for whatever reason
[17:49:19] <NiLon> point being, always, I mean ALWAYS expect both variants to be present
[17:50:46] <NiLon> it even can happen by accident because many protocols require \r\n, some don't so if you store data from different places you can have very easily mix of them

I have an example of what I'm attempting here, not sure if this is within the rules.. apologies if not. https://sebsauvage.net/paste/?cf80ce78c09d646b#J1C2V6Qcy9BDnF3Tytqrih+bZ+I2CppTcxFUhEdGfd8=

[20:04:07] <digitok> so what is the actual data?
[20:05:16] <digitok> you seem to be including spaces your attempt to match the 2 unknown chars, but there are no spaces anywhere else in the regex
[20:06:24] <digitok> also, you're attempting to match literal 2-char hex codes, but the other \x sequences will match an actual (single) char
[20:06:50] <JohnDoe2> \xAB matches the character «  --- this may not be what you're looking for starzen4. If you can dump your data in the same format that regex will see in your code, that would help lots. Use regex101.com to do the pasting stuff and then hit save in the left sidebar.

[20:16:06] <starzen4> I'm attempting to simplify a patcher I'm using to replace bytes in an ARM64 *.so file. The bytes used in the example were fictitious and just used as an example... but hex will need to be used as trying to go by ASCII is unreliable. the 's' in my example is what I was unsure if even needed and it was just based on the bytes.com example link I
[20:16:07] <starzen4> included in my paste. tl;dr.. I have an 8-byte hex pattern and need to replace bytes 2,3 and 4.. while bytes 5 and 6 will always vary. So I wanted to use regex as a 'wildcard' for bytes 5 and 6.  
[20:16:32] <starzen4> Just unsure of the 2-byte wildcard bit

[20:20:49] <JohnDoe2> starzen4 sorry that doesn't give much more information than you gave us initially. To answer your question, yes, s/a/b/ is a replacement regex syntax where a is replaced by b
[20:21:57] <JohnDoe2> otherwise the rest of the things you're talking about go back to my initial question: can you dump the specific part of the .so file to see what it looks like exactly? Regex itself doesn't care what you feed it, so long as your pattern matches it will do its thing

[20:38:51] <starzen4> JohnDoe2. thanks. yes, I am able to open up the *.so file to see what needs to patch. my "issue" is that I'm trying to automate a patcher to substitute a hex pattern without having to open the file and see what the updated "bytes 5 and 6 of the 8-byte pattern" are each time. So was trying to figure out how to work "[0-9a-fA-F]" into the command to
[20:38:52] <starzen4> cover the unknowns. 
[20:39:16] <starzen4> I think digitok may have given me something like what I needed tho and will poke around with that. Thank you for that response
[20:39:54] <re101-human-20> https://regex101.com/r/3DzQZa/1 I wouldn't like it to match the field after though sorry
[20:42:15] <JohnDoe2> starzen4 right, so can't quite help you since I don't know if you're feeding hex chars to regex or ascii representations of it. That part you'll have to figure out. But in both cases you can use a character class: [\xAB\x0F] will match either AB or 0F characters (not literally), which may give you the variability you need at the specific positions
[20:43:06] <JohnDoe2> starzen4 likewise, if it's ascii you can use something like 0x(?:AB|0F) or what have you to match a variable position
[20:43:48] <JohnDoe2> re101-human-20 did you mean "I would like it to match the field after" ? because right now it stops at either ) or a newline character
[20:45:19] <re101-human-20> I would not like it to match the field after, I would like it to match up to and including .exe or .pdf for the cs3/filepath field
[20:46:01] <JohnDoe2> re101-human-20 can you point to me where the current regex fails to do that?
[20:46:49] <re101-human-20> In the link i've sent back it matches 'somethingelse=1213233213' whereas I do not want it match this
[20:47:19] <JohnDoe2> re101-human-20 that's probably the wrong link?

[20:47:40] <JohnDoe2> re101-human-20 https://regex101.com/r/3DzQZa/1 that does not match otherinformation

[20:48:27] <JohnDoe2> re101-human-20 can your filenames contain spaces?
[20:48:38] <re101-human-20> No worries, thank you for the help. Yes they can contain spaces

[22:45:11] <StayHungry> it seems those blue lines on regex101 indicate the greediness 
[22:46:20] <purplex> the regex seems fine, so its something about how you are using it in your programming language
[22:47:10] <StayHungry> if i command .trim(), then ... are gone
[22:47:15] <purplex> are you using the match or, group 1?
[22:47:35] <purplex> group 2, group 3..
[22:48:05] <StayHungry> groups, yes
[22:49:20] <purplex> the groups aren't capturing line feed characters \r\n or \n at all
[22:50:30] <StayHungry> interestingly, if i replace .* with .*? so ([A-Z0-9]+)\r?\n(\*.*?)\r?\n(\*.*?)\r?\n(\*.*?) then
[22:51:21] <StayHungry> 2 of 3 lines with code are returned without ...
[22:51:37] <StayHungry> but the last one simply vanishes :D
[22:51:49] <StayHungry> oh, peculiar PowerShell
[22:52:38] <purplex> check if you have flag "dot matches line breaks" turned on
