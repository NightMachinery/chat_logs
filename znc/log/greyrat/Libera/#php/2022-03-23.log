[00:33:38] <entropy_> ok so... when i try to open this file: https://mypastebin.com/raw.php?id=PBXVrK - chrome downloads the file instead of opening it in a new tab.. any ideas?
[00:34:24] <Northwoods> Does session get reset when redirecting from read.example.com to example.com/mod/ ?
[00:34:35] <Northwoods> i am loosing session
[00:35:26] <TinoDidriksen> Northwoods, if you don't tell it which domain to set the cookie for, it gets set for the exact subdomain and thus won't work for the truncated domain.
[00:36:19] <Northwoods> TinoDidriksen, i see , so how can i tell it to set it for particular domain ?
[00:36:21] <TinoDidriksen> You can configure it to set it for the whole primary domain. But remember you can't set cookies for other domains.
[00:36:39] <Northwoods> yes ,  i need it for whole primary domain
[00:36:46] <TinoDidriksen> https://www.php.net/session_set_cookie_params or the equivalent ini directives.

[01:28:01] <da_wunder> ^nope
[01:29:05] <da_wunder> if that is your site - just look your logs to see what is happening

[01:31:56] <da_wunder> also some focus styling on those input would help a lot
[01:33:23] <da_wunder> and the most failing part is that if you submit invalid data you're returning 200 http status...
[01:34:04] <da_wunder> imho you should do simple checks in your frontside code that submit is not even allowed if form isn't valid
[01:34:46] <da_wunder> and then if your backend gets invalid request do not return 200 response return 4xx response

[01:47:04] <da_wunder> and really using specific cookies to show some errors is not the proper way to do that
[01:52:58] <da_wunder> specially when you're showing that error in dialog
[01:53:29] <__adrian> don't disagree, but regarding the 500: yes, go look at your logs.
[01:54:34] <da_wunder> imho - if you really want to show that error in dialog - then make that submit via ajax and show error dialog if the response status isn't 2xx and otherwise just redirect user to somewhere
[01:55:28] <da_wunder> with that you won't really see page reloading on that "save" process + you could easily show some loading indicator

[02:47:15] <Albright> That's… an interesting fix.
[02:47:22] <entropy_> heh yeah
[02:48:22] <Albright> Just for fun, did you try doing "Content-Type" instead of "Content-type"? I *think* browsers should treat both the same but the former is more "correct."
[02:49:24] <entropy_> yes same problem
[02:50:19] <Albright> Weird. I'm sure there's a way to do this.
[03:04:13] <__adrian> browsers don't (and shouldn't be expected to) allow you (the website) to decide how content is displayed/downloaded
[03:05:42] <__adrian> content-type is for telling what the content _is_, not what to do with it
[03:08:55] <Albright> True as that may be, I'm fairly confident all major browsers are capable of displaying a text file.
[03:09:06] <Albright> And I think that's what they should do if there's no Content-Disposition: attachment;
[03:09:42] <Albright> Pastebin allows showing "raw" pastes, right? Might be worth seeing what they're doing.
[03:13:29] <Blondie101010> Albright:  which implies it's not plain text

[16:09:26] <livingbeef> my api is returning a json, and I'd like to cache sub-object (serialized as json in DB). Issue is, they are not the top level object I'm returning, so it seems like I'd have to decode the cached data, add them to the top-level response object, and then encode them again. Is there some way around this? Or are the performance implications of this negligable?
[16:11:23] <Blondie101010> livingbeef:  do you mean to add elements to a JSON string in a relational DB?
[16:14:50] *** Quits: otisolsen70 (~otisolsen@xd4ed80b5.cust.hiper.dk) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[16:15:16] <__adrian> livingbeef: tl;dr: yes
[16:15:54] <__adrian> as for performance implications: write code that correctly does the thing you want first. later, IF there are performance problems, you can think about solving those.
[16:16:17] <livingbeef> I mean, I'll be sending things like [{"foo":1, ..., "bar": <obj>}, {"foo":...}] over API, where <obj> would be cached in DB (as a string). In the API, I'll then send slimething like json_encode([["foo"=>1, ..., "bar"=> <obj>], ...]), but the issue is, that <obj> is a string, not an object/array, and would be json-encoded twice
[16:18:15] <Blondie101010> there's no *good* reason to store JSON in a DB exactly for the points you mention...  a DB is to store the actual data, and if you want to output some of it as JSON, you do it when needed
[16:18:15] <__adrian> that doesn't seem like enough of a problem to be stuck solving  ;)  but blondie's concern is more about "serialized as json in DB," which is very often a bad design decision
[16:20:03] <Blondie101010> optimizing a bad design is also rarely a good idea
[16:20:12] <__adrian> mm
[16:20:24] <__adrian> if it really is just a cache (i.e., not data you need to access/search/manipulate)... but then, why does it need to go in the DB?
[16:20:42] <Blondie101010> or get new elements
[16:20:44] <livingbeef> that's part of it; then there's the issue that I'll ALSO be sending some of that data over firebase push notifications, and some of it is _just_ little bit over the 4k limit - gzip + base64 would solve this, but then it'll be all kinda messy
[16:22:07] <Blondie101010> livingbeef:  can't the notification just inform the client of a link/resource, and then the client pulls it?
[16:22:20] <livingbeef> I'm thinking that some format that I'd cache and send over as just single string would be best
[16:23:07] <livingbeef> they can, but there's a lot of clients that want that data in some cases, sending the data directly can save a lot of server resources
[16:24:20] <__adrian> "a lot"?  wouldn't it only save sending the link?
[16:24:51] <__adrian> if even one client decided they didn't want the data, would make up for that
[16:25:19] <__adrian> but that's kinda besides the question

[16:26:10] <Blondie101010> livingbeef:  is the data pushed the same for all connected clients at that moment?
[16:26:24] <livingbeef> I mean when they are fetching the data, not when I'm sending it. It's single push notification vs 100s of clients fetching the same data over api
[16:26:40] *** Joins: tccki (~tccki@box.webslate.co.nz)

[16:32:10] <livingbeef> a complication here probably is that the endpoint MIGHT return different data for different clients on some requests, it just doesn't for most traffic
[16:32:16] <Blondie101010> livingbeef:  if you have a certain record to send to many at the same time, sure preparing it once to send to all makes sense, but that doesn't imply having to operate on JSON directly, just make it once for the batch while handling the data in a regular variable format
[16:32:42] <Blondie101010> hmmm, do you control that end point?
[16:33:14] <livingbeef> I do. It's a "give me all the new changes" endpoint.
[16:34:30] <Blondie101010> do you already do push notifications in PHP?
[16:35:21] <livingbeef> currently, I'm thinking I'll just do it as json => gz => DB => api(b64 as part of response) => client

[16:41:43] <livingbeef> laregely, this is about uniformity and predictability. If I can store, send and receive this <obj> and be sure that it's always gzipped json, regardless of whether it's in db, was fetched from API, or came from push notif, it'll probably save me a lot of headache
[16:42:34] <livingbeef> as I see it, it's this, or just not sending the data over push notifs at all
[16:43:39] <livingbeef> which I may end up doing, after all

[20:18:20] <teresko> how did you come to that conclusion?
[20:19:02] <tester12> the response of page2 should be in the form of JSON

[20:23:33] <tester12> teresko
[20:24:00] <teresko> if you are a javascript developer, you should instead write the backend in the programming language you ACTUALLY know - javascript
[20:24:53] <tester12> I use curl in php and all processing run in server side not client
[20:25:05] <tester12> teresko
[20:25:13] <Naktibalda> curl code is in page1, it has no effect on response of page2
[20:25:17] <Naktibalda> right?
[20:27:32] <Naktibalda> unless page2 does content negotiation and formats response according to Accept header,  then you may have to add Accept: application/json header to request.
[20:27:39] <tester12> Naktibalda  first of all page1 send data to page2 by CURL and page2 check data and should send response in form of JSON to page1

[21:19:32] <Robdgreat> Sir, this is a Wendy's
[21:20:03] <AllenJB> Random guess: When the maintainer has time. Previous IANA release was 22nd Oct, and the pecl package updated 3rd Nov, so that was approx 1.5 weeks

[23:36:52] <funhouse> How to make it not cache
[23:36:59] <__adrian> it's not "caching"
[23:37:23] <__adrian> read the docs - appending new lines to the array is completely intentional and by design
[23:37:42] <__adrian> docs also answers your question, btw
[23:38:21] <__adrian> don't pass the same array to it. pass a new array.
