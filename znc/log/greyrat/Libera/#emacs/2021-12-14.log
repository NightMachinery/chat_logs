[15:31:58] <FrostKiwi> Hey there :]  Happy user of LSP-mode in Emacs + clangd on FreeBSD here. I ran into a problem with Emacs on Windows 10 with the MSYS2 + MinGW64 environment. LSP-mode fails with the error "Disabling backend flymake-cc because (file-error Writing to process Invalid argument gcc-flymake)", "file-error Writing to process Bad file descriptor gcc-flymake". Full details and logs: https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode/issues/3255 . As a result
[15:31:59] <FrostKiwi> it's as if compile_commands.json is ignored and all functions are underlined as unknown or without reference. Has anyone seen something like this?

[16:01:07] <FrostKiwi> pkal: "Emacs/Flymake is trying to invoke a GCC to check the syntax" isn't that the job of clangd?

[21:51:33] <aniketgm> I'm on windows. I usually just download and install the fonts. And emacs has some mechanism to pick them up.
[21:52:15] <aniketgm> however, you could try something like this (mapc 'load (file-expand-wildcards "/location/to/a/unicode-fonts.el"))

[21:59:08] <roadie> I don't have it
[21:59:10] <xaltsc> Yes I know, that's not quite the point, the difficulty is in the order it choses the fonts in order to determine which font to use to display a character. My font Julia Mono is listed in describe-fontset, so emacs knows about it. It also appears above misc-fixed-*, the default X11 font, so Emacs should know that it should use this font. However it does not. Except when I increase text-scale

[23:09:02] <thblt> lxsameer: the hard part will probably be implementing cleanly some sort of subscription system for buffers, and ideally garbage-collecting the watchers at some point.
[23:09:59] <lxsameer> indeed
[23:10:00] <thblt> Though "subscription" may just be a global variable with the branch name for each worktree, and the mode-line reading this.
[23:10:55] <thblt> eg something like (intern (format "lxsameer--branch-for-%s" (git-worktree-root (buffer-file-name)))), then put the value of this in the modeline.
[23:11:30] <thblt> So buffers don't need to care, *but* garbage collection still needed.  Maybe a timer could be enough for this one.
