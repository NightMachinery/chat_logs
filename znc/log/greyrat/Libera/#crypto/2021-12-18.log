[00:02:46] <Alipha> MacGyver: okay, yeah, there are some diminishing returns, but i don't think it ends up being significant, if i'm thinking about this right. for 4 64-bit keys, if you wanted to crack it in 2^32 space, i think it would require 2^(256-32) + 2^64 operations, not 2^(256-32), as i stated.
[00:03:52] <Swemole> Well, in either case,Â  those layers makes the cracking much harder. :)
[00:04:02] <ioxzev1z> I don't think 2^64 space is so unrealistic
[00:05:02] <Alipha> for the meet in the middle, you'd split it into 1 key and 3 keys. write down 2^32 keys for the 1 key. then try 2^192 key combinations to try to match up against those 2^32 keys you wrote down. if there's no match, then write down the next 2^32 keys. 
[00:05:09] <Swemole> I think they already brute forced 2^64, right?
[00:05:29] <Alipha> so then for the 1 key side, you're trying 2^64 keys. for the 3 key side, you're trying 2^192 keys 2^32 times
[00:06:48] <Alipha> 2^64 + 2^(192+32), which is the same as 2^(256-32) + 2^64
[00:07:41] <ioxzev1z> 2^64 space is just ~4.3 billion ~4.3G hard drives, no?
[00:07:52] <ioxzev1z> So with current sizes that drops to millions

[03:11:58] <Wulf> MrFantastik: too complicated, too few users, key servers are not resistant to abuse, privacy issues. And probably a lot more you could easily find by yourself.

[03:14:26] <MrFantastik> its pretty standard practice to use it in darknet markets though which i feel like is a decently high selection
[03:17:08] <iz> doesn't mean it's smart to use in that scenario though.. probably don't want proof of your transactions laying around
[03:17:11] <MrFantastik> i don't mean to start a flame war, I genuinely don't understand the sentiment, but I see it in a lot of crypto and security posts 
[03:18:21] <MrFantastik> if you destroy your keys aren't you safe?
[03:18:35] <MrFantastik> or is that against the point of something like pgp
[03:18:43] <iz> depends on if you used them for other things that link you or not
[03:18:59] <iz> yeah, that's one thing
[03:19:14] <MacGyver> So to reiterate, it's too complicated, doesn't have enough users, key servers are not resistant to abuse, it has privacy issues; the user interface is complete bonkers, too much trust is put in the users knowing WTF they're doing, the cryptographic constructions are outdated, the encryption keys are long-term... what else...

[03:22:39] <MacGyver> And I would say that looking at what is "commonly used" is something entirely different from what is secure.
[03:22:50] <MacGyver> You asked what the problem is with PGP and/or GPG.
[03:22:52] <MacGyver> We told you.
[03:23:09] <MacGyver> The fact that it's commonly used in that setting does not *negate* those problems.
[03:23:14] <iz> a protocol like signal or OTR would be much better in that scenario, re: long-term keys
[03:23:19] <MrFantastik> yea that's true

[03:29:33] <iz> yeah, pretty much
[03:29:35] <MacGyver> But "plenty of alternatives" are a bit...
[03:29:40] <MacGyver> Disappointing.
[03:29:43] <MrFantastik> :/
[03:29:51] <MacGyver> Let me explain.
[03:29:59] <MacGyver> PGP is a swiss army knife, right.
[03:30:14] <MacGyver> It has a shitload of tools, they all approximate what we want, but it does nothing well.
[03:30:18] <iz> so a lot of the alternatives require an active connection.. PGP is nice in that it can do most of it's magic while offline
[03:30:38] <MacGyver> Over the past two decades of security and crypto research has taught us we don't want such a thing.
[03:30:43] <iz> but that's also where a lot of it's weaknesses come from
[03:30:53] <MacGyver> What you want is *specific* tools tailored to *specific* use cases.
[03:30:58] <iz> yeah
[03:31:10] <MacGyver> And you may find that for the specific use case you want a tool for, nobody has bothered to create one yet.
[03:31:27] <MacGyver> In particular: there will probably never be a replacement for PGP-encrypted e-mail *that still uses e-mail*.
[03:31:45] <MacGyver> For one, because PGP is *annoyingly* resilient.
[03:32:15] <MacGyver> For another, because it's probably not possible to truly secure e-mail because it'll always have the header problem.

[12:18:43] <Thomas25> wasamasa maybe i haven't worded it correctly. it is completely plausible that governments intervened with TC development and that VC has backdoors in it. If anything that history thought us.
[12:19:52] <wasamasa> and why would that not be an option for TC?
[12:20:09] <wasamasa> what does the license/governance model of a software have to do with backdoors?
[12:21:05] <Thomas25> it would have been an option for TC but it was very weirdly and abdruptly stopped, which could mean, government interfered with it because it was basically unbreakable
[12:21:07] <wasamasa> if you look at actual cases, you'd find that in the cases where there's no source available, it's easier to get away with code you wouldn't want to have there, lol
[12:21:39] <wasamasa> that is a conspiracy theory alright
[12:22:10] <wasamasa> but if I look at other people's one man show projects and how many of them stop for no government-related reason, it's a rather weak theory
[12:22:49] <Thomas25> i disagree. the way TC stopped and instead recommended a known weak solution doing so.
[12:23:48] <Thomas25> so you agree that governments could introduce backdoors but do not agree with the TC exit controversy being too shady
[12:24:12] <wasamasa> I don't agree with any of that
[12:24:13] <yawkat> if youre concerned just use luks
[12:24:30] <Peng> Doesn't TC have known moderately serious vulnerabilities
[12:24:31] <wasamasa> the only thing I agree with is that the incompetence of governments is the only thing that can save us :P
[12:24:37] <Thomas25> if you think governments inserting backdoors is a conspiracy theroy, you must be living in a bubble :)
[12:25:04] <Thomas25> Peng i haven't checked it myself but vulnerabilities were classified as minor and does not affect most use cases
[12:25:19] <Thomas25> (from what i've read in articles, didn't check the vulnerabilities myself)
[12:26:50] <wasamasa> the competence of governments aside, why would VC be more susceptible to that than TC?
[12:27:17] <wasamasa> if there was external pressure exerted on the project, gag orders to not make them say anything exist
[12:28:11] <riv> yes i recommend linux luks for FDE
[12:28:22] <riv> not some random outdated thing that runs on windows=
[12:28:26] <riv> hth
[12:33:26] <wasamasa> if anything, the incident would only serve as reaffirmation to not use janky windows-first software
[12:38:43] <Thomas25> yeah that's fine but in this particular case i need interoperatbility
[12:39:01] <Thomas25> in fact i'm storying a tiny 1mb enc disk in google drive
[12:39:13] <Thomas25> for stuff like metamask secrets etc
[12:40:27] <Thomas25> i'm not saying government is after my metamask, of course. you know i'm just thinking about theorical safety
[12:41:02] <riv> glad people recognize that google is the true government
[12:41:54] <Thomas25> zero trust safety :)
[12:42:54] <Thomas25> have you seen the utf8 vulnerability, dear god.
[12:43:51] <riv> which one :)
[12:44:59] <Thomas25> the invisible code one
[12:45:23] <Thomas25> anyway, back to the original question, what would be the best way to store a small size encrypted disk on untrusted cloud
[12:46:33] <riv> I am not totally sure, to encrypt and decrypt a single file with a password or something
[12:47:17] <riv> i guess there's password protected 7zips
[12:47:42] <Thomas25> less convenient to open, save, sync
[12:48:21] <Thomas25> tc vulnerabilities were about full disk encryption iirc
[12:48:34] <Thomas25> so 7.1a actually looks like the best bet to me atm
[12:49:08] <riv> why did you ask if youre just going to reject anything is ay
[12:49:55] <Thomas25> i think it's healthy to discuss
[12:50:07] <Thomas25> i think your proposal is inconvenient
