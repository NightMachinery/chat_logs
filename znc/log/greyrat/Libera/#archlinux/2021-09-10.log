[00:11:49] <feinedsquirrel> does netctl have a mechanism to use dhcp with a fallback static ip? I know dhcpcd does, but I haven't been able to find if netctl can access that. Also, the netctl.profile man page says I can use IPCustom=() for argument lines to ip, but I tried IPCustom=('link set dev eth0 address <mac_address>') netctl failed to start the profile. Any ideas on either of these?

[13:14:35] <Gagis> seems plausible obs would see only non-native windows. ill copy paste a bit of what they said in backlog, excuse me
[13:14:56] <Gagis> 09:49 <ariaverge> According to this post (that admittedly I just found via Google) it supports pipewire and wayland natively in v27 - https://www.linuxuprising.com/2021/06/obs-studio-27-released-with-wayland-and.html
[13:14:58] <demonicmaniac> there's some weird shit with pipewire and portals in obs 27 to also capture xwayland stuff
[13:14:58] <Gagis> 09:49 <ariaverge> But if I had to guess, it's locked under a compile flag in the PKGBUILD like a lot of other recent features
[13:15:00] <Gagis> 09:50 <ariaverge> Installing obs-studio-git from the AUR and editing the PKGBUILD is how I get proper browser source support enabled
[13:15:02] <Gagis> 09:59 <grawity> there's still the issue with Qt5 avoiding Wayland in GNOME

[13:42:56] <DeeJayh_> fltrz: my main concern is that if they aren't even showing under EFI after restoring defaults, then you're looking at a failed USB controller for the bank of ports. Another thing to consider is "which" port. I had a laptop or two that it would detect USB drives connected to one port, but not another, even though both worked in the host OS
[13:43:39] <DeeJayh_> Which seems totally impossible since they were likely traced to the same controller, but I swear it.
[13:45:08] <tatsumaru> demonicmaniac, the browser works fine and it's irrelevant in this case, it's a native wayland app that OBS can't see (LibreOffice) while in Gnome Wayland mode.
[13:45:23] <tatsumaru> therefore I can't capture LibreOffice's window

[13:52:50] <demonicmaniac> tatsumaru: i would assume xlsclients for you also lists obs-studio then meaning obs does not run in wayland mode
[13:52:52] <Gagis> maybe theres a flag in bios that you need to switch to enable booting from removable drives
[13:53:00] <demonicmaniac> so the issue would be somehow with gnome being dumb
[13:53:17] <fltrz> woot the fourth port worked

[14:32:50] <hellfir> running rofi from terminal and using that to launch steam breaks it too...
[14:33:04] <Edu4rdSHL> What the terminal logs says?
[14:33:52] <hellfir> using default/fallback debugger launch, then it's stuck on the line showing the steam install location

[14:34:39] <raster> i have no idea what rofi is - other than maybe a launcher...
[14:34:39] <hellfir> but that's exactly what it said previously too
[14:34:47] <hellfir> on successful launches
[14:34:47] <raster> but is it perhaops literally running "steam %U"
[14:34:49] <hellfir> exactly raster
[14:34:53] <raster> and the %U arg is messing it up?
[14:35:17] <hellfir> nope

[14:35:39] <Edu4rdSHL> Well, blame rofi
[14:35:41] <raster> ie rofi does not know that %U us an "optional argument to replace with a url to open that url with that tool" ?
[14:35:42] <Edu4rdSHL> :p
[14:35:55] <hellfir> yeah I'm trying to figure out what the fuck rofi is doign now lol
[14:36:26] <hellfir> that'd be odd if true raster, because it's been fine with steam up until this morning
[14:37:01] <raster> hmm, steam seems to ignore %U and launches for me

[14:39:25] <raster> my wm launches things for me and it's doing fine so ... :/
[14:39:33] <hellfir> it... might be a sway config issue....?
[14:39:47] <hellfir> i just ran rofi in a different mode from CLI and then launched steam and it was fine
[14:40:03] <fltrz> DeeJayh_, I don't have any of the drives, and easyupload.io responds with a server error 0 after selecting file, expiration date

I plan to install this on a headless server and need a way to configure it so I don't have to pull the server off the rack.

[17:52:05] <ayekat> the only situation where I could think of the snap approach being worth considering is if you're somehow stuck with an ancient release of some distro that doesn't ship an up-to-date version of certbot - and even there, I'd consider it a bandaid at best (and probably prefer using something else, like dehydrated)

[19:41:41] <h4rd3n3D_> barbarossa93:  not sure if you believe you can out-think the original Intel CPU electrical engineers by 'under-volting'.  Are you operating under the assumption that one of their primary objectives was NOT to deliver a CPU which maximized performance while minimizing power consumption?  Do you think they only ran 20-100 tests prior to producing several hundred million CPUs?

[19:46:28] <Hello71> h4rd3n3D_: for one, intel doesn't individually test the allowable voltage of each chip. they set a single acceptable level, test that it works on 99.999% of cpus, and then ship it. you may have a better chip that can handle lower voltages. second, aiui the voltage is actually set by the motherboard vendors which are notoriously crap

[19:54:25] <CaptainDrewBoy> I have an installed system (running parabola, basically arch with different default repos and openrc). I need to install a package to fix my wifi, but obviously can't do so normally on account of the broken wifi. It occured to me I could do so with my installation usb. So would I be better off using pacstrap to install the package, or chrooting in and using pacman? I want this package to be usable on my

[22:00:51] <lucyy> Hi all - in the past days, I've made the (frustrating to troubleshoot) discovery that the usage of ccache with suckless software (at least, dwm and st) results in the unwanted caching of config.h, even when it has changed on disk. Is there anything that should be done to document this? e.g. a section on ArchWiki, a "CCACHE_DISABLE=1" in the PKGBUILDs.
[22:00:55] *** Joins: fstd (~fstd@xdsl-87-79-158-186.nc.de)
[22:01:41] <Tom^> lucyy: that sounds odd, if config.h changes ccache shouldnt use the cached one hm
[22:02:27] <lucyy> Yes, it's annoying - it only appears to be the case with gcc too, I didn't have the issue with clang.

[23:09:03] <demonicmaniac> bobsy_: they are aur deps
[23:09:10] <DeeJayh> It was a lowercase a instead of a capital A. solved. *sigh*
[23:09:26] <bobsy_> demonicmaniac: oic, thanks.  do aur deps have to be installed manually?
[23:09:57] *** Joins: spare (~v3epgr4gd@user/spareproject)
[23:10:53] <bobsy_> like do i have to use yay -S on those deps, or checkout the git and run makepkg for each dep that resides in the aur tree?

[23:11:26] <demonicmaniac> if you already use yay then yay openstack should resolve aur deps and build in order
[23:11:47] <demonicmaniac> otherwise yes. or use something like aurutils

[23:12:37] <bobsy_> i still get unresolved deps error

[23:13:02] <DeeJayh> Is `yay` "the move"? I haven't played with AUR packages yet, but I understand that it can do anything pacman can do, plus accesses AUR, so for most ordinary uses (-Ss -Syu -S) we can just use yay, right?

[23:19:01] <bobsy_> ok
[23:19:04] <demonicmaniac> i see the issue
[23:19:18] <demonicmaniac> in the dependency chain are some split pkgbuilds for pythyon2 and python3

[23:21:17] <bobsy_> demonicmaniac: are you suggesting those python modules should be built with one pkgbuild?
[23:21:20] <demonicmaniac> you'll just have to "fix" the pkgbuilds for python-confluent-kafka and python-jsonpath-rw-ext to not be a split pkgbuild

[23:21:31] <Synthead> is there a way I can change a password in pass from a script?
[23:21:31] <demonicmaniac> they should have seperate pkgbuilds for python2 and python3 yes
[23:21:52] <MrElendig> there should be no PKGBUILD for python2  /devil
[23:21:58] <demonicmaniac> split pkgbuilds are fine for repo packages but were never a good idea for the aur and aren' even supported
[23:22:56] <demonicmaniac> remove the python 2 parts from those 2 pkgbuilds i suppose and install them manually but --asdeps and then try again with whatever yay pikaur aurutils bla
[23:23:08] <demonicmaniac> and post comments on those
[23:23:11] <bobsy_> the aur package i found for confluent_kafka uses an underscore in the name rather that a -
[23:23:24] <demonicmaniac> we should really do an automated run of the aur and yell at all the split pkgbuilds
[23:23:30] <bobsy_> should i just be able to replace the - with a _ in the nova pkgbuild?
[23:23:37] <morganamilo> there's nothing wrong with split packages 
[23:24:10] <demonicmaniac> in aur it is because makepkg can not build only part that functionality was removed and was never intended to be abused

[23:24:24] <demonicmaniac> and for all the python2/3 split shit it's pure horror

[23:31:42] <bobsy_> which it does not.
[23:31:45] <bobsy_> the dep that is.
[23:32:14] <bobsy_> but a PKGBUILD includes that string

[23:38:21] <bobsy_> the query originally stemmed from trying to search for that package in the AUR webpage in the search field, it would be neat if it showed which package has it in it's PKGBUILD by mistake
