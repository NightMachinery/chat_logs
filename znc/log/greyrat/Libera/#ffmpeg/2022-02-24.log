I haven't been able to find it by searching the source code and was wondering whether there was an easy way to convert it from an int in a way that I can search the source code and find the origin of the error. In this particular

[19:26:58] <rxyevejh> I'm having a lot of problems streaming to RTMP (from C++ code using `libav` ). My stream always disconnects within a few seconds when I add an audio stream (video on its own is fine). I get error messages on `rtmp-nginx` like ` too big message: 1048576` and `RTMP in chunk stream too big: 65 >= 32,` Has anybody come across this before? Any tips about where to start debugging this?
[19:27:29] <rxyevejh> Interestingly it writes audio + video out to a `.flv` file fine
[19:28:06] <Blrp> Hello there! I want to add chapters to a m4b file. How do I set END for the last chapter in the metadata file? Seemingly I must know the exact file length. Is there a way to use ffmpeg to get the exact length?
