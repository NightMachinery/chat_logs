[07:32:26] <ChetManly> sussudio, yes to bios
[07:33:20] <ChetManly> I am surprised the expert install didnt ask me where to install grub to, thats why I am asking
[07:33:35] <sussudio> ChetManly: yes, it's a pain in the ass. i vaguely recall uefi files being case sensitive and if you pick the "wrong" one, it won't boot.
[07:33:37] <ChetManly> no installation path
[07:34:16] <sussudio> ChetManly: are you doing this on a real system or a vm
[07:34:33] <ChetManly> I thought maybe it put it on the wrong disk but that isnt it either

[07:37:17] <ChetManly> nothing
[07:37:42] <sussudio> does it say can't find boot device or what
[07:38:02] <ChetManly> no operating system found so I dont think it rescue-able
[07:38:13] <sussudio> just try rescatux
[07:38:18] <ChetManly> its the right boot device also

[13:21:07] <Khepra> because it's _new_ package, not just new version of existing package. that's how kernel pacakges work in debian, and that's why the metapackage is important: to pull in new packages

[13:23:48] <Khepra> that's how sane distros with only ONE package manager (and it's GUI bindings) work.

[15:51:05] <waylore> hey, since you're talking about firmware, on boot I get a 'bcm firmware missing' (for broadcom wifi). My wifi works perfectly fine though, so should I just ignore it?
[15:51:14] <udaba> Im really sorry , and i know that this isnt for testing...Thanks for your help though :))
[15:51:15] <jelly> ignore it
[15:51:22] <waylore> ok
[15:51:33] <udaba> anyone knows how i can reproduce which firmware im missing?
[15:52:03] <jelly> waylore, you could be missing functionalitly you're not using at the moment, like maybe you can't run the card in AP mode, or similar
[15:52:04] <udaba> the paste bin is from my laptop. how i can reproduce same firmware missing output on my desktop?
[15:52:28] <waylore> jelly: would google help me figure out the solution?
[15:52:37] <sussudio> waylore: broadcom firmware is also non-free
[15:52:42] <jelly> waylore, to figure out a solution you first need to have a problem
[15:52:57] <jelly> things work?  You don't have a problem
[15:52:59] <Khepra> udaba: update-initramfs -u     and see if it complains.    also,   dmesg | grep -i firmware     will tell you if the kernel wants firmware files that are missing
[15:53:05] <BitStonk> PerfDave: Presuming you mean power management in the Gnome GUI, will have to wait until I'm home for that :P
[15:53:07] <waylore> sussudio: yes, is that an issue?
[15:53:09] <udaba> Thanks brb
[15:53:15] <Haohmaru> jelly you could download more problems ;P~
[15:53:18] <waylore> jelly: yep, you are right
[15:53:22] <sussudio> waylore: it is if you don't have non-free in your sources.list
[15:53:31] <jelly> Haohmaru, you wouldn't download a problem!
[15:53:45] <Haohmaru> some do it all the time!
[15:53:45] <Khepra> a browser entered the chat
[15:54:00] <waylore> sussudio: I have installed the broadcom WiFi driver from the non-free repos and it works perfectly, no issues. I just get a weird missing firmware message on boot time
[15:54:23] <udaba> 1st command passed fine ,2nd command got me this : https://paste.debian.net/1235099/
[15:54:24] <waylore> but jelly says it's no big deal, and I agree. no issue then moving on
[15:55:05] <Khepra> udaba: you're apparently not missing firmware. missed fimrware is logged as that: file paths the kernel wants and can't find
[15:55:31] <sussudio> waylore: use apt-file to find what package it's in.

[15:58:41] <jelly> sussudio, probably some sort of hw acceleration, tcp offload, checksum offload...
[15:58:48] <Khepra> waylore: I am a she, so is she, yes.
[15:58:50] <udaba> if i do only dmesg im getting a lot like this : ACPI BIOS Error (bug): Could not resolve symbol [\_SB.PCI0.SAT0.PRT3._GTF.DSSP], AE_NOT_FOUND (20210930/psargs-330) -ACPI Error: Aborting method \_SB.PCI0.SAT0.PRT3._GTF due to previous error (AE_NOT_FOUND) (20210930/psparse-529)
[15:59:06] <sussudio> jelly: i'm not noticing a difference after installing the firmware package.
[15:59:36] <jelly> yeah, we would not notice it at work, except a couple weeks later eth0 would drop the connection

[16:23:51] <haroon> jelly, `nameserver 192.168.242.2` which is my pihole, I also tried it with `8.8.8.8` which didn't work either.
[16:24:17] <Khepra> haroon: so which "dns name" can you ping?
[16:25:08] <jelly> haroon, ok.  I think systemd-resolved is irrelevant unless you have nameserver 127.0.0.53 in /etc/resolv.conf
[16:25:42] <kjetilho> jelly: no, it is used by glibc if you have resolve in /etc/nsswitch.conf, too
[16:25:48] <jelly> haroon, can you pastebin or screenshot the output of "apt update" ?
[16:26:02] <jelly> kjetilho, wtf, they also have a separate nss module?

[20:09:25] <fling> where did you hide the actual build script/
[20:12:14] <Khepra> karlpinc: I think systemd doesn't care about readiness for Type=forking units. I'm not 100% sure on that, though. Meaning, it'll consider the unit started when the main master PID is obtained, regardless of what that process has to do to launch/fork workers
[20:12:36] <Khepra> karlpinc: really the only Type which matters is notify, and postgres DOES support it, but the debian's default unit doesn't utilize it
[20:12:44] <karlpinc> Khepra: (postgresql@.service does have ExecStart=-...  So maybe pg_ctlcluster _is_ failing (due to timeout) and returning anyway.  (The target system is _really_ slow.)
[20:12:54] <Khepra> forking shouldn't be used with systemd unless threre's really NO other option.
[20:13:38] <karlpinc> Khepra: It's because the service file uses pg_ctrlcluster, which I have to admit is handy.
[20:13:51] <Khepra> unfortunately, maintainers that do Type=forking, for daemons that DO support simple and notify, don't really understand how systemd works.
