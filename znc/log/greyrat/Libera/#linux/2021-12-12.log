[06:00:57] <Dagmar> 1. The default behaviour for almost every distribution is to _not_ generate coredumps, because they frequently contain sensitive information, and they also can waste a ton of disk space if no one's doing anything but letting them pile up
[06:01:11] <Dagmar> 2. You need to tell the kernel it's allowed to make core dumps, and tell it where to put them.
[06:01:27] <Mister_Magister> yeah i thought its not really user friendly

[10:32:37] <n4dir> after having tried all kind of methods without any success, that russian lady told me to give up on all but just add table-salt to the bath. It helped, and quickly. But if the skin is already cracked, it probably won't be much fun
[10:32:44] <domhnall> must be a company that sells electronics
[10:33:26] <n4dir> any salt should to, they sell it here for bathing, but table-salt is cheap. duh
[10:33:29] <Sauvin> Yeah, salt was bad. Jalapeno was worse.
[10:34:19] <Sauvin> Salt isn't necessarily salt. Table salt is sodium chloride, but I believe the stuff you scatter all over the sidewalks in icy weather is something like calcium chloride.
[10:34:24] <n4dir> Sauvin: that is what is with those trick you run in. They work for you, but might fail (horribly) for others

[10:57:12] <ZombieChicken> paulcarroty: Nice to hear
[10:57:16] <SudoBash> an alias?
[10:57:24] <bparker> sudomann: the first question is, are you not wanting the actual gcc package for some reason
[10:57:34] <paulcarroty> @bparker , bullshit, rpi4 is only 1.5ghz
[10:57:36] <euphoricallysane> Fsck, it hurts, every time. su or su -c :/
[10:57:36] <bparker> which is probably an even different version

[10:58:48] <bparker> so the question is which one do you really want
[10:58:52] <bparker> if you don't care, just install "gcc"

[13:20:50] <hmaurer> To give you some additional context, I recently faced a problem where I had a server listening on 127.0.0.1 on some ports, and I wanted to access it from my local network without modifying what IP the server was bound to. After some googling I figured out that I could use Socat, like so: `socat TCP-LISTEN:1234,bind=0.0.0.0 TCP:localhost:1234`.
[13:20:50] <hmaurer> However, I don't really understand what's going on here (other than that it's somehow listening on the local network and proxying to localhost). So I'd like to learn enough to understand this

[17:02:39] <jim> the reading of man pages that ayecee said is a good suggestion too; reading that kind of material is a really good skill to have, that you can get by practicing: read a man page every day

[17:18:30] <ayecee> probably same grub though
[17:18:46] <jim> for your info, debian 11 is bullseye
[17:18:49] <rustytaco>  mean i have a pi 4 that has a couple ham radios hooked up to it that i poke about with over the internet...they're pretty high end for an embedded machine (heck they have a full multitasking OS); but definitely much less power than a midrange smartphone or lower end PC
[17:18:54] <dka> do you think I can configure and install grub after performing an installation without it ?
[17:18:56] <rustytaco> ayecee: No grub on aarm
[17:19:04] <dka> I am sure it is possible, but do you think it can be done easily?

[19:50:59] <blackgatonegro> beuys is why I said to just put the phone is usb charging mode, you may lose data if you were copying or writing to the phone but it does work. Alternatively just shutdown the computer and hope you don't get any errors.

[20:21:22] <superkuh> I guess I should just look at the arch wiki.
[20:21:54] <alkisg> superkuh: yes, I have that with windows 10 and ubuntu
[20:22:07] <alkisg> You'll need both an EFI partition and a bios_grub partition

[20:22:41] <superkuh> Okay. Did you just know how to do this, or do you perhaps know of some guide or reference page I could look at online?
[20:22:41] <alkisg> So e.g. on ubuntu, I have both grub-pc and grub-efi installed
[20:23:14] <alkisg> Ah, note that windows will only boot under uefi, while linux will boot both under uefi and bios
[20:23:19] * superkuh nods.
[20:23:30] <superkuh> I appreciate the tips.
[20:23:51] <akik> alkisg: of course windows can boot in bios/mbr mode
[20:24:08] <superkuh> I think he means if it's installed in UEFI mode?
[20:24:08] <alkisg> I "just knew"; the hard part to google is "linux on bios on gpt", i.e. the bios_grub partition
[20:24:23] <alkisg> akik: see the requirements; which is bios/gpt
[20:24:42] <alkisg> The mbr is just a wrapper to gpt, it's not real mbr

[20:29:54] <msiism> Guest72: What don't you like about Devuan?
[20:29:55] <superkuh> So nvme will have linux / and probably some swap and windows. And the 8TD HDD on SATA that is accessible in BIOS/csm mode on my mobo will have the boot partitions and /home/
[20:30:40] <alkisg> superkuh: ah, so uefi from nvme, and both uefi/bios from the hdd?

[20:34:20] <alkisg> Guest72: in many distributions, programs won't install or their services won't work. You'll need a distribution that patches these programs, i.e. one that is advertised to run well without systemd

[23:43:55] <blackgatonegro> And talking about the eighties, here is a giant robot
[23:43:56] <Sayona> $$ to pay courses :))
[23:44:11] <matsaman> SrainUser: I mean, that is probably true
[23:44:15] <ayecee> some people get a job or take out a loan for that
[23:44:25] <matsaman> you can use KDE connect with any DE, of course, but
[23:44:35] <Sayona> ayecee, I don't like jobs :)
[23:44:35] <ayecee> Sayona: but as there's no courses, you don't need any $$
[23:44:35] <matsaman> historically KDE apps like to depend on a ton of KDE things
[23:44:36] <blackgatonegro> You can learn on your own but a title on a university gets you huge debt.
[23:44:40] <matsaman> which may or may not bother you; it needn't
[23:44:45] <ayecee> Sayona: well then you're going to hate courses even more.
[23:44:48] <hexnewbie> Sayona: Where do I get advertised for this sponsorship?
[23:44:54] <ayecee> Sayona: courses are like a job you don't get paid for.

[23:47:59] <SrainUser> backgatonegro: Legends say that some Windows apps aren't meant to be part of Windows
[23:48:00] <blackgatonegro> flash was really slow on dial up.
[23:48:19] <msiism> Sayona: Try text sources. Video tutorials are bloat.
[23:48:34] <blackgatonegro> So I didn't saw the point of it when an animated gif did the same abd loaded much faster.
[23:48:34] <NGC3982> doesnt df or pydf show correct file size on system using snapshots with incremental data?
[23:48:48] <SrainUser> msiism: yeah, who uses videos in 2021.
[23:48:51] <ayecee> NGC3982: how do you mean
[23:48:59] <Sayona> msiism, books?
[23:49:17] <ayecee> Sayona: no, like web pages with words instead of videos
[23:49:19] <blackgatonegro> Like people wanted a start menu in flash that took minutes to load.
[23:49:26] <msiism> Also books, though.
[23:49:42] <NGC3982> im having this issue where i rsnapshot data from a to b, and on the b machine pydf tells me that the disk space is increasing with every incremental backup even though it's unchanged incremental snaps of the same data. running ncdu tells me total size is 1,7TB, but pydf tells me 4,1TB and im not sure any longer.

[23:50:34] <NGC3982> rnsnapshot du should show me the real disk usage, right?

[23:51:28] <NGC3982> it's a built-in command in rsnapshot, the software that helps me create the incremental backups

[23:52:07] <blackgatonegro> Angry birds had a flash version.

[23:52:38] <ayecee> NGC3982: seems like it's probably accurate, sure
[23:52:59] <SrainUser> There is a project to archive old flash games: https://bluemaxima.org/flashpoint/
[23:53:00] <NGC3982> hexnewbie: sure
[23:53:17] <TheGuestMovie> NGC3982: what does "du -sh" say? It's possible the backups are done as...I forgot the name, but a sort of link that makes it appear like an original file.
[23:53:17] <ayecee> pydu would overreport the usage on an rsnapshot tree unless it were told to account for hardlinked files
[23:53:22] <blackgatonegro> SrainUser the webarchive has a huge archive of flash games
[23:53:25] <SrainUser> It's cross platform, too, so even Linux users can get in on the flash fun.

[23:54:30] <TheGuestMovie> this whole "preserving history" thing is contingent on them being actually worthwhile. Like I wouldnt care if all mobile games disappeared overnight.

[23:56:30] <TheGuestMovie> yeah, so if it's a hard link, it will show up as a real file instead of a pointer to a file, even though it doesnt take more space on the filesystem
[23:56:31] <maxzor_> Can I save the list of the packets that are installed by each apt command in a file for future use?
[23:56:36] <blackgatonegro> like cut the rope had a flash demo, then they made a html5 version with an extra level. Angry Birds best version was for Symbian, pepsi pinball is well a pinball. And I think that plants vs zombies web thing was HTML5?
[23:56:37] <ayecee> TheGuestMovie: the thing is, historians in the future don't always find the same thing important that we find important now.

[23:57:03] <TheGuestMovie> NGC3982: yeah. so not all apps are actually hardlink-aware
[23:57:08] <ayecee> maxzor_: sure, but not in an automated way.
[23:57:09] <NGC3982> TheGuestMovie: that sounds resonable. i thought df/pydf would handle such things but i guess it's not in their control
[23:57:15] <blackgatonegro> For example Apple killed lots of Iphone games when it killed 32 bits
[23:57:26] <ayecee> maxzor_: but perhaps by extracting them from the apt log
[23:57:47] <NGC3982> googling df+hardlinks exposed a very general picture of the problem im having
[23:57:49] <hexnewbie> df doesn't need to be hardlink-aware since it reads the data from statvfs() of the filesystem, where that's already taken into account. du and ncdu take hardlinks into account
