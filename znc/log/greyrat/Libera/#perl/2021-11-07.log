[04:47:24] <puff> I have a perl CGI script and module I wrote twenty years ago.  The other day something happened on my host and I started getting suexec errors.  So I finally tracked it down, the directory containing the module was world-writable (not sure how that happened, but). 
[04:47:57] <puff> So I do chmod o-w directoryname , and now I'm getting a new error: can't locate foofile.pm in @INC
[04:48:55] <puff> index.cgi does use foofile.pm, foofile.pm is in the same directory.  
[04:49:32] *** Quits: wootehfoot (~wootehfoo@user/wootehfoot) (Quit: Leaving)
[04:51:40] <puff> So either a) the chmod messed up the use statement, b) the rules for what gets automatically added to @INC changed at some point.
[04:51:53] <puff> I'm leaning more towards a) but I don't see how the chmod would interfere with that.
[04:53:41] <Grinnz> . was removed from @INC in 5.26 - you can re-add it with use lib '.'; but it's not a good idea to have relative paths in @INC, since changing current working directory breaks that and allows vulnerabilities where a module could be loaded from somewhere else
[04:54:05] <Grinnz> better idea is the "equivalent code" shown at the end of this synopsis: https://metacpan.org/pod/lib::relative
[04:54:05] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ lib::relative - Add paths relative to the current file to @INC - metacpan.org ]
[04:54:17] <aquanight> or if you can
[04:54:29] <aquanight> get your httpd to put the CGI directory in PERL5LIB
[04:54:34] <Grinnz> also an option
[04:54:39] <puff> Grinnz: Thanks.
[04:54:48] <puff> aquanight: Thank you.
[04:55:38] <Grinnz> being able to chdir to a world-writable directory is in fact how relative paths in @INC can be a vulnerability
[04:56:04] <aquanight> hmm
[04:56:43] <aquanight> how useful would it be for a pragma that ensures any .pl or .pm loaded by use/require/do has, as permissions, a subset of those of the using/requiring/doing
[04:56:52] * pragma- sneezes
[04:57:05] <Grinnz> i can't really parse that
[04:57:15] <Grinnz> you mean file permissions?
[04:57:27] <aquanight> e.g. a.pl has require 'b.pl'; the pragma would reuqire that if a.pl is not world-writable then b.pl also must not be
[04:57:44] <Grinnz> writability of the containing directory is also a potential issue
[04:57:50] <aquanight> yes
[04:57:54] <puff> To be clear, that equivalent example, is it asking for the absolute path to the directory that contains the module file?
[04:58:10] <Grinnz> yes, it's using __FILE__ to generate the absolute path to the containing directory
[04:58:12] <puff> That is, should "path/to/lib" be the absolute path to the directory that contains the module file?
[04:58:28] <aquanight> puff: File::Basename::dirname(Cwd::abs_path __FILE__) ### effectively produces the canonical absolute path to the *currently running file*
[04:58:34] <Grinnz> no, that's the path relative from your source file to the dir you want to include - since you want to add the current directory you don't need the catdir part
[04:58:38] <puff> Ah, so "path/to/lib" should be relative to wherever the file that contains that line is.
[04:58:42] <puff> Thanks.
[04:59:09] <aquanight> one thing I think can mess up the above is if the file being run can be symlinked
[04:59:09] <Grinnz> perl modules are commonly placed in a project 'lib' subdirectory, so you would use catdir to append that
[04:59:18] <puff> Thanks.
[04:59:23] <Grinnz> aquanight: abs_path resolves symlinks, that's why it's first
[04:59:29] <aquanight> ah
[04:59:31] <puff> Whee, fun editing code I haven't looked at in 20+ years.
[04:59:32] <aquanight> I thought as much
[04:59:48] <Grinnz> that's a bug in Dir::Self though, which i corrected in lib::relative and Path::This
[05:00:00] <aquanight> it occurs to me that perl does not have an interface to openat
[05:00:04] <Grinnz> ikegami pointed that out to me i think
[05:00:45] <aquanight> actually... is openat even in anything besides POSIX?
[05:01:01] <aquanight> damn
[05:01:26] <aquanight> and I think 'use POSIX;' does not have it
[05:01:31] <aquanight> sweval: use POSIX 'openat';
[05:01:32] <perlbot> aquanight: ERROR: "openat" is not exported by the POSIX module Can't continue after import errors at $BLEAD/lib/5.35.5/x86_64-linux/POSIX.pm line 192. BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at (IRC) line 1. 
[05:02:00] <aquanight> yeah openat is too new apparently

[23:04:55] <pflanze> Is it good or bad or irrelevant whether I list modules like "base", "utf8" or "NEXT" in my Makefile.PL? I don't have any version requirements on those.
[23:05:32] <gry> what are the options? "list without version requirements, or list with version requirements"?
[23:05:55] <pflanze> I currently list them with version "0".
[23:06:02] <ehuelsmann[m]> gry: that, or don'tlist them?
[23:06:22] <gry> how would the users ensure they're installed, then?
[23:06:38] <ehuelsmann[m]> 'base' and 'utf8' are core modules.
[23:06:51] <ehuelsmann[m]> every complete / sane / correct Perl install should have them.
[23:08:29] <pflanze> Debian has NEXT in perl-modules-5.32 which is Priority: standard, like perl itself. I don't know whether that also makes them automatically installed everywhere, maybe not, then my question is only about the former two.
[23:09:17] <pflanze> A Guix maintainer asked me about them, whether me listing them meant he needs to package them as dependencies from CPAN; I said no, if the test suite works with what's in the core.
[23:09:28] <pflanze> But it made me think if I go overboard with listing them.
[23:10:30] <mst> pflanze: some people list core modules, some people only list some core modules (e.g. skipping 'strict'), some people mostly only list non-core stuff and hope the things they need never get removed from core
[23:10:55] <pflanze> Potential removal from core is actually an interesting point.
[23:10:56] <mst> I tend to list things that are dual life when I remember but assume core-only modules are probably safe
[23:11:10] <pflanze> I think I'll just leave it as is then.
[23:11:24] <mst> like 'strict' is always going to be core but lots of people assumed 'CGI' would always be core and, uh, nope
[23:11:35] <pflanze> Hehe
[23:12:20] <mst> the only disadvantage I've seen in practice of enumerating everything is that occasionally somebody will get confused and think "this clearly has lots of dependencies so I'm not going to use it" because it hasn't occurred to them to check if that's actually true
[23:14:08] <mst> ok, when somebody lists 'strict', it also means that somebody like me will go "*blink* ... seriously?" but I don't think "making mst think you're erring on the side of excessively pedantic" is something any author should actually give a flying fuck about so that doesn't count as a disadvantage (and depending on how much you enjoy trolling me may actually be the opposite ;)
[23:14:25] <pflanze> I'm not listing "strict" :)
[23:14:42] <pflanze> There's "warnings", through :P
[23:15:07] <pflanze> I guess I'll remove that one.
[23:15:09] <mst> http://trout.me.uk/mstcat3.jpg
[23:16:27] <pflanze> You always seem to have some computers in the background, either you've got cats for real, or that's photoshopped!
[23:17:32] <pflanze> I prefer to think this is real!
[23:18:34] <mst> this one's mine: http://trout.me.uk/grump.jpg
[23:19:16] <pflanze> Neat! Only some mess in the background :)
[23:19:28] <mst> she is absolutely wonderful although also the single dumbest cat I have ever loved
[23:21:08] <pflanze> I don't have a cat although I've tended to a cat of my parents for some time, super nice, and probably smarter than I think.
[23:21:31] <pflanze> But then I don't know.
[23:25:13] <xenu> i wouldn't be surprised if 'base' gets removed at some point
[23:27:34] <xenu> there's a better alternative in core (parent.pm) and it's already dual life
[23:28:03] <pflanze> Thanks for the hint.
