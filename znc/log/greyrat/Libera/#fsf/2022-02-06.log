[03:05:41] <jacobk> I think this means that, if you want to allow anyone access to the program remotely, you must publish the "Service Source Code" to everyone, not just users, which makes it illegal for small groups of people to use modified versions remotely privately.

[03:06:41] <sjxs> ok thanks for replying
[03:07:35] <sjxs> a free software license in my understanding is not a legal term but a philosophical term which means any license that guarantees the freedom of the users
[03:11:04] <sjxs> that's why there are in my understanding licenses free software licenses not compatible with the GPL. What do those licenses have in common with GPL? It's that they protect the interests of the user from the whims of the developer

[03:17:22] <jacobk> White_Flame: By "use modified versions remotely privately", I meant using modified versions without publicizing the modifications made.
[03:17:38] <White_Flame> right, that's against the license, but I don't see how that makes it non-free
[03:17:47] <jacobk> A requirement to publish modified versions to everyone lets everyone know that you are using the software.
[03:17:49] <White_Flame> it doesn't limit your right to _use_ the software in any way you please
[03:17:57] <jacobk> This might be applicable: https://wiki.debian.org/DissidentTest
[03:18:09] <White_Flame> it only lets everyone know that you've modified it.  if you don't, then nobody knows
[03:18:25] <tpefreedom> Has the FSF weighed in? Has GNU?
[03:18:25] <White_Flame> *if you don't modify it,
[03:19:21] <jacobk> tpefreedom: no
[03:19:28] <jacobk> At least, I don't think so
[03:20:12] <jacobk> White_Flame: In the course of using software, people might want to modify it. If they need to fix a bug, for example.
[03:20:21] <White_Flame> sure
[03:20:34] <jacobk> From a link on the DissidentTest page: "It must be possible for chinese programmer dissidents to modify the software and distribute their modifications to their friends without entailing extra risk that their modifications must be publicized to the world." - https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2002/12/msg00227.html
[03:21:23] <White_Flame> is that part of "free software" vs not though?
[03:21:44] <White_Flame> or just that they have to be careful beyond the viral freedom effects of licenses?

[03:23:55] <jacobk> I think this would fall under freedom 3.
[03:24:19] <White_Flame> how so?
[03:24:22] <jacobk> "You should also have the freedom to make modifications and use them privately in your own work or play, without even mentioning that they exist. If you do publish your changes, you should not be required to notify anyone in particular, or in any particular way." - https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html#content
[03:24:44] <White_Flame> if people are forced to work in anonymous ways, anonymously publishing their changes is also part of that
[03:25:28] <White_Flame> else it's kind of a security-by-obscurity argument
[03:26:36] *** Joins: aHick (~memes@143.60.229.4)
[03:28:06] <White_Flame> different libre licenses would affect users' decisions in different ways, whether or not they want to abide.  else there'd only be 1 libre license
[03:31:39] <jacobk> Anonymous is not the same as private. A group of people could be working together and know each other, even if they don't want those outside the group to know they are using the software (e.g. if the software is illegal for some reason).
[03:32:10] <White_Flame> right, this server license removes privacy of changes.  I don't see how that makes it non-free, though
[03:32:14] <White_Flame> it's just a different free license
[03:33:01] <White_Flame> and it's not about people outside knowing they're using it (they don't if it's actually only used privately), it's about people outside knowing about the changes
[03:33:10] <White_Flame> and only the changes, not who made it
[03:34:16] *** Joins: xiews (~wxie@101.93.17.62)
[03:35:06] <jacobk> Publishing changes without revealing who made the changes could be risky. If the network is a local network instead of the internet, hiding the fact that the software is being used while publishing the source code to everyone who connects to the network could be impossible.
[03:35:20] <jacobk> IMO the freedom to use/copy/modify software privately is important.
[03:35:43] <White_Flame> sorry, I can't really parse that
[03:36:05] <White_Flame> this is about public publishing, not AGPL-style publishing to only those who connect to it?
[03:36:38] <jacobk> White_Flame: Yes, requiring publishing source code only to people you're already interacting with is fine.
[03:37:12] <White_Flame> I don't understand the impossible situation you posited
[03:37:34] <jacobk> I'll try to explain it better, but it might take a minute
[03:37:52] <White_Flame> people use software on a lan, nobody knows they're using it.  There's a public posted diff somewhere on the internet with their changes, not with any names or anything
[03:44:49] *** Quits: tpefreedom (~tpefreedo@user/tpefreedom) (Remote host closed the connection)
[03:45:09] *** Joins: tpefreedom (~tpefreedo@user/tpefreedom)
[03:45:09] <jacobk> Suppose there's a local network of several people, who use a modified version of SSPL-licensed software over this local network.
[03:45:09] <jacobk> The software is run by a single individual ("the host"), and everyone else uses the software remotely, using login information given by the host.
[03:45:09] <jacobk> Suppose their access to the internet is non-existant or severely limited (censorship, port blocking, whatever), and suppose the software they are using is illegal for some reason.
[03:45:09] <jacobk> The host doesn't mind sharing source code with people who he gave permission to use the software, but because of the SSPL, he has to share the source code with everyone on the network.
[03:45:09] <jacobk> Because the source code download now doesn't require authentication, anyone (perhaps someone working for the government) can guess that somebody on that network is using the illegal software.
[03:45:11] <jacobk> If there's no anonymiztion layer (e.g. something like Tor), then any outside observer can probably pinpoint the exact machine hosting the server.
[03:46:07] <White_Flame> hold on
[03:46:20] <White_Flame> I don't see how that comes from the license, I'd have to re-read it
[03:47:39] <jacobk> "If you make the functionality of the Program or a modified version available to third parties as a service, you must make the Service Source Code available via network download to everyone at no charge"
[03:48:08] <White_Flame> right, that has nothing to do with your private lan
[03:48:16] <White_Flame> it doesn't have to be hosted internally
[03:48:38] <White_Flame> since that's not "everyone", the internet is assumed to be available to everyone
[03:49:11] <White_Flame> (since "everyone' is not a defined term in the license)
[03:49:46] <jacobk> If "everyone" means source code must be published on the internet, then the license is obviously nonfree, since some people might not have internet.
[03:50:07] <White_Flame> "available by network" is the discriminating factor of the license
[03:50:28] <White_Flame> it is not a violation of this license to not make concessions of availability outside networking
[03:51:29] <White_Flame> I don't know how many steps of availability it is for the most disconnected person to have internet content made avialable to them through their peers
[03:52:28] <jacobk> I think "available by network" is fine; I think network could even mean a network of people sharing USB drives.
[03:52:57] <jacobk> I don't know what you mean by "it is not a violation of this license to not make concessions of availability outside networking".
[03:53:43] <White_Flame> ignoring non-computer-networked people does not violate this license
[03:54:02] <jacobk> Oh yeah, that makes sense.
[03:54:11] <White_Flame> and certainly that's the practical case with most GPL software
[03:54:38] <White_Flame> where there's no concessions made to those without internet access; it's left to the non-networked person to get a copy somehow
[03:55:03] <White_Flame> eg, no addresses are given to make requests for mailed media, etc
[03:55:31] <White_Flame> and is there much anonymously written, GPL licensed code?
[03:56:00] <White_Flame> because honoring requests for non-digital media would poke into these sorts of privacy/anonymity issues as well
[03:56:21] <White_Flame> erm, non-electronic media
[03:56:32] <White_Flame> or whatever the right term is :-P
[03:56:33] <jacobk> No, just send the source code as part of the non-electronic media.
[03:57:00] <White_Flame> how anonymous is that when you have physical artifacts?
[03:57:26] <jacobk> If you're distributing a binary through physical artifacts anyway, I don't see what the problem is.
[03:57:29] <White_Flame> tracking those back to who bought the mailer, etc, are the same sorts of issues as tracking who publicly uploaded the sspl code
[03:58:06] <White_Flame> so if it's fine for GPL to make it difficult to stay anonymous, I don't think the SSPL changes that factor much at all, GPL might even be a bit more difficult
[03:59:19] <White_Flame> requesting physical media is likely an easy DoS attack against GPL authors, and if they request fees for the media, that's really hard to keep anonymous
[03:59:47] <jacobk> The GPL doesn't make it difficult to stay anonymous. You always have the option to include the source code with the binary instead of offering to send source code later, right?
[04:00:15] <White_Flame> that's a circular argument now with SSPL, that distribution somehow makes you deanonymized?
[04:00:33] <White_Flame> if it's okay for GPL to anonymously post code publicly, then so is it with SSPL
[04:00:47] <jacobk> The GPL doesn't ever require that you distribute source code to anyone you didn't give a binary to.
[04:01:15] <jacobk> And the AGPL doesn't ever require that you distribute source code to anyone who you didn't let use the program.
[04:01:34] <White_Flame> sure, but taht doesn't change any of the argued dynamics that supposedly weigh against SSPL
[04:01:58] <White_Flame> the requirements of SSPL do not deanonymize people in troubled situations
[04:04:56] <Noisytoot> Has the FSF reviewed the SSPL?
[04:05:00] <jacobk> If you always distribute source code with binaries or with program access, then you don't lose any privacy, whereas if you have to interact with everyone instead of just who you choose to interact with, you lose a lot of privacy (depending on some factors that may be out of the user's control).
[04:05:12] <jacobk> Noisytoot: It's not on their list of licenses, so I think not.

[09:42:58] <tpefreedom> The only problem with my usb wifi adapter is that debian's fully free images even though it works on fully free distros (like tirsquel, parabola, guix). I have to insntall the firmware image and then uninstall all of the garbage.
[09:44:12] <jxself> Is it ath9k_htc?
[09:44:46] <tpefreedom> yup
[09:45:04] <jxself> The free firmware for that finally ended up in Debian. It only took years. Look for firmware-ath9k-htc.
[09:45:36] <tpefreedom> but iirc it isn't automatically shipped in normal images
[09:45:38] <jxself> For the longest time they didn't have it and continued with the nonfree firmware in the nonfree section instead. FOr years.
[09:46:03] <jxself> Maybe; I don't know that piece. Maybe submit a wishlist thing to be added?
[09:46:40] <tpefreedom> I'm guessing that's one of the reasons a lot of the GNU and FSF crowd has such mixed feelings about debian.
[09:47:10] <Andrew> I'm ok with that
[09:47:18] <jxself> In the meantime it "just" meets completing the install with ethernet right? Then then installing the firmware and then unplugging.
[09:47:28] <jxself> means, not meets
[09:48:00] <damo22> you can install the firmware onto a usb stick and continue the installation with nonfree firmware
[09:49:10] <jxself> But who wants nonfree junk? The free firmware should be used. :)
[09:49:16] <damo22> free*
[09:49:45] <damo22> i mean if the free fw is missing you can put it on a stick and make the installer use it
[09:50:24] <jxself> If I recall that only works in specific cases where the installer somehow recognizes or knows that a firmware's needed. It's not clear it works in all cases.
[09:50:36] <jxself> tpefreedom: Does the installer actually mention or ask for a firmware?
[09:51:23] <tpefreedom> I have not tried the normal installer in a while so idk if they've finally fixed it

[16:07:05] <labrador> GNUHacker, did you read my message -_-
[16:07:30] <GNUHacker> labrador: is encrypted correctly
[16:07:43] <labrador> Hmm no,look at this
[16:07:49] <irc_standardnick> GNUHacker, I think I have used one distro one that list; Trisquel OS
[16:08:36] <GNUHacker> irc_standardnick: trisquel is a nice libre distro, also Parabola

[16:09:16] <labrador> Its hard to read but this GNUHacker ^
[16:09:31] <Andrew> GNUHacker: Gentoo with strict ACCEPT_LICENSE flags constitutes a free distro
[16:09:57] <irc_standardnick> Parabola is basically an easy to use Gentoo distro, right?
[16:10:17] <GNUHacker> Andrew uh? i cant find gentoo in the libre distros list created by the FSF https://gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html
[16:10:42] <Andrew> GNUHacker: I know, that's because there is an official way to install nonfree software, but I disable it, so it is free
[16:11:06] <labrador> GNUHacker, so basically there's no mention of ewwegweg's key anywhere
[16:11:12] <labrador> He cannot read this message
[16:11:32] <GNUHacker> irc_standardnick: parabola is arch like, is more updated than trisquel
[16:11:46] <Andrew> https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:AMD64/Installation/Base#Optional:_Configuring_the_ACCEPT_LICENSE_variable
[16:12:06] <GNUHacker> Andrew dont tell that to me, tell to FSF
[16:12:11] <GNUHacker> https://gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html
[16:12:26] <labrador> They won't recommend debian even tho its totally seperate
[16:12:29] <Andrew> GNUHacker: Gentoo still won't count, because you can edit the configs to make it accept nonfree software
[16:12:34] <labrador> No way for gentoo to be there
[16:12:49] <labrador> Anyway GNUHacker fix your encryption pls
[16:12:50] <GNUHacker> debian have non-free repos and maintain that repos
[16:12:53] <Andrew> labrador: Gentoo's repo isn't toally seperate, but the configs would cause nonfree ones to be rejected
[16:13:08] <labrador> Andrew, and they reject debian which is even better
[16:13:13] <Andrew> Better?
[16:13:18] <labrador> Why would you expect gentoo to pass
[16:13:25] <labrador> Andrew, better as in total separation
[16:13:32] <labrador> Instead of this mixed repo
[16:13:43] <Andrew> Well that's right, but it's the same for the end user
[16:13:52] * Andrew invites DiffieHellman to the conversation
[16:13:53] <labrador> Andrew, well kinda true
[16:14:23] <labrador> Oh hey I finally understand DiffieHellman well
[16:14:27] <labrador> Thats good for me
[16:14:30] <Andrew> lol
[16:14:42] <labrador> As in the real DH exchange...
[16:14:44] <labrador> lol
[16:15:11] <Andrew> I mean, I thought you mean you understand DiffieHellman's use of Gentoo GNU/OpenRC/Linux
[16:15:23] <Andrew> Nah, I guess the OpenRC/ isn't necessary because it's a really small part
[16:15:34] <Andrew> (Unlike systemd in some other systems)

[16:15:59] <labrador> Andrew, nah real DH is even cooler than DiffieHellman's use of gentoo
[16:16:25] <labrador> Like think of it,a key generation with no encryption
[16:16:28] <Andrew> lol that's unrelated
[16:16:34] <labrador> Boggled my mind when I first heard of that
[16:16:50] <Andrew> I actually hand-calculated DH on paper before to encrypt conversations with classmates at school
[16:17:04] *** Quits: eric15342335 (~123er@user/eric15342335) (Quit: Leaving.)
[16:17:23] <labrador> Andrew, uhh good...how large were your g,p and a,b
[16:17:30] <labrador> Also how did you generate g,p?
[16:17:45] <Andrew> Prime number tables in the math book
[16:17:50] <labrador> hmm
[16:17:57] <Andrew> I mean, it was at school, so those resources existed :P
[16:17:58] <labrador> That would be easily crackable
[16:18:08] <labrador> not becuz the primes re small
[16:18:18] <labrador> But because the primes are not sofia-something primes
[16:18:28] <labrador> They need to be in a special group for good security
[16:18:42] <Andrew> I understand
[16:18:45] <labrador> Thats why people just use pre-generated primes instead of risking generating them
[16:18:50] <labrador> Its hard to make a good one
[16:18:57] <Andrew> but when nobody around me have calculators
[16:19:01] <Andrew> That's quite good actually
[16:19:05] <labrador> hmm true
[16:19:17] <Andrew> (Of course since it's real life I'd use shared secrets instead, but that's just fun)
[16:19:32] <leonarth> there's really just a handful of free distros?
[16:19:34] <labrador> Andrew, isn't the DH for generating said shared secret
[16:19:48] <labrador> leonarth, yeah
[16:19:56] <leonarth> then all major distros use proprietary sw
[16:19:58] <Andrew> * I'd whisper the shared secret in person
[16:20:01] <labrador> lmao
[16:20:03] <Andrew> leonarth: Of course
[16:20:22] <labrador> Debian the most popular distro is famously not recognized
[16:20:36] <leonarth> Debian uses proprietary sw?
[16:20:40] <labrador> It has like endless children,every day a new fork of debian comes up
[16:20:41] <GNUHacker> yes
[16:20:42] <Andrew> leonarth: If you enable a repository
[16:20:44] <labrador> leonarth, has non free repos
[16:20:49] <Andrew> GNUHacker: Not by default
[16:20:49] <labrador> I have them enabled
[16:20:49] <GNUHacker> debian maintain non-free repos
[16:20:54] <GNUHacker> and promote this
[16:20:57] <Andrew> labrador: Bad 
[16:21:03] <leonarth> if I install a fresh debian11 is all free unless I install non-free
[16:21:11] *** Joins: Guest36 (~Guest36@78-27-66-181.bb.dnainternet.fi)
[16:21:21] <Andrew> leonarth: Until you enable the `contrib' repository
[16:21:25] <labrador> Andrew, eh I needed to install fw to remove several error messages from my dmesg log
[16:21:27] <GNUHacker> the optional freedom is not enough
[16:21:28] <labrador> Andrew, and non free
[16:21:46] <leonarth> ok so I can just debian w/o enabling contrib and I'm still free
[16:21:51] <labrador> yes
[16:21:59] <Andrew> I do have a contrib package on my Debian server, but it's a free one
[16:22:06] <Andrew> Namely matrix-synapse-py3
[16:22:12] <Andrew> (Don't crack my homeserver, thank you!)
[16:22:16] <labrador> Andrew, the package probably depends on nonfree stuff
[16:22:17] <Andrew> leonarth: That's right
[16:22:20] <Andrew> labrador: Nope
[16:22:22] <labrador> Thats why its there in the first place
[16:22:35] <labrador> Andrew, then why would it be in contrib instead of main -_-
[16:22:37] <GNUHacker> labrador: i dont understand the mail problem, tell me it in an extended mail
[16:22:42] *** Quits: belgin (~belgin@5-12-77-45.residential.rdsnet.ro) (Quit: Leaving)
[16:22:46] <labrador> ok GNUHacker 
[16:22:47] <Andrew> Good question
[16:22:50] <leonarth> so what's considered a free distro is one w/o the possibility of enabling non-free
[16:23:02] <labrador> leonarth, yeah but even that isnt true most of the time
[16:23:06] <labrador> For instance with guix
[16:23:09] <labrador> There's non-guix
[16:23:14] <labrador> A non free repo for guix
[16:23:20] <Andrew> Anyway, I don't need Matrix now, I'll just remove it
[16:23:29] <labrador> You'll get kicked out ofc if you mention it in #guix
[16:23:38] <leonarth> e.g. if I install PureOS I can still install whatever is maintained by debian
[16:23:40] <labrador> But everyone knows about it
[16:23:48] <Andrew> No non-free or contrib packages installed on andrewyu.org!  rms would be proud.
[16:23:49] <Andrew> Yay
[16:25:05] <GNUHacker> people that promote distros with optional non-free software when we have fully free distros without non-free software in the FSF channel
[16:25:59] <leonarth> ok so for personal use I should change my debian11 w/ pureos
[16:26:37] <Andrew> GNUHacker: When you do not enable it, it is a free distro.  I like the source-based packages of Gentoo because I do not trust binary packages and simply because I like Portage.
[16:26:38] <labrador> GNUHacker, (;-__-)
[16:26:55] <labrador> Andrew, why do you not trust ninary packages
[16:26:56] <leonarth> which distro you guys run?
[16:26:59] <labrador> Makes no sense
[16:27:14] <labrador> leonarth, debian. Andrew runs gentoo. So does DiffieHellman.
[16:27:18] <Andrew> labrador: It's harder to verify if a maintainer put in something funny during compilation
[16:27:19] <labrador> I dunno what GNUHacker runs
[16:27:28] * irc_standardnick is dual booting Devuan and Manjaro currently
[16:28:02] <Andrew> leonarth: You don't reply to VERSION now? Hmm
[16:28:33] <labrador> Andrew, hmm but does your computer verify wether the source portage gets is equal to the one hosted on say github
[16:28:40] <labrador> Andrew, I don't too
[16:29:11] <Andrew> github lol
[16:29:42] <labrador> Well wherever the dev hosts the repos
[16:29:45] <labrador> Probably githu
[16:29:45] <Andrew> Of course you can, I just send SIGINT after it downloads stuff and before it compiles stuff and look in stuff
[16:30:00] <Andrew> By the way, please tell people to try to stop using GitHub
[16:30:00] <labrador> Andrew, you won't really catch malware in that way
[16:30:15] <labrador> You need to generate a diff for each file from the ones on the repos
[16:30:21] <leonarth> [15:00] -Andrew CTCP- VERSION Impossible Client
[16:30:23] <labrador> Or just use arch
[16:30:35] <Andrew> No
[16:30:40] <labrador> Whose aur gets stuff from the real dev repos
[16:30:49] <leonarth> Andrew and use what, gitlab?
[16:30:50] <Andrew> Also, another reason I like Gentoo:
[16:30:53] <Andrew> USE flags
[16:30:58] <labrador> Andrew, just saying that right now you're just playing stupid security theatre
[16:31:02] <AwesomeAdam54321> leonarth: There's Codeberg
[16:31:14] <AwesomeAdam54321> and Sourcehut
[16:31:21] <Andrew> leonarth: Host your own Git server, use Savannah, Codeberg, notabug, etc
[16:31:42] <labrador> See for software there would be gitlab(best),gitea,srht
[16:31:52] <leonarth> kinda hard to get ppl to collaborate on your own git server
[16:31:57] <Andrew> labrador: Try using GitLab without nonfree Javascript
[16:31:59] <Andrew> leonarth: Why?
[16:32:06] <Andrew> Use git-send-email?
[16:32:15] <labrador> Andrew, you can. The CE is free javascript
[16:32:15] <leonarth> nobody wants to make an account on my gitlab server
[16:32:19] <Andrew> Or git send-email, as it is on most computers
[16:32:51] <labrador> Andrew, only boomers use that
[16:32:54] <Andrew> labrador: Nice, but (1) The JS licenses are unobvious, LibreJS didn't find it and (2) why would it require JavaScript to display things anyways?
[16:32:59] <Andrew> labrador: Then I'm a boomer, thank you :)
[16:33:00] <labrador> Normal people use the webui
[16:33:27] <leonarth> so kernel devs are not normal labrador ? :)
[16:33:35] <Andrew> leonarth: Nope :)
[16:33:39] <labrador> Andrew, 1) Librejs does not find may things
[16:33:47] <labrador> 2) Because it does a lot of stuff
[16:33:54] <labrador> Its basically on par with github
[16:34:00] <Andrew> Host your own Gitea
[16:34:01] <labrador> Which is a hard mark to pass
[16:34:08] <Andrew> Well fine
[16:34:10] <labrador> Andrew, gitea is way way worse in features
[16:34:32] <Andrew> /hook add pre-send-message text.append(" :)")
[16:34:34] <Andrew> oops
[16:34:41] <Andrew> That's right :)
[16:34:55] <leonarth> let's see which institutions took gitlab shares during funding rounds
[16:35:07] <Andrew> leonarth: That's a good point :)
[16:35:26] <GNUHacker> i run fully free distros https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html
[16:35:27] <leonarth> if blackrock is there then we know who rules :)
[16:35:33] <GNUHacker> guix and trisquel
[16:35:43] <leonarth> GNUHacker you tried pureos?
[16:35:56] <GNUHacker> but i'll chage from guix to parabola
[16:36:02] <labrador> leonarth, don't use a no-name distro
[16:36:08] <labrador> It'll be hard to get support
[16:36:10] <GNUHacker> i dont tried pureos, but pureos look nice
[16:36:11] <Andrew> no-name? :)
[16:36:19] <labrador> Unless you can do your own support...
[16:36:35] <Andrew> GNUHacker: As long as I get the ethical aspects under control, i.e. via ACCEPT_LICENSE, I'm okay with it.  Then I'll try to find the best one in terms of the technology. :)
[16:36:46] <leonarth> Khosla and YCombinator own gitlab
[16:36:55] <Andrew> YCombinator sounds functional. :)
[16:37:03] <labrador> Andrew, the best in terms of tech is gitlab...also a pain to host.
[16:37:15] <Andrew> Yes, it is a pain to host. :)
[16:37:17] <labrador> Like it hits hard on resources man
[16:37:25] <Andrew> I don't think it's the best in terms of tech. :)
[16:37:27] <leonarth> Goldman sachs joined in round E
[16:37:42] <labrador> I hate too big to fail banks 
[16:37:47] <GNUHacker> dont use microsoft github or gitlab, use https://notabug.org or https://codeberg.org
[16:37:48] <labrador> Like goldman sachs
[16:37:59] <labrador> GNUHacker, both are deficient in features
[16:38:03] <GNUHacker> sure
[16:38:10] <labrador> Gitea is about 5 years behind gitlab
[16:38:14] <leonarth> can you find LKM rootkits on codeberg? :)
[16:38:35] <GNUHacker> labrador: which features concretelly?
[16:39:11] <leonarth> nice, already plenty of projects on codeberg
[16:39:22] *** Joins: fr33domlover (~fr33@31.210.181.138)
[16:39:45] <labrador> GNUHacker, its kinda like the difference between the feature sets of say libreoffice sheets and ms excel. Both look about the same from the distance but an experienced user will be inefficent in sheets.
[16:40:00] <labrador> Same with gitlab and gitea..except both are free
[16:40:06] <leonarth> guix is on codabug
[16:40:19] <labrador> leonarth, wait wasn't it on savannah?
[16:40:25] <labrador> Its a gnu project
[16:40:27] <leonarth> I found it on notabug
[16:40:29] <labrador> oh
[16:40:33] <Andrew> labrador:  Firstly, any of those are a more ethical choice than GitHub.  Secondly, well, I prefer self-hosting.  When it's possible to host my own stuff in order to share it, though using other people's services aren't strictly SaaSS, I don't find a good reason to do so.  Thirdly, I consider GitHub, GitLab, Gitea and gogs inferior to plain repositories technology-wise, because they (1) are too
[16:40:35] <Andrew> complicated, (2) do not work well with standard UNIX-like utilities, such as UNIX pipes and mail and ssh, and (3) mostly require a Web interface to operate :)
[16:40:51] <leonarth> oo nice name for next git server codabug.run :)
[16:41:09] <GNUHacker> notabug.org + codeberg.org = codabug lol
[16:41:31] <labrador> Andrew, when you start developing stuff you'll realize that the complications are not just for its sake
[16:41:34] <leonarth> lol GNUHacker 
[16:41:38] <Andrew> Of course there are people who want to use a Web interface, so I use a standard post-receive Git hook to generate a static site using stagit that gets deployed to /var/www/git.andrewyu.org. :)
[16:41:54] <Andrew> labrador: What am I missing? :)
[16:41:58] <labrador> And you can self host all of them
[16:42:24] <Andrew> labrador: Self hosting is possible for everything that you talked about except for GitHub, true. :)
[16:42:25] <leonarth> we'll mirror everything in notabug.org + codeberg.org into codabug.com
[16:42:28] <labrador> Andrew, work on a real project first...maybe apache's or something. Those features are handy
[16:42:29] <GNUHacker> Andrew has u hosted savane?
[16:42:35] <labrador> When working on large projects
[16:42:44] <Andrew> GNUHacker: I was about to try, when I discovered that it required PHP, so I stopped there. :)
[16:42:57] <labrador> Andrew, almost every webserver uses php
[16:42:57] *** Quits: myzhang1029 (~Thunderbi@64.251.74.34) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[16:42:58] <labrador> And java
[16:43:21] <GNUHacker> Andrew right, have many features, require php to the mail daemon and other stuff
[16:43:35] <leonarth> both nota and berg lack repository discovery capabilities
[16:43:40] <Andrew> labrador: We'll see.  However can you explain what features I need during development?  I believe that hook scripts for mbsync is enough, and it incorporates well into the rest of my Operating System. :)
[16:43:43] <leonarth> you need that to move ppl from github
[16:43:55] <Andrew> labrador: Java on the Web, thank you. :)
[16:44:27] <GNUHacker> but is nice savane, have many features, like mail list, multiple CVS (not git only), discussion forums...
[16:44:28] <labrador> Andrew, spring and other java frameworks are not just to look at y'know
[16:44:40] <labrador> Andrew, hook scripts get real complicated
[16:44:44] <Andrew> If I have to, I'd rather write it in a functional language with CGI. :)

[16:51:14] <DiffieHellman> Nvm that a firewall with the right settings does everything NAT does security wise, except in a way not so easily bypassible.
[16:51:23] <Andrew> lol
[16:51:40] <Andrew> Also it makes letting others connect to your computer much less of a hassle.
[16:52:11] <Andrew> Sadly, China Telecom is really idiosyncratic when it comes to IPv6 support---no IPv6 support.
[16:52:14] <DiffieHellman> I can't wait til IPv6 is required and ISP's start charging per /128 and NATting em all
[16:52:53] <Andrew> They put everyone under a CGNAT by default, but they give you a public IP on request.
[16:53:14] <DiffieHellman> China made IPv8 or something, but can't int 6
[16:53:29] <Andrew> What IPv8?
[16:53:37] <Andrew> However some ports (namely 22, 80, 443 and 445) are blocked, eww.
[16:53:44] <DiffieHellman> The great fireall doesn't support IPv6?
[16:54:14] <DiffieHellman> Some chinese university made a version of IP with more bits than IPv5
[16:54:18] <DiffieHellman> *6
[16:54:21] <Andrew> We don't know anything about the Great Firewall here, it's not transparent.
[16:54:27] <labrador> NATs aren't for security
[16:54:34] <Andrew> DiffieHellman: I don't think that's really hard anyway...
[16:54:39] <labrador> They are for extending IPv4 address
[16:54:40] <labrador> es
