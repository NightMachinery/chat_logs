[03:39:57] <PenguinMan98> Similar, yes. But you can see that I have a variable-height video div above the container.
[03:40:31] <PenguinMan98> So I can't fix the height of the container
[03:40:49] <FunkyBob> I don't think, from memory, that this depends on a fixed height container
[03:41:04] <PenguinMan98> Have a look at the pen then
[03:42:14] <PenguinMan98> See if you can spot anything obvious I screwed up
[03:42:51] <FunkyBob> yeah, ok.. so have adjusted things so it doesn't fit vertically...
[03:43:07] <FunkyBob> there's no reason for it to scroll, as there's no reason for it not to just keep growing
[03:43:14] <FunkyBob> no container is affecting a height limit

[03:49:39] <PenguinMan98> Oooooh
[03:56:39] <FunkyBob> some of thse changes weren't essential... but when I use flex, I like to use it for all
[03:56:51] <FunkyBob> that is, use flex-basis instead if width/height, and so on
[03:57:04] <FunkyBob> it emphasises to future me that this element is involved in a fled layout
[04:02:09] <lantech19446> FunkyBob: you're usually a voice of wisdom, would you mind taking a look at my code?
[04:02:40] <FunkyBob> don't ask to ask... just ask :)
[04:04:00] <lantech19446> I want my three input fields stacked vertically on the right side of the page and the picture on the left, I tried using flex and i just can't get it the way I want it but i've never used flex yet so I don't know where I'm going wrong
[04:04:00] <lantech19446> https://github.com/jherman19446/form
[04:06:39] <PenguinMan98> Grr. I'm trying to implement your fix from the pen into my code and it's not working. It's collapsed my chat to 0px tall
[04:06:58] <lantech19446> that's odd
[04:07:55] <FunkyBob> PenguinMan98: how many changes have you made?
[04:08:10] <FunkyBob> not just the one with flex: 1 1 0; I hope?
[04:08:46] <PenguinMan98> I'm trying to diff your code with mine and adjust.
[04:09:57] <PenguinMan98> I'm curious why you added a margin: 0 on body
[04:10:19] <FunkyBob> iirc I also moved the overflow to the parent of where it was
[04:10:32] <FunkyBob> PenguinMan98: personal preference... to make sure your 100VH fit within the viewport
[04:11:52] <PenguinMan98> On the video-block, I don't specify a height in my actual code. It's just as tall as the video pane
[04:12:15] <FunkyBob> sure, but the other block needs to be allowed to flex
[04:12:36] <FunkyBob> and should start with a size of 0 so it can't start larger than the screen / parent
[04:13:01] <FunkyBob> so flex: 1 1 0;   grow/shrink at 1, basis 0
[04:13:09] <FunkyBob> (so really, the shrink is redundant)

[10:02:16] <Rockwood> it depends how random you want them... you could asign them to a grid, then they each load at a bit random position inside their own reserved cell/space never overlap and still be "random". if you want them to be fully random you will need to add the position, and size into an array and calculate for each image if he is not @ the same coords of a previous image. no idea if something like this has been put into a plugin before though

[19:15:19] <jplejacq> @phryk, the spec specifically says that vw does not take scrollbars into account. https://drafts.csswg.org/css-values-3/#viewport-relative-lengths

[22:04:35] <FlorianBad> Is there anything evil or that could cause problems in setting a div as inline-block in order to use it just like a float:left but without the need to have a clear element afterwards?
[22:04:54] <FlorianBad> (I'm talking about a large wrapper div)

[22:07:22] <FlorianBad> I did, I mean it's pretty producible. What I'm concerned about is not what it looks like in one case but the what-I-see-is-all-there-is bias.
[22:07:46] <FlorianBad> because that's how things break when we scale them
[22:09:58] <Rockwood_> i am not good in english after see the code i can try to help

[22:22:22] <lantech19446> I've run into a predicament, There's something I want centered on the page but justified right and apparently both of those are accomplished with text-align how do I make it acknowledge both in the manner in which I want it too?

[23:08:16] <lantech19446> I have input fields I want them centered on the page but I want to have the ends of the field even on the right side
[23:09:50] <nbjoerg> so wrap them in a div?
[23:11:49] <lantech19446> how is that going to allow me to center them AND justify right?
[23:12:08] <nbjoerg> you center the outer div and justify right inside it?
[23:13:06] <lantech19446> ok I'll give it a shot
[23:18:06] <lantech19446> ok had to fuck with margins too for a second but it worked thank you
