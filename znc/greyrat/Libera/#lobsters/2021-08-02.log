[00:04:29] <rwb> i'm digging the idea of a single thread dispatching stuff to the other threads
[00:04:35] <rwb> single event handler thread*
[00:05:02] <klardotsh> so, I've been mulling an idea lately and trying to see whether I actually want to write a backing impl for this thing. if anyone's bored and wants to give idea feedback (it's Sunday, I'll even take "total shite, 0/10" tbh, that's fair), here's the start of my brainstorm of a "semi declarative Linux definition for FHS-compliant distros" tool config https://github.com/klardotsh/oof/blob/main/examples/alpine/system.oof
[00:05:32] <rwb> first of all 10/10 name
[00:06:37] <rwb> >booleans are "yes|y", "no|n", and "maybe|m"... which makes them not actually booleans, I'm well aware. binaries are overrated.

[00:07:31] <rwb> maybe (hehe) instead of "maybe" you should add an if-recommended or something like that, idk
[00:07:33] <rwb> what's the intent of the maybe?
[00:07:58] <klardotsh> rwb: hah, I didn't have a better word for it at the time (that was late at night), but there's cases where a 3-way toggle is useful: that particular line is trying to convey a user intent of "install ZSH completion if my distro provides it, don't error if it doesn't"
[00:08:00] <Brekkjern> "Ask me again if it needs clarification?"
[00:08:09] <rwb> klardotsh: then if-provided

[00:09:12] <rwb> --no-error-when-missing could be a better name
[00:09:15] <klardotsh> rwb: fair enough. that's a good callout. expanded, my intent there was "make a best effort to install all of these, and if one fails or doesn't exist, whatever"
[00:09:20] <klardotsh> rwb: that name is definitely better, thank you!
[00:10:05] <rwb> if there is more than one condition in which the user could choose not to error, you could do it like: --if-missing=error/warning/silent --if-couldnt-install=error/warning/silent
[00:10:30] <klardotsh> I like this. gets me out of the silly y|n|m conundrum for toggles too

[01:47:45] <iDrougge> Only trivial programs are portable.
[01:49:05] <bsandro> I mean for the existing codebase
[01:49:46] <bsandro> imagine linux kernel hardwiring some of its internals to rust; it immediately dies on ppc, alpha and whatever other platforms it was ported onto
[01:50:20] <Brekkjern> Would anything of value be lost though? I mean. The linux kernel would be much more safe if it was.

[02:04:19] <bsandro> true that, but that doesn't mean critique is not allowed either
[02:04:37] <companion_cube> Courteous criticism, indeed not
[02:04:51] <technomancy> what if people who actually cared about obscure architectures were the ones who did the work to making them supported instead of yelling at other people about them
[02:04:54] <technomancy> just a thought
[02:05:17] <bsandro> companion_cube: the mileage for that varies for everyone though
[02:06:00] <technomancy> if anything dropping support for obscure architectures would be good for the mental health of the maintainers so there's fewer people to yell at them about things that don't matter
[02:07:01] <albertito> I think most of you are assuming things about how these non-mainstream architectures are maintained, that are inaccurate to various degrees

[02:10:19] <albertito> Brekkjern: have you had a lot of actual hassle? you know you can just say "sorry, that platform is unsupported" and that'd be the end of it in most cases. This isn't anything new, this has been happening since forever
[02:10:31] <msmith12[m]> Technology moves on, its like asking someone whos making a tv addon to support analog tv
[02:10:31] <technomancy> companion_cube: there is a guy who has been contributing to Emacs for years who would yell at anyone who contributed a file with more than 8.3 char filename because he reeeeally wanted Emacs to continue to build on MS-DOS

[02:11:24] <technomancy> wish I was joking
[02:11:34] <bsandro> I didn't talk about supporting obscure thing "natively", it was about _breaking_ support via something that is not related to python per se
[02:11:58] <Brekkjern> Which support?
[02:12:06] <Brekkjern> "Shit runs" != "supported"
[02:12:58] <bsandro> in any case, i don't like hardwired native libs building in scripting languages packages
[02:13:30] <companion_cube> If python wasn't so slow it had to be built around C extensions...

[02:32:38] <bsandro> companion_cube: "doesn't support yet" for starters
[02:32:58] <bsandro> i'm not a fan of his either but don't just bash stuff because you dislike a persona
[02:33:25] <riv> why not?
[02:33:35] <kline> because its anti-foss
[02:33:38] <bsandro> stuff I make for fun doesn't support windows too, for example, because I don't have it anywhere
[02:33:45] <kline> also, frankly, just plain anti-productive
[02:33:48] <kline> tools is tools is tools
[02:34:06] <msmith12[m]> FYI albertito's quote refers to https://digitpatrox.com/10000-attended-walk-in-vaccine-centres-yesterday/ . I had a feeling it was vaccine related when it involved "under age of 19"
[02:34:24] <companion_cube> bsandro: doesn't he state he doesnt plan to support them?
[02:34:45] <albertito> it's from https://www.rte.ie/news/coronavirus/2021/0801/1238492-coronavirus-ireland/, and yeah, it refers to the 10k people attending walk-in vaccination yesterday (the first day of such a thing here in Ireland)
[02:35:31] <ngoldbaum> how is it like an authoritarian dictatorship to not support s390x and musl?
[02:35:44] * ngoldbaum takes it to ##crustaceans
[02:35:49] <bsandro> companion_cube: oh, it actually is, amusing :D
[02:36:00] <companion_cube> Apparently they're more importanr than windows
[02:36:09] <bsandro> i'll ask for templeos support I guess
[02:36:40] <companion_cube> kline: it did
[02:36:52] <kline> hold on
[02:36:59] <kline> i saw a fedi post about this earlier
[02:37:00] <bsandro> ngoldbaum: it is not, I did not imply that.
[02:37:13] <companion_cube> Because hare is... So ddevault
[02:37:42] <riv> what if someone who runs a project is really abusive and toxic
[02:37:46] <kline> oh, is the name public now?
[02:37:48] <ngoldbaum> is templeos free software?
[02:38:07] <kline> riv, i dont think that actually prohibits you from _using_ the project, even if you dont want to support or be involved in it
[02:38:13] <Brekkjern> If templeos is anything like any other major religion, then it's probably not free
[02:38:30] <companion_cube> You can contribute but only if you hear god
[02:38:39] <riv> templeos is not copyleft its public domain
[02:38:45] * ngoldbaum drops acid, opens emacs
[02:38:49] <ngoldbaum> otoh holyc gross
[02:38:59] <ngoldbaum> let‚Äôs do holyrust
[02:39:03] <Brekkjern> It's a great name for a language though
[02:39:06] <technomancy> most problems can be solved by swallowing a tiny fleck of gelatin containing a medium dose of LSD, and spending most of the night sitting on a concrete park bench outside your home, gazing up at a hundred billion galaxies each with a hundred billion stars, and each star a giant thermonuclear fusion reaction as powerful as our Sun, and for the first time in your life knowing deep down inside that we are not alone.
[02:39:20] <technomancy> ^ hypercard style
[02:39:30] <companion_cube> That's, like, wow
[02:39:58] <companion_cube> Submit your lsd punchcard along with your first PR
[02:39:59] <kline> ok
[02:40:17] <kline> because the fedi instance im on is bizarrely performative, im struggling to find this post about using software
[02:40:25] <riv> the community around a piece of software matters though
[02:40:26] <technomancy> companion_cube: taken from https://www.mondo2000.com/2018/06/18/the-inspiration-for-hypercard/
[02:40:32] <kline> however, i have found a large quantity of posts about chris chan
[02:40:54] <albertito> hey, leave the templeos alone; it's just a guy doing it with his heart (and a lot of technical competency), not some vatican conspiracy to get people into organized religion evilness
[02:41:01] <riv> albertito, he is dead
[02:41:07] <albertito> riv: no, really!?!?!?!?
[02:41:12] <riv> yes hit by a train
[02:41:13] <kline> albertito, hit by a trian
[02:41:21] <kline> (supposedly)
[02:41:25] <kline> (glowies finally got him)
[02:42:10] <bsandro> 11th aug is anniversary btw
[02:42:14] <companion_cube> Maybe the opus dei will switch to templeOS, thus making it mainstream
[02:42:45] <kline> im pretty sure terry rejected organised christianity as a scam
[02:42:46] <riv> you dont celebrate the anniversary of someone dying
[02:42:56] <msmith12[m]> Who is chris chan? Is he some olympic swimmer? I heard about him on the news
[02:43:05] <msmith12[m]> riv: rather, you can say "if he was a live he would be x years old"
[02:43:10] <bsandro> riv: who said about celebrating?
[02:43:10] <msmith12[m]> on his birthday
[02:43:23] <bsandro> "commemorating" is the word I think?

[02:45:15] <msmith12[m]> lol thats what happened
[02:45:24] <imode> didn't know he had it in him.
[02:45:29] <msmith12[m]> ell i hope he gets the help he needs
[02:45:30] <msmith12[m]> Well
[02:45:31] <imode> wait wasn't she like, disabled and had dimentia.
[02:45:54] <msmith12[m]> Looking into it now, theres two sites decidated to him and a 30 hour documentary
[02:45:56] <msmith12[m]> "The most documented man in history"
[02:46:16] <imode> otherwise known as "let's beat a mentally ill person with the internet stick to milk them for fun"
[02:46:32] <msmith12[m]> I think. I hear Winston Churchill's biography is the longest ever made but i have not seen it, so I think he might just be the documented man in history
[02:46:49] <imode> same kind of "fame" that surrounded terry davis.
[02:46:56] <msmith12[m]> I think talk is fine, but harrasment and crossing into his personal life is not fine
[02:47:34] <msmith12[m]> If you are going on the internet then people have right to talk about you, but they do not necessarily have the right to harras you and make life harder
[02:47:48] <imode> if you ever find yourself caught up in that, just remember that your psyche and physiology is fragile, and you could be on the verge of a break but not know it for 5-10 years.
[02:48:01] <msmith12[m]> (Note: that does not imply that people should just say bad stuff because they want to)
[02:50:16] <msmith12[m]> Fred from Fontforge was actually talkinga bout this
[02:51:08] <imode> terry davis was a normal ass engineer at one point in his life, and then everything just fell apart.
[02:51:28] <msmith12[m]> Terry is one of the best programmers to ever live. He coded that entire os by himself
[02:51:34] <msmith12[m]> Regardless of his mental state
[02:52:05] <imode> I don't want to downplay that but people have written similar operating systems.
[02:52:11] <imode> solo, if you'll believe it.
[02:53:06] <bsandro> no one said he is the only one who managed to do that tho
[02:53:08] <imode> to me the achievement was that he did it while his faculties weren't there. he kept up development despite his impairments and life situations.
[02:53:40] <companion_cube> msmith12[m]: I find Andreas Kling more interesting though, for real
[02:53:47] <bsandro> but making an os and a compiler and basically everything from ground up is super impressive imo
[02:53:52] <imode> it is.
[02:53:56] <companion_cube> Maybe not as impressive, but he's writing an actually nice OS

[02:55:46] <ngoldbaum> holy shit chris chan did *what*
[02:55:53] <bsandro> lots of modern projects that are not mainstream and made purely for fun are amazing
[02:56:00] <imode> twitter had that hashtag for a while ngoldbaum.
[02:56:12] <imode> literally "CHRIS CHAN DID WHAT"
[02:56:25] <imode> bsandro: tell me about it. that's some artisenal programming.
[02:56:39] <bsandro> serenityos is a good example yep; another one that pops up in my mind (as a gamedev) is a "retro city rampage"
[02:57:21] <imode> Planet X1, X2 and X3 from David Murray are really interesting, along with his latest game.
[02:57:23] <companion_cube> Although ofc Serenity OS relies on an existing C++ compiler
[02:57:31] <companion_cube> Which you really can't do on your own
[02:57:34] <iDrougge> I don't see what makes SerenityOS good or interesting. It seems to combine two retro ideas into an unholy alliance, like so many other projects from OSNews 20 years ago.
[02:58:07] <bsandro> iDrougge: i like the overall attitude there, is is a pure fun-driven programming
[02:58:39] <companion_cube> Also the win98 look is pretty nice, imho
[02:58:43] <companion_cube> Very readable
[02:58:54] <imode> "Zero to HTML" in a year solo is uh.
[02:58:57] <imode> fucking unbelievable.
[02:59:15] <imode> I don't want to (and couldn't) do that.
[02:59:23] <iDrougge> Most Windows UI decisions are backwards just to be different from Apple.
[02:59:26] <companion_cube> Graphic toolkit included, yeah..
[02:59:34] <imode> well I mean I probably could. I wouldn't have any kind of motivation to.
[02:59:40] <imode> the win98 look is peak usability IMO.
[03:00:06] <companion_cube> iDrougge: the old Mac OS with only one mouse button? Riiight
[03:00:12] <iDrougge> But that's what makes me unimpressed, there seem to be zero first principles in Serenity.
[03:00:23] <imode> that's true.
[03:00:29] <iDrougge> companion_cube: Yes, OSX was obviously not invented yet.
[03:00:52] <companion_cube> Well, one mouse button cripples the thing in my book
[03:01:16] <imode> companion_cube: tell me about it. I recently bought a Clevo. I can't play barotrauma because I can't hold my right mouse button and shoot!
[03:01:35] <iDrougge> companion_cube: Which is funny considering how minor a role the second or third buttons play on Windows.
[03:01:45] <legoktm[m]> <Church> "legoktm: And nifty, what's it..." <- It's really nice working at a place that's ethically in the right direction, privacy focused, mostly self-hosted, etc. We operate at a different scale than other comparable sites, but it's always pretty fun/exciting. Also just about everything we do is public so I can talk about it as much as I want
[03:01:52] <companion_cube> Right click is secondary? Lol
[03:02:02] <imode> right click aims!
[03:02:10] <imode> you hold right click, and press left click to use the thing you're aiming.
[03:02:22] <iDrougge> imode: Placing a dangerous button (close) right next to two harmless ones (minimise/maximise) is hardly "peak usability".
[03:02:35] <imode> iDrougge: ...?
[03:02:56] <bsandro> it feels like apple relationships with mouse fell apart somewhere around Lisa
[03:03:03] <imode> not sure who or what you're responding to there.
[03:03:12] <bsandro> i can't justify the magic mouse charging method in any other way
[03:03:15] <iDrougge> imode: Look at the screenshot here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SerenityOS/serenity/master/Meta/screenshot-0f85753.png
[03:03:25] <companion_cube> Aren't they also close on Mac OS X?
[03:03:25] <iDrougge> <imode> the win98 look is peak usability IMO.
[03:03:28] <imode> oh.
[03:03:32] <companion_cube> Just on the opposite side?
[03:03:32] <imode> no the buttons suck ass.
[03:03:40] <imode> but the rest of the UI is bangin'.
[03:04:17] <imode> I like the hard pixelized look.
[03:04:26] <iDrougge> companion_cube: Yes, it's a bad decision there too.
[03:04:27] <imode> everything just feels visible.
[03:04:42] <companion_cube> Maybe it's peak usability of what has actually existed
[03:04:55] <companion_cube> Not the theoretical best
[03:05:00] <companion_cube> That's hard to defend :)
[03:05:29] <iDrougge> Or peak usability of what Kling has used, which amounts two different editions of Windows.
[03:06:01] <iDrougge> Putting menus inside windows is also far from peak usability.
[03:06:33] <msmith12[m]> Kling (Both of them) are also very good
[03:06:38] <msmith12[m]> I find that the best programmers out there are ones you don
[03:06:39] <msmith12[m]> 't even know abot
[03:06:42] <imode> https://i.imgur.com/eaNTxF3.png rate my usability
[03:07:11] <iDrougge> That's even more retro.
[03:07:17] <companion_cube> The best programmer I know works at MSR... In C++...
[03:07:24] <imode> rip
[03:07:45] <msmith12[m]> Technically, anyone can only say "the best programmer they
[03:07:55] <ngoldbaum> std::rip::ded
[03:08:05] <msmith12[m]> they've worked with", since there will always be prgrammers who you dont know that could be better
[03:08:05] <bsandro> imode: how big is your display?
[03:08:08] <imode> iDrougge: it is possibly the only color scheme/layout that isn't distracting.
[03:08:11] <imode> bsandro: 14".
[03:08:14] <msmith12[m]> No one knows the "Best programmer of all time"
[03:08:19] <ngoldbaum> std::daddy::thicc
[03:08:24] <msmith12[m]> Its like "the best hackers have not been caught"
[03:08:36] <imode> msmith12[m]: von neumann, mel, knuth.
[03:08:42] <imode> backus, maybe.
[03:08:58] <technomancy> chuck moore, fabrice bellard
[03:09:09] <msmith12[m]> Some of the best, but there could be someone who is even better that prefered to be anonymous or not make themselves known
[03:09:16] <imode> those two are god-tier.
[03:09:18] <msmith12[m]> For example: kosyta, ross
[03:09:19] <imode> I want a baseball card of both.
[03:09:28] <technomancy> anyway "programming" is a lot of different things and you can't be good at all of them
[03:09:37] <bsandro> imode: i like it :D dwm?
[03:09:42] <imode> bsandro: i3.
[03:09:44] <imode> near-default config.
[03:09:46] <msmith12[m]> Lattner is best programmer
[03:09:52] <technomancy> saying someone is "the best programmer" is like saying something is "the best programming language"; it's meaningless outside context
[03:10:04] <msmith12[m]> True
[03:10:04] <companion_cube> Yeah, I quantified with "best that I know"
[03:10:08] <imode> lol.
[03:10:19] <bsandro> imode: was it hard to ditch syntax highlight?
[03:10:23] <companion_cube> Also a computer scientist, I should say
[03:10:25] <imode> bsandro: still have it.
[03:10:32] <imode> but no, not hard.
[03:10:50] <msmith12[m]> The best that I know is lattner, kosya, knuth, beh
[03:11:02] <msmith12[m]> I think Bellard is nice because of nncp and the pi thing
[03:11:20] <msmith12[m]> I think those show his skill the most
[03:11:23] <msmith12[m]> Not ffmpeg as most people know him for
[03:11:24] <imode> bsandro: you won't believe this but I edit large software projects at Amazon with just nano.
[03:11:51] <bsandro> imode: i believe you because i edit large games codebase with nothing but nano :D
[03:12:16] <bsandro> I even hacked fzf into file open dialogue at some point, it is super wonky though
[03:12:23] <imode> hahahaha.
[03:12:27] <msmith12[m]> Current ffmpeg is very very very different from when bellard created it any many features (filter, current ffmpeg cli interface, etc.) where invented from others. I miss when Bellard was involved with ffmpeg however, it was "better" back then in terms of quality
[03:12:54] <bsandro> at some point my brain started to rot from all the "new good things" in xcode
[03:13:02] <bsandro> like when they introduced tabs inside of tabs recently
[03:13:58] <imode> can you do tabs inside of tabs inside of tabs?
[03:14:00] <companion_cube> Don't forget qemu
[03:14:06] <bsandro> and qtcreator and other stuff is just extremely confusing to me because of gui
[03:14:13] <technomancy> companion_cube: yeah I mostly know him from jslinux, qemu, and his C compiler
[03:14:19] <technomancy> I didn't even remember he was involved with ffmpeg
[03:14:21] <bsandro> imode: don't give them ideas please
[03:14:22] <msmith12[m]> Oh qemu,  another nice tool
[03:14:27] <msmith12[m]> He said that "Qemu" was his most important project
[03:14:33] <msmith12[m]> in some old interview
[03:14:59] <imode> I mean, it arguably is.
[03:15:11] <iDrougge> bsandro: I don't understand how those tabs are supposed to work. I think they must be broken.
[03:15:11] <msmith12[m]> I know that his influence in qemu is bigger than in ffmpeg.
[03:15:35] <msmith12[m]> As in he did more in qemu relative to others compared to ffmpeg.
[03:15:38] <imode> bsandro: that violates the 0, 1, infinity rule.
[03:15:45] <bsandro> iDrougge: i managed to turn them off but one wrong movement and they appear again ;_;
[03:15:56] <iDrougge> I turned them off too, to no avail.
[03:16:39] <imode> intelliJ really isn't that bad.
[03:17:07] <msmith12[m]> Someone told me it was his birthday recently. I use clion as its cross platform and can debug projects with makefiles
[03:17:15] <msmith12[m]> Other than clion i use visual studio or xcode depending on what os im on
[03:17:16] <bsandro> some folks here use clion for ios/android projects
[03:17:32] <iDrougge> Not Appcode?
[03:17:36] <bsandro> but 95% of our codebase is c++ that's why it is manageable probably
[03:18:09] <bsandro> oh, I might be confusing them, iDrougge, you're right
[03:19:08] <iDrougge> All IntelliJ IDEs look the same.
[03:19:35] <iDrougge> If it's C++, it may very well be CLion.

[03:20:13] <bsandro> their tools are nice but marketing is just obnoxious imo
[03:20:24] <msmith12[m]> IRC and chat in general is just the best. I don't know why more people don't embrace it. You get to see a bit of everything.

[03:23:54] <sklv1> ye it's flippant and dismissive, and he should have stated some concrete reasons as to why, but it's not like a slight on his character in my opinion

[03:25:31] <companion_cube> sklv1: I've been personally insulted by ddevault so I don't regard him as nice :p
[03:27:12] <sklv1> companion_cube: he's definitely not nice, but i respect his contributions, and voicing his opinions even if i don't agree with all of them
[03:27:48] <sklv1> he wants to see a less centralised, less needlessly complex and more open world in terms of technology, and that's something i'd like to see too
[03:28:19] <companion_cube> That's the positive view of what he wants, yes
[03:28:38] <companion_cube> "less needlessly complex" is sadly very subjective
[03:28:46] <sklv1> would you regard Linus as nice? I wouldn't and it's much the same. I sure don't agree that "security bugs are just bugs" but I still think his contributions are very positive
[03:29:22] <bsandro> or Theo
[03:29:36] <companion_cube> Linus has become better I think
[03:29:42] <sklv1> well to put it in practical terms, bloat in software has reduced performance much faster than hardware has made it faster
[03:29:56] <companion_cube> But then I don't think ddevault is nearly as good as Linus

[03:31:53] <sklv1> as a proponent of rust, i agree with his take that "go programmers solve problems by writing go, rust programmers solve problems by adding language features"
[03:32:12] <iDrougge> Using email for everything is decidedly less complex for everyone who doesn't have to actually use it.
[03:32:31] <sklv1> iDrougge: what's the alternative though?
[03:32:48] <iDrougge> Github, or preferably replacing Git itself.
[03:33:04] <sklv1> better email than github, azure devops, or whatever the atlassian solution is
[03:33:29] <iDrougge> Azure Devops shouldn't be put in the same basket as Github.

[03:34:36] <iDrougge> What does that mean?
[03:34:57] <sklv1> i'm fundamentally not willing to consider a solution for developing software at scale that's not open source
[03:35:12] <iDrougge> Unfortunately, open source has, thus far, failed us.
[03:35:15] <msmith12[m]> Open source  is the future
[03:35:16] <msmith12[m]> More so now then back then
[03:35:23] <companion_cube> sklv1: I agree too, but that's because rust programmers have higher standards :p
[03:35:26] <iDrougge> But I believe Gitlab is open source.
[03:35:38] <sklv1> iDrougge: linux kernel seems to be doing fine
[03:35:48] <technomancy> gitlab is open source but it's barely usable sludgeware
[03:35:58] <sklv1> Gitlab is... comparable to email, a respectable solution
[03:36:03] <companion_cube> (I'm mostly trolling there, but Go favors uniformly meh code because the language can't handle better)
[03:36:32] <technomancy> at least in my email client if I type fast I can see the words show up and I don't have to type slower so their useless script can keep up
[03:36:38] <iDrougge> sklv1: I don't think you can handle pull requests using the Linux kernel.
[03:36:45] *** Joins: qdef (~quassel@user/edef)
[03:37:03] <sklv1> so far higher standards have resulted in 3 competing async runtime implementations because spawning threads on windows is expensive, and doing a basic async task used to pull in a nightmarish train of dependencies
[03:37:15] <sklv1> iDrougge: linux kernel developers handle pull requests just fine is what I meant
[03:37:22] <sklv1> without using Github
[03:38:18] <iDrougge> Ah, but that's either because they like hair shirts (why would they otherwise clone some crazy old 70s minicomputer system?) or because it fits _their_ organisation, with Linus and his vassals.
[03:38:44] <sklv1> regardless, they are proof that it is possible and viable
[03:38:45] <iDrougge> That's why Github exists, really.
[03:39:27] <iDrougge> It is viable to use a web browser without Javascript too, if you're Richard Stallman.
[03:39:29] <bsandro> g'night lads, nice chatting w/ you
[03:39:54] <sklv1> i use tor browser without javascript lots of the time, and it works just fine for a large number of things
[03:40:06] <iDrougge> I also think Drew Devault takes a lot of accidental complexity for granted.
[03:40:57] <iDrougge> The BSD kernels are even developed using CVS, I think. It might work for them.

[03:42:46] <companion_cube> sklv1: yeah async seems messy. But Tokio is winning I think.
[03:42:54] <companion_cube> In a few years it'll have settled down
[03:43:50] <sklv1> and then what? "to use async in rust, just use this 3rd party library which pulls in 100 dependencies"? that's not a good solution
[03:44:10] <sklv1> it's already crazy that you have to pull in this crate with 10 dependencies to *simply generate a random number*
[03:48:30] <ngoldbaum> does hare have a builtin rng?
[03:49:05] <companion_cube> sklv1: maybe, but good rng are hard? And the libraries are split in small chunks, which is not bad in itself
[03:50:04] <sklv1> yea untill you run cargo geiger and see that most of them are unsafe, and i generally find it hard to believe there's not a way to accomplish it in the standard library
[03:50:25] <companion_cube> They didn't want to commit to a particular generator, I believe.
[03:50:38] <companion_cube> The unsafe part is weird though.
[03:51:36] <companion_cube> In some sense there's already too much in the stdlib, look at mpsc being essentially subsumed by parking lot or rayon (forgot which one)
[03:51:49] <enterprisey> I suppose the idea is that random libraries are sorta complex and they don't really have to be in std
[03:51:57] <sklv1> and then you pull a typical crate, and see that 3 versions of the RNG crate are in use, because it's a hassle to keep updating them

[03:56:32] <iDrougge> Even if you don't have an RNG, you can have an interface for an RNG and standard functions to call that RNG.
[03:56:42] <companion_cube> The question is more why rng isn't 1.0 (iirc)
[03:57:06] <iDrougge> And it's not as though you need to _commit_ to a specific RNG, then.
[03:57:12] <companion_cube> Agreed, there could be a standard trait
[03:57:29] <sklv1> there are multiple IIRC
[03:57:31] <companion_cube> Although nothing in it is required for language support, unlike Future
[03:58:36] <iDrougge> Changing the default RNG shouldn't be a breaking change, either. It's supposed to give you a random number, there's no need to guarantee that it is generated in any specific way.
[03:59:20] <companion_cube> That's the case for the hash function
[03:59:25] <companion_cube> (SipHash)
[03:59:44] <companion_cube> But I suppose they never considered random generators are being necessary in the stdlib... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
[04:00:11] <iDrougge> So the hashing isn't using a randomised seed?
[04:01:52] <ngoldbaum> i think they‚Äôre insertion ordered so that doesn‚Äôt matter
[04:02:10] <ngoldbaum> unless you‚Äôre talking about timing attacks or something?

[04:04:18] <companion_cube> But good question, idk how it initializes
[04:06:06] <iDrougge> I wonder if Rust's stdlib doesn't already have a private RNG somewhere, just as Go needs a private generics system to avoid stupid amounts of code duplication.
[04:06:53] <companion_cube> Or the std runtime, maybe
[04:07:09] <companion_cube> Or it reads from urandom üòÇ
[04:07:15] <companion_cube> But I really don't know
[04:07:59] <sklv1> companion_cube: thankfully, there is no std runtime, one of the key innovations of the language
[04:08:43] <sklv1> i doubt there is a private RNG either or they'd expose it

[08:15:08] <msmith12[m]> At least with Marcan i know him from ashai linux
[08:15:43] <Irenes> foone is a non-binary being who collects weird hardware

[08:36:59] <Irenes> I hear good things about Mastodon
[08:37:56] <vaillancourtmax> Never used Gab (and don't intend to), so can't really compare with Twitter or Mastodon. However, I much prefer the vibe on Mastodon compared to Twitter.
[08:38:13] <msmith12[m]> Mastodon is better than twitter i think
[08:38:14] <msmith12[m]> Mastodon is also better than gab
[08:38:26] <msmith12[m]> But its only fairly recently i think that Mastodon is where it was before
[08:38:32] <pnoud> Ok so this thread actually does work well in the Twitter format.  I was expecting one of those epic multi-part posts where it's just more words than fits on Twitter, but this is just regular updates to the same project, roughly as they happen.
[08:38:33] <msmith12[m]> A couple years ago I dont think people took Mastodon seriously
[08:38:54] <vaillancourtmax> A lot of it likely has to do with the people I follow, but still, the Mastodon software itself feels "saner" than Twitter, which feels like constant and intentional chaos
[08:39:13] <Irenes> yeah... I think the chaos is in fact intentional
[08:39:13] <pnoud> Mastodon isn't a network though right?  It's just software and you host your own instance?
[08:39:22] <Irenes> it's clear how it boosts the company's bottom line
[08:39:23] <technomancy> pnoud: correct
[08:39:33] <msmith12[m]> I always wonder what goes into people's follow choices. I just follow everyone who follows me back + some people i like
[08:39:35] <pnoud> But you can "share" posts across networks?
[08:39:51] <Irenes> eh, I collect people who seem interesting
[08:39:56] <msmith12[m]> On twitter i hear Elon accidentaly followed someone and then unfollowed after
[08:40:43] <vaillancourtmax> pnoud: Mastodon itself isn't a network, but it allows to connect to other instances on what is known as the "fediverse" (federated universe: constellation of decentralized instances)
[08:41:05] <klardotsh> pnoud: it runs on ActivityPub if you're familiar. each instance has N users (where N>=1) who can see the other users' toots on that instance ("local" timeline) and toots on (most...) other instances ("federated" timeline)
[08:41:35] <vaillancourtmax> Thanks for the excellent explanation klardotsh!
[08:41:38] <klardotsh> users can follow users on any* other instance to curate their personal timeline (the default view, like twitter)
[08:42:18] <pnoud> Yeah I am familiar with it at a high level.  It's interesting for sure.  One thing I don't understand is why an instance would have more than one user, or a handful of personas that are owned by one person.
[08:42:44] <msmith12[m]> reminds me of usenet
[08:42:46] <Irenes> I actually think in the ideal world it wouldn't
[08:42:56] <vaillancourtmax> Mainly, different instances have topics/themes/cultures/rules
[08:43:06] <Irenes> but it is resource-intensive so full peer-peer isn't straightforward from a technical perspective
[08:43:22] <klardotsh> communities of likeminded people sometimes (fosstodon or merveilles.town) or just a way of getting a bunch of users *somewhere* (mastodon.social) to avoid the "how do I pick a provider" problem
[08:43:26] <Irenes> especially since the server-server parts are designed to need something always-on, which is not easy for nontechnical users
[08:43:47] <technomancy> pnoud: mastodon instances have a lot of users because they're a huge PITA to install so it's not worth it for one user
[08:43:57] <pnoud> I can understand having a bunch of instances on one box with a common admin but something like mastodon makes me want to map my "identity" in the fediverse to something like a domain name.
[08:44:27] <pnoud> Can I move my "account" or "identity" or whatever Mastodon/Fediverse call it between instances?
[08:44:27] <technomancy> pnoud: other fedi servers like pleroma or epicyon are often single-user

[08:44:49] <technomancy> pnoud: yeah migration allows you to move to a new server on a different domain
[08:45:02] <pnoud> Ah ok that alleviates some of my concerns then.
[08:45:51] <pnoud> So Mastodon is multi-user _because_ administration is a pain and it allows more people to participate?
[08:45:57] <technomancy> yeah
[08:46:37] <pnoud> I was thinking of setting up a mastodon server to keep in touch with friends and family but then I realized I don't actually care what most of them thing.
[08:46:40] <pnoud> think*
[08:47:01] <klardotsh> I think it was designed multi-user because that's how ActivityPub (which also powers, what, GNU Social, Pleroma, and a few others? Pixelfed or something too) views the world. "Mini Twitter" or "Mini Instagram" models that can talk to each other.
[08:47:47] <pnoud> klardotsh: except in this case mini instagram can talk to mini twitter.  Or maybe more accurately pnoud-twitter can talk to klardotsh-twitter
[08:47:58] <klardotsh> both are correct!
[08:48:08] <pnoud> Right yeah tha's cool.
[08:48:09] <vaillancourtmax> pnoud: I'm having trouble just getting friends and family to move over to Signal (from Facebook Messenger), can't imagine it would be easy to move friends & family from Facebook to Mastodon, and even less so with acquaintances on Twitter
[08:48:20] <pnoud> So it is like a hybrid of "social media" and usenet.
[08:48:49] <vaillancourtmax> I love the idea of having friends and family on a small self-hosted server though, but definitely feels more idealistic than anything
[08:48:51] <Irenes> I should say that it's not *easy* to move your account across instances
[08:48:57] <klardotsh> Eh, maybe "social media" and... email? Doesn't have the immutability of usenet (IIRC that was a thing for usenet?...)
[08:49:15] <technomancy> https://runyourown.social/ <- hometown is a masto fork that's optimized for existing private communities
[08:49:15] <Irenes> which instance you start on does have far-reaching implications, which is unfortunate because new users are the least positioned to make that choice
[08:49:54] <pnoud> vaillancourtmax: I had a friend ask about mastodon!  And my whole family is on iThings and use iMessage and iCloud to stay in touch and share photos.  So if there's a good photo sharing and messageing app for the Fediverse I think it would be "easy"
[08:50:26] <vaillancourtmax> pnoud: I heard good things about Pixelfed!
[08:50:31] <pnoud> I was thinking about "friends and family" but I think it makes more sense to organize instances as "interests"
[08:50:32] <vaillancourtmax> technomancy, thanks for sharing!
[08:50:53] <vaillancourtmax> Pixelfed is more like Instagram though
[08:51:11] <pnoud> Can I have a common identify across the fediverse?
[08:51:39] <Irenes> you can be active on instances other than the one your account is on, if that's the question
[08:51:45] <pnoud> Say I post photos on pixelfed but then spew my views on economics on mastodon
[08:52:06] <Irenes> ah that's an excellent question
[08:52:14] <pnoud> But can anyone who has heard of "pnoud" find me in both "places?"

[08:53:04] <pnoud> My understanding of the fediverse/activitypub is that it is basically just a feed and Mastodon and PixelFed and whatever else are more like clients or "apps"
[08:54:37] *** Quits: digi (digi@tilde.team) (Remote host closed the connection)
[08:54:48] <pnoud> But I don't understand the fediverse's concept of an identity
[08:56:20] <vaillancourtmax> Well, there's no centralized identity across intances. You can create different accounts on different instances, and they won't be linked whatsoever
[08:57:35] <pnoud> I see.  if I post something on PixelFed is it possible that someone could see it on a Mastodon instance?
[08:58:44] <vaillancourtmax> Given that they're both running on top of ActivityPub, I'd assume yes, but don't quote me on that
[08:58:47] *** Joins: avane (~avane@user/avane)
[08:58:57] <technomancy> yeah, you can do that
[08:59:09] <technomancy> you can make your masto account just boost everything posted by a pixelfed account
[08:59:16] <pnoud> technomancy: thanks.  But I assume that is limited to what each "app" supports?
[08:59:33] <pnoud> "Boost" = repost?
[08:59:38] <technomancy> boost is repost, yeah
[08:59:47] <technomancy> it depends more on the client you're viewing in than on the server
[08:59:50] <sam_> boost is a prominent C++ library
[09:00:10] <fedorafan> morning
[09:00:14] <pnoud> Right but that's still two posts at that point
[09:00:55] <cb> as a longish fedi user (since 2017) i have doubts on its sustainability
[09:01:13] <pnoud> Like maybe PixelFed has a "comment" feature on an image but if someone comments on my PixelFed post I won't see those comments on Mastodon?
[09:01:31] <pnoud> More importantly someone following me on Mastodon won't see the comments from PixelFed
[09:01:33] <technomancy> pnoud: they should see it
[09:01:39] <pnoud> Ah interesting.
[09:02:04] *** Joins: hedy (hedy@tilde.team)
[09:02:07] <vaillancourtmax> cb: care to explain? I feel like with the self-sustaining user base, that wouldn't be an issue, but curious to read your thoughts on this
[09:02:11] <pnoud> Ok so the concept of the post and what the application does with that post are separate?  So the same "post" can be rendered differently in Mastodon _and_ PixelFed (for example)

[09:03:32] <cb> little bit drama, little bit the tendency to cluster onto big nodes (and the difficulties of i.e. moderating those), little bit the network is entirely unprepapred for i.e. spam, etc.
[09:03:35] <technomancy> pnoud: basically every server and every client will show you text posts, images, and videos.
[09:04:01] <cb> a lot of software kinda munges shit so mastodon will handle it better
[09:04:01] <technomancy> I don't think I've ever seen spam on my account. maybe once? since 2017
[09:04:11] <cb> there's a lot of diff activity types but mastodon only sees a few
[09:04:13] <technomancy> certainly a lot *less* spam than twitter
[09:04:21] <cb> technomancy: early usenet and email was like that
[09:04:38] <cb> then spam happened

[09:05:25] <technomancy> luckily we've learned a lot since the 1980s
[09:05:56] <pnoud> I'm not as worried about spam as I am about figuring out where to be active.  Like should I install all of these things and somehow link my accounts?  Or can I use PixelFed to post pictures from my camping trip and then make a mastodon post about a new recipe and have my mom see both of them on her Friendica feed?
[09:06:15] <cb> the problem is i dont see any lessons from that applied to fediverse
[09:06:19] <cb> it's still a trusting network
[09:06:39] <cb> a lot of people have sep accounts for partitioning both their perspective and their aspects
[09:06:46] <cb> what they wanna see vs. what they wanna send
[09:06:53] <cb> i.e. a public thing and a comfy thing
[09:06:57] <cb> sometimes a horny thing
[09:07:09] <pnoud> Right but what about consolidation?
[09:07:39] <technomancy> pnoud: you could have a mastodon account that is set up to boost everything posted to your pixelfed account
[09:08:05] <pnoud> I guess I don't quite "get" the fediverse.  I thought it was one unified thing but maybe it makes more sense to think of Mastodon and PixelFed as "galaxies"?
[09:08:08] <technomancy> or you could just post your photos on mastodon? I'm honestly not sure what pixelfed offers over other servers since they all support images.
[09:08:18] *** Quits: vicfred (~vicfred@user/vicfred) (Quit: Leaving)
[09:08:19] <cb> it's a matter of frontend
[09:08:23] <technomancy> maybe it's about organizing older contents and not having the feed be the only way of viewing?
[09:08:27] <cb> as well as perhaps the backend can be task-optimized
[09:08:32] <pnoud> technomancy: well that's kinda my point though, like what if I have some friends on PixelFed and some on Friendica and some on Mastodon?
[09:08:36] <cb> and support fancier activities
[09:08:42] <cb> you can just follow them from whatever you're using
[09:08:44] <technomancy> pnoud: oh sure; everyone can see all the photos
[09:08:49] <pnoud> I just want to post and have everyone see it, if they want.
[09:08:50] <vaillancourtmax> pnoud: you should be able to follow them from across instances
[09:09:02] <cb> i.e i can follow pixelfed users from my pleroma account)
[09:09:04] <pnoud> Across instances but what about acorss _apps_?
[09:09:06] <cb> they all speak the same protocol (with again, caveats)
[09:09:17] <cb> but everything speaks a common subset
[09:09:22] <pnoud> ok awesome, thanks cb, that's what I was asking.

[09:13:18] <enterprisey> I realized why I feel like I follow a lot of people in here on mastodon: for one of those "what's your fediverse account" lobsters threads, I went through and followed everyone
[09:13:38] <pnoud> So you feel that way because it is true
[09:13:40] <pnoud> <_<
[09:14:23] <pnoud> This is pretty cool.  I like that I can share across "apps" (not sure if that is the right term) so I am not "locked in" to Mastodon or Friendica or whatever.
[09:15:06] <vaillancourtmax> Unrelated but somewhat related: just want to mention I enjoy the energy and level of discussion in this channel. Left IRC for a while, and just came back today to discover that there's a channel for lobste.rs. Kudos everyone :)
[09:15:42] <technomancy> pnoud: different types of posts might have different levels of support across server implementations. for instance, mastodon implemented polls as a post type, and it took a while before other servers and other clients added it. (maybe like three or four months for the main ones)
[09:16:26] <technomancy> sometimes if there's a lack of compatibility something will get converted; for instance, audio-only files got treated as videos with a black screen for a while
[09:16:27] <imode> annnnnd chris chan has been arrested.
[09:16:42] <enterprisey> the lead mastodon dev has been doing quite silly things recently, capping off a long history of doing quite silly things, so I'm looking around for an exit at the moment
[09:16:58] <enterprisey> might see if rustodon is still kicking
[09:17:00] <pnoud> technomancy: sure but if a buddy of mine sets up a fediverse instance for his friends and family I can post my stuff on my own Mastodon isntance and he can follow that and see it but I don't have to read his uncle's racist rants and if I switch to PixelFed my buddy can follow that too.
[09:17:01] <cb> he's driven by money, ego, people going for bat for him, etc.
[09:17:16] <imode> wait what's going on with mastodon?
[09:17:24] <cb> gargron is BDFL of it
[09:17:32] <cb> edicts happen

[09:17:42] <enterprisey> vaillancourtmax yes, it's quite a pleasant surprise to find an active IRC channel (outside of big open-source projects & tech support) these days!
[09:17:49] <cb> i.e. they made an official iOS app they de-emphasizes local server timelines
[09:17:59] <cb> and told people who didnt like that to piss off
[09:18:00] <technomancy> pnoud: yeah. you can mute his whole server or just his account or block him from seeing your stuff.
[09:18:02] <enterprisey> ^
[09:18:05] <imode> kooooooooool.
[09:18:19] <cb> blocks dontt really work well bc it's basically honour system
[09:18:20] <technomancy> pnoud: a lot of the time if the server tolerates racist posting it's better to just block the whole server
[09:18:24] <imode> fork the shiiiiiiiit out of it.
[09:18:27] <cb> unless your acc is completely private
[09:18:37] <pnoud> technomancy: well, I could also just follow my buddy's Freindica account and see it on my own Mastodon instance
[09:18:40] <pnoud> I think?
[09:18:45] <pnoud> And I wouldn't even know his uncle exists
[09:18:50] <pnoud> Which seems ideal.
[09:18:51] <cb> i.e. if alice blocks bob, bob can just....view alice as an anon
[09:18:51] <technomancy> yeah
[09:18:55] <enterprisey> also new accounts used to follow the admin account by default, but that got turned off recently, which uber-pissed some admins off because they used that for announcements, curation, etc
[09:19:44] <imode> fork the protocol, clients and server software?
[09:19:47] <enterprisey> imode there have been a few mastodon forks; I don't really follow them too much

[09:20:02] <imode> it seems like activitypub is overly complex.
[09:20:09] <imode> for very little gain.
[09:20:22] <cb> iirc most driven out of spite burn out, only forks worth mentioning go in their own direction
[09:20:24] <enterprisey> It's pretty crappy
[09:20:49] <cb> only ones that matter are hometoen which emphasizes local users and glitchsoc which is feature maximalism
[09:21:05] <enterprisey> yeah. I'm mainly thinking of ForkTogether
[09:21:06] <enterprisey> or at least that was its name at one point
[09:21:12] <cb> that prob burnt out
[09:21:19] <cb> i just run pleroma with friends bc it's lighter weight and uses a tasteful runtime
[09:21:29] <cb> i.e it's not a bear to run
[09:21:35] <enterprisey> pleroma's cool
[09:21:52] <enterprisey> it has a bad rep in some corners because we can't have nice things
[09:22:24] <enterprisey> does pleroma do multi-column?
[09:22:33] <cb> you can just use the mastodon fe
[09:23:00] <technomancy> I added some features to pleroma
[09:23:11] <technomancy> it was actually really easy to do even with no prior elixir experience
[09:23:16] <enterprisey> pleroma has a better (imageboard-style) thread UI, which I'd prefer to use if I was gonna be running it anyway
[09:23:26] <cb> i like elixir but i havenyt used phoenix yet
[09:23:34] <enterprisey> Misskey seems nice apart from the language barrier

[10:10:01] <enterprisey> it's a funny feeling of emptiness when an online "event" ends
[10:11:53] <dsc_> what event?
[10:12:26] <enterprisey> this is nerdy, but the July 2021 Wikipedia "Articles for Creation" backlog drive
[10:13:15] <enterprisey> one way to make a new wikipedia article is submit it as a draft to a process called "Articles for Creation", and someone will review it and either "accept" it, promoting it to an article, or "decline" it, giving you a reason and perhaps a way to improve it further, so that it can be accepted
[10:13:39] <enterprisey> we started july with a backlog of over four thousand drafts, and we reviewed every last one of them - a considerable task, considering we get a couple hundred new ones a day!
[10:14:00] <dsc_> ah so it is a yearly sprint of some sorts?
[10:14:06] <enterprisey> I ran the technical side (leaderboards, logs of what reviews were done, a "re-review" system where you can quality-control other people's reviews)
[10:14:24] <kline> how many people were active on reviewing?
[10:14:26] <enterprisey> it's a little more sporadic than that... the last one was June 2014
[10:14:45] <dsc_> that's cool though
[10:15:49] <enterprisey> 94 people signed up and all but six made at least one review. Three did over a thousand reviews each
[10:16:04] <enterprisey> "wikipedia: pareto-principle levels you'd never believe"
[10:18:11] <dsc_> wikipedia is a black hole for my productivity, go to a wiki page from Google, click on a few stuff, before I know it I am 3 hours in reading about 14th century priests and nobles
[10:18:24] <enterprisey> various Wikipedia processes have sprints/drives/blitzes: there's one for copyediting articles, another for creating "Good Articles" (articles that have passed a strict quality check), etc etc
[10:19:07] <enterprisey> there's a competition called the WikiCup where people try to make as many articles and "Good Articles" as possible: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiCup
[10:19:18] <enterprisey> the top competitors put in a truly disgusting amount of work
[10:20:03] <enterprisey> here's an example of the log page for one participant: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiCup/History/2021/Submissions/The_Rambling_Man
[10:20:28] <enterprisey> the first entry is the work required to bring https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_FA_Cup_Final to the "Featured Article" level, even higher than Good Article
[10:22:21] <enterprisey> I go down a lot of wikipedia rabbit holes myself. every few years I re-read all the chernobyl-related articles, or the space shuttle articles, etc etc
[10:23:13] <dsc_> i tend to gravitate towards diving into history related articles
[10:23:21] <dsc_> in line with my interests
[10:24:02] <enterprisey> our military history articles are some of the best; the task force ("WikiProject") for military history is by many measures the best and most active one - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:MILHIST

[15:17:03] <gerikson> it's always good to be aware of biases
[15:17:08] <fedorafan> correct
[15:17:28] <gerikson> f.ex. a lot of articles relating to South Asian history are *not* as well monitored as other articles
[15:17:42] <gerikson> it's quite easy to see India/Pakistan biases there

[15:22:36] <gerikson> I've only skimmed it but it's clear it's way too prolix for "normal" Wikipedia
[15:28:52] <fedorafan> i have no idea of that country just know there was colonialism and then ghandi came and now puhhh many people many cultures

[15:51:25] <mgdm> I found CSS grid to be fairly good too (although I did quite a lot of copying/pasting from examples)
[15:51:48] <mgdm> grid + a nice typography template == something at least half way usable
[15:52:09] <chancee1> CSS grid is very cool. I like flex-box for it's flexibility/robustness. And feels a bit more in keeping with the spirit of html
[15:52:50] <epilys> they are great once you "get" them
[15:53:46] <epilys> flex is less intuitive than grid

[16:15:35] <ignaloidas> html email is a scourge on this world, wipe it off the world
[16:16:30] <rhn> encoding in email depends on what you declare in the MIME part

[16:16:59] <c355e3b> I would disagree on that point
[16:17:20] <ignaloidas> you can have base64 encoded html, but it's still html
[16:17:56] <c355e3b> Right but understanding that fact is a key point of being able to make sense of the message
[16:18:17] <c355e3b> `__attribute__((__packed__))` comes to mind as an excellent example of this problem

[22:15:12] <jasom> I will order the ploopy thumb when it's ready.
[22:15:45] <technomancy>  ooh that's cute
[22:15:50] <imode> ploopy thumb lmao.
[22:16:00] <technomancy> I prefer the billiard ball type trackball myself tho
[22:16:32] <imode> playing FPS games on a trackball is a unique experience.
[22:16:46] <companion_cube> a uniquely bad experience*
[22:17:02] <imode> ding ding ding ding ding.

[22:24:42] <jasom> imode: last time I played an FPS was Counterstrike in like 2002?
[22:25:15] <technomancy> doom is just fine with the keyboard =)
[22:25:26] <jasom> I could probably still find all of the bomb locations on de_dust though.
[22:25:54] <c355e3b> replace all capatchas with de_dust2
[22:25:56] <c355e3b> don't at me

[22:30:09] <epilys> bomb has been planted.
[22:30:49] <lep> "play more promode"
[22:31:48] <lkhrs> epilys: heard the audio in my head
[22:33:02] <jasom> hah, it actually was de_dust2 not de_dust.  Memory not as good as I thought.
[22:33:52] <shapr> de_dust is almost as good as 2fort
[22:35:08] <c355e3b> tc_hyrdo only
[22:37:25] <lep> wbomb1 of warsow fame is de_dust2 made for warsow bomb & defuse gametype
[22:37:49] <lep> (or wfbomb1 for you warfork hipsters out there)

[23:01:15] <Church> c355e3b: I'm @'ing you, I like it.
[23:01:25] <Church> I also wanna play some CS1.6 now.
[23:01:55] <Church> c355e3b: Moonshot idea, config management over CS1.6
[23:02:12] <Church> Wanna deploy a package? You better go disarm that bomb.
[23:02:41] <c355e3b> Run a Minecraft server as a k8s controller
[23:02:45] <vaillancourtmax> Disarming a bomb feels more like patching a security vulnerability
[23:02:55] <mgdm> I dunno, I‚Äôve seen deployments be more like bombs going off
[23:02:59] <vaillancourtmax> Ha, fair
[23:03:02] <mgdm> Deploying to prod == throwing a grenade over a wall
[23:03:26] <mgdm> While shouting to the devops team ‚Äúthat‚Äôs your problem now‚Äù
[23:03:45] <Church> c355e3b: I'm pitching this idea at work now.
[23:04:03] <Church> My productivity will shoot up at least.
[23:04:17] <c355e3b> It won‚Äôt save you from GCP
[23:04:22] <Church> c355e3b: Haven't you written a MC k8s controller yet?
[23:04:28] <Church> It won't... sigh
[23:04:43] <c355e3b> I‚Äôm avoiding k8s
[23:04:54] <c355e3b> I do enough at work to make me sick of it
[23:04:56] <Church> Heh lucky

[23:33:26] <ario> k8 is nice...when it works
[23:33:36] <ario> i've found debugging k8 problems is really tricky
[23:33:52] <ario> you need deep knowledge of the setup
[23:33:57] <ario> but maybe i'm a noob
