[14:56:37] <fnstudio> the way i've been doing this is by copying the entire function in my init.el, replacing the relevant char, and re-eval-ing the function
[14:56:51] <fnstudio> it works but it's pretty ugly, i guess

[14:57:43] <fnstudio> would it be better if i treated the original function as a long string, replaced the value there, and then finally eval-ed the string?

[14:58:21] <fnstudio> still looks very much like monkey patching, which means my code will be brittle should things get changed upstream

[15:00:04] <pkal> Might something like advice-patch help you?

[15:04:47] <fnstudio> maybe advice-add as well... i'm exploring a few options, but that definitely put me on an interesting track

[20:10:45] <JordiGH> The US used to come to Mexico to use our film industry to make their movies. Honey I Shrunk The Kids was all filmed in Mexican sets.
