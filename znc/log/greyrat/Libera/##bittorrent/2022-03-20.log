[02:39:46] <TT2121> Generally, what causes issues with downloading torrents? I have been sitting here for the past few minutes waiting for my torrent I want to download to load but it seems almost infinite.
[02:40:57] <TT2121> I checked the health of the torrent and it seems to have a number of both peers and seeders.

[22:17:19] <TheSHAD0W> He waited for thirteen minutes; at least he showed a bit of patience.  (Or maybe his torrent started downloading.)
