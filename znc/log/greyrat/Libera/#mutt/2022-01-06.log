[00:20:06] <kevin8t8> bmomjian: good catch on the difference between %S and %Z r vs N behavior!  however, I won't change that behavior because they both have 20+ years of precendence...OCOCOCOCOCOCOCOCOCOC
[00:20:47] <kevin8t8> err... not sure where that trailing OCOCOC came from - sorry about that.
[00:29:31] <bmomjian> Ah, I got it working using index-format-hook, see:  https://momjian.us/tmp/mutt.txt

[00:29:50] <bmomjian> OK, I can imagine the change being harsh.
[00:32:12] <kevin8t8> bmomjian: well, I hope the format-hook at least gives you something you can work with. :)OCOCOCOCOCOCOCOCOCOCOCOC
[00:32:34] <kevin8t8> kevin8t8: how strange.  what they heck is going on with my IRC client...

[00:34:21] <bmomjian> ok, works here.
[00:34:51] <kevin8t8> :)
[00:34:53] <bmomjian> Yes, the format hook gives me access to all the single-letters I would want to see, and most importantly, it doesn't show what would distract me.
[00:35:12] <bmomjian> I never thought about how letters have to override each other in mutt.
[00:36:29] <bmomjian> I guess I realized it when it didn't do what I wanted, but the hook does allow control of this.  :-)
[00:37:37] <kevin8t8> bmomjian: yeah the default flag expandos are a bit hard-coded, but have a long precedence by now. :-/

[01:04:58] <bmomjian> I am liking the hook control, actually.  I remove the dashes for read emails and used blanks.
[01:07:48] <bmomjian> This discussion greatly helped me work through my needs, thanks.
