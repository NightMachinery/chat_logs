[21:23:18] <intrac> hi, I'm trying to download twitch livechat streams, which results in a truncated JSON file
[21:23:43] <intrac> it seems twitch is sending the chat as chunks, with the end of the first file having a reference to the next in sequence
[21:24:25] <intrac> issue is detailed over on the youtube-dl github: https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/issues/25745
[21:25:32] <intrac> I wondered if yt-dlp was likely to address this (I checked the github, but couldn't find any reference)
