[01:28:37] <Panther> The law of success is a two-edged sword. 
[01:31:27] <macrobat> "success" is an abstract thing. 
[01:33:35] <Panther> Ok, but still.. how do you get it?
[01:35:11] <Panther> I doubt that anyone really wants to be unsuccessful.
[01:35:32] <Panther> They might feel resigned to it, ot something, but that isn't the same.
[01:36:49] <Panther> Like, I don't think anyone gets up and says, "You know what? I am gonna really fuck up today as much as I can."
[01:38:33] <macrobat> Self-handicapping is a maladaptive strategy that students employ to protect their self-image when they fear or anticipate academic failure https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-98116-001
[01:38:33] <Janet> ^ APA PsycNet
[01:39:16] <macrobat> but maybe success and non-success isn't always a good dichotomy
[01:40:16] <Panther> I only asked a question... what is the secret to success?
[01:40:34] <Panther> If no one knows, then that's fine, I guess.
[01:41:09] <circuitbone> Competency in specific domains through evidential instantiations, related to your interests.
[01:41:43] <Panther> Those self-handicapping students are using the law of success in the wrong way.. it is a two-edged sword, and that is the other edge.
