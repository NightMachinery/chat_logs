[01:49:26] <Gnotchee> Hi guys.   I have a question about the shuffleframes filter
[01:50:45] <Gnotchee> I have been trying to remove every third frame of 5 to remove duplicate frames in a wrongly converted 24fps viceo source that's been recorded to a DVDR as a 29.97fps video DVD
[01:51:04] <Gnotchee> I'm using this to try to convert
[01:51:27] <Gnotchee> ffmpeg -i C:\Farm\BRS012\title_t01.mkv -filter:v shuffleframes="0 1 -2 3 4",setpts=N/24/TB C:\out.mkv
[01:51:42] <Gnotchee> Can anyone suggest what I may be dong wrong ?
[01:52:11] <Gnotchee> I have tried a few combinations in the shuffleframes filter but every time I get an error.
[01:52:18] <JEEB> so you not only need to decimate but also shuffle fields/frames around?
[01:52:33] <JEEB> since the usual reverse of 24->30 is fieldmatch+decimate
[01:52:58] <Gnotchee> I just need to choose the third frame of 5 to remove and set the frame rate back to 24
[01:53:14] <JEEB> so no reordering needed?
[01:53:23] <JEEB> just removal of X from Y?
[01:54:19] <Gnotchee> The source video is progressive 24fps, wrongly entered onto a 29.97fps timeline with frame2 duplicated to frame 3 of 5
[01:54:49] <JEEB> well if you only need to remove duplicates like that, then decimate might do what you need
[01:54:52] <Gnotchee> Just removal of frame 3 to collapse 5 frames to 4
[01:54:52] <JEEB> http://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#decimate-1
[01:54:55] <JEEB> yea
[01:55:01] <JEEB> sounds like normal IVTC (inverse telecine)
[01:55:20] <JEEB> since the process of putting 24 to 30 is telecine
[01:55:34] <Gnotchee> I dont understand how Decimate works and I need to specify the frame number out of 3v3ry 5
[01:55:35] <JEEB> depending on the content you need to plug fieldmatch before
[01:55:57] <Gnotchee> oops, every 5
[01:56:03] <JEEB> well default is 5 for cycle so that matches :P
[01:56:07] <Gnotchee> what does fieldmatch do ?
[01:56:32] <Gnotchee> reading it now
[01:57:00] <JEEB> it matches fields from interlaced input (since most 30fps / 60 field content is interlaced), and matches them into progressive frames
[01:57:22] <JEEB> if you have no combing in your input it might not be necessary
[02:00:38] <furq> Gnotchee: the dropped frame should be -1
[02:00:58] <furq> 0 1 -1 3 4
[02:01:53] <Gnotchee> The input is not interlaced, as i mentioned beforem the source is 24p and the DVDr Video is 29.97p as in there are no differences in frames although the DVDr is flagged as being interlaced.
[02:02:18] <furq> all dvds are flagged interlaced
[02:03:05] <Gnotchee> furq dropped frames should be -1 ?
[02:03:14] <furq> yeah
[02:03:22] <Gnotchee> I'm not sure how that works as its every 3rd frame out of 5 that is the duplicate.
[02:03:54] <Gnotchee> If I dropped the 1st frame then I would be removing a good non-duplicated frame and leaving a duplicate in the remaining 4
[02:03:54] <furq> -1 just means no frame
[02:04:07] <furq> it has nothing to do with the input frame number
[02:05:31] <Gnotchee> ah,  right so it would be  shuffleframes="0 1 -1 3 4"   ?
[02:05:38] <furq> yeah
[02:06:29] <Gnotchee> does that mean 0 is frame 1, 1 is frame 2, -1 removes the next frame which is frame 3, 3 is frame 4 and 4 is frame five ?
[02:06:36] <AbleBacon> is there a way with ffmpeg to stream live data to a file, and play from that file with the ability to seek?

[02:08:58] <AbleBacon> i didn't think you could seek in a .mkv unless it's been finalized
[02:09:00] <Gnotchee> furq so have I formatted this correctly to bring this back to 24fps and remove the duplicate 3rd frame of 5 ?
[02:09:15] <Gnotchee> ffmpeg -i C:\Farm\BRS012\title_t01.mkv -filter:v shuffleframes="0 1 -1 3 4",setpts=N/24/TB C:\out.mkv
[02:09:24] <furq> that should work
[02:09:34] <furq> you probably want to run a short test clip to check it's ok first
[02:09:43] <furq> -t 30 or whatever
[02:09:52] <Gnotchee> is -vf the same as -filter:v ?
[02:09:55] <furq> yeah
[02:10:07] <furq> AbleBacon: i don't know of any particularly good way to do it
[02:10:18] <furq> most players can seek in streams with no seek index, it's just slow
[02:10:25] <furq> in which case you might be better off using mpegts than mkv
[02:10:29] <AbleBacon> how do video streaming websites do it?
[02:10:37] <AbleBacon> like, you can seek within areas of a stream that you've already downloaded
[02:11:48] <Gnotchee> furq thank you.I don't need to do a short test as I'm processing that at 50x
[02:11:53] <furq> well they usually don't do it very well but probably the naive way
[02:12:00] <Gnotchee> The whole chapter is done now.

[04:31:58] <kepstin> you need to set some encoding properties
[04:32:04] <kepstin> specify an encoder and settings
[04:32:32] <kepstin> (the defaults for mkv in most recent ffmpeg versions are equivalent to "-c:v libx264 -preset medium -crf 23", i think?)
[04:33:13] <kepstin> adjust it to use a slower preset if you can spend the time to improve encoding efficiency, and tweak the value of crf to set the quality (lower numbers are higher quality)
[04:33:40] <kepstin> you should probably also use "-c:a copy", no reason to re-encode the video if you don't need to.

[08:35:00] <aphysically> ahhhh I get so many problems with ffmpeg's dash muxer
[08:35:32] <aphysically> I think ultimately I can't fix them without an extra knob to set the suggested presentation delay, because it defaults to stuff that's unusable sometime and i really don't see a workaround
[08:35:51] <aphysically> plus the hls muxer has subtitle support so I can finally play with that
[08:39:17] <aphysically> it defaults to 1 GOP length which is just unusable in general if players actually respect it
[08:39:24] <aphysically> (and some do, unfortunately)
[08:39:47] <aphysically> I set dash.js to just ignore the value ffmpeg puts there which fixes dash.js, but it doesn't fix everything else
[08:43:24] <aphysically> maybe I can just make a simple patch to fix ffmpeg's bad default for now

[10:19:40] <irc_user> If I cut a video using `ffmpeg -ss 5 -to 10 -i in.mkv out.mp4`, it plays just fine in a video player like mpv, but I couldn't send the cut through any social media platforms or even airdrop it to my phone. I begrudgingly put the cut into imovie and just rendered the whole thing, and then I was able to send it to my friends just fine. Does anybody know what could have been wrong with the file/what imovie may be doing differently?
[10:20:51] <furq> multichannel audio maybe
[10:21:20] <furq> browsers don't like 5.1 aac
[10:21:55] <furq> also you probably want -movflags faststart for browser playback
[10:22:15] <furq> it shouldn't really break anything for a five second long file though
[10:23:31] <irc_user> furq: Oh hmm, so for the audio should I just `-map 0:a:0`?
[10:23:48] <irc_user> or whatever track I want

[20:53:24] <JEEB> for windows and linux you can make a PR to https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/blob/master/scripts.d/50-svtav1.sh
[20:53:28] <JEEB> to update the commit hash
[20:53:49] <JEEB> and then the automated system will build it according to its timer
[20:54:13] <JEEB> if you need something quicker you can read the readme how to build locally
[20:55:49] <JEEB> so if you make a PR to that repo now, tomorrow at midday UTC you'd have the builds :P
[20:55:54] <JEEB> (if it gets merged)
[20:56:50] <JEEB> the hash for that version is https://gitlab.com/AOMediaCodec/SVT-AV1/-/commit/fdf4f36867bba068e221965d12c5975c509845da
