[00:21:16] <empwilli> hm; thanks for the effort but I don't think I've learned a thing now... any pointers to where I can read a little further on the object model? I've looked again into dynamic/static bindings and lexical scopes but there was nothing that helped :/
[00:24:09] <rotateq> there's a lot about CLOS, but you really don't want to be overwhelmed in the beginning of your journey
[00:24:36] <rotateq> you could have a read in Practical Common Lisp, ANSI Common Lisp and Common Lisp Recipes
[00:28:31] <empwilli> hm :/ thanks for the effort
[00:28:55] <rotateq> i can just try
[00:34:33] <pjb> empwilli: a function called definitely open scopes. Not necessarily lexical scope, this depends on whether the symbols used to name the parameters are declared special or not.
[00:35:26] <pjb> (defvar *p* 42) (defun foo (*p*) (list '*p* '=  *p*)) (let ((*p* 33)) (foo 22)) #| --> (*p* = 22) |# 
[00:35:45] <pjb> empwilli: here we have a dynamic scope, with dynamic binding.
[00:36:32] <pjb> empwilli: setf, cons, push, don't mutate the list.  
[00:36:46] <pjb> empwilli: at best, setf and push mutate the variable (the place) where the list is referenced.
[00:36:48] <pjb> but not the list.
[00:37:17] <pjb> empwilli: note that append doesn't mutate the list either: it creates a new list!
[00:37:47] <pjb> empwilli: to mutate a list, you want to use operators such as rplaca, rplacd, nconc, etc.
[00:38:16] <rotateq> so also nreverse and sort ?
[00:38:21] <pjb> empwilli: notice also, that there's a difficulty: in LISP, there is no LIST !!!  There is no abstract data type representing a list. 
[00:38:28] <pjb> rotateq: yes.
[00:38:43] <pjb> empwilli: there is only CONS cells, and the NIL symbol.
[00:39:19] <pjb> empwilli: and there is no way to mutate the NIL symbol into a CONS cell! (change-class 'NIL 'CONS) #| ERROR: There is no applicable method for the generic function:  #<standard-generic-function change-class #x30200002C1DF> when called with arguments:  (nil #<built-in-class cons>) |# 
[00:39:52] <pjb> empwilli: one solution is therefore to use a header cons cell to store the list.

[00:40:48] <empwilli> ok.. there's a lot to unpack here but I think I'll work through this, thanks!

[00:44:01] <empwilli> sorry to disagree, though it's worth to understand why so. asks a thing (see XY-problem) i think one should provide the details ...

[00:45:22] <rotateq> yes but not ALL details, would be way too much every time
[00:45:34] <pjb> empwilli: of course, it is just much simpler to NOT mutate the list, and merely use cons to prepend elements.

[00:47:36] <empwilli> totally agree, but this really bugged me as I didn't get around this one detail, and just programming it the other way round would have worked, but would have kept me wondering :)

[14:56:25] <unixlisp> web ui also
[15:01:32] <beach> Closure was written by gilberth. 
[15:01:42] <beach> bremner: So not the same.
[15:02:00] <unixlisp> from about 97?
[15:02:20] <beach> Sounds a bit early, but it could be.
[15:02:28] <beach> Nah, wait, that can't be.
[15:02:44] <beach> It uses McCLIM, and McCLIM didn't happen until 2000 or so.
[15:07:13] <unixlisp> oh, not ui part. such as css-parse.lisp "Created: 1998-02-08"
[15:08:17] <beach> Either way, I think the concept of a "web browser" is strange.  It is probably due to the braindamaged way that Unix-like systems communicate between processes.  In Common Lisp, it would make much more sense to have a separate module for each kind of object to be rendered, like HTML, PDF, JPG, etc. 
[15:08:56] <unixlisp> yes javascript is common lisp.
[15:08:58] <beach> These module could then use a sane communication technique.

[15:37:48] <random-nick> CLOS uses generic functions instead of message passing, but yes it is inspired by message passing object systems like smalltalk
[15:38:41] <random-nick> I guess the main difference would be that in message passing systems the message is an object while in CLOS and related systems the generic function call isn't an object but the generic function is

[18:06:20] <beach> Right.  We call it "south west".  When we say "south" we typically mean the Mediterranean region.

[18:28:09] <beach> When Edi got a job as a professor, the ECLMs were finished.

[18:28:28] <beach> Yes, they were quite interesting.

[18:28:42] <beach> Definitely.
[18:29:13] <beach> And I like both Amsterdam and Hamburg, so I miss going there.  Of course, with COVID it would have been canceled anyway I suppose.
[18:30:06] <rotateq> yes it has destroyed much, even (normal) relationships between groups of people
[18:30:30] <beach> Indeed.  I am lucky though, because I have my (admittedly small) family living with me.
[18:31:42] <rotateq> great that you are not alone but also I often ask me if we here don't interrupt you at your work or other more important things as you invest so much effort and time
[18:32:39] <beach> Right now, I am in a period with little inspiration, so I try to be useful in other ways. 
[18:32:48] <beach> It's probably this rotten season.
[18:33:39] <rotateq> I'm sure there's much more for the next years.
[18:33:51] <beach> Absolutely.
[18:34:01] <beach> But I should get back to SICL now.  Talk later.
[18:34:28] <rotateq> yes sure, always a pleasure. and I have also some things to work on
[18:36:47] <rotateq> calculating partitions
