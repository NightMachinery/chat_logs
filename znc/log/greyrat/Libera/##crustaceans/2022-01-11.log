[00:04:54] <prussian> looks like it is
[00:05:05] <prussian> though it calls the m$ paper out of date
[00:05:21] <manicennui> "I really detest the use of the word 'training' in relation to professional activities. Training is what you do to dogs. What you should be doing with people is educating them, not training them. There is a big, big difference."
[00:05:26] <manicennui> Hmm.
[00:07:31] <manicennui> "Also you're liable to need help in any C project of significant size; so you're liable to be social and work with others."
[00:07:53] <manicennui> Now the earlier HN comment that I linked to seems even more silly.
[00:15:02] <riv> I don't remember who recommended "Let's Game it Out" but I've probably watched 50 episodes of it since and loved them thank you very much
[00:16:01] <manicennui> I'm sure I did at some point months ago.
[00:16:13] <manicennui> But others might have as well.
[00:16:16] <riv> :D
[00:16:23] <manicennui> That guy's stuff is hilarious.
[00:16:41] <edk> i'm very tired of all the lisp stuff on the site and in #lobsters
[00:16:52] <edk> the sheer fucking level of superiority
[00:17:03] <riv> edk did you see what I pointed out about the author
[00:17:11] <edk> no
[00:17:16] <riv> basically the author sux
[00:17:22] <riv> that loper os guy

[00:19:10] <drakonis> wait what
[00:19:51] <drakonis> the author is an asshole, yeah.
[00:20:25] <drakonis> he posted more about bitcoin than lisp lmao

[00:20:56] <drakonis> even then, he's still a gigantic cock
[00:22:14] <drakonis> it looks like the kind of person that doesnt participate but has the hottest and shittiest takes on things

[00:22:49] <drakonis> its kinda like the lisp curse guy

[01:06:33] <manicennui> What exactly is dang's role on HN? I know that he is an admin for HN or something, but I don't think that he works for YC, but he seems to act as their spokesperson in the comments.
[01:15:02] <companion_cube> he's the main moderator I think
[01:18:10] <manicennui> YC just came up with a really complicated scheme to give startups more money.
[01:18:35] <manicennui> Now they get $125k for 7%, plus $375k, but the equity is determined later when they receive other investments.
[01:19:01] <manicennui> And none of the YC cultists seem to understand how it works.

[01:32:10] <manicennui> I want to believe that it is a real situation.
[01:32:32] <manicennui> I don't know how someone could convince themselves that it is a good idea, but people believe crazier things.

[01:48:03] <manicennui> If these things react, he is going to get destroyed.
[01:48:05] <Xe> but big cats don't usually have the genes for catnip to work on them
[01:48:08] <manicennui> Even if they aren't being aggressive.

[17:56:14] <gerikson> lol I want to print something for my stepson and I have this classic issue where I ... can't print
[17:56:16] <edk> i think the best solution is to depend on smaller numbers of things
[17:56:19] <riv> prussian: yep agreed
[17:56:21] <riv> it would involve real work
[17:56:27] <riv> right now we basically have code slums
[17:56:42] <gwozniak> edk: yes, fewer dependencies is also a good way to go
[17:57:27] <prussian> fun I guess. Every single day I feel like I'm just becoming more and more like the BOFH
[17:57:33] <prussian> I'd rather be coding.
[17:58:39] <prussian> edk: it's not appealing, I agree, and comes with the undesirable diamond dependency problem, but I also think it's basically the only reliable way of doing it.
[17:59:28] <prussian> most these package managers can handle forks and pulling straight from github and that doesn't feel all that different than having source tarballs and patches to apply before building in the C++ side.
[18:02:43] <prussian> I think the problem with the NIH or small dependency mindset is if I did it, I'd probably end up making something like an HTTP/1.1 server that will accidentally lowercase headers wrong and then I'll reinvent new request smuggling bugs. Too much crap in this world for me to read specs on and do right.
[18:11:27] <companion_cube> request smuggling?
[18:12:12] <prussian> making a proxy server do naughty things that allow hitting things in backends that may bypass things like auth and other such things.
[18:12:32] <prussian> usually abusing Content-Length: len or stuff like Transfer-Encoding: chunked
[18:12:57] <companion_cube> like, lying about the length?
[18:13:01] <prussian> yes
[18:13:18] <prussian> and then you'd get partial reads and when the server goes to read more.... hey look at that, a new request.
[18:13:19] <companion_cube> (it's funny because I do have my own little http 1.1 server that handles exactly that :D)
[18:13:20] <prussian> stuff like that.
[18:13:51] <prussian> ya. it's demons. I think golang's had some bug where it used utf8 normalizing and lowercasing on headers. let me find it...
[18:14:05] <companion_cube> :D
[18:14:11] <prussian> but that's my fears of going all NIH is creating the same kinds of subtle spec violations or edge cases.
[18:14:17] <companion_cube> I only use the purest `String.lowercase_ascii`

[18:16:24] <prussian> companion_cube: speaking lowercasing, I always wondered how many bots on IRC are vulnerable to this sort of bug.
[18:16:36] <prussian> most people don't even know about the ISUPPORT and the casemapping types.
[18:16:59] <prussian> hell I don't even know all, other than ascii and rfc1459
[18:17:17] <prussian> anyhow.
[18:23:41] <gwozniak> This got posted in the chat at work, and since I am making the case for Rust as something we should support some day, I was interested: https://hackaday.com/2022/01/09/blink-an-led-on-a-pic32-with-rust-easily/
[18:23:41] <buttsbot> Blink An LED On A PIC32 With Rust, Easily | Hackaday
[18:24:13] <gwozniak> I read the comments and while there is some hope, man... some people really don't know what they are talking about
[18:24:39] <gwozniak> Thinking that LLVM IR is assembly is... something else
[18:25:34] <gwozniak> It's another case of me seeing embedded devs who really don't know their software tools
[18:25:38] <gwozniak> And I see this all the time
[18:26:14] <gwozniak> We get bugs like "I updated the compiler and it takes longer to program [write the ELF image] to the device"
[18:27:27] <prussian> lol
[18:27:37] <gwozniak> What they are completely missing is the fact that the debug info is now larger and it's the tools that read the ELF image that are slow
[18:27:39] <prussian> honestly? most people don't know their tools.
[18:27:51] <prussian> hell, I don't even know half of them
[18:28:01] <gwozniak> So many of our issues seem to be more UI related than anything else
[18:28:10] <prussian> probably
[18:28:30] <companion_cube> prussian: I don't know about ISUPPORT :3
[18:28:36] <prussian> rip...
[18:29:29] <companion_cube> that seems kind of niche IRC stuff, no?
[18:29:42] <prussian> well ya.
[18:29:46] <prussian> how do I say it?
[18:30:15] <prussian> IRC is *simple* as that one article on lobste.rs pointed out, but it's so simple, people just tack shit onto it.
[18:30:18] <prussian> lol
[18:30:41] <companion_cube> heh, sure.
[18:30:52] <companion_cube> writing a bot that works on libera is not hard
[18:30:59] <companion_cube> as long as you stick to the basic features.
[18:31:17] <prussian> lol
[18:31:20] <prussian> ya. even the casemapping is based on the olde timey swedish codepage thing.
[18:31:36] <prussian> [\] -> {|}
[18:31:45] <prussian> or something like that.
[18:31:49] <prussian> anyhow.
[18:32:17] <prussian> gwozniak: I'll take a look at this. I had some hardware project Ideas I had and figured I might as well start them in rust.
[18:32:19] <prussian> just cuz
[18:32:35] <prussian> I used Rust through last year's AoC and actually thought it was nice.
[18:32:58] <prussian> I didn't have that feeling of, "it compiles but... will it explode in my face?"
[18:33:01] <prussian> like I do with C++
[18:33:10] <gwozniak> I am hoping to do some sort of personal project in Rust this year.  I wish I had time at work to try it out
[18:33:54] <prussian> like, bugs happen, obviously, but they weren't weird bugs where all of a sudden a debugger makes a race condition happen kind of bugs.
[18:34:09] <prussian> and by race, I mean like accessing destructed memory or things like that.

[18:38:19] <gwozniak> lol - I actually read the local newspaper at my dining table in the mornings :D
[19:35:59] *** Quits: pja_ (~pja@217.155.153.14) (Quit: WeeChat 3.0.1)
[19:42:51] <edk> prussian: it may be reliable (i have my doubts) but it's just not sufficiently scalable as to work in even trivial cases
[19:44:19] <edk> pinning your dependencies as an end product introduces a lot of churn, but does seem to be viable despite that
[19:46:35] <ngoldbaum> pinning everything is fine if you‚Äôre a leaf node on the dependency graph
[19:46:39] <edk> yes
[19:46:45] <edk> but it's still churny
[19:47:32] <ngoldbaum> but if things depend on you it can be problematic and there really isn‚Äôt a good way to handle that without either having occasional breakage or without things occasionally breaking due to upstream churn that you weren‚Äôt aware of
[19:48:06] <ngoldbaum> ‚Äúoccasional‚Äù can also be ‚Äúquite frequently‚Äù depending on the average amount of churn in your ecosystem
[19:48:12] <edk> i think my ideal solution is "don't pin anything" but that does imply that you need to place a degree of trust in the developers you depend on
[19:48:12] <buttsbot> üëè developers üëè developers üëè developers üëè
[19:48:17] <edk> fuck off buttsbot
[19:48:44] <edk> i think that trust is justified anyway since you're executing their code and making your users execute their code too
[19:49:51] <riv> this is the thing, it's a human problem not a technical problem
[19:54:23] <edk> yes. for my money part of the reason library ecosystems aren't generally healthier is that people are encouraged to write foss for themselves, and not as part of any collaborative effort to enrich the world of open source things
[19:55:41] <edk> projects that attempt to bridge the impedance mismatch between developers and users (like linux distros) are often seen as the enemy, or at least an impediment to be worked around
[19:56:56] <ngoldbaum> imo one of the worst problems for developer trust in the python world was the 2->3 transition, not as such because of the transition but because for like 10 years there was reasonable stability on python2.7 and most library authors worked hard to avoid breakage
[19:57:17] <ngoldbaum> but they got sick of it and with the abandonment of 2.7, suddenly everyone had permission to churn
[19:57:40] <ngoldbaum> that‚Äôs coupled with (at least in the numerical python ecosystem) the increasing availability of funding
[19:58:00] <ngoldbaum> which in my experience may lead to more maintenance but also leads to more downstream churn
[19:58:31] <edk> it definitely feels like a lot of big python libraries embrace the churn now
[19:58:35] <ngoldbaum> numpy has made a number of behavior changes in the last five years which made me dread needing to test new major versions every time
[19:59:34] <edk> part of this is i guess that if python is doing it, what would be the point in trying to maintain compatibility in your python project?
[20:00:09] <edk> they said they'd never do 2->3 again but in practice that seems to mean they do it every release
[20:06:59] <riv> yi've heard that before!
[20:57:27] <Church> Xe: Neat will have to give it a look
[21:25:06] <Xe> Church: it's still just cmd/mkvm
[21:25:15] <Xe> but that's basically all i need in practice
[21:55:45] *** Quits: Seirdy (~Seirdy@sourcehut/user/seirdy) (Quit: exiting 3.3)
[22:31:44] <manicennui> Wow. Some anti-vaxxers outed themselves on Slack at work.
[22:32:00] <manicennui> Some guy threw a temper tantrum and a few others outed themselves as well.
[22:33:31] <manicennui> He wrote up a "legal outline" of his thoughts and expectations.
[22:33:57] <companion_cube> are you implementing a mandatory policy?
[22:34:38] <ngoldbaum> loool
[22:34:49] * ngoldbaum hands manicennui some popcorn
[22:35:27] <dasm> ngoldbaum: is it buttered, carmel or regular one?
[22:35:33] <ngoldbaum> i seriously do not understand at all the hesitancy to get a vaccine that‚Äôs gone in the arms of half of the planet‚Äôs population at this point
[22:35:45] <ngoldbaum> in december 2020, sure
[22:35:46] <manicennui> companion_cube: Yes.
[22:35:51] <manicennui> These people can get fucked.
[22:35:53] <companion_cube> ahahah damn
[22:35:56] <companion_cube> yes please
[22:36:11] <manicennui> One person wrote an agreement stating that he wanted a religious exemption but didn't want to answer the questions as to why.
[22:36:16] <manicennui> And 7 people +1ed it.
[22:36:43] <ngoldbaum> lots of jehovah‚Äôs witnesses suddenly
[22:37:57] <companion_cube> when all the major religions are actually saying "please take the vaccine"
[22:38:16] <companion_cube> the excuse is generally "aborted fetus cells" I think‚Ä¶ that you also find in tylenol and a lot of other things
[22:39:47] <prussian> or basically anything that is some ultra complex looking carbony piece of crap we need to make.
[22:40:02] <prussian> or hamster ovaries or whatever other immortalized cell lines, etc.
[22:41:41] <manicennui> The best response was another employee telling the OP that our work is "at will".
[22:42:12] <manicennui> And this is OP's response: "Nuremburg code - and how is employment ‚Äòat will‚Äô if all employers are doing this?"
[22:42:21] <manicennui> How can you take these people seriously?
[22:43:06] <riv> wow sounds like a fucking HN/lobsters comment thread or something
[22:43:18] <manicennui> Yeah.
[22:43:21] <manicennui> It's pretty wild.
[22:43:25] <companion_cube> :DDDD
[22:43:35] <companion_cube> yep, exactly the same as war crime law
[22:43:45] <prussian> I wish employment was at will.
[22:43:57] <prussian> maybe means people could be fired or hired without this game
[22:44:00] <manicennui> The other guy responded: "I hope you're not using wifi to write this"
[22:44:22] <epilys> manicennui, are you in the US? post this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Service-Members%27_Protection_Act
[22:44:22] <buttsbot> American Service-Members' Protection Act - Wikipedia
[22:44:28] <epilys> basically war crimes are legal
[22:44:32] <manicennui> I'm not getting involved.
[22:44:50] <imode> wise idea.
[22:44:53] <manicennui> My team has a private channel where we are shitting on all of them.
[22:44:57] <imode> better to watch the stupidity from a distance.
[22:45:01] <manicennui> Fortunately the people on my team are sane.
[22:45:36] <prussian> just tell them to fake their vaxx card and shut up. jesus fuck
[22:45:38] <prussian> lmao
[22:45:43] <manicennui> Another juicy bit from his rant: "Insertion of the swab is not desirable; it would fit the legal definition of rape when given to someone that does not want the swab.  Are there testing alternatives that do not involve insertion of a device into an orifice?"
[22:45:58] <imode> cool, hope they die of COVID.
[22:46:03] <epilys> oh wow
[22:46:16] <manicennui> I'm sure this guy spent a lot of time on this.
[22:46:25] <imode> as opposed to doing work.
[22:46:26] <ngoldbaum> really showing their ass
[22:46:31] <manicennui> It is quite long and doesn't seem like stream of consciousness.
[22:46:40] <manicennui> imode: I don't care about that. Fuck my employer.
[22:46:41] <ngoldbaum> i hope a woman reports him to HR because of that rape comment
[22:47:09] <imode> same.
[22:47:18] <companion_cube> prussian: for these extra salty anecdata where people check in as the hospital for covid, and are scared because they had a fake vaccine card
[22:48:03] <prussian> ü§∑
[22:48:13] <prussian> I just don't get doing these gymnastics.
[22:48:14] <ngoldbaum> i was searching for covid tests on amazon and noticed you can still buy blank vaccine cards from them
[22:48:22] <manicennui> I don't get why they go to the hospital, then their family blames the hospital when they die.
[22:48:26] <manicennui> Just stay at home and die.
[22:48:35] <prussian> no one cares, or cares so much they have to make rape equivocations?
[22:48:40] <prussian> ok, fake up
[22:48:42] <prussian> yolo
[22:48:45] <companion_cube> apparently, when you're drowning you kind of panic, who knew
[22:49:00] <manicennui> Can't one of these idiots put up some plans for a ventilator that doesn't work so the others can try to treat themselves?
[22:49:10] <ngoldbaum> prussian: a certain kind of deranged fox news poisoned brain with legalistic tendencies
[22:49:19] <prussian> ya I guess.
[22:49:20] <prussian> true
[22:49:26] <companion_cube> ohhh oh oh oh, manicennui, can you find out if they're sovereign citizens?
[22:49:38] <manicennui> companion_cube: Again, I'm not getting involved.
[22:49:41] <prussian> still though.
[22:49:42] <prussian> jesus
[22:49:52] <ngoldbaum> yeah it‚Äôs all pretty grin
[22:49:54] <ngoldbaum> grim
[22:50:04] <manicennui> One of the guys who +1ed the rant is a Trump fan libertarian type.
[22:50:08] <prussian> sovereign citizens are the best.
[22:50:14] <manicennui> We had to agree not to talk about politics at some point.
[22:51:10] <manicennui> One of the people on my team in our private channel: "Maybe he thinks he‚Äôs on reddit?"
[22:51:39] <prussian> duh
[22:53:33] <prussian> when people say dumb shit at work, that I know will cause drama, I usually just try and smooth things and change the subject
[22:54:00] <companion_cube> I'm lucky, I just have one musk fan and that's it
[22:55:10] <riv> how is it possible to be a musk fan :/
[22:55:23] <imode> same way it's possible to be a bezos fan. billionaire worship.
[22:55:32] <riv> no one is a fan of bezos
[22:56:05] <companion_cube> I can understand why musk rather than bezos, at least
[22:56:14] <manicennui> prussian: There are over 1200 people in this slack channel. I don't even know most of them.
[22:56:43] <manicennui> Yeah, is anyone an actual fan of Bezos?
[22:56:52] <companion_cube> bezos himself
[22:56:52] <manicennui> He doesn't seem very cool.
[22:57:32] <manicennui> I promise to be 10x cooler and dumber than Musk if you make me a billionaire.
[22:57:35] <prussian> i don't know about worship, but I find it both insanely unusual, hilarious and almost praise-worthy how child-like musk is.
[22:57:39] <prussian> and how rich he is.
[22:57:47] <manicennui> But the dumb shit I do will be cool.
[22:58:07] <prussian> whoa
[22:58:12] <prussian> buut then would it be dumb?
[22:58:16] <prussian> or just good PR?
[22:58:20] <manicennui> It can be both!
[22:58:36] <manicennui> prussian: I'd do so much crazy good shit for cats.
[22:58:45] <manicennui> Some people would see it as dumb.
[22:59:38] <manicennui> My dumb tweets? Cats.
[23:00:37] <manicennui> Cat research, shelters...
[23:00:42] <prussian> genius.
[23:01:10] <manicennui> Phase two is where I fund a bunch of really weird art that is actually good.

[23:47:09] <manicennui> I feel like you have to be pretty ignorant of everything in tech to think that blockchain solves a real problem.
[23:50:55] <manicennui> And ignorant of the realities of humanity to believe that most of these problems are technical in nature.
[23:51:28] <manicennui> Also ignorant of what property rights actually are, and why they exist at all.
