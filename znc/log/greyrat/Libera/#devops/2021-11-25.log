[00:12:49] <Joel> lantech19446 in terms of difficult in aws I would say it's billing as the hardest, and for whatever reason, a lot of peopel find IAM really hard.
[00:13:11] <lantech19446> IAM?
[00:14:39] <slaughter> Identity and access management
[00:14:56] <slaughter> JSON blobs that say what permissions a user or resource has etc
[00:15:04] <Joel> lantech19446 if you can't google "aws <term here>" you're going to have a long road ahead of you
[00:16:24] <lantech19446> if I can't ask questions of people with far more experience than I have I'm also going to have a long road ahead of me. I was looking for precisely the answer slaughter gave me not some long detailed article about it right now
[00:18:00] <Joel> You're going to have a hard time in ##aws.
[00:19:36] <lantech19446> I don't know if i'll even join it then. I don't need drama filled channels, I use these to relax
[00:20:34] <Joel> You seem like you'd fit my company culture.
[00:22:03] <lantech19446> I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing considering the last 3 minutes lol
[00:25:29] <Joel> An employer has two candidates in front of them, one is a self starter, and eager to learn, the other demands to know what the company will teach them. Who do you think the company hires?
[00:26:53] <lantech19446> from the sounds of things your company hires the latter
[00:27:07] <Joel> We don't. That was sarcasm. 
[00:27:53] <kubblai> the problem is that to some companies a self starter means they wont provide training or any time to do it
[00:28:34] <lantech19446> kubblai: that's what i run into most often, it used to be standard to give people training to help them get started in the company
[00:28:51] <kubblai> and should be ongoing too
[00:29:02] <lantech19446> I don't need any more sarcasm in my life though he's gone
[00:29:21] <lantech19446> kubblai: preferably but apparently that would be a horrible thing to someone like joel
[00:29:25] <Joel> kubblai yeah, as an employee, the trick is sussing that out with a little grace :)
[00:30:32] <Joel> I typically do things like. "In my first two weeks, who would I be pairing with to get comfortable with the ins and outs?", "Do you have a review process for IaC so I can get feedback to make sure I contribute in an expected manner?"
[00:30:33] <Joel> etc
[00:31:08] <Joel> Training is always easy too, "I saw X class on Y date, if we decide I become a good fit, can you approve this training for me?"

[00:31:56] <Joel> "tell me or gtfo" == hard pass.
[00:33:11] <kubblai> im actually worried i started at the wrong place this month, got a massive payrise but everyone seems to be leaving the place and im getting very little in the way of a structured induction plenty of HR stuff but no one has set me down and told me what they expect of me. found an issue with a server today using http with domain logins through a web ui, reported it to infosec they didnt even know why it was an issue
[00:33:14] <lantech19446> btw I can take a joke, what I don't need is people being an asshole at my expense. I google shit all day long I really don't think it's such an offense to ask a question
[00:33:34] <Joel> kubblai I read that as you're already proving your worth!
[00:33:41] <lantech19446> oh jesus
[00:33:58] *** Joins: Echoz (~chris@user/echoz)
[00:34:12] <lantech19446> even my works website is https and we don't handle any PII on that server
[00:34:22] <kubblai> randomly saw a code review today with a hardcoded sftp pw plus aws keys hardcoded. when i questioned it was told but its urgent
[00:35:13] <kubblai> its not what im used to since i worked in defense before
[00:35:22] <Joel> kubblai I've had a client like that, on one hand it's so easy to prove your worth, on another it's frustrating to try and drag them forward from 15 years ago
[00:36:06] <kubblai> also i've come from gitlab and using atlassian products kill me but thats minor :)
[00:36:16] <lantech19446> The issues you're raising aren't issues that only apply to defense level security though, everyone should be consciensous (sp) of them
[00:36:25] <Joel> kubblai ugh, self hosted, or SaaS?
[00:36:37] <kubblai> self hosted (and vry out of date)
[00:36:44] <Joel> I got out of bamboo JUST as they where supporting IaC for pipelines...
[00:37:43] <kubblai> if i change jobs now the wife will kill me since i work at a giant comglomerate that shes always wanted to work at
[00:39:03] <lantech19446> I'm torn on what i'd do in your situation, on one side of the coin I see an opportunity to really improve things but it sounds like they don't want to improve so I might just walk away too because if there's a breach it's your career that's going to take the hit not them
[00:40:26] <Joel> kubblai get her hired, then bail :P
[00:40:34] <kubblai> haha
[00:42:02] <Joel> I'm at the point where I'm just happy to improve anyone's setup
[00:42:13] <Joel> Close enough to retiring I just look for someone who appreciates me
[00:44:00] <kubblai> my cat appreciates me
[00:44:48] <lantech19446> lol it's not a cat then
[00:45:11] <kubblai> Joel i think its really tough to find a company with similar goals to yourself
[00:45:24] <Joel> kubblai agreed
[00:46:04] <lantech19446> hey does anyone here program with java that might be able to answer a question about arrays for a friend?
[00:46:05] <kubblai> i left defense coz im a buddhist but actually the company i worked was really good on things like employee wellbeing and happiness. I even taught meditation classes
[00:46:43] <kubblai> lantech19446 you're probs better off in another channel
[00:46:55] <Joel> kubblai getting to teach meditation classes sounds incredibly fulfilling 
[00:46:58] <lantech19446> ok
[00:47:25] <kubblai> it really was Joel
[00:47:38] <kubblai> but i dont agree with blowing ppl up
[00:48:46] <Joel> kubblai some times one has to take of themselves to take care of others
[00:48:54] <Joel> But I respect you for being true to yourself
