[05:05:57] <dre> do we still not have a way to reliably reload plugin code that we're currently writing? 
[05:06:42] <dre> ie: I'm writing some module, I test it with `:lua require('derp').run()` -- make some more changes, I have to reload neovim for it to "reload correctly" ?  
[05:07:01] <dre> I really envy the emacs lisp guys
[05:07:49] <mjlbach[m]> plenary provides a reload function, but it's a short snippet
[05:08:06] <mjlbach[m]> https://github.com/nvim-lua/plenary.nvim/blob/b42e0cfe22ad3a0cac35cf14315e9dc22cea2ec9/lua/plenary/reload.lua
[05:18:30] <dre> is it reliable?
[05:19:15] <dre> I remember there being some bugs (including what i went through last night) i think, where the only "solution" is to restart nvim and try again. 
[05:19:51] <dre> something like nvim_set_win_cursor(winid, {3,4}) didn't work, until after I restarted nvim  (maybe a couple of times???)

[06:19:26] <buu> oh
[06:19:32] <buu> That's.. tricky.
[06:19:59] <buu> Ok, great.
[06:20:27] <buu> Follow up: can I arrange things such that I use tab to select a popup menu item (coc completion) and then hitting any key accepts it?
[06:21:18] <buu> So, like, I type "os.Foo" which ia snippet that expands to "os.Foo(|)" and I type "os.F" and I get a menu with "os.Foo ~" then I hit tab, select that, then type "a" and end up with the text "os.Foo(a)" ?
[06:22:42] <buu> And would this require setting every remapping every insertable key to something like :imap a pumap() ? <C-y>a : a ?
[06:22:46] <buu> And is this a terrible idea?

[07:28:34] <mjlbach[m]> I assume most people just install coc-java or nvim-jdtls and be done with it
[07:30:23] <pun> mjlbach[m]: I don't know how to describe this but it kinda feels wierd having just migrated from coc and then having it again for coc-java. 
[07:31:47] <mjlbach[m]> Well then use nvim-jdtls :) 
[07:31:51] <pun> ohh, I didn't see the "or". Sorry
[07:32:24] <pun> I couldn't get it to work properly so that's why I want to take a look at some dotfiles. 
[07:33:06] <mjlbach[m]> Did you copy/paste this https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-jdtls#configuration into  ~/.config/nvim/ftplugin/java.lua modifying the skull portions?

[07:34:56] <pun> no, since I already use nvim-lsp-installer I wanted to leverage it. https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-jdtls/issues/156, I probably should have followed the initial config first.

[07:36:14] <mjlbach[m]> It's in the wiki for nvim-jdtls. I would recommend getting nvim-jdtls before adding the complexity of nvim-lsp-installer

[08:36:18] <pun> I think I'm misunderstanding something. When configuring a server, doesn't "root_dir" stop the server from launching ? For example https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/lua/lspconfig/server_configurations/angularls.lua#L36, angularls won't start if those two entities are not found in the current working directory right ? ( it's just an example, I'm not having problems with angularls
[08:36:20] <pun> ) 
[08:39:03] <pun> I'm trying to figure out why jdtls gets started everytime, even when I just open neovim on a random file which has nothing to do with java.
[08:39:29] <pun> Do all lsps get started and only get attached if the conditions are met ?
[08:43:52] <mjlbach[m]> Nvim-jdtls doesn't use lspconfig
[08:45:16] <mjlbach[m]> The way it works, is a filetype autocommand executes a search up the filesystem hierarchy for the "root_dir" pattern, if it's detected, the server is launched and sent that root directory so it can do project-wide functions (like goto definition), if it's not, and single_file_support is true for the config, a scratch server is started for the parent directory of the file and all buffers under that same parent directory are attached to the
[08:45:16] <mjlbach[m]> same server
[08:45:45] <mjlbach[m]> that's for lspconfig though, I don't know how jdtls works, I assume that if you copy/paste the jdlts config into a filetype/java.lua it will only attach on Java filetypes

[09:02:00] <pun> mjlbach[m]: Thank you for the explanation. I knew about nvim-jdtls not using lspconfig I just thought that what I was talking about is a generally agreed upon pattern.  I think it's related to this: https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-jdtls/issues/130
[09:03:38] <pun> all in all, I just actually noticed your name. Thanks for the work on lspconfig. 
[09:05:07] <mjlbach[m]> You are welcome :) My reading of https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-jdtls#configuration indicates it should do the same as lspconfig, find a root and only attach to (java) files under that root
[09:05:28] <mjlbach[m]> but that probably has to go inside a java filetype file, otherwise it would be called on all files

[17:00:35] <dundargoc> The ctrl-] is buggy in some cases. It can't handle dashes for example. In your case it might be the colon, ":", that makes it not work.
[17:02:06] *** Joins: gully (~alex@84.66.114.82)
[17:05:56] <ii14[m]> it's not buggy, the behavior depends on `iskeyword`

[23:03:14] <mjlbach[m]> A more effective way of asking that question, instead of speculating about the existence of a new progress handler, would be to state exactly what your issue is "With lua-language-server, I am getting the error message 'LSP[id=3] client has shut down after sending the message' which is thrown here. Can someone tell me why this might be happening?"
[23:03:46] <kylo252[m]> I did ask, and even pointed to the line that's triggering the issue
[23:03:55] <mjlbach[m]> > anyone else having issues with the new progress handler?

[23:20:14] <mjlbach[m]> Specifically what implements it is https://github.com/mjlbach/neovim/blob/0d7a97224f28cdf47d7ecc80b6d300c8c67c0b29/runtime/ftplugin/python.vim#L122-L131
[23:21:55] <mjlbach[m]> tbh you probably want a language server client plugin with clangd/ccl
[23:21:56] <mjlbach[m]> s/ccl/ccls/
[23:22:01] <mjlbach[m]> there are many options
[23:22:29] <kylo252[m]> mjlbach[m]: I'll see on the off-chance it's mentioned :)
[23:22:29] <kylo252[m]> https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/16772/files
[23:22:32] <minutestoseconds> mjlbach[m]: Do you use it for cpp ?
[23:22:49] <mjlbach[m]> I use it for everything
[23:23:15] <mjlbach[m]> options are coc, language-client_neovim, vim-lsp, vim-lsp, and the one built-into neovim
[23:23:25] <mjlbach[m]> probably a dozen others I'm forgetting
[23:23:29] <minutestoseconds> I need it language server for cpp and python
[23:23:46] <mjlbach[m]> sure
[23:23:49] <mjlbach[m]> those exist
[23:24:38] <minutestoseconds> mjlbach[m]: Are these all for cpp ?
[23:24:46] <kylo252[m]> ironically, it may not tell you what `static` is, but otherwise it's better than everything you've **ever** used for anything with cpp development
[23:26:30] <mjlbach[m]> Those are plugins that communicate with language servers
[23:26:36] <mjlbach[m]> your options for language servers are ccls or clangd
[23:26:36] *** Quits: scoobydoo (~scooby@user/scoobydoo) (Read error: Connection timed out)
[23:26:44] <mjlbach[m]> for python it's pyright or pylsp
[23:26:54] <minutestoseconds> Oh ok
[23:27:29] <minutestoseconds> Vim plug is what i use to manage plugins
[23:27:36] <mjlbach[m]> sure
[23:27:44] <mjlbach[m]> it doesn't matter, you can install plugins with whatever plugin manager you want
[23:28:45] *** Joins: scoobydoo (~scooby@user/scoobydoo)
[23:28:51] <minutestoseconds> Ok
[23:28:51] <minutestoseconds> Ill try integration language server hope its not very hard
[23:29:13] <kylo252[m]> I think tj, or maybe even chris recently, have made some basic tutorials on LSP that you can find on youtube. or just check any of the top results I guess
[23:29:23] *** Quits: lagash (lagash@lagash.shelltalk.net) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[23:29:45] <mjlbach[m]> I mean you can just copy/paste the example configurations from any of the plugin readmes
[23:29:54] <minutestoseconds> kylo252[m]: ChrisOnMachine ?
[23:29:55] <mjlbach[m]> I'd recommend not relying on youtube tutorials, they get stale very quickly
[23:30:33] <kylo252[m]> mjlbach[m]: I was thinking more in the way of just explaining what it is
[23:31:00] <mjlbach[m]> there is one application that analyzes your code, the other application is neovim, they talk by sending json packets to/from each other
[23:31:06] <mjlbach[m]> done
[23:31:07] <kylo252[m]> kylo252[m]: in a tl;dr way ^
[23:31:59] <minutestoseconds> mjlbach[m]: Ok, but they are very intrusive insome cases
[23:31:59] <minutestoseconds> Had someone apply it to my nvim, ended up deleting it because it autocompleted every single word lol ðŸ¤£
[23:32:13] <mjlbach[m]> Well
[23:32:22] <mjlbach[m]> many plugins assume you want autocompletion
[23:32:27] <mjlbach[m]> I personally despise autocompletion

[23:33:46] <minutestoseconds> C+n is ok for me for auto completion
[23:33:46] <minutestoseconds> Having auto closing bracket would be nice if i open a bracket/quote
[23:33:47] <kylo252[m]> mjlbach[m]: did you try the completion dial in clangd? 
[23:34:06] *** Quits: dontreallycare (~butler@adsl-178-38-36-59.adslplus.ch) (Quit: certainly not the default)
[23:34:17] <mjlbach[m]> > <@minutestoseconds:matrix.org> C+n is ok for me for auto completion
[23:34:17] <mjlbach[m]> > Having auto closing bracket would be nice if i open a bracket/quote
[23:34:17] <mjlbach[m]> that can/should be done not via LSP
[23:34:34] <mjlbach[m]> c+n is not autocompletion
[23:34:37] <mjlbach[m]> that's just completion
[23:35:03] <minutestoseconds> Oh yead
[23:35:03] <minutestoseconds> Context based completion*
[23:35:27] <minutestoseconds> s/yead/yeah/
[23:35:31] <mjlbach[m]> language servers provide better completion candidates than ctags/things built-in to vim
[23:35:35] <kylo252[m]> if you're responding to my question, it's more that it can/should make it more reasonable

[23:47:53] <dundargoc> 2. Leader key is just a "special key" that isn't used by vim (like e.g. backslash) to define your own mappings without writing over existing mappings.
[23:48:19] <dundargoc> There's probably more info if you do :h <leader>
[23:54:49] <dundargoc> You can use :only to maximize current window.
