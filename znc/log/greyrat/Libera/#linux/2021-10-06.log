[00:01:22] <Guest4390> Hey all. Does anyone know how I could alias a command that spans multiple words? For example, making it so when I type "foo bar", it runs "egg". Using Zshell on a 2019 MacBook pro for reference (my apologies, I know this is #linux but the question seems Unix-adjacent so I thought maybe it'd be permissible :P )

[00:03:58] <jim> Guest4390, foo would have to interpret bar

[00:04:57] <jim> asgas, also which dist?
[00:05:23] <Guest4390> ohh now that's clever! I might have to try that :)  (the making a dummy foo program, that when given argument bar runs egg, else just runs the actual foo program)
[00:05:58] <tangy> yeah, it's your basic nightmare

Your cursor will jump to the next such character. Include Alt (the meta key) and it will instead jump to the previous such character.

[01:04:59] <TheGuestMovie> Just spent 30 minutes looking for a tabbed SSH connection manager that comes close to MobaXTerm on Windows. Here's my reviews of the top-recommended Linux alternatives: 1) Remmina: more GTK trash. I couldnt enter my username in the SSH connection dialog on Ubuntu 20.04.  2) muon/snowflake: Nice UI but ghetto functionality. Doesnt let you pass
[01:05:00] <TheGuestMovie> anything to the SSH client, so X11 forwarding can never be used. Weird Java app, only comes with a binary installer, with no uninstaller.  3) Asbru: yet more trash. Their AppImage (the only release they make) failed to run on Ubuntu 20.04, and from their Github, also openSUSE and Arch. The dev gave up because he doesn't know how to fix it.
[01:05:17] <TheGuestMovie> So I'm going to the best solution, running MobaXTerm on Linux in wine. How avant-garde.

[03:51:01] <Jersten> Yes but all those people hate systemD for a reason. Iirc the main argument was something like... they still can't actually tell what it's doing. Or something along those lines

[06:27:23] <mags>  omg, blackflagAvenj: because torify will inherit the the exported path from .bashrc!

[06:27:31] <jim> blackflagAvenj, because bash interprets the "torify fetch"
[06:27:35] <neshpion> and the same quoting/expansion problem exists
[06:27:53] <rascul> bashrc sets up the environment that torify uses
[06:28:12] <jim> but, I think that's right, torify fetch will also not find fetch
[06:28:16] <dieggsy> blackflagAvenj: you are setting the PATH environment variable in the .bashrc. torify inherits the PATH from its environment. that's it. that's the connection. it doesn't have "nothing" to do with torify, exactly. you're taking that too literally. plus, if you'd actually try any of our suggestions, instead of yelling, you might get farther
[06:28:17] <blackflagAvenj> so what neshpion
[06:28:29] <neshpion> so what, what?
[06:28:30] <blackflagAvenj> given my steps taken
[06:28:40] <blackflagAvenj> it runs outside of torify
[06:28:50] <neshpion> do your steps taken include changing your literal ~ into $HOME?
[06:29:02] <dieggsy> blackflagAvenj: how are you running it outside of torify? paste the exact command
[06:29:09] <dieggsy> because you said yourself "which fetch" returned nothing
[06:29:12] <itt788> are /tmp /var/tmp and ~/.cache the only places needing regular user intervention to clear up?
[06:29:19] <dieggsy> so I don't really believe it runs outside of torify without a full qualified path
[06:29:36] <blackflagAvenj> but not found with torify if as is said the export already encompasses the subprocess torify why should it not find it becausebof whatbis containesnin .bashrc
[06:29:40] <dieggsy> unless you're using some FUNKY shell jaja
[06:30:10] <dieggsy> blackflagAvenj: the path is incorrect.

[06:39:19] <blackflagAvenj> it feels like a clone
[06:39:22] <neshpion> blackflagAvenj: it seems 'torify' is a shell script wrapper around 'torsocks', which is a shell script.. reading through that, i find the line under `torify_att()` function: `local app_path="$(command -v "$1")"` -- this means that the argument you give to torify, aka "fetch", is passed as the arg to `command -v` which prints "a single word indicating the command or filename used to invoke command",
[06:39:24] <neshpion> but that is subject to correct PATH expansion since "Only builtin commands or commands found in the PATH are executed" (according to `man bash`).   all this to say: torify/torsocks needs your PATH to be set up correctly in order to work

[06:58:01] <a1> this is good
[06:58:02] <dieggsy> which means, however you set the path for bash, that will be the path that torify tries to read
[06:58:08] <blackflagAvenj> if it inherits the variables it should run exactly the same fetch vs torify fetch
[06:58:08] <neshpion> blackflagAvenj: because with a quoted "~", the PATH environment variable will contain a literal ~ instead of the actual home directory, and that erroneous path will be inherited by subprocesses

[06:59:57] <neshpion> also it was said before that `which fetch` returned nothing

[07:00:07] <blackflagAvenj> ok
[07:00:26] <blackflagAvenj> so the bashrc becomes the environment
[07:00:31] <ayecee> neshpion: right. which, not being part of the shell, would also interpret it differently.
[07:00:47] <rascul> bash actually will do tilde expansion on a quoted "~/foo" when you run it manually

[07:01:08] *** Joins: fikran (~fikran@user/fikran)
[07:01:08] <jim> neshpion, so then torify should generally use the same heuristic bash does: if it finds a / char in the command string that was fed to it in an argument, it should not try to traverse $PATH, instead, should take the argument string as the full path to the executable (and by 'full' I don't necessarily mean 'fully qualified' or 'absolute', as it could specify the path to the dir and still be relative)
[07:01:34] <ayecee> rascul: it seems like bash does the expansion when a literal ~ is in $PATH too

[20:53:09] <hexnewbie> HiccupJul: You need to choose a process to steal the TTY from. Usually it doesn't matter which with -T, but I go for the topmost one... I think
[20:53:13] <Guest55andveryst> but why is that necessary? wouldn't execute just `vim` do that already?
[20:53:14] <Dagmar> menace: Basically the difference between 5 and 6 is that 6 uses twice the parity bits, specifically so that two drives could be dead at once and at least you're okay if nothing _else_ goes wrong

[20:54:52] <hexnewbie> HiccupJul: For the exercise, consider the pts/xx (for a given xx) a group, and pick the process topmost in the ‘ps auxf’ tree in that pts/xx to call reptyr -T on
[20:54:57] <HiccupJul> they all have unique pid

[20:56:39] <Descartes> Half the time I try to open or copy and paste a file I get permission denial
[20:56:49] <Dagmar> The actual _problem_ is going to involve which userid you're using, and what the rights are on the things you're trying to modify
[20:56:57] <Guest55andveryst> why would the /dev/tty redirect fix that?
[20:57:10] <HiccupJul> PS and htop don't display ppid...
[20:57:11] <Descartes> I'm using my regular user Id.  Only have one user ID
[20:57:18] <ayecee> Guest55andveryst: my guess is that the redirects with < and > make sure vim gets its input from octave, and that the output goes to octave, so octave can show it correctly
[20:57:22] <Dagmar> ...and one big hint to you is going to be "what is telling you 'permission denied'"

[21:48:47] <nova> fun question: any way to run windows and linux at same time on one machine (like parallels did for OS X & WiDnOs)?
[21:49:01] <Psi-Jack> To have tire and tyre as two completely differently spelled words, and mean something completely different, when only England does it. Well, that's why Merriam-Webster standardized English first.

[23:39:15] <Caffeinated> #html, #css
[23:39:16] <Dagmar> There's just really great SEO for discussions about a _proposed_ <multicol> tag
[23:39:39] <Dagmar> ...which were eventually thrown away entirely in favor of just slapping the attribute on any old div you want.
[23:39:51] <Dagmar> Hence, the swearing
[23:39:57] <akk> I finally went and read about flex and grid, and grid can solve a lot of problems. flex, not so much.
[23:40:16] <Dagmar> Give it time.  Flex has it's uses
[23:40:55] <Dagmar> Most of them involve things where you probably don't even realize it's there

[23:41:09] <akk> The layout I wanted seemed perfect for flex, but I couldn't make it work, and finally found a couple pages saying oh, yeah, it doesn't work in these cases, so they ended up adding grid which is like flex done right.
[23:41:11] <Dagmar> ...usually because you're only using one screen.

[23:41:33] <Dagmar> Flex is _way_ more important to layouts which may change based on whatever someone decided they wanted to browse it on
[23:41:49] <akk> Yeah, a lot of flex/grid applications for me come when I'm trying to do layout that re-lays-out on phone screens.

[23:57:18] <AtomicInteger> `less` is kinda default. I was hoping for some colored output.
[23:58:24] <keir> coloring doesn't have much to do with the pager, in the context of less.
[23:58:33] <keir> less can show color fine
