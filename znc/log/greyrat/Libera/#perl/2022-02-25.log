[18:56:33] <Altreus> very confused by git right now... my conflict says that the code was deleted in HEAD, but I can't find any log in which it was deleted
[18:57:26] <Altreus> in fact I can only find commits I made, in which I added it - so how can I have a conflict?

[19:42:52] <simcop2387> Altreus: this is why i generally refuse to do any rebases unless absolutely necessary.  time travelling like that tends to make errors and conflicts more confusing than they need to be.

[19:59:51] <Altreus> yes, you either have to always rebase or never rebase
[20:00:16] <Altreus> Personally I will always advocate a rebase over a merge, but if everyone's already merging, rebasing is just doomed
[20:00:41] <Altreus> It would have been fine but I forgot that this branch doesn't work on master yet, and now I have to rebase some of it back off master again :(
