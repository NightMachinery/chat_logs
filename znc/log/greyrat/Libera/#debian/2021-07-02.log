[00:03:26] <cpach> PMT: it says stuff like this: https://paste.debian.net/hidden/6cc23ce1/
[00:03:58] <cpach> ratrace: exactly. i was wondering if anyone would mind having a look at the unit, to see if it's correctly written.
[00:03:59] <greycat> (why can I never remember whether it's hplain or plainh, I swear I guess wrong *every* time...)
[00:04:35] <greycat> cpach: all I see there are log lines from sudo, nothing to do with your custom unit
[00:04:40] <PMT> greycat: clearly you should alias one to the other
[00:04:53] <jmcnaught> cpach: what does "systemctl status webhook" say?
[00:05:00] <greycat> PMT: I don't think I have the ability to create aliases within the debian paste web site
[00:05:20] <PMT> Oh, I see, you meant the URL.
[00:05:34] <greycat> anyway, the raw version of the second URL is https://paste.debian.net/plainh/6cc23ce1/ for anyone else who needs it

[00:11:47] <cpach> ok i was confused. sorry folks. it was the previous unit file that was b0rked. this one is working fine.
[00:12:00] <cpach> jmcnaught: it actually is active now
[00:12:03] <cpach> thank you folks
[00:13:02] <cpach> i was under the impression that running 'journalctl --unit=webhook.service -n 200 --no-pager' would show a log message when webhook was started
[00:13:10] <cpach> seems like it didn't show that(?)
[00:13:22] <cpach> but 'systemctl status webhook' confirmed that it's running
[00:13:56] <greycat> journalctl has a --follow option which may do what you're looking for

[02:45:08] <ryo> beside that you could check the VM config, "input typ=Keyboard..." if the line contains something unusual. In debian it's in /etc/libvrit/qemu, not sure where in centos
[02:45:52] <jim> powerhouse_, when you look at the debian, does it present a graphical display (inside your graphical display), or is it more like a text terminal?

[02:48:56] <powerhouse_> looking now
[02:49:46] <powerhouse_> what am I missing here "negative.  In debian my keyboard is putting / and accentegues and when I use the pipe I get a capital A with a slant on the top.  Any idea how to change the keyboard?"

[02:52:00] <powerhouse_> sorry
[02:52:09] <powerhouse_> text didnt copy from vm my bad
[02:52:46] <jim> if the command is short, I guess for now best to type it
[02:52:51] <powerhouse_> I typed "dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration" | got "bash: dpkg-reconfigure: command not found"
[02:53:03] <powerhouse_> dpkg is installed
[02:53:03] <dpkg> powerhouse_: are you smoking crack?
[02:53:54] <PMT> powerhouse_: I believe you'll get that if the command is not run with sudo

[02:54:25] <powerhouse_> Okay sweet! allows me to select my keyboard type!
[02:55:37] <powerhouse_> okay I changed to Microsoft keyboard.  Still has same issue.

[08:42:01] <sney> I would remove the last part of the command first, and see what the oneliner prints, before passing it to apt-get 
[08:42:48] <sney> but by default debian only keeps 2 kernels installed: the one you're running right now, and the previous one. so usually autoremove is the only thing you need, if at all

[08:58:19] <wr> so it would be safe to use it
[08:58:28] <sney> when you see something like this, try running the individual pieces, so you understand what they do. then the whole command will make more sense. 
[08:58:44] <sney> if you do the whole thing as a mysterious magic spell, nothing is "safe"

[09:07:06] <sney> I meant to do that *after* you run your script
[09:07:16] <sney> yes. you can remove 6 and 16. 
[09:07:41] <sney> by default, debian would keep 16 installed as long as you are using 17. but if you don't want that, you can remove 16.

[09:09:00] <sney> wr: "linux-image-amd64" is not a kernel package, it's a metapackage that is part of the system that keeps your kernel updated. currently you have 3 kernels: -6, -16, and -17.

Looks like apt is not listing package that is already installed and can be listed by dpkg -l , so when running apt upgrade, it tries to install this package but fails with broken dependecies.

[18:33:36] <jelly> redgloboli, is eth1 supposed to be up the whole time?  If so, replace "allow-hotplug eth1" with "auto eth1", and see if that makes any difference (after a reboot I'm afraid)

[18:55:30] <redgloboli> when i switched the eth1.190 on the upper position the route is added btw.

[21:42:29] <dpkg> Release-Critical bugs are Debian bugs with critical, grave or serious severities, preventing the next release of Debian.  See the graph at http://bugs.debian.org/release-critical/ or the lists at http://bugs.debian.org/release-critical/other/all.html  http://udd.debian.org/bugs.cgi?release=bullseye&patch=ign&pending=ign&merged=ign&done=ign&rc=1  .  See also <rc-alert>.
[21:42:45] <anddam> howdy, willing to run a webserver as user, what should I use system-wide to act as a proxy?
[21:43:13] <sney> nginx makes a good reverse proxy.
[21:43:45] <velix> sney: thanks
[21:43:49] <anddam> ok, so nginx and then setup a stanza for foohost.mydomain.invalid to proxy the user server, bound on a non-privileged port
[21:43:53] <anddam> sney: right?right
[21:44:11] <anddam> only one "right" there
[21:44:30] <sney> sort of, look up nginx proxy_pass
[21:44:41] <anddam> thx
[21:45:00] <anddam> is there a facility in debian to run user-services, or anyway to run a service with user privileges?

[21:56:15] <velix> anddam: I've experienced bad problems with system users, since their ID is below 1000.
[21:56:28] <velix> anddam: Better create a normal user with a shell to false or nologin.
[21:57:08] <randall> velix: What problems? Most daemons run with users < 1000.
[21:58:16] <velix> randall: Mostly with container stuff (podman & docker rootless). They're using subuid etc. and this starts at 1000
[21:58:56] <velix> randall: UID under 1000 make trouble here (no entry in /etc/subuid etc.)
[21:58:59] <velix> Might be a bug?
[21:59:03] <quadrat> velix those start at 100000
[21:59:16] <velix> quadrat: yeah, but just try it ;)
[21:59:35] <quadrat> I do that on the regular
[21:59:38] <velix> quadrat: I could create a test case... maybe it's a bug.
[21:59:50] <velix> Interesting. Here it didn't work (bullseye)
[22:00:15] <quadrat> my /etc/sub{uid,gid} starts at 100000 per default
[22:00:25] <velix>  quadrat: Are your subuids create automatically or do you manually add them?
[22:00:32] <quadrat> automatically
[22:00:41] <velix> When I'm creating a system user, those never make it into /etc/subuid.
[22:00:48] <velix> Interesting. Then this might be a bullseye bug?
[22:00:50] <velix> Let me retry.
[22:01:09] <velix> I've discuessed this with a friend 2 weeks ago, he also had the problem.

[22:01:50] <quadrat> basically
[22:01:51] <sney> no, sid is unstable
[22:01:55] <sney> bullseye is testing
[22:02:06] <sney> they're close together but still separate branches

[22:02:14] <velix> ok sorry
[22:02:28] <velix> let me just try
[22:02:39] <quadrat> so my test user starts at 165536 because I have a user starting from 100000

[22:06:07] <amacater> velix: If you don't know what sid is, I'd really suggest staying away from it. Use Bullseye - testing today - will be Debian 11 soon. As soon as Bullseye is released, Sid will become massively more unstable ...
[22:06:41] <velix> amacater: I'm just mixing sid and testing all the time, while a release isn't done.
[22:06:53] <velix> amacater: I'm on Bullseye on my dev system (to test the packages)
[22:07:11] <velix> quadrat: no problem. But that's why I'm using a normal user without login.

[22:59:33] <redgloboli> hi, me again... anything i can do to debug why my route settings in the interfaces file is not getting set on reboot?  i tried also to set up sleep 5; route add, didn't get set on reboot, fulll path to route didn't work, ip route add didn't work either. it only worked if i set it on top of the interfaces file, but then my local ip isn't working anymore as the defasult route gets replaced with that route. so i need to have eth0.100 on top to have 
[22:59:33] <redgloboli> local connection working and vlan.190 as second, but it just sets nothing at all, manually setting the route works with route and ip route add. debian 8 btw. thanks to jelly for all the help a few hours ago. :)
