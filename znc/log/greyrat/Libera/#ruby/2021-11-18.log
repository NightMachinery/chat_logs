[00:45:51] <isene> nakilon: your tool?
[00:46:33] <isene> Btw; Can't find any bugs in them, even after extensive testing and everyday use. 
[00:46:45] <nakilon> isene https://github.com/Nakilon/shelenium
[00:47:41] <nakilon> the tool is intended to makes you able to test curses

[00:51:23] <ox1eef> isene: what did you use to write the curses applications? curses from stdlib, or another wrapper?
[00:52:21] <nakilon> need to figure out yet how it would work in some Github Actions environment; basically it would need 1. ensuring the extension works in headless (or add the xvfb service that would definitely make it work) 2. to have an sshd on the build agent 3. just pass the key
[00:52:22] <havenwood> curses actually isn't in stdlib anymore. it was gemified.
[00:52:39] <havenwood> https://stdgems.org/
[00:52:58] <isene> Curses from stdlib + my curses extension (https://rubygems.org/profiles/isene)
[00:53:31] <isene> Yes,  I depend on the gem
[00:54:47] <ox1eef> havenwood: great link, maybe i'm confused, there is two types of gems and both types are installed by default, only type cannot be removed (default). is it not still available without using 'gem install' in that case?
[00:55:00] <ox1eef> only one type*
[00:55:22] <nakilon> there are three kinds of gems )
[00:55:50] <ox1eef> the third being user gems?
[00:55:57] <nakilon> you can find their classification in some changelog where they get moved from one class to another
[00:58:38] <nakilon> smth like 1. bundled gems 2. default gems 3. stdlib

[01:07:18] <ox1eef> well, on neither 2.x or 3.x does "require 'curses'" work for me. it looks to be a gem living outside of the default and bundled gems.

[01:28:39] <isene> Ah, OK
[01:29:23] <isene> I needed those extensions since the standard gem is sorely lacking in features

[02:53:27] <nakilon> I have some dejavu; why doesn't Struct provide a good #values_at method that would accept the attribute names?... why does it expect the integers?...
[02:56:51] <ox1eef> I don't think that is a good API, reading the documentation gives me the impression it was done in relevance to #values, where it is an array - that would be my wild guess.
[03:02:58] <tempate> I asked before but I couldn't get it working. How can I solve a linear system of equations in ruby?
[03:03:54] <ox1eef> tempate: please paste the error you see, i assume the library works but there's a misconfiguration or understanding in relation to your ruby installation.
[03:04:46] <tempate> I don't know what library to use for starters, frankly
[03:05:16] <tempate> There doesn't appear to be a clear replacement to numpy
[03:05:39] <ox1eef> i have no suggestions for that beyond the one you were recommended earlier
[03:05:51] <nakilon> there is a built-in class matrix
[03:05:55] <nakilon> that might be useful
[03:06:59] <tempate> I couldn't install the one I was recommended earlier after trying for two hours
[03:07:13] <tempate> Could you just say which one you use?
[03:07:15] <nakilon> you didn't tell exactly how it didn't install
[03:07:24] <weaksauce> tempate post the error that you got installing it
[03:07:42] <ox1eef> I tried the gem, and indeed it doesn't look to be requirable: ../linalg/loader.rb:162:in `load_library': cannot find backend library for Numo::Linalg (RuntimeError)
[03:08:07] <tempate> Yeah, that's what I got
[03:08:58] <nakilon> maybe you need this https://github.com/ruby-numo/numo-linalg/blob/master/doc/select-backend.md
[03:08:59] <weaksauce> install instructions said install https://github.com/ruby-numo/numo-narray

[03:09:48] <ox1eef> weaksauce: numo-narray is a runtime dependency, this looks to be a failure to bind to C code.
[03:10:02] *** Quits: ged (~ged@deveiate.org) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[03:10:09] <weaksauce> yeah it binds to the C interface
[03:10:35] <weaksauce> or atlas or openblas or intel mkl
[03:10:45] <tempate> I'm surprised there isn't an easier way. Isn't there a goto library for things like this? As there's numpy in python?
[03:11:26] <ox1eef> it's not as well developed in ruby as python, as you can see from the github repository that project has under 40 stars
[03:11:43] <weaksauce> https://github.com/sciruby/sciruby
[03:12:00] <nakilon> tempate millions of students are forced to make wrapper sin pithon for you
[03:12:04] <nakilon> no one is forced to make one in ruby
[03:12:08] <nakilon> be the first 
[03:12:14] <nakilon> I force you
[03:12:16] <nakilon> _^^
[03:12:21] <weaksauce> it seems that sciruby is most akin to numpy
[03:12:30] <weaksauce> in that it bundles a ton of other gems
[03:13:15] <tempate> The only thing I really care about is solving a system of equations using gaussian elimination. I only mentioned numpy because it's the goto when you want to do anything math-related in python.
[03:13:36] <ox1eef> why did you pick ruby
[03:13:47] <tempate> because it's the language I like to code in the most
[03:14:03] <tempate> (and I didn't know I'd have to solve linear systems of equations)
[03:14:41] <ox1eef> makes sense, but not a well developed space in ruby, most people are just using what already works and is well established, and that's python.
[03:14:55] <nakilon> so "if --with-backend option is not specified, try to load mkl,openblas,atlas,lapack."
[03:15:00] <tempate> Should I just translate my code to python?
[03:15:06] <tempate> It'd be kind of sad
[03:15:09] <nakilon> that probably means you have to install either of these in your machine besides the gem
[03:15:53] <nakilon> homebrew has them
[03:16:09] <ox1eef> you could try to install the backend it is trying to load, that's the cause of the failure. if you don't have the backends already, the fix might be as easy as installing them.
[03:16:32] <tempate> Regarding the links, I don't really know what the first one is about, the second one doesn't seem to concern the problem, and I had already seen and followed the third one, arriving at my current problem
[03:17:08] <nakilon> have you installed any of the libs I quoted?
[03:17:10] <tempate> so just gem install mkl and all the others?
[03:17:21] <ox1eef> the library looks to be ruby binding's to C libraries - the C libraries are missing, and because of that the require fails.
[03:17:52] <tempate> nakilon: on it

[03:25:54] <tempate> nakilon: I didn't really know what to install so I installed the gems numo-openblas, lapack, and atlas. I still get the same error message though.
[03:26:16] <nakilon> you need a library that isn't related to ruby
[03:26:45] <nakilon> those libraries are just C/C++ stuff that may be used by either Ruby or anything else; the gem expects your machine to have them installed already
[03:29:05] <nakilon> they are the "backend libraries", not gems
[03:29:39] <tempate> oh, nice

[03:30:10] <tempate> Thanks a lot!
[03:30:37] <nakilon> pls tell us if you have a success story later with ruby -- it would inspire those who also don't want to use numpy

[21:01:08] <leah2> how come?
[21:02:25] <havenwood> I've never wished that. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
[21:02:40] <havenwood> Curious why too.
[21:02:44] <leah2> we have =begin for #if 0 ;)
[21:02:51] <leah2> and else a plain if worked or me
[21:27:27] <rapha> well, only for if 0. no other conditions :P
[21:28:25] <rapha> mostly because i like to switch back and forth between `items.each ...` and `Parallel(items).each ...` on some scripts, but am too lazy to write a method for the insides of those blocks.
[21:30:50] <leah2> def Parallel(x); x; end  # now it's disabled
[21:33:15] <rapha> oh wait
[21:33:20] <rapha> that would even keep the .each intact
[21:33:23] <rapha> sweeet idea
[21:34:41] <leah2> :)
