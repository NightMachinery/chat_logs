[01:50:16] <SeaDough> ^ China to introduce new law to punish VPN providers
[01:50:22] <jan6> same ol' song
[01:52:24] <Joanna> Hi everyone
[01:52:49] <Joanna> China doesn‚Äôt want its citizens being hijacked ?
[01:52:56] <Joanna> :)
[02:10:37] <jan6> they don't want anyone traversing the great firewall, from inside the wall
[02:12:42] <Joanna> How can they punish vpn providers in foreign countries though. Sure they can control the app stores
[02:13:21] <Joanna> Someone could still sneak in vpn app pretending to be something else maybe
[02:13:39] <jan6> the point is just that chinese people wouldn't be able to see sites the government wants to block
[02:13:57] <jan6> like winnie the pooh memes
[02:16:43] <Joanna> The government could cut off access to all foreign addresses  that aren‚Äôt on a whitelist
[02:17:10] <Joanna> I don‚Äôt see why they need to make a law about it
[02:17:49] <jan6> because they won't want to totally isolate the internet
[02:17:55] <jan6> they're a "republic" after all
[02:18:45] <Joanna> They don‚Äôt want another tianamen square people power revolution
[02:19:09] * jan6 no do politix but nods agreeably
[02:19:54] <Joanna> It‚Äôs chinese opsec :)

[02:43:15] <Joanna> jan6: I‚Äôm surprised they don‚Äôt demand government ID at those things
[02:47:16] <jan6> the most surprising thing was that 1) nobody double-checked the name and code 2) NOBODY checked his "job" 3) they had the lanyards and stuff free to grab, even before any verification or anything
[02:58:32] *** Parts: grobi (~grobi@user/grobi) ("baby i'm bored ‚ôû‚ñÄ‚ñÑ‚ñÄ‚ñÑ‚ôù‚ñÄ")
[03:20:02] <Joanna> I wonder who the official guests were supposed to be ?
[03:20:20] <Joanna> Like only people on a mailing list maybe?
[03:21:05] <Joanna> It seems like defcon maybe it was paid admission?
[03:21:29] <Joanna> It‚Äôs like a trade show basically
[03:22:30] <Joanna> Which means the people selling stuff had to pay to have booths
[03:24:38] <jan6> probably paid, and possibly also only related industry people
[03:25:17] <Joanna> I wonder how hard it was to get a paid ticket
[03:25:23] <jan6> I'd assume the ticket would simply be expensive enough that only big corps can afford to send people in, lol
[03:25:46] <Joanna> I‚Äôm sure their website would say how much tickets cost
[03:25:56] <jan6> probably
[03:26:23] <jan6> oh, not even *that* expensive or anything
[03:26:50] <jan6> exhibit hall is $75 (or $150 if you're late)
[03:27:02] <Joanna> It‚Äôs really just a trade show though so from vendors perspective they just want customers for their stuff
[03:27:11] <jan6> yeah
[03:27:22] <jan6> "person of the year" show is $100 per person
[03:28:07] <Joanna> I wonder if it had any lectures like defcon
[03:28:14] <jan6> SIA education@ISC is $75 for 2-day pass, even
[03:28:42] <jan6> which includes discounted hotel and travel rates
[03:29:12] <jan6> and given one of the selling points is "Access to Hours of Networking Opportunities & Special Events" it's definitely not that special, just a trade show, yeah
[03:29:12] <jan6> lol
[03:29:20] <Joanna> The exhibitors would probably be happy to sell to anyone
[03:29:27] <jan6> looks like it
[03:29:46] *** Quits: shibboleth (~shibbolet@user/shibboleth) (Quit: shibboleth)
[03:30:17] <jan6> still probably pretty embarrassing that a security show let people in without figuring out they weren't supposed to be there
[03:30:22] <Joanna> So he hyped it up :) I‚Äôd like to see him sneak into a bilderberg meeting :) or the White House :)
[03:31:16] <jan6> his main point was that "everyone else is sneaking into the same boring places, I'm gonna try somewhere new...say...that security conference that's nearby, in a few days!"
[03:33:23] <jan6> but it's kinda interesting how once someone gets through the first line of checking stuff, nobody EVER bothers to do a secondary round, or randomly check, unless it's ultra-important, and even then it might not happen
[03:34:58] <jan6> once you're through the check-in, you're "supposed to be here, so why bother inconveniencing anyone and re-check"
[03:35:06] <Joanna> They weren‚Äôt that worried. Have you ever worked as a security guard? Hassling each person coming in is a lot of effort
[03:35:18] <jan6> yeah, not each person
[03:36:01] *** Joins: vaio (~gary@user/ghost)
[03:37:17] <Joanna> Robert banks is a real name
[03:37:22] <jan6> yeah
[03:37:36] <jan6> although "rob banks" as a literal name would prolly be very rare
[03:37:56] <Joanna> The business he was with .. imagine having to look at a list of allowed businesses for each person
[03:38:23] <jan6> the point was they never checked the code and the person matched
[03:38:44] <jan6> which is one of the oldest tricks, lol
[03:38:49] <Joanna> They would have to spend a lot of extra money on people checking ID
[03:39:07] <Joanna> How did the QR code work ?
[03:39:19] <jan6> it was from a photo
[03:39:43] <Joanna> The objective of the event organizers is to make money
[03:39:48] <jan6> since there's a myriad of dumb people posting photos of themselves with exposed keys and tickets and other sensitive info
[03:40:23] <Joanna> Oh he copied someone else‚Äôs Badge and put in his name
[03:43:16] <Joanna> He snuck into a trade show without paying basically..

[14:18:49] <Joanna> Hey JimBuntu
[14:23:11] <Joanna> Today I was thinking of how physical development and mental development such as talking has to be accomplished in early childhood or it is lost forever.. what if people‚Äôs way of thinking when they are a child is limited only to memorizing things and following instructions. When they become an adult they will be forever stuck in that mode of thinking and will never be able to think creatively and solve complicated problems...

[16:12:41] <CalimeroTeknik> Joanna, you can lock yourself up, but there's no real limit, it's just mental resource management
[16:14:23] <CalimeroTeknik> my mental development is apparently not ended, as I changed completely how my intuition conceives what it operates on, over the course of the last two years
[16:15:08] <CalimeroTeknik> meta-cognition allows you to learn as much as how others learn, and replicate anyone else's mental operation
[16:16:36] *** Quits: inky_ (~inky@31.7.162.99) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[16:17:04] <CalimeroTeknik> also, you can be learning properties of the notional concept of problems themselves, such as that the structure of the best solutions is dependent on the complexity of the problem itself, which if anything helps being creative

[17:01:21] <iz> Joanna: there are some developmental things that kinda get set when you are younger, but most things you can learn or change at any age
[17:02:33] <iz> the one thing i can think of now that gets set when younger is your ear for language -- your brain kinda focuses in on the sounds used for language when you are younger
[17:02:55] <iz> that's why they always say it's better to learn a second language when you are younger
[17:07:25] <jan6> well, learning gets a bit slower the older you are, but yeah, technically you can learn most things at any age
[17:11:24] <jan6> for language, the main great tactic is being surrounded with that language
[17:15:31] <Joanna> Language definitely but also habits and motor skills.
[17:16:28] <Joanna> It seems that most formal schooling stresses memorization rather than thinking.
[17:18:05] *** Quits: _mobot (~mobot@95.183.53.137) (Quit: interrupt)
[17:18:29] <Joanna> Children are naturally creative but schooling often snuffs out creativity. And now with modern media it‚Äôs even worse with most people spending large portions of their lives staring at screens.
[17:18:44] *** Joins: _mobot (~mobot@95.183.53.137)
[17:21:14] <Joanna> I believe it‚Äôs often referred to right brain and left brain thinking

[17:28:52] <Joanna> When mandatory schooling was introduced in the late 19th century they had to enforce it at gunpoint but these days people just send their children off to school without a second thought. It‚Äôs been said that people were more literate in the one room school house era before the mandatory Prussian school system was introduced.
[17:31:25] <_inky> i was tortured in my soviet school because i am lefthander. (:
[17:31:53] <_inky> every soviet citizen needed to be the same, and use primaraly right hand, no knowledge even, how to write with left.
[17:31:57] <Joanna> I know someone who is left handed
[17:32:56] <Joanna> I don‚Äôt see what the problem is they don‚Äôt use inkwells anymore so
[17:39:58] <_inky> inkwells?
[17:40:23] <_inky> ah found what is that.
[17:40:40] <_inky> well my parents were very happy that very late in ussr they got the modern pen.
[17:40:58] <_inky> and when the modern pen existed in ussr, and it was even produced, still the schools enforced inkwells for some time.
[17:41:42] <_inky> and it was overhead, because one had to also think to not leave the spots of ink on the paper. and when i was a pupil in the 80ies, every notebook i got had a special separate page to absorb the spoiled ink.
[17:42:04] <_inky> something from a different paper, like a napkin.
[17:43:11] <_inky> you had to constantly put the pen in to the ink, calculate how much ink you need on it, calculate your movements to the paper, write a couple of letters or the word, then move the pen again in to the ink to get more ink.
[17:43:18] <_inky> and not leave spots.
[17:49:29] *** Joins: inky_ (~inky@5.77.254.89)
[17:52:19] <jessicara> i can imagine some day people losing the ability to write because of touch screens
[17:52:43] <jessicara> my signature has increased in mess the less i physically write myself
[17:55:00] <inky_> i hve heard that writing with the hand considered important and it is not going out of school at least for first classes.
[17:55:18] <inky_> but i think one day it won't be necessary.
[17:55:52] <jessicara> i remember those pencils with the rubbers on the end
[17:55:57] <jessicara> or, eraser to americans
[17:56:15] <jessicara> those rubbers/erasers were pretty awful and made more mess than not using them
[17:57:29] <inky_> but in ussr we didn't have those and only rarely you coud see such a pencil if someone brought it from abroad. but it was rare because most people were not permitted to go abroad.
[17:57:49] <inky_> so it was considered very cool.
[17:58:11] <jessicara> it was weirdly the opposite here, people thought it was interesting someone decided to use a pen instead
[18:01:55] <inky_> also regular erasers in ussr were only of one type, low quality, grey/blue colour.
[18:02:37] <inky_> my grandmother went to czekhoslovakia and brought a couple of erasers i was keeping till very late, being afraid to use them.
[18:02:51] <inky_> those were so beautiful, and pleasant to touch.
[18:03:05] <jessicara> yeah i remember the higher quality ones
[18:03:17] <jessicara> were near-white and nice to touch
[18:03:51] <inky_> sho broguht some red, green and yellow.
[18:03:51] <jessicara> didn't leave the page looking like a weird blue smudge where attempted to erase
[18:04:00] <inky_> i never seen something like tdat.
[18:23:49] <jan6> lol
[18:23:51] <jan6> yeah
