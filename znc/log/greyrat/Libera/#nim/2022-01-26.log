[13:33:25] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> I dont know what python star is
[13:34:42] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Unpack array into arguments

[13:34:57] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Of course, since it is Python
[13:36:17] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> it feeds arrays / seqs as parameters to a func as far as I can tell
[13:36:23] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> I mean hmm the example you seen before is cause Nim presently doesnt allow you to inject parameters from inside a call
[13:38:35] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> it wouldn work even if we restrict the seq and parameters to the same type?
[13:43:17] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> `doThing(... a)` or similar needs compiler support

[13:45:13] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> üò©
[13:45:19] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> The issue is the compiler does "Hey this is a call, let's look at the parameters"
[13:45:26] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> The parameters presently have to be comma seperated expressions
[13:46:09] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> There are hacks that'd be easy to enable unpacking like allowing `doThing((a; b; c;))` but it's clearly a hack

[22:50:35] <NimEventer> New post on r/nim by Ready_Photograph_279: chvancooten/NimPackt-v1: Nim-based assembly packer and shellcode loader for opsec &amp;amp; profit, see https://reddit.com/r/nim/comments/sddxa0/chvancootennimpacktv1_nimbased_assembly_packer/
[23:02:01] <arkanoid> can I do something like "for atype in [int16,int32,int64]" without convoluted macro?
[23:05:45] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> you might try to do it with `(int16, int32, int64)` maybe
[23:05:55] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> certainly not with array, it must have the same type for each element
[23:06:11] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> `std/typetraits` might have some tuple iterators that you might find useful
[23:08:00] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> hmm, there is 1k USD bounty for interfaces in nim now https://github.com/nim-lang/RFCs/issues/39#issuecomment-1018706344
[23:08:06] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> (edit) "hmm," => "nice,"

[23:11:35] <FromDiscord> <eyecon> I scanned it but didn't immediately see what an interface as described does better than a concept, does anyone know?
[23:11:36] <arkanoid> interfaces in nim? Interesting, but what kind of interfaces? OOP like, or FP like?
[23:22:04] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> I think specific details can be discussed along the way, but probably more OOP/go etc.?
[23:26:34] <FromDiscord> <Phil> I'm currently making a tiny package out of my minimal db connection pool thingy‚Üµ... Do I just compile libraries with nim c to see if it runs and make it so that compiling also runs the test suite?
