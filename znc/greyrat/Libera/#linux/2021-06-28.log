[00:11:20] <Libre1209> is there something like grep, how do you do redirection?
[00:12:04] <Libre1209> I thought windows and dos had 'more' but can't figure out how to use it, a normal pipe doesn't work
[00:12:05] <Sauvin> Redirection is about the same, but as far as I can remember, there's no grep-like command in DOS.
[00:12:06] <DPA> akik: fstab.d isn't supported by any distro. It was removed from gnu mount, but support for directories in general was never removed from libmount. So, on devuan, I created a symlink /etc/fstab to /etc/fstab.d/, that tricks libmount and everything else to work as if it was still supported.

[04:17:51] <mattf> how can i find out what is  causing some "freezes" glitches idk how to phrase it. Everything freezes for a little time sometimes and if it is while i am typping it repeats characters then. Sometimes it doesn't happen for a day then on the next it comes back. I am on arch linux, qtile twm, picom compositor
[04:18:04] <mattf> it happens during videos sometimes.. so annoying
[04:18:39] <mattf> i suspect can be something causing a cpu peak for a very little moment. Is there something that can graphs and saves the history of cpu usage of all processes?
[04:18:59] <mattf> i couldn't ever catch what it was
[04:19:07] <mattf> is not picom
[04:19:20] <mattf> idk if some sort of combination of various things could be causing this
[04:19:31] <Sauvin> mattf, "i don't know", not "idk", please. It might be heavy CPU usage, or it might be IO saturation.
[04:19:54] <mattf> IO as in disk?
[04:20:01] <Sauvin> Normally, yes.
[04:20:28] <Sauvin> Anything that goes through the IO pipes. Sometimes it might be network IO, but when it happens to me, it's usually disk IO.
[04:20:36] <Sauvin> Is your keyboard wireless?
[04:20:37] <Bashing-om> mattf: Running ' journalctl -f ' (follow mode) in another terminal might be helpful.
[04:20:39] <mattf> no
[04:20:49] <mattf> my keyboard is wired
[04:21:06] <mattf> but look. Im watching a video and sometimes it haas these freezes too
[04:21:08] <mattf> oh it just hapened
[04:21:20] <mattf> this "haas" i only hit on a once

[04:53:51] <Wafficus> matsaman hmm well
[04:53:57] <Wafficus> I used to use that drive as an old git drive
[04:54:00] <Wafficus> super low profile
[04:54:09] <Wafficus> I just manually deleted all the git repos from that drive anyway
[04:54:16] <Wafficus> and reformatted it to ext4 with that command
[04:54:21] <Wafficus> didn't know if I'm just good to go for now though
[04:55:15] <matsaman> Wafficus: the chances anybody will attempt data recovery on it are low
[04:55:21] <Wafficus> since I used 'mkfs', do I still need to use fdisk though?
[04:55:25] <matsaman> the more it is used, the more the remaining data will _actually_ be overwritten
[04:55:28] <Wafficus> yeah I'm not concerned, it was super low profile
[04:55:56] <Wafficus> didn't know if I should repartition the drive to compensate for the fact that I used maybe like 50 gigs of the 1 TB drive anyway
[04:56:00] <matsaman> if you have sdc1 and it's ext4, you're probably all set for a typical ext4 partition
[04:56:07] <Wafficus> gotcha, coolski
[04:56:14] <Wafficus> thanks matsaman :)
[04:56:15] <matsaman> 50 gigs of the 1 TB?
[04:56:26] <Wafficus> yeah it was just for a Git repo backup drive
[04:56:35] <Wafficus> I'm a bit overkill for backup drives
[04:56:44] <matsaman> no such thing =)
[04:57:01] <Wafficus> plus you can't really even find drives that are less than 1 TB too often, especially in the external department
[04:57:12] <Wafficus> however I learned my lesson to not depend upon 2 drives hooked up to a Raspberry Pi
[04:57:21] <Wafficus> I shifted over to a file server instead
[04:57:42] <fling> How to forward desktop notifications from remote X apps?

[04:58:25] <JanC> you can find external SSD/flash drives that are less than 1 TB for sure  :)
[04:58:26] <Dagmar> Do the things.
[04:58:48] <matsaman> Wafficus: what happened with the two drives?
[04:58:56] <dylan_> fling: there is a push notif app, KDE Connect
[04:59:07] <Wafficus> matsaman lets just say there's not enough external power on a Pi to power them both most of the time

[04:59:16] <matsaman> I think 2 drives hooked up to an SBC is fine, _but_ you still need a remote backup also
[04:59:23] <matsaman> Wafficus: oh they were usb power only?
[04:59:28] <Wafficus> but under high pressure like high downloads, one would just shut itself off
[04:59:33] <matsaman> yeah that wouldn't surprise me if it didn't work
[04:59:35] <Wafficus> yep exactly matsaman
[04:59:43] <Dagmar> Yeah insufficient power is murder
[04:59:51] <matsaman> we used a couple dedicated-power external USB drives on an rpi in a closet for years, no issues
[04:59:51] <Wafficus> it worked, but yeah not great for consistent work
[05:00:07] <Wafficus> I'm into data hoarding a bit, so it only made sense to move up to an Optiplex
[05:00:13] <matsaman> but again, you definitely need one more remote drive for _actual_ redundancy anyway
[05:00:16] <Wafficus> probably my power bill went up but who cares, love it anyway

[05:02:18] <Wafficus> but after talking to a few people online
[05:02:26] <Wafficus> like its only recommended like ONE external HDD like that per Pi

[05:02:32] <Wafficus> past that, its just gonna be a bad time
[05:03:17] <Dagmar> Wafficus: Yeah a little digging and youc an find out what the Pi itself draws under high load and subtract that from what the power supply you're using is rated for, and then laugh because the remainder is nowhere near 1a

[13:48:03] <loganlee> i meant \;
[13:49:03] <curdlesnoot> well the backslash is just to prevent your shell from interpreting a semicolon. the two forms are "-exec command {} ;" and "-exec command {} +". the difference is that the latter feeds "command" with as many arguments as it can in one pass, which is a lot more efficient for something like chmod.
[13:50:06] <curdlesnoot> keeping in mind that there is a cost to forking and executing "command" that could otherwise add up.
[13:50:29] <loganlee> many arguments as it can in one pass?
[13:50:48] <curdlesnoot> there's no hard answer, but you can be assured that it will never exceed the limitations imposed by ARG_MAX.
[13:51:13] <curdlesnoot> after all, the exact answer would depend on the length of the arguments in question, the condition of your environment and several other things.
[13:51:34] <curdlesnoot> don't worry, it's high in practice.

[14:11:42] <DrEeevil> rsync resumes by default
[14:11:48] <HyP3r> Ohhhkay
[14:12:18] <DrEeevil> most of the time you don't need to do anything, running it repeatedly /should/ converge to a stable state where nothing changes in the target anymore
[14:12:36] <HyP3r> Ok
[14:12:49] <HyP3r> Actually I run it with "rsync --update --verbose --archive --progress /share/CACHEDEV1_DATA /share/external/DEV3301_1/CACHEDEV1_DATA"
[14:13:06] <HyP3r> I don't want to retransfer already transferred files

[14:14:15] <HyP3r> Ok
[14:14:35] <Kyv> it transfers the difference, hence why it behaves as DrEeevil explained.

[15:05:59] <curdlesnoot> again, arguments beginning with a hyphen denote options. the fact that ->get_entries is single-quotes is immaterial because the shell removes those before executing grep.
[15:06:02] <bobdobbs> That's interesting, cos I'm just not getting errors
[15:06:17] <bobdobbs> hmmm
[15:06:55] <curdlesnoot> so, it does begin with - as far as grep is concerned.
[15:07:02] <bobdobbs> So how does one grep for a pattern that contains a hypen?
[15:07:12] <locsmif> curdlesnoot: so I guess my intent is to have a cron job which does *not* immediately run after a time difference is detected, but *only* at the time it is expected to run. But the man page is just a bit short on information imho

[15:10:09] <bobdobbs> heh
[15:10:20] <curdlesnoot> bobdobbs: so, in zsh, it treated ->get_entries as a form of output redirection. that would never happen in posix sh or bash. that's why there was no error.

[15:37:32] <curdlesnoot> loganlee: let me try to reduce that to something digestible: if you want to expose a site at "my-public-ip", why not listen on said IP in the first place rather than just 127.0.0.1?
[15:38:01] <curdlesnoot> reverse proxies have their uses but it's not obvious from the post why you think you need one.
[15:38:02] <loganlee> curdlesnoot: it is rewriting the public ip to localhost. that is the reverse proxy

[16:53:25] <geirha> if you don't supply a port on that http url, it will use port 80 by default, not 8000
[16:54:11] <loganlee> i know... $GD_IP/ecommerce/api/* gets rewritten to localhost:8000/api/* by htaccess
[16:54:34] <curdlesnoot> yes. presumably the request was then fielded by apache, which then proxied to 127.0.0.1:8000. if you want to know what owns :8000, use ss again.

[16:57:29] <curdlesnoot> ok, but you should use -p, really. it will be instructive.
[16:58:08] <loganlee> what is 'Peer Address:Port'?
[16:58:51] <loganlee> for port 8000 it is *:* and for port 3000 it is 0.0.0.0:*
[16:59:03] <curdlesnoot> the address:port of the theoretical peer that might connect to you. for a listening service, that's an unknown. any peer could theoretically connect to your host. so it's shown as *:8.
[16:59:05] *** Joins: jkwnki (~jkwnki@p4fedb101.dip0.t-ipconnect.de)
[17:00:26] <curdlesnoot> as for * vs 0.0.0.0, the implication - I believe - is that * could handle both IPv4 and IPv6 whereas 0.0.0.0 would handle only IPv4. but it's a bit more nuanced than that (read up on the net.ipv6.bindv6only sysctl if you want to go down that rabbit hole).
[17:00:49] <curdlesnoot> anyway, the point is that the request was fielded by apache bound listening on port 80 in one test case, but _not_ in the other.
[17:00:54] <curdlesnoot> in the other case, you connected directly to node.
[17:01:30] <loganlee> to be honest i'm confused
[17:01:47] <curdlesnoot> ask yourself who owns port 80.
[17:02:34] <curdlesnoot> then consider that all HTTP URIs that don't specify a port number imply :80 by default
[17:02:46] <curdlesnoot> in the other case, you tested http://$GD_IP:3000 which is quite specific.
[17:02:58] <loganlee> can i step back and tell you what happened? i was expecting http://$GD_IP/ecommerce/app to open the app but it opens when i visit http://$GD_IP:3000.

[18:34:58] <kfrench> Then that defeats the primary goal of a distro like CentOS or Rocky.
[18:34:58] <Dagmar> Asking folks to take what was targeted as a _stable_ platform and replace it with a rolling release was just beyond mad
[18:35:40] <Dagmar> The purpose was always to have a stable platform, not to just scribble over "RHEL" with another name
[18:36:00] <kfrench> Once you decide to not be as close as possible to RHEL, you might as well switch to another distro - something else that has a long lifecycle.
[18:36:06] <Dagmar> Hardly
[18:36:34] <Dagmar> Let's take that AD integration as an example
[18:36:39] <Dagmar> It's kind of a s**tshow
[18:36:56] <Dagmar> ...but once you beat the crazy out of it, it's at least _your_ s**tshow and it works.
[18:37:08] <Dagmar> But RHEL _keeps dorking with it_
[18:37:25] <kfrench> Has CentOS chosen to undork it?

[19:07:54] <node1> Then?
[19:08:01] <Dagmar> NTPd is _always_ querying remote clocks to get a consensus about the time
[19:08:35] <Dagmar> It then compares that against what teh system clock is doing and under normal circumstances updates the figure that the kernel uses to try and keep the system clock accurate

[20:24:55] <Dagmar> That's somewhat problematic when the only thing separating you from space is perhaps some tinfoil and less metal than is in a Toyota Tercel
[20:25:00] <BCMM> basically, if *anything* hits a satellite at orbital velocity, it's game over
[20:25:04] <koollman> Dagmar: much less likely to be hit by a small sphere than the equivalent material split into tiny spheres
[20:25:18] <BCMM> doesn't matter if it's a tiny screw or a whole other satellite
[20:25:23] <Dagmar> koollman: Until the lot is actually magnetized
[20:25:25] <koollman> and the chances of tracking/avoiding increase if the sphere gets bigger
[20:25:45] <koollman> Dagmar: that is unlikely to matter much. Pretty weak force
[20:25:45] <peetaur> it is or isn't depending on things... if it's spread, there is no place that is perfectly safe...but if it's in one clump, that one space is way less safe even to heavily armored hulls. If that change puts you over the limit of the strength of your hull, then it's a relevant change.

[20:26:23] <koollman> autopsy: it is. But only if you can plan the trajectory long enough before the problem happens

[20:26:56] <Dagmar> yes, in space there's far less friction to dampen the effects of the "weak force"

[23:32:59] <ntwk> I've been sometimes working in Dosbox, although as I understand it, it doesn't really strive to be a full reimplementation of DOS.
[23:33:28] <ntwk> I remember coming across some unimplemented stuff.
[23:34:04] <curdlesnoot> it's not particularly accurate either. dosbox-x is a bit better.
[23:34:05] <ntwk> It's all about making old games work.

[23:54:32] <RedNifre> Is there a simple way to copy a directory into itself, but with a denylist of what not to copy?
[23:54:48] *** Quits: ctest94 (~ctest94@2409:4073:219c:f932:6d83:aaf:c341:3ec0) (Quit: Client closed)
[23:55:07] <rob`> RedNifre: rsync -a --exclude maybe
[23:55:17] <RedNifre> Say I have a directory that contains a build directory and I want to copy the directory into the build directory, excluding the build directory and some other files.
[23:55:18] <koollman> RedNifre: hm. so, remove a bunch of stuff ?
[23:55:37] <koollman> yeah, rsync could do that
[23:55:42] *** Joins: gabriele (~gabriele@user/gabriele)
[23:55:47] <RedNifre> Well, the problem with removing after copying might be that you get an infinite copy loop if you copy a directory into itself?
[23:56:13] <koollman> rsync -a --exclude=build/ --exclude=otherdir/ ./ build/
[23:56:24] *** Joins: orbatos_ (~orbatos@user/orbatos)
[23:56:27] <koollman> copy everything but build and otherdir into build
[23:56:43] <RedNifre> Okay, I'll look into rsync then. Is it guaranteed to be already installed on most distros, or should I add installing it to the build instructions?
[23:56:50] <RedNifre> thanks, I'll try that.
[23:57:01] <curdlesnoot> it isn't, no. better to specify it as a requirement, if in doubt.
[23:57:20] <rob`> yeah, it'll 99% likely be available from your package repo tho
[23:57:27] <rob`> apt install rsync or whatever
[23:57:36] <akik> RedNifre: and remember rsync behaves differently if you have a leading / in the source dir or not
[23:57:42] *** Joins: torus (uid489343@user/tusko)
[23:58:00] <akik> oops not leading, the opposite
[23:58:01] *** Quits: gabriele (~gabriele@user/gabriele) (Client Quit)
[23:58:04] <koollman> not leading, but as a suffix :)
[23:58:06] <akik> trailing
[23:58:21] <koollman> (which is why it is specified in my example)

[23:58:30] <torus> I am running a Tor daemon locally and it is listening on port 9050, but for some reason when I point my irc client to it at 127.0.0.1:9050 it fails to see it
[23:59:11] <RedNifre> Well, I guess I exclude a file as --exclude=otherfile then? Or does that look for a directory in a differently behaving way?
[23:59:43] <akik> RedNifre: you don't need it for --exclude
