[02:15:29] <megamus_prime> TheSHADOW, thanks. I had actually seen that already but seeing as that spec was from 2017, and for some reason firefox was reporting the site's certificate i thought it could be outdated or something
[02:16:38] <TheSHADOW> It is, sort of, but this new spec someone came out with hasn't been published, and I don't think any open-source versions are available.
[02:17:16] <TheSHADOW> I don't think there's been any BEPs submitted lately at all, much less been turned down.

[12:29:28] <The_8472> ah, I missed the question
[13:52:04] <megamus_prime> It should be enough to get cracking then. Thank you TheSHADOW!
[14:00:47] <The_8472> just in case it's not mentioned, bittorrent.org contains more than just the original bittorrent spec. https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0000.html
[15:39:20] <megamus_prime> The_8472, so besides the base spec, there are standards for certain features if i'm reading it correctly?
[16:26:53] <The_8472> yes, and a new version of the base protocol in BEP 52
[16:27:29] <The_8472> some BEPs are very widely adopted. alas, the categorization of active/accepted/draft does not reflect that well
