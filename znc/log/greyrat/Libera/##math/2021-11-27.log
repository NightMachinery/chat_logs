[00:00:09] <cherim> Yes, that's the (0,1) part (where irrational plays the role of 0) in "and you give R-related usual examples of (0,1) - not closed, and [0, inf) -- unbounded" with any fully covered coordinate in R^N with product topology making the second example like unbounded
[00:00:31] <Z-module> no, but it's open in  Q cap [0,1]
[00:00:50] <cherim> So any unification isekaijin wants should answer the simpler "how to unify closed and bounded requirements in R^n"
[00:01:10] <greenbagels> ah, Q cap [0,1], gotcha

[00:02:18] <cherim> Or maybe the original setting is already dropped, it's not easy to follow how the focus shifts
[00:02:29] <isekaijin> I was hoping that there could be a single explanation of how Q and R^N fail to be locally compact.
[00:04:02] <XCode> Hi. Let us say we have $D_i \subset \mathbb{P}^4$. We have the Segre embedding $\mathbb{P}^4 \times \mathbb{P}^4 \rightarrow \mathbb{P}^{24}$. Assume that $deg(D_i) = n_i$ in $\mathbb{P}^4$. What is the degree of $D_1 \times D_2$ in $\mathbb{P}^{24}$?
[00:04:28] <Z-module> greenbagels: a more fun-but-indirect way is to use the fabulous theorem that every countably infinite metric space without isolated points, such as  Q cap [0,1],  is homeomorhic to Q.  So neither of those is compact because Q has an unbounded metric, the usual one.

[00:05:37] <isekaijin> If we take an open ball B \subset R^n, we have this nice property that compact subsets K \subset B are far from the boundary \partial B.

So some n in N exists with the projection  pi_n(U) = all of R, so also  pi_n(K) = R.   But this isn't possible since pi_n is continuous and R is not compact.

[04:32:22] <buster> d3x0r, since you're looking at parallel transport you might enjoy this for a few seconds (it's useless: better to make yourself a cone out of paper, but it was interesting to implement) <https://buster.me.uk/globe/>

[04:36:35] <buster> not too hard, the red part-circle on the flattened out cone has the same arc length as the circle of latitude, and the cone is tangent to the sphere, which relates the radius of the flattened-out cone to the hypotenuse of a triangle in space

[04:38:23] <d3x0r> my parallel transport thing is 3d; but it starts with a super small curvature so you have to zoom in to see it, and it's hard to know what you're supposed to be seeing; it's a hole thing.  I barely even mention it though I'm thiking of recording a video to go along with it.  It goes up to excessive curvatures too; since the translations k is just a scalar on the angles to sin/cos

[06:20:06] <Guest145> x and y are < 12
[06:20:15] <ppw> what exactly is the question

[06:22:42] <cherim> You can just solve directly, without even assuming x and y are integer
[06:23:17] <Guest145> if x is even, then x = {2,4,6,8,10} and y = {1,3,5,7,9,11} and since sqrt(xy) is an integeer i could study both sets
[06:23:24] <Guest145> But there must be an easier way
[06:23:37] <ppw> tried squaring the left equation?
[06:24:13] <Guest145> you mean the first equation?
[06:24:18] <ppw> yes
[06:24:32] <Guest145> Nop, but i shouldnt do that
[06:24:36] <Guest145> I have to solve it by inspection
[06:25:22] <Guest145> The book gives as hint: if x or y is even the it has to be 0 or 4 since x and y are perfect squares
[06:25:26] <Guest145> but i dont see the relation
[06:25:48] <Plazma> one must simply assume all integrals will converge

[06:30:30] <cherim> x^2+y^2+2xy = (x+y)^2 = (7+sqrt(xy))^2 from the first equation, and subtracting the second you have xy=49+xy+14sqrt(xy) - 133, so xy=36, and from the first equation x+y=13. So x and y are roots of z^2-13z+36=0, i.e. x=4 y=9 or x=9 y=4.

[09:29:13] <nagefire> Guest80: On a personal level, I've had to simplify sums over 4 indices with an inner portion of 4 variables
[09:29:32] <nagefire> Guest80: No one will publish a paper that has 20 steps of algebraic simplification so that the formula fits on one line
[09:29:45] <nagefire> Guest80: Pardon, I meant to say 20 pages
[09:30:06] <savask> (Coq people will fill in these 20 pages in the future, if your result is important enough)
[09:30:07] <mycroftiv> guest80: do you realize that many theorems of modern mathematics are fully computer formalized in multiple proof assistants?
[09:30:22] <nagefire> Guest80: My personal notebook has one particular optimization problem of three variables that I spent months solving by hand
[09:30:46] <nagefire> Guest80: The result was obvious from the beginning, but the proof non-trivial. We made it into a remark "We observe ..."
[09:30:48] <Guest80> nagefire: thats fine and expected and pragmatic. all I'm saying is, it's naive to think this practice has no effect on the consistency of maths as a whole, when a simple thought experiment reveals scenarios where this isn't the case and there are clearly trade-offs to make writing proofs more practical
[09:30:54] <mycroftiv> so if you are claiming some kind of large scale problem in the practice of mathematics relative to computer science, i dont think is well supported by evidence, in fact we find as we formalize more and more and more math in different foundations, it is all consistent
[09:30:58] <Guest80> that sacrifice some consistency
[09:31:15] <Guest80> and leads to large flaws in the reasoning as these small inconsistencies accumulate over time
[09:31:17] <Guest80> over centuries
[09:31:32] <nagefire> An the point of formalizing mathematics is that we remove those inconsistencies over time
[09:31:57] <nagefire> Otherwise fields like computer science would never develop sufficiently to be useful
[09:32:12] <mycroftiv> guest80: so do some actual work and show that a claimed publish theorem is wrong by formalizing its definitions and demonstrating the problem. people do this work, and generally find the published theorems are correct.
[09:32:37] <Guest80> mycroftiv: the problem is you have to consider MULTIPLE THEOREMS simultaneously
[09:32:53] <Guest80> it's not enough to consider one theorem. one theorem is unlikely to have these errors they're cumulative
[09:32:56] <Guest80> over centuries
[09:32:57] <mycroftiv> guest80: you are talking nonsense, I can load many theorems simultaneously into a computer proof assistant
[09:33:22] <nagefire> Guest80 then help formalize math and find the inconsistencies. That's the job of a good mathematician
[09:33:23] <Guest80> mycroftiv: the size of the program I'm talking about if written in COQ could not be stored on a standard computer
[09:33:38] <Guest80> the sheer storage capacity required would be far far larger than a few GB or TB
[09:33:47] <nagefire> So we're talking about micro inconsistencies on a scale that's impossible to comprehend and you're complaining?
[09:33:55] <mycroftiv> hes talking literal nonsense
[09:34:11] <ssst> How do I show that Pr(a | b) = Pr(a) given Pr(b) = 1 without using independence? I have Pr(a | b) = Pr(a ∧ b) / Pr(b) = Pr(a ∧ b), but I don't know how to proceed from here

[09:34:45] <nagefire> I think that it's amazing that math is that sound in the first place
[09:35:05] <isekaijin> I am pretty sure that, at least at the level that is taught at the undergraduate and masters levels (or at least the material that I was taught at these levels), everything is safe from inconsistencies.
[09:35:10] <savask> Guest80: Do you mean there are some very subtle problems which will end up in a contradiction if you consider enough theorems?
[09:35:27] <Guest80> savask: yes
[09:35:55] <savask> That's unlikely in my opinion, but at least I see your point
[09:36:01] <Guest80> that would be one way to show what I'm talking about in a concrete way
[09:36:06] <Guest80> you could do it in Coq
[09:36:23] <Guest80> but would likely require storing more than a few TB of theorems to find said inconsistencies
[09:36:58] <nagefire> And then you fix them
[09:37:12] <Guest80> nagefire: how do you fix them if you cant find them to begin with?
[09:37:28] <nagefire> I'm saying that once you find them, you fix them
[09:37:28] <Guest80> there's nobody acknowledging this right now
[09:38:23] <nagefire> No one claims that math is completely sound or perfect
[09:39:00] <nagefire> If it's sound enough that it's humanly impossible to find inconsistencies, then it's the most perfect system we can devise
[09:39:02] <Me-me> Many people claim that all the time.
[09:39:12] <Me-me> Math enthusiasts.
[09:39:24] <Guest80> ^
[09:39:26] <nagefire> That's the difference between an enthusiast and a professional, I suppose
[09:39:29] <Guest80> exactly my point Me-me
[09:39:52] <mycroftiv> actually logicians worry about inconsistencies in the foundations of mathematics and study the problem in detail
[09:40:06] <Guest80> give me a couple million dollars and I'll build a system written in Coq that could find these micro inconsistencies. without such a system, we have to accept that maths is imperfect
[09:40:30] <isekaijin> wtf is a “micro-inconsistency”
[09:40:38] <Guest80> mycroftiv: im not even talking about logic
[09:40:42] <isekaijin> A system is either inconsistent or it is not.
[09:40:44] <Guest80> that's another topic
[09:40:45] <mycroftiv> guest80: you are the wrong person to get the million dollars, but funding for projects to formalize more math and search for issues definitely deserve it
[09:40:47] <nagefire> Guest80 you would introduce your own inconsistencies trying to find those inconsistencies
[09:41:07] <Guest80> mycroftiv: yea but theyd just be stealing my idea
[09:41:13] <isekaijin> It is inconsistent if you can find a proposition P, and a proof of P, and a proof of \neg P.
[09:41:17] <nagefire> This was never your idea
[09:41:22] <isekaijin> And it is not inconsistent if there is no such triple.
[09:41:26] <mycroftiv> guest80: the fact that you talk about inconsistency in math and then say 'im not even talking about logic' shows you are deeply ignorant of the topics you are making speeches about

[10:01:35] <nagefire> That state diagram
[10:02:42] <nagefire> I don't know enough about algebra or formal logic to even understand what this says
[10:03:02] <mycroftiv> the laver tables are amazing, they are derived from the elementary embeddings of very strong large cardinal axioms
[10:03:13] <mycroftiv> but they are finite arithmetical structures
[10:04:14] <riv> yes they are
[10:04:33] <mycroftiv> so right now, we have a prediction about how these finite arithmetical structures behave which depends for its proof on the consistency of this very powerful axiom of a rank-into-rank cardinal
[10:05:39] <mycroftiv> it seems like there SHOULD be a proof of this fact (if its even true!) from a less strong axiomatic system because in general we think that arithmetic shouldnt need large cardinals except in weird corner cases with Gödel encodings, but some people like Harvey Friedman think differently
[10:06:13] <riv> it seems reasonable to me
[10:06:55] <mycroftiv> that there is an inherent need for a strong axiom with algebraic consequences to get this result?
[10:07:01] <riv> yes
[10:08:30] <mycroftiv> id like that myself, philosophically, that once we make the axioms of infinity strong enough, we see algebraic consequences in our understanding of arithmetical structure

[12:44:47] <johnkeats6> it's not that surprising once you realize topology reduces to algebra, and algebra reduces to pushing symbols around which is also what looking for proofs in a formal system is
[12:44:52] <d3x0r> sorta feels like I should read more on string theory (and I only say that here cause noone lives in physics :( )
[12:45:11] <d3x0r> the lines sorta go in, squiggle aorund the closed space a whlie and come back out
[12:45:39] <mycroftiv> this is one way set theory independence results serve the needs of ordinary mathematics - if what you are trying to prove/disprove is equivalent to proving continuum hypothesis or existence of a measurable cardinal, you know you will never prove it or find a counterexample from base zf/c

[17:28:11] <Z-module> greenbagels: your "the general theorem is for *any* group whose order is pq, and p doesnt divide q-1; not just direct products of cyclic groups" earlier is slightly odd, since when p < q are primes and p doesn't divide q - 1, as in cadmio's exercise, it *has* to be =~ a direct product of cyclic groups. I guess your point was that it wasn't outwardly given literally C_q x C_q ?

[21:33:23] <isekaijin> My guess would be the following. Let H be the subgroup of G generated by {-1, 2, 3, 5, 7}. Since H is Abelian and finite, it can be written as F/F', where F is a free Abelian group of finite rank, and F' is a subgroup of F (necessarily again free Abelian of finite rank). Find an expression F/F' where F' is as small as possible.

[21:35:49] <isekaijin> Errr, a basis of F', since it is free.
[21:38:56] <tomtomgps> Ok, my prof apparentlyt sent an email to the class saying « a basis or relztions is the minimal system of generators (of the relation groupe =. a module of ZZ) »  The relation group is the kernel of the homomorphim ZZ^n -> ZZ/NZZ^* that sends (e_1,…..e_n) to p_1^e_1 …  p_n^e_n. where p_1,…. p_n {-1, 2, 3, 5, 7} so n = 6
[21:39:37] <tomtomgps> I’m not sure what is meant by ZZ, is that a typo ?
[21:40:28] <johnkeats7> some people write ZZ to mean blackboard Z = integers
[21:40:30] <Z-module> It's what some people use to to ascii-simulate {\bbf Z}. So it's just the set Z of integers.

[21:55:41] <mycroftiv> i think we have this confirmed 'experimentally' because people deliberately make sure all the foundational systems can prove the theorems we want about the naturals and the reals and basic geometric and graph constructions
[21:56:16] <mycroftiv> if your foundation proves that triangles have 8 sides and there are less reals than natural numbers, you are in trouble
[21:56:58] <isekaijin> The one thing that is nice about CT and TT is that they rely less on encodings. And, when they do rely on encodings, at least the encodings are more “natural”. You can make more uniform choices “across the whole universe”, rather than the super ad hoc choices “on a per set basis” that set theory forces you to make.

[22:00:18] <mycroftiv> i wouldnt really recommend it, its more of a 'if you are interested in the general topic, heres what some of the content looks like'
[22:00:40] <isekaijin> Another thing that CT (no idea about TT) has going for it is that it makes it easier to work with spaces that are awkward when regarded primarily as sets of points.
[22:01:01] <isekaijin> For example, the fiber product of schemes is defined by a universal property.
[22:01:18] <isekaijin> And the underlying set of the product is not necessarily the Cartesian product of the underlying sets of the factors.
[22:01:42] <isekaijin> So saying that everything is “a set plus...” is really missing the point.

[22:01:51] <Panther> That looks promising.
[22:02:36] <isekaijin> But type theorists do not seem terribly interested in serving the needs of normal math.
[22:02:59] <mycroftiv> well the origins of type theory are tied up with constructivist philosophy of math
[22:03:19] <Panther> Then they belong to that type of mathematician, assuming we want to classify those.

[23:42:40] <Everything> more inputs for outputs = surjection? more outputs for inputs = injection? Right?
[23:42:50] <B11529> no\

[23:45:36] <B11529> these questions are all ill-posed
[23:45:58] <riv> Everything: ...
[23:46:01] *** Joins: pavonia (~user@user/siracusa)
[23:46:02] <Everything> there are injective/surjective functions. modulo division is a function. why ill-posed?
[23:46:06] <riv> remember when i said f : X -> Y twice
[23:46:26] <B11529> Everything: provide a domain, a codomain, and a rule, before asking if it's surjective.
[23:46:38] <Everything> domain/codomain is N: [0..inf]
[23:46:42] <Everything> [0..inf)
[23:47:14] <B11529> and what is the rule of "modulo division"
[23:47:39] <Everything> B11529: same as in Wikipedia
[23:49:29] <Everything> a \equiv b \pmod(12345) where a,b \in [0..inf) - is this function injective or surjective?
[23:49:40] <B11529> that's not a function
[23:49:52] <[itchyjunk]> I think i should be 1/R^2, don't see why it would be 2
[23:50:15] <Everything> B11529: you'll soon asking me for a 'rule' for a function? For 'numbers'?
[23:50:34] <B11529> Everything: very little of what you've asked has been well posed
[23:50:47] <B11529> it's hard to answer because the questions make little sense
[23:51:12] <Everything> B11529: do you really know the stuff you're talking about?
[23:51:15] <[itchyjunk]> wait, he even says 1/R^2 so where is that 2 comming from?

[23:53:04] <Z-module> Presumably Everything means something like the map Z -> {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}  using reduction mod 7, for example.
[23:54:00] <greenbagels> is BCT required to show that the rationals can't be g-delta in R?
[23:55:15] <cherim> 2/R^2 is "for sufficiently large R" in Borcherds' Cauchy
[23:55:56] <Z-module> greenbagels: I think so
[23:56:46] <cherim> After division by z^4 and factoring out 1/R^2 he gets (1+O(1/R^2))/(1+O(1/R)) which has limit 1 as R->inf, which does not imply it is eventually <=1 but certainly implies it's eventually <=2
[23:57:27] <cherim> Proof of "Q is not G-delta in R" differs from stating Baire only insignificantly
[23:57:48] *** Quits: gucci (~i.am@user/marlboro) (Quit: I come down here for a fat woman and that's what I'm havin.)
[23:57:58] <Z-module> greenbagels: I guess there could be other routes. There are no complete countably infinite metric spaces without isolated points, right? That would do it then, along with the topology theorem that a given subset Y of a complete metric space X has a compatible complete metric iff Y is a G_delta in X.
[23:59:54] <greenbagels> baire is equivalent to a weak form of choice, right? or am i misremembering
