[00:30:16] <cbreak> nightstrike: stashing should be easy
[00:30:30] <cbreak> but you can also just use git commit --fixup HEAD~ to commit an amend-commit
[00:30:49] <cbreak> and then later git rebase -i --autosquash, when you're done committing everything
[00:30:52] <ikke> except if you want to change the commit message
[00:35:10] <imMute> then use --squash instead of --fixup ;)

[07:36:32] <elibrokeit> cryptonector: as documented by man git push -- it cannot infer what you expect new-branch-name to be, if HEAD doesn't unambiguously resolve to a ref beginning with refs/heads/ or refs/tags/ and new-branch-name doesn't exist on the remote
[07:36:32] <gitinfo> cryptonector: the git-push manpage is available at https://gitirc.eu/git-push.html

[07:37:32] <elibrokeit> however, if HEAD is a branch, even if that branch is, say, master, you can push HEAD:new-branch-name and it can successfully determine that you mean to push a branch, so it treats new-branch-name as a branch

[07:53:26] <dayday> Hi! Curious about some basic workflow stuff here. I got this repo that only I use (commandline), so instead of committing new features and fixes incrementally like I would if I was working with a team, I just rebase back and forth between my main commits like "Add Feature A", "Add Feature B" etc.
[07:53:26] <dayday> Unfortunately I often run into merge conflicts (duh), and sometimes I get sloppy and miss a spot, causing commits to contain code that isn't theirs. So I have to rebase, re-rebase etc. -- it always works out in the end but it's extremely time-consuming, and I have without doubt spent more time on my Git history than on my project itself :-)
[07:53:26] <dayday> Are there any ways to simplify this workflow? Maybe some UI tool I managed to miss out on?
[07:55:40] <elibrokeit> dayday: what does that even mean "rebase back and forth between my main commits"?
[07:57:30] <dayday> Say I want to fix something in commit "Add Feature A", then I just rebase back to that commit and apply the fix there and amend the commit. As opposed to making an entirely new commit ie. "Fix this or that in Feature A". Hope that made sense!

[07:58:21] <elibrokeit> ah, so basically the same as if you did git commit --fixup=feature-A-commit
[07:58:44] <dayday> Really???
[07:58:53] <elibrokeit> but you're asking if there is advice on simplifying the process of autosquashing the commits together
[07:58:54] <dayday> Oh man :-)
[07:59:26] <elibrokeit> git commit --fixup creates a new commit with a magic oneline description beginning with "fixup!"
[07:59:57] <elibrokeit> and that tells git rebase -i --autosquash how to automatically sort and mark the commits for squash/fixup
[08:00:38] <elibrokeit> actually resolving conflicts is still going to be a challenge, sadly :(

[08:01:20] <elibrokeit> however -- you do not need to keep going back and forth to amend old commits, you can commit stuff piece by piece and then glue it back together after the fact
[08:01:49] <elibrokeit> e.g. typically I don't want to checkout an old commit just so I can work on fixing it up
[08:02:19] <elibrokeit> I fix it on the latest commit, commit --fixup, and immediately rebase --autosquash to fold it into the commit it belongs in

[08:08:09] <elibrokeit> it is pretty handy :) especially since it means you can now use git add -p to add only part of the current set of edits to an old commit

[08:25:40] <elibrokeit> as PR branches
[08:26:08] <cryptonector> right, me too
[08:26:11] <elibrokeit> elsewhere I might just use one branch called "patchqueue" and send patches via git send-email
[08:27:11] <cryptonector> for example, if I'm rebasing an OpenJDK branch onto a newer OpenJDK, then I'll get into detached head state, git rebase --onto, and when I'm gone fixing conflicts I'll create a branch and push it
[08:27:40] <cryptonector> it's just, I might want to push to a new remote branch and not keep a local one
[08:27:49] <cryptonector> so, ok, you taught me something
[08:29:16] <elibrokeit> I wouldn't be opposed to git adding an option to always assume if it cannot figure out what you are trying to push, assume it is a branch. But it's not really up to me...
[08:29:32] <cryptonector> I'd like that; anyways, gtg, thanks

[10:48:20] <Assault> hi. I already made some commits to develop branch (but did not push the commits to remote). Now realised I should have created a new branch for the commits. Is it possible to somehow move the commits to new branch at this point?

[10:57:41] <rudi_s> Assault: Sure, just create a new branch with `git branch new-branch` and then "remove" the commits from the old branch with git reset --hard origin/develop or similar. NOTE: The --hard will remove uncommitted changes in your working tree. So only do this if `git status` shows no pending changes.
[10:58:39] <miikak> Assault: I have done it as follows: reset with --soft flag, checkout new branch and commit changes there

[12:01:51] <Guest1> so what happened is i was on my feature/skeletons branch, realized i didn't want to keep the work there, and tried to revert back to the previous commit, so i ran that reset command, then checkout'd master, and then checkout'd feature/skeletons again

[12:11:47] <Guest1> `git reset --hard [cccccc]`
[12:11:52] <makara> here's a puzzle. I kept a branch locally that was already committed to master because I needed to see the list of unique commits it made
[12:11:56] <makara> That was a while ago. Today I rebased the branch with master by accident, but without changing to it first. So the reflog doesn't show the commit it was on before rebasing. How do I find that commit?
[12:12:08] <Guest1> and do i run that command while in master or in feature/skeletons?

[17:05:40] <Anticom> Hi folks. When having a submodule and I'm updating its ref, is there any (convenient) way to view the log for the range of that ref update? (Similar to how `git commit -v` will display those changes)

[17:06:34] <osse> Anticom: git diff --submodule=log  perhaps?
[17:06:56] <Anticom> cousteau: IMHO a good start would be to learn more about the internals of git. You wouldn't have to keep all this knowledge on hand every time but it's good to have read about it. E.g. https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/git-internals-objects-branches-create-repo/
[17:06:59] <cousteau> (maybe I should learn git lsf...)
[17:07:38] <cousteau> Hm, might do that.  I think I have a pretty solid idea of how git internals work, but let me check

[17:15:58] <Anticom> Also it's been a while since I've last devoted myself wih learning about internals... maybe I should do another one of those sessions as well
[17:16:03] <cousteau> So basically you wouldn't need to know what the parents of a commit are in order to get the files in the commit.  That would be very inefficient!  Whenever you change to another branch you'd have to apply all the diffs one after the other
[17:16:13] <osse> Anticom: git diff will usually print the old and new shas, so you can do  cd submodule; git log old..new
[17:17:02] <Anticom> osse: that works of course, was just curious since `git commit -v` is giving me a nice list of commits for the submodule I thought maybe there's another way to get this info without having to jump into the commit msg editor :D
[17:17:05] <cousteau> So it instead saves snapshots of the whole tree, and uses diff between commits only for certain operations, like merge, rebase, cherry-pick...

[17:53:55] <jensen> Oh yea, I basically follow the approach here: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles. On my desktop machines, I have ~/.dotfiles.git. I was setting up for my server that's hosting the repo to copy the same setup. I guess cloning $HOME/repos/dotfiles.git to ~/.dotfiles.git isn't necessary and I can just use the actual repo since it's just a bare repo
[17:54:47] *** Quits: Vonter (~Vonter@user/vonter) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[17:55:12] <jensen> One thing I'm still not sure about is how to manage my server dotfiles. Following the approach linked to manage my desktop machines is straightforward because most config files are shared by them and the contents are mostly the same. For the server, I want it to track only a few files already tracked from my desktop machines
[17:55:24] *** Joins: Vonter (~Vonter@user/vonter)
[17:56:30] <imMute> jensen: I have my dotfiles repo cloned to ~/.dots/ on every machine.  then I have folders in there that are per-machine (some symlinked to others where I want to share everything between hosts) and a script to setup symlinks in ~ pointing into that ~/.dots/ tree.
[17:56:32] <jensen> So I'm thinking of creating a branch for the server from master, do an initially cleaning up of removing all irrelevant files (git rm) and then only cherrypick commits from master here and tehere
[17:57:23] <imMute> jensen: I think using branches for different machines is overkill.  since to share things (like the script that sets up my command prompt) I'd have to merge, but only merge certain files - some files shouldn't ever be merged.  using plain folders is easier (for me) to keep track of

[22:09:47] <ghosteau> Following a tree analogy, I would guess merging down merges "towards the trunk", and merging up mergers "towards a branch".  The terminology probably comes from another SCM, as you suggested
[22:09:49] <longshanks> ghosteau: i think it's always better to be explicit about which branch or branches you're merging into which. I do think of merge *into* and rebase *onto* as it helps with the visualisation but up and down. yikes!
[22:10:22] <longshanks> maybe see-saw scm.
[22:10:56] <ghosteau> The thing is that in git there's no trunk and branches, it's all separate branches, so it doesn't make as much sense
[22:12:02] <ghosteau> But there's often a main/master/stable branch that just sits there waiting for PRs, and multiple development branches that implement the experimental features

[22:18:34] <ghosteau> Apparently it was the other way around.  When you create a new branch for some fix, you draw it below the master or "parent" branch. So merging down is merging from master to the development branch, or "syncing with master", and merging up is merging the devel branch back into master
[22:18:41] <ikke> "Plastic SCM is a full version control stack designed for branching and merging. It offers speed, visualization, and flexibility."

[22:35:09] <xsx> yeah, that's what i thought, but was hoping there is a hidden way in git to get ot ;)
[22:35:22] <ikke> Create a script that iterates over each tag, keeps track of the current major version, and print the tag if the major version changes, and store the new major version
[22:35:44] <ghosteau> git tag v[0-9]* | sort | uniq with some parameters so that it only reads up to the first .
[22:36:31] <ghosteau> git doesn't care much about version numbers.  I mean each project uses a different version numbering scheme
[22:36:37] *** Quits: computeiro (~Wender@189.37.67.180) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[22:36:59] <ghosteau> Oh but if these are version tags they're probably annotated tags, so maybe print only those
[22:37:44] *** Quits: longshanks (~longshank@user/sml) (Quit: leaving)
[22:39:17] <ghosteau> Actually I'm not sure `git tag v[0-9]*` works
[22:40:17] <xsx> they are not annotated :( yeah,i will go with awk, sort and other stuff
[22:40:39] <xsx> ghosteau: you ommited -l arg
[22:42:19] <ghosteau> Yeah I did.
[22:42:35] <ghosteau> Not sure if it's needed if you use a pattern though?
[22:42:58] <ghosteau> Or maybe that only works without arguments

[22:49:09] <ghosteau> git tag --list 'v[0-9]*' | sort -n | uniq -w3   will work as long as the major version has no more than 2 digits (and is followed by a . if it has only 1 digit)
[22:50:00] <ghosteau> Because if the tag is "v1.2.3" it'll only compare the first 3 chars, i.e. "v1."

[22:50:27] <ghosteau> And if it's "v10.0.1" it'll compare the "v10"
[22:51:16] <ghosteau> This is a rather poor solution, but it may work for you if all you want is a quick comparison.  For a more advanced one you'll want a proper scripting language.
[22:52:17] *** bin is now known as bintober
[22:52:29] <ghosteau> git tag --list 'v[0-9]*' will print all tags that begin with "v" followed by a digit
[22:53:21] <ghosteau> (you can go one step further and do things like 'v[0-9]*.*.*' or whatever)
[22:53:32] <xsx> ghosteau: what is the -w for uniq? i don't have this option
[22:54:03] <ghosteau> sort -n will sort numerically (10 goes between 9 and 11)
[22:54:21] <ghosteau> And uniq -w3 will only check the first 3 chars
[22:55:21] <ghosteau> xsx: what platform are you in?
