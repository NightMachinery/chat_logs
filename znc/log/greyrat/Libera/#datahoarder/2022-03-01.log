[00:29:08] <xMopx> if you modify the image file you'll have to write it to the drive all over again to ensure there's no corruption skye0 
[00:29:54] <skye0> ah, OK. so i'll have to run it uninterrupted towards the weekend or so
[00:30:42] <skye0> not sure if i have a spare 40 hours. i might but i can't be as productive as i want to be with my data hoarding if most of my weekend will be taken up from that
[00:31:05] <xMopx> why do you have to write stuff to an image file and then the image file to a drive?
[00:32:23] <skye0> they're OS backups. doing so before i install my new graphics card in case of fuckups
[00:32:58] <xMopx> i mean, as opposed to mounting your drive and copying the stuff normally?
[00:35:51] <skye0> been recommended to write .img files (by rawktucc i think?) instead of my previous method of choice, running backups via gparted - i felt gparted was faster but it's a bit less streamlined
[00:36:17] <rawktucc> what was your original source and backup process again?
[00:36:41] <rawktucc> if you're using gparted, you could just use dd
[00:37:19] <skye0> for entire operating systems, copy the partitions from one drive to the other individually
[00:37:27] <rawktucc> gparted is fine for that
[00:37:30] <rawktucc> or clonezilla
[00:37:33] <rawktucc> or dd 
[00:37:41] <skye0> i am currently using dd but without gparted, just from the terminal
[00:37:46] <skye0> and writing to an img file
[00:37:58] <rawktucc> yeah that's fine
[00:38:03] <rawktucc> i did that recently
[00:38:09] <rawktucc> you could use ddrescue as well if the drive is dying
[00:38:18] <skye0> writing to an img file saves me from having to mess around with partitions but i feel it's slower. i'll have to check next time maybe, idk
[00:38:32] <skye0> and my sleep's fucked. earlier on i was feeling sleepy but now i'm more awake
[00:38:36] <xMopx> and then you store multiple .imgs on some backup volume or write the img to a backup volume directly?
[00:39:15] <skye0> xMpox i think i store them on a backup volume
[00:40:21] <xMopx> so like, if i mount your backup volume on my computer, i would see a bunch of .img files?
[00:40:27] <xMopx> or a clone of the ssd
[00:41:17] <unfinity> ・゜゜・。。 ​ ・゜゜\_0​< QU​ACK!
[00:41:24] <xMopx> ,bang
[00:41:24] <unfinity> xMopx you shot a duck in 6.340 seconds! You have killed 2 ducks in #datahoarder.
[00:42:58] <xMopx> let's goo https://i.imgur.com/MK9MeZH.png
[00:43:08] <skye0> xMopx a bunch of .img files. i would restore them manually if i needed to
[00:43:23] <xMopx> got it
[00:44:12] <xMopx> do you compress them? Could get it done faster 
[00:44:42] <xMopx> seems like the bottleneck would probably be the write speed on the 2.5 hdd
[00:45:06] <skye0> i don't compress them
[00:45:08] <skye0> ,get https://www.scan.co.uk/products/4tb-wd-my-passport-wdbpkj0040bbk-wesn-portable-external-hdd-usb-32-gen1-bus-powered-black
[00:45:10] <unfinity> WD My Passport 4TB External Portable Hard Drive/HDD - Black LN102657 - WDBPKJ0040BBK-WESN | SCAN UK
[00:45:20] <skye0> this is the HDD i bought. there is potentially a bottleneck because of the spinning rust
[00:45:28] <skye0> ,get https://askubuntu.com/questions/523037/how-would-i-speed-up-a-full-disk-dd
[00:45:28] <unfinity> partitioning - How would I speed up a full disk dd? - Ask Ubuntu
[00:46:05] <skye0> i'm pretty sure usb 3.0 is capable of quite fast speeds, but i feel like HDDs seem to be capped at either 150 MB/s or 50 MB/s
[00:46:40] <xMopx> yeah, where the ssd you can probably read from at 100s of MB/s
[00:47:14] <xMopx> you could do something like `dd if=/dev/sda | gzip > /backup/volume/test.img.gz
[00:47:27] <skye0> i needed storage for cheap and i don't think i have a spare free 2tb SSD (or even 4tb one)
[00:47:36] <xMopx> since only the gzipped data is written it should be faster
[00:47:39] <skye0> i can try that
[00:48:00] <skye0> although i do expect only marginal improvements considering that one of the partitions is like 1tb
[00:48:01] <xMopx> it's probably possible to mount your plain .img files but the compressed ones not so. That's the caveat 
[00:48:16] <skye0> i'd have to uncompress them first i believe before restoring them
[00:48:27] <xMopx> you could do it on the fly with a similar dd command
[00:49:01] <xMopx> also, `pigz` instead of gzip is nice because it's still gzip format but can use all your CPU cores to compress faster :)
[00:49:33] <skye0> pigz?
[00:49:57] <xMopx> it's just another tool, same idea and format as gzip, but a faster implementation 
[00:50:58] <xMopx> https://zlib.net/pigz/
[00:52:48] <skye0> am using a flash drive (that isn't at all persistent with software installation) to do the whole OS backups in one go, although i could always install on both the debian and ubuntu partitions i have and do the backups separately
[00:55:18] <skye0> so i wonder if you have any further advice, i might consider at least installing pigz and creating those compressed images but i don't expect significant time savings
[00:55:51] <xMopx> yeah you should be able to install it with a live cd or live usb, uses a bit of memory 
[00:56:36] <xMopx> one other idea, if this is a linux pc - use LVM to manage your SSD and take a snapshot as a backup 
[00:56:42] <skye0> depends on the distro that my live USB uses, some aren't designed with software persistence in mind
[00:56:44] <sarnold> snapshots aren't backups
[00:56:49] <xMopx> you can DD the snapshot somewhere from your live system
[00:56:51] <sarnold> snapshots can't help you recover from fire or flood
[00:56:56] <sarnold> there we go
[00:57:06] <xMopx> using your current install, and without worrying about it being modified by your system
[00:57:13] <xMopx> too early on the trigger sarnold :P
[00:57:38] <sarnold> whoever wrote my shell script did a poor job ;)
[00:57:41] <xMopx> caveat is you lose a bit of disk space because LVM needs scratch space (and you probably have to reinstall your OS)
[00:57:44] <xMopx> Lol

[01:04:24] <NeoThermic> TIL, chrome remote desktop creates a proper display context
[01:04:49] <NeoThermic> so if you have a 3D app that has a hWind to that context, and you disconnect, it really hates you.
[01:13:43] <skye0> sarnold what would be? copying the entire partitions?
[01:15:28] <sarnold> skye0: xMopx's "copy the snapshot somewhere else" works well if you've got tooling around it; a lot of people use zfs snapshots and tools like syncoid, znapzend, or their own hand-rolled things, to copy snapshots to another machine
[01:16:41] <skye0> i haven't set up zfs yet and i don't have any other free machines. i'm creating this to restore to the same machine if anything messes up somehow once i upgrade the graphics card
