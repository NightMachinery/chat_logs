When I execute aws confrigure sso, it will ask for a region, once I start typing a letter like "u", it will bring a dropdown menu beside the letter "u" I typed. The menu shows 3 choices, us-east-1,
[01:34:24] <zumba_addict> 2 and do on. I'd like to code something like that. How did they do it?

[02:08:16] <twkm> nq -c echo foo >> bar.txt
[02:08:45] <quidnunc> twkm: But that redirects the output of nq, not echo, right?
[02:08:49] <twkm> so what do you want?  (beside me magically knowing what nq does)
[02:09:37] <twkm> that's what i wrote, yes nq's output.  echo is just an argument to nq.
[02:09:53] <quidnunc> twkm: nq is a simple job queue. So you do "nq bigcompile-step1; nq bigcompile-step2;" and it will process them in order
[02:10:30] <quidnunc> twkm: So what I want is to capture the output of bigcompile-step1 (and step2)
[02:11:12] <quidnunc> twkm: I'm just confused how this handled, because I can do something like 'watch "mycommand | grep -i trigger-word"'
[02:11:19] <twkm> at a guess you want to invoke a shell that then invokes stepN with redirection or piping.
[02:12:03] <twkm> a'la, nq -c "bash -c 'step1 >> log'"
[02:12:24] <quidnunc> twkm: So I can probably do it by putting everything in a separate shell script, but I'm trying to figure out if there's a better way

[08:19:45] <kurahaupo> emanuele6: The issue with BASHPID changing is because in reality every command that's not a built-in gets its own transient subshell, between the fork() and the execve(). It's not normally visible, but clearly in this case the order of redirection then fork has been switched, probably to fix a bug involving blocking the parent when opening a fifo or slow device.

[09:23:09] <shbot> hejux: /dev/sd[a-z]
[09:23:29] <hejux> what bash is this?
[09:23:46] <e36freak> # echo $BASH_VERSION
[09:23:47] <shbot> e36freak: 5.1.8(1)-release
[09:24:02] <e36freak> but it's irrelevant, all bashes are gonna do that when the glob doesn't match anything
[09:24:07] <e36freak> 00:51 < e36freak> you may be interested in nullglob
[09:24:28] <hejux> i see. if non is found, it just echo the /dev/sd[a-z]
[09:24:42] <hejux> so, i still need a [[ -b ]] test
[09:24:49] <e36freak> ...or nullglob
[09:24:52] <e36freak> as i've mentioned twice
[09:25:14] <hejux> yes. like shopt + and then shopt -?
[09:25:16] <yitz> hejux: a nullglob will help there
[09:25:27] <yitz> shopt -s nullglob
[09:25:30] <e36freak> or just leave it on for the whole script
[09:25:39] <yitz> e36freak: 4th time's the charm :)
[09:26:24] <hejux> why is this not enabled by default
[09:26:31] <hejux> this is very useful actually
[09:26:46] <hejux> save a lot of test
[09:26:48] <e36freak> non-nullglob is POSIX behavior
[09:27:21] <e36freak> also less likely to bite people in the ass when they don't quote properly
[09:27:41] <e36freak> # var='foo[bar]'; echo $var
[09:27:41] <shbot> e36freak: foo[bar]
[09:27:48] <e36freak> # shopt -s nullglob; var='foo[bar]'; echo $var
[09:27:48] <shbot> e36freak: no output
[09:28:22] <hejux> very informative! thanks!

[09:31:46] <hejux> for i in /dev/sd[a-z]  VS for i in /dev/sd{a..z}
[09:32:24] <hejux> looks like same thing?
[09:32:32] <e36freak> no
[09:32:39] <hejux> but behave differently. i can't tell why
[09:32:49] <e36freak> brace expansion doesn't care about files existing or anything else
[09:32:55] <e36freak> it just expands to all possible combinations
[09:33:01] <e36freak> # echo {a..z}
[09:33:02] <shbot> e36freak: a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
[09:33:18] <e36freak> a glob matches filenames and expands to any that match
[09:33:21] <e36freak> entirely different things
[09:33:37] <e36freak> also happen at different stages in the parsing
[09:33:39] <hejux> right: brace expansion doesn't care about files existing or anything else
[09:33:43] <hejux> this explains

[13:24:06] <r319n> Soliton it scp zip as jenkins user so I wanna chown it to oracle and then mv zip to oracle home and later on as oracle user (thats why sudo su - oracle) extract, alter parameters and execute scripts
[13:24:58] <Soliton> sudo su - oracle  will start a new process and once that process terminates the rest of the script will continue.
[13:25:20] <Soliton> not even mentioning that sudo su is non-sense to begin with...
[13:26:10] <Soliton> i would suggest to write a normal script, copy it to the remote and run it.
[13:29:02] <r319n> gotcha, btw, sudo chown and sudo mv doesnt work cause heredoc should be quoted or?
[13:30:21] <Soliton> the here-doc should be quoted to avoid all the shell injection. doesn't have anything to do with sudo.
[13:31:07] <r319n> then I still don't get why sudo chown doesn't work, after script is ran I still see adf_deployer.zip as jenkins:jenkins in stead of oracle:oinstall

[21:43:02] <Celmor[m]> so far I've gotten `awk -F / -v RS="\0" '{for (i=2; i<NF; i++) printf $i " "; print $NF}'`, only need to get the  delimiter added back in
[21:43:03] <llua> bash(1)
[21:43:03] <emanuele6> Celmor[m]: so why don't you use bash?

[21:43:07] <greycat> hejux: Yes.
[21:43:21] <greycat> (both of those AND the bash manual)
[21:43:29] <greycat> (each layer refers to the layer below it)
[21:43:37] <earendel> Celmor[m]: what are you doing here.
[21:43:38] <Celmor[m]> emanuele6: it would still be several commands/longer pipeline to get the job done. trying to simplify
[21:44:02] *** Joins: MaterazziSan (~user@24.135.203.113.dynamic.jazztel.es)
[21:44:17] <hejux> greycat: bash supports all man 3 printf formats?
[21:44:23] <emanuele6> you said you want to do: while IFS=/ read -rd "" _ f; do dirname "$f"; done but with uniqness
[21:44:46] <greycat> Not all.  Most.
[21:44:59] <greycat> There are a few that make no sense, like pointers.  Bash doesn't have 'em.
[21:45:32] <hejux> b e f g q ok?
[21:45:42] <ormaaj2> hejux: no. e.g. printf %p would be nonsense.
[21:45:51] <emanuele6> why not just: cmd | { a=(); while IFS=/ read -rd '' _ f; do (( a[\$f]++ )) && continue; dirname -- "$f"; done ;}
[21:45:58] <Celmor[m]> earendel:  I used to do this: `find . -printf "%T@/%p\0" | sort -zrn | while IFS=/ read -rd "" _ f; do dirname "$f"; done | uniq -d | while read -r dir; do printf %s\\n "$dir"; done` but it has an error, as dirs still get through duplicated which is why I went with the awk solution from above and am still trying to replace that loop
[21:46:01] <emanuele6> i don't see why you can't do that
[21:46:32] <hejux> ormaaj2: lol void
[21:46:35] *** Joins: trekkie1701c (~trekkie17@user/trekkie1701c)
[21:46:39] <emanuele6> anyway, if you think that you must use -vRS='\0', you should invoke awk as gawk, because that is a gawk extension
[21:46:51] <earendel> can sort be used on a particular field? i guess no. or it would have been suggested the days.
[21:46:57] <greycat> !sort-k
[21:46:57] <greybot> To sort(1) on the second field: sort -k 2,2; This means "the sort key is field 2 only". sort -k 2 means "the sort key runs from the start of field 2 to the end of the line".
[21:47:08] <earendel> oh.
[21:47:30] *** Joins: nvmd (~nvmd@user/nvmd)
[21:48:24] <earendel> here you go. that would work for you too Celmor. you just need to enumerate your entries. (give them an id) then sort (field based) -u flag (uniq) and then sort back using the ids.
[21:48:42] <earendel> thanks greykitten.
[21:48:58] <Celmor[m]> the issue with awk that remained was merely printed all except the first and last fields and leave the delimiter in
[21:49:11] <earendel> awk is an issue.
[21:49:50] <Celmor[m]> the timestamp would essentially be an id

[22:18:43] <Celmor[m]> greycat: the plan was indeed to avoid the forking of an additional process for the dirname part via awk
[22:19:33] <Celmor[m]> only haven't gotten the `!s[$0]++` part functioning with my awk line yet
[22:19:33] <ormaaj> ha
[22:19:41] <emanuele6> GNU find can print dirnames directly and you don't seem to need the full path in your pipeline
[22:20:02] <Celmor[m]> trying something like this atm: gawk -F / -v RS="\0" -v OFS=/ '{l=""; for (l=$2; i=3; i<NF; i++) l=l"/"$i; !s[l]++}'
[22:21:38] <emanuele6> that is not syntactically valid code
[22:21:49] <Celmor[m]> so essentially just having the associative array logic instead of a print: gawk -F / -v RS="\0" -v OFS=/ '{l=$2; for (i=3; i<NF; i++) l=l"/"$i; print l}'
[22:22:23] <emanuele6> why OFS?
[22:23:43] <Celmor[m]> from some SO answer that I tried, guess I don't need it anymore
[22:23:57] <Celmor[m]> when I tried concatenating the fields with the delimiter back together
[22:24:26] <Celmor[m]> !uniq
[22:24:26] <greybot> is a utility for removing or reporting repeated lines. uniq will only work for showing unique lines when used with sorted input (sort | uniq). Alternatively, use sort -u. awk '!s[$0]++' is an order-insensitive alternative.
[22:24:42] <Celmor[m]> dang, thought there was an explanation for the awk example
[22:26:14] <ormaaj2> there's a dedicated awk channel too.

[23:42:13] <emanuele6> ormaaj2: -ls always evaluated to true

[23:43:06] <shbot> emanuele6: 12
[23:43:24] <ormaaj2> which means it implicitly ends the expression IIRC so you need -o
[23:43:38] <greycat> I have no idea what you're trying to show us.

[23:44:45] <emanuele6> -ls just prints the current file "in the format of `ls -dils'" followed by a newline and evaluates to true
[23:45:11] *** Quits: ormaaj2 (~ormaaj2@user/ormaaj) (Quit: Client closed)
[23:45:24] <emanuele6> it does not implicitly end the expression and since it evaluates to true what is after `-o' is never run

[23:46:54] <emanuele6> i don't think you can pass ls options to -ls, it is just to print `ls -l' style lines

[23:52:49] <ormaaj> posix doesn't even seem to discuss the thing i'm talking about :/
[23:53:20] <greycat> -ls is a GNUism, so that wouldn't be it...
[23:54:08] <ormaaj> not related to -ls. the treatment of truth value.
[23:54:10] <greycat> the only things I can think of that you *might* be thinking of are -prune, or the funny business about an omitted -print vs. a supplied -print
[23:54:52] <ormaaj> oh that's specific to -prune?
[23:55:08] <greycat> no, -prune is just weird as hell all on its own
[23:55:33] <ormaaj> hm.
[23:56:24] <emanuele6> ormaaj: -prune evaluates to true for directory and evaluates to false for directories
[23:56:30] <emanuele6> err
[23:56:45] <emanuele6> ...and evaluates to false for non-directories
[23:56:57] <greycat> -prune    The  primary  shall  always  evaluate as true; ...
[23:57:05] <emanuele6> oh, oops
[23:57:14] <emanuele6> you are right, i misread
[23:58:05] <emanuele6> ah, right
