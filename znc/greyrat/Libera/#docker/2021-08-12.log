[00:14:02] <ska> tabakhase: finished is when the docker contaner is brought down by docker compose.
[00:15:22] <tabakhase> ska as in "finished cause its just  one job and no restart policy" - or were talking "docker-compose down"  --- for the first there is nothing, for the second not rly either, "bind-mounts" are never touched - if you use volumes instead tho, "docker-compose down -v" will rip them out too
[00:17:28] <tabakhase> only thing that _might_ actually destroy itself is a) running that with "rm: true" (rarely used in compose, but totally a thing there too) and b) volumes of type tmpfs (where at that point, you can kinda just skip the volume entirely and get the same result)
[00:18:30] <tabakhase> maybe extend on the "why" / "what for" to stir up some alternative ideas...
[00:20:32] <Activ8> Alex8 just a thought, whatâ€™s in your routers DNS? Is that set as your ISP?
[00:20:44] <Activ8> why not set the router to cloudflare?
[00:21:13] <alexeightsix> yeah i could change it on the host but i want to avoid that if possible for reusuability 
[00:21:14] <Activ8> the containers should be going to the router first n then to the external dns
[00:21:56] <alexeightsix> changing the DNS on our cloud containers is not as straight forward as modifying the /etc/resolve.conf there's specific things we need to do and i want to avoid it and offload it to docker if possible

[00:40:13] <ada_> yes that should be correct
[00:40:57] <alexeightsix> i added it and the containers seem to be working but how can i verify that it's going through CF?
[00:41:07] <ada_> tcpdump
[00:41:15] <ada_> or watch the docker daemon logs, iirc
[00:41:28] <ada_> i think it shows forwarded DNS requests on the debug log level
[00:42:27] <alexeightsix> ok i got tcpdump installed
[00:43:40] <ada_> tcpdump -i eth0 udp port 53
[00:43:58] <ada_> then send something like `dig google.com` from inside the container
[00:44:08] <alexeightsix> would curl work?
[00:44:24] <ada_> yes and no, i mean yes it would work, but curl also sends http
[00:44:35] <ada_> since you're filtering for udp you'll still see a packet

[00:52:51] <alexeightsix> this is what i followed: https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-define-dns-in-docker-containers/
[00:53:01] <alexeightsix> maybe it was specific to a different case i dunno
[00:53:23] <ada_> network_mode: bridge
[00:53:30] <alexeightsix> as you can see from the code snip it says to add dns: 1.1.1.1 .... then adds     network_mode: "bridge"
[00:53:35] <ada_> yeah thats the default
[00:53:41] <alexeightsix> which breaks everything
[00:54:32] <ada_> it actually prevents compose from creating a user-defined network for you
[00:54:34] <ada_> not really what you want
[00:55:35] <ada_> if you had multiple containers specified in your compose file, and you put that  option on one of them, that one service would get put into thel egacy 'bridge' network which wouldn't be the same as your other containers; that may explain why they didn't resolve
[00:55:44] <ada_> only containers on the same docker network may resolve each other

[03:12:58] <hwrd> tabakhase ah, to answer that question, it's just where https://zmk.dev expects files. In this case, nice60 and lily58 are pre-configured... and included, so to override the settings, I need to put it in `config/`... and non-preconfigured ones go in their own directory, with a bunch of other files.
[03:13:06] <hwrd> It's just an unfortunate setup that I have to deal with here.
[03:13:22] <hwrd> although, that separate images is a GREAT idea.
[03:14:28] <hwrd> I can do a multi-stage build and just make an image per thing I need.
[03:14:30] <hwrd> I think
[03:15:15] <tabakhase> multistage is "expected" to only return the final (you can stop "sooner" but not jump)
[03:16:08] <hwrd> maybe I'm misunderstanding multi-stage then. Your initial idea of building multiple images is a good one.
[03:16:36] <hwrd> how would I base a (for example) nice60 image off of a base image?
[03:16:58] <hwrd> locally. I'm not planning to push these images anywhere.
[03:18:20] <tabakhase> "multistage" = one dockerfile with multiple FROMÂ´s in it, think FROM c++ as stage1, RUN compile thing, FROM debian, COPY thing.bin --from=stage1
[03:19:12] <hwrd> so that wouldn't actually result in multiple images.
[03:19:46] <tabakhase> yes, and no - the "stage1" would never actually be put out, just used internally and trashed right after
[03:20:07] <hwrd> got it
[03:20:23] <tabakhase> so "docker build -t mine" with that dockerfile would return 'mine' beeing ONLY a debian with the .bin in it
[03:20:29] <hwrd> so I'd want to use something like +INCLUDE if I wanted to make a separate image output for each thing
[03:20:42] <hwrd> INCLUDE+ rather
[03:20:43] <tabakhase> youd just have multiple dockerfiles (and if you dont ever intend to "build images but bindmount instead" just a single image may be fine too, with then the "-vÂ´s as you need em"

[03:26:07] <tabakhase> (--board "$BOARD" makes it smell as if you select one of those, if it needs all cause say, "it builds the FW for all devices" thats a loss still yes)
[03:27:17] <tabakhase> then some dirty `-v $PWD/boards/nice60/:/root/config.d/nice/ -v $PWD/boards/lily58/:/root/config.d/lily/` and adding a script as ENTRYPOINT that moves those files around is likely the best fix...
[03:27:56] <dman777> I can't get the REACT_APP_ENVIRONMENT value into the app
[03:28:12] <hwrd> tabakhase yeah that's probably the nicest way... just conditionally mount the volumes based on $BOARD...
[03:29:15] <hwrd> but I mean, my original problem was a nitpick right? Having to `COPY` a few files anytime a file has changed... is kind of a MINOR MINOR optimization to begin with.

[03:31:52] <tabakhase> may be trick? -- and youre doing a multistage, so that has to be under the FROM where you want em in, so after line 28
[03:33:32] <tabakhase> hwrd kinda, kinda not - bit different usecases - namely, if youre not actually "interested in the resulting docker image, why even make it a build?" so if you can get away with "run only" thats a perfectly fine thing todo

[03:55:28] <hwrd> yeah it's because `west build` also generates output.
[03:56:14] <hwrd> I liked the idea of piping it out becase this artifact isn't really meant to be long-lived, so putting it in a named volume seemed excess
[03:56:15] <tabakhase> dman777 got a updated paste or so? - cause going from https://dpaste.org/1fFA the "RUN env" in line 25 would should show it, but in line 29 it would be gone - so did ya move that arround into the image where it should actually land?
[03:57:35] <tabakhase> hwrd no named volumes in any of this, just bind-mounts ((aka volumes whos names start with a "/*" :D)) - with volumes you would need extra "docker cpÂ´s" after to pull it out, so thats mehw sure
[03:58:03] <dman777> tabakhase: oh... I see Step 6/14 : ENV REACT_APP_ENVIRONMENT=${REACT_APP_ENVIRONMENT} but with RUN ENV I see REACT_APP_ENVIRONMENT=
[03:58:05] <hwrd> yeah...
[03:58:23] <hwrd> i gotta run. I'm gonna think about what the best way to do this is.
[03:58:27] <hwrd> I appreciate all the help tabakhase 
[03:58:42] <tabakhase> youre welcome =) laters
[03:59:41] <tabakhase> dman777 did you pull the ARG line down too? or just ENV :P
[04:05:10] <dman777> I  pulled the ARG out
[04:05:21] <dman777> and the ENV
[04:05:49] <tabakhase> maybe throw an updated nopaste :/
[04:11:45] <dman777> tabakhase: ah... I think I found another way. Thank you though :)

[05:20:04] <tabakhase> dman777 yep it should, try "docker run --env REACT_APP_ENVIRONMENT='foobar'  -p 5000:80 --rm foobar env"  ((added "env" as command overwrite on the end, nothing else changed))

[05:21:36] <tabakhase> and inside nginx that should also still be set --- so i guess, Q is more where/what error you see where? / what you would expect? --- cause "nginx" just hands out files from disk... 
[05:22:23] <dman777> oh...it's a react app so it gets built and it looks for process.env.REACT_APP_ENVIRONMENT but right now it just shows as white space
[05:22:45] <dman777> I mean it shows as undefined
[05:23:21] <tabakhase> "process.env" is a nodeJS thing, nginx gives no f* about that

[05:23:59] <tabakhase> (as in, nginx doesnt run js, just hands it down to the browser as is)
[05:24:18] <dman777> tabakhase: in the Docker file what would I put as the equal value? ENV REACT_APP_ENVIRONMENT=

[05:28:09] <dman777> maybe, I am really bad with helm

[07:32:58] <tabakhase> niklauzg dont think there is any written name for this... i call it "run-only" (cause you dont build an actual image as result) or "using docker as runtime", maybe some mix of the two with in-place could make sense too... dunno

[21:56:10] <rmaw> hello, can anyone tell me with docker-compose how I can get containers to start in order. I have a repo I want to checkout, build then share between two containers, but as I can't have a volume when building, I have to do this as part of one of the containers start scripts. But this means the second one is started before he build is complete
[21:57:46] <tabakhase> rmaw depends:?
[21:57:46] <ada_> rmaw: docker doesn't handle this 
[21:58:04] <ada_> rmaw: you can use depends_on: to make sure they get created in the right order, but if something is supposed tohappen that takes some time, it won't be enough
[21:58:28] <ada_> rmaw: the best bet is to program check & wait loops into your dependencies so that they check for some condition to be true before you allow them to start
[21:58:36] <ada_> this is a common entrypoint pattern
[21:59:13] <ada_> rmaw: for example, in the entrypoint script of the "second" one, you might write a loop that checks for some file to exist before you allow the main process in "second" to start
[21:59:50] <ada_> rmaw: https://docs.docker.com/compose/startup-order/
[22:05:44] <zoredache> I am probably thinking about doing something silly here, but is it possible for a container to have two connections on the same docker network?
[22:06:40] <akik> zoredache: there can be multiple connections by default
[22:10:25] <programmerq> zoredacheâ–¸ a given container can only be connected to one docker network one time. You can connect a container to multiple networks of course. Why do you want to connect it twice?
[22:10:25] <rmaw> ada_: thanks
[22:10:54] <rmaw> its a shame there isn't some built in way to signal between containers and wait for events

[23:07:53] <me-sudoer-dentne> ok i have a quick question
[23:08:19] <me-sudoer-dentne> how do you use a public ip adress as the ip adress for a docker container
[23:08:37] <me-sudoer-dentne> suppose i have 256 ip adresses
[23:09:24] <me-sudoer-dentne> and i would like to each use them as the ip adress for each container (one-one)
[23:09:36] <me-sudoer-dentne> how do i achieve that?
[23:11:02] <me-sudoer-dentne> 256 ip adresses bound to 256 containers
[23:11:24] <me-sudoer-dentne> each container accessible using that particular ip
[23:13:09] <DoofusCanadensis> https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/container-networking/
[23:13:35] <me-sudoer-dentne> like may be 123.221.234.21 is used by a container , maybe running an web-server - now what i want is that i give it an public ip adress such that people can access that website with that ip
[23:13:51] <me-sudoer-dentne> DoofusCanadensis: thanks
[23:17:13] <me-sudoer-dentne> DoofusCanadensis: but then will this ip accept inbound connections ?
[23:17:27] <DoofusCanadensis> that's the idea, yes
[23:17:39] <me-sudoer-dentne> wont this option use the ip of the host
[23:18:16] <DoofusCanadensis> not sure... I have load balancers in front of my hosts to begin with
