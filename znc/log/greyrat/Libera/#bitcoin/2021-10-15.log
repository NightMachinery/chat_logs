[03:34:55] <Guest48> yes but if you are impatient it is a lot like losing them, right?
[03:35:16] <CoJaBo_> Guest48: You might have to do something in your client tho to either resend with an increased fee, or reset it so it lets you try to send them again

[03:36:45] <Guest48> Wow that is good to know then thank you
[03:37:04] <CoJaBo_> It's been a while since I managed to do that, so I don't remember the specifics, but it'll be documented somewhere lol

[04:48:41] <Guest48> ah thank you busy that makes a lot of sense now
[04:49:25] <BUSY> Guest48, i like viewing the transaction fee as a 'rush fee' - you can decide for yourself how important the timeliness is
[04:49:50] <Guest48> Rush meaning based on the network demand / trading at the moment?
[04:50:16] *** Quits: Cfeed (~crypto@2a01:4f8:c0c:7f94::1) (Quit: ZNC - https://znc.in)
[04:50:31] <BUSY> the larger fee will incentivize a miner to confirm your transaction first as you'll be one of the more desirable transactions in the mempool
[04:51:41] <Guest48> Ok and you specify in the wallet the fee amount you are willing to pay?
[04:52:13] <BUSY> depends on the wallet i guess, but ideally yes - i believe the network currently has a built-in 1.00 minimum
[04:52:26] <BUSY> 1.00 satoshis per byte of data transmitting
[04:52:48] <Guest48> i see
[04:54:42] *** Joins: A1R (~crypto@2a01:4f8:c0c:7f94::1)
[04:55:20] <Guest48> thank you
[04:57:46] <BUSY> i like the visual shown @ mempool.space - the mempool is relatively empty at the moment, but the graphs show you how the different fees stack up over time

[05:01:09] <Guest48> You see it as empty because the charts took a big dip? MvB is the fee metric?
[05:01:45] *** Quits: virtu (~virtu@p5b15b9fd.dip0.t-ipconnect.de) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[05:01:49] <BUSY> MvB is the number/size of competing transactions waiting to be confirmed in a block by miners - there are very few queued transactions right now
[05:01:57] <Guest48> I have a lot of trouble understanding these metrics I would love if someone broke down that whole mempool.space page
[05:02:10] <Guest48> Ok
[05:02:13] <BUSY> the colors are the fee metric
[05:02:50] *** Joins: pitninja (~m-tauugl@129.146.31.42)
[05:02:54] <BUSY> so as the MvB of the mempool grows larger, the fee naturally grows as not everyone can wait many blocks for a confirmation
[05:03:21] <Guest48> Colors meaning the range column when you hover?
[05:03:28] *** Joins: virtu (~virtu@p5b15b7e3.dip0.t-ipconnect.de)
[05:04:01] <BUSY> that's right - the range is the sat fee - the size is number of transactions waiting at that fee level
[05:04:01] <Guest48> That makes sense
[05:04:53] <BUSY> if you hit charts at the top and blow it up to a year, you can see february through april where the mempool didn't empty one time
[05:05:29] <BUSY> a 1.00 fee would almost never be confirmed as the miners will select the 30.00+ fees
[05:06:03] <Guest48> Wow I see that how it has not emptied
[05:07:10] <BUSY> the transaction demand was outpacing the miner's block generation
[05:07:18] <Guest48> crazy
[05:07:45] <BUSY> whereas right now, a 1.00 satoshi fee would likely clear in <10 minutes
[05:08:16] <buZz> hehe
[05:08:27] <buZz> mempool.space is nice
[05:08:47] <Guest48> hmm this is a pricing question but I wonder how now the price is going up with so much less demand in the mempool
[05:08:54] <buZz> if you send tx and 'never goes through' , you can 'abandontx' in bitcoin core
[05:08:58] <buZz> stop transmitting it
[05:09:11] <buZz> then eventually, once nobody includes it, they will all drop it from mempool
[05:09:22] <buZz> and you have the coins back, maybe after a -rescan
[05:09:40] <Guest48> Ok thanks for the clarification buZz
[05:09:44] <buZz> or you could use RBF or CPFP to push the tx to go through if you really want it to happen
[05:09:57] <BUSY> Guest48, note that lightning network has picked up activity quite significantly - none of these transactions require miners/blocks so it's invisible to a block explorer like this
[05:10:27] <Guest48> ooh gotcha did not realize that but that makes sense too
[05:11:07] <buZz> yeah LN is cool
[05:11:16] <buZz> works near instantly and can be completely feeless
[05:11:32] <Guest48> That is my next book after mastering bitcoin
[05:11:56] <buZz> cool
[05:12:01] <buZz> layer2 stuff is cool
[05:12:31] <Guest48> Yea but I still would love to have a complete breakdown of this mempool site how did you all learn to understand it? Any resources?
[05:12:53] <BUSY> i wish they just called the whitepaper 'bitcoin abacus bartabs'
[05:15:06] <BUSY> the top line is recent (and upcoming blocks) - the left chart is the active mempool size and estimated fees - the right chart is how many new transactions are coming in and 'difficulty' is whether the blocks are coming in at their expected 10minute cycle
[05:15:16] <BUSY> then latest blocks and transactions should be pretty straight-forward
[05:16:03] <Guest48> Yea that part I understand from the book lol

[06:44:51] <Guest48> What about turing completeness of bitcoin smart contracts?

[06:45:38] <buZz> poorly implemented, their blockchain is now 5TB
[06:45:44] <buZz> nobody gonna sync that
[06:45:53] <Guest48> Yea that is not good
[06:45:54] <buZz> so only ppl running it are commercial entities

[06:46:25] <Guest48> Yea and I saw vitalik say on a video he doesn't want fees lol

[06:47:33] <buZz> 0.00000001 bitcoin = satoshi
[06:47:37] <buZz> 0.00000001 bitcoin = 1 satoshi
[06:47:40] <Guest48> gotcha
[06:47:57] <buZz> its like 'cent' but more zeroes :P

[17:23:26] <Seeder99> need help, running bitcoin-qt inside debian VM on proxmox (Dell R720xd). Server is UPS protected with NUT 4 minute timer to shutdown whenever power goes out. However, bitcoin-qt does not shutdown cleanly and is ~30 hours behind upon restart when it was up to date before power out.
[17:24:07] <Seeder99> don't know where to begin to fix this, anyone?
[17:24:18] <kinlo> Seeder99: do you have basic linux skills?
[17:24:30] <kinlo> I would start looking at iops, cpu, swap...
[17:24:39] <Seeder99> very basic with google as teacher
[17:25:36] <Diablo-D3> Seeder99: I'm assuming you have the rpc api running, and ran "bitcoind stop"?
[17:25:59] *** Joins: rageagainst (~rageagain@garza.riseup.net)

[17:35:36] <Seeder99> it's an automated server shutdown sent from Network UPS Tools after a power out event, I can't anticipate when it's gonna happen and send a bitcoind stop command or where to implement the command in the process. By the way, running qt in gui instead of daemon
[17:36:29] <buZz> Seeder99: maybe if your UPS can only run the server for 4 minutes, you need a fatter UPS
[17:37:22] <buZz> my server running several fullnodes can run ~45 minutes on my UPS
[17:37:23] *** Joins: AaronvanW (~AaronvanW@71pc74.sshunet.nl)
[17:37:37] <buZz> shutdown msg comes with 10 mins remaining
[17:37:56] <buZz> hasnt happened ever yet :) power recovers fast enough
[17:38:32] <buZz> but indeed, shutting down bitcoind or any fullnode takes quite some time, it needs to write a lot of data away
[17:38:41] <buZz> with slow storage that could easily take more than 4 minutes
[17:39:04] <kinlo> yeah, I wouldn't recommend using the os shutdown unless the timers are properly tweaked so it waits long enough
[17:39:06] <Seeder99> Actually, it has a 40 minute runtime, if power out for 4 minutes it's gonna be a long one, so power hungry server shuts down to keep router and wifi up for a couple hours. Got kids? they need internet access lol
[17:39:10] <buZz> and running a full GUI and QT interface will -not- make it any faster :D

By the way, running qt in gui instead of daemon
[17:40:33] <Diablo-D3> you *can* do that, actually
[17:41:41] <Diablo-D3> you have multiple ways of doing this, 1) use nut network mode, have the VMs listen, 2) setup bitcoin properly as a service on your vm's distro, have service script call "bitcoind stop" on shutdown, 3) it being qt doesnt mean anything, it will also listen to rpc when told to (bitcoind is an rpc client when given rpc commands, works on any bitcoin rpc server)
[17:42:02] <Diablo-D3> and 4 minutes is unreliably short
[17:42:28] <Diablo-D3> the *real* question is, why you're 30 hours behind
[17:42:39] <Diablo-D3> it sounds like your chain db might be corrupted and its not being repaired
[17:44:07] <buZz> NUT is configurable anyway, when it will send the shutdown msg
[17:44:41] <Diablo-D3> nut is ridiculously configurable, its great
[17:45:25] <timechain> 93.95.227.130:8333 full node, grab the chain from here if you want to download it fast, most nodes are behind Tor or they are very slow and located in the USA
[17:46:17] <buZz> ^ unadvisable to use
[17:46:30] <Seeder99> NUT sends the command after 4 minutes on battery, just need the VM to close out bitcoin core before proxmox stops the vm instead of killing it
[17:47:21] <timechain> buZz what is unadvisable to use?
[17:48:23] <Seeder99> closing bitcoin-qt manually takes 30 to 45 seconds in this VM, chain is located on an 8 by 3TB disks in raidz2

[17:54:35] <NoImNotNineVolt> i thought that irc net was converted to a honeypot for scammers and grifters.
[17:54:36] <timechain> NoImNotNineVolt actually, satoshi created that channel on freenode

[17:54:56] <NoImNotNineVolt> timechain: right, but i think andrew lee bought the network after that.
[17:55:18] <NoImNotNineVolt> and then the aforementioned conversion happened.
[17:55:23] <timechain> nanotube was not even born when satoshi and halfin used the #bitcoin channel on freenode :)

[17:56:06] <kinlo> and buZz stop feeding the trolls please...
[17:56:06] <NoImNotNineVolt> it's not really relevant who created the channel, since the channel's creation predates lee's purchase of freenode and the subsequent conversion of the net into a honeypot for scammers and grifters.
