[11:53:05] <osfe_> Hi there, I've been using lsp mode for 2 weeks and that's pretty nice. So far the only thing that prevents me from moving to emacs is the refactoring system 
[11:55:07] <osfe_> is there any efficient refactoring stuff I can use with (spac)emacs ?

I implemented something for python here https://github.com/kassick/dotfiles/blob/main/dots/emacs/spacemacs.d/layers/kzk-python/funcs.el . It mostly works, but it has a few bugs I haven't had the time to investigate.

[19:06:27] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> refactoring largely depended on the LSP client
