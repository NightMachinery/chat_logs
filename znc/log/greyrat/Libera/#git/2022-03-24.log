[01:09:12] <anddam> osse: no, it's in the middle
[01:09:23] <anddam> I have no issue rebasing onto the new squashed commit
[01:09:31] <osse> then you need rebase --interactive
[01:09:35] <anddam> I am bit embarassed to show this but I managed to grow this https://termbin.com/kb3n
[01:09:50] <osse> with commit --fixup and rebase --autosquash and GIT_EDITOR=true

[01:12:04] <osse> I don't understand the question

[01:13:10] <anddam> I squash the commits I want  say from B to E in    A -- B -- C -- D -- E -- F -- G    , then rebase F onto E'

[01:13:44] <osse> no I outlined a new as-little-interactive-as-possible interactive rebase :p
[01:13:51] <anddam> the commit --fixup would be the commit at each interactive step, and from commit --help I see that's in rebase --autosquash

[01:14:25] <osse> it's not relevant if you want to squash commits already created
[01:15:01] <osse> in your case: git rebase -i A, mark C-E all as fixup in the editor (leave B as pick), save and close.
[01:15:11] <anddam> I don't see much difference than git add; git commit --amend  , is there any?

[01:16:34] <anddam> let's see if it comes togheter
[01:16:37] <osse> commit --amend makes sense for fixing up the newest (current) commit. commit --fixup makes sense if you want to fixup an earlier commit

[01:26:42] <anddam> so I had these three release-branch and I kept merging master into each of them, to get the updates into releases
[01:26:46] <osse> anddam: imagine you notice a typo or a mistake or whatever, so you make a new commit G after F. It would then make sense to flip the order of F and G so that you could squash G in with the rest

[01:28:00] <osse> the reason I started babbling about this is because you mentioned doing it without rebase --interactive. so I started outlining a way to do this kind of thing as automatic as possible (ie. as little interactive as possible)
[01:28:00] <anddam> so basically I merged master into devel once per each release- branch
[01:28:34] <anddam> can you see my pastebin?
[01:29:06] <anddam> I thought about squashing each commit where the message is "Merge branch 'master'…"
[01:29:08] <osse> yes, my eyes are bleeding
[01:29:23] <anddam> he, imagine working with that
[01:30:11] <anddam> anyway I want to tidy that history, but now I wonder what would happen with all the merge commits, can I reasonably squash those considering they have two parents?

[01:30:41] <osse> not really. by default rebase will just pretend merges don't exist

[01:32:39] <anddam> there are binary file changes, that I know handle outside git
[01:32:46] <anddam> (hence the "saner" part)
[01:33:47] <anddam> or rather with stuff from the repo, but used via CLI tools, so no more multiplication of changes from master
[01:33:49] <osse> you can reset --hard HEAD~somenumber to pretend you never did any of these merges, and then do one now.
[01:33:55] <osse> the end result should be the same

[04:07:40] <yagamilito> Hello
[04:07:40] <yagamilito> i am using github actions to read files after pull request is merged
[04:07:41] <yagamilito> i tried like this
[04:07:41] <yagamilito> https://pastebin.com/raw/ZUuhT52B
[04:07:42] <yagamilito> with one file it works as expected but if i try to read multiple files
[04:07:42] <yagamilito> it considers multiple file names as single string
[04:07:43] <yagamilito> eg:
[04:07:43] <yagamilito> single string
[04:07:44] <yagamilito> 'file1 file'
[04:07:44] <yagamilito> expecting
[04:07:45] <yagamilito> 'file1'
[04:07:45] <yagamilito> 'file2'
[04:07:46] <yagamilito> how to achieve this
[04:07:46] <yagamilito> Thanks
[04:08:52] <BtbN> This is #git though
[04:10:52] <yagamilito> sorry my bad

[05:44:04] <peepsalot> BtbN: i'm starting to think the problem is in how git considers files similar.  the commit which moved files around altered between 0 and 1% of lines in those files.  but there was also a different commit before that restructuring, which applied some automated formatting, altering at least whitespace for majority of code

[15:27:04] <Guest31> Any ideas? Could I cherry-pick the new commit (it's squashed, thankfully) and auto-resolve issues by considering it to be the "total truth"? Then maybe the cherry-picked commit _are_ the changes?

[20:09:55] <OnlineCop> How can I 1) detect that I'm inside a git repo and, 2) get the repo's root directly? I'm writing a bash function to do an expensive one-time grep for a keyword, and I'd like to store the results in a file inside the repo's root. Would I use `git rev-parse --git-dir --short 2>/dev/null`, and if it returns a non-empty value, I'll know the path where I can store it?
[20:11:19] <osse> OnlineCop: git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree is probably what you want
[20:11:32] <osse> or git rev-parse --show-toplevel

[23:45:12] <vaio> hello; when you commit something, then change your email address using git config user.email; do the old commit keep the previous email config, or it doesn't matter at all until you push ?
[23:45:31] <vaio> im not sure how to test then check this
[23:45:52] <ikke> vaio: it's recorded when you commit
[23:45:58] <ikke> git log --format=fuller
[23:46:13] <ikke> It's part of the hash of the commit
[23:46:22] <vaio> ah, thanks
[23:49:23] <vaio> this explains why the user got it's push rejected by the server at work x)
[23:49:38] <vaio> but at least i know what to look for, now
[23:49:53] <ikke> Do they verify committer / author names?
[23:50:46] <vaio> it seems to at least verify the email address
[23:50:51] <ikke> ok
[23:50:52] <vaio> i'm not sure about other settings

[23:55:42] <vaio> huh, i'm reading about editing emails in commits
[23:56:12] <vaio> i wonder if the server will only forbid the user to push new commits that don't use the correct email
[23:56:18] <vaio> or if all commits need to be edited
[23:56:44] <vaio> if so, i guess all users will be blocked until that got corrected
[23:56:54] <vaio> eheheh, not my problem tho
