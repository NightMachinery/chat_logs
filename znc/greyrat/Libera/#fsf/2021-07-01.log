[00:09:19] <belgin> i wonder why people keep saying matrix is complicated. it took me about 10 minutes to set it up on a cheap vps for me and my friends
[00:10:01] <belgin> maybe they're referring to the protocol and/or implementation
[00:12:53] <I_am_6r1d> some are very attached to old operating systems and platforms, this might limit the amount of involvement

[00:15:02] <AppleGNU> Matrix is another unnecessary protocol. And figuring out how to connect to an IRC bridge is far from intuitive when they could just have buttons for that.

[00:16:58] <lts> Does not need systemd. Setting up a multithreaded instance with workers is not trivial, and the initial user experience with element is not great when it demands to setup encryption keys and whatnot. There are dozens if not hundreds of variable to set in a text config file, content of which changes with synapse versions. The amount of bugs in github projects is rather astonishing.
[00:17:31] <lts> All this is quite a lot more complicated than the average attention span of a modern internet user
[00:17:57] <belgin> lts: yeah i wish they removed the confirmation thing when accessing with a new device
[00:18:30] <dstolfa> it's not so much matrix itself that has issues, it's the python implementation and element

[00:24:13] <belgin> it would be interesting to write a matrix server in a better language than python, like rust or maybe even ada. with ada you can even mathematically prove its correctness

[03:28:03] <Armand> Well.....
[03:28:07] <travankor> lol nice
[03:28:13] <specing> I have multiple fully libre AVR and PIC microcontrollers
[03:28:26] <travankor> specing: I guess fpga should count as well
[03:28:42] <dstolfa> travankor: i'm not quite sure what you mean by "RYF" hardware, because i use an ath9k_htc adapter to get libre wifi, but my laptop's a dell precision 5550 which works fine on a FSDG-compliant OS, it just doesn't work with libreboot
[03:28:43] <specing> at a few milliong 8 bit instructions,they blow 1960s computers out of the water
[03:28:44] <Armand> You could redesign the Z80 on FPGA... ;)
[03:28:58] <specing> * at a few million 8 bit instructions per second, they blow 1960s computers out of the water

[03:29:39] <travankor> dstolfa: https://ryf.fsf.org/
[03:29:41] <dstolfa> and given that my precision 5550 has 64 gigs of RAM and 8c/16t, it runs gnome pretty well
[03:29:44] <dstolfa> travankor: i know what ryf is
[03:29:49] <dstolfa> but it's not very precise in this discussion at all
[03:29:52] <Armand> I'm actually building a small team working on an 8-bit CPU design. :D
[03:30:01] <specing> I have some stm32 as well, but they already have some (nonfree?) bootloader code baked into them
[03:31:01] <dstolfa> saying "libre hardware" can mean "hardware that you can run a fully libre operating system on", "hardware that requires no non-free firmware" and "hardware that not only requires no non-free firmware, but takes it a step further such as libresoc" and "hardware that was produced using no non-free processes whatsoever"
[03:31:09] <dstolfa> so my question was which one you mean
[03:31:16] <dstolfa> if the first one, gnome runs perfectly fine on it
[03:31:22] *** Quits: tagomago (~anton@user/tagomago) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[03:31:40] <Armand> Like I said.. Gnome should be fine on anything that's not a potato.

[03:38:39] <Armand> "x200" = ThinkPad ?
[03:39:18] <travankor> yes from 2008
[03:39:22] <Armand> Huumm
[03:39:35] <Armand> I'm using an X220t right now, with Mint Cinnamon.
[03:39:48] <Armand> Bit later than the X200. 
[03:40:36] <Armand> Mint 17.3 with Mate or Cinnamon runs really well on my Pentium M systems though.
[03:42:19] <Armand> Somewhat better on the desktop Pentium M though, due to DDR2, SATA and PCIe.. obvs. :P

[03:44:45] <travankor> it's great if you can run modern gnome stack on ancient computers
[03:45:03] <travankor> although I don't like the design decisions of modern gnome so I don't use it :P
[03:45:36] <dstolfa> that's fair, gnome is very opinionated on how things should work. i like some parts of it, dislike others, but overall i like that i can use it with 0 setup

[03:46:22] <travankor> that's a completely reasonable take as well
[03:46:58] <Armand> I have more of an issue with how things are done on Ubuntu.. lol
[03:47:06] <travankor> gnome probably has the best "OOB" experience of all DE's

[04:10:38] <tpefreedom> Armand, do you have a project page/website yet?
[04:10:52] <Armand> Narp.. Keeping everything private for now.
[04:11:07] <Armand> At least until we have a working core on FPGA.
[04:11:25] <tpefreedom> I just want to know more about the project.
[04:11:44] <tpefreedom> Are you going to use an existing ISA (Instruction set architecture) or create your own?
[04:11:56] <Armand> It's all from scratch.
[04:12:18] <Armand> We were considering using the Z80 as a base.. but we don't want to copy any potential bad habits. :P
[04:13:10] <tpefreedom> I think most or all of the cp/m source is available and since you are using the 8080/z80 architecture as a base, you might be able to port it.
[04:13:32] <tpefreedom> (Not only availabe but under either a bsd 2-clause or 3-clause)
[04:14:38] <Armand> Yeah, we're not interested in using any existing license model.
[04:15:59] <Armand> Another reason we stepped back from the Z80 as a source..
[04:16:20] <tpefreedom> What os are you going to use on it though?
[04:16:21] <Armand> Anything that's already done, software-wise, is under some kind of license.
[04:17:04] <Armand> Nothing as yet, there's no goal set besides having it working with it's own assembly language.
[04:17:15] <Armand> The core design is the hardest part to get right.

[17:27:03] <immibis> is it outright illegal or is it "you must get re-approved by the regulator"? the latter is *slightly* less worrying
[17:27:51] <immibis> i think the latter is already typical for substantial modifications, because they invalidate all the testing the manufacturer did, so you need to either show your modifications are safe or have some kind of waiver that you know they could be unsafe
[17:28:16] <immibis> cars are a tricky case because their safety doesn't just affect the one using them

[17:45:50] <immibis> they are totally different things handled by totally different people

[17:57:37] <kompowiec> reproducible builds
[17:59:42] *** Quits: KUrare (~KUrare@user/kurare) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[18:00:06] <immibis> kompowiec: well with a non-reproducible build the hash is different every time you build it. So what use is checking a hash?
[18:01:41] <kompowiec> if a page has been hijacked in some way, I can easily check the previous hash on archive.org
[18:01:54] <immibis> kompowiec: let me put it differently: what do you gain by checking a hash?
[18:02:31] <kompowiec> and reproducible build does not solve the variable hash problem. Each software update will change it.
[18:03:42] <johns> the point of reproducible builds is that you can build it yourself and see that the hash matches the expected official hash provided by someone you trust
[18:04:17] <johns> yes, it changes with an update, but you would also be building it again to have the updated version
[18:04:41] <immibis> kompowiec: the point of a reproducible build is to let you match the binary with the source code. How does "checking the hash" accomplish that?
[18:04:49] <kompowiec> in other words, it is rather something more useful for programmers.
[18:05:08] <kompowiec> now i understand, thanks
[18:05:22] <immibis> otherwise you'd have to decompile Debian's foobar2000-1.2.3 with a fine-toothed comb, in order to determine that it actually is foobar2000-1.2.3, not foobar2000-1.2.3+backdoor-0.1
[18:05:26] <johns> this doesn't operate in a vacuum -- you should be checking the hash against something on an https page, and the binary with that haash should also be signed

[21:16:31] <psymin> I could see there being benefit for groups to exist that promote the use of essential things that are also unencumbered by IP restrictions.  Agriculture that doesn't rely on patented life forms, medicine that doesn't rely on patented drugs, education that doesn't rely on copyrighted texts, etc.
