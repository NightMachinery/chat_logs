[13:04:52] <Activ8> not sure what the wuhan wiggles is 
[13:04:55] <Activ8> you talk in code lol
[13:44:29] <archpc> Covid is kicking my ass
[13:52:51] <Activ8> oh you have covid?
[13:54:44] <archpc> Hell yea 
[13:54:50] <archpc> positive as of the 20th
[13:55:08] <Activ8> don't cough in here we don't want it
[13:55:24] <archpc> I‚Äôm past coughing 
[13:55:43] <archpc> I‚Äôve been live blogging my experience over at ##covid-19
[13:56:49] <Activ8> I'm not too interested in covid, tired of the news now
[13:56:59] <Activ8> we should have just had a full zombie outbreak would have been far more interesting
[13:57:12] <archpc> Honestly 
[13:57:24] <archpc> I‚Äôve been trying to keep myself distracted 
[13:58:54] <Activ8> so you will be off work right
[13:59:03] <archpc> yeah
[14:00:31] <Activ8> so what's one up to today then
[14:00:46] <Activ8> the sun is shining here in the UK but I can feel a chill through the window, I think autumn is coming
[14:00:52] <archpc> literally just finding anything to do to take my mind off the pain
[14:00:55] <archpc> nice
[14:01:06] <archpc> Activ8, do you use powershell at all
[14:01:32] <Activ8> a little bit but not on a big scale, basic commands
[14:01:40] <Activ8> I use it for remote 0365 shell
[14:01:56] <Activ8> I control tenants, we have about 150 clients
[14:01:59] <archpc> ah, i was gonna share a nice deployment script i hacked toghether
[14:02:00] <archpc> nice
[14:02:20] <Activ8> deployment script for what
[14:02:42] <archpc> just to turn winget installs into a nice one liner ps1 file
[14:02:49] <archpc> mainly for my personal use
[14:06:16] <Activ8> you talking about application installs here pulling apps using winget
[14:07:18] <archpc> yeah
[14:07:31] <Activ8> most of my applications are run from a SDHC card as I don't really use intense apps. I also make sure I don't need to install apps on a PC where possible and I keep it on me at all times with a backup.
[14:07:44] <Activ8> USB/SDHC
[14:08:00] <archpc> smart
[14:08:01] <Activ8> you heard of portable apps
[14:08:29] <Activ8> as in https://portableapps.com/
[14:08:35] <Activ8> I run everything like that
[14:08:37] <Activ8> where possible
[14:09:42] <archpc> i despise those
[14:10:06] <Activ8> I use them for simplicity, my machine ever needs to be formatted I lose no data
[14:10:19] <Activ8> I keep all data away from main machines where possible
[14:10:53] <Activ8> I have a nvme 256gb caddy as well usb-c/usb, which I can run all apps from as well
[14:11:47] <Activ8> all my command promt / powershell gets ran from it as well
[14:11:51] <Activ8> in a container
[14:21:41] <Activ8> personal choice, I been had before with big data loss so the choice is to keep data reduced where possible.  I don't keep any big files any more like movies, music e.t.c just important documents and backups all remote and on local storage in sync
[14:26:08] <archpc> that's whats up
[14:33:06] <Activ8> huh
[14:34:06] <Snuupy> I never remember which folder they're in for portable apps
[14:34:18] <Activ8> I don't need too there's a menu
