[00:05:12] <__adrian> zxcvbn
[00:05:16] <__adrian> strongly recommend AGAINST character-class-based rules (like "must have a digit"). these are counterproductive.
[00:05:36] <__adrian> they lead to hard-to-remember but easy-to-bruteforce passwords.

[00:06:41] <stenno> battery horse staple
[00:06:43] <stenno> yes that
[00:06:49] <__adrian> correct
[00:07:55] <relipse> __adrian: my boss told me to put a password strength thing like the one i just pasted
[00:07:58] <relipse> so its not up to me
[00:08:04] <relipse> if it were up to me there would only be a min length

[00:14:44] <relipse> its ok it was a fun exercise: https://github.com/relipse/jquery.passwordStrengthForcer.js
[00:14:45] <biberu> similar to how when someone asks odd and oddly specific questions here you might suspect they have a real problem they aren't telling you about
[00:15:03] <biberu> anyway it was just a general observation
[00:17:51] <__adrian> relipse: it means that you, knowing better, ought to be giving feedback to those who don't know better
[00:18:15] <relipse> sometimes that can ruin a relationship __adrian
[00:18:24] <__adrian> no
[00:18:30] <relipse> pick and choose your feedback battles
[00:18:37] <__adrian> it might prove that a relationship was bad
[00:18:46] <__adrian> but it won't hurt a good relationship
[00:18:59] <relipse> and not worth the risk
[00:19:25] <__adrian> and if you want to "pick and choose" issues, this is a pretty important one
[00:19:43] <relipse> it just means that half of our users will forget their passwords
[00:19:49] <relipse> lol our problem later
[00:19:59] <__adrian> no, it means their passwords are easily cracked.
[00:20:13] <stenno> can you use pattern on type='password' ?
[00:20:16] <stenno> pattern attribute
[00:20:21] <__adrian> it directly increases risks to your clients. it goes against best practices and industry standards (i.e., if someone sues you over it, you'll have a hard time winning)
[00:20:32] <biberu> again generally, but if i enlist the help of an expert i expect to be (politely) told when i'm wrong
[00:20:39] <__adrian> ^
[00:20:59] <__adrian> stenno: no idea, probably? tias
[00:21:01] <relipse> __adrian: then why do most, most sites use password complexity measures
[00:21:20] <__adrian> > password complexity measures   // this is not what i said
[00:21:28] <__adrian> i said character-class-based rules
[00:21:43] <__adrian> e.g., "must have one upper, one lower, one digit"
[00:22:00] <stenno> ideally your pw should be generated by a keychain anyway
[00:22:10] <__adrian> and what do other people's bad decisions have to do with it anyway?
[00:22:25] <relipse> because xkdc said it, means its true?
[00:22:35] <relipse> i agree with xkdc by the way
[00:22:42] <stenno> well its math
[00:22:49] <stenno> its not a question of opinion
[00:22:53] <__adrian> you don't have to quote xkcd. NIST would be more convincing.
[00:23:01] <stenno> ^
[00:23:08] <__adrian> and yes- it's not something to agree/disagree with
[00:23:20] <stenno> https://auth0.com/blog/dont-pass-on-the-new-nist-password-guidelines/
[00:23:31] <stenno> sorry looking for primary source
[00:23:41] <stenno> https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html
[00:23:43] <__adrian> https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63-3.html
[00:23:51] <__adrian> it's in the link you started with  ;)
[00:24:19] <stenno> Allow at least 64 characters in length to support the use of passphrases. Encourage users to make memorized secrets as lengthy as they want, using any characters they like (including spaces), thus aiding memorization.
[00:24:38] <stenno> also there is a reason they talk about 'passphrases' and not 'passwords'
[00:24:41] <__adrian> ^ more importantly, REQUIRE at least 12, and preferably 16.
[00:25:06] <stenno> Do not impose other composition rules (e.g. mixtures of different character types) on memorized secrets.
[00:25:14] <stenno> here very explicit about what __adrian was talking about
[00:27:07] <__adrian> zxcvbn does all these things (though i think you'll need to configure the minimum length longer)
[00:27:19] <__adrian> does everything you need, aside from writing the html form
[00:28:01] <__adrian> stenno++ that's a fantastic article
[00:28:37] *** Quits: ge (~g@37.214.72.241) (Remote host closed the connection)
[00:28:51] <biberu> fwiw, your boss's real motivation here is probably just "i want to help users to choose strong passwords"
[00:28:58] <__adrian> ^
[00:29:05] <__adrian> so help them with that
[00:29:11] <__adrian> that's your job  :)
[00:30:03] <relipse> it sounds like the most secure is to not only provide a high min length but also to run a check against a blacklist
[00:30:14] <relipse> after scanning that article that stenno posted
[00:30:27] <__adrian> keep reading, but those are both very good starts
[00:30:38] <relipse> and obviuosly throttling attempts
[00:31:21] <relipse> what is this zxcvbn thing you are talking about?
[00:31:37] <biberu> be mindful that throttling can be a dos vector against the actual user if implemented poorly
[00:32:02] <__adrian> it's an answer to your original question (a package for password strength assessment)
[00:32:04] <relipse> biberu: you mean throttle by ip address?
[00:32:37] <__adrian> yeah, throttling doesn't need to be "10 attempts and then you're locked out for an hour"
[00:32:55] <__adrian> it just needs to be "you can't try more than once every three seconds"
[00:32:59] <stenno> if throttling just means 1 per second
[00:33:01] <stenno> yep
[00:33:03] <stenno> its already enough
[00:33:07] <stenno> or 3, fine
[00:33:27] <biberu> i'm still not talking any specifics, but if you e.g. temporarily freeze an account after to many attempts someone can prevent a specific user from using your service
[00:33:33] <__adrian> real users take longer than this to wait for the page to load and type their password in, so they'll never notice. but it makes brute force attempts completely impractical.
[00:34:12] <relipse> the last time I did throttling, i increased the blocking limit after a certain number of attempts
[00:34:19] <__adrian> nont a good idea
[00:34:26] <relipse> first 3 are free, next one throttle at 15 seconds
[00:34:40] <__adrian> it will lead to real users being locked out just because they forgot to switch off caps lock
[00:34:54] <__adrian> and it doesn't slow down attackers enough.
[00:35:03] <relipse> so user at IP address is blocked for 15 seconds, after that he can make a nother attempt
[00:35:18] <__adrian> so i grab a dozen IPs and rotate them.
[00:35:29] <__adrian> you've locked out your real users, and i'm still cracking passwords.
[00:35:37] <relipse> i didn't lock out any real users
[00:35:49] <relipse> real user is on another ip
[00:35:59] * __adrian sighs
[00:36:17] <relipse> after another attempt then throttle at 30 seconds
[00:36:21] <relipse> something like that
[00:36:42] <relipse> don't give up on me bro
[00:36:51] <relipse> i'm just articulating my ideas
[00:36:53] <relipse> maybe they are wrong

[00:46:30] <stenno> 1 second should be enough, yes
[00:46:43] <stenno> but it doesn't really make a difference for a real user if its 1 or 3
[00:46:48] <stenno> so might aswell use 3

[14:08:45] <hetiii> I have a kubernetes cluster that handle multiple drupal websites, some of them have a low traffic, some other high. What I see in one of most usage site, the php-fpm run currently in single pod a 32 php-fpm childs, each sonsume about 150~200MB of ram. pm.max_requests = 1000 pm.max_children = 100 pm.process_idle_timeout = 10s;
[14:09:44] <hetiii> Now I wonder if make sense to optimize it a bit and use instead ondemand a static mode with about 20 workers and run more pods.
[14:09:51] <hetiii> What you suggest here?
[14:10:20] <hetiii> What is a recommended setup of php-fpm for kubernetes world.
[14:11:28] <TinoDidriksen> Is that RES or SHR RAM usage?

[14:19:05] <TinoDidriksen> Righty then
[14:19:50] <Naktibalda> if I remember correctly, static mode is recommended if you use autoscaling in Kubernetes
[14:23:44] *** Joins: BrunoFontes (~bruno@187.115.253.43)
[14:23:54] <hetiii> yea, this is probably something that I will need to do next. But need to have some start point about this PM settings to more or less be able to predict resources consumption for single pod, and then add horizontal autoscaling to spread it over nodes if that make sense as now it's under the control

[15:16:53] *** Quits: Hiccup (cHoy@user/hiccup) (Remote host closed the connection)
[15:18:36] <hetiii> ordos, yea let's suppose that need to support ~300000 citizens
[15:19:01] <Naktibalda> 20 times a day or once in 5 years?
[15:19:05] <ordos> hah
[15:19:12] <hetiii> ya good question :)
[15:20:57] <hetiii> to be honest hard to said for me as I don't have more metrics that I paste here already. Currently I had 3 pods of this page where each spawn ~32 php-fpm processes to handle the current traffic and this setup more or less work about some weeks
[15:21:16] <ordos> using static?
[15:21:41] <ordos> "and use instead ondemand a static mode" not sure which you meant
[15:22:06] <Naktibalda> fixed number of children processes
[15:22:07] <hetiii> ram consumtion in pods vary between 700~1200MB. Current setup use ondemand pm mode.
[15:22:13] *** Quits: tirnanog (~tirnanog@user/tirnanog) (Quit: = "")
[15:23:36] <ordos> So with the ondemand you'll just take a hit on spawning/killing workers but overall it may prove to use less mem
[15:23:42] <ordos> again, depends on the nature of the traffic
[15:23:56] <ordos> Naktibalda, I was trying to ascertain which he was using
[15:24:09] <hetiii> ordos, I mean process manager modes: https://tideways.com/profiler/blog/an-introduction-to-php-fpm-tuning
[15:24:36] <ordos> goodness ok clearly I wasn't clear
[15:24:51] <ordos> not asking for definitions of static vs ondemand, instead asking which you are currently using
[15:25:16] <hetiii> ah, ok :)
[15:26:01] <hetiii> so yea, currently ondemand and wonder if make sense to change it to static with maybe some autoscaling from kubernetes.
[15:27:18] <ordos> only way to determine that is with decent metrics
[15:27:35] <ordos> static will be trickier to optimise for, but makes sense for high traffic

For example, start by: providing the code in question; describing what you expect the code to do; what it's doing that you didn't expect; and include all error information relevant to your issue (see error reporting) in a pastebin.

[16:22:09] <Eugen80> I need a tool to edit special information that is stored in 5-6 linked tables. Manually it is difficult and slow (because of many foreign keys), but if there was a gui, it would be much easier.
[16:22:59] <Blondie101010> you missed the point...  are you offering data editing software or services, or are you doing something useful?
[16:23:18] <Blondie101010> I know I'm oversimplifying but it's pretty important

[16:24:06] <Blondie101010> if you make an app to edit 5-6 linked tables, you will make a mess
[16:24:11] <Eugen80> I need that tool for me to make my life easier :-)
[16:24:49] <Blondie101010> and you give no useful detail to even describe it clearly to you
[16:25:32] <Blondie101010> but for example, if you make an app to manage your store inventory which is planned to have 5-6 tables, then you can start building it intelligently
[16:26:20] <Blondie101010> most apps edit DB tables one way or another, and that should NOT define how they operate
[16:28:52] <Eugen80> tables are already there.. every 2-3 monthes they need to be updated and than you begin to examine and collect foreign keys to insert correct data. This is a slow and error-prone process.
[16:31:34] <Blondie101010> no doubt!
[16:31:48] <Blondie101010> it's error prone because it's badly done
[16:32:00] <Blondie101010> what is that data?
[16:36:03] <Eugen80> I don't think it is badly done.. The db structure is normalized to store this kind of data. It is different constants for different sites / countries / languages
[16:37:15] <__adrian> Eugen80: it's still not really clear what you need ("edit tables" implies you just need Workbench or similar), but "i don't want a framework" is a red flag. you should _prefer_ using existing tools, libraries, etc..
[16:38:50] <Eugen80> edit table content, not tables. I thought it could be done in a single file / class

[16:39:16] <__adrian> "I thought it could be done in a single file / class"  this is also aa big, red flag
