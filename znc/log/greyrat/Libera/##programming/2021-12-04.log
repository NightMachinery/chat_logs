[00:07:09] <nomagno> A preprocessor for an assembly language is weird, but sure. The C preprocessor can do the job
[00:07:23] <pyzozord> I'm wondering if it's expressive enough
[00:07:26] <nomagno> Just, expect C function syntax to be required for multi-arg macros
[00:07:35] <nomagno> It's very expressive
[00:07:42] <KillerWasp> I'm still thinking about what to do with my own emulators.
[00:07:44] <nomagno> C99 preprocessor is turing-complete AFAIK
[00:07:45] <pyzozord> writing multilne functions in the C preprocessor is kind of annyoing with the \ at the end of the line
[00:08:43] <nomagno> pyzozord: I mean, if statements were terminated by something other than newline it'd be better, yes. But it's not a huge drama unless you're going to be writing preprocessor statements as frequently as you write actual code
[00:09:11] <pyzozord> I was thinking more preprocessor than actual code
[00:09:27] <nomagno> That sounds like an extremely weird use case
[00:09:36] <pyzozord> yeah it's experimental
[00:09:42] <nomagno> but I still recommend it even if you don't like the \ thing
[00:10:11] <nomagno> It's the most portable preprocessor you're going to find, at least.
[00:10:26] <nomagno> More so than even something like sed
[00:10:28] <pyzozord> my idea was to essentially build out a pseudo-language out of the preprocessor macros, that just expand to wasm
[00:11:09] <nomagno> You can write a POSIX shell script that reads a custom simple preprocessor format and replaces it from a file using sed

[00:13:43] <pyzozord> if I'm using shell, I think I'd rather just use python or php or perl. In python I'll need to write some scaffolding code to make ganarating code conveniant. PHP seems to me a good fit because it is natural a templating language because of <?php ?> and perl I only heard about but, I heard that it was in fact designed for text processing

[00:14:30] <nomagno> Unreasonable portability, these days, perhaps
[00:14:38] <pyzozord> but that C preprocessor is really interesting too
[00:15:33] <nomagno> The C preprocessor is insanely cool, you can write some truly horrendous macros that expand and expand and expand and expand... to get some really short function to expand into a monster

So it leaves with 0 mallocs at the end of main; it actually has very little global state

Your only bet for communication is proprietary, unencrypted platforms, tough I doubt they currently record VR activity, they definitely could and maybe do in indirect ways. From a theoretical and moral point of view, mainstream VR is very much not private
[02:49:23] <arahael> flakland: with VR, and if people are spending all their time on VR, basically all the interactions are monitored, yeah? by whom, and can that be avoided?  the biggest player is facebook, afterall.

[04:14:50] <[itchyjunk]> but you don't need to install more than one or two games at a time anyways
[04:14:53] <nomagno> arahael: most headsets either run Android or connect to a PC. You can watch it any way you want
[04:14:53] <xsperry> nomagno, while PC VR has better graphics, with good enough system, tracking is surprisingly as good, or better, on quest 2
[04:14:55] <arahael> [itchyjunk]: Ah, that's a good ballpark, then. I think 256 GB will be heaps, then, and 128 GB might be limiting.
[04:15:03] <nomagno> Downloaded, streaming service...
[04:15:24] <nomagno> Prime video, Netflix, YouTube, IDK the Quest 2 runs android
[04:15:26] <arahael> nomagno: Oh, interesting.  Would it work with say, my mac?
[04:15:35] <arahael> nomagno: As far as video is concerned and all that.
[04:15:45] <kennyd> how does VR porn work? you can turn your head around? hehe
[04:15:45] <arahael> I think VR games won't work with Oculus on the mac, though.
[04:15:46] <nomagno> arahael: there are apps to project your Mac screen to your desktop
[04:15:53] <arahael> nomagno: Ah, interesting.

[04:16:34] <arahael> [itchyjunk]: Asking the real questions!

[04:30:00] <nomagno> arahael: The Valve Index uses controllers with haptic and distance sensors to track your fingers. Oh right, I forgot the Quest 2 tracks tour hands nowadays!
[04:30:02] <nomagno> Yeah the Quest 2 is even better
[04:30:08] <nomagno> Full hand tracking without controllers
[04:30:12] <xsperry> arahael, I mean, with valve index you need to have controller in your hand to get hand tracking

[04:40:38] <droid3> let get back to programming talk. So what do you guys like to practice branchless programming or branch programming :)
[04:40:40] <arahael> kennyd: We already have two "international" sign languages, with reasonable takeup.
[04:40:40] <nomagno> Every language morphs with time, and languages drift if there is isolation between communities
[04:41:04] <droid3> by branch i mean using if , if else , switch ,... control structures
[04:42:16] <nomagno> droid3: you can't program a lot of stuff without control structures! Even purely functional languages RISC instruction sets have them

[04:44:29] <droid3> nomagno that not fully true its just cumbersome and usually more complex statements confuse the compiler optimization making them more time consuming runtimes in the long run.

[04:46:15] <arahael> ircuser: I have a friend who's blind in one eye.  And he's a freaking driver.
[04:46:17] <droid3> Actually if you use branchless programming correctly you can speed up your program over the branched versions. Sometimes however most compiler optimizers handle this pretty well. And you only be screwing up the compiler optimization process thus making it slow.
[04:46:22] <arahael> ircuser: It's seriously not an issue. It's just one eye.
[04:46:28] <ircuser> ok

[04:47:25] <ejjfunky> droid3: I rather use branch. It's still easier to read and if you do it right, it's almost as efficient as branchless.

[04:48:02] <ejjfunky> efficient doesn't just running the application but also programmer's productivity.
[04:48:04] <droid3> ejjfunky not disagreeing with you just find branchless programming kind of a need idea and a good tool to be aware of.
[04:48:06] <ircuser> yes I know technically they can program but I'm wondering if visual impairment should be factored into the decision
[04:48:11] <kennyd> it would be an advantage compared to blind programmers (they exist)
[04:48:36] <ircuser> kennyd: thanks. its a progressive disease so this is what im getting at
[04:48:38] <ejjfunky> so, unless you're working on your own, then i don't think the performance gain is almost as important as the team productivity that you get
[04:48:44] <ircuser> not sure what part of this is a troll?
[04:48:48] <ircuser> im kind of offended
[04:49:03] <ejjfunky> well, depending on the problem you are working too
[04:49:03] <dan01[m]> Guys....
[04:49:05] <nomagno> Blind programming doesn't sound that bad with a proper screen reader. I don't see it viable as a profession, but I'm sure a lot of people have proven me wrong already
[04:49:05] <arahael> ircuser: Your stance here is what we call "Ablist".
[04:49:07] <droid3> Also in the passed did a program that would unroll every loop statement. And test the difference in performance but it only worked for reasonable iterated loops as the file size gets huge.
[04:49:11] <ircuser> they'll need to consider all these factors in their decision as programming isn't their only option (they have many)
[04:49:16] <dan01[m]> Does Firefox have hardware video decoding on Linux?
[04:49:25] <arahael> "Ableist", rather.
[04:49:27] <ejjfunky> but the best way is to test and time your app. if it's considerable, then you can use it. but for most of the time, branch is good enough
[04:49:33] <droid3> The program does perform faster but for the issues/space/ speedup its not really significant.
[04:49:58] <ejjfunky> what i can think of is, when it's comes to real time functions. and that's only the ones that are necessary to get the most performance
[04:50:19] <droid3> I had a unrolling the loops program that when over and generated the unrolled loop equivalent program it looks ridiculous though LOL but cool 
[04:50:22] <ejjfunky> but other peripheral/secondary functions, we don't really need them
[04:51:05] <nomagno> most of your time programming is spent thinking how to make something without blowing up the codebase into a code smell garbage. A fraction of the remaining time is spent on keystrokes
[04:51:30] <droid3> in theory unrolled loops and branchless programs is probably more optimal when you can do it. But for the slight performance difference with optimal compilers i see it just making your life difficult. Most case 
[04:51:45] <arahael> nomagno: Oh, oh man.  What's even worse? Maybe it's a temporary glitch, but clicking through and viewing your terms and conditions...

[05:15:41] <arahael> [itchyjunk]: You need to put that into context of your employed salary and job prospects.  But if that's too high, then yeah. Move. But be sure to move to a place that has good job prospects.
[05:15:46] <[itchyjunk]> People who already had a lot of $ invested in a lot of properties and since it's doing so well, it's stuck like that

[05:16:11] <jkk> no

[05:17:20] <[itchyjunk]> I know a few property owner who just hold without renters.
[05:17:23] <arahael> Many property owners don't regard the rental income as worth any difficulty or drama a renter can cause.

[05:20:38] <[itchyjunk]> arahael, there was an "nice area" ~1 hr from where i am and the houses were ~200k there post housing crisis
[05:20:45] <[itchyjunk]> they are all above $1M currently
[05:20:51] <[itchyjunk]> so there is some extreme examples too
[05:20:56] <arahael> [itchyjunk]: My area is all above $2M.
[05:20:57] <[itchyjunk]> but forget those houses
[05:21:04] <[itchyjunk]> damn, you must live in a nice place
[05:21:30] <[itchyjunk]> in any case, there is no hope of purchasing property for now even if i land a decent job ;_;
[05:21:33] <arahael> [itchyjunk]: I do, but it's also 10 minutes from my office, and 20 from the wife's workplace.  Again, you need to put housing costs against income costs.
[05:22:04] <[itchyjunk]> median income is ~60k in usa and house cost ~$350k i think
[05:22:15] *** Joins: rvalue (~rvalue@user/rvalue)
[05:22:29] <arahael> [itchyjunk]: That's median, though. You need to look at the suburb profile for the specific neighbourhood you're in.

[05:22:35] <dan01> it was disabled

[05:22:49] <[itchyjunk]> arahael, what does that do?
[05:23:08] <[itchyjunk]> looking at someone elses income doesn't change the cost in a city area
[05:23:24] <[itchyjunk]> local city influences all it's sorrunding suburb prices
[05:23:26] <arahael> [itchyjunk]: It gives context, your median is too broad, it'll include poor areas with poor job prospects and rich areas with good job prospects, and also holiday areas full of retirees who have money to splurge.
[05:23:33] <[itchyjunk]> regardless of local suburb median income
[05:24:51] <arahael> [itchyjunk]: My particular area is full of either university students (with wealthy parents), or professionals who can easily typically probably put $40k/year into their property.

[05:25:59] <[itchyjunk]> i looked it up ~3 months ago.
[05:26:12] <[itchyjunk]> That's not due to local median income values
[05:26:24] <arahael> Probably due to land prices overall.
[05:26:27] <[itchyjunk]> there is too much investment in properties from people with $
[05:26:52] <[itchyjunk]> Land prices don't go up that quick in US far enough away from cities
[05:27:03] <arahael> [itchyjunk]: You also have people who can do remote work realising that they can move out.  And they have money to burn.
[05:27:04] <[itchyjunk]> USA has a lot of land and sure city land is premium
[05:27:41] <arahael> [itchyjunk]: Anyway.  Graduate.  Get a reasonable job.  Then consider your options.  And in all likelihood, you'll do best finding a reaosnable place to rent.
[05:28:01] <arahael> brb - taking the garbage out...
[05:28:25] <[itchyjunk]> Idk, i'll probably have to rent. But ~1800 - 2k for single bedroom sounds like extortion to me.

[05:38:50] <arahael> We refused when they bumped the price up to $470, though, laughted at them, and bought an apartment. The place was vacant for the next year or so.  They tried to exploit us, I think, and it backfired on them.
[05:39:13] <arahael> But sadly, most renters aren't in that position.
[05:41:13] <[itchyjunk]> arahael, 2k usd is 2.8k aud

[09:00:26] <d3x0r> ya ;) I get that
[09:00:47] <newpy> so every 4 bytes are swapped into "reverse" order
[09:01:03] <d3x0r> at a high level it's reversed byte order not bits - bits are still in bit order... the one that's '1' as a value is still that bit

[09:01:16] <d3x0r> from a start
[09:01:59] <d3x0r> if ou have a uint16 that's just 2; if its a 64 it's 8... float 32/64...
[09:02:15] <d3x0r> and the first byte is always the lowest value of the series
[09:02:48] <ircuser> computers are so dumb for doing that

[12:15:45] <pyzozord> ooh you know what else? this game is about fallig and avoiding obstacles. So there is a only a very specific time window and specific input that will not kill you, that will also make it much harder to chest because you need to send the right data at the right time

[12:17:32] <mrig> amigojapan ah so you are working on a new system?

[12:43:08] <mrig> Which could be kept on github, but it would not have persistence.
[12:43:29] <Raziel> amigojapan, wouldn't that probably be more expensive than a home internet plan? I guess it does depend on your location but
[12:43:29] <average> Raziel: a NAS does solve the problem of needing internet. I haven't found a good full-text search software package yet, Recoll might be one, then maybe Xapian would work too, but it's not as good as I wanted it to be
[12:43:41] <average> Raziel: so.. storing inordinate amounts of things offline can work. 
[12:44:08] <Raziel> average, to some extent it could, but, doesn't feel like it would for long
[12:44:21] <average> Raziel: it can.. for long..
[12:44:34] <Raziel> different usecases too I suppose
[12:44:49] <amigojapan> Raziel: I pay 100usd for unlimited data on my phone at 250kbps, per *YEAR*
[12:45:07] <average> Raziel: then there's also web archiving software, and that can help with fetching the news at a given time of day and archiving everything. in fact, that's really the only thing you'd need internet for..
[12:45:19] <d3x0r> sqlite has FTS
[12:45:39] <Raziel> amigojapan, that's not bad, except 250kbps would probably make me stab someone just so I can get locked up in a prison with better internet than that

[12:46:20] <d3x0r> certainly
[12:46:21] <Raziel> average, yeah, definitely different usecases
[12:46:34] <average> Raziel: so what's your usecase then ?
[12:46:43] <Raziel> amigojapan, I don't either generally,‭ I prefer downloading them and storing them on my big nas. but, like, I still wouldn't be happy about taking a month to download one movie or such
[12:47:10] <Raziel> average, anything that expects you to have internet for things like updates, finding or getting new things, communication
[12:47:32] <Raziel> how am I supposed to get the new and improved version of this library I've archived without internet? :p
[12:47:33] <average> Raziel: you can get 1 month of home internet, download like 500 movies, and then watch those over the next 8-9 months while you do offline
[12:48:00] <Raziel> average, you could, but that would cost more upfront in hdds than the internet for 8-9 months would 
[12:48:04] <Raziel> by several orders of magnitude
[12:48:07] <average> Raziel: why you need bleeding edge libraries when you're offline? ain't nobody gonna hack you offline..
[12:48:09] <amigojapan> Raziel: I can't legally download pirated things anyway since Japan really is cracking down on that. 2 years in prison for downloading 10 years for uploading
[12:48:23] <Raziel> average, because I make production software on here? :p
[12:48:40] <Raziel> amigojapan, not necessarily pirated, but that is a big oof
[12:49:04] <amigojapan> Raziel: we still have DVD rentals here, and they are cheap
[12:49:13] <Raziel> average, think of it this way, 1gbps internet here is $10 a month
[12:49:14] <Raziel> v:
[12:49:24] <average> Raziel: I'll tell you exactly how much the HDDs would cost you: $1000 for 12TB storage in 2019, probably much more cheaper now
[12:49:40] <Raziel> average, a 18tb hdd is about $400 now, yes
[12:49:45] <Raziel> I have a few 16tb ones. they are full.
[12:49:46] <Raziel> -.-
[12:50:03] <average> I'm stuck with my old 12TB = 4 disks x 3TB each
[12:50:03] <Raziel> $400 is still 40 months of internets here
[12:50:33] <average> Raziel: I still don't get why you need internet to develop software. Even stackoverflow is downloadable in Kiwix format and you can read it offline..
[12:50:48] <average> the entirety of stackexchange is also available for download
[12:51:34] <Raziel> I suppose downloading the entirety of that would remove one thing that you usually need the internet for. downloading the entirety of github could remove another, for a time at least
[12:51:37] <average> Raziel: yes, 1gbps internet is $10/month, but how much time is wasted when one has access to internet..
[12:52:03] <average> Raziel: uhm, I wouldn't download all of github, just some repos off of it
[12:53:14] <average> Raziel: there is a point in writing code offline. for example if you write code offline, you force yourself to know exactly what you're doing. you know you don't have Google anymore.. so you need to actually use a much smaller and limited knowledge base..
[12:53:21] <Raziel> average, I do also use the internet to, yknow, communicate with people. get help with things. talk to team members. talk to clients. talk to my friends. play vidya games. shitpost on #C++

[13:02:51] <Raziel> now, if I were spending all my time just shitposting on irc and not getting any work done, it would be an issue

[13:27:02] <Raziel> the android app isn't too bad, last I checked. but I do tend to use the pc apps more
[13:27:04] <Gamah> so "step over" means.... "come back out of lower scopes back to this scope" and not.."don't execute the next call" right?
[13:27:05] <arahael> Raziel: And VRChat, the setup I want to use, is still missing functionality that the platform has had for a year.
[13:27:07] <Gamah> in a debugger.
[13:27:07] <Raziel> which are also not too bad
[13:27:32] <arahael> Raziel: Oh, speaking of the 'pc apps', I don't have windows.
[13:27:39] <d3x0r> step over yes goes over the next line - though if there's mulitple calls it will step over all of those on a line
[13:28:01] <Gamah> d3x0r: so "next line in the current scope" is the right way to feel it?
[13:28:06] <d3x0r> ya
[13:28:07] *** Parts: mickey8 (~user@user/mickey) ()
[13:28:13] <Raziel> Gamah, right, it goes to the next line (in the current scope) but still executes anything in between
[13:28:20] <Gamah> is that the most common button when using breakpoints? or am i debugging wrong?
[13:28:25] <Raziel> I dun think there's normally any way to tell it to skip *executing* some piece of code
[13:28:42] <d3x0r> yes that's pretty common.  occasionally you step into and then step out so you can get that second call on a line
[13:28:43] <Gamah> i also have "step into" and "step out of" in vscode
[13:28:49] <Gamah> hm...
[13:28:50] <arahael> You can move the instruction pointer, but...  Given modern compilers will re-order your instructions, that will have very surprising results.
[13:28:51] <d3x0r> (or like multiple functiosn called to get arguments to another function)
[13:29:03] <Gamah> arahael: lol
[13:29:33] <Gamah> so step over is what i really want
[13:29:40] <d3x0r> generally
[13:29:48] <Gamah> much better....

[13:30:25] <Gamah> i thought steamVR was supported on linux?
[13:31:10] <amigojapan> Gamah: to make it easy to understand use step over a function call or you will be taken to see it's implementation
[13:31:13] <arahael> Gamah: I have macOS, my linux box doesn't have a graphics card (beyond the integrated intel)
[13:31:27] <Raziel> Gamah, steamvr on linux works to soooome extent
[13:31:41] <Raziel> but probably not with oculus because you'd also need oculus' layers
[13:31:46] <Gamah> i haven't tried yet but i do want to get beat saber working on linux

[13:32:39] <arahael> I'm old school. :(
[13:32:43] <Gamah> arahael: not gonna lie.... my understanding of macos vs linux today is "if you build it on macos everything just works" is that not the case?
[13:33:09] <amigojapan> Hopefully we can beat the "there are no good games on Linux"excuse some day
[13:33:15] <arahael> Gamah: The macos instructions, where they exist, is typically: Download this. Install windows in a bootcamp..."
[13:33:23] <Gamah> amigojapan: there's plenty of good games working on linux
[13:33:30] <pulse> There are good games on Linux, unfortunately most of them are less stable than on Windows, lol
[13:33:31] <Gamah> dota, csgo, overwatch, rocket league, etc etc...
[13:33:35] <Raziel> arahael, I suppose windows in bootcamp would work
[13:33:42] <Raziel> yeah.

[13:34:00] <Raziel> oof.
[13:34:18] <pulse> It's hard to get stuff working on Linux. Half of my GoG library "supports" Linux, yet I can only get a handful of them actually working
[13:34:25] <pulse> And even those that do work sometimes have game breaking bugs
[13:34:28] <Gamah> pulse: everything i've gotten to work on linux this year performs better than on windows, except for the lack of shader cache because of nvidia's stupid driver roadblock
[13:34:38] <pulse> Or just annoyances like cutscenes being all green and similar weirdness
[13:34:49] <pulse> Gamah, That has not been my experience at all
[13:34:52] <Gamah> pulse: you want lutris and steam's proton thing
[13:35:26] <pulse> I've heard those are problematic in some instances too
[13:35:28] <mrig> I've got some bugs on my linux install to work through, really bad ones, but am on windows for most of my work at them moment and simply do not have the time to address them.

[13:46:41] <Gamah> i used to call my blog "one for the day"
[13:47:24] <lockywolf> In C++, when I write `a = b;` , which "copy constructor" is called? a's or b's ?
[13:47:32] <mrig> ah, thought of the day, that sort of thing.
[13:47:54] <Gamah> lockywolf: pretty sure b will be copied onto A
[13:48:33] <Gamah> you wouldn't make a copy of a just to overwrite it with whatever b is
[13:48:39] <lockywolf> Gamah, and?
[13:48:52] <Gamah> i dunno, i thought i answered the question
[13:49:19] <lockywolf> I thought that a "copy constructor" is what called "instead of overwriting".
[13:49:27] <lockywolf> "make a be like b"
[13:49:35] <lockywolf> That's why it is copying.
[13:49:39] <Gamah> i guess you could debug to see what happens
[13:49:41] <Raziel> a copy constructor takes a const ref to the same type and modifies the current instance to match that ref
[13:49:50] <Raziel> so yes, a's copy constructor is called, to make a be like b

[13:51:15] <lockywolf> to be honest, I'd be pretty happy to "just overwrite a"

[13:51:34] <Raziel> well, that is what it does in the end either way

[14:24:33] <arahael> A user removable battery, not a "dismantle the laptop first", but properly user removable.
[14:25:21] <CaCode-> If you are gonna type for living more or less, what difference does it make to get a cheap mechanical keyboard compared to one of those US$ 20 mouse and keyboard combos?

[14:26:17] <arahael> CaCode-: Honestly? "It feels better", but no, not really.  I like the tactile feedback, but you get that with most laptop-style keyboards as well, though with significantly shorter travel.

[14:26:56] <CaCode-> oh pulse I understand
[14:27:26] <pulse> It's funny how when a guitarist buys a $5000 guitar nobody bats an eye. When a car enthusiast spends $30k on exhaust system everyone applauds. When a yo-yo champion spends $3000 on a perfect yo-yo everyone is happy
[14:27:35] <pulse> But god forbid a professional programmer spends $300 for a keyboard, LOL
[14:27:38] <pulse> That's too much
[14:27:39] <[itchyjunk]> it doesn't seem to have a user removable one
[14:27:45] <arahael> CaCode-: Your typing and comfort and everything will improve if you are happy with the setup and the setup is pleasant to use, so I would personally recommend getting a good mechanical keyboard. But I don't think it's objectively better.
[14:27:52] <pulse> CaCode-, They are just better. End of story
[14:28:00] <[itchyjunk]> if it was battery issue, it would work when plugged in right?
[14:28:00] <arahael> [itchyjunk]: Is the laptop particularly hot?
[14:28:14] <arahael> [itchyjunk]: If it's a battery issue...  Depends on the laptop.
[14:28:17] <CaCode-> pulse I agree, but one has to keep in mind sometimes expensive is neccessary but not a sufficient condition for a better piece of equipment
[14:28:18] <[itchyjunk]> Not currently, i was last using it early when i talked here
[14:28:38] <pulse> CaCode-, If you can't afford it, then save money until you can
[14:28:39] <CaCode-> pulse you convinced me i am ordering one
[14:28:52] <pulse> CaCode-, Be mindful of switches, they aren't all alike
[14:28:53] <arahael> [itchyjunk]: Have you been charging it for a while? It could well be too flat.
[14:29:25] <arahael> CaCode-: Yeah - my keyboard - a Filco mechanical keyboard, is quite nice but the quality seems to be shockingly bad once you get below the key switches themselves.
[14:29:25] <pulse> Also mechanical keyboards last an eternity. I have 2 and I clean them every few months or so. My 6 year old mech is like new. You couldn't tell it wasn't new when I'm done cleaning it
[14:29:47] <[itchyjunk]> i had left it on charge for ~10 hours yesterday
[14:29:51] <[itchyjunk]> while i was using it yes
[14:29:52] <pulse> CaCode-, Research switches before you make a purchase. Some are tactile, some are linear, some are better for typing, other are better for gaming. Some are loud, some aren't. Etc.
[14:29:54] <arahael> pulse: Yeah. I've gone through two filco's already. :(
[14:29:55] <[itchyjunk]> what does flat mean?
[14:29:58] <GeDaMo> My keyboard is going to be 30 next year :P
[14:30:03] <[itchyjunk]> all my code is in there
[14:30:08] <[itchyjunk]> one that's due tuesday
[14:30:08] <arahael> [itchyjunk]: I think americans use the term "dead battery"?
[14:30:11] <[itchyjunk]> one that i haven't ifnished
[14:30:34] <[itchyjunk]> dead battery can make it not have charging indecator light or start at all while connected to a charger?
[14:30:39] <CaCode-> [itchyjunk], i may be mistaken but it is my impression that laptop batteries are just a series of 18650 batteries soldered to gether with a pcb to control them to not overcharge and so forth. if you got soldering iron and such you can order new bats and replace the old ones...
[14:31:02] <CaCode-> it is some what of a risky procedure if you do not have spot welding equipment but i am not an expert or knowledgable
[14:31:12] <[itchyjunk]> i have to work on my final project and part of it is due on tuesday
[14:31:14] <d3x0r> rarely soldered... they usually have connectors
[14:31:23] <[itchyjunk]> ordering soldering iron and fixing a laptop is not an option
[14:31:29] <CaCode-> pulse which ones do you recomend for typing
[14:31:31] <arahael> CaCode-: And these days rarely just 18650 batteries.
[14:31:34] <pulse> [itchyjunk], You can typically recover stuff from a laptop until the SSD/HDD is soldered on
[14:31:35] <GeDaMo> Does the uni have any tech support?
[14:31:48] <[itchyjunk]> yes but it's weekend
[14:32:02] <[itchyjunk]> sounds like im fucked
[14:32:20] <[itchyjunk]> i `think` i made a ticket for the issue
[14:32:24] <[itchyjunk]> and emailed the prof
[14:32:25] <GeDaMo> Ask in #hardware, maybe they'll have some suggestions
[14:32:27] <[itchyjunk]> but it's 3am
[14:32:37] <pulse> CaCode-, Cherry blues are defacto typist switches. But they are LOUD. Cherry browns are good for both typing and gaming, and they're considerably quieter. Those are both tactile. Then you have linear switches like red, black, etc. And you have a bunch of non-Cherry switches. It's best if you type something like "types of mechanical keyboard switches" on google and youtube and see what the recommendations are
[14:32:46] <[itchyjunk]> can't believe piece of shit device died on me
[14:32:52] <pulse> Chances are you won't like blues because they are loud. I like them myself and they're super comfortable for typing
[14:33:19] <pulse> In general I recommend Cherry browns for first time mechanical users
[14:33:27] <CaCode-> pulse i will just go with your suggestion
[14:33:34] <GeDaMo> It might not be the battery, is it possible you've disabled the screen?
[14:33:47] <CaCode-> my housing situation is so loud i have earplugs 7/24 anyways...
[14:34:16] <bjs> You can also get "silent" cherry switches, which are good
[14:34:25] <pulse> You can also go full retro and get a Unicomp
[14:34:39] <CoderGuy> when it comes to removing duplicates from an array what is the best approach? could also be a string considering i'm splitting it into an array
[14:34:42] <pulse> Although real Model Ms are supposedly higher quality
[14:35:05] <pulse> CoderGuy, The best approach is to not push duplicates into the array to begin with :P
[14:35:17] <CoderGuy> pulse well it starts a string that i'm splitting...
[14:35:29] <CoderGuy> via deliminator so semi colon ;
[14:35:33] <[itchyjunk]> no
[14:35:38] <[itchyjunk]> the power button does nothing
[14:36:00] <[itchyjunk]> it doesn't turn on off either
[14:36:06] <[itchyjunk]> which is weird because i thought i shut it down
[14:36:09] <[itchyjunk]> before the battery died
[14:36:24] <[itchyjunk]> how the fuck can it go from working to completely dead on my like this
[14:36:27] <CoderGuy> so like i'm not sure how I would do this other then maybe building an array & then checking the string for a duplicate everytime?
[14:36:48] <average> [itchyjunk]: get a thinkpad itchy, it's reliable
[14:36:49] *** Joins: rvalue (~rvalue@user/rvalue)
[14:37:00] <average> 2nd and it's still reliable
[14:37:00] <CoderGuy> but isn't that technically the same thing, like if I loop on every entry attempt versus loop over all the entries?
[14:37:12] <average> [itchyjunk]: you're in the greatest country in teh world, a thinkpad is cheap off of ebay
[14:37:39] * arahael looks at average. "Greatest"?
[14:37:47] <CoderGuy> so for example apple;pear;banana;apple;pear;plum;apple;banana;plum;pear;peach
[14:38:06] <CoderGuy> and then if I loop everytime through the created array
[14:38:09] <average> arahael: was I supposed to say "China is the greatest, long live Xi Jinping" ?
[14:38:32] <arahael> average: Difficult to tell these days.
[14:38:46] <average> arahael: anyways my point is he has ebay and they'll ship it to his door
[14:39:12] <CoderGuy> [peach] pear (loops over peach 1 time) [peach][pear] plum loops over entries so 2 checks. banana 3 checks apple 4 checks plum hits hmmm
[14:39:51] <CoderGuy> so that versus the whole thing we check apple for uniques, we check pear for uniques wait
[14:39:59] <arahael> [itchyjunk]: Given it's 3am as you say, perhaps the best thing you can do is get a couple of hours sleep, and see if the laptop revives in the morning. If it does, back that damn thing up so you still have your assignment.

[14:40:04] <CoderGuy> omg it's the same thing
[14:40:28] <CoderGuy> in order to check for duplicates you have to build an array that tells you if you have a duplicate or not, thus building said array when splitting is probably better
[14:40:32] <arahael> [itchyjunk]: And if the uni has computer labs, perhaps spend some time in there.
[14:41:15] <CoderGuy> is that logical or is there some magic you can do for duplicate checking?

[14:43:34] <[itchyjunk]> maybe for ms word
[14:43:46] <CoderGuy> right right so then [a,0][b,0][c,0][a,0][b,0][c,0][a,0][b,0][c,0]  becomes [a,0][b,0][c,0][a,1][b,0][c,0][a,1][b,0][c,0]  and then you skip over the ones marked for removal until you reach the end

[14:44:09] <average> [itchyjunk] is the perfect student
[14:44:15] <[itchyjunk]> i did do it once i was done with last week checkpoint

[14:44:32] <[itchyjunk]> generally do it around that time

[14:45:35] <average> so how are you online now?
[14:45:38] <average> on your phone or what?
[14:45:50] <[itchyjunk]> oh my shitty laptop that can't run eclipse
[14:45:58] <CoderGuy> yeah cuz a mark for removal would only check 1 time, but without marking for removal you're checking yeah like the whole array could be looped multiple times
[14:46:02] <[itchyjunk]> that's why i borrowed the uni laptop 
[14:46:18] <CoderGuy> and then you skip on the mark for removal many loops of the array
[14:46:39] <arahael> [itchyjunk]: Does it have eclipse, though, even if you can't run it?
[14:46:46] <CoderGuy> pulse so although you're right in if we do nothing it's fastest, actually looping through after adding everything via a split is magically faster
[14:46:49] <[itchyjunk]> yes
[14:47:04] <CoderGuy> becauseee you can mark for removal & then skip
[14:47:40] <arahael> [itchyjunk]: You could probably use a regular text editor (notepad++ is popular on windows), and do your builds on the command line.
[14:48:05] <[itchyjunk]> the project has 30 class and weird eclipse hierarchy structures
[14:48:18] <[itchyjunk]> people using intellij have been struggling with class requirement heh
[14:48:37] <[itchyjunk]> i think my best bet is to wait till monday and see if they can recover my thing for me
[14:48:41] <[itchyjunk]> and give me a new machine..

[14:49:49] <[itchyjunk]> in case i need a little time
[14:50:10] <CoderGuy> but then, the question is since you're looping 7 times, over every single item so say length 10 that would be 70 checks, versus 10 checks 1 time iterating over a uniquely built list lets say the list gets full after the first 7 entries, so 3 * 7 is already 24 hmm

[15:08:41] <CoderGuy> yeah so we use the array split that is being built & then utilize that for duplicates
[15:08:55] <CoderGuy> and viola we do everything all at the same time, and apparently it's either the same speed or faster
[15:10:05] <CoderGuy> so for example something simple like a;b;b;a;b  would become 1)[a] 2) [a][b]  and then it does the checks but never adds step 3 it checks itself 4 checks itself & apparently that's the same amount of checks as if we split everything, loop over everything & remove stuff inbetween

[15:19:45] <CoderGuy> Daemonick, if that's true, then why are my duplicate check methods the same?
[15:20:22] <Daemonick> I don't get you CoderGuy
[15:20:31] <CoderGuy> Daemonick, answer me this, why is building a unique list that you check against every single entry the same amount of checks as looping over the same list multiple times but marking for deletion the duplicates on each loop?
[15:21:02] <CoderGuy> Example lets say we have a list [a][b][c][a][b][c]
[15:21:18] <Daemonick> and?
[15:22:28] <CoderGuy> why is it, if I build a unique list so 1) create list [a] 2) check for B, up add B to list [a][b] 3) check list for C, up doens't exist add C to list [a][b][c] 4) check whole list...etc for 5 and 6
[15:22:47] <pyzozord> I have to say that aoc + python is taking me 3 hours instead of 30 minutes
[15:23:30] <GeDaMo> Is that because you're having to lookup the Python documentation?
[15:23:55] <CoderGuy> why is that the same amount of checks as 1) get a, check everything and mark the A's for deletion so [a,0][b,0][c,0][a,1][b,0][c,0] 2) start at B check everything mark b's for deletion [a,0][b,0][c,0][a,1][b,1][c,0] 3) [a,0][b,0][c,0][a,1][b,1][c,1]
[15:24:01] <Daemonick> Sorry guys but I cannot grasp you
[15:24:36] <pyzozord> GeDaMo: yes, also because I get hang up on things assuming they work one way, but they work different way in python
[15:24:37] <CoderGuy> okay 1 method we build a list and check said list against everything, the other method we loop through the entire list & mark the duplicates for deletion & the result is the same exact amount of checks
[15:24:49] <CoderGuy> when trying to find duplicates in a list, why is it the same thing?

[15:25:55] <CoderGuy> so the goal is to go from a list like [a][b][c][a][b][c] to [a][b][c]
[15:26:19] <CoderGuy> and there are 2 methods for removing duplicates, either loop over the entire list & mark the duplicate entries for removal, OR make a unique list & check it against every single entry
[15:26:29] <CoderGuy> and low & behold it's the same amount of checks both ways

[15:27:09] <CoderGuy> Daemonick, now you claim you should learn from a book, so i'm asking you, why are these 2 methods the same?
[15:27:23] *** Quits: zer0bitz (~zer0bitz@dsl-hkibng32-54fbfb-173.dhcp.inet.fi) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[15:28:19] <CoderGuy> you'd think like "okay if we have to loop through the list multiple times, clearly that's more" or maybe "okay if we have to loop over the unique list for every entry, maybe that's more" but actually it's the same
[15:28:43] <CoderGuy> so why is it the same is my question
[15:29:38] <pyzozord> I just have troubles with "how do I chunk string into 2-long substrings in python" and get hang up on this for 15 minutes or more, because it feels like python should be able to do it better. And I do it uncessairly because I used .split(' ') which gives me some empty strings as opposed to .split() which would give no empty string and I wouldn't need to worry about chunking. So wasting 15-20 
[15:29:44] <pyzozord> mintues on simple things like this
[15:29:54] <CoderGuy> is it that somehow when you build the unique list, it simulates the same checks as when you look over THE ENTIRE LIST per entry because somehow when you then skip going over the entire list, maybe that's it
[15:30:08] <pyzozord> also python documentation doesn't seem to be the best to be honest
[15:30:20] <pyzozord> it's written too much like a book and not enough as reference
[15:30:31] <CoderGuy> yeah maybe like, by skipping duplicately going over the list, simply looping through a unique list for every entry is the same

[15:32:39] <GeDaMo> pyzozord: one of the advantages of an interpreted language is it's easy to test out if things work the way you think they should
[15:32:46] <CoderGuy> but what we're left with is, since they're the same might as well use the unique list for building the duplicates, as that's just resource savvy

[19:52:01] <pulse> Where I work we have one enormous XML with legacy data and it's so horrendous everyone just fetches data by literally getting a specific line

[22:15:26] <newpy> I think e9 is jump and fffd is -3, so if the first instruction takes up address 0, 1, & 2, then jumping -3 from the next instruction would take us back to 0?

[23:16:01] <alguien> 2021-08-07 <alguien> Here's the plan, guys. A new cross-platform framework for mobile development. But only for iOS. How is that cross-platform you ask? Easy, the API is the Android SDK. We write apps for native Android and it works on iOS. That's the only reason we use cross-platform tools anyway, to support iOS users. Of course, due to the translation layer, it won't work as well on iOS as it does on Android. That's a good thing. People stop using 
[23:16:01] <alguien> iOS on account on
