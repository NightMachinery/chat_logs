[00:00:12] <magnus1> seems like a nifty feature, if the os support it :) 
[00:01:11] <magnus1> the "bios" of this laptop is so minimal. there's virtually no advanced settings to make. perhaps i can manipulate the efi settings from linux? im no efi expert, but seen you can edit efi variables from using linux tools

[01:50:12] <OneDev> You might just have set keyboard as the last hook in the mkinicpio.conf which would mean that all things including mount need to happen before your keyboard becomes available. 
[01:50:15] <chazy> if a system doesn't have swap, why does it hang when an app tries to use as much ram as possible?
[01:50:46] <lgflorentino> Hi Could somebody help me figure out when a package in commmunity-staging is going to hit community ?
[01:50:51] <chazy> i mean is that considered a bug? shouldn't the kernel handle properly memory usage so that running apps can make full use of it without hanging?
[01:51:01] <OneDev> However once the damn system is take the handling of IRQ your keyboard should be available no matter what is in the initramfs as it will be handled by kernel.

[01:55:08] <nyloc> Hi, bluetooth suddenly stopped working on my Lenovo X1 Extreme gen1. I read something about bluetooth issues with Kernel 5.15.x and 5.16.0 but I am now running 5.16.2, rfkill shows my bluetooth device as unblocked, but bluetoothctl list returns an empty list, any hints where else to look, or do I have to downgrade to 5.14.x Kernel?

[04:21:34] <Namarrgon> Hydragyrum: of course, that's how the official packages are built. ideally you would use a chroot though, so the result doesn't get polluted by the environment.
[04:21:53] <fenugrec> if the machines are otherwise identical (same cpu arch, not compiling with -mnative), same versions of dependencies

[05:27:05] <NetSysFire> !Syyu
[05:27:06] <phrik> The double yy in `pacman -Syyu` is almost never needed. If you're switching to a mirror that uses an older copy of the repos, see !Syyuu instead. Unless your repo databases are completely corrupted, force-downloading already-up-to-date ones accomplishes nothing other than to waste bandwidth and server load. Do your part in conserving the internet, and avoid Syyu!
[05:27:08] <anthony_> I would like to keep the rest of my system up to date
[05:27:20] <NetSysFire> there is IgnorePkg= but this is technically a partial update and not supported

[07:26:11] <kulak> Here is what made me to get concerned: This situation sometimes locks down the normal rolling update process by unsatisfied dependencies because the new kernel version, proposed by update, is unsupported by ZFSonLinux.
[07:26:46] <Scimmia> if you use the -lts kernel, you should be fine

[21:23:53] <grawity> I think you still want --raid-devices=2, but specify 'missing' as the 2nd disk

[22:50:18] <nicholaus04> Although, since i installed my base machine via archinstall, and chose not to use GRUB, i had to edit my *-linux.conf file to use the kernel image and initramfs files for the zen kernel.
[22:51:09] <nicholaus04> Don't worry, i chose the minimal preset, meaning i had to set up my X11 crud from scratch. (And wasn't mad about it.)

[23:01:28] <TheDcoder> Is archinstall officially supported now?

[23:04:19] <TheDcoder> snap
[23:04:26] <TheDcoder> got it
[23:04:32] <Namarrgon> that approach has the same problems as all the other install scripts, it dumps newbies into an environment they didn't set up, don't understand and can't help debug

[23:04:55] <nicholaus04> Then again, the only gripe i have about it was both manual and archinstall did get GRUB installed, but would not even detect my primary partition. So for archinstall, i chose NOT to install GRUB.
[23:04:58] *** Quits: Iamthehuman1 (~noname@user/iamthehuman) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[23:05:14] <Namarrgon> and then there's the bugs, too :p
[23:05:34] <nicholaus04> But other than that, it's perfect. But if you still want flexibility, then installing arch the old fashioned way is still recommended.
[23:05:42] <BrainDamage> part of the installation is making informed choices about your setup, even "wrong" choices are still choices
[23:05:56] <BrainDamage> which you have to know when debugging issues
[23:05:58] <TheDcoder> Namarrgon: I agree
[23:06:12] <TheDcoder> there's bugs? Is archinstall still in beta?
[23:06:37] <Namarrgon> the advantage of an official installer is that we have at least a rough idea of what it's doing

[23:14:04] <Mathisen> how did you list all installed packages from AUR again ?

[23:14:58] <nicholaus04> Oh, the dedication.
