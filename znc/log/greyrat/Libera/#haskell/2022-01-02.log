[00:13:45] <euouae> is join "running" the effects?

[00:14:14] <int-e> (just checking)
[00:14:16] <Rembane> The runtime system takes care of executing the effects in IO. 
[00:14:22] <Rembane> IIRC
[00:14:24] <euouae> How do you read that type and understand sequencing?
[00:14:38] <euouae> what is an effect?
[00:14:51] <int-e> :t join -- yes, join also sequences two effects; f >>= g = join (g <$> f)  after all
[00:14:52] <lambdabot> Monad m => m (m a) -> m a
[00:15:01] <euouae> I guess `a -> m b` is a computation with an effect, right?
[00:15:18] <int-e> what kind of "effect" you have depends on the monad
[00:15:21] <Rembane> It doesn't have to. Take a look at Data.Maybe. 
[00:15:22] <euouae> and we already have an effect `m a`, so we can continue the chain of computation.

[00:16:11] <int-e> IO is basically the only one with a *real* effect (launching missiles etc)
[00:17:15] <dsal> You can think of ST as closer to State than IO and have a similar mental model.   Might be a good bridge.
[00:17:35] *** Joins: betelgeuse9 (~betelgeus@94-225-47-8.access.telenet.be)
[00:17:50] <dsal> IO has no constrained effects, where State allows you to make arbitrary changes to a specific value.  The ordering of those effects is important.
[00:17:52] <monochrom> Mathematicians study monads in terms of join. But join is not very relatable to programmers. >>= is most relatable, Kleisli arrow is not bad either.

[00:28:18] <EvanR> that doesn't seem like a proper effect xD

[00:28:57] <monochrom> If the answer depends on a hidden datum, that is a little bit effectful.
[00:28:57] <EvanR> that's a weird feature of Reader specifically
[00:29:33] <int-e> reader is fairly useless... except that it allows you to use generic monadic functions; it's a bit more useful as a transformer

[01:10:42] <sclv> the carrot greater eaql means it requires base be somewhere between 4.13 and 4.14 but no higher
[01:10:53] <lechner_> i see!
[01:11:06] <lechner_> it always helps to know the docs

[02:52:34] <kitzman> I see, so I have to create separate types.

[17:43:37] <juri_> instead i have to either change all of my unit tests to use rationals so i can cut and paste (UGH!), or copy and paste the rational to ghci, then get the double from there, and copy and paste that back into my unit tests.
[17:44:33] <juri_> and worse, the "that changed for the better / worse" is now incomprehensible, because i USED to be able to convert the doubles to a rough ratio between them in my head, and know approximately what the structure it was defining meant.
[17:44:43] <juri_> now, the three rationals are three different bases.
[17:44:52] <juri_> this is literally giving me a headache.

[22:20:37] <phma> The program added the numbers starting at 1/1, which I know is imprecise. So I started ghci and entered "sum (map (1/) (map fromInteger [-272400600 .. -1]))".
