[01:02:18] <greycat> if I'm reading this man page correctly, the YoutubeDL.py file is only used when you embed youtube-dl inside a python program, and I'm not sure the shebang is actually used in such a case

[01:04:08] <greycat> *nod* I get that part, but I suspect this YoutubeDL.py file which is *not* in PATH is never meant to be invoked directly from a shell, and the shebang is only there in case some fool tries that

[03:05:27] <jelly> the recipe to do that is roughly
[03:05:31] <jelly> !ssb
[03:05:31] <dpkg> First, check for a backport on <debian-backports>.  If unavailable: 1) Add a deb-src line for sid (not a deb line!); ask me about <deb-src sid> 2) enable debian-backports (see <bdo>) 3) apt update; apt install build-essential; apt build-dep packagename 4) apt -b source packagename 5) dpkg -i packagename-ver.deb  To change compilation options, see <package recompile>; for versions newer than sid see <uupdate>.
[03:05:32] <hesco> sure, thanks, PMT.  My infrastructure is some mix of mostly ubuntu and debian, and I get confused if I am not actually querying the system as to which node is running which os.

[17:02:12] <_AleX_> hi all, i've a problem with dracut on a RPI4. I've made an initramfs with nfs modules, set the good kernel parameters for mount the / over nfs, and configure a nfs server with raspbian system. Dracut waits for /dev/root until timeout, finally drop my a shell, the nfs share is correctly mounted on /sysroot, but the "pivot root" was not made ... any idea ?

[17:07:17] <Khepra> _AleX_: dracut is not typical for debian, initramfs-tools does excelletn job
[17:08:05] <_AleX_> Khepra: yes of course, but "standard" initramfs have issues, for example try a initramfs >500MB

[17:10:08] <_AleX_> Khepra: make a large initrd without dracut : it doesn't work
[17:10:59] <Khepra> I'm not sure what initramfs-tools would have a problem with size, it uses standard cpio tools. but eh.. 500MB initrd? that's... extreme given the purpose of initrd, which is solely, and only (anythign else is abusing it), to find and mount and pivot to rootfs.
[17:11:00] <Blondie101010> why the heck would you do that?

[17:11:44] <_AleX_> why ?
[17:11:47] <Blondie101010> you're defeating init

[17:12:30] <Khepra> _AleX_: because, like I said, the only and ONLY purpose of initramfs is to find, mount and pivot to the rootfs. sure you can "play" with other purposes but that's just... playing
[17:12:39] <Blondie101010> _AleX_: that's not the point
[17:13:25] *** Joins: Proxysna (~Proxysna@62.119.254.142)
[17:13:40] <Khepra> _AleX_: if you want in-memory only OS, it should be fairly easy to write initramfs-tools hooks and scripts to mount rootfs via tmpfs and copy from an initial on-disk image or filesystem
[17:13:53] <Khepra> you absolutely don't need 500MB+ initrd for that
[17:14:23] <_AleX_> Khepra: in absolute, you do want you want after the kernel boot, no ? so why not execute a whole system inside a initramfs ?
[17:14:45] <_AleX_> can be very cool for device like RPI4
[17:14:55] <Khepra> because it's pointless
[17:15:12] <Khepra> you're conflating two seemingly different paradigms. initrd and tmpfs rootfs
[17:16:09] <Khepra> unless of course you want a "been there done that" achievement unlocked, which should be properly defined here: not pivoting to rootfs
[17:16:13] <jelly> _AleX_, initramfs has to be unpacked for that.  Do what livecd/liveusb do instead, squashfs loaded to RAM and pivot root to that
[17:16:30] <Khepra> that's the only description of "iniside initramfs". not pivoting to rootfs, but why would you do that, other than to get the achievement.
[17:16:55] <_AleX_> Khepra: yes and i think it's better to use dracut + squashfs system
[17:17:38] <_AleX_> but before doing that, i'm just trying dracut on RPI4 ... 
[17:17:57] <Khepra> _AleX_: again, what errors does initramfs-tools produce
[17:18:16] <Khepra> though at some point I think this is becoming very noise for #debian, seeing as it's not about debian at all :)
[17:18:28] <jelly> if you try actual Debian we can try to help, or at least point you to #debian-raspberrypi over on irc.oftc.net
[17:20:12] <_AleX_> ok i understand
[17:20:19] <_AleX_> sorry for the noise
[17:21:23] <Khepra> _AleX_: as a side-note, you do not need 500MB+ initrd to load a 700GB (for example) squashfs which is stored in /boot next to the initrd cpio
[17:21:51] <Khepra> which is my point entirely: whatever "inside initramfs" thing you want to do, it can mouont and read stuff outside of the initrd
[17:22:20] <Blondie101010> the point of the initrd is to load the drivers needed to load the FS
[17:22:44] <Khepra> (and since you _have_ to dispatch the initrd cpio somehwere with the kernel vmlinuz ANYWAY, just put your squashfs package next to them, in the same /boot partition
[17:23:03] <_AleX_> Khepra: thank you for the explanation, i don't know you can chain an initrd and a squashfs (on tftp of course) without dracut
[17:23:15] <Khepra> it's not "chaining" in terms of grub's meaning of "chaining"
[17:24:10] <Khepra> the kernel executes /bin/init shell script inside the temporary tmpfs root filesystem it uinpacks from the initrd cpio. that's ALL it does. which means you have full kernel APIs at your disposal, maybe even udev running, so you can moount whatever, from wherever, including a squashfs that's on the same /boot partition and not necessarily embedded inside the initrd cpio
[17:24:45] *** Joins: Iamthehuman1 (~noname@user/iamthehuman)
[17:25:26] <Khepra> dracut is just one tool to prepare the cpio. initramfs-tools another. mkinitrd from alpine yet another. genkernel from gentoo, yet another. and you can always write your own to to whatever crazy thing you want, and get that achievement too :)
[17:26:15] <_AleX_> Khepra: dracut is a very interessing project. Good chances that in the future dracut replace initramfs-tools like systemd have replaced the old init ...
[17:26:20] <Khepra> (or just put an initramfs-tools "script" and "hook" you need to get it to do the job)
[17:26:55] <Khepra> good chances based on what assumption. "If it ain't broken, don't fix it". 
[17:27:21] <_AleX_> :)
[17:28:16] <_AleX_> dracut is hosted on kernel.org so it's an "external part" of the kernel like libpam ?

[18:51:33] <deadrom> Yes, and I don't think they expect me to brute force it back.
[18:51:39] <jhutchins> deadrom: Yeah, there are certain red flags in the interview process.
[18:52:32] <jelly> deadrom, RSA of how many bits?
[18:53:00] <deadrom> But so I don't walk away from this uneducated: the DER file contains what?
[18:53:23] <jelly> might be anything
[18:53:46] <deadrom> jelly: doesn't say unless one can tell from the string length of the private key file
[18:54:27] *** Quits: allorder (allorder@user/allorder) (Quit: allorder)
[18:54:32] *** Joins: forgotmynick (uid24625@id-24625.stonehaven.irccloud.com)
[18:55:59] <jelly> deadrom, both files have some structure.  You can use "openssl" or "gnutls-cli" to look at metadata if you can figure out what kind of object is inside
[18:57:07] *** Joins: blaklistd (~blaklistd@user/blaklistd)
[18:57:59] <jelly> so yeah it does say, if you ask nicely, eg. for a SSL private key in pem (base64) format: openssl rsa -in foo.key -noout -text
[18:58:22] <jelly> it doesn't say much if you just stare at it

[19:00:48] <jelly> if it says "Enter pass phrase for foo.key" you can still deduce things from the size, yes

[19:01:34] <deadrom> jelly: the keyfile is RAS and appears to be base64 indeed. The openssl command tells ne quite a few things like modulus, publicExponent, prime1 etc
[19:02:00] *** Joins: nvs (~hibbert@2607:f2c0:93ce:c600:264b:feff:fee1:4af3)
[19:02:20] <jelly> deadrom, so there's no passphrase on it.

[19:04:20] <jelly> deadrom, so there's nothing stopping you from trying to decrypt the other file with it.
[19:04:41] <deadrom> I thought the human redable part of the file would just blabb its secret on base64 -d but that gives me garbles output
[19:05:06] <deadrom> So I can then decipher the dat file with the key?
[19:05:16] <jelly> man rsautl
[19:05:37] <jelly> (assuming you're using openssl tool; dunno what's the gnutls-cli equivalent)
[19:06:39] *** Joins: Brigo (~Brigo@40.181.60.213.dynamic.reverse-mundo-r.com)
[19:08:23] <jelly> the interview question then might be "have you ever heard of asymmetric cryptography and its common formats and tools"
[19:09:20] <jelly> "and if not, can you google well enough to figure out what a file is and how it works"
[19:11:56] <deadrom> Asking Google encryption things gives you boatloads of answers that don't fit your question unless you are sufficiently proficient in the field to know how to chose search words, which in this case obviously means "well, so-so / and hence -> not really".

[23:33:55] <FakuVe> Hi sorry guys , does anyone knows how to filter some lines (exclude them from the output) according to a regexp . Like `journal ctl | grep -v "some pattern" ` alright . but I want the following 4 lines to be excluded as well and seems that `grep -A 4 -v "Some text" ` wont work
[23:37:31] <greycat> seq 1 10 | awk '/2/{x=4} !x{print} x{x--}'

[23:38:38] <Khepra> so greycat. when are you gonna face the balrog and become the whitecat. judging by those arcane sedcantations you dish out so easily, that must've already happened?
[23:38:48] <FakuVe> thanks greycat !
[23:39:29] <greycat> I'm even worse at sed than I am at awk.

[23:41:18] <Khepra> awkful sequantations. 
[23:41:35] <greycat> if this were #bash I would not have used seq
[23:41:56] <greycat> I only used it here because it's simpler than the portable alternative, and I didn't want to have to explain more than one complex piece
