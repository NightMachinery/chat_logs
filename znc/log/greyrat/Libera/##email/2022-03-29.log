[00:19:06] <nedbat> lunaphyte: sorry for the slow replies. I'm used to getting pinged
[00:28:38] <lunaphyte> in short, with just a simple gmail account, there's nothing you can do.  it's just not what it's intended for
[00:28:52] <lunaphyte> to be quite honest, imho, i don't think google should even allow that
[00:31:07] <lunaphyte> both spf and dkim pass, individually, because spf is checked against the envelope sender [which is your gmail address], and because dkim is all "internal" to gmail
[00:32:08] <nedbat> lunaphyte: thanks. When you say, "it's not what it's intended for,"  not what *what* is intended for?
[00:33:17] <lunaphyte> but, none of that matters wrt dmarc, because the From header uses your non gmail address, and thus can never align, with how google is constructing the message
[00:34:27] <lunaphyte> individual gmail accounts are just inherently not "intended" to be used for sending from other addresses
[00:35:27] <lunaphyte> and to be clear, when i say intended, i'm obviously not referring to google's corporate intentions, or potential personal intentions of those who may have a hand in the mechanics of all of this.  i'm referring to the conceptual technical "intentions"
[00:40:16] *** Joins: Hash (~Hash@hey.howstoned.ru)
[00:43:25] <lunaphyte> the non-gmail From header is an interesting dkim nuance though.  have you done a dkim test?
[00:43:32] <lunaphyte> !tell nedbat dkim_check
[00:43:33] <dig-dug> nedbat: I do not know about 'dkim_check', but I do know about these similar topics: 'dkimcheck'
[00:43:38] <lunaphyte> !tell nedbat dkimcheck
[00:43:40] <dig-dug> nedbat: dkimcheck: You can check your spf / dkim / domain-keys settings by sending an email to check-auth@verifier.port25.com. It will auto-respond with some debug information about your settings and spam-score. or you can use this web site: http://www.myiptest.com/staticpages/index.php/DomainKeys-DKIM-SPF-Validator-test
[00:44:04] <lunaphyte> that report would be interesting to see
[00:45:19] <nedbat> lunaphyte: https://gist.github.com/nedbat/e0108c035d623f5ba1874945b67cf47b
[00:46:20] <lunaphyte> so, spf can't pass, but dkim arguably could, i suppose
[00:47:14] <lunaphyte> although that check appears to be referencing your gmail address
[00:47:22] <nedbat> lunaphyte: i guess i'm misunderstanding. that report I just pasted says spf passed.
[00:47:46] <lunaphyte> sorry, yeah
[00:47:56] <lunaphyte> spf in and of itself passes, yes
[00:48:01] <lunaphyte> that's what we covered earlier
[00:48:35] <lunaphyte> dmarc can never be aligned wrt the spf check, even though the spf check itself passes
[00:50:24] <lunaphyte> oh, duh, right
[00:50:40] <lunaphyte> with dkim, the author domain is declared with the d= tag
[00:50:55] <lunaphyte> and google declares that gmail.com is the author domain, so that's the end of that
[00:53:11] <lunaphyte> so since google puts your other email address in the From header, it can never align with spf, because the envelope sender is still gmail.com, and it can never align with dkim because the signing domain is still gmail.com
[00:53:27] <lunaphyte> and since dmarc is about checking the From header, and nothing else, that's the end of it
[00:54:33] <lunaphyte> which is why at this point, google should just stop allowing that, period, imo
[00:56:30] <nedbat> lunaphyte: ok, well at least i've done what I can.
