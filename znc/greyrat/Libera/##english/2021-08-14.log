[00:03:49] <xenial-user10> tinsoldier: Roosevelt Island
[00:03:52] <tinsoldier> Roosevelt Island is a narrow island in New York City's East River, within the borough of Manhattan. It lies between Manhattan Island to its west and the borough of Queens, on Long Island, to its east. Running from the equivalent of East 46th to 85th Streets on Manhattan Island, it is about 2 miles long, with a maximum width of 800 feet, and a total area of 147 acres. Together with Mill...

[00:04:20] <tinsoldier> Rock, Roosevelt Island constitutes Manhattan's Census Tract 238, which has a land area of 0.279 sq mi, and had a population of 11,661 as of the 2010 United States Census. Lying below the Queensboro Bridge, the island cannot be accessed directly from the bridge itself.

[00:05:35] <michigan_> Nice programming!
[00:06:38] <xenial-user10> How you go there?
[00:06:59] <michigan_> My country has also designed a building there: https://www.archdaily.com/867201/cornell-tech-unveils-snohetta-designed-hotel-and-education-center-for-its-roosevelt-island-campus
[00:08:15] <michigan_> Although it's not part of the official stats, maybe because it's a shitty island.
[00:11:11] <bin> Agree or disagree "Don't let's go out tonight" is horrible because you wouldn't contract "let us" to "let's" if you're actually saying it as in "allow us"
[00:11:33] <bin> and technically incorrect because "let us" as in "allow us" doesn't get contracted that way.
[00:11:46] <michigan_> Somehow my country's built a real memorial for my other relative -- one of the faces on Mount Rushmore -- and a real racist. https://snohetta.com/projects/512-the-theodore-roosevelt-presidential-library-competition
[00:12:04] <bin> why do you keep saying "my country"?
[00:12:12] <bin> as if it's some obscure little place nobody has heard of?
[00:12:24] <michigan_> I guess because I'm not American
[00:12:38] <bin> if you're not American then it isn't your country, is it?
[00:12:42] <michigan_> Norway is tiny!
[00:13:00] <bin> OH I thought you were referring to the US as "my country"
[00:13:09] <michigan_> 5 million vs 330 million!
[00:13:13] <bin> but still, just say "Norway" :P
[00:13:21] <michigan_> Oh, no man :)
[00:13:22] <bin> Everyone has heard of Norway
[00:13:36] <michigan_> I didn't know that :)

[00:17:01] <bin> yes definitely
[00:20:41] <TimMc> Hmm. Looking at a map, though, I'm definitely seeing some country names I had forgotten about. Moldova?
[00:21:13] <LjL> i think most europeans couldn't name all of the balkan countries
[00:21:28] <LjL> and many would get estonia, latvia and lithuania wrong in some way
[00:22:31] <TimMc> Oh huh, Swaziland is now Eswatini.

[00:53:10] <StayHungry> bin: not sure what you're asking. but... 'don't let (children) go out tonight' = keep them locked inside,  'let's not go out tonight' = darling, we'd better watch tv
[00:54:59] <bin> no
[00:56:08] <bin> I'm saying that when you're saying "let us do something" i.e. "allow us to do something" you don't contract it to "let's" because it doesn't convey the same meaning
[00:56:51] <TimMc> I don't think it's horrible, but I think your "because" is wrong. :-)
[00:57:11] <TimMc> It's basically the same as "Let's not go out tonight", right?
[00:57:53] <bin> no it's not at all the same
[00:58:12] <TimMc> I don't think it relates to the "allow us" meaning anyhow.
[00:58:19] <bin> your example does not, no.
[00:59:16] <TimMc> And neither does yours, at least the way I understand it.

[01:07:49] <blkshp> Not sure what you're getting at now.
[01:07:55] <bin> yes that's fine, it's "Don't let's" that's the problem

[01:09:28] <TimMc> bin: So you read it as "don't allow us to" rather than "let us not"? If so, why?
[01:09:29] <bin> it was in response to "that that" or "had had" kind of thing
[01:09:34] <blkshp> Oh, gotcha. It's definitely stupid.

[01:14:32] <bin> i was shivering earlier, had to turn my ac up to 20.5

[01:15:18] <bin> see this shows how celsius is silly for these purposes
[01:15:24] <bin> it was at 66 and i turned it up to 69
[01:15:38] <bin> boom, 3 degrees, much more visible difference that reflects the difference in feelings of the temperatures
[01:15:58] <LjL> A/C at 20°C...?
[01:16:12] <LjL> then let's not wonder why the planet is burnng
[01:17:10] <bin> nah if it were burning then I wouldn't be able to cool the house because it wouldn't be able to draw out hot air. 
[01:18:04] <TimMc> It's 30°C here (32°C outdoors I think) and I already lent out our A/C to a friend.
[01:18:15] <bin> Plus a lot of my power comes from wind I think
[01:18:16] <TimMc> but it gets cooler at night and we have fans
[01:18:27] <bin> and nuclear
[01:18:39] <TimMc> I don't think we've ever used A/C below 30.
[01:19:00] <bin> that sounds torturous
[01:19:15] <TimMc> It's uncomfortable, sure.
[01:19:35] <bin> i'm allergic to discomfort
[01:19:55] <LjL> i keep A/C at 27 during the day and 26 at night. i think in countries where A/C is ubiquitous like desert ones, 25°C is standard.
[01:20:46] <TimMc> Now, I do also drink cold water from the fridge, so it's not like we don't use heat pumps for cooling at all...
[01:21:08] <StayHungry> chilly summer evening, +16 C... tomorrow they promise +26, should hire a boat and sail for a while :)
[01:21:12] <LjL> i don't drink cold water, i find it uncomfortable
[01:21:30] <LjL> anyway with 20°C there's usually heating on in my building...
[01:23:43] <StayHungry> LjL: what does you nickname mean?
[01:24:05] <TimMc> In the winter we let it go down to 13°C at night and 18°C during the day.
[01:24:07] <LjL> nothing special
[01:24:32] <bin> well the AC is set at 69 but the ambient temperature in the room I'm in is more like 74 and when it's at 66 the ambient is more like 70
[01:24:49] <LjL> then your A/C thermostat is bad
[01:24:53] <michigan_> LjL: You ever try drinking heavy water? :-)
[01:25:07] <LjL> michigan_, don't think so!
[01:25:09] <blkshp> Please don't drink heavy water.
[01:25:14] <michigan_> Please don't :-)

[01:25:40] <michigan_> They say it's the sequel to water. But trust me it's not!
[01:26:13] <bin> LjL: it's a two story house in a hot climate, it's not going to be a perfect system lol
[01:26:46] <LjL> you can relax
[01:26:48] <LjL> Because it would take a very large amount of heavy water to replace 25% to 50% of a human being's body water (water being in turn 50–75% of body weight[49]) with heavy water, accidental or intentional poisoning with heavy water is unlikely to the point of practical disregard. Poisoning would require that the victim ingest large amounts of heavy water without significant normal water intake for many days to produce any noticeable toxic effects. 
[01:27:38] <michigan_> LjL: I can relax today!
[01:27:50] <LjL> well, you can relax about heavy water
[01:28:00] <LjL> there's always COVID and bin causing climate change
[01:28:02] <michigan_> But not yesterday. But this is about politics.
[01:28:27] <michigan_> Norway owned all of the world's heavy water. Hitler wanted it so bad, but we fought him off. With our tiny ass army. And the Roosevelts.
[01:28:40] <michigan_> Had Hitler gotten it though, he would have made the nuclear bomb, and taken over the world.

[03:21:26] <LjL> H-dropping in English is widely stigmatized, being perceived as a sign of poor or uneducated speech, and discouraged by schoolteachers. John Wells writes that it seems to be "the single most powerful pronunciation shibboleth in England."[10]
[03:22:37] <LjL> "Sandhi phenomena may also indicate a speaker's awareness of the presence of an /h/ – for example, some speakers might say "a edge" (rather than "an edge") for a hedge, and might omit the linking R before an initial vowel resulting from a dropped H." ← this is interesting, French has it formalized in a class of "silent h" words, it does seem to show something akin to a somewhat hidden underlying representation is in our brains

[03:34:14] <LjL> dTal, but you had that word i your underlying representation
[03:34:34] <LjL> that is how that representation differs in a "hidden" way from the linguistic entity that you actually produced
[03:34:54] <dTal> I had it in my head, subjectively as a sound, I just made a transcription error.
[03:35:45] <LjL> anyway, what ksft said. i don't think it happens often (not in european languages anyway), if you have other examples that make it a common phenomenon, i'm all ears! at least the underlying representation of me can be some big ears
[03:35:53] <dTal> It feels like I'm saying the sentence in my head, slowly, and typing to keep up. Sometimes they get a bit out of sync.
[03:36:24] <LjL> i sync so

[03:37:21] * LjL shrugs
[03:38:05] <dTal> I guess maybe it implies something about how language is parsed?
[03:39:39] <LjL> usually you'd say whether "a" or "an" is to be used in front of a given word depends on its initial phoneme. if it's a vowel, then an, if it's a consonant, then a. but in a naive analysis, a form of english that always drops /h/ would not have /h/ as an initial phoneme in /arm/ (meaning "harm", but homonym with "arm" in such a dialect). and yet, it can happen that the speakers of those dialect retain "a" before one, but not before the other, making them homonyms... 
[03:39:39] <LjL> arguably, since presence of an article will disambiguate them.

[03:44:08] <LjL> https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/H_aspir%C3%A9 is the french thing, and "Certains dictionnaires ou ouvrages linguistiques généraux français, dont le Petit Robert3, notent le h aspiré en précédent la lettre d’un signe comme l’astérisque devant la graphie ou à l’aide de l’apostrophe dans la transcription phonétique" is pretty much IPA-for-underlying-representation here, it's not phonetic but it's not even what is traditionally thought of as phonemic, sin
[03:44:08] <LjL> ce it's not representing any actual sound quality of the word - it's indicating how that word influences words around it, in ways that an otherwise identical word might not

[03:45:02] <LjL> darsie, you could argue that yes, although English has a fair bit of tolerance in plural agreement. after all it's not one individual fungus, but also it's being treated as an entity

[03:47:59] <LjL> but i could also counter that the fact this tends to happen more often with words that have irregular plurals because they're from latin or greek suggests that it's not so much a grammatical feature of english at play, as simple lack of knowledge or currency with the standard singular/plural forms
