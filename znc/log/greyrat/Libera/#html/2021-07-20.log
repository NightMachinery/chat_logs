[18:12:52] <innovati> Hi all! Is it expected behaviour that <!-- comments --> within <title> tags are quoted verbatim rather than read as HTML comments?
[18:17:16] <entuland> seems like a spec requirement, innovati
[18:17:58] <innovati> Thanks entuland, I couldn't find it mentioned under the <title> element description, is it mentioned under how comments are processed or somewhere else? It was really surprising for all of us
[18:18:13] <entuland> I found a link but it was for HTML4 something
[18:18:18] <entuland> trying to find it in the living standard
[18:18:22] <innovati> TIL, thanks!
[18:19:03] <stenno> i didn't find it either yet
[18:19:43] <entuland> this is where I found it: https://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/global.html#h-7.4.2
[18:20:05] <entuland> "Titles may contain character entities (for accented characters, special characters, etc.), but may not contain other markup (including comments)"
[18:23:54] <stenno> https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics.html#the-title-element does _not_ mention that
[18:24:45] <stenno> maybe because a text node cannot, by definition, include markup?
[18:24:53] <entuland> it may be inferred by the fact that the content model is text, yes
[18:25:41] <stenno> its a continous text node
[18:25:43] <stenno> yeah
[18:25:47] <entuland> yep

[20:22:40] <entuland> yw
[20:46:03] <stenno> innovati: i strongly recommend reading those specs, imo they are very easy to understand even for laypeople

[22:32:23] <AhmedAmerican> what could that be related to ? https://bpa.st/MD7A this value is generated each time for an XHR request to API within Chinese website. is it possible to decode it ? looks like it's HTML text decoder AFAIK https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TextDecoder
[22:33:13] <stenno> just looks like some encoded cookie thing
[22:33:39] <stenno> ohttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GBK_(character_encoding)
[22:33:42] <stenno> -o
[22:34:05] <AhmedAmerican> possible to decode it ?
[22:34:29] <stenno> no idea
[22:40:50] <stenno> AhmedAmerican: have you tried base64-decoding the bytes and then put them into textdecoder with GBK parameter?
[22:41:20] <AhmedAmerican> stenno: i will give it a try now
[22:41:53] <AhmedAmerican> stenno: but i not seeing base64 here?
[22:43:00] <entuland> doesn't look base64 and TextDecoder() seems to be failing at it as well, but I don't know exactly how to set it up
[22:43:18] <stenno> ok it has dots and underscores
[22:43:24] <stenno> i saw something like that a few days ago..
[22:43:39] <AhmedAmerican> :(
[22:44:16] <stenno> why are you interested in that
[22:44:52] <AhmedAmerican> this value will let me communicate with an API
[22:45:47] <stenno> sounds like a cookie..
[22:46:05] <AhmedAmerican> stenno: if you navigated to that website http://app1.nmpa.gov.cn/data_nmpa/face3/base.jsp?tableId=27&tableName=TABLE27&title=进口医疗器械产品（注册）&bcId=152904442584853439006654836900
[22:46:21] <stenno> i will not navigate to that website
[22:46:22] <AhmedAmerican> and then pressed on next `page`, you will notice an XHR request done to API
[22:46:37] <stenno> this is clearly offtopic in #html too
[22:46:53] <AhmedAmerican> stenno: sorry i weren't aware. but now I'm
[22:48:02] <stenno> looks like wargaming or worse

[23:04:26] <stenno> you do not want to get involved in that kind of stuff lmao
[23:06:02] <entuland> what could possibly go wrong ahaahah
[23:06:15] <stenno> gov.cn is actually what you think it is
[23:06:31] <stenno> so its not wargaming, but worse :)
[23:15:42] <AhmedAmerican> :D
[23:16:20] <stenno> you can get into serious, serious trouble messing with that kind of stuff
[23:16:25] <stenno> and that is the last thing i will say to this
