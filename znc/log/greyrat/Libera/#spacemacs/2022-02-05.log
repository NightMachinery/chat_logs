[03:09:28] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> I assumed you meant Spacemacs changed to emacs state.
[03:09:41] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> So what is the value of `SPC h d v` evil-mode
[03:10:05] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> And what is the value of `M-: evil-state`?
[03:12:10] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> I have implemented continuous scroll in pdf-tools. You can find it here (https://github.com/dalanicolai/pdf-continuous-scroll-mode.el) if you're interested...
[03:14:15] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Of course some pdf-tools features need to get fixed to work with the new scrolling, but it seems to work alright for the most part.

[03:48:40] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> looks great. PR is welcomed.
[04:05:40] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> @dalanicolai you probably can use (feature p 'svg) to check whether Emacs is compiled with it. And then gracefully send a message if it's not. Otherwise load the rest of the functions normally.
