[10:20:34] <microp11_> hi, is it possible to change the value of a variable of a graph using an embedded python block?
[10:24:28] <microp11_> say i have a variable "extra" of type float that is being used by the graph to change alter the frequency of a signal source. this "extra" is zero initially and the frequency of the signal source is "freq+extra"
[10:26:19] <microp11_> however based on decision made inside my embedded python block I would like to set different values to this "extra". is this possible? I just assume it is and i feel i am goin gin circles not being able to figure this out. 
[10:26:31] <microp11_> thank you

[12:42:29] <DerekKozel[m]> microp11_: It is possible, but not a feature that's documented clearly. An option if you're using a recent release is to use the Message to Variable block. Your Embedded Python Block would have an output message port and you'd publish a message with <extra, 100000.0> to the Message to Variable block and it would set the value.

[12:47:50] <DerekKozel[m]> That block also shows how you could set the variable directly if you were writing a complete block (not an Embedded block in GRC).
[12:49:18] <DerekKozel[m]> The block is passed a reference to the flowgraph's set_<variable>() function, then the block's work function (or any function in it) can call the set_<variable>() function to change the value.

[17:59:11] <muaddib[m]> <mbr0wn[m]> "Hey, does anyone have any..." <- I’ve gone down this rabbit hole recently. It appears that the ability to read/parse a vita49 (VRT) file in GNURadio or anything else FOSS for that matter is not existent.
[17:59:12] <muaddib[m]> The ‘vita word’ option’ in the UHD source block was the only thing I could find that had anything to do with it. But I think that’s more for CHDR (modified Vita) than proper vita49? I’d be interested to know what you find.

[18:53:29] <muaddib[m]> I Think a lot of people would certainly be interested in in an open source parsing library for Vita files. If you’re just trying to connect a device that sends a a vita 49 stream AND you’re willing to go through the headache of trying to build Redhawk (Which I spent a good amount of time on recently to no avail) that’s one solution. But that’s only a partial one. 
[18:53:29] <muaddib[m]> Any complete file parser or stream ingest Will have a lot of logic to do as There are a ton of fields that may or may not be populated due to data source configuration. 
[18:55:39] <funkylab[m]> > <@muaddib:gnuradio.org> I’ve gone down this rabbit hole recently. It appears that the ability to read/parse a vita49 (VRT) file in GNURadio or anything else FOSS for that matter is not existent.

[18:55:39] <funkylab[m]> not true, UHD parses the relevant Vita.49.1 subset
[18:55:47] <funkylab[m]> it's the USRP2 transport

[19:48:01] <muaddib[m]> So, If you receive an Ethernet stream from a radio that contains CHDR packets and you use the CHDR dissector in UHD, wouldn’t that contain metadata and also let you extract the IQ data payload portion.

[20:49:22] <jogn_1[m]> such case. 
[20:49:23] <jogn_1[m]> More curious about the ways of limiting the data of interest
[20:50:14] <jogn_1[m]> I don't know if what I said makes sense lol, sorry for being so imprecise
[20:50:35] <patchvonbraun[m]> There's a threshold block
[20:50:42] *** Joins: sn0wflake (~snowflake@k1vzx.com)
[20:50:42] <patchvonbraun[m]> And copy block
[20:50:50] <jogn_1[m]> Ah sweet.
[20:51:13] <patchvonbraun[m]> The problem is that the *general* question "Is this data interesting" is necessarily application-specific
[20:51:13] <BarryDuggan[m]> jogn_1: what version of GR are you using?
[20:51:18] <jogn_1[m]> I was trying to find one, but couldn't but I'll have a look again
[20:51:27] <jogn_1[m]> Thanks
[20:52:03] <jogn_1[m]> BarryDuggan[m]: I was using 3.7 hehe, but I went over to 3.9 now because some OOTs weren't compatiable 
[20:54:06] <jogn_1[m]> patchvonbraun[m]: Yeah you have a good point there
[20:55:07] <patchvonbraun[m]> It would be convenient if the Threshold block had a message output so that it could be plumbed directly into the copy block.    
[20:55:21] <BarryDuggan[m]> GR v3.10 has a https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/Take/Skip_To_PDU which might work for you
[20:55:45] <patchvonbraun[m]> But simple thresholding is only "interesting" in a subset of applications... 
[20:57:59] <jogn_1[m]> patchvonbraun[m]: I don't really have a specific use for now, but it was more like how I can try to perform x, y, and z step by step. Simply experimenting to discover the building blocks. But there are certain things I'd like to try. What I've discovered is that if I try to do anything advanced without first giving it a go, it makes it more difficult.
[20:58:05] <patchvonbraun[m]> There's also:  https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/Power_Squelch
[20:58:49] <jogn_1[m]> patchvonbraun[m]: Could you give me an example of like what?
[20:59:12] <jogn_1[m]> BarryDuggan[m]: I'll look at that. Thanks I thought 3.9 was the latest
[21:00:12] <patchvonbraun[m]> jogn_1: Well, an application might decide that samples are only "interesting" if they contain certain tones, or statistical properties, or....  
[21:00:15] <BarryDuggan[m]> jogn_1: "I thought 3.9 was the latest" - it was until today!
[21:02:21] <jogn_1[m]> patchvonbraun[m]: Yup that's one I thought was interesting since I do have an ML/AI interest. But, I don't really know if that is realistic though. I do have a lot I want to try, but if it is possible I am not really sure since I haven't done anything properly in GNU radio (just small stuff)
[21:03:42] <jogn_1[m]> BarryDuggan[m]: Nice looks like I have to download 3.10 :D Thanks for letting me know. I went from 3.7 to 3.9 and now to 3.10 in a week 🤣
[21:05:16] <patchvonbraun[m]> jogn_1: The field "interesting and useful things one might do at the intersection of radio/radio-signals and computers" is basically effectively infinite in size.  So, there's almost no way that a framework like GNu Radio could EVER have "all the blocks you'll ever need".
[21:06:00] <jogn_1[m]> You have a good point - I don't mind creating OOTs but just wondered if there were :P
[21:06:03] <DerekKozel[m]> That said, there are three sets of blocks for ML/AI :P
[21:06:14] <jogn_1[m]> Why reinvent the wheel when its already been done :P
[21:07:35] <patchvonbraun[m]> Derek Kozel: Well, there you go.  I know essentially nothing about ML/AI.  My son does, but it's not a field I've stepped in.
[21:09:03] <jogn_1[m]> And btw Barry Duggan I enjoyed your GNU conferences. I piled up one page with TODO/goals list I wanted to give a try 
[21:09:23] <jogn_1[m]> I hope there's more conferences coming soon :)

[21:15:54] <jogn_1[m]> that just gave me another idea that I want to try out haha
[21:16:01] <DerekKozel[m]> gr-wavelearner is probably worth seriously looking at, DeepWaveDigital is actively maintaining it.
[21:16:42] <DerekKozel[m]> Another TensorRT which is actually recent is Josh Morman 's gr-trt https://github.com/mormj/gr-trt
[21:16:42] <DerekKozel[m]> GR 3.9
[21:17:43] <DerekKozel[m]> I genuinely don't know how good or bad this is, but I saw this video last month and the code is available.

[21:18:39] <DerekKozel[m]> So, there's stuff around. But gr-wavelearner is the only one likely to have some amount of documentation. It is primarily intended to be used with Deep Wave Digital's ML/AI SDR platform, but I bet it has some reusable ideas at least.
[21:19:49] <jogn_1[m]> Thank you so much!
[21:19:51] <jogn_1[m]> I really appreciate it
[21:20:16] <jogn_1[m]> you just gave me a good idea that I can try out 
[21:21:18] <DerekKozel[m]> Sure thing! The only price is you share your cool stuff with us when you try it out :D
