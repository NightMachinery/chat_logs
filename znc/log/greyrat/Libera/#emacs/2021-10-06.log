[02:18:02] <JibStyle> also, TIL json-parse-string exists, nice!
[02:18:25] <bpalmer> json-parse-string presumably returns a corresponding lisp object for the json you tell it to parse.
[02:18:44] <bpalmer> For example, "hello, world"  is valid JSON; json-parse-string should return a string for it. 
[02:18:52] <mattf> what does TIL mean, i guess you mean "didn't know that existed"
[02:19:07] <bpalmer> TIL about "today I learned"
[02:19:09] <twb> did USA ever have anyone like Clarke & Dawe?
[02:19:10] <JibStyle> yeah
[02:19:11] <mattf> oh i see
[02:19:26] <mattf> bpalmer: how can i determine the type of an object
[02:19:39] <bpalmer> mattf: type-of will work
[02:19:42] <mattf> type-of?
[02:19:45] *** Joins: galex-713 (~quassel@portable.galex-713.eu)
[02:19:46] <mattf> ok it says it is a vector
[02:20:09] <mattf> ok so my question should have been how to get an element at an index of a vector
[02:20:34] <JibStyle> mattf type-of sounds good. FYI, there are also functions for checking specific types, which I think are more common, eg `vectorp'
[02:20:55] <mattf> oh yes i just sometimes have no idea what something is
[02:21:08] <mattf> im testing things on eshell first
[02:21:25] <Catie> for getting an element from a vector, I believe either ELT or AREF will work
[02:21:31] <JibStyle> mattf: try `elt'
[02:21:40] <Catie> AREF being more specialized to arrays, ELT being generic for sequences
[02:22:01] <mattf> oh t hanks
[02:22:03] <mattf> that works
[02:22:05] <bpalmer> Oh, fun, json-parse-string does not correctly handle these cases. (json-parse-string "1") raises an error. 
[02:22:40] <JibStyle> I think "1" is considered a JSON "fragment" which isn't a full object per se
[02:22:46] <bpalmer> what an erroneous function. The grammar is very clear, both in json.org and rfc7159
[02:23:04] <JibStyle> ... may need special handling for json fragments
[02:23:53] <bpalmer> So it's only out of date. rfc4627's grammar is different and limited.
[02:26:38] <bpalmer> 7159 is the current RFC, and json.org is the original description; ecma-404 is consistent with json.org . Yet it contains the hilarious and disproven statement, "Because it is so simple, it is not expected that the JSON grammar will ever change."

[04:55:05] <skangas> But yeah, it's not Emacs
[04:55:22] <grym> i kinda sorta rather often `mpv somefolderowavs`
[04:55:45] <skangas> grym: That fails when you have 1TB of assorted music on your disk
[04:56:07] <skangas> I can't sit in a terminal window looking through all this junk ;)
[04:56:17] <grym> skangas: that's what fzf is for :) 
[04:56:42] <skangas> I don't use it
[04:56:54] <skangas> Oh you just run mpv from emacs+
[04:56:55] <skangas> ?
[04:57:01] <grym> no, in a tmux window 
[04:57:08] <Catie> I had a ridiculous, completely-unorganized music folder that I yoinked directly off of an iPod some years ago, I wound up writing a Common Lisp script to organize it for me
[04:57:10] <grym> usually hidden with guake
[04:57:11] <skangas> Hmm, but then how does fzf help?
[04:57:29] <skangas> tmux is for the cool kids, I use screen ;-(

[04:58:01] <skangas> So then you copy the name into a terminal window?
[04:58:06] <grym> screen's handy for when you want to put a multiplexer in your multiplexer
[04:58:14] <grym> skangas: no... tmux puts it there for me 
[04:58:22] <grym> skangas: derr, fzf puts it there for me 
[04:58:31] <skangas> I literally just have two things open in my screen all the time
[04:59:07] <skangas> Not sure why I would need to switch over to tmux at this point
[04:59:24] <skangas> grym: Inside tmux?  So you run tmux inside Emacs?
[04:59:41] <grym> skangas: no
[04:59:49] <skangas> I'm missing something here
[05:00:00] <grym> it is possible to have a terminal outside of emacs 
[05:00:04] <grym> and i do, and in it runs mpv 
[05:00:10] <grym> streaming or playing local music

[05:04:05] <skangas> You said fzf, didn't you?
[05:04:09] <skangas> Isn't fzf an Emacs package?
[05:04:20] <grym> thre are emacs bindings for it, but no, it's written in shell 
[05:04:28] <skangas> Oh, that's what I'm missing then.
[05:04:40] <skangas> I thought it was an Emacs package only.
[05:04:45] <Catie> Oh shucks, fzf looks super useful

[05:04:53] <grym> fzf is the shiiiiit it's so good

[05:06:38] <Catie> AH okay I get you
[05:06:53] <Catie> What shell do you use, out of curiosity?
[05:07:04] <grym> usually zsh, but bash is fine too 
[05:07:23] <Catie> And you prefer fzf to what comes with zsh?
[05:07:37] <Catie> (i'm also using zsh, so this is a very useful perspective to have)
[05:07:56] <grym> i use both, of course, but fuzzy search is awesome
[05:08:01] <grym> and the UX is nice too 
[05:08:08] <Catie> I'll have to look into it. Thanks for the information!

[06:44:28] <ahungry> of course it'd be faster, you're evaluating less code - in your loop, you'd be executing the let bindings/expansions N more times where N is your loop

[10:51:37] <lazy_eval> these guys are using all the MS stuff allday. word, excel, sharepoint, powerpoint
[10:52:00] <lampilelo> bpalmer: i'm not entirely convinced, iterating over ~110 strings on every message is fast but feels wrong, a dedicated whitelist solution would be better, maybe i just need to do it and upstream
[10:52:07] <lazy_eval> i asked myself if it could be possible to access all these things using only emacs
[10:53:53] <jbe> probably not in any useful capacity
[10:54:03] <lampilelo> lazy_eval: emacs can handle most of that stuff, but read-only
[10:55:17] <lazy_eval> the problem is most of the data/information are in different locations: sharepoint, gitlab, powerpoints, word documents etc..
[10:55:35] <lampilelo> although maybe "most" is a strong word
[10:56:16] <lazy_eval> i would like to access all these data using one interface
[10:57:08] <lazy_eval> i started creating some org files and get data automated using python scripts
[10:59:11] <lampilelo> so what's the limiting factor in your solution?
[10:59:44] <lazy_eval> it is not a technical limitation, more than a user experience limitation

[17:28:46] <ricky88> In "project setup" section:
[17:29:10] <ricky88> n order to generate compile_commands.json for Emacs itself I have found that Bear works fine.
[17:29:12] <ricky88> sudo apt-get install bear
[17:29:14] <ricky88> Setup Emacs sources and dependencies:
[17:29:16] <ricky88> sudo apt-get install -y build-essential git autoconf texinfo libgnutls28-dev libxml2-dev libncurses5-dev libjansson-dev
[17:29:18] <ricky88> git clone git://git.sv.gnu.org/emacs.git
[17:29:20] <ricky88> cd emacs
[17:29:22] <ricky88> ./autogen.sh
[17:29:24] <ricky88> CFLAGS="-ggdb3 -O0" CXXFLAGS="-ggdb3 -O0" LDFLAGS="-ggdb3" ./configure --with-modules --with-json
[17:29:26] <ricky88> bear make -j$(nproc)
[17:30:11] <op2> ricky88: that only if you want to hack on the C part of emacs
[17:30:12] <jeremyc> How do I make my-var to be the result of the contents? i.e. executing concat and my-func?
[17:30:15] <jeremyc> (defun my-func () "Hi")
[17:30:16] <jeremyc> (setq my-var '((:q (concat (my-func) "Bye"))))
[17:31:15] <op2> but the bear part is useful for (every?) C/C++ projects.  Or you can generate a simpler compile_flags.txt and use that.  a compile_commands.json or compile_flags.txt it's all that's required for clangd (don't know about ccls)
[17:32:48] <ricky88> all right, thanks! I'll try that then
[17:33:26] <RunLevelRobot> How can i get the org-journal capture to be full screen? Does anybody know
[17:34:47] <op2> ricky88: the best way depends on the build tool you're using.  For plain makefiles or autotools-based projects you can generate a compile_flags from the Makefile with a rule like `printf "%s\n" ${CFLAGS} > compile_flags.txt` :)

[21:58:18] <andreyorst> akater[m]: thanks for the info!
[22:00:01] <twb> bae: no you don't
[22:00:13] <twb> bae: emacs will run on <1GB RAM
[22:00:18] <parsnip> RunLevelRobot: it's probably your configuration that is causing the problem

[22:01:02] <parsnip> RunLevelRobot: i would suggest learning how to isolate the issue, as at least myself would not be willing to troubleshoot your entire config and org file
[22:01:06] <artefact> i am using emacs/exwm with firefox on a laptop with 1gb of ram. it's admittedly slow but usable
[22:01:07] <twb> https://staticice.com.au/cgi-bin/search.cgi?q=8G%20128G%20laptop
[22:01:23] <bae> But sometimes I have to run something like ProjectLibre or whatever it's called.
[22:02:22] <johnjay> artefact: i tried exwm for 5 minutes but didn't really get the appeal
[22:02:27] <bae> So I should just get another HP Stream?
[22:02:27] <twb> bae: wow that looks awful
[22:02:37] <twb> bae: you can't use MrProject?
[22:02:57] <johnjay> twb: does it really matter if emacs runs in 1,2,4, or 8 GB of ram?
[22:03:02] <johnjay> i mean people have a lot of ram these days
[22:03:10] <bae> It has to be able to edit Microsoft Project files.
[22:03:17] <artefact> johnjay: i just use it as a tiling wm. it lets me use all the familiar emacs keybinds for x window management too
[22:03:18] <twb> johnjay: they said "I need 8G to run emacs"
[22:03:19] *** Parts: bsd4me (~bsduser@user/bsd4me) ()
[22:03:53] <rpav> artefact: you don't actually need emacs to use emacs keybinds to manage windows of course
[22:04:22] <rpav> though if your wm can't support sufficient levels of configuration, definitely best to find one that does
[22:04:33] <bae> I'm using EXWM too.
[22:04:48] <artefact> it's not just about the keybinds. x windows are just emacs windows. you can switch buffers etc seamlessly

[22:05:36] <johnjay> me as well parsnip.
[22:05:36] <parsnip> johnjay: but anyways, probably LSP is one reason people want their emacs device to go brrrrrr
[22:06:04] <johnjay> I was probably thinkin of that old adage, premature optimization is the root of all evil
[22:06:07] <parsnip> but i'm not sure what your question is
[22:06:58] <johnjay> so before putting work into optimizing for size need to establish it affects perf. i guess for emacs you want small startup time, like < 1s.
[22:06:58] <twb> "how many pencils can you stick up your nose"
[22:07:03] <artefact> anyone using auto-compile package? i can't get it to work, my files in ~/.emacs.d/personal are never getting byte-compiled (load or save). here's my init.el https://paste.debian.net/plainh/65a1521d
[22:07:07] <Catie> bae: Did you ever find a way to navigate between windows? I came from i3 (and incorporated its keybindings into my current window manager's configuration), and one of my biggest frustrations was that the only reliable way I found to switch between windows was hitting C-x o over and over
[22:07:09] <bae> The truth is, if I took the time to customize my kernel, and remove some of the ridiculous software I never use, my system would be fine for the next 20 years...or until it breaks.
[22:07:25] <parsnip> johnjay: why are you restarting emacs
[22:07:29] <bae> Catie Yes.
[22:07:33] <artefact> Catie: ace window works well. you can put the indicators on the modeline so it works for x windows too
[22:07:34] <rpav> Catie: you might use windmove directional stuff .. but otoh why bother with exwm for that
[22:07:52] <johnjay> idk. me personally to clear settings to test something, or to clear buffers
[22:07:58] <rpav> i use C-x <direction> to move between emacs windows, and W-<direction> to move between actual windows
[22:08:00] <johnjay> but i imagine most people prefer emacs to start fast
[22:08:01] <artefact> you can also rig something up with windwove or its similarackages
[22:08:06] <Catie> artefact: ace window, I'll look into that. Thank you!
