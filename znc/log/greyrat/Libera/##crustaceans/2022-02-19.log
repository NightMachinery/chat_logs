[07:21:33] <imode> so this was a language I worked on in late 2020, early 2021.
[07:21:56] <imode> the interpreter was written in python just for prototyping.
[07:23:04] <imode> that file reads from the top to the bottom, building up selective definitions to enable certain language features. there are a tiny amount of core primitives, almost akin to lambda calculus.
[07:23:33] <imode> you can see us define booleans (there's a built-in equality operator I used to shortcut that).
[07:23:52] <imode> as well as some boolean ops, all the way up to `if`, and a combinator to make any particular definition/code snippet recursive.
[07:24:12] <imode> we use that recursive modifier to define a while loop.
[07:25:48] <imode> we define new definition syntax, we define block syntax.
[07:26:03] <imode> factorial:bf showcases the culmination of the DSL capabilities by embedding brainfuck into the thing.
[07:32:23] <companion_cube> I'm wondering how interpreters handle blocks ("procedures" in ps?)
[07:32:46] <companion_cube> do they just keep the source code? do they build an array of tokens? use some form of bytecode?
[07:33:20] <imode> all of the above in some cases. internal code representation.
[07:33:41] <imode> a procedure is just a list.
[07:34:03] <imode> an interpreter executes that list by rolling through every element of it and executing it.
[07:34:29] <imode> or you could be like factor and do ahead of time compilation.
[07:34:52] <imode> retro is also another solid project.
[07:41:30] <companion_cube> yeah idk, maybe "compiling" procedures makes sense.
[07:41:39] <companion_cube> anyway, interesting stuff
[07:42:12] <companion_cube> currently, proofs my friends' tools emit can weight megabytes, and they're very verbose. I think more expressive languages can help make them more compact

[08:33:40] <imode> we're considering moving into a house rather than an apartment. it seems tenable, achievable. and yet I'm utterly terrified at the prospect of it.
[08:34:02] <manicennui> https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FL0dmx5VEAEuNjB?format=jpg&name=large
[08:34:57] <imode> not that it isn't a lovely place. it is. it's an absolutely lovely home, nestled in a bunch of NGPA territory, so it can't be developed further.
[08:36:45] <imode> the concept of change terrifies me because it's always some form of anticipatory prediction. you have to think how you'll react to your environment two, three, four months down the road. moving back to our current apartment would not be feasible, so the change is semi-permanent.
[08:37:11] <imode> here we have ducks, geese, and a view of the sunset over the mountains with a short walk. we live above a park and a playground, for better or worse.
[08:38:04] <imode> I don't know anything about the surroundings there, and we don't have the views we do here. my brain goes combinatorial explosion on stuff like this, trying to weigh whether it's worth it to pull the trigger or not.
[08:39:30] <imode> if you asked me to solve a problem in software, sure, no problem. software is malleable, changeable over time, flowing with its requirements. and yet when I look to make some quality of life improvements to where I live, I have a panic attack.
[08:39:40] <imode> "I can't access that thing as easily anymore? The world has ended."
[08:40:30] <imode> change tolerance is a hard mental problem.

[22:37:25] <prussian> Cool I guess.
[22:37:59] <prussian> I guess I need to blog or something. I'm unemployed and unenjoyed right now.
[22:46:30] <gerikson> only blog if you wanna
[22:46:47] <gerikson> tbh I just post monthly photos and book reviews
[22:46:58] <gerikson> I'm a bit more prolific on gemini

[22:58:20] <epilys> client's employee merges a huge PR that doesn't compile and breaks all working tests of existing compiling code because "it was getting too big to review and also it's the end of the week"
[22:58:34] <epilys> last commit message was "brooooken but code looks good" verbatim
[22:58:58] <epilys> client private messages me if I can fix up till monday before their work starts.
[23:00:11] <epilys> I know that's what they pay me for, but I couldn't help it and said "to be a little honest it's kind of a mess, can I rewrite the history?" and I shouldn't have
[23:00:47] <manicennui> They don't have merge checks?
[23:01:00] <riv> that sounds really bad! D:
[23:01:09] <epilys> manicennui, he disabled the broken tests before merging.
[23:01:19] <epilys> from the merge checs.
[23:01:20] <manicennui> And since you mention compiling, I assume this is a compiled language, which is even worse.
[23:01:34] <manicennui> One would think that compiling would be a base requirement.
[23:02:20] <manicennui> I assume you get paid hourly, but I wouldn't do shit over the weekend.
[23:02:47] <epilys> I kind of want to since I don't have anything to do and the extra money would be good
[23:03:07] <manicennui> I suppose it is also good for you if they are bad at what they do.
[23:03:26] <epilys> haha yeah, but I swear my heart rate went up when I saw it
[23:03:46] <manicennui> https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0535/6917/products/consultingdemotivator.jpeg?v=1554328220
[23:04:11] <epilys> Wise.
[23:04:31] <epilys> The fact is they hired this guy because he knew Rust, and I suspect they didn't have a large pool of Rust candidates
[23:04:48] <riv> yikkes
[23:04:58] <epilys> so the employee is the guy who will maintain my work most probably and was hired for this
[23:05:38] <riv> you get paid extra for weekend?
[23:05:43] <epilys> nope, by the hour
[23:06:09] <riv> they need to put some better practices in place
[23:06:32] <epilys> not my place to do anything about it
[23:07:18] <riv> oh yeah not you, but they should
[23:07:20] <riv> for their own skae
[23:07:31] <epilys> speaking of freelancing, how do I put projects/clients in my CV? Can I say client names or should I ask them first?
[23:09:12] <epilys> I don't know the etiquette.
[23:15:47] <manicennui> I would generally not mention their names unless you have permission.
[23:16:01] <manicennui> I'd just have a section that summarizes the type of work you did and maybe industries.
[23:16:17] <prussian> epilys: lmao. Just reset pre commit and put their crap into another branch
[23:16:19] <prussian> Simple
[23:16:22] <prussian> Ok done boss
[23:16:27] <prussian> Fucking christ.
[23:16:41] <epilys> prussian, boss told me not to rewrite main. I asked.
[23:16:51] <prussian> Fuck it, do it anyway
[23:17:00] <epilys> "I'm taking over this operation"
[23:17:32] <manicennui> You don't have to rewrite it to reverse the commits.
[23:17:39] <prussian> I guess you could just revert lmao
[23:18:07] <epilys> I know, it's the perfectionism in me that didn't want to keep them commits
[23:18:15] <prussian> Fuck, I quit over shit like that
[23:18:28] <prussian> Tired of cleaning up someone else's shit
[23:18:31] <epilys> $$$ too good for me to stop working with them
[23:21:51] <prussian> Oh right. Consulting.
[23:22:18] <manicennui> prussian: Yeah, but money.
[23:22:28] <manicennui> I mean, my job is mostly helping other people do their jobs.
[23:22:34] <prussian> Money good
[23:23:00] <prussian> That's story of my life because I was the only person who actually uses linux all day.
[23:23:02] <prussian> Hate it
[23:23:09] <prussian> Hate helping people
[23:25:01] <prussian> DevOopsie
[23:31:23] <manicennui> Fortunately I have a situation right now where I'm paid well for the area, and the job isn't demanding.
[23:31:29] <manicennui> Also helps that everyone is nice.
[23:31:46] <manicennui> Like my manager.

[23:39:39] <gerikson> hey guys did you know that actually ``Monads arise naturally from adjoint functors. Perhaps they are not obvious, but that does not mean that they are artificially complex.''
[23:40:06] <drakonis> moandads
[23:42:00] <riv> ill keep that in mind when i make my next shitty toy web app using haskal
[23:42:39] <imode> category theory is just sparkling graph theory, cmv.
[23:43:26] <drakonis> i still cant believe they made haskell but better, in other languages.

[23:45:13] <riv> for some reason it's bolded and underlined on wikipedia. lol
[23:45:16] <riv> never seen this before
[23:45:47] <drakonis> i hope nix fails, like docker did
[23:45:55] <drakonis> by being defeated by something better
[23:46:05] <riv> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(category_theory)#Algebras_for_a_monad uh this is completely cyclic
[23:46:05] <buttsbot> Monad (category theory) - Wikipedia
[23:46:18] <imode> does nix still require you to extend their configuation syntax/system to support deploying stuff.
[23:46:27] <riv> "every monad comes from an adjunction from this category... this category is defined based on a monad"
[23:46:35] <riv> then WHO was monad??
[23:46:54] <drakonis> imode: yes
[23:47:08] <imode> yeah that's scalable.
[23:47:17] <imode> just extend the build system.
[23:47:22] <imode> for every fucking package.
[23:47:39] <drakonis> there's like 5 different ways to do it
[23:47:48] <imode> does nix at least have terraform-like providers/plugins.
[23:47:56] <imode> that'd make it bearable.
[23:47:58] <drakonis> it does nowadays
[23:48:06] <imode> that's an improvement.

[23:51:29] <drakonis> that too
[23:52:31] <imode> corbin is mildly insufferable.
[23:52:41] <drakonis> mildly?
[23:52:43] <gerikson> lol riv
[23:52:44] <gerikson> nice one
[23:52:45] <drakonis> he's very very insufferable.

[23:52:55] <riv> he used to be way worse
[23:52:55] <drakonis> idris...
[23:52:58] <drakonis> in my lisp???
[23:53:19] <riv> where does the idea of monad actually come from originally?
[23:53:50] <gerikson> ``This endofunctor is quickly seen to be a monad, where the unit map stems from the unit map {\displaystyle \operatorname {id} _{C}\to G\circ F}{\displaystyle \operatorname {id} _{C}\to G\circ F} of the adjunction, and the multiplication map is constructed using the counit map of the adjunction''
[23:53:50] <riv> > The notion of monad was invented by Roger Godement in 1958 under the name "standard construction."
[23:54:22] <gerikson> I love how you can just take a random sentence and it's basically abstract poetry
[23:54:38] <drakonis> from the diseased minds of mathematicians
[23:54:44] <riv> I took a class on the eilenberg moore category at one point, but i literally don't know anything about it
[23:56:07] <kronk> this is why I'm a turing fan.
[23:57:04] <gerikson> statements thought up by the utterly deranged
[23:58:11] <riv> haha
[23:58:53] <drakonis> haskell is a cult
[23:59:34] <kronk> the endocult.
