[01:57:36] <econo> ah ok, it is well regarded then
[02:07:15] <audrey> Philosophy department rankings don´t always correlate well with overall US News & World Report rankings.
[02:07:26] <lalia> Yeah, tho I'll be honest: I only know them for their emeritus staff and Barry Smith, econo. :D
[02:08:14] <lalia> So what audrey is fer sher legit: I'd say the people who rank these things have recently recieved quite a bit of shit for not running reliable programs.
[02:08:30] <lalia> The Gourmet Report chief among them.
[02:08:36] <lalia> Brian Leiter really shit the bed.
[02:09:31] <audrey> My alma mater was ranked by USN&WR somewhere in the high 50s but the philosophy program was an easy top-30. On the flip side, some big names in academia don´t have very impressive philosophy departments.
[02:10:03] <audrey> Of course, that´s ignoring the question of whether school rankings are actually an objective indicator of quality
[02:10:17] <audrey> As my father, a lifelong academic, would have put it, «it´s all a beauty contest in the end»
[02:10:29] <econo> same thing happens for econ. Though when I'm curious about econ rankings I use https://ideas.repec.org/
[02:10:29] <ro-bot-o> [url] Economics and Finance Research | IDEAS/RePEc | ideas.repec.org
[02:10:51] <lalia> Yeah, philosophy programs are odd for me in that they're hot for just long enogh that you really have to be paying attention to department faculty to get a good impression of the state of the work being done.
[02:11:19] <lalia> People who do the ranking only ever arive at these conclusions just in time for the information to be useless, IMO.
[02:11:34] <audrey> The faculty was pretty solid when I was there. Certainly no UC Berkeley or Stanford, but very respectable with a few «big names». I don´t know how it is now.
[02:13:02] <audrey> When you´re in the program, though, you tend not to care about the big names: you just want to get through it.

[02:17:37] <lalia> 'Twas my good fortune to have started my philosophy undergrad in my mid twenties because I took an odd, graduate student style approach to working with my department. Absurdly lucky TBH, I was there as the department went from good to great.
[02:18:13] <lalia> So many talented people there at the same time for almost no reason.
[02:19:26] <audrey> Yeah. I started undergrad at 17 and I definitely did not know how to take full advantage of the resources the university offered.
[02:19:40] <audrey> It was only my junior year before I really started digging into the library stacks.
[02:20:26] <lalia> :3
[02:21:29] <econo> How does graduate philosophy tutelage usually work anyways? It seems like there are less concrete skills that can be taught compared to the sciences. Are profs there mostly to bounce ideas off of and point you at sources?

[02:24:42] <lalia> Well to most people
[02:24:54] <lalia> it seems like philosophy has less structure.
[02:25:11] <lalia> But in fact academic philosophy is quite formalized and highly structured.
[02:26:35] <lalia> Graduate programs normally consist of picking one or more related contemporary issues for one of the traditional subfields (metaphysics, ethics, mind, language, etc.)
[02:27:46] <lalia> and students develop doctoral research on these topics by publishing papers with critiques or contributions.

[13:11:16] <DunceCotus> NewB why not

[13:13:59] <blkshp> What shortcuts?
[13:14:15] <NewB> see how I'm defending you ^
[13:14:23] <blkshp> Not really.
[13:14:30] <blkshp> What shortcuts?
[13:15:12] <NewB> your instead of you're/you are
[13:15:14] <blkshp> "your" is not a short for "you're" it is a different word and makes one look you don't know the difference between the two words.
[13:15:48] <blkshp> "one look like you" See that's be being deficient.
[13:15:55] <NewB> at least it's better than "u r" :P
[13:16:04] <blkshp> Wait... bugger, this is not ##English

[13:16:58] <NewB> why do I always need to google defination of your swear words?
[13:17:10] <NewB> please call me by the swears I know :P
[13:17:23] <blkshp> Which word?
[13:17:36] <NewB> bugger and skulks
[13:17:46] <blkshp> I haven't called you anything (and in BrE we call them "Swear words" and not "swears")
[13:18:35] <NewB> BrE: British English?
[13:18:46] <blkshp> Neither was aimed at you. "Bugger" is just a general sense of dissatisfaction or annoyance, usually at one's self, skulks is what i have just done because i was preaching in the wrong channel (Freenode demise has made me reorganise on screen channels)
[13:18:48] <blkshp> Yes
[13:19:38] <NewB> I'm sorry, I thought they were meant for me
[13:19:57] <blkshp> No, no, no. Dumbass.
[13:20:06] <blkshp> (that one was, but tongue in cheek!)
[13:20:25] <NewB> See how used to I am to you calling me things

[13:21:00] <blkshp> God's*
[13:21:01] * blkshp lols
[13:21:13] <DunceCotus> blkshp that's a belief thing
[13:21:28] <NewB> DunceCotus: I would tell you, but blkshp is opped here, so I can't
[13:21:40] <blkshp> No it's not. It's a name and therefore a proper noun. If you'd said "what in a god's green..." that would be correct.
[13:21:47] <blkshp> Like the Queen.
[13:21:56] <DunceCotus> god is not a name
[13:22:01] <blkshp> Yes it is
[13:22:01] <DunceCotus> its a verb
[13:22:28] <DunceCotus> the Lord or Yahweh is the name
[13:22:34] <NewB> for some people it is a name I guess
[13:22:40] <blkshp> God is a noun.
[13:22:50] <DunceCotus> to me its a verb
[13:22:53] <mwsb> ...
[13:22:54] <blkshp> It's both
[13:22:57] <DunceCotus> in my personal dictionary
[13:23:01] <blkshp> God and god are 2 seperate words.
[13:23:07] <blkshp> God is a god.
[13:23:09] <NewB> how is it a verb?
[13:23:17] <mwsb> To God things
[13:23:22] <mwsb> I will God you, son
[13:23:25] <blkshp> Actually no, how  is it a verbb
[13:23:30] <blkshp> It's a noun and a proper noun
[13:23:38] <blkshp> Few coffee, little brains.
[13:23:38] <NewB> mwsb: what does that mean?
[13:23:43] <mwsb> Yes, DunceCotus is just playing a contrarian.
[13:23:57] <mwsb> NewB: Honestly, I don't know. Tried to put myself in DunceCotus's shoes.

[13:24:20] <mwsb> To be fair, they're pretty comfortable
[13:24:42] <DunceCotus> they're useable.
[13:24:44] <blkshp> Try being a size 14, when you find good shoes, you buy many pairs!
[13:24:51] <NewB> don't wear other people's shoes you may get the athletes foot

[13:25:18] <DunceCotus> NewB become really good at running?
[13:25:33] <NewB> a size 14 is actually a pretty small size
[13:25:42] <blkshp> 49.
[13:25:44] <blkshp> 5
[13:25:45] <DunceCotus> size 14 in what country
[13:25:53] <NewB> oh wait, it isn't
[13:25:59] <DunceCotus> 5 feet sex
[13:26:16] <NewB> why do they count shoes sizes like this in the UK

[13:26:21] <DunceCotus> trichoworning
[13:26:29] <NewB> so do you wear a size 49?
[13:26:33] <blkshp> 19.5
[13:26:35] <blkshp> 49.5
[13:26:37] <NewB> that's indeed big
[13:26:43] <DunceCotus> 49 is just a large number in general
[13:27:05] <NewB> not for everything
[13:27:06] <DunceCotus> (law of large numbers)
[13:27:10] <blkshp> nikes, i get away with a 48.5 sketchers, i sell them to the boat club when im done to go down stream in
[13:27:46] <DunceCotus> you know what they say about large feet
[13:27:52] <DunceCotus> (wide sternum)
[13:28:12] <blkshp> large feet... get away with bald patch.
[13:28:12] <NewB> I once ordered shoes from a UK store and they ended up being several sizes smaller because apparently womens sizes and mens sizes aren't the same
[13:28:20] <blkshp> They'r enot.
[13:28:32] <blkshp> kids also have their own sizes
[13:28:46] <NewB> thanks blkshp, thpugh you should have told me a couple months ago
[13:28:50] <DunceCotus> surely feet are feet
[13:29:00] <blkshp> You didn't ask!
[13:29:00] <NewB> you would have saved me 30 bucks on shipping
[13:29:01] <DunceCotus> one foot fits all... sizes
[13:29:21] <NewB> blkshp: because common sense says they should be the sam e
[13:29:26] <DunceCotus> 30 bucks on shipping? Egregious
[13:29:29] <blkshp> IT would be much simpler if all shoes were the same size and we could take away or add bits to peoples feet to compensate.
[13:29:43] <NewB> same shoe both in the men's and women's section, but in different sizing
[13:30:02] <DunceCotus> blkshp modular bodies
[13:30:06] <blkshp> Men and womens clothing have always had their own sizes
[13:30:11] <NewB> DunceCotus: ship back the wrong size and order the correct one again
[13:30:32] <NewB> blkshp: shoe sizes are different only in the UK though
[13:30:38] <DunceCotus> NewB too much work.. just throw em in the firepit
[13:30:53] <blkshp> I don't bloody know, i wasn't around in1650 when they were invented.
[13:31:18] <NewB> here shoe sizes start from size 1 to 40 for kids and men's usually go from 39 to 50 or something
[13:31:33] <NewB> and women's g up to 40-41 I think
[13:31:41] <blkshp> Well bully for you and your 'metric' bollocks
[13:32:06] <pussipupu> Here shoes aren't available wide enough and my feet hurt a lot
[13:32:13] <pussipupu> Same in the UK to be fair
[13:32:30] * blkshp gives pussipupu a small saw
[13:32:49] <NewB> I don't think there are sizes for width too
[13:33:11] <NewB> but I guess it depends on the style of shoe
[13:34:12] <DunceCotus> you know what they say about wide feet
[13:34:23] <NewB> what do they say?
[13:34:35] <pussipupu> There are different width fittings in the UK scheme at least, but my feet are wider than the widest available fittings
[13:34:37] <DunceCotus> (sizeable cerebral girth)
[13:35:15] <NewB> actually I've heard something else about shoe size relation...
[13:36:27] <pussipupu> Significant correlation with glove size
[13:36:53] <NewB> are there sizes in gloves?
[13:37:01] <DunceCotus> yes, big and small
[13:37:07] <NewB> I never wear gloves

[14:11:50] <NewB> when I was searching how to make it at home that's was the conclusion,  high speed and no plastic

[14:56:08] <T3ddy> You mean like a pour over?
[14:58:14] <lalia> Yeah, that's the idea. The big difference is the size and shape of the filter, but it also produces a coffee with stronger flavor than drip along with the benefit of collecting minimal oils.

[14:58:51] <evolv> so rich
[14:59:04] <evolv> what also helps with coffee, if it hasn't been mentioned, is hard water
[14:59:08] <evolv> brings out the flavors
[15:02:52] <blkshp> and milk
[15:07:57] <T3ddy> evolv: Sometimes I put a small pinch of salt
[15:08:05] <T3ddy> I imagine it has a similar effect
[15:12:12] <evolv> nah, T3ddy
[15:12:20] <evolv> salt reduces bitterness
[15:20:31] <T3ddy> isn't hard water, just water with salts in it?
[15:22:34] <T3ddy> I guess it's water high in minerals, and salt is a mineral
[15:22:39] <T3ddy> so not necessarily salt
[15:27:02] <pussipupu> calcium carbonate mostly
[15:27:04] <evolv> salts aren't just NaCl
[15:27:16] <evolv> yeah, what pussipupu said
[15:27:19] <T3ddy> I know
[15:27:28] <T3ddy> that's why I thought hard water was mostly salts
[15:27:29] <pussipupu> that's the defining solute of hard water, same stuff as limestone
[15:27:35] <T3ddy> not necessarily just nacl
[15:27:51] <T3ddy> is calcium carbonate a salt?

[15:31:03] <badsektor> i like anarcho-capitalism\
[15:31:09] <badsektor> the idea of
[15:31:43] <Beyondo> it's evil.
[15:31:55] <Beyondo> capitalism is bad enough with regulations.
[15:32:04] <badsektor> capitalism is not evil
[15:32:23] <badsektor> but, if you let people on their own, some of them will end up heroin addicts
[15:33:02] <badsektor> so a state that will "take care" of its citizens as if they are stupid children, may be both an insult and a necessity
[15:33:27] <badsektor> but how does one know if that state with all that power to interfere in citizens' lives has the right spirit?
[15:34:33] <badsektor> welfare state is the idea that people are too stupid to save for their retirement or any medical contingencies

[15:37:59] <T3ddy> well, arguably, the older generation has more needs
[15:38:51] <pussipupu> The idea of a welfare state isn't that people are "too stupid" to save, it's that rights which are worth protecting are best served by common action
[15:39:33] <badsektor> people really are too stupid to save
[15:39:50] <T3ddy> how could you call it stupid
[15:39:57] <badsektor> if tyhe state does not force you, it will not occuer to you that one day you will be 70 and homeless
[15:40:00] <T3ddy> how can you for one second posit that postponing enjoyment is the right call?
[15:40:06] <badsektor> exactly
[15:40:06] <pussipupu> People often don't have the opportunity to save
[15:40:07] <T3ddy> we don't know which is right or wrong
[15:40:27] <badsektor> that's the libertarian argument, if one wants to waste their own life, it is their prerogative
[15:40:34] <T3ddy> right
[15:40:35] <badsektor> it is not our business to "help" him
[15:41:05] *** Joins: prahou (~r@freeshell.de)
[15:41:16] <T3ddy> also as pussipupu  said, a good chunk of people don't make enough to save much
[15:41:41] <T3ddy> but maybe they are chosing lifestyles that doesn't leave much leftover
[15:41:44] <badsektor> thats also true
[15:41:54] <badsektor> thats also a good point
[15:42:03] <T3ddy> I think there's a bit of a feedback loop there
[15:42:21] <T3ddy> People who don't have much, just try to enjoy the day to day as much as possible, because it's all they got
[15:42:52] <badsektor> if they knew noone is saving in their places, or forcing them to save by getting a portion from their paycheck before they can even touch it, then perhaps, at least some of them would have to save it on their own
[15:42:57] <T3ddy> So if a good opportunity comes along, they might be stuck in a habbit loop of spending any excess that could be saved for a good tomorrow
[15:43:00] <badsektor> perhaps through an agreement with a bank
[15:43:11] <T3ddy> yeah maybe
[15:43:33] <badsektor> automated, so again they don't get to touch that money, it gets cut from their paycheck automatically, only, this time they can opt out
[15:43:45] <badsektor> and take their chances that they won't live that long to warrant saving
[15:43:47] <pussipupu> "anarcho-capitalism" strikes me as a contradiction, seems it'd just be plutocracy anyway
[15:45:18] <badsektor> now think of mafia and the service of protection they offer for a fee, you can think of the state as a mafia who monopolizes the sector, but why a monopoly? a competition always reduces the prices and increases the quality, to the maximum possible balance
[15:48:06] <evolv> anarchocapitalism is a contradiction

[19:47:28] <ethereal> no but if you had to be asked it means you didn't initally want to volunteer it voltage_

[19:50:57] <DunceCotus> its becoming increasingly clear that 'ancient' greece was not ancient at all

[19:52:27] <lalia> You're making a historiographical claim, DunceCotus. I'm not sure it makes sense either, TBH. What is ancient times for the greeks might be medieval times for the Chinese and both frames of reference would be valid within their own cultural paradigms.
[19:52:28] <voltage_> truthfully

[19:52:46] <voltage_> there isn't an expectation when someone asks you how are you feeling

[19:53:37] <lalia> What history are you refering to, DunceCotus?
[19:53:42] <DunceCotus> the history of this time was borked and fragmented
[19:53:53] <NewB> there's no right answer and in the end of the day if I wanted to share mh thought I would without someone asking
[19:54:02] <DunceCotus> lalia middle ages/ancient greece/ancient rome/ancient egypt

[19:54:13] <DunceCotus> asiatic kingdoms
[19:54:16] <lalia> I'm a legit skeptic. That means I've got zero means of reckoning with what you're going on about, DunceCotus.
[19:54:17] <DunceCotus> middle eastern kingdoms
[19:54:30] <lalia> I'm a trained professional tho, so I can discuss what makes sense from my training.
[19:55:07] <ethereal> a legit skeptic should be skeptical of the books with the facts too
[19:55:14] <DunceCotus> lalia its a bit fringe at this point
[19:55:19] <lalia> There are different contexts from within which it makes sense to think of ancient times as being around the beginning of written history.
[19:55:20] <voltage_> NewB, what if you shared your thoughts and they'd be like "WHO ASKED?"
[19:55:32] <DunceCotus> but like there are strange parallels with the late middle ages and the late greek period
[19:55:40] <DunceCotus> like in technology particularly
[19:55:51] <DunceCotus> and mythology
[19:55:58] <NewB> voltage_: I avoid all these problems by not being in a relationship
[19:56:01] <lalia> ethereal: you're taking the word to be like the dictionary definition of "skeptical" rather than skeptic as a term denoting a traditional perspective.
[19:56:02] <ethereal> lol voltage_, "you did"
[19:56:07] <lalia> So I disagree sincerely.
[19:56:09] <DunceCotus> consider the Antikythera mechanism
[19:56:39] <lalia> You'll want to read some Sextus Empiricus, or at least secondary scholarship by people like Bett or Vogt.
[19:56:44] <ethereal> they're similar
[19:56:57] <lalia> We're not speaking the same language, I'm afraid.
[19:57:00] <DunceCotus> ancient greeks had extremely sophisticated mechanical tech, then all that knowledge was lost apparently for 1500 years until it came around again in middle ages

[19:57:06] <DunceCotus> seems very fishy to me
[19:57:09] <ethereal> dictionary skeptic/sceptic just means one who is skeptical, so 'a person inclined to question to doubt accepted opinions'
[19:57:15] <ethereal> the philosophy definition is 'an ancient or modern philosopher who denies the possibility of knowledge, or even rational belief, in some sphere.'

[20:47:35] <lalia> Had to put my weekly Plato reading group on haitus for a couple months. Kinda sad. In more positive news, they're settling a reading list for the utopia/dystopia reading group as we speak.
[20:47:57] <lalia> And they started a Buddhism reading group a couple weeks ago that's evidently going really well.
[20:48:55] <lalia> Lots of great stuff going on in terms of reading groups. I think our Discord server has like 14 active projects ATM.
[20:49:05] <lalia> Very cool stuff. :)

[21:04:39] <badsektor> imagine him in a living room, existing alone in his own realm since forever, and he has a computer, into which, after an eternity of boredom, he coded a program which simulates a world likes ours, with people inside, acting on their own freewill, and he then chooses this or that individual to send a message to the rest

[23:02:12] <extri> every time someone mentions free will here i find it cringy because people omit what kind of free will. the illusory free will of consciousness, or the being able to make choices based on things that illusory free will manifests in your consciousness

[23:03:22] <Parf> soft-free will is for pansies

[23:03:47] <Parf> the latter of what you've described
[23:04:16] <extri> well that's sarcasm
[23:04:31] <extri> on your part
[23:04:36] <Parf> no, it isn't
[23:05:05] <Parf> it's just me saying that you can't have it both ways with fate
[23:06:08] <extri> once those things that the illusory free will manifests appear in consciousness, you still have to make choices
[23:06:27] <extri> an example would be deciding where to go out for dinner for example
[23:07:26] <Parf> that would still fall under deterministic principles. whether or not the act can be seen as part of an illusory narrative is irrelevant. it's still entirely deterministic in that view, which to me, is a sort of soft philosophical stance
[23:07:28] <extri> i think fate is more circumstances and luck or lack of luck in terms of how things are going for you
[23:08:10] <Panther> If you didn't have something conditioning your choices, what would you be choosing over?
[23:09:43] <extri> and it might be a mostly determinist universe based on an almost infinite amount of prior causes with some randomness, but that's actually not bad at all. sometimes you can flip a coin, etc.

[23:54:44] <lalia> The sort of free will on discussion is normally clear through context, I find. A lot of the time it's the free will of legal culpability rather than free will implying an ability akin to radical cause affecting choice.
[23:55:25] <lalia> I appreciate clarification, but It's not a surprise when people fail to be very clear about it.
[23:57:53] <lalia> Doesn't seem to be a dinstinction people are acustom to accounting for because in the context of ordinary language use the most general meanings of such terms work fine even if they're vague.
