[10:41:08] <Hash> it says ip preferred
[10:41:10] <Hash> why?
[10:41:31] <Hash> That's so confusing. I went through the whole doc and found nothing but this and this is very confusing and I don't undrestand.
[10:41:55] <Hash> right now the user is connected from one vanity vhost
[10:42:10] <Hash> But <*status> This user's default bind host is ::
[10:42:12] <Hash> <*status> This network's default bind host is ::
[10:42:18] <Hash> It does nto show anything. I'm very confrused how this works
[10:43:12] <Hash> Is there anyway to list the number of available vhosts on the system and pick one?
[10:44:52] <Hash> So it is bindhost but language is very confusing.
[10:45:02] <Hash> Don't put the 'ip preferred' in there.
[10:52:39] <Hash> <*status> Cannot connect to IRC (Failed to setup bind host). Retrying...
[10:52:41] <Hash> Hmm.
[11:02:12] <Hash> It is okay now. I understood after some time. Thanks

[20:30:28] <rvalue> I was having Excess flood issue so i found a feature "Flood Protection" and enabled it. Now i am able to use both mobile and desktop irc clients simultaneously without any one of them disconnecting while the other connects to ZNC. But i think i found a small problem. I see there is a huge lag from my message sent from either of the clients, to it finally showing up in the channel. I will comment from Testing12599 on how long it takes for messages to show up

[21:26:17] <psychon> uhm, teach your irc clients not to flood so much?
[21:26:39] <psychon> but I have no clue for the specifics of that plan...
[21:29:04] <knolle> either your flood protection settings are way off or one of your clients is sending way too much stuff

[22:04:04] <Testing12599> psychon: as far as i understand flooding, my clients dont flood atleast to the Libera network themselves.. I dont operate any bots or message so much that my own nick might be flagged as a bot. the only issue i see is both my clients connect to znc and i have a lot of channels open and i was reading something about how many channels it connects at
[22:04:05] <Testing12599> once being related to flooding but i did not understand that, nor did i worry because after all its just connecting to znc, no issues to libera
[22:04:59] <Testing12599> knolle: i would agree on my flood protection settings not being configured properly.. what are some recommended settings?
[22:05:22] <rvalue> rvalue = Testing12599
[22:12:25] <psychon> I don't really know what is going on, but let's do a thought experiment
[22:12:50] <psychon> the limit is 5 commands in 10 seconds; your irc client A sends 3 commands in 10 seconds; irc client B also does that
[22:13:04] <psychon> when both are connected through znc, that combines to 6 commands in 10 seconds
[22:13:10] <psychon> so the problem only appears with znc
[22:13:45] <psychon> and when flood protection throttles things to... I dont know... 4 commands in 10 seconds, then every 10 seconnds 2 commands more than can be sent come in
[22:14:07] <psychon> this builds up a queue of pending commands and this queue gets longer and longer and so ultimately it takes longer and longer for a single command to come through
[22:14:21] <psychon> *however*: it makes no sense to me why your clients would send so much... noise
[22:14:44] <psychon> random debugging idea would be to load something like the [[raw]] module and see what it says your clients are sending
[22:14:44] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/raw
[22:16:35] <Testing12599> sure.. but before i begin to check on that... here are my current settings that, tbh, i dont understand well
[22:17:21] <Testing12599> Flood protection:   Enabled, Flood protection rate:   seconds per line, Flood protection burst:   lines can be sent immediately, Channel join delay:  0 seconds
[22:17:35] <Testing12599> crap
[22:17:59] <Testing12599> Flood protection:   Enabled, Flood protection rate:  2 seconds per line, Flood protection burst:  9 lines can be sent immediately, Channel join delay:  0 seconds
[22:19:37] <Testing12599> and i am barely sending anything from either connected client. but the lag exists
[22:26:55] <Testing12599> ohkay i think i can see whats happening.. there is a lot of /who list command outputs coming in and i dont know why. they are showing up on both my clients
[22:29:12] <Testing12599> omg.. no wonder znc is freaking out. but i dont get why this is happening. what should i look into? i am not executing these /who list commands by myself

[22:41:38] <psychon> well, which irc client are you using?
[22:41:56] <psychon> random guess would be settings like "be able to show user's away status" or "keep channel list up to date" or whatever
[22:42:24] <psychon> another random guess would be: ask in the irc client's channels; they might know better when/why clients send /who commands
[22:42:28] <rvalue> i am using igloo for ios and textual for macOS
[22:42:47] <psychon> AFAIR znc doesn't send them by itself, but it certainly captures their answer when they come across to update some state :-)
[22:46:45] <Testing12599> okay i found it
[22:47:03] <Testing12599> i was in my ios client, something called WHO polling that was turned on
[22:47:17] <Testing12599> it*
[22:49:04] <Testing12599> is this a irc specific term? my only guess is it keeps sending /WHO for all users of any channel i join in
[22:49:36] <Testing12599> that was embarrasing ;( 
[22:50:24] <psychon> I dont think that this should be embarrasing
[22:50:28] <psychon> irc is...weird
[22:51:17] <psychon> I'm not even sure what kind of information this /who provides...
[22:53:33] <Testing12599> i think its normal now
[22:53:42] <Testing12599> thanks for your help
