[04:18:19] <hayley> Indeed it is.

[07:00:09] <hayley> But there is an issue. SBCL has a whole two TLABs for allocation. But MMTk has a lot more than two. There is a comment in src/compiler/generic/objdef.lisp stating that the TLABs are near the start of a thread struct, so that only single-byte displacements are needed to get at those buffers for allocation.
[07:01:26] <hayley> Granted, I have not tested how much larger displacements hurt icache, but the thread structure would be damn huge if I used MMTk's TLAB set as is. Worse, you reserve space for TLABs for all GC plans, even though you only use one GC. So I'd like to just have e.g. the generational-Immix TLABs and be done with it.

[11:07:08] <hayley> That (and something Michael Rosen said) made me think of something though. In English assignments in high school, it seems that you'd get better grades if you used a variety of terms for things, and if you wrote complex sentences.

[11:12:14] <hayley> I think I am not communicating enough context with the MMTk developers, still. I said that it would not be feasible to pick GCs at runtime, because SBCL generates code which assumes a given GC, and this means that allocation code in the dumped image will assume a GC. But apparently it's possible with JikesRVM, and I have no idea how, unless they check which GC they use before allocating, which would be weird.
[11:12:18] <White_Flame> I don't think that really follows

[11:30:35] <gilberth> 800W is not not much, it's less than what a hair dryer uses. A vanilla outlet here is rated 230V/16A which is 3.6kW.
[11:44:44] <hayley> ok, so the answer is that someone got confused. Fine, though it would actually be nice to be able to change GC at runtime, even though we have code compiled with a given GC in mind.
[11:47:44] <hayley> It could be done like invalidating JIT code, but you need to have code for the old GC intact, while you compile for the new GC, so that the compiler can actually allocate in the meanwhile.

[11:55:34] <hayley> When your program is an image, starting the program sort of is "at runtime". And there was a Standard ML system which would change between mark-sweep and copying, depending on which was deemed better for the application.
[11:56:26] <gilberth> Won't you dump an image for a particular application?
[11:58:56] *** Joins: shka (~herr@109.231.3.55)
[11:59:21] <hayley> Sure.
[11:59:44] <hayley> But you still dump an image to bootstrap your Lisp system, and you might want to change GC after that.
[12:00:15] <gilberth> Do I?
[12:00:42] <hayley> If you had more than one, you might.
[12:01:25] <hayley> There's a few in Java because some are for batch programs (e.g. Parallel), some are fully concurrent and optimise for latency at the cost of throughput, due to read barriers (e.g. ZGC), and some in the middle (e.g. G1, CMS).
[12:02:40] <gilberth> Yes, and you know beforehand, if you really need to tune the GC. And what the gain? Is it more than say 10% in performance?
[12:03:57] <hayley> I think between G1 and ZGC is usually claimed around 15%, and 15% between G1 and Parallel.
[12:04:35] <hayley> GC tuning is a thing over there, so I guess it matters.
[12:05:26] <gilberth> What do you loose by not being able to properly inline according to your GC?
[12:05:41] <hayley> Write barriers and allocation gets slower.
[12:06:42] <gilberth> And Jave doesn't dump machine specific code to begin with, does it?
[12:06:48] <hayley> c.f. https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~steveb/pubs/papers/writebarrier-ismm-2002.pdf on the topic of write barriers. I thought there was similar for allocation, but I forgot.

[12:13:35] <hayley> ...or not, there is a old->new filter. /me scratches head
[12:13:58] <hayley> I can teach SBCL to use whatever barrier MMTk wants, but I just don't get why the MMTk barrier is how it is.
[12:18:33] <pl> deferred reference counting widely used? where?
[12:19:33] <pl> usually if you get to deferred refcount, you either can't use a tracing GC due to boundaries you can't trace over, or you quickly decide to go for GC
[12:19:38] <hayley> Exactly. I can't think of any users of it these days.
[12:20:13] <pl> I mean, there's rustaceans, but I don't think they do deferred, they just learnt to spin an extra thread to do the freeing :P
[12:20:35] <hayley> Trial deletion exists for RC these days, or you use a tracing GC as backup. I also have some hopes for ulterior RC or similar, which uses a tracing nursery, but deferred-RCs old objects.

[14:17:28] <hayley> There also was an instance when someone hijacked receipt machines to print anti-work material (though, knowing my luck, it was shit).
[14:18:00] <hayley> Now I wonder if making a PS file which produces infinite pages will convince a printer to print that many pages.
[14:18:30] <pjb> Yes, postscript files are just programs.
[14:18:57] <selwyn> did they actually try to flood printers in the end?
[14:19:05] <hayley> I am aware, but it is an implementation issue if the printer decides to buffer up pages, for some reason.
[14:19:08] <hayley> I believe they did.

[14:38:45] <gilberth> How many printers do actually accept PS?
[14:40:53] <hayley> Mine does. So did the one at high school.
[14:41:19] <hayley> But, again, you can cheat and port scan for port 9100 to find some that likely do accept PS.
[14:41:38] <gilberth> Mine does too, it even offers a PS REPL.
[14:44:55] <hayley> Mine does not offer a REPL.
[14:47:08] <gilberth> You need to say "interactive" or something. There is some standard operator to give you a REPL.
[14:48:11] <hayley> I recall. But it didn't work.
[14:48:31] <hayley> Instead, it would rudely echo lines back.

[14:59:38] <gilberth> The only thing that Germans could be concerned about is the natural gas price and whether we would have enough to heat our homes.
[15:01:47] <gilberth> As always the US is the winner and has what they always wanted: Us not buying Russian gas though the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Germany happily folded. Great move. /me shrugs.
[15:04:09] <hayley> "Isn't it funny that the Australian government defunded security researchers, and now they are complaining Russia is performing cyber attacks?" "Erm, that's not true." "Fine, I missed a 'going to' before 'performing'. Still stupidly funny."

[15:07:22] <selwyn> gilberth: i think germany will quietly walk it back
[15:07:41] <selwyn> there's only so long you can keep a fully functioning gas pipeline closed
[15:08:34] <gilberth> selwyn: I don't believe so. There is too much ideology involved.
[15:08:54] <selwyn> well, you would know better than me
[15:09:16] <kakuhen> so i recall earlier wondering how to draw pixels directly on a screen, and i learned recently that is a bad idea
[15:10:06] <kakuhen> it looks like what i want to do, assuming i want cross-platform way to render images, is to allocate a bunch of tiny rectangles with opengl, then one texture, and progressively copy arrays of pixels to it, or something like that
[15:10:28] <kakuhen> and apparently this is somehow faster than drawing images pixel-per-pixel
[15:10:29] <selwyn> why is it a bad idea
[15:10:47] <kakuhen> performance & doing so defeats the purpose of most graphics libraries
[15:11:06] <kakuhen> or at least everyone i see online says i should be using textures and mapping them to framebuffers or other stuff
[15:11:17] <selwyn> perhaps i am missing something, but i would just put the pixels into a texture and render that
[15:11:27] <kakuhen> yeah my original idea was to ignore the texture
[15:11:31] <gilberth> It's not like the majority was pro-pipeline even before the current crisis. The Green party is particular funny, being anti-nuclear and thus pro-we-burn-natural-gas-for-electricity but at the same time always has been anti-pipeline. However if gas and electricity prices which doubled already would double again, the public might reconsider. And there could be protests.
[15:11:32] <kakuhen> manipulate each pixel of a window directly
[15:12:01] <selwyn> kakuhen: textures are there to make your life easier
[15:14:18] <kakuhen> yaeh and now i am trying to find a common lisp library that makes my life easier for this goal
[15:14:19] <gilberth> kakuhen: Is there anything stopping you from using glDrawPixels?
[15:14:23] <kakuhen> it seems that in the past people were fine with cl-opengl
[15:14:36] <kakuhen> gilberth: people who seem to know a lot more than me telling me it's a bad idea
[15:14:46] <selwyn> cl-opengl is still fine
[15:15:06] <kakuhen> I saw also recommendations for something called a "pixel buffer object," but to be honest, I understand nothing about graphics
[15:15:44] <kakuhen> and the craziest thing I saw was some dude saying you can make your life easier by texturing a 3d object with an image and then using an orthographic projection to fill a 2d window with it
[15:16:09] <gilberth> Well, glDrawPixels is not fast. You would need to do that to a texture. Once it's in the texture, you're set. Or does your image change often?
[15:16:09] <selwyn> that sounds like showing off
[15:16:47] <kakuhen> yeah it seemed overkill for my problem
[15:16:47] <kakuhen> i say this while suffering in a differential geometry class right now and often overkilling problems
[15:17:02] <kakuhen> gilberth: my interest for now is to render a still image
[15:17:13] <kakuhen> i want to eventually make a jpeg decoder entirely in common lisp
[15:17:33] <kakuhen> but before i seriously work on it, i first want to make sure i can display an array of pixels on a screen
[15:18:19] <gilberth> Yes, then just use glDrawPixels for transfer to a texture and be set. It nicely does the conversion from what ever format you specify.
[15:18:19] <kakuhen> because, quite frankly, that seems a lot more harder than trying to dequantize & apply inverse DCTs to recover whatever was compressed
[15:18:39] <selwyn> i would use sdl2 or something
[15:19:01] * gilberth doesn't like SDL at all.
[15:19:18] <kakuhen> yeah, if cl-opengl is still maintained i think i'm gonna go with that, maybe
[15:19:31] <kakuhen> i just want to make a really stupid image viewer that will host a window and let me view what i tried decoding
[15:19:50] <kakuhen> and depending on my dunning-kruger level by then, maybe i will even try to do something insane like mpeg-1 decoding
[15:20:02] <gilberth> kakuhen: Aren't you a CCL user?
[15:20:26] <kakuhen> yes i am, despite seeing how awfully slow CCL is compared to SBCL when I run millions of iterations of a DCT
[15:20:33] <kakuhen> granted I didn't use the so-called "discretized" version of it
[15:20:43] <selwyn> cl-opengl is used all the time its fine
[15:20:43] <kakuhen> i just took the usual definition from math books and let it figure out how to deal with dividing floats over and over again
[15:21:33] <selwyn> you would need something to do the windowing and get the gl context, like glfw3 https://github.com/AlexCharlton/cl-glfw3
[15:21:34] -ixelp- GitHub - AlexCharlton/cl-glfw3: Common Lisp bindings to GLFW version 3.x
[15:22:29] <kakuhen> oo this seems very usefu, i wish i saw that library earlier
[15:22:58] <selwyn> i would try to use some kind of graphics library tbh
[15:23:31] <gilberth> I was just asking because with CCL you could say (use-interface-dir :gl) for OpenGL. And must it be OpenGL?
[15:24:18] <kakuhen> well, it returns an object, but I'm not familiar with this part of CCL
[15:24:20] <selwyn> sth like this https://github.com/vydd/sketch

[15:28:41] <hayley> This is the most obscure recovery I've ever read and I love it
[15:29:28] <kakuhen> hmm that's funny, unlike the SDL bindings, this does not make ccl hang on a syscall
[15:29:38] <kakuhen> im looking at the cl-glfw3 examples right now
[15:31:09] <kakuhen> ah, it's returning a CALL-TASK object, which may be different a thread? not sure. in any case, i can actually see its status change from RUNNING to COMPLETED when i close the window and refresh the SLY inspector
[15:31:10] <kakuhen> this is neat
