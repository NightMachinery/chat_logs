[01:06:16] <loopspace> What's the category theory topic?
[01:06:34] <riv> I was a little confused about comma categories
[01:06:51] <riv> the general definition F,G given two functors makes sense
[01:07:03] <riv> and that you sometimes use an object instead of a functor
[01:08:05] <riv> but then they give this example: let K be a comm. ring, show K,CRing is the category of small commutative K algebras
[01:08:15] <riv> why is it a category (CRing) there
[01:08:28] <riv> are we considering that as an object from Cat?
[01:14:10] <riv> kinda skipping that exercise because of unfamiliarity
[01:14:43] <loopspace> b \downarrow C has objects: arrows in C from b.

[03:55:55] <Cale> tusko: In the homework for the Calc 1 course I had in university, we did just 8 symbolic integrals (not counting easily evaluated things), but they were all carefully designed to make us hate symbolic integration. One of them was the integral of (sec(x))^5

[06:35:49] <somiaj> maybe, but may do math for the theory, not with any application in mind either now or in the future. If someone happens to be able to apply it in the future, that is fine, but that isn't a goal.
[06:36:10] <somiaj> and I think you have a very strict definition of what is considered junk
[06:38:49] <Fangs> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/RPYEi3HY/derivative.jpg
[06:39:04] <Fangs> where do they get the stuff with eta?
[06:40:17] <Fangs> for context on notation: if f is a complex function then they might write f(z) as f(a,b) where z = a +ib interchangably
[06:40:52] <somiaj> what stuff with eta are you confused about, just looks like the derivative definition?
[06:41:04] <Fangs> so there's a horrible abuse of notation there, but I don't quite get why they are dividing by i I supposed
[06:41:14] <Fangs> maybe they do that to make it entirely real?
[06:42:10] <somiaj> the derivative definition requires the limit as w->0 where w is a complex number.
[06:42:13] <Fangs> ok somiaj so the first expression and second expressions are partial derivatives of f wrt to x and y respectively that's fine. but why would they have to equal each other
[06:43:32] <somiaj> If this limit exists, that means it exists for any path to zero, so you can either go to zero along the real axis, as xi->0 for xi real, or you can go to zero along the imaginary axis as eta i -> 0 where eta is real.
[06:43:41] <somiaj> so they are just approaching zero along the imaginary axis
[06:43:57] <somiaj> they equal each other because they both equal f'(a) and equality is transitive
[06:44:32] <Fangs> I don't remember the definition of complex differentiability
[06:45:36] <Fangs> fix z, f(z+e) = f(z) + zM(e) + o(z^2) iirc
[06:45:53] <somiaj> it is the same as real differentialtion, except as h->0 (or x1 -> a), you do these limits in the complex plane using complex numbers
[06:46:30] <somiaj> so lim w->0  (f(z+w) - f(z))/w, or lim w->a (f(w) - f(a))/(w-a)
[06:47:00] <Fangs> I swear I thought you needed an absolute value somewhere
[06:47:36] <somiaj> sure you can write it in terms of its taylor series approximation, but you have to be careful there, you really need to ensure that that limit exists (which is really strong, because if the limit exists in the complex numbers, then having the first derivative exist is equivlant to be analytic (all derivatives exist and the taylor series converges in some open neighborhood)

[07:16:05] <Z-module> yeah, for example f(z) = Re(z)  is real-differentiable on all of C, but complex-differentiable nowhere
[07:23:26] <Fangs> R^2 differentiable -> C-differentiable is only true if it satisfies the cauchy-riemman equations I think somiaj
[07:23:35] <Fangs> but I never understood what that meant
[07:23:45] <Cale> normerns: I don't know why that would matter.

[07:32:46] <Cale> johndoe_: I don't really get what you're talking about, people publish conditional results all the time, especially if the thing they're conditional on is a well-known open problem, it provides useful context. There's tons of stuff that's implied by RH, for instance. Also, while pure mathematics might not care very much about immediate applications, people don't tend to spend a whole lot of time and effort working on
[07:32:46] <Cale> things they're not interested in. There's usually some motivation behind anything that someone's spent a bunch of effort on, often problems which we didn't previously know how to solve.

[07:40:30] <Cale> The word "theory" is used in both a formal sense in mathematical logic (a collection of sentences in a formal language), as well as in an informal sense to refer to broad areas of mathematics. People don't "have theories" to themselves, at least not most people without Fields medals. You might mean the word in some other sense though.

[09:11:58] <DarkDaemon> hi
[09:12:37] <DarkDaemon> i'm trying to understand sine waves but really struggling. I want to output a middle C sound and make the wave using a sine wave. i understand it should be ~262Hz so I made a wave using this formula: y= 3000 * sin(262 * x) . 3000 being my amplitude (or volume in this case) and 262 being my frequency. when I use this formula to calculate the sample
[09:12:37] <DarkDaemon> values, the sound comes out horrid
[09:12:43] <DarkDaemon> int16_t SampleValue = ToneVolume * sinf(ToneHz * RunningSampleIndex);
[09:12:43] <DarkDaemon> i'm sure i'm doing something wrong related to pi but i'm really winging it right now and not sure what to google to find this missing piece of the puzzle
[09:13:03] <DarkDaemon> any help would be appreciated
[09:14:05] *** Quits: ElectronApps (~ElectronA@user/electronapps) (Remote host closed the connection)
[09:14:46] <moon-child> DarkDaemon: you need to scale according to the period of sin (2pi) and your samplerate (likely 48khz)

[09:15:34] <DarkDaemon> moon-child yes my sample rate is 48khz but i'm sorry i don't understand what you mean by scale
[09:19:43] *** Joins: MarkT- (~markt@S0106244bfe907043.vs.shawcable.net)
[09:20:22] <moon-child> you want to produce a signal which has 262 peaks for every 48000 samples; or, which has one peak every ~183 samples.  If you say:  value = sin(sample_index),  you will get a peak every ~6.28 samples
[09:21:36] *** Joins: sebastianos (~sebastian@user/sebastianos)
[09:22:30] <moon-child> (where 183 ~ 48000/262)
[09:22:56] <moon-child> you want to reduce the rate of the function; multiply the sample rate by the ratio of 6.28 to 183
[09:25:50] <MarkT-> I am trying to determine some function f(x) whose first derivative is always positive, where f(0)=0 and f(1)=1, such that the weighted average height of f(x) = k across x=0..1, where the weighting is such that x is more likely to be closer to k than further from it, similar to a normal distribution (although not symmetic, since k is not necessarily exactly 1/2).
[09:26:12] <moon-child> err, sorry, multiply the sample _index_ by the ratio...
[09:26:47] <MarkT-> I had originally tried x^(-ln(k)/ln(2)) because that has an average height of k, but when x is more likely to be closer to k than further from it, the results are skewed.
[09:27:27] <DarkDaemon> moon-child how did you get the ~6.28?
[09:27:38] <DarkDaemon> is that just sin(x)?
[09:27:44] <moon-child> 6.28 is 2pi
[09:28:16] <DarkDaemon> ah okay
[09:28:30] <DarkDaemon> i think i get what you mean, let me try implementing it and will let you know :)
[09:28:32] <DarkDaemon> thank you!

[14:35:29] <joel135> I suppose H is a subgroup of G, and N is a normal subgroup of G. The subset HN of G is acted on by N on the right, and then HN/N denotes the 'connected components' of HN by this action.

[16:45:57] <Z-module> and G/H is then not merely a set of cosets, but in fact  a group
[16:46:13] <cadmio> G/N is a group
[16:46:28] <Z-module> yes if N is normal
[16:46:41] <Z-module> not just any old group, but a homomorphic image of G
[16:46:42] <cadmio> G/H with H not normal is just a quotient set
[16:46:53] <Z-module> well, try not to write that for that
[16:47:01] <Z-module> people do sometimes, but it's confusing
[16:47:23] <Z-module> not to mention ambiguous
[16:47:31] <Z-module> (since you have to specify left cosets or right cosets)

[17:17:45] *** Joins: koolazer (~koo@user/koolazer)
[17:20:09] <Z-module> oh, Fangs, you said earlier you didn't understand "what they mean" about an R^2-differentiable function needing to satisfy Cauchy-Riemann in order to be complex-differentiable. You mean the statement of what that says, or why it's needed?
[17:23:09] <Fangs> Z-module: I just dont remember why you can define complex differentiability as the 'usual' limit as if it were a function from R to R
[17:23:21] <Fangs> for R^n to R, you'd need a norm somewhere
[17:23:25] <Z-module> The statement is easy: Say U is a plane-open set and  f: U -> R^2  where f(x,y) = (u(x,y), v(x,y))  and the component functions u, v both have continuous first-partials u_x, u_y, v_x, v_y.  This much is f being R^2-differentiable throughout U.  If you interpret pairs (x,y) as complex  numbers x + iy now, it's only complex-differentiable (= holomorphic, = analytic) on U if also  u_x = v_y  and  u_y = -v_x  throughout U.
[17:24:15] <Z-module> f'(z) is the limit  (f(z + h) - f(z))/h  as *complex* h -> 0, and that "/h" there is complex division.
[17:24:32] <Z-module> and this has to exist and be the same for all possible ways of h -> 0 in the plane
[17:25:15] *** Joins: oxum (~oxum@136.185.133.224)
[17:25:22] <Z-module> simply letting h -> 0 through positive real values first, then again going through values ri  with r positive real (r -> 0), is what immediately yields u_x = v_y,  u_y = -v_x

[17:26:26] <Fangs> none of this is intuitive
[17:26:56] <Fangs> Z-module: back in the old days, my prefered intepretation of cauchy riemman is simply that the total derivative of f "looks like a complex number"
[17:27:13] <Z-module> that works out as well
[17:27:41] <Fangs> I don't remember how to intepret limits, again. I remember there being an absolute value somewhere in the differentiability definition
[17:28:20] <Fangs> I think if f: R^n -> R, then you'd have defined the partials as lim f(x+h) - f(x)/||h||
[17:28:42] <Fangs> or at least the directional derivative in the direction of h

[17:28:51] <Z-module> because the Jacobian  [u_x, u_y; v_x, v_y] = [u_x, u_y; -u_y, u_x]  and this R-linear map on R^2 is nothing but complex multiplication by  u_x + i u_y
[17:30:12] <Fangs> do you remember when you and MiseryMyra had to lecture me all day about complex analysis?
[17:31:16] <Z-module> well, OK, saying (in the plane sense)   w = lim_{h -> 0} (f(z + h) - f(z))/h   where w, z, h are complex   is exactly:  forall real eps > 0  exists real delta > 0 :  0 < |h - 0| < delta  ==>   |(f(z + h) - f(z))/h - w| < eps.

[17:34:08] <Z-module> so this complex number w, thought of as a linear map L: R^2 -> R^2  (complex multiplication by w)   is exactly the linear L satisfying  lim_{h -> 0} |f(z + h) - f(z) - Lh| / |h| = 0,  which is the standard R^2-differentiability of f at z.
[17:35:07] <Z-module> If g is a complex function in the plane,  g -> 0  (as a plane limit)  iff  |g| -> 0  as a real-valued function.

[19:36:52] <Franciman> so P^1(C) has two complex planes intersecting?
[19:37:00] <rubiksdream> johnkeats7 the version I know uses bezouts theorem and the riemann-hurwitz formula
[19:37:01] <johnkeats7> was it the riemann hurwitz thing
[19:37:03] <rubiksdream> yeah
[19:37:48] <rubiksdream> Franciman really U_0 and U_1 are the sphere minus the north/south pole (resp.)
[19:38:14] <rubiksdream> thats how I would visualize it

[19:43:49] <Franciman> visualize
[19:43:51] <Franciman> :D
[19:44:03] <rubiksdream> you are gluing together n copies of C^n to form P^n(C)
[19:44:12] <rubiksdream> those copies are the U_i
[19:44:31] <Franciman> ok
[19:44:31] <rubiksdream> you can literally see how you are gluing them together in the case of P^1(C)
[19:44:35] <Franciman> now can I ask you one more thing?
[19:44:46] <rubiksdream> sure
[19:45:00] <rubiksdream> (n+1)-copies *
[19:45:05] <Franciman> when I do the blowup of a the complex space C^2 in 0
[19:45:35] <rubiksdream> i haven't learnt about blowups yet :/ sorry
[19:45:39] <rubiksdream> or desingularization
[19:45:41] <Franciman> I obtain this space B = { ((z, w); [a, b]) \in C^2 \times P^1(C) : aw + bz = 0 }
[19:45:42] <Franciman> oh ok
[19:45:46] <Franciman> nvm ;)
[19:45:48] <Franciman> thanks a lot
[19:45:52] <rubiksdream> np
[19:46:06] <Franciman> basically those [a,b] are the tangent lines in 0
[19:46:10] <Franciman> so they are all the possible directions
[19:46:32] <rubiksdream> right, that makes sense
[19:46:38] <Franciman> now I am a bit unsure about
[19:46:40] <Franciman> what I get
[19:46:48] <Franciman> when I read things in these two charts
[19:47:11] <Franciman> B_0 = { ((z, w); [1, b]) \in C^2 \times U_0 : aw + bz = 0 }
[19:47:25] <Franciman> so I again watch the projective complex line in the two charts
[19:47:38] <Franciman> it is as if I split the possible tangent lines
[19:47:40] <Franciman> in two spaces
[19:48:19] <Franciman> so I think it is like, in B_0 you take all tangents except the one with coordinate x = 0
[19:48:26] <Franciman> so the x axis
[19:48:35] <Franciman> and in B_1 you take all tangets except the one with coordinate y = 0
[19:50:10] <rubiksdream> okay, so in B_0 you take all the tangents except {y=0} and in B_1 you take all the tangents except {x=0}, so in other words (using dual P^1(C) to parameterize tangents), you are really looking at U_0 and U_1

[19:52:05] <Franciman> something like this, yep
[19:52:09] <Franciman> you do this, because
[19:52:21] <Franciman> if you are given a singular surface S
[19:52:28] <Franciman> and it is singular in (0, 0)
[19:52:31] <Franciman> you say, ok
[19:52:37] <Franciman> there must be some tangent missing
[19:52:54] <Franciman> or there are too many tangents
[19:53:05] <rubiksdream> well there would be several higher tangents
[19:53:09] <rubiksdream> at a singular point
[19:53:18] <Franciman> yup
[19:53:20] <Franciman> so you do
[19:53:25] <Franciman> well first you define
[19:53:41] <Franciman> pi : B -> C^2 , as pi((z, w); [a, b])) = (z, w)
[19:53:45] <Franciman> and then you do
[19:54:06] <Franciman> S' = topological closure of pi^{-1}(S - {0})
[19:54:21] <Franciman> so what you do is like, get all the S, except for 0
[19:54:34] <Franciman> but now, 0 is replaced by many copies of 0
[19:54:40] <Franciman> one for each direction of the tangents
[19:54:44] <Franciman> in case of a node
[19:54:46] <Franciman> you would get
[19:55:03] <Franciman> ((0, 0); [1, 0]) and ((0, 0); [0, 1])
[19:55:13] <Franciman> (after a bit of affine transformations)
[19:55:21] <rubiksdream> so one for each tangent?
[19:55:24] <Franciman> exactly!
[19:55:30] <Franciman> if you squint enough
[19:55:41] <Franciman> what you do when you do the topological closure of pi^{-1}(S - {0})
[19:55:45] <Franciman> is get the secant
[19:55:51] <Franciman> from 0 to a point (z, w)
[19:55:57] <Franciman> and make (z,w) converge to 0
[19:56:00] <Franciman> so you get the tangent
[19:56:29] <Franciman> so you get the different tangents at 0

[21:44:46] <qergle> ok, i am not sure what level of rigor you're being taught, but an RV is a function, typically taken to be real-valued, i.e. X:Î© â â

[21:45:38] <qergle> which then prompts the question what is meant by "X=X"
[21:46:27] <CuriousErnestBro> qergle I've learned that at one point I think, we did gloss over the sigma algebra stuff though. Isn't X from the set of events. to R as opposed to the sigma algebra set?
[21:47:26] <CuriousErnestBro> qergle the only answer I can give you there is if you have E[X|X=x] where X takes on a "realized" value x, then X=X means that X takes on its own value, so it's the same as E[X|X]
[21:48:55] <qergle> an RV is a function from the sample space (often denoted Î©) to â (real numbers)
[21:49:27] <qergle> let's forget about X. call it f(x) instead.
