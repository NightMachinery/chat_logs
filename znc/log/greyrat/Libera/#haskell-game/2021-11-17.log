[07:24:40] <sm> f-a: cave 1 370 and 450 are the points that wreck me
[07:28:45] <sm> lol it's an exercise is remaining calm when you see that fricking twisty bit zooming up the screen
[07:29:57] <f-a> I have a ‘4’ there
[07:32:06] <sm> I should put a skull when it goes above 9..
[07:33:25] <f-a> hehe
[07:33:41] <sm> aieee.. so tense

[14:46:27] <alexfmpe[m]> so I'm trying to experiment with GPipes but keep getting this weird error straight away on window creation
[14:46:33] <alexfmpe[m]> CreateSharedWindowException "WindowConfig {configWidth = 640, configHeight = 480, configTitle = \"\", configMonitor = Nothing, configHints = [WindowHint'Visible False,WindowHint'ContextVersionMajor 3,WindowHint'ContextVersionMinor 3,WindowHint'OpenGLForwardCompat True,WindowHint'OpenGLProfile OpenGLProfile'Core], configSwapInterval = Nothing}"
[14:46:44] <alexfmpe[m]> both ghc and ghci 
[14:46:50] <alexfmpe[m]> what's odd is that I get this exact error even if I provide a different configWidth/configHeight
[14:47:25] <alexfmpe[m]> I'm using the runContext/newWindow example from the tutorial http://tobbebex.blogspot.com/2015/09/gpu-programming-in-haskell-using-gpipe.html
[15:00:38] <alexfmpe[m]> `:set -fno-ghci-sandbox` also has no effect

[21:09:06] <EvanR> tried to install ubuntu in a 10G virtual box... failed xD
[21:10:16] <sm> EvanR, don't know if it helps but I have found multipass makes setting up a virtual ubuntu very easy
[21:11:18] <EvanR> multipass?
[21:11:28] <EvanR> like 5th element?
[21:11:33] <sm> yup!
[21:15:01] <sm> convincing your platform it should run your thing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JljZbjpvjmE
[21:19:02] <ManofLetters[m]> alexfmpe[m]: ic.rbow or somebody else over at Haskell Gamedev discord may now more about GPipe
[21:20:08] <alexfmpe[m]> ah thanks
[21:20:08] <alexfmpe[m]> though I very much suspect this is actually a drivers issue as I ran into the same thing with glut and glfw
[21:20:23] <alexfmpe[m]> https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/47415 more specifically
[21:24:44] <alexfmpe[m]> s/same thing/different error but probably root cause
[21:41:40] <icrbow[m]> 0 days since last NixOS issue
