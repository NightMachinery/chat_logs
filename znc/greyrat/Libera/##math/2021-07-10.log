[01:25:04] <dextaa> oh right that's https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monadic_predicate_calculus
[01:25:46] <rubiksdream> i think the proof is simple if you reduce it to the halting problkem
[01:25:47] <rubiksdream> *problem
[01:26:16] <rubiksdream> as long as you have some predicate that can accept 'input' and 'turing machine' you can ask 'does turing machine halt on input' and exists input, 'does turing machine halt on input'
[01:26:28] <rubiksdream> and thats is not computable by the halting problem

[01:28:03] <riv> FO plus a 2-ary predicate symbol is undecidable
[01:28:10] <riv> you need the 2-ary to build lists, I think

[07:12:43] <brownorange> To re-iterate conditions from before:
[07:12:43] <brownorange> 1) There is a successor function f(x) = x + 1. 2) There are defined numerals that abbreviate for uses of this function. 1 := s(0), 2 := s(1) etc 3) you can setup statements like A+B=C 3) proofs are hilbert style 4) every proof is assured to have a provable closed form version meaning A |- B, must also mean |- (A -> B)
[07:13:40] <brownorange> so if a formal system capable of expressing arithmetic also meets those conditions and is complete, i'd be proven wrong (assuming it had no contradictions)
[07:16:58] <brownorange> i can't tell if presburger satisfies the conditions because its would-be successor function appears to be replaced with mathematical induction.

[07:23:15] <PlanckWalk> If alOh then yes, Presburger arithmetic can express all sentences of the form A+B=C
[07:23:53] <PlanckWalk> And yes, "x+1" expresses "successor to x"

[07:32:08] <brownorange> that might be why its complete. my claim is arithmetic is incomplete when you start with an actual successor function, then using the formal system try to prove results like A+B=C. The reason is oversaturation of possible proofs for any positive integer solution
[07:32:45] <PlanckWalk> You can fairly trivially rewrite Presburger arithmetic to include a successor function symbol

[11:25:51] <riv> > In March 2018, Peter Scholze and Jakob Stix visited Kyoto for discussions with Mochizuki.[31][32] While they did not resolve the differences, they brought them into clearer focus. Scholze and Stix wrote a report asserting and explaining an error in the logic of the proof and claiming that resulting gap was "so severe that … small modifications will not rescue the proof strategy";[33] Mochizuki claimed that they misunderstood vital aspects of th
[11:25:51] <riv> e theory and made invalid simplifications.[34][35][36]

[12:15:52] <gas51627> I am recently stuck with a thing, I don't understand how to bridge the gap between simple statements, like P is true/false and the statement with a variable P(x).
[12:17:17] <gas51627> I mean, for example, if you have a statement P(x) -> Q . Then it means that for some x Q may be false, while for others not
[12:19:33] <acresearch> causative_: carlino3 ok what if therectangle touches the circle edges,,, how can i solve it in this situation?
[12:22:10] <carlino3> acresearch yes i realize that a bit later. nevermind.
[12:22:25] <carlino3> acresearch do you have a photo or graphic representing the issue?
[12:23:21] <acresearch> carlino3: no,,, i did take some photos of the cells just to make sure of the measurements, but i deleted them
[12:23:24] <taeaad> HisShadow: Alright. Perhaps the conjecture should then be mentioned somewhere in the correspondence.
[12:23:48] <acresearch> carlino3: i was hoping to calculate the pixel size mathematically rather than my meauring on the image
[12:24:20] <carlino3> yes of course

[12:44:12] <riv> that is good because all variables are quantified

[16:10:44] <rubiksdream> cherim___ never mind, i resolved my question, what I was asking was actually way too general
[16:11:45] <rubiksdream> what I really needed was : Let f : D -> U be a conformal map of the unit disk onto some simply connected (proper) region, then if the largest disk centered at f(0) has radius exactly |f'(0)|/4 (and not more), then U is a slit plane
[16:11:51] <rubiksdream> which is much more specific
[16:12:43] <rubiksdream> which comes from koebe-1/4-theorem, because if the largest disk centered at f(0) has that radius exactly, its possible to show f is a rotation of the koebe-function

[16:33:42] <int-e> gas51627: sorry I only read the first part of your last message
[16:33:48] <Inline> given that y will really tutor someone
[16:34:29] <int-e> "if someone got a D, then y will tutor someone who got a D" is indeed captured by ∃z(z got D → y will teach z), though that is somewhat subtle.
[16:34:33] <gas51627> it's like having someone who will tutor z who got D forces that there is a z who got D
[16:34:36] <Inline> if there no one with D and y will not teach anyone the implication is still true
[16:35:07] <int-e> the direct translation would be ∃z(z got D) → ∃z(z got D and y will teach z)
[16:35:08] <Inline> F -> F (true)
[16:35:32] <int-e> but you can use the same z for both existentials and then it simplifies to ∃z(z got D → y will teach z)

[16:35:48] <int-e> Actually, no, it doesn't
[16:36:06] <gas51627> imagine there is one z who didn't get D
[16:36:06] <int-e> I'm confusing myself here. ∃z(z got D → y will teach z) is true if there's any student who didn't get a D.

[16:55:54] <int-e> gas51627: Things like that do happen in real life though. It's perfectly normal to make a *plan* like "after the test, we'll pair up students who got an A with students who got a D for tutoring" and then realize after the test that this isn't possible, and adjust the plan.
[16:56:42] <int-e> But there's a time component to this, and unknowns, neither of which are captured in precicate logic.
[16:57:17] <int-e> (without some serious effort involving special predicates talking about time and choices)
[16:57:49] <PlanckWalk> riv: Well, "even" just means "divisible by 2", so yuo're saying "isn't it odd that 2 is the only prime divisible by 2?"
[16:58:10] <int-e> yes, 2 is the odd prime.
[16:58:11] <PlanckWalk> But now that doesn't look so odd because you can substitute any other prime for 2 and still get a true statement.
[16:58:33] <gas51627> the drinker paradox seems a nonsense to me
[16:58:35] <PlanckWalk> "Isn't it odd that 997 is the only prime divisible by 997?"
[16:58:39] <gas51627> it's clearly false
[16:58:49] <gas51627> if there are 2 person in the pub, one is drinking another is not
[16:58:52] <gas51627> then it's false
[16:58:53] <PlanckWalk> Yes, it's clearly false because the pub might be empty.
[16:59:08] <int-e> gas51627: the implication of formal logic has *nothing* to do with causality
[16:59:30] <int-e> gas51627: and the drinker's paradox is one of the best examples I know of to drive this point home
[16:59:37] <gas51627> ah you are right
[16:59:40] <PlanckWalk> It is a pretty good example yes
[16:59:44] <gas51627> if at least one person not drinking
[16:59:47] <gas51627> then it's true
[16:59:54] <gas51627> and if everyone is drinking it's also true

[17:18:01] <gas51627> I understand, what I don't get is the idea that all free variables "must be" quantified
[17:18:55] <gas51627> another thing: P(x) -> Q and ∃xP(x) -> Q seem to be totally equivalent to me
[17:19:19] *** Joins: hanif (~hanif@gateway/tor-sasl/hanif)
[17:19:52] <riv> the first is missing a quantifier for x
[17:19:55] <int-e> ∀x(P(x)→Q) and ∃xP(x)→Q are equivalent.
[17:20:00] <riv> so x is a free variable
[17:20:09] <riv> often in math we implicitly quantify things
[17:20:22] <riv> but formally you need to have all free variables quantified
[17:20:32] <gas51627> I understand what a free variables is, what I don't get is why all variables should be quantified
[17:20:43] <riv> if they are not quantified you just have a free variable
[17:20:50] <gas51627> int-e: exactly, why is ∀ not implied?
[17:20:56] <riv> there aren't logical proof rules to deal with that
[17:20:57] <int-e> it's a formal requirement for a formula to be a sentence.
[17:21:03] <int-e> gas51627: no, it's not.
[17:21:20] <riv> we know how to prove 'forall x, P(x)' and we know how to prove 'exists x, P(x)'
[17:21:23] <gas51627> int-e: i mean, if I write P(x) , i imply all x
[17:21:26] <riv> we don't have any way to prove 'P(x)'
[17:21:46] <Inline> heh
[17:21:55] <riv> if by P(x) we are just doing shorthand, and it really means 'exists x, P(x)' then you can use the exists proof rule
[17:22:12] <gas51627> riv: hm
[17:22:19] <riv> do you get that formally we need all quantifiers explicitly written out
[17:22:28] <riv> but informally, we can be implicit and save time by not writing them
[17:22:33] <int-e> gas51627: You don't want to leave the meaning of that free variable to the context.
[17:23:02] <Inline> but then you have to make it explicit that P(x) means exists x P(x) at least once in your text
[17:23:05] <gas51627> riv: actually I don't get. So far today is the first time I heard that all free variables should be quantified
[17:23:12] <Inline> at the beginning or so
[17:23:17] <riv> ok
[17:23:30] <gas51627> ok, so basically by adding quantifiers, we making things explicit

[17:23:49] <Inline> well what's the opposite of a free variable ?
[17:23:53] <riv> a bound variable
[17:24:08] <int-e> Inside proofs, there are usually different kind of free variables: "arbitrary but fixed" values that can later be universally quantified, and other fixed values, usually witnesses of existential statements. (If you have ∃xP(x), then you can get a y with P(y) from that).
[17:24:37] <int-e> This is okay, because in the context of the proof you'll always know which kind of variable you have, for each free variable.
[17:24:41] <Inline> so with a bound variable you'd have no way of switching from x to y
[17:24:45] <int-e> Take the context away and you have a problem.

[17:30:04] <int-e> So there is another discrepancy between the rules of formal logic and how mathematical texts are written on the common, less formal, level.

[17:34:06] <gas51627> yeah, you see here lies the problem I have - what is the difference between truth value and a truth set. In the beginning I thought that truth set is more like truth value but for different values of x. But it seems that it's a completely different thing.
[17:34:30] <gas51627> Because truth value of P may be either true or false. But in a truth set the value is always true
[17:35:32] <int-e> gas51627: no, P(x) is false if x isn't in the set of objects that satisfy P.
[17:36:01] <gas51627> yeah I understand that
[17:36:13] <gas51627> but P can be true or false, right
[17:36:22] <gas51627> but for some reason P(x1) may only be true
[17:36:27] <gas51627> that doesn't make sense
[17:36:58] <gas51627> or maybe the truth set says about the "current" value
[17:37:01] *** Joins: oxum (~oxum@106.203.222.191)
[17:37:10] <gas51627> and truth value says about "possible" value
[17:37:38] <gas51627> how would the truth table for P(x) look like
[17:38:22] <int-e> There's something non-trivial happening here, btw. There's the formula, P(x), which has a free variable, x. And then there's the semantics of that formula (which depends on a model). That semantics can be captured by the set of values of x that make P(x) a true statement. So... in order to fully make that distinction we'd have to talk about models and define semantics by some structural recursion...
[17:38:28] <int-e> ...on the formula. (And you /will/ most likely do that sooner or later.)
[17:38:41] <rubiksdream> you also have in any structure of the language S, S|=P(x) iff S|=forallx.P(x),
[17:39:10] <rubiksdream> so in some sense P(x) and forallx.P(x) are pretty similar
[17:41:56] <gas51627> int-e: is there an introduction to that thing?
[17:42:12] <int-e> gas51627: when talking about these things, we very often don't state whether we're talking about the syntactic level (P(x) as a formula) or the semantic level... even though it's a big source of potential confusion.

[18:05:49] <int-e> tolarz: you have a very interesting bootstrapping process to go through... the language for defining the semantics of predicate logic is set theory, and you need a firm grasp on logical connections, quantifiers, predicates and functions to do that with sufficient level of confidence.
[18:05:58] <rubiksdream> btw, this is still open (well i haven't thought about it since i last asked about it) 'Are the structures <N,x |-> x^3> and <N,x|->x^2> elementarily equivalent'?

[18:07:00] <gas51627> haha
[18:07:20] <rubiksdream> its like a very weak set theory isnt it
[18:07:28] <rubiksdream> in my mind its basically 'theory of sequences'
[18:08:11] <rubiksdream> but actually not really, to define a model (L-structure) you formally need to be working in some form of set theory

[21:32:21] <usr123> Hello, I'm reading Addison-Wesley Introductory Mathematics. I'm having a hard time understanding this part: https://imgur.com/a/ljglvIs , first of all, why is it that in the previous pages they plot negative numbers to the right of zero and the image I posted -a is plotted to left of zero. Secondly, from the line represented here, how is it deduced that a = -(-a) ?
[21:32:53] <usr123> In the previous pages they tell how - means moving units to the left of the number line and + means moving units to the right of the number line.
[21:33:17] <usr123> So how are they deducing from that line that a = -(-a) ?
[21:34:19] <usr123> Also the notion of multiplication has not been introduced in the book until now.
[21:36:35] <usr123> I'm sort of looking for a better explanation for the direction method answer given here: https://www.quora.com/How-can-we-prove-a-a#:~:text=From%20the%20axiom%20of%20the,existence%20of%20the%20neutral%20element, I'm unable to make intuitive sense out of it.
[21:37:08] <Z-module> the notation  -a   does not mean that -a is a negative number, here. It merely means it is on the opposite side of 0 from a, by the same distance.
[21:37:45] <Z-module> in that diagram, where -a is on the right of 0, this implies that a itself must be negative.

[21:39:10] <usr123> Z-module: I'm sorry, I didn't understand your second message.
[21:43:10] <Z-module> You are right that on previous pages, negative values are plotted to the left (that's where we do it). You are not right that this Fig. 1-3 contradicts that practice: the number  -a   is not negative, in spite of having a minus sign present.
[21:43:17] <Z-module> the point is that the value of a itself is negative
[21:43:55] <Z-module> so if a happens to be -3, then -a is -(-3) = 3 which is positive
[21:45:07] <Z-module> (you actually wrote "and the image I posted  -a is plotted to left of zero." but you meant right, not left)
[21:45:23] <usr123> Yeah, I was wrong there, my bad.
[21:45:40] <Z-module> oh wait, *and* you said previously negatives are on the right. Hopefully you meant left.
[21:46:05] <Z-module> (you might be dyslexic)
[21:46:13] <usr123> What I fail to visualize is how is -(-3) equal to 3?
[21:47:06] <usr123> Z-module: maybe just not attentive. My bad, I meant to say in previous pages all negative numbers are to the left and in the image I posted it's towards the right.

[21:48:09] <Z-module> -(anything) is on the opposite side of 0 from the (anything), at the same distance.  So -(-3) is on the opposite side -- meaning right side -- from 0 as -3 is (which is on the left side). Since -3 is 3 units away from 0 to the left, then -(-3) is 3 units away from 0 to the right. That's exactly where 3 is.
[21:48:15] <usr123> And that's only the little part. What I don't see is how does -(-a) become a? -a means the we move "a" units to the left. So what does -(-a) mean? That we move in the opposite direction of left?
[21:48:18] *** Joins: Imk0tter (~Imk0tter@172.58.228.76)
[21:49:29] <usr123> Oh, I think I'm beginning to see what you're saying.
[21:49:37] <usr123> I'll read that a couple more times.
[21:49:39] <Z-module>  -(...)  means use the opposite side from the (...), *whichever* side (...) is on.
[21:49:48] <Z-module> - does not itself indicate a fixed direction.
[21:50:08] <usr123> Z-module: Yes. Yes, that makes sense.
[21:51:43] <usr123> Am I too dumb? Will I survive math? It's always been a weakness of mine, but now I want to get good at it and get a degree in it.
[21:51:45] <Z-module> so in the case of  -(-a)   the outer - there is not "paying any attention" to the inner - there, as a symbol. You're merely noting which side of 0 the -a point is on, and now switching to the opposite side.

[22:28:04] <TOB_CyxoB> usr123, I see. There are so many ways to think about this kind of stuff, just choose the one that makes more sense to you. Addition means putting things together, subtraction means taking things away. But your book makes a good point in the sense that you can think of it as moving in some direction. So moving forward is + and let's say going back is -. But what is going back backwards -(-a)? It is simply moving forward a units.
[22:28:04] <TOB_CyxoB> :) Hope it is not more confusing...
