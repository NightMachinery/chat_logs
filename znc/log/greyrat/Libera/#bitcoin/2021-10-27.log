[06:26:55] <yanmaani> s17: yes, but it's a moderated list
[06:27:00] <yanmaani> they hold all messages for a while before posting
[06:27:13] <yanmaani> there is a human being looking over these posts
[06:27:24] <yanmaani> and deciding that some of them are good enough
[06:27:27] <yanmaani> this is not, frankly, the case
[06:27:51] <s17> ok
[06:30:01] <s17> maybe you can post to the list and ask that question
[06:30:11] <s17> idk if that is allowed
[06:30:19] <yanmaani> good idea, might do that actually

[22:53:20] <ldiamond> Models suggest BTC going up well beyond 100k USD. How do you think that works with the price of power? Does a doubling in value essentially equal a doubling in energy consumption? Wouldn't a 1M BTC cause energy shortage?
[22:54:20] <Librarian> No; the proof-of-work algorithm automatically adjusts to the processing power that's expended on it.
[22:54:51] <Librarian> If fewer people mine because electricity becomes more expensive, then the difficulty required to add a block to the blockchain also goes down.

[22:58:57] <bugs_> and we already have energy shortage/blackouts in many countries
[22:59:09] <bugs_> (usually the ones that have subsidized electric costs)
[22:59:44] <ldiamond> Librarian: right, but that's not what I'm talking about. Say electricity is 1$/kwh at 60k BTC. if BTC gets to 120k, miners are willing to pay twice the amount in electricity to keep their margins. Until the price of electricity reaches 2$/kwh, they'll keep adding more hashrate.
[22:59:46] <bugs_> so that is the new normal and will become quit common regardless of what happens with bitcoin
[23:01:25] <ldiamond> bugs_: If we already have shortages, then it'll only cause more issues.
[23:02:11] <bugs_> once vast areas go dark (see china) bitcoin can no longer cause more issues
[23:02:43] <ldiamond> How so?
[23:03:07] <bugs_> perhaps china can turn the power off after they've turned the power off
[23:03:24] <ldiamond> Well, #1, you already can't mine in China.
[23:03:50] <ldiamond> #2, having blackouts doesn't mean mining doesn't increase the electricity cost
[23:04:10] <ldiamond> #3, cutting off power to mining could severly compromise the network's security
[23:11:37] <ldiamond> The solution would be to reduce reward faster than initially scheduled.
[23:11:53] <Librarian> ldiamond, increased demand for something when supply is fixed causes the price to go up..
[23:12:06] <ldiamond> Exactly
[23:12:38] <Librarian> So the answer to your question is "no."
[23:13:10] <ldiamond> Your previous comment suggests the answer is "Yes."
[23:13:28] <Librarian> Please read the first word of my first comment again. :D
[23:13:29] <ldiamond> More incentive to mine means more miners and more power demand.
[23:14:29] <Librarian> But increased price due to increased demand means less incentive to mine.
[23:14:54] <ldiamond> Exactly what I said before, doubling of BTC price would result in doubling energy price.
[23:15:02] <Librarian> So those different incentives balance out somewhat.
[23:15:40] <ldiamond> But they don't, because no government will let people run out of power because only BTC miners are able to pay for it.
[23:15:45] <Librarian> And mining's biggest profits can only be realized where the margins are largest; ie. where there is already a surplus of power. (Like using geothermal engergy sources in Greenland for example.)

[23:16:41] <Librarian> Governments cause power outages all the time. That's true with or without bitcoin.
[23:16:47] <ldiamond> That's no longer the case when BTC price triples.
[23:16:59] <Librarian> BTC's price has already tripled.
[23:17:10] <Librarian> Several times.
[23:17:17] <Librarian> So, you have the answer to your question.
[23:19:06] <ldiamond> And its energy consumption has now become significant.
[23:20:11] <Librarian> That's fine.
[23:20:45] <Librarian> I see a lot of criticism of bitcoin for using electricity, but what those critics are missing is that the power expended on proof-of-work *is* the underlying tangible asset that gives it value.
[23:21:04] <Diablo-D3> yeah, its a common tactic Librarian
[23:21:08] <Librarian> Complaining about that would be as stupid as saying, "using gold as money is bad because it uses up so much gold!" :D
[23:21:10] <Diablo-D3> they just undermine the mining.
[23:21:15] <Librarian> Yeah, that's the whole point. :D
[23:21:40] <ldiamond> That's not really my point though, if it prices common people out of electricity, there will be consequences.
[23:22:06] <Librarian> Of course. All economic activity has consequences.
[23:22:08] <ldiamond> Replace "gold" with "water" in your comment.
[23:22:14] <Librarian> But economic activity is not a zero-sum game.
[23:22:14] <dodo> lol. bitcoin energy usage is negligible on a global scale
[23:22:23] <Diablo-D3> dodo: it really is
[23:22:26] <Diablo-D3> but they like to make up shit
[23:22:31] <Diablo-D3> and they also lie about where it comes from
[23:22:41] <Diablo-D3> like a lot of smaller miners in the far north... heat their house with it.
[23:22:43] <dodo> "it uses as much as a country!!!!1"
[23:22:45] <Librarian> Replacing "gold" with "electricity" and "water" is the same. If it has value, and can be tokenized as money, that's great.
[23:23:01] <Diablo-D3> which means their energy now has a negative cost... else it would have just used to heat the house and no other work
[23:23:05] <dodo> bitcoin doesn't produce energy anyway, it consumes. blame the producers for being "dirty"
[23:23:12] <ldiamond> If you take all water from people, they will kill you.
[23:23:15] <Diablo-D3> certainly a minority in bitcoin,but still done
[23:23:17] <Librarian> It's far more secure for using gold/water/electricity than just inflating away the savings of our most productive citizens.
[23:23:38] <Librarian> ldiamond, you can't take all water from people, any more than you can take all electricity from people.

[23:24:07] <Librarian> You can always desalinize more seawater, and you can always produce more electricity.
[23:24:27] <Librarian> How many people here are making their own captive electricity right on their own property, right now? <raises own hand>
[23:25:23] <Librarian> Yet, if you try to do that with fiat US dollars, men with guns will come and kill you.
[23:25:28] <ldiamond> Librarian: It's far from easy to produce more electricity.
[23:25:32] <Librarian> Bitcoin is a great democratizer, or decentralizer.
[23:25:48] <AndyS2_> ldiamond: you forgot the reward halvings every 4 years
[23:26:01] <Librarian> "Easy" is relative. I think it's probably easier than mining gold.
[23:26:05] <AndyS2_> ldiamond: if it takes 4 years for bitcoin to go from 60k to 120k, then nothing changes
[23:26:15] <AndyS2_> (roughly)
[23:26:17] <ldiamond> AndyS2_: I didn't forget it. I talked about it saying it should be done faster in case of power price spikes.
[23:26:30] <ldiamond> Rather, in case of BTC causing power price spikes
[23:26:32] <dodo> um, wat
[23:26:34] <Librarian> Well, you can't do it faster. Nobody grants that authority to you.
[23:26:45] <dodo> power prices are political anyway
[23:26:54] <Librarian> So that's an idea that just cannot work, at all, period.
[23:27:11] <AndyS2_> ldiamond: you can't just convert all electricity to bitcoin, anyway. there's not enough chip production to keep it that flexible, and there's a risk in buying lots of mining hardware in case the price drops
[23:27:20] <ldiamond> If people stop crying about nuclear, then that would probably make things much easier.
[23:27:47] <AndyS2_> meh, all the nuclear fanboys forget that you have to transport the fuel or microreactors
[23:28:00] <AndyS2_> (or protect the reactors from manipulation)
[23:28:26] <Librarian> That's doable.
[23:28:40] <AndyS2_> but you do you and destroy your land. incentives for power plant workers are all wrong, too
[23:28:41] <ldiamond> AndyS2_: it remains that BTC mining is about converting energy to money. Higher reward = higher energy demand.

[23:29:15] <AndyS2_> ldiamond: absolutely. but there's a limit to how much bitcoin can go up, and how fast you can churn out chips
[23:29:28] <Librarian> ldiamond, you were already told how higher bitcoin price does not match 1:1 with higher reward.
[23:29:31] <AndyS2_> even if we went to 10% for bitcoin power consumption, do you really think it'd matter?
[23:29:33] <Librarian> Would you like me to explain it to you again?
[23:31:11] <AndyS2_> people who make more money through mining can also outbid you when they buy new hardware, so there's still a huge incentive to get cheap power, and not buy up expensive power. I wonder if bitcoin won't just increase the availability of cheap power vs 'sucking it all up'

[23:37:40] <Librarian> Love that picture that was floating around social media a few years ago: "Nuclear energy is so dangerous, we make 19-year-olds run the plants straight out of high school." with a picture of an aircraft carrier. :)
[23:42:07] <ldiamond> it takes 10+ years because of all the FUD around it.
[23:43:10] <Librarian> I could imagine 10+ years to design, model, and mature a repeatable architecture, but then an assembly line that can spit out one per day or more. :)
[23:43:35] <AndyS2_> ldiamond: nuclear and solar energy share that problem ;)
[23:44:24] <AndyS2_> we could be further concerning the storage of regenerative energy, or putting wind turbines in places to power Europe day and night
[23:44:51] <AndyS2_> if it's not a solution going forward because of the FUD in the past, why bother? The best option wins, and it seems to be regenerative
[23:44:59] <earnestly> I wonder how much c4 would be required to take down a wind turbine
[23:45:00] <AndyS2_> because we need power now
[23:45:21] <earnestly> Or well placed damage to the base
[23:45:22] <Librarian> I like the idea of reservoirs at high and low elevations, and store energy by pumping water from low to high, and generating more with turbines as water flows from high to low.
[23:45:45] <AndyS2_> earnestly: in any case they are far enough away from living people that the turbines probably won't hit a human. putting a nuclear power plant far away enough might not be possible :P
[23:46:11] <earnestly> wind turbines have killed more people than nuclear
[23:46:15] <Librarian> earnestly: very little. C4 is incredibly potent stuff, and the area of the base of a wind turbine is very small. But why would anyone want to?
[23:46:23] <earnestly> Librarian: To remove them

[23:46:49] <Librarian> That isn't done with buildings today, except perhaps by the occasional psychopath.
[23:47:02] <Librarian> Oh, sorry, should ask first: are you, by any chance, a psychopath?
[23:47:10] <Librarian> They say 1 in 100 of the population is.
[23:47:27] <AndyS2_> I did read the argument that one problem for nuclear was that they couldn't make them bigger because the base load wasn't high enough, and running lots of bitcoin asics would solve that (i.e. you could build super big nuclear reactors more easily, making it even cheaper)
