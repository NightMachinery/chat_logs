[00:01:01] <s33ker> bookworm is this document only talking about joining with index because i actually need to join them on value so   blue = blue and 2020.11.2 = 2020.11.2
[00:01:07] <grym> flask or fastAPI + sqla-core is technically no-ORM
[00:01:34] <CodeSpelunker> some of them are geared around ORM and stuff which I don't need, and others just suggest spinning up a new db connection on each API route, which feels wrong
[00:01:35] <bookworm> s33ker: no, join is using the index, merge can, well, merge on any column
[00:01:39] <han-`1> maybe werkzeug?

Ideally, I would like to be able to have a python script in dir/bin be able to import a python module from dir/lib but python(3) doesn't support importing from parent directories without appending to sys.path from what I can find.

[02:05:23] <JayDoubleu> Is there an easy way to serve entire directory under given path using http.server ?
[02:05:59] <KnowledgeShark> good afternoon everyone. I am working on a python script that reads a json to a python dictionary and then writes to MariaDB using sqlalchemy. I can get it to work until I hit a specific json key (in my dictionary). How do I drop a specific key from the python dictionary once it is created from a json file read? And part 2: What's the correct datatype to store an array of URLS that are surrounded between [] brackets. I receive a choke 1064 error
[02:05:59] <KnowledgeShark> when sqlalchemy hits it. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated! Thank you all. My dpaste block of code is here: https://dpaste.com/F5JPZG9XW

[05:01:46] <Lerroux> I’m creating a function that uses cv2 to read a QR Code. While that works, there are instances that it fails due to the QR being printed with lower resolution. Now I see that when using Gaussian Blur, most of the QR code I tried now works except for a very few. My solution is: https://bpa.st/FEOQ – Is there a way I can make that better and more “Pythonic”?

[05:39:08] <KirkMcDonald> It's global mutable state that's a problem.

[05:41:05] <KirkMcDonald> Conjecture: In C, you declare variables, and which names refer to which declarations is resolved at compilation time.
[05:41:28] <Conjecture> In C, you must declare variables before the code that uses them

[07:32:07] <Henry151> one is, instead of using selenium to submit the form over and over with different values, instead do the "mining" locally with python, so scrape the webpage once to get the pieces of info, i.e. the previous block hash, the difficulty target, the merkle root hash, and the version; then do the mining locally with hashlib

[07:51:28] <Henry151> in fact at the conference thing, we had multiple people find different correct answers within a couple minutes, just manually typing in different guesses
[07:53:18] <nz> Is this backed by a REST API? You might be able to eschew selenium+frontend entirely
[07:53:27] <Henry151> i just found the answer to a second one of the challenges, by doing range in order from 0, it was like 1593 or something. So part of me thinks that could be more effective, to just go in order from 0, but a bigger, smarter part of me knows that trying random numbers between 0 and 4bil should hit a correct answer sooner on average than trying every number from 0 to 4bil
[07:53:47] <Henry151> nz: i don't think so, it looks like it's happening in browser with some sort of javascript thingy i think
[07:54:17] <nz> Ah right. Hence your comment about just scraping the page and running the whole computation python-side
[07:54:21] <Henry151> i do plan to do the other approach as well, like i mentioned, where i just scrape the page for the relevant numbers and then do all the math on my end, instead of submitting a guess and letting the browser/webpage tdo it
[07:54:25] <Henry151> exactly
[07:55:00] <Henry151> i just want to have a "nice, well thought-out, good-looking version" of both approaches, and i think that guessing randomly is probably much faster than going in order through a range
[07:55:20] <nz> If you say so
[07:55:54] <Henry151> maybe i could do something like "first try guessing randomly in the range of 0 to 4000, then try guessing randomly in the range of 4000 to 8000, ....." all the way up, so that i'm only holding 8000 numbers in memory at any given moment
[07:55:59] *** Quits: nomic (~nomic@85.203.36.247) (Quit: Leaving)
[07:57:15] <Henry151> well i mean if there are many many correct guesses between 0 and 4bil (which there must be, i imagine, if i'm able to hit two correct guesses starting from 0 before i get to 2000, i think) than it makes sense to me that guessing randomly from the whole 4bil should be faster than going in order from 0
[07:57:19] *** Joins: han-solo (~hanish@user/han-solo)
[07:57:20] <Henry151> but maybe i am wrong

[08:03:47] <Henry151> well, if for example there happen to be 25,000 correct nonces, that all lie between 4mil and 4bil, than if you start guessing random numbers between 0 and 4bil, you'll hit one before me, if i start guessing at 0 and work my way up

[08:04:23] <Henry151> if i'm not mistaken, i think the distribution of the nonces is super random
[08:04:33] <nz> it is
[08:04:38] <Henry151> due to the sha-256 algorithm being so super random
[08:04:39] <nz> most hashing algorithms tend to have such tiny bias
[08:05:02] <nz> Since it's super random, you are no better off guessing randomly compared to walking from 0 to 4 billion

[08:05:52] <Henry151> i think that when we say it is super random, it's not meaning "the correct nonces are evenly distributed between 0 and 4bil" at all, right? it means they may all be clustered down near 0, or they may all be clustered up near 4bil, or anything inbetween those two extremes, or no clusters, or multiple clusters randomly distributes

[08:06:18] <Henry151> hmm
[08:06:39] <nz> if I roll a die 6 times, the average roll will be a 3
[08:06:43] <Henry151> then starting at 0 and going up should hit one just as fast as starting at 4bil and working down, or random choice
[08:06:49] <nz> if I roll it 1000 times it'll still be 3
[08:07:10] <nz> well 3.5 unless the die starts at 0 :)
[08:07:18] <nz> Henry151, exactly
[08:08:09] <Henry151> i wonder, when ASIC miners are actually trying to mine bitcoin, if they're doing the random-number-between-this-and-that approach, or if they're doing the "start at 0 and try every number heading up towards 4bil" approach, or if there's some other approach i haven't considered yet
[08:08:27] <Henry151> maybe they're trying both at once, or "all of the above at once"
[08:08:56] <nz> I'm not au fait with bitcoin mining in specific, but I've done some RSA mining stuff in the past. Twiddling nonses is normally done sequentially
[08:08:58] <Henry151> i.e. have multiple processors and one starts at 0 and goes up, one starts at 100 and goes down, one starts at 100 and goes up, one starts at 200 and goes down, etc

[08:09:42] <nz> if a hashing algorithm had meaningful bias, it wouldn't be a very secure hashing algorithm
[08:10:27] <nz> hence it all boils down to a random guess on a random number will, on average, not beat a sequential guess on a random number
[08:10:28] <Henry151> and i think it's been established that bitcoins hashing algorithm is a very secure one
[08:10:50] <nz> You could write yourself a python program to prove it to yourself :)

But having wget as a dependency makes it very hard to properly package the library for distribution. Does anyone know of a native python library that can handle those quirks well?

[13:13:30] <wyre> I guys, I've got a cross dependency issue, I've got a custom package that depends on another just for tests, but the other package needs the first one as runtime dependency. When I generate the dev-requirements.txt with pip-compile --extra dev (to include also the extras_require, where is the dependency of the second package for tests), pip-compile pins an old version of itself for the first one
[13:13:32] <wyre> package in its dev-requirements.txt (because of the second one depends on this older version of the first one)
[13:13:38] <Falc> In this particular case I might go for a NamedTuple. It's just that I keep remembering it exists, and then not using it and then forgetting about it for the umpteenth time. Frustrating.
[13:15:34] <wyre> just to clarify: library v0.0.22 depends on package v2.0.8, but package v2.0.8 depends on library v0.0.21, so when I use pip-compile in the library repo ... I can see also a dependency for library v0.0.21 resolved through package v2.0.8 dependency of library v0.0.21

[20:12:42] <grym> GrandPa-G: sets are unique
[20:12:46] <feral_hedgehog> So we have this Docker image that we develop on, and in its Dockerfile is a call to pip install with a requirements.txt where all package versions are hardcoded.
[20:12:53] <feral_hedgehog> The problem is that sometimes when the image is rebuilt (for unrelated changes) and our python stuff stops working.
[20:12:56] <grym> GrandPa-G: so if you add 0 twice (ie, with {False, 0}), you only get one kept
[20:13:02] <feral_hedgehog> We think that it's because we don't put ALL of our dependencies in the requirements.txt, and during the rebuild something, somewhere with a different version gets installed and breaks things.

[20:49:16] <Adoi> I mean, in order to give full path, how do I find out what the full path of the file in question is?
[20:50:10] <exarkun> That doesn't sound like something to find out.  That sounds like something you need to know already.  Earlier, it seemed like you did know.
[20:50:20] <grym> Adoi: you put the file there, right? you should know... or, you could pass the directory in, look at an environment variable to get it, ensure it's deterministically somewhere relative to your code that you can always know..
[20:50:28] <TML> os.path.realpath(__file__) is the full path to the currently running file
[20:50:46] <Adoi> I mean, of course I see where the file is, but I dont remember or want to type full tree

[20:57:53] <exarkun> Ok.  realpath(relative_path) constructs an absolute path by putting your pwd in front of the relative path.  What else could it do?
[20:58:23] <exarkun> TML and jinsun suggested you use `__file__` which is a special variable Python defines for you that is the absolute path to the source file it is referenced in.
[20:58:29] <TML> Adoi: os.path.realpath(__file__)
[20:58:34] <Adoi> but I 1) wanted to change pwd, originally 2) when we talked about using absolute path, we moved on to finding out where the file was. so my original problem is changing the pwd
[20:58:34] <TML> literally the string __file__
[20:58:41] <exarkun> Try os.path.realpath(__file__) and see how that compares to os.path.realpath("filename.py")

[21:58:44] <Xano> I'm using Babel to extract gettext translatables into *.pot files. Sometimes what happens is that certain messages or chunks of messages are moved to the end of the *.pot file and commented out in the process, or removed entirely. All while the source strings still exist in the code.

[23:44:54] <parv> Is map() not a loop even if one does not have to explicitly write it?
[23:45:15] <exarkun> it certainly has to visit each element to apply the function
[23:45:29] <exarkun> it could be recursive instead of iterative (but it isn't)
[23:45:36] <SnoopJ> parv, the implementation is probably doing a loop for you when you iterate a map(), if that's what you mean
[23:45:44] <exarkun> (bonus question: is recursion a loop?)
[23:45:51] <Ha-Jo> loop or not loop, anyway. I just anted a short solution.
[23:46:32] <SnoopJ> Ha-Jo, map() is one possibility but the comprehension phy1729 shared is a little more common (because it's a little easier to read)

[23:48:00] <parv> SnoopJ, Right. I am personally bothered when people asked for a solution without loop, but then solution preferred/accepted invariably uses a (hidden) loop anyway.
[23:48:55] <jinsun> if there is readymade function like int available then map is not too bad, if you need to write a lambda then it becomes really bad

[23:49:54] <exarkun> Yes.  Python lacks a lot of facilities for writing readable functional code.
[23:49:57] <parv> lambda function is rather restricted (in Python), (dare I ask) how bad could it be?
[23:50:13] *** Quits: Daemoen (~Daemoen@daemoen.ct-unlimited.com) (Quit: WeeChat 3.2)
[23:50:26] <exarkun> parv: It's only syntactically restricted.  You can still do arbitrary computation in a function defined with lambda.

[23:50:36] <exarkun> parv: So, it can be arbitrarily "bad" (that is, arbitrarily complex).

[23:51:38] <SnoopJ> jinsun, I find that even in that case, the fact that "how to do it" dominates the expression is still undesirable. But when map() strikes me as a good solution, I use it
