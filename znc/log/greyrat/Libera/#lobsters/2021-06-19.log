[04:04:28] <imode> you'd need to be able to derive other control flow constructs.

[04:04:51] <imode> structured lol.
[04:05:38] <edk> but if you don't count function calls as flow control, i think an infinite loop feels "more fundamental"

[05:23:01] <shapr> I have much more to say if you're interested :-)
[05:23:15] <Church> Howdy shapr
[05:23:21] <orochikaku> I've definitely heard of Linux from scratch but the rest is new to me
[05:23:22] <shapr> o hi Church, how's life?
[05:24:01] <shapr> orochikaku: sys admin / security / devops is three different areas from my viewpoint, do you have any more specific keywords?
[05:24:01] <Church> pushcx: Yeah qntm.org was pretty good about criticizing clean code.
[05:24:35] <shapr> orochikaku: at this particular moment, the programming language Go is gaining much popularity in the devops area
[05:24:40] <Church> shapr: Not bad, setting up Borg backup on my mail server.
[05:24:48] <shapr> ah, I need to move my mail server
[05:24:55] <Church> Finally got outbound smtp over wireguard working again.
[05:25:02] <Church> Yeah moved it inwards to my lan
[05:25:05] <shapr> huh, that's an idea I hadn't considered
[05:25:15] <orochikaku> I guess I'd just narrow it down to devops then, maintaining and deploying a fleet of containers sounds like my kinda jam
[05:25:17] <shapr> I could run my mail server on my laptop over wireguard
[05:25:20] <Church> With a small vps for proxying inbound and outbound connections.
[05:25:30] <Church> Heh is your laptop always on?
[05:25:36] <Church> Think you get penalized for down time
[05:25:41] <shapr> orochikaku: in that case I'd recommend learning Go the language, and studying kubernetes
[05:25:47] <orochikaku> raspi 0 makes for a perfect mail server
[05:25:55] <shapr> Church: I don't care, it's my domain and my email
[05:26:03] <shapr> I may go back to self-hosting my DNS server
[05:26:13] <orochikaku> Will do shapr
[05:26:34] <shapr> orochikaku: in any case, I strongly encourage you to dig into areas that do not look interesting at first
[05:26:40] <Church> Well true but what do you use it for? Outbound/inbound mail? Just for alerts?
[05:26:49] <shapr> Church: outbound and inbound mail
[05:27:12] <Church> Yeah so downtime can penalize you iirc wrt your mail being accepted.
[05:27:14] <shapr> it is frustrating when I can't reset my accounts because I broken my email server >:-(
[05:27:21] <shapr> Church: oh
[05:27:25] <shapr> fair enough
[05:27:25] <Church> Yeah I still need to move more stuff over

[05:27:43] <Church> Yeah don't take this as gospel. May he fud

[09:33:31] <quanticle> The Windows UI inconsistency, to me, is an extension of the "don't break userspace" policy that's led to a lot of the Linux syscalls looking similarly crufty
[09:33:32] <martian67|> you dont need loops for TC imode
[09:33:38] <martian67|> recursion for instance, is enough

[09:54:57] <imode> martian67|: that I understand, but "looping"/"repeated iteration" is the same thing as recursion in this context.
[09:55:13] <quanticle> This is how it looks on my terminal: https://i.imgur.com/WAbm3qb.png
[09:55:24] <imode> there's no real indication that that's possible in the pi calculus.
[09:55:34] <imode> though I don't understand the repeated process creation well enough.
[09:56:26] <fro> ha well i can see why me asking would make no sense at all
