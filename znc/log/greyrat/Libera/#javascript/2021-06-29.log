[00:15:37] <GreenJello> yeah, or even a PHP script that makes the request when called, and immediately returns the data it receives
[00:15:37] <ThePendulum> yes, you might be able to get it directly from that other website as well depending on their policies

[02:29:14] <Kremator> sure, i have a simple website, HTML, JS, CSS, nothing fancy, but i do use bootstrap, and BS uses JQuery, but since idk if the client entering my website will have external internet access (probably is going to be locked into a intranet) i would like my page to check up if BS and JQuery was loaded and if not, use a version "locally" downloaded in the same server where my website is

[02:32:38] <Kremator> GreenJello, because i though that would be a bad idea? i mean, in case the client have full internet access, wouldnt be better to rely on a CDN so it reduces the "usage" of the local server plus helping with caching in the client's browser?
[02:33:22] <Slade> Kremator, are you running this on a gen 1 raspberry pi?
[02:34:13] *** Joins: Gustavo6046 (~Gustavo60@user/gustavo6046)
[02:34:16] <Kremator> Slade, am not me, but idk which will be the final enviroment, im not the one into "deploying" this
[02:34:42] <GreenJello> the cache rate on public CDNs is really bad these days, and a local network is going to be faster than reaching out to the internet anyway
[02:35:01] <Slade> Kremator, this seems awfully complicated to save 60kb, which you'd end up going slower because you'd wan it out
[02:35:24] <Kremator> 60KB? more like 450KB
[02:35:47] <Kremator> gotcha, so y'all suggestions is to jsut move everything to "local" and be done with it?
[02:35:54] <Slade> bootstrap + jquery compressed == 450kb? wow..  still, not worth it
[02:35:55] <GreenJello> if you do have need for a CDN, you usually run your own and put all of your assets on it, which lets pipelining eliminate a lot of the work and reduces DNS lookups
[02:36:17] <Kremator> Slade, latest boostrap and jquery, but yeah
[02:36:19] <Slade> yea, especially with modern http protocols coming out
[02:36:21] <GreenJello> you can leave that up to the client if they're going to deploy it
[02:37:02] <Kremator> mmmm ok gotcha thank y'all for your suggestions, i've never been into the "deployment" side of things, always been a frontend
[02:37:33] <GreenJello> the other issue is that external requests don't always fail quickly, but rather might take minutes to time out, which would make it really hard to implement a fallback in that case

[02:39:01] <Kremator> GreenJello, oh sith, didnt consider that, yeah the JQuery load is sync, so if it is "slow" by any reason, the whole page will be blank for a few secs
[02:40:06] <Slade> <GreenJello> the other issue is that external requests don't always fail quickly, but rather might take minutes to time out, which would make it really hard to implement a fallback in that case   <-- especially annoying on hotel internets that proxy the connections :/

[03:53:47] <ljharb> even if its formatting choices aren't good
[03:53:48] <Donitz> eww, spaces plz
[03:53:55] <ljharb> spaces are for separating tokens
[03:53:58] <ljharb> tabs are for indentation
[03:54:02] <Donitz> you will be using spaces anyway, so why mix both
[03:54:03] <ljharb> don't be savages
[03:54:04] <Donitz> it's just confusing

[03:54:51] <gehn1> I know you believe what you believe, but you're demonstrably wrong on this
[03:54:57] <ljharb> there's linter rules, it's super easy to avoid mixing them
[03:55:08] <gehn1> you'd think that, but it doesn't work out in practice
[03:55:08] <ljharb> the only time you have to mix them is if you do something dumb like align your `=` signs
[03:55:10] <Donitz> haha
[03:55:14] <Donitz> my experience with python tells otherwise
[03:55:16] <ljharb> in practice it's worked out for me for my entire career
[03:55:20] <Donitz> even when I have spaces and tabs visible in my text editor
[03:55:21] <ljharb> ok, to be fair i don't use python
[03:55:29] <gehn1> and you don't have to mix them to align, because you just use spaces instead, problem solved
[03:55:31] <Donitz> I now enforce automatic conversion of tabs to spaces
[03:55:31] <ljharb> maybe python isn't as good as JS Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
[03:55:33] <Donitz> no more issues

[03:55:41] <gehn1> I don't
[03:55:51] <ljharb> Donitz: i mean obv either way you use a linter that forces the indentation you prefer

[03:56:14] <gehn1> maybe the only text editor in existence that can't handle inserting 4 spaces when you press TAB is notepad.exe
[03:56:34] <ljharb> that the editor can make your mistake less inconvenient isn't a rationale for the mistake
[03:56:50] <gehn1> wut? it's not about mistakes
[03:56:57] <ljharb> using spaces for indentation is a mistake :-)
[03:56:59] <Donitz> not even just the text editor. You just happily copy paste a single line of python and BAM
[03:57:02] <Donitz> mixed tabs and spaces again
[03:57:10] <gehn1> literally the only complaint that could maybe be legitimate about using spaces is the old "errh but I have to hit spacebar 4 times"
[03:57:12] <gehn1> and you don't
[03:57:19] <ljharb> Donitz: your editor would immediately autofix that with the linter
[03:57:29] <Donitz> and with automatic tab conversion
[03:57:32] <Donitz> way easier
[03:57:39] <gehn1> also python is better than JS for some things, worse for others
[03:57:43] <ljharb> a linter can convert in either direction, this is just a non-problem
[03:57:53] <ljharb> gehn1: there's much more than that

[03:58:53] <ljharb> JS did a lot right, but that isn't an intellectually honest argument that it does other things right. OTBS is still right tho.
[03:59:41] <gehn1> your analysis of my statements is off base
[03:59:53] <gehn1> I haven't made any kind of case for JS doing other things right because it did X right
[04:00:04] <Donitz> the pip ecosystem is healthier than npm
[04:00:05] <Donitz> so there is that
[04:00:14] <gehn1> healthier by what metric?
[04:00:40] <Donitz> smaller number of deps, plenty of large packages like numpy, matplotlib, jupyter
[04:00:54] <ljharb> that's not health
[04:00:57] <Donitz> it is
[04:00:59] <ljharb> more deps is better, smaller packages are better
[04:01:03] <Donitz> nope
[04:01:05] <ljharb> pip is garbage
[04:01:05] <gehn1> it's not health, no
[04:01:10] <gehn1> and yes pip is trash
[04:01:12] <ljharb> as is everything that's not npm, cargo, or nix
[04:01:19] <ljharb> so far those are the only three non-shitty package managers
[04:01:22] <Donitz> npm is a nightmare
[04:01:28] <gehn1> the main thing python has going for it is numpy, scipy, scikit-learn and matplotlib
[04:01:38] <ljharb> at worst it's a twilight pony

[04:25:58] <paule32> ah ok
[04:26:00] <ljharb> Donitz: nothing, but considering you can do `const opts = { ...options, ...defaults }; opts.width`, it's not the cleanest option

[04:26:16] <Donitz> with that solution, you must put all defaults in the same place
[04:26:26] <Donitz> but it may be more logical to have the default near the variable in question

[05:33:05] <ljharb> ahhh right
[05:33:26] <ljharb> ok so you want both all the results, and also for them to be serial?
[05:33:55] <ario_> yup
[05:36:08] <ljharb> ario_: so then `tasks.reduce(({ promises, prev }, task) => { const p = prev.then(() => task()); return { prev: p, promises: promises.concat(p) }, { promises: [], prev: Promise.resolve() }).then(({ promises, prev }) => prev.then(() => Promise.all(promises)))` maybe?
[05:36:16] <ljharb> certainly something you'd want behind an abstraction
[05:38:02] <ario_> hmm
[05:38:39] <GreenJello> it'd be cleaner to just push onto an array
[05:38:44] <ario_> yeah haha
[05:38:47] <ljharb> lol yeah
[05:38:58] <ljharb> i mean, `sequentialMap(tasks)` is clean regardless of the impl of that

[05:41:42] <ario_> oh interestting
[05:42:07] <ljharb> wroathe's is almost functional, because it uses .push, ie, it mutates

[05:57:49] <ljharb> without actually pipelining the result value?
[05:57:56] <ljharb> that implies the tasks are mutating shared state
[05:58:06] <ario_> unfortunately
[05:58:40] <ljharb> cause in that case they could also store the promise from their own work in that shared state

[16:08:06] <cthulchu> my wonderful folks, is there a native function in Date that would give me this: 2018-11-12T20:20:39+00:00
[16:09:23] <Cork> cthulchu: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toISOString
[16:11:06] <cthulchu> oh bravo!
[16:11:09] <cthulchu> many thanks
[16:11:32] <cthulchu> amazing
[16:11:44] <cthulchu> I almost started parsing the date manually
[16:12:10] <Cork> you mean generate?
[16:12:20] <Cork> cause that isn't a parser
[16:13:53] <cthulchu> huh, yes, I guess generate.
[16:13:59] <cthulchu> so I'm gonna do new Date().toISOString()
[16:14:14] <cthulchu> but I don't like that this involves the constructor and creation of an object
[16:14:19] <cthulchu> I don't like new
[16:14:38] <Cork> well that is how date works
[16:14:40] <cthulchu> is there in-line way? Like Date.now() and then something and then .toISOString()
[16:15:02] <Cork> n> (new Date()).toISOString()
[16:15:03] <jellobot> (okay) '2021-06-29T11:45:03.060Z'
[16:15:07] <cthulchu> I know
[16:15:29] <cthulchu> well ok
[16:15:44] <cthulchu> does Date.now() use the new behind the scenes?

[16:18:13] <deadbeat> cthulchu: the suggested polyfill for Date.now() is new Date().getTime(); So, it is an implementation detail of the js engine, but probably yes.
[16:19:17] <cthulchu> I see, thank you

[18:37:22] <banana_> ellipsis753: don't know but I know if you're on later there's devs here familiar with js tests
[18:37:35] <Kingsy> with nextjs, can I get the request headers without having to pass them around as props? I have an existing site, with a function that needs them. Its called by about 100 components, so I really don't want to have to modify all 100 components to pass them in#

[18:38:41] <banana_> Kingsy: in react there's composition I heard maybe there's something similar with nextjs
[18:39:41] <banana_> basically where all components get some object reference (property) by default

[18:47:49] <banana_> just update
[18:49:05] <banana_> like you could create another function that's exported from the same module called "updateHeader" if it's some global request header.
[18:49:19] <banana_> just a guess.

[18:53:58] <banana_> module's have their own scope that's maintained throughout the process of the application. so you could take advantage of that if you're using modules
[18:55:20] <banana_> same thing with functions when you create a function the function maintains it's scope. usually you don't want these side effects for functions so you don't take advantage of it.

[19:19:44] <paule32> hello
[19:19:44] <deadbeat> question i read in ##typescript: Does someone know the reason It's called every/some in js? I think all/any is way more fitting and basically used in almost every languages with those concepts. ljharb do you maybe know if any of the discussions around ecma 5 can be found online? My search skills did not turn up anything useful, i think the "proposal" system startet later on.
[19:20:02] <banana_> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toLocaleDateString ?

[19:24:36] <Cork> if you need to work a lot with date and time strings you want to use it
[19:25:08] <banana_> until Intl is useful

[19:25:38] <banana_> yeah but the js masters on here still say to use it.
[19:25:58] <Cork> also note there is https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat
[19:26:03] <banana_> they're just giving the heads up because it's the right nerdy thing to say. but a lot of people use it.
[19:26:06] <Cork> depending on what you need
[19:26:32] <deadbeat> until "Temporal" is available, i would not consider moment a bad choice, just wanted to add that information.
[19:26:40] <banana_> not all browsers support Intl right?
[19:27:32] <cthulchu> I see
[19:27:46] <cthulchu> is ES7 gonna bring some better interfaces to the Date?
[19:27:51] <banana_> but yeah use something instead of re-inventing the package. it's ok to use your own code sometimes though.

[23:40:54] <ljharb> without JS, there is no other option

[23:43:44] <ashnur> some stuff changes with css, but that's available statically too, if css for some reason is blocked or anything
[23:44:51] <ThePendulum> hmm so often people do `function foo() { if (condition) { return bar(); } ipsum(); };` when they want to break out of a function, even though they're not interested in the return value of bar(). I tend to avoid that and do `bar(); return;` so functions I don't expect to return something never do. is there something wrong with that reasoning?
[23:44:58] <ashnur> basically, either i am not using selects, or i am not doing progressive enhancement, or i am doing a backend for a task which has specified that i shouldn't do backend
[23:45:21] <ljharb> ashnur: it's not just about selects
[23:45:33] <ljharb> ashnur: any reactive UI can't be done without JS, so it requires a backend trip
[23:45:45] <ashnur> i know, but if i build it with inputs and other stuff, then i can avoid it
[23:45:47] <ljharb> ashnur: so if you can't tell the person who doesn't want backend handling it that they're wrong, then you can't do progressive enhancement
[23:45:51] <ljharb> ashnur: i suppose that's true
[23:46:09] <ljharb> ashnur: but it's pretty often that forms aren't refactorable in that way when they have these problems
