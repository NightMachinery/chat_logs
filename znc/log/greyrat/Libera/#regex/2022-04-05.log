[02:52:29] <AhmedAmerican> do you think it's a job of regex here https://regex101.com/r/2k9dct/1 to extract US address as i'm looking to extract  Address, Unit, City, State and Zip
[02:53:28] <OnlineCop> AhmedAmerican: Probably not, no.
[02:53:47] <OnlineCop> And definitely not by Python's `re` module.

[02:59:54] <AhmedAmerican> that's using regex module ?
[03:00:07] <OnlineCop> Should work in either.
[03:00:38] <OnlineCop> Regex101 is using the `re` module, so if you have Python selected, and it works, then it will work with either `re` or `regex`.
[03:03:34] <AhmedAmerican> it's working perfect. Thank you. but looks like the Unit is hard to catch
[03:04:19] <OnlineCop> 'address2' ?
[03:04:38] <AhmedAmerican> yes
[03:05:12] <OnlineCop> Why?
[03:05:26] <OnlineCop> When it's on its own line, or when it's part of the address?

[03:16:35] <AhmedAmerican> city/state/zip is always came after last `\\n`
[03:17:20] <OnlineCop> Line 44 contains a malformed address, so it doesn't match the others.

[08:31:33] <VectorX> there are already some issues related to .net so you can also check those out
[08:33:10] <re101-squid-5> basically as you can see in this screenshot this is exactly what i want to match and it appears correct in 101, https://snipboard.io/XuKUBY.jpg
[08:33:50] <re101-squid-5> but when put into a .net regex tester you can see the tagged group is also being matched on the first 15 interfaces when it should not be https://snipboard.io/UGHc9s.jpg
[08:35:00] <re101-squid-5> so not sure if its a bug with 101, and how to make it correclty match what i need in the other tester
[08:36:04] <re101-squid-5> here is the 101 link https://regex101.com/r/yNOc1m/2

[08:42:37] <re101-squid-5> yeah im very confused at how it is matching tagged to all interfaces when that string is not present in the frist 15
[08:42:52] <VectorX> beside something possibly wrong with your query, look at the data perhaps just the first section from line 1-11 and ask yourself which what do you think is correct
[08:46:06] *** Quits: jargon (~jargon@174-22-223-120.phnx.qwest.net) (Remote host closed the connection)
[08:46:53] <re101-squid-5> im a bit confused with what you mean sorry?
[08:46:53] <re101-squid-5> if i get rid of all the other payload data and just leave the first 11 lines the query does not match because the literal string in tagged its looking for is not there correct?
[08:50:32] <VectorX> the query matches fine, the content in tagged does not exist in the first block
[08:50:44] <VectorX> so http://regexstorm.net/tester appears to be giving wrong output
[08:51:14] <re101-squid-5> yeah i would agree, but when i implement it into my .net code it produces the same output as regexstorm
[08:52:14] <VectorX> right, this is what I meant but there could be something wrong in the regex itself
[08:53:01] <re101-squid-5> oh as in inside .net there regex has this bug? haha that sucks

[08:55:18] <VectorX> not regex but the regex pattern you have
[08:55:59] <VectorX> if the output is different it could also be a bug on the regex101 site, so feel free to create a ticket
[08:56:33] <re101-squid-5> so my query must be wrong then, and there might be a bug in the regex101
[08:57:12] <VectorX> well as the example i gave you looking at the first block of data, there is no tagged
[08:58:41] <VectorX> so it appears that all the content is scanned and the first match of tagged is added to all the other matches
[08:59:36] <re101-squid-5> yeah that is what i assumed to, do you have any idea on how to get around this? cause im stumped..

[09:02:06] <re101-squid-5> like the groups tagged and untagged are essentially the same, so why does untagged match the first 15 correclty then just ignore the next 3 correctly, but it doesnt happen fro tagged? haha very frustrating

[19:23:22] <Piush> space, ampersand and hyphen

[19:25:11] <JohnDoe1> try adding it to the character class [...]
[19:25:20] <JohnDoe1> but leave the hyphen at either the end of the character class or the beginning of it
[19:25:48] <JohnDoe1> if the hyphen is anywhere else it'll be interpreted as a range, like it is now for a-z (meaning any lowercase from a to z)
[19:26:36] <Piush> & is not allowing
[19:26:43] <Piush> it should allow ampersand
[19:26:46] <JohnDoe1> did you add & to the character class?
[19:27:51] <Piush> added
[19:27:55] <Piush> now its working file
[19:28:27] <JohnDoe1> the character class is considered an "or" list. So [ab] means either a or b. So if you want to match question marks too, you add "?" inside it, carefully leaving the hyphen at the beginning or end. If you no longer wish to match uppercase letters, you remove the A-Z part. And so on

[22:37:32] <purplex> xplorator, good name. Actually, that's a name I gave to one of my personal projects.
[22:38:03] <Tommy> Good morning.. 3AM in japan and I cant get to sleep until I solve this: https://regex101.com/r/XZC6Es/1 ... using php . The Challenge is to grab all the functions names and IF available also grab the query. In my example it should return 6 functions names with 2 function that have an empty query group. Thank you for reading this!
[22:39:46] <purplex> Looks that that may likely use recursion to match the curly braces.
[22:40:33] <purplex> Unless the ending } braces is always at start of a new line.
[22:43:24] <Tommy> recursion in regex can get quite complicated T_T . I think I would have to start over
[22:44:07] <Tommy> I was thinking of making the query group "optional" or writing a condition for the query group. what do you think of this kind of approach or is it nonsense?

[23:05:16] <Tommy> Xplorator thank you so much for the offer. I think +purplex solution will work out pretty since curly braces should not be an issue
[23:06:19] <purplex> make sure the code follows that specific style where braces start from newline, and it will be fine.

[23:07:51] <Tommy> Xplorator .. Ok i prepare some better example !
[23:08:16] <Xplorator> Tommy, statement needs a semicolon, a right brace can end a statement, and the last statement of a block doesn't need a semicolon. Is that right ?
