[02:24:57] <operational> Hello
[02:25:31] <Joanna> :)
[02:28:51] <Roey> hey-hey
[02:30:12] <Joanna> Hi Roey
[02:30:28] <Roey> Joanna: what's your interest in opsec about?
[02:30:41] <Roey> like, do you work in the field?
[02:31:20] <Joanna> I have in interest in opsec and I should also add physical security.
[02:31:37] <Roey> oh cool
[02:32:20] <Joanna> I’m also interested in how building designs affect safety and security
[02:32:24] <Roey> Joanna: do you like the policy-making side or the gruntwork-side of the job more?
[02:33:14] <Joanna> The security thing is an interest my main focus is programming
[02:33:41] <Joanna> Security is definitely important when it comes to programming of course
[02:36:04] <Joanna> I’m very interested in the concept of defensible space.
[02:36:41] <Roey> ahhhh ok
[02:36:46] <Roey> you into python by any chance?
[02:37:09] <Roey> I used it quite a bit for parsing the output of security scanner tools
[02:39:42] <Joanna> Unfortunately not :)
[02:46:27] <Roey> oh hrm okay, which langs then?
[02:46:31] <Roey> now I'm curious!
[02:47:22] <Joanna> Mostly delphi and sql
[02:47:32] <Roey> ah, gotcha.
[02:47:53] <Joanna> I do a lot of oop
[02:47:59] <Roey> do you run any static code analysis tools?
[02:48:01] <Joanna> And gui
[02:48:02] <Roey> aye
[02:48:16] <Roey> oh ok so you probably do have that in mind then
[02:48:43] <Roey> so you're probably familiar with this whole software deveopment/test/deployment process too
[02:49:17] <Joanna> I know about those tools but I’ve never actually used them I tend to just test the software by playing with it to see if it’s slow.
[02:50:35] <Roey> so they do something that I find important, "taint analysis", whereby any chances at user input (edit boxes, say) get traced through all of the functions that touch it, to show you functions  malicious input may trigger
[02:50:44] <Roey> Forte does this
[02:51:06] <Roey> https://dzone.com/articles/what-is-taint-analysis-and-why-should-i-care
[02:51:16] <Joanna> You can also control what is possible to enter into the edit box
[02:51:25] <Joanna> Like not allow certain characters
[02:51:53] <Roey> right, -but- if the text gets intercepted and changed once the user has submitted, then you still need to check on the server if the value is valid
[02:52:30] <Roey> so like, just because the user can;t input those characters doesn't mean that malware  impersonating a user can't either
[02:54:10] <Joanna> You also can use params with your sql of course
[02:54:20] <Roey> aye, yeah
[02:55:20] <Joanna> The current database I am doing is a local sqlite on so it’s not like the users would be hacking a remote database.
[02:55:35] <Roey> aye
[02:55:53] <Roey> well consider how malicious osftware may take advantage of this, though.
[02:56:05] <Roey> to get access to some other component
[02:56:07] <Joanna> Most things that control the sql are selections from comboboxes although I do have a text field for searches
[02:56:12] <Roey> ok
[02:56:23] <Roey> so like,
[02:56:48] <Joanna> The user can get into the sqlite database fairly easy because it’s on their machine
[02:56:48] <Roey> do you run the input against any kind of checker?
[02:56:54] <Roey> ok
[02:57:00] <Joanna> Not at moment
[02:57:05] <Roey> got it
[02:57:07] <Roey> (brb)

[03:33:48] <Joanna> Hi HaMsTeRs :)
[03:34:04] <HaMsTeRs> Good morning Joanna :)
[03:48:04] <Roey> Joanna: oh you're an op here?
[03:48:22] <Hydragyrum> joanna owns this channel
[03:48:33] <Roey> Joanna: are you founder of this channel? I was invited to it a few days ago and really like it
[03:48:36] <Roey> ahhhh ok cool cool
[03:48:41] <Roey> so Joanna is the founder.
[03:48:47] <Roey> Hydragyrum: hi to you too!
[03:49:09] * Hydragyrum waves
[03:49:16] <Roey> :D
[03:54:58] <Joanna> Yes I created this channel when network first launched
[03:55:54] <Joanna> Glad you like it. There are many elements to security
[04:10:40] <Roey> soooooo here's an idea.
[04:11:08] <Roey> I have chatted with some folks,  very security-minded, who don't chat on IRC from their own machines
[04:11:16] <Roey> but from a VPS
[04:11:33] <Roey> have you seen that setup before, Joanna?
[04:11:37] *** Joins: shibboleth (~shibbolet@user/shibboleth)
[04:12:07] <Roey> In addition, they set the address of the VPS, the side that alks to IRC, to a Tor network address
[04:12:23] <Roey> so IRC side never sees the real IP address of the machine.
[04:12:55] <Joanna> Hmm
[04:13:00] <Roey> the idea being that if someone manages to hack my IRC client, they won't be able to reach my machine
[04:13:17] <Roey> I can bring the guy in here
[04:13:18] <Joanna> Not a bad idea
[04:13:24] <Roey> yeah? :)
[04:13:26] <Roey> well
[04:13:36] <Roey> I need to ask him how he actually connects to he irc client
[04:13:50] <Roey> if it's a different virtual machine that he connects to grpahically and just uses IRC from there
[04:13:51] <Roey> or what
[04:14:00] <Roey> or if he has it send data to his home pc
[04:14:02] *** Quits: lind{at}yahoo (uid486956@tinside.irccloud.com) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[04:14:12] <Roey> Joanna: another notion I had.
[04:14:25] <Joanna> The thing I like about irc is you can choose your client or even create your own irc client
[04:14:39] <Roey> sure
[04:15:17] <Roey> but like, I meant to ask if he logs into the machine and uses its virtual desktop GUI remotely, or does he have it bounce IRC traffic to his home box
[04:15:18] <Joanna> I’m vehemently against most “modern” social media and chat platforms
[04:15:23] <Roey> aye
[04:16:01] <Joanna> I did used to use icq but they ruined that pretty much
[04:17:57] <Joanna> It’s a good idea to have a separate machine dedicated to chatting and web surfing that’s separate from the machines with more important stuff on them
[04:21:29] <Roey> yeah
[04:21:33] <Roey> soooooooo
[04:21:38] <Roey> (I'm thinking)
[04:22:04] <Roey> when you say "separate machine" you mean a separate device and not something that you connect to from another device
[04:22:23] <Joanna> I dedicated computer
[04:22:23] <Roey> but yeah I understand
[04:22:26] <Roey> got it
[04:22:34] <Roey> how do you transfer data between it and your home computer?
[04:22:43] <Joanna> Maybe many can’t afford such a luxury though
[04:22:47] <Roey> sure
[04:23:20] <Roey> now, how do you transfer data between it and other computers
[04:23:29] <Roey> let's say you download something
[04:23:30] <Roey> mp3
[04:23:32] <Roey> photo
[04:23:35] <Roey> pdf
[04:23:40] <Joanna> I guess you could email yourself things or use removable media
[04:23:44] <Roey> hmm.
[04:23:52] <Roey> wow you are so hard-core with this.
[04:24:12] <Joanna> I’m a big fan of flash drives
[04:24:21] <Roey> what about wearing out usb connectors tho
[04:24:54] <Joanna> But if your chatting computer gets malware it could end up being transferred
[04:25:21] <Joanna> I own a lot of usb drives I cycle through
[04:25:56] <Joanna> I suppose anything can wear out from being used
[04:36:10] <Roey> aye, of course

[05:19:37] <catbeard> Joanna: btw my bot has a topic formatter and masker
[05:20:04] <catbeard> you set the vars and then the format (structure) of the vars to be inserted, and it updates the topic when you update a var
[05:22:05] <catbeard> just saw your massive topic update bonanza
[05:22:34] <catbeard> also maybe you should use bit.ly links so it will look cleaner and fit in the topic, and at the same time be trackable e.g. visit count
[05:23:30] <catbeard> anyone who knows what they are doing could simply curl -I the bit.ly/link and add a + at the end to get the actual URL it's redirecting to before visiting the original
[05:24:09] <catbeard> could also use goo.gl but you get what i'm saying
