[01:04:11] <edrx> great
[01:05:43] <chrisb> bpalmer: thanks, that makes sense, but in this case, the author of the file let the file be read into the buffer with some default from some auto?-mode-alist and then recommended changing to org-mode

[15:01:36] <Diablo-D3> emacs terminology I guess follows it being its own wm conceptually?
[15:01:48] <ski> yea, it predates the now dominant meaning of "Window" in windowing systems such as X Windows, MS Windows, &c.
[15:02:02] <ski> sounds quite likely
[15:02:10] <Diablo-D3> so frame is an emacs window, window is an emacs pane, and buffer is still a buffer, right?
[15:02:25] <ski> a "Frame" in Emacs terminology would be what would otherwise nowadays usually be called a "Window"
[15:02:56] <Diablo-D3> because I dont want more windows inside of the frame, I juts want one window in the new frame
[15:03:13] <Diablo-D3> and then new buffers created but hidden
[15:03:45] <ski> (but an Emacs using a terminal display can still have multiple "virtual frames", of which you see only one, but can still switch between them. iirc, `emacsclient -new' gets its own frame (and can also create new virtual ones, but can't access ones belonging to other terminal displays))

[15:39:06] <Diablo-D3> and windows literally cant
[15:39:16] <pjb> topographical, sorry.
[15:39:17] <Diablo-D3> its why everyone binds CAMS to it

[15:39:35] <empwilli> CAMS?
[15:39:38] <Diablo-D3> same with osx, they fucked their input layer up identically, so they bind CAMS too
[15:39:39] <rudybot> edgar-rft: it seems that that article could be replaced with "Press WinKey + Pause/Break". I think that works for all versions of Windows as long as you have a full-size keyboard.
[15:39:41] <Diablo-D3> ctrl alt meta shift
[15:39:49] <pjb> That said, it's used to represent castles in amoiries, so its topographic usage may indeed be older than Apple, even if only limited to certain countries.
[15:40:16] <Diablo-D3> theres a story on why steve jobs used that character
[15:40:19] <Diablo-D3> its in the folklore book
[15:40:44] <Diablo-D3> basically, he had ADHD nerd disorder severely without having an actual ADHD diagnosis
[15:41:08] <Diablo-D3> so one day he thought fonts were cool, and now all computers have vector font support instead of bitmaps only
[15:41:19] <Diablo-D3> one day he thought that symbol was cool, so macs use it

[15:41:53] <Diablo-D3> pjb: bam
[15:42:08] <ski> pjb : my impression is that it's been used topographically for some time. but i dunno, perhaps Apple could have precedent
[15:42:11] <Diablo-D3> the folklore book should be required reading for both applefans and applehaters
[15:42:21] <Diablo-D3> for applefans, it makes you stop being a fan
[15:42:29] <Diablo-D3> for applehaters, it makes you understand why fans are in the wrong century
[15:42:55] <Diablo-D3> it also teaches both people how to actually run a tech company early in its existence, where its okay to actually do cool things

[15:44:24] <ski> rudybot: presumably that should be "Pause". you don't send "Pause" and "Break" at the same time. people who say `<RUN/STOP>' (rather than `<STOP>', or, rarely, `<RUN>') in C64 circles annoy me analogously
[15:44:25] <Diablo-D3> bpalmer: a zombie
[15:45:03] <Diablo-D3> ski: hah dude, you know the entire keyboard fandom? Ive seen reproduction keycaps where they have a run/stpp
[15:45:05] <rudybot> ski: Analogously, there are literally infinite ways to construct a theory that produces the same results Newtonian mechanics does, but in a more complex way.
[15:45:30] * Diablo-D3 absolutely fucking <3s classic keycaps, we lost something in the modern ones
[15:46:20] <ski> Diablo-D3 : "stpp" or "stop" ?
[15:46:41] <Diablo-D3> stop
[15:46:44] <Diablo-D3> how the hell did I type stpp
[15:46:51] <bpalmer> the current apple that just came out with an incredibly impressive M1 chip that's the envy of several multibillion dollar rivals, seems to have revitalized its hardware lineup, seems to be steadily taking over the lineup of semi-affordable watches ... all zombie like behavior.
[15:47:00] <Diablo-D3> bpalmer: tbf apple didnt do shit
[15:47:04] <ski> it's fine if the keycap says both "RUN" and "STOP". after all, you have another one saying both "DEL" and "INST", and another one saying both "f1" and "f2", and so on ..
[15:47:17] <Diablo-D3> apple bought a company and then tried very hard to not to kill the golden goose
[15:47:29] <Diablo-D3> and they've been successful in not doing that
[15:47:44] <Diablo-D3> which I do appreciate, but it just means theres a viable target when apple is taken apart again
[15:48:03] <ski> what's annoying is when you're supposed to refer to key events being sent, not to concrete keypresses
[15:48:13] <Diablo-D3> ski: yes/no
[15:48:17] <Diablo-D3> theres two distinct layers in that
[15:48:25] <Diablo-D3> the actual keysym, which should never change
[15:48:28] <bpalmer> What company did they buy for the M1 chip? What company did they buy for the many generations of iphone? What company did they buy for their watches?
[15:48:30] <Diablo-D3> and then what the layout says it should be
[15:48:54] <Diablo-D3> bpalmer: if you mean purely for the soc, the same company
[15:49:05] <Diablo-D3> they're all variants of the same family
[15:49:35] <Diablo-D3> the problem is they're not really keeping up
[15:49:44] <Diablo-D3> they're trying to pull an intel and just making the chip bigger for the sake of bigger

[15:50:50] <Diablo-D3> jim keller is the engineer that lead the team at PA semi that made that chip
[15:51:18] <ski> well, the C64 (and C128, VIC20) don't really have official keysyms, just keycodes, i suppose. which then get mapped to PETSCII
[15:51:20] <Diablo-D3> hes also the engineer that worked at DEC that produced the then-unpublished chip that AMD bought for the K7 days, which lasted them until the wheels came off when K10 came out
[15:51:36] <Unhammer> thanks jbe

[15:52:04] <Diablo-D3> he knows what all future goals of a CPU are: pulling an intel.

[23:18:24] <johnjaye> lampilelo: hence why you should use ls -p to actually verify it is a directory or not

[23:56:58] <bpalmer> They still dispute the disposition of the Kuril Islands (Russian name) / Northern Territory (Japanese name); as Russia has been distracted on its western front, Japan has apparently brought back the dispute
[23:57:08] <Catie> As I understand it the Korean War is still ongoing too, just under cease-fire or something
[23:57:12] <e1f> so they are still at war
[23:57:14] <bpalmer> causing Russia to move some of its navy towards the islands.
[23:57:35] <Catie> Ah, perhaps I'm mistaken
[23:57:35] <bpalmer> e1f: well, did Russia inherit the USSR's wars?
[23:57:47] <bpalmer> I think France and the UK may still be at war, too.
[23:58:17] <grym> bpalmer: japan also brings this up every few years in general; it's more salient now of course
[23:58:40] <Catie> Okay, it looks like there was an armistice agreement that ended the Korean War, but there have been some shennanigans around it so it's not ultra-solid

[23:59:04] <e1f> russia is a different country than the soviet union. if the united states broke up into more than one country, the usa would no longer exist
[23:59:24] <artefact> isn't that a tautology?
[23:59:25] <grym> Catie: armistice yes, formal "no more war" kind of no
[23:59:48] <cvandusen> Well, there would be the states that are united and those that broke off.
