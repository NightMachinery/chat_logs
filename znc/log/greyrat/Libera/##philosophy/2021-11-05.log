[03:10:56] <biys> i think the best part about TMB was her trolling of the SAHM forums
[03:11:29] <biys> it feels like it's pretty low hanging fruit though
[03:11:54] <biys> i decided to re-read some of it
[03:12:18] *** Joins: causative (~halberd@user/causative)
[03:14:50] <biys> i think the narrative i'm going to write is when my mom accidentally killed a kitten with a gliding rocking chair.  i actually remember getting terribly mad at her for it.  i think i even suggested i was going to break her rocking chair as a result of it.  nowo days my sentiments about rocking is it's a complete waste of time.  daughter likes to be rocked though, boy not so much.
[03:15:26] <biys> a friend of mine was said that rocking is the equivalent of worrying
[03:15:30] <biys> they're both pointless
[03:15:41] <biys> s/was/once/
[03:15:41] <ro-bot-o> biys meant to say: a friend of mine once said that rocking is the equivalent of worrying

[03:18:48] <_candle_> I think it is a catch 22 for women no matter what they do, if they stay home they get called a sponge and etc if they work people say those poor kids in child care all day. Any path woman is judged as bad
[03:19:15] <biys> depends where you live, quebec for example i think is like $10 a day child care
[03:19:42] <biys> where as i have to spend ~$1500/month per kid
[03:20:11] <_candle_> If breast feed, "arent they a bit old for that" if bottle feed " gee you know that is not as good for them"
[03:20:19] <_candle_> Very expensive
[03:20:37] <biys> in canada you get 1 year of employment insurance/maternity leave
[03:20:47] <biys> i think it's like 50-70% of your wage.  i can't remember
[03:21:11] <thunder> the wage gap is bs. it doesn't stand up to multivariate analysis
[03:21:11] <biys> actually iirc you acn do longer but the percentage decreases

[03:23:41] <biys> anyways.  in canada you get 1 year maternity leave, my wife breast fead for the full year
[03:23:53] <wasd> the kitten story was a bit extreme
[03:24:22] <biys> you think it is?  this story i'm writing has to be audience appropriate

[03:25:13] <wasd> idk, it happened to you?  I was just imagining what that might be like "mum accidently killed my kitten"..!

[03:40:52] <biys> i come from a long line of no clicking
[03:41:02] <biys> is there any way you can describe what the wrbsite you linked is about?
[03:43:31] <thunder> it's a highly significant historical document. a misandrist polemic which launched the 2nd wave feminist movement and turned it into a political monster
[03:44:12] <biys> i don't wnat this to seem insulting but... do you know how rooch v is ?
[03:44:14] <thunder> if you click the history link, you'll see it's not something they're sweeping under the rug, but are actively still promoting that to the next generations of women and men
[03:44:28] <biys> s/how/who/
[03:44:29] <ro-bot-o> biys meant to say: i don't wnat this to seem insulting but... do you know who rooch v is ?

[03:45:04] <biys> what do you think of the MGTOW movement?
[03:45:37] <biys> do you think the famillial strcutre/system is under attack?
[03:45:46] <thunder> everyone's free to make their own choices as long as they don't advocate violence towards others
[03:45:47] <biys> the "nuclear family" i think the term is
[03:46:16] <thunder> under attack? it's practically a historical relic at this point
[03:46:48] <_candle_> Hmm
[03:47:05] <thunder> how many families do you know who can afford to have mom at home and dad at work?
[03:47:22] <biys> thunder: depends on the lifestyle people are expecting to live
[03:47:26] <thunder> much less stay together in marriage throughout their children's upbringing?
[03:47:27] <biys> and what benefits they want to provide their children
[03:47:28] <biys> IMO
[03:47:37] <wasd> abbreviation searches are helping me here :) 	
[03:47:40] <wasd> Maximum Gross Take-Off Weight
[03:47:51] <biys> MGTOW is men going their own way
[03:47:59] <wasd> Oh, that was in the list too
[03:48:14] <thunder> it's fine to me for people to have a choice in their situation, but as it stands, having a nuclear family is a fast fading luxury
[03:48:20] <thunder> at best
[03:48:27] <biys> luxury?
[03:48:38] <_candle_> I wonder how it got the name nuclear
[03:48:42] <_candle_> Caboom
[03:48:46] <thunder> nucleus
[03:49:01] <wasd> MGTOW... is an anti-feminist, misogynistic, mostly online community advocating for men to separate themselves from women and from a society which they believe has been corrupted by feminism
[03:49:16] <wasd> sounds like a fun party :-o wth?
[03:50:23] <_candle_> In primates do the males hang out together and the females...say in Chimps
[03:50:40] <_candle_> I heard in primates they will savagely kill outsiders
[03:50:45] <biys> thunder: what do you think about women wearing make-up in the work place?
[03:50:50] <biys> or high heals, for example
[03:50:53] <_candle_> And have full on Chimp wars
[03:51:37] <_candle_> Not that we are like Chimps or Bonobos but maybe a little
[03:51:41] <thunder> biys: same thing I think about men wearing makup and high heals in the workplace. dgaf. it's not relatd to my job performance
[03:52:06] <biys> defniitely not the answer i expected.  hah
[03:53:42] <thunder> of course not. most people have been spoonfed the left/right bs for so long they can't pull their heads out of their asses long enough to recognize a simple statement of facts when they see it
[03:55:02] <wasd> "simple statement of facts" sounds a bit like, my truth is the truth.  I guess concrete examples would clarify.
[03:55:13] <thunder> scroll up
[03:55:43] * wasd scrolls...
[03:56:10] <wasd> damn, forgot I was using tmux.
[03:56:19] <biys> thunder: i've read lots of this stuff, watched it too
[03:56:20] * wasd scrolls differently...
[03:56:32] <biys> i don't necessarily agree with any of it or all of it or have any real opinionon the matter
[03:56:40] <biys> i've just seen and know lots of peopel who talk about the stuff
[04:00:25] <_candle_> I had one workplace that had freedress Friday, they in a meeting tried to make a rule no low cut tops..hmm
[04:03:26] <_candle_>  i accidently turned up to work in thongs instead of highheels before
[04:03:57] <_candle_> I think probably most people dont mind what others wear but the ones who you hear about it
[04:06:44] <_candle_> Wonder what percentage of men are into that MGTOW thing and how it wpuld change how they acted
[04:07:37] <_candle_> The manosphere. I few years ago i found that redpill thing on reddit, it was pretty shocking a bit
[04:08:08] <_candle_> Like men saying actually, i know what women want and they actually WANT us yo hurt them
[04:08:10] <thunder> if some guys want to opt-out of the gene pool, that's their choice. people do that for a wide array of reasons, none of which have any discernable impact on me or anyone I know. apart from butthurt from social media anyway.
[04:08:21] <_candle_> Anyway...freak out material
[04:12:08] <_candle_> Yeah everyones choice marry, dont marry up to them
[04:12:40] <_candle_> s/yo/to
[04:12:41] <ro-bot-o> _candle_ meant to say: Yeah evertones choice marry, dont marry up to them
[04:12:56] <_candle_> Haha
[04:13:04] <_candle_> Wrong correction
[04:13:26] <_candle_> I think they removed a lot of those worst groups a few years ago
[04:15:51] <wasd> nowt stranger than folk.  seem like a right bunch of weirdos.
[04:19:58] <_candle_> Make it look like it was wide spread opinion as they seem to all upvote and comment to agree but maybe just was a echo chamber abd reasonable thinking ones didnt go on there
[04:22:59] <thunder> something to be aware of is the algorithmic and direct manipulation of public opinion via social media platforms, often for clandestine political purposes. it's endemic, and not unique to any one ideology, but instead, who has the most money to spend and an expected roi from doing so.
[04:25:17] <thunder> you need only look at things like tv evangelism and the Qanon movement for only 2 examples of how gullible and susceptible to group-think people can be with the right nudges

[04:27:38] <wasd> I'm not convinced they need or necessarily get nudges.  Some percent of the population seem to need to seek out a collective belief system based on blind faith.
[04:28:01] <thunder> one of my favorite examples is trinidad, where analysts noticed that while the prevailing government had always been of african descent due to their relative majority, the asian community would always entirely vote as a unanimous block. so on behalf of the asian candidate, the market strategists started a leftist grass roots "decline the vote" campaign among african voters, the consequence of which was the asian candidate winning the election.

[04:29:48] <wasd> What's "leftist" about "decline the vote"?
[04:30:00] <wasd> that word seems oddly inserted :D
[04:30:08] <thunder> the perceived schism in the political spectrum which the strategists took advantage of
[04:31:50] <thunder> if the african voters had be right wing oriented, they'd probably have framed it in those terms instead. albeit with some ideological window dressing to make it line up to public expectations
[04:32:22] <wasd> Guess they never heard of the chartists.

He knew because of the last line "dont have long left", I would think he was sick and dying and so talk to him, but he wasnt, nothing was wrong with him, then he just said all that meant was he was mid 30s and felt like half his life is gone so he doesn't have long left.
[04:55:26] <_candle_> To me that is a strange way to say it. I think probably he knew I woukdnt talk to him without a big lever of aome kind.
[04:56:07] <_candle_> Anyway, mind games.
[04:56:10] <thunder> this is from nytimes, so take it as you will, but according to the article " a poll ...by the Public Religion Research Institute and the Interfaith Youth Core, which found that 15 percent of Americans say they think that the levers of power are controlled by a cabal of Satan-worshiping pedophiles" https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/27/us/politics/qanon-republicans-trump.html

[22:44:45] <probableUser_> hello Philosophers! Do you think "social sciences" are real sciences?
[22:44:48] <tomathy> hey i think i can prove mind/body dualism
[22:44:58] <tomathy> probableUser_: no, but neither is biology
[22:45:22] <probableUser_> why that?
[22:45:36] <tomathy> it's a catalogue of observations, there's no theory or law
[22:45:56] <tomathy> this is just my opinion
[22:45:56] <probableUser_> but it's reducible to physics/chemistry
[22:46:09] <tomathy> and they are the only real sciences
[22:46:09] <probableUser_> at least a big deal of it
[22:46:35] <probableUser_> well, thats the question :) what about classical conditioning? is this not a "law"?
[22:46:53] <tomathy> what's that i never heard of it
[22:47:07] <probableUser_> Pawlows Dog.
[22:47:22] <tomathy> oh, the idea of learning by association
[22:47:29] <probableUser_> yes
[22:47:41] <tomathy> that's a description of how neurons behave
[22:47:43] <probableUser_> the concatination of a stimulus and a reaction
[22:48:04] <probableUser_> on a meta-level to neurons
[22:48:13] <tomathy> yeh well it's fine to find out things like this
[22:48:25] <tomathy> but i find the lowest form of human uses them in their life, and it is unethical to use them

[22:48:38] <tomathy> i've seen people try to use conditioning on me, and i want to cut them
[22:49:03] <tomathy> fine, it's a science, but it's a dark science if it's applied - that means it has morals attached to it, so it can't be a true science
[22:49:04] <probableUser_> lets not get personal oder ethical here
[22:49:24] <probableUser_> or*
[22:49:49] <probableUser_> why is not physics simply a form of "how neurons react"?
[22:50:21] <tomathy> idk
[22:50:43] <tomathy> are you interested in my proof of mind/body dualism
[22:50:49] <probableUser_> show me
[22:50:49] <tomathy> i want to hear if someone else has thought of it
[22:50:58] <probableUser_> i am pretty sure it will be wrong :D
[22:51:06] <probableUser_> i am a physicalist :)
[22:51:22] <probableUser_> or materialist, or whatever

[22:52:03] <tomathy> basically, the abstraction of an algorithm is distinct from its implementation, because the implementation depends on the workings of the machine. the fact that a mind like ours can control a robot, and even a dog, it proves the mind exists.
[22:52:16] *** Joins: flynn0 (~mcbloch@user/flynn)
[22:52:23] <tomathy> i claim that the abstraction of algorithms is the exact same thing as a mind
[22:52:32] <tomathy> and the implementation is the body
[22:52:38] <probableUser_> thats basically the point of John Searle
[22:53:10] <tomathy> nice ill search for him
[22:53:15] *** Joins: chiselfuse (~chiselfus@user/chiselfuse)
[22:53:20] <darklambda> algo abstraction = psuedo code?
[22:53:26] <probableUser_> the problem with that is, that neither dogs nor machines can "percieve" the algorithm.
[22:53:26] *** Quits: flynn (~mcbloch@user/flynn) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[22:53:26] *** flynn0 is now known as flynn
[22:54:04] <probableUser_> Algorithms don't exist. Its a description of how things behave
[22:54:12] <probableUser_> Not the cause of their behaving
[22:54:26] <tomathy> darklambda basically yes
[22:54:43] <probableUser_> what you mean by that @darklambda
[22:55:13] <tomathy> algorithms exist as much as anything exists
[22:55:34] <darklambda> isn't algo just a recipe of doing things? and such  recipes exist... people replicate cakes out of it.. hehe
[22:55:42] <probableUser_> when would you say that n+n+n+n+1-2+5+n+n+n-3 exists?
[22:56:10] <probableUser_> this is an algorithm ... but no one cares about and probably no one ever used it
[22:56:22] <darklambda> that seems to be an expression.. not an algo, right?
[22:57:07] <tomathy> 7n + 1 is just an elevated line
[22:57:14] <tomathy> it is all over the place
[22:57:15] <probableUser_> well... you can set a condition to make it an algo. lets say add "n" till n>20
[22:57:33] <tomathy> does an algorithm depend on arrangement?
[22:57:47] <probableUser_> i think so
[22:57:59] <tomathy> because you have not mentioned any pauses, that isn't really an algorithm
[22:58:02] <probableUser_> does a recipe depend on the meal?
[22:58:34] <tomathy> yeh an expression isn't an algo
[22:58:41] <probableUser_> why would an algorithm need pauses if its "mental" or "non-physical"?

[23:00:06] <tomathy> go to bathroom, use toilet
[23:00:16] <tomathy> vs use toilet, go to bathroom
[23:00:17] <tomathy> lol
[23:00:29] *** Joins: ravan (~ravan@user/ravan)
[23:00:58] <tomathy> but we're basically debating now if algorithms exist right?
[23:01:03] <darklambda> one definition from quick google search: A finite set of unambiguous instructions that, given some set of initial conditions, can be performed in a prescribed sequence to achieve a certain goal and that has a recognizable set of end conditions.
[23:01:33] <probableUser_> yeah, basically what i sad - add "n" till n > 20
[23:02:11] <darklambda> what's the initial condition?
[23:02:22] <probableUser_> but "adding something" is non existent.
[23:02:34] <probableUser_> n = 0 or 1 or what ever you want it to be
[23:03:01] <probableUser_> the relation "is greater than" is non existent
[23:03:33] <probableUser_> those are "words"
[23:04:30] <probableUser_> or concepts. There are in so far "real" because they refer to processes, changes, actions, etc. in the world
[23:04:31] <darklambda> if you're saying that number is abstract in a way that it could be 1 cow or 1 carabao.. it's abtract...   could represent nonexistent stuff also like the 1 whammi whammi
[23:04:52] <probableUser_> but abstraction is not existent
[23:05:07] <probableUser_> there is no abstract ontology
[23:05:14] <probableUser_> except ofcourse language
[23:05:25] <darklambda> that thingy that it represents could exist or not exist
[23:05:37] <probableUser_> but language is reducible to behaviour according to Wittgenstein
[23:06:06] <probableUser_> abstraction represents nothing. Its the most universal category - its empty
[23:06:37] <probableUser_> as you said - it could cow or carabo. But without the cow or carabao, there is no "1" either
[23:06:46] <thunder> the most self-evident form of symbolism is behaviour, such as demonstrating a process

[23:07:02] <probableUser_> yes
[23:07:10] <thunder> that's why animals make great symbols, because one can observe their behaviour in order to illucidate the context
[23:08:27] <thunder> notwithstanding layers of meaning embodied in cultural relationship
[23:08:30] <probableUser_> nothing to say about that
[23:10:48] <probableUser_> but the connection between the various individual meanings is not something inherently to the meaning itself, but the lifefrom of the individuals, which by nature share the same
[23:11:15] <probableUser_> abilities and skills to use and encrypt those meanings
[23:11:42] <thunder> indeed
[23:12:49] <thunder> the other part I feel is that the formation of ideas and meaning is ultimately a guide towards the nature of action/relationship, so effectively meaning translates into behaviour

[23:13:20] <thunder> what we choose
[23:13:27] <probableUser_> i agree, thats pragmatism
[23:14:04] <probableUser_> and i can't see a way around that
[23:14:44] <probableUser_> that should be the metaphysical point of departure
[23:15:03] <probableUser_> not an allready pre-ordered algorithm
[23:15:10] <probableUser_> or pre-organised
[23:18:00] <thunder> the way I view it other and self are different kinds of perception like observed and observer, outside-in vs inside-out. I feel that difference is intrinsic to being conscious.
[23:22:14] <probableUser_> i think there is no difference. the only difference exists in langauge - in the "i" and "you"
