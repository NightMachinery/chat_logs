[00:44:26] <maroon> i see in wikipedia that a euler pseudoprime would be like p=2q+1, 2^(p-1)mod p == 1, and 2^qmod p == 1 also. ie 2^2046mod2047==1 and 2^1023mod2047 also 1. my question is if there's such a thing where a composite returns 1 for both 2^(p-1)modp and for 2^(q-1)modq

[01:50:13] <Knix3_> Okay so I've seen on numerous occasions people taking a state of some system, say the monitors being used on a computer, and reduced the information to just one number by giving each item of the system an id (based on the 2^(the ordinal number - 1)) and adding the ids together
[01:50:43] <Knix3_> say you have three monitors and are using the first two, the state of the system is 3 because 2^0 + 2^1 = 3
[01:51:10] <Knix3_> if you're using the first and third, the state is 2^0 + 2^2 = 5
[01:51:49] <Knix3_> so in this scenario if I see 5, I can quickly figure out that the original numbers were 1 and 3
[01:51:54] <pounce> kinda weirded out about John Lee's Riemannian Manifolds book Ex 2.7: prove that φ is a local isometry iff φ*g = g̃ (i.e. φ is a global isometry)

[01:58:46] <pounce> Knix3_: writing the digits?
[01:59:00] <isekaijin> Wait, something doesn't seem right. There are local isometries that are not global isometries, for the very simple reason that they are not diffeomorphisms to begin with.
[01:59:18] <Knix3_> pounce what do you mean?
[01:59:36] <pounce> isekaijin: it's given that φ is a diffeomorphism, appologies I thought that was implied by the pullback
[01:59:46] <isekaijin> pounce: No, it is not implied.
[01:59:51] <isekaijin> You can pull back along any smooth map.
[02:00:03] <pounce> ahh yeah sorry
[02:00:21] <pounce> Knix3_: e.g. in this case 5 = 101₂
[02:01:14] <Knix3_> I don't understand where you got that
[02:01:22] <isekaijin> Also, “f : X -> Y is a local isometry iff the pullback f^* : \Omega(Y) -> \Omega(X) sends Y's metric to X's metric” doesn't require proof, because it's literally the definition.
[02:02:01] <pounce> that's what im saying ya
[02:02:07] <isekaijin> (Well, f has to be a local diffeomorphism, but let's nott sweat the small details.)
[02:02:12] <isekaijin> not*
[02:02:46] <pounce> although the definition here is "f is a local isometry if each point has a neighborhood U such that f|U is a (global) isometry"
[02:03:21] <Knix3_> I'm assuming you mean 101 is 5 in binary but how do you go from 101 to 2 and 3
[02:03:34] <isekaijin> It's the same thing, because forms are defined locally anyway.
[02:03:39] <pounce> isekaijin: yeah
[02:03:57] <isekaijin> But I guess now I see the point to the exercise.
[02:04:01] <pounce> Knix3_: because the 1st digit is a 1 and the third digit is a 1

[03:34:35] <PlanckWalk> Or maybe with the same variables but explicit quantification of them
[03:35:45] <PlanckWalk> E.g. in the expression {(x,y,t) : (x-t)^2 + (y+t)^2 <= t^2} on the RHS of the first equality, it's not at all clear that x and y are bound by t is free.

[04:55:02] <Ethos> There is some simple argument i am missing here: if a_n = (1+1/n)^n and b_n = (1+1/n)^(n+1) then a_n is increasing and b_n is decreasing. Furthermore, b_n is bounded below hence convergent.
[04:55:56] <Ethos> But then: a_n = b_n * (1+1/n)^(-1) = b_n* n/(n+1) and hence a_n is convergent

[04:56:15] <Ethos> Why a_n is convergent?
[04:56:16] <frelleck> if a_n is increasing so is b_n
[04:56:23] <frelleck> since it increases faster
[04:57:26] <Ethos> They can't conclude a_n is convergent with b_n is convergent and n/(n+1) is also convergent (so the product is convergent), so i guess i am missing something
[04:57:48] <Ethos> is there a bound above i am missing?

[05:00:10] <greenbagels> well you could prove it by hand if you want
[05:00:14] <JimmyRustles> so couldn't you just set m really high, calculate 1 digit of pi, then convert it to base 10 and have trillions of digits of pi?
[05:00:28] <Ethos> I am trying to catch their argument :P
[05:00:31] <JimmyRustles> wait i think i misunderstood how it works
[05:00:44] <JimmyRustles> having one digit in a high base won't necessarily give you more digits in a lower base, right?

[17:45:49] <dila> Z-module: thanks, but because there is a bijection f() its possible to write f(ab) = f(a)f(b) where i think products in (F_p)^n are convolutions of vectors
[17:45:57] <euouae> I'm wondering if there's a concept where this is generalized to infinity? We have objects indexed by n, and each includes the previous?
[17:46:22] <euouae> classes of objects*
[17:47:31] <dila> euouae: subsets? A contained in B contained in C
[17:48:00] <riv> euouae: yes this is done in type theory, where you have an infinite sequence of types - each containing the previous

[18:35:58] <isekaijin> In fact, given any ring A, and any polynomial equation f(x) \in A[x], you can freely adjoin a solution to that equation, i.e., construct the ring A[x] / <f(x)>.

[20:53:54] <Simplar> Dude, what
[20:54:21] <isekaijin> We are not required to feed you information in the exact format that Wolfram Alpha understands.
[20:54:22] <Z-module> cadmio: it's not simple (A_5 is a nontrivial proper normal subgroup), but it's not solvable because A_5 is simple.
[20:54:49] <Z-module> you probably just meant to say you already proved A_5 is simple
[20:54:59] <Simplar> isekaijin: well, just wanted to know *if* that's even possible
[20:54:59] <cadmio> sorry not solvable
[20:55:08] <Simplar> aka whether my search is futile or not
[20:55:14] <isekaijin> Simplar: As dila said, just convert to base 5.
[20:55:33] <isekaijin> Simplar: Actually, strictly speaking, you could just say that 1 + 1 + 1 + ... (2022 times) = 2202 is a sum of powers of 5.
[20:55:41] <isekaijin> But that is probably not what you want.
[20:56:22] <Simplar> True. I want the lowest possible amount of power of 5 natural terms for that.
[20:57:00] <Simplar> Base 5 it's 31042
[20:57:23] <dila> did you want a binary number in base 5?
[20:59:03] <Z-module> cadmio, looks good
[20:59:14] <Z-module> (I see you quoted me in the 1st solution...that's fine)
[20:59:29] <Simplar> dila: My original question was whether 2022 is representable as sum of natural numbers, each to the power of 5, or not, and what is the lowest amount of these numbers to sum up.
[20:59:37] <cadmio> :)
[21:00:02] <cadmio> but in the 2nd I've not yet proved that an abelian simple group is prime cyclic

[21:07:00] <Z-module> cadmio:   So if A is abelian simple, it must be finite (since it has lots of proper subgroups that are all normal), so |A| = n for some n > 1.  Pick any single g in A other than e.  So g has some order k <= n.  If k < n, then  {g, g^2, ..., g^k = e}  is a proper nontrivial subgroup of A, and it's normal, violating A's simplicity. So in fact k = n, so A = <g> is cyclic. But if n has a factor j with 1 < j < n, then <g^n> is a proper
[21:07:00] <Z-module> nontrivial subgroup.  Thus no such j exists, so n is prime.
[21:07:19] <riv> cadmio: cyclic group of size a*b, e.g. C_15 = C_3 x C_5

[23:02:12] <ProfSimm> I suppose to represent a hypergraph as a graph, we have virtual intermediary connecting nodes that act as "hubs"
[23:02:53] <mycroftiv> euoae: it sounds like your approach makes sense, just dont be surprised when what the computerized type theoretic programming does in practice seems different from what youve read. type universes as similar to grothendieck universes is true though :)
[23:03:32] <euouae> mycroftiv thanks for the reassurance. It gets sorta deep when I'm reading about locally closed cartesian categories :P
[23:03:51] <euouae> so I second guess myself "is this the right path?"
[23:04:55] <euouae> ProfSimm I'm not sure if you can represent a hypergraph as a graph. What's the complete hypergraph on two nodes?
[23:04:55] <mycroftiv> euoae: the writing about types is often insanely dense notation and a lot of talk of simplicial set models via presheaves and categories with families and locally closed cartesian and PI-W pretoposes and univalence axioms and it can be utterly baffling to get your bearings i agree
[23:06:27] <ProfSimm> euouae: I can't think of a way it won't work

[23:07:01] <ProfSimm> euouae: I don't understand the question.
[23:07:39] <ProfSimm> euouae: but naively I just connect them directly without a hub, as I don't need a hub

[23:08:27] <euouae> ProfSimm the complete hypergraph on two nodes v0, v1 has as edge set the powerset of {v0, v1}
[23:09:03] <euouae> which you can represent in a graph actually -- I guess I meant to ask you, how do you represent the complete hypergraph of 3 nodes...
[23:09:50] *** Joins: justsomeguy (~justsomeg@user/justsomeguy)
[23:10:17] <ProfSimm> euouae: I introduce a "hub node" and connect the 3 nodes to it. Now when I traverse node to node, I need to skip past each hub as if I don't "count" it, but use it as a connecting point
[23:10:45] <ProfSimm> euouae: basically like ethernet hub
[23:10:46] <euouae> ah ok so you are encoding hypergraphs using graphs and extra information. yeah
[23:10:52] <ProfSimm> Yeah
[23:11:04] <ProfSimm> It needs extra nodes for each "space" of nodes
[23:11:10] <ProfSimm> One hub node per space
[23:11:32] <euouae> a bipartite graph is enough to encode a hypergraph

[23:11:59] <euouae> given a hypergraph (V, E) you can take a bipartite graph with columns V and E and connect v to e iff v is in e

[23:13:24] <euouae> yes
[23:13:27] <ProfSimm> Cool.
[23:13:29] <ProfSimm> Thanks
[23:13:36] <euouae> you're welcome
[23:13:52] <euouae> this is just one representation. others may fit your purpose better
[23:14:12] <ProfSimm> Well I'm mostly trying to enable traversal/queries and avoid edge explosion
[23:15:19] <euouae> a hypergraph on n nodes can have 2^n edges and with the graph we talked about you're looking at a maximum of 2^(2^n) edges
[23:15:48] <euouae> that sounds kinda explosive
[23:16:28] <ProfSimm> The bipartite graph encoding shouldn't be like this.

[23:17:39] <ProfSimm> euouae: say 20 links are connected, that'll be 20 edges to the hub node.
[23:17:49] <ProfSimm> nodes not links
[23:18:00] <ProfSimm> Of course 20 nodes to 20 spaces is 400 edges
[23:18:11] <euouae> What I'm saying is that a hyperedge e has |e| edges in the bipartite graph
[23:18:13] <ProfSimm> But can this be avoided at all
[23:18:38] <euouae> so you're looking at -maximum- the sum |e| over all subsets e of {1,2,...,n}.
[23:19:06] <ProfSimm> This is a bit like a cluster finding algorithm. If I can find clusters with similar connectivity I can connect clusters, and not individual nodes

[23:20:26] <ProfSimm> euouae: is there a more efficient approach
[23:20:34] <euouae> try that and see if it works for you
