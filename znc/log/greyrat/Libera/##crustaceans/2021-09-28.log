[00:01:41] <gwozniak> ugh :(
[00:01:46] <gwozniak> sorry to hear that
[00:04:04] <manicennui> I am allergic to effort.
[00:04:40] <manicennui> I'm pretty excited because there is a new bakery opening up the street from me that claims to have great bagels.
[00:04:45] <manicennui> They also have sourdough.

[00:06:22] <prussian> speaking of lobste.rs, the number one issue I see with libcurl, or at least seen professionally in nonfree codebases at works
[00:07:00] <prussian> https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_COPYPOSTFIELDS.html people don't use this, pass a c_str() created ref and the std::string object gets destructed and curl has a dangling ref.

[00:08:37] <prussian> gwozniak: ty. it is ok.
[00:08:54] <prussian> manicennui: a sourdough bagel? damn.

[01:18:29] <dimadima> manicennui: what neighborhood do you live in that you have all this stuff around you
[01:18:37] <dimadima> so many places in chicago are barren
[01:18:59] <dimadima> i stayed with some friends in logan square a while back and it was a wasteland
[01:22:05] <dimadima> i remember walking down fullerton for what seemed like miles looking for a produce store and only encountering liquor stores and dive bars
[01:25:28] *** Joins: mcint (mcint@user/mcint)
[01:29:53] <manicennui> dimadima: Which parts of Chicago are you referring to?
[01:30:09] <manicennui> Probably depends on where you are in Logan Square. Parts of it are amazing.
[01:30:12] <manicennui> I'm in Ravenswood.
[01:30:35] <manicennui> And how long ago were you in Logan's Square? It has seen a huge amount of gentrification.
[01:30:51] <manicennui> You also might not find them all one one street.
[01:31:48] <manicennui> Like I can't think of where a produce store is on my street (there is a grocery store chain half a mile south), but I know where multiple produce stores are if you turn onto another street.
[01:33:48] *** Quits: indigo (~indigo@user/indigo) (Remote host closed the connection)
[01:33:59] <manicennui> I have to imagine that you were in Logan's Square years ago.
[01:34:17] <manicennui> The gentrification is well beyond that area now.
[01:34:33] <manicennui> It's also possible that Fullerton is just a dead spot.

[01:35:13] <dimadima> this was probably like 5 years ago? looking through my address book my friends were at 2234 N Campbell Ave, and the stretch along Western over there was really nice
[01:35:18] *** Joins: hoistbypetard (hoistbypet@user/hoistbypetard)
[01:35:20] <dimadima> but walking west on fullerton it was just dead
[01:35:32] <dimadima> i rememeber there was one organic store, i shouldn't discount that
[01:35:39] <manicennui> Looks like there is a ton of stuff where Fullerton his Milwaukee.
[01:36:20] *** Joins: indigo (~indigo@user/indigo)
[01:36:21] <dimadima> yeah i was walking west of milwuakee
[01:36:27] <dimadima> probably went in the wrong direction
[01:36:45] <dimadima> ravenswood is another neighborhood i always wanted to go to but never checked out
[01:36:50] <dimadima> love the name
[01:37:01] <gerikson> JFC I actually tried to author some gemtext and it's even worse than I anticipated
[01:37:13] <manicennui> There appears to be a produce market about a block away on Western.
[01:37:39] <manicennui> dimadima: Lincoln Square right at the Western brown line stop is a more common area to visit near me.
[01:37:41] <gerikson> like, when writing prose I generally justify paras using the editor (wrap lines ~80 chars)
[01:37:57] <gerikson> a \n is treated literally in gemtext
[01:38:11] <manicennui> dimadima: These days you just open Google Maps and you can see everything.
[01:38:27] <gerikson> so if you wrap at 80, and the client decides to have narrower text, it looks fucking awful
[01:38:33] <dimadima> manicennui: yes that one on western is excellent. but for some reason i didn't go there and walked on fullerton
[01:39:37] * dimadima googles https://www.google.com/search?q=gemtext+programming
[01:39:38] <buttsbot> gemtext programming - Google Search
[01:39:52] <manicennui> The other thing to know about Chicago is that things tend to build up around the train stations.
[01:40:04] <dimadima> manicennui: didn't mean to incinuate there isn't stuff in chicago; just that sometimes it seems patchy
[01:40:05] <gerikson> like wtf https://www.dropbox.com/s/09q5d3vqoa3xkvh/Screen%20Shot%202021-09-28%20at%2000.09.32.png?dl=0

[01:40:24] <manicennui> dimadima: No, I just don't think you can expect to walk in any direction and find what you want.
[01:40:43] <gerikson> so now I have to deal with one giant fucking line of text just because the parser can't be arsed to reflow
[01:40:45] <manicennui> There is a French bakery just north of me, and the new bakery I mentioned will be north of that.
[01:40:53] <manicennui> But I don't know where the nearest bakery is south of me.
[01:41:03] <dimadima> gerikson: oh gemtext is gemini html?
[01:41:17] <gerikson> lol if only it was html
[01:41:20] <gerikson> it's markup
[01:41:26] <gerikson> well, mark...level
[01:41:48] <gerikson> check out what this tool does to markdown: https://sr.ht/~kota/gemgen/
[01:41:49] <buttsbot> gemgen: A Markdown to Gemtext generator.
[01:42:21] <gerikson> it has examples
[01:42:25] <dimadima> manicennui: well it's cool they're opening this bagel place!
[01:42:29] <dimadima> gerikson: thank you
[01:43:12] <manicennui> If you want really dense areas of all kinds of stores there are more specific areas.
[01:43:24] <manicennui> But generally things are sprinkled around in the residential areas.
[01:43:41] <manicennui> I'd recommend North and Damen.
[01:43:51] <manicennui> Or even the Western brown line stop (Lincoln Square).
[01:43:53] <dimadima> flash fucking tago
[01:43:54] <dimadima> taco
[01:44:08] <manicennui> Or one of the specific areas for different ethnic groups.
[01:44:09] <dimadima> remember me to flash taco
[01:44:33] <dimadima> if there's once place i don't need to go to in chicaog, it's north and damen
[01:44:54] <manicennui> heh
[01:45:07] <dimadima> sorry north and halsted
[01:45:07] <manicennui> Some of the best shit in the city is there though.
[01:45:10] <manicennui> Like Quimby's.
[01:45:38] <dimadima> no wait north and damen, i was right
[01:46:16] <dimadima> for sure i just want to go to new places like albany park, lincon square (never been there!), ravenswood
[01:46:38] <manicennui> I love Quimby's and Piece, which are both near North and Damen.
[01:46:40] <dimadima> gerikson: so you're trying gemini authoring?
[01:46:46] <dimadima> piece is good
[01:46:49] <dimadima> you mean the pizza place?
[01:46:50] <manicennui> Too many drunk people for you?
[01:46:51] <manicennui> Yes.
[01:46:59] <manicennui> New Haven style pizza and brewpub.
[01:47:16] <dimadima> no just many friends lived there and spent a lot of time there. want to check out other places
[01:47:30] <manicennui> Ah.
[01:47:57] <manicennui> I don't think you'd enjoy Albany Park unless you had a specific destination or went with a local.
[01:48:00] <manicennui> Much of it is just residential.
[01:48:09] <dimadima> i'm drawn to more family style neighborhoods
[01:48:20] <dimadima> i lived in astoria in new york before it realllly started getting gentrified and it was excellent
[01:48:27] <dimadima> just lots of families of various kinds
[01:48:35] <manicennui> Frankly the Middle Eastern area on Kedzie is the only reason I'd really recommend making an effort to go there.
[01:48:50] <dimadima> that sounds cool
[01:50:37] <manicennui> There is a great divish bar in Albany Park called Nighthawk.
[01:50:43] <manicennui> Looks like it might be a bit different now though.
[01:51:50] <manicennui> Looks like they got rid of the coffee service in the morning, but they still have coffee on the menu.
[01:52:13] <manicennui> I used to go in there before work and sit at the bar and talk to the employees.
[01:52:20] <dimadima> bars with daytime coffee are nice
[01:52:20] <dimadima> woodlawn tap is like that in hyde park
[01:52:27] <manicennui> And they had interesting events like Bob Ross painting nights.
[01:53:03] <manicennui> Most of the people who worked there were in the arts, which made them far more interesting to me.
[01:53:54] <skyl4rk> there are bars without coffee?
[01:54:04] <bkero> Yeah, it's unfortunate.
[01:54:21] <bkero> Establishments that are coffee shops in the day and bars in the evening are not as common in the US as they are in Europe.
[01:54:24] <manicennui> skyl4rk: This place actually opened at like 6 AM and served only coffee until noon or something.
[01:54:34] <manicennui> As well as pastries.
[01:54:54] <manicennui> Stupid Europeans doing everything better...
[01:56:01] <skyl4rk> no I mean not like cafe's, but most places would have a drip pot of burnt swill at least?
[01:56:08] <skyl4rk> s/'//
[01:56:11] <manicennui> I don't think that is uncommon.
[01:56:24] <manicennui> I think most bars will sell you a cup of coffee.
[01:56:46] <manicennui> But it was more about the place being open at 6 AM or whatever, and they had breakfast pastries and an espresso machine.
[01:57:52] <gerikson> dimadima: I set up a server, and I translated my "why I think gemini sucks" blog post to it
[01:58:11] <gerikson> that's when I discovered this "feature"
[01:58:16] <dimadima> hahahaha
[01:58:22] <dimadima> i really need to get a browser
[01:58:30] <dimadima> now you have more material it looks like
[01:58:39] <gerikson> if you're on console, I use amfora
[01:58:41] <gerikson> works ok
[01:59:20] <dimadima> yeah i have amfora github tab open somewhere. i'll get it soon
[01:59:27] <dimadima> you'll be running your server?
[01:59:40] <dimadima> im definitely going to join the gemini revolution even if it sucks
[02:00:52] <dimadima> manicennui: skyl4rk: i assume places w/ free coffee swill do it as a convenience to wasted patrons who need help sobering up
[02:00:58] <dimadima> or vomiting
[02:01:13] <manicennui> dimadima: We just drink until we throw up in Chicago.
[02:01:15] <skyl4rk> never expected free
[02:01:36] <skyl4rk> gemini fails my "can I use it for my photo blog" test
[02:01:38] <dimadima> i've only seen it free
[02:01:46] <dimadima> does it support images?
[02:01:50] <manicennui> I know people who know multiple bars with later closing times so they can continue after 2 AM.
[02:04:37] <dimadima> it's not so uncommon to be open past 4 in chicago
[02:04:45] <dimadima> at least in "happening" places
[02:05:02] <manicennui> I puked all over the urinals at the bar that is just down the street from me now.
[02:05:07] <manicennui> Years ago.
[02:05:15] <manicennui> I didn't go there for several years after.
[02:05:31] <manicennui> They went out of business during the pandemic.
[02:06:59] <dimadima> puking in or near a urinal is pretty civilized
[02:07:07] <dimadima> you could have done much worse
[02:07:45] <manicennui> I tried to go into the toilet, but I was so drunk that I didn't realize which way the stall door went.
[02:07:50] <manicennui> And I couldn't wait any longer.
[02:08:32] <dimadima> with vomit it's A for effort
[02:08:35] <manicennui> I was drinking this beer: https://www.allagash.com/beer/curieux/?ao_confirm (10.2% ABV) and we were doing shots of maple whiskey.
[02:08:36] <buttsbot> Curieux - Allagash Brewing Company
[02:11:59] <dimadima> sounds like a recipe for disaster
[02:12:11] <manicennui> Shots always are.
[02:12:18] <manicennui> There is never a reason to do shots.
[02:13:06] <skyl4rk> wanting to get drunk?
[02:13:50] <dimadima> one thing americans don't know about is russian-style drinking
[02:13:56] <skyl4rk> I've had (whisky|oak)? barrel (aged|stored|flavored) beer once, not a fan.
[02:14:05] <dimadima> which is a cycle of taking shots and making toasts
[02:15:15] <skyl4rk> heated bread or speaking favourly kind of toasts?
[02:15:28] <skyl4rk> or just the synchronization
[02:16:48] <dimadima> its just an excellent way to get consume alcohol and chill with people
[02:17:02] <dimadima> don't know waht you mean about heated bread though
[02:17:42] <skyl4rk> the kind that pops out of a toaster, temporally correlated with putting somewhat colder bread in some time before
[02:18:30] <skyl4rk> I was musing on which interpretation of 'toast' was intended
[02:19:12] <manicennui> Charcuterie, bread, and alcohol is great.
[02:19:54] <dimadima> skyl4rk: oh hahaha sorry i'm totally dense
[02:20:07] <dimadima> i'm not a good person to drink with :)
[02:20:48] <skyl4rk> I'm not very generous with punctuation today which probably makes my sentences harder to parse
[02:21:04] <skyl4rk> I'll stick to that story for now at least
[02:22:08] <dimadima> that's very kind of you
[02:31:00] <manicennui> Charcuterie and liver are why I could never fully give up meat.
[02:31:24] <manicennui> I could deal with no burgers and hot dogs.
[02:35:29] <indigo> dimadima: Also, rye bread chaser
[02:37:26] <indigo> And pickle chaser

[03:58:10] <dimadima> indigo: yes how could i omit the chasing it's a critical part of the equation
[03:59:24] <dimadima> manicennui: liver and smoked meats are, i also think, the best of meats
[03:59:48] <dimadima> manicennui: flash taco is really hit or miss, and that possibly depends on how drunk you are
[04:00:30] <dimadima> chicago has excellent mexican food. like, anywhere you go in chicago i found good to great mexican. not so with new york
[04:03:14] <manicennui> I wonder what kind of food is generally better in NYC.
[04:03:25] <dimadima> i wonder that too, sometimes
[04:03:52] <dimadima> diners in chicago are very good. new york doesn't have hash browns for example
[04:04:40] <ngoldbaum> pizza
[04:04:42] <dimadima> i only found one place in the city that served hash browns. as a rule it's "home fries" which almost awalys are really bad
[04:04:42] <ngoldbaum> c’mon
[04:04:45] <dimadima> ngoldbaum: yes, that's it
[04:04:47] <dimadima> pizza.
[04:04:51] <dimadima> my bad
[04:05:52] <ngoldbaum> new york has more varied options for all kinds of ethnic cuisines
[04:05:55] <dimadima> there's the dollar slice, for example, which some people dislike but i think is excellent https://goo.gl/maps/X4tpCwMcvXaG4GEv6
[04:05:56] <buttsbot> Google Maps
[04:06:12] <ngoldbaum> not saying chicago doesn’t have that but new york easily beats chicago and many other cities
[04:06:26] <dimadima> yeah the variety
[04:08:46] <manicennui> Nah, Chicago has great pizza.
[04:08:54] <manicennui> It's just not the pizza people association with Chicago.
[04:09:34] <manicennui> I haven't eaten deep dish for years.
[04:09:51] <manicennui> And there are, without exaggeration, dozens of pizza places that deliver to me.
[04:10:49] <manicennui> Over 100 right now on Grubhub actually.
[04:11:49] <dimadima> to be honest i've only ever disliked pizza once in my life and that was at chucke-cheese
[04:12:00] <manicennui> heh
[04:12:14] <dimadima> it was a jarring experience. i was a child and wouldn't have believed pizza could e bad
[04:12:25] <manicennui> I actually don't like deep dish very much, and I can't stand the default Chicago thin crust.
[04:12:50] <dimadima> no one actually eats deep dish pizza in chicago i can't figure out how those places stay open
[04:12:51] <manicennui> Basically Giordano's.
[04:12:55] <manicennui> Their pizza is gross.
[04:13:02] <manicennui> dimadima: Tourists and suburbanites.
[04:13:14] <dimadima> that shit is not right
[04:13:23] <manicennui> The Chicago style I like is referred to as tavern pizza.
[04:13:32] <dimadima> what's that

[04:13:48] <buttsbot> Where to eat Chicago tavern-style pizza - Eater Chicago
[04:14:11] <manicennui> It's basically thin crust, but the good places use far less cheese so it isn't a gooey mess.
[04:14:14] <manicennui> Much crisper.
[04:14:20] <dimadima> wow those are some beautiful pies
[04:14:27] <dimadima> manicennui:
[04:14:38] <dimadima> "pop" or "soda"?
[04:14:46] <manicennui> Soda.
[04:14:50] <manicennui> But I used to say pop.
[04:14:55] <dimadima> oh man and your'e from chicago?!?
[04:14:59] <dimadima> chicagoland
[04:15:12] <dimadima> pop really grew on me during my time there
[04:15:25] <manicennui> But my favorite styles are probably Neapolitan and New Haven.
[04:15:30] <manicennui> Sometimes I do Detroit style.
[04:15:55] <manicennui> There are tons of wood-fired semi-Neapolitan style pizza places in Chicago.
[04:15:55] <dimadima> wow
[04:15:56] *** Quits: jaix (~jaix@user/jaix) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[04:16:01] <dimadima> i'm not familiar with any of these styles
[04:16:06] <manicennui> But everyone wants to talk about our crappy pizza.
[04:16:11] <manicennui> dimadima: Piece is New Haven.

[04:17:11] <dimadima> ah i never knew that had a name
[04:17:32] <manicennui> dimadima: Yeah, that is what I like.
[04:17:40] <manicennui> Nice and crispy.
[04:17:48] <companion_cube> italy has even better pizza ;)
[04:18:27] <manicennui> ngoldbaum: I just don't even know what that would mean. We have the big floppy slices made NY style too. While I enjoy it that certainly isn't the best style of pizza.
[04:19:41] <manicennui> companion_cube: There are Neapolitan and Roman style places here, including places that have been DOC certified.
[04:19:50] <manicennui> Weird shit like importing the ovens from Italy.
[04:20:57] <manicennui> This place isn't quite that nuts but is considered one of the better places: https://www.spaccanapolipizzeria.com/
[04:20:58] <buttsbot> Spacca Napoli
[04:21:21] <manicennui> "baked in an oven built by third and fourth- generation artisans from Napoli"
[04:21:47] <manicennui> They import a bunch of ingredients from Italy too.
[04:22:15] <companion_cube> manicennui: I trust you :)
[04:22:36] <companion_cube> my parents' town has a guy who goes to Sicily every month for ingredients, it's also quite neat
[04:22:42] <dimadima> tbh food in new york is overrated. people are in a hurry, there's less room in kitchens to prep
[04:22:42] <companion_cube> but  they're not on the other side of the ocean
[04:23:00] <dimadima> companion_cube: woah
[04:23:20] <dimadima> for example, LA/SD easily have the best sushi culture i've seen in the US
[04:23:34] <dimadima> new york doesn't even come close
[04:23:54] <companion_cube> well, wrong coast :D
[04:24:05] <companion_cube> (my parents are in France, sicily ain't that far)
[04:24:05] <manicennui> I think Chicago's sushi is above average for the US, but nothing special.
[04:24:06] <dimadima> it's funny how that works though!
[04:25:05] <dimadima> people in chicago take food really seriously. i think people in new york get hoodwinked by places in nice locations
[04:25:07] <manicennui> It also has nothing to do with not being on the coast.
[04:25:14] <dimadima> the village or certain parts of brooklyn
[04:25:18] <manicennui> There are only a couple ingredients that are fresh.
[04:26:39] <dimadima> manicennui: that's what i would think, but then why would sushi in southern california be so much strinkingly better
[04:26:55] <manicennui> I think food on the West Coast is generally better.
[04:27:25] <dimadima> any reason come to mind?
[04:27:29] <companion_cube> I mean, if you want japanese immigrants, west coast is better, no>
[04:27:43] <companion_cube> and similarly, italian immigrants were historically on the east coast
[04:27:46] <companion_cube> that has to count for sth?
[04:27:47] <manicennui> dimadima: I think they care far more about ingredient quality on average.
[04:28:16] <manicennui> They might have higher expectations in general.
[04:28:41] <manicennui> There is a ton of awful food in Chicago.
[04:32:34] <manicennui> companion_cube: For Italian it barely matters because most Italian food in the US is an Americanized version of Italian food from on region of Italy.
[04:32:45] <manicennui> Would make some sense for Japanese.
[04:33:01] <manicennui> But I've just noticed that the average food quality seems to be higher whenever I go to the West Coast.
[04:33:14] <manicennui> Here you can't just count on getting a great meal wherever you go.
[04:38:43] <bkero> At least the Pacific Northwest is known for being obsessed about things -- food especially.
[04:39:05] <bkero> That combined with the availability of some of the best ingredients available in the US really helps.
[04:39:46] <manicennui> Here we seem to be obsessed with things that are excessive.
[04:39:48] <manicennui> And large portions.
[04:39:52] <bkero> California has a big farming region which helps a lot too.
[04:40:02] <manicennui> A lot of our food lacks nuance.
[04:40:13] <bkero> Heh yeah. Plus a region that can't grow fresh food for a lot of the year.
[04:40:25] <manicennui> But you also have a large number of the places that are serving the fast food we are known for just buying shit from Sysco or whatever.
[04:40:36] <bkero> Which means a lot of either imported things which are picked and shipped way before ripe, or pantry staples/frozen food.
[04:45:46] * dimadima eats trader joe's burrito
[04:46:08] <manicennui> I just wish you guys had water in the PNW.
[04:46:19] <bkero> Good news: it rained today
[04:47:00] <bkero> We have 36.91 inches of average rainfall yearly in Portland.
[04:47:14] <bkero> This year excluded, obviously. We still need a few inches to catch up.
[04:50:10] <manicennui> It's almost all during winter though.
[04:50:15] <manicennui> You have too much rain and then not enough rain.
[04:50:46] <bkero> 'eh
[04:50:51] <manicennui> The PNW is definitely one of the most beautiful parts of the country.
[04:51:10] <manicennui> But I just think there are going to be continued serious weather problems there.
[04:51:19] <bkero> Average precip days is > 13 for October through May
[04:51:37] <bkero> So 4 months out of the year where it rains less often than it doesn't.
[04:52:08] <bkero> Weather problems could be a risk, or this year could be an outlier. We'll see in the coming yeras.
[04:52:14] <manicennui> I don't know.
[04:52:22] <bkero> The Willamette Valley is still one of the most fertile regions of the country.
[04:52:29] <manicennui> I've been following Portland for several years, and it seems like droughts during summer have been common.
[04:52:34] <bkero> With about 60 feet of topsoil
[04:53:12] <bkero> Summers are always dry here, although droughts are not common. Recently it's been more common, although that could still be variance.
[04:53:22] <dimadima> bkero: you're saying that there are spots where the topsoil goes 60 feet blow the surface?
[04:53:28] <bkero> dimadima: Yes.
[04:53:31] <dimadima> woah.
[04:54:04] <bkero> Glacial Lake Missoula carved the valley and deposited it.
[04:54:11] <bkero> Or rather caused its formation
[04:54:47] <dimadima> that's awesome, in the literal sense
[04:55:10] <dimadima> if i ever knew there were 60 ft of topsoil beneath me, i would feel unstable
[04:55:22] <dimadima> i'm going to need some sand or clay or something
[04:55:23] <dimadima> :)
[04:55:47] <dimadima> here in maryland all we have is clay and rocks
[04:56:33] <bkero> I think that's fairly common, yeah
[04:56:49] <bkero> We have no rocks here
[04:57:11] <bkero> We have a theory that there is a convection current for rocks that sends them over there.
[04:58:15] <manicennui> Portland is the one city I could see myself living in other than Chicago.
[04:58:44] <manicennui> As far as urban areas.
[05:08:35] <manicennui> Maybe I should visit again next year.

[05:17:34] <dimadima> hahaha hey i think ngoldbaum deserves that highlight more
[05:18:00] <dimadima> i knee-jerk agreed about the pizza cause i'm sort of a dumbass but
[05:18:20] <dimadima> i have no taste for food or actualy any strongly-held opinions about it :)
[05:18:29] <dimadima> chicago has excellent food
[05:21:13] <dimadima> honestly i mostly eat dry roasted unsalted peanuts and apples
[05:21:59] <dimadima> it's borderline depressing
[05:22:17] <manicennui> We are required to fight to the death if anyone compares NYC and Chicago.

[05:23:20] <manicennui> Looks like flatbread
[05:23:38] <dimadima> i seriously thought italy didn't even have "pizza" per se like we in the US think of pizza
[05:26:10] <dimadima> clearly i am wrong
[05:28:14] <manicennui> Yeah, it's just that American pizza is quite a bit different.
[05:39:04] <dimadima> manicennui: what liver preparations do you like
[05:39:47] <manicennui> Chopped, pate, mousse...
[05:41:03] <dimadima> i bought some braunschweiger the other day
[05:41:24] <dimadima> fried chicken livers are good too imo
[05:41:45] <dimadima> man if there's one category of tech post that annoys me it's the "coverage != good tests" post
[05:42:09] <dimadima> is that really something that needs to be repeated so often
[05:42:54] <manicennui> Yes.
[05:43:03] <dimadima> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28642506
[05:43:03] <buttsbot> Coverage is not strongly correlated with test suite effectiveness | Hacker News
[05:43:04] <dimadima> realllly
[05:43:08] <manicennui> In the Ruby world, people are obsessed with coverage and write mostly terrible tests.
[05:43:13] <dimadima> jesus
[05:43:20] <dimadima> that's sad
[05:43:21] <dimadima> why
[05:43:45] <dimadima> top comment: In interpreted languages (ruby/python/etc) coverage at least tells you if there's a syntax error before running it in production, which is useful.
[05:43:46] <manicennui> Frankly, the dynamic languages generally attract less skilled developers.
[05:44:03] <dimadima> less skilled developers write tests?
[05:44:10] <manicennui> SUre.
[05:44:18] <manicennui> There is a really strong culture of writing tests in Ruby.
[05:46:50] <manicennui> A common complaint when hiring Rails developers is that they don't actually understand Ruby. They just know some Rails.
[05:46:50] <buttsbot> 👏 developers 👏 developers 👏 developers 👏
[05:47:15] <manicennui> So people will test candidates on writing basic classes outside of Rails.
[05:47:24] <manicennui> But it is also super common to write tests in Rails.
[05:47:32] <manicennui> And there are a lot of tools for coverage and such.
[05:48:15] <manicennui> That isn't to say there aren't a lot of terrible Java programmers.
[05:50:25] <dimadima> i see
[05:50:29] <dimadima> thank you
[05:50:54] <dimadima> testing is great fun
[05:51:27] <dimadima> but coverage, especially in dynamic languages, seems very much not like a good metric
[05:51:40] <manicennui> Of course not.
[05:51:57] <manicennui> Like with most things, the thing that is easy to measure gets measured.
[05:52:10] <manicennui> It's really hard to measure the quality of a test.
[05:58:01] <dimadima> and once you have a metric, people work to game the metric
[05:58:27] <dimadima> there's a lot of code that's pretty pointless to test
[05:58:50] <dimadima> personally i'd test most code if i had the time
[05:59:02] <dimadima> but gaming for coverage is the depths of banality
[05:59:14] <dimadima> i really enjoyed spock in java
[05:59:18] <dimadima> i guess groovy
[05:59:27] <dimadima> groovy is a fun language
[06:01:20] <dimadima> i've found that even if you don't have time to write tests, simply writing code that is testable gets you quite a long way
[06:01:51] <dimadima> like, "i can't test this now, but at least i'll write it so i don't have to factor this out into testable pieces later"
[06:02:37] <manicennui> I think that is one of the biggest problems though: I don't think most developers really know what makes code testable.
[06:02:58] <dimadima> yeah
[06:03:21] <dimadima> that is evident by the high incidence of comments like "forget unit tests! write integration tests"
[06:03:42] <manicennui> I've been in meetings with the entire dev team for the product I work on (20+ developers) and they will all agree that there is no way to tell whether code or tests are good just by looking at them.
[06:04:19] <manicennui> The thing that is truly baffling is that there are some great books on design and testing for Ruby, and many of them have read them, but seem unable to apply a single lesson from them to actual code.
[06:05:12] <manicennui> dimadima: I think part of the desire to focus on integration tests rather than unit tests is that people write code that isn't very testable, and they write highly coupled code.
[06:06:26] <dimadima> yes that's what i meaying
[06:06:29] <dimadima> i'm saying*
[06:06:32] <manicennui> I've seen shit so bad at work that the frontend and backend code have dependencies on each other, and then they can't figure out how to release it without a few minutes of errors.
[06:06:49] <dimadima> or, that's what it seems lik eto me
[06:07:33] <manicennui> I don't think that FP magically solves all of these issues (it does solve some of them), but most FP languages act as a filter to some extent on who you are likely to work with.
[06:07:52] <manicennui> I think that's probably another reason why I have no interest in TS: it doesn't really provide that filter.
[06:08:05] <manicennui> Other than the fact that it is just as ugly as JS.
[06:08:33] <dimadima> well part of what you learn by experience of programming is what to couple and what not to couple
[06:08:41] <dimadima> i would argue that's the main thing to learn
[06:08:44] <dimadima> cause that's largely an art
[06:08:53] <manicennui> Couple nothing!
[06:08:59] <dimadima> no way
[06:09:14] <dimadima> couple nothing?
[06:10:32] <dimadima> that really feels like premature optimization
[06:10:40] <manicennui> Nah.
[06:10:53] <dimadima> you end up with like 5 types that are the same
[06:10:57] <dimadima> but one is a domain type
[06:11:03] <dimadima> one is a blah blah something else type
[06:11:03] <dimadima> etc
[06:11:21] <dimadima> aka domain driven development
[06:13:17] <dimadima> i do like this statement though
[06:13:17] <dimadima> < manicennui> Couple nothing!
[06:18:53] <manicennui> dimadima: I suppose there are different types of coupling, and you are referring more to data coupling.
[06:19:35] <manicennui> I'm referring to the general problem of methods being designed around their callers, and changes to one almost always requiring a change to the other.
[06:20:01] <manicennui> And because they tend to have low cohesion, they gain more functionality as the caller has more needs.
[06:21:29] <manicennui> I think it's really easy to do because people promote every basic relationship to part of a larger concept.
[06:21:52] <manicennui> For instance we have a Customer class and a Loan class, and a large amount of functionality is implemented as methods on one of those things.
[06:22:08] <manicennui> And it might even seem like something like a payment is part of a loan, but it really isn't.
[06:22:14] <manicennui> But our Loan class has tons of payment logic.
[06:22:52] <manicennui> Instead of payments being a completely separate thing, and there being a process/service/whatever class that takes payment information, creates a payment, and then applies appropriate changes to the loan.
[06:22:55] *** Joins: sudoforge (~sudoforge@wireguard/tunneler/sudoforge)
[06:23:08] <manicennui> We do have multiple payment classes as well, but the logic is all tied together in the loan class.
[06:25:33] <manicennui> In order to test payments, one has to generate a customer, a loan, move the loan through a bunch of states, etc.
[06:28:45] <dimadima> well i didn't mean data coupling, i'm pretty sure
[06:28:57] <dimadima> but i also definitely did *not* mean:
[06:28:59] <dimadima> >  In order to test payments, one has to generate a customer, a loan, move the loan through a bunch of states, etc.
[06:29:09] <dimadima> that's what i call untestable code
[06:29:28] <dimadima> if i'm guilty of anything, it's mocking ad nauseum
[06:29:55] <manicennui> Depends on how you mock I think.
[06:30:03] <dimadima> which is why i enjoyed spock/groovy so much with java
[06:30:04] <manicennui> In Ruby, you can literally replace internal methods in classes.
[06:30:24] <manicennui> At some point, it's not clear what the point of some tests is when all of the internal methods get mocked out.
[06:30:33] <dimadima> yeah i don't mean monkeypatching if that's what you mean
[06:30:44] <manicennui> And then I see dumb crap like "expect this method to be called once".
[06:31:21] <dimadima> yeah when the point of a test stops being clear it's a good signal to me that the test doesn't necessarily need to exist
[06:31:30] <manicennui> Which makes extra sure that you'll have to update the test when you update its implementation.
[06:31:31] <dimadima> i'll have to come up with a good example of what i mean by coupling
[06:31:46] <manicennui> This is where I think FP wins.
[06:31:55] <manicennui> You have inputs and you have outputs.
[06:32:02] <manicennui> As much as possible.
[06:32:15] <dimadima> yeah
[06:32:20] <manicennui> Changing the internals of a pure function should never require changing the test.
[06:32:25] <manicennui> Unless things were wrong to begin with.
[06:33:00] <manicennui> With our code, the tests seem to mostly exist to alert us that we changed the code, which is generally the intent.
[06:33:06] <manicennui> And then you get to change the test too.
[06:33:11] <dimadima> lol
[06:33:13] <manicennui> They very rarely catch any actual problems.
[06:33:15] <dimadima> that sucs
[06:33:22] <dimadima> i'm sorry
[06:33:27] <dimadima> what language is this?
[06:33:27] <manicennui> And the test suite is slow and flaky.
[06:33:30] <manicennui> Ruby
[06:33:36] <dimadima> gosh that's a shame
[06:33:53] <dimadima> that's the worst
[06:34:12] <dimadima> is this something you inherited?
[06:34:58] <manicennui> Yes.
[06:35:04] <manicennui> They don't do a better job on new code though.
[06:35:09] <manicennui> This is basically the tradeoff I make.
[06:35:18] <manicennui> Almost everything else about the job is *way* better than average.
[06:35:45] <dimadima> that's good
[06:36:00] <manicennui> I know I'd probably have to trade something to work with different tech.
[06:36:11] <manicennui> Probably more hours.
[06:36:43] <manicennui> I barely even work 40 now, and during the summer it's even less.
[06:36:59] <manicennui> We go on call, but we basically never get called.
[06:37:10] <manicennui> I've never worked a weekend.
[06:37:35] <manicennui> There have been maybe a handful of times in the last 7 years that I have worked an hour or so outside of work hours due to some issue.
[06:38:06] <dimadima> yeah that is really nice
[06:38:15] <Church> Just had to 12k of tests
[06:38:29] <Church> That was fun, was basically all cp and paste at least
[06:38:34] <dimadima> i feel like tests in dynamic languages often just fail cause you changed the code
[06:38:55] <Church> But tbf it's basically just checking, hey do we still generate the same nginx config in the new daemon as we do the old?
[06:39:08] <dimadima> Church: 12k?
[06:39:10] <Church> I'd fucking hate to deploy this and goof something on our whole fleet
[06:39:29] <Church> dimadima: Like an 120~ line test per host for... 80 hosts~
[06:40:15] <manicennui> Church: I think you missed a word in your original statement.
[06:44:32] <dimadima> manicennui: have you ever used netty?
[06:45:13] <manicennui> I'm aware of it.
[06:47:27] <dimadima> sorry hold up i should really finish what i'm doing
[06:47:42] <indigo> manicennui: Lucky you! Even with all the meetings?
[06:48:00] <manicennui> indigo: Yeah, half my day is meetings.
[06:48:10] <manicennui> Then I do an hour or two of actual work.
[06:48:49] <indigo> I think I'm doing it wrong... I try to avoid meetings to do more "actual work"
[06:49:06] <manicennui> I start "working" just before 10, and end just before 5.
[06:49:17] <manicennui> indigo: I've tried. It doesn't work for me.
[06:49:21] <manicennui> I know too much.
[06:49:40] <manicennui> I should have done what some of my coworkers do and just never talk during meetings.
[06:51:26] <indigo> Do you feel like you have agency in a lot of the technical decisions?
[06:55:36] <manicennui> Sure, but there is a lack of practicality to do what is right.
[06:55:45] <manicennui> We are dealing with over a decade of tech debt.
[06:55:56] <manicennui> Progress is slow.
[06:56:28] <manicennui> I probably have more influence on our technical direction than anyone other than maybe my boss in some circumstance.
[06:56:38] <manicennui> But that is only because she oversees the entire team.
[06:56:54] <manicennui> And is highly technical herself.
[06:59:07] <manicennui> circumstances
[07:00:21] <indigo> That's good! I feel like I don't have much agency since I have to interface with so many other technical teams, and everyone wants a little piece done their way :P
[07:00:40] <manicennui> It helps that the product that I work on still makes most of our money.
[07:00:58] <Church> manicennui: Ah yes, I meant "had to write 12k~ lines of tests"
[07:01:26] <manicennui> Not counting our recent acquisitions, the other part of the company mostly uses the same set of shared services, and are highly interdependent.
[07:01:36] <manicennui> We mostly ignore them when we don't want to use their stuff.
[07:02:25] <manicennui> Everyone loves to talk about things we should be doing, but no one really wants to get involved, and no one has any real power to make us do it.
[07:02:47] <manicennui> Which is both good and bad.
[07:03:09] <manicennui> But as far as being able to dictate our own technical roadmap, it is good.
[07:08:45] <indigo> That's good!!
[07:11:22] <manicennui> It's good as long as it continues to pay me well without stressing me out.
[07:11:40] <manicennui> I'm tired of getting no enjoyment from my work though.
[07:17:06] <indigo> I mean, are you supposed to? ;)
[07:18:01] <manicennui> I don't know how to answer that.
[07:18:11] <manicennui> I want to.
[07:18:53] <manicennui> I think it is possible to get a bit of enjoyment from one's work.
[07:19:01] <manicennui> Or satisfaction.
[07:19:03] <manicennui> Something.
[07:30:08] <dimadima> manicennui: i think the kind of coupling you described i go to semi-extreme lengths to avoid
[07:30:34] <dimadima> like, i'll inject/close over an object/function that does serialization
[07:30:53] <dimadima> so in a test i can reduce that functionality to something extremely simple
[07:31:59] <dimadima> so the test only tests the functionality of the unit, and not some much greater thing like serialization that has nothing to do with the unit
[07:33:36] <dimadima> but sometimes it seems fine to have two coupled units that are separate just because it makes the testing simpler to test them separately
[07:34:01] <dimadima> gah i have to keep an eye out for an example
[07:34:12] <dimadima> good evening indigo

[15:25:47] <riv> thanks!
[15:28:55] <goodger> don't worry, it'll be different in a minute
[15:29:52] <riv> ^ the dude is still harassing me
[15:38:56] <gwozniak> Brekkjern: well that's a repo history I don't want to have to navigate
[15:40:14] <gwozniak> ``"We're not going to backpedal to a time where being racist was a thing," she said. "[Unvaccinated people] are being enslaved, they're being forced now not to be allowed to go out of their homes to go eat ... we're being owned by the government."''
[15:40:57] <gerikson> that.... is not how slavery worked
[15:41:00] <gerikson> (works)
[15:42:03] <gwozniak> That's a restaurant owner around here saying why they won't enforce checking for vaccine status at the entrance
[15:42:50] <gwozniak> And yes, the slavery comparison is as uninformed as you would expect
[15:44:17] <gwozniak> Also, I guess vaccines turn you into a different race now?
[15:44:25] <gwozniak> Following this logic makes my head hurt
[15:44:28] <prussian> I've seen worse repos.
[15:44:37] * skyl4rk is pfizer-american
[15:44:43] <prussian> ^
[15:44:52] <skyl4rk> (actually swedish though)
[15:45:04] <prussian> oh.
[15:45:30] <gerikson> technically slavery does not have to be racist... but racism was used to justify slavery because Black people weren't actually human
[15:45:49] <skyl4rk> don't really see the [origin]-[nationality] notation outside US context
[15:46:45] <prussian> don't overthink it.
[15:46:53] <prussian> no one gets it either
[15:47:06] <bontaq> they just so desperately want to be oppressed it's incredible
[15:47:12] <prussian> duh
[15:47:14] <prussian> idk
[15:47:29] <prussian> I wish I could say why, I know enough people anti-vaxx.
[15:47:48] <prussian> but I can't understand the mentality; it seems multi-faceted.
[15:48:19] <gwozniak> I know one family member who is, but I have not spoken to them in years so I don't know why
[15:48:41] <prussian> sounds like it is for the best.
[15:48:51] <gwozniak> Their mother was telling me it's because of "autonomy"
[15:48:57] <skyl4rk> if you are oppressed you are justified in lashing out, if the limitations put in place are benign and just, you can't
[15:49:00] <prussian> I know people who literally still think "Trump won" and that AZ audit proves fraud.
[15:49:01] <prussian> so
[15:49:05] <prussian> I am well in it
[15:49:22] <prussian> hell, I knew about the Cyber Symposium too, lol.
[15:50:42] <prussian> gwozniak: Is it though? It seems like one giant moving goalpost. they find some talking point, study, whatever and then it's some new battleground
[15:50:53] <prussian> I just think it comes down to some left v. right contrarianism crap
[15:50:56] <prussian> at this point.
[15:51:22] <gwozniak> prussian: I think he's so against anyone telling him anything that he should do that and he's trying to be "different" that he just rejects it
[15:51:36] <gwozniak> A very counter-culture kind of attitude
[15:51:50] <gwozniak> I doubt he truly believes in the autonomy thing
[15:52:11] <goodger> my dad's like that
[15:52:15] <goodger> not with vaccination, thankfully
[15:52:23] <gwozniak> He wants to be different _and_ right
[15:52:40] <goodger> but he resents cars beeping at him when he forgets his seatbelt
[15:52:40] <gwozniak> David v. Goliath kind of thing
[15:52:53] <goodger> he doesn't want an inanimate object telling him what to do
[15:53:00] <gwozniak> lol
[15:53:24] <prussian> so true...
[15:54:59] <skyl4rk> don't look into laser with remaining eye
[15:55:18] <prussian> wtf, you can't tell me what to do libtard.

[16:12:26] <prussian> oh, ok.
[16:12:29] <prussian> you say this now....
[16:13:08] <Brekkjern> wrl: I've told him off about it once before. I bet others have too.
[16:13:19] <skyl4rk> I assume this is something from elsewhere, non-public, or from time ago
[16:13:28] <Brekkjern> Seems so
[16:13:50] <wrl> actually checking my pms i had a conversation with riv about it some time ago as well
[16:14:37] <riv> I just want to say that the 'beef' is one way, i was not trying to do anything to antagonize him but he definitely became fixated on me after I changed my name to a gender neutral name for some reason

[16:17:22] <edk> +G is a relatively new addition
[16:18:03] <prussian> damn, cutting edge then
[16:19:42] <edk> it's a slightly weird feature
[16:20:07] <edk> also i guess +RG isn't redundant; +Rg would be

[16:20:31] <Xe> i forget how to check that
[16:20:44] <edk> we do, it won't let you set extbans that don't parse, but you can also ban matrix by IP

[17:50:03] <cb> it may be interesting to note distance between posting time-wise

[21:12:47] <Brekkjern> IMO, rule 11 of the internet is how most internet communities should work :P
[21:13:14] <dimadima> are these people taking the environment of moderated communities for granted? do they want these communities to go to shit?

[21:15:00] <buttsbot> Social rules - Recurse Center
[21:15:06] <prussian> oh
[21:15:07] <Brekkjern> So you can guess where these rules originated :P
[21:15:09] <dimadima> well who shared it is not relevant
[21:15:16] <dimadima> but specific rules like that seem sort of crazy to me
[21:15:30] <dimadima> if we're talking "Social rules"
[21:15:32] <prussian> well, /b/ brings me back, to strange times.
[21:15:37] <prussian> right
[21:15:38] <dimadima> social rules are either you're an asshole or you're not an asshole
[21:16:00] <dimadima> /b/, man
[21:16:06] <dimadima> what a place
[21:16:51] <dimadima> i've made the mistake of talking about b
[21:16:59] <dimadima> people didn't really think it was cool
[21:17:17] <Brekkjern> If I were to make a general rule set I would probably pick rule 10, 11, 20, 33, 38, 42, and 46 (because it's funny).

[21:17:53] <Brekkjern> For reference :P
[21:19:21] <dimadima> i just find it funny that of all the ways you can possibly be an asshole, people would focus on 4 specific ways
[21:19:31] <dimadima> and say "hey, here are the social rules"
[21:20:33] <dimadima> https://moraesmax.github.io/rules-of-the-internet/rule/20
[21:20:33] <buttsbot> #Rule 20
[21:21:13] <Brekkjern> Yep
[21:22:54] <Brekkjern> That page has a fucked up ruleset... Mine is closer to the original :P
[21:23:28] <ngoldbaum> dimadima: those specific rules help create an environment where people feel safe to ask questions, they’re also very common ways that people (especially people who don’t feel like they “belong” in a technical community) get subtly forced out of participating in the community
[21:24:08] <ngoldbaum> if you’re a straight, white or asian, cis male you’re probably not who the rules were written to support
[21:25:18] <ngoldbaum> also they’re explicitly not social laws, the code of conduct covers that stuff
[21:25:25] <riv> *Gasps* you don't know how to invert a binary tree? Well actually it's quite simple, here change line 7 there to "i++"
[21:25:35] <ngoldbaum> if you fuck up you’re supposed to get politely corrected, say sorry, and move
[21:25:37] <ngoldbaum> on
[21:25:55] <dimadima> ngoldbaum: i get that. and as i mentioned yesterday, i definitely am a proponent of CoCs
[21:26:13] <dimadima> i've been in environments with assholes
[21:26:30] <riv> same
[21:26:42] <dimadima> moderating them is like
[21:26:52] <dimadima> man, some people are just so manipulative
[21:26:52] <riv> feels like everyon in this channel is really awesome though
[21:27:03] <Brekkjern> This is why rule11 needs to apply...
[21:27:04] <dimadima> i think it's about excluding them in the first place is how you get to a good place
[21:27:06] <riv> yes and some people are really controlling
[21:27:10] <riv> it's so creepy
[21:27:26] <dimadima> but really i'm fascinated by the categorical imperative
[21:27:35] <dimadima> these *four* rules
[21:27:44] <Brekkjern> The fact that you haven't broken any actual rule does not make you immune to moderation. Moderators are not police. Mod "abuse" is "just fine"
[21:28:56] * dimadima shrugs 
[21:28:57] <dimadima> whatever
[21:29:09] <dimadima> god bless friendly groups of people
[21:29:12] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[21:29:40] <Brekkjern> My point is just that the rules don't give the users rights that cannot be violated
[21:30:04] <Brekkjern> Generally they just say what users can or cannot do
[21:33:29] <ngoldbaum> dimadima: if you look at https://www.recurse.com/10-years, they were invented piecemeal at the beginning of the program to correct issues the first facilitators saw
[21:33:30] <buttsbot> The Recurse Center
[21:33:47] <ngoldbaum> so it’s those *four* rules because that’s what seems to work
[21:34:07] <dimadima> yeah that's that's interesting to me. and i mean that sincerely
[21:34:53] <dimadima> it's one thing if we're talking about physical sciences where you have X fundamental forces or something
[21:35:36] <dimadima> but this is social stuff. it's interesting you can by experience reduce it to four things and it somehow seems to help a lot
[21:36:32] <ngoldbaum> from personal experience it does help a lot
[21:36:41] <ngoldbaum> i wouldn’t say RC is an asshole free enviornment
[21:37:02] <ngoldbaum> but the assholes certainly don’t make themselves known and are dissuaded from assholery by the rules
[21:37:35] <dimadima> that's fascinating
[21:37:53] <Brekkjern> Wheatons Law does work wonders too
[21:38:24] <dimadima> but does it? in a setting like RC?
[21:38:46] <dimadima> or, uh, would it?
[21:39:39] <Brekkjern> I don't see why not.
[21:40:16] <Brekkjern> All rules are pointless if they are not backed up by moderation, and as long as you apply rule 11 to the moderation, then a simple rule like "Don't be a dick" is just fine.
[21:40:31] <dimadima> i would argue that if you're systematically violating those four social rules, you're a dick and telling you not to be a dick isn't going to help
[21:40:49] <dimadima> well that's why i asked if/how those rules are enforced
[21:40:52] <Brekkjern> I agree. That's when you moderate them away.
[21:40:58] <ngoldbaum> people do get kicked out of the RC community
[21:41:03] <ngoldbaum> not a lot but it happens
[21:41:45] <dimadima> i meant ONLY telling you not to be a dick wouldn't help. it might help if you tell them specific things, such as those rules
[21:41:53] <Brekkjern> Having a list of rules helps people who want to stay "just within the rules" and/or the users to identify people going too far.
[21:42:34] <dimadima> ngoldbaum: have you done recurse?
[21:42:50] <ngoldbaum> also technical communities tend to attract neurodivergent people who find explicit rules much more helpful than vague guidelines
[21:43:01] <dimadima> Brekkjern: fwiw, that is probably enough to serve the function
[21:43:02] <ngoldbaum> dimadima: yup i was in-batch with shapr
[21:43:05] <prussian> screw the rules, I'm going in
[21:44:23] <dimadima> fun
[21:44:57] <Brekkjern> ngoldbaum: That is a good point, but as long as the community is small enough you don't have to ban on the first transgression. You do similar things to what we've done with goodger where we told him that he's going too far, and banned him when he didn't improve.
[21:45:31] <Brekkjern> If the community is so large that that kind of moderation is difficult to do, then temporary bans are probably better solutions.
[21:45:53] <dimadima> honestly i'm so socially anxious that when there are rules i just opt not to participate, due to anxiety alone
[21:46:00] <dimadima> if we're going to talk neurodivergence
[21:46:02] * ngoldbaum buys the outer wilds expack
[21:46:10] <riv> have fun!!
[21:46:13] <Brekkjern> Yeah. It's impossible to make it perfect for everyone
[21:46:28] <riv> dimadima: that seems very odd - there's rules everywhere
[21:46:43] <dimadima> riv: yeah i know it's pretty fucked up lol
[21:46:50] <dimadima> hehehe
[21:47:16] <dimadima> but you know, civil laws to me are different than social rules laid down in writing
[21:47:20] <ngoldbaum> dimadima: the first day in batch they do a little skit to defuse the scary vibes and make it clear they’re not laws that you can’t break and in fact people are constantly breaking the social rules and you’re supposed to notice and correct people and they’re supposed to apologize and then you move on
[21:47:24] <dimadima> rules of driving don't make me anxous
[21:47:25] <ngoldbaum> it’s not very high stakes
[21:47:33] <dimadima> rules of behavior are pretty anxiety provoking
[21:47:39] <ngoldbaum> i guess unless you’re so conflict averse that even that scares you
[21:48:07] <dimadima> i'm farily conflict averse. i think that's why the rules made such an impression
[21:48:27] <Xe> i'm really conflict averse too
[21:49:01] <ngoldbaum> lmao
[21:49:09] <ngoldbaum> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/LLKySHsw/IMG_3697.JPG
[21:51:11] <indigo> Heh, reminds me of Grounded, where you can adjust how the game renders spiders
[21:51:37] <indigo> IMO at a certain point, the "less freaky" spider actually became more freaky to me
[21:51:40] <Brekkjern> Satisfactory has an "arachnophobia" setting which honestly just makes them more scary...
[21:51:46] <indigo> RIGHT???
[21:52:30] <dimadima> Xe: are you joking or are you serious
[21:52:55] <dimadima> i wish i was less conflict averse
[21:52:59] <prussian> who the fuck isn't conflict averse?
[21:53:06] <prussian> well
[21:53:19] <prussian> I guess I am being combative for no reaosn
[21:53:22] <dimadima> i think that's the term that should have been introduced to this discussion
[21:53:22] <prussian> hmm
[21:53:38] <dimadima> hahaha i didn't read that as combative
[21:54:09] <dimadima> i don't know, many people are not conflict averse. it's an art and some people get it just right
[21:54:22] <dimadima> they can escalate perfectly and then de-escalate perflecty
[21:54:26] <indigo> There are many people that like to argue for arguments' sake :)
[21:54:33] <indigo> My mother is one of them ;)
[21:56:04] <dimadima> i have a neighbor who will say the exact opposite of what i say
[21:56:06] <dimadima> no matter what
[21:56:16] <prussian> damn
[21:56:20] <dimadima> "it's been really windy the lasst few days" -- "i don't think so, not really"
[21:56:28] <prussian> lmao
[21:56:34] <dimadima> okay, man.
[21:56:37] <dimadima> lol
[21:56:49] <dimadima> what am i even supposed to do with that. that's a real interaction i had a few days ago
[21:56:58] <dimadima> we were standing in the parking lot and the wind literally blew over a fucking tree
[21:57:10] <Xe> dimadima: i am super conflict adverse
[21:58:29] <dimadima> Xe: just thought i may be missed something there cause right after you said that ngoldbaum was laughing his ass off
[21:58:39] <dimadima> but i guess it was that image he pasted
[22:01:22] <indigo> Yeah I just reduce my interactions with those people lol
[22:03:54] <prussian> so true.
[22:04:06] <prussian> I just autopilot meetings. easy peeasy
[22:04:57] <riv> never saw the point of conflict, nobody is going to change their minds because I'm right and they're too stubborn to see that
[22:05:07] <prussian> damn
[22:05:12] <prussian> dark place
[22:05:18] <prussian> I gotta try to accept being dumb
[22:05:26] <prussian> or at least that's my mindset
[22:07:34] <indigo> I try to see it as a "meeting of the minds"; no one is necessarily "right" or "wrong"
[22:07:53] <indigo> You're just trying to hash out a path forward
[22:08:12] <riv> I used to believe in that but it turns out a lot of other people are not playing the same game
[22:08:42] <indigo> How so?
[22:09:21] <riv> idk trolls, cultists, that kind of thing

[22:10:06] <buttsbot> Drew Houston: 40-Hour Office Week Dead, Pandemic Changed Work Forever
[22:10:25] <manicennui> I'm actually pushing my manager to suggest to the higher ups that we have summer hours all year.
[22:10:28] <dimadima> riv: sure but at the same time i think there's some truth to this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_world_syndrome
[22:10:28] <buttsbot> Mean world syndrome - Wikipedia
[22:10:37] <manicennui> Which would give us a ~37 hour work week.
[22:10:40] <dimadima> as in, i think many of us think people are worse than they are
[22:11:00] <dimadima> manicennui: summer hours meaning leave early on friday?
[22:11:05] <manicennui> Yeah.
[22:11:45] <dimadima> pareto principle seems to apply widely and i think decent people fit into the 80%

[22:14:01] <manicennui> Alabama trying to use COVID relief funds for new prisons
[22:14:32] <manicennui> Alabama always comes up with new ways to remain the worst state in the US.
[22:15:31] <indigo> Alternatively, one of the teams here at work is RTO full time five days a week
[22:18:06] <indigo> Although RTO and # hours worked per week aren't really related
[22:18:47] <manicennui> Fortunately for employers they don't pay us for our commutes.
[22:26:38] <prussian> gotta keep the prisons going
[22:26:57] <prussian> some big rat looking things in alabama.
[22:27:33] <manicennui> Woah. Watching this video about this crazy environmentalist guy. He has a composting toilet, and to remove oders while pooping, they have an exhaust fan with the input down near the toilet.
[22:27:58] <prussian> icky
[22:28:02] <manicennui> So it sucks the air down.
[22:28:11] <manicennui> Seems much better than exhaust fans above.
[22:28:17] <prussian> well sure
[22:28:22] <manicennui> The icky part is that he pees into bottles.
[22:28:39] <prussian> gotta collect the salts somehow
[22:28:42] <manicennui> And so does his wife with a bucket and a funnel.
[22:29:52] <manicennui> He is now explaining that he can poor his own pee onto his personal gardening plot (they have a huge communal garden).
[22:30:05] <manicennui> s/poor/pour/
[22:30:44] <manicennui> There is also a communal pee container that they somehow use to sanitize the pee.
[22:30:53] <prussian> damn
[22:33:52] <manicennui> I'm totally with this guy on the garden, but the toilet stuff is a bit much.
[22:34:02] <manicennui> Like I might be willing to use a composting toilet with camping.
[22:34:11] <manicennui> s/with/while/
[22:34:49] <manicennui> And saving pee in a jar is just nasty.
[22:36:03] <dimadima> tell that to david bowie
[22:37:26] <companion_cube> don't you like amonia?
[22:40:19] <dimadima> i believe by mass amonia (or amonium?) the largest produced chemical by humans
[22:40:22] <dimadima> i mean synthetically
[22:40:46] <dimadima> a huge chunck of our chemical industrial exertion goes to producing amonia
[22:40:50] <dimadima> chunk
[22:41:33] <manicennui> There is probably a good use for pee.
[22:41:51] <manicennui> Install pee hoses in everyone's homes.
[22:41:54] <dimadima> yeah in ancient rome that was a huge job
[22:41:56] <manicennui> Collect it in a giant tank.
[22:42:02] <dimadima> people went around collecting pee
[22:42:26] <manicennui> It would probably make sense for men to pee into hoses.
[22:42:45] <manicennui> Maybe have a short length of tube that you attach to the end for each user.
[22:43:21] <dimadima>  In fact, in ancient Rome, vessels for collecting urine were commonplace on streets–passers-by would relieve themselves into them and when the vats were full their contents were taken to a fullonica (a laundry), diluted with water and poured over dirty clothes. A worker would stand in the tub of urine and stomp on the clothes, similar to modern washing machine’s agitator.
[22:43:51] <manicennui> Hope no one in your area has some UTIs or something.
[22:44:21] <dimadima> i'm not sure pee would be a good source of ammonia these days
[22:44:36] <dimadima> compared to industrial processes. but who knows, maybe
[22:44:51] <manicennui> I'm sure collecting it wouldn't be cost effective.
[22:45:00] <dimadima> i worked in an STI lab in high school and early collect. i processed a lot of pee
[22:45:30] <dimadima> we ran the STI testing for much of the free clinics in baltimore
[22:45:49] <dimadima> some of the pee was pretty gnarly
[22:46:14] <dimadima> manicennui: yeah i don't think it would be cost effective
[22:46:49] <dimadima> I do love Hasrua
[22:46:52] <dimadima> Hasura*
[22:47:21] <manicennui> We spent a couple years talking about graphql and then never used it.
[22:47:47] <dimadima> i feel like the early approaches weren't the greatest
[22:48:11] <dimadima> the ones like hasura where you automatically build schemas from databases i think are good
[22:48:24] <dimadima> defining and building schemas by hand is a lot of effort
[22:48:59] <manicennui> Seems like it should have been very straightforward for Rails apps.
[22:49:23] <dimadima> i bet that exists?
[22:50:28] <manicennui> Possibly.
[22:52:01] <manicennui> Despite this guy's bathroom practices, I kind of want to live around people like this.
[22:52:53] <dimadima> yeah i have really extreme environmental tendencies
[22:53:19] <dimadima> that have only been tempered by a need to function
[22:53:27] <manicennui> It's more that I think these people are probably really chill and eat a lot of vegetables and probably do drugs.
[22:54:05] <manicennui> But I don't think I'd have to worry about people like this suddenly wanting to build strip malls and fast food restaurants.
[22:56:09] <manicennui> My mind constantly cycles back and forth between wanting to remain in Chicago and wanting to move somewhere with natural beauty where I can have a large garden.
[22:56:35] <manicennui> Oh sweet. They have an outhouse.
[22:57:49] <bkero> Go west, young man
[22:58:47] <manicennui> bkero: I'm leaning more toward Asheville if I leave Chicago.
[22:59:28] <bkero> That is not west.
