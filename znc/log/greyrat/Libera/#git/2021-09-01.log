[07:05:55] <twb> Dumb question: does that mean a "ln -s fartplan timetable" and "printf fartplan >timetable.txt" will both be stored as the same blob?
[07:07:05] <cluelessperson> twb, it'll double up the contents of timetable,  which fartplan symbolically links to,  not sure if it'll run endlessly though
[07:07:17] <cluelessperson> don't think it will.
[07:07:50] <rewt> I count 29 advice.* variables in man git config
[07:07:50] <gitinfo> the git-config manpage is available at https://gitirc.eu/git-config.html
[07:08:42] <twb> cluelessperson: er, I think you misunderstood the question
[07:09:34] <pyeveryt_> does anyone have a bit time help me figure why the git push doesn't change anything in remote repository? thanks
[07:09:54] <twb> I'm asking if a symlink target and a regular file's contents, when identical, will be stored as a single blob object (shared by both tree objects) in .git
[07:10:40] <cluelessperson> twb, they'll both be symbolic links to timetable
[07:10:54] <cluelessperson> ugh, I misspoke
[07:11:05] *** Joins: lgc (~lgc@user/lgc)
[07:11:28] <cluelessperson> no,  fartplan will be a symbolic link and timetable.txt will be another file entirely.
[07:11:55] <cluelessperson> So how do I shut git up?
[07:12:10] <cluelessperson> I don't want verbose stderr output in automation
[07:13:56] <pyeveryt_> could you please have a look? https://pastebin.com/raw/BNs8DjnZ git push keeps telling Everything up-to-date

[07:21:16] <pyeveryt_> master is what I want to be seen on my repo
[07:21:25] <pyeveryt_> but shows as a pull request twb
[07:21:57] <twb> pyeveryt_: so you basically want to end up with one branch, "master", and get rid of "main" entirely?
[07:23:07] <cluelessperson> why is git outputting stuff to stderr that ISN'T an error
[07:23:07] <twb> pyeveryt_: "git branch -a", make sure locally you have "master" and it has the commits you want ("git log master").  Then delete main locally "git branch -d main", push master upstream "git push -u origin master", then delete main upstream "git push --delete origin main"
[07:23:44] <twb> pyeveryt_: you might also have to do something in the github UI to make master the default in the web UI
[07:24:39] <twb> pyeveryt_: personally I would do all that the other way around, so only "main" remains, because that's the current default.  But whatever.
[07:25:21] <pyeveryt_> yes one branch twb

[11:06:11] <euouae> I think that's the one twb
[11:07:02] <twb> commit.c:sign_with_header appears to be straightforward
[11:08:05] <twb> That then goes to gpg-interface.c
[11:08:29] <euouae> the sign_with_header() function seems to point at sign_buffer(). I've followed through until I was lost
[11:08:33] <twb> But I don't see a fork and I don't see gpgme
[11:08:55] <twb> Ah well strvec_pushl has what looks like exec args
[11:10:19] <euouae> oh wait is that where it happens?
[11:10:23] <euouae> I didn't check the tone
[11:10:25] <euouae> that one*
[11:10:27] <twb> " * A new run-command API function pipe_command() is introduced to sanely feed data to the standard input while capturing data from the standard output and the standard error of an external process, which is cumbersome to hand-roll correctly without deadlocking."
[11:10:45] <twb> euouae: strvec is creating a vector, representing the exec args that gpg will get
[11:10:56] <twb> Then pipe_command set up the pipeline (i.e. actually runs gpg, somewhere)
[11:11:15] <euouae> I can't spot it, I wen through pipe_command()
[11:11:18] <twb> euouae: I'm looking at this cold, i.e. ICBW, but it looks pretty clear to me.
[11:11:24] <twb> OK
[11:12:38] *** jazzy2 is now known as jazzy
[11:14:27] <euouae> It should be around `start_command()` but the only substantial functions it calls are `trace2_child_start(cmd);` and `trace_run_command(cmd);`, the first documented to just print stuff, and the second having no exec statements that I see
[11:14:54] <twb> start_command calls execve aronud :852

[11:15:32] <euouae> Oh YEAH! I didn't realize start_command continues past line 800

[15:17:12] <ExeciN> hi people. I'm trying to perform a git command such as `git push --delete origin 1.0.0` but the wrong user used to authenticate over ssh. I have multiple identities (work and personal) so I'm wondering if there is a way to specify which username to use
[15:17:41] <osse> ExeciN: several ways.
[15:18:05] <osse> ExeciN: You can for example change the URL of origin to use a host alias and then configure it in ~/.ssh/config
[15:18:43] <osse> You can also specify a one-off custom ssh command with  GIT_SSH_COMMAND='ssh -oFoo -i bar etc.' git push
[15:19:02] *** Joins: rewrit3 (~rewrit3@user/rewrit3)
[15:20:09] <ExeciN> osse: the remote doesn't have any mention of a username (except from the git part)
[15:21:00] <osse> That's normal
[15:21:30] <osse> If you literally mean use a different OS-level username than 'git' you can push directly to the correct URL
[15:21:56] <osse> But usually everone uses the 'git' user, and the key determines which human is doing it.
[15:22:44] <ExeciN> I have set git.user but it still uses the other identity
[15:23:03] <ExeciN> *I mean user.name

[15:23:46] <ExeciN> could this be because of ssh-agent?
[15:23:47] <osse> The stuff in .gitconfig is irrelevant for authentication
[15:24:05] <osse> That only affect the commit info (author etc)
[15:24:07] <Guest25> ExeciN: I'd add a ssh config in ~/.ssh/config and use that `Host` in the remote url

[15:38:02] <Guest25> ExeciN: Can we see your `git remote -v`?
[15:38:17] <osse> ExeciN: because github identifies you with the key you're using.

[18:41:42] *** Joins: AnAverageHuman (~AnAverage@user/anaveragehuman)
[18:41:44] <osse> In post-receive it's presumably too late, because the ref has already been updated
[18:42:08] <osse> in pre-receive you can check if the ref already has a value if the provided old value is 00000000, and if so, it's a forec push
[18:42:09] <Soni> oh right the objects could be gone already hmm
[18:42:59] <Soni> force pushes look like any other push remote: b'21177a2933b1a9d21d8437159405c5bc68b4d32e 3ea9318f6271ece3c7560f18d0b22f50bd3cefe5 refs/heads/default\n'
[18:43:11] <osse> he only mention of force in githooks is in the new reference-transaction hook I hadn't heard of before
[18:43:14] <Soni> deletes are neat remote: b'21177a2933b1a9d21d8437159405c5bc68b4d32e 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 refs/heads/default\n'
[18:43:16] <osse> I just assume pre-receive works the sam eway
[18:43:28] <osse> oh
[18:43:54] <osse> in that case check if the old value is an ancestor of the new. it it isn't then it's a force
[18:44:00] <Soni> but yeah not sure how to do cleanup on delete/force-push other than rebuilding the whole HTML view of the repo

[18:44:26] <Soni> (as in, the *whole* thing)
[18:44:43] <Soni> (rather than just cleaning up removed objects)
[18:46:05] <osse> yeah that sounds a bit difficult

[18:51:40] <jellycode> greetings.  question:  is there a git command/workflow which lets me generate docs on a feature branch, then, checkout the "gh-pages" branch, and somehow copy and commit the generated docs on top of gh-pages.  the tricky part is the branches have unrelated history, and we don't want to merge them.
[18:52:03] <osse> I don't know. But any objects that become "deletable" by a push aren't eligible for cleanup by git gc anyway
[18:52:21] *** Quits: vysn (~vysn@user/vysn) (Quit: WeeChat 3.2)
[18:52:49] <Soni> oh, why's that?
[18:53:03] <xx> I'm trying to solve a situation that I don't see described online: I want to move two commits around, without dropping either of them, but they cause a merge conflict.
[18:53:36] <xx> So instead of having a merge conflict resolution squash the two commits together, I want the first one to be applied, and then the next commit to be based on the first one
[18:53:44] <xx> how do I do that?
[18:53:47] <osse> Soni: nvm, I'm not thinking clearly.
[18:53:57] <jellycode> Haha xx ; you and i are having kind of similar questions
[18:54:11] <xx> jellycode: most people are having the same questions, because git is not intuitive at all
[18:54:46] <Soni> rebase --interactive?
[18:54:53] <jellycode> All the strategies i'm trying now end up in conflict, and i think maybe it's impossible because fundamentally, all the GIT commands I can find wants to bring over a "commit" which will ultimately be related to the history of "main".  My goal is to take changes in the working directory created while on one branch, and copy/apply to a totally
[18:54:54] <jellycode> unrelated branch.

[18:55:15] <Soni> maybe cherry-pick also?
[18:55:23] <xx> Soni: yes, I'm doing the interactive rebase, where I switch the order of two commits
[18:55:31] <jellycode> I don't think i've tried cherry-pick , let me look
[18:55:38] <osse> Soni: Git itself runs git gc from time to time. So unless you actively run git gc on the side yourself I would assume nothing interferes with the hooks
[18:56:56] <Soni> osse: yeah but, what are the details of that?
[18:57:06] <osse> xx: if you get conflicts when you reorder them you will have to fix it
[18:57:12] <osse> Soni: what do you mean
[18:57:22] <xx> osse: yes, I want to fix it... that's why I'm asking :)
[18:57:31] <braxas> how do I get the current state of my working directoy to match that  of a specific commit while not changing any history?
[18:57:41] <xx> braxas: git checkout <hash>
[18:58:38] <osse> xx: what you are doing already sounds correct to me
[18:59:04] <Soni> xx: you have to do it manually
[18:59:27] <osse> fix the conflicts, git add the files, git rebase --continue
[18:59:51] <braxas> Maybe I should explain better, I have a branch with N commits, and then I have another with 1 commit. I want to make it look like the branch with 1 commit is on top of the N commits, but merging/rebasing is a bit of a mess, so I want to just  change the stuff in working directory to the 1 commit's branch, and then do git commit --reuse-message commit_ref
[19:00:28] <osse> braxas: git checkout commit_1 -- . && git commit -C commit_1
[19:00:59] <osse> if that commit also deletes files it gets a bit trickier, but it's doable
[19:02:40] <Soni> osse: what guarantees does git make about when it runs git gc, does it run gc after post-receive or could post-receive see commit IDs (on stdin) that don't exist anymore, etc etc
[19:03:09] <Soni> also git prune doesn't seem to inspect packfiles, is that correct? so it might not be useful for figuring out stuff to delete...
[19:03:28] <xx> let's see if I understand it correctly: I do an interactive rebase, and git tells me "oh noes, merge conflict". So I edit the conflicting file to look like I want the *first* commit to make it look, then do rebase --continue and git tells me again "oh noes, merge conflict" so I now edit the same file to look like I want the *second* commit to appear
[19:03:29] <xx> right?
[19:03:36] <Soni> (like an accidental commit of secrets)
[19:03:42] <osse> Short answer: I don't know. The docs just say that Git will invoke git gc --auto at the end of commands that are expected to produce a lot of objects.

[20:55:51] <davis> hello, I am trying to test builds of various tags from a git repot.  I did a `git checkout tags/sometag -b sometag` and I got an error msg of `the following untracked working tree files would be overwritten by a checkout. Aborting`  It gives a whole list of files.  I tried to do a `git stash` and it says not local changes to save.
[20:56:22] <davis> how do i get this particular revision out without removing directory and redoing a git clone first?
[20:58:34] <cbreak> davis: the untracked files would be overwritten
[20:58:38] <cbreak> do you want to delete them?
[20:59:13] <davis> i dont care if they are deleted. I am trying to get a working build with any "verfied" tag.
[20:59:23] <cbreak> then git clean -fdx
[20:59:25] <davis> the particular tag I'm using at the moment fails to build
[20:59:34] <davis> so I am trying to pull another one.
[20:59:41] <davis> ok let me try that
[20:59:42] <cbreak> that will delete untracked files
[20:59:48] <cbreak> that deletion will not be recoverable
[21:00:15] <davis> hmm. git clean -fdx says its deleting somethings
[21:00:45] *** Quits: arcatech (~arcatech@user/arcatech) (Quit: Bye.)
[21:00:48] <davis> however a reissue of $ git checkout tags/sometag -b sometag has same error
[21:01:11] <davis> untracked files will be deleted by checkout and then aborting
[21:01:22] <davis> do I simply rm these files by hand?
[21:01:40] <cbreak> you can try
[21:01:45] <cbreak> but git clean would do that
[21:01:53] <Soni> osse: the "dangling commit" is the only thing on stdout
[21:02:09] <Soni> but it's useless because everything is dangling but it doesn't show that
[21:02:28] <cbreak> if the files are ignored, you can try to remove the -x
[21:03:00] *** Joins: keir (~keir@user/keir)
[21:03:00] <davis> hmm. rm -rf lib/nrf lib/nrfx enabled me to checkout the new tag.
[21:03:10] <cbreak> oh, libs
[21:03:14] <cbreak> those might be submodulees

[22:50:42] <jellycode> HI all.  Jenkins checks out git repo in a sparse way, which I get.  But, at the end of the job i'm trying to checkout a branch ("gh-pages") and I get an error on checkout:  "fatal: 'origin/gh-pages' is not a commit and a branch 'gh-pages' cannot be created from it"  ,
[22:51:02] <jellycode> I'm doing "git fetch origin gh-pages" and then "git checkout -t -b gh-pages origin/gh-pages"
[22:51:28] <imMute> jellycode: 'git fetch --unshallow origin'
[22:51:55] <jellycode> How does the unshallow work exactly?
[22:53:15] <jellycode> I'm trying it now to get unblocked, but I want to make sure it doesn't have negative implications
[22:53:26] <imMute> it fetches all the pieces that were skipped in the original shallow clone
[22:53:55] <imMute> there's no negative implications other than it's going to use disk space to store those objects (as if you had done a full clone in the first place)
[22:54:20] <jellycode> if i do "git fetch --unshallow origin gh-pages" does that avoid getting all the pieces not related to gh-pages?
[22:54:39] <imMute> I'm not sure about that.
[22:54:53] <jellycode> "-unshallow on a complete repository does not make sense"   ... wait what?
[22:55:38] <imMute> I think "complete" means "not shallow"
[22:56:47] *** Quits: CSWookie (~CSWookie@144.202.134.98) (Quit: Client closed)
[22:57:49] <jellycode> yes i agree, but it doesn't make sense that i have one error saying it doesn't know anything about a branch named gh-pages, which seemed clearly related to the shallow clone, and then another error saying the clone is not shallow
