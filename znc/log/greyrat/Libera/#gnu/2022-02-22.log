[06:00:01] <Ribby> Hello guys, I was playing thru pureos, and I didn't like the blur out of focus when accessing menus in the gnome3 desktop environment interface. I am installing it right now just to see the full installation in action. However, I am preferable to 32 bit compatibility per release version. I read that trisquel and parabola are the GNU ones. I also read about hyperbola being better than parabola? I read that hyperbola isn't as GUI friendly 
[06:00:02] <Ribby> so it's somewhat of a concern despite security needs.
[06:01:43] *** Quits: junebug (~junebug@2600:1700:3db0:2540:7d00:994:fd3c:897e) (Quit: Leaving)
[06:01:59] <Ribby> Can I easily install a graphical desktop environment on hyperbola easily? Are there differences between LXDE  and XFCE?
[06:03:06] <jxself> "Easily" probably is a relative term. The best way is probably to experiment and see what you like, and what you find to be eay.
[06:03:18] <jxself> ...to be easy.
[06:03:39] <Ribby> At least it's 32 bit? ;)
[06:05:20] <Ribby> I'm also a bit concerned about size requirement in os installation. Like, do I need plenty of usb space for a successful os boot installation?
[06:06:31] <jxself> Trisquel coudl also have 32-bit support. It all depends on whether people step up to help out - https://trisquel.info/en/forum/call-volunteers-maintain-32-bit-support
[06:08:02] <jxself> It appears that, in the end, no one showed up. Trisquel 9 is still supported at this point.
[06:09:19] <jxself> I personally like distros that have the policy to freeze package version numbers on release and only apply bug and security fixes, like Trisquel does. It lets me get busy on the work that I want to be doing, not tracking down some problem that happpened from the latest round of updates. I like my distros to be boring and uneventful. 
[06:09:45] <Ribby> Yeah, I don't know if it's me, but I got 'isolinux.bin missing or corrupt' message. It's on a legacy/bios boot, no uefi boot. uefi is usually for 64 bit. It appears that my tested machine is for 32 bit.
[06:10:27] <isf> you can still download Trisquel 9
[06:10:31] <Ribby> Ah, to just get on with your life. Still, learning is a process.
[06:10:34] <isf> from https://mirror.fsf.org
[06:10:51] <isf> i recommend install it becouse support 32 bits and have support to the 2023
[06:11:02] <Ribby> I'll keep that in mind. Thanks for helping.
[06:11:10] <jxself> isf: You aan also download it direct from Trisquel too via https://cdimage.trisquel.info/
[06:11:29] <jxself> Or probably from any of the other mirrors too :)
[06:11:35] <isf> jxself what go to happen when we cant have a free distro with support with a guided install?
[06:12:06] <jxself> You mean on 32-bit?
[06:12:12] <isf> yes
[06:12:37] <isf> i can understend the kiss ideology but that can maybe be bad for a new user trying install parabola without a installation guide
[06:12:56] <isf> as a GNU Guix, for example they have a instalation guided
[06:13:19] <jxself> I don't know. I am still holding out hope that there will be volunteers interested in helping maintain 32-bit stuff on Trisquel before 9.0 becomes EOL in April 2023.
[06:14:02] <jxself> For now I do what I can. I still building 32-bit kernels for Linux-libre. I have no plans on stopping: https://jxself.org/32-bit.shtml
[06:14:16] <jxself> But I can't take on a whole distro. That is a lot of work and I don't have that time.
[06:20:14] <Ribby> It appears that I have to do some code before hyperbola becomes GUI.
[06:20:16] <Ribby> https://itsfoss.com/hyperbola-linux-review/
[06:20:37] <jxself> It is very similiar to Arch in that aspect.
[06:21:30] <Ribby> I hope that the arch interface navigation isn't as different from other GNUs.
[06:21:44] <isf> we need a free distro with guided installation as parabola with the support for 32bits 
[06:22:42] <jxself> I agree that it is good to continue to support that hardware for the reasons I outlined in that article.
[06:24:39] <isf> maybe a "no-kiss version haha
[06:24:45] <Ribby> I actually like guix very much, but it seems to require the proper wifi card for full internet access. Still, such a feature would be good to limit internet access. Removal of wifi card will require safekeeping somewhere.
[06:24:50] <isf> a "no-official"
[06:25:12] <isf> i recommend you the ethernet cable Ribby
[06:25:23] <isf> or buy a doungle with a compatible wifi card
[06:26:25] <Ribby> It really depends on the build of the computer, but I get the choices of compatibility given to me. :)
[06:33:16] <Ribby> commands of arch isn't so different from the main linux commands, right? I mean, there's pacman?
[06:40:40] <isf> sorry but linux isnt a operating system
[06:41:21] <isf> here in the GNU Official channel we say GNU Operating system with the linux-libre kernel for be specific
[06:41:35] <Ribby> Okay, can I at least get confirmation that Arch Linux uses different commands?
[06:41:38] <isf> but say "linux" as a operating system is a wrong way to speak about the GNU System
[06:42:17] <isf> Arch GNU/Linux use pacman package manager
[06:42:27] <Ribby> Okay, so linux is actually a system component for operation system software.
[06:42:52] <Ribby> That's about it, right? Like make, guix, apt, etc?

[06:43:23] <isf> linux is just a nonfree kernel what the nonfree distro use normaly with the GNU Operating System, but not the package manager isnt all commands you use in your GNU Operating System
[06:43:42] <isf> Guix for example, is the official package manager of the GNU Project
[06:43:49] <isf> but you can use others, like for example APT
[06:43:53] <isf> or Pacman
[06:44:05] <isf> in Parabola GNU/Linux-libre we use Pacman
[06:44:14] <isf> in Trisquel GNU/Linux-libre we use APT
[06:44:26] <isf> they are package manager, for install, remove update the software etc
[06:44:39] <Ribby> There's plenty of them.
[06:46:01] <Ribby> Okay, what do you call a Ubuntu? It's own operating system? What exactly is a kernel? I apologize if I am being repetitive.

[07:03:44] <Ribby> Will there be a 32 bit architecture?
[07:04:01] <jxself> That depends on if anyone volunteers to maintain it.

[07:11:21] <Ribby> np
[07:11:47] <Ribby> I'll take the specific discussion once ready.
[07:13:58] <Ribby> Why isn't guix on https://mirror.fsf.org/?
[07:14:35] <jxself> Probably no one set up a mirror? Maybe the Guix people never asked?
[07:14:43] <jxself> I can only speculate.
[07:15:04] <Ribby> It's useful to keep backup mirror servers.
[07:15:14] <jxself> I think Guix does have mirrors?
[07:16:41] <jxself> But a question of what mirrors they have and why they do not use FSF is probably a question best for the Guix people? I am only a random person. :)

[23:39:26] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> "The Hacker Monarch (= The Messiah) ¶
[23:39:26] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> Photo of Summer Glau from the English Wikipedia
[23:39:26] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> I concluded that I was the hacker king/warrior king (or the Messiah) between roughly 2000 and up-to-and-until the publication of the informal screenplay “Summerschool at the NSA”. At that point, one of my “Galateas”, the lovely and real-life Summer Glau, became an “apple that completely supplanted the tree”.
[23:39:26] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> I realised that she likely wants to be the hacker monarch even more badly than I have, throughout all the years I was the hacker king of the world. The hacker monarch is also known as “The Best of the Best of the Best” to paraphrase on the excellent film Men in Black. Despite whatever faults she or I had, we are both full of awesomeness."
[23:39:33] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> ths is very selfcentered^^
[23:39:50] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> ego is a dangerous thing ;)
