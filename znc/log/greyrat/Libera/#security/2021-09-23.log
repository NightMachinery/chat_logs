[08:14:02] <Descartes> That's why I've been putting off a full installation of Windows 10 for so long.  I knew it would take a lot of time to install and configure all the software so the system is secure
[08:14:35] <Descartes> With Linux, that can be done in a couple days and you have a fully functioning OS
[08:14:59] *** Joins: drewgon (~drewgon@159.196.19.188)
[08:15:39] <Descartes> But with Windows, it's so much freaking work, and I have so little experience with Windows networking and security.  to me, it's just a nightmare that never ends
[08:16:58] <Descartes> I'm not a coder or a programmer, and I don't even know HTML, so configuring a secure OS on Windows 10 is time consuming

[22:22:47] <piou> ghostbuster: if that's the specific threat model you consider (attacks that target passwords) then sure sso is going to get you there in a more sure way than a password manager. But I just think important to note that you're dismissing many potentially valid threat models. For example you now have a separate entity (which can be part of your company of course) managing your authentication so any
[22:22:53] <piou> admin of that platform may interfer with it. You're closing a door tightly shut, but you're opening a window somewhere else.
