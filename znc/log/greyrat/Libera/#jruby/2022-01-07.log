[00:00:59] <headius> segv in FFI specs trying to pass a Ruby function to C as a callback
[00:01:10] <headius> this might have something to do with limitations on data/exec memory on M1
[00:01:25] <headius> security stuff
[00:07:42] <headius> hah I thought I'd check if the C ext fixes this but they have gobs of M1 bugs that don't appear to be going anywhere
[00:20:21] <adam12> I shared this a week or so back but I think everybody was on vacation. Does this look like an M1 issue? https://gist.github.com/adam12/6f445d8b7e8064cb0bb53b5c15eda6fc

[00:27:26] <jamesgecko[m]> I have a bizarre issue on my M1 MacBook where jruby shows permission issues whenever it installs a gem. This is what happens when I try to install jruby via ruby-build, but I get similar errors when using jgem after installing jruby from homebrew.... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/cd9c8ed423389d2c18828ea3bc9a36f9a917911c)

[00:29:00] <headius> Funny you should mention that... We just merged a bunch of fixes for M1 today
[00:29:23] <headius> They are not in a release yet but you could download a snapshot
[00:29:55] <jamesgecko[m]> Oh, whoops, I guess I should have scrolled up. Is M1 support still WIP? I guess I assumed Java was automatically portable.
[00:46:28] <jamesgecko[m]> It works! Kinda. Seems like Sorbet is just borked on this codebase, native binary or not, haha. Thanks!
[00:47:12] <headius> Great news! I would say support is still in progress but I just fixed the last major issue I knew of. Now we run through test suites and fix any straggling issues

[18:51:19] <enebo[m]> kares: I pushed jdbc-h2 with updated jar since sequel still supports h2.  It is pretty low support for this so I am happy to keep releasing any of those dbs people care to use

[20:34:04] <kares[m]> cool was planning to do the same, MySQL is also on my list but from the changeling I wasn't sure if things will be smooth ... need to run AR MySQL tests
