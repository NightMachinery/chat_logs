The things I liked about it the most so far was tracking updates with yay -Qua. I saw AUR helpers aren't officially supported and I wonder how much I'll lose by ripping yay off my computer and doing it manually.
[02:49:24] <Namarrgon> remove it and find out

[04:48:24] <CodeSpelunker> as for flatkill, seemed like the flatpak people didn't think it was a big deal
[04:48:36] <CodeSpelunker> sheep: good to know :) wasnt aware
[04:49:04] <thurstylark> imo, the fact that the devs are ignoring security concerns *is* the big deal.

[04:51:16] * thurstylark must be out of the loop if people aren't trusting *firefox* to run on their main os nowadays :/
[04:51:35] <CodeSpelunker> makes me wonder though, what the focus of flatpak is supposted to be
[04:51:45] <thurstylark> vendoring
[04:51:47] <thrice> I've never understand the big push for flatpak.  If anything, package management is one of hte strengths of linux
[04:52:10] <sheep> probably avoiding having to have different distros make their own packages
[04:52:11] <CodeSpelunker> thurstylark: how do you mean? Like packaging all dependencies?
[04:52:15] <thurstylark> yeah
[04:52:18] <CodeSpelunker> I see
[04:52:32] <thrice> sure, but don't build services mostly do that these days?
[04:52:58] <thrice> sure, some build-script upkeep
[04:53:06] <thurstylark> thrice: too much work to debug. instead, let's force my own environment :D
[04:53:20] <thurstylark> vendoring: WOMM as a service
[04:53:42] <CodeSpelunker> linux pkg management is nice, but not consistent among OSes I suppose
[04:53:55] <thrice> yeah, I'm being slightly obtuse; I DO see the positive potential
[04:54:27] <CodeSpelunker> no worries haha
[04:54:32] <thrice> but, it's just not good
[04:54:50] <CodeSpelunker> but, the isolation story does sound half-baked
[04:54:55] <CodeSpelunker> yeah
[04:54:56] <thurstylark> CodeSpelunker: well, this is the area where drawing the line between the Linux kernel and a Linux-based distro, because what you're calling "linux package management" is more in the linux distro camp
[04:55:12] <thurstylark> it's a bit pedantic, but actually useful to know
[04:55:30] * thrice runs linux on linux
[04:55:36] <CodeSpelunker> well, for the most part, pkg mgmt is split along distro lines though right?
[04:55:40] <thurstylark> yeah
[04:55:58] <CodeSpelunker> with the exception of debian-likes using deb, and RHEL likes using rpm
[04:56:07] <thrice> it's one of the only things that differ between distros (and, release cadence).  otherwise, distros are pretty similar these days

[16:09:11] <Namarrgon> mingdao gave you an example earlier
[16:09:23] <kib> but that was for a pastebin right?
[16:09:30] <thurstylark> I've learned not to assume these things, so don't get pissy about asking how you want things set up when you're in here asking how to set things up
[16:09:31] <Namarrgon> what do you want to do?
[16:09:47] <Namarrgon> copy from xfce-terminal to where?
[16:09:50] <mingdao> kib: I just want to throw this out as a reference for you https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki
[16:10:10] <kib> to my xorg clipboard so I can paste into other programs like firefox, libreoffice etc.
[16:10:22] <Namarrgon> iirc ctrl+shift+c/v
[16:10:31] <thurstylark> what happens now when you select text and copy it?

[16:11:02] <thurstylark> yeah, just read the tmux wiki
[16:11:14] <thurstylark> it's gonna have better info than us
[16:11:14] <Namarrgon> where do you run tmux if not in st or xfce4-terminal?
[16:11:26] <mingdao> kib: I like to highlight with my left mouse button, then paste with the scroll wheel.
[16:11:41] <grawity> I suppose they want to make tmux's built-in text buffer thing work with the X clipboard?
[16:11:49] <mingdao> kib: There are also ways to copy/paste with the kbd.
[16:11:50] *** Joins: tkkon (~tkkon@user/tkkon)
[16:12:14] <thurstylark> it totally depends on how tmux is configured
[16:12:27] <mingdao> ^^^
[16:12:31] <thurstylark> because it's compatible with the mouse to use with that paste buffer
[16:12:36] <kib> mingdao, when I select text in tmux, the moment I let go of my mouse selected text is imediately deselected. I have default tmux
[16:12:41] <mingdao> $HOME/.tmux.conf
[16:12:47] <thurstylark> so if you cargo-culted someone's tmux config, then it'll be in there
[16:12:57] <thurstylark> otherwise, there's a whole list of factors to consider
[16:13:03] <kib> thurstylark, I have not. I'd rather understand what I'm using before using it ;D
[16:13:08] <thurstylark> trust me, I've been down this road with tmux and paste buffers
[16:13:16] <thurstylark> kib: that's a good idea :P
[16:13:29] <kib> I guess I'll just launch a normal terminal when I need to copy paste. This stuff is beyond me rn ;P
[16:14:11] <thurstylark> there's just n+1 ways to skin that cat, so it totally depends on how you want it to act vs how you currently have it configured.
[16:14:12] <mingdao> kib: Also, not to run you off from here, because there are very knowledgable folks, but libera.chat has #tmux
[16:14:38] <thurstylark> ooh, yeah #tmux is probably a good place to ask as well
[16:14:52] <mingdao> kib: If you just lurk there, and record the channel for a reference later, in a month you'll have more information than you'll need.
[16:14:56] <kib> thanks I will check it out

[16:21:39] <grawity> in this case none, as there's only one page in section 1
[16:21:53] <kib> I thought man 1 was the same as man?
[16:22:06] <grawity> no, it looks through all sections in a specific order
[16:22:24] <grawity> /etc/man_db.conf says "1 1p n l 8 3 3p 0 0p 2 5 4 9 6 7"
[16:22:29] <mingdao> kib: `man man` ; `man 1 man` ; `man 7 man`
[16:22:38] <kib> so man tmux shows the whole man page of tmux but man 1 tmux shows only the first section?

[17:44:46] <Gagis> bootloaders are pretty simple to configure. just make sure your nvidia/radeon/whatever drivers are dkms or built for the zen kernel
[17:44:53] <thurstylark> I would make a new entry conf instead of editing your existing entry
[17:45:13] <kib> thurstylark, yes me too but they said they're going to migrate kernels
[17:45:17] <orangeboxcutter> do i have to run mkinitcpio
[17:45:20] <kib> i had 2 kernels
[17:45:36] <kib> orangeboxcutter, presumably no because it probably will be run after installation of kernel
[17:45:52] <kib> however I still would do a mkinitcpio -P to preven terrors

[19:21:30] <kib> obby, you'll need networkmanager for easy network setup
[19:21:48] <kib> install nm, enable nm , enjoy life
[19:22:02] <Daemonick> I had a network issue the last time I installed Arch in my desktop
[19:22:03] <thurstylark> networkmanager is one of many choices of network managers that are available on arch
[19:22:11] <GabCM> oh yeah when I first installed arch I spent some time figuring out how to get it online, and then I installed networkmanager and it was much easier
[19:22:34] *** Joins: FFY00 (~FFY00@archlinux/trusteduser/ffy00)
[19:22:34] <GabCM> even doing static IP is easier with nm
[19:22:40] <Daemonick> with the module u8169 if I am right. It is realtek.
[19:22:47] <thurstylark> you could also choose systemd-networkd which is already installed
[19:22:49] <obby> was hoping I could without having to reboot again to install more packages cuz Im lazy but ill just reboot and install one I suppose thurstylark
[19:23:11] <thurstylark> obby: systemd-networkd is pretty simple to set up for ethernet
[19:23:20] <thurstylark> !give obby aw systemd-networkd
[19:23:21] <phrik> obby: Systemd-networkd - https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Systemd-networkd
[19:23:24] <obby> thanks
[19:23:45] <thurstylark> it's included with systemd, but needs to be configured and started/enabled to be useful

[19:35:14] <GabCM> on my end it was on TV in a tech show as a kid
[19:35:24] <Daemonick> He told me to download ubuntu so to test my connection speed
[19:35:35] <GabCM> I mean young teen
[19:35:45] <Daemonick> That was in 2008
[19:35:58] <GabCM> yeah I think I first dabbled with Linux in around 2005-2008
[19:36:01] <Daemonick> maybe earlier
[19:36:04] <obby> I remember installing ubuntu when I was like 12
[19:36:12] <GabCM> yeah I was around 12 as well
[19:36:18] <GabCM> but for me it was Mandriva
[19:36:21] <obby> im 23 now
[19:36:27] <GabCM> 29 here
[19:36:46] <mator> slackware 3.0 ftw (1996)
[19:36:52] <Daemonick> 36 here
[19:37:14] <GabCM> actually back then I was impressed at Mandriva's full OS running off a USB pendrive and its window manager being fully 3D
[19:37:33] <GabCM> but meh 3D windows aren't that useful in the end
[19:38:05] <obby> anyone in here have good experience with the Nvidia drivers
[19:38:31] <GabCM> I've installed the proprietary nvidia drivers in both standard and zen kernels no problem
[19:38:58] <Daemonick> I was suprised of how an old DVD with Linux Ubuntu 13 was updated and loaded the new stuff via Internet like I had inserted the new version of it
[19:39:01] <obby> every time I've tried properly setting up the drivers with a 3000 series card on some kind of linux I can never get it working prproperly
[19:39:27] <GabCM> I dunno if card model does anything in this case but I have a 1080 Ti
[19:39:55] <obby> I think it does for sure I think the designs of the cards have changed quite a bit 
[19:40:00] <GabCM> true
[19:40:37] <obby> there is definitely a lot more knowledge and experience with the 1000 series too
[19:40:45] <GabCM> yeah
[19:41:00] <obby> I mine on like 20-30 cards but they all mine on windows because of it LMFAO
[19:41:25] <GabCM> I've simply followed the wiki for my 1080 ti. but then I had to install more packages like nvidia-dkms at least for the zen kernel
[19:41:48] <obby> what window manager do you use
[19:41:56] <GabCM> KWin, on KDE Plasma
[19:42:41] <obby> hmmm such a tough choice

[23:34:50] <mingdao> kib: First one use my res.
[23:34:52] <another|> kib: it happens regularly in #ffmpeg 
[23:35:14] <th0rne> My webcam doesn't seem to work. I need for teams. Teams doesn't have any testing settings, but I tried in discord, and it doesn't see it. I do see it in lsusb.
[23:35:33] <demonicmaniac> mingdao: just saying simplescreenrecorder is more like paint where obs is more like gimp
[23:35:35] <kib> mingdao, idk man it works for me ;D
[23:35:49] <demonicmaniac> if you don't need 99% of what obs brings to the table on top of recording/don't need it
[23:35:51] <kib> works for luke smith and literally every youtuber too ;D
[23:35:56] <mingdao> th0rne: I built teams a few weeks ago for an interview and had the same problem.  Just fired up the Windows 10 for pentesting and used it there.

[23:37:51] <th0rne> In lsusb, I see this: Bus 004 Device 003: ID 046d:086b Logitech, Inc. BRIO 4K Stream Edition

[23:38:20] <kib>  this is supposed to work perfectly but if it doesn't ( it's basically the same command you sent I think) do you even want to troubleshoot?
[23:38:27] <mingdao> th0rne: It might have been me, but I have since deleted everything from $HOME/software/teams

[23:39:17] <th0rne> Which it doesn't.

[23:39:45] <kib> I love google meet. It works well from withing the browser 👌👌

[23:41:38] <th0rne> Ok, I will.
[23:42:00] <thurstylark> huh, the two video devices didn't get a kernel module attached to them...
