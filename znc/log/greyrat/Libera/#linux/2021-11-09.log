[01:26:47] <AquaL1te> Dagmar: the reason behind it is to switch a system with guest users into a maintenance mode. so the allowlist which includes this users is then purged. but already logged in users can still roam on the system while it should be in maintenance mode. in the past this could be done with host.allow easily. but that has not really been depricated. so now i guess firewalls are better. admins and other users
[01:26:53] <AquaL1te> that still need to be able to login can still do that. the allowlist is a seperate firewall chain that can safely be cleared

[01:32:21] <Dagmar> Well, this would be it.
[01:33:07] <Dagmar> Block logging in of all non-special users (ssh config change and restart) then scan the process list looking at the uid, session id, and pid of everything.  If the pid matches the session id, it's a session leader.  If the process belongs to a non-special user, kill it.

[01:59:58] <Dagmar> The brower, unlike an xterm, is _going_ to eat a lot of CPU if you try to have it keep updating the rendered page while it resizes

[02:00:24] <Mion> cpu and gpu
[02:00:28] <Dagmar> I don't care which browser it is
[02:00:53] <Dagmar> A webpage layout typically involves a rather complex process of measuremnet and remeasurement

[03:16:21] <kveroneau> 6502 is much easier to learn imo, and the cc65 compiler kit is really well documented.
[03:16:25] <XJ8> 6502 is what powers the NES, it's extremely simple.

[04:10:16] <Shortsop> I can't connect to it via my iPad :/
[04:10:24] <ayecee> what happens when you try
[04:10:42] <Shortsop> I'm not sure if the ip they provided is correct in that guide aka 10.140.90.168, unless that's standard
[04:10:53] <ayecee> focus dude
[04:11:42] <Shortsop> it just spins 'LOADING' for 1 minute and says 'unknown error' or something I believe
[04:11:47] <ayecee> right now we're at the level of "i've tried EVERYTHING and NOTHING WORKS!!1!!!
[04:12:08] <ayecee> try it again so you know what the error is instead of guessing

[06:51:11] <Matt|home> i have plenty of ram but vmware _constantly_ crashes with memory issues on this desktop, i somehow managed to break qemu during installation once, and virtualbox just stopped working out of the blue one day and i never bothered figuring out why cuz it was so slow

[11:00:05] <RayTracer> katp32: huh, surprising
[11:00:20] <katp32> surprising indeed, I thought I was losing my mind lol
[11:01:59] <hexnewbie> That's one of the cases where I think like, either the antenna's not just an antenna, or it's shorting something critical, or there's an additional issue that aggravates the antenna one (which could be a watchdog forcing a reboot, such as some routers have)
[11:02:10] <RayTracer> katp32: I assume if you had other endpoints (laptop/amp/tft) to test, you would already have done so?
[11:02:37] <katp32> the antenna doesn't have any kind of embedded IC if that's what you mean, the wifi card works fine without it attached, just with a lot of packet loss

[11:08:50] <RayTracer> my amp has multiple inputs for one source (eg. spdif coax, spdif fibre, hdmi) but the "auto select" doesn't always do the right thing. However, that's probably unlikely the reason on your setup.
[11:09:53] <katp32> lacroix: I've tried playing directly to the device with `aplay` and `speaker-test` (ie with the -D option), as well as with JACK, no luck; also checked that the devices weren't muted (which it turns out they were, but unmuting them didn't help anyways)
[11:09:58] <Smeef> Aww, this is perfect, I just built a tiny cyberdeck and bsd-games would be amazing on it

[11:10:09] <katp32> tiny cyberdeck? pics?
[11:10:55] <katp32> RayTracer: yeah, not likely the issue here since there's a seperate device for each mini-DP port (plus an extra fifth device for unknown reasons)

[11:20:10] <katp32>  /etc/asound.conf only does two things, which is define PCMs and define the default PCM. the -D option on aplay and speaker-test ignores the default PCM (since that's what that option is for) and instead uses the PCM passed on the command line. when I say I'm playing directly to the device, I mean I'm using "hw:HDMI,7" (or whatever the device number is), which is a predefined PCM not created by the
[11:20:13] <katp32> ALSA configs (because there are multiple, /usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf is arguably more important as it defines a bunch of other default PCMs). so, no, it's not the asound.conf.

[12:10:08] <katp32> it was only recently that I realized that partition types mean basically nothing, you can format partitions with whatever kind of filesystem you want (even though some OSes might throw up if you do that)
[12:10:10] <Sauvin> I ain't running off to the garage and telling them I need the "main cylinder" worked on.
[12:10:36] <alkisg> Guest10: this means that your sdb1 and sdb2 are partitioned, but not formatted
[12:10:47] <alkisg> So without a file system, you can't mount it (and it doesn't have a UUID); you need to format them first
[12:10:48] <Sauvin> That's how I'm reading it, yeah.

[13:33:40] <hexnewbie> Hmm, dmraid is different from mdraid, md can be maximized to fill the device if needed, and one can query the data offset which also reduces the size. How does one do that with dmraid I don't know. Perhaps ‘dmsetup table’ can provide useful information

[14:01:50] <hexnewbie> Yeah, numerous advantages where 1 MiB of saved space won't do much good. One exception is when you need to grow the partition, when they become a big hassle (which is not a problem of partitions, but of fdisk/gdisk)
[14:02:33] <lericson> i don't see the advantage
[14:03:06] <hexnewbie> With a partition you get: metadata in terms of label, UUID (possibly signifying purpose), which would prevent Windows from wanting to overwrite it, ability for the LVM to exist with a /boot partition, or ESP or biosgrub partition (on some old machines with buggy BIOSes, one might need to add one to every disk)
[14:03:18] <lericson> ah
[14:03:20] <lericson> fair point

[14:11:27] <hexnewbie> lericson: It's one of the things that shouldn't usually be tuned, and when it is tuned it's got to be for a reason
[14:11:27] <lericson> in fact, should i use ext4 at all for this multiple-terabyte behemoth raid5 on lvm volume?
[14:11:46] <lericson> what about removing reserved blocks
[14:11:48] <XJ8> cornel https://superuser.com/questions/248078/choice-of-filesystem-for-gnu-linux-on-an-sd-card
[14:12:07] *** Joins: ko (~i.am@user/marlboro)
[14:12:12] <rascul> cornel the fs type doesn't really matter all that much in the end but you'll probably want to limit writes because sd cards don't tend to last long in my experience
[14:12:25] <xiaomiao> lericson: I'd not use raid5, if possible, but if you have to ext4 is a pretty ok choice
[14:12:33] <cornel> XJ8, thank you, i've seen that but not sure there's an actual answer there
[14:12:42] <lericson> xiaomiao: why that
[14:12:46] <xiaomiao> and reserved blocks are 5% by default, it should be safe to reduce that to, say, 1% with tunefs
[14:13:08] <XJ8> It recommended UBIFS cornel and discouraged ext4.
[14:13:26] <xiaomiao> lericson: the rebuild time on raid5 can be pretty brutal, and there might be undetected data corruption
[14:13:31] <hexnewbie> XJ8: It should be noted that ubifs, jffs2 (and I suspect yaffs2) are meant for MTD devices that *don't* do their own wear-levelling, like SD cards are *supposed* to
[14:13:44] <lericson> xiaomiao: i was choosing between raid0 or raid5
[14:13:59] <xiaomiao> oh then definitely raid5 :)
[14:14:04] <xiaomiao> but please have backups
[14:14:14] <XJ8> Then what do you recommend for an SD card for cornel hexnewbie?
[14:14:22] <lericson> otoh why would raid4 be better than raid5?
[14:14:44] <roflbot> lericson: what about raid6 instead of 5? a more disk for parity, but I sleep better.
[14:14:46] <lericson> xiaomiao: this raid set is for storing datasets which are downloaded from the 'net, so it should be ok
[14:15:03] <lericson> i'm slowly convincing myself that raid0 is maybe the way to go
[14:15:12] <xiaomiao> ah, if it's reproducable then raid0 is ok
[14:15:16] <lericson> roflbot: i only have 3 disks
[14:15:23] <xiaomiao> if you accept the risk of having to completely rebuild on any failure
[14:15:32] <lericson> i thought raid5 might save some time if disk failure does happen
[14:16:03] <cornel> rascul, XJ8 , hexnewbie thank you
[14:16:04] <roflbot> lericson: ahh.  if uptime is not a problem you could do daily snapshots with rsnapshop (rsync).
[14:16:06] <xiaomiao> yes that should allow for one disk failure without bigger impact, you'd just have to rebuild the missing drive
[14:16:13] <cornel> gotta check if fedora installer offers this option
[14:16:34] <cornel> do any of you know what is raspberryos using?
[14:16:35] <hexnewbie> XJ8, cornel: I don't see anything that would prefer one *normal* filesystem over the other. I do understand that f2fs (and nilfs) are intended for that purpose, further reducing the wear particularly if you don't trust the SD card firmware, but um, one needs to be advised that using a less common filesystems will come with surprises other people have not faced (ext4 won't).

[15:47:55] <XJ8> Alrighty then. Glad you got your issue sorted out. :D
[15:48:50] <ychaouche> tcdump has this nice feature where you can filter packets by tcp flags. tcp[13] is the 13 byte of the TCP packet, which contains the flags. So a value of 2 means SYN flag is set.
[15:49:10] <ychaouche> I only filter on SYN packets, b/c I'm not interested in the rest of the TCP discussion.

That's why I'm guessing the PXE boot code is not setting MSR 0x122 == 3 (which locks the CPU to 32-bit mode)
[17:50:07] <matthewcroughan_> There are a lot of laptops that are like this, and I think it'd be a nice addition, can anyone tell me why this is the wrong approach?

[21:19:50] <ayecee> can you add a subdirectory on the end?
[21:20:05] <SpeakerToMeat> Well I never got in too deep with NFS4 and it was ages ago, but my memory is you don't share just any directory and mount it anywhere willy nilly, you share a base, and you can mount subdirectories off that base in a certain place

[23:09:25] <PaulFertser> m-atoms: modern tendency is to merge / and /usr so any shell would end up in /bin too.
