[00:05:43] <rootkea> lotuspsychje: Done. https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/vlc/+bug/1939447
[00:05:45] <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1939447 in vlc (Ubuntu) "Audio plays but no video in vlc" [Undecided, New]
[00:06:53] <lotuspsychje> thank you for your report rootkea
[00:08:42] <ioria> rootkea, have you tried to disable Hardware acceleration in vlc ?
[00:08:50] <coconut> audiocat, normally you just want the latest LTS
[00:10:51] <coconut> audiocat, https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/ubuntu-20.04.2-live-server-amd64.iso.torrent
[00:10:53] <coconut> or
[00:10:56] <coconut> https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/ubuntu-20.04.2-live-server-amd64.iso
[00:12:59] <lotuspsychje> rootkea: also add to the bug you tested a new user, tnx
[00:13:47] <rootkea> ioria: Since the issue is with hardware accelerator ("hardware accelerator failed to decode picture") disabling hardware acceleration does show the video.
[00:13:47] <rootkea> But I would like to use the hardware acceleration. The way it was already being used till today's afternoon when I upgraded the packages.
[00:14:33] <ioria> rootkea, what packages ?
[00:15:24] <rootkea> I don't remember exactly. Is there any way to see the history of `apt upgrade`?
[00:15:32] <lotuspsychje> dpkg logs
[00:15:42] <ioria> 7var/log/apt/history.log rootkea
[00:15:50] <rootkea> Thanks! Let me check.

[00:24:19] <lotuspsychje> something for the devs to workout, above my knowledge rootkea
[00:24:38] <lotuspsychje> rootkea: at least you been able to rule out a lot of things right
[00:25:52] <rootkea> lotuspsychje: Sure. How can I rollback these mesa driver packages? That is, to install previous versions
[00:26:51] <rootkea> That will surely help zeroing on the exact package.
[00:26:59] <lotuspsychje> well downgrading packages is not how ubuntu works exactly
[00:27:13] <lotuspsychje> could be interesting to browse recent mesa bugs then

[03:06:16] <JumpinJimmy> Can anyone help me? I'm having trouble getting Ubuntu to load from DVD.
[03:06:44] <sarnold> an actual dvd?
[03:07:06] <JumpinJimmy> yes, burned DVD
[03:07:07] <JumpinJimmy> DVD is properly burned, but on restart, it says it cannot boot from this device.
[03:07:39] <JumpinJimmy> i've gone through this link, but still having no luck  https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/try-ubuntu-before-you-install#2-boot-from-dvd

[03:09:46] <ubottu> UEFI is a specification that defines a software interface between an operating system and platform firmware. It is meant as a replacement for the BIOS. For information on how to set up and install Ubuntu and its derivatives on UEFI machines please read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI
[03:09:57] <JumpinJimmy> it will let me manually crawl through the directories on the CD to find the boot file, but won't boot.

[03:18:38] <tomreyn> JumpinJimmy: so my suggestion was just about 'trying something else' really.
[03:19:08] <tomreyn> just because it can sometimes be faster than getting to the bottom of it
[03:19:11] <JumpinJimmy> ok. I'll try to find a USB stick, and try it there.
[03:19:28] <JumpinJimmy> if it does boot normally, what does that mean for my laptop?

[04:06:20] <Billy> a distro i mean
[04:06:49] <oerheks> maybe a 18.04 iso..
[04:06:53] <LjL> i'd default to Debian but that might just be because i default to Debian
[04:07:39] <Billy> I personally default to slackware but i alreayd have a good slacktop setup

[04:08:13] <oerheks> put android on it?
[04:08:14] <sarnold> is lubuntu 18.04 still supported? that might be a good starting point for an older machine
[04:08:36] <Billy> lubuntu was on the table too
[04:08:39] <Billy> in my mind
[04:09:31] <oerheks> lubuntu gives 3 year support?
[04:09:38] <oerheks> not 5 like ubuntu/gnome
[04:11:00] <sarnold> but if you never do anything other than firefox to get to amazon prime video it might be okay
[04:11:12] <sarnold> I'm not really a desktop person so I don't know what exactly you'd be missing out on
[04:11:28] <Billy> like i said it was given to me

[06:20:34] <CanisElSaviore> @tomreyn, It isn't my primary disk thogh.  That is an SSD.  It's one of my Hdd's.  I have been having this issue for years.  It might just be some idiosyncratic factory thing though. I have 2 that are suppose to be idential, but only one spins, and sounds as if it's being accessed constantly, while the other acts like it is supposed to.
[06:21:29] <tomreyn> maybe give them both a smartctl run
[06:21:31] <XV8> Are PPAs something the developer hosts or is it something that is ubuntu/canonical specific?

[06:21:36] <ubottu> CanisElSaviore: smart is Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology, a monitoring system for hard drives. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Smartmontools
[06:21:41] <CanisElSaviore> Using some FF workarounds I got it to stop spinning constantly.  But I can't see what is accessing the disk in linux.
[06:21:55] <CanisElSaviore> It's telling me that nothing is, though I can hear it.

[15:15:17] <matsaman> oh okay
[15:15:25] <matsaman> you probably need to run 'deactivate' a couple times
[15:15:28] <matsaman> till your prompt is 100% normal
[15:15:39] <matsaman> and then source path/to/venv/bin/activate _once_ for the right path
[15:16:01] <matsaman> if you're not sure which is right, then just start from scratch again: python3 -m venv new/venv/path; source new/venv/path/bin/activate

[20:07:50] <nick7465> Hello! I am running 20.04.2 and am having a bit of difficulty with the nvidia drivers. I tried from both the software updater GUI and terminal to install/update the latest driver from nvidia (470) but am receiving "unmet dependencies" and "you have held broken packages" errors.
[20:08:07] <nick7465> I ran dpkg --get selections | grep hold and it doesn't show anything so I'm sure it's only the unmet dependencies
[20:08:19] <nick7465> How can I figure out how to fix this?
[20:09:03] <nick7465> the dependencies listed are all nvidia-based, so I'm confused as to why it doesn't just pull them as part of the install

[20:59:35] <amcsi> I seemed to have broken my ubuntu install by starting my dual-booted windows and shutting down before it started to boot. While trying to set up grub again on my ubuntu (which is on a different SSD than my windows), I seemed to have trouble setting up GRUB+EFI for my ubuntu. Based on searching around on the internet, I think the source of the problem may be that there's no EFI partition on my ubuntu SSD. When listing the partitions, I saw
[20:59:35] <amcsi> that there were only the / partition, the /home partition, and swap. Assuming nothing outright removed any other partition, and that there needs to be an efi partition to install an efi bootloader, then might the only explanation be that my EFI partition was on my Windows drive all along? Because I do see an EFI System partition there. Also I believe I installed Windows first
[21:00:22] <ioria> nick7465,  sudo apt purge inux-modules-nvidia-440-5.4.0-42-generic inux-modules-nvidia-440-5.4.0-47-generic
[21:00:26] <Walex> amcsi: there must be only one EFI partition.

[21:01:26] <Walex> amcsi: unless you do really weird things like switching the "primary" drive in the BIOS before booting.
[21:01:28] <nick7465> hehe figured that one, no problem! I ran it with the missing l's and it removed both
[21:01:29] <amcsi> Walex, oh, I mounted /sdb2 (the windows drive's EFI partition), and in there I see an EFI/ubuntu
[21:01:59] <ioria> nick7465,  sudo apt purge libnvidia-compute-460
[21:02:01] <Walex> amcsi: amcsi: the way Ubuntu boots with EFI is slightly weird, so don't look into that.

[21:42:54] <Walex> amcsi: the boot then proceeds like this: the BIOS boots EFI, EFI mounts th EFI partition, scans it and finds the MS-Windows bootloader and the GRUB2 bootloader, and then gives you a menu. When you select GRUB2 it mounts '/boot' as its root partition and there it goes.

[22:09:41] <TheFork> sakura, another option that I didn't really consider, but AWS/GCP/Azure should have blob storage with an encryption option where you store the keys within the cloud service itself.  It's maybe like .02 per gb plus nominal fee for transfers + key usage.
[22:10:02] <Walex> nick4765: on a really weak GPU on my laptop I get 37FPS and 6% load. The important thing is that the load should not exceed single digits.

[22:13:26] <Walex> nick4765: it is good, I wonder why the FPS is low here too.
[22:14:13] <sakura> TheFork thanks for the answers, I just didnt want to expose my passphrase on the terminal, which can be logged by the admin, just thought a little more about it and decided to create a new passwordless key just to encrypt these files, but I'm open for better ideas.
[22:14:38] <TheFork> I mean that's probably a pretty good option overall
[22:15:30] <Walex> nick4765: I just started Steram and it looks like Valheim is native Linux
[22:16:13] <nick4765> Walex so in theory I could launch it without OpenGL? Or I could launch it without proton? I think I have proton set to only be used if it NEEDS to be used, so I would think in the case of Valheim it wouldn't use proton?

[22:18:55] <TheFork> So long as server is well patched etc.  If it's like major corporation, then you'd typically do key vaults and key checkouts, but think for most use cases, especially personal use, it's probably overkill.  Yeah, definitely don't put the password plain text on a cronjob.  That's definitely not koshure.  All you need is someone to read off the file
[22:18:55] <TheFork> or check history and boom.  It's all compromised.

[22:34:26] <nick4765> That is good news!
[22:34:55] <TJ-> nick4765: your Xorg log file suggested that but this confirms it; so what happens is Xorg and the GPU driver offer a set of 'standard' resolutions
[22:35:10] <TJ-> nick4765: it points to the source of your problem - no EDID
[22:35:46] <nick4765> Which I think is some type of marking that let's the driver interpret what monitor is present? So it has no idea what the monitor is, so it can't suggest a good reso?

[23:19:42] <oerheks> newer.. we surely backport bugfixes

[23:21:12] <cornfeedhobo> okay, *way* is an exaggeration, buuuuut, the fact that the api subcommand is missing is frustrating :p

[23:27:40] <leftyfb> cornfeedhobo: ubuntu is not a rolling release
[23:27:48] <cornfeedhobo> neither is LEAP
[23:28:08] <cornfeedhobo> but again, it gets it done
[23:28:14] <leftyfb> cornfeedhobo: then use that

[23:34:08] <superboot> I've got an old install I'm migrating of Ubuntu 14.04 server. When I run /etc/init.d/mysql stop, it says it shuts down, and the logs confirm it too, but it starts right back up. What is the correct way to shut it down and have it stay down?
