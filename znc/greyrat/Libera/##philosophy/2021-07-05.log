[02:29:57] <lalia> Especially like... at the grocery store.
[02:30:20] <evolv> right, because TACTILE FEEDBACK IS SUPERIOR
[02:30:51] <evolv> except if it's a keyboard for a phone, they keys are too small to make a difference, I do like the swipe feature for writing

[02:34:42] <evolv> and acts as a screen shield
[02:35:00] <evolv> large enough to be decently functional, small enough to make more errors

[02:46:32] <evolv> that's what I'm looking for
[02:46:50] <lalia> I'm interested in all of it, including the lesser known treatments of skepticism, but mostly would like to contribute to scholarship on ancient skepticism as related to Indian philosophies and Hellenistic accounts.
[02:47:15] <lalia> So that's what I'm focused on, I guess. :)
[02:48:24] <evolv> skepticism is epistemic or it only is applied to skepticism against epistemic positions?
[02:48:33] <evolv> or both?
[02:48:38] *** Quits: econo (uid147250@user/econo) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[02:49:04] <evolv> Indian philosophies wrt Vedic?
[02:49:16] <evolv> orthodox Vedic? Or heterodox, too?
[02:49:48] <lalia> Yeah, that's one of the sources. There are a few others, but I'm still not good at remembering titles.
[02:50:47] <evolv> this isn't skepticism as much as outright refutations of positions held by those of orthodox Vedic traditions, but if you haven't read it already, read this Sutta: https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/DN/DN01.html
[02:50:47] <ro-bot-o> [url] DN 1 Brahmajāla Sutta | The Brahmā Net | www.dhammatalks.org
[02:51:52] <evolv> it is the defining Sutta that distinguishes Buddhism from the prevailing theories at the time
[02:52:39] <lalia> evolv: epistemic skepticism is probably the most common angle taken to understanding skepticism as a philosophical project, but it doesn't have to be understood as exclusively within the province of epistemology. It's mostly the fact that contemporary accounts of skepticism commonly turn on some part of the knowledge narrative.
[02:52:49] <lalia> We have people like Descartes to thank for that.
[02:53:10] <lalia> I would go on to argue this characterization is based on a variety of terrible readings of the ancient traditions.
[02:53:26] <evolv> wouldn't poststructuralists entirely fall within the skepticism camp?
[02:53:41] <lalia> Descartes didn't care tho, he was looking for an ideal strawman in the first place. :P
[02:54:21] <lalia> evolv: I don't think so? But that depends on what you'd take as being skepticm versus nihilism or something like absurdism.
[02:54:37] <hovercat> lalia: ty I will check it out
[02:54:54] <lalia> :)
[02:57:21] <evolv> lalia, nihilism may be an outcome of poststructuralist thought, though, right? Poststructuralist focus, I thought, were arguments made on the nature of language and utility in communicating knowledge
[02:57:31] <evolv> and it's power in limiting knowledge
[02:59:54] <hovercat> lalia: great write. It conveyed much to me. You clearly put your work in.
[03:00:04] <hovercat> great write-up*
[03:00:16] <lalia> My understanding of post-structuralism has it that there's little to no coherence between the disperate stances and as such the term does little more than indicate a thinker who's recognized as responding critically to strucutralism, evolv.
[03:00:27] <lalia> hovercat: I appreciate that. :)
[03:00:31] <lalia> TY
[03:01:18] <hovercat> I particularly took in the point about ancient skepticism having no ambition to an argument, by definitiion.

[18:45:10] <lalia> Good morning. :)
[18:45:25] <lalia> How're y'all today?
[18:45:28] <pussipupu> Good afternoon
[18:49:26] <lalia> o/
[18:50:35] <pussipupu> Oh I remember what I wanted to ask you lalia, do you do any computer programming at all?
[18:50:54] <pussipupu> Just wondering if you use any interesting logic systems within
[18:56:05] <lalia> Not really, though I've dabbled some. I probably know more about the standard logical systems than about programming languages. :'D
[18:57:05] <pussipupu> Fair, just wondered because it's an interesting intersection
[18:57:25] <lalia> pussipupu: The best I ever got with programming is learning enough JavaScript to build decent website automation years ago before they redistributed most of that work to HTML and CSS.
[18:57:31] <pussipupu> I know a little about both, but I know slightly more than the average lay person about a fuckload of things
[18:57:40] <lalia> So now I forget most/all of it. :P
[18:58:10] <pussipupu> Oh, you'd like my web rant would you?
[18:58:10] <lalia> Python seems like it'd be handy for me, so I've touched it a few times.
[18:58:21] <lalia> But never realy got too far with it.
[18:58:32] <pussipupu> There shouldn't be three languages and it shouldn't be those three :p
[18:58:53] *** Joins: Metamorphosis (uid451146@user/metamorphosis)
[18:59:04] <lalia> :D
[18:59:15] <pussipupu> I mostly stay within Lisps, and don't do much at all these days, Python annoys me at least partially irrationally
[18:59:55] <lalia> I'm sure if I'd invested more early on Lisp/Scheme type languages would have my attention most.
[19:00:33] <pussipupu> To me, they're among the closest to the essence of computing
[19:00:42] <lalia> That family of languages has been the favorite of most of my programming friends for around 20 years now.
[19:00:44] <lalia> :D
[19:01:09] <TechTest> the only programming language I actually know is probably the most useless one
[19:01:11] <pussipupu> And I like the regulatory and simplicity of syntax
[19:01:20] <TechTest> ..MIPS Assembly
[19:01:32] *** Joins: aototot (~teteetett@92.114.82.82)
[19:01:34] <pussipupu> Intercalc?
[19:01:36] <pussipupu> ah, or that
[19:01:59] <lalia> The majority of them work with Java or some version of .net
[19:02:16] <lalia> No love for either tho.
[19:02:29] <lalia> All I hear are complaints. :D
[19:02:51] <pussipupu> oh god not Java
[19:02:57] <TechTest> what's Intercalc?
[19:03:26] <pussipupu> .net has at least one fairly reasonable language, f-sharp is an ocaml dialect
[19:04:31] <pussipupu> Intercal is a deliberately terrible programming language
[19:04:39] <pussipupu> intercalc is a typo :p
[19:05:04] <lalia> Math languages seem like neat/useful inventions. I'll probably wind up back with Python if I need to code anything tho. Just for the sake of convenience really. I'm too simple to figure out much more. :D LOL
[19:05:42] <pussipupu> You won't find simpler than me, which is why I stick with Lisp
[19:05:55] <pussipupu> (mostly scheme)
[19:06:00] <TechTest> doubt it's worse than MIPS
[19:06:24] <TechTest> actually I don't think MIPS is used anywhere, but that's the only one I know
[19:07:40] <pussipupu> looks like it's still used in routers at least
[19:07:54] <pussipupu> I never get that close to the metal though
[19:09:13] <pussipupu> When I Am Emperor, we'll move to a three or four day work week, and encourage and fund people to do HE and specifically encourage them to defocus

[19:11:42] <lalia> pussipupu: I've tried setting up a version of Lisp and got absurdly confused. :D
[19:11:45] <pussipupu> I need whisky
[19:11:46] <lalia> Never got it to work at all.
[19:12:15] <lalia> Python set itself up pretty painlessly. :'S
[19:12:37] <dartmouthed> pussipupu, Irish syncretism solved those two problems :P
[19:12:42] <lalia> I'd use other options if I were less thick. :D
[19:12:51] <pussipupu> Nah, that's whiskey
[19:12:55] <pussipupu> :p
[19:13:19] <lalia> I love a good whiskey. :) High West is probably the best here.
[19:13:36] <lalia> Anything else would need to be imported.
[19:15:17] <pussipupu> I'm not even sure how to get stuff that's not sold by the government monopoly here
[19:15:32] <pussipupu> but they sell stuff I like so...
[19:17:50] <lalia> Utah has state-run alcohol stores, but we manage to get decent imports still. Also, Utahns are fine with driving across boarders to stock up. :D
[19:18:06] <lalia> Me included. I'll drive to Wyoming or Nevada: they're not that far.
[19:18:36] <pussipupu> the borders I could drive over are a bit far
[19:18:53] <pussipupu> though I've taken the ferry to Estonia for cheap booze before
[19:19:14] <pussipupu> (and to see Tallinn, well worth the trip)
[19:21:25] <lalia> :3
[19:22:13] <pussipupu> Might drive over the Russian border too sometime, bit of an adventure

[22:19:46] <evolv> lalia, I'd like to join the skepticism group, but I just don't have the time to dedicate right now
[22:19:54] <evolv> it would be fun
[22:20:40] <lalia> The earliest we'd get started is mid-august. :) The plan ATM is to reengage reading groups through discussing Plato's Euthydemus.
[22:21:51] <lalia> I already have that group on hiatus and quite a few folks from that crowd are excited to get started again.
[22:25:43] <lalia> evolv: you'd be welcome to participate even without being able to get to the readings. I'm happy to invite folks who may not have a lot of time for extra reading as long as the people who do manage the readings are offered priority in terms of contributing to discussion. :)
[22:26:45] <lalia> We have quite a few folks who lurk or who have questions and whatnot without being able to get to the readings. Hasn't been a problem yet.
[22:27:24] <evolv> lalia, I'll mull it over. I get maybe an hour, of free internet time a day during a week, maybe two depending on conditions
[22:27:39] <evolv> ugh, comma splice
[22:28:02] <lalia> No worries. :) We'll be around if you wanna give it a shot.
[22:28:31] <pussipupu> I'd be interested in the scepticism reading group
[22:28:45] <evolv> I'm a little fried right now and gonna drink some sencha, but I'll know whether I want to sit in, at least, by tomorrow, lalia
[22:29:02] <evolv> lalia, is it text or voice?
[22:29:31] <evolv> voice is a no-go unless I want to stay holed up in the bedroom
[22:29:43] <evolv> my office is there, so I want to be freeeeee
[22:29:43] <lalia> Both. :) We have dedicated text channels for discussion whenever and we meet once a week to discuss.
[22:29:56] <lalia> Meetings are obviously optional.
[22:30:10] <lalia> I like offering a breadth of opportunities to engage.
[22:30:26] <pussipupu> I'd be interested in the tech channels :þ
[22:30:41] <pussipupu> Group voice isn't something I can generally bear

[22:31:37] <evolv> lalia, if you ever do a structuralism to poststructuralism discussion, sometime in the future, I'd figure out timing

[22:31:49] <evolv> like next year when I have a grip on this new job
[22:31:58] <evolv> or know for a fact I do not have a grip :P
[22:32:16] <lalia> evolv: I'd suggest checking in on the reading group schedule posted to TPC on Discord.
[22:32:19] <pussipupu> I have enough trouble with group voice in meatspace...
[22:32:27] <evolv> lalia, TPC?
[22:32:28] <lalia> They've probably got some readings in line with what you're looking for.
[22:32:38] <lalia> That Discord server I linked you to. :)
[22:32:49] <evolv> hmm, I missed it
[22:32:51] <evolv> let me scroll up
[22:33:11] <pussipupu> Oh, that reminds me, my favourite episode of hotel bar sessios so far is the one where they talked about grading and things

[22:35:16] <lalia> She's brilliant.
[22:37:27] <pussipupu> Honestly it's one of those podcasts that makes me want to be there

[22:41:49] <lalia> Ha! That's the idea, I think. :D

[22:44:41] <pussipupu> Ot
[22:45:14] <pussipupu> It's definitely a compliment, and I think that an important part of philosophy, and conversation in general, is coming to terms
[22:45:35] <pussipupu> And get angry at people dismissing coming to terms as “arguing semantics” like that's a bad thing :þ
[22:48:26] <lalia> Shannon's description of the show was something like conveying a setting where tired professionals are unwinding and idly jabbering about contextually relevant topics. She's always loved being able to grab drinks with other scholars while ambling through mutual philosophical interests and figured it might make for a good podcast. :D
[22:49:05] <lalia> Only Shan is rarely ever "tired" and you can witness this in the show. :P
[22:49:15] <lalia> She's a very lively person.
