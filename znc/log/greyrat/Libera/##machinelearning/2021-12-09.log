[04:26:56] <cheeseee> rom1504, looking to recommend products to customers based on the idea that items bought together on the same invoice, usually go together 
[04:27:52] <cheeseee> This is for manufacturing not retail, so most of the time when a customer buys a widget with an orifice of 5inches, hes going to buy a hose that goes into that widget with a width of 5 inches 
[04:28:27] <rom1504> what about svd?
[04:28:34] <rom1504> item-item svd on pmi
[04:28:52] <rom1504> pmi of co-counts of purchased products
[04:28:58] <rom1504> do you have enough data?
[04:29:11] <cheeseee> I am not familiar with the above terms
[04:29:34] <cheeseee> But yes we do hava historical data, 5years minimum of invoices, can go up to 20 if really needed
[04:30:00] <cheeseee> about 50,000 invoices/yr

[04:33:47] <rom1504> it can't work at scale
[04:33:58] <rom1504> I'm not very familiar with recommendation at very low scale
[04:33:59] *** Quits: Capricious (~capriciou@121.44.237.92) (Quit: Capricious)
[04:34:15] <rom1504> so maybe that apriori method is the right thing for you
[04:35:34] <cheeseee> I am not sure either, just getting started on this. Will check out the articles you linked 
[04:35:35] <rom1504> but I doubt you will get results that will be much different from pmi + svd
[04:35:56] *** Joins: Capricious (~capriciou@121.44.237.92)
[04:35:59] <rom1504> pmi + svd is a pretty classical way and it usually gets you pretty far
[04:36:42] <rom1504> that said, I'm used to scales of billion of products and billion of events
[04:36:59] <rom1504> not sure what works at 50k events scale
[04:37:07] <rom1504> or even if anything works at all
[04:37:18] <rom1504> maybe the best way is simply to annotate your data
[04:37:31] <rom1504> look at it manually I mean
[04:38:14] <cheeseee> Yeah its a niche industry, there arent that many events, were talking some supplies but mostly big equipment and machinery 
[04:38:49] <rom1504> ok I have an idea
[04:39:11] <rom1504> any chance that the mapping between your items is specified in the product descriptions ?
[04:39:38] <rom1504> if yes, maybe you could use something like https://www.sbert.net/ to find matchings
[04:39:39] <TitlesBot> 03⤷ SentenceTransformers Documentation — Sentence-Transformers documentation
[04:39:49] <rom1504> do you even have product descriptions ?
[04:40:07] <rom1504> how many products are we talking about anyway ?
[04:40:20] <cheeseee> I wish. Basically they want me to somehow reverse engineer what product managers should have been doing 
[04:40:30] <rom1504> if you have 50k events, how many products is that about ?
[04:40:36] <rom1504> like 200 ?
[04:40:38] <cheeseee> 52k products, only 14k have sold in the past 5 years 
[04:40:41] <cheeseee> unique sold 
[04:40:51] <rom1504> ok
[04:41:03] <rom1504> I would start by computing co-occurences
[04:41:33] <rom1504> like for each product, how many times they appear along with another product in an invoice
[04:41:40] <rom1504> then you rank by that number
[04:41:56] <rom1504> I bet you will find that you have a few pairs of items with high co-occurences
[04:42:03] <rom1504> like maybe 100 pairs
[04:42:09] <rom1504> and the rest you have no data
[04:42:17] *** Quits: Andrynet (~Andrynet@181.113.97.27) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[04:42:39] <cheeseee> I would assume so , sales team doesnt cross sell because they dont know what products go together with eachother :/ 
[04:42:43] <rom1504> the actual distribution should tell you if there is any hope to figure out things from this invoice data
[04:43:58] <rom1504> if there is really almost no co-occurences then you'd need to figure out something else
[04:44:04] <cheeseee> Ok so that part is easy, and have done it before. I was mostly interested in what you said earlier about mappings between products 
[04:44:30] *** Joins: Andrynet (~Andrynet@181.113.97.27)
[04:44:31] <cheeseee> What if I somehow augmented this data. Even though it doesnt exist, I can create a mapping based on product categories 
[04:44:59] <cheeseee> Example: Blue Aluminum Pipe goes with Red Aluminum Pipe 
[04:45:59] <rom1504> so what I called pmi + svd is not far from that, pmi is just cocount(x,y) / (count(x)*count(y)) and svd is just about decomposing that matrix so you get item embedding which then give you an item-item mapping
[04:46:17] <rom1504> (that = the co-count idea)
[04:46:26] <rom1504> yes
[04:46:35] <rom1504> if you have content data, I definitely advise using that
[04:46:45] <rom1504> categories, any text, even images
[04:47:11] <cheeseee> I will have to investigate this further. We are talking here about extracting data from a legacy ERP system that was built before the internet was a thing 
[04:47:32] <rom1504> if you have that you can use https://www.sbert.net/ or for example https://github.com/openai/CLIP to do image/text matching

[04:47:32] <TitlesBot> 03⤷ GitHub - openai/CLIP: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining
[04:47:48] <rom1504> but you'd need to first check if there is actual useful information in the data
[04:48:07] <rom1504> ml doesn't do magic, if there is no info it won't do anything
[04:48:25] <rom1504> ok yeah
[04:49:01] <rom1504> hmm
[04:49:06] <rom1504> here's another idea
[04:49:17] <rom1504> you can use your invoice data to find what are the top products
[04:49:35] <rom1504> if you find that 95% of the sales are only like 100 products
[04:49:52] <rom1504> maybe you just want to manually build mapping for these 100 products
[04:50:11] <rom1504> and for all the other products, maybe it doesn't matter too much if you don't know anything
[04:50:58] <cheeseee> Thats a good idea 
[04:51:01] *** Quits: ua_ (~ua@public-gprs219161.centertel.pl) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[04:51:27] <cheeseee> I know they have a list of about 100-200 high performing items  
[04:51:58] <rom1504> I guess specialist will know what people buy along with these items
[04:52:36] <cheeseee> heh, thats what I told them...  
[04:52:36] <rom1504> that approach clearly doesn't scale to many products, but at least you'll get a feeling for the data, and you'll know that you have at least something that works
[04:52:55] <cheeseee> Have the product specialists build this out, and then I can use that data for product recommendations 
[04:53:42] <cheeseee> But since the work hasnt been done in the past, its hard to quickly put the specialists to that task, we are talking 70 years worth of history here 
[04:54:08] <rom1504> ok, and is it really non intuitive ?
[04:54:21] <rom1504> like if you look at the products you can't figure out what it would go with ?
[04:54:47] <rom1504> maybe you just spend an hour and do it yourself I mean :)
[04:54:58] *** Quits: Andrynet (~Andrynet@181.113.97.27) (Quit: WeeChat 3.3)
[04:56:51] <rom1504> I need to go but anyway I guess my big advise on this is: there's nothing magical about product recommendation. All the big (and small) companies reinvent various heuristics and algorithms and combine them in various ways. It kind of works but also it's *very* far from working well
[04:57:25] <cheeseee> I mean, to me it wouldn't be non-intuitive. A lot of these products go on pipelines or assembly lines, so the relationship between two products could be based on them being adjacent to eachother  or really far apart 
[04:57:46] <cheeseee> I see, have a good night, thanks for the info 
[04:58:25] <rom1504> yeah that "go together in pipelines/assembly lines" seems like a good idea
[04:58:42] <rom1504> maybe you could collect data on that
[04:59:16] <rom1504> who knows maybe there is even existing doc on these assembly lines and they mention products...
[04:59:22] <rom1504> good night
