Say Z_j = k^(2), the exponent denoting the iteration level and suppose we have a convergent Taylor series f(z) = sum_m c_m z^m.

[10:39:08] <causative_> yes, 16, you go left to right.  Although in that case I might suspect someone made a typo

[10:39:54] <Fangs> causative_: how do you bind the division?
[10:40:08] <Fangs> is there a convention on how to intepret expressions like that?
[10:40:17] <pikapika> ...I thought I was in ##programming
[10:40:37] <causative_> usually when you write multiplication adjacent like that, 2(2+2), it means it the 2 is multiplied by the (2+2)
[10:40:42] <pikapika> But while writing mathematical expressions on paper, usually suck kinds of disambiguating parentheses are not needed due to the vertical factor
[10:41:07] <Fangs> causative_: the division, is it 8/(junk) or (8/2)*junk?
[10:41:10] <pikapika> ie you would right rational terms in a vertical manner, and then include smaller sized division bars for the numerator or denominator etc
[10:41:22] <pikapika> for the most extreme example, see continued fractions

[16:09:42] <OverCoder> Hmmm
[16:10:31] <nejimban> is it about *linear* differential equations?
[16:10:49] <OverCoder> no just homogeneous in general

[19:19:15] <JaredCE> lisp123: so 50% + 100% + 60% would be x% out of 100%?  so not adding to 210
[19:19:38] <JaredCE> it is simple, i'm just terrible with math

[19:21:04] <cadmio> I couldn't determine yet how many elements H has, if I multiply the generator by itself I keep getting different matrices
[19:21:09] <lisp123> So you want to rescale 50, 100, 60 so that when you add the percentages, you get 100%? And want to find out the factor for this?
[19:21:46] <JaredCE> i think so
[19:22:06] <lisp123> I think it is 100/210
[19:22:58] <lisp123> so 50 becomes 23.8, 100 becomes 47.6 and 60 becomes 28.5

[19:23:39] <JaredCE> i thought it would be that, but wasn't 100% (:D) sure

[21:11:07] <sedeki> hmm.. well, since the sequence is monotone increasing, you obviously have a (total) ordering, namely the subset relation...
[21:12:08] <sedeki> the supremum would refer to X (in the above)
[21:13:47] <int-e> there's a concept of an ω-complete partial order; that's a partial order where every monotonically increasing sequence has a supremum.
[21:14:31] <sedeki> i think you're right, thanks. i took a closer look in my old book which uses strange notation. it's simply \sup. also denoted in some literature by an uparrow, right?

[22:06:15] <Z-module> Hm, how had I never heard of this result before? (from 1972)  Every infinite ring (can be non-commutative) has a commutative infinite subring.
[22:06:33] <Franciman> Z-module: it is obvious
[22:06:45] <Franciman> nobody expected it
[22:06:56] <Franciman> actually
[22:07:55] <riv> it is surprising
[22:08:00] <riv> is it difficult?
[22:08:51] <riv> what about something like F_2^bar
[22:09:09] <riv> I guess the commutative subring doesn't necessarily contain 1
[22:09:21] <riv> well bad example because that's commutative
[22:09:32] <Z-module> The original proof (not sure if there's been simplification since then) depends on a thing of Herstein's.   https://londmathsoc-onlinelibrary-wiley-com.libproxy.mit.edu/doi/epdf/10.1112/blms/4.1.3
