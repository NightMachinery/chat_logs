[01:03:51] <no_gravity> Is it safe to do this? foreach($items as $key=>$item) { if(someCondition()) unset($items[$key]; }
[01:04:34] <Blondie101010> "safe" is a misleading term, but sure you can do that
[01:06:05] <no_gravity> I wonder if it will make the loop go bonkas.
[01:06:12] <__adrian> it would not
[01:06:18] <no_gravity> That is good.
[01:06:40] <no_gravity> So PHP makes a copy of the keys upon entering the loop?
[01:06:42] <__adrian> at least, not with arrays, or any well-designed iterator
[01:07:03] <no_gravity> __adrian: Yeah, it is an array.
[01:07:15] <__adrian> for arrays, yes, it iterates the items as-they-were when iteration started
[01:08:12] <no_gravity> Nice. Sounds a bit memory intensive, but the right thing for my use case.
[01:08:24] <__adrian> it's not quite like that  :)
[01:09:11] <__adrian> more like the copy-on-write mechanism. but i couldn't testify as t the internals.
[01:10:28] <no_gravity> I see.
[01:10:30] <Blondie101010> only the cursor changes
[01:12:37] <no_gravity> Funky, the whole array seems to be copied: https://3v4l.org/YB6Ho
[01:13:05] <Blondie101010> not sure I follow your logic
[01:13:26] <no_gravity> It iterates over elements that have already been unset.
[01:13:30] <Blondie101010> ahhhh
[01:13:46] <Blondie101010> just like anything else that gets passed by value

[03:59:16] <sine> Im trying to work with currency/money but not for transactions just working out. 11.23 is fine but 11.20 shows at 11.2
[03:59:31] <entuland> nver use floats for currency
[03:59:39] <entuland> like, ever
[03:59:58] <entuland> use integers multiplying by the precision factor you want
[04:00:43] <entuland> if you want to work with cents, express your currency as cents, store it as cents, operate on it as cents, and only format it as dollars / eurs or whatever
[04:01:45] <entuland> as for the actual formatting of the float representation, the PHP docs have plenty of options to format such numbers with a fixed amount of decimals
[04:07:49] <sine> right ok
[04:16:21] <entuland> just as a quick hint as to the bad things that may happen (since I provided no rationale above): https://3v4l.org/M6GRD - there is plenty of literature about that around if you are interested
[04:19:38] <Byteflux> indeed. subtracting 0.2 from 0.3 and then 0.1 from that only gives back a number that is close to zero, but not zero. in this case it was 0.000000000000000055511151231258 if you convert from that notation
[04:19:55] <Byteflux> it's an inherent flaw in floating point math that makes it unsuitable for representing currency.
[04:20:03] <Byteflux> fine for almost anything else
[04:20:46] <Byteflux> some languages that decimal types that would be good for this, like Java has BigDecimal... but PHP has nothing built-in like it so pretty much stuck with integers.
[04:24:33] <Blondie101010> there are at least 2 common libraries for it

[04:42:06] <celphi> k ty
[04:42:29] <Blondie101010> definitely a good idea to look for existing libs
[04:43:09] <Blondie101010> but when dealing with real transactions, you should consult with your accountant and/or lawyer

[05:18:46] <Byteflux> yeah true. if you don't do any arithmetic then you could probably just store it as a float... although probably just better to use an int any way for future-proof.

[06:02:15] <celphi> is it better to use a templating engine or use plain php tags within html
[06:02:57] <__adrian> there's no "php tags within html."  it's a php script with html output.  :p
[06:03:00] <__adrian> answer is, depends
[06:03:05] <Byteflux> Better is a loaded term here
[06:03:17] <celphi> so its not clear cut
[06:03:28] <__adrian> it depends on what your needs are
[06:03:40] <__adrian> most times, a plain php template works fine
[06:04:03] <celphi> __adrian: well i see html pages with like a million php tags and it looks messy
[06:04:16] <__adrian> so don't make messy ones
[06:04:52] <Byteflux> A lot of that can be alleviated by keeping templates small and just including pieces
[06:04:56] <celphi> `<?= echo $some_var; ?>` looks clear though
[06:05:07] <__adrian> what you're describing sounds more like the sterotypical "all the logic goes in this html" webpage
[06:05:12] <Blondie101010> you can't have php tags inside the html output unless you set up your webserver wrong
[06:05:17] <__adrian> don't write those. templates are _only_ the output.
[06:05:48] <Byteflux> All of the data should have been prepared by the controller, the template's only concern is how it will be displayed.
[06:05:48] <__adrian> and yeah, it's php with html output, not html with php
[06:05:51] <celphi> so what about like `<title><?= echo $title; ?></title>`?
[06:05:58] <__adrian> what about it?
[06:06:02] <celphi> good or bad?
[06:06:08] <Byteflux> bad
[06:06:10] <Byteflux> because you dont need echo there
[06:06:11] <__adrian> bad
[06:06:16] <Byteflux> and also it's not escaped
[06:06:20] <Byteflux> well, presumably
[06:06:22] <celphi> so use string replace?
[06:06:23] <__adrian> no echo, and also  https://php.net/htmlspecialchars
[06:06:28] <__adrian> no
[06:06:42] <__adrian> <title><?= htmlspecialchars($title) ?></title>
[06:07:01] <Byteflux> `<?=` means `<?php echo`
[06:07:07] <celphi> oh
[06:08:41] <celphi> so what about <ul><li></li></ul> with lots of lis? would i just make them all in the rendering function then assign it to a variable to be placed on the html document?

[06:09:33] <Blondie101010> it's NOT a HTML document

[06:12:02] <Byteflux> but also, why would you want to make <li>'s in the controller? assuming that's what you meant
[06:12:15] <celphi> i guess im trying to think of a solution that allows a designer to work around php code
[06:12:28] <celphi> *so they dont have to mess with it
[06:12:39] <celphi> where they could just focus on moving around the html
[06:12:43] <Byteflux> Well a template engine is a valid answer to that question
[06:12:45] <__adrian> your designer needs to know enough about code to do their job
[06:12:57] <celphi> well that means you'd have to pay them more
[06:12:59] <Byteflux> We did say it depends on your needs
[06:13:02] <__adrian> template engine vs. plain php, same concepts
[06:13:06] <celphi> but if they just are css/html
[06:13:07] <__adrian> no it doesn't
[06:13:21] <celphi> in USA it does
[06:13:25] <__adrian> they need to understand the same concepts. variables, conditionals, loops
[06:13:50] <__adrian> there's NO difference in the skill required. using a template engine so you can pretend your designers are idiots is disengenious
[06:14:01] <celphi> i agree- but im trying to minimize code as much as possible in the html documents
[06:14:13] <__adrian> again, no difference
[06:14:15] <Byteflux> But designers that are actually involved in templating tend to be adaptive regardless of the templating "language"
[06:14:29] <__adrian> you can't minimize out the things you need
[06:14:32] <Byteflux> There are designers that do photoshop/css/etc but not all designers do templating.
[06:14:36] <__adrian> ^
[06:14:43] <celphi> i agree
[06:14:49] <__adrian> if they do templating, they do logic
[06:14:55] <Byteflux> If they do templating, then they're usually smart enough to know how to do it in PHP or Twig or whatever.
[06:15:07] <__adrian> ^ they _need_ to be.
[06:15:17] <celphi> again they cost more
[06:15:24] <__adrian> you NEED that skill
[06:15:39] <Byteflux> They don't cost more, they cost the same lol
[06:15:41] <Byteflux> It's the same skill
[06:15:44] <__adrian> pay for it. don't try to weasle around it.
[06:15:56] <Byteflux> We're not saying they have to be PHP experts
[06:16:17] <__adrian> otherwise you're talking about hiring someone who's qualified, but pretending they aren't just so you can get the same work but pay them for less.
[06:16:32] <__adrian> yeah, they don't need to be senior devs or anything
[06:16:42] <celphi> they're not hired as senior devs

[06:17:29] <Byteflux> The *only* difference is the syntax.

[06:21:11] <__adrian> no it can't
[06:21:26] <celphi> why not
[06:21:29] <__adrian> the template needs _display_ logic. it needs to be free of business logic.
[06:21:46] <__adrian> e.g., it shouldn't process input or query the database.
[06:22:06] <celphi> if it had a html document and JS updating the dom based on json sent to client i could have a document free of variables
[06:22:12] <Rockwood> celphi, he is trying to explain backend and frontend difference here
[06:22:14] <__adrian> but it MUST know how to display text/values, how to check conditions to display this vs. that, and so on.
[06:22:44] <__adrian> no you wouldn't  :/  you're just moving it to the browser.
[06:23:16] <celphi> ya that's fine but at least the designer could just move the html around freely
[06:23:17] <Rockwood> celphi, by node you can replace PHP not by only JS
[06:23:27] <celphi> nah i prefer  php
[06:23:41] <Byteflux> Assume for a moment that your backend is just an API and you only use JavaScript to communicate with your server to retrieve or send data based on user interactions in the browser. Many applications today are in fact designed this way. You still need templates. You still need some way to apply logic to the way your data is structured within HTML.
[06:24:46] <ss23> I just serve my users raw JSON and a swagger file and let them figure out the rest
[06:24:50] <ss23> Templates are for suckers
[06:24:52] <celphi> ie. say i have a table written in html. and on document load ajax fires off and fills in the table. that means my table is free of variables
[06:25:11] <Rockwood> you can display things nicely in browser with help of html + JS + CSS
[06:25:28] <Rockwood> DB hold the values
[06:26:13] <Rockwood> your good JSON make your work easy
[06:26:25] <Rockwood> i means proper json
[06:26:35] <Rockwood> format should be good
[06:26:49] <Byteflux> celphi: It also means your application is very limited in how it can present data.
[06:27:03] <celphi> how come?
[06:27:10] <Byteflux> And CSS is the only tool designers will have in your example.
[06:28:23] <celphi> we have lots of programmers that dont know CSS but the designers do- but the designers dont know php and cant figure out how to move php code around w/o breaking page. so im trying to come up with a solution
[06:29:03] <celphi> im not in a position to redesign everyhting but i can make future pages simplier

[06:29:50] <celphi> bc designers refuse to learn php
[06:30:14] <Rockwood> celphi, no
[06:30:21] <Byteflux> That is a completely false statement.
[06:30:28] <celphi> what is false?
[06:30:38] <Rockwood> celphi> bc designers refuse to learn php
[06:30:47] <Byteflux> Designers whose role includes templating skills are going to learn whatever templating language/engine they are told to use.
[06:30:48] <celphi> not all- the ones at my job do
[06:30:52] <__adrian> they need to know basic things like vars, loops, conditions. else they can't do their jobs at all, regardless of whether they're using a templating language or plain php.
[06:31:01] <__adrian> if they don't, then they can't do their jobs.
[06:31:12] <Rockwood> i think he is confusing
[06:31:13] <__adrian> if they CAN do their jobs then they can do it either way.
[06:31:34] <celphi> their job is to design pages- doing the css is a bonus - but they cant do with php in template
[06:31:41] <Rockwood> before this how do you make websites?
[06:31:47] <Byteflux> Okay, that just means templating isn't their job
[06:31:50] <__adrian> ^
[06:31:53] <celphi> exactly
[06:31:53] <Byteflux> But templating is still *someone's* job.
[06:31:59] <Byteflux> It might be the programmer's.
[06:32:03] <__adrian> so you take what they made and turn it into a template,.
[06:32:08] <Byteflux> Yep

[06:32:44] <Byteflux> Just because *your* designers aren't required to learn templating, doesn't mean the need for templating *ceases to exist*
[06:32:50] <__adrian> what did you hire them to do? plain html? then take the plain html and turn it into a template.
[06:33:01] <celphi> i didnt hire them
[06:33:07] <celphi> im new here
[06:33:23] <celphi> all the code is procedural
[06:33:28] <celphi> like php5 days
[06:33:34] <celphi> 0 encapsulation
[06:33:45] <celphi> 1 million php tags in one html document
[06:33:51] <Rockwood> celphi, but you are JS channel from long time
[06:33:53] <Byteflux> Most likely then you're going to be expected to produce the templates for their designs.
[06:34:12] <Byteflux> This is how it works when the designer's role doesn't include templating.
[06:34:22] <Byteflux> It doesn't mean templating just stops existing.
[06:34:36] <celphi> Rockwood: i know js, but this isnt a js issue
[06:35:16] <Rockwood> logically both are same
[06:35:48] <Rockwood> just one for frontend and second for backend

[06:49:56] <Rockwood> work on new things and other additions
[06:50:34] <celphi> honestly i dont thik they make more $ unless they redo it all (including design) - but it seems their investors want more features and bugs  fixed and so there's  not much time to redo anything. so im looking for thing to improve page load and simplify the pages so the designers can help out on desiging pages since the programmers know next to nothing for CSS
[06:51:09] <__adrian> programmers shouldn't have to
[06:51:17] <celphi> they're still using floats :/
[06:51:22] <Byteflux> lol. this is one of those "just a paycheck" jobs. sounds like a dead end.
[06:52:00] <__adrian> and if your designers only write html, then that's that. they make html, give it to the programmers, who turn the html into templates.
[06:52:07] <__adrian> that's all there is to it
[06:52:33] <celphi> they dont even make the html. it's basically a programmer finding a bootstrap idea and trying plug it into the page
[06:52:49] <celphi> and you have a complete mess of js styling pages
[06:53:01] <celphi> the js makes me cry

[06:55:39] <celphi> at least that's what i was told
[06:56:08] <celphi> so the focus now is to just fix bugs and optimize w/e it doesnt take too much time
[06:56:33] <__adrian> "celphi> so the focus now is to just fix bugs and optimize"  and you think that means writing a new templating system?

[13:10:09] <TinoDidriksen> You can prepare the MP4 file to be streaming/offset capable in itself.

[13:17:01] <TinoDidriksen> Use a database instead.
[13:17:06] <gry> sqlite?
[13:17:22] <TinoDidriksen> Sure, SQLite will work. Use transactions.
[13:17:41] <fentanyl> i've an mp4 file, when i include that as .mp4 on the 'src', it requires to get the whole file before it can start to play. and it also consumes a lot of memory, since it wants to get the whole mp4 file. that's the reason why i wanna stream it but for streaming, i'm required to use AWS or some other company's CDNs since i cannot setup a streaming service.
[13:17:46] <fentanyl> TinoDidriksen:
[13:23:08] <TinoDidriksen> fentanyl, you can encode the MP4 with options that allow it to be seeked in and play before it's fully loaded. Such as ffmpeg -movflags +faststart

[23:19:47] <zro> perhaps ill have to reconsider or just use a 3rd party parser
[23:20:14] <__adrian> you want to translate your endpoints?
[23:20:53] <ramblebamble> @__adrian, I had the very same expression and disbelief when I started working for my soon to be ex employer,
[23:21:20] <__adrian> that was more looking for clarification than an expression of disbelief
[23:21:22] <ramblebamble> does make sense though, in some wiered fd up SEO sense of thinking
[23:21:27] <zro> seems to me that having /en/news and /fr/nouvelles makes more sense than /en/nouvelles and /fr/nouvelles no?
[23:22:01] <__adrian> yeah, not questioning whether it's a good idea, just whether it's what you're talking about  :)
[23:22:11] <zro> its weird to me that everyone freaks out when i suggest that this makes sense, but no one will engage me on it
[23:22:31] <TinoDidriksen> I would omit the /en and /fr when not needed, but I know many things require them.
[23:22:36] <__adrian> i'd probably do it in config rather than try to run translations for everything on the fly
[23:23:14] <zro> i was planning on generating a static config file, but rather than provide translators with text files, i was gonna just give em PO files like i am for the rest of the MESSAGES domain
[23:23:26] <zro> was trying to generate the config array from the gettext
[23:23:30] <__adrian> that makes sense too
[23:23:40] <ramblebamble> zro, I would use language information from some source , e.g. domain, or chosen language, client language or prefix  /en /fr but translating routes is problematic, you can do it, but it costs
[23:24:21] <zro> i dont think I followed that ramblebamble
[23:26:09] <zro> TinoDidriksen: hmmm. omit the en and fr, hmmm. Makes sense in terms of news vs nouvelles, but something like "contact" would be the same in both langs
[23:26:15] <zro> en and fr that is

[23:26:47] <__adrian> zro: language-in-the-url should be an option, not a norm
[23:26:57] <ramblebamble> zro, it will cost you in sense of maintenance, and handling complexity, all of the sudden you do not have a single endpoint for a resource any more
[23:27:01] <TinoDidriksen> Yeah, for germanic/romance languages there's too much overlap to omit the language code.
[23:27:14] <ramblebamble> because depending on your setup/architecture a translation is the same resource as the original
[23:27:20] <__adrian> 1) user preference 2) url 3) Accept-language header
[23:27:33] <__adrian> and it will almost always come down to the header
[23:27:35] <__adrian> as it should
[23:27:44] <ramblebamble> additionally, if it is not the same resource, you can just specify a different url and tie it to that specific domain
[23:27:51] <ramblebamble> so no problem there
[23:28:32] <zro> i would think that the lack of language identifier in URL just means it negotiates from header
[23:29:23] <zro> ... and redirects
[23:29:42] <zro> eg request to example.com redirects to example.com/en or /fr based on accept header
[23:30:00] <__adrian> negotiates yes, redirects no
[23:30:16] <zro> really?
[23:30:22] <zro> hm
[23:30:32] <ramblebamble> depends on the implementation serverside

[23:31:45] <__adrian> "why" is the better question
[23:31:49] <__adrian> what's the benefit?
[23:31:52] <zro> i mean, im rolling this from scratch and just trying to figure out the "best" way
[23:31:58] <ramblebamble> I would also prefer s.th. like a get-parameter but technically that would mean that it should return the same resource, you know REST etc. and a translation is a tid bit different :)
[23:32:11] <zro> cuz example.com/en/contact and example.com/fr/contact are technically 2 different documents, no?
[23:32:24] <__adrian> i would not expect them to be different resources
[23:32:31] <ramblebamble> @__adrian, so it boils down to REST i believ
[23:32:42] <__adrian> i would expect them to be the same resource presented in different languages
[23:32:49] <__adrian> ARE they different?
[23:33:02] <zro> i mean.... not spiritually, i guess ya
[23:33:14] <zro> but in terms of eg /news
[23:33:17] <zro> ...
[23:33:22] <ramblebamble> both are possible, the moment you have varying language versions of field content, and composition it does make sense
[23:33:48] <__adrian> so you'd be adding a redirect for every request, making uris less memorable, all for something that 99/100 times would be properly determined by the header anyway.
[23:33:52] <ramblebamble> zro, so you offer a different feed per language?
[23:33:53] <zro> /fr/nouvelles would front load an index of french lanuguage posts vs /en/news would front load english, so those indexes would be different?
[23:34:50] <__adrian> "zro> but in terms of eg /news"  is it differnt news (i.e., does it determine what's displayed (by region) and not just language)?
[23:35:01] <zro> just lang
[23:35:20] <biberu> zro: couldn't they just refer to the same endpoint, with the language framgent as a parameter?
[23:35:38] <biberu> fragment*
[23:35:39] <ramblebamble> biberu, no different queries, IMHO
[23:35:40] <__adrian> and are all the news articles (ideally) presented in either language? more importantly, does the content vary between languages?
[23:35:42] <zro> you mean /en/news and /fr/news, biberu ?
[23:35:49] <biberu> zro: yes
[23:35:58] <ramblebamble> ah ok that woudl work sorry misunderstood
[23:36:15] <zro> biberu: but why not /en/nouvelles and /fr/nouvelles, eg. why force one language on different language user?
[23:36:50] <zro> __adrian: *ideally* yes. realistically, probably not
[23:37:06] <__adrian> "with the language framgent as a parameter?"  // this, but also, don't overlook the point that ideally you DON'T need this parameter at all. ideally, most people would omit it and you'd decide language based on their Accept-language.
[23:37:22] <ramblebamble> zro because they want to choose and if french news are not available in the english feed they have switch
[23:37:26] <__adrian> you'd only need/want this in the uri when they need to forcibly override that.
[23:37:51] <biberu> zro: how would it force anything? if a user comes there via a url that specifies the language you could choose that, otherwise you could look at some preference or headers?
[23:38:05] <ramblebamble> @__adrian, but then the language for translation would become part of the query and implicit parameter are somewhat unnice
[23:38:06] <__adrian> "ramblebamble> if french news are not available in the english feed"  // this is what i asked above, whether it was different feeds or translations of the same feed
[23:38:41] <ramblebamble> must've mist it
[23:38:47] <zro> ideally publisher translates everything, but in reality, prolly not
[23:39:07] <__adrian> zro: so if something is not translated, you'd get the closest-match version.

[23:57:39] <zro> anyone got any good reading or examples of good i18n type stuff?
[23:58:07] <ramblebamble> zro, you can use uuids and write code to link 2 entites as translations of one another cross-domain
[23:59:50] <ramblebamble> but that would make the 2 sites part of one another and the code you write will need to scale probably, and federated sites have their own sets of issues
