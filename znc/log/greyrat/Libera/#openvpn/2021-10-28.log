[17:23:03] <pmjdebruijn> I'm have an issue where Windows clients, are resolving DNS via a public nameserver (via the ethernet interface)_as opposed to OpenVPN provided nameservers, we've looking into SMHNR, and there's the interface metrics, which presumably determine dns search order
[17:23:21] <pmjdebruijn> has anybody here encountered this issue as well, any tips on how best to deal with it
[17:23:36] <pmjdebruijn> block-outside-dns seems a bit "strong" :)

[18:01:19] <xx> does it cause issues if I use `--user nobody` and `--group nogroup` in the client.conf and it is used on windows? Or do I need to remove those settings?
[18:31:39] <rob0> pmjdebruijn: Windows has a thing called NRPT (name resolution policy table) which might be what you are after.
[18:32:40] <rob0> I've been forced to learn a little bit about it because of $dayjob, but I don't know much.  Microsoft does have extensive Powershell documentation.
[18:33:55] <rob0> xx: that's a TIAS answer: Try It And See.  I know that --group and --user are not supported on Windows.  I'd expect them to generate a non-fatal error in logs.
[18:38:55] <xx> rob0: I don't have a windows machine at hand, am generating a config file for someone computer-illitarate who uses windows
[18:39:19] <xx> they would not know what a log file is or to send it to me. they likely won't even know that the connection did not work.
