[19:41:42] <bookworm> debugging docker when it fails 5+h
[19:41:45] <bookworm> just saying
[19:42:15] <bookworm> the amount of times we had to babysit people with permissions and so forth is much higher for docker
[19:42:40] <bookworm> as now suddenly you have not one permissions and networking stack but 2 each
[19:43:31] <bookworm> but sure once you understand it docker can be great
[19:43:51] <xnaas> basically
[19:44:01] <xnaas> getting to "oh I get it" was a pita lol
[19:44:10] <xnaas> especially the networking shit, tbh
[19:44:45] <bookworm> doesn't help that there's multiple drivers and different defaults for swarm/compose vs vanilla docker
[19:44:48] <xnaas> anyway, that's why I prefaced with "isn't pushing Docker" :P

[19:47:55] <Activ8> if they renamed things and put things in proper categories it would be alright.  i.e Network Tab for all networking lol
[19:48:11] <Activ8> It's just terminology with docker that throws me as per usual with everything
[19:48:17] <bookworm> it is in their own config section
[19:49:22] <bookworm> docker os actually not bad documentation wise, the problem is that people don't understand the underlying kernel primitives
[19:49:36] <bookworm> and hence they don't understand the behavior
[19:50:39] <bookworm> what follows is the usual "apply sudo and --force until it works" approach and in the end they have a completely insecure configuration
[19:51:24] <bookworm> docker is a bit shitty security wise as it has a root owned daemon. podman is better

[19:51:44] <xnaas> Last time I looked, podman finally had something similar to docker-compose

[23:26:29] <xnaas> I got a job interview-related email from .gov that got sent to spam by google (don't have my firstlast.com yet)
[23:26:39] <xnaas> :/
[23:27:28] <Activ8> emails very problematic
[23:31:50] <bookworm> it's nuts, some spam assassin filters happily give you a -2 just because of a TLD that's new-ish, not my fault that all names that you might want are already taken since the 90ies
[23:31:58] <Activ8> too many people are using emails as spam boxes this is the main issue so accounts and domains are flagged and then the problems begin
[23:32:38] <bookworm> I'm fine with flagging emails based on the content of the mail, but based on the TLD is just stupid
[23:32:54] <xnaas> I'm amazed my .info makes it into any inboxes!

[23:33:10] <bookworm> some nutshow on the postfix ML even blocks all not in org/net/com and some county TLDs
[23:33:11] <Activ8> if you use email you know what you have to do
