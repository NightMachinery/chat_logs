[22:29:16] <wyre> hi guys, I have a patch file and I'd like to fix the paths because I'd like to use it in another repository https://bpa.st/NQIQ
[22:29:41] <wyre> do you know if could I use sed to search an replace the path strings? 
[22:30:28] <wyre> the problem is I need to include the basename of the file for every path as the folder name where the file is contained 
[22:30:51] *** Quits: malina (~malina@user/malina) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[22:31:19] <wyre> the point is ... could I use the basename of the files to include that folder in the path with sed? 
[22:32:20] <Soliton> probably easier to just show desired output.
[22:33:10] <wyre> Soliton, well, I'll do then by hand and I'll show you ðŸ˜‰
[22:33:45] <Soliton> ok.
[22:38:26] *** Quits: tsujp (~tsujp@sourcehut/user/tsujp) (Quit: Client closed)
[22:39:30] <wyre> Soliton, this is the diff of what I want to do https://bpa.st/5CZQ
[22:39:46] <wyre> but as you can see ... since all strings are in the same file ... I need to use something like a pattern
[22:39:59] <wyre> because every three lines the script name varies ... 
[22:40:57] <wyre> this is the original file http://ix.io/3Lhe and this is what I want to get http://ix.io/3Lhd
[22:44:26] <Soliton> ugh, terrible code in the diffs.
[22:45:04] <wyre> Soliton, sure
[22:45:12] <wyre> I'd like to fix those scripts a little
[22:45:16] <wyre> but I'm working on them
[22:46:09] <wyre> apparently I should use some called capturing group ðŸ¤”

[22:51:33] <emanuele6> Soliton: without $ and with `g'
[22:52:01] <emanuele6> diff --git b/polybar/.config/polybar/polybar-scripts/updates-pacman-aurhelper.sh a/polybar/.config/polybar/polybar-scripts/updates-pacman-aurhelper.sh
[22:52:03] <emanuele6> for that line ^
[22:52:21] <Soliton> right, didn't consider the diff thingy.
[22:54:03] <Soliton> the added quotes in $(()) are not helping anything and make it a syntax error in shells that don't remove quotes there.
[22:55:02] <Soliton> luckily the shell injection seems to be commented out.
[22:57:33] <emanuele6> these files have a .sh extension
[22:57:42] <emanuele6> > +updates=$(("$updates_arch" + "$updates_aur"))
[22:57:53] <emanuele6> that is not portable, it will fail in dash
[22:58:13] <emanuele6> oh, Soliton was talking about the same thing oops
[23:05:27] <earnest> emanuele6: Why would that fail?
[23:05:36] <earnest> (As not portable)
[23:05:51] <earnest> Hm
[23:06:14] <earnest> d# a=1; echo "$(("$a" + 2))"
[23:06:15] <shbot> earnest: dash: 1: arithmetic expression: expecting primary: ""1" + 2"
[23:06:21] <earnest> I see
[23:07:44] <emanuele6> yeah https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/issues/2055
[23:20:15] <wyre> I guess I have to replace the shebang ðŸ˜‰
[23:21:12] <emanuele6> or remove quotes ... and $
[23:21:16] <Soliton> the quotes are useless. it was fine before the change.
[23:21:38] <emanuele6> updates=$((updates_arch + updates_aur))
[23:21:50] <emanuele6> that is the correct and portable syntax

[23:44:54] <Mehavoid> Hi, can tell me what the problem is? I get the link from the letter https://pastebin.com/XhxQBqi2 using the pattern sed -n '/^http/p' And it works, but the variable is assigned a value with a single quote at the beginning https://pastebin.com/epsQ7MFK I only need to extract the link without the quotes. Thanks!
[23:47:06] <Soliton> looks like some misreading of set -x output.
[23:52:16] <Soliton> i guess there are windows line endings involved.
