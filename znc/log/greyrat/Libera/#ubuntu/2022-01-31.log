[17:18:00] <crackerjack> ren0v0_: it looks like you have included a key for (assuming luks) encryption in your initial ram disk (initrd).  this is a security risk as any individual with access to the initrd could potentially extract said key that has bad permissions.

[23:47:21] <tomreyn> i'm not sure i'm getting the question right, but you can try: activities -> fonts, then just wait for all fonts to load and show "Aa" in their very type. or click a font to see an example text rendere din this font.
