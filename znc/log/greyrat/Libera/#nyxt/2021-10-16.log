[00:00:16] <jmercouris> it works, you just have to also unbind the original keys
[00:00:22] <jmercouris> otherwise both commands will be run I think
[00:00:28] <jmercouris> or just the first one, and then not the second
[00:00:31] <mariari> idk i've had issues I'd have to try again
[00:00:39] <mariari> I just found it drops it entirely
[00:00:42] <jmercouris> Hm
[00:02:34] <mariari> and bam another crash
[00:02:43] <mariari> 16 minutes I guess this time lol
[00:02:55] <mariari> note this is still much better than it was I think
[00:02:59] <jmercouris> :-D
[00:03:03] <jmercouris> well, progress is progress...
[00:03:18] <mariari> I really think it's webkit corrupting

[00:06:38] <mariari> jmercouris: I found something interesting!
[00:06:48] <mariari> so I tried pasting in an url in this git overview thing right
[00:06:56] <mariari> when I press enter not in application mode it doesn't work
[00:06:58] <mariari> the link goes away
[00:07:02] <mariari> if I paste it in application mode
[00:07:05] <mariari> and press enter it works

[18:29:34] <dije> Hi all. More of my saved-for-the-weekend questions...
[18:30:12] <dije> Just noticed that I can't navigate backwards from a Nyxt forum (discourse) post to the forum top level
[18:30:20] <dije> The page with the post just reloads
[18:30:38] <dije> With some dynamic highlighting for one or other of the entries
[18:31:25] <dije> I have to M-g M-g and select the top-level icon link (top left)

[18:51:51] <dije> One of the most powerful features of Conkeror is the ability to use the link hint system not only for links, but for any DOM node. The ability to copy precisely-delimited text without using the mouse or the arrow keys (or their moral equivalent) is fantastic. I don't think Nyxt offers this yet.

[19:52:47] <dije> jmercouris: that's the equivalent (more or less) of Conkeror's "caret mode". Useful and powerful, but not as powerful as what I'm talking about.
[19:54:23] <dije> The difference is that every visually-presented DOM node is hinted, and selecting one copies all of that DOM node's visible textual content. No navigation, no highlighting.
[19:54:53] <dije> This is all based on Conkeror's "browser object" abstraction.
[19:56:11] <dije> Once you have a class of "browser objects", you can do anything that makes sense to all instances of that class.
[19:57:45] <dije> So in Conkeror, to copy all of the text of one of the entries on this page, I would type '* * c' to say that I want to copy a DOM node, and then select the hint for whichever I wanted, whether it be someone's name, the time they hit Enter, or the text of the entry.
[19:58:30] <dije> Much, much more efficient, especially for things like `<ul>` or `<ol>` lists.
[19:58:55] <jmercouris> dije: I see, Iâ€™m not sure I understand yet, but we have I think all the prerequisites to build what you are suggest
[19:59:01] <jmercouris> Suggesting*
[19:59:08] <dije> Right, absolutely
[20:01:18] <dije> Of course, 'class' is a different thing in CLOS than in JS, but the concept should map over.
