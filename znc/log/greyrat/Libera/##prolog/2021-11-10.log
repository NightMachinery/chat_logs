[22:43:25] <bingulo> Hi folks, I'm new to prolog and have a doubt. I want to know if is there a way to specify in a rule with the same name of other facts in that way: Having a f(X), if X isn't on a fact, compute it as a rule. With this, I don't want to have any duplicate atom when I search f(X), cause the rule will only be applied for atoms with none facts over these.

[22:49:14] <ccx> bingulo: Not sure what exactly you mean. Predicates are distinguished by name and arity (number of arguments). When called prolog will try to run each matching clause (whether it's fact or rule) until it succeeds. You can use ! to stop it from trying other clauses but it will make your code logically impure.

[23:09:57] <bingulo> ccx: Suppose I want to define a start of some event as a fact like: "start(some_event,start_time).". So, I have the duration of events as facts and may have the final of eventas facts or as a clause that compute final time using start and duration times. When I run it, the events with final time setted by a fact will be computed too by the clause that uses start and duration times. What I want is
[23:09:59] <bingulo> that this clause dont search for events with final time setted as fact.

[23:25:04] <ccx> Yeah you really want to structure that differently. At very least consider something like  end(Event,EndTime) :- end_override(Event,EndTime) *-> true ; start(Event,StartTime), duration(Event,Duration), EndTime is StartTime + Duration.
[23:25:23] <ccx> And use end_override/2 facts.
[23:37:31] <bingulo> ccx: I dont know what *-> mean, where could I find documentation about this? And that /2 mean the order with prolog will search clauses?

[23:39:32] <[relay]_> <dmiles> the "/2" or "/3" means that the predicate takes 2 or 3 arguments
[23:41:06] <ccx> https://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=control
[23:43:42] <ccx> It's if-then-else construct esentially. Either end_override/2 succeeds or it will try to compute EndTime from start/2 and duration/2.
[23:44:01] <ccx> Obviously this isn't logically pure either.
