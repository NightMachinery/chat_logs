[05:13:43] <cannibal^> Oookay, upgrading to nvidia proprietary 495 instead of 470 changes it to "fro.t..ft" and "... Right".
[05:13:43] <cannibal^> I've got to wonder if I can't blacklist the nvidia hdmi audio output module. Bet that might do something.
[05:16:27] <cannibal^> I *will* check back if I figure this out.

[05:17:31] <mw__> i have 18.04 on my desktop, here alacritty from genuine ubuntu package works just fine
[05:17:54] <mw__> i guess the next logical step is to try booting it on those

[05:26:23] <tomreyn> oh you said so <mw__> on 21.10 there is no official alacritty package, only a snap that I installed
[05:27:20] <tomreyn> i'd guess it was dropped for being unsupportable in debian
[05:28:14] <tomreyn> hmm, actually there is no "alacritty" package in ubuntu at all

[05:30:44] <JackFrost> `rmadison -u ubuntu alacritty` seems to indicate it doesn't exist in any supported Ubuntu release.
[05:31:06] <JackFrost> There's a couple PPAs that have it.
[05:34:00] <tomreyn> and, if i am interpreting the html source of https://snapcraft.io/alacritty right (i really hope i'm not), 100% of ubuntu 20.04 users are using the alacritty snap.
[05:34:57] <mw__> so i guess that means i better let it go / revert to 18.04 if i really want to use it
[05:35:23] <mw__> which btw sounds lucrative, i just hate what they did to kde
[05:35:24] <tomreyn> https://github.com/tunix/alacritty-snap seems to suggest you should be installing it as a --classic snap
[05:35:35] <mw__> yes, i had to
[05:35:43] <tomreyn> which i assume may be needed to get opengl bindings going

[05:51:34] <mw__> and this is one of the reasons why alacritty feels so important, it's offloading a lot of load to the gpu, runs faster, more responsive, and terminal windows can consume a surprising amount of juice
[05:52:17] <mw__> but the best part is its nice config for mappings, i dunno if i can get it elsewhere

[07:52:57] <aandrew> hey everyone. I have a source tree (regal) which builds fine on older versions of Ubuntu, but with 21.10 it can't seem to find dlsym/dlopen_mode. I'm already linking -ldl and google's suggesting -Wl,--no-as-needed,-ldl which seems to have worked for others, but the result is the same here

[08:25:34] <jehlow> any suggestions on how to connect to openvpn connection automatically during boot/login (Single user PC running Ubuntu 20.10 using NetworkManager with vpn credentials present;I know how to connect via Terminal if there is another way like making a script?)
[08:26:46] <jehlow> Also came accross a guide but its old;A question how are gconf files edited-can i just use any text editor as #User
[08:26:56] <tomreyn> !20.10
[08:26:57] <ubottu> Ubuntu 20.10 (Groovy Gorilla) was the 33rd release of Ubuntu, support ended July 22nd, 2021. See !eol and https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-announce/2021-June/000269.html
[08:27:46] <jehlow> the guide mentions to edit some pages with gconf-editor, but that is obviously very old and im new to this
[08:28:06] <jehlow> edditing config files if thats what they are
[08:28:18] <tomreyn> if you really have 20.10, you can either install a newer release or try an unsupported upgrade to a version we can support here
[08:30:11] <jehlow> sorry 21.10
[08:30:13] <tomreyn> lsb_release -ds    in a terminal can confirm which ubuntu version you have

[08:31:35] <tomreyn> 21.10 is supported here. you can just tick the box in the network manager configuration GUI for this openvpn connection to have it started automatically when the network interface it binds to is brought up.
[08:35:42] <tomreyn> jehlow: ah, sorry, it's actually the other wa around. once you have the openvpn connection configured, you can then configure the underlying connection (ethernet/wireless...) to automatically start this vpn connection as soon as this underlying interface it brought up.

[11:36:24] <nuxer> Hi there! I've been looking into building a server for NAS and dedicated test server use. Since everything's more or less a hassle for availability, I stumbled upon Dell's tower servers that would be available from my supplier (Dell T40 to Dell T140). Any ideas on whether or not the Linux support for i.e. the RAID controllers etc is good and so
[11:36:24] <nuxer> forth? Should I be okay with a Ubuntu Server or aim for a different distro?
[11:38:34] <nuxer> The Dell server types are Dell EMC PowerEdge T-series and I do have previous experience on setting up my own Linux boxes on various architectures as well as NAS/SAN environments, mostly for soho use

[11:41:08] <nuxer> I know this is half a distro-related question and half a hardware-related question, but I was wondering if there are some O.G. serveradmins around who would have some insight on whether or not I'm investing wisely. I guess I could call the business retailer for the Dell's and inquire them about this, but I'd be interested in hearing your takes if
[11:41:09] <nuxer> you have any experience with the particular series of Dell's servers, especially when it comes to setting up a NAS with RAID over its controller (if it's supported, and how well ... etc.)
[11:42:06] <nuxer> (and also would be inbterested in hearing of any possible setup-related caveats I should be aware of)
[11:43:14] <nuxer> It says in its specs that its RAID controller is "Intel VROC 6.x (software based)"

[18:12:55] <MrCollinsGA> but I want it to auto mount. where do I tell it to do that
[18:13:05] <ducasse> it does that
[18:13:24] <MrCollinsGA> ok sorry im not being smart: what is 'it'
[18:13:26] <ducasse> anything in fstab is automounted unless you mark it noauto
[18:13:42] <MrCollinsGA> but how do it know that it's mounting something?
[18:13:53] <MrCollinsGA> does*
[18:13:57] <ducasse> the 'mount' command is run as 'mount -a' on boot
[18:14:40] <ducasse> 'mount -a' mounts everything in fstab
[18:14:56] <MrCollinsGA> ok so when I boot there is a command to kernel mount -a somewhere there is a file telling boot to do that
[18:15:18] <ducasse> essentially, yes
[18:15:26] <MrCollinsGA> ah.
[18:15:37] <MrCollinsGA> thank you for clearing that up ducasse

[19:38:14] <cbreak> ansible is more than just a recipe for what to do
[19:38:20] <cbreak> it describes the state you want
[19:38:22] <jhutchins> cbreak: I mean live console sessions, not scripted.
[19:38:41] <cbreak> you're guaranteed to be able to apply the same ansible playbook multiple times, and it'll work fine
[19:38:43] <merpnderp> Trying to mix yaml and bash is going to be annoying. Plus having to learn the yaml configs.
[19:39:19] <cbreak> for example, you don't write an "ansible script" to add some line to a config file. You'd write an ansible playbook entry that describes a line you want to have in the file.
[19:39:26] *** pong is now known as beaver
[19:39:27] <jhutchins> merpnderp: Ansible is pretty reasonable and logical.
[19:39:41] *** Quits: seednode (~seednode@user/seednode) (Quit: Nihil supernum.)
[19:39:43] <cbreak> and if that line's already there, it won't add an other one
[19:39:49] <merpnderp> jhutchins: perhaps, but in the first playbook example they just do yum install nginx.
[19:40:05] <merpnderp> I install from nginx's repos. So it's a bit more complicated.
[19:40:10] <jhutchins> One of the gotchas about ansible is that if you run different versions, or even the same version on different OSs/versions, you can get different results (mostly different errors).
[19:40:26] <cbreak> or you would not write "apt install blah-package", you'd write apt: name: blah-package ; state: present
[19:41:02] <cbreak> or state: latest
[19:41:10] <cbreak> you describe what you want, not how to get there
[19:41:25] <jhutchins> Yep.  Pretty smooth.
[19:41:26] <leftyfb> I don't think they're going to bother with ansible at this point

[19:42:19] <merpnderp> Yeah, I'm a programmer who's been advocating for Ubuntu to replace some of our machines for 10 years and when we finally do it, they stick me with doing all the security crap.

[19:47:07] <cbreak> via git :)
[19:47:16] <merpnderp> leftyfb: yeah, I was thinking that was the best part of the playbooks
[19:47:32] <merpnderp> They show what all is happening and how.
[19:47:45] <cbreak> some of the setup I wasn't able to put into ansible
[19:48:01] <cbreak> but most of it is there, and I think it helps a lot for describing how it's set up
[19:48:31] <leftyfb> merpnderp: mind you, done correctly, the actual playbook should just be a list of machines and/or groups and roles. The meat should be separated into individual roles

[22:35:04] <jhutchins> MrCollinsGA: There are a number of other methods such as vnc and rdp.  If your client machine is Windows, rdp is a good place to start.
[22:35:04] <gordonjcp> MrCollinsGA: there's no point having X on a server

[22:35:32] <gordonjcp> like, what problem does this solve?
[22:35:48] <jhutchins> MrCollinsGA: Another option is to learn proper console management.  Nothing ubuntu runs as a service should need a GUI to manage.
[22:36:03] <MrCollinsGA> I am encoding video files, and I want these machines I have setup as encoders for video files so I can encode many at once
[22:36:27] <jhutchins> MrCollinsGA: This does not require a GUI.
[22:36:32] <MrCollinsGA> many different files
[22:36:47] <jhutchins> MrCollinsGA: Most of the large encoding/transcoding farms that Hollywood uses are pure text.
[22:36:55] <gordonjcp> MrCollinsGA: you don't need a GUI for that at all
[22:36:56] <MrCollinsGA> ok.
[22:37:02] <gordonjcp> MrCollinsGA: what are you encoding with?
[22:37:21] <MrCollinsGA> what is my best option for this? I am encoding with Open Shot a free video editor/decoder
[22:37:55] <MrCollinsGA> by the way thank you for everyones input. greatly appreciated
[22:37:56] <leftyfb> funny thing, I bet ansible could be used if you needed to manually kick off encoding applications on each of the machines. That said, I bet this could all be automated with some file shares and watchers running on the machines
[22:38:19] <leftyfb> MrCollinsGA: openshot just uses command line tools in the background
[22:38:21] <MrCollinsGA> leftyfb, yes I would love to set this up please
[22:38:25] <gordonjcp> incidentally, you don't even need a GUI even if you're using hardware-accelerated ffmpeg
[22:38:34] <gordonjcp> MrCollinsGA: ffmpeg
[22:38:51] <gordonjcp> MrCollinsGA: it's a bit of a headnip to figure out at first but very soon you'll wonder how you ever coped with anything else

[22:40:56] <MrCollinsGA> My idea was: create the video, its on a nfs share. then ubuntu desktop run openshot and just simply encode the file and it copies it back to the nfs share then I can upload
[22:41:05] <gordonjcp> okay
[22:41:06] <MrCollinsGA> davinci resolve ok
[22:41:07] <gordonjcp> that could work

[23:15:53] <tomreyn> Kexoni:  it's important to install ubuntu (i.e. boot and run the installer) in the same boot mode (UEFI or legacy BIOS) as your windows installation uses.
[23:16:15] <tomreyn> windows probably uses uefi mode, so make sure you boot the ubuntu installer in uefi mode as well.
[23:16:16] <Kexoni> Windows use UEFI...

[23:17:01] <Kexoni> yes, I set only to UEFI in BIOS, and tried install couple of times
[23:17:01] <tomreyn> when you booted the ubuntu installer, you can open a terminal window by pressing ctrl-alt-t. typing this will tell you how you booted:
[23:17:04] <tomreyn> echo -n 'This system booted via: '; [ -d /sys/firmware/efi ] && echo UEFI || echo BIOS
[23:18:03] <Kexoni> thanks, I will try another install in a few minutes
[23:18:10] <tomreyn> this could also be something specific to your system / hardware + firmware, so if you can provide more details on this, this could also help
[23:18:26] <tomreyn> journalctl -b | grep DMI:     would tell us about your hardware
[23:18:27] <Kexoni> I am using Lenovo b51 80
[23:18:57] <tomreyn> consider a bios upgrade, too, since those *can* resolve such incompatibilities.
[23:19:22] <Kexoni> tried BIOS upgrade, I am using latest version

[23:22:51] <Kexoni> tomreyn, what should I choose for "device for boot loader installation", I saw many suggestions in forums, some say it should be sda, some say that it shoud be where is efi (sda1) windows boot manager...

[23:25:15] <tomreyn> Kexoni: if you're using the default ubuntu desktop installer and doing an uefi installation, then it does not matter what you choose there, it will be ignored, and the installation will be attempted on the first efy system partition
[23:25:37] <tomreyn> *efi system partition
