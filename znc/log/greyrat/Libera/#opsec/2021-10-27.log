[00:47:16] <mooff> hey hey :-)
[00:48:27] <mooff> > On a positive note I just figured out how to make a combobox spin using arrow keys..
[00:48:55] <mooff> you mean like one of those dickybows people flick to spin round and round?

[02:22:48] <jan6> ooh, noice
[02:22:58] <jan6> how you do that
[02:23:48] <Joanna> You have to use a timer that is enabled Inside the keydown event.
[02:24:58] <Joanna> And logic detecting the boundary condition of arrow key at end/beginning of the items list
[02:26:09] <Joanna> And a class variable for the case statement inside the timer event procedure
[02:27:52] <jan6> sounds horribly complicated
[02:30:10] <mooff> oh god
[02:30:14] <mooff> why is a timer needed?
[02:31:18] <jan6> probably would trigger immediately when switching to last element, I assume
[02:31:25] <jan6> or something?
[02:32:32] <Joanna> A timer is required because it can’t change the index inside the keydown event . Well the index will change but the combobox will not change what is at top.
[02:35:10] <Joanna> jan6: if the down arrow is pressed it checks if the index is count -1 and if so it sets the string variable to ‘spin’ at the bottom of the procedure I set timer.enabled to (stringvariable  <> ‘’)
[02:37:26] <Joanna> The default behavior of timer event is to close the combobox
[02:37:59] <Joanna> Actually this is for a checkcombobox which makes it more complicated

[04:12:19] <vaio> not sure if this is on topic, but heh... im just wondering
[04:12:43] <vaio> dunno. Are you locked down, avoiding seeing people ?

Bellovin, Josh Benaloh, Matt Blaze, Jon Callas, Whitfield Diffie, Susan Landau, Peter G. Neumann, Ronald L. Rivest, Jeffrey I. Schiller, Bruce Schneier, Vanessa Teague, Carmela Troncoso
[14:22:36] <shibboleth> remember how between iphone1/2g, later droid and up until much later every app had access to the gallery without asking? this already happened...
[14:23:29] <jan6> even more these days, nobody cares about permissions, and everyone's just accept-accept-accept-ok-install-already
[14:23:30] <jan6> lol
[14:25:18] <jan6> also I think I read or watched a video or something, about that exact topic, some time ago
[14:25:48] <jan6> the main problem is that anyone can fake the stuff, to frame someone else for "illegal material"
[14:26:51] <shibboleth> yeah, dark pattern/pop-up fatigue
[14:27:29] <jan6> you can tweak a meme picture to trigger the AI filter's CP trigger, for example, which would be especially useful for them if they want to search someone's device, they'll just arrange a triggering file, and have all the justification why they must be given full access to all your files
[14:27:46] <jan6> adversarial patterns and whatnot
[14:28:51] <jan6> like "pig" -> "airliner" with just a bit of noise, https://pic1.zhimg.com/v2-e16fe3dcf69a0effda4cb159eb6148f2_1440w.jpg?source=172ae18b
[14:29:19] <shibboleth> jan6, yeah, once you get perpwalked down your own driveway for suspected CP... sure, the neighbors will totally let it go even if it doesn't end in a conviction
[14:29:50] <jan6> yeah, even if they then fully clear you "well, looks like our bad" the reputation damage will still be there
[14:30:27] *** Joins: inky (~inky@188.115.231.67)
[14:32:11] <jan6> the real privacy-concious people would just start using encrypted vaults (a la veracrypt) with apps that support reading without needing to store an unencrypted copy
[14:32:46] <jan6> there already is one such app, that can hold a "vault" of sorts, without root, with the flaw that because it doesn't use root, only that one app itself can access the contents
[14:34:08] <jan6> that on-device filter's only gonna give people control, not actually trouble anyone with some level of awareness
[14:35:52] <shibboleth> well, you don't get to do stuff like that on ios. and securing your droid? right
[14:36:02] <jan6> lol
[14:36:23] <jan6> ios isn't even worth talking about, although I'm pretty sure technically you could do the same there
[14:37:11] <jan6> because after all, you'd just have one all-in-one app with access to a file or folder somewhere
[14:38:41] <shibboleth> i'm just guessing here, but i have this odd feeling apple don't allow "custom crypto". that they force the use of their apis for... "optimization/hwaccel/battery-life"
[14:39:12] <jan6> I kinda doubt that, but wouldn't be too surprised either
[14:40:02] <jan6> most, if not all, phones have a sort of TPM module, anyway, these days, so wouldn't be surprising if apple forced you to use it
[14:40:27] <shibboleth> jan6, well, then how does a vuln in imessage ext parsing let you peruse the signal localstore?
[14:40:32] <shibboleth> food for thought
[14:40:38] <shibboleth> text parsing
[14:41:07] <jan6> imessage is apple-system app, so might just have system priviledges
[14:41:24] <jan6> but sure
[14:41:30] <jan6> anything's possible
[14:41:36] <shibboleth> you, and everything on ios ios basically a wrapper around ios core/system services

[17:21:54] <JimBuntu> irclf (internet relay chat long format)... Laughing out loud.
[17:22:55] <JimBuntu> no more contractions either, that is for the wicked ;)
[17:23:28] <tangy> since this is #opsec, I was watching yesterday's senate rule committe testimony about how election workers are getting some particularly nasty death threats...
[17:23:28] <jan6> ;) is a contraction of ;-)
[17:23:42] * JimBuntu bans self.
[17:24:05] <tangy> and I was wondering, is there a way for people to keep their residential address private even from data brokers?
[17:24:12] <JimBuntu> tangy, I have not been paying attention, are LEOs considering them credible?
[17:25:01] <jan6> you can keep your address private if you're not TECHNICALLY the owner of the place, most likely
[17:25:09] <JimBuntu> I think it depends on the jurisdiction/area (like USA vs England vs. Australia), but I can't think of a good way to keep it private unless you start off at that address with this in mind.
[17:25:53] <JimBuntu> Some government forms require an address and once your data is in the hands of the government it's hard to control who has legal access, let alone illegal access
[17:25:57] <tangy> JimBuntu - well, the sanate testimony that I saw didn't speak directly on that question, but if 10-15 senators are spending time on it, I'd assume so
[17:27:42] <JimBuntu> I think the best and possibly the only way to protect your address would be to go for misinformation instead of no information, meaning... put a false address down anywhere that you can't put a P.O. box or such.  Could also rent a room/apartment/etc if money and access to physical mail isn't an issue.
[17:27:54] <jan6> there's always the option of having one legal address you have access to, but don't live at, and another you live at, but aren't exactly written in as living at, which may technically not be legal, but who cares, nobody checks anyway
[17:28:36] <tangy> but anyhow, it seems to me like owning or renting any premises for any use, including residential, would be to do so as some sort of a private corporation...
[17:29:01] <tangy> oh, yes, that makes sense
[17:29:41] <JimBuntu> I would also think that having misinformation easily available would probably prevent a lot of people from even looking further.
[17:30:04] <jan6> access to as in, like a friend of family member maybe, so that if someone sends mail there for example, you can get it, and whatnot
[17:30:27] <jan6> and if someone asks "does X live here" they won't be "wait, who's X?"
[17:30:37] <JimBuntu> yeah, because you can't trust on a normal mail forwarding request since that yet again puts your info out there
[17:32:14] <tangy> I just feel sad for the elcetion workers
[17:32:35] <tangy> on the other hand, elections offices are probably hiring
[17:32:37] <JimBuntu> I feel sad for any of them who are properly innocent ;)

[17:36:00] <tangy> is there anyone who isn't both innocent and guilty at the same time, I wonder
[17:36:23] *** Joins: sn1tch3r (~sn1tch3r@user/sn1tch3r)
[17:38:23] <JimBuntu> :)  I mean innocent of the complaints against them drawing the threats
[17:39:41] <tangy> "why would you need privacy if you don't have anything to hide?" is a question I've heard a number of times. 
[17:39:54] <JimBuntu> I'll feel bad for probably any of them where the threats materialize because outside of self defense I prefer law/order/justice compared to vigilantism
[17:40:28] <JimBuntu> Yeah, I think the 'nothing to hide, no reason to hide' concept is inherently flawed.
[17:41:09] <JimBuntu> Especially today... if you so much as look like someone who did something bad then people might come after you.
[17:43:00] <tangy> cars can be so recognizeable. it would be pretty awkward to, for instance have to walk or bike everywhere to like hit the dating scene but still keep your home address a secret.
[17:43:28] <JimBuntu> rentals or uber/lyft/etc.
[17:43:36] <jan6> lol yeah, rental cars are a thing
[17:43:57] <jan6> also you can often park somewhere that is not next to your home
[17:45:24] <JimBuntu> Of course, if someone is really worried about being followed tracked, they'll need 360 dashcam views or nearly 360 and time to review each day.  Proper tailing/tracking techniques are not obvious.
[17:45:57] <tangy> yes. yes, that is true
[17:48:22] <tangy> how effective might t be, when receiving an anonymous text message such as, 'boo! I'm gonna murderders your childrenses!,' to respons with something like, "dear golem, sue me. thanks, tangy." ?
[17:48:34] <JimBuntu> lolz
[17:49:42] <JimBuntu> or maybe something more like... "those childrenses are not childrenses, they are golems"
[17:49:59] <JimBuntu> I don't know about you, but I aint messing with no golems.
[17:51:13] <tangy> 'well, buddy, I'l tell ya, my kids? are ferocious. me and the Mrs, really, you'd be doin' us a favor!'
[17:51:31] <JimBuntu> Dang it, someone already has http://www.avrakdavra.com/

[18:08:55] <jessicara> yeah that so much as looking at someone who did something bad and they will come after you
[18:09:07] <jessicara> it's not hard to imagine what is "bad" changing and putting a lot of people in trouble
[18:13:44] <jan6> inb4 "they have a linux phone" is a reason for arrest
[18:15:22] <JimBuntu> I was thinking more like looks like Brian Laundrie or that Kyle kid.
[18:24:15] <Joanna> There is another way to hide your address not mentioned above and that is to use a proxy or business to rent your address and pay the utility bills necessary for the address.
[18:26:25] <Joanna> For common folks though it’s hard to hide address without either becoming homeless or living with someone else who has name on all the bills
[18:26:42] <JimBuntu> We should all start setting up shell businesses ;) 
[18:27:34] <JimBuntu> Use one of those nomad/traveler services where it's a private entity who can drrop-ship your mail wherever you want on an ever-changing schedule
[18:28:40] <Joanna> Over the years the government has made it harder and harder to have privacy. For instance even if you have a legal entity with its own tax ID number banks still want your details and a physical address which for the time being is not verified.
[18:29:25] <Joanna> JimBuntu: do you really want people able to snoop your mail though?
[18:30:55] <Joanna> A lot of things are paperless now the only problem is actual cards . You can change your address after you get them I suppose.
[18:32:23] <JimBuntu> I wouldn't want someone to snoop on my mail, but I wouldn't see it as being much different from the multitude of people who already touch that same mail.
[18:34:12] <Joanna> I think privacy I’d definitely hard to come by. I’ve been hiding my real address for a long time even from my relatives.
[18:34:21] <jan6> lets just go back to ye olde seals on mails ;P
[18:34:42] <JimBuntu> cloth envelopes with wax seals :)
[18:34:50] <jan6> lol yeah
[18:34:59] <jan6> everything can be faked anyway, with sufficient effort
[18:35:30] <jan6> question is at which point is it too much effort to be worth it
[18:36:14] <Joanna>   There are several things that will get your address disseminated to data brokers super fast .. change of address, voter registration, public records.
[18:37:32] <Joanna> They have been trying to privatize public records so ordinary folks can’t access them but data brokers sure can.
[18:37:57] <jan6> just don't live in US, Australia, or other areas that are heavily tracked, is the easiest answer ;P
[18:40:39] <Joanna> jan6: are you in Scandinavia?
[18:40:53] <jan6> Estonia, so not far
[18:43:10] <Joanna> I’ve been watching people willing give up their privacy for decades which has facilitated the current situation. It is simply easier to obey without thinking in most cases so that’s exactly what people do.
[18:43:56] <Joanna> You shouldn’t give some you don’t want in your house your address really.
[18:44:51] <jan6> yes, although you might need to give a residential address to recieve stuff from places like banks
[18:46:19] <Joanna> Post office box works well but you have to move after you get the post office box and not tell them. They have really been cracking down in recent years on that and demanding proof of address.
[18:47:08] <Joanna> I know nothing about how things work in Estonia I’m only familiar with the us.
