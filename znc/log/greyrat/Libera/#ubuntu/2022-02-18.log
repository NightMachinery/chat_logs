[00:11:08] <rdz> oerheks, according to Xorg.log i have 10 bit enabled and icons in file browser are all black... however the gradients still show steps.. so maybe there is another bitdepth bottleneck than the display.. anyway, you already helped a lot. thanks

[00:11:33] <oerheks> you don't like snaps? change distro
[00:11:55] <rdz> why changing distro? i disabled snaps and didn't miss anything yet

[01:49:06] <Chunkyz> enyc, I'm not *modding* them.
[01:49:15] <enyc> most likely you have a bad image write,  maybe an existing FS was auto-mounted before writing with dd ?
[01:49:25] <Chunkyz> nah that's not it.
[01:49:37] <sarnold> did you disable windows fast boot?
[01:49:51] <enyc> sarnold: oooo good point
[01:50:01] <Chunkyz> yeah
[01:50:21] <enyc> Chunkyz: fwiw dual booting can be pain, virtualizing windows can be better, boot can get messed up later etc etc ;/
[01:50:38] <sarnold> I've heard about various machines making it very hard to actually change the boot order

[01:51:26] <cbreak> apparently there's an open ticket about it for years and it hasn't been fixed
[01:51:31] <cbreak> but I don't think that's the problem here
[01:51:35] <enyc> Chunkyz: I'd be tempted to compare with few different images  e.g. try  different ubuntu image versions,   mint 20.3 (ubuntu derivative)  and  MXLinux-21  (a good debian XFCE distro)  ...  see if you get same issues or not ...  imho
[01:51:47] <enyc> start narrowing down combination of issuse

[02:14:07] <jhutchins> Actually, the question of whether you can boot an installer or live image has nothing to do with dual-boot, that's a question for how you configure it when the installer is running.
[02:15:39] <enyc> jhutchins: I was aware rufus can tend to  try to make images hdd-bootable, and all that... when ubuntu images are already  BIOS CD-no-emulation-boot + BIOS mbr/ptbl boot + UEFI boot  all in one carefully pre-arranged
[02:15:55] <enyc> jhutchins: and also that dd'ing can easily go wrong due to partition being automounted already

[05:48:05] <ke4nhw> I have a question. I am having to consider another distribution for a business environment: my stepson is going to start a small business, an RV park. He will be providing internet (both wifi and wired) to his clients. So I need a rock-solid Linux distro for servers: host and vm. How much is it likely to cost to do this with Ubuntu, and is Ubuntu capable of doing such work (I prefer kvm for
[05:48:05] <ke4nhw> virtuals).
[05:48:46] <sarnold> heya ke4nhw :) you can use ubuntu lts for free if you wish
[05:49:03] <ke4nhw> ubunbu lts?
[05:49:16] <ke4nhw> Is that a lightweight version of ubuntu?
[05:49:59] <sarnold> ke4nhw: ubuntu is released every six months, and most are supported for nine months. every two years, in april, there's a new "long term support" release that has five years support, with an additional five years of "esm" support available for subscription..
[05:51:00] <sarnold> ke4nhw: the vast majority of people run the LTS releases, since they get the most bug fixing focus, the most third-party application support, and are pretty predictable
[05:51:27] <ke4nhw> so it would have a life cycle similar to Fedora, based on subscription?
[05:51:49] <ke4nhw> Or does the subscription just extend the life cycle from 5 to 10 years?
[05:52:14] <ke4nhw> And what is esm support?

[05:52:53] <ke4nhw> That's okay lol
[05:53:06] <sarnold> esm == extended security (and?) maintenance -- it's mostly security support after the free basic support ends, yeah
[05:53:28] <sarnold> it's not *exactly* for money, you can get three machines of esm for free, https://ubuntu.com/advantage
[05:54:13] <sarnold> but if you're talking a dozen machines, or a dozen VMs, and you want them to still get security support after five years, it'll cost a bit per machine, yeah
[05:54:34] <ke4nhw> So I can 5 years for free, then either upgrade or subscribe to continue support for the current version?
[05:54:57] <ke4nhw> Probably not a dozen, but I'd expect at least half a dozen...
[05:54:58] <sarnold> quite a lot of folks will just upgrade every two years, and either run the newest LTS release, or the "previous LTS" release
[05:55:20] <sarnold> but a lot of businesses run on slower cycles than that :)

[06:13:28] <ke4nhw> 4 years would be an acceptable cycle. So, does the long term support, the two year model, just run behind the 6 month distribution? Is this similar to Fedora/Centos/RedHat layout, where Fedora updates frequently, yet by time it distills down to RedHat it's running slightly behind, but it's much more stable since it's tested by that point?
[06:14:02] <sarnold> ke4nhw: I've got a 16.04 VM, two 18.04 machines, three 20.04 machines; the 16.04 is on a free ESM plan, the others are still in standard support. one of these days I'll re-standardize everything, probably a bit after 22.04 is out
[06:15:40] <sarnold> ke4nhw: the LTS releases are cut from the exactly the same stream of packages as the "interim" releases -- the development release is constantly importing packages from debian unstable, until some point in the release cycle that process is stopped
[06:15:56] <sarnold> ke4nhw: debian unstable still keeps churning along at whatever rate it churns at, in the meantime

[06:19:34] <ke4nhw> So Debian is an unstable distribution, or is 'debian unstable' a testbed platform, similar to Fedora? Is Debian the testbed for Ubuntu, or is it a separate distro altogether?
[06:22:17] <sarnold> debian is a separate distribution altogether; debian unstable is a bit like a rolling release, every year or two or three they stablize for a bit and focus on interoperability and bug fixes and so on and then make a new stable release, and then go back to uploading new versions of packages to unstable whenever it's convenient
[06:23:08] <sarnold> ubuntu builds on the unstable releases, and puts some predictability to the releases -- every six months -- with the intention of trying to make sure the changes along the way make sense together, that upstream application authors get feedback from releases more often, etc
[06:23:50] <sarnold> so, ubuntu does some 'real world' testing of packages before those packages are released in a debian stable

[08:33:23] <adderall> Yeah, I can even find the process causing it to hang
[08:34:02] <adderall> ... Looks like it's the full snap directory doing this
[08:34:07] <adderall> Could just disable snap at boot
[08:34:38] <ke4nhw> I don't know enough about ubuntu to even hazard a guess.
[08:36:36] <adderall> Well, the snap issue isn't just an Ubuntu thing. You can install snap on any linux
[08:37:00] *** Quits: greknod (~grek@120.88.171.98) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[08:37:18] <adderall> It just makes it easier to install certain packages and I find that with snap, the icons and gui features are nicer. But it does slow things down considerably
[08:37:24] <ke4nhw> Holy mother of God, I am seeing things in the Ubuntu pricing list in the $200,000/yr price range???? Um, yeah, ubuntu might just be too rich for my blood
[08:38:00] <ke4nhw> I haven't heard of it, and doesn't sound like I want to try it lol
[08:38:04] <KBar> ? Ubuntu is 100% free.
[08:38:31] <ke4nhw> I was looking at things under the enterprise/business pages
[08:39:05] <adderall> I'm not even sure what that means: Ubuntu is not free ... it's open source and free to install. This gets into the political arguments of what free software is, relating to GNU and Richard Stallman
[08:39:19] <adderall> I'm going to say it's free as in it doesn't cost $120, as compared to Windows
[08:39:31] <KBar> adderall: regardless of what he thinks, it's absolutely free in both meanings
[08:39:43] <adderall> I agree with KBar
[08:39:53] <KBar> you can get it for exactly 0 cents and do whatever you want with it
[08:40:01] <adderall> It's free enough. You don't have to pay for it. It used to come with Amazon on the desktop but Canonical quit doing that.
[08:40:02] <ke4nhw> And one reason I am considering ubuntu is for a busisness. Not mine, my stepson, it'll be a small business, but I don't need him getting hit with a "you're using this in a place that makes money so it violates the license agreement". Literally the same thing I nearly walked into before now
[08:40:19] <KBar> get rid of most the packages, install something else, etc.
[08:40:35] <adderall> What country are you in, ke4nhw? Just curious as it's very rare for business owners to use Linux in the U.S.
[08:40:42] <adderall> I'm interested in the idea of that! Very cool
[08:40:49] <adderall> It's mostly just used for servers here
[08:41:15] <ke4nhw> My idea of free is "can I use this at home, in a small business, or whatever, free of charge, without having a massive lawsuit. I'm here in the US, and this is for servers.
[08:41:21] <KBar> adderall: i heard ts pretty popular in SEA for kiosks?
[08:41:22] <adderall> Yep, haha, it's free
[08:41:34] <adderall> I'm sure it's used for cash registers in the U.S.
[08:41:44] <ke4nhw> He'll be using Windows on his desk of course, but backend stuff will be on Linux servers.
[08:41:57] <adderall> I noticed at Target that they were running Linux on the registers. I got super excited. My wife and father-in-law didn't care though, LOL
