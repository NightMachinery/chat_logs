[02:53:21] <enterprisey> poll for the room: a chat app sorts chats by last activity. does "activity" mean messages only or does it mean people joining/leaving
[02:53:28] <enterprisey> what about when the room name/topic changes
[02:53:31] <enterprisey> (it's Matrix)
[02:53:44] <enterprisey> I would think it's just messages, and maybe also when important events like the room name changing occur
[02:54:05] <c355e3b> I think doing it off everything except for threads/joins/leaves makes sense
[02:56:06] <enterprisey> excluding name/avatar changes, too, I'd assume?
[02:57:03] <enterprisey> hmm, there sure are a lot of matrix event types

[16:28:28] <kline> companion_cube, dunno, given their aims it sounds like this could well be a good move
[16:28:58] <iDrougge> It's just for the CLI, isn't it?
[16:29:16] <iDrougge> Still stupid, but that describes the entire endavour, doesn't it?
[16:31:16] <companion_cube> kline: why even have typescript then
[16:33:17] <kline> options
[16:33:32] <wink> it's one alias away. seems fine
[16:33:34] <kline> it gives you optional typechecking if, when, and where you want it, i suppose
[16:33:48] <wink> I don't understand why it needs to be a diff. default though
[16:34:10] <companion_cube> it's just stupid
[16:34:16] <companion_cube> if you don't want typechecking, use .js files
[16:35:27] <maskd> with this you still get type checking in the editor via the language server
[16:35:38] <companion_cube> which is not enough, what if some files are not open in the editor
[16:36:40] <maskd> well it is if you do the type-checking in CI
[16:36:46] <iDrougge> I thought they meant "REPL" when they wrote "CLI".
[16:36:48] <ignaloidas> people don't write proper typescript though
[16:36:54] <wink> the ide argument is really stupid
[16:37:03] <wink> the rest is a matter of preference

[16:39:26] <maskd> that's also kind of how I use typescript, I generally just rely on my editor but I also have a pre-push hook that runs tsc and eslint
[16:40:14] <kline> not pre-commit?
[16:40:43] <kline> or do you do things like squash before pushes
[16:41:33] <maskd> yeah I usually do a fair amount of cleanup before pushing
[16:42:30] <maskd> I don't have it as a pre-commit hook because it takes like 2min to run
[16:43:11] <companion_cube> oh well, it does mean this is really not for me

[16:43:58] <ignaloidas> in misskey tsc returns 500 errors and that is considered to be normal
[16:44:15] <ignaloidas> typescript is more of a suggestion for a bunch of people
[16:45:03] <kline> maskd, the only reason i mention is because it get that some people have broken commits in history where they are working towards the solution, and when they get there they push so that HEAD is the working bit with some broken commits in the past that might be historically interesting
[16:45:25] <kline> but failing checks etc will break stuff like bisect :(
[16:45:55] *** Joins: pyrorock (~Dont@46.136.247.98)

[16:49:09] <ngoldbaum> seems like a bad deal for typescript that typechecking is so slow
[16:50:01] <iDrougge> Seems like a bad deal for computing as an industry.
[16:50:22] <companion_cube> it's because it's just fucking hard to check :D
[16:50:33] <companion_cube> (because it has to accomodate for all the js crazyness)

[16:51:51] <wink> *valid Js be
[16:51:53] <iDrougge> It's funny that later editions of JS introduced something called "use strict" which is included in the head of every JS file written the last five years, but all it does is fix two or three minor things in JS.
[16:51:57] <iDrougge> Great missed opportunity.
[16:52:35] <companion_cube> maybe if it was stricter, it wouldn't be in every file
[16:53:07] <iDrougge> "This language would be perfect if we just made these three things stricter"
[16:53:31] <iDrougge> If you need more strictness, just use more equals signs.
[16:53:58] <companion_cube> they also couldn't break compatibility
[16:54:55] <iDrougge> No, of course not. That would have broken JS support in all the hundreds of browsers modern web developers target.
[16:55:48] <companion_cube> you joke, but it'd have broken millions of websites
[16:55:53] <companion_cube> not a handful of browsers

[16:57:02] <iDrougge> Why? If you don't start your file with "use strict", the implementation defaults to legacy mode.
[16:57:26] <maskd> I wonder if the fact that tsc is made to work well with the language server has performance implications when used as a standalone compiler
[16:57:42] <companion_cube> hmm, iDrougge, I supposed you meant changing the meaning of `==` for example
[16:58:00] <companion_cube> that seems quite surprising as a change if all it  takes is `use strict`

[16:59:04] <iDrougge> I'm personally not of the kind that really mind the fuzzy equality behaviour of JS, considering all the other warts of the language.
[16:59:24] <iDrougge> What I do mind is that every equals operation written in modern JS uses three equals.
[16:59:31] <companion_cube> I'm honestly not that familiar with the other warts
[16:59:44] <companion_cube> the `.bind` stuff seems awfully weird, but otherwise?
[17:00:40] <epilys> have you watched the "wat?" series?
[17:01:02] <cot> https://bhh.sh/wat.jpg
[17:01:02] <iDrougge> Awful syntax, too many type promotions/coercions/conversions, layers of discarded syntaxes.
[17:01:17] <companion_cube> syntax is just "meh" imho
[17:01:25] <companion_cube> not worst than a lot of other languages
[17:01:36] <companion_cube> (the arrow functions are definitely an improvement)
[17:02:02] <epilys> https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat
[17:02:15] <iDrougge> The arrow functions are a typical example of bad syntax. So now you have >= and => where one is a comparison and one is a function.
[17:02:27] <iDrougge> Not to mention that => and function have different syntaxes.
[17:02:47] <iDrougge> Sorry, not syntaxes, but different behaviours regarding constness.
[17:02:58] <companion_cube> otoh it provides a convenient syntax for lambdas
[17:03:12] <companion_cube> as in, concise
[17:03:23] <iDrougge> You could have an equally convenient syntax for lambdas that didn't look like a comparison.
[17:03:35] <cot> like |args| {}?
[17:03:53] <iDrougge> I don't consider that elegant or convenient, but at least it stands out.
[17:04:33] <iDrougge> And even though JS does its best to promote an array into a number and so forth, it just dies on you if it ever encounters a null value.
[17:05:05] <iDrougge> Or null's ugly cousin, undefined. Better guard against both, but without any such affordances.
[17:05:52] <companion_cube> what would you consider elegant?
[17:06:14] <companion_cube> (yeah well, all dynamic languages are plaggued by nil/null/…)
[17:06:23] <companion_cube> (one of the big benefits of TS)
[17:06:40] <iDrougge> All dynamic languages are not plagued by nil/null.
[17:07:59] <companion_cube> which one isn't?
[17:08:03] <companion_cube> (hmm, prolog?)
[17:08:07] <prussian> uh, awk i guess?
[17:08:12] <prussian> lol
[17:08:23] <iDrougge> REXX can't even express a nil value.
[17:08:31] <prussian> who needs null/undefined? just make everything "" or 0 when coerced
[17:08:41] <companion_cube> :D ok, never heard of rexx
[17:09:09] <iDrougge> That's fine, you're not designing a language. If you do that and only go by what you know, you invent Java and Javascript.
[17:09:24] <companion_cube> if I were designing a language it wouldn't be dynamic anyway
[17:10:15] <prussian> If I were to design a language right now, it'd just be a pure stack lang because I am too lazy to parse anything.
[17:10:20] <iDrougge> Just changing => to → would be an improvement. Just don't make it look like a comparison operator – especially not in a language that is predominantly used by geeks.

[17:11:25] <companion_cube> => is implication, at worst, not comparison
[17:11:50] <prussian> not -> ?
[17:12:07] <companion_cube> -> for me is type arrow
[17:12:08] <prussian> oh. I guess I'm seeing where this is going
[17:12:14] <shapr> where? -> way?
[17:12:15] <companion_cube> (some people would see both as the same thing, but well)
[17:12:22] <iDrougge> prussian: Yes, that is less similar to >=.
[17:12:25] <prussian> => is fine with me honestly
[17:12:30] <companion_cube> with me too
[17:12:38] <shapr> what about >>= ?
[17:12:43] <companion_cube> :D
[17:12:45] <prussian> I mean I can see the ambiguity with another like binary operator
[17:12:47] <prussian> but really.
[17:12:59] <prussian> shapr: I'd just use `do` instead
[17:13:05] <iDrougge> It's not about what is fine, it's about thinking just a little bit more before settling on "fine".
[17:13:19] <prussian> people expect => to be "fat arrow"
[17:13:20] <companion_cube> x -> x+1 would have been slightly better maybe
[17:13:21] <prussian> I mean really
[17:13:25] <companion_cube> not even sure
[17:13:39] <prussian> it is "fine" insofar that that's the way the syntax has been decided by most

[18:35:00] <southclaws> Go does not have =>
[18:35:02] <rwb> though my go is very very rusty
[18:35:08] <southclaws> the syntax is `func (args) return { body }`

[18:35:56] <southclaws> favourite language, despite the shortcomings
[18:36:05] <companion_cube> honestly generics won't make FP more possible, I think
[18:36:11] <companion_cube> but it might make concurrency better?
[18:36:32] <southclaws> it'll make some FP things easier
