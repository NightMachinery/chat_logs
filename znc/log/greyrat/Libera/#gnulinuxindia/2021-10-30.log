[20:02:38] <Arya[m]> <irc-open-up> "lets bridge back telegram Arya..." <- spam problem has been fixed?
[20:06:20] <Arya[m]> Will Odysee be Open Source?
[20:06:20] <Arya[m]> > Odysee has chosen to continue to release code in an open->source fashion. However, Odysee is not bound to do this, and >does not promise to do this.
[20:06:20] <Arya[m]> rip

[20:06:45] <Arya[m]> odysee is also adding ads ‚òπÔ∏è https://odysee.com/@Odysee:8/creator-earnings:7
[20:12:45] <Mudskipper875[m]> I don't think it matters if odysee is open source or not... As long as they don't start censoring stuff it's okay..
[20:12:56] <Mudskipper875[m]> Youtube needs competition
[20:13:04] <Arya[m]> lol
[20:13:12] <Mudskipper875[m]> If we need FOSS, theres always peertube
[20:13:26] <Arya[m]> ys but self host ‚òπÔ∏è

[20:14:32] <irc-open-up> muxh better situation than it was earlier
[20:14:36] <irc-open-up> much*
[20:17:04] <Mudskipper875[m]> <Arya[m]> "odysee is also adding ads..." <- I follow odysee channels via RSS and watch in mpv, so no ads for me üòù
[20:17:24] <irc-open-up> Mudskipper875[m]: niiiiice

[20:29:31] <Arya[m]> its not adding lol
[20:36:13] <Arya[m]> I will try different implementation
[20:36:31] <Arya[m]> irc-open-up: you have to invite @tchncs_bot on tg
[20:36:45] *** Joins: Telegrambridgebo (~telegramb@2001:470:69fc:105::c54)
[20:36:52] -Telegrambridgebo- Hello, I'm a Telegram bridge bot. Use `!tg help` for help.
[20:38:02] <Arya[m]> >On the Telegram-side, invite @tchncs_bot
[20:38:02] <Arya[m]> Obtain the room-id, using the command /id
[20:38:02] <Arya[m]> On the Matrix-side, invite @telegrambot:tchncs.de
[20:38:02] <Arya[m]> Create the portal using the !tg bridge mynewid command
[20:45:54] <irc-open-up> Arya[m]: no direct bridge for irc client, this will reroute to matrix
[20:50:52] <Arya[m]> ya
[20:51:03] <Arya[m]> thats what prev bridge did
[20:51:24] <Arya[m]> irc -> matrix which would forward the msgs from irc & matrix -> tg
[20:51:45] <Arya[m]>  they use the same underlying server
[20:58:41] <irc-open-up> thats in effiecient
[20:58:49] <irc-open-up> thats ineffiecient
[20:59:18] <irc-open-up> then why not go with the previous bridge
[20:59:20] <Arya[m]> bridging to telegram is harder
[20:59:27] <Arya[m]> they are the same
[20:59:38] <Arya[m]> but the old one isnt getting in for some reason
[20:59:49] <Arya[m]> Arya[m]: directly from irc
[21:01:00] <irc-open-up> Arya[m]: 
[21:01:02] <irc-open-up> ok
[21:01:23] <irc-open-up> Arya[m]: you do the matrix thing , ok?
[21:02:04] <irc-open-up> ok bot is removing him
