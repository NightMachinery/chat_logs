[00:16:45] <halosghost> `find` also probably takes the cake in terms of a CLI program that requires the most shell-keyword-escaping
[00:16:47] <cvmn> why is P=NP related whether CSPRNGs exist?
[00:17:19] <halosghost> cvmn: I assume it's a descendant on whether or not one-way functions exist
[00:18:18] <halosghost> if one-way functions don't exist, then cryptography in-general is in trouble
[00:18:43] <yawkat> if P=NP, you can simply try all seeds in polynomial time to find out which one your CSPRNG is using.
[00:19:17] <cvmn> but how much CSPRNG output would the adversary need?
[00:19:30] <yawkat> polynomial
[00:20:19] <cvmn> polynomial output per information gain about the seed?
[00:22:18] <yawkat> please just learn the definitions
[00:26:27] <cvmn> you mean that this f is a polynomial function?  f(reveal_x_seed_bits) = number_of_outputs_required_to_read

[04:35:42] <caveman> i see why P=NP means that csprng/hash/symmetric ciphers can't exist.  but i don't see the opposite:  if there is no csprng/hash/symmetric ciphers, why would it mean that P=NP?  e.g. why can't we say ``maybe those csprng/hash/symmetric ciphers are bad, but maybe there is other algorithms where P != NP''?
[04:36:26] <caveman> to rephrase:  by ``if there is no csprng/hash/symmetric ciphers'', i mean:  those that we know so far are cracked badly (solved fully in polynomial time).

[13:10:30] <maroon> pulseaudio, it looks like the longest of the rsa challenges won is the 250/829
[13:10:57] <maroon> but that's only public, so we don't know what can be accomplished by secret efforts
[13:14:12] <pulseaudio> why don't people try ? It also got a cash prize
[13:14:34] <piou> it doesn't have a cash prize anymore, and trying costs money
[13:15:11] <pulseaudio> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_Factoring_Challenge
[13:15:19] <pulseaudio> cash prize is there for some
[13:16:40] <piou> pulseaudio: on that page you can read that the challenge was stopped in2007 and that "no further prizes will be awarded for factoring the higher numbers"
[13:17:33] <piou> the prize money in yellow indicate the amount that was offered, but that the challenge ended before it was claimed
[13:17:58] <pulseaudio> do you think RSA maybe cracked someday ?
[13:18:20] <pulseaudio> or is it like time machine = not possible
[13:19:16] <piou> of course, in a way it's already been cracked theoretically, it's just that we don't yet have the quantum computers to make that practical
[13:19:32] <maroon> it would require either creating a new way to factor numbers, or quantum computers, or someone getting really really lucky
[13:19:55] <Peng> RSA-896 in particular? Should be possible soon, if it isn't already. But people with supercomputers usually have better things to do.
[13:20:03] <piou> but nothings seems to oppose having better quantum computers in the future so there's no doubt in my mind that there will be a time where RSA is judged as trivial as DES
[13:20:05] <maroon> it will take more than $200k worth of electricity to crack the 2048
[13:20:42] <maroon> except DES is defined as 56 bits, while RSA could just take bigger primes
[13:20:47] <piou> true
[13:21:07] <pulseaudio> maybe quantum can bring down the cost and time.
[13:21:15] <Sofia> pulseaudio: If you want it cracked, just create a cryptocurrency with finding plausible primes. If anyone finds it, they get a big $$$$ reward. Otherwise when the hash of the key ends in so many zeros, they get a small $$ reward.
[13:21:16] <maroon> i dont know if there's a way to detect whether 'n' is the product of 2 primes or 10 primes
[13:21:21] <Sofia> (Please don't do that.)
[13:21:40] <maroon> ... other than factoring n
[13:23:03] <pulseaudio> how does quantum come to help ?

[13:23:28] <piou> quantum algorithms are just hugely more efficient to tackle such factorization
[13:23:36] <maroon> it's the magic pixie dust that will let all sorts of things be solved
[13:23:51] <Sofia> Fortunately not all things.
[13:24:29] <pulseaudio> how long before RSA is trivial ? Cause they will need a new crypto system.
[13:25:03] <Peng> Impossible to say
[13:25:04] <maroon> rsa-256 is trivial, rsa-2048 is not
[13:25:31] <piou> pulseaudio: who's "they"? We already have new crypto systems, people already start recommending not to use RSA when other algorithms are available
[13:25:43] <maroon> i can factor rsa256 in my computer in a few minutes, but i have no chance against 2048
[13:26:31] <piou> I guess we can scale up RSA forever so that even quantum computers have issues, so there's always a way to make RSA "secure", it's just that by that time we're sure to have more efficient alternatives to RSA
[13:27:44] <pulseaudio> what are the alternatives to RSA ? I was also reading about krackjack something algorithms
[13:28:21] <maroon> generally, some of the elliptic curve stuff
[13:28:34] <Peng> piou: Have you seen DBJ's post-quantum RSA paper? It's like a billion or trillion bits.

[13:29:54] <maroon> though i find it ironic that they poop on DH by complaining about how everyone piled into using the same few safe prime modulus. so their solution? have everyone switch to elliptic curve, where everyone piles into the same 1 prime modulus
[13:30:29] <pulseaudio> is knapsack safer than RSA ?
[13:30:52] <piou> pulseaudio: for signatures you have things like ecdsa or ed25519 etc... there are lots of elliptic curve algorithms that cover all RSA use
[13:31:56] <pulseaudio> any ideas on knapsack's security ?
[13:32:21] <piou> I'm not familiar with knapsack, is that a class of algs that use the knapsack problem as the hard problem? I don't know of any real system that uses that so I'd stay far away from it at the moment.
[13:32:47] <Peng> SJB*
[13:32:51] <Peng> DJB*
[13:33:51] <piou> pulseaudio: "This cipher aroused a great deal of interest at the beginning because it was based on a probably hard problem, but in 1982 Adi Shamir provided a fast algorithm for solving knapsack problems."
[13:34:31] <piou> seems that the only references I can find are of cryptanalysis exercises, so I would stay far away from knapsack
[13:35:47] <pulseaudio> I found it in David Burton's Elementary Number Theory Book.
[13:36:08] <yawkat> super difficult to build np-hard public key crypto. uov and friends try to, but they have necessary simplifications that may lead to breaks.
[13:37:06] <piou> pulseaudio: yeah, that's an interesting curiosity but since there's a published attack that seems good against the problem itself that's a math curiosity at the moment, not a serious candidate for security

[21:18:19] <brick> Hello, I'm currently having trouble verifying how ring signatures work. I'm currently reading "Traceable Ring Signature" by Fujisaki and Suzuki. But I'm stuck on the signing protocol (page 10) on the step 4 which picks random z_j, c_j \in Z_q on step 4.b but later discards z_j when generating z_i?
[21:18:34] <brick> And also how is power to a fraction  works on multiplicative group elements? (Page 10, step 1 on Signing protocol)

[22:50:55] <cvmn> if CSPRNG exists, then it means that P != NP, right?  but, what about a true random number generators existing?  will the latter also mean that P != NP?  or is it that the latter is unrelated to P != NP?

[23:02:09] <Alipha> TRNGs typically feed into a CSPRNG because of the slow rate of randomness TRNGs can generate
