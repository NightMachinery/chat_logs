[01:06:14] <Dreamer409> An older kid showed me how to hack the game we were playing, and I was hooked. I saved up and got a TI-99/4a for $30 at a garage sale, and eventually my brother gave me his Amiga. Someone else gave me a dialin to the university library, which allowed you to interrupt to a shell...and the hacking was on.

[06:07:44] <pnbeast> lockywolf, it's usually better to ask your real question.  "attributes" is the only answer I know to your question, but maybe someone else knows a better one.
[06:09:57] <lockywolf> I can tell about the use-case. I have a large disc mounted at /mnt/big. I usually mount it on boot, and save my torrent downloads there. Sometimes USB3 sucks, and the disc is not mounted.

[06:13:43] <pnbeast> lockywolf, yes, that's a sensible question.  (usually it comes up with NFS mounts, though, not USB problems)  Again, someone else probably has a better answer, but I'd use cron (whatever variant you have) to run a script at boot time to carefully check for the mount and, somehow, break something visible or warn you clearly that there's a failure.

[06:15:12] <rustytaco> lockywolf: you could use a file in the underlying directory such as .UNMOUNTED that you check for
[06:15:31] <lockywolf> Such a cron job is planned, but I am seeing it as more of a hack than properly protecting the mount point
[06:15:37] <rustytaco> lockywolf: once you mount over the  directory, that file wont be visible
[06:15:38] <kfrench> Just mount a tmpfs on the mount point as read-only

[06:18:04] <rustytaco> sure they could, if they cared if its a mountpoint, but that's not a normally desired behaviour -- sometimes for example when a fs gets too small, one might create another elsewhere and mount it on the folder after copying the contents to it

[06:53:51] <pnbeast> wdkrnls, maybe you can define who can mount things in your fstab file.

[06:54:20] <pnbeast> Oh, to use it?  Sorry, never mind me.

[11:18:08] <SpearRaven> it's known to have a few issues
[11:18:29] <Sauvin> doofenshmirtz, we try not to second-guess rolling-release distros partly because they like to roll their users over.
[11:18:45] <tusko> wat
[11:19:06] <tusko> If you're not using rolling-release and we're in 2022, you're doing it wrong
[11:19:17] <tusko> NixOS should be top of everybodies radar
[11:19:40] <Sauvin> Some of us value stability over bleeding edge.
[11:19:42] <tusko> before two weeeks it might be *the* predominant OS on the webs
[11:19:50] <mlu> rolling release is fine if you're willing to troubleshoot everytime you do an update (or every few weeks or so)
[11:20:06] <tusko> nah, hyperbole!
[11:20:11] <Sauvin> No. It's not.
[11:20:16] <tusko> disagree

[11:20:58] <tusko> I can never get Debian's wifi to work out of the box to even install it.
[11:21:01] <mlu> nah, my rates are just that of an experienced software developer
[11:21:03] <mlu> my doctors have higher rates
[11:21:10] <doofenshmirtz> mlu, will compiling the kernel help? I am using 5.15
[11:21:16] <SpearRaven> yeah, my wifi worked straight away
[11:21:23] <mlu> doofenshmirtz: hard to say: gut feeling says no
[11:21:26] <SpearRaven> never had to do anything to it
[11:21:42] <doofenshmirtz> so, I can do nothing but wait?
[11:21:42] <tusko> I've tried on several laptops, desktops, I always have driver issues with Debian.
[11:21:47] <tusko> so I just use slackware now.
[11:21:48] <mlu> doofenshmirtz: it seems like more of a PulseAudio <-> ALSA issue based on my skimming on the bug thread than a pure driver issue
[11:22:21] <SpearRaven> oh ok, not a single issue here with Debian on my desktop or laptop
[11:22:30] <doofenshmirtz> I think my distro uses pulseaudio.
[11:22:33] <SpearRaven> works great straight off the bat
[11:22:34] <tusko> using slack is a bit like falling in love with the girl of your dreams and then having multiple children with her and she ages good, too, like fine wine
[11:22:40] <doofenshmirtz> *doesn't use pulseaudio

[11:22:55] <mlu> the Threadripper motherboards are peculiar though since there's no standardized onboard sound
[11:23:04] <mlu> so you went back to discrete audio chips and each mobo uses different ones
[11:23:33] <SpearRaven> my hardware is not new though, and mostly ASUS

[11:23:51] <tusko> omg when software developers call themselves engineers.... like nails on a chalkboard to a playa
[11:24:05] <mlu> but ASUS had to choose an audio chip on their own for their TRX40 mobos
[11:24:17] <mlu> and when that happens, that's a new setup and you're bound to get issues

[11:25:09] <mlu> this reminds me of my first Linux experience in which RedHat 8.0 didn't support my AC'97 sound card
[11:25:21] <doofenshmirtz> oh. so, it was ASUS that made it hard for their Linux users.
[11:25:28] <mlu> I'd actaully blame AMD
[11:25:41] <tusko> if i had a child, and my child became a software developer but then went around calling themselves an engineer... I would get an abortion, right away.
[11:25:58] <tusko> its my right
[11:26:10] <mlu> AMD left on-board audio out of the TRX40 chipset, so each mobo developer had to choose their own if they wanted onboard sound on the mobos
[11:26:13] <doofenshmirtz> tusko, you cannot have abortion once it's already out of your womb.
[11:26:35] <mlu> tusko: how would you define engineer?
[11:27:01] <Sauvin> Think I'd like an answer to mlu's question, as well.
[11:27:22] <tusko> I suppose one who went through an accredited engineering program approved by some recognized national body of engineers, and preferably who also had passed exams pursuant to licensure as an engineer
[11:27:23] <pikapika> So nice
[11:27:27] <pikapika> PaulFertser,
[11:27:28] <doofenshmirtz> engineers are people who work on engines
[11:27:35] <Sauvin> tusko, what is an engineer?
[11:27:44] <pikapika> I don't know if its just the newer kernel version or also some things in the new xubuntu
[11:27:45] <pikapika> but
[11:27:53] <pikapika> the release notes state tigerlake is supported
[11:28:10] <pikapika> and so the wifi and sound are working out-of-the-box from a live usb I used for testing
[11:28:19] <pikapika> I think I will dist upgrade my base os
[11:28:39] <tusko> in the US that would be someone with a college degree from an ABET accredited program, who has passed the fundamentals of engineering exam, and preferably also a licensed professional engineer.
[11:28:55] <mlu> tusko: sounds like I'd qualify since I got an ABET-accredited degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from a certain well-known college

[15:43:43] <pikapika> PaulFertser, whats wrong with C?
[15:44:03] <kurahaupo> PaulFertser: passing the address of a char when an int* is expected could cause stack smashing, if you're unlucky with where that char is placed
[15:44:20] <pikapika> yeah have you changed the printf statement
[15:44:45] <hay207> Yes
[15:44:55] <PaulFertser> pikapika: its weak typesystem and lack of facilities needed to build higher-level abstractions make it a rather dangerous tool even if the hands of an experienced developer. Since computers now are much, much faster than they were 30 years ago it makes sense to use a stricter language these days.

[15:52:16] <jim> it's actually not very high, asm is only one or two levels lower
[15:52:20] <kurahaupo> pikapika: Sure, but that's the same as any regular high level "3rd Generation" language. That's not VERY high level, there are languages well above C
[15:52:41] <pikapika> kurahaupo, but that does not make C a low level language or an "advanced assembler"
[15:52:58] <kurahaupo> That wasn't the delusion I was referring to
[15:53:01] <PaulFertser> And lots of implicing type conversions make C closer to assembler than the other similar languages of the era such as Pascal.
[15:53:10] <pikapika> also C provides you the facilities to easily build whatever style of programming you prefer

[15:56:17] <pikapika> kurahaupo, very high might have been exagerrated but its certainly not low level
[15:56:45] <PaulFertser> pikapika: "very" and "high" is all subjective. We can compare individual features of specific languages. You'd see C has much less of them compared to modern languages. Wether you can still consider C to be "high" enough or not is just a terminology argument.
[15:56:51] <pikapika> I just think that saying C is outdated in 2021 is overstated
[15:57:09] <kurahaupo> Obviously it's not as low level as assembly, nor is it as high as SQL or Haskell

[16:17:08] <nebuchadnezzer_1> ok

[16:20:21] <PaulFertser> hodapp: I can't agree that C++ templates is a low level abstraction; if they were macros (like CPP or M4), yes, I'd agree. But they're actually Turing-complete and allow computation.
[16:20:31] <pikapika> Of course. Persons who have created a language provide all manners of justifications for it. We have to wait and observe the fruits it bears before saying anything.

[16:23:46] <PaulFertser> hodapp: afaik concepts are basically a way to specify constraints for the template arguments so instead of getting 10 pages of error messages you get just few lines thanks to earlier checking of what's allowed to instantiate.
[16:23:47] <pikapika> hodapp, come back to me when the haskell people or the rust people or whatever manage to build an ecosystem that is competent with the present one in features and is actually usable on things not super computers

[16:34:53] <pikapika> hodapp, I only talked about Java an an example for comparison. I didn't use Haskell as a comparison, but I did mention it in the sense of it being trendy among language enthusiasts as one of the "languages that will solve it all"

[16:35:20] <NyB> FWIW, C is one of the few languages where you can somewhat convicingly say that there is a reasonably-sized book that covers a lot of it. So I would not say it's unfriendly to beginners.

[17:16:45] <hexnewbie> NyB: I think... It has to be my fault. I'm doing btrfs raid1 over LUKS and LVM (instead of partitioning the LUKS), which makes this rather unique configuration that may trip odd bugs in right about anything. Which is why going to bullseye seems like the only reasonable thing to do, since I have no idea where to start (so why not change everything)
[17:17:02] <rascul> anyone interested in fortran isn't a real person
[17:17:10] <PaulFertser> pikapika: very well. I once had to fix a fortar IV (!) program to be usable on a modern system. It wasn't fun at all. But probably you'd enjoy it.

[17:36:12] <pikapika> For example if I mute the laptop speaker and plug in the usb, it immediately detects it and switches to the volume saved for it
[17:36:18] <PaulFertser> rascul: do you have an example of a system where headphones jack insertion events are reported by ACPI and then handled somehow in software to change alsa mixer settings or sommething like that?
[17:36:21] <pikapika> and of course music is playing correctly
[17:36:37] <rascul> PaulFertser you can get the acpi event yourself, what you do with it is up to you
[17:36:48] <rascul> acpid allows you to do things with events
[17:36:49] <PaulFertser> pikapika: USB sound card is another sound card, so pulseaudio remembers per-card settings, that's not surprising.

[23:52:08] <Thorne> Hi I use EndeavourOS. The speaker doesn't get muted when I connect an earphone, I had to Enable the setting in alsamixer.  But it doesn't stay if I reboot. I did alsactl store, It seemed to work once, But I still have to enable it in alsamixer again.
[23:52:20] <Thorne> How do I permanently store this setting.
