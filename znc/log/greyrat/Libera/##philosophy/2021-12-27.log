[00:37:24] <causative_> the difficulty with altruism is that if it reduces the altruist's reproductive fitness, we would evolve to have fewer altruists over time
[00:37:42] <causative_> the solution is to set up social systems so that altruism *increases* the altruist's reproductive fitness
[00:38:15] <causative_> setting up social systems that reward those who cause good for all, and punish those who cause harm for all. This is the concept of justice.
[00:39:18] <causative_> and it depends very strongly on determining which actions cause good and which actions cause harm; for this we need more social systems that are designed to effectively distinguish truth from lies
[00:41:45] <causative_> truth must be the foundation of a good society, and effective truth-seeking social systems are the foundation of truth
[00:42:57] <causative_> so what qualities should an effective truth-seeking social system have?
[00:44:10] <causative_> and what qualities tend to corrupt and degrade the functioning of truth-seeking systems?
[00:46:06] <amigojapan> We should not "punish"anyone
[00:47:34] <causative_> suppose someone becomes rich and powerful by hurting other people, and has many children who share his tendencies and who he provides with instruction in his approach. So they repeat. This is bad. We need to punish him enough so that hurting others is not profitable for him.
[00:48:17] <amigojapan> No publishing is bad
[00:48:31] <amigojapan> Punishing*
[00:48:53] <causative_> Then what do you do with this person?
[00:48:53] <amigojapan> No one should be punished
[00:49:12] <causative_> you let him continue?
[00:49:36] <amigojapan> causative_: if someone is like a murderer, you put them away, but not in punishment
[00:49:46] <causative_> prison is a form of punishment
[00:49:52] <amigojapan> No
[00:50:21] <amigojapan> causative_: you could let them drink beer and play videogames in prison
[00:50:38] <causative_> https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/punishment b : a penalty inflicted on an offender through judicial procedure
[00:50:38] <ro-bot-o> [url] Punishment Definition & Meaning - Merriam-Webster | www.merriam-webster.com
[00:51:19] <amigojapan> But prison does not need to be a penalty
[00:51:36] <causative_> does he want to get out and is not able to?  then it's a penalty

[00:52:27] <amigojapan> Anyway the intention is what matters, we should never intended to "punish"someone
[00:53:01] <amigojapan> Current system does intend that and thus is overly cruel
[00:53:17] <causative_> well, however you feel about it, what matters is that we disincentivize behavior that harms society
[00:53:39] <causative_> you can do it with glee and schadenfreude, or you can do it with sad neutrality; either way it must be done and either way the effect is the same
[00:54:52] <amigojapan> causative_: disincentivizing does not always work. Even in Japan here where we have hanging as death penalty, murder still goes on
[00:55:28] <amigojapan> Some people just don't care
[00:55:36] <causative_> great, and you have a system in mind that you think would work in which murderers suffer no negative consequences?

[00:56:01] <amigojapan> Yeah, but they are out away from society
[00:56:33] <amigojapan> But not punished
[00:57:02] <amigojapan> For life
[00:58:51] <amigojapan> The idea that one human being should punish another needs to be eliminated
[00:59:45] <amigojapan> That is an old way of thinking
[01:00:25] <amigojapan> And obviously can be abused

[04:43:24] <biys> causative_: could you just reward just behaviour above and beyond bad behaviour?
[04:44:17] <biys> make the reward for good behaviour out-weigh the bad behaviour's results?
[04:47:43] <biys> firstly i can't see how you'd manage to manipulate all people to work in such a manner as to promote the best possible outcome for all people
[04:47:51] <biys> but i'm willing to move past that point
[04:48:16] <biys> sounds like a significant paradigm shift would be required surrounding the idea of individual worth
[04:49:34] <causative_> I don't know what you mean by "make the reward for good behavior out-weigh the bad behavior's results"
[04:49:44] <thunder> reciprocity takes care of most such issues
[04:51:10] <thunder> people who behave badly will not be welcomed by those who behave better. that said, what is better/worse will be cultural in nature. past the point of the individual's fit within a society, there is the reciprocity between societies themselves, such as international politics/economics
[04:52:00] <biys> well if the bad behaviour is to net some kind of reward, the contrary position should reward 2x
[04:52:05] <biys> kind of like at the casino
[04:52:14] <causative_> reciprocity can also be very bad; corruption is rooted in reciprocity. The corp does something nice for the politician, the politician does something nice in return
[04:52:59] <causative_> bribery is reciprocity
[04:53:09] <thunder> yep. and eventually people get tired of that and take responsibility by making more ethical consumer decisions. until then though, you can't just blame people in power. you have to stop giving it to them in the first place.
[04:53:20] <causative_> collusion is reciprocity
[04:53:28] <thunder> so is cooperation
[04:53:31] <causative_> "good-old-boys" clubs are reciprocity
[04:53:41] <thunder> reciprocity isn't a moral statement. it's more like thermodynamics
[04:54:02] <thunder> it's what in the aggregate, maintains the balance
[04:54:51] <causative_> biys, yes it is necessary to apply rewards/punishments such that people are lured to good behavior
[04:55:24] <biys> but i don't wanna be punished
[04:55:25] <causative_> they have to be strong enough to actually make that happen - so they must eliminate the gains from villainy, and compensate for the costs of altruism
[04:55:29] <biys> so lets just avoid punishing
[04:55:48] <biys> idk how you'd eliminate the gains from villainy
[04:55:50] <biys> as you say it
[04:56:02] <biys> what happens behind closed doors
[04:56:09] <biys> unless we're going to 1984 it
[04:56:15] <biys> put a speaker in everyones living room or whatever
[04:56:16] <thunder> where do all these magnanimous rewards come from? are you planning to work overtime to produce them, or just go with the usual extortion to get it from everyone else?
[04:56:53] <causative_> well, if a business steals $12,000 from its employees through unpaid overtime and other illegal practices, they need to be fined an amount so that fine * (chance of getting caught) > $12000
[04:57:19] <causative_> that's how to "eliminate the gains from villainy"
[04:57:41] <thunder> it used to be that common law courts would sort out this sort of thing, but now you have government regulatory capture, so corporations get a free ride and impunity from consequences
[04:58:12] <causative_> make the punishment sufficient to actually disincentivize the behavior
[04:58:13] <maplefinger> that happens a lot in the USA
[04:58:14] <thunder> or a slap on the risk for the media and a packet of cash in the back room
[04:58:34] <causative_> wage theft happens a lot in the USA, punishments for wage theft are few and far between
[04:58:41] <causative_> and insufficient

[05:00:34] <causative_> thunder, naturally the rewards come from taxation

[05:02:08] <ro-bot-o> [wiktionary] extortion — noun: 1. The practice of extorting money or other property by the use of force or threats

[05:04:54] <causative_> I wouldn't call it "extortion" - that's a dysphemism, and it doesn't apply. Taxation is coercion though
[05:05:02] <causative_> all laws are coercion
[05:05:03] <maplefinger> s/fired/fire
[05:05:03] <ro-bot-o> maplefinger meant to say: oh god, yet another ministry to the suburbanites who think shit like roads, fire departments, and armies just grow on trees
[05:05:25] <causative_> if the police say "you can't go around burning people's houses down or we'll lock you up," that's coercion
[05:05:26] <causative_> by the police
[05:05:30] <causative_> and it's a good thing
[05:05:40] <causative_> same with taxation
[05:05:43] <thunder> self-defence is notwithstanding
[05:05:46] <maplefinger> technically that's a form of prevention by threat
[05:05:58] <causative_> it's using the threat of violent force to change your behavior - for the better
[05:06:19] <maplefinger> *incarcertaion
[05:06:33] <maplefinger> hm whats up with this kew keyboard?  "incarceration"
[05:07:36] <thunder> the basis of our society is built on a rotton foundation, extortion. no amount of lipstick on the pig will change that.
[05:08:07] <causative_> you haven't made much of an argument for why the use of violent force to make people pay taxes is *bad*
[05:08:17] <causative_> you'e slapped a nasty word on it without justifying your position
[05:08:27] <maplefinger> nobody uses "violent force" to make people pay taxes
[05:08:44] <causative_> it's easy to justify the contrary:  taxes are necessary to make people help each other instead of just themselves
[05:08:46] <thunder> if I have to explain it, I'd be wasting my breath tbh
[05:08:51] <causative_> to provide social programs and law wnforcement
[05:09:27] <maplefinger> causative_ he seems like a reactionary
[05:09:33] <thunder> if people want that stuff, they'll pay for it voluntarily. philanthropy isn't created by governments, but by the goodwill of individuals.
[05:09:44] <maplefinger> no interest in "what is right and good," just "fuck everyting" mindset.  Very immature
[05:10:06] <thunder> you're projecting
[05:10:31] <causative_> thunder, is it okay for people to pay for law enforcement "voluntarily"?  This would be using their private money to pay for a bunch of people to pick up guns and call themselves police and coerce others into doing what they want
[05:10:40] <causative_> that seems very wrong to me
[05:10:56] <causative_> rule by the rich - rule by those who can afford to buy private police forces
[05:11:04] <causative_> we might call them warlords
[05:11:22] <maplefinger> nah just buy all the guns yourself and rule with an iron fist
[05:11:28] <maplefinger> that's called "good society"
[05:11:50] <maplefinger> just keep attacking the other warlords and killing them, taking their weapons
[05:11:52] <thunder> most of this comes down to a question of property law and it's enforcement. other than personal self-defence, that's the primary issue at stake. not a one-size-fits all answer, because property definitions vary as do a given culture's ideas about proper means of enforcement
[05:12:02] <maplefinger> if they were feeding people, you have to kill those people
[05:12:11] <maplefinger> because they will become rebels and you can't have that
[05:12:24] <maplefinger> next, you'll want to appoint a few vice warlords
[05:12:34] <maplefinger> but make sure they have big structural problems first
[05:12:42] <maplefinger> otherwise they'll just kill you and take over
[05:12:49] <maplefinger> or as thunder calls it, "utopia"
[05:12:55] <causative_> ultimately, some people will do things that are wrong, and the only way to stop them is to use force against them
[05:13:00] <causative_> not all of society can be voluntary
[05:13:04] <thunder> do I know you maplefinger?
[05:13:10] <thunder> have we conversed before?
[05:13:14] <causative_> violent force is always going to be needed to maintain any society

[05:13:50] <thunder> I don't believe we have. if we had you'd know better than to project your ignorant characterizations at me.

[06:13:35] <Bakunin> because most of your statements are in the flavor "this is a good rule for a reason, but here is an exception..."

[06:13:52] <Bakunin> then the wander begins
[06:14:02] <Bakunin> talking to causative_ here
[06:14:20] <shea> I agree Bakunin. Whenever causative_ comes in here with his lofty ideas, there's always something so bothersome about it
[06:14:39] <Bakunin> it's just like wandering aimlessly but finding interesting nodes in the landscape
[06:14:49] <shea> A pure dilettante
[06:14:52] <Bakunin> sort of like jamming with no riffs, static ideas, or changes
[06:15:24] <Bakunin> causative_ I'm not telling you to be quiet, I'm suggesting you collect these thoughts, make them more cohesive, and present them
[06:17:11] <shea> Funnily enough, he was the one to propose this idea of 'resentful distrust', by which people are to dismiss others' ideas unless they have sufficiently rebutted the presumption that such ideas are useless and not worth considering.
[06:17:42] <shea> Dismiss their ideas as meaningless that is

[06:27:02] <Bakunin> thats the problem with thinking out loud as the thesis.  eventually you contradict yourself
[06:27:11] <Bakunin> how u doin shea
[06:27:15] <Bakunin> havin a good one?
[06:28:36] <shea> Well, it's definitely a whole lot easier to be considered wise by the oracle of Delphi

[06:34:13] <causative_> shea, you misunderstood what I said about resentful distrust
[06:34:36] <causative_> I advocated a resentful distrust towards the question of whether what is said is *meaningful at all*, not a resentful distrust towards whether it is *true*
[06:34:42] *** Quits: llh (~llh@user/llh) (Quit: :::: ( UPP ) ::::)
[06:35:40] <causative_> in fact I advocate we take joy in novel ideas, that we reserve judgment over whether something is *true* so that we may consider it, and that we avoid the problem of being too certain in our own beliefs
[06:36:57] <causative_> it's good to have ideas up in the air, but true or false they should all mean something; there should be some difference in the world were they true versus were they false

[06:38:56] <shea> I really don't want to revisit your little device. I think it's akin to cracking a nut with a sledgehammer. A blanket presumption that hinders discussion, and yet fails to filter out the things that it purports to filter - case in point, your "wandering" thoughts about various things which always seem to devolve into an argument over semantics.
[06:39:00] <causative_> in most areas of study, the question of whether something is "meaningful" never comes up
[06:39:40] <causative_> it's only in certain abstruse areas of philosophy, or certain social sciences, or politics, that people are apt to make statements that don't clearly mean anything one way or the other
[06:40:37] <causative_> if you find that talking with me "devolves into semantics," it's only because you grossly misinterpret the semantic content of what I've said!
[06:40:56] <shea> It's not me that you usually have semantic arguments with
[06:41:13] <causative_> e.g. by thinking the "resentful distrust" is about any idea at all, rather than just about ideas that don't at first glance seem even meaningful
[06:43:27] <causative_> in matters of semantics in the English language - i.e. reading comprehension - I test in the top percentile.
[06:43:41] <shea> Oh right, so it's a device by which people are to be distrustful as to whether something is meaningful where something doesn't seem meaningful? Isn't this just a totally redundant device?
[06:45:41] <causative_> I've explained that as clearly as I could shea
[06:46:04] <causative_> it's when the question is whether the idea is even meaningful, *not* when the question is whether the idea is true
[06:46:21] <shea> Yes, well by my understanding it's just pure and simple sophistry. You give yourself far too much credit, my friend.
[06:56:56] <causative_> you're heard the phrase "not even wrong" - that's what the "resentful distrust" is about
[06:57:04] <causative_> ideas that are "not even wrong"
[06:59:44] <causative_> it's incorrect to apply it as a standard to dismiss all new ideas
[06:59:55] <audrey> Howdy Bakunin and shea
[06:59:56] <shea> Yes, but when the phrase is used it is used to refer to ideas that are unfalsifiable, If this is your meaning by 'resentful distrust', then you have said something trite but dressed it up in lofty language
[06:59:59] <audrey> welcome to the madhouse :)
[07:00:08] <Bakunin> o/
[07:00:32] <shea> audrey: Hello. As you can see I'm making myself at home.
[07:00:40] <audrey> Perfect
[07:01:25] <causative_> shea, so you are just now discovering what I have meant, and you call it "trite" instead of apologizing for completely misinterpreting me this whole time?
[07:03:00] <audrey> Enjoy the hot air. We´re currently working on a way to monetize it by harnessing it as a source of energy.
[07:03:18] <audrey> This could be the alternative to coal that the United States has been looking for.
[07:03:32] <audrey> Patents are pending.
[07:03:39] <shea> Well, I disagree that in our previous conversation you defined your device in the manner that you are doing now - I still retain the logs. But in any case, if that was your meaning previously, you utterly failed to communicate it. Furthermore, there becomes a question of purpose where someone seeks to convey an already established idea by giving it a new name and attempting to pass if off as
[07:03:41] <shea> their own, original, idea.
[07:04:27] <causative_> man I communicated it a dozen times, today and that other day
[07:04:53] <shea> In our previous conversation, there is zero times where the concept of falsifiability comes up, either explicitly or otherwise.
[07:05:14] <shea> Your device was made in reference to 'meaningfulness' which is something different entirely
[07:05:59] <shea> In fact, you claimed that we could empirically prove the existence of the soul, which is the quintessential example of something that is unfalsifiable
[07:06:52] <shea> You sought to argue that we could prove Plato's notion of the soul as expoused in Phaedo. You argued that that gave his ideas meaning. His ideas are totally unfalsifiable
[07:07:01] <causative_> now, hold on, I claimed that *if* the soul was real and life after death could be experienced, then that experience would empirically support the notion of the soul
[07:07:01] <shea> As to the soul that is.
[07:07:05] <causative_> I didn't say that the soul was real
[07:07:06] <causative_> it's not
[07:07:18] <causative_> we can't empirically prove the existence of the soul because it doesn't exist
[07:07:26] <causative_> but *if* it did, we could
[07:07:52] <shea> Okay. Let me get my meaning across by asking a few quick questions.
[07:08:25] <shea> Are we to be resentfully distrusting of Plato's ideas of the soul as expoused in Phaedo?
[07:08:49] <causative_> not for the reason of meaninglessness
[07:08:58] <shea> Yes or no?
[07:09:05] <causative_> they aren't meaningless, they're just false
[07:09:17] <shea> Are we to be resentfully distrusting of Plato's ideas of the soul as expoused in Phaedo?
[07:09:42] <causative_> I wouldn't say we should apply the same attitude of "resentful distrust" because that's a phrase I am using to talk about *meaninglessness*, not falsehood
[07:09:53] <Bakunin> object permanence? i’ll believe it when i see it
[07:09:59] <causative_> we should disbelieve Plato's ideas about the soul, but not "resentfully distrust" them
[07:10:10] <causative_> they're only wrong, not worthy of such ire
[07:10:16] <shea> Are Plato's ideas of the soul falsifiable in the ordinary sense of the term?
[07:10:34] <Bakunin> causative_ is gpt-4a.92
[07:11:01] <Bakunin> gewgel enjineerz sed so
[07:11:06] <causative_> yes shea , if souls were real there would be observable consequences, and the lack of such observations would falsify them
[07:11:54] <Bakunin> honky muf be messn mah'ole laydeh? GOT! to be runnin   c o l d  up-side-down his head, you know?
[07:11:55] <shea> Isn't it true that the soul is unfalsifiable in the same way that the existence of God is unfalsifiable?
[07:12:16] <Bakunin> no
[07:12:19] <causative_> the existence of God depends on what you mean by "God," and certain concepts of God are certainly falsifiable
[07:12:19] <Bakunin> thats false
[07:12:36] <causative_> for example, suppose you believe in a God that you say will strike with lightning anyone who eats a banana the wrong way
[07:12:41] <Bakunin> soul is testable, and it always fails, because surprise, humans invented it
[07:12:55] <causative_> then, if someone eats a banana the "wrong way" and is not struck down, then your concept of God has been falsified
[07:13:34] <causative_> I don't say that falsification is the whole story of meaning - it's a very *important* piece, but my concept of meaning is more than that
[07:19:35] <causative_> doomsday cults also have very falsifiable ideas of God, which are in fact falsified when the date of doomsday passes without incident. This usually doesn't stop them though.
[07:19:35] <Delf> You hurt my feelings when you make such statements. The soul doesn't exist!? That would mean that unicorns also doesn't exist
[07:19:53] <shea> Okay then, moving away from the point about the soul because it really is a distraction from the main discussion, you've admitted that your idea of resentful distrust is more than what is meant when people say "not even wrong", notwithstanding the fact that you said not 15 minutes ago that I had discovered your meaning when I touched on falsifiability being the core concept of "not even wrong"
[07:19:55] <shea> and as such I should have apologised instead of calling the device "trite"! Once again, you pivot and adjust your ideas, deceitfully setting traps for me and others to fall into. And when these things are revisited, you say "oh but I didn't really say that, you misunderstand my meaning". Well, at this point I either have to conclude that all this is in bad faith, or that you are hopeless at
[07:19:57] <shea> maintaining a cohensive thought.
[07:21:18] <Delf> Relax...
[07:21:33] <shea> No
[07:21:53] <Delf> Why you no?
[07:22:38] <causative_> well, lack of falsifiability covers most of lack of meaning
[07:23:48] <Delf> You must accept that there are things you do not know
[07:23:54] <causative_> we might even say that all meaningful ideas are falsifiable and all falsifiable ideas are meaningful
[07:24:12] <causative_> the latter I would accept without doubt, the former I would accept with a little doubt
[07:24:47] <causative_> (when I say "without doubt" I'm exaggerating slightly, there's always doubt)
[07:24:57] *** Quits: bosspotato (~bosspotat@user/bosspotato) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[07:25:07] <Delf> What is there to accept?
[07:25:49] <causative_> but even so, falsifiability is not the *same* as meaning; the story of meaning is about signifiers and signified
[07:26:02] <causative_> something is meaningful if there is something it signifies
[07:26:12] <shea> You have strange notions of words that I cannot comprehend. Again, it seems inevitable that we will revisit the semantics of what you are saying because they do not make sense to me.
[07:26:26] <causative_> well, that's a "you" problem
[07:26:49] <Delf> What's a "you" problem?
[07:27:03] <shea> Well, it's hardly my problem if no one accepts your silly ideas
[07:27:22] <causative_> its your problem if you don't understand how I use language
[07:27:27] <causative_> because I use it in a standard way
[07:27:35] <shea> No you do not
[07:27:45] <Delf> Unlike me, I redefine words :P
[07:28:32] <shea> Just look at this sentence: "but even so, falsifiability is not the *same* as meaning; the story of meaning is about signifiers and signified". What utterly charming bollocks
[07:29:19] <shea> You write vaguely to mask the lack of precision in your ideas. Bakunin touched on this earlier.
[07:30:01] <Delf> ideas are a work in progress
[07:30:03] <causative_> what do you think is vague?
[07:30:29] <causative_> do you not know about signifiers and signified?
[07:30:44] <causative_> we can say map/territory, which has the same meaning
[07:30:52] <shea> No. What exactly is "the story of meaning"
[07:31:07] <causative_> the things we have to say, philosophically, about meaning
[07:31:11] <shea> What exactly do you mean by "signifiers and signified"
[07:31:39] <shea> "the things we have to say, philosophically, about meaning" This isn't vague?!
[07:32:03] <shea> You are an utter sophist. Please heed Bakunin's advice.
[07:32:32] <causative_> well, I'm not comprehensively telling you all the things we may say, philosophically, about meaning
[07:32:55] <causative_> but I think the phrase is perfectly clear; when we talk about meaning in philosophy, that is the "story of meaning"
[07:33:18] <causative_> for example, a philosophical treatise describing a theory of meaning would be part of the "story of meaning"
[07:34:40] <causative_> a signifier is something that is used to represent what is signified
[07:35:09] <shea> A recusive definition, the hallmark of a not vauge answer.
[07:35:13] <causative_> what is signified is an object, real or imaginary, that the discourse pertains to
[07:35:18] *** Quits: Bakunin (~maplefing@user/lindis) (Remote host closed the connection)
[07:36:12] <causative_> it's easier to give examples; "my cat" is a signifier for my cat
[07:36:44] <shea> You use all this language to obsure. Why not just call it an object? Or, if a greater degree of precision is needed, why not object of discussion? What exactly is the point of all this jargon?
[07:37:06] *** Joins: dude12312414 (~test@gateway/tor-sasl/dude12312414)
[07:37:22] <causative_> what's the point of restricting ourselves to just the words you find easy? and how would I know what words those are?
[07:41:19] <Delf> shea: I think he uses word that he consider to be best suitable to describe his meaning
[07:41:22] *** Joins: maplefinger (~maplefing@user/lindis)
[07:41:42] <shea> Because you deliberately use jargon to obsfuscate your meaning! You deliberately write not in plain english! And the kicker is that you use less efficient language, not more, which is usually the justification for using jargon in the first place. Instead of object you say "the signifier and signified" like ANYONE knows what on Earth you're on about. There is not, in my mind, any justifiable
[07:41:44] <shea> reason for a person looking to earnestly communicate their ideas in good faith to communicate in such a way! Every bit of the language you use when challenged on your ideas indicates an intention to confound rather than clarify.

[07:47:48] <audrey> Then again half of my degree was BS so maybe this is par for the course in the humanities.
[07:47:49] <shea> causative_ uses complicated language to express simple ideas in an attempt to give the impression that the idea has a greater significance than it really has -- as if the idea is not utterly trite. When challeneged on this, he begins his confounding game, pivoting almost imperceptibly, using loftier and loftier language until you forget what the broader point was, rather getting stuck on some
[07:47:51] <shea> minute point which usually relates to semantics, which, funnily enough is where we are ONCE AGAIN.
[07:48:04] <causative_> shea I am not intentionally trying to use complicated language
[07:48:05] <audrey> shea: yep, this sounds about right
[07:48:20] <causative_> I'm using standard terms in philosophy
[07:49:11] <Delf> This is why I don't do philosophy. It's too fancy for me
[07:49:47] <shea> causative_, ask yourself: why are we, again, talking about semantics?
[07:49:58] <causative_> because we were talking about meaning
[07:50:23] <maplefinger> most meaning comes from context
[07:50:41] <Delf> Not intention?
[07:50:54] <causative_> I was describing that the concept of meaning is more than just the concept of falsification, because meaning about semiotics, i.e. signifiers and signified, which goes beyond what we say when we just talk about falsification
[07:50:56] <maplefinger> no
[07:51:03] <causative_> or map/territory
[07:51:21] <causative_> I use map/territory more often than I use signifier/signified, and it means the same thing

[07:52:10] <shea> How are you utterly unable to express in simple terms how your device differs from "not even wrong"?
[07:52:23] <maplefinger> NEW is a good test
[07:52:34] <maplefinger> are you a xihr cultist
[07:52:35] <causative_> I didn't say it differed
[07:52:45] <maplefinger> :)
[07:52:48] <shea> THEN IT IS TRITE
[07:52:58] <causative_> very well, it is trite
[07:53:00] <causative_> also it's very important
[07:53:27] <causative_> "what is meaningful?"
[07:54:09] <causative_> the distinction I was making was in response to your question of why I wasn't talking about falsification from the start
[07:54:20] <maplefinger> There is no evidence that the extramundane idea is not intelligent, making it obvious that one can postulate the inexplicable embodiment, allowing us to control the cartesian oscillator until it becomes lorentzian.
[07:54:24] <shea> How have you managed to express something so very trite in the most densely incomprehensible language? This is the problem I am getting at. Had you merely said from the very beginning that we should be sceptical of things not able to be falsified, not me, not anyone, would have disagreed. We would not have wasted all of this time, and we could have moved on to other things
[07:54:37] <causative_> and the answer is that falsification and meaning are different concepts, even if the set of meaningless ideas may be the same as the set of non-falsifiable ideas
[07:54:52] <maplefinger> causative_ seems like he's blogpasting

[08:00:29] <causative_> can't be said of most of the people arguing with me
[08:01:15] <maplefinger> causative_ is just rollin coal
[08:02:15] <maplefinger> is morality subjective, causative_ ?
[08:03:05] <shea> That's funny. Several times you questioned my ability of comprehension. You've also said things today such as "man I communicated it a dozen times, today and that other day"; "well, that's a "you" problem [my being unable to understand you]"; "its your problem if you don't understand how I use language"; "because I use [language] in a standard way"; I could go on. I am seriously challenging
[08:03:08] <shea> your self awareness.
[08:03:13] <causative_> it's something each individual must figure out, but I do believe there is an objective truth about morality that reasonable people could agree on if we considered it long enough
[08:03:25] <causative_> shea, I am the last to get mad, but I do sometimes get mad

[08:05:18] <causative_> besides, it's true
[08:06:37] <Delf> It's a "you" problem, but not to worry because you're always happy to clarify and reword?
[08:06:50] <causative_> i.e. I only said "it's a you problem" in response to you spending a long time accusing me of it being a me problem
[08:07:15] <shea> Having an attitude which blames fellow interlocutors for their failure to comprehend when you use phrases and language which is, by your own admission, philosophical jargon (whether or not you would use that word, I merely use it in the standard, accepted way), I would submit is inconsistent with what you have said about yourself, your willingness to clarify and your belief that you approach
[08:07:18] <shea> discussions in good faith.
[08:07:19] <Delf> So you both reacted to each others reaction as the other being "the problem"
[08:07:33] <causative_> it's a philosophy channel, you ought to expect philosophy jargon
[08:08:21] <causative_> just as you ought to expect math jargon if you were in a math channel, or law jargon if you were in a law channel
[08:10:07] <Delf> Those are not mutually exclusive
[08:10:44] <Delf> I keep looking up words and "things" almost always and I get derailed like that but I'm assuming that it's not the intended purpose
[08:11:02] <shea> It's IRC. I would not blame someone for not having an awareness of, for example, legal jargon in a law channel. The reason being it is not unexpected or unreasonable for people who merely have an interest or pursue these things not professionally or formally to be in such channels and contribute to the discussion. I do not discount their input. Insofar as philosophy is considered, I have not
[08:11:04] <shea> studied it formally but I have an interest informally in discussing it. I submit that it is not unreasonable for me to be in here, for me to contribute and for me to expect someone to reasonably accomodate me to facilitate a good faith discussion.
[08:12:06] <shea> What you have just said is more revealing as to your intentions than you know.
[08:13:12] <Delf> State your intentions, shea
[08:13:13] <causative_> I also have not studied philosophy formally, but picking up new philosophy terms is as easy as reading the SEP article about them
[08:13:51] <causative_> well, it would be more accurate to say I haven't studied philosophy in an academic setting
[08:14:19] <shea> Is anything that I have just said unreasonable expectations for a member of this IRC channel or not? Do not avoid the broader point
[08:15:31] <causative_> sure, contribute as you want, as I said I'm happy to clarify anything you ask about
[08:15:56] <causative_> but if you see a philosophy term you don't recognize... you could also just look it up
[08:16:10] <shea> Delf: With regards to this particular conversation, my intentions is to make clear to causative_ that is method of expousing his ideas is inconsistent with notions of good faith discussion in an IRC channel, or, at least, is inconsistent with what he/she has said his/her approach is to such discussions in this channel
[08:16:48] <shea> causative_: I can't do that because I'm interested not in the terms themselves but what YOUR meaning is when using them.
[08:16:57] <causative_> then ask
[08:17:17] <Delf> Ok, shea. Thank you for answering
[08:17:50] <causative_> and don't get mad
[08:18:38] <Delf> causative_: That might suggest that there is not reason for them to get mad. Have you thought about it?
[08:18:44] *** Joins: llh (~llh@user/llh)
[08:19:22] <causative_> bringing emotion into a philosophy discussion is never helpful; elenchus depends on cooperation
[08:19:22] <Delf> You probably have, and hence saying it to communicate that your intention is not to make them mad
[08:19:39] <causative_> my intention is to convey my position clearly - if they get mad, or if they don't, is their business
[08:19:54] <shea> Perhaps it would be better if you spoke consistently with the reasonable expectations of the participants of this channel. That is, with awareness that many here are mere hobbyists and that, if you wish to get your point across in a manner consistent with having a good faith discussion, rather than merely trying to one-up someone by confounding them, you will forego the use of overly technical
[08:19:55] <causative_> I'm not going to insult them and make them mad, but I have no reservations about saying something they disagree with
[08:19:55] <Delf> Why would you say don't get mad then?
[08:19:57] <shea> jargon unless it is absolutely imperative. Signifiers and signified does not fall into that latter category, particularly in the concept of what you were trying to say.
[08:20:32] <causative_> Delf, because elenchus depends on cooperation, and it's very hard for two people to cooperate in sharing and exploring their ideas if one of them is yelling angrily at the other
[08:20:56] <causative_> the other one will likely soon join in too - it all breaks down
[08:21:10] <Delf> Unless one of them is me, then it's alright
[08:21:12] <causative_> the challenge is to disagree with someone and still neutrally, reasonably explore what they think and how they think it
[08:21:23] <causative_> elenchus is "how to disagree - in depth - without getting mad"
[08:22:00] <Delf> Without getting mad is probably a consequence of being tooo busy trying to understand
[08:22:41] <causative_> no, it's natural to feel angry if someone disagrees with you - but you have to clamp it down, set it aside, or you can't get about the business of discussing it reasonably
[08:22:42] <shea> Stop characterising what I have said as being 'mad'. What I have said was forcefully put, but its a far cry from it coming from a place of being 'mad'. Frustrated is more apt.
[08:22:46] <Delf> How do we move on forward from this situation?
[08:23:59] <Delf> causative_: Now you're pissing me off... Are you suggesting I'm not natural or that I'm dishonest when I don't get angry when someone disagree with me?

[08:47:16] <causative_> the concept of "you" in philosophy is tricky - we're all just piles of atoms, not irreducible existences in our own right. There's the Sorites paradox, and teleporter thought experiments
[08:47:30] <causative_> and brain uploading
[08:47:33] <Delf> This is interesting
[08:47:59] <causative_> some people try to achieve immortality through their works - sometimes we say a piece of us lives on in others. Is that right?
[08:48:04] <Delf> You is usually what you think is you, not what is actually you or more importantly, isn't you
[08:48:23] <causative_> and if we identify "you" with your consciousness, there's the problem of continuity of consciousness
[08:48:28] <causative_> or rather the lack of it
[08:48:47] <Delf> What part of me are you referring to?
[08:48:59] <Delf> I'm not just me, I'm you too
[08:49:00] <causative_> difficult to say
[08:49:11] <Delf> Yea, I know it sounds scary
[08:49:31] <causative_> in my opinion, the essence of identity is a certain abstract pattern - embodying a way of thinking and a set of desires for the universe
[08:49:46] <causative_> it's this pattern that matters, regardless of the form it takes, and true death is only when this pattern is gone
[08:50:09] <causative_> and if part of your pattern lives on in the minds of others - if others think the same way you do - then the essential you has not died
[08:50:19] <causative_> not completely
[08:50:25] <Delf> True death can also be not being present enough
[08:50:39] <amigojapan> Delf: I am thinking of a number right now, let me know what it is, if you are me
[08:51:09] <Delf> amigojapan: This will hardly prove anything. I don't even know what I'm thinking, what does that tell you?
[08:52:00] <causative_> amigojapan, is you from 12 months ago "you"? and can you tell me what number you from 12 months ago was thinking about around this time last year?
[08:52:09] <Delf> Identity is probably just an extension of our organizing capabilities
[08:53:09] <amigojapan> causative_: I probably forgot, but I am me, and no I am not my memories
[08:53:41] <causative_> I didn't ask if you were your memories, I asked if your identity remained the same over the last 12 months
[08:53:44] <dispersed> I am, not me
[08:53:53] <causative_> your person 12 months ago, not your memories
[08:54:35] <Delf> Listen here mate. I don't know me... and it makes me at unease, so I try to come with some half-assed answer but nevertheless manage to convince myself what I am
[08:54:41] <amigojapan> It does causative_
[08:54:47] <causative_> the point is that many people would say their identity did not change over 12 months, but they still don't know what they were thinking 12 months ago
[08:55:03] <causative_> so "X doesn't know what Y thinks" is not enough to conclude "X is not the same person as Y"
[08:55:57] <causative_> so just because Delf doesn't know what you're thinking is not enough to conclude he's not the same as you
[08:56:09] <maplefinger> is morality subjective, causative_ ?
[08:56:25] <causative_> <causative_> it's something each individual must figure out, but I do believe there is an objective truth about morality that reasonable people could agree on if we considered it long enough
[08:56:27] <Delf> I'm convinced that I'm you

[14:00:05] <arryana> breakfast port was an inspired idea, thank you, pussipupu
[14:00:59] <pussipupu> Port is a wonderful thing
[14:01:08] <arryana> agreed
[14:02:23] <arryana> the uk really does the christmas holiday well
[14:02:27] <pussipupu> I'm surprised to see so many celebrating Desmond Tutu's death this morning to be honest
[14:02:47] <pussipupu> did you start Christmas Day with bucks fizz?
[14:02:54] <arryana> who would -celebrate- that?
[14:03:01] <arryana> of course.
[14:03:28] <arryana> and ended it with quality street chocolate assortment
[14:03:32] <arryana> i thought it was a law here
[14:04:15] <arryana> i think there's a cadbury milk tray around here somewhere too
[14:04:44] <pussipupu> Apparently he's viewed as anti-Semitic by at least some
[14:04:54] <pussipupu> Though I've not seen anything to support that
[14:05:09] <arryana> i never heard that either
[14:05:20] <pussipupu> We've had no selection boxes yet this year, but I'll check if any are reduced after work
[14:05:32] <arryana> idiots will id, sadly
[14:06:04] <pussipupu> All I've found is him comparing the Israeli occupation Palestine with apartheid, which to be fair doesn't seem wrong or antisymmetric
[14:06:10] <pussipupu> pretend I can type
[14:06:28] <arryana> i read fluent typo, no worries
[14:06:41] <arryana> when all was 300 baud, -everyone- typed typo
[14:07:48] <sweetsymphony> can you explain that more to me pussipupu
[14:08:18] <sweetsymphony> isn't there muslims living in Israel as normal?
[14:09:26] <sweetsymphony> I know because of the war it's very separate but it is not like i imagined South Africa to have been, blacks here, whites there. I have never been to either country
[14:10:02] <sweetsymphony> so hard to understand what it is like
[14:11:32] <sweetsymphony> Muslims comprise 17.8% of the Israeli population. The majority of Muslims in Israel are Sunni Arabs, with an Ahmadiyya minority. The Bedouin in Israel are also Arab Muslims, with some Bedouin clans participating in the Israeli army.
[14:11:44] <sweetsymphony> sorry if this is a stupid question
[14:12:39] <arryana> for sure not a stupid question
[14:13:03] <Lumistmas> I might have a stupid question

[19:28:21] <causative_> here's an example of something that is meaningful but not falsifiable. Suppose that we have a magic button, and prior knowledge that when pressed the button will do one of two things. Either it will instantly kill us giving us no chance to even notice our death, or it will make a party balloon appear.
[19:29:26] <causative_> the proposition "The button will make a party balloon appear" is not falsifiable (by the person pressing the button); there is no observation we can make that falsifies it, because if it is false, we are dead before we can make any observation
[19:29:35] <causative_> but it is meaningful and can be verified by observation
[19:32:16] <causative_> the notion of quantum suicide is a similar concept, also not falsifiable, but it is verifiable

[19:32:50] <ro-bot-o> [url] Quantum suicide and immortality - Wikipedia | en.wikipedia.org
[19:33:10] <causative_> it's verifiable by going through events that ought to cause one's death, but miraculously always surviving
[19:33:18] <causative_> but it's not falsifiable, because if it's false you just die and observe nothing

[20:11:46] <assan> well
[20:11:50] <assan> time would tell
[20:12:12] <assan> usa used china and china became strong for it

[20:12:31] <biys> but that is part of it, sure
[20:12:47] <assan> if china uses africa then africa would become strong from it too probably, or maybe not
[20:12:54] <biys> not necessarily
[20:13:06] <biys> but that could be the case
[20:13:10] <assan> or necessarily
[20:13:15] <assan> yeah
[20:13:40] <assan> but anyways everything gets done at its own course according to the dao
[20:13:44] <biys> is "Zef" an African term?

[20:16:26] <biys> "we are experiencing science from white modernity"
[20:17:21] <assan> decolonizing
[20:18:57] <assan> let me check out the video
[20:19:20] <biys> it's kind of like..   neo-geocentrism
[20:19:20] <assan> everything would get done at due time
[20:20:15] <assan> lol
[20:20:56] <assan> well, science is definitely some effed up stuff
[20:21:04] <assan> like a mind control program
[20:21:25] <biys> UH OH
[20:21:32] <biys> naw, that's fair
[20:21:37] <biys> i tend to agree to some extent
[20:21:41] <biys> without further understanding
[20:21:46] <biys> but we could be thinking about two different things
[20:21:59] <assan> its just something for the elites of the civilization to keep their subjects in an experiment
[20:22:08] <biys> science?
[20:22:23] <assan> yes
[20:22:29] <assan> science is false
[20:22:38] <assan> school in general is a lie
[20:22:38] <biys> care to elaborate?
[20:22:53] <assan> okay
[20:23:22] <assan> number one, cosmology that school teaches is false
[20:23:43] <assan> number two, knowledge is what liberates people
[20:24:33] <assan> if am a slave master, the last thing i want to do is to is put knowledge into the hands of my subjects
[20:25:02] <assan> we see african countries with many schools yet no innovations
[20:25:24] <assan> when i studied in the us, i realized that higher knowledge is a secret
[20:25:51] <biys> yikes
[20:25:54] <assan> so basically when we getting into the realms of patents then we talking classified
[20:26:03] <darklambda> does the higher knowledge being bestowed the lizard people? :-)
[20:26:14] *** Joins: Treefingers (~Glassbox@34.162.189.80.dyn.plus.net)
[20:26:39] <assan> so really if the break throughs are classified then what we talking about?
[20:26:53] <assan> but aside the break throughs being classified
[20:27:04] <assan> its called capitalism
[20:27:21] <assan> so the real aim of science knowledge is industrialization
[20:27:45] <assan> but industries and schools don't share a mutual knowledge transfer
[20:27:56] <assan> industries keep their knowledge tight
[20:28:12] <assan> gm would sue tesla for using their knowledge
[20:28:41] <assan> so aside schools being pointless, we have the place where the real knowledge is being kept tight
[20:29:20] <assan> if their was real knowledge in school, africa would have learnt to build its own products by now
[20:29:57] <darklambda> i think they make their own baskets and slippers
[20:30:28] <assan> but this is above 500 years now or how ever long it is and we remain under total dependence of so called countries that have the intelligence to understand what newton meant by gravity
[20:30:33] <assan> i rest it here

[21:12:02] <biys> and i wouldn't say that the purpose of higher learning is to make you aware of the most current technologies/processes inclusively
[21:12:30] <biys> there's a significant amount of foundational knowledge that needs to be overcome first

[21:39:25] <krb> shit on yhwh, the new matrix movie was nice
[21:39:27] <Ungwelian> District heating, I think.
[21:39:35] <pussipupu> we have an air to water heat pump that was a drop in replacement for our oil boiler
[21:39:41] <Ungwelian> Sure we have radiators.
[21:39:52] <biys> disctrict heating means you have a central hot water provider.
[21:40:02] <biys> you get hot water pumped via public infastructure to your residence
[21:40:09] <Ungwelian> Yep.
[21:40:12] <krb> is it time for another round of simulation theory discussion?
[21:40:12] <pussipupu> Oh yeah, lots of district heating in towns in Finland, big old steam pipes

[21:40:42] <pussipupu> with steel mushrooms that melt the snow around them
[21:40:43] <Ungwelian> Also it's typical in Finland to have three-glass windows.
[21:40:43] <biys> incinerate
[21:40:53] <biys> triple pain with some kind of inert gas between them
[21:40:56] <Ungwelian> So the apartments are well insulated.
[21:40:59] <biys> to slow the thermal transfer
[21:41:18] <biys> usually argon
[21:41:19] <pussipupu> Generally as one single glazed pane and one double glazed
[21:41:32] <pussipupu> rather than as a single triple glazed pane
[21:41:47] <krb> i think most cooling comes from leaks. i suppose a better way would be to circulate the air fully and use filters and whatnot to clean the air itself
[21:42:01] <Ungwelian> I have no idea what's used to heat the water here.
[21:42:12] <Ungwelian> It's a city-owned slum apartment.
[21:42:33] <krb> probably some slaves in the basement burning wood
[21:42:37] <pussipupu> There are certainly rubbish incinerator district heating systems in Finland
[21:42:41] <Ungwelian> I wouldn't be surprised.
[21:43:05] <pussipupu> Oh yeah our house is also heated by burning tree corpses
[21:43:24] <Ungwelian> "Work rehabilitation" without pay, burning evil leftist publications for heat.
[21:43:53] <krb> im sure the politicians would burn nicely, with all their fat accumulation
[21:44:13] <Ungwelian> The mayor definitely.
[21:44:31] <biys> HAH
[21:44:35] <Ungwelian> He likes to call unemployed people "weeds".
[21:44:41] <biys> it's likely you import other nations trash and burn it

[21:44:48] <biys> incinerate
[21:44:50] <biys> beg your pardon
[21:45:14] <biys> you should turn your district heat off
