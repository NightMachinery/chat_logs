[01:10:45] <vdamewood> flakland: Your assumption is also wrong.
[01:11:06] <flakland> what part of MIT text requires source code modifications
[01:11:12] <KillerWasp> nomagno·êí yes, which is the reason that makes me suspect, with all this free software boom, companies take advantage of its popularity to release open source.
[01:11:13] <flakland> thats freedom 0 right?  
[01:11:17] <Soni> "This license shall be void if You bring a copyright lawsuit, related or unrelated to the Software, against any of the copyright holders."
[01:11:18] <flakland> or one of the freedoms
[01:11:18] * pyzozord is tired with irc arguments
[01:11:40] <vdamewood> flakland: Freedom 0 is the freedom to run a program for any purpose.
[01:12:07] <vdamewood> flakland; You appear to be arguing in bad faith.
[01:12:22] <flakland> i'm not i'm stating facts such as MIT license doesn't require you publish modifications
[01:12:36] <Soni> (the only license that works, really)
[01:12:38] <nomagno> pyzozord: Dumb arguments are part of life. No need to be disillusioned, enjoy the moment :P
[01:12:41] <flakland> you are all confused it seems.
[01:12:55] <vdamewood> flakland: You aren't listening to what others are saying.
[01:12:59] <Soni> "This software shall only be used in violation of this license." also works too
[01:13:01] <nomagno> ^
[01:13:06] <flakland> because i have personally spent hours reading the licenses in question

[01:13:59] <nomagno> You got me
[01:14:14] <vdamewood> flakland: Now. Either pay attention to what others are saying when you argue with them, or drop the subject.
[01:14:20] <flakland> no think for a second, if you can't access the source code of a MIT program, is it free software?

[01:25:20] <apotheon> 21:53 < flakland> MIT itself is not free software
[01:25:21] <DPA> free software is about having the source code, and ensuring people keep access to the source code, when others make changes. That's what copyleft is for, and mit is lacking it.

[01:25:36] <apotheon> flakland: I'm not making this up.  It's on the fucking FSF and GNU websites.

[01:26:37] <flakland> go join #fsf or #gnu and tell them that MIT is free software
[01:26:38] <apotheon> flakland: You seem to think it's not a free software license if it's legally possible to not distribute source.  I saw that.  If you want to think of it that way, fine, but understand that . . .
[01:26:39] <KillerWasp> nomagno·êí i read all the lines.

[01:27:19] <DPA> A free software license and free software are two different things. MIT source code is free software, but that doesn't mean derived software is free software.
[01:27:29] <apotheon> I'm more likely to believe the FSF and GNU than people who hang out in community channels when trying to understand what the FSF and GNU official orgs say.
[01:27:35] <KillerWasp> with MIT licence*
[01:27:40] <apotheon> . . . because if the orgs say it, that's the best evidence that's what the orgs say.
[01:27:42] <flakland> the four freedoms are what you must consider
[01:27:48] <nomagno> mrig: physics, craft, and math are all built in to humans to some degree so its an unfair question
[01:27:53] <apotheon> mrig: no
[01:28:31] <KillerWasp> but what happened with the author duties?

[01:29:02] <nomagno> Craft might be a bit younger, but the Australopithecus still threw rocks around, so close enough
[01:29:19] <vdamewood> nomagno: You get the right to run software from the license, not implicitly.
[01:29:40] <nomagno> Killer: You can add your name to the license if you make modifications, because you become a copyright holder for your modifications
[01:30:00] <nomagno> The notice is still preserved, or at least the information the notice contained
[01:30:00] <vdamewood> ^ Just make sure to make it a separate copyright statement.
[01:30:18] <apotheon> Physics, engineering, and crafts as practices and bodies of knowledge are not built in; they're discerned and systemized.
[01:30:29] <KillerWasp> i see.
[01:30:33] <apotheon> The urges that lead to these things, however, *are* built in.
[01:30:46] <KillerWasp> well, like no much difference between MIT and GPL. :/

[01:37:30] <jkk> people count prior to algerba
[01:37:31] <apotheon> mrig: or maybe you already know number theory, I'm not trying to imply anything about your knowledge
[01:37:38] <vdamewood> KillerWasp: For requirements. The MIT licenses, for example, requires that you reproduce the copyright statement, license text, and warranty disclaimer in any copies you make. The GPL requires that modified forms also be licenses under the GPL, and that you provide source code, among other things.
[01:37:45] <mrig> Right yes birds count, and also speak ...
[01:38:11] <KillerWasp> oh.
[01:38:23] <apotheon> . . . and crows, it turns out, are smarter than some humans.
[01:38:23] <nomagno> The MIT requires that you include the MIT license in MIT licensed software

[01:38:33] <pyzozord> apotheon: what did you mean by math derives from philosophy
[01:38:37] <vdamewood> KillerWasp: This means, for example, that if I make an MIT licensed software tool, Apple can copy it, build it for macOS, and put it into macOS, and all they have to do is copy those things into their legal notices document.
[01:38:46] <mrig> apotheon: sure yes a certain amount.
[01:39:11] <vdamewood> KillerWasp: But if I make a GPL-licensed tool, Apple can take it, build it for macOS, and they have to provide users the source code too, somehow, and allow users to use modified forms of it.
[01:39:56] <apotheon> pyzozord: Philosophy, "love of wisdom", is in essence the seeking of truth.  To pursue truth, one must develop standards for recognizing it and describing it.  Every systematic intellectual tool for doing these things is developed as an act of philosophy.

[01:41:37] <pyzozord> apotheon: ah yes I know that historically those were somehow connected
[01:41:45] <KillerWasp> I had already read that GPL requires publishing the source code yes or yes. You had also read that for the GPL you have to copy your license to the beginning of each source code file, whereas for MIT only one copy is enough.
[01:41:56] <KillerWasp> if i'm not wrong.
[01:41:59] <pyzozord> apotheon: I thought you meant something more formalized
[01:42:06] <apotheon> pyzozord: Every time a mathematician develops a new theory in math, that's philosophy.
[01:42:09] <KillerWasp> I had also*
[01:42:34] <apotheon> It's development of new tools for recognizing and describing truth.
[01:43:14] <arahael> KillerWasp: the gpl does not require that the source be published. only that it is available to those who obtain the product.  i think technically only needs to be by request.
[01:43:16] <DPA> "You had also read that for the GPL you have to copy your license to the beginning of each source code file" Technically, yes. In practice, no.
[01:43:19] <pyzozord> apotheon: I think in ancient greece, "philosopher" was kind of like todays "academic" in some sense
[01:43:29] <vdamewood> KillerWasp: Not exactly. The licenses themselves don't require you to put the license in the source code, but you do need to identify which license applies, and there are legal reasons to do it in each source file. Convention is to include the full MIT license at the beginning of the source, and a notice at the beginning for the GPL.
[01:43:34] <pyzozord> or "scientists"
[01:43:53] <pyzozord> not sure what the difference between "academic" and "scientist" is
[01:44:06] <vdamewood> arahael: Actually, if it's by request, then *everyone* has to be able to receive the source.
[01:44:11] <nomagno> It was certainly the closest term
[01:44:13] <apotheon> pyzozord: That's because in those days basically all academics were philosophers.
[01:44:28] <apotheon> pyzozord: Now, many academics are basically just rules-followers.
[01:44:46] <arahael> vdamewood: it's been a while since i checked, isn't it only "everyone" if it's a public product that is available to everyone?
[01:44:59] <pyzozord> apotheon: but in some sense saying that "math derives from philosophy" is the same as saying "math is a scientific field"
[01:45:07] <mrig> I would sill hold that engineering is ancient, which is the thought that I'd had in mind; Right think I see better what you mean now nomagno.
[01:45:15] <pyzozord> apotheon: at least that's how I understand what you meant
[01:45:16] <vdamewood> arahael: It depends on what you mean by 'public'
[01:45:32] <DPA> There are also SPDX license identifiers / headers. They are just one, machine readable line, identifying a license. It was made to simplify things & make copyright stuff machine readable: https://spdx.org/licenses/

[01:45:32] <bayaz> Title: SPDX License List | Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX) 
[01:45:38] <pyzozord> apotheon: I thought maybe you meant so forms of logic, or some methods
[01:45:48] <arahael> vdamewood: it's still distribution to that worker.
[01:46:05] <flakland> it's not actually everyone only customers/end-users
[01:46:07] <vdamewood> arahael: Not in the wording of the GPL (v3), then it's 'propogation'.
[01:46:11] <apotheon> Scientists who perform real science contribute to the greater project of philosophy by seeking truth.  Those who just learn a bunch of rules and break no ground as well as contributing nothing to others' efforts to do so are, I'd argue, not much in the way of scientists.

[01:50:47] <KillerWasp> mmmm. I understand that without any license, it automatically acquires only Copyright. Certain?
[01:51:06] <vdamewood> KillerWasp: Not sure what you mean there.
[01:51:17] <apotheon> 22:20 < mrig> In fact you could argue that reverse engineering really is engineering at its best.
[01:51:21] <vdamewood> KillerWasp: Without a license, though, you have no right to do anything with software, not even run it.
[01:51:26] <nomagno> KillerWasp: Correct, under modern law if you don't include a license full rights are reserved

[01:51:28] <apotheon> mrig: In some respects, at least, I'm down with that.
[01:51:34] <mrig> I should add ... such as when an engineer is inspired by nature.
[01:51:35] <DPA> CC0 isn't exactly a software license. I don't think creative commons recommends using it for software.  I don't know the other ones.
[01:51:51] <KillerWasp> vdamewood·êí That all code created and binaries compiled is Copyright, even if you do not use licenses or Copyright.
[01:52:12] <vdamewood> KillerWasp: That's why all the software out there comes with a EULA.

[01:52:38] <apotheon> virtuous, in the Greek sense: arete
[01:52:43] <nomagno> DPA: CC0 is a public domain-like license. It can be applied to anything, but public domain is not always the best idea with software
[01:53:11] <apotheon> DPA: CC0 is a free software license.  The rest of the CC licenses are not suitable for software, but CC0 is.
[01:53:28] <vdamewood> KillerWasp: And yes, copyright is automatic. According to the Berne Convention (and thus the copyright law of any country that has ratified it), copyright protection is automatic upon creation.
[01:53:29] <mrig> apotheon: yes I'm with you there, more often the case I am sure.
[01:53:32] <apotheon> The fact it's also suitable for non-software things doesn't mean it's not an open source and free software license.
[01:54:05] <apotheon> DPA: CC specifically says it doesn't recommend its non-CC0 licenses for software.
[01:54:42] <apotheon> Of the other licenses I mentioned, I thing GAPL may be the only one that isn't in SPDX.
[01:54:48] <vdamewood> Yeah, CC is fine with CC0 for software.
[01:55:14] <apotheon> CC0 is the only CC license I'd ever consider using, too.

[01:57:52] <apotheon> Unlicense's phrasing is a bit weird, but ultimately seems to resolve to what it intends just because it's kind of absurd to find some other meaning.  Same with WTFPL.  Each has some complications across jurisdictions, though.
[01:58:26] <vdamewood> Yeah, those jurisdictional complications re a problem though.
[01:58:27] <apotheon> Any PD dedication attempt runs into problems in some jurisdictions.
[01:58:29] <nomagno> The Free Software Foundation and the GNU Project are very responsible at working precisely for what they were created

[01:59:22] <apotheon> I'd say, rather, "use a copyfree license".
[01:59:30] <apotheon> At least that has a definition.
[01:59:39] <vdamewood> apotheon: Just go with one of: BSD 2-clause, BSD-3clause, MIT, zlib, or ISC.
[01:59:55] <vdamewood> pretend I was consistent in how I typed that.

[02:00:28] <hans> apotheon, like CC0?
[02:00:32] <apotheon> Zlib has issues (though more minor than WTFPL and Unlicense).
[02:00:43] <vdamewood> apotheon: Oh, really?
[02:01:04] <apotheon> If you want something about as close as possible without the problems, try GAL or SAL.
[02:01:30] <vdamewood> Meh, I'm still fine with the other four licenses.
[02:01:38] <apotheon> The biggest problem with Zlib is a bookkeeping clause.
[02:01:43] <vdamewood> Hell, three of them are basically the same.
[02:01:49] <hans> afaik CC0 is basically Unlicense but written in Legalese, and Unlicense is basically CC0 written in English
[02:02:08] <nomagno> apotheon: I don't see the issue with that clause
[02:02:11] <apotheon> BSD3 (aka Revised BSD License) includes an unnecessarily complicating clause.
[02:02:24] <apotheon> . . . but in practice it doesn't seem to do anything dangerous, from what I've seen.

[03:51:06] <apotheon> Guest80: In practice, many real-world programs are too complicated to reasonably try to represent in a flowchart, but in theory at least the vast majority should be representable in a meaningful way.
[03:51:24] <apotheon> . . . and all should be representable in *some* way in a flowchart.
[03:51:46] <flakland> yeah sure draw a diamond and write the name of your program in the middle
[03:51:53] <apotheon> I think a small, old-school flowchart template had enough symbols on it for Turing completeness.

[04:42:52] <vdamewood> As in, what exactly is the 'common denominator' you speak of.

[04:46:37] <InPhase> Raziel: If you can remember that the two are "numerator" and "denominator", the easiest way to remember is that "numerator" sounds like "number", and the top works like normal numbers.  e.g. 5 is 5/1.

[07:33:52] <droid3> I realize pdf is a vector base graphic aka not a raster so it doesnt loose quality if you zoom in or out.

[07:34:28] *** Quits: Sadale (~Sadale@user/sadale) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[07:34:34] <droid3> So i am thinking thats why publishers like having the cover art of a book and also the internals of the book in pdf format as a final file format before print.
[07:35:03] <droid3> Because they can print to any trim size without sacrificing image quality.
[07:35:29] *** Joins: CodeSpelunker (~CodeSpelu@user/codespelunker)
[07:35:32] <droid3> But is there any reason why if i embed images in my word document and export the whole document as pdf?
[07:35:34] *** Joins: password2 (~password8@user/password2)
[07:36:04] <droid3> The pictures should be as good of quality for latex images if there generated to pdf anyway for the word document??? Right ?
[07:36:59] <droid3> I mean you could lose quality if you resized the latex images in the word document before you exported the word document into a pdf (vector based file format)
[07:37:57] <droid3> but if your careful and dont resize much then once you generate the pdf you wouldnt lose quality for the print so at this point. 
[07:38:45] <droid3> If my logic is correct it really wont make much difference in quality between using latex editor /having the skills to write the complete book in latex editors. Vs just a word processor exported as a pdf anyway.
[07:39:42] <droid3> I mean i could generate the latex statements as svg images that i embed into the word processor software as well. And this would even cut down the issue of resizing before the exporting to pdf.

[07:42:19] <droid3> For the publishers/printing companies
[07:42:58] <droid3> And they should have no problem with the pdf of 1) the cover 2) internals of the book
[07:43:06] *** Sadale_ is now known as Sadale
[07:43:16] <droid3> if it was to go to print/get published someday.
[07:45:51] <droid3> vector graphics are vector graphics and resizing is not an issue to any size interms of quality. So PDF and word documents with svg images exported to eventually pdf is equally fine.

[07:48:37] <droid3> so now i think i brainstormed out a solution to latex/tex work around with just svg/word doc to pdf
[07:49:09] <droid3> to get the same end result quality and not have to be a superuser of latex/tex editing
[07:49:28] <droid3> with latex/tex editors
[07:49:45] <d3x0r> droid3 at some point you have a sample from real life that is finite resolution .  so you accept eventually maybe that 10kdpi is just enough.

[10:43:03] <jollygood2> arahael, how has your haskell code bitrotted? You can no longer compile code using old ghc/packages?
[10:44:31] <arahael> jollygood2: I have two systems - one on linux x86_64, where I updated the system, then some months later, tried running my ghc's.  But it's nixos, and stack can no-longer figure out what ghc I have.  That's one system.
[10:45:48] <arahael> jollygood2: The other is my mac, but I've since updated my llvm to version 13 - the default version in XCode today.  Which requires GHC 9.2.1 which is still not yet fully supported by the community - which they're in the process of adapting to it.  I was running the older versions under emulation - but back then I think my llvm was also prior to version 13.
[10:46:04] <jollygood2> hmm, I'm not sure how that is the case? stack just installs its own local ghc that is needed to compile the project
[10:46:27] <arahael> jollygood2: Yes, but the specific ghc it wants isn't part of the nixos channel.
[10:47:14] <arahael> jollygood2: Finally, my system runs aarch64, which I guess still has a kink or two.
[10:48:43] <jollygood2> arahael, ok, I don't get it, probably because I don't use nixos. on plain linux and windows stack installs and uses as many local copies of ghc as it needs to compile all the projects you have
[10:48:53] <arahael> jollygood2: nixos is...  Different.
[10:51:50] <arahael> jollygood2: On nixos, it can only install nix stuff, and eg, for whatever reason, my channel didn't have ghc865.

[10:52:45] <arahael> arash: Generally it's learning the concepts that are hard. The syntax is usually simple.  It will be easier to learn the second langauge if it shares most of the same concepts.

[20:27:28] <droid3> hey guys quick question is there any snapshot program that supports saving as a vector graphic aka like svg. Most of the time when i take a screen image or snapshot i have it in jpg, png , gif ,...etc raster formats and have to convert to a vector format.
[20:28:09] <KillerWasp> I'm considering giving them to the public in exchange for their souls.
[20:28:26] <droid3> I was wondering if there is a screenshot/snapshot program that also can save as a vector graphic. Because sometimes from resizing before the conversion 
[20:29:04] *** Quits: j1mu5 (~j1mu5@user/j1mu5) ()
[20:29:05] <droid3> you loose some quality downsizing isnt really an issue but upsizing is where you lose some quality before the conversion.
[20:29:06] <KillerWasp> droid3·êí nope. the screen always's a bitmap.
[20:29:08] <droid3> Possible
[20:30:01] <droid3> yum so i think the way to get around this is just take a screen shot convert it first to svg then resize it dont do the resizing in between
[20:31:07] <droid3> Ok KillerWasp think i all set just dont do resizing until you got it in svg , pdf ,..etc format
[20:31:39] <d3x0r> there's a few svg-editors out there in JS that work offline

[20:34:15] <droid3> yup so i am all set with the latex/tex editor issue. If i dont learn the latex/tex editor i can just do it by this trick of converting the latex statements to .svg and embedding them in a word document and generating the pdf from that.

[20:35:19] <Bombe> A totally sensible solution!

[23:05:49] <pyzozord> nomagno having a dynamic destination address seems quite useful
[23:07:19] <pyzozord> but actually I'm thinking maybe static jumps should be enough. The dynamic jumps lead to very dynamic programming (I don't mean the DP) which is very hard to follow

[23:08:01] <pyzozord> I'm not sure what my opinion on that is, but having ability to jump to an address that is stored in memory seems to be the foundation of all that
[23:09:09] <pyzozord> that might be kind of annoying to not have ability to pass function addresses and store them in dictionaries
[23:09:39] <pyzozord> but maybe most of it could be achieved statically with some more involved compiler

[23:10:08] <pyzozord> but then again if you have most of it, you have most of the thing that is hard to follow
[23:10:38] <pyzozord> i wonder if Dijkstra had an opinion about that in stuctured programming
[23:11:56] <pyzozord> just thinking out loud, not even sure if any of this makes sense at all or is smart

[23:55:00] <nomagno> pyzpzord: just pushed a change that specifies the assembly format, and the pseudoinstructions "START", "END", " CALL". Its basically just like a mini mini mini mini mini preprocessor that replaces START with a jmp to after the subroutine (so it is ignored if encountered normally), END with a jmp to an address, and CALL with a set with the next instruction to that address, and a jmp to the start of the subroutine

[23:55:16] <nomagno> So yeah, its trivial to implement
[23:55:47] <nomagno> Jumping to addresses is a fairly simple thing to implement, since in my CPU I just turn back the program counter
[23:55:48] <nomagno> Magic!
