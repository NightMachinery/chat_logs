[01:29:06] <oriba> are there muttrc-files for testing of neomutt in development?
[01:29:20] <oriba> for me a set of hooks would be nice.
[01:30:06] <oriba> but I so often see Issues on GitHub, where rc-file settings are mentioned
[01:30:46] <oriba> maybe a test setup / test-rc-file for development purposes might be a good idea

[02:31:44] <oriba> reading the docs does not create settings and test environment.
[02:32:16] <oriba> I meant something like commands and setups and configs, that make it easy to do testing/logging/debugging
[02:33:53] <oriba> I don't want to use my regular mail folders for testing purposes, and to change the settings every time I peek ata different part of the neomutt code.
[02:34:38] <flatcap> hi oriba. just replying to your query/complaint :-)
[02:35:53] <oriba> flatcap: ok, waiting :-)
[02:39:20] <flatcap> done
[02:40:17] <flatcap> in case anyone else is interested in APIs: https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/issues/2646#issuecomment-1065981530
[02:40:20] <oriba> thx.
[02:40:23] <flatcap> np
[02:41:28] <flatcap> and yes, we could do with some more "targeted" sample config files
[02:42:38] <oriba> "Command::parse()" looks C++-ish
[02:43:03] <flatcap> yes, that's so that Doxygen recognises it
[02:43:19] <flatcap> but it's effectively the same
[02:43:34] <flatcap> struct X { function(); }  vs class X { public: function(); }

[16:44:21] <dcpurton> Another random quirk. It seems to be possible to put most of the readline shortcuts into macros, except for \Cg
[16:44:27] <dcpurton> That's odd
[16:45:06] <dcpurton> It just inserts ^G
[16:45:59] <dcpurton> (Not that you'd ever probably want to actually do that. I tried to put it in to demonstrate the segfault)
[16:48:47] <flatcap> you can put the function equivalents in, which can be useful, e.g. <kill-line>
[16:48:49] <flatcap> https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/blob/master/functions.c#L247-L270
[16:52:46] <dcpurton> oh interesting
[16:53:01] <dcpurton> but there's nothing there for ctrl+g is there?
[16:53:28] <dcpurton> like <abort-query>
[16:56:56] <flatcap> hmm... no
[16:57:06] <flatcap> <kill-line><enter> would have the same effect
[16:58:43] *** Joins: tyler (~tyler82@85.255.234.236)
[16:58:49] <dcpurton> yes, hence the \Cu<enter> option I went with
[16:59:03] <dcpurton> maybe that's why \Cg doesn't work?
[17:00:35] <flatcap> ctrl-g is only special to mutt_getch()
[17:01:10] * flatcap wonders how a generic <abort> function would behave
[17:02:31] <dcpurton> for some reason I use it a lot
[17:02:59] <dcpurton> Ctrl+G that is
[17:03:37] <bremner> secret emacs user...
[17:05:27] <flatcap> ah!  is that where it comes from?
[17:05:29] <dcpurton> haha. If so, it's from a long time ago I can't remember when I last used Emacs
[17:06:00] <bremner> flatcap: yep
[17:08:26] <flatcap> oh!  I see what I've done
[17:10:38] <flatcap> historically, if you did: <mail>john<complete-query>, then <tag-entry><tag-entry><tag-prefix><mail>
[17:11:05] <flatcap> then the query dialog would start a new mail with the selection
[17:11:17] <flatcap> that's on top of the original mail you were trying to compose
[17:12:11] <flatcap> _that_ feature is needed for the <query>, otherwise it's just losing the results
[17:13:25] <dcpurton> that set of key strokes except for <enter> instead of second <mail> is what I was trying to do earlier today
[17:14:36] <dcpurton> and minus the <tag-prefix> which used to be not needed, but I'm OK to put that in or use auto_tag = yes
[17:14:59] <flatcap> if you start with <mail> it works.  it drops back to the "To:" prompt
[17:15:16] <flatcap> I just need to tweak <query> to do the same
[17:17:16] <flatcap> now how am I going to do _that_? (rhetorical)
[17:18:13] <dcpurton> yes, but <F4> still gives wrong output

[23:21:29] <flatcap> yeah, that would probably make sense...
[23:22:40] <flatcap> struct Buffer is a relatively new so there's a lot of functions that deserve an upgrade
[23:23:03] *** Joins: gtms (~gtms@user/gtms)
[23:25:15] <oriba> can you provide/write mutt_buffer_log() ?
[23:26:41] <oriba> s/can/would/
[23:37:36] <flatcap> (sorry, a little busy/distracted this side)
[23:38:26] <flatcap> yes, I can't see any problems with that
[23:52:42] <oriba> should I open a Github issue?
[23:53:25] <flatcap> sure
[23:53:41] <oriba> ok
[23:53:46] <flatcap> I'm just have a look now, but it needs a bit of thought to handle the varargs
[23:55:31] <oriba> ok. I will remind you on the issue, just in case you are too busy for too long :-)
[23:56:25] <flatcap> :-)
