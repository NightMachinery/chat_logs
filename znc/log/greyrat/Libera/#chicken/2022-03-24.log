[01:51:25] <siiky> howdy
[01:52:01] <sukrit_> could you help me with running scheme files using emacs
[01:53:22] <Menchers> invoking a Scheme interpreter from emacs?
[01:53:33] <siiky> I personally can't (I don't program in emacs), but others may be able to, and I think there's a page about that on the wiki somewhere
[01:53:36] <Menchers> I don't know emacs but I know it can't run scheme directly
[01:53:42] <Menchers> it uses elisp
[01:53:51] <Menchers> and I don't know how to invoke external programs from it
[01:54:24] <Menchers> unless I'm wrong and it includes guile these days
[01:54:37] <Menchers> I know emacs itself is still in elisp
[01:55:06] <siiky> I think this is the page: https://wiki.call-cc.org/emacs
[01:55:07] * Menchers notes that he's in #chicken and invoking csc/csi is probably what was being asked about
[01:56:09] <sukrit_> no im asking about actually executing scm files from within emacs
[01:56:41] <sukrit_> i can already invoke the chicken interpreter using geiser
[02:05:47] <siiky> I don't know what that means, but if you can call csi with arguments specified by you, you may be able to run the script: `csi -s file.scm`
[02:06:01] <siiky> but again, I don't use emacs, I don't even know what geiser is
[02:06:31] <siiky> and I don't know if that (csi -s) suits your needs

[20:26:11] <amazigh> how do we call people practicing chicken scheme?
[20:26:35] <amazigh> (I am trying to make a great entrance ;)
[20:26:59] <amazigh> nvm.
[20:27:12] <amazigh> While working on feu scheme-live, I had various troubles with chicken
[20:27:13] <ente> chickeneers
[20:27:23] <amazigh> s/various/several/
[20:28:04] <ente> why did the chicken cross the road?
[20:28:06] <amazigh> scheme-live was a (apparantly) a fork of R7RS (with which I disagree strongly) but that is how it was preceived by many
[20:28:20] <amazigh> ^^
[20:28:30] <ente> because it was running from csi :P
[20:28:41] <amazigh> ahah
[20:29:01] <amazigh> so the goal of scheme-live, according to me, was to build libraries portable across several scheme including chicken
[20:29:23] <amazigh> and later, push them to SRFI, and possibly to R7RS-large
[20:30:26] <amazigh> some people around helped to make the JSON library work.
[20:31:13] <amazigh> I am looking for the example problem I have in mind
[20:31:47] <wasamasa> did you mean: snow-fort?
[20:32:02] <amazigh> wasamasa: no ;)
[20:32:28] <amazigh> so, the test suite that includes a json lib, runs in ~2 min at most on ten scheme
[20:32:33] <wasamasa> why not?
[20:32:53] <amazigh> but chicken runs in 5 mins: https://github.com/scheme-live/live/runs/4591005171?check_suite_focus=true
[20:33:07] <amazigh> bah! the log is gone
[20:33:10] <wasamasa> lol
[20:33:21] <wasamasa> given your modus operandi, I'm not exactly surprised
[20:33:30] <amazigh> basically, csc will print a lot of messages that slow down the test suite
[20:33:56] <amazigh> wasamasa: mal function! need input!
[20:34:54] <amazigh> the messages were like: `foobar` is already imported, re-importing it from `quux`
[20:37:33] <amazigh> wasamasa: what does modus operandi entails? like the scheme-live project is doomed?
[20:37:51] <wasamasa> your way of working
[20:38:01] <amazigh> wasamasa: please explain
[20:38:04] <wasamasa> announce something, work frantically on it, then it magically disappears
[20:38:12] <Zipheir> "Intended goals"
[20:38:24] <wasamasa> vandusen: work fast and break things
[20:38:25] <amazigh> that is lassi that disappeared.
[20:38:27] <vandusen> wasamasa: The answer: yes, obviously, can we all MOVE PAST this please??
[20:38:44] <wasamasa> it became obvious to me when I worked on the okvs stuff
[20:39:06] <wasamasa> it used to be there, then it's gone
[20:39:18] <Zipheir> wasamasa: You're correct.  It seems "modus operandi" is often used differently here in the US.
[20:39:20] <amazigh> wasamasa: we already discussed that. You mis-understood (I take that as my fault), how SRFI-167 works.
[20:39:34] <wasamasa> like, docs used to be there, then they were gone
[20:39:47] <amazigh> wasamasa: docs were crap
[20:39:48] <wasamasa> blog post used to be there, then it was gone (screw compatibility links)
[20:39:55] <wasamasa> implementation used to be there, gone
[20:39:58] <amazigh> all those were crap work
[20:40:02] <Zipheir> amazigh: You tend to nuke stuff suddenly, I think wasamasa means.
[20:40:05] <wasamasa> yes
[20:40:06] <wasamasa> why
[20:40:13] <amazigh> various reasons
[20:40:35] <amazigh> main reason is that I am unhappy with my work, I want to do better, so I nuke it, to help me to better
[20:40:37] <wasamasa> why try to excite people, then repeatedly let them down
[20:40:45] <wasamasa> you become the boy who cries wolf
[20:40:51] <amazigh> i recognize that
[20:41:23] <wasamasa> no need to contribute to the link rot of the web
[20:41:51] <amazigh> btw, my old blog is still there in the archive at the same location, the github repositories were nuked
[20:42:20] <wasamasa> what I see is someone whose work I cannot rely on
[20:42:24] <dTal> you shouldn't nuke stuff
[20:42:46] <wasamasa> so if you announce something with no obvious benefit over previous work such as snow-fort, then I just lol
[20:42:49] <dTal> if you want to deprecate it, add a note at the top of the README in fat capital letters
[20:43:10] <amazigh> that is what I did for SRFI-167
[20:43:10] <wasamasa> we're a small community, we cannot afford to regularly throw everything we did away
[20:43:25] <wasamasa> yeah, but only because they forced you to
[20:43:36] <wasamasa> you couldn't just make it vanish
[20:46:10] <amazigh> you do not know all the story
[20:47:22] <amazigh> I was said in professional settings I have many projects but none succeed in terms of github stars which gives the impression of a graveyard, and that I am trying too hard with little benefit, which is also harming my reputation in the industry
[20:47:43] <wasamasa> lol
[20:47:54] <amazigh> so another reason to nuke them was like: I will do what my collegue do: do nothing.
[20:48:15] <amazigh> true story.
[20:48:43] <amazigh> Those people from the industry, do not know how FOSS works
[20:49:36] <wasamasa> so what?
[20:49:40] <wasamasa> work is work and scheme is scheme
[20:52:59] <amazigh> good convo.
[20:53:37] <amazigh> here is an example of the output I am speaking about: https://github.com/scheme-live/live/runs/4881535843?check_suite_focus=true
[20:53:46] <amazigh> click on the `check` mark
[20:53:50] <amazigh> scroll a little
[20:54:00] <amazigh> > Warning: redefinition of imported syntax binding: cond-expand
[20:54:11] <amazigh> > Warning: Deprecated identifier `current-milliseconds'
[20:54:25] <wasamasa> try -no-warnings
[20:54:30] <amazigh> ah!
[20:54:36] <Zipheir> amazigh: I guess the question is whether your goal is to make something (however small) that people can use, or to generate popularity/attention.
[20:55:03] <wasamasa> which is used with csi apparently
[20:55:06] <Zipheir> (They *can* overlap, but they can also be mutually defeating.)
[20:55:33] <wasamasa> so you'd need to set csc flags via environment variable instead
[20:55:52] <wasamasa> export CSC_OPTIONS='-no-warnings'
[21:03:26] <amazigh> Zipheir: part of the problems I identified are A) that I have too big, and B) too many projects, C) I jump from one project to another, and D) I aim for somekind of perfection. Indeed, I believe Scheme is a good medium for programming, and strongly believe SRFI-167-like library is a good thing, I would like it to be more popular.
[21:13:01] <Zipheir> amazigh: Yes.  But you know what I mean, right?  Things in Scheme aren't likely to be all that popular in the first place; so trying to write popular stuff specifically in Scheme can be self-defeating, I think.
[21:14:18] <Zipheir> I'm saying these seem like semi-contradictory goals.
[21:15:49] <Zipheir> If my goal were specifically to do something popular, I'd just use some very popular language sight-unseen and try to implement the language I want within it. :)
[21:20:16] * amazigh thinking
[21:23:24] <amazigh> I think it is too complex for a IRC convo. I will think about it further... and write about it in another medium. BUT I (again) take well deserved feedback, and will not nuke my projects anymore.
