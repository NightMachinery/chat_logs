[13:15:41] <piou> Joanna: yep, such horse was called a hack. But there are many other meaning and I think the most relevant one to us is the idea of chopping roughly since it likely decanted into "doing anything in a rough, approximate way" (eg: a hack can be a swing of a baseball bat) then probably leading to the association to tinkerers that do things in a quick and dirty way

[23:49:04] <[iz]> so you have the right idea here, but what does seperating services into containers do for you in this context?

[23:51:24] <mats1> job insecurity, gotta keep up with the latest hotness or else
