[06:20:52] <Jonno_FTW> yeah one sec
[06:21:09] <Rockwood> FunkyBob, recently my scooty was stolen
[06:21:26] <FunkyBob> that's gotta suck
[06:21:40] <FunkyBob> I'm expecting my next couple of days to be rough, as I just got my second Pfizer jab
[06:21:53] <Rockwood> i got big loss (no insurance too) and looking for another
[06:22:26] <Rockwood> pfizer single's dose vaccine?
[06:22:36] <FunkyBob> no, it's a two-dose
[06:22:41] <FunkyBob> I think it's J&J that's single dose
[06:22:57] <Rockwood> people taking that too?
[06:22:59] <Jonno_FTW> ok here's my problem https://codepen.io/jonno_ftw/pen/LYyVQzg when hovering there's no red fill
[06:23:36] <Rockwood> FunkyBob, https://codesandbox.io/s/material-demo-forked-y24r9?file=/demo.js i got bit success
[06:23:50] <Rockwood> now i wanna do dropdowns
[06:24:07] <FunkyBob> Jonno_FTW:   color: red;
[06:24:16] <Jonno_FTW> that does it
[06:24:19] <FunkyBob> since you're using currentColor
[06:24:28] <Jonno_FTW> ah
[06:24:41] <Jonno_FTW> makes sense
[06:24:54] <Rockwood> FunkyBob, now i am thinking about dropdowns
[06:25:54] <Rockwood> how to call menuitems function for generate dropdown on children?
[06:26:07] <Rockwood> FunkyBob, ^^
[06:26:08] <FunkyBob> you've amde a bit of a hash of it, Rockwood ....
[06:26:14] <FunkyBob> my Menu was your MenuHandler...
[06:26:23] <Rockwood> ok
[06:26:24] <FunkyBob> and you seem to have lost your styling
[06:26:34] <FunkyBob> I can't see the older versions, so I don't know what you had
[06:26:49] <Rockwood> i have backup 2 secs
[06:28:16] <Rockwood> https://gist.github.com/Cyberiaaxis/c34ad2c0963998d1bb20c30a27ec4104  and you suggested https://dpaste.org/cBw0#L14
[06:29:13] <FunkyBob> so you need this back:         <div className="hoverMenu">
[06:29:20] <Rockwood> okay
[06:30:03] <Rockwood> const MenuHandler = (props) => {  in <--
[06:30:49] <FunkyBob> erk
[06:30:59] <FunkyBob> yeah, was just untangling all your compnents...
[06:31:23] <Rockwood> ok
[06:31:35] <FunkyBob> ButtonWithMenu passes menuBar to a component which... doesn't give a shit what it's passed, it just passes all its props as a new prop??
[06:32:11] <FunkyBob> you're really struggling with this props thing, eh?
[06:34:20] <Rockwood> now props i clears to me
[06:34:32] <FunkyBob> not going by what's in your code
[06:35:21] <Rockwood> buttonwithmenu will go
[06:35:29] <Rockwood> i will remove tha
[06:36:18] <Rockwood> it will be the main not const MenuHandler = (props) => {
[06:36:30] <Rockwood> it will be the main const MenuHandler = (props) => {
[06:36:37] <FunkyBob> stop
[06:36:44] <FunkyBob> unpack the props
[06:36:45] <Rockwood> ok
[06:36:51] <Rockwood> where?
[06:36:54] <FunkyBob> everywhere
[06:37:04] <FunkyBob> don't just accept props... show which props the component expects
[06:37:29] <FunkyBob> so fir instance, a Menu needs items... so it would be : const Menu = ({ items }) => {
[06:39:54] <FunkyBob> you make your life difficult by choosing names top-down... instead of naming props for what they mean to that component
[06:42:30] <Rockwood> you are right
[06:44:25] <Rockwood> FunkyBob, can you make is correct? after that i can see my issues easily
[06:44:52] <FunkyBob> no. I gave you workable code, you should adapt that
[06:45:05] <FunkyBob> I've been burned too many times by people saying "can you just make it work?"

[06:51:54] <FunkyBob> i've no idea if PHP has destructuring...
[06:52:35] <Rockwood> doesn't matter in my react
[06:52:46] <Rockwood> PHP is very differ
[06:52:55] <Rockwood> backend
[06:53:03] <Rockwood> and this is frontend
[06:54:38] <Rockwood> menuHandler should menu??
[06:54:43] <FunkyBob> yes, but you still seem to struggle with this idea... so was looking for an analogue in a more familiar language
[06:54:44] <Rockwood> i am talking about names
[06:55:44] <FunkyBob> ok... I don't understand what you mean by "menuHandler should menu??"
[06:55:48] <FunkyBob> since menu is not a verb
[06:57:16] <Rockwood> https://codesandbox.io/s/material-demo-forked-y24r9?file=/demo.js:0-5379 i changed names looks more clear i think
[06:57:48] <FunkyBob> const MenuButtons = (items) => {
[06:57:58] <FunkyBob> you've told it to call its props object 'items'
[06:58:01] <Rockwood> just i changed names
[06:58:10] <Rockwood> now moving on more things
[06:58:24] <FunkyBob> but it's not items.. it's props... and _in_ there is items
[06:59:53] <FunkyBob> do you understand there's a HUGE difference between (items) =>   and ({ items }) =>   ?
[06:59:56] <Rockwood> so props holds items, am right? you are saying this
[07:00:05] <Rockwood> yes i understand it
[07:00:09] <FunkyBob> yes, this is basic React, like you see in their tutorial
[07:00:19] <FunkyBob> if you undrestand it, why is it wrong in almost every one of your components?

[07:09:01] <FunkyBob> no
[07:09:08] <FunkyBob> props is an object containing all your props
[07:09:17] <FunkyBob> ...items is treating it like an array
[07:09:49] <FunkyBob> and despite what PHP may teach you, they are different things
[07:10:01] <Rockwood> ok
[07:10:06] <Rockwood> https://codesandbox.io/s/material-demo-forked-y24r9?file=/demo.js
[07:10:19] <Rockwood> yes in PHP we have now ...

[07:10:49] <FunkyBob> I give up
[07:11:16] <Rockwood> yes i have done similar now as you suggested
[07:11:26] <FunkyBob> I don't see it in the code you linked
[07:11:43] <FunkyBob> those lines I just copied from  your link... they are both wrong in different ways
[07:12:43] <Rockwood> oops
[07:12:47] <Rockwood> lol
[07:12:53] <Rockwood> i am totally confuse
[07:13:18] *** Joins: bambanxx (~bambanx@181-163-32-112.baf.movistar.cl)
[07:13:44] <FunkyBob> your component is a function
[07:13:51] <FunkyBob> a function that accepts one argument: props
[07:14:05] <FunkyBob> props is an object whose members are the props passes to this component
[07:14:27] <FunkyBob> so when you do  <Menu items={topMenuBar} />  for instance
[07:14:32] *** Joins: matsaman (~matsaman@user/matsaman)
[07:14:49] <FunkyBob> it calls   Menu({ items: topMenuBar })
[07:14:59] <FunkyBob> [this is a simplification, but close enough]
[07:15:32] <FunkyBob> but you keep writing things like : function MenuButtons(items)
[07:15:49] <FunkyBob> as if props doesn't exist, and the code will magically match the props to the arguments you wrote
[07:16:01] <matsaman> ew
[07:16:20] <matsaman> react smell
[07:16:26] <FunkyBob> 'fraid so
[07:17:32] <matsaman> the 'rm' command fixes all react development issues

[07:32:16] <Rockwood> ok
[07:32:26] <Rockwood> 2 or 3??
[07:32:35] <Rockwood> means for use?

[07:34:06] <Rockwood> yes i have

[07:34:17] <FunkyBob> you have MenuButtons, Menulists, Menu, and MenuWithDropdowns...

[07:50:19] <Rockwood> should be "items"?
[07:50:29] <FunkyBob> and your usage does, too... where in the Menu function does it say it accepts props called `menuBar`, `openOnHover`, or `onSelected` ?

[07:53:52] <FunkyBob> items is what it neesd... menu items

[07:55:04] <FunkyBob> you called it props
[07:55:23] <Rockwood>               items={topMenuBar}
[07:55:31] <FunkyBob> irrelevant
[07:55:36] <FunkyBob> think only of the Menu component
[07:55:45] <FunkyBob> you called it props
[07:55:57] <FunkyBob> to the component, it accepts one property, called 'props'.... the way you've written it
[07:55:57] <Rockwood> ok
[07:56:06] <FunkyBob> that's how how I wrote it... so... why did you change it?
[07:56:11] <FunkyBob> you had a reason, a purpose... what was it?
[07:57:04] <Rockwood> oh okay
[07:57:37] <Rockwood> now --> function Menu({ items }) {
[07:58:05] <Rockwood> now my function looks like above
[07:58:30] <FunkyBob> no
[07:58:32] <FunkyBob> I want an answer!
[07:58:51] <FunkyBob> you changed it frm what I had... why?
[07:58:59] <FunkyBob> what was your understanding of why you changed it?
[07:59:08] <Rockwood> bcz i need all object once
[07:59:14] <FunkyBob> clearly there's some flaw in your understanding, and I can't find it if you hide it all from me
[07:59:18] <FunkyBob> you what?
[07:59:29] <Rockwood> topMenuBar
[07:59:36] <FunkyBob> what about it?
[07:59:56] <Rockwood> i wanna pass full topMenuBar variable values in
[08:00:07] <FunkyBob> it already handled that
[08:00:15] <FunkyBob> you're passing it as items... it accepted a prop called items
[08:00:19] <FunkyBob> but you cahanged that
[08:00:28] <FunkyBob> from { items } to { props } ... why?
[08:00:44] <Rockwood> really no reason
[08:00:58] <FunkyBob> so you're just trolling?
[08:01:03] <Rockwood> no
[08:01:09] <FunkyBob> ...
[08:01:10] <Rockwood> i was thinking
[08:01:35] <Rockwood> actually in examples of docs they are using props
[08:01:39] <FunkyBob> "I changed this now it doesn't work." "Why did you change it?" "No reason".... yeah, big fuck y ou energy there
[08:01:46] <Rockwood> in react
[08:01:56] <FunkyBob> are they using (props) or ({ props}) ?
[08:02:03] <FunkyBob> I'll bet you 10:1 they're using (props)
[08:02:22] <Rockwood> let me chk once again
[08:02:29] <FunkyBob> because when I checked the react docs earlier today, that's what they were using
[08:03:07] <Rockwood> https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#rendering-a-component
[08:03:16] <FunkyBob> function Welcome(props) {
[08:03:21] <Rockwood> yes
[08:03:39] <FunkyBob> so all that discussion about destructuring, and how (props) and ({props}) are different?
[08:03:44] <FunkyBob> and you saying you understood?
[08:03:48] <FunkyBob> that was all bullshit from you?
[08:03:57] <FunkyBob> you didn't undersetand at all?
[08:04:23] <Rockwood> in truly i am not clear 100%

[08:04:35] <FunkyBob> then SAY THAT WHEN I ASK

[08:04:59] <Rockwood> i was read it many times
[08:05:01] <FunkyBob> also... I asked why you changed it, you said no reason
[08:05:09] <FunkyBob> now you say.... because it looks more like the examples

[08:08:22] <FunkyBob> that's the name for what's being done in line 7
[08:08:42] <Rockwood> oh okay
[08:08:46] <Rockwood> 2 sec
[08:08:53] <FunkyBob> https://dpaste.org/QXXY
[08:09:04] <FunkyBob> I've added a 3rd case, because you'll often see that used too
[08:09:08] <Rockwood> my mistake is bigger
[08:09:21] <Rockwood> you hinted me now correct this
[08:09:39] <FunkyBob> you blindly changing names to the right ones is not learning... it's not correcting
[08:09:50] <FunkyBob> I could train a pet to do that
[08:12:41] <Rockwood> i am trying to  access wrong variable name there
[08:12:47] <Rockwood> dammit my eyes
[08:13:11] <Rockwood> that why my fault
[08:13:41] <Rockwood> storing in other and trying to access another
[08:16:17] <Rockwood> FunkyBob, yes works now
[08:16:27] <Rockwood> now i need to add css
[08:18:17] <Rockwood> FunkyBob, https://codesandbox.io/s/material-demo-forked-y24r9?file=/demo.js
[08:20:49] *** Quits: matsaman (~matsaman@user/matsaman) (Quit: leaving)
[08:21:16] <FunkyBob> no idea why you added div around the nav
[08:21:30] <FunkyBob> you need to add the original class to toe nav ... at least, when I did it all started working
[08:24:15] <Rockwood> https://codesandbox.io/s/material-demo-forked-y24r9?file=/demo.js done
[08:24:27] <Rockwood> no div there now
[08:24:56] <Rockwood> now i need second dropdown too
[08:25:02] <FunkyBob> ok, but, again... why did you add it?
[08:25:36] <Rockwood> for sub categories
[08:25:47] <Rockwood> added what?
[08:25:56] <FunkyBob> the div
[08:26:08] <FunkyBob> you keep making changes with no apparent rreasons
[08:26:08] *** Quits: jetchisel (jetchisel@user/jetchisel) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[08:26:14] <FunkyBob> when I ask for reasons, you just undo the changes
[08:26:17] <FunkyBob> it's not helping
[08:26:21] <Rockwood> for making a block
[08:26:31] <FunkyBob> you don't think a <nav> can do that?
[08:26:47] <Rockwood> before i wasn't using that
[08:27:00] <Rockwood> now its added yes it is also does
[08:27:13] <Rockwood> now i am using nav
[08:27:23] <Rockwood> not any kind of div there
[08:27:38] <FunkyBob> could have used either
[08:27:48] <FunkyBob> I used nav because semantically it's more descriptive
[08:27:57] <Rockwood> okay
[08:28:24] <Rockwood> so i need another loop for second dropdown?
[08:28:38] <FunkyBob> not with my code
[08:28:42] <Rockwood> children -> children
[08:28:48] <Rockwood> children's -> children
[08:29:12] <Rockwood> as per my topMenuBar
[08:30:16] <Rockwood> now i have to leave bcz i have to go my son's school
[08:30:21] <Rockwood> for meeting
[08:30:23] <Rockwood> lol
[08:30:28] <Rockwood> here i am children
[08:32:52] <Rockwood> is bad idea in recursively call on children's -> children (function MenuItem({ item }) {) ?
[08:33:43] <Rockwood> as per you css hint yesterday i thinking like this
[08:34:05] <Rockwood> .dropdown .dropdown {
[08:34:12] <Rockwood> what do you say?
[08:36:01] <Rockwood> anyway thanks cya

[18:52:21] <jwpapi> on mobile on the last picture if you click on the little "i" and then on photobreakdown, the tooltip is hiding behind the footer, I tried to change the z-indexes, but somehow I can’t do anything to get it in front
[18:52:27] <jwpapi> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/CbGnSjdH/image.png
[18:55:10] <jwpapi> Oh I figured it’s a problem with `#primary` and overflow hidden
[18:55:37] <jwpapi> I only want to hide overflow on the x axes, but just `overflow-x: hidden` does seem to behave like `overflow: hidden`
