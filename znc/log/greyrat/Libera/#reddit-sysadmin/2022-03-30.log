[09:58:19] <SirSceptalot> don't plotters work in a different fashion, to be specific by drawing lines with an implement?
[09:58:43] <SirSceptalot> genuine question, not trying to be a smartass
[09:59:07] <Cl0udNinja> idk tbh. I've not seen/used a plotter in a long time
[10:00:29] <Cl0udNinja> doesnt seem like it, seems to be the same idea as an inkjet
[10:00:48] <Kiernian> The term has been watered down. Océ, Xerox, Kip, et al have been calling giant laser printers "plotters" for decades.
[10:00:59] <Cl0udNinja> also true
[10:01:30] <Cl0udNinja> someone threw a plotter away near me a few years ago, I somewhat regret not taking it, but there wouldnt be any room for it
[10:01:42] <SirSceptalot> the question then becomes: what do you call the printer-like devices that use a pen/pencil-like drawing implement?
[10:02:11] <Cl0udNinja> shitty plotters?
[10:02:19] <SirSceptalot> lol
[10:02:27] <Cl0udNinja> unless you're talkin about like EEG plotters
[10:02:36] <Cl0udNinja> but they use a pin and heat afaik

[10:02:41] <SirSceptalot> i'm not
[10:03:04] <SirSceptalot> I remember having a large (A2 or A1) plotter when I was in high school that worked with pens
[10:03:24] <SirSceptalot> they're used for large technical drawings and blueprints as far as I know
[10:03:27] <Kiernian> large format drafting pen plotters? I don't even know if they make those anymore

[10:04:46] <Cl0udNinja> actually.. that reminds me of the huge mechanical computer plotter video i saw a while ago.. let me see if i can find it

[17:37:43] <JollyRgrs> i mainly just follow what she tells me to do
[17:37:49] <vinrock> i learned how to cook from watching the original Iron Chef
[17:37:53] <vinrock> im not even kidding
[17:38:02] <estranger> JollyRgrs she's on a non toxic, all green, organic kick
[17:38:04] <vinrock> that shit taught me all the basics i needed
[17:38:08] <fritzwastaken> lol nice. My wife decided to be keto a few years ago, and since she wanted to eat that diet, she started cooking everything
[17:38:15] <vinrock> oh sweet
[17:38:17] <JollyRgrs> i learned how to roll up a good burrito from the chef at my old job and moe's
[17:38:26] <fritzwastaken> so I stocked the kitchen with gadgets and a pantry of everything she needs
[17:38:33] <fritzwastaken> she plans and cooks 5 nights a week
[17:38:34] <JollyRgrs> i learned how to make really good pasta dishes by watching the dude at my old job as well
[17:38:36] <monr0e> JollyRgrs: Ew no. Stainless or nothing
[17:38:37] <vinrock> i thought about working at chiptle for a few months so i could learn burrito-fu
[17:38:44] <monr0e> And a good seasoned skillet
[17:38:44] <estranger> we threw out everything plastic... sigh
[17:38:50] <fritzwastaken> I was a cook in resturaunts for about 2.5 years
[17:38:59] <JollyRgrs> silicone is reeeeeeeally easy to clean
[17:39:04] <fritzwastaken> worked in a Uno's and a Macaroni Grill
[17:39:09] <vinrock> going camping with a buddy that was a cook somewhere is the best
[17:39:09] <fritzwastaken> and then in a small ale house
[17:39:12] <vinrock> breakfast always rules
[17:39:32] <JollyRgrs> vinrock: no need, just watch as they assemble
[17:39:49] <vinrock> its like making a sandwich for me
[17:39:49] <JollyRgrs> the key is a soft shell (steamed up a bit to be more plyable without breaking) and just not putting TOO much stuff in it
[17:39:50] <fritzwastaken> I justa te a  spinach egg pesto and havarti on an english muffin
[17:39:51] <monr0e> I hate silicone. Just soak for ten and don't scrub hard. Gentle with a scourer and you don't compress the weave, stuff comes right off
[17:39:54] <vinrock> no matter what the ones i make never taste as good
[17:39:56] <JollyRgrs> Moe's helped me with how to roll a fat one
[17:40:36] <JollyRgrs> vinrock: dude... i make a mean wrap
[17:41:18] <xe0n> i got some awesome flat bread in the freezer
[17:41:20] <vinrock> yeah for some reason sandwiches, subs, wraps, burritos, etc anything handheld i just dont seem to make them realy satisfying
[17:41:25] <xe0n> local supermarket cooks it in their bakery
[17:41:26] <xe0n> ++
[17:41:30] <vinrock> i like
[17:41:32] <JollyRgrs> get some buffalo chicken (deli sliced)... throw in sliced tomato, romaine, some pepper jack cheese. some bacon (if available) and just a little bit of ranch... sprinkle w/ cayenne and toss it on the griddle
[17:41:33] <vinrock> dont get the proportions right
[17:42:15] <xe0n> my breaky wrap go to is white flat bread, tomato, bacon, spinach, spring onion if its around, cheese, mixed herbs, touch of pepper
[17:42:39] <xe0n> pop into oven for 5
[17:42:43] <xe0n> let cheese melt
[17:42:45] <xe0n> mmm
[17:42:47] <xe0n> yum

[17:45:51] <JollyRgrs> if you can get it straight from the grinder (as in not mushed together)... you don't mix the beef, you basically roll it up lengthwise so the grains go lengthwise, then you chop it up like pre-made cookie dough... now you have the grains going up/down per patty and the burger will not be as tough... just gotta be careful because it can more easily fall apart when handling

[17:59:16] <SirSceptalot> @FeralTerminator: I'll admin that I've never tried to do a distance test without regenerative braking so far, but I will tell you that in a normal drive, 100% of my braking is done by regenrative braking.

[18:29:51] <Telgareith> PublicWiFi: I went and sat outside for half an hour last night
[18:29:54] <Telgareith> felt better
[18:30:03] <PattyCakes> oh sorry PublicWiFi, I forgot you had a question before my envy showed up
[18:30:05] <PattyCakes> https://github.com/Praqma/LearnKubernetes/blob/master/kamran/Kubernetes-The-Hard-Way-on-BareMetal.md
[18:30:20] <PublicWiFi> oh shit this is perfect 
[18:30:22] <PublicWiFi> ty
[18:30:25] <PublicWiFi> Telgareith: i was kidding.. mostly
[18:30:27] <PublicWiFi> :D
[18:30:29] <PublicWiFi> <3
[18:30:31] <Telgareith> no
[18:30:36] <PublicWiFi> oh okay
[18:30:36] <Telgareith> I know I need to get out more
[18:30:43] <Telgareith> but I'm afraid
[18:30:47] <PublicWiFi> oh what
[18:30:49] <PublicWiFi> of*
[18:30:55] <Telgareith> everything :(
[18:30:55] <PattyCakes> PublicWiFi this is the original K8s the Hard Way on Cloud - https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way
[18:31:17] <PublicWiFi> PattyCakes: thanks, Ill bookmark this too. gonna focus on on-prem since its easier and free lol
[18:31:26] <Telgareith> I enjoy car rides but in my current state I'm afraid I'd pull out in front of a big fast moving truck on purpose
[18:31:32] <PublicWiFi> jesus
[18:31:32] <PattyCakes> well the Kelsey guide might be a bit more up to date
[18:31:35] <PattyCakes> so you might need both
[18:31:44] <PublicWiFi> Telgareith: Do you exercise?
[18:31:52] <Telgareith> as much as I can
[18:31:56] <Telgareith> which isn't much
[18:31:59] <PublicWiFi> do you run?
[18:32:04] <Telgareith> LMAO
[18:32:06] <Telgareith> no
[18:32:07] <PublicWiFi> start the Couch to 5K app 
[18:32:11] <Telgareith> I can't run
[18:32:20] <PattyCakes> going out is over rated
[18:32:21] <PublicWiFi> I'm telling you, running + exercise will make you feel soooo much better after a while
[18:32:24] <Telgareith> for a list a dozen reasons long
[18:32:39] <vinrock> mind + body
[18:32:44] <PublicWiFi> like what?
[18:32:45] <vinrock> very important to have both working
[18:32:55] <Telgareith> top among them my left fibula is fucked, my ankle is fucked, and my foot is fucked
[18:33:10] <PattyCakes> ayyy, mine too
[18:33:12] <PattyCakes> only right side for me
[18:33:17] <PublicWiFi> got a gym nearby?
[18:33:31] <Telgareith> lesser is I just don't have the coordination TO run
[18:33:32] <Telgareith> yes
[18:33:32] <vinrock> start watching david goggins' videos
[18:33:32] <Fossil> Help my brain out here. I have a Linux server thats not mine with 2 NICs. One has routes pointing to a subnet, lets say 1.1.1.0/24 on eth1. But eth1 has no cable plugged in right now. Traffic from 1.1.1./0 is now coming in over eth0 from the router but I cant ping or http. Would the server try to throw the traffic out of eth1 still? Even if it's down?
[18:33:33] <PublicWiFi> ellipticals are REALLY easy on the joints
[18:33:34] <vinrock> get motivated
[18:33:36] <PattyCakes> ok, that's the first terrible advise from PublicWiFi 
[18:33:43] <PattyCakes> do not go sign up for a fucking gym package
[18:33:46] <PattyCakes> just start walking
[18:33:52] <vinrock> s/walking/twerking
[18:33:54] <layer8> PattyCakes meant: "just start twerking"
[18:33:56] <PattyCakes> no vinrock 
[18:33:58] <vinrock> yes
[18:34:00] <PublicWiFi> reason i said gym was for the ellipticals PattyCakes 
[18:34:00] <PattyCakes> NO
[18:34:01] <Telgareith> PattyCakes: I'm half a mile from the city rec center
[18:34:01] <vinrock> shake dat bootie
[18:34:06] <Telgareith> its like $100 a year
[18:34:11] <PublicWiFi> which are insanely east on your joints and you get good cardio unlike walking
[18:34:14] <PattyCakes> Telgareith, oh ok then
[18:34:40] <PublicWiFi> youll never hit higher heart rate zones by walking
[18:34:50] <PattyCakes> that's not the goal here for now
[18:34:54] <PattyCakes> the goal is to get him up and moving
[18:34:57] <Telgareith> yea
[18:35:09] <PattyCakes> no need to jump into cardio or heart rates today
[18:35:10] <PattyCakes> or tomorrow
[18:35:11] <PattyCakes> or next week
[18:35:16] <Telgareith> walking 100yards a a day would be a fantastic start
[18:35:20] <Telgareith> outside
[18:35:23] <PattyCakes> if nothing else, take a 10 minute walk per day. Eventually you might find you walk longer and further
[18:35:25] <Telgareith> *200
[18:35:26] * fritzwastaken grabs my popcorn to watch PublicWiFi rant about exercize
[18:35:48] <PublicWiFi> i think my gym costs like 20 bucks per month or something?
[18:35:48] <Telgareith> I've done this before
[18:35:52] <PublicWiFi> then you can lift too
[18:35:54] <PublicWiFi> -.-
[18:36:01] <mistiry> Fossil: what does your route tables say the traffic should be doing?
[18:36:01] <Telgareith> I have weights at rec center
[18:36:02] <vinrock> get a ymca membership
[18:36:04] <vinrock> then you can swim too
[18:36:04] <PublicWiFi> ^
[18:36:10] <vinrock> and join classes
[18:36:10] <PublicWiFi> oh nice
[18:36:19] <Telgareith> and in the summer I get access to the pool
[18:36:21] <vinrock> i been teling myself i want to start doing yoga
[18:36:25] <vinrock> ill eventually get around to it
[18:36:27] <vinrock> maybe
[18:36:27] <PublicWiFi> fuck yes 
[18:36:28] <Telgareith> pool is outdoor and closed in winter
[18:36:29] <PattyCakes> Guise you fuckers heard exercise and missed 99% of the issue
[18:36:30] <PublicWiFi> i wanna try yoga too
[18:36:46] <Fossil> mistiry Routes table says eth1 for those subnets I am coming from. So it makes sense ping doesnt work as traffic might return via an interface thats down. BUT http tcp should return in the same connection
[18:36:49] <PublicWiFi> i brought up exercise for teh sole reason of getting him in a better mental state
[18:36:57] <Telgareith> I'm in a really bad psych state
[18:37:01] <Telgareith> that needs to be addressed
[18:37:06] <PublicWiFi> but the whole point of it is working out your heart and muscles to get your body feeling better lol
[18:37:09] <PattyCakes> throwing Telgareith into a gym packed full of people is not the goal
[18:37:15] <PattyCakes> small steps
[18:37:16] <PattyCakes> literally
[18:37:37] <PublicWiFi> this is where I know I'm bad
[18:37:41] <Telgareith> I'm trying to get my family to commit to a self administered inpatient round
[18:37:47] <PublicWiFi> I'm a pretty motivated person and its hard for me to relate to someone who isn't
[18:37:49] <PublicWiFi> so sorry for that
[18:37:49] <fritzwastaken> we know ur bad too, thats why I got popcorn
[18:37:56] <fritzwastaken> ohhhh
[18:37:58] <PublicWiFi> it's something I've been trying to work on
[18:37:59] <fritzwastaken> thems fighting words
[18:38:03] <PublicWiFi> no they arent
[18:38:14] <PattyCakes> Sometimes you're a little much PublicWiFi 
[18:38:18] <PattyCakes> and that can scare people
[18:38:18] <PublicWiFi> oh well
[18:38:19] <fritzwastaken> right?
[18:38:25] <int0x1C8> biking is pretty good if you have a bike
[18:38:29] <PublicWiFi> yeah but man I was in his spot 
[18:38:33] <Telgareith> I'm encredibly lonely and have lost a lot of social habbits
[18:38:33] <fritzwastaken> "Well ti works for me, maybe you should be good like me"
[18:38:39] <PublicWiFi> and I finally just did it, I was scared and nervous and I didn' tknow a single person at the gym
[18:38:44] <PublicWiFi> but FUCK do I feel better now
[18:38:49] <PublicWiFi> so its hard not to preach the good word
[18:38:55] <mistiry> If the route table says to send all traffic for 1.1.1.0/24 to eth1, then that's what it will try to do. Do you have a default gateway? Just because traffic came IN on eth0 doesn't mean it will go OUT eth0 if you have routes screwing with things
[18:38:59] <Telgareith> the gym isn't the problem
[18:39:08] <Telgareith> getting the energy to GO to the gym is
[18:39:29] <vinrock> IDLE HANDS ARE THE DEVIL'S PLAYGROUND
[18:39:36] <vinrock> you ever think about building models or some shit
[18:39:47] <vinrock> something to just kep you mind occupied and possibly open doors
[18:39:56] <PublicWiFi> or just fap like i do
[18:39:59] <PublicWiFi> a lot
[18:40:02] <Telgareith> hopefully now that I'm unemployed I can start working on myself without "you're fired" looming over my head
[18:40:05] <PublicWiFi> like, constantly
[18:40:15] <PublicWiFi> oh SNAP
[18:40:23] <PublicWiFi> talk about a good "hobby"
[18:40:30] <PublicWiFi> small business is DOPE
[18:41:17] <Fossil> mistiry It's not my machine, but the default GW is set correctly on that one. Pointing to the correct IP on eth0. I would say normal TCP traffic should reply in the same connection/session thus the same interface. I dunno, I cant think anymore. Hard because I cant login to the box
[18:41:26] <PublicWiFi> I just wanna see my friends succeed ;_;
[18:41:27] <Telgareith> my hobbies right now are learning k8s, ansible, more AzureDevOps, Jenkins, getting better at managing git repos
[18:41:41] <PublicWiFi> oh now you're crushing it

[18:42:01] <fritzwastaken> I tried getting into that one
[18:42:15] <fritzwastaken> very Dont starveish
[18:42:15] <PattyCakes> Telgareith Ansible won't be very helpful for the path you're on
[18:42:19] <PattyCakes> good knowledge to have sure
[18:42:22] <PattyCakes> but not necessarily useful
[18:42:36] <mistiry> Fossil: Yes, TCP is stateful, but if the network stack on the system doesnt know how to route the traffic to send the response, it's not going to work.
[18:42:53] <Fossil> Yeah so thats the issue then. I will contact the other party and have them sort it
[18:42:56] <Fossil> Cheers
[18:43:02] <PattyCakes> I'd slide out Ansible for Terraform Telgareith 
[18:43:05] <mistiry> As I metioned, just because it came IN on eth0 does not mean it will go out eth0. There's some routing issues going on. 
[18:43:07] <mistiry> np
[18:43:15] <Telgareith> PattyCakes: I'm most likely not going to be doing green field deployments, so there will be lift and shift along with on prem, so I need to know it
[18:43:16] <mistiry> Ansible and Terraform solve differnet things

[18:52:41] <Telgareith> there's also the time my then present boss and the two sysadmins spent 8hrs arguing over why I was wrong while prod was down, when I could them I could have it permanently fixed in 2hrs
[18:52:47] <PattyCakes> :)
[18:53:05] <Telgareith> then the other developer that knows ANYTHING about that system
[18:53:22] <Telgareith> came in and deleted the problematic file like 8 times before it unstuck itself
[18:53:37] <Telgareith> guess what, next week. Same shit
[18:53:57] <Telgareith> It was a 4 line change!
[18:53:59] <PublicWiFi> PattyCakes: what's the different between k8s 1.23 and 1.3?
[18:54:22] <Telgareith> the 2hrs was putting it through CA and then deploying to prod
[18:54:31] <Telgareith> and the dev
[18:54:35] <PublicWiFi> this guide uses 1.3 which came out a while ago but when I look a ttheir releases they show 1.23 as teh latest, so i assume its a different set of features?

[19:37:39] <Hunterkll> my best work meeting moment was when someone during a mass all hands call had to say "Uhm, whoever's, uhm, moaning, could you please go on mute?"
[19:37:41] <lancehead> Hunterkll, I wish work meetings didn't exist

[19:40:56] <monr0e> NTSYSTEM no. to clarify, modemst1 is a configuration file that sits in a call-stack for "devices" (read: components of the phone), and contains parameters for adjusting the radio to match network types, locale, as well as authentication. It's usually in /dev/block/by-name or somewhere similar. However, that path is usually a symlink to the rom on the radio that is mounted at boot. 
[19:40:58] <lancehead> mine was someone from my college joining a lecture, shirtless, in bed, while smoking a blunt 
[19:41:06] <thegodsquirrel> I saw a guy have his wife walk through the background naked to the bathroom

[19:42:18] <DrGibbysWifi> hmmm
[19:42:20] <DrGibbysWifi> its raining
[19:42:20] <monr0e> NTSYSTEM furthermore, if you wipe modemst1, you're wiping the rom on the radio SoC itself - usually. That means you're not only wiping the IMEI and identity information, you're wiping the information that tells the system how to access, authenticate with, and communicate on the mobile network
[19:42:20] <Hunterkll> tbh thoug
[19:42:22] <DrGibbysWifi> hard
[19:42:22] <vinrock> there was a politician in brazil doing a zoom
[19:42:25] <Hunterkll> we just don't erally beleive in video calls anyway
[19:42:31] <Hunterkll> sure it was a fad during the beginning of 2020 but eh

[20:10:29] <monr0e> joking aside, the only thing you can do with the IMEI is change it live - those changes don't persist. Technically you can edit the file in a good ehex editor, but if the rom fails an integrity check, you're back to square one.

[22:14:06] <NTSYSTEM> Why do you love it?
[22:14:12] <NTSYSTEM> It's grossly overpriced for a domestic product.
[22:14:18] <vinrock> i thought it was cheap
[22:14:33] <NTSYSTEM> I use it as an accessory for data only, but compared to T-mobile plans and T-mobile international data plans, it's really expensive. 
[22:14:34] <Hunterkll> turn it off when i'm not using it, expanded coverage when i'm traveling as an emergency backup phone, and if i were using it as my primary phone it'd cost about the same as my line does monthly when i max out data 
[22:14:53] <Hunterkll> $70/mo + addons vs about $70/mo it's really on par for t-mo's pricing
[22:14:57] <NTSYSTEM> $70 + local state taxes (so you say you're in Nevada to have chapest)

[22:15:10] <NTSYSTEM> T-mobile pricing is as low as $35/line for unlimited data and usa calling and roaming at 3g.
[22:15:13] <Hunterkll> my bill would be the same per line or cheaper with fi 
[22:15:16] <Hunterkll> yea... no
[22:15:21] <Hunterkll> more like $70/line for a sane plan
[22:15:28] <Hunterkll> which would match fi's

[22:15:47] <Hunterkll> before they introduced the cap on data charges I might have agreed with you 
[22:15:54] <vinrock> uh im pretty sure vzw business plus 1.0 im only paying $40/device/mo for 'unlimited data' and 5g
[22:16:02] <NTSYSTEM> No support agent through google, t-mobile free 611 calling anywhere in the world. 
[22:16:02] <vinrock> and $45/mo for pro
[22:16:12] <vinrock> that dont sound so cheap for tmobile

[22:16:28] <NTSYSTEM> Google has 0 support, and it may disapear at anytime like most google products.
[22:16:37] <NTSYSTEM> But T-mobile also includes local carrier taxes, Fi does not. 
[22:16:48] <NTSYSTEM> So that an be $4-20 depending where you are.

[22:19:30] <NTSYSTEM> Hunterkll I just don't like the new 3 month stateside requirement
[22:19:42] <NTSYSTEM> it isn't 90 days, it's per biling period 
[22:20:01] <bomb> everyone and his dog needs a mobile app these days.
[22:20:03] <NTSYSTEM> honetly easier to just run a vpn on your phone and then use a local sim and force it to drop if it breaks 
[22:20:19] <Hunterkll> yea here was the 2015 kit

[22:20:46] <Hunterkll> cute little charging dock for the nexus 
[22:21:04] <NTSYSTEM> I remember they went virtual for a year and you went to a website and got discounts and promos
[22:21:10] <NTSYSTEM> maybe 2018?
[22:21:29] <Hunterkll> ah it was some kinda welcome kit
[22:21:32] <Hunterkll> earbuds, battery bank, and case
[22:22:09] <Hunterkll> speaking of, I need to find that data-only SIM i got from them and put it to use 
[22:22:23] <NTSYSTEM> the sim cards expire FYI
[22:22:27] <Hunterkll> and replace the battery in my nexus 6, had the new one here for like 3 months
[22:22:30] <Hunterkll> yes, i'm aware
[22:22:34] <Hunterkll> i just got a replacement like last month
[22:22:35] <NTSYSTEM> that's so silly imo
[22:22:35] <Hunterkll> lol
[22:22:44] <Hunterkll> nah, that's kind of a semi-thing with every carrier
[22:22:48] <Hunterkll> private key management reasons
[22:22:57] <Hunterkll> and technology gap / changes
[22:23:13] <Hunterkll> a lot of the old unused t-mo simcards i have aren't able to be used on the newer devices/network without degredation of service, if they'll even register at all
[22:23:21] <Hunterkll> same with AT&T kits i have

[22:31:04] <signofzeta> I had a customer get a phishing domain registered against them. Let's say they're contoso.com.  Someone registered contoso.se.  The Swedish Internet Authority changed the nameservers, updated WHOIS, *and* even broke DNSSEC delegation to the fake domain.  Impressive!
[22:31:31] <Hunterkll> NTSYSTEM: I fortuantely have an MVNO that still lets me use 2G/GSM networks that are still in place, so I don't need to yet, but eventually i'm gonna make a little backpack unit that has my own "network" to keep using my RAZR phones as convention backup phones and translates it to either VOIP or to my regular cellular :X
[22:31:37] <Hunterkll> those things last the entire convention on a single charge 
[22:31:40] <Hunterkll> great backup phone
[22:32:07] <NTSYSTEM> I was able to use my amazon whispernet card for the longest time
[22:32:19] <NTSYSTEM> you could remove them from the first gen kindles
[22:32:20] <signofzeta> Hunterkll, NTSYSTEM: less stuff in the e-waste pile!  Let's just hope cell phones continue to support 2G/3G despite their shutdown.
[22:32:29] <NTSYSTEM> they won't actually signofzeta 
[22:32:35] <signofzeta> oh
[22:32:39] <bomb> should I read potato chips or more brownies?
[22:32:42] <NTSYSTEM> having 2g, 3g, 4g and 5g modems is expensive for manfucaturing cost and battery reasons
[22:32:49] <signofzeta> [bartsimpson_atleastyoutried.jpg]
[22:32:49] <Hunterkll> it's all in one chip.....
[22:32:54] <NTSYSTEM> Hunterkll yes and no
[22:32:57] <Hunterkll> and it will be, especially for international support
[22:33:10] <Hunterkll> just like how my 3/3.5G phone only supports 2G in the US :D
[22:33:10] <NTSYSTEM> turning off thr 5g feature for example will boost iphones and most androids with an hour or two in battery life
[22:33:21] <NTSYSTEM> Hunterkll that's more bands vs protocol itself
[22:33:28] <Hunterkll> actually in this case it's protocol
[22:33:40] <Hunterkll> it's a FOMA phone 
[22:33:50] <NTSYSTEM> man :< laxatives suck 
[22:33:56] <Hunterkll> also has a built in 1seg tuner with antenna
[22:33:58] <Hunterkll> pretty neat thing
[22:34:05] <Hunterkll> Sharp SH-06D
[22:34:08] <vinrock> they can be fun if you're into that kind of thing
[22:34:08] <NTSYSTEM> I like the xiaomi phones for the tuners
[22:34:14] <NTSYSTEM> but sharp is fun for japanese phones in generall
[22:34:20] <Hunterkll> Sadly the TV tuner only works in japan, obviously 
[22:34:40] <Hunterkll> I have the NERV edition, have had it for a stupid long time
[22:34:45] <Hunterkll> SIM probably still has money on it too
[22:34:55] <bomb> you can replace the tuner rather easily
[22:35:02] <Hunterkll> .... no?

[22:35:54] <Hunterkll> it's also waterproof
[22:36:08] <Hunterkll> which i used to have great fun with dropping it in a cup of water at bars to show off before more and more phones started being like that
[22:36:08] <bomb> looks badass, but a bit old?
[22:36:15] <Hunterkll> was great seeing people's expression in 2013 when i did that in america
[22:36:36] <Hunterkll> well, they only made 10,000 of the NERV edition 
[22:36:36] <Hunterkll> but yea
[22:36:40] <Hunterkll> the last update was to android 4 
[22:36:44] <Hunterkll> still gets occasional app updates too though
[22:36:45] <NTSYSTEM> Hunterkll you have one of 10,000
[22:36:56] <NTSYSTEM> but wow android 2.3 that still works
[22:37:02] <NTSYSTEM> you can probably try to custom rom it to a newer version
[22:37:06] <Hunterkll> .....
[22:37:12] <Hunterkll> you have the reading comprehension of a goldfish
[22:37:23] <bomb> yeah I used an old 2.3 for a few months when I lost my phone
[22:37:45] <bomb> it's dumb, hardware is fine, but software makes it obsolete
[22:37:47] <Hunterkll> but no, i'd have to do a fuckload of work to kick my old android build system back into gear and produce something for this 
[22:38:04] <Hunterkll> because half the damn point of it is the 3D display and the NERV interface that came with it special

[23:11:22] <PublicWiFi> even changing the oil is a bitch cause there's no clearance for leverage. I have to use a fuckin breaker bar

[23:13:29] <PattyCakes> the reel was the best decision ever
[23:13:31] <Hunterkll>  we got a 60 gal compressor in the basement with outside hookups ran out near where the cables go in and dryer exhaust is
[23:13:33] <PattyCakes> I use my compressor all the time now
[23:13:46] <PattyCakes> yea Hunterkll, when I build the backyard garage I'll upgrade to a 60
[23:13:52] <PattyCakes> but I wanted something with wheels for now
[23:14:16] <PublicWiFi> that would be insane
[23:14:33] <PublicWiFi> also I've been looking at buying, or building, a 240v pressure washer for the house
[23:14:57] <PublicWiFi> i love man shit
[23:14:59] <PublicWiFi> xD
[23:15:07] <vinrock> you can get a decent heated pressure washer off alibaba for cheap
[23:15:10] <PattyCakes> garage is an absolute MESS at the moment, but the compressor lives between the two garage doors - https://put.gd/1648665882/Screen-Shot-2022-03-30-13-44-34.94.png

[23:22:24] <vinrock> man i had a brand-new Matco Custom 6s toolbox that i sold for a grand when i was a broke kid
[23:22:27] * PattyCakes shrutgs
[23:22:28] <Hunterkll> also estate auctions too
[23:22:36] <vinrock> the build sheet on it was like $8k
[23:22:37] <PattyCakes> I have the big craftsman box
[23:22:40] <PattyCakes> the 3000 series one
[23:22:41] <Hunterkll> i got a lot of heavy duty ass hand tools for cheap at an estate auction
[23:22:41] <vinrock> fell off the back of a truck
[23:22:45] <Hunterkll> hand drill as big as my fuckin arm
[23:22:45] <Hunterkll> lol
[23:22:52] <vinrock> nice
[23:24:24] <PattyCakes> also, the cheap harbor freight might be junk, but don't discount some of the shit they sell
[23:24:30] <PattyCakes> their icon ratchets and sockets?
[23:24:33] <PattyCakes> bomb fucking bomb
[23:25:10] <PattyCakes> it's 95% the quality of Snap-On, with a easy replacement warranty, and half the price
[23:25:14] <vinrock> hard sell
[23:25:18] <vinrock> ive split countless sockets
[23:25:26] <PattyCakes> of the icon brand?
[23:25:30] <vinrock> not from them per se but off brand and craftsman stuff
[23:25:47] <sd> 14<P​horcys> im fucking pissed
[23:26:00] <vinrock> only shit ive never split was matco/snap-on and the other brand i cant remmeber
[23:26:02] <PattyCakes> well like I said, you gotta know what you're buying at harbor freight. They don't JUST sell cheap
[23:26:31] <vinrock> im pretty sure AvE discovered that harbon freight sells an airgun thats the exact same thing as the IR airgun
[23:26:39] <PattyCakes> yup

[23:28:39] <PattyCakes> the only reason I'd buy a honda vs HF for a small generator is parts
[23:28:46] <PattyCakes> finding honda parts will be 10x easier than HF parts
[23:28:53] <PattyCakes> that might or might not exist at the time I need them
[23:29:45] <PattyCakes> oh also harbor freight nail guns
[23:29:58] <PattyCakes> wouldn't use them for building an entire house, but they do what I need just fine

[23:31:14] <PattyCakes> Hunterkll dad's got an old cummins generator in the back of the farm truck. I'm not sure what has more hours on it
