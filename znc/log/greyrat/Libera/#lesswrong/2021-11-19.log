[04:14:49] <quanticle> Well, as the article alluded to, for a while it seemed like that was changing.
[04:14:51] <adiabatic> to be fair, the microchips are mind-blowingly good
[04:15:19] <quanticle> And that Taiwan would match the pivot with a more level-headed rational defensive posture

The general tone is of trying to describe, and evaluate, a phenomenon which has passed and will never recur. To sum up Ellman's judgment: socialist planning was an attempt at modernization from above, driven by
[04:41:31] <feepbot> the imperative of being militarily competitive with industrialized European powers. In that goal, it succeeded, at least up through the 1950s.

[05:47:02] <gwern> ...is that how raspberries work? I feel like I'd've read about using raspberries for 'organic natural dyes' if raspberry pigments were remotely stable
[05:47:29] <rmmh> it's more that they're not colorfast 
[05:47:50] <gwern> 'Besides "looking amazing," she wants her wedding to "feed the local animals" (our venue is in the woods). Yes, we have confirmed that the "local animals" eat raspberries.

[05:50:08] <rmmh> yeah 
[05:50:14] <gwern> and those are presumably freshly dyed, as bright as they'll ever be, and just fade from there

[07:47:15] <gwern> oh, I think that looks nice
[07:47:26] <gwern> so I guess I will go ahead and add that lil' bit o' css
[07:48:02] <quanticle> And that first screenshot was actually from Chrome. My mistake. That's why it has functional sidenotes, but no hanging-quotes 
[07:48:26] <quanticle> So... yeah, sidenotes just don't show up in Safari 15.0 gg
[07:50:30] <gwern> I'll have to leave that to Obormot\Arcturus. I can't even guess what could be going wrong if there are no console rrors but the sidenotes just aren't appearing.
[07:53:15] <quanticle> Yeah, the screen width is 1792, which... should be wide enough?
[07:53:43] <gwern> I assume so, that's pretty wide, I think
[07:56:18] <quanticle> What is this GWLog function, and how do I get it to print log messages to the console?
[07:58:25] <quanticle> Ah, got it: have to set gw-log-level in localstorage
[07:59:34] * gwern pushes the hanging-punctuation. this rabbithole started because he was checking his little writeup of Knuth-Plass for /Design#abandoned, noticed a link was missing all the needful WP links about microtypography and kerning etc, saw WP mention Medium implementing an esoteric feature, thought to himself "yeah but I bet it's broken because medium is shit" and things escalating from there
[08:00:29] <quanticle> And now you have quanticle setting strange flags in Safari 15.0 and attempting to decipher the entrails that sidenotes.js is leaving all over his console
[08:01:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> There's a call to set it, one sec

[10:04:08] <PlanckWalk> That's how I'm using ... hmm, 11 GB
[10:04:17] <adiabatic> 1 is my stuff, 2 is (work) Slack and mail, 3 is what I'm working on usually, 4–8 are three different work shits (sometimes a work shit will be better spread across 2–3 desktops)…
[10:05:21] <adiabatic> and on my SECOND monitor, the lowest number is always blank (the previous version of macOS shipped with a VERY fantastic picture of Catalina), the next desktop is a couple of Terminal windows and is like a home base, and everything beyond that are various work shits

[10:08:31] <nshepperd2> running the wired on only 7.57GB, how efficient
[10:08:51] <adiabatic> I have to organize my shit or else my puny little brain gets overwhelmed. I use Exposé a _lot_, so if I have a gazillion windows on the same desktop I can't find what I'm looking for
[10:10:59] <adiabatic> also Chrome is my work browser and I have thirty-seven different profiles in it
[10:11:06] <quanticle> Ohhhh... you use expose
[10:11:20] <adiabatic> best use of mouse4/mouse5 ever made
[10:13:12] <quanticle> Yeah, my only complaint with witch is that it uses the accessibility API to determine what is and isn't a window, so sometimes it picks up things and thinks they're windows even when they're not.
[10:13:20] <quanticle> Like the "Find" dialog in Chrome
[10:14:16] <quanticle> I'm guessing that has to do with how MacOS enumerates selectable elements for actual accesbility programs, rather than alt-tab window switchers
[10:17:18] <adiabatic> I've seen divvy in action but never got into autotilers. basically the right size for any one window is almost never a fraction of what a screen will give you
[10:20:56] <quanticle> Well, I paid for divvy a while ago, but I think today I'd use something like rectangle. The way I have it set up is Ctrl-Option left, right, up, down, do halves, and Ctrl-Option u, i, j, k do quarters
[10:21:38] <quanticle> Left-right splits are always useful, and top-bottom splits are useful for webdev
[10:22:00] <quanticle> Where you can sacrifice vertical space, but you don't want your content reflowing because you made the window super-narrow
[10:27:21] <PapuaHardyNet> 37 different profiles?

[10:32:48] <feep[work]> well, sometimes I want to screenshare, and uh, yeah

[10:34:24] <PlanckWalk> On mine, one of the switch desktop triggers is scrolling the mousewheel over the workspace switcher widget.

[21:04:22] <feep> okay, so you can handle lots of things with insurance, right? health insurance, work ability insurance, life insurance

[21:05:31] <kuudes> in what currency

[22:31:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> Amazing
[22:31:40] <ggreer> in the livestream he broke down crying as the verdict was being read and he realized he would go free
[22:32:17] <PapuaHardyNet> he would go free? whoa
[22:32:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's what being acquitted means, yes :p
[22:32:48] <PapuaHardyNet> it didn't sink in until you put it in simpler words hahahah
