[01:25:17] <h4k1m0u> Hi, a question came to my mind regarding inheritance. When a derived class inherits from a derived class, does the derived class end up with a copy of the field members (not talking about methods) of the base class (those that are protected/public ofc)?
[01:27:02] <Oxyd> Yes, of course. If you have struct base { int member; }; struct d1 : base { }; struct d2 : d1 { };, then d2 contains d1 as a subobject, and d1 contains base as a subobject, so in this way d2 also contains base.

[01:46:54] <Oxyd> You can imagine that struct d1 : base { }; becomes struct d1 { base __base; }; and struct d2 : d1 { }; becomes struct d2 { d1 __d1; };. So if you add d2::f() { member = 2; }, it gets rewritten to __d1.__base.member = 2;. In reality, the bases don't have any name you can access yourself, though.

[03:04:51] <Guest54> is there a decent readable way to figure out if two doubles are approximately equal based on a precision? Looking at this answer https://stackoverflow.com/a/253874 but it seems so unreadable
[03:07:37] <danieldg> Guest54: it's easier if you have an actual value for "within x" and not just "within some multiple of the floating point precision"
[03:08:16] <Alipha> just copy approximatelyEqual and be done with it ;-) (though change float to double?)
[03:08:55] <danieldg> what more do you want, really?
[03:09:14] <danieldg> if you want "within 0.000001" then write it that way :)
[03:09:53] <danieldg> that's normally what you actually want unless you're writing floating point test functions
[03:10:41] <Guest54> hmm fair enough, I should give more context :)
[03:11:13] <Alipha> indeed, it could be simply `return fabs(a - b) <= epsilon;` if you know what scale of numbers you're comparing
[03:11:42] <danieldg> if you don't know the scale, you're likely to have unknown rounding errors *anyway*
[03:11:42] <Guest54> so we use a 3rd party api that, sometimes instead of gives the value 0, gives us weird values like -8.668312521342e-22
[03:12:08] *** Quits: qwedfg (~qwedfg@user/qwedfg) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[03:12:23] <danieldg> sure, that's pretty common
[03:12:31] <Alipha> what are the other values (which are supposed to be non-zero) like?
[03:12:36] <Guest54> if the user specify a lower bound of 0, and the value from the api is that weird thing^, then the check is not going to pass (when really i should)
[03:13:03] <Alipha> 5.3? 498129.1? 0.0034? 9.1e15?
[03:13:19] <Alipha> comparing against zero is especially difficult
[03:13:29] <Guest54> this is more weird edge case so far, there could be more, but I'm just looking for a sensisble impl that will work for most cases
[03:13:54] <Alipha> because you have to use the scale of the numbers that were used to produce what was supposed to have a value of 0

[03:14:27] <danieldg> (the one in SO)
[03:15:05] <Guest54> I'm wondering if there is any concept of a "relative epsilon"
[03:15:09] <danieldg> just define things as 'within x' where x is a useful error bound
[03:15:42] <danieldg> sure: take expected_output * DOUBLE_EPSILON (or whatever that constant is named)
[03:15:43] <Guest54> yep but the x depends on the values we're comparing right? I'm not sure if it's a value that can work for *all* cases
[03:16:24] *** Joins: qwedfg (~qwedfg@user/qwedfg)
[03:16:26] <Guest54> for eg, if we're comparing 2 digits numbers, then maybe it makes for epilson to be 0.001. So 99 vs 99.001 are approximately equal.
[03:16:28] <Alipha> Guest54: that approximatelyEqual uses a "relative epsilon". but again, that function doesn't work if you pass in 0 for a or b
[03:16:56] *** Quits: AmR (~AmREiSa@156.207.152.245) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[03:17:06] <Guest54> but if we're comparing values like 0.00005 and  0.00006, then that epislon is going to work.
[03:17:09] <danieldg> Guest54: that's why you need a nonzero "expected" value to use
[03:17:10] <Guest54> not*
[03:17:52] <danieldg> if you're measuring distances walked in light-years, your negative number is kinda significant
[03:18:02] <danieldg> (maybe. I didn't do math)
[03:19:01] <Guest54> I'm reading this article https://randomascii.wordpress.com/2012/02/25/comparing-floating-point-numbers-2012-edition/
[03:19:05] <Guest54> the part about relative epsilons
[03:19:42] <danieldg> there isn't a generic solution to this
[03:20:02] <danieldg> it's much better to know your domain and expected error size

[03:20:50] <Alipha> Guest54: https://godbolt.org/z/4nYsen19r ... which again, it sounds like you want to compare against 0, which won't work with approximatelyEqual

[03:22:33] <Guest54> Alipha but it makes sense though, right? I wouldn't `0.00005` to be equal to `0.00006`, with epsilon being tiny
[03:22:40] <Guest54> wouldn't expect&
[03:22:56] <danieldg> Guest54: I would want those to be equal in some cases
[03:24:23] <Alipha> Guest54: right. i was illustrating that this approximatelyEqual uses a "relative epsilon" and does indeed treat 99 == 99.001 and 0.00005 != 0.00006 as desired
[03:24:52] <Guest54> hmm. Basically, I know I should probably maybe look more into my use case values ...but I feel like the problem is general enough. I want to compare two doubles, with a relatively "tiny" epsilon that dynamic changes based on the magnitude of the datapoints
[03:25:05] <Guest54> dynamically*
[03:25:20] <danieldg> Guest54: then you need a magnitude on your zero
[03:25:51] <danieldg> Guest54: 0.0±0.1 or 0.0±1e-10
[03:26:21] <danieldg> just like 0 has a sign, in this case zero needs a magnitude
[03:26:25] <Guest54> hmm
[03:27:09] <danieldg> sadly the spec writers for floating point didn't define that :)
[03:27:25] <danieldg> (I think signed zero causes enough confusion already)
[03:27:26] <Guest54> `approximatelyEqual(0.00005, -8.668312521342e-22, 0.0001)` fails which I guess makes sense

[03:28:46] <Alipha> Guest54: so how small of a number should be equal to 0 then? apparently for this example, 0.00005 is supposed to be equal to 0
[03:30:42] <Alipha> for `approximatelyEqual(0.00005, x, 0.0001)`, only values of x between 0.000049999 and 0.000050001 will be considered equal to 0.00005
[03:30:47] <Guest54> yep let's say that anything with a prefix like 0.00<some numbers> is equal to 0
[03:31:19] <Alipha> `return fabs(a - b) < 0.01;`
[03:32:30] <Guest54> Alipha hmm I see so that would be a separate condition to the function, right?
[03:32:59] <danieldg> that would be instead of the function
[03:33:00] <Alipha> Guest54: no, it would be the function entirely
[03:33:10] <Guest54> as in, if `a` and `b` have a "0.", prefix use fabs(a-b) < 0.01

[03:38:28] <danieldg> a floating point-with-error tuple wrapper is a good abstraction

[03:39:47] <Alipha> so multiplying and dividing would adjust the error magnitude while adding and subtracting wouldn't?

[03:43:40] <danieldg> for scientific calculations a better formula may be needed that combines them like you combine sigmas on normal distributions
[03:44:44] <Guest54> Alipha I'm playing around with that simple fabs implementation https://godbolt.org/z/n3Yh6aYec It fails on `0.00005, 0.00006`, which is not ideal. Basically I want the epsilon to scale down when I'm comparing tiny values.  setting to 0.01 is fine for saying, eg 99 and 99.01 are "equal", or 0 and 0.01 are equal. But if the values I'd like the
[03:44:44] <Guest54> epsilon to be scaled appropriately. I hope i'm making sense:)

[10:03:09] <xisop> if i use this on a forward_list, does the copy constructor ever get called ? for(const auto& a : my_forward_list){
[10:03:13] <Gamah> I have a static member in a namespace and want to update it later like namespace::member = 5; why doesn't this seem to work?
[10:03:27] <Gamah> i read about extern but then i have undefined references everywhere...
[10:03:41] *** Quits: Ex0 (~Ex0@2001:448a:1082:fe6f:90ff:79c9:2991:2a5) (K-Lined)
[10:03:45] <xisop> Gamah: something can't be static and extern at the same time
[10:04:20] <Gamah> yes i replaced static with extern
[10:04:31] <Gamah> static compiles and runs, but the new value that's assigned doesn't seem to stick?
[10:04:41] <Gamah> extern doesn't compile because undefined
[10:05:12] <xisop> I mean, you could probably define a static reference function (not sure im using the correct term though)
[10:05:42] <xisop> static inline int& member(){ static int m; return m; }
[10:05:51] <Gamah> oh..
[10:05:52] <xisop> then you'd just call the function to access the static value...
[10:06:10] <xisop> it's a sort of singleton pattern, though it might be an anti-pattern if you ask other people
[10:06:21] <Gamah> i guess maybe it just doesn't need to be static... a member of a namespace is "global" to that namespace right?
[10:06:40] <xisop> it should be, yeah
[10:08:09] <Gamah> now i just get multiple definition errors everywhere it's referenced.
[10:08:57] <xisop> is it in a header file or a source file?
[10:09:17] <Gamah> definition in the header, then referenced in many source files
[10:09:21] <xisop> if you include a header in a couple places and define a member variable as non-extern, you'll get that
[10:09:32] <Gamah> the header is pragma once
[10:09:40] <xisop> and it's defined as extern?
[10:09:53] <Gamah> no, i thought it could just be a plain member? i'll try extern
[10:10:34] <xisop> it might make more sense to encapsulate some of this logic into a struct/class.. then just have one instance of that class
[10:10:55] <Gamah> now it's only complaining of undefined references where i'm trying to assign them...
[10:11:02] <Gamah> this feels closer
[10:11:33] <Gamah> struct is probably correct, i like the syntax of config::threads tho vs config.threads, i can be academically explained away from the preference tho
[10:12:27] <xisop> have you seen the cppfaq?
[10:12:46] <xisop> https://isocpp.org/faq
[10:13:21] <xisop> That has been a gold mine over the years... as far back as I can remember, people were constantly pointing me that way. i also saw the member function idea from there (iirc)
[10:13:43] <Gamah> yeah aka "getters and setters" in every lang ever
[10:14:05] <Gamah> but it's not a value that needs to be set more than once ever....
[10:14:10] <xisop> The issue with declaring something extern is that you no longer have control over who uses it or what happens to it
[10:15:07] <xisop> i cringe at getters and setters.. i usually avoid them and instead write methods that perform the logic i want.. or subsets of the logic i want
[10:15:55] <Gamah> i really just want a kind of global space where i can hold config values like number of threads to spawn, how many iterations to do, etc.... read from json file at runtime so it's not hard complied into the binary
[10:16:21] <xisop> sounds like a struct config to me ;)
[10:17:13] <xisop> you could even specify every member as const and set the values using an initializer_list constructor
[10:17:15] <Gamah> ugh that's so much code to refactor...
[10:18:02] <xisop> well, keep in mind, i'm speaking about this as if i had the choice to. your codebase imposes limitations that i'm not aware of, so i understand if it cant be used

[10:46:18] <ville> !give Gamah -Wall
[10:46:19] <nolyc> Gamah: -Wall is is only -Wsome; it leaves out many warnings. To really get a lot of warnings, you should use '-Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -Wconversion -std=c++17 -O2'
[10:48:07] <Alipha> !inline
[10:48:08] <nolyc> The inline specifier was historically intended to be a code inlining hint. However, it has a semantic effect; functions marked inline can be defined in every TU in which they are used (as long as the definitions are identical), making headers the appropriate place to define them if they are used in multiple TUs
[10:48:22] <Alipha> !tu
[10:48:23] <nolyc> A source file together with all included headers and included source files, less any source lines skipped by preprocessor conditionals, is called a translation unit, or TU. TUs can be separately translated and then later linked to produce an executable program.
[10:48:58] <Gamah> translation unit.... so that's what i need to read up on

[11:11:08] <Alipha> Gamah: #include is literally just a copy and paste. If you define (ie, create) `int member;` in foo.h and you #include foo.h in both foo.cpp and bar.cpp, then `int member;` will get created in both foo.cpp and bar.cpp, hence the multiple definitions linker error. #pragma once does not help this. The compiler compiles cpp files completely separately--when the compiler compiles bar.cpp, it has no memory of
[11:11:10] <Alipha> anything that happened when it compiled foo.cpp or vice versa. What #pragma once is for is if you try to include the same header twice when during the compilation of one TU. eg, if foo.cpp includes foo.h and quux.h, and quux.h also includes foo.h. And so, you want to put `extern int member;` in foo.h so that foo.cpp and bar.cpp can both include foo.h to find out that member exists and what type it is.

[11:59:17] <Alipha> In the definition, anyway
[11:59:23] <fluter> Alipha: our style guide says we must have parameter name no matter what :S
[11:59:45] <fluter> there is a checker in ci

[16:01:39] <Guest54> hey guys I'm trying to compare two doubles with a relative epsilon approach described here https://randomascii.wordpress.com/2012/02/25/comparing-floating-point-numbers-2012-edition/
[16:01:56] <Guest54> I have this implementation https://godbolt.org/z/ffEjn7M47 with test cases
[16:02:05] <Guest54> but it fails on points near 0
[16:02:21] <Guest54> can someone point me how to fix this?

[16:25:52] <CarloWood> I don't like it. In line 12 you interpret as epsilon having the same unit as a and b, and in line 21 it unitless.

[16:26:18] <CarloWood> It therefore is the code of someone who doesn't know what they want (or what they are doing).
[16:26:45] <CarloWood> Or, at the very least - a good comment that f*ing explains what is going on and why is missing.
[16:28:19] <Guest54> CarloWood what do you mean "unitless"
[16:28:29] <CarloWood> Perhaps both are needed, an abs_relative_error and an epsilon.
[16:29:25] <CarloWood> If a and b are in meters, then diff is in meters too (a-b), and so is largest. Therefore on line 21 you compare meters with meters times epsilon.
[16:29:51] <CarloWood> Hence epsilon there has to be unitless. If it was in meters, like on line 12, you'd be comparing meters with square meters.
[16:31:42] <CarloWood> I think my function also doesn't work well near zero anyway... That is, not when the absolute value of the inputs have the amplitude of the typical float/double round-off error.

[16:32:38] <Guest54> hmm I still don't understand, sorry. Can you point me to a case where my function would fail?
[16:33:29] <CarloWood> Lets say the accuracy of the computer is 32 bits (whatever) for the mantissa, ok?
[16:33:38] *** Joins: lxsameer (~lxsameer@user/lxsameer)
[16:34:29] <CarloWood> Then 0.00000000009 = 9.000000 * 10E-11  ... with high precision, in theory.
[16:35:02] <CarloWood> The computer CAN see the difference between 9.000000 * 10E-11 and 9.010000 * 10E-11  easily.

[16:35:49] *** Quits: lionkor (~lionkor@beammp/staff/lionkor) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[16:35:55] <Guest54> ok, but in my case I'd like 0.00000000009 == 0.0
[16:35:55] <CarloWood> But, if this 0.00000000009 is the result of a round off error where you subtracted two large numbers...
[16:36:03] *** gentooclimax is now known as climax
[16:36:26] <CarloWood> Then you need an epsilon that is interpreted as an absolute _value_ (the same unit as x and y).
[16:36:56] <CarloWood> Were as my function only allows you to pass a relative error (a unitless factor).
[16:37:17] <CarloWood> The function you showed interprets epsilon as both - which is really weird.
[16:37:23] <Guest54> in my function, I'm interpreting epsilon as absolute for the 0 case, relative for non-zero cases
[16:37:34] <CarloWood> yes
[16:37:43] <CarloWood> that won't work
[16:37:49] *** climax is now known as gentooclimax
[16:37:57] <Guest54> can you point to me a test case where it doesn't work?
[16:37:58] <CarloWood> say x and y are both the result of round-off errors
[16:38:16] <CarloWood> x = 0.0000000000008 and y = 0.00000000009
[16:38:30] <CarloWood> you want both to be zero now. But line 12 is skipped
[16:38:41] <Guest54> ahhhh ok I get what you're saying
[16:38:52] <Guest54> in my case, one of the values is a lower bound explicitly entered in by the user
[16:39:08] <Guest54> so it's very unlikely that the user will put 0.00000008 instead of 0
[16:39:30] <Guest54> basically: 'a` is a user input value, `b` is a value from 3rd party api
[16:39:56] <Guest54> `a` values are quite likely to be exact and precise, and `b` values can be a bit funky
[16:40:24] <CarloWood> I think it is easier to imagine when thinking of the more general complex plane case :P
[16:40:25] <Guest54> so for eg, `a` can be 0, but `b` can be 8e-10

[16:41:23] <CarloWood> And you want them to be considered equal when they both fall in a circle with a fixed radius epsilon around their mean.
[16:42:23] <CarloWood> However, THAT breaks down when they are so huge that epsilon is comparible to the uncertainty in their mantissa.
[16:42:56] <CarloWood> Therefore, I think you need both: an absolute epsilon with the same unit, AND a unitless relative error.
[16:44:52] <CarloWood> Perhaps not both need to be inputs and you can make one of those a constexpr inside your compare function.

[19:01:23] <hachikuji[m]> as for anything else, obviously you can't enforce it because C++ allows non-const evaluation if you provide non-const parameters, so just don't do that...
