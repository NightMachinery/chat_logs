[00:01:32] <confuzeus> could this achieve what you are looking for unlist(lapply(names(l), function(x) {names(l[[x]]) <- rep(x, length(l[[x]])); l[[x]]})) ? talk about ugly code
[00:12:58] <rickyrick> Does f() return a vector of length 1
[00:15:03] <Bayes> rickyrick nope, a vector of length(x)
[00:17:35] <rickyrick> Yeah so sapply will return a list unless all of length(x) are the same
[00:17:45] <Bayes> for what is worth, the real f(x, varname) will scale the vector x based on the varname
[00:17:58] <Bayes> yeah I pointed that out before
[00:18:06] *** Quits: raffaem (~raffaem@45.91.20.167) (Quit: Leaving)
[00:18:06] <Bayes> hence why I unlist(lapply())
[00:18:19] <rickyrick> So do you just want to concatenate it all?
[00:18:23] <Bayes> so either I flatten before or after apply
[00:18:25] <Bayes> yep
[00:18:31] <rickyrick> Why not do.call(c, lapply())
[00:18:39] <Bayes> that to
[00:19:01] <Bayes> but once a while ago I decided to default to unlist instead of do.call(c, lapply())
[00:19:05] <rickyrick> lel
[00:19:15] <Bayes> really what I want is to do vectorize varname in f(x, varname)
[00:19:34] <rickyrick> Just use the Vectorize wrapper generator :^)
[00:19:41] <Bayes> so I can f(x, vector_with_varnames)
[00:20:27] <Bayes> confuzeus you're code is ugly indeed, here's an ugly code mention for you!
[00:21:12] <Bayes> if this were discord we could give you a badge :P
[00:21:32] <confuzeus> hahaha
[00:23:55] <confuzeus> i usually try from something that works then beautify from there. but i am not writing code for mars rover

[02:01:30] <Bayes> The DotProduct kernel is non-stationary and can be obtained from linear regression by putting  priors on the coefficients of
[02:01:31] <Bayes>  and a prior of N(0, 1) on the bias N(0, sigma_sq)
[02:01:40] <Bayes> wtf does that even mean
[02:23:29] *** Quits: palasso (~palasso@user/palasso) (Remote host closed the connection)
[02:24:00] <peddie> if it's a Gaussian process kernel, it just means fitting the kernel hyperparameters for this specific kernel simplifies to a well-known regression
[02:31:36] *** Quits: rinzewind (~rinzewind@user/rinzewind) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[02:32:03] <Bayes> peddie yup I'm reading doyproduct kernel in the context of a gp
[02:32:36] <Bayes> what's throwing me off is that the dot product need not be negative
[02:32:53] <Bayes> so I'm not sure how you'd use the dot product as a kernel
[02:35:11] <Bayes> that make sense?
[02:44:47] <peddie> are you asking whether the linear kernel is positive definite?
[02:45:16] <peddie> it just has to induce a positive-definite Gram matrix; it doesn't have to always return a positive value
[02:45:49] <Bayes> yep that
[02:47:53] <Bayes> so you're saying that taking the dot product k_ij = xi dot xj for every i, j will give you a matrix K that is PSD?
[02:48:52] <Bayes> cause I'm not sure I'm getting this right
[02:48:55] *** Joins: rinzewind (~rinzewind@user/rinzewind)
[02:49:10] <peddie> I believe so, but you can search for a proof online perhaps :)
[02:50:06] <peddie> or I can wave my hands and point out that the diagonal is always going to contain positive entries . . .
[02:50:18] <peddie> back in a bit
[02:50:19] <Bayes> N  <- 30; X  <- matrix(rnorm(N), ncol = 1); solve(X %*% t(X))
[02:51:01] <Bayes> peddie sure no problem, I'm following a book and a paper here I'm sure confused or just overlooking something
[02:52:08] <rickyrick> PSD or SPD
[02:52:50] <peddie> SPD only if you add a nugget, I suppose
[02:52:59] <rickyrick> If X is n-by-p, then X'X is symmetric positive-semidefinite
[02:53:21] <rickyrick> If n < p, then X'X is singular
[02:53:47] <rickyrick> If n >= p, then X'X is probably non-singular
[02:54:22] <rickyrick> Recall rank(AB) <= min(rank(A), rank(B))
[03:04:04] <Bayes> rickyrick set.seed(1); N <- 30; X  <- matrix(rnorm(N), ncol = 1); min(eigen(X %*% t(X))$values)
[03:04:45] <rickyrick> Oh you're computing XX'
[03:04:47] <rickyrick> That's different
[03:04:49] <Bayes> rite
[03:05:06] <rickyrick> Same applies, just swap A for B
[03:05:16] <Bayes> more specifically we were talking this https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.gaussian_process.kernels.DotProduct.html#r95f74c4622c1-1
[03:05:52] <Bayes> ie, using the matrix K with Kij = xi dot xj as a covariance matrix
[03:12:31] <rickyrick> Is the subscript on x the observation or the variate
[03:13:27] <rickyrick> Also in your example the first eigenvalue is just 24.96 followed by 29 zeros
[03:15:20] <Bayes> yeah it's numerical crap
[03:16:01] <Bayes> xi is the i-th row on the X matrix
[03:18:10] <Bayes> fuck it, the headache is killing me I'm bailing for the afternoon
[03:19:33] <Bayes> you all have a good night and god bless this country
