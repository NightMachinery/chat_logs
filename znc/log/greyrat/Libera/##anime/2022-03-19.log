[00:48:16] <Fenderbassist> lastonestanding: hi there, sadly no, I never did get around to buying any when the prices were good in the 90s
[00:48:33] <Fenderbassist> I always admired Gibsons for great builds and sounds
[00:48:47] <Fenderbassist> from the 2000's on, the prices were out of my reach just like the custom shop Fenders
[00:49:04] <lastonestanding> ohh bummer
[00:49:07] <Fenderbassist> was easier to pay a luthier $800 to build a bass from quality replacement parts
[00:49:17] <Fenderbassist> than buy the $1600 version Fender sells
[00:49:26] <Fenderbassist> all that money for the sticker....
[00:49:51] <Bco1981> looks like it was a 32bit vs 64bit that was my issue. wine running 64 and the windows app was the 32bit version... didn't mix well
[00:49:58] <Fenderbassist> I'm a blue collar bass player that takes "standard" models and upgrades them for half the price of the best models
[00:50:06] <Bco1981> but using the 64bit version actually looks like it works now
[00:50:14] <Fenderbassist> Bco1981: gratz :)

[03:43:23] <MootPoot> I only wrote java once for a android programming class
[03:43:26] <MootPoot> I had no fucking idea

[03:43:29] <MootPoot> why
[03:43:30] <MootPoot> where
[03:43:40] <Fenderbassist> I had Java back in my last degree program, one class
[03:43:49] <Fenderbassist> back then they were pushing it hard in Uni
[03:43:53] * MootPoot wishes they just made android use C# or something that makes sense
[03:44:06] <Fenderbassist> agreed, seems Java has issues
[03:44:08] <Fenderbassist> I'm not a programmer
[03:44:21] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I wish
[03:44:22] <MootPoot> JS might not be related to Java but seeing that they both have the "J" and both are trash
[03:44:23] <Fenderbassist> but I've heard some of them swear off of it as a language
[03:44:40] <Fenderbassist> I see
[03:45:32] <amigojapan> Js is not nearly as bad as Java
[03:45:36] <MootPoot> It's not the worst...jokes aside I would prefer Java over JavaScript but it's like being asked do you want to eat fresh poo or 1 day old poo
[03:46:09] <amigojapan> No JavaScript is much better than Java
[03:46:14] <MootPoot> I love c#

[03:47:19] <MootPoot> In its true form

[05:42:27] <ImoutoBot> [title] Gold Price History
[05:42:42] <jessedesu_onaph> Having gold sounds cumbersome
[05:42:47] <ButterNoodle> well
[05:42:49] <jessedesu_onaph> You need an agent
[05:43:04] <jessedesu_onaph> To actually convert it
[05:43:09] <jessedesu_onaph> To food and stuff
[05:43:25] <ButterNoodle> having paper that isnt suitable for reading, writing, ass wiping, or a fire is equally cumbersome
[05:43:57] <jessedesu_onaph> When ww3 starts maybe gold can be straight exchanged
[05:44:03] <ButterNoodle> and rn gold converts to $$ ez
[05:44:18] <ButterNoodle> people are glad to take ur gold for monopoly money
[05:44:41] <jessedesu_onaph> Right now I'm not worried
[05:45:22] <emmeka> in my neck of the woods, the radio reports the price of gold right after the weather
[05:45:34] <ButterNoodle> #metoo.. but I'm digging up an old mayo jar full of cash and exchanging it for gold tomorrow.. at a minimum I'm getting 2% a month in gains
[05:45:35] <emmeka> gold mines in these parts and all, and it's the major economic weathervane
[05:45:35] <jessedesu_onaph> $1 will buy you 2000 sheets of toilet paper
[05:45:57] <ButterNoodle> will 2000 sheets of TP get u 1$ tho
[05:46:17] <ButterNoodle> 5 year gains of 50%
[05:46:37] <emmeka> that's a strong bet on hyperinflation though.
[05:46:39] <ButterNoodle> its not BTC.. its not the NYSE..
[05:46:42] <coeus> once the supply is limited, you may not be able to get toilet paper at all
[05:46:53] <ButterNoodle> emmeka: thats what my plan is..
[05:47:21] <ButterNoodle> but over 20 years %563 in gains?
[05:47:28] <jessedesu_onaph> Dollars don't make good tp.  It's probably got coke residue
[05:47:46] <ButterNoodle> I dont think it will go down unless china unearths a gold deposit the size of a small city
[05:48:09] <ButterNoodle> jessedesu_onaph: yea dollars arent worth shit
[05:48:11] <ButterNoodle> literally
[05:48:20] <emmeka> I mean I think precious metals have a place in a portfolio in that they're a reasonable hedge since they perform well when inflation fucks money and the market doesn't compensate, but that's a pretty rare scenario
[05:48:26] <jessedesu_onaph> I don't like cash
[05:48:26] <emmeka> granted, it is the scenario we are in right now
[05:48:30] <jessedesu_onaph> I'm all debit
[05:49:10] <emmeka> the problem is that gold is a pretty terrible investment when the economy is doing well and inflation is low, which is most of the time.
[05:49:12] *** Quits: snake (~snake@user/snake) (Quit: Leaving)
[05:49:13] <ButterNoodle> nice.. when the financial institutions collapse, all that debt gets written off...
[05:49:14] <coeus> you guys do realize that someone bought out the currency market and is now laundering all your money using crypto currencies?
[05:49:17] <ButterNoodle> and sold to either china..
[05:49:21] <jessedesu_onaph> You know what's a hot commodity right now is iodine tablets
[05:49:28] <ButterNoodle> or taxed as income by the US government
[05:49:37] <ButterNoodle> jessedesu_onaph: I have some I can sell you
[05:49:47] <jessedesu_onaph> I'll take it
[05:50:13] <ButterNoodle> *price goes up by the gold bar when the icbm's go in the air :)
[05:50:21] <jessedesu_onaph> When nuclear sirens go off I'll be hitting the road down highway 1
[05:50:36] <emmeka> you and a million other people
[05:50:42] <jessedesu_onaph> Get as far as possible
[05:50:43] <ButterNoodle> yea
[05:50:48] <ButterNoodle> I'm not going anywhere...
[05:50:50] <emmeka> joke's on the world, I'm already upwind of anything worth nuking
[05:50:52] <jessedesu_onaph> From a city target
[05:51:19] <emmeka> the prevailing winds blow from the northwest here, and northwest of me is basically empty arctic, so
[05:51:29] <jessedesu_onaph> I'll be on a motorcycle to beat the traffic
[05:51:41] <jessedesu_onaph> Get my bug out bag
[05:51:47] <ButterNoodle> ft knox is close.. federal building in louisville is close.. camp atterbury is close
[05:51:58] <jessedesu_onaph> Camp wut
[05:51:58] <ButterNoodle> I'm cooked

[05:52:16] <emmeka> mmmm, well cooked buttered noodles
[05:52:17] <ButterNoodle> :)
[05:52:28] <jessedesu_onaph> What state has nukes
[05:52:36] <jessedesu_onaph> Other than. Orth dakota
[05:52:40] <ButterNoodle> emmeka: yes.. served Chernobyl style.. glowing
[05:52:57] <ButterNoodle> we use to have some in indiana
[05:53:34] <jessedesu_onaph> I think Vandenberg afb has all California's nukes
[05:53:57] <jessedesu_onaph> Maybe the naval station in seal Beach CA
[05:54:49] <ButterNoodle> we use to have some in south korea
[05:54:58] <jessedesu_onaph> I wonder if Russia is capable of launching all 7500 of its warheads simultaneously
[05:55:03] <jessedesu_onaph> Probably not
[05:55:22] <jessedesu_onaph> But I gotta wonder who is targeted first
[05:55:47] <jessedesu_onaph> Washington DC ofc
[05:56:00] <ButterNoodle> naa they are already working for them
[05:56:51] <ButterNoodle> we had some nukes in north indiana
[05:57:09] <ButterNoodle> but that went away with the titan silos
[05:57:27] <jessedesu_onaph> I stood next to a replica of little boy in the Travis afb museum
[05:57:42] <jessedesu_onaph> It's the size of a pickup truck
[05:58:08] <ButterNoodle> yea today u can get 10x the explosive power in a back pack
[05:58:24] <jessedesu_onaph> I saw a documentary about the 1980 missile silo accident
[05:58:28] <emmeka> doesn't really matter anyway, isn't that the whole notion of ICBMs, that they're a mobile platform

[05:58:50] <ButterNoodle> emmeka: yes.. a lot of mobile
[05:59:10] <emmeka> even assuming civilians had reliable information about where the nukes are at a given time, it is not necessarily where they will be if shit hits the fan
[05:59:11] <jessedesu_onaph> Submarines 
[05:59:35] <ButterNoodle> yea who knows on those
[06:00:09] <jessedesu_onaph> Submarine ICBMs are what guarantee that no one can win a nuclear war
[06:00:38] <jessedesu_onaph> It's a Mexican standoff
[06:01:04] <ButterNoodle> I mean we aint gonna be flying bombers on stanby without jetA
[06:01:40] <ButterNoodle> unless we can strap some solar panels on those b52s
[06:02:19] <jessedesu_onaph> Drones have 30 hours
[06:02:31] <jessedesu_onaph> Maybe strap a nuke on one
[06:02:46] <jessedesu_onaph> It's the size of a backpack after all
[06:03:19] <ButterNoodle> no one wants to use something that small tho
[06:04:51] <jessedesu_onaph> The new B-21 doesn't look too different than the B2 I wonder what's improved
[06:06:01] <jessedesu_onaph> B52s have to use cruise missiles, there's no way they can get close enough for gravity bombs
[06:06:15] <ButterNoodle> they slow
[06:06:38] <jessedesu_onaph> The B2 is slow
[06:06:41] <jessedesu_onaph> Subsonic
[06:06:52] <ButterNoodle> air drop is just dick measuring anyway

[06:07:22] <jessedesu_onaph> The B1 was designed to fly under radar
[06:07:48] <jessedesu_onaph> I think a youtube channel claimed air force one can go Mach 1
[06:07:52] <jessedesu_onaph> I doubt that
[06:07:59] <ButterNoodle> yes supersonic bombers were a thing
[06:08:16] <jessedesu_onaph> The XB-70 valkerie
[06:08:28] <jessedesu_onaph> Never got past prototype stage
[06:08:32] <ButterNoodle> looked cool.. but was an expensive shit piece
[06:08:45] <jessedesu_onaph> It's 1.3x the size of a B1
[06:08:47] <ButterNoodle> would like to see it at the museum
[06:08:54] <ButterNoodle> huh?
[06:09:11] <jessedesu_onaph> It collided with an F104

[07:31:06] <Fenderbassist> and the TV show was good, I don't think MadTV is still around
[07:31:11] <amigojapan> is it tied to Mad TV?

[07:31:40] <Fenderbassist> apparently MADtv ran from 1995 to 2016
[07:31:51] <Fenderbassist> was "inspired" by Mad Magazine
[07:32:30] <Fenderbassist> 1995-2009 for the main series, a 20th anniversary episode in 2015, and one more 8 episode season in 2016
[07:33:32] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: my dad was talking about commics from the 50s
[07:34:50] <Fenderbassist> Mad Magazine was founded in 1952, and is still around today apparently

[08:26:23] <Nanobot> Maybe they want to piggyback on the stronger "Hololive" brand and figure EN viewers won't care as much about the girls mixing with the guys.

[08:30:08] <Nanobot> No, it wouldn't be Calli announcing it. But, one of the songs on her new album sounds like it was written more for Demondice than for Calli. It's electroswing like Alcatraz and even has lines about throwing dice and demons.
[08:30:45] <Nanobot> Besides, Demondice just released an EP.

[08:35:57] <Nanobot> Calli herself doesn't mind in the slightest that people know about both of her personas (in fact, I'm pretty sure she'd prefer if people did), but her contract with Hololive doesn't allow her to tell people they're the same person or let her channels be a platform for saying it. So, she just winks and nudges a lot.
[08:38:08] <Nanobot> isekaijin: The latest Demondice EP is all about the journey of her state of mind from right after joining Hololive all the way up to the present. She wrote the songs during different phases during that time period.

[11:13:28] <Satin> it's not the worst but eh
[11:13:33] <Satin> i had spring break
[11:13:36] <Satin> this week
[11:13:49] <DunceCotus> did you enter in any wet t-shirt contests?
[11:14:01] <Satin> and the entirety of spring break was spent trying to purchase a car from a dealer to replace the car a drunk driver hit a month ago
[11:14:27] <DunceCotus> jesus drunking christ
[11:14:48] <Satin> since i live in new mexico, everything is spread out and i drove a lot to a major city back and forth, clocking 1k miles
[11:15:12] <Satin> the used mazda car the toyota dealership sold me was a lemon...
[11:15:38] <DunceCotus> 1k miles good gravy
[11:15:40] <ButterNoodle> oh
[11:15:45] <Satin> and it's just depressing, I'm demanding a refund and hopefully should get it now but im once again car less and worst of all the entirety of spring break

[11:16:41] <Satin> the 4th cylinder was clogged apparently
[11:16:42] <DunceCotus> lemons do not generally make for hardy vehicular chassis
[11:16:58] <Satin> and the entire engine head would need to be rebuilt 
[11:18:05] <Satin> i got the engine light on 30m after taking delivery of the vehicle on Wednesday
[11:18:12] <Satin> drove it back immediately
[11:18:24] <Satin> got it again on Thursday... again the issue happened 
[11:18:33] <Satin> take it back again etc...

[13:40:26] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: Thats what they say. I've never gotten it though, so people don't know what they are talking about.
[13:40:29] <KatrinValerie> Your nickname is kinda weird Kill-Animals 
[13:40:54] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: And I've eaten some of the most rotten raw meat you can imagine. 
[13:41:00] <amigojapan> Everyone tells them that KatrinValerie 
[13:41:01] <KatrinValerie> Don't we slaughter animals that we eat?
[13:41:02] <Kill-Animals> KatrinValerie: Thanks. You too.
[13:41:14] <KatrinValerie> It should be Slaugher-Animals, but that's a bit long
[13:41:15] <Kill-Animals> Sure do.
[13:41:21] <KatrinValerie> Maybe CamelCase
[13:41:28] <Kill-Animals> Slaughter is a bit visceral and offensive.
[13:41:42] <KatrinValerie> But kill makes it sound like a target assasination
[13:41:46] <Kill-Animals> I don't want people thinking I'm sort of freak
[13:41:59] <Kill-Animals> You think so?
[13:42:02] *** Quits: KirisameMarisa (~KirisameM@115.44.4.68) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[13:42:10] <KatrinValerie> The process really is a bit visceral and offensive in industrial meat production at least.
[13:42:11] <Kill-Animals> Assasinate-Animals sounds kind of silly.
[13:42:14] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: how about just "carnivore"
[13:42:39] <KatrinValerie> Yeah carnivore sounds much more acceptable
[13:42:59] <Kill-Animals> KatrinValerie: Nah, a lot of that is propaganda. There are recorded instances of Peta paying people to abuse animals on camera, just so they can drum up controversy.
[13:43:09] <KatrinValerie> Kill-Animals: we are just thinking about drama potential, you can keep this nick if it doesn't cause trouble.
[13:43:14] <KatrinValerie> Or if you don't cause trouble.
[13:43:37] <Kill-Animals> Carnivore? Meh kind of bland and unoriginal.
[13:43:43] <KatrinValerie> Kill-Animals: some fake pictures doesn't mean all of them are fake and honestly fuck PETA.
[13:44:12] <KatrinValerie> Their extremism does a disservice to the case for animal rights.
[13:44:16] <Kill-Animals> KatrinValerie: Yeah I've seen some things on 4chan, lol, that peta definitely didnt stage.
[13:44:20] <KatrinValerie> At least their form
[13:44:27] <KatrinValerie> Activism should not be deceptive in my book
[13:44:47] <KatrinValerie> If you need deception to push your issue, there is probably something fishy going on
[13:45:10] <Kill-Animals> Well they are obsessed with animals because they ironically crave eating them so badly, that they form a psychosis around them.
[13:45:35] <KatrinValerie> That's a weird explanation for activists behaviour
[13:45:38] <Sapphirus> mr. trollolol
[13:45:48] <Kill-Animals> If you look at vegan food, its all designed to emulate meat & fat, which is telling.
[13:46:00] <KatrinValerie> If you don't eat meat for a while you don't find it all that tasty anymore after a while, in my experience.
[13:46:15] <KatrinValerie> Kill-Animals: that's industrial vegan food though
[13:46:23] <Kill-Animals> KatrinValerie: yeah and there is some truth to that, given that your gut bacteria drives your cravings.
[13:46:31] <KatrinValerie> Although idk why emulating meat would be bad
[13:46:46] <Sapphirus> I'm literally allergic to greens, so meat and stuff mostly it is for me.
[13:46:46] <KatrinValerie> Meat is mostly a protein source and a vehicle for taste
[13:47:02] <KatrinValerie> You can do the same thing in vegan kitchen, I don't see how that devales vegan cuisine
[13:47:02] <Kill-Animals> KatrinValerie: Well even non industrial. Why do you think avacados are such a staple? Because its the closest fruit to something akin to fat.
[13:47:23] <KatrinValerie> Kill-Animals: you still need proteins and fats in a vegan diet, lol.
[13:47:26] <Sapphirus> I can consume night shade vegetables but not greens.
[13:47:35] <Kill-Animals> KatrinValerie: Emulating meat is bad because its toxic and kills people.
[13:47:37] <Sapphirus> Otherwise I get bad GI problems.
[13:47:42] <KatrinValerie> What
[13:48:18] <Kill-Animals> KatrinValerie: Vegan babies die at a super high rate.
[13:48:41] <KatrinValerie> What is your point?
[13:48:44] <Sapphirus> Veganism unfortunately is something that some people's biology can't even support. e.g. me being allergic to greens
[13:49:11] <Kill-Animals> Even a friend of mine, vegetarian, just had a miscarriage, and was having extreme trouble conceiving. The point of the matter is that its pushed as a safe alternative, when in reality it is the epitome of malnourishment.
[13:49:12] <Sapphirus> To suggest that it's a one-size-fits-all solution is ridiculous imho.
[13:49:24] <Kill-Animals> And should be considered cruelty towards humanity.
[13:50:24] <KatrinValerie> Sapphirus: you are allergic to all greens?
[13:50:27] <Kill-Animals> Sapphirus: Yeah and when you think about greens, unlike animals, they don't have claws or teeth to defend themselves. Thus the way they defend themselves is by producing toxins.
[13:51:18] <KatrinValerie> Sapphirus: our needs are largely the same though, there are differences in what we can properly digest and tolerate obviously and they need to be accounted for in any diet.
[13:51:29] <KatrinValerie> Yes a proper vegan diet is hard
[13:51:37] <Kill-Animals> Its also impossible.
[13:51:43] <Sapphirus> KatrinValerie, yep. Even a small amount of processed broccoli powder as an ingredient is enough to cause problems.
[13:52:09] <Kill-Animals> Vegans also worth noting, push a lot of drugs under the frame of "Supplements"
[13:52:10] <KatrinValerie> Sapphirus: being allergic to broccoli doesn't mean you are allergic to everything green
[13:52:18] <Cryowolf> https://store.steampowered.com/app/1149620/Gas_Station_Simulator/ now you can work at a gas station in the middle of nowhere, pay for it and not get any money in return!
[13:52:19] <ImoutoBot> [title] Gas Station Simulator on Steam
[13:52:21] <Sapphirus> Really I have to avoid anything that contains greenery, unless I want to be in a world of GI discomfort and pain.
[13:52:36] <Kill-Animals> Thus the drug companies love veganism as it promotes people to buy their drugs, which are often highly toxic themselves. 
[13:52:51] <Sapphirus> KatrinValerie, nah, it's everything green. Doesn't matter what it is. Source: Been there, done that.
[13:53:04] <Kill-Animals> ^hahaha
[13:53:10] <Sapphirus> Only vegetables I can get away with eating without GI problems are night shades.
[13:53:29] <Kill-Animals> Interesting; You deal well with nightshades...
[13:53:32] <Zoidberg> !addquote Kill-Animals zoidberg,  I was on chess.com, and they forcibly changed it to "Hug-Animals"
[13:53:32] <ImoutoBot> Zoidberg: Quote added for Kill-Animals (1)
[13:53:37] <KatrinValerie> Kill-Animals: there are mostly two things you might need to supplement in a vegan diet. B12 and certain fats.
[13:54:02] <KatrinValerie> Sapphirus: what about red beans?
[13:54:05] <KatrinValerie> Or lentils
[13:54:15] <KatrinValerie> Potatoes?
[13:54:22] <Kill-Animals> KatrinValerie: I mean there is more, but alot of nutrition you have probably never ever gotten in your diet, because you dont ever eat raw meat.
[13:54:27] <Kill-Animals> Taurine for example.
[13:54:32] <Sapphirus> KatrinValerie, those are all nightshades and they don't cause me any problems.
[13:54:50] <KatrinValerie> Kill-Animals: we do not have the digestive tract for raw meat
[13:55:07] <Kill-Animals> KatrinValerie: Yes we do. I've eaten it for 3 years now.
[13:55:21] <Kill-Animals> our digestive track is more similar to a cat's than it is to a cows.
[13:55:26] <Kill-Animals> or a pigs for that matter.
[13:55:37] <Cryowolf> we have it but we digest cooked meat much easier with the possible exception of fish
[13:55:41] <KatrinValerie> our ancestors may have been adapted to that at some point, but the more prevalent thesis is that humans anchestors only really went onto an omnivore diet after discovering fire.
[13:55:58] <Cryowolf> we were a lways omnivores
[13:56:03] <Cryowolf> we had to eat what w e found 
[13:56:16] <Cryowolf> mostly it was veggies,  fruit etc
[13:56:17] * Zoidberg eats ##anime:libera.chat 
[13:56:18] <lastonestanding> don't apes eat animals?
[13:56:30] <Kill-Animals> Cryowolf: Thats wrong. I can even prove it to you with a simple thought experiment.
[13:56:33] <KatrinValerie> Not all apes
[13:56:37] <KatrinValerie> xD
[13:56:38] <lastonestanding> I don't think that they only eat bananas
[13:56:40] <Zoidberg> ##anime:libera.chat is bitter
[13:57:05] <KatrinValerie> Well, if you count bugs I don't know
[13:57:11] <Kill-Animals> Cryowolf: Suppose you had two steaks. One raw, and one fully cooked. You both leave them in the fridge for two months, and now you are forced to eat one of them. Which one will you eat?
[13:57:13] <Cryowolf> what thought experiment? Science has shown that our digestive tracts digest cooked meat better
[13:57:15] <lastonestanding> aren't bananas from south america? how would apes even get those?!
[13:57:33] <KatrinValerie> We would need someone with more knowledge on apes and monkeys
[13:57:39] <Cryowolf> that's completely unrelated
[13:57:39] <Sapphirus> Kill-Animals, I've heard that some people are allergic to nightshades, but I seem to be fine with a diet of nightshades and meat. 
[13:57:43] <KatrinValerie> and maybe and evolutionary biologist
[13:57:44] <Zoidberg> Kill-Animals: how do you cook your steaks? medium rare I suppose
[13:57:53] <Kill-Animals> Cryowolf: lol okay you are just going to avoid the question?
[13:58:00] *** Quits: Satin (uid193953@user/Seten) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[13:58:06] <Kill-Animals> Zoidberg: I eat it raw. thats it.
[13:58:07] <lastonestanding> is eating worms and insects okay?
[13:58:12] <lastonestanding> or are those animals too?
[13:58:18] <Cryowolf> ok lets flip the question, smoked cooked meat
[13:58:21] <Cryowolf> same situation
[13:58:39] <Cryowolf> dry cooked
[13:58:54] <KatrinValerie> lastonestanding: we eat them in our sleep anyways, so honestly I cannot find a justification to not eat them, since we also never run close to really harming their population.
[13:58:57] <Cryowolf> dry-frozen and vacuum sealed
[13:59:01] <Kill-Animals> Sapphirus: You might be allergic to them, but just not know it. Because you eat it already, whatever you feel now, is your "Regular", but that doesnt mean you know what you are like until you cut them out completely.
[13:59:08] <KatrinValerie> But some vegans beg to differ
[13:59:20] <Cryowolf> but I dont have to avoid an irrelevant question
[13:59:23] <KatrinValerie> Honey is slave labour!!!!
[13:59:26] <lastonestanding> KatrinValerie: we don't harm the cow population either
[13:59:27] <Sapphirus> Kill-Animals, I can assure you I'm not, given the primary symptom is GI upset.
[13:59:28] <Kill-Animals> lastonestanding: No, just because a lot of insects and worms protect themselves by creating toxins.
[13:59:39] <Sapphirus> Add greens in and immediately I'm in for a world of hell.
[13:59:44] <Kill-Animals> There is also not that much nutrition in bugs.
[13:59:47] <Cryowolf> it sort of happens naturally
[13:59:48] <KatrinValerie> Well, tbh honey bees are kept in poor conditions and we should worry about that
[14:00:03] <lastonestanding> Kill-Animals: then why are certain predators immune to those toxins?
[14:00:09] <Kill-Animals> Cryowolf: Bruh, you are being dumb by changing the thought experiment.
[14:00:14] <KatrinValerie> And mostly one family of honey bee is used, which exposes us to a massive risk with a lack of wild bees
[14:00:20] <Zoidberg> why are we even discussing this?
[14:00:28] <Zoidberg> so silly
[14:00:40] <lastonestanding> you want to talk about penises instead?
[14:00:55] <Zoidberg> sure
[14:01:07] <Cryowolf> Kill-Animals, you remind me so much about that South Park Teen Paint Ball episode that came out the other week
[14:01:32] <Kill-Animals> Sapphirus: Well here I'll give you an example of what I mean. When I switched from a standard diet to a raw meat diet, my personality changed. I became way less neurotic and resentful. So what does that say about "nightshades" and whatever other non meats i was eating?
[14:02:06] <Cryowolf> how long you can store food and in what settings they can be stored has nothing to do with our ability to digest them
[14:02:19] <Sapphirus> I think that's something hard to measure since mood and emotion can be affected by lots of different variables.
[14:02:24] <Kill-Animals> lastonestanding: well cows have 4 stomaches. Pigs have long intestines. Birds have weirdly acidic poos
[14:02:34] <Cryowolf> and I would e at nothing that had been in the fridge for 2 months
[14:02:43] <Zoidberg> lastonestanding: are you backing off? no comeback?
[14:03:17] <Kill-Animals> Cryowolf: still avoiding the hypothetical. Just stop bro.
[14:03:49] <Kill-Animals> iIf you are going to be like, "Well in that hypothetical, Ill just invent a time machine and go back two months" its like... no.
[14:03:57] <lastonestanding> saganman: I'm no homo
[14:04:27] <KatrinValerie> lastonestanding: Can't talk about penises straight xD?
[14:04:39] <lastonestanding> it's a gay topic, no?
[14:04:53] <lastonestanding> I prefer talking about girls and womens
[14:04:54] <KatrinValerie> You can discuss penises on a purely educational level
[14:04:55] <Zoidberg> so you can't talk about penis without being gay?
[14:05:08] <Zoidberg> that's the definition of homophobia
[14:05:10] <Kill-Animals> People ask why we are talking about eating raw meat... cant we all just agree that it is simply an extremely interesting topic that no one talks about ever?
[14:05:11] <KatrinValerie> Zoidberg: I think there's internalized homophobia going on.
[14:05:16] <lastonestanding> what
[14:05:25] <Zoidberg> KatrinValerie: yeah, no kidding
[14:05:34] <KatrinValerie> The prevalence of bisexuality is estimated at like 49% last time I looked it up
[14:05:35] <Cryowolf> Kill-Animals, straw-manning arguments and saying "broh" whenever yo don't get it the way you want it isn't a good look
[14:05:43] <Sapphirus> Kill-Animals, unfortunately, there's a different type of raw meat on lastonestanding's mind.
[14:06:09] <Kill-Animals> Cryowolf: You are being incredulous. "I don't understand the point of the hypothetical, therefore there must be no point to the hypothetical". 
[14:06:42] <Cryowolf> and the point is?
[14:06:48] <KatrinValerie> So lots of people just deny their bisexuality, or come to the wrong conclusion that sexuality is a choice somehow because they find both masc and fem people sexually attractive.
[14:06:50] <Kill-Animals> Don't play the logical fallacy game with me Cryowolf. I am way too autistic to let anyone beat me at that game.
[14:07:01] <Kill-Animals> Cryowolf: Answer the hypothetical first. Think about it.
[14:07:07] <Cryowolf>  no
[14:07:16] <Kill-Animals> then I'll let your answer be my answer.
[14:07:19] <KatrinValerie> Kill-Animals: What hypothetical are you refering to?
[14:07:40] <Cryowolf> you can let whatever you want be an answer
[14:07:48] <Kill-Animals> KatrinValerie: Its a thougt experiment. There is no wrong answer, but it requires you to think about your decision and how you rationalize it.
[14:08:03] <Cryowolf> my autism has long reached an age where it can't  be bothered with these th ings
[14:08:03] <lastonestanding> I like lesbo sex, so I don't think that I'm homophobic
[14:08:04] <lastonestanding> lesbians are gay after all

[14:08:54] <lastonestanding> are lesbians a different type of gay?
[14:08:55] <KatrinValerie> in a non-healthy sexual way.
[14:09:40] <KatrinValerie> lastonestanding: nah, but many straight men fantasize about having sex with a lesbian couple, which is really unlikely to ever happen based on consent.
[14:09:57] <Cryowolf> KatrinValerie, bisexual couple then!
[14:10:05] <lastonestanding> oh wow. I dream about that too.
[14:10:22] <KatrinValerie> Cryowolf: and they need to be down for that kinda thing, if they are monogamous that might not turn out so great...
[14:10:31] <Cryowolf> obviously
[14:10:40] <Cryowolf> but some are adventurous, or drunk
[14:10:44] <lastonestanding> are you saying that lesbians are anti-penis?
[14:10:46] <KatrinValerie> lastonestanding: bro, wtf is wrong with you, get a bi couple 
[14:11:06] <KatrinValerie> lastonestanding: some are fine with girl penises, some aren't.
[14:11:08] <Cryowolf> lastonestanding, ask that on twitter if you want an interesting twitter war
[14:11:31] <KatrinValerie> Most lesbians never wonder about that kind of thing though
[14:11:35] <lastonestanding> but then I wonder if lesbians are okay with penis shaped dildos...
[14:11:48] <KatrinValerie> Some are, some aren't.
[14:12:05] <KatrinValerie> Which is not surprising. But the reason is pretty grim.
[14:12:06] <lastonestanding> are you lesbian?
[14:12:11] <Kill-Animals> KatrinValerie: hey! Stop ignoring.
[14:12:40] <KatrinValerie> Not entirely lastonestanding. And Kill-Animals, I am not that good at multi tasking, I will get to you. Patience

[14:13:06] * Kill-Animals goes and draws
[14:13:23] <lastonestanding> I read that women are great at multitasking
[14:13:25] <KatrinValerie> Kill-Animals: depends on whether I have a microwave oven or not and if I am in a rush or not.
[14:13:29] <lastonestanding> probably a myth
[14:13:43] <lastonestanding> I think that women are as stupid as men are
[14:13:46] <KatrinValerie> Microwave + rush, I would get the cooked one
[14:14:13] <Kill-Animals> KatrinValerie: You cant cook the steaks. You have to eat them as is.
[14:14:20] <DunceCotus> different brains, same stupid
[14:14:24] <KatrinValerie> lastonestanding: women are just expected to be better at it and you get better at stuff you practise from a young age on.
[14:14:57] <KatrinValerie> lastonestanding: a lot of differences between the ability in men and women are explained through nurture. Even the performance gap in some sports is mostly nurture.
[14:15:15] <DunceCotus> women seem less horny than men, yet can prolong orgasm
[14:15:23] <Cryowolf> Kill-Animals, you also didnt say what animal cause some animals that are uncooked actually become toxic after awhile, when cooked they just become...well disgusting and maybe salmonella
[14:15:25] <KatrinValerie> Kill-Animals: frozen?
[14:15:34] <lastonestanding> you mean that nature gave men big muscles and women big boobs?
[14:15:39] <Cryowolf> toxic like rycin stuff
[14:15:39] <KatrinValerie> I could not eat either then
[14:15:47] <Kill-Animals> KatrinValerie: Nope. Just in the fridge, rotting away.
[14:15:52] <KatrinValerie> Kill-Animals: your thought experiment makes no sense
[14:15:56] <KatrinValerie> Oh fridge
[14:16:12] <Kill-Animals> It could be on the counter sitting in the sun too. Makes no difference.
[14:16:30] <KatrinValerie> No
[14:16:48] <Kill-Animals> Cryowolf: I've eaten rotten raw meat. Never got sick. If anything, the opposite.
[14:16:49] <KatrinValerie> You need to preserve meat through a curing process
[14:16:53] <KatrinValerie> Otherwise it spoils
[14:17:16] <KatrinValerie> There are many different curing processes, but just letting it sit in the sun is sure to make it rot quickly
[14:17:20] <Kill-Animals> Cryowolf: lol KatrinValerie is just as bad as you. She can't answer either! hahaha
[14:17:41] <KatrinValerie> Kill-Animals: and no the raw steak rots first, I have seen an experiment on that 
[14:17:43] <KatrinValerie> wtf
[14:17:46] <Cryowolf> Do you have a superiority complex over us here? Think you're better than us?
[14:17:47] <KatrinValerie> Your hypothetical is BS
[14:17:47] <Kill-Animals> You just got to pick one that you think is safer. A rotten cooked steak or a rotten raw steak.
[14:17:51] <Cryowolf> do you Kill-Animals?
[14:17:53] <KatrinValerie> It was with a Burger though
[14:18:20] <Kill-Animals> Cryowolf: No I believe in God. Before him we are all equal.
[14:18:26] <KatrinValerie> Kill-Animals: I can eat neither, both are likely to kill me, wtf is your point? 
[14:18:29] <Cryowolf> oh please

[14:19:37] <Kill-Animals> Big difference.
[14:19:39] <Cryowolf> both actually
[14:19:41] <KatrinValerie> Because the meat diet fucked him
[14:19:48] <Kill-Animals> No it didnt, lol
[14:19:51] <Cryowolf> he talked about both in interviews
[14:19:58] <KatrinValerie> Also because he has a belief system that has to lead to depression
[14:20:03] <Kill-Animals> trust me, Ive been following him since 2008 before anybody ever heard of him.
[14:20:05] <KatrinValerie> but that is a different story
[14:20:29] <Kill-Animals> And he still does his diet, and credits it as saving his life. 
[14:20:54] <Kill-Animals> KatrinValerie: No, depression runs in his family. His father had it too.
[14:20:59] <Kill-Animals> and grandfather.
[14:21:10] <KatrinValerie> Cryowolf: He is not even relevent in his own field of research and believes in long abandoned theories.
[14:21:27] <KatrinValerie> He is not even a good speaker, the only way he got popular is by dunking on students.
[14:21:37] <KatrinValerie> And a lot of people dislike university students to begin with.

[14:22:15] <KatrinValerie> That his whole family had a fucked up world view doesn't mean it's in their genes
[14:22:41] <Kill-Animals> KatrinValerie: Yeah, diet isnt everything. But its not nothing. Nurture is something peterson will be the first to tell you, is deathly important.
[14:22:42] <KatrinValerie> Cryowolf: oh god, confused him with someone else there for a moment I am sorry

[14:23:14] <Cryowolf> yes he's kind of a dick
[14:23:21] <KatrinValerie> Hard to keep up
[14:23:22] <Cryowolf> Jordan Peterson speaks slowly, methodically
[14:23:26] <Kill-Animals> shapiro and crowder are cringe.
[14:23:30] <Cryowolf> he takes a lot of time to think
[14:23:47] <KatrinValerie> I find that he often remains too vague in debate
[14:23:51] <Kill-Animals> Shapiro is a snake in the grass. I really ended up disliking him after he was exposed during the groyper wars.
[14:24:17] <Cryowolf> KatrinValerie, he's vague on things he doesn't have a fully formed opinion on, or lacks information
[14:24:23] <Cryowolf> which imo is good
[14:24:26] <Kill-Animals> Crowder is... like how often does a guy have to dress up in drag as a "comedy bit" before we start asking questions?

[14:25:29] <Kill-Animals> KatrinValerie: Cryowolf is absolutely on point here. Peterson is frankly also too hi IQ for some people, and so he is easily misunderstood, or they think he's talking about nonsense.
[14:25:38] <Kill-Animals> high* IQ
[14:26:05] <Cryowolf> I dont think he is too high iq, he tries to make his speech available to everyone

[14:27:08] <Kill-Animals> Cryowolf: mmmm yeah he speaks in stories, but some things are like. I read his book, and he started talking about his weird perverted dreams. And some people took that as evidence that he was some crazy incest pervert,
[14:27:09] <Cryowolf> of debates etc
[14:27:15] <Cryowolf> he wasn't used to it
[14:27:32] <Cryowolf> then his stress built up at home when his wife got cancer
[14:27:40] <KatrinValerie> Cryowolf: i have probably mostly seen examples of when he's either being way too elaborate, or I don't really understand his mode of speech.
[14:27:40] <Kill-Animals> then the broader point was to discuss and peer into absurd dreams in and of themselves and try to derive meaning from them.
[14:27:41] <Cryowolf> and he started taking benzos
[14:27:46] <Cryowolf> got addicted to the benzos
[14:27:49] <Vohveli> To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Jordan Peterson. The lectures are extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of Freudian And Jungian metaphysical psychology most of the ideas will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Peterson's anti-nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Status-Quo literature, for 
[14:27:54] <Cryowolf> well physically dependant a nyway
[14:27:55] <Vohveli> instance.
[14:28:02] <Cryowolf> and he couldn't safely stop taking them

[14:28:18] <KatrinValerie> But I don't think that's a real argument

[14:47:19] <Sapphirus> What I like about vim's schema is that other CLI applications can easily replicate it.
[14:47:33] <Sapphirus> Advantage is that they are independent and aren't locked into the VIM ecosystem.
[14:47:45] <Kill-Animals> Sapphirus: I also like that its just better in every single way compared to emacs. It can even do email.
[14:48:05] * Urchin[emacs] uses Colemak layout
[14:48:16] <neonvortex> i use tr-f
[14:48:20] <Kill-Animals> Urchin[emacs]: waoh. Based? Maybe I misjudged you.
[14:48:35] <Kill-Animals> Urchin[emacs]: becomes Urchin[vim]
[14:48:41] <neonvortex> actually that was a lie only a maniac uses the f keyboard layout
[14:48:48] <JesseDesu> what does "red pilled and based" mean
[14:49:01] <JesseDesu> i see that on foxnews.com comments
[14:49:22] <Kill-Animals> JesseDesu: Redpill is from the matrix movie. If you have seen it its pretty easy to get what its getting at.
[14:49:27] <weebuwu> internet slang basically saying one person is good or level headed
[14:49:30] <neonvortex> a term originated from the hell known as 4chan, people use it on other people they agree with
[14:49:32] <Kill-Animals> based just means, human and genuine.
[14:49:51] <Kill-Animals> neonvortex: lmao go back to reddit. ywnbaw
[14:49:54] <Urchin[emacs]> well, red pill in Matrix was meant to represent Estrogen...

[14:50:13] <neonvortex> i mean ill be honest 4chan isnt that bad if you go to the right boards
[14:50:14] <Sapphirus> vim-like applications and vim follow closer to  the modularisation principle of the Unix philosophy than the monolith that is emacs.
[14:50:38] <neonvortex> i only use programs that do more than one thing
[14:50:43] <Kill-Animals> neonvortex: I tend to describe it as a magical place that you should never go to.
[14:50:58] <Urchin[emacs]> neonvortex: and what would those boards be?
[14:51:04] <neonvortex> /g/, /bant/, etc
[14:51:09] <Kill-Animals> So hell is not far off. Especially because once you go, you are there forever.
[14:51:12] <neonvortex> anything that isnt facebook fap thread
[14:51:23] <Sapphirus> Systemd and emacs have more in common, as they both try to do everything and succeed at mastering none imho 
[14:51:33] <Kill-Animals> neonvortex: How is /bant/? 
[14:51:45] <neonvortex> basically /b/ that isn't facebook fap thread
[14:51:57] <neonvortex> from the glory days
[14:52:07] <milkshake> so does killing innocent people is considered helping them to be in heaven?
[14:52:08] <Vohveli> JesseDesu: "red pilled" means awakened to some truth that previously eluded you
[14:52:25] <Sapphirus> Not that I don't like systemd -- don't take this as me professing to be an anti-systemd evangelical -- I don't actually mind it.
[14:52:32] <Kill-Animals> neonvortex: I tend to think /r9k/ is the funniest board, and /m/ is one of the coziest. /g/ ... Well #sqt is pretty awesome.
[14:52:43] <Sapphirus> But it's obvious that it doesn't adhere to some of the core tenants of the Unix philosophy.
[14:52:52] <neonvortex> /r9k/ is literally just porn

[15:40:41] <Kill-Animals> 2008 is when I first used IRC I think. That was right around when I installed linux

[15:43:50] <amigojapan> You must mean non Spanish in my car
[15:44:03] <Kill-Animals> hahaha, okay 
[15:44:08] <amigojapan> Cause I grew up in Mexico
[15:44:43] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: the first anime I watched was a robot anime called mazinger Z

[15:47:25] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: I have an odd question that you might be able to answer regarding dubs.
[15:47:40] <amigojapan> What's that?
[15:48:29] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: I find that english dubs, the voice acting is usually very ... it makes me ... I don't know. Want to tear out my innards with a bicycle wrench. With notable exceptions.
[15:48:52] <amigojapan> Ah yes
[15:49:21] <Kill-Animals> And so naturally I prefer hearing the original japanese. It occured to me however that perhaps the voice acting in japanese was also very cheesy, but because I can't understand japanese, it never occurs to me.
[15:49:41] <amigojapan> I think it is because Japanese voice actors actually go to voice actor school for a long time before they are allowed to voice anything
[15:50:00] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: so it is legitimately much more talented then?
[15:50:11] <amigojapan> Yes
[15:50:40] <Kill-Animals> Ive been wondering that for a long time. Thanks. 
[15:51:05] <Kill-Animals> I'm trying to think if there are any badly voiced animes in japanese. 
[15:51:10] <amigojapan> I saw a good video about a voice acting school, let me link you
[15:52:12] <Urchin[emacs]> Japanese also tend to get ambient noises a lot better
[15:52:45] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: I will say though, it is very poor when I hear japanese people speak in english roles, like for an american commander.

[18:25:52] <amigojapan> In Spanish it just needs black colour
[18:26:08] <amigojapan> Lol Fenderbassist 
[18:26:13] <Fenderbassist> Del being incorrect lol
[18:26:27] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: casa del oni
[18:26:30] <Fenderbassist> should be De but Del sounds funnier from the comedian I heard it from

[18:33:32] <Fenderbassist> yeah I rear ended someone when a person the next lane over just swerved over to our lane, causing his Collision Avoidance system to trigger and computer-controlled stop to happen immediately
[18:34:02] <Fenderbassist> I hit my brakes but they locked (anti lock failed to work) and I skidded...once you skid, it's only friction from the tires slowing you down and you sliiiiiiide
[18:34:26] <Fenderbassist> my car was 17 years old  hehe

[23:30:32] <ButterNoodle> small minds use adjustable desks.. 
[23:30:42] <ButterNoodle> big brains know what size desk to get the first time
[23:31:14] <MootPoot> But then how do you get the proper height for your suction cup onahole 
[23:31:21] <MootPoot> Sometimes you wanna do it standing 
[23:31:25] <MootPoot> Sometimes sitting 
[23:31:36] <ButterNoodle> use the wall dummy..
[23:31:43] <ButterNoodle> like I said.. big brain

[23:35:04] <sentionics> hey, Butter and Moot, it's being.
[23:35:13] <ButterNoodle> nice
[23:35:19] <ButterNoodle> beer check..
[23:35:27] <Bco1981> !
[23:35:32] <sentionics> kinda hungover from yesterday, but popping a fresh beer at the moment. Gonna be ok.
[23:35:33] <ButterNoodle> how many.. guessing 8
[23:35:38] <sentionics> Hey Bco1981
[23:35:42] <ButterNoodle> ?
[23:35:43] <Bco1981> hey sentionics 
[23:35:52] <ButterNoodle> first one today?
[23:35:58] <sentionics> ButterNoodle, yesterday I had 10, this is the first for today
[23:36:06] <ButterNoodle> woah
[23:36:33] <Fenderbassist> after a bit of the "hair of the dog that bit you", you can rehydrate with water
[23:36:47] <Fenderbassist> protect your body with water
[23:36:56] <Bco1981> i'm done wine'ing. it's just not good enough
[23:37:03] <ButterNoodle> water is pretty much the liquid of life
[23:37:04] <sentionics> Fenderbassist, yeah, I had a fair bit of water earlier. I should mix it in more, tbh. But I'm already pissing so much when I drink as it is.
[23:37:15] <ButterNoodle> Bco1981: switch to whiskey
[23:37:24] <Bco1981> i preffer rum
[23:37:27] <Fenderbassist> cleans you out
[23:37:34] <ButterNoodle> u spelled cum wrong Bco1981
[23:37:47] <ButterNoodle> ...
[23:37:56] <sentionics> ButterNoodle, I always drink way too much fireball. I've been avoiding it and sticking to beer. I'm not sure it's made much difference for me.
[23:37:58] <Fenderbassist> whiskey and water isn't a bad combo to avoid the harsh hangovers as long as you pace yourself and follow up with more water
[23:38:00] <ButterNoodle> or I've been spelling rum wrong all these years

[23:39:29] <Fenderbassist> there you go
[23:39:42] <sentionics> Fenderbassist, well, I don't know. after the last experience, it may be a long time before I want to try weed again, at all.
[23:39:46] <Fenderbassist> gotcha
[23:40:01] <Fenderbassist> just be aware there are strains that push and strains that relax
[23:40:03] <sentionics> I do miss the good times I did have on weed.
[23:40:19] <ButterNoodle> Bco1981: I wonder if gura is cute lil fish girl irl
[23:40:32] <Fenderbassist> indeed, I'm sure the right blend will do you some good
[23:40:42] <Bco1981> she is small
[23:40:44] <Bco1981> irl
[23:40:56] <sentionics> also, I think the last time, I probably just overdid the hell out of it. Should have started really light, but instead, went whole-hog and took like 4 times the starting dosage.
[23:41:03] <Bco1981> like loli small
[23:41:11] <ButterNoodle> I mean I can totally see coco in kson
[23:41:16] <Fenderbassist> that could have contributed to your mental overstimulation
[23:41:22] <Bco1981> :D
[23:41:23] <ButterNoodle> and see myself in kson too
[23:41:25] <ButterNoodle> deep
[23:41:31] <ButterNoodle> irl cute af
[23:41:46] <Bco1981> yes, many of the girls are.
[23:42:08] <Bco1981> thou with Calli, i preffer her avatar
[23:42:15] <sentionics> that said, tinctures/edibles are kind of a different animal anyway. They mostly only produce a body high from what I've read. I probably don't do so well with body highs.
[23:42:32] <ButterNoodle> unfortunately having a trophy vtuber wife would be bothersome - knowing soo many boys and girls fap to them
[23:42:43] <Fenderbassist> sentionics: you need that Maui Waui with a bit of Labrador in it that Tommy Chong had in Up In Smoke
[23:42:52] <ButterNoodle> lol
[23:43:11] <sentionics> lmao, that sounds like a drink

[23:43:33] <sentionics> is it over the rocks?
[23:43:34] <Fenderbassist> I recommend the four main Cheech and Chong movies to help you decide :)
[23:44:18] <Fenderbassist> yeah I have been told the same....dabs are different than pipes are different than bongs are different than jays are different than tinctures are different than brownies, etc.
[23:44:47] <Fenderbassist> according to Greg Proops

[23:45:38] <Fenderbassist> the first 5-10 minutes tells you much
[23:45:46] <Fenderbassist> the rest is pretty much about Greg's comedy career
[23:45:53] <sentionics> Yeah, I remember coming off a high from a vape in like 1.5 hours. But I was fucked up off the tincture I hit for the whole night.
[23:46:07] <Fenderbassist> might have been more concentrated
[23:46:12] <sentionics> tinctures also take a couple hours to actually start working too.
[23:46:22] <Fenderbassist> (that is a guess, I've done herbal tinctures but not cannabis)
[23:46:26] <Fenderbassist> I see, interesting
[23:46:41] <sentionics> I think it's like 2 hours they say, and that was about right.
[23:46:45] <Fenderbassist> Getting Doug With High is a fun channel to watch Doug smoke with lots of famous people
[23:46:47] <Fenderbassist> I see
[23:47:05] <sentionics> there is an initial effect, but the real high doesn't start until then

[23:47:59] <Fenderbassist> I agree with Chong's assessment
[23:48:09] <Fenderbassist> him just talking about the benefits
[23:48:15] <Fenderbassist> and how it's better for the body than alcohol
[23:48:23] <Fenderbassist> which I also agree with
[23:48:29] <Fenderbassist> booze has its place but not as medicine imho
[23:48:51] <sentionics> I agree.
[23:49:00] <ButterNoodle> ?
[23:49:09] <ButterNoodle> its good pain relief
[23:49:22] <Fenderbassist> booze works quickly but over time I don't think it's good on the body
[23:49:25] <Fenderbassist> even though it has uses
[23:49:33] <Fenderbassist> that's just my opinion though
[23:49:41] <ButterNoodle> fair enough
[23:49:51] <Fenderbassist> having drank quite a bit myself over the years rofl
[23:50:05] <Fenderbassist> I could line the walls with the bottles I've put down since the 80s
[23:50:07] <Fenderbassist> rofl
[23:50:29] <ButterNoodle> there are many people that can drink moderate amounts and not suffer much organ damage.. but I think a majority of people will experience issues with being casually drunk for years
[23:50:33] <Fenderbassist> thankfully I'm a total water addict so I've flushed myself out a lot despite the liquors
[23:50:47] <ButterNoodle> cant unfuck kidney damage
[23:51:00] <ButterNoodle> liver damage can lead to kidney damage
[23:51:04] <Fenderbassist> ButterNoodle: agreed, some people are stronger than others in this way
[23:51:19] <Fenderbassist> lots of water is what I suggest regardless of habits
[23:51:23] <Fenderbassist> usually
[23:51:30] <ButterNoodle> I think the liver can heal itself to a certain extent.. but there is a threshold
[23:51:56] <ButterNoodle> coffee and water
[23:52:13] <Fenderbassist> yes it is the only organ that regenerates, and if you use formulas like Himalayan blend or Milk Thistle you can help it along
[23:53:18] <ButterNoodle> 40oz of coffee and at least 60oz of water daily
[23:53:40] <ButterNoodle> I take a bunch of stuff including milk thistle
