[00:21:45] <Dr-007> TML, ive been reading up about the cache and activated all `php artisan optimize` stuff. its now twice as fast.
[00:21:58] <Dr-007> i havent done any profiling yet tho
[00:22:30] <Dr-007> but they were also talking about Use “Eager Loading” for Data instead of lazy loading
[00:22:54] <Dr-007> which is probably also a big hickup. so i think ill get there
[00:23:22] <Dr-007> but first im going to install memcached

[05:30:35] <Hash> https://3v4l.org/FKOt5 Why is this not allowed to create a new object on a class member?
[05:32:14] <Sammitch> you can't do much beyond simple assignments in a property declaration.
[05:33:55] <Blondie101010> what you assign to a property on class initialization has to exist at compile time
[05:34:24] <Sammitch> I would strongly advise passing dependent object in via the constuctor, but at the least you'd have to instantiate the `foo` in the `bar` constructor https://3v4l.org/t61bS
[05:34:27] <__adrian> property/argument defaults, constants, etc. are evaluated at compile time. objects, function calls, etc. can't exist until runtime.
[05:35:21] <__adrian> mm.  class Bar { public function __construct(public Foo $bar) {} }
[05:35:57] <Sammitch> yeah but that only works in 8.1 :P
[05:36:42] <Blondie101010> it's not as if it was hard to solve in any PHP version
[05:37:08] <__adrian> constructor promotion? 8.0

[05:46:46] <Blondie101010> hmmm, https://3v4l.org/3aXGG
[05:47:27] <Blondie101010> 8.1 for that
[05:47:34] <__adrian> yep
[05:47:54] <__adrian> though i'm not sure i like it  :p
[05:48:12] <Blondie101010> leads to wonder if they'll let property assignments become dynamic
[05:48:30] <Blondie101010> I'm not interested, but it's certainly doable
[05:48:33] <__adrian> i don't often need an object on construct but not a use-case-specific one

[06:18:25] <wallsY> Hey all, hope you're having a good day. I'm really new to PHP so I hope this is a silly/easy query. How do I display the name of the file the code is executing in? Similar to just echoing out "hello world", but I want it to print "filename.php". is there a built-in variable like $0 in bash that i can reference? thank you for your time reading.
[06:18:45] <__adrian> __FILE__
[06:18:50] <wallsY> thank you
[06:18:54] <__adrian> np
[06:19:08] <__adrian> note that's a (magic) const, not a $variable
[06:19:40] <wallsY> how would i call it in an echo()?
[06:19:50] <wallsY> without the $?
[06:19:51] <__adrian> echo __FILE__;
[06:19:55] <wallsY> ok cool
[06:20:45] <wallsY> thanks again, everything i was reading was talking about using basename() or teaching me how to actually print to a hardware printer lol -- knew there had to be an easy solution.
[06:21:49] <__adrian> now that i've told you how to do it, i'll tell you it's probably not something you'd ever want/need to do
[06:22:03] <__adrian> :D
[06:26:53] <wallsY> maybe you can help then haha, i'm a infosec student and i'm using this code to test for PHP execution on a vulnerable machine. i'm fuzzing a wordlist of potential filenames and ideally i'd like to have output with "Success: $filename" so I can curl the wordlist and grep the filenames that were succesful. you're right, __FILE__ doesn't seem to be working with my test environment.
[06:28:32] <wallsY> wait, it was actually my bad formatting that was causing the error lol -- but i think i can see why you don't recommend doing that -- is it because it leaks the absolute path on the back-end server?
[06:28:38] <__adrian> __FILE__ is the name of the current file (i.e., the file it is _actually written in_).
[06:29:49] <__adrian> you're _on_ the server or you're sending requests?
[06:30:47] <__adrian> re: recommend: it's not that i don't recommend it, it's just not something that's likely to be useful in real world use cases
[06:30:57] <__adrian> (not __FILE__ itself, but echoing it)

[07:24:01] <wallsY> it worked so thank you very much. Blondie101010 had it right, basically i was uploading 500 versions of the same file blind and needed to figure out 1. which ones actually uploaded, and then 2. of the ones that uploaded, which were allowed to execute on the server. i figured a hello world with the filename printed was the best way to do that so I could then curl back the results using my wordlist. i
[07:24:03] <wallsY> realized after the fact that i didn't even need the __FILE__ because i could reference which URL i was testing with the bash curl script, but it was still useful info :)

[18:53:42] <da_wunder> that really depends, there are cases when you don't need `id` column
[18:53:45] <teresko> for example, I was assured that a pivot table (ya know, the many-to-many thing), need an "id" column, because that makes it more consistent
[18:55:08] <teresko> hell, my original contention is that the PK for table "Users" should be called "user_id' and not just "id" to give an option for easier joins and semantic value
[18:56:16] <teresko> then again, it came from same genius, who insisted that newbies should be learning ORMs before having basic unserstanding of SQL
