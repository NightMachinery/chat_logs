[00:08:45] <[itchyjunk]> wtf
[00:08:54] <kuudes> "Evidence of cooked food is found from 1 million years ago,[20] although fire was probably not used in a controlled fashion until 400,000 years ago.[21] There is some evidence that fire may have been used in a controlled fashion about 1 million years ago.[22][23] Evidence becomes widespread around 50 to 100 thousand years ago, suggesting regular use from this time; interestingly, resistance to air pollution started to evolve in human populations at a 
[00:08:54] <kuudes> similar point in time.[21] The use of fire became progressively more sophisticated, with it being used to create charcoal and to control wildlife from 'tens of thousands' of years ago.[21]"

[00:09:26] <[itchyjunk]> huh that 50 to 100k was how my book claimed it
[00:09:52] <[itchyjunk]> so modern humans evolved post fire? interesting.
[00:09:54] <kuudes> there are theories that fire use caused homo sapiens
[00:10:00] <kuudes> iirc
[00:10:05] <gwern> people eat raw meat now, you know
[00:10:16] <gwern> I posted a link about a dude boasting about being on raw meat only for 3 years the other day
[00:10:17] <[itchyjunk]> I thought the whole idea behind raw veganism was that "it was natural for humans to eat everything raw" or somesuch
[00:10:17] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah, it's called the paleo diet
[00:10:27] <gwern> PapuaHardyNet: I thought paleo still cooked?

[00:20:51] <saturn3> Obormot\Arcturus: yeah i guess. it seems like there's more going on than a simple "fuck you" though
[00:21:26] <kuudes> galambo, yes, it is
[00:23:22] <[itchyjunk]> I don't like this mandatory vaccination for corona chan idea too much
[00:23:44] <[itchyjunk]> My uni is making it mandatory starting next semester. they expect several thousand students to just drop out
[00:24:06] <PapuaHardyNet> undergrad or postgrad?
[00:24:25] <PapuaHardyNet> or PhD student, that's actually more likely now that I think about it
[00:24:35] <galambo> kuudes, I am against mandatory vaccination
[00:24:42] <gwern> why do they expect several thousand? they know that employees are generally resisting at like 0-1% rates, right?
[00:25:01] <[itchyjunk]> idk, the uni has about 38 k students
[00:25:12] <gwern> I know students are lazy and attrit away a ton and probably more will take vaccines as a semi-socially acceptable excuse to drop out, but like 10%?
[00:25:23] <[itchyjunk]> "they" did a few survary and think about that many might drop out
[00:25:39] <gwern> "mom, I can't go to school next semester, they're injecting dangerous untested microchips in us!"
[00:25:42] <saturn3> i would like it if police just went around tackling people and giving them vaccinations by force
[00:25:59] <PapuaHardyNet> it's easy to be courageous in a survey
[00:26:20] <[itchyjunk]> yeah, it's unclear how many would drop out
[00:26:25] <[itchyjunk]> i won't be around to find out either
[00:26:26] <gwern> [itchyjunk]: meh. meaningless cheap talk then. similar numbers of people were saying that before the various mandates, but when the rubber hit the road, 0-1% and I bet those were going to attrit for other reasons anyway
[00:28:11] <[itchyjunk]> Is non vaccine rate that low? 0-1% ?
[00:28:31] <[itchyjunk]> what was all the fuss for then? i thought a lot of people were against it
[00:28:47] <[itchyjunk]> (though i think people will just stop getting the boosters, unless they make that mandatory too)
[00:28:59] <gwern> [itchyjunk]: no, firing/resignation rates for non-compliance
[00:29:17] <gwern> actual vaccination rates depend on stuff like age groups
[00:29:30] <gwern> it's 0% in kids etc
[00:29:55] <gwern> so you can hit 100% vaccination rates in your remaining employees while firing only 1% and the overall net population rate being 70% or whatever

[00:37:35] <kuudes> thanks for the answer galambo
[00:38:12] <kuudes> saturn3, basicly over here the law allows such
[00:38:40] <kuudes> I am for the officials using patient records to check who have so far not got vaccine and call or meet them and ask officially if they would like to get vaccine
[00:39:07] <kuudes> but law indeed allows basicly hunting people down to vaccinate them. but we haven't dared yet to make a statute that orders such
[00:39:23] <ggreer> I think a lot of companies/schools are just doing don't ask don't tell. my employer hasn't asked me about my vaccination status at all
[00:39:31] <gwern> looking forward to the antiantivaxx hunter-saver drones
[00:39:46] <kuudes> yes, employers are not allowed to ask about vaccination status here either, it would require a law
[00:39:56] <saturn3> kuudes: sounds good
[00:39:59] <ggreer> they can totally ask here. many just don't
[00:41:19] <kuudes> gdpr etc
[00:41:37] <kuudes> health information is specially protected information, requires a law
[00:42:06] <kuudes> but the officials can order health inspections which include checking for vaccination status or covid test, by a doctor, who can then say a person is not ok to work or not

[00:43:39] <kuudes> it is interesting that the mandatory vaccination paragraph has its base on smallpox vaccinations
[00:44:07] <kuudes> so basicly the constitutional council has already agreed it may be ok to forcefully inject people with substance that will kill 2 per million causally
[00:44:34] <kuudes> because smallpox vaccine does that. known causal side effect for that includes death
[00:45:01] <kuudes> which is why it is not used normally - would be if we have such and russia releases smallpox
[00:45:40] <kuudes> we surely destroyed the "lost" smallpox vaccines a decade ago when they were found, because possession is against international treaties
[00:46:18] <kuudes> how many people covid vaccines have killed so far btw?
[00:47:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... 0?
[00:47:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> I haven't heard of any yet, at least... seems like that would've made the news?

[00:47:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh yeah I guess the AZ one

[00:55:02] <galambo> kuudes, at this point I believe being unvaccinated is akin to smoking or dangerous driving. yes you are exposing other people to risks, and yes I should be shaming you for your reckless actions. but I dont think the government should force you to be vaccinated.
[00:55:03] <kuudes> 3 confirmed deaths from janssen, 8739657 doses given, so 1:3M
[00:55:14] <kuudes> galambo, yes. but icu use?
[00:55:35] <galambo> kuudes, yes smokers and reckless drivers also go to icus
[00:55:46] <kuudes> yes, but not that long or that fast
[00:56:22] <kuudes> with current vaccination levels in finland (5.5M pop) we should imo expect at least 2000 covid deaths if covid goes through population
[00:56:22] *** Quits: Lord_of_Life (~Lord@user/lord-of-life/x-2819915) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[00:56:22] *** Lord_of_Life_ is now known as Lord_of_Life
[00:56:23] <galambo> if you think about it in that way, it is the healthy people who live to 95 years old who drain healthcare and pension resources
[00:56:33] <kuudes> no no, wait, listen
[00:56:47] <kuudes> there appears to be about 5 persons in icu per death
[00:56:56] <kuudes> an icu tour for covid takes about 2 weeks
[00:57:09] <kuudes> so those 2000 deaths imply 2000*5*2 = 20000 weeks of icu use
[00:57:29] <saturn3> i guess i would be willing to accept a large tax for being unvaccinated instead of mandatory vaccination
[00:57:37] <kuudes> the authorities say that icu use of over 50 beds to covid causes planned icu use to cease, such as operations
[00:57:46] <kuudes> at max we have 500 icu beds in Total War case
[00:58:05] <kuudes> 20000/50 = 400 weeks
[00:58:10] <kuudes> 20000/500 = 40 weeks
[00:58:24] <galambo> kuudes, again the same principle applies to reckless drivers and smokers. so we can criminalize smoking and speeding. and we can also privatise national healthcare. or we can accept that freedom has its costs.
[00:58:26] <kuudes> so it takes about a year in any case for those covid icu uses
[00:58:44] <kuudes> or. if it goes faster, such as in 100 days, then we will kill additional 8000 persons for lack of icu
[00:58:47] <saturn3> we do criminalize speeding and tax smoking
[00:59:15] <galambo> well we can tax people who dont want the covid vaccines
[00:59:16] <kuudes> also we mandate speed cappers in some cars
[00:59:53] <kuudes> we also tax alcohol by up to 300% etc
[01:00:07] <kuudes> and cigarettes to similar heights, and limit their sales times
[01:00:15] <galambo> whatever either of us thinks doesnt matter. we can influence government policy. and governments are incompetent and will bungle things up. so none of this matters.
[01:00:25] <galambo> we cant*
[01:00:32] <kuudes> ~
[01:00:38] <kuudes> maybe
[01:01:02] <kuudes> but over here we indeed have already a law that allows mandatory vaccination regulation to be instantiated by the government
[01:01:18] <cpopell> @galambo it is 100% true about who drain healthcare/pension resources, I believe
[01:01:19] <kuudes> it needs no parliament process, government has the power to order mandatory vaccination to all or some people
[01:01:32] <saturn3> i think it's much easier to influence the government in finland
[01:01:38] <kuudes> but those covid people won't just kill themselves but other people who are out of icu
[01:02:06] <kuudes> ie if we have 70 year old twodosed and 30 year old 0 dosed, which of them should get an icu bed?
[01:02:07] <galambo> kuudes, yes well you see I had a similar problem with my country. I didnt like its laws. so I decided to leave the country. there isnt much else one can do about it.
[01:02:10] <galambo> its like a package
[01:02:14] <galambo> you take it or leave it
[01:02:32] <kuudes> I have caused a copyright law to be thrown out of parliament to next parliament for 4 years
[01:02:41] <kuudes> personally.
[01:03:10] <kuudes> I explained the situation to parliamentarians I knew, and they decided against that
[01:03:20] <galambo> kuudes, yes well I personally participated in overthrowing my own government in 2011. that didnt do much in the end.
[01:03:26] <kuudes> we are a small country. you can drink beer with parliamentarians here
[01:03:42] <kuudes> and they take a tram to work
[01:04:37] <galambo> people are stupid and immoral. and parliamentarians will do what it takes to please the people.
[01:04:39] <kuudes> but the question is if it should be done or not

[01:33:11] <saturn3> kuudes: no, it's a more refined version
[01:33:50] <galambo> kuudes, I havent done much research but I tend to trust uptodate: https://www.uptodate.com/contents/covid-19-vaccines-to-prevent-sars-cov-2-infection#H3028733980
[01:33:51] <Robomot> UpToDate ({{configCtrl2.info.metaDescription}})
[01:36:27] <kuudes> ema recommends booster to general population 6 months after second dose
[01:36:59] <kuudes> https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/comirnaty-spikevax-ema-recommendations-extra-doses-boosters "For the latter, the CHMP has evaluated data for Comirnaty showing a rise in antibody levels when a booster dose is given approximately 6 months after the second dose in people from 18 to 55 years old. On the basis of this data, the Committee concluded that booster doses may be considered at least 6 months after the second dose for people aged 18 years and older."

[01:37:13] <kuudes> which is to more people than cdc recommends in that uptodate
[01:37:35] <kuudes> over here in finland they recommend against third doses so far but for selected few people such as myself
[01:38:09] <kuudes> galambo, so it appears with covid boosters the medical authorities are not in line
[01:38:37] <galambo> uptodate makes a weak recommendation and explains their rationale.
[01:39:05] <kuudes> and over here the justice system has reprimanded the medical authorities that they must tell when they are making recommendation and when they order, and tell the people they recommend to, that the decider such as doctor must themselves find out if the recommendation is legal and sane
[01:39:13] <kuudes> because they can recommend illegal things
[01:39:34] <galambo> also uptodate says 'The benefits of vaccination greatly outweigh the rare risks of specific adverse events.'
[01:39:42] <kuudes> so it is up to doctors such as you to decide what to do per each patient's benefit
[01:39:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> "It’s hard to talk about IQ research without getting accused of something something Nazis. But here’s a claim that actually, Nazis hated IQ research, worrying that it would “be an instrument of Jewry to fortify its hegemony” and outshine more properly Aryan values like “practical intelligence” and “character”. Whenever someone tells you that they don’t believe in IQ, consider calling them out on perpetuating
[01:39:44] <Obormot\Arcturus>  discredited Nazi ideology." ... hah
[01:40:53] <kuudes> currently the health minister is demanding the vaccination expert group to make a decision on use of third doses, which we have in stockpile, but can't jab people with because lack of medical recommendation
[01:41:24] <kuudes> ie we will soon have to throw to garbage some 1/5 population worth of vaccines unless we get to use them
[01:41:41] <kuudes> any doctor can write a prescription to any person though
[01:41:50] <kuudes> as off label use
[01:43:45] <galambo> kuudes, I follow the NICE guidelines. I also read the US/european guidelines/uptodate and other resources. I dont think there is any ambiguity about recommending the vaccine.

[01:56:15] <kuudes> galambo_, over here you are not allowed to get third dose unless you are immune deficient or have got vaccine with 3 week interval
[01:56:29] <kuudes> most of population has got the vaccine with 6-12 week interval

[02:00:19] <galambo_> it is not a joke. its true!
[02:02:24] <Dyo> for encephalitis the spacing was similar, ~1-3 months. 3rd dose 9-12 months after that. but unlike w encephalitis, you can get the vaccine, then get exposure to actual covid, recover and have highest antibody count that way.

[02:06:16] <kuudes> have you tried burning your lawn?
[02:07:20] <kuudes> btw do we have info on if it would be beneficial to get infected after 2 or 3 doses to get better protection against vaccine evading variants such as mu?
[02:08:51] <Dyo> don't know anything about mu variant.
[02:12:30] <Dyo> hm apparently vaccines are less effective against it but far from completely useless (70-80% efficiency). so yeah going by main metric of more antibodies=better, what you said would likely be beneficial

[03:56:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... mineral content? wtf?
[03:56:51] <Dyo> i.e. how much of the grain is used in the flour
[03:57:05] <Dyo> if you burn it and weight the remains you get... mineral weigh
[03:57:06] <Dyo> t
[03:57:13] <Dyo> cause they don't burn
[03:57:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok so that sounds like the same thing as protein content
[03:57:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> But ok, so presumably cake flour is available... why bother with the starch then... weird

[03:58:10] <Dyo> of practical importance are only 405, 550 (bread) and 1050, as far as wheat is concerned. wholegrain would be somethng like 1600 but is only called wholegrain (Vollkornmehl)
[03:58:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> What's a treated lemon
[03:58:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh, there's nothing less than 405??

[03:59:51] <gwern> ...how much space does 1kg of whipped cream take up?
[04:00:39] <Dyo> same as milk I think

But after we turned the papers in, the people running the workshop
[05:20:37] <feepbot> revealed that there was a number written in the top right corner of each sheet of paper (like where a page number would usually be), and half of us had gotten one number (relatively big, like 50 or something), and the other half a different number (smaller, like 2). I don't remember the specifics but the effect size (using the term colloquially) was ridiculously huge, where the

[06:21:47] <feepbot> This suggest that there are features even in specific natural domain which generalize well to all sorts of other natural domains. As for few-shot performance on non-natural image datasets, surprinsingly, scaling the training datasets such as Aircraft, Bird, Describable Texture, Flower and Fungi results in better performance on Omniglot, a character dataset, see Figure 4.

[07:08:25] * gwern notes for the record that he finally bought a decent frozen pizza - a chicago deepdish frozen pizza, of all things, from aldi. it has pepperoni but not overwhelming the sausage. astonishing. what a pity he undercooked it :(
[07:09:34] <quanticle> feep, gwern: https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2021/10/14/dead-end-sf-street-plagued-with-confused-waymo-cars-trying-to-turn-around-every-5-minutes/ This is actually adorable
[07:09:34] <Robomot> Dead-End SF Street Plagued With Confused Waymo Cars Trying To Turn Around ‘Every 5 Minutes’ – CBS San Francisco (A normally quiet neighborhood in San Francisco is buzzing about a sudden explosion of traffic. Neighbors say their Richmond District dead-end street has suddenly become crowded with Waymo vehicles.)
[07:10:05] <quanticle> "At several points this Tuesday, they showed up on top of each other. The cars, packed with technology, stop in a queue as if they are completely baffled by the dead end. While some neighbors say it is becoming a bit of a nuisance, everyone finds it a little bizarre."
[07:10:15] <gwern> yeah, I was puzzled by that too. it being such a persistent glitch implies there's somethin more fundamental going on, but redditors didn't think that a movement restriction like no left turns could be driving it given the google maps of the area
[07:13:17] <quanticle> gwern: Is Durarara good?
[07:13:27] <adiabatic> quanticle: yes
[07:13:44] <adiabatic> well, I liked it. This is only very loosely correlated with quality.
[07:14:06] <gwern> likewise. it's generally praised by critics so maybe it's also good?
[07:14:26] <PapuaHardyNet> is it Fate/Zero like in its goodness?
[07:14:33] <gwern> it's very otakuesqye and I'm not sure the first one's plot actually winds up being all that satisfying, but it does fun worldbuilding
[07:14:34] <quanticle> What does that mean?
[07:14:44] <quanticle> Re: "like Fate/Zero"
[07:14:55] <adiabatic> I don't think it's anything like Fate/Zero, but I liked Fate/Zero too. I saw it before UBW.
[07:15:20] <saturn3> quanticle: okay fine
[07:15:21] <gwern> if you mean loads of satisfyingly flashy fight scenes, well, durarara has plenty but that's not the focus
[07:15:28] *** saturn3 is now known as saturn2
[07:15:33] <PapuaHardyNet> that's subjective, I used the word goodness meaning "goodness based on your definition of good"
[07:16:26] <quanticle> saturn2: No, no, you didn't have to switch, I'm sorry. But... yes, saturn2 flows off my fingers much more naturally than saturn3
[07:16:52] <adiabatic> is it just me, or is it weird that "information broker" isn't a meme in America for media
[07:17:04] <adiabatic> or is this actually common and I'm just not paying attention
[07:18:27] <saturn2> a meme for media?
[07:18:36] <quanticle> As I understand it, "information broker" doesn't refer to media but rather refers to all those slightly (and not so slightly) shady companies that gather tracking, location, demographic and behavioral data and sell it to advertisers. You hear about them every so often when one gets hacked and the headlines read something like, "Literally everyone's personal information has been spilled across
[07:18:38] <quanticle> the Internet"
[07:18:51] <adiabatic> like, I see them in anime often enough, but not in western anything
[07:19:06] <adiabatic> then again I haven't seen all that much anime, so maybe I'm overindexing on durarararaararararabanana
[07:19:18] <gwern> there are information broker characters in SF fairly frequently. I can think of several in star wars alone
[07:19:37] <saturn2> the cia uses "information broker" to mean someone they don't think deserves first amendment rights
[07:19:42] <gwern> I suppose private spy companies like black whatever might count
[07:20:39] <quanticle> I haven't see Durarararararara, so I'm not sure about the context, but in Western media, "information broker" definitely has connotations of "shady character". As in, this person has information that they're strictly not supposed to have. You don't ask them how they acquired said information, and they don't ask you how you're going to use said information.
[07:21:24] <quanticle> saturn2: I thought they'd upgraded Wikileaks to "non-state intelligence agency"
[07:21:34] <quanticle> Which I found absolutely hilarious, btw
[07:21:47] <saturn2> yeah that too
[07:22:11] <adiabatic> I mean, the info broker in Durararara _is_ a shady character and not half bad at running xanatos gambits
[07:22:15] <saturn2> glenn greenwald was the "information broker"
[07:22:20] <quanticle> Ah, okay
[07:22:33] <adiabatic> but I only saw three episodes of Gargoyles (two uniques), so…
[07:22:58] <gwern> quanticle: oops. you stuttered
[07:24:20] <quanticle> Eh?
[07:24:52] <PapuaHardyNet> hey, a xanatos gambit in anime? now I'm going to watch durarara
[07:25:20] <PapuaHardyNet> (how do you remember how many ra's? I've memorized it, of course
[07:25:29] <gwern> quanticle: I forgot how you're supposed to point out you mispelled durararara, so I skipped to the punchline
[07:25:54] <adiabatic> PapuaHardyNet: how many are there?
[07:25:58] <adiabatic> Four?
[07:26:06] <gwern> PapuaHardyNet: why bother? it deprives you of the opportunity for Monogatari jokes
[07:26:25] <Filipepe> oh, so it isn't a joke, that's the anime's name?
[07:26:28] <PapuaHardyNet> three, like I just used it
[07:26:42] <adiabatic> Oh, three, just like for KoL pirates?
[07:26:47] <adiabatic> that's easy to remember
[07:26:51] <PapuaHardyNet> I haven't seen anything of the monogatari series yet :(
[07:27:05] <adiabatic> I liked my banana-problem joke just as well, anyway
[07:27:16] <quanticle> gwern: I figured if three 'ra's are good, and four are better, then seven must be quite excellent

[07:37:05] <adiabatic> oh
[07:38:57] <Filipepe> does Musk still insist in no LIDARs?
[07:40:00] <gwern> very much so
[07:40:43] <Filipepe> gwern: what do you think of this, specially as LIDARs have become relatively cheap, especially compared to Teslas?
[07:42:44] <Filipepe> (I mean, to a Tesla full price)
[07:46:18] <gwern> still seems like a bad idea to me, yeah
[07:55:42] <saturn2> "But I'm pretty irked that the upshot of all this is a little-endian web. We can't rely on even non-WebGL JavaScript to be system-agnostic anymore and that seems like a pretty badly broken promise about how architecture-independent the Web was supposed to be. I realize this outcome wasn't at all the intention when Mozilla introduced it, but by making simple tools to turn compiler output into ready-to-use
[07:55:42] <saturn2> asm.js that's what was inevitably going to happen, and now that developers are finding asm.js too tempting to ignore, that's exactly what is happening."
[07:55:47] <ggreer> IIRC lidars have weird failure modes, especially when you have a lot of them in close proximity
[07:56:36] <saturn2> any architecture you want as long as it's intel or arm

[07:59:52] <ggreer> also you need to do sensor fusion with the cameras to recognize signs and lights
[08:05:03] <ggreer> radar is cheap to add to cars but tesla also stopped using it because sensor fusion was such a pain. now most teslas drive around with a disabled radar
[08:07:10] <ggreer> oh I forgot the other big issue: lidar requires far more compute than cameras
[08:12:13] <ggreer> apparently lucid claims they'll have lidar on their car. they claim many things though
[08:13:53] <quanticle> saturn2: Yeah, I was frustrated by that too

[08:25:58] <quanticle> The other thing that killed TenFourFox was Rust
[08:26:09] <quanticle> There's no Rust compiler for 32-bit PowerPC
[08:26:31] <adiabatic> so, like, CSS was paused forever?
[08:26:58] <quanticle> CSS grid support was at best iffy
[08:27:10] <quanticle> And I don't think anything beyond that landed
[08:28:12] <adiabatic> now I wonder if anyone's made a Gemini browser for PPC
[08:29:03] <quanticle> http://calculist.org/blog/2012/04/24/the-little-endian-web/
[08:29:05] <Robomot> The little-endian web? (Here’s the deal: typed arrays are not fully portable. On most browsers, this code will print 1: var a1 = new Uint32Array([1]); var a2 = new Uint8Array(a1.buffer); console.log(a2[0]))
[08:29:43] <adiabatic> "almost all platforms are little-endian these days" FAKE NEWS!
[08:30:54] <quanticle> "This leaves big-endian browsers with a nasty decision: try to emulate little-endian typed arrays to protect against unportable application logic, and suffer the complexity and performance costs of translating data back and forth to the GPU, or just hope that not too many web pages break. Or perhaps surface an annoying decision to users: do you want to run this application in fast mode or
[08:30:56] <quanticle> correct mode? For now, we should let browser vendors on big-endian systems make that decision, and not force the decision through the spec."
[08:30:58] <quanticle> Or, we could take option 3: kill the Batman^W Big-endian architecture
[08:31:22] <nshepperd2> big-endian platforms are a russian psyop
[08:32:00] <quanticle> s/Russian/Iranian/
[08:33:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> This is truly bizarre
[08:34:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> The fact that browsers need to care about such things just seems insane to me
[08:34:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> Does this not completely defeat the point of the web in the first place???
[08:34:38] <saturn2> well, we got rid of flash
[08:34:41] <quanticle> Yeah, well, this is the trouble you run into when you turn browsers into fully general application distribution platforms, and then try to get said application distribution platform to run at native speed.
[08:34:57] <saturn2> so that means we have to turn the whole browser into a worse implementation of flash

[09:31:22] <feep[work]> I assumed that was a stupid op fan
[09:31:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> It actually comes with two mount points for 40mm fans
[09:31:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> In case you install, say, a PCI graphics card or something
[09:31:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> And need additional cooling for it
[09:31:49] <feep[work]> I mean, yeah, right? I assumed it was fans already
[09:32:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> Nope, by default there were no fans there and also no cards in those slots
[09:32:09] <feep[work]> lol ok
[09:32:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway yeah, Apple gave some serious thought to their case designs in those days

[10:03:14] <feep[work]> I used to have a shiny orange laptop <3
[10:03:44] <feep[work]> on reflection, I've had a lot of laptops.
[10:03:51] <feep[work]> like ... four, I think?
[10:03:58] <quanticle> ... only?
[10:04:21] <feep[work]> well, my uni laptop, my first gaming laptop, my adorable tiny netbook, and my current lenovo
[10:05:01] <feep[work]> which, 3+ years in, is still fucking amazing, god damn, expensive thinkpads are the shit
[10:06:32] <quanticle> They truly are. My previous Thinkpad lasted for about six years. It would still be going today, if I hadn't accidentally dropped it, which caused half the LEDs to fail, creating a "stage-light" effect.
[10:07:16] <feep[work]> haha
[10:07:20] <feep[work]> also my condolences tho
[10:09:13] <quanticle> Yeah, I was really mad at myself for that. There was somewhat of a good ending, though. I ended up basically giving that laptop to a friend who is better at fine electronics than I. He was able to replace the screen, and now it's serving as a Netflix/Youtube box for his kids.
[10:09:46] <feep[work]> good end.
[10:10:16] <feep[work]> srsly, usually with 2000€ purchases I am like "did I really need this" and "this was kind of wasteful, wasn't it"
[10:10:34] <feep[work]> with my thinkpad I'm *frequently* like "damn, splurging on this laptop was a *good* choice."
[10:11:33] <quanticle> Really? For me, that's in the $50-$200 range. By the time we get into the $500+ range, I'm in serious research mode, and I know exactly what I need, exactly what I'm buying and how the two match (or don't).

[10:25:16] <PapuaHardyNet> you use that escooter to commute to and from work?

[10:29:28] <Robomot> Creating a truly formidable Art - LessWrong 2.0 viewer [FinalFormal 14 Oct 2021 18:43 UTC 1 pointI’m just a third in …] (Over this last week, I and several other folk from CFAR's past gathered. We were doing a kind of post-mortem on the last decade. I mostly haven't thought explicitly about Less Wrong style rationality for the last three years. …)
[10:30:07] <quanticle> It turns out that some people *need* religion, and some people don't
[10:30:17] <feep[work]> sounds right
[10:30:31] <quanticle> And the former, I think, vastly outnumber the latter
[10:30:46] <quanticle> And Eliezer's greatest mistake was in not realizing this
[10:30:55] <quanticle> s/in//
[10:31:42] <feep[work]> okay but hang on, because I sort of understand the religion thing, I think you *can* make truth a religion
[10:31:51] <feep[work]> there's something transcendental in the "magical click" experience
[10:32:44] <feep[work]> it's just a matter of pointing at the moon
[10:33:28] <feep[work]> like, I think focusing on the feeling that truth evokes in you risks decoupling that feeling from the thing it tries to filter on, and I think that's what you're complaining about
[10:33:29] <quanticle> There isn't enough truth to build a religion on. The people I'm speaking about need to feel an emotional connection with the world. They want to love a world that is incapable of loving them back.
[10:33:51] <feep[work]> that only makes it more attractive though
[10:34:40] <feep[work]> I mean, I don't think it's correct to say "eliezer did not realize this"; I think eliezer *has* this "religious attachment to truth"
[10:34:40] <quanticle> Uh... elaborate?
[10:35:03] <feep[work]> like, love is all about ... agh, sorry I can't put this into words
[10:35:13] <feep[work]> there's an image, or an abstract concept, of person A looking at person B looking at thing X
[10:35:34] <feep[work]> you can absolutely love things or even people that don't care about you
[10:35:53] <feep[work]> especially if you're feeling insecure
[10:36:10] <feep[work]> like, the very act of caring about you can make person B seem *less* worthy of worship
[10:37:18] <feep[work]> if the world loved me, wouldn't that be really creepy?
[10:37:41] <feep[work]> I prefer the world to do things like exert 10m/s² of gravity and absorb solar radiation
[10:38:00] <feep[work]> those are good things for a world to be doing
[10:38:43] <feep[work]> quanticle: anyway, in summary, "jesus loves you" was a mistake
[10:39:14] <feep[work]> (obligatorily: "well yeah, that's why we had to kill him")
[10:39:38] <feep[work]> quanticle: it's like, uh, uriel from unsong?
[10:39:58] <feep[work]> like, if you think people in this community cannot love uriel like fucking mad
[10:40:33] <quanticle> My objection is that, if your concern is forming correct beliefs about the world, leaning into the emotional connection aspect seems like a blind alley at best, and actively counterproductive at worst. I'll cite the two "pressure tests" that Valentine talks about in his post: "In one story of Eliezer's fictional Beistsukai, the students received a challenge to invent quantum gravity in one
[10:40:35] <quanticle> month. Years ago, when I ran rationality dojos, I once issued a challenge of roughly this type. I warned them ahead of time to prepare, and gave them some general parameters, but wouldn't tell them what the challenge was beforehand. When they arrived, I handed them a paper describing the challenge: 'You will have one hour to sustainably 80/20 boost the expected vitality of every attendee of
[10:40:37] <quanticle> tonight's session.'" 
[10:41:05] <feep[work]> did it work?
[10:41:12] <quanticle> There's a huge difference between those two tasks, and only one of them leads to rationality!
[10:41:31] <feep[work]> eh, I kinda disagree
[10:41:45] <feep[work]> I don't think the difference is one of kind
[10:42:11] *** Quits: _inky (~inky_@46.36.116.141) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[10:42:44] <feep[work]> quanticle: anyway, my argument is that you can form an emotional attachment to *the state of having correct beliefs about the world*.
[10:42:50] <feep[work]> it's not even hard.
[10:43:26] <feep[work]> like, one of the primary things I love about rationalists is their ability to be corrected when in an incorrect state of belief
[10:43:43] <feep[work]> you don't know how fucking amazing that is unless you spend time around people who don't have it, and I mean purely on an emotional level
[10:43:44] <quanticle> A sufficiently high difference in degree is a difference in kind. It's difficult to tell if one has a valid theory of quantum gravity, but I posit that it's far more difficult to tell if one has a method to 'increase the vitality' of a broad group of people. At some point, it becomes impossible to distinguish progress from charlatanism, and when you ask a question where it's impossible to verify
[10:43:46] <quanticle> if the answer is correct, then you have regressed on the path to rationality.
[10:43:57] <feep[work]> there are whole categories of tragedies that are simply excluded, or made vanishingly less likely, in the presence of that skill
[10:44:20] <feep[work]> quanticle: right, it's a badly specified question and it has incentive problems
[10:44:32] <feep[work]> I'm not saying it's a good task.
[10:44:58] <feep[work]> I don't think anyone who knows about the AI box experiments would or should have posed it.
[10:45:22] <saturn2> vitality: ☑️ BOOSTED
[10:45:46] <feep[work]> but I don't think it's a different *kind* of task; all high pressure tasks have incentive risks, I mean, that's one way to get UFAI
[10:49:51] <nshepperd2> quanticle: oh, that's easy. kill 20% of the attendees and redistribute their money to the other 80%
[10:49:59] <nshepperd2> vitality boosted
[10:50:21] <feep[work]> "I'VE NEVER FELT SO ALIVE! HA HA HA HA HA"
[10:51:01] <quanticle> I'm not even thinking about incentives in an interpersonal or principal/agent sense. I'm saying that it's easy to fool yourself. If you have a proposed theory of quantum gravity, you can at least propose some experiments to test it (unless you're a string theorist), and you can say, "Well, we might not know whether this theory is correct *right now*, but at least we have a way to determine if it
[10:51:03] <quanticle> is at some point in the future, when we get funding." For the vitality question, how do you even start with that? What the fuck is "vitality", anyway?
[10:51:24] <feep[work]> I mean, it's a manipulation task, right?
[10:51:40] <feep[work]> the goal is to make the other task members report that their "vitality" is higher, which is not a node attached to anything consistent
[10:52:32] <feep[work]> even if it was, you wouldn't want to permaraise it cause whatever that thing was where people's happiness returns to a medium
[10:52:37] <quanticle> If someone asked me to raise a bunch of people's vitality, I'd have them all stand, feet shoulder-width apart, knees slightly bent and scream real hard.
[10:52:41] <quanticle> Seems to work for Goku
[10:52:43] <quanticle> Vegeta
[10:52:45] <quanticle> Gohan
[10:52:46] <feep[work]> that might genuinely work
[10:52:47] <quanticle> Etc
[10:54:20] <PapuaHardyNet> Vitality points mate, just distribute them after making them level up
[10:54:23] <quanticle> I mean, you may as well ask me to increase the amount of luminiferous aether or phlogiston that people emit
[10:54:30] <PapuaHardyNet> the real question is how do you help people level up
[10:55:01] <feep[work]> quanticle: I mean, it just sounds like the first thing you should do is go around and find out how people in the group define vitality
[10:55:17] <feep[work]> treat it as you're an ai and someone just gave you that task
[10:56:26] <quanticle> I mean, the AI approach to it would be to find some random vaguely correlated metric that people self-report as being related to "vitality" and Goodhart the everloving shit out of it
[10:56:32] <feep[work]> yep
[10:56:33] <feep[work]> do that
[10:57:14] <quanticle> Lol, I have an answer, but you're not going to like it
[10:57:27] <quanticle> "Literally, all of you, drop whatever it is you're doing, and apply to Google"
[10:57:47] <feep[work]> I mean
[10:57:49] <feep[work]> will that work?
[10:57:59] <quanticle> Money is loosely correlated, and Google pays a lot
[10:58:04] <PapuaHardyNet> that would reduce my vitality in the short term, and probably in the long term too
[10:58:30] <PapuaHardyNet> honestly, I think lsusr meant "physiological activeness and well-being" when he meant vitality
[10:58:46] <quanticle> Google has free gyms!
[10:59:04] <quanticle> Checkmate Papuatheist!
[11:00:36] <kuudes> hmm. bind 20% to findom of 80%?
[11:00:47] <kuudes> less lethal than killing them, and might produce more
[11:01:30] <quanticle> Oh, and correction, that was Valentine, not lsusr
[11:01:42] <quanticle> (Though, I do find the confusion understandable)
[11:10:11] <quanticle> Anyway, thanks for the discussion, feep. My vitality has certainly been boosted as a result.

[11:47:46] <quanticle> "So this is eggwhite powder, yes?" "Yes." "What's it made of?" "The eggwhite powder?" "Yes, what is the eggwhite powder made of?" "Whey, of course"
[11:47:51] <feep[work]> XD
[11:48:32] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: like, normally you say 1 EL gestrichen, ie. 1 tbsp flat, meaning up to the line of the spoon
[11:48:35] <feep[work]> edge*
[11:48:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> Right but this is in grams
[11:48:50] <feep[work]> so 3g gestrichen is nonsense
[11:49:27] * Obormot\Arcturus shrug
[11:49:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> I think someone just got confused transcribing this
[11:49:55] <feep[work]> well it isn't any better at the floor
[11:49:59] <feep[work]> half a spoon flat
[11:50:09] <feep[work]> like what, flatten it, then scrape half off?
[11:50:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well
[11:50:18] <feep[work]> I mean I guess??

[11:52:54] <feep[work]> I want all cooking to be done by vague approximations.
[11:53:26] <quanticle> You're like my mom
[11:53:42] <quanticle> "How much salt should I add?" "I dunno, pour for about 5 seconds"
[11:53:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep[work]: We're talking about baking, though. Baking's gotta be precise
[11:53:53] <saturn2> in the old days i guess you had to carefully empty your teaspoon onto each side of a balance scale a little at a time to get a half teaspoon. and then repeat the process for 1/4 teaspoon
[11:53:56] <quanticle> "Wait stop"
[11:54:30] <feep[work]> quanticle: yeah that sounds about correct
[11:54:32] <feep[work]> saltwise
[11:54:43] <feep[work]> maybe slightly oversalted
[11:54:56] <feep[work]> I'd be happier with two, three seconds to start maybe
[11:55:02] <quanticle> Obormot\Arcturus: You think baking has to be precise. My mom baked banana bread in that fashion.
[11:55:13] <quanticle> feep[work]: This was a dish being cooked for a party of like 8
[11:55:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> Banana bread is precisely one of the least-precise-requiring things
[11:55:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> Quickbreads generally tend to be
[11:55:26] <feep[work]> quanticle: okay yeah, then 5 is fine
[11:56:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> Basically, a quickbread is "a mush consisting of flour and ummm stuff, plus baking powder"
[11:56:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> The baking powder provides the rise, the flour provides the structure, and the rest is just... adjustments to texture/flavor
[11:57:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's gonna come out a quickbread almost no matter what you do with it, as long as it's in the general vicinity of correct
[11:58:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: btw here's a weird question... have you, by chance, noticed your mom using less salt in food than, say, when you were younger
[12:00:53] <quanticle> Yes, but in my case it's deliberate. After my dad recovered from cancer, our diet changed a lot. Besides the expected change (i.e. he's diabetic now, now much less sugar and fewer carbs in general), she also uses less oil, because my dad, for a while, was having issues with stomach ulcers, and the doctors advised a reduction in oils and fats. Less salt is just kind of part and parcel of that.
[12:01:19] <quanticle> s/now, now/now,/
[12:01:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hmm, ok that's uninformative then

[12:09:47] <kuudes> yolk is keltuainen, ie yellow-substance
[12:12:02] <rsaarelm> Old-timey protein word is valkuaisaine, eggwhite is valkuainen.
[12:12:11] <rsaarelm> Nowadays people just say proteiini.
[12:15:48] <rsaarelm> Ah, looks like there was an even more old-timey thing where you just said valkuainen instead of valkuaisaine. I always thought valkuainen was just eggwhite.
[12:20:18] <kuudes> indeed. we try to make actual finnish words also for technical and scientific terms
[12:20:58] <kuudes> hence "kääntäjä" (translator) instead of compiler

[12:40:05] <feep[work]> .. oh, google correction: "foldable computer"
[12:40:59] <feep[work]> compiler has absolutely no german equivalent tho.
[12:41:57] <kuudes> yes, it is "taskulaskin" ie "pocket-counter" in finnish as well
[12:42:19] <kuudes> logarithm stick was laskutikku, counting-stick
[12:43:24] <kuudes> laptop was tried to be pushed to "sylimikro" ie lap-microcomputer, but I guess as they are not supposed to actually be used on your lap anymore, it is just "läppäri" ie a diminutative of the english word

Waymo said this is a result of the San Francisco Slow Streets program that was introduced around the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. San Francisco Mayor London Breed announced the program in April 2020 to limit through traffic on certain residential streets and allow them to be used as a shared space for people
[19:31:20] <feepbot> traveling by foot and by bicycle. Initially, Slow Streets were introduced on 4.5 miles of San Francisco streets. However, that was quickly increased to about 20 miles by mid-May and now about 45 miles a year later. The program could become permanent. One area in which these Waymo vehicles are operating falls under this Slow Streets program. All vehicles, either human-driven or
[19:31:20] <feepbot> autonomous, traveling northbound on 15th Ave have to make a u-turn at some point. There’s no other way to exit that block. There are barriers that prohibit through traffic on Lake St East and west of 15th Ave, and signage/barriers that prohibit northbound through traffic on 15th Ave. Here’s the statement from Waymo: “We continually adjust to dynamic San Francisco road rules.
[19:31:25] <feepbot> In this case, cars traveling north of California on 15th Ave have to take a u-turn due to the presence of Slow Streets signage on Lake. So, the Waymo Driver was obeying the same road rules that any car is required to follow.”' https://www.therobotreport.com/waymo-self-driving-cars-kee-turning-around-dead-end-sf/

[20:23:25] <ggreer> you have to press the gas to go through a green light if there's no car ahead. also you have to press the gas to tell autopilot to continue after the light changes from red to green

[21:28:41] <feepbot> Flynn’s prayer included invocations to “sevenfold rays” and “legions,” two phrases that struck some of Flynn’s followers as strange. “We are your instrument of those sevenfold rays and all your archangels, all of them,” Flynn said, later adding, “We will be the instrument of your will, whatever it is. In your name, and in the name of your legions, we are freeborn,
[21:28:41] <feepbot> and we shall remain freeborn, and we shall not be enslaved by any foe.” As video of the prayer circulated in online conspiracy theorist groups, the references to “legions” and “rays” soon sparked speculation among Flynn’s right-wing supporters that their hero had been lured to the dark side. Always on the lookout for the Satanic influence they imagine lurks at the heart
[21:28:46] <feepbot> of the world, they claimed that Flynn had secretly been worshiping the devil. Worse, since the congregation was repeating the prayer after Flynn, the rumor went, he had duped hundreds of Christians into joining the ritual. “A lot of people in the Christian world believe that when you pray to rays of light and legions that you’re praying to the devil,” Oebel, the YouTube host,
