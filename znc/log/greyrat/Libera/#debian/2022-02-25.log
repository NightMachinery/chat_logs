[05:09:10] <zumba_addict77> Hi folks, I'm on Debian 10. When I reboot my machine, the static ip address I put in interfaces file works. However, when there is a network outage such as when xfinity fails and I had to reboot the router, my ip address changes. Running `systemctl restart networking` still grabs a different ip until I reboot it. Why is it like this?
[05:09:24] <zumba_addict77> This is the second time it happened
[05:10:25] <greycat> The *router's* external IP address has nothing to do with your *internal* Debian machine's IP address, right?
[05:10:38] <zumba_addict77> no, i'm using 192.168.1.x
[05:10:56] <somiaj> could you have multiple tools managing your network? So when your network goes down, something detects than then brings it backup with dhcp?
[05:11:04] <zumba_addict77> that's possible
[05:11:15] <zumba_addict77> i'll check dhcp since I have not checked it yhet
[05:11:16] <somiaj> also don't use systemctl restart networking, instead if use 'ifdown interface' followed by 'ifup interface' to bring the interface up and down
[05:11:18] <greycat> 192.168 is an internal LAN address space, not routable on the public Internet.  You can do whatever you want on your internal network.
[05:11:27] *** Joins: vaio (~gary@user/ghost)
[05:11:32] <zumba_addict77> ok, i'll try ifdown then i'll rejoin

[05:14:02] <zumba_addict77> awesome!
[05:14:11] <zumba_addict77> why is networking systemd not good?
[05:14:36] <zumba_addict77> xfce
[05:14:37] <greycat> I believe somiaj is attempting to discover *which* network management tool(s) you're using.
[05:14:38] <somiaj> I don't follow. Networkd works just fine, but debian's interfaces file is not networkd.

[05:14:53] <zumba_addict77> got it
[05:15:14] <zumba_addict77> do you want me to open something?
[05:15:34] <somiaj> zumba_addict77: the netwroking interface is kinda a vague term. And what does it mean to restart networking, what about firewalls, etc. The service is designed to run at bootup to bring the netwrok up, but isn't designed to restart the service on the fly. Once you are up use the network tools ti bring up/down interfaces.
[05:15:38] <zumba_addict77> I see Advanced Network COnfigfuration
[05:15:41] <somiaj> arg networking service
[05:15:49] <zumba_addict77> gotcha
[05:16:15] <greycat> I'm still not clear *which* IP address changed, from what to what.
[05:16:22] <zumba_addict77> oh
[05:16:37] <zumba_addict77> the ip address of the nic on my debian machine
[05:16:50] <somiaj> But debian's interfaces file is not a service that runs, it brings the interfaces up at boot and can be controlled with ifup/down. If your network is changing automatically, you have some other tool paying attention to your network and acting accordingly when it detected your router whent down.
[05:16:51] <zumba_addict77> which is why i mentioned interfaces file
[05:17:03] <zumba_addict77> got it
[05:17:10] <greycat> Your ISP dropping out should NOT have any effect on your internal networking.
[05:17:15] <zumba_addict77> I thought that networking service will take care of it. I was wrong
[05:17:30] <zumba_addict77> exactly which was so weird
[05:17:40] <zumba_addict77> every time I turned off the router, that happens
[05:18:00] <zumba_addict77> and i don't have any other dhcp server here
[05:18:02] <greycat> That's why somiaj was wondering whether you accidentally configured something to act as a DHCP client.
[05:18:15] <zumba_addict77> got it
[05:18:27] <zumba_addict77> ps ax|grep dhcp?
[05:18:48] <greycat> ... can't hurt, but a negative result is not 100% conclusive
[05:18:59] <zumba_addict77> i just see this `0:54 /usr/sbin/dnsmasq --conf-file=/var/lib/libvirt/dnsmasq/default.conf --leasefile-ro --dhcp-script=/usr/lib/libvirt/libvirt_leaseshelper`
[05:19:24] <greycat> well, that's a positive result, but I don't know dnsmasq
[05:19:25] *** Parts: idego (~idego@user/idego) ()
[05:21:20] <somiaj> dnsmasq is being used to masq your internal virtual network for your vms with your outside network
[05:21:32] <somiaj> That shouldn't be changing your ip address on your hosts interface.
[05:21:41] <zumba_addict77> yep, it shouldn't
[05:22:24] <zumba_addict77> and it's weird it's always that ip address, lol
[05:22:47] <zumba_addict77> i'll check the router's cached mac address
[05:22:50] <greycat> What is the new IP address that you get?  Is it 169.something?
[05:23:13] <zumba_addict77> 192.168.1.107 is in the interfaces. Then new ip address is 192.168.1.231
[05:23:29] <somiaj> do you have connman or network manager running?
[05:23:30] <zumba_addict77> it seems like there is a dhcp server
[05:23:45] <zumba_addict77> maybe, how do i check?
[05:23:47] <greycat> If you get it from DHCP it should be visible in several different logs.
[05:24:04] <zumba_addict77> i'll check the router dhcp serttings
[05:24:13] <somiaj> that is most likely your router's dhcp server, but as to why your machine is requesting a new one, you'll have to check through the logs to see what is actually doing this. To me it seems you have multiple tools trying to manage your network.
[05:24:47] <somiaj> well we aren't suggesting you check the router, but that is one way to fix this issue, just make your router give this macaddress the ip you want, though you won't track down what is running and causing your ip to reset when network connectivity goes down.

[05:28:27] <zumba_addict77> but why is it doing that
[05:28:32] <greycat> If that's your correct interface name (enp6s0) then that looks fine.
[05:28:43] <zumba_addict77> yes, it's the correct interface
[05:29:00] <zumba_addict77> look at this `Feb 24 19:26:48 sdr dhclient[20403]: DHCPRELEASE of 192.168.1.231 on enp6s0 to 192.168.1.1 port 67`
[05:29:02] <somiaj> paste the relvenat part of the log as well?
[05:29:12] <zumba_addict77> that's the proof dhclient did it
[05:29:27] <somiaj> dhclient is being run by some other application, network manager, networkd, connman are the main culprits.

[05:30:46] <zumba_addict77> awesome guys
[05:31:07] <somiaj> network amanger should be ignoring interfaces in the interfaces file, so you must have done some configuration to change that behavior

[05:32:31] <somiaj> yea, xfce uses network manager, now use xfce to dig though its configuration files and tell it to ignore the interface.

[13:58:47] <Khepra> Awaru: as a last test, you can do this:       echo "awaru:YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE" | chpasswd           that way you can see with your own eyes the characters that go in the password, and verify it's correct. and that also sets the pass for "awaru" user

[13:58:54] <dpkg> dpkg is probably the program used by Debian to install and remove packages, "man dpkg".  Also ask me about <reference>.  The main info bot in #debian is also called dpkg; ask me about <dpkgbot>.

[13:59:08] <dpkg> Please visit http://wiki.debian.org/IRC/DpkgBot to learn how to effectively search the factoids database for FAQ, and not flood in the channel with !tell <who> about <what>.  Also ask me about <msg the bot>.  We ask that you learn to search for yourself first, unless it is a specific problem.  Many questions are asked repeatedly, and the factoid database can be of great help to you.  Ask me about <search dpkg>.

[14:02:57] <Haohmaru> Khe-pra
[14:02:57] <godSend23> right so maybe any channel i go to, i can just talk to a the designated bot first?
[14:03:10] <godSend23> to see if i can get my answer then
[14:03:25] <Khepra> what are you even looking for?
[14:03:27] <Haohmaru> not every channel has bots
[14:03:42] <Khepra> and not all bots are the same software/commands/level-of-helpful
[14:03:51] <Haohmaru> yeah
[14:04:02] <Awaru> Khepra, none of those was used in the pw
[14:04:10] <godSend23> Khepra, don't u remeber what u told me a while back
[14:04:11] <Awaru> none of anything that is different in different keyboard layouts
[14:04:21] <godSend23> i'm just beginning to realize the power of the bot'
[14:04:28] <Khepra> Awaru: alright. but with that chpasswd you're 100% sure setting the correct one, so it cannot fail unless you have hidden configs that aren't obvious
[14:04:40] <godSend23> and stop wasting others's time if the bot can tell me
[14:04:55] <Khepra> godSend23: no. I am AI. my memory banks are purged every morning because I'm still experimental.
[14:07:32] <godSend23> this is so interesting to me now
[14:08:03] <Haohmaru> you must be new to IRC ;P~
[14:09:08] <godSend23> i'm not; it's just i never had a chance to fully utilize a bot
[14:09:33] <Khepra> godSend23: you can also use this: https://ircbots.debian.net/factoids/
[14:09:39] <godSend23> on the wiki u linked to, i don't see the 'query' cmd
[14:09:55] <godSend23> i want to talk to it like im directly dm someone w/ questions
[14:10:16] <Khepra> it's a simple bot, tho. but with giant sASS.
[14:10:16] <Haohmaru> godSend23 /query is usually a *client* thing, it tells your client to open up a private window to chat to another user
[14:10:18] <godSend23> ty Khepra for this link
[14:10:20] <Khepra> dpkg aren't you?
[14:10:21] <dpkg> Khepra: I don't know, could you explain it?
[14:10:25] <Haohmaru> so not all clients might have it (most should)
[14:11:03] <Haohmaru> when you write in that window, your client then does the "/msg <user> <your text goes here>" for you
[14:11:13] <Awaru> ok after reinstalling debian the absolutely same problem
[14:11:31] <Khepra> Awaru: did you try that chpass command?
[14:11:52] <Khepra> or let me ask, how are you setting the password for user "awaru".
[14:12:18] <godSend23> yes Haohmaru, it did. I think /query is the same as /msg?
[14:15:17] <Haohmaru> not quite
[14:15:35] <Haohmaru> but it depends on the IRC client you use
[14:15:36] <Awaru> this is really a joke
[14:15:41] <Awaru> Khepra, with passwd
[14:15:56] <Awaru> but i dont think it doesntmatter cant connect with root either
[14:16:02] <godSend23> hmmm ok
[14:16:05] <Khepra> Awaru: you can't connect as root, it's disabled
[14:16:08] <godSend23> "<godSend23> which iso doesn't require internet
[14:16:08] <godSend23> <dpkg> are you smoking crack?"
[14:16:28] <godSend23> did i type a wrong ques?
[14:16:34] <Khepra> Awaru: at this point, can you verify that putty is actually not scrambling your keyboard layout?   can you type your password where it asks for username, and confirm the characters are correct?
[14:16:35] <Haohmaru> godSend23 hold on, dpkg isn't some "AI" like wolfram alpha
[14:16:43] <Haohmaru> you can't just literally "talk" to it
[14:16:49] <godSend23> u said talk to it
[14:16:50] <godSend23> earlier
[14:16:53] <Haohmaru> it responds to a bunch of commands
[14:16:58] <Khepra> and a lot of SASD
[14:17:01] <Khepra> *sass
[14:17:27] <godSend23> who designed this bot and would u guys say it's smarter than other gen bots of other channels?
[14:17:38] <Haohmaru> godSend23 i meant "talk to it (your commands) in a private window, so that you don't have to use /msg dpkg <commands>
[14:18:08] <Khepra> godSend23: it's an "infobot"   http://www.infobot.org/guide-0.43.x.html
[14:18:17] <godSend23> i'm not new to IRC but I am new to deb so idk any commands
[14:18:25] <godSend23> :/

[16:44:01] <jelly> !debootstrap
[16:44:01] <dpkg> debootstrap can create a basic Debian system from scratch, without apt/dpkg.  Useful for installing in a <chroot>. It is key to installing Debian GNU/Linux from a Unix/Linux system. http://wiki.debian.org/Debootstrap - https://www.debian.org/releases/bullseye/amd64/apds03.en.html
[16:44:05] <jelly> !schroot
[16:44:05] <dpkg> schroot is an easy way of setting up a <chroot> in a way that can be treated as a session. If desired, modification to the chroot can be prevented using overlayfs or LVM snapshots, making it very convenient for building packages or simply running packages from other releases with minimal containment. See https://wiki.debian.org/Schroot and http://linuxgazette.net/150/kapil.html

[21:12:49] <somiaj> is this an lxc container or the host?
[21:13:04] <potatosal> it's an lxc container
[21:13:44] <somiaj> I don't know lxc, but could it be something with how containers work, maybe lxc is overwriting this file from the outside?

[22:22:41] <somiaj> potatosal: By default debian doesn't have a firewall, but you can install various tools to control this. The iptables method was iptables-persistent which provides scripts to save/load rules. Though as mentioned, if you have the time switching to nftables vs using the wrapper is prefered.
[22:23:17] <somiaj> antto: I would at this point focus on just turning this off vs trying to figure out how it turned on. What you describe isn't default (and you are the first person I have seen mention this here)

[23:58:32] <Awaru> thats all
[23:58:35] <Awaru> its /home/awaru
[23:58:38] <greycat> ls -ld . testfile
[23:58:45] *** Joins: ty3r0x (~ty3r0x@user/ty3r0x)
[23:58:57] <Awaru> testfile doesnt exist
[23:59:00] <Khepra> who owns the directory?
[23:59:03] <greycat> then just ls -ld .
[23:59:05] <Awaru> touch is a command to create a new empty file
[23:59:08] <greycat> then just ls -ld .
[23:59:33] <Awaru> wouldnt it be more smarter to just change the permissions to the folder or..?
[23:59:59] <greycat> This is my last attempt to be civil here.  Run "ls -ld ." so we can SEE the owner and permissions.
