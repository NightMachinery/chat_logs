[00:03:17] <WormFood> hhhmmm....well, it does seem to have worked for me, but after I had to give it a --fix-broken option
[00:03:49] <tjcarter> then there was some reason why the package could not be installed
[00:04:05] <tjcarter> you might want to look at what it had to remove to install it
[00:04:17] <WormFood> It didn't remove anything
[00:05:13] <WormFood> It said the package is "not fully installed or removed"

[00:05:38] <tjcarter> at least, not exclusively
[00:05:58] <tjcarter> actually not at all, since apt install would probably refuse if it couldn't resolve dependencies

[00:39:35] <WormFood> tjcarter, legally safe?
[00:40:05] <sney> deb-multimedia is typically safe for (1) package, the issue is just when you leave it enabled and accidentally pull in other dependencies from there
[00:40:12] <sney> apt can't differentiate it as a separate source
[00:40:35] <tjcarter> WormFood: not legally safe, some of that stuff is difficult to impossible to make legally "safe". But at least safe from a system integrity standpoint.

[00:40:38] <sney> licenses depend on the package, ymmv, read it

[00:41:37] <sney> tjcarter: yep, but then some other package in debian main might depend on 'libfoo' and if the newest libfoo is in deb-multimedia, that's the one you get, along with any surprise customizations
[00:41:42] <n4dir> in general, if i add third-party repos or apps, i expect something like "it might go south"
[00:41:47] <tjcarter> sney: right
[00:42:02] <sney> so enable it, install what you need, disable it
[00:42:08] <WormFood> Is that a real audio formwat, or did you just make that up? (I'm afraid you're serious)
[00:42:13] <tjcarter> which is why the right way to do a deb-multimedia repo would be to have dmo-ffmpeg and friends which live in /opt/dmo/

[03:07:51] <sney> you can't install rocm-dev because it depends on libgcc-7-dev and libpython3.8, which are not in bullseye.
[03:08:29] *** Joins: i0e (~is0ke3@user/is0ke3)
[03:08:36] <sney> anything else is marginal until you either a) find a version of rocm with updated gcc and python dependencies, or 2) provide those versions of libgcc and python on your system.
[03:08:47] <anon> "you may need to create dummy packages because the names of some libstdc++ packages etc unfortunately contain the version number. The later versions, in my experience, are compatible so you just may need to 'hack' the dependency names."
[03:09:18] <anon> Which doesn't account for libpython, unfortunately
[03:09:22] <sney> dummy packages might convince dpkg to install the package, but that only solves it until it's time to actually build the dkms module.

[05:47:05] <willow> here's a script i created to force LibreOffice to use the GTK Adwaita theme.  LibreOffice has a tendency to look horrible if you're using a 'dark' mode.  This forces it to look 'regular'.  http://paste.debian.net/1212916/

[05:52:45] <willow> except now i realize that LibreOffice 7.2 is ignoring 'GTK_THEME=Adwaita' üòû     it worked prior to 7.2
[05:54:44] <sney> iirc for gtk3 there is a :dark attribute that can be specified in the GTK_THEME variable, which may help, maybe your DE or something else isn't detecting that dark mode is preferred

[12:25:37] <n4dir_> Khepra: now, i am not in such. But the arch wiki regarding homed makes me think: i see no reason why you couldn't switch back and forth between both "ways". As said: not my thing, but perhaps you want to look at that site.

[12:27:39] <Khepra> well, homed assumes completely new paradigm on userdb and that part _could_ (I don't know if it is) be intrusive to normally handled system user accounts. arch is few steps deeper into systemd than debian, there's no GR that permits support of alt inits, and no part of arch ecosystem even tries to. debian at least does, that's why -- I suppose -- oomd is separate, as it doesn't depend on systemd

[13:15:12] <Khepra> "latest kernel" might not be adequate. depends on what software, esp. dkms, you need to build against it
[13:15:54] <Khepra> that's why I'm backporting stuff from 5.11+, I need zfs, where default package in bullseye only supports up to 5.10, so I patch 5.10 for some amdgpu stuff from newer kernels

[14:02:11] <Khepra> hiya: your question is loaded. I have no idea what you need for "better intel graphics". maybe it's just firmware. maybe it's both. maybe it's custom patches. BUT if you want to use backported kernel, you need to enable bullseye-backports and then install just the package you want from backports. eg.   apt install -t bullseye-backports linux-image-amd64 linux-headers-amd64

[14:03:02] <Khepra> !bullseye-backports
[14:03:02] <dpkg> Some packages intended for Bookworm (which will be Debian 12) but recompiled for use with Bullseye (Debian 11) can be found in the bullseye-backports repository. See https://backports.debian.org/Instructions/ . Ask me about <bdo>, <backports>.
[14:07:20] <hiya> Khepra: ok thanks I know how to get it from backports, wondering if mesa something is required
[14:07:42] <hiya> hey https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/intel-media-va-driver is needed to enabled hardware based acceleration in Firefox on debian?
[14:08:07] <Khepra> hiya: fwiw, for my amdgpu, things I thought would be solved by kernel and firmware (visual glitches) were not, but mesa upgrade fixed it.
[14:09:00] <Khepra> what's even better, I no longer seem to need newer mesa because I switched to wayland/sway, which is confusing even further

[14:50:04] <willow> i would try from the debian development source first since configuring a pristine kernel is pretty complex
[14:50:22] <Khepra> alternatively, the upstream tarballs already have the targets for debian packaging, so it's just a matter of copying .config, running bindeb-pkg target, and apt installing resulting debs
[14:50:33] <hiya> willow: will wait for backports
[14:50:34] <Khepra> it's not that complex
[14:50:50] <Khepra> you start with existing debian configs, and then follow prompts of the "oldconfig" target
[14:51:20] <hiya> debian isnt configured to use hardware for video accelerations

[14:52:02] <Khepra> the only complex thing is if you want signed kernel, then it's a bit more involved; alternatively just remove CONFIG_SYSTEM_TRUSTED_KEYS
[14:52:32] <willow> Khepra: is the Debian .config included in the source or do you copy it from somewhere?

[14:53:13] <Khepra> hiya: what do you mean? acceleration works fine for firefox and my amdgpu, no tricks needed
[14:53:15] <willow> it won't choke if you use a .config from an older version?
[14:53:42] <Khepra> willow: no. you DO have to run the "oldconfig" target so you bring it up to latest version, with new items

So it will be after two things happen (1) the current ESR is no longer supported by mozilla, and (2) the current version in Debian has serious enough security issues to need a security fix.

[21:34:40] <somiaj> obiwahn: the Debian way has evolved, and really just means, 'build a .deb for the kernel'. The modern upstream kernel source has a 'make deb-pkg' or 'make bindeb-pkg' (binary only) already, so need for a tool like kernel-package anymore.
[21:35:03] <obiwahn> wow that is nice!

[21:37:42] <somiaj> the debian handbook has a chapter that covers this. There are other options using the source provided by debian, but upstream source can build decent .debs these days
[21:37:58] <obiwahn> Do you happen to know what I need to do to allow for more debugging?
[21:38:47] <obiwahn> I have trouble with my amdgpu and I have the feeling that I need at least help a bit.
[21:38:49] <somiaj> obiwahn: debugging in what sense?
[21:39:10] <somiaj> If you want to be able to parse core dumps with gdb, you'll need to install the debugging symbols package.
[21:39:25] <somiaj> but lots of debugging can be done just by looking at dmesg output
[21:39:37] <obiwahn> i have never done kernel development so i am not sure I would try to make dmesg even more verbose

[23:34:29] <anon16_> Hey, just curious, does debian start services on installation?
[23:34:46] <greycat> 99% of the time, yes.  This is part of the policy.
[23:34:59] <anon16_> Hmm, that sounds bad. Any way to disable this?
[23:36:49] <obiwahn> that it starts the services?
[23:37:01] <obiwahn> or to disable the services later for good?
[23:37:33] <obiwahn> Starting is not that bad as most services are bound to localhost only in their default configuration.
[23:37:46] <anon16_> Yeah, I'd like to configure the services before starting them, ideally
[23:37:48] <greycat> If you could state a *specific* reason you think it "sounds bad" and a *specific* service you want to pre-emptively sabotage, we might be able to advise.
