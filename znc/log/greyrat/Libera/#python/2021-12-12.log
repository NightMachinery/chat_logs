[06:13:11] <grym> backprop is how you do error correction during training

[10:49:35] <jinsun> so yeah maybe we can say that when length cannot be determined, it should not conisder any overload that allows only some some length and not others
[10:49:51] <jinsun> and go for the one that allows arbitrary length
[10:51:12] <jinsun> but it would start complaining on oter functions that don't allow arbitrary length then, so maybe he'll not be convinced

[15:49:52] <kek_> hi
[15:49:55] <nedbat> teut: check the last rows also
[15:50:13] <hexnewbie> Converting my LaTeX preprocessing scripts with 2to3 I find curious behaviour I've been relying on: [Article(f) for f in it] in global context, and Article has def __init__(filename), but accidentally used open(f) instead. In Python 2.x that *worked*, LOL
[15:50:22] <teut> yes I saw the last ones only
[15:50:51] <bjs> teut: remember you can ask Python to print just a little bit to check, like `print(grid[-5:])` to print the last rows, or `print(grid[10:15])` to check some rows in the middle
[15:50:52] <bjs> etc
[15:51:07] <hexnewbie> I stared at it for several minutes trying to figure how 2to3 broke my script and caused my variable to be misspelled, because it didn't make any sense for it to work
[15:51:28] <teut> ya that's no problem, I remember that
[15:51:41] <nedbat> hexnewbie: in python 3, variables in comprehensions don't end up in the enclosing scope

[16:02:14] <teut> correct, the negation of   if a> b   is  if(a<=b)

[16:04:49] <bjs> teut: I think you would benefit from trying more debugging approaches.  For instance here, you'd probably have found this if you came up with a few 2x2 and 3x3 examples to try
[16:05:26] *** Joins: weedmic (~weedmic@5.102.235.240)
[16:05:35] <bjs> teut: one thing you should do when doing puzzles like this is try make your own test suite to check the answer, and don't give it back to the website until you're sure it's correct
[16:05:57] <teut> if its a number , or a 1D list ,  I probably would have done it , but 2D grids , thats too much numbers
[16:05:58] <bjs> and just writing tests doesn't mean you have to completely change the way you develop and instead do TDD ...
[16:06:06] <bjs> teut: a 2x2 grid is 4 numbers
[16:07:05] <bjs> Idk how many numbers is too much, but with a 3x3 or a 2x4 or whatever you have lots of room to play with examples; it seems a waste to just not do it at all?

[18:50:09] <gurki> i need to do some modifications to a python package installed via venv. google tells me that generally speaking tinkering with the python environment like that is bad practice, is this acceptable within a virtualenv? python seems to have some cached cpython files, i assume i need to clear that cache somehow (how?)
[18:50:49] <gurki> i can pull that package manually, but given that all of this happens in a venv i can just dump if things go wrong i assumed i might be fine
[18:50:53] <grym> gurki: you can certainly hack around inside a venv's packages.  The trick is that all of those changes are not versioned or tracked in any way, so don't do development that way

[18:56:01] <kek_> Hi, I have a script with a bunch of functions to generate data. I currently try to give it more structure by using classes. I need some direction here. Assume you have a WaveformGenerator() class and you need to generate 100k waveforms. Would one rather do a WaveformGenerator::generate() function for 1 waveform and make a loop outside of the class in some main function to generate 100k or would you make a
[18:56:01] <kek_> waveformGenerator::generate(N) function and generate the 100k "inside" the class? In my case I directly write it to a file and will parallelize it (if that somehow matters).

[19:45:16] <powftw> It's funny that I took 12 days to build something and today is the 4th day debugging the same. Some things I've learnt 1- Make code simple as possible (thanks to bjs: for this suggestion) 2- make function names relatable or meaningful. 3- when lost, take a pen, paper and write down concept again. 4- take breaks when get lost in thinking, it helped me to solve some problems, because when I sit infront of screen, I do all possible
[19:45:16] <powftw> things without more thinking than I would If I take a break. 5- keep motivated and don't force yourself to deadline, do small chunks of tasks each day, yet perfectly, so each day we'll be happy that we are moving (it's arguable that amount of work we should do a day, it depends on person).. last, this community is awesome 😎

[22:41:05] <mojoberlin> Hello, who feels appointed to assist me with my Python problem "indexerror list index out of range".  In our college course we wrote a little game called rock paper scissors . I created it with VSC 1.6 and Jupyter Notebook. I use an Ascii image for rock scissors and paper.  I also have a few screenshots of my problem in case someone can help me
[22:41:44] <mojoberlin> I hope that I'm in the right place here  :)

I'll see if that works around, but I'm also interested in actually fixing my OS haha. I don't get how Ubuntu offers multiple version of python3, yet it has packages like "python3-distutils" which, by the name, seems minor-version-agnostic.
[23:02:09] <mojoberlin> sorry i am not good with python
[23:02:20] <gry> mojoberlin: you have line ``print(game_images[user_choice])
[23:02:28] <gry> mojoberlin: move it further down in the code
[23:02:38] <gry> mojoberlin: after  print("You typed an invalid number, you lose!")
[23:03:10] <deniska> dtux: packages named python3- are for the "system python"
