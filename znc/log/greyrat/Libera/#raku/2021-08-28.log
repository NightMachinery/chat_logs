[02:42:47] <pisa> rakudo -v says above.
[02:44:49] <lizmat> yeah, that's too old

[13:36:42] <spacekookie> howdy! I'm trying to write a raku program that uses a multi sub MAIN to distinguish between different usages. But for some reason only one of my functions is ever called (and prints the help text if I don't provide the needed parameters) https://dev.spacekookie.de/kookie/nomicon/src/branch/main/apps/phototool/pt-import
[13:45:27] <lizmat> lose the "--" on the "--version"
[13:45:39] <lizmat> that is, if you want it to work like "foo version"
[13:45:50] <lizmat> rather than: "foo --version"
[13:46:10] <lizmat> if the latter, change the signature to:   :$version!
[13:46:19] <lizmat> aka, a required named parameter "version"

[13:47:59] <spacekookie> Hmm
[13:50:01] <spacekookie> That's kinda annoying because neither of them are a standard way of asking for the version of a program x)
[13:50:32] <lizmat> so what is the standard way of asking the version of a program in your opinion?
[13:50:38] <spacekookie> This is especially weird to me because if I change my functions to be "multi sub f" and then call f(|@*ARGS) then it works
[13:50:44] <spacekookie> foo --version
[13:51:00] <lizmat> then the signature should be :$version!
[13:51:54] <lizmat> which will make it call that candidate with --version
[13:52:14] <spacekookie> Hmm, yea I guess that works
[13:52:49] <spacekookie> Aah yea okay and if I then constrain the type to Bool then I get rid of the ugly --version[=Any] tail in the usage
[13:52:51] <spacekookie> Thanks!

[17:00:02] <raydiak> .antipairs is still my final answer but just for reference after a bit of reading, rust's .enumerate would be something along the lines of .pairs.map or .kv.map in raku, and our .zip is the Z operator: `@list Z 0..*` (or the less common synonymous zip function: `zip @list, 0..*`)

[22:36:05] <kybr> what are NuT and DeT types?
[22:39:17] <kybr> > No such method 'gist' for invocant of type 'NuT'
[22:39:41] <kybr> > Type check failed in binding to parameter '<anon>'; expected Any but got DeT (DeT)
[22:40:00] <gfldex> kybr: those are not buildins
[22:40:58] <kybr> i have not yet made a minimal example to test, but the NuT/DeT types made me curious, so i'm asking about those. 
[22:41:36] <ugexe> where are you reading about Nut and DeT types?
[22:41:53] <kybr> not; cant find anything so far.
[22:43:08] <kybr> just searched the moarvm github and found nothing.
[22:44:22] <ugexe> if you have never read anything on these types why do you think they are a thing?
[22:45:34] <ugexe> like i dont know what those are period, let alone in the context of raku
[22:48:33] <kybr> well, raku error messages mentioned these types and i didn't create them. https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/search?q=NuT
[22:48:44] <gfldex> kybr: if a type defines methods, you can use introspection to get holed of the Method object and call .file and .line on it.

[22:51:05] <ugexe> its a named typed capture
[22:52:11] <ugexe> although i agree that would be confusing to reference in an error message
