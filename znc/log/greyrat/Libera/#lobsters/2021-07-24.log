[00:11:57] <gwozniak> I have, incredibly and depressingly, come across a situation where I actually want to use m4
[00:12:19] <edk> have you ruled out lighting yourself on fire
[00:12:33] <edk> it might be pleasanter
[00:13:55] <riv> lol
[00:14:07] <riv> have fun with m4
[00:14:36] <gwozniak> edk: I gave it some thought, but the constraints of the situation have kind of forced my hand
[00:15:05] <gwozniak> The alternative is some even more grotty Tcl
[00:15:42] <gwozniak> The last paragraph of this intro is total bullshit: https://www.gnu.org/software/m4/manual/html_node/Intro.html#Intro

[00:15:59] <riv> picking between m4 and tcl :P
[00:16:16] <Remosi> I'd go with tcl
[00:16:24] <Remosi> at least tcl has some highlevel constructs
[00:16:32] <Remosi> m4 doesn't even have for loops
[00:16:54] <gwozniak> It does, but I don't need them
[00:17:25] <gwozniak> I'd use the C preprocessor, but I need to be able to output comments and that is problematic with CPP
[00:17:38] <Remosi> yeah I've run into that problem before
[00:18:55] <gwozniak> I could use shell code from Tcl but then the information to use would be all over the place. With m4, I can have all the parts in one file.
[00:19:12] <gwozniak> Least worst of all worlds, I guess
[00:21:55] <Remosi> fair
[00:22:33] <gwozniak> Hrm... now that I'm writing in one of the worst languages ever created, I see other options that may be less unpleasant

[22:51:46] <edk> (that used to happen naturally, but it doesn't any more)
[22:53:43] <edk> anyway, when you "burn" wood to char it you're not actually burning most of the carbon (except whatever you burned for fuel), you're burning everything else

[22:58:08] <edk> it's not strictly true that it doesn't happen any more, but it's much rarer now, because dead trees are broken down soon after they die. they don't get a chance to become fossils
