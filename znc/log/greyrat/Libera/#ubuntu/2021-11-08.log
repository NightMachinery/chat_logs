[01:38:34] <ravage> in general the server versions are the same as the desktop version with the same name. there is a server kernel and a server install
[01:39:08] <tomreyn> server kernel?
[01:39:09] <ravage> you can turn any server install into a desktop installation with a few commands
[01:39:27] <ravage> there used to be one
[01:39:35] <ravage> did they get rid of it? :D
[01:39:45] <ravage> i never used itg
[01:40:28] <ravage> ok. my bad. no kernel. so we are down to the "fancy" server installer i dont like :D
[01:40:37] <tomreyn> there are ones for public clouds, and a kernel package for vm's, i think (but i think that also uses the default kernel)
[01:40:42] <Fault> deksar: even-numbered versions(/years) are LTS releases, odd are not. Hence the differing support durations.
[01:41:25] <deksar> great tips :) thanks.
[01:41:47] <Fault> 👍
[01:42:11] <ravage> my personal opinion is to keep your servers on LTS unless you need some new fancy stuff only provided in the versions between
[01:42:52] <Bashing-om> ^^ and now Intel CPUs: https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Ubuntu-Intel-IoT-Optimized .
[01:43:46] <ravage> oh and there is #ubuntu-server for more support about it :)
[01:43:55] <deksar> "unless you need some new fancy stuff " <- oh, that's me, an OpenBSD guy -> disabled everything by the default. Keyboard barely types :P - no HT neither on CPU.

[02:39:14] <Nik> Hey guys! I did the big stupid and now my laptop is not booting. :/ Had a Win 10 install on a laptop, partitioned the SSD, added a Linux (Ubuntu Desktop 20.04) install onto that, it came with its own boot menu that allowed me to select which system to boot to. In a stroke of extraordinary genius I deleted the Linux partition while working on Windows (because I thought I didn't need it anymore). Now it only boots to some sort of grub CLI.
[02:39:14] <Nik> Anything I can do to boot to my Windows partition?

[15:19:34] <qskwood> klausfiend, https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2009/03/msg00780.html
[15:20:47] <qskwood> TL;DR The process began in early 2009
[15:21:06] <Kolusion> Is it just me or does the man page for 'ip' suck? It says there is the option '-a' but when I use it like 'ip -a' it doesn't work, but 'ip a' does.
[15:21:45] <qskwood> They're completely different arguments
[15:21:52] <Kolusion> Let me see......
[15:21:57] <qskwood> -a iterates your command over all objects available
[15:22:46] <Kolusion> Yes I see. I can't find anything for just 'a' though..
[15:23:13] *** Joins: pycurious (~Adium@user/pycurious)
[15:23:16] <qskwood> That's because "a" isn't really a command
[15:23:27] <qskwood> ip is just smart enough to infer what you mean
[15:23:35] <Kolusion> It is, 'ip' and 'ip a' produce different results
[15:23:39] *** Quits: tmp1 (~tmp@185.25.224.202) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[15:23:45] <qskwood> `ip a` will work
[15:23:50] <qskwood> so will `ip addr`
[15:24:02] <Kolusion> The man page just sucks.
[15:24:03] <qskwood> so will `ip addres` (missing an s)
[15:24:08] <qskwood> The man page is fine
[15:24:18] <Kolusion> If it was fine, 'a' would be defined. It's not.
[15:24:23] <qskwood> It is defined
[15:24:26] <qskwood> the command is `address`
[15:24:31] <qskwood> you are simply free to abbreviate it
[15:24:37] *** Joins: spaceangel (~spaceange@ip-89-176-181-220.net.upcbroadband.cz)
[15:24:38] <qskwood> There is no "a" command
[15:24:41] <Kolusion> No, it's not documented.
[15:24:48] <qskwood> It's documented fine
[15:24:49] <Kolusion> If there was no command, it wouldn't work.
[15:24:55] <Kolusion> Where is it documented?
[15:25:00] <qskwood> It is a command, you are simply free to abbreviate it
[15:25:07] <qskwood> It's a pretty common concept
[15:25:13] <qskwood> see Cisco IOS for example
[15:25:16] <Kolusion> Not to me.
[15:25:33] <qskwood> as long as what you type isn't ambiguous the program will assume what you're trying to do

[15:25:44] <Kolusion> Dangerous
[15:25:53] <qskwood> It's not dangerous at all
[15:26:04] <qskwood> If you want to use the full object you still can
[15:26:06] <Kolusion> LOL I wouldn't like 'rm' to assume what I am trying to do.
[15:26:34] <qskwood> That's not an apples to apples comparison
[15:27:22] <qskwood> Each of the iproute2 object names can be shortened to the shortest unique set of characters. This means that ip route show can be abbreviated ip ro s and ip rule show can be abbreviated ip ru s. Also ip address show can be ip a s.
[15:28:03] <Kolusion> The assumption is the user knows that know.
[15:28:08] <qskwood> No it's not
[15:28:14] <qskwood> the documentation clearly uses full object names
[15:28:23] <qskwood> Nowhere does the man page suggest you abbreviate
[15:28:27] <qskwood> it's an advanced usage.
[15:28:32] <Kolusion> I didn't even know there was an object.
[15:28:50] <qskwood> You'd know if you ran `ip` with no arguments
[15:29:07] <qskwood> it clearly tells you "Usage: ip [ OPTIONS ] OBJECT { COMMAND | help }"
[15:29:18] <qskwood> object is the only mandatory argument
[15:29:46] <Kolusion> I just ran it and see the word address, but what the function doesn't is not explained.

[15:30:10] <qskwood> address is the object, the commands are listed in the next section of the man page
[15:30:17] <Kolusion> Yes
[15:30:29] <Kolusion> I got lucky, 'ip a' worked how I wanted it to anyway.

[16:02:44] <Kolusion> Thanks KBar
[16:02:57] <Kolusion> So I have a PPTP VPN server and a PPTP VPN client. The PPTP server uses port 1723 and GRE. The client's computer has a UFW firewall. When the firewall is disabled, the client connect fine. When it is enabled, it starts the connection to the server, but then then the connection times out after 30 seconds. The server reports "LCP: timeout sending
[16:02:58] <Kolusion> Config-Requests". I suspect this has something to do with GRE and UFW on the client side. Anyone know how to fix this?
[16:03:06] <KBar> Kolusion use n to go forward and N (shift+n) to go backwards
[16:03:20] <TJ-> man is using the default pager which is generally 'less'
[16:03:24] <KBar> Kolusion "?" (shift+/) will search the document backwards
[16:04:14] <qskwood> To see listening TCP sockets, you use `ss -l`
[16:05:02] <KBar> Kolusion searching for gre is ufw's manpage, this is the 4th result: ufw allow in on eth0 to 192.168.0.1 proto gre
[16:05:02] <KBar>        This will allow all gre traffic to 192.168.0.1 on the eth0 interface.
[16:05:07] <KBar> *in ufw's
[16:06:38] <Kolusion> KBAR, yes I saw that. I was hoping for an easier answer. I will try it now.
[16:07:20] <qskwood> On the server end you can include "silent" in /etc/ppp/options
[16:07:35] <Kolusion> qskwood. Cool. What does that do?
[16:08:07] <qskwood> One source quotes: "With this option, pppd will not transmit LCP packets to initiate a connection until a valid LCP packet is received from the peer (as for the "passive" option with old versions of pppd)."

[16:15:54] <Kolusion> I contacted OpenVPN, after sending my message, the website said the message was not received. Then I received an e-mail that said to sign-up and send the message again. lol. Then I tried their forum, upon signing up, the forum could not be found.
[16:16:10] <Kolusion> Look a step 1 'Static Key Mini-HOWTO'

[16:16:43] <qskwood> if a howto that straightforward doesn't work it's probably something people other than you would have noticed by now
[16:16:57] <Kolusion> Commands and instructions on changing configuration files are stylised the same. It took me 20 minutes to figure it out.

[16:17:09] <Kolusion> But then it didn't work anyway, I gave up and went to Poptop
[16:17:21] <Kolusion> No, OpenVPN just sucks.
[16:17:28] <Kolusion> Try the instructions yourself.
[16:17:32] <Kolusion> It doesn't work
[16:17:49] <qskwood> Maybe not.
[16:17:56] <Kolusion> This is probably why PPTP is still the most common VPN protocol, it just works.
[16:18:00] <Gallomimia> it's extremely arrogant to believe that just because you can't get it working the software sucks and no one should use it.
[16:18:30] <Kolusion> It's got nothing to do with arrogance, it's a fact. Follow the instructions step-by-step and you will see for yourself.
[16:18:56] <qskwood> I would suggest that if you're getting disconnected from any server every 15 seconds it's probably a network problem.
[16:19:12] <qskwood> OpenVPN is pretty widely used.
[16:19:14] <Kolusion> It says "server configuration file" but fails to mention where it is located.

[16:19:59] <Gallomimia> perhaps the instructions are less than forthcoming. perhaps there's another problem causing issues. but to say that a piece of software used by millions of people "just sucks" is everything to do with arrogance

[16:20:41] <Kolusion> Well, my experience is it sucks. I can only go by my experience with it.
[16:20:44] <qskwood> It's not really the job of the documentation team to specify it for every system out there.
[16:21:08] <qskwood> They could give one or two examples, but really it's likely in /etc/openvpn on a Linux system.
[16:21:10] <Gallomimia> and that's the definition of arrogance. so, i think you need to adjust your attitude if you want some help
[16:21:25] <Kolusion> qskwood, yeah, that would have been good to know 3 weeks ago.
[16:21:47] <Kolusion> I don't use a 'Linux system'. I use Ubuntu. Not every Linux system is the same.
[16:22:02] <Gallomimia> this does raise an important point however. whose responsibility is it to document where the configs are? the package maintainer for ubuntu?
[16:22:09] <Kolusion> Different distros have different file locations.
[16:22:11] <qskwood> 99% of Linux systems place configuration data in /etc
[16:22:21] <Kolusion> I didn't know that.
[16:22:24] <Kolusion> It assumed.
[16:22:26] <Kolusion> Dangerous to assume.
[16:22:41] <qskwood> If you had searched for OpenVPN Ubuntu 20.04, for example, you would have found where the configuration file goes in the first result.
[16:22:46] <Gallomimia> it is. and it's a problem not limited to openvpn
[16:22:49] <Kolusion> Bad documentation is a really bad thing in FOSS projects.
[16:22:55] <qskwood> This is just stuff you need to learn over time.

[16:25:31] <Gallomimia> sigh. yeah if the website doesn't even have accurate contact information..
[16:26:09] <qskwood> There are three emails listed on their site: sales, press, and security
[16:26:24] <Kolusion> It's not that it didn't have accurate contact informaton, the form accepts your message and then says it's not delivered, then you get an e-mail saying to sign-up and send it. Then two days later someone does response to you anyway. lol they really haven't got their shit together.
[16:26:27] <qskwood> Massive enterprises don't usually want emails requesting support

[16:27:44] <Kolusion> Gallomimia: True, but that is not why I tried contacting them. I didn't bother fixing the docs because I am not going to waste my time fixing a product for a company that doesn't have it's shit together.
[16:27:52] <Gallomimia> very much likely they're spending their limited resources on paying customers, if they have any
[16:28:11] <Kolusion> Gallomimia: Sure, that's business.
[16:28:17] <Gallomimia> alright. well maybe you shouldn't use ubuntu either?
[16:28:24] <Kolusion> Gallomimia: Why?
[16:28:39] <qskwood> For one thing you seem to hate the idea of putting any effort into achieving your goals.
[16:28:53] <Gallomimia> another free product. the support you're receiving now is provided by volunteers, not anyone from the company
[16:28:59] <Kolusion> qskwood: Not at all, I achieved my goal. I have a working VPN server.
[16:28:59] <qskwood> You'd be better of running something like RHEL and paying a vendor to set stuff up for you.
[16:29:16] <Kolusion> Gallomimia: Yes, but Canonical have their shit together.
[16:29:19] <Gallomimia> ubuntu also has paid support
[16:29:23] <qskwood> LMAO
[16:29:33] <Gallomimia> they do NOT in fact have it together.
[16:29:33] <qskwood> Canonical is not exactly a poster child
[16:29:35] <Kolusion> qskwood: To a degree ;)
[16:29:44] <Kolusion> hahahaha
[16:29:44] <qskwood> They screw up just like anyone else
[16:30:15] <Gallomimia> have you tried looking for an irc channel like this one, but for openvpn?
[16:30:19] <Kolusion> qskwood: I can set things up fine, if I have documentation that actually makes sense.
[16:30:44] <Kolusion> Gallomimia: Nah, I moved on from OpenVPN to Poptop. Poptop worked.
[16:30:44] <qskwood> https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/service-openvpn
[16:31:18] <Kolusion> Poptop's documentation was bad too, but it made sense and I put effort into it.
[16:31:42] <Kolusion> Poptop's documentation is comments in configuration files. lol
[16:32:10] <qskwood> If you want to use an 8 year old VPN server that's fine
[16:32:23] <Kolusion> It's much older than eight years.
[16:32:27] <Kolusion> This thing is ancient.
[16:32:34] <Gallomimia> probably secure then

[20:01:09] <matthewcroughan_> Does anybody know how to force the Linux kernel to boot in Long Mode for a 64 Bit processor that the BIOS lies about being 32 bit? I have an intel n2600 and it supports 32 bit, but the BIOS lies about it and the kernel therefore fails to boot. Ubuntu and Alpine linux both boot successfully in 64 bit mode, for some reason, probably because they patched their kernels.

[20:09:00] <matthewcroughan_> Maybe it's netboot.xyz that is doing it, since it loads an initial kernel that might ignore the motherboard's bogus data.
