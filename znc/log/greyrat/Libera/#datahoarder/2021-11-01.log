[18:48:27] <ran> Can anybody here help me do something somewhat controvercial?
[18:48:54] <ran> how do I set a private torrent as public when I don't have the data on my hard drive to recreate the torrent from scratch?
[18:53:19] <superkuh> Edit the trackers and add in a public one.
[18:54:02] <ran> I want to turn on DHT for the torrent but that feature is disabled for private torrents
[19:04:17] <brimstone> it's probably just a bit in the torrent file itself
[19:05:10] <ran> I'm sure it is but every torrent client I know of has code in place to prevent me from doing it

[19:24:11] <evilgohan2> just a warning: turning on DHT and/or adding another tracker to a private torrent is a good way to catch a ban from a private tracker

[21:05:02] <x10> recommended, doesn't mean impossible, quick google shows it's just sonarr/radarr/something to download/plex combo, then storing older files on remote storage
[21:05:48] <twomanytacos> yeah but when projects that are already this configured doing a small config change or moving to a different path means going a couple rabbit holes and i want to avoid that
[21:05:48] <x10> the vfs part might be a bit shittier from home depending on your connection 
[21:07:12] <twomanytacos> i already have plex on x220 so i can watch 80s anime mostly and i made a script to organize media but then i realized this is already done by someone else so i went and started looking
[21:07:26] <twomanytacos> cloudbox is the closest but i want something that i can install locally and run there
[21:07:49] <twomanytacos> https://zacholland.net/a-complete-guide-to-setting-up-a-plex-home-media-server-with-automated-requests-downloads/#transmission
[21:08:06] <twomanytacos> this is the closest but too much time to invest
[21:15:54] <evilgohan2> x220?
[21:15:58] <evilgohan2> As in a Thinkpad X220?
[21:16:28] <twomanytacos> yep
[21:16:44] <evilgohan2> heh
[21:17:10] <twomanytacos> i know i know, i just switched to a T490 as my main machine but i want to keep the x220 in use
[21:17:13] <evilgohan2> I suppose that, so long as no transcoding is needed, that's quite viable.
[21:17:57] <evilgohan2> Eh, I had Plex running on a Dell Latitude E7450 for a while there lol
[21:18:33] <evilgohan2> and concurrently, another instance running on an old HP with an E8600 in it for Live TV capture.
[21:18:36] <evilgohan2> both of those have been retired.
[21:18:53] <evilgohan2> However, they definitely stuck around for quite some time.
[21:19:56] <evilgohan2> side note: is musicbrainz.org down for anyone else?

[22:42:54] <evilgohan2> Oh, and then, to top it all off, they had to call a third party to assess - except said third party's close of business was midnight. So it was both time sensitive AND they were still late.

[22:47:54] <evilgohan2> the doctor (who never saw me, but his p.a. did) was out of network
[22:48:03] <evilgohan2> So they billed separately.

[22:53:54] <joepie91> I'm just amazed at how healthcare in the US is always worse than I thought 5 minutes ago
[22:58:18] <sarnold> it's been twenty years since I went to the ER; it was a simple finger cut but the damn thing was big and wouldn't stop bleeding .. it was probably 45 minute wait to get to the front of the line, and by the time I got there, a family came in with a kid screaming and holding his head.. it sure didn't feel right to delay them any, so it was probably another fifteen minutes before they did my intake, and 
[22:58:24] <sarnold> probably half an hour later before a doctor saw it, stuck some butterfly bandages on it, and asked when my last tetanus shot was..
