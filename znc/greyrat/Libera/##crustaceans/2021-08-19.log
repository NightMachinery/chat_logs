[08:33:27] <quanticle> Also, you know how I was saying a few days ago that my brother bought an iPhone SE because of iMessage?
[08:33:33] <quanticle> I was (partially) wrong
[08:33:57] <quanticle> I was speaking with him today, and he told me that while iMessage was *a* factor, the dominant reason he bought the iPhone is because of Facetime
[08:34:37] <quanticle> His school (like many schools) has been pretty much totally remote learning for the past year, and his classmates *insisted* on using Facetime for study groups, etc
[08:34:46] <quanticle> Which, as an Android user, he obviously could not participate in
[08:35:15] <quanticle> So mea culpa, iMessage isn't the lock-in
[08:35:17] <quanticle> Facetime is
[08:35:49] <manicennui> heh
[08:36:00] <manicennui> I have never once used Facetime.
[08:36:34] <manicennui> I have a friend with whom I video chat once in a while, and we use zoom usually.
[08:36:38] <quanticle> Yeah, I guess that's why you never felt locked in
[08:36:56] <quanticle> My point to him was, "Why can't your study group use WhatsApp?"
[08:39:25] <cb> ive never heard of anyone using facetime
[08:45:55] <companion_cube> that's super shitty quanticle
[08:46:05] <companion_cube> to have to do that, I mean
[08:46:22] <manicennui> And he had to kiss Tim Apple's feet.
[08:48:32] <quanticle> Yeah, that's super shitty. Like, I feel like it's way worse to force someone to buy an entire new phone than it is to install an app on yours
[08:52:45] <manicennui> The question is why no other companies seem to be able to get their shit together.
[08:53:19] <manicennui> Look at the shitshow thatt is Google chat apps.
[08:53:31] <manicennui> And video chat apps.
[08:58:19] <quanticle> lol someone at Ars Technica the other day, posted a multi-page article detailing the history and timeline of Google chat apps
[08:58:35] <quanticle> And I was thinking, the existence of this article really says it all.
[08:58:58] <quanticle> The fact that someone can write a multi-thousand word article on all the various chat apps your company has put out and abandoned...
[09:00:16] <indigo> Hey man, those chat apps got some folks promoted
[09:23:14] <martian67> what are they at now? 7? 8?
[09:23:19] <martian67> most of them mutually incompatable
[09:31:17] <quanticle> Let's see. Google Talk. Google Hangouts. Google Voice had its own chat, didn't it? There's Android Messages (i.e. the SMS app). Allo. Google Chat (which replaces Google Hangouts). That's six that I can remember, and I'm *sure* I'm forgetting at least one.

[09:53:40] <manicennui> I watched The Green Knight tonight, and didn't really understand it. After reading the discussion on reddit I now understand why, and it sounds like it is a great film if you knew more about the Arthurian legends.
[09:53:57] <alyx> cb: tbh Facetime is *so good*
[09:54:33] <manicennui> I think that's true of most of the Apple apps like that. They are either great or were at one time.
[09:54:55] <alyx> I dunno how things have changed post-covid now that everyone and their cat has invested into "video not being ass" but
[09:54:58] <manicennui> Google's machine learning can't tell it how to make a great video chat app.
[09:55:13] <alyx> last time I was actually using Apple stuff, Facetime was easily the best option for video
[09:55:21] <manicennui> But I bet their icon colors are perfect!
[09:55:41] <alyx> god Google's iconography is so horrible tbh
[09:55:53] <alyx> after their "rebrand" all their app icons are just vaguely similar blurs
[10:13:10] <quanticle> Does wave even count, though

[15:21:27] <prussian> Brekkjern: because of libc
[15:27:25] <Geekingfrog> from a few months ago: https://tailscale.com/blog/sisyphean-dns-client-linux/ the diagram toward the end is… uhm… interesting
[15:27:25] <buttsbot> The Sisyphean Task Of DNS Client Config on Linux · Tailscale
[15:28:31] <Geekingfrog> I guess that's also a consequence of not having a central authority over the entire system. Distros can do pretty much whatever they want.
[15:37:18] <Brekkjern> Geekingfrog: Yeah. I was thinking about that post all the time I was debugging this shit
[15:37:32] <Geekingfrog> what problem are you having rn ?
[15:37:47] <Brekkjern> Turns out it's just resolved that has shitty handing of DNSSEC
[15:38:05] <Brekkjern> It has an allow-downgrade setting, but it doesn't really work...
[15:57:59] <gwozniak> re earlier Facetime discussion: I have rarely used it but when I have, it has been stellar
[15:58:48] <gwozniak> Stayed up last night and wrote a long message about the AI/ML stuff for compilers to my boss because I felt I had better not wait
[15:59:55] <riv> AI/ML in the same sentence as compiler aaaaaaaaa
[15:59:59] <gwozniak> I mentioned that it's been a research topic for 10 years and I've yet to hear of any interesting uses or deployments of it, and I've been following GCC and LLVM for a while, as well as many compiler researchers on social media
[16:01:30] <gwozniak> And actually hooking it into the compiler would present some challenges based on how we currently do things
[16:16:10] <Xe> Geekingfrog: oh god I think that's already out of date
[16:17:00] <alyx> Xe: oh jesus christ what
[16:18:24] <Xe> alyx: okay so there's a networkmanager bug that tailscale was apparently relying on
[16:18:34] <alyx> ...oh no
[16:18:37] <Geekingfrog> oops
[16:18:48] <Brekkjern> lol
[16:19:03] <Xe> however most of the cases that involve that version of networkmanager and newer also run resolved
[16:19:09] <Xe> so you can just run resolved
[16:19:17] <Xe> s/run/configure
[16:19:25] <alyx> so there's now
[16:19:26] <Brekkjern> Why is this so damn complicated :P
[16:19:31] <alyx> a _fourth_ way to do it
[16:20:38] <Xe> Brekkjern: well-intentioned people trying to fix problems with a combination of conway's law and the lack of cross-project pollenation much like you'd get at somewhere like Apple if the DNS resolution crap and the network config crap were done by different teams
[16:21:02] <Xe> also this isn't even talking about Android lol
[16:21:22] <alyx> Xe: out of curiosity, what's the process for handling dns on macs like?
[16:21:34] <Brekkjern> Xe: I know :(
[16:22:15] <Brekkjern> I can't wait until a NetworkManager-like is eventually made by the systemd project so this shit won't be as complicated :P
[16:22:46] <Xe> alyx: i think it's somewhat sensible but tailscale has to set a few dozen reverse DNS routes for magic reverse dns to work
[16:22:52] <alyx> ...oh god
[16:24:00] <Xe> Brekkjern: if that happens it will just be more work on Tailscale's side. Tailscale is not in a position to tell users they are doing things wrong (save for the cases where people chatter the immutable flag on /etc/resolv.conf) and the whole "it's magic" thing means Tailscale needs to Just Work™
[16:24:33] <Brekkjern> Xe: I know it will be more work for you guys, but at least there probably won't be as many bugs on a "normal" system
[16:24:44] <alyx> ....
[16:24:55] <alyx> Xe: how often have you ran into "someone just fucking made resolv.conf immutable"
[16:25:10] <Xe> only a few times on hacker news comments

[19:39:02] <manicennui> Go back to? I never stopped.
[19:39:23] <manicennui> Although I haven't had a doughnut in a while.
[19:39:24] <companion_cube> donuts are truly dangerous
[19:39:32] <manicennui> Mostly because I don't have any.
[19:39:52] <manicennui> Last night I had an Italian beef sandwich and fries though.
[19:40:57] <mouseghost> woa an iphone ;3
[19:41:11] <kirch> I got me some "spreadable brie-flavored cheese" and it's been making ham sandwiches terrific
[19:42:46] <kirch> but last night I had a crummy Stoffer's Lasagne, because I love it... I can only find it in single-serving size which is fine because I'm the only person in my family willing to eat it
[19:45:39] <manicennui> I haven't had a Stoffer's in forever.

[19:47:39] <manicennui> I also have a bunch of Tasty Bite pouches.
[19:51:54] <ngoldbaum> nasty bite
[19:52:19] <kirch> the spreadable stuff tricked me -- it's from a known brie-maker, came in a lil' wheel box like other brie - but is a flavoured spread and not brie
[19:52:30] <ngoldbaum> one too many chana masalas on a backpacking trip made me hate tasty bites forever
[20:01:02] <manicennui> My main issue with Tasty Bite is that their stuff doesn't have enough spice.

[22:13:44] <companion_cube> you should suggest hare and qbe
[22:15:28] <gwozniak> We could look at it, but I wouldn't suggest moving to it at this time
[22:16:00] <gwozniak> I don't think the "less code for the compiler" is much of a goal

[22:24:12] <Geekingfrog> tbh, I'd be interested. I'm toying with the idea of moving away from webtech and doing more low level stuff. But I'm really scared of C. Last time I touched that was during uni, and in the meantime, I mostly gathered horror stories.

[22:35:08] <Geekingfrog> wrl, yeah, I'm getting more and more into rust. Which is cool. But I think if I want to move toward lower level work, C/C++ is unavoidable. There is just so much stuff already written in these languages.

[22:38:20] <gwozniak> Geekingfrog: yeah, all legacy low-level stuff is C/C++ so you do have to be familiar with it
[22:38:43] <gwozniak> We're trying to get Rust to happen, but it's a long game
[22:39:03] <companion_cube> why not Ada, heh? 🙃
[22:39:25] <Geekingfrog> 👋 companion_cube
[22:40:15] <gwozniak> companion_cube: not against Ada either! May even be an easier sell
[22:40:30] <dcz_> you don't need to abandon Rust in order to take advantage of stuff written in C
[22:40:46] <dcz_> (except when it's a macro/template)
[22:40:48] <Geekingfrog> I do need to kind of understand the stuff written in C though
[22:40:59] <gwozniak> So I'm back on the compiler that I worked on when I started here and.... I have thoughts
[22:41:19] <indigo> Did other folks mess it up
[22:41:21] <riv> oh?
[22:41:21] <dcz_> ah, yeah, you do need to learn those languages, but not necessarily use them
[22:41:25] <gwozniak> Just getting a local build environment going has been way too much work
[22:41:36] <riv> just make a nerual network compile code for you, the you dont have to write any algorithms
[22:41:37] <riv> sorry :)
[22:41:45] <Geekingfrog> :D
[22:41:49] <gwozniak> Geekingfrog: most C I write these days is test cases
[22:42:01] <Geekingfrog> so I've heard
[22:42:12] <companion_cube> gwozniak: I hear Ada has cool primitives for hardware interactions actually
[22:42:35] <gwozniak> Anything substantial is C++, even though it's more like C than any modern C++
[22:42:49] <gwozniak> companion_cube: yeah, I've been meaning to take a serious look at it some time
[22:43:42] <companion_cube> the AdaCore website is full of interesting stuff
[22:43:58] <companion_cube> I've just browsed by curiosity but if I was writing embedded stuff it'd be reasonably appealing I think
[22:45:53] <gwozniak> The one thing that we provide that's really helpful is headers that describe all the hardware, which makes writing for the device a lot simpler
[22:45:58] <manicennui> Isn't Ada more common in some military/government jobs?
[22:46:38] <gwozniak> So having a good language is only the first step. If you are constantly looking up bit positions in the data sheet and making all your own constants, it's a real pain
[22:47:17] <gwozniak> But when you already have a struct describing some internal registers that are mapped to memory, it's so much nicer
[22:48:01] <manicennui> gwozniak: You should go all Jonathan Blow and create your own C++-like language, but for embedded development.
[22:48:50] <gwozniak> Honestly, Rust or C++ would be better than C. But there is a lot of resistance because of the fear based on all the abstraction
[22:49:09] <riv> yeah rust!
[22:53:25] <companion_cube> [](auto auto) -> auto { auto }
[22:54:03] <companion_cube> gwozniak: rust does crates for that, it seems, like one crate per chip or something like that
[22:54:38] <gwozniak> There are tools to convert hardware description XML files to Rust that we've experimented with
[22:55:26] <gwozniak> We have thousands of parts, easily hundreds that are 32-bit, so we'd have to convert our infra to deal with all that
[22:56:01] <Brekkjern> I should learn something that could go low-level at some point
[22:56:13] <gwozniak> There aren't too many cores, but lots of parts
[22:56:31] <gwozniak> It's the peripheral and memory stuff that's the complicated part
[22:56:46] <Brekkjern> I know I might be doing assembly during this semester at uni though, so... Can't get much more low level than that...
[22:57:11] <gwozniak> The one part I was working with until recently had a struct whose sizeof was something like 80k
[22:57:22] <riv> that's terrifying
[22:57:28] <riv> ive never even heard of such a beast before
[22:57:43] <gwozniak> it's a part within a part, and had a whole slew of special registers and memory areas
[22:57:50] <manicennui> Brekkjern: FPGA?
[22:58:10] <Brekkjern> manicennui: Dunno. The course description is vague on the specifics.
[22:58:22] <manicennui> I mean as something more low level.
[22:58:28] <Brekkjern> Oh, yeah
[22:59:03] <gwozniak> Sigh... one header file changes in libc and I have to recompile all the libraries? Ugh.
[22:59:15] <gwozniak> Recompiling takes literally hours
[22:59:31] <Brekkjern> Time to brush up on your swordfighting skills then

[23:42:11] <mouseghost> tho tbh from positive things, ive managed to finally make a convincing derivation of an equation and my new phone arrived in the mail
[23:42:31] <mouseghost> and finally soldered the smol IC to homemade breakout board
[23:42:37] <kirch> good stuff here,,,, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EPbylsBuzg
[23:42:37] <manicennui> Sounds likely that we'll all be asked to get a booster.
[23:42:38] <buttsbot> Everything You Need to Know (And Forget) About Vaccines - YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EPbylsBuzg
[23:42:59] <manicennui> I think the US is right around 60% with at least one job, and 50% fully vaccinated.
[23:43:07] <manicennui> And the vaccine is widely and easily available.
[23:43:09] <manicennui> And free.
[23:43:17] <indigo> Yeah but magnets
[23:43:39] <manicennui> We'll probably have like 40% fully vaccinated with the booster by next year.
[23:43:45] <mouseghost> it starts to flat out at 40-50% here
[23:44:59] <manicennui> The people who refuse to get vaccinated and refuse to follow even basic precautions are basically petri dishes for new variants.
[23:45:03] <manicennui> Extending this thing.
[23:45:06] <mouseghost> i wonder how many are actively against and how many just dont care enough
[23:45:34] <manicennui> I don't know. I don't really talk to anyone who is that idiotic.
[23:45:44] <riv> magnets?
[23:46:00] <Brekkjern> Wait. Is there a dipshit sitting in a truck outside the library of congress threatening to blow it up?
[23:46:04] <manicennui> Pretty easy to have no one in your life like that here.
[23:46:06] <riv> yes there is
[23:46:20] <manicennui> What is his beef with the LoC?
[23:46:29] <riv> not really sure
[23:46:30] <Brekkjern> I believe he thinks it's the congress...
[23:46:32] <kirch> Brekkjern: not anymore
[23:46:38] <riv> LOL
[23:46:45] <mouseghost> what?
[23:46:49] <manicennui> So he wants to commit an even worse crime, but is too dumb.
[23:46:51] <kirch> to clarify - they didn't blow themselves up - they were captured or something
[23:46:56] <mouseghost> ahh
[23:47:05] <kirch> IME, when somebody says "I have a bomb" they never have a bomb.
[23:47:16] <Brekkjern> >OnlyFans to Block Sexually Explicit Videos Starting in October
[23:47:17] <Brekkjern> They are doing a Tumblr I see.
[23:47:23] <kirch> lololo what!?

[23:47:24] <buttsbot> Suspect who claimed to have a bomb near US Capitol has surrendered - CNNPolitics
[23:47:35] <kirch> "Pornhub to block sexually explicit videos starting soon"
[23:47:40] <manicennui> OnlyFans to go out of business in October.
[23:47:51] <riv> wont this actually increase buisness?
[23:47:56] <manicennui> Yeah, but Tumblr had a few non-porn accounts.
[23:48:15] <manicennui> OnlyFans is like 100% porn.
[23:48:20] <kirch> I was a non-porn Tumblr account
[23:48:36] <kirch> several, in fact... my personal/public bookmarks are on there still
[23:49:15] <manicennui> Video has been posted on Facebook by the suspect, a law enforcement official told CNN. A video that lasts about a half hour shows an individual from inside a truck, holding a cannister that he says is a bomb and speaking about a "revolution."
[23:49:34] <manicennui> The Senate and House are not in session, and most lawmakers are not currently in their offices.
[23:49:40] <manicennui> He didn't plan this well at all.
[23:50:12] <manicennui> How do people this dumb manage to live to adulthood?
[23:50:14] <companion_cube> he listened to Qanon and got angry
[23:50:30] <mouseghost> tumblr was also 16 yo girls
[23:50:36] <riv> Q is *still* a thing?
[23:53:11] <manicennui> https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/p7j9bt/on_michigan_ave_right_now_traffic_blocked/
[23:53:13] <buttsbot> On Michigan Ave right now, traffic blocked : chicago
[23:54:13] <companion_cube> riv: maybe not, but the followers have not suddenly sobered up :/
[23:54:25] <manicennui> "It is Ashura, a Shia Muslim holiday to commemorate the martyrdom of Hussein and his family/companions in the Battle of Karbala. It is a day of honor, grief, and remembrance"
[23:54:26] <manicennui> Hmm.
[23:55:32] <companion_cube> oh, a _different_ Hussein, wtf
[23:55:42] <companion_cube> changes a bit the outlook
[23:55:46] <riv> that's crazy, i haven't heard about it in months. i was hoping they'd stopped
[23:55:59] <manicennui> companion_cube: Yeah, this guy apparently: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Husayn_ibn_Ali
[23:55:59] <buttsbot> Husayn ibn Ali - Wikipedia
[23:56:08] <manicennui> Hard to tell what to actually think.
[23:56:28] <manicennui> Like what happened to him sounds horrific, but it's not clear that he was some great guy.
[23:57:12] <manicennui> He didn't get to become ruler even though he was the next in succession?
[23:57:24] <manicennui> Not sure that I care that his royalty wasn't respected.
[23:57:39] <companion_cube> :D
[23:58:26] <mouseghost> idk i dont want to say that he smart or anything, but for exwample would you call unabomber dumb
[23:59:23] <manicennui> He probably wasn't dumb.
[23:59:43] <manicennui> And I'm even sympathetic with his sentiments to some extent.
[23:59:49] <manicennui> But he was clearly a bit off.
