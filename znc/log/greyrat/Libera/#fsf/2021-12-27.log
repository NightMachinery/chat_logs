[00:36:40] <isf> the hackers, are people like us
[00:37:01] <isf> but they understend the differece between hackers and crackers ewwegweg_
[00:37:11] <ewwegweg_> Does fsf confirm these events
[00:37:30] <ewwegweg_> and why
[00:37:44] <isf> why what
[00:38:01] <ewwegweg_> hacking cracking etc.
[00:38:32] <isf> you dont know the difference
[00:38:44] <isf> but i say what the difference are
[00:38:59] <kompowiec> hackers they are build something, crackers destroy
[00:38:59] <isf> so, if you dont want know what the difference is, dont make more questions xD
[00:39:12] <Noisytoot> isf, Hacking isn't installing GNU/Linux.
[00:39:21] <isf> i dont say it
[00:39:26] <ewwegweg_> ı said cracker so okay
[00:39:43] <isf> that is kick off the sentence of the context Noisytoot
[00:40:09] <kompowiec> is probably the simplest possible difference to define.
[00:40:46] <ewwegweg_> test04
[00:40:52] <kompowiec> works
[00:40:56] <isf> a hacker, is the one who uses so computer knowledge in a playful way, for various non-perjudicial reasons
[00:41:06] <isf> that mean, install GNU operating system if they want
[00:41:27] <kompowiec> perjudicial or prejudice?
[00:41:29] <isf> never a hacker go to install nonfree software ofcourse!
[00:41:42] <isf> only dumbs install nonfree software
[00:41:58] <isf> if they know how to install free software, ofcourse
[00:42:10] <kompowiec> <isf> only dumbs install nonfree software
[00:42:13] <kompowiec> I am curious how this can be explained by normies
[00:42:39] <kompowiec> i tried, i just was called idiot and caveman
[00:42:40] <isf> i say perjudicial kompowiec
[00:42:43] <kompowiec> ok
[00:43:04] <Noisytoot> <isf> that is kick off the sentence of the context Noisytoot
[00:43:05] <Noisytoot> What do you mean?
[00:43:42] <isf> read 
[00:43:54] <isf> the complete context
[00:43:56] <Noisytoot> I cannot parse that sentence.
[00:44:08] <isf> I explain it this way, proprietary software mistreats the user. therefore you must install free software, because it is the only ethical way to oar computer
[00:44:56] <vivien> On the other hand, if you start to use and appreciate free software, you will lose all interest in doing destructive things.
[00:44:59] <isf> saying that a hacker is not who installs gnu is like saying that the hackers don't eat, because it's not a computer thing.
[00:45:07] <kompowiec> well i gives often innumerable examples that are ignored by the irrefutable argument pt. convenience.
[00:45:19] <kompowiec> s/pt./sweat by title/
[00:45:41] <isf> if they ignore the political, and ethical reasons show them the technical superior caracteristics
[00:45:43] <Noisytoot> I didn't say that hackers don't install GNU. I said that installing GNU/Linux ≠ being a hacker.
[00:45:53] <Noisytoot> Also 'perjudicial' isn't a word according to ispell.
[00:45:55] <isf> stop be technical
[00:46:01] <isf> read the context please Noisytoot
[00:46:15] <kompowiec> or that I am a conspiracy theorist eg. when i say about no privacy
[00:46:34] <kompowiec> <Noisytoot> Also 'perjudicial' isn't a word according to ispell.
[00:46:38] <isf> im not english native speaker, im trying to speak my ideas in other lenguague what arent my main, Noisytoot
[00:46:39] <kompowiec> does exists in diki.pl
[00:46:57] <isf> perjudicial, is spanish word 
[00:47:16] <kompowiec> strange, diki.pl it's english-polish dic
[00:47:52] <kompowiec> in any case, google translate couldn't translate it correctly for me and said it was something about the courts.

[00:47:53] <Noisytoot> word: perjudicial
[00:47:53] <Noisytoot> how about: per judicial, per-judicial, prejudicial
[00:48:00] <isf> perjudicial is like damage of a civic right

[01:03:13] <Kolev> Writing translation software is a big job. I am suspicious that free software does the actual translation part.
[01:03:23] <isf> and you can run your own server of libretranslate
[01:03:24] <Kolev> …unless it is Apertium on the back-end.

[01:05:34] <kompowiec> let's be hones, since google translate appeared, it has become a monopoly on the market. Before Before its appearance, I saw a lot of great (though still non-free) products that, on top of that, worked offline.
[01:05:46] <kompowiec> let's be honest*
[01:06:13] <isf> but libretranslate can be self hosted offline

[05:51:39] <DiffieHellman> I am aware. Most people have heard of free software, but sadly reffered to with terms like "open source" and "FOSS", so they don't have much chance to realize how things really are.

[05:52:30] <GNUHacker> yes, FOSS incluce "open source"
[05:52:51] <DiffieHellman> That's why I reject "FOSS" myself.
[05:53:04] <smlavine> I'd even say that most people haven't even heard of open source, or if they have, know it only vaguely as meaning that you have access to something
[05:53:54] <DiffieHellman> A fair percentage haven't heard of it, but most have, and those most aren't informed that there's actually 8 requirements
[05:54:48] <smlavine> Again, I really dispute the claim that most of the general public have an understanding of the term open source
[05:54:51] <GNUHacker> I also reject say FOSS/FLOSS
[05:55:28] <smlavine> Maybe that's something I'll do once back to university. Run a survey at the cafeterias, and ask people if they know the terms open source or free software, and to define them

I worded it that way, because I hypothesize that many people who have heard of open source may not associate it with the free software of the FSF or open source of the OSI, but with the vague idea of "open access" or "knowledge"
[05:57:39] <smlavine> Here's an example of what I mean. This series by Vox: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJ8cMiYb3G5eXhp_RaSKeGUs0YYb8XAKt
[05:58:15] <smlavine> In this context the term "open source" is just used with the connotation of pulling back the curtain to some topic

[06:42:13] <gothicserpent> kind of like the inverse of piracy, pirated titles can sometimes stim growth of the main branch, despite it being commercial.
[06:42:43] <DiffieHellman> smlavine: Apple requires that software on their app store be under a proprietary license as they hate freedom.

[07:08:39] <fossdev> If u really like normal people why not promote permissive license
[07:08:47] <anton> what standards does Windows have to match?
[07:08:49] <smlavine> gothicserpent is not a bad person just because they use windows. It is unfortunate that they have to do so and we should strive to build software so that doing so is not necessary
[07:09:07] <DiffieHellman> Certain versions of gcc can cross compile to windows, but no-one does that because there's not much point.
[07:09:34] <smlavine> fossdev: I hate to burst your bubble, but you are just as "normal" as anyone else in this world. Reading the GNU wikipedia article does not make you special
[07:09:35] <gothicserpent> DiffieHellman: with unreal engine unfortunately it doesn't work. clang only goes so far.

[07:10:04] <smlavine> gothicserpent: What game?
[07:10:04] <DiffieHellman> gothicserpent: You're trapped with a proprietary engine, you should escape.
[07:10:24] <DiffieHellman> I'm pretty sure godot should compile to windows and Android etc.

[07:11:46] <smlavine> Unfortunately for you, gothicserpent.com is easy to guess
[07:11:50] <isf> the right way to share ideas about free software, are the promotion of the ideas of freedom, which may or may not be through practical benefits, but always, the entry and exit of this promotion is through the promotion of libertarian ideas, comparing them with the DRM
[07:11:54] <gothicserpent> smlavine: SHUSH!!! LMAO
[07:12:00] * anton takes your halo and replaces it with an old computer disk platter
[07:12:59] * DiffieHellman looks at his halo and it's already a platter.
[07:13:01] <smlavine> I think that less worrying about the right ways to share ideas about free software, and more sharing ideas about free software, is better

[07:14:52] <fossdev> 13,99smlavine99,99: by helping normal user u more helping non free platform
[07:15:00] <isf> smlavine that's a mistake, because if you don't make a difference you won't get as much as possible.
[07:15:54] <gothicserpent> fossdev: one of them is a 6dof space sim, like descent from the 90s. the other is a platformer like mario, and finally i have a top-down roguelike bullet-hell type game similar to streets of rogue.
[07:15:57] <isf> another question is; how can we reach proprietary software users, if we are not on so platforms?
[07:16:03] <smlavine> fossdev: By making free software more accessible to normal users, we make them less dependent on non-free software, making the world a better place
[07:16:27] <fossdev> 13,99smlavine99,99: I choosed gnu nog because of freedom but because gcc does not work on windows
[07:16:36] <fossdev> not*
[07:16:42] <isf> that isnt a good reason fossdev
[07:16:48] <isf> but, is a reason
[07:17:03] <isf> the reason of exist of GNU is freedom.

[07:18:19] <smlavine> isf: What I mean is that, lots of people doing things differently rather that all following One True Way is better for two main reasons: a) People are different and are convinced differently, using different methods and strategies will naturally appeal to a greater variety of people, and b) everyone doing things the same way, with the same talking points looks like a cult. And nobody wants to join a cult

[08:13:53] <GoatAvenger> I don't know much about the history of clang..
[08:13:54] <DiffieHellman> gcc isn't going to die, proprietary companies are just moving to clang as you can make everything 100% proprietary if you use it,
[08:14:32] <tpefreedom> And then the linux kernel community is very corporate.
[08:14:48] <DiffieHellman> There's no reason to donate gcc to proprietary companies just because another compiler is.
[08:15:12] <DiffieHellman> Adding "kernel" after Linux is unneeded as we know that Linux is only a kernel.,
[08:16:31] <tpefreedom> normal linux vs linux-libre
[08:18:18] <tpefreedom> That statement about it being very corporate only applies to the community surrounding the main kernel. linux-libre's community is mostly FSF/GNU and the core free software movement rather than large corporations or the open source crowd afaik.
[08:19:35] <DiffieHellman> "linux developer community" is probably the most accurate.

[08:31:40] <DiffieHellman> Yes, but the developers don't really care
[08:31:43] <tpefreedom> s/undr/unnder/
[08:32:05] <DiffieHellman> Have a look at the huge Linux-libre patchset for where to look.,
[08:32:16] <clever> as a random example, a large chunk of the hw accel (h264 encode/decode) on the rpi, is just RPC calls into a blob that runs on another cpu core
[08:32:55] <clever> so even if you can boot linux without the blob (rpi-open-firmware and my fork and other work), you loose that hw accel
[08:33:04] <clever> the source isnt the entire story
[08:33:08] <tpefreedom> RPC makes me think of RiscPC, which is probably completely unrelated.
[08:33:35] <clever> tpefreedom: its a variant of a synopsys arc dsp
[08:34:41] <fossdev> So isn't most developer of linux don't care about freedom
[08:35:50] <DiffieHellman> Yes, otherwise Linux would be GPLv2+
[08:36:29] <fossdev> So why we can't move from linux
[08:36:54] <clever> my general goal with the open rpi firmware, is to be able to build a working system entirely from source
[08:37:31] <GoatAvenger> fossdev, need genius devs to kernel hack, and enough people to care to contribute.  That'd be my guess
[08:37:32] <tpefreedom> DiffieHellman, Wouldn't you have to get every single contributor (with copyright claims to their commits) on board in order to upgrade to v2+?
[08:37:33] <DiffieHellman> fossdev: Linux is currently the best existing kernel.
[08:37:39] <fossdev> Like hyperbolabsd
[08:38:05] <DiffieHellman> tpefreedom: If they really cared about freedom, they would have avoided the problem from the start.
[08:38:33] <clever> in the case of the rpi drivers, they where written by people that maintain the blobs
[08:38:46] <DiffieHellman> I myself wouldn't mind having to email every single contributer and getting the remaining replaced if it was possible.
[08:38:49] <clever> so they are on the wrong side, and have their hands tied by NDA's
[08:39:07] <DiffieHellman> Sadly Linus is stopping the GPLv3 no matter waht.
[08:39:20] <clever> but they have surprised me a few times, and released source for random chunks of the hw
[08:39:49] <tpefreedom> DiffieHellman, how? There wouldn't have been an obvious reason to assume that the GPL would have needed future versions at that point.
[08:39:59] <tpefreedom> *at the beginning
[08:40:05] <DiffieHellman> Yes, my point.
[08:40:25] <DiffieHellman> Wait, I read it wrong
[08:41:10] <DiffieHellman> It was known that the GPL would eventually need a future version as it was the second version after all.
[08:42:02] <tpefreedom> What happened with v1?

[08:55:29] <GoatAvenger> I've given monetary support to the ReactOS project
[08:55:44] <fossdev> One argument i see more often, it Gnu OS is really bloated and doesn't follow UNIX philosophy
[08:56:17] <epony> that is not a real problem, since there are BSD systems that follow sound engineering principles
[08:56:36] <epony> GNU is an extra userland and feature-complete layer, so it can do whatever it likes
[08:57:19] <epony> there is really no point criticising adherence to superstitious guidelines, the real thing are engineering and programming principles
[08:57:39] <tpefreedom> hi epony
[08:57:48] <epony> GNU just chooses to offer more than essential basics and that's fine, it just can't push these into standards
[08:58:32] <epony> also GNU is a convention and a programming set of de-facto methodologies for GNU extensions to that userland
[08:59:39] <epony> the serious problem is in "applications" and "desktop" environments, that create dependence on non-efficient or just wrong designs
[09:00:15] <fossdev> Ok that make sense but most developer don't like complexity so they move to bsd
[09:00:28] <epony> and the intentional disuse of Operating System provided services and sub-systems, and implementing these as a double computation for decreased quality and control
[09:00:33] <tpefreedom> What's an example of a design that you see as just wrong?
[09:00:54] <epony> that's a problem of large applications and application suites, like browsers, office suites, and platform-like applications
[09:01:14] <epony> a wrong design is "captive" an application-as-a-system
[09:01:42] <epony> the so called platformisation, is completely un-modular outside of that "lock-in"
[09:03:12] <epony> I see the opposite, most developers trying to outdo commercial 'fanfare' and 'featuritis' and claim it is "the best thing" while it just is "a bundle" of parts that do not integrate with anything else, but its own fix-mix
[09:03:56] <epony> so, if a browser tells you it's an operating system, that's pure bullshit

[09:05:20] <fossdev> 11,99epony99,99: that also include emacs
[09:06:27] <epony> yes, though emacs is special, in that it works with and on UNIX and POSIX
[09:07:04] *** Quits: awolf (~aaron@97-120-55-127.ptld.qwest.net) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[09:08:30] <fossdev> I tried OpenBSD and i am surprised that it is much simpler, follows standard
[09:08:33] <epony> while Firefox and Chromium are not special, they are simply not very useful in terms of the filtering and processing aspects, they are "end-of-compute" final stage for view and "save", don't do much processing and work, just decisions and primitive interactivity
[09:09:30] <fossdev> OpenBSD is also much more consistent than gnu
[09:09:33] <epony> OpenBSD is fantastic (very similar to NetBSD), so is FreeBSD too very useful, but the gem is OpenBSD, from that category, and they all provide the GNU userland as packages so anyone can use them and feel comfortable for user facing applications.
[09:10:46] <epony> we can't judge consistency that way, since GNU is not an operating system but a userland, it has no system internals, just implements POSIX-like utilities and toolchains and applications, which are doing more than POSIX covers and do own decisions..
[09:10:50] <epony> so not really comparable
[09:11:10] <epony> what you're comparing is the BSD userland and the GNU userlands in basic utilities..
[09:11:27] <fossdev> Yes
[09:12:34] <epony> while the systems underneath are respectively BSD UNIX and Linux and potentially others where GNU can run, e.g. cygnus/cygwin/windows/macos etc
[09:13:03] <epony> so obviously GNU not being UNIX is "correct" ;-)
[09:13:44] <epony> we can't judge it with the UNIX standardisation and principles and methodologies (although it tries to be similar and meaningful)
[09:14:06] *** Quits: skapata (~Skapata@user/skapata) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[09:14:19] <fossdev> Yes but i linked it more if it was more unix like
[09:14:27] <fossdev> linked*
[09:14:31] <epony> what is bad is "applications falling for the extra things and bad designs of captive and non-modular" interfaces (programming methodologies) and thus becoming unportable and captive themselves (network effect)
[09:14:44] <fossdev> liked*
[09:15:15] <epony> well, I personally like some of the decisions that GNU takes, but they are "extra" not "mandatory"
[09:15:46] <epony> both conventions are useful and must exist and be implemented and available so people have choice and independence
[09:16:11] <epony> the standard ones for portability, and the extra ones for convenience and more features (extensions)
[09:16:26] <epony> so, conventions are good and important
[09:17:28] *** Parts: mimi89999 (cb2cbfa643@83.24.101.118.ipv4.supernova.orange.pl) (Disconnected: Received SIGTERM)
[09:18:03] *** Joins: mimi89999 (cb2cbfa643@83.24.101.118.ipv4.supernova.orange.pl)
[09:18:16] <fossdev> For me convenience means portability
[09:18:26] <fossdev> Ans simplicity
[09:18:30] <epony> what's bad is "people becoming zealots" of one and condemning the other, especially from the side of teen proclamations and prepubescent vandalism
[09:18:50] *** Quits: dbristow (~dbristow@user/dbristow) (Remote host closed the connection)
[09:18:51] <epony> well, portability should be "sane" and "reliable" (sustainable)
[09:19:11] *** Joins: dbristow (~dbristow@user/dbristow)
[09:19:32] <epony> because Java virtual machines and language claims portability too, but we know how it ends (neither portable, nor system applicable) -> captivity and lawsuits
[09:20:32] <epony> many times simplicity is just "not-enough-people" or "we-can't-support-it", which is also a fallacy of "bold teen claims" from grown up people
[09:20:40] <epony> so, there is:
[09:20:46] <epony> Standardisation
[09:20:47] <epony> and
[09:20:49] <epony> Standards
[09:20:56] <epony> ;-)
[09:21:10] <epony> de-facto standards work too
[09:22:00] <epony> important principles to know and evaluate in application desings matter too, but they are not mandatory and are broken for captivity and public grab, that is a loss in time all the time (always)
[09:22:03] <fossdev> Nice, i am convinced
[09:22:23] <epony> so, applications are.. forgiving and.. forgetful.. and naive
[09:22:44] <fossdev> Very well explained
[09:23:05] <fossdev> Thanks
[09:23:07] <epony> but operating systems are NOT, so there is no compromise there, the level of reuse and scrutiny is absurdly high and mistakes are very very expensive for millions upon millions of people and work hours
[09:23:31] <epony> and can take years to more than decades to solve and fix
[09:24:39] <fossdev> That really make sence
[09:24:50] <epony> that's why programming applications start from the extremities of the system, some module or in-program addition, or shell utility (scripts in app / in sys tooling)
[09:25:28] <epony> and then gradually moves inwards with use and performance and reliability needs and usage weight on the respective task
[09:26:41] <epony> so, for applications people write add-ons and plug-ins but that is a mistake for programs that do not provide that to the rest of the system or have "captivity" goals and objectives (terminal stages of computing)
[09:27:22] <epony> while they really should be writing extensions to a modular application server and client model, or rather system components that can be operated from convenience interfaces
[09:28:48] <epony> and that is where application construction toolkits come into play, and where the principles again become meaningful and important
[09:29:17] <epony> so, that is for "toolkits" and 'toolchains' and system and application programming frameworks
[09:29:43] <epony> there you must again have these, or they are superceded by better ones that have them
[09:31:00] <epony> one more thing, bloat is bad, only if it results in degraded qualities of the system, and typically it does, because otherwise it would be called standardisation of system and application components
[09:31:01] *** Quits: trekkie1701c (~trekkie17@user/trekkie1701c) (Quit: :P)
[09:31:43] <epony> when GNU utils and applications stick to GNU guidelines, they are like an extended de-facto standards-like conventions and specs
[09:31:47] <epony> so, that's good
[09:32:13] <epony> with years and many people working, things get perfected or reimplemented
[09:32:49] <epony> badness is "reusable-single-vendor" bulk-garbage like OpenSSL and similar
[09:33:34] <epony> the GNU or BSD variant of that, should be eliminating these bad points over time..
[09:33:58] <epony> meaning, from the software houses, not "themed by the licensing branding"
[09:34:45] <epony> so, be critical to components, libraries, modules, languages, application servers, system applications, and system internals
[09:36:12] <epony> and avoid captivity / lock-in and intentional restrictions by "unportable" designed application and system frameworks (desktop libraries and widgets being the primary offender)
[09:37:53] <epony> as, for system management utils, there is POSIX/SUS/XOPEN/etc and "own extra" that each distributive packages by some weird internal preferences of the people involved typically, worse in commercial and no-developers repackagers
[09:39:27] <epony> I like the GNU ;-) I don't like the licensing quarrels and rejection of work being reusable and "exemplary" quality between free software houses and amateur groups
[09:40:06] <epony> and I disapprove of and simply condemn lawsuits and forced dependence and forced services
[09:41:12] <epony> hence commerce and commerce-like exploitive practices are really absurd, coming from free software groups, that is a point of shame and dishonesty, that should not be even available for discussion (forgotten)
[09:42:29] <epony> the GNU is ethical enough, it just does not always remove the restrictions for some components it thinks are more "important" and "reusable" or "key" to their releases (e.g. multi-licensing on various toolchains and compiler internals and different licensing for different usage / reusers)
[09:43:19] <clever> > < epony> what's bad is "people becoming zealots"
[09:43:22] <epony> which other groups do not or can not accept, and are thus limited in their "use of modern" things coming out from the GNU house with these less permissive licensing versions / variants
[09:43:39] <clever> epony: ive had people almost attacking me for using github for code hosting and youtube for demo video hosting
[09:44:15] <epony> well, hopefully you meet / talk to better people ;-)
[09:44:45] <clever> most of what ive been doing has been replacing the blobs on the rpi
[09:44:56] <epony> GH is a liability / risk for the free software communities and groups, only if it is used for serious projects, and it's not used by neither GNU or BSD groups
[09:45:24] <epony> so, downstream or extremity application-like extras living on GH is "nothing"
[09:45:32] <clever> epony: how is it a risk? the only thing i can really loose is the issue/pr comments
[09:45:48] <epony> it is a risk, because GH is not free
[09:45:52] <clever> everything of value is in the git history, and can be pushed to another service in seconds
[09:46:05] <epony> it's a commercial service for gratis which is a HUGE risk
[09:46:27] <epony> that's why GNU and BSD self-host everything for their development, hosting and mail communications
[09:46:37] <clever> yeah, i am paying for github pro for private repos, so i dont have to worry about hosting backups of stuff i havent touched in decades
[09:46:50] <epony> and the GH is just a social "also published there" for views and giggles mostly
[09:47:24] <epony> GH is temporary, remember GC (google code)?
[09:47:40] <epony> you should remember it and be scared about your setups on GH
[09:48:00] <epony> it's not a good investment, but that's your choice.. nobody but you care about that ;-)
[09:48:30] <clever> except for the people that tell me to jump ship every time i link my github repo :P
[09:48:38] <GoatAvenger> the reason not to use github, to me, is simple.  1: it's microsoft owned.  2: Microsoft's co-pilot AI is hoovering up all source code and will possibly use it in proprietary software it claims is unique and doesn't violate licenses
[09:49:08] <epony> some conservative and central review and approve systems do not even consider DVCS a meaningful thing other than "own use" and "outsider view"
[09:49:52] <clever> GoatAvenger: that brings up another thing i'm kind of on the edge of, a license that says all changes must also be open source, is kind of taking some freedom away from the editor
[09:50:00] <epony> so, git is just "what the Linus' kernel" needed for his own model of maintenance and upkeep (huge project by irreconcileable groups)
[09:50:16] <clever> > VASM requires a small patch in order to work but since the license does not allow redistribution of modifications, I cannot include it, but to summarise in the VideoCore cpu.c file, in translate the handler for for 48 bit arithmetic instructions needs to have the first conditional commented out (the one that checks if the instruction number is less than 32).
[09:50:21] <epony> GH is like FB, it's for getting lols and duds
[09:50:42] <GoatAvenger> clever, I'm not completely certain I know what you mean..
[09:50:43] <clever> GoatAvenger: it can lead to a mess like this, where your license isnt compatible, and you cant even include a .patch file, so you have to describe the patch in english, lol

[09:51:34] <epony> cause real software houses reject GH
[09:51:34] <clever> GoatAvenger: if i use a license that requires all changes/forks to also be open source, then the people editing my code are not free to maintain private forks
[09:52:07] <GoatAvenger> clever, private forks?  Sure they can, if it's private.  No?
[09:52:17] <epony> and only small commerce and noob individuals or small teams get "trapped" on a GH factory floor without elevators
[09:52:40] <clever> GoatAvenger: but if the license says that they must release source with any binaries in a finished product, that private fork would be illegal
[09:53:00] <GoatAvenger> clever, well, it they release something, it's not private anymore..?
[09:53:08] <GoatAvenger> clever, then the license is applicable to the work
[09:53:29] <clever> more, if they want to release that fork in a binary only form
[09:53:51] <GoatAvenger> clever, well, then you prefer, bsd-type license; I would think?

[09:54:15] <clever> bsd gives the editors more freedom
[09:54:24] <GoatAvenger> clever, minix is lax-permissive, and was used as a base for the Intel Management Engine; which, arguably, denies a lot of people a lot of liberty
[09:54:28] <clever> but removing that freedom puts more code out in the public
[09:54:37] <epony> MSFT and AAPL have been doing this for 40 years..
[09:54:54] <GoatAvenger> clever, So, that's a debatable position.  If for example, BSD is used to power government over-reach, abuses, etc..  
[09:55:05] <GoatAvenger> things of that nature
[09:55:21] <epony> stealing and reselling people's work, at disparity and unfair reproduction qualities and extracting monster profits from that, you can't shut the mouths of suckers who want fast food
[09:55:52] <epony> you can just release good things as recipes and produce and materials for people to get their own food replicators

[09:56:14] <clever> GoatAvenger: the main case where ive run into it causing other problems, is that https://github.com/littlekernel/lk is bsd based, but i have gpl based changes i'm merging in, and upstream cant accept them
[09:56:34] <GoatAvenger> clever, I was of the opposition that bsd type licenses, preserver the freedom to choose not to be free; but, so does the GPL perserve that choice, you do so by (not using the software: ie: choosing not to be free)

[09:57:23] <clever> GoatAvenger: but LK also has a build system that allows you to easily overlay a directory over the source, so i can maintain https://github.com/librerpi/lk-overlay and not have to rebase things constantly

[09:58:28] <epony> just don't give them money ;-) if you want less of a guilty conscience
[09:58:57] <GoatAvenger> clever, hmm, well I'm no expert on such matters, or an expert of much of anything.  I haven't really wrote enough code to encounter licensing issues.
[09:59:18] <GoatAvenger> clever, I would think you would just make the changes conform to the license of littlekernel..
[09:59:27] <GoatAvenger> clever, but all that's beyond me
[09:59:48] <epony> it enough that software houses that produce major software projects and systems know and care about that, the rest is pointless concerns
[10:00:07] <clever> GoatAvenger: but some of those changes are just copy/pasting from a gpl codebase, so the copy should also become gpl?
[10:00:28] <epony> "whatever" ;-)
[10:00:45] <GoatAvenger> clever, I do not have such answers...
[10:00:57] <clever> large chunks of lk-overlay came from either https://github.com/christinaa/rpi-open-firmware or the rpi fork of linux
[10:01:07] <epony> GH is not a licensing "watchdog" but you can bet it will become
[10:01:35] <clever> epony: only after they solve the issue of co-pilot shoving gpl code into a bsd project, lol

[10:02:50] <epony> shove whatever you like in your whatever you host your thing..
[10:03:26] <epony> now, once we declared GH shitty and worthless ;-) we can talk about something more fun
[10:03:35] <clever> my goal has mostly just been to get the rpi booting linux, with the ability to point to source and compile directions if you name any binary in the system
[10:03:47] <clever> so you can edit the source and build your own binary
[10:04:14] <epony> repos do that thing, change things, if they have that in their list of objectives
[10:04:32] <epony> obviously the hosting at GNU or BSD projects is a "safe" house

[11:52:40] <DiffieHellman> gothicserpent: SSL is very insecure and depreciated. Did you mean TLS?
[11:52:58] <DiffieHellman> The one wireguard guy knows what he's doing.
[11:53:25] <DiffieHellman> ChaCha is an excellent encryption algo.

[11:53:33] <gothicserpent> yeah chacha20
[11:53:53] <DiffieHellman> Lets encrypt pretty much just signs your TLS cert.

[11:57:34] <epony> wg is a one-man show
[11:57:43] <DiffieHellman> fossdev: You pretty much just have to generate a root signing cert, then sign intermities with that.
[11:58:25] <DiffieHellman> With those intermities, you can then sign whatever TLS certs you want.
[11:58:36] <epony> gothicserpent, those were reusable public implementations
[11:58:45] <gothicserpent> epony: you would agree wireguard is better than openvpn?
[11:58:59] <DiffieHellman> The problem is, peoples browsers need to have your root cert installed to trust your signature.
[11:59:12] <epony> gothicserpent, I don't use either.
[11:59:17] <fossdev> 4,99DiffieHellman99,99: But how i become trusted one, so each browser knows my authority
[11:59:44] <fossdev> Yea exactly
[11:59:50] <gothicserpent> my vpn provider, mullvad, kept praising wireguard for years in their blog posts so i finally switched a week ago. not bad.
[12:00:14] <DiffieHellman> fossdev: You pretty much have to get an existing CA to cross sign your root until you get large enough that your root is added to browsers.
[12:00:52] <fossdev> 4,99DiffieHellman99,99: So their is no real solution.
[12:01:07] <fossdev> I expected that

[12:09:16] <DiffieHellman> If you have someone's correct public key and you encrypt your message, then no-one else but the person with th private key can read the message.
[12:09:33] <DiffieHellman> PGP is most commonly used for email.,
[12:10:28] <DiffieHellman> The drawback of PGP is that it doesn't have perfect forward secrecy. If an attacker gets the private key, the attacker can read any encrypted message that they have.

[23:34:10] <epony> you have to run a course of operating systems 10 times for 10 years to get that fixed
[23:34:34] <epony> get a book, stop repeating silly claims
[23:35:10] <epony> you have no idea what an operating system is ;-)

[23:54:20] <White_Flame> and that is one definiton of many
[23:54:31] <White_Flame> *out of many
[23:54:47] <natewrench123456> a computer is as complicated as the human brain
[23:55:18] <White_Flame> obviously, the linux ecosystem has added the additional term "distribution"

[23:56:16] <epony> natewrench123456, wrong, the computer is nowhere near as complicated as mamallian brains
[23:56:59] <White_Flame> more importantly, the (modern) computer is way more of a complex and integrated multi-system system than the simple models describe
[23:57:28] <natewrench123456> is it possible to reconstruct a computer from scratch without going through say intel?
[23:57:37] <White_Flame> "reconstruct"?
[23:57:51] <White_Flame> but yeah, you can build whatever you want out of just logic chips, and people still do as hobbies
[23:58:00] <White_Flame> or go grab an FPGA and do a lot
[23:58:08] <epony> you can construct a computer from simple logical elements, it just would not be very advanced integration device
[23:58:24] <White_Flame> neither Intel nor x86/x64 are required
[23:58:46] <White_Flame> but you're still generally going to be purchasing somebody's fabbed chips
[23:58:53] <natewrench123456> Theres tons of gnu linux distros but few freedom hardware
[23:59:01] <White_Flame> now, if you want to do relays or whatever, you can avoid ICs
[23:59:04] <epony> however are used, because of efficiency and computational density for affordable modular singe computer systems
[23:59:53] <natewrench123456> thats why i want purism to succeed with their libre hardware platforms
[23:59:53] <epony> there is no N+1 definitions of an operating system, those are misreadings and opinions of people who do not know what an operating system is
