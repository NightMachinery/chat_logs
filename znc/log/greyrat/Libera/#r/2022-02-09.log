[00:06:35] <fendur> submitted!
[00:07:17] <rickyrick> wat
[00:07:23] <confuzeus> once came across a tidy presentation where they mentioned how one can store other objects including data.frames inside of data.frames and how that was very powerful!
[00:07:43] * rickyrick stores fitted model objects in a data frame of model parameter combinations
[00:08:51] <Bayes> do you really rickyrick
[00:08:58] <rickyrick> ya
[00:09:09] <Bayes> is that a sane thing?
[00:09:12] <rickyrick> idk
[00:09:23] <rickyrick> I just %>% rowwise %>% mutate(modelmetrics = modelmetrics(model))
[00:09:32] <rickyrick> Then I have a data frame with each parameter combination and associated metrics
[00:09:53] <Bayes> what's modelmetrics return type?
[00:10:00] <rickyrick> A named vector
[00:10:16] <Bayes> ah so you end up with a data.frame
[00:10:19] <fendur> rickyrick: is there a benefit that yuo don't get by just using a list?
[00:10:20] <rickyrick> c(ARI = 0.9, BIC = 1234, ICL = 1234)
[00:10:37] <Bayes> yeah you end up with a data.frame(par1, par2, par3, ari, bic, icl)
[00:10:42] <rickyrick> Not much :^)
[00:11:05] <Bayes> I do the same except I return lists, cause I can data.frame them but also nested them, lapply them, etc
[00:11:05] <rickyrick> Mostly if I want to pick out a model with min BIC or max ARI I can just filter()
[00:11:21] <rickyrick> Then pick out the fitted model object without having to match indices from the model metrics to the list
[00:11:57] <Bayes> but where do you store the fitted model object? in a separate list?
[00:12:08] <rickyrick> List-column in a tibble
[00:12:14] <rickyrick> or data frame
[00:12:22] <Bayes> o.o ok
[00:12:24] <rickyrick> But mostly tibble because it prints it out as just <list> instead of dumping the contents
[00:12:35] <Bayes> ah I defaulted to str(x, 1) at this point
[00:12:42] <rickyrick> Yeah that too :^)
[00:16:01] <Bayes> trying to imagine how that would work with a data frame
[00:18:17] <Bayes> kinda crazy that this works http://ix.io/3P4i
[00:18:34] <Bayes> I mean I get why it works but... never thought of storing objects in a data.frame just to keep the indexing
[00:18:55] <Bayes> ive never used tibbles either
[00:19:37] <rickyrick> I would use DF$loess <- in the second line
[00:20:20] <Bayes> yeah now I get it
[00:20:46] <Bayes> I'm struggling to flatten the data frame I showed above
[00:20:57] <Bayes> it's crazy how much trouble this is giving me xd
[00:25:39] <rickyrick> You mean the one with embedded matrices
[00:27:23] <Bayes> yeah I had to do do.call(data.frame, as.list(ydSPDF0@data))
[00:27:29] <Bayes> to get a "flattened" dataframe
[00:27:37] <rickyrick> Yeah there was some simple one-liner
[00:27:45] <rickyrick> idk if your method preserves names
[00:27:49] <Bayes> it does
[00:27:53] <rickyrick> neat.r
[00:28:06] <Bayes> lol
[00:28:41] <rickyrick> Google seems to think the correct spelling of data frame is dataframe
[00:31:03] <Bayes> imagine if we had DF[, re'pattern'] for DF[, grep(pattern, names(DF))]
[00:31:23] <rickyrick> DF %>% select(contains(pattern))?
[00:31:41] <Bayes> I mean using base R right
[00:31:54] <Bayes> so I don't need to load a package for something I use one place somewhere in my code :P
[00:32:08] <rickyrick> :^)
[00:33:36] <Bayes> rickyrick do you know if there's a more or less homogeneous class of ML models compiled in a package a la scikit ?
[00:33:46] <rickyrick> caret
[00:33:52] <Bayes> not caret or others that are like interfaces
[00:34:04] <rickyrick> I don't think so
[00:34:14] <Bayes> AFAIK scikit is not an interface but they have a homogeneous implementation I think ?
[00:34:31] <Bayes> there's mlr3
[00:34:34] <rickyrick> Is there a difference from gluing all the packages together and calling it one package?
[00:34:54] <rickyrick> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[00:35:11] <Bayes> well...
[00:35:25] <Bayes> I'd rather depend on one thing instead of hundreds
[00:35:28] <Bayes> but that's personal
[00:35:53] <rickyrick> :^)
[00:36:11] <rickyrick> Guess you don't follow the UNIX philosophy
[00:36:17] <Bayes> I do
[00:36:21] <Bayes> except for R xD
[00:36:21] <mefistofeles> fuck the UNIX philosophy
[00:36:24] * mefistofeles hides
[00:36:25] <rickyrick> ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
[00:36:36] <Bayes> and I've been downsizing quite a bit on the OS side
[00:36:57] <Bayes> arch + emacs + i3 = 97% of the software I use
[00:37:13] <Bayes> it's quite cool when you find a few dependable things
[00:37:22] <mefistofeles> nice, I use arch + plasma + pycharm... bloated as fuck, but I like it
[00:37:31] <mefistofeles> it does the job quite well
[00:37:32] <Bayes> heh
[00:37:42] <rickyrick> I couldn't get used to KDE
[00:37:55] <Bayes> yeah emacs + i3 is 99% as light as it gets
[00:38:09] <Bayes> though I do understand that emacs is a bit not enough for actual soft dev
[00:38:21] <Bayes> so pycharm is probably a more than reasonable addition to the combo
[00:38:42] <rickyrick> Was pycharm electron yet
[00:39:07] <mefistofeles> no
[00:39:11] <mefistofeles> Java + Qt
[00:39:17] <rickyrick> Could be worse
[00:39:21] <Bayes> heh
[00:39:33] <Bayes> Qt is actually... fine?
[00:39:36] <mefistofeles> Bayes: I used to be vim + i3
[00:39:41] <rickyrick> Qt is okay
[00:39:45] <mefistofeles> but I just learn it doesn't fit my workflow
[00:39:53] <rickyrick> Just have to pay to get the good stuff now
[00:40:01] <Bayes> rickyrick really ??
[00:40:13] <Bayes> I thought they were charging for the editor or some
[00:40:17] <rickyrick> They went commercial :^)
[00:40:18] <Bayes> qt3 creator or whatever the same was
[00:40:33] <rickyrick> Yeah something like that
[00:42:33] <Bayes> mefistofeles what is it that didn't fit your workflow? is it vim being a text editor and you needing something closer to an ide?
[00:43:23] <mefistofeles> yeah having to be actually reconfiguring stuff to support new things, or setup new plugins/extensions and then fiddle with the config for hours to get them to work , etc..
[00:43:26] <mefistofeles> it gets tiring
[00:43:30] <mefistofeles> same kinda holds for i3
[00:43:33] <Bayes> hm
[00:43:36] <Bayes> see what you mean
[00:43:45] <Bayes> I enjoy tweaking arch and emacs and i3
[00:44:01] <Bayes> it's fun procrastination
[00:44:07] <Bayes> kills ur productivity tho lol
[00:44:16] <mefistofeles> I like things to be integrated, even if that means "bloated"... I don't enjoy much having to make 3rd party things work together and spending hours doing that
[00:44:23] <mefistofeles> I used to, but I'm just not there anymore :P
[00:45:00] <mefistofeles> I guess I'm old, but mostly it's that I'm really tired of technology, it doesn't impress me nowadays and it isn't as fun as it used to be
[00:47:22] <Bayes> heh
[00:47:23] <Bayes> that's fine
[00:47:45] <Bayes> I'm dreading the day I get a job that won't let me tweak much with my setup
[00:49:49] <since_> Windows
[00:49:56] <mefistofeles> Bayes: from my experience the trick is separating both
[00:50:17] <mefistofeles> for your personal stuff, fiddle and tweak as much as you want
[00:50:24] <mefistofeles> for work, kinda the opposite
[00:50:39] <mefistofeles> then profit!... happiness!!
[00:51:12] <mefistofeles> of course, everybody has a balance, but I'm trying to minimize what I have to tweak to do my work
[00:51:28] <mefistofeles> specially now that everything is homogeneous and going to the cloud
[00:51:43] <mefistofeles> doesn't make much sense to fight against that, will only put more load on you

[02:06:46] <nvuafo> confuzeus: Could be. I'm just searching for a general way to do it. Like say f(x,y)=x+y, what's a way to produce a table based on the row index and column index of the table. So like second column, third row would have entry f(2,3)=5
[02:07:04] <nvuafo> , as an example.
[02:17:30] <confuzeus> i am not sure i am following your example. the most common data structure is the data.frame (which is like an excel sheet i.e. 2d rows/columns). so, there are functions to work data in x,y cells. your example appear to be one that would require a custom function achieved by function(). for data.frame stored data some functions of interest may include apply, aggregate, ave, tapply, table, tabulate,...

[18:18:39] <fendur> to my knowledge, our cluster doesn't even have solid guarantees.

[18:19:01] <Bayes> hm
[18:19:02] <fendur> actually, i think AWS can do better in terms of a guarantee

[18:24:24] <Bayes> oh nice
[18:24:35] <Bayes> the one you mentioned a while ago that you were using jags cause discrete parameters?
[18:24:41] <fendur> exactly
[18:24:45] <Bayes> gotcha
[18:25:54] <Bayes> you know i've been spinning 352 cores at full speed for... hmm three weeks so far
[18:26:03] <fendur> i never did try to implement in Stan with an approximation for the discrete parameter
[18:26:09] <fendur> yikes!
[18:26:09] <Bayes> and what I'm finding is that, prediction wise at least, MAP = MCMC
[18:26:39] <Bayes> so in the end... it's making me reconsider a few things you know :P
[18:27:46] <fendur> uh huh
[18:27:53] <fendur> that's a lot of time and heat
[18:29:16] <fendur> gotta be some papers on this, no? seems like an important thing a lot of people learn the hard way.
[18:32:52] <Bayes> I know in this field you have both teams, team optimization and team MCMC, but I'm not aware of any paper that addresses this
[18:33:20] <Bayes> from a practical point of view, many are more than fine with an empirical bayes approach even
[18:33:32] <Bayes> or... even simpler, maximize the loglik and assume your model is bayesian anyway
[18:40:16] <Bayes> I wonder how much of a general statement you can make about map vs mcmc, at least for prediction

[19:25:56] <resistor4u> in https://bookdown.org/csgillespie/efficientR/programming.html the note box at section 3.2.1
[19:26:28] <resistor4u> advises to pre-allocate mem. for dataframes and "never grow an object." 
[19:27:23] <resistor4u> does loading a .Rdata file rather than loading dataset and then manipulating it satisfy this advice?
[19:28:27] <Bayes> I guess if you load a data frame directly, instead of creating it, you're bypassing all the concerns of possibly inefficient memory handling at creation
[19:29:40] <resistor4u> so does that mean read.csv() loads the data frame directly, or loading a Rdata object ?
[19:29:48] <resistor4u> sorry awkwardly put
[19:29:53] <Bayes> uhm idk about that
[19:30:11] <Bayes> read.csv is quite slow tbf
[19:30:46] <Bayes> but the Rdata can be compressed or uncompressed, so when you read it you might need to account for extraction time
[19:31:01] <resistor4u> hmm
[19:31:02] <Bayes> that said, both should have the same memory footprint once the data has been read
[19:31:18] <Bayes> 1. what's your data file size, 2. what's your specific concern?
[19:33:26] <resistor4u> 1) varies b/w 68kb and 1.1mb ; 2) trying to learn how to optimize my code and best way to make use of .Rdata files (after having ignored it all up to this point)
[19:35:00] <Bayes> xD
[19:35:07] <Bayes> ok 1mb is ok for whatever approach you take
[19:35:21] <Bayes> read.csv is fine
[19:35:38] <Bayes> and after that, just make sure you don't "grow your objects" by reallocating them
[19:36:04] <resistor4u> kk
[19:36:10] <resistor4u> thanks
[19:36:11] <Bayes> x <- c(1, 2); for (i in 1:10) { x <- c(x, i) }
[19:36:16] <Bayes> that's the kind of thing you want to avoid
[19:37:18] <Bayes> similarly, DF <- mtcars; for (i in 1:10) { DF <- cbind(DF, "newcol" = i) }
[19:37:40] <Bayes> cause the latter might at each step copy the old DF and create a whole new one
[19:37:43] <resistor4u> i think i'm allergic to `{`
[19:37:58] <Bayes> instead of just adding an extra list to the original data frame
[19:43:14] <fendur> Bayes: couldn't you approximate map by taking the mode of the samples drawn from MCMC?
[19:43:38] <fendur> (not that anyone would do that, just asking if there's an equivalence there)
[19:44:09] <Bayes> heh I once had a discussion with somebody bayesplaning me "that's not a MAP"
[19:44:17] <Bayes> while I was holding exactly that point
[19:44:42] <Bayes> that you could get an approximate for map by taking the highest log posterior sample
[19:44:55] <Bayes> so, I agree, pedantics may not :P
[19:45:50] <fendur> seems plausible though that the model of some combination of parameters may not be the same as the combination of modes
[19:45:56] <fendur> s/model/mode/
[19:47:04] <Bayes> I mean the fact that a posterior expectation for some arbitrary statistic via MAP and MCMC need not be the same is pretty clear to me
[19:47:21] <Bayes> what it's not clear to me is when those can be approximately the same
[19:47:34] <Bayes> in those cases, you can just MAP your problem out
[19:47:35] <fendur> yeah gotcha
[19:47:52] <Bayes> unlesssss you really want to have things beyond the posterior expectation for your arbitrary statistic
