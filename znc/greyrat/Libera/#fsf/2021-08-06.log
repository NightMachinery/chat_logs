[00:04:02] <Guest5395> I don't understand how
[00:04:03] <Guest5395> "The people who run the install fest should ask some users what the devil did to their computers"
[00:04:03] <Guest5395> could have been put into practice  at the time the original article was written

[00:04:59] <monkwitdafunk> Well i use the dexcom G6 cgm
[00:05:48] <Guest5395> @ggoes That's why I don' understand what was RMS suggesting at that time with that sentence

[00:09:25] <ggoes> i mean, they are powerless to the degree that they use proprietary software, where that software is concerned
[00:10:29] <Guest5395> @ggoes  Yes I agree with your wording. It sounds better
[00:11:04] <Guest5395> Ẃe, the users should find the most efficient way to use our power.
[00:11:21] <monkwitdafunk> I have to use windows 10 but at least mitigate its use for only business i trust
[00:13:27] <monkwitdafunk> I said i use the dexcom G6, a part to the tandem t slim which together becomes an artificial pancreas
[00:14:25] <Guest5395> monkwitdafunk I believe we should focus our power in trying to increase the critical mass of OS approved by the FSF.
[00:14:32] <monkwitdafunk> It is not 3rd generation bionic pancreas where you close the loop
[00:15:14] <Guest5395> of users of OS approved by the FSF
[00:15:16] <btdmaster> there are some interesting cross-platform programs like https://github.com/DexcTrack/dexctrack
[00:16:07] <Guest5395> sorry for the grammar mistake in my before last entry. I tried to correct it in the last one.
[00:16:07] <btdmaster> they may not be of any use to your case though
[00:16:10] <monkwitdafunk> Yes but to climb the ladder for freedom, it should be easy for the person to adopt like one laptop per child
[00:17:51] <mkulko> wait someone actually uses OLPC laptops to this day?

[00:29:30] <monkwitdafunk> Holy smokes
[00:30:08] <ggoes> alright, i think we can get rolling
[00:30:39] <ggoes> so, today's meeting is about the final two steps on the ladder - learning how to find help, and trying a free operating system
[00:31:04] <ggoes> (this isn't the last meeting total, but the last for this phase; after which we'll go back to the drawing board and incorporate everyone's comments)
[00:31:09] <monkwitdafunk> I would like to think that i need something i can keep in a bug out bag
[00:31:59] <ggoes> we thought it was important to teach / enable people how to find help for the problems / questions they might have on how to use free software before encouraging them to take the plunge and install gnu/linux. i think we all know stories of people who switched for a bit, then got too confused and switched back to whatever nonfree OS they were using before
[00:32:49] <mkulko> okay thanks ggoes. thinking about trying a libre os the first thing that comes to mind is my acer aspire 3 with undisableable secure boot that only boots windows D:
[00:33:00] <ggoes> we can't count on the person who helps them along the freedom ladder to be there for 24/7 tech support, although i know some free software activists like to do that with their friends and family. me included
[00:33:05] <ggoes> mkulko: yeah, that's worrying
[00:33:31] <btdmaster> if you want to, and the BIOS allows you to, you can disable secure boot
[00:33:58] <ggoes> i think in that case, with an unsolveable problem like that (i.e. if the BIOS totally does not let you do that), the recommendation is just to use as much free software as possible on your nonfree OS until you're in a position to transition to a new device
[00:34:04] <Noisytoot> zleap, Have you reported the issue?
[00:34:57] <Noisytoot> ggoes, I think it needs to allow you to be Windows certified
[00:35:08] <Noisytoot> (allow you to disable secure boot)
[00:35:14] <btdmaster> though there are some linux distros that are signed with Microsoft's keys, and so work with secure boot enabled
[00:35:16] <mkulko> ggoes: yep, my first libre os was debian and at first it was confusing as hell. i think we should strongly advise downloading an os like trisquel (it even works with native resolution on my amd r370 without blobs, no complicated setup needed!)

[00:37:25] <ggoes> yeah mkulko, i agree; the easier the better (in terms of use)
[00:38:10] <btdmaster> it's kind of sad that security is being used as an excuse for locking down devices

[00:38:23] <zleap> ggoes, it has to be easier, most users are not technical
[00:38:30] <tejr> I think better documentation for BIOS flashing that breaks down instructions by your model of computer are needed
[00:38:37] <monkwitdafunk> I just wish to boot toram the gnu linux and have hardware firewall
[00:38:41] <tejr> Even for technical people, it's a bit intimidating
[00:38:44] <zleap> not their fault, they are end users
[00:38:45] <ggoes> i should mention that at least in our initial conception "trying a free operating system" does not necessarily mean an FSDG distro.
[00:39:02] <zleap> tejr, yeah,  i found that with this,  never had this issue before on my old e-machines
[00:39:17] <ggoes> hopefully there's a more experienced free software person in this scenario helping someone move up the ladder, who can gauge how successful they're going to be with an FSDG distro
[00:39:18] <zleap> i just wanted to try out openmediavault as network attached storage
[00:39:30] <ggoes> they should at least try, but know that it might not work, and more importantly the reasons why it might not work
[00:39:38] <ggoes> the whole deal with the devil thing is something we can bring into that context
[00:40:14] <lxo> one of the issues with getting help with the ladder is getting advice that steers you away from the path to freedom.  ISTM it would be desirable to recommend/build "safe spaces" to get help, where people are more likely to offer advice aligned with the ideas behind the free software movement and the ladder
[00:40:19] <tejr> ggoes: I have had far too many disappointing turnabouts when encouraging someone to install Debian where I have had to point them to the ISOs with the non free firmware
[00:40:47] <tejr> The FSF not endorsing Debian I think is still one of the biggest missed opportunities in its history
[00:41:00] <Noisytoot> tejr, they won't endorse Debian because of non-free
[00:41:03] <ggoes> lxo: that makes sense. whether in person or digital (trisquel user forums are generally good)
[00:41:12] <tejr> Noisytoot: I understand why
[00:41:14] <zleap> Noisytoot, non free is part of unofficial
[00:41:28] <lxo> now, one of the challenges about having such spaces of progression is that what's a step forward for some is a step backwards for others
[00:41:30] <Noisytoot> I think it's sometimes recommended by the free installer
[00:41:49] <zleap> tyou can add non-free manually 
[00:42:02] <zleap> which you may need to for some software / hardware / firmware support
[00:42:10] <btdmaster> zleap: does that device support MBR? openmediavault seems to support both legacy and UEFI
[00:42:14] <ggoes> right. i think one problem might be if someone is willing to accept nonfree firmware etc on their first computer running free software, they will also be willing to accept it on their second. we need to encourage them to try and move forward rather than stagnate, or move backward
[00:42:41] <ggoes> especially when it comes to device firmware, as hopefully by this point they aren't using more complex nonfree programs
[00:42:41] <zleap> btdmaster, not sure, it supports booting with lilo and grub, both fail
[00:42:52] <zleap> there is a suggestion that part of the efi support is buggy
[00:43:06] <btdmaster> is there an option to force-disable efi?
[00:43:20] <tejr> It's increasingly important to explain why WSL isn't good enough, I keep hearing it from people who really should know better
[00:43:26] <Guest5395> Hi adfeno. I received your email.
[00:43:31] <zleap> btdmaster, no idea, I am not technical enough to understand all that, i can't even find efi in the bios
[00:43:41] <tejr> The same people who believe "Microsoft <3 Linux" to be sincere
[00:43:52] <ggoes> yeah tejr WSL is problematic. i'm not really sure if we should go into that on the ladder or not. maybe as a first taste of gnu/linux, sure, but not as a desirable place to remain for a while
[00:43:54] *** Quits: dot0 (~dot0@user/dot0) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[00:44:13] <monkwitdafunk> I think the freedom ladder is urgent
[00:44:23] <tejr> I think it might be a good idea to at least mention it
[00:44:30] <ggoes> oh definitely
[00:44:30] <zleap> ggoes, we don't want to imply WSL is anywhere near GNU / Linux in what we want people to run here
[00:44:31] *** Joins: dot0 (~dot0@user/dot0)
[00:44:34] <ggoes> zleap: correct
[00:44:42] <ggoes> i think it's totally fine and even good to use it as a way to become familiar with gnu/linux on a nonfree OS
[00:44:47] <tejr> Cool, thank you for that
[00:44:50] <ggoes> but nothing close to a "goal" state
[00:44:55] <btdmaster> it might not be awful though, iirc there was a post on HN that it persuaded /someone/ to migrate to linux
[00:45:06] <mkulko> ggoes: yeah but then its the problem that someone bought a fancy and very powerful new computer, then they understand and accept the devil, then when its time to buy a new one they will be disappointed to know that it's either those terrible (subjective opinion) old thinkpads or overpriced intel workstation or ibm hardware. that might be a reason that they will install the devil on their new computer also

[00:45:59] <ggoes> so the ideal outcome in my mind is: hopefully at that point they'll have learned the importance of freedom, and that will motivate them to be okay with a less powerful machine etc if it means retaining their freedom

[00:46:40] <btdmaster> also, if WSL is relevant, cygwin might be too; its whole userspace is free, unlike WSL which is proprietary except the kernel
[00:47:07] *** Quits: beaver (~beaver@user/pong) (Quit: leaving)
[00:47:21] <zleap> btdmaster, in which case can suggest cygwin
[00:47:31] <tejr> ggoes: I think the most important thing the FSF could do about the BIOS question at this point is to make a guide for applying it that's as high-quality as e.g. the email self-defense guide
[00:47:36] <mkulko> ggoes: well yeah thats the ideal outcome i think. although that doesnt solve the problem of power users who need doble nvidia cards or 64 cores to for example render complicated things in blender or something
[00:47:41] <juus> But cygwin is not "easy", especially for the casual user
[00:47:46] <ggoes> yeah, could be; whatever it is, we just need to be clear it's a convenient way to do some low-risk experimentation with gnu/linux utilities
[00:47:52] <tejr> LibreBoot is a marvel, but very hard to follow; almost everyone I know has found blog posts from someone else with their model of laptop
[00:47:56] <tejr> Instead
[00:48:08] <ggoes> mkulko: true but i think the intended audience is not that technical and wouldn't likely be someone who's doing complex 3D modeling. maybe, though
[00:48:28] <zleap> tejr, it may be worth collating those resources from people in to one place so they can be linked to
[00:48:30] <btdmaster> juus: is WSL inherently easier than cygwin?
[00:48:39] <ggoes> tejr: that's an interesting idea. do you mean one just explaining the problem, or one guiding you on how to flash the BIOS? the latter seems beyond the scope of a guide, as most of the time it's rather difficult and involves a breadboard
[00:48:43] <juus> sorry not familiar with WSL
[00:49:07] <btdmaster> hell, if friction is the biggest problem it might be worth sharing https://bellard.org/jslinux/
[00:49:16] <tejr> ggoes: If it were me, I'd issue a call-to-action in the guide for hardware hackers to make LibreBooting easier and less intimidating
[00:49:30] <ggoes> tejr: hmm, yeah
[00:49:43] <monkwitdafunk> Libreboot can brick your machine, cause of less ROI
[00:49:43] <ggoes> the problem is the ways of making it easier are very limited
[00:49:46] <tejr> I understand that actually demonstrating it in this campaign would be out of scope
[00:49:58] <zleap> i think if it involves a breadboard , then this is where face to face meetings come in to their own
[00:49:59] <ggoes> because of what it involves; as you'll always have to use a breadboard with some machines etc
[00:50:18] <ggoes> yes zleap we commonly have libreboot parties when we're doing in-person events, like there's usually one at LP
[00:50:24] <tejr> ggoes: Yes, but: help them identify their machine; help them identify a single FOSS-friendly breadboard (don't make them pick); etc
[00:50:26] <mkulko> ggoes: yeah, unlikely. or maybe start something like a fund where anyone can donate and then hire a programmer with that money that will port libreboot to the desired target?
[00:50:48] <tejr> Point them to a recipe, a list of products that the FSF endorses, says "you'll need all this stuff, it costs USD$X total"
[00:50:57] <zleap> Foss friendly breadboard these are just prototyping boards right
[00:51:03] <ggoes> yeah, perhaps
[00:51:32] <ggoes> my current machine is one that it's easy on (07 macbook) but i think it might be the only libreboot laptop that doesn't require total disassembly
[00:51:34] <tejr> But as others are saying: maybe don't make them think they have to do it right away either and that installing a free OS is a great step on this ladder
[00:51:45] <ggoes> right tejr that's important
[00:51:50] <monkwitdafunk> I only buy csa, ul, tuv, and ce listed
[00:52:07] <mkulko> ...although with modern ME'd and PSP'd machines it's impossible to not have demons
[00:52:15] <ggoes> we never want to give the impression that libreboot is necessary to use free software; as the point is that each incremenetal step is helpful. libreboot is like a "100%" goal that you don't have to immediately get to
[00:52:31] <ggoes> but which you should get to if you're able
[00:52:39] <tejr> ggoes: There will be some enthusiast subset of the readers who do eventually want to get there but yes best not to dwell on it
[00:53:02] <tejr> The reason this campaign has got me animated is I think it's RMS' essay about helping in small ways made more practical
[00:53:07] <ggoes> yeah
[00:53:11] <zleap> I think we need to step back and keep it simple
[00:53:25] <ggoes> haha yeah zleap
[00:53:35] <zleap> so decide where on the ladder hardware is,  probably higher up as it = expenditure

[00:56:36] <ggoes> good question. i don't think there's a similar one out there, so we might have to just say that if you're not using an fsdg-distro, you're using at least some free software

[00:58:14] <tejr> The particular problem I don't envy the FSF having here is that the whole campaign up to this point has been about tolerating small concessions in favour of big wins and a progressive approach, and I wonder if that would extend to mentioning or even linking to distributions of GNU/Linux that are not fully free, but which have a reputation for accessibility

[01:00:02] *** Joins: denza242 (~denza242@sapphire/support/denza242)
[01:00:14] <mkulko> ...although we did mention this in the previous step, i guess
[01:00:30] <zleap> tejr, that is better for me, i think 0.1 perent isn't too bad
[01:00:34] <zleap> percent
[01:00:41] <Noisytoot> You can get a WiFi dongle
[01:00:42] <ggoes> mkulko: yeah, we plan to mention projects like that. that aren't perfect (as no mobile phone is), but which people should know about / keep an eye on
[01:00:57] <drakonis> maybe drum up awareness regarding something like guix :V?
[01:00:57] <monkwitdafunk> mkulko: that is a good idea amd my doctor is an a hole
[01:01:01] <zleap> Noisytoot, then spend hours struggling to tell debian to use it
[01:01:03] <lxo> every step you take towards freedom helps :-)
[01:01:05] <ggoes> Noisytoot: yeah, we'll be sure to integrate RYF as much as possible, letting people know that while they might nto have that hardware already, finding places to buy it isn't that difficult
[01:01:13] <zleap> without face to face support I really struggle with somethings
[01:01:43] <tejr> It's sometimes infuriating how bad the WiFi situation is; it holds so much of this back
[01:01:44] <Noisytoot> zleap, It's very easy to tell Debian to use it. If you remove the nonfree firmware and install the free firmware, it will use the external one
[01:01:48] <Noisytoot> <monkwitdafunk> I think we need our own members email
[01:01:52] *** Quits: Guest5395 (~tfisgnag@181.199.144.33) (Quit: Client closed)
[01:01:53] <ggoes> zleap: from an ease of use perspective the debian installer's method of having you load nonfree firmware on a flash drive is like.. harder than the install itself. it's weird and confusing; has to be in a specific filesystem format, etc
[01:01:55] <btdmaster> i was wondering if maybe mentioning risc-v and looking at open source hardware might be a thing to get something from
[01:01:56] <Noisytoot> say that in the members' meeting at LibrePlanet
[01:02:00] <tejr> Even just a few widely-deployed totally-free WiFi chipsets would go an enormous way to stopping people getting discouraged
[01:02:07] *** Joins: tfisgnag (~tfisgnag@181.199.144.33)
[01:02:18] <mkulko> ggoes: if only GSM/EDGE/LTE and broadband chip oems were not that terrble, if only...
[01:02:22] <ggoes> right
[01:02:30] <zleap> ggoes, i agree, hence i use the non free installer
[01:02:32] <tejr> ggoes: Which is why I usually don't bother and just tell them to download the disk images with the non-free images instead, if they hit that problem
[01:02:34] <mkulko> ggoes: yup i agree about the debian installer
[01:02:52] <tejr> *with the non-free firmware
[01:02:59] <tejr> I don't like doing it, but I don't want to see them give up
[01:02:59] <tpefreedom> Noisytoot: is someone starting with ubuntu/lmm/fedora too much of a concession?
[01:03:04] <zleap> saying that, i remember windows installer asking for a cdrom to install the cdrom driver once
[01:03:09] <Noisytoot> tpefreedom, What's lmm?
[01:03:10] <ggoes> we probably won't get into the specifics of which installer to use, but stay more high level
[01:03:13] <denza242> linux mint?
[01:03:16] <denza242> linux mint mate?
[01:03:18] <denza242> just a guess
[01:03:23] <tpefreedom> Linux Mint
[01:03:42] <Noisytoot> mkulko, there aren't any 3G adapters that work without nonfree software
[01:04:08] <Noisytoot> tpefreedom, It's better than Windows, but they should switch to an entirely free distribution
[01:04:24] <zleap> Mint is about ease of use for absoluate beginners
[01:04:28] <tpefreedom> Noisytoot replicant uses 3g is is fsf./gnu endorsed
[01:04:38] <zleap> they do an excellent job in that respect,  
[01:04:39] <denza242> how much gap remains between Mint and Ubuntu these days
[01:04:49] <zleap> not sure
[01:04:56] <juus> It seems the real problem is lack of free hardware
[01:04:59] <monkwitdafunk> The crtc in canada would probably accomodate class action lawsuit agaisnt 5G maybe
[01:05:01] <btdmaster> how about the install process itself? it was definitely quite a leap for me to write an ISO, change the boot order etc.
[01:05:03] <mkulko> zleap: mint has blobs and *i think* it has proprietary stuff in the repos
[01:05:08] <ggoes> Noisytoot: switching to an entirely free distribution is always the goal, no matter what. what we want to guard against is people holding off their switch because they can't get it 100% perfect
[01:05:12] <zleap> mkulko, yes
[01:05:25] <ggoes> as we'd rather have them get 90% there, and do the rest when they can
[01:05:26] <tejr> juus: Chicken-and-egg; if too few people use GNU/Linux as their daily driver, there's not enough demand for hardware support
[01:05:32] <denza242> 80% free is better than 0% free
[01:05:37] <ggoes> correct
[01:05:45] <denza242> (20/80 thing there too)
[01:05:54] <zleap> but for getting someone a taste of what Linux can do, it is a good start,  once they realise that Linux is not all command line and complex,  then we can work on the philosophical side of things
[01:05:59] <tejr> >what we want to guard against is people holding off their switch because they can't get it 100% perfect  # I can't stress enough how important I feel this is
[01:06:02] <tejr> So many people just give up
[01:06:13] <monkwitdafunk> Yeah but hardcore is 100 fres
[01:06:29] <zleap> tejr, i think I would give up being told to go out and buy a wifi dongle and take out the built in one
[01:06:41] <tejr> zleap: I think lots of people would
[01:06:43] <Noisytoot> *GNU/Linux
[01:06:48] <lxo> one thing I learned from debates about whether to install non-free distros at free software install fests (FLISoL, specifically) was that a lot of people got involved matters in order to promote their favorite distro, rather than to promote freedom to users.  
[01:06:49] <zleap> no disrespect to Noisytoot on that idea, but a lot of people can't, and can't afford to pay someone to do it
[01:06:52] <denza242> when i first got into linux i remember needing to reinstall Ubuntu like, 20 times in a year. I was coming in with 0 knowledge. 
[01:06:56] <lxo> s/matters//
[01:06:59] <monkwitdafunk> I would never operate a lan with wifi
[01:07:06] <Noisytoot> zleap, Do you mean installing libreboot?
[01:07:17] <ggoes> lxo: yeah, there's a kind of tribalism / partisan thing that comes up there, with people trying to represent their particular distro more than freedom
[01:07:19] <denza242> Now, while I was invested in learning, many people just want to be able to jump into whatever
[01:07:30] <zleap> Noisytoot, most users won't know where to start taking their computer apart to remove a wifi adapter
[01:07:44] <tejr> denza242: To an extent, the people reading the guide are pre-qualified; they're *at least* curious about the principle of freedom
[01:08:00] <denza242> ggoes: while I'm pro distrochoice, that's one of the biggest problems i've seen, even with the easy distros the problem is the plural
[01:08:03] <denza242> 'distros'
[01:08:06] <tejr> Otherwise they'd've installed ZorinOS or Arch already because it looked cool on their friend's computer
[01:08:11] <Noisytoot> zleap, they can use a WiFi dongle
[01:08:25] <zleap> Noisytoot, you suggested earlier that I take the old one out
[01:08:32] <denza242> Someone asks 'hey, I'm interested in Linux, what should I do?' 10+ different distros suggested 
[01:08:33] <zleap> or the built in hardware
[01:08:34] <lxo> I expect this to be an issue in most open-community user-support fora
[01:08:38] <ggoes> yeah
[01:08:43] <tejr> denza242: And the never-ending and ceaseless distribution wars where it doesn't matter nearly as much as people wish it did
[01:08:46] <monkwitdafunk> No no no stability and bug free
[01:08:50] <ggoes> which speaks to the point of encouraging people to go to forums that put freedom first
[01:08:51] <Noisytoot> zleap, I said remove the firmware (with apt remove), not remove the wifi card
[01:09:00] <zleap> my HP mini probaby does not support libreboot
[01:09:01] <denza242> And nobody has the authority to say "such and such is _the_ beginner distro, nothing else can be recommended"
[01:09:07] <zleap> Noisytoot, ah ok
[01:09:08] <mkulko> tejr: yeah so first we need to market them the idea of freedom
[01:09:09] <denza242> even though that would help adoption
[01:09:16] <ggoes> yeah denza242 the "paralysis of choice" problem is a thing. after all, there are multiple fsdg distros, too
[01:09:29] <ggoes> i use guix but some people prefer trisquel etc etc
[01:09:31] <denza242> even within distros, you have different spins
[01:09:48] <zleap> and some work better than others on specific hardware
[01:09:55] <denza242> Ubuntu, Ubuntu MATE, Xubuntu, Kubuntu, Lubuntu, Ubuntu Studio, and that's not even getting into derivative distros
[01:09:56] <drakonis> what should i tell someone that walks in on the guix channels and ask about their hardware not working?
[01:09:59] <mkulko> ggoes: i think guix is what shoud have been called just 'GNU' lol
[01:10:08] <btdmaster> i guess get people to backup their dotfiles so they can change distro without uncapped losses?
[01:10:20] <ggoes> drakonis: i think that's out of the scope of this particular discussion as guix is very much geared toward power users
[01:10:24] <tejr> Funnily enough, sometimes the stick approach works here.  I keep seeing that RMS clip of him saying "all users of Windows are suckers" at some conference or other.  A lot of people (maybe angry young men in particular) hate to be thought of as foolish, and showing them how their freedom is being slyly taken from them can accomplish that
[01:10:25] <juus> For first step users? Easy install is paramount.
[01:10:28] <ggoes> the ladder's directed to people who aren't especially technical
[01:10:40] <denza242> gonna butcher up an analogy here
[01:10:40] <zleap> ggoes, +1
[01:11:01] <zleap> i think as technical users we forget what non technical is
[01:11:09] <tejr> ggoes: What I worry about is that the guide eagerly says "install Trisquel", the user does, the WiFi doesn't work, they give up
[01:11:22] <drakonis> i have been considering switching hardware because when i built a computer before i was even remotely away of how badly nvidia would be supported across the board
[01:11:26] <juus> right tejr
[01:11:38] <ggoes> tejr: well, i think we'll be directly telling them that their hardware might not work
[01:11:43] <tejr> Good starrt
[01:11:45] <ggoes> so they'll be prepared for that
[01:11:46] <denza242> FOSS is like a bar. If you have 30 different people hawking 40 different drinks outside of the bar, chances are, people are going to go to a different bar entirely. You need to get people in the bar itself.
[01:12:11] <ggoes> i think the trisquel installer might say that itself.. but in any case, they'll know
[01:12:15] <zleap> any distro will tell you in plain text what hardware you have, that info can be copied / pasted in to forums etc,   try that with windows
[01:12:20] <monkwitdafunk> Danza kaduro! 
[01:12:27] <ggoes> and in particular, they'll know *why* because too often it just looks like a technical failing of gnu/linux

[01:13:48] <zleap> adfeno, not sure, i don't know ehough about uefi, efi etc
[01:13:49] <adfeno> If that is about requiring not to be able to disable SecureBoot, then thy must provide ways for the end-user to add his own list of trusted certificates.
[01:14:15] <zleap> adfeno, that is enough to make most people run a mile
[01:14:25] <adfeno> But, if they are only requiring to not be able to disable UEFI/EFI, then I see no issue as long as the user can manage the keys/certs.

[01:16:08] <btdmaster> adfeno: windows 8 certification on ARM did require permanent UEFI Secure Boot, but other architectures required it to be opt-out: https://www.webcitation.org/69p0SYX8t?url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2011/09/22/protecting-the-pre-os-environment-with-uefi.aspx

[01:22:22] <ggoes> we're going to be putting an enormous amount of work into finding the right way to address the issue of incremental steps; i've talked with rms quite a bit about it, so it's not like we're going to be endorsing debian. the user will be aware of the trade-offs, and will know the freedom issues those distros have, but will use it as a stepping stone to full freedom

[01:22:29] <btdmaster> ggoes: i don't think dealing with the devil is a fair metaphor in that case. the user is already dealing with the devil with the fully non-free OS they're using - they're reducing their business with the devil, even if they weren't aware of the devil's presence before.

[01:22:57] <tejr> denza242: I'm not picky; Synaptic is just the one I know.  The point is to be able to see in a few clicks, "man, there's a LOT of stuff here for me to explore"
[01:22:58] <denza242> it's pretty similar to Synaptic 
[01:23:03] <Noisytoot> tpefreedom, but you'll probably need to buy new hardware, and I don't think there are very many amiga os users
[01:23:25] <monkwitdafunk> Amiga is so old
[01:23:27] <denza242> but, unless synaptic's behavior has changed, Muon does offer being run as a user over being run as root

[01:23:47] <mkulko> by the way, off topic question, but is the user nicknamed [R] and full-named RMS on IRC is actually rms?
[01:23:51] <ggoes> no
[01:23:56] <monkwitdafunk> You update the drivers to watch something and it breaks
[01:23:57] <denza242> As much as I like ReactOS, I would not recommend it to people looking for a daily driver
[01:24:06] <mkulko> oh okay thanks for clarifying
[01:24:38] <btdmaster> mkulko: apparently on some Acer laptops you need to set up a supervisor password first before disabling secure boot is available? not sure if this applies to yours though.
[01:25:09] <juus> mkulko, IRL my name also has the initials rms!!!
[01:25:14] *** Joins: wolftune (~aaron@75.164.131.0)
[01:25:15] <monkwitdafunk> I thought you pull out the storage and cmos battery
[01:25:28] <tpefreedom> So maybe focus more on DEs or wms that look/behave like someone's old os.
[01:25:31] <Noisytoot> mkulko, right click, drag your mouse to "Delete" in the menu and let go, right click on the window
[01:25:51] <Noisytoot> mkulko, I don't think RMS uses IRC
[01:25:51] <denza242> one thing that's important, is that we need angles
[01:26:00] *** Quits: otisolsen70 (~otisolsen@xd4ed80b5.cust.hiper.dk) (Quit: Leaving)
[01:26:00] <ggoes> one problem we'll need to put some time into thinking about is nonfree JS. we don't trisquel to become a vehicle for nonfree software, i.e. the user switches to an fsdg-distro only to run tons of nonfree software in their browser
[01:26:01] <drakonis> real talk though
[01:26:02] <ggoes> but that's tricky
[01:26:15] <zleap> tpefreedom, well a few have a button in the corner like the windows start button (or what ever they call it now)
[01:26:15] <tejr> ggoes: Something I idly wondered about is some sort of tier infographic to keep going with the freedom metaphor; pictures of happy people on all stages, level 1 is labelled "has replaced one free program", level 2 is labelled "has removed XYZ"...
[01:26:29] <ggoes> tejr: yeah, there are plans for an infogrpahic
[01:26:30] <tejr> ggoes: People being what they are, they'll proudly boast to others about which rank they're on right now, and compete
[01:26:35] <mkulko> btdmaster: yes, i searched it up and found that, however setting the supervisor password still doesnt unhide the secure boot settings.
[01:26:35] <ggoes> uh, infographic
[01:26:44] <drakonis> how to reasonably give people a bridge into free software that isnt pretty much "boo hoo, throw your hardware into the trash because its evil"?
[01:26:44] <ggoes> if not video
[01:26:57] <adfeno> zleap: vrms follows DFSG (starting D is for Debian), not the FSDG.
[01:27:13] <tejr> drakonis: I think that's unduly negative; more of my hardware works with free drivers than I can ever remember being the case
[01:27:15] <denza242> Free Software is important to us, because we understand what it means
[01:27:19] <ggoes> drakonis: the bridge is that we are never, ever saying they have to buy something to use free software; only that *when* they're in a position to buy something, and are looking for a new device, to prioritize those that respect their freedom
[01:27:19] <mkulko> ggoes: people who used to watch youtube or search up with google will need to change their habits then 
[01:27:23] <denza242> and we understand the impact
[01:27:23] <monkwitdafunk> It starts with corporate junk
[01:27:26] <zleap> the fsfe has a hacking for freedom sticker,  maybe we need one that says heading for freedom
[01:27:31] <drakonis> ggoes: fair enough
[01:27:43] <denza242> but, does the average person care? If we're trying to get people in the door, we need more angles
[01:27:44] <drakonis> i've had a build that requires nonfree drivers to work
[01:27:44] <[R]> mkulko: I am *a* RMS, but I am not stallman
[01:28:06] <Armand> Be grateful.
[01:28:09] <mkulko> ggoes: yeah
[01:28:10] <tpefreedom> Zleap, what about mac users? Budgie?
[01:28:12] <tejr> Ricardo Mateo Stallmana
[01:28:29] <zleap> I found being able to dual boot helpful, what was more helpful was the fact I could run open office on both windows and linux, so work flow wasn't affected
[01:28:32] <denza242> KDE is very customizable, for example. I know a decent amount of semi-power users on windows who lament how locked down Win10 is in terms of customization
[01:28:33] <ggoes> mkulko: yeah. nonfree JS to free JS is like a ladder in itself. but we'll be addressing it at least a bit i imagine
[01:28:35] <denza242> that's an angle
[01:28:39] <kline> tejr, hola
[01:28:51] <mkulko> [R]: thanks for clarifying!
[01:28:55] <tejr> kline: Hello
[01:29:14] <tejr> zleap: I don't like recommending dual boot to people because in my experience they just stay in Windows all the time
[01:29:27] <drakonis> i am planning to get better hardware on my next build that won't have those issues, however, until then, i'm still saddled with nvidia
[01:29:32] <kompowiec_> i think IRC for stallman would be a waste of time.
[01:29:33] <denza242> yeah dual boot usually translates into one or the other most of the time
[01:29:34] <zleap> tejr, but the fact the same software is available in both
[01:29:37] <tejr> I think you stand a better chance with the approach of running two computers in parallel---find an older but useable one and install $X GNU/Linux on that
[01:29:38] <btdmaster> ggoes: I think with JS exposing people to open platforms, like Mastodon, Matrix, XMPP, PeerTube etc. works best
[01:29:38] <kline> drakonis, oh dear
[01:29:48] <drakonis> yes dear
[01:29:55] <ggoes> yeah btdmaster
[01:30:12] <Noisytoot> drakonis, Does it work with nouveau?
[01:30:20] <zleap> yes we need to get people on these replacements more
[01:30:25] <ggoes> denza242: yeah, the early stages will get people using a good amount of cross-platform free software that they can continue using when they switch to gnu/linux
[01:30:30] <drakonis> barely
[01:30:36] <denza242> actually, KDE's customizability can be a double bonus
[01:30:37] <drakonis> extremely barely
[01:30:41] <ggoes> as it serves the dual purpose of getting them using more free software and easing their transition
[01:30:46] <zleap> ggoes, +1
[01:30:54] <tejr> Does the FSF still maintain that suggested-equivalents guide?
[01:30:56] <drakonis> i got a gpu from when nvidia started introducing signed firmware requirements to actually have reclocking
[01:31:01] <denza242> you can show people not only can you do more with your desktop than modern windows, but you don't have to touch a single line of 'code' or the 'terminal' to do so.
[01:31:03] <tejr> "If you need $X, consider using $Y, $Z..."
[01:31:05] <drakonis> so it has horrible performance everywhere
[01:31:21] <denza242> i think that in itself is very important
[01:31:26] <drakonis> its useful in the barest sense of the word
[01:31:31] <zleap> tejr, well they usewindows / dualbooted with Linux until windows decides to mess up, get a virus, or whatever and they switch to linux and carry on
[01:31:39] <denza242> the myth that you need to be a programmer and an expert with the CLI still persists to this day
[01:31:40] <drakonis> it just runs but i can't use it for any graphically intensive task
[01:31:50] <zleap> denza242, +1
[01:31:57] <tejr> denza242: I think it's two-pronged; make them realise the terminal is not as scary as hacker movies make it look, and also reassure them that it's not typical to need it all the time
[01:32:06] <denza242> Plasma 5 is a perfect showcase to the opposite. You can do a lot without touching code/CLI
[01:32:07] <kline> zleap, what actually happens is a windows update comes along and it tries to "fix" the mbr and breaks reaching grub and people go back to windows full time
[01:32:09] <ggoes> yeah denza242 there's something to that, i'm just not sure how to work it in. we definitely want to show them that free software enables them to think outside the box and use things in many more ways than they might be used to with a nonfree OS
[01:32:09] <mkulko> btdmaster: that works, hoewever for example with mastodon or matrix to communicate with their relatives people will also need to get them to start using matrix or mastodn (although this may be a plus depending on how you look at it)
[01:32:21] <tejr> kline: Yeah and that
[01:32:33] <zleap> kline, ah sorry, i dual booted back in the days of win3.1
[01:32:34] <denza242> ggoes: a demo of configuring KDE to have bells and whistles or be simple would be good
[01:32:40] <ggoes> kline: i think if at all possible we're going to avoid discussions of dual booting just because of that problem
[01:32:40] <drakonis> Noisytoot: nouveau is not an improvement when i can tap only 10% of my gpu perf and even then, with a lot of restrictions
[01:32:45] <tejr> You can start saying "boot off a different drive then" and you're already beginning the path to accepting that a separate computer is warranted
[01:32:54] <denza242> with an emphasis on how there's GUIs for everything
[01:32:58] <btdmaster> mkulko: i think it's much easier to convince someone to use $X rather than convince them to stop using $Y, hence the suggestion.

[01:33:02] <denza242> tejr: baby steps
[01:33:26] <denza242> not that i disagree
[01:33:28] <kline> is this some kind of meeting ive just arrived in
[01:33:35] <zleap> i tried to help someone on mastodon earlier, kde file previews (like vidoes) were not working so I suggested there used to be a setting for that,  found a screen in lxde to set the preview size and sent that
[01:33:36] <Noisytoot> kline, yes
[01:33:37] <kline> or we just inexplicably engaged today
[01:33:39] <btdmaster> it doesn't even have to anything in particular, lichess is a great example of this
[01:33:41] <ggoes> yep, but welcome
[01:33:41] <kline> oh ok

[01:34:22] <btdmaster> is anyone up for a match? half-joking, of course.
[01:34:40] <tejr> Time to get ready for work but thanks for this ggoes 
[01:34:45] <denza242> I think emphasizing choice is going to be a killer angle
[01:34:47] <ggoes> np tejr thanks for joining
[01:34:52] <zleap> tejr, what about devices like raspberry pi, sure there are firmware blobs but they may be a step to saying free software isn't scary
[01:35:15] <monkwitdafunk> Man! I got my info tech pictured in my head, but im not a cyber op.
[01:35:17] <Noisytoot> zleap, there are similar single board computers that work without firmware blobs
[01:35:33] <mkulko> zlesp: mostly ppl who use single boards like this are already familiar with tech i think
[01:35:34] <zleap> Noisytoot, which is what I tried to ask about earlier, can we have a list on the fsf site please or somewhere
[01:35:35] <denza242> raspi has brand recognition
[01:35:41] <denza242> man, branding is another issue
[01:35:46] <lxo> I wonder if gamification of the ladder would do good, as in serving as motivator.  end goal: bring down the amount of non-free software in your life to zero.  multiple dimensions in which progress can be made: apps, OS, firmware blobs, web blobs
[01:35:47] <drakonis> btw, will the fsdg undergo any changes?
[01:35:52] <zleap> mkulko, the raspberry pi is aimed at kids to get them in to computing
[01:35:55] <drakonis> or will it remain static forever?
[01:36:05] <lxo> it's not so much of a linear progression as a multi-dimensional ladder
[01:36:12] <btdmaster> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_open-source_computing_hardware
[01:36:39] <mkulko> zleap: well i never knew that, thanks 
[01:36:44] <drakonis> btdmaster: these are all expensive in a way or another
[01:36:49] <drakonis> so they're typically a nonstarter
[01:36:52] <zleap> btdmaster, that says open source,  which could confuse people looking for free software
[01:36:55] <zleap> but thanks
[01:36:56] <monkwitdafunk> lxo: that is the point but i submit to medical device manifacturers and doctors
[01:37:00] <ggoes> lxo: yeah, we're going to try to find some way to do that
[01:37:08] <ggoes> gamificiation / "achievement" etc, if it fits
[01:37:12] <monkwitdafunk> Therefore i limit my use

[01:39:25] <zleap> most people goto local store or online, if we want people to buy freedom respecting hardware we need to make it as easy as a few clicks
[01:39:26] <monkwitdafunk> And i wanted it to be ported to linux under an osi lisence
[01:39:51] <zleap> ggoes, how does the fsf feel about pinebooks, etc

[01:44:59] <denza242> huh
[01:45:23] <monkwitdafunk> 5 inch floppy and dial up machine?
[01:45:26] <zleap> maybe the ladder needs to be 2 parts, hardware (firmware mostly) and software,  you can't have a fully free software system without firmware / hardware that is also free
[01:46:00] <monkwitdafunk> Which OEMs do we like?

[01:48:13] <monkwitdafunk> Yeah. I know. Im waiting for xoffee
[01:48:24] <tpefreedom> Zune is used on AROS which is meant to be an free or open source replacement for amiga os. Unfortunately a lot of AROS stuff is under a license similar to the MPL 1.1.
[01:49:35] *** jess is now known as j
[01:49:49] <tpefreedom> The Amiga community is really dedicated which is one of the main reasons why I think a fully free Amiga OS/morph os/aros replacement could be worth it.
[01:52:26] <monkwitdafunk> I cany remember the machine where everybody would wonder if it could run graphics

[01:53:07] <ggoes> i think we might do another meeting in the near future just to keep irc momentum going
[01:53:08] <zleap> ok
[01:53:14] <ggoes> but it won't necessarily be about this directly, just other advocacy stuff
[01:53:16] <zleap> that would be good
[01:53:21] <ggoes> if people have ideas i'd love to hear them
[01:53:29] <Noisytoot> the Free Software Directory meeting is tomorrow
[01:53:32] <ggoes> correct
[01:53:56] <btdmaster> i guess there was this huge question about spreading the message of freedom on non-free platforms - how would that work?
[01:54:30] <zleap> btdmaster that could work
[01:54:31] <specing> you make a virus that installs linux
[01:54:43] <specing> call it the freedomlocker, haha
[01:54:47] <ggoes> haha
[01:54:57] <denza242> frankly speaking, concessions will need to be made to some degree. People on free platforms probably already care/are aware of FOSS. 
[01:55:01] <zleap> but how about we get a strong community on mastodon for example so that we CAN then suppoort peopple on alternatives
[01:55:01] <denza242> at least, for now
[01:55:38] <ggoes> for now i'm going to call this one; if you want to catch up on past meetings, please check the wiki (we'll finish posting the other minutes soon), and feel free to leave comments on the discussion page / mail campaigns@fsf.org with any thoughts https://libreplanet.org/wiki/Group:Freedom_Ladder

[23:25:43] <craigt> ii: It does. There is a little "add another" box at the bottom of the page.
[23:25:51] <ii> Okay i'll do that

[23:26:33] <craigt> panosalevro: I assume those are all the licenses for the code included in the project. It is a smart approach actually because it covers all the bases.
[23:27:19] <panosalevro> craigt: yes, but that only makes sense if i can find appropriate documentation as to what license applies to which part of okular

[23:28:30] <panosalevro> anyway, we're approaching the end of the meeting soon
[23:29:03] <ii> Welp I hope I did my submission right
[23:29:33] <ii> I'm not going to make any more until I see if this one gets approved
[23:30:31] <craigt> ii: Very well, thank you. I can take a look.
[23:30:48] <craigt> Thanks everybody for another great meeting. I'm going to hang around for some follow up tasks.

[23:37:13] <panosalevro> thanks all! see you next week
[23:37:34] <Mikaela> Hi, I was pointed here from #gnu. I was wondering if anyone knows about Nixtape, where the code is hosted and whether it's alive? I think it used to be a GNU project
[23:40:35] <zleap> I can't see anything in the fsf directory or as a result of a apt search
[23:42:21] <Noisytoot> Mikaela, libre.fm uses GNU FM: https://www.gnu.org/software/librefm/
[23:43:07] <Mikaela> Noisytoot, on the bottom of libre.fm it says to be Nixtape and points to https://nixtape.org/ which isn't very informative
[23:43:55] <Noisytoot> "You have noticed some things are broken around here. We're embarking on a rewrite of the project under a new name, Nixtape."
[23:44:01] <Mikaela> and from your link everything else than libre.fm itself is a 404 error
[23:44:33] <zleap> Mikaela, which is really not helpful to anyone
[23:44:41] <Noisytoot> join #libre.fm
[23:44:55] <Noisytoot> (there was meant to be a "/" before that)
[23:45:07] <Mikaela> the channel seems to exist, but isn't registered apparently
[23:45:12] <Mikaela> oh
[23:45:17] <lispmacs[work]> Mikaela: with some energetic startpage searching I found this:
[23:45:19] <lispmacs[work]> https://github.com/mattl/nixtape
[23:45:50] <Mikaela> thanks :) that seems to say that the project is not currently very alive
[23:46:03] <zleap> is there a way to report these 404 erros so they can at least point somewhere useful?
[23:47:02] <seabass> craigt: thank you for taking a look at Confy! If it helps, libhandy is in Debian Main and Parabola, as are Meson and Ninja :)

[23:50:00] <hoppity> Is the meeting going to happen on this channel?
[23:50:19] <craigt> seabass: You are welcome! Getting the dependencies in the FSD is a part of adding entries. It makes for more work, but it ultimately makes for more entries in the FSD.
[23:50:23] <zleap> ok e-mail sent to webmaster @ gnu.org

[23:52:37] <seabass> aw thanks!
[23:53:10] <craigt> hoppity asked a question?
