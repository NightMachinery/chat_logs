[00:00:12] <evilgohan2> The area has been under dispute for the better part of a decade right now after declaring its Independence from Ukraine in 2014 subsequent to the revolution then
[00:00:24] <evilgohan2> However, internationally, it is still recognized as part of Ukraine.

[00:00:50] <evilgohan2> Or, at least, that was the case until today when Russiarecognized it as independent.
[00:01:31] <evilgohan2> (noting that both have declared themselves as independent People's Republics)
[00:01:54] <evilgohan2> Now comes the conjecture part.
[00:02:20] <evilgohan2> Say other nations are stating that you (Russia) are going to invade another nation (Ukraine)
[00:02:35] <evilgohan2> other nations say that these two cities are part of Ukraine.
[00:02:41] <evilgohan2> These two cities say they're independent.
[00:02:49] <evilgohan2> Russia says they recognize the independence.
[00:03:06] <linearbit> Hi, I'm planning to get two HDDs for storing most of my data in my new build which I'll probably just run in RAID 1, which type of drive and capacity would you recommend?
[00:03:09] <evilgohan2> Russia moves in forces into those cities. Claims they're just offering military aid.
[00:03:15] <evilgohan2> That's a possibility anyway
[00:03:54] <linearbit> I was thinking about Seagate exos ~14-18 TB drives but I'm not sure what the sweet spot is for capacity or whether drives from another vendor would be better price/performance
[00:04:07] <evilgohan2> linearbit: That question is impossible to answer with the information provided. How much storage do you need? What's your budget? Where are you located (availability + cost)? How many drives are you thinking here?
[00:05:52] <linearbit> yeah I think my second message answered most of that - I'm located in Europe and my budget is probably somewhere around ~300-350€ max per drive
[00:05:57] <rawktucc> evilgohan2, so this is a bad thing?
[00:06:01] <rawktucc> oh
[00:06:11] <rawktucc> linearbit, get the biggest drive you can afford I say
[00:06:15] <rawktucc> and have backups
[00:06:17] <rawktucc> UNLIKE ME!

[00:09:23] <linearbit> Yeah I think I've lost quite a bit of data from one of my old external drives probably being dead - I do have offsite backups for my really important data though
[00:10:04] <linearbit> rawktucc, so there isn't really a downside to, let's say, getting 20TB drives other than maybe price/performance?

[00:11:57] <evilgohan2> linearbit: just keep in consideration that larger drives come with higher times to rebuild arrays
[00:12:13] <evilgohan2> and such rebuilds can be stressful on otherwise healthy drives
[00:12:55] <linearbit> hmm good point
[00:18:54] <linearbit> I guess that would be an issue if I e.g. decide to go for 18TB drives and one of them dies there's more of a risk of the other drive dying as well before the array is rebuilt
[00:19:47] <evilgohan2> Ever the risk with RAID
[00:22:43] <KevinCarbonara> I heard that Netflix and Hulu have ads now. Is that true?
[00:22:52] <unfinity> ・゜゜・。。・ ​ ゜゜\_O​< FL​AP FLAP!
[00:22:59] <linearbit> I guess that's why you still need external backups (alongside other reasons), but it still seems like a better solution to me than not mirroring

[00:29:46] <rawktucc> linearbit, the downside you would see getting 20TBs would be price. A lot of people like to look at $/GB values, but realistically go for the biggest I say
[00:30:03] <rawktucc> simply because unless you're outfitting a full sized server, there's no sense in getting smaller drives if you can afford bigger ones
[00:30:13] <rawktucc> and yes, bigger and longer rebuilds do stress drives... but you should have backups
[00:30:31] *** Quits: brw (~bas@haring.bas.sh) (Quit: The Lounge - https://thelounge.chat)
[00:30:37] <evilgohan2> KevinCarbonara: Hulu has had ads for as long as I've known. Netflix, I haven't seen any.
[00:30:46] <rawktucc> i'll be setting up a raidz3 with zfs soon, 160TB > 104TB usable I think
[00:31:01] <rawktucc> i basically realized last night I have no actual backups. so much time spent on this and it could disappear tomorrow
[00:31:08] <evilgohan2> linearbit: I personally would always lean towards mirrored drives (RAID1 / RAID1+0) or parity.
[00:31:17] <rawktucc> this incoming download drive failing is a blessing I would say. im forced to rebuild

[00:40:36] <evilgohan2> I've not heard any bad things about Exos and Iron Wolf
[00:40:40] <evilgohan2> The question for you will come down to cost.
[00:42:32] <linearbit> Yeah the Exos seem to be significantly cheaper here
[00:44:43] <evilgohan2> KevinCarbonara: Indeed. Paid Hulu still had ads last I used it
[00:44:54] <evilgohan2> granted, that was YEARS ago, but it's my understanding that it persists.
[00:44:54] <KevinCarbonara> how the fuck are they still in business
[00:45:35] <evilgohan2> They appear to even have a helper page for it: https://help.hulu.com/s/article/ads-no-commercials
[00:46:56] <evilgohan2> So, in looking, they have two tiers (I guess free Hulu is gone now)?
[00:47:21] <evilgohan2> Hulu for $6.99/mo, or Hulu for $12.99/mo that has no ads with exceptions. 
[00:47:24] <evilgohan2> Plus some other tiers.
[00:47:36] <evilgohan2> and I don't know. When I tried it and saw ads, I cancelled immediately.
[00:47:41] <evilgohan2> That was... 10 years ago?
[00:47:52] <evilgohan2> But that was also back when they had a free tier

[02:03:11] <joepie91> ThePendulum: see, your mistake is assuming that they intend to stop it
[02:05:13] <ThePendulum> joepie91: what do they get out of it? if they want to give the impression the video is more active than it is they could just make up the numbers
[02:05:40] <joepie91> ThePendulum: I suspect it's something similar to the various Facebook controversies around ad numbers
[02:05:46] <joepie91> plausibly deniable fake metrics
[02:06:13] <ThePendulum> we're investing thousands a year fighting spam because at the end of the day people getting scammed and having to read irrelevant messages hurts more than it is making our sity look positively busy
[02:06:36] <ThePendulum> I guess youtube is big enough that no one can leave
[02:06:51] <joepie91> basically that, yeah
[02:07:04] <ThePendulum> but then again if they're not leaving anyway, why need spam to keep them there
[02:07:23] <ThePendulum> alas
[02:07:39] <ThePendulum> can't creators configure their own spam filters as well
[02:11:26] <joepie91> the fake metrics are to extract money from advertisers :p
[02:11:31] <joepie91> not to keep creators there
[02:12:45] <ThePendulum> I thought they get paid per 1000 views and the comments mostly just help getting the videos up in the algorithm
[02:13:25] <ThePendulum> so then you basically get the videos that people might want to watch dilluted with videos they didn't really want to watch because they just happened to get bombed with spam
[02:14:34] <ThePendulum> it makes sense to promote controversial content like facebook is known to do because people will click that and get angry about it, which is just as good or even better than them getting happy about it
[02:15:07] <ThePendulum> but this doesn't really have much relation to how engaging the video is, unless they're selectively keeping or removing spam lol

[23:38:14] <xel> yea, i would lying if I said that proton is in a perfect state. its generally pretty good but not 100%
[23:38:30] <xel> i just have a small ssd with windows on it for games only
[23:39:56] <evilgohan2> xel: people have been making the same claim about "WINDOWS GONNA TRACK YOU AND REPORT FOR YOU CRACKS" since Vista.
[23:39:59] <evilgohan2> It ain't happened yet.

[23:40:08] <unfinity> evilgohan2 you befriended a duck in 2.040 seconds! You have made friends with 212 ducks in #datahoarder.
[23:40:28] <xel> well they certainely do track you
[23:40:45] <xel> but haven't seen many examples of actively reporting anybody

[23:43:20] <xel> Guess it depends on your definition of "reporting"
[23:43:40] <evilgohan2> It's like that old conspiracy theory of "your ISP is reporting you for using BitTorrent!"
[23:43:41] <evilgohan2> lol
[23:43:42] <evilgohan2> no.
[23:44:12] <xel> not to the police, but they certainely "report" for advertising
[23:44:25] <evilgohan2> No, they really don't.

[23:44:35] <evilgohan2> Well, actually, that's too broad of a statement on my end.
[23:44:37] <evilgohan2> Let me narrow that down
[23:45:03] <xel> pretty sure on modern windows without any tweaks will actively track your local search history and use it in your bwosers
[23:45:07] <evilgohan2> ISPs are _not_ tracking what you're seeding or leeching, documenting that, and then selling that data to advertisers.
[23:45:33] <xel> obviously not, im not really talking about ISPs though.
[23:45:59] <xel> pretty sure their are companies that track public trackers and report that information to the ISP's who will send the cease and desist to you
[23:46:28] <evilgohan2> That's *very* different, and not quite how it works.
