[01:05:36] <rak> Oh, that's exactly what I'm looking for, thanks!
[01:09:49] <z3c3g3> question when using an IMAP folder: it looks like neomutt is fetching the message multiple times in my setup, which is an issue when there's big attachments (I see Fetching message... goes from 0 to 100% five or six times before the message get displayed)
[01:10:11] <z3c3g3> is there any way to avoid that and/or to not pre-fetch all the attachments?

[18:04:33] <eblake> question on config: normally, I like viewing the Tags: header in my pager ('unignore Tags' in my config file),
[18:05:05] <eblake> but I noticed that when I <forward> a message, the copy of the email that gets inlined into my editor includes the same header lines as what my pager sees by default,
[18:05:19] <eblake> and I don't need recipients of forwarded messages to see what Tags: I use internally
[18:05:24] *** Joins: bsd4me (~bsduser@user/bsd4me)
[18:05:47] <flatcap> ooh, that's an interesting bug
[18:05:47] <eblake> what's the best way to filter out which tags are included into a forwarded message, making it a different set of headers than what I view by default in the pager?
[18:06:12] <eblake> I did not check if mutt has the same behavior
[18:06:53] <eblake> (in part because Tags: is in part assimilated from notmuch tags, and mutt lacks notmuch integration)
[18:07:15] <flatcap> I don't think mutt can "unignore" the tags.  I remember that being added to neomutt
[18:09:27] <flatcap> they don't exist as headers, so we add them to the pager text as we generate it
[18:10:03] <flatcap> hmm... I guess that when we forward we're just recycling that tmp file
[18:10:54] <flatcap> that would mean two choices: re-render the email without the tags; try to filter them out
[18:12:26] <eblake> when <reply>ing to a mail, repeating the Tags line has a purpose - it is a pseudoheader (like fcc:), and ensures that the outgoing message gets the same tags as what it is replying to, which is a nice feature
[18:12:48] <eblake> but the location of headers in <reply> (actual headers) vs. <forward> (body of the email) is quite different :)
[18:12:54] *** Joins: M4rty (~M4rtyflex@91-166-220-92.subs.proxad.net)
[18:13:21] <flatcap> yeah, tricky!

[19:08:32] <immae> Hello! I’m trying to setup Autocrypt (using https://neomutt.org/guide/autocryptdoc.html), and I have access to the menu and all, but it doesn’t seem able to add new entries when I receive an e-mail with an Autocrypt header (I tried both IMAP and local file), did I miss something in the setup?
[19:08:50] <immae> (I use latest neomutt 20211029)
[19:11:53] <flatcap> immae: dunno.  you may be the first person to use it :-)
[19:12:12] <immae> ha ha
[19:12:12] <flatcap> I tested the setup parts, fairly recently, but that's all
[19:13:29] <flatcap> does the sending part work?  do the headers get set and sent?
[19:13:39] <immae> The Autocrypt header gets sent
[19:14:06] <immae> But since I cannot add new buddies (ddn’t try manually with gpg) I can never encrypt an e-mail
[19:14:15] <flatcap> ok
[19:14:53] <immae> well I guess adding it manually with gpg is not sufficient since there seems to be an autocrypt.db with some "peer" table in it
[19:15:10] <flatcap> yes, it has its own key store
[19:16:18] <flatcap> you could probably do it manually with `gpg --homedir=XXX`, but that's not the point
[19:16:33] <flatcap> please can you raise an issue
[19:16:52] <immae> Sure
[19:17:07] <immae> (Yes I tested the gpg content first)
[19:17:21] <immae> Doing some tests with a friend first, to see how fare it’s missing features
[19:18:07] <flatcap> thanks
[19:18:33] <flatcap> looking at the code, I can see the call to process the ac header
[19:21:14] <immae> Does it call an external program?
[19:21:53] * flatcap looks ...
[19:22:31] <flatcap> it seems to use the gpgme and sqlite libraries

[19:32:18] <flatcap> if you reply to the new one, then I'll have your key to experiment with

[19:32:44] <immae> (Didn’t receive anything yet)
[19:36:24] <flatcap> sorry, I'm an idiot.  resent
[19:37:31] <flatcap> thanks, got them
[19:37:33] <immae> Answered :)
[19:38:59] <immae> From there, if you try to answer me you won’t be able to select that you want encryption (at least, I cannot), and it will complain that it doesn’t know how to encrypt for me
[19:39:26] <flatcap> yes, I see that
[19:40:20] <immae> (I tried disabling pgp signing/encrypt too, to see if it collided, in vain)
[19:40:34] <immae> Ok if you confirm I’ll write an issue later (I have to flee now :) )
[19:40:39] <immae> Thanks for investigating that with me!

[20:21:39] <z3c3g3> is there any (direct or indirect) support of the IMAP $Forwarded flag?
[20:21:56] <z3c3g3> someway to put a tag or a flag on a message when it gets forwarded?
[20:27:37] <flatcap> immae: fixed in 2840b1cc9.  thanks for your help
[20:28:00] <gahr> z3c3g3: we don't currently handle those flags, but it might be interesting to support them
[20:28:33] <gahr> good weekend everyone
[20:28:44] <flatcap> bye gahr, you too
[20:40:00] <z3c3g3> thanks, have a wonderful week-end gahr
[20:44:50] <z3c3g3> and btw thanks flatcap, the find-mtime-based cleanup works perfectly to cleanup my message cache directory
[20:45:47] <z3c3g3> I was concerned it would download the entire folder, but just load messages when needed, so my understanding is as long as the index-format doesn't include anything that would force it to load the entire message, it won't until you open it, right?

[21:48:55] <amanda_> Hi! I'm a longtime neomutt user and some time not very recently I found that if I try to move between views, or even to search within my inbox while offlineimap is running I get "Unable to write /path/to/INBOX"
[21:49:17] <amanda_> I havn't tried very hard to resolve the issue but I would kind of love to.
