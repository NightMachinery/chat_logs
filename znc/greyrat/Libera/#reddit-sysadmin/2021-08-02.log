[02:51:40] <sd> 13<D​azMan> Our infrastructure in our office is the most basic you can get. An internet connection to firewall to switch to patch panel to the desk. That's it. No servers, no desktops, no SAN or NAS, nothing. Every desk is just a dock you plug a laptop into, connected to screens.

[02:55:59] <sd> 06<d​onron> Probably wont happen but anyways, I would look into explaining the DR methods you are already using in the cloud (e.g. availability zones and sets, geordedundancy, live replication) / backup and if you needed, you could setup cloud DR by e.g. backing up M365 (ExOn, SP, OneDrive) to a NAS or another cloud, same with your ressources
[02:56:09] <sd> 06<d​onron> Sorry for the M365 / AZ bias
[02:58:30] <sd> 13<D​azMan> Thanks for the responses. It's hard because when your multi billion dollar company that you're getting a service from goes down worldwide, there is nothing you can do. There's nothing to recover, as it's on the cloud. Unless there are some tools out there I don't know about.

[03:04:01] <sd> 06<d​onron> DazMan: It depends, you got to differenciate "glogal outage" and "local outage". What if a rack catches fire where your stuff is but others are safe? what if a DC catches fire but others not ?

[04:24:03] <Windows11> I don't like liars.  Especially liars worth a trillion bucks.  I'm currently running Windows 11 beta on an i5-650.  I did NOT forget a zero there.  1st gen Core i5.  The "requirements" are purely artificial (to sell new systems at environmental cost) and the checks are in the installer.

[04:28:32] <Windows11> JollyRgrs, I have read their junk.  Yet the system runs fine if you bypass their installer.  Yes, it would be "safer" on brand new hardware.  The millions of largely black people below the poverty line who will keep the old computers because it's all they can, will be LESS safe ending security updates for their device.

[04:29:40] <JollyRgrs> Windows11: lol "runs fine"... then later everyone will complain b/c of zero days due to having to make concessions for lower security devices
[04:29:59] <Windows11> Saying "because you are vulnerable to very hard to exploit bugs that require them to already be running code on your PC, we're also going to end patches for future remotely-exploitable software bugs on your device" isn't helping ANYONE be more secure.  Windows 11 could make use of TPM 2.0 and a lot of other things when available, but still install on older PCs and at least be fully patched software
[04:30:16] <gibby> cool
[04:30:19] <gibby> so anyway
[04:30:59] <JollyRgrs> just to remind everyone, this is not a gov't run chat, it is private-owned, so we are allowed to squash fake news once we are done playing with our dinner
[04:32:43] <Windows11> JollyRgrs, my main computer will be above the requirements well before 2025, and my employer (far from the worst impacted by government lockdowns) expects to have the budget to get all Windows 11-ready computers by Win10 EoL as well.  I am far from the poorest user, however, and my employer far from the most-struggling small business.  Worsening the digital divide is a problem, and one company having the market power to dictate that millions of 
[04:32:43] <Windows11> working PCs are now e-waste is also a problem.

[05:36:18] <Jay-Ros> quick googs tells me epoxy might even be better
[05:36:39] <Jay-Ros> wasn't sure if the resin would stay and the hardener would leak into the wood leaving the resin in a brittle state

[05:37:03] <Jay-Ros> ...wood
[05:37:26] <Jay-Ros> I've got some pieces of wood, and I've got a shitty PC I need to put in a case which isn't worth spending money on a case

[05:45:26] <Jay-Ros> because you're weird and have some agenda
[05:45:30] <JollyRgrs> ^^
[05:46:14] <Jay-Ros> there's not a single person here who's taken your side so far, and everyone's asked you to stop, and you continue to try to rub against the grain
[05:46:16] <JollyRgrs> Windows11: right now, to me, you are just one of those trolls that are so bad at trolling, I don't think you are meaning to troll... you are just bad
[05:46:26] <Windows11> I am weird because I am weird.  Plain and simple.  The experts cannot agree on why.
[05:46:26] <JollyRgrs> i love a good troll
[05:46:33] <JollyRgrs> but you gotta bring some pizazz to it
[05:46:43] <xe0n> or pizzzas

[05:46:59] <JollyRgrs> we got all kinds of weird in here... we can do weird. you're just doing "dumb and uneducated"
[05:47:11] <Jay-Ros> look at JollyRgrs, he has an opinion, but also incredibly likeable and dresses well

[05:47:59] <Windows11> I used to be a good troll, back when I used to actually troll. But I am currently not trolling
[05:48:18] <Jay-Ros> no you're just being a negative influence on an otherwise positive demographic
[05:48:33] <JollyRgrs> the only reason why you aren't currently trolling is b/c you aren't actively trying to... but other than that, you are trolling in every sense of the word
[05:48:36] <Jay-Ros> if someone said "oh please, tell me more" then you'd have the social cue to continue
[05:48:45] <Jay-Ros> but you've been continuously been asked to stop
[05:48:53] <Jay-Ros> i.e. adolescent behaviour
[05:49:01] <JollyRgrs> I've always told me nephew (who drones on about topics no one else cares about) to "know your audience"

[05:49:36] <Windows11> JollyRgrs, maybe your nephew has Ass-Burgers.  You should tell him to chew them so they stop coming out his ass whole and still in the bun.

[06:48:41] <jay-ros> no marks on the arms from hitting the desk, fabric's still good
[06:49:04] <JollyRoger> There was actually something I wanted to ask on this front...
[06:49:11] <jay-ros> the armrest has a little wiggle to it I could prob jury rig

[06:51:08] <JollyRoger> ryalln - yeah! Something like that.
[06:51:55] <JollyRoger> I'm thinking of building mine out of some steel pipe and kee-klamps. I have an old recliner sofa that I was thinking I could saw in half. 
[06:52:10] <JollyRoger> Or remove the upholstery from the other side of the frame and brace it on that.
[06:53:57] <jay-ros> JollyRoger, if you got the same size pipe...
[06:54:03] <JollyRoger> Yeah?
[06:54:10] <jay-ros> https://www.selby.com.au/single-lcd-mount-13-27-inch-sat07c011.html
[06:54:32] <jay-ros> I got these monitor arms, that'd just roll over the top and clamp onto the poipe
[06:54:59] <JollyRoger> That'd be perfect, actually!
[06:54:59] <jay-ros> worst case scenario you're a tiny bit off and you use a beer can as a shim
[06:55:20] <jay-ros> (soft aluminium is a good shim material)
[06:55:32] <JollyRoger> Oh yeah that's a great idea!
[06:56:10] <jay-ros> best thing is, if you're using steel pipe, it's got the strength for some holes and rubber grommets...
[06:56:22] <jay-ros> you could use the interior for cable management
[06:56:25] <JollyRoger> Currently I've got access to a large amount of schedule 40 galvanized steel pipe, which I can simply cut with a pipe cutter and a strapwrench. It gives off that "zinc" smell, but it won't rust and I can just paint it with some spray-on engine paint and let it dry.
[06:57:10] <jay-ros> grab the cheapest sealing paint you can find, tape the outside so it's not coated, and roll it in a long-ass container to seal the inside
[06:57:19] <jay-ros> that'll fix the inside smell
[06:57:25] <JollyRoger> Oh damn that's perfect.
[06:57:44] <jay-ros> like, semi-submerged and roll it around, then hang it up
[06:57:53] <JollyRoger> That's a great idea!
[06:58:28] <JollyRoger> With the key clamps as well, I can always adjust the height by simply loosening one grub screw with an allen key, sliding it to the right position, then tightening it back down.
[06:58:57] <JollyRoger> I might drill some divots in the side of the pipe at 1" intervals, so that way the grub screw can "lock" into the hole, and it won't be dependent on friction to hold the monitors up.
[07:00:03] <jay-ros> only thing you've gotta consider then is floor mounting?
[07:00:41] <JollyRoger> Yeah. The good news is, I've got some steel plates and a large rubber mat, so what I'm going to do is likely weld one of the key clamps to the steel plate, then put some contact cement on the rubber mat and stick it to the bottom of the steel plate.
[07:01:26] <JollyRoger> So it won't scratch my floor. 
[07:01:33] <jay-ros> https://www.ebay.com/itm/362591695298
[07:01:41] <sd> 07<x​oxo> I'll clamp you
[07:02:06] <JollyRoger> Oh hot damn that's even better. No welding required, there!
[07:02:24] <JollyRoger> That's a great idea, I can just buy a pipe flange and attach it with some screws.
[07:02:46] <JollyRoger> *with some bolts.
[07:03:34] <jay-ros> other things that might be handy...

[10:24:49] <xe0n> lol
[10:25:02] <jay-ros> yeah risk and recovery are paramount
[10:25:08] <csws> ravioli: Charlie
[10:25:12] <xe0n> why are you trying to improve, you've only just been handed the thing
[10:25:15] <Mark_Pinecone> Its managed by or SP and as i said their backup policy is unknown
[10:25:16] <xe0n> how about just learning how its setup first
[10:25:16] <xe0n> lol
[10:25:23] <DrZak> why are you trying
[10:25:31] <xe0n> he's trying ALL things
[10:25:32] <xe0n> lol
[10:26:23] <ravioli> oh, be easy on him
[10:26:46] <Mark_Pinecone> TBH I'm aiming at DevOps in future that's why i took this responsobility
[10:26:49] <ravioli> csws: omg give charlie some pats for me please
[10:27:28] <csws> i'm at work :(
[10:27:35] <xe0n> suck shittttttttttttttttttt
[10:27:54] <csws> Mark_Pinecone: where's this shit running
[10:28:04] <csws> "from cloud"? is the infra already in the cloud?
[10:28:19] <csws> veeam has a cut down web UI cloud backup thingy that works alright
[10:28:30] <csws> works better than using agents in the cloud imo (tho you don't get appaware features at the moment)
[10:28:39] <Mark_Pinecone> Linux infra is runing in the cloud managed by vCloud director
[10:28:51] <jay-ros> yeah he's not mentioned budget, just implementation
[10:29:10] <xe0n> you should probably discuss with whoever is managing the existing backups...
[10:30:19] <csws> nah mark just yolo it
[10:30:22] <csws> fuck it right
[10:30:22] <csws> lol
[10:30:49] <Mark_Pinecone> :D
[10:31:01] <sd> 06<A​da> why do windows want me to use teams so badly
[10:31:12] <ravioli> $$$
[10:31:20] <Mark_Pinecone> I think it's BS that SP doenst give access to backups
[10:31:49] <Mark_Pinecone> vCloud director tenant has very limited access to hypervisor
[10:33:01] <Mark_Pinecone> But we are tied to it as we cant use public cloud like azure or aws
[10:33:42] <JollyRgrs> csws: huh, re:madison that's interesting
[10:33:44] <JollyRgrs> "apt-cache madison is not emphasized because most of what it displays is also available through apt-cache showpkg and apt-cache policy."
[10:33:47] <JollyRgrs> https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/276037/why-apt-madison
[10:34:21] <JollyRgrs> guess there used to be a tool that did this, and the madison command (named after the tool) displays the output in a similar fashion, which I guess old admins might be acustomed to
[10:34:27] <xe0n> expert sex change
[10:34:50] <Mark_Pinecone> Anyway at least now I have few ideas to work with. 
[10:35:22] <xe0n> well probably start off with what you've been asked to do with the environment
[10:35:25] <xe0n> you've been handed it, okay....
[10:35:25] <Mark_Pinecone> I have only one last question how do U backup running mysql/Percona DB's 
[10:35:26] <xe0n> whats next
[10:35:32] <JollyRgrs>  @Ada well, basically everything in o365 runs off of SP... SP is just the "data store" for all you do
[10:36:08] <JollyRgrs> if everything is in SP, it is soooooooouper easy to do those things like "a snippet of the spreadsheet from that email will be the only thing you see in your teams message b/c you were @'ed  at that part"
[10:36:26] <xe0n> ++
[10:36:27] <JollyRgrs> really cool features can come from centralizing your storage in the cloud... in MSFT's cloud specifically
[10:36:45] <ravioli> mmmm dat walled garden
[10:36:48] <JollyRgrs> onedrive? SP. SP? SP. Teams? SP.
[10:37:07] <JollyRgrs> well, i mean, teams itself isn't SP, but everything connecting to it is
[10:37:09] <JollyRgrs> so might as well be
[10:37:29] <xe0n> my favourite type of pasta is ravioli
[10:37:35] <xe0n> dat beef ravvv
[10:37:47] <JollyRgrs> esp from chef boyardee
[10:37:50] <ravioli> ugh
[10:38:01] <ravioli> the only good ravioli is cheese ravioli
[10:38:01] <JollyRgrs> oh sorry, i didn't put a trigger warning :P
[10:38:02] <xe0n> boyarrdeeeeee canned ravvvv isnt it
[10:38:07] <ravioli> reeeeeeee

[10:38:55] <JollyRgrs> i'm not really big on rav. i LOVE fettucini and small/med sized shells, elbows, sometimes riggatoni
[10:39:05] <xe0n> nice
[10:39:06] <JollyRgrs> but really... i'm just a white sauce guy
[10:39:18] <JollyRgrs> red sauce is fine for pizza or meatball subs, don't get me wrong
[10:39:22] <JollyRgrs> but not with pasta
[10:39:23] <xe0n> meatball sub!!
[10:39:25] <ravioli> REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
[10:39:42] <jay-ros> Mark_Pinecone, most likely staged data dumps
[10:39:57] <JollyRgrs> my wife makes a great spaghet and I can even make it good, too... I never WANT it. once it is cooked and in front of me, i'll devour it... but i'd still always prefer a white sauce instead
[10:40:00] <xe0n> take a staged dump on ya white sauce
[10:40:18] <JollyRgrs> what if someone went for a stage dive and took a stage dump as he was being caught?
[10:40:31] <ravioli> better than pasta w/ white sauce
[10:40:39] <JollyRgrs> gtfo rav
[10:40:49] <xe0n> rekt
[10:40:52] <ravioli> :o
[10:40:58] <jay-ros> a good red sauce will outdo a white sauce any day of the week
[10:41:11] <ravioli> all these ppl i gave +v to

[10:41:14] <xe0n> too much carbonara will fuck me up

[10:46:43] <JollyRgrs> And that brings us to our next point: Don’t use a spoon to twirl your spaghetti onto your fork. It’s customary to set the table with a fork, knife, and spoon, and you can use your spoon to add sauce and cheese, and then to mix the pasta. However, pasta is meant to be eaten with your fork alone – no spoons to assist.

[13:26:23] <riff-IRC> (lost a coworker in 1988 that way. power failed at 3am, generator came online at 3600RPM.)
[13:26:54] <riff-IRC> it tripped offline 3 hours later for "sustained moderate imbalance" and shut down.
[13:28:06] <DrZak> i hope he didnt manage to procreate before that incident
[13:28:41] <riff-IRC> I got the automated "double power failure" call at 630am that morning, indicating that utility power had failed and the generator had locked itself out.
[13:30:11] <crustacean>  That sounds painful
[13:30:41] <riff-IRC> Came up there, checked the controller logs, nothing out of the ordinary. Restarted the generator and brought it back online. As soon as the lights came on, I saw the spray all over the walls and threw the generator EPO shutdown switch.
[13:30:52] <Daryl> I'm sorry you had to deal with that. That must have been quite traumatic.
[13:32:06] <DrZak> the boss must've been rather confused at the call
[13:32:10] <DrZak> he did what??
[13:32:12] <DrZak> :)
[13:32:29] <riff-IRC> Not fun for sure. Ended up sending everyone home (myself included) for 6 months. On my way out the door, I threw the battery interrupter switch on the generator and switched off the UPS powering the control system so it couldn't possibly restart.
[13:32:56] <DrZak> 6 months?
[13:35:00] <DrZak> worst thing i ever saw was a schoolmate getting fatigued after night of drinking while holding a cover of a large transformer, his arms started wobbling and he had a weird face
[13:35:15] <riff-IRC> Yep. Didn't even get near the building for 4 months. May 1988 is when I decided to head back in and re-inspect the place. I also called out a cleaning company to deep-clean the entire generator room before we regrouped in June 1988.
[13:35:30] <DrZak> when the crew boss saw it, he thought he was getting fried, so he took the big 'testing stick' and smashed his arms
[13:35:36] <DrZak> broken in 13 places
[13:35:46] <riff-IRC> yikes
[13:36:23] <DrZak> and i hit my cocxycs from falling on my ass laughing so hard, another guy had a gashe on his forehead , since he was laughing too hard turned left right into a ledge
[13:36:44] <riff-IRC> Fired a few people for doing stupid stuff on the job, too.
[13:36:48] <Daryl> So your company was able to pause everything for 6 months and were ok with that? Most companies now would just do an overnight clean and be open again the next day!
[13:37:02] <DrZak> he wasnt the same after returning from a month of 'mommy can you wipe my ass' at 15

[17:02:21] <Jaelae> im gonna guess most people aren't going to show up
[17:02:35] <sd> 09<C​ukrus> so if dwpd metric is not relevant to my use case, would it be worth going non-dell ?
[17:02:57] <nobyk> Eventhough wearing a mask is not that hard
[17:02:58] <sd> 07<x​oxo> whatever floats your boat, use a tape drive if you want
[17:02:59] <nobyk> but I get it
[17:03:42] <Jaelae> well currently we come into the office, jump on calls and talk on a call the entire time - with people that are remote
[17:03:45] <Jaelae> so why not just stay home
[17:03:57] <sd> 07<x​oxo> my manager wants people to come in for the weekly standups but not everyone does
[17:06:46] <Jaelae> yea we discussed coming in for certain standups as a team so thats the reason we started going back to the office
[17:06:51] <Jaelae> problem is theres not enough seating for everyone
[17:07:00] <Jaelae> so they said half the team comes in two days and the other half the other two days
[17:07:08] <Jaelae> so that defeats the purpose of coming in to work with your team for meetings ;)
[17:07:18] <Daryl> I personally wouldn't feel incentivised to commute back to my office if I had to agree to wear my mask all day. Especially when I can do 99% of my stuff from home. Our company are saying we'll need to wear masks when we're walking around but when we're at our desk we can take them off.
[17:08:27] <Jaelae> yea thats fine i think. but during the pandemic i was coming in with nobody in the offiec but you had to wear a mask at your desk even if nobody is around
[17:09:12] <bagpuss_thecat> what's the general consensus on vxrail? It's upgrade time... currently a Vsphere 5.5 place with a few nodes and an out of date VNXe3200 SAN. I'm leaning towards a Nimble AF40 and a couple of DL360s, rather than the other quote which is 4 P570F all-flash VXRail nodes. We have zero vxrail experience, but the salesweasels are promsing that it's all super-easy pointy clicky fun...
[17:09:31] <Jaelae> ahh vxrail
[17:09:32] <Daryl> Yeah, that does seems a bit extreme!
[17:09:54] <Jaelae> so i have a lot of thoughts on vxrail. i like the concept but it doesn't really work as they may claim. 
[17:10:09] <bagpuss_thecat> I just have experience with traditional SANs and ISCSI, so I feel as if I may potentially be unjustly discounting the vxrail gear
[17:10:14] <sd> 13<C​olour> Why come into the office at allll
[17:10:19] <Jaelae> vxrail locks you into vxrail with their storage as well so any infrastructure you deploy with vxrail will require ALL nodes to be vxrail
[17:10:24] <Jaelae> if you want to deploy a new cluster it must be vxrail
[17:10:49] <Jaelae> the upgrade is also staged so you have to click - upgrade firmware ... wait for it to complete - then click upgrade esxi for patch .. wait for it to complete. repeat for each vsphere product
[17:11:24] <Jaelae> Colour - because the company said we have to . im gonna try to hold off until September now with the mask mandate
[17:11:28] <sd> 07<x​oxo> dell can suck it
[17:11:44] <fritzwastaken> FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK
[17:11:45] <sd> 07<x​oxo> simplivity has it's issues too
[17:11:47] <Jaelae> bagpuss_thecat:  also - if you get vSphere 7.0 they have lifecycle manager which has upgrades for your Dell/HPE or whatever hardware you can integrate into it
[17:11:48] <fritzwastaken> why am I in the office on a Monday
[17:12:02] <fritzwastaken> I dont want to spend 5 days a week in here with my boss
[17:12:06] <sintax> fritzwastaken: because the rest of us are.

[17:12:23] <Activ8> why am I at my desk not in an office on a monday
[17:12:28] <sd> 07<x​oxo> we can't upgrade past vcenter 6 because hp dropped support for cisco servers
[17:12:29] *** Joins: vinrock (~vinrock@user/vinrock)
[17:12:33] <sintax> I should be on my couch, no pants, watching the training
[17:12:42] <bagpuss_thecat> they were always a bit cagey when I said I'd like to, y'know, hang the old SAN off the back for laughs and testing
[17:13:12] <Jaelae> bagpuss_thecat:  here's our issue with that. Our VMware design is : Management Cluster - NSX Edge Cluster -> Compute Cluster 01, Computer Cluster 02..  With VXRAIL all of that has to be vxrail. But if we want Cluster 02 to be using a specific FC or iSCSI storage for whatever reason - we need vxrail with VSAN (paying a license) then we can add that storage on top of it.
[17:13:23] <bagpuss_thecat> I have no doubt the entry price is also 'attractive', but expansions options will take me to the cleaners
[17:13:38] <Jaelae> bagpuss_thecat:  i ended up simply buying VMware Cloud Foundation instead which is the same thing as vxrail without the dell hardware lockin. so i can deploy HPE or Dell or whatever
[17:13:54] <Jaelae> but it automates the bringup of your clusters. vcenter/nsx/vsan get auto deployed when you use it
[17:14:09] <bagpuss_thecat> very nice, yeah
[17:14:46] <Jaelae> for upgrades it is similar where you click upgrade to upgrade VCF to a new version, then upgrade to upgrade your vcenter and esxi hosts. its all automated sort of kind of. Lots of handholding so your environment is configured following best practices. 
[17:14:49] <bagpuss_thecat> I just have a small place with no massive growth, so it's one of those systems that will get bought in, I'll set it up, and then it'll sit and all being well 'just work(tm)' for the next 5 years
[17:15:05] <bagpuss_thecat> with upgrades, of course :-)
[17:15:13] <Jaelae> yup we are deploying VCF for our remote sites so its 4 node cluster to start then we can just add a node if needed. easy upgrade - easy to maintain.
[17:15:25] <bagpuss_thecat> sweet
[17:15:57] <bagpuss_thecat> pretty much made the decision for me. The lock in to VXRail can gtf
[17:16:11] <Jaelae> yea i like they idea of it and ive told them why make me have to buy vxrail for ALL clusters?
[17:16:22] <Jaelae> i understand for the primary cluster i buy it for ok. but you are 100% locked down and that really bugs me.
[17:16:25] <Jaelae> sales won't talk about it
[17:16:37] <bagpuss_thecat> my inner open source Linux nerd demands openness
[17:16:51] <Jaelae> rackspace likes it and deploys it for customers because its a pretty smart deployment to offer people going to use them for a colo
[17:17:21] <bagpuss_thecat> yah
[17:17:48] <Activ8> we moving from inhouse to colo soon, 150 customers to be migrated
[17:18:45] <Jaelae> my last job we were an app company that decided lets start with a colo. so our HQ had all web apps. office365 and all that. then we used a colo for our customer data on a separate domain. that way we could completely separate everything
[17:18:48] <Jaelae> was pretty nice actually 
[17:18:57] <bagpuss_thecat> we're a high value low volume manufacturing company with a larger than average R&D and technical side. We always lean towards the more self managed solution, even if it means requiring more technical knowhow or time

[19:57:25] <catbeard> <3
[19:57:59] <JollyRgrs> so MikeSpears you can get 1g up/down to your "home lab" from your house?
[19:58:10] <MikeSpears> yes
[19:58:16] <JollyRgrs> even when internet is out?
[19:58:27] <MikeSpears> I have redundant internet connections..
[19:58:34] <JollyRgrs> even when internets are out?
[19:58:54] <MikeSpears> I doubt ATT Fiber, Spectrum, and my cell service are ALL going to be out at the same time
[19:58:55] <zetorian> even when everything goes to shit and only JollyRgrs house still exists with power?
[19:59:02] <JollyRgrs> i am not going to pay comcast AND ATT for gigabit
[19:59:05] <MikeSpears> if they ALL are, I likely have bigger concerns
[19:59:08] <sd> 08<c​ritamine> Why am I interpreting this as a challenge
[19:59:10] <JollyRgrs> zetorian: EXACTLY!
[19:59:23] <sd> 08<c​ritamine> Time for some pilot lessons
[19:59:27] <JollyRgrs> MikeSpears: you don't get gigabit from your cell service
[19:59:35] <MikeSpears> I don't need gig
[19:59:44] <MikeSpears> ATT fiber is the only gig connection
[20:00:05] <JollyRgrs> yeah, and ATT is poop (I know this b/c I have this)
[20:00:09] <MikeSpears> nah
[20:00:16] <MikeSpears> my att service hasn't gone down ONCE
[20:00:21] <MikeSpears> it's been rock fucking solid
[20:00:32] <JollyRgrs> I get 1g/1g from modem to their internal tests... but most everything else has dropped substantially for any one connection
[20:00:41] <MikeSpears> weird
[20:00:48] <MikeSpears> I consistently get what I pay for
[20:00:50] <JollyRgrs> I can get 1g if I use enough other connections
[20:00:52] <JollyRgrs> I used to
[20:01:20] <JollyRgrs> haven't had enough time to REALLY troubleshoot it, so I just deal
[20:01:28] <JollyRgrs> price for what I get is still better than comcast at the moment
[20:01:29] <zetorian> I could never get the full 1G from att until I direct connected to the ONT and put their router internal
[20:01:40] <MikeSpears> I'm thinking about downgrading my service tho
[20:01:51] <MikeSpears> don't really need 1G
[20:01:55] <JollyRgrs> zetorian: what do you mean putting their router "internal"?
[20:02:35] <JollyRgrs> only things i've seen are the hacky vlan solution to put their modem outside of RFC spec to still auth with the certificate, but otherwise, it sits outside of all the networks
[20:02:38] <zetorian> You need their router to finish auth with it's certificate. But it doesn't need to be the main gateway.
[20:02:42] <JollyRgrs> which... I keep meaning to do
[20:02:58] <zetorian> That's exactly what I did. It's on it's own internal VLAN. Works great
[20:03:03] <JollyRgrs> yeah... I just gotta find time to mess with that... but my wife/kids don't really give me any change windows to do that with
[20:03:16] <zetorian> Hah, yea that can be a pain.
[20:03:20] <JollyRgrs> zetorian: do you have a link to the tutorial you followed?
[20:03:33] <zetorian> Lemme look, it was a while ago
[20:04:02] <JollyRgrs> and have you had to call up ATT for support since doing that? did they notice anything when they try to ping the modem or check it for issues, etc?
[20:04:18] <catbeard> quadruple nat
[20:04:36] <zetorian> I have called support once, they didn't notice.
[20:04:48] <zetorian> They just pinged my gateway and assumed it was theirs
[20:05:23] <JollyRgrs> all their diagnostic tools didn't error out?
[20:05:41] <JollyRgrs> b/c I thought the ONLY thing being passed through was the certificate auth stuff
[20:05:50] <zetorian> That is correct.
[20:06:11] <zetorian> But aside from that their routers aren't special
[20:06:32] <JollyRgrs> well not "special" but they have their own toolset that logs into it and views error logs, etc.
[20:06:45] <JollyRgrs> and sends reset signals to it
