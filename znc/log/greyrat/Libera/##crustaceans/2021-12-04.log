[00:01:42] <gwozniak> Church: I have takes. I just don't always use them ;)
[00:01:43] <companion_cube> how is that unpopular? :D
[00:01:55] <gwozniak> I liked Jagged Little Pill
[00:02:03] <manicennui> She did some great live performances during the pandemic.
[00:02:09] <gwozniak> Which is usually not in my wheelhouse
[00:02:13] <manicennui> During one of them her kid covered her mouth during part of the song.
[00:02:15] <manicennui> It was hilarious.
[00:02:23] <manicennui> She was on some big late night show or something.
[00:02:48] <companion_cube> waaaaaaaaa

[00:02:58] <manicennui> Kid has a great story to tell when they get older.
[00:04:34] <manicennui> It's at about 1:45
[00:06:15] <companion_cube> wow, didn't realize she still sang
[00:06:25] <manicennui> companion_cube: A lot of people seem to hate Alanis because of Ironic.
[00:06:40] <companion_cube> you mean, because of the lyrics?!
[00:06:48] <Church> She had this one track in Dogma I loved
[00:06:48] <manicennui> Yes.
[00:06:56] <manicennui> I love watching her sing.
[00:07:05] <manicennui> And I like her earlier albums.
[00:07:44] <manicennui> Her voice is amazing.
[00:08:36] <manicennui> Jagged Little Pill would have been ruined by modern production.
[00:22:59] <manicennui> I think JLP is a good example of an album that would be far worse today. They would have used far more generic dance beats and removed a lot of the idiosyncrasies from her voice.
[00:24:08] <manicennui> The instruments are not mind blowing or anything, but they sound good.
[00:24:16] <manicennui> And you can clearly hear them.
[00:25:53] <manicennui> There is even part of ironic where they did something with her voice in production.

[06:27:33] <imode> someone's getting PIP'd.
[06:27:38] <imode> and they totally deserve it
[06:27:47] <imode> you do not get to create more work for people and then dump it on us.
[06:33:35] <companion_cube> they're getting the python?
[06:33:46] <imode> performance improvement plan.
[06:33:55] <companion_cube> from within their virtual work environment?
[06:39:29] <imode> lmaoo.
[06:58:31] <imode> so, in "I don't know how these people breathe let alone code" news, I had someone complain about how they couldn't test their changes.
[06:58:49] <imode> that's pretty normal, our testing environments have gotten better over time, but they're still a little strange for newcomers.
[06:59:32] <imode> they mentioned that they "deployed their changes to this pipeline for testing".
[06:59:45] <imode> which, what, what changes, what pipeline, how did you do that, what did you do, what the fuck.
[07:00:04] <imode> so I asked that question. and it turns out... that they just yeeted it. they just yeeted code onto the box. they just fuckin yeeted it dude.
[07:01:21] <imode> they built a package set containing their changes in a particular branch of a package, _deployed_ that package set, and fired off a test event and complained that it didn't work, so they subsequently rolled it back.
[07:01:39] <imode> somehow they had the permissions to just like, deploy arbitrary shit! they could've deployed a Joomla page or some shit and we wouldn't have noticed until alarms started going off.
[07:02:57] <imode> their competence with the build and deployment system clashed with their incompetence of _fucking up a crucial pipeline that could result in a month long audit_.
[07:03:40] <imode> and it all cancelled out.
[07:04:24] <imode> y'all wonder why I'm bitey and burnt out. that's a single client. we have over 2k of them. roughly similar.
[07:13:00] <gwozniak> wow
[07:13:14] <imode> that's not even the worst thing that happened today, I didn't even have to do anything to fix that.
[07:13:38] <imode> no, the _worst_ thing that happened today was that a member of my team hit the "prune" button on a build. instead of fixing their changes, they broke the entire version set.
[07:13:45] <imode> _the entire. version set._
[07:13:52] <imode> pipelines stalled, packages don't build, all code reviews halt.
[07:13:56] <imode> and then they fucking dumped it.
[07:14:23] <imode> had a lovely conversation with my manager, basically saying "if I can _graph_ my grievances, they're objective. look into this or I will."
[07:15:12] <imode> I'm so glad I evolved from being chickenshit in the business space because I would've just not addressed or vocalized any of these when I started out.
[07:15:18] <imode> now I'm so pissed and glorified tenured.
[07:15:30] <imode> you'll have to remove my cold dead body from this position.

[07:26:55] <imode> this person just mic dropped.
[07:26:59] <imode> "later lmao"
[07:27:02] <Church> Yeah that's... not great
[07:29:34] <imode> not great is an understatement. I just want the behavior to stop. they caused 2 audits.
[07:35:54] <imode> part of all of this work is me rediscovering that I am a competent engineer. the summer of 2019 I basically contracted amnesia, and I've had to relearn "how to build shit" since then.
[07:36:03] <imode> this project is going obscenely well. way too well right now, actually.
[07:38:03] <imode> it handles faults in a nice and recoverable fashion, it provides easily extensible interfaces to the expert system, the actual inflow of data is very, very cheap, the data format is about as compact as I can make it, and it's generic enough to be used org-wide.
[07:38:15] <imode> it's independent enough that I could market it as an insights product.
[07:38:24] <imode> makes me feel like a real programmer again.

[07:56:00] <imode> I fancy Post Malone once and a while.
[07:56:10] <gwozniak> Maybe I can put it on in the background and see how I react
[08:05:12] <defect> i have garbage taste, but i honestly liked taylor swifts last two albums
[08:05:55] <imode> you can like pop music, it's okay.
[08:10:56] <defect> my gargabe taste extends to other mediums than music though :P

[16:49:47] <mouseghost> its not fitted perfectly
[16:49:53] <dimadima> just the glass?
[16:49:58] <mouseghost> dimadima, i think you could switch only the glass if you lcd works, yeah
[16:50:08] <dimadima> hmm
[16:50:13] <dimadima> it's fucked up to shit but maybe
[16:50:32] <mouseghost> but they didnt do it 100% correctly in my case so idk
[16:50:34] <mouseghost> but it works
[16:50:42] <mouseghost> its a bit too small on the sides eh
[16:51:39] <mouseghost> dimadima, you basically keep your original lcd panel and alllll
[16:51:45] <mouseghost> but change the glasss

[16:58:16] <mouseghost> efficacy?

[16:58:24] <dimadima> mouseghost: effectiveness?
[16:58:27] <mouseghost> hm
[16:58:29] <dimadima> how effective something is
[16:58:37] <mouseghost> but isnt it about the scratches?
[16:58:47] <mouseghost> how would a screen protector not be effective against scratches?
[16:58:52] <dimadima> i guess? if scratches lead to breaks then especially
[16:59:11] <dimadima> i don't know, they make sense to me
[16:59:18] <mouseghost> hm
[16:59:27] <mouseghost> theyre sometimes weird to tocuh
[16:59:43] <dimadima> but i hadn't even considered the scratches part, becuase they didnt annoy me too much. but now that i'm thinking about it, maybe scratches are what weaken the glass
[16:59:49] <dimadima> i like the weirdness
[16:59:56] <dimadima> at least of the one on my phone
[17:00:34] <mouseghost> i dont like the weirdness

[19:39:06] <ngoldbaum> adding type annotations to python was a mistake https://twitter.com/raymondh/status/1466893123943079941?s=21

[19:39:40] <ngoldbaum> you just can‚Äôt bolt this stuff on 20 years later without creating tons of corner cases it turns out :/
[19:39:57] <riv> what a crazy experiment

[21:28:32] <cb> jjuran: the french answer
[21:28:37] <cb> also, python was a mistake imho

[22:49:43] <companion_cube> gwozniak: why?
[22:50:41] <companion_cube> If you already have stakes in python (skills, code) it helps mitigating the issues
[22:54:17] <gwozniak> I'm all for type systems.  But bolting them on will almost certainly cause more trouble in the long run.  Better to start planning a migration, imo
[22:56:12] <companion_cube> someone should do a better language that produces compatible bytecode :)

[23:52:23] <manicennui> Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee is either fantastic or terrible, depending on the guest.
[23:53:07] <manicennui> I'm surprised they bother airing the episodes that are clearly duds.
