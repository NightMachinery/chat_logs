[09:54:04] <kares[m]> headius: no progress - I do not think I will find time to look into the JNR stuff anytime soon
[09:54:04] <kares[m]> feel free to re-target or close ...
[09:56:47] <kares[m]> fyi: still looking into the jossl issue - I ported some OpenSSL 1.1/1.0 verification logic that I though is the cause but seems I need to dig a bit deeper
[10:01:37] <kares[m]> headius: with https://github.com/jruby/jruby/pull/6679 I missed the obvious thing while changing the logic
[10:01:37] <kares[m]> ahorek's suggestions make the PR all ðŸ’š any chance to reconsider this for 9.3.1.0 ?
[15:40:50] <headius> Yeah u think so
[15:40:53] <headius> I think so
[21:02:01] <headius> enebo: not sure what to do about that gem push issue, we have not been able to reproduce but there are two reports of it
[21:13:49] <enebo[m]> headius: yeah I am not hitting it on linux either
[21:14:04] <enebo[m]> I figure it must be some env config doing something ssl we are not when we run it
[21:14:30] <headius> I'm giving it a try on a MacOS 11+ system now
[21:14:43] <headius> but it is M1 and I'm running x86_64 JDK so it is a little different than his env
[21:17:29] <enebo[m]> headius: I am going to change the mavenfile for jruby-jars to use 9.3.0.0
[21:17:41] <enebo[m]> #6263
[21:20:10] <headius> ok cool
[21:21:42] <enebo[m]> I think unless you discover something on the gem push issue we just release what we have
[21:32:06] <headius> enebo: no luck
[21:33:52] <enebo[m]> I think punting all PR/issues marked will be offset by people trying 9.3.1 more and getting us more stabil quicker
[21:34:18] <enebo[m]> several outstanding ones seems to be waiting on help or better repros too
[21:34:20] <headius> yes I am fine with pushing 9.3.1 out and trying to get more into 9.3.2
[21:34:29] <enebo[m]> yeah ok
[21:34:52] <headius> I was mostly trying to intelligently punt these last 20 or so knowing they wouldn't make 9.3.1
[21:35:02] <enebo[m]> I will spin some stuff today and make sure things are working.  we will do typical release stuff tomorrow
[21:35:02] <headius> this gem push thing was the one I wanted to get another try
[21:35:04] <headius> ok
[21:35:35] <enebo[m]> yeah that is one which I worry about since it is IO but if it is some combo with SSL then we already know we have some issues
