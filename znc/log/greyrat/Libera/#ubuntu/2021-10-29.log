[00:34:55] <BCB> I just ugraded to Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS and during the upgrade it said something about "software properties"  but that is not a command.  I thought the upgrade was telling me I could use this command to reinstall the software that was no longer compatable.  Any thoughts?

[00:38:21] <sarnold> aha
[00:38:23] <sarnold> that's more likely

[00:39:53] <tomreyn> BCB: no, that would be silly, right?
[00:40:24] <BCB> TomyLobo The upgrade side a bunch a packages would be removed and something about "Software Packages" to reinstall them.
[00:40:44] <tomreyn> TomyLobo: BCB wrote "no longer compatible" earlier, so that's pretty much the same as "incompatible"

You may re-enable these repositories once the release upgrade is complete, using the software-properties-* commands.

[06:25:15] <yukiup> there is ffmpeg to encode videos, but you still need something to pull the files off the disk
[06:25:56] <yukiup> https://www.miskatonic.org/2020/05/12/dvd-ffmpeg/
[06:26:45] <origintopleft> yukiup, i've gotten as far as installing dvdbackup and copying the correct titles off the disk, but part of my confusion is the number of VOB files don't match the number of titles.
[06:27:20] <yukiup> true
[06:27:27] <origintopleft> Specifically, this DVD has three episodes, and I only have two VOBs.

[06:27:58] <ravage> If you can access the machine over the network
[06:28:25] <yukiup> maybe its really only one vob?
[06:28:30] <origintopleft> if I had a GUI, I could theoretically load a big mega video into an editor and cut it by hand...but then I could also probably just use VLC.
[06:29:01] <yukiup> maybe you could check the timing
[06:29:11] <origintopleft> ravage, if I'm doing things like trying to access a DVD drive over the network then I consider the whole project a bust. it's a USB DVD drive, i might as well just plug it into my Windows PC and rip it there.
[06:29:47] <ravage> Then maybe do that
[06:29:50] <origintopleft> that's probably what I should be doing in the first place, but I was hoping to skip the whole "copy it to the media server" step and get it ripped ON the media server.

[16:55:11] <Kolusion> 2021 and it doesn't calculate it automatically, something Windows 95 did.
[16:55:25] <Kolusion> Anyone know what the subnet in CIDR format is for the IP address 192.168.0.4?
[16:58:51] <ravage> The IP can be part of any subnet
[16:59:02] <ravage> I assume you use a /24

[17:00:08] <Kolusion> All meaningless to me
[17:00:21] <ravage> Then educate yourself
[17:00:25] <alkisg> That's why it's not "automatically deduced from the ip"
