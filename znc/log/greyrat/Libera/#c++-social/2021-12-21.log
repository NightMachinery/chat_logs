[17:32:57] <jotham> summer christmas bbq ideas
[17:33:08] <jotham> i was thinking of poaching some chorizo then smoking it
[17:33:23] <jotham> and doing a bunch of chicken thighs with garlic powder / onion powder / brown sugar / salt
[17:33:27] <jotham> so they get a bark on them
[17:33:36] <jotham> but i'd like to do something else
[17:33:42] <T`aZ> duck
[17:33:43] <jotham> also i have 2 salads sorted
[17:33:57] <jotham> i've never ever tried to cook duck on a charcoal grill
[17:33:57] <T`aZ> home dried duck, takes a month, so it's already too late though
[17:34:01] <jotham> i feel like it'd go bad
[17:34:05] <jotham> i think some pork belly maybe
[17:34:23] <jotham> i am mostly aiming to produce things from the charcoal grill
[17:34:28] <T`aZ> ha
[17:34:29] <T`aZ> ribs
[17:34:36] <jotham> i was thinking lamb kofta
[17:34:39] <jotham> yeah ribs is a good idea
[17:34:42] <jotham> beef short ribs aye
[17:34:46] <jotham> that's a damn good idea
[17:34:51] <jotham> could marinate it the day before
[17:34:54] <jotham> well boil then sauce
[17:35:12] <jotham> i basically am imagining, since it'll rain
[17:35:19] <jotham> 28C 100% humidity
[17:35:25] <jotham> and me grilling 400 meats
[17:35:32] <jotham> and drinking approx 1 ton of beer
[17:35:40] <jotham> there will be 7 of us
[17:35:50] <jotham> so not all bad
[17:36:20] <jotham> those south african sausages are pretty good bauernwurst
[17:36:23] <T`aZ> lard, t-bone, lamb or goat
[17:36:27] <jotham> MaNI: mani plz advise
[17:36:35] <jotham> t-bone is very expensive, but really good
[17:36:40] <jotham> i think we should go sheep
[17:36:44] <jotham> since it's a national export here
[17:36:50] <jotham> fatty things work better on the coals
[17:37:04] <jotham> i don't get why people insist on buying expensive beef then grilling it
[17:37:10] <jotham> it's a crime against humanity
[17:37:13] <jotham> that shit is delicate
[17:37:40] <jotham> merry christmas, i turned a 28 dollar piece of incredible beef into cardboard
[17:37:56] <jotham> T`aZ: do you guys eat much goat?
[17:38:04] <T`aZ> you might want to not wait until it's 100% black though
[17:38:08] <jotham> we do a bit but it's dying out culturally
[17:38:17] <jotham> well i'm a fairly capable cook
[17:38:28] <jotham> i think i will wait until it's 100% black if it's required
[17:38:37] <jotham> for example- carbon storage
[17:38:53] <jotham> get some sweet eu credits from my christmas grill
[17:39:09] <jotham> too bad the charcoal we all grill with is made by deforesting the amazon
[17:39:12] <T`aZ> jotham: well not originally, but since there are black communities here, it's getting prepared/sold more and more, still limited though, a lot of people hev'nt even tasted goat ever
[17:39:26] <jotham> okay
[17:39:42] <jotham> i grew up with goats, i mean i grew up on a tiny rural farm at the end of the planet
[17:39:47] <jotham> we didn't eat it very often
[17:39:57] <jotham> but i have had indian goat curries a few times and they are very good
[17:40:03] <jotham> but goat is like asparagus 
[17:40:09] <jotham> it makes your pee smell fucking wild
[17:40:10] <T`aZ> we just drink their milk and make cheese with it, culturally eating them is not common
[17:40:19] <jotham> yeah goat cheese same here
[17:40:41] <jotham> goats and chickens were the first animals that could really survive on ships
[17:40:50] <jotham> so they are fucking everywhere
[17:41:16] <jotham> you know whales produce milk right
[17:41:22] <jotham> none of us have had whale cheese
[17:41:39] <jotham> whales and dolphins are the same, how do you express milk under water
[17:41:49] <jotham> they have a flap the baby has to stab its way into, cause of pressure, water, etc
[17:41:58] <jotham> to get this sludge, that is thicker than toothpaste
[17:42:00] <jotham> into them
[17:42:08] <jotham> i dunno how we'd milk them, let alone make cheese
[17:42:34] <jotham> https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dXipZPiTImc/hqdefault.jpg
[17:42:40] <jotham> it's inside a flap they nuzzle into
[17:43:00] <jotham> funny to think of whales and dolphins producing dairy, but it is what it is
[17:43:08] <T`aZ> hmmm, dophin cheese
[17:43:13] <jotham> hehehe
[17:43:31] <jotham> i listened to an audio series by a guy living in the arctic
[17:43:33] <jotham> from france
[17:43:40] <jotham> he said everything tastes fishy there
[17:43:45] <jotham> he had a pet chicken
[17:43:47] <jotham> and it ate fish
[17:43:52] <jotham> so the eggs he got tasted fishy
[17:44:01] <jotham> so i assume that cheese would be mad fishy
[17:44:09] <jotham> maybe the dutch would like it with some onions
[17:44:47] <jotham> it can't be any worse than sheep which i like
[17:44:53] <jotham> and goat which i find quite aggressive
[17:45:02] <jotham> sheep taste like the wet wool on their backs
[17:45:25] <jotham> a normal one, not one you get in a fancy restaurant
[17:45:52] *** Quits: CaCode_ (~CaCode@user/cacode) (Quit: Leaving)
[17:46:16] <T`aZ> goats also do smell and taste
[17:46:22] <jotham> goat feta is better than cow feta though i think
[17:46:26] <jotham> sharper and less oily
[17:46:47] <jotham> if i cook with feta i want it to be a kinda counter point to some roasted sweet rich flavor
[17:46:52] <jotham> like caramelized onions or nuts
[17:47:09] <jotham> so it's very good for that
[17:47:38] <jotham> walnuts and feta is really nice, even if walnuts are weirdly bitter
[17:48:02] <jotham> so you think sheep for christmas lunch?
[17:48:13] <jotham> i can do that, i think that's a good idea
[17:48:20] <jotham> chorizo, marinated chicken, and sheep
[17:48:26] <jotham> my friend is making a ham
[17:49:07] <T`aZ> sheep is full of fat though, prefer lamb
[17:49:07] <jotham> might make up for 2020 and 2021 being terrible years
[17:49:18] <jotham> and we learned today we're probably going to do what europe is doing
[17:49:23] <jotham> and going back into first lockdown again
[17:49:31] <T`aZ> fucking up basic liberties ?
[17:49:36] <jotham> well with the charcoal you want more fat rather than lean meat
[17:49:41] <T`aZ> ha, this is the new normal
[17:49:42] <jotham> or it dries out and gets tough
[17:50:07] <jotham> if you wanna cook lean meat, like rabbit or something
[17:50:11] <jotham> better off using the stove

[17:50:19] <jotham> but the idea is to enjoy the charcoal grilling

[17:50:38] <jotham> plus like i said it might even be sunny here
[17:50:48] <jotham> will definitely be over 20
[17:50:57] <jotham> nz summer doesn't really start till feb
[17:51:09] <jotham> we're in functional late spring
[17:51:13] <jotham> so humid and story
[17:51:16] <jotham> stormy
[17:52:26] <jotham> i think everyone wants this virus to be over, but the only way it's over is if people stop transmitting it
[17:52:42] *** Joins: hinst (~Username@ip5f5ad1c9.dynamic.kabel-deutschland.de)
[17:52:50] <jotham> but also everyone is very sick of the entire situation
[17:53:06] <T`aZ> no, this is the major error, it's never goign to be over, never
[17:53:10] <T`aZ> never
[17:53:20] <jotham> yes it will
[17:53:28] <Plazma> never gonna giiiiUUHHHIIIIIVVVVEEEEEEEEEEEEEE youuuuuuUUUUuuuoouuuu UUUUUUUUUUPPPPPPPPP
[17:53:35] <T`aZ> impossibruh!
[17:54:08] <jotham> at the start of the pandemic the scientists all said one simple thing- over time less dangerous more transmissive versions of viruses evolve and outbreed the niches of the more dangerous cousins
[17:54:22] <jotham> that's literally why we survived every other virus pandemic
[17:54:27] <T`aZ> this is game over, vaccine are not preventing transmission, yo cant stop this shit, it's there, everybody will catch it, weaks will die
[17:54:28] <jotham> and delta shows promise of being that
[17:54:44] <jotham> that's not really relevant to how evolution works
[17:55:07] <jotham> what happens is the niche of the virus gets taken over by another version of the virus that causes less long term damage to its host population
[17:55:15] <jotham> until it's like influenza or herpes
[17:55:28] <jotham> and omicron is the first step in that direction
[17:55:37] <jotham> the scientists explained this to us 2 years ago
[17:56:45] <jotham> it's weird to anthropomorphise it, that's half the problem
[17:57:02] <jotham> but the way it statistically works out is we all get a milder version of the virus over time
[17:57:20] <jotham> because that virus survives longer on more hosts to outbreed the rest of its competition
[17:57:38] <jotham> so it's not game over
[17:57:46] <jotham> but yes this next n years will be fucking terrible
[17:58:03] <jotham> and especially when you look at the infection and hospitalisation rates between vaxxed and unvaxxed
[17:58:05] <T`aZ> they dont have to be, but sadly population still wants this shit
[17:58:09] <jotham> the end of science is a more scary idea
[17:58:18] <jotham> which is what we're seeing with the unvaxxed
[17:58:51] <jotham> https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#rates-by-vaccine-status
[17:58:57] <T`aZ> i prefered when we talked about roasting sheep though
[17:59:16] <T`aZ> less angry/depressive thoughts :/
[17:59:18] <jotham> sure we're on other sides of the fence
[17:59:30] <jotham> but we're from different cultures
[17:59:54] <jotham> i think that medical science works when it's put to a good cause, rather than botox and fat reduction
[18:00:24] <jotham> the data on the rate of death and hospitalisation between vaxxed and unvaxxed is irrefutable 
[18:00:43] <jotham> and you have to be a madman to think every single country in the world is working together to fuck every single person in the world over
[18:00:54] <jotham> my country largely hates and does not trust everyone
[18:01:01] <jotham> same with south korea
[18:01:07] <jotham> and we still get the same data as europe
[18:02:03] <jotham> reality is social media has broken everyones minds and science still works
[18:02:46] <jotham> but i absolutely agree (see the irish contaminated blood scandal) that big pharma is in general evil
[18:03:20] <jotham> but right now every single scientific body on the planet from multiple competing poltiical and cultural ideologies are looking at the data and saying vaccination works
[18:03:27] <jotham> and everyone needs to stop being a dickhead
[18:04:10] <jotham> at a personal level, absolutely agree it's gone a bit fucking authoritarian, but this would all be over if people just followed the peer reviewed science
[18:05:10] <jotham> pharma companies are totally evil, but right now every country has all its scientists looking at them, and that's the real tragedy, they can do good work if they are held to it, it's just normally they do exploitative work
[18:05:33] <jotham> anyway sorry T`aZ, please make sure you and your loved ones are safe, but this could be over faster if people stopped being assholes
[18:06:14] <T`aZ> i dont agree :/
[18:07:34] <jotham> well what do you think the plan should be
[18:07:40] <jotham> and what's the scientific basis for it
[18:08:09] <jotham> do you disagree pharma companies are evil?
[18:08:25] <jotham> do you disagree our states have all gone a big authoritarian?
[18:08:29] <jotham> what do you disagree with
[18:09:05] <jotham> we've had over 100 years of proof that activating our immune system is the best solution to a pathogen like this
[18:09:09] <T`aZ> we already talked about this, the tldr version is, im against all restriction of liberties, killing 10% of the population is still better than what we are currently experiencing. I'm not even entering the scientific question
[18:09:12] <jotham> and have used it very successfully
[18:09:22] <jotham> okay
[18:09:38] <T`aZ> liberties and living a life are far, far more important
[18:09:47] <jotham> the only reason this is taking so long is because of people like you
[18:09:51] <jotham> it could have been over in 6 months
[18:10:03] <jotham> if everyone just stopped moving and the virus couldn't replicate
[18:10:10] <T`aZ> no, it was a non practical dream
[18:10:15] <jotham> well, world bank said 3 months
[18:10:18] <T`aZ> you cant do that :s
[18:10:23] <jotham> not really, we're all from rich countries
[18:10:27] <jotham> we could have done that
[18:10:33] <jotham> and it'd have done less economic damage than it has done
[18:10:37] <jotham> so everyone would have been richer
[18:11:01] <jotham> like you say, what does the death rate from economic suicide matter
[18:11:05] <jotham> if we just wiped it out in 3 months
[18:11:06] <T`aZ> this is bull, look at chine, they have the stricted lockdown, it's still fucking there
[18:11:08] <jotham> by staying home
[18:11:09] <T`aZ> china*
[18:11:22] <jotham> it's basically not there in terms of per cap 100k
[18:11:28] <jotham> because they did do it
[18:11:52] <jotham> taz the basic fact is that the virus works by spreading between people, right
[18:11:59] <jotham> and you said you're fine with people dying, right
[18:12:07] <jotham> so if we just stood still and all the weak ones died
[18:12:08] <T`aZ> the whole idea is non reachable, that's my point, i woudl not have tried anything
[18:12:10] <jotham> it would have died too
[18:12:13] <jotham> problem solved
[18:12:34] <T`aZ> except invest in vaccines and stuff, like they did, but without restricting liberties, that's my key point
[18:12:48] <jotham> i understand muh freedoms argument
[18:13:12] <jotham> i think the problem is probably that i come from a country where i can just run away from the government
[18:13:14] <T`aZ> it's not about muhh freedom, like americans are saying
[18:13:15] <jotham> and maybe you can't
[18:13:22] <jotham> cause it's still a bit feral here
[18:13:33] <T`aZ> it's about having a third ear of education completely fucked up for a whole generation
[18:13:46] <T`aZ> it's about small stored getting shutdown, people it's forbidden to go there
[18:13:47] <Renderwww> "is probably that i come from a country where i can just run away from the government" unless you are in dept-prison
[18:13:50] <T`aZ> stores*
[18:13:55] <jotham> so for you, it's about kids getting good schooling?
[18:14:05] <T`aZ> it's about depression because you are bored out of your minde
[18:14:13] <jotham> Renderwww: naah i could just go live with my dad
[18:14:23] <jotham> Renderwww: i could run away from it, but i still want to be part of it, sadly
[18:14:25] <jotham> haha
[18:14:35] <Renderwww> how many people actually got infected while grocery shopping? by now they should have some data on that, right?
[18:14:39] <jotham> i'm doing my well deserved time
[18:14:42] <jotham> not being enforced
[18:14:58] <jotham> delta got 90 people infected at my local store
[18:15:04] <jotham> within 45 mnutes each way
[18:15:10] <jotham> we have very good scanning / testing
[18:15:15] <jotham> and it's quite alarming
[18:15:18] <T`aZ> it's about having to justify yourself whenever you want you want to try to do something outside your house
[18:15:25] <jotham> and omicron when it breaks out will fuck our country
[18:15:25] <T`aZ> this is full retardness
[18:15:30] <jotham> so we're all a bit concerned about that
[18:15:36] <jotham> even with our 91% vax rate
[18:15:47] <T`aZ> ho it will, look at our numbers
[18:15:52] <jotham> yep
[18:16:00] <jotham> and a person escaped from hospital last night here
[18:16:05] <jotham> from our isolation
[18:16:26] <jotham> but also it started at least 2 weeks before any country picked it up
[18:16:30] <jotham> so it's already everywhere
[18:17:12] <jotham> i think T`aZ is starting to feel what a normal introvert feels
[18:17:21] <jotham> i don't even go to the same shop most days for the same thing
[18:17:31] <jotham> incase someone thinks i've got a pattern of behaviour
[18:17:34] <jotham> and that's before covid
[18:17:45] <jotham> people already live this way, i know two other people that are the same
[18:17:52] <jotham> society is already generally shit
[18:18:33] <jotham> that's my own mental health problem, but it's not uncommon
[18:18:48] <jotham> T`aZ: so the problem is that you don't want to be told what to do, right?
[18:18:53] <jotham> or am i oversimplifying it
[18:19:02] <T`aZ> the short version yes
[18:19:02] <jotham> i genuinely can break the law a lot here in nz
[18:19:11] <jotham> and i don't know why other people don't think they can
[18:19:31] <jotham> i lived in netherlands and people were a lot more weird about breaking the law
[18:19:41] <jotham> and i wondered if it was cause they had been ruled over for so long
[18:19:43] <T`aZ> i already had a limited number of passion in life, all are gone/fucked up since 2y, this is unacceptable
[18:19:44] <jotham> before democracy
[18:19:59] <jotham> yeah but it wasn't the government that did it
[18:20:04] <T`aZ> it's the german culture
[18:20:09] <T`aZ> there is a law, you respect it
[18:20:22] <jotham> yeah that's what i found funny and enjoyable about them
[18:20:35] <jotham> definitely not nz culture but it made me feel comfortable
[18:20:41] <jotham> cause at least i knew what the rules were
[18:20:42] <T`aZ> go south, starting from belgium, then france, italy. it's the latin culture, you dont care until you really have to
[18:21:07] <jotham> you mean you are a burgundian?!
[18:21:14] <jotham> i have heard about your feckless empire
[18:21:19] <jotham> haha (read about it)
[18:22:04] <jotham> the real simple thing is this
[18:22:20] <jotham> all the countries on earth can't even agree what to do about climate change or palestine
[18:22:27] <jotham> but they all agree these medicines are safe
[18:22:38] <jotham> take the medicine, and that's it
[18:23:10] <jotham> it's peer reviewed and tested to fuck, and pharma companies are evil
[18:24:40] <jotham> i think we're all fed up and want our freedoms back
[18:24:59] <jotham> i'm having christmas with a friend because (in nz terms) i'm in their bubble
[18:25:11] <jotham> they have a sick kid and a new baby that will be born any day now
[18:25:26] <jotham> i wont go home to see mum and her boyfriend
[18:25:32] <jotham> since they are both having chemo
[18:25:42] <jotham> which is weird and fucked up
[18:25:45] <jotham> i think we're all over this
[18:26:32] <Renderwww> ya'll should have opted for the social-retard gene like me
[18:26:39] <jotham> but people saying this is fascism or whatever have to realise global industry could have given us all a 3 month pay break and basically killed the virus off, the economist said it'd have cost 0.01% of gdp
[18:26:44] <jotham> but they didn't
[18:26:48] <jotham> the enemy isn't the state
[18:26:58] <jotham> it's business and it's 3% PA growth rate
[18:27:47] <jotham> virus literally spreads because we can't be fucked with being imprisoned
[18:28:36] <jotham> trump came out yesterday with bill orielly and they both said the vaccine was made by trump and they had both had boosters
[18:28:43] <jotham> and it went down like a cup of cold sick
[18:28:57] <jotham> if you're the antithesis you have to always be the antithesis or you lose power
[18:29:23] <jotham> T`aZ: my advice is move here
[18:29:34] <jotham> we've basically had the most normal life in the world short of sweden
[18:29:44] <jotham> but we don't have a lot of muslims like sweden, your choice
[18:29:50] <T`aZ> yes, i've heard about that
[18:30:08] <jotham> haha so i put the news on last week
[18:30:14] <jotham> and this guy was shouting to the reporter
[18:30:22] <jotham> that nz is short of 86 skilled halal butchers
[18:30:30] <jotham> implying we might have 86 shit ones, right
[18:30:30] <T`aZ> but your culture is derived from uk/usa, i cant support that way :p
[18:30:46] <jotham> and i was thinking, i don't think that's a good use of our limited migration program
[18:30:55] <jotham> that's rude T`aZ 
[18:30:56] <T`aZ> s/support/live/
[18:31:02] <jotham> we're derived from UK/polynesia
[18:31:05] <jotham> we're not very american
[18:31:10] <jotham> other than being colonial
[18:31:13] <T`aZ> yeah, but still uk
[18:31:15] <T`aZ> full retard
[18:31:18] <jotham> we're definitely derived from the UK
[18:31:22] <T`aZ> yes it's rude, sorry
[18:31:34] <jotham> can't refute that
[18:31:43] <jotham> aussie is way more american than we are
[18:31:49] <jotham> we're more polynesian/british
[18:32:01] <T`aZ> i dont have opinions on polynesian :p
[18:32:17] <T`aZ> too fscking far away
[18:32:20] <jotham> they were the single greatest pre european colonial empire in the pacific
[18:32:43] <T`aZ> i should read more
[18:32:51] <jotham> no way
[18:32:56] <T`aZ> no ?
[18:32:57] *** Quits: Donno (~Donno@58.84.206.182) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[18:32:58] <jotham> it'll get in the way of your opinions
[18:33:09] <T`aZ> see
[18:33:11] <T`aZ> this
[18:33:12] <T`aZ> exactly this
[18:33:24] <jotham> more i read the more i am unsure about what opinion i should have
[18:33:25] <T`aZ> normal people are able to read stuff they are not agreeing with :p
[18:33:33] <jotham> yes absolutely
[18:33:33] <T`aZ> but uk, nop, it seems :p
[18:33:42] <jotham> i read a book 2 years ago trying to understand feminism
[18:33:51] <jotham> about a human and an alien in a tent on an ice planet
[18:33:51] *** Joins: Donno (~Donno@58.84.206.182)
[18:33:54] <jotham> and the alien was gay
[18:33:58] <jotham> and it was a very good book
[18:33:59] <jotham> but i hated it
[18:34:01] <jotham> haha
[18:34:02] <T`aZ> yeah but feminism is crap
[18:34:05] <jotham> i read things i hate all the time
[18:34:08] <T`aZ> nazi stuff
[18:34:11] <jotham> i think it's mentally healthy
[18:34:16] <jotham> wait wait wait
[18:34:22] <T`aZ> tons of political behind what was once maybe a good cause
[18:34:42] <T`aZ> by nazi i mean extremist
[18:34:49] <jotham> left wing identitarianism, as in you are a member of a class of identity, is definitely crap
[18:34:49] <T`aZ> not actual kill jew
[18:34:57] <jotham> but that's not what normal feminism is
[18:35:21] <jotham> you have to remember until the early 1900s women weren't allowed to own property in most of europe
[18:35:31] <jotham> you can't say shit like that about feminism
[18:35:43] <T`aZ> im all for equality where it applies
[18:35:46] <jotham> ignore america for a second
[18:35:53] <jotham> lets roll it back before you got on the internet
[18:35:53] <T`aZ> where it can apply*
[18:35:58] <jotham> feminism was, and still is
[18:36:12] <jotham> that women have the equal right to opportunity and legal representation as men
[18:36:16] <jotham> you agree with that
[18:36:20] <jotham> that makes you a feminist
[18:36:21] <T`aZ> now trying to say sex doent exist, females are as physically strong as male, is full retard
[18:36:26] <jotham> most christians don't agree with that
[18:36:35] <jotham> because the womans place is in the home
[18:36:38] <jotham> that's all feminism is
[18:36:46] <jotham> it's not whatever weird internet shit you got told
[18:36:48] <jotham> remember that
[18:37:22] <jotham> the gender/sex thing has very little to do with feminism
[18:37:28] <jotham> and a lot of feminists are against it
[18:37:29] <T`aZ> yeah so the definition needs to go back to what it was intended, equal rights and stuff
[18:37:35] <jotham> you've been on the internet too much
[18:37:41] <jotham> don't let america poison your brain
[18:37:49] <T`aZ> it's not only in america
[18:37:52] <jotham> feminism is literally that women have the same structural power as men
[18:37:59] <T`aZ> it's in my street, it's in my politicians
[18:37:59] <jotham> and has nothing to do with the gender/sex stuff
[18:38:13] <jotham> please read what i said
[18:38:19] <jotham> feminism is way older
[18:38:45] <jotham> the female sex only recently got the right to hold land and vote, let alone be culturallyr respected
[18:39:05] <jotham> you're disrespecting feminism by conflating it with gender identity politics
[18:39:13] <jotham> just ignore gender identity politics
[18:39:16] <jotham> you're too old for it
[18:39:18] <jotham> so am i
[18:39:42] <T`aZ> maybe yes
[18:39:43] <jotham> but you can support the idea a person of the female sex should be respected and have equal rights to you
[18:39:46] <jotham> that is feminism
[18:39:48] <jotham> that's it
[18:39:50] <jotham> that's all it is
[18:40:05] <jotham> ignore the gender politics of the internet
[18:40:16] <jotham> don't complicate it for yourself
[18:40:32] <jotham> and lots of women will thank you for not complicating it
[18:40:40] <T`aZ> it's so obvious i dont evenn understand how there is a debate around that
[18:40:46] <jotham> and if you're trying to fuck kids, well then sure you have political problems
[18:40:53] <jotham> sure
[18:40:55] <jotham> so why bother
[18:40:58] <jotham> that's my point
[18:41:02] <jotham> ignore it
[18:41:21] <jotham> i don't get why all these middle aged white blokes are angry about young people having controversial views
[18:41:36] <jotham> in our frame of refrence it's simple- women in our grandparents generation had no rights
[18:41:39] <jotham> and they do now
[18:41:41] <jotham> and that's good
[18:41:46] <T`aZ> we agree
[18:41:51] <jotham> and we don't have to worry about the new ideas about sex and politics
[18:41:57] <jotham> we're too old for that
[18:42:00] <T`aZ> we do, it's the new nazism
[18:42:12] <T`aZ> where you cant express your opinion anymore
[18:42:24] <jotham> yeah that's a more complicated topic though
[18:42:45] <jotham> this guy https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_J._Russell
[18:42:49] <jotham> read his top blurb
[18:42:52] <T`aZ> where you even have to approve somebody else's opinion, otherwise you are automatically in the opposite side. there is full bad or full good, nothing in the middle
[18:42:54] <jotham> some massive fucking nerd
[18:42:56] <T`aZ> and that is scary
[18:43:11] <jotham> he said the machine learning makes us more simple by making us outraged, so we're easier to solve for
[18:43:19] <jotham> does what you are saying affect your life
[18:43:24] <jotham> genuine question
[18:43:26] <T`aZ> and this is full of political bullshit, reusing good causes, to implement their agenda
[18:43:28] <jotham> this thing you're hot about
[18:43:33] <jotham> does it affect your life
[18:43:52] <T`aZ> not yet
[18:43:57] <jotham> no no
[18:43:58] <T`aZ> it will though
[18:44:02] <T`aZ> my kids
[18:44:03] <jotham> you're very concerned about it right
[18:44:06] <jotham> but right now
[18:44:10] <jotham> does it affect your life
[18:44:26] <T`aZ> no, but that's not how i think -_-
[18:44:50] <jotham> so that guy i just linked
[18:45:02] <jotham> check his bio please, he's a very smart mother fucker
[18:45:17] <jotham> he said the ML currently on the internt is actually fixing us into terror and outrage states
[18:45:26] <jotham> because it's cheaper for the machine to rationalise about
[18:45:39] <jotham> so where are you getting these ideas, that don't affect you, that you are under siege
[18:45:41] <jotham> or will be soon
[18:46:16] <jotham> are you finding them by reading good literature
[18:46:22] <jotham> or your interaction with friends and family
[18:46:32] <T`aZ> it has reached family members
[18:46:53] <T`aZ> it's no longer a wierdo on the internet
[18:47:03] <jotham> also who are 'they' 'their'
[18:47:20] <jotham> whos agenda is you being angry serving
[18:47:29] <jotham> *whose
[18:47:53] <jotham> i mean sure, this culture of outrage is everywhere
[18:48:01] <jotham> but i don't get why everyone takes sides on it
[18:48:15] <jotham> when it's probably all manufactured and largely doesn't affect our lives
[18:48:41] <T`aZ> this is a good question, i think it's a way of thinking, that is supposed to be good, but is in fact terribad. Lots of people are taking part in it, thinking it's the right thing to do
[18:48:46] <jotham> who do you think the enemy is
[18:48:47] <T`aZ> think likek twitter shaming
[18:48:51] <T`aZ> -k
[18:49:18] <jotham> sure there is a pedigree of leftists doing weird shaming shit
[18:49:22] <jotham> and cancel culture etc
[18:49:31] <jotham> and it's annoying they don't realise they aren't actually fascists
[18:49:35] <T`aZ> yes, that is probably the main issue
[18:49:40] <jotham> (as much as any other ardent group)
[18:50:08] <jotham> when trump got covid
[18:50:15] <jotham> i had an arugment with some prick in this channel
[18:50:20] <T`aZ> i think it's a movement without a master behind it
[18:50:25] <jotham> saying look i'm quite left wing, well some kind of 
[18:50:31] <jotham> and he said well i hope trump dies
[18:50:33] <T`aZ> but politicians and other powerfull people will use it
[18:50:38] <jotham> and i said why would you want any human to die
[18:50:39] <jotham> and he said
[18:50:43] <jotham>  BUT IT'S TRUMP
[18:50:48] <jotham> and i found that very hard work to process
[18:50:54] <jotham> i don't think you should wish people to die
[18:50:56] <jotham> seems bad
[18:50:58] <jotham> haha
[18:51:03] <jotham> if that's where rational discourse has got to
[18:51:08] <jotham> anyway after that
[18:51:16] <jotham> i encountered it from dozens of other people
[18:51:20] <jotham> i dunno about europe
[18:51:27] <jotham> but nz is like the uk i think
[18:51:33] <jotham> we don't really like our politicians
[18:51:39] <jotham> it's like the worst bad thing
[18:51:48] <jotham> so i find americas god complex with their leaders scary
[18:52:47] <jotham> do you think people are supposed to be good T`aZ 
[18:52:58] <jotham> i think our civilisation proves we're cooperative
[18:53:03] <jotham> which means we're largely good
[18:53:08] <jotham> doesn't mean we're supposed to be good
[18:53:13] <jotham> that might be a christian idea
[18:53:40] <jotham> we get together in massive quantities and largely look after the rules that let us survive together
[18:54:05] <T`aZ> recent events had me change my mind about this
[18:54:13] <T`aZ> humans are selfish fucks
[18:54:18] <T`aZ> so i became one too
[18:54:32] <jotham> man the pandemic has flipped my head on people
[18:54:35] <jotham> not individuals
[18:54:38] <jotham> but the whole thing
[18:54:47] <T`aZ> they are only good with a select group, kinda close to their environment, but that's about it
[18:55:18] <T`aZ> all the rest can go fuck themself. and I do *now* beleive that most of humans are thinking/doing the same
[18:55:37] <jotham> when i went to europe
[18:55:49] <jotham> i only lived in netherlands for 3 years and germany for 2 years
[18:56:04] <jotham> but i got the impression that society was mostly complaint and socialism made sense to me
[18:56:16] <jotham> which made me think nz was feckless
[18:56:20] <jotham> and a bit rudderless
[18:56:36] <jotham> but this pandemic i've been quite surprised how complaint my country has been
[18:56:48] <jotham> i still don't really know what to think about it
[18:57:06] <T`aZ> define complaint
[18:57:14] <jotham> well
[18:57:24] <jotham> we'd happily ram a cop car on a road
[18:57:28] <jotham> and scream about our rights
[18:57:40] <T`aZ> lol wtf
[18:57:43] <jotham> but also as soon as we know we're fucked we just calm down and go through with the court process
[18:58:01] <jotham> yeah so
[18:58:11] <jotham> i thought nz was a way more wild place than nl and de
[18:58:23] <jotham> cause of the way we generally don't have this european rule set mind
[18:58:28] <jotham> but now the pandemic is on
[18:58:38] <jotham> europe is sparking off constantly with protests
[18:58:40] <jotham> and nz is like
[18:58:52] <jotham> mate, i'm trying to buy milk, can you stand two fucking meters back
[18:58:57] <jotham> and put your mask on please, you cunt
[18:59:01] <T`aZ> given the gravity of the measures, and the amount of demonstration, it's very weak though
[18:59:03] <jotham> and that's a day to day real exchange
[18:59:12] <jotham> so it's like europe is less organised than i thought
[18:59:19] <jotham> and we're more compliant with the rules than i thought
[18:59:28] <T`aZ> ha
[18:59:39] <T`aZ> well, it's going downhill globally
[18:59:46] <jotham> yep
[18:59:52] <jotham> this is gonna be the kicker
[19:01:02] <T`aZ> the good thing is that we can be prepared, by comparing to shittier contries, what's it gonna be like in 20years
[19:01:12] <T`aZ> like, usa, for example
[19:01:48] <jotham> so you know how i said, we don't need to worry about the medicine companies lying to us, cause all these countries that usually hate each other are sharing data and it seems fine
[19:02:01] <T`aZ> it seems like politicians are just trying to be slighly "superior" to the rest of the world, but the global situation is still getting shittier by the day
[19:02:01] <jotham> i think that's what we're gonna get out of this pandemic, as the silver lining
[19:02:04] <jotham> we can work together
[19:02:25] <jotham> haha
[19:02:31] <jotham> yeah that's the elephant in the room aye
[19:02:40] <jotham> i reckon, all of us are looking at america
[19:02:42] <jotham> and going
[19:02:48] <jotham> what the actual fuck
[19:02:56] <jotham> it's quite weird
[19:03:30] <jotham> the weird thing is americans always think the world is theoretical
[19:03:37] <jotham> so what we all do together doesn't matter
[19:03:54] <jotham> nz being so small, we always try to do things with other countries
[19:04:26] <jotham> i think americas fuck up will help create the UN army
[19:04:37] <jotham> er EU army
[19:04:47] <T`aZ> there is one
[19:05:08] <T`aZ> i mean, several, from each country
[19:05:32] <jotham> i think it's funny after ww2 germany was told it can't have an army then made the leopard 2
[19:05:35] <T`aZ> with global direction
[19:05:39] <jotham> which everyone promptly purchased
[19:05:48] <jotham> i guess if you're making cars you may as well make tanks
[19:06:25] <jotham> so i don't speak any language other than english so this fucks me up on this
[19:06:37] <jotham> but i kind of hope europe swings center right but also more worker oriented
[19:06:41] <Oxyd> With a bit of luck, the west will fall under totalitarianism, a new iron curtain will be created, and we'll stop being influenced by their idiotic ideas.
[19:06:43] <jotham> so zero hour contracts are gone
[19:06:54] <jotham> like less UK liberal
[19:06:58] <jotham> maybe more church and state
[19:07:02] <jotham> and you guys galvanise
[19:07:14] <jotham> it'd be very dumb for the EU to break up over american politics
[19:07:19] <jotham> identity politics*
[19:07:24] <T`aZ> eu wont break up lol
[19:07:37] <jotham> i mean that's russias P1 though aye
[19:08:10] <Oxyd> That's quite an optimistic view.
[19:08:20] <jotham> i've spent my entire life with a dying UK and a stifling USA which i think is why i'm this weird pro european foreinger
[19:09:35] <jotham> i assume all the cultural division, that even T`aZ feels is driven by foreign money rather than local bureaucratic isolation
[19:09:52] <jotham> most people most of the time just want to get along
[19:10:00] <T`aZ> not sure what you mean
[19:10:17] <T`aZ> about cultural division
[19:10:34] <jotham> i only know two belgians
[19:13:13] <jotham> well you represented what i would think were american ideas, like ensuring approval of your opinion from the other side
[19:13:23] <jotham> it's the american left driving that idea right now
[19:13:41] <jotham> but you're right it's spreading everywhere
[19:14:08] <jotham> i think the core problem is that we have all this american media we consume
[19:14:12] <jotham> i mean some of it's great
[19:14:31] <jotham> but it always has a subtext or a context of american values
[19:14:53] <jotham> so, my country, has suffered it, europe must have suffered it
[19:15:15] <jotham> we're kinda locked into american values through our software
[19:15:19] <jotham> and our social language
[19:15:22] <jotham> and HR
[19:15:24] <jotham> and our jobs
[19:15:29] <jotham> it's very annoying
[19:15:35] <jotham> I INSTALLED GIT ON WINDOWS LAST WEEK
[19:15:51] <Raziel> congraturation, you done it!
[19:15:51] <jotham> and it questioned me if i wanted to rename the default for master branch
[19:16:06] <jotham> and it didn't say do you want to set master to something else
[19:16:19] <jotham> it had a paragraph about how some teams have chosen to use other terms instead of master
[19:16:26] <jotham> and this was during the installer
[19:16:43] <jotham> we're being colonized by west coast american values
[19:17:05] <jotham> also the worst bit is i get it a lot and then i go to meetings in my country with foreigners, people from my country
[19:17:07] <T`aZ> it's full of bullshit
[19:17:14] <jotham> and i realise none of them care, or know what it is
[19:17:17] <Raziel> >values
[19:17:21] <T`aZ> til, PC is west coast american
[19:17:25] <jotham> i'm the only alien being indoctrinated by california
[19:17:33] <jotham> because i have to use this software
[19:17:49] <Raziel> misconstruing words to mean whatever might be somewhat close to something that offends someone is hardly a value
[19:18:04] <jotham> can you put that in simple english Raziel 
[19:18:11] <jotham> in a way that is contributing
[19:18:44] <jotham> i'm being face fucked by californian ideas i don't agree with, and that's normal because i have to deal with the absolute economic hegemony of their culture
[19:18:51] <jotham> no i wont put that into simple english
[19:19:33] <dukwon> if you have a masters degree you're a fucking racist piece of shit
[19:19:36] <jotham> the most pernicious form of it is, HR teams in my country are copying american HR jargon
[19:20:02] <Raziel> jotham, I'm saying I don't even consider them values or ideas. It feels more like if the warnings in /Wall were written by a committee that was 8 years old and never had a dictionary or the spec docs
[19:20:02] <jotham> dukwon is notorious for ensuring particles only spin in a way that produces white light
[19:20:41] <T`aZ> white light matters
[19:21:04] <Raziel> normally I'd think it's people shitposting, but no, apparently whitelist and blacklist are bad words, even though they have absolutely nothing to do with people's skin colors
[19:21:36] <jotham> < dukwon> 6000k bitches :D 
[19:21:56] <jotham> Raziel: i don't know how that's a helpful idea
[19:22:08] <jotham> Raziel: your enemy might have an iq of 11 but still have values
[19:22:16] <jotham> Raziel: you don't have to judge them on your terms
[19:22:23] <jotham> Raziel: thats actively stupid
[19:22:56] <Raziel> jotham, the problem is, when you apply your values to random unrelated shit, you're diluting your values and you're wasting effort on irrelevant things
[19:23:02] <jotham> this 11 iq person is dumb, is that what you said
[19:23:25] <jotham> nope
[19:23:36] <dukwon> the real 'woke' thing should be to reject the idea of race, since it was invented to justify racism
[19:23:42] <jotham> you could just say within the confines of their reality this is their morality, and become more considered
[19:23:57] <dukwon> but they seem to be taking the whole concept as a given and going along with it
[19:24:11] <Renderwww> phew, good thing I have only a diploma and not a masters degree
[19:24:19] <Raziel> jotham, within the confines of my reality I find it hard to be considerate towards obscene lack of logic
[19:24:27] <Raziel> but I do try, to some extent. v:
[19:24:38] <jotham> Raziel: the point was you have to think within the confines of their reality
[19:24:44] <jotham> they still have the same machine as you
[19:24:48] <jotham> you have two choices
[19:24:55] <jotham> rationalise on their terms, or not have an opinion
[19:25:11] <jotham> having an opinion on people you refuse to empathetically engage with is dumb
[19:25:17] <jotham> just don't bother having an opinion mate
[19:25:23] <jotham> it's good 99% of the time
[19:25:27] <dukwon> identifying 'black' with 'anyone of sub-saharan african heritage' (whatever your intentions) is playing into the hands of those 17th century caribbean slave-owners who wanted to stop their irish and african workers from uniting
[19:25:57] <Raziel> I don't think I've ever met an actual person who shared the opinion of "master" or "blacklist" and "whitelist" being problematic terms within software
[19:26:10] <jotham> they aren't
[19:26:10] <Raziel> I'd be happy to empathetically engage with it if I did v:
[19:26:17] <dukwon> those people only exist in tweets and github comments
[19:26:21] <jotham> you're inventing an enemy
[19:26:28] <jotham> and that enemy is corporate america
[19:26:29] <Renderwww> easy way to keep those people away from your open source project,use the proper loicense: https://plusnigger.autism.exposed/
[19:26:34] <jotham> who will pay you a lot of money
[19:26:42] <jotham> it's very weird in my country because no one cares
[19:26:44] <Raziel> I'm not inventing anything more than I've been told exists from "announcements" and "new guidelines"
[19:26:49] <jotham> but the HR people still nudge us away from it
[19:27:00] <jotham> you are inventing a huge set of concerns
[19:27:07] <dukwon> it's all russian troll farms sowing discontent in the west
[19:27:11] <Raziel> you're assuming I'm actually concerned :p
[19:27:17] <jotham> that probably don't exist because you never met anyone (your words) that have a problem with it
[19:27:21] <jotham> so you're inventing it
[19:27:29] <jotham> at least in your economic reality
[19:27:35] <jotham> in your fantasy you're an american
[19:27:42] <jotham> and they care what you think
[19:27:50] <Raziel> I'm confused as to what you think I'm arguing for/against
[19:27:54] <Raziel> for the most part I was agreeing with you :p
[19:28:09] <dukwon> being a mercian > being american
[19:28:10] <jotham> well this is awkward
[19:28:13] <jotham> someone has to be wrong
[19:28:14] <Raziel> lol
[19:28:17] <jotham> hehe
[19:28:38] <Renderwww> in my experience in the end pretty much everyone is wrong
[19:28:49] <jotham> agreed
[19:29:03] <jotham> dukwon: do you reckon
[19:29:06] <Raziel> I'm also european so the whole situation reads as relatively foreign to me too
[19:29:32] <jotham> dukwon: here in nz we had these huge organizers on telegram and whatsapp, two progams i don't know if i've used more than getting a pizza?
[19:29:47] <jotham> and they realised whne they thought they'd have a 100k covid lockdown march
[19:29:52] <jotham> (there was no covid lockdown)
[19:29:57] <jotham> and only 2k people turned up
[19:30:09] <jotham> they realised these telegram and whatsapp groups were all foreigners
[19:30:14] <jotham> now they are even more paranoid
[19:30:20] <jotham> but the problem is
[19:30:24] <jotham> it wasn't the GRU
[19:30:27] <jotham> or APT-21
[19:30:30] <jotham> or whatever
[19:30:41] <jotham> it was literally fat white fuck americans and aussies egging them on
[19:30:47] <jotham> so we're as bad as each other
[19:30:59] <jotham> dumbest timeline, right
[19:31:02] <jotham> that's what we're on
[19:32:42] <Renderwww> it could always be dumber
[19:32:52] <jotham> would be super awkward if the fall of the west is lack of faith in science brought on by smart phones
[19:33:18] *** Quits: nojhan (uid443807@id-443807.lymington.irccloud.com) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[19:33:47] <jotham> is there even one of those fancy scifi terms for that
[19:34:05] <jotham> like a great filter
[19:34:22] <jotham> yeah you all get to talk to each other, turns out it sucks, then your species dies out
[19:34:40] <jotham> sid meier didn't have that on his fucking bingo card
[19:36:08] <Renderwww> do modern civ games have "social media" inventions?
[19:36:16] <Raziel> I do wonder if the whole global comms situation and social media and whatnot actually makes the problem worse, or if it only makes it more visible
[19:36:21] <jotham> christ that sounds criminal Raziel 
[19:36:33] <MaNI> why not both
[19:36:55] <jotham> hello jort king
[19:37:25] <jotham> mani is the peoples coloniser
[19:38:05] <jotham> Raziel: so i listened to a lecture this week by stuart russel, one of the contemporary fathers of AI
[19:38:18] <jotham> Raziel: he said he thinks machines are optimizing to make us more predictable
[19:38:25] <jotham> Raziel: and that outrage is very predictable
[19:38:43] <jotham> Raziel: so society is being homogenized by outrage because it's a simple solution for all the ad networks
[19:38:51] <Raziel> truly outrageous
[19:38:59] <jotham> so our polarisation isn't because any of us care about fuck whatever
[19:39:12] <jotham> but becasue that makes us more managable, our terms are simpler to rationalise about
[19:39:15] <jotham> it was fairly bleak
[19:39:23] <jotham> also
[19:39:26] <jotham> these are ad bots
[19:39:31] <jotham> haha
[19:39:33] <jotham> that's the fucker
[19:39:51] <jotham> imagine being simplified by an ad bot, multiple girlfriends wished this curse on me
[19:39:54] <jotham> and it's here
[19:40:45] <jotham> i think it might be a true statement that a healthy human may make a variety of choices but a sick human will definitely make fewer choices
[19:41:56] <jotham> especially if you crunch that over a million years, if we have that much time left
[19:42:19] <jotham> no reason ML wont just employ evolution against us
[19:45:16] <jotham> this is the lecture, ignore the stupid guy at the start, i didn't realise he was so fucking funny https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uY-u1qyRM5w
[19:45:54] <jotham> feynman is one of the best humans we've had recently aye
[19:46:40] <jotham> he just talks about fucking with the US govt while they built the bomb
[19:46:47] <jotham> which is hilarious
[19:48:22] <jotham> i like the idea the army had to decode his wifes messages to him to work out if they had to censor them
[19:48:29] <jotham> and she came up with weirder and weirder shit
[19:54:20] <hinst> w i f e
[20:38:48] <markuskj> wife eye

[21:01:22] <Renderwww> and so the erosion of higher education continued
[21:01:33] <Faux>  um
[21:27:02] <Bullit> Do you think the removal of nationalism has led to have all gone a big authoritarian
[21:29:18] <Bullit> I really feld humiliated when it was about a russian politician his fotos of naked ladies which exchange money for completing awards system while doing it
