[17:09:29] <Celelibi> Hey guys, I was reading about planning with lifted fluents and actions.
[17:11:20] <Celelibi> If I understand correctly, a ground fluent is like a functor term associated with a boolean for each state. Right?
[17:12:25] <Celelibi> t I'm not sure how actions are different.
[17:19:12] <DouglasRMiles[m]> Fluents are facts that are expected to change as actions take place
[17:20:46] <DouglasRMiles[m]> i suppose a boolean can represent a grounded flunet
[17:21:07] <DouglasRMiles[m]> s/flunet/fluent/
[17:22:11] <DouglasRMiles[m]> so you are correct in what you said
[17:27:56] *** Joins: sennomo (sennomo@cpe-108-183-47-81.stny.res.rr.com)
[18:13:40] <Celelibi> Ah yes. I just got it. Actions are what turn a state into another. Usually associated with pre and post-conditions. Which are expressed as fluents.
[18:14:31] <pikrzysztof> is purity somewhere in this picture? Is purity even mentioned in prolog?
[18:15:04] <Celelibi> What do you call purity?
[18:16:06] <pikrzysztof> I'm refering to "pure functions", i.e. ones which have no side effects = for a given input there's always the same output 
[18:17:57] <Celelibi> Side effects are pretty rare in prolog. But they exist.
[18:18:34] <pikrzysztof> side effects are as common in prolog as anywhere else, no? you can't do anything without a side effect
[18:19:04] <pikrzysztof> why bother computing something if you can't print it or send through a socket
[18:19:07] <Celelibi> I guess some implementations might cache the result of side-effect-free predicates.
[18:19:58] <Celelibi> Handling IO or ther side-effects is not wherr prolog shines.
[18:21:01] <Celelibi> other*
[18:23:17] <Celelibi> If your program is mostly IO, then maybe prolog is not the best tool.
[18:23:56] <pikrzysztof> I'm new to prolog, what project would be a good fit for it? I'm not a researcher or anything like that.
[18:28:13] <Celelibi> I hane a pretty narrow use of prolog, I might let others answer. I mostly use it when I need a Depth-First Search in a tree defined by rules. I also love clpfd, although I might remplace it with an SMT solver, like boolector.
[18:29:30] <Celelibi> But really, what I like in prolog is the non-deterministic predicates.
[18:30:33] <Celelibi> IMO prolog is of no use if the execution would be fully deterministic.

[20:23:59] <Celelibi> pikrzysztof, also, note that purity in logic means something else: https://stackoverflow.com/q/31941407/3314907
[20:26:52] <Celelibi> BTW, I guess that monads would be a nice addition to prolog to handle the side-effects in prolog. I'm not sure how practical it would be.
[20:33:18] <pikrzysztof> that definition of purity makes much more sense in prolog world

[20:50:01] <yauhsienhuangtw> I'm sorry for those bad URL.
[20:57:43] <Celelibi> The "issue" is that side effect impose a strict evaluation order. So the execution runtime doesn't have much freedom about the evaluation order.
[21:01:38] *** Joins: rgrinberg (~textual@2806:101e:7:70b6:4d9c:b9bc:cc6f:7844)
[21:12:47] <yauhsienhuangtw> yes. side-effect is really important in functional programming, that means when you have some function f: N -> N it may evaluate f(5) = 0 in the first time but f(5) = 5 in the next time, then the function f won't be like a mathematical function and you use it with ambiguity.
[21:14:44] <yauhsienhuangtw> but prolog is, rather than functional programming, "relational programming." functions and functors are just with those scopes prolog handles.
[21:18:39] <yauhsienhuangtw> for example, we say there's an arithmetical function named add: N -> N -> N, in prolog it's defined as arith(add(X,Y), Z) :- Z is X+Y. and the term "add" is a functor.
[21:21:15] <yauhsienhuangtw> when you want to build an abstraction that is about functions, you may want to build like above, using prolog predicates to build things and make them working like in functional-programming and side-effect-less way.
