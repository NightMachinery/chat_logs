[01:55:19] <stylewarning> Does anyone have any examples / engines of traditional "tile-based" (?) 8/16-bit RPGs?
[01:55:34] <stylewarning> sprite-based*
[01:57:12] <technomancy> stylewarning: maybe like https://technomancy.itch.io/tremendous-quest-iv ?
[02:01:00] <stylewarning> Cool, it looks pretty good. Any examples in Common Lisp? Or maybe even higher level, are there any primers in developing this kind of game?
[02:01:58] <technomancy> no, I don't think I've seen any CL RPG jam entries in the ones I've participated in
[02:02:03] <stylewarning> My friend's son is interested in designing and learning to program an RPG of the Zelda, old Final Fantasy, Stardew Valley type style, but he doesn't know how to program. I know how to program, but I've never designed a game.
[02:03:41] <technomancy> I've been meaning to check out https://www.solarus-games.org/en since it seems pretty capable but I don't imagine it'd be easy to integrate CL
[02:06:22] <technomancy> you might be able to find a CL library that can read the exports from https://www.mapeditor.org/ maybe? that's what I used for Tremendous Quest; it's absolutely fantastic
[02:15:26] <stylewarning> technomancy: ah, very neat!
[02:15:32] <stylewarning> these are great resources
[02:15:53] <|3b|> yeah, i think there are a few loaders for tiled maps

[22:16:53] <Pixel_Outlaw> Anyone see this? Kind of a cool idea. I do like the all in 1 flat computers. https://www.lisperaticomputers.com/
[22:28:33] <dto> hello Pixel_Outlaw 
[22:28:41] <dto> that looks fancy!
[22:29:07] <Pixel_Outlaw> I'm making my own which will be slightly more industrial but still a single body design. 
[22:29:17] <Pixel_Outlaw> Same screen though.
[22:29:22] <dto> oh cool!
[22:29:40] <dto> it'll be like when John Connor hacks an ATM with an Atari Portfolio at the beginning of Terminator 2: Judgment Day
[22:30:58] <Pixel_Outlaw> hehe
[22:31:06] <Pixel_Outlaw> I'm using this for my body: https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Hammond-Manufacturing/1456PH1WHCWW?qs=vOcB1WHNNXKKGsISQ47RUw%3D%3D
[22:31:21] <dto> it has that c64 vibe, slightly
[22:31:22] <dto> how are you? 
[22:32:08] <Pixel_Outlaw> Doing well, I've been meaning to get back to CL for a while. I do a lot of Clojure for my day job. Still feels like "some other guy's Lisp". :)
[22:32:59] <technomancy> that's why you gotta make your own lisp
[22:33:48] <Pixel_Outlaw> Hey technomancy, I didn't realize how high profile you were until I picked up Clojure. Thanks for all the hard work man. I can say your stuff is in production code at a high end security company. :)
[22:34:08] <technomancy> haha, cool. I don't do clojure in my free time any more but it's still my dayjob thing.
[22:35:01] <dto> Pixel_Outlaw: cool!
[22:35:06] <dto> hello technomancy .
[22:35:14] <technomancy> hey dto
[22:35:22] <Pixel_Outlaw> There is kind of a culture dichotomy I face. You have folks coming from Java and other algol style languages and I kind of have to hold back because stuff like closures macros are kind of spooky to them. Clojure has an "interesting" mix of cultures it brings.
[22:35:52] <technomancy> haha if you think that's bad try scala
[22:36:20] <technomancy> there's people who just want Java with more features, there's people who want it to be haskell JVM fanfic, and there's people who just want to go all in on actors
[22:36:44] <dto> im really glad i stayed away from professional programming. sounds like a pain in the punani
[22:36:58] <Pixel_Outlaw> We have a Haskell at work. He likes no documentation and single letter functions. And yet closures are spooky. Go figure.
[22:37:19] <technomancy> Pixel_Outlaw: wait ... closures?? how?
[22:38:09] <technomancy> dto: well, obviously capitalism ruins everything, but lisp dayjob stuff is better than most
[22:38:24] <dto> i bet it would be fun to work in CL that's true
[22:38:36] <dto> then i could hang with CLOS weenies :)
[22:38:51] <Pixel_Outlaw> Other members of my team just don't see the let/lambda form yet. They're relatively young in the paren world. Unfortunatly they're still stuck on lambda functions being something they mostly use in high order functions. I don't think they're to functions that return functions in their designs. It's like BASIC in parens...lol.
[22:39:48] <technomancy> Pixel_Outlaw: honestly being afraid of it could be better than going all in on point-free stuff with no restraint =)
[22:40:15] <Pixel_Outlaw> point-free?
[22:40:18] <technomancy> I had to rein in one of my co-workers who really liked long thrush chains
[22:40:30] <Pixel_Outlaw> OH SHIT, man we have so much pollution with those macros.
[22:40:54] <Pixel_Outlaw> It's all maps and arrow macros, no composition. Only map literals in those damned inflexible .edn files.
[22:41:10] <technomancy> you can tell which codebases at work people worked on when they were learning
[22:41:17] <technomancy> they're arrowed up the wazoo
[22:41:17] <Pixel_Outlaw> yeeeeeeeap
[22:41:32] <technomancy> luckily I am mostly not working in those systems these days =)
[22:41:59] <Pixel_Outlaw> Well, half of what I see is *ahem* *artistic* style indentation which is self confusing so rather than indenting forms properly they reach for those arrow macros which I guess is a bandaid to not indenting properly.
[22:42:28] <Pixel_Outlaw> Nest something 3 things deep BETTER REACH FOR AN ARROW MACRO
[22:42:35] <Pixel_Outlaw> *sigh*
[22:42:41] <technomancy> that's just part of learning tho
[22:42:46] <technomancy> takes time to develop taste and restraint
[22:43:08] <Pixel_Outlaw> Yeah, I just fear they're on a style and language learning plateau.
[22:43:20] <Pixel_Outlaw> And it'll stay that way as long as they revoke well writen pull requests.
[22:44:05] <technomancy> better overusing built-in macros than writing a bunch of their own macros
[22:46:44] <Pixel_Outlaw> They need to learn at some point, that notion between included and self defined forms needs to be broken. That stuff is vestigial from the Algol family.
[22:47:35] <technomancy> you mean the distinction between the forms that everyone who learns the language knows and the forms that no one else in the world except people who have worked on this codebase know?
[22:48:48] <Pixel_Outlaw> Sorry... I mean the notion between your code and Clojure's included code. They need to see that if you look at the source Lisp forms are defined in terms of their own forms. Which means, they too have just as much power and freedom and they're free to make things just as powerful as the included stuff. 
[22:49:38] <Pixel_Outlaw> It's not like C where the language is set in stone and you have the core language and your code which is at the mercy of the included control structures.
[22:50:43] <Pixel_Outlaw> You take Scheme for example. If you want a new control structure like for or dotimes you roll that in terms of the language itself.
[22:52:22] <Pixel_Outlaw> @dto I think if you landed a CL job there is a good chance you're be in with more Lispy people.
[22:55:44] <dto> hmm i never got many offers for that
[22:55:51] <dto> i just make puzzle games :)
[22:55:56] <Pixel_Outlaw> Probably not a lot of offers to be had....
[22:56:10] <Pixel_Outlaw> What's your latest man?
[22:56:31] <dto> i was working on a dance pad controlled game in 2021 but have not touched it this year.
[22:57:00] <dto> i'm thinking of reinventing myself as a writer
[22:57:10] <Pixel_Outlaw> Cool, was it usb interface or some strange GPIO?
[22:57:24] <dto> USB game controller dance pads
[22:57:30] <dto> i use them for Stepmania :)
[22:57:42] <dto> i'll find a vid
[22:57:59] <dto> oh hmm. i might have deleted them.
[22:58:00] <dto> oh well.
[22:58:07] <dto> what are you planning for your next effort? 
[22:58:39] <Pixel_Outlaw> I'm still trying to get a wrangle on 6502 assembly for my full sized Commodore 64 clone. Having motivation issues...
[22:59:39] *** Quits: minion (~minion@common-lisp.net) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[22:59:41] <Pixel_Outlaw> I can't quite "read" the opcodes and build a mental model.
[23:00:16] <Pixel_Outlaw> I've been in high level languages my entire programming life and it's a mental switch. :)
[23:01:02] *** Joins: minion (~minion@common-lisp.net)
[23:05:52] <dto> Pixel_Outlaw: did you see ahefner's NES lisp article about the 6502
[23:06:08] <dto> or at least i think that's the processor it was about
[23:06:13] <dto> search for ahefner nes lisp
[23:06:46] <Pixel_Outlaw> Hmmm don't think I have. I've been trying to stay with the C64 stuff on it because different machines have totally different memory locations you need to write to to have things happen.
[23:07:03] <Pixel_Outlaw> Will do though...
[23:07:06] <dto> well he does talk about how the instruction set is laid out
[23:07:14] <dto> that part might be helpful , less so the graphics parts
[23:07:32] <dto> i did some 386 assembly back in college but that's it. 
[23:08:12] <Pixel_Outlaw> Oh, this does look helpful thanks.
[23:09:12] <Pixel_Outlaw> Yeah, I did x86 using debug in dos. Our teacher never even got us to an assembler and the class was kind of poorly structured.
[23:09:26] <dto> lol debug
[23:09:30] <dto> wow
[23:09:46] <Pixel_Outlaw> It's sad man, each day we had to type in our programs and then use debug to check the results in memory. 
[23:10:10] <Pixel_Outlaw> Hell we probably should have atleast used edit.com to edit source than assemble from that.
[23:10:32] <Pixel_Outlaw> Even that's one step above raw entry each time in debug.
[23:11:15] <dto> reminds me of my dad's stories about punch cards
[23:12:56] <Pixel_Outlaw> Luckily my c64 emulator has a little console debugger where you can dump memory. I'm using Turbo Macro Pro for assembling.
[23:13:23] <dto> is that program new or old? 
[23:13:33] <Pixel_Outlaw> Oh, and also there is a "lisp" for the C64 called MicroLisp. It's just a toy but kind of amusing for a few minutes. (to bring this conversation back)
[23:13:59] <Pixel_Outlaw> Turbo Macro Pro is a tool based on an earlier tool heavily modified by the demoscene.
[23:14:06] <dto> ooo demoscene
[23:14:07] <dto> cool
[23:14:08] <Pixel_Outlaw> I wanted to run on "bare metal"
