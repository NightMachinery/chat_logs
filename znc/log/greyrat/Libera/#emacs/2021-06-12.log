[00:32:41] <mwnaylor> nij-: I read the ESR essay on hacking. In spite of myself and not liking lisp in college, I started to appreciate lisp. I spent about 1.5 years professionally developing in Scala. Scala introduced me to immutable structures and functional programming. (Scala does not reguire pure functional, but will support it.) On my Scala job, my research introduced me to Clojure. Out of the box, Clojure is immutable, functional, and a lisp. Add to
[00:32:41] <mwnaylor> that, Clojure sits upon the JVM. With interoperabilty, EVERY library written in Java is available to Clojure. Clojure has a built-in repl. The cider package in emacs ties in well w/ the Clojure repl. All these factor make Clojure ideal for ùòÆùò¶.

[02:18:35] <wasamasa> I'd rather use the well established form than ask everyone for their prefered pronouns before even talking about them
[02:18:39] <twb> A much more interesting etymology is "woman" which is from "wyf + man" ‚Äì a female human.  A male human was "were + man".

[20:44:41] <wasamasa> that's a good idea indeed
[20:44:47] <wasamasa> I've now installed espeak-ng and espeak-ng-espeak

[20:47:14] <sektor> I also have espeak-ng installed.
[20:47:45] <sektor> I figured out how to log the speech, but nothing is coming back output wise; that is to say I see what emacspeak is sending, but not what it is getting back.

[23:19:12] <johnjay> like if you create a file in the folder buried inside your AppData folder it doesn't show up in wsl
[23:19:29] <johnjay> i guess the lesson here is cygwin > wsl.
[23:19:45] <jbe> iirc from when I set up cygwin x server with wsl you had to mess around with the socket configuration to get it to work, but that may have changed as it was a long time ago
[23:20:06] <johnjay> i think it's the same. what do you mean the socket config?
[23:20:10] <johnjay> like inside cygiwn?
[23:20:14] <jbe> so hopefully whenever the wsl graphics stuff moves from insiders to actual production it'll work oob
[23:20:33] <johnjay> it should just work afaik. wsl is using tcp like everybody else
[23:20:42] <jbe> wsl at that time I think didn't support sockets so you had to swap it to tcp

[23:51:59] <huria4> Is it possible in emacs to have different sections to have a different font size?

[23:55:36] <rdrg109> huria4: Of course, that's what most people do. When I came from vim, I had the idea that having fonts in Emacs with multiple properties in a single buffer wouldn't be possible because in vim that's not possible since vim runs in terminal emulators.

[23:55:58] <Hash> You can set individal colors/fonts/sizes
[23:56:11] <huria4> Well I'm thinking of doing novel writing with emacs and will need to have the chapter title, text, and section heading as different font sizes.
[23:57:41] <kilobug> huria4: I would use some markup language, be it org-mode or markdown or something similar (or LaTeX, that's what I actually use for novel writing, but maybe not the easiest to start with)
[23:58:22] <huria4> If I used LaTeX, will I require a special package or can the stock packages be sufficient?
[23:59:03] *** samangh is now known as saman
[23:59:49] <kilobug> huria4: you'll need special packages to compile LaTeX to pdf, but not to edit it; but LaTeX while great requires some time getting used to it, org-mode or markdown are much easier and can be converted to LaTeX later on if needed
