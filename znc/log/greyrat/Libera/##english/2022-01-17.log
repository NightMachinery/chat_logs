[00:33:34] <GuiToris> I got a bag of peppermint tea a few years ago, and I realized I didn't like it :/
[00:35:00] <blkshp> Try chamomile and spearmint.
[00:38:30] <GuiToris> chamomile is very odd to drink. My mom used to put chamomile cotton wools on my eyes when ... I don't know when and why, but she did that but I still remember the smell of it, and I haven't thought of it as if it were potable

[00:40:20] <blkshp> I've never heard of it being used as a lotion.
[00:40:38] <blkshp> Spearmint is just a sweeter mint without the menthol hit really.
[00:41:01] <GuiToris> spearmint ‚Äî Noun: 1. Mentha spicata
[00:41:18] <GuiToris> sounds like a sort of menthol
[00:41:28] <GuiToris> menta - menthol, no?
[00:41:46] <blkshp> It is menthol
[00:41:54] <blkshp> Just google these things lol

[00:43:05] <blkshp> lol xD
[00:43:42] <GuiToris> as I remember chamomile is good for reducing inflammation, that's why she probably used it
[00:44:07] <blkshp> it's also a relaxant

[20:26:42] <TimMc> I like the sound of Russian.
[20:27:16] <TimMc> Mandarin sounds discordant to me, probably because I'm not used to tonal languages.
[20:30:06] <CuriosTiger> Mandarin sounds exotic to me.
[20:30:28] <CuriosTiger> but as far as pleasant languages to listen to, I think Polynesian languages come to the forefront for me.
[20:33:54] <TimMc> I *enjoy* listening to basically any foreign language, but not all of them sound *pleasant* per se.
[20:35:39] <CuriosTiger> Indeed. I find German to sound a little unpleasant, even though I speak it. And although I don't speak French, I don't understand why nasal=romantic.

[21:40:09] <rapha> hi all
[21:44:38] <rapha> i've been watching the show "The Good Doctor" about a young doctor with ASD, myself being neuronontypical and sometimes struggling to understand things that are going on around me socially, which makes this a very interesting series to watch. anyhow, there is this one episode i just watched where an african-american character discovers she's treated one of her patients who's also african-american
[21:44:40] <rapha> differently because of her race and from that experience she (the doctor) discovers she's always been someone who over-adapted in order to "make white people comfortable". could somebody who's from the US themselves explain what is meant by "making white people comfortable" here? like, always being extra calm with police officers and so on, i get that, but what does it refer to with respect to career and
[21:44:42] <rapha> workplace behaviour?
[21:45:55] <CuriosTiger> I don't think there is a simple answer to that question, rapha. BTW, I'm also a fan of that show.
[21:48:08] <CuriosTiger> but, for example, it might mean letting some comments slide if someone says something offensive/racist. It might mean adapting the way one speaks (avoiding slang/AAVE for example.) It might mean, as you state, being extra calm and subservient to white police officers. It really depends on the situation. And since I'm white myself, there's likely a lot of cultural context I'm unaware of.

[21:52:45] <CuriosTiger> If you like click languages, I recommend some of the recordings of Miriam Makeba.
[21:53:10] <rapha> hi CuriosTiger, great to know there's other fans of The Good Doctor :) ... i was sort of hoping someone here might be able to speak from their own experience. it's season 4, episode 10 by the way, and i hope i didn't spoiler anything for you!
[21:53:46] <TimMc> rapha: It can also refer to things like... a black man might have to be careful not to raise his voice, in ways that he might not have to worry about if he were white.
[21:54:33] <rapha> TimMc: okay, that definitely sounds like something that would apply to wanting to go to med school and become a doctor.
[21:54:45] <TimMc> Heh, does it?
[21:54:46] <CuriosTiger> rapha: I've relayed your question to a friend who is African-American.
[21:54:55] <spinningCat> !w feeble
[21:54:56] <tinsoldier> feeble ‚Äî Verb: 1. (obsolete) To make feeble; to enfeeble., ‚Äî Adjective: 1. Deficient in physical strength., 2. Lacking force, vigor, or effectiveness in action or expression; faint. https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/feeble
[21:54:58] <rapha> oh cool :)
[21:55:19] <TimMc> I'm not sure about med school in particular, but it is something that would generally apply to workplace social interactions.
[21:55:22] <CuriosTiger> He was on his way out the door, so it may be a while before we get a response.
[21:56:44] <rapha> TimMc: the character i referred to is a young doctor in residence. in the context of this topic she also tells a little about how it was for her to go to med school and all that as an African-American female.
[21:57:00] <rapha> CuriosTiger: i'll just hang out here for a few days.
[21:57:23] <CuriosTiger> rapha: He said he'll get back to me when he gets back home tonight.
[21:57:37] <CuriosTiger> so hopefully hours rather than days will suffice.
