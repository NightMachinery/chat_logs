[01:19:06] <nomn> Hey all! i'm back
[01:19:17] <nomn> https://jsfiddle.net/1xz9jy5e/
[01:19:52] <matsaman> and with a fiddle
[01:20:05] <nomn> it seems that the problem is specific to the "scale"
[01:20:11] <entuland> nomn, there is no scale property
[01:20:24] <entuland> you want .style.transform = "scale(4)"
[01:21:58] <nomn> oh ok. that's too bad, because i'm rescaling a lot so i lose the reference scale for a transform
[01:22:12] <nomn> (it does work in firefox interestingly enough)
[01:22:32] <nomn> thanks entuland, i'll figure out something with transform
[01:22:34] <entuland> why? you can parse the property as needed (or better, keep track of it somewhere else, dataset will be good for that
[01:24:13] <entuland> oh you are right, it's a property that only firefox supports
[01:24:24] <entuland> you'll have to work that around
[01:24:43] <entuland> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/scale (check the compatibility table at the bottom)
[01:25:26] <matsaman> omg, css is web scale =P
[01:25:28] <entuland> translate and rotate have a similar problem, only supported as direct properties by firefox
[01:25:48] <entuland> so you'll have to go with the transform for all of those if you want better compatibility
[01:28:24] <nomn> entuland: got it, i didn't realize that. what does it mean to parse the property though?
[01:29:17] <nomn> .valueOf() for example gets me the ratio (ie "scale(4)"), but not the reference (say default scale)
[01:29:32] <entuland> assuming you have control over what goes into the transform property, you could simply parse the number out of "scale(n)" - but as above, it's way better to put the datum in the dataset

[01:29:58] <entuland> el.style.transform = "scale(" + n + ")"; el.dataset.scale = n;
[01:32:02] <entuland> the default scale is 1, but if you're nesting stuff and scaling as you go, you'll have to do your own bookkeeping to get the relative scaling
[01:35:38] <nomn> thanks a lot entuland, i'll try that

[16:42:43] <dev4449> hi. good day.
[16:43:22] <dev4449> this html code works fine in the fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/m3s4kr2e/ but doesn't work fine on my browser.
[16:44:25] <dev4449> I have this html code in a file called test.html. I open it with chrome. when I go to responsive mode and make the screen less that 400px, the aside doesn't go away.
[16:44:47] <dev4449> I'd appreciate if someone tell me what is going wrong.
[16:46:54] <DPA> FlorianBad: Unfortunately, there us nothing like that. There are flex, grid, tables, position stuff and css variables for layout stuff. You'll have to make those work for you.
[16:47:23] <hassoon> dev4449: it goes away for 400px and below for me: https://ghanhass.github.io/myfiddle/370
[16:48:46] <dev4449> hassoon: Yes. It goes away in the fiddle as well. But it doesn't go away when I open the html file in my browser.
[16:50:31] <hassoon> dev4449: is that code your html file ?
[16:51:17] <dev4449> Yes. I copy pasted the code from test.html to jsfiddle. I open http://0.0.0.0:8000/test.html and there's this problem.
[16:51:42] <FlorianBad> DPA: ok, I'll just use the exact same animation then. Looks like it works that way even though I don't know if I love this approach. I also realized there was something called `expression()` years ago, but probably only for IE lol
[16:52:02] <dev4449> hassoon:Don't you think this can be due to a bug on my local machine?
[16:52:11] <dev4449> My code seems to be correct.
[16:55:17] <hunboy> FlorianBad, https://jsfiddle.net/rb4n5p0y/ note that auto value is not animtabale so you need more javascript to detect the content size of <nav>
[16:59:11] <dev4449> hassoon: I tested on firefox & chrome & opera. The problem is there on chrome & opera. But not on firefox.

[17:09:38] <dev4449> It's apparently due to a bug
[17:09:57] <hassoon> dev4449: ay check if the zoom is 100% in chrome
[17:10:04] <hassoon> dev4449: otherwise responsive css won't work
[17:10:17] <dev4449> Oh, sure
[17:11:19] <hassoon> dev4449: but hey, tell you what, the responsive simulator of chrome seems to be kind of buggy, use the manual window resiing, your code works like that
[17:11:44] <hassoon> dev4449: when you resize your window, you are already given the window dimensions
[17:12:29] <hassoon> dev4449: chrome's responsive simulator mode sucks
[17:12:37] <hassoon> chrome and opera are the same anyway
[17:13:41] <dev4449> I see. If chrome's responsive simulator is that buggy. I'll use the other two well knows browsers for studying.
[17:14:23] <dev4449> Because they're using the same engine?
[17:15:05] <hassoon> dev4449: it's alright, just resize your window manually , that's as fast as resizing the responsive simulator UI

[22:06:08] <entuland> 20 minutes of wait, may have better chances on IRC (Instant Reply Chat) :P
[22:07:18] <Rockwood_> means?
[22:07:54] <Rockwood_> what is the feedback on my design
[22:07:58] <Rockwood_> ?
[22:08:11] <entuland> it was a tongue-in-cheek remark about considering no one active after waiting just 20 minutes
[22:08:27] <entuland> you had my feedback already
[22:08:30] <undeclared> With a fixed menu, is there a way to increase the whitespace below it without messing with anything on the design?
[22:08:34] <entuland> it's pretty much the same as before
[22:08:48] <Rockwood_> yeah
[22:08:54] <entuland> undeclared, hard if not impossible to tell without seeing your context
[22:09:02] <undeclared> ok so I still manually have to do it?
[22:09:02] <Rockwood_> smaller changes i have done
[22:09:04] <undeclared> https://www.metadock.org
[22:09:07] <undeclared> that's my WIP
[22:09:22] <undeclared> but my mobile menu is broken
[22:09:25] <entuland> define "whitespace below it"
[22:09:32] <undeclared> go mobile, then click the hamburger
[22:09:38] <undeclared> it opens the menu, but it doesn't use the space
[22:09:49] <undeclared> you might have to lower the width substantially for the hamburger to pop up
[22:10:02] <entuland> seems like you're using a width-dependent whitespace on the vertical spacing
[22:10:06] <entuland> that seems definitely wrong
[22:10:16] <undeclared> I'm usually a backend dev, this is what I put together lol
[22:10:29] <entuland> open it on a desktop browser and narrow the window down gradually to see the behavior
[22:10:31] <undeclared> I'm sure I'm doing 20 things wrong
[22:10:39] <undeclared> on the vertical spacing where?
[22:10:41] <entuland> well, you can learn
[22:11:02] <undeclared> yep happy to
[22:11:15] <entuland> https://i.imgur.com/QR5g4wK.png
[22:11:18] <undeclared> ah
[22:11:31] <undeclared> I put that whole section margin: auto I think
[22:11:44] <undeclared> and on mobile it adds 20% yeah
[22:11:50] <entuland> https://i.imgur.com/3bGW38J.png
[22:11:52] <undeclared> but this was because the menu is there and it doesn't take up space
[22:12:00] <undeclared> so get rid of that margin then?
[22:12:04] <Rockwood_> Json will be manage generate by backend and frontend will be display that json stuffs
[22:12:21] <entuland> you could avoid having to mess with that approach altogether
[22:12:28] <undeclared> how so?
[22:13:21] <entuland> make the main container of the page a flex layout, put the menu in the first spot, put all the rest of your page in a second container beneath the menu, and have this container overflow-y: auto to get the vertical scrolling
[22:13:32] <entuland> that is, only scroll the content container, don't scroll the entire page
[22:13:34] <undeclared> oh I see
[22:13:43] <entuland> the content container will adapt to whatever size the menu will have
[22:13:53] <undeclared> got it
[22:13:57] <undeclared> I'm gonna try it and get back to you, thanks

[22:14:55] <entuland> Rockwood_, I've provided you feedback already, what you're sharing doesn't show a precise end goal and it's just little more than a stub from the UI point-of-view

[22:16:54] <entuland> you're not at the point about deciding the UI
[22:17:38] <Rockwood_> https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/h237TqxHkt/ i accepted your way

[22:25:48] <Rockwood_> just now one more thing is remain
[22:26:34] <entuland> okay, so you should rename "Field three" in "Routine one" or "Name of the routine", Equipped should contain a list of tools or abilities or something, and you should give it a name, field five should probably be "Amount of repetitions" or so
[22:26:57] <Rockwood_> yes that is

[22:30:16] <entuland> yep, you can use a grid layout as well
[22:30:17] <undeclared> yeah css grid is magic though
[22:30:21] <undeclared> I should use that instead of flex
[22:30:38] <entuland> flex is totally okay for just doing that trick with the menu at the top
[22:30:54] <undeclared> static menu and static footer wouldn't be too bad
[22:31:08] <entuland> you can do that as well with flex

[23:18:02] <lmat> I have two divs with a common parent. Sometimes div1 shows, sometimes div2 should show depending on the user hitting a button. I would like for div1 to dictate the height of div2.
[23:18:35] <lmat> So whatever div1's height is just through natural layout, how do I make div2's height match?
[23:18:52] <lmat> Sorry if I'm being unclear!
[23:19:26] <lmat> div1 is a form with several inputs and div2 is a list of items. Div2 can reasonably be nearly any height, but I would like it to be div1's height.
[23:23:48] <undeclared> flex could keep them the same size in theory
[23:23:56] <undeclared> I'm not sure if it fits your setup
[23:24:08] <undeclared> you'd need a div above div1 and div2 with display: flex, and lets say flex: 1 on both
[23:24:18] <undeclared> assuming its in the same area
[23:24:40] <undeclared> let me rephrase, that was a bit unclear
[23:25:36] <undeclared> example: https://pastebin.com/VTXsxpBp
[23:26:45] <lmat> https://jsfiddle.net/d039Lkmf/ Doesn't look like that works...
[23:27:06] <lmat> Sorry, I'm sure I wasn't clear. I need only one visible at a time!
[23:27:26] <lmat> I have been `display: none;` on one of them, but I would be equally happy with making them overlap and using z order or something.
[23:27:43] <undeclared> with flex you can have 2 elements that are equally sized automatically
[23:27:53] <undeclared> so for example, you put flex: 0 if not visible
[23:27:55] <undeclared> press button, flex: 1
[23:28:07] <undeclared> let me try your fiddle
[23:28:17] <undeclared> only one at once.. hm
[23:28:32] <undeclared> obviously the javascript route is the easiest.. but I'm sure there's a css way
[23:28:41] <lmat> wow, cool.
[23:29:42] <lmat> Oh, flex: 0; flex: 1; didn't seem to make them invisible or visible...I think I'm misunderstanding what flex: 1 is supposed to do.
[23:29:49] <undeclared> no thats my bad
[23:30:13] <undeclared> I just told you that.. I had that impression from some code I wrote, but I just looked at it to give you it, and it doesn't work that way
[23:30:48] <undeclared> anyhow you could just do display: none; and display: visible though
[23:32:10] <lmat> undeclared: With display:none; the div disappears and stops taking up space...
[23:32:24] <undeclared> overflow: visible, I think
[23:32:29] <undeclared> sec

[23:33:47] <entuland> if it's done via CSS, it's better to use display: revert - if it's done via inline styling, it's better to just remove the display rule altogether
[23:34:02] <undeclared> https://jsfiddle.net/z87dLqu4/2/
[23:34:12] <undeclared> ah didn't see /1/
[23:34:23] <undeclared> id say more like that ^ and just make it invisible
[23:34:35] <undeclared> but entuland can probably answer your question 100x better than I
[23:34:55] <entuland> it's not clear to me which are the conditions to have it shown or hidden
[23:35:02] <lmat> entuland: Sure, I'll start over...
[23:35:23] <entuland> I just need the condition
[23:36:10] <entuland> makes a big difference if it's something simple as a specific size or a mouse hover vs some JS condition
[23:36:11] <lmat> https://jsfiddle.net/d039Lkmf/1/ but I need div2 to get (or "inherit") div1's height. Making the divs visible and invisible is done with javascript.
[23:36:45] <entuland> have the initial CSS show the one you want to keep and hide the other with display: none;
[23:37:04] <entuland> use JS to swap the two around by setting display: none; on one and by using display: revert; on the other
[23:37:13] <entuland> alternatively, do that via classes
[23:37:33] <entuland> just a single class on the parent would do
[23:39:46] <entuland> just replace :hover with that class and have JS toggle that class: https://jsfiddle.net/entuland/dj2u94L6/
[23:39:55] <lmat> entuland: Thank you. That is what I Have now. The problem is that div2 is smaller than div1 because it doesn't have as much in it.
[23:40:13] <entuland> set it to grow

[23:44:28] <entuland> when you have something affected by flex or grid, at most you should do relative placement (in case it's needed to create a new context for their chidlren)
[23:44:41] <entuland> you don't need to have them go on top of each other if you only show one at a time
[23:44:50] <lmat> entuland: That's right!
[23:45:24] <lmat> That last link you gave is great, but how do I make sure div2 is the same size as div1?
[23:45:32] <hassoon> lmat: did you share a fiddle of your form ?
[23:45:46] <entuland> lmat, just give them an equal min height or something
[23:46:33] <lmat> hassoon: no.
[23:46:39] <entuland> something has to take precedence in the definition of how much room is taken, there are countless ways to achieve that and it really depends on the contex
[23:46:50] <hassoon> entuland: was wondering, didn't he state he has a form with a child div that is supposed to stretch to the form's height, which is the said parent ?
[23:46:52] <DPA> https://jsfiddle.net/n9pmyrad/4/
[23:47:14] <entuland> dunno, hassoon, I've missed most of the convo before when I chipped in
[23:47:50] <hassoon> lmat: just share a fiddle for your exact use case, and tell us the issue
[23:48:45] <lmat> entuland: I was hoping that whatever div1 height becomes just from natural layout, div2 could get that height. So, I don't want to look at div1 and hard-code its size, then copy that to div2. That's super easy and all, but it's brittle and will break if the font size is different on a user's machine, or when I add something to div1, etc.
[23:49:44] <DPA> lmat: Try my fiddle.
[23:49:53] <hassoon> lmat: div1 is given whatever height, div2 which is a child of div1, should get the height of div1, if you give it height:100%
[23:49:57] <hassoon> it's as simple as that
[23:50:30] <hassoon> lmat: i don't undertstand whatt's pussling here
[23:50:44] <hassoon> * puzzling *
[23:51:32] <lmat> DPA: On first glance, that looks perfect.
[23:51:56] <lmat> hassoon: div1 has lots of other things in it, not just div2 :-)
[23:52:42] <hassoon> lmat: then if div2 is supposed to take the height of div1, and div1 has alot other children, which are siblings to your div2, how do you think it's possible ?
[23:52:57] <hassoon> lmat: just show us a fiddle with your original code
[23:53:59] <lmat> hassoon: div1 is a sibling to div2. They share a parent.
[23:54:54] <hassoon> ah you want only those 2 elements to have the same height whatsoever ? or you want them both to have the same height as the parent's whatsoever ?
[23:56:21] <lmat> hassoon: Div2 should get the same height as div1. div1 gets its height "naturally". The parent only contains div1 and div2. The parent is not important except that I assume it's necessary to pull this off.
[23:57:47] <entuland> lmat, if you want to achieve that, you need to have div1 impose its sizes to the container, and have div2 "grow" to the available space - the swap between the two can then be done by overlaying 2 on 1 and hiding 2 when you want to display 1
[23:58:06] <entuland> you shouldn't use flex for that at all
