[00:11:41] <[itchyjunk]> i want to show lim z->0 (bar(z)/z)^2 DNE.
[00:12:40] <[itchyjunk]> i did lim z->0 (x^2-y^2-2ixy)/(x^2+y^2+2ixy) , let z = x+iy then let delta y -> 0 so lim y-> 0 -y^2/y^2 = 1
[00:12:41] <somiaj> Just use polar form
[00:12:53] <[itchyjunk]> and lim deltax -> 0 = +1
[00:13:03] <[itchyjunk]> oh polar form. but does this work?
[00:13:17] <[itchyjunk]> i approach from x and y axis respectively and get different constants do DNE
[00:13:58] <somiaj> z = re^(it), bar(z) = re^(-it), so bar(z)/z = e^(-2it), and square it to get e^(-4it)
[00:14:04] <somiaj> Yea your method works too
[00:14:04] <loller_> I have the following problem: Consider a holomorphic function f : C -> C with f(z) = f(z+1) = f(z+i) for all C. Show that f is constant.
[00:14:20] <somiaj> But from there you can see the limit as r->0 depends on the value of t, and is not unique
[00:14:31] <loller_> now by the Liouville theorem, since f is an entire function by assumption, it is enough to show that f is also a bounded function

[00:18:19] <johnkeats6> it's bounded there due to continuity
[00:18:55] <loller_> johnkeats6: right, it's continuous (since it's holomorphic) on a compact region
[00:19:09] <loller_> so I don't even need to involve the maximum modulus principle, right? (assuming that it would even work)
[00:20:31] <[itchyjunk]> hmm whats lim t-> ? if z -> 0 i have to change of variable that to t ?
[00:21:04] <somiaj> [itchyjunk]: in polar form lim z->0 is the same as r->0 and t can be any value
[00:21:27] <[itchyjunk]> ah
[00:21:29] <somiaj> basically from t=0 to t=2pi you get all 'rays' going to zero, but you can also have t vary (instead of stay constant) as your approach zero
[00:21:36] <johnkeats6> loller_, nope just liouvilles thm

[01:06:09] <sek> mouseghost: if you want to think of it in a fancy way, you could say that the operations are all "over Z", in the sense that after taking some finite extension of Z (where you add the coefficients of your elliptic curve), then all the algebra required for addition of points is happening over that ring, so you specialise to the generic point (ie to the elliptic curve in char 0), or to any of the special points

[02:08:11] <loller_> and -(1/k)^2 has k=0 as a limit point? unless I am completely lost here
[02:08:12] <somiaj> anyways, that attempt seems useful, but since this has to hold for all k in Z^+, a_n cannot depend on k.

[02:13:53] <PlanckWalk> Technically, just about some disk centered on 0
[02:14:04] <loller_> however, when I try to find the coefficients that a_n would correspond to (as I've done in the mathb.in) I get that strange expression for a_n
[02:14:18] <loller_> namely one where a_n contains 1/k^n as a factor
[02:14:29] <PlanckWalk> k is irrelevant
[02:14:42] <PlanckWalk> k just counted through the points of the set where they agree
[02:15:07] <loller_> but I would then not be able to calculate a_2021 and a_2021, correct? since these would depend on k
[02:15:17] <PlanckWalk> Once you apply the identity theorem, you get that the equality must hold for all z in some disk about zero.
[02:15:30] <loller_> ohh
[02:15:51] <loller_> and then I can choose a particular value for k, right? and the coefficients a_n must apply to that case?

[07:36:39] <nagefire> I can't justify AD bisecting angle A though, I don't remember theorems of regular polygons too well
[07:37:26] <nagefire> In fact, I'm pretty sure that PAE is 1/3 of A and PAB is 2/3 due to properties of regular polygons
[07:37:58] <nagefire> Since we can divide the pentagon into congruent triangles AED, DAB, and DCB
[07:39:11] <nagefire> DAE is the same angle as PAE, which is one of the congruent angles of the 36-36-108 isocelese triangle DAE
[07:39:25] <biberao> i dont know about 1/3 or 2/3
[07:39:27] <biberao> so
[07:41:01] <nagefire> Just realized that triangles DAE and DCB are congruent to eachother but not DAB
[07:41:42] <nagefire> solving for angle DAB will allow us to completely determine the triangle PAB
[07:42:44] *** Quits: cjb (~cjb@user/cjb) (Quit: rcirc on GNU Emacs 29.0.50)
[07:43:15] <nagefire> I just realized that PAB is isoceles, PB and PA are similar sides
[07:43:34] <nagefire> It is a 72-72-36 triangle
[07:44:41] *** Joins: egy (egy@tilde.team)
[07:45:37] <nagefire> So, by properties of transversal lines, DPB=DCB=108 and EPA=108
[07:46:32] <nagefire> EPD = APB, giving 360 = 2*EPD + 108*2 and EPD = 72
[07:47:24] <nagefire> Congruence of APB and PAB gives, APB=PAB=72 and PBA = 190-2(72) = 36
[07:48:06] <isekaijin> Do the usual categories of spaces (e.g., of smooth manifolds, of algebraic varieties, etc.) themselves come equipped with anything resembling a topology?
[07:50:29] <isekaijin> In particular, I would like a “semi-rigorous” justification for only caring about quasi-projective varieties in algebraic geometry.
[07:51:00] <isekaijin> In some sense, you have to “go out of your way” to construct non-quasi-projective varieties.

[08:17:00] <nagefire> If I thought about it for a while I could probably come up with something

[08:17:35] <biberao> when to use the internal angle
[08:17:38] <biberao> i guess
[08:17:45] <biberao> since its not saying bisector

[08:19:39] <nagefire> By internal angle, you mean 180*(n-2)/n?
[08:20:20] *** Joins: i0e (~is0ke3@user/is0ke3)
[08:21:20] <biberao> yes
[08:21:52] <nagefire> You only use 180*(n-2)/n when you want to find the value of an angle of a regular n-gon
[08:22:07] <nagefire> For an irregular n-gon, the sum of the angles still equals 180*(n-2)
[08:22:14] <nagefire> But because you can'
[08:22:46] <nagefire> t assume equality of angles, there is way to derive all the angles from the sum without knowing more about your polygon
[08:24:08] <nagefire> I believe that you use 360/n when looking at the angles from the center of your polygon to each vertex (for an n-regular polygon)
[08:24:54] <biberao> lots to learn
[08:26:04] <nagefire> It may help to learn about symmetries of polygons with group theory

[14:01:32] <nagefire> lok91 you took the gradient wrong
[14:01:38] <lok91> nagefire How so?
[14:01:48] <nagefire> the first coordinate should be yz + 2xz^2
[14:02:05] <nagefire> you forgot to include the partial derivative of x^2 z^2 w.r.t. x
[14:02:57] <nagefire> The final coordinate should be xy + 2zx^2, so Psi is indeed a potential of the vector field
[14:02:57] <lok91> Oh, sorry, stupid mistake!
[14:03:51] <lok91> Let's see... then the gradient must be (z(2xz + y), xz + 2, x(2xz + y))

[14:11:33] <nagefire> With my parameterization, the integrand is -1
[14:11:44] <nagefire> Over the interval [0, 1], the result is -1
[14:11:56] <lok91> Hm, maybe it depends on the parameterization chosen? So it does not have a unique answer?
[14:12:07] <lericson> it does
[14:12:15] <nagefire> I used the parameterization σ(t) = [t, 0, 1-t] for t in [0,1]
[14:12:30] <nagefire> lericson If you do line integrals correctly it's invariant of parameterization
[14:12:53] <lericson> nagefire: that's what i'm saying so i guess you meant to tell lok91 ;)
[14:13:05] <lok91> Oh. Well...
[14:13:17] <lericson> i mean if you think about it, it has to be the case
[14:13:22] <lok91> Then I suppose that at least two of us made a mistake. If we obtain three different answers.
[14:13:46] <nagefire> I think that d3x0r didn't account for the vector field
[14:13:53] <nagefire> He was just looking at the arclength of the line segment
[14:13:59] <d3x0r> I didn't - mine's just a shot in the dark mostly :)
[14:14:06] <lok91> :P
[14:14:20] <lok91> So the answer is -1? Hm...
[14:15:19] <nagefire> I checked my arithmetic with sympy, looks like it's right, assuming that my parameterization is correct
[14:15:38] <lericson> now do it numerically
[14:15:47] <lok91> Then I must have misunderstood something :P
[14:15:55] <lok91> lericson Can line integrals be done numerically?
[14:16:00] <nagefire> I don't know a way to do it numerically unless the it's over a volume integral
[14:16:00] <lericson> sure why not
[14:16:11] <nagefire> Which would still assume that I have the correct parameterization
[14:16:21] <lok91> They're quite complicated - I cannot even type it into WolframAlpha :p
[14:16:24] <d3x0r> the first is (1,0,0) so wouldn't it be (1-t,0,t) ?  and maybe negative?

[14:17:06] <lericson> you win math
[14:18:04] <nagefire> d3x0r I just realized that we're both correct
[14:18:18] <lericson> now that i think about it, how do you even compute a line integral
[14:18:22] <nagefire> My curve is just using the reverse orientation
[14:18:47] <nagefire> No orientation is given in the problem, so we should assume that the integral is unsigned, hence the correct answer is 1
[14:19:05] <lok91> Hm, how can you both be correct?
[14:19:41] <nagefire> If sigma_1(t) = sigma_2(-t), the line integral over sigma_1 and sigma_2 have different signs
[14:19:58] <lok91> Shouldn't the problem specify the orientation?
[14:20:04] <lok91> If the answer depends on the orientation?
[14:20:20] <d3x0r> it does you have a start and end
[14:20:22] <nagefire> sorry, I meant sigma_1(t) = sigma_2(T - t), where T is the end of the interval
[14:20:40] <nagefire> lok91 if no orientation is given its assumed that you integrate over an unoriented curve
[14:21:37] <nagefire> So the derivative of the path is positive
[14:21:47] <nagefire> Your result can still be negative if your vector field satisfies certain properties
[14:22:11] <nagefire> But in this case the vector field maps each vector in R^3 to a vector with positive components
[14:22:55] <lok91> Makes sense
[14:23:34] <lok91> So here we integrate over an unoriented curve? And if we integrated over an oriented curve, the result would differ?
[14:23:50] <nagefire> Yes, if you use my orientation the result is negative
[14:23:59] <nagefire> And if you use the other orientation the result is positive
[14:24:18] <nagefire> It looks like your professor didn't think too hard about the consequences of not specifying an orientation
[14:24:24] <lok91> Oh, that's why
[14:24:27] <nagefire> They expected everyone to parameterize the curve the same way

[15:04:59] <lok91> Well, but if 4te^(2t) + t is indeed a correct answer, then the Laplace transform of that should give F(s), right?

[16:26:02] <Z-module> biberao: do you know that if X is any point on a circle, and you draw any two lines from X over to two points on the circle, the agngle those lines form at X is half of the radian measure of the intercept arc?
[16:26:56] <biberao> yes
[16:27:16] <Z-module> so that gets us the angle at B between those dotted lines
[16:27:59] <biberao> which is?
[16:28:14] <Z-module> pi/6
[16:28:52] <Z-module> because each arc between consecutive vertices of this regular hexagon has radian measure (2pi)/6 = pi/3, and half of that is pi/6
[16:29:07] <biberao> so B is "seen" by arc ED right?
[16:29:14] <Z-module> yes
[16:29:25] <biberao> ok
[16:29:54] <biberao> so what about
[16:29:56] <biberao> SBC?
[16:30:00] <Z-module> the next thing you need is that those two dotted lines at R meet at right angles. I'd have to think more on how to show that.
[16:30:35] <biberao> ok please
[16:30:58] <biberao> can we call
[16:30:59] <Z-module> angle SBC is also pi/6 -- the arc subtended by the endpoints up there is also pi/3 for the same reason as before

[16:33:11] *** Joins: [itchyjunk] (~itchyjunk@user/itchyjunk/x-7353470)
[16:33:37] <Z-module> well that's *also* pi/6 radians (they all are, between consecutive vertices of the hexagon), but you asked about angle SBC. That means the angle at the point B, between the dotted line and the solid line.
[16:33:54] <Z-module> and the arc subtended by those two lines is CD
[16:34:31] <biberao> so
[16:34:35] <biberao> that works the same?
[16:34:50] <biberao> so any angle faced to an arc will work?
[16:35:04] <Z-module> if the vertex is *on* the circle itself, yes
[16:35:05] <biberao> so lets say
[16:35:13] <biberao> SCB
[16:35:17] <biberao> its arc AB
[16:35:31] <Z-module> yes, SCB and SBC are both pi/6

[17:01:37] <sek> maybe you could get a satisfactory answer in some category of motives: Chow's lemma would tell you that everything is equivalent to a quasi-projective variety in this category

[17:03:03] <sek> well there's motives and motives. On a very elementary level you can just consider the category of varieties over some field k and then quotient by the relation [X]~[U]+[Z] if U=X\Z is open or something like that
[17:04:21] <sek> motives are really meant to formalise something else, so in your question this seems like it's introducing something new and then arguing that that new thing is interesting...
[17:05:09] <isekaijin> What are motives meant to formalize?
[17:05:29] <sek> properties of cohomology theories
[17:06:50] <sek> you have these weil cohomology theories attaching to a scheme X/k a group H^i_bla(X), and these groups satisfy excision, kunneth, .... Then you want to say that these operations X |-> H^i_bla should basically factor through some category of motives, which is a much more finite thing than the category of varieties
[17:07:00] <isekaijin> Oooh, that actually seems more useful. So motives are like “more abstract things for which taking their cohomology still makes sense”?
[17:07:03] <sek> I'm not expert. I'm sure wikipedia has better motivation

[17:37:35] <greenbagels> Surely the introduction to trig that these precalculus textbooks use (just defining trig functions using sohcahtoa and no geometric motivation) is not the right move
[17:37:52] <dude12312414> you could start with 30-60-90 and 45-45-90 triangles, they give some special values for trig functions

[17:39:51] <mycroftiv> i think you are supposed to draw triangles inside circles and show how altering the geometry of the triangle by sliding a vertex along the perimeter changes angles and ratios and relates to pi
[17:40:13] <greenbagels> That's what I was thinking, but I think you have to build up to it or you'll lose people
[17:40:38] <greenbagels> Like before that you have to convince them that fixing the hypotenuse length is a natural concept
[17:41:01] <greenbagels> ie every right triangle is similar to one with a given hypotenuse length
[17:41:15] <callq> How can I compare similarity/accuracy between two sets of data of (which may be unequal size).   I have data that is like [2, 10, 20], then results that are like [1, 11, 18, 19]. So that second set should get a high "score" based on how many values it has which are close to the first. another set of data such as [5,6,7] would score lower. Any ideas?

[21:56:57] <isekaijin> That is the point.

[22:01:16] <isekaijin> And let g : R^2 -> R be the map g(x,y) = y.

[23:46:20] <tom__> thanks
[23:47:00] <tom__> Ok that is surprising
[23:47:49] <tom__> :)

[23:58:26] <tom__> To find a proper subset of X which is connected would it be sufficiently rigorous argue to pick {a} and argue that ({a},{emptyset, a}) is {a} equipped wih the trivial topology and is therefore connected
