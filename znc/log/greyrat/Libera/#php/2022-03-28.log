[18:04:22] <AllenJB> There's approx 4 billion public IPv4 addresses. At 100 per second, it would take you over a year to scan them all. Scanning all of them is not a sensible proposition. (Plus I think that you're likely to get put on some blacklists for attempting to do so)

[19:56:17] <hans> __adrian: not arguing with that. it's extremely rare that i'd even want multithreading when doing php
[19:57:59] <hans> that php-fpm/mod_php thing where each request is handled by a different os-level thread though, that works beautifully

[19:58:48] <stenno> not relevant for cli

[20:01:24] <__adrian> it's not "neglected"
[20:01:59] <stenno> well yeah its a conscious decision

[20:02:20] <__adrian> dynamic typing was not a compromise or mistake.
[20:02:56] <__adrian> and like dynamic typing, single-threaded applications _do_ have advantages

[20:04:26] <hans> stenno "i wonder what is the best programming language for this absurd task" - Golang has a very interesting threading system, where Go just creates actual os-level threads equal to the number of cpus and then handle each userland-level-thread (goroutine? go-thread?) in those 4 os-level threads, and it can easily run 100,000+ userland threads, wouldn't surprise me if golang would be a good language to do it in actually
[20:05:40] <hans> (i played around with golang and an absurd amount of threads, and golang could handle way more threads than c++, to my surprise. the threads actually worked too, they didn't just hang/exist-on-paper)

[20:13:20] <hans> .. which is cool because you can write sequential blocking code in userland, and golang execute them async, when 1 thread does something that blocks, it jumps to another thread, in theory (and in practice :o ) much faster than your os-level thread scheduler can
[20:13:57] <__adrian> stenno: i don't have a deep understanding of the implementation, but it's "real threading" as far as i understand it

[20:34:07] <AllenJB> Those images are "official" to the Docker project, not the PHP project.
[20:34:16] <__adrian> ^
[20:34:19] <stenno> maybe the tag called 'latest'
[20:34:20] <zumba_addict> got it
[20:35:03] <AllenJB> The PHP project does not release an LTS version. You can find the support timeline for releases at: https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php (linked from the downloads page)
[20:38:35] <hans> (PHP5.6 was notable for getting.. what was it, an extra year of support?)

[21:02:35] <Naktibalda> __adrian: really? PHP 6 was dead before release of 5.4
[21:03:28] <Naktibalda> I think that even some of 5.3 features, like namespaces were originally meant for php 6
[21:03:38] <__adrian> 5.4
[21:03:46] <__adrian> but you'r right, i was thinking of the wrong thing
[21:04:10] <__adrian> 5.6 was because no one was migrating off et/mysql
[21:04:48] <__adrian> crap my  key broken
[21:05:35] <__adrian> i'v noticed nn has been double-pressing lately but i thought i was just hitting it wrong. sheesh
