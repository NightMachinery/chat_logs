[00:02:46] <vdamewood> I'm thinking maybe I could use libsigc++ as a place holder until I can get another license.
[00:03:13] <Jigsy> I have a quick question.
[00:03:33] <vdamewood> I have a quick answer.
[00:03:53] <Jigsy> I've been scripting an IRCd in mIRC lately. Anyway, long story short, which is better? Nested if statements or returning after each one?
[00:04:27] <vdamewood> Are you checking for fail conditions? return after each one.
[00:04:36] <Jigsy> Yes.
[00:05:00] <vdamewood> if (oops) { return I_FAILED ] if (crap) { return I_MESSED_UP } ... and so on.

[02:23:58] <mrig> ayenet4: for unicode char?
[02:24:03] <ayenet4> if it's a range in the table, thats fine
[02:24:13] <mrig> the ascii it's simple math :)
[02:24:34] *** Joins: justinf210 (~justinf21@192-230-160-245.3rivers.net)
[02:24:45] <vdamewood> ayenet4: Yeah, for that they'd have to have all the upper case characters together, and they decided to have all the characters in a certain script together instead.
[02:25:29] <vdamewood> They also wanted to have a certain level of backwards compatability to ASCII, so they couldn't just stick the Cyrillic and Greek letters into the lower 127 codepoints.
[02:26:44] <vdamewood> It's all a matter of tradeoffs and they traded this off.

[02:33:24] <ayenet4> random thought popped into my head,"how does utbf8 do this"
[02:33:31] <vdamewood> ayenet4: Do you know what the capital of i is?
[02:33:46] <mrig> they are not very regexp friendly, or for sorting efficiently.
[02:34:27] <ayenet4> yeah ascii is just a quick bit flip

I have transplanted it into a different codebase which is able to produce the requirment for it to operate on and had planned to test it within that other code that it was transplanted into. The prolem is the code it is transplanted into is not the real code. Is
[10:25:43] <blahboybaz> there some possibility it would pass in the surrogate code (where it is transplaned into) but not in the original code (the real codebase)? If so then the approach is a bad approach and I also would not know what else to do. Ultimately I am trying to test with jest.

[10:27:23] <Arahael> That's the key thing - always in isolation.
[10:27:25] <blahboybaz> unit testing is what I want to start with on that method I'm talking about
[10:28:08] <Arahael> Yeah.  So with unit testing, you want to ensure that the unit under test is behaving correctly, given all the requirements.

[10:28:42] <blahboybaz> The method I want to unit test has a dependency and is a dependency (at the same time). It is a utility method used by the other methods in the class but the other methods in the class are the ones that create what that utility method operated upon
[10:28:52] <Arahael> However, unit testing often does not test the interactions *between* units in the entire system - if you did that, the unit tests would become fragile because a change in one unit would break tests in (potentially many) other units.
[10:29:20] <Arahael> blahboybaz: So you need to determine the interactions that that unit are required to support, and test that those interactions perform correctly.
[10:30:25] <blahboybaz> yes, its in constructing the test that I'm stumbling

[10:31:23] <Arahael> And to answer your question: Yes, there is possibility that it would pass in code that exposes interactions you were not expecting, and it can be difficult to ensure that you cover all possible interactions without (sometimes significantly) refactoring the code base.  Unfortunately, you want to leave that refactoring to *after* you've done the tests so a bit of a catch-22.

[10:34:16] <blahboybaz> I'm not really sure what that sort of testing is
[10:34:44] <Arahael> blahboybaz: Imagine you hire someone to do testing of the system, they haven't written the code, nor are they a developer who would understand the code.  The sort of testing they'd do is "system testing".
[10:34:46] <blahboybaz> The point is to learn unit testing and jest (in particular) and the disciplines of tdd
[10:34:58] <kodah> e2e testing?
[10:35:09] <blahboybaz> e2e I understand
[10:35:19] <Arahael> blahboybaz: With TDD, you want to write the tests *before* you have this code, so if you're practicing TDD, then this would be regarded as legacy code.

[10:37:14] <blahboybaz> So it sound like system testing (even if automated) is like its coming from the standpoint of a user? It's basically just testing the system as a whole (testing functionality)?

[10:37:44] <kodah> blahboybaz: TDD ends up implying some architectural considerations (ie: size and scope of functions). you might be able to refactor some of your existing codebase to satisfy that requirement, but without existing testing you won't know if you've broken something, so then you have to play this game of widdling down sections of the codebase you don't know. thus, it's not really ideal to do in

[10:55:41] <Arahael> You need to identify all the permutations of the inputs, eg, "what if an index is 0? -1? 1? 2?", etc, and write a test that ensures that each input that covers a unique pathway in the code is covered.
[10:56:34] <Arahael> Eg, you probably don't need to write tests for index 2 as well as index 3, if the exact same code path will produce the value, but you do want to test all the "boundary conditions", so for this, that'd be where index is -1, 0, 1, and the maximum index, one before the max, and one after the max.

[10:57:43] <blahboybaz> I cut my teeth on C
[10:58:02] <Arahael> sandman13: Why do you find it harder with C?
[10:58:08] <sandman13> especially if it's in the following manner: foo() { bar(); }
[10:58:36] <sandman13> Arahael: Lack of experience with testing and the language itself
[10:58:40] <blahboybaz> Arahael: I see, so the condition where the index is outside the list (before or after it), the condition where index is 0 (retrieve head) and the condtion after index 0 (the second node).
[10:59:17] <Arahael> blahboybaz: Right.  And also probably what happens if the head is null when it shouldn't be, and what if head is fine, but head.next is null.
[10:59:49] <sandman13> Arahael: also the system (legacy) I am dealing with is tightly coupled. Way beyond my experience (lol, no C projects written by me).
[10:59:58] <blahboybaz> Whether or not the head is null when it shouldn't be is the createNode() responsibility I thought
[10:59:59] <Arahael> blahboybaz: I would probably personally define the "Unit' here to be the List, so that I don't need to be quite so defensive there - List should be tested so that the head is always sett up correctly.
[11:00:20] <blahboybaz> getByIndex() just returns nodes or an empty list if it is empty
[11:00:25] <Arahael> sandman13: Yeah, C projects rarely have dependency injection, but it's possible to test each C file individually.
[11:00:38] <Arahael> sandman13: (And use the linker to inject the dependencies, effectively)
[11:01:15] <sandman13> Arahael: I have been using cmocka for that. But the question is always in the back of my head? "Am I doing it correctly?"
[11:01:17] <blahboybaz> Arahael: You mean test in the original codbase?
[11:01:28] <Arahael> blahboybaz: Right, but consider what happens if head represents a linked list of only 3 elements, yet this.size reports 5.
[11:02:04] <blahboybaz> You would hit null before the supposed end of the list (throws an error from the interpreter)
[11:02:16] <blahboybaz> Can't gett next of null
[11:02:17] <Arahael> blahboybaz: I mean in your unit test, but testing that one method in isolation is fine, just means you have to be more detailed since the rest of the class is 'outside' the unit, and classes usually have tight coupling.
[11:03:23] <Arahael> blahboybaz: Right!  So, test that case too!  Test what happens if you hit null before the end.  If you were testing the List as the unit, you could look at ways where it might be possible to achieve that - and if you can achieve that, then you'd have to fail the test.
[11:03:43] <blahboybaz> Well getByIndex() is designed to handle out of bounds case so if it works right it should return -1 which can be used by it's caller to act appropriately.
[11:03:57] <Arahael> blahboybaz: Good, so test that too, then.
[11:04:05] <blahboybaz> :)
[11:04:11] <blahboybaz> for sure

I want to make a table tracking a many-many relationship between a property and the objects it applies to, but there is more than one type of object stored in more than one type of table. is it a good idea to make a table that tracks the property ID, the value ID, and some indicator of which table the value ID can be found in? or is there a better way of doing that?

[11:27:33] <recursiveNode> when you're coding a small project of some sort, but with a novel, original architecture that must have a real-world impact on the industry, what are you doing to your code to ensure you're adding something new, original, significant for the industry?

[11:32:02] <ross> recursiveNode: all programming projects necessarily do something new unless they're just duplicating another project's work, but that's not what the project intends to do from the outset. starting a programming project with only the intent to do something that hasn't been done before won't get you anywhere, but start a project with the intent to do *something* and you'll likely end up doing something new at some point
[11:32:33] <ross> I would say the only way to intentionally do something new is to make a project whose purpose is to fix some unsolved or ignored problem
[11:33:38] <recursiveNode> ross so, you suggest to become aware of new, unaddressed requirements, and to invent new functions that address them?

[11:37:38] <ross> what's the context of your question?
[11:39:28] <recursiveNode> ross the context is a distributed publish/subscribe system that does pattern matching on messages to filter only messages of interest. A user defines patterns he wants, i.e. message{name="John", age > 18, occupation="developer") followed within 3s by a message(name="Jane", age > 18, occupation="job seeker").
[11:41:05] <ross> how does that relate to your question?
[11:41:13] <recursiveNode> ross I need to code a new, original architecture for such a system. But, what's a new architecture? Is it a bunch of new components? Or is it something that gives a higher performance?
[11:41:28] <ross> why does the architecture need to be new or original?
[11:42:32] <recursiveNode> because in addition to a traditional development (to code something that works), it must contribute to knowledge
[11:43:40] <ross> sounds like your project has an unnecessary requirements that will only add stress and anxiety to development time. your contribution can be the knowledge that it's ok to leverage exisitng work and that you don't have to be doing something new all the time in order to make something successful

[13:08:09] <ross> mrig: sure thing, I will do that
[13:08:45] <recursiveNode> miriam_ do you wanna be a backend developer, or a frontend developer? node.js, Java, Python, C++, or something else?
[13:09:04] <mrig> If you are wanting a priority queue system in database, then the design would be somewhat different for sure.
[13:10:17] <rindolf> vlc leaks slowly but surely
[13:10:44] <recursiveNode> so a new architecture is new core classes of the software
[13:11:25] <rindolf> miriam_: i'd suggest using pyside2
[13:11:30] <recursiveNode> it's a new codebase for the absolute core of the project...
[13:12:46] <recursiveNode> by coming up with a new requirement that existing similar projects don't address, and yet the requirement is of interest to business, and it impacts the core of the project, I should get a new core architecture, right?
[13:14:13] <recursiveNode> here are some non-functional requirements. I can choose one or two from the list that existing projects don't offer: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_system_quality_attributes

[13:24:40] *** Joins: LucaTM (~LucaTM@user/lucatm)
[13:28:14] <ross> mrig: I have drawn an example. I have a table 'TAGS' containing tags. Tags can be applied to both articles (of table 'ARTICLES') and comments (of table 'COMMENTS'). There is a single many-to-many linking table, 'TAGGING' that stores the relationship between tag and articles/comments. In that table, the column 'OBJ_ID' stores the ID of the article/comment as a foreign key, and 'OBJ_TYPE' stores a string that tells the database which table to look in
[13:28:17] <ross> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/sU7GaLJm/IMG_20210704_095528.jpg
[13:28:38] *** Quits: img (~img@user/img) (Quit: ZNC 1.8.2 - https://znc.in)
[13:28:49] <ross> so e.g. if OBJ_TYPE is the string "article" or something, it knows that OBJ_KEY is a foreign key of the ARTICLES table
[13:29:03] <ross> this is my current solution, I am wondering if there is a better way to do this
[13:29:31] <ross> e.g. an alternative would be to create a table for article tagging, and a table for comment tagging

[13:33:07] <mrig> It is not currently very clear what your structure is trying to achieve.
[13:34:09] <mrig> Your article is the principle entity right?
[13:34:32] <ross> what is a principle entity?
[13:35:21] *** Quits: img (~img@user/img) (Quit: ZNC 1.8.2 - https://znc.in)
[13:36:04] <mrig> The logical starting point I suppose, the noun the thing ...
[13:36:42] <mrig> I think that you could just link the comments table to tagging table.
[13:36:44] *** Joins: img (~img@user/img)
[13:36:53] <ross> I guess so - an article has tags, and it has comments
[13:36:58] <ross> a comment also has tags
[13:37:10] <mrig> Presumably you would like to have the possibility of having more than one comment per tagged relationship?
[13:38:33] <ross> I don't know what you mean by that. a single row in the 'TAGGED' table stores a relationship between a single tag and a single article/comment
[13:38:55] <mrig> ok, then it could be the case that a comment is an article, that is self referential.
[13:39:03] <mrig> You could do that I mean.
[13:39:21] <ross> that is true, but that's my fault for coming up with a poor example
[13:39:30] <ross> that solution does not apply to my actual situation
[13:39:34] <mrig> Would it be useful to include the user id of the person that creates an article?
[13:39:50] <mrig> if so then there would be no reason not to do this.
[13:39:54] *** Quits: img (~img@user/img) (Client Quit)
[13:40:01] <mrig> that I can see at a glance.
[13:40:19] <ross> the user id is not relevant, I only added it to fill out the example

[13:41:41] <mrig> Right well the sky is not the limit, you can do this in a multiple ways, you would need to really cleanly define what the use case is though.

[15:50:25] <recursiveNode> mrig yes, the highest level is you become a CEO. It doesn't happen via experience. It happens by taking additional modules to get you to the next level, one by one. After you're a solutions architect (no longer an engineer), you can take further training to become a manager (project manager, or general manager in IT, whatever) and then you can take further training to understand sales, marketing, products, services
[15:50:25] <recursiveNode> and then finally you can take training to understand busienss strategy, how it is implemented, measured, etc. and at that time you can be a CEO.
[15:50:57] <recursiveNode> mrig so, instead of hacking on code and making $100,000/y you can be hacking on strategy and making $300,000/y

[17:16:57] <mrig> sandman13: why would you have lines that long though?
[17:17:40] <mrig> I came across that once when someone had put images in a database.
[17:17:44] <sandman13> mrig: cause I don't know how to break them, without breaking some stuff
[17:18:02] <mrig> ah, I wrote a vim script that added \n a 80 chars

[17:28:47] <sandman13> "I fart in your general direction"
[17:28:49] <pikapika> farn, "Voivode" means a noble or military lord in Polish
[17:28:53] <Arahael> And it's pretty darn fundamental.

[17:31:45] <mrig> yes right.

[17:32:39] *** Joins: node1 (~node1@user/node1)
[17:32:39] <Arahael> mrig: I found out that the reason my view wasn't updating, was because...  The parent view apparently checks all of it's state, clears the 'touched' property, draws the view, then observes what was 'touched', the trouble was... I had, like any good developer, refactored my subview to a new component that uses it's own copy of it's data.
[17:32:44] <AlexDelarge> wasn't there a speed metal band called voivod?
[17:32:50] <mrig> pikapika: the applications work on any network though, including tor.
[17:33:03] <Arahael> mrig: Since the new component never touches the parent's bindings, they're never read, and therefore, SwiftUI infers that the subview never needs to be updated again!
[17:33:07] <mrig> Which is nice, and I think that there are added security advantages too.
[17:33:08] <pikapika> mrig, guiding any kind of process is always painful in a web app
[17:33:13] <pikapika> Web apps are best when each page is independent
[17:33:39] <mrig> right yes, the old separation of concerns.
[17:34:07] <mrig> Arahael: oh there is some hidden observer pattern going on?

[17:35:02] <mrig> heh
[17:35:28] <mrig> actually rofl would be more precise.
[17:35:47] <Arahael> mrig: I managed to fix it by cerimoniously sending a copy of the "binding" to the child view, and just reading from it.
[17:36:14] <Arahael> But now the child view has a "bindign" it otherwise doesn't care about, so it's wierd and just bizarre. :(

[17:37:11] <Trashlord> unnatural?
[17:37:15] <Trashlord> what does that mean in this context?
[17:37:20] <pikapika> All frameworks are just a way of trying to paper over the hideousness

[17:44:33] <mrig> seems that the samesite strict options and tls up the anti a bit, make them far more usable.
[17:44:33] <pikapika> In fact if you aren't careful with this, your user could bypass auth by a "counting attack"
[17:44:59] <pikapika> ie for example if your token of a user being logged in is a cookie with his pk

[17:46:02] <Trashlord> pikapika: but if the request requires some form of identification to allow any progress to be made with it, then you can just block anything that doesn't meet this criteria

[18:44:23] <sandman13> This is *after* you have granted permission
[18:44:39] <Donitz> exactly
[18:44:42] <sandman13> Usually you have to.
[18:44:48] <Donitz> not really

[18:45:09] <AlexDelarge> places like that make the ToS so long most ppl tl;dr them
[18:45:12] <Donitz> permissions are denied by default usually
[18:46:00] <sandman13> Leakage is something that I am worried about
[18:46:12] <Donitz> permission leakage?
[18:46:22] <sandman13> yup. Say Location
[18:46:47] <Donitz> I have personally noticed that android apps are way more aggressive in asking for superflous permissions
[18:46:53] <sandman13> You have many apps which ask you to turn on location temporarily but you, yourself, have to make sure that you turn it off later on.
[18:46:54] <Donitz> I prefer iPhone
[18:47:01] <Donitz> for that, and for the reason that Android sandboxing isn't as good

[18:48:12] <Donitz> I generally use reputable apps in iOS, and they rarely ask for unneccesary permissions
[18:48:22] <Donitz> maybe something like whatsapp does
[18:48:30] <InPhase> I've greatly appreciated the android permission nuance added of "when I'm actively using it".
[18:48:40] <sandman13> Security wise they are a bit saner
[18:48:53] <Donitz> that sounds really good InPhase
[18:48:56] <Donitz> maybe I should consider android again
[18:49:13] <Donitz> though, is not not true that permission leakege is way worse in android
[18:49:16] <Donitz> compared to iOS
[18:49:20] <InPhase> There are a vast many apps I'm willing to grant much greater permission when I have them open, but I really don't want them doing anything when closed.  So I think this was a huge boost for android permissions.  It was added, what, a few years back now?  Something like that.
[18:49:43] <sandman13> but at the end of the day, all it takes is one order from US government.
[18:49:44] <Donitz> afaik there have been several ways for apps on android to get access to the system
[18:50:13] <Donitz> I sound like an apple shill
[18:50:15] <InPhase> There used to be some Google Play methods of end-running around permissions, but I think most of the abused ones of those got locked down.
[18:50:23] <Donitz> but it's just that I don't have the patience to worry about security on every device
[18:50:43] <sandman13> and for other countries, if Apple/Google really want, they can get away with spying.
[18:50:47] <InPhase> I'm not convinced iphone security is any better than android.
[18:51:08] <Donitz> it's more that, apple/google spying is less likely to be maliciously destructive

[19:12:20] <InPhase> pikapika: Mathematicians who learned programming 20+ years ago and didn't change their computing approaches since then tend to love C and Fortran.  But most people have upgraded to other approaches to numerical computing.
[19:12:51] <xy0> whats the modern way of doing numerical computing besides matlab?

[19:13:17] <Donitz> r for just randomly doing math and graphs
[19:13:42] <InPhase> xy0: "front-end" for numerical work means writing the higher level parts of analyses.

[19:15:55] <pikapika> Yes
[19:16:05] <pikapika> Asm is also always popular
[19:16:09] <xy0> do you guys think something like rust will "replace" languages like c for os-programming for exmaple?
[19:16:29] <pikapika> xy0, never. Some part of the stack always has to deal with the unsafe shit.
[19:16:30] <Trashlord> there's already an OS written entirely in Rust
[19:16:34] <Trashlord> called Redux, I think
[19:16:41] <psydroid> Redox
[19:17:10] <xy0> yeah but I mean completely replace. But I guess pikapika already answered this
[19:17:26] <psydroid> it can and it has in the context of Redox
[19:17:41] <psydroid> but that is something that has been developed in Rust from scratch
[19:17:42] <pikapika> I think redox people ran a bash inside it
[19:17:46] <Trashlord> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox_(operating_system)
[19:17:49] <pikapika> Which means C again
[19:18:16] <InPhase> pikapika: Well, my career is largely focused on numerical computing, and has been for about the last 20 years.  I never liked Fortran, and I stopped making new things in C about 15 some years ago.
[19:19:48] <pikapika> InPhase, obviously some people probably dislike them
[19:19:49] <InPhase> pikapika: I DID like C a lot for a long stretch of time, because it used to be the fastest thing available.  But it's not the fastest thing available anymore.  You can write clean C++ code that runs faster than clean C code now.
[19:19:50] <pikapika> But as I said
[19:20:00] <pikapika> I like C++ too
[19:20:18] <pikapika> I consider it philosophically in the same region as C and fortran
[19:20:40] <pikapika> InPhase, yes C++ offers you a lot of compile time features
[19:20:47] <beaky> nice i like c++
[19:21:00] <pikapika> C++ is also generally very well liked
[19:21:45] <InPhase> I consider the differences important for mathematical work.  Because C++ supports customized types, you can make customized types which exhibit the properties of mathematical constructs you want to work with.  I find this pretty important when working with things like complex values, matrices, operators, and so on.
[19:22:03] <pikapika> Yes operator overloading is very pleasant
[19:23:01] <Donitz> I don't find the sacrifice of using C/C++ worth it unless you're working with embedded systems or making some kind of engine/framework from scratch
[19:23:17] <Donitz> takes too much boilerplate to get started with simple stuff
[19:23:38] <Donitz> I'll take the performance hit
[19:23:48] <pikapika> Donitz, its not about performance for me
[19:23:50] <pulse> Donitz, that's typically not a problem 3 projects in. by then you already have all the boilerplate and you just copy/paste
[19:23:58] <pikapika> Its about having some idea where the mallocs and frees are happening.
[19:24:02] <InPhase> Donitz: If your simple stuff samples from some common sets, you can basically eliminate that boilerplate with some good libraries kept readily available.
[19:24:14] <Donitz> I work around that issue by using object pools/caching stuff pikapika
[19:24:21] <Donitz> I generally avoid freeing stuff doing runtime
[19:24:24] <Donitz> and I don't have many issues
[19:24:40] <pikapika> Donitz, one is still working against the language trying to control allocations when you are not using C or C++
[19:24:41] *** Joins: ixil (~ixil@82.197.178.137)
[19:24:50] <Donitz> it's not really allocations that's the issue
[19:24:53] <pikapika> esp if it is too rigidly typed
[19:24:54] <Donitz> it's the freeing that is the problem
[19:24:58] <pikapika> C has the right balance
[19:24:59] <Donitz> since you want it to be controlled
[19:25:09] <pikapika> Yes
[19:25:13] <Donitz> but as I said, just pool things entirely
[19:25:13] <pikapika> Nobody knows when something will be freed

[19:25:31] <Donitz> that's how I do my games too

[19:25:46] <pikapika> Many people have managed to write games in Java so its apparently possible
[19:25:50] <Donitz> since I built the pooling right into the entity base class
[19:26:13] <InPhase> Scope-based resourcing makes things much cleaner.  It's more than just freeing, it's clean-up that matters.  And deterministic clean-up is a huge architectural asset.
[19:26:17] <pikapika> Donitz, do you like have a static MyObject pool[] and a factory that returns objects from it?
[19:26:35] <pikapika> Yes yes raii is very useful
[19:27:22] <Donitz> I do something like: CustomEntity : Entity. CustomEntity.create(...) - Returns entity from pool or creates a new entity, calls .reset(). entity.destroy() pools the entity
[19:27:35] <Donitz> so it's fairly transparent
[19:27:41] <pikapika> Apparently fortran uses INTENT keyword to declare which variables are by reference
[19:27:43] <Donitz> ofc the object pools grows infinitely
[19:27:46] <Donitz> but that's a small sacrifice
[19:27:52] <InPhase> Far too few languages have embraced the benefits of scope-based resource management.  And this is why Rust has the attention and hype it does, as it's one of the only modern language designs to really embrace this advantage.

[19:48:50] <paul424> vdamewood, so what's easier to port ? I see lots of steam games has problems to run on wine, while the native ones ( altough usually for that way older ones as well ) has much less problems ...
[19:49:32] <pikapika> paul424, are you running steam through wine or just using native steam for the wine part
[19:49:42] <vdamewood> paul424: I'm not quite sure what you're asking.
[19:49:48] <InPhase> pikapika: Six weeks to calculate a weather forecast probably eliminates the "fore" aspect.  :)
[19:49:57] <pikapika> Because sometimes steam itself uses a wine internally
[19:50:02] <pikapika> InPhase, yes

[19:54:43] <pikapika> Donitz, video games are a subtle topic
[19:54:53] <pikapika> I know if I write any they'd have the proper native linux versions
[19:55:03] <Donitz> yes, but often games are made in frameworks which can easily export cross-platform
[19:55:04] <Donitz> such as unity
[19:55:09] <Donitz> tons of games are made in unity these days
[19:55:16] <Donitz> and those can easily be exported for linux native
[19:55:23] <vdamewood> pikapika: How would you handle incompatible distros?
[19:55:27] <pikapika> Do older engines like unreal have linux support?
[19:55:34] <pikapika> vdamewood, incompatible in what sense?
[19:55:37] <Donitz> there are many unreal engines
[19:55:42] <Donitz> I bet the newer ones can
[19:55:47] <pikapika> I hope to just let "opengl" handle the difficulties as far as I can
[19:55:53] <vdamewood> pikapika: A binary works on one distro, but crashes on another.
[19:56:14] <pikapika> vdamewood, not a personal problem for me because anyone is free to build mine
[19:56:40] <vdamewood> pikapika: So, your solution is to release the source code to your game?

[19:58:41] <pikapika> vdamewood, it must also be remembered that for certain classes of games the meat of the logic can be easily implemented as a traditional interactive cui too
[19:58:47] <pikapika> ie rpg types
[19:59:51] <Donitz> well, it's not like game logic changes between platforms
[19:59:59] <Donitz> ah
[20:00:13] <pikapika> Donitz, and I meant that the game in practice can be almost or wholly be built as a cui too in these cases
[20:00:24] <Donitz> can you give an example
[20:00:26] <pikapika> and may be later turned into a graphical version with not much trouble

[23:51:16] <AlexDelarge> however you do it its going to take a long time

[23:53:02] <xeno> if you wanna insert 15000 rows, use a prepared statement, and commit maybe all of them at once, or if that's too much then 3000 or 5000 at a time
