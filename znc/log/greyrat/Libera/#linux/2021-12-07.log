[01:09:04] <SpeakerToMeat> fikran, if you mean nvidia drivers, I've never used mint, but it's very probable when you installed the kernel the header package for the new kernel wasn't installed, thus the kernel driver shim couldn't be compiled by dkms or whatever mechanism mint uses
[01:10:07] <BinarySavior> n-iCe you could try running it with wine
[01:10:09] <SpeakerToMeat> fikran, you can check your kernel version with uname -r and then see if your package manager has something similar to "kernel-headers-<version>" (sorry this is the naming on debian not sure in mint)
[01:10:25] <fikran> sure, I believe it was 5.4 earlier
[01:10:31] <fikran> The oddity is, my mouse didn't work then :)

[01:10:46] <SpeakerToMeat> If your system is "well designed", and specially using something like dkms, probably the kernel module will be rebuilt as soon as you finish installing the package

[03:41:23] <EtherMan> So umm... I'm running into a small issue here. I need to write to a USB, that is using UDF as the fs. The stick gets mounted ro, but it won't allow me to remount to rw, because "is write-protected"... Even though I just wrote the iso to it. Hdparm says it's not read only. Yet mount thinks it is...

[03:57:29] <Bruda> Probably have to ask Microsoft how they imagined people putting that DVD image on a USB drive and using the UDF filesystem contained in it. Because the process you used to write it to USB wrote it as a RO CDROM.
[03:58:07] <ananke> Bruda: they have their own tool to write a bootable usb image from the iso
[03:58:47] <EtherMan> Bruda: The iso is literally for writing to USB... MS doesn't even support DVD installations anymore...

[04:00:17] <EtherMan> "UDF shares the basic volume descriptor format with ISO 9660."   Wouldn't that be why the file -s says it's iso 9660?
[04:00:43] <Bruda> Ah. All I can say is I've never wrote an ISO to usb and mounted it RW before. So I guess what happened makes sense to me, but clearly there's more to this image than the iso's I've used in the past. Windows 10 included. Haven't done any windows 11 iso's.

[10:32:49] <kek_> so I just installed i3blocks yesterday and use the default battery script. I'm confused, it keeps showing 0% battery/discharging. It uses acpi command which shows me "Battery 0: Discharging, 0%, rate information unavailable; Battery 1: Unknown, 97%; Battery 2: Discharging, 0%, rate information unavailable". Yesterday I paniced haha, thought my laptop went to heaven so I booted windows and it showed 99%, after rebooting into arch
[10:32:49] <kek_> i3blocks showed it correctly. Any idea why I have 3 batteries/labels?
[10:33:11] <kek_> Did I download too many batteries? :p

[12:27:36] <[twisti]> now im additionally confused as to what zram is. as best i can tell is ... its using a region of ram ... to provide ram ... so when you run out of ram, you can use swap ... in that region of ram, which provides ram. which it has been all along.

[14:03:50] <naquad> hi. is there some common binary format for data that has a tooling? i'm looking for something like pack from scripting languages but usable via command line and preferably having a library
[14:04:26] <jim> [twisti], sure :) if you have nc installed, you can pastebin the output of an arbitrary command, for example ls -CF if you run it like this: ls -CF | nc termbin.com 9999
[14:05:13] <[twisti]> jim: thanks, thats also good to know, but i was just looking for the pastebin site itself
[14:05:30] <jim> naquad, something that lets you use the pieces of pack?
[14:05:55] <[twisti]> i guess ill end up running my own
[14:06:01] <jim> pastebin.com
[14:06:06] <jim> err
[14:06:14] <jim> termbin.com
[14:06:50] <[twisti]> at a glance, that doesnt seem to allow pasting through the website, nor supports accounts and presets like unlisted by default
[14:06:55] <jim> and if you browse that on the web, it links to a git repo where you can make your own termbin
[14:07:24] <[twisti]> ah, yeah, it links to fiche, which ive heard of before
[14:07:36] <jim> ok
[14:08:00] <naquad> jim, i've been thinking about something that looks like rrdtool: being able to create a record set in a specified binary format, read, write, and update it

[15:32:07] <lovetruth> Hello :)
[15:32:13] <lovetruth> Here's an interesting question... :)
[15:32:39] <def_> hexnewbie: Can you help me with the problem, please?
[15:32:45] <lovetruth> I have a systemd service that should create and start several systemd services (units)...
[15:33:12] <lovetruth> The problem is:   the script creates (using systemctl) the services, but it does not start them :)
[15:33:34] <hexnewbie> def_: No. But someone using dwm might, possibly, if you share any details. My experience with suckless has been, well, install the thing, successfully crash it within 2 minutes, remove it.
[15:33:50] <def_> haha
[15:34:02] *** Joins: t0kie (~t0kie@user/t0kie)

[15:34:09] <lovetruth> I tried adding them to the declared target of systemd (I created another target, called "video.target") (using "WantedBy=video.target" under the [Install] section of the unit)
[15:34:25] <def_> Whenever I click a link it crashes, sometimes it takes multiple clicks
[15:34:57] <hexnewbie> def_: I don't know. I suspect opening a web site link involves either opening a web browser, or opening a new window in a web browser (which browser), or perhaps navigating from one URL to another URL in the same browser window. That would be a start

[15:56:51] <fdkff> i found a similar bug, but it is from 2014
[15:57:26] <MrElendig> if mount works, then you can track down what causes udiskctl to mount it owned by root and not writable by you
[15:57:37] <EtherMan> Certainly, certainly. Most fuse drivers are just plain bad. That's not limited to vfat really. But it does allow users to mount without setuid and stuff so still useful.

[18:03:58] <CoJaBo> So this should be fun. I now have to track down versions of Avidemux, Virtualdub, and FFMPEG from circa 2007, to attempt to repeat a project that I originally failed at

[18:07:25] <CoJaBo> hodapp: I'm actually leaning towards trying to find the Windows versions, as there seem to be more sites that archive Windows software.. but yeh, I'm completely anticipating having to replicate a decades-old build env D=
[18:07:28] <ananke> this amount of effort may be better spent at trying to do it with newer versions
[18:07:40] <CoJaBo> Actually, VDub might be Windows-only :/

[23:41:59] <jimm> I don't think so, because you'd be suspending the computer's entire operatons, and that includes networking
[23:42:17] <ananke> davidv7: that's not how suspend works
[23:42:48] <davidv7> ok is there something that works like what i described but with a different name?
[23:43:14] <jimm> maybe the best way to do that is to prevent your screen from shutting off
[23:43:30] <ananke> davidv7: what's the actual problem you're trying to solve?
[23:43:37] <hodapp> you can set your display to sleep without having the whole machine sleep
[23:43:40] <ananke> in plain english

[23:52:41] <davidv7> i'm just wondering if there's something that lets me do what i've described
[23:52:45] <jimm> hibernate is suspend-to-disk, while sleep is suspend to ram
[23:52:48] <ananke> davidv7: look at https://onlinehelp.ncr.com/Retail/Workstations/7613/HTML/Topics/UserGuide/5.%20Power%20Management/3-ACPI%20Sleep%20States%20(S0%20-%20S5).htm

[23:54:23] <Mat1010> Hello colleagues. I need the name of a plain text editor. Let me change text size
[23:54:24] <ananke> the G0/S0 is as close as you can get to power saving, while still executing code
[23:54:26] <jimm> yeah, that one should prevent suspend based on a timer
[23:54:29] <davidv7> you told me to not suspend

[23:58:54] <Mat1010> no
[23:59:17] <Mat1010> it's not so bad
[23:59:44] <jimm> note, that plain text doesn't have a "setting" for font size, so you can't save that with the document
