[01:07:30] <Aurora_v_kosmose> oh nvm, fiction misled me, it seems to dffer by state.
[01:07:36] <Berlin36> that's about the only time i've watched a video of him
[01:07:36] <dweltstorm> i watced that wen i was like 8

[01:07:48] <Berlin36> lol, it was so much time ago omg

[01:08:23] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Japan doesn't like him much.
[01:08:27] <Berlin36> xd
[01:08:42] <dweltstorm> dont think anyone likes him ver much
[01:08:44] <Berlin36> Of course there'll be some hanged guys there
[01:08:53] <Aurora_v_kosmose> dweltstorm: heh
[01:08:53] <Berlin36> that's why it's called suicide forest you fucking genius
[01:09:01] <Berlin36> xd
[01:09:07] <dweltstorm> yeah what was he thinking
[01:09:23] <dweltstorm> didnt he also like kill his hamster
[01:09:31] <Berlin36> the fuc-
[01:09:48] <dweltstorm> idk i remember hearing something like that
[01:10:13] <Berlin36> do you watch pewdiepie?
[01:10:18] <dweltstorm> no
[01:10:30] <dweltstorm> i did when e played minecraft
[01:10:40] <Berlin36> i sometimes watch some of his videos
[01:11:07] <Berlin36> seems like a nice guy
[01:11:12] <dweltstorm> idk i dont love reaction style content
[01:11:45] <Berlin36> i don't watch youtube very often now
[01:12:03] <dweltstorm> hes also done a bunch of bad stuff
[01:12:13] <dweltstorm> i dont really want to support him
[01:12:16] <Berlin36> what did he do
[01:12:46] <dweltstorm> paid some kids in india to write "kill all jews" on a sign and dance around it
[01:13:02] <Berlin36> lmao what
[01:13:07] <dweltstorm> yeah
[01:13:12] <Berlin36> lol
[01:13:28] <Berlin36> messed up
[01:13:42] <dweltstorm> he also said the n word on stream
[01:14:17] <Berlin36> huh, i see
[01:14:30] <dweltstorm> i like danny gonzalez and kurtis conner
[01:14:33] <Aurora_v_kosmose> heh I remember that
[01:14:39] <Aurora_v_kosmose> @ sign
[01:15:03] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ~70% of my youtube use is vtubers. The rest is music & animation.
[01:15:26] <Berlin36> at the moment i watch some videos on golang
[01:15:26] <dweltstorm> have you watched izzimouse
[01:15:30] <Berlin36> and mainly music, yeah
[01:15:43] <Berlin36> what's izzimouse
[01:15:49] <dweltstorm> hes a vtuber who does art and videogames
[01:15:55] <Berlin36> oh
[01:16:09] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Oh. Shit. Right. Hm... For programming I'm more of a blogpost-guide type, but for soldering and other hardware-related stuff, definitely video guides.
[01:16:37] <Berlin36> yeye, i also enjoy reading, if it's related to programming
[01:16:52] <dweltstorm> yeah i always end up having to squint to watch programming tutorials
[01:16:54] <Berlin36> though i like video format if i need some explanation with examples and stufd
[01:16:56] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I like fiction a lot in general, but I also read nonfiction.
[01:17:10] <dweltstorm> i used to read all the time
[01:17:18] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Video just isn't the best format for mostly-static content like programs.
[01:17:21] <Berlin36> i don't really read books now
[01:17:21] <dweltstorm> but my attention span has shortened so much
[01:17:29] <Aurora_v_kosmose> If it lacks explanations and examples, it's just a badly written article.
[01:17:33] <Berlin36> especially programmimg books, they seem so hard to finish omg
[01:17:44] <dweltstorm> i loved ready player one tho
[01:17:47] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Berlin36: Depends on which ones.
[01:17:56] <Berlin36> and sometimes i just get tired of reading
[01:18:06] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It's relatively easy to finish even the boring ones when commute was still a thing though.
[01:18:28] <dweltstorm> ive been trying to get new adhd meds so ill probably start reading again
[01:18:30] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Stare at the back of the head of the guy sitting in front of you in the bus/metro/train for an hour and half, or read prog book?
[01:18:38] <MootPoot> The problem with programming books is that they leave out a bunch of stuff for newbs  - programming books are good when you have a fairly decent idea of what you're doing or have prior experience
[01:18:41] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I obviously chose the second option.
[01:18:48] <Berlin36> oh right
[01:19:04] <MootPoot> and also they have like, no help if you get stuck
[01:19:10] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: Well, that's because most programming books are about specific languages or frameworks. Intro to computer-science types of books are needed for basics.
[01:19:14] <Berlin36> programming books always start in the same way lmao
[01:19:24] * Aurora_v_kosmose unironically recommending SICP
[01:19:45] <dweltstorm> i got this free python book that i still havent read
[01:19:46] <dweltstorm> oh yeah
[01:20:02] <dweltstorm> does anyone know how to convert a space to unicode in python
[01:20:03] <MootPoot> unfortunately nobody really says "go read this intro to CS book" first for learning programming
[01:20:16] <MootPoot> they go to "learn python in 24 hours" kind of books
[01:20:22] <MootPoot> and that's unfortunately the default
[01:20:24] <Berlin36> i've a lot of pirated books lol, now that i said that, i feel the responsibility to read them
[01:20:25] <dweltstorm> i used ord() to convert the text but it didnt work for spaces
[01:20:48] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Yeah, and the python in 24 hours type is basically aimed at working programmers who've never touched Python and need to learn it for their new job
[01:21:14] <Berlin36> i mwan it's not bad if you already know programming, but not specifically python
[01:21:47] <dweltstorm> ive been trying to learn java and c# but i still dont understand all the object and class based stuff
[01:21:49] <Berlin36> there is a guy on youtube who literally did a video called "Go language in 12 minutes"
[01:21:59] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Berlin36: That's basically the point of most language-specific books.
[01:22:03] <Berlin36> oh dweltstorm i understand what you're feeling
[01:22:17] <Berlin36> but one day i was drinking tea and it SUDDENLY JUST ALL CAME INTO MY MIND
[01:22:18] <Aurora_v_kosmose> "Learning to code with X" can sometimes be intended as actual intros.
[01:22:20] <dweltstorm> im too scared to leave python lmao
[01:22:23] <Berlin36> i understood everything in that second
[01:22:36] <Berlin36> idk what was that, some programming revelation or shit

[01:32:45] <Berlin36> the bot thinks you're a spammer so yeah, pastebin'll be better

[01:39:49] <MootPoot> why are the corners such a big deal lol
[01:39:51] <MootPoot> its a corner
[01:39:54] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Then they removed it because they want you to waste time with the second-long animations instead of instantly switching.
[01:40:30] <not_dweltstorm> i should probably switch to linux but the terminal scares me

[01:41:01] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: You can disable part of it, but it doesn't go quite as plain as you used to be able to.
[01:41:02] <MootPoot> Aurora_v_kosmose: yeah but its not like the windows are circular -  its like 10 pixels on each corner
[01:41:32] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Yeah, but instead of having small readable labels for buttons, now you have shitty blobs the size of my thumb.
[01:42:02] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And the text isn't even any bigger in them. So they're literally just wasting space.

[04:40:35] <amigojapan> I don't think Debian and arch are related at all MootPoot 
[04:40:38] <Aurora_v_kosmose> amigojapan: Not really, it's just inaccurate.
[04:41:05] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: https://kernelnewbies.org/LinuxVersions stuff like MPTCP is new stuff in the kernel

[04:41:43] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It is a pretty killer feature if you have multiple outgoing networks and a compliant server.

[04:42:15] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I think it's 5.9?
[04:42:44] <MootPoot> Seems like a feature that should have been around already for a while
[04:43:19] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: The spec was never really completed because of a bunch of issues with how corporations and ISPs have absolutely ruined the original internet spec implementations' intent
[04:43:35] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Also the scheduling and network pressure aspects are kinda complex
[04:44:18] <amigojapan> MootPoot: anyway forget about arch and try Debian
[04:44:56] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: Oh right, another detail: MPTCP has a legacy implementation that's basically on life-support now, this is the new one.
[04:45:08] <MootPoot> Aurora_v_kosmose: oh this works over the internet, not just local 
[04:45:09] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And by legacy I mean legacy spec, not legacy linux support
[04:45:11] <MootPoot> I see 
[04:45:13] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: Yes.
[04:45:19] <MootPoot> Yeah I was wondering 
[04:45:42] <MootPoot> At least for local lan I've seen this ages age on windows 
[04:45:46] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It basically has to deal with all the NAT-ing bullshit, all the network unreliability, random disconnects, QoS on multiple paths, etc.
[04:45:48] <MootPoot> If it's online then I see 
[04:45:57] <MootPoot> Why it's a good
[04:46:39] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Among other things, it allows for free TCP roaming.
[04:46:48] <Aurora_v_kosmose> As in "no additional setup required"
[04:46:58] <Aurora_v_kosmose> You just need multiple uplinks.
[04:47:07] <Aurora_v_kosmose> So on mobile that'd be wifi & mobile data.
[04:47:17] <Satin> Are you trolling?
[04:47:20] <Aurora_v_kosmose> no.
[04:47:22] <Satin> Arch isn't based on Debian 
[04:47:24] <Satin> Not you 
[04:47:29] <Satin> I mean MootPoot 
[04:47:58] <Aurora_v_kosmose> You could have a server with three different ISP uplinks, and when they're all up you get up to 3x speed on a given MPTCP connection.
[04:48:33] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And if they go down it doesn't just fail, it carries on.

[13:59:20] <Bco1981> that's what you do
[13:59:30] <MootPoot> and vice versa as well - I can just emulate a ARM linux build on my windows pc?

[14:02:29] <MootPoot> yeah but wont that run slow as fuck

[14:03:59] <Cryowolf> Im fine with a 2060 or 2050, just something better than 1060 so I can get something
[14:04:03] <Cryowolf> no situation is the same
[14:04:07] <Cryowolf> around 60% survival
[14:04:11] <MootPoot> ah
[14:04:14] <Cryowolf> which is still low
[14:04:18] <Cryowolf> rather low
[14:04:21] <MootPoot> why not just get a xbox one - they seem to be in stock
[14:04:31] <MootPoot> at least its something you can get your hands on 
[14:05:07] <Cryowolf> dunno, they dont have all games
[14:05:14] <MootPoot> nobody does
[14:05:54] <Cryowolf> but 60ish% survival chance is going up, so it will slowly tick upward to 90ish% unless theres a recurrence, which the risk is there for.
[14:05:58] <Cryowolf> I hope I never have one

[14:35:01] <Satin> it's a worthwhile article documentating a phemonona in public policy and assumptioions in US culture
[14:35:31] <Satin> just because the idea itself is a simple one, doesn't mean the consequences and how it's baked into US culture and policies and so on are not worth a piece.
[14:35:37] <MootPoot> that entire thing can be summerized into one like
[14:35:37] <MootPoot> lol
[14:35:40] <MootPoot> line*
[14:35:41] <Satin> not everything can be reduced to simple TL;DRs.
[14:35:42] <Satin> no.
[14:35:44] <MootPoot> it is
[14:35:47] <MootPoot> I just did it
[14:35:51] <Satin> no you didn't
[14:36:16] <MootPoot> throwing paragaphs of text as examples dosen't really somehow make the point more complex
[14:36:44] <Satin> certainly, but dismissing a piece or being reductive to single lines is no better
[14:36:52] <Satin> the paragraphs are worthwhile in this case
[14:37:13] <MootPoot> the paragraphs dont really do much - its like providing examples on why water is wet
[14:37:24] <MootPoot> anybody with 3 brain cells knows that
[14:37:27] <Satin> then you haven't read the article or you misunderstand it very much
[14:37:50] <Satin> Just because of the core *idea* is a simple paradoxical idea, once again, that doesn't mean the history of what happened, how it has impacted US public policy, and what could be done going from here are not worthwhile exploring.
[14:38:10] <Satin> Just because you referenced that core idea and reduced it to one line does not mean you captured the piece or what it is documenting or saying
[14:38:12] <Satin> or reporting on
[14:38:15] <MootPoot> put that in a seperate article
[14:38:17] <Satin> I'm not sure why you would think you did
[14:38:20] <Satin> what?
[14:38:51] <MootPoot> If you want that then they should have chosen a more fitting title
[14:39:01] <MootPoot> imo
[14:39:13] <Satin> -.-
[14:39:35] <Satin> I mean, I agree that articles have gotten more clickbaitey with titles, but it is still on you for jumping the gun and asserting it's reductible to that.
[14:39:48] <Satin> But whatever. It's not my interest to casigate that or your initial reading of it. Just my two cents.
[14:39:48] <MootPoot> I'm not jumping the gun
[14:40:12] <Satin> Yes you did when you asserted that the entire article can be reduced to a line. It was pretty reductive and didn't capture what the piece was reporting on.
[14:40:32] <MootPoot> but it can
[14:40:37] <Satin> And it misunderstood the point being made too. As if it was just a lesson on some idea.

[14:54:09] <amigojapan> Hi there Berlin36 
[14:54:10] <Urchin[emacs]> Satin: starting off, there was a debate on masks in the scientific circles, as then current models of aerosol propagations used by epidemiologists were outdated, and calibrated to tuberculosis, which is a heavy bacteria that has to get deep inside the lungs, while coronavirus is much lighter and merely has to get in the nose to cause trouble, so spreads as aerosol a lot more easily, this was not appreciated at the time
[14:54:19] <darkwitch> Berlin36, you will be famous too
[14:54:28] <MootPoot> amigojapan: do you think art is for the most part currently - a way to hide/stash money

[14:55:37] <Satin> I don't disagree that part of what you're saying were factors, but that doesn't invalidate the fact that the mentality is baked into the culture/system etc which is what the article is exploring
[14:55:52] <Satin> certainly there's no one reason for why they didn't take the steps they dhould have early on
[14:56:02] <Satin> s
[14:56:17] <Berlin36> art is beautiful, but being an artist's life is not fair
[14:56:29] <darkwitch> Berlin36, first you make some art, earning nothing and living in poverty, then you die and the money starts moving

[14:58:35] <MootPoot> you mean - art houses/auction houses sponsor content to suddenly blow up a random creator after they die and then under the table buy all the stuff beforehand when its cheap and then sell it to rich fucks
[14:59:05] <MootPoot> then those rich fucks wait till the hype is even bigger and sell it to the next rich fuck

[15:10:00] <Berlin36> well i consider mona lisa to be fantastic because it was made like in the 1500's
[15:10:05] <Urchin[emacs]> fetish art is underrated :P
[15:10:25] <MootPoot> Urchin[emacs]: +1
[15:10:27] <Satin> i already voiced stronger opinions on this stuff the other day
[15:10:31] <Satin> i have no energy now
[15:10:39] <MootPoot> can we display some BDSM in place of the mona lisa
[15:10:48] <Berlin36> welp
[15:10:50] <MootPoot> I wanna see some masochist girls get whipped and cum nonstop
[15:10:52] <Berlin36> i guess we could
[15:10:53] <Berlin36> but
[15:10:57] <Berlin36> do we actually need that
[15:11:01] <MootPoot> yes
[15:11:02] <MootPoot> we do
[15:11:04] <Berlin36> oh
[15:11:05] <Berlin36> then
[15:11:06] <Berlin36> go on
[15:11:12] <MootPoot> more then looking at mona lisa and boring shit

[15:11:54] <MootPoot> the only problem with that is that the entire queue will just be 5000000 dudes with erections
[15:12:06] <Berlin36> oh right right
[15:12:20] <Berlin36> how do you solve this 
[15:12:29] <Berlin36> oh i got an idea
[15:12:49] <Berlin36> make it like 50 x 50 meters so 500000 dudes can watch it at the same time
[15:12:53] <MootPoot> only let horny lesbians in

[15:12:58] <MootPoot> oh

[15:13:34] <MootPoot> as a art piece that is state sponsored
[15:13:39] <Berlin36> it depends on how much it costs
[15:13:45] <MootPoot> free
[15:13:48] <Berlin36> then
[15:13:49] <Urchin[emacs]> MootPoot: you disgust me

[15:14:02] <Berlin36> Urchin[emacs], it's for free

[15:14:38] <MootPoot> yeah
[15:14:41] <Urchin[emacs]> MootPoot: I am, but your approach to it disgusts me
[15:14:44] <MootPoot> he posts lesbian smut nonstop
[15:14:47] <Berlin36> lol
[15:14:50] <MootPoot> Urchin[emacs]: how would you do it
[15:15:07] <Berlin36> MootPoot, i guess that having that channel run nonstop isn't very practical
[15:15:15] <MootPoot> just run it as a internet stream
[15:15:18] <Berlin36> it'll have views like only for 2 minutes or so
[15:15:18] <MootPoot> should be doable
[15:15:32] <amigojapan> Berlin36: I don't usually evaluate a picture by what date it is made in. Unless it's cave drawings

[15:24:28] <Berlin36> the piece itself doesn't seem to be very hard 
[15:24:36] <Satin> idk what the definition of average for this is, she just doesn't perform that well for a YT music channel for covers, and it's pretty obvious to people that do play ithat with her arrangments

[15:38:52] <MootPoot> any color that isen't their default hair color or was their default hair color
[15:40:00] <Satin> amigojapan: I wouldn't say it's a term made up by the american right, but it's used in a very prejoriative manner and people who use it can't even define it
[15:40:25] <Satin> it's just essentially a shortcut insult used as code for "things I don't like, these guys are extreme, unreasonable, crazy, too sensitive"
[15:40:43] <Satin> I use it once in a while as shortcut language as well, but I just eyeroll when most people use it in most contexts and let it be
[15:41:56] <amigojapan> Satin: I don't think anyone originally identified as a social justice warrior
[15:42:02] <Satin> I don't agree with most people who use such terms too easily, but that doesn't mean I can't get along with them I suppose.

[15:45:27] <Satin> " From the early 1990s to the early 2000s, social-justice warrior was used as a neutral or complimentary phrase, as when a 1991 Montreal Gazette article describes union activist Michel Chartrand as a "Quebec nationalist and social-justice warrior".[1"

[15:46:19] <Urchin[emacs]> he's a warrior, and his aim is social justice (and galactic conquest)

[15:58:49] <Satin> gn amigojapan 
[15:58:54] <Satin> sleep well
[15:58:59] <amigojapan> Ty Satin gn
[15:59:07] <amigojapan> Ok I am out
[15:59:14] <MootPoot> Satin: the point is not that windows good - you are detracking here
[15:59:15] *** Quits: amigojapan (uid86330@helmsley.irccloud.com) ()
[15:59:35] <MootPoot> the point is linux is a pain to keep going
[15:59:44] <MootPoot> I know windows is shit in its own way
[15:59:48] <MootPoot> maybe unix is different
[15:59:53] <MootPoot> I really dont know
[16:00:45] <MootPoot> but for the userspace level - a extremely common element is "I spent 4 hours trying to get my thing working so I can do 1 hour of <normal task>"
[16:01:13] <MootPoot> absolutely a pro linux guy wont have that problem - but we're not all pro linux guys
[16:01:42] <Satin> no, my opinion, no offensive more than necessary intended is, your mindset about it is very disagreeable because you bring in a very Windows mindset into this and often complain about very trivial things that experience brings. If you complained when you actually knew what you were doing and had a fairer judgement that would be fair, but you don't, and you're fine to vent as you wish. It's not wrong, but y'know
[16:01:53] <Urchin[emacs]> MootPoot: it's a lot less of a pain to keep going if you're using something like Debian
[16:01:58] <faiL> should a begginer in linux, start using arch?
[16:02:16] <MootPoot> >Windows mindset
[16:02:17] <MootPoot> define this
[16:02:18] <Satin> it comes off like "UGHHHH i have to learn this thing, it's not like windows, grr!!!!" than "linux is not really good at this, but good at this."
[16:02:28] <Urchin[emacs]> faiL: no
[16:02:39] <faiL> why not?
[16:03:02] <Urchin[emacs]> faiL: it's complicated, very much not for beginners
[16:03:03] <MootPoot> >If you complained when you actually knew what you were doing and had a fairer judgement that would be fair, but you don't, and you're fine to vent as you wish.
[16:03:16] <MootPoot> I literally answered this above in the "pro linux user part"
[16:03:25] <Satin> Like the thing the other day with the teamviewer thing was incredibly simple and trivial, and if you were more patient and experienced you would agree as well. You were being unfairly dogpiled on by some people here including ami go and what not perhaps over it, but their responses weren't coming out of nowhere lol
[16:03:34] <MootPoot> your entire thing is basically - "git gud"
[16:03:52] <Urchin[emacs]> I mostly suggest people ease in and take something with similar user experience to what's in Windows, with a KDE-based beginner distro
[16:04:16] <Urchin[emacs]> though Debian is, these days, more user friendly than beginner distros were back when I was starting
[16:04:26] <Satin> no, my entire thing is, please have more patience and don't be unfair to a different OS with different terminology. It's fine and not illegal to vent, nor is it my position to tell you what to like or to prefer, but the quality of your criticitism, if there is any besides the venting, isn't really you know, experienced or anything
[16:04:46] <Satin> and I say this as a noob user in many ways myself, and very intermediate at best
[16:05:01] <faiL> i want to start using linux today, i was thing about these two extremes (ubunto because its easy, or arch because its hard but teach us more)
[16:05:08] <Satin> and I too agree with some points, such as linux being unnecessarily complicated, or with some people like the arch guys being annoying
[16:05:12] <faiL> should i go with ubunto?
[16:05:14] <Satin> but not with your sweeping generalizations or anything
[16:05:51] <Urchin[emacs]> faiL: if you really want to do a lot of studying, then arch is your thing, it's probably nowhere near as bad as when I was trying to get into it
[16:05:54] <Satin> just literally have more patience and try to be more accepting of the way other operating systems do things that are slightly more hands on in my opinion.
[16:06:14] <Satin> because when you start complaining about the way linux isn't point and click for installing files unlike on windows
[16:06:15] <Urchin[emacs]> (I'm talking about the system itself, not the difficulty curve)
[16:06:17] <Satin> that is VERY revealing
[16:06:20] <Satin> ...
[16:06:32] <MootPoot> Satin: how am I being unfair - I was trying to do a very basic task that any average user should be able to do with absolutely no problems - and the answer to that was "go into the terminal and then poke around in error logs and then poke around and find your problem and then poke around and find and edit a system level text file to get your extremely simple thing to work"
[16:06:41] <Urchin[emacs]> faiL: though note that you need a functioning computer to look at the manuals and maybe chat with people on #arch while installing
[16:07:11] <faiL> thank you, i'll join the channel
[16:07:20] <Satin> MootPoot: your issue was lack of knowledge and familiarity, and this is very basic familiarity that is necessary to understand what .deb files are like to install, and how the package manager works
[16:07:30] <Urchin[emacs]> MootPoot: wait, you don't even want to deal with the command line?
[16:07:33] <Satin> I don't know what else to tell you, honestly.
[16:07:41] <MootPoot> Satin: notice I never really complanied about using the terminal - I understand that its the normal way to do linux 
[16:07:59] <MootPoot> I complained about having to deep dive inside the terminal
[16:08:02] <Satin> MootPoot: you were complaining/having trouble with installing .deb files IIRC.
[16:08:04] <MootPoot> which are two different things
[16:09:03] <Satin> Urchin[emacs]: Yeah I don't even disagree with his point that linux can be unnecessairly complicated/unweildy at times, but I'm incredibly put off by how his level of linux is like lv 0.5, even lower than me who's a noob, and he's making sweeping generalizations and consistently offering his inexperienced opinion about it /shrug
[16:09:14] <MootPoot> ...
[16:09:21] <MootPoot> I mained linux for 2 years
[16:09:31] <MootPoot> back in 2007
[16:09:34] <Satin> then how do you have no idea of a package manager and .deb files?
[16:09:40] <Satin> fr
[16:09:41] <MootPoot> I know what a fucking package manager is 
[16:09:43] <MootPoot> jeez
[16:09:52] <Satin> the apt stuff the other day sure didn't sound like it
[16:09:52] <MootPoot> and what a deb file is
[16:10:02] <MootPoot> can you stop assuming
[16:10:03] <MootPoot> thanks
[16:10:27] <MootPoot> The problem is not using a package manager or a deb
[16:10:47] <MootPoot> the problem is that it shouldn't have to be "go edit your sources.list file manually" to get a simple package manager to work
[16:11:18] <Satin> is that really such a big deal to you? especially when the thing you were trying to install wasn't hosted on the mainline repos or whatever?
[16:11:30] <Satin> bruh
[16:11:38] <MootPoot> when you get in a car, and drive, you're expected to know how to drive the car; not "manually go into the engine ECU and edit the fuel/air mixture"
[16:11:56] <Urchin[emacs]> the biggest recent problem I had was due to Ubuntu shipping an ancient jpeg library (so people still build against it), and Debian not (which made one of the interfaces of a program not run on my computer), which was a bit complicated to solve, but not too bad once I actually took the time to do it
[16:12:13] <Satin> that's not complicated stuff or anything, you were trying to install teamviewer IIRC, which wasn't simply hosted in a mainline repo or whatever
[16:12:33] <Satin> and you had to modify the package manager for it or whatever presumbly to make that happen
[16:12:39] <Satin> that's not supposed to be complicated or a big deal poot
[16:12:56] <MootPoot> you're missing the point
[16:12:57] <MootPoot> again 
[16:12:58] <MootPoot> and again
[16:12:59] <Satin> it's pretty unfair IMHO for you to genreralize linux as very difficult from that sort of thing
[16:13:01] <MootPoot> and again
[16:13:16] <Satin> well you didn't say "very difficult" but you're saying it's complicated compared to windows or w/e
[16:13:26] <MootPoot> the issue is not that its too hard to do - the issue is that I had to do it at some point to get a basic task working
[16:13:34] <MootPoot> also I'm not comparing it to windows
[16:13:36] <Satin> !g every OS sucks youtube
[16:13:37] <ImoutoBot> Satin: Every OS sucks - YouTube <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d85p7JZXNy8> | Every OS Sucks - YouTube <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPRvc2UMeMI> | Every Os Sucks (Live) - YouTube <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqJZ9i8p-b0>
[16:13:38] <MootPoot> can you stop bringing it up
[16:14:07] <MootPoot> like its some kind of tell-tale thing about me
[16:14:17] <Satin> coz u mentioned it when the teamviewer thing happened
[16:14:37] <Satin> and you yourself have brought it up when talking about linux sucking
[16:15:02] <MootPoot> because its a easy comparison to go "it might be better if its like this" not, "windows is better hehehehehue"
[16:15:02] <Satin> but yes, I won't bring it up then
[16:15:09] <Satin> i get that
[16:15:10] <MootPoot> I could have just brought up macOS as well
[16:15:17] <MootPoot> and made the same point
[16:15:37] <Satin> Urchin[emacs]: what's the most user friendly linux distribution in your opinion?
[16:16:21] <Urchin[emacs]> Satin: I couldn't begin to give a fuck about that
[16:16:52] <Satin> MootPoot: Sorry if I'm being too harsh or critical, I guess I'm myself not being very reasonable because I'm 1% annoyed by reading stuff about linux when it doesn't feel like you're coming from a point of balanced judgement of appreciating it for what it is, and then being able to critique it fairly.
[16:16:53] <tcsilver> my dream is but a falacies fantasy now!
[16:17:02] <Urchin[emacs]> Satin: I'm using a manual tiling window manager as my main interface
[16:17:05] <Satin> tcsilver: ?
[16:17:09] <MootPoot> anyway - the issue is not that I have to turn on the water to the toilet to go take a shit, I'm okay with that on a technical level , the issue is that I think this is a bad expectation of a user who just wants to take a shit and be done with it -> one of the reasons why linux wont make it to the mainstream 
[16:17:09] <Satin> Urchin[emacs]: i3? bspwm?
[16:17:14] <tcsilver> :----D
[16:17:26] <Urchin[emacs]> Satin: ratpoison
[16:17:29] <MootPoot> what I'm saying is that linux has bad user flow 
[16:17:33] <Satin> Urchin[emacs]: does it use lua or?
[16:17:39] <MootPoot> and the answer to it is 'git gud'
[16:18:23] <MootPoot> even if say I had a technical tool - like for example my oscilloscope on my desk
[16:18:26] <Urchin[emacs]> Satin: it's a C program with a sort of a repl that does some basic things, it can really be scripted by anything, really, but I haven't dwelled on it
[16:18:54] <Urchin[emacs]> Satin: there's an almost-reimplementation of it done in Common Lisp, called StumpWM
[16:19:05] <Satin> MootPoot: I'm not sure I agree to that. In my opinion some of those things make Linux have some degree of advantage over Windows in the amount of control you have over your system. 
[16:19:39] <MootPoot> if the manufacturer told me "oh yeah to do a basic thing like read voltage you gotta take it apart with a screwdriver and hot-wire these two terminals on the mainboard" , even though it is a techincal thing and there is a expectation of technicall knowlege while using it, I would STILL say that the osilloscope has bad user flow
[16:19:41] <Satin> Simple things like adding another source to your package manager's lists can be annoying I suppose once in a while, but it's not really a big deal? Windows users do random shit to make things work for certain games all the time and such too.
[16:19:57] <Satin> It genuinely feels like you're exaggerating that a lot more than most would.
[16:20:15] <MootPoot> of course, its because your normalized to it , so you dont see it as a bad user flow
[16:20:18] <Satin> On the other hand, you might have had other experiences that make linux annoying, and I myself have had bad driver issues with graphics and such in years prior.
[16:20:40] <davic> why do I have a bad feeling about playing cards against humanity with the company
[16:20:43] <Satin> Urchin[emacs]: lol wild
[16:20:55] <Sadale> nya~ :3
[16:21:03] <MootPoot> if a linux user had to install a basic tool on windows and they were told to go into the registry and edit a few keys, I would also call that bad user flow
[16:21:24] <Sadale> windows registry sucks

[16:23:40] <Satin> Urchin[emacs]: i see
[16:23:41] <Urchin[emacs]> Satin: IIRC, the backstory of it was that someone was using and reprogramming a keyboard run window manager written in Scheme while high on weed and posted to a ... some group on internet, and got people on board with making a window manager that lisp/emacs people can use while high on weed
[16:23:41] <Urchin[emacs]> side note: I'm not high on weed
[16:23:56] <Satin> this conversation makes me think there needs to be a distro incredibly catered to being user friendly that we can point to
[16:24:06] <MootPoot> Satin: you see, I dont complain in windows or mac or whatever when you have to do that for some kind of specialized dev tool or something , since thats a higher level of user skill you assume

[16:29:25] <Satin> MootPoot: i don't disagree with you that linux has "usability" issues or anything, but i'm very much bothered by how editing a sources file is somehow so un-user friendly or such a big hindenrece to user flow
[16:29:43] <Sadale> Linux isn't like Windowss. For Windows, if it spreads, it's bring in profit for microsoft. For linux, it doesn't mean much to spread, really. Anyway it's more realiable than Windows so it's by far the most popular OS for servers.
[16:30:00] <Sadale> And it's quiet efficient.
[16:30:01] *** Joins: Mr_Miser1 (~weechat@27.34.108.134)
[16:30:17] <MootPoot> Satin: the issue is your POV is "linux as a tool for compter people" and thats it
[16:30:19] <Satin> i want more OS choices to be very clear, i don't think linux is even that great, it's just better in some ways than windows often and i want and wish for it to be judged and criticized more friiendly than this level of criticiism
[16:30:50] <MootPoot> my POV is "its possible for linux to be an everyman OS and this kind of shit is stopping it"
[16:30:52] <Sadale> I'd say MootPoot has come ot the wrong place to criticize about linux. This channel has too many linux users :P
[16:31:07] <MootPoot> so when you say editing a source file is easy
[16:31:13] <Satin> it is
[16:31:17] <MootPoot> it comes from a position of like...idk ablism?
[16:31:19] <Satin> it's a text file and you're copy/pasting it
[16:31:27] <Sadale> Are you talking about the repo source file tho?
[16:31:27] <Satin> why would you want that to be hidden
[16:31:33] <Satin> Sadale: yes
[16:31:36] <MootPoot> do you expect a 85 year old granny whos never used a computer before to be able to do that?
[16:31:40] <Sadale> Satin, Why do you even need to edit that? :o Upgrade?
[16:31:52] <MootPoot> what about a 5 year old who just wants to play fortnite or soemthing
[16:31:54] <Satin> Sadale: he was trying to install teamviewer and it was not avialable in the mainstream repo
[16:32:04] <Sadale> Satin, oh. That's why
[16:32:12] <MootPoot> what about the plumber who just wants to make 3d models and dosent care or know about anything underlying
[16:32:13] <Satin> Sadale: yes. 90% of the time it's available in the main repo
[16:32:33] <Satin> but he was trying to do this one thing that wasn't in the mainstream repo, and then just.... got so annoyed by it and thinks it's un-user friendly now because of it
[16:32:34] <Sadale> MootPoot, the thing is, by editing the source file, you can update teamviewer along with all other packages in one go. That's something that couldn't be done on Windows
[16:32:43] <Satin> Sadale: it doesn't feel fair.
[16:32:44] <Sadale> On Windows you'd have to update the software individually
[16:32:52] <Sadale> Plus who even care about teamviewer in linux? :P
[16:32:59] <MootPoot> Sadale: chocolatey is a thing
[16:33:32] <Satin> you can have a kid play games on linux without using the terminal for the most part in 2021
[16:33:37] <MootPoot> but for the 3 people I give examples of above
[16:33:49] <Satin> the 85 year old granny would be able to process the repos part tbh
[16:33:53] <Sadale> Satin, It's kind of interesting to see that linux binary often won't work on all linux machines. It has to be built for a specific distro :/
[16:34:06] <Satin> same level as "don't download software from stupid sites"
[16:34:09] <MootPoot> I guess its not really a releavant criticm for you since your POV of linux is different

[16:35:32] <Sadale> And I don't think being mainstream is a goal of linux at all
[16:35:36] <Satin> microsoft is extinghuising linux already
[16:35:44] <Satin> co-opitng open source and linux
[16:35:49] <Sadale> linux subsystem for windows :/
[16:35:51] <Satin> all the values and what not are thrown under the bus
[16:36:07] <Sadale> Anyway I think the server market for linux is here to stay
[16:36:07] <Satin> imagine if many years ago the open source community that contributed to linux
[16:36:10] <Satin> would one day wake up 
[16:36:13] <Satin> to their code and work
[16:36:19] <Satin> being used and ending up in fucking microsoft windows
[16:36:24] <Satin> with intrusive anti-user freedom features
[16:36:28] <Satin> what a tragedy
[16:36:33] <MootPoot> why can't it be an everyman OS?
[16:36:39] <Satin> wow i'm actually feeling angry for once in 20000 years
[16:36:41] <MootPoot> linux is supposed to be about freedom or something right?
[16:36:50] <Satin> but  i think it's also because my friend i'm listening to in discord vc is getting mad at a game
[16:36:54] <Satin> so it's leaking over to me
[16:36:54] <Sadale> MootPoot, First you need the users. Windows ain't perfect. But it has got shitton of users.
[16:36:55] <Satin> lol
[16:36:58] <MootPoot> how does that work when freedom is confined to only the people who know how
[16:37:13] <Satin> it's not 'freedom or something'
[16:37:20] <Satin> Sadale: he doesn't even know who stallman is i bet
[16:37:32] <Sadale> MootPoot, Windows has shit that's difficult to deal with like windows upgrade failure. I still haven't managed to fix that for my imouto's machine.
[16:37:45] <MootPoot> Sadale: I agree - but those users are being kept on windows since issues like this are keeping them away - they look to change , and see no options other then a mac
[16:37:46] <Sadale> It has been going on for weeks for my imouto's machine.

[16:38:15] <tcsilver> hmmm....
[16:38:21] <Sadale> MootPoot, And for linux, let's be real. Most users are experienced and they don't care about making everything pointy-clicky. :P
[16:38:41] <Sadale> MootPoot, so the new users either have to learn all that, or just use Windows and be happy
[16:38:52] <tcsilver> what does the word imouto mean ? i use the bot but don't know.
[16:39:06] <MootPoot> Sadale: and this is the reason why the year of the linux desktop will never come
[16:39:09] <Sadale> user experience isn't the priority for most FOSS projects, really.
[16:39:16] <Satin> year of the linux desktop is memez
[16:39:18] <Sadale> MootPoot, Does that even matter huh?
[16:39:27] <Satin> MootPoot: ever heard of https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/philosophy.html
[16:39:28] <ImoutoBot> [title] Philosophy of the GNU Project - GNU Project - Free Software Foundation
[16:39:32] <Sadale> MootPoot, I mean if you want you could make a distro that's beginner-friendly.
[16:39:39] <MootPoot> and we'll keep on getting people like auora unironically posting about how somehow FOSS will eventually take over the world
[16:39:42] <Satin> Sadale: that's what i was thinking
[16:39:50] <Satin> Sadale: elementryOS? ig that's dead
[16:39:56] <Satin> Linux Mint exists but i bet pooters already looked into that
[16:40:00] <Sadale> Satin, I dunno. I don't care.
[16:40:08] <Satin> neither does urichin
[16:40:13] <Satin> i see a pattern here
[16:40:16] <Sadale> What matter is that I'm used to using linux. So I'll be keep using that.
[16:40:27] <Satin> honest and to the point like always sad ale

[16:41:10] *** Quits: Chuck_Norris (~irc@user/pronhub) (Quit: Chuck_Norris)
[16:41:18] <MootPoot> meh
[16:41:45] <MootPoot> seems like everyone in the desktop OS space wants nothing more then their own walled garden
[16:41:58] <Satin> it's funny now that i think about it
[16:42:08] <MootPoot> some want it in mindset, some want it in software, some want it in both
[16:42:10] <Satin> even tho i disagree with pooters here, i was saying similiar things about IRC users a year or two ago
[16:42:17] <Satin> cuz i want IRC to compete with discord 
[16:42:22] <Satin> but a lot of people just want to hold onto irc as it is
[16:42:27] <Satin> cringe boomers smh
[16:42:37] <MootPoot> I have that viewpoint as well
[16:42:44] <MootPoot> with IRC and discord
[16:42:44] <Satin> mine or theirs
[16:42:55] <MootPoot> there is a really weird obsession about not letting things change
[16:43:10] <Satin> MootPoot: there are some valid reasons for that here and there
[16:43:32] <tcsilver> I'll go have some ricewall soup
[16:43:35] <Satin> for example, the IRC protocol is so cool and simple and reliable, and the logentitivyty is so evident of that as well
[16:43:43] <Sadale> I acutually like IRC as it is right now. Less users means less discord idiots. :P
[16:43:46] <Satin> the second you add stuff onto that
[16:44:00] <Satin> and add complexity, and tchnical complexity i see why some people want it to be barebones simple right
[16:44:05] <MootPoot> Sadale: half the people here that are regulars also use discord lol
[16:44:08] <Sadale> Less idiots means more decent people. Yes. The number of IRC users is far less than discord. But I enjoy using IRC far more than discord
[16:44:30] <Sadale> MootPoot, some people here just use discord because they have to. Just like me.
[16:44:33] <Satin> another reason i can think of is
[16:44:36] <Sadale> MootPoot, some people don't care tho.
[16:44:40] <Satin> not wanting to be entangled with one centralized company etc
[16:44:42] <MootPoot> Sadale: so you're a discord idiot as well?
[16:44:47] <Sadale> MootPoot, ouch xD
[16:45:01] <Satin> MootPoot: he's forced to use discord
[16:45:03] <Satin> that doesn't count
[16:45:15] <Satin> but what i'm saying is, look at the cost of coming up with conveninet features
[16:45:16] <MootPoot> why
[16:45:17] <Sadale> MootPoot, I'm not because I called out those idiots first. So everyone uses discord except me are idiots :P
[16:45:25] <MootPoot> nobody put a gun to his head and made him use it
[16:45:29] <Satin> they did
[16:45:31] <MootPoot> he can just not
[16:45:34] <Satin> they did
[16:45:35] <MootPoot> really 
[16:45:39] <Satin> he's forced to use discord by other people
[16:45:39] <Satin> yes
[16:45:44] <Sadale> they didn't put a gun to my head. But I have to use it or I can't contact those people :/
[16:45:48] <Satin> ^
[16:45:49] <MootPoot> then dont :{
[16:45:52] <MootPoot> lmao

[16:46:41] <Sadale> I don't install discord on my daily driver linux tho.
[16:46:52] <Sadale> I either use it in a browser or on my windows installation.
[16:46:54] <Satin> as much as i want irc to change i wonder how you can even introduce more conveninet features
[16:46:58] <Satin> what cost it comes at
[16:46:59] <MootPoot> Sadale: you said this a few min ago
[16:47:12] <MootPoot> 6:08:41 AM <Sadale> MootPoot, so the new users either have to learn all that, or just use Windows and be happy
[16:47:15] <MootPoot> In other words
[16:47:16] <MootPoot> suck it up
[16:47:21] <MootPoot> and deal with the crap
[16:47:25] <Satin> 6 am

[16:47:45] <MootPoot> and my point is Sadale its bad, and you shouldnt have to deal with the crap

[16:48:40] <Sadale> MootPoot, I mean you either take it or leave it. Fortunately for linux tho, it's FOSS so it's possible for you to make your own distro. For Windows tho, you can't quite mod it.

[16:49:13] <MootPoot> Sadale: I know you can, but again - you shouldnt have to if you dont want to, so you can do the stuff you want

[17:29:04] <omero> on humans its harmful 
[17:29:42] <Sadale> ow
[17:29:50] <omero> in the army/navy was common practice... but long term firm (the period of service)... its very harmful
[17:30:35] <omero> it means... even if the dose is kept on a minimum, on the prolongued period its inevitably harmful
[17:31:19] <omero> it wasnt intended for 'preventing libido' alone... actually the intention was to have the personnel 'keep their cool'
[17:31:40] <Sadale> aw
[17:31:51] <omero> I mean... it wasnt intended to prevent one to 'keep it in their pants'
[17:32:01] <omero> no the reverse

[18:21:10] <Berlin36> i can choose between the two, the first one is cheaper, but idk about performance
[18:22:11] <Berlin36> and on the first one i can't extend ram (8gb default and max), the second, has 8gb default ram and can be extended till 16

[18:26:12] <Berlin36> ?
[18:26:21] <MootPoot> Go for the 16
[18:26:26] <Berlin36> aight
[18:26:28] <MootPoot> 8 is not enough
[18:26:37] <MootPoot> You'll start being annoyed pretty quick 
[18:26:41] <Berlin36> how much does 8gb of ram cost?
[18:26:42] <Berlin36> dude
[18:26:45] <Berlin36> im using a 2gb ram laptop
[18:26:53] <MootPoot> Sad
[18:26:55] <Berlin36> ye
[18:26:56] <Berlin36> well idk
[18:27:01] <MootPoot> 8gb should be like 40 bucks or something
[18:27:08] <MootPoot> Even less soon now that ddr5 is here 
[18:27:17] <Berlin36> im also running i3 with arch, so it's okay for basic browsing and stuff
[18:27:28] <MootPoot> But anyway for any actual work it's best to get 16
[18:27:36] <Berlin36> alright
[18:27:37] <Berlin36> but
[18:27:46] <Berlin36> do the processors have some significant difference?
[18:28:02] <Berlin36> i searched online, many sites say the 4300u is better
[18:28:36] <Berlin36> but the laptop with that processor doesn't have extendable ram
[18:28:58] <MootPoot> Yeah it is better, but the problem is if you intend to do dev work 
[18:29:09] <MootPoot> It's. Better for longevity 
[18:29:16] <Berlin36> how is that
[18:29:32] <MootPoot> Once you start running a bunch of dev tools and your own crap 
[18:29:33] <Berlin36> also the one with the 4300u has 256gb ssd compared to 512 that the second has
[18:29:37] <MootPoot> It'll creep up 
[18:30:14] <MootPoot> Like a proper IDE will use a few GB of RAM 
[18:30:17] <MootPoot> Then a browser
[18:30:21] <Berlin36> the second one is like 100 bucks more expensiev
[18:30:22] <MootPoot> Then a server maybe 
[18:30:23] <MootPoot> Etc
[18:30:46] <Berlin36> i don't really use an ide at the moment, im coding in sublime text
[18:31:01] <Berlin36> and running from console
[18:31:56] <MootPoot> Yes, but that's at the moment 
[18:32:05] <MootPoot> What about 3 years later? 
[18:32:08] <Berlin36> welp
[18:32:15] <Berlin36> i don't wanna buy it 3 years later
[18:32:21] <MootPoot> No I mean 
[18:32:29] <Berlin36> oooh
[18:32:30] <MootPoot> What if you're using an IDE 3 years later 
[18:32:34] <MootPoot> Then what?
[18:32:36] <Berlin36> then 
[18:32:37] <Berlin36> then idk
[18:32:47] <Berlin36> why should i use an ide?
[18:32:53] <Sadale> nya~ :3
[18:32:59] <Berlin36> idk what it is useful for
[18:33:03] <Berlin36> yo Sadale 
[18:33:08] <MootPoot> Easier, extra tools  , larger projects 
[18:33:10] <MootPoot> Etc etc
[18:33:11] <Sadale> just use whatever floats your boat
[18:33:29] <Sadale> If a text editor works for you, use a text editor. If an IDE works for you, ues an IDE
[18:33:38] <MootPoot> True but it'll be never too keep your option open 
[18:33:57] <Berlin36> aight
[18:34:17] <MootPoot> A slightly slower cpu won't inhibit you as much as not enough ram will 
[18:34:30] <MootPoot> Slower cpu- stuff will take longer 
[18:34:41] <MootPoot> Not enough ram - stuff will start to crash 
[18:34:43] <Sadale> not enough RAM - use swap :P
[18:34:56] <MootPoot> ugh
[18:34:58] <MootPoot> swap
[18:35:05] <Sadale> Use your HDD/SSD as RAM. Now the problem becomes "stuffs will take longer" :P
[18:35:10] <Sadale> take much longer tho xD
[18:35:15] <MootPoot> or the system just crashes
[18:35:19] <MootPoot> since it cant accomodate it
[18:35:20] <MootPoot> lol
[18:35:28] <MootPoot> application*
[18:35:28] <Berlin36> im using linux for nearly a year
[18:35:31] <Sadale> MootPoot, On linux tho you can totally use swap. The program won't crash
[18:35:31] <Berlin36> and idk what swap is
[18:35:44] <Sadale> swap is like using your HDD space as RAM
[18:35:45] <MootPoot> Sadale: program dependant
[18:35:53] <Berlin36> oh
[18:35:59] <MootPoot> some on linux just lose their mind
[18:36:06] <Berlin36> does that work ?
[18:36:10] <Sadale> Windows: yes. linux: nope. It'd just get dog slow at worst :P
[18:36:17] <MootPoot> yes but its very slow 
[18:36:18] <MootPoot> and shit
[18:36:20] <Sadale> indeed xD
[18:36:20] <Berlin36> oh
[18:36:22] <Berlin36> right
[18:36:22] <MootPoot> like snail slow
[18:36:32] <MootPoot> like "I can barely work on this computer " slow
[18:36:35] <Berlin36> if it's an ssd then it'll be faster?
[18:36:37] <Sadale> MootPoot, I agree
[18:36:48] <Sadale> Berlin36, yep. much faster than HDD swap. But still very slow.
[18:36:53] <Berlin36> aight
[18:36:53] <MootPoot> Berlin36: yes but not enough - it'll still be a piece of shit
[18:37:01] <Berlin36> okaay
[18:38:11] <MootPoot> If you already had 16gb of ram and were arguing 16 vs 32, then I would probably tell you better cpu
[18:38:16] <MootPoot> but 8 is really low 
[18:38:23] <Sadale> huh?
[18:38:24] <Sadale> 8 isn't that bad
[18:38:43] <Sadale> If you don't game much it's ok. My imouto has been using 8GB and it works mostly fine.

[18:38:56] <MootPoot> mostly?
[18:39:05] <Sadale> except for minecraft.
[18:39:19] <Sadale> running minecraft and firefox at the same time would sometimes cause minecraft to crash
[18:39:28] <Berlin36> it 15.6 TN FHD, 8gb ram, 512ssd, ryzen5 3500U, radeon8vega 
[18:39:31] <Sadale> so she had to close firefox while playing minecraft
[18:39:43] <Berlin36> nah, i don't game at all
[18:39:57] <Berlin36> might enter minecraft once in two months, but i doubt that's gaming
[18:40:02] <Sadale> lol the asus logo looks like Arch linux
[18:40:04] <MootPoot> imo 
[18:40:11] <MootPoot> if you really want to go barebones
[18:40:15] <Berlin36> lol it does, Sadale 
[18:40:16] <MootPoot> and minmalist
[18:40:26] <MootPoot> just go get a 8gb rpi or something
[18:40:34] <Berlin36> lol
[18:40:43] <Sadale> rpi's overpriced
[18:40:46] <Sadale> and slow
[18:40:47] <Berlin36> mining bitcoin on rpi lesgoooo
[18:40:55] <Berlin36> yeah it's expensive as fucc
[18:41:09] <Berlin36> but i think it's a good tool for learning stuff
[18:41:14] <Sadale> At the price point of 8gb pi there's plenty of alternatives if you don't care about the power usage
[18:41:14] <MootPoot> Sadale: compared to?
[18:41:29] <Sadale> MootPoot, ITX/mATX mobo with embedded CPU
[18:41:34] <Berlin36> i also want to code with arduino
[18:41:39] <Berlin36> doing some interesting stuff
[18:41:42] <Sadale> MootPoot, or even smartphone of the same price
[18:41:56] <Sadale> MootPoot, or used computer
[18:41:57] <Berlin36> i want to make a rubber ducky from an arduino
[18:42:06] <MootPoot> Sadale: the itx mobo is at least like 300-400
[18:42:12] <Sadale> Berlin36, don't worry about programming on laptop. Even a low-end laptop would do
[18:42:12] <MootPoot> yeah its a lot faster
[18:42:15] <MootPoot> but its 4x the price
[18:42:24] <MootPoot> used pc..maybe
[18:42:26] <Sadale> Berlin36, as long as you aren't programming elephants like firefox, you should be fine.
[18:42:38] <Berlin36> yeah that's what i was thinking too
[18:42:49] <Berlin36> and now im still a beginner
[18:42:52] <Berlin36> i don't do crazy stuff
[18:42:54] <Sadale> MootPoot, for ITX/mATX mobo, that's not true. Some of them are even cheaper than rpi.
[18:43:02] <MootPoot> Sadale: show me one
[18:43:04] <Sadale> MootPoot, it eats more power tho.
[18:43:16] <Berlin36> i've seen a banana pi 
[18:43:21] <Berlin36> or ssomething simillar
[18:43:26] <MootPoot> every one I know is at least 300
[18:43:32] <Berlin36> it had 16gb on board + a sd card slot
[18:43:36] <Berlin36> and was generally cheaper

[18:45:31] <Sadale> MootPoot, ah. right. PSU ain't free either.
[18:45:37] <Sadale> MootPoot, I could get one for like $15 tho.
[18:45:41] <Sadale> the cheapest one.
[18:45:56] <Sadale> or I could just salvage one from one of my old computers
[18:46:21] <HeTo> the problem with the cheapest one is that you’ll have to buy a new motherboard when the PSU fries it
[18:46:27] <MootPoot> lol
[18:47:07] <Sadale> And here's another problem. RPI is far more efficient compared with these mobos, especially if you're using PSU that's meant for full-ledge PC. They takes like 20W even at idle.
[18:47:11] *** Quits: hans (~hans@81.166.125.50.static.multigamer.no) (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[18:47:18] <Sadale> maybe even 30~40W.
[18:47:25] <MootPoot> Berlin36: anyway, do whatever you want - I would personally think the one with a 16gb option or a different computer with the 4300+16gb would be the best option if you can find it
[18:47:43] <MootPoot> it leaves you the most doors open in the future
[18:47:48] <MootPoot> for what you want to do
[18:47:54] <Sadale> He could just get a RAM upgrade
[18:48:03] <MootPoot> the 8gb one has no upgrade
[18:48:05] <Berlin36> okay MootPoot 
[18:48:05] <MootPoot> its fixed
[18:48:19] <Sadale> oh really?
[18:48:21] <Sadale> That sucks
[18:48:23] <MootPoot> the other one has the option to expand to 16 if he wants
[18:48:23] <Berlin36> yeah
[18:48:30] <Sadale> I don't like modern laptop that doesn't allow upgrade: /
[18:48:36] <Berlin36> and has 256 more gb of ssd
[18:48:39] <MootPoot> Sadale: yeah if that wasent the case I would have told him to get the faster cpu

[18:49:18] <Sadale> as of today tho 8gb is kind of enough as long as you aren't a power user or a heavy gamer. :P
[18:49:21] <Sadale> Can't tell for future
[18:49:33] <Sadale> programs are getting more and more RAM-hungry :-(
[18:49:35] <MootPoot> keep your options open
[18:49:46] <Sadale> keep your ass open :P
[18:49:57] <MootPoot> easier to spend 100 more now rather then have to buy a whole new laptop in 3 years
[18:50:07] <Sadale> hmm...
[18:50:44] <Berlin36> gaming on a laptop is cancer
[18:50:56] <MootPoot> its not really just gaming though 
[18:51:02] <Berlin36> why not buy a decent pc than spending way more on a good laptop
[18:51:02] <MootPoot> I mean sure they use a lot
[18:51:16] <Sadale> I miss the day of 32bit era. programs were less RAM hungry back then
[18:51:21] <MootPoot> idk you're the one who broguht up the laptop
[18:51:24] <Sadale> Using 64bit takes 1.5x of RAM :<
[18:51:37] <MootPoot> if you want a PC then use a PC
[18:51:53] <Sadale> Berlin36, PC is cheaper indeed. It's more power hungry tho. And energy ain't free.
[18:52:04] <Berlin36> oh yeah, energy
[18:52:11] <Sadale> Berlin36, anyway I don't think the saved money on energy usage for laptop would pay off.
[18:52:28] <Berlin36> it depends on what you're doing
[18:52:41] <MootPoot> ok
[18:52:42] <MootPoot> work time
[18:52:43] <Berlin36> if you're mining then of course you'll spend more on energy

[18:53:00] <Sadale> true. The main problem is that an idle PC PSU takes 20-30W. Idle laptop takes far less than that,.
[18:53:03] <Berlin36> do people mine on laptops? i feel like they'll just burn
[18:53:15] <Sadale> I wouldn't recommend that
[18:53:27] <Sadale> doubt that it'd even be profitable to do that
[18:53:32] <Berlin36> yeah, i wouldn't do that to my laptop
[18:54:23] <Berlin36> how much does a laptop consume when in sleep mode?
[18:56:21] <Sadale> checking
[18:57:14] <Sadale> Berlin36, 10W for the low-end laptop that I have. 15W when CPU is at max.
[18:57:41] <Sadale> Berlin36, For reference, my current desktop is 38W idle, 121W max CPU, 138W max CPU+iGPU.
[18:57:47] <Berlin36> oh wow
[18:57:51] <Berlin36> that's a lot
[18:57:56] <Sadale> I should have purchased a better PSU.
[18:58:04] <Berlin36> psu is power supply?
[18:58:05] <Sadale> I just cheaped out on the PSU. Now that I regret it.
[18:58:07] <Sadale> yep
[18:58:12] <Berlin36> oh
[18:58:31] <Berlin36> are 15'6" laptops portable?
[18:58:47] <Sadale> the only way to know is to buy it and actually use it :P
[18:58:53] <Berlin36> yeah you're right
[18:59:01] <Sadale> My desktop is kind of portable tho. Kind of. I could put it into a bag.
[18:59:08] <Berlin36> the most im worried about the battery
[18:59:12] <Sadale> here's my current "desktop": https://secret.sadale.net/imeig/superlaptop.png :P
[18:59:12] <Berlin36> idk how much it will last
[18:59:13] <ImoutoBot> [image/png] 960kB
[18:59:23] <Berlin36> but a lot of laptops have a dead battery after a year or tw
[18:59:31] <Sadale> Berlin36, oh. don't believe in the specs for battery. When it ages, the battery life can drop a lot.
[18:59:35] <Berlin36> well older laptops at least
[18:59:37] <Sadale> exactly.
[18:59:43] <Berlin36> :(
[18:59:58] *** Joins: aHick (~memes@143.60.228.11)
[19:00:20] <Sadale> no idea on if the more expensive one would be any better. what I could tell you is that for that old laptop i've got, the battery life had dropped from 8hr to like 1.5hr.
[19:00:30] <Sadale> over the course of like, maybe 10 years?
[19:00:33] <Sadale> maybe 5 years?
[19:00:38] <Sadale> closer to 5 years I think
[19:00:55] <Berlin36> 8 hours, that's a lot
[19:00:59] <ImoutoBot> New episode for: Sugar Bunnies | Episode: 18
[19:01:13] <Berlin36> the battery life of my current laptop is like 0.5 seconds
[19:01:24] <Sadale> xD
[19:01:26] <Berlin36> ye
[19:01:33] <Sadale> I see. That's what you call a dead battery
[19:01:47] <Berlin36> yup
[19:01:57] <Sadale> I said 1.5hr now tho. No longer 8hr.
[19:02:01] <Berlin36> completely dead lol
[19:02:02] <Sadale> 8hr was the original one.
[19:02:05] <Sadale> 1.5hr is now
[19:02:11] <Berlin36> it seems alright
[19:02:37] <Sadale> meh. It'd just be a matter of time for the battery to die
[19:02:48] <Sadale> Not sure on if that'd be the case for higher end laptop tho
[19:03:05] <Berlin36> that asus is 622 usd
[19:03:28] <Sadale> I know. That ain't a low-end laptop.
[19:03:33] <Berlin36> oh
[19:03:35] <Sadale> So I can't tell. I've never purchased a mid-end laptop
[19:03:50] <Sadale> huh? I suppose that's mid-end, isn't it? :O
[19:03:56] <Berlin36> idk 
[19:04:00] <Berlin36> never heard those terms
[19:04:17] <Berlin36> im using my mother's old laptop from around 2013 
[19:04:18] <Sadale> at least that isn't the cheapest one you could get. That's one of the cheaper ones tho
[19:04:36] <Sadale> aw your mom's able to operate laptop.
[19:04:42] <Berlin36> yeah, there are much more expensive ones, but i can't afford them
[19:04:42] <Sadale> My mom's dumb af xD
[19:04:49] <Berlin36> don't say that :D
[19:04:55] <Sadale> dumber than yours
[19:05:03] <Berlin36> well yeah, my mom bought recently a new laptop
[19:05:31] <Berlin36> i believe it has a ryzen 3 
[19:05:43] <Berlin36> and holy fuck, ssd are fast
[19:05:52] <Sadale> it is :3
[19:05:56] <Berlin36> it boots windows 10 in like 4 seconds
[19:06:00] <Sadale> wow
[19:06:02] <Sadale> That's indeed fast
[19:06:13] <Sadale> ah that's because it's a laptop and it never actually shuts down.
[19:06:14] <Berlin36> aight might be a lil bit more, like 10 sec or so
[19:06:17] <Sadale> It has fastboot enabled.
[19:06:52] <Berlin36> i hope my arch linux will boot in 1 second on ssd
[19:06:54] <Sadale> lol just take her new laptop :P
[19:07:00] <Berlin36> xdd
[19:07:46] <Berlin36> it hurts me to see her working on windows 10 on a shitty 4gb lenovo with a shitty intel processor on a hd screen
[19:07:54] <Sadale> aw :(
[19:08:00] <Sadale> By HD did you mean 720p?
[19:08:17] <Sadale> to be precise 1366x768
[19:08:24] <Berlin36> it's  ~1300x900
[19:08:26] <Berlin36> yeah
[19:08:26] <Sadale> ah
[19:08:27] <Berlin36> that
[19:08:36] <Sadale> This one's common for lower-end laptop
[19:08:43] <Berlin36> yeah, mine is like that now
[19:08:53] <Berlin36> i can see the pixels .-.
[19:08:58] <Sadale> wow
[19:08:59] <Sadale> That's bad
[19:09:10] <Berlin36> well if im close to it of course
[19:09:16] <Sadale> My old laptop's 11.6" so I can't really see the pixels
[19:09:23] <Sadale> Maybe I just didn't observe close enough
[19:09:27] <Berlin36> oh yeah, this one is 15.6 
[19:09:34] <Berlin36> so i can see pixels from like 10 cm
[19:09:38] <Sadale> ah
[19:09:53] <Sadale> My new desktop has a monitor of 15". But it's 1920x1080. I like it :3
[19:10:00] <Sadale> maybe 15.6". I couldn't remember
[19:10:03] <Berlin36> oh nice
[19:10:18] <Berlin36> it's annoying writing code on a HD screen
[19:10:31] <Berlin36> because you can't really use little font
[19:10:34] <Sadale> ouch xD
[19:10:36] <Berlin36> yee
[19:11:01] <Berlin36> im glad at least that i use linux
[19:11:19] <Sadale> me too. Just wondering, why are you using linux? What do you like it about? :3
[19:11:19] <Berlin36> it uses like 300mb of ram lol
[19:11:24] *** Joins: duds- (~duds-@gateway/tor-sasl/duds)
[19:11:26] <Sadale> ah. saves RAM :3
[19:11:29] <Berlin36> and it's super easy to use 
[19:11:36] <Sadale> MootPoot doesn't agree on this one :P
[19:11:41] <Berlin36> and also you can do basically everythin with it
[19:11:43] <Sadale> To me tho it's easy enough :3
[19:11:46] <Berlin36> ye
[19:11:59] <Berlin36> i don't like that there are some struggles with drivers and stuff
[19:12:04] <MootPoot> what
[19:12:10] <MootPoot> I do agreee Sadale 
[19:12:21] <MootPoot> if you dont have enough ram then use what works
[19:12:22] <Berlin36> like for a printer, you need to search 2193913 hours on how to properly config something
[19:12:27] <Sadale> MootPoot, "linux is super easy to use"
[19:12:32] <MootPoot> oh that part
[19:12:37] <Berlin36> but i think ill still use i3 with arch on that laptop
[19:12:43] <Sadale> nice :3
[19:12:46] <Berlin36> i3 is really comfortable imo
[19:12:53] <Sadale> I can't use i3 tho xD
[19:12:56] <MootPoot> yeah I dont agree on that - "super easy" is only easy for computer people
[19:12:57] <Sadale> Too lazy to learn
[19:13:02] <Berlin36> it took me a few days 
[19:13:12] <Sadale> ah. you student?
[19:13:13] <Berlin36> now im navigating through i3 like a madman
[19:13:42] <Sadale> I used to be able to learn quick back when I was a student. I had more energy and time. :3
[19:13:46] <Berlin36> im a student
[19:13:51] <Berlin36> well im in highschool now
[19:13:53] <Sadale> Now I've got stupid work draining my energy :<
[19:14:14] <Sadale> Hope that I could amass enough money to retire soon.
[19:14:27] <Berlin36> retire soon?
[19:14:32] <Berlin36> how old are you Sadale 
[19:14:41] <Sadale> Berlin36, in 20s. I hope to retire at 40.
[19:14:50] <Berlin36> oh
[19:14:51] <Sadale> That's what I'm aiming at right now
[19:15:13] <Sadale> stupid capitalistic world :P
[19:15:24] <MootPoot> well
[19:15:32] <MootPoot> at least you can retire in capitalism
[19:15:41] <Sadale> lol bullshit xD
[19:15:47] * Sadale spits at MootPoot xD
[19:15:52] <MootPoot> rather then having to die when you hit 35
[19:15:57] <MootPoot> from being bitten by a snake
[19:15:59] <MootPoot> in the fields
[19:16:03] <Berlin36> i don't even know what capitalism is
[19:16:18] <MootPoot> or working for lord your entire life
[19:16:21] <MootPoot> lol
[19:16:36] <Berlin36> was never actually interested in it and why do people hate it so much
[19:16:44] <MootPoot> Berlin36: capital = money = capitalism - the use and gain/loss of money 
[19:16:48] <Sadale> MootPoot, So here's how I'd choose if I had a choice: no work > work til 40 > death at 35 by snake > work til 60
[19:17:08] <MootPoot> if anything you are partificpating in capitalism Sadale 
[19:17:13] <Berlin36> death at 35 by snake
[19:17:17] <Sadale> Berlin36, I'm just partially shitposting. I just love to joke about how evil capitalism is :P
[19:17:18] <MootPoot> by by being able to retire early
[19:17:40] <Berlin36> people work till ~60 in my country until they can retire
[19:17:40] <MootPoot> in other systems you would have to work nonstop till you were  unable
[19:17:51] <Berlin36> i believe policemen can retire in their 40's
[19:17:54] <Sadale> Berlin36, maybe you'd get how fucked up this system is once you start working.
[19:18:21] <Sadale> Berlin36, capitalism rewards the greeds. It doesn't reward the competent people.\
[19:18:29] <Berlin36> yeahh, i wouldn't really want to work for someone earning little money
[19:18:43] <Berlin36> idk what to do about that at the moment, but i want to do big things in life
[19:19:42] <MootPoot> it rewards competency more then most other systems
[19:19:55] <MootPoot> although not perfectly
[19:20:08] <MootPoot> and there is  abias toward those who have more money to start with
[19:20:16] <Sadale> it rewards competency of being greedy :/
[19:20:23] <MootPoot> so?
[19:20:24] <Sadale> not competency of getting shit done
[19:20:38] <MootPoot> pure greed gets you nowheer

[19:21:00] <Sadale> with right connections tho, it'll get you to somewhere
[19:21:27] <MootPoot> how do you get those connections?
[19:21:33] <Sadale> oh and this too. connection plays a very important role in this capitalism world.
[19:21:37] <MootPoot> social and business competency
[19:21:45] <Sadale> luck or parents.
[19:21:52] <Berlin36> the world i live in might not be the best, but at least im grateful i don't live in north coreea or other such countries lmao
[19:21:59] <Sadale> luck is the most important part tho
[19:22:03] <MootPoot> yes and no - parents may help you get your foot in the door
[19:22:15] <MootPoot> but its your own skill which lets you exploit that connection
[19:22:19] <MootPoot> and gain for it
[19:22:24] <Sadale> hmm
[19:22:42] <MootPoot> even if you were bill gates son, if all you did was throw poo at the connections that your dad gave you
[19:22:48] <MootPoot> those connections would do nothing
[19:22:57] <Berlin36> yeah
[19:23:03] <Sadale> MootPoot, If I were bill gate's son I wouldn't work at all xD
[19:23:20] <Sadale> I'd be swiming in money without needing to work at all.
[19:23:22] <MootPoot> you know bill gates hasent given any of his kids any money
[19:23:27] <MootPoot> at all
[19:23:28] <Berlin36> if i were bill gates son i'd be ashamed if i were to have a lot of things only because of him
[19:23:28] <MootPoot> lol
[19:23:31] <MootPoot> beyond their education
[19:23:35] <Berlin36> well that's how i think at the moment
[19:23:51] <Sadale> MootPoot, technically speaking, maybe that's true. In practice, I'm sure that they're receiving the money in some way.
[19:23:54] <MootPoot> Berlin36: are you ashamed of being able to eat and sleep and sit on IRC ?
[19:24:17] <Berlin36> no
[19:24:18] <MootPoot> your parents gave you those unearned benefits
[19:24:19] <Sadale> Oh. And those people with old money from their family. They just prosper without much work. While poor people just stay being poor. :/
[19:24:20] <Berlin36> wlep
[19:24:21] <Berlin36> yeah
[19:24:22] <MootPoot> you didnt do shit for them

[19:24:26] *** Suzuka sets mode: +q *!*@user/berlin36
[19:24:30] <DPA> Money is needed to exchange goods. Those are limited. Capitalism is an attempt to regulate goods. It uses maximazing money as a reward function, with the intent that it will lead to more and/or cheaper products, with the intent that having more stuff improves quality of life.
[19:24:30] <DPA> It doesn't work very well, as there are other ways to exploit the reward functions, and antitrust laws don't even begin to cover them, especially with nowadays technology. But we don't have a better system yet. However, the few regulations there are already an improvement over how things used to be.
[19:24:33] <MootPoot> rip
[19:24:45] <MootPoot> DPA: basically
[19:24:52] <MootPoot> its a shit system, but its the best we've managed so far
[19:25:16] <Sadale> Maybe instead of blaming capitalism, I should just say this world sucks
[19:25:25] <Sadale> But it's more dramatic to blame capitalism so why not? :P
[19:25:29] *** Suzuka sets mode: -q *!*@user/berlin36
[19:25:32] <Berlin36> oh finally
[19:25:55] <Berlin36> MootPoot, yes, im kinda ashamed that i still have to depend on my parents
[19:26:05] <Sadale> Berlin36, hey no need to feel shamed for that :3
[19:26:11] <MootPoot> so every living human should feel ashamed?
[19:26:16] <MootPoot> since they got something from their parents
[19:26:25] <Berlin36> welp, idk, i just feel like i need to do something and be independent
[19:26:28] <MootPoot> at the very least, their body
[19:26:48] <Sadale> Berlin36, I mean they volunatarily gave birth to you. And you just came into this world involuntarily. So they pretty much deserve to provide everything you need :P

[19:31:01] <Sadale> haha xD
[19:31:01] <Berlin36> to plug it in their butts
[19:31:02] <Berlin36> lol
[19:31:48] <Sadale> There's an organ called prostate that's accessible via male's butt. It does something to orgasm. I suppose that the buttplug is probably stimulating that...?
[19:31:58] <Berlin36> welp, i won't comment, do whatever you want to your butt
[19:32:02] <Sadale> lol
[19:32:20] <Sadale> Just be sure to lube up so that you won't damage whatever inside your butt

[19:37:01] <Sadale> MootPoot, or ask my imouto nicely for help xD
[19:37:14] <Berlin36> zoidberg, this laptop is around 620 bucks

[19:37:58] <Berlin36> umm
[19:37:59] <Berlin36> yes?
[19:38:09] <Berlin36> idk much about pc anyways
[19:38:10] <Sadale> Berlin36, what if you source your own components?
[19:38:12] <zoidberg> Berlin36: have you checked msi laptops? they have better heat sink compared to others
[19:38:23] <Berlin36> msi laptops are pretty expensive
[19:38:30] <Berlin36> and also i can't find them in local shops
[19:38:37] <Sadale> like purchasing the parts on your own. PC are often cheaper than laptop AFAIK
[19:39:01] <zoidberg> local shops? just buy them online silly
[19:39:08] <Sadale> Maybe it's a bit different in wherever you are tho. I'm living in a city so most of the PC parts are available for purchase here
[19:39:12] <Berlin36> welp, where from, zoidberg 
[19:39:27] <Berlin36> a lot of  sites won't even deliver it to my country
[19:39:28] <zoidberg> btw if you ask for a model, the local shop would get them for you if you like it that way Berlin36 
[19:39:28] <Sadale> zoidberg is from India.
[19:39:56] <MootPoot> Sadale: for equivalent performance yes, PC is cheaper ( assuming you dont need a gpu in the current market ) but the min price of a new laptop tends to be cheaper then a new desktop
[19:40:00] <zoidberg> yeah, I am from India.
[19:40:09] <Sadale> MootPoot, But he's looking at 622USD.
[19:40:13] <Berlin36> do you live in india now? zoidberg 
[19:40:14] <Sadale> the laptop
[19:40:21] <zoidberg> the land steeped with cows and curries
[19:40:28] <MootPoot> Sadale: cheapest new PC's here are about the same - without a monitor or keyboard etc
[19:40:37] <zoidberg> yes, I do unfortunately, yes Berlin36 
[19:40:43] <Sadale> MootPoot, hmm same here.
[19:40:45] <Berlin36> oh 
[19:40:48] <Sadale> But 622 USD isn't the cheapest one.
[19:41:05] <Berlin36> well i do have a keyboard, mouse, an ~1600x900 monitor 
[19:41:06] <Sadale> you're right about the monitor tho. keyboard and mouse are cheap so they don't really matter
[19:41:33] <Sadale> hey let's not waste them then. Build a PC instead :P
[19:41:38] <zoidberg> Sadale: btw aren't pc equivalent graphic cards better than laptops? 
[19:41:52] <Berlin36> :O
[19:41:53] <zoidberg> laptop's*
[19:42:00] <Sadale> zoidberg, yep if you purchase a graphic card. I don't think Berlin36 wants one tho.
[19:42:15] <Berlin36> idk much about hardware tbh
[19:42:34] <zoidberg> Sadale: is that only with graphic card?
[19:42:57] <zoidberg> honestly you won't be moving the laptop as much as you think you would Berlin36 
[19:43:19] <Sadale> zoidberg, actually if you're talking about iGPU, the laptop one could be even better than the PC one because the RAM can be clocked higher
[19:43:19] <zoidberg> building a pc is better and you can upgrade the shit 
[19:43:21] <MootPoot> Generally equivalently priced parts, the PC performs about 30% better
[19:43:48] <zoidberg> woah 30%!! why that much difference MootPoot?

[19:44:05] <Sadale> Berlin36, It depends on if you value energy efficiency and portability that much. If you don't value them that much, I'd recommend building a PC.
[19:44:05] <MootPoot> what do you mean why
[19:44:11] <MootPoot> its obvious
[19:44:19] <MootPoot> more power input 
[19:44:24] <MootPoot> more heat dissipation
[19:44:28] <MootPoot> more vroom vroom
[19:44:31] <zoidberg> oh
[19:45:05] <MootPoot> a laptop and a deskop i7 7700 for example
[19:45:12] <MootPoot> laptop takes about 25-35w I think
[19:45:17] <MootPoot> desktop one is about 100
[19:45:21] <Sadale> Berlin36, If you're worried about your skill, look up info online. When in doubt, ask questions here or even highlight me by saying "Sadale". I think most of the users here would be happy to answer you.
[19:45:23] <zoidberg> damn
[19:45:30] <zoidberg> that's a lot of watts
[19:45:38] <Berlin36> aight

[19:46:08] <MootPoot> I feel like I'm addicted to coffee
[19:46:09] <Sadale> zoidberg, indeed. PC takes are more watts.
[19:46:10] <Berlin36> is i7-4770k good processor?

[19:49:05] <Berlin36> btw
[19:49:10] <Sadale> So don't buy them. :P
[19:49:17] <Berlin36> i've read about a guy who was mining crypto on fucking PS4
[19:49:26] <Berlin36> he had like more than 20 in his basement
[19:49:32] <Sadale> lol
[19:49:39] <Berlin36> he was arrested i guess, idk much details

[19:49:47] <Berlin36> but mining on ps4 ...
[19:50:12] <zoidberg> Berlin36: don't be a fool like me and buy IPS like display. Check if it's actually real IPS display.
[19:50:15] <MootPoot> well the 3090 is a card you only really get for 1.) to show off  2.) if you need that 24gb video memory for AI work or 3d modelling/ video editing
[19:50:19] <Berlin36> oh wait
[19:50:22] <Berlin36> i found it

[19:50:46] <Sadale> 3800 xD
[19:50:55] <zoidberg> are we building pc?
[19:50:55] <Sadale> Where did he even find all those PS4s?

[19:51:01] <Berlin36> idk Sadale 
[19:51:08] <Sadale> zoidberg, I think Berlin36's looking into info on building a PC.
[19:51:13] <zoidberg> nice
[19:51:21] <Berlin36> i don't think i'll build one tho
[19:51:34] <Sadale> I'd actually suggest Berlin36 to look into building a PC even if he isn't build one. Just to evaluate if it'd be a better alternative than laptop (e.g. if it's cheaper, offers better performance, etc0
[19:51:35] <Berlin36> wow MootPoot, the 3090 has 24gb?

[20:15:26] <Berlin36> their password manager was generating passwords with time as a seed, so basically they could have acces to your passwords easily
[20:16:00] <MootPoot> getting used to this unix file system
[20:16:33] <Berlin36> why do people use fucking closed source password managers that costs bucks when they can use keepass
[20:16:38] <Berlin36> which is open source and free
[20:16:50] <MootPoot> cuz they want to
[20:16:57] <Berlin36> dumb pp move
[20:17:02] <MootPoot> lol
[20:17:09] <MootPoot> the thing with open source is lack of support
[20:17:14] <MootPoot> nobody is on the hook for it
[20:17:32] <MootPoot> so  when a open soruce thing dosent do what you want or fails
[20:17:36] <Berlin36> i mean it's not like you have to update it every day
[20:17:37] <MootPoot> nobody to go to
[20:17:56] <Berlin36> there is a big community 
[20:18:06] <MootPoot> Berlin36: in the business and enterprise world they pay the most for support and closed source software for this reason
[20:18:21] <Berlin36> welp
[20:18:42] <MootPoot> Berlin36: is that community there 24/7 and will they take a week out of their lives to come to your house/busisness fix your problem?
[20:18:45] <MootPoot> no they wont
[20:18:54] <Berlin36> yeaaaah 
[20:18:55] <Berlin36> but 
[20:19:04] <MootPoot> 1.) thing in business is reliability 
[20:19:05] <Berlin36> im talking specifically about a password manager
[20:19:20] <Berlin36> bigger projects require some more support and stuff, i agree
[20:19:25] <MootPoot> Berlin36: so? If you have a business of 50 thousand people and they all use your open source password manager
[20:19:27] <MootPoot> and it breaks
[20:19:31] <MootPoot> then what 
[20:19:32] <Berlin36> why would it break
[20:19:37] <MootPoot> 50 THOUSAND people cant do their work
[20:19:48] <Berlin36> it can't just b r e a k
[20:19:50] <MootPoot> Berlin36: software update, change in environment
[20:19:51] <MootPoot> etc
[20:19:54] <MootPoot> things break
[20:19:56] <ButterNoodle> lol
[20:20:02] <ButterNoodle> just 50K?
[20:20:10] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: listen I'm a canuck okay
[20:20:14] <MootPoot> 50k is a lot for us
[20:20:28] <ButterNoodle> yea yall only have 100K people in the entire cuntry
[20:20:47] <MootPoot> but anyway
[20:20:52] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: explain to him
[20:20:58] <MootPoot> shit just breaks sometimes
[20:21:00] <Berlin36> so um, you think an enterprise should pay literally thousands for a fucking password manager?
[20:21:05] <MootPoot> Berlin36: yes
[20:21:08] <ButterNoodle> yes
[20:21:09] <Berlin36> that also generates shit but not random passwords?
[20:21:17] <MootPoot> wym 
[20:21:19] <Berlin36> welp
[20:21:21] <ButterNoodle> its called accountability
[20:21:25] <MootPoot> ^^^
[20:21:29] <Berlin36> what's that
[20:21:52] <ButterNoodle> if some password manager leaks shit to the russians.. then its not some dog shit the company wrote.. they can put the blame elsewhere
[20:21:57] <MootPoot> Berlin36: if 50k people cant do their work for say 1 day cuz your password manager broke - thats a few million dollars in wasted salary
[20:22:09] <Berlin36> welp
[20:22:12] <ButterNoodle> wow
[20:22:15] <MootPoot> compare that to a few thousand dollars for alicence

[20:42:04] <ButterNoodle> yea MootPoot.. and cheese
[20:42:52] <TsundereNoises> I think the biggest learned skill with cooking is knowing when something looks/tastes wrong for what it should look like at that stage, and knowing how to fix it
[20:43:00] <TsundereNoises> and you just don't get that from a recipe
[20:43:08] <TsundereNoises> just gotta cook things a bunch

[20:44:22] <MootPoot> can I make my own almond flour
[20:44:22] <TsundereNoises> ButterNoodle: yeah but you can fix that by just buying a meat thermometer and usig it
[20:44:27] <MootPoot> seems like bulk almonds are way cheaper
[20:44:33] <MootPoot> can i just uber grind them
[20:44:43] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: you can, but not sure how you'd grind up enough for some things

[20:45:06] <ButterNoodle> even tho cooking is literally a science experiment
[20:45:08] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: you need a really good food processor to get them small enough, unless the smallness doesn't matter much
[20:45:15] <MootPoot> I always ram my meat rod deep into my chicken and beef to check if they're cooked

[20:58:34] <MootPoot> is red hat paid?
[20:58:36] <Poeticode> could also try Fedora Silverblue for an immutable system with easy rollbacks if something breaks
[20:58:54] <ButterNoodle> red hat doesnt exist anymore
[20:59:05] <emmeka> MootPoot basically RHEL charges you for tech support and also access to forms of the OS you could actually install
[20:59:07] <ButterNoodle> after 9.x it split to rhel and fedora
[20:59:22] <MootPoot> rhel-ease
[20:59:31] <emmeka> it's open source, but like, in the sense that it's just the source code that is open
[20:59:44] <MootPoot> sounds like aurora would hate it

[21:00:06] <ButterNoodle> because its nt gnu
[21:00:16] <emmeka> RHEL is FOSS, it just doesn't give you a nice live image to install from for free
[21:00:25] <MootPoot> auroroa is full on anti anything corporate
[21:00:27] <MootPoot> basically
[21:00:45] <emmeka> RHEL doesn't even include proprietary packages by default, you have to enable them

[21:01:06] <MootPoot> stop calling it RHEL
[21:01:08] <MootPoot> idk
[21:01:09] <TsundereNoises> anyway the only reason I was surprised was because in my mental profile of MootPoot, if he switched to linux he'd use Mint
[21:01:13] <MootPoot> feels weird
[21:01:19] <MootPoot> TsundereNoises: ur mint
[21:01:35] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: ur MOM is minty
[21:01:43] <MootPoot> it feels weird for it to be called anything but just simply "red hat"
[21:01:47] <emmeka> MootPoot Red Hat is the company. 
[21:01:52] <emmeka> which has multiple things
[21:01:59] <emmeka> RHEL is the operating system
[21:02:10] <MootPoot> I know it makes no sense
[21:02:19] <MootPoot> everyone around me always called it red hat
[21:02:24] * MootPoot shurgs
[21:04:14] <MootPoot> TsundereNoises: I tried mint ...
[21:04:20] <MootPoot> didnt really click with me
[21:04:28] <MootPoot> I did buntu as well
[21:04:31] <MootPoot> buntu was weird
[21:04:52] <MootPoot> its like they stuck on a sugar layer of user friendliness but its only like 1mm thich
[21:05:00] <MootPoot> so its just as much effort as any other
[21:05:21] <emmeka> MootPoot anyway, you realize a RHEL license costs hundreds a year, right. If you wanna try it, just try Fedora.
[21:05:27] <TsundereNoises> on the other hand, any linux is easier to fix shit going wrong once you have some clue what you're doing
[21:05:27] <MootPoot> what really
[21:05:34] <MootPoot> emmeka: you pay 100s a year?
[21:05:38] <TsundereNoises> rather than hiding everything as much as possible
[21:05:46] <emmeka> no. I use Fedora. as I've told you about 50 times.

[21:15:04] <emmeka> MootPoot if you want to try RHEL-like things, just try Fedora, which is just upstream RHEL and doesn't cost money. The only reason to actually get RHEL is if you need the support and you need all their spiffy dev/professional software
[21:15:05] <MootPoot> me being me, I figured out enough about ubuntu to install it on the crap compaq computer - then proceeded to watch euphoria

[21:15:29] <MootPoot> I dont remember
[21:16:58] <MootPoot> TsundereNoises, emmeka then my dad decided to do the same thing to me again except with a java book
[21:17:07] <MootPoot> I refused to program for a year after that
[21:17:41] <emmeka> when I got in trouble as a kid, I had to handwrite essays about what I'd done wrong
[21:17:52] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: ah, so I should actually force my children to read shounen manga, so they refuse to read it out of spite
[21:17:53] <emmeka> the length of which was the severity of the punishment
[21:17:54] <TsundereNoises> good plan
[21:18:09] <emmeka> do you know how hard it is to write a 10 page essay about why you shouldn't leave the woodstove door open
[21:18:30] <TsundereNoises> yeah, you'd run out of reasons after about half a page
[21:18:34] <emmeka> with citations!
[21:18:48] <MootPoot> It might not work TsundereNoises - my dad did it again with a book on visual basic a year later, and I took to it just fine
[21:18:54] <TsundereNoises> seems like a great exercise in how to pad wordcount
[21:19:05] <emmeka> it did teach me to write well enough
[21:19:36] <MootPoot> emmeka: lol sounds like you could just make it into a story about how your house might burn down and your parents would burn up and spend the rest of the 10 pages describing as closely as possible every bit of their bodies burning up
[21:19:41] <MootPoot> or at least

[21:59:48] <TsundereNoises> that's how japanese/chinese people can read small fonts too
[21:59:59] <Berlin36> if the first and last letter are in their place, then most likely you'll read the wrod corrctely
[22:00:14] <Berlin36> lol it sometimes is really evident tbh
[22:00:24] <TsundereNoises> there are some fonts where you just can't figure out what the kanji is and have to stare at it forever, but a native japanese speaker gets it no problem

[22:04:14] <TsundereNoises> also "shape of the word" is legitimately the best way I can think of to explain it, I've seen other people use it before, I don't know why you're so hung up on it
[22:04:35] <TsundereNoises> how else would you describe like the contour of the tops of the letters and how long a word is
[22:04:36] <snake> i'm not arguing
[22:04:53] <snake> but yeah the letters between the first and last are scrambled
[22:05:02] <TsundereNoises> no but you're trying to like make fun of something that's a perfectly reasonable phrase for no discernible reason

[22:05:13] <Berlin36> woah, a 1tb hdd is two times more expensive than a 120gb ssd
[22:05:26] <TsundereNoises> or rather phrasing things as if you're making fun of something but in a way that's not really amusing, it's just weird

[22:11:36] <Berlin36> i can connect a flash disk to my phone in case i need to store files
[22:12:00] <Berlin36> and i have 64gb of storage and it's enough
[22:12:03] <snake> i usually just use network to transfer files anyways
[22:12:13] <snake> so my usb thumb drives and sd cards are just in a drawer
[22:12:19] <snake> collecting must
[22:12:20] <Berlin36> some girls at school have like 15thousands of photos
[22:12:25] <TsundereNoises> I use thumb drives reasonable often actually
[22:12:35] <Berlin36> what is a thumb drie
[22:12:40] <TsundereNoises> usb stick
[22:12:46] <Berlin36> oh
[22:12:47] <snake> aka flash drive
[22:12:47] <Berlin36> yeah
[22:12:51] <Berlin36> i have 2 of them
[22:12:53] <Berlin36> 8 gb
[22:13:03] <Berlin36> but i don't even use them, i can use my phone as a flash disk
[22:13:29] <TsundereNoises> I have like 20 scattered around, I use them for all kinds of things
[22:13:41] <TsundereNoises> by "all kinds of things" I mean transferring files from one place to another
[22:13:51] <Berlin36> i can make empty images on my phone and use them as a flash disk
[22:14:10] <Berlin36> like even installing linux on pc
[22:14:37] <Berlin36> for transfering files from a place to another i use network 
[22:14:52] <TsundereNoises> that sounds like something to do because you get off on it rather than the most convenient way to do things
[22:14:56] <TsundereNoises> but whatever floats your boat
[22:15:44] <Berlin36> welp
[22:16:53] <Berlin36> what can you even store on a 8 gb flash disk
[22:17:33] <TsundereNoises> look, man, if you get off on installing linux from an image file, that's between you and your loved ones
[22:17:55] <Berlin36> xd
[22:18:20] <Berlin36> no but, im not talking about installing a os
[22:18:34] <Berlin36> do people use flash disk to store data
[22:18:38] <Berlin36> like for a long time
[22:19:00] <TsundereNoises> seriously I think what I use USB drives for most is anime episodes (which I haven't watched hardly any of lately.) I usually watch on different devices than I download on, and you can just play off the drive in a way that's a pain in the ass from a network, at least with my mediocre router
[22:19:04] <TsundereNoises> also music for the car
[22:19:11] <TsundereNoises> now that I have a car with no cd player
[22:19:28] <Berlin36> oh
[22:19:32] <Berlin36> i see
[22:19:35] <TsundereNoises> I miss having a cd player in the car
[22:19:59] <TsundereNoises> I was so good at changing cds while driving, now that's a worthless skill
[22:20:03] <Berlin36> yeah, my dad has a lot of CDs with music
[22:20:13] <Berlin36> they're like 700mb each
[22:20:31] <TsundereNoises> for music cds the hard limit is usually the 80 minutes rather than the data limit
[22:20:40] <Berlin36> oh
[22:20:42] <Berlin36> how does that work

[22:20:53] <Berlin36> yo dweltstorm 
[22:21:01] <HeTo> didn't many car stereos support MP3 files?
[22:21:03] <dweltstorm> hello
[22:21:07] <TsundereNoises> it's something to do with how it's encoded to play in a cd player, you can get more data on them than that, but not in a way that standard cd players played
[22:21:16] <Berlin36> oh
[22:21:20] <Berlin36> right
[22:21:33] <dweltstorm> whatre you guys talking about
[22:21:34] <TsundereNoises> HeTo: I mean some later ones did, but that was right around when they started phasing out cd players I think
[22:21:40] <HeTo> 80 minutes of CD music is more than 700 MiB, it is the space that runs out
[22:21:40] <TsundereNoises> I think there aren't too many years of tat
[22:22:03] <HeTo> more than, because audio CDs have less error correction than data CDs and can therefore fit more data
[22:22:05] <Berlin36> different stuff, dweltstorm 
[22:22:15] <TsundereNoises> HeTo: no, the time limit is absolute, it's there even with smaller file sizes
[22:22:30] * Aurora_v_kosmose rolls in
[22:22:32] <HeTo> TsundereNoises: there are no files on an audio CD
[22:22:34] <Berlin36> yo Aurora_v_kosmose 
[22:22:41] <dweltstorm> hey aurora
[22:22:41] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Hewwo
[22:22:42] <HeTo> unless you have a data track but then it's no longer merely an audio CD
[22:22:53] <TsundereNoises> HeTo: with less data I mean
[22:23:38] <TsundereNoises> HeTo: point is, you can't do more than 80 minutes
[22:23:47] <HeTo> 80 minutes of CD quality audio is 807.5 MiB
[22:24:02] <dweltstorm> wait you can only store 700 mb on a cd?
[22:24:06] <Berlin36> but even if it was bad quality, i guess it'd still be 80 min?
[22:24:12] <TsundereNoises> but you can go up to like exactly 80 minutes
[22:24:13] <HeTo> 80 min * 60 s/min * 44100 samples/s * 2 bytes/sample * 2 channels
[22:24:23] <Berlin36> dweltstorm, there are different CDs i guess
[22:24:33] <Bco1981> i had some 900mb cd-r
[22:24:39] <Berlin36> hey Bco1981 
[22:24:45] <Bco1981> hey Berlin36 
[22:24:46] <TsundereNoises> Berlin36: yeah, data cds are a thing, but most cars couldn't read them, there was some window of cars that could
[22:24:49] <TsundereNoises> but I never drove one
[22:24:53] <Berlin36> ooh
[22:24:59] <HeTo> dweltstorm: officially, it's 650 MiB or so, but discs and drives usually support more in practice
[22:25:08] <Berlin36> i've a cd reader on my laptop
[22:25:23] <Berlin36> idk how to use it because it needs some drivers i guess
[22:25:26] <Berlin36> im on arch now
[22:25:26] <TsundereNoises> at the start, most cars couldn't, even when other things could, then they could, then car companies started using usb and bluetooth and making cd players an extra you had to pay for
[22:25:28] <HeTo> dweltstorm: that is, if we are talking about the data that a data CD can have. the CD itself can store a lot more but a lot of that is spent on error correction
[22:25:35] <TsundereNoises> and no one pays for the extra cd player

[22:38:16] <SummerSkies> I'm about to grill a steak that's been marinating for 3 days

[22:38:58] <dweltstorm> young
[22:39:13] <TsundereNoises> anyway anything that can read a dvd can read a cd, but not the other way around

[22:41:46] <Berlin36> that's VLC output on trying to read a dvd
[22:42:25] <dweltstorm> Berlin36: didnt you say it was a cd drive
[22:42:56] <Berlin36> nono
[22:42:58] <Berlin36> well
[22:43:00] <Berlin36> um
[22:43:15] <dweltstorm> because cd drives cant play dvds
[22:43:18] <Berlin36> oh
[22:43:36] <Berlin36> oh it says it's dvd
[22:43:41] <Berlin36> on the laptop
[22:43:57] <dweltstorm> then its a dvd drive lol
[22:44:00] <Berlin36> ye
[22:44:31] <dweltstorm> why doesn't it work straight out of the box with arch
[22:44:55] <Berlin36> idk, it works i guess, but i never used it
[22:44:57] <Berlin36> so idk how to use it
[22:45:56] <dweltstorm> logic checks out
[22:46:08] <TsundereNoises> Berlin36: it's probably an older dvd format than the one VLC wants you to use, I think there's some package you can install that fixes some of those, others you just have to rip and burn a new dvd in a newer format
[22:46:08] <Berlin36> AYYY it worked
[22:46:16] <Berlin36> i copied the contents to my home directory
[22:46:17] <dweltstorm> nice

[23:18:41] <omero> Berlin36: possibly damaged media?
[23:19:11] <dweltstorm> what the fuck i got the exact same score on my english quiz
[23:19:14] <dweltstorm> brb bathroom
[23:19:31] <dweltstorm> nvm teacher wont let me
[23:19:33] <omero> if you are on linux, you can use ddresque to recover most of the data even in presence of errors
[23:19:48] <Berlin36> may be omero

[23:23:13] <dweltstorm> ive seen vids of me from when i was like 4
[23:23:20] <dweltstorm> we lived in a one room apartment at that time
[23:23:44] <Berlin36> omero, i tried copying the contents, and even like that i couldn't
[23:23:45] <dweltstorm> now we have a pretty big house and i have 2 brothers
[23:23:52] <Berlin36> ill try that one another time
[23:24:00] <Berlin36> nice dweltstorm 
[23:24:52] <dweltstorm> gtg
[23:24:54] <Berlin36> ok
[23:24:58] <dweltstorm> ill see you guys after school
[23:25:01] <Berlin36> aight
[23:25:02] *** Quits: dweltstorm (~dweltstor@204.108.107.161) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:26:14] <emmeka> a while ago I found a VCD that I made for my younger brother of him racing soap box cars
[23:26:23] <emmeka> that was pretty neat
[23:26:49] <emmeka> I probably it from tape, somehow, at the time
[23:26:52] <TsundereNoises> my childhood videos were all on VHS and I think my parents threw them all out this fall
[23:27:40] <emmeka> there's very few childhood videos of me, but renting a camcorder back then was expensive
[23:28:43] *** Joins: aHick (~memes@143.60.228.11)
[23:29:31] <Berlin36> welp, checking next one
[23:30:42] <TsundereNoises> my dad just bought a camcorder, it was huge
[23:31:06] <emmeka> big spender
[23:31:23] <emmeka> those things cost like $2000, back then.
[23:31:29] <Berlin36> welp, this one's loading pretty slow
[23:31:31] <TsundereNoises> yeah but it was exciting I think, and they had 3 kids
[23:31:40] <TsundereNoises> but yeah, I'm sure it was pricey
[23:31:50] <emmeka> even mini-DV camcorders were still really expensive
[23:32:18] <TsundereNoises> he also had a mobile phone back when they were like a big hardcover-sized book thing you unzipped
[23:32:23] <emmeka> it's kind of crazy how quickly that change happened. we went from home video recording being a very expensive luxury in the early 2000s and any sort of actual video editing equipment being basically priced out of consumer use, to basically everyone having high grade video cameras and editing software by the end of the 2010s
[23:32:43] <Berlin36> yess
[23:32:53] <Berlin36> amazed by how far humanity just evolves
[23:33:50] <TsundereNoises> yeah, one did not simply edit a home video back then
[23:34:30] <emmeka> the only pictures I have of my childhood before the age of like 10 are ones taken at photo studios, and ones that I took myself with my little film camera that I wasn't honestly very good at using.
[23:34:31] <Berlin36> most of these dvd are 1.4gb 30 min
[23:34:45] <Berlin36> aw emmeka 
[23:35:12] <emmeka> that, and I have a laminated photo of the barn on the farm I grew up on, taken by my grandmother
[23:35:13] <Bco1981> back in 1999 the tnt2ultra asys card i had, had tv-in so i started doing some video edit back then
[23:35:20] <Bco1981> asus*
[23:35:41] <Bco1981> unfitunately i don't have that card anymore.
[23:35:49] <Bco1981> unfortunately*
[23:36:02] <Berlin36> oh
[23:36:10] <Berlin36> what happened to that card
[23:36:15] <emmeka> Berlin36 well it's not that depressing, that's how things were for most people only a generation ago
[23:36:33] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: we found a whole roll of film I'd taken as like an 8 year old: it was exclusively blurry pictures of cats
[23:36:39] <emmeka> haha
[23:36:39] <Bco1981> pass on to some one else during the years. until i lost track of it.
[23:36:54] <Berlin36> oh
[23:37:01] <emmeka> when I developed a lot of old film I had about 10 years ago I'd say a solid 1/3 of it was pictures of structures I built out of legos
[23:37:16] <emmeka> young me had his priorities
[23:37:21] <Berlin36> oh fuck
[23:37:22] <Berlin36> VLC is unable to open the MRL 'file:///home/john/dvd/unknown'. Check the log for details.
[23:37:38] <Berlin36> i copied it and it doesn't open :(
[23:37:58] <Berlin36> cannot open file /home/john/dvd/unknown (Permission denied)
[23:38:05] <TsundereNoises> I don't understand how legos are more important than cat pictures
[23:38:07] <TsundereNoises> what a weird kid
[23:38:07] <Berlin36> what does that mean, permission denied lol
[23:38:35] <TsundereNoises> probably the file permissions are set so you don't have permission
[23:39:15] <Berlin36> aaand how can i fix that
[23:39:17] <emmeka> either chmod whatever you're trying to run, or just run VLC in root if you're lazy and like living dangerously
[23:39:26] <Berlin36> vlc won't let me root
[23:39:37] <emmeka> sure it does.
[23:39:43] <Berlin36> no
[23:39:44] <emmeka> just pop open a terminal, sudo vlc
[23:39:55] <Berlin36> VLC is not supposed to be run as root. Sorry.
[23:40:09] <TsundereNoises> not supposed to isn't the same thing as "can't"
[23:40:13] <emmeka> it isn't, and this isn't the good way to do things
[23:40:13] <Berlin36> If you need to use real-time priorities and/or privileged TCP ports \\\ you can use vlc-wrapper (make sure it is Set-UID root and
[23:40:13] <Berlin36> cannot be run by non-trusted users first).
[23:40:25] <emmeka> Berlin36 anyway, just chmod the thing
[23:40:38] <Berlin36> chmod with what arguments
[23:40:52] <TsundereNoises> oh weird, it actually tries to prevent you being an idiot? how corporate of them
[23:40:56] <Berlin36> xd
[23:42:10] <emmeka> Berlin open terminal, cd to wherever the file is, chmod a=rwx [file name]
[23:42:15] <Berlin36> i did 755
[23:42:20] <Berlin36> now it seems to run
[23:42:23] <Berlin36> but it loads 
[23:42:27] <Berlin36> and loads..
[23:42:32] <MootPoot> sudo apt-get install powershell
[23:42:38] <Berlin36> dud-
[23:42:55] <Berlin36> idk what to do, it just loads lol
[23:43:00] <Berlin36> nothing happens
[23:43:19] <Berlin36> no more permission error tho
[23:43:47] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: u dont know shit
