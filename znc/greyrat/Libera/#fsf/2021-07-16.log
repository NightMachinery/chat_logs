[00:00:04] <Noisytoot> zleap, running GUI programs as root is a bad idea (and often difficult)
[00:00:19] <zleap> sure i understand that
[00:00:31] <Kelp> My mom uses a ton of proprietary windows only applications 
[00:00:37] <Kelp> Linux isn't an option for her
[00:00:45] <Kelp> Not like she would switch anyways
[00:00:49] <Kelp> She hates change
[00:00:58] <zleap> but if you say to someone Linux is easier than Windows, then tell them to use the command line they may not feel the same way
[00:01:08] <tpefreedom> GNU/Linux
[00:01:12] <zleap> yes
[00:01:17] <Kelp> I'm the opposite. I love change. I use 3 different messaging apps so I get to use different GUIs 
[00:01:48] <zleap> we need to put our non techy hats on and think about things from a normal user perspective sometimes
[00:02:00] <zleap> which is difficult
[00:02:08] <Kelp> Yeah
[00:02:20] <tpefreedom> linux on it's own includes android/replicant/lineage os/chrome os in addition to fedora/debian/trisquel/ubuntu/arch/etc.
[00:02:21] <Kelp> Where are my fellow normie free software users at?
[00:02:23] <ggoes> fyi i just protected the actual "freedom ladder" lp wiki page so different people editing doesn't cause confusion; everyone should still be able to edit the discussion page it links to, though
[00:02:28] <zleap> i am sure i found a way at the gui level to get a file system to mount,  but using a gui tool
[00:02:42] <zleap> i can't remember what I did, i more 'happened' upon that as a solution
[00:03:00] <zleap> ggoes, ok cool
[00:03:18] <Kelp> I have my minetest open ready to slack off during the meeting
[00:03:39] <psydroid> My mom uses GNU/Linux, but she doesn't know about proprietary applications that she should be using
[00:03:59] <Kelp> She shouldn't be using any proprietary applications lol
[00:04:21] <zleap> i think that is more that people assume / expect you to be using MS office for example

[00:05:28] <tpefreedom> Also, there is onlyoffice.
[00:05:39] <Kelp> Lol how is microsofts file format a standard?
[00:05:47] <tpefreedom> OnlyOffice is also free/libre but looks even more like MS office.
[00:05:49] <Kelp> Opendocument is the standard right?
[00:05:51] <zleap> it is when lots of people use it 
[00:06:08] <zleap> Opendocument format is a open standard, 
[00:06:18] <Noisytoot> Kelp, OOXML (Office Open XML, microsoft's format) is an "open" ISO and ECMA standard
[00:06:19] <Kelp> How can it be a standard if it isn't open?
[00:06:26] <zleap> If you download a job application form it is still in .docx format
[00:06:27] <Kelp> Neat noisytoot
[00:06:36] <Noisytoot> Microsoft bribed ISO to standardize it
[00:06:44] <Kelp> Bribed? owo

[00:08:30] <zleap> you could ask for a pdf

[00:08:40] <Kelp> It was last minute tho lol
[00:09:07] <zleap> this is kinda what we are up against

[00:10:04] <zleap> yeah
[00:10:17] <tpefreedom> So a fxck ton of nonfree JS.
[00:10:22] <zleap> and if MS decide your subscription is due you are stuffed
[00:10:37] <tpefreedom> There is a gratis version of MS office online.
[00:10:41] <zleap> which has happened to people
[00:10:51] <tpefreedom> You don't have to pay microsoft, at least in cash.
[00:11:09] <tpefreedom> They might collect your data and turn it into a product.
[00:11:11] <zleap> as a student you need to get assignments in on time or lose marks, 
[00:11:21] <arielcostas> You don't pay cash, you only pay with your data

[00:13:32] <arielcostas> There is EtherPad, EtherCalc and NextCloud

[00:13:47] <Kelp> They want an "it just works" program

[00:16:31] <Kelp> crypt.ee is close to being a google docs replacement
[00:17:07] <Kelp> Or cryptpad.fr
[00:17:13] <zleap> tpefreedom, this is where we need more people to provide that training
[00:17:33] <zleap> which is supply vs demand 
[00:17:47] <arielcostas> A lot of people use Microsoft, Google and Facebook products because they don't read the license and aren't really conscious about all the privacy problems they have

[00:22:09] <zleap> yes
[00:22:18] <Ranger77> arielcostas I use Linux that i mentioned is a Windows that runs on cloud, the user computer does not have storage.
[00:22:22] <zleap> that has been suggested so twitter federates, 
[00:22:29] <Kelp> I finally annoyed my friends enough to switch to a secure communication platform
[00:22:35] <Noisytoot> Kelp, if your home internet goes down, the files aren't lost permenantly
[00:23:12] <Kelp> But you can't access them then tho

[00:30:39] <ggoes> in case you're not aware, the freedom ladder is a new campaign we're trying to use to help bring people who haven't heard of gnu or linux before into the movement.
[00:30:42] <zleap> secret is to a) keep it simple, b) avoind having to explain everything unless people really really want to know more
[00:30:57] <ggoes> in the interest of that, we're developing a step by step guide to take someone from that "0" state to their first free operating system
[00:31:15] <ggoes> today's meeting is focused specifically on our first two (draft) steps: understanding nonfree software, and finding your own reason to use free software
[00:31:21] <Kelp> That's not possible if you have a job or school lol.
[00:31:36] <zleap> Kelp, this is something we will try and brainstorm
[00:31:38] <ggoes> previously those were switched, so i'm wondering how people feel about using nonfree software as an "in" to talking about free software
[00:31:39] <Kelp> I use free software because communism
[00:31:44] <Kelp> xD
[00:31:59] <Ranger77> +1
[00:32:13] <zleap> wel you may need to mention that LibreOffice is a replacement for MS office
[00:32:20] <Kelp> Or ONLYOFFICE
[00:32:24] <zleap> yeah
[00:32:35] <Kelp> I think onlyoffice might have some proprietary blobs tho...
[00:32:38] <zleap> choose the replacement you can help people with
[00:32:45] <ggoes> what i had in mind was capitalizing (;)) on the general distrust people have for big tech etc to talking about free software, and the importance of controlling your own computing
[00:33:12] <ggoes> there's benefit to starting to talk about freedom right away, but i worry that's too abstract for the average person, who isn't used to thinking of personal liberty very much at all
[00:33:21] <zleap> ys
[00:33:42] <Kelp> It's hard to get people who aren't programmers to care about free software and FLOSS
[00:33:52] <Noisytoot> Kelp, According to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnlyOffice, the mobile apps are nonfree
[00:34:03] <Kelp> Ah rip
[00:34:34] <ggoes> i should mention that the steps we've devised are really gradual; someone isn't even trying gnu/linux until the last step. so it's primarily focused on people who arent' especially technical and who aren't already in the development community

[00:36:04] <ggoes> [i'm aware that firefox has problems, but we're starting small here]

[00:36:14] <Noisytoot> ggoes, IceCat
[00:36:20] <Kelp> My dad has so many chrome bookmarks it would take forever to transfer over to Firefox
[00:36:21] <Noisytoot> or lynx, or eww
[00:36:50] <ggoes> Noisytoot: as far as i'm aware there is no icecat build for windows, and while i think it's important to get people on that eventually, i worry about alienating people and giving them icecat or a text browser out of the gate
[00:36:57] <tpefreedom> Noisytoot, many people have workflows requiring a graphical browser.
[00:37:04] <gilq> People use free software if the nonfree counterpart is not convenient (see the VLC case). I know it's not a matter of convenience for the free software movement, but for the general public it is.
[00:37:05] <ggoes> it'll only re-emphasize an opinion they might already have, that free software "doesn't work" etc
[00:37:10] <zleap> tpefreedom, yes
[00:37:10] <ggoes> vlc is a good choice
[00:37:12] <Kelp> I only use a text based browser for the memes

[00:38:02] <Kelp> Says they all have a horrible UI and UX and they barely work
[00:38:08] <gilq> Kelp: if chrome cannot export bookmarks in a standard format like... HTML or JSON, then it has serious issues.
[00:38:26] <ggoes> when we're thinking about "understanding nonfree software", are there any particular abuses of proprietary software that people here find the most troubling, or even better, that have been effective in getting people to consider free replacements?
[00:38:28] <Kelp> Lol Chrome does have serious issues
[00:38:34] <Kelp> But i'll look into to exporting bookmarks
[00:38:52] <ggoes> (e.g. backdoors, app spying, vendor lock-in, what have you)
[00:39:02] <Kelp> The main issue with proprietary software is that it's not interoperable 
[00:39:03] <lxo> in my experience of activism, part of the problem is that many people often present partial steps as a solution, instead of as steps in the right direction, and then users get very frustrated when they find out the "solution" doesn't really get them what they wish, and suspicious of other "solutions" presented to them
[00:39:06] <Kelp> Or however you spell that word
[00:39:12] <zleap> other than anti trust stuff, which i think law is like tech, it just makes people run the other way
[00:39:18] <ggoes> that makes sense lxo
[00:39:21] <Anon_> hey guys, cant read much at moment because of work, I will can see all messages saved in some place later ?

[00:44:34] <tpefreedom> I live in the US, so I'm most familiar with the ways our politics are borked.
[00:44:39] <ggoes> i should mention that the *last* thing we want this to be is a traditional "get into gnu/linux" guide, because we never want to give the impression that using nonfree software is a desirable outcome. in the sense that many guides never mention freedom at all, and end with installing ubuntu.
[00:45:05] <Kelp> I don't have the money for a free system
[00:45:06] <ggoes> at the same time, though, we need to "help people where they are" and help them take steps toward freedom incrementally

[00:45:42] <gilq> I think the first step is to put a clear separation between freedom and privacy. It has happened that some free software spied on the users (I think... Ubuntu was such an example, but don't quote me on that because I'm not sure)
[00:45:45] <Noisytoot> the boot firmware isn't 100% free
[00:45:54] <Kelp> And i'm not going to use a super old thinkpad that'll take 5 hours to open a web browser 
[00:45:55] <tpefreedom> IMO ubuntu/manjaro/fedora could be good middle steps if someone lacks support for important hardware (or has grub fxck up when using linux-libre.)

[00:48:11] <lxo> "flag day" migrations, in which the user suddenly finds that none of the familiar programs are there, often backfire.  switching to free apps first renders the non-free underlying OS irrelevant, then that transition goes smoothly and painlessly

[00:49:23] <Noisytoot> https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/
[00:49:37] <ggoes> i think gradually acclimating people by means of free apps is important, and then switching to a free OS after they've grown comfortable with those. i think it's regrettable but understandable that people who try to switch everything at once come away frustrated and even more likely to use nonfree software
[00:49:38] <zleap> ok fixed
[00:49:42] <tpefreedom> My first experiences with GNU?linux were on an old laptop I got for $20 and then this laptop when the hdd started to go bad.
[00:50:05] <gilq> The first thing should be make users understand why it's important to make the switch to free software.
[00:50:05] <zleap> i started on a 486 back in about 1994
[00:50:31] <Kelp> My first experince with linux was on an old core 2 duo machine lol
[00:50:36] <zleap> gilq, i would argue prove it works first then discuss the freedom bit
[00:50:54] <lispmacs[work]> i think it depends a lot on the individual
[00:51:00] <zleap> yes
[00:51:10] <zleap> so find out what the user needs their computer for
[00:51:19] <tpefreedom> I started on this machine because it was a little too unstable to be a daily driver but almost everything besides the hdd worked fine, so I used it to learn GNU/Linux.
[00:51:22] <Kelp> My mom uses inkscape but doesn't even care that it's free software
[00:51:28] <Kelp> She only cares about the gratis aspect
[00:51:44] <ggoes> right gilq. that's why step two is "getting their own reason to use free software." if the reason comes from within, i think they're more likely to stick with it. some people might be more passionate about protecting their privacy, or reducing environmental waste by using an older computer longer than proprietary software would allow them
[00:51:45] <zleap> in some ways the freedom part is more about source code etc
[00:52:02] <ggoes> they have to find their own motivation; that's what's going to push them through the rest of the steps
[00:52:13] <Kelp> s/they/test
[00:52:14] <Noisytoot> If they don't care that it's free, then if they find something else that's gratis and works better, they'll switch
[00:52:19] <lispmacs[work]> there are some people that will do a gradual change. but then there are a lot of people that are glad to use some free software apps but never care to learn about the principles
[00:52:21] <lxo> highlighting the gratis aspect is not so good.  besides the frequent association of gratis with low quality, nowadays people hear that if they're not paying for something, they're the product
[00:52:30] <ggoes> +1 lxo
[00:52:30] <gilq> zleap Great point. We should build a list of free programs that works great and then propose a pros/cons table.

[00:53:59] <gilq> Thank you ggoes and zoe :)
[00:53:59] <zleap> Noisytoot, yes so maybe we explain the 4 freedoms but context to their interest 
[00:54:03] <lxo> I like to talk about control.  people would probably dislike the notion of having someone else control a part of their body, and they pretty much perceive their pocket/purse computers as extensions to their body.  conveying the notion that they should aim for having control of that as much as of any other part of their bodies may be useful
[00:54:15] <zleap> so put more emphasis on as you said benefitting from improvements
[00:54:36] <ggoes> yeah. it's hard to remember but i think it's the "control" / personal liberty element that first attracted me to free software
[00:54:38] <zleap> you can update a linux systemwhen you choose
[00:54:54] <ggoes> feeling i was entitled to control my own computing, and it was being deprived from me, etc
[00:55:00] <zleap> i have lost count how many times i have seen people doing a presentation with Windows and have their laptop try and reboot due to updates
[00:55:34] <Noisytoot> Why isn't emacs in the text editor category?
[00:55:50] <zleap> Windows / MS know best,  vs user is respected and trusted to apply updates as needed
[00:56:02] <lxo> I wonder if this notion of control over your own body would still work with recent generations, who were born into a world of surveilling devices
[00:56:08] <lispmacs[work]> i think Emacs is supposed to be in the OS category
[00:56:23] <gilq> Kelp: that's a table of "equivalence". There is no pros/cons. We then come back to the argument "if they are the same software, why should I bother learning to use another one since I'm already comfortable with the (nonfree) software I run?"
[00:56:49] <Noisytoot> there's also https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Collection:GNU/Linux, which is the same but for GNU/Linux
[00:57:19] <lxo> calling emacs a text editor is heresy :-)   it's an extensible developmente environment

Thinking about that now seems odd and far away, but software to me was like ordering a finished painting, not the paint if that makes sense. It took me a while to understand you can do the actual painting.  
[00:58:56] <tpefreedom> good point
[00:58:58] <gilq> I know that it goes a bit against the philosophy of the free software movement, but I think we should keep it a bit more on the technical side. For instance: "Windows automatically decided to do updates. You have a meeting in 5 minutes and the slides you need are on that computer." Something along these lines....
[00:59:00] <zleap> zoe, same for cooking,  you can make own meals rather than buying ready meals, you decide what goes in
[00:59:27] <zleap> that is more important when you have allergies that can be lethal
[00:59:27] <tpefreedom> I guess that is also an extension of traditional unix philosophy: favoring a bunch of small programs working together over one monolith.
[00:59:48] <Noisytoot> gilq, It's important that they also know about free software, otherwise they might switch to something nonfree (and maybe "better")

[01:04:37] <madage> on this control aspect, I think one way to put it for people who do not know how to program and who do not feel inclined to learning/reading source code is to point them that someone will have that power and that it could be either a monopolist company or a community 
[01:04:40] <ggoes> i think another question is how soon we want to start introducing people to terminology. "free" is going to be a big one, especially in english. at the same time we don't want to overwhelm them with a wholly new set of vocabulary

[01:09:50] <ggoes> yeah gilq. i think presenting the four freedoms is definitely important at least in the first half of the ladder, but i'm not sure about doing it incredibly early. at least explicitly. more just articulating the ways they're *applied* in a particular way with free software. i.e. everyone being able to contribute and share, but not rattling off the 0-3 list itself

[01:09:58] <zleap> madage, part of that is we are seen as elitist 
[01:10:10] <lxo> the terms free and freedom have so often been abused that, besides their abstractness, sometimes get people suspicious.  I've found that sometimes mentioning the opposite concept helps remind people of what it's about, and associate it with the frustrations they bring, such as subjugation, helplessness
[01:10:13] <zleap> or the vi vs emacs thing acts as a barrier
[01:10:15] <arielcostas> gilq not every software respects freedom 0, there are many "personal use only" or with specific limitations unless you pay more. Freedom 1 makes people call it "open source"
[01:10:15] <ggoes> and then when they're more interested, we can refer them to the 4 freedoms and basic gnu writings
[01:10:25] <madage> I don't know exactly where the fear comes from but I think it is both the fear of a bunch of unknown people and the fear of hackers
[01:10:28] <ggoes> i agree lxo
[01:10:29] <Kelp> Even though I am not a programmer I can still appereciate and respect that free software allows for modifications and improvements
[01:10:29] <Avron62> madage: I think mailing list is the only thing accessible to non technical users, but then you need a list in a language that users are confident enough with, most people I talk to would not read a list in Englis

[01:12:21] <ggoes> if someone truly has never heard about free software, i think the ideal situation would just be introducing them to "gnu/linux" and "free software" and not explaining the terminology clashes, because when you've never heard of something before, having someone explain to you that many people call it something else would make a confusing thing even more confusing
[01:12:26] <Noisytoot> Kelp, Why are you sending spaces?
[01:12:28] <ggoes> they can be explained later
[01:12:36] <arielcostas> Kelp, most programming languages start indexing by zero, I guess it's that

[01:13:06] <zleap> one idea could be ask if a piece of software you really like has ever been withdrawn 
[01:13:09] <Kelp> Yep that's what causes it
[01:13:10] <gilq> tpefreedom: I would leave the privacy side of the matter apart from this to avoid confusion. People would reply on the same aforementioned famous line 
[01:13:13] <zleap> with free software this won't happen
[01:13:30] <Kelp> Like sketchup "free" that my dad used
[01:13:37] <Kelp> It's not replaced with their saas web browser app
[01:13:38] <zleap> or is there a feature you really want,  
[01:13:43] <Kelp> now*
[01:14:27] <gilq> Kelp that's a good example!
[01:14:27] <zleap> propriatary software companies have a tendancy to dictate if software is withdrawn 
[01:14:30] <zoe> Kelp: Yes! I worked with sketchup back in the day - that was really annoying 
[01:14:39] <ggoes> oh, i've never heard of sketchup
[01:14:59] <ggoes> i think using that situation as a way to introduce someone to the other evils of nonfree software would be good
[01:14:59] <Kelp> And since sketchup doesn't allow for redistribution, if they withdraw their web app then nobody can use it anymore
[01:15:06] <madage> ggoes: on that, I remember being confused when I first tried GNU because I could not understand at first why there was no binary install image on gnu.org
[01:15:08] <Kelp> All those plans you worked on in sketchup web are then gone
[01:15:16] <Kelp> So freedom to redistribute isn't worthless
[01:15:18] <ggoes> the only thing occuring to my mind right now is the flappy bird panic, but i'm sure there are better examples
[01:15:25] <zleap> maybe avoid evils, use perils
[01:15:27] <ggoes> oh that's interesting madage
[01:15:32] <madage> and why there where a lot of other sites with many names claiming all to be a gnu "distro"
[01:15:42] <ggoes> yeah, i like perils
[01:15:44] <gilq> ggoes we need also something a bit more popular than Sketchup (it was a 3D design program).
[01:15:46] <ggoes> yeah
[01:15:50] <Kelp> Flappy bird panic?
[01:16:04] <madage> that concept as opposed to what I was used which was a single OS from a single entity was at first intriguing
[01:16:10] <Kelp> OH ANOTHER THING. The backdoor for adobe disabling flash player.
[01:16:20] <Kelp> That wouldn't have happened if it was free software
[01:16:27] <ggoes> Kelp: there was an addictive nonfree iOS game a few years back called "flappy bird"; it was pulled by its developer and people literally started selling iPhones for thousdands of dollars on ebay just to be able to play it

[01:17:27] <Anon_> Oops
[01:17:30] <Kelp> They removed element?????
[01:18:03] <gilq> Kelp. I don't agree: it *is* free software, therefore people could redistribute it in some other ways
[01:18:23] <Noisytoot> gilq, Element isn't in the FSD, because I think it downloads software during build time
[01:18:26] <Noisytoot> so it may not be free
[01:18:31] <Kelp> Ah peah
[01:18:31] <zleap> but with Debian software is just available (as long as it is maintained) I don't think debian will remove something from a repositsory during lifetime of product

[01:18:39] <gilq> Noisytoot: I was speaking of the mastodon client.
[01:18:42] <zleap> if it will be out of the next release this is explained

[01:19:02] <zleap> Wasn't there a big fuss about MS removing paint from Windows
[01:19:07] <Noisytoot> gilq, I'm not sure if a mastodon client was removed, or zleap thought it was a mastodon client, but it was actually element

[01:20:47] <Kelp> It allows big tech to control you
[01:20:50] <zleap> so debian example, xfce4-notes is not in Debian 11,  
[01:20:50] <lxo> "what freedom means", as madage put it, is kind of different things to different people.  it has to do with what each person cares about, wishes to do, etc.  it reminds me of an article rms wrote about freedom, in which he gives examples of things you can do if you're not handcuffed.  what some of us value may be of little relevance to others, but only if software respects freedom can each one realize what matters
[01:20:56] <TheBlueWizard> To access Paint, just type Paint in search field
[01:20:59] <ggoes> yes bone-baboon; it's going to be difficult to address that. i think we should certainly explain it, and why they should avoid it, but that's more of an "advanced topic" for them. at least to me, it doesn't make sense to suggest someone using a nonfree OS avoid nonfree JS. that's something to tell them about when they're already using gnu/linux
[01:20:59] <Noisytoot> gilq, Element may be free, but it couldn't be reviewed
[01:21:01] <zleap> but we kinda know that from the repository database
[01:21:28] <arielcostas> zoe no, they are a Service as a Software Substitute (SaaSS), you download the binaries and need a subscription to run them IIRC
[01:21:40] <Noisytoot> With Guix, you could use guix time-machine to get old versions of software/software that is no longer in Guix

[01:22:49] <ggoes> i think something the ladder definitely needs is a clear progression rather than going off on a bunch of tangents. later steps can have "further reading" type components, but the principal thing is giving people an awareness of free software, getting them to replace a few nonfree programs they use, and get using gnu/linux
[01:23:07] <zoe> Ohhh right, still annoying ;) arielcostas 
[01:23:12] <zleap> ggoes, yes keep it simple
[01:23:14] <gilq> Kelp: I block *ALL* js: I found out that blocking only nonfree js broke more websites than blocking all js...
[01:23:19] <ggoes> there's so many applications to the free software philosophy that it can be overwhelming even for us in the community sometimes, haha
[01:23:31] <lxo> blocking js brings another angle I occasionally resort to: security.  if you don't have control over your computer, if you allow inauditable software to run on it, you're exposing yourself to many security threats
[01:23:48] <zleap> ggoes, and in some cases software names are hardly helpful
[01:24:01] <zleap> i think seahorse is the name for passwords and keys
[01:24:10] <tpefreedom> ggoes, I think we should split the last step into just trying/installing/using GNU/Linux and then switching to a 100% free system.
[01:24:19] <Noisytoot> zleap, If it used a generic name, it would conflict with lots of other software
[01:24:28] <zleap> Noisytoot, i know 
[01:24:30] <Noisytoot> I think it does use a generic name in the GNOME menu
[01:24:30] <Kelp> I showed my grandma GNU/Linux for like 5 minutes and then she already wanted it installed
[01:24:50] <tpefreedom> Kelp, what distro?
[01:24:51] <Kelp> The main reason people don't like GNU/Linux when they try it is because they chose the wrong distro
[01:24:53] <zleap> but you need to know to install seahorse
[01:24:58] <Kelp> Kubuntu tpefreedom
[01:25:09] <ggoes> yes tpefreedom i think that's what it was in our original drafts, so that's worth exploring
[01:25:11] <zleap> i am used to it,  what new users will make of that is anyones guess
[01:25:37] <ggoes> we need to make it clear that the end goal is a 100% free OS, but that a free OS with some nonfree components is an acceptable waypoint on your journey -- just don't stop there
[01:26:02] <ggoes> incremental steps are key
[01:26:07] <zleap> ggoes, and if we need to help people chose the right hardware for their next upgrade so they can use free software then we need to do that
[01:26:17] <ggoes> right; it would be a good way to plug ryf devices
[01:26:22] <arielcostas> ggoes some machines won't work with fully-free distros, if users can't get it to work smoothly they'll hate it and go back to losedows
[01:26:24] <zoe> isn't the goal just "more freedom" every step
[01:26:26] <zleap> however i think some of the laptops that are free software friendly are kinda expensive

[01:27:34] <tpefreedom> Noisytoot, you would have to do some hardware modifications. Also, it is still kinda old.
[01:27:37] <ggoes> we want to get someone trying gnu/linux as soon as they're ready, even if that means they're using a nonfree distro for a while. if they're properly motivated and aware of free software's importance, they're going to carry themselves to a 100% free distro anyway
[01:27:38] <lxo> a progression I used to perceive was: free apps, gnu/linux, blocking nonfree js, 100% free distro, free bios.  I wonder if nowadays we need to move the issues of js and saass ahead, so that users don't replace local proprietary apps with wwworst app store ones
[01:27:59] <ggoes> that's a good point lxo; we don't want them getting dependent on google docs as a way to make their switch to gnu/linux easier

[01:29:32] <lxo> arielcostas, as for machines not working with fully-free distros...  the advantage of presenting it as a ladder, as a progression, is that this can be understood and planned for.  if your current computer can't run a 100% distro, your ladder will have a step that involves replacing the computer, or at least components thereof
[01:29:48] <zleap> again you are asking people to save money on free (as in freedom software ) but then spend money on extra hardware
[01:30:00] <ggoes> right lxo, that's the plan
[01:30:01] <Kelp> But then that creates more ewaste if you replace your pc parts just to run free software

[01:30:13] <Kelp> The earth is all we have
[01:30:15] <gilq> ggoes: What about summing things up? I mean. Step 0: why free software matters. And I would cite some stories about some users that got damaged by running nonfree software (leaving the privacy aspect aside for a moment, so it's better if the stories do not cite this -- one problem at a time). Step 1: Propose some free alternatives, not only ethically better but also *technically better* (if the software does not
[01:30:18] <gilq> work properly people accept the risk). Step 3: make a sort of "timetable" I don't know... one replacement every X weeks. Step 4: try to replace the OS.
[01:30:32] <zoe> zleap Kelp +1
[01:30:36] <madage> I could maybe install a free bios on someone's computer if the hardware requirements allow

[01:31:35] <zoe> gilq: we can create resources to help with the transitions if we have enough time even
[01:31:37] <madage> it's not a show stopper, but this addiction to doing google docs, zoom meetings and using all sorts os web apps is something that has a higher resistance by some users I've successfully migrated to gnu

[01:31:53] <Kelp> I bought a refurbished phone a few weeks ago
[01:31:57] <ggoes> giving people that motivation that's going to carry them to the end is the most important part. because once we do that, they're going to guide themselves to a 100% free os/bios combination without much aid from us
[01:31:59] <Kelp> Flashed it with calyxos
[01:32:03] <ggoes> because they care about their freedom
[01:32:11] <Avron62> madage: to me, telling people to block JS makes little sense, what will make sense is when we will have software allowing to run your own installed JS instead of the one from the server,  some people are working on that now

[01:34:13] <ggoes> arielcostas: i don't think flashing libreboot is in the scope of the guide. an awareness of nonfree BIOSes, yes, but starting someone from 0 and getting them to flash a laptop with a breadboard is a little unrealistic
[01:34:13] <madage> but there's also a huge amount of peer pressure to use some SaaSS
[01:34:16] <zleap> gilq, that may not work with job interviews
[01:34:21] <ggoes> but we can certainly recommend retailers who provide librebooted computers already

[01:34:46] <zleap> i have zoom in a snap ( need to reinstall ) i do mention that, and that i do that for privacy reasons
[01:34:47] <ggoes> for their next purchase, in the sense lxo was talking about, being prepared to get one when your current computer does stop working
[01:34:47] <Kelp> What peer pressure madage?
[01:34:54] <zoe> i like that lxo -- I think making it "cool" for people to use their hardware as long as they possibly can would be a great way to get people to move to free software
[01:35:18] <Noisytoot> uninstalling zoom is better than reinstalling
[01:35:22] <zleap> extend working life of existing hardware without comproming productivity
[01:35:44] <Kelp> Speaking of which i need to dust off my pc owo
[01:35:46] <arielcostas> ggoes I meant more towards the end. Getting them to run GNU will be relatively easy with the release of Losedows 11 leaving many computers outdated, but an actual fully-free distro...
[01:35:48] <zleap> Noisytoot, like i said if you are invited to a job interview, via zoom it is that or nothing
[01:35:56] <gilq> vysn for me the motivation is that I like the freedom that comes with it: I know I have not to worry about license expiration or things like those. And if I want to change something or to study something... I can simply open the source code.
[01:36:05] <Noisytoot> I would just not work anywhere that uses zoom
[01:36:11] <ggoes> ah, i see
[01:36:11] <lxo> "<ggoes> giving people that motivation that's going to carry them to the end is the most important part" +10
[01:36:19] <ggoes> yeah, that's really the goal of the whole thing
[01:36:25] <Noisytoot> using the SaaSS version in a different firefox profile might be sandboxed better
[01:36:27] <ggoes> we help, but you really carry yourself along the journey
[01:36:32] <zleap> well hopefully interviews will go back to in person
[01:36:39] <Kelp> Posture check everyone (:
[01:36:51] <ggoes> haha thanks Kelp
[01:36:52] <Avron62> madage: I would also add to run installed client rather than using a web interface, even for services promoted as free software
[01:37:35] <Kelp> I installed the LBRY desktop app and it's literally just odysee lol
[01:37:40] <zleap> I have access to big blue button so if arranging to chat with people I send em a bbb link
[01:37:48] <Kelp> So sometimes using the web app makes sense
[01:37:55] <zleap> so far never had issues, also acts as icebreaker 
[01:37:56] <arielcostas> Kelp odysee is based on the old lbry.tv, isn't it?
[01:38:00] <zleap> to explain what it is
[01:38:05] <kompowiec> i was banned on skype. Maybe i should move to jitsi..
[01:38:15] <tpefreedom> Kelp, LBRY ~= odysee.
[01:38:25] <Noisytoot> kompowiec, move to Jitsi, BigBlueButton, or Jami
[01:38:33] <Kelp> meet.jit.si
[01:38:36] <Noisytoot> the FSF has a Jitsi server for members: jitsi.member.fsf.org
[01:38:47] <Kelp> but you have to pay for that server tho right?
[01:38:48] <zleap> Noisytoot, or all 3 so you give people choices depending on the situation
[01:38:55] <tpefreedom> Noisytoot, nice membership plug
[01:39:01] <Avron62> installing your own Jitsi is extremly easy
[01:39:08] <zleap> Kelp, for bbb, no i know the person who runs the server :)
[01:39:10] <Kelp> Send a guide for it Avron62
[01:39:14] <kompowiec> yeah but enjoy convince all 44 people to change IM :(
[01:39:31] <kompowiec> convos.chat it's fine too
[01:39:32] <Noisytoot> Kelp, You have to have an FSF membership: https://my.fsf.org/join?referrer=3244096
[01:40:05] <ggoes> to create a room, yes
[01:40:05] <Kelp> hehe referrer
[01:40:05] <zleap> i reinstalled mumble earlier
[01:40:16] <ggoes> but you can join a room someone else creates without being a member
[01:40:18] <gilq> kompowiec if those 44 people are your friends, than they should understand it. If not, *at least* the fact that you've been banned should make them move!
[01:40:31] <madage> Avron62: agreed
[01:40:45] <madage> Kelp: pressure from peers who use those services?
[01:40:52] <arielcostas> kompowiec every time there's downtime or they complain about something propose the change
[01:40:58] <kompowiec> tbh I would like only two people at least.
[01:41:02] <zleap> IIRC bbb is used by the US dept of defence, some unis in hte US have apparently banned zoom
[01:41:07] <kompowiec> maybe 3
[01:41:11] <Avron62> Kelp: https://jitsi.github.io/handbook/docs/devops-guide/devops-guide-quickstart
[01:41:20] <vysn> zleap: how sustainable is that? surly you can create something in your spare time and give it away for free. given that for the majority of your time you are busy  working for a living .therefore you can't realistically dedicate the time necessary to innovate and create exceptional software that is useful in everyday life.  
[01:41:23] <Kelp> Zoom is banned in germany i think
[01:41:36] <madage> eg. once I was trying to organize a trip with some friends and one of the first things someone did was to create a google spreadsheet or something so we could all edit online
[01:41:46] <kompowiec> although I agree with this completely, it is the only method. gilq:

[01:42:06] <zleap> if people want to use it, they can
[01:42:44] <kompowiec> i wonder what next, maybe i get ban on a google lol
[01:43:01] <Kelp> How do you get banned from skype??
[01:43:09] <kompowiec> i just send some memes
[01:43:22] <kompowiec> and then look, it logged me out
[01:43:36] <kompowiec> and says that account it's blocked
[01:43:54] <Kelp> Does anyone even use skype anymore?
[01:43:56] <kompowiec> Strangely enough, I didn't throw them into conferences, but at DM.

[01:44:16] <gilq> But it's not a topic for a freedom ladder for the users...
[01:44:18] <Kelp> But people can just take that free software and distribute it for free
[01:44:20] <arielcostas> Kelp many use teams, same sh*t with different name
[01:44:22] <lxo> cool.  can we add getting banned from proprietary stuff into the freedom ladder somehow? :-D
[01:44:29] <ggoes> hahaha
[01:44:29] <kompowiec> i used skype from the very beginning. and I did not change it because it was quite universal.
[01:44:32] <Kelp> Free software isn't compatible with capitalism
[01:44:51] <Noisytoot> Kelp, You can sell free software
[01:45:04] <Kelp> But others can take that business away from you tho
[01:45:14] <arielcostas> Kelp it is, it's not with surveillance capitalism
[01:45:15] <Kelp> Caause they can take that free software you are selling then distributie it for free
[01:45:25] <kompowiec> comparing free software with capitalism vs. communism it's cancer.
[01:45:37] <lxo> Kelp, careful there.  we don't want to scare away people who've been misled into believing that capitalism is good and anything else is horrible
[01:45:38] <kompowiec> it's like comparing the 2D world to the 3D world
[01:45:41] <zleap> but you could make install media and sell that, + also sell services to supoort it
[01:45:55] <Kelp> But what if you want to sell the software itself?
[01:45:58] <zleap> so you are not just saying install tjis and get on wit it,  you can offer to help support 
[01:45:58] <Kelp> You are screwed then
[01:46:11] <vysn> Kelp: exactly: once an idea is proven to be working and profitable. everyone one and their cat will fork your code and resell it. again this does not seem sustainable.

[01:47:57] <Guest5395> I joined this chat at about 16:34 and I've got a copy of some sections of the conversation. How can I get a full copy of everything that was said since 16:00?
[01:48:18] *** Quits: Anon_ (~user@2a06:1700:0:b::44cb:6f) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[01:48:22] <madage> on the motivation part, I think what lxo and zoe said is a good example... saying to people that can use their devices longer with free software also appeals to people who are concious about the environment or about planned obsolecence
[01:48:24] <Kelp> Oof sorry Guest5395
[01:48:30] <Kelp> If I can figure out how I can export the logs
[01:48:51] <madage> this I think is a good way to attract people, to show them how they can do better on their activism with free software
[01:49:05] <zoe> madage: +1
[01:49:15] <ggoes> on the subject of nonfree services, though, one part of one step might be an exercise to refuse a zoom call etc a single time; as in https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/saying-no-even-once.html
[01:49:18] <ggoes> yes madage i agree
[01:49:40] <ggoes> avoiding hardware obsolescence / the ecology component is definitely strong enough to serve as someone's motivation, i think
[01:49:48] <zleap> ggoes, the issue there is job interviews will just move to the next candidate
[01:50:01] <corwin> Guest5395: logs since 10 minutes prior to start time: https://bpa.st/YDEQ

[01:51:10] <zleap> however if I install zoom in a snap it is containerised (which is kinda complex as it is) so does allow me to say that i don't trust zoom but this for me makes it safer
[01:51:19] <Guest5395> corwin: Thank you
[01:51:29] <kompowiec> the problem is people don't care about free software. and are highly susceptible to piracy-to-theft propaganda.
[01:51:52] <Avron62> sorry, I have mixed about saying free software avoids hardware obsolescence, I am not sure how true that argument really is, 
[01:51:58] <madage> just to add an example, on the feminist part, there has been some news recently saying that facebook employees used their access to other peoples data to harass women

[01:52:33] <zleap> however new hardwre is aslo more energy efficient
[01:52:47] <vysn> the mechanisms that are in place now like  IP, copy right, proprietary etc are there because they simply work and benefit creators,
[01:52:49] <lxo> zleap, running it in a container may bring yourself some peace of mind, as much as you trust the containing technology, but it really makes no significant difference freedom-wise, nor as to what you convey to others, IMHO
[01:52:51] <zleap> but as long as old hardware is recycled properly there is less of an issue
[01:53:05] <zleap> lxo, yeah
[01:53:07] <lxo> if you really must join a zoom call, I'm told it's doable with jami
[01:53:13] <Guest5395> kelp: thank you that's better.
[01:53:24] <zleap> well that needs investigating
[01:53:29] <zleap> thanks
[01:53:33] <Noisytoot> lxo, I think it's only if whoever hosts the meeting pays for it
[01:53:37] <gilq> madage: I know about a video pro right to repair that comments about some apple certified technicians who leaked private photos of a woman who brought her device to them for repair.
[01:53:39] <ggoes> zoe:  encryption is something we talk about more specifically in a later step, but i'm wondering if it's worth including early on, as something to pitch to a person who's already security conscious

[01:54:15] <corwin> Did I have the start time wrong?  I only went back an hour.  Should I have gone back 1h 23m?

[01:54:23] <ggoes> corwin: it started at 16:00 edt
[01:54:31] <corwin> EDT!  ty ggoes
[01:54:34] <zleap> it works both ways if you arrange a job interview with me (candidate) you ca use zoom, if on the other hand I want to discuss something e.g possible work / collaboration then I will send you a bbbb link
[01:54:34] <ggoes> but there was some chat before that
[01:54:36] <gilq> One other thing I would do is to make short videos about the problem. Not only technical aspects, but also short documentaries about the difference between free and nonfree software
[01:55:04] <lxo> http://people.skolelinux.org/pere/blog/Jami_as_a_Zoom_client__a_trick_for_password_protected_rooms___.html
[01:55:30] <zoe> well i think ggoes that we can def talk about people who want more privacy, or avoid surveillance as a reason to opt for freer programs and use encryption - i think for sure it can be a reason
[01:55:36] <zleap> that could be useful, thanks
[01:55:41] <ggoes> right, if someone's already thinking along those lines
[01:55:47] <ggoes> gilq: yeah, i like that
[01:55:48] <Noisytoot> "The Jami daemon leak memory like crazy (approximately 1 GiB a minute) when I am connected to the video conference"
[01:55:51] <Noisytoot> That's very bad
[01:56:04] <Noisytoot> It would mean I would have to restart every 4-8 minutes
[01:56:08] <Noisytoot> (restart Jami)
[01:56:08] <madage> gilq: I saw that, this would be a good point to make when teaching people about encryption software
[01:56:25] <madage> as just running free software woudn't have helped
[01:56:33] <ggoes> we're hoping to dovetail the ladder into other practical resources we have, like the email self-defense guide and RYF database
[01:56:45] <zleap> well 1 + for bbb / jitsi is meets can be as long as you want
[01:56:51] <ggoes> ideally the steps will flow naturally into different, existing resources we have
[01:56:52] <zleap> with zoom oyu pay if over 45 mins
[01:57:11] <lxo> but I hope it goes without saying (but I'll say anyway :-) that, even having a workaround, it's generally better practice to steer people away from walled gardens like zoom
[01:57:17] <zoe> All i would love to hear arguments to the environmental positives and negatives of free software. In the end i rtend to believe that it is always better to use something that already exists than something that is made (esp. with finite resources), but I would love to hear more about this 
[01:57:21] <Kelp> Guest5395 in case you missed... https://privatebin.net/?6e08952b858253c1#Mzj6ggMMyg8owd4YS3KF9SRXeDBWBdytyXpk5srZrRr
[01:57:25] <gilq> Noisytoot: I have some problems managing to run Jami... but when I used it it was not the case... :thinks:
[01:57:41] <Kelp> Jami is horrible 
[01:57:50] <Kelp> Didn't work for me and my dad
[01:58:09] <Noisytoot> gilq, That was also not the case when I ran it (I'm quoting from the article lxo sent), but I didn't use it as a SIP client/to join Zoom meetings
[01:58:12] <lxo> Noisytoot, yeah, leaking 1GB per second is surely a bug that someone interested in making it work could devote oneself to fixing
[01:58:20] <Noisytoot> Kelp, It worked for me
[01:58:21] <vysn> unless you can come up with a clear mechanism for free software to compete with proprietary profits, free software will continue to be unsustainable and  pipedream and a fantasy 
[01:58:30] <Noisytoot> lxo, per minute, not per second
[01:58:43] <zleap> zoe, i think the requirements for some of the linux routers are really low spec computers, so in that sense you can run a pfsense box on really old hardware and it just works
[01:58:47] <tpefreedom> zoe, IMO used/refurbished is generally better.
[01:58:50] <Noisytoot> if it was per second, it would be completely unusable (have to restart every 4-8 seconds)
[01:58:57] <bone-baboon> Kelp: Reducing the video resolution in Jami can help to make calls work.
[01:59:12] <Kelp> No I mean it would not run in the background on my dads ios device
[01:59:15] <gilq> Noisytoot: but I admit Jami has some serious issues on my side. And that's a pity because the idea is amazing to say the least
[01:59:24] <Kelp> so it never worked at all for us
[01:59:36] <Guest5395> kelp: Thank you.  I'm trying to copy as much as possible before the kittens die. But I'm quite clumsy and doing things fast makes it worse.
[01:59:45] <Kelp> Why does jami even exist if there is briar?
[02:00:00] <Noisytoot> When I tried Jami initially, it didn't work (I tried to call myself, I recieved the call 2 days later), but when I tried it again (I think about 1 year later), it worked
[02:00:01] <Kelp> Lmao
[02:00:04] <lxo> it's unlikely to be a high priority for most people though: most will either prefer to avoid zoom entirely, or give up freedom and use the proprietary interfaces.  it takes someone motivated enough to want to connect to zoom, but not willing to run its software, to look into this ;-)  freedom makes for diverse interests
[02:00:35] <Kelp> brb
[02:00:35] <gilq> vysn: counterexample: Linux.
[02:00:51] <gilq> And that's only the most evident one
[02:01:11] <zleap> i will avoid zoom if possible
[02:01:24] <zleap> like i said I can join your zoom, if I arrange the meeting I call the shots
[02:01:28] <lxo> Kelp, why does briar even exist if there is jami ;-)
[02:01:30] <gilq> lxo that's why I proposed to start with free programs that work as is, without thinkering too much with them to start with.
[02:01:43] <gilq> Otherwise people get discouraged
[02:01:47] <ggoes> the discussion has been great, everybody, so much that we took it out an extra half hour. :) i'll still be following the discussion a little more loosely though; be sure to leave any suggestions you have on the lp wiki discussion page https://libreplanet.org/wiki/Group:Freedom_Ladder and join us for next week's meeting on the "finding free replacements" step https://www.fsf.org/events/freedomladder-20210722-irc
[02:02:11] <ggoes> it's been a lot of fun and i think we're off to a good start
[02:02:15] <zoe> We'll also work through the notes we made and add them to the pages, you can then also comment on those! 
[02:02:18] <lxo> gilq, sure, sorry about the tangent of offering a workaround for an expressed need
[02:02:22] <zleap> are these discussions going to be typed up 
[02:02:31] <madage> zoe: from the top of my head I cannot think of a negative of free software for the environment, but I would say that if many people want hardware which is compatible with a fully free OS, the prices for those would go up, as there aren't many
[02:02:36] <zleap> to answer that - yes
[02:03:02] <madage> but in that case it would also create market pressure for other companies to free their hardware designs
[02:03:29] <lxo> madage, demand would drive suppliers who often say there's no demand to reconsider.  it would be a happy outcome

[02:04:01] <gilq> lxo I saved your link. For users that cares a lot about freedom it's very important. For novices... it scares them. But maybe it would be great to add this at the end of the ladder as an appendix

[02:04:14] <Kelp> s/meeting/meetings
[02:04:25] <zleap> we need to ask shops if they sell hardware that will run linux, small shops are more likey to be helpful in that respect
[02:04:36] <ggoes> Kelp: it's all good; leave discussion on wiki or email us at campaigns@fsf.org, we're collecting feedback/thoughts in a number of different ways

[02:06:02] <Guest5395> kelp: I regret that
[02:06:06] <kompowiec> jami is fine but... it's p2p
[02:06:19] <kompowiec> and it's main drawback
[02:06:23] <Kelp> Regret what Guest5395?
[02:06:34] <lxo> kompowiec, IMHO being p2p is a strength, not a weakness
[02:06:36] <kompowiec> good luck deal with NAT
[02:06:37] <zoe> We'll try to work the notes into here for now: https://libreplanet.org/wiki/Group:Freedom_Ladder def before the next meeting, hopefully in the next few days!
[02:06:53] <zleap> ok
[02:06:56] <gilq> lxo yeah, of course the easiest solution (avoid it) is also the best one
[02:07:03] <lxo> it works great for me, and that's behind two or three layers of NAT :_)
[02:07:15] <kompowiec> but it use TURN i guess?
[02:07:19] <zleap> I am sure most hardware is fine with free software anyway
[02:07:21] <gilq> kompowiec that's not a bug, it's a feature!
[02:07:35] <kompowiec> if yes, it miss the whole point
[02:07:36] <Guest5395> kelp: Not being able to count with your help. 
[02:07:41] <zleap> you can read the spec just avoid say nvidia as there are freedom respecting alternatives
[02:07:55] <zleap> we should also give praise / credit to those who get it right
[02:08:15] <kompowiec> I would suggest XMPP to people if there was a good client like AstraChat.
[02:08:49] <Guest5395> if I still haven't been able to overcome my uefi problems
[02:08:58] <madage> I've been successful with Conversations for android and Siskin for iOS users
[02:09:23] <Guest5395> that have forced me to leave Trisquel and use Ubuntu
[02:09:38] <kompowiec> yeah but you know, normies want audio/video. And this not working as i expected
[02:09:54] <Kelp> None of my friends use audio or video chat with me
[02:10:03] <madage> with Jami I've had some success, but with some iOS users it sometimes failed and I could not solve
[02:10:11] <Kelp> Yeah
[02:10:16] <Kelp> And element is like the other way around
[02:10:24] <Kelp> notifications only work well on ios
[02:10:24] <madage> but with swarm chat comming I'm hopeful it will be better
[02:10:25] <kompowiec> tbh i also avoid it, that's why i only use skype for this purpose.
[02:11:17] <gilq> madage I can't wait for that feature to be implemented!
[02:11:20] <kompowiec> I can't stand it anymore, I have to go to sleep, good night.
[02:11:24] <Kelp> Try signal if you haven't already
[02:11:34] <Kelp> Goodnight kompowiec
[02:11:37] <gilq> kompowiec goodnight
[02:12:00] <Noisytoot> Kelp, Signal is centralized and depends on phone numbers
[02:12:06] <Noisytoot> Use XMPP
[02:12:22] <zleap> nite
[02:12:26] <Kelp> XMPP is not friendly to new users
[02:13:10] <zleap> i think mint do a good job providing a link to their irc channel for support
[02:13:21] <zleap> if we could get that in to more distros it may help people

[02:18:19] <zleap> i find being non contactable quite nice
[02:18:33] <zleap> have land line, answer phone and e-mail
[02:18:35] <zoe> Guest5395: sure! That is fine, I've been a bit flaky with being online here, but i'll be more repsonsible, so you can ping me :) 
[02:18:57] <TheBlueWizard> A lot of my friends insist I get a mobile...and at least one friend already cut me out because of my refusal to buy iPhone or Android. They simply could not understand why I refused to do so, and I have a hard time explaining why

[02:20:25] <zleap> TheBlueWizard, on the other hand, if an employer says I need a phone for work, they should supply it as a work phone
[02:20:32] <gilq> zleap I wish I could install Trisquel just by touching people's computer :D (just joking of course)

[02:21:53] <Kelp> Guest5395 seems based
[02:21:54] <TheBlueWizard> zleap: I am talking about personal phones. Work phones are a separate matter. It's OKAY for me to use it provided the employer provide it for work purpose (by the way I also don't have work mobile LOL)
[02:22:12] <zleap> i got that
[02:22:19] <zleap> i don't have a mobile either
[02:22:37] <Kelp> Ima ditch my phone when I can 
[02:22:46] <zleap> partly as I had one, ran out of funds, umable to top up and due to pandemic unable to get to shop to ask for help
[02:23:04] <Kelp> Once I no longer live in my mom and dads house I'm getting rid of the phone 
[02:23:04] <zoe> Guest5395: sure! you can /query zoe in irc to basically dm me :) 
[02:23:05] <zleap> got cryptic messages about stuff, which I didn'treally know how to respond to
[02:23:06] <Kelp> They can xmpp me
[02:23:27] <zleap> if I get a phone i want a pinepone + mastodon client etc

[02:23:40] <Guest5395> dm ?
[02:23:59] <corwin> Direct Message (private message)
[02:24:39] <gilq> Sorry for the stupid question, but is there a command to issue in order to express feelings just like some people does (the last one being "TheBlueWizard thinks he is slowly going nuts as a result")
[02:24:44] <zoe> thanks corwin yep directly message me, I am not sure how you are connecting Guest5395, but otherwise you can also email me and we can set up a call if you prefer! 
[02:24:56] <Guest5395> ok. I'll try that on this webchat client I'm being forced to use
[02:25:10] <Kelp> You can use any IRC client you want Guest5395 (:
[02:25:16] <gilq> Guest5395 why forced?
[02:25:18] <Kelp> The fsf would never lock you in
[02:25:42] <corwin> gilq: I think you want CTCP action, /me does something, e.g. 
[02:25:45] * corwin does something
[02:25:54] * Kelp does something
[02:26:02] <gilq> Thanks corwin. Let me try
[02:26:05] <zleap> https://www.dcglug.org.uk/ < has some basic tutorials on connecting hexchat to freenode (irc)
[02:26:22] * gilq do something
[02:26:26] * gilq does something
[02:26:31] <gilq> Hey, thanks! :)
[02:26:32] <Guest5395> Because I had to change from a uefi free hardware to a uefi compliant hardware and I dont't know how to use Trisquel with my new uefi compliant hardware
[02:26:38] <corwin> :D
[02:27:52] <zleap> i think by default weblinks to irc open up in mibbit 
[02:28:26] <Guest5395> Perhaps I could PM on Hexchat because that was the client I used to use with Trisquel. But I dont't know if I wil be able to use it with this webchat I am currently using on Ubuntu
[02:28:48] <corwin> Hexchat should work fine on Ubuntu
[02:28:57] <zleap> yeah
[02:28:58] <Kelp> +1
[02:29:08] <zleap> sudo apt install hexchat
[02:29:23] <zleap> or use the software store thingy
[02:31:22] <Guest5395> OK I'll keep that in mind. Did you understand when will zoe be availabe for the chat I have in mind?
[02:31:50] <lxo> "Kelp> XMPP is not friendly to new users"  I don't see how that makes sense.  XMPP is a protocol specification.  it's almost like saying that the number 42 is not friendly to new users.  I think you mean you don't consider the XMPP-implementing apps you know friendly to new users.  but even that assessment is not so good in that it's not actionable.  better unpack.  and then realize that "new users" are quite diverse is expectations and needs
[02:31:53] <Noisytoot> the dcglug.org.uk tutorials should be changed to libera
[02:32:45] <zleap> ok
[02:32:53] <zleap> i can just change the text
[02:33:01] <zleap> rather than all the screenshots

The pull request commit removes the questionable files. A maintainer of cowsay responded requesting feedback. <https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/guix-devel/2021-07/msg00094.html> It was also suggested that the questionable files could be an issue with the GLP license

[20:51:33] <donald> they're viewing as an issue of whether they get done up over it, rather than an issue about trying to make sure all the licensing is good

[21:23:20] <tpefreedom> How would you license a game running on a separately available game engine (like godot)?
[21:24:00] <tpefreedom> Would the engine's license(s) apply to any files created w/ that engine? Do the game files need to be manually given a free license?
[21:24:10] <kompowiec2__> I tried freenix oncs time and i remember that i cant compile broadcom wifi drivers :p
[21:24:17] <kompowiec2__> So its probably legit

[21:30:45] <bone-baboon> donald: If those two cowsay repositories (apparently maintained by the same person) do not address the questionable files then what would you suggest is the next step? craigt had suggested changing the link to a cowsay repository that does not have the files for the FSD cowsay article. Those appear to be the two predominant cowsay repositories. I did not find a cowsay repository without the files.

[21:51:02] <donald> bone-baboon: i think the cowsay person isn't saying that cowsay can only be used non-commercially, but rather that their use of the logos is noncommercial
[21:51:21] <IShare_Freedom> the entries always must be in english or i can put in spanish too?

[22:11:52] <monkwitdafunk> does everyone think cineplex odeon uses a run from ram linux OS with a proprietary patch to mplayer?

[22:14:56] <Noisytoot> monkwitdafunk, you can get an fsf/member/* cloak by emailing membership@fsf.org, or a user/* cloak by joining #libera-cloak and say !cloakme
[22:15:20] <monkwitdafunk> yes! thank you Noisytoot
[22:15:50] <monkwitdafunk> being a FSF associate member is like wearing blue jeans that make me cool. haha
[22:16:09] <Noisytoot> is it possible to get an fsf/member double cloak?
[22:16:16] <Noisytoot> as I already have an affiliated cloak

[22:25:14] <bone-baboon> David_Hedlund: I saw your message about testing the FSD with text based browsers and mediawiki-el. <https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/directory-discuss/2021-07/msg00019.html>
[22:25:15] <donald> if you're just joining us, say hello and check out the participation guide at https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Free_Software_Directory:Participate
[22:25:51] <David_Hedlund> bone-baboon: I just evaluated Lynx, see the result a few lines up.
[22:26:20] <David_Hedlund> Correct (bytes, not kb): Lynx can only add 13473 bytes (13473 characters) in the textarea form for pages at the wiki. For 13474 bytes (13474 characters) lynx reads: "HTTP request sent; waiting for response.", after 5 minutes it reads "Sorry! We could not process your edit due to a loss of session data."
[22:26:25] <monkwitdafunk> bone-baboon: speaking of text based browsers, i used one bac in grade 7 on an amiga machine. i was so smart with it but i cant remember how i did it so well
[22:26:55] <David_Hedlund> bone-baboon: I'm putting the results at https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Collection_talk:Text_mode_browsers,_and_IceCat_WebExtensions_for_text_editors
[22:27:32] <David_Hedlund> bone-baboon: Do you want to help me evaluate more browsers?
[22:27:39] <bone-baboon> David_Hedlund: I just tried signing into the FSD with EWW with <https://directory.fsf.org/wiki?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Main+Page>. I am unable to sign in and it redirects me to a sign in page <https://cas.fsf.org/login>.

[22:36:58] <zleap> has freenode disabled SASL authentication ? SASL authentication failed
[22:37:17] <zleap> i just get that endlessly on the freenode server tab
[22:37:42] <Noisytoot> zleap, freenode or libera?
[22:37:44] <Noisytoot> this is libera
[22:38:00] <Noisytoot> freenode wiped their account database, so you'll need to recreate your account
[22:38:07] <zleap> freenode
[22:38:15] <zleap> ah ok
[22:38:35] <Noisytoot> rasengan suddenly decided to move to InspIRCd and Anope to "drain the swamp"

[22:39:15] <David_Hedlund> bone-baboon: "I could also look into setting up mediawiki-el so I can test the FSD with it." -- yes, it would be very very helpful if you would like to test all emacs solutions and document them at https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Collection_talk:Text_mode_browsers,_and_IceCat_WebExtensions_for_text_editors

[23:02:25] <monkwitdafunk> but when i am ready to participate with the h-node database i will
[23:03:26] <monkwitdafunk> i find it hard to run guix toram, and have proteanOS in front of it, all on mobile hardware that charges with usb-c
[23:04:04] <Noisytoot> What do you mean?
[23:04:20] <Noisytoot> ProteanOS is something different
[23:04:32] <bone-baboon> donald: I am going to send a friendly ping to the FIGlet email.
[23:04:34] <Noisytoot> and I don't think the charging method is relevant
[23:04:59] <monkwitdafunk> i thought proteanOS was used as a a hardware firewall

[23:16:41] <panosalevro> add*
[23:17:24] <monkwitdafunk> okay. im off to get some fresh ait. i feel too hot
[23:18:22] <bugweiser> I wonder why we make this licensing stuff so amazingly difficult..
[23:19:00] <donald> panosalevro: if it's still available in source form it can be added, as long as it can still be built on like trisquel it can still be useful
[23:19:00] <bugweiser> I mean, why not put `(c) 2021 John Doe <john@doe.com> All rights reserved` on the top of our files.
[23:19:22] <bugweiser> and then somewhere in a fac we just write in human language that you are free to modify etc..
[23:19:31] <panosalevro> donald: alright, i will add both the discontinued version and the new one. they are separate projects anyway
[23:19:35] <bugweiser> no legal language, no warranty disclaimers, just a simple entry in the faq.
[23:19:38] <bone-baboon> donald: Oh now I see what you mean. I had not seen tnalpgge's response on that cowsay pull request until just now. In my previous message I was refering to what apjanke had said.
[23:19:44] <bugweiser> after all, FSF does the exact same it appears...
[23:19:53] <donald> panosalevro: ah, so like there is a newer version? i was misunderstanding
[23:20:07] <donald> panosalevro: we want the latest version on the directory
[23:20:10] <Noisytoot> donald, Why Trisquel specifically?
[23:20:26] <panosalevro> donald: kind of. theres TinyXML and TinyXML-2
[23:20:48] <panosalevro> but some projects still use TInyXML, although TInyXML-2 is newer
[23:20:55] <panosalevro> so i think i should add both
[23:20:58] <bugweiser> why doesn't the FSF help developers and tell them the above is sufficient?

[23:42:49] <bugweiser> it appears a little less 'user friendly' from my simple perspective to check a website if I i'm not accidentally interrupting a meeting when I'd want to ask a question.
[23:44:05] <bugweiser> anywho.. regarding my question, just granting rights to modify etc. hidden in some faq is sufficient licensing from a legal perspective, no?
