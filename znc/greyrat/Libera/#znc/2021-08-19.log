[02:04:05] <DoctorD90> TLS 1.3 is supported?
[02:04:43] <MetaNova> [[Configuration]]
[02:04:44] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/Configuration
[02:04:49] <DarthGandalf> to an extent
[02:05:16] <DarthGandalf> there's still no way to disable it
[02:06:08] <DoctorD90> MetaNova, I was looking on it and I didnt saw 1.3 :P 
[02:06:22] <DoctorD90> DarthGandalf, what do you mean? You would like to disable 1.3?
[02:06:38] <JAVA_THE_HUT> dafuq
[02:06:47] <JAVA_THE_HUT> TLS 1.3 should be enabled and the only protocol enabled
[02:06:59] <JAVA_THE_HUT> SSL should be disabled entirely
[02:07:11] <JAVA_THE_HUT> as well as TLS 1.0
[02:07:22] <JAVA_THE_HUT> 1.1 and 1.2 are ok I guess, but that should be disabled as well
[02:09:27] <DoctorD90> in reality only TLS 1.2 and 1.3 should be kept :P but...I dont think there are people focussed on security that are so paranoid to use znc to exchange private information :P so I dont think it is a so big issue :D
[02:10:00] <DoctorD90> btw currently 1.3 is the most secure....I was appointing it in the Hardening guide but I didnt see in the Configuration page

[02:17:17] <MetaNova> I believe the example for SSLProtocols on the Configuration page is the default behavior if not otherwise specified
[02:17:22] <MetaNova> SSLProtocols = -SSLv2 -SSLv3 -TLSv1 +TLSv1.1 +TLSv1.2
[02:18:09] <MetaNova> with TLSv1.3 being accepted, but not a valid option, it sounds like
[02:20:32] <DoctorD90> MetaNova, I perfectly agree...it sound like this to me. Moreover, TLSv1.0, TLSv1.1 should also be blocked (but this would decrease the compatibility)(but in 2020 I hope most of the IRC Client still alive has updated their security feature)
[02:22:31] <MetaNova> DoctorD90: how comprehensive do you plan on making the Hardening guide? are you going to include things like Allow =, certauth + AuthOnlyViaModule True, firewall rules?
[02:22:42] <DoctorD90> currently only TLS1.2 and 1.3 are "safe"...even if DarthGandalf has putted an insect in my ears and searching I find out a possible vulnerability for 1.3 in certain cases...So Im checking the minimum configuration for TLS1.2 and TLS1.3 to find a way (but im too tired at this time xD ahahah)
[02:23:49] <DoctorD90> well....firewall rules join the server admin domain....it would be a little overshooting for the ZNC wiki...otherwise I should start also how to configure the security of the server....
[02:24:38] <DoctorD90> about the hardening, Im checking the configuration, I will talk about implementing SSL on both side (client-znc and znc-server) and investing time on module setup
[02:25:16] <DoctorD90> with some brackets on paranoid setup (something like if you have to manage your entire private life over znc ahaha)
[02:25:29] <MetaNova> without going into too much detail, you can better cover the overall subject by mentioning that if you're concerned about security, you really ought to be running an implicit-deny firewall and would need to specifically open any ports you intended to have ZNC listen on
[02:26:14] <DoctorD90> well....if you think this will not go over ZNC's wiki interest...why not
[02:27:04] <DoctorD90> currently on my machine only the ssh is opened. All other are opened on time based after the command via SSH (strictly authendticaed via pki XD)
[02:27:17] <DoctorD90> time based per IP*
[02:28:21] <DoctorD90> maybe I could share also the eggdrop znc manager I did to manage ZNC paid service if you want ahahahah...
[02:29:06] <MetaNova> while I personally would find no immediate value from this, I'm actually quite confident a number of people would be /very interested/ to see it
[02:29:07] <DoctorD90> even if probably the entire PayPal side should be written again from scratch and updated with 1.7 commands
[02:30:12] <DoctorD90> ahahah Im rpetty sure of this....at that stage of my life (2010) some people tried to steal it and use it cause it was staff-less... totally automated in main features...
[02:30:52] <DoctorD90> well, if it is in my roadmap to share all my old eggdrop scripts, so one day I will do :D
[02:31:16] <DoctorD90> currently I wanna close the znc bracket xD it is open by 1 year ahahah

[03:42:47] <fred> is there a way to keep the 'znc-clock' synced regardless of the host time in which znc is running?
[03:43:02] <fred> *is there a way to keep the 'znc-clock' synced regardless of the host time on which znc is running?
[03:44:10] <MetaNova> the best solution to that is simply use clients which support server-time
[03:44:28] <DoctorD90> fred in the webadmin, your settings, should be there under ZNC Behaviour the settings for the timezone
[03:44:53] <DoctorD90> Just put a datetime allowed format
[03:45:01] <DoctorD90> It works from my side :)
[03:45:41] <fred> YEP DoctorD90 - BUT THAT TIMEZONE RELIES ON THE HOST TIME, SINCE IT SIMPLY +/- FROM THAT
[03:45:46] <fred> ups - sry
[03:47:28] <DoctorD90> ehm....so? ...Sorry i dont fully understand. Scenario A) the host has time misconfigured > play with the znc timezone to cover the gap, Scenario B) the machine has time totally misconfigured and 'it likes to change' randomly....ask to the server admin to fix it :)
[03:47:59] <DoctorD90> MetaNova, DarthGandalf uhm... I think I find out a little mistake probably. In [[Configuration]] there is the referial to "Mozilla's recomendations" but probably they updated it. Cause running that ciphers I got many unwanted ciphers and there are neither listed on the Mozilla's page :P
[03:47:59] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/Configuration

[04:11:51] <fred> nvm
[04:12:58] <DoctorD90> fred they are secure, you are just excluding the TLSv1.3
[04:13:23] <DoctorD90> 'secure'...it is a big word but...meh...I hope you got me
[04:14:38] <DoctorD90> and thanks for the tool :) i already knew it. Im just looking at current good tls1.2 and tls1.3 from openssl + some google search for new vulnerabilities :)
[04:15:02] <fred> i compile znc against libressl
[04:15:12] <fred> maybe you should check that also
[04:16:07] <DoctorD90> meh....too much work xD
[04:16:25] <DoctorD90> theoretically only the name should change
[04:16:51] <DoctorD90> and for the translation im using a nice site: https://ciphersuite.info/cs/
[04:17:09] <fred> no - it isnt
[04:17:28] <DoctorD90> Im used to openssl so just going trough its to retrieve info I need and in the case I convert the name with it
[04:17:29] <fred> ./configure/make libressl with --prefix=$HOME and then ./configure znc with CXXFLAGS=-I$HOME/include LDFLAGS=-L$HOME/lib --prefix=$HOME
[04:18:08] <fred> so everything stays in the users $HOME
[04:18:43] <DoctorD90> ok but why should I install znc with libressl support? XD I didnt get the point..sorry I really tired :D

[05:38:23] <predicament> ^ just an example and that's what /msg *cert info will show you
[05:39:28] <MetaNova> predicament: the first is the file ZNC uses to enable listening ports to use SSL
[05:39:44] <MetaNova> the latter is the certificate ZNC offers to the Libera-Chat network
[05:40:23] <MetaNova> they are not used for the same thing, are not constructed the same way, and neither takes precedence over the other
[05:41:48] <predicament> okay..
[05:42:07] <predicament> that's actually the certificate i generated myself for it yeah
[05:42:24] <predicament> znc.pem is another one entirely
[05:42:36] <predicament> i'm probably confusing some stuff right now
[05:43:01] <predicament> someone said that i had it set up wrong but at that time i at least had something that gave me a client fingerprint no matter what the damn setup was.
[05:44:14] <predicament> im seriously inept or something, i had it and then i screwed it up.  the original thought was just to try an auto-login with hexchat to my znc that i'm in a perpetual use of fucking up
[05:44:17] <predicament> so.
[05:45:02] <MetaNova> what are you trying to do?
[05:46:20] <predicament> i'm trying to at least get my znc to recognize a fingerprint.  i might even have the wrong key added.  i followed the guide to a T and i'm stuck.  i'm trying to just do a certificate.  don't you need one for "incoming" and "outgoing"?
[05:46:30] <MetaNova> define "recognize a fingerprint"
[05:46:53] <predicament> where you log in and /whois yourself and it literally says it in there
[05:47:03] <MetaNova> ah, that. if you're trying to make ZNC authenticate you to libera (or another network that supports it) with SASL EXTERNAL, have the sasl module loaded and follow the [[Cert]] page
[05:47:03] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/Cert
[05:47:13] <predicament> sigh
[05:47:18] <MetaNova> which it seems you may have already, given /var/lib/znc/.znc/users/storm/networks/Libera-Chat/moddata/cert/user.pem exists
[05:47:20] <predicament> i've been over that page 20000 times
[05:47:24] <predicament> yes
[05:47:25] <MetaNova> following this, add the fingerprint to nickserv
[05:47:28] <MetaNova> /msg nickserv cert add
[05:47:32] <MetaNova> do this, what is the output?
[05:47:35] <predicament> doesn't work.
[05:47:45] <predicament> insufficient
[05:47:49] <predicament> that means it didn't connect with one
[05:47:57] <predicament> somehow.
[05:48:09] <MetaNova> I see. how did you generate the cert? also, what are the file permissions/ownership?
[05:48:19] <MetaNova> it needs to be owned by the user:group which is running the ZNC process
[05:48:51] <predicament> permissions are to user znc (arch linux literally tells you to do it a tad differently but in general it should be the same thing just a different directory.)
[05:48:56] <predicament> yeah
[05:49:16] <predicament> it's.. generated by root so i would have to do znc:znc
[05:49:35] <predicament> i can't get to /var/lib/znc/.znc with just sudo
[05:50:19] <predicament> i have to be root to actually even list the directory in ssh
[05:50:21] <predicament> funny.
[05:50:54] <MetaNova> it needs to be owned by the same user as the ZNC process, the output of '/msg *cert info' just checks that the file exists, not if it can actually read it, or if it is even a valid file
[05:50:56] <predicament> also, when i did a wipe, i noticed it didn't create it in the home directory of my user.
[05:51:07] <predicament> the znc process is in the background actually
[05:51:11] <predicament> and given where it's at
[05:51:19] <predicament> /var/lib/znc/.znc
[05:51:36] <predicament> hold on
[05:51:38] <predicament> give me a moment
[05:51:41] <MetaNova> that's the result of installing from a package and ZNC being installed as a service
[05:51:50] <predicament> yes systemd
[05:51:52] <MetaNova> versus $ znc --makeconf
[05:52:49] <predicament> it was sudo -u znc znc --makeconf
[05:52:55] <predicament> that's what i had to do originally
[05:53:05] <predicament> liek you see there it's actually made by the user znc itself
[05:53:10] <MetaNova> where $HOME for 'znc' is /var/lib/znc right
[05:53:24] <predicament> /var/lib/znc/.znc/
[05:53:43] <MetaNova> so, sudo chown znc:znc /var/lib/znc/.znc/users/storm/networks/Libera-Chat/moddata/cert/user.pem
[05:53:53] <MetaNova> then cycle the connection
[05:53:57] <MetaNova> /msg *status connect
[05:54:02] <predicament> alright it's worth a try
[05:54:04] <predicament> hang on.

[15:20:35] <bookworm> so you're now trying client side cert auth?
[15:20:54] <bookworm> as certauth implies computer --> znc, not znc --> libera.chat
[15:22:31] <Casper> For ZNC->IRC you'll want [[cert]] indeed.
[15:22:31] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/cert
[15:23:30] <bookworm> it's essentially [client] --certauth--> [znc] --cert--> [libera.chat] if that helps

[15:24:16] <bookworm> bit ugly naming, granted. but the docs do explain it :)
[15:28:02] <predicament> i have a hard time understanding the docs if i dont have it set up right.
[15:28:21] <predicament> someone was very helpful and reminded me about permissions
[15:28:26] <predicament> so i got further, but not far enough
[15:29:25] <predicament> client certauth through to the znc, so use one on the local one as well. i mean i have them listed as mentioned in the docs.  i generated them and im not messing around with the other stuff.
[15:30:10] <predicament> it's not at the home directory and runs with user znc because i'm running arch linux i guess.  but it still finds a certificate i generated.
[15:30:24] <predicament> i have everything i could possibly done, there's probably something i didn't understand along the way
[15:30:38] <predicament> i'm trying to figure out how to ask this question.
[15:33:33] <predicament> I have cert, certauth, and certfp up regarding what I've been following, or trying to follow.  i have had it up for awhilr actually.  i've really been using the maintainer's version.  It didn't matter before when it worked so there was something I did before that was correct that I am not doing now I guess.  I did a clean install of it.  sudo -u znc znc --makeconf is what arch tells you to do
[15:34:40] <Casper> Currently you're trying client->ZNC or ZNC->IRC?
[15:34:43] <predicament> doesn't go to home directory first, but i apply it to its location.
[15:35:24] <DoctorD90> MetaNova, I read a bit the buffer. I think it would be good add the differences between certificates usage (znc.pem/cert/certauth)

[15:37:58] <predicament> it's not like i haven't been trying, which is what you guys would rather want i'm guessing
[15:37:59] <DoctorD90> it's essentially 'client' -- [[certauth]] --> ZNC -- [[cert]] --> 'libera.chat' if that helps

[15:38:51] <Casper> predicament: /znc *cert info
[15:38:56] <Casper> Does that say you have a cert loaded?
[15:38:56] <predicament> :/
[15:38:59] <predicament> yes.
[15:39:04] <predicament> i loaded it thyself.

[15:39:14] <DoctorD90> And thanks, you doubt will push me to write a little explanation on them :)
[15:39:36] <predicament> <*cert> You have a certificate in /var/lib/znc/.znc/users/predicament/networks/Libera-Chat/moddata/cert/user.pem
[15:39:44] <predicament> it says this for the respective networks i'm on
[15:39:46] <noob> correct me if i'm wrong. certauth is for client > znc, and cert is for znc > irc network
[15:40:00] <predicament> okay that is huge for me actually
[15:40:13] <predicament> i didn't think that's what it was, someone said something else awhile ago that contradicts that
[15:41:00] <DoctorD90> [[Cert]] : This module lets users use their own SSL client certificate to connect to a server (ZNC -> IRC Server)
[15:41:00] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/Cert
[15:41:04] <Casper> predicament, so if it says that you have it loaded, then it should be valid. If you do /whois predicament will that give you a certificate fingerprint?
[15:41:23] <predicament> i do.  have a fingerprint.
[15:41:24] <DoctorD90> [[Certauth]] : This module lets users log in to ZNC using SSL client keys (IRC Client -> ZNC)
[15:41:25] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/Certauth
[15:41:34] <predicament> oh
[15:41:36] <predicament> so really
[15:41:39] <predicament> if it's my own..
[15:41:42] <predicament> and it's one user..
[15:41:52] <DoctorD90> ps. what fingerprint are you using?
[15:41:52] <Casper> predicament, so cert is configured correctly.
[15:42:19] <Casper> So, now what exactly is the issue you're having / trying to do?
[15:42:19] <predicament> i think if you whosi me you'll see it?
[15:42:31] <DoctorD90> each server requires different fingerprint and moreover, in hex format
[15:42:36] <Casper> predicament, no we don't :p
[15:42:45] <Casper> DoctorD90, you can use the same fp for all.
[15:42:50] <predicament> i think i got "certauth" and "cert" mixed up.  originallly i wanted an autologin with hexchat with SASL EXTERNAL etc
[15:43:25] <predicament> at the time it was working i had it set up the way it should've been.  i think anyway lol.  i even have my hexchat certs as it says to do
[15:43:34] <predicament> the Network name.pem as listed
[15:43:43] <DoctorD90> Casper, from my memory (probably the irc services got updated in these years), each of them requires different hash to be used :) (md5, sha1, sha256, sha512)
[15:43:53] <predicament> ^
[15:44:10] <predicament> you guys use 512 so
[15:44:45] <noob> predicament: you trying to set certauth for znc > irc server or client > znc ?
[15:45:00] <DoctorD90> on the [[cert]] page is reported : note: Different IRC networks use different fingerprints, for example Libera.chat uses SHA-512. Consult the network you're connecting to for this information. (Im not sure If I added it or not xD)(so maybe self referencing xD ahahah)
[15:45:01] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/cert
[15:45:08] <Casper> DoctorD90, well, it doesn't really matter what the services do to get you your hash, the cert can be the same. If you simply do /ns cert add without a fp it'll add the current fp, which might be in md5 sha1 or whatever hash :p
[15:45:47] <predicament> it was a quick cert generation, i did RSA 4096.  which is good.  i have my znc.pem there though.  im wondering if it takes precedence.  some people are saying it does, some are saying it doesn't.  but i am not using this as fingerprint.
[15:46:05] <DoctorD90> Casper, really? Nickserv will accept all hash format? nice! good to know! but this is only for libera.chat that update?
[15:46:08] <predicament> the one it generates.
[15:46:11] <predicament> when you install.
[15:46:14] <predicament> that znc.pem.

[15:48:29] <noob> that's what i thought
[15:48:42] <DoctorD90> Casper yes, the fingerprint will change according to the same cert, based on which hash has been used, but I wasnt aware that IRC services were so updated to accept more than 1 hash fingerprint :) 
[15:48:48] <noob> Casper: thanks
[15:48:55] *** Joins: predicament (~lol@thunder.h3ck3d.us)
[15:49:02] <Casper> predicament, the znc.pem it generates is the SSL Cert you get to see when you connect to ZNC with IRC or web, this is not for a connection to any networks for example.
[15:49:15] <DoctorD90> and znc.pem is the "server" (znc) certiificate (time to lunch see you later)
[15:49:40] <Casper> So the znc.pem is only to be used by ZNC, you should not re-use it for either cert or certauth.
[15:49:53] <predicament> okay this is great info
[15:49:55] <predicament> seriously
[15:50:04] <DoctorD90> Casper, give a look at [[Certificatetest]] ad give me a feedback please :) (I think it would be good if I add that oint on cert-certauth...I was doing in the hardening page but...meh...I will do there)

[15:54:18] <predicament> this is a lot of great info
[15:54:20] <predicament> thank you
[15:54:33] <noob> predicament: certauth is for irc client > znc, and cert is for znc > irc network
[15:54:40] <predicament> that's what i thought
[15:54:48] <predicament> i think i do understand taht now
[15:55:00] <predicament> client, to znc.  so now i know what to do.
[15:55:02] <predicament> i think.
[15:55:16] <predicament> i remember now.  such a moron i am.
[15:55:39] <predicament> but this time im trying to do it via networks
[15:56:04] <predicament> not the issue though
[15:56:19] <predicament> i appreciate this a lot.
[15:56:42] <predicament> i haven't seen certificatetest since i did it correctly
[15:57:02] <noob> if you read https://wiki.znc.in/Certauth here. its clearly explain how to use certauth
[15:57:08] <predicament> i have neurological and memory issues (epilepsy
[15:57:27] <noob> "From now on you can log in to ZNC with any password but it cannot be blank. E.g. you can just send an "user@identifier/network:" as the server password."
[15:57:41] <predicament> yeah it doesn't seem to let me do that
[15:57:43] <predicament> so
[15:58:08] <predicament> i have to use my pw when i do the /quote PASS user/network:pass
[15:58:17] <predicament> even when i select "SASL EXT" for hexchat
[15:59:28] <predicament> but i can do plain text PW with just the PASS command anyway
[15:59:33] <predicament> its the same thing isnt it
[16:00:16] <predicament> because it's not using the cert yet.  i am sitting on this for a moment, i'm actually sitting at a hospital.

[16:07:01] <Casper> predicament, DoctorD90, noob; https://i.cspr.cc/b5a0488357.png maybe this clears it up a bit?
[16:11:00] <DoctorD90> back!
[16:14:17] <DoctorD90> Casper, it is nice! It is practically what I try to explain in Hardening xD but Im not fully sure that this would be clear enough....cause You used a "Signed" ssl certificate, and this could lead people thinking that only signed SSL works. More over, for the znc-server you joined SASL and cert when on znc they are different module (Im not an IRC expert, I dont know if SASL is used in the Cert too). Same thing for the client side: there is a SASL 
[16:14:17] <DoctorD90> authentication? 0o (I didnt know xD)
[16:14:33] <noob> Casper: nice! thanks
[16:16:06] <Casper> Yeah, the Signed SSL page was the first that came to mind, but it can be anything. :p And I'll make a few changes because cert and SASL EXTERNAL are different indeed.
[16:17:26] <Casper> https://i.cspr.cc/c97ba67fdc.png 
[16:17:37] <DoctorD90> Casper if you can hold a moment to change it, you may see changes....too late xD 
[16:18:51] <DoctorD90> for the client-znc I would use HTTPS removing the brackets, cause if it is SSL it is indeed S :P
[16:19:08] <DoctorD90> with brackets im ued to see it when SSL can be there or not
[16:19:12] <Casper> Derp, ofcourse, haha.
[16:19:28] <DoctorD90> and double [[ ]] there too 
[16:19:29] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/_
[16:19:56] <DoctorD90> and as before, personally I would remove 'signed'...not aware people could misunderstood
[16:20:48] <DoctorD90> moreover: you are mixing a bit the information: you put IRC/HTTPS upper and below IRC SASL/Cert
[16:21:18] <DoctorD90> in the first line there is the protocol or the 'method'? cause the Cert module could be used also (and I love it) for the https versin
[16:21:18] <Casper> But [[SSL certificate]] isn't a page. :p
[16:21:18] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/SSL_certificate
[16:22:38] <Casper> https://i.cspr.cc/c2a36876d2.png for now, heh.
[16:23:06] <DoctorD90> AAAAA You are pointing litterally to a page! sorry ! I didnt focus on this! well..at this stage, let it point at [[Certificate]] - Once I will end up in fixing the [[CertificateTest]] I will move content to [[Certificate]] (or SSL_Certificate)(even if it is a bit misleading wtht the Signed_SSL_Certificate page for the naming for me)
[16:23:06] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/Certificate https://wiki.znc.in/CertificateTest https://wiki.znc.in/Certificate
[16:23:30] <DoctorD90> im currently improving the 3 types of certificates requested in the page
[16:24:04] <DoctorD90> i was thinking to do it in the Hardening page, but a first clarification on the main page for the SSL could be good
[16:25:34] <Casper> https://i.cspr.cc/7354baea95.png and maybe use SSL_Certificate as page, and then add a sub-section named Signed SSL cert, and migrate the current signed one there.
[16:26:45] *** Joins: LSync (~ls@user/deepspace-link)
[16:27:56] <DoctorD90> Casper, there is already the signed subsection :P I just left it as it is, redirecting to the other page cause it is out of the scope of the page (overview on command as reference for other pages). Signed SSL page is a reference based on the community experiences on how to implement/manage each Public CA, so I would leave as a different page with its own section to not complicate maintenance of it
[16:28:20] <DoctorD90> I would just rename the page as "Public CA" than Signed SSL Certificate
[16:28:44] <DoctorD90> cause I use "Signed SSL" by my own private CA :P and even a self signed is "Signed" 
[16:29:36] <Casper> Yeah, but as you said yourself, using 'Signed' is confusing for people :p
[16:30:58] <DoctorD90> in the image on the server side I would suggest: IRC \n SASL & Cert \n (user.pem) \n [[sasl]] / [[cert]]
[16:30:58] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/sasl https://wiki.znc.in/cert
[16:32:41] <DoctorD90> keeping on the first line the protocol in use (IRC and/or HTTPS) and on second the possibilities and as last the modules (even if not being clear to all people the mediawiki tagging, it could be just an overloading of information - the type have been already declared)
[16:33:43] <DoctorD90> Exactly....using "signed SSL certificate" as page name is a bit trick for me :P for this I would change even the name of the page (but I dont know I to do and I would like to not rewrite the entire mediawiki without permsissions XD ahah)
[16:40:10] <predicament> thats literally what i had setup, that picture.
[16:40:14] <predicament> i dont even

[16:43:36] <predicament> there's no retard's guide.

[16:47:42] <DoctorD90> Casper, thanks for the fix, but I didnt got where to put it xD

[16:51:13] <predicament> hexchat
[16:51:47] <predicament> ;/  nothing is pwless so far.
[16:51:47] <DoctorD90> ok, then, follow the guide 3 times (just do it in 3 different folders) using ECC key generation
[16:51:59] <DoctorD90> the page I gave you now
[16:52:00] <predicament> oh but i do rsa.
[16:52:05] <predicament> is that okay
[16:52:09] <DoctorD90> it is not the problem at all :)
[16:52:10] <predicament> i would think thats fine
[16:52:16] <DoctorD90> rsa is wider accepted
[16:52:29] <DoctorD90> rsa is much more adopted than ecc
[16:52:44] <DoctorD90> ecc is just "better" but it could land in compatibility issues
[16:52:44] <predicament> well so what is wrong with that lol
[16:52:50] <predicament> oh
[16:52:54] <predicament> i heard about it
[16:52:56] <predicament> yeah
[16:52:58] <DoctorD90> hexchat is able to manage ecc
[16:53:06] <DoctorD90> but if you prefer, just go with rsa :)
[16:53:11] <DoctorD90> that's not the problem
[16:53:14] <predicament> which is more secure
[16:53:18] <DoctorD90> follow these:
[16:53:38] <DoctorD90> https://wiki.znc.in/Certificatetest#RSA

[16:54:11] <predicament> thank you btw
[16:54:20] <DoctorD90> follow these 3 steps, for 3 times. Each time in a different place
[16:54:32] <predicament> 3 different places

[16:54:35] <DoctorD90> welcome. You are doing what is in my scope to update the wiki
[16:55:18] <DoctorD90> cause the commands are always the same, other wise you will overwrite previous generate stuff, and by chat could be difficult to understand on which file are you referring to :)
[16:55:24] <predicament> also, you should know, i do have bad memory issues.  i used to be much sharper than this
[16:55:25] <DoctorD90> much easier refering to folders
[16:55:41] <DoctorD90> no problem at all :)
[16:55:46] <DoctorD90> it is a monkey process.
[16:56:00] <DoctorD90> 3 times those 3 commands, each in a seprated folder
[16:56:09] <predicament> oh did you mean jsut rename it
[16:56:12] <DoctorD90> cause you need 3 different certificates in the end

[17:46:18] <jm18> did you export your public and private keys to different files?

[17:46:54] <jm18> are they in the same file or are the in separate files?

[17:48:07] <jm18> but for 1 network do you have the public and private key in the same file?
[17:48:27] <predicament> no.
[17:49:36] <jm18> ok, then `cat publickey privkey > user.pem and store that in the correct folder

[17:52:07] <predicament> for user.pem
[17:52:14] <jm18> if you follow the instructions on https://wiki.znc.in/Cert  it shows you for rsa output the keys to the same file and for ecc generate the keys then cat them into the same file  
[17:52:25] <Casper> For certauth you need to use the cert on your CLIENT.
[17:52:27] <predicament> wait hold on
[17:52:38] <predicament> so the ecc and RSA, you have to do both
[17:52:39] <predicament> ?
[17:52:39] <jm18> folder should be ~/.znc/users/<user>/moddata/cert/
[17:52:46] <predicament> okay, thats wht i thought
[17:52:55] <predicament> close neough
[17:52:59] <Casper> predicament, your cert module cert is fine.
[17:53:07] <Casper> Now certauth is for hexchat, not znc.
[17:53:29] <jm18> he said he is trying to use cert, not certauth
[17:53:37] <predicament> no he's right
[17:53:40] <DoctorD90> hold on jm18 - public and private hasnt to go togehter :)
[17:53:42] <Casper> If he whoisses himself and he has a cert, he has cert working.
[17:53:54] <predicament> it doesn't need to be together according to the wiki?
[17:53:58] <Casper> ~ 15:15:45 × predicament × but certauth says i have no valid pub key <- Because it's certauth, not cert.
[17:54:03] <Casper> certauth = client -> znc.

[17:56:42] <DoctorD90> Casper, I love you xD
[17:56:45] <predicament> im telling you
[17:56:54] <DoctorD90> no predicament you are just tired and worried about your mom state
[17:56:57] <DoctorD90> dont worry at all
[17:57:12] <predicament> ill fix it i can barely think though
[17:57:21] <Casper> predicament: /znc loadmod sasl | znc *sasl mechanism EXTERNAL | znc *sasl set <nickservusername>
[17:57:34] <Casper> That's -all- there should be to it, as you've already properly configured your cert module.
[17:57:47] <predicament> and there s amigraine, and the sun is in my eyes.  yes i did actually,
[17:58:04] <Casper> And add a /znc *sasl verbose true <- to it as well.
[17:58:11] <predicament> I did
[17:58:12] <predicament> :)
[17:58:16] <predicament> i like verbose
[17:58:18] <DoctorD90> my suggestion is just to do not continue on that topic cause it could be a bit tricky if you are tired :) that said, I come back to fix the pages :)
[17:58:19] <predicament> i want to see shit
[17:58:21] <predicament> :P
[17:58:25] <Casper> So all 4 commands you have executed?
[17:58:57] <predicament> no i didn't do anything yet, i'm trying to get a nurse's attention, hang on
[17:59:19] <predicament> and yeah i did do those.
[17:59:28] <predicament> i set the password for it too
[17:59:30] <Casper> Yet it's not working? What does *sasl return?
[17:59:38] <Casper> But the password is only for SASL PLAIN, not EXTERNAL. :p

[18:08:53] <DoctorD90> Casper are you aware if based on the znc source code, is possible to explicit define TLSv1.3 as wanted protocol? (or if it could be improved in next release?
[18:09:30] <DoctorD90> as per configuration page, tlsv1.3 is not an available option
[18:10:15] <Casper> return {"SSLv2", "SSLv3", "TLSv1", "TLSV1.1", "TLSv1.2"};

[18:11:45] <DoctorD90> Casper, from my understanding, theoretically speaking, it would be an if statement adding? ( I didnt check GetAvailableSSLProtocols() )
[18:12:37] <Casper> I don't know if Csocket has that available, so it's not a "simple" adding of an if :P
[18:12:53] <DoctorD90> wow....maybe I can make a pull request xD it seems "easy"
[18:13:00] <DoctorD90> as not said :D
[18:13:22] <DoctorD90> checing in the file, there are just a bunch of list...but I expected something like this
[18:13:44] <DoctorD90> if you dont mind I will open a issue for the 1.3 (it is going to be a security fall)
[18:14:00] <Casper> https://github.com/jimloco/Csocket/blob/master/Csocket.h#L634 also doesn't have it :p 
[18:14:12] <Casper> I'm not sure if it's as simple as adding 32 to that under 1.3.

[18:37:45] <DoctorD90> apologies! xD
[18:38:06] <DarthGandalf> <DoctorD90> which one? :)
[18:38:12] <DarthGandalf> I already closed yours with the link to this one
[18:38:17] <DarthGandalf> Then commented here
[18:38:17] <Casper> With some simple changes support for SSLProtocols +TLSv1.3 in the config is easily added, but I have no clue what other stuff needs to be added.
[18:38:27] <DoctorD90> thank you!! I was going to close it immediatly!
[18:38:39] <Casper> Unfortunately AdiIRC does not support TLSv1.3 so I can't test functionality on IRC, but it works fine on Chrome at least :P

[18:39:05] <DoctorD90> meh...I havent space to run the virtual machine for testes :(
[18:39:08] <DarthGandalf> SSLProtocols +TLSv1.3 is one of items there, yes

[18:40:19] <DarthGandalf> > As said: it just works if openssl is new enough.
[18:40:19] <DoctorD90> ROFLMAO....I did a so precise check last year xD ahahahah I neither remembered xD
[18:40:36] <DoctorD90> yeah xD I totally forgot to have run the test already ahahah
[18:40:56] <DoctorD90> sorry! XD i dont know why but TLS gave me no matches
[18:43:19] <DoctorD90> so practically Im remembering. It is relaying mainly on the openssl version more or less... So the default configuration should be All -SSLv2 -SSLv3 -TLSv1 -TLSv1.1 +TLSv1.2 +TLSv1.3
[18:43:54] <DoctorD90> before I did another mistake, DarthGandalf do you agree that there are no open issues about the tlsv1.1?
[18:46:01] <Casper> DarthGandalf, are SSL_verify_client_post_handshake() and SSL_set_tlsext_host_name() new things added to TLSv1.3 in general?
[18:46:21] <DarthGandalf> Casper: I don't remember, please check
[18:46:44] <DarthGandalf> I saw some guide somewhere how to do tls1.3, it's from there
[18:46:49] <Casper> I mean, they're on the issue page, but the first one is not part of ZNC source at all, so I assume it's something new. :p

[19:06:39] <DarthGandalf> DoctorD90: what do you mean by default from there?
[19:07:32] <DarthGandalf> you can edit wiki, right?
[19:07:41] <DarthGandalf> can you make it clear that these are not the defaults?
[19:08:04] <DoctorD90> in the [[configuration]] there is this: SSLCiphers = EECDH+AESGCM:EDH+AESGCM:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH
[19:08:04] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/configuration
[19:08:26] <DoctorD90> so I expect that in the znc source they are set as default
[19:08:30] <DoctorD90> am I wrong?
[19:08:33] <DarthGandalf> you are
[19:08:37] <DarthGandalf> just above that table
[19:08:45] <DarthGandalf> > All values are examples. 
[19:08:51] <DarthGandalf> make it more nonsense maybe?
[19:09:00] <DarthGandalf> to make it more obvious that this is not default
[19:09:13] <DarthGandalf> +SSLv2 for example
[19:09:15] <DoctorD90> aaaa....sorry! I didnt notice/read all
[19:09:30] <DoctorD90> I expected it was the defaults
[19:09:37] <DoctorD90> coming from a fresh installation
[19:10:06] <DoctorD90> cause the line above said 'The allowed SSL ciphers. Default value is from Mozilla's recomendations'
[19:10:15] <DoctorD90> so I thougth it was the default too
[19:10:45] <DarthGandalf> if you click the link, you'd see that mozilla's recommendation is very different from this example value
[19:12:18] <DoctorD90> eactly my point last nigth xD and I thougth Mozilla had updated them since the first run of the wiki
[19:12:45] <DoctorD90> may i kindly ask you (from source code) which are the reccomend ? The modern version or intermediate?
[19:12:55] <DoctorD90> (recommend by mozilla)
[19:13:07] <DarthGandalf> may you kindly look at the source code?
[19:13:18] <DoctorD90> I dont know C :(

[19:35:28] <DoctorD90> DarthGandalf, i tried to install from scratch the ZNC to get the info but they are not explicited, so im not able to say which are the default sorry :( and moreover, during the initial configuration it ask to use SSL and the default is no. It should be yes
[20:07:32] <DarthGandalf> search for ciphers or for mozilla
[20:08:16] <DarthGandalf> you mean, for listen?
[20:24:21] <DoctorD90> I dont know, cause seems there are no differences for settings client side from the servers side, so I assume the same ciphers are used from listener for clients and to establish the connection with server
[20:25:41] <DarthGandalf> ciphers yes
[20:25:47] <DarthGandalf> but ssl on/off is separate
[20:25:56] <DarthGandalf> you can easily connect to 2 different servers, one with another without
[20:26:14] <DoctorD90> btw I think that [[Certificatetest]] is complete enough....let me know when you have some minutes your feedbacks guys :) I go with the hardening part
[20:26:14] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/Certificatetest
[20:27:02] <DoctorD90> DarthGandalf, but during the configuration, the first setup, the "do you want enable ssl" isnt intended for the client side?
[20:27:14] <DoctorD90> and in that case it should be on y default
[20:27:23] <DarthGandalf> even before you entered the network where to connect to? of course
[20:27:30] <DarthGandalf> and that one cannot be y by default, unfortunately
[20:27:41] <DoctorD90> uh! why?
[20:27:44] <DarthGandalf> because by default all the browsers will show the warning "bad certificate"
[20:27:49] <DarthGandalf> self signed
[20:28:05] <DoctorD90> what about to add it then? :)
[20:28:13] <DarthGandalf> I can't parse your question
[20:31:11] <DoctorD90> the http site are untrusted too, so between an unsecure connection with a warning and a secure connection with a warning i would opt for the secure one. With "add it" I mean, what about to add the disclamir in the installation process? Something like "Do you want to enable ssl [yes]?" and ifit goes on with yes, a line saying "Please be aware that the certificate is a selfsigned one, so all browser ill warn you about security. Please refeer to ...." and 
[20:31:11] <DoctorD90> we can add a point in the page I created
[20:32:11] <DoctorD90> (cause thinking about it, a point about the certificate self signed should be added to the page to inform people.....well...I will do it xD)
[20:35:38] <DarthGandalf> Please send the PR
[20:37:36] <DoctorD90> xD ..... May I kindly ask you where is stored the program? in the znc.cpp?

[21:55:22] <DoctorD90> practically this one: CUtils::PrintStatus(false, "WARNING: All modern web browsers will report the page as insecure and untrusted. It is only due to the Self Signed Certificate. Check https://wiki.znc.in/HardeningTest#Public_CA_Signed_or_Self_Signed_Certificate for more information"); - but I prefer to write it first on wiki and then push it
[21:57:43] <DarthGandalf> There's a signed cert wiki page already
[21:57:56] <DoctorD90> the latest info about the TLS1+ I can find, is in the https://github.com/znc/znc/blob/master/ChangeLog.md#new-6
[21:58:35] <DoctorD90> yeah but it discuss only about the diffences in ow implement file coming from CA
[21:58:55] <DoctorD90> I was thinking a dedicated paragrah for the security point (so under the Hardening side)
[21:59:10] <DoctorD90> otherwise I could move it to the Certicate main page
[21:59:29] <DoctorD90> to let people understand that it is no "unsecure"
