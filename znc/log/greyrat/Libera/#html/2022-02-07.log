[01:22:40] <malmalmal> Hello. I am seeing some WP websites that , when the user does two new lines in a form field, the site renders it as <p>something</p><p>nbsp;</p> , this seems like a bad idea to me, is it? is it valid ?
[01:23:00] <stenno> its valid, but it looks like a bad idea
[01:24:21] <malmalmal> thanks stenno , would you do <br> instead ?
[01:24:35] <stenno> no, i would use CSS
[01:24:39] <stenno> most likely 
[01:25:01] <malmalmal> I see your point, but the context is a user writing something in a field in an admin panel.
[01:25:07] *** Quits: ThePhilgrim (~ThePhilgr@151.41.4.108) (Quit: ThePhilgrim)
[01:25:53] <malmalmal> I am actually going to check what the tool I am using renders when doing two new lines as user in the admin panel fields.
[01:25:55] <stenno> so you are trying to express an 'empty line' ?
[01:26:14] <stenno> i wonder if <br> is fine in that context
[01:26:35] <malmalmal> Hmm, this tool actually does <p></p>
[01:26:37] <malmalmal> empty p tag
[01:27:18] <stenno> <br> sounds more sensible here instead of empty <p>
[01:28:04] <malmalmal> thanks for your oppinion stenno 
[01:31:39] <stenno> i really hate wysiwyg editors for stuff like that heh
[01:32:34] <malmalmal> I am working with Kirby CMS, and it has a nice markdown editor that should be more than enough and very clear on its workings, but users usually frown upon it
[01:33:02] <malmalmal> so it also has a 'writer' editor which is a wysiwyg-like editor, with a sensible approach, but still...
[01:33:29] <malmalmal> I am migrating some texts from a WP wysiwyg to this kirby cms wysiwyg
[01:33:38] <stenno> that sounds like a terrible task
[01:36:06] <malmalmal> the worst
[01:36:32] <malmalmal> it already fried my brain
[01:36:39] <stenno> i can imagine
[01:38:01] <malmalmal> wp->export to csv->csv to array->custom script to clean and transform as needed->assing variables->create pages
[01:38:26] <stenno> what language are you using for the transformation script?
[01:38:29] <malmalmal> I am still not dealing with images.... that is going toi be a pain
[01:38:33] <malmalmal> stenno: php
[01:38:36] <malmalmal> all is php
[01:38:36] <stenno> oh wait is that the php thing
[01:38:38] <stenno> righ
[01:38:53] <stenno> we talked about it in #php
[01:38:57] <malmalmal> yep
[01:39:29] <malmalmal> I am actually going to rest now, can't do much more in this state. Have a good day/afternoon/night
[01:40:08] <stenno> same, good luck with that task

[02:33:24] <SpeakerToMeat> I wonder, does the w3c take in suggestions from the public?
[02:54:44] <lilmonkey> SpeakerToMeat, since we're in #html I'm assuming you mean on the topic of HTML, in which case, it's the WHATWG that handles it, not the W3C.

[03:41:28] <SpeakerToMeat> Oh, interesting. Thanks.
[03:41:56] <SpeakerToMeat> Didn't the w3c used to handle html specs? 
[03:44:50] <lilmonkey> SpeakerToMeat, yes. In short, they went in a direction no one else was interested in (XHTML2), browser vendors got together and formed WHATWG to develop HTML5, W3C was spiteful and stole their work, labeling it as their own, and only a year or two ago did they reconcile when the W3C admitted they're douchebags.
[03:50:35] <SpeakerToMeat> Very interesting. thanks
[03:50:49] <SpeakerToMeat> Now about http, that's under w3c right?
[03:53:02] <lilmonkey> I think it's primarily IETF, but W3C contributes.
[03:53:15] <SpeakerToMeat> Ok, thanks you
[03:53:43] <lilmonkey> (Also, you can propose or contribute to HTML over at https://github.com/whatwg/html)
[03:59:39] <SpeakerToMeat> github. amazing.
