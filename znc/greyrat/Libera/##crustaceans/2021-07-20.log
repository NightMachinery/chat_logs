[01:05:20] <indigo> All the time
[01:06:57] <geoffwozniak> Just had a really weird conversation where the answers to my questions make no sense to me
[01:10:41] <Brekkjern> Man... Why does this GraphQL shit have to be so dumb...
[01:11:16] <indigo> I thought GraphQL was The Futureâ„¢
[01:11:56] <Brekkjern> Well, I like the concept, but I'm trying to jerry-rig file uploads onto this and it's not really working that well :P
[01:12:12] <indigo> File uploads are the worst
[01:12:16] <Brekkjern> Yep
[01:13:34] <Brekkjern> HAH! FUCK YOU! I WIN!
[01:13:51] <Brekkjern> I also don't know how this works as I just copied and pasted it, but fuck it...
[01:19:26] <mouseghost> hmmm?
[01:19:32] <mouseghost> wahs the problem
[01:21:20] <Brekkjern> GraphQL does not support multipart form data for file uploads
[01:21:30] <Brekkjern> Or rather... The official spec doesn't.
[01:21:40] <Brekkjern> You can hack it on, but it's a bit iffy sometimes.
[01:36:38] <indigo> Heh... I just say "fuck multipart forms" and set up a separate endpoint specifically for file uploads
[01:37:28] <Brekkjern> I'd do that too, but I really wanted to try this out

[10:18:58] <Church> Heh
[10:32:36] <jjuran> This "X% of people who (got infected / died) were vaccinated" reporting is irresponsible.  The report should be, "X% of unvaccinated people (got infected / died), while only Y% of vaccinated people did so."
[10:35:10] <jjuran> I'm here to report that Catalina is terrible
[10:36:12] <jjuran> I bought a used Mac and am setting it up
[10:36:18] <bkero> Catalina island is great
[10:36:27] <bkero> but you could have done better if you have to rely on it for an operating system
[10:36:36] <jjuran> The photo is beautiful.
[10:36:45] <bkero> I'm sure it is
[10:36:53] <bkero> But the feling of running non-free software?
[10:36:57] <bkero> feeling*
[10:37:36] <bkero> Well, it's not for everyone.
[10:38:35] <jjuran> I was in Internet Recovery's Disk Utility.  I wanted to just zero the hard drive, but you can't.  You can repartition without erasing, or opt for entry-level secure erase which is a pass of random data and a pass of zeros.  Nothing in between.
[10:39:04] <bkero> dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/rdisk0 bs=32M status=progress # ?
[10:40:00] <jjuran> I started doing the latter, until I realized I was going to block-copy a partition from another machine over half the drive, eliminating the need for zeroing at all.  So now I was doing 4x the work I needed instead of just 2x.
[10:40:05] <jjuran> There's no Cancel.
[10:40:21] <jjuran> s/Cancel/Stop/
[10:40:26] <bkero> No ^\?
[10:40:40] <bkero> or kill -9?
[10:40:44] <jjuran> Command-period did nothing.  Quit did nothing.
[10:40:52] <bkero> or even ctrl+c?
[10:40:55] <jjuran> Restart worked as advertised with no warning. :-P
[10:41:05] <jjuran> Ctrl-C isn't a Mac GUI idiom.
[10:41:25] <bkero> meta + option + escape, force quit would be the equivalent I think
[10:42:21] <jjuran> I tried Command-Option-Esc
[10:42:38] <jjuran> No matter, I'm back in Disk Utility
[10:48:56] <bkero> Ok ##crustaceans. I have a hard problem. I need to be able to write a C program from within a shell, passing it via stdin to gcc, then having gcc pass the output to the ld loader to run normally, all without writing temporary files to the filesystem. How do?
[10:55:49] <jjuran> I'm trying to partition the drive so that one partition is just large enough to fit the one I'll copy over.  That's slightly less than half of what's there, but when I attempt to set it (to ~500 GB) it comes out ~680 MB.
[10:55:58] <jjuran> Not a trivial error, as Richard Dawkins would say.
[10:56:59] <Church> Whyyyyyyyy?
[10:57:59] <jjuran> If I just let it do exact halves (and waste half a GB), it works.
[10:58:05] <bkero> It started as a challenge: assume you are logged into a crashed computer's rescue shell with no writable filesystem and you need to *mount* something. But your mount binary is broken. So you need to write a little C program to call mount(2)
[11:01:25] <Church> Hmmm. Thinking
[11:02:22] <gerikson> ``Show HN: C3 â€“ A C alternative that looks like C''
[11:07:03] <Church> bkero: So you can read from stdin with gcc. Just need the -x flag to specify the lang. So `-xc`
[11:07:14] <jjuran> Right, but what about output?
[11:07:19] <Church> Can use -pipe for less writing to the fs
[11:07:23] <bkero> Church: Correct
[11:07:36] <Church> Figuring out the piping to ld... I know there's a way.
[11:09:20] <jjuran> I was only trying to install Catalina (which is the only option Internet Recovery gives me) so I'd have a fresh OS on the new machine to assist with copying over the older system.  But it can't contact the recovery server, soâ€¦
[11:10:10] <jjuran> No message that that's what it's trying to do (until it fails), no progress bar, no Cancel.
[11:12:24] <Church> bkero: Presumably should be able to just pipe to ld ` | ld -`
[11:12:34] <Church> Or specify /dev/stdin worst comes to worst
[11:12:35] <bkero> Church: Nope
[11:12:41] <Church> Hmm.
[11:13:10] <bkero> The loader can't take stdin. It needs a file handle.
[11:13:19] <bkero> Well, a *seekable* file handle:
[11:13:26] <bkero> $ echo -e "#include <stdio.h>\nvoid main() { printf(\"hello world\"); }"  | gcc -x c --static -lc - -o /dev/stdout | /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
[11:13:33] <bkero> /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2: missing program name
[11:14:22] <Church> Hmm... I feel like there's a trick with fd's to be done maybe...
[11:14:36] <Church> This is assuming no writable space at all ya?
[11:15:03] <Church> Because the easy option would be to just overwrite a small but useless binary/lib somewhere
[11:15:27] <bkero> Right, no writable filesystem
[11:15:44] <bkero> You have a squashfs as your rescue initramfs, which is ro, and /dev/shm is off limits
[11:16:37] <Church> Hmm. No mount so no tmpfs...
[11:16:53] <Church> Do we have as I assume?
[11:17:04] <bkero> Right
[11:29:13] <jjuran> You either have to launch a new process or exploit an existing process.
[11:30:40] <jjuran> Make mount a shell builtin :-)
[11:31:16] <bkero> That's getting close to one of the solutions yeah

[18:56:24] <Brekkjern> John Wick is also both hilariously accurate and inaccurate when it comes to guns. That scene when they shoot suppressed guns at each other while walking in the subway was so dumb.
[18:56:36] <gerikson> it's movie guns
[18:56:52] <Brekkjern> Of course

[18:58:00] <gerikson> it's amazing they could spin out 2 more movies about JW
[18:58:13] <gerikson> tehy're dumb but interanlly consisten
[18:58:16] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[18:58:23] <Brekkjern> I love and hate them at the same time :P
[18:59:09] <Brekkjern> That video I linked is even understating how loud suppressed guns are
[18:59:12] <gerikson> action candy
[19:00:02] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[19:00:52] <gerikson> also at least not horribly culurally regressive
[19:04:39] <geoffwozniak> As far as action movies go, they are top notch
[19:05:54] <Brekkjern> Yep
[19:06:59] <geoffwozniak> The really smart thing the first JW movie did was have this weird world of assassins without making it the main story
[19:26:57] <Church> I do feel it's gotten... weird
[19:27:10] <Church> How many fucking people are involved. Even tangentially?

[19:27:13] <buttsbot> Twitter - tnpcollection - Love these. Formerly classified photos from the East German Ministry of State Security demonstrating techniques for Stasi...
[19:27:40] <geoffwozniak> Church: yes, the world is getting a little too big, but the action sequences are still great
[19:27:53] <geoffwozniak> Not sure if there is two more movies there, though
[19:28:08] <Church> Yep we'll see
[19:28:14] <Church> Still gonna see them
[19:28:30] <Church> They're still fun enough and I've seen every damn movie Keanu has done.

[20:23:54] <gerikson> yeah that's my fav part of good speculative fiction, something's just *there* as part of the world
[20:24:07] <gerikson> then nerds tend to require backstories and origins and shit
[20:37:29] <geoffwozniak> A Quiet Place Part II did this well, too. It continued the stories of the characters and avoided needing much backstory. The "Day 1" stuff is short and it's enough
[20:39:58] <cb> if you explain it it's not interesting
[20:55:48] <gerikson> it used to be a minor art - the speculative short story
[20:56:10] <gerikson> I blame excessive world-building on writer's workshops
[20:56:24] <cb> i love world-building but it's a separate concern
[20:57:27] <gerikson> I mean, don't get me wrong, I *loved* the appendices of the LotR
[20:57:45] <gerikson> but part of their charm was they were separate
[20:58:26] <gerikson> one of the only fantasy multi-volumes I've enjoyed is the Malazan Empire one

[20:58:35] <gerikson> and I started reading Book 2 there
[21:02:49] <gerikson> nope, book 3
[21:02:56] <gerikson> but they're also extremely dense
[21:14:04] <cb> to me a thing that relies on its mystery can have world building but it must never explain the mystery
[21:14:18] <cb> like, you have an unknowable thing, elder god, whatever
[21:14:20] <cb> don't explain that
[21:14:25] <cb> but maybe explain the world around it

[21:33:31] <cb> i love twin peaks
[21:44:08] <indigo> I've been watching High Seas, and rather enjoying it. It's like a cross between Titanic and Murder on the Orient Express
[21:54:12] <riv> people on HN say a lot of stuff that strikes me as wrong
[21:54:16] <riv> "You can't be living like a modern westerner in the rat race and do buddhism on the side"
[21:54:32] <riv> i feel like they just kind of say stuff that they think sounds right
[21:57:46] <riv> and about half the comments are trying to compare it with drugs like LSD which I think is probably really dumb
[22:06:22] <companion_cube> Buddha was just really, really high
[22:07:59] <epilys> that's why there are so many tall buddha statues
[22:11:08] <Geekingfrog> :D
