[05:14:01] <himesama> i donT think it is markov

[05:14:26] <himesama> i think it picks the least common word then picks at random or something like that
[05:14:34] <jrm> If it were a Markov Chain, what are states of the chain?
[05:14:42] <Gabin> If I understand correctly, rudybot just picks a phrase that has some word matches with the message request

[09:42:51] <lechner> Hi, remapped    C-x b   to    counsel-ibuffer    but typing a new name no longer creates a new, empty buffer. How can I do that now, please?
[09:43:09] <dale> create procedure cut_paste as begin with (delete from $previous_buffer where line in $region returning lines) as clipboard insert into current_buffer select lines from clipboard; end;
[09:43:43] <dale> lechner: Type desired name and press C-M-j to accept it.
[09:44:09] <dale> Or, no, that doesn't work.
[09:45:35] <dale> I give it 50% odds that it's a bug that doesn't work.
[09:45:54] <lechner> dale: "wrong type argument: listp, $filename"
[09:46:02] <dale> Yup
[09:47:15] <dale> lechner: I suspect it's a bug so you might want to file an issue.
[09:48:26] <dale> I think counsel-ibuffer-visit-buffer is expecting a list because if you select an existing buffer, it gets passed an alist element (display-string . buffer).  Apparently when you type the name of a non-existent buffer and C-M-j, it sends just a string.

[10:21:35] <lechner> dale: may i credit you in the filing?
[10:21:43] <dale> lechner: I think the answer is either (1) it is not so frequently used as you might think, (2) the function is not frequently used to create new buffers (C-M-j is a little known trick in Ivy), or (3) it is a recently introduced bug.  My money is on 2 or 1.
[10:22:11] <lechner> dale: how do people create new buffers?
[10:22:58] <dale> lechner: My C-x b is bound to ivy-switch-buffer.  Creating new buffers by accepting the verbatim input with C-M-j works just fine there. :)
[10:24:48] <dale> lechner: BTW, if you want to use Ivy/Counsel, remember C-M-j, it is not specific to buffer switching.  Want to open a new file, but Ivy keeps taking the candidate that matches part of the new file's name?  C-M-j to accept the file name exactly as typed.  C-M-j works at almost every Ivy prompt, with the most prominent exception being prompts that require you to select from an existing completion

[17:38:27] <hrehf> windows are easy to understand if you think of emacs as an additional `window' manager that behaves to the X window manager as a `frame', and each `window' shows you one piece of content memory `buffer' of any sort (could be a file).

[20:49:19] <piyo> so lets go for the gold: how would one do delete-trailing-whitespace for multiple files (lets make it easy and say selected in the same dired buffer). I don't know the answer to this without using some elisp or editor macros. if there is M-x dired-on-files-delete-trailing-whitespace that would be ... kitchen-sink.
[20:49:37] <dale> There's some face override thing I think you can [ab]use for buffer-local faces.  IIRC.

[23:25:32] <grym> you know how brian jacques' twitch is food?
[23:25:36] <grym> jordans was clothes
[23:25:47] <bpalmer> Certainly one of the things that I noticed when I read WoT is it did focus on having different cultures across the continent, including spending time on dress
[23:26:03] <grym> and then, later, harems.
[23:26:06] <bpalmer> Somewhat also on food, but that's more common; a lot of authors spend a lot of time distinguishing food from one another.

[23:26:27] <grym> food...harems... hmm. 
[23:27:09] <acdw> i've read one brian jacques's book i think.... redwall?

[23:27:28] <grym> ime redwall does not really permit an adult reading 
[23:27:29] <acdw> i am never mad about long descriptions of food
[23:27:32] <grym> i found it did not age well at all 
[23:27:37] <acdw> i've read it once at age....10? 11?
[23:27:40] <acdw> ah too bad
[23:27:48] <grym> too! many! punctuation! marks!

[23:28:16] <grym> it's like how, unfortunately, rhymed couplets seem kind of twee

[23:29:12] <acdw> i tried

[23:29:20] <acdw> oooh very nice
[23:29:25] <parsnip> this will change my life, presumably
[23:29:27] <grym> parsnip: welcome back!
[23:29:31] <parsnip> oh hai
[23:29:35] <parsnip> thx
[23:29:57] <acdw> yeah a/c is very good
[23:30:13] <grym> acdw: the couplet thing comes up w/r/t some translations of master works and difficulty getting into the groove in english because you have to kind of shake off all your nursery rhyme memories to get it 
[23:30:33] <acdw> oh yeah that makes sense. but if you can do it wel it works so well
[23:30:35] <parsnip> i guess sleeping will improve, and possibly productivity at home

[23:31:21] <acdw> i get that
[23:31:23] <grym> acdw: i was thinking of the masnavi
[23:31:45] <grym> where like, it works *great* in persian, and it's singsong-y/child-fodder in english 
[23:31:52] <grym> (or so i am told! i can't read persian)
[23:31:57] <bpalmer> On the rest of the days, I do next to nothing at home, too, but I do nothing on hot days, too.
[23:32:07] <parsnip> :)
[23:32:28] <parsnip> i will have fewer "excuses"
[23:32:57] <parsnip> judybot: you know what your problem is? you
[23:33:17] <judybot> parsnip: have no instinct for the value of the monetary unit. The whole point of a fiat currency is that it maintains value relative to the value of something else. Without a gold standard, the only way to enforce the value of a currency is to make it worth less (cut interest rates or raise tax rates).

[23:36:45] <acdw> grym: ahhh, yeah you gotta watch those translations. pinsky does a really good job by relying a lot on slant-rhymes and such. i've not read masnavi but i've read poor translations that really don't worok
[23:37:00] <grym> acdw: translations are an endless fascination 
[23:37:04] <acdw> a lot of it is b/c english doesn't rhyme as easily as many langauges, so it can sound much more forced
[23:37:05] <grym> and oh boy do i have opinions :P
