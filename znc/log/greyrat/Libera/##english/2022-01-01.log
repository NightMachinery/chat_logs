[22:56:21] <blkshp> "You can..." did you mean that?
[22:56:23] <GuiToris> if you hadn't said it, I wouldn't have even recognized it, it wasn't underlined by my spellcheck
[22:57:13] <blkshp> Because I wouldn't ever say that someone were less intelligent for reading a childrens book. I read (or rather listened to on Audible) Peter Pan the other day.
[22:57:39] <GuiToris> I meant to say, that THEY could have read more books beside Dr. Seuss, they asked what the last book was, they didn't ask them to name all the books they'd read
[22:58:38] <GuiToris> I'll look Peter Pan up, it rings a bell
[22:59:00] <blkshp> The boy who wouldn't grow up.
[22:59:27] <GuiToris> so it's about me
[22:59:50] <GuiToris> well, wouldn't is different than 'don't want to'
[23:00:18] <blkshp> doesn't want to or didn't want to.
[23:00:59] <GuiToris> ahh, WHY?!? oh English, I'm going to hate you!
[23:01:04] <GuiToris> there isn't even a pronoun!
[23:01:57] <blkshp> I don't want to. "The boy who don't grow up" would be wrong.
[23:02:19] <blkshp> I don't want to. "The boy who don't want to grow up" would be wrong.
[23:02:32] <GuiToris> So it's about me (= I )
[23:03:22] <GuiToris> (don't turn your head, it didn't meant to be a smiley)
[23:03:25] <GuiToris> ahh
[23:03:30] <GuiToris> I'm going to shut up
[23:03:32] <GuiToris> mean
[23:04:03] <GuiToris> the problem with native speakers, that they want to understand me, and never correct me
[23:04:25] <GuiToris> you can't really expect any improvements then
[23:05:04] <blkshp> This is why people think I'm an ass because I correct people.
[23:05:05] <GuiToris> this year isn't starting well, I've already made more mistakes than last year
[23:05:17] <blkshp> :D
[23:05:34] <GuiToris> you used to prefer arsh
[23:05:39] <GuiToris> I bet this isn't the right spelling
[23:05:45] <blkshp> arse
[23:06:15] <GuiToris> arse, yes that's it, either way, it's underlined = not an existing word :D
[23:07:10] <GuiToris> German is so close to English, that you don't even need to know the words to understand it

[23:21:01] <blkshp> Yes!

[23:23:39] <blkshp> I have never heard of the latter.

[23:25:42] <blkshp> I passed my German GCSE exams by saying "Ich sprache keine Deutsch"
[23:26:25] <blkshp> though i may have said "Kleine"
[23:26:49] <GuiToris> I've only heard GCSE in school, since I'm surrounded by Americans, they didn't know what I was talking about
[23:27:06] <blkshp> General Certificate of Secondary Education
[23:27:25] <GuiToris> I also didn't know what it stood for
[23:27:35] <blkshp> Now you do :D
[23:27:47] <GuiToris> I think I settled down with 'graduate'
[23:28:06] <GuiToris> I don't really know what I found to please the American ears
[23:30:08] <blkshp> I don't know what they get
[23:31:22] <GuiToris> you'll probably have a better answer for that, one of my buddies told me 'I'm sore in my leg' (he had a pain in his leg because he exercised a lot)
[23:31:35] <GuiToris> how would it sound normally?
[23:31:49] <blkshp> My Leg's sore.
[23:32:54] <GuiToris> is it specific?
[23:33:01] <GuiToris> because sore can be a sore throat
[23:33:09] <blkshp> any ache of any type

[23:34:28] <GuiToris> hmmm, interesting, all of them are rather generic
[23:34:47] <blkshp> Well you haven't explained the type of pain
[23:34:55] <GuiToris> you can have a pain in your leg, because you dropped a piano on it
[23:35:00] <GuiToris> I have
[23:35:08] <GuiToris> because of too much exercise
[23:35:15] <blkshp> But that doesn't explain the pain.
[23:35:28] <GuiToris> oh, I don't know what cause this type of pain
[23:35:55] <GuiToris> for example if you do a lot of sit ups, and the next day you feel this sensation in your stomach
[23:36:01] <blkshp> Is it an ache, is it a shooting pain, sciatica type pain, stabing pain, wrenching pain, lingering pain. Is it dull, sharp, unresolving, lingering, comes and goes?
[23:36:21] * blkshp used lingering twice!
[23:36:34] <GuiToris> and I didn't even notice!
[23:37:00] <GuiToris> well, it's kind of explains why I wasn't able to find it in the dictionary
