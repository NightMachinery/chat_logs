[15:33:15] <Deknos> Is there a protocol, where, on registration in the double-opt-in-process some procedure is running, that for newsletters or mailinglists a credential is generated, which enables senders to send the email (mailinglist ml<->consumer, newsletter sender->consumer) with some token, so that third parties (like mail providers) could verify that this sender may send to the emailadress an email?
[15:34:16] <Deknos> i mean perhaps some agreed signature scheme and public keys of both parties being there, that mail providers can test, if a is allowed to send mails to b?
[15:34:51] <Deknos> it's not about privacy, but about allowing certain email-newsletter senders after double opt in to be not filtered as potential spam
[15:57:55] <Khepra> Deknos: the recipient can mark the sender as "trusted" or as "not spam" if it gets marked like that. What you ask for is something the recipient would have to define anyway. It makes no sense if the sender can verify itself with no input from recipient.
[15:58:23] <Khepra> otherwise every spammer on the planet and inner solar system could abuse it.
[16:02:39] <Deknos> not the sender, but the mail transport agents in between should be verify if it is legitimate to send emails from A to be, if possible depending on some asymetric keys and the email alone. at least that would be the idea
[16:02:52] <Deknos> but okay, i admit, i think if that would exist, i would have heard about it
[16:04:11] <Deknos> Khepra, if a sender is marked as verified, does that work domain (i.e part after @) or user (i.e. part before @) based? and is this communicated to my imap server for example?
[16:09:08] <Khepra> Deknos: that really depends on the recipient email system and capabilities. My point was only to state that it's recipient's responsibility to do this, nobody elses, otherwise it'd be super easy for spammers to abuse that mechanism.
[16:09:36] <Khepra> in other words, no there is no mechanism that says "It's okay, I'm a doctor, the recipient double-opted-in to mail from me, so it's okay for you to relay and not mark this as spam."
[16:10:19] <Khepra> there ARE mechanisms that permit relays to forward without breaking SPF and DKIM, by using ARC and by verifying SPF/DKIM on their edge, and removing it in forwards, and the entire system belongs to recipient as it has to be trusted.
[16:11:39] <Khepra> this again is not something senders or external parties may influence. the recipient has to designate a server that will be the first relay in receipt, that will verify spf and dkim and that will sign a "I promise I checked this" ARC header that then further relays in that trusted network may verify
[16:13:43] <Deknos> okay, there is none. but if there would be system where doctor and patient agree on something, so they could mark their messages that they should be sendable from A to B, so that 3rd parties could verify that independently (on the message itself). and if you build this with assymetric encryption i would assume it's not easy to be abused, but i have to admit, this just came up as i was working on a problem, it may be possible that i do not have thought this 
[16:13:43] <Deknos> through
[16:17:06] <Khepra> you don't need anything as complicated. if you control the MTA, just whitelist the sender client/from/sender/whatever, so it doesn't get marked by content filter or other measures you have. if you don't, check if your provider has controls for that.
[16:17:28] <Khepra> GMail, for example, divides email into certain categories. things that end as spam may be marked as not spam so there, that's it
[16:19:13] <styx> is there a support chan for Dovecot?
[16:19:45] <Khepra> yes
[16:20:11] <styx> could you tell me the name ;)? and IRC network, please?
[16:20:16] <Khepra> you wouldn't believe the name of it!  #dovecot  !  who woulda thunk .)     also:   /msg alis list <keyword>

[16:21:50] <Khepra> I just don't understand the chans that fled Fre^W The Node That Shall Not Be Named,  to OFTC, instead of staying with the most popular network, which is now Libera.
[16:24:59] <Deknos> another question: is there some standard/protocol which is like.. inbox-to-inbox-encryption? like i can deposit for an emailaccount a key, and incoming mails are decrypted with that key, but if i fetch them from the inbox, they are decrypted? (i am explicitely not talking about end2end-encryption like with pgp/smime)
[16:27:51] <Khepra> Deknos: yes, you can use pgp or anything similar, to encrypt content. the recipient can decrypt it if: a) they have the key, b) their MUA supports content en/de/cryption (most do; see Enigmail). The headers may not be encrypted.

[16:42:55] <Deknos> i know of MUA and e2ee (which is done by enigmail/pgp/smime), but is there like some system, where i can put some key to the imap provider (as an example) and the imap provider can decrypt my incoming mails with this key (if encrypted)
[16:43:02] <Deknos> may be assymmetric or symmetric
[16:43:54] <Khepra> why would you do that? you MUA does it. what's the point of encrypting if your IMAP provider will decrypt it? 
[16:44:57] *** Quits: pj (~pj@ghettoforge/pj) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[16:48:00] <Deknos> there may be plenty of reasons. automated commands over mail, where i trust my MDA, and the content of the mail is extracted automatically. or the users are not able to use e2ee well (like, for example in an enterprise environment), or even, there's some regulation which enforces encryption of email content, but it should be accountable by the organization, but there's no key escrow possibility.

[17:09:09] <furrymcgee> there is email over ssh but not ssh over email
[17:23:26] <Deknos> no, but (and i do not want to do that) email as queuing system =D
[17:24:34] <Khepra> automation commands over email is something I've seen done, that didnt' require encryption. hmac or php signing the command payload was enough
[17:25:08] <Khepra> I suppose there are .... privacy oriented.... systems that permit you to upload a key and then they can transparently en/de/crypt messages in the backend, but to me that's defeating the purpose
[17:25:46] <Khepra> if I wanted to ensure encryption on transport, I'd run an MTA which required transport encryption. That'd exclude a number of (ancient) MTAs that never heard of TLS, but I wouldnt' care, the system would've been for dedicated purposes.
[17:26:08] <Khepra> Alternatively, MUA-based payload/content decryption makes the only sense really

[22:44:52] <jaybe> so without dmarc, one of your domains could have idiots sending mail as blah@example and causing you pain without you even being aware of it.
