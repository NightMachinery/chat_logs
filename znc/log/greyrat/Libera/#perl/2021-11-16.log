[06:02:08] <aquanight> zgu: I think building firefox is about as bad tho
[06:02:42] <zgu> www-client/firefox-94.0.1 merge time: 23 minutes and 41 seconds.
[06:02:47] <zgu> www-client/chromium-95.0.4638.69 merge time: 3 hours, 32 minutes and 15 seconds.
[06:02:48] <aquanight> but the ones that would always be murder were glibc and KDE
[06:02:52] <zgu> no they're not even close
[06:03:19] <aquanight> there was another awful one
[06:03:34] <aquanight> libreoffice I think
[06:03:35] <aquanight> any JDK
[06:03:36] <aquanight> zgu: what's your average merge time on glibc?
[06:03:51] <zgu> about 6 minutes
[06:04:08] <aquanight> KDE was always awful because at one time they did this "concatenate all the source files together for better optimizations" or some shit and it meant trying to leverage your CPU with -j3 was pointless
[06:04:28] <zgu> gcc is around 40. longer than most things because it can't distcc the whole thing
[06:05:37] <xenu> webkitgtk?

[19:24:55] <hethw_> #gimmeothersollution
[19:25:08] <hethw_> Grinnz, any other reasons why not to use wantarray?
[19:25:23] <Grinnz> it is extremely easy to accidentally call functions in list context, like you did
[19:25:46] <Grinnz> this is a problem in subroutine arguments and hash constructors, where doing that will result in "missing" entries and bugs
[19:25:52] <Grinnz> because it's returning an empty list, not a value
[19:26:05] <Grinnz> or in worse cases, more than one value
[19:26:31] <Grinnz> if a function unconditionally returns a scalar value, there will be no surprises in these situations
[19:26:44] <LeoNerd> I really should write that  :scalar  sub attr someday
[19:27:24] <Grinnz> sweval: sub foo { return } my %stuff = (x => 42, y => foo(), z => 'bar'); \%stuff
[19:27:26] <perlbot> Grinnz: Odd number of elements in hash assignment at (IRC) line 1. {y => "z",x => 42,bar => undef}
[19:27:32] <Grinnz> ^ concretely, that is the failure mode
[19:27:50] <hethw_> I see. well, I'm happy readline will never return a hash
[19:27:56] <Grinnz> (the problem is being context sensitive itself, which "return" is, not specifically wantarray)
[19:28:06] <Grinnz> "return a hash" is not a thing that's possible
[19:28:52] <Grinnz> both readline and your function with wantarray will result in this bug if you call it within a list
[19:30:20] <hethw_> ah I see, if I ASSIGN it to a hash
[19:30:27] <hethw_> oh no.
[19:30:34] <Grinnz> or to an array, or pass it to a function
[19:30:41] <Grinnz> hash assignment is just the most obvious place it will break
[19:32:41] <hethw_> well, I'm returning undef when it's '' and want's array
[19:32:52] <hethw_> so I guess I wont have that as a problem
[19:32:52] <Grinnz> no, you're returning an empty list
[19:33:02] <Grinnz> which leads to exactly that problem
[19:33:27] <Altreus> but you're also mimicking the behaviour of readline, which you said was important
[19:33:27] *** Joins: gizmomathboy (~gizmomath@206.127.53.107)

[19:35:42] <Grinnz> yes

[19:36:23] <leitz> Perl Best Practices, a great book
[19:36:29] <hethw_> aren't my $scalar a scalar until it's assigned a reference?
[19:36:37] <Altreus> all refs are scalars so that seems quite closely related to me
[19:36:43] <Grinnz> my $scalar is always a scalar, yes
[19:36:52] <Grinnz> doesn't matter what you assign it
[19:37:06] <Grinnz> but not sure what that has to do with a function's return value and refs
[19:37:31] <Grinnz> my $foo = stuff; no refs involved, but scalar context
[19:37:36] <Altreus> LeoNerd once held the opinion that everything should be scalars, and @ and % should be introduced as conveniences later rather than being the basis
[19:37:40] <Altreus> At least, that was my understanding

[19:37:46] <perlbot> hethw_: No output.
[19:38:05] <Grinnz> right, no refs there
[19:38:19] <hethw_> No output. = undef?

[19:38:33] <perlbot> hethw_: [undef]
[19:38:37] <hethw_> I see
[19:39:13] <Altreus> simcop2387: is this a solvable problem? Can we meaningfully show undef instead of no output, or is there no way to determine?
[19:39:41] <hethw_> Altreus, so can I safely assume I'm properly emulating readline?
[19:40:24] <Altreus> erm well no because readline returns the empty string here
[19:40:37] <Altreus> you can tell, because it did
[19:40:59] <Altreus> you were going to mutate $ret, weren't you?
[19:41:23] <Altreus> oh actually maybe you are
[19:41:35] <hethw_> I'm just doing: return if ($ret eq '') && wantarray;
[19:41:36] <Altreus> If you want to return no values in list context this should be fine
[19:41:52] <Altreus> which seems to be what readline is doing
[19:42:08] <Altreus> but if you don't need to mutate $ret then just don't set it
[19:42:20] <hethw_> mutate?
[19:42:30] <Altreus> change ...
[19:42:33] <Grinnz> do you want to emulate readline's returning empty list in list context, or do you want to return an empty string always?
[19:42:37] <hethw_> I have to decode it
[19:42:44] <Altreus> yeah I vaguely remembered you said that
[19:42:46] <Grinnz> these are two different things
[19:43:10] <hethw_> apparently some things expect it to be '' and some to be undef
[19:43:22] <hethw_> first being scalars
[19:43:23] <Altreus> it will never be undef
[19:43:41] <hethw_> return; will do undef to scalars no?
[19:43:42] <Altreus> you will never get undef from readline in this specific situation
[19:44:04] <Altreus> yes, but the existing things are supposed to be expecting readline's behaviour, not this new function's
[19:44:13] <Altreus> The ones expecting readline to return undef are already wrong
[19:44:18] <Altreus> It only returns undef the second time
[19:44:37] <Grinnz> readline only returns undef in scalar context when it has passed end of line - which won't happen if you're slurping

[23:37:46] <jabberwok> I wrote a comment to the "Pre-RFC: Markdown (images, tables) in POD" thread on the perl5.porters newsgroup but, not officially being Whatever, apparently cannot post it.  Any suggestions on how to participate in the discussion?
[23:38:06] <LeoNerd> Join the list..?

[23:40:14] <mst> jabberwok: the newsgroup is just a mirror of the mailing list
[23:40:25] <mst> jabberwok: you can join the list and post to it fine, there's no 'officially being Whatever' required
[23:41:06] <Grinnz> https://perl.theplanetarium.org/ is actually pretty useful these days, i should quasi-bookmark it

[23:43:08] <jabberwok> Thank you. I thought I had, long ago, but ... (looks at a stack of greenbar printouts) it may have been when I was 72623.1675@compuserve or something equally Long Ago.
