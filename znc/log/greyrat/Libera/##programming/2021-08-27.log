[01:27:14] <RedNifreWTF> Yeah, but it's 1 more than the size of the integer part, isn't it? As in, the integer part is between 0 and 2^52-1, but you can go up to 2^52, because that ends in a zero, which is okay to cut off.

[02:29:14] <InPhase> Izem: Or similar.
[02:29:31] <Izem> I mean traditional backends
[02:30:12] <InPhase> Izem: clang, and other llvm based languages, make use of an intermediate representation:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LLVM#Intermediate_representation
[02:30:13] <bayaz> Title: LLVM - Wikipedia 
[02:30:45] <Izem> well yeah
[02:30:53] <jeaye> GCC also uses an intermediate representation.
[02:30:53] <InPhase> Izem: I think this passes through an assembly stage still though.
[02:30:55] <Izem> but I assume they have an assembler as well?
[02:31:26] <Izem> I imagine not using an ir is uncommon
[02:32:54] <InPhase> man clang says the stages are:  driver, preprocessing, parsing and semantic analysis, code generation and optimization (intermediate code stage), assembler, linker.  But it notes, "Clang also supports the use of an integrated assembler, in which the code generator produces object files directly.  This avoids the overhead of generating the '.s' file and of calling the target assembler."
[02:32:55] <edgar-rft> Izem: In the absolute worst case (e.g. on brand-new hardware where nothing else is available) you have to deal with CPU op-codes and similar oddities, but that's rather seldom today.

[03:16:53] <Izem> is that still int?
[03:17:11] <cis> [itchyjunk]: depends on the language, but probably not
[03:17:25] *** Joins: Tazy (~Tazmainia@197.185.105.13)
[03:17:40] <jeaye> [itchyjunk]: In most C-like langs, that's still going to take at least sizeof(int) in automatic memory.
[03:17:48] <cis> [itchyjunk]: "int" is usually shorthand for a specific integer type, like 32-bit, 64-bit, etc.
[03:17:51] <Izem> also what language? static is a keyword in a bunch of languages
[03:17:51] *** Parts: Tazy (~Tazmainia@197.185.105.13) ()
[03:18:13] <jeaye> Yeah, note that static memory and automatic memory are very different.
[03:18:16] <arahael> [itchyjunk]: Do you get 200000000000000 back out?
[03:18:18] <[itchyjunk]> ohhh
[03:18:22] <cis> [itchyjunk]: so your int will take up 32 bits of memory no matter what number it stores (as long as that number fits in the 32 bit range of possible numbers)
[03:18:26] <[itchyjunk]> I'm asking wrt Java
[03:18:38] <arahael> cis: It'll still take 32-bits even if the number doesn't fit. ;)
[03:18:46] <jeaye> The sizeof an int is always going to be the same in Java, regardless of the value of the int.

[03:22:06] <jeaye> Izem: Depends on the lang. C won't error on it and C++ won't without without using uniform initialization.
[03:22:11] <jeaye> You may get a warning, though.
[03:22:26] <[itchyjunk]> Think i've already annoyed the TA's with questions lol
[03:23:02] <jeaye> int i{20000000000000}; // an error, thanks to C++11's narrowing checks within uniform initialization
[03:23:24] <Izem> if java I suspect that will be an error
[03:23:33] <[itchyjunk]> hmmm
[03:23:49] <[itchyjunk]> i didn't realize 32 bit was so small, number wise
[03:23:55] <jeaye> Java doesn't support that syntax. Not sure what it does on indirect initialization.
[03:24:11] <jeaye> [itchyjunk]: We're talking about signed ints here, so that's only the half of it (literally).
[03:24:36] <karstensrage> java has a BigInteger class to deal with larger integers
[03:24:51] <notABoxer> If the value that you are trying to apply to a variable is larger than an int, try long or float
[03:24:53] <karstensrage> and it has long for 64 bit numbers
[03:25:10] <karstensrage> long a = 0L;
[03:25:48] <notABoxer> However, float i{20000000000000}; will still give you an error in java
[03:25:58] <[itchyjunk]> hmmm
[03:26:01] <karstensrage> there is no syntax like that in java 
[03:26:02] <jeaye> Well float i = ...;
[03:26:08] <[itchyjunk]> signed int meaning there is a + or - in front of it?
[03:26:12] <jeaye> Java doesn't support uniform initialization.
[03:26:15] <cis> [itchyjunk]: right
[03:26:20] <[itchyjunk]> interesting!
[03:26:34] <jeaye> [itchyjunk]: Numbers have an implied + in front of them, though.
[03:26:34] <[itchyjunk]> larger numbers are easier to deal with in math than cs!
[03:26:47] <jeaye> 7 is implied to be positive 7. But -7 is negative. +7 and 7 are the same.
[03:26:50] <[itchyjunk]> oh any number?
[03:26:53] <cis> [itchyjunk]: one bit is reserved to indicate the sign, so you lose half the potential range...
[03:27:01] <[itchyjunk]> say a `double x = 1.0` is actually +1.0 ?
[03:27:24] <karstensrage> doiubles are treated totally differently 
[03:27:32] <jeaye> But still, yes.
[03:27:36] <jeaye> 1.0 is the same as +1.0
[03:28:02] <jeaye> In that both result in the same value.
[03:29:04] <[itchyjunk]> hmm interesting detail about the need to track the + or -
[03:29:12] <[itchyjunk]> but i think i can guess why that's needed

Using browser inspection I can see that when the client makes requests to the webserver, a token (which looks like a uuid) is being passed as part of the parameter query. I think this token is generated client side in js. Is there a way to search all the returned pages during login for things

[08:43:42] <InPhase> a_train[m]: I've moderated many things, so I can tell you exactly why regular mods would do such a thing of their own decision-making.  It's because what you think is some sort of righteous free speech, was probably perceived as whiny disruption derailing a conversation that might reach a higher caliber of discourse if they clean it up.

[08:44:03] <a_train[m]> arahael: it's not a question about "so what?" or "and?" or "what does that mean?". It's a question about how and what instructions those admins are given, by who exactly and who those admins are.

[08:44:28] <karstensrage> and every moderator falls in line with those instructions?

[09:06:24] <webNET4> "open source" is a marketting scam term
[09:06:28] <arahael> node1: Ah.  A lot of organisations want people who can pay, and will use the work for financial gain, to actually pay for a license, whilst others who won't pay, should use the license for non-profit reasons.
[09:06:46] <oldlaptop> one has to keep in mind, reading fsf stuff, that there are what you might call intramural disagreements in "open source" on which the fsf very much takes a side. (one of the positions the fsf's side takes is, indeed, that the term "open source" itself is bad)

[09:11:15] <webNET4> scam.

[09:12:15] <InPhase> node1: Yes, those are all variants of open source licenses.
[09:12:29] <oldlaptop> None of this necessarily has much to do with whatever whoever said "open source :) no commercial license." was trying to communicate.
[09:12:37] <InPhase> node1: But they are not all permissive.
[09:14:32] <arahael> node1: Consider that one license may have: "You can use this for any reason, as long as you don't use this in a nuclear reactor, and please attribute us!", and another license may scream "Those are restrictions, and you can't impose any restrictions at all!".  Etecetera.

[12:59:23] <mrig> perfectly natural phenomenon though.
[12:59:44] <mobidrop> mrig, you mean the pendulum will eventually swing the other way as a result of gravity and laws of physics?
[12:59:59] <Akronymus> I certainly think that the msm is a BIG part of how it got so bad.
[13:00:04] <mobidrop> maybe the pendulum breaks under the stress :)
[13:00:06] <mrig> chaotic systems do not move like a pendulum.
[13:00:14] <mrig> they just snap back into order.
[13:00:18] <Akronymus> Double pendulum then?
[13:00:24] <mrig> see above
[13:00:36] <mobidrop> Akronymus, yes true most institutions and media have been taken over in a way
[13:00:44] <Akronymus> Double pendulum is a chaotic system...
[13:02:11] <mrig> sure yes, well it shows the onset of chaos but not its returning to order; But not cyclic patterns, I could be wrong though.
[13:02:16] <mobidrop> mrig, do you think the sleep walkers need help or it'll happen naturally?
[13:02:27] <mrig> mobidrop: oh naturally.
[13:03:20] <mrig> some call it mental illness, but that is a very narrow minded view of the neuro epigenome.
[13:03:32] <mrig> hell of a force of nature.

[13:20:46] <mrig> [itchyjunk]: it is not a static system, it is dynamic.
[13:21:00] <[itchyjunk]> idk what that means
[13:21:50] <mrig> you can see the functioning of a system that you reside within, does not mean that it and you are not being oriented by algorithm's that are not easily perceptible. 
[13:21:57] <[itchyjunk]> mobidrop, flat world view produces a lot of good results when localized 
[13:21:59] <mrig> sorry, you can't
[13:22:08] <[itchyjunk]> mrig, "system" is context dependent
[13:22:17] <mrig> [itchyjunk]: sure it is yes.
[13:22:18] <[itchyjunk]> it can mean anything
[13:22:32] <mrig> [itchyjunk]: I can describe it with context free language though.
[13:22:48] <mrig> Then that anything is defined.
[13:22:51] <[itchyjunk]> so for some hypothetical container system, it might all be static.
[13:23:05] <mobidrop> [itchyjunk], exactly, a flat world is a approximation that worked well in old times (even for normal people today when going about their daily activities it is sufficient)
[13:23:22] <[itchyjunk]> mobidrop, yup
[13:23:28] <mrig> very useful for orienteering :)
[13:24:00] <mobidrop> [itchyjunk], but for example if you were part of the inquisition and believed that nonbelievers should be tortured and killed for their own benefit you're producing a lot of suffering
[13:24:23] <mobidrop> [itchyjunk], so some false world views are benign, while others are actively harmful
[13:24:54] <mrig> Some generate predictive models.
[13:25:13] <mrig> I go with the ones that give results, that is my criterion.
[13:25:24] <[itchyjunk]> mobidrop, that would then depend on what you mean by suffering etc
[13:25:30] <[itchyjunk]> but sure, some views can be distructive
[13:25:44] <mrig> If your model of reality does not coincide with reality, then it is not likely to be very fruitful.
[13:25:54] <mrig> and will not persist.
[13:26:05] <mobidrop> [itchyjunk], I think for most being tortured against their will would be suffering :)
[13:26:12] <mrig> no intervention required, Darwinian motion does its thing.
[13:26:53] <mrig> in fact I would say that this is the underlying cause of the greyness in the world today, ill fitting models of reality.

[13:51:14] <PlanckWalk> Firefox is sitting on 689MB right now here (with 6 windows, 20 tabs)
[13:51:14] <password> who said stripped down?
[13:51:16] <DnzAtWrk> lxqt + debian uses about 250 MB of ram
[13:51:21] <DnzAtWrk> and that's not stripped down

[13:51:37] <password> whats teh point

[16:07:27] <arahael> mrig: Consider that you can specify a fill colour...  And an opacity, but if you don't specify those on the same item, then it's ambigous how those attributes get applied.

[18:08:26] <ishan> I deploy some code to cloudflare workers and the KV stores are accessible via a global variable that is mapped in the worker settings. I create new kv stores, upload data to them and now I want to update the workers code programmatically. For this, I have a JSON file that maps <path> -> <kv store global variable>.

[18:08:42] <arahael> pyzozord: And once you know, you can check for it.
[18:08:48] <ishan> Is there some way to generate a JSON with a global variable like this? I can try something hacky that just writes a string to the json but I'd prefer something a bit better than that 
[18:08:59] <pyzozord> arahael: yeah good question. I basically want to redirect all control characters to do something different
[18:09:04] <PlanckWalk> There are Unicode categories for characters, some libraries let you query them

[18:28:40] <wirehead> to see if it's like the camera's firmware, and if it can be altered
[18:29:00] <wirehead> my goal here is to internally sign each photo with a key that can't be accessed outside the camera chip
[18:29:58] <Amadiro> there's a good chance the firmware would not be modifiable anymore because it's on ROM/fuses were burnt

[18:30:20] <wirehead> well I imagine some raw form of the device can be purchased

[18:30:29] <wirehead> just want to poke around to see what is going on
[18:30:44] <Amadiro> probs best to have a look first what kind of chips are on the board then and how they are connected
[18:30:55] <wirehead> ok, thanks
[18:31:18] <wirehead> so the digital signal processor is definitely some kind of programmed in logic
[18:31:23] <wirehead> nothing particularly analog going on
[18:31:42] <Amadiro> so typically it wouldn't be reprogrammable via i2c either, I think that's pretty rare
[18:31:46] <teut> pyzozord how are you doing that stuff?  I was asking the same thing above
[18:31:57] <Amadiro> I've seen chips be programmable through jtag, rs232, hv etc, but not i2c
[18:32:23] <Amadiro> so to interact with the programming of the chip you might have to connect a jtag debugger instead

[18:45:42] <sandman13> Pain point was, if you had to pass it to some function or C's string library, you had to malloc (realloc).

[18:46:38] <sandman13> Eventually used Gstrings from glib-2.0 :D

[23:54:43] <pyzozord> Yeah I can see memory usage growing significantly with each render of my terminal. Will need to take care of that. Any suggestions how to detect leaks? I heard of valgrind, but it seemed like a big and complex tool that requires a lot of upfront cost in learning

[23:55:03] <Izem> valgrind is hard to beat
[23:55:04] <vdamewood> Okay, i need to charge my phone before i can go get drugs.
[23:56:24] <mrig> elf_fortrez: one of the more interesting things about grammar's I find, is that it is possible to make very lifelike creations with them: http://alvyray.com/Papers/CG/PlantsFractalsandFormalLanguages.pdf

[23:56:48] <mrig> I just go full geek at that sort of thing.
[23:57:05] <pyzozord> I'll check out gcc's -fsanitize=leak. Wonder if that is good enough for simple cases
[23:58:00] <no_gravity> karstensrage: I also want to match "hello world" in "ahello world z".
