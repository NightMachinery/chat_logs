[04:25:46] <jamesecombs> Do you mean that old protocol they used to use to deliver urgent messages? It was only used a handful of times or something
[04:25:56] <jamesecombs> Wasnt that for alerts for vulnerabilities?
[04:26:21] <capuchino> the last time was used to force (recommend) to immediately start using segwit
[04:26:41] <jamesecombs> and you link this to blockstream?
[04:26:49] <capuchino> 100%
[04:27:23] <jamesecombs> Why? Blockstream only benefits from small block sizes. They sell sidechain products
[04:27:55] <capuchino> you're correct
[04:28:21] <capuchino> they forced and made Bitcoin blocksize increase impossible, so they can sell "sidechains" and make money on them

[08:14:04] <jamesecombs> lool
[08:14:25] <capuchino> I love Binance
[08:14:31] <jamesecombs> ???
[08:14:36] <jamesecombs> and not blockstream??
[08:14:56] <capuchino> Binance not poisoned Bitcoin
[08:15:02] <jamesecombs> binance is like posterboy for garbage centralized exchanges
[08:15:09] <capuchino> LOL
[08:15:20] <jamesecombs> LOL
[08:15:35] <capuchino> you just hating Binance because it is Chinese
[08:16:02] <jamesecombs> binance could be from zimbabwe and i would still have the same feelings
[08:17:20] <capuchino> how you can compare Blockstream scam and the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world which turning in a day over 100 BILLION dollars
[08:17:56] <jamesecombs> there is strong evidence they are ghost trading. but i see what you are getting at
[08:18:21] <while> does anyone on here want to start some kind of crypto exchange?
[08:18:36] <capuchino> Blockstream is solely created to disrupt Bitcoin development and make sure they are in control
[08:18:39] <jamesecombs> while: howdy
[08:18:45] <jamesecombs> what did you have in mind
[08:19:16] <capuchino> while, I don't want
[08:19:32] <while> I'm thinking a crowd of us just create some m-of-n keys, and trade OTC monero<->bitcoin, or other crypto of your choice
[08:20:26] <capuchino> all decentralized exchange has failed
[08:20:30] <capuchino> total failure
[08:20:44] <jamesecombs> So OTC XMR to BTC using multisigs?
[08:20:50] <while> thats the idea
[08:21:07] <jamesecombs> I kinda like just the pair
[08:21:12] <jamesecombs> what others did you want to include
[08:21:48] <while> any interested parties really, the principle of the thing is when there is a somewhat large group of people, a good web-of-trust is formed
[08:21:51] <capuchino> NMC<-->BTC BTC<-->NMC
[08:22:33] <capuchino>  web-of-trust
[08:22:37] <capuchino> LOL
[08:22:45] <capuchino> Web-of-Trust?
[08:22:53] <while> capuchino: for those of us who don't follow, could you expand on that?
[08:23:02] <while> like what are you saying?
[08:23:04] <Guest12> why have decentralized exchanges failed?
[08:23:21] <jamesecombs> for a number of reasons
[08:23:29] <jamesecombs> failed is a strong word though
[08:23:38] <capuchino> it is but is correct
[08:23:39] <Guest12> can you tell us the reasons I am curious
[08:23:55] <while> listen, we're just a small group of people making small distributed OTC trades, if $5 goes missing, I'm fine footing the bill for that
[08:23:56] <capuchino> there are many reasons
[08:24:06] <capuchino> hard to use, no users, only scammer etc
[08:24:22] <capuchino> like Bisq
[08:24:32] <capuchino> sucks
[08:24:36] <jamesecombs> low liquidity i imagine the biggest of them
[08:24:43] <Guest12> what is wrong with bisq?
[08:24:47] <capuchino> you have to install a big fcking program and nobody is there
[08:25:01] <jamesecombs> I love bisq personally
[08:25:16] <Guest12> how are people scammers on a decentralized exchange?
[08:25:45] <capuchino> out of time to explain
[08:25:51] <capuchino> think about it
[08:25:52] <jamesecombs> Scammers and dex's are different. If the Dex is a scam then...
[08:26:06] <specing> P2P exchanges are problematic because
[08:26:18] <specing> 1) bank and CC transfers are reversible
[08:26:35] <specing> 2) there's no concrete proof for the DEX to know that a transfer has been made

[08:28:44] <capuchino> is not Bitcoin
[08:28:46] <jamesecombs> no its not a sidechain

[08:28:52] <jamesecombs> different thinkgs
[08:28:54] <jamesecombs> things
[08:29:03] <jamesecombs> LN is a layer two protocol
[08:29:12] <jamesecombs> sidechains are their own indep. blockchain
[08:29:35] <while> haha, we really only need 1 figure of presumed mutual trust to create out p2p multisig exchange, if that

[17:13:07] <Hassan01> isn't the whole point of bitcoin that you need the network to do anything?
[17:13:12] <buZz> nope
[17:13:13] <dodo> or somebody could snail mail you signatures
[17:13:32] <Hassan01> if the transaction isn't in the ledger then how can you say you received it?
[17:13:34] <dodo> though verifying becomes hard then..
[17:13:39] <buZz> why wouldnt it be in the ledger
[17:13:57] <buZz> if a transaction didnt happen , you didnt receive bitcoin
[17:14:05] <Hassan01> you mean you as the receiver don't need to be online
[17:14:07] <buZz> the free bitcoin relays send the ledger for free to the whole world
[17:14:13] <buZz> Hassan01: yes, thats what i said
[17:14:13] <dodo> Hassan01: right
[17:14:53] <buZz> -without- any network connectivity , you can still -receive- bitcoin transactions in that way
[17:16:36] <Hassan01> I wonder how people do in person transactions, I remember in 2012 or so there were sites where you could meet up and exchange bitcoin
[17:17:35] <Hassan01> it gives me anxiety just picturing it lol. you show up with thousands in cash to a meeting with an unknown person then wait around 30 minutes to make sure the transaction went through? sounds ripe for crime
[17:18:07] <buZz> similar to any other OTC transaction really :P
[17:18:34] <Hassan01> those don't really happen without govt backed security though
[17:18:40] <Hassan01> unless it's a criminal deal
[17:18:40] <specing> yes, also the source of that cash/coins could be crime, so you could have problems down the line even if the transaction goes through
[17:18:50] <buZz> Hassan01: you might be suprised :P

[17:25:06] <buZz> sure, if you dont know how to look at the ledger
[17:25:58] <Hassan01> how can you tell if the coins are mine or are stolen? isn't an exchange basically a tumbler which adheres to KYC laws?
[17:26:08] <buZz> no, not really
[17:26:18] <buZz> maybe spend some time looking at the ledger?
[17:26:49] <buZz> it sounds like you havent really been looking at bitcoin technically?
[17:26:58] <Hassan01> I'm just starting to
[17:27:02] <buZz> alright :)
[17:27:43] <buZz> well, exchanges often have all their coins in two wallets, a 'hot wallet' where they do most transactions to/from , and a 'cold wallet' somewhere to remove money from risk
[17:27:52] <buZz> they are often easy to identify on the blockchain
[17:28:37] <Hassan01> ok, that's what I imagined would happen, so when I withdraw from an exchange the only link to my coins would be to the exchange hot wallet
[17:29:01] <Hassan01> so how would you know it was mine?
[17:29:19] <Hassan01> do the exchanges add a comment with my name in the transaction or what?
[17:29:39] <buZz> there's no notes attached
[17:30:06] <buZz> but , say you only sleep between 0:00 and 10:00
[17:30:12] <buZz> and i know you bought 5000 usd of btc
[17:30:26] <buZz> i can see which ~5000 usd sum moved between 10:00 and 0:00
[17:30:33] <buZz> and never during your sleep
[17:30:34] <buZz> etc
[17:30:43] <buZz> human behaviour isnt really spoofable
[17:32:50] <Hassan01> idk, don't really want to get into a personal security discusson as that wasn't really my concern
[17:33:08] <Hassan01> the way I see it the value of bitcoin is that it isn't controlled by any govt
[17:33:31] <Hassan01> and that you can send huge sums easily compared to normal banking
[17:34:06] <Hassan01> but the latter is more valuable to super rich people of which there are few

[18:01:28] <buZz> many stores still accept it , but most ATMs are gone there now , just 2 remain iirc
[18:01:39] <Hassan01> recently some small corner shops wouldn't take a credit card for transactions cheaper than 3$
[18:01:48] <buZz> and back then ATMs barely charged 1% on top , now its almost 15% on many

[18:03:48] <NetSysFire> its probably better to just archive the bitcoin page on the archwiki as its outdated and proteced
[18:04:00] <NetSysFire> so only folks like me can edit it and i have no idea about bitcoin
[18:04:06] <buZz> i dont know, why does the archlinux wiki even need a bitcoin page

[18:04:36] <NetSysFire> but unfortunately there isnt much of that in there. its just bitcoin wiki copypasta from a few years ago
[18:04:44] <buZz> archlinux should focus on getting to >1 architecture already
[18:04:48] <NetSysFire> lol
[18:05:00] <buZz> now that ARM is becoming more and more common
[18:05:03] <NetSysFire> and we got spam too and then the page got protected

[18:05:11] <NetSysFire> yup
[18:05:14] <dodo> lol
[18:05:18] <NetSysFire> there is archlinux arm but thats a different distro
[18:05:19] <buZz> dodo: yes, its hilarious
[18:05:27] <buZz> there is 'archlinux arm' but its just got 1 maintainer
[18:05:34] <buZz> and he gets angry when you report bugs
[18:05:35] <buZz> :D
[18:05:57] <NetSysFire> the archlinux bugtracker is just as bad

[19:34:38] <jamesecombs> like something honestly seems off. He runs a shitty btc forum with about 8 total posts. He just seems SO invested in something for him to just be a troll
[19:34:45] <jamesecombs> mental illness can be a hell of a thing
