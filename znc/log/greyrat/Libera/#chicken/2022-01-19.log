[07:02:36] <DeeEff_> I reckon most haven't gotten very far with HTT yet. From the (very) little I know, it's still a very open and young academic area of research
[07:03:23] <DeeEff_> Dependent types could be possibly classified the same way, but Idris and Coq have been around for at a decade, so they have a bit more history perhaps...

[15:55:18] <sjamaan> Sure: ((foreign-lambda* void () "printf(\"hello, world!\");"))
[15:55:29] <sjamaan> That's a lambda that I immediately call

[22:48:37] <Zipheir> Are there serious technical/policy problems with basing the r7rs egg on utf8, or is it just a matter of finding people to do the work?
[22:50:36] <Zipheir> I suppose similar questions go for Unicode in the CHICKEN core.
[23:00:22] <vandusen> [eggs repo (r41024, by Zipheir)] utf8 doesn't currently export string->vector.

[23:57:18] <wasamasa> in a language like python, this is easy enough
[23:57:38] <wasamasa> you get the same basic APIs for regular strings and byte objects
[23:59:17] <Zipheir> Would this mean incorporating the srfi-207 egg, then?
[23:59:28] <wasamasa> yeah, I just thought a SRFI could be a solution
[23:59:33] <Zipheir> https://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/5/srfi-207
[23:59:46] <wasamasa> for example I like how trivial it is to have both regular string and byte object literals
[23:59:56] <wasamasa> and srfi-207 does indeed provide those literals
