[08:51:19] <pcspkr> would you consider computer cert + username/password mfa
[08:51:30] <pcspkr> technically it is
[08:51:43] <vonunov> I mean
[08:53:37] <vonunov> ok so like if you use it to sign some variable material and then use that to authenticate, sure, then it's like having an RSA key fob or whatever, in a way
[08:53:50] <pcspkr> vpn auth
[08:54:28] <vonunov> but if you're just presenting a cert and that's your second factor then it seems more like a smart card that stays inserted
[08:55:26] <pcspkr> well I'm sure it always does a key exchange with the cert
[08:55:31] <pcspkr> otherwise it would be retarded
[08:55:41] <vonunov> Client cert auth with password required on the client side ?
[08:55:53] <vonunov> lol yeah, I thought you were talking in the abstract
[08:59:29] <pcspkr> it's too bad browsers won't/can't use computer certs for client authentication
[08:59:45] *** Parts: lannonh (spiderman@user/lannonh) (WeeChat 3.2)
[08:59:48] <pcspkr> it would be slick to expose https servers on the internet but just to company devices
[08:59:55] <vonunov> Wasn't there config in IE for that?
[08:59:57] <pcspkr> tls client auth is pretty foolproof
[08:59:59] <vonunov> never used it lol
[09:00:44] <vonunov> well I'll say this much
[09:01:22] <vonunov> I don't see anyone recommending to set up sshd cert auth AND pam_oath
[09:01:57] <pcspkr> I could on a really critical server
[09:02:15] <vonunov> I imagine
[09:02:19] <pcspkr> but public key from smart card is good enough
[09:04:44] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> Technically that is MFA, as in factors of something you know (password) and something you have (private key)
[09:04:52] <pcspkr> yeah
[09:05:52] <pcspkr> also with a computer certificate it technically identifies the device and the private key cannot be accessed by standard users
[09:06:20] <pcspkr> I don't understand the user-centricness of vpn authentication anyway
[09:06:33] <pcspkr> users don't speak tcp/ip, devices do

[09:08:21] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> I cook drugs in his garage

[09:08:59] <vonunov> and if you're VPNing in from your laptop and not on the domain
[09:09:06] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> Yeah for like role based policy. Makes sense
[09:09:28] <pcspkr> you could assign roles to devices
[09:09:37] <vonunov> but yeah also definitely for logging ofc
[09:09:43] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> But that’s not always adequate
[09:10:00] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> You want the device to meet some standard for access as well as the user
[09:10:24] <pcspkr> in some scenarios device = user, practically
[09:10:36] <pcspkr> like when everyone has a personal laptop
[09:10:41] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> Sometimes even shit like NPS or similar to effectively say the device is in compliance, and the user should access x
[09:11:26] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> I see what you’re saying but it’s definitely situational.
[09:11:42] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> And adding both factors adds depth to the security policy
[09:12:53] <pcspkr> and precisely because you should move away from network centric access control, the vpn should just authenticate the device and access control to services is actually via user identity (ideally both, but eh)
[09:13:12] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> Right yeah both is ideal
[09:13:28] <pcspkr> inb4 zero trust
[09:13:57] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> Yeah zero trust is better but I’ve seen like 0 orgs that actually are able to go full 0 trust
[09:16:26] <JollyRgrs> didn't the gubment do it?
[09:16:37] <JollyRgrs> err nvm, they just went passwordless
[09:17:34] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> The other tricky thing with zero trust is weighing Linda the implementation difficulties of exposing more services and implementing proper MFA or like federated auth that is solid, vs possibly pulling most if not all services behind a single point that is your VPN
[09:18:11] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> And only needing to properly MFA and auth via that
[09:18:35] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> And like the threat modeling based on the org, industry, etc

[21:33:40] <Cl0udNinja> I had to drive some 2017 jeep cherokee for like a week. I hated the fuck out of that thing
[21:34:10] <SpookyGibby> I don't like jeeps. Every one I've rode in or driven I've genuinely disliked on nearly every level
[21:34:24] <spiderman> jeep owners have 12 inch lift kits, roll bar, front+rear winch, cold air intake, and no door but only use it to drive to walmart once a week

[23:08:38] <JollyRgrs> from LTT?

[23:41:23] <sd> 09<H​aise> well this is dissapointing
[23:41:27] <sd> 09<H​aise> no WSLg on Win 10 :c
[23:41:47] <CptLuxx> i cant think of a single linux application where i need a gui on windows
[23:41:48] <CptLuxx> lol
[23:42:25] <Activ8> ditto
[23:42:45] <Activ8> linux would say in command line for me, but that's just me
[23:42:51] <sd> 09<H​aise> CptLuxx: I run KVM stack at home so I'll start with virt-manager ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[23:43:17] <Activ8> you can deploy things on windows now anyway with likes of git bash, nodejs, and yarn e.t.c
[23:43:30] <Activ8> but a gui, nah
[23:43:42] <sd> 09<H​aise> also I've seen people
[23:43:46] <sd> 09<H​aise> run VS Code with WSLg
[23:43:52] <CptLuxx> why
[23:44:04] <sd> 09<H​aise> dunno, I know that people do it
[23:44:39] <sd> 09<H​aise> some run Jetbrains IDEs for stuff like Go, PHP, etc
[23:46:47] <Activ8> nuts
[23:48:53] <sd> 03<H​urdyGurdyBurdy> you can load the WSL vm into vscode and jetbrains ide's
[23:49:54] <sd> 03<H​urdyGurdyBurdy> because a lot of people _like_ using windows as a desktop os but the dev experience is subpar, even today.
[23:50:34] <spiderman> I wouldn't even know how to do my work from a windows box
[23:51:13] <Activ8> the dev world is so split now than ever before
[23:51:28] <Activ8> there's that many utilities out there for developing it's splitting up the markets completely
[23:51:41] <Activ8> dev work has boomed IMO
[23:52:47] <sd> 03<H​urdyGurdyBurdy> the biggest issue I see is that windows has never had a true "shell" so a lot of the really nice utilities that install shims and such could never work

[23:54:53] <spiderman> it would probably take me a full day to figure out how to install python and an IDE and set up the ide for python work
