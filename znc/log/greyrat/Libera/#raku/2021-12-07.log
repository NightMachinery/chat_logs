[00:15:05] <melezhik> tonyo I mean "The reason for sleep might be not to over stretch sparky web app, not to generate too many request ", from other hand it's a waste of CPU, right?

[05:20:08] <SmokeMachine> Hi [Coke] ! if curious, I was asking about this:
[05:20:12] <SmokeMachine> m: use Test; class A { has @.b }; my @b = 1,2,3; my %a = :@b; is-deeply A.new(|%a), A.new(:@b) # <---------- Is this expected? Why is the array going inside the other array?

[05:24:51] <gfldex> m: use Test; class A { has @.b }; my @b = 1,2,3; my %a = :@b; is-deeply A.new(|(%a.pairs.head)), A.new(:@b)
[05:24:52] <camelia> rakudo-moar d7152ea59: OUTPUT: «not ok 1 - ␤# Failed test at <tmp> line 1␤# expected: A.new(b => [1, 2, 3])␤#      got: A.new(b => [[1, 2, 3],])␤»
[05:25:34] <gfldex> m: use Test; class A { has @.b }; my @b = 1,2,3; my %a = :@b; is-deeply A.new(|Pair.new('b', @b)), A.new(:@b)
[05:25:34] <camelia> rakudo-moar d7152ea59: OUTPUT: «ok 1 - ␤»
[05:26:01] <gfldex> My guess is that Rakudo does rely on .pairs .
[05:26:19] <gfldex> m: use Test; class A { has @.b }; my @b = 1,2,3; my %a = :@b; dd %a.pairs;
[05:26:19] <camelia> rakudo-moar d7152ea59: OUTPUT: «(:b($[1, 2, 3]),).Seq␤»
[05:28:43] <SmokeMachine> but .new(:@b) isn't a pair but an "named param", right?
[05:29:30] <SmokeMachine> m: class A { has @.b }; say A.new: :b[1,2,3]; A.new: "b" => [1,2,3]

[05:42:30] <gfldex> colon-pairs and Pairs are supposed to be equivalent. The only difference is that you can use colon-pairs as adverbs in operators - what is a grammar level thing.
[05:47:52] <SmokeMachine> it doesn't seem to be related to the array being itemised
[05:47:54] <SmokeMachine> m: use Test; class A { has @.b }; my @b = 1,2,3; my %a = :@b; is-deeply A.new(:b[$@b]), A.new(:@b)
[05:47:54] <camelia> rakudo-moar d7152ea59: OUTPUT: «not ok 1 - ␤# Failed test at <tmp> line 1␤# expected: A.new(b => [1, 2, 3])␤#      got: A.new(b => [[1, 2, 3],])␤»
[05:48:19] <SmokeMachine> or does it?!
[05:50:44] <SmokeMachine> m: use Test; class A { has @.b }; my @b = 1,2,3; my $c = @b; is-deeply A.new(:b($c)), A.new(:@b); is-deeply A.new(:b($c<>)), A.new(:@b)
[05:50:44] <camelia> rakudo-moar d7152ea59: OUTPUT: «not ok 1 - ␤# Failed test at <tmp> line 1␤# expected: A.new(b => [1, 2, 3])␤#      got: A.new(b => [[1, 2, 3],])␤ok 2 - ␤»
[05:51:50] <SmokeMachine> it seems it doesn't work if the array is itemised and works if it isn't...
[05:52:08] <SmokeMachine> (but inside a hash it will alway be itemised...)
[05:53:33] <SmokeMachine> I think that makes sense to be that way... but how should one have an hash with the parameters (with an array between them) and make it work?
[05:55:26] <SmokeMachine> m: use Test; class A { has @.b }; my @b = 1,2,3; my %a = :b(|@b); is-deeply A.new(|%a), A.new(:@b) # should this split expand and make it work?

[20:20:02] <tbrowder> tonyo: how do we use fez for community modules? what user credentials? or do we have to adopt?
[20:20:51] <tonyo> you can adopt but if you wait a couple of weeks the groups portion should be done being tested and i will update fez with the functionality
[20:21:11] <tonyo> can't join or manage groups yet with it so it's kind of useless
[20:21:37] <tbrowder> i don't want to adopt, but i can PR and merge it, thnx

[22:18:44] <tbrowder> the --multi option requires one perl module
[22:19:28] <tbrowder> his module has been fixed to use the new github gist token format
