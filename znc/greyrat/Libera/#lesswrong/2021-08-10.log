[00:00:30] <galambo> I think my opinion on covid changed dramatically when I heard greg cochran's interviews with james miller in early february
[00:01:08] <gwern> did you use the mask?
[00:03:11] <galambo> gwern, I posted this on 29 february when I finally received the mask
[00:03:22] <galambo> < galambo> I have a 7502 respirator but it looks ridiculous
[00:04:07] <galambo> I bought disposable ffp masks when I realised I could not feasibly wear it
[00:04:16] <galambo> but their prices had come up on ebay at the time
[00:05:30] <galambo> gwern, what did you do?
[00:05:37] <galambo> what did you guys do
[00:06:38] <kuudes> I isolated for 4 weeks
[00:06:40] <two2thehead> surgical masks for daily outside use, we bought cloth masks at the beginning when the surgical masks were in short supply at the beginning
[00:06:47] <kuudes> but that was only after it already was here
[00:07:01] * two2thehead checks his calendar
[00:07:08] <two2thehead> more than a year and a half of this mess
[00:07:21] <kuudes> I bought ffp3 for my elderly relative who was undergoing radiation therapy
[00:07:34] <kuudes> this is the month it seems to go through here now
[00:07:41] <kuudes> it seems they are not stopping it anymore

[00:13:02] <shawwwn> galambo: fwiw, it took some years for people in general to realize that buy and hold was the winning strategy
[00:13:09] <shawwwn> I made the same mistakes
[00:13:25] <shawwwn> At least you only lost 30% of your parent’s money instead of 100%
[00:13:26] <kuudes> I managed to buy it much later, procrastrinated a couple of years
[00:13:52] <gwern> it's funny because 'HODL' is such a midwit-example. HODL / actively trade and rebalance / HODL
[00:14:40] <mst> kuudes: he won't know what you said, I restricted the extraction I did for him to only things he'd said
[00:14:55] <kuudes> oh
[00:15:06] <kuudes> sorry then, I have to grep my own logs I suppose :)
[00:15:55] <galambo> shawwwn, just to clarify I lost 30% in the transaction fees from egyptian pounds to bitcoin
[00:16:05] <mst> fairly sure we weren't showing up in each others' logs at all at the time so I don't think I can offer to parse mine anyway :D
[00:16:23] <shawwwn> galambo I hear <words>
[00:16:30] <shawwwn> And understand about as much
[00:16:45] <kuudes> indeed indeed ^_^;
[00:17:18] <mst> 'getting from a non-mainstream currency to being able to buy stuff on an exchange can involve a loss of a non-trivial percentage of the funds in the process'
[00:17:26] <mst> is how I understand it
[00:18:08] <kuudes> I would not think conversion cost from developing country currency to developed country currency of 30% would be very unexpected
[00:18:31] <kuudes> I mean, there usually are protectionist stuff that sort of makes the domestic currency to be in disparity with the foreign currency
[00:18:36] <kuudes> fudge stuff
[00:18:56] <kuudes> currency exchange tax could be a decent protectionist measure I suppose :-p
[00:19:54] <galambo> I think I bought something akin to a gift card that could be redeemed for in-game currencies for some games
[00:20:31] <galambo> then found that some weird exchange accepts this gift card thingy as payment
[00:20:37] <galambo> for bitcoin

[02:20:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> I haven't read it and don't plan to, but Prescod-Weinstein is generally regarded by physicists as being both (a) crazy, and (b) a person to fear, since she (?) is an uber-woke activist extraordinaire.

[02:20:29] <Obormot\Arcturus>  critical to a proper understanding of relativity, or similar. Just saying - don't read it with the objective of understanding something new about science (other than, perhaps, how someone seemingly insane can avoid getting drummed out of the field because everyone else is too terrified to point out that the stuff being said is, in fact, insane).

[03:55:31] <kuudes> thanks
[03:55:34] <gwern> if the LSAT is now 100% verbal, then that's pretty redundant and neglects the undoubted benefit to careers of quanitative ability
[03:55:41] <adiabatic> medical doctors here in the US are however many years med school is after you get your batchelor's
[03:56:20] <gwern> (ie if you take additional scores/info on math, then that gets you some additional information on IQ, and also math ability is doubtless useful itself downstream if you are optimizing for alumni careers, earnings, donations etc)
[03:59:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Much of that training exists merely to reduce competition. My view of the legal profession is that being a lawyer should be an undergraduate program rather than a master's degree." "As an attorney I agree it could be an undergraduate program. Realistically I think that would never happen, but maybe eventually 3 year programs can be converted into 2 and eventually 1 year programs which would be much more appropriate. "
[03:59:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> "I'd estimate a supermajority of the lawyers I've had similar discussions with agree that law could (and should) be an undergraduate program, and most everyone agrees that it could be two years (instead of three) without much loss. At the same time, virtually no one expects that to happen.
[03:59:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> I think that sort of thing explains a lot about how cost disease happens. "

[04:04:35] <ggreer> it seems like employers still want to know how good potential hires are, so there must be some demand for a standardized test. but it has to be a standardized test without getting smeared as "omg racist". not sure how to give employers what they actually want while still giving them what they claim they want

I am not familiar enough with the variations to answer that, also three things: (a) it's not really "Russian" so much as it is "Soviet", (b) the plov I know best is the one my grandmother makes, and she makes it better than anyone else I've seen but also a bit differently, (c) there's probably a difference between "plov as made in generic-Soviet-cuisine eatery", "plov as made in authentic [
[05:05:35] <Obormot\Arcturus>  Tajik / Uzbek / whatever] restaurant", "plov as made by my grandmother who learned it from Tajiks in Dushanbe or wherever", "plov as made by some actual Tajiks in Dushanbe or wherever", etc.
[05:06:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> (e.g. my grandmother typically makes it with chicken, which is non-standard, though she's also done beef or lamb instead sometimes and imo that is not as good ... etc.)

[05:34:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> "It appears to have been first created in the United States. To what degree Jasmati is derived from its etymological parent grains is unknown and disputed.[1] [2] The patent for Jasmati, registered in 1993 by the Texas-based corporation, RiceTec, had legal implications for Thai and Indian farmers who rely heavily on the exports of the parent crops, and caused controversy. Presently the debate seems to have cooled down. As the
[05:34:55] <Obormot\Arcturus>  degree to which Jasmati draws from Jasmine cannot be ascertained,[3] the informed consumer should be aware that it is therefore a different grain and may or may not be a complete substitute for either Jasmine or basmati. This suggests that Jasmati may have its own unique merits as a cooking ingredient. "

[06:28:55] <gwern> what's the computational complexity of forward autodiff?
[06:29:15] <shawwwn> seems the same as an inference pass
[06:29:47] <gwern> that sounds wrong... is that for a *single* parameter or something?
[06:30:29] <shawwwn> the memory requirements are 2x, because you need a number and its dual for every parameter
[06:30:41] <shawwwn> the dual is simply the gradient
[06:31:26] <shawwwn> forward autodiff is "computing the gradient at every step" -- e.g. if you compute  x^2, it also computes 2x for the dual
[06:31:50] <shawwwn> so there's no memory requirement of storing tensors for the backwards pass. In fact, there is no backwards pass
[06:32:48] <shawwwn> it's remarkably hard to find simple information about this topic. https://towardsdatascience.com/forward-mode-automatic-differentiation-dual-numbers-8f47351064bf is overcomplicated, but sort of gets the idea across.
[06:33:00] <feepbot> Forward Mode Automatic Differentiation (AD) is one of the driving forces behind the success story of Deep Learning. It allows us to efficiently calculate gradient evaluations for our favorite composed functions…
[06:33:38] <gwern> 'There are 2 modes for automatic differentiation for computing MG and DG: 1. Reverse more accumulation: During each iteration of SGD, evaluate MG first. Compute the loss and then compute the DG on the way back to compute the gradient using the loss. Then the weights are adjusted and the next iteration is performed. Computing DG on the way back is exactly the backpropagation. 2. Forward mode...
[06:33:44] <gwern> ...accumulation: Evaluate DG along with MG in each iteration. At the end of the forward step, DG is also available. The gradient can then be applied and the next iteration can be started. Do note that with either reverse mode or forward mode, the end result is the same — the value of the gradient computed is the same. But the difference is the cost of computation. Why so? Matrix-matrix...
[06:33:50] <gwern> ...operations in the forward accumulation mode are more expensive than matrix-vector operations in the reverse accumulation mode (O(n³) vs O(n²) respectively.). As a rule of thumb, if n > m (i.e, inputs are more than outputs), then backpropagation is more efficient. Otherwise, forward mode accumulation would be better. Therefore, while designing your neural net, you must carefully choose...
[06:33:52] <shawwwn> looks like https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/autodiff_cookbook.html has some details about the tradeoffs: 
[06:33:52] <shawwwn> > These two functions compute the same values (up to machine numerics), but differ in their implementation: jacfwd uses forward-mode automatic differentiation, which is more efficient for “tall” Jacobian matrices, while jacrev uses reverse-mode, which is more efficient for “wide” Jacobian matrices. For matrices that are near-square, jacfwd probably has an edge over jacrev.
[06:33:56] <gwern> ...your gradient computation algorithm that is most efficient for your application. In many popular neural nets today, the outputs are far less than the inputs, and hence backpropagation is more popular.' https://medium.com/deep-dives-into-computer-science/like-backpropagation-is-there-forward-propagation-as-well-fedb22828b36 ah
[06:33:56] <Robomot> The role of automatic differentiation in machine learning | by Kiran Achyutuni | Deep Dives into Computer Science | Medium (Backpropagation is fundamental to machine learning. It is a technique for computing the gradient of a function. Given there is a technique called backpropagation, one wonders if there is a technique…)
[06:33:57] <shawwwn> PASTE BATTLE
[06:34:09] <gwern> so if you are feeding in, say, 1024^3 inputs to get out 1 output, you want backwards mode
[06:34:44] <gwern> hm... when in DL do we feed in fewer inputs than outputs?
[06:34:49] <shawwwn> I was just wondering that.
[06:35:07] <shawwwn> "outputs" quickly becomes huge, especially if it's an image.
[06:35:19] <gwern> generative models, potentially? like, a G in a GAN? the output image is bigger than the _z_
[06:36:18] <shawwwn> even if it wasn't, it seems like you could compress pretty much anything into a smaller _z_
[06:36:19] <gwern> they compute the same gradient, so if you did forward mode on the G, then it'd still be compatible with backwards mode on the D, assuming the library can handle mixed models
[06:36:30] <nshepperd2> the outputs when training an image is the loss function
[06:36:35] <nshepperd2> image generator
[06:36:38] <nshepperd2> that's a scalar
[06:36:56] <gwern> oh. because the D collapses the 'output' back down into 1 scalar
[06:39:02] <shawwwn> hm? no
[06:39:08] <shawwwn> G's output is clearly the full image
[06:39:11] <shawwwn> D's output is a scalar, yeah
[06:39:27] <nshepperd2> you don't minimize G's output, you minimize the loss function
[06:40:23] <nshepperd2> if for some reason you wanted to compute that actual jacobian of G, then yeah, you'd want forward mode. but nobody ever needs to do that
[06:40:32] <shawwwn> hm.
[06:41:02] <gwern> there are GAN formulations which do the loss function on each pixel. would that work?
[06:41:04] <nshepperd2> (except when you're training a normalizing flow probability model, in which case the output of G has to be the same size as the input, so it wouldn't matter whether you use forward or backward mode)
[06:41:09] <shawwwn> that still feels wrong. I'm probably mistaken, but if that were true, it seems like you could use forward mode for the G part and backwards mode for the D part
[06:41:51] <gwern> yeah, that's what I said, but I'd bet that the libraries just don't support something weird like that
[06:41:53] <shawwwn> which would be a net savings
[06:42:03] <nshepperd2> you could do that but it would be way more expensive and pointless
[06:42:07] <shawwwn> (JAX does :) jaxfwd)
[06:42:21] <nshepperd2> using forward mode on G yields the entire jacobian of G
[06:42:21] <shawwwn> why would it be more expensive? that's the part I don't understand
[06:42:26] <nshepperd2> which you don't need
[06:42:45] <shawwwn> you don't need the jacobian of G to backprop through G?
[06:42:55] <nshepperd2> for minimizing the loss function, you only need the jacobian-vector product J(G) x grad(D)
[06:43:27] <nshepperd2> which is way more efficiently computed directly with backward mode
[06:43:29] <shawwwn> but G needs to be trained too, not just D.
[06:43:36] <nshepperd2> without ever materializing the jacobian
[06:44:09] <shawwwn> so of course you'd need to compute the gradient of each parameter of G with respect to the loss function, too
[06:44:19] <nshepperd2> yes, of course
[06:44:31] <shawwwn> then why don't you need G's jacobian?
[06:44:48] <nshepperd2> because you don't
[06:44:48] <shawwwn> in fact, I don't even remember what a jacobian is. That's probably step one.
[06:44:57] <shawwwn> fine
[06:45:01] <shawwwn> leave the jacobian behind. see if it cares
[06:45:47] * shawwwn re-studies https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/autodiff_cookbook.html
[06:45:48] <nshepperd2> gwern: even with individual pixel loss, you just add all the losses together
[06:45:55] <nshepperd2> so the result is still a scalar

[06:53:02] <nshepperd2> about me not being able to understand jax.lax.gather
[06:53:20] <shawwwn> well, what would you like to know about jax.lax.gather?
[06:53:54] <nshepperd2> how to use it lol
[06:56:05] <shawwwn> you don't use it directly. Just index into a tensor
[06:56:16] <shawwwn> like you would in numpy
[06:56:49] <shawwwn> lax is the lower layer -- it's almost a 1 to 1 correspondence between lax and xla ops
[06:57:10] <shawwwn> jax is a high level interface over lax. so think of lax as ASM and jax as python (because, incidentally, it is)

[07:00:49] <shawwwn> the real truth is that anything you're curious about, you should look at the jaxpr dumps for. It's jax.make_jaxpr(fn)(args go here) I believe
[07:01:01] <shawwwn> and if you're really curious, you should look at the HLO dumps, which I forget how to dump off hand

[07:44:22] <nshepperd2> gosh
[07:44:29] <shawwwn> but, basically
[07:44:47] <nshepperd2> having to repeat the indices array is pretty bad

[07:45:44] <shawwwn> so think of each axis slice separately
[07:46:22] <nshepperd2> ah, concatenating it with an enumeration of the batch dimensions
[07:47:16] <shawwwn> if it makes sense to you, then you're ahead of me.
[07:47:32] <shawwwn> the only thing I keep telling myself is "at least I haven't had to do this yet; maybe this is just a contrived example"
[07:47:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: So yeah, you actually got it right in one place and totally wrong in another
[07:47:49] <shawwwn> but at least there does exist a mapping from pytorch gather to jax indexing, even if it's ... obscure
[07:47:58] <shawwwn> I'll have to sit down and write a converter
[07:48:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: ` a[href*="haskell.org"]:not([href$='.hs'])::after` is the form you want (replacing the plain `a[href*="haskell.org"]`)

[07:49:43] <feepbot> Snippet | IRCCloud
[07:50:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> (also it needs the "case-insensitive" flag, of course)
[07:50:32] <nshepperd2> i'd rather a converter from equations. there's a lot that pytorch gather can't do either
[07:50:57] <shawwwn> nshepperd2: that's interesting. Can you give me a concrete example?
[07:51:45] <shawwwn> e.g. output[i, j] = input[i, index[i, j, 0], index[i, j, 1]] ?
[07:51:55] <nshepperd2> that would be an example
[07:53:02] <shawwwn> .. can you humor my lack of intelligence and expand it out into a concrete "here's a result; here's an input" with actual numbers?
[07:53:12] <shawwwn> (and here's an index array)
[07:54:35] * shawwwn just writes it in python
[07:58:56] <nshepperd2> input = [[[1,2],[3,4]],[[5,6],[7,8]]]; input.shape = [2,2,2]; index = [ [[0,0]], [[1,1]] ]; output = [[1], [8]]
[07:59:01] <shawwwn> apparently this https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/k5gNjn4s/
[07:59:12] <feepbot> Snippet | IRCCloud
[08:00:46] <shawwwn> hmm
[08:01:05] <shawwwn> so it seems like one way a converter could work, would be to write it in python (how I did in that snippet above), and then track each array index access
[08:01:30] <shawwwn> and at the end, try to convert those index accesses / array writes into a single (or small number of) indexes and updates
[08:02:14] <shawwwn> that last step is the hard part.
[08:03:45] <nshepperd2> I was hoping that if I figured how that whole GatherDimensionNumbers thing works, i could write a converter by directly translating the expression for each dimension index in the inputs array

[08:04:42] <shawwwn> well, I'd like to help figure it out with you

[08:17:26] <SDr> okay, write up a piece: https://pastebin.com/DSvDdQK7   <- email to apple.  would you mind double-checking it to see if all points come across?
[08:17:27] <Robomot> Dear Apple,Many times Apple customer here. I'm writing to you in response to - Pastebin.com (Pastebin.com is the number one paste tool since 2002. Pastebin is a website where you can store text online for a set period of time.)
[08:17:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well, "many times Apple customer here" is not idiomatic English at all...
[08:18:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> "contest with maximum prejudice" is also a phrase that doesn't make sense
[08:18:28] <shawwwn> SDr: ah. I'm sorry for giving you a hard time earlier. I didn't realize your protest was on moral grounds
[08:18:37] <shawwwn> it would help to mention such things
[08:19:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> "There is a very bright line, a Chesterton's Fence that you've crossed here" is mixing metaphors; one does not *cross* Chesterton's fences, one *knocks them down* (or, leaves them standing, I guess)

[08:23:44] <shawwwn> it's worth thinking carefully of a solid example.
[08:24:40] <shawwwn> your letter also needs to hone in on the distinction between scanning locally, and scanning locally photos *which are then uploaded to icloud*
[08:24:52] <shawwwn> the former is a privacy intrusion. The latter is not. And Apple is doing the latter.

[08:25:54] <shawwwn> though I see your last few paragraphs do contain some quotes that do make that distinction
[08:26:29] <nshepperd2> i'd wanna mention that it's actually illegal to install malware on peoples' phones
[08:26:39] <shawwwn> Oh, interesting. line 12 is actually a full quote from apple
[08:26:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> SDr: Ok, well, my comment on this letter is that the highly technical and *obscure* jargon is going to pretty much eliminate any chance of anyone taking this missive seriously
[08:26:59] <rmmh> how long until apple labels all detractors pedos
[08:26:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Also, typo: substitue)
[08:27:19] <shawwwn> I didn't find the jargon particularly unclear, for what it's worth. Nor particularly technical
[08:27:30] <gwern> if you were going to bother writing it at all, it should be an open letter. let's face it, there is precisely 0% chance of apple doing anything in response to this letter, as they will have considered all this well in advance and chose to do it anyway
[08:28:25] <shawwwn> I don't think gwern's point is true. Tim Cook has been known to reply to letters like these.
[08:28:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> That too
[08:28:30] <shawwwn> the chance is near zero, but it's not precisely zero
[08:29:07] <shawwwn> and "they've considered this, so don't send it" is stupid. paying customers should say why they're no longer paying customers. Gwern himself has done this
[08:29:50] <gwern> shawwwn: and it works even better if they know other customers are reading it
[08:30:12] <shawwwn> I might be willing to sign an open letter, fwiw. But I'd have to be persuaded first
[08:30:21] <shawwwn> my hangup is, every argument here could equally apply to photos in the cloud
[08:30:30] <rmmh> they'll probably put out a letter in a month about how they'll make extra certain that the code is locked to only scan icloud uploads, they promise
[08:30:37] <shawwwn> I don't understand why apple chose to do it device-local, but it seems to me that they could've equally done it cloud-remote.
[08:31:02] <shawwwn> after all, it's hash-matching.
[08:31:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> So what explains the apparent increase in hysteria about pedophilia and "child sexual abuse" and so on in recent years?
[08:31:07] <rmmh> shawwwn: icloud doesn't (generally) have your crypto keys
[08:31:12] <rmmh> it's not hash matching, either
[08:31:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> This shit seems to be getting more and more insane all the time - why?
[08:31:15] <nshepperd2> if they do it cloud remote it makes a mockery of the claim that they are encrypted an inaccessible
[08:31:33] <rmmh> oh wait they gave up on E2E icloud crypto
[08:31:47] <shawwwn> (they could do it with fully homomorphic encryption)
[08:31:55] <nshepperd2> no they couldn't
[08:31:59] <rmmh> The encryption keys are stored on Apple’s own servers in Cupertino. Without these encryption keys, no one can decrypt anything. The thing is, the encryption keys are readily accessible if one has access to the user’s Apple ID account (as in knowing the login and password and being able to pass two-factor authentication). If a third party gains control over the user’s Apple ID/iCloud
[08:32:01] <rmmh> account, they can download and decrypt information.

[08:32:45] <shawwwn> (I meant "could" theoretically, not practically. :)
[08:32:58] <nshepperd2> they couldn't do it theoretically either
[08:33:06] <gwern> rmmh: not quite that bad! you can actually do a surprising amount these days. like you can run whole real neural networks like CNNs
[08:33:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> SDr: "longtime" is the word you want, as in, "longtime Apple customer"
[08:33:19] <shawwwn> cut the comma after "FAQ" on line 12
[08:33:23] <nshepperd2> homomorphic encryption would yield an encrypted result which is useless
[08:33:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Or is it hyphenated? I always forget)
[08:33:31] <gwern> nshepperd2: not to the customer
[08:33:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/longtime nope I was right the first time
[08:33:43] <Robomot> Longtime | Definition of Longtime by Merriam-Webster (Longtime definition is - having been so for a long time : long-standing. How to use longtime in a sentence.)
[08:34:30] <nshepperd2> gwern: indeed, but the customer is hardly gonna feel like reporting themselves to NCMEC
[08:34:56] <shawwwn> > Furthermore, by opening up Pandora's box of client-side checking, you have signalled for other companies to follow suit.
[08:34:56] <shawwwn> 1. "signalled" is a typo; it's "signaled"
[08:34:56] <shawwwn> 2. don't other companies already do this?
[08:35:53] <gwern> nshepperd2: you could have the customer's device upload the executable to run remotely, and ship the result back, and then the device tattles
[08:36:33] <shawwwn> eh. that's basically the same thing.
[08:36:48] <nshepperd2> yeah you could do that. seems like pointless complication though
[08:36:55] <nshepperd2> if you're already install malware
[08:36:57] <gwern> nshepperd2: ie my iphone uploads a cryptoblob to apple's icloud, which runs the cryptoblob on my cryptodata, sends back a mystery 0/1, and my iphone decrypts it, and tattles if 'CP==TRUE'. my data, despite being in the cloud, is always 100% encrypted, and nothing *can* be leaked other than the presence/absence of CP
[08:36:58] <shawwwn> "local content matching by any other name smells just as rancid" and all that.
[08:37:09] <gwern> nshepperd2: and this can run on more data than even fits on my iphone
[08:37:28] <shawwwn> gwern: people's whole problem here is that your phone tattles
[08:37:30] <shawwwn> rather than the cloud
[08:37:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> "In a company-wide internal letter to Apple employees in response, NCMEC’s executive director of strategic partnerships Marita Rodriguez described the criticism as the “screeching voices of the minority.”[39]" ... nice, nice
[08:37:56] <gwern> shawwwn: well sure, but it does at least respect your icloud privacy more than "we'll just store it all encrypted with our own keys, trust us"
[08:38:01] <nshepperd2> gwern: yeah, i guess this would enable you to screw over the customer even more by not even telling them which picture allegedly matches
[08:38:23] <galambo__> after reading this letter, I wonder if I should switch from windows to linux
[08:38:47] <gwern> nshepperd2: sure. if you wanted to, I assume you could ship back per file bits, or maybe a tree
[08:38:56] *** galambo__ is now known as galambo
[08:39:01] <shawwwn> look
[08:39:15] <shawwwn> the iCloud choice isn't merely a policy decision
[08:39:19] <shawwwn> you've opted to surrender your photos to iCloud
[08:39:29] <shawwwn> the fact that your phone does the legwork of the matching changes nothing about your decision there.
[08:39:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Apple’s idealized outcome solves a lot of seemingly intractable problems. On one hand, CSAM is horrific and Apple hasn’t been doing anything about it" ... why should Apple do anything about "it"?? It's not Apple's job! Even the critics are conceding the most absurd points
[08:40:13] <shawwwn> it's completely equivalent to deciding to develop your photos at a local film store, and then the film store bringing a person to your house to look through the negatives with a little scope before carrying the photos off to the store
[08:40:34] <shawwwn> yes, it happens in your house. But no, that's not an invasion of privacy, because you've *opted into it*
[08:40:51] <shawwwn> that's why I don't get this.
[08:41:19] <shawwwn> the idea that we can't trust apple when they say "the scanning is off when iCloud sync is off" seems ludicrous. If that were true, then we can't trust them when they say anything whatsoever
[08:41:20] <feep_> no you're right, it's a concession of privacy
[08:41:45] *** feep_ is now known as feep
[08:41:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Even the problem is defined in a totally Orwellian manner: "child sexual abuse material" is vague enough that it can be pretty much *anything*, and the notion that the *existence* of "child sexual abuse material" is itself, directly, a problem, is completely insane given that vagueness)
[08:42:09] <shawwwn> it means when children get raped, obormot
[08:42:10] <nshepperd2> i think it's just morally wrong to install code on someone's device whose only purpose is to harm the user
[08:42:14] <feep> that said, yes, you can't trust them when they say anything whatsoever
[08:42:19] <feep> this is news?
[08:42:26] <rmmh> CSAM is now the preferred term to CP
[08:42:42] <feep> rmmh: I don't understand why, CSAM is more restrictive than CP
[08:42:50] <shawwwn> it's probably not
[08:42:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Second, though, legitimate societal concerns about the needs of law enforcement and the radicalizing nature of the Internet should be taken seriously." ... no they shouldn't!
[08:43:21] <feep> I mean, to be clear, nitpicking aside, I'm in full agreement with obormot :p
[08:43:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: Only if you interpret it in a sane way, which is not the only interpretion of which the term admits
[08:43:37] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: that is fair
[08:43:43] <shawwwn> nshepperd2: do you feel it's morally wrong to install such code in a cloud service? I'm having trouble coming to terms with the distinction
[08:44:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> (And that ambiguity is very much the point)
[08:44:16] <shawwwn> because, again, even if it is on your device, it hinges on the extremely-important policy decision of you opting into a cloud service
[08:44:22] <nshepperd2> at least the other antifeatures iphones come with have some sort of rationalization about being necessary for security or something
[08:44:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Taking the slightly easier route, though — iCloud backups, Facebook messaging, etc. — means some degree of vulnerability that, let’s not forget, is sometimes justifiably leveraged. Law enforcement can get a warrant for those backups or chat logs, just as they can install a wire tap." wrong
[08:44:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> Police shouldn't be able to tap your phone either
[08:45:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or any of that other shit

[08:47:40] <nshepperd2> shawwwn: no because the company owns those cloud servers
[08:48:02] <shawwwn> that's an interesting point.
[08:48:43] <shawwwn> but unfortunately it changes nothing about the moral implications, because apple is running nothing on your device *unless* you opt into those cloud servers
[08:48:45] <nshepperd2> nominally you own your device. stallman would never install malware on someone else's computer
[08:49:24] <feep> yes, using a cloud service clearly means you consent to having your device scanned, that is how consent works
[08:49:25] <shawwwn> the phone has to run software to upload the photos to the servers too. at that point, the ethics don't change whether the hash matching happens on the phone or on their servers
[08:49:35] <nshepperd2> i don't think it's acceptable for call of duty to install malware either, even if you "opt into" it
[08:49:36] <feep> same as how having sex with someone means consenting to having them come into your house with no warning
[08:49:57] <shawwwn> if you don't consent to it, then don't consent to it. Right?
[08:50:05] <feep> right, just don't have sex with them
[08:50:24] <shawwwn> yes, that's generally the solution when someone is crossing boundaries, along with potentially removing them from your life
[08:50:29] <shawwwn> as SDr is doing.
[08:50:35] <feep> I support this conclusion. don't use apple lol

[08:54:27] <|dbotdan> Shawn Presser (@theshawwn, 2021-08-10 04:22): ‘The reason that was confusing is because, in order to train G, you're still taking the derivative of each parameter of G w.r.t. the loss function. | But I guess that the image output is an intermediate step, so it does make sense. It'll just take some time to think that way.’
[09:02:24] <shawwwn> nshepperd2: https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/02.07-fancy-indexing.html makes a pretty convincing case that the basic examples you were objecting to earlier get you pretty darn far
[09:02:26] <nshepperd2> shawwwn: to some extent the issue with local scanning is that this is just more of apple doubling down on being maximally anti-stallman. obviously, removing the malware the notifies NCMEC must never be permitted, which instantly provides justification of all sort of draconian anti-user-freedom measures
[09:02:36] <feepbot> Fancy Indexing | Python Data Science Handbook
[09:02:55] <shawwwn> can you think of a reason you'd want something like output[i,j] = input[i, index[i, j, 0], index[i, j, 1]] ? that's my only hangup with it
[09:02:58] <nshepperd2> maybe you can now accuse jailbreakers of being pedos and get the police to break their doors down
[09:03:03] <shawwwn> it seems dangerous to spend a lot of time on hypothetical desires
[09:04:33] <shawwwn> nshepperd2: that's another good point that I hadn't considered. But I'm not sure it follows that jailbreaking could become illegal
[09:04:58] <shawwwn> I was about to agree with you, but then I realized that circumventing apple's software is a ToS violation, not a law violation
[09:05:02] <nshepperd2> anything can follow with enough hysteria

[10:53:10] <shawwwn> okay, nshepperd2, help. My brain isn't working. How do you write a loss function that makes "all model parameters equal"? By that I mean, if you start with model params [1,2,3], you should eventually get [2,2,2] or something

[10:54:34] <nshepperd2> err, lambda t: (t - t.mean()).square().mean()

[11:03:13] <nshepperd2> jax.core.Tracer i guess
[11:03:31] <nshepperd2> cool
[11:03:32] <shawwwn> so yes, just bolt on whatever functionality you want onto jax.core.Tracer and jaxlib.xla_extension.DeviceArrayBase
[11:03:51] <shawwwn> you need jaxlib.xla_extension.DeviceArrayBase for the actual arrays jax returns, and jax.core.Tracer for all the intermediate tracing stuff it does for jit / grad
[11:04:07] <nshepperd2> i'll add that to my jaxtorch library
[11:04:11] <shawwwn> nice
[11:04:21] <shawwwn> jaxtorch is a good idea
[11:04:45] <shawwwn> one problem is that jax random functions require a random key
[11:05:00] <shawwwn> whereas torch functions don't. (I've been thinking about a jaxtorch type lib for a little while)
[11:05:32] <shawwwn> but it seems best to keep the API jax compatible, followed by torchlike (rather than reverse priority)
[11:06:17] <nshepperd2> i solve that by including the prng state in the context object which gets passed to the forward() function of every module
[11:06:41] <shawwwn> mm.
[11:07:23] <nshepperd2> my way seems to be way more jax compatible than whatever insane global mutability stuff flax/haiku do
[11:07:44] <shawwwn> that still implies that you need to pass "something" into each rng function, because otherwise you could make the context object global (haiku style) or just pass the key (jax style)
[11:07:51] <shawwwn> only global haiku-style would give you torch API
[11:08:09] <shawwwn> unless the context object is the thing that you call to get random tensors instead of torch.rand, which is still an API break
[11:08:46] <shawwwn> whereas there's nothing to pass into torch: torch.rand(2,2)
[11:08:48] <nshepperd2> i'm not really set on making the api 100% word for word compatible
[11:09:03] <nshepperd2> invoking cx.randn(2,2) is fine by me
[11:09:05] <shawwwn> nah, don't go for compatibility. go for simplicity
[11:09:13] <shawwwn> ah.
[11:10:30] <shawwwn> how do you handle parameter init? cx.get_variable("foo", init: cx.zeros)?
[11:10:48] <shawwwn> er, wow, my brain must really be mush tonight
[11:11:02] <shawwwn> self.foo = cx.get_variable("foo", init=lambda: cx.zeros(shape))
[11:11:20] <shawwwn> and then make cx inherit the model's scope
[11:11:38] <shawwwn> I guess it could be an actual Parameter object
[11:11:54] <nshepperd2> def __init__(self): self.weight = jaxtorch.init.normal(c1, c2)
[11:11:57] <shawwwn> but it'd still need access to the scope in order to properly name the var
[11:12:13] <shawwwn> what does jaxtorch.init.normal(c1, c2) return?
[11:12:18] <nshepperd2> self.weight is a Param object which just a. identifies the parameter b. says how to initialize it
[11:12:32] <shawwwn> yes, but how is the identification resolved?
[11:12:38] <shawwwn> that was the tricky part for me with tftorch
[11:12:54] <shawwwn> does model.__setattr__ set it?
[11:13:14] <nshepperd2> literally just using the object's id
[11:13:28] <shawwwn> lolwhat, no you can't. Ok I'll suspend my disbelief
[11:13:32] <shawwwn> but the names need to be torch-style
[11:13:49] <shawwwn> .get_state() or whatever would return dotted names
[11:14:12] <nshepperd2> yeah, every module has a named_parameters() function which returns a list of (recursively) all the params and their dotted names
[11:14:13] <shawwwn> "model.0.linear.b" or whatever
[11:15:01] <shawwwn> I had the same thing. But, what if someone wants to do computation in the constructor? There's no context object yet
[11:15:14] <shawwwn> in fact, jaxtorch.init.normal doesn't have a context object either
[11:15:21] <shawwwn> that was the problem I ran into
[11:15:41] <shawwwn> the Params object would need to support all computation, including the ability to wipe and set its values
[11:15:46] <shawwwn> modules can (and do!) do that
[11:15:52] <shawwwn> in the constructor, before the forward pass I mean
[11:16:05] <nshepperd2> the Param object contains a function which returns the initial value
[11:16:20] <nshepperd2> the function takes a rng key in case it needs it
[11:16:24] <shawwwn> is the context object passed to the model's constructor?
[11:16:28] <nshepperd2> no
[11:16:54] <shawwwn> so if there's no context object in the constructor, and the constructor requires the initial value, and randomness requires a random key, and the context object contains the random key, where does the random key come from?
[11:17:10] <shawwwn> (this isn't a contrived example; it's the usual)
[11:17:15] <nshepperd2> actual initialization, creating all the tensors, happens after you make the Module
[11:17:49] <shawwwn> I mean... if you want to concede not making it like torch, then sure, that works. But in torch, people initialize their tensors in the constructor, with randomness
[11:18:38] <shawwwn> and since initialization can be arbitrary, that means it needs access to the random key
[11:18:49] <nshepperd2> that barely makes any difference
[11:19:01] <shawwwn> oh?
[11:19:23] <nshepperd2> self.weight = torch.random.normal(4, 5) vs self.weight = jaxtorch.init.normal(4,5)
[11:19:40] <nshepperd2> you just defer the initialization by putting it in a lambda
[11:19:49] <shawwwn> self.weight = jaxtorch.init.normal(4,5) * 2.0
[11:19:52] <shawwwn> does this work?
[11:20:16] <nshepperd2> self.weight = Param(lambda key: jax.random.normal(4,5, key=key) * 2.0)
[11:21:00] <shawwwn> that runs into a different problem: what is self.weight after that expression?
[11:21:02] <shawwwn> er
[11:21:03] <shawwwn> self.weight.shape
[11:21:15] <shawwwn> (I ran into that one too.)
[11:21:48] <shawwwn> because code needs to know self.weight.shape in the constructor, before the forward pass (unfortunately)
[11:22:12] <nshepperd2> oyeah, self.weight = Param(lambda key: jax.random.normal(4,5, key=key) * 2.0, shape=[4,5])
[11:22:46] <nshepperd2> actually, I think it's currently, self.weight = Param(lambda shape, key: jax.random.normal(*shape, key=key) * 2.0, shape=[4,5]) but I'm not sure if I like it that way
[11:23:02] <shawwwn> yeah, it quickly gets ugly.
[11:23:19] <shawwwn> I think the right solution is for Param to be a jax Tracer, which supports all computation
[11:23:27] <nshepperd2> you could also just do Param(np.randn(4,5) * 2.0)
[11:23:28] <shawwwn> but that's harder and you punting is probably better.
[11:23:45] <shawwwn> you can't tho
[11:24:01] <shawwwn> because for huge GPT models, that will require huge amounts of system memory just to initialize it
[11:24:06] <shawwwn> I guess you'd need that anyway if you want to load from checkpoint
[11:24:24] <shawwwn> but then you'd need 2x that memory after initializing the model, during checkpoint loading
[11:24:31] <shawwwn> unless you only load one tensor from disk at a time
[11:24:37] <nshepperd2> huge amounts of system memory are way more readily available than gpu memory, lol
[11:25:01] <shawwwn> yes, but remember people will want to use this on their laptops. and 2x might be the difference between being able to load and inference vs crashing
[11:25:31] <nshepperd2> you can delete the initializers after using them
[11:25:32] <shawwwn> also, you have to be able to control the randomness using keys, for repeatable initializations across tpu pods
[11:25:59] <nshepperd2> do you really
[11:26:09] <shawwwn> probably not. that was the only contrived example I've used :(
[11:26:31] <nshepperd2> anyway, what you'd actually do is self.weight = jaxtorch.init.normal(4,5, stddev=2.0)
[11:26:35] <shawwwn> but sharding is still a bitch
[11:26:46] <shawwwn> yeah yeah, but that just raises the question of how jaxtorch.init.normal is implemented
[11:26:51] <shawwwn> it means that computation in the constructor is a requirement
[11:26:59] <shawwwn> what if the init depends on a different tensor's value? etc
[11:27:01] <nshepperd2> nope
[11:30:37] <nshepperd2> but yeah i guess if for some reason you ever want to do complicated init where multiple params depend on each other, you could pass a rng key to the constructor
[11:31:28] <nshepperd2> or better, have a separate init function which lets you modify the tensors after creation
[11:31:36] <nshepperd2> via the context object
[11:32:00] <Obormot\Gaia> quanticle: I read "Cyclopterus" ... man, Watts is really on a doomer kick, isn't he
[11:42:58] <shawwwn> nshepperd2: the more I think about it, the more I think computation should be supported in the constructor
[11:44:21] <shawwwn> and the more I think about it, the more it seems like the context object needs to be global
[11:44:35] <shawwwn> otherwise in the forward function, you'll have to pass it to every submodule
[11:44:50] <shawwwn> I think it should be passed to the constructor and stored in the model
[11:45:42] <shawwwn> that would solve both controllable random init, and the problem of having to pass it to every submodule in the forward function
[11:46:16] <shawwwn> your technique would look like self.linear(cx, self.linear2(cx, x)) instead of self.linear(self.linear2(x))
[11:46:52] <shawwwn> but if the context object is available in the constructor, then not only do you not need any Params object (because you can just create jax tensors immediately), but you can also pass it to submodules as you construct them
[11:47:46] <shawwwn> I still tend to favor the global approach though.
[11:48:35] <shawwwn> in main():
[11:48:35] <shawwwn> with jaxtorch.Context():
[11:48:35] <shawwwn>   mdl = MyModel()
[11:49:03] <shawwwn> you can even have a default Context() object, the way that tensorflow has a default Graph() object
[11:49:42] <shawwwn> I really think that controllable randomness is one of jax's strengths, and it may or may not be a bad idea to force everyone not to use it
[11:52:50] <kuudes> re that apple cp scanner
[11:52:57] <kuudes> a bit of background, if you guys will
[11:53:16] <kuudes> the issue is that in eu ePrivacy directive has expanded
[11:53:34] <kuudes> and now includes also cloud storage, I think
[11:54:01] <kuudes> ePrivacy bans eavesdropping any private comms without due legal court order etc
[11:54:29] <kuudes> so isps and telcos are not allowed to process call or sms or email or ip data or metadata but for transmitting the communication
[11:54:57] <kuudes> so this bans also current system where facebook and apple and google scan comms that go through them for cp
[11:55:10] <kuudes> and also where in the same point, likely nsa copies the comms as whole
[11:55:21] <kuudes> this alteration will likely at least hamper nsa much
[11:55:37] <kuudes> but think of the children, so cp should be still battled
[11:55:53] <kuudes> so currently the strongest solution proposition is this device side scanning
[11:56:51] <kuudes> as this would comply with eprivacy and gdpr, anything user does not consent is not stored on user system, and from user system anything is not output but in the case where there is proper cause / due suspicion
[11:57:29] <kuudes> so it is better than current, but still bad insofar that comms get scanned
[11:57:35] <nshepperd2> shawwwn: passing it to every submodule is preferable to it being global imo
[11:57:45] <kuudes> but at least it closes 1 large nsa loophole
[11:58:19] <kuudes> I think a major thing would be that eu customer icloud would be restricted to be hosted within eu.
[11:59:11] <nshepperd2> shawwwn: the point is to do this with a minimum of magic
[11:59:29] <shawwwn> nshepperd2: it's a mistake to do it with a maximum of code
[12:00:15] <shawwwn> there's a reason people like torch.rand(3,3) and can remember it, vs ???.rand(3,3) or jaxtorch.rand(ctx, 3, 3)
[12:00:31] <nshepperd2> nah
[12:00:42] <shawwwn> mm.
[12:08:29] <shawwwn> nshepperd2: in that case, I think you might need to pass the context object into both the constructor and the forward function (and each submodule individually in the forward function). Because the constructor would need controlled randomness (requiring an rng key) and arbitrary computation, and the forward function would also need randomness (e.g. dropout). I'm not sure the forward function can use the key state from construction 
[12:08:29] <shawwwn> time.
[12:09:12] <shawwwn> I'm not sure it can't, either. But storing the context object is stateful, which seems less good if you prefer passing the context object around
[12:09:52] <shawwwn> I really hate repetition, but if you don't mind it then you might want to hate statefulness. And storing the context in the constructor to use during the forward pass is pretty stateful
[12:10:43] <shawwwn> one case you should try to support, if you can: some easy way of storing tensors for use later. E.g. GPT K and V caching during sampling
[12:10:50] <shawwwn> it would be neat if the context object could somehow take care of that bookkeeping

[12:44:34] <nshepperd2> shawwwn: sure. so consider a function f : R^m -> R^n
[12:44:43] <shawwwn> ok
[12:45:21] <nshepperd2> in the case of training a neural network f would generally be your loss function, and m = number of parameters and n = 1
[12:48:04] <nshepperd2> the jacobian of f is like the "full" derivative of f, and it's a matrix containing the derivative of each element of the output wrt each element of the input. if you name the input and output at a specific point with y = f(x), the jacobian is J(f)_ij = d(y_i)/d(x_j)
[12:49:40] <nshepperd2> the jacobian is a matrix shaped like n × m
[12:49:55] <shawwwn> is n=1 because loss generally returns a scalar?
[12:50:11] <nshepperd2> yes, the loss is always a scalar
[12:50:25] <feep[work]> I want to write a blog post entitled "'XY Problem' Considered Harmful"
[12:50:27] <shawwwn> (not true for RL, since each action apparently has its own loss value; TIL)
[12:50:38] <feep[work]> it's ruining stackoverflow
[12:50:49] <nshepperd2> even for RL, you average together all the loss values
[12:50:53] <nshepperd2> and end up with a scalar

[12:52:57] <nshepperd2> yeah sometimes for things other than loss minimization you need jacobians of things where n > 1
[12:53:11] <nshepperd2> or otherwise derivetives of them
[12:53:16] <shawwwn> so in general though, the jacobian is a flat, 1 by m matrix, where m is the number of parameters
[12:53:18] <nshepperd2> anyway
[12:53:39] <nshepperd2> well, we'll keep it general and say n x m
[12:53:50] <nshepperd2> for our f : m -> n function
[12:54:10] <shawwwn> "why use n when 1 will do?" giggled the mad hatter, twirling in his seat
[12:54:22] <nshepperd2> because it's important to explain how n and m relate to the computation cost
[12:54:26] <shawwwn> ah
[12:54:42] <shawwwn> my hangup was, for forward and backward, n seems to be 1. Is that correct?

[12:55:25] <shawwwn> anyway, yes, with you so far
[12:55:25] <nshepperd2> for *neural network applications*, n is often 1
[12:55:34] <nshepperd2> this is a property of the function you're looking at

[12:56:22] *** Joins: Obormot\Sirius (~obormot@user/obormot)
[12:56:36] <nshepperd2> in the case of a neural network loss function, n = 1, which means the jacobian is actually a 1 x m row vector, it's the gradient
[12:57:12] <nshepperd2> and the gradient, which is the same as the jacobian for a function with scalar output, is what we need for gradient descent
[12:57:49] <nshepperd2> so the two things we have at our disposal for computing the jacobian are forward and backward autodiff
[12:59:12] <nshepperd2> by the way, there's a chain rule for jacobians. J(f . g) = J(f) J(g)
[12:59:55] <nshepperd2> which is sort of what both autodiff modes are based on
[13:00:51] <nshepperd2> anyway, what forward-mode autodiff actually does is computes a jacobian-vector product for us. it lets you compute J(f) v for some v
[13:02:05] <nshepperd2> that v is the dual part of the dual vector you pass in as input: f(x + vε)
[13:03:10] <nshepperd2> if you set your v to, say, [1,0,0,0,0....], then this basically computes the first column of the jacobian for you
[13:03:43] <nshepperd2> and that is why you need to do m passes with forward-mode to compute the jacobian
[13:04:02] <nshepperd2> one for each column
[13:05:33] <nshepperd2> similarly, backward-mode autodiff actually computes a vector-jacobian product for you. it lets you compute v J(f) for some v
[13:06:43] <nshepperd2> and again you can do multiple passes, one for each n, setting v  to [1,0,0,0...], [0,1,0,0...], ..., to compute all rows of the J(f)
[13:07:05] <nshepperd2> so  that requires n passes with backward-mode to compute the jacobian
[13:07:16] <shawwwn> I just don't quite see the leap from "if you set your v to, say, [1,0,0,0,0....], then this basically computes the first column of the jacobian for you" to "and that is why you need to do m passes with forward-mode to compute the jacobian"
[13:07:28] <nshepperd2> but! luckily in neural networks, n=1, so you only need one pass
[13:08:42] <nshepperd2> shawwwn, you do forward with v=[1,0,0,0...], then with v=[0,1,0,0,...], then with v=[0,0,1,0...], etc
[13:08:56] <nshepperd2> each time you get a different column of the jacobian
[13:09:03] <nshepperd2> of which there are a total of m
[13:18:09] <shawwwn> ah.
[13:18:15] <shawwwn> this was a lightbulb moment. Thank you
[13:18:26] <shawwwn> it clarifies the difference between jvp and vjp
[13:19:53] <nshepperd2> cool
[13:19:59] <shawwwn> If vjp is that conceptually trivial, though, why is it such a pain in the ass to scale memory usage? What I mean is, it almost seems trivial to evaluate vjp in two steps rather than one: the left half, then the right half
[13:20:06] <shawwwn> sure, it'd take two passes. But it'd be half the memory usage
[13:20:08] <shawwwn> or would it?
[13:21:52] <nshepperd2> mmm, i'm not sure what you mean by that
[13:21:58] <shawwwn> I guess not necessarily, since what you really need are the activations from the forward pass during the backwards pass
[13:22:09] <shawwwn> basically, I was trying to think of some convenient way to trade time for memory
[13:22:21] <shawwwn> you're in a situation where the TPU crashes due to oom. batch size is 1. now what?
[13:22:29] <shawwwn> (during training)
[13:22:51] <shawwwn> I was hoping that you could "just compute the gradient of one parameter at a time" for a factor of M memory usage savings
[13:24:36] <shawwwn> for example...
[13:24:36] <shawwwn> > and again you can do multiple passes, one for each n, setting v  to [1,0,0,0...], [0,1,0,0...], ..., to compute all rows of the J(f)
[13:24:36] <shawwwn> Since v is [1], that means we do [1] x J(f), which computes the entire first row of J(f). But I'm interested in understanding where, precisely, the memory requirements come into play
[13:24:39] <nshepperd2> gradient checkpointing is the closest thing to that i think
[13:25:16] <shawwwn> why though? how could it be true that computing the derivative of one teeny tiny parameter would require the same memory usage as computing the derivative of all parameters?
[13:25:22] <shawwwn> (without checkpointing)
[13:26:29] <nshepperd2> because a change in one parameter has ripple effects that affect pretty much all activations after that parameter is used
[13:27:29] <nshepperd2> like if you tweak one parameter in the 'key' weights of an attention block, it's gonna affect everything
[13:27:32] <shawwwn> can you think of a simple example to illustrate that? it would go along way to solidifying my theoretical understanding
[13:27:46] <nshepperd2> because the whole attention matrix is gonna be slightly different

[13:30:08] <shawwwn> to guess wildly, does changing the key affect all the softmax outputs?
[13:30:15] <nshepperd2> yes, exactly
[13:31:27] <shawwwn> so, tying it all together
[13:31:48] <nshepperd2> K_bthr is gonna have at least one difference for each t, which means W_bhtt is gonna be slightly different for every t, which means the softmax outputs will be different which means the resulting A_bts will be slightly different in every value

[13:32:12] *** Quits: galambo_ (galambo@user/galambo) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[13:32:19] <shawwwn> why is the entire softmax activation during the forward pass necessary to compute the jacobian of just a single float of K, for example?
[13:32:50] <nshepperd2> so you're going to have to hold onto all the activations after that black to track all the effects on loss back to that one parameter
[13:32:56] <shawwwn> hm.
[13:33:00] <shawwwn> I see.
[13:33:08] <shawwwn> so it's the depth of the network that determines the memory requirements
[13:33:24] <nshepperd2> yes
[13:33:25] <shawwwn> therefore, it must be a little more efficient to only train the last few layers
[13:33:33] <shawwwn> well, a lot more efficient
[13:34:01] <shawwwn> so if one was looking to train a mega-model even if you're ooming, one could do it by freezing the first K layers
[13:34:15] <shawwwn> rather than freezing the parameters layer-wise
[13:34:17] *** Joins: Dyo (~Dyo@host.sedf.de)
[13:34:18] <nshepperd2> yeah, if you want to, you can train extremely deep networks by just continuously adding new layers and training them to convergence
[13:34:28] <nshepperd2> at the end of the network
[13:34:36] <nshepperd2> and have basically O(1) memory usage
[13:34:37] <shawwwn> heh.
[13:35:01] <shawwwn> what about in a GPT, where the stupid vocab embedding shows up at the start and the end?
[13:35:15] <shawwwn> guess you can try training the vocab embedding to convergence first, and then freeze it
[13:35:34] <nshepperd2> just use a different embedding for the start and end, lol
[13:36:02] <nshepperd2> minGPT does it that way, nothing stopping you
[13:36:05] <shawwwn> you could, but... that'd require another 50257x1600, which is a hefty boi
[13:36:25] <shawwwn> it always seemed stupid as hell that the vocab embedding dim needed to match the model embedding dim
[13:36:38] <shawwwn> seems like it could be 50257x128, then 128x1600
[13:37:21] <shawwwn> which would only need 8% as many parameters
[13:38:10] <shawwwn> so, the only remaining blind spot in my understanding (ha, I wish) is why the activation from the forward pass is necessary to compute the gradient during the backwards pass
[13:38:13] <nshepperd2> that would make the logits rank constrained. which is theoretically a bottleneck for prediction quality but in practice idk if anyone knows how much of a bottleneck it actually is
[13:39:00] <shawwwn> oh, it's because activations aren't reversible
[13:39:12] <shawwwn> if they were, then you wouldn't need to store the forward activations
[13:39:19] <shawwwn> hence reversible layers
[13:39:51] <shawwwn> obviously for x * y + z, you can't recover x unless you know z and y in advance
[13:40:01] <nshepperd2> yeah hence all those complicated papers on making reversible resnets and stuff so that you can recompute the activations in reverse order for the backward pass
[13:40:03] <shawwwn> though I'm not quite sure why you need to recover x in order to compute its gradient...
[13:40:46] <nshepperd2> d(x * y + z)/dx = y
[13:41:00] <nshepperd2> d(x * y + z)/dy = x
[13:41:21] <shawwwn> oh
[13:41:34] <shawwwn> and because chain rule, you need those in order to compute the actual gradient of model params
[13:41:50] <shawwwn> (assuming that x * y + z is an intermediate computation during the forward pass or something)
[13:42:04] <nshepperd2> that's pretty much it. pretty much every nn layer has its formula for the gradient which depends on the inputs in some way
[13:42:16] <shawwwn> I see
[13:42:39] <shawwwn> so what you're saying is, I need to implement the reversible computation theorized in https://theswissbay.ch/pdf/Gentoomen%20Library/Extra/Richard_P._Feynman-Feynman_Lectures_on_Computation__-Addison-Wesley%281996%29.pdf in JAX
[13:42:49] <shawwwn> that way there's no need for reversible layers

[15:06:21] <nshepperd2> see if there's substantial improvement from gpt-2
[15:16:28] <shawwwn> feep[work]: I think you need 1-by-50257 for the current token, and n-by-50257-by-n_heads-by-n_embd//n_heads for each K, V activation. Then you can swap each model param in from disk, if you want
[15:17:17] <shawwwn> so the theoretical minimum memory requirement is probably <100MB depending on how crazy you are
[15:18:09] <shawwwn> to actually *do* that, though, you'd need to get jax working on your system and start figuring out how to load tensors on demand during the forward pass
[15:18:44] <shawwwn> and by that I mean, simply "run jax", since that's already a description of how virtual memory works :P
[15:20:57] <shawwwn> nshepperd2: I'm writing up a thread on what you taught me. I was about to write "the theoretical minimum memory requirement for forward mode is sizeof(float32)*2, since you're computing each parameter one by one, and you only need memory for the parameter and its dual." But that can't be right. I need to account for the size of each activation, don'tI?
[15:22:02] <shawwwn> would it be true to say that the memory requirement is the maximum activation size during the forward pass? e.g. the activation with the biggest shape, times sizeof(float32), times 2 (because dual)
[15:22:04] <nshepperd2> it's more like sizeof(float32)*2*(the width of the most thicc layer)
[15:22:31] <shawwwn> hm.. why width, instead of np.prod(shape)?
[15:22:43] <nshepperd2> yes that's what i meant
[15:22:48] <shawwwn> ah
[15:23:39] <shawwwn> but the activation eventually collapses down to a shape of 1 (the loss output) right?
[15:23:55] <nshepperd2> yes
[15:24:06] <shawwwn> and at that point, the dual contains the gradient of the param wrt loss
[15:24:38] <shawwwn> does that mean each activation also has to have a dual, though?
[15:24:44] <nshepperd2> with forward mode, no, it wouldn't be the gradient
[15:24:56] <shawwwn> hm
[15:25:08] <nshepperd2> it would be a single element of the gradient
[15:25:38] <nshepperd2> corresponding to whichever dual vector you original initialized to 1 (with the rest of them set to 0)
[15:25:38] <shawwwn> oh, terminoogy fail. So the gradient is "the derivative of each parameter with respect to the loss"
[15:25:55] <shawwwn> I meant "gradient" as "the gradient of the current parameter wrt loss"
[15:26:08] <shawwwn> oh
[15:26:12] <nshepperd2> gradient = "the vector of derivatives of the loss with respect to each parameter"
[15:26:12] <PapuaHardyNet> shawwwn: I just want to confirm, did you claim that jax can run GPT-J on <100MB RAM theoretically?
[15:26:40] <shawwwn> PapuaHardyNet: if you're willing to swap parameters in from disk on demand, sure
[15:26:52] <PapuaHardyNet> huh, isn't that the same as using swap
[15:27:03] <PapuaHardyNet> except you are handling it instead of the OS
[15:27:09] <shawwwn> yes :)
[15:27:36] <nshepperd2> yes that's "it can run on <100MB" roughly in the same sense that "you can swim across the ocean"
[15:27:56] <shawwwn> well, for 16 tokens of output it shouldn't be too bad
[15:28:09] <kuudes> ocean is not very deep when near shore :D
[15:28:25] <shawwwn> or maybe it might be, since that's swapping 24GB per forward pass
[15:29:11] <shawwwn> (you can do a bit better by loading the bf16 weights and decoding them to fp32 once they're in memory, so, 12GB per forward pass)
[15:29:36] <nshepperd2> i suspect you might be better off swapping things to the NAS's memory over the network than to disk
[15:30:20] <kuudes> hmm, are there cheap usb ramdisks?
[15:31:43] <shawwwn> nshepperd2: does every operation with a dual result in a dual?  so therefore every activation would need 2*sizeof(float32), not just sizeof(float32). I was trying to think of some clever way of eliminating most of the dual overhead, since only one of the duals is initialized to 1
[15:31:57] <shawwwn> but I guess that's impossible
[15:32:45] <nshepperd2> yes, every operation involving a dual will result in a dual
[15:33:49] <nshepperd2> and just like my example with the attention block in backward-mode, all activations will be duals very quickly since they are affected by whichever parameter it is
[15:34:28] *** nshepper1 is now known as nshepperd
[15:35:13] <shawwwn> and makes no sense anyhow, since the dual part certainly doesn't stay 1 throughout the computation. never mind. (that's also a nice proof of why you need m passes though -- each activation is a dual wrt a *single* parameter, so if each block has a 1924x1600 activation, it needs those 1024x1600 duals in order to represent the derivative of a *single* parameter. So it needs m of those to do all the parameters, or 1 for one parameter 
[15:35:13] <shawwwn> at a time)
[15:35:22] <shawwwn> yeah. cool
[15:40:24] <nshepperd2> although be aware that the minimum memory will actually be more than the size of the biggest 'activation' if your network has a more complex topology than just a bunch of layers stacked on top of each other. like a resnet layer, resnet(x) = x + convolutions(x) or whateve
[15:41:13] <nshepperd2> the resnet layer needs to keep x in memory plus whatever the memory usage is for the calculation of the convolutions, obviously

[18:29:35] <[itchyjunk]> So i watched 2 bots. 1 was cleaning with a brush tool and one with a mop tool. both seemed to be using infrared to detect objects and generally travelling in a straight line
[18:29:48] <[itchyjunk]> wouldn't it be better if they tried to map their environment ?
[18:30:06] <[itchyjunk]> Every time you run them, they do the whole path finding stuff

[18:33:38] <[itchyjunk]> hmmm
[18:34:03] <[itchyjunk]> cheap as in they dont need additional hardware other than the infrared ?
[18:34:26] <[itchyjunk]> Can't they store the info from last clean cycle and use that as map?
[18:35:00] <[itchyjunk]> the little bots work, they go around cleaning. was just surprised that it didn't seem to map its local area
[18:36:09] <feep[work]> I mean, the map doesn't really benefit if you're running continuously
[18:36:23] <feep[work]> though some cleaning bots do keep a map
[18:36:27] <feep[work]> my neato does~
[18:36:29] <[itchyjunk]> hmm
[18:36:34] <[itchyjunk]> ah i see
[18:36:48] <[itchyjunk]> i guess it would be more expensive bots that do that maybe
[18:36:48] <feep[work]> but that makes sense cause it *needs* a persistent map, cause I can define exclusion zones in it.
[18:37:08] <[itchyjunk]> right, the exclusion zones is exactly why i thought maps would be nice
[18:37:23] <feep[work]> I think it depends on how you built your software to start.
[18:37:38] <feep[work]> if you started out like "we don't need maps, we can just drive random" I can imagine it being hard to retrofit them in
[18:38:09] <[itchyjunk]> that makes sense
[18:38:34] <[itchyjunk]> will it head more towards maps in future? Or there is no obvious gain from maps that you wouldnt get from random algos?
[18:39:00] <[itchyjunk]> although! it was supposidly supposed to find it's way back to its charging place

[19:02:16] <RiversHaveWings> "In a GAN, for example, I thought forward might be superior to backprop, because G outputs an image.

[21:08:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> Long-winded, yeah. Ornate, flowery, fanciful, totally. But *confusing*? Like, dude would routinely say the same thing like three or four times, in different ways, just to hammer it in for even the most dense reader
[21:08:50] <PapuaHardyNet> totally agree

[21:32:08] <two2thehead> danke shawwwn 
[21:32:21] <dbohdan> Nice
[21:33:00] <PapuaHardyNet> sweeet
[21:33:41] <dbohdan> (That "nice" was re: two2thehead's pun)

[21:34:53] <dbohdan> Obormot\Arcturus: Surely not what that person meant, but I think it is fair to call Moldbug's oeuvre as a whole confusing.  Over time his positive, prescriptive views seem to shift away from SovCorps to a much less cool traditional monarchy, and there is not a clear dividing line.  I don't remember him going "yeah, I've changed my mind" anywhere on UR.
[21:35:41] <two2thehead> dbohdan, ?
[21:35:57] <two2thehead> these guys look like vat grown twins
[21:36:15] <PapuaHardyNet> openai grows their own developers
[21:36:28] <dbohdan> two2thehead: "danke shawwwn" was a play on "danke schön", no?
[21:36:30] <PapuaHardyNet> way better than using leetcode for ensuring quality
[21:36:44] <two2thehead> no, but if anyone asks, YES, YES IT WAS! :V
[21:36:46] <shawwwn> what's a schon?
[21:37:00] <dbohdan> two2thehead: Heh
[21:37:08] <dbohdan> Obormot\Arcturus: Land made this point in a tweet recently: https://twitter.com/Outsideness/status/1413008247603163141
[21:37:13] <two2thehead> "In German, the phrase Danke schön is equivalent to the English expressions 'thank you very much' or 'thank you kindly'."
[21:37:19] <two2thehead> Knew that sounded familiar
[21:37:23] <|dbotdan> Outsideness (@Outsideness, 2021-07-08 05:33): ‘There's a Yarvin puzzle I can't click together whose central feature is Urbit being the practical demolition of the goofball monarchism at Gray Mirror.’
[21:38:48] <shawwwn> ha
[21:38:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> dbohdan: That's just him simplifying for the Substack audience
[21:40:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> dbohdan: As for Land's thing, well, that question would be a lot more pressing if Urbit, you know ... worked
[21:40:48] <dbohdan> Obormot\Arcturus: Maybe it's the target audience.  Land's explanation is more fun, though: https://twitter.com/Outsideness/status/1413039512268075011
[21:40:50] <|dbotdan> Outsideness (@Outsideness, 2021-07-08 07:37): ‘My (very charitable) take is that he's stripping all the decentralism out of GM in order not to cast shade on Urbit.’
[21:41:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> Heh
[21:41:48] <dbohdan> Someone may have to remake Urbit with Scheme or Wasm in place of Nock for it succeed
[21:42:35] <PapuaHardyNet> this is amazing
[21:43:04] <shawwwn> he wrote "the current Bicoin", not "the current Bitcoin price"
[21:43:33] <two2thehead> should be interesting to see if it compensates
[21:43:42] <dbohdan> Bicoin is just Hetcoin + Homcoin
[21:44:10] <two2thehead> feep, I'll give my left nut if this can make the adder software we discussed
[21:44:22] <two2thehead> adders software framework/algorithm/whatever
[21:45:16] <feep> two2thehead: I forgot what we talked about

[21:58:29] <feep> literally google monkaS smiley
[21:58:36] <feep> it's people doing twitch wrong, possibly ironically
[21:59:04] <two2thehead> So code-x can scale on a digital system, while gpt3 only works on analogue hardware ie the mind. 
[21:59:48] <PapuaHardyNet> that's a really interesting use of Codex. Imagine if a Desktop Environment had a clear ApI
[22:00:06] <PapuaHardyNet> voice recognition + codex + DE API gives us a really nice interface
