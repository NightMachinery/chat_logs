Cygwin Emacs uses outdated GnuTLS 3.6.9, and the above mentioned Cygwin packages workaround the problem by modifying the set of trust anchor certificates.

[04:18:16] <parsnip> introspection seems more apt
[04:18:39] <parsnip> like, your behavior is frustrating, and then you are frustrated with the outcome
[04:19:12] <twb> I'm pretty sure "gaslighting" is where Americans perform Zersetzung on their wives.
[04:19:45] <parsnip> twb: i think people use it more generally when someone annoys you then pretends they aren't

[04:21:06] <aidalgol> I feel that the term "gaslighting" has been used rather loosely in recent years.

[04:26:40] <skangas> parsnip: Yeah, I wrote one or two posts I think
[04:26:59] <acdw> what's shorthands?
[04:27:07] <skangas> New feature in Emacs 28.1
[04:27:15] <skangas> Poor-mans namespaces, to put it simply
[04:27:15] <acdw> oohhh
[04:27:26] <acdw> ohh, oh i see, yes i've seen some of those
[04:27:35] <skangas> Not exactly, but basically it's a symbol renaming mechanism that is different in each file
[04:27:35] *** Joins: JordiGH (~jordi@user/jordigh)
[04:27:58] <acdw> yeah i saw a thread on that i think. looks pretty confusing -- how do you know if a symbol is a shorthand or not?
[04:28:02] <corwin> Does RMS not like the name, only?  Or opposed to the feature (as implemented?)
[04:28:05] <skangas> So you can have something like "x-foo-bar" and because it starts with "x-" it's actually "some-very-long-package-name"
[04:28:11] <skangas> It works on the Lisp reader level
[04:28:14] <acdw> ahhh
[04:28:23] <parsnip> corwin: i think the email was just regarding the name
[04:28:30] <parsnip> there could be other emails
[04:28:31] <acdw> i just saw it with/out/ the prefix at all, so i had no idea wht the deal was
[04:28:32] <skangas> s/"some-very-long-package-name"/"some-very-long-package-name-foo-bar"/
[04:28:44] <acdw> wait, rms was sad about a name? wah
[04:28:53] <parsnip> i just did a word search for "shorthand" in "september"
[04:29:03] <skangas> corwin: RMS likes the feature
[04:29:04] <parsnip> looking for the beginning-ish of these threads
[04:29:15] <skangas> I'm not sure he said anything about the name though?
[04:29:28] <skangas> If he did, I must have missed that part
[04:29:36] <twb> just fucking implement namespaces and packages properly
[04:29:38] <twb> FFS
[04:30:05] <parsnip> twb: should they just do it "nice not twice"
[04:30:10] <corwin> skangas: wonderful.  fwiw, I do also.  seems like something that could help people use meaningful names, if they were resident because of e.g., what that does given line-length conventions.
[04:30:26] <twb> parsnip: Brooks says "build one to throw away"
[04:30:30] <JibStyle> I'm perfectly happy with the current convention of attaching a prefix to symbols in a package.
[04:30:40] <acdw> same
[04:30:41] <twb> parsnip: but, we already threw a lot of ones away before elisp started
[04:30:44] <parsnip> twb: is that like, be willing to break things to do it right, sort of?
[04:30:46] <acdw> makes it easy to saerch for
[04:30:55] <JibStyle> yep
[04:31:12] <twb> parsnip: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-system_effect
[04:31:45] <acdw> like, admittedly i don't code a ton
[04:31:49] <skangas> Proper packages and namespaces in ELisp would be a dream come through
[04:31:58] <JibStyle> Oof, the second system effect is real
[04:32:00] <acdw> but with modern coding tools, it's not hard to complete symbol names
[04:32:07] <parsnip> dart should have had libraries as "objects"
[04:32:16] <parsnip> but they went with familiarity
[04:32:25] <parsnip> like java, i guess
[04:32:42] <skangas> acdw: To be fair, nameless helps quite a bit
[04:32:48] <acdw> oh?
[04:32:54] <acdw> i've heard of nameless i think?
[04:33:09] <skangas> So it shortens "my-package-foo" into ":foo" visually
[04:33:12] <acdw> oh yeah that's it
[04:33:19] <skangas> The underlying text is the same though
[04:33:21] <acdw> i mean, i just read the names
[04:33:22] <skangas> It's a pretty neat hack
[04:33:48] <acdw> oh but C-c C-- is a good bind
[04:35:42] <parsnip> grym: aha https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/search?q=shorthands
[04:35:50] <JibStyle> Will this shorthands feature break all my `my-foo` definitions in my .emacs file? What about existing published packages?

[04:39:28] <skangas> IIUC, at least
[04:39:54] <parsnip> that makes more sense, i guess
[04:39:56] <skangas> So I might want to use "some-other-long-package-name", so I might name that "x-", and then use x-foo x-bar, etc.
[04:40:28] <parsnip> oh like (require 'cl-lib) (i-hate-cl-do)
[04:40:41] <skangas> Something like that, but with an awkward syntax
[04:41:40] <skangas> You use a local variable that's named, IIRC, read-symbol-shorthands
[04:42:21] <skangas> In other words, this is not a language level construct, but a variable operating on the reader level

[09:19:00] <twrk_> widen the pipes, people shove more crap in them >_>
[09:19:16] <twb> twrk_: so like 1920x1080 typical 19" LCD, is 1920x1080 pixels, which is 2073600 pixels, or 2 megapixels
[09:19:42] <yeti> iirc that one above is 1600x900
[09:19:51] <twb> twrk_: and a good 38mm film is about 8 times better than that
[09:20:12] <yeti> I dont need to see every grain of dust
[09:20:52] <twb> Now the OTHER problem you have is that because every fucking dickhead buys cameras based on the number of pixels
[09:21:11] <twb> yeti: the actual CCD array is optimized for that instead of actual good reception.
[09:21:31] <twb> So you end up with a huuuuuge image that, if you actually look at it at 1:1 size, is full of noise
[09:21:57] <twb> Because light is quantized and the the CCD is operating at such a level that the quantization causes stochastic noise

[14:38:59] <krux02> I am just asking, because I make a toy language compiler, and I wonder if I should support flymake or flycheck
[14:39:10] <JibStyle> For elisp, it mostly does linting, to help you conform to a universal code style
[14:39:21] <krux02> yea I have that with flycheck
[14:39:25] <krux02> but there is also flymake
[14:39:32] <EdwardIII> for me i just want to see if i have errors in my init.el before reloading :) 
[14:39:53] <JibStyle> flymake is built-in, flycheck is from MELPA

[14:40:07] <JibStyle> many say flycheck is better FWIW, but i prefer built-in
[14:40:18] <krux02> JibStyle, I also prefer builtin
[14:40:32] <JibStyle> nice
[14:40:37] <krux02> I am looking forward to replace projectile with built-in project 
[14:41:37] <JibStyle> i've never used projectile, never understood the need for it
[14:41:46] <JibStyle> built-in project is pretty minimal and quick to learn

[14:42:36] <JibStyle> i also tend to write a few basic elisp commands for basic stuff, like going to my main projects
[14:44:12] <krux02> JibStyle, when I learned to use projectile I didn't know about the existence of built-in project
[14:44:20] *** Joins: natrys (~natrys@user/natrys)
[14:44:28] <krux02> and as far as I can see, project is pretty close to what I want.
[14:44:45] <krux02> I like that projectile automatically keeps track of visited projects.
[14:45:04] <krux02> It stores those projects in a file that I also use for another `proj` shell command.
[14:45:29] <JibStyle> i see -- i just use the minibuffer history for keeping track lol
[14:46:22] <JibStyle> EdwardIII: does `flymake-goto-next-error' work?
[14:47:38] <EdwardIII> yep that works
[14:48:52] <EdwardIII> i can open the *Flymake...* window to see the error, and hit enter on a line to take me there, which is not too bad
[14:50:10] <JibStyle> Ok, TBH I haven't used flymake in a while, but I know it works, and with appropriate hacking you can plug in backends for other languages.
[14:50:57] <EdwardIII> in vim there's coc and there seems to be an integration for almost everything
[14:51:07] <EdwardIII> and they all work in a fairly unified way. it's pretty nice
[14:51:51] <JibStyle> krux02: Regarding project, keep in mind that finding regexp in project is synchronous, so only usable with small projects.
[14:52:03] <EdwardIII> maybe flymake is the equivalent here (still learning the ropes)

[17:39:38] <bremner> Bayes: bible + sed

[17:43:22] <grym> hmm, "Figurative sense of "any authoritative book" is from 1804."

[17:46:44] <Bayes> what's wrong with avocation?
[17:46:51] <Bayes> besides people thinking it might be related with avocados
[17:46:52] <grym> it originally meant  "distraction"
[17:47:08] <grym> not "the thing i do"
[17:47:15] <Bayes> ahh
[17:47:18] <grym> which is, naturally, _vocation_
[17:47:42] <tromey> winning-luser: how about the art of the metaobject protocol?  that is really great and also pretty short
[17:47:47] <grym> but the double-sense has been around since about 1650, i think we're stuck with it
