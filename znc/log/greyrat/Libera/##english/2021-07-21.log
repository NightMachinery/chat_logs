[01:08:26] <thojanssens> is it possible to say that an appointment has been "discontinued" ?
[01:09:38] <bin> thojanssens: yes if it was an ongoing appointment at a regular time
[01:09:49] <bin> "My appointments with Mary on Thursdays have been discontinued"
[01:10:21] <thojanssens> bin, it doesn't work when it is a one-time appointment?
[01:10:25] <bin> no
[01:10:28] <bin> just say cancelled
[01:10:31] <thojanssens> bin, thank you!
[01:10:44] <bin> no problem
[01:11:49] <thojanssens> bin, actually i'm looking for an adjective or adverb that can mean both: not taking place because it has been *canceled* or the client/patient was *absent*
[01:12:03] <thojanssens> (i'm a programmer, I'm looking for a boolean variable name)
[01:12:28] <thojanssens> bin, I thought about discontinued for including both canceled or absent
[01:12:34] <bin> well
[01:12:43] <bin> that works in this context i guess
[01:13:39] <thojanssens> bin, I don't have much choice... I have looked though all the synonyms for some of those words, I'm a little obsessed with variable naming in my code, that's why I can be seen lurking here around from time to time for help with variable naming haha
[01:13:46] <thojanssens> trough*
[01:13:50] <thojanssens> through*
[01:14:14] <bin> yeah i mean in conversation i wouldn't say it but as a boolean variable it's fine
[01:14:30] <thojanssens> bin, if "discontinued" is not *shocking* then I'll go for that!
[01:14:43] <bin> yeah i think it's fine
[01:14:45] <thojanssens> bin, ok cool, thanks!
[01:14:49] <thojanssens> <3
[01:14:51] <bin> <3
[01:14:57] <bin> others are free to disagree or give a better one xD
[01:15:02] <bin> but I'm super guilty of overthinking names
[01:15:16] <bin> and i think it works okay here
[01:16:50] <ksft> I think "discontinued" is wrong
[01:17:01] <ksft> how about "did not happen"?
[01:17:09] <bin> ksft: he needs a SINGLE WORD
[01:17:18] <ksft> why does it need to be a single word?
[01:17:24] <bin> because it's a boolean variable
[01:17:30] <bin> and unnecessary verbosity is gross
[01:17:32] <ksft> oh
[01:17:41] <ksft> (sorry, missed that)
[01:17:45] <bin> np
[01:18:24] <ksft> I think I would prefer "canceled" to "discontinued", even if that doesn't make it entirely clear that it includes instances where the patient didn't show up without canceling in advance

[01:28:24] <thojanssens> ksft, yeah but that sounds weird for an appointment in the future :D
[01:28:30] <CuriosTiger> What I like to do in code to avoid auxiliary verb complications is to use true and false
[01:28:35] <CuriosTiger> like happened_true and happened_false
[01:28:36] <thojanssens> ksft, did_not_happen works tho
[01:29:10] <thojanssens> ksft, sorry I read it again, I am wrong
[01:33:17] <TimMc> How about "skipped"?
[01:33:49] <TimMc> oh hmm, that would be more appropriate for appointments in a series
[01:34:16] <CuriosTiger> if he's just looking for one word to indicate the appointment is no longer valid, perhaps "void"?
[01:35:50] <ksft> I like both of those
[01:36:23] <TimMc> "happened" really would be best, if you can negate it.
[01:36:47] <TimMc> It sounds like there are multiple ways for an appointment to not happen, and one way for it to happen...

[10:11:56] <twb> "verbose" isn't the same as "polite"
[10:12:07] <twb> Needless words waste the reader's time.  They are rude.
[10:12:10] <Voxel> I mean, at least I hope it looks like it

[10:13:07] <Voxel> I'd say short messages are rude instead
[10:13:24] <twb> Voxel: because you were too lazy to make it shorter
[10:14:02] <twb> There is a difference between concision and brusqueness.

[10:17:08] <Voxel> That's the point, indeed.

[10:29:05] <Voxel> For example, "I suggest you" sound like an order to me or like something too momentous or egoistic in some circumstances like (Look, I KNOW what YOU have to do. LET me share my damn knowledge). Like a rude boss would say.
[10:29:18] <Voxel> IMHO ^
[10:34:14] <twb> Then why "I suggest you" at all
[10:34:38] <Voxel> Because "I'd suggest you"
[10:34:51] <twb> "Check out ISPs available in your area; pick whichever had good price and customer reviews"
[10:35:22] <Voxel> That may be considered an order.
[10:35:34] <Voxel> Although, some context might help like:
[10:36:03] <Voxel> For example, these steps might help: check out ISPs...; pick...
[10:40:11] <Voxel> Thank you, twb ^^
[10:47:04] <Guest2184> I have witnessed a very interesting and helpful piece of chat. It has reminded me that fortunately, these chat rooms can collect users from all around the world, and that we must keep in mind that that means thay it can collect users from all around the world and that we must try to understand and respect other cultures.
[10:47:05] <Guest2184> Thank you for that.
[10:47:52] <Guest2184> sorry. we must keep in mind that that means that it can collect users with all kind of cultures.

[15:28:45] <pussipupu> you can register multiple nicknames to one account

[15:33:14] <Voxel> Indeed. Only the administration should be able to do that, if possible.
