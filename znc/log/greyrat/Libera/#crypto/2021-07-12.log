[18:11:47] <Haohmaru> uh, i don't remember, but water *is* toxic
[18:12:11] <Haohmaru> i've definately not phrased it that way ^
[18:12:25] <Haohmaru> i don't encourage using google
[18:13:16] <onelegend> was a while back when a fellow member of this channel was trying to use a hashing function for symmetric encryption

[18:13:23] <onelegend> does that ring a bell?
[18:13:55] <Haohmaru> hm
[18:15:13] <Haohmaru> was it about adding <something> to your own posts on something similar to a forum where you don't trust the moderators changing whatever you wrote afterwards without leaving a trace?
[18:15:47] <onelegend> maybe
[18:16:04] <Haohmaru> maybe i asked about such a thing recently ;P~
[18:16:22] <onelegend> all I remember is I'm going to use SHA384 for block encryption, and it's slow but maybe a lot more secure than AEs
[18:16:25] <onelegend> *AES
[18:18:13] <CHG1730> SHA is hashing, AES is encryption. Doesnt serve the same puprose right?
[18:18:56] <Haohmaru> AES is a block cipher
[18:19:20] <onelegend> CHG1730: idk man, that's why I thought it was funny that someone mentioned it
[18:19:27] <Haohmaru> you could make it run like a stream cipher, or turn it into a hash function maybe
[18:19:30] <onelegend> I even remember their username and they are currently in this channel
[18:19:45] <Haohmaru> onelegend what's the first letter of the username?
[18:20:32] <int-e> Hmm, do we have any recent snake oil with ridiculously large keys?
[18:20:40] <int-e> (1 million bit encryption!)
[18:20:41] <CHG1730> Oooh haha, I didnt wanna be rude XD
[18:21:49] <onelegend> Haohmaru: S
[18:21:58] <Haohmaru> then it wasn't me
[18:22:47] <CHG1730> Anyways while were talking about it, does anyone know any orders of speed for the homomorphic encryption from Google?
[18:23:12] <CHG1730> Ive heard it hideously expensive to  compute
[18:23:18] <onelegend> haven't looked at homomoprhic encryption in a while
[18:24:00] <int-e> . o O ( hash -> csrng -> stream cipher )
[18:24:24] <Haohmaru> what's homomorphic even
[18:24:42] <onelegend> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption
[18:24:55] <onelegend> performing calculations on encrypted data without decrypting it first
[18:25:31] <onelegend> pretty fucking cool tbh, would be great for anonymous machine learning
[18:26:31] <Haohmaru> uhm, minimal usage scenario?
[18:26:49] <CHG1730> Ive seen a small presentation where they wanted to use it to allow hospitals to transmit patient data + medicinal data from that patient. Without exposing exaclty what they did
[18:27:31] <CHG1730> So other hospitals could check if certain combinations would be usefull or not. But the other hospital wouldnt have to give out their data for free
[18:27:32] <onelegend> that would be the only good usecase
[18:28:19] * Haohmaru doesn't get it
[18:28:35] <Haohmaru> "normal" can't do it?
[18:28:44] <Haohmaru> * "normal" encryption
[18:29:57] <int-e> Haohmaru: A toy problem is this... I give you two encrypted numbers E(A), E(B). I want you to give me back E(A+B), but without learning anything about A and B in the process.
[18:30:36] <Haohmaru> huh, how does that even work then
[18:30:58] <onelegend> Ring learning with errors
[18:31:32] <onelegend> also most homomorphic encryption only works on asymmetric ciphers
[18:31:47] <onelegend> that's probably why it's so slow
[18:33:32] <int-e> So there needs to be an efficient function p with p(E(A),E(B)) = E(A+B) (addition on plaintexts is performed by p() on ciphertexts). E needs to be specially crafted to be a homomorphism (structure-preserving function) between some structure on ciphertexts and the operations you want to perform on the plaintext.
[18:33:33] <Haohmaru> int-e is it like.. i'm not allowed to ever see the values of A and B, but i wanna sum them, i am given something that allows me to sum them despite the encryption, then i can see the encrypted result, but i still can't guess what A and B were?
[18:34:08] <int-e> Haohmaru: yes.
[18:34:13] <Haohmaru> huh, funky
[18:34:30] <Haohmaru> but then the number of possible "operations" i can do must be pretty limited, right?
[18:34:51] <int-e> Extremely. And it is grossly inefficient at this time.
[18:35:05] <Haohmaru> okay, i think i sorta get the idea
[18:36:06] <Haohmaru> and the whole goal is to allow someone with super-sikrit-fancy algorithms process your sikrit data without seeing it
[18:36:43] <Haohmaru> supposedly.. i'm not sure i'd trust google on that ;P~
[18:36:54] *** Quits: brcolow (~brcolow@ip68-0-136-132.tc.ph.cox.net) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[18:37:12] <CHG1730> True, but the idea is that you encrypt the data before sending it to their servers.
[18:37:28] <CHG1730> Although if they build a backdoor into their library its all game over ofc.
[18:37:31] <Haohmaru> yeah, with their own encryption algo
[18:37:50] <onelegend> it's good for encrypted machine learning
[18:38:08] <onelegend> what what if I want the RESULT to be secret as well?
[18:38:24] <Haohmaru> the result is secret, as far as i understand
[18:38:50] <onelegend> ah so then it sends the encrytpegd result, and you decrypt it
[18:38:54] <onelegend> oh taht works
[18:38:56] <onelegend> noive
[18:39:00] <onelegend> *noice
[18:39:16] <int-e> It's really not made for putting your computations into an untrusted cloud; it's vastly cheaper to run your own server. But it has some weird applications in zero knowledge proofs and possibly "smart" "contracts".
[18:39:48] <int-e> it's also a buzzword, sadly.
[18:39:51] <onelegend> ye
[18:39:55] <onelegend> self hosting is king
[18:40:18] <onelegend> much rather just deploy on premises like many companies do
[18:40:26] <Haohmaru> int-e i see it possibly usable for those who make programs into online-based services (easiest way to copy-protect - never give away the sikrit algorithms)
[18:41:32] <Haohmaru> for things where you wouldn't trust them with the data, so you'd send them encrypted version and they will process it "blindly"
[18:41:42] <Haohmaru> if that makes sense
[18:41:52] <CHG1730> exactly
[18:42:28] <int-e> From a theoretical perspective this stuff is ground-breaking, because for a long time many people believed that code obfuscation was fundamentally impossible and this shows the contrary. (If you can obscure computations on data in arbitrary computations, you can write an interpreter, making the actual program being run part of the obscured data... and noone without the right key will know what...

[18:42:34] <int-e> ...your program is doing)
[18:42:45] <CHG1730> Or if a company has a way to check for certain disease in DNA, you send them the encrypted version of your genome and they calculate the results and give it back to you
[18:42:57] <CHG1730> but that is quite far away as of now ofc.
[18:43:08] <onelegend> also sounds like a great way to implement DRM and vendor lock in
[18:43:20] <ioxzev1z> CHG1730, wouldn't something like that work so that the transfer is encrypted both ways, but the data is not for processing purposes?
[18:43:43] <ioxzev1z> I don't see anyone working on encrypted data
[18:44:02] <Haohmaru> currently i know a bunch of online conversion websites (most of them are free tho), like, for media formats.. images, audio, even CAD files.. maybe also text
[18:45:16] <CHG1730> ioxzev1z: it was a basic example. DNA is maybe a bad example because you know quite some parts of the "plaintext"
[18:45:25] <Haohmaru> an unrealistic example would be, you need to convert your photo from .png to .jpg, but you have nothing that does it, there's a payware website that can convert it but you don't want them to have a copy of your photo.. so you'd encrypt the data
[18:45:58] <Haohmaru> but i think this is either not gonna work, or converting from png to jpg blindly is gonna be sooooooooo slow
[18:46:22] <Haohmaru> cuz it's not some linear process like integer summation
[18:46:49] <onelegend> but can I use it for bitcoin mining?
[18:46:56] <CHG1730> Yeah its slow AF right now but thats the same we said about ML a couple of years ago
[18:47:01] <onelegend> I'd love some cRyPtocuRRency
[18:47:03] <ioxzev1z> CHG1730, I mean in general that you would only encrypt transfer, and disks where data is stored, but you would not try to work on encrypted data. You would sign an NDA and work on the cleartext
[18:48:39] <CHG1730> ioxzev1z: the idea is that FHE allows you to not trust the other party. It's a lot faster to work on cleartext, but you have to trust the other party AND have to trust that that party never accidentaly leaks the data.
[18:49:47] <ioxzev1z> CHG1730, trust is a big part of having other people deal with your data. If you don't trust them then you need to do the processing yourself
[18:49:54] <Haohmaru> surely if you generate a key which you and only _you_ use for the data, that sounds promising
[18:52:42] <CHG1730> ioxzev1z: hmm I dont know about that. Nowadays you dont 'trust' a website to keep your plaintext password secure right?
[18:52:47] <Haohmaru> int-e were you thinking about using this for actual code? to obfuscate the algorithms?
[18:53:01] <int-e> Haohmaru: no
[18:53:14] <MacGyver> CHG1730: We do, in fact, trust them to do that.
[18:53:47] <MacGyver> CHG1730: They see your password. They hopefully don't *store* it that way, but most password authentication is still a matter of sending the literal plaintext password over to the remote for checking.
[18:54:03] <Haohmaru> wtf
[18:54:22] <int-e> Haohmaru: I'm mostly still wondering wtf this is good for. I really only see very few niche applications for it...
[18:54:49] <CHG1730> MacGyver: hmm I want to disagree, but your actually kinda right. Although the plaintext password gets send over HTTPS hopefully. 
[18:54:50] <Haohmaru> MacGyver i thought like.. the webpage would tell your browser "this is a password entry field, use <XYZ> algorithm and give me a a hash
[18:55:04] <MacGyver> Haohmaru: Nope.
[18:55:08] <Haohmaru> >:(
[18:55:11] <int-e> And then there are some very odd announcements like https://www.msspalert.com/cybersecurity-services-and-products/encryption/intel-microsoft-partner/ that make me wonder whether I'm missing something big there.
[18:55:33] <CHG1730> I hope most sites use a salt alongside with the hash
[18:55:37] <MacGyver> int-e: I believe some people think it's a way to offload computing on the secret data to cloud providers.
[18:55:47] <CHG1730> and that salt is usually only stored on the webservers DB
[18:56:02] <MacGyver> CHG1730: I hope most sites use a tested PHF, but that's about *storage* and leaking *to an attacker*.
[18:56:14] <MacGyver> It's not about trusting the site *itself*.
[18:56:21] <int-e> MacGyver: But... yeah, I don't believe in it. And in any case we're far from the point where this is remotely (hah) attractive...

[19:06:20] <onelegend> by hand means with pencil abd paper and a shitty scientific calculator
[19:06:28] <ericonr> CHG1730: but given that a lot of users use common passwords across websites, shouldn't a more correct practice be to avoid broadcasting it around, even if protected by a tunnel?
[19:06:29] <onelegend> so not rlt by hand
[19:06:37] <onelegend> more like wout good cpu
[19:06:42] <onelegend> what am I even saying
[19:06:43] <onelegend> nvm
[19:06:45] <int-e> A single block in 30 minutes... no way
[19:06:51] <onelegend> ill just use one time pad
[19:07:02] <ioxzev1z> ericonr, not much difference between sending p over TLS than H(p) over non-tls
[19:07:07] <CHG1730> ioxzev1z: here a some examples, i didnt have time to run them on my own so i cant stand for the validity. https://github.com/google/fully-homomorphic-encryption/tree/main/transpiler

[19:07:15] <ioxzev1z> actually that needs to be corrected
[19:08:07] *** Joins: kikijiki (~Thunderbi@user/kikijiki)
[19:08:41] <CHG1730> ericonr: the TLS tunnel is a setup for a symmetrical key. So if you send password: "pa$$w0rd" multiple times, its not as if the encrypted stream send the same encrypted bytes everytime
[19:09:04] <TimMc> ericonr: Correct, a password should be a shared secret between you and one service, not you and 30 different services. :-)
[19:09:40] <TimMc> CHG1730: That's not the problem. The problem is one website gets hacked.
[19:09:52] <CHG1730> TimMC: I wish I could convince more people about that, but even at universities I see the same password being used again and again
[19:11:02] <int-e> "even at universities" hehe
[19:12:28] <CHG1730> TimMc: agreed, but moving the hashing phase from the webserver to the client doesnt really solve that issue
[19:13:09] <CHG1730> int-e: wasnt meant as an insult, but more that people that should be the most knowledgeable about that stuff, dont follow their own advice
[19:13:13] <int-e> (IME universities are odd... there's really little secrecy or value attached to most data. If anything they'll be less security conscious than private companies.)
[19:14:23] <ericonr> TimMc: as someone who had to spend a night fixing old accounts because of password reuse, it would seem to me that implementations should try even more to protect users from such dumb mistakes :(
[19:14:46] <ericonr> because it's def a very common one
[19:15:05] <TimMc> Really what you want is a way that users don't have to think about passwords at all, of course...
[19:15:26] <TimMc> except in the few places they really need to know one
[19:15:52] <Haohmaru> "knock knock" "who dis? "iz me!" "k, come on in"
[19:16:00] <int-e> CHG1730: It's just that being intelligent isn't much of a factor... it's about priorities (write the next paper), policies (often none relating to account security), risks (almost no money or value attached to data)...

[19:17:39] <ms7821> minor thing, but hashing on the client side does nothing if you're using TLS, because you can reuse the hashes instead of the passwords

[19:20:53] <ms7821> also, the really interesting bit of FHE will be applying algorithms that are commercially sensitive, e.g. scanning emails for keywords without revealing those keywords but also without having plaintext access to those emails
[19:21:02] <Haohmaru> CHG1730 you have to be aware of password managers first
[19:21:39] <Haohmaru> ms7821 true, like for spam detection.. but that'd be slow
[19:23:18] <TimMc> There are some obscure situations where hashing on the client side would help even under TLS.
[19:23:50] <Haohmaru> also, websites should state their password max length and such things
[19:24:12] <TimMc> You'd have to have a case where the auth frontend and the auth backend are on different servers (I've seen this!) and the attacker has only compromised the backend -- and a salt is in use, too.
[19:24:14] <Haohmaru> or not accept too long passwords
[19:24:16] <onelegend> client side hashing for web logins?
[19:24:19] <onelegend> that sounds really dumb
[19:24:32] <TimMc> So yeah, in the general case it's pretty pointless.
[19:24:37] <onelegend> because then the hash would be your password
[19:24:47] <ericonr> ms7821: but then the server won't know the password :p
[19:25:04] <Haohmaru> they don't *need* to know your password
[19:25:14] <TimMc> onelegend: In my kind of rare example above, the attacker would only learn a hash that would then not be usable on other websites. :-)

[19:26:38] <onelegend> PAKE

[19:26:47] <ms7821> it's really not

[19:27:19] <ms7821> passwords need to die

[19:47:22] <Alipha> onelegend: i still like card chameleon the best because it's the easiest to do, imo (doesn't require math). and despite the supposed weakness i found, it's still not practical to crack messages encrypted with card ciphers. cracking techniques involve having access to A LOT (MBs? GBs?) of ciphertext, or knowing a large portion of the corresponding plaintext, or getting an oracle to encrypt specific plaintext
[19:47:24] <Alipha> strings, none of which would happen in real life with card playing ciphers
[19:48:05] <Alipha> i also made a suggestion which i believe fixes the weakness i found and hopefully doesn't expose any others :-) "His suggestion to improve the security of the cipher would be to swap the red card above the plaintext black card with the top red card, rather than swapping the second red card."
[19:48:47] <onelegend> ah so it's quite secure for short msgs
[19:48:59] <Alipha> onelegend: right

[19:52:19] <TimMc> Throw some junk into the plaintext? Use synonyms?

[19:53:03] <onelegend> actually
[19:53:20] <onelegend> people who meetup in real life should exchange a couple hundred pads
[19:53:46] <onelegend> you'd first encrypt the message with the vernam cipher and then send the message through an end to end encrypted channel like the signal protocol

[23:21:16] <dostoyevsky2> So if I want to use a sat solver with a cipher, I just have to transcribe it into CNF and then the sat solver can do it's thing,,,
[23:21:25] <dostoyevsky2> If I understood correctly
[23:22:24] <dostoyevsky2> which can be a bit tricky as CNF does not have XOR, which is often used in ciphers, but I saw there are some sat solvers that have xor too
[23:23:32] <riv> you can use a higher level library that translates into CNF for you
[23:25:18] <dostoyevsky2> riv: you mean there are libraries like: AST to CNF?
[23:26:18] <ms7821> there are some examples in https://www.cs.uaf.edu/2017/fall/cs493/lecture/09_26_cbmc_decrypt.html

[23:59:12] <dostoyevsky2> ms7821: oh, they are using cbmc which doesn't actually need CNF but can use C directly...
