[13:49:27] <yogg> Hi
[13:51:16] <yogg> I try to build openvpn 2.6 with dco (dco branch) on debian 11. I run the "autoreconf -vi" command and then the "./configure --enable-dco" which fails with "configure: error: libnl-genl-3.0 package not found or too old. Is the development package and pkg-config installed? Must be version 3.4.0 or newer"
[13:51:34] <yogg> But the lib is installed:
[13:51:35] <yogg> # dpkg -l | grep "libnl-genl"
[13:51:35] <yogg> iiÂ  libnl-genl-3-200:amd64Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  3.4.0-1+b1Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  amd64Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  library for dealing with netlink sockets - generic netlink
[13:51:36] <yogg> iiÂ  libnl-genl-3-dev:amd64Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  3.4.0-1+b1Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  amd64Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  development library and headers for libnl-genl-3
[13:53:00] <yogg> I'm really sure the problem comes from "configure.ac" line 780 -> ... [libnl-genl-3.0 >= 3.2.29] ...
[13:55:13] <plaisthos> yogg: see readme
[13:55:24] <plaisthos> do you have pkg_config really installed?
[13:56:27] <plaisthos> the error message also says that you need pkg-config
[13:57:56] *** Joins: DmanT (~DmanT@2001:41d0:a:f55c::1)
[13:58:27] <yogg> ok, "apt install pkg-config"Â  solved the problem. thx. From where in this error message do I see that "pkg-config" was missing?
[13:59:11] <plaisthos> yogg: the message you pasted said that:

[17:58:31] <yogg> ordex I just tested openvpn 2.6 with dco. Sadly my setup does not work anymore if dco is enabled. With "disable-dco" in the same config everything works again. If dco is enabled I can only ping the client itself, but not the net clients net.
[17:58:31] <yogg> If I send a package to the clients net, I see (with tcpdump) the package gos out on the tun interface but not comes in on the clients tun interface (same behaviour as if the iroute is missing in non dco mode)
[18:05:13] <BtbN> https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn/blob/dco/README.dco.md#routing-with-ovpn-dco
[18:05:27] <ordex> yogg: did you invert "in" and "out"?
[18:05:44] <ordex> yogg: have you configured iroutes in the related ccd files?
[18:07:39] <ordex> hm there might be a bug there
[18:07:52] <ordex> yogg: can you se verb 4 and show us the server log after a client connects?
[18:08:37] <ordex> BtbN: that doc might need some love - it is a bit unclear at the moment
[18:09:02] <ordex> at least it sounds so while re-reading it now :)
[18:09:17] <ordex> yogg: and thanks for testing
[18:19:25] <yogg> ordex the log: https://pastebin.com/HgibCQR9
[18:20:11] <yogg> I do not use ccd File. I have an external script here which creates the route and an pushfile for the client
[18:20:31] <yogg> The part in the "#########"
[18:20:43] <ordex> yogg: ah ok, so the iroute is dinamically generated?
[18:20:53] <ordex> yogg: you're not using topology subnet, are you?
[18:21:29] <yogg> in the config I set "topology subnet"
[18:21:38] <ordex> ok
[18:21:49] <ordex> can you show the output of "ip r" after the client has connected, please?
[18:22:03] <ordex> the route seems to be installed properly, so the packet should be sent accordingly
[18:22:30] <ordex> yogg: you said that on the client side you don't see packets to 10.216.21.0/24 popping out, right?
[18:23:42] <yogg> the routes: https://pastebin.com/nzryADC4
[18:25:05] <ordex> yogg: is this the routing table on the server?
[18:25:17] <yogg> on server side if I ping "10.216.21.1" (the client itself) everything works. If I ping "10.216.21.11" (box behind the client), I see the package gous out on tun0 butÂ  do not come in on client side
[18:25:28] <yogg> no the routing table on the client
[18:25:32] <ordex> yogg: ok
[18:25:41] <yogg> ah sorry you want the server one sec
[18:25:50] <ordex> yogg: are you saying that on the *client* the packet to .11 comes out of tun0 ?
[18:26:58] <yogg> https://pastebin.com/N1q47wtv
[18:27:29] <yogg> no on client side I can't see the package
[18:27:50] <ordex> ok
[18:27:58] <ordex> thanks for the clarification
[18:28:45] <yogg> at leatst not on the tun interface (I just check if any openvpn package comes in on the "hardware interface")
[18:29:15] <ordex> hm ok, so the client IP is not in the subnet configured on the server ... I am thinking if this is triggering some corner case
[18:29:34] <ordex> yogg: would you mind recompiling ovpn-dco on the server with "make DEBUG=1"
[18:29:45] <ordex> as it will print some more details about the things it is doing
[18:29:57] <ordex> and we might see an indication of what might be wrong
[18:30:20] <ordex> the routing table looks correct
[18:32:51] <yogg> Ok, I also see no encrypted package on the client if I listen on the main NIC. I recompile openvpn, takes a little
[18:33:39] <ordex> yogg: just ovpn-dco
[18:33:42] <ordex> not openvpn itself
[18:34:01] <yogg> ok
[18:34:01] <ordex> yogg: and yes, the problem is likely that the server is not agreeing on sending those packets to the peer, for some reason
[18:40:48] <rob0> "ip route get 10.216.21.11" (but I guess that's already showing the correct nexthop?)
[18:42:50] <yogg> the log with DEBUG=1: https://pastebin.com/7iNA1dSE
[18:42:51] <yogg> I don't see something different, is this maybe thew rong logfile?
[18:43:06] <yogg> ~# ip route get 10.216.21.11
[18:43:06] <yogg> 10.216.21.11 dev tun0 src 10.216.255.2 uid 0
[18:43:07] <yogg> Â Â Â  cache
[18:43:27] <yogg> yea the route looks ok for me
[18:44:48] <ordex> yogg: for the extra messages, please check "dmesg"
[18:45:03] <ordex> ovpn-dco is a kernel module and will print to the the kernel logfile, viewable with dmesg
[18:45:36] <ordex> yogg: oh
[18:45:40] <ordex> can you remove this route: 10.216.21.0/24 dev tun0 scope link src 10.216.255.2  ?
[18:46:00] <ordex> I think it is taking precedence over the other one: 10.216.21.0/24 via 10.216.21.1 dev tun0 metric 100 
[18:46:08] <ordex> and thus ovpn-dco does not know which nexthop to use
[18:46:41] <ordex> (I think this is exactly what your "ip r get" command is showing)
[18:47:25] <yogg> ok that solves it, but I think I had an problem before -> I just test it again
[18:48:11] <ordex> ok
[18:50:13] <yogg> yea if I don't create this route first (10.216.21.0/24 dev tun0 scope link src 10.216.255.2), then openvpn can't create the second route (10.216.21.0/24 via 10.216.21.1 dev tun0 metric 100)
[18:51:08] <yogg> If I try it manual:
[18:51:09] <yogg> # ip ro add 10.216.21.0/24 via 10.216.21.1 dev tun0 metric 100
[18:51:09] <yogg> Error: Nexthop has invalid gateway.
[18:51:32] <yogg> because the system has no way to the "10.216.21.0/24" net
[18:51:59] <rob0> you can't have a gateway inside the network you're routing to
[18:52:17] <rob0> you have to have a route to the gateway
[18:52:33] <rob0> I wonder how this would have been working without DCO?
[18:53:28] <yogg> Without DCO with this route "10.216.21.0/24 dev tun0 scope link src 10.216.255.2" and the iroute in openvpn everything works fine
[18:54:40] <yogg> I know what you mean, but the strange thing is now that if I delete the route after evertyhing is set up it works ^^
[18:55:07] <yogg> but wait I can do something diferent now
[18:59:04] <ordex> yogg: you're right. how about adding just a host route? ip route add 10.216.21.1/32 dev tun0 ?
[18:59:18] <ordex> yogg: it may work due to some routing caching
[18:59:44] <yogg> I don't create a route to the entire network, I just create a route to the client (/32). And the route the rest of the network over the client: https://pastebin.com/yKu4YjKw
[18:59:47] <ordex> when the route was added, the forwarding interface was selected. so deleting now has little effect, even though creates a weird state
[19:00:09] <ordex> yogg: yup! exactly my suggestion above :)
[19:00:13] <yogg> yea same idea ^^, works fine now
[19:00:16] <ordex> it should work this way, does it?
[19:00:19] <ordex> yeah
[19:00:50] <ordex> the double route confused DCO as to which peer to pick as next hop. but yeah, you are using IPs outside of the VPN network, so at least a route to tell where the netxhop can be found is required
[19:01:24] <ordex> yogg: btw normally you assign peers an IP in the same VPN subnet. even when they have one orm ore networks behind
[19:01:33] <ordex> but I don't know all your details, so you may have reasons for doing that
[19:02:48] <yogg> yea I have several clients on the same server and every clients has its own /24 net
[19:03:35] <ordex> that's ok, but still each client could get its own IP inside the VPN network
[19:03:56] <ordex> normally you do that over tunnels (ip on both ends in the same subnet)
[19:04:06] <ordex> it does not affect what you route over (the client specific LAN)
[19:04:52] <ordex> that would avoid adding the /32 route for each client
[19:10:25] <ordex> yogg: and after finishing with this, I am curious to learn if your "HA" trick works or not with DCO :)

[19:12:52] <yogg> ahh yea now I understand what you mean, I could also create a small transport net (/30) and the create routes there, but we wan't to avoid that so we have the client in the same net and have then NAT rules on the client
[19:12:52] <yogg> Yea now this works, the next test will be the HA setup
[19:23:27] <rob0> "NAT rules on the client" does not follow.
[19:23:43] <rob0> I mean, how is that connected?
[19:24:28] <ordex> yogg: no NAT required
[19:24:31] <ordex> it's just pure routing
[19:24:53] <ordex> imagine each client had several networks behind them, would you have to add an IP for each network to the tun interface? no
[19:25:08] <ordex> you can just route a network over a tunnel not configured for that network
[19:29:24] <yogg> yea but only if behind box01 is not the same network as on box02. If both box01 and box02 have the same network behind them (for example 192.168.1.0/24) then this will not work. This is wy we use NAT.
[19:29:25] <yogg> The first test on the HA setup looks now good :)
[19:29:59] <yogg> I have to fixup the script a little bit more but the linux kernel routing with metric seems to work fine now
[19:30:07] <rob0> well, using the most common RFC 1918 subnet in a VPN is its own punishment
[19:30:32] <yogg> I can't controll all the customers ^^
[19:30:47] <rob0> you can control your networks
[19:33:00] <yogg> the network behind box01 and box02 is not my network. Its the LAN of the customer
[19:33:18] <rob0> but you decided to connect to their LAN
[19:34:04] <rob0> What do you do when a customer connects from a 192.168.1.1 hotspot, and that network is already routed?
[19:35:39] <rob0> All that said, OpenVPN Cloud (the commercial hosted SAAS VPN) has kludges to link multiple identical LANs.
[19:36:45] <yogg> Ahh, ok wrong direction. There is a box in the customers net. The box is an entry point into his net. The customer does not connect to somewhere over the box. The customer connects to another server and then comes over the box to his own LAN.
[19:39:39] <yogg> ordex rob0 Thanks for all the help (and the nice dco module)
[19:40:47] <ordex> yogg: sorry - I was distracted and did not manage to follow your reasoning about NAT vs routing
[19:40:54] <ordex> glad DCO could help - please feel free to report bugs! :)
[19:41:48] <ordex> yogg: quickly: why having the same network behind two clients won't work? you'll have two routes, but only one will be picked, no?
[20:00:51] <yogg> the non dco version will not work because one client overwrites the iroute of the other client (openvpn seems to do not associate the iroute to the client -> I think this is so from testing not from reading the code)

[20:17:26] <ordex> yogg: right, but we have dco now :)
[20:17:36] <ordex> so my question was about the dco case
[20:22:09] <yogg> ordex Ok I don't understand. My "HA" setup seems to works now. I have 2 Boxes in the same /24 network and create routes with different metrics to them. If the mainbox dies, the packages run to the failover box (at least in my first low level test -> I have to do much more testing)
