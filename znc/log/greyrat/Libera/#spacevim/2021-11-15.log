[01:41:04] <SpaceVimBot> <anpok> hm I meant Werror is not necessary
[01:41:38] <SpaceVimBot> <anpok> and ok - Wevertything - didnt know that exists - but apparantly it does - I was just looking for reasons why the clang could prematurely abort parsing
[02:04:12] <SpaceVimBot> <anpok> hm another thing to consider is the current working directory - it might be were spacevim things the project is ..
[02:04:21] <SpaceVimBot> <anpok> so maybe you have adapt the include paths?
[02:25:16] <SpaceVimBot> <anpok> in the end you have .clang file pointing to a compile_flags.txt

[12:16:24] <SpaceVimBot> <crocodile2u_twitter> I just installed SV, but my UI is not all that beautiful as in the screenshots. No nice arrow-like tabs, numbers in circles or any other icons.. I have installed the SauceCode fonts, and I am using SpaceVim in a terminal, I'm on Ubuntu and my shell is a zsh.

[13:05:59] <SpaceVimBot> <crocodile2u_twitter> Apparently, I can't get the proper font to work.. I downloaded SourceCodePro, according to docs, unpacked it to ~/.fonts . I selected Source Code Pro font for my terminal, it seems to work nicely in the terminal itself, but when I start vim / neovim-qt, I get no icons and other font goodies
