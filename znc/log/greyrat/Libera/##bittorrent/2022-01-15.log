[01:48:39] <crashrep> Hey, on my website i want to have a link that users can click to download a video from peertube via torrent. Should I advertise the direct link to the .torrect file, or the mganet URI?
[02:02:52] <DeHackEd> direct link is ideal, but the difference is pretty minor
[02:24:31] <crashrep> thanks DeHackEd, I just did some more research and i think the difference is the magnet URI has all the information to tell the client other torrents to download from (or downloading from the server), while a .torrent file has the client always contact the server and the server replies back if the client can leech from other users, do you think that is accurate?
[02:30:03] <The_8472> a torrent file generally contains more useful information for a client. a magnet link is an additional level of indirection where the client first has to find a swarm and then download parts of the torrent before it can download the actual content
[02:30:17] <The_8472> additionally it depends on whether the magnet link contains tracker URLs or not
[02:30:52] <The_8472> if you have a place to host something then a .torrent is preferred. magnets are mostly for text-only formats like chat or something.
[02:32:24] * crashrep has a ton more to learn
[02:32:57] <crashrep> i'll probably stick with .torrent because i don't want to bombarde the peertube instance with api calls to get the updated magnet iru
[02:33:01] <crashrep> s/iru/uri
[02:33:08] <crashrep> thanks The_8472
[02:34:12] <The_8472> well, a client will generally hit the the tracker server afterwards either way (tracker URLs can be embedded in magnets or torrents) and that's normal operation for bittorrent
