[13:57:10] <mort> hey
[13:57:58] <mort> does anyone know the reasoning behind the design decision to allow the wrong types in columns?
[13:58:49] <mort> we just found out that we had a typo in our application where someone had accidentally put some quotes in an SQL statement, and as a result we had a bool column with a mix of bools and strings, and I just can't for the life of me figure out why we would want that
[14:00:56] <mort> my understanding is that the entire point of a schema is to let the storage system validate the data we put into it; the main advantage of an RDBMS over a JSON store is that you do have a set schema and you get some verification that the data you're putting into it is in the right shape
[14:01:33] <mort> so I would very much like to understand the reasoning behind making a storage system with a fixed schema where everything has set types, but where the wrong types are accepted without even a warning
[14:15:21] <colo> mort, I do not know, but you should be aware of https://www.sqlite.org/stricttables.html

[17:07:19] <Profpatsch> mort colo the reasoning is described in https://sqlite.org/datatype3.html
[17:07:47] <Profpatsch> Or rather in https://sqlite.org/flextypegood.html
[17:08:47] <Profpatsch> mort: sqlite is not designed to keep all your invariants inside the database, rather your code should know what is in columns.
[17:09:12] <Profpatsch> > the main advantage of an RDBMS over a JSON store is that you do have a set schema
[17:09:44] <Profpatsch> Not necessarily true, a big part of the value also comes from indexing and taking over locking issues (especially when there’s multiple readers and writers)
[17:10:38] <Profpatsch> A type system can only get you so far, and some invariants you will never be able to express in any database, sqlite just takes a different cutoff point than say postgresql
[17:10:55] <Profpatsch> But the requirements are also completely different, so it’s hard to compare the two

[22:11:00] <mort> Profpatsch: I can't really see a rationale in the document you linked, just a description of how it works?
[22:12:45] <mort> it says that dynamic typing is more flexible than static typing, and that's true, but you get all that flexibility and none of the foot-guns by having some ANY type which can accept any data and verifying the types of non-'ANY' columns so that doesn't explain the current design in any way
[22:15:42] <mort> I suppose maybe there's some argument that if the design of sqlite is fundamentally dynamically typed, adding type checks automatically everywhere would have some performance cost
[22:17:06] <mort> anyways, TIL about strict tables, that's useful
