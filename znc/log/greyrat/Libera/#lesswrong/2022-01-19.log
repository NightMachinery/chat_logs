[03:33:01] <spxtr> in principle, all of what you said are the same: they're silicon fets. it's more expensive to make smaller fets, and failure rates are higher, so the transistors you find in your toothbrush are waaay bigger than those in a cpu

In the wake of the terror attacks of September 11, 2001, B-2 stealth bombers of the 509th Bomb Wing flying from their home base of Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri, flew ultra-long-range strikes at the beginning of Operation Enduring Freedom. Six strikes occurred in all
[06:13:42] <feepbot> from October 7-9. The record Spirit mission was the third of these, conducted on the second night of the campaign, and involved the B-2 nicknamed Spirit of America flown by Major Melvin G. Deaile and Captain Brian Neal. Powered by ‚Äògo pills‚Äô to keep them alert, the two pilots took turns at the controls and sleeping before they entered Afghan airspace and dropped 12 Joint Direct
[06:13:42] <feepbot> Attack Munitions (JDAMs) on their targets. The B-2 was then scheduled to land at Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean before the crew got the call to return to Afghanistan, where they dropped another four JDAMs. The bomber finally touched down at Diego Garcia after being airborne for 44 hours 22 minutes. In some ways, the entire mission for Spirit of America was significantly longer,
[06:13:47] <feepbot> since after touching down at Diego Garcia it remained on the tarmac, engines running, while it was refueled and serviced.

[10:44:54] <Yehoshua> Yes, good things are good. And we all (hopefully) prefer good things.
[10:45:17] <enterprisey> <adiabatic> The Rust version, of course, would be as magnificent as the C++ version. <-- akyshually some batshit design for constexpr rust style got posted and people are shitting on it for once, instead of saying yeah this is good
[10:45:23] <feep[work]> so .. doesn't that answer the question
[10:45:26] <enterprisey> top r/rust comment is someone saying "c++ does it simpler, do it that way"
[10:45:43] <Yehoshua> But your claim was that people get something wrong,
[10:45:43] <Yehoshua> Which only works if it is good.
[10:45:56] <feep[work]> I assume other people also like good things.
[10:46:28] <Obormot\Gaia> Some people like bad things
[10:46:30] <feep[work]> memes do only work if they're good. stylistic suck does not exist. you can make something intentionally bad, but then it will be good in eliciting humor via contrast.
[10:46:33] <feep[work]> bad things are just bad.
[10:46:36] <Yehoshua> feep[work]: Also true.
[10:46:36] <Yehoshua> But that does not mean that everything *is* good.
[10:46:36] <Yehoshua> Specifically - that meme.
[10:46:41] <feep[work]> no, some people like things that other people *tell them* are bad.
[10:46:45] *** Quits: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[10:46:48] <feep[work]> nobody actually likes bad things.
[10:47:22] <feep[work]> that's just a way of saying "this thing is good in an unusual, not socially recognized way"
[10:47:22] <Obormot\Gaia> Not true
[10:47:28] <Obormot\Gaia> Nope
[10:47:41] <Obormot\Gaia> Sometimes some people tell other people that some things are bad
[10:47:41] <Yehoshua> feep[work]: Do you claim "goodness" of humor is universal?
[10:47:43] <feep[work]> Obormot\Gaia: um, I know you're a good/bad absolutist, but that's not the framing I'm arguing in rn
[10:47:44] *** Quits: MerchantOfVenice (~patrick@user/merchantofvenice) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[10:47:45] <Obormot\Gaia> And those first people are right
[10:47:51] <Obormot\Gaia> And those things are in fact bad
[10:48:10] <feep[work]> Yehoshua: no but I claim goodness is *almost* universally identical to preference
[10:48:15] <enterprisey> if I ever need to feel like I'm immediately lost in a conversation, I have an emergency bottle of concentrated #lesswrong
[10:48:15] <Obormot\Gaia> But the second people like them anyway
[10:48:29] <Obormot\Gaia> Because they are dumb, and wrong
[10:48:44] <feep[work]> Yehoshua: if somebody likes a meme, it's generally a good meme
[10:48:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's false!
[10:48:59] <feep[work]> I'm saying that if people got the meme right, others would like them more than the alternative.
[10:49:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> Lots of people like bad memes.
[10:49:06] <feep[work]> see, I disagree with that.
[10:49:25] <quanticle> feep[work]: Of course you like T t, you're all about that tee-tee
[10:49:26] * feep[work] thinks
[10:49:32] <feep[work]> quanticle: I already made that joke :P
[10:49:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't get it
[10:49:40] <Yehoshua> feep[work]: So if anyone thinks a meme is funny, so should practically everone else?
[10:49:42] <enterprisey> memes, being usually a low form of expression, can only be good or bad in a certain audience
[10:50:03] <feep[work]> Yehoshua: I don't think it's universal, I think goodness of a meme is exhibited in making somebody think it's funny.
[10:50:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> enterprisey: That's true about "good" but not about "bad"
[10:50:27] <enterprisey> should meme-bad be the negation of meme-good?
[10:50:32] <feep[work]> Yehoshua: what I'm claiming is that if people got the meme right, it would elicit more amusement.
[10:50:34] <quanticle> feep[work]: Oh, okay. Just making sure
[10:50:36] <quanticle> Obormot\Arcturus: Be glad you're not degenerate enough to get it.
[10:50:38] <Yehoshua> feep[work]: But, that only means _some_ think it's funny.
[10:50:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: Fair enough
[10:50:54] <feep[work]> Yehoshua: yes. I'm saying those people would think the meme, done properly, was *even more* funny.
[10:51:05] <feep[work]> I do think this is somewhat absolute.
[10:51:12] <feep[work]> or rather, generalizable.
[10:51:18] <Yehoshua> feep[work]: But what is "get the meme right" is context dependent.
[10:51:18] <Yehoshua> So different for many different groups.
[10:51:27] <feep[work]> I mean, then I would be wrong
[10:51:30] <feep[work]> but obv I don't think that :p
[10:52:00] <feep[work]> while the contents of memes are context dependent, the operation generally isn't
[10:52:09] <quanticle> Yeah, I don't understand the reasoning behind, "If anyone likes this meme, it's funny." After all, have you seen Facebook? Have you seen boomers sharing top-text/bottom-text memes? Have you seen *Minions* memes?
[10:52:22] <feep[work]> top text/bottom text are funny
[10:52:34] <Yehoshua> Do you agree that _some_ memes (or jokes) can be more or less funny per context?
[10:52:37] <feep[work]> the funniest thing I've ever seen is a clown meme with the words "WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY / BOTTOM TEXT"
[10:52:40] <feep[work]> cracked me up for actual days
[10:53:23] <feep[work]> I still crack a smile on remembering it
[10:53:37] <quanticle> ITT feep[work] openly admits to being a boomer.
[10:53:37] <feep[work]> also quanticle I've *made* minions memes.
[10:53:39] <quanticle> It's okay, feep[work], we understand. You were born this way. You didn't choose to be old, decrepit, and out of touch with the "youths of today"
[10:53:55] <Yehoshua> quanticle: I haven't (and don't plan to),
[10:53:55] <Yehoshua> But "minions" is by definition context dependant.
[10:54:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep[work]: You see? Those are bad memes
[10:54:09] <feep[work]> XD
[10:54:24] <feep[work]> Yehoshua: I don't think they can be more or less *operationally funny* per context
[10:54:49] <feep[work]> I think they can be more or less contextualized, and hence carry different content, but I don't think that memes *work differently* per context, because I don't think that *humor* works differently per context.
[10:55:08] <Yehoshua> feep[work]: Hmm. Your talking about the execution, and not the content?
[10:55:12] <feep[work]> yeah
[10:55:18] <feep[work]> I mean like
[10:55:23] <feep[work]> monty python were shitposters, right
[10:55:25] *** Quits: Fusxfaranto (~Fusxfaran@c-67-188-46-246.hsd1.ca.comcast.net) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[10:55:51] <feep[work]> medium changes, and topic changes, but I don't think the operation changes fundamentally.
[10:56:07] <feep[work]> country matters etc
[10:57:06] <feep[work]> anyway, you can deliberately get a meme wrong to elicit humor, but I don't think that's what's happening with the shitty stop doing memes I've seen
[10:57:17] <feep[work]> I think people just don't get why the original was funny, and so reproduce it badly.
[10:57:33] <Yehoshua> So your saying that a "well delivered joke" vs a "not well delivered joke" is universal?
[10:57:33] <Yehoshua> In that case, I have never really thought about it.
[10:57:49] <feep[work]> yes, I think the delivery is universal, even if the comprehension isn't
[10:58:04] <Yehoshua> feep[work]: Well, that is part of the slight "cult"-ness.
[10:58:13] <feep[work]> sure, that can be enjoyable.
[10:58:22] <feep[work]> and enjoyableness can compensate for lack of amusement
[10:58:38] <feep[work]> you're repeating a shared literal
[10:58:40] <feep[work]> er
[10:58:41] <feep[work]> ritual*
[10:59:08] <feep[work]> but like, the thing about memes is that the propagation of the ritual is based on amusement in the first place
[11:00:05] <feep[work]> so your ritual instantiation will propagate poorly relative to the progenitor
[11:00:39] <Yehoshua> At the start, and along most of the life of each meme, that is true.
[11:00:39] <Yehoshua> I've met some, that cause me to think that some continue in some other fashion.
[11:00:47] <feep[work]> (this is why I hold such love for "WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY / BOTTOM TEXT", it's a metameme that makes fun of bad memes)
[11:01:22] <feep[work]> and of course it has itself been thoughtlessly replicated, which is just the icing
[11:03:02] <Yehoshua> But I concede the point.
[11:03:03] <Yehoshua> Doing something better is better then doing something worse,
[11:03:03] <Yehoshua> And a copy of a joke is closer to the original if it uses the same "flavor" and not just the same structure.
[11:03:03] <Yehoshua> (which might or might not make the copy "better")
[11:03:34] <feep[work]> I mean, as said, you can make ... like, metajokes, jokes that build on doing another joke badly
[11:03:37] <feep[work]> like antihumor
[11:04:01] <feep[work]> "A horse walks into a bar. The bartender asks, why the long face? The horse whinnies and stamps its hoof. Horses cannot talk."
[11:04:49] <feep[work]> that sort of thing, where you're deliberately getting a well-known joke wrong (this one is actually second-generation, I think) to subvert the expectation of the listener of getting a known punchline
[11:04:57] <feep[work]> again, like / BOTTOM TEXT.
[11:05:22] <feep[work]> (the first generation version is "I have terminal cancer, the horse says.")
[11:06:02] <feep[work]> but then the operation of the new joke is different than the one of the original joke, you're building a new joke *on top* of the established one.
[11:06:06] <nshepperd2> it just seems kind of lame to take the "stop doing X" meme, miss the point of the irony, and use it as a vehicle for base outgroup mockery instead
[11:06:12] <feep[work]> yeaH
[11:06:38] <Yehoshua> feep[work]: True.
[11:06:38] <Yehoshua> But you can make a similar joke, which is not meta, but just *is* better.
[11:06:44] <feep[work]> yes.
[11:08:13] <Yehoshua> And the question of making fun of a language,
[11:08:13] <Yehoshua> Or making hidden fun of all those who don't know the language,
[11:08:13] <Yehoshua> Judging which is better is already perhaps not universal.
[11:08:31] <Yehoshua> Its to similar jokes, but not quite the same.
[11:09:03] <Yehoshua> so what the original one was, does not really matter.
[11:09:38] <Yehoshua> s/to/two/
[11:09:38] <feep[work]> I mean sure, if you don't get the irony, then they will seem equally funny.
[11:09:57] <feep[work]> but I think that's more of an issue of having a lack of appreciation for humor, like ... a low humor cap
[11:10:20] <feep[work]> at which point, :throws up hands: I guesssss
[11:10:34] <Yehoshua> feep[work]: I'm not the judge. I actually agree with you which is better.
[11:10:34] <Yehoshua> I just don't think that it must be so.
[11:10:42] <feep[work]> but I suspect what's actually happening is that they do get the joke, they just don't *understand* it
[11:11:03] <Yehoshua> feep[work]: Ahh, but there are plenty of people like that.
[11:11:05] <feep[work]> ie. they don't get why it's funny, so they reproduce it in a way that even to them is less funny, but they don't understand why that is.
[11:11:30] <feep[work]> and that's why it's important to have standards for humor~
[11:11:55] <Yehoshua> Add an rfc
[11:12:05] <feep[work]> RFC-42069
[11:12:32] <Yehoshua> Jokes MUST NOT do such and such, the listener MAY do..
[11:13:32] <feep[work]> like HTTP 451 I'm A Teapot
[11:13:33] <ardent[m]> <feep[work]> "(this is why I hold such love..." <- BOOTY CALL OR / BOTTOM TEXT
[11:13:41] <feep[work]> ardent[m]: ..... gdi.
[11:14:05] <Yehoshua> feep[work]: Well, thats rather.. specific. (I like 2549 too)
[11:14:13] <feep[work]> anyway afk actual work

[20:10:12] <gwern> given the answer about rotation, a falling cat in a vaccuum could rotate itself. however, a floating cat in air in zero-g can't, and we know this from hilariously cruel vomit-comet experiments

[20:11:42] <gwern> you've never seen those videos? you should look it up
[20:11:49] <feep> surely it follows that a floating cat in zero g in vacuum can't right itself

[20:12:12] <rmmh> why wouldn't a cat be able to right itself? 
[20:12:30] <rmmh> they right themselves when falling, which is a zero gravity reference frame

[21:53:09] <PapuaHardyNet> perhaps they do it because it is harder to make microdoses like 0.3mg than it is to make 20mg

[23:14:23] <rmmh> I suppose physically hiding from the revenuers worked during prohibition 
[23:15:57] <ggreer> if your income is less than a certain threshold, you don't have to file taxes. (doesn't matter how much wealth you have, just what your income is)
[23:16:21] <ggreer> though "income" to the IRS can mean many things, such as gifts, selling stock, revenue from illegal activities, etc
[23:19:49] <ggreer> is there a list of which government things are linked to CPI and which aren't? eg: the $10,000 reporting threshold for banks isn't, but federal pensions are sorta linked to CPI (usually CPI minus 1%). tax brackets are adjusted for inflation
[23:20:49] <gwern> "we get 50 good fonts per century, unfortunately, we can't choose which century"
[23:21:09] <ggreer> so as inflation goes to infinity, every monetary transaction must be reported to the government (even buying a pack of gum), pensions become worthless, and taxes are mostly unchanged
[23:21:13] <gwern> ggreer: what's with the gunk on the front?
[23:22:17] <ggreer> that's specular reflection

[23:32:02] <zebrask> Has anyone had actual success "onboarding" non-rationalists to rationality with the sequences or something like it? I keep trying to talk about things to my wife and various other people who didn't naturally gravitate towards rationalist discourse 10 years ago and absorb the full suite of relevant memes and it's like I'm speaking a different language.
[23:32:42] <zebrask> "Here, read this enormous collection of information-dense blog posts" doesn't seem to be working as a strategy üòõ
[23:35:06] <rmmh> many people would rather be happy than knowledgeable 
[23:35:11] <galambo> zebrask, the scout mindset is a good starting point imo
[23:35:22] <galambo> the problem is most people dont read
[23:35:37] <Robomot> [Overcoming Bias] Exploring Value Space - https://www.overcomingbias.com/2022/01/exploring-value-space.html
[23:36:10] <zebrask> Yeah, I was thinking of getting the audiobook for that anyway, so I may see if that's a good jumping-off point.
[23:36:49] <galambo> zabrI read the scout mindset and I do think its a good starting point
[23:37:16] <galambo> it reads like a pop sci book but sneakily delivers most of the rationalist principles
[23:38:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> galambo: Did you read Freddie deBoer's review
[23:38:36] <zebrask> I suspect it may be a fruitless task in the long run, though, unless the person is prone to be interested in this sort of thing.
[23:38:46] <ggreer> zebrask: julia galef's book is the best intro
[23:38:52] <galambo> Obormot\Arcturus, no
[23:38:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> galambo: You should
[23:39:03] <galambo> why
[23:39:11] <ggreer> there's an audiobook version. handy for a road trip or whatever
[23:39:21] <galambo> ok I will read the review
[23:39:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> thx
[23:39:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> I'd like to hear your opinion
[23:39:39] <Robomot> [Less Wrong [frontpage]] Omicron Post #15 by Zvi - https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/tqxfCa6r2yggquenD/omicron-post-15
[23:40:30] <zebrask> Rationality probably doesn't have nearly as much instrumental value for most people as any number of other skills one could acquire with the same time.
[23:42:23] <zebrask> Same way I have failed to get my wife to read more than 1 or 2 of my favorite sci-fi books (and even then it took like a year or so, so I wasn't able to have the kinds of "book club" conversations I was hoping to have in real time).
[23:42:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> zebrask: That's because, to the extent that a person is able to acquire other skills and get benefit from them, they are already behaving sufficiently rationally
[23:42:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> Some people are already more rational than others, you know
[23:42:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> Without ever reading any Sequences
[23:43:26] <rmmh> someone just needs to write a self help book for women that's secretly rationalist 
[23:43:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> On the other hand, as has been pointed out many times, a big chunk of rationality is ... how did someone put it... "non-self-sabotage", or some such
[23:43:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> i.e., not being stupid
[23:44:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> You can be fairly successful but then you come to a situation where rationality skills would've helped, you don't have any, and bam: you fuck yourself over
[23:44:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> I'm watching it happen right now with a relative of mine, as it happens
[23:45:17] <zebrask> Obormot\Arcturus: I mean, I usually find the actual value of rationality is in setting up convenient frameworks for exploring conceptual spaces, but life for humans is easy enough that it doesn't necessarily require that sort of thing to be generally happy.
[23:45:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> Fairly successful person life- and career-wise, but now they're in a situation where they have to make certain consequential life decisions, and they're making really elementary mistakes rationality-wise, behaving according to very obvious and extremely dumb biases, and thereby throwing away massive piles of value
[23:46:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> zebrask: mmm well I don't usually go for this angle but, honestly, that is a perspective of substantial and pervasive privilege
[23:46:18] <rmmh> autists unable to understand why other people aren't entranced by systematizing the world, news at 11
[23:46:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> Life for some humans is "easy enough" in that respect; for most humans, no
[23:47:14] <zebrask> Same way you can get swole by eating the right amount of protein and the optimal workout routine, but you'll still get pretty big if you just kinda eat what you feel like and work out all the time.
[23:47:39] <galambo> Obormot\Arcturus, I read te 
[23:47:46] <galambo> the review
[23:48:07] <galambo> I did not enjoy reading the book either
[23:48:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> My experience is that in everyday situations most people do ok, but *multiple times* I have found myself in "crisis" or otherwise unusual situations, and the difference between me (having read the Sequences and so on) and other people (behaving according to extremely dumb biases and uncontrolled emotional responses) was just shocking
[23:48:32] <galambo> but the scout mindset is your best shot at introducing an iq 80 normie to the concepts of rationality without scaring them off
[23:48:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't consider myself a particularly impressive rationalist, to be clear!
[23:48:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> I'm talking about really quite basic stuff
[23:49:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> galambo: Uhh you surely mean "IQ 110", right
[23:49:10] <zebrask> I mean for my purposes that basically doesn't matter because the vast majority of my social circle is people in first world countries with no immediate material needs.
[23:49:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> galambo: IQ 80 ain't even gonna understand the *sentences* in half the book
[23:49:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> zebrask: I live in a first world country too...
[23:49:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> zebrask: Shit happens regardless
[23:49:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> Again, this sort of thing can come out of nowhere
[23:50:13] <galambo> Obormot\Arcturus, what are you talking about? iq 110 is smarter than 75% of the population
[23:50:38] <galambo> ok maybe iq 90
[23:50:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> galambo: No I meant 110
[23:50:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes that means 75% of the population won't get this book
[23:51:22] <zebrask> But also "easy enough" is a relative term, and relative to like... non-human life on Earth, we've got it very easy. Humans are very "OP" for the game of life. The only problem is that when you are a human your ecological niche is populated by other humans, so you have to compete with other "OP" creatures.
[23:51:27] <galambo> Obormot\Arcturus, I dont think people are that stupid
[23:51:40] <galambo> this is like 6th grader comprehension level
[23:51:54] <galambo> the book I mean
[23:52:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> galambo: https://paulcooijmans.com/intelligence/iq_ranges.html
[23:52:01] <Robomot> I.Q. ranges and real-life functioning
[23:52:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> zebrask: Yes, you have indeed correctly identified the counterargument to your argument :p
[23:52:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> Our environment is humans
[23:53:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> Which means our environment is populated by strongly adversarial agents at all times
[23:53:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> This is much worse than just potentially falling off a cliff and dying
[23:53:45] <kuudes> hmm, I wonder up to what grade iq 100 people increase effective iq
[23:54:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> galambo: Notice that you have to get to IQ 100 before you even reach "able to learn from written materials"
[23:54:31] <galambo> Obormot\Arcturus, anyways the scout mindset is your best shot at the lowest common denominator. but there are better books that cover the same topics.
[23:54:35] <ggreer> besides The Scout Mindset, I don't think there's much reading to be done. more effective is simply living life like a rationalist. a decent amount of my thinking has rubbed off on my gf over the past couple of years
[23:55:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> That is a good point, yeah
[23:55:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> Social mimicry is a powerful thing
[23:55:45] <galambo> Obormot\Arcturus, this means half the population is incapable of learning from written materials
[23:55:49] <galambo> thats crazy
[23:55:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> galambo: That's correct
[23:56:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> More, in some countries!
[23:56:07] <spxtr> galambo: not too crazy, really. Have you met people?
[23:56:55] <adiabatic> he meets people in his day job
[23:56:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> Though this list's characterization of IQs about 110-115 is not accurate
[23:57:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> It goes off the rails after that
[23:57:17] <galambo> my iq on iqtest.dk was 119. this list makes me feel bad.
[23:57:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> You gotta compress the numbers by 1.5 or so to get the right values
[23:57:24] <zebrask> Yeah, I'm just not entirely convinced that the Sequences or the sort of rational thinking you'd get from general exposure to that philsophical worldview would make the difference between dire poverty and immense riches.
[23:57:25] <kuudes> galambo, 1/6 of people are unable to turn to next page in task of "get phone number of person whose name starts with M, on this page are persons named A-L"
[23:57:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> galambo: Yeah that's about where it stops being accurate
[23:57:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> zebrask: That's not what I said
[23:57:53] <adiabatic> zebrask: occasionally I'll pull out a thing like the parable of rubes and bleggs
[23:58:19] <galambo> zebrask, I think the main advantage of the sequences is that it stops you from making stupid mistakes
[23:58:27] <zebrask> In my experience, the sort of severe life-altering irrationalities I see in my social circles are due to like, mental illness or at least some sort of neuro-atypicality.
[23:58:39] <galambo> which is actually a really really good skill
[23:58:49] <adiabatic> or try and get someone to say what he means by, say "capitalism" instead of using it as a boo-word
[23:59:24] <adiabatic> ("capitalism" is a hypothetical example; my general impression is that people who use that word a lot have brain worms and can't be rescued)
[23:59:46] <Betawolf> A lot of people (over 1 in 4) just don't read any books at all. 
[23:59:53] <zebrask> spxtr: I doubt it.
