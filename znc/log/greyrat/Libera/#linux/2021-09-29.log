[01:55:08] <TheGuestMovie> Anyone familiar with Java packages here? When I try to run "java" before it's installed on Ubuntu 20.04, it proposes 4 packages: openjdk-11-jre-headless, openjdk-11-jre-headless, openjdk-13-jre-headless, and openjdk-16-jre-headless. From what I've read about Java, it's always backwards compatible, so even applications written for Java 2 will work
[01:55:09] <TheGuestMovie> on the latest Java. So what's the benefit of keeping all these packages instead of just Java 16?
[01:55:42] <TheGuestMovie> sorry, let me change the question: what's the benefit for a regular user, to install anything but the latest
[01:56:03] <TheGuestMovie> I'm sure different versions will have different settings that people running services care about. Like --flag1 which was removed from a newer version.

[03:01:00] <pendarsoheil> I require executing an IPMI executable 10 times but the script only works _well_ when it is executed independently 10 times manually. If I place the script within a while loop it will not work. This of course is pretty ambiguous but are there any peculiarities about while loops which may make this happen?

[06:27:24] <rascul> tar_xvf bash has a concept of exported variables, and only the exported ones are given to a new process
[06:27:39] <rascul> env would show the exported variables
[06:27:53] <rustytaco> rascul: this is annoying because it seems the act of plugging in the lan cable causes it to check the wifi networks eventually (within a minute or so) otehrwise it never connects to the hotspot. The idea is - if i come with my phone in hotspot, it should connect there, so i can connect my laptop to it and everything just works (TM) but that doesnt happen :(
[06:28:00] <rascul> tar_xvf i don't know what the problem you referred to was, though
[06:28:37] <rascul> rustytaco sounds like maybe you need something like networkmanager or connman to control your wifi interface
[06:28:50] <rustytaco> iwctl is supposed to do that
[06:28:59] <twainwek> raspbian does some odd stuff for rpi
[06:29:12] <twainwek> like they have a way to specify network configuration in the boot partition
[06:29:16] <tar_xvf> rascul: the problem i was talking about is there was a scheduled script which ran `go run main.go` and since $GOPATH wasn't defined in the scheduled task but it was defined by .bash_rc defining exported variables into the script solved my issue

[06:48:28] <tar_xvf> yeah GOPATH is usually only for building but the application (it was for webircgateway) runs by calling `go run main.go` for some reason.
[06:48:42] <n4dir> java sounds like what you learn in german universities.
[06:48:46] <rascul> i wonder if you can run main.go directly
[06:48:52] <rascul> aren't go binaries static and stuff?
[06:49:00] <tar_xvf> maybe it's a way to have pseudo-dynamic linked dependencies???

[07:46:03] <bullgard4> [Debian stable] I have (automatically) generated a file with an ".sqbpro" extension. Using the gedit editor the contents starts with the string "<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><sqlb_project>. I find the content difficult to read and comprehend. What utility will present this content in a more structured and thus more comprehensible way?
[07:47:49] <[[R]]> well if you've got X working...
[07:48:35] <bullgard4> X is working all right.

[11:21:57] <wyclif> I hate how some IRC channels ban you and nag you to "fix your connection" when you're coming in over a bad southeast Asian connection. It's enough to get my to try Discord
[11:22:52] <wyclif> I have no power to "fix my connection" when the country I'm staying in is mostly a copper wire network and it's typhoon season
[11:23:07] <xiaomiao> wyclif: you could get a VPS somewhere to have a stable endpoint, and connect from that
[11:23:31] <wyclif> I do have a VPS, and I did try that, but there's a problem.
[11:23:42] <efil4cri> "fix your connection" - all of irc users
[11:24:03] <wyclif> IRC networks like Libera won't whitelist your IPs, and you can't log in

[16:58:37] <n4dir> sudorm: you could ask the refracta guy how big it is after installation. Comes with xfce and sure firefox, install iso is rather small, i don't remember the size *after* installing (you could still remove whatever you don't need). based on devuan.
[16:58:56] <sudorm> n4dir, thanks i'll have a look!
[16:59:12] <sudorm> among the top 10 well known distro, which ones are the most lightweight once installed?
[16:59:30] <n4dir> sudorm: i think it changed, but his goal always was to have it installable via CD, no USB needed. So being small was always one of the main goals
[16:59:47] <n4dir> sudorm: light regarding CPU and RAM usage?
[17:00:01] <Penagwin> sudorm I know nothing about it, but Porteus looks like it would fit
[17:00:23] <Penagwin> Alpine would work great but that's much closer to arch in terms of setup
[17:00:29] <Penagwin> Same with Nixos
[17:00:47] <n4dir> funny enough i just installed antix, and am now down to 13 MB after booting, before X comes into it. Using runit though

[17:04:04] <Penagwin> Is there a particular reason why it needs to be under 1GB of storage? Generally your memory is far more limiting then your disk storage, and most of the "lightweight" wellknown distros weigh in around 2GB to 10GB of disk usage

[18:04:20] <peetaur> res is surely dedicated to the process; and that ram limit you set would be in here....but ballooning may show it lower than you set; and also included is stuff like the qemu binary in RAM, static libs that are linked in it I guess, and whatever it allocated

[18:05:31] <ruc2625> fdan: personally i use symlinks if if i want to link somthing across file systems or if i want "secondary" names for one original name.
[18:05:47] <peetaur> and there's a thing where it deduplicates RAM ....this is disabled by default, but I think maybe in PVE it's enabled
[18:06:13] <peetaur> that feature doesn't do much normally, but if you have 1000 of the same OS loaded, maybe it would...so it's typically considered useful on hypervisors
[18:06:20] <tuxinator> fdan: let me try to summarize: SomeFilename1 -> Inode123 (per filesystem unique), hardlink -> Someadditionalfilename2 -> Inode123 , Symlink -> Linkfilename  -> Link to  Somefilename1. Also important to know, Hardlinked file is only deleted when all Hardlinks are deleted. Btw using hardlinks one can do some sort of "deduplication"

On my earlier PCIe3 servers, SPDK replaces the linux nvme drivers with uio-pci-generic.  On the gen 4 servers it uses vfio, and this is causing me headaches.  I have tried to the best of my ability to get that server to use uio-pci-generic and failed.  Can anyone help?

[21:41:42] <Psi-Jack> I don't want my distro to make ME maintain it. I want my distro to be self sufficient. So I use Fedora for my desktops. 🙂
[21:41:56] <naptastic> schemanic, /directory/. is the same as /directory/ which is the same as /directory
[21:42:00] <Sauvin> I use Ubuntu for the same reason.
[21:42:26] <clemens3> schemanic: content goes into $DIRY
[21:42:26] <naptastic> schemanic, this is because the file named "." in every directory is a reference to the directory itself
[21:43:32] <schemanic> naptastic you're saying there's no difference between '$DIRX/.' and '$DIRX/'? functionally? Or is it different in that we're intending for cp -a to work on the directory itself and it's content?

[22:06:30] <matsaman> Gustavo6046: it's too late, we have the science saying it's beneficial in moderation
[22:06:33] <matsaman> like so many things
[22:06:49] <Gustavo6046> Then again pH is relative and we DEFINED water as the zero pH........ riight?
[22:06:51] <Penagwin> Gustavo6046 Yes but it's an "acid" when used in solutions that have a PH higher then 7
[22:06:54] <matsaman> water can have any ph you want
[22:06:58] <Gustavo6046> Oh wait, not right. pH is the ratio between floating hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions
[22:06:59] <Penagwin> also 0 is a strong acid

[22:27:51] <naptastic> such a win
[22:27:54] <Penagwin> matsaman generally "depressant" means a central nervous system depressant - this means it slows you down and isn't related to depression itself
[22:27:56] <Gustavo6046> naptastic: yup!
[22:28:13] <Gustavo6046> also what Penagwin said
[22:28:42] <Penagwin> Anything that affects dopamine will train your behaviour
[22:29:00] <Penagwin> It's kinda bizarre to explain, your brain is constantly learning, and not based on your "thoughts" but by your dopamine
[22:29:13] <Gustavo6046> Like it or not, we humans are little beyond simple machines
[22:29:19] <Gustavo6046> Our brains develop to maximize reward
[22:29:30] <naptastic> matsaman, benzodiazepines can also be effective antidepressants (if the depression is driven by overactivation of the HPA axis which is... pretty much everybody right now) and they are "CNS depressants" because they lower neural firing rates and metabolic activity
[22:29:30] * rustytaco chews on some forbidden leaves and watches the conversation
[22:29:31] <Gustavo6046> Each neuron is an atomic unit of abstraction
[22:29:34] <matsaman> mine is developed to minimize beer in the world
[22:29:35] <Penagwin> It's just a simple optimization problem basically
[22:30:19] <Gustavo6046> The senses are the inputs from the environment, the actions are the outputs into the environment (such as speaking or breathing or walking or eating or typing random crap on IRC), the thinking and deciding is internal to the brain itself

[22:30:22] *** Quits: tieinv (~tieinv@user/tieinv) (Quit: Leaving)
[22:30:34] <Gustavo6046> A brain is just biological machine learning, and dopamine is the reward function.
[22:30:55] <naptastic> put an asterisk after that :P
[22:30:56] <paulcarroty> if you really needs antidepressants - talk with professional first
[22:31:00] <Penagwin> ^
[22:31:29] <Penagwin> dopamine and your cannibanoid system are used by your brain for attention prioritization
[22:31:32] <naptastic> it's about (1) unexpected reward and (2) anticipation of reward (and thus driver of behavior)
[22:31:39] <Penagwin> since if everything was important, nothing is important
[22:31:44] <matsaman> running is an anti-depressant
[22:31:48] <Gustavo6046> naptastic: yes, we are able to abstract that
[22:32:08] <Gustavo6046> Neurons operate both spatially (that is, with regards to other neurons) and temporally.
[22:32:12] <paulcarroty> I hate beer, lol. Crazy bad taste.
[22:32:30] <rustytaco> I hate bad beer. Good beer tastes pretty aite tho
[22:32:38] <Penagwin> matsaman It is to a degree. And you do need excercise to be healthy, but it won't cure depression on it's own. Keep in mind depression normally causes people to hide, the idea of leaving your house is nearly unthinkable
[22:32:40] <matsaman> paulcarroty: you should probably drink dark beer, then
[22:32:43] <rustytaco> American style beer falls undre the bad beer category
[22:32:46] <Penagwin> also exercise can trigger panic attacks in some people
[22:32:48] <naptastic> Gustavo6046, ok, just so we're clear, rewards do not always produce dopamine. That becomes important in the study of depression. :)
[22:32:59] <matsaman> Penagwin: what cures depression then?
[22:33:08] <Gustavo6046> rustytaco: I tried wine once a few months ago (after a very shy sip another few months before that), it was mega bitter and I never liked alcoholic drinks anymore. The end.
[22:33:13] <Gustavo6046> naptastic: yup.
[22:33:23] <rustytaco> most wine is also pretty gross
[22:33:29] <Gustavo6046> A lack of dopamine can generate depression, i.e. a lack of motivation to go after the things that reward you in the first plavce.
[22:33:31] <Gustavo6046> place*
[22:33:32] <rustytaco> Meade is aite tho. not all gross and bitter
[22:33:49] <naptastic> matsaman, depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide. We've got about 60 different theories about what causes and none of them explain it completely. There isn't a cure and there may never be one.
[22:33:58] <Gustavo6046> It is easy to look at this and take a hedonistic point of view about human behaviour and life goals, as if depression is the lack of pleasure, then the best life must be the opposite – the maximization of pleasure!
[22:34:00] <rustytaco> the alcohol component itself isnt so much an acquired taste as a tolerance to the taste ;)
[22:34:11] <Penagwin> naptastic I'm pretty sure they do. Your brain releases a little dopamine when you think of something. It releases a lot more if you trained it (the smell of weed for example). It releases a ton when you use it. It then compensates to keep it baseline, which is why it's hard to "peak" multiple times with many drugs, and why you have withdrawl (when
[22:34:11] <Penagwin> your brain compensates to keep it low but you dont use it)
[22:34:22] * Sauvin is in the US and has a strong tendency to prefer imported or microbrasserie beers
[22:34:24] <matsaman> naptastic: there's a cure for everything, even if that thing is really thousands of things
[22:34:43] <Gustavo6046> matsaman: Oh yeah? What's the cure for cancer?
[22:34:48] <Gustavo6046> Spill it out, bad boy! SPILL IT!
[22:34:53] <Penagwin> matsaman I'll let you know when I figure it out :( Sadly its different for everyone
[22:34:54] <rustytaco> Sauvin: Our style of beer isn't impressive to say the least. we have some great domestic breweries..but far too much "american style" beer ;)
[22:34:57] <matsaman> Gustavo6046: we actually do have some solutions to a variety of cancers
[22:34:58] <Gustavo6046> (If it's pseudo-science you literally just died in all of our collective eyes!)
[22:35:04] <paulcarroty> matsaman: I tried, but prefer to drink juice, great taske & much more healthy
[22:35:06] <Gustavo6046> Yeah we do have chemotherapy and radiotherapy and stuff
[22:35:08] <Gustavo6046> But those aren't cures.
[22:35:10] <Gustavo6046> They're therapiest
[22:35:13] <Penagwin> matsaman think of depression more as a "misstrained brain"
[22:35:15] <matsaman> Gustavo6046: no they aren't, but we have vaccines
[22:35:19] <Gustavo6046> They CAN help cure cancer but don't outright cure them
[22:35:22] <Gustavo6046> o.o cancer vaccines
[22:35:25] <Sauvin> American "style" beer isn't beer. It's mostly water with traces of cat piss.
[22:35:29] <matsaman> cancerS, there are so many
[22:35:36] <matsaman> and for a few of them we have really effective solutions
[22:35:40] <Gustavo6046> ^
[22:35:52] <matsaman> although most of them, I would say, the solution is to stop poisoning our environments and our bodies
[22:35:53] <Gustavo6046> Sauvin: lots of cats roaming around, gotta do something with them
[22:35:54] <naptastic> Penagwin, there are two separate things happening there; you think of your pipe and *bing* dopamine, so you wanna hit it. If you do, THC hits your CB1 receptors and *bing* you're relaxed. The dopamine isn't what makes you feel good, except in the way that feeling motivated feels good.
[22:35:55] <Gustavo6046> Sauvin: ooh
[22:36:00] <Gustavo6046> what if we established a dairy industry around cats?
[22:36:01] <RayTracer> Sauvin: oh, I thought it was dog
[22:36:04] <matsaman> a lot of that obviously only works for future generations, of course, perhaps
[22:36:19] <matsaman> Penagwin: I think that's loading the word too much
[22:36:20] <Gustavo6046> So we rescue street cats and make them healthy and stuff
[22:36:22] <matsaman> Penagwin: perhaps it can be that
[22:36:30] <matsaman> Penagwin: or perhaps you are just sad and have legitimate reason to be
[22:36:34] <Gustavo6046> And then we sell their milk (Pasteurized of course) in order to make this a sustainable venture
[22:36:44] <matsaman> but if you _don't want to be_, there is a lot you can do to not be so sad
[22:36:45] <Gustavo6046> Not from the males lol. That would be weeeeeeeeeeeeeeird.
[22:37:04] <Penagwin> naptastic I agree the CB system is the the main affect with weed but I've very certain it releases a decent amount dopamine
[22:37:34] <Penagwin> naptastic I say this because I've also taken gabapentin, which is known to affect dopamine, and there's a certain affect it has that's hard to explain
[22:38:02] <Gustavo6046> I know it sounds cursed
[22:38:02] <Penagwin> I took it as prescribed, but when I was first taking it I was _not_ going to miss a dose
[22:38:14] <Gustavo6046> But we already milk goats and cows and a plethora of other probably random animals
[22:38:16] <JamesFerret> First day here, didn't anticipate this thread
[22:38:16] <Gustavo6046> Why not cats?
[22:38:35] <rud0lf> we milk almonds
[22:38:47] <naptastic> Penagwin, yeah, that's not a great benchmark; its main target is one calcium channel subunit and the dopamine stuff is secondary or less. It also affects everyone so very differently, the only commonality it seems to have is the "stoned" feeling.
[22:38:55] <JamesFerret> What do you guys think about depression's relation to addiction?
[22:38:56] <Gustavo6046> rud0lf: We milk the Earth! We already attained the end game of milking things.

[22:41:02] <Penagwin> JamesFerret When you have depression you just don't feel happiness. When I'm depressed I literally can't remember ever being happy, and I'm completely unable to imagine ever feeling happy again
[22:41:04] <paulcarroty> cow milk are unique for human, crazy percent of adsorbtion
[22:41:25] <JamesFerret> Yeah, sadly can relate
[22:41:31] <Penagwin> So when you add a substance that can make you feel "okay" for just a little bit.... You can see where that goes
[22:41:38] <naptastic> Penagwin, the crazy thing about weed is that, if you follow the chain of molecular signals from THC to CB1 to Gi (I think?) the answer is basically "it slows down the mitochondria in the safest way possible." If your depression is driven by anxiety, that's gonna feel great.
[22:41:51] <Penagwin> Then after taking the substance for a while you'll feel terrible if you stop. ALso you still have depression
[22:41:59] <JamesFerret> That's the thing though does it only fuel it

[22:42:31] <Penagwin> part of it helps anxiety
[22:42:59] <Penagwin> But regular usage causes panic problems
[22:43:01] <naptastic> it's a coin with two sides for sure.

[23:34:05] <Gustavo6046> The idea is that if you ssh nethack@alpinist.ygg (where alpinist.ygg is a Yggdrasil IPv6 you're supposed to add to /etc/hosts after setting up Yggdrasil), you'll be greeted with a username prompt, and then you can either login or register depending on whether that username exists.
[23:34:18] <Gustavo6046> Then you can manage your user, and even play NetHack. Kind of like a BBS.
[23:34:34] <Gustavo6046> Heck, I just want a BBS that's actually an user shell that is accessible via SSH.
[23:34:35] <ayecee> seems like you might be reinventing a wheel here, with regards to authentication

[23:34:49] <Psi-Jack> Gustavo6046: Synchronet?

[23:35:19] <Psi-Jack> BBS*
[23:35:35] <Gustavo6046> so you ssh to this "user" and either the chsh or the current shell's RC is actually an interface into an inbox/message system and also allows you to play NetHack.
