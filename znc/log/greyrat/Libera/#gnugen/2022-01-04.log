[01:31:36] <Orbstheorem> So, I learned two things:
[01:31:36] <Orbstheorem> - bind9 is a beast (as expected), but it will also hit the network very hard. To the point where my home router can't keep up with the number of packets.
[01:31:36] <Orbstheorem> - I've got lots to think of about how things can be done differently on ipv6 than ipv4.

[14:08:32] <artectrex[m]> Update on my Nextcloud woes: ./occ commands also have a 20s latency
[14:09:29] <artectrex[m]> Anyway, I'm just doing a backup/restore (a clean `docker-compose up` has no issues)

[14:25:28] <Orbstheorem> [Full log](https://paste.gnugen.ch/paste/8m8Z)
[14:26:07] <Orbstheorem> I had plans to write my own backup trasfer/state management based on snapper.
[14:26:28] <Orbstheorem> But then I rediscovered btrfk, which has changed a lot since last time I checked it out.
[14:27:27] <Orbstheorem> Funny enough, it follows the same principle that my "manual backup scripts", that I've been using for ages now, with a broken systemd service that breaks every now and then...
[14:29:12] <Orbstheorem> Backups for days!
[14:29:24] <GermainZ> It's good to keep your backup system exciting. I recommend sticking to your broken scripts
[14:43:11] <Orbstheorem> s/`//, s/`//, s///
[14:43:12] <Orbstheorem> One of the things that had been preventing me from fully automating backups is that `btrfs receive` requires remote root, which I'm not confortable giving willy-nilly to a non-interactive automated script. btrbk solves this with [`ssh_filter_btrbk`](https://digint.ch/btrbk/doc/ssh_filter_btrbk.1.html):...
