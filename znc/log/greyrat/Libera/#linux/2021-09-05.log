[01:08:23] <ayecee> mh_le: i think you should stop asking that on repeat.
[01:08:34] <TJ-> euouae: case in point. I use systemd extensively for some sophisticated stuff including core of a simple replacement for Kubernetes. Last week found an issue with the container manager/creator systemd-nspawn and systemd-networkd interacting badly and networkd removing containers from an existing Bridge interface that nspawn had just added the containers to. Put in a feature request asking to allow
[01:08:36] <TJ-> "Bridge=inherit" and within 23 hours there's a new feature been added "KeepMaster= and it doesn't just cover Bridges, it covers other kinds of interfaces too

[05:00:13] <Dagmar> One of thsoe things "guest addons" in virtual do is get the kernel to do a sync when necessary to clear out their filesystem caches so that the RAM is truly free
[05:00:27] <ayecee> if you overcommit beyond the amount of ram, it'll just be uncomfortable.
[05:00:52] <hajonnes> sheep, is there a way to make the service I have created to exectue later in the boot process? Thereby perhaps not be made inactive? I do not know about udev, do you think I should look in to it?
[05:01:08] <ayecee> the guest addons also contain a balloon device that is important in that case too.
[05:01:14] <sheep> hajonnes: it's a oneshot service so it always becomes inactive after it starts
[05:01:21] <tsapien> ram and relationships...both things you don't want to overcommit to unless there's a good reason

[05:02:27] <Two_Dogs_> sheep, timer?

So you've two choices: 1) spend some time trying to figure out what the holders are, and how to drop them  or 2) reboot without every attaching the USB3 device and hope the uas module isn't required and therefore doesn't get loaded

[14:45:39] <lockywolf>  Is there a feature in Linux to do "multiple-redundant" level3 interface bonding? So that, say, I have a point to point tunnel, which is supported by three underlying IP connections, and the other end is reconstructing the connection from three flows? If each underlying connection has little loss, it could be used to increase speed, and if loss is large, compensate for it.

[15:34:28] <MinusOne> TideLI, this is also a problem that could be solved with docker or a VM, then you can isolate the network configuration you need for that service to the environment in which that service runs. If that is easier and feasible for you.

[15:54:31] <TJ-> TideLI: As a Pro Tip: my bet is the VPN doesn't affect the IPv6 routes. If I am correct, and your PC also has IPv6 address allocated, you'll still be able to connect to the RasPi using IPv6 when the VPN is up and IPv4 is broken
[15:54:41] <TideLI> TJ- This is a fresh install so nothing yet. I tried both openvpn and wireguard last week and had the same results. My VPN also offers their own inhouse client.

[18:25:42] <tomreyn> thyriaen: on asus first gen zen mainboards (3xx chipset), there would be a "Power Supply Idle Control" setting which can be set to "auto" or "typical current idle". while the former would be the default setting, the latter would disable C6 package, effectively consuming a litle bit more power while idle. but so little that you'll probably not notice it. enough to not have the system accidentially power off, though

[18:31:09] <tomreyn> thyriaen: that's a very different symptom

[19:34:22] <ayecee> i'd hazard a guess that borgmatic is logging to both stderr and syslog
[19:34:43] <ayecee> and systemd is capturing and logging the stderr, as it does
[19:35:07] <Psi-Jack> Hmmmm, you know... That might actually be it. It has an option for --log-file to log to a file instead of to syslog.

[19:43:12] <tetrapod> Heey can someone explain to me how to mount ntfs (so not ntfs-3g !) with certain permissions? Right now I get rwx------ for root, but I want access for another user as well.
[19:43:28] <tetrapod> Also, why does ntfs mount with write permissions with the driver only supports read anyway?
[19:43:57] <djph> tetrapod: ntfs3g
[19:44:05] <djph> *ntfs3g supports write
[19:44:17] <tetrapod> I know, but i'm not using 3g
[19:44:21] <ayecee> tetrapod: because there's limited write support in the kernel driver. only for writing within a file, without changing size, suitable for loopback mounts.
[19:44:22] <Psi-Jack> ayecee: TUI ones or GUI ones or both, cause I don't know if that would even work in any GUI client.
[19:44:47] <ayecee> Psi-Jack: both

[19:46:42] <Psi-Jack> ayecee: It doesn't. They have GUI options/toggles for it, and HexChat specifically has a /set irc_conf_mode 1 since it doesn't do it per-channel, but globally.
[19:46:43] <ayecee> tetrapod: in the mount manpage, search for ntfs, and you'll find uid/gid/umask options

[20:01:44] <orcalikastecona> just an if statement to check if the first character of the string is a '\n'. increments the cursors y position and sets the x_pos to 0
[20:02:10] <orcalikastecona> there is an if statement like that already in the code, but I guess it wasn't running. I added mine higher up in the output function and it runs
[20:02:20] <ayecee> oldgalileo: if it's like MBR, it uses start block and length, not start block and end block
[20:02:46] <orcalikastecona> It calls a tui_puts function before checking for the '\n', I'm thinking that function mucks with the string pointer so it doesn't see the '\n' after returning from it
[20:02:59] <orcalikastecona> I put my if statement above that function call and it seems to work fine

[20:13:01] <uwharrie> rud0lf: you'd unpack things in /usr/local/stow/node/{bin,lib,share,...} then the stow command would symlink everything into /usr/local/{bin,lib,share,...}
[20:13:01] <ayecee> rud0lf: you can remove the symlinks to files, though, that point to the directory you remove
[20:13:18] <ayecee> ah, that looks promising.
[20:13:19] <oldgalileo> rud0lf: This is a pretty bad suggestion considering your problem almost _guaranteed_ does not require this, but you are describing in a very very very small way what OverlayFS does.
[20:13:47] <oldgalileo> rud0lf: Stow looks wicked cool though. I'd probably go for that. Never heard of it but reading over it now and it seems like a reasonable solution to your problem.

[21:08:11] <ayecee> their memories are long but not always accurate, and the missing pieces are often backfilled from other sources.
[21:08:28] <DLange> it is also filled with masses of advertising
[21:08:36] <ayecee> yeah but that's not the reason.
[21:08:37] <cashew> WeeChat uptime: 0 days 06:47:20, started on Sun Sep  5 11:51:17 2021
[21:08:46] <ayecee> DLange: if it were, raw links would be fine.
[21:09:00] <akik> i have a controversial idea, click the raw link after pasting your stuff
[21:09:18] <DLange> these don't work for everbody as they ban their direct use for some networks
[21:09:21] <ayecee> DLange: also other pastebins with ads are permitted.
[21:09:24] <THE_GFR|W> ayecee: I did a test, I started a new image with the names the same except for .iso extension and it corrupted.
[21:09:29] <DLange> e.g. our sauvin had that issue
[21:09:52] <THE_GFR|W> ayecee: I started it again with the log file having a different name, without deleting the image first.  No corruption
[21:09:56] <ayecee> does our sauvin still have that issue
[21:10:12] <DLange> yes, hence he changed the topic yesterday
[21:10:22] <ayecee> what happens when he uses a raw link
[21:10:33] <THE_GFR|W> ayecee: I then deleted the image and started ddrescue over again with the log file having a different name and it worked fine
[21:11:01] <DLange> ayecee: no idea, I am not his IT guy. Neither are you.
[21:11:08] <esselfe> Anyone knows of a good GTK 3 programming guide? I'm doing a chrono and did ncurses and xlib already. Next is QT5
[21:11:14] <hexnewbie> pastebin.com simply pastes don't open for some of us
[21:11:14] <THE_GFR|W> so what I am seeing here is that the image and log file must have different names since it appears to be ignoring the extension in the name.
[21:11:19] <ayecee> DLange: is the policy because raw links don't work for him?
[21:11:30] <DLange> and for many other people
[21:11:41] <ayecee> and that he gets ads if he doesn't use raw links?
[21:11:43] <THE_GFR|W> basically unique names ignoring extensions because otherwise ddrescue says they are the same file
[21:12:01] <DLange> they seem to engange their "anti raw link measure" based on source networks / IP ranges
[21:12:04] <ayecee> THE_GFR|W: i don't think this is anything with how ddrescue operates
[21:12:07] <THE_GFR|W> which is a change from how it was doing it before
[21:12:22] <THE_GFR|W> ayecee: maybe it's related to the newer versions of Samba?
[21:12:23] <ayecee> THE_GFR|W: it is more likely something to do with how your nas operates
[21:12:28] <ayecee> probably not samba either
[21:12:31] <ayecee> probably your nas
[21:12:47] <DLange> 18:19 <DLange> that sounds more like an issue of what provides the storage service to your ddrescue-running box

[21:14:10] <THE_GFR|W> ayecee: it's a server running a RAID and it runs Linux Mint 20.2 MATE

[21:19:56] <ayecee> THE_GFR|W: i don't think it'll keep working.
[21:20:31] <Gustavo6046> how do I inspect the state of the TCP buffers? I often have Tx but no Rx, or Rx but no Tx, because of wifi, for minutes straight, e.g. mtr to 9.9.9.9 and I only get pongs from hops 1 (192.168.0.1) and 3, and mtr to 192.168.0.1 I get none (which is almost paradoxical), or I receive messages online but can't send any; and it's really bugging me out.
[21:20:36] <Gustavo6046> Oh there we go
[21:20:40] <THE_GFR|W> ayecee: why do you say that?
[21:20:54] <THE_GFR|W> because the names shouldn't matter right?

[21:21:01] <Gustavo6046> Pay attention to the timestamps
[21:21:12] <ayecee> THE_GFR|W: because i can't imagine a mechanism for it to work, and i've thought i'd fixed something before only to find out it wasn't fixed.
[21:21:59] <ayecee> THE_GFR|W: often because i'd accidentally frobbed the real cause of the problem while doing the test
[21:22:05] <THE_GFR|W> ayecee: well when I write data locally and not across the network I can have the names the same which makes me wonder if it isn't SMB in this instance being weird as it's a much newer version vs what I had on my old system
