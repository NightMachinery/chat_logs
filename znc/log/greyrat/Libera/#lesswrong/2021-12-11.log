[00:13:01] <ggreer> I think injecting it is more efficient and hits much faster
[00:14:08] <ggreer> if it was fentanyl or some synthetic opiate, I could see the fatal amount being so tiny that nobody could taste it. hell, don't cops sometimes pass out from simply touching fentanyl?

[03:52:23] <gwern> when you can't find any other server, and no other serve can find you, hard to be overloaded
[03:52:42] <quanticle> "AWS Lambda APIs and invocation of Lambda functions operated normally throughout the event.

[07:42:50] <kuudes> but good work, quanticle :)
[07:43:11] <quanticle> Salt
[07:43:22] <quanticle> I don't have a heated driveway lol
[07:43:59] <quanticle> Oh, the pink thing is a utility flag
[07:44:10] <adiabatic> how much salt does it take to keep that driveway de-iced?
[07:44:31] <adiabatic> (in pounds; I can imagine carrying bags of salt…)_
[07:44:36] <quanticle> Over the course of a winter, about 80 pounds
[07:44:38] <quanticle> 2 bags
[07:44:57] <adiabatic> "a little less than two bars". Got it.
[07:45:05] <gwern> I wonder how many man-years of salt requirements that is. a medieval peasant might have to slave for decades to import that much salt
[07:45:14] <quanticle> I was thinking about that, actually
[07:45:35] <kuudes> how does it affect the water basin etc? O_o
[07:45:38] <quanticle> Like, imagine telling a Briton in 1300 that eventually salt is cheap enough that we can scatter it on our roads to keep them deiced
[07:46:04] <CoJaBo> So there'd a video of a halfdeer on Reddit right now. I've seen three of these at our middle-of-nowhere office. But how.
[07:46:13] <gwern> a what
[07:46:15] <adiabatic> what's the not-deer half?
[07:46:19] <quanticle> Half deer, half what?
[07:46:26] <gwern> half furry, one hopes
[07:47:53] <gwern> yeah, that's kinda crazy. but if you explained it in terms of cheap transport, I'm not sure if he'd find it *that* crazy... it was known that big salt deposits existed and you could do things like heavily salt stuff like cod. not sure if anyone, even the elite, would know about, say, mummifying using salt. but the existence of cheap large quantities of salt was not itself astonishing, just...
[07:47:59] <gwern> ...that you'd be able to get it transported to you *so* cheap far away from any salt flat that you could just dump it on the ground?
[07:49:26] <quanticle> kuudes: It's not great for the water table and/or soil
[07:49:35] <saturn2> i imagine they'd understand once you explained that you needed the salt so your magic self-moving cart would work
[07:49:36] <quanticle> We have seagrass growing in our highway medians
[07:50:27] <gwern> 'but how can you afford it, when you don't live next to a pier? surely the cart fees would bankrupt you' 'i'll need to explain how carts work'
[07:51:58] <kuudes> I mean, if you put it that way, a self driving car <- human driven car is much less of difference than self moving car <- horse moving car

[09:17:16] <enterprisey> I realized it wasn't energy-efficient to worry about it, and besides, it's not that bad
[09:19:16] <kiboneu> yeah it could be worse
[09:30:10] <dv2> I just don't get all the white space. If I wanted a narrower view I would just resize my window. Why force it on me?

[09:43:38] <enterprisey> dv2, I've heard that view for a long time, but I've come to the conclusion that the user base in general is best served with text at a reasonable width
[09:43:44] <spxtr> I use a tiling window manager so it's maximized unless it make it floating but why would I do that
[09:43:59] <enterprisey> wanting text to go all the way across the screen is niche enough that such users should have to do CSS hax
[09:44:40] <enterprisey> example: tiling window manager users sometimes want text to do that. if you're using a tiling window manager, you're definitely within the top 0.X% of technical ability, so go do CSS hax
[09:52:14] <quanticle> Yeah, just install Stylus, lol
[09:55:33] <PapuaHardyNet> nah, I highly doubt tiling window manager users are within the top 0.x% of technical ability
[09:55:36] <PapuaHardyNet> maybe top x%

[13:03:33] <Robomot> Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and the Island of Misfit Toys - Wikipedia (Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and the Island of Misfit Toys is a 2001 American-Canadian Christmas computer-animated adventure musical film directed by Bill Kowalchuk for GoodTimes Entertainment. It was released on VHS and DVD on October 30, 2001.[1] The film takes place after the events of the original special (despite Rudolph and …)
[13:03:53] <enterprisey> /a/ is as strong as ever if you have a good filter list and ignore most of the board
[13:04:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Rudolph, not satisfied with being a "novelty act" performing tricks with his nose, travels with Hermey [an elf who, since his appearance in the previous movie, has taken up dentistry] to the Island of Misfit Toys to give King Moonracer a root canal dental treatment."
[13:05:52] <enterprisey> the original was good
[13:05:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> Wow the villain of this movie is a teddy bear who was thrown away by the kid he belonged to, so he became a supervillain called the Toy Taker and tried to enact a plan to take all toys away from all children forever
[13:06:49] <PapuaHardyNet> wait, which movie are we talking about?
[13:07:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> There is clearly *tons* of fanfic material here! Not even counting the obvious hooks in the original story!

[13:08:40] <enterprisey> perhaps 5% of /g/ is worthwhile to read but the trick is finding the 5%. not worth the effort most of the time

[15:14:48] *** Joins: gproto23 (~gproto23@user/gproto23)
[15:15:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> But what happens when you combine superglobals with variable variables? Well it turns out that it's kind of like putting a portable hole in a bag of holding
[15:16:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> $Bar = "a"; $Foo = "Bar"; $World = "Foo"; $Hello = "World"; $a = "Hello";
[15:17:12] <PapuaHardyNet> a portable hole in a bag of holding? sounds like a recipe for a segfault
[15:17:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> echo "$a $$a $$$a $$$$a $$$$$a $$$$$$a $$$$$$$a"; // prints "Hello World Foo Bar a Hello World"
[15:17:32] <PapuaHardyNet> wth
[15:20:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> Really just read the "variable variables" manual page I linked, scroll down to the comments
[15:21:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> The comment that starts with "These are the scenarios that you may run into trying to reference superglobals dynamically" is particularly wtf
[15:22:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or how about this one:
[15:22:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> "For a particular reason I had been using some variable names with hyphens for ages. There was no problem because they were only referenced via a variable variable. I only saw a parse error much later, when I tried to reference one directly. It took a while to realise that illegal hyphens were the cause because the parse error only occurs on assignment."
[15:23:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> This one is good too:
[15:23:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> "While not relevant in everyday PHP programming, it seems to be possible to insert whitespace and comments between the dollar signs of a variable variable.  All three comment styles work. This information becomes relevant when writing a parser, tokenizer or something else that operates on PHP syntax."
[15:23:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> i.e. you can do this:
[15:23:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> $foo = 'bar';
[15:24:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> $    /* comment here lol */        $foo = 'magic';
[15:24:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> echo $bar;
[15:24:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> And it will print "magic"
[15:24:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> You can do this across lines, etc.
[15:24:56] <nshepperd2> what the hell
[15:25:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> You can even use functions! Like this:
[15:26:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> ${date("M")} = "Worked";
[15:26:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> echo ${date("M")};
[15:26:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> i.e., declare a variable whose name is the output of the function call `date("M")`
[15:26:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> PHP!!! :D
[15:27:47] <PapuaHardyNet> this reminds me of lisp in some ways
[15:27:54] <nshepperd2> never before has a variable wanted more... variableness
[15:27:58] <PapuaHardyNet> something about metaprogramming
[15:29:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> Now, you might think: is there any limit to this wizardry?? This comment throws some cold water on our excitement:
[15:29:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Variable variables techniques do not work when one of the "variables" is a constant.  The example below illustrates this.  This is probably the desired behavior for constants, but was confusing for me when I was trying to figure it out.  The alternative I used was to add the variables I needed to the $GLOBALS array instead of defining them as constants. "

[15:30:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> (variable constants, lol. Just ponder this phrase)
[15:30:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> nshepperd2: Wow, that is *very* artstation
[15:32:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway, back to globals:
[15:32:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> " You may notice that this is a little bit different from the C language in that global variables in C are automatically available to functions unless specifically overridden by a local definition. This can cause some problems in that people may inadvertently change a global variable. In PHP global variables must be declared global inside a function if they are going to be used in that function."

[17:16:51] <two2thehead> "Several labs have indicated that for one widely used PCR test, one of the three target genes is not detected (called S gene dropout or S gene target failure) and this test can therefore be used as marker for this variant, pending sequencing confirmation"
[17:16:53] <two2thehead> yeah
[17:17:05] <kuudes> on omicron it is the other way than in delta, so it can be detected to some extent with the s-gene test
[17:17:17] <kuudes> which is what some countries do for most or all positive test results
[17:17:35] <kuudes> but there is also omicron version which has s gene the same way as delta, so it won't catch those

[17:39:25] <Robomot> Omicron could become dominant in some European countries by next week, officials predict - The Washington Post (Questions about vaccine protection and disease severity remain open.)
[17:39:46] <kuudes> "European leaders and scientists warned Friday that the omicron variant could become dominant in some countries startlingly soon, overtaking the delta variant, which has remained the most common version of the virus globally for months. “We expect it to overtake delta within days, not weeks,” Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister of Scotland, said Friday about the spread of omicron there."
[17:39:53] <kuudes> "In Denmark, too, omicron on its current trajectory could become dominant by “the end of next week,” said Mads Albertsen, a professor at Aalborg University."
[17:40:02] <kuudes> "The sense is that Britain and Denmark aren’t standouts. Rather, they are tracking and modeling the spread especially carefully, and what they’re reporting may reflect what’s emerging elsewhere in Europe. And since so often during the pandemic Europe has served as a preview of what’s to come in the United States, U.S. officials are watching closely, as well."

[17:58:21] <PapuaHardyNet> okay, for some reason, using optax's implementation of softmax cross entropy doesn't throw the error that my implementation of softmax cross entropy does (the average throwing neginf values was part of my implementation of softmax cross entropy)
[17:58:52] <PapuaHardyNet> i'm tempted to simply replace my code with the optax implementation but I really want to know how the hell an average operation would generate neginf values
[18:06:53] <PapuaHardyNet> okay, I am dumb, I didn't remember that argmax returns the index and not the value
[18:07:45] <PapuaHardyNet> but that doesn't change the fact that while X has -inf values, jnp.isneginf doesn't detect it
[18:08:02] <PapuaHardyNet> jnp.isneginf does detect it in jnp.average(X) though

[18:40:54] <nshepperd2> of course  jnp.all(jnp.isneginf(log_softmax)) will return false
[18:41:04] <nshepperd2> some of the things aren't infinity
[18:42:29] <PapuaHardyNet> that's horrifying, I thought jnp.all returns a True for at least one True
[18:42:51] <PapuaHardyNet> what should I use to get such data then?
[18:43:02] <nshepperd2> all is logical-and
[18:43:07] <nshepperd2> any is logical-or
[18:43:16] <PapuaHardyNet> I see, I'll keep that in mind
[18:44:35] <PapuaHardyNet> oh yeah, and the real problem was that my log_softmax had -inf values then?
[18:45:56] <dv2> galambo, o_O
[18:46:13] <PapuaHardyNet> the strange part is that I would get nan values when doing a jnp.average(log_softmax, weights=labels) *for only one specific example*. But I've replaced my implementation with the optax implementation so whatever I guess
[18:48:40] <nshepperd2> idk
[18:49:12] <nshepperd2> -inf is not necessarily a problem
[18:49:30] <nshepperd2> but you probably shouldn't be getting -inf during normal training
[18:50:07] <nshepperd2> like, -inf for the predictions means the nn is certain that label will never come up
[18:50:30] <nshepperd2> for the prediction for a specific label
[18:50:46] <nshepperd2> so if you are, something is probably wrong
[18:51:15] <PapuaHardyNet> right, I think it has to be a problem with the implementation although it was literally a log(softmax(logits)) smh
[18:51:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> "I am SURE that this doesn't work properly." —comment in this library's code
[18:52:02] <nshepperd2> for instance, the loss function (thing to minimize) is actually -log_softmax(logits)
[18:52:53] <nshepperd2> if you used log_softmax(logits) as the loss function it will try to maximize the loss and diverge
[18:53:57] <PapuaHardyNet> oh. I didn't uh, I didn't do a minus 
[18:54:05] <PapuaHardyNet> let me check whether the loss was maximizing
[18:55:07] <PapuaHardyNet> okay, so the loss is negative, and getting more negative. However, it is still maximizing, based on what you say
[18:55:21] <nshepperd2> the loss should be positive
[18:55:27] <PapuaHardyNet> because you are still doing a gradient descent, yes, except your loss function you are doing a gradient descent on is incorrect
[18:55:30] <nshepperd2> and going toward 0
[18:55:35] <kuudes> dv2, it is satire site
[18:56:19] <kuudes> PapuaHardyNet, so, your model has been driving itself away from optimum?
[18:56:34] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah, you have no idea how embarrassing htat is
[18:56:36] <kuudes> I guess that could easily explain fringe values such as inf
[18:56:39] <nshepperd2> it has been trying to make its predictions maximally wrong

[22:48:05] <pompolic> two2thehead: did you know that you _can_ in fact create files with colons on them on NTFS file systems? linux doesn't care
[22:48:37] <two2thehead> hm TIL
[22:48:41] <pompolic> it could be that the input validation is similarly bypassable
[22:49:00] <pompolic> just nobody bothered to edit a SAM database before
[22:49:51] <two2thehead> "The Security Account Manager (SAM) is a database file in Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, 8.1 and 10 that stores users' passwords. It can be used to authenticate local and remote users. ... SAM uses cryptographic measures to prevent unauthenticated users accessing the system."
[22:50:11] <pompolic> well, i assume it also stores the usernames themselves but i could be wrong
[22:50:26] <pompolic> it's more or less /etc/passwd+/etc/shadow for windows
[22:50:35] <two2thehead> I would *hope* microsoft has done input validation/database entry sanitation by now O_O
[22:50:45] <pompolic> that's not the point
[22:51:03] <pompolic> the point is what happens if someone edits the database to include invalid characters anyway
[22:51:28] <two2thehead> ah, post-facto file editing
[22:51:33] <pompolic> exactly
[22:51:39] <two2thehead> could work, I don't know enough to say
[22:51:44] <pompolic> me either
[22:51:58] <pompolic> i never tried
[22:52:02] <two2thehead> don't worry, we won't let that stop us from speculating wildly :V
[22:52:25] <pompolic> too busy injecting invalid characters elsewhere, as far as security research goes

[23:02:10] <gwern> rmmh: well so far the linear scan loop approach does tamp down massively on memory use. speed at n=500 is ok, still working on seeing how fast it is at n=5500... I hate using folds to imitate loops, I find them hard to understand

[23:23:08] <linear> there may be enough touhou midi data that you could get some pretty impressive stuff using that level instead of waveforms 
[23:26:11] <gwern> MIDI? I doubt that. people don't distribute MIDI, just CDs
[23:26:30] <gwern> you can finetune on the 50k tracks of the TLMC, but that's all lossless
[23:30:17] <linear> not normally, but for piano/guitar there's definitely a bit available, you'd still want a ton of pre-training on other things of course
[23:30:33] <linear> I guess we are starting to get pretty good at waveform->midi too though, but still some work to go
[23:30:55] <linear> which, given I think I have like 1TB of touhou music, would surely trivialize it
[23:31:37] <gwern> it'd make more sense to just jointly train on all real+midi and then condition
[23:32:02] <gwern> if you dump real->midi, you aren't actually adding any information. just subtracting and probably adding in biases
