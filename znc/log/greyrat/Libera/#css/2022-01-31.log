[01:38:14] <Stinger> i.e. if I want an instant transition when a element increases its size and then a slower decay if it reduces

[11:04:19] <Stinger> those numbers can be clipped (for now)
[11:05:24] <FunkyBob> what do you mean "following the mouse cursor"?
[11:05:54] <Stinger> well I mean the numbers change depending on the mouse position (it is a legend for a plot)
[11:07:03] <FunkyBob> I see
[11:09:27] <FunkyBob> have you got a sample?

[11:14:50] <FunkyBob> also, am trying to make sure it's a table you really need

[18:27:05] <[twisti]> can svg not paint subtractive somehow ?
[18:28:17] *** Joins: georgios (~georgios@user/georgios)
[18:32:17] <pavonia> What do you mean exactly?
[18:33:02] <[twisti]> well, normal painting just replaces the color below it
[18:33:11] <[twisti]> but i need to paint in a way the subtracts the color
[18:33:24] <[twisti]> so black stays black, but white becomes the color i paint, and the rest is mixed
[18:34:30] <pavonia> You can define custom color composition methods, I think
[18:35:14] <pavonia> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/feComposite
[18:35:22] <pavonia> The arithmetic filter
[18:35:44] <[twisti]> ill read up on that, thanks
[18:36:30] <[twisti]> at first glance that looks exactly like that i need

[23:09:48] <Henry151> hmm... well just deleting the ontouchstart="this.classList.toggle('hover');" from each div seems to get rid of the errors and not cause any change in the behavior of the site
[23:10:08] <Henry151> i thought they were necessary for the card-flipping animation to work.
[23:13:09] <Henry151> so, instead, i'm back to my issue from yesterday which is still plagueing me... https://eponafarms.org the font, which is a .ttf file, is not loading on Chrome on my android device. Can't for the life of me figure out why.
