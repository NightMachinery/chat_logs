[04:29:37] <johncs> I wasn’t particularly jazzed for the two finger swipe gesture, even though I implemented it. Just didn’t seem that useful… but I just got a tablet and I got say the gesture is pretty convenient for this case
[04:31:27] <johncs> Also I’m impressed the gesture for showing and  hiding the  sidebar works when the sidebar isn’t floating. Whoever implemented that did a great job

[12:42:40] <bookworm> Gofuy: just saying hi I'm the guy from the issue would've done the trick ;)
[12:44:05] <Gofuy> lol
[12:44:28] <Gofuy> thanks your reply.
[12:44:39] <bookworm> what did you mean by >Without fish or Crypt, TL also never gets a message bac
[12:45:54] <bookworm> As far as your debug output is concerned, TL acts exactly as expected
[12:46:50] <Gofuy> From the debug log, those 3 situations has no different: 1.ZNC+fish 2.ZNC+crypt 3.ZNC only
[12:47:32] <Gofuy> The same output " PRIVMSG #thelounge test"
[12:48:39] <bookworm> no, the incoming part. The green left arrow is what TL sends, the >> is incoming from the server
[12:50:09] <bookworm> TL uses a cap called echo-message, meaning whatever it sends out comes back in after a server roundtrip
[12:51:32] <bookworm> if the message doesn't show up in the raw output that's either something fishy with irc-framework (you could enable debug for that too and check if something is obvious) or it never gets sent from znc to TL
[12:52:06] <bookworm> crypt doesn't seem to decrypt the self message, and fish doesn't reply at all
[12:55:16] <H4ndy> Does "Clear history" actually remove stuff from the sqlite db?
[12:56:54] <bookworm> yes and no
[12:57:13] <bookworm> yes it marks stuff as deleted, no sqlite won't give the storage back to the OS
[12:57:24] <bookworm> you need to run a VACUUM
[12:57:34] <H4ndy> Yeah that's fine, I just wanted to make sure it's actually removing data for itself
[12:57:44] <bookworm> (note this temporary needs like twice the disc space)

[12:58:14] <bookworm> much wow
[12:58:42] <fnutt> Will that work with IRCCloud?
[12:58:50] <bookworm> depends
[12:58:51] <johncs> yes, was using irc cloud to test initially
[12:58:54] <bookworm> not on libera
[12:58:56] <fnutt> If I remember correctly they support reactions.
[12:59:01] <H4ndy> is this actual IRC spec?
[12:59:04] <fnutt> Yes
[12:59:04] <bookworm> yes
[12:59:09] <johncs> yes, ircv3 reactions spec
[12:59:11] <H4ndy> oh gawd
[12:59:16] <fnutt> https://ircv3.net/specs/client-tags/react.html
[12:59:18] <johncs> libera doesn't support message tags at all yet
[12:59:59] <Gofuy> 1.ZNC+fish: there is no the incoming part.
[12:59:59] <Gofuy> 2.ZNC+crypt: the incoming part shows "*** @time=2021-10-29T08:18:05.343Z :Motoy!~Motoy@2001:bc8::g PRIVMSG #thelounge :+OK *5SxEIqCTuSC15cdChb5eEA=="
[12:59:59] <Gofuy> 3.ZNC only the incoming part shows "*** @time=2021-10-29T08:21:11.987Z :Motoy!~Motoy@2001:bc8::g PRIVMSG #thelounge test"
[12:59:59] <Gofuy> I don't know how to describe it correctly, maybe you will find the problem if you install a znc yourself. thanks bookworm
[13:00:19] <fnutt> --> https://www.hastebin.com
[13:00:29] <johncs> does irc cloud reactions work on libera bookworm?
[13:00:40] <bookworm> Gofuy: the last line you pasted *is* the incoming part
[13:00:44] <fnutt> I assume no, johncs.
[13:00:52] <fnutt> The ircd does not support it.
[13:00:53] <johncs> i'd assume no too, but the way he said that makes me wonder
[13:00:56] <johncs> it's not like it'd be impossible
[13:01:26] <Gofuy> bookworm, ZNC+fish plugin has no the incoming part, the other 2 have.
[13:01:44] <fnutt> https://github.com/Libera-Chat/solanum
[13:01:47] <bookworm> yes, hence me saying troubleshoot the znc side
[13:02:16] <Gofuy> 😢
[13:02:28] <Gofuy> :(
[13:02:38] <johncs> just tested it: irc cloud does not support reactions on libera. i would've been very intrigued if they did
[13:03:42] <fnutt> I hope InspIRCd will support it soon. (TM)
[13:03:46] <bookworm> how could they without a message ID?
[13:04:24] <johncs> i was imagining some irc cloud only feature, where they're talking to one of their own servers
[13:04:42] <johncs> managing message ids and such that only apply to messages sent through irccloud
[13:05:01] <johncs> 🤷‍♀️ not that it would be practical, but it doesn't seem impossible
[13:05:55] <bookworm> ah yeah... could also synthesize a hash over nick+host+time+msg plus some ID but it's... not so great
[13:06:13] <Gofuy> thanks bookworm. but ZNC works well with all other IRC Clients, no extra setting is needed. In fact, I don’t know how to tune the ZNC settings.
[13:06:36] <fnutt> Why use ZNC? ;p
[13:06:43] <fnutt> It complicates stuff.
[13:06:48] <bookworm> because it has nice features
[13:06:55] <fnutt> Especially when you are encrypting messages and whatnot.
[13:07:05] <Gofuy> ZNC has a lot of plugins
[13:11:36] <LitBot> [03GitHub] (14thelounge/thelounge) [issue] brunnre8 closed 13#4346: Playback issues with ZNC blowfish plugins - https://git.io/JPcn1
[13:12:55] <Gofuy> 😥
[13:15:44] <bookworm> you need to teach crypt to do what it says on the tin, it doesn't Gofuy but that's up to the module authors. Fish as well but that's even outside of the core znc
[13:18:07] <Gofuy> When TL support the encrypting, maybe I would give up the ZNC
[13:18:17] <Gofuy> https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/issues/4016#issuecomment-669027780
[13:18:40] <fnutt> My guess is that it will not happen any time soon.
[13:18:44] <Gofuy> xPaw said “Blowfish is outdated and not something we will have in TL core. There's been some discussions about E2E encryption in ircv3 but nothing concrete yet.“
[13:18:48] <fnutt> Not many has asked about this in the channel.
[13:19:52] <fnutt> Also it depends on someone implementing it. I assume it has to be a plugin. The Lounge does not have enough plugins support for this to happen now.
[13:20:05] <fnutt> Ergo it will take time before it might happen.
[13:20:07] <Gofuy> A really sad news.
[13:21:31] <petteri> johncs: you could log into the ergo network. They support these new features and for example the link resolver always replies the link as a reply to the orginal message
[13:21:50] <petteri> https://ergo.chat/about-network
[13:22:08] <johncs> petteri: haha way ahead of you, that was a screenshot of the lounge connected to ergo
[13:22:37] <johncs> maybe I didn't make it clear, but those were actual reactions implemented in the lounge
[13:22:50] <petteri> ah, ok :)
[13:23:39] <johncs> Gofuy: I think xPaw was talking about implementing what ZNC-fish does within TL. But you may be able to get ZNC working still.
[13:23:50] <johncs> I suspect one of the problems is that ZNC might not be echoing your messages back to you.
[13:24:19] <fnutt> xPaw is not around anymore though.
[13:24:38] <bookworm> he is ;)
[13:24:45] <fnutt> Where?
[13:25:05] <Gofuy> johncs: I do not konw the details, but ZNC would echo messages back to HexChat and mIRC.
[13:25:07] <fnutt> In his Steampowered channels? Sure
[13:25:23] *** Quits: adia (~adia@comix.gr) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[13:25:31] <johncs> Gofuy: It may not be doing that... Many other clients don't rely on echo messages like the lounge
[13:25:35] *** Joins: adia (~adia@comix.gr)
[13:25:43] <johncs> It's a relatively new IRC feature: the server send the message you just sent back to you
[13:26:05] <johncs> The Lounge won't even display the message you sent until the server does that
[13:26:13] <johncs> I think most other clients will just display the message immediately
[13:26:17] <johncs> That could explain the discrepency
[13:26:25] <Gofuy> Maybe
[13:26:37] <bookworm> (likely)
[13:26:53] <Gofuy> Sounds reasonable
[13:27:10] <johncs> I think you could disable the echo message cap on ZNC. The lounge probably has some fallback.
[13:27:17] <bookworm> yep
[13:27:54] <bookworm> not sure it listens to the config change after connect though
[13:29:05] <Gofuy> disable the echo message cap on ZNC, I will have a try if ZNC support the feature.
[13:29:47] <johncs> Oh hey, look at that: https://github.com/znc/znc/issues/1481
[13:29:54] <johncs> And also: https://github.com/znc/znc/issues/1629
[13:32:07] <Gofuy> Damn.
[13:32:32] <Gofuy> opened this issue on 3 Jan 2018 
[13:33:00] <Gofuy> 3 years has gone, the bug still.
[13:33:23] <johncs> that first one's been fixed
[13:33:29] <johncs> i'm guessing you're running an old znc
[13:33:50] <Gofuy> nope, I run the latest ZNC 1.8.2
[13:34:44] <johncs> Oh damn, DarthGandalf sure thinks they fixed it 🤷‍♀️
[13:35:26] <Jay2k1> > I think most other clients will just display the message immediately <-- i think mattermost (not irc) will display a sent message in grey until it got confirmation that it has been ack'd by the server, then it will turn black (or white on dark theme)
[13:35:33] <gopher2227> Hello. Just got my thelounge sticket pack. Thank you! :)
[13:35:48] <Jay2k1> does it still come with a fridge magnet?
[13:36:41] <johncs> I'd like to make a PR to do that at some point... Though I think it's still wishy-washy trying to match up the echo message with the message you sent so maybe not 🤷‍♀️
[13:36:44] <gopher2227> Yes! Also some of those that you can iron on a t-sirt (I think)
[13:37:52] <bookworm> heh, TL would even fallback gracefully if you disable the cap ad hoc: https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/blob/0fb6dae8a68627cd7747ea6164ebe93390fe90f2/src/plugins/inputs/msg.js#L94
[13:38:44] <Jay2k1> it certainly is confusing when you have a network issue and send a message and don't see it after hitting enter
[13:39:55] <bookworm> well, tells you that you have a network issue
[13:40:57] <bookworm> on the plus side, if you see the message you know the server received it
[13:40:57] <Jay2k1> tell me i have a network issue without telling me i have a network issue
[13:41:05] <Jay2k1> yeah but you have to know that ;)
[13:41:42] <johncs> Here’s the spec that makes it easy to implement that robustly: https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/labeled-response
[13:42:58] <johncs> No libera support of course 🥲

[13:54:39] <bookworm> ZNC fixed it for the crypt module (the first bug linked), it works. They are also spec compliant by sending you the encrypted form. It's just not very useful
[13:55:11] <bookworm> fish is a third party module and outside of core, meaning you'd need to bug those to fix it, not on the znc issue tracker

[13:57:20] <bookworm> that's the spec compliant part
[13:58:05] <bookworm> one could argue that it would be better to break the spec here, alas that usually leads to poor interoperability
[14:05:25] <Gofuy> Let's wait some E2E encryption in ircv3 for years.
[14:06:58] <bookworm> probably not worth it considering the normal use case of IRC pf being a public group chat
