[03:05:07] <PaulWay[w]> Morning all!
[03:05:30] <PaulWay[w]> I'm querying a JSON field using the Postgres extensions in Django.
[03:06:04] <PaulWay[w]> So I can do something like `Host.objects.filter(system_profile__host_type="edge")` and get a list of 'edge' hosts.
[03:07:04] <PaulWay[w]> But the reverse doesn't seem to work - `Host.objects.exclude(system_profile__host_type="edge")` returns no rows.
[03:07:31] <PaulWay[w]> I think it's because the 'host_type' field is only set on some hosts (usually edge ones, not sure of data set ATM).
[03:09:40] <PaulWay[w]> I think it needs a different Postgres JSON operator?
[03:14:15] *** Quits: bitdex (~bitdex@gateway/tor-sasl/bitdex) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[03:16:29] <PaulWay[w]> I think what I want is the '@>' operator - can I say `Host.objects.exclude(system_profile__contains={'host_type': 'edge'})`?
[03:16:39] <PaulWay[w]> *shrugs* let's try it, Paul.

[06:54:05] <Guest80> Ok figured that one out.. now I am wondering about this error https://dpaste.org/9QQM
[06:55:14] <FunkyBob> Guest80: looks like somehow it's got a Response where it expects a Request
[06:55:31] <Guest80> i see
[06:55:48] <Guest80> So I guess I would need to use factory?
[06:56:17] <FunkyBob> which line of the test is erroring?
[06:56:26] <Guest80>         self.middleware.__call__(response)
[06:56:31] <FunkyBob> I see it now
[06:56:56] <FunkyBob> yeah, it should be a request passed to the middleware, and it yields a response
[06:57:14] <FunkyBob> have you looked at how django tests its own middlewares?
[06:57:39] <Guest80> ah ok i will see if i can change it. No that would be useful to look at
[06:58:52] *** Quits: xkuru (~xkuru@user/xkuru) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[06:59:58] <Guest80> ooh i think it worked after changing to use requestfactory
[07:01:07] <Guest80> Oh wait nevermind.
[07:01:19] <Guest80> I get no test errors but the optional cookie still remains
[07:01:43] <Guest80> The optional cookie should disappear if calling the middleware after deleting the cookie_consent cookie
[07:02:28] <Guest80> Set-Cookie: optional_test_cookie="optional cookie set from django"; Path=/
[07:02:41] <Guest80> Maybe because the cookie is a session cookie and is missing a domain?
[07:02:43] <FunkyBob> yes, that's how you delete a cookie... Set it with an expired time
[07:03:22] <Guest80> oh let me see what it looks like at the beginning. What I just showed you is what it looks like at the end
[07:03:28] <Guest80> after the middleware runs
[07:04:42] <FunkyBob> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie#max-agenumber
[07:04:46] <Guest80> Nah it is the same at the beginning and the end
[07:05:09] <Guest80> Yes I know of that max_agee
[07:05:24] <FunkyBob> specificallyt the point about 0 or negative values?
[07:06:22] <Guest80> Yes I tried that earlier with no avail. I had to use del instead
[07:06:58] <FunkyBob> perhaps I misunderstood the problem you were addressing
[07:07:03] <FunkyBob> what do you need the del for?
[07:07:06] <Guest80> But this time what should happen is if deleting the cookie_consent cookie then running the middleware optional_test_cookie should be completely gone
[07:07:26] <Guest80> To stimulate the browser deletion of cookie_consent
[07:07:32] <Guest80> simulate*
[07:13:15] <Guest80> This is the current code where tests pass but optional cookie still remains. https://dpaste.org/DR20
[07:13:33] <Guest80> So close to being done yet so far lol
[07:17:03] <Guest80> I don't think it has anything to do with the middleware actually in the django settings? It seems to run as we have just done through the previous error troubleshooting
[07:17:22] <Guest80> Since we are testing only
[07:18:58] <Guest80> oh wait I may be wrong... I just added it to settings and am getting something different now
[07:20:03] <Guest80> I think it works now
[07:20:29] <Guest80> https://dpaste.org/1Tdh
[07:20:43] <Guest80> It cannot find the optional cookie and max age is now 0
[07:21:11] <Guest80> Awesome I love you funkybob <3
[07:21:27] * FunkyBob blushes
[07:21:52] <Guest80> haha you rock
[07:22:09] <Guest80> I have another question though about this library but it is more of a understanding what this person means in the comment
[07:22:49] <Guest80> Btw this is great now that this works I will make the PR and I think this library will be better than all paid GDPR ones
[07:23:00] <Guest80> All because of this middleware :)
[07:23:10] <Guest80> https://github.com/bmihelac/django-cookie-consent/issues/49
[07:23:15] <Guest80> I am trying to understand this issue
[07:23:39] <Guest80> I am not sure if they mean all of the django cache or cache like from squid3?

[07:42:11] <Guest80> if not, then no worries. All I can do with that one is probably just try fixing the template tag. The JS is out of my wheelhouse

There is only one time i call django to load the index.html where i initialize the SPA..then the subsequential requests will be made to the endpoints. For POST, PUT methods i should pass the CRSF token in the headers, django store it in cookies so i can read it and put inside the headers...
[17:22:35] <pycode1> but is this method sustainable for subsequent requests? I Mean, if django invalidate a previous the previous token for some reason...so what can i do?

[18:04:34] <juangh> I have two model class. One called "documents" and other "names". In document i have the textarea.
[18:05:26] <juangh> In that textarea i write something like: "My name is {{ name }}"
[18:06:21] <pycode1> hello moldy pardon for a direct question to you but i am quite disperated... could a crsf token be changed during the user session?  i mean if the user do many POST called django canges it?
[18:06:25] <pycode1> canges = changes
[18:06:46] <juangh> In the view i filter from both model class, that document and one name...in context i called it as "d" for document and "n" for name.
[18:06:56] <moldy> pycode1: i'm not sure, but it shouldn't matter
[18:07:01] <juangh> it pass to the template...
[18:07:24] <juangh> but, the situation: the var "d" is showed perfect...but.
[18:07:29] <moldy> pycode1: at least not with the default csrf mechanism
[18:07:36] <pycode1> moldy, eeeh in my case it matters a lot, i call  view just one time... for the index.html where i load my SPA...then i use the rest framework (endpoints)
[18:07:48] <pycode1> so i wonder what happen if django changes it
[18:07:57] <moldy> pycode1: django doesn't have the token
[18:07:58] <juangh> "my name is {{n }}"
[18:08:12] <pycode1> moldy, uh ? django creates a cookie with the token
[18:08:21] <moldy> pycode1: yeah but it doesn't keep the token
[18:08:42] <pycode1> and then i load it from js and then pass it via headers..
[18:08:43] <pycode1> yes
[18:08:48] <juangh> but, where should be showed the name "n" it doesn't work...it is not showed.
[18:08:49] <pycode1> but i mean...what if django change it
[18:09:09] <pycode1> how can i get the new crsf token for the next POST/PUT calls
[18:09:09] <moldy> django cannot change the token
[18:09:17] <moldy> django does not keep the token
[18:09:38] <moldy> django just sends a random value to the browser and then forgets it
[18:09:39] <pycode1> moldy, why not? i mean...django creates that token, so why django cannot invalidate (update it with a new token)
[18:09:40] <pycode1> ?
[18:09:47] <moldy> pycode1: see above
[18:10:10] <moldy> pycode1: the browser has the token, twice (cookie plus form field). it sends it twice per request (cookie / header plus form field). as long as the two values match, it will succeed
[18:10:32] <moldy> django compares the two tokens the browser sends, it doesn't compare against anything stored on django's side
[18:13:14] <pycode1> moldy, yes ok, but what i am saying is that django creates the cookie with the csrf token.. then i need to get that token and put it in headers.. so what i am saying is...i get the crsf in the cookies and tehn use it in the headers (when i call my endpoints). But as i said when i call and endpoint i just get the json not other cookies
[18:13:40] <pycode1> so for the next call how can i get the csrf from cookie? as i said the first time when i load the index.html i can see the crsf token
[18:14:07] <pycode1> but for the next calls? what about if it...expires or something else?
[18:15:41] <moldy> it doesn't expire
[18:15:48] <moldy> again: django does not keep the token
[18:16:25] <moldy> you can send "foo" as the token. as long as you send it in both places, that's fine with django (but don't do that since it's guessable, use a random value)

[20:05:48] <MerrinX> But what are those ID`s I am receiving? and why is it claming it is not valid
[20:06:00] <GinFuyou> brand ids
[20:06:39] <MerrinX> it is not brand id`s, or same ids as if I go inn on one of the brands on admin page, then the id is different
[20:06:41] <GinFuyou> Do you have brands with ids like this? Code you have implies you have, otherwise why brand.id will output something else
[20:07:24] <GinFuyou> well, what exactly html code you have for your <form> now?
[20:07:46] <MerrinX> on the html?
[20:07:49] <GinFuyou> yes

[20:13:53] <GinFuyou> that's why you get product's ids there
[20:14:22] <MerrinX> should i change to brand class?
[20:14:39] <GinFuyou> well, I'm not sure what you meant by that line
[20:14:48] <GinFuyou> but at least it shouldn't be called brands
[20:15:23] <GinFuyou> if you need it, query all brands separately
[20:15:44] <MerrinX> brand = Brand.objects.all() ?
[20:16:29] <GinFuyou> perfecrly form should take care of it, but for a quick test, yeah. excepts "brands"
[20:16:39] <GinFuyou> or brand_queryset if you prefer
[20:17:00] <GinFuyou> var name should hint what kind of object it is
[20:23:04] <MerrinX> now I changed to brand_queryset = Brand.objects.all() and now it returns nothing, all the brands are there but when I choose one, it give nothing
[20:25:20] <MerrinX> but if I use the Brand class now, then the form is for the Product, ... how will this be
[20:25:27] <GinFuyou> have you changed template code? to `for brand in brand_queryset` and pass brand_queryset into context
[20:26:04] <MerrinX> will update godbolt
[20:26:08] <GinFuyou> MerrinX, well, I didn't supposed form to be for product... but it still should work, at least for single choice
[20:28:10] <MerrinX> https://godbolt.org/z/P35G5caE9
[20:28:13] <MerrinX> there you go
[20:29:40] <MerrinX> ok and i changed name="brand_queryset" and now it gives the correct brand id but still returning error
[20:30:11] <MerrinX> the error now is "this field is required"
[20:30:17] <MerrinX> strange, what field?
[20:31:46] <MerrinX> does he expect all fields for ALL brands to be checked?
[20:31:47] <GinFuyou> I didn't tell to change name attribut =)
[20:32:00] <MerrinX> but I did and now it works?
[20:32:08] <MerrinX> or atleast give correct id
[20:32:21] <GinFuyou> yes, but it doesn't match form field
[20:33:05] <GinFuyou> as I said input name must match field name. If you form still has it as brand (which is picked automatically from Meta.fields) - input name must be brand

[20:34:26] <MerrinX> when I change back input field to just brand it returns nothing
[20:35:55] <pj3000> I'm migrating from sqlite3 to postgresql. Using manage.py dumpdata I was able to serialize my database but the file is very large, 800MB. So I split it into multiple 1MB files and I want to load my new postgresql database using this code: https://dpaste.org/v3KV but the many-to-many relationships are not transferred over to postgresql... everything
[20:35:56] <pj3000> else is. How can I include M2M relations in this?
[20:36:03] <GinFuyou> what you mean exactly by "returns" input name only affect key with which data is submitted
[20:38:08] <MerrinX> ok when I had input name="brand_queryset" same as in view, then it returns the query with correct ID for the brand, but still give form not valid, and it complains that fields need to be selected. But when i change back to name="brand" then I get nothing when i choose a checkbox and submit

[20:39:17] <MerrinX> You are 100% correct
[20:39:29] <MerrinX> i just did not print if form was valid the request
[20:41:36] <MerrinX> GinFuyou: Thank you very much for your help and patience
[20:43:39] <GinFuyou> MerrinX, I'd remade form in simple forms.Form with brand = ModelMultipleSelectField(Brand) to work with multiple select
[20:43:59] <MerrinX> Ok, thank you I will try :)
[20:47:29] <pj3000> is there a faster way to load fixtures into a new database other than using manage.py loaddata?
[20:47:47] *** Joins: djapo (~archangel@user/djapo)
[20:48:38] <GinFuyou> pj3000, could try some specialized tool like DBeaver
[20:48:55] <GinFuyou> (haven't used it myself, just read refferences to it)
[20:49:18] <GinFuyou> fixtures are fundamentally slow and problematic I believe
[20:49:33] <pj3000> thanks, I was trying to do it without a tool, I managed to get this code to work: https://dpaste.org/v3KV
[20:49:36] <dodo> and hard to maintain
[20:49:58] <pj3000> it significantly speeds up the process, cuts it from ~4 hours with loaddata down to about 10 minutes
[20:50:04] <pj3000> but the issue is the many to many relationships
[20:50:16] <dodo> pj3000: fwiw, you could just use sql dumps?
[20:50:44] <pj3000> once I deserialize the json file, the many to many fields are returning null, and I'm not sure why/how to change this.
[20:51:21] <pj3000> I'm just deserializing the file generated by dumpdata, and I can see in the json that the many to many relations are represented as a list
[20:51:56] <MerrinX> GinFuyou: I got one last question, for today :D If you are up for it. https://godbolt.org/z/zvsr5j168
[20:52:10] <MerrinX> line 32
[20:53:09] <pj3000> dodo could you elaborate on sql dumps? Meaning create a sql dump on sqlite3 and load that into postgresql?
[20:54:19] <pj3000> would this retain all relations and keep same PK values for the objects?
