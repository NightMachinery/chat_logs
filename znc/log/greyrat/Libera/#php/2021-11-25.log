[01:14:11] <__adrian> ThePhilgrim: why would you be parsing the request body? $_POSR does populate from multipart/form-data.
[01:14:33] <__adrian> * $_POST
[01:15:16] <__adrian> the fact that it came from a js formdata object doesn't change anything.
[01:20:09] <ThePhilgrim> __adrian: I have no idea what I'm doing so there might be a lot of misunderstandings in what I'm saying

[01:20:41] <ThePhilgrim> I currently hav ea FormData object with name and email in it
[01:20:52] <ThePhilgrim> And I would like for my PHP to just dump the name
[01:21:01] <ThePhilgrim> so I know how to access specific parts of the FormData object
[01:22:38] <__adrian> the formdata object exists in javascript. it does not exist in php at all.
[01:23:02] <__adrian> formdata sends data as multipart/form-data. php automatically populates $_POST from that. there's no parsing involved.
[01:23:13] <__adrian> https://php.net/_POST
[01:23:17] <noord> ThePhilgrim: echo "<pre>"; print_r($_POST)
[01:23:25] <ThePhilgrim> So if I have a html form with name and email, and I send it to server side with fetch API, how do I access "name" in PHP?
[01:23:34] <__adrian> ^ though note, do not just print user input  ;)
[01:23:54] <__adrian> "ThePhilgrim> how do I access "name""  // https://php.net/_POST
[01:24:08] <__adrian> $_POST is an array, just like any other.
[01:24:29] <noord> ThePhilgrim: do it precautiously
[01:25:06] <__adrian> if you don't understand how to access values in arrays, https::/php.net/array
[01:25:15] <ThePhilgrim> I plan to use PHPMailer, because I want to get the data to my e-mail. Now I'm just experimenting locally to understand what I'm doing
[01:25:35] <__adrian> that's a fine plan
[01:25:43] <__adrian> but you do still need to know the basics of the language
[01:26:36] <ThePhilgrim> Yeah, I agree! That's what I'm trying to learn right now :)
[01:26:47] <__adrian> see links  :)
[01:26:54] <ThePhilgrim> Currently reading them
[01:26:59] <__adrian> :thumbs up:
[01:27:17] <ThePhilgrim> Right now I have a php file just saying var_dump($_POST)
[01:27:29] <__adrian> that will show you the structure of what you get
[01:27:44] <ThePhilgrim> Well, the problem is that I get it in a really weird format

[01:28:00] <ThePhilgrim> I don't know any server that I can run locally and that handles GET & POST
[01:28:13] <ThePhilgrim> Was using Python's http server, but it doesn't support POST requests
[01:28:17] <ThePhilgrim> So I couldn't see anything
[01:28:19] <__adrian> php does it. anything that runs php.
[01:28:39] <__adrian> if you want to do it locally, make a local dev env. use docker or a vm (or wsl2)
[01:28:41] <ThePhilgrim> A friend helped me to modify python's http server to support POST requests, but they come out in a weird format
[01:29:01] <__adrian> hacking something special together will not be useful to you
[01:29:24] <__adrian> your dev env needs to be similar to your intended production env. a python proxy that parses things "weird" is not that

[01:34:45] <__adrian> i'd assume brew would be the best way to install docker, but i haven't done it on mac in several years.
[01:35:03] <ThePhilgrim> To learn this stuff, I just set up a small experimentation project with a html file, a js file and a php file
[01:35:06] <__adrian> shouldn't be hard though. someone here might be able to help, or recommend finding a tutorial
[01:35:06] <ThePhilgrim> all in the same folder
[01:35:20] <ThePhilgrim> What is docker btw? :D
[01:35:31] <__adrian> bare files isn't practical - php runs on a server
[01:35:42] <__adrian> https://www.docker.com/
[01:35:58] <__adrian> container platform
[01:36:40] <__adrian> this allows you to set up a consistent, portable, reproducible, and (most importantly) isolated dev env
[01:37:07] <__adrian> you don't want to dev on your desktop os because it's absolutely nothing like the env where your web app will live in production
[01:37:40] <noord> ThePhilgrim: that will give you an idea https://termbin.com/bww5
[01:38:22] <ThePhilgrim> __adrian: I'm just building a portfolio website. Not a web app. I got shared hosting for it where I'll upload everything.. These bare files that I'm using now are just minimal stuff to understand fetch API
[01:38:32] <__adrian> php runs on a server
[01:38:52] <__adrian> "web app" → "whatever you're building with php"

[01:43:10] <__adrian> it's nice
[01:43:27] <__adrian> but in this case, probably a bit of complication you don't really need
[01:43:59] <ThePhilgrim> Okay
[01:44:30] <ThePhilgrim> I have to be completely honest. I'm on Dockers website, and I don't really understand what it does or what I would do with it :D
[01:44:34] <ThePhilgrim> Sorry for being slow
[01:44:41] <ThePhilgrim> I've had input overload the whole day
[01:44:49] <__adrian> start by looking for mac-oriented utorials
[01:45:51] <__adrian> a (docker) container is basically an isolated part of your system that acts like it's a separate computer. then you run a webserver and your php code on it.
[01:48:38] <ThePhilgrim> Hmm okay. My whole development journey up until recently has been python. And I've always set up virtual envs for each project. How is this different/better?
[01:50:31] <__adrian> it's not a question of "better." php does not run the way python does. python (generally) runs locally, whereas php (generally) runs on a webserver and interacts with your user via http (a web browser).

[01:50:51] <ThePhilgrim> Right, okay
[01:51:08] <ThePhilgrim> I think the bulb is slowly starting to light up ..
[01:51:37] <ThePhilgrim> So basically, I can set up a virtual front/backend environtment for developing ?
[01:51:39] <__adrian> a venv does serve a similar purpose (isolation) but not in the same way
[01:51:48] <ThePhilgrim> So that my front end can communicate with my backend etc?
[01:51:51] <__adrian> do you understand what a "virtual machine" is?
[01:52:52] <ThePhilgrim> Like a separate computer that lives in your physical computer ?
[01:53:16] <__adrian> yes
[01:53:23] <ThePhilgrim> Okay
[01:53:34] <__adrian> containers are sometimes called "paravirtualization"
[01:53:49] <__adrian> meaning they're similar in some ways to a VM, but they're not a VM.
[01:53:56] <ThePhilgrim> Hmm okay
[01:54:35] <__adrian> i.e., it acts like its own system, but there's no virtualized cpu/ram/etc.
[01:54:51] <__adrian> yes, your html/js frontend (in your browser) will communicate with your php backend via a webserver, over http.
[01:55:17] <__adrian> with docker, the webserver+php will be inside the docker container.
[01:55:40] <noord> ThePhilgrim: you can embed html code in php files, but it is totally discouraged
[01:55:41] <ThePhilgrim> Okay, will my html/css/js files be uploaded to the container too?
[01:55:56] <__adrian> yeah
[01:55:58] <ThePhilgrim> noord: Yeah, I like to keep everything separate :D
[01:56:28] <ThePhilgrim> Okay, so basically I wil simulate a fully functioning web app environment in a container?
[01:56:31] <__adrian> "embed html code in php files"  // well, some of your php files are application code and some are templates.
[01:56:36] <__adrian> !+php first
[01:56:36] <php-bot> your PHP code can be sorted into two categories: code which _performs work_ (processing input, controller logic, database access, error handling, etc.), and code which  _produces output_ (header(), echo, <?= $var ?>, plain ol' <html>, etc.). work goes FIRST. output goes LAST. https://gist.github.com/adrian-enspired/9ed2542a695e2ebe30aa
[01:56:56] <__adrian> and it's less "embed" and more "hey it's plain output"

[01:57:18] <__adrian> you'll _have_.
[01:57:38] <noord> ThePhilgrim: do you know how web frameworks works?
[01:57:46] <ThePhilgrim> Not really :D

[05:50:32] <Blondie101010> what's the problem?
[05:50:52] <paule32> i had this:  $desc_str = preg_replace($desc_str,'Diese Funktion wurde mit Version: 1.0.0 eingeführt. ','');
[05:51:18] <Blondie101010> what are you saying is wrong?
[05:51:22] <Blondie101010> be clear please
[05:51:40] <paule32> i had this:  $desc_str = preg_replace($desc_str,'Diese Funktion wurde mit Version: 1.0.0 eingeführt. ','');    and this parameter format is wrong
[05:51:45] <Blondie101010> with only that line, it's impossible to tell your intention
[05:52:10] <paule32> i regex the xml output

[05:53:35] <Blondie101010> no zip
[05:53:40] <paule32> ok
[05:53:51] <Blondie101010> a simple example on https://3v4l.org would be great
[05:54:10] <Blondie101010> but I realize you mixed both arguments, but you didn't clarify what you're complaining about
[05:54:26] <Blondie101010> the function definition and documentation clearly states what the parameters are
[05:55:45] <paule32> https://dpaste.com/GXVFSLGT6#line-156
[05:56:47] <Blondie101010> that doesn't tell me what you're complaining about
[05:57:24] <paule32> here: https://dpaste.com/GXVFSLGT6#line-345
[05:57:38] <paule32> i have a element <detaileddescription
[05:57:54] <paule32> and i would cut <simplesect
[05:58:16] <paule32> but keep intact, the note attribute
[05:59:06] <paule32> so i have two strings - 1x the description, and 1x simplesect @kind="note"
[05:59:12] <Blondie101010> I don't know what you're thinking but this is VERY far from being able to do anything
[05:59:32] <Blondie101010> it looks like you don't even grasp quotes
[06:00:12] <paule32> i can preg_replace the parts
[06:00:58] <Blondie101010> look at your code: $desc_str = preg_replace($desc_str,'/]]></xsl:text><xsl:value-of select="$impl"/><xsl:text disable-output-escaping="yes"><![

[06:02:54] <Blondie101010> so you want to make a regex out of another regex like noord assumed?
[06:03:06] <paule32> regex works
[06:03:18] <Blondie101010> ok what's the problem
[06:03:39] <paule32> but i had thinking to make the replace part by xlst functions with xlstproc tool
[06:03:56] <paule32> so my idea was the php part
[06:04:04] <noord> Blondie101010: didn't get it
[06:04:22] <paule32> instead waste time in toying with xml
[06:04:52] <noord> paule32: golden rule, If you have to implement a compiler or interpreter from scratch
[06:04:58] <Blondie101010> paule32:  I don't know what you do with xlst there, but you could possibly use !+preg_replace_callback

[10:33:47] <grawity> much like VB is the MS successor to QuickBASIC, apparently

[10:34:09] <grawity> either way, "bytes to integer" is done via unpack() in PHP and several other languages

[13:41:25] <biberu> yes

[13:42:07] <biberu> windows/linux
[13:42:38] <ThePhilgrim> Okay :)
[13:42:48] <ThePhilgrim> I'm on macos. Hopefully can figure this out tho
[13:43:29] <biberu> ThePhilgrim: i think it may be night for __adrian btw
[13:44:21] <ThePhilgrim> Yeah, I assume so :)
[13:45:33] <ThePhilgrim> biberu: Maybe you can confirm. I'm setting up docker because __adrian adviced me to. That way I'll be able test frontend/backend functionality when building my website?
[13:46:21] <biberu> yes
[13:47:26] <ThePhilgrim> I set up a html file with a form input and a submit button, and a JS script that will take the value of the input and send it as a FormData object with a POST request. Then I have a php file (I know nothing about PHP yet). And I want to be able to access the FormData in the PHP file
[13:47:33] <ThePhilgrim> Will docker make sense for this?
[13:48:02] <Naktibalda> have you read anything about docker?
[13:48:59] <biberu> ThePhilgrim: there's a threshold when learning the tool ofc, but i'd use it even for trivial scenarios
[13:50:11] <ThePhilgrim> Naktibalda: I'm currently watching tutorials to understand it
[13:50:24] <Naktibalda> It won't help you with testing or writing code, it builds the environment and runs the code.
[13:51:02] <ThePhilgrim> biberu: The problem is that I can't seem to find another way to test my POST requests. I struggled the whole day yesterday trying to find a server that can show me POST requests as well as handle GET requests
[13:51:29] <biberu> ThePhilgrim: you'll get important advantages in that your environment can be isolated from other projects on the same machine (this project uses php 7? another uses php 8? different db? not a problem) and that it can be version controlled (when you have a working configuration you can just commit it as code to your vcs, share it with other machines
[13:51:29] <biberu> or developers, and safely try things like updating php or whatever)
[13:51:48] <ThePhilgrim> Naktibalda: Sure, but if I send a POST request to a PHP file and the PHP file dumps it, I will be able to see the format of what the PHP file dumps?
[13:52:07] <biberu> <?php var_dump($_POST);
[13:52:49] <ThePhilgrim> Yeah, I got a PHP file with that line. But I haven't figured out a way to see what it dumps yet
[13:53:23] <biberu> you can check the network log in your browser for the raw output
[13:53:47] <ThePhilgrim> Hmm, okay
[13:54:03] <biberu> do you know where to find that?
[13:54:09] <Naktibalda> yes, you can test the code when you have server running
[13:54:24] <ThePhilgrim> Yes, I do. I did it yesterday but I didn't manage to access the FormData in a good way
[13:54:33] <ThePhilgrim> Maybe I just need to understand how to access it with PHP
[13:55:01] <ThePhilgrim> Naktibalda: I usually use python3's http server, but it doesn't support POST requests
[13:56:02] <ThePhilgrim> biberu, Naktibalda do you guys know anything about fetch API / FormData in JS?
[13:56:12] <ThePhilgrim> (I know we're in the PHP channel)
[13:56:28] <biberu> yes
[13:57:38] <ThePhilgrim> Okay, so maybe you can help me understand what I actually need to do here. I've been struggling for 2 days lol xD
[13:58:18] <ThePhilgrim> 1) I have a barebones html file that only has a form. Two inputs, name and email. It also has a submit button. That's it
[13:58:50] <ThePhilgrim> 2) I have a JS file, creates a FormData object from the form data, and uses fetch API to send it to a file that I call dump.php
[13:59:06] <ThePhilgrim> 3) dump.php only has <?php var_dump($_POST);
[14:01:01] <ThePhilgrim> I cd to the folder in the terminal and do "python3 -m http.server"
[14:01:02] <biberu> sure
[14:01:19] <ThePhilgrim> I put "Foo" in name, "blah@blah.com" in email, and I click submit

[14:01:43] <ThePhilgrim> In the network tab in the browser "dump.php" is red, and I get "Status Code: 501 Unsupported method ('POST')"
[14:01:46] <grawity> python's http.server will not run CGI or PHP for you though
[14:01:55] <grawity> it only does GET/HEAD for static files
[14:02:07] <grawity> you need `php -S` for this to work
[14:02:15] <ThePhilgrim> Right, that's what I was struggling with the whole day yesterday. People tried to show me Node servers that I could use etc
[14:02:18] <biberu> why are you mixing python and php?
[14:02:26] <ordos> ^ that
[14:02:28] <ThePhilgrim> But they wouldn't work with GET requests, so I couldn't see my form
[14:02:44] <ThePhilgrim> I'm only using the python server because it's the only way I know to set up a local server
[14:02:45] <grawity> biberu: probably because that's just the usual suggestion for "instant http server on localhost"
[14:02:56] <ThePhilgrim> Correct
[14:03:02] <biberu> ThePhilgrim: right, well, did you install docker?
[14:03:21] <ThePhilgrim> I've been building my portfolio website for the last few weeks, and to develop the html/css, I've used the Python http server
[14:03:32] <ThePhilgrim> biberu: I did install it, but I haven't configured anything yet
[14:03:34] * grawity one of my first PHP projects was ... a webserver written in PHP, with support for CGI
[14:03:39] <biberu> ThePhilgrim: ok, hang on a second
[14:03:50] <ThePhilgrim> biberu: Will docker help me with my problem?
[14:04:32] <ordos> docker is a great tool but I get the impression you need to learn some PHP basics first
[14:04:33] <ThePhilgrim> grawity: A friend helped me yesterday to modify Python's http server to get POST requests too
[14:04:40] <ordos> use php -S as suggested further up
[14:04:57] <ThePhilgrim> But the POST output is not very well processed
[14:05:05] <ThePhilgrim> ordos: what do you mean use php -S?
[14:05:32] <biberu> eh, it's trivial to get it going in docker too
[14:05:37] <ordos> ThePhilgrim, https://www.php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.webserver.php
[14:05:46] <ThePhilgrim> I intend to learn basic PHP. But I'm just trying to set a basic var_dump POST now, because I'm actually trying to learn fetch API / FormData
[14:06:00] <biberu> ThePhilgrim: docker run --rm -p "8080:80" -v "/path/to/your/files:/var/www/html" php:8.0.13-apache-buster
[14:06:23] <ThePhilgrim> So that I can extend the html form, modify the FormData so that I can see how it works
[14:06:41] <ThePhilgrim> Then when I underdtand that, I'll start looking at PHP and how to process the data coming from fetch()
[14:06:48] <grawity> ThePhilgrim: instead of running `python -m http.server` you would run `php -S localhost:8000`
[14:07:06] <biberu> ThePhilgrim: that'll start a container from the php:8.0.13-apache-buster image with /path/to/your/files mounted on the webroot, and port 8080 exposed to the host, so you can visit http://localhost:8080, and there's your webserver with php running already
[14:07:09] <ThePhilgrim> grawity: Ah, it's just the PHP version of a local server?
[14:07:20] <ThePhilgrim> biberu: Ah okay
[14:07:27] <grawity> ThePhilgrim: yes, with .php support
[14:07:30] <ordos> ThePhilgrim, check out that link I pasted above
[14:07:49] <ThePhilgrim> ordos: Will do! Information overload! Trying to catch up with you guys
[14:07:53] <biberu> ThePhilgrim: then in /path/to/your/files create one file that's called e.g. receive.php and enter <?php var_dump($_POST); in it
[14:08:03] <ThePhilgrim> For my test purposes, what makes most sense? Use php -S or the docker thingy?
[14:08:24] <ThePhilgrim> Docker seems a bit more like something that I need to spend a lot of time on
[14:08:41] <ThePhilgrim> php -S localhost seems easier atm, fair?
[14:08:50] <biberu> ThePhilgrim: then make another, e.g. form.html, and add a script that contains the following:
[14:08:56] <biberu> const formData = new FormData(); formData.append("foo", "bar"); fetch("/receive.php", { method: "POST", body: formData }).then(r => console.log(r));

[14:17:55] <biberu> ThePhilgrim: thresholds don't get lower because you wait, but it depends on your context and goals
[14:18:08] <ThePhilgrim> biberu: I do think it would be worthwhile. The problem is that I'm learning html/css/js/node/php/http/api's/git/soon php etc etc at the same time
[14:18:14] <ThePhilgrim> If I start with Docker too I might explode
[14:18:36] <biberu> perhaps, perhaps not
[14:18:47] <biberu> did you see the docker command above? docker run ...?
[14:19:08] <Naktibalda> why are you learning both NodeJS and PHP?
[14:20:07] <ThePhilgrim> Naktibalda: Because I want to learn NodeJS to hopefully be able to work with backend in the future. I'm learning PHP because my shared hosting does not support Node
[14:20:25] <biberu> why do you need that host?
[14:20:38] <ThePhilgrim> Cause I already have a plan with them from when I only needed a wordpress site
[14:20:40] <biberu> you can host stuff locally for learning, and use whatever you please
[14:20:43] <biberu> easy with docker... ;)
[14:20:49] <ThePhilgrim> Then I realized I hate wordpress, so I decidedto learn web dev

[14:21:32] <biberu> but if you don't really need or want to learn php why spend time on that? ^^

[14:22:10] <biberu> hehe, ok
[14:22:21] <biberu> well, feel free to ask later if you need help to get it running
[14:22:21] <ThePhilgrim> I plan to use PHPMailer to get the FormData to my email

[15:11:07] <ThePhilgrim> In my PHP file I changed the simple var_dump($_POST) to "<?php var_dump($_POST['name']);?>"
[15:12:09] <biberu> ThePhilgrim: you don't need the last ?> (and shouldn't use that in code files, that can easily lead to trailing whitespace being emitted as part of the response)
[15:12:21] <ThePhilgrim> Oh, okay
[15:12:38] <biberu> did you manage to start a server?
[15:12:40] <ThePhilgrim> biberu: Do you use chrome or firefox?
[15:12:57] <biberu> both
[15:13:30] <ThePhilgrim> Okay, I notice a difference between the network tabs in Chrome and firefox
[15:13:41] <ThePhilgrim> The chrome POST request is parsed, the firefox one is not
[15:13:52] <ThePhilgrim> Seems like there is no option in Firefox to view the parsed request
[15:13:57] <biberu> parsed?
[15:14:22] <ThePhilgrim> In Chrome, under network -> payload
[15:14:32] <ThePhilgrim> If you get a post request there, you can choose "view source"
[15:14:49] <ThePhilgrim> And if you click it, it changes to "view parsed"
[15:14:54] <ThePhilgrim> I'll show you the difference, sec
[15:15:49] <ThePhilgrim> https://pastebin.com/heUwFxYV
[15:15:54] <ThePhilgrim> This is Chrome
[15:16:02] <ThePhilgrim> In Firefox, you always get the "SOURCE" version
[15:16:13] <biberu> sure
[15:16:28] <ThePhilgrim> The parsed version seems easier to work with
[15:16:54] <biberu> *shrug*
[15:17:08] <ThePhilgrim> Anyways, even if I now have var_dump($_POST['name']), the Payload shows the whole FormData
[15:17:15] <ThePhilgrim> as in, it shows both name and email
[15:17:23] <ThePhilgrim> If I got to preview
[15:17:28] <ThePhilgrim> I get "string(4) "Phil""
[15:17:38] <ThePhilgrim> Which seems to be what I'm looking for
[15:17:49] <ThePhilgrim> However, what does "string(4)" mean?

[17:23:27] <ThePhilgrim> So, this is the first time I make a php file in an actual project. My folder structure looks like this: https://pastebin.com/gAip3Y4p  Where would it make sense to put the PHPMailer file that will take the FormData and send it to my e-mail?
[17:24:11] <ThePhilgrim> The file should be unaccessible for users
[17:31:06] <grawity> if it needs to accept a POST, then by nature it has to be accessible to users, no?
[17:41:08] *** Joins: remolej2 (~kenoba@user/kenoba)
[17:41:12] <Naktibalda> ThePhilgrim: all static files that you have in your project are usually placed in public/ directory, so the files that aren't in that directory are inaccessible
[17:41:29] <Naktibalda> you need at least one php file in public/ as grawity said
[17:42:25] <ThePhilgrim> Hmm, somebody told me to send all the form data to the server, so that sensitive information can't be shown client-side.
[17:42:44] <ThePhilgrim> What would be the structure of this then? I have a js script that sends the data with fetch api to the server
[17:42:55] <grawity> yes, but the only way to send it to the server *is* by accessing something that the user can access
[17:42:59] *** Quits: remolej (~kenoba@user/kenoba) (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[17:42:59] *** remolej2 is now known as remolej
[17:43:20] <grawity> of course, that doesn't mean the user will be able to read all your <?php source code – it's executed on the server, not sent to the user
[17:43:28] <ThePhilgrim> Which would be the FormData in this case? which is input by the user
[17:43:39] <ThePhilgrim> That's what I mean
[17:43:49] <ThePhilgrim> Because my SMTP credentials will be in the php file
[17:43:56] <ThePhilgrim> And I don't want users to be able to see that

[17:49:17] <ThePhilgrim> grawity: Does this mean that I only need one PHP file living on the server then?
[17:49:46] <grawity> generally yes
[17:50:39] <grawity> though you *could* split the credentials into a separate file that's outside the 'public' directory (either a PHP file that's require()'d, or a yaml/json/.env file that's otherwise loaded) – and probably should, to guard against webserver configuration mistakes
[17:51:34] <biberu> indeed, don't put everything in one file, but do have one entry point if possible
[17:52:45] <ThePhilgrim> Right, my plan was to keep the credentials in a json and import them into the PHP file
[17:53:15] <ThePhilgrim> Does it matter if I put the PHP file in the public directory or outside it?
[17:53:18] *** Joins: stenno (~stenno@user/stenno)
[17:53:36] <grawity> at least *some* PHP has to be in the public directory, otherwise the user couldn't POST your form data to it
[17:53:59] <ThePhilgrim> So JS fetch() cannot access a file that's not in the public directory?
[17:54:22] <ThePhilgrim> I can't do fetch('php-file-not-in-public') {...} ?
[17:54:31] <grawity> no
[17:54:34] <ThePhilgrim> Hmm okay
[17:54:44] <grawity> there isn't any magic to fetch() that would allow it to access something that the user can't access otherwise
[17:54:50] <ThePhilgrim> Okay
[17:54:53] <biberu> thankfully :D
[17:55:21] <ThePhilgrim> And if I put my PHP file with the PHPMailer code in the public file, can the user read the code in any way?
[17:55:34] <grawity> not as long as PHP is working correctly on the server
[17:55:38] <ThePhilgrim> In other words, would it be safe, security wise, to keep the PHPMailer code in the public dir?
[17:57:03] <grawity> technically yes, although like I said, moving the credentials out is still good *to guard against mistakes*
[17:57:10] <ThePhilgrim> Got it
[17:57:13] <grawity> like if the web server accidentally gets mod_php disabled
[17:57:42] <grawity> or if your text editor creates a .php~ backup
[17:58:02] <ThePhilgrim> So, now while I'm just developing the website, is there a convention where you put the php file locally? Similar to "put the style.css in a folder called css, and the js files in a folder called scripts" ?
[17:58:41] <biberu> ThePhilgrim: ideally your public directory should contain a single file that requests are routed to, that file is the main entry point of your application and inspects the requests and decides what to do with it, and it loads configuration, definitions etc. from files outside of the public directory
[17:58:44] *** Joins: ferdna (~ferdna@user/ferdna)
[17:59:16] <biberu> ThePhilgrim: since the phpmailer scripts shouldn't be directly requested they shouldn't be in the public directory, easy
[18:00:13] <noord> ThePhilgrim: some put in app, src, entry it is up to you
[18:00:49] <ThePhilgrim> Ah, so html/css/js in public dir. JS uses fetch to send to 'mother-of-all-requests.php' (also in public dir) that in turn evaluates the data, and sends the FormData to php-mailer-file.php that is outside of public dir?
[18:01:04] *** Joins: jetchisel (jetchisel@user/jetchisel)
[18:03:45] <grawity> not so much "sends" to it, but imports the whole .php file
[18:04:21] <biberu> ThePhilgrim: mother-of-all-requests.php could even start with simply requiring php-mailer-file.php, and in case of a server misconfiguration the public directory wouldn't contain anything sensitive
[18:05:31] <noord> ThePhilgrim: the mother-of-all-requests is a router component, yesterday I mentioned it evaluates which function will be executed regarding URI
[18:05:46] <noord> and headers
[18:05:48] <ThePhilgrim> Hmm, okay. I'll start trying to implement this slowly and I'll show my code when I have something reasonable. For now I'll store the PHPMailer file in /resources/php/
[18:06:03] <ThePhilgrim> noord right

[18:24:36] <ThePhilgrim> Sec
[18:25:23] <sobrito> Does anyone have an example or link teaching how to do documentation for a new php extension (written in C)?
[18:25:38] <rigid> when I do: setcookie(...); echo("foo");  the output appears inside the <body> tag
[18:26:17] <rigid> is there a way to require*() outside of the .php file?
[18:27:10] <Naktibalda> rigid: that final question makes no sense
[18:27:13] <ThePhilgrim> Here we go https://pastebin.com/S2fvdHqG
[18:27:33] <TinoDidriksen> rigid, best way is to defer all output until all headers are sent. The quick'n'dirty way to do this is enabling output buffering. The correct way is to build up the output until you know it's safe to output.
[18:27:38] <Naktibalda> rigid: probably you are calling setcookie() in a file which is required by another file
[18:30:02] <rigid> Naktibalda: i mean via cmdline or php.ini or anything i might have missed
[18:30:40] <rigid> ah, it is actually sent first. The browser seems to mangle it. but setcookie() still doesn't work :(
[18:30:52] <rigid> i just checked with curl and in the output it comes before <html>

[18:32:51] <rigid> Naktibalda: i don't get an error message. setcookie() just doesn't affect the "Set-Cookie" header
[18:33:34] <Naktibalda> then change the order of echo and setcookie and see if you get an error
[18:34:24] <Naktibalda> classic problem returns or logs error about output before header

[22:08:37] <ThePhilgrim> If I have a json file with {"name": "Foo", "age": 68} , and I have a php file where I do $jsonData = file_get_contents('jsonfile.json'), $jsonData would be an array right?
[22:08:45] <__adrian> no
[22:08:53] <__adrian> it would be a string. json is a string format
[22:08:53] <ThePhilgrim> Object?
[22:08:58] <ThePhilgrim> oh
[22:09:03] <ThePhilgrim> Okay, I need to decode?
[22:09:03] <__adrian> https://php.net/json_decode
[22:09:06] <ThePhilgrim> right!
[22:09:16] <__adrian> highly recommend $assoc = true
[22:09:20] <ThePhilgrim> Was trying to understand the difference between decode and encode
[22:09:29] <ThePhilgrim> What does $assoc = true mean?
[22:09:30] <__adrian> encode → make json
[22:09:38] <__adrian> decode → make data
[22:09:42] <ThePhilgrim> Ah okay
[22:09:52] <__adrian> it's described on the man page
[22:10:01] <__adrian> tl;dr: makes arrays instead of objects.
[22:10:07] <ThePhilgrim> And i I then do $decodedJson = $jsonData.decode(), I now have an array, right?
[22:10:12] <ThePhilgrim> ah ok
[22:10:20] <__adrian> that's not php syntax  ;)
[22:10:25] <ThePhilgrim> :D
[22:10:28] <__adrian> $data = json_decode($json);
[22:10:32] <__adrian> $data = json_decode($json, true);
[22:10:47] <stenno> just look it up instead of guessing
[22:10:53] <__adrian> ^
[22:11:01] <stenno> __adrian provided you the link
[22:11:07] <ThePhilgrim> I know, but I have a really hard time understanding the PHP manual
[22:11:26] <__adrian> https://php.net/{name of function or search term}
[22:11:46] <ThePhilgrim> Yeah, I know.. But I was looking at arrays in the php manual and I don't understand how to access the values
[22:11:58] <ThePhilgrim> I'm trying to access the value of "name"
[22:11:59] <__adrian> did you look at  https://php.net/array  ?
[22:12:33] <__adrian> looks at "Example #7 Accessing array elements"
[22:12:57] <ThePhilgrim> Yes, but I didn't get it ..because I thought I had an array after doing file_get_contents
[22:13:01] <__adrian> you access items with [brackets], by key name.
[22:13:26] <ThePhilgrim> That's what I tried.. but on a string apparently
[22:13:28] <ThePhilgrim> Thanks
[22:13:29] <__adrian> mm. that's also something you can find out - every function page tells you what the "Return Values" are/can be
[22:14:05] <biberu> and abuse var_dump (or a debugger)
[22:14:07] <__adrian> yeah, the [] notation is also valid on strings (it accesses bytes by position)
[22:16:35] <stenno> bytes?
[22:16:56] <__adrian> a byte
[22:17:35] <stenno> wait how do you handle UTF-16 character access
[22:17:44] <__adrian> php strings do not have characters
[22:17:58] <stenno> thats unfortunate
[22:17:59] <__adrian> there's no "character" in php. only bytes.
[22:18:14] <__adrian> that's why multibyte-aware string functions exist
[22:19:13] <biberu> even that isn't safe when it comes to unicode though
[22:19:25] <__adrian> what? mb_* functions?
[22:19:32] <__adrian> they are perfectly safe
[22:19:32] <biberu> yep
[22:19:43] <__adrian> assuming you tell them which charset you're using
[22:19:50] <__adrian> and even in most cases if you don't
[22:19:58] <stenno> found this for example https://www.php.net/manual/de/function.mb-str-split.php
[22:20:13] <biberu> a naive mb_substr can alter the appearance of text
[22:20:51] <__adrian> guessing you mean with combining characters?
[22:21:18] <biberu> normalization forms, zero width joins etc require extra care
[22:21:23] <biberu> yeah
[22:21:26] <__adrian> yeah
[22:21:32] <__adrian> use intl for normalization
[22:21:40] <__adrian> or iconv
[22:21:57] <Sammitch> iconv is gross. intl always.
[22:22:14] <__adrian> agree, but iconv does have the advantage of being very well-known
[22:22:28] <__adrian> and in the end it's fine, it does things right
[22:23:30] <Sammitch> I almost bit through my tongue this morning in standup when a dev was talking about "removing unicode characters" from a datafile we ship =_=
[22:23:39] <__adrian> hehe
[22:23:48] <__adrian> they're very special
[22:24:05] <__adrian> i'll leave it to you to decide whether i'm referring to the characters or the developer

[23:27:09] <steve> So I'm writing some code that will access someone else's SOAP API. They've provided a wsdl for the objects that their API returns. Is there a good way of generating php objects from the API response without a tool like wsdl2phpgenerator ?
[23:27:30] <steve> I was hoping I could just have the objects generated "on the fly" without having to make a bunch of php classes
[23:28:04] <steve> Mostly because if their API changes, I don't want to have to re-build all of those php class files...
[23:29:46] <TinoDidriksen> If the API changes, you'd have a bunch of manual work anyway to either convert code or make a conversion layer. A code generator doesn't help much there.
[23:30:17] <steve> This is true
[23:30:24] <__adrian> are we talking about just properties or behavior (methods) too?
[23:30:25] <ThePhilgrim> Is it possible to use json_decode and file_get_contents together, something similar to "$decodedData = json_decode(file_get_contents('mydata.json'), true);" ?
[23:30:37] <TinoDidriksen> ThePhilgrim, sure.
[23:30:40] <__adrian> ThePhilgrim: !+tias
[23:30:40] <php-bot> ThePhilgrim, [TIAS] Try It And See. If you want to know if or how something works, try it first. "Testing Is Absolutely Simple"
[23:30:50] <steve> Just properties
[23:30:51] <ThePhilgrim> I did try it
[23:30:56] <ThePhilgrim> but got an error
[23:30:57] <ThePhilgrim> hold on
[23:31:04] <__adrian> though  "mydata.json"  strongly recommend always using fully qualified filesystem paths.
[23:31:10] <TinoDidriksen> Generally you'd want to file_get_contents() first to handle file I/O errors separately.
[23:31:19] <ThePhilgrim> "PHP Warning:  Array to string conversion in /Users/Writing/Documents/contact-form-test/dump.php on line 13"
[23:31:25] <steve> Having the getters/setters wouldn't be the worst thing in the world either, but if they're all just public properties, it'd be fine too
[23:31:52] <TinoDidriksen> Sure you're using file_get_contents() and not file() ?
[23:31:57] <__adrian> ThePhilgrim: that wouldn't happen from the code you showed us. please share the actual code.
[23:32:32] <ThePhilgrim> This is the whole code https://dpaste.com/33DXJPP4E
[23:33:42] <__adrian> steve: you could just use stdClass objects (or arrays ;) but really you're just making things worse on yourself. "on the fly" means you're just making assumptions about the responses. like TinoDidriksen says, this would cause problems when the api changes - and would make finding the specific problem more difficult.
[23:33:45] <ThePhilgrim> TinoDidriksen: So you would suggest me to break it into two separate statements?
[23:34:02] <__adrian> ThePhilgrim: read the line number from your error  ;)
[23:34:25] <steve> Yeah, you're probably right..
[23:34:30] <ThePhilgrim> Ah, you can't echo an array?
[23:34:46] <__adrian> no. echo is for strings (or for things that can be converted to string)
[23:34:50] <__adrian> https://php.net/echo
[23:35:07] <AllenJB> Use var_dump() if you want to debug the value of variables

[23:50:26] <__adrian> regarding whether you need to set reply-to (or any other headers), that's more of a question of deliverability  ;)
