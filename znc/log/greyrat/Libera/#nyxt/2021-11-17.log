[22:54:19] <mariari> not using nyxt for a while has been a pain, being forced to have tabs for everything is rough
[22:57:29] <mariari> with the latest nyxt I have been getting some weird errors though
[22:57:33] <mariari> fatal error encountered in SBCL pid 157838 tid 189032:

[22:57:39] <mariari> where my current buffers arne't saved out
[22:59:35] <waleee> mariari: did you only update nyxt and not cl-webkit?
[23:00:17] <mariari> yes
[23:00:21] <mariari> cl-webkit has been stable this boot
[23:00:33] <mariari> seems killing a buffer causes this
[23:00:35] <mariari> I see
[23:00:39] <mariari> every time i kill a buffer
[23:00:49] <waleee> you haven't updated cl-webkit?
[23:00:51] <mariari> and when I restore all my buffers it seems to segfault
[23:00:54] <mariari> not since 2 boots ago
[23:01:04] <mariari> I rebooted specifically to make sure it wasn't an issue
[23:01:12] <waleee> aartaka has been iterating it quite fast in the recent weeks
[23:01:46] <mariari> it's been rough as I couldn't even use nyxt last time I've updated it
[23:01:54] <waleee> and the latest days nyxt updated the cl-webkit submodule to the latest version of cl-webkit
[23:01:55] <mariari> I've updated it now it has these issues just rough having to use firefox
[23:02:33] <waleee> * latest version == 11 hours ago
[23:03:31] <mariari> yeah I'm using that
[23:03:40] <mariari> well using the latest nyxt
[23:03:45] <mariari> maybe not teh latest cl-webkit
[23:03:52] <mariari> doesn't nyxt peg it off a specific version
[23:04:02] <mariari> I have nix installed now for work so I can grab a specific version from there
[23:06:11] <waleee> the nix version is 2.0.0
[23:06:22] <waleee> * at least in nixpkgs
[23:17:18] *** Quits: ebrasca (~user@librepanther.com) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:26:52] <mariari> I see, probably not too helpful then
[23:27:02] <mariari> just annoying as I want to use nyxt, maybe next week
[23:27:28] <mariari> hmm wait
[23:27:32] <mariari> nix-repl> webkit.version
[23:27:34] <mariari> "2.34.1"
[23:27:49] <mariari> seems the version if I just grab webkit it'll be 2.34.1 on the unstable packages that I have in the channel
[23:28:50] <waleee> ah, I meant that 2.0.0 was the nyxt version in nixpkgs master-branch
[23:29:05] <mariari> oh the nyxt version, I see
[23:29:13] <waleee> webkit 2.0.0 would be truly ancient
[23:33:04] <sirmacik> \o
[23:33:15] <waleee> however that the webkit is at 2.34.1 in unstable would be an issue since https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/applications/networking/browsers/nyxt/default.nix just specifies webkitgtk
[23:35:35] <waleee> mariari: ... which would default to 2.34.1 which is uncompatible with 2.0.0
[23:36:28] <mariari> I'm not using the nix of nyxt, I was curious if I should fix my version with nix for nyxt
[23:36:35] <mariari> since I use my system implementation currently
[23:37:31] <waleee> ah. In the stable (nixos-21.05) channel you would get a working nyxt I imagine
[23:37:51] <mariari> well I'd prefer to make the most recent nyxt stable if that is at all possible
