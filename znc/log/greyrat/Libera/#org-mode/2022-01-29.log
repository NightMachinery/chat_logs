[18:28:16] <chris64> Codaraxis: and then restore the point at the original cursor position
[18:28:38] <chris64> Codaraxis: after you found all the blocks

[18:33:46] <Codaraxis> chris64, Yeah, that is what I was considering. Though, really, I should probably stop fighting Org mode on this one since I'd need to find the block, then backtrack to see if it has titles/properties/etc., and subtrees handle all that quite nicely. I just can't explicitly end them.
[18:34:59] <chris64> Codaraxis: Oh, I wouldn't say you'd be fighting it only because you're looking for information that's outside of properties or headings
[18:35:50] <chris64> Codaraxis: are the titles expected on the block itself? or in the heading? because I believe there's a function to go to the corresponding heading of the current point
[18:37:59] <Codaraxis> They're tied to the block. The heading itself contains the the source of the information rather than a description of the content.
[18:39:03] <chris64> and what do you mean by you "just can't explicitly end them?"
[18:39:20] <Codaraxis> So, it would be nice to have * Section 1
[18:40:36] <Codaraxis> oops, * Section X \nThoughts and content ** A more interesting blurb/definition/subsection\n More Content\n** End the interesting blurb and go back to commenting on comment X
[18:41:54] <chris64> ah I see
[18:42:26] <chris64> I guess :NOTE: is not enough, right?
[18:43:32] <chris64> or custom blocks? and what was the context behind the question how to find such blocks?
[18:43:36] <Codaraxis> I'm not familiar with that? Could you point out any reading?
[18:43:42] <chris64> (sorry, I'm just curious)
[18:45:38] <chris64> Codaraxis: :NOTE: is a drawer, like those: https://orgmode.org/manual/Drawers.html I don't know anymore whether this exists by default or whether you have to define it in the config, let me check
[18:47:13] <chris64> there is: (setq org-drawers (quote ("PROPERTIES" "LOGBOOK" "NOTES" "CLOCKTABLE")))
[18:47:41] <Codaraxis> Nah, happy to explain. Basically, I'm trying to give the Zettelkasten method a shot, while also learning more about Org mode and holding off from trying out Org Roam. So, the goal is, while taking notes on something to potentially creating a note in the middle.
[18:47:42] <chris64> After defining those a block that looks like :NOTES:\nsome content\nsome more content\n:END: can be cycled
[18:48:50] *** Quits: sbilik (~user@c-75-67-253-211.hsd1.nh.comcast.net) (Quit: Going to play with znc)
[18:49:05] <Codaraxis> So, when programming, I'd like to pull all my #+BEGIN_LESSON #+END_LESSON notes, maybe randomly pare them down using a QUALITY_RATING property attached to said note, and throw them up in a temporary buffer to glance at while coding as sort of "things to think about while coding today"
[18:50:09] <Codaraxis> And I don't see a notes drawer as working because it's at the top. I imagine this would come about while studying something, writing my stream of consciousness notes, and maybe in the middle creating a short "LESSON" block that I might what to find later, before returning to stream-of-consciousness notes
[18:50:16] <chris64> Codaraxis: something like https://orgmode.org/manual/Dynamic-Blocks.html ?
[18:50:50] <chris64> Codaraxis: drawers can be put anywhere, so they don't need to be a at the top of a section
[18:51:23] <chris64> but I am not sure if they nest within dynamic blocks or something similar
[18:51:55] <Codaraxis> Ah. I wasn't entirely aware of that. The dynamic blocks definitely look very promising
[18:52:16] *** Joins: sbilik (~Scott@c-75-67-253-211.hsd1.nh.comcast.net)
[18:53:46] <chris64> looks like you can't attach additional meta information to drawers, at least not by default
[18:55:58] <chris64> maybe functionality implemented for captions could be reusable for drawers https://orgmode.org/manual/Captions.html
[18:56:11] <Codaraxis> There's also potentially a superior option, which is what I would /actually/ like to use, but it relies on an additional project I've never played around with: a transclusion. My only concern is how it would integrate with/break things
[18:56:12] <chris64> but maybe this breaks assumptions of a table following a caption
[18:56:28] <chris64> what is a transclusion?
[18:56:36] <Codaraxis> https://github.com/nobiot/org-transclusion
[18:57:05] <Codaraxis> A transclusion is the seamless inclusion of a portion of another file/document in the current one
[18:57:20] <Codaraxis> such that they are (ideally) seamlessly connected so that alterations to one alter the other
[18:57:28] <Codaraxis> I liken them to Portals from the video game portal.
[18:58:34] <Codaraxis> I've wanted transclusions in my editor for so long, but no one seems to have implemented them without issues.

[19:02:50] <chris64> wow, that's interesting
[19:05:28] <Codaraxis> Yeah. I don't know if it was the origin, but Ted Nelson's Project Xanadu was where I learned about it. I always hoped it would be completed to form part of what I thought of as the ideal editor, but I don't think I could give up all the other features of Org mode for it, even if it finished, which it never will.
[19:05:29] <Codaraxis> So, now I just hope I will be able to slowly incorporate its features (mainly transclusions) into Org mode.
[19:08:59] <chris64> very cool, thank you for that one, for quite some time I wondered whether I should return to org-mode for note taking, similar to you considered org-roam or the other zettelkasten alternative but had some different taste wrt to how they do certain things
[19:10:21] <chris64> and I know that the roam approach somehow favors copying and adapting when it comes to reusing and further developing previous notes
[19:10:45] <chris64> or knowledge, but this might be a nice alternative to that
[19:14:49] <chris64> do you know org-capture? maybe it could be an alternative for related but separate thoughts and ideas you got while working on a note
[19:15:53] <Codaraxis> What do you use for note-taking if not Org mode? I've been using it for task tracking and note taking, but am now looking to use it to help synthesize new information and generally guide activities
[19:16:16] <Codaraxis> And yeah, I've heard of Org capture but haven't used it overmuch

[19:19:03] <chris64> I once write just raw org-mode files, one per day. later for like half a year I had physical notebooks that fit into my trouser pockets, because I mostly had to jot down things when I was not on the computer. those notebooks where similar to bullet journals but with the addition of month, week and topic-based todo lists. mostly because tasks usually get shifted a lot
[19:20:10] <chris64> the org-mode files covered both note taking and task tracking, the physical notebooks primarily track tracking

[19:23:04] <Codaraxis> Yeah. I moved from bullet notebooks/fieldnotes to a smartphone that I could write on with a stylus. I spend a lot of time in front of a computer and when I don't, I build up few enough notes that it's easy and quick to transfer over. Granted, backlogs can be a bit daunting
[19:23:13] <Codaraxis> One day I'll get around to learning Orgzly(?)

[19:25:22] <Codaraxis> Yeah, it's Orgzly. Just had to go check.
[19:26:21] <chris64> Orgzly is really cool but somehow I didn't get to the point using it. Back then clocking time was very important to me and this was not possible and I wasn't able to contribute. Nowadays I sent myself e-mails in threads and add new thoughts and ideas. I've already for some time the aim to import those into org-mode files
[19:27:46] <chris64> but didn't yet start with it yet, because I first need to get the mails onto the computer using mbsync and then some indexing like mu or notmuch
[19:35:11] <Codaraxis> Yeah. There are a lot of miscellaneous projects like that that just take time. Switching systems can be hard, even when the system being switched to is better
[19:35:30] <chris64> indeed
