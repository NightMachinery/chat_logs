[06:45:41] <nakilon> I feel like I need something like this made in Ruby https://github.com/afroisalreadyinu/miniboss#lifecycle-events to control a pile of doker containers on my server
[06:47:43] <nakilon> not just compose replacement but something higher; maybe I'm reinventing something though, but currently I have a huge README-like config copypasta I put together for a case "if I need to recreate/fix the server" that is a hugely easier because of being in docker-compose that hwat it was before but I feel like it can be even better
[06:48:29] <nakilon> some docker services orchestration with ability to write their management logic as a Ruby script
[06:50:28] <ox1eef> Python looks to be leading in that area
[06:53:49] <nakilon> it's leading in wasting people resources
[06:54:04] <nakilon>  /s
[06:56:21] <ox1eef> what do you mean
[06:58:26] <ox1eef> python is lucky in that way, far more diverse application of use in the mainstream. 
[06:58:50] <ox1eef> at one time it seemed it could have been ruby, i remember vagrant being ruby once.
[06:59:02] <nakilon> the mainstream is not code or even use pc but sit and drink in night club
[06:59:09] <nakilon> and to not build anything
[06:59:25] <nakilon> rather destroy, consume and create problems, not solve
[06:59:25] <ox1eef> haha true
[07:00:23] <nakilon> idk what was that luck that vagrant was in ruby, not pithon, but they are of absolutely the same range of applicabiilty
[07:00:27] <ox1eef> on twitter python is what everyone learns and recommends, at least among the influencers
[07:00:51] <ox1eef> indeed, i think that too, theyre both as capable as each other.
[07:01:09] <nakilon> anyway, I've fully switched from pithon 9 years ago and don't wanna waste 90% of time again on solving the errors that are happening due to the bad language design and tooling
[07:02:49] <ox1eef> another cool thing written in python is youtube-dl
