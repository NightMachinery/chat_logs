[11:00:51] *** Joins: s-liao (~s-liao@101.86.101.64)
[11:01:16] <sham1> I mean, to get more standards compliant you just need to adapt the metacircular evaluator to be more standard
[11:04:58] <amazigh> ns12: what is your overall goal? I mean you look for a project? a timesink? or you want to contribute to SRFI / RnRS? or you want to be an expert of Scheme implementations?
[11:06:10] <amazigh> fwiw, I a building chez-scheme-ruse because I can't find something that works (for me, and I tried many alternatives gambit, schism, biwascheme, chibi)
[11:06:45] <sjamaan> amazigh: What do you mean by "works"?
[11:07:30] <ns12> amazigh: The goal is to make a standards compliant R7RS interpreter, to know how it could be implemented.
[11:07:40] <amazigh> I like the post on srfi-discuss, if you just build a scheme implementation, it is more like a pilgrimage (the road is more interesting than the result that you may never achieve), ref: https://srfi-email.schemers.org/srfi-discuss/msg/17119469/
[11:08:49] <amazigh> sjamaan: gambit is still unstable, chibi wasm build is way too big payload, schism can't interop with JavaScript, biwascheme is buggy for some reason.
[11:09:07] <amazigh> sjamaan: re biwascheme: https://groups.google.com/g/biwascheme/c/6zAvChMEj7E
[11:09:34] <sjamaan> amazigh: Have you checked out SPOCK?
[11:09:58] <amazigh> sjamaan: no
[11:10:09] <amazigh> but I prefer not to depend on two scheme implementation.
[11:10:36] <amazigh> I mean that's is another reason to not use gambit. I will give a quick glimpse at spock.

[11:58:05] <ecraven> we should come up with a better name than "ecraven's benchmarks"...
[11:58:34] <amazigh> yes. but that is a good occasion to say hello :D
[11:59:53] <ecraven> what I would *love* to make (but haven't found the time for) is a qualitative comparison of Schemes.. so not just quantitative numbers, but actual *features*
[12:00:09] <ecraven> because chez might be fast, but it sure doesn't have all the features that other implementations have (at least out of the box)
[12:01:24] *** Joins: notzmv (~zmv@user/notzmv)
[12:06:24] <mdhughes> Chez is more batteries-included than most Schemes. It's just not at CL levels (or Gerbil, except Chez has docs).
[12:06:49] <mdhughes> Or CHICKEN, but then you're in R5+=2 land, and half the adventure is finding out what doesn't work.
[12:07:09] <mdhughes> So Chez's a nice ground to build your own stuff on, which is more fun.

[12:09:51] <sham1> Like does it have any support
[12:09:53] <mdhughes> It's not. It's R6RS.
[12:10:13] <sham1> Ah
[12:10:28] <amazigh> sham1: I have R7RS libraries, but not R7RS define-library form, look into arcfide chez-srfi project on github
[12:10:31] <mdhughes> Now, most of the SRFIs work on anything R5 or later, and there's things like Thunderchez that collect SRFIs and other libraries.
[12:10:39] <amazigh> https://github.com/arcfide/chez-srfi/
[12:11:05] <amazigh> yes there is also thunderchez.
[12:11:14] <mdhughes> I've been moving a large project from CHICKEN to Chez, and 90%+ of the code is compatible. The last 10% was a pain.

[12:12:27] <mdhughes> Really where the versions get you is: Records are much more powerful and easier to use in R6. Macros can be more powerful in R6, but mostly you use simpler syntax-rules in both.
[12:13:25] <mdhughes> Hashtables are defined in R6, and are library/impl-specific in R7.
[12:13:49] <mdhughes> I/O and Unicode are defined in R6, and are not in R7, which is a massive pain in the ass.
[12:14:40] <mdhughes> But CHICKEN has some crazy additions that are nice to have, like DSSSL keywords.
