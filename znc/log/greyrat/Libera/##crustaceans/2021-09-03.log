[01:25:25] <manicennui> Why do these idiots think blockchain does any of this?
[01:25:33] <riv> I think it's because they are idiots
[01:25:51] <riv> they probably have no idea what a blockchain is except some kind of magic computer thing
[01:26:17] <manicennui> The problem you want to solve is a source data problem if there even is a problem. Blockchain can’t do anything about people lying
[01:26:19] <riv> (or smart evil people are just pretending that enough idiots believe this until regular people just accept it)
[01:27:06] <manicennui> I think they must all believe that the big problem is people changing records fraudulently
[01:27:40] <indigo> https://xkcd.com/538/
[01:27:41] <buttsbot> xkcd: Security
[01:28:08] <manicennui> Companies would just enter the fraudulent data to start with
[01:28:21] <indigo> But if it's on the blockchain, it must be true!
[01:28:46] <manicennui> And since I assume they control these chains anyways, they could just rewrite transactions
[01:29:27] <indigo> Well they have to. Sometimes you need to change the truth
[01:34:38] <manicennui> We need an easy to follow rule for these idiots: don’t use blockchain to attempt to fix physical world problems

[01:40:57] <Brekkjern> Actually...
[01:41:01] <Brekkjern> Scratch that last one
[01:44:37] <dimadima> DJT made a statement on crypto the other day
[01:45:03] <dimadima> "They may be fake. Who knows what they are?" he said in the Tuesday interview. "They certainly are something that people don't know very much about. I have not been a big fan."
[01:46:13] <manicennui> He should have created his own and used his cult to pump it up
[01:46:46] <riv> actually
[01:46:47] <riv> why didn't he?
[01:47:00] <dimadima> he's a limited savant
[01:47:06] <dimadima> not all genius comes to come, just some
[01:47:10] <dimadima> comes to him*
[01:49:23] <dimadima> though who am i to talk, i don't have a cult, muchless what might be the largest cult in human history
[01:49:43] <dimadima> that blockchain olive oil
[01:50:03] <indigo> Why does he need to create a blockchain when he can just grift his supporters using campaign donations?
[01:50:08] <indigo> Pragmatic savant
[01:51:09] <dimadima> this is true he really can pick and choose his grift now
[01:51:20] <manicennui> dimadima: Islam is obviously the largest cult in history

[01:53:58] <manicennui> Although if you break them all down by sect things would look a bit different
[01:54:12] <Brekkjern> Nah. We had to spread Christianity around the globe by colonialism
[01:55:20] <dimadima> islam is way less cool in my mind now
[01:56:06] <dimadima> spanish is still the #1 language right?

[01:58:31] <manicennui> Are Mormons Christians?
[01:58:42] <dimadima> i believe they would say so yes

[01:58:59] <dimadima> Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints
[01:59:16] <manicennui> An even more crazy version of Jesus
[01:59:47] <dimadima> yeah got to love religions that are like < 200 years old

[02:01:01] <manicennui> Are Satanist Christians?
[02:01:13] <manicennui> Satanists
[02:01:29] <dimadima> that is a really interesting question
[02:01:46] <manicennui> Which version of Satan do they believe in?
[02:01:47] <dimadima> they would probably say they're not, but how can you be a satanist without christianity
[02:02:18] <manicennui> I know that the one group doesn’t actually worship Satan
[02:02:21] <dimadima> the south park version most commonly i beliee
[02:03:33] <dimadima> "chriisssss"
[02:04:29] <manicennui> I dated a woman who claimed to be Christian in her online profile because that is how she was raised, but didn’t actually believe
[02:04:41] <manicennui> I think that is common in the US
[02:07:38] <dimadima> i bet. if you're not anti-religion you probably just say how you were raised

[02:20:15] <manicennui> Airbnb in the mountains
[02:20:31] <dasm> sounds slightly better than hotel room

[02:22:44] <dasm> You watch Ads on demand
[02:22:46] <kline> probably not
[02:23:00] <kline> but remember, just believing in jesus and the abrahamic canon doesnt mean you're a christian
[02:23:15] <kline> islam also acknowledges jesus as a divine prophet
[02:23:25] <manicennui> Blockchain ads
[02:23:34] <kline> just not a godsent saviour
[02:23:51] <dasm> manicennui: you use your GPU to see more ads? Savage!
[02:23:52] <kline> and tbh not even the most important prophet
[02:24:08] <manicennui> God sent himself to seek forgiveness from himself!
[02:24:31] <kline> look, it doesnt have to make sense
[02:24:56] <manicennui> For things he allowed us to do by his own design
[02:25:37] <dimadima> as someone who struggles groking christianity, i read a pretty good explanation the other month
[02:25:40] <dimadima> got to find it
[02:25:41] <kline> are you saying we're not allowed to get mad at people who drink and drive?
[02:25:54] <kline> thats purely by our own design, that such a thing can happen
[02:26:43] <manicennui> We didn’t create ourselves
[02:27:06] <manicennui> And we aren’t omniscient and omnipotent
[02:28:18] <kline> we know enough to know that drinking alcohol and driving is bad, and that we provide all the tools to people to do that
[02:29:14] <manicennui> We didn’t create the processes that create alcohol.
[02:29:20] <kline> just to be clear, im not here to apologise for christianity, i dont even hold the faith, but i do think its kind of weird to blame god for our flaws in a book that mentions big donkey ejaculations
[02:29:57] <manicennui> I don’t blame imaginary beings for our problems
[02:30:10] <kline> remember: the whole story about the donkey on the road meeting the angel was probably just a bored scribe whos self-amusement scrap accidentally got into the "to be copied" pile
[02:30:20] <manicennui> I’m saying that the story of Jesus is dumb
[02:30:48] <kline> no one disagrees, but trying to pick holes in the axioms isnt actually all that helpful, theyre taken to be axiomatic
[02:31:21] <manicennui> The Abrahamic religions have set humanity back by thousands of years
[02:31:28] <dimadima> found it: http://www.nateeag.com/christianity/
[02:31:28] <buttsbot> What I Believe
[02:31:44] <dimadima> came across this person via hacker news
[02:31:55] <dimadima> "I believe the Maker of the universe loves me so much that He died to save me from myself."
[02:32:52] <dimadima> i guess the axioms there are still hard to grok
[02:32:56] <dimadima> why does anyone need to die to save anyone
[02:33:32] <kline> because the act of dying can cleanse sin
[02:34:05] <dimadima> and why is that?
[02:34:13] <manicennui> The only Christian writings that make much sense were written by men who stole bits of Greek philosophy
[02:35:05] <dimadima> and is it anyone dying to god dying?
[02:36:27] <dimadima> "to save me from myself"
[02:36:29] <manicennui> The whole problem with the Abrahamic religions is that at their core they are about authority and obedience
[02:36:37] <dimadima> i guess now that i'm reading it again it's like no this makes no sense to me
[02:37:10] <dimadima> manicennui: sounds like a feature to me ;)
[02:37:10] <manicennui> And the people who currently run the various sects put themselves in the position of authority
[02:37:45] <kline> dimadima, the idea is that jesus basically came down as a big sin-sponge and loved us so much he taken our sin as his own and died and released us from the various inborn sin we accumulated in the old testament
[02:37:46] <manicennui> That their foundational texts don’t make sense is a benefit to them
[02:38:10] <kline> dimadima, this is why christians are free of many of the deals with god that jews maintain
[02:39:43] <dimadima> kline:  thank you. i will copy that and review it periodically
[02:40:09] <dimadima> i'm guessing you just have to sort of dig it, too
[02:40:19] <kline> dimadima, https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%209%3A22&version=NIV
[02:40:20] <buttsbot> Hebrews 9:22 NIV - In fact, the law requires that nearly - Bible Gateway

[02:40:24] <buttsbot> 2 Corinthians 5:21 NIV - God made him who had no sin to be sin - Bible Gateway
[02:41:11] <dimadima> woah that hebrews quote
[02:42:05] <manicennui> It doesn’t help that many different words are translated to a single word in English, like sin.
[02:42:14] <companion_cube> manicennui: in a way I find it kind of nice that the new testament is hippie-ish
[02:42:19] <companion_cube> it's not a common thing in antiquity
[02:42:44] <manicennui> companion_cube: How so?
[02:42:55] <kline> manicennui, yeah, the start of the NIV iirc has a big foreword basically saying, for example, theres half a dozen ways to refer to G/god and they all probably have subtly different meanings
[02:42:58] <Brekkjern> This is the best part of the bible: http://bash.org/?178890
[02:42:58] <buttsbot> QDB: Quote #178890
[02:43:02] <kline> then we just come along and say "God"
[02:43:32] <kline> (or sometimes god, or sometimes, Lᴏʀᴅ)
[02:45:27] <manicennui> The Transcendentalists had the best take on Christianity
[02:46:06] <kline> dimadima, bear in mind that "To the Hebrews" is a book written for christians that interprets the old testament jewish bits in a contemporary jewish culture
[02:46:20] <kline> so there are four different lenses involved there
[02:48:02] <dimadima> thanks kline. i really want to get into the NT sometime
[02:48:18] <dimadima> i watched/listend to this a while back https://oyc.yale.edu/religious-studies/rlst-145

[02:48:25] <kline> cool
[02:48:30] <kline> i might do that

[02:48:35] <buttsbot> Introduction to the New Testament History and Literature -  | Open Yale Courses
[02:48:47] <dimadima> and didn't get past the first few classes
[02:48:47] <kline> im about 3/4s through the old testament and taken a bit of a detour via the NT
[02:49:10] <dimadima> how are you reading it?
[02:49:15] <manicennui> It’s all just useless. Nothing more than a giant system of control. The Abrahamic religions are not interested in understanding the world. They want to control it while remaining ignorant
[02:49:48] <kline> a lot of the ot is the necessary geneaology to set out why jews #1 (and more importantly, the clerical class in jewish societies as #1 of #1)
[02:50:04] <kline> manicennui, definitely a little of column a and a little of column b
[02:50:42] <manicennui> The Christians realized that they could gain far more cult members by removing a bunch of the requirements of the OT.
[02:50:48] <kline> like i said, a lot of the old testament is just the clerical class of jews writing into the books that they have to pay no tax, etc
[02:51:08] <manicennui> And a different group of people could gain control
[02:52:07] <dimadima> there's definitely a lot of authority and contol going on but my feeling has been that there's a lot of trying to understand the world and exitence as well
[02:52:10] <kline> i think you're perhaps a little cynical, a lot of people do find genuine, sincere comfort in their faith and express net-positive actions from it
[02:52:15] <manicennui> Then. Christianity fractured into east and west with different rules and people in conflict control
[02:52:23] <dimadima> christine hayes breaks that down a lot in https://oyc.yale.edu/religious-studies/rlst-145
[02:52:24] <buttsbot> Introduction to the Old Testament (Hebrew Bible) -  | Open Yale Courses
[02:52:24] <manicennui> And later Luther, etc
[02:52:37] <manicennui> It’s all bullshit
[02:53:56] <kline> honestly the real take is to read and understand a bunch of stuff, find which one resonates with you the most, and if you feel like it is convincing, live your life in the spirit of the text rather than modern organised versions of it
[02:54:26] <dimadima> sounds very protestant :)
[02:54:30] <kline> theres a lot of value to living by "christian ideals" without having to give money to megachurches, or partake in someone elses projection of their opinion of it onto, say, gay marriage
[02:54:54] <manicennui> I have studied a bunch of it. It does not provide a guide for living well at all.
[02:54:55] <bkero> lol
[02:54:57] <kline> my dads a christian and just outright said "jesus forgave the prostitutes etc why wouldnt he want gay people to be happy too"
[02:55:24] <kline> specifically, this was in the context of the UK removing the law forbidding churches from gay marriage
[02:55:34] <manicennui> The few bits that seem wise were stolen from elsewhere and don’t form any kind of coherent system
[02:56:31] <manicennui> kline: Christians getting over their only bigotry is not a good reason to be Christian.
[02:56:56] <kline> i never said that
[02:57:08] <manicennui> Not going to join the Klan if a few of them realize that racism is wrong
[02:57:27] <kline> i said if you find that christianity gives you comfort then people ought to practice it their way
[02:57:33] <kline> err
[02:57:41] <kline> mixed tense or whatever there, mixed subject?
[02:57:56] <kline> if one finds christianity to be comforting, take the best of it, practice it the way one wants, and live a good life
[02:57:58] <manicennui> People should study better texts
[02:58:02] <kline> such as?
[02:58:36] <bkero> Taking the best of religions and the combining it with other philosphies leads to a system that is usually not internally consistent
[02:58:52] <kline> bkero, i mean, youre basically talking bahai
[02:58:57] <manicennui> Greek philosophers. Many eastern philosophies
[02:59:33] <manicennui> bkero: They didn’t combine the best of various philosophies
[03:00:23] <manicennui> They combined the whims of various religious leaders who controlled each sect at various times
[03:00:32] <bkero> Taking "the good parts of christianity" is how we end up with Modern American Bad Christians
[03:01:23] <kline> manicennui, is the recent uptake and debasement of greek philosophy by the alt-right any different from the debasement of what could be positive christian ideals practiced the right way? the alt-right taking stoicism and turning it into MGTOW/incel culture doesnt invalidate what we can draw from those who teach us to roll with the punches and accept what we find ourselves with
[03:02:33] <kline> people are always going to seek to recast positive (or at least, comforting) belief systems that have followers in order to try and bend those followers to their personal will
[03:02:48] <bkero> lol buffet spirituality
[03:02:50] <kline> i dont think this undermines that these underlying belief systems can be used for good
[03:02:57] <manicennui> If you want to see what it looks like when you attempt to take the good and/or common aspects of various religions and philosophies, take a look at Perennial Philosophy
[03:04:05] <manicennui> kline: It really doesn’t matter who takes it up and “debases” it. There is no stoic authority to upset.
[03:04:27] <manicennui> Read the works and figure out what works
[03:05:09] <manicennui> There is simply nothing to learn from Christianity other than really trivial and superficial lessons.
[03:05:21] <manicennui> And far more bad shit to learn
[03:05:48] <kline> manicennui | Read the works and figure out what works
[03:05:51] <bkero> There's ways for religion to ignore, downplay, and dodge their way in world wars
[03:06:05] <manicennui> I’m not worried about people reading stoic texts and adopting their explanation of how physics and such
[03:06:05] <kline> im glad we agree, im just saying it can be expansive
[03:06:13] <bkero> I bet there's useful information to be gleaned from that, but it's likely like Carnegie's advice: only good if you're in Dale Fucking Carnegie
[03:06:37] <manicennui> kline: We don’t agree.
[03:07:24] <manicennui> The only Christian writing I would recommend anyone read is little more than Platonism or Aristotilianism
[03:08:15] <manicennui> Usually Aquinas interpreted by another source
[03:09:14] <manicennui> kline: Faith as an axiom is fundamentally bad.
[03:09:26] <manicennui> There is no way around it.
[03:09:52] <manicennui> But Christianity is the perfect religion for Americans
[03:10:01] <kline> thank god im not american
[03:10:32] <manicennui> Religious leaders can control a bunch of idiots to do their bidding and fall back on Faith
[03:11:06] <manicennui> And the fundamental reliance on authority
[03:11:52] <dimadima> i'm not particularly old but my impression in life thus far has been then whether authority is religious or secular, the mass-control of idiots is about the same
[03:11:58] <manicennui> And the lessons are superficial and cannot be explained because they aren’t based on anything
[03:13:19] <manicennui> dimadima: It’s far more effective when you indoctrinate children from a young age and claim that the consequences are things that no one can verify
[03:13:23] <dimadima> i don't think getting rid of religion is going to get rid of mass idiocy or deployment therefor
[03:13:26] <dimadima> thereof*
[03:13:34] <kline> same
[03:13:37] <dimadima> manicennui: i don't agree with that...
[03:13:37] <manicennui> Never claimed that
[03:13:48] <dimadima> i mean, that it's much more effective
[03:13:59] <kline> celebrity, money, any other ingroup/outgroup system
[03:14:00] <kline> etc
[03:14:18] <dimadima> 0.01% of humanity is trying to verify this or that
[03:14:27] <dimadima> most ppl are just trying to get by and chill to the fullset
[03:14:39] <manicennui> But supposedly smart people can stop pretending as though reading Abrahamic texts is a good way to learn how to live well or be a good person
[03:14:45] <dimadima> i'm not saying that as a morally good bad thing, that's just the impression i've got
[03:15:09] <dimadima> living well and being a good person are subjective thouhg?
[03:15:26] <dimadima> are you saying there is an objective living well or being good?
[03:16:32] <manicennui> dimadima: I think you are grossly underestimating how effective indoctrination of Children is. There is a reason why people who were raised Catholic but no longer believe still talk about Catholic guilt
[03:18:01] <dimadima> i don't think i am. for one thing, i experienced it personally. but i've also seen general cultural indoctrination and i think it's generally as effective
[03:18:19] <manicennui> dimadima: I’m saying for common definitions of what people mean by things like contentment or happiness, there are better and worse ways to try to obtain it
[03:18:54] <dimadima> my impression has been that it varies a lot from person to person
[03:19:02] <dimadima> material stability helps, but to a certain point
[03:19:10] <kline> dimadima, generally "bad" people are going to drive for power always, religion is just one way. its good because people are inherently fearful/curious about what happens "after" etc
[03:19:21] <manicennui> Of course you can decide that the only thing that brings you fulfillment is mass murder
[03:19:31] <kline> but yeah, personal power by being well-regarded in ingroups etc is just as effective, and we see that culturally
[03:19:37] <dimadima> kline: that's my take, too.
[03:20:04] <dimadima> manicennui: yeah those ppl exist
[03:20:06] <kline> the need to be seen to do the right thing by the right people, and worse, the fear of the right people believing that youve been seen to do the wrong thing
[03:20:49] <manicennui> Most Christians are just as dissatisfied as the rest of us. Which is why they vote for conmen like Trump who promise to fix their problems
[03:21:11] <kline> most christians practice in name only
[03:21:21] <dimadima> took the word out of my mouth
[03:21:28] <kline> most christians dont read or understand or practice christian ideals
[03:21:33] <manicennui> They have not found an effective system for living a good life
[03:21:35] <dimadima> i would argue that religion in the USA is pretty dead
[03:21:40] <dimadima> trump => religion
[03:22:02] <kline> they are just under the thumb of another power groups influence, with religious identity as the pillar
[03:22:12] <kline> and tbh its far more about identity than anything else
[03:22:48] <manicennui> kline: There was no point since the founding of the Church that this hasn’t been the case
[03:22:56] <dimadima> neil postman describes the state of american culture really wll i think in the chapter called "smybol drain" in "technopolgy"
[03:23:17] <dimadima> american culture has been reduced to symbology, but has otherwise been sucked of all substance
[03:23:20] <kline> for example, im pretty sure the old testament even includes temple sanctioned abortions somewhere
[03:23:22] <dimadima> religion (christianity included)
[03:23:52] <manicennui> Many of Postman’s beliefs line up well with the core of Buddhism
[03:23:59] <kline> manicennui, thankfully, christianity has existed before the bringing about of the organised "practice" via the church
[03:24:31] <kline> so ill maintain that christian belief is not synonymous with organised christian church power circles
[03:24:35] <manicennui> kline: Next to nothing is known about that period of its history
[03:24:40] <kline> ok
[03:24:54] <manicennui> We have only the bullshit in the Gospels
[03:25:10] <manicennui> Written a century later in some cases
[03:26:15] <manicennui> And which of the Gospels should we take as canon?
[03:26:18] <dimadima> (i meant to write "technopology" earlier)
[03:26:27] <dimadima> fuck! "technopoly"
[03:26:36] <manicennui> Which Ecumenical Council rulings?
[03:26:47] <manicennui> Which translation?
[03:26:56] <kline> my point is that none of these really matter
[03:27:10] <kline> you dont need a church to tell you how to live your life
[03:27:18] <kline> indeed, doing so is probably counterproductive
[03:28:06] <kline> ill agree, organised religion is generally a sham
[03:28:14] <kline> that doesnt mean theres not good to be found in the bible
[03:28:40] <manicennui> They do though. You are almost certainly referring to a specific set of the Gospels, interpreted through a specific viewpoint, translated by people with an agenda, and there is still nothing deep ther.
[03:28:44] <manicennui> There
[03:29:42] <kline> this applies to all of human knowledge
[03:29:59] <kline> its all written by people, interpreted and shared through the lens of motivated individuals and structures
[03:30:13] <manicennui> It’s a bunch of superficial nonsense that always falls back on Faith, which just means obey some authority
[03:30:43] <manicennui> kline: Some knowledge isn’t a complete waste of time though
[03:33:13] <kline> pretty much every religion expresses the virtue in charity
[03:33:31] <kline> charity, especially in this day, certainly isnt a waste in time
[03:33:44] <manicennui> Read a secondary or even tertiary work on stoicism or buddhism and you’ll gain more useful knowledge than you ever will from reading the Bible.
[03:34:25] <manicennui> kline: The missing piece I Christianity is why.
[03:34:36] <kline> manicennui, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism_and_violence
[03:34:36] <buttsbot> Buddhism and violence - Wikipedia
[03:34:57] <kline> buddhism is just as debased in practice as christianity is
[03:35:13] <kline> for example: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodu_Bala_Sena
[03:35:13] <buttsbot> Bodu Bala Sena - Wikipedia
[03:35:23] <manicennui> Christianity’s answer boils down to pity or because god said so
[03:35:37] <manicennui> kline: We aren’t discussing practice
[03:36:00] <manicennui> There is nothing to learn about charity Friday m the Bible
[03:36:33] <kline> maybe we're at the core of the issue then, because my entire point all along has been to reject top down organisation and find comfort in and practice the interpretation of any religion, christianity included, that resonates with you
[03:36:42] <manicennui> You will either get stories where you are supposed to pity the less fortunate or Jesus commands you to do it
[03:37:34] <manicennui> kline: I still don’t think you are getting it though. There is nothing deeper to find a n the Bible
[03:37:43] <manicennui> It isn’t actually deep
[03:38:17] <kline> im sure in some parallel discussion people are talking about the debasement of buddhism along the border of india and pakistan and wishing that people reject buddhism "just because you need to buy karma for the next life" and instead look to christianity for a set of beliefs that strives to practice well to reach a higher plane
[03:38:20] <manicennui> You can certainly read all kinds of things into it that you likely learned from modern culture
[03:45:27] <manicennui> kline: Let’s put this another way to make it clearer. You can take the primary texts from each of these religions and read them. With the Bible you end up with mostly nonsense and a few superficial lessons, mostly for the wrong reasons. The fundamental tenet is Faith, aka submission to authority. With Buddhism, you get maybe 50% nonsense, and a bunch of really deep lessons. The fundamental tenets of Buddhism include,
[03:45:27] <manicennui> among other things, practice and determining whether these things are true for yourself
[03:46:20] <manicennui> The Buddha does not say that his word is final and there is nothing more to learn
[03:46:47] <manicennui> He explains how he achieved what he did
[03:47:31] <manicennui> In both cases I would not spend time with primary texts, especially when starting out
[03:47:52] <manicennui> I would not even recommend secondary texts generally
[03:49:07] <manicennui> For Christianity the best writings are generally Catholic, and you could do a lot worse than Josef Pieper
[03:50:11] <manicennui> But you will find that he is basically a Platonism and relies heavily on Aquinas.
[03:50:45] <manicennui> For Buddhism there are tons of great works from monks and lay people
[03:51:55] <manicennui> There are a handful of decent overviews of Stoicism that skip the physics and such
[03:52:52] <manicennui> Biggest problem with Stoicism being that it was basically a dead philosophy for a long time other than influencing others
[03:53:18] <manicennui> Not really a large group of practitioners for the last couple thousand years
[03:54:27] <manicennui> But I’d recommend one of the books on Perennial Philosophy over the Christian works. You will get the same lessons with less reliance o Faith

[05:37:23] <prussian> It came out awhile ago. As in monthz
[05:37:26] <prussian> Months
[05:38:59] <manicennui> prussian: Internet sucks here and streaming video is difficult to watch. Is it because of the cleaning process mentioned in the article?
[05:40:01] <prussian> Seems to be a multitude of factors ranging from some data analytics company, to bad UX on the machine's side and a real nice service and parts grift.
[05:40:33] <prussian> Combined with the generic inaction or seemingly protection racket that McDonald's is forcing on its franchisees
[05:40:59] <prussian> Because of the whole bad ux, seemingly endless servicing, etc.
[05:41:23] <prussian> And we'll the fact that only one specific machine to the model number can be bought solely for ice cream
[05:41:33] <manicennui> I just don’t understand why people want to eat their “ice cream “
[05:42:06] <manicennui> Also don’t understand Dairy Queen
[05:42:29] <prussian> 🤷
[05:42:57] <manicennui> Liked both as a child, but I’ve had much better ice cream since and haven’t eaten either in probably 20 years
[05:43:55] <prussian> Anyhow
[05:44:15] <prussian> Good watch imo. I see a lot of parallels happening in the gas station industry
[05:44:32] <prussian> But we don't quite have the franchisee model to really lock people in
[05:44:52] <manicennui> I kind of hope several fast food chains go under
[05:44:54] <prussian> Well, I guess in the US the gas station / c-store franchises do?
[05:44:59] <prussian> True...
[05:45:06] <prussian> Nasty business in a fairness
[05:45:08] <prussian> Unfortunately
[05:45:25] <prussian> Last time I went to McDonald's, I basically got a egg sandwich
[05:45:37] <prussian> I can't imagine how they can make that unhealthy
[05:45:56] <prussian> Well, with no cheese, but they always fuck up your order somehow.
[05:46:09] <manicennui> It probably has 45 ingredients

[05:52:48] <manicennui> They rely heavily on the sauce
[05:52:52] <bkero> Yeah it's not my cup of tea. I prefer my barbecue more brisket shaped with less sauce.

[06:19:05] <manicennui> Sure, it’s the French brigade method
[06:20:36] <manicennui> He learned it from Marco Pierre White
[06:22:53] <manicennui> I think Eric Rupert has talked about specifically running his kitchen differently because he did not want it to be like a lot of French brigade kitchens
[06:24:40] <manicennui> “I asked Ripert, who had trained in the quasi-militarized kitchen hierarchy called the brigade, whether he too was an angry chef. He paused for a moment then said, “I was. But like I tell my son, ‘No one is happy to be angry.’” Anger is a sign of weakness, not of strength, he told me. This was among the tranche of realizations he said he had had since discovering the Buddhist path 20 years prior.”

[06:32:58] <manicennui> Marco Pierre White (born 11 December 1961)[2] is a British chef, restaurateur, and television personality.[3] He has been dubbed the first celebrity chef,[3] and the enfant terrible[4] of the UK restaurant scene
[06:33:26] <manicennui> In 1994, at age 32, White became the first British chef to be awarded three Michelin stars.[5]
[06:36:17] <manicennui> It’s like giving an asshole like Trump an asshole grifter for a father.
[06:36:49] <manicennui> It’s possible he would have been insufferable no matter what, but perhaps far less so.
[06:38:38] <prussian> Rip. Didn't his step dad fuck him over or some stupid shit too?
[06:38:54] <prussian> Anyhow. Time to sleep.
[06:46:21] <manicennui> Damn. Crouching Tiger was released 21 years ago. The lead actress is 42 now.

[17:05:16] <prussian> >>13597624
[17:05:16] <prussian> not really. if we're gonna waste a bunch of time making up hot takes I think it more likely comes down to factors around second market control: corporations want bigger profits so it is not enough to just sell a product, you have to control the entire ecosystem around the product.
[17:05:16] <prussian> Why should petroleum monitoring companies allow "disruptors" to have real-time dispensing and tank volume data when they can gate keep it in secret and hardware attested security? Please buy our SaaS platform instead. Why do tractor companies want to give farmers the power to choose which servicing, parts, automation or predictive maintenance monitoring solutions when they can use their power to
[17:05:16] <prussian> capture second markets with their own in-house software?
[17:05:19] <prussian> oops

[17:30:56] <prussian> ugh
[17:32:20] <riv> 3 day weekend \o/
[17:32:45] <prussian> this. I am hyped.
[17:32:48] <prussian> good weather too.
[17:33:02] <prussian> but I'm not sure tech wise what I'm gonna do.
[17:43:57] <riv> if im feeling up to it I will do some more of my book about entropy this weekend
[17:44:15] <riv> was really enjoying that before my brain overheated
[17:50:05] <bontaq> sounds like a fun project, like working through it or writing a book on it?
[17:58:54] <riv> just working through it
[18:10:32] <prussian> people at work demand I teach them how to shell...
[18:10:57] <prussian> https://gist.github.com/adedomin/3fd1243fda66aefd073654e319cf8530 <- should I turn this into a blog post? lol.
[18:10:57] <buttsbot> bash-training.sh · GitHub
[18:11:38] <riv> skimming.. that looks genuinely really useful. if you can be bothered then yeah
[18:11:58] <prussian> it's not complete sadly.
[18:12:02] <prussian> so much to cover.
[18:12:10] <prussian> or I can tell people "shell bad"
[18:26:30] <bontaq> yeah that's handy stuff, it'd be nice to know some more bash
[18:26:57] <prussian> writing is such a hassle. I'll look into it.
[18:27:07] <prussian> I need to setup a blog on my site then lol.
[18:29:56] <Xe> prussian: yes
[18:31:15] <prussian> zsh is so much cooler-er though -_-
[18:32:20] <companion_cube> teach them how to fish
[18:33:03] <gwozniak> Is there a compelling reason to switch to fish if you alreadyk know bash/zsh pretty well?
[18:33:52] <prussian> well it claims to be the shell the 90s always wanted?
[18:34:07] <gwozniak> Doesn't sound very compelling ;)
[18:34:24] <prussian> i can ask a friend of mine I guess.
[18:34:36] <prussian> I have been onboard the zsh train for some time.
[18:34:51] <prussian> x=(1 2 3); y=3; print -r -- --cool=$^x{1..$y} # beat *THAT* bash
[18:35:34] <gwozniak> I know shell reasonably well and I'm used to it.  If fish is "cleaner", that's weak sauce
[18:35:46] <prussian> unfortunately same as ^
[18:35:56] <prussian> zsh is "mostly" ksh/bash like.
[18:36:03] <prussian> so it's relatively drop-in
[18:36:12] <gwozniak> I've been using zsh for about 20 years now
[18:36:21] <prussian> the future, today.
[18:36:29] <prussian> nice
[18:36:35] <prussian> you have me beat.
[18:36:45] <gwozniak> I don't program in it much, though
[18:36:59] <prussian> most of the programming is just my .zshrc

[21:11:24] <gwozniak> ``fff is “a simple file manager written in Bash”''
[21:11:35] <gwozniak> why
[21:11:58] <riv> navigate into a directory with a space in the filename, watch fff go up in flames
[21:13:38] <companion_cube> kind of hoped it'd be named "ffs"
[21:14:33] <gerikson> fuck found files
[21:16:25] <gwozniak> riv: better yet, a newline
[21:20:10] <gerikson> if we unilaterally declared that newlines in filenames were now forbidden by POSIX, what would be lost?

[21:21:36] <prussian> it seems to be pretty smart

[21:24:05] <gwozniak> prussian: if you quote properly in shell, you're generally fine
[21:24:08] <gerikson> BUT POSIX
[21:24:20] <gwozniak> but muh POSIX
[21:24:31] <prussian> i mean. it definitely handles it correctly as far as I can see.
[21:27:00] <prussian> only complaint I have is the color choices of fff clash with light terminals
[21:28:55] <prussian> POOSIX*
[21:28:57] <prussian> by the way
