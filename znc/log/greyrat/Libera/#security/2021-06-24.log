[05:48:25] <lind{at}yahoo> I had to resort back to phreaking and I got really fucking good at it
[05:50:45] <lind{at}yahoo> so I started my adventure into network hacking the DoD without Internet access at calling 703-555-1212 and asking for the Pentagon Switchboard to which they were happy to provide 703-545-6700
[05:51:50] <lind{at}yahoo> I just called around asking for high level accounts they woul never provide me, but I got to know their opers and finally they directed me to Cyberspace Transformation which turned out to be a direct line to Captain Joshua Sanders, USN
[05:53:11] <calmclam> I bet he's glad he's not in another armed service at that rank
[05:53:37] <lind{at}yahoo> https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshua-sanders-520b4536/
[05:54:11] <mats1> any relation to colonel sanders?
[05:54:16] <lind{at}yahoo> I was actually snail mail hacking the NSA at the same time
[05:54:46] <lind{at}yahoo> I wrote letters, classified NATO-NA CODEWORD `CODEWORD` to Paul M. Nakasone
[05:55:33] <calmclam> They're getting lazy with their codewords
[05:55:56] <lind{at}yahoo> well eventually CBRE started sending them back, opened and sealed back up - often with pages in a different order, and an x in sharpire through his address and a return to sender to me
[05:57:20] <lind{at}yahoo> I'd address it "The Pentagon, c/o Gen. Paul M. Nakasone, USA (Paul.M.Nakasone.mil@mail.mil); 1400 Defense Pentagon; Washington DC 20301
[05:57:25] <lind{at}yahoo> I think that zip is right

[06:24:00] <TimMc> I've kind of come to this position where I'll recommend it for anyone who seems super clueless, but not for people who I think maybe won't open random attachments.
[06:24:49] <flyback> anything but McCOCKfleas or SNORTIN
[06:25:05] <calmclam> everyone opens random attachments
[06:25:28] <flyback> you gotta admit even people with a security background, some of the fishing is pretty clever
[06:26:06] <s0ph0s> I recommend Windows Defender and an ad blocking browser extension
[06:26:09] <flyback> i've been fortunite I only fell for one once that resultedi n me having a 2nd linked lin account
[06:26:30] <s0ph0s> Because Defender, with the live protection features all turned on, is actually quite good
[06:26:35] <flyback> s0ph0s, I recommend noscript or scriptsafe for browsers even though it's a pain
[06:26:47] <flyback> I love when sites freak the fuck out
[06:26:50] <flyback> DON'T YOU DO IT
[06:26:55] <flyback> DON'T YOU RUN NOSCRIPT!
[06:27:03] * flyback does his best mst3k impersination
[06:27:20] <s0ph0s> flyback: Specifically in the context of random relatives and such, I can’t tell them to use noscript because that would be such a huge problem
[06:27:34] <flyback> yeah I had to disable it on my folks pc's
[06:27:37] <flyback> unfortunitely
[06:27:54] <flyback> fortunitely once I get this nas up I wil have automated backup protection for them both
[06:28:08] <flyback> in addition to hosting my project files
[06:29:06] <flyback> another browser addon I highly recommend but not related to security is h264ify
[06:29:16] <calmclam> whitelist facebook and block everything else and they'll probably thank you since noscript will bypass a lot of news site interstitials
[06:29:19] <flyback> it forces youtube to use the older h264 codec and disables 60 fps video
[06:29:29] <flyback> if you have a older rig you are keeping around it makes it useable
[06:29:42] <flyback> even late model core2chipsets have a h264 hw decoder
[06:30:31] <flyback> yeah you lose some of the super high reses but you can't run those anyways

[06:39:04] <flyback> of course lee's fucking over freenode and deleting the user database makes finding lost irc souls a lot harder

[06:40:08] <flyback> I learned a lot about data recovery and forensic tools in the process
[06:40:18] <Aph3x-WL> he's giving out free irc money from his "trillionaire" friends so it's cool

[06:41:24] <flyback> b) give notice for a month that the user database was going away
[06:41:28] <calmclam> people tend to use the same nicks nowadays

[07:00:00] <TimMc> Really seems like he's throwing spaghetti at the wall at this point.
[07:00:05] <flyback> it's funny to listen to him whine about cancel culture when he started this shit by autobanning anyone who mentioned they were moving in the topic
[07:00:25] <flyback> Aph3x-WL, nope he did it cause he was bitter at the ceo
[07:00:29] <TimMc> "we’re proud to provide a simple IRC channel anonymizer that allows channel members to participate without fear of being a target, anonymously"

[07:01:44] <calmclam> If he cared about anonymity he'd open up irccloud and tor registrations
