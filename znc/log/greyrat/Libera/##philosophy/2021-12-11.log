[00:00:18] <Atque> causative: No, it's not and there's direct evidence against known to nearly every philosophy undergraduate.
[00:00:36] <causative> what evidence is that?
[00:01:08] <Atque> causative: There was an experience that showed the brain generate the impulse to the arm and so forward before the perception of the idea. There was also a more recent variant of the experience at caltech extending it to decisions and agency.
[00:01:18] <Atque> * experiment
[00:01:40] <causative> yes, I know about that, it doesn't say what you're making it out to say
[00:02:51] <Atque> causative: But it does. The Libet places the experience at a specific time that is inconsistent with your idea.
[00:03:21] <causative> we're talking about this one?  https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/how-a-flawed-experiment-proved-that-free-will-doesnt-exist/
[00:03:21] <ro-bot-o> [url] How a Flawed Experiment "Proved" That Free Will Doesn't Exist - Scientific American Blog Network | blogs.scientificamerican.com
[00:03:37] <Atque> causative: How can you say the subjective experience of a ball etc. moves the arm if the impulse for the movement occurs before the experience?
[00:03:51] <causative> how do you know when the experience occurred?
[00:03:52] <I_Am_M00t> causative: are you arguing that free will exists?
[00:03:59] <causative> no I_Am_M00t
[00:04:03] <biys> ahahah
[00:04:27] <I_Am_M00t> :s this discussion seems very close to a free will and cogito discussion
[00:04:28] <Atque> causative: Free will is not the same as saying consciousness is the homunculus directing the body.
[00:04:36] <causative> Atque, from the article, "However, if we look more closely, Libet’s experiment is full of problematic issues. For example, it relies on the participants’ own recording of when they feel the intention to move. One issue here is that there may be a delay between the impulse to act and their recording of it"
[00:04:47] <causative> so we don't know when the experience occurred
[00:04:50] <causative> only when they recorded it
[00:05:05] <Atque> causative: The article is about free will - not our discussion
[00:05:17] <causative> it discusses some relevant flaws in the experiment
[00:05:30] <causative> we can look at those flaws independently of whether we're talking about consciousness or about free will
[00:05:57] <Atque> causative: It discusses limits using to examine free will.
[00:06:03] <causative> the other thing is, we don't know that the full decision occurred as early as Libet was able to predict it; it may be that he was able to predict how the subject would act, before the decision to act had been fully made
[00:06:21] <biys> i would say the flaw in itself pretty much states the same thing though.  if we're talking about self-reporting of an experience
[00:06:34] <Atque> causative: yes, but the caltech extension did
[00:06:37] <causative> his prediction was not perfectly accurate, perhaps the participant was waiting for a final neurological step to confirm the action, which Libet's recordings and predictions skipped in order to be earlier
[00:07:08] <causative> well, so are you backing away from Libet's experiment and want to talk about the Caltech one now instead?
[00:07:16] <causative> we can do that if you confirm that's what you want
[00:09:14] *** Quits: Rashad (~textual@2a01:9700:15cc:d600:b5d1:5c9e:ec6d:3681) (Quit: My MacBook Air has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[00:09:28] <Atque> causative: The whole discussion is a mess, man.
[00:09:40] <causative> we should draw an argument diagram
[00:09:56] <biys> each frmo th eir own perspective
[00:09:58] <biys> then compare
[00:10:05] <causative> imo that's what philosophy discussions like these need - clear diagrams of what points relate to what points, so no one is confused
[00:10:06] <biys> or you could attempt to steel man eachothers arguments
[00:10:31] <Atque> causative: It started with "white blood cell has a very small amount of consciousness". Now, you've wondered into so many rabbit holes, it's not funny.
[00:10:45] <causative> it's called "examining assumptions," Atque
[00:11:03] <causative> you confidently said I must be wrong - so I'm examining yours
[00:11:36] <Atque> causative: Nah, man, you're committing to positions that you have no support for or notional at best.
[00:11:56] <causative> you don't know enough about my positions to say how much support I have for them
[00:12:09] <biys> this conversation isn't fun anymore
[00:12:16] <Atque> causative: It is not examining assumptions to state as fact that cells and what not have consciousness. It's the opposite. It requires lots of assumptions with silly things in them.
[00:12:33] <causative> part of my position is the commitment that our descriptions of our subjective experiences are causally connected to our subjective experiences
[00:12:50] <causative> that's the point we're talking about with the Libet and Caltech studies and what they may or may not show
[00:13:26] <causative> if you can accept that there is a causal connection there, then you find there must be a close correspondence between what we subjectively experience and what happens in the brain
[00:14:02] <causative> and from there it falls to us to work out what kind of correspondence that must be - specifically, I say it is via the knowledge-action-goal model
[00:15:28] <I_Am_M00t> you're saying that 1. there is an experience and 2. we can describe that in a consistent way? But what point is that meant to prove?
[00:15:46] <biys> white blood cells have consciousness
[00:15:55] <causative> but if you're unwilling to delve into the Libet and Caltech studies of volition, to see if they really say what you thought they said, then I don't have much hope of taking the next step in justifying my position, Atque
[00:16:00] <causative> at least not to you
[00:16:41] <causative> because your interpretation of those studies does contradict one of my premises; I cannot convince you of my conclusion unless I can convince you of how your interpretation of those studies is or at least may be mistaken
[00:17:40] <I_Am_M00t> and are there limits to what aspects of our experience we can describe? Because we can't describe our description of some experience, while also describing the "description" itself. At every moment that we describe something, it's as if we are describing the past. Isn't that a kind of limit?
[00:18:14] <I_Am_M00t> limits to what aspects of our experience we *can't* describe?
[00:18:44] <causative> I_Am_M00t, strictly speaking, being able to describe our experiences is not a necessarily requirement to have them
[00:18:57] <causative> a dog can't describe its experiences, but it does have them
[00:19:10] <causative> *not a necessary requirement to have them
[00:19:46] <causative> being able to describe our experiences is simply, in humans, a particularly convenient and direct way to get at those experiences
[00:19:50] <causative> philosophically speaking
[00:20:16] <causative> https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/fdEWWr8St59bXLbQr/zombies-zombies
[00:20:17] <ro-bot-o> [url] Zombies! Zombies? - LessWrong | www.lesswrong.com
[00:20:45] <ldlework> Try some strong acid and then attempt to describe what you experienced :D
[00:20:55] <I_Am_M00t> ok, but i don't understand what this is meant to prove, no matter what our ability to describe our "experience" means. Maybe I missed something in the discussion
[00:21:21] <Atque> ldlework: It'd be easier to someone who'd also took ice and shared something similar I imagine.
[00:21:25] <causative> I_Am_M00t, it's meant to demonstrate the causal link between our physical actions and our subjective experiences
[00:21:37] <I_Am_M00t> (and again, our act of describing "our experience" is part of our experience, which  i also find problematic)
[00:22:13] <causative> I_Am_M00t, that in one sense, "I did X because my brain had pattern Y" is a true explanation of the action X, and also "I did X because I perceived the conscious correlate of Y" is an equivalent explanation
[00:23:11] <I_Am_M00t> ok.. fine. So basically you're saying that empiricism is ok to use
[00:23:18] <I_Am_M00t> ?
[00:23:53] <causative> yes - Atque seemed to be taking the position that there is no relationship between the physics of the brain and what a person subjectively experiences
[00:24:07] <causative> or perhaps he wasn't taking that position, hard to say when he won't answer direct questions
[00:24:20] <I_Am_M00t> hmm, I don't know what he said, I don't think that's it
[00:24:33] <Atque> causative: No, I am not saying that. I am saying there no basis for saying a subjective experience causes a physical effect.
[00:25:00] <Atque> causative: (i.e. because it supposes cartesian dualism and what not, which are not philosophically credible).
[00:25:32] <causative> well, I do not support cartesian dualism, so your interpretation of the question is making a few unwarranted assumptions
[00:25:46] <Atque> causative: Meanwhile, you're saying things like white blood cells clearly have subjective experience, which we simply don't know.
[00:26:10] <causative> what I said was that "I say" they have subjective experiences - meaning, according to the theory I've developed and am proposing, they do
[00:26:19] <causative> I didn't say how clear or certain this is
[00:26:37] <Atque> causative: It's not reasonable
[00:26:53] <causative> being reasonable is not about whether you agree or not with what I say
[00:27:00] <causative> it's about the methods of interrogation and investigation
[00:27:08] <I_Am_M00t> lol
[00:27:10] <Atque> causative: Well, you need some empirical or analytic support for it.
[00:27:17] <biys> i want to subject causative to a 4 hour RPM test
[00:27:17] <Atque> causative: You don't have any.
[00:27:20] <causative> for example, answering sincere questions, explaining what you think so I can try to compare it to how I think
[00:27:22] <biys> black and white
[00:27:41] <causative> Atque, you refused to engage in the discussion about empirical support or opposition to it
[00:27:55] <causative> i.e. about the brain studies
[00:28:06] <ldlework> causative: you read Graziano's whitepaper yet
[00:28:12] <causative> it's not fair to then claim there's no evidence, or that there's evidence against it, after refusing to talk about same
[00:28:53] <Atque> causative: None of that's relevant though, because it is about the brain and behaviour... not whether a system has subject experience.
[00:29:19] <causative> well Atque I say it is relevant and sketched how and why for you
[00:29:27] *** Quits: jasbrg (~user@pool-173-73-54-73.washdc.fios.verizon.net) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[00:29:37] <Atque> causative: We can't observe whether cats, dogs, rocks, etc. have subjective experience... we just don't know.
[00:29:39] <causative> ldlework, oh yeah, attention schemas, I remember we were talking about that ldlework .  No I haven't read it, but I get the gist
[00:29:50] <ldlework> the whitepaper is fairly short
[00:30:02] <ldlework> but the book is better, though repeats itself a couple times
[00:30:09] <causative> Atque, you repeat that after I already sketched an argument for how we *might* get some evidence about exactly that
[00:30:15] <Atque> causative: Yes, and your arguments leads to silly conclusions, but trivial programs having consciousness (which they probably don't).
[00:30:49] <ldlework> "the space of possible programs" is such an interesting phrase
[00:30:55] <causative> Atque, I could ask you some further probing questions but I'm thinking better of it because you'd just refuse to answer them
[00:31:25] <biys> ask them
[00:31:29] <biys> i adre you
[00:31:52] <causative> well, I would ask him if he thinks it is impossible to gather empirical evidence in favor of or against an entity having consciousness
[00:32:07] <causative> surely he would then admit it is possible, if he's reasonable
[00:32:11] <ldlework> that's the traditional standpoint
[00:32:13] <ldlework> that it is impossible
[00:32:20] <ldlework> that's the zombie experiment afterall
[00:32:23] <I_Am_M00t> lol, causative aren't you completely circumventing the question?
[00:32:36] <causative> ldlework, the zombie experiment doesn't say that
[00:32:54] <ldlework> it does, the whole point is the zombies are physically idential to us, but we take them to be distinct in their lack of internal experience
[00:33:07] <ldlework> it creates a contradiction to materialism because what test can be done?
[00:33:08] <causative> even if we granted P-zombies - which is a bit crazy - that doesn't preclude *all possible* evidence for or against another entity being conscious
[00:33:21] <causative> it just opens a possibility of error
[00:33:35] <ldlework> if you can show the systems are physically the same
[00:33:42] <ldlework> you must conclude that p-zombies do have internal experience
[00:33:43] <ldlework> or we don't
[00:33:55] <causative> there's always a possibility of error - but we can talk to another human being and judge they are conscious.  The p-zombie idea says we could be wrong, but that's not the same as saying that talking to them provides *no* evidence at all towards them being conscious.
[00:33:56] <I_Am_M00t> maybe we are pzombies
[00:34:02] <ldlework> that's graziano's position
[00:34:15] <causative> evidence is a matter of degree and probability
[00:34:22] <Atque> ldlework: You could just frame it as an epistemic limitation, rather than contradicting materialism.
[00:34:40] <I_Am_M00t> causative: i think you're assuming strange things about his position
[00:35:13] <causative> ldlework, surely you agree that if you talk to someone and they seem responsive and intelligent, and they don't seem to be in a coma or a clever animatronic robot, then your subjectively probability that what you are talking to is conscious, should rise?
[00:35:22] <causative> *your subjective
[00:35:40] <ldlework> of course not
[00:35:44] <I_Am_M00t> by that token Google is a highly conscious being
[00:35:44] <ldlework> we're all robots
[00:35:48] <causative> you *don't* agree with that?
[00:35:53] <ldlework> of course not
[00:35:58] <ldlework> we have no epistemic access
[00:36:05] <ldlework> to the truth value of other systems internal experience
[00:36:25] <causative> I didn't say you needed to know for certain
[00:36:35] <causative> I asked whether your subjective, Bayesian probability should rise
[00:36:51] <causative> you don't need direct definitive access to think a proposition is more likely than before
[00:36:53] <I_Am_M00t> causative: you're implying that information systems of today are conscious, pretty much?
[00:37:03] <I_Am_M00t> like IT systems
[00:37:24] <causative> to the extent they can be interpreted as taking actions based on available information to fulfill some goal, yes, I_Am_M00t
[00:37:44] <causative> not *very* conscious - not of moral worth - but some level of perceptual consciousness
[00:37:48] <Atque> causative: Oh, Bayesian probability...? How're you going to calculate Bayesian priors here? You can't make an observation because of no epistemic access, you're not going to do fucking Bayesian stats.

[00:38:22] <causative> Atque, are you discussing things with me or not?
[00:38:59] <Atque> causative: You want stats tutoring?
[00:39:17] <I_Am_M00t> so we're nothing but a soulless computer?
[00:39:19] <causative> I have a math degree with a stats concentration
[00:39:23] <I_Am_M00t> causative: ^
[00:40:29] <causative> I_Am_M00t, I'm a panpsychist, so I'd say that mind and physics are two ways of describing the same thing
[00:40:43] <causative> mind is everything - or physics is everything.  Either way, the description yields the same results.
[00:41:12] <I_Am_M00t> you're just rephrasing the same thing over and over again
[00:41:17] <causative> there aren't any magical souls separate from physics, but if everything is mind you could poetically say everything is soul, if you wanted
[00:41:26] <I_Am_M00t> mind/physics, description/experience
[00:41:28] *** Joins: jasbrg (~user@pool-173-73-54-73.washdc.fios.verizon.net)
[00:41:30] <causative> so then we would be soulful computers
[00:42:10] <causative> mindful computers, at least
[00:42:15] <I_Am_M00t> ok, well, ok
[00:42:18] *** Quits: lakitu (~lakitu@192-198-3-9.dhcp.radiolinkinternet.com) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[00:43:27] <I_Am_M00t> and did you just equate mind with physics, description with experience? doesn't that break the assumption that you can describe your experience?
[00:44:05] <causative> it wasn't an assumption that we can describe our experience - I said some experience can't be described
[00:44:17] <I_Am_M00t> oh, ok
[00:44:18] <causative> it's an empirical observation that we can verbally describe *some* of our experience
[00:44:50] <I_Am_M00t> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ i don't know what to make of that
[00:45:37] <causative> seems simple enough.  I see a red truck, I say "I see a red truck."  I'm describing what I experienced.
[00:45:53] <I_Am_M00t> i don't understand how it relates to the discussion
[00:46:26] <I_Am_M00t> at this point I'm not even sure what the conflict is
[00:46:43] *** Joins: lakitu (~lakitu@192-198-3-9.dhcp.radiolinkinternet.com)
[00:46:55] <Atque> I_Am_M00t: It is not an empirical observation without presupposing the agent in question has subjective experience. You could program a computer to emulate the behaviour superficially, so that assumption is not trivial. So, essential, the argument here just assumes itself to be true. There's nothing achieved by that.
[00:47:57] <zicada> I_Am_M00t: we observe conciousness, but we only guess at what it is yet really. Nobody knows how to square physics/objective reality with whatever conciousness is
[00:48:07] <zicada> its fun to guess, though
[00:48:32] <zicada> as long as we dont have to go to QM every time, because that too, is not understood well
[00:49:09] <causative> if you could program a computer to emulate all of my behavior "superficially," that would be quite a program and I would be inclined to treat it as an equal
[00:49:13] <zicada> the idea that they must therefore be related, is incredibly dumb imo
[00:49:23] <I_Am_M00t> Atque: hmm, I don't follow tbh
[00:49:40] <I_Am_M00t> Atque: where did subjective experience become necessary here?
[00:49:56] <Atque> I_Am_M00t: It's not necessary
[00:50:15] <biys> i can't believe this all started from asking if white blood cells are conscious
[00:50:24] <causative> Atque seems to be saying there is no relationship between my saying "I see a red truck," and my actual subjective seeing of a red truck
[00:50:27] <I_Am_M00t> > <Atque> I_Am_M00t: It is not an empirical observation without presupposing the agent in question has subjective experience.
[00:50:59] <biys> i think it aws also a matter of a computer program being used to spot ant eaters in a picture as being conscious as well
[00:51:06] <I_Am_M00t> ok so what do you mean by having to presuppose subjective experience for it to be an empirical observation?
[00:51:06] <biys> given the goal
[00:51:10] <biys> and accomplishing the goal
[00:51:26] <biys> and observing it happen and interpreting that the goal was the act of classification
[00:51:32] <I_Am_M00t> you don't have to presuppose it... a simple thermometer can accurately observe temperature
[00:51:42] <Atque> causative: Yes, well, you could write a script that says that by downloading a convolutional network in 30 mins. Your script probably wouldn't be conscious hey.
[00:51:56] <biys> it would be though
[00:51:57] <I_Am_M00t> we don't have to concern ourselves with the thermometers subjective experience
[00:52:00] <biys> cause it has a goal it's accomplishing
[00:52:06] <causative> Atque, you don't need a network for that, you just need a print statement
[00:52:07] <biys> and the observer is observing it accomplish that goal
[00:52:14] <causative> Atque, but it misses the point
[00:52:18] <zicada> how do thermometers even factor into this
[00:52:51] <causative> Atque, the question is not whether there is a relationship in the computer program between it saying it sees a red truck, and it seeing the truck - the question is whether that relationship holds within my own mind/brain
[00:53:04] <Atque> I_Am_M00t: Thermometers don't seem like agents tbh
[00:53:10] <causative> and it's at least a very weird and counterintuitive position to say it doesn't hold
[00:53:26] <causative> that the words exiting my mouth about what I saw, don't actually causally relate to what I actually saw
[00:53:32] <zicada> causative: we have no evidence to think theres any difference between your mind and some constructed mind, if they are equally complex
[00:54:07] <zicada> unless we think "our" minds are special somehow
[00:54:10] <causative> sure thing zicada , I started this conversation by responding to that - saying how I think it's not mere complexity that is required, but a relationship between knowledge, action, and goal
[00:54:24] <causative> complexity is needed to form this relationship
[00:54:29] <zicada> either by the good they are created in, or that they have special physical paramters other objects do not have
[00:54:40] <zicada> both of those are silly, so
[00:55:56] <causative> how do we tell whether someone knows something?  we test them - we set up a situation where their goal is to act in a way that's only possible if they actually know the thing
[00:56:17] <zicada> causative: but "emergent" doesnt tell you much. Almost no matter what "solution" you come up with about conciousness at some point its like "pouring pixie dust" into some physical part of the brain
[00:56:31] <zicada> if only conciousness werent so damn subjective
[00:56:35] <zicada> :>
[00:56:38] <causative> to test their knowledge, we set up their goal and observe their action, so that we can solve for the unknown variable of the three, knowledge
[00:57:09] <Atque> causative: Yes, but how do you test if they are lying? You need prior knowledge. You can't do that with subjectivity clearly.
[00:57:34] <causative> you give them sufficient motivation not to lie, Atque - set up their goal
[00:57:54] <biys> the example they used with electrocuting mice and having them avoid the electricity
[00:57:55] <zicada> causative: why go to all this trouble with objective fact, simply ask them
[00:58:07] <Atque> Maybe, they don't know better, are negligent, possessed, whatever... the intention isn't important.
[00:58:10] <biys> s/with/was/
[00:58:10] <ro-bot-o> biys meant to say: the example they used was electrocuting mice and having them avoid the electricity
[00:58:25] <causative> Atque, all you're describing is scenarios in which you failed to set up their goal properly
[00:58:46] <causative> zicada, because they might refuse to tell you
[00:58:54] <causative> or they might have knowledge they can't verbalize
[00:59:07] <causative> if you want to know what a mouse knows, you can't ask it, you have to test it
[00:59:19] <zicada> causative: if you ask whats 2+2 and they go fuck you, simply replace them with somebody who is less of a dick, no
[00:59:21] <Atque> causative: Even psychologically, most behaviour is not goal driven. It's mostly habit. It's hard to see how the metaphor is useful.
[00:59:26] <zicada> doesnt seem to affect the experiment much
[00:59:47] <zicada> we know already what the anwser is, because its objective
[00:59:50] <zicada> was the point
[01:00:00] <causative> Atque, following a habit can be understood as a goal as well
[01:00:18] <causative> the goal being to keep up the habit
[01:00:45] <zicada> but subjective opinion is up to anyone, we have to simply agree or disagree, instead of trust to be correct or incorrect
[01:00:59] <causative> and habits are established because they fulfill other goals
[01:01:01] <Atque> causative: In that case you are saying they do x to do x... that's just saying they are doing x. Not useful
[01:01:28] <causative> no Atque it's different from just doing x because it implies that if you try to stop them from doing x, they will work around your barriers to try to get back to doing x
[01:01:42] <I_Am_M00t> causative: under your model, is a thermometer comparable to an IT system (after all, thermometers make empirically valid observations about temperature)? As such, do you ascribe... consciousness to them?
[01:01:52] <causative> e.g. a habitual smoker, if you take away their cigarettes, will probably find a way to get more despite you
[01:01:54] <Atque> causative: And behaviour persists despite goals. Every year, millions of people try to lose weight, but habit undermines it.
[01:02:19] <causative> a person has many goals, greater and lesser, some serving others, some ascendant at different times
[01:02:45] <causative> when a person eats a whole chocolate cake, they are certainly fulfilling a goal at the moment.  Contrary to a different goal of losing weight, but that's how it goes.
[01:02:59] <Atque> causative: There is lots of research about behavioural and cognitive processes though and this is not how it works.
[01:03:03] <zicada> I_Am_M00t: i still dont understand the thermometer thing
[01:03:05] <zicada> im trying
[01:03:52] <zicada> what about conciousness does the thermometer thing solve ? i dont get it
[01:03:56] <causative> well, it is how it works according to how I understand the mind Atque
[01:04:09] <causative> if you have convincing evidence I am always open to rational back-and-forth persuasion
[01:04:14] <Atque> causative: There is a massive distinction between goal driven behaviour (such as learning organic chemistry) and habits (such as getting tired at 9pm, eating potato chips and wearing blue jeans).
[01:04:15] <zicada> it seems like there are easier explanations
[01:04:43] <zicada> occams razor
[01:05:26] <Atque> causative: Even if you just interview people, they usually won't tell you they put on a shirt with some goal in mind. Maybe, someone wears a shirt to impress a date, but that's different to just putting on a jump habitually in the morning.
[01:05:53] <Atque> causative: So people's accounts of experiences do not always include goals in the orthodox sense.
[01:06:06] <causative> Atque, I'd say it's all an example of seeking goals, and that colloquially people don't understand why they do the things they do, and perhaps some psychologists don't either.

[01:06:31] <causative> here is what a goal means to me - also I might use "objective" or "desire" as synonymous.  A goal is something where if you're pushed off course, you try to go back to it.
[01:07:00] <causative> if someone takes your habitual Tuesday shirt that you wear on Tuesday and throws it in the hall, then come Tuesday morning you will go look for it and try to find it
[01:07:06] <causative> that's goal-oriented behavior
[01:08:26] <I_Am_M00t> Sims have goals
[01:08:27] <causative> to use a differential equation analogy, a goal is an attractor; push the system away from it and it tends to return
[01:08:52] <causative> as long as you don't push it too far
[01:09:32] <Atque> Math isn't psychology or philosophy.
[01:09:54] <I_Am_M00t> > Sims have goals
[01:09:57] <causative> that's a matter of preference
[01:09:59] <causative> sure I_Am_M00t
[01:10:05] <causative> plenty of simple systems do
[01:10:14] <causative> which makes them just a tiny bit conscious, in my book
[01:10:15] <I_Am_M00t> and?
[01:10:31] <I_Am_M00t> right... so this is iffy
[01:10:54] <I_Am_M00t> rocks have the goal of falling toward earth
[01:11:11] <causative> Atque, science is at its best when dealing with rigorous mathematical models.  Psychology is becoming increasingly mathematized over time, for this reason.
[01:11:15] <zicada> one does not simply run log4j atm
[01:11:16] <zicada> jesus
[01:11:29] <I_Am_M00t> lol
[01:11:37] <Atque> causative: No, it's not
[01:11:39] <zicada> even our local paper is posting from the national security agency
[01:11:41] <causative> there are also well-established mathematical areas of philosophy, e.g. logic
[01:11:52] <I_Am_M00t> appeals to authority
[01:11:59] <zicada> if you have anything using log4j update immedliately guys
[01:12:05] <zicada> serious bug came alongo
[01:12:11] <zicada> the horrors
[01:12:27] <causative> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_psychology
[01:12:27] <ro-bot-o> [url] Mathematical psychology - Wikipedia | en.wikipedia.org
[01:12:45] <zicada> its uh game over basicallly
[01:12:47] <Atque> causative: It is becoming more similar to biology... with sporadic explanations against a background of evolutionary theory. Mathematical models in psychology were popular a long time ago, but it's a growing area.
[01:12:51] <I_Am_M00t> causative: honestly, I don't understand how any of what you're saying addresses the problem
[01:13:07] <causative> which problem, I_Am_M00t ?
[01:13:33] <I_Am_M00t> you're just fitting everything into your model
[01:13:43] <causative> good that it all fits then
[01:13:49] <I_Am_M00t> it doesn't
[01:13:55] <I_Am_M00t> it's just assertions
[01:13:59] <causative> then what part do you think doesn't fit?
[01:14:16] <I_Am_M00t> i don't think it's relevant to begin with, a red herring
[01:14:25] <causative> relevant to what?
[01:14:40] <I_Am_M00t> exactly
[01:15:01] <Atque> zicada: What's log4j?
[01:16:10] <I_Am_M00t> my understanding so far is that you're assuming some phenomena related to consciousness "is real", and then based on that assumption creating models. Atque is questioning that assumption
[01:16:20] <I_Am_M00t> causative: ^
[01:16:47] <causative> sure, in a nonspecific way you could say that
[01:16:49] <I_Am_M00t> what that phenomena is i don't quite get, something to do with qualia

[01:17:27] <I_Am_M00t> the point is that you're circumventing a discussion about the assumption, and just providing more examples of how your model fits (if you make that assumption)
[01:17:36] <Atque> I_Am_M00t: I just think questions about subjectivity are uncertain. You can probably rule out some ideas, if there are analytic reasons to or they contradict science, but the specifics seem to be impossible to verify.
[01:17:37] <I_Am_M00t> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

[01:17:58] <I_Am_M00t> causative: that's for you to clarify
[01:18:05] <I_Am_M00t> i don't get it
[01:18:18] <causative> so I'm circumventing a discussion about "the assumption" but you won't tell me what assumption I'm circumventing?
[01:18:36] <causative> why is it bad for me to circumvent it if you don't know what it is?
[01:18:39] <I_Am_M00t> i can't, because you skipped over that step

[01:19:48] <causative> well, to summarize:  I say that consciousness is physically based, and that by tracing back why we act the way we act, we can work out the correlates of consciousness that led us to act that way
[01:20:22] <I_Am_M00t> see, a statement like that.. i find very fuzzy
[01:20:33] <I_Am_M00t> my response is "huh?"
[01:20:46] <causative> for example, if I say "I see at least two species of ducks," then this vocalization must be traceable back to some correlate of my actual experience of seeing the two (or more) species of ducks
[01:21:17] <causative> the sound-pattern of my voice traces back to a neural-pattern, in the past, that corresponds to my subjective experience of seeing the ducks
[01:21:25] <I_Am_M00t> so what? lol
[01:21:48] <Atque> causative: That's silly though. The same sounds could originate from a CD player. Why'd we suppose it means it had a subjective experience.
[01:22:21] <causative> Atque, if you traced back the causal history of the same sounds from the CD player you would not find any correlates of subjective experience - at least not the same kinds.
[01:22:36] <causative> this is a way in which my brain is different from the CD player; the causal chains are different
[01:23:08] <causative> tracing back the same sound from either my brain, or from the CD player, leads you to two radically different causal structures
[01:23:36] <causative> in the former case, the causal structure traced back into my brain has to involve correlates of the actual subjective experience
[01:24:02] <zicada> Atque: log4j is a very commonly used logging-library in java-applications
[01:24:12] <I_Am_M00t> causative: i don't see how one follows the other. How conscious follows from the fact that you can see that one event lead to another.
[01:24:29] <I_Am_M00t> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[01:24:33] <zicada> Atque: a lot of very big companies run it, and they all have to update very quickly, or be open to attacks
[01:24:42] <I_Am_M00t> i just stop there, without even looking at further examples
[01:24:55] <causative> Atque, you see it's not simply about external appearances but about internal causal structures
[01:26:00] <causative> I_Am_M00t, "conscious" is kind of an assumption when we're talking about my own brain - or yours.  We can reasonably assume humans are conscious.  Then we take that assumption to try to analyze what consciousness might really be and how it might work.
[01:26:39] <Atque> causative: Not necessarily. People can dissociate say and say and do things while saying they did not consciously experience them.
[01:26:53] <I_Am_M00t> lol.... this is problematic causative
[01:27:07] <causative> Atque, in that case when we traced the causal chains backwards we would find a different causal structure from the person who is not dissociating
[01:27:14] <Atque> zicada: Cheers, thank you.
[01:27:15] <I_Am_M00t> this is step 1, what do you mean by consciousness?
[01:27:21] <I_Am_M00t> causative: ^
[01:27:23] <causative> and the difference between the causal structure would relate to what each person was conscious or not conscious of
[01:27:29] <I_Am_M00t> this step can't be skipped
[01:28:01] <causative> I_Am_M00t, subjective experience; the "blueness of blue" and such.  I would say it's made up of qualia, which is just another way of talking about subjective experiences and not making any particular extra ontological assertion, in my view.
[01:28:43] <causative> there is something that it is *like* to see a sunset.  What is that?  That's an example of consciousness.
[01:29:27] <I_Am_M00t> ok... so how about this. What if this whole discussion cannot be resolved until this notion of qualia I'd investigated more closely? What if that's where the real problem is? And not in some neuroscientific experiment
[01:29:38] <I_Am_M00t> is investigated*
[01:29:47] <causative> well, Atque objected to the word "qualia" so we stopped using it
[01:29:59] <causative> we went on substituting "subjective experience" for it
[01:30:13] <Atque> Qualia has a specific meaning in philosophy.
[01:30:16] <causative> which I consider the same thing, but Atque does not
[01:30:26] <I_Am_M00t> you didn't stop using the underlying object, you just switched the word. The same fundamental issue is there.
[01:30:41] <causative> a quale is simply a part of one's subjective experience
[01:31:00] <causative> but not according to Atque
[01:31:30] <Atque> causative: You keep highlighting me and completely miscounting what I said. I'm not sure what it says about your consciousness tbh.
[01:32:15] <causative> well, it's not on purpose Atque , the goal of a philosophical discussion like this is to find out what the other person means and help them understand what you mean
[01:32:26] <causative> so help me understand what you mean and how it's different from what I said
[01:32:44] <Atque> causative: I simply said qualia have the same epistemic uncertainty as other notions of subjectivity. Psychological views don't support qualia, because embodied cognition research, but I can't be bothered going into that.
[01:33:14] <causative> wait, you deny the reality of subjective experience as well?
[01:33:50] <Atque> causative: Several people have repeatedly pointed out the gap already multiple times.
[01:34:22] <causative> help me understand what you mean, when you say "the gap" you could be referring to any number of points of dispute
[01:34:33] <causative> and you didn't answer my question yes or no
[01:35:29] <Atque> You're making specific claims about the reality of models of subjective experience without epistemic access to subjective experiences from others.
[01:36:09] <causative> I assume other humans are conscious in approximately the same way that I am
[01:36:22] <causative> and I have direct epistemic access to my own subjective experiences
[01:36:32] <causative> you disagree even with these assumptions?
[01:37:28] <Atque> I'm fairly sure (but not certain) cats, monkeys and people have similar experiences to myself. I don't think rocks and white cells do (but am not certain).
[01:38:02] <causative> fine, so then the fact I don't have epistemic access to the subjective experiences of other *humans* at least, is not a problem
[01:38:13] <causative> because I do have access to my own experiences and I can assume they have similar ones
[01:38:20] <causative> agreed on that?

[01:39:38] <Atque> There
[01:39:43] <causative> you took some kind of oath to never answer a direct question?
[01:40:07] <Atque> There's uncertainty there too though. Studies of memory show people recount their history inaccurately. I have no idea what I did three Saturdays ago.
[01:40:47] <causative> so what, how's that relevant?  I don't remember what I did three Saturdays ago either, so our subjective experiences agree on that score
[01:41:00] <causative> that speaks towards similarity in subjective experiences, i.e. towards my point
[01:41:59] <Atque> Well, subjective experiences seem to be in the present, not the past. So, even in regard to your own, there's not some grand epistemic access.
[01:42:44] <causative> it has to be at least somewhat in the past, because neurons can't interact if you don't give them any time
[01:43:29] <causative> but I digress
[01:43:40] <Atque> No, people can and do generate false memory. And memory is fairly well understood neurologically. It's more of a reconstruct process.
[01:43:49] <causative> yes, and?

[06:40:51] <shea> Your "resentful distrust". What is the purpose of that device over, say, approaching a 'philosophical' statement from a neutral standpoint, neither assuming that is meaningful or that it is not
[06:43:57] <causative> well, it helps you avoid going down a rabbit hole of circular nonsense. And in case it is not nonsense, the attitude helps to lay a good foundation; if we insist from the beginning that our object of study must be concretely grounded, then we are motivated to ground it ourselves if we can
[06:46:02] <causative> what is concretely meaningful is in a way justified - it may not be true, but as a question we are justified in asking it.
[06:48:45] <causative> it's also a question of standards; we should have little patience for those who are unwilling or unable to meaningfully ground their philosophy in a way we can initially understand. There are two possibilities for such a writer: either what they are writing is truly meaningless, or they are a bad writer.
[06:49:15] <harveypwca> Why not both?

[06:51:24] <shea> That sounds like something different from what you described as 'resentful distrust'. It seems to me that you're merely insisting on a more structured apporoach to philosophical inquiry, which is far from presumptively treating something as meaningless. However, by insisting that someone prove their claim 'meaningful' to rebut a presumption that it is not meaningful would be to insist that the
[06:51:26] <shea> person making the claim conduct an almost complete philosophical enquiry on thier own as a threshold for further discussion with others. That seem to me 1) too onerous and necessary; and 2) not conductive to enhancing philosophical conversation.
[06:51:46] <shea> unnecessary*
[06:54:15] <causative> let me put it this way shea , I think that much philosophy is either false or meaningless.  It follows from this that the philosophers engaged in such study were insufficiently resentful and distrusting of the lack of concrete meaning. So we should strive to be more resentful and distrusting than they were.

[06:56:08] <causative> if you want to establish a scientific theory, it is necessary to try as hard as you can and as rigorously as you can to prove it wrong - to be distrustful that it is true and try to catch it in a lie
[06:56:09] <shea> But on your approach, I should just dismiss what you've said out of hand as meaningless
[06:56:38] <causative> and I think a similar approach is warranted in philosophy, with regard to whether the theory is meaningful, let alone true
[06:56:56] <causative> well, I think I have said some concretely meaningful things
[06:56:58] <causative> just now
[06:57:05] <shea> What level of satisfaction should be required before the presumption is rebutted? 'Resentful distrust' has a seemingly high threshold.
[06:57:36] <shea> If that is the case, then your device has an extremely low threshold, such that it is really just nominative
[06:57:43] <shea> or should I say nominal
[06:57:48] <harveypwca> Well, I for one —and I am unanimous on this— resent them for not resenting us more fully and distrust them for not distrusting us enough.
[06:57:54] <causative> well, a higher level of satisfaction than is the general norm among the philosophers who do entertain circular/meaningless ideas
[06:58:07] <causative> strive to resent more than those who don't resent enough
[06:58:43] <shea> Are you suggesting that your idea is more concrete than what is the norm for philosophers?
[06:59:08] <shea> Or rather is more concrete than the ideas that these philosophers usually entertain/
[06:59:26] <causative> yes, I'd say it's more concrete than Hegel for example

[07:00:15] <shea> Now that's a truly absurd thing to say. Based on what you've said so far, it's hard to imagine something that wouldn't satisfy the proof needed to rebutt your presumption
[07:01:52] <causative> to take an extreme example of meaningless "philosophy," try the CTMU
[07:02:49] <causative> that's certainly not very concrete on first or tenth look
[07:03:54] <shea> In what sense does it lack concreteness? Is the entire field of metaphysics meaningless but your metric?
[07:04:28] <causative> I wouldn't say all of metaphysics, but certainly some of it
[07:04:38] <shea> Which part of it?
[07:04:46] <shea> What is the distinction?
[07:04:59] <shea> Must it have some practical significance?
[07:05:06] <causative> CTMU lacks concreteness because if you try to work out what any of it concretely means, you come up blank
[07:05:35] <causative> I wouldn't go so far as to require the significance be practical, but it must be somehow demonstrable - it must make a difference in some way we can recognize as real and present
[07:05:49] <harveypwca> Meaning like beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

[07:06:38] <causative> a concrete claim should be about things that we already accept as basically real and present
[07:06:39] <shea> "Real and present"? What does this mean? This would seem to be a bigger philosophical question in of itself
[07:07:34] <shea> And, in my mind, to answer such questions you would need speak more and more abstractly, and thus violate your requirement of "concreteness". It seems to me rather circular
[07:07:40] <causative> let's leave aside what *is* real and present, and talk first about what we *accept* as real and present at a particular time
[07:07:59] <causative> or what a particular person accepts as real and present at a particular time
[07:08:22] <causative> this concept seems intuitive to me - for example, if you are vacuuming your house, you most likely accept your vacuum cleaner as real and present
[07:08:38] <causative> whether it really is or not is a different story, but I am speaking of your mental state
[07:09:45] <causative> and my assertion is that to do good philosophy, we should demand that new ideas relate in some definite way to what we already regard - in our mental state at the time - as real and present
[07:09:53] <shea> Okay, if we accept that, then for something to be 'concrete' and therefore capable of rebutting the presumption against meaninglessness, the idea must relate to something capable of existing in one's mental state??
[07:10:29] <causative> if by "capable of existing" you mean "capable of being conceived of," then yes
[07:11:04] <causative> I would not say the vacuum cleaner actually exists *in* your mental state - it's conceived of in your mental state, but it physical exists outside your mind or body

[07:13:38] <shea> In that case, I would reject your 'resentful distrust' device on the basis that it hinders to a great extent beneficial philosophical discussion, excluding many school of philosphy. Such an approach would exclude even some of the ideas of even the most practical of thinkers, including Plato.
[07:13:55] <causative> certainly I exclude many of the ideas of Plato
[07:14:20] <shea> Well that is a personal choice, but I wouldn't advocate your approach generally.
[07:14:50] <shea> And I struggle to accept that one can understand Plato without an understanding of his more metaphysical ideas
[07:15:23] <causative> what's a metaphysical idea of Plato that you like?
[07:16:25] <causative> remember I have said that I don't reject all of metaphysics
[07:16:32] <causative> but my question stands
[07:16:38] <shea> Those ideas of the soul contained in Phaedo and The Republic
[07:17:29] <causative> well, pick a particular, single idea that you like, rather than a vague group of them
[07:19:04] <causative> we're trying to determine if the idea can be related to something concretely meaningful
[07:19:08] <shea> There's nothing vague about what I've identified. His ideas on the soul are quite particular
[07:19:14] <causative> so we need a single, specific idea
[07:19:34] <causative> not plural "ideas" - we can't say much concrete about a whole bunch of ideas at once
[07:19:38] <shea> Well, if you insist, his idea of the immortality of the soul might serve as an example
[07:20:51] <causative> well, if you believe as Plato did that the mind is carried along with the soul, then if the soul were immortal we would go on experiencing things after our bodies die
[07:21:06] <causative> so I would say that is indeed a potentially meaningful claim - it relates to definite experiences we might or might not have
[07:21:14] <causative> certainly it's an incorrect claim, but it is meaningful
[07:22:09] <shea> But in what sense is it a concrete claim, by your definition, which is the basis of which you consider a claim meaningful or not
[07:22:25] <causative> well, I consider the experiences I'm having right now to be real and present
[07:22:46] <causative> and if I were to stop having them, upon death, that relates to the experiences I'm having right now, in that it would be a stoppage of them
[07:22:46] <shea> Are you having experiences of the soul which are real and present?
[07:23:53] <causative> I'm having experiences, but I would say they are not of the soul.
[07:24:04] <shea> But of course, you can't know whether your experiences are of the soul in a concrete way, only in the abstract, in any case
[07:24:14] <causative> but *if* Plato were correct, then they would be of the soul, and furthermore they would continue past my death independently of my brain
[07:24:38] <causative> and that's something that relates to my experiences now - even though I do believe my experiences are not of the soul
[07:25:14] <causative> Plato's immortality of the soul at least makes a testable hypothesis
[07:25:25] <shea> It relates to your experiences, but the claim itselef cannot be known concretely. It is not, by your definition, a concrete claim. It is still a claim in the abstract.
[07:25:31] <shea> Testable hypothesis? How?
[07:26:06] <causative> if I die, and observe that I am still experiencing things, this would be a positive test in favor of Plato's immortal soul notion
[07:26:41] <causative> if I die and cease to experience things - well, it's not quite a test, as I won't be able to do anything with that information.  But perhaps I would be able to notice the fading out of my consciousness in my last seconds.
[07:27:08] <causative> in any case there is at least the chance that if Plato is right, some positive evidence of him being right would eventually come to me
[07:27:24] <shea> How would this "test" determine whether the result of continuing to experence things was caused by an immortal soul?
[07:28:27] <causative> it would be consistent with an immortal soul - of course it might be consistent with other things as well.  When we have a choice of multiple explanations for the same phenomenon, we should generally choose the simpler.
[07:29:16] <shea> Isn't all this that we're talking about totally abstract and not concrete at all? There is no way we could know these things
[07:29:19] <causative> I suppose if I kept experiencing things after my death, I would not immediately conclude my soul is immortal; I'd conclude that my mind has somehow outlived my body, so it must be separate from the brain
[07:29:38] <causative> so it must be a separate thing of some kind, and "soul" is a decent word for it
[07:29:52] <causative> but I wouldn't conclude it is immortal because it would have only outlived my body by a short period of time
[07:30:09] <causative> it would have to outlive my body by a *very* long time before I'd start to think that maybe it is truly immortal
[07:30:36] <shea> All this is terribly abstract. Not to say that such a conversation isn't worth having, but I hardly think it supports what you have been saying
[07:30:39] <causative> until then I'd be thinking about the possibility that it could decay sometime soon
[07:31:10] <causative> no, it's not abstract, I'm talking about possible empirical observations in the event of my mind surviving my death

You've tested a hypothetical scenario - and certainly your result is very meaningful and real, i.e. that you should not build that design of bridge.
[07:38:53] <shea> How could it possibly relate to our concrete world? How can Plato's notion of the soul 'make a difference in some way we can recognise as real and present'? How does it relate to 'what we accept as real and present at a particular time or what a particular person accepts as real and present at a particular time'. How does any of this support your assertion that that to do good philosophy, we
[07:38:55] <shea> should demand that new ideas relate in some definite way to what we already regard - in our mental state at the time - as real and present'?

[07:46:18] <causative> that's why CTMU is meaningless - or at least the burden of demonstrating its meaning has not been met
[07:46:26] <shea> Listen, the example of the soul is not a bad example just because you claim that we might be able to test it empirically in some magical land of the never never. That is just total nonsense.
[07:47:03] <shea> So, if we could test something hypoethetically, no matter how much imagination is needed to enable such a test in some other world, that idea is sufficiently concrete to you?
[07:47:09] <causative> the "magical land of never never" you refer to is the land in which Plato is actually right, and you said this was an idea of Plato's that you "liked"
[07:47:14] <causative> do you like it or not?
[07:47:27] <causative> or you like it but still think it's a magical never-never land?
[07:47:44] <shea> I dispute the claim that Plato was speaking concretely. He was clearly speaking in the abstract to make a point as to how one should not fear death.
[07:48:19] <shea> His idea was abstract. To say that Plato believed in the concrete soul would be silly.
[07:48:53] <causative> they weren't that sophisticated in Plato's day, to both believe in something but deny all empirical consequences of it being true
[07:49:35] <causative> if Plato says there was an immortal soul, I'd say Plato thought there was an actual, concrete *thing* in the world, a kind of ghost inhabiting your body and responsible for your mental functions
[07:49:48] <causative> as many people stil think today
[07:50:38] <causative> if your hypothesis is instead, "We have an immortal soul, except that it would be a silly excursion to never-never land to think any consequences of this could be observed," then I would say you have made a meaningless claim
[07:51:00] <causative> such a claim is not testable, it does not relate to experience
[07:51:14] <causative> it makes no concrete difference to the world if it's true or not
[07:51:37] <shea> Whether the soul exists is not empirically testable. That should be beyond dispute.
[07:51:56] <causative> it depends on how you are defining "soul"
[07:52:03] <causative> and on what you attribute to it
[07:52:10] <shea> Plato's idea of the soul is not empirically testable
[07:53:00] <shea> And in my mind, if you conceed that, then you must conceed the broader argument.
[07:53:00] <causative> not even testable in the sense of waking up after your death and going "oh, hey what's up Hades"?
[07:53:34] <causative> if it's not even testable in that sense then I would have to say it's not a meaningful idea
[07:53:35] <shea> What are you not getting? THE IDEA THAT YOU WOULD WAKE UP AFTER DEATH IS AN ABSTRACT IDEA THAT CANNOT BE PROVED
[07:53:53] <causative> it *can* be proved, *by* actually waking up after death
[07:54:02] <shea> The spiritual stands in contradistinction to things temporal
[07:54:06] <causative> after-death me would be able to prove it by observation
[07:54:23] <shea> No I'm sorry, but you have a mistaken idea as to the meaning of proof by empirical testing

[07:55:30] <causative> look around you, make an observation, update what you think about the world.  Is there any reason this could not be done by my future self if I woke up after having died?
[07:56:34] <shea> Okay, so you will conduct this test then to see if the soul is real? It would be a groundbreaking discovery both to philosphy, religion, science. It would be the most significant discovery the world has ever witnessed.
[07:56:58] <causative> certainly I will conduct it, hopefully not sooner than about 60 years from now
[07:57:00] <causative> and you will too
[07:57:49] <shea> How ridiculous. You really have taken me round the twist haven't you?
[07:58:13] <causative> I really don't see what you think is ridiculous about it
[07:59:03] <shea> We will never get past this because our terminology is so disparate as to be irrconcilable.
[08:00:13] <shea> I have never heard of a test that may or may not be able to be conducted, and certainly not on this earth, be described as empirical. That stretches the meaning of the word so thin as to be meaningless.

[08:01:38] <shea> Your idea is silly, and if this conversation has demonstrated anything, it is that the threshold for meaninful ideas under your framework is so incredibly low that I struggle to think of something that would not meet it. I say none of this with ill will.
[08:01:39] <causative> so you don't think that testing for life on the moon Titan is empirical? that test may or may not be able to be conducted, and it is not on this earth
[08:02:13] <shea> As to that last thing, I think you understand the gist of what I was saying
[08:02:21] <shea> I should of said "universe"
[08:02:29] <shea> Or even "dimension"
[08:02:29] <causative> but the test still may or may not be able to be conducted
[08:02:46] <shea> Or perhaps "plane of existence"
[08:03:17] <causative> just different places
[08:03:32] <shea> Your test of the soul could not be conducted on this plane of existence. To describe an imagined test as concrete merely because it would involve an empirical method is absurd and you should stop claiming it.
[08:03:44] <causative> if Plato is right then it would be a lot easier to go to death, than to go to the moon Titan; everyone does the former eventually
[08:03:51] <shea> Perhaps I got lost in the semantics, but that last sentence I think sums it up nicely. GOodby
[08:03:52] <causative> a much more accessible testing location
[08:04:26] <causative> no one has landed on Titan yet and it's possible humans never will, if we destroy ourselves first
[08:04:54] <causative> although we have landed a probe there to take some pictures
[08:06:46] <shea> Your test of the soul could not be conducted on this plane of existence. To describe an imagined test as concrete merely because it would involve an empirical method is absurd and you should stop claiming it, The soul cannot be proven in a concrete way. Plato never claimed this. Your last sentences are an attempt to exploit myself getting confused as to trying to convince you of this last,
[08:06:48] <shea> fundamental point. Even if you're right about the soul, it's still a far far way to proving the worth of your 'resentful distrust' device. This will truly be my last message on the matter.
[08:09:20] <causative> what if souls could come back from the afterlife with retained memories, and communicate those memories to living people.  Then it would be established fact among the living that souls exist.
[08:09:28] <causative> certainly it would be an empirical fact
[08:10:16] <causative> your real objection is not about the "plane of existence" but about the fact that the "explorers" to this "plane" can't come back to inform the rest of us

[15:18:44] <arryana> how come?

[15:19:05] * arryana smiles
[15:19:08] <arryana> she's a wonder
[15:19:32] <pussipupu> Because we're not interested in agility competitions, and because I played with the doggies too much
[15:19:42] <arryana> her 'brother', another rescue greyhound (unrelated) fell in love with a baby blanket i'd made for someone else.  since it was the first and only object he's ever shown affection for, i gave it to him.
[15:19:48] <arryana> now the other greyhound wants one.
[15:19:51] <arryana> feh
[15:20:00] <arryana> that's nonsense, that breeder's a fool
[15:20:15] <arryana> not every dog is cut out for agility, and there is no 'playing with puppies too much'
[15:20:27] <arryana> all interaction is a learning experience for puppies

[15:22:03] <arryana> i only have one reservation about rescue training
[15:22:12] <pussipupu> Hmm?
[15:22:31] <arryana> those with the aptitude love the training.  not all of them are okay with the tension, blood, and pain involved in a real rescue
[15:22:43] <arryana> my older shepherd is -brilliant- at find-carefully
[15:22:49] <arryana> but she's not at all okay with chaos
[15:23:12] <pussipupu> Definitely a worthwhile consideration

[15:23:36] <arryana> yeah
[15:23:42] <arryana> and any good breeder knows that
[15:23:57] <arryana> you can tell if a puppy has aptitude.  you cannot tell if they will be emotionally capable
[15:25:33] <pussipupu> Well, it is what it is, I love her dogs which we've met but we'll just have to find another breeder

[15:35:44] <pussipupu> Because if not I think it could be fun to exercise them with drones

[15:36:00] <arryana> the other one was kept in an old plastic liquid tank and used as an uncertified blood donation dog.  so he was taken out and bled nearly to death every week or so.
[15:36:09] <arryana> they don't need the catch
[15:36:14] <pussipupu> Oh that's so horrible
[15:36:31] <arryana> yeah, he couldn't focus past about eighteen inches beyond his nose, for the first year or two
[15:36:47] <arryana> he still has trouble walking in a straight line sometimes, but overall he's amazingly recovered
[15:37:04] <arryana> and both are sweet beyond reason, and trusting beyond expectation

[15:37:36] <pussipupu> So be fair I also have that problem
[15:37:40] <arryana> but he takes it all in his wobbly stride
[15:37:42] * arryana nods
[15:37:43] <pussipupu> I occasionally just fall over my own feet
[15:38:04] <arryana> that one i'm spared, i'm stupidly coordinated
[15:38:32] <arryana> but i do tend to damage myself without realizing i've done it.
[15:39:09] <arryana> i think that's just a side effect of a ridiculously high pain threshhold
[15:39:44] <arryana> i couldn't love his older greyhound more, she's a doll.
[15:40:05] <pussipupu> I don't have that exactly, but I can't reliably tell when I've hit myself hard enough to draw blood, so my paperwork is sometimes more red than would be ideal
[15:40:06] <arryana> i get all the loves when i visit, and she glues herself to me for the duration.
[15:40:13] <arryana> ahh
[15:40:15] * arryana nods
[15:40:37] <arryana> i noticed the bruises of what is very obviously a broken toe and foot bone a few days ago.  but i have no idea what happened.
[15:40:57] <arryana> i have no doubt that whenver it did, i said something along the lines of 'ow, crap', but then shook it off and forgot about it.
[15:41:50] <arryana> something in my father's line, many of us are like that.
[15:43:42] * arryana puts on 'all aboard the sleigh ride'
[15:49:28] <arryana> i suppose all you have to do is look out the window for that
[15:53:32] <arryana> and for what it's worth, i agree.  a puppy is way safer for your floofs than a rescue
[15:54:11] <pussipupu> Well, I hope to maintain traction so not quite :þ
[15:54:56] <arryana> haha
[15:55:50] <pussipupu> I've already done my annual falling-over-on-ice though, so touch wood I should be safe
