[10:20:32] <Snuupy> Czernobog: no
[10:20:38] <Snuupy> seagate 10tb is cmr
[10:20:40] <Snuupy> iirc
[10:20:43] <Snuupy> but 8 is not
[10:20:44] <Snuupy> go wd
[10:24:12] <Czernobog> @Snuupy, okay, Thank you! How long do these hard disks live? Will it be a good idea to get 2x4TB instead to use the other as a backup?
[10:25:18] <Snuupy> Czernobog: what are you trying to do?
[10:25:33] <Snuupy> is this for long term data storage? look at pricing of disks
[10:25:57] <Snuupy> I went with 4 x 8TB because I don't want bit rot and I want 3 copies of the thing + a spare
[10:26:01] <Czernobog> storage mostly. I will plug it in a computer copy data and use it only when needed
[10:26:19] <Czernobog> That is out of my budget lol
[10:26:23] <Snuupy> 4TBs cost $80usd or so each
[10:26:27] <Snuupy> on sale
[10:26:34] <Snuupy> 8TBs cost what, 130 on sale?
[10:26:45] <Snuupy> so up to you if you can scale up and pay the cheaper per TB cost
[10:26:59] <Snuupy> 120 https://shucks.top/
[10:27:27] <Snuupy> how fast is your internet connection
[10:27:37] <Snuupy> you might be better off with cloud storage tbh
[10:27:54] <Snuupy> monthly sub, break even point for you is probably a few years
[10:28:06] <Czernobog> I can get the 8TB then but I don't know how what is the life and what to do if it fails on me 
[10:28:12] <Snuupy> yeah
[10:28:15] <Snuupy> no copies = no data
[10:28:19] <Snuupy> 1 copy = also no data
[10:28:51] <Czernobog> hmm that's a toughie
[10:29:11] <Snuupy> https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/2224673-the-new-3-2-1-1-backup-rule
[10:29:21] <Snuupy> http://taobackup.com/
[10:29:31] <Snuupy> this is why I said cloud storage might work better
[10:29:42] <Snuupy> their software engineers will handle bit rot/georeplication for you
[10:30:06] <Czernobog> true. 
[10:30:08] <Snuupy> how much storage do you need?
[10:30:23] <Snuupy> can always grab 4 x 4TB or 3 x 4TB
[10:31:28] <Snuupy> https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/gwn6in/advice_on_backup_situation/ "two is one, and one is none"
[10:31:33] <Czernobog> Currently I own a 2TB and 1 TB drive. The 1TB is attached to rPi and works as a seedbox the 2TB, I am trying to use the 2TB one by deleting data I don't need, compressing data, etc 
[10:32:02] <Snuupy> I assume they're both CMR (2TB and 1TB)
[10:33:04] <Czernobog> I can only shell out $250 but the issue is, I am from south asia and storage devices cost a bit more compared to US
[10:33:46] <Czernobog> 1TB HDD is from my old laptop and 2TB is a seagate passport
[10:34:18] <Snuupy> if you have $250 I'd just use cloud if your internet connection is fast enough
[10:34:28] <Snuupy> you can't buy 3 or 4 disks with $250
[10:34:34] <Snuupy> well you can but they'd be tiny
[10:37:10] <Czernobog> Hmm. I guess I am Searching for a cloud which respects privacy and costs reasonable then 
[10:39:49] <Snuupy> again - how much storage do you need?
[10:42:41] <Czernobog> 4TB is a good start
[10:43:15] <Czernobog> I can pay more for more storage later when I need
[10:54:08] <Snuupy> rclone with the crypt backend as a layer on whatever you're uploading to?
[10:55:43] <Czernobog> That will work.

[20:45:04] <rawktucc> good afternoon!
[20:45:08] <rawktucc> two questions for datahoarder
[20:45:15] <DataHoarder> no, no
[20:45:23] <DataHoarder> :)
[20:45:37] <DataHoarder> I'll let other users answer
[20:45:39] <rawktucc> :D
[20:45:54] <rawktucc> 1. just ordered a nice 64TB server. 4x16TB disks. Im thinking ZFS for all 4, and have the / root fs on one drive, taking snapshots daily of changed files so if that drive fails I just reinstall and insert the config files again
[20:46:13] <rawktucc> 2. is it really worth it to archive non-erotic/adult ASMR in 4K, if the whole purpose is the audio (which should just be grabbed in opus)?
[20:46:24] <rawktucc> like i've got some videos that are 3-4GB... it seems excessive when I never actually watch the footage
[20:46:29] <rawktucc> and yet I feel it's the thing "to do"

[20:47:36] <rawktucc> for #1, my concern is just having the rootfs add extra wear to one drive versus spreading it over 4 drives in like a mirror mode, except im not sure how to do that with zfs
[20:47:51] <rawktucc> like in essense having identical partitions I could switch to another drive if things failed

[20:53:15] <evilgohan2> that question is so niche that no one could possibly answer it
[20:53:22] <evilgohan2> "is it worth it to archive [insert topic here]"
[20:53:28] <evilgohan2> that's a question only you can answer for yourself
[20:53:34] <evilgohan2> if it's worth it to you, then archive away.
[20:54:10] <evilgohan2> But ask yourself this: are you asking the question because you're doubting that you should and want someone to talk you out of it, or are you looking for validation? In either case, this ain't the group for it. Only you can answer that for yourself.

[21:02:44] <rawktucc> evilgohan2, I guess asking more in relation to the ethos of datahoarding, and moreso in the cases where someone else would benefit from it
[21:03:36] <rawktucc> often someone has something someone else wants, and in those moments they both appear, then you dont necessarily have exactly what they want
[21:03:46] <rawktucc> I guess it also begs the question in an "art form" style

[21:10:59] <evilgohan2> There is no ethos
[21:11:04] <evilgohan2> some people just keep music
[21:11:09] <evilgohan2> some people archive documents
[21:11:13] <evilgohan2> some keep 40 years of TV on tape
[21:11:31] <evilgohan2> some hold copies of magazines
[21:11:32] <evilgohan2> comics, manga
[21:11:39] <evilgohan2> it's literally whatever you want.
[21:11:48] <evilgohan2> so long as it's not CSEC, of course.
[21:12:39] * imMute knows a guy who hoards literally any music he can get his hands on.  He's got something like 80,000 tracks on the NAS.  He's also super into archiving movies / TV too - does all the ripping and encoding himself.   Other than those 3 he doesn't hoard anything tho.
[21:18:12] <rawktucc_> ive got about 40K tracks myself, of music i actually want to listen to
[21:18:23] <rawktucc_> a lot of that is like, beatles studio outtake crap though

[23:38:31] <ThePendulum> so people are posting ads asking for people with corona who can infect them now, so they can get access to facilities without needing a vaccination

[23:39:09] <ThePendulum> well the administration works like that, the fact they think that's healthier than a vaccination... yeah, where do we start
[23:39:11] <rawktucc> they're effectively banking on not getting insanely sick versus getting vaxed and getting mildly sick
[23:41:38] <ThePendulum> unfortunately because they aren't vaccinated, they are also much more likely to strain hospitals because of their idiocy
[23:42:08] <ThePendulum> imagine being /this/ contrarian, fucking hell
