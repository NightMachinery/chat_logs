[21:24:54] <Graham31415> I've decided to learn some Prolog, but all the introductory material I've found interacts with Prolog systems via a REPL. I'm rather allergic to this style of progamming, and would rather write code into a file in vim, then run some command line incantation to interpret/compile the code. Are there some guidelines for this workflow, or for making
[21:24:54] <Graham31415> command line applications in general? I'm planning to use scryer prolog. After some googling, it seems there's a -g <goal> option that seems to be usable for this purpose. Is the usual approach to provide a wrapper shell script for an application?

[22:37:33] <pikrzysztof> Graham31415: I found Emacs good for that - you write some code in your file and then play with the repl testing/debugging verious goals
[22:38:38] <Graham31415> Thanks pikrzysztof. I see there are good resources for using emacs and prolog. Unfortunately, I don't know emacs and I'd rather spend my (limited) hobby time learning prolog rather than a new editor.
[22:39:34] <pikrzysztof> yeah, not everybody is an emacs fan
[22:40:29] <Graham31415> I want to start off by going through 99 prolog problems, so I guess I'll just use the `-g goal` functionality for now and see if I discover a better system once I learn enough to do a few problems.
[22:42:52] <ski> i dunno Scryer Prolog, but often you can make shebang scripts, perhaps passing `-g go', something like `#!/path/to/scryer_prolog -g go' or `#!/usr/bin/env -S scryer_prolog -g go', and then you define `go :- forall(( generate_solution(X) ),( writeln(X) )).' or whatever you want
[22:49:33] <Graham31415> cool, thanks. I had to import a module for `forall`, and substitute `write(), nl` for writeln, but that works a treat!
