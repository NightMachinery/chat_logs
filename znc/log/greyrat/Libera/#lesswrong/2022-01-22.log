[00:24:24] <kuudes> the vaxzevria thing seems odd; it should be easy to do and oxford has pledged to licence it for free etc

[00:24:59] <pompolic> vaccines that actually work
[00:25:09] <kuudes> which is just vaxzevria
[00:25:16] <kuudes> when it works, I suppose
[00:25:37] <ggreer> their best vaccine is about as good as one shot of J&J: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convidecia
[00:25:43] <Robomot> Convidecia - Wikipedia (AD5-nCOV, trade-named Convidecia, is a single-dose[1] viral vector vaccine for COVID-19 developed by CanSino Biologics. It conducted its Phase III trials in Argentina,[2] Chile,[3] Mexico,[4] Pakistan,[5] Russia,[6] and Saudi Arabia[7] with 40,000 participants.)
[00:25:49] <mst> *wince*
[00:25:55] <ggreer> so if they can't contain omicron, it's gonna be a rough time
[00:26:48] <ggreer> kuudes: IIRC, the sputnik vaccine is two different viral vectors
[00:27:02] <ggreer> which makes it more effective than the astrazeneca vaccine
[00:27:06] <kuudes> it is based on fsb stolen papers of vaxzevria
[00:27:19] <ggreer> good artists copy. great artists steal
[00:27:31] <kuudes> indeed. or have the secret service steal
[00:27:39] <kuudes> still they seem to have hard time on making it work

[00:28:24] <kuudes> that could be useful

[00:31:11] <kuudes> I wonder if it would be useful to snort ratvac

[00:34:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> wtf is vaxzevria
[00:34:53] <ggreer> it makes sense that they'd have trouble manufacturing it even if they did steal the designs. a lot of knowledge isn't written down, or it's in a lot of different places and you can't easily find and copy it all. manufacturing processes are often very complicated

[01:37:38] <kuudes> oh, btw, gwern, I got a random shower thought today: how do we know iq is gaussian distributed and not, say, gompertz?
[01:38:03] <kuudes> I mean, similarly as there are very few or none people who are 3 meters tall, wouldn't it be plausible there are reasonable caps for iq
[01:38:08] <kuudes> which are way less than 6 sd
[01:38:46] <gwern> are you asking about gompertz, or caps?
[01:39:21] <kuudes> well gompertz would compress the tall end
[01:39:37] *** Quits: src (~src@user/src) (Quit: Leaving)
[01:39:56] <gwern> gompertz wouldn't really be consistent with the observation that there are a lot of medium intelligence people
[01:41:06] <kuudes> well it could have such factors that the drop comes way after median
[01:41:58] <gwern> plus you have all the cardinal scales like digit span which look normal
[01:42:34] <gwern> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gompertz_distribution it looks flexible enough you fit it to normal data without much problem, but there's no reason to think it's gompertz
[01:42:39] <Robomot> Gompertz distribution - Wikipedia (In probability and statistics, the Gompertz distribution is a continuous probability distribution, named after Benjamin Gompertz. The Gompertz distribution is often applied to describe the distribution of adult lifespans by demographers[1][2] and actuaries.[3][4] Related fields of science such as biology[5] and gerontology[6] also considered the Gompertz distribution for the …)
[01:43:07] <kuudes> well it would mostly affect the top end
[01:43:08] * gwern was most familiar with it in lifespans and didn't realize it could produce the symmetric hump shape with sufficiently extreme eta
[01:43:26] <kuudes> ie the question is if 4 sd people are indeed as much more intelligent compared to 2 sd people than 2 sd are to 0 sd
[01:43:49] <kuudes> well it is just one special case of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalised_logistic_function#Generalized_logistic_differential_equation isn't it
[01:43:50] <Robomot> Generalised logistic function - Wikipedia (The generalized logistic function or curve, also known as Richards' curve, originally developed for growth modelling, is an extension of the logistic or sigmoid functions, allowing for more flexible S-shaped curves:)
[01:44:21] <gwern> oh. well, you know that we don't know much about very high IQ or how it works other than it definitely looks somewhat different from the lower ranges and it's unclear how much _g_ is there. spearman's hypothesis
[01:44:42] <kuudes> indeed
[01:46:09] <gwern> I've been thinking that this may be explicable in terms of DL scaling: once you're past a certain critical point for a task, after the phase transition, large DL models seem to have semi-random performance on any given benchmark, which has more to do with the dataset & training details than whether it can do it or not. extremely smart people may be 'past the phase transition' (the sort of...
[01:46:15] <gwern> ...phase transition which is especially crystalclear when you look at things like Piagetian development - kids either get concepts like conservation of volume, or they don't)
[01:47:08] <gwern> and that's why _g_ fades away, because for the problems presented in the tests, they are all past the baseline, and now they are held back by specific crystallized knowledge or interests or motivation or perhaps brain-region-specific inefficiencies
[01:48:08] <kuudes> hmm, so does that just mean that we can't make good tasks for them, ie our high hardness tasks are less consistently loaded with g
[01:49:17] <gwern> yes, that's a possibility. we aren't able to come up with good short standardized problems which really stress them adequately
[01:49:58] <gwern> it's like the high IQ society tests - many of them are bullshit trivia questions. hard, undoubtedly, but also only soluble if you happened to read the exact right 1700s english novel
[01:50:07] <kuudes> yes
[01:50:25] <gwern> "let's make the math tests even harder by digging up questions from a physics textbook!" but how do you know you're not doing the same thing there
[01:51:08] <kuudes> I guess the philosophical question is if iq 400 sort of exists yet when we have no instances of that level agents

[01:51:16] <gwern> it may be we just don't have enough really smart people to come up with fair questions. they're all off doing other things

[01:51:48] <gwern> people in psychometrics tend to be bright... but not *too* bright
[01:52:09] <kuudes> it is hard to make tasks that are harder than one's own ability level

[06:54:00] <gwern> eh. there was absolutely no practical movement there for decades... and mainstream cryptographers and payment systems were never going to make it. bitcoin was a black swan
[06:54:47] <kiboneu> rather than a technological limitation, or, i think what a lot of non-hackers struggle with, limitation of the imagination about how far someone can go w.r.t. abusing some systems in an un-expected / un-mapped way

[06:58:31] <gwern> basically, every single person who was working on 'cryptocurrency' stuff in 2007 was either a mathmatician in it to see how far up their own arse they could travel using chaumian blinding in ever more baroque configurations, or they were a fintech who no more wanted a decentralized currency than you want to hug an antimatter human

[07:17:59] <gwern> it turned out to be more useful to filter spam email at the email host level, penalizing email hosts that didn't get their act together, and then email hosts themselves found CAPTCHAs for registrations etc kept their house clean

[07:18:22] <PlanckWalk> Ah right, in email context yes
[07:19:14] <gwern> this was back when machine learning couldn't tell the difference between 'cat' and 'dog' with better than like 70% acuracy, and so CAPTCHAs were really easy to make :)

Between the mid-1990s and mid-2000s, alimony in Switzerland fell from roughly one-half of cases to one-third. In Germany and several American states the length of time it is awarded can be limited; once an ex-husband has shelled out for, say, seven years, his

He wanted to tell a story about someone who turns out to be important despite the fact that no one takes that person seriously. “It took me a long time to realize I was writing about me,” he told me, “and that my feeling of powerlessness and constant anxiety was at

[08:27:18] <Obormot\Arcturus>  relationship. He returned to the message board to applaud her, sort of. “By God, I think she’s right!” he declared.

Whedon told me he had no idea what she was talking about, and Trachtenberg didn’t want to elaborate. One person who worked closely with her on Buffy told me an informal rule
[08:38:26] <Obormot\Arcturus>  did exist, though it was possible Whedon was not aware of it. During the seventh season, when Trachtenberg was 16, Whedon called her into his office for a closed-door meeting.

The tensions with Whedon developed well before her pregnancy. By her own account, she suffered from extreme anxiety and struggled to hit her marks and memorize her lines; Whedon, obsessed with word-perfect dialogue, was not always patient. After she moved over to Angel, she got
[08:45:15] <Obormot\Arcturus>  a tattoo of a rosary on her wrist even though her character was working for a vampire, a creature repelled by crosses. Another time, she chopped off her long hair in the middle of filming an episode. In her Twitter post, Carpenter seemed to blame Whedon for her performance problems. She wrote that his cruelty intensified her anxiety. She got the tattoo, she explained, to help her feel “spiritually grounded” in a volatile
[08:45:15] <Obormot\Arcturus>  work environment." ... uh... is this story supposed to be about how Whedon was hard to work with??
[08:45:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Rebecca X, as she asked to be called, was known as Rebecca Rand Kirshner when she wrote for the last three seasons of Buffy; since then, she has dropped her “patriarchal last name.”" ... rofl

She knew he was joking, but she didn’t find it very funny. “Did it hurt me? Yes. Did I say, ‘Hey, I got a baby in here, what’s your excuse?’ In so many unsaid words, yes. But I think he was actually

[09:46:52] <kiboneu> i just use zfs
[09:47:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> Sucks for workstations though
[09:47:13] <kiboneu> but it has its inflexibilities
[09:47:23] <kiboneu> in what way do you mean?
[09:47:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> RAM requirements
[09:47:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't want my filesystem to use up all my memory
[09:47:50] <kiboneu> oh yeah that's for a specific feature that i don't use
[09:48:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... isn't it for, like, the key thing?
[09:48:30] <adiabatic> it's for the dedupe
[09:48:33] <kiboneu> nah i can still snapshot, have encryption... god what s it called
[09:48:35] <kiboneu> yeah
[09:48:45] <kiboneu> i have compression just not dedupe
[09:48:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok I guess
[09:49:30] <kiboneu> it's also pretty stable. my laptop has shut down from fucking up my low-battery-sleep.sh script
[09:49:33] <kiboneu> manby times
[09:50:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> lol
[09:50:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> By "stable" do you mean "doesn't get corrupted when you shut down unexpectedly"
[09:50:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or something else
[09:50:54] <kiboneu> yeah and i've also ran raid5 on >100tb nas clusters
[09:50:57] <kiboneu> with it
[09:51:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> I mean
[09:51:08] <kiboneu> i don't think btrfs can do raid5 well
[09:51:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> Any journaling FS will have that stability property, right?
[09:51:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> Certainly HFS+ with journaling does
[09:51:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't remember the last time I've had drive corruption on any of my Macs
[09:53:30] <kiboneu> the raid5 equivalent on zfs is actually zraid; i'm talking lower level. btrfs has a write-hole bug STILL
[09:53:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> I was referring to the "laptop shut down" thing
[09:53:53] <kiboneu> and zfs has error correction
[09:53:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> Not the RAID thing
[09:53:55] <kiboneu> ah
[09:53:58] <kiboneu> yeah

[10:12:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Which is to say, the canonical solution is to get a whole chicken, take it apart, use the meat for [whatever], use the bones for broth)
[10:13:09] <kiboneu> yeah i figured that was the way... wondering if there was another way without having to disect a chicken
[10:14:06] <kiboneu> like if capitalism is at the point where we just have packaged chicken bone
[10:14:23] <rsaarelm> I guess you can go digging in food waste bins and hope you get lucky.
[10:14:34] <adiabatic> you can buy chicken-bone broth in tetrapacks and glass jars
[10:14:55] <kiboneu> my needs are niche, i guess

[11:09:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> Google was a much better idea for search ranking? But that's mostly irrelevant because the secret to Google's success isn't a clever algorithm (PageRank), it's their continuous and *massive* investment into combating adversarial optimization

[11:10:14] <PapuaHardyNet> "google was a much better idea for search ranking" are you stating that it wasn't ranking but compute that was their winning sauce?

[11:10:28] <PapuaHardyNet> I'll read it yeah
[11:11:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> Apple computers were really good? Yes they were, and the reason they were really good was execution!
[11:11:58] <PapuaHardyNet> makes sense, yeah.
[11:12:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's like that conversation we had one time here about "why does text look so much better on Macs than on Linux/Windows"
[11:12:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> Is it some secret special rendering algorithm or trick??
[11:13:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> No, it turns out there's no "One Weird Trick", it's just a bunch of little things - a big bunch - optimized over literally decades - the sum of a massive amount of engineering effort put into the problem
[11:13:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> i.e. "no silver bullet, just a whole lot of lead bullets"
[11:14:10] <PapuaHardyNet> all right, so in summary, acc to you, ideas don't matter as much as the execution in *many* domains, and youhave to specify which domain you are talking about when making such a claim
[11:14:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or, as saturn2 put it, fonts look good on Macs because Steve Jobs would yell at Apple engineers if they looked bad
[11:15:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: Here's the thing: without ideas for how to do it, you're gonna fail, yeah. But when are you in that situation? In practice: almost never.
[11:15:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> More likely is the case where you have lots of ideas, too many to use, certainly more than enough, and you have to (a) pick some good ones, (b) execute them really well
[11:17:06] <PapuaHardyNet> right

[17:25:13] <kuudes> you could make it so that the password in itself does not yield the hash on disc, but password + nonce yields

[17:28:53] <two2thehead> alright
[17:29:11] <kuudes> feep, yes, but also to deny the attacker the knowledge the attack worked or not

[19:41:05] <quanticle> Yeah, something like that. In the old days, you had to buy music on physical media, and if you didn't have an old record, tape, or CD, you had to either go without or wait for the radio to play the song.

There are no systematic records of the amount of cash in hand until the jornalia rolls of the s.8 When Henry III wanted to know what cash was available in November , the treasurer had to
[19:52:05] <feepbot> investigate the treasury in person, finding only £ in current coin and some purses of money awaiting assaying.9 It was not until  that there was the first attempt to produce an estimate of annual revenue, to give an overall picture of the government’s financial situation (Mills ). As Mabel Mills wrote: ‘The medieval exchequer officials had grave
[19:52:05] <feepbot> difficulties in estimating current revenue: it is doubtful indeed whether any treasurer before  knew accurately the king’s annual income’ (Mills , p. ).'

[19:56:28] <quanticle> Well, it didn't matter that much back then because most of your wealth was land, and the annual income that came from taxing the output of said land.
[19:57:27] <gwern> it does explain why english governments had such cashflow problems
[19:59:12] <quanticle> Yeah, Graeber talks about this a bit at the beginning of _Debt_
[19:59:26] <quanticle> A lot of ancient societies were starved of cash
[20:00:31] <quanticle> And so they came up with ways of valuing items (usually elaborate tables of valuations and equivalencies) that meant that as long as the trade was being conducted within the community, you didn't need cash.

[20:02:31] <gwern> and sovereign risk. kings are judgmentproof, which is bad for them

Henry persuaded Louis to support his cause and mobilised an army. The Battle of Lewes occurred in 1264, where Henry was defeated and taken prisoner. Henry's eldest son, Edward, escaped from captivity to defeat de Montfort at the Battle of Evesham the following year and freed his
[20:11:02] <quanticle> father. Henry initially enacted a harsh revenge on the remaining rebels, but was persuaded by the Church to mollify his policies through the Dictum of Kenilworth.

And although there have been some people writing from inside the industry here and there, few of those have really lasted. Blogging in general became less popular over the years, replaced in some ways by Twitter threads, and more recently by...
[22:08:44] <gwern> ...Substack, which offers a good way to monetize this stuff. There are good chemistry and pharma accounts on Twitter, some under real names and some not. But writing in longer form, with this regularity. . .that's another thing entirely. It seems clear that I’m an odd case, not least because by this point I’m sort of “grandfathered in” by my long track record. But the intersection of...

Then, Mr. Bushnell said, he realized he

[23:18:46] <gwern> do you push it out to userland where every app can set a customized policy tailored to its needs, or keep it in kernel?

[23:21:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> \o/
[23:21:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> It does explain quite a lot of things, doesn't it
[23:22:04] <pompolic> this sounds like a blog relevant to my interests
[23:22:24] <pompolic> (i just googled said article)
[23:22:27] <gwern> quanticle: that is, they are both equally complex approaches and both satisfy or fail to satisfy edge cases, it's just one is opt-in (pushing policy choices to the end-developer) and the other is opt-out (the GUI setting the default until such time as the end-developer works around it)
[23:22:27] <quanticle> gwern: Yeah, that's a fair point, but the fact that Windows decided to dump the task (trivial though it may be) onto application developers rather than handling the job itself (with perhaps a setting so that applications who don't want the cursor hidden can choose not to have the cursor hidden) seems a bit like the worse-is-better pattern.
[23:23:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> pompolic: Tog is one of the big names in UX design, so if you're into that at all, yes, you'll want to read his stuff
[23:23:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> He wrote the Apple Human Interface Guidelines, e.g.
[23:23:22] <gwern> quanticle: dumping onto the end-user isn't worse-is-better. it's just a design pattern. a microkernel or exokernel is definitely not 'worse is better' - they've spent decades thinking about how to refine abstractions to be as cheap as possible and make 'dumping on the user' even possible
[23:24:01] <gwern> when an exokernel lets userland directly control hard drive reading and allocation, that's a triumph of MIT engineering (incidentally, exokernels came out of MIT, IIRC)
[23:24:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't know about worse is better, but this is definitely a violation of the "sane defaults, robust configuration options" rule
[23:24:31] <quanticle> Yeah, same here. I keep going back to that "Third User" article, most recently in this DSL comment: https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php/topic,5254.msg201769.html#msg201769
[23:24:34] <Robomot> Computing is stuck, software edition [quanticle on January 05, 2022, 08:52:33 pm: [Dinonerd on December 05, 2021, 03:58:52 am: - A good out-of-the-box experience. It should work when I unpack it.] Bruce Tognazzini, ex-Apple employee and founder of their Human Interface Group, has a great essay about this called The Third User. In it, he argues that what Apple is going for is not exactly a good out-of-the-box …]
[23:24:49] <gwern> of course, in an exokernel, the idea is not that you would rewrite hard drive allocation and mapping primitives for every single program, but you'd call to some stdlib
[23:25:11] <gwern> that is, the stdlib is where you'd put policy like 'hide the mouse cursor while typing'
[23:25:34] <gwern> MS's failing here is that there is nowhere in userland for mouse hiding to be enabled as a policy
[23:25:50] <gwern> like, their GUI, whatever they call it, could just hide the mouse!
[23:26:14] <gwern> their basic GUI libraries and toolkits could just do this as part of the basic userland infrastructure
[23:26:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> Their failing is that the checkbox marked "hide mouse when typing" doesn't hide the mouse when typing
[23:27:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> It is definitionally a design error to combine a general-sysprefs config option like that with an API design that leaves the decision to app authors
[23:27:31] <gwern> yes, my point is that this isn't a problem with end-to-end design or making policy settable by user programs. it's just bad decisions about what is worth defaulting and optin vs optout
[23:27:56] <gwern> if there is some setting which most users don't want then sure, make it optin. this is a setting most users want, so it should be optout
[23:28:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> You're misunderstanding
[23:28:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> It would make sense (though be a poor design decision) to have no checkbox at all, and to have apps implement what they want - hiding or no hiding
[23:29:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> It would also make sense (and would be a better design decision) to have a checkbox, and for apps to conform to that checkbox's setting by default (unless the app author explicitly chooses to opt out, via some API calls)
[23:30:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> It makes absolutely no sense to have the checkbox, and THEN for apps to NOT conform to that checkbox's setting by default, unless the app author takes specific actions to conform to it
[23:30:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> That is strictly an error
[23:31:14] <Gurkenglas> see "do not track" HTML header field
[23:32:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Note that Apple's solution is "there is no checkbox, there is just the default behavior, to which all apps conform to by default, unless the app author takes specific actions to opt out" - which is also good)
[23:32:15] <kuudes> I sure would hope we would soon get a court case for explicitly say that DNT must be obeyed on server side
[23:32:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> But Microsoft's actual solution isn't a good or a poor design decision, it is strictly a mistake
[23:32:37] <quanticle> Isn't that a more general version of what gwern is saying? The error isn't that the checkbox dumps the problem of hiding the cursor onto userland, the problem is that the GUI libraries by default don't respect the value, and force the programmer to take extra steps to respect the value.
[23:32:39] <quanticle> If WinForms or WPF respected the value by default (and forced the programmer to opt-out), then how would that be different from what you're stating?
[23:33:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> It would indeed *be* exactly what I am stating, so yes
[23:34:51] <quanticle> I guess the one distinction is that your approach would make even third party GUI libraries (like GTK or QT) respect the value of the checkbox by default, whereas the approach I outlined above would mean that any application with a nonstandard GUI library would have to read the value of the cursor hiding preference and handle it on its own to have conforming behavior.
[23:35:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: First of all, "apps with a nonstandard GUI library" shouldn't even be a thing -_-
[23:37:01] <pompolic> you'll pry imgui out of my cold, dead hands
[23:37:34] <quanticle> So maybe this isn't worse-is-better, but more along the lines of Microsoft imitating the form of Apple's design but not the substance. And that's an old story.
[23:37:36] <quanticle> Anyway, the reason I found this issue is because I was looking into why VSCode doesn't hide the cursor by default when typing, and it turns out that Microsoft's own hot new editor doesn't respect Microsoft's own setting for hiding the mouse cursor.

[23:55:58] <quanticle> So for the record, the IDS Center (the tallest building in Minneapolis) is 241m high. The population for the Minneapolis metro area is about 3.65 million. So I guess the IDS center would be legal under Chinese restrictions.
[23:57:43] <quanticle> Apparently the rule also includes a "hard ban on all buildings over 500m". I guess that means that China just opted out of the race to host the world's tallest building.
