[00:01:06] <tpefreedom> ggoes, what about webkit-based browsers like midori or epiphany/web?
[00:01:37] <scara> Isn't webkit proprietary?
[00:01:47] <scara> Or is that just safari.
[00:02:20] <tpefreedom> I think just safari
[00:02:26] <tpefreedom> midori uses webkit
[00:02:36] <ggoes> tpefreedom: as far as i know both of those are in the trisquel repo, so aside from nonfree JS those are not issues
[00:03:06] <tpefreedom> could you just disable js as well?

[00:27:38] <tpefreedom> yup
[00:27:41] <tpefreedom> afaik
[00:27:53] <ggoes> yep. as with most meetings we'll be covering two separate steps, which are understanding encruption and mobile phone freedom. they might dovetail into each other a little bit, but they are separate steps.
[00:28:11] <zleap> ok
[00:28:19] <bpv> Nice
[00:28:38] *** Joins: lxo (~lxo@gateway/tor-sasl/lxo)
[00:28:42] <ggoes> mobile phone freedom is something of a "digression" step, too. as it's extremely important to address, but it's generally disconnected from the ladder's push to get people using gnu/linux, and our recommendations in this case will end up being slightly different
[00:28:52] <ggoes> notes from last meeting - https://libreplanet.org/wiki/Group:Freedom_Ladder/Free_replacements_meeting
[00:29:05] <ggoes> people can add to the ladder's discussion page 24/7, too :)
[00:30:11] <ggoes> alright, i think we can get rolling
[00:30:45] <ggoes> so, the campaign's team original idea to add encryption as a step was tied to our recently updating the ESD, and our thinking that privacy was important to address somewhere on the ladder
[00:31:39] <ggoes> encryption is a key part of that. just like we want to normalize thinking about software in terms of freedom / the opposite of freedom, we want to normalize encryption in the same way. even if they have "nothing to hide"
[00:31:48] <zleap> so are we talking about disc or e-mail encryption
[00:31:51] <ggoes> i think the "nothing to hide" mentality is going to be the hardest thing to address with this step
[00:31:54] <ggoes> either
[00:31:58] <ggoes> or both
[00:31:58] <mkulko> honestly, i think the ESD is too complicated for the average computer user since it uses the command shell
[00:32:22] <zleap> mkulko, what is ESD (the fact I am asking that may also prove your point)
[00:32:23] <tpefreedom> ESD?
[00:32:34] <ggoes> mkulko: that's interesting. zoe and i have had long back and forths about that. the reason we opted for CLI instructions in the update is that the way thunderbird generates keys now makes them more or less useless outside of thunderbird

[00:33:06] <zleap> i am familar with that, it is just been updated 
[00:33:15] <zleap> to reflet the chances in Thunderbird 
[00:33:15] <lxo> https://www.fsfla.org/blogs/lxo/pub/0G probably belongs in this scenario
[00:33:49] <ggoes> yeah lxo, i was thinking of 0g as well; just being something to make people aware about / help them start thinking about freedom of mobile devices
[00:33:54] <Ranger77|2> The problem is the big tech data collection, because they can link the information and can going too far, for example sell your personal data.
[00:34:05] <zleap> ggoes, good point on that,  i can generate a key in TB but can't useit as it is not stored in .gnupg 
[00:34:11] <Ranger77|2> So encryption is important.

[00:34:48] <zleap> should there be 2 sides to this, 1 encrypton 2 signing
[00:34:53] <bpv> I think that letting people know what it is and how to use it is very important.
[00:35:03] <zleap> the latter could be a step towards the former
[00:35:07] <lxo> as long as you carry non-free software in your pocket or purse, you must assume you're under surveillance, and you probably are
[00:35:21] <tpefreedom> ggoes, I've been thinking about that "nothing to hide" mentality as well, and I've thought of an interesting possibility/question.  Does surveilence assume that at least some of the people being surveiled will have some dirty secret?
[00:35:37] <ggoes> tpefreedom: hmm
[00:35:51] *** Joins: gilq (~Gimg@user/gimg)
[00:36:09] <lxo> but in the spirit of the ladder, we can point at steps to incrementally restore freedom and privacy, and to escape the surveillance blackhole
[00:36:13] <ggoes> i suppose so. it seems that's why bulk surveillance exists. the three letter agencies just gobble up everything and hope for finding a "dirty secret"
[00:36:19] <bpv> Even if nobody has a dirty secret, surveilence will still be used "just in case".

[00:36:38] <zleap> i'll give an example of a problem, needed to send some scanned documents for a job (id docs mostly) so I uploaded to disroot lufti,  which should have been easy for other party to just download, they were unable to, so I ended up sending via e-mail
[00:36:52] <zleap> which defeated the point of trying to send securely, 
[00:37:00] <specing> tpefreedom: is guilty until proven innocent common around the world?
[00:37:02] <tpefreedom> The whole premise behind "innocent until proven guitly", or at least without evidence to justify the surveilence.
[00:37:49] <ggoes> something good about having an "understanding encryption" step is that there's already a way to make it practical -- we can link to the ESD right away
[00:38:00] <zleap> good point
[00:38:17] <ggoes> we don't have a similar guide for encrypting devices, and indeed i think setting up LUKS or anything like it is probably harder than installing gnu/linux itself. i don't know about using gpg to encrypt a lot of files
[00:38:28] <tpefreedom> specing, innocent until proven guilty still is intended to be the basis for the courts/law enforcement in a lot of democratic/representative governments. Whether they actually try to adhrere to that ideal/philsophy is another issue.
[00:39:01] <urza9814> tpefreedom: Another thing to consider...if that's true, why do most corporate environments encrypt both hard drives and emails? That statement tends to be used to imply some kind of nefarious activity, but there's plenty of legitimate reasons to secure something and these days a lot of people that you talk to will *already be using encrypted systems*
[00:39:04] <lxo> can't installers set up fully-encrypted systems these days?  I thought so and, if they don't, that should be high in our wishlist for free distros
[00:39:08] <ggoes> of course, the steps connect insofar as you can and should encrypt your phone. it doesn't get rid of the inherent problems of mobile devices, but it does help protect your privacy
[00:39:19] <mkulko> ggoes: nah luks is 2 commands for a separate drive, or with someting like trisquel its just a checkbox
[00:39:22] <zleap> someone recetnly tried to open my key in word thinking it was some sort of attachment so I sent them a link to esd
[00:39:29] <ggoes> lxo: yes. i just meant if they're trying to encrypt a hard drive *before* they actually begin using gnu/linux, i wouldn't be sure what to suggest
[00:39:36] <bpv> You can encrypt your phone, just turn it off and don't turn it back on ;)
[00:39:43] <ggoes> the trisquel installer encrypts by default, for example
[00:39:46] <ggoes> you have to tell it not to
[00:40:05] <mkulko> ggoes: well thats really good
[00:40:09] <gilq> excuse my ignorance, but what are you referring to as "ESD"?
[00:40:21] <ggoes> gilq: https://emailselfdefense.fsf.org
[00:40:25] <lxo> email self defense, see links above
[00:40:26] <zleap> ggoes, if their install goes wrong, and they lose access to important files as they are encrypyed then it makes it harder for people to provide 1-2-1 on site help, let alone remote
[00:40:28] <ggoes> guide for setting up gpg-encrypted email
[00:40:33] <bpv> gilq, Email self defence
[00:40:37] <ggoes> zleap: that's true
[00:40:44] <gilq> Ok, thanks a lot.
[00:40:50] <urza9814> ggoes: I used to use Truecrypt back when that was a thing but I think LUKS is much easier....takes a couple uses to remember the commands but once you know them it's no harder than mounting a regular drive...although it does probably need some CLI acceptance
[00:40:53] <lxo> a lot indeed ;-D
[00:41:01] <zleap> you need a clear wayt to save the key,  as in click here, save to a safe place
[00:41:02] <lxo> (of responses)
[00:41:32] <mkulko> maybe still link to some simpler encrypted apps also? many people probably wouldnt even be able to find "powershell" or "bash" on their computer
[00:41:44] <ggoes> the idea of "free replacements" extends naturally into mobile phone freedom, i think. there are apps that you urgently should replace if you're using them.
[00:41:57] <tpefreedom> Maybe also signal or something similar?
[00:42:03] <ggoes> yeah
[00:42:04] <gilq> zleap we also need to point out a step to make the backup of the LUKS header. According to the LUKS FAQ, users tend to ruin their header more often than expected
[00:42:08] <tpefreedom> This would also be a good plug for federation.
[00:42:09] <Noisytoot> Hello
[00:42:19] <tpefreedom> Hi Noisytoot 
[00:42:22] <mkulko> tpefreedom: yeah what i was thinking
[00:42:28] <ggoes> signal is not perfect, but it's better for your freedom and privacy than SMS; it's also popular
[00:42:35] <ggoes> so i think that's a good basic suggesiton for the step
[00:42:41] <Noisytoot> Signal is centralized and requires a phone number

[00:43:34] <zleap> asi n small events where we set things up, explain to people exactly what we are doing and have the tools to hand to save backups for people
[00:43:37] <bpv> Just a quick question, is Graphene OS free software?
[00:43:45] <mkulko> bpv: nope, blobs
[00:43:47] <ggoes> bpv: probably large parts of it, but not all of it
[00:44:26] <bpv> I see, my guess is that Linage OS is free.
[00:44:36] <mkulko> still nope
[00:44:36] <ggoes> something we also planned for this step was to give a brief overview of the non-google android ROMs. we won't be recommending them directly or supporting them, but it's important for people to know about.
[00:44:38] <lxo> I'd rather not recommend signal on the grounds that it's a bit of a dead-end in the path to freedom, and it might actually get you stuck there because of networking effects
[00:44:39] <mkulko> replicant
[00:45:10] *** Joins: RedSoxFan07 (~Thunderbi@d-159-250-218-50.ct.cpe.atlanticbb.net)
[00:45:19] <ggoes> similar to how we came up with the idea of "you don't have to buy it now, but you can buy a libreboot-compatible computer later" we can do something similar with phones -- saying that once yours breaks, you should either try to replace it with a replicant compatible one or, if you're in the right position, replace it with nothing :)
[00:45:21] <tpefreedom> 3g is basically dying, and 4g support still isn't here
[00:45:40] <bpv> Dang, is there any free software phone OS?
[00:45:40] <mkulko> honestly w/ all the pegasus intentional backdoor drama i would recommend something like the pinephone that runs gnu/linux
[00:45:45] <ggoes> bpv: just replicant
[00:45:47] <zleap> ggoes, +1  so people are aware that there are alternatives
[00:46:03] <bpv> Replicant?
[00:46:04] <jacobk> Is postmarketOS fully free if nonfree firmware is disabled?
[00:46:13] <ggoes> jacobk: i don't know for sure
[00:46:20] <gilq> lxo I agree. I'd like to add the fact that most of the people do not like to change. So it's better to recommend something that solves the problem once for all (without passing through imperfect solutions)
[00:46:35] <Noisytoot> Does Signal work on postmarketOS?
[00:46:43] <zleap> gilq, but also something you can help them with
[00:46:59] <Ranger77|2> LineageOS does it fully free ?
[00:47:00] <zleap> most phone shops will support android / iphone,  
[00:47:15] <zleap> and probably advise against anything else (as they don't understand it)
[00:47:16] <mkulko> Noisytoot: i mean if you would be able to run an electron app then yeah i guess
[00:47:25] <lxo> long term, promoting gnu on ultraportable computers is probably better than relying on increasingly-hard-to-clean-up code written ultimately for surveillance
[00:47:37] <Noisytoot> mkulko, Electron uses a lot of RAM (and it isn't in the FSD)
[00:47:53] <ggoes> i don't think signal is ideal. but there are many more people on it than there are on XMPP, as far as i understand. so we need to be careful about recommending messaging services that will be of actual use to them than ones they would have to persuade people to join
[00:47:56] <mkulko> lxo: yup, that's what i was saying

[00:48:50] <urza9814> Ranger77|2: Depends on the device, the core I think is open source but for some (probably most I would guess) devices it requires binary firmware...probably among the best you can get if you're trying to find something for the device you already have though
[00:49:04] <Noisytoot> ggoes, but then they would have to later persuade everyone to join MXPP
[00:49:09] <lxo> promoting Tor use is something else (besides reliance on GNU) that I'd recommend borrowing from 0G 
[00:49:13] <bpv> I mean, IRC is nice :)
[00:49:21] <ggoes> Noisytoot: yes, but then they would know why they're doing it and would be more experienced
[00:49:29] <TheBlueWizard> ggoes: Very true, especially due to network effect
[00:49:32] <Ranger77|2> urza9814 Thanks
[00:49:33] <zleap> ggoes, i started with linux in the mid 90's for me irc and other services were a really good source of help
[00:49:43] <mkulko> ggoes: yeah, when i try to get my relatives to switch from whatsapp/discord to *at least* signal the first thing i hear is "i have nothing to hide from the police" or "no, it's inconvenient"
[00:49:55] *** Joins: b0b (~bob@user/b0b)
[00:50:08] <lxo> ggoes, maybe one way to counter the stronger presence in not-quite-free networks is to recommend the actually free ones
[00:50:12] <ggoes> if we just tell them to do it at the start of their journey, i suspect it would just seem like an arbitrary distinction. as both signal and xmpp are free software, the issues with them aren't as clear cut as windows vs gnu/linux
[00:50:13] <bpv> Freedom is worth the inconvience.
[00:50:22] <zoe> problem with messaging services is that it is a step you don't take alone.. 
[00:50:24] <jacobk> The GNU page on other distros mentions that LineageOS uses nonfree libraries.

[00:50:54] <lxo> google, facebook, signal, telegram, I'm told all of them started with interoperable XMPP before becoming walled gardens
[00:51:05] <zoe> zleap: yes exactly
[00:51:06] <ggoes> mkulko: right. people seem especially resistant when it comes to messaging services
[00:51:27] <Noisytoot> lxo, I don't think signal and telegram ever was
[00:51:44] <mkulko> lxo: yeah, to my knowledge google hangouts until 2017/18 used XMPP and was compiant to the standard
[00:51:45] <zleap> another thing to consider that with Covid19 there are contact tracing apps, that allow entry in to venues etc,  as in you scan and it pings you if have possibly come in to contact with an infected person,  some venues are also refusing to serve people who don't use an App or some kind
[00:51:51] <tpefreedom> Maybe tablets/PDAs could replace a lot of the functions of phones.
[00:52:08] <bpv> I don't think that messaging services are the problem, it's social media.
[00:52:23] <zleap> tpefreedom, for a lot of people that is a step backwards,  smartphones are integrated into our lives for a lot of people
[00:52:31] <ggoes> yes, i'm wondering how much we should get into the issue of social media
[00:52:34] <ggoes> that's like a whole other ladder
[00:52:36] <urza9814> bpv: for most people I know those are the same thing....that's gonna be the problem...
[00:52:45] <mkulko> zleap: ooof yeah i needed to get my old android phone with google for that. here in my country they force us to use a proprietary tracking app
[00:52:46] <Noisytoot> digital contact tracing doesn't work
[00:53:03] <zoe> i think federation is an important point for people to learn about when coming into the free software world ggoes 
[00:53:04] <ggoes> it's one of those things that's important to mention but which would become an enormous digression if we start explaining every service / aspect
[00:53:13] <bpv> tpefreedom: I will never use a tablet
[00:53:13] <ggoes> zoe: i 100% agree, just how much
[00:53:18] <zleap> Noisytoot, well that does not stop tjem saying no phone / no service
[00:53:19] <lxo> that reliance of big players on XMPP would seem to be a strong argument for it, and their strongarming of users into walled gardens, an argument against them, and another against recommending walled gardens.  they're too prone to abuse
[00:53:32] <zleap> if that carries on post covid then some of us are really screwed
[00:53:52] <bpv> Does the FSF or GNU have any sort of XMPP server?
[00:54:12] <mkulko> zleap: in china it probably will D:
[00:54:24] <lxo> I'm not as fond of federation as I am of P2P networks myself.  so I'd personally recommend GNU Jami over XMPP
[00:54:33] <ggoes> bpv: we do
[00:54:47] <Noisytoot> zleap, they should provide their own phone then
[00:54:50] <tpefreedom> I think governments like digital tracking (spoiler alert)/contact tracing apps because if they don't really work, then they can still be used for surveilance and whatnot.
[00:54:58] <zoe> ggoes: right, i think enough that people understand the idea behind it and get curious to start using it, the more they find people online (and might be surprised that they find people the already know) the more they will be motivated 
[00:55:03] <ggoes> right
[00:55:05] <gilq> zleap In my country there is a Covid-19 contact tracing app and it's free software (but very few people use it)
[00:55:05] <Noisytoot> bpv, yes, for members
[00:55:11] <zleap> Noisytoot, those of us with no smart phone
[00:55:29] <bpv> ggoes: sounds interesting...
[00:55:31] <zleap> we have one in the UK too
[00:55:37] <ggoes> we can also give at least a cursory mention to services like jmp.chat in this step, which obviously dovetails into xmpp nicely
[00:56:03] <jacobk> Do all P2P apps require that both users are online in order to send messages?
[00:56:25] <ggoes> there's a lot to cover and some especially good resources, there's just nothing comprehensive or perfect when it comes to mobile phone freedom, which is the biggest challenge
[00:56:45] <zleap> McDonalds is an example of where 1 elderly person was refused service due to no phone
[00:56:58] <zleap> like i said if that carries on post covid,  people are going to lose out
[00:56:58] <lxo> zoe, OTOH, federation is superior to centralization, freedom-wise, so it makes sense to present that progression, from walled-garden to centralized to federated to distributed/P2P
[00:57:01] <lxo> IMHO
[00:57:12] <White_Flame> jacobk: many of the darknet systems use anonymous intermediaries that buffer for you in a DHT or something
[00:57:17] <ggoes> lxo: that makes sense
[00:57:17] <zleap> if that app isn't on pinephone then we are equally going to lose out
[00:57:19] <mkulko> maybe also promote apps like Orbot (tor client for mobile apps) also? i find it helpful when i am browsing something on my phone with a public network and i dont want anyone to know
[00:57:20] <gilq> lxo doesn't GNU Jami require to be always online? Wouldn't it be more suitable for real-time messaging/talking?
[00:57:23] <lispmacs[work]> does somebody know if there is some way to get picocom or minicom to go into line mode?
[00:57:29] <ggoes> good idea mkulko
[00:57:53] <ggoes> one big problem is what to suggest to people who have phones running iOS that isnt' as unhelpful as "get rid of your phone"
[00:58:02] <zleap> pinephone or similar freedom respecting phones
[00:58:27] <zleap> ggoes, esp as if that person also has a mac computer the two just work together
[00:58:38] <ggoes> i'm kind of at a loss for that one, as i don't want to make any step have a necessary purchase attached with it. just making people aware that they *can* purchase better options, when they're in a position to
[00:58:42] <zoe> lxo: agreed and those are good steps to keep 
[00:58:49] <Ranger77|2> As far as I know Pinephone has several bug, maybe in the future will it be stable.
[00:58:56] <jacobk> Hopefully Epic v. Apple will result in new ways to get apps without an Apple account
[00:59:29] <White_Flame> Ranger77|2: the pinephone is in beta and very active development, they're refining and fixing bugs
[00:59:37] <mkulko> zleap: yeah that iThing "just works" may also be a deterrent for potential users of free software
[00:59:37] <zleap> jacobk, coudl that reduce app vetting and risk allowing in apps that are malicious (even in a small way)
[00:59:58] <zleap> mkulko, so how can we make things on say Debian just work
[01:00:15] <ggoes> right. we can mention existing projects like pinephone, librem, etc. no full recommendations, but it's important for people new to the community to at least know of their existence
[01:00:23] <jacobk> zleap: yes, but ideally there'd be something like F-droid but for iOS that only serves free software
[01:00:23] <zleap> i fixed the 2nd hdd issue, formatted hdd2 as fat32 and it mounted fine so I could write to it
[01:00:35] <zleap> jacobk,  yeah

[01:00:41] <ggoes> same with alternate mobile OSes, like any running gnu/linux
[01:00:43] <lxo> gilq, I thought the topic was instant messaging, but no, I don't think it requires both parties to be online at the same time.  and if it does, I suppose that could be improved on with the DHT.  I've seen other P2P messaging systems (twister, SSB) that do not require simultaneous presence for communication between parties
[01:00:58] <urza9814> back when I was using KDE a couple years ago they already had pretty decent integration with Android at least...not sure how that has progressed...
[01:01:00] *** Joins: cr0n0s (~quassel@181.67.203.144)
[01:01:24] <tpefreedom> Should we focus more on porting GNU/Linux to mobile or creating a new os for phones rather than trying to fix android or ios?
[01:01:36] <jacobk> The iPhone 7 specifically can boot pmOS and Android, but it's pretty complicated and requires proprietary software running on a host linux machine.
[01:01:38] <mkulko> zleap: create a program that does the same as icloud or the thing on imonsters where it synchronises tabs for you, i guess
[01:01:46] <zleap> tpefreedom, rather than reinventing the wheel lets focus on getting what we have on phones working
[01:01:50] <ggoes> tpefreedom: that's a big question and probably out of the scope of this meeting. but it's interesting to think about
[01:02:23] <ggoes> there are a lot of immediate, practical recommendations to make to someone with an android phone. installing f-droid and perhaps a set of apps that we know don't have issues
[01:02:30] *** Quits: solar_sea_ (~solar_sea@user/solar-sea/x-3088627) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[01:02:35] <ggoes> at the same time we'll mention that f-droid isn't perfect and has issues of its own, and to be wary of that
[01:02:41] <lxo> ggoes, in the same spirit of the ladder, we may be able to recommend some apps for iOS that would ease a transition to freer systems later on.  that's probably the best we can do
[01:02:49] <gilq> lxo I'll check them out: I'm really curious about the functioning of P2P messaging programs.
[01:02:51] <zleap> ggoes, i'll get some more fdroid flyers from the fsfe at some point
[01:03:03] <ggoes> lxo: yeah. we should pull together a list of free ones. it's unfortunate they're more difficult to find
[01:03:04] <scara> I have a iphone 7
[01:03:24] <tpefreedom> F-droid stopped working for me. It would start to work on downloading an app and then stop and give me a message saying "not installed".
[01:03:31] <zoe> yes, i was just thinking the same, we need to provide some simple steps (as well as the advise for the super complex stuff) but we have to motivate them to do do little things too 
[01:03:45] <ggoes> tpefreedom: that also happens to me. i find i have to keep the screen on and in that menu until it completely finishes
[01:03:53] <scara> Whats current topic?
[01:03:59] <zleap> scara, phones
[01:04:03] <ggoes> scara: mobile phone freedom / understanding encryption
[01:04:29] <scara> I feal like I saw the word P2P among these lines... lots of text = hard to read lol
[01:04:34] <urza9814> Doesn't the app store prohibit free software entirely...?
[01:04:40] <urza9814> *the Apple app store
[01:04:43] <ggoes> urza9814: no
[01:04:59] <ggoes> strongly copylefted free software, yes
[01:05:09] <ggoes> afaik
[01:05:22] <scara> I think its because of some library that must be used?
[01:05:38] <ggoes> zoe: yeah, thankfully installing f-droid is pretty easy. the only obstacle is getting people to get past and have a proper understanding of the "scary" screen they have to go through that tells them it's insecure etc etc
[01:05:40] <jacobk> My understanding is that there is no free software in the Apple app store due to EULAs or some other agreements that are required in order to use the store. But there can be open source software (i.e. libre source, but proprietary binary, similar to vscode).
[01:05:42] <mkulko> maybe first say that already using any libre software on your phone is a first step, then deleting the google account may be also better, and finally briefly mentioning that the wider phone modding community usually ports linageos to all phones.
[01:05:48] <zleap> I am on the debian conference list, one of the people there has made an android conference app
[01:05:48] <zleap> https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.metadude.android.debconf.schedule
[01:05:50] <lxo> ggoes, since for iOS there aren't really any free apps, because of app store constraints, maybe we will have to take a step back and settle for apps that would be free on other platforms.  when it comes to communication apps, we might even settle for ones that are merely compatible with protocols that we use in the free world.  which says a lot about the platform's intolerance for user freedom :-(
[01:06:05] <zleap> it may be useful to have something like that for next years libreplanet / emacs conf etc
[01:06:21] <zoe> yeah ggoes Fdroid def + mobile encryption we should also look at 
[01:06:44] <ggoes> lxo: yeah. that is true. i think it's worth telling people about iOS programs that would be free were it not for the app store constraints, as those are likely to be cross-platform, even with gnu
[01:06:49] <scara> Hope apple losses the law suit so we can get 3rd party stores!
[01:06:59] <zleap> i am sure protonVPN works on android / iphone, not sure about pinephone may be we need to find people to test / port it
[01:07:07] <mkulko> ggoes: as GNUtoo said in the previous meeting, we may turn in into an advantage by just saying that that means google cant see what you are doing on fdroid unlike google play
[01:07:24] <ggoes> but in doing that, we should tell them that it's nominally *not* free software if it's in the app store. which is a good opportunity to sneak some anti-apple sentiment in :)
[01:07:38] <ggoes> mkulko: yeah
[01:07:40] <lxo> ggoes, +1
[01:07:51] <zleap> we need some real research in to how much people really care about privacy 
[01:08:15] <zleap> mayme MIT or harvard (I am sure they have a psycology department) could help
[01:08:55] <zoe> there might actually also already be research out there that is relevant
[01:09:16] <zleap> maybe we need to look at that,  understand the mindset of people than plan accordingly
[01:09:19] <mkulko> zleap: i'd say that the more the country has advanced, the more people care about privacy. here in 2nd/3rd world countries the phone hasnt yet become a part of your life
[01:09:26] <scara> "But I'm not doing anything wrong"
[01:09:29] *** Quits: RedSoxFan07 (~Thunderbi@d-159-250-218-50.ct.cpe.atlanticbb.net) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[01:09:32] <zoe> i like that
[01:09:34] <jacobk> It is possible to get apps from outside the app store already, but it's very limited; you have to use an Apple account still, and you have to connect to the an internet-connected Windows or Mac machine every 7 days for the apps to keep working, and you are limited to 2 (iirc) apps per device.
[01:09:42] <ggoes> zleap: i think that most people do. they just don't think of software in terms of privacy, or ethics for that matter, which is part of the ladder's focus to instill good values
[01:09:50] <zleap> mkulko, maybe we need to help those countries more
[01:10:07] <zleap> as in promote free software to them more
[01:10:08] <ggoes> jacobk: that is so cumbersome that i'm not sure it's worth mentioning, except maybe as an option for more adventurous / technical users. but it's good to know
[01:10:08] <zoe> It is also about at which moment they feel strongly enough to stand up for themselves
[01:10:15] <jacobk> yeah, probably not
[01:10:17] <lxo> zleap, if research surprises us in finding that people don't care about privacy, then we probably should work on educating people on why they should care about it
[01:10:41] <zleap> lxo, indeed, but it gives us a solid base to work from then
[01:10:42] <ggoes> +1 lxo
[01:10:58] <lxo> surveillance capitalism pushes people away from caring about it, for obvious reasons, so we may have quite an uphill battle there, but still a very important one, since we can't have freedom without privacy
[01:11:02] <zoe> I think actually Mozilla did research about this not too long ago and found that people care about privacy until they have to take action (or something along these lines) 
[01:11:10] <zleap> thbere are people in africa working to teach people how to use computers, using free software
[01:11:30] <jacobk> ggoes: Although outside-store apps can be used as a way to jailbreak and then allow more freedom, but on modern devices there are so many drawbacks it's probably still not worth mentioning.
[01:11:34] <urza9814> zleap: https://techpolicyinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Prince_Wallsten_How-Much-is-Privacy-Worth-Around-the-World-and-Across-Platforms.pdf page 6 looks interesting to start....and this was published last year
[01:11:50] <zleap> i have been told that young people don't care about privacy, however hanging out here I get the opposite impression
[01:11:54] <mkulko> zleap: unfortunately in africa ptobably they use it not because of the freedom but because its gratis
[01:12:28] <zleap> mkulko, yeah but it is a start,  you are not then being locked in with propriaatory software
[01:12:30] <scara> Limited to 2 apps on free developer accounts and apple can always (and often do) revoke certificates for paid store accounts like appvalley, tutubox cakeapp (dunno if all the names are right)
[01:12:33] <mkulko> zleap: im a young person and i care very deeply about my privacy
[01:12:42] <zleap> mkulko, indeed
[01:13:01] <urza9814> zleap: Probably different ages think about privacy differently...that would be interesting to look into
[01:13:09] <bpv> I'm in college and the privacy choices my university makes boggle my mind.
[01:13:23] <lxo> does being an eternal teen in an aging body count as being young? :-D
[01:13:25] <zleap> what about friends though, can we perhaps change the mind sets of younger people by also advocating the opportunities to get invovled with free software
[01:13:33] *** Joins: Afdal (~Afdal@098-127-081-062.res.spectrum.com)
[01:13:47] <mkulko> bpv: oh no please i hope they dont use proctoring spyware
[01:13:52] <Guest59> I think there would need to be a lot of effort at educational levels, lobbying existing political parties that claim they care about people so privacy can be part of the political agenda and more people become familiar with it and what it means not having privacy and what the alternatives are.
[01:14:23] <zleap> chatting to pepple here who are at college I get the impression that they are generally forced to use closed systems, MS google, facebook (for student meets) zoom etc for lectures
[01:14:49] <zleap> so very little support if you want to use a vpn for example
[01:15:05] <mkulko> Guest59: actually i think that passing laws that hurt apple and MSFT may be also a way
[01:15:12] <Guest59> Also, existing media and public administrations use Whatsapp already in many countries as if it was the default option for messaging apps that everyone has to use.
[01:15:22] <zleap> it takes years to get laws in to place
[01:15:31] <ggoes> yeah
[01:15:35] <bpv> mkulko: I glad that they don't, but they are almost requiring students to use other propritery software (i.e. Fusion 360, MATLAB, etc.)
[01:15:38] <Afdal> It's especially disgusting to me when a class forces people to use Google for materials.  Over the last few years it has become extremely challenging even to make a "burner" Google account to protect your identity without them demanding a phone number from you
[01:15:39] <zleap> if young people have the right to be involved in decisions then we need to emppwer them
[01:15:53] <Guest59> yeah, laws will help, not necessarily targeting specific companies but I know what you mean :)
[01:16:15] <lxo> and lobbyists would probably work hard to render laws that would harm their clients ineffective, or even turn them against the public good
[01:16:30] <zleap> we need more choice in education
[01:16:35] <Afdal> And it's infuriating how quickly institutions adopted Zoom without even a public discussion of alternatives like Jitsi
[01:16:50] <zleap> once institutions who instist on say google lose out because of that things may change
[01:17:07] <zleap> Afdal, public discussion is hard in a pandemic though
[01:17:33] <Noisytoot> Afdal, I refused to use Google Meet for school, so they used Jitsi for me instead
[01:17:42] <bpv> I still have no idea why people choose something like Zoom instead of literally anything else.
[01:17:48] <Afdal> impressive that you were able to say no
[01:17:58] <zleap> bpv, they have not heard of alternatives / replacements
[01:18:14] <zleap> if I arrange to chat with someone i invite them to big blue button
[01:18:15] <Afdal> Honestly I blame it on IT departments functioning like cargo cults
[01:18:30] <zleap> if they are arranging an interview I need to go with what they are using
[01:18:52] <bpv> zleap: Yah, but Zoom came out of nowhere and people started clinging to it for no reason.
[01:19:07] <Afdal> Even after an entire years worth of privacy scandals at Zoom
[01:19:35] <zleap> most people don't understand the tecnnology
[01:19:36] <Guest59> There needs to be a way to send the importance of privacy somehow, maybe by campaigning for diversity in technological choices. There's existing work and ongoing debates on diversity about various personal characteristics (that would be a different topic), but why not including the right to choose our own technology in the debate about diversity?
[01:19:37] <Guest59> then the free software alternative would become more visible naturally
[01:19:38] <mkulko> Noisytoot: tried to say that (we use zoom and whatsapp), got a bad grade and still was forced to use them D:
[01:19:47] <zleap> they are the click here, click there, users
[01:19:49] <lxo> it's almost like some three-letter us agency invented a pandemic to drive people to use zoom ;-D
[01:19:51] <Noisytoot> mkulko, You could refuse
[01:20:17] <scara> Noisytoot: awesome!

[01:22:07] <Afdal> The central problem when it comes to teleconferencing software is who can handle the infrastructure, and giving institutions the courage to host their own instances

[01:22:28] <scara> I had also set my school email to forward to my own email so I didn't have to use outlook but then thay changed it so you can't email people outside of user@school.tld so that effectively broke my forwarder :(

[01:28:05] <zleap> point is, people work hard, earn money, pay for their e-book only to have it removed or altered
[01:28:20] <mkulko> ggoes: yeah, i think we should mention the effects of drm and bad encryption in 1-3 sentences. in fact my grandma tried to record a show on her tv but couldnt because its encrypted. thats a terrible effect that anyone could understand.

[01:28:38] <lightbringer> scara: so are you (this message is double ROT-13 encrypted)
[01:28:53] <Afdal> Think of it this way actually: government censorship when it comes to books has the potential of being opposed through government accountability, transparency laws, elections, etc.  DRM on books allows censorship from private companies--entities that are totally opaque and have no means whatsoever available to the citizen to extract accountability from them.
[01:28:55] <lxo> lightbringer, heh
[01:29:02] <scara> Ah yes the double rot-13!
[01:29:05] <zleap> if people are able to download / print the drm flyer have it read in both pdf and hard copy for just such occasions
[01:29:11] <Afdal> Thus DRM on books poses and even greater threat to information flow than government censorship

[01:32:16] <jacobk> Regarding the harms of DRM, I recently tried to recover an old hard drive that was used with a DVR  (for cable TV) that we no longer have. The drive was ext3 surprisingly, but only a small partition was readable, I think due to DRM. Luckily I was able to see a list of downloaded videos, and none of them were actually important (all on Netflix, which my family is subscribed to and downloads videos from).
[01:32:19] *** Joins: b0b (~bob@user/b0b)
[01:32:32] <mkulko> bpv: oh wooow someone actually switches from free software to proprietary 
[01:32:37] <scara> Breaking copyright is a nesesity quite frankly, I remember a few instences where someone had forgotten their book at home so the teacher would just copy someone elses book so everyone could do their work, another instance, our school does some math quest run game (not sure what to call it) and thay lost some expensive cutouts so thay had to print out some qr codes instead whitch is thechnically
[01:32:39] <scara> illegal (the teacher told me themself)
[01:32:56] <zleap> we have a humax pvr box, it broke, i connected the hdd to this desktop pC via sata cables and just copied the data across
[01:33:24] <Noisytoot> jacobk, Netflix uses DRM
[01:33:27] <zleap> granted there is 1 or 2 non encrypted drives with the programs on and about 5 partitions that are encrypted
[01:33:29] <jacobk> I think the DVR was Dish
[01:33:39] <mkulko> jacobk: well that you can fortunately bypass with a little dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb
[01:33:46] <bpv> mkulko: Also, last year the university cut funding to the free/open source software club :(
[01:33:50] <zleap> so at least I managed to recover the data
[01:34:14] <jacobk> Noisytoot: There's a proprietary program that my family uses that can sort of circumvent (via screen capture) Netflix's DRM.
[01:34:27] <ggoes> what do people think about trying to introduce hard drive encryption before we're actually getting someone on gnu/linux? i think the choices there are between guiding them through some potential options in this step, but it might be better to use it as an incentive to get them on gnu/linux
[01:34:28] <jacobk> mkulko: Wouldn't that erase the drive lol
[01:34:29] <Noisytoot> it still involves running Netflix's DRM
[01:34:36] <ggoes> saying that it will be easier when they're on it, etc. (which it will be)
[01:35:09] <zleap>  I think encryption of any kind can be added later, unless that person is in a position where it is a requirement e.g working in a sensitive data environment
[01:35:20] <scara> Don't netflix sell dvds too?
[01:35:20] <lxo> ggoes, would the data still be readable after the switch, or would that encryption become an impediment to it?
[01:35:23] <zoe> I think it was once sold to me as a while you're installing gnu/linux might as well encrypt your harddrive
[01:35:26] <jacobk> Noisytoot: Yes, if it were up to me I would avoid Netflix entirely, but since the family media player just runs Kodi and replays downloaded Netflix content, it doesn't bother me that much.
[01:35:31] <ggoes> yeah zoe
[01:35:34] <zleap> if they have a laptop / netbook then perhaps yes
[01:35:35] <mkulko> ggoes: bitlocker is a huge 40-bit key size backdoor anyways, veracrypt is kinda slow, so i think getting them to switch to gnu/linux with LUKS is the way

[01:36:11] <ggoes> yeah
[01:36:34] <zleap> I agree there too,  we just need to be careful we don't lock people out of their data

[01:39:41] <zleap> i was thinking about what scara said about cpu usage
[01:39:46] <Afdal> The truth is that computers are designed from the ground up around the trivial replication of information and copyright is fundamentally incompatible with them
[01:39:47] <scara> If copyright is gone then GPL is ruined

[01:45:16] <Noisytoot> scara, No, because they would have to either take your computer apart and use an SPI thing to reflash your boot firmware, or boot your system (which would be impossible if you encrypt it)

[01:45:27] <scara> Technoturnovers: depends on modle

[01:45:40] <Technoturnovers> mkulko: you can add your own keys, that is a microsoft requirement, they REQUIRE that you be allowed to add your own keys

[02:07:34] <zleap> i think with social media there are some great decentralised projects, flockingbird is a more privacy centric linkedin replacement
[02:07:57] <tpefreedom> what is the telescope running?
[02:07:59] <zleap> these projects just need help, then users
[02:08:04] <zleap> not sure off hand
[02:08:19] <tpefreedom> is it going to use free software?
[02:08:32] <zleap> it won't be windows, you can't just pop in to space to hit ctrl-alt-delete 
[02:09:02] <tpefreedom> lol
[02:09:17] <tpefreedom> I don't think that works the same way on the NT kernel anyway.
[02:09:29] <Noisytoot> <zleap> you are probably closer to Cambridge UK
[02:09:33] <Noisytoot> I am in Cambridge UK
[02:09:40] <zoe> Ok i have been drifting away a couple times, but going forreal now, will read up a little later as well, but thanks everyone for all the input!
[02:10:15] <zleap> no problem
[02:11:46] <zleap> ok not sure what software the telescope runs
[02:12:59] <zleap> doesnt the mars rover run Linux or bsd
[02:13:14] <Noisytoot> probably
[02:13:43] <la_mettrie> solaris?

[02:17:41] <Noisytoot> la_mettrie, not red star linux
[02:17:43] <zleap> chat later all and thanks for another greatmeeting
[02:17:50] <ggoes> thank you zleap
[02:17:56] <zleap> no probs
[02:18:25] <tpefreedom> I've been thinking that it might be useful to have more than one fully-free os, rather than just different distros of the same one. In particular, fully free OSes not based on unix-like systems/tools.
[02:18:46] <zleap> i will also try and find out about the telescope as I am writing an article for the Open university space science society about it
[02:19:24] <zleap> tpefreedom, that sounds a huge undertaking given we struggle to get people to develop what we have
[02:20:04] <Afdal> GNU/Hurd when?
[02:20:04] <tpefreedom> It's an idea I've been thinking about mostly.
[02:20:35] <adfeno> Secure Boot is good to have, Restricted Boot is bad.
[02:21:04] <tpefreedom> There is FreeMiNT as at least a base.
[02:21:11] <jacobk> Is there a list somewhere of operating systems that are free in most cases but not FSDG-compliant (e.g. because they offer the option to install nonfree firmware)?
[02:21:17] <tpefreedom> Assuming someone recompiles it for x86/arm.
[02:21:39] <adfeno> Technoturnovers, zleap : Re: windows for work: then we start to have to first address WHO is the user.
[02:21:49] <zleap> yeah
[02:22:05] <zleap> wellusually work computers are owned by the company and you can't make modificatons
[02:22:21] <tpefreedom> Haiku, reactos, risc os open, etc would all be great OSes from what I've seen if they removed all the nonfree stuff (and in the case of reactos focused less on compatibility with proprietary windows software.)
[02:22:26] <zleap> anyway,  i will be back on tomorrow, we can chat then

[02:22:43] <zleap> yeah

[02:23:14] <zleap> anyway chat later,  but i like the idea, arm / risc could be the way forward though

[20:53:04] <davisr> Hi, I've not participated in the Free Software Directory but I would like to. I sell a paid AGPLv3 product that does local/non-cloud document transfer and management of reMarkable e-paper tablets. It has nearly 2,000 users.
[20:53:10] <davisr> Previously I had an issue with a Savannah administrator not feeling I was within their hosting requirements, which are similar to FSD's guidelines. My software forms a network (SSH) connection to these stock tablets (using manufacturer's proprietary firmware). I ported Parabola to these tablets to prove they can indeed run free software, but that was not enough to convince Savannah administration.
[20:53:17] <davisr> Other administrators chimed in, and gave me conflicting answers as to the validity of my request. There was no resolve. Is the Free Software Directory appropriate to list my software? I feel that my software complies with the spirit and letter of the guidelines, and makes users free by not relying on these tablet's proprietary online services, effectively turning them into appliances. -- Thanks
[20:54:08] <donald> davisr: that's great to hear
[20:54:10] *** Quits: mirage (~mirage@user/mirage) (Quit: Date's Incoherence Principle - it's not possible to treat coherently that which is incoherent)
[20:54:23] <donald> davisr: it's possible that the software could fit on the directory
[20:54:26] *** Joins: Emulatorman (~andre@81.17.31.48)
[20:55:04] <donald> davisr: but keep in mind that entries in the directory are for individual packages, so if you have a whole system going, the directory isn't really the place for it
[20:55:15] <donald> davisr: but you can add the individual packages instead
[20:55:50] *** Joins: mirage (mirage@user/mirage)
[20:56:13] <donald> davisr: so you say the software works on both parabola and the regular proprietary firmware?
[20:56:16] <davisr> Hi donald, thanks -- I am asking specifically about a GUI program I developed called reMarkable Connection Utility (RCU), not the Parabola OS. Here is the project page: http://www.davisr.me/projects/rcu/
[20:56:23] <tpefreedom> What is the url for the services page?
[20:56:30] <tpefreedom> I'm having trouble finding it.
[20:56:42] <donald> davisr: for the directory, software that works on both free and non free systems is fine, so like as they are the same
[20:57:03] <donald> davisr: as we don't want the version on free systems to be a broken mess
[20:57:26] <donald> tpefreedom: it's a category

[20:58:18] <davisr> So it is meant to work with the manufacturer's firmware, but the confusion in the past has stemmed around what "works with free and non-free OS equally well", because while this GUI app is free and runs on a free OS equally, it is meant to be used with the manufactuer's stock firmware which writes files into proprietary data formats. My software unencumbers these files and only alters files on the tablet's filesystem.

[20:59:16] <donald> davisr: ah, so while it runs on parabola, there's nothing for it to do there?
[21:00:38] <tpefreedom> donald, ok. ty
[21:00:40] <davisr> donald, So this GUI app only transfers files to/from the tablet over SSH, and there isn't a clear definition of what "interoperate" means regarding that kind of activity, since the app itself is AGPL and runs fine on e.g. Trisquel.
[21:01:22] *** Quits: quarkyalice (~quarkyali@user/quarkyalice) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[21:02:21] <davisr> donald, The controversy stems around what it means to encourage use of the manufacturer's non-free software. On one hand, my software is meant to interoperate with it. On the other, it makes users freer because they'd otherwise have to rely on this manufacturer's proprietary cloud services.

[23:09:24] <davisr> Forgive me if this has been discussed before, I haven't searched through the mailing list: has there been an effort to build a database from the directory wiki, in order to establish regular contacts/checks on the free software listed, such as to keep the list current and accurate?

[23:15:34] <donald> davisr: we had a contractor write the original script and did an import long ago, but no one has been able to get it going again
