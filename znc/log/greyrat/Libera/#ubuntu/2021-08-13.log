[00:29:07] <Croran> vi gives a bunch of errors of course, since it has no permission to read the file, but what's crazy is after the attempt to modify and save, the file has 220 permissions.
[00:29:19] <Croran> and owned by me
[00:29:32] <Croran> but 0 bytes, even though i had text typed into vi
[00:30:56] <Croran> can someone explain what happens?
[00:31:19] <matsaman> 222 becomes 220 or 200?

[05:37:45] <rbasak> There is "apt policy <package>" which will show you where apt _currently_ sees a package as available from. However that doesn't necessarily mean that a package was installed from a source it displays there. Different sources may even present the same package and version but with different contents, and apt/dpkg wouldn't know it.

[07:59:02] <SnoopJ> coryc257, I'm not sure to what extent fprime runs on Ingy in userspace without a closer look. I got the impression that maybe it embedded well and the kernel really is there for a sane multipurpose base
[07:59:11] <chibill[m]> Yea, found it under a totally different name in aplay, pulse audio is still busted by my software didnt use it so i am good.
[08:00:12] <SnoopJ> but I guess it's still "userspace" indeed :)
[08:00:19] <coryc257> good! I've never had any issues with pulseaudio but I've heard it can be finnicky
[08:01:16] <coryc257> SnoopJ, I wonder if amazon plans on using that in their delivery drones if that ever "takes off"

[08:01:51] <SnoopJ> coryc257, they certainly have the assets necessary to build their own flight software, or acquire someone else's, but fprime looks like it would be a solid base.
[08:02:09] <SnoopJ> And it fits their diversification portfolio well in other places
[08:02:52] <SnoopJ> anyway, I think of Ingy and I think of Linux on something like gumstix-or-less, but I don't actually know what's in Ingy. I know I've bounced off the question a few times, never found the right literature.

[10:07:04] <SnoopJ> coryc257, so, I got substantially better fishing luck this dive. The avionics are detailed fairly well here: https://trs.jpl.nasa.gov/bitstream/handle/2014/46229/CL%2317-6243.pdf?sequence=1 p.p. 11 points out that the Snapdragon 801 running Linux is for "high-level functions" and flight control is handled by dedicated MCUs which talk to the snapdragon over UART
[10:07:34] <SnoopJ> in other words, the Linux part ain't doing the realtime-demanding parts of the driving I think, or at least not the worst of it

[12:42:08] <geirha> anyway, whatever path it was given it would've gone through it and changed ownership of all files to user root, group root.  /usr/bin/sudo was most likely in its path there. Changing ownership of a file has the side effect of removing any setuid bit, which sudo relies on
[12:42:57] <geirha> chmod u+s /usr/bin/sudo  might fix sudo up, but it's likely not the only thing affected

[16:06:31] <zetheroo> I am trying to figure out what has caused my laptop with 20.04 to semi-crash twice in the last couple hours. Essentially the semi-crash looks like this: I will be working with apps like Chrome, Slack, and Signal open, and at some point (usually after a couple hours) I will be moving the mouse cursor and suddenly everywhere it moves over those three apps it will "draw" a bunch of white blank space. Over apps like the Terminal and Resource
[16:06:31] <zetheroo>  Monitor the white blank spaces don't occur. Then Chrome completely crashes and the other apps like Signal and Slack become unresponsive. Terminal and Resource Monitor continue to work fine. If I try to open Chrome via the terminal I see this:

[16:35:34] <Liblx> when i use sed with the argument 'input.txt > output.txt' it does not work to use the input also for the output. but i just want to change the file without writing to a new file. do i have to rename and delete afterwards. or is there a trick?
[16:35:42] <Liblx> thanks

[16:49:52] <geirha> GNU sed has a -i to do "in-place editing". It basically just does the same under the hood; writes to a new file, then moves it over the original. You end up with a new file either way.

[21:24:12] <brotherBox> Hi. I'm using Ubuntu with systemd-boot. To decrypt a cryptdevice on startup I pass the cryptdevice=/dev/nvme0n1p4 parameter. (I'm not sure if I can pass a UUID here) However, the initrd seems to ignore that parameter. There is a crypttab file containing the UUID of my crypt partition, but that seems to get ignored. What can I do to fix this?

[22:49:16] <leftyfb> you mentioned 15 partitions
[22:49:16] <ipatrol> Also, stupid autocomplete, I meant OS
[22:52:31] <ipatrol> sda1 contains my NTFS files from an older system, sda2 contains the EFI partition, sda3 contains /boot for Ubuntu, sda4 contains Ubuntu's LVM, sda5 contains the (shared between the OSes) /home directory, sda6 contains CentOS's /boot, sda7 contains CentOS's LVM, sda8 contains another LVM extent.
[22:54:08] <ipatrol> sda4's LVM partitions contain one for the main OS files, one for /var/backups (for isolation), /var (uses a different FS optimized for it), swap, /opt, and the non-shared /home.
[22:55:22] <ipatrol> The /home partition uses BTRFS, the /var partition uses XFS, and the others use ext4
