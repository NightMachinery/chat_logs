[00:02:50] <White_Flame> it's somewhat reminiscent of the HP saturn processor from the graphing calculators, which had field access instructions for the various floating point fields of a register
[00:03:25] <White_Flame> hmm, though that has nothing to do with instruction encoding :shrug:
[00:05:32] <White_Flame> it does seem to be a reasonable idea to have the address space width smaller than the register width, to have extra stuff available
[00:06:03] <White_Flame> would make immediate addresses in opcodes a lot more viable, too
[00:06:35] <gilberth> Heh, like my itty design. :)
[00:07:01] <White_Flame> yeah, didn't recall if you took advantage of that or not
[00:07:10] <White_Flame> it's a nuisance in so many ISAs
[00:07:43] <gilberth> It's rather a disadvantage. And yes, very old ISAs were my inspiration.
[00:09:52] <gilberth> And as indirect addressing need to be done by self-modifying code, I consider a DAP instruction. Deposit Address Part. Which would store just the 24 or 28 address bits into an existing instruction.

[02:59:59] <Catie> I use Gateron red at work
[03:00:30] <Catie> They take considerably less force to press than the Cherry MX reds that I have at home, which is what I want in a switch
[03:00:32] <gilberth> That is the clicky type, isn't it?
[03:00:39] <Catie> It's the non-clicky
[03:01:33] <gilberth> Linear? Or is there still a "click point" you can feel?
[03:01:40] <Catie> Linear
[03:03:06] <gilberth> Ok. So I need another type than red. I consider to get one of those Keychron keyboards. I like the layout and my current keyboard is rubbish. They use Gateron switches, which is why I asked.
[03:03:27] <Catie> I'm using the Keychron C2 at work, so that's perfect! I like it well enough

[03:06:16] <gilberth> Though I can't find one with US layout. But I am used to use the US layout with German labels on the keycaps. And you get an extra key between <shift> and "z".

[04:22:23] <mfiano> and, this is libc.so btw
[04:23:28] <pl> mfiano: can you share the line?
[04:23:40] <mfiano> 2 with a comment
[04:23:49] <mfiano> GROUP ( /lib/libc.so.7 /usr/lib/libc_nonshared.a )
[04:23:57] <mfiano> First is /* $FreeBSD$ */
[04:24:02] <mfiano> That didn't paste both, sorry
[04:24:43] <pl> mfiano: you need to change your libc.so to libc.so.7 because apparently dlopen() (or whatever the equivalent) doesn't handle shitty redirects
[04:25:49] <pl> tl;dr unversioned files don't necessarily work, and while on linux they are often symbolic links to versioned ones, that's not guaranteed and most annoyingly they can be linker scripts
[04:26:13] <mfiano> This is odd, because this is code Catie wrote, and we're on the same version of FreeBSD.
[04:26:22] <mfiano> I don't get it, why it fails for me.
[04:26:47] <pl> mfiano: just for your own sanity's sake, try to simply switch to libc.so.7
[04:26:56] <mfiano> THat does indeed work
[04:29:48] <pl> generally in the future I recommend that if shared object exists in versioned name, always use the versioned name
[04:29:55] <pl> I hit similar issue on linux, I recall
[04:30:24] <moon-child> fuck versioned shared libs
[04:30:28] <moon-child> all my homies hate versioned shared libs
[04:30:31] <mfiano> I am not doubting that to be good practice, just curious why Catie's link works.
[04:31:11] <pl> tl;dr it involves making it so that when you pass -lc to linker, it knows to actually link to libc.so.7 *or* the static library depending on what symbol is being searched for
[04:31:15] <hayley> Fuck linking

[06:49:31] <gilberth> What is a client and what is a style?
[06:50:23] <hayley> A client is a configuration object used in Strandh-ware. e.g. Cleavir might have a SICL client, where some transformation is customized by SICL.
[06:50:38] <hayley> A style is how the text is printed, I guess.
[06:54:52] <gilberth> Hmm, why not use CLIM? I still don't get what a client is, what does it have to do with printing? And that package trivial-stream-column is a misnomer. Usually trivial-foo are just the most thin layer around a commonly implemented, but living in different packages, CL feature. *sigh*
[06:55:38] <hayley> To demo that the SICL printer can handle it anyway.
[06:56:27] <hayley> I guess that there would be a CLIM client, which handles colour using CLIM, a terminal client, which emits the control codes, and a plain text client, which ignores colour.
[06:59:08] <gilberth> This is what I meant. Why not just use CLIM? We don't need new APIs for terminals or plain text.

[07:42:49] <hayley> Just me complaining? Guess it is one of my "favourite" topics.
[07:42:55] <moon-child> hayley: depends on how you use it
[07:43:12] <moon-child> cooperative multitasking is a great way to make emulators
[07:43:34] <hayley> Emulators work cause you can guarantee you yield after e.g. 100 cycles.
[07:44:21] <moon-child> right
[07:44:28] <moon-child> point is it's not a panacea but it _is_ a useful language feature
[07:44:35] <hayley> If you have any ol' code, then you can't be sure if you're yielding fast enough or not. And if yielding is your only synchronisation primitive, then you have no choice but to not yield sometimes.
[07:45:08] <hayley> IIRC "time to safepoint" is a big deal in low latency GCs, because more safepoints means faster time to safepoint (as you hit them more often), but less throughput, and vice versa.

[07:47:39] <moon-child> there are certain tasks for which people use threads, for which coroutines would be appropriate; and some for which coroutines would be inappropriate; fair?
[07:47:55] <moon-child> userspace/m:n is logically threading, just with cheaper ctx switches

[08:34:21] <gilberth> It's harder even, when you live somewhere, where nobody talks. It's like that in the kind of rural area where my house is. Or perhaps, I just don't fit in. I don't know what their problem is. But I am not the only one, who moved there and can't find friends.

[09:06:26] <gilberth> Still there is some way to go. You don't meet those people twice, you need to be quick to exchange phone numbers. Something I am very bad at and not bold enough to.
[09:12:30] <pjb> gilberth: missed out or flunked?
[09:14:30] <gilberth> pjb: Perhaps the latter initially. Definitely was the case at school.
[09:17:14] <gilberth> If you mean to be excluded by flunked.

[09:30:43] <hayley> Now I recall that one of the big articles in favour of concurrency is "The free lunch is over" <http://www.gotw.ca/publications/concurrency-ddj.htm>

[09:35:11] <gilberth> pjb: Well, I for one, would like to have a life for a change.
[09:36:19] <hayley> Hey, lock free programming gets all the girls.
[09:36:28] <gilberth> And solitude could kill you, it's instinct of humans to seek company for survival. You get a lot of stress from seeing no other people.
[09:39:51] <moon-child> supposedly: there was an experiment done by some king a few hundred years ago.  He took babies, gave them water and food, but did not allow them contact with humans.  All died
[09:41:43] <White_Flame> I heard that was russian orphanages
[09:43:25] <gilberth> Yep. My "rest" heart rate is down form beyond 100 beats per minute to like 80 by now as I live almost a year with my cousin.
[09:45:36] <White_Flame> it's a good idea to practice increasing/decreasing your heart rate, just by controlled breathing
[09:46:29] <gilberth> I could imagine decreasing it by breathing properly. But increase? And I better not try the latter.
[09:46:47] <gilberth> Proper breathing also helps with panic attacks.
[09:49:17] <moon-child> heartbeat _should_ increase e.g. during exercise.  Obviously lower resting rate is bettere
[09:49:53] <White_Flame> last time I measured my blood pressure, my BPM was 62
[09:50:08] <White_Flame> but I do need to get _some_ exercise, even with a good number.  I get zeroo
[09:50:58] <moon-child> I try to exercise.  With varying degrees of success.  Usually greater than zero, but not by very much
[09:51:00] <White_Flame> also losing the gut I gained from having to stop exercising, without exercising :-P
[09:52:40] <gilberth> Climbing stairs is enough exercise for me right now. I can take two stair cases at once more often. In January I still needed to take breaks on the stairs, couldn't make it in one go. And that's only one floor.
[09:53:38] <gilberth> And I still have a hard time not losing weight.
[09:56:31] <White_Flame> I still think that's smoking related
[09:56:42] <White_Flame> just from tons of correlation I've seen
[09:57:20] <gilberth> Was the same way even at times I didn't smoke. Genetics have a say, too.
[09:58:29] <White_Flame> yeah, I've always been thin
[09:58:40] <White_Flame> but age does slow things down
[09:58:41] <gilberth> What smoking does though is to dampen appetite.
[09:59:41] <White_Flame> nicotine is also a stimulant (and depressant)
[10:01:28] <gilberth> Anyhow, my body has its own idea of an ideal weight. There isn't much I can do to change it.
[10:02:21] <White_Flame> oh I'm sure if I strapped you into a chair and poured chocolate syrup down your gullet nonstop every day that you might gain something
[10:02:53] <gilberth> Wanna bet? :-)
[10:03:06] <White_Flame> sure ;)
[10:04:24] <gilberth> Well, I once increased my daily kcal intake by like 1500kcal for months. Effect? None.
[10:07:09] <gilberth> What I also have read about people gaining weight, when they quit smoking, is that they just eat more, perhaps using food as a substitute drug.

[23:46:28] <gilberth> I wonder whether invalid HTML not sticking to the syntax still is an issue. It was a night mare in the early days.
[23:47:40] <gilberth> Some behaviour of Netscape actually made it into the HTML5 "spec" though.

[23:52:11] <gilberth> But the so called spec still defines a syntax, which makes some input invalid.
[23:58:43] <gilberth> And it still does not fully describe what the duopol of render engines do.
