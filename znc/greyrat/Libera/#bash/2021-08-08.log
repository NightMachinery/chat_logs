[04:31:01] <neshpion> when a script encounters an error, e.g. `declare -i pi=3.14`, it stops executing, right?  i have a script i'm testing and when i get to a line where i assign 3.14 to a declared integer var, bash has a syntax error, BUT what confuses me is this happens about 100 lines *before* i trap EXIT, yet when the script exits it executes my trap.  i expected it wouldn't execute the trap;  i have other conditions
[04:31:04] <neshpion> in which i exit before the script reaches the `trap` line, and it doesn't trap
[04:31:13] <neshpion> why does it trigger my trapped function on EXIT when it encounters a syntax error?
[04:35:43] <jsrnop> I may be misunderstanding the question, but if you trap EXIT then any exit call will trigger your trap function

[04:37:09] <neshpion> well i'm currently working on making sure *all* of my options/args/environment is setup correctly, so i have `trap cleanup EXIT` at the *very bottom* of my script as it exists right now.  i have some conditions in which i `exit` and the trap doesn't fire, but when bash has a syntax error, at what seems to me to be long before it encounters the line that sets up the trap, it actually does trap
[04:37:50] <neshpion> i thought maybe bash combs the script looking for traps first, and then runs it, but if that were true then when i `exit` it would also trap, but it doesn't
[04:38:07] <neshpion> unless there's a special case in which it combs for traps in the event of a syntax error

[04:44:47] <jsrnop> It's unusual to put the trap commands at the end of the script; usually you want them first to ensure the behavior is "locked if" before those signals can be called (e.g. ERR or EXIT). I looked through the docs and can't tell if the trap command is parsed specially or out of order or not.

[04:53:57] <jsrnop> Ok so the `declare` command has an exit code and I don't think it will generate a bash syntax error ( you can check syntax using `bash -n <yourscript.sh>`). If that's the case, and if you haven't `set -E`, then the script continues on as usual until it reaches the trap command. Then it sets up the trap for EXIT. Then, since you say there are not
[04:53:57] <jsrnop> more commands, it exits, which triggers the EXIT trapped function.

[05:12:34] <neshpion> the error was being thrown by a line inside a function, so i guess it just causes the function to return.  my `while getopts` loop broke because getopts "fails if ... an error occurs";  and i have a check for a custom `err` var after it, which gets set in the function i was calling, but only after the variable assignment, so if that errs then my `err` doesn't get set so my error handling didn't fire.
[05:12:37] <neshpion>  i just defaulted to setting `err` in the function beforehand, and resetting it if the assignment went ok, and this causes my error handling to work again

[06:10:00] <rtn0> hello all
[06:10:11] <rtn0> what's the most straightforward way to...
[06:10:45] <rtn0> ...list all files including all files of all subdirs, beneath a given dir, and then sort them by file size (biggest at top)?
[06:11:20] <rtn0> hopefully if there is a command which simly *does* this, then there is no need for me to use a script or anything
[06:12:25] <rtn0> can ls do this
[06:12:40] <rtn0> using a flag or somethign
[06:13:08] <rtn0> */*?
[06:13:15] <rtn0> i just looked it up on stackexchange
[06:13:57] <phogg> the only way I know is to use find with -printf and a pipe to sort, then strip the non-filename parts

[06:25:14] <phogg> first of all, (?!) is PCRE and won't work with -regex (with the default regextype)
[06:25:48] <phogg> second, if that ls command is really what you ran then it won't return the files you described (unless they're in a subdirectory that matched)

[06:47:52] <DynV> "find . -maxdepth 1 -name 'FO4-*-85pc.jpg' ! \( -name 'FO4-Loriya-*' -o -name 'FO4-Orin-*' \)" works, since there are multiple files matching "FO4-Loriya-*" and "FO4-Orin-*", would it take less processing to use "FO4-Loriya-*-85pc.jpg" and "FO4-Orin-*-85pc.jpg" or it wouldn't matter since it only work with the initial filter that only keep what end with "-85pc.jpg" ?

[08:32:43] <greybot> jaggz: The special option -- means "end of options" to every POSIX command except echo and test, and to many other commands. E.g. Â«mv -- *.png /somedirÂ» (in case one of the filenames begins with "-"). See <http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap12.html#tag_12_02> and <http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/dict/terms/end_of_options>
[08:33:08] <phy1729> I didn't use more and would waste brain cycles deciding on which commands to prefix with a space
[08:33:34] <phy1729> I didn't want a bunch of volume change commands in my history; now I just have no history
[08:34:07] <jaggz> can one make a command strip itself out of history?
[08:34:41] <phy1729> Dunno about in bash, but I could do that, but the utility just wasn't there for me
[08:34:50] <jaggz> or otherwise have some decision made (other than space) as to whether it's included or not?
[08:36:23] <jaggz> I don't use that many repeated commands like volset from commandline
[08:36:30] <jaggz> (since i have volume keys on my kb)
[08:37:40] <phy1729> I have a rather overdesigned function that gradually changes the volume to the set points given (and optionally kills the term once it's done) (and defaults to my usual volume)

[20:12:53] <gtr> Hi, what does $! do in bash? Especially in the context of 'wait "$!"'
[20:14:04] <tirnanog> !$!
[20:14:05] <greybot> $! expands to the process ID of the most recently executed background (asynchronous) command. In bash 4.4 and later this includes process substitutions.
[20:14:20] <tirnanog> essentially, to wait for that.
[20:16:36] <tirnanog> taking process substitutions as an example, there was no way to reap the exit status value of anything run therein until 4.4. at least, not without rolling one's own method of communicating this value. so that's one use case.
