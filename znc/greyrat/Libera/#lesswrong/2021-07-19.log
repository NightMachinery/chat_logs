[12:29:37] <dbohdan> "Eat lead, unempathetic scum!"
[12:29:40] <shawwwn> one time he stomped on a puppy in a grocery store
[12:29:57] <shawwwn> I couldn't believe my eyes. I went up to him and he just kept saying "what? what?"
[12:30:17] <shawwwn> I said "you stomped on a puppy" "what?"
[12:30:22] <shawwwn> and then he stomped on my toes and ran away

[12:30:43] <shawwwn> I still have the scars from that day
[12:32:19] <dbohdan> One can be highly empathetic and stomp on puppies in order to deeply empathize with their suffering
[12:32:28] <saturn2> i only did it because the puppy was racist
[12:32:58] <nshepperd2> > "empathy" as I now know it (ability to read others' emotions as legible) and "empathy" as I've heard it (nicey ALWAYYYYS give people anything they waaaaaant if they say that'll save them from hurt)
[12:33:35] <nshepperd2> if you ask a bunch of people, half of them will tell you that one is empathy and the other is sympathy [you idiot], and the other half will say it's the other way around
[12:39:07] <saturn2> "Sympathy and empathy share a root, the Greek word pathos (meaning "feelings, emotion"), and likewise have some similarity in meaning. Sympathy describes the act or capacity of sharing the feelings of another person; empathy may indicate less emotional closeness (understanding how another person may feel, without necessarily sharing their emotion)."
[12:39:41] <saturn2> so now i know which half of the population i'm an idiot to

[12:42:10] <nshepperd2> note that neither of those definitions necessarily involves actually caring about the other person's feelings, so there's a whole other axis to randomly ascribe to the two words
[12:42:50] <dbohdan> Obormot\Arcturus: People often (usually?) call something "dangerous" to assert their morals, but are you saying it is inherently a moralistic claim to call something "dangerous"?  I don't think it is.  It can be a mere prediction: "based on past cases, we know that if you do X, you will often get a bad outcome".
[12:43:35] <dbohdan> ("Bad" relative to your goals.)
[12:47:18] <nshepperd2> it seems worse from a selfish point of view to be charged with negligent manslaughter for leaving a gun lying around than to have $500 stolen
[12:48:31] <nshepperd2> latter is probably more likely though i guess
[12:48:49] <saturn2> the implication being that if you don't gimme what i want, it's not because you reasonably chose not to but because you're incapable of caring about other people. but after repeated use it can become a free-floating magic word that means gimme, without anyone knowing why
[12:49:23] <dbohdan> The word "dangerous" also was a distinct ancient-feeling context-independent meaning of "may cause bodily harm"
[12:55:16] <saturn2> it seems that there are those empathy protects but does not bind, and those that it binds but does not protect. so empathy is the same thing as conservatism
[12:56:04] <saturn2> i wasn't expecting that but the math checks out

[13:11:51] <saturn2> do gas stoves not emit carbon?
[13:16:46] <Obormot\Gaia> Is it better if you burn coal to generate electricity to power an electric stove, or burn natural gas in a gas stove
[13:17:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway gas stoves are the best
[13:18:35] <saturn2> the coal burning has to stop too obviously
[13:19:00] <Gurkenglas> i... think gas stoves are negligible in their usage, but suppose it's not
[13:19:31] <Gurkenglas> moving more power generation to the grid would increase returns on lobbying
[13:19:57] <saturn2> the eventual goal is to not have a residential gas supply at all
[13:20:35] <Gurkenglas> using the gas hookups that your neighbor already has can't be too costly. but sure, when you're constructing a new neighborhood it makes sense to leave that out
[13:21:29] <saturn2> the existing pipes would still be in the ground but they would not supply gas
[13:21:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok, well, I oppose that
[13:21:57] <saturn2> you could still buy it in tanks if you really wanted it
[13:22:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> The proponents of banning gas stoves ought to provide a substitute that's at least as good, else I am against this sort of thing
[13:22:58] <Gurkenglas> coal generation wastes 2/3 of the chemical energy as heat, right? that'd be better spent to heat the house
[13:23:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> A good point
[13:23:41] <Gurkenglas> Obormot\Arcturus, would you be more in favor of levying a carbon tax?
[13:23:52] <Gurkenglas> Obormot\Arcturus, take care not to treat arguments as soldiers
[13:24:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> Of course, in the winter it's reversed
[13:24:10] <saturn2> i'm a proponent of nuclear powered stoves that stay on all the time and are always preheated. but there are a lot of hearts and minds to be won over yet
[13:24:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> The leaked heat means that you need to run the AC more
[13:24:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> And spend more electricity and so on
[13:24:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> er
[13:24:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> In the summer
[13:24:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: No, I would not be in favor of a carbon tax
[13:25:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Preheating is not the only or even the main problem
[13:25:19] <Gurkenglas> how would you suggest we combat global warming
[13:25:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> I would first have to be convinced that it needs combating
[13:25:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> Before I ventured to suggest ways to do so
[13:25:48] <saturn2> Obormot\Arcturus: no that's just one of the benefits of direct nuclear heating
[13:26:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Well, what are the others? Can a nuclear stove match a gas stove for heat output? That's the main big difference I've noticed when comparing to electrics...
[13:26:42] <Gurkenglas> Obormot\Arcturus, would you be easier to convince that it needs combating if the means to combat didn't go against your deontology?
[13:26:50] <saturn2> absolutely! you wouldn't believe how much heat output could be possible
[13:26:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't have any deontology
[13:27:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Would there be side effects, like EMI, or death
[13:27:45] <Gurkenglas> -your deontology+you
[13:28:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: I don't really understand what you're asking, with that substitution
[13:28:29] <Gurkenglas> do you believe we don't need to combat it because that'd be inconvenient to believe?
[13:28:34] <saturn2> the only limit would be the flash point pf your kitchen walls

[13:28:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Hmm sounds like gas is still the way to go... :p
[13:30:10] <saturn2> and not using a nuclear stove will not save you from death
[13:30:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well... that's true
[13:32:33] <Gurkenglas> do you believe we don't need to combat it because geoengineering will be a better attack vector if we make it that far? (i agree)
[13:33:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: No, not just that, but you seem to be implying that this is an illegitimate reason to believe that, if I catch your drift? But it seems to me that "combating global warming will be inconvenient to me" is actually a perfectly good reason to oppose combating global warming. Don't you think? I mean, if global warming *won't* inconvenience me, but combating global warming *will* inconvenience me, then why should I
[13:33:08] <Obormot\Arcturus>  support combating global warming? Presumably there are some purely altruistic motivations being implied here, but the onus is surely on you to at least establish the facts involved in those, yes? (Separately from appealing to any altruistic feelings I may or may not have for whoever is supposedly affected by this, such as "people in other countries" or "people born a hundred years from now" etc.)
[13:34:53] <Gurkenglas> i agree that you should oppose the combat more if it inconveniences you; but you should try to figure out how necessary is without paying attention to how inconvenient it is
[13:35:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> As for geoengineering, I have no opinion on that sort of thing as such (apart from a general tendency toward the precautionary principle, but that may be moot here), though I will say that many of the sorts of measures proposed today are clearly just theater and/or religious in nature, rather than being designed for effectiveness (this does not imply that any specific other method is superior, of course)
[13:36:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: I don't think you're getting my point; I am saying that defining "necessary" in a way that specifically *excludes* my own interests is arbitrary and makes little sense
[13:36:33] <Urchin[emacs]> Obormot\Arcturus: how would you not be inconvenienced?
[13:37:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> Urchin[emacs]: By global warming? Well, how would I be? It depends on how much of it there is, right? And what the specific effects are? etc.
[13:37:41] <Gurkenglas> maybe it's even better for our chances if, before all these extinction-level global coordination challenges, we have a bunch of lesser coordination challenges that still max out political effect
[13:37:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> If the sea levels rise so much that Brooklyn is fully submerged, that will be pretty inconvenient, clearly...
[13:38:19] <Gurkenglas> as far as i heard, covid stopped the recent advance of the german racist party
[13:38:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: Basically what I'm saying is, you're taking "global warming is bad" as an assumption, and I am questioning that assumption
[13:39:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> Is it bad? How bad is it? For whom is it bad? And in what way? And so on...

[13:42:48] <Gurkenglas> i see, makes sense. though if we want this discussion to reflect how the global discussion would go if they knew more and thought faster, they seem to be taking as an axiom that externalities should be aggregated

[13:43:28] <nshepperd2> banning gas connections completely, being an infinite tax, seems disproportionate

[13:45:05] <Gurkenglas> maybe the carbon tax money should be used to subsidize one side of a global warming prediction market, so that those who would be hurt by global warming can buy the other side to offset their risk
[13:47:21] <Gurkenglas> or rather, carbon emission certifictes should just exactly be any contract that pays out 1$ if global warming doesn't happen
[13:48:36] <saturn2> nshepperd2: the pipes also leak a lot of methane which is worse than carbon dioxide
[13:49:07] <nshepperd2> hm, maybe they should stop doing that
[13:49:11] <Gurkenglas> and then someone, call em "china", who previously just wouldn't have entered into the global initative to enforce carbon emission certificates can actively take the other side of the contract and go full on smoke pumping

[14:22:10] <Gurkenglas> saturn2, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_claims_in_Antarctica looks like there are 7 nations to buy it from
[14:22:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> Perhaps
[14:22:12] <Robomot> Territorial claims in Antarctica - Wikipedia (Seven sovereign states have made territorial claims in Antarctica, which are Argentina, Australia, Chile, France, New Zealand, Norway and the United Kingdom. …)
[14:22:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> We don't have such advanced tech though
[14:23:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: Anyway, China has already been taking over Siberia
[14:23:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: So they'd just accelerate their efforts
[14:24:01] <nshepperd2> Gurkenglas: see, even geoengineering is easier than convincing everyone to get along
[14:25:00] <saturn2> Gurkenglas: these claims are unrecognized by anyone in a position to defend them
[14:25:50] <saturn2> i might as well claim all of antactica for myself. it's mine now
[14:26:07] <saturn2> i'll start the bidding at $2.49
[14:26:16] <nshepperd2> i'll take two
[14:27:04] <Gurkenglas> saturn2, if China goes to some other country and pays them money for a piece of paper with "Claim to Antartica" on it that's more likely to be recognized, though, so they'd want to do that
[14:27:20] <Gurkenglas> in fact, they might want to buy exactly the north pole because then they can pay lots of countries
[14:27:22] <Gurkenglas> *south
[14:27:29] <Gurkenglas> all of which would be incentivized to play along
[14:30:07] <Urchin[emacs]> Obormot\Arcturus: one guy from Sussex does not consensus make
[14:31:02] <quanticle> Gurkenglas: The main problem with climate change that Obormot\Arcturus is pointing to is that it's unclear how one would falsify climate change to an average person. Bad weather happens? Yes, but bad weather happens all the time. You're going to need to do better than that.
[14:31:41] <nshepperd2> is the average person too dumb to understand order statistics and non-stationary processes
[14:31:43] <quanticle> And for the record, I don't think there are any climate models that show Brooklyn going underwater, at least not within the next 150 years.
[14:32:27] <quanticle> nshepperd2: 1. Quite possibly yes 2. See above re: impact. The sea level rises that the UN ICPP projects... aren't actually that bad.
[14:32:57] <nshepperd2> i guess the average person is incapable of holding an informed view on climate change then
[14:33:32] <quanticle> Sure, which is why I think this whole prevention business is fruitless. Much better to do what we always do and adapt.
[14:34:00] <quanticle> saturn2: Consider this a declaration of war, for Antarctica
[14:34:03] <quanticle> I will take it from you
[14:34:07] <quanticle> By force
[14:34:44] <nshepperd2> nah prevention is entirely possible, you just have to use methods that only require non-dumb people
[14:35:10] <nshepperd2> like carbon sequestration by enhanced olivine weathering
[14:36:14] <quanticle> I suppose
[14:36:35] <Urchin[emacs]> Obormot\Arcturus: also, the discussion about Brits dying of cold is Brits being incompetent at dealing with cold, as it's usually just not cold enough for them to pull out coats, gloves and warm headgear, a cultural failing, something similar happens with heat in Dalmatia, as being properly outfited to deal with heat in Dalmatia is considered odd, so frowned upon, it's really selective bullshit

[14:44:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> Urchin[emacs]: Alright, but you can do this with anything
[14:45:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Dying of heat? Maybe you should be better at building a wealthy society that can provide AC-equipped housing to all citizens
[14:45:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's a cultural failing"
[14:46:28] <Urchin[emacs]> Obormot\Arcturus: I'm talking about clothes, it's fairly well known
[14:46:48] <Urchin[emacs]> Obormot\Arcturus: brits covered it in documentaries
[14:47:50] <nshepperd2> actually it's good if the dumbest british people die of cold, it's eugenic
[14:48:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> nshepperd2: What if we apply that logic on a global scale
[14:48:09] <Urchin[emacs]> Obormot\Arcturus: they just don't wear clothes that's warm enough and end up with blood clots
[14:49:06] <nshepperd2> Obormot\Arcturus: what if
[14:50:45] <nshepperd2> if the dumbest countries die of cold it's not ideal, because countries tend to have guns and armies
[14:51:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hmm
[14:51:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> But the dumbest countries have the fewest guns and weakest armies, don't they?
[14:51:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway, we're talking about dying of *heat*
[14:52:03] <nshepperd2> either way this is just saturn2's point
[14:52:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> What if the pros and cons of global warming are "eugenics vs. politics"
[14:52:46] <RiversHaveWings> oh no. https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9800091/Spoiled-rich-man-slammed-tweeting-resents-parents-giving-100k.html

[14:58:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Back when Trump had recently been elected, I overheard a conversation from someone in I guess my larger peer group who was considering South Africa as a potential escape if things got bad. (The specific concern there was anti-Semitism; South Africa has a sizeable Jewish community.) I thought that was a really questionable idea in all sorts of ways. I am not actually glad to have that validated."
[14:59:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> Imagine being an American Jew and going "you know what's a safer place for me, with less anti-semitism than America? South Africa, that's what"

[15:37:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok I guess I don't feel bad about QC
[15:38:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> Maybe this is just more privilege
[15:38:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> I confess that "parents just hand you $100k for your birthday" is so far beyond my experience that I can't process it sufficiently to have any feelings about it
[15:38:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well, whatever, his LW posts are still dumb
[15:39:28] <rsaarelm> I started thinking about just how much price distortion there is for Bay Area with the crazy costs of living.
[15:40:01] <rsaarelm> Like, is there enought that $100k actually feels like a significantly less crazy sum there.
[15:40:31] <rsaarelm> Same as how $100 in Switzerland isn't quite the same as $100 somewhere in the third world.
[15:43:24] <saturn2> the median yearly income for a working adult is something like $35k
[15:43:37] <rsaarelm> Like, my ballpark for a generous "keep your perma-unemployed adult kid fed and housed" annual stipend wound be something like $10k.
[15:44:07] <feep[work]> yeah uh, that *strongly* depends on region
[15:44:08] <rsaarelm> Yeah, and those people are mostly priced out of the Bay Area as far as I understand.
[15:44:27] <feep[work]> like, in germany, in a maybe 100km region around munich that would p much barely pay for rent.
[15:44:27] <rsaarelm> 1 order of magnitude isn't *that* much.
[15:45:21] <rsaarelm> Right, yeah, rent is tricky.
[15:45:36] <feep[work]> I mean straight up, no food, no clothes
[15:45:44] <feep[work]> literally just rent, maybe power too
[15:46:36] <feep[work]> (though to be fair munich is p much germany's bay area)
[15:46:40] <rsaarelm> You can buy stupid cheap apartments in places where nobody really wants to live.
[15:47:07] <feep[work]> ( see the rent map https://www.atlasbig.com/de-de/deutschland-mietspiegel that inflamed red pimple is munich )
[15:47:07] <Robomot> Deutschland Mietspiegel Karte  - AtlasBig.com (Deutschland Mietspiegel Karte)
[15:47:15] <saturn2> being comfortably unemployed in SF pretty much *is* a huge luxury
[15:47:57] <rsaarelm> I guess if you want to keep the kid within bus distance of where you live instead of sending the source of shame to your esteemed house to the colonies, that'll cost extra.
[15:48:20] <feep[work]> yeah
[15:48:49] <rsaarelm> Why is München so much hotter spot than Berlin?
[15:48:54] <feep[work]> when I was looking for an apartment in munich, I eventually worked out that "rent plus twice daily public transportation to munich" was p much exactly a conserved quantity.
[15:49:07] <feep[work]> rsaarelm: germany is like ...
[15:49:11] <feep[work]> take san francisco
[15:49:15] <feep[work]> and move all the tech to munich
[15:49:17] <feep[work]> and all the hobos to berlin.
[15:50:02] <Gurkenglas> is there a place where nobody wants to live because theres nothing there where we can send remote workers without 1. buying the whole place ahead of time 2. letting someone extract rent as soon as 150 cool people moved there?
[15:50:19] <rsaarelm> My model of every European country is that the capital region is sorta like an actual city, then there are three or four places that pretend they're real cities that everyone makes fun of and everything else is the filming set of Deliverance.
[15:50:38] <feep[work]> rsaarelm: right, but germany is different in that munich is sorta like an actual city and berlin is what everyone makes fun of.
[15:50:41] <saturn2> Gurkenglas: um... how would that work?
[15:51:00] <Gurkenglas> saturn2, the part where you dont get rent extraction?
[15:51:08] <saturn2> are you just asking if there's a place that has georgism?
[15:51:42] <rsaarelm> Right, so it's like how you have the capital that's some fucksville and the actual main city is something else?
[15:52:02] <rsaarelm> Like Brazil has Brasilia and nobody goes there.
[15:52:12] <Gurkenglas> some place with georgism would be a good idea but that doesn't need to be the solutio
[15:52:31] <saturn2> what's the other solution?
[15:52:33] <Gurkenglas> there could just be some clever trick. maybe make all the houses mobile and then if rent extraction comes along you move
[15:52:40] <Gurkenglas> or something we havent thought of yet
[15:52:41] <saturn2> lol
[15:53:02] <saturn2> well you can buy a mobile home
[15:53:17] <saturn2> no one is stopping you?
[15:53:36] <Gurkenglas> maybe that's more inefficient than another, easier trick.
[15:54:17] <saturn2> rationalist fleet was a cool idea, maybe it could work if someone less crazy were in charge
[15:54:39] <rsaarelm> Hm, trailer park intentional community.
[15:54:48] <Gurkenglas> you could just have a contract that says rent can't go up, but surely thats like trying to stop water with a sieve
[15:55:25] <saturn2> oh, there are plenty of places with rent control
[15:55:48] <Gurkenglas> does it solve the rent extraction problem?
[15:56:00] <saturn2> you just have to be prepared to win whatever other rationing contest controls access
[15:57:17] <Gurkenglas> aka a rationalist homeowners association that decides who gets in
[15:57:51] <saturn2> i think you have to buy the whole place ahead of time to establis a HOA
[15:57:59] <saturn2> +h
[15:58:05] <Gurkenglas> then not literally an hoa
[15:58:40] <Gurkenglas> presumably all the places with rent control are already not possible to move a community to
[16:00:26] <Gurkenglas> so, we move to the middle of nowhere owned by Mr. Nobody. We write up a contract that we pay him a modest rent that can't go up, and that we can rent more land in a spiral around that spot as we need it

[19:29:10] <gwern> ...but doesn't lower the constant because everywhere the cheaper or faster transit now reaches, rents just rise to the constant,

[20:58:24] <rsaarelm> I think the OSR gaming aesthetic ("rulings not rules", "player skill over character skill", "you're not meant to be able to kill everything, play smart") is cool regardless of how historically accurate it is.
[20:58:35] <rsaarelm> Yeah, that stuff.
[20:58:50] <Logos01> Like legit the *instant* it got sorted out it started becoming crunchy -- because that actually worked better.
[20:59:39] <Logos01> rsaarelm: The problem with the "rulings not rules" thing is that it developed extremely insularly and groups would blow up and not be able to reform with anyone else allllll the tiiime.
[20:59:40] <rsaarelm> I figure there was some unique energy when you had to actually think about what you want to be accomplishing and come up with ways to do it in the game, instead of just having a ready-made tradition of How It's Done that you can apply without thinking about the underlying design princilpes.
[21:00:24] <rmmh> aren't there RPGs that go more freeform than crunchy? isn't Exalted like that?
[21:00:30] <Logos01> Not to mention it would usually boil down to "who is the most charismatic, and who does the game-runner like the most?"

[21:03:06] <rsaarelm> It also kinda depends on if you're playing a social-heavy plot or a gritty dungeon crawl.
[21:03:21] <rsaarelm> I figure dungeon crawls would be more about physical improvisation than social.
[21:04:03] <rsaarelm> And luckily elaborate repeated megadungeon crawls over social storygames are also part of the OSR aesthetic.

[21:41:44] <Logos01> No amount of purely economic activity can address it.
[21:41:52] <ggreer> thinking from first principles, it makes sense that mRNA is more effective. some people have already been exposed to the adenovirus (or something similar enough that they're effectively immune). their bodies kill off the delivery vehicle before it can manufacture much of the payload (the spike protein)

[21:53:42] <Logos01> ggreer: "We have laws about driving while sleepy or intoxicated" -- and we have special laws that cover those who drive professionally because the regular laws were not sufficiently effective.
[21:54:01] <kuudes> before the reform the taxis were part of public transit, and had a duty to accept all passengers
[21:54:06] <kuudes> now they can choose
[21:54:11] <Logos01> Anyhoo.
[21:54:42] <ggreer> for truckers and others who drive alone, that can make sense. (though I assume insurance companies and trucking companies would limit hours to reduce their costs)
[21:54:54] <kuudes> externalities
[21:55:06] <ggreer> kuudes: yes. insurance covers externalities
[21:55:08] <shawwwn> “Make my paste longer,” gwern said in a sultry voice.

[21:55:18] <kuudes> no they don't
[21:55:30] <ggreer> that is literally the point of liability insurance
[21:55:33] <kuudes> if my spouse gets killed by a truck, it does not make it much better if I get a million for it
[21:55:59] <ggreer> therefore ban all trucks? I don't know what you're trying to say
[21:56:08] <kuudes> no, just that I like current situation
[21:56:16] <kuudes> because less people get killed by trucks
[21:56:17] <shawwwn> I for one hope all the trucks are banned
[21:56:26] <rmmh> I want lifted trucks to get banned
[21:56:30] <ggreer> where trucks aren't allowed to be self-driving because the EU is technophobic?
[21:56:42] <rmmh> crazy to be driving around in a normal car and your eyes are grill-level with a ridiculous vehicle
[21:56:54] <two2thehead> rmmh, yep

[21:57:13] <kuudes> and we have already self driving bus experiments etc
[21:57:18] <ggreer> yeah it is. EU limits the maximum lateral acceleration that these technologies can do. it also limits lane changes in various ways
[21:57:29] <ggreer> it basically causes teslas to run off the road
[21:57:35] <kuudes> that seems different than banning it altogether
[21:57:47] <kuudes> can't teslas brake for lane change?
[21:57:49] <ggreer> it's worse than a ban. it's a "self drive except fuck up in the worst time"
[21:57:53] <ggreer> lateral acceleration
[21:57:58] <kuudes> sideways?
[21:58:03] <ggreer> that is what lateral means
[21:58:07] <kuudes> yes. so brake
[21:58:10] <kuudes> that is not sideways
[21:58:15] <kuudes> then you don't drive off road
[21:58:40] <ggreer> the lateral acceleration is 3m/s^2, which is a very very gentle turn. if you drove like that, you'd get a ton of traffic backed up behind you
[21:58:49] <kuudes> the blocks are not the issue
[21:58:55] <kuudes> the driving off road is
[21:58:56] <ggreer> because you'd be going half the speed limit around each corner
[21:59:00] <kuudes> don't drive off road, cause jams
[21:59:02] <kuudes> uyews
[21:59:09] <kuudes> that is the point
[21:59:18] <shawwwn> This reminds me of an #lw-gpt debate
[21:59:20] <rmmh> I like how kuudes will never admit that any EU law might be wrong
[21:59:26] <ggreer> also the lane change thing is due to an EU law that says the lane change must be completed within 5 seconds of the start of signalling. if it's not finished by then, it has to go back to the original lane
[21:59:29] <shawwwn> Kuudes vs ggreer
[21:59:32] <shawwwn> For an hour
[21:59:42] <rmmh> it's fun because I don't actually care how the EU decides to ruin everything
[21:59:42] <kuudes> why do you care for eu laws, you don't live here
[21:59:46] <kuudes> be happy with your locale
[21:59:48] <shawwwn> About something incomprehensible
[21:59:49] <rmmh> unlike an argument for US laws
[22:00:04] <kuudes> you don't have to even sell teslas to eu
[22:00:05] <ggreer> I have to click "accept all" on cookie notifications
[22:00:15] <rmmh> ggreer: "self-driving cars in europe aren't allowed to drive like people" kuudes: "that's what they deserve"
[22:00:17] <ggreer> and I spent several months of my life fixing some gdpr bullshit
[22:00:31] <kuudes> you don't have to do that if you ip ban eu
[22:00:39] <rmmh> ip banning the eu feels so good
[22:00:40] <feep> ggreer: you do not have to click accept all
[22:00:42] <kuudes> cut off the internet and be happy by yourself
[22:00:50] <ggreer> XD
[22:00:59] <feep> and you don't need gdpr if you don't store pii

[22:01:31] <shawwwn> I for one already know ggreer’s IP address

[22:01:58] <ggreer> if you want to serve people in south africa, you have to follow south africa laws
[22:02:02] <kuudes> yes
[22:02:11] <ggreer> this is true but the laws can also be stupid and counterproductive
[22:02:12] <kuudes> you don't have to serve people in south africa or eu
[22:02:15] <kuudes> no one is forcing you to
[22:02:28] <shawwwn> I for one am forcing him to
[22:02:31] <feep> I think the laws are good.
[22:02:35] <kuudes> me too
[22:03:12] <ggreer> and you're basically rationalizing any EU law to be good. if the EU decided to start cutting off the pinky toes of kindergartners, you'd probably find some way to justify it
[22:03:25] <kuudes> I would really like to be able to just prevent any data of mine to ever ending up into usa
[22:03:34] <ggreer> then don't chat with americans
[22:03:36] <feep> I would not.
[22:03:38] <feep> Lots of EU laws are shit.
[22:03:40] <kuudes> but the bastards there seem to bend over backwards to get my data
[22:03:43] <feep> The GDPR, *specifically* is good.
[22:03:57] <shawwwn> Lol yes, the “we must inform you we have cookies” law
[22:04:00] <feep> if the us did a gdpr, I would praise the US.
[22:04:01] <shawwwn> So good
[22:04:08] <kuudes> shawwwn, that is different law than gdpr
[22:04:13] <feep> shawwwn: hey, thanks to gdpr I can now opt out of cookies
[22:04:14] <shawwwn> Is it? Ah
[22:04:14] <kuudes> cookie stuff is in eprivacy
[22:04:16] <feep> and I do that all the time.
[22:04:18] <ggreer> GDPR has ended the EU's tech competitiveness. VC investment is half what it was before the law
[22:04:25] <kuudes> which also says the companies are not allowed to read the private comms
[22:04:33] <kuudes> or insert http-injection ads etc

[22:06:30] <rmmh> ...who has a locked yard?
[22:07:02] <shawwwn> Who among us has a locked yard?
[22:07:13] <shawwwn> Me, I say
[22:07:16] <catern> GDPR is bad, what's the libertarian answer for how to get privacy? or I guess it's just paternalism, forcing people to buy privacy they don't want to buy
[22:07:18] <shawwwn> My yard is totally locked
[22:07:20] <rmmh> putting a lock on something with a 3-6ft fence is kind of ridiculous
[22:07:30] * feep glances at the paper
[22:07:38] <feep> what exactly are "ventures whose products tend to be more reliant on data"?
[22:07:39] <shawwwn> Actually we live next to a golf course
[22:07:44] <catern> actually, the libertarian answer is super obvious, it's the internet: host your own stuff
[22:08:17] <catern> what I really hate about GDPR is that it's a step towards reducing the big openness of computers, to be like every other field where you can't do anything
[22:08:52] <feep> what I like about the GDPR is that it's a step towards pushing the openness of computers in a way that's independent of persistent, cross-linked identities.
[22:08:53] <rmmh> it's worse than that, it paralyzes people by having vague requirements
[22:09:10] <kuudes> it didn't change about anything on eu companies
[22:09:16] <kuudes> because the law existed already since 80s
[22:09:24] <catern> rmmh: exactly
[22:09:26] <kuudes> it just harmonized them into one eu regulation
[22:09:37] <kuudes> so that you could move your business within eu and know the law

[22:09:57] <catern> kuudes: who cares? it's bad either way
[22:10:06] <kuudes> I don't think it is
[22:10:14] <catern> big surprise
[22:10:16] <kuudes> gdpr and similar are things why we have faster and cheaper internet in finland
[22:10:25] <kuudes> in usa things seem to suck in that
[22:10:48] <kuudes> they don't need to suck, but I guess revealed preferences etc
[22:11:07] <feep> "websites reduced their connections, particularly involving personal data, to web technology providers after GDPR's rollout"
[22:11:07] <kuudes> like, when covid came, we could just move 3/4 of adults to work from home because everyone had internet
[22:11:10] <feep> so far I'm only seeing upsides...
[22:12:03] <kuudes> yes, it indeed limits individual ownership rights when the office of communications can order a mobile base station to be built on your roof
[22:12:05] <gwern> 'The pageant was conceived as America’s answer to Oberammergau, a passion play performed in Bavaria since 1634—it continues to this day—in which local people reenact Jesus’s last days.'
[22:12:07] <kuudes> but the upside is that comms work
[22:12:09] <catern> if the EU is willing to gut their technology industry, how about they do it by getting rid of software copyright or software patents or something actually useful?
[22:12:17] <feep> I am also for this
[22:12:21] <kuudes> gdpr did not change much anything, catern 
[22:12:24] <feep> but I don't think this is a societal net loss.
[22:12:25] <catern> that would be much nicer than this stupid weary-giant-of-flesh-and-steel regulation garbage
[22:12:26] <kuudes> the law was that way already
[22:12:42] <kuudes> it just wrote out the law so that americans etc could not claim ignorance
[22:12:44] <feep> like, what I'm reading here is that the eu is gutting its cross-site tracking and ad placement industry
[22:12:52] <feep> which -- good.
[22:12:53] <kuudes> so that they had to follow the same laws as european companies
[22:13:18] <kuudes> feep, they are also moving onward to gut the tracking industry in itself
[22:13:22] <feep> sweet
[22:13:27] <kuudes> ie make tracking opt-in
[22:14:17] <shawwwn> It’s now been two hours of fighting about tracking
[22:14:40] <kuudes> no
[22:14:57] <catern> sorry I just came in here at the end, I didn't meant to revitalize this inane debate which clearly has been done to death already
[22:15:04] <kuudes> at most 50 minutes
[22:15:09] <rmmh> gdpr also has a dumb name
[22:15:17] <rmmh> they need to come up with shnazzy acronyms
[22:15:22] <kuudes> I dislike those
[22:15:23] <rmmh> maybe if they had lobbyists they wouldn't have this problem
[22:15:26] <gwern> 'I found it impossible to forget that this story had been written less than two centuries ago: the whole religion was as recent an invention as the lawn mower.'
[22:16:19] <rmmh> the lawn mower destroyed the sheeps and the ha-has :(

[22:17:40] <galambo> OK I have done some research on AI funds. it seems most of the good ones are in the USA. but I found one that is UCITS (ie one that works in the UK and europe). its called L&G Artificial Intelligence ETF GBP (LSE:AIAG)
[22:18:14] <galambo> it has a nice mix of tech and AI related companies
[22:20:47] <galambo> I am bullish on the progress of AI research, so I should probably invest in it
[22:21:16] <galambo> (this is not financial advice, actually I am seeking your advice, which is also not financial advice)
[22:22:53] <shawwwn> Ai funds?
[22:23:07] <gwern> (apparently electric riding lawn mowers have gotten really good. that's useful to know for when ours dies)
[22:23:13] <shawwwn> Like, it uses AI to decide what to invest in next?
[22:23:34] <shawwwn> Oh yes gwern, we’re getting a roomba for our lawn
[22:23:38] <shawwwn> You may want to partake too
[22:23:46] <galambo> shawwwn, no. like, it invests in AI companies. the allocation is being done by humans, which is a bit ironic.
[22:24:04] <shawwwn> Ah

[22:24:51] <linear> re: AI funds, so, the way I see it there's 2 huge groups benefitting from AI, one is companies already with huge scale+resources, which is just our large cap tech aka 'faang', and two is various startups that are trying at it on their own, none of which are public. I'm not sure how much the middle ground of mid-caps is really worth, depending on the market, it's a tough problem
[22:25:02] <gwern> shawwwn: when I was looking into robotic lawnmowers 5 years ago orso, I was estimating I'd have to go at least into the $5k+ range and commercial robotic lawn mowers given the size and roughness
[22:25:15] <shawwwn> Nah they got better since then

[22:25:37] <gwern> * that is a real word, thank you very much
[22:25:38] <Dyo> american scythes aren't peened
[22:25:44] <linear> so I feel similar about 'ai funds' as I do 'biotech' funds, it seems difficult to just 'invest in it' in general, without being reallly good at picking winners and losers
[22:26:14] <galambo> linear, this is the list of companies in the fund. what do you think? https://fundcentres.lgim.com/srp/documents-id/8fb44abf-9bb1-44ef-b758-775816534f9c/Fundholdings.csv
[22:26:15] <Robomot> text/csv (10 KB)
[22:26:53] <kuudes> I feel galambo is putting perhaps too much human into his investment for optimal results
[22:27:01] <gwern> 'At its best, retconning can breathe new life into a stagnant franchise; at its worst it’s a cringey affront to the audience’s memory and intelligence, the author scarcely acknowledging some preposterous contradiction with what came before. Think of Star Wars: in The Return of the Jedi Palpatine dies decisively, hurled down a reactor shaft by Darth Vader. But in The Rise of Skywalker, in...
[22:27:07] <gwern> ...a WTF-caliber retcon, he’s simply…back. (“Somehow,” a character remarks airily, “Palpatine returned.”)' <-- more evidence you should never watch the sequels
[22:27:25] <galambo> the fund is missing apple and facebook which is a bit ridiculous tbh
[22:27:37] <linear> galambo: from a very brief look, they seem mostly good, but I'm just not sure how much it is really betting on 'AI'. But I see everything from Amazon to Intuit to Microsoft to Cloudflare to Baidu in there, so I'm sure they're still all GREAT companies and diversity of market caps
[22:28:07] <linear> it's hard to know, valuations are all crazy now anyway, and we don't know to what extent
[22:28:44] <linear> a lot of popular funds like that recently do have pretty high fees too, sometimes 0.5-1%, which you should never pay (you could just buy the stocks yourself! Then you can even loss-harvest and tax-optimize, or customize it) (unless you're getting something too hard to get usually, like leveraged etfs that operate via daily swaps)
[22:28:46] <galambo> linear, I do feel a bit hypocritical because I keep recommending my friends do a global index fund and not pick stocks
[22:29:23] <galambo> linear, this one is 0.49%. and I will be paying a small flat fee to the platform. so its a bit high but not excessively so
[22:30:29] <linear> I view 0.5% as very high, because it is annual *and it compounds with you every single year!*, so you want to probably hold these things for years or even decades
[22:30:38] <linear> so it can easily end up 4-5 figures in fees 
[22:30:44] <galambo> linear, this is also part of what triggered me to consider this course of action: https://www.metaculus.com/questions/7506/return-for-vgt-if-agi-arrives-by-2040/

[22:31:04] <galambo> metaculus thinks the returns will be 15% after inflation
[22:31:12] <galambo> thats over decades but still
[22:31:18] <linear> I am bullish on AI myself, but I find it hard to put it into a good investing thesis unless I am able to write quality angel checks or something, because even nasdaq/qqq already has very high exposure to FAANG, which we know will benefit heavily from this stuff
[22:31:49] <galambo> metaculus is bearish on the s&p 500 even though the s&p 500 is  like 24% tech stocks: https://www.metaculus.com/questions/4615/what-annual-real-return-will-the-sp-500-realize-2022-2031/

[22:32:24] <galambo> linear, yes I considered qqq but I feel this one is better
[22:32:32] <galambo> qqq was missing some big companies
[22:32:40] <linear> yeah, and if you check the composition of nasdaq 100 e.g., it... has only gotten crazier (apple 12%, microsoft 10%, amzn 9%, goog 8%, fb 4%)
[22:32:58] <linear> basically has just turned into not even large-cap but like hyper-extremely-super-large-cap, as companies in the trillions are if you ask me
[22:32:59] <galambo> (I apologise for overcrowding the chat. I can go to overflow if you guys explicitly say you want me to.
[22:35:01] <galambo> I dont know. I think lw people have made good predictions like bitcoin and covid. lw demographic disagrees with the general population on being bullish on AI progress. so I might as well use this sentiment. I also feel excited to put my money in companies I am interested in.
[22:35:40] <galambo> but I would be giving up lots of diversification
[22:35:46] <linear> you meant that to say LW is bullish on AI, while the general population is not? or the opposite
[22:36:11] <galambo> linear, well lw is bullish on ai research progress, but bearish on its consequences
[22:36:47] <linear> it seems okay to think that AI will cause quite a few bad things, but also that investors in tech stocks might still do well
[22:37:31] <galambo> yes I know investing in AI research is horrible. its the opposite of what the AI safety people would want me to do
[22:37:39] <galambo> its not ESG by lw standards
[22:37:59] <galambo> you guys should hate me
[22:38:26] <linear> invest in AI resarch, then spend your returns on helping alignment, what could go wrong
[22:38:46] <linear> but either way, the majority of people DO have a notable stake in these tech companies for better or worse, so..

[22:46:31] <kuudes> 15% over decade does not sound very much
[22:46:44] <kuudes> haven't regular indexes returned something like 14% per year recently?
[22:47:01] <linear> the last few years have been pretty impressive by most standards yeah
[22:47:11] <kuudes> and 100 year average is 6.8%
[22:47:24] <kuudes> so it should get 15% in less than 3 years
[22:48:03] <galambo> kuudes, I thought they meant yearly returns. surely the returns over 30 years wont just be 15%
[22:48:29] <kuudes> if so, then why not just buy berkshire hathaway? it has brought in 20% pa

[22:48:47] <kuudes> but imo you are still putting way too much human in the loop in this
[22:48:51] <kuudes> you are not this good decision maker
[22:49:00] <kuudes> so you should restrict your own effect on the returns

[22:49:37] <kuudes> if you want higher rate of return with higher variance, you should just take loans and invest those
[22:49:59] <kuudes> but its your money
[22:50:14] <galambo> kuudes, I would never take loans. I can never make up the interst and the whole thing is too risky and stressful
[22:50:15] <kuudes> just my opinion that if you are deciding on 100% of your investments you are imo making a mistake
[22:50:40] <kuudes> interest is currently near 0% or under
[22:50:51] <galambo> kuudes, I was thinking maybe 50% s&p 500 and 50% aiag
[22:51:27] <kuudes> multiple low management international index funds for 95% and then 5% per your own vision would be what I would do
[22:51:35] <kuudes> low management fee
[22:51:39] <kuudes> ie < 0.2% at most
[22:52:10] <galambo> kuudes, yes. and that is what I have been doing and telling my friends to do. thats the barbell strategy of nicholas nassim taleb

[22:54:09] <galambo> kuudes, this is something I wrote about mortgages: I [...] feel a bit confused why one would make a leveraged investment and then pay insurance to try to mitigate its volatility. It feels convoluted and needlessly complicated. I also think you will be getting the worst of both worlds: increased risk AND reduced profits. 
[22:54:13] <kuudes> use your current stocks as collateral, they are good for about 60% of their value, and then take a collateralized investment loan, it should be base rate + <1%
[22:54:43] <kuudes> yes, over here most of housing loans are shortest allowed euribor
[22:54:50] <galambo> not to mention the interest you are paying on the mortgage
[22:55:01] <kuudes> well euribor is currently <-0.5%
[22:55:04] <galambo> OK I dont want to talk about mortgages sorry
[22:55:12] <galambo> I think we are deviating
[22:55:14] <linear> re: low-interest loans with stock as collateral, if you pick the right brokerage (e.g. IBKR) you can often invest on margin with as little as 1-2% interest
[22:55:15] <kuudes> I agree
[22:55:21] <kuudes> yes
[22:55:24] <galambo> also I am still happy to go to overflow if you guys want me to
[22:55:39] <kuudes> I sympatize with you btw
[22:56:04] <kuudes> works for me, -overflow I mean
[22:56:16] <galambo> linear, why would I want to invest on margin?
[22:56:23] <kuudes> it hasn't got much use on this side
[22:56:34] <linear> you may not want to, was mostly just mentioning it in relation to what kuudes said about getting a collaterialized investment loan
[22:56:49] <galambo> lifecycle investing actually made an argument of making leveraged investments
[22:57:04] <galambo> like a barbell approach
[22:57:37] <galambo> a significant portion of your portfolio in cash or bonds. and a smaller amount in leveraged stocks
[22:58:00] <galambo> I think they showed this strategy is better than gong 100% stocks without leverage
[22:58:07] <galambo> going*
[22:58:53] <galambo> but I dont want to do leveraged investing because I might get sucked into gambling behavior
[22:59:16] <kuudes> you should not touch your investments but make automated payments and then forget about them
[22:59:37] <linear> I'm a bad person to provide advice since my personal risk tolerance is generally insane and involves 3x ETFs and/or options
[22:59:45] <linear> but it's at least nice to know what options are/are not available
[22:59:45] <kuudes> most investors get lower return than the funds or stocks they invest to have
[23:00:21] <galambo> linear, what is your portfolio if you dont mind me asking (you dont need to say if you are not comfortable)
[23:00:22] <kuudes> yes, the <5% or <1% gambling part should go to such weird stuff
[23:00:47] <linear> galambo: things like SOXL, NET, NVIDIA, currently
[23:01:03] <linear> or NVDA* to keep my line consistent 
[23:01:10] <Logos01> shawwwn: Just now catching up to your Beverly Crusher "TrekNoContext" post.
[23:01:12] <galambo> linear, so you are also invested in AI stocks
[23:01:16] <galambo> or tech stocks
[23:01:18] <linear> pretty much, yeah
[23:01:26] <galambo> so great minds think alike?
[23:01:34] <galambo> or read the same articles :P
[23:01:39] <shawwwn> I love treknocontext
[23:01:41] <linear> perhaps! I'd take the compliment, I certainly think anything related to them is at least not-a-bad-choice
[23:01:45] <Logos01> shawwwn: The amusing part of that being so taken out of context is that she had spent like the leading 40 minutes or so being convinced the problem was with *her*, and only gets to that point after exhaustively ruling herself out.
[23:01:52] <linear> I can fully imagine semiconductors/GPUs/TPUs/whatever just kind of consuming the world over the next decades
[23:02:03] <galambo> linear, exactly my thoughts
[23:02:09] <Logos01> Also that was one of the fuckyoudammitwhyareyouathingWesley episodes.
[23:02:23] <linear> so even if some are super overvalued (maybe?), I'd *like* to try holding them for at least 5-20 years
[23:02:29] <galambo> are you invested in robotics?
[23:02:47] <galambo> so they have insane market caps, but are they overvalued?
[23:03:01] <linear> yeah, hard to answer that, since obviously everyone expects future growth
[23:03:18] <linear> I definitely am not aware of/in many harware-level things though, but might be nice to research for awhile
[23:03:55] <galambo> what platform are you using?
[23:04:16] <galambo> I envy you because you have so many options
[23:04:29] <galambo> in the uk/eu the options are much more limited
[23:05:00] <linear> I use a few US brokerages, I suggest IBKR for people that want lowest margin rate, TDA/Fidelity/Etrade for a lot of normal people, and Robinhood for people that want to put zero thought into anything
[23:05:49] <shawwwn> gwern: “Shawn, I would like to share a minor revelation about ML but the level of prior ignorance it reveals in me is something I’m not yet ready to make public LOL… but I feel comfortable sharing with you, in the spirit of learning together:   
[23:05:49] <shawwwn>    For a while I’ve been trying to understand Attention and why it’s “needed”: I just never saw the need for all the extra vectors & transformations to make up the weighted sum of the attention mechanism, when a simple vanilla MLP does a weighted sum over the input vector anyway.  (The fact that the attention weights normalize to one is IMHO still not a necessary component.)
[23:05:49] <shawwwn> Tonight it hit me: For a vanilla MLP, the weights are the SAME for every input — they don’t “move” or change from input to input (they change during training, but not otherwise..). Sure, the MLP offers a weighted sum, but it’s the same weighted sum of the exact same locations every time. So if all you ever had were images where, say, the animal you’re trying to detect was always in the same location, great. Or if words 
[23:05:49] <shawwwn> in a sentence we’re always in the same order, you could have a “frozen attention”. Otherwise, you’d need essentially weights that are computed on the fly in response to the inputs, and THAT “weights on the fly” effect is what’s achieved via the dot product between the inputs and the query in the Attention mechanism.   
[23:05:49] <shawwwn>  ….Ok thanks for letting me share. Happy to receive your comments or feedback…?”
[23:06:13] <shawwwn> I for one have no idea
[23:06:58] <gwern> shawwwn: now, ask him how *MLP-Mixer* works :)
[23:07:17] <shawwwn> Well, is he right?
[23:07:19] <galambo> linear, interesting. I only know fidelity out of those.
[23:07:34] <galambo> you obviously dont use vanguard because the options are too limited
[23:07:51] <galambo> I tend to recommend vanguard to people
[23:07:55] <linear> yeah, haven't used them. 'thanks' to robhinhood, stock purchases are generally always $0, so unless someone has specific desires, the choice isn't always that important
[23:08:26] <galambo> I think robinhood is sinister. I think they make some money by abusing the ask/buy spread
[23:08:27] <gwern> shawwwn: yes, mostly. it's the basic FC vs CNN thing. there's no translational invariance, so if a cat ear is even 1 pixel out of place, then in the naive FC NxN parameterization, that's a *completely* different set of weights applied to the new ear-pixel
[23:08:44] <shawwwn> Aha
[23:08:49] <galambo> maybe not robinhood
[23:08:55] <galambo> but similar platforms in the uk do this

[23:12:09] <galambo> linear, this is actually my issue with leveraged investments. the upside is high, but the downside is brutal.
[23:12:30] <linear> (e.g. covid crash was around -75% in a month or so, few people can handle that much of a psychological/financial downturn so quickly. But since that bottom it is up almost 700% in another year -.-
[23:13:21] <linear> I advise not looking at them too much because they will mess with your head the same way constantly fantsaizing about buying into the eth pre-sale or mining btc in the first year does

[23:15:19] <linear> yeah, it's hard to judge a 'risk of ruin', I can imagine some really bad things happening to semiconductors, but bad enough to cause them to crash and not recover for 5-10+ years seems unlikely. But definitely possible! Anyone more responsible would diversify either way 
[23:15:34] <galambo> linear, this is a quote from lifecycle investing: 7 Taleb has suggested that people should invest 85 percent of their investments in super-safe government bonds and reserve just 15 percent of their portfolio for riskier stock plays. He reasons that, no matter what you do, you can't lose more than 15 percent of your investment. Somewhat surprisingly, there is a way to follow both his advice and most of ours, too. With derivatives such as futures and 
[23:15:34] <galambo> options on stock indexes, it is possible to expose twelve times your investment in the market. Following Taleb, you could invest 85 percent of your portfolio in government bonds, leverage the remaining 15 percent at 12:1, and come close to producing an Overall portfolio that implements our 2:1 advice. The problem with this approach is that investing with 12:1 leverage for several years imposes too great a risk of margin calls (or a risk that your 
[23:15:34] <galambo> options will expire out of the money and be worthless). In other words, it's too great a risk that you will just end up with 85 percent of your portfolio.
[23:16:40] <linear> I will certainly not touch something as boring as government bonds myself, but others that enjoy boring lifestyles are free to!

[23:20:04] <catern> on the topic of investing in AI, I told someone about (the idea of) the singularity like 5 years ago, and they went out and bought 20k of semiconductor stock, which has handily done 2x S&P over the last 5 years
[23:20:46] <catern> they bought it because they found the idea plausible and if computers are taking over then semiconductors will be important
[23:20:56] <catern> I'm not sure what lesson I'm supposed to take from this...
[23:21:43] <pompolic> my take: "decomposing things is fun and profitable"
[23:21:44] <gwern> buying government bonds isn't boring. you can watch fascinated each year to see how much you'll lose in real value and in opportunity cost - will it be 20% like 2020, or merely 3%?! tune in for the latest exciting twist
[23:22:02] <linear> have done little research in it but would be nice to see what one could invest in that comes either alongside, or before semiconductors, in the manufacturing pipeline, which has more potential room for growth, since chip fabs can only be built so quickly ofc
[23:22:30] <linear> gwern: that's true, but i'd rather feel a burst of positive emotion/dopamine at least every here and there, rather than nothing but regret

[23:31:30] <pompolic> it was held by two people
[23:31:43] <pompolic> one of them explained something, the other mocked it
[23:32:13] <pompolic> i don't remember it well but i remember they had a cogent critique of hydrogen fuel cells
[23:33:03] <ggreer> hydrogen is really flammable. it's an invisible gas that has no smell. also you can't add smelly things to the gas because that will clog the fuel cell
[23:33:07] <pompolic> ...i think my university was full of shitposters
[23:33:10] <ggreer> the flame is almost invisible too

[23:34:25] <gwern> ...contact with caretakers, as long as the interaction was not “forced.” The consequences can be “very positive, especially when the sexual relationship can be characterized as mutual love,” he wrote.'
[23:34:28] <pompolic> ah, makes sense
[23:35:52] <ggreer> and you have to use energy to compress the hydrogen. best case, solar -> H2O -> H2 -> fuel cell -> electric motor is about 40% as efficient. solar -> battery -> electric motor is about 80% efficient

[23:42:11] <ggreer> batteries aren't that energy dense, but they're dense enough for cars. transporting electricity is super easy
[23:42:38] <Logos01> ggreer: Honestly I think structural batteries being adopted in vehicles will be the definitive element in that conversation.
[23:43:03] <Logos01> Also, transporting electricty may be easy but we actually can't do enough of it to make ubiquitous "green" energy viable in the US at least.
[23:43:20] <Logos01> Because eco-activists block the development of the necessary additional power corridors to do so.

[23:46:23] <gwern> uncertainty is in the map, not the territory
[23:46:44] <Logos01> I don't know that anyone aside from motivated reasoners ever thought hydrogen would be a meaningful part of the fuel energy economy of the world.
[23:47:39] <shawwwn> uncertainty is the map reduce
[23:48:05] <Logos01> The closest I could ever see to it would be the very thing I just described above. The use of electrolysis to obtain the hydrogen necessary to make Fischer-Tropsch processes not output co2.

[23:50:24] <shawwwn> so much for freenode https://netsplit.de/networks/top10.php
[23:51:12] <gwern> turns out deleting your entire userbase is not great for growth
[23:51:29] <gwern> I'm shocked it's only... halved? who are these people on 'freenode'?
[23:52:07] <gwern> hm, channels/servers are halved; 'users' is more like thirded
[23:52:45] <gwern> still, surprisingly high. who are these people who make up a third of the original freenode userbase, read 'hey, we deleted your account for no reason' , and though 'yeah, that happens, guess I'll make a new one'
[23:54:01] <galambo> so freenode is now a post thanos community
[23:54:45] <gwern> 'but for the clown price, it was tuesday'
[23:56:07] <gwern> 'I meet this guy named Marcus Elliot...he does this thing called misogi, and how it's a--he took the term from an ancient Japanese tale. And, the idea is that once a year he gets a group of people and they do one really hard, sort of cooky, task. So, for example, one year him and his friends, they got an 85-pound bolder and they walked it five miles underneath the Santa Barbara Channel. So,...
[23:56:13] <gwern> ...one would dive down, carry this thing for 10 yards, dive back up; the next guy would go. They did one year where they stand-up paddleboarded 25 miles across the channel. And, they'd never really stand up paddleboarded before, right? So, there's two rules to misogi. Rule Number One is that it has to be really hard. And, he defines this by saying you should have a true 50% chance of...
[23:56:19] <gwern> ...finishing this thing. And, Number Two is that you can't die.' https://www.econtalk.org/michael-easter-on-the-comfort-crisis/
