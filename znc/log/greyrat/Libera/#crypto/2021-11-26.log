[00:40:16] <Hash> Good morning! :)
[00:47:27] <testusr> Hi :) 
[00:47:48] <Hash> Studying Integral Cryptanalysis basics today
[00:47:59] <Hash> Particularly useful against block ciphers
[00:48:10] <Hash> Differential analysis looks at pairs of inputs that differ in only one bit position, with all other bits identical
[00:48:17] *** Quits: qbt (~qbt@user/edun) (Quit: Leaving.)
[00:48:32] <Hash> Integral analysis, for block size b, holds b-k bits constant and runs the other k through all 2k possibilities
[00:48:41] <Hash> For k=1, this is just differential cryptanalysis, but with k>1 it is a new technique
[00:51:16] <testusr> Are you an "indie-researcher"? 
[00:51:29] <Hash> No
[00:51:42] <Hash> Fulltime college student, doing accelerated bachelors degree.
[00:51:51] <Hash> 1 year so far, 50% bachelor degree doen.
[00:52:08] <Hash> All the boring courses done, and now this year, for next 12 months all security stuff to study. Fun
[00:52:15] <testusr> Oh I wasn't aware of accelerated bachelors programs :) cool. 
[00:52:20] <Hash> Wtih a couple of boring classes still like leal issues and ethics and stuff
[00:52:40] <Hash> Yeah, I had a full scholarship and grants and stuff, since I am a good student 
[00:52:54] <Hash> Last GPA at last college in my last degree was 3.6 cumulative 
[00:53:05] <Hash> Very high. Semester last GPA was 3.8
[00:53:14] <Hash> Out of 4.0
[00:53:21] <Hash> That's considered super good
[00:53:28] <testusr> So this isn't your first degree 
[00:53:31] <Hash> No
[00:53:43] <Hash> Second one. First was computer science 18 years ago
[00:53:52] <Hash> Then I did networking, software dev, some security
[00:54:05] <Hash> Now a mid life career change.
[00:54:59] <Hash> What about you, brother
[00:55:07] <Hash> What kind of security/cryptography stuff do you get into?
[00:55:16] <testusr> Oh, I really love mid life career changes :) 
[00:55:20] <Hash> Do you do this for work/professionally? Or you a teacher?
[00:55:48] <testusr> Actually, more of a hobby :) 
[00:56:23] <Hash> Oh cool hobby
[00:57:58] <testusr> I'm finishing my first BSc in CS, even if I didn't really put a lot of effort in it. Not much of an academic type , even if I'm going through changes either :) 
[00:58:09] <Hash> Oh ok
[00:58:16] <Hash> I am a student nerd. I study too much lol
[00:58:41] <testusr> more of a B guy :P Not top of the class. 
[00:59:00] <Hash> I have not gotten a single B yet in any of my classes yet.
[00:59:08] <Hash> All A's so far, 95%+
[00:59:27] <Hash> Not that it matters.
[00:59:48] <Hash> I have some mental problems like severe OCD
[00:59:59] <Hash> I can't even have a singel grain of rice outside my rice pile on plate.
[01:00:11] <Hash> Likewise, I can't stand a single imperfection in my study or my work.
[01:00:28] <Hash> If I even get one question wrong on my exam, I feel bad. It's a stupid mental thing I have to constantly fight.
[01:00:38] <testusr> Very good :) I took A / A+ only in the latest tests, that I found more interesting. I really noticed how much commitments really makes the difference. 
[01:00:40] <Hash> I do myself a disservice sometime by being too meticulous

[01:01:02] <Hash> Sometimes I spend time reading things that I don't even need to for class, but I do anyway becuse it's interesting.
[01:01:13] <Hash> If I only did the school stuff instead of learning everything, I'd be much faster.
[01:01:49] <tusko> Man, my grade in cryptography was so low
[01:01:50] <testusr> Yeah, I do more of that stuff I should do for my classes. More papers than textbooks 
[01:01:59] <tusko> I think I got a 50 on the first test
[01:02:06] <testusr> more of that, than * 
[01:02:21] <tusko> did slightly better with a 58 on the second test... almost passed.
[01:02:40] <tusko> grades don't matter though. I know that for sure now.
[01:02:49] <Hash> Not realy
[01:02:54] <Hash> Employers don't know or care about grades.
[01:03:00] <Hash> Just my only mind does
[01:03:03] <Hash> Stupid brain!

[23:34:01] <dostoyevsky2> iz: Sounds interesting.  The applications may vary, but e.g.: I have a vault that generates secrets for other microservices to use, and I want to store these secrets securely... so I could mount the LUKS embedded file system with a passwort -> Secure Static Password generated via yubikey (requiring a fingerprint, or nfc based confirmation) and then be able to restart the vault with all the secrets it 
[23:34:07] <dostoyevsky2> only had in memory before (e.g. before crashing)
[23:35:04] <dostoyevsky2> Renewal of secrets or adding new secrets would also require approval via yubikey
[23:40:09] <dostoyevsky2> (So the LUKS would only be mounted for a short time, and then be unmounted again)
