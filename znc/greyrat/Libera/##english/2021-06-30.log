[08:29:45] <soulisson> Hi
[08:30:37] <pussipupu> Well, there's “guarding against”
[08:31:27] <pussipupu> I'm sure I've heard “en gard” used as a verb, but that's probably not a good look
[08:32:05] <soulisson> pussipupu, isn't "en gard" from the french "en garde"?
[08:32:36] <pussipupu> Yes, and I missed the “e” because I can't type :þ
[08:32:50] <pussipupu> (or because this keyboard is terrible, or some mixture of these)
[08:33:04] <soulisson> ok, no problem :)

[08:33:45] * LjL keeps pussipupu at bay with a fencing-grade sword
[08:35:53] * pussipupu draws an actual sword-grade sword
[08:35:54] <soulisson> Apologies for this question. I'm struggling with what is called "reported speech". I wrote some sentences here: https://pastebin.com/pdUjH8xp I wanted to kow if those are reported speeches and my second question "Does the part between [] indicate the reported speech or the action requested?"
[08:36:02] <pussipupu> Not that I'd know how to use one especilly
[08:38:11] <pussipupu> Yes, though on the face of it “reported speech” is an odd term for indirect quotation
[08:39:34] <pussipupu> I think the “that” doesn't really belong to the reported speech though, and I'm not sure the “to” does
[08:42:25] <soulisson> pussipupu, ok, so theses sentences are reported speeches. I thought that the part between [] for the sentences B, C, D, E would be considered as an indication of an action, not of the speech itself. Because for instance, for sentence B. What did he ask? => To wash the dishes.
[08:43:15] <soulisson> but I'm dumb. I'm struggling with simple things.

[14:32:42] <GuiToris> hello, is it 'cellphone' or 'cell phone'?
[14:34:15] <snappy> i think cellphone is just a portmanteau of cellular phone
[14:35:20] <anrom> !w cell phone
[14:35:22] <tinsoldier> cell phone — Noun: 1. A portable, wireless telephone, which changes antenna connections seamlessly during travel from one radio reception cell to another without losing the party-to-party call connection. https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cell_phone
[14:35:33] <anrom> !w mobile
[14:35:35] <tinsoldier> mobile — Noun: 1.  (art) A kinetic sculpture or decorative arrangement made of items hanging so that they can move independently from each other. (telephony, Britain) Ellipsis of mobile phone, 2. (uncountable, Internet) The internet accessed via mobile devices., 3. Something that can move., — Adjective: 1. Capable of being moved, especially on wheel <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mobile>...
[14:35:53] <GuiToris> !w cellphone
[14:35:56] <tinsoldier> cellphone — Noun: 1. Alternative form of cell phone, — Verb: 1. To make a call on a cellphone. https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cellphone
[14:36:19] <GuiToris> I guess if it's alternative then less frequently used
[14:36:36] <MetaNova> GuiToris: cellphone
[14:37:03] <GuiToris> so it's not, thank you
[14:37:59] <MetaNova> and snappy is correct, it's short for cellular telephone
[14:38:27] <MetaNova> mobile is more common in other regions
[14:38:34] <MetaNova> it's solidly cellphone in AmE

[14:44:55] <blkshp> I thought the whole world just said "phone" now (though the accuracy of that name is limited)
[14:45:34] <anrom> Can you call it a miniature portable computer that you can also make calls on?
[14:45:47] <blkshp> That would be my preference.
[14:45:51] <MetaNova> well, that's what mobile implies
[14:46:03] * blkshp likes "Hand terminal" from The Expanse books.
[14:46:03] <MetaNova> "mobile telephone" and/or "mobile computing device"
[14:46:25] <TechTest> why do they make phones that big?
[14:46:50] <TechTest> get a phone or get a computer, not an in between useless thing 
[14:46:53] <blkshp> Hand terminals can be big for people with big hands like me.

[14:56:30] <TechTest> I can now officially say whatever I want

[17:09:19] <furrykef> Then of course there are drivers...
[17:10:35] <pussipupu> oh right, I wouldn't count software being targeted at an OS as a feature of that OS personally but I'm sure
[17:10:50] <pussipupu> Drivers can be an issue in both directions
[17:11:14] <huf> eh, it kinda is a feature of the OS that given a randomly chosen bit of software, you can probably run it
[17:11:28] <huf> not an inherent technical feature, mind you
[17:11:34] <TechTest> pussipupu: how hot is it there?
[17:11:39] <huf> it's more of a historical thing
[17:12:25] <anrom> Too hot.
[17:12:38] <huf> it's actually p nice here now
[17:12:41] <huf> only 30C or so

[17:14:15] <pussipupu> More of the software I want to use runs properly on Linux distros than on Windows to be honest, one man's meat and all that
[17:14:20] <pussipupu> And the OS itself I find Windows to be absurdly feature poor
[17:15:51] <huf> i like it

[17:18:46] <huf> isnt it hot as balls in the frozen north too?
[17:19:03] <huf> it was nearly 40C in edmonton ffs
[17:19:37] <TechTest> here (Greece) it was 40C two days ago

[17:34:52] <m1dnight> Hi all. I'm trying to figure out if I'm correct, but don't know how to google it. The sentence I have is "Ever lenient professor foo did something". 
[17:35:04] <m1dnight> I'm wondering if it's "Ever-lenient" or "Ever lenient".
[17:35:13] <m1dnight> I'm looking for "ever- propositions" or something, right?
[17:35:56] <m1dnight> Ah, it's adjective. Sorry.

[20:22:12] <||JD||> When you refer to something that belongs to something else, do you always use the 's possessive? Are there exceptions?
[20:23:11] <TimMc> ||JD||: There are ways to avoid that construction, but generally you'd use "'s", yes.
[20:23:12] <raccoon_dog> Not always. You can sometimes use "of" -- "John is a friend of mine."
[20:23:18] <TimMc> ^
[20:23:19] <raccoon_dog> Or something like "John is my friend."
[20:23:37] <TimMc> Oh yeah, those are both common.
[20:23:50] <TimMc> And 's doesn't always mean possession, despite the name.
[20:24:03] <raccoon_dog> Well, that's why I prefer to call it the "Saxon genitive."
[20:24:09] <raccoon_dog> That's what it is.
[20:24:10] <TimMc> It means some kind of relationship. My boss, my wife, my planet, etc.

[20:27:38] <raccoon_dog> And there are cases where both the Saxon genitive construction and a more mundane construction with "of" make sense: "The system's failure" and "The failure of the system".
[20:28:18] <||JD||> Ok, let me try to ask a better question, what I would really want to know if you use the 's regardless if you are talking about persons or any kind of object
[20:28:56] <TimMc> ||JD||: Sure, it's used for both people and inanimate objects.
[20:28:58] <LuisM14> no restriction of entity
[20:29:06] <raccoon_dog> It can be used for both.
[20:29:15] <TimMc> It doesn't mean ownership.
