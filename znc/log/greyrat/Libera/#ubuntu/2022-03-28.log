[00:09:29] <ubottu> Sven_vB: End-Of-Life is when security updates and support for an Ubuntu release stop. Make sure to update Ubuntu before it goes EOL so you get updates promptly for newly-discovered security vulnerabilities. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EOL and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases for more info. Looking to upgrade from an EOL release? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EOLUpgrades
[00:10:03] <Sven_vB> oh, so that one is End-of-Life even though it's newer than the default lowlatency kernel?

[06:00:22] <Gallomimia> nah i might start using this more often
[06:00:23] <blahboybaz> good luck
[06:00:29] <Gallomimia> ah, i do recall being there
[06:00:53] <Gallomimia> then someone in this channel said i should play with raid and cryptfs and LVM and that seemed neat, but when things broke, i really really had to learn a lot to fix it

[06:01:32] <blahboybaz> I built a gentoo system once - raid 5 on a tower I built that had 9tb (3, 3tb drives)
[06:01:38] <blahboybaz> that was a long time ago
[06:01:44] <Gallomimia> yes i miss my raid5
[06:02:00] <Gallomimia> but i dropped it on my face and killed one drive, while severely damaging the other 2
[06:02:16] <blahboybaz> that sucks
[06:02:19] <Gallomimia> they ran for awhile but i eventually figured out that they're chugging because of the damage.
[06:02:24] <blahboybaz> someone ripped me off for mine
[06:02:26] <Gallomimia> the data is still recoverable i just have to do it
[06:02:33] <Gallomimia> oh man.... i'm sorry to hear that

[06:04:25] <Gallomimia> cheers. i got no luck with this but a few things of insight
[06:05:09] <Gallomimia> oops if you can hook up a second monitor, it should be configurable under "Display Settings"

[12:34:51] <Dr-007> what does boot-repair do under the hood? because in the livecd ive made a script to simply copy the rootfs from the cd/usb back to my hdd then run boot-repair to add the newly copied ubuntu to grub.
[12:35:06] <Dr-007> in other words, how would i do the os-prober myself?

[18:48:39] <Dr-007> hey guys. question. ive made a livecd from my installed ubuntu. then i made a script to copy back the livecd to an empty partition, update the fstab to match the uuid of that partition and update grub on the partition grub is running on according to the EFI partition ... the copied OS shows up in grub when i boot. when i select it ubuntu boots. but when i check `mount` i see that the wrong ubuntu partition has been loaded. i verified the grub.cfg and the
[18:48:39] <Dr-007> UUID is pointing towards the new partition. what could i be forgetting? should i regenerate the initrd or something?

[19:59:21] <signofzeta> I'm having an odd performance issue with my system.  I sometimes encode videos. If I don't overclock, it runs at about 3 fps and my fans/temps stay low.  If I overclock even 25 MHz, it jumps up to 16 fps and the fans/temps shoot up.  Is this an Ubuntu thing (21.10), or something with my BIOS?  I did run cpufreq-info and `cat /proc/cpuinfo` and it always says my processor is running at full speed.

[21:08:49] <en11gma> i was making a persistent drive in ubuntu 20.04.4 amd64 last night and got it to work on my usb 16GB stick. gpt/fat32/11GB persistent. problem is that it is super slow when running. is there a way i can attach an external hdd formatted gpt/fat32 and make that whole drive the persistent partition and make the usb 16GB stick with no partitions?

[21:10:11] <Dr-007> i dont know the answers to yours questions per se. buuut... at first i just cloned all files to an usb thumbdrive then installed grub onto an EFI partition and it booted

[21:22:07] <Dr-007> basicly. if you got 1 EFI partition with windows's bootmgr and GRUB. they move they replace window's bootmgr with GRUB. but this will make it so that you cant boot into windows. so then you need that second EFI partition

[21:27:38] <en11gma> unless there is a good guide someone can put up. somehow either when the ubuntu boot manager loads up (super grub) or the win boot manager loads up it will overwrite one or the other. always this constant stugle since the beginning

[21:44:51] *** Quits: p0indexter (~alpha@user/p0indexter) (Quit: ars longa vita brevis)
[21:45:48] <Dr-007> question: ive extracted a copy ubuntu to another partition on my hdd. from what ive got running. i updated /etc/stab and grub. in grub the new partition is showing up. it boots. but when i enter the ubuntu OS, in terminal `mount | grep sd` gives me not the partition i copied the rootfs into. it gives me the partition i copied it from in the first place. so i thought.. it should be my /etc/fstab but thats certainly o.k. then i thought maybe i just need to
[21:45:48] <Dr-007> update/recreate my initramfs in this new partition (so i created a new one once i was chrooted into it) ... but no luck. any suggestions?

[22:34:24] <ogra> *and
[22:34:43] <Dr-007> yes. but i gave you a paste earlier
[22:34:52] <Dr-007> in the upper part it is right

[22:35:32] <Dr-007> so im baffled by that
[22:36:04] <Dr-007> it might be because ive got an exact clone of ubuntu running on partition sda5 and sda8

[23:41:14] <t2> hello folks
[23:41:41] <t2> I'm trying to install CTParental, but it only has .deb packages for ubuntu 20.04 and 21.10
[23:41:47] <t2> and I have 21.04

[23:42:09] <ubottu> t2: End-Of-Life is when security updates and support for an Ubuntu release stop. Make sure to update Ubuntu before it goes EOL so you get updates promptly for newly-discovered security vulnerabilities. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EOL and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases for more info. Looking to upgrade from an EOL release? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EOLUpgrades
[23:42:09] <t2> do u think it's worth trying to install the 21.10 package? what's the worst that could happen
[23:42:38] <t2> thanks ravage, I had no idea it was eol already. will upgrade :)
