[21:14:30] <ehuelsmann[m]> NeatNit: you don't have all the prereqs installed search APT for libcrypt-pk-ecc-perl
[21:14:36] <ehuelsmann[m]> (I don't think it's there, btw)
[21:14:43] <NeatNit> it's not, tried that :/
[21:17:16] <ehuelsmann[m]> ok. then you'll have to install it from CPAN.
[21:17:43] <NeatNit> what's the command for that?
[21:17:51] <ehuelsmann[m]> you can do that by installing from apt cpanminus: `apt install cpanminus`
[21:18:04] <NeatNit> I think cpan is already installed
[21:18:07] <ehuelsmann[m]> and then installing the missing dependency from cpan using
[21:18:36] <NeatNit> in fact, I know it, but I stupidly messed up the initial configuration for cpan..
[21:18:44] <ehuelsmann[m]> ok. I think cpanminus has a more user friendly interface though.
[21:18:53] <NeatNit> (it asked me whether to append something to .bashrc and I said no because I'm dumb)
[21:18:57] <NeatNit> not sure how important that is
[21:19:05] <NeatNit> oh, alright then
[21:19:17] <ehuelsmann[m]> running `cpanm --notest Crypt::PK::ECC` should get you the right dependency when you have cpanminus installed.
[21:20:28] <NeatNit> thanks! installing cpanminus right now
