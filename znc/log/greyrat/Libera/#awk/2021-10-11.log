[19:23:21] <wwilliam> https://paste.debian.net/1215068/
[19:28:11] <emanuele6> wwilliam: 'EOF'
[19:28:44] <emanuele6> you need to quote the first EOF otherwise $4 and $5 will be expanded by the shell
[19:28:47] <yitz> Because $4 is being expanded locally
[19:28:56] <wwilliam> Thank you all
[19:29:53] <wwilliam> worked.
[19:33:01] <Patsie> instead of: cmd | head | awk '{ print $4, $5 }', you can also use: cmd | awk '(NR < 10) { print $4, $5 }'
[19:35:22] <emanuele6> works also without parentheses
[19:36:01] <yitz> If we're getting nit picky, NR <= 10

[20:01:56] <nmz> you gotta exit or awk will read the entire file/pipe.
[20:04:03] <yitz> Which can be good or bad. Closing the pipe can make some programs sad.

[21:52:41] <podeni> Hello, here's my question: how do I replace a string in a specific variable? Say I want to sub things only in $2, is there a way to do this?
[21:55:46] <podeni> Silly me, I see the third parameter of sub works for both input and output. I thought it's only for output for some reason.
[22:07:08] <nmz> output?
[22:08:28] <nmz> podeni: the third parameter of sub is a variable, by default its $0, it returns true if it changed something
[22:08:40] <nmz> so you can use it as an expression in a pattern
[22:09:02] <nmz> yitz: how do you exit securely?
[22:09:18] <nmz> I imagine head exits after the 10th line no?
[22:10:04] <yitz> There's no "secure" vs "insecure" here. It's just a question of whether the pipe is being closed or not
[22:10:12] <yitz> Different options/behaviors
[22:10:54] <yitz> If you run scripts with   set -eo pipefail   (which isn't advised but still something a lot of people do), closing a pipe can bite you in unexpected ways
[22:11:12] <yitz> If you don't use both of those, closing the pipe can save resources
[22:45:13] <Patsie> anybody have a better suggestion to test for 1 through 5 digits of numbers 1 through 6 than this -> case /^[1-6][1-6]?[1-6]?[1-6]?[1-6]?$/:
[22:45:31] <yitz> {n,m} ?
[22:45:40] <nmz> not portable
[22:45:42] <yitz> I'm not sure if awk supports thatr
[22:45:49] <nmz> gawk does I think
[22:45:54] <yitz>  Do you need a portable solution? :D
[22:46:04] <Patsie> no, using gawk all over
[22:46:21] <nmz> # echo 5673483 | awk '/[0-9]{1,2]}/'
[22:46:21] <yitz> ^[1-6]{1,5}$/
[22:46:28] <shbot> nmz: awk: illegal repetition expression: class [0-9]{1,2]}
[22:46:29] <shbot> nmz:  source line number 1
[22:46:29] <shbot> nmz: etc... ( http://ix.io/3Btn )
[22:46:42] <nmz> woops
[22:47:28] <Patsie> works, nicely, thanks
[22:47:30] <Patsie> case /^[1-6]{1,5}$/:
[23:08:30] <yitz> awk has a case statement? TIL
[23:08:43] <nmz> only on switch
[23:09:06] <nmz> which is only on gawk
[23:11:10] <yitz> I'm with Patsie on being fine with relying on gawk :D
[23:14:15] <Patsie> yes, switch/case is gawk only. I'm also using namespaces, so yes, this is a gawk-only application
[23:14:23] <Patsie> and includes
[23:14:47] <Patsie> and now even {1,5}
[23:18:01] <yitz> I'm familiar with includes and {n,m} but I don't think I've seen namespaces
[23:19:48] <yitz> Hrm. Looks interesting ... and like C++ and like something I'd never use as my scripts aren't nearly large enough
[23:22:06] <Patsie> it's not real OOP, but it's something
