[11:27:53] <dch> there are a few small build issues in rc.0- so we will have a little while before the official release
[11:28:09] <rawtaz> eh, i thought 3.2 wasnt released yet, that its only in rc
[11:28:30] <rawtaz> but is the rest of couchdb still erlang or is that part too migrating to elixir?

[11:31:38] <rawtaz> i mean, it gives a whole new level of serious impression. while almost every other software/project dont have memes in their "changelogs", they give the impression of trying to be all serious business. while here couchdb just sidesteps all of that political stancetaking and conveys their messages in a way that actually matter.

[12:45:54] <serafeim> or it has been replaced with something else ?
[12:46:15] <serafeim> the chris mccord instructions don't mention this at all
[12:47:03] <Nicd> probably it's your own addition
[12:47:26] <Nicd> do you have phoenix_ecto installed?
[12:47:46] <serafeim> hmmm yes it seems that i had removed it completely!
[12:48:22] <serafeim> uh oh. now i'm getting  this: `    ** (UndefinedFunctionError) function :crypto.hmac/3 is undefined or private`
[12:49:22] <Nicd> that's another OTP 24 problem
[12:49:36] <Nicd> you can find it on the forum but most likely you need postgrex at least version 0.15.8

[20:56:17] <Ankhers> I think the idea is that esbuild is "simpler" to use. But if you want you can still choose webpack, brunch or whatever packaging system you want.
[20:56:43] <hoppity`> I am on Phoenix 1.5.9 so am kind of stuck for a while :(
[20:57:00] <Ankhers> Stuck with what?
[20:57:09] <hoppity`> With Phoenix 1.5.9
[20:57:18] <phaleth> hoppity`: what exactly you mean?
[20:57:30] <Ankhers> I mean, you could migrate to 1.6. But I'm not sure what you mean stuck.
[20:57:44] <hoppity`> I mean I can't easily move from Phoenix 1.5.9 to Phoenix 1.6.0

[21:03:57] <Ankhers> You may need to update all of the dependencies listed in the guide, not just phoenix.
[21:04:58] <phaleth> yeah, prolly
[21:05:22] <phaleth> that guide looks dated already, let me see what I have in mix.exs

[21:34:29] <hoppity`> I will reserach removing webpack before I take any more of your time
[21:34:34] <Ankhers> You don't have to take out webpack. That is an optional step that may not make sense for your project.
[21:35:04] <hoppity`> Ankhers: I am using TailwindCSS, so I am not sure if I can remove webpack
[21:35:14] <hoppity`> keep in mind I am new to bundlers and things of the  sort
[21:35:21] <Ankhers> You can. I have a project setup that just uses esbuild with tailwind.
[21:35:47] <hoppity`> Should I look into the details of esbuild then?
[21:35:53] <phaleth> there is a vid on youtube about removing webpack and moving the assets to the correct dir for esbuild, not sure it contains the tailwind + esbuild setup but that's not too difficult to do
[21:35:58] <Ankhers> https://sergiotapia.com/phoenix-160-liveview-esbuild-tailwind-jit-alpinejs-a-brief-tutorial -- This may be helpful. But don't remove webpack just for the sake of removing it. If you are happy with it, just leave it.
[21:36:35] <hoppity`> Thanks for the video, I am neither happy or sad with webpack, just use it because that's what Phoenix tutorials used to use, and I wanted to learn Phoenix :p
[21:36:51] <Ankhers> I personally don't like touching things like webpack. So I probably won't remove webpack from certain projects. Or just get others to deal with it.
[21:36:54] <hoppity`> In my mind, I still want to go back to the old days of including libraries with html tags haha
[21:37:15] <Ankhers> There is nothing stopping you from doing something like that. Just include it from a CDN.
[21:37:48] <Ankhers> I'm not sure how well something like tailwind would work though because it is huge from my understanding.
[21:38:10] <hoppity`> true, the only benefit I see (I know there are others) from using npm/webpack is the ocassional security warning that I receive, which npm audit fix never fixes any way
[21:40:00] <phaleth> hoppity`: that's cause you have webpack version 4
[21:40:37] <hoppity`> phaleth: what is "that"?
[21:40:43] <hoppity`> what do u mean
[21:40:56] <phaleth> I could explain how to upgrade to webpack 5, including tailwind, but that might be more difficult to do than replacing webpack with esbuild
[21:41:07] <hoppity`> no doubt
[21:41:09] <phaleth> heh, well, I mean webpack 4 is old
[21:41:30] <phaleth> that's what gives you those security warnings
