[00:14:57] <louipc00D> origins of big band is a bit older than rockabilly and comes out of jazz
[00:15:36] <murthy> at0m: Panther is the person for classic rock and classic jazz
[00:15:38] <louipc00D> and i guess can just be straight jazz/blues at times

[00:30:44] <murthy> at0m: but I understand the autonomy of the band
[00:30:53] <louipc00D> depends on the relationships
[00:31:01] <at0m> murthy: depends. i don't want to be that kind of producer. i merely try to rec them as good as possible, then make all the stuff they want glue together properly
[00:31:05] <louipc00D> sometimes producer hires the musicians
[00:31:15] <louipc00D> instead of the musicians hiring the producer
[00:31:41] <murthy> louipc00D: Thats exactly how bollywood works
[00:32:16] <murthy> at0m: I understand
[00:33:08] <at0m> murthy: ofc i did give them some hints, and managed them during the recording days. for example when the guitarist came to me "you can fix this in post, right?" i went "nope. won't do. you fix your guitar sound right now."
[00:33:49] <at0m> murthy: apparently of the 2 amps he brought, both had a bulb worn. swapped them out, and yay we good a great amp to work with

[00:54:09] <murthy> Panther: checkout the spices used by singers
[00:54:18] <Panther> It needs lots of work. The hardest thing is to stay exactly on a pitch, and not even move 1Hz.
[00:54:26] <at0m> louipc00D: ie. the fader doesn't directly control the volume, it sends a voltage to a unit that does the actual levels/controls/..
[00:54:52] <murthy> Panther: tough
[00:54:59] <murthy> at0m: but you can do it
[00:55:07] <louipc00D> do vibrato or something

[01:29:31] <murthy> at0m: Finished!
[01:29:52] <at0m> yay! you survived my playlist \o/
[01:29:55] <murthy> at0m: You music album was very nice. I enjoyed a lot listening to it. Thanks for sharing!
[01:30:24] <murthy> Panther: I recommend listening to at0m's music whenever you find free time
[01:30:42] <murthy> at0m: I have an opinion, may I share it?
[01:31:56] <at0m> murthy: yes, that's why i sent it
[01:35:38] <murthy> at0m: I am male but a feminist. Afaik the 70's jazz and other most genres were male dominated, I just discovered the rockabilly genre today only, but just from listening the samples, I feel most of them were sung by males. So if you ask me, someone listening to 70's music would expect a male singer, plus the current male singer's voice is good. Having said that, its good to try a female voice on it. I wish the female singer's version comes good!. Its just 
[01:35:38] <murthy> that I value art and music a lot even more than feminism.
[01:39:13] <murthy> at0m: can I bookmark the link you sent me and listen to it from time to time until you later publish the final one?

[02:12:29] <Janet> louipc00D thinks murthy meant to say: Why is the Prague people keep disappearing on corn?
[02:16:01] <Panther> Which Prague ppl?
[02:16:23] <Panther> You do know they sometimes like to defenestrate each other there. :-/
[02:17:30] <at0m> that was back in 1618 :D https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenestration
[02:17:30] <Janet> ^ Defenestration is the act of throwing someone or something out of a window. The term was coined around the time of an incident in Prague Castle in the year 1618 which became the spark that started the Thirty Years' War.

[02:18:47] <Panther> 30 yrs war was very brutal.
[02:19:03] <louipc00D> sounds fun
[02:19:05] <Panther> It is likely the cause of the ongoing fragmentation of most of Germany for so long.
[02:19:28] <murthy> Panther: Do you know any other Prague people here? There is only one here
[02:20:04] <louipc00D> the world started as many tribes, many kingdoms and city states
[02:20:09] <at0m> louipc00D: we've had 80yrs war, 100yrs war. luckily, those, too, are long ago
[02:20:33] <louipc00D> i belive it will move back that way as humans regain their consciousness
[02:20:49] <murthy> macrobat: Is it ok if I use the word kurva?
[02:21:05] <louipc00D> and break free from tyranical and oppresive central control
[02:21:23] <at0m> louipc00D: yea, like they did in Lybia [/sarcasm]
[02:21:46] <Panther> Ah ha!
[02:22:01] <louipc00D> you know that was an imperial orchestrated coup
[02:22:03] <Panther> That is what I thought last night.... wxactly...
[02:22:15] <Panther> This World is a new Tower of Babel :)

[15:18:44] <Inhahe> ohh ou
[15:18:45] <Inhahe> ok
[15:18:55] <Inhahe> sometimes the differences are subtle because there are so many subgenres, i guess.
[15:18:58] <louipc00D> house, dnb, new wave, dont know wtf any of it is
[15:19:36] <louipc00D> i thought new wave was poprock blondie, talking heads, watev
[15:19:36] <Inhahe> i knew of a cool site that listed all the subgenres in groups or categories or whatever and you could listen to samples for each one, it was cool. i don't know the url now though.
