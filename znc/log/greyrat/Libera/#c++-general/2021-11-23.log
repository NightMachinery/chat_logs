[01:02:48] <PJBoy> compile time string building is harder than it should be
[01:03:36] <PJBoy> what's the goal with this?
[01:06:09] <MaddHatter> to eliminate name conflicts between C++ variables and functions, and the same names used by the preprocessor, mostly
[01:07:49] <PJBoy> ah ok you can't possibly create new identifiers without macros
[01:08:00] <PJBoy> I thought we were doing string literals
[01:10:57] <MaddHatter> the string literals is why it can't just be an ordinary function in the first place
[01:12:03] <MaddHatter> foo(x) is a #define that takes (I'm pretty sure always) a string literal, and does some token-pasting with it. What it's doing is only relevant because that's why it has to be a #define instead of a function.
[01:13:28] <MaddHatter> if I could make it something the compiler understands (rather than the preprocessor), then warnings and errors would issue when there are conflicts and shadowing.

[09:34:12] <fluter> hi, i'm making a network client app, it needs to keep a queue of requests to the server, each request must be sent on a new connection, like connect->send->recv->disconnect,
[09:34:28] <fluter> how can i best make this work in good design? i'm not using boost asio

[09:39:18] <RandomReader> that doesn't really describe enough, what kind of protocol is this and why does there need to be a queue?
[09:39:39] <RandomReader> and what are you using for a network api?
[09:40:55] <fluter> it's tcp based protocol, requests and responses are structs, because the client app get user input and input is keeps coming even there is a request ongoing, so i keep a queue
[09:41:12] <fluter> i'm using a basic eventloop reactor style api
[09:42:42] <RandomReader> I'm not sure I understand the question then, it sounds like you've already chosen a design?
[09:43:39] <fluter> not yet, the eventloop is very basic, like register a fd for read/write that's it, a wrapper around epoll
[09:43:52] <johnny> didn't folks use something like libuv for this? hmm
[09:43:58] <johnny> or was that not meant for servers?
[09:44:06] <RandomReader> so BSD sockets for your API?
[09:44:16] <RandomReader> that's what I was asking, since you said "not asio"
[09:44:20] <fluter> yes
[09:44:22] <fluter> socket
[09:44:32] <fluter> and i found it's a not of states to handle
[09:44:39] <fluter> a lot of states

[09:47:10] <RandomReader> not so many with that flow description .. one logical operation is start connect, wait for result (via epoll): it either succeeded or failed .. if succeeded, start send of buffer, and either it sent everything or you need to wait for an event to try the remaining buffer until it completes
[09:47:35] <RandomReader> then recv, until you get the total amount of data you're expecting .. then close
[09:48:41] <RandomReader> the necessary data, including what you're currently doing (e.g. "connecting", "sending" etc) and the buffers can be packaged in a struct
[09:48:51] <fluter> RandomReader: but i can't send all of buffer, each time send only the earliest request,
[09:49:00] <RandomReader> if you need to have multiple in flight at a time, then it's just multiple requests
[09:49:11] <RandomReader> no, I mean the buffer for a single request
[09:49:15] <fluter> each requests requires a connection to be established and destroyed
[09:49:23] <fluter> oh
[09:49:57] <RandomReader> sorry, if you need to have multiple in flight, it's multiple *structs*
[09:50:42] <RandomReader> if you don't, then it's just one struct, and you only have the one fd to put into epoll, so no fancy stuff needed
[09:50:54] <fluter> multiple in queue, but must be sequencial in flight
[09:51:02] <RandomReader> ok so just one at a time then
[09:51:03] <ambasta> Isn't networking TS part of C++20 already?
[09:51:14] <RandomReader> your request queue is a separate thing, you use it to start this process
[09:52:09] <RandomReader> it boils down to a single callback for epoll, check the event for errors, then use your status info to determine what you're doing -> which api call you should be making
[09:52:25] <RandomReader> whether that's just an if block or you dispatch it to separate functions or whatever
[09:52:51] <RandomReader> having a state that flows from connecting -> sending -> receiving is nice in this case

[09:53:49] <RandomReader> sorry, when I say "single callback", I mean single thing to do for this fd
[09:55:46] <RandomReader> ambasta - no, there's still discussion over the API design
[09:56:26] <ambasta> Wow, I thought it was already accepted, is it targeted for ++23?
[09:56:49] <ambasta> Unless you mean executors (which afaik are targeted for 23)
[09:57:48] <RandomReader> last I heard the discussion and subsequent poll meant it's unlikely until after 23

[10:03:15] <RandomReader> personally I don't think any of this is worth standardizing .. to me it just looks like trying to shove different people's individual use cases in, without any consideration for what actually makes sense on all of the hosted platforms C++ is used on
[10:03:39] *** Joins: cm007magnum (~Rheanna@218.78.99.237)
[10:03:46] <RandomReader> which is exactly why the real world has multiple networking APIs, both native and libraries, for various use cases

[10:07:45] <ambasta> Well, I don't expect standards to work for all use cases, as long as they work for the most common ones
[10:08:23] <ambasta> First I've heard of sender/reciever model too
[10:08:28] *** Quits: ville (~ville@178-75-128-81.bb.dnainternet.fi) (Quit: Lost terminal)
[10:08:36] <RandomReader> that's my point though, I don't think there *are* common ones for something as broad as networking
[10:09:05] <RandomReader> some people need infrastructure for high performance event driven servers, some people need infrastructure to make a TLS request to a webserver
[10:09:37] <RandomReader> stdlib certainly can't bake in TLS, the response time is way too long for the security evolution there
[10:10:09] <RandomReader> and the various platforms and app frameworks already have serviceable APIs that fit in with the rest of their models, something stdlib will never be able to do
[10:11:40] <RandomReader> e.g. even just epoll being discussed here, fits in with all kinds of event-driven work on linux, including things like signalfd
[10:12:23] *** Joins: ville (~ville@178-75-128-81.bb.dnainternet.fi)
[10:12:23] <RandomReader> but you have to be at the center of that loop to make effective use of any of that .. and it's evolving, there's what, uring now I think?
[10:13:11] <RandomReader> something standard can't make use of that, and would just end up papering it over badly, since trying to be optimal for epoll means being suboptimal for other platforms
[10:13:38] <ambasta> I don't know the low level details to be able to comment otherwise, but it seems weird to be that something like python's httpilb isn't native to C++
[10:14:47] <RandomReader> what would possibly be the advantage of making it native though?
[10:15:11] <RandomReader> that's a whole pile of bulk and specific design that's now required on many "embedded" platforms
[10:15:24] <ambasta> Well, for one, having multiple third party deps means either I need to ship them, or detect all sort of build systems to build it w/ my own project
[10:15:28] <RandomReader> that makes sense for Python which doesn't even try to target the environments C++ does
[10:15:33] <ambasta> That's a ton of additional code I need to write
[10:15:41] <ambasta> As I said, the most common ones
[10:15:59] <ambasta> Have a separate model for high perf servers and TLS requests
[10:16:00] <RandomReader> those aren't "most common" at all
[10:16:04] <ambasta> But atleast ship something
[10:16:18] <johnny> http is pretty useless witout tls these days tho
[10:16:21] <RandomReader> there are more medical devices using C++ than there are internet-connected clients that would talk http
[10:16:36] <RandomReader> which is what I was getting at with my comments earlier: these are individual use cases, not common ones
[10:16:47] <johnny> isn't that only because c++ isn't used as much as it could be tho RandomReader ?
[10:16:54] <RandomReader> everyone thinks their particular niche is common, when it's simply "popular"
[10:17:14] <ambasta> One of the reasons C++ isn't common in webdev for example, is that doing basic HTTP request/response is a pain
[10:17:19] <RandomReader> that's fair, it's normal, but in the case of C++ it's important not to forget how *broad* it is and therefore what the standard needs to cover
[10:17:23] <ambasta> SerDe is a pain
[10:17:34] <ambasta> Common != common to C++
[10:17:41] <ambasta> Common here = Common to all projects
[10:17:44] <ambasta> In all languages
[10:17:51] <ambasta> Most dev is webdev anyways
[10:17:56] <RandomReader> that's even less true than you think
[10:18:04] <RandomReader> most development is definitely not webdev
[10:18:05] <johnny> ambasta, rust doesn't ship an http client either, but at least it's easy to get!
[10:18:07] <johnny> that's the real problem
[10:18:16] *** Quits: Burgundy (~yomon@86.127.194.72) (Remote host closed the connection)
[10:18:18] <Raziel> are we debating philosophy again?
[10:18:35] <Raziel> and is it a good time to put in my request for passing types around as objects, polymorphic data, and general reflection?
[10:18:54] <ambasta> johnny: Absolutely
[10:19:06] <johnny> some of those are actual language features though not just library features aren't they?
[10:19:46] <RandomReader> reflection is actively being worked on .. I think the other two are non-goals at the moment
[10:20:19] <Raziel> RandomReader, I assume passing types around is gonna logically come after reflection at some point, and polymorphic data is dumb anyway, if a fun concept :p
[10:20:20] <johnny> ambasta, that's what i'd like to see more than shipping a http lib.. i'd rather see something like "blessed librarys" over pulling more into the standard
[10:20:51] <ambasta> I'd be okay with that too
[10:21:23] <johnny> python's standard library is too big and the bignessis unnecessary in a world in which package managers exist
[10:21:26] <Raziel> I'd like to see a dependency managing system that makes sense and actually becomes relatively standardized. that would alleviate many woes.
[10:21:39] <Raziel> personally I don't much mind managing my libs manually, but :/
[10:22:23] <RandomReader> I know package management was part of a discussion, but I can't remember where that sits .. I think they're focusing on something else first
[10:22:28] <johnny> well Raziel i thnk the php community had an interesting answer there.. they got themselves one without any help or assistance (and even resistance) from the php team
[10:22:37] <RandomReader> might be the Modules guidelines I'm thinking of?  fuzzy memory and it's been a while
[10:22:41] <johnny> and it still ended up taking hold in the community
[10:22:52] <RandomReader> but I do remember there was at least interest in trying to make libraries easier to handle
[10:22:55] <Raziel> johnny, that would be perfectly fine by me as well. it just seems like it's not really happening, so far, even though there are a few attempts
[10:23:11] <Raziel> and I guess that begs the question of "why is it not happening?"
[10:23:23] <johnny> because C++ makes it really hard due to history for one
[10:23:27] <RandomReader> which is a bit weird for the standards environment, but it might eventually become something
[10:23:54] <johnny> everybody did their own thing for so long, with all these build systems and whatnot. that wasn't a thing that existed as much on php
[10:24:17] <johnny> and of course, there ws really only one implementation to be concerned with. so only native modules were a problem
[10:24:26] <RandomReader> the C++ standard currently doesn't prescribe tooling at all .. even compilers and linkers are historical artifacts and not covered
[10:25:06] <RandomReader> there's just stages of translation, and people commonly assume the way current tools do things and consider that when making changes to the language as a result, but the standard is careful to avoid defining anything there
[10:25:26] <RandomReader> so it'll be interesting to see what might come out of thinking about libraries, particularly related to Modules
[10:25:45] <ambasta> johnny: package managers as part of the language? Or do you mean distro/plat specific ones
[10:25:52] <johnny> ambasta, hmm?
[10:26:04] <ambasta> Because the latter means there is no simple way for me to pull in a dep
[10:26:13] <johnny> i meant pip, poetry, and things like that
[10:26:25] <ambasta> Ah yeah, that would be good as well
[10:26:40] <johnny> i prefer the pdm approach tho..
[10:26:44] <johnny> for python that i
[10:26:45] <Raziel> ambasta, there's already platform specific woes all over. there's several libraries I avoid simply because of how absolutely awful they are to build under windows. usually anything that starts with "you need mingw" is a no-go.
[10:26:46] <johnny> that is*
[10:26:50] <ambasta> Basically, something that either provides the functionality by default (via STL ot Tooling)
[10:26:57] <RandomReader> something else worth noting is many of the other languages are more like "platforms"
[10:27:04] <johnny> that's indeed true
[10:27:36] <RandomReader> (so they come with library and tooling assumptions, since people need those things for their intended use cases)

[10:38:20] <ambasta> Languages evolve over time
[10:38:25] <Raziel> not literally, hopefully, but
[10:38:59] <Raziel> it wasn't really over time. it was instant. people saw the thing, tried it for a hot few minutes, then said "it's shit" and refused to use it and added it to every bad practice list in existance
[10:39:04] <johnny> at least most of the C libs i might use do have meson support

[10:39:25] <ambasta> johnny: any google project
[10:39:42] <johnny> well i can get google test and things like that at least
[10:40:01] <johnny> and if htey use cmake, it's fine anyways
[10:40:51] <johnny> i dun like cmake's fetchcontent approach at all
[10:41:03] <johnny> it should be a totally separate file with the metadata
[10:41:17] <Raziel> I don't even know how to approach findpackage on windows
[10:41:26] <Raziel> where in the balls is it even looking? and what is it looking for?!
[10:41:33] <ambasta> I ended up w/ cmake because I needed or-tools, librdkafka and mongocxx drivers

[10:42:29] <johnny> would be nice to hae a proper boost wrap, but it's also not simple :(
[10:42:31] <Raziel> there's one project I was trying to play around with that has "find_package(FFMPEG COMPONENTS avcodec avutil)" in its cmakelists
[10:42:44] <ambasta> Raziel: Well maybe, but something like asio has been use for a while now
[10:42:45] <Raziel> ffmpeg has never been a cmake project
[10:42:54] <Raziel> what am I supposed to provide and where am I supposed to put it?
[10:43:33] <johnny> i wish ffmpeg would go away :(
[10:43:46] <johnny> or they would modularize it at least
[10:43:55] <Raziel> yeah, a better/modern-er alternative would be nice
[10:44:02] <johnny> that's gstreamer isn't it?
[10:44:20] <Raziel> ambasta, so you're arguing that asio should just be part of the std? because, yes, it probably should be. lol
[10:44:37] <ambasta> Raziel: Yeah, that's how this whole discussion started
[10:44:38] <ville> it probably shouldn't
[10:44:46] <Raziel> aaaand that's what I mean. :p
[10:44:51] <ambasta> I was informed that while the TS is published, its not STL yet
[10:44:53] <Raziel> with the "community can't agree on anything"
[10:45:22] <ville> sure they can
[10:45:38] <ville> if you switch the community with committee
[10:45:54] <ville> it doesn't matter what the community thinks
[10:46:39] <Raziel> it does matter if no one using the language uses your fancy new feature or lib because everyone says it's shit, even though you (wherein you is the committee) thought it was the bee's knees
[10:47:08] <Raziel> it indicates either incompetence or extreme amounts of disconnect from the actual users of the language
[10:47:22] <ambasta> I think it just indicates self-preservation :D
[10:47:50] <johnny> the second is my impression already Raziel .. although perhaps more so about the future than the present
[10:48:39] <johnny> i don't think it's a goal of the committee to care about the future users of the language
[10:48:42] <Raziel> compared to the early 00s or so, I'd argue it's gotten better rather than worse, but it's still behind and slow
[10:49:21] <johnny> i'm only hear because i ended up helping out a project that happened to be written in C++.. i wouldn't have started it in C++
[10:49:50] <Raziel> right, and that makes sense to an extent. but, if they want C++ to still be "good" and "relevant" in the future, then they must also care about the future users.
[10:49:55] <ville> johnny: that's already false. teachability is brought up multiple times over the years in the committee
[10:50:10] <Raziel> that's definitely a good sign
[10:50:12] <johnny> "brought up"
[10:50:51] <johnny> i've seen a lot of folks talk about teachability in regards to not adding new features that would make the language easier to use

[10:53:12] <ambasta> I used to make fun of BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in)); and then I am using = std::chrono::system_clock::now().time_since_epoch :D
[10:53:50] <johnny> i think the static methods of std::chrono aren't too bad
[10:54:02] <johnny> like that one in particular with retrning the object from now() is actually totally fine
[10:54:41] <ambasta> Its overly verbose, is all
[10:54:45] <johnny> i don't knwo what's wrong with that BufferedReader, i mean seems like a decent enough setup..  a regular stream reader you want buffered
[10:55:22] <ambasta> I think they added something like cin later, which is what should have been in the first place
[10:55:25] <Raziel> ambasta, ever properly initialized a std rng generator?
[10:55:32] <ambasta> Hahaha Yes
[10:55:45] <Raziel> inline std::random_device rd; inline std::seed_seq sseq{ static_cast<long unsigned int>(rd()), static_cast<long unsigned int>(std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now().time_since_epoch().count()) }; inline std::mt19937_64 rng(sseq);
[10:55:47] <johnny> well it'd be nice if the committee considered libraries that were more like wrappers of existing apis
[10:55:48] <Raziel> beautiful. :p
[10:56:22] <johnny> like std::chrono_simple::now()  something to assume dealing with the system clock
[10:58:02] <Raziel> I don't think the verbosity itself is that big an issue in most cases, it's not like we're trying to save space on the .cpp filesize
[10:58:15] <Raziel> it becomes an issue when things are confusing or shitty to read
[10:58:20] <johnny> guess you need std::make_random_generator()
[10:58:55] <johnny> with the defaultarg of a generator that owrks best on the platform
[10:59:11] <ambasta> Yeah, which is why, common use cases
[10:59:49] <ambasta> Have the long winded forms for non-trivial scenarios, for the trivial ones, have simpler syntax, libraries etc
[11:00:00] <ambasta> Where you forgo some perf if needed to make the language more usable
[11:00:02] <johnny> teachability may have been "brough up" multiple times, but the api of both the random number generator and std::chrono both show that it's not a blocer
[11:00:21] <johnny> and until ti's a blocker, C++ will be like this
[11:01:18] <ambasta> I guess teachability is what I have an issue w/ as well
[11:01:37] <Raziel> I mean, the apis themselves do make sense. it's just a bit ugh. could definitely be improved, although I'm not sure if I could come up with improvements that make sense
[11:02:06] <Raziel> "higher-level" wrappers for ease of use could be nice, but then you'd potentially have to deal with two APIs instead.
[11:02:33] <ambasta> Well, users provide problems, the comittee should resolve them, when it looks like, the answer generally is WONTFIX
[11:03:07] <ambasta> Two APIs shoudl be fine? People use httplib/requests in python all the time, depending on what they need
[11:03:41] <Raziel> I suppose, as long as it doesn't go out of hand
[11:03:45] <johnny> heck.. why do designated initializers for structs require them to be in order of the struct definition? what's the technical reason for that?
[11:04:13] <Raziel> johnny, whaddaya mean?
[11:04:16] <ambasta> Was recently introduced to these when trying to understand boost::MPL
[11:04:29] <ville> johnny: order of initialization
[11:04:31] <ambasta> also, designated initializers are a hack :P Not a supported feature

[11:04:39] <ambasta> Raziel: https://www.cppstories.com/2021/designated-init-cpp20/
[11:04:49] <johnny> not a supported feature?

[11:05:10] <johnny> ville, why can't compilers be smart enough to figure it out?
[11:05:40] <ambasta> johnny: Well, you shouldn't need a struct to implement it in the first place
[11:06:20] <ambasta> template <typename X, typename Y=.., typename Z=..> something; Something<X, Z=hello>
[11:06:27] <johnny> why said iwanted atemplate?
[11:06:42] <Raziel> I'm guessing it works on top of the previous list init, in which you need order for obvious reasons?

[11:13:17] <ambasta> Ooh, you might know this. Is it possible to do what mingw does for win based libraries via a gcc and a windows library instead
[11:14:00] <ville> johnny: so there's your answer
[11:14:04] <ambasta> For example, dxvk needs mingw, would it be feasible to write a libwindows instead that dxvk could use to compile with gcc
[11:14:43] <johnny> libwindows that does what?
[11:15:05] <johnny> mingw has a gcc, so what exactly are you asking?
[11:15:22] <ambasta> I'm not sure what mingw does, but it provides headers such as windows.h
[11:15:50] <ambasta> Why does mingw fork gcc is what I am asking I think
[11:17:02] <johnny> so you're asking why things like #include "windows.h" aren't part of gcc itself?
[11:17:24] <johnny> or, that maybe #include "windows.h" could be completely outside of mingw, and thus be usable with a regular gcc?
[11:17:27] <ambasta> No, I'm asking if they can be shipped as a library, so i don't need mingw as a second compiler
[11:18:05] <ambasta> Yeah, that
[11:18:20] <johnny> i can't say i've looked into mingw enough to know, but you could easily prove it yourself by pointing a regular gcc at the headers for mingw
[11:18:39] <johnny> there's got to be a description of that somewhere
[11:18:40] <ville> ambasta: mingw is not just gcc. it's bunch of stuff on top of that
[11:18:42] <ambasta> So in dxvk, I could do somethign like find_package(windows) , target_compile(dxvk windows::windows)
[11:18:59] <johnny> but like Raziel does, i generally avoid things that depend on mingw
[11:19:24] <ville> top? in addition?
[11:19:30] <ambasta> ville: Could you please provide an example of what cannot be achived with a library based on gcc
[11:19:31] <Raziel> mingw's technical purpose is to provide more posix support and gcc on windows
[11:19:44] <ville> ambasta: i don't understand the question
[11:19:51] <Raziel> and people use it because it allows linux coders to put zero effort into adapting any of their code to a different platform
[11:19:53] <Raziel> >_>
[11:20:03] <johnny> unix coders* :)
[11:20:13] <Raziel> more or less
[11:20:32] <johnny> hmm.. what do folks do with clang in this regard i wonder.. did somebody ever build such a thing like mingw, but not gnu and not licensed like that?
[11:20:41] <ambasta> ville: well, if my objective is to say build a package like dxvk (which currently uses mingw on linux) using gcc, what does this work entail
[11:20:57] <johnny> now your'e talking about cross compiling?
[11:21:05] <johnny> the reason to use mingw on linux is to cross compile for windows
[11:21:16] <johnny> and there's no msvc available for unix
[11:21:55] <johnny> so it's basicaly saying.. here's a somewhat windowslike environment for you to build for
[11:22:38] <ambasta> I thought cross compile was to build for windows (say building an exe on linux)
[11:22:53] <ville> ambasta: the result of building dxvk needs to be in a format which windows programs understand. right? you would use the resulting library for programs that run under wine for example?
[11:23:27] <johnny> ambasta, yes. the dxvk folks use mingw to cross compile don't they?
[11:23:47] <johnny> that's how the dxvk builds work in wine
[11:24:24] <johnny> as to wehther the headers here https://github.com/jonasstrandstedt/MinGW/tree/master/MinGW/include coul be split out, the answer here is.. probably?
[11:24:52] <ambasta> I think I don't completely understand what dxvk does then
[11:25:29] <johnny> well the common case is that dxvk gets built as dlls to run under wine and proton
[11:25:37] <Raziel> dxvk is a library, no? normally a dyanmic library which overrides dx function signatures with stuff that calls vulkan equivalents instead
[11:25:40] <Raziel> basically.
[11:25:54] <johnny> and they replace existing windows dlls to map dx calls to vulkan
[11:26:10] <Raziel> ^
[11:26:27] <ville> ambasta: were you hoping to call DX functions from your linux program?
[11:26:49] <ambasta> No, I was hoping to build dxvk w/o needing mingw
[11:27:19] <johnny> well i'd like to be abe to build dxvk with msvc, but that doesn't seem feasible yet
[11:27:21] <ambasta> Basically, no-multilib system
[11:27:24] <Raziel> well dxvk makes no sense without windows stuff. specifically, directx.
[11:27:24] <Raziel> since its whole purpose is to replace directx calls with vulkan ones v:
[11:27:37] <Raziel> johnny, the feels are reals
[11:27:42] <ville> ambasta: well you seem to have some disconnect there then...
[11:27:50] <ambasta> I thought it was similar to wine
[11:28:07] <johnny> ambasta, multilib is unrelated to this (mostly, depending on what you mean by it)
[11:28:12] <ambasta> ville: Yep, I don't quite understand the wine/dxvk ecosystem (or cross compile for that matter)
[11:28:24] <ambasta> johnny: mingw won't build w/o multilib
[11:28:25] <johnny> most people refer to multilib in the context of 32bit libraries on 64bit systes
[11:28:56] <johnny> that's what i hear wheni hear multilib
[11:29:26] <johnny> does mingw have a different definition of multilib?
[11:29:40] <johnny> maybe thye mean providing the posix and windows apis

[11:30:21] <johnny> i'm way more into the linux distro side, so i almost always hear the first definition
[11:30:46] <RandomReader> ambasta - from quick skimming, the relationship is that dxvk is *for* wine, which provides a windows-ish binary environment
[11:30:55] <RandomReader> the gcc toolchain isn't capable of targeting that
[11:30:58] <ville> https://github.com/Joshua-Ashton/dxvk-native/

[11:37:40] <ville> ambasta: anyways there're two use cases for "dxvk". one where you use it under wine and that's when you use a toolchain that can produce "windows code". two where you use it under linux and use the regular toolchain
[11:38:09] <johnny> ambasta, i wanted you to clarify what you meant by multilib though though
[11:38:31] <ambasta> ville: Yeah, I think what you mentioed before helped.. until now .. I thought dxvk was something in wine that hijacked dll calls and converted that to vulkan
[11:38:32] <Raziel> ville, why would a usecase exist for using dxvk under linux, when any binaries that would use dx can't be ran under linux?
[11:38:37] <ambasta> Except this happens in the windows dll itself
[11:38:38] <Raziel> what am I missing there
[11:38:42] <ambasta> Not on the wine end
[11:39:01] <johnny> i do know at some point in the near future a 64bit wine will be able to run 32bit windows binaries with no 32bit libs installed on the host side
[11:39:15] <ville> ambasta: yes it is pretty much exactly that. to produce said dll you need a toolchain that is able to produce "windows code"
[11:39:30] <ville> i guess code is bad choice there. "windows binaries"
[11:39:47] <ambasta> Couldn't the same thing be done w/o needing windows binaries? i.e. wine itself emulate dx calls via vulkan
[11:39:58] <johnny> no, the dlls themselves are windows binaries

[11:46:48] <Raziel> then again, direct translation of calls won't necessarily get good performance either.
[11:46:58] <Raziel> otherwise people would just replace-all the damn calls >_>
[11:48:04] <ville> ambasta: i've not looked at how wine does its business in this regard. presumably the dx->opengl part is implemented similarly to what dxvk does. a dll that translates to "native" calls
[11:48:05] <johnny> omg. https://froggi.es/website/site/
[11:48:19] <Raziel> actually, that is a good point though. why is there no static equivalent to dxvk, which just rewrites the code, instead of doing translation on runtime

[11:50:59] <johnny> you know that it will in fact require mingw soonish right?
[11:51:01] <ambasta> Yeah, corrected above
[11:51:09] <johnny> well the windows half of it
[11:51:13] <ambasta> I did not know that :/
[11:51:46] <johnny> ambasta, the main effort going on in wine is to split it into 2 pieces, the unix side and the windows side.
[11:52:31] <johnny> wine recently started requring Faudio and other libraries to be built as real PE dlls and thus require something that will compile to PE dlls
[11:53:00] <johnny> and since there's no msvc on unix, mingw is your only choice
[11:54:23] <ambasta> So apparent, wine is already doing what I wanted, which is this https://www.winehq.org/pipermail/wine-devel/2019-January/138023.html
[11:57:25] <johnny> ambasta, they really want a) folks to be able to run 32bit win32 binaries on arm (especially now with the apple m1 stuff) b) folks to be able run 32bit applications without 32bit libaries on the host side on regular linux distros
[11:58:02] <johnny> and that's not gonna be able to happne until all of wine use real PE executables on the windows side
[11:58:05] <ambasta> Also the PE level changes are post wine 6.22?

[11:58:34] <johnny> that was in wine 6.21 wasn't it?
[11:58:55] <johnny> or did they just import the source in preparation? i can't remember
[11:58:59] <ambasta> Well, can definitely build 6.22 w/o mingw

[12:01:02] <johnny> i totally forgot about that
[12:02:26] <johnny> i still think you'll be ending up with mingw eventually tho
[12:02:46] <ambasta> winegcc must have shipped as part of wine itself
[12:02:54] <johnny> it is
[12:03:10] <ambasta> Hmm, might try building dxvk w/ winegcc then :D
[12:03:11] <johnny> it's been part of wine for almost as long as winelib
[12:03:56] <johnny> ambasta, if winegcc was a reasonable choice, wouldn't dxvk already be using it?
[12:04:21] <ambasta> I don't think I'll get it to work, but at least want to understand this ecosystem better
[12:05:30] <johnny> well first you should probably understand the differences between elf and pe , an hten also the differences in the available C libraires
[12:05:52] <johnny> like glibc vs the ms c runtime or whatever they call it
[12:06:23] <ambasta> Well, yes.. but easier to understand w/ handson vs reading in general
[12:06:23] <johnny> if the ms c runtime (or whatever it is) was open source under a reasonable license, then i bet most of mingw wouldn't exist

[12:59:37] <LordKalma> the thing is, since we don't exactly understand what you mean, it's easy to think - and I at least do - that maybe you're not asking what you really mean
[12:59:42] <LordKalma> thus let code speak for itself
[12:59:42] <lpapp> This answer seems to suggest that dllexport/import needs to be in both: https://coderedirect.com/questions/525222/exporting-global-variables-from-dll for variables
[12:59:57] <lpapp> with extern in the header.
[13:00:09] <cbreak> lpapp: if you expose function pointers directly, you don't need to deal with exported symbols
[13:00:27] <lpapp> cbreak: what do you mean directly?
[13:00:47] <cbreak> if your library gives function pointers to the host application via some plugin API for example
[13:01:01] <lpapp> function pointer is the plugin api
[13:01:05] <lpapp> so not sure what you mean
[13:01:42] <cbreak> let's imagine there's some plugin API in which you get to call setCallback(FP)
[13:01:59] <lpapp> that is no different to fp = myfp;
[13:02:02] <cbreak> you can pass function pointers there without regard for any symbols involved
[13:02:05] <lpapp> in terms of symbol visiblity
[13:02:11] <lpapp> not really
[13:02:24] <ville> lpapp: making a symbol visible from your dll doesn't depend on its pointer-to-function-ness
[13:02:24] <lpapp> of course, you must export setCallback
[13:02:28] <cbreak> those function pointers can easily point to functions that don't even have symbols
[13:02:37] *** Joins: smallville7123 (~smallvill@cpe-172-193-200-97.qld.foxtel.net.au)
[13:02:40] <cbreak> lpapp: yeah, but that's not the question
[13:02:50] <lpapp> well, setCallback is not the question
[13:02:50] <cbreak> setCallback would be part of the host application's API
[13:02:57] <lpapp> that is a different topic
[13:03:20] <cbreak> the point is as I said above: function pointers are independent from symbols
[13:03:37] <ville> cbreak: not sure that translates well
[13:03:44] <lpapp> The application would have no visibility to the function pointer if it was not exposed.
[13:03:50] <LordKalma> they can be a syumbol or not be a symbol
[13:04:06] <lpapp> therefore, it has to be exposed
[13:04:08] <cbreak> no
[13:04:12] <lpapp> my question was the best way
[13:04:13] <cbreak> function pointers are values
[13:04:23] <cbreak> they can be given out via means different to a variable
[13:04:24] <lpapp> how would you use an unexported and unimported symbol from a dll?
[13:04:27] <Haohmaru> schroedinger's pointer
[13:04:34] <cbreak> lpapp: I gave you an example
[13:04:39] <lpapp> that is not an example
[13:04:41] <cbreak> via some registration function
[13:04:42] <LordKalma> and extern values must be exported, cbreak
[13:04:51] <lpapp> that is a difference scenario where you have a setCallback, which anyway would need to be exported and imported
[13:05:01] <lpapp> and in any case, we do not have that, and do not want to have that.
[13:05:01] <LordKalma> and cbreak you're thinking like app plugins, and I think we're talking about library development
[13:05:03] <cbreak> there are other options: via a custom symbol resolution API
[13:05:25] <cbreak> LordKalma: for library development you'd usually not use function pointers but functions though
[13:05:36] <LordKalma> yes
[13:05:43] <LordKalma> I don't understand the use case either, as I said
[13:05:46] <LordKalma> but hey
[13:05:47] <LordKalma> it's there
[13:06:08] <lpapp> cbreak: it is ok to say that you do not know how to expose a function pointer if you do not know :)
[13:06:16] <LordKalma> I mean, i've seen libraries with like `extern char mylib_version[];`
[13:06:19] <ville> cbreak: for opengl or vulkan you may possibly provide the pointer-to-function symbols though, as you're supposed to load them at runtime anyways.
[13:06:21] <lpapp> but there is no point in discussing a different topic for myself.
[13:06:40] <LordKalma> but with function pointers never saw it around I think, personally
[13:06:43] <LordKalma> but I guess you could
[13:07:16] <LordKalma> ville, well, for runtime loading of libraries, I've wrote code like this: https://gist.github.com/ruilvo/904006faf16cab656a4344e291b312c1
[13:07:18] <lpapp> "you would usually not use function pointers, but functions though" is of course personal taste.

[14:14:13] <cbreak> so while building the main application, your header will try to export instead of import the symbol
[14:14:21] <lpapp> ?
[14:14:29] <lpapp> no, I have a macro to manage dllexport/import.
[14:14:36] <cbreak> yes...
[14:14:39] <cbreak> you do target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE lib)
[14:14:44] <cbreak> so you link "lib" to main
[14:14:51] <cbreak> you have target_compile_definitions(lib PUBLIC DSO_BUILD=1)
[14:15:01] <cbreak> so lib exports a public definition DSO_BUILD
[14:15:10] <cbreak> that means that while building the library, that thing will be defined

[14:18:41] <cbreak> it's defined for both if you use PUBLIC
[14:18:45] <lpapp> odd
[14:18:50] <cbreak> it's defined only for yourself if you use PRIVATE
[14:18:58] <cbreak> and it's defined only for users if you use INTERFACE
[14:19:12] <cbreak> I think that's one of the places where cmake is actually reasonable
[14:19:56] <lpapp> the problem with is that the app needs to be aware of how the library is built

[14:23:45] <cbreak> don't see what makes you come to this conclusion
[14:24:18] <lpapp> well, simple: if the library is built in this way with PUBLIC, the app would need to know to override that with 0
[14:24:53] <cbreak> no. that just means that who ever set up the library WANTS this definition to be used at link time
[14:25:15] <cbreak> you obviously would only use PUBLIC for definitions that are meant to be public
[14:25:57] <cbreak> for example things like MYLIB_USE_DEPENDENCY_X, MYLIB_MAX_PATH_LENGTH or similar things, that must be defined in the same way when building and using
[14:26:24] <cbreak> for your definition, which you only want to be defined while building, but not while using, you would use PRIVATE

[14:27:17] <lpapp> if something is hard-coded to one value, it should be done in the code so.
[14:27:53] <cbreak> it's not hard-coded
[14:28:00] <cbreak> it's configurable via definitions
[14:28:01] <lpapp> that is the issue
[14:28:07] <lpapp> suddenly, the lib and the app are coupled.

[14:28:20] <cbreak> one links to the other...
[14:28:26] <lpapp> not in this way.
[14:28:34] <cbreak> and if a library is compiled with feature X enabled, then users need to know about it
[14:28:40] <cbreak> if a library is compiled without it, then too
[14:28:59] <cbreak> for example, I recently made a library that does image processing, on float pixel by default
[14:29:09] <lpapp> In my opinion, the default compilation condition should be done in the code, not outside.
[14:29:14] <cbreak> but if enabled when compiling the library, I expose additional functions that support half
[14:29:31] <cbreak> this obviously requires macros to be controlled
[14:29:49] <cbreak> and the macros are controlled from cmake, since it is via cmake that the library is compiled
[14:30:14] <cbreak> if I enable the feature of "half support" in the library, this, among other things, defines a macro
[14:30:31] <cbreak> this macro must be defined when building the library, to enable the parts containing half support
[14:30:35] <LordKalma> ah I remember, lpapp is the person against build systems configuring stuff
[14:30:39] <cbreak> they also need to be defined when using the library
[14:31:03] <cbreak> because, obviously, the header contains function declarations for half support, which must be hidden when the feature is not enabled
[14:31:09] <cbreak> lpapp: as you see, there's no way around this
[14:31:14] <LordKalma> cbreak, lpapp was against https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/GenerateExportHeader.html iirc

[16:39:55] <lpapp> the app does not need to override the default behaviour
[16:40:03] <lpapp> it is more like a setting than init.
[16:40:18] <lpapp> But the point I am trying to make, I guess, is that it keeps the API simpler.
[16:40:38] <lpapp> whereas with an "init" (set) method for each pointer, you would add a bit of clutter.
[16:41:19] <PJBoy> cart_man, sounds like a basic usage of std::lock_guard
[16:41:29] <ville> lpapp: you do a single init() that does whatever your object's ctor would have

[16:54:08] <PJBoy> but it could be worse
[16:54:10] <LordKalma> trailing return type on main is so shit

[16:55:07] <Haohmaru> but why "-> int" ?!
[16:55:08] <LordKalma> you can silence the warning by writing main(int, char**)
[16:55:12] <PJBoy> it's not too bad, but it's insanely noisy
[16:55:25] <LordKalma> Haohmaru, sometimes trailing return type is important, and necessary in TMP
[16:55:29] <PJBoy> and the "maybe" part is usually a complete lie

[16:56:24] <LordKalma> but someone in #include<c++> discord was saying they always use trailing return
[16:56:27] <Haohmaru> LordKalma the reason i got warnings is because i conditionally don't use the arguments and inject hard-coded arguments because i'm testing the program with a few particular input files

[19:40:04] <ezzieyguywuf> PJBoy: is the comparison checking memory addresses and not the actual content?

[19:43:30] <cbreak> tell them their styleguide is stupid.
[19:43:54] <ezzieyguywuf> PJBoy: specifically " Do not use any such literals provided by others (including the standard library)."
[19:44:02] <PJBoy> > Because they can't be namespace-qualified, uses of UDLs also require use of either using-directives (which we ban) or using-declarations (which we ban in header files except when the imported names are part of the interface exposed by the header file in question). Given that header files would have to avoid UDL suffixes, we prefer to avoid having conventions for literals differ between...
[19:44:03] <ezzieyguywuf> cbreak: I will, if I get a job there :-P
[19:44:03] <PJBoy> ...header files and source files
[19:44:07] <PJBoy> well
[19:44:16] <PJBoy> given that they ban using directives, it makes a bit of sense
[19:44:30] <PJBoy> and then it's just a case of disagreeing with banning using directives
[19:44:35] <ezzieyguywuf> PJBoy: why does that make it make more sense?
[19:44:52] <PJBoy> like that string_view UDL comes from namespace std::string_literals
[19:44:58] <PJBoy> you have to using that namespace
[19:45:09] <PJBoy> and namespacing UDLs does make sense
[19:45:15] <ezzieyguywuf> ohhhh yea
[19:45:27] <ezzieyguywuf> is there a way to use the literal _without_ the using directive?
[19:45:31] <cbreak> importing UDLs into the current scope also makes sense.
[19:45:33] <ezzieyguywuf> "123"std::sv or something?
[19:46:01] <PJBoy> `operator std::string_literals::sv("123")` probably
[19:46:02] <cbreak> using std::string_literals::sv or similar I think.
[19:46:22] <PJBoy> apparently not
[19:46:26] <PJBoy> yeah I dunno
[19:46:34] <ezzieyguywuf> `using sv = std::string_literals::sv` sounds kosher with their style guidelines if used in implementation file
[19:47:02] <ezzieyguywuf> i.e. 'using declaration' if I'm interpretting that correctly
[19:47:23] <ezzieyguywuf> but again, they explicitly say not to use the literals

[20:48:36] <Alipha> cart_man: if it's an ifstream opened in binary mode, you can use tellg()

[20:52:19] <lpapp> Alipha: I have not seen. But I thought friend is kind of silly to be the source of truth

[21:58:40] <yolo> so swig provides language-binding for c/c++ libraries, what about just providing a json-rpc interface so any language can use the library as long as they send json-rpc requests? thus void all those bindings
[21:59:09] <LordKalma> that would imply an executable, and lots of data marshalling
[21:59:12] <LordKalma> so probably no
[21:59:16] <kalven> remove the stone of language bindings, attach the stone of rpc interface
[21:59:25] <PJBoy> bahahaha
[21:59:31] <PJBoy> a stonecutters reference
[21:59:52] <PJBoy> I see you are a man of culture
[22:00:37] <yolo> json-rpc marshall is not that heavy plus you can invoke the library remotely too, which language-binding can not. I do intend to make my little library remotely/locally consumable
[22:01:04] <LordKalma> an rpc interface involves an executable
[22:01:18] <kalven> if you introduce the possibility of making remote calls, you also introduce a lot of new and exciting failure modes

[23:51:13] <CarloWood> I thought of that, but it doesn't work here.
[23:52:10] <CarloWood> It's for a very specific use case, so you probably won't have enough information unless there is an english word that just has that meaning (source and destination).
[23:52:26] <CarloWood> I thought of "Address", or "Station". But no. To location-like.
[23:52:32] <CarloWood> It is more a State.

[23:55:38] <CarloWood> The vulkan spec uses 'src' and 'dst', but always talks about three or four such variables (stage, access, layout, queue family ownership).
[23:56:01] <CarloWood> I want to put those four in a single struct; and then that struct can used as src or dst.
[23:56:10] <CarloWood> can be*
