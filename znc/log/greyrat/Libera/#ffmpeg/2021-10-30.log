[17:51:44] <Fohsap> The audio track in this film has very very loud action scenes and very very quiet dialogues....
[17:52:10] <Fohsap> If I turn it up, it pretty much rips my eardrums out and wakes up my family.  If I turn it down, I literally can't hear a word they say.
[17:52:42] <Fohsap> is it called normalizing?

[19:26:48] <oliv3> i'm still working on my reproducibility issue (tl;dr: i encode 2 videos with the same input, random seeds etc and the result should be the same, but for some strange reason it's not)

[19:30:32] <oliv3> `ffmpeg -loglevel quiet -i video1.mp4 -f framehash - | grep -v " 1," > out1.sha256` is this correct ? the `grep -v` is here because (dunno why) but frames with a duration of 1s differ from one encoding to another

[19:32:15] <kepstin> you should be saving the framehash output to a file separately for each video and then diffing them.
[19:32:33] <oliv3> that's exactly what i'm doing :)
[19:32:38] <oliv3> and guess what ?
[19:32:42] <oliv3> there's no diff
[19:32:54] <kepstin> one thing you might consider doing is instead of encoding to h264, have your "encoder" command do the framehash, and verify that the *input* to the ffmpeg command is the same between runs
[19:33:03] <kepstin> ok, then what's the problem?
[19:33:35] <oliv3> well if the videos differ, the hashes should differ, shoulnd't they ?

[19:33:53] <kepstin> yep. so i guess they don't actually differ?
[19:34:07] <kepstin> can't tell anything from your side-by-side video since that's a lossy re-encode
[19:34:20] <oliv3> that's not what you can see in comparison.mp4 ?

[19:36:47] <kepstin> my best guess is that you're not actually comparing the same files :/
[19:37:20] <oliv3> ?
[19:37:39] <kepstin> like, the files that you're using for the framehashes aren't the same as the files used to make the comparison video
[19:37:50] <oliv3> they are
[19:38:18] <kepstin> well, if you open the two original files separately in players and seek to 1:56 or so, are they different?

[19:46:34] <kepstin> ok. so a few things - on your encoding command, remove the "-re" input option. it just makes the command run pointlessly slower, this is a batch operation not a realtime stream.

[19:48:33] <kepstin> and the fact that your hashes differ... is because the hashes differ. filtering out the differences doesn't make them go away.

[19:54:24] <oliv3> when it was reproducible (in the past)
[19:54:39] <oliv3> the hashes were 99.9999% the same

[19:54:56] <oliv3> there were only those "duration" hashes differing
[19:55:21] <kepstin> the hashes are of the frames in the decoded video. if they're different, then the frames are different

[21:00:41] <oliv3> 1: Invalid argument
[21:01:07] <furq> -bitexact doesn't take an argument
[21:01:34] <oliv3> thanks

[21:17:08] <oliv3> [mp4 @ 0x560db1c33280] Could not find tag for codec pcm_s16le in stream #1, codec not currently supported in container
[21:18:13] <kepstin> ah, that's why i had that qualifier "if the audio is preencoded" :/
[21:18:39] <oliv3> it isn't ?

[21:22:50] <kepstin> well, you have a wav file with uncompressed pcm audio, which isn't a format supported in mp4 files
[21:23:04] <kepstin> so you have to encode that to some format which is supported
[21:23:29] <kepstin> (i dunno what you got before, it might have been aac, and it could depend on ffmpeg version. doesn't help that you didn't specify what encoder to use)
[21:23:54] <oliv3> would flac be ok ?
[21:25:00] <kepstin> depends on the ffmpeg version. you can put flac into mp4, but in some ffmpeg versions it might be marked as experimental or not supported.
[21:25:09] <oliv3> or is it better to drop "-c:a copy" ?
[21:25:26] <kepstin> you can't use -c:a copy here unless the source file is in a format that can be copied into mp4
[21:25:40] <kepstin> you'd have to replace "copy" with the audio encoder you'd like to use.
[21:26:14] <oliv3> well -c:a mp3 then ?
[21:26:37] <oliv3> wild guess :)
[21:26:39] <kepstin> the name of the encoder, not the name of the format.
[21:26:44] <kepstin> so libmp3lame for example
[21:26:57] <oliv3> ok i try that, thanks
[21:27:14] <kepstin> (you'd probably want >128kbps for lame, but that's up to personal preference)

[21:28:27] <oliv3> no idea how to set that :(
[21:30:35] <kepstin> you're already setting that - the "-b:a 128k" option sets the audio encoding bitrate.
[21:31:05] <oliv3> oh ok
[21:31:18] <oliv3> 128k is the default setting and can be configurable

[22:27:39] <kepstin> i don't think that's the default? but anyways you're explicitly setting it.

[22:41:43] <oliv3> i meant https://gitlab.com/lebiniou/lebiniou/-/blob/master/plugins/output/mp4/mp4.c#L82-86
[22:42:41] <oliv3> i'd have to check but the dev told me 128j is ffmpeg's default
[22:42:49] <oliv3> *128k
[22:57:09] <kepstin> you'd have to know the specific encoder in use; defaults can vary from encoder to encoder.
