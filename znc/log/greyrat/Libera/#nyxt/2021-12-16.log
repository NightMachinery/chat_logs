[21:13:16] <mariari> jmercouris: I've found some really weird behavior with nyxt
[21:13:21] <mariari> it downloads a normal page
[21:13:34] <mariari> https://yunomi.life/products/hachimanjyu-naturally-grown-hisoka-spring-first-flush-green-tea-yutaka-midori nyxt goes to download this
[21:13:46] <mariari> https://pomf2.lain.la/f/6l79uzie.png
[21:14:01] <mariari> same with a keyboard website
[21:23:07] <lagash> Kabouik: we scared him off..? :P
[21:24:17] <lagash> What's the FotD now? My German flashcards included "Die Tomate ist noch grün." translated as "The tomato is still green."
[21:45:46] <jmercouris> Jing: due to issues with pkg-config
[21:46:01] <jmercouris> We have to fix it… it isn’t that your code is broken :-D
[21:47:24] <jmercouris> Kabouik: so, that is the prompt buffer background
[21:47:55] <jmercouris> The new theme would help in this case, the only code example is in the PR that Artyom made
[21:48:11] <jmercouris> It would just simplify the things you have to do
[21:48:22] <jmercouris> Anyways, I hope to make an article about it in some weeks
[21:48:31] <jmercouris> There is so much to write about and so little time!
[21:48:58] <jmercouris> mariari: that is extremely odd, because it checks the mime rule before downloading
[21:49:10] <mariari> jmercouris: does it try to download for you as well?
[21:49:14] <jmercouris> Perhaps those websites have misconfigured servers that other browsers know how to handle
[21:49:15] <mariari> I noticed it on the dactyle keyboard as well
[21:49:21] <mariari> wait wtf
[21:49:24] <mariari> that one works now
[21:49:29] <mariari> https://ohkeycaps.com/products/built-to-order-dactyl-manuform-keyboard this link was doing a download a couple weeks ago
[21:49:31] <jmercouris> mariari: I will try in a second I’m still on my phone
[21:49:35] <mariari> gotcha
[21:49:45] <mariari> please do see if you have it. as this site magically works again
[21:49:56] <jmercouris> Ok will do
[21:50:05] <jmercouris> Also lagash the fruit of the day today is pomelo
[21:50:24] <jmercouris> Happy pomelo Thursday everyone :-)
[21:54:07] <Jing> Happy pomelo Thursday. jmercouris Just curious about the cause. I know it's not my code since 5 most recent commits do not build as well
[22:08:41] <Kabouik> Hum but I tried adding background-color to my prompt-buffer without a sub css class, got the same result jmercouris
[22:09:28] <Kabouik> lagash Now, actually it was hard to reply to him because he was connecting through the webchat and was not here for a long time usually, but I think aartaka did answer him about some of his issues, and in his video he did say that the channel is active and answers relatively fast
[22:09:52] <Kabouik> s/Now/No
[22:14:25] <jmercouris> Jing: so basically pkg-config sets up a bunch of shell environmental variables for compilation, however, these environmental variables were running in a new shell and not effecting the shell in which complication is taking place
[22:14:50] <jmercouris> This is because UIOP:RUN-PROGRAM is not behaving as expected!
[22:15:21] <jmercouris> At least that’s as far as I understand the problem, compilers are not my specialty :-D
[22:15:52] <jmercouris> S/complication/compilation
[22:22:36] <Kabouik> So I added the line where my cursor is to my theme jmercouris, but that didn't changethe prompt buffer background: https://0x0.st/-CoB.png
[22:24:26] <jmercouris> hm
[22:24:34] <jmercouris> Kabouik: can you give me your whole theme so I can try it?
[22:24:39] <jmercouris> maybe I can spot the issue
[22:24:56] <jmercouris> you might also try the classic !important
[22:25:05] <jmercouris> to see if it is not being overridden by something
[22:25:08] <jmercouris> somewhere over the rainbow
[22:26:28] <jmercouris> shame that he died so young
[22:26:33] <jmercouris> but considering his weight, it is not surprising
[22:28:33] <jmercouris> apparently at one point he was 750+ lbs
[22:28:36] <jmercouris> that's incredible
[22:29:04] <jmercouris> thats 340kg for our metric friends
[22:30:00] <Kabouik> :Sure jmercouris, here it is: https://0x0.st/-Coe.lisp
[22:30:27] <jmercouris> Kabouik: give me a second to run that bad boy
[22:30:48] <Kabouik> Take your time, I'm happy that you even pick up my issue!
[22:31:16] <jmercouris> anything for you
[22:31:26] <jmercouris> you are an oasis in the desert
[22:31:29] <jmercouris> a star in the night sky
[22:31:29] <Kabouik> <heart with my hands>
[22:33:01] <jmercouris> I see the problem Kabouik
[22:33:07] <jmercouris> you didn't believe enough
[22:33:10] <Kabouik> That's good
[22:33:16] <Kabouik> I can buy the solution
[22:33:22] <Kabouik> Say a price
[22:33:43] <Kabouik> Unless it's !important.
[22:34:04] <jmercouris> give me a second
[22:34:07] <jmercouris> so here is what I did: (ffi-inspector-show (current-prompt-buffer))
[22:34:14] <jmercouris> and then I see that there is also a "suggestions" div
[22:34:17] <jmercouris> which has a background
[22:34:21] <jmercouris> which is why you are seeing the white
[22:34:30] <jmercouris> I'm testing the modification now
[22:34:54] <jmercouris> Kabouik: http://dpaste.com/4LKSXJMZG
[22:35:13] <Kabouik> ffi-inspector-show, that's the magical power I was missing
[22:35:17] <jmercouris> line 25 is where I made the change
[22:35:43] <Kabouik> Thanks, so I can remove L9 I guess
[22:35:57] <jmercouris> yes
[22:37:26] <jmercouris> mariari: it is showing the links for me, not downloading
[22:37:35] <mariari> really weird
[22:37:41] <mariari> wonder why it was doing it in my case
[22:37:50] <Kabouik> That's perfect, thanks. What I really needed was the trick to inspect Nyxt's own UI
[22:38:00] <jmercouris> Kabouik: indeed, you can use it for anything :-)
[22:38:01] <Kabouik> Pretty cool.
[22:38:15] <jmercouris> you know, the key difference
[22:38:16] <mariari> any idea why it's trying to download it jmercouris ?
[22:38:17] <jmercouris> it is always about belief
[22:38:25] <jmercouris> I think it is because you don't believe hard enough
[22:38:32] <jmercouris> otherwise, I have no inkling
[22:38:35] <jmercouris> something with mime types perhaps
[22:38:37] <mariari> hmm jmercouris https://pomf2.lain.la/f/z0kplthc.png
[22:38:43] <Kabouik> I am not a believer indeed
[22:38:48] <mariari> maybe that libsoup error?
[22:38:52] <Kabouik> But I do put a lot of trust in you
[22:39:03] <jmercouris> mariari: very possibly
[22:39:06] <Kabouik> I have an altar for the Nyxt devs.
[22:39:08] <jmercouris> we are now on the libsoup bug tracker 11
[22:39:13] <jmercouris> Kabouik: :-D
[22:45:06] <Kabouik> Actually, where do you put the ffi-inspector-show wizardry ? I tried in my init.lisp under (in-package :nyxt-user) but then the inspector still can't inspect the UI
[22:45:25] <Kabouik> Wait you probably did that with swank in a running instance of nyxt
[22:45:41] <Kabouik> I am not an emacs user so there's no swank for me, I'm sad
[22:46:02] <waleee> I think you're dependent on a running webkit-instance for ffi-inspector
[22:46:07] <jmercouris> mariari: https://i.imgur.com/nAkJniG.png
[22:46:17] <mariari> jmercouris: really weird
[22:46:21] <jmercouris> Kabouik: you can also just open the REPL
[22:46:22] <jmercouris> and do it
[22:46:23] <mariari> must be that lib soup thing
[22:46:42] <jmercouris> Kabouik: so just go into M-x `lisp-repl`
[22:46:44] <Kabouik> I don't know how to do that, but maybe waleee actually already investigated how to interface Nyxt with Kakoune?
[22:46:51] <jmercouris> Kabouik: then "(in-package :nyxt)"
[22:47:01] <jmercouris> Kabouik: then "(ffi-inspector-show ...)"
[22:47:14] <jmercouris> Kabouik: I'm saying you can do it from within Nyxt!
[22:47:19] <jmercouris> there is no need to use any external program!
[22:47:36] <jmercouris> I'm telling you, you need to believe
[22:47:39] <Kabouik> My nyxt is still too slow to replace my beloved terminal and editor!
[22:47:51] <Kabouik> (And I love terminals)
[22:47:56] <waleee> Kabouik: eehh :) you overestimate my kakoune usage
[22:48:19] <Kabouik> Damn, and I was counting on you for a kakoune keybind mode
[22:48:46] <jmercouris> Kabouik: https://i.imgur.com/PCRqsnb.png
[22:48:50] <Kabouik> We need to recruit a new kakoune user here, and then when he's hooked to Nyxt, we'll tell him there's a admission ritual and he needs to write the mode.
[22:49:07] <jmercouris> you need to open up a prompt buffer
[22:49:12] <jmercouris> then click back onto the RPEL buffer
[22:49:15] <Kabouik> Thanks, I ll play with that jmercouris
[22:49:16] <jmercouris> and run the command
[22:49:52] <jmercouris> no problem monsieur
[22:50:14] <waleee> Kabouik: ifreund in #kakoune, #river, #zig is into janet so I'd count on kakoune to get better for at least 1 lisp
[22:50:20] <Kabouik> Funny, the repl buffer is still white despite my dark theme, I would have assumed it was considered an internal buffer
[22:52:11] <waleee> he was talking about doing a layout generator in janet for river (his wayland compositor) so another side-effect might be a better wayland/wlroots wrapper
[22:52:21] <waleee> * for janet
[22:52:55] <Kabouik> ifreund seems to be very active in the #kakoune ecosystem too
[22:54:04] <Kabouik> He's always there answering when I have a silly question
[22:54:26] <Kabouik> Overall there are at least 4 or 5 people there always answering, it's a very welcoming channel, I thought
[22:54:49] <Kabouik> They don't really praise fruits, though. That's all I have to say.
[22:55:50] <Kabouik> I meant that against them, not against #nyxt.
[22:56:27] <jmercouris> of course
[22:56:29] <waleee> editors is serious business
[22:56:40] <jmercouris> I assumed no blaspheme would come from your mouth against the fruit of the day
[22:56:44] <jmercouris> such things are unthinkable
[22:57:32] <jmercouris> Kabouik: It is probably the same thing, there is most likely some layer that is being given a background color which is restricting things
[23:45:48] <Kabouik> Hum, seems I have other issues now that I updated Nyxt. switch-buffer followed by a character for fuzzy search = death of Nyxt
[23:46:32] <Kabouik> It's not my config apparently
