[04:48:44] <acdw> how do yall do meetings in org mode?
[04:49:02] <TRS-80> homerj: Maybe some export / copy and then sum them up with something like awk?  Although with table names and references you could maybe do this right in Org mode?
[04:49:46] <homerj> TRS-80: maybe, it's one of those things where I just end up making an "all" heading, looking at the data and then deleting it
[04:50:06] <TRS-80> yeah that's probably the easiest, honestly

[14:18:50] <xaltsc> Hey, is it normal that the default (or at least I think so, I haven't touch anything explicitely related to that) highlighting for Emacs Lisp is poor ? For instance, it doesn't highlight t (or highlights error in a quoted list, but if the highlight is keyword based, that's normal)

[15:05:14] <gnoo> what's the benefit of using (unless (null variable) ...) instead of (when variable ...) ?
[15:05:45] <wasamasa> obfuscation
[15:06:02] <wasamasa> (unless x ...) is the same as (when (not x) ...)
[15:06:17] <wasamasa> null is an alias for not
[15:06:27] <wasamasa> so it turns into (when (not (not variable)) ...)
[15:06:33] <wasamasa> which is the same as (when variable ...)

[15:56:31] <gnoo> which means, if you start emacs from a shell like bash where you've exported PATH, it will work for your usecase.

[23:39:35] <bremner> Of course it's subjective...
[23:39:59] <davidkrauser> technomancy: that's is very true. I think the mistake was that it took too long to open source, and by the time it was open sourced, the world had moved on. Then Canonical was annoyed they put in the effort to open source it just to have nobody use it
[23:40:22] <davidkrauser> But imagine if it was more of a community effort from the start?
[23:40:41] <davidkrauser> I think the original business was built around selling launchpad as a service of some kind, though, so I sort of understand the mindset
[23:41:11] <davidkrauser> And Ubuntu was just a demo of "Look what you can build with Launchpad! A whole Linux distro!"

[23:43:59] <davidkrauser> Ironically, Canonical doesn't want to open source the snap server back end, and they use the Launchpad open-sourcing effort as a primary reason why. They say that it's a lot of effort and nobody else will use it
[23:44:26] <Catie> I think that's about the worst reason not to open-source something I've ever heard
[23:45:36] <twb> "After I got rich running a CA cartel, I tried open source for a couple decades, but it wasn't a good way to extort money from people, so I've stopped doing that."
[23:48:57] <davidkrauser> I mean, the reasoning there isn't great, but I do appreciate a lot of what Canonical gives away for free. They have like 50+ kernel devs that just backport security fixes and such to all the kernels for the supported Ubuntus. And everything in the main repository gets regular security maintenance and review
[23:49:09] <davidkrauser> Whether you like snapd or not, they're a net positive for the Linux ecosystem
