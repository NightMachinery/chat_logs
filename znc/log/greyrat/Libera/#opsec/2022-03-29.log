[02:30:06] <Joanna> inky_: I didn’t do anything new to the channel I just have it registered users only to reduce the number of trolls. It has always been set up like this . Maybe libera staff might know more about technical difficulties connecting.
[02:32:20] <jessicara> yeah it will reduce that a bit
[02:32:44] <Joanna> It reduces it a lot :)
[02:33:06] <Joanna> I feel sorry for ops in #libera
[02:33:23] <jessicara> yeah, it gets out of hand whenever certain people emerge again
[02:34:03] <jessicara> i am increasingly annoyed at the security situation for general using a pc
[02:34:23] <jessicara> node-ipc and a discord token stealer elsewhere, both seemingly for different sides in the conflict
[02:35:02] <jessicara> individual coders making decisions to weaponize their existing trust is kinda wild
[02:35:28] <jessicara> makes me paranoid of packages, have multiple mirrors of distros at different versions now over this
[02:39:50] <Joanna> jessicara: I think a lot of the lgbt hatred is fueled by an agenda some people have to try to influence children about it. People don’t want their kids to become gay and not have any grandkids .
[02:41:41] <Joanna> A long time ago being gay was something people kept secret if they wanted to do it. They didn’t brag about it in public or try to convince people to do it.
[02:45:35] <Joanna> There are bioweapons labs all over the world trying to make more dangerous pathogens. The us likes to put them near/in countries it doesn’t like in case there is an accident. Of course this is very short sighted because an accident will spread everywhere like Black Plague did.
[02:51:19] <Joanna> I would like to know more about Putin’s childhood and parents.
[02:56:52] <elkclone> evening
[03:18:51] <jessicara> Joanna: well, very briefly, he grew up during the seige of leningrad. it was extremely hard to put it mild. he got in to judo and got interested in defending the motherland from the nazis for obvious and actually rather good reason
[03:19:11] <jessicara> that's extremely briefly the childhood
[03:38:05] <Joanna> Hi elkclone
[03:38:58] <Joanna> jessicara: he was born in 1952 that was after the war
[03:39:30] <Joanna> Oh the father you mean?
[03:40:01] <Joanna> According to Wikipedia the father was a conscript in navy
[03:40:25] <jessicara> yeah his father was
[03:40:54] <jessicara> there is differing stories about this time of his life too
[03:41:01] <Joanna> I’m not sure how accurate info on Wikipedia is
[03:41:20] <jessicara> at the very least, it was difficult, and would still be difficult after the war
[03:57:58] *** Roey is now known as WontSmith
[04:17:30] <Joanna> I don’t like the way western media gives no details about anything hardly. When there is an article about a serial killer all they talk about is where they went to school and that’s it. They don’t give any details about anything that happened during their childhood really.
[04:18:59] <Joanna> It’s all a big mystery about someone just deciding to become evil for absolutely no reason whatsoever..

[17:56:45] <jessicara> as for sewage farming, yes it can potentially be safe
[17:57:01] <jessicara> but no, people don't comply with basic safety rules when money is at stake
[17:59:11] *** Joins: s1gyn (~s1gyn@user/s1gyn)
[17:59:44] <Joanna> People in India are too poor to be squeamish. The sewage farming solves the lack of water treatment, fertilizer and water scarcity all at once
[18:00:24] <Joanna> It seems like a great low energy solution. I’m sure sewage treatment takes a lot of energy
[18:01:17] <Joanna> jessicara: I think it isn’t so good for places where it rains a lot though

[19:33:19] <norayr> but still, i like it very much to have the gateway.
[19:33:37] <norayr> first of all, my ip does not get known to libera. or anyone.
[19:33:57] <norayr> secondly i have only one account. i like having one identity and being represented everywhere with one identity.
[19:34:10] <norayr> that's about the decentralization.
