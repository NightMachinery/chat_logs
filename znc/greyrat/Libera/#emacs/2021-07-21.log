[02:24:43] <incal> o/ I've been doing CL with SLIME and I wonder how it is suppose to be done with two files and one file refers to the other and uses stuff in that other file, in Elisp one would do `provide' ... `require' and byte-compile, here I found `load' but when I do `slime-eval-last-expression' on the `load' lines it says "file does not exist" (but it does, in the same dir) so either there is a path issue _or_ that's not the way to do it in CL,
[02:24:44] <incal> right? or am I wrong? TIA

[02:25:23] <wasamasa> instead you have a callback doing non-blocking things and now you're in a different context than the original thing
[02:25:40] <technomancy> async doesn't have to be callback soup
[02:25:42] <wasamasa> so you have to think hard how to communicate the result of that back to the function you kicked it off in
[02:25:53] <wasamasa> in elisp it is
[02:25:58] <wasamasa> that's how much it mirrors early JS
[02:26:20] <wasamasa> JS people did so much callback soup they eventually figured out how to do better, but that wisdom has yet to reach the elisp people
[02:26:25] <technomancy> right but that's the whole reason it was brought up
[02:26:38] <technomancy> it's possible to have good async APIs; it would be a big improvement to emacs
[02:26:52] <wasamasa> is generator.el a good async API?
[02:27:14] <aidalgol> The obvious answer is to implement ReactiveX in elisp.
[02:27:16] * aidalgol hides
[02:27:17] <acdw> wasamasa: no, i've just heard non-blocking stuff is important
[02:27:22] <technomancy> I haven't used it. all I know is it's kinda like coroutines but not quite as good.
[02:27:32] <technomancy> I just don't know *how* not as good
[02:27:37] <wasamasa> it's not obvious to me whether it even achieves that goal
[02:27:50] <technomancy> it's frustrating because like ... why make it worse? the good design is like ... *right there*
[02:27:57] <technomancy> you own the runtime; you own the compiler.

[02:30:30] <wasamasa> *sane
[02:31:18] <quotemstr> So why don't people use generators more for async?
[02:31:26] <wasamasa> I have no idea how
[02:31:30] <quotemstr> IMHO, the answer is threads 
[02:31:40] <wasamasa> it's not obvious to me how they're equivalent to promises
[02:31:46] <quotemstr> If you go with callback soup, you "discover" async/await functions

[02:32:19] <wasamasa> uhuh
[02:32:28] <quotemstr> Then you move to lightweight threads, as in Go, Erlang, and soon Java
[02:32:39] <quotemstr> https://openjdk.java.net/projects/loom/
[02:32:51] <wasamasa> what use are threads if we don't even have thread communication, lol
[02:32:58] <quotemstr> wasamasa: Wait. Is generators.el an example of something good or something that sucks?
[02:33:09] <wasamasa> other than thread mutexes
[02:33:25] <wasamasa> it's an example of something that doesn't look like it helps me at all
[02:33:37] <wasamasa> cool code and everything, but I'm not convinced it's worth using for my needs
[02:34:06] <wasamasa> I need a sword, not a trebuchet
[02:35:05] <quotemstr> Ah
[02:35:11] <quotemstr> See, the problem with generators is, well, a few things
[02:35:23] <quotemstr> 1) they're hard to debug --- edebug doesn't work at all; you're reduced to message
[02:35:27] <wasamasa> generators look to me like the tool to implement lazy sequences with and end up with something like itertools or ruby's iterable
[02:35:29] <quotemstr> 2) they're not blazing fast
[02:35:34] <quotemstr> 3) there's no async IO layer on top of them
[02:35:46] <quotemstr> If you look at the history of Python AIO, it started out as a layer on top of generators 
[02:35:50] <quotemstr> I was hoping we'd grow something similar

[05:13:01] <gig> i think google has kinda been the driver on the android rcs front since the carriers have been dragging their collective asses for so long
[05:13:10] <bpalmer> if carriers support RCS, they can offer fancy chat features without consumers doing stuff on third party apps
[05:13:15] <twb> That does not mean "you pay AT&T $1/sms" that means "AT&T sells information about you bsaed on your SMSs"
[05:13:20] <bpalmer> whatsapp and wechat are supposed to be huge in many markets.
[05:13:57] <bpalmer> twb: no; that means "AT&T charges businesses to do mass RCS" or offer "shortcodes" or suchlike

[05:15:24] <bpalmer> twb: On SMS and RCS, the money would go to the carrier (like AT&T). If the businesses are doing it on a chat app (like whatsapp), the money goes to the chat app owner (like facebook)
[05:16:06] <bpalmer> twb: google's like the one thing that doesn't offer much in this space, because its chat products aren't big on business-to-consumer relations

[05:21:04] <bpalmer> "... RCS is still preferable to carriers as it will give them the opportunity to sell RCS services to businesses. The GSMA estimates that will be a $74 billion market by 2021." (from a 2018 article in the verge)

[08:13:48] <aidalgol> Oh, he meant what is AIX's equivalent called.
[08:15:08] <kakuhen> launchd is pretty cool and I wish the FreeBSD port stayed alive after they got it working back around '07 or so
[08:15:22] <turbofail> is systemd the kleenex of inits now?
[08:16:26] <kakuhen> with launchd you can set up a service that stays alive provided that it crashed and you're connected to a network and another job is running, and add a bunch of other constraints that idk the systemd-equivalents for
[08:16:29] <mixfix41> make wpa_supplicant you have to use systemctl

[14:39:11] <rnkn> it seems that the ms macro package has a hardcoded .PP paragraph width/indent

[14:44:52] <twb> lisp123: that sounds... extremely not good
[14:45:13] <lisp123> twb: yeah it is written in JS..I don't use it anymore because its a bit too much of a hack, but it achieves the job reasonably well
[14:45:30] <twb> lisp123: does it support opentype features at all?
[14:45:31] <rnkn> I'd like to be able to write markdown and use lowdown(1) to make PDFs
[14:45:34] <twb> lisp123: I *need* dlig
[14:45:48] <lisp123> twb: it relies on the browser's rendering engine, so its only a minor hack to be fair

[14:46:13] <twb> lisp123: pandoc just runs latex
[14:46:29] <lisp123> it can't accept markdown?
[14:47:02] <rnkn> pandoc can't be compiled on arm64
[14:47:03] <twb> lisp123: pandoc can convert markdown to pdf, but it does so via md->tex and then tex->pdf

[14:47:24] <lisp123> twb: thanks for that
[14:47:41] <twb> rnkn: pandoc/arm64 exists on debian
[14:47:54] <twb> rnkn: presumably they cross-compile it or use haskell->c and then gcc
[14:48:31] <lisp123> As a final comment from me, a reasonable way (IMO) is to convert markdown to html and then html to pdf
[14:48:46] <lisp123> using a headless chrome, but that might get a bit too complex for people
[14:48:54] <twb> lisp123: that's what I was suggesting with md--markdown->html and then html--pandoc-->pdf
[14:49:08] <twb> Because chrome is like 200MB
[14:49:11] <twb> and awful
[14:49:13] <lisp123> twb: sorry I jumped into the thread late :-)
[14:49:17] <twb> lisp123: no worries
[14:49:46] <rnkn> in theory groff should be the most lightweight Unix-y way
[14:50:03] <twb> prince is only 7MB
[14:50:16] <rnkn> I mean, the output PDF is fine, the text is just a little too wide for my tastes
[14:50:19] <lisp123> prince you have to pay for
[14:50:21] <twb> rnkn: on what do you base that theory?
[14:50:32] <lisp123> otherweise, yes its amazing
[14:50:40] <twb> lisp123: yeah but rnkn already said they're using MacOS and hate GPL3
[14:50:55] <twb> lisp123: so I assume they're OK with shareware-ish stuff

[14:52:44] <twb> I really like that I can upgrade images from thumbnails to SVGs

[14:53:09] <twb> img[data-lazy-src]{content:attr("data-lazy-src",url);display:block;}
[14:53:23] <lisp123> so much easier to follow than the the alternative html to pdf tools (all that said, Paged.JS is actually pretty good too - the only issue is that wrecks your source code by placing it into many of its own DOM elements)

[14:56:42] <lisp123> I assume there is a good markdown to html converted in Emacs? I wrote my own for something else, but if it hasn't been done, I should probably fix mine up and publish it
[14:56:44] <twb> I just noticed that prince has 14.x and supports calc() since Feb
[14:56:52] <twb> I haven't updated since Jan since it's not in Debian >_<
[14:57:04] <twb> lisp123: markdown to html is just called markdown(1)
[14:57:18] <twb> lisp123: markdown is a SHIT design and ONLY supports html as first-class export
[14:57:47] <twb> lisp123: it's basically a "look mum I made a wiki" 6 lines of s/// replacements, and everything beyond that is non-portable extensions
[14:57:53] <lisp123> twb: yeah I really don't like markdown for many reasons, unfortunately it has become de facto
[14:57:57] <twb> lisp123: you should use reST if you care about PDF output at all
[14:58:06] <twb> reST is the standard chosen by Linux kernel and Python

[18:22:55] <vhallac> irek: I've done just that
[18:23:10] <vhallac> It is OK for simple stuff, but it feels wrong
[18:23:45] <twb> vhallac: I saw someone solve that with vim, but not emacs.  I use ed also.
[18:24:00] <twb> vhallac: for the specific case of "git over tramp", magit might handle it.  vc.el also handles it for simple cases.
[18:24:24] <vhallac> vc.el worked fine the other day. It does require a bit of patience sometimes, though
[18:24:49] <twb> As for crontabs, don't use crontab -e
[18:24:57] <vhallac> It is not as bad as it used to be. I am switching my workflow to be dired centric
[18:24:57] <twb> That stores jobs in /var which is not normally version controlled
[18:25:35] <twb> If you're a sysadmin use /etc/cron.* or /etc/systemd/system/*.timer and if you're an end user use ~/.local/systemd/user/*.timer
[18:25:35] <vhallac> What do you do for user cron jobs?
[18:25:51] <twb> Or I guess version-control /var/spool/cron but meh.
[18:26:23] <twb> vixie cron is a heap of shit for many reasons, and chronic(1) only fixes a few
[18:26:58] <vhallac> I am switching to a local kubernetes. That will solve a lot of problems, and introduce a lot more. :D
[18:27:19] <vhallac> But at least I won't need "crontab -e" as normal user anymore
[18:27:21] <twb> introduce more is right
[18:27:44] <twb> I've been doing ~/.local/systemd/user/*.timer for a while as an end user and it's been FineTM
[18:27:57] <twb> good enough for stuff like "every 10 minutes ask what task I'm working on"
[18:28:39] <twb> Make that .config/systemd/user/backup-crontab.timer

[18:55:56] <grym> xheimlic1: (geek dad here). despite how hard self-care is in the first months of having a kid, it is extremely important
[18:56:37] <grym> xheimlic1: i mean, yogurt's great.  but ya boi the foam roller will reduce DOMS more, and so will general core strength work.  Hupping a kid is very lopsided effort and you don't want that to dominate

[18:57:39] <xheimlic1> I had wrist aches for a long while in my late 20s to early 30s.
[18:58:36] <xheimlic1> Used to wear those orthotic wrist bracelet velcro things. A girl once told me they looked like something a rock drummer would wear so it was kind of hot, so I didn't even feel self-conscious about.
[18:58:39] <grym> i don't and i know why 
[18:58:54] <xheimlic1> What they did was, I learned to use a muscle in my forearm I wasn't previously aware of.

[19:00:44] <xheimlic1> I carried that "learning" to the baby. I don't know how, but I managed to force the backpack muscles way more than my spinal support. Which is good, they get stronger.
[19:01:06] <grym> rather a lot of baby carrying is abs/lats

[19:05:21] <xheimlic1> yeah. I don't know what's common here, but kid spent two weeks in the NICU and they did so many tests on him I still haven't finished reading them.
[19:05:48] <xheimlic1> Including a physical hearing test that's not behavioral, they measure something something nerve or brain something.
[19:05:52] <grym> ABR
[19:06:13] <grym> (auditory brainstem response)
[19:06:42] <grym> you can also measure DPOAEs in an unobstructed ear (distortion product otoacoustic emissions)

[21:31:19] <Bayes> but it still resolves to 70, which is the default value
[21:31:51] <bremner> what do you mean by "width of line" ? after fill-paragraph?
[21:32:19] <Bayes> yeah, I want it to be at 120 but it defaults to 't' which is 70
[21:32:43] <Bayes> sorry not the width of the line but the number of chars at which the line is printed
[21:32:44] <bremner> try C-x f

[21:33:43] <Bayes> bremner https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Displaying-Boundaries.html
[21:34:19] <Bayes> according to the manual, display-fill-column-indicator-column controls the column number where the indicator should be set
[21:34:29] <bremner> are you in the right minor-mode?
[21:34:57] <Bayes> well I see the line
[21:35:02] <Bayes> so I'm guessing I am ?
[21:35:03] <bremner> ok
[21:35:06] <bpalmer> Bayes: right. But the indicator does not control where the lines will be filled.
[21:35:37] <bpalmer> Bayes: are you typing a line that is more than 70 characters and being annoyed when suddenly a newline is inserted?
[21:36:21] <Bayes> bpalmer no :(  I just want the vertical line to be drawn at 80 instead of 70 chars

[21:36:52] <grift> its probaby the other way around, if you set the fill column than that indicator will probably adjust to that. so if you set-fill-column 80 then the indicator might adjust to that (at least in my experience)
[21:36:58] <bremner> Bayes: it's not just you, it seems the same here
[21:37:29] <bpalmer> Bayes: ok. The other issue is that display-fill-column-indicator-column is a buffer local variable

[21:38:12] <bpalmer> You can try (setq-default display-fill-column-indicator-column 80) in your .emacs , to change the default value instead.

[23:37:03] <quippy> yeah, but when I start a new compilation process it moves point back to the top and I have to move it to the end again
[23:37:16] <quippy> so really I'm asking: how do I get it to move to the very end, automatically, when a new compilation starts?
[23:37:28] <bpalmer> quippy: I think the classic compiled languages like C really encourage people to only fix the first few errors and try compiling again
[23:37:50] <quippy> yeah I just use M-x compile to launch all kinds of things and I want to watch the bottom of the output most of the time
[23:38:04] <quippy> like right now I'm running `make` and then some docker builds through it
[23:38:08] <bpalmer> quippy: add something to compilation-start-hook
[23:38:32] <quippy> yeah it's actually the "something" that I'm not sure about, I guess I can look at C-h f to see what commands I'm running manually
[23:38:43] <quippy> I was hoping that the compilation mode had a flag
[23:38:45] <bpalmer> quippy: there's also compilation-filter-hook which is run more often (whenever anything is output in the compilation buffer), so you can have more control
[23:39:00] <quippy> oh interesting, well that's very helpful, thanks
[23:39:46] <bpalmer> quippy: C-h k M->   shows that it runs end-of-buffer  , to move point to the end of the buffer. Ignoring what it says about doing things in lisp code, you could simply do (add-hook 'compilation-start-hook 'end-of-buffer)
