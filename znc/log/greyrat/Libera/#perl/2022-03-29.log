[06:57:42] <aquanight> basically - what to do about :Pure subs calls found after a previous parsing error. Currently I basically just ignore the purecall entirely (because if I try to inline it things get fuckshaped fast because somehow I get an invalid context)
[06:58:18] <aquanight> but I'm wondering if I should do like perl core does and force-raise a "BEGIN not safe after errors" type of error

[15:17:32] *** Joins: jpn (~jpn@user/jpn)
[15:18:55] <tm604> LeoNerd: yes, that's easy enough to set up
[15:19:03] <tm604> first, you'll need to install kubernetes, containerd and Træfik as an ingress controller.
[15:19:09] <tm604> Build an image for the .psgi app, making sure not to run into glibc compatibility issues.
[15:19:22] <tm604> Next, create statefulset pods for each web server you want, and assign k8s tags for the desired hostname (can be localhost) and path. magic: everything exposed through port 80 and/or :443
[15:19:30] <LeoNerd> Mmm. ;) So I'll tell you my existing solution, what's wrong with it, and the ideal shape of my new one
[15:19:31] *** Joins: emanuele6 (~emanuele6@user/emanuele6)
[15:19:33] <tm604> oh, you'll need to learn TOML of course
[15:20:24] <LeoNerd> My existing one, I created a local user (useradd), I invented a TCP port number (8035). I run the app as that user with an `@reboot` cron entry to ensure it starts the startup script, `nohup plackup ...` with the TCP port number embedded in it. The lightty config then directs the hostname onto that local responder
[15:20:26] <tm604> or if you want to make it _more_ visible, let ngrok.io do all the work (and the rest of the world get to try it out as well)
[15:20:48] <LeoNerd> I dislike it for the lack of process management (because `@reboot` in cron is terrible), and I dislike it immensely for that having to manage the TCP port number
[15:21:13] <LeoNerd> I would _love_ to say "Hey, lightty, this hostname is that fastcgi script over there" and that's it. No UID, no TCP port number. It would just work
[15:21:39] <tm604> Is the hostname something arbitrary, or literally just the one-of-a-kind hostname(1) on that server?
[15:21:52] <LeoNerd> It's a named subdomain of leonerd.org.uk. Entirely fixed
[15:22:28] <LeoNerd> Oh and ZWS was doing this kind of thing back in 1998 so I know it to be entirely technically possible
[15:22:53] <LeoNerd> I just don't know if someone has taken the time to write the code for a lightty mod to make it actually happen
[15:24:27] <tm604> hmm - normally I use https://caddyserver.com/ and some module I found on CPAN for serving HTTP, poke the config mapping at it once I have a listening port

[18:50:25] <ash_worksi> can I use ARGV in a oneline like this? `perl -e '...' arg`

[18:50:45] <ash_worksi> (interpreted as a file)
[18:51:04] <Altreus> No you need something that gives you while(<>) for it to be interpreted as a file

[18:51:14] <simcop2387> ash_worksi: yea, the ARGV file handle is the way to do that.  so while(<ARGV>) { ... }.  you can also use while(<>) { ... } which will also handle stdin if there's no argvb

[20:35:35] <sokan> xenu: that went to me?
[20:35:51] <xenu> no, that was me failing to change a window
[20:35:53] <xenu> but anyway
[20:35:56] <sokan> lol
[20:36:01] <xenu> let's start with the basics
[20:36:43] <xenu> 1. it isn't 1994 anymore, which means you're supposed to add "use strict" to your script add declare all variables with "my", e.g. my $count = 0;
[20:37:08] <xenu> 2. print "foo\n"; is a better way to print with a newline than print "foo<line break>"
[20:37:16] <xenu> and to answer your question
[20:37:51] <sokan> Ok. 1) I wasn't told by our prof about that. Will change it. 2) Will change as well
[20:37:58] <xenu> obviously if you want to match something more than once, you need a loop
[20:38:51] *** Joins: FlorianBad (~FlorianBa@cpe-67-49-107-16.dc.res.rr.com)
[20:38:52] <xenu> for example
[20:39:12] *** Parts: sniff (sid387688@id-387688.hampstead.irccloud.com) ()
[20:39:46] <xenu> if you replace 'if ($seq =~ m/N[^P][ST][^P]/)' with 'while ($seq =~ m/N[^P][ST][^P]/g) { ... }' that code will be executed for each match

[20:42:05] <sokan> xenu: :o It actually worked!
[20:42:10] <sokan> My only issue now is count
[20:42:27] <sokan> It should reset after each "name"
[20:43:01] <sokan> got it!
[20:43:15] <sokan> I $count = 0; outside of the while loop

[20:43:22] <sokan> xenu: many many thanks :D
[20:44:25] <xenu> i actually didn't say what 'use strict' is for
[20:44:47] <xenu> it helps you to catch misspelled variables, which means it makes programming easier
[20:45:14] <xenu> for example: use strict: my $foo; print $fooo; # error
[20:45:21] <xenu> without "use strict" perl would've quietly printed nothing
[20:46:54] <xenu> my $foo; $fooo = 1; is an even better example because 'use warnings' won't catch it

[20:48:47] <sokan> I don't get what you say at 2. 
[20:49:05] <xenu> "at 2."?
[20:49:27] <sokan> and my $foo declares only foo so if I by mistake use $fooo it'll catch it as mistake, right?
[20:49:34] <xenu> yes
[20:49:44] <sokan> "print "foo\n"; is a better way to print with a newline than print "foo<line break>""
[20:50:38] <sokan> ^ This I didn't quite get. The <line break> part

[20:52:59] <xenu> \n has the same effect as a literal line break (what the enter key does), but it communicates your intent more clearly and doesn't break your indentation
[20:53:04] <xenu> also it's easier to copy and paste
[20:53:17] <sokan> oooh I see

[20:54:50] <sokan> the "; bellow I have no idea why occurs
[20:55:51] <sokan> I use a cli tool to upload on dpaste but somehow it recognises \n as newline and enters a newline
