[05:01:21] <ButterNoodle> I'm typing real hard and breathing through my neck beard on a unsolvable problem :|
[05:01:24] <ButterNoodle> naaa
[05:01:27] <MootPoot> np
[05:01:28] <ButterNoodle> I havent had it out
[05:01:30] <MootPoot> you can get back to that
[05:01:32] <ButterNoodle> I need to get glass for it
[05:01:34] <MootPoot> I wont annoy you
[05:01:36] <MootPoot> wha-
[05:01:42] <MootPoot> I thought you bought old nikon glass
[05:01:46] <MootPoot> u were askin
[05:01:50] <ButterNoodle> I have that on my AR
[05:02:07] <ButterNoodle> that xbolt deserves a leopold
[05:02:18] <ButterNoodle> *gotta wait on my bonus for that
[05:02:49] <ButterNoodle> plus I'm not in a rush to get it out
[05:02:51] <MootPoot> does it really matter anyway? aside from like super long range clarity it seems like they all perform the same...I guess unless you're some kind of competition shooter
[05:02:55] <ButterNoodle> have no ammo for it
[05:03:06] <MootPoot> cant buy or too lazy to reload?
[05:03:37] <ButterNoodle> cant reload either.. no 300 winmag brass to be found, I do have large magnum primers from the 500 tho
[05:03:44] <ButterNoodle> *to lazy to look for brass
[05:04:01] <ButterNoodle> plus rifle powder is non existent
[05:04:26] <MootPoot> buy some 223 and pull the bullets
[05:04:28] <MootPoot> go full monke
[05:05:03] <ButterNoodle> leopold glass is by far better than the nikon stuff.. but dollar for dollar you get what u pay for in optics
[05:05:08] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: I guess in a rare caliber like that you're fucked since the only place its common is the US..
[05:05:09] <ButterNoodle> I need something that wont fog up
[05:05:27] <ButterNoodle> ye here.. 300 win mag has been a staple for 40 years
[05:05:32] <ButterNoodle> 35??
[05:05:36] <ButterNoodle> idk its been a while
[05:05:49] <MootPoot> for other oddities here I can just get it from privi partizan
[05:06:00] <MootPoot> they still make fuckin carcano ammo
[05:06:07] <MootPoot> 6.5mm something
[05:06:19] <ButterNoodle> I mean if I wasnt in the USA, I'd opt for 30-06 otherwise
[05:06:30] <ButterNoodle> there is a bunch of that in production
[05:06:44] <ButterNoodle> its.. kinda nato???
[05:06:50] <MootPoot> ruski steel case 30-06 and 308 is pretty easy to come by here
[05:06:55] <MootPoot> american brass ones...not so much
[05:07:02] <MootPoot> cabelas brand herters is okay
[05:07:17] <ButterNoodle> herters... I've had one failure
[05:07:25] <ButterNoodle> 9mm failed to pop
[05:07:29] <MootPoot> herters 22lr is garbage though
[05:07:34] <MootPoot> HARD PASS
[05:07:45] <ButterNoodle> I should have brought it back and pulled it to see if they just didnt charge it, or bad primer
[05:07:45] <MootPoot> the only other 22lr that is that bad is winchester
[05:07:51] <ButterNoodle> lol
[05:08:01] <ButterNoodle> the bronze bucket isnt bad
[05:08:17] <MootPoot> not shaped correctly, dents, brass shavings
[05:08:19] <ButterNoodle> it really depends on what ur shooting it out of tho
[05:08:29] <ButterNoodle> 10/22's dont give a shit
[05:08:37] * MootPoot dosen't have a 10/22
[05:08:40] <ButterNoodle> a proper target rifle..

[05:26:40] <JesseDesu> gen z makes up crazy ambigious words
[05:26:45] <JesseDesu> wtf is cheugy
[05:27:24] <JesseDesu> feels like 7:30pm but its not even 6 yet
[05:27:41] <MootPoot> my hand is cramped from holding a mouse all day long
[05:28:05] <mixfix41> pass 7:30 you seven thirty (you crazy)
[05:28:21] <JesseDesu> i get rsi when i bend over to do quality checks on mail containers at work
[05:28:32] <MootPoot> why do you bend over
[05:28:33] <JesseDesu> never my hand tho
[05:28:35] <MootPoot> to take it up the rear
[05:28:41] <MootPoot> squat instead
[05:28:42] <JesseDesu> the container is waist high
[05:28:49] <JesseDesu> its a box or wire container
[05:28:50] <mixfix41> you need to pinch a tiddlewink
[05:28:51] <MootPoot> keep ur back straight
[05:29:03] <JesseDesu> i have a grabber tool
[05:29:23] <mixfix41> !c tiddlewink
[05:29:24] <ImoutoBot> mixfix41: Tiddlywinks is a game played on a flat felt mat with sets of small discs called "winks", a pot, which is the target, and a collection of squidgers, which are also discs.
[05:29:30] <JesseDesu> i remember that game
[05:29:33] <mixfix41> !c tiddlewink baby
[05:29:34] <ImoutoBot> mixfix41: I don't know.
[05:29:39] <ButterNoodle> tiddywinks
[05:29:41] <JesseDesu> i also remember hungry hungry hippos
[05:29:48] <JesseDesu> battleship
[05:29:50] <JesseDesu> who
[05:29:55] <JesseDesu> the game
[05:30:33] <JesseDesu> i'm gonna draw sailor saturn
[05:30:49] <JesseDesu> !seen amigojapan
[05:30:49] <ImoutoBot> JesseDesu: amigojapan was last seen in ##anime 3 hours and 6 minutes ago: <amigojapan> So he could not wait
[05:30:51] <mixfix41> chaunncey dolls suffice too
[05:30:59] <mixfix41> !c chauncey doll
[05:31:00] <ImoutoBot> mixfix41: I don't know.
[05:31:08] <MootPoot> hungry but I dont want to eat...
[05:31:25] <JesseDesu> butternoodle i bought a 600$ iwata air compressor and $250 airbrush also iwata
[05:31:32] <JesseDesu> its coming in the mail in a week
[05:31:51] <ButterNoodle> nice
[05:32:17] <JesseDesu> i love the feel of a good airbrush that can do thin lines without spitting or sputtering intermittantly
[05:32:33] <JesseDesu> it feels like drawing with charcoal
[05:32:54] <MootPoot> afk - gonna beat saber
[05:33:00] <JesseDesu> i can market myself
[05:33:02] <mixfix41> you know i mix acrylic paint good quality and mix with mod podge and use little spray botttle to spray backgrounds
[05:33:16] <mixfix41> its kinda cool
[05:33:23] <JesseDesu> theres not a lot of competition in the airbrush art buying market because hardly anyone does it
[05:33:45] <JesseDesu> so i think i might be in a good position
[05:33:59] <JesseDesu> digital artists are a dime a dozen
[05:34:21] <JesseDesu> how many of them know how to operate a real airbrush
[05:34:26] <JesseDesu> probably like 1%
[05:34:55] <mixfix41> you hook it up with a air tank 
[05:35:01] <JesseDesu> yes
[05:35:05] <mixfix41> haha its loud
[05:35:14] <JesseDesu> compressor and tank combo
[05:35:31] <JesseDesu> the one i bought has double for 2 airbrushes
[05:35:40] <JesseDesu> seperate air pressure can be set for both
[05:36:09] <JesseDesu> so like, you can work with 1 black and 1 white 
[05:36:15] <JesseDesu> or w/e
[05:36:30] <JesseDesu> mixfix what is this acrylic paint for
[05:36:46] <mixfix41> nothing really i took the idea from a video 
[05:37:07] <JesseDesu> i dont mix my own paint
[05:37:22] <JesseDesu> from scratch i mean
[05:37:22] <mixfix41> yea it tendds to clog the spray bottles sometimes not the best way
[05:37:27] <JesseDesu> with pigments
[05:38:34] <mixfix41> the amount of viewers that watch vtuber to the ones that watch interesting artist is disproportional 
[05:38:44] <mixfix41> vtubers arent as interesting as art streams
[05:39:01] <mixfix41> yet they are more popular
[05:39:09] <mixfix41> something radical will occur
[05:39:16] <JesseDesu> watching other artists makes me cringe
[05:39:23] <mixfix41> i dont know about that
[05:39:26] <JesseDesu> if they're average its boring and cringy
[05:39:39] <JesseDesu> if they are amazing i get jealous
[05:39:45] <mixfix41> no im talking inviting like expert and welcoming to teach and drawing on stream
[05:39:50] <JesseDesu> so overall i try not to watch other artists
[05:39:58] <JesseDesu> lol
[05:40:09] <mixfix41> carsondrewit he welcomes any artist share their artwork
[05:40:20] <mixfix41> yeah i cringe too if artist dont do that
[05:40:36] <mixfix41> even nsfw lewds
[05:41:10] <JesseDesu> i judge other artists
[05:41:12] <mixfix41> but like im saying its just peculiar cause some art streams have got that vtuber addiction that has been undiscover
[05:41:13] <JesseDesu> brutally
[05:41:15] <JesseDesu> in my head
[05:41:39] <JesseDesu> i dont say it out loud ofc
[05:42:17] <mixfix41> thats your technique then

[06:25:47] <JesseDesu> i've seen some strong flies
[06:25:53] <Poeticode> read some good news about covid for a change today https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/p/there-is-good-news
[06:25:53] <ImoutoBot> [title] There is good news - by Katelyn Jetelina
[06:25:57] <JesseDesu> i spray raid on them and they keep flying
[06:26:02] <mixfix41> one grandma pass before christmas her card playing friend was hiding her dianosis
[06:26:44] <isekaijin> I'm waiting my turn for the third shot, but the way people behave outside (sometimes including the vaccination personnel!) isn't very reassuring.
[06:26:45] <Poeticode> main takeaway is that vaccines work really well even 2 years later into the pandemic, regular masks prevent transmission by 50%+, and N95's by like 95%
[06:27:01] <MootPoot> I wanna wear a mask forever
[06:27:07] <MootPoot> I just wish it didnt fog up my glasses
[06:27:38] <Poeticode> hm a properly fitted N95 shouldn't fog up
[06:27:54] <MootPoot> yeah - how do I get one
[06:28:07] <MootPoot> only shitty cloth ones and those paper fiber whatever ones here
[06:28:17] <Poeticode> nowadays they're easy to order online at least in the states
[06:29:00] <Poeticode> hardware stores might be a good option too
[06:31:25] <ButterNoodle> just wear a gas mask and pipe in ur butt vapors
[06:31:59] <MootPoot> unironically - I'd rather wear a motorcycle helmet every time
[06:32:10] <MootPoot> rather then a fucking mask that eventually makes me blind
[06:34:13] <ButterNoodle> just wear a spit mask
[06:35:08] <MootPoot> lol
[06:35:11] <MootPoot> those useless things
[06:37:03] <MootPoot> wtf?
[06:38:39] <MootPoot> ?????????
[06:38:42] <MootPoot> why....
[06:38:59] <MootPoot> my NAS box keeps shutting iteself down randomly 
[06:39:29] <MootPoot> however.... the PC says power got yanked
[06:39:31] <MootPoot> wtf?
[06:39:49] <MootPoot> I think my ups for my router clicked or something as well
[06:39:56] <MootPoot> since I heard two clicks
[06:40:08] <MootPoot> and one was from the other side of the room....
[06:40:22] <MootPoot> sudden brownout causing the psu to trigger off?
[06:40:56] <MootPoot> but my main PC is fine....
[06:43:08] <JesseDesu> CumPooters
[06:45:44] <mixfix41> its probs the psu 
[06:46:04] <mixfix41> if its rated and everything.. it may be defective its only my guess tho..
[06:51:07] <MootPoot> the psu on the other side of the room trips for a second too - I'm guessing its a mild fluction causing it - it then goes through the PSU and it turns off
[06:51:18] <MootPoot> through the surge protector*
[06:51:51] <MootPoot> okay, well. that didnt fix shit
[06:52:00] <MootPoot> fuck it

[06:58:51] <JesseDesu> looks delish
[06:59:21] <mixfix41> keto kinda looks like a travesty. i never knew why people did those bunless burgers and roast sandwiches
[06:59:29] <JesseDesu> does your phone camera have food filters
[06:59:32] <Satin> no
[06:59:40] <Satin> it might but i haven't checked it
[06:59:45] <MootPoot> ok, well - it seems like the NAS  didnt instantly turn off
[06:59:48] <Satin> I only used the "enhance" one
[06:59:55] <Satin> MootPoot: now what are you fighting with
[06:59:56] <MootPoot> I guess it was the surge protector or something
[07:00:02] <JesseDesu> enchancement under the sea
[07:00:14] <JesseDesu> i was listening to doo wop music on youtube last night
[07:00:20] <Satin> mixfix41: Idk about you but I think msot people have unhealthy eating habits
[07:00:23] <MootPoot> Satin: some kind of brownout or something was making both my UPS and NAS PSU cut power
[07:00:32] <Satin> keto at the very least helps reset that
[07:00:36] <tcsilver> I listen to do wop too :D
[07:00:40] <MootPoot> I took a keto pregnancy test
[07:00:41] <tcsilver> do wop shoo bee doo !
[07:00:42] <MootPoot> I am not in keto
[07:00:44] <MootPoot> apparently

[07:00:48] <Satin> L
[07:00:54] <tcsilver> lol
[07:01:00] <Satin>  but you're still losing weight yeah?
[07:01:01] <mixfix41> well given its kinda risky to excercise in public its a good option
[07:01:08] <Satin> mixfix41: wdym risky
[07:01:16] <MootPoot> nah I've plateued off for a while - 
[07:01:18] <Satin> mixfix41: excercise does not compensate for bad diet
[07:01:22] <MootPoot> I had a pizza on the 1st
[07:01:28] <Satin> MootPoot: ...
[07:01:31] <MootPoot> probs will take a while to get back into it
[07:01:36] <MootPoot> carb cycling and all
[07:01:41] <Satin> MootPoot: how much pizza
[07:01:47] <MootPoot> enough
[07:01:53] <Satin> 10 slices
[07:01:58] <MootPoot> probs
[07:02:03] <MootPoot> idk
[07:02:03] * Satin ...
[07:02:06] <Satin> MootPoot: bad.
[07:02:08] <MootPoot> 8/10 of a whole large
[07:02:10] <MootPoot> pan
[07:02:13] <Satin> bad
[07:02:17] <MootPoot> listen
[07:02:18] <MootPoot> carb
[07:02:19] <MootPoot> cycle
[07:02:20] <MootPoot> ok
[07:02:21] <Satin> ofc that'll kick you out
[07:02:25] <mixfix41> it depends tho
[07:02:29] <Satin> MootPoot: no, that'll just add to ur weight
[07:02:32] <Satin> outside of keto
[07:02:35] <Satin> why 8/10
[07:02:38] <Satin> why not 1/10
[07:02:48] <Satin> personal pizza slice at a supermarket or smth
[07:02:49] <JesseDesu> i like hawaiian pizza
[07:02:58] <Satin> MootPoot: 8/10 isn't good to eat for one person ever
[07:02:58] <mixfix41> if you are normally working then yeah its true exercise wont
[07:03:09] * Satin has done it before, to be clear.
[07:03:22] <Satin> mixfix41: no, excercise never will compensate for bad diet
[07:03:37] <Satin> mixfix41: you're burning calories, and you're eating mcdonalds and carb rich foods adn sugar
[07:03:44] <Satin> the excercise won't help there
[07:03:53] <JesseDesu> do you like mcdonalds coffee
[07:03:59] <Satin> i burn my tongue on it
[07:04:15] <Satin> i don't know how to drink that sort of coffee
[07:04:18] <Satin> as juvenile as that sounds
[07:04:18] <mixfix41> open your mind . if you are on something that is effecting your metabolism directly then take extra precautions if not then exercise will suffice imo
[07:04:35] <Satin> mixfix41: well the major part here is "bad diet"
[07:04:38] <JesseDesu> you put your lips on it and swallow
[07:04:43] <Satin> i'm assuming the average american that eats too much than they should
[07:04:53] <Satin> if you just go to mcdonalds or whatever  once in a while
[07:05:02] <Satin> then yeah it doesn't really matter in the big picture
[07:05:16] <Satin> but if you go fairly consistently then it doesn't matter how much you excercise or whatever
[07:05:20] <Satin> when ur diet's fucked
[07:05:33] <Satin>  don't expect excercise to remotely help
[07:05:52] <mixfix41> i mean if you work in a cafe. and you notice you gain weight and you start to do daily outdoor hobbies it may balance the cafe food actually
[07:05:55] <Satin> calories out calories in

[07:12:25] <Satin> no I just want to get down to my target goal
[07:12:29] <MootPoot> eat normally  5 days, severe deficit for 2 days
[07:12:35] <MootPoot> to lose weight
[07:12:35] <Satin> I've lost like close to 20 lbs already
[07:12:43] <Satin> i've been doing this all week
[07:12:55] <MootPoot> you sure you're not losing muscle mass
[07:13:02] <Satin> i can't tell

[07:13:54] <Satin> i'm fine though
[07:14:04] <MootPoot> eating that little = body eliminates your muscles first
[07:14:05] <MootPoot> not fat
[07:14:13] <MootPoot> and reduces your metabolism to match
[07:14:17] <Satin>  JesseDesu pretty :)
[07:14:35] <Satin> MootPoot: i have days where i eat more cals than just 300 or whatever
[07:14:43] <Satin> and some days where i eat nothing or very little
[07:14:47] <Satin> today was such a day
[07:14:54] <JesseDesu> satin, after i did that skull i realized i need to maximize my airbrushing potential
[07:14:56] <Satin> i had 3 chicken thighs, one cheesee slice, and a bit of mayo
[07:15:04] <MootPoot> you know severe deficit is like cutting more then 20%
[07:15:14] <MootPoot> from the sounds of it even your "I'm eating" days are more then that

[07:25:46] <MootPoot> I finished my final paper
[07:25:46] <Satin> i'd shake

[07:25:58] <MootPoot> Satin: well - if it makes you feel any better , I shake too
[07:26:04] <tcsilver> be well guys! I'll be back in a bit
[07:26:09] <MootPoot> except that's when my muscles get tired
[07:26:15] <MootPoot> or my hand hurts from shooting too much
[07:26:30] <Satin> i c
[07:26:43] <Satin> mine shake even when driving or whatever if i feel like there's danger or something
[07:26:52] <Satin> but usually i'm a retard when doing that
[07:26:56] <Satin> and have had lots of redbull
[07:27:05] <Satin> which escalates the tremors and hyperviligance ptsd shit
[07:27:06] <ButterNoodle> Satin shakes arent a big deal.. you can train to be efficient enough to get beyond it and defend urself if needed
[07:27:12] <MootPoot> when something is unexpected I'll freeze  for a second then do <automatiic action>
[07:27:12] <Satin> ButterNoodle: i c

[07:27:25] <Satin> i don't either
[07:27:27] <MootPoot> sometimes I cum
[07:27:30] <Satin> but the shakes are just unavoidable
[07:27:31] <Satin> MootPoot: no

[07:33:19] <Satin> seems that they can find no consistent pattern
[07:33:24] <Satin> to reach some sort of firm conclusion 
[07:33:30] <Satin> there are some differences in certain areas
[07:33:33] <MootPoot> sounds like my sleeping habits

[07:33:38] <MootPoot> no consistent pattern

[07:36:13] <amigojapan> Not me Satin 
[07:36:21] <Satin> that's a shame
[07:36:29] <mixfix41> satin tho i have to say its is extremely laughable when you say to people that excercise doesnt balance diet when its one of the things that balances life even if you have no weight issues youll have to have an outdoor regimen of any sort the things indoors leak chemicals we inhale
[07:37:15] <Satin> I don't know about the leak chemicals we  inhale shit
[07:37:22] <mixfix41> it certainly does
[07:37:32] <mixfix41> the couches computer plastics everything basically
[07:37:36] <Satin> but I specifically said this: excercise won't balance a **bad diet**
[07:37:44] <Satin> it won't "compensate" or make up for it
[07:37:52] <Satin> I didn't say that it doesn't balance diet
[07:38:28] <mixfix41> i wasnt clear on it
[07:38:39] <Satin> A good diet and adequate excercise will get you the results you want for sure
[07:39:10] <Satin> but if you both eat loads of bad/unhealthy food for you in excessive portions and at the same time excercise
[07:39:19] <Satin> the excercise won't help or reduce it
[07:39:25] <Satin> cals out, and then again cals in
[07:39:49] <mixfix41> oh i see i think the issue is a bit narrow to address for me then so you re right
[07:39:52] <Satin> not to mention it's extremely hard to burn a lot of calories with just excercise
[07:40:16] <Satin> so the good solution is, reduce your calorie intake, and then use excercise to calorie burn and build up your muscle strength as well
[07:40:16] <Satin> ye

[09:46:00] <ImoutoBot> TsundereNoises: (207 / 276) <T​sundereNoises> Okay, Elegant Chicken is a white-hair ojousama who has to move in with her aunt after her parents die. Just as she bonds to her kindly aunt, delinquent red-and-green-haired daughter Love Bird returns home and starts bullying Elegant Chicken who is now living in her old bedroom. But is this truly jealousy or the beginning of a fiery forbidden romance???

[09:54:03] <TsundereNoises> was I too mean?
[09:54:07] <TsundereNoises> or just my normal mean is too mean?
[09:54:25] <TsundereNoises> I wasn't trying to be, but I think I got a bit snappish
[09:54:39] <Satin> no, i think you were fine
[09:54:47] <Satin> it's not like they took visible offense at it either
[09:54:56] <TsundereNoises> yes but I worry
[09:54:59] <Satin> don't 
[09:55:06] <TsundereNoises> YOU CAN'T STOP ME
[09:55:07] <sentionics> pain sucks
[09:55:22] <TsundereNoises> sentionics: yeah, I cut my elbow right before I went to bed last night
[09:55:32] <TsundereNoises> really helped me sleep
[09:55:52] <sentionics> TsundereNoises, I'm begging a God I don't believe in, to forgive me
[09:56:02] <Satin> for what
[09:56:08] <sentionics> I'm f'd up
[09:56:13] <sentionics> I don't know mate
[09:56:27] <sentionics> I just feel I'm evil and f'd
[09:56:29] <TsundereNoises> yeah but I feel like your fucked-up-ness doesn't come from a place of evil/sin/fault or whatever
[09:56:50] <TsundereNoises> you have issues, but I feel like, from what I see, you're the one who suffers from your faults
[09:57:04] <TsundereNoises> that's not great, but it's not something to be forgiven
[09:57:18] <TsundereNoises> you should be nicer to sentionics though
[09:57:45] <sentionics> I should be... nicer to me?
[09:58:02] <TsundereNoises> yes
[09:58:10] <TsundereNoises> you can be a real ass to yourself
[09:58:13] <sentionics> f me
[09:58:38] <sentionics> I can do it.
[09:58:55] <sentionics> well, it's just me
[09:58:58] <sentionics> no big deal
[09:59:12] <sentionics> leave it to me
[09:59:43] <TsundereNoises> I'm my own worst enemy too, we should form a club
[09:59:47] <TsundereNoises> and then beat ourselves with it
[09:59:58] <sentionics> I feel very strong now. TsundereNoises, I love you!
[10:00:10] <TsundereNoises> aww
[10:00:12] <TsundereNoises> <3
[10:00:18] <sentionics> I'm with you!
[10:01:18] <sentionics> you said, you should be nicer to <userhandle> thought
[10:01:22] <sentionics> *though
[10:01:25] <sentionics> sorry, typo
[10:01:59] <sentionics> we use more than handles. We take complete personas where we go, or at least maybe I'm projecting, b/c that's what I do.
[10:02:37] <sentionics> I'm not real to people when I meet them irl. I just hide behind something I learned elsewhere.
[10:03:00] <TsundereNoises> I think we're all slightly different aspects of ourselves in each different group we interact with, yeah
[10:03:27] <sentionics> what even are we, TsundereNoises?
[10:04:08] <TsundereNoises> collections of electricity that have developed self awareness
[10:04:26] <sentionics> sentient electronics. Sentionics.
[10:04:51] <TsundereNoises> I think most people aren't "real" when they meet new people they don't give a shit about
[10:05:06] <TsundereNoises> friendly people aren't, for the most part, any better about that I think
[10:05:24] <sentionics> I'm terribly friendly, but I'm not alive.
[10:05:29] <sentionics> a friendly corpse.
[10:05:31] <TsundereNoises> you need to have something of a connection to people
[10:06:13] <sentionics> to connect.
[10:06:23] <sentionics> you have to have, something you both care about.
[10:06:29] <Matt|home> 1:45

[10:06:57] <Matt|home> o\
[10:07:43] <sentionics> I'm slapping myself too much and TsundereNoises is picking me up off my knees. TsundereNoises is with me.
[10:07:48] <TsundereNoises> sentionics: I'd bet there are weird psychological things in common among people who have lots of big conversations in text chats in general
[10:08:19] <sentionics> TsundereNoises, I feel. Such... anger.
[10:08:28] <sentionics> not at your or anyone.
[10:08:33] <sentionics> Don't know what it's at.
[10:08:40] <TsundereNoises> I'm angry at myself a lot
[10:08:41] <sentionics> It's not at me.
[10:08:44] <TsundereNoises> and/or the world
[10:08:47] <TsundereNoises> but right now not so much
[10:08:57] <TsundereNoises> 2022 is off to a decent start for me, a nice change from the last 2 years
[10:09:18] <sentionics> TsundereNoises, I think I have a good feeling about 2022
[10:09:22] <sentionics> don't know what it is
[10:09:32] <sentionics> but, it's a good feeling
[10:09:38] <TsundereNoises> this year has February 22, that's something to look forward to
[10:09:44] <sentionics> I think this year we can be, different
[10:10:04] <TsundereNoises> sentionics: I have officially not fucked up a plan I set for myself on the first day
[10:10:07] <sentionics> I could give less of a shit about the dumb calendar rules.
[10:10:13] <TsundereNoises> which is better than anything I've done in 2 years
[10:10:20] <TsundereNoises> yeah I just like numbers
[10:10:25] <TsundereNoises> 2/22/22
[10:10:55] <sentionics> well, at least it ain't 4's
[10:11:06] <sentionics> then it's be a year of evil in april
[10:11:37] <TsundereNoises> I spent fall of 2011 basically in a haze, so I'm back to thinking about 9/9/99
[10:12:04] <sentionics> 1999 is a meme
[10:12:25] <TsundereNoises> I mean, that's when the internet broke and destroyed civilization
[10:12:45] <sentionics> I would have shat my pants if I was paying attention
[10:12:48] <TsundereNoises> almost as bad as the mayans
[10:13:22] <sentionics> mate, they had some interesting shit they came up with
[10:13:28] <TsundereNoises> 0
[10:13:34] <sentionics> indigenous folks were freaking genius.
[10:14:12] <TsundereNoises> I've been on a kick of reading about the mississippians lately actually
[10:14:40] <sentionics> they have too many s's
[10:14:46] <TsundereNoises> sssssssssss
[10:14:54] <sentionics> ssisssisssisssipians
[10:16:00] <sentionics> I'm in Louisiana. My great grandparents, while they were alive, my parents took me to visit them. They lived in Mississippi.
[10:16:22] <sentionics> that road had some big hills. The road I remember.
[10:16:39] <sentionics> I was just a kid though, not sure what part of the way that was.
[10:17:08] <TsundereNoises> I have a lot of weirdly vivid specific memories as a kid too
[10:17:16] <TsundereNoises> where like I can't remember anything else around that one scene
[10:17:56] <sentionics> TsundereNoises, you're like me
[10:18:05] <sentionics> hey, I think I might be about to pass out
[10:18:12] <TsundereNoises> goodnight
[10:18:12] <sentionics> sorry if I got quiet all of a sudden
[10:18:17] <TsundereNoises> it's fine
[10:18:26] <sentionics> no, I'm here in my chair, not getting up
[10:18:28] <TsundereNoises> don't let the senti-pedes bite
[10:18:36] <sentionics> I'm here until I'm not
[10:18:45] <sentionics> that pun.
[10:18:59] <TsundereNoises> I can't help it, it's almost 2 am
[10:19:00] <sentionics> you are an artist.
[10:19:39] <sentionics> I feel strong. I feel I won't pass out now.
[10:20:01] <sentionics> I am with you, TsundereNoises 
[10:21:43] <TsundereNoises> glad to hear it but I need to poop
[10:21:43] <TsundereNoises> which I will do alone
[10:21:53] <sentionics> do that alone

[12:58:44] <sentionics> 3 hr 54 minutes. that's a nightmare to only have that much. I've lived that repeatedly. I thought coming out of college, I'd finally be free of putting myself through that hell.
[12:58:51] <sentionics> I was very very very wrong.

[13:08:04] <sentionics> analoq, I dream of this
[13:08:27] <sentionics> analoq, thank you for telling me this. I am hungry for dreaming of this. Maybe I should sleep.
[13:08:29] <analoq> sentionics: why did you only sleep 4h while in college though? isnt college chill time?
[13:08:50] <sentionics> it was only the bad moments that happened, mate
[13:09:02] <sentionics> I usually did whatever I wanted
[13:09:13] <sentionics> I procrastinated assignments and projects.
[13:09:32] <sentionics> they were all, oh it's due tomorrow. and good bye sleep.
[13:10:04] <sentionics> I never said I was smart.
[13:10:35] <sentionics> well, maybe I did, but I was wrong if I said such a thing.
[13:10:44] <analoq> friend of mine is a master at that too. i thought i gave no fucks, but that guy pushs it to another level. his bachelor thesis was like 15pages total, written in the week before it was due

[13:11:26] <sentionics> a thesis... in a week
[13:11:39] <analoq> my brother is currently in his 16th semester or so (i stopped counting) for his bachelor (6 semesters) xD

[13:18:05] <sentionics> I was taking flying lessons at the time
[13:18:20] <analoq> eh ppl. do crazy stuff. i know a super nice dude, who i later learned got once busted for armed robbery. 
[13:18:46] <sentionics> so against good sense, I drove zero sleep, crashing hard off of adhd pill (concerta), and I went to my flying less
[13:18:49] <sentionics> *lesson
[13:19:35] <sentionics> analoq, whoa, that blows what I was saying out of the water I guess. I won't judge that man. Sometimes people are in desperate situations and do crazy things.
[13:20:09] <analoq> i mean technically you were sober right? :P
[13:20:42] <sentionics> (to complete the story, my flight instructor put me into a simulator into flying. Did he know my condition or something? He said I did really well though)
[13:21:09] <sentionics> my flight instructor never before or after put me in the simulator.
[13:21:14] <sentionics> it was always real flying
[13:21:22] <sentionics> guess he had a hunch or something.
[13:22:02] <sentionics> yeah sure, sober. You know what's really bad, operating anything if you are t-minus a day's worth of sleep.
[13:22:02] <analoq> but yeah not the nicest thing to do~
[13:22:50] <sentionics> I drove home afterwards. My best friend called me.
[13:23:08] <sentionics> He's like, parents are here, wanna join us?
[13:23:13] <sentionics> I said, sure!
[13:23:27] <sentionics> The fun don't stop until you're ready to drop.
[13:23:33] <sentionics> that was a long day.
[13:23:48] <analoq> :P did you get your pilot license in the end?
[13:23:54] <sentionics> no
[13:24:00] <analoq> :(
[13:24:08] <sentionics> passed the written test and the oral test.
[13:24:22] <sentionics> I didn't take the practical (it was all that was left)

[13:24:31] <sentionics> I feel like I would have passed that
[13:24:39] <sentionics> but... it's for the best that I didn't.
[13:25:00] <sentionics> I struggled with motion sickness when I flew
[13:25:24] <sentionics> strange thing though. If I flew alone, I didn't get sick. I don't have a lot of solo time though.
[13:25:35] <analoq> flying is to expensive here sadly. i flew a glider once with a trainer onboard, but it's to much hassle
[13:25:35] <sentionics> may just be coincidence.
[13:25:55] <analoq> it was rad though
[13:26:05] <sentionics> whoa, I want to fly a glider
[13:26:14] <sentionics> I flew in Cessnas

[13:26:24] <analoq> the launch is pretty sick
[13:26:37] <sentionics> 150 for the first 10~ hours. 172's the remaining 80+ hours
[13:27:23] <analoq> do you have to fullfill anual flying quotas to maintain the license where you live?
[13:27:26] <sentionics> analoq, crazy thing. The microsoft flight simulator game, that shit actually changed my effectiveness landing.
[13:27:52] <sentionics> I went from dogshit to making my instructor's jaw drop between 2 lessons.
[13:28:30] <analoq> :D i can believe that. i had a similar experience with car sims
[13:28:52] <sentionics> analoq, I really don't know the details anymore. That was over 13 years ago. I know you have to keep a medical certification current. But once you have a private pilot's license, that's for life unless it's taken away.

[13:31:45] <sentionics> I can probably still land a Cessna smooth as butter. I can feel it in me still. Like it was yesterday.
[13:32:14] <analoq> isnt the landing the hardest part?
[13:32:26] <analoq> i mean once you are in the air, it's not exactly difficult
[13:32:26] <sentionics> it's my FAVOURITE part.
[13:32:47] <analoq> yeah but if you can do that, why dont you trust yourself flying right now?
[13:32:49] <sentionics> nothing feels better than touching down smooth, mate. nothing.
[13:33:09] <sentionics> what, you think landing is the hard part?
[13:33:29] <sentionics> anyway, no, I would not fly with me.
[13:33:29] <analoq> idk, thats what i think, but it was a question
[13:33:52] <sentionics> thing is, there's lots you gotta do while flying.
[13:34:12] <sentionics> people don't do what they're supposed to out there.
[13:34:20] <analoq> i mean sure getting your plane out of a stall is probably harder, but that's not something that is supposed to happen anyways :P
[13:34:21] <sentionics> heard of defensive driving?
[13:34:31] <sentionics> 100 times that while flying

[18:00:39] <ButterNoodle> thats a good one
[18:00:53] <Roey> LOL
[18:01:04] <Roey> hahahaha
[18:01:25] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: I told wibblewb you said hello. He said he will come here
[18:02:12] <darkwitch> I heard they add wood chips or basically sawdust to bread in the us, since the fda allows is and it's cheaper than real flour
[18:03:39] <darkwitch> they list it as "cellulose"
[18:03:51] <darkwitch> sneaky people
[18:04:25] <amigojapan> darkwitch: does it have carbs?
[18:04:45] <amigojapan> darkwitch: maybe I should try it
[18:04:50] <darkwitch> no, it's fiber that the body can't do much with
[18:05:08] <amigojapan> Good good. I approve
[18:05:58] <darkwitch> so it doesn't matter if 10% of your parmesan cheese is sawdust?
[18:06:16] <amigojapan> I thought you said bread
[18:06:40] <amigojapan> I rather it be more than just 10 precent
[18:07:13] <darkwitch> Tomato sauce, Salad dressing, Ice cream bars, Whole wheat bread, Granola bars, Packaged cookies, Bagels, Frozen breakfast sandwiches, Frozen diet entrées, Breakfast cereal, etc.
[18:10:57] <amigojapan> darkwitch: but you say it as if they were doing something wrong
[18:11:27] <darkwitch> it's not something people expect to be in those foods
[18:12:45] <ButterNoodle> dang amigojapan.. was bringing up the ButterNoodle all it took?
[18:13:47] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: also explained what happened to freenode
[18:14:44] * Sadale licks analoq
[18:15:14] <ButterNoodle> ic
[18:15:22] <ButterNoodle> I think thats a big problem
[18:18:20] <`Zephyr> I assume they wouldn't allow putting sawdust in food unless it was safe, but that would involve me giving the US FDA more credit than they deserve. IS it safe to consume sawdust? 
[18:18:39] <Sadale> nya~ :3
[18:19:18] <darkwitch> yes, it's safe to consume sawdust, at least in small amounts
[18:19:43] <mixfix41> no nuts in sawdust
[18:19:44] <amigojapan> darkwitch: many things people don't expect are in food, saw dust is probably not the worst
[18:19:51] <darkwitch> if they could find something even cheaper as a filler material, I'm sure they would
[18:20:40] <amigojapan> darkwitch: I like granola bars that taste like saw dust
[18:21:26] <`Zephyr> It would be hard to find something cheaper than sawdust.
[18:21:50] <darkwitch> chalk?
[18:21:54] <amigojapan> `Zephyr: raw sewage
[18:21:56] <MootPoot> poo
[18:22:42] <amigojapan> darkwitch: can we eat chalk?
[18:22:59] <mixfix41> artisans dont knowingly know theres wood particles in flour
[18:23:10] <mixfix41> there cant be
[18:24:59] <`Zephyr> <MootPoot> poo <-- all food has trace amounts of poo in them already.
[18:25:07] <`Zephyr> Everything you've ever eaten had trace amounts of bugs and poo.
[18:25:18] <MootPoot> well, it damn better have cute girl poo

[18:30:49] <Sadale> analoq, Funny how even older model of raspberry pi's getting out of stock. Not my problem tho. I got paid to port the program to the latest verison of the pi. :P
[18:30:52] <analoq> Sadale: do you happen to have good sources where one could find lowend freescale stuff and microchip pics?
[18:30:58] <amigojapan> darkwitch: no. Okara is a waste product from making tofu
[18:31:02] <Sadale> analoq, nope. sorry
[18:31:14] <Sadale> analoq, I could help you to ask tho. I'm in a community that may have this kind of connection
[18:31:20] <analoq> Sadale: yeah we are porting a lot as well. and once you are done porting you port again lol
[18:31:25] <darkwitch> amigojapan, I haven't heard about it then
[18:31:38] <analoq> it s like a cat and mouse game
[18:31:42] <Sadale> analoq, I wouldn't mind. I got paid anyway. In fact, porting makes me valuable. :P

[23:24:24] <ButterNoodle> the p210 has made a comeback, but I'd prefer an older model
