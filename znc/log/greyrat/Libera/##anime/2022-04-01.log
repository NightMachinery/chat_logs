[00:00:07] <emmeka> I think specifically it was ButterNoodle that registered it, right?
[00:00:15] <ButterNoodle> nope
[00:00:20] <emmeka> or was that the other temporary channel...
[00:00:23] <emmeka> anyway
[00:00:24] <ButterNoodle> I have/had ##otaku
[00:00:27] <emmeka> right.
[00:00:33] <luke-jr> justanotheruser: my role was supervising the ops, apparently Nanobot doesn't like oversight
[00:00:33] <JesseDesu> TLDR
[00:00:44] <justanotheruser> if only there was +FN(eutered) mode
[00:00:55] <justanotheruser> where you have +F but can't do anything with it
[00:00:58] <emmeka> justanotheruser luke's opinion is that +F is for supervising ops and not for opping, to rule as king over vassals or whatever
[00:01:00] <justanotheruser> luke-jr: would that be acceptable?
[00:01:01] <S_T_A_N> lol what the fuck
[00:01:11] <luke-jr> justanotheruser: no?
[00:01:13] <justanotheruser> not that I have any say
[00:01:16] <justanotheruser> just asking hypothetically
[00:01:26] <justanotheruser> luke-jr: but you agreed to never use your +F powers

[00:01:40] <JesseDesu> history is long and disputed
[00:01:43] <Nanobot> luke-jr: You never even joined the channel where all the ops discuss op things. What supervising were you doing?
[00:02:05] <luke-jr> Nanobot: the secret channel you never invited me to*
[00:02:06] <ButterNoodle> didnt l0d3 have #anime?
[00:02:10] <emmeka> when I listed all ops that supported merging the channels in a public chat, he instantly removed all flags from every op I mentioned in freenode #anime before the de-reg
[00:02:16] <ButterNoodle> or was that ##anime
[00:02:17] <Nanobot> luke-jr: It wasn't secret. We talked about it in the main channel repeatedly
[00:02:24] <ButterNoodle> hes funny

[00:03:05] <SaladChampion> #femmanime
[00:03:40] <emmeka> justanotheruser basically he proved our point. We were all only ok with luke's position insofar as he didn't use it, and then the moment it was even considered that his position would be threatened, he stripped all flags from absolutely everyone
[00:03:42] <emmeka> except Voh, lol
[00:03:45] <luke-jr> anyway, Libera discredited themselves by enabling the takeover, so freenode seems to be the best IRC network to stay on at this point
[00:04:00] <justanotheruser> luke-jr: you violated your promise?
[00:04:00] <emmeka> because I didn't explicitly mention Voh in the list of ops that wanted the merger under Nanobot, lol
[00:04:05] <luke-jr> justanotheruser: what promise?

[00:04:27] <luke-jr> why would people plotting a hostile takeover, be entrusted with ops?
[00:04:34] <justanotheruser> not the question
[00:04:43] <luke-jr> I don't know what promise you're talking about
[00:04:55] <justanotheruser> to not use your +F power
[00:05:07] <luke-jr> I didn't say that tho
[00:05:14] <justanotheruser> what did you say?
[00:05:29] <emmeka> anyway now he's just our toothless cranky uncle, still going on about the good old days
[00:05:38] <luke-jr> if you want to continue the discussion, we can chat on freenode #anime
[00:05:42] <emmeka> lol
[00:06:01] <luke-jr> don't care to lend this illegitimate channel any more apparent credibility
[00:06:04] <luke-jr> by chatting here
[00:06:18] <Zoidberg> emmeka: it's amusing that all this fuss is over an irc channel and that too anime
[00:06:59] <emmeka> if only luke-jr would realize that he could just come hang out and everything is chill and we still love him and his zany worldview
[00:07:06] <justanotheruser> emmeka: luke-jr is Maduro and nanobot is Guaid√≥
[00:07:19] <justanotheruser> you are a coup plotter
[00:07:21] <justanotheruser> :^)
[00:07:37] <luke-jr> emmeka: I am hanging out on #anime just as I always have
[00:07:41] <emmeka> poor metaphor, considering Guaido failed hilariously
[00:07:51] <luke-jr> you can come back and join me rather than supporting this Libera nonsense
[00:08:20] <emmeka> luke-jr unfortunately the network known as freenode is now dead, you are hanging out in an entirely new channel on an entirely new network, and that's k. obviously everyone here is fine with you having Freenode 2.0 #anime.
[00:08:29] <luke-jr> emmeka: that's a lie
[00:08:36] <emmeka> which part?
[00:08:39] <luke-jr> all of it
[00:08:44] <emmeka> dubious.
[00:08:52] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Libera seems to have become some garbage aggregator with lacking documetation
[00:08:59] <Aurora_v_kosmose> *documentation
[00:09:00] <S_T_A_N> luke-jr, yet you are still here
[00:09:03] <Zoidberg> luke-jr: even if the ops join, most people here have abandoned freenode after the takeover
[00:09:12] <S_T_A_N> you could just... leave. And never come back
[00:09:12] <luke-jr> Zoidberg: on false pretenses
[00:09:15] <Zoidberg> luke-jr: it's not just anime, in all the channels
[00:09:39] <luke-jr> people should come back
[00:09:48] <Aurora_v_kosmose> luke-jr: Tell lee to fix the Tor documentation
[00:09:55] <emmeka> luke-jr doesn't even seem to think much of the fact that we basically just let him come here and go "hey, come back to freenode, leave this channel, come to mine, it'll be great, these guys suck"
[00:09:58] <Zoidberg> luke-jr: so like 10000+ people have abandoned on false pretenses?
[00:09:59] <luke-jr> Lee isn't around much, but I can poke the staff
[00:10:09] <luke-jr> Zoidberg: yes
[00:10:16] <Aurora_v_kosmose> luke-jr: That works.
[00:10:23] <justanotheruser> emmeka: #anime always let me do that without ban
[00:10:35] <emmeka> justanotheruser but your cause was righteous
[00:10:36] <justanotheruser> except I said #yandere
[00:10:41] <justanotheruser> emmeka: yes
[00:10:46] <Zoidberg> luke-jr: not good pitching to join freenode
[00:10:56] <justanotheruser> spamming people to join #yandere is always righteous
[00:11:22] <luke-jr> #yandere is on freenode too

[00:11:33] <Cryowolf> hai hooo
[00:12:01] <justanotheruser> luke-jr: how many people are in freenode #yandere
[00:12:09] <emmeka> luke-jr anyway what lie, nobody challenged your right to freenode #anime, it is as you want, yours. feel free to hold onto it until the end of days.

[00:13:05] <luke-jr> justanotheruser: but #yandere always struggled‚Ä¶
[00:13:17] <Bco1981> yes... it's false that everyone got kicked out of the network
[00:13:20] <emmeka> is Libera the legitimate successor to old Freenode, or is new Freenode the legitimate successor?
[00:13:27] <Bco1981> it's just a lie
[00:13:28] <justanotheruser> yes, even with my righteous efforts (as described by emmeka) #yandere was mostly dead
[00:13:29] <emmeka> you have to pick one...
[00:14:41] <emmeka> unless the official luke opinion is that all anime channels on all networks descended from the original freenode are, inherently and by their nature, the domain of luke-jr to be held in his esteemed +F-ship for all time
[00:15:10] <S_T_A_N> emmeka, we all know that's exactly iy
[00:15:11] <luke-jr> emmeka: it seems clear now that freenode remains freenode, and Libera is feigning continuity on false pretenses; #anime is just a clear example of how it is a scam
[00:15:11] <S_T_A_N> it
[00:15:22] <emmeka> luke-jr ok then we're good?
[00:15:32] <emmeka> like clearly everything is right in the world then
[00:15:40] <luke-jr> no
[00:15:50] <JesseDesu> whoa butternoodle is that a gold commercial
[00:16:04] <luke-jr> you're still falsely claiming to be freenode #anime moved

[00:17:46] <emmeka> luke-jr well, consider it done. This is ##anime on libera. an anime community on an IRC network completely different from old #anime of Freenode, constituted of people from various previous channels.
[00:18:09] <justanotheruser> so I guess the resolution is to just put "not affiliated with or having lineage from freenode #anime" in the topic

[00:23:57] <luke-jr> I'm still not interested in giving this network any credibility
[00:24:06] <emmeka> so that's a no then

[00:31:33] <S_T_A_N> The only person they have any more power over than they used to is.... luke-jr

[00:46:49] <ButterNoodle> wanna see how the kinder gentler ops handle problem users of the past :)
[00:47:04] <hauki> Ashita no Joe.
[00:47:12] <Zoidberg> woah
[00:47:20] <Zoidberg> you surprised me hauki 
[00:47:21] <Poeticode> !a ashita no joe

[00:51:09] <hauki> And I don't like Evangelion either :)
[00:51:15] <emmeka> on both accounts, see for example the work that studio Orange does, proving that "good anime CGI" is possible.
[00:51:31] <emmeka> Land of the Lustrous and so on
[00:51:40] <hauki> Good CGI is definitely possible, especially with high budget films.
[00:51:43] <ButterNoodle> awww come on, a horribly disgusting cgi monster the likes of gibiate doesnt get ur bokki in gear?
[00:51:48] <Zoidberg> hauki: wait, even beastars?
[00:51:52] <emmeka> but also you're missing out on a pretty solid 20 years of anime
[00:52:12] <hauki> That is true, but I have of course watched some series.
[00:52:13] <emmeka> Beastars is also studio Orange
[00:52:32] <ButterNoodle> *more anime created in the past 10 years than from all anime up until 10 years ago
[00:52:42] <emmeka> really, I wish all anime studios would follow their example, they prove that good CG on a regular airing show is possible and viable.
[00:52:53] <ButterNoodle> !a gibiate
[00:52:54] <ImoutoBot> ButterNoodle: I don't recognize that anime.
[00:53:07] <emmeka> ButterNoodle it's pretty crazy, right. how much we have.

[00:54:36] <ButterNoodle> yea gibiate.. 2nd worst anime on my completed list
[00:54:39] <Urchin[emacs]> I tend to like older stuff better
[00:54:51] <Urchin[emacs]> but it's more that newer stuff interest me less and less
[00:54:55] <Zoidberg> hauki: have you watched the recent nge films?
[00:55:08] <Urchin[emacs]> too many pointless uninteresting isekai junk
[00:55:16] <Urchin[emacs]> shows
[00:55:18] <emmeka> hauki like don't get me wrong, gotta respect the classics and there's something about the whole pre-Eva era of anime that is lost aesthetically and thematically in today's shows, but there's excellent modern content not to be overlooked even by someone committed to the old-school.
[00:55:39] <emmeka> sure, there's *a lot* of trash, but there's a lot of gems too
[00:55:51] <Jigsy> I love trash.
[00:56:14] <Zoidberg> trash taste?
[00:56:19] <emmeka> are you familiar with the medlar, Jigsy
[00:56:33] <Jigsy> Medlar?
[00:56:48] <Urchin[emacs]> most of the new stuff just doesn't hit what I got into anime for
[00:56:48] <emmeka> it is a tree which grows a fruit which, when fresh, doesn't taste very good. but when allowed to rot, the fruit becomes sweet and tasty.
[00:57:20] <emmeka> much of anime follows the same principle as the medlar tree
[00:57:21] <Jigsy> So it's like a reverse Durian?
[00:57:36] <hauki> I'm not committed to anything really, I just like 80's both drawing and animation styles, which in themselves are poor to some extent, but to my liking.
[00:57:50] <Jigsy> I need to finish watching Shogi loli.
[00:57:57] <Jigsy> Been busy for most of the week, so haven't seen anything.
[00:58:02] <hauki> But no, I haven't watched ANYTHING recent.
[00:58:17] <emmeka> damn.
[00:58:29] <hauki> Maybe 2004-2005 series are the latest.
[00:58:30] <Urchin[emacs]> it was weird that I found two shows the previous season that I was interested in
[00:58:47] <hauki> Kaiji 2 maybe?
[00:58:57] <emmeka> hauki I mean did you watch FMA:B?
[00:59:13] <Jigsy> I need to finish Hakozume.
[00:59:27] <emmeka> even that now is fairly old, though
[00:59:32] <hauki> emmeka: no.
[00:59:46] <Poeticode> i watch garbage isekais like it's my job
[01:00:20] <Jigsy> All I've seen this week is a few episodes of Quincy.

[01:00:38] <emmeka> hauki huh. well many people consider it among the best anime ever made, and I think someone coming from a background of 80s anime can appreciate it.
[01:00:57] <hauki> FMA is Full Metal Alchemist I presume?
[01:01:09] <hauki> Never watched series either.
[01:01:12] <emmeka> yes. there are two versions of the anime, confusingly.
[01:01:40] <Urchin[emacs]> '90s are my favored decade, TBH
[01:01:55] <Zoidberg> hauki: I strongly recommend to watch beastars. It isn't like any anime you watched
[01:02:04] <hauki> To be honest, I mostly like teenage love affair kind of thing, like Adachi's Touch, Hiatari Ryuoko and H2.
[01:02:08] <emmeka> the first branched off from the manga and made up its own story and had a completely anime-original ending. It isn't bad - it even handles the beginning in a way some find stronger than Brotherhood - but it's not as good as the remake, true to the manga, which is called Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood.
[01:02:15] <emmeka> Zoidberg that's... quite the rec.
[01:02:28] <emmeka> you're going to rec someone who's only watched 80s/90s anime a furry CGI show?
[01:02:30] <hauki> And I'd say Touch is there with Ashita no Joe as favourite series.
[01:02:34] <Zoidberg> I so so so much love beastars
[01:03:04] <emmeka> it is good, but it's probably not the right approach :P
[01:03:25] <hauki> I've been trying to start Aoki Densetsu Shoot for over a year now, but never do.
[01:03:27] <Urchin[emacs]> for the next season I'm looking forward to Spy x Family, and couple of sequels
[01:03:58] <hauki> Or any other series in fact, but I did watch Ashita no Joe (both series) for the tenth time last year :D
[01:04:17] <Zoidberg> hmm
[01:04:50] <hauki> The problem is, reading takes most of my time these days - time that could alloted to watching anime.
[01:04:58] <Zoidberg> sleepy now, later

[02:45:31] <Fenderbassist> unless you're talking about puer tea cakes that cost many thousands of dollars per
[02:45:45] <Fenderbassist> then you have a debate
[02:45:54] <Fenderbassist> and then you add in fresh red coffee beans just picked
[02:45:58] <Fenderbassist> and you have a stellar debate
[02:46:00] <Poeticode> coffee's just about high elevation and monkey poop
[02:46:33] <Fenderbassist> coffee beans roasted an hour ago are awesome, puerh tea cakes that are top rated are kept by the wealthy Chinese for themselves, must be amazing
[02:46:51] <Fenderbassist> and I'll never know
[02:46:54] <Fenderbassist> cause they don't sell it
[02:47:33] <Poeticode> meanwhile coffee has nothing worth hoarding
[02:47:44] <Fenderbassist> nope, after about 2 weeks they're all stale and dead
[02:47:50] <Fenderbassist> still tasty but no longer "alive"
[02:48:02] <Fenderbassist> and something is lost in the aging
[02:48:19] <Fenderbassist> whereas puer has microbe that you feed oxygen and humidity to age the teas and make them better

[02:49:32] <Fenderbassist> takes about 30 years on a sheng (raw) 
[02:50:17] <Fenderbassist> coffee need to be freshly picked and roasted, and my understanding is that there are shops opening up with such coffee...starting in Seattle I believe

[03:07:23] <bxgelsan> the next generation wont be filled with co2, i didn
[03:07:27] <bxgelsan> t have the best airflow
[03:07:32] <bxgelsan> but i learned how to fix it
[03:07:47] <bxgelsan> mushrooms and too much co2 = sad mushrooms
[03:08:22] <bxgelsan> Fenderbassist: ill tell you what. ill never forget greenbean casserole with mushrooms i grew myself
[03:08:26] <bxgelsan> pink oysters
[03:08:27] <bxgelsan> :)
[03:08:50] <bxgelsan> it was extra good because i put a lot of effort into it. and other people enjoyed it.
[03:09:43] <bxgelsan> the harvest wasnt that amazing but it was enough for thanksgiving for a family
[03:09:50] <Fenderbassist> yeah you said it was a hit
[03:09:59] <Fenderbassist> and of course you learn as you go
[03:10:05] <Fenderbassist> so it will only get better
[03:10:15] <bxgelsan> Fenderbassist: she never gave my giant mushroom book back
[03:10:18] <bxgelsan> im gonna have to rebuy
[03:10:20] <Fenderbassist> loo
[03:10:24] <Fenderbassist> yeah
[03:10:26] <bxgelsan> it has a lot of info
[03:10:43] <Fenderbassist> sounds a hair expensive lol
[03:10:49] <bxgelsan> no
[03:10:51] <Fenderbassist> important books like that
[03:11:01] <Fenderbassist> I had herbal reference books that weren't cheap either
[03:11:01] <bxgelsan> the book was less than 50
[03:11:07] <Fenderbassist> oh that's not bad
[03:11:11] <bxgelsan> hair is gonna be 300 after tip 
[03:11:12] <bxgelsan> but
[03:11:18] <bxgelsan> i kinda want to spend less on top
[03:11:20] <bxgelsan> tip
[03:11:23] <bxgelsan> :\
[03:11:28] <Fenderbassist> oh wasn't referring to hair cut, was an expression
[03:11:32] <bxgelsan> oh
[03:11:34] <bxgelsan> misread :p
[03:11:41] <Fenderbassist> a hair expensive or a touch expensive or a bit expensive
[03:11:58] <bxgelsan> Fenderbassist: the information in the book is very valuable.
[03:12:03] <Fenderbassist> indeedy
[03:12:08] <bxgelsan> teaches you from bottom to top
[03:12:28] <bxgelsan> and its not just about growing, its about the entire mycology system :p
[03:12:33] <bxgelsan> in and out lab
[03:12:41] <Fenderbassist> that sounds perfect for you
[03:13:00] <bxgelsan> yea. did i tell you i picked up a book that puts you on a list recently?
[03:13:01] <bxgelsan> its good
[03:13:07] <bxgelsan> survival stuff
[03:13:26] <bxgelsan> i mean i know a lot of it, but its good to stay in practice.
[03:13:39] <Fenderbassist> you seem to enjoy that
[03:13:54] <bxgelsan> Fenderbassist: i can make a lean to fairly quick, not a great brag but. a lot of people cant even bake chicken.
[03:14:19] <Fenderbassist> a lot of people have never left an apartment building for a wilderness, so it's only reasonable
[03:14:27] <Fenderbassist> re: James Burke, Connections episode 1
[03:14:49] <bxgelsan> Fenderbassist: i dont even care too much, but the people that fucked with me. i fucked right back the best I could.
[03:14:55] <bxgelsan> sent them on goose chases, fuckem
[03:14:57] <bxgelsan> :)

[03:15:33] <bxgelsan> just wish PTSD wasnt a thing
[03:16:04] <Fenderbassist> indeed
[03:16:06] <bxgelsan> but it actually makes me more capiable of assessing some situations
[03:16:13] <bxgelsan> learning to work around it
[03:16:22] <Fenderbassist> perhaps it will also make you draw less and less attention over time
[03:16:27] <Fenderbassist> the kind that you don't want
[03:16:45] <Fenderbassist> no more reminding the wrong people that "you're still here"
[03:16:49] <Fenderbassist> on a regular basis
[03:16:55] <bxgelsan> Fenderbassist: yeah, i already set in motion exposing local corruption. sbi/fbi came in. havent payed attention to how much they are doing, which is kinda a lie.
[03:17:08] <Fenderbassist> tmi
[03:17:10] <bxgelsan> dont need to poke the bear
[03:17:11] <bxgelsan> again

[03:17:41] <bxgelsan> i poked the bear, now change is in action. and i fade away into a happy existance.
[03:17:42] <Fenderbassist> shot enough arrows at the bear
[03:17:44] <bxgelsan> :)
[03:17:47] <bxgelsan> yep
[03:17:51] <Fenderbassist> it bit your leg off

[05:11:40] <BillyZane> ButterNoodle, the USA isn't perfect, actually it's been horribly brutal at times, but i can't think of any great power that hasn't been. it's a dog-eat-dog world. if given the choice between the USA and china, i'd pick the USA. we have freedoms we take for granted here.
[05:12:46] <ButterNoodle> BillyZane: I mean.. ur kinda missing the point.. completely
[05:12:54] <BillyZane> ButterNoodle, what's your point then?
[05:13:05] <ButterNoodle> first not saying any other cuntry is "better"
[05:13:14] <ButterNoodle> nor am I pissing on america
[05:13:24] <BillyZane> ok
[05:13:35] <Fenderbassist> he's just displeased with what's been going on
[05:13:42] <ButterNoodle> out of control, out of touch government spending..
[05:13:42] <Fenderbassist> who isn't , really
[05:14:05] <ButterNoodle> if the past 14 years hasnt pissed u off.. the last 2 should have
[05:14:06] <BillyZane> ButterNoodle, i see
[05:14:26] <ButterNoodle> now couple that with out of control inflation like we havent seen since ww2
[05:14:37] <ButterNoodle> "hyper inflation" is the new word
[05:14:38] <Fenderbassist> and supply chain issues
[05:14:54] <ButterNoodle> Fenderbassist: havent got that far yet.. I'm still in my front yard
[05:15:02] <Fenderbassist> I understand sir
[05:15:45] <ButterNoodle> now lets talk about the exponential increase in housing costs... and how every tom dick and harry has access to all this credit
[05:15:54] <ButterNoodle> re: housing collapse 2008
[05:16:29] <ButterNoodle> combine that with the largest transfer of wealth in our history as a result of covid..
[05:17:01] <BillyZane> those are pretty big issues for sure
[05:17:05] <ButterNoodle> its going to be a bumpy ride to say the least.. bring a pillow to sit on
[05:17:15] <ButterNoodle> maybe an ass donut and some prep h
[05:17:45] <BillyZane> it sounds bad, but i don't think it's that bad
[05:17:53] <BillyZane> there are certain benefits to this situation
[05:18:04] <ButterNoodle> anyone that doesnt have 10K+ of liquidity is going to be at risk of losing what they have
[05:18:07] <ButterNoodle> true
[05:18:26] <BillyZane> i think the US economy is dynamic enough to emerge out of this, restructured, and better, faster, cheaper
[05:18:39] <ButterNoodle> for sure.. I'm fortunate, and have taking a lot of folding money into gold and crypto
[05:18:49] <ButterNoodle> its never better faster cheaper
[05:18:50] <ButterNoodle> ever
[05:18:56] <BillyZane> i hardly have any!
[05:18:59] <BillyZane> i'm one of the broke ones
[05:19:03] <BillyZane> i never invested in crypto
[05:19:05] <ButterNoodle> ask anyone that has lived through these cycles
[05:19:17] <BillyZane> in fact, i lost money in crypto
[05:19:20] <BillyZane> i lost over $10,000 USD
[05:19:23] <ButterNoodle> Fenderbassist: how many of these have u seen?
[05:19:37] <ButterNoodle> BillyZane: you took my advise of buy high and sell low?
[05:19:39] <BillyZane> i shouldn't say i don't invest in crypto, but it's better to think that
[05:19:44] <BillyZane> but it's fine
[05:19:55] <BillyZane> retiring on other people's misfortune
[05:20:04] <BillyZane> i know many people who lost money in crypto
[05:20:06] <BillyZane> most people have

[05:20:28] <ButterNoodle> I'm literally not paying any attention to what I have in crypto tbh
[05:20:34] <ButterNoodle> gold and silver tho..
[05:21:01] <BillyZane> yeah it's fine, i don't put much merit on material wealth
[05:21:01] <ButterNoodle> hasnt lost over a 5 year stretch as far back as I have looked

[05:21:32] <BillyZane> i'll be fine regardless
[05:21:50] <ButterNoodle> then why debate it w me? I do agree

[05:24:47] <ButterNoodle> most of what I have was bought low or mined at 1/3 of cost
[05:25:11] <ButterNoodle> and I dont plan on selling until it hits at least 100K
[05:25:17] <BillyZane> it shouldn't be that easy to get rich

[05:33:09] <BillyZane> no
[05:33:31] <ButterNoodle> it doesnt matter ur work output.. everyone makes the same
[05:33:41] <BillyZane> that's not what i meant though
[05:33:47] <ButterNoodle> the dood that disappears to the shitter and sleeps for 3 hrs a day...
[05:33:51] <ButterNoodle> same $$$$
[05:34:05] <BillyZane> i mean even established companies like blockbusters are capable of going bankrupt
[05:34:30] <ButterNoodle> come on tho.. our gov made it ez to fuck people over and get rich - they hired some of the best to do it after the great depression
[05:35:08] <BillyZane> you want people to succeed, because if no one succeeds, especially in agriculture, you could have famine
[05:35:09] <ButterNoodle> did anyone wake up in 2004 and say... damn I gotta rewind that movie and drop it off
[05:35:27] <ButterNoodle> *from the country that pays farmers to not farm...
[05:35:49] <BillyZane> but you don't want it to be so easy either, because that means the market competition isn't there. someone needs to be above and beyond the norm, to the point where the competition is difficult
[05:36:29] <ButterNoodle> yea
[05:36:54] <ButterNoodle> like 3% of the people owning 95% of the wealth
[05:37:12] <BillyZane> concentration of wealth is important imho
[05:37:22] <BillyZane> if we distributed all the wealth 100% equally
[05:37:27] <BillyZane> it would concentrate once again
[05:37:32] <BillyZane> it's a natural phenomenon
[05:37:44] <BillyZane> and during that period, we'd have an economy that's not investing in the future
[05:37:50] <ButterNoodle> and create an income gap so great that even when ur taco bell take out tuesday poor.. at least ur not hot dog and bologna wednesday poor
[05:38:44] <ButterNoodle> thats the problem with wealth.. when u have enough ur invested in the future by default
[05:38:58] <ButterNoodle> like all the big businesses that survived covid..
[05:39:03] <BillyZane> having large social safety nets are great for average, everyday people. it improves the quality of life, but it degrades the quality of life for their great-grand children. it was the sacrifices of generations before us that got us to where we are
[05:39:21] <ButterNoodle> sure they can keep their doors closed for 6 months.. a year.. they have cash reserves

[05:40:19] <BillyZane> ButterNoodle, yup
[05:41:27] <ButterNoodle> *watching this guy play with his dick and gonna get a shower
[05:42:12] <BillyZane> ButterNoodle, they are bailing out small businesses if i recall
[05:42:20] <BillyZane> ButterNoodle, there was talks of restaurants getting huge credits
[05:42:34] <BillyZane> ButterNoodle, my problem with that is it ends up saving a bunch of businesses that might have been better off closed.
[05:42:46] <ButterNoodle> *that too
[05:43:01] <BillyZane> owning a business is not a right, its a privilege for the few that are not bad at it, and if you want to be bad at it, that's on you, you can take the loss.
[05:43:20] <BillyZane> i won't cry a single tear for a person who can't adapt
[05:44:03] <BillyZane> this is the best thing that could have happened to us
[05:44:22] <BillyZane> when the body is starving, it eats the older, weaker cells first
[05:44:40] <BillyZane> that's why not eating has been a cure-all for millennia
[05:44:49] <ButterNoodle> I thought it ate the low effort tasty stuff first
[05:44:55] <BillyZane> haha
[05:45:05] <ButterNoodle> because our metabolism is lazy like the rest of us
[05:45:30] <BillyZane> the analogy for the body and the economy is similar. it's the weakest, dumbest, stupidest businesses that die first. the ones that were barely holding on, that shouldn't even exist in the first place
[05:45:54] <BillyZane> the sears and the JC pennies
[05:46:26] <BillyZane> after all this is over, only the strong will survive, and there will be more capital for them, they will grow

[05:49:32] <BillyZane> jessedesu2, hey man
[05:49:39] <BillyZane> jessedesu2, i've actually been wanting to talk to you XD
[05:49:54] <BillyZane> jessedesu2, i don't know many people who would be interested in talking about the F-35
[05:50:43] <BillyZane> jessedesu2, there's some new news on the program, they are cutting back procurement from 1700+ down to like 800 F-35s, increasing funding for NGAD
[05:51:17] <SaladChampion> of the latest block of f-35s?
[05:51:32] <SaladChampion> i.e. most upgraded/advanced versions?
[05:51:34] <BillyZane> SaladChampion, it looks like they're holding off until block IV is available
[05:51:39] <SaladChampion> ok
[05:51:47] <SaladChampion> ah thankyou
[05:51:49] <BillyZane> i can't find much information on this, block I through IV or V
[05:51:58] <BillyZane> it's kinda scattered all over
[05:52:07] <SaladChampion> see I thought I had read somewhere about Block V of F-35s
[05:52:29] <SaladChampion> probably on wikipedia like a week ago when I looked up f-35 and its variants
[05:52:41] <BillyZane> it seems the older versions of the F-35 are already too expensive to upgrade
[05:52:46] <SaladChampion> like my personal favorite, f-35I (israeli version with enhanced something-or-others)
[05:52:52] <SaladChampion> BillyZane: eek!!
[05:53:06] <SaladChampion> BillyZane: now that's unfortunate! why coudln't they plan ahead??
[05:53:24] <BillyZane> they're trying to do some kind of experimental rolling release on the F-35, where it's continually upgraded to the point where the older ones get obsolete very fast
[05:53:47] <SaladChampion> oh
[05:53:53] <SaladChampion> it's prohibitively expensive, that's why, I think
[05:54:00] <SaladChampion> to upgrade some of hte older ones
[05:54:11] <SaladChampion> BillyZane: hmm, ok
[05:54:12] <BillyZane> a lot of it is classified it seems, but they're doing upgrades on the software and hardware
[05:54:17] <SaladChampion> aye
[05:54:18] <jessedesu2> The f-16 is my favorite tho
[05:54:24] <BillyZane> jessedesu2, haha
[05:54:31] <BillyZane> jessedesu2, yeah it was mine too growing up

[05:55:29] <jessedesu2> I wanna go home and sleep

[05:55:42] <SaladChampion> etc.
[05:55:43] <jessedesu2> Tomcruise
[05:55:43] <SaladChampion> all the toms.
[05:55:46] <jessedesu2> Yea
[05:55:53] <SaladChampion> jessedesu2: yeah,
[05:55:54] <BillyZane> tomcruise missile
[05:55:57] <SaladChampion> that and the Lamborghini Countach
[05:56:02] <jessedesu2> Tomahawk
[05:56:11] <SaladChampion> like we all wanted posters of those on our walls as kids
[05:56:16] <SaladChampion> I was born in 1980
[05:56:23] <jessedesu2> 1985
[05:56:24] <SaladChampion> so I was like. 8/9 at the height of this rage
[05:56:29] <SaladChampion> jessedesu2: cool :)
[05:56:32] <SaladChampion> so you knew it too then :)
[05:56:37] <BillyZane> SaladChampion, you know what that reminds me of? i was watching a video of this horribly tacky mansion up for sale that was from the 1980s, and it came with state of the art tech... from the 1980s
[05:56:40] <jessedesu2> Not really
[05:56:46] <SaladChampion> BillyZane: EEEEK hehehehe
[05:57:08] <SaladChampion> BillyZane: you know he 1960s/1980s house layouts, where the kitchen is closed off with walls
[05:57:19] <SaladChampion> today the kitchen is opened to the living room/dining room
[05:57:22] <SaladChampion> that's the style
[05:57:31] <BillyZane> SaladChampion, my parent's house needs to be rebuilt, it's from the 1950s
[05:57:47] <SaladChampion> oh gosh, I bet it's full of small room cells
[05:57:57] <BillyZane> it's the most annoying, most confusing house. the layout is so bad. you walk in to the house and you're immediately in the kitchen
[05:58:17] <SaladChampion> aye
[05:58:18] <SaladChampion> truly
[05:58:31] <BillyZane> where are you suppose to take your shoes off
[05:58:46] <SaladChampion> honestly, I want  like.. a garden in the center of the house
[05:58:47] <SaladChampion> with a bench
[05:58:48] <SaladChampion> and all

[05:59:01] <BillyZane> SaladChampion, i like that idea
[05:59:06] <SaladChampion> also I want a greenouse attached to the side
[05:59:11] <SaladChampion> and also an enclosed porh
[05:59:12] <SaladChampion> porch
[05:59:17] <SaladChampion> BillyZane: yeah? :)
[05:59:25] <SaladChampion> I thought about a pond too but it's like way overkill
[05:59:31] <SaladChampion> once I saw the actual implementations
[05:59:39] <SaladChampion> I also like this concept of a "living wall" in the house
[05:59:42] <SaladChampion> a wall of green
[05:59:55] <BillyZane> it adds to the upkeep of a house, but it would be nice
[05:59:59] <SaladChampion> :)
[06:00:05] <BillyZane> i think things like that are best suited for public spaces, so many people can enjoy them
[06:00:09] <SaladChampion> have you seen this one house in Potomac, MD with a city-scape basement

[06:02:42] <SaladChampion> aheh
[06:02:54] <SaladChampion> well then you'd need security guards to prevent stealing
[06:03:27] <SaladChampion> alos, when would yolu spend time here?  maybne the kids would, because they have more free time
[06:03:30] <SaladChampion> but like I don't see myself using it
[06:03:36] <SaladChampion> as much as I Find it cute
[06:03:51] <BillyZane> there's a place near san diego called julian
[06:03:59] <BillyZane> and their main street reminds me of that

[06:07:18] <BillyZane> i can't help but marvel at the mentality of that basement. it would have been far better suited to build something like that on this main street, share it with people, be human centric, instead of sitting in your basement, in your private main street, devoid of life
[06:08:24] <SaladChampion> BillyZane: very nice (julian)
[06:08:24] <SaladChampion> btw
[06:08:31] <amigojapan> BillyZane: then someone would steal your classic cars
[06:08:31] <SaladChampion> so I like that streetcorner aesthetic
[06:08:38] <BillyZane> SaladChampion, i'm still envious of that basement hahaha
[06:08:39] <SaladChampion> and there are cruise ships that offer that
[06:08:43] <BillyZane> amigojapan, lol
[06:08:44] <SaladChampion> BillyZane: aww :)
[06:08:51] <SaladChampion> amigojapan: hi!!! 
[06:08:59] <BillyZane> SaladChampion, it's beautiful, it's too beautiful to be in a basement
[06:09:03] <amigojapan> Hi SaladChampion 
[06:09:21] <SaladChampion> BillyZane: I know, right? what are they gonna do, just be there 3-4 people at a time?
[06:09:25] <SaladChampion> it feels like a still life, almost
[06:09:36] <SaladChampion> I like the busy street corner motif myself
[06:09:36] <BillyZane> SaladChampion, you could probably impress drunk people at a party
[06:09:42] <BillyZane> SaladChampion, i would go nuts if i went down there
[06:09:51] <SaladChampion> nuts from what? boredom?
[06:09:56] <BillyZane> no hahah
[06:09:56] <SaladChampion> not having anyone to talk with?
[06:09:58] <SaladChampion> oh
[06:10:19] <SaladChampion> oh, you meant to say that you'd use it to its fullest extent
[06:10:20] <SaladChampion> ?
[06:10:24] <BillyZane> ueaj
[06:10:29] <SaladChampion> ahh, cool
[06:10:59] <SaladChampion> also I like the idea that the center of house would have giant skylights
[06:11:00] <SaladChampion> panels even
[06:11:11] <SaladChampion> and the garden-with-a-bench-and-a-pond would be directly below that
[06:12:23] <BillyZane> that would be a great layout
[06:13:07] <BillyZane> SaladChampion, to a certain extend, things that are beautiful get their utility from how many people view them.
[06:13:30] <SaladChampion> aye
[06:13:30] <BillyZane> SaladChampion, or rather, they increase their utility
[06:13:41] <BillyZane> like, a painting sitting in a private office, versus in a museum
[06:13:47] <SaladChampion> agreed.  Stuff to watch out ofr: algae in the pond
[06:13:49] <SaladChampion> and gnats
[06:13:51] <SaladChampion> andstuff like that
[06:13:55] <SaladChampion> and rodents/pests
[06:14:10] <BillyZane> yup
[06:14:35] <BillyZane> maintaining a pond is rather difficult. and if you're the only person living at this place, it might be a lot of hassle for what it provides
[06:15:02] <BillyZane> but if you could open it to the public, where thousands of people can sit there and enjoy it, the total return on investment is substantially higher
[06:16:10] <BillyZane> even if you don't charge people, you can generate a lot of smiles, reduce a lot of stress on the aggregate. i benefit from this all the time, with public beaches, public parks.
[06:19:09] <BillyZane> we have a private swimming pool at my parent's house. how much use do we get out of it?
[06:19:39] <BillyZane> not that much. you can see a map of the neighborhood on google earth. so many pools, hardly any in use
[06:20:22] <BillyZane> the cost of maintaining it. cleaning the filter, adding chlorine, scrubbing the walls
[06:21:04] <BillyZane> if we pool our resources, we could have had a waterpark
[06:22:25] <BillyZane> the model that's better: instead of paying $30,000 for a swimming pool, pay $30 and visit a water park. you'll get bored of it before you break even

[06:44:03] <SaladChampion> amigojapan: have you seen the one with the car display?
[06:44:12] <SaladChampion> as in, a rotating display of cars?
[06:44:46] <amigojapan> No SaladChampion 
[06:45:01] <BillyZane> i would settle for rotating hotwheels

[06:46:17] <SaladChampion> rotating car display
[06:47:52] <BillyZane> SaladChampion, that chandelier is pretty nice
[06:47:57] <SaladChampion> also there is the idea of a turntable right outside the home's garage, so that you can always drive the car facing out: https://www.contemporist.com/garage-design-idea-include-a-car-turntable/

[06:52:35] <BillyZane> amigojapan, listening
[06:52:54] <Jigsy> Heard a noise and it freaked me out.
[06:53:59] <BillyZane> there's too much suffering in this world, to be able to rest easy in a house that big and expensive
[06:54:05] <SaladChampion> amigojapan, can you understand all Japanese now?
[06:54:06] <SaladChampion> fluently>?
[06:54:08] <BillyZane> knowing you could have done something
[06:54:10] <SaladChampion> after so many years there?
[06:54:29] <SaladChampion> <BillyZane> there's too much suffering in this world, to be able to rest easy in a house that big and expensive / <BillyZane> knowing you could have done something <- yes I tend to agree here 
[06:54:34] <SaladChampion> my mom too
[06:54:44] <SaladChampion> we started this trend of looking at these videos together in the morning
[06:54:50] <BillyZane> SaladChampion, yeah?
[06:54:52] <BillyZane> that's nice
[06:55:09] <SaladChampion> sometimes it's just SO oppulant that it makes us wonder *why* folks spend so much money on so much house that they'll barely use all of
[06:55:12] <amigojapan> SaladChampion: there are always obscure things I am still learning
[06:55:32] <SaladChampion> amigojapan: but like, native-level Japanese you have, right?
[06:56:12] <amigojapan> SaladChampion: I think at least close to native. I have been living in Japan for 20 years 
[06:56:15] <BillyZane> SaladChampion, in many ways, we are like those people. for a person living on $1.90 a day, to which there are 700 million in this world, we are like those people in that house. we live a life of luxury
[06:56:50] <BillyZane> SaladChampion, we take for granted the simplest of luxuries, like clean drinking water

[06:59:12] <SaladChampion> MootPoot: aye!!! same.
[06:59:17] <SaladChampion> I got mine after the TP shortage
[06:59:20] <BillyZane> isekaijin, yeah it is possible, but the circumstances are different for different people. in different countries. the funny thing is, these people work very hard, sacrificing everything
[06:59:23] <SaladChampion> but had been planning on doing it for ages
[06:59:32] <BillyZane> isekaijin, they do it because they will not eat, or their family will not have food if they don't

[06:59:52] <isekaijin> wtf
[06:59:59] <BillyZane> isekaijin, people here literally risk being buried alive for $1 a day
[07:00:00] <SaladChampion> oh gosh. burkina faso..
[07:00:02] <isekaijin> The fact that it's a *gold* mine makes it even more offensive.
[07:00:07] <SaladChampion> yeah
[07:00:27] <BillyZane> they breath in dust, their drinking water is polluted with mercury and industrial waste
[07:00:35] <MootPoot> the worst part is- the price paid by the buyers of that output - they literally would not notice if it was a few dollars higher
[07:00:40] <SaladChampion> are there animes that address wealth disparity? Like, besides Grave of the Fireflies?
[07:00:52] <MootPoot> SaladChampion: there is gundam IBO which gets there
[07:00:53] <isekaijin> Oh, right... Mercury and cyanide are used in gold mining.
[07:00:59] <SaladChampion> MootPoot: hmm, ok
[07:00:59] <isekaijin> rip
[07:01:00] <BillyZane> they can't farm because the soil's condition is too poor. who would accept 100 million migrants? europe? they complain with 1 million syrians arrive
[07:01:41] <SaladChampion> oh.. did you guys hear that Russian soldiers diggin up trenches around Chernobyl's nuclear power plant ended up digging up irradiated soil and got radiation sickness
[07:01:52] <isekaijin> BillyZane: The only solution is to fix their place. Obviously you can't let 100 mllion people migrate and expect there not to be violence.
[07:01:54] <BillyZane> SaladChampion, oh that sucks
[07:02:03] <BillyZane> isekaijin, yup
[07:02:12] <SaladChampion> yeah.... and these are f***ing 20-year-old kids they're sending in
[07:02:25] <BillyZane> SaladChampion, i really care about this cause
[07:02:41] <SaladChampion> BillyZane: what do you mean
[07:02:56] <BillyZane> i've read a lot about industrialization, how a country can go from this level of poverty to high speed internet and kpop
[07:03:04] <amigojapan> Isekaijinn And just in case you wonder why that don't steal some gold, most folks mines only have gold ore, not actual gold
[07:03:17] <amigojapan> They*
[07:03:21] <isekaijin> SaladChampion: Yeah, it became clear that the army that Russia sent consisted mostly of conscripts who had no fucking idea what they are doing.
[07:03:26] <isekaijin> amigojapan: Yeah, of course.
[07:03:49] <isekaijin> amigojapan: Gold has to be refined just like any other metal.
[07:03:57] <amigojapan> Yup
[07:04:04] <BillyZane> SaladChampion, it's very impossible to bring these people out of poverty, the solution is to integrate them in to the global economy in a meaningful way. right now they're exporting gold, but it's highly dangerous work, and the are not generating enough value to uplift themselves and their country
[07:04:05] <isekaijin> Even though it's chemically inert.
[07:04:09] <isekaijin> Well, mostly inert.
[07:04:14] <BillyZane> *very possible
[07:05:26] <isekaijin> BillyZane: How do you integrate them into the global economy if they can't be competitive, though?
[07:06:26] <SaladChampion> BillyZane, isekaijin: aye (to both your points)
[07:06:52] <BillyZane> isekaijin, it's not necessarily their job to figure that out, but someone has to think of a way to enterprise. if you can pay them $5 or even $3 a day, it would be a step towards a better future for their children
[07:06:59] <SaladChampion> BillyZane: automatic mining robots will remove that as a job for these people, you think?
[07:07:07] <SaladChampion> like sending Spot dogs
[07:07:10] <SaladChampion> with scoops?
[07:07:25] <SaladChampion> *Boston Dynamics Spot robo-dogs

[07:08:40] <BillyZane> but these people have not hit the industrial revolution
[07:08:46] <BillyZane> they're not using machine tools
[07:09:01] <BillyZane> they need to be able to increase their productivity
[07:09:24] <BillyZane> but, yeah, definitely using machines to dig for gold, instead of hand tools
[07:09:38] <amigojapan> And replacing them with robots Will just take away the little they earn
[07:09:44] <SaladChampion> yeah
[07:09:55] <BillyZane> not a spot, but a bulldozer and a gold refinery, that can do it at scale
[07:09:57] <SaladChampion> though it will remove them from threats of bodily harm
[07:10:03] <SaladChampion> of working in a tunnel or in a mine shaft
[07:10:20] <SaladChampion> <BillyZane> not a spot, but a bulldozer and a gold refinery, that can do it at scale <- strip-mining? sure
[07:10:27] <isekaijin> BillyZane: Who's gonna pay for the refining plant?
[07:10:45] <isekaijin> BillyZane: The ones buying the gold ore have absolutely no interest in that.
[07:10:58] <BillyZane> isekaijin, the thing is, burkina faso already has industrial gold mining
[07:11:00] <isekaijin> They'd rather do the refining themselves, give jobs to their own people.
[07:11:20] <isekaijin> Ah.
[07:11:23] <BillyZane> isekaijin, what these people are doing is operating in a gold mine with a license, the government is allowing people to do this
[07:11:50] <BillyZane> the solution would be to have safety regulations, like we have in the US
[07:12:10] <BillyZane> but, what it really needs is investment
[07:12:14] <isekaijin> Regulations are useful if they can be enforced.

[07:21:04] <amigojapan> SaladChampion: for me pee often comes out of hte toilet whne I sit and pee, no matter how careful I am, that is hwy I rather stand and pee
[07:21:06] <SaladChampion> <isekaijin> amigojapan: Oh, I meant the talk about bidets and assholes. <- ur statement brings forth memories of the "dicks, pussies and assholes" speech from Team America
[07:21:13] <BillyZane> SaladChampion, the guy who does it said it himself, he would be growing his food if he could, but the soil is poor, so you have to buy fertilizer. when japan and europe was flattened after WW2, there was marshall plan money to rebuild. africa got devastated by colonization, it never got a marshall plan, it never got investment.

[09:08:22] <MootPoot> wont have nvidia shit drivers
[09:08:29] <MootPoot> or amd unreliability
[09:09:18] <Sapphirus> That's if they can make something faster than a GTX 250
[09:09:27] <MootPoot> its intel
[09:09:36] <MootPoot> not some random chinese firm
[09:09:49] <MootPoot> at the worst I would expect it to be like gtx 9xx tier
[09:10:06] <Sapphirus> You also have to take in consideration that this is Intel. Their iGPUs perform far worse than an AMD APU.
[09:10:44] <MootPoot> yeah, I'm not expecting world shattering performance or anything - I'm happy if they can make gtx 1060 class cards
[09:11:10] <Sapphirus> That'll be surprising if they can even pull that off.
[09:11:32] <MootPoot> their gpu is going to have 22 something billion transistors
[09:11:45] <MootPoot> they'll pull it off
[09:11:57] <Sapphirus> Transistor count doesn't mean shit
[09:12:06] <MootPoot> well, they also never really even cared about gpu power that much

[09:15:12] <MootPoot> I mean, their numbers are probably inflated, dont get me wrong
[09:15:19] <MootPoot> but I doubt they are more then 20% off
[09:15:52] <Sapphirus> I'll give it a couple generations before I care, because those numbers don't look great.
[09:15:53] <MootPoot> and even reducing those numbers by 20%..I'm happy with that - this is arc 3 being able to do 1080p 60 or 1080p ...the lowest end version

[09:16:21] <Sapphirus> Something that can outperform my GTX 980
[09:16:27] <Sapphirus> a card from over 6 years ago
[09:16:55] <MootPoot> yeah, these are arc 3 units limited to like 20w power draw
[09:17:02] <MootPoot> wait for arc 5 or 7
[09:17:10] <Sapphirus> Do they not want to show off their higher-end numbers?
[09:17:20] <MootPoot> they are releasing bottom up afaik
[09:17:42] <Sapphirus> I care more about 1440p-4k numbers
[09:18:06] <Sapphirus> Can they compete at least nominally with the AMD and Nvidia at those resolutions?
[09:18:16] <Sapphirus> If not, then.. rip
[09:18:37] <MootPoot> no, I dont think they will
[09:18:49] <MootPoot> but here's the catch...you will be able to go out and buy an arc gpu
[09:18:56] <Sapphirus> That's not enticing.
[09:19:01] <MootPoot> vs nothing?
[09:19:06] <MootPoot> you'd rather have nothing?
[09:19:23] <Sapphirus> I have something that costs over 50% of what I paid for it 7 years ago on the used market.
[09:19:44] <Sapphirus> I'm fine waiting until AMD and Nvidia get their shit together.
[09:19:48] <MootPoot> I mean, I'm not going to rush out and buy one either
[09:19:53] <MootPoot> I have my rtx 3080
[09:20:01] <MootPoot> but for the lower end market this is a godsend
[09:20:29] <Sapphirus> Prices of 3080s are lower every time I look on newegg
[09:20:38] <Sapphirus> C$1400 now
[09:20:46] <MootPoot> oh, not bad 
[09:20:58] <MootPoot> I got mine at MSRP luckily enough
[09:21:18] <Sapphirus> I don't want to pay far above MSRP
[09:21:41] <MootPoot> seems like the base floor is about 1500cad now
[09:21:55] <MootPoot> the 1400 cards for some reason charge 50 dollars on shipping
[09:21:58] <MootPoot> then add tax

[09:25:32] <MootPoot> it was like 380 or something
[09:25:45] <Sapphirus> Fact that my 980 can still stand on its own is brilliant

[09:31:46] <MootPoot> one thing I have learned though is that more cores are more better
[09:32:01] <MootPoot> a 10 year old cpu with a lot of cores is still useful
[09:32:10] <Sapphirus> They don't scale infinitely, though, and you're still bottlenecked by the fastest core.
[09:32:12] <MootPoot> vs a 8 year one that is only quad
[09:32:49] <MootPoot> usually for running stuff having a lot of cores will just help you out
[09:32:59] <Sapphirus> That's why I was able to get away with a i7 6800k for years. 
[09:33:03] <MootPoot> my amd APU from 2011 is a POS
[09:33:10] <MootPoot> even though its a quad
[09:33:17] <Sapphirus> AMD's stuff from 2011 in general is garbage
[09:33:37] <MootPoot> but the intel xeon from the same year , two cpus with 6 cores each
[09:33:39] <MootPoot> works like a charm
[09:33:48] <MootPoot> its not fast..but it holds its own
[09:33:56] <Sapphirus> I don't see a good reason in hoarding all of that hardware.
[09:34:04] <MootPoot> I dont really have a lot

[09:38:48] <MootPoot> well, that's what the server is for

[09:39:48] <MootPoot> easier to manage
[09:39:53] <MootPoot> not needed, sure
[09:40:45] <Sapphirus> I don't think it's more difficult to manage.
[09:41:11] <Sapphirus> Workflow between dedicated hypervisors and non-dedicated can essentially be the same.
[09:41:28] <MootPoot> say if I have just one system, and a kernel update comes in - now all those VM's are down
[09:41:38] <MootPoot> as I restart and bring it back up
[09:41:48] <MootPoot> if something fails I'm completely out of a computer 
[09:41:58] <Sapphirus> That's never happened to me.
[09:42:19] <MootPoot> last job was pretty clear = if I miss work due to my own hardware issues then I dont get paid for that day
[09:42:34] <Sapphirus> Then get a cheap laptop for work lol
[09:42:41] <MootPoot> ^
[09:42:46] <Sapphirus> That's the only exception I think could make.

[09:52:57] <ButterNoodle> xrdp
[09:52:58] <mixfix41> tigervnc is nice although entirely not so straight forward
[09:52:59] <ButterNoodle> ez
[09:53:05] <mixfix41> server side
[09:53:08] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: what distro?
[09:54:08] <ButterNoodle> I switched over to xrdp for remote terminal, and still use vnc/tigervnc to connect to "real" desktops
[09:54:26] <ButterNoodle> ubuntu xrdp package works out of the box.. arch needs a lil help
[09:54:27] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: its bcos arch script 
[09:54:39] <MootPoot> I just installed any desk on it from yay
[09:54:56] <ButterNoodle> xrdp xorgxrdp from aur
[09:55:16] * MootPoot adds that to his arch notes 
[09:55:29] <mixfix41> x11vnc works
[09:55:43] <ButterNoodle> and pulseaudio-module-xrdp if u want sound
[09:55:46] <mixfix41> as a mirror image sometimes it fixes the brightness
[09:56:03] <mixfix41> if the lcd isnt that great
[09:56:05] <ButterNoodle> vnc is clear txt
[09:56:10] <ButterNoodle> wrap it in xrdp
[09:56:26] <ButterNoodle> then u can connect from windows :)
[09:56:27] <mixfix41> oh i dont do it remotely good idea
[09:56:50] <ButterNoodle> nothing wrong w vnc.. great for connecting to the real desktop
[09:56:58] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: but anydesk has the pinch function and many other functions which makes it nice on tablets 
[09:57:13] <ButterNoodle> but wrap it in xrdp, or at least ssl tunnel it over ssh
[09:57:35] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: thats client side.. there are good rdp/vnc clients on android
[09:57:48] <amigojapan> Alright
[09:57:53] <ButterNoodle> rdclient is good

[11:19:16] <Zoidberg> not an 80s anime
[11:19:39] <amigojapan> Yeah probably 70s
[11:19:44] <amigojapan> Let me search
[11:19:57] <Zoidberg> there were couple of series and one was in 80s and another in 70

[11:23:19] <Zoidberg> that's odd amigojapan 
[11:23:33] <Zoidberg> you're not supposed to put milk in earl grey
[11:23:55] <Zoidberg> amigojapan: is it milk or cream?
[11:24:11] <MootPoot> I have shaved
[11:24:14] <MootPoot> now should I fap or code
[11:24:22] <amigojapan> Zoidberg: actually it is something called "fresh"
[11:24:26] <MootPoot> fresh fap
[11:25:12] <Zoidberg> MootPoot: don't fap for couple of days, use the fap power to code
[11:25:26] <MootPoot> that's not how it works for me
[11:25:36] <MootPoot> if I dont fap I cant concentrate on anything
[11:25:38] <Zoidberg> amigojapan: fresh? what's that?
[11:25:57] <Zoidberg> lol, no way
[11:26:05] <amigojapan> Zoidberg: it artificial cream that Japan invented

[12:09:34] <amigojapan> Yup
[12:10:53] <amigojapan> Zoidberg except functional characters like emperor jinmu 
[12:11:03] <amigojapan> Fictional*
[12:12:33] <Zoidberg> yeah, fictional 
[12:12:58] <amigojapan> MootPoot: how about inventing an iot device that you hook up to an electric device like an AC and it tells you how much money it is costing?
[12:13:19] <MootPoot> wireless smart plug power meters already exist
[12:13:56] <amigojapan> MootPoot: do they say how much money you have spent on them?
[12:14:02] <MootPoot> yes
[12:14:13] <amigojapan> Ah ok then nevermind
[12:14:19] <MootPoot> you just input how much money per kwh you pay
[12:14:35] <amigojapan> I see
[12:14:47] <MootPoot> although I dont know if there are any ones which handle varying rates
[12:14:49] <MootPoot> only flat ones
[12:15:57] <amigojapan> MootPoot: one thing that is suspicious is that I only use gas for heating the bath water, yet the gas free varies widely between 25 to 40 dollars per month
[12:16:35] <Sapphirus> Have you checked your usage and the rate to see if there's any discrepancy?
[12:16:35] <MootPoot> yes, that's probably because you dont have fixed pricing for gas
[12:16:50] <Sapphirus> ^
[12:17:25] <MootPoot> idk about japan but you usually pay less if you have a fixed price contract for gas/electricity for 2-3 years
[12:17:27] <Sapphirus> If there's one thing that doesn't suck about Canada, it's cheap electricity and natgas
[12:17:40] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: I asked the gas collector guy and he said "it varies a lot even with small changes
[12:17:48] <Zoidberg> and also healthcare
[12:17:52] <MootPoot> last I checked the fixed rate here is like 7c per kwh but the varying rate is like 14 atm
[12:18:20] <amigojapan> I see MootPoot that makes sense

[12:27:06] <Sapphirus> Nah, but I did out of pure curiosity, because it was freezing here.
[12:27:17] <Sapphirus> Happened to be that Alberta was very warm that day.

[12:33:34] <MootPoot> those lucky peeps in ON or BC get federal and provincal
[12:33:43] <emmeka> ON used to have FIT for solar but the tories abolished it and also pretty much all green homes initiatives.
[12:33:59] <emmeka> but Ontario does have a lot of existing FIT contracts with people who put up solar before
[12:35:51] <emmeka> MootPoot I've considered it a few times, my house faces south and to the south there is nothing but open field for miles with no obstruction of light, so I could put up rooftop solar pretty easily
[12:35:59] <Zoidberg> don't you people have quite long winters?
[12:36:10] <Zoidberg> is it worth the cost of solar?
[12:36:17] <emmeka> yes. solar panels still work in winter. albeit not as well.
[12:36:23] <MootPoot> in the 30+ year timeframe yes Zoidberg 
[12:36:33] <MootPoot> afaik most people make it back in 15

[12:54:25] <MootPoot> I use about 900

[12:57:57] <amigojapan> emmeka: maybe the ones that take heat from under ground
[12:58:01] <MootPoot> alright - seems like my home uses like 1200 kWh

[13:02:14] <emmeka> Chicago is significantly milder in climate that here, or where MootPoot lives. it borders the southernmost point of the great lakes
[13:02:21] <emmeka> which are pretty good at moderating climate

[13:20:17] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: I get mad nostalgia from it
[13:20:30] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: reminds me of another world...
[13:20:54] <DunceCotus> it seems almost incongruous with this current configuration (and its history)
[13:20:54] <amigojapan> The movie I did not like back then was "hackers"maybe I should try watching it again
[13:21:23] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: terrible film
[13:21:31] <amigojapan> I see
[13:21:34] <DunceCotus> I never saw it
[13:21:38] <DunceCotus> but I know its terrible
[13:21:40] <amigojapan> Oh
[13:21:59] <DunceCotus> I have a feeling its the source of all those hackers-in-film tropes
[13:22:06] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I was expecting to see something real
[13:22:36] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: films like Lawnmower Man, Hackers..
[13:22:42] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: have not aged well at all
[13:22:43] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: I think it's one of these movies that you watch ironically
[13:22:47] <MootPoot> turned off my exsi server for now
[13:22:50] <MootPoot> wasen't really using it 
[13:22:58] <amigojapan> Hi KatrinValerie 
[13:23:03] <MootPoot> I guess the only other thing that is idle is my NAS box but I can't turn that off
[13:23:45] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I have my Nas off except when I use it too 
[13:24:19] <KatrinValerie> The audience score on rotten tomatoes says 68% and the tomatometer 31%
[13:24:49] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: what do those scores mean again?
[13:25:15] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: is that like thumbs up and thumbs down?
[13:25:26] <KatrinValerie> So the mean is pretty average
[13:25:32] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: higher is better
[13:25:39] <amigojapan> Oh
[13:25:54] <KatrinValerie> I think it's supposed to be audience approval percentage idk rly
[13:26:11] <KatrinValerie> I think the choice of percent is arbitary
[13:26:12] <amigojapan> I see
[13:27:13] <KatrinValerie> It's almost 11am, I should wake up my gf probably
[13:27:59] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: I remember their commuters have customized animated boot up screens, we don't even have that now
[13:28:03] <KatrinValerie> I should wake up both actually, but one is in austria and her phone is probably not turned on XD
[13:28:22] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: That's from the modding scene
[13:28:30] <KatrinValerie> I used to mod my windows XP installation
[13:28:53] <KatrinValerie> There are many 3rd party explorer skins, it was even possible to replace explorer.exe with something else
[13:29:02] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: they had no bios information at all
[13:29:12] <KatrinValerie> a custom boot splash is not uncommon
[13:29:32] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: animated?
[13:29:43] <KatrinValerie> sure, during the OS boot stage
[13:30:06] <KatrinValerie> depending on the firmware, it's also possible during initalisation and entering the bios
[13:30:08] <amigojapan> This was during the whole boot time
[13:30:27] <KatrinValerie> Modding can go really deep
[13:30:42] <KatrinValerie> I used to mod my bios, so I could activate windows with an OEM key.
[13:30:50] <amigojapan> That was pretty unrealistic for 1995
[13:31:13] <KatrinValerie> Some bios modders love to put animations in their work
[13:31:28] <MootPoot> cum splash
[13:31:29] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: you just weren't in the scene back then I guess
[13:31:48] <KatrinValerie> This is actually a heritage from the demo scene that predates the IBM PC
[13:32:21] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: alright, that is possible
[13:32:46] <KatrinValerie> And these are black hats from all I can tell, just watched the trailer xD
[13:32:55] <KatrinValerie> Black hat culture is different
[13:32:59] <KatrinValerie> From FOSS culture
[13:33:02] <amigojapan> I better rewatched the movie to give it a good look thru modern eyes 
[13:33:03] <KatrinValerie> Very very different
[13:33:35] <KatrinValerie> We are talking about criminals here, it's all about posing and internet points (street cred but online)
[13:34:09] <KatrinValerie> meow
[13:34:24] <KatrinValerie> I wasn't involved in any illegal activities at all meow
[13:34:49] <KatrinValerie> Mr CIA, I am just a harmless cat, believe me pls! 
[13:34:54] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: I downloaded warez back then
[13:35:35] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: who did not? but for quite some time it was a legal grey area
[13:35:56] <amigojapan> Ok
[13:36:15] <KatrinValerie> idk when private copying became illegal here
[13:36:33] <KatrinValerie> And it still is not illegal for backup purposes
[13:36:46] <amigojapan> I see 
[13:41:57] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: when I was like 14, I spent the summer in NYC and when I got back to Mexico I was kidding to my mom ,I said "I did something illegal in the internet, and someone from the FBI came and took my modem" my mom believed it and kept on telling other people that for years to come lol

[14:18:18] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: Interesting premise too; Imagine if everyone collectively lost their memories 40 years ago
[14:18:38] <amigojapan> I can imagine
[14:19:17] <amigojapan> Only older people would have been alive anyway
[14:19:58] <amigojapan> At least like 50 or 60yo would be around from that time
[14:20:10] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: They make good use of that too. Their is this semi-romance episode, where the philosophical hook is, that (assuming you are married ) if both you and your wife lost your memories, would you fall in love again?
[14:21:09] <Kill-Animals> oh and the music. The piano medleys, the jazz, and the combat music are excellent. More memorable that Cowboy Bebop

[14:24:04] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: it says 23 episodes. Is that one or two seasons?

[14:42:08] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: so the cartoon network took over an anime and animated it American style?
[14:43:30] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: Not exactly. The style remained consistent throughout. The animation methods changed drastically. I think they used something called auto-color or cell shading -- I forget what. But it looks bad.
[14:43:31] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: sounds sketchy, pun intended 
[14:45:21] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: There was also some weird... japanese stereotypes put into an episode, with like donkey teeth expressions, and them working for some mecha company or something. It was very weird.
[14:49:14] <amigojapan> I see Kill-Animals 
[14:49:44] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: you said there is a religious plot to it?
[14:51:16] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: I look for christian appropriate anime; The Big O is the best candidate, because it is not degenerate, and it does acknowledge christianity as part of its lore. Christmas is called "Heavens Day", but not because they don't want to say christmas, but because everyone lost their collective memories
[14:51:50] <Kill-Animals> Also its chrismas episode is the best I have ever seen from an anime. I'll be playing it for my nephews next time I visit on the holidays
[14:52:17] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: I know Christians that don't want to say merry Christmas
[14:52:25] <Kill-Animals> At the end, they make a direct reference to Jesus Christ.

[14:55:43] <amigojapan> Yup KatrinValerie 
[14:56:05] <Kill-Animals> KatrinValerie: He doesnt say that, and its also very sick to teach women to abandon their children from their womb so they can go work for a corporation.
[14:56:23] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: something about yeast or sourdough, depending on the translation. Translations differ wildly
[14:56:59] <Kill-Animals> KatrinValerie: Are you christian?
[14:57:11] <KatrinValerie> And the bible does not refer to gay people when it talks about sodomites either
[14:57:31] <amigojapan> 1 Timothy 2:12 " NIV: "I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man; she must be silent." CEV: "They should be silent and not be allowed to teach or to tell men what to do."
[14:57:46] <Kill-Animals> KatrinValerie: It calls gay men abombinations, right before it says that women should not have sex with animals.
[14:57:47] <KatrinValerie> The part about men shouldn't sleep with men like they do with women was actually about not raping men as a sign of power basically
[14:57:59] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: based!
[14:58:20] <KatrinValerie> From what I know the histroical jesus actually called for raping neither men nor women 
[14:58:21] <Kill-Animals> KatrinValerie: No its not. No Orthodox Jew would ever read it like that.
[14:58:34] <Kill-Animals> KatrinValerie: Are you a christian?

[14:59:29] <KatrinValerie> At least in the sense that I do not recognize any organised form of religion as true
[14:59:36] <Kill-Animals> KatrinValerie: Okay figured as much. Don't teach what you do not believe or invest in to others. Its offensive.
[14:59:56] <KatrinValerie> Kill-Animals: I was raised christian
[15:00:15] <Kill-Animals> KatrinValerie: Doesnt matter. Trying to be subversive is sick and poor form.
[15:00:24] <Kill-Animals> Be honest to your own beliefs.
[15:00:52] <KatrinValerie> I am honest in that I do believe that the bible never meant to prohibit gay sex as we see it today.
[15:01:04] <KatrinValerie> There wasn't even that kind of concept back then
[15:01:45] <Kill-Animals> KatrinValerie: Let me ask you a question then. You do believe in the bible, but interpret it differently, is what you are saying?
[15:02:01] <KatrinValerie> Historic societies were very different from ours, I only put things into a historical perspective and say why I think that reading the bible like that is just wrong.
[15:02:30] <KatrinValerie> Kill-Animals: I do not believe in the words of the bible in the literal sense, no.
[15:02:46] <KatrinValerie> And I think it has some useful teachings in it and some that aren't so useful.
[15:02:52] <Kill-Animals> KatrinValerie: I didnt ask in the literal sense. I said you interpret it differently.
[15:03:45] <Kill-Animals> Even orthodox Jews don't believe in the literal written word. They have a concept called an oral tradition, which is for interpreting it differently. For example, Jews wont attest to "An eye for an Eye" as literal.
[15:03:49] <KatrinValerie> I am confused by your wording. Yes the bible exists? And yes I interpret it differently than most christian churches.
[15:04:10] <Kill-Animals> KatrinValerie: Okay and it is a guiding force in your life?
[15:04:18] <KatrinValerie> No
[15:04:29] <Kill-Animals> ...? 
[15:04:56] <Kill-Animals> Then why are you hung up on how other people read it? You dont take any of it seriously, not even from your differently skewed interpretation
[15:04:57] <KatrinValerie> I base my moral and ethics on logical reasoning mostly
[15:05:05] * MootPoot is making vegetable broth
[15:05:07] <KatrinValerie> I do take it very seriously
[15:05:38] <KatrinValerie> Religion is a driving force for many peoples lives, so how these texts are interpreted in modern society does directly impact my life.
[15:05:40] <Kill-Animals> No you are just playing with words. If you took it seriously, it would guide you in your life.
[15:05:43] <KatrinValerie> And others
[15:06:02] <KatrinValerie> Ignoring bigotry would be dangerous
[15:06:13] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: why does it matter what the Bible taught? It taught many messed up things. One more messed up thing does not surprise me
[15:06:16] <KatrinValerie> Religion is being weaponized way too often.
[15:06:16] <Kill-Animals> KatrinValerie: Yeah its a euphamism for you being a subversive lowlife.
[15:06:21] <MootPoot> I blended some carrots
[15:06:54] <amigojapan> MootPoot: officially became a blender
[15:07:03] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: it matters because we need to highlight where these opinions come from, so that people who want to stick to their belief can adapt to the times anyways.
[15:07:04] <Kill-Animals> KatrinValerie: You believe yourself to be a good person?
[15:07:16] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: and theologists are doing just that
[15:07:20] <KatrinValerie> Kill-Animals: no
[15:07:53] <Kill-Animals> KatrinValerie: Interesting. Why arent you good?
[15:07:59] <KatrinValerie> But I attempt to
[15:08:15] <MootPoot> my blender has a tower of blades so it works as a food processor too
[15:08:17] <KatrinValerie> Because I am obviously not perfect
[15:08:19] <amigojapan> Good and evil is subjective anyway
[15:08:21] <MootPoot> might blend cheese later
[15:08:35] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: In the secular sense, correct.
[15:08:45] <KatrinValerie> mhm
[15:09:18] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: it is always tied to the moral framework you apply
[15:09:18] <Kill-Animals> KatrinValerie: Why do you permit your own bigotry against religion? 
[15:09:28] <KatrinValerie> And they are never perfect
[15:09:51] <KatrinValerie> Kill-Animals: how am I bigotted against religion?
[15:10:02] <Kill-Animals> KatrinValerie: "Perfect" << Its like what does that even mean absent a concept of perfection?
[15:10:20] <KatrinValerie> That is exactly the problem
[15:10:29] <KatrinValerie> You cannot properly define good and perfect
[15:10:49] <Kill-Animals> KatrinValerie: You call it bigotted for one. You reject all its teachings while not even believing in it. You are subversive and underhanded, and finally you don't respect it.
[15:11:04] <KatrinValerie> Also it is very obvious that human beings are quite flawed, it would be narcissistic to belive I was somehow less flawed than others.
[15:11:06] <Kill-Animals> KatrinValerie: I can define it as God. Thats easy.

If you want to talk about bigotry and narcicism; that sort of exercise is a prime example.

[15:29:21] <KatrinValerie> I don't think that's okay to say anywhere really

[15:29:52] <Kill-Animals> yes you did

[16:56:42] <bxgelsan> i
[16:56:52] <bxgelsan> when im in my right mind, im amazing at making connections.
[16:57:01] <bxgelsan> ie. connecting one info to another

[16:57:35] <Kill-Animals> bxgelsan: Yeah I find that too, or at least, people say that I am constnatnly making connections they don't understand how it could be relevant. 
[16:57:49] <bxgelsan> Kill-Animals: i was offered a job by feds when i was 15 after having my comp seized. "when you turn 18, come back, i may have something for you."
[16:57:59] <bxgelsan> i never came back. against my morals.
[16:58:14] <Kill-Animals> bxgelsan: woah thats way beyond anything ive accomplished. Thats awesome
[16:58:32] <bxgelsan> Kill-Animals: thats not an accomplishment, my accomplishments im proud of i never talk about.
[16:58:53] <Kill-Animals> bxgelsan: Are you disagreeable? Or Agreeable?
[16:59:08] <bxgelsan> Kill-Animals: depends on the situation
[16:59:25] <bxgelsan> if i need to be agreeable for the sake of safety
[16:59:26] <bxgelsan> sure
[16:59:27] <Kill-Animals> mm. And you are pretty open minded right? You'll listen to any argument, even contrarian ones?
[16:59:54] <bxgelsan> Kill-Animals: ive studied communities that are polar opposites and tried to be unbiased
[17:00:16] <bxgelsan> Kill-Animals: i dont like to have arguments and shit, but discussions are different.
[17:00:19] <Kill-Animals> I don't think its worth trying to be unbiased tbqh. 
[17:00:42] <bxgelsan> Kill-Animals: its important to try to seperate yourself from the work, at least for me.
[17:00:57] <bxgelsan> i find when im thinking with my brain and not emotions i come to better conclusions.
[17:01:17] <Kill-Animals> bxgelsan: Do you strongly advocate anthing beyond much of a shadow of a doubt? Sometimes that can be difficult for open people.
[17:01:54] <Kill-Animals> bxgelsan: I took some advice a few years back that stated that men should not have emotions, period. 
[17:01:59] <bxgelsan> Kill-Animals: to define what i may have been at some point i did do a degree of "Hacktivism" aka activism and hacking combined.
[17:02:09] <bxgelsan> Kill-Animals: bad advice.
[17:02:35] <bxgelsan> ive had that advice. now i'm a woman.
[17:02:41] <bxgelsan> strange world :p
[17:02:43] <Kill-Animals> bxgelsan: Have you tried it in the same context that I did? The advice is coupled with the idea that all thoughts are lies, and to stop listening ot them.
[17:03:07] <Kill-Animals> bxgelsan: Wait you are a woman? Or trans?
[17:03:59] <Kill-Animals> ping am I offline?
[17:04:01] <Kill-Animals> nope
[17:04:09] <bxgelsan> moving on to the other question. the concept of what we think is false, is true and false, starting at birth, once you hit the schools.
[17:04:14] <bxgelsan> you get shaped and modeled by society.
[17:04:23] * Kill-Animals moves on 
[17:04:30] <bxgelsan> psychologically. 
[17:05:33] <Kill-Animals> Well I can speak for myself on the matter. People usually respond to the notion that emotions are what makes one human, and that its "conventional to tell men to not be emotional" -- I tend to think the opposite is conventional.
[17:05:51] <Kill-Animals> Men are encouraged to be emotional -- men are raised to be women in effect.
[17:06:01] <bxgelsan> huh
[17:06:17] <bxgelsan> i was raised differently. keep everything inside. tell no one.
[17:06:30] <bxgelsan> show no emotion.
[17:06:36] <bxgelsan> stop crying. that shit.
[17:07:01] <Kill-Animals> bxgelsan: Interesting. I would broadly agree to that, but I also have to examine what exactly that meant
[17:07:31] <Kill-Animals> bxgelsan: Some people think that, "Anger" is a masculine trait, and that "Anger" is acceptable, but I would classify that as emotion.
[17:07:34] <bxgelsan> Kill-Animals: yeah, not getting deep into my growing up. dont mind talking. some info stays private.
[17:07:43] <bxgelsan> anger is an emotion
[17:07:47] <Kill-Animals> bxgelsan: Totally fine!
[17:07:48] <bxgelsan> its not masc or fem
[17:08:04] <Kill-Animals> I argue that its feminine. 
[17:08:11] <bxgelsan> i argue that its neither.
[17:08:43] <Kill-Animals> Well Ill let you make your case first. What is a man? In the masculine sense, not the biological sense. 
[17:09:26] <DunceCotus> what maketh a man
[17:09:42] <bxgelsan> Kill-Animals: i cant answer that question in a proper manner, i have a deep rooted hatred of men in general for a long time.
[17:09:43] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: Shoot. 
[17:10:00] <Kill-Animals> bxgelsan: Be biased. I dont care.
[17:10:24] <Kill-Animals> or how about this: Define masculine evil, and if you want, also define feminine evil. 
[17:10:26] <bxgelsan> Kill-Animals: nah, its going to be based on emotion.
[17:10:59] <DunceCotus> bxgelsan: aren't you a men in general?
[17:11:02] <Kill-Animals> bxgelsan: Its up to you. I don't think bias is an argument against a person. It is only an insight after the fact.

[17:28:02] <Sadale> MootPoot, so, I pooped in the toilet of my workplace. And it couldn't get flushed away. :(
[17:28:27] <MootPoot> chad move
[17:28:28] <Sadale> MootPoot, I flushed twice and it was still there. Then I took a video of its flushing on its third time. Just as expected, it was still there. I ended up removing it using paper towel.
[17:28:46] <Sadale> MootPoot, If you want the vid tho I could show you. :P
[17:28:49] <MootPoot> no thanks
[17:28:50] <MootPoot> lol

[17:28:54] <MootPoot> why did you take a video anyways
[17:28:58] <Sadale> Why not? :P

[17:50:42] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: I've only found stuff that sounds nothing like it.. except for them sampling the same original song
[17:50:59] <DunceCotus> I can't remember the fucking name of that song I listened to either, or the artist
[17:51:05] <DunceCotus> but it came on Spotify I'm sure of it
[17:51:25] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: It's SCRUBBED
[17:51:56] <DunceCotus> either that or I've created a false memory of an awesome song out of a mediocre song I've just listened to
[17:52:17] <DunceCotus> but dammit that song had weight.. its tied to a moment in time for me

[18:11:01] <analoq> still boggles my mind how you find models left and right lol
[18:11:06] <analoq> you must be some kind of girl magnet

[18:13:54] <analoq> and actually finding replacement parts
[18:14:00] <analoq> as mentioned earlier
[18:14:03] <amigojapan> Yeah
[18:14:11] <amigojapan> I agree
[18:14:25] <Sadale> And the quality of the battery itself. They could make it replacable while swapping the good battery with the worse ones so that they could make the money back from selling the batteries
[18:14:41] <Sadale> just like inkjet printer ink
[18:14:41] <analoq> the hardest thing i ever fixed was my mechanical watch. after that i laugh at electronics lol
[18:15:27] <amigojapan> Not everyone is as dexterous as you analoq

[18:20:45] <amigojapan> analoq: is that the name of the standard iPhone charging cable?
[18:20:54] <analoq> i think so yes

[18:21:27] <analoq> :o what breaks?
[18:21:37] <amigojapan> The connector
[18:21:39] <analoq> do you break off the part that goes inside the plug?

[18:22:20] <analoq> but odd, why would it break easier than a super thin sheet metal plug that the usb3.x connector uses
[18:22:53] <amigojapan> Dunno. My android connector has never broken
[18:22:55] <analoq> i think it's better because it has less sharp corner/ creases etc.

[18:42:32] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: the question is what is producing the reality of your doing that
[18:42:52] <ButterNoodle> just some psudo Christianity - a la carte
[18:42:54] <Zoidberg> yo ButterNoodle 
[18:43:02] <ButterNoodle> waddup Zoidberg!
[18:43:07] <Sadale> Sapphirus, I could print one tho. But it'd take hours to print. And it's gonna raise suspicion.
[18:43:14] * Sadale has got a 3D printer
[18:43:23] <Sapphirus> Buy one online?
[18:43:28] <ButterNoodle> can we 3d print onaholes?
[18:43:33] <DunceCotus> ButterNoodle: well I'm not suggesting Christianity
[18:43:37] <Sadale> I've already printed a cylinder for storing my current sex toys. Another container would be very suspicious
[18:43:42] <DunceCotus> just that Jesus had some insights maybe
[18:43:45] <ButterNoodle> jesus is the basis of Christianity 
[18:43:48] <Sadale> ButterNoodle, probably not because you can't print flexible material easily
[18:43:52] <DunceCotus> its not the whole picture imo
[18:43:56] <Sadale> Unless you've got those specialized high-end printer tho
[18:44:02] <DunceCotus> its just perhaps a nomadic line of flight
[18:44:03] <Zoidberg> ButterNoodle: I'm rewriting my story
[18:44:10] <bxgelsan> Sadale: how are you
[18:44:10] <Zoidberg> ButterNoodle: just came home
[18:44:16] <ButterNoodle> woah Zoidberg.. thats a serious undertaking
[18:44:21] <analoq> Sadale: im sure with enough pressure abs will be somewhat flexible :D
[18:44:25] <ButterNoodle> Sadale: how $$$?
[18:44:28] <Sadale> ButterNoodle, Actually I think a better way to do that is to get skin-safe silicone. Print a mold and cast skin-safe silicone into it so that you'd get an onahole
[18:44:43] <Sadale> abacus, LOL
[18:44:44] <analoq> 20psi should do
[18:44:44] <Sadale> analoq, LOL
[18:44:48] <analoq> :D
[18:44:58] <abacus> Sadale: ?
[18:45:12] <Sadale> Sapphirus, I'll try thinking about for a day or two. If I don't have a solution, I think I'll give up :/
[18:45:18] <Sadale> abacus, wrong highlight sorry
[18:45:19] <ButterNoodle> Sadale: I mean.. thats far more exciting to make a mold of ur imouto's parts for the perfect onahole
[18:45:21] <Sadale> abacus, I meant to highlight analoq 
[18:45:31] <Sadale> ButterNoodle, LOL no
[18:45:36] <ButterNoodle> :<
[18:45:38] <ButterNoodle> I can help
[18:45:46] <Sapphirus> Sadale, unfortunately a butt plug makes no sense for me. I can generate such intense orgasms, which generate such intense contracts that it sometimes hurts afterwards.
[18:45:53] <Sapphirus> contractions*
[18:45:55] <Sadale> ButterNoodle, not without her consent. Plus, isn't every pussy mostly the same? Unlike onahole there's no texture inside
[18:46:03] <ButterNoodle> no
[18:46:05] <MootPoot> plug up ur coax connectors
[18:46:12] <ButterNoodle> they are all very unique
[18:46:15] <ButterNoodle> legit
[18:46:17] <Sadale> ButterNoodle, :o
[18:46:22] * MootPoot terminates pussy openings
[18:46:24] <Sadale> ButterNoodle, weird.
[18:46:29] <MootPoot> dont want to lose signal
[18:46:31] <Sapphirus> I say unfortunately but it's fortunate.
[18:46:31] <ButterNoodle> no 2 cocks look the same
[18:46:33] * Sadale is a virgin so he's in no position to question ButterNoodle
[18:46:55] <Matt|home> such a charming conversation
[18:46:57] <Sapphirus> Butt plugs are gross. 
[18:47:01] <Sadale> haha
[18:47:17] <ButterNoodle> it may be more appropriate to say they "wear" differently
[18:47:18] <Sadale> I mean if it's required for preventing me from cumming, why not
[18:47:29] <ButterNoodle> Sapphirus: ur not washing them properly if they are gross
[18:47:36] <ButterNoodle> but..
[18:47:41] <Sapphirus> No I just think the idea of shoving something up your arse is gross.
[18:47:50] <bxgelsan> Sadale: do you hear british accent better or american accent ?
[18:47:56] <Sadale> bxgelsan, American
[18:48:04] <ButterNoodle> when I was in middle school, every one of them was the same - to damn tight
[18:48:16] <bxgelsan> Sadale: what about the british one makes it harder, if you could explain.
[18:48:20] <Sadale> lewd
[18:48:21] <analoq> british accent is nasty
[18:48:36] <Sadale> bxgelsan, I'm just more used to listening to american accent. That's the more common one spoken in the internet
[18:49:01] <ButterNoodle> as I got older - and presumably running into irl onaholes of different mileages.. there was a noticeable different in depth, texture, firmness, and tightness
[18:49:02] <analoq> i mean in the end it depends on how strong their local accent is. a good british speaker is good to understand, same with americans
[18:49:13] <Sadale> If I'm used to listening to British accent, it'd make american accent more difficult to me
[18:49:29] <Sadale> ButterNoodle, ah...
[18:49:32] <Sadale> ButterNoodle, TIL
[18:49:37] <Sapphirus> Certain american accents are unbearable
[18:49:44] <analoq> yeah
[18:49:45] <Sadale> ButterNoodle, Not that I'd use this knowledge for anything tho. I'm gonna stay virgin. :P
[18:50:00] <Sadale> oh yeah. Some american accents are difficult to me as well. the US is huge
[18:50:01] <ButterNoodle> after they shit out a kid or two.. dramatic differences
[18:50:34] <Sadale> ButterNoodle, does that get better or worse?
[18:50:42] <analoq> kekw
[18:50:46] <ButterNoodle> only if u ask for the daddy stitch
[18:50:49] <Sadale> Would that get loose after giving bath?
[18:50:51] <ButterNoodle> it gets better
[18:50:56] <DunceCotus> don't go breaking my colon
[18:50:56] <Sadale> interesting.
[18:51:11] <DunceCotus> [don't go breaking my] [don't go breaking my] 
[18:51:30] <ButterNoodle> *different - not tighter or looser tbh.. different texture
[18:53:22] <Sadale> weird.
[18:53:33] <ButterNoodle> ik.. the human body is a mystery
[18:53:36] <Sadale> ButterNoodle, I still don't believe that the texture can be replicated in any of the onaholes tho.
[18:53:56] <Sadale> AFAIK, you can't just make a mold out of a real pussy.

[20:22:24] <KatrinValerie> A lot of it is just getting over trauma and getting back to doing things
[20:22:31] <KatrinValerie> it's just really hard when depression hits you as well

[23:02:34] <DPA> I just had a really f'd up dream. It was some kind of game, and not a PC one. From time to time, the ranking was shown. There were 4 ranked teams with 4 players each, each of which being assigned one of 4 colors exclusively. It was red, green, blue, and unspecified.
[23:02:34] <DPA> The players in the teams were ranked too. No scores were shown, but the order of teams and players showed who was in the lead. The ranked team wasn't the players who playing together. Instead, the groups colored the same did.
[23:02:34] <DPA> I don't know what the game was about. In the dream, I was just cluelessly walking somewhere, I was confused because there was massive amounts of goo in the trees. Then, I was hit with some of it, and I thought eww, gross. A group of girls were laughing. Then I woke up.
