[00:07:49] <zeroc00l0> I want to prove that there is no non-constant polynomial with integer coefficients, f, such that for all integers, x, f(x) is a prime.
[00:07:49] <zeroc00l0> Suppose there is such a polynomial, call it f.  Then there must be integers a and b such that, a != b, f(a) = p, f(b) = q and p != q where p and q are both prime.  Given that p and q are prime, gcd(p, q) = 1, and so there must be integers u and w such that, a - b = pu + qw and equivalently a - pu = b + qw.  Then, a is congruent to a - pu (mod p)
[00:07:49] <zeroc00l0> which means that f(a) is congruent to f(a - pu) (mod p), and we know that p divides f(a - pu) because f(a) = p.  Repeating that subproof with b and q shows that q divides f(b + qw), which is equivalent to q divides f(a - pu).  But now f(a - pu) is divided by two distinct primes, which means that it is composite, contradicting the supposition.
[00:07:50] <zeroc00l0> Is this proof correct?

[01:26:46] <blahboybaz> I'm confused about some thing - I'm not a big math guy so don't go all crazy with terminology on me... I have to state it in two sets of questions really because my confusion is great. Part one verifying and displaying how I think the basics work. Part two the actual quesitons  -->   Suppose I have two numbers (a,b) where both are positive integers and are not equal to one another, and I need to find
[01:26:52] <blahboybaz> the lowest common multiple which is also divisible every number a through b (inclusive). [1]: Makes sure my terminology is correct... The "multiplicands" are (a,b) - right? And the "multiplier" is the number you multiply each of them by - right? And, finally, the "multiple" is the product of the multiplier and the multiplicand - right? [2]: If [1] is correct then when there are two multiplicands there
[01:26:58] <blahboybaz> will also be two multipliers - right? One for each of the multiplicands? [3]: If [1] and [2] are correct then you will have s situation where the set of multipliers for each multiplicand will increment by different amounts - example: let (a,b) = (2,5) and multiplier be positive integers starting at 1 and incrementing by 1 each calculation. then the miltipliers of a are [2, 4, 6...] and the multipliers
[01:27:04] <blahboybaz> for b are [5, 10, 15...].  So Here is my questions / confusion.. [1]: if the set of multipliers increments by a different amount for each multiplicand then do I need to look for my answer in both sets or just one? Why? [2]: Is it possible that one or the other set of muliples skips over the answer and that's why the number I'm looking for could appear in either set? [3]: Or does one set (maybe the one
[01:27:10] <blahboybaz> coming from the smaller number) contained in the other set so that I only need to look for my answer in one or the other set of multipliers (perhaps the one comeing from the larger number)?

[02:20:57] <PlanckWalk> There's a few ways to do that.

[02:24:44] <blahboybaz> the smallest such number. OR it means BOTH the product of a or b must be divisible by a, b and everything in between  a and b and it has to be the smallest such number
[02:25:59] <PlanckWalk> The number you're looking for has to be "evenly divided by both, as well as by all sequential numbers in the range between these parameters"
[02:26:21] <PlanckWalk> I.e. for [1,5] it must be divisible by all of [1,2,3,4,5]

[03:08:03] <blahboybaz> I wish I could remember the name of it. It was one of the last things we were doing in class before I left university. They would literally show a picture looked like a clock where each step was another remainder but the number you were getting the remainder from continued to increase. So you would wrap around and get the same remainder for an even larger number further down the line and you could then
[03:08:09] <blahboybaz> list an entire set of numbers for which the remainder was the same.

[03:20:22] <ski> e.g. modulo ⌜12⌝, there's only four numbers which are invertible, ⌜1⌝,⌜5⌝,⌜7⌝,⌜11⌝. but ⌜5² ≡ 1 (mod 12)⌝ and likewise ⌜7² ≡ (−5)² ≡ 1 (mod 12)⌝ (and obviously ⌜1² ≡ 1 (mod 12)⌝ and ⌜11² ≡ (−1)² ≡ 1 (mod 12)⌝ .. so none of these four generates all of them, so we can't take discrete logarithm with base any of them
[03:20:32] <blahboybaz> I've come up with a better description of what we were doing. Since the equation the base set of numbers is generated from can change the set of numbers generated from it can change and because of that the finite set of remainders will be different for that set.

[08:37:53] <pounce> but neither a+b or a-b
[08:38:53] <pounce> i actually don't know if it is or not, but you colud test this
[08:39:25] <Xardas> I think the first formula is used in factoring
[08:39:37] <Xardas> and the second one for expanding
[08:40:33] <pounce> what is its use in factoring?
[08:43:44] <Xardas> If we have this equation (x+3)(x^2 - 3x + 9)
[08:43:55] <Xardas> we can simply write it as (x+3)^3
[08:44:53] <pounce> no
[08:45:17] <pounce> it's (x+3)(x^2+6x+9)
[08:45:52] <pounce> it's the same formula, since factoring and expanding are reverses of eachother
[08:46:41] <pounce> Xardas: try multiplying (x+3)^3 out for yourself to see
[08:47:04] <Xardas> that's bizzare

[08:49:57] <Fangs> Xardas: (x^3+y^3) =/= (x+y)^3 btw
[08:50:19] <pounce> a^3+b^3 is different than (a+b)^3, no matter how many freshmen wish it were
[08:50:39] <Xardas> that's hilarious !!
[08:50:42] <Xardas> Seriously ?
[08:50:48] <pounce> yes
[08:50:57] <pounce> exponentiation and addition do not distribute
[08:51:10] <pounce> think about it like this: exponentiation distributes over multiplication, which distributes over addition
[08:51:19] <pounce> but it does not work from exponentiation -> addition
[08:51:43] <Fangs> Xardas: try x = 1 and y = 1. in the first case you get x^3 + y^3 = 1^3 + 1^3 = 2. if you add the sums first (1+1)^3 I think that's bigger than 2
[08:51:45] <pounce> try it with (1+2)^2=3^2=9, but 1^2+2^2=1+4=5

[09:04:01] <pounce> complex manifolds!
[09:04:05] <greenbagels> ahh ok
[09:04:10] <pounce> and i've read ISM, IRM and now ICM  (in the works)
[09:04:11] <greenbagels> but you read his other books before it?
[09:04:15] <greenbagels> ah ok
[09:04:23] <greenbagels> did you read through the *entirety* of ISM?
[09:04:38] <pounce> my course went through ch 20 prety much, through foliations (fascinating things)
[09:04:52] <greenbagels> damn
[09:04:54] <greenbagels> thats intense
[09:04:56] <pounce> although we skipped Riemannian manifolds almost entirely

[09:06:04] <greenbagels> ive owned this book for like 2 years now and i still havent gotten the momentum to keep going through it lol
[09:06:52] <pounce> yeah, having a course for it helped a lot, and a group to talk to it with
[09:06:55] <greenbagels> i think i should probably not try to prove/understand every theorem and exercise the first time around though
[09:07:02] <greenbagels> yeah that kind of stuff does help me

[09:10:08] <pounce> ours is usually both (from what i understand, was an undergrad at the time), but since it was spring 2020 they changed it :)

[11:14:08] <greenbagels> i dont remember how many cardinal arithmetic results require choice, but i seem to recall some do
[11:14:39] <PlanckWalk> Trichotomy of cardinals requires choice, and that's one of the most basic cardinal results
[11:15:00] <greenbagels> but you do also raise a good point of construction vs non-constructive existence
[11:19:38] <PlanckWalk> Even the proof that countable unions of countable sets are countable can't be made in ZF without Coice.
[11:19:43] <blackfield> well B<=c would require transfinite induction or similar (where B is borel sigma algebra on R), so perhaps it's there

[14:22:42] <Encrypt> The objective is to evenly distribute the different "shards" of an ElasticSearch cluster between data nodes, so that one data node doesn't do more work than the others (which leads to performance issues)

[14:23:35] <Encrypt> In ElasticSearch, the data is indexed into "indexes" and each index is composed of multiple shards (which are lucene segments) and replicas

[14:25:04] <kamil> are you searching here for abstract solution ?
[14:25:28] <kamil> or for ElasticSearch one ? if for latter, go to other group
[14:25:47] <Encrypt> To answer your question "Why did I come to ##math": we have a lot of indices and therefore a lot of shards in the cluster.
[14:26:04] <zer0python> Encrypt: average the number of nodes and distribute based on a prng derived from that average.
[14:26:07] <kamil> abstract this and come to ##math
[14:26:55] <Encrypt> We have used or-tools to solve the problem, with the SCIP Mixed Integer Programming algorithm (https://www.scipopt.org/)
[14:27:22] <Encrypt> We're not sure it's the best approach to solve a "large" optimistion problem

[14:29:11] <Encrypt> By grouping shards into sets, with approximately the same size
[14:29:47] <Encrypt> zer0python, How would you use the PRNG?

[14:32:27] <zer0python> Encrypt: so, index each node consequtively, use a lehmar-like method (as modulo should rotate more-or-less in some order), when you receive N from the prng() map to the proper IP.
[14:33:55] <zer0python> so number-of-shards / number-of-nodes is probably an ideal m value
[14:34:28] <zer0python> er, I mean y value, number-of-nodes would be your m value.
[14:35:18] <fweht> if i have two sequences of 'linearly independent' points in RP^n, how many invertible linear maps from R^{n+1} to R^{n+1} exist *at most* which map one sequence to the other?  i guess its not a unique map, like it would be in R^n?
[14:35:31] <zer0python> m = number-of-nodes, and a = number-of-shards / number-of-nodes
[14:35:46] <zer0python> (maybe round to nearest prime, but not sure.)
[14:35:52] <Encrypt> zer0python, All nodes should have the same number of shards actually. But the shard size varies (quite significantly)

[18:15:07] <int-e> twice: Maybe they mean just the monomial ordering part? Then, to divide p by q, pick the largest monomial m_q in q; then, as long as p has monomials that are divisible by m_q, subtract a multiple of q that eliminates the largest one. This will give you a well-defined quotient and remainder.

[19:09:09] <int-e> fweht: When mapping x_i to y_i, you end up with a homogeneous linear equation (on (n+1)-dimensional vectors) A x_i = b_i y_i  where the unknowns are A and b_i. So that gives you a nullspace of dimension (n+1)^2 + (n+2) - (n+2)(n+1) = 1 (or higher).

[20:31:56] <Z-module> cadmio, aren't you just checking that R/I has only two ideals, itself and (0) ?
[20:32:45] <Z-module> and that's because the set of all ideals of R/I is in bijection with the set of all ideals of R that contain I, and I is maximal
[20:33:00] <cadmio> if R/I is a field that's true by the Lemma
[20:34:17] <Z-module> well, you have to focus on one direction at a time
[20:35:04] <cadmio> R/I is a field then has only {0} and R/I as ideals
[20:35:40] <Z-module> right
[20:36:24] <Z-module> so {all ideals of R/I} is a set with two elements. Thus the set {all ideals of R containing I} has two elements also. So.....
[20:39:41] <isekaijin> Z-module: The definition of maximality requires being a two-sided ideal, right?

[20:42:00] <Z-module> Yes, that theorem, that you are proving here in two parts, is: If R is commutative, then for an ideal I of R:   (i) R/I is a field => I is maximal.   (ii) I maximal => R/I is a field.
[20:44:22] <Z-module> isekaijin: this whole thing needs R to be commutative, so it doesn't matter, all ideals are two-sided
[20:45:05] <Z-module> isekaijin: but we do also (in non-comm ring theory) talk about strictly left ideals that are maximal among all left ideals, and the right-side version of that.
[20:45:21] <Z-module> but yeah, if you just plain see "maximal ideal" without qualifiers, that means two-sided

[20:54:37] <Z-module> Probably only in proving certain obscure things
[20:54:40] <isekaijin> Ah.
[20:55:09] <Franciman> :)
[20:56:29] <Z-module> This reminds me: Practically everywhere that you see the theorem about nonzero rings with 1 always having a maximal ideal, they state it just for commutative rings. But commutativity is irrelevant.
[20:57:53] <Z-module> however the having 1 is crucial
[20:59:12] <Franciman> cuz you can't start from nowhere right?
[20:59:23] <isekaijin> I don't really think of rngs as rings.
[21:00:03] <Z-module> no, because for example take the additive group Q and defined all "products" in it to be 0. This gives a rng (a ring without 1). It has no maximal ideals at all, because Q has no maxiaml proper additive subgroups.

[22:57:04] *** Joins: hashfuncf39 (~user@2601:5c0:c280:7090:29ba:fcc0:8f3a:efac)
[22:57:29] <DPA> I think it should be k=⌈n/2-1⌉, but only for n > 2, because no people can sit on 0 tables, and k needs to be rounded up, as there are no partial tables.
[22:57:32] <biberao> ok explain me better the tables and people example
[22:57:47] <biberao> please
[22:58:22] *** Joins: jpn (~jpn@user/jpn)
[22:58:32] <rex> if n is the maximum amount of people than can be seated on m tables like demanded, then n = 2m + 2
[22:58:42] <rex> or m = (n - 2)/2
[22:58:56] <rex> but as DPA pointed out this formula needs to be adapted for integer awareness
[22:59:11] <biberao> ah
[22:59:26] <biberao> ok
[22:59:28] <rex> and for the n > 2 case
[22:59:32] <biberao> i should have defined it better
[22:59:35] <rex> if you now add k tables
[22:59:50] <rex> you get 2(m + k) + 2 = 2m + 2k + 2 = n + 2k people
[22:59:57] <rex> where n is the "old" n
[23:00:03] <rex> so 2k people more

[23:00:15] <biberao> so
[23:00:18] <biberao> can i say
[23:00:32] <biberao> its like doing T_n and T_n+1
[23:00:34] <biberao> ?
[23:00:46] <biberao> but instead of adding one more table i add k tables?

[23:01:29] *** southey2 is now known as foxtrot
[23:01:42] <biberao> 2m+2 i guess?
[23:01:59] <biberao> like the n term
[23:02:41] <rex> I already defined n and m, so if you make new defs, you need to be clear about it
[23:02:55] *** Joins: KevinX (~KevinX@user/KevinX)
[23:03:02] <rex> so what's T supposed to be?
[23:03:09] <biberao> T = term
[23:03:52] <biberao> how do i say
[23:04:05] <biberao> adding more k tables to n

[23:04:30] <biberao> isnt that adding k terms to the sequence?
[23:05:15] <rex> you can define it as a sequecne

[23:05:43] <rex> P_m is the max amount of people that can be seated on m tables
[23:06:00] <rex> then you can calculate P_{m + k} - P_m
