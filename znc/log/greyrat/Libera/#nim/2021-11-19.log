[06:27:29] <FromDiscord> <ùôßùôöùô¢> planning to leave discord soon bc privacy concerns n shit
[06:27:49] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Scroll down to community https://nim-lang.org/
[06:29:04] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Uhh you dont have `whim/types`

[06:29:31] <FromDiscord> <ùôßùôöùô¢> isnt it in the whim folder

[06:29:43] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> For some reason you're missing files on this branch
[06:29:44] <FromDiscord> <ùôßùôöùô¢> wtf
[06:29:56] <FromDiscord> <ùôßùôöùô¢> did git pull a braindead
[06:30:00] <FromDiscord> <ùôßùôöùô¢> lemme check out this
[06:31:17] <FromDiscord> <ùôßùôöùô¢> done it
[06:31:28] <FromDiscord> <ùôßùôöùô¢> unfortunately had to commit the binary which has the same name of whim
[06:31:35] <FromDiscord> <ùôßùôöùô¢> that was what was fucking it up
[06:31:41] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> ah git ignore it üòÄ
[06:31:44] <FromDiscord> <ùôßùôöùô¢> idk if i can only exclude binary w/ the same name
[06:32:12] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Yea you can there is a way to remove all binaries then add dirs
[06:32:23] <FromDiscord> <ùôßùôöùô¢> probably effort‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
[06:32:31] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> It's like 4 lines of git
[06:32:41] <FromDiscord> <ùôßùôöùô¢> oof
[06:32:43] <FromDiscord> <ùôßùôöùô¢> anyway
[06:32:45] <FromDiscord> <ùôßùôöùô¢> take a look pls
[06:33:49] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> The issue is you dont export `tables`
[06:34:22] <FromDiscord> <ùôßùôöùô¢> hm?
[06:34:24] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> there is no `[]=` in the config space for `Table` so you either need to `import std/tables`  there or `export tables` in types
[06:34:42] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Exported types dont bring in procedures with them unless they're also exported
[06:34:47] <FromDiscord> <ùôßùôöùô¢> ahhh
[06:35:01] <FromDiscord> <ùôßùôöùô¢> how would i do it the export route
[06:35:01] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> You either need to export your dependant modules or import them in the other module
[06:35:02] <FromDiscord> <ùôßùôöùô¢> im curious
[06:35:09] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> I showed
[06:35:11] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> `export tables`
[06:35:17] <FromDiscord> <ùôßùôöùô¢> inside the types block?
[06:35:24] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Put that in `types.nim` after the import
[06:35:41] <FromDiscord> <ùôßùôöùô¢> ahh
[06:35:42] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> sent a code paste, see https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=3FpB
[06:35:51] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> And yes I'll continue pushing `std/` on people
[06:36:09] <FromDiscord> <ùôßùôöùô¢> i use it anyways
[06:36:13] <FromDiscord> <ùôßùôöùô¢> seems wrong to not
[06:36:59] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> And that's why `include` fixed it
[06:37:12] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> cause now that module was importing tables
[06:38:12] <FromDiscord> <ùôßùôöùô¢> ah i see
[06:38:49] <FromDiscord> <ùôßùôöùô¢> how can i delete this dummy branch now
[06:39:23] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> `git branch -d origin/branchName` `git checkout main`
[06:39:30] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Or whatever you call the master branch
[06:39:43] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> It might move you  back to main automatically
[06:40:00] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Ah sorry that's locally it's `git push origin --delete origin/branchName`
[06:44:42] *** Quits: arkurious (~arkurious@user/arkurious) (Quit: Leaving)
[06:55:01] <FromDiscord> <sharpcdf> why are more desktop irc clients being created if discord already exists
[06:55:11] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Lol
[06:55:13] <FromDiscord> <sharpcdf> makes no sense at all
[06:55:19] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Discord is a proprietary chat application
[06:55:19] <FromDiscord> <ùôßùôöùô¢> because no one likes electron ;)
[06:55:25] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> People like IRC
[06:55:29] <FromDiscord> <sharpcdf> true and truer
[06:55:44] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Also as i see you joined on matrix, matrix isnt IRC
[06:55:56] <FromDiscord> <sharpcdf> oh really?
[06:55:57] <FromDiscord> <sharpcdf> what is it
[06:55:59] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Matrix is a newer open protocol
[06:56:21] <FromDiscord> <sharpcdf> also either way discord isnt in its infancy like a lot of these matrix clients look like
[06:56:41] <FromDiscord> <sharpcdf> i think it makes more sense to use discord at least until matrix clients progress more
[06:56:58] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> It's also a closed source chat client, you cannot self host, or use your own clients
[06:56:59] <nrds> <06Prestige99> Yeah matrix client aren't good atm
[06:57:07] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> So it's awful if you ask me
[06:57:11] <nrds> <06Prestige99> Sticking to IRC till that happens
[06:57:17] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Eh element seems fine to me
[06:57:25] <FromDiscord> <sharpcdf> true, but again just for everyday use discord is just the better option
[06:57:26] <FromDiscord> <sharpcdf> (for now)
[06:57:27] <nrds> <06Prestige99> really? Element has been terrible for me
[06:57:35] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> In what way?
[06:57:44] <FromDiscord> <sharpcdf> im on element rn it just seems too basic
[06:58:06] <nrds> <06Prestige99> especially on mobile - takes forever to load, messages get stuck, calls are buggy/don't work half the time
[06:58:12] <FromDiscord> <sharpcdf> and you cant join anything without an invite, which can kind of defeat the purpose of having communities on it
[06:58:18] <nrds> <06Prestige99> on desktop it takes like a full minute to load chat
[06:58:22] <FromDiscord> <sharpcdf> then you just need a direct invite
[06:58:24] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> You can join communities
[06:58:32] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> you dont need invites
[06:58:44] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> there are public communities anyone can join
[06:58:52] <FromDiscord> <sharpcdf> yea im comparing element delay to discord rn its about 2 seconds‚Üµ(<@709044657232936960_nrds=5b=49=52=43=5d>)
[06:58:53] <FromDiscord> <sharpcdf> really long
[06:59:10] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Yea i dont have any of these issues on desktop element
[06:59:19] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Though i havent used the voip
[06:59:38] <FromDiscord> <ùôßùôöùô¢> the voip is not bad
[06:59:54] <FromDiscord> <sharpcdf> i mean i think its decent, it just needs to have more things that people can use instead of just the basic chat and voIP
[07:00:24] <FromDiscord> <sharpcdf> there needs to be at least community discovery if its going to get nearly as popular as discord
[07:00:27] <FromDiscord> <sharpcdf> (in my opinion)
[07:00:31] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> There is
[07:00:39] <FromDiscord> <sharpcdf> wait what
[07:00:42] <FromDiscord> <sharpcdf> where lol i dont see it
[07:00:47] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> image.png https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/371759389889003532/911096135706361886/image.png
[07:00:55] <FromDiscord> <sharpcdf> whattt
[07:00:56] <FromDiscord> <sharpcdf> all i see is create room
[07:01:04] <FromDiscord> <sharpcdf> oph snap i see it
[07:01:07] <FromDiscord> <sharpcdf> alright nice
[07:01:41] <FromDiscord> <sharpcdf> now its starting to appeal to me
[07:01:43] <FromDiscord> <sharpcdf> especially since its open source
[07:01:43] <FromDiscord> <sharpcdf> and it can integrate with discord
[07:01:43] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Lol we did it we sold someone on the premise of the matrix protocol
[07:01:44] <FromDiscord> <sharpcdf> lets gooooo
[07:01:46] <FromDiscord> <sharpcdf> one more member!
[07:02:11] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Spaces(equivalent to discord servers) are in beta but will be eventually stable
[07:02:16] <FromDiscord> <sharpcdf> and you can freely add servers to the discovery
[07:02:18] <FromDiscord> <sharpcdf> but one thing
[07:02:21] <FromDiscord> <sharpcdf> as far as i know
[07:02:24] <FromDiscord> <sharpcdf> theres no bots
[07:02:27] <FromDiscord> <sharpcdf> \:(
[07:02:29] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> There are bots
[07:02:33] <FromDiscord> <sharpcdf> bro what
[07:02:36] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> The bridge is a bot
[07:02:41] <FromDiscord> <sharpcdf> i know
[07:02:43] <FromDiscord> <sharpcdf> but im talking like
[07:02:48] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> The entire thing is open source how do you go "No bots" üòÄ
[07:02:52] <FromDiscord> <sharpcdf> an api for making bots
[07:02:59] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> https://matrix.org/docs/projects/other/python-matrix-bot-api/
[07:03:01] <FromDiscord> <sharpcdf> just didnt think anyone made it yet
[07:03:07] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> https://matrix.org/bots/
[07:03:26] <FromDiscord> <sharpcdf> ok this is üî•
[07:03:52] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Yea i very much want it to succeed, there is also someone working on a nim sdk for matrix
[07:04:37] <FromDiscord> <sharpcdf> nice
[07:05:02] <FromDiscord> <sharpcdf> what are the currente api bindings
[07:06:03] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> This is what i was talking about https://github.com/dylhack/matrix-nim-sdk
[07:06:25] <FromDiscord> <sharpcdf> ohh nice
[07:07:02] <FromDiscord> <sharpcdf> lets go theres a go sdk
[07:07:09] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> No let's not
[07:07:15] <FromDiscord> <sharpcdf> lol wdym
[07:07:19] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> It's go
[07:07:19] <FromDiscord> <sharpcdf> i personally favor golang
[07:07:42] <FromDiscord> <sharpcdf> its stdlib is extremely versatile
[07:07:48] <FromDiscord> <sharpcdf> i get why people dont like it
[07:07:54] <FromDiscord> <sharpcdf> but to me the pros outweigh the cons
[07:09:00] <FromDiscord> <sharpcdf> well so far im liking element but dont appreciate the paid version
[07:09:21] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Element is a for profit company so what do you expect
[07:10:01] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> You can self host your own matrix servers and use the client with no issue
[07:10:23] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> So given that they do need money to actually develop/compete with other chat apps i think it's a fine method
[07:10:28] <FromDiscord> <sharpcdf> ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
[07:12:13] <FromDiscord> <sharpcdf> also about golang, i would 100% switch to zig(hopefully you know it lol), but the compiler errors constantly with an AccessDenied error
[07:12:22] <FromDiscord> <sharpcdf> anddd its not even v1.0.0 yet
[07:12:29] <FromDiscord> <sharpcdf> its like v0.8.1
[07:12:45] <FromDiscord> <sharpcdf> really hoping that they fix the bug soon

[07:49:32] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Damn it snows here so it's fun!
[07:49:59] <FromDiscord> <evoalg> at least I didn't know what I was missing
[07:50:56] <FromDiscord> <evoalg> When I first wanted to chat on nim for the first time (recently) I tried to find a non-paid irc client and downloaded LimeChat, but I couldn't get it going to I jumped on Discord (which I already had)
[07:52:22] <FromDiscord> <evoalg> In reply to @Elegantbeef "And yes I'll continue": the syntax highlighter I use doesn't recognize "std/" when I import, so it bugs me
[07:53:49] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> You're using nvim eh?
[07:54:45] <FromDiscord> <evoalg> yes
[07:59:22] <FromDiscord> <evoalg> sent a long message, see http://ix.io/3FpN
[08:00:14] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Yea i had issues setting up nvim aswell, though it's not my main editor
[08:00:23] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Kinda interested in onivim2 since it's super easy to setup
[08:00:42] <FromDiscord> <evoalg> I ended up having to look up how to turn off popups for autocomplete as it was I found it annoying as hell
[08:00:52] <FromDiscord> <evoalg> ohhh what's your main editor? vscode?
[08:01:26] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Yea i use vscode, but toy with nvim, which is why onivim2 is interesting
[08:01:33] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Vscode like extensions/gui but a vim editor
[08:01:47] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> i say like extensions, but it just uses vscode extensions üòÄ
[08:02:17] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> I know a few other Nim developers used it and liked it üòÄ
[08:02:33] <FromDiscord> <evoalg> oh nice!
[08:04:12] <FromDiscord> <evoalg> when I tried vscode I don't think I set it up properly either, as it doesn't highlight lint errors or something .. eg if I do `x = 3` when x in a string it doesn't tell me like nvim does (something like that anyway)
[08:04:28] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Yep you didnt set it up right

[08:05:06] <FromDiscord> <evoalg> ok ... since I'm a vim lover I guess I didn't look for a solution
[08:05:18] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Lol
[08:06:18] <FromDiscord> <evoalg> I just fired up vscode and put that exact example and it didn't complain
[08:07:00] <FromDiscord> <evoalg> I tried the konst and the saem one
[08:07:22] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> you need `errorLens` üòÄ
[08:07:51] <FromDiscord> <evoalg> oh .... disclaimer ... I had never used vscode before either
[08:07:52] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=usernamehw.errorlens though even with out it the line should get a squiggle
[08:08:05] <FromDiscord> <Rika> I‚Äôd use Oni 2 if it wasn‚Äôt more vscode like
[08:08:18] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> But eitherway no reason to use vscode if you like vim
[08:08:19] <FromDiscord> <evoalg> lol
[08:09:05] <FromDiscord> <evoalg> looks like errorlens is in the list for me to install
[08:09:54] <FromDiscord> <evoalg> restarted ... still doesn't work
[08:10:22] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Do you have an error provider
[08:11:03] <FromDiscord> <evoalg> I don't know what that is
[08:11:07] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> There is a "Nim\: Lint On Save"
[08:11:16] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> So you might have that disabled, but yea odd behaviour
[08:11:43] <FromDiscord> <evoalg> ahhh maybe ....
[08:13:54] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Your nim plugin is not giving you errors?
[08:14:05] <FromDiscord> <evoalg> in my vscode preferences I searched for lint and it's got "Nim: Lint On Save" but that's already ticked
[08:14:21] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Does your code have errors in the first place haha
[08:15:23] <FromDiscord> <evoalg> yea I used the example Elegantbeef did above ... assigning an int to a string var
[08:20:01] <FromDiscord> <evoalg> I run the code and I get `Error: type mismatch: got 'int literal(300)' for '300' but expected 'string'` which is what it should be, but no lint highlighting ... hate vscode!
[08:20:40] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Understandable
[08:23:15] <FromDiscord> <evoalg> I installed the one off the site you gave me and disabled the other one, still no joy
[08:25:03] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Well errorlens is just to present the code on the line, the nim extension is still needed to be enabled, but i worry this is just going to fuel a "i must get it working regardless of time"
[08:25:40] <FromDiscord> <evoalg> yea it's a distractions I guess üòâ
[08:29:59] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> You can hit `ctrl + j` then go to ouput and click the nim extension in the dropdown to see if there are any issues
[08:30:54] <FromDiscord> <evoalg> command + j ... I'm on a mac
[08:31:06] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Sorry for your loss
[08:33:24] <FromDiscord> <evoalg> no issue found when doing that ... the only message is under "Explorer: Outline" which says "no symbols found in document 'bar.nim'"
[08:34:52] <FromDiscord> <evoalg> I know I don't like mac that much, I prefer linux ... in fact I run linux on docker on this mac, and I run vnim and nim on linux that way. I have no gui, but that's that way I like it
[08:35:24] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Is that an apple silicon mac atleast?
[08:37:31] <FromDiscord> <evoalg> no it's intel
[08:44:37] <FromDiscord> <evoalg> yesterday I went through a whole heap of plugins for nvim, and each one annoyed me, and so I've gone back to no "plugged" plugins at all, just the alaviss plugin for syntax highlighting etc
[09:06:36] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> You best have given up by now! üòÄ
[10:00:13] <FromDiscord> <Valdar> In reply to @evoalg "yea I used the": VSCode only lints on saved files, not just on what is on the screen. Turn on autosave and set to "save on delay" and it should show errors in about a sec after you stop typing
[10:00:44] <FromDiscord> <evoalg> ok I'll try
[10:02:34] <FromDiscord> <evoalg> woefully it was already set that both of those things
[10:03:52] <FromDiscord> <evoalg> but thank you for trying ... but no worries, my true love is vim anyway. Sometimes I try other things to see what the fuss it about
[10:04:11] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> We cant wait for you to try programming üòõ
[10:06:33] <FromDiscord> <evoalg> https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=3Fq7 like this you mean?

[14:41:51] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> In reply to @evoalg "I'm trying to recursively": you are checking a type and in nim types are static, so you should use `when`

[14:42:03] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> but why do this? tuples aren't really supposed to be used for this
[14:43:51] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> also be aware that this approach will generate a lot of functions for each tuple, because it's an implicit generic
[14:43:58] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> so it has to generate a function for each combination of types
[14:44:13] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> in the code above it'll make two functions
[14:45:02] <FromDiscord> <evoalg> Thank you ... I was trying some easy recursive exercises from python and seeing if I could do it in nim ... the exercise was to sum the python list `[1, 2, [3, 4], [5, 6]]` but in nim only tuples can be heterogeneous right?
[14:45:33] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> well, in this case yes, but generally you wouldn't use such an approach in nim
[14:45:46] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> and also tuples aren't a good way to replicate this python behaviour
[14:45:56] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> because you can't "create" new tuple types in runtime
[14:46:16] <FromDiscord> <evoalg> ahhh I see
[14:46:20] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> the best approach to replicate this would be to use a `seq` storing object variants

[16:46:01] <PMunch> But just for completeness the way you're "supposed" to do it is to create a Rand object with `initRand` and then pass that in as a var parameter
[16:46:25] <PMunch> That will avoid the side effect and not simply hide it
[16:46:38] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> In reply to @PMunch "You can of course": that wasn't the problem
[16:46:56] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> as I understand it Tom asked for a way to specify _which_ side effect is fine specifically
[16:47:02] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> " a way to specify that this is the only side effect I expect"
[16:48:16] <PMunch> I know, and as you said you can't really do that as sideEffect is one single effect
[16:48:28] <PMunch> But you can do something like this: https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=3Frz
[16:49:15] <PMunch> Now you say only the side effects of `rand(high - 1)` are allowed, but no other side effect, which is essentially what they asked for
[16:50:11] <PMunch> (you could of course move `high - 1` outside the cast to make sure that no one overrides `-` and creates side effects
[16:50:55] <PMunch> Something like this: https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=3FrA
[16:51:39] <PMunch> You could of course move that into a template or it's own func if you liked

To me, calling it a `func` hides the effect. I'd rather just say `proc`. I only said `func` earlier to force the error to see what it told me.
[17:00:00] <PMunch> Ah, well as Yardanico already mentioned, side effects are a single effect in Nim. So you can't really limit your side effects to only specific things (unless you pass in var arguments like I suggested, this makes the caller aware that this argument will be mutated(.
[17:02:26] <FromDiscord> <Tom> Yeah, the argument idea is good.

[21:41:41] <FromDiscord> <dom96> in general though it seems like you are working around a limitation in nimble
[21:41:42] <FromDiscord> <brainproxy> but what if the branch I want is not head?
[21:42:23] <FromDiscord> <brainproxy> ah, sorry, you're just giving example, I misread

[21:42:46] <FromDiscord> <dom96> they might
[21:42:51] <FromDiscord> <dom96> I can't remember what nimble does in that case
[21:43:15] <FromDiscord> <dom96> just make sure you install via `nimble install foo@#branch`
[21:43:42] <FromDiscord> <dom96> but still, we should resolve that limitation you are working around

[21:45:42] <FromDiscord> <reilly> In reply to @dom96 "why are you passing": IIRC Package A needs Version X of of Package C, but Package B (or maybe their own code?) needs version Y of Package C.

[21:53:18] <FromDiscord> <exelotl> do you want them to be interchangeable e.g. {a1, a2} == {a1}
[21:55:12] <FromDiscord> <exelotl> you might be able to just use constants
[21:55:26] <FromDiscord> <exelotl> e.g. const a2 = a1

Sure sequtils templates can get a bit shorter by using it and it solves the gotcha with method call syntax, but nothing more. @Fish-Face answer to you too
