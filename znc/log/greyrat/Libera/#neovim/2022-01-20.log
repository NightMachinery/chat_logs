[03:37:04] <gour[m]> woodhardigan[m]: Heh, I also believe I could be more happy with (neo)vim...i always find taskwarrior more producive for me than org-mode, but wonder about MyST/markdown?
[03:37:35] <saltrocklamp[m]> i think there have been some attempts at org-mode for neovim
[03:37:35] <gour[m]> what would you recommend for taking notes with neovim? vimwiki?
[03:38:01] <gour[m]> yeah, but, iirc, the project is abandoned now...
[03:38:06] <saltrocklamp[m]> honestly i use joplin for notetaking, it's not neovim but i like the interface and the ability to sync w/ webdav
[03:38:11] <Bowuigi[m]> At the moment I either use Markdown or plain text
[03:38:14] <saltrocklamp[m]> if there was a good org-mode for neovim i'd probably try it
[03:38:29] <Bowuigi[m]> Might make a sort of simple idea manager later if I am bored enough
[03:39:07] <saltrocklamp[m]> what i think i want more than "text editor plugin" is a general-purpose knowledge base daemon/library
[03:39:10] <gour[m]> salt rock lamp: i was also looking at joplin...you don't mind it's electron-based? another option i like is `nb` (https://github.com/xwmx/nb)
[03:39:15] <saltrocklamp[m]> and i just want the text editor plugin to be a client thereof
[03:39:37] <saltrocklamp[m]> gour: no, it doesn't bother me. doesn't seem very heavy or slow like some electron apps
[03:39:58] <saltrocklamp[m]> i've never seen nb before, maybe it fits the description i just posted
[03:40:21] <gour[m]> take a look - very interesting and markup/editor-agnostic
[03:40:43] <saltrocklamp[m]> the one thing that i really want and that i have not yet found is a notetaking format that supports hierarchical tags and arbitrary tags
[03:40:44] <saltrocklamp[m]> s/tags/metadata fields/
[03:42:03] <saltrocklamp[m]> and of course good ux/ui related to cross-linking
[03:42:07] <saltrocklamp[m]> which i am told is one thing that org-mode excels at 
[03:42:10] <gour[m]> salt rock lamp: maybe this one: https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron but i do not want to use vscode
[03:42:17] <saltrocklamp[m]> along with things like runnable inline code blocks
[03:42:25] <woodhardigan[m]> <gour[m]> "Heh, I also believe I could be..." <- taskworrior looks really cool. Will definitely have a look
[03:42:26] <saltrocklamp[m]> yeah i am not interested in something that is tied to one specific editor, but i do think i've seen that before

[04:15:43] <dre> I just use markdown tbh, and my own scripts 
[04:15:54] <dre> you will perhaps never find something that ticks all your boxes. 
[04:16:18] <dre> one thing that helps me is "direnv" which can run commands and do things when you cd into a folder ( in your shell)

[04:16:55] <dre> so for instance I have a ./.bin/ folder with a bunch of scripts athat do things, when I cd into my notes folder, the bin gets added to the PATH
[04:17:11] <dre> so I can edit-note and new-post and things, which will open nvim and do other things for me 
[04:17:21] <dre> but not clutter up path when I'm doing other things 
[04:17:46] <dre> oh and FZF is good too, so edit-note brings up a FZF for my current notes, etc. 
[04:17:59] <dre> in shell not in nvim ( could be done probably)
[04:20:48] <woodhardigan[m]> dre: I'm just using toggle-term for that. Also using fzf with fzf.vim. I'm just testing telescope now and really considering making a change tho, just because of image previewing. That's a killer feature for me 
[04:21:10] <woodhardigan[m]> s/for/to/
[04:22:18] <saltrocklamp[m]> i use direnv too, but mostly for work stuff
[04:22:18] <woodhardigan[m]> I also need to get latex in the works. I'm sticking with markdown but there are some more complicated stuff that it just demands complex formatting and design. Quite a lot of work to do
[04:22:28] <saltrocklamp[m]> i like that they attempt to add a layer of security with `direnv allow`
[04:22:52] <saltrocklamp[m]> i'd be more open to using something like "local vimrc" / exrc if it had the same whitelisting and inspection features as direnv
[04:23:21] <dre> woodhardigan[m], there's "telekasten" that uses telescope to manage notes, has image previews and all. 
[04:23:24] <dre> right up your alley
[04:23:25] <saltrocklamp[m]> that said, maybe a direnv neovim plugin is the way to go, or at least setting some kind of env var that subsequently enables/disables the local vimrc

[04:24:29] <dre> saltrocklamp[m], now THAT could be interesting. perhaps try it out with direnv set envar; then alias nvim as nvim -u $MY_VIMRC  ?
[04:24:51] <saltrocklamp[m]> well "local exrc" is already a thing in plain vim

[14:04:45] <skebangaskebang4> However, on startup, this does nothing... the highlight doesn't take effect
[14:05:20] <skebangaskebang4> **but**, if I run a command locally, after startup, `:lua vim.api.nvim_command('highlight IndentBlanklineContextChar guifg=#61afef gui=nocombine')`, then the new highlight colorscheme works!
[14:06:22] <clason[m]> yes.
[14:06:24] <skebangaskebang4> Why does setting the highlight in my setup function not work, but running the exact same command after startup work?
[14:06:45] <clason[m]> you need to put modifications into a `ColorScheme` autocommand to make sure they are not overridden by the colorscheme
[14:07:00] <clason[m]> (which usually does `hi clear` first thing)
[14:07:20] <skebangaskebang4> how do I do that? 
[14:07:29] <clason[m]> as always, reading `:h startup` is highly recommended
[14:07:36] <skebangaskebang4> :) ok, will do!

[19:43:06] <JulianJulianBerm> do you mean whether the shrinker needs to be neovim aware? I think algorithmically no, if I understand the question
[19:43:42] <JulianJulianBerm> basically what I think I wish for is if hypothesis (https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ -- quickcheck for python if you're more familiar with that) was somehow usable, and had a library of strategies for neovim editing operations
[19:44:02] <kylo252[m]> I just meant that the algorithm itself is a separate question, but let me take a look at that
[19:44:12] <JulianJulianBerm> right agreed!
[19:45:58] <JulianJulianBerm> (the underlying algorithm for shrinking that hypothesis uses would work very much the same with no changes I think, it's just writing the FFI layer to call it from Lua, and then writing strategies which call vim.api.nvim_* operations that'd be missing)

[19:52:47] <JulianJulianBerm> so closer to the latter of the 2 of the choices you said
