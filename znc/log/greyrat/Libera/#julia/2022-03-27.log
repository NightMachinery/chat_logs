[09:46:30] <potatoe> Hi, I'm trying to understand how julia does multiprocessing. I have a const 2d matrix which is like 8MiB in size, and for testing I also have a simple function that sqrts it and assigns it to another variable, and then I modify a single element of the matrix. On my machine, with n=1, it takes 7s to allocate and run
[09:46:52] <potatoe> when I increase n=8 (nproc on my system), it goes upto 15
[09:48:05] <potatoe> I'm doing the multiprocessing by using pmap - is this increase in time taken to allocate and run purely because of the overhead it takes to setup the process?
[09:54:59] <adigitoleo> I'm guessing it is pmap overhead, see e.g. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55697905/difference-between-parallel-map-and-parallel-for-loop
[09:56:14] <adigitoleo> potatoe: I think pmap re-allocates on each worker, probably not suited for small tests like this
[09:57:25] <adigitoleo> so not just setup overhead but mainly communication overhead
[10:00:30] <adigitoleo> potatoe: In casasse you haven't seen it, https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/distributed-computing/#Parallel-Map-and-Loops
