[03:13:55] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: Due to their feeding and breeding habits house flies come into contact with a range of harmful bacteria such as Salmonella and E.coli. Because of this, house flies will often aid the spread of these bacteria passing them onto us by contaminating things, such as food and cooking utensils.
[03:14:13] <haise01> !flyfact
[03:14:13] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: Flies don‚Äôt have teeth. Instead, they have a long tongue called a proboscis, which sucks up food like a straw. Some flies drink nectar or blood. House flies like the food we eat. When a fly lands on your lunch, it vomits on the food. Acids in the vomit dissolve the food so the fly can suck it up. Disgusting!

[11:22:43] <DrZak> yea, i did go and said that i am no longer working with one project manager, since it is a waste of time as i am preparing the documents, making the timeline, and explaining thing to both him and the customer, this will save me three meetings a week
[11:22:46] <hunterkll> but more often than not, i could probably just sleep the entire day and no one would realize
[11:23:02] <DrZak> his boss was even more confused ..
[11:23:04] <bomb> do I have to be real idioy, or being declared idiot is enough for the neodiversity thing?
[11:23:20] <DrZak> i mean, the idiot who said the phrase - managers dont have to be technical - should've been shot
[11:23:31] <hunterkll> *shrug*
[11:23:32] <hunterkll> they don't
[11:23:32] <DrZak> 90% of fuckups happen coz managers arent technical
[11:23:51] <DrZak> yea, if they are managing potato stand
[11:23:51] <hunterkll> I prefer non-technical managers *who listen to their tech people*
[11:24:04] <DrZak> hm
[11:24:09] <DrZak> but they are useless then
[11:24:29] <hunterkll> no? Evaluations/reviews, people management, etc.... big portions of the job
[11:24:29] <DrZak> if the manager does what the tech says he should do, she/he's redundant
[11:24:46] <DrZak> since the tech guy can do it without a waste of oxygen taking up a parking lot space
[11:24:47] <bomb> it's like non-musical orchestra maestro
[11:24:49] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> sadly its not
[11:24:50] <hunterkll> my previous boss who retired a few years ago used to be technical..... when they were running VAX with greenscreen terminals in the office 
[11:25:10] <DrZak> hunterkll: those parts can/should be done by HR anyway
[11:25:12] <hunterkll> DrZak: nah, it's more "takes in advice and makes decisions based on input" 
[11:25:18] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> sometimes your job as a manager is to just make the call on stuff even if its the wrong call
[11:25:24] <hunterkll> someone's gotta make the call
[11:25:28] <hunterkll> ^ that
[11:25:55] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> we can tech forever but sometimes you got to just get behind something and push
[11:26:15] <hunterkll> I made my case for keeping SCOM around, and a (2 levels higher than mine) senior manager took my evaluation, agreed, and ordered the correct actions to be taken to enable me to consolidate the deployments
[11:26:30] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> and alot of the job of a manager is to povide top cover to your techs
[11:26:48] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> alot of that doesn't involve being that tech aware
[11:27:00] <hunterkll> he's technical 'enough' to understand when you explain things clearly, but primarily works to ensure me and my teams don't have roadblocks and gets stuff done/approved/etc for us 
[11:27:03] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> thats what yor team is for

[20:46:00] <Telgareith> and I just don't see the point from a pratical standpoint
[20:46:16] <fritzwastaken> its like 60 here, and its misting just a tiny bit
[20:46:18] <bomb> Telgareith right. in 2006 people were already using SHA-2
[20:46:28] <fritzwastaken> just went for a walk around the building and it was perfectly refreshing
[20:46:41] <Telgareith> Obviously you use the best hashing algo available at the time
[20:46:56] <Telgareith> and md5 is broken
[20:47:30] <Telgareith> but the only reason to break this md5 is to challenge your loan in court
[20:47:51] <Telgareith> and the court will be like "HAY WHATS THIS GARBAGE AT THE END OF THE FILE?"

[21:02:43] <sd> 06<o‚Äãnenerdyguy> my whole thought is more of having a single port of orchestration
[21:02:46] <sd> 06<o‚Äãnenerdyguy> vs 2
[21:03:26] <Telgareith> ansible is for configuration
[21:03:59] <Telgareith> in my mind
[21:04:46] <sd> 06<o‚Äãnenerdyguy> eh, ansible is for state presentation/config, awx/tower is for orchestration of that state
[21:06:39] <Telgareith> I'd have ansible tell the machine to go look at SCCM for updates personally
[21:06:57] <estranger> oh Lord @ trying to navigate a sales dude through an oss release plan... which is a jira with nested jiras with nested jiras
[21:06:59] <Telgareith> SCCM lets you control what updates go out when, or if they go out
[21:07:12] <estranger> shoot me

[21:07:17] <sd> 06<o‚Äãnenerdyguy> hmm. Seems like I need ot learn more SCCM

[21:09:46] <Telgareith> I know how to get performance out of my apps, some basic security, and a few other things
[21:10:29] <Telgareith> and I'm guessing what I call basic security is actually a fairly decent understanding
[21:10:51] <Telgareith> of the fundamentals and attacks that can be performed against what I use
[21:11:18] <Telgareith> like the unweildly long XML string
[21:11:20] <estranger> distributed systems ftw
[21:11:38] <Telgareith> work doesn't check for that
[21:11:45] <Telgareith> they got the error once
[21:11:56] <Telgareith> and replaced it with the maximum value possible
[21:12:12] <Telgareith> which is like 6tb?
[21:12:17] <estranger> my life is finding edge cases
[21:12:53] <estranger> a 6tb XML file would also want to make me shoot myself
[21:13:11] <Telgareith> I rejected the developers change to that

[21:14:18] <Telgareith> I should have left in 2017
[21:14:24] <Telgareith> but I was focused on the eclipse
[21:15:23] <int0x1C8> cool, got this autoupdate code implemented ezpz
[21:15:26] <Telgareith> in 2017 if you knew about docker you were good
[21:15:38] <Telgareith> now you have to know quite a bit about docker
[21:15:41] <Telgareith> and k8s
[21:16:07] *** Quits: mrghostman (~mrghostma@user/mrghostman) (Quit: leaving)
[21:16:48] <Telgareith> or kube if you prefer
[21:17:42] <int0x1C8> .net application on start up does a db query for the current active version, compares that to the version of the executing assembly, and if they don't match, it forks off a powershell script and exits itself
[21:18:06] <int0x1C8> the script then silent uninstalls, then installs the new version silently, then opens the application back up
[21:18:27] <Telgareith> what'd you use to do that?
[21:18:56] <Telgareith> One click deploy does that automagically
[21:19:45] <Telgareith> well, it checks the source location for a new version, not sql
[21:21:22] <int0x1C8> but then don't you have to manage the versions of both the actual executing application and the version of the installer
[21:21:43] <Telgareith> afaik no
[21:22:05] <Telgareith> we didn't have to on some utilities we made
[21:22:42] <int0x1C8> hmm, we're just using the VS installer project extension
[21:23:02] <Telgareith> which .net version?
[21:23:12] <Telgareith> if its 5 or 6, or core idk
[21:23:32] <int0x1C8> unfortunately this is still FW 4.7.1
[21:23:35] <PublicWifi> Found a box in the server closet that was labeled ‚Äúa drive for dell‚Äù
[21:23:46] <int0x1C8> now that I'm taking over dev I should switch it to core
[21:23:50] <PublicWifi> Opened it up.. it was literally the A Drive‚Ä¶ was a floppy drive
[21:23:51] <Telgareith> int0x1C8: work was on fw 1.1 when they laid me off
[21:23:59] <Telgareith> core is dead
[21:24:16] <Telgareith> it went like core 2.1 -> 3.1 -> 5 -> 6
[21:24:35] <int0x1C8> whatever, guess it's just .net now
[21:24:41] <Telgareith> literally
[21:24:45] <Telgareith> .net 5
[21:24:57] <Telgareith> vs .net framework 4.7.1
[21:25:24] <Telgareith> but seriously
[21:25:26] <Telgareith> fucking 1.1
[21:25:30] <Telgareith> smh
[21:25:40] <Telgareith> I got demoted for that too
[21:26:28] <int0x1C8> also why the fuck did the previous dev put the literal query strings in the data access layer instead of calling a stored proc
[21:26:34] <Telgareith> I pushed for a year for a developer devoted to upgrading all of our apps to a current .net version... in 2016
[21:26:49] <Telgareith> because SPROCs bad
[21:27:15] <int0x1C8> uh
[21:27:20] <int0x1C8> since when?
[21:27:30] <Telgareith> idk as long as I can remember
[21:27:40] <Telgareith> for basic queries you don't use SPROCs
[21:27:51] <Telgareith> business logic, no SPROC
[21:28:01] <int0x1C8> they decouple the application's data access layer from the db schema
[21:28:36] <Telgareith> not as much as you would think
[21:28:38] <int0x1C8> app doesn't need to know dick about the db schema, just exec this SP it gives you these results
[21:28:55] <Telgareith> its a nuanced topic
[21:29:26] <Telgareith> if you have SPROCs you also need a change policy for them as well
[21:29:47] <int0x1C8> well, they allow me to make minor logic tweaks and fixes without having to recompile and reinstall

[21:31:19] <Telgareith> without a proper associated DB change control structure you end up with ghost changes/fixes/regressions
[21:31:50] <int0x1C8> nothing about how we develop here is "proper"
[21:32:19] <Telgareith> *feels*
[21:33:06] <int0x1C8> I'm the one who got an internal git server running so we have some source control instead of just copying the project folder to a share and putting a timestamp in the folder name
[21:33:07] <Telgareith> I eventually got laid off because I wasn't producing fast enough, because I was doing it correctly
[21:33:14] <Telgareith> jfc

[21:33:24] <int0x1C8> except the other dev doesn't use the git I set up
[21:33:53] <Telgareith> I don't care if you can barely hello world
[21:33:56] <int0x1C8> he's like "how does that benefit me?"
[21:34:12] <Telgareith> if you use a VCS you're a better dev than the other guy
[21:34:47] <int0x1C8> but our in-house apps are single-dev
[21:34:50] <Telgareith> because when you've fucked your code so bad trying to do something you can roll back
[21:35:50] <Telgareith> honestly i'm getting depressed dealing with this
[21:36:00] <int0x1C8> he would say "I just go to the folder backup and paste over the files if I need to revert"
