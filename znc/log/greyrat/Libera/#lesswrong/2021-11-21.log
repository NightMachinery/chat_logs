[00:01:05] <quanticle> One thing I really appreciate about emacs is that the copy and paste commands are nowhere near each other. I've hit Ctrl-C when I've meant to paste so many times, overwriting whatever I had in my clipboard.
[00:01:33] <quanticle> And vice-versa: accidentally hitting Ctrl-V and overwriting whatever it is I meant to copy.

[00:07:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: How come feepbot responds to links in gwernpastes so fast, without the usual delay that lets Robomot respond first?
[00:08:02] <gwern> quanticle: I keep meaning to figure out how to write some WM keybindings to integrate with emacs registers so you can have a lot of independent pasteboards
[00:08:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: Get a multiple pasteboard thing
[00:08:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: For Mac there is ClipMenu
[00:09:03] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: oh, shit. um.
[00:09:14] <gwern> quanticle: I figure you should be able to combine 'xclip' and emacsclient's --eval=() CLI option to do something like bind Mod-{1-10} to the 1-10 registers so you can copy-paste from 10copy-paste commands
[00:09:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: Honestly, get ClipMenu regardless. It's one of the most important productivity-booster and general QOL-improvement things I've got installed on my Macs.
[00:09:51] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: I think cause it manually triggers the function to quote a link
[00:10:06] <feep> let me see if I can queue it up to check for obortitle instead
[00:10:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> thx
[00:10:26] <gwern> quanticle: so that 'Mod-1' would do something like 'emacs --eval=(set-register 1 "`xclip -o`"_', Mod-Shift-1 would then do 'emacs --eval=(get-register 1) | xclip -in', and so on
[00:11:32] <gwern> quanticle: then C-c Mod-1 to save text A, C-C Mod-2 to save text B, C-C Mod-3 to save text C, C-Shift-2 C-v to paste B, then change your mind about A and instead C-Shift-3 C-v to paste C
[00:11:35] <quanticle> Obormot\Arcturus: As much as your solution is appealing, convenient and eminently usable, I feel like what gwern is proposing is the true Hacker Way™
[00:11:52] <gwern> * Mod-Shift-3
[00:13:29] <quanticle> gwern: Well, I'm on Windows at the moment. However, what you're describing should still be doable, with a combination of emacsclient, AutoHotkey, and PowerShell's Set-Clipboard cmdlet (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/set-clipboard?view=powershell-7.2)
[00:13:30] <Robomot> Set-Clipboard (Microsoft.PowerShell.Management) - PowerShell | Microsoft Docs (The Set-Clipboard cmdlet sets the contents of the clipboard.  Note On Linux, this cmdlet requires the xclip utility to be in the path.)
[00:13:42] <gwern> quanticle: sure, but then you wouldn't have it in your emacs registers
[00:14:58] <gwern> (I think you can cut out the C-c/v by using xclip to read the selection without going through the copy-paste selection first, and xmonad *used* to have a 'putselection' module to write out the text to the current window which may or may not still work)
[00:15:15] * feep has to make some code changes...
[00:17:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: Perhaps for the best. The developer of ClipMenu seems to have dropped off the face of the Earth. Even the download links are broken now...
[00:18:23] <gwern> really, integrating window managers/shells with emacs from the outside is probably underestimated by emacs users. --eval is there, guys, roll whatever you want with it!

[00:22:27] <two2thehead> kuudes, s0ph1a feep : "Before Taproot's implementation, verification of transactions on Bitcoin's network was slow because each digital signature was validated against a public key. This method multiplied the amount of time required for complex multi-sig transactions that require multiple inputs and signatures.  
[00:22:27] <two2thehead> The Taproot implementation enables signature aggregation. In simple words, this means that multiple signatures can be batched together and validated. The benefit for multi-sig transactions—or transactions that require signoffs from multiple parties—is even more pronounced since the upgrade condenses transactions containing many inputs, such as those from multiple addresses on Bitcoin's network, into a single one."

[00:49:29] <feep> gwern: thank you, edited
[00:49:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> An horse indeed
[00:50:01] <feep> op is an horse
[00:51:57] <gwern> I am reminded of a joke. an old man is out walking when he meets a farmer, and they discuss his animals and the nearby horse. the farmer says, "that's the most remarkable horse you've ever seen." Why's that? "Because that horse told me he had a PhD in French literature from Harvard." The old man exclaims, shaking in rage, "That is an outrageous lie, sir! I teach French at Harvard and I've...
[00:52:03] <gwern> ...never seen that horse in my life!"
[00:52:31] <feep> I .. don't get it
[00:52:53] <Obormot\Gaia> lol
[00:56:39] <quanticle> They're ignoring the fact that the horse can talk
[00:56:58] <quanticle> I guess feep is so used to talking animal-girls that the concept is not longer remarkable for him
[00:57:22] <feep> oh, the horse told him. right. I overread that.
[00:57:29] <quanticle> "Ah yes, of course the horses can speak, it's just like Uma Musume Pretty Derby"
[00:58:06] <feep> I mean, if you immediately ignore that part and assume the farmer is the source of all information about the horse, it makes sense, right?
[00:58:13] <feep> the scam has fallen apart due to an unfortunate choice of victim
[00:58:55] <feep> like
[00:59:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> The joke is that the old man has no problem with the alleged fact that the horse can talk
[00:59:01] <feep> the horse doesn't *actually talk* in the joke.
[00:59:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> He doesn't say "the horse told you? ridiculous, horses can't talk, lol"
[00:59:28] <feep> well, that's correct tho
[00:59:42] <gwern> that's why I was reminded of the joke, because if a horse could program, that would be very remarkable and being a horse in programming would be an extraordinary thing
[00:59:48] <feep> he wouldn't say that, because that's an immediate setup for "how dare you sir, come with me and I will demonstrate to you the locquacious power of my horse"
[00:59:50] <feep> and then you get robbed
[00:59:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> -_-
[01:00:07] <feep> whereas the harvard gotcha is instant and he doesn't have to go anywhere
[01:00:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's true but only because the horse has already demonstrated its willingness to lie about its academic pedigree
[01:00:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> So yes, it could also turn out to be a common criminal
[01:00:30] <feep> lol
[01:00:37] <feep> I mean, the horse cannot actually talk, that's the point
[01:00:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> Can't it, though
[01:00:42] <feep> that's just an excuse to get you to go in the barn
[01:00:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> Maybe this is the horse from the Nasruddin story
[01:01:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> Maybe Nasruddin really did teach it to talk
[01:01:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> He was a pretty clever guy, you know
[01:02:00] <feep> okay, maybe the horse can talk, the point is it talking is not at all necessary to the events unfolding.
[01:02:39] <quanticle> Maybe you should be less than #lesswrong for once and stop overanalyzing this joke.
[01:02:57] <quanticle> Stop beating the dead (joke) horse, as it were

[01:23:39] <kuudes> sure
[01:23:49] <feep> the open carrying is illegal, but if someone comes at you and you shoot them it's still self-defense.
[01:23:59] <kuudes> indeed. but that was my point. over here each of them carrying would have done a crime

[01:30:48] <gwern> ...people stick to it. hence headlines about rittenhouse being acquitted of shooting 3 black men
[01:31:10] <feep> ah right.
[01:31:20] <feep> because that's still "the story"
[01:31:22] <gwern> this is why sailer rejoices in these sorts of cases. the media is too ideological and dumb to hold back. instead, every black dude is jesus, and every white dude is adolf hitler in a klan hood

[01:32:41] <feep> makes sense
[01:33:16] <two2thehead> histrionics according to my spellcheck
[01:33:21] <gwern> quanticle: no, it's a typo. even though that makes more sense etymologically imo
[01:33:40] <quanticle> My prior is that you're better at English than I am, hence the confusion
[01:34:24] <gwern> if rittenhouse had somehow evaded notice until now, and surfaced as a package, with everything about his job in kenosha to the legality of his gun, people would be a lot more circumspect about it. it would not go viral, any more than all of the white people shot by police or other white people go viral. unfortunately, done is done
[01:35:40] <gwern> somewhere, there is probably someone still arguing that Dreyfus was a spy, or that the rosenbergs were innocent
[01:35:59] <feep> right right

[10:02:31] <rsaarelm> JuliusBranson's protracted datasectretslox meltdown really reminds me of AutisticThinker over at reddit some years ago.

[11:30:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> These are such horrible discussions and these people have such bad takes on everything, I mean just all of them, everyone in these threads is so wrong and terrible

[11:33:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> They think they've figured out what to think, but they still have no idea *how* to think

[13:30:39] <shawwwn> excellent
[13:30:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> "In 1955, Soviet atomic scientists, for the first time, met their Western counterparts at the Geneva conference. It turned out that our men of science were just like their Western colleagues: same lifestyle, same habits, same sense of humor.
[13:30:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> During the breaks between conference sessions, the scientists chatted eagerly. Suddenly an exclamation was heard: 'So you're from Berdichev [a town in Ukraine] too?!'
[13:30:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> That was the Soviet physicist Feinberg, talking to the director of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Weinberg. It turned out that they were not only countrymen, but even distant relations."
[13:31:26] <PapuaHardyNet> my favorite generated line: 'CNNs were first developed by Jürgen Schmidhuber of the Swiss AI Lab at University of Neuchatel in 1988, and have quickly since become the method of choice for computer vision.'
[13:31:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> (That would be https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_M._Weinberg )
[13:31:32] <Robomot> Alvin M. Weinberg - Wikipedia (Alvin Martin Weinberg (/ˈwaɪnbɜːrɡ/; April 20, 1915 – October 18, 2006) was an American nuclear physicist who was the administrator at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) during and after the Manhattan Project. He came to Oak Ridge, Tennessee, in 1945 and remained there until his death in 2006. He was the first to use the term "Faustian bargain" to describe nuclear energy.)

[13:45:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> 'The technology has to be perfected,' protested the engineers.
[13:45:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> 'Don't even try it!' retorted Vannikov. 'See that doormat there? Just as it was laying there before, so it'll stay there! Innovators are the worst enemies of stability in production!'"

[13:45:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> (If only such people were in charge of modern software development)
[13:45:48] <shawwwn> also getting murdered doesn't really count as dying during sex

[13:49:55] <kuudes> oh
[13:50:06] <shawwwn> but with multiple quotes around them because I don't buy it
[13:50:25] <shawwwn> one died by getting murdered while plonking some bloke's wife
[13:50:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... well? How many?

[13:57:44] <Urchin[emacs]> shawwwn: the article you probably found seems to mix up popes, wikipedia claims Pope John XII in 964, with differing accounts of stroke, hammer to the head by the husband, or thrown out the window by the husband; Leo VII in 965, who died of a stroke, also during adultery

[14:26:11] <PapuaHardyNet> arch linux using dwm, but seriously it isn't a window manager issue. It is some combination of CPU throttling due to Firefox bloat, and some stupid Firefox code, that makes it drop what I type

[15:02:02] <PapuaHardyNet> are you saying the official arch package build is bad, or that I should update? Either way, you do make sense, but I am afraid of updating software
[15:02:35] <PapuaHardyNet> I've taken immense pains to avoid updating my kernel, and only did it to attempt to use zfs, which was too complicated for me to use anyway
[15:07:14] <dv^_^> If you don't like updates why are you using arch? That's a rolling release bleeding-edge distribution
[15:09:34] <pie_> the closest i have is if i type into the url bar and hit enter too fast
[15:09:45] <pie_> my text goes in but the actual query gets the end chopped off
[15:10:02] <PapuaHardyNet> what? arch is super stable
[15:10:23] <PapuaHardyNet> I don't even need to do a rolling release update everytime I want to install something
[15:10:47] <PapuaHardyNet> and the main reason why arch is because of the ease of installing packages and the support of arch wiki (the wiki and the irc)
[15:11:02] <PapuaHardyNet> AUR is also amazing
[15:11:32] <PapuaHardyNet> (re rolling release: i need to update the kernel at times to install things, but that is very rare. And arch has never died on me.)

[20:20:18] <Robomot> John Arnold (@JohnArnoldFndtn): "Oil companies price gouged from 2005-08, stopped for the next 2 years, gouged again from '10-'14, inexplicably reversed the policy for the next 6 years leading to widespread bankruptcies, and then restarted this year.

[20:58:09] <kuudes> what
[20:59:35] <kuudes> you are being too socratic, so I just presume you are about to try some sort of cognitive swindle, and this reduces my motivation to engage with you
[21:00:53] <Gurkenglas> I had no particular swindle in mind! I'm trying to see your details, and open to strike at inconsistencies if you happen to display any :P
[21:01:04] <PapuaHardyNet> hahahah
[21:02:28] <Gurkenglas> Is it good to have children because the alternative is that we all will end up helpless once old?
[21:03:10] <kuudes> one thing that #lesswrong has taught me is to be less of a quokka and just deny engagement from people who are likely not useful, if I want or need
[21:03:28] <PapuaHardyNet> what's a quokka
[21:03:29] <kuudes> basicly turning more toward conflict theory in some cases than mistake theory, I suppose
[21:03:34] <kuudes> PapuaHardyNet, huh
[21:03:47] <kuudes> its a local meme about people who are too trusting
[21:04:18] <PapuaHardyNet> I think gurkenglas is an elite nerd sniper
[21:04:20] <feep> be less qokkic
[21:04:38] <feep> PapuaHardyNet: it's a cuddly animal that lives on an island where it has no natural predators
[21:04:44] <PapuaHardyNet> cute
[21:04:51] <feep> as a result when it sees a human it runs up to them curiously
[21:05:02] <feep> it is utterly without fear of threat
[21:05:26] <feep> some rationalists follow this exciting strategy with strangers on the internet
[21:05:33] <feep> it occasionally fails to work out
[21:06:11] <feep> the point of quokkas as a meme is "keep in mind that some people *do not want to be friends with you*"
[21:06:12] <PapuaHardyNet> lol yeah
[21:06:17] <feep> "and do in fact enjoy harming you"
[21:06:45] <feep> "don't just run up to every new person excitedly, being like "look! here's 20 things you could socially hurt me with""
[21:07:06] <Gurkenglas> i guess that instinct *is* where terrorist organizations get their engineers. but also where eliezer got their rationalists. who wasn't pulled out of christianity?
[21:07:16] <PapuaHardyNet> do I do that? I think I do that here :|
[21:07:27] <feep> well it's okay, this is a reasonably safe space
[21:07:39] <kuudes> yes
[21:07:43] <feep> it's more that some people do it on like
[21:07:45] <feep> twitter
[21:07:53] <feep> or   their company breakroom
[21:08:27] <PapuaHardyNet> that requires someone to be really sheltered or on non-neurotypical
[21:08:33] <feep> YES YES IT DOES
[21:08:34] <feep> <33
[21:12:03] <Gurkenglas> kuudes, can you suggest some modification to the protocol through which I poke at people's models that will make it more distinguishable from trying to hurt people?

[22:57:40] <two2thehead> "It seems many trans people are drawn to both speedrunning and bullet hells for similar reasons. The gameplay experiences of bullet-hells have a lot in common with speedrunning. Those who play bullet hells will typically grind the game in order to better their high score, similar to how a speedrunner grinds a game to better their time. Perhaps, a reason trans people are drawn to both is because they want a prestigious gaming experience where they can 
[22:57:41] <two2thehead> compete with other gamers in solitude. I noticed there are far more openly trans people in speedrunning compared to other esports, possibly because attending and competing in video game tournaments publicly must feel like an intimidating endeavor for many trans people, especially those who feel like they don't pass."
[23:01:07] <kuudes> rmmh, oh, btw, over here they have found out that massive fraction of moose collisions happen within +-1 hours of sunset and sundawn
[23:01:25] <kuudes> moose move at that time much more, they change positions; otherwise they stay more dormant and eat and ruminate
[23:02:04] <kuudes> so if you are driving in a place where similar animals cause car accidents, might be wise to take that into account and adjust travel times
