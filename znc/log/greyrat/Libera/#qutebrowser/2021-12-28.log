[08:44:36] <emanuele6> noex: i see "Video unavailable" "The uploader has not made this video available in your country."
[08:44:49] <emanuele6> since it is a youtube movies upload it is not surprising
[08:45:26] <noex> i just see "your browser can't play this video"
[08:46:55] <noex> then if i click "learn more" it tells me that my browser is great and can work with youtube
[08:47:43] <emanuele6> that video is pay-per-view and region locked since it is a youtube movies video
[08:47:54] <noex> it says "Free"
[08:48:30] <noex> that's why I clicked on it
[08:48:32] <emanuele6> maybe in your country
[08:48:40] <emanuele6> oh, wait
[08:48:58] <emanuele6> i realised something. that video is probably using some proprietary movie drm
[08:49:22] <emanuele6> you need to install something to decode those
[08:49:51] <noex> is that widevine or whatever
[08:50:01] <emanuele6> yes, widevine
[08:51:20] <emanuele6> do you have widevine installed? if not, that is probably why you can't view the video even though it is not region locked for you
[08:53:10] <noex> nah, i saw it was available but did not install it
[08:53:18] <noex> that makes sense
[08:53:43] <noex> it said used for netflix, but it makes sense this is probably the same thing
[08:53:54] <emanuele6> yeah
[08:55:34] <noex> https://i.imgur.com/NuVYf8K.jpg
[08:56:01] <emanuele6> hehe
[08:56:11] <emanuele6> "free" videos
[08:56:23] <noex> true lol
[08:59:38] <noex> i was less interested in watching the video and more interested in figuring out why it wouldn't play tbh. probably not worth installing the proprietary extension at least at the moment.

[19:13:54] *** Joins: calciumdeficient (~anukulmoz@2001:470:69fc:105::ba0f)
[19:19:49] <emanuele6> noex: yes, qutebrowser does not handle those itself
[19:20:25] <emanuele6> you need to create a .desktop file for your mailto handler and set `MimeType=x-scheme-handler/mailto;' in it
[19:20:43] <emanuele6> see https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/5303#issuecomment-819249441 for an example
[19:33:13] <noex> emanuele6: awesome thanks
[19:54:16] <noex> i wonder if that same issue could apply to gemini and gopher links
[19:54:44] <noex> both gemini links and mailto links just open in a blank tab because i'm guessing there's no handler for them
[20:04:15] <winny> This may interest you - this got me sorted out with mailto and friends https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/XDG_MIME_Applications#mimeapps.list

[22:28:00] <Nickli> is there a way to have more than one type of eleent for hints eg: links and images?
[22:55:16] <emanuele6> Nickli: you can define a new selector in your config.py file
[22:55:29] <emanuele6> e.g.   c.hints.selectors['images+links'] = c.hints.selectors['images'] + c.hints.selectors['links']
