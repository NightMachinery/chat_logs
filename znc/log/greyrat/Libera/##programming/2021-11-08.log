[00:00:23] <InPhase> pulse: The primary reason I turned autocomplete OFF in vim after getting it working, is that the popups were blocking code visibility.

[00:01:55] <apotheon> I think the next time you say it you'll sound like a broken record.
[00:02:02] <oldlaptop> bob518: I don't see how redis is genuinely comparable to and database that's designed to be permanent. (Which is not to say it's not more useful than the other trendy "nosql" databases - besides, its author is tcl people, obviously a man of taste)
[00:02:06] <pulse> Well as long as I don't sound like a broken VHS
[00:02:22] <apotheon> I used to say MySQL was the database you used when you didn't care about your data, but then MongoDB came along and said "Hold my beer."
[00:02:59] <oldlaptop> apotheon: and then redis set out to actually meet that requirement in all seriousness :D

[00:03:44] <bob518> oldlaptop which one is designed to be permanent?
[00:03:45] <apotheon> PostgreSQL+Redis can be pretty practical.
[00:03:59] <oldlaptop> bob518: It's more that redis is explicitly designed *not* to be.

[01:44:03] <arahael> pyzozord: for example, in haskell you can basically have functions that take a type and return a type.

[02:08:22] <pyzozord> not sure. I am saying: allow metacode, in metacode programmer can define whatever type system they need (or any other system they need)
[02:08:29] <pyzozord> arahael: ^
[02:09:24] <sonny> I don't get it
[02:09:38] <Decker> think that was sorta the basis of vendu's system
[02:10:06] <sonny> if the ast has types, then you have a type system ...
[02:10:35] <pyzozord> no those are types of ast nodes, that's a different thing
[02:10:45] <sonny> no, it's the same thing
[02:10:51] <pyzozord> no, it's a different thing
[02:10:55] <Decker> the point is - not only have the base types builtin, but add additional information to them and others... 
[02:11:01] <arahael> pyzozord: haskell already allows the dev to do that with the type system
[02:11:13] <sonny> what is different?
[02:11:23] <pyzozord> level of abstraction

[02:12:18] <Decker> sonny the type checking for deeper information may be done at runtime well after the AST
[02:12:36] <arahael> that's a bit late isnt it?
[02:12:49] <sonny> no, that's what dynamic type system do
[02:13:01] <Decker> attributes/decorators for example let you say 'this is a plugin module' and you can query for 'find all plugin modules' and run what you get back
[02:13:13] <Decker> it would be a dynamic type system
[02:13:43] <arahael> Decker: they still need to conform to an agreed type though!
[02:14:02] <pyzozord> I just don't think that "type" is enough
[02:14:07] <Decker> agrees - but there may be times things use a type that they aren't really a plugin
[02:14:14] <pyzozord> and also I think there is too much of "type" around right now
[02:14:28] <Decker> it's really not - it's often sufficient... find all types that implement X interface

[02:20:26] <sonny> sure
[02:20:26] <pyzozord> types is just one of them
[02:20:33] <sonny> it's the best way
[02:20:59] <arahael> you can achieve similar with test cases but you need a LOT of test cases.
[02:21:03] <sonny> it's also the fastest way, you are just going to end up reinventing it 
[02:21:17] <arahael> you still need tests with a good type system, but not nearly as many.
[02:21:32] <sonny> maybe even none
[02:21:41] <pyzozord> elaborate type systems seem counter productive to me
[02:21:47] <arahael> depends on the problem space, yeah.
[02:21:50] <pyzozord> I'd rather get a fishing rod, not the fish

[02:24:25] <arahael> pyzozord: well, typescript's type system is a hack designed to be used in a world where the majority of (javascript) devs are against the notion of a type system :)
[02:24:56] <sonny> never used typescript, I'm guessing it uses a nominal type system?
[02:25:11] <pyzozord> well not just javascript devs, original C by Richie was typeless as well

[02:47:11] <arahael> Decker: Which langauge?
[02:47:14] <Decker> C++
[02:47:40] <pyzozord> arahael: unless the type system could read my mind, I don't think there is a perfect type system for me out there
[02:47:41] <arahael> Decker: Ah, well, C++ is a bit awkward there, but in C++ at least you can use value semantics
[02:47:49] <Decker> which - references are only really the latter... so they shouldn't have been used in the first place :)
[02:48:02] <Decker> but that's still a copy

[06:00:45] <pulse> Hmm
[06:00:46] <Inst> imo haskell is badly taught because new haskellers are beaten over the head with like 43928 different abstractions at the very start

[06:01:03] <Inst> i'm just crazy

[06:01:18] <arahael> Inst: You mean 43929 different abstractions? ;) (There's always one more)
[06:01:28] <Inst> is to get people into main do land
[06:01:33] <Inst> which allows them to code in a quasi imperative way
[06:01:44] <Inst> then get them io asap
[06:02:00] <Inst> then introduce them gradually to the abstractions, making them compile each time
[06:02:22] <Inst> Haskell has for loops in libraries iirc
[06:02:39] <Inst> but since that's not an integral part of the language, instead of for loops, start teaching recursion etc at that stage
[06:03:03] <Inst> and get them to build multiple functions ASAP

[06:12:09] <Square> I want to describe how a state can be changed into a human readable visual form. I tried use automatas, but discovered they grow semi-exponentially by the dimensions (and each dimensions possible values) of your state. Contemplating BPMN, that has no formal proof, which feels a bit shaky (and could possibly just help me describe allowed states and not every transition). Petri Nets seems to be an alternative to BPMN but allows modelling of non deterministic 
[06:12:09] <Square> behaviour, which i dont need and seems to add a bit of wonkyness. Are there more formal models of describing processes / states that are more limited but possibly easier to deal with?     
[06:12:12] <InPhase> Inst: I think firstly you need a good bit of comfort with functions themselves before you can even start.  So that has to be built up.  And the inductive step is a serious challenge for a lot of people.

[06:36:12] <Inst> jeez, /s/ strikethrough failed me
[06:36:25] <Square> Im probably the wrong person to answer that in a proper way. I see it as a way to both support lazy evaluation and also to write expressions of boxed values.

[06:37:03] <Inst> i'm also suspecting that monads might have been dropped into the language for a very specific reason (to handle IO), but people found out that monads were useful for more than that
[06:37:14] <Inst> tardis monad, even if I don't understand it, is amazing

[06:37:31] <Inst> i.e, it can somehow exploit lazy evaluation to go back in time
[06:37:42] <Inst> within some abstract quality of the program, of course
[06:37:43] <Square> its formalism, that has attached proofs and gives a bunch of traits / possibilities for your to do lazy eval / monad io / work with boxed types

[06:39:12] <Inst> i need to get this done tonight

[07:53:10] <pingpongball> Hey guys, i've a very emergency qeustion
[07:53:19] <pingpongball> I've hacked somebody udemy account.
[07:53:29] <pingpongball> which have alot of courses paid.
[07:53:36] <Inst> oh god, kill me
[07:53:54] <Inst> still getting screwed by attempts to do c bindings to nativefiledialog
[07:54:14] <pingpongball> after hacking i felt guilty and emailed him to take udemy on promise me to learn from it.

[07:54:57] <pingpongball> he is not warning me

[07:55:41] <PlanckWalk> Cool story bro.  You should write a romance next.
[07:55:51] <adder`> yeah and don't forget to get your head checked
[07:56:05] <pingpongball> but i'm from nepal , hes from usa
[07:56:09] <pingpongball> fBI is not in nepal
[07:56:24] <PlanckWalk> Long distance relationships can work sometimes, especially if you write them well.
[07:57:26] <pingpongball> i'm confused, should i go bad way takeover his udemy or tell him . first time telling he just changed didnt messaged me , second time he is messaging. i dont know if he would give me courses to learn.
[07:58:26] <pingpongball> actually scared of FBI

[07:58:58] <adder`> fear of FBI is not irrational
[07:59:09] <jtgd> FBI does not work outside of U.S.
[07:59:30] <adder`> under whose jurisdiction are international waters
[08:00:12] <pingpongball> He had bought about hundreds of udemy courses .
[08:00:14] <jtgd> maybe he could notify Nepalese authorities to deal with you.
[08:00:42] <InPhase> pingpongball: Maybe just stop trying to break into things, and use the large numbers of free learning resources all over the Internet.
[08:00:56] <pingpongball> ok,
[08:01:05] <pingpongball> i should give him back:)
[08:01:23] <adder`> does anybody pay for udemy courses anyway
[08:01:39] <pingpongball> yes there are torrents thousands of them
[08:05:11] <InPhase> adder`: $125 million in revenue, $12/course, so I'd estimate about 10 million courses per year paid for?
[08:05:50] <InPhase> adder`: 40 million users, so that's 1/4th of a course per year per registered user.
[08:06:00] <adder`> I remember seeing something like this https://udemyfreecourses.org/
[08:06:01] <bayaz> Title: All Udemy FREE courses (daily updated) - UdemyFreeCourses.org 
[08:07:05] <adder`> ah, there's a catch here, it's not this link, but I've seen something similar to this that includes all courses
[08:08:32] <adder`> yeah it's in top 5 hits when you search for 'free udemy courses'
[08:09:39] <adder`> so maybe a more interesting figure would be revenue /lost/ to sites like that one

[14:26:04] <Decker> sorta by definition it has to work as proved out by the math

[14:27:37] <mrig> I should go take a look at the library I suppose, It is more that the complex is a type was my thought, I suppose that is really not that different from a typedefed struct though
[14:27:47] <arahael> mrig: In a sense, there is no difference between using an operator and a function call, except operators tend to be infix and functions tend to be prefix.  And operators tend to be symbols, and functions tend to be alphanumeric.
[14:27:49] <mrig> thought
[14:28:07] <mrig> right it really is a matter of syntax.
[14:28:09] <arahael> mrig: And internally when using a compiler, it'll convert operators to functions.
[14:28:16] <arahael> (For the most part)
[14:28:40] <Decker> I mean you can see that the 'operator overloads' are functions...
[14:29:27] <mrig> I have rewritten c++ code in the past, that was using operator overloading for vectors, but did not use complex numbers then.

[14:37:02] <Decker> 38 ... df().then( df=>df.head.print() )
[14:37:02] <TJ-> ok
[14:37:22] <teut> ya this code prints the dataframe
[14:37:22] <TJ-> ok
[14:37:25] <Decker> because async is an early return with an unresolved promise to the caller
[14:37:25] <TJ-> ok
[14:37:30] <Decker> (err await )
[14:38:26] <teut> so what about the object in the code which are using the response of the awaited
[14:38:32] <teut> objects*
[14:38:45] <teut> what happens to them in case of failure ?
[14:38:53] <Decker> a reject happens?
[14:39:08] <Decker> basically that's an exception
[14:39:16] <Decker> if .catch() isn't used
[14:39:25] <Decker> so you'd use try{} catch(){} instead

[18:16:01] <dodo> the interesting thing about a blockchain that is that it allows to transfer information without trusting any party
[18:16:06] <oldlaptop> those are very interesting properties
[18:16:12] <dodo> yup
[18:16:35] <dodo> but 99% of the blockchain stuff is just mindless marketing 
[18:16:37] <mishugana> and the massive power consumption ... is it really worth that? I know, that's specific to some people/agencies mining stuff, but still.
[18:17:15] <dodo> that's not really a tech question, so i'll abstain :)

[18:23:11] <mishugana> zzz: lmfao
[18:23:25] <dodo> mishugana: and then you modify the blockchain to make it mutable, because the business case requires that

[18:43:57] <Decker> busybox
[18:44:37] <oldlaptop> I would not think the intended bug is in busybox, but instead some "web app" that can be tricked into making that busybox call.

[18:44:41] <Decker> ya ff isn't valid utf8
[18:44:51] <Decker> so it'd have to be a binary fragment, but it's not elf
[18:45:02] <oldlaptop> and therefore uploading, probably, a compiled binary or something to that "downloader" file in a few dozen/hundred POSTs
[18:45:30] <Decker> oh that's just an append right?
[18:45:39] <oldlaptop> presumably the last POST tries to execute "downloader" and "downloader" then does something evil

[18:46:44] <bugweiser> yeah, it appears to try to append to something called 'downloader'

[19:20:12] <bugweiser> oldlaptop, I lost the link, but i seen a shell-script to 'streamline' echo into portability.. it was about 60 lines of feature detection and checking if printf was there and worked better.
[19:20:30] <oldlaptop> The smart way to do that is just use printf.
[19:20:43] <oldlaptop> Define your own echo as a shell function that calls printf if you simply must.

[21:13:22] <jeaye> Fault: Each has their own benefits, and my approach will be different, but they're general purpose langs for a reason.
[21:14:03] <pyzozord> I think the question about favorite language kind of implies favorite approach in it
[21:14:20] <jeaye> Fault: That's entirely unfair, again, an analogy. The difference between something like Python and Rust is not the difference between building a house with a hammer versus building a house with a whole tool box.

[21:17:34] <bugweiser> (or so SO-surveys say)
[21:18:07] <jeaye> Even in situations where tools have different purposes, it's not "ridiculous" to have a favorite. For example, with musical instruments, each has a different range, perhaps a different method of generating sound, and a different means of playing it, but they can all effectively play the same music. However, most of us who play music will have a favorite instrument, Fault.

[21:18:34] <pyzozord> I agree with that too ^
[21:19:04] <jeaye> Why? Because we're not Vulcan and the process isn't reduced to "the right instrument". Lots of instruments will do the trick and we likely have a favorite one.
[21:19:11] <bugweiser> for me it literally boils down to language and capability_in_standard_box .
[21:19:16] <pyzozord> there is overlap between 'tool for the job' and 'fovorite tool' because 1) there are multiple tools for the job usually and 2) people prefer different jobs

[21:23:08] <bugweiser> well.. hmm.. This is a programming channel and I guess asking what everyone's favorite programming language is is on par with semicolon vs semicolon-free, or single vs double quotes or tab vs spaces  or or braces first or on end of function  or comma-first vs comma-last  (and while on the subject, behaviour of trailing comma in array literals) and ...

[22:46:20] <Jck_true> WinForms isn't supported under linux. But is under Mono. Then someone told me .NET6 is natively supported under linux. So I updated. But of course not the WinForms stuff, so now I'm looking at Xamarin just to see how complicated it is
