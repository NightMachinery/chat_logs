[00:19:21] <lmat> My trackpad is pretty messed up. I have to press pretty hard to get the mouse to register, but often I wind up pressing hard enough that the hardware click happens (Lenovo Yoga 9i or something). light-touch clicking, right-clicking, scrolling, etc. doesn't work. It almost seems like the synaptics driver isn't working at all...I'm not sure how to diagnose.
[00:19:26] <lmat> I have xf86-input-synaptics installed.
[00:19:30] <lmat> Oh yeah, when I move the mouse, it only moves a bit, then stops moving. I have to lift my finger and touch again to try to get it to move a bit more.

[06:46:18] <Jiogen> I would be careful, if your intention is to use the container as a security device BAD IDEA, use a VM
[06:47:04] <jaawerth> lsrtl__: I believe the robust way would to use -e and/or ENV to pass in $DISPLAY, and -v to bind-mount $HOME/.Xauthority to the same location in the container. therem ight be another bind mount you need too.. /tm/.X11-unix maybe, if you search those terms abit there are howtos out there, but yes this does somewhat defeat the purpose of using a container

[06:47:20] <jaawerth> alternatively you could ssh into it with X11 forwarding ;-)
[06:48:00] <jaawerth> or run vnc/nx from it, but that would be a little extreme, I'd probably ust use a vm at that point
[06:48:27] <jaawerth> well I guess it depends on why you're using it from a container
[06:48:48] <Jiogen> from the web browser I assume they want to use it as a secure browsing thing
[06:48:51] <Jiogen> but that is a bad idea
[06:50:05] <novns> jaawerth, yes, I know, I did this for that host.  thank you!
[06:51:50] <jaawerth> if it isnt for extra security and is instead just to isolate its environment + data dirs then you'd be fine, though I think other than ~/.mozilla, firefox supports the XDG dirs spec these days so you could do that instead and use an appimage

[11:54:58] <angel_de_vicente> Hi, the parallel package in community is out-of-date for about 14 months now (https://archlinux.org/packages/community/any/parallel/).

[11:55:31] <angel_de_vicente> What should be the right approach in these cases? (long-time Arch-Linux user here, but never packaged anything before)

[11:56:04] <NetSysFire> there is #archlinux-aur
[11:56:23] <LowTax> yeah, but if it's already in community, he should probably not duplicate it in AUR
[11:56:32] <NetSysFire> yes, this is why i mentioned -git packages
[11:56:42] <daspork> LowTax hacked up a webapp to run on my server that takes a key and the url i want to DL and adds them to a queue, then a worker that processes the queue and manages status of the itmes
[11:56:48] <NetSysFire> parallel-git would fit perfectly
[11:56:49] <daspork> ~100 lines of python
[11:57:20] <LowTax> daspork:right okay, but where do you get the URL from? 
[11:57:35] <LowTax> NetSysFire:oh okay, didn't see that
[11:57:37] <daspork> it takes the site url of what you want to download
[11:57:48] <daspork> read the webpage 
[11:57:50] <angel_de_vicente> ok, thanks, I will try the parallel-git approach then. That way I'll learn to package something for AUR (even if parallel in community gets up to date at some later point)
[11:57:56] <LowTax> daspork: so it tries to download the entire site? -- alright will do

[12:50:10] <Namarrgon> if you need those, yes.
[12:50:26] <Namarrgon> you still have systemd-networkd, if that suits your needs

[12:51:02] <DilithiumNO3> I'm asking about whatever's absolutely necessary to get ethernet running
[12:51:20] <Namarrgon> what is necessary depends on the user-case.
[12:51:46] <DilithiumNO3> ...graphical desktop, probably KDE but might use XFCE or MATE or awesomewm
[12:52:30] <DilithiumNO3> so in other words, install a network management service of choice, be it netctl, networkmanager, systemd-networkd or whatever?
[12:52:54] <Namarrgon> the DE or color of your shirt doesn't really matter. how do you connect to the internet?
[12:53:19] <DilithiumNO3> onboard Ethernet, later onboard Wi-Fi
[12:53:49] <Namarrgon> if dhcp is available on the network then you can use systemd-networkd and don't need to install any additional packages
[12:54:00] <Namarrgon> for wifi you need a supplicant
[12:54:09] <DilithiumNO3> a wpa_supplicant you mean? yeah I know
[12:54:25] <Namarrgon> for example, yes
[12:55:32] <Gagis> you can recommend some default choise you know. I think I went with networkmanager since its familiar from most other distros and none of the options have major downsides I'd care about
[12:55:49] <DilithiumNO3> alright, I'll enable systemd-networkd at first then install networkmanager and switch to that

[17:35:20] <baltazar> hi! is there a way to get http request headers that my browser (chromium) sends when downloading a file? I want to download that same file with curl, but it's failing
[17:35:32] <Hackerpcs> F12?
[17:35:47] <Hackerpcs> Firefox also has a ready curl option too
[17:36:03] *** Quits: Wladimir (~doforlove@user/doforlove33) (Quit: Leaving)
[17:36:30] <baltazar> Hackerpcs: chrome does for normal requests as well, but when I click the download link it opens a new tab that closes immediately, so I don't know how to attach devtools to it
[17:37:52] <drocan> baltazar: F12, then F5 to get request row back on there, then right click copy as curl or something
[17:37:54] <baltazar> ah, I managed to get it by removing the target="_blank" from the link
[17:40:05] <baltazar> damn. apparently it's the user agent. why do people do this
[17:41:13] <ishitatsuyuki> it's almost always the UA ;)
[17:42:13] <baltazar> in this case, followup question is, is there a way to make `makepkg` set this as the user agent? I assume not
[17:42:20] <baltazar> (this is for a package)
[17:42:36] <ishitatsuyuki> yeah no
[17:42:40] <ishitatsuyuki> can you mirror it?
