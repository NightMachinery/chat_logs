[19:04:22] <twysamz> anyone looking for a new position as a senior devsecops engineer?
[19:59:47] <Joel> The only thing more sus than a devops title is devsecops imho
[20:06:06] <twysamz> there is a plan to change the titling... it's honestly more orchestration, handling pipelines and the clusters
[20:12:27] <kwilczynski> twysamz: What does it include?
[20:12:49] <kwilczynski> twysamz: Or is it just a bit of a sugary bite for potential candidates? :)
[20:13:36] <kwilczynski> "Here... apply for this sweet sweet looking position... doing amazing things!" [Narrator: no you won't; popelines in Azure DevOps until you draw your last breath]
[20:13:38] <twysamz> I can throw the 'official' responsibilities in the channel if you want, just didn't wanna get in yelled at
[20:15:22] <twysamz> Day-to-Day Responsibilities
[20:15:22] <twysamz> Creating and supporting application deployment pipelines that are automated, reliable and can scale with a growing technology department
[20:15:22] <twysamz> Taking responsibility for production incidents, mitigating and resolving the underlying issue, and conducting post mortems to prevent the same issue from occurring again
[20:15:24] <twysamz> Configuring system and application monitoring, defining alerts and building reporting dashboards
[20:15:26] <twysamz> Using a deep understanding of cloud engineering and DevOps best practices to advise our Engineering teams on capacity planning, analysis, design, implementation and testing of the platform
[20:15:28] <twysamz> Provides technical mentorship and guidance to peers
[20:15:30] <twysamz> Build and maintain tools for deployment, monitoring and operations; troubleshoot and resolve issues in our dev, test and production environments
[20:15:32] <twysamz> Working with Director of IT to identify areas of improvement for successful completion of a project 
[20:15:34] <twysamz> Prepare level of effort estimates for project tasks
[20:15:36] <twysamz> Good judgement regarding when to power through difficult problems to get project completed

[20:19:30] <kwilczynski> "Prepare level of effort estimates for project tasks"
[20:19:42] <kwilczynski> Wouldn't this be done by whoever is paid to the manager and PM?
[20:20:09] <kwilczynski> Change the title to SRE, drop the dreaded "pipelines" in favour of "automated deployment".
[20:20:16] <kwilczynski> And it will be better.
[20:20:17] <kwilczynski> :)
[20:20:26] <twysamz> I'll pass that along lol
[20:20:32] <kwilczynski> There is also no security to speak of in the above.
[20:20:43] <twysamz> That's why they're working on the title change lol
[20:20:46] <kwilczynski> (and security alone can be a very wide spectrum)
[20:21:05] <twysamz> The current director is well aware that devsecops isn't really a title but it takes some time to get things moved around
[20:21:15] <kwilczynski> Really?
[20:21:25] <kwilczynski> How big is the company?
[20:21:29] <twysamz> 130~
[20:21:29] <kwilczynski> 10k+?
[20:21:33] <kwilczynski> 130 people?
[20:21:41] <kwilczynski> And they can't change a title on a whim?
[20:21:46] <kwilczynski> I sense deep issues there.
[20:21:55] <twysamz> Doubled in size last year but really great culture
[20:22:12] <twysamz> There are a lot of irons in the fire, it's not huge on the list 
[20:23:05] <kwilczynski> OK.
[20:23:17] <kwilczynski> I would change the title to at least drop "sec" form it.
[20:23:27] <kwilczynski> It'd be only fair to potential candidates.
[20:27:01] <twysamz> I don't think anyone would disagree with that
[20:28:29] <kwilczynski> These days...
[20:28:47] <kwilczynski> One is devsecswepmdevrelops really.
[20:28:48] <kwilczynski> :)
