[01:14:55] <melodie> I would like to ask for help with my text. Can someone tell me if it is ok or if it needs improvement? https://etherpad.linuxvillage.org/p/page-statique-bento
[01:15:24] <Prutz> spam
[01:15:30] <Prutz> ?
[01:15:42] <melodie> why spam? 
[01:15:58] <acdw> says i need a password to access the pad
[01:16:09] <TimMc> I can view it just fine.
[01:16:16] <melodie> this is a text which I am about to publish, so I being a French speaking person I am asking for help
[01:16:25] <Prutz> oh you entered the channel and posted the link :)
[01:16:40] <TimMc> Prutz: Not uncommon here.
[01:16:46] <melodie> I also said a few words prior, didn't I?
[01:17:06] <melodie> maybe if I put it on pastebin it is better?
[01:17:13] <melodie> I can do that if needed?
[01:17:29] <TimMc> melodie: "the computers resources" -- "computer's"
[01:17:44] <melodie> I don't get why the pad would request a password, a buddy from another chan came just before and he didn't meet with such annoyance?
[01:17:46] <TimMc> "some of them which have been" -- remove "them"
[01:17:53] <melodie> TimMc, good, thanks!

[01:22:10] <melodie> Prutz, yes, this is what a pad (Etherpad here) is meant for. Collaborative work.
[01:22:16] <Prutz> cool
[01:22:22] <melodie> :-)
[01:22:58] <TimMc> I've put a couple deletions back in, with strikeout, so that you can copy over the deletions as well.
[01:27:24] <TimMc> There are still a few areas where there might be some slightly stilted language, but I think this looks pretty good!

[01:28:02] <melodie> I just have to add the links now in the page, and then upload it to the server
[01:28:07] <Prutz> isnt it with ' the' ?
[01:28:11] <TimMc> Specifically, there are a number of places where you're using articles (a/an/the) in a way that I'm not sure is intended.

[01:28:51] <Prutz> Bento antiX has replaced several desktops f
[01:28:57] <Prutz> like this?
[01:29:01] <melodie> well, Prutz : antiX comes with a half dozen desktops. IceWM, Rox, Fluxbox, JWM... 
[01:29:24] <TimMc> I might actully change "the several desktops from" with s/from/of/
[01:29:24] <Prutz> ah ok I get it
[01:29:25] <Prutz> :)
[01:29:33] <melodie> I removed them all and replaced with my openbox window manager recipe. How would you explain that in few simple words?
[01:30:08] <bin> "I replaced the provided window managers with Openbox"
[01:31:45] <melodie> look line 19 ?
[01:32:10] <melodie> bin, antiX does not use just window managers but also some full environments
[01:32:16] <melodie> such as IceWM
[01:32:28] <bin> then you can say "window managers and desktop environments"
[01:32:41] <bin> im p.sure icewm is not a full de though
[01:32:45] <melodie> too many words (there are many already)
[01:32:58] <bin> yeah icewm is just a window manager
[01:33:03] <melodie> Prutz, what do you think?
[01:33:27] <Prutz> i'm not native English speaker but I'm editing in red ;)
[01:35:24] <melodie> I saw, and that gave me an idea which I wrote just below
[01:36:06] <melodie> some people talk and write real good English, even if not native.

[05:44:43] <samuely> is this correct ?

[05:47:09] *** tom_bombadil is now known as kurahaupo__
[05:47:11] <Me-me> Right. In that case, you use "hang", the present tense, as opposed to hung, the past tense.
[05:47:30] <samuely> I want to use it in the phone.
[05:47:38] *** Parts: acdw (~acdw@user/acdw) (See You, Space Cowpokes . . .)
[05:47:48] <Me-me> Indeed. The same answer applies.
[05:48:00] <samuely> Let me solve the problem myself. May I hang up now?
[05:48:06] <kurahaupo__> Me-me: technically the infinitive rather than the present tense, for when they differ
[05:48:07] <Me-me> That works, yes.
[05:48:17] <Me-me> kurahaupo: Point taken.
[05:48:45] <samuely> any alternatives in this case?
[05:49:04] <samuely> hang and hung sounds the same in the phone, right?
[05:49:13] <kurahaupo__> samuely: No
[05:49:20] <Me-me> I mean it depends on one's accent, but no, they are not the same.
[05:50:01] <samuely> "May I hang up now?" is it widely used?
[05:50:41] <kurahaupo__> samuely: Not common in my experience. The question is why do you want to hang up?
[05:50:41] <Me-me> I wouldn't say it's a common phrase. But that's a complicated social thing, as opposed to a well-established script.
[05:51:09] <samuely> kurahaupo__, the speaker said he has works to do.
[05:51:23] <Me-me> Indeed, usually (again, depending on cultural context) you would simply declare your need to hang up, either by leading into it with social cues, lying, or simply saying that you are about to hang up.
[05:51:46] <Me-me> "I have work to do, so I have to hang up now." Or something similar. Anything with which you would also break off a normal, in-person conversation.
[05:52:03] <kurahaupo__> "I'm sorry, I have to go now. Thanks for your call, please call again tomorrow. Bye."
[05:52:42] <Me-me> I want to stress again the parallels between it and an in-person conversation.
[05:52:44] *** Quits: blueparrot (~owl@5.62.229.151) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[05:54:14] <samuely> the speaker has already helped me with my operations, and he has other works to do. I am about to do the operations so I intend to hang up instead of letting him waiting there cause my browser is loading slowly.
[05:54:19] <kurahaupo__> "I need to go in a few minutes; do you have any important questions?
[05:55:01] <kurahaupo__> "Thanks for your help, I'll let you go now.
[05:55:31] <samuely> this one is proper here
[05:55:44] <samuely> just say, let you go
[05:55:59] <kurahaupo__> samuely: If you're acknowledging that they need to go, then focus on that
[05:56:15] <kurahaupo__> Me-me: ^^^
[05:56:55] <samuely> Let me solve the problem myself. You may go now.
[05:57:03] <samuely> sounds rude?
[05:57:25] <Me-me> I mean, it depends on your relationship with the person on the other end of the call. We can't give you better context than you have for yourself.
[05:57:42] <samuely> it's business context
[05:58:05] <kurahaupo__> samuely: "you may go" tends to imply that you normally have control of that person, like a parent or boss
[05:58:46] <twb> samuely: it's literally dismissive
[05:59:02] <samuely> I'll let you go now. < this has the same implication.
[05:59:05] <twb> Possibly rude; certainly brusque
[05:59:20] <twb> Vetinari says "do not let me detain you"
[05:59:46] <kurahaupo__> samuely: No, "Thanks for your time, I'll let you go now." is exactly what I would say
[06:00:29] <twb> WHich is à double entente with "if you stay, I will incarcerate you for wasting my time"

[07:24:24] <twb> I mean... it's sort of irrelevant now there's no separate earpiece to literally hang up
[07:24:46] <twb> It's more like "terminate the call"
[07:24:58] <kurahaupo> blueparrot: conventionally, when asking a question in English, the word order changes, so the verb comes before the subject (unless "who" or "what" or "which" stands in place of the subject). So « Is "hang your phone up" valid? Or must it be "hang up your phone"? »
[07:26:14] <kurahaupo> twb: I can still hang up a call by placing my phone face-down on a flat surface. And I prefer to use a high surface so the minor family members won't mess with it.

[07:30:03] <twb> I don't have one of those anymore
[07:30:33] <kurahaupo> "Hang up" has a long history of being used metaphorically as "leave stationary" or "surrender" or "retire". It's not just telephones.
[07:30:53] <twb> kurahaupo: what like a spear and shield?
[07:31:00] <twb> Isn't that because you hang them over the fire until the next war
[07:31:21] <kurahaupo> Yes, because you've finished fighting for today.
[07:31:39] <twb> kurahaupo: I think that's an unrelated sense

[07:32:10] <twb> "3. To keep delayed, suspended, held up, or stuck."
[07:32:37] <twb> I mean... you wouldn't say "I've hung up my four-wheel drive until the next wet season"
[07:32:47] <kurahaupo> To hang up one's {insert tool-of-trade} generally means to retire

[11:21:46] <Nobrem> hi
[11:22:01] <Nobrem> I just wanted to write something in a channel,  but then I wondered if that would even be correct
[11:22:17] <Nobrem> >> I already ran "snap remove anbox" and then re-installed it
[11:22:28] <Nobrem> I meant to add "to no avail"
[11:22:37] <Nobrem> but then I wondered, if "to no avail" at the end would even be correct
[11:22:44] <Nobrem> I meant to say:  "But it did not help"
[11:25:15] <el> sometimes it's easier to say what you meant to say in simple words
[11:25:43] <el> especially in channels where you could be talking to someone who barely knows English.
[11:26:55] <Nobrem> el, yeah, the person barely knowing English would be me in this case, whereas I suppose the rest of the channel are native speakers ;)
[11:27:22] <el> you might be surprised at how fluent you seem, then
[11:28:28] *** Joins: otisolsen70 (~otisolsen@xd4ed80b5.cust.hiper.dk)
[11:28:42] <Nobrem> el: well, I have been learning English for quite a while, however, there is _always_,  literally always something new I learn whenever I turn on netflix, youtube or whatever English speaking documentary 
[11:29:09] <Nobrem> it feels like I will never be able to achieve the same fluency as one does when growing up in an English speaking country
[11:31:38] <el> that may be the case, but i assure you that if you know the phrase "to no avail" you're well ahead of many people actively giving support in channels who are constantly using translation apps to do so. opting for the simple version of the phrase is helpful to them :)
[11:32:27] <el> and aside from that, your usage of the phrase seems correct to me!
[11:32:31] <Nobrem> so, long story short, "to no avail" would have been correct?
[11:32:36] <Nobrem> thank you, el!

[11:38:28] <Nobrem> one of the things in modern English that is interesting to me, is, how quickly grammar is changing
[11:38:38] <Nobrem> "she cute"   seems to be totally acceptable nowadays
[11:38:46] <Nobrem> or  "If I was him"
[11:39:07] <Nobrem> or,  "Teachers be like ..."
[11:40:06] <twb> Nobrem: "she cute" sounds like AAVE sociolect to me
[11:40:15] <twb> Nobrem: standard English would be "she's cute"
[11:40:21] <snappy> Yeah the only one that seems appropriate is "If I was him"
[11:40:44] <Nobrem> twb, yep, of course there was a conjugated form of the verb "to be" missing
[11:40:50] <Nobrem> twb, that is what trips me up here
[11:41:05] <Nobrem> and, one thing that also makes me wonder, is "aks"
[11:41:16] <Nobrem> there are so many people saying "He aksed me" rather than "He asked me"
[11:41:17] <twb> That's *definitely* AAVE
[11:41:32] <Nobrem> snappy, no, if I _were_ him
[11:41:39] <twb> "Tyrone, din't I aks you to take out the trash?"
[11:42:00] <snappy> Nobrem: sure, I guess context matters because the tense "if I was him" could still be correct
[11:42:16] <snappy> no wait
[11:42:19] <snappy> i guess you're right, it'd be were
[11:42:23] <twb> except in my example it would much more likely be "tell you to take out the trash"
[11:43:05] <wyre> when something is at rest ... could I also say "in a resting situation"? 
[11:43:25] <twb> I think "if I was him" is one of those mood or tense things that is not used enough for me to really go "that's wrong" or "that's right"
[11:43:39] <twb> It feels not quite right, but I can't say why
[11:43:52] <twb> So it is probably valid but in a rare mood

[11:57:13] <Nobrem> then my horseback riding teacher (who is _English_) taught me the wrong word when I was a kid
[11:57:29] <twb> probably a farrier can also make horseshoes
[11:57:38] <Nobrem> she always referred to the person coming to the stable as blacksmith

[11:58:23] <twb> I think in a developed society I would expect that job to be done by a vet

[13:06:04] <wyre> Nobrem, Me-me, farrier is pretty similar to 'herrero', which is the term in spanish 😊
[13:06:14] <Me-me> I see.
[13:06:33] <wyre> a lot of initial F from latin are converted to H in spanish
[13:07:12] <wyre> like in Formica (Hormiga -> ant)
[13:07:56] <wyre> Furnus (Horno -> oven)
[13:08:47] <wyre> Farina (Harina -> flour)
[13:09:26] <wyre> Facere (Hacer -> to do) 
[13:09:29] <wyre> ok, I stop 😆
[13:10:54] <twb> My mind was blown when I saw someone using chiamare / llamar in the sense of "call 112 if you are bitten by a dragon"
[13:11:12] <twb> Because that's like the first verb taught and they never mention using it that way
[13:13:17] <wyre> twb, you mean you saw some spanish person using chiamare instead llamar? 
[13:13:26] <twb> wyre: chiamare is italian equivalent
[13:13:32] <twb> same latin root
[13:14:03] <twb> I was reading an Australian government thing in Italian, but then I went and checked Spanish as well
[13:14:16] <wyre> oh, I see, but I dind't get your point about "they never mention using it that way" 🤔
[13:14:41] <twb> Normally they teach "me llamo 'Fred'" &c

[13:15:24] <wyre> that's a little bit confusing, I agree
[13:15:54] <wyre> because the actual translation is "my name is", english people doesn't use 'call' in that sense 😆
[13:16:36] <twb> literally "I call myself" and "how do you call yourself"
[13:16:43] <wyre> in fact ... you can use 'name' as verb
[13:17:14] <twb> "I call myself Fred" is valid English, just a little weird.
[13:17:31] <twb> I suppose "Soy Fred" is fine.
[13:17:31] <wyre> I'm wondering if "How should I name you?" is something rigth/accepted 🤔
[13:17:40] <Me-me> There are some who call me... Me-me.
[13:18:14] <twb> I occasionally see something like "Excuse please... how are you called?" when a fictional character is coming from a romance language
[13:18:28] <twb> It definitely sounds very odd
[13:18:44] <Me-me> Yes, it would seem as though English is an outlier in how we handle that syntax.
[13:18:55] <twb> well English is a germanic not a romance language
[13:19:02] <pussipupu> Some people call me the space cowboy
[13:19:03] <twb> We also do not have patronymic
[13:19:19] <Me-me> I don't think it's categorical like that.
[13:19:32] <Me-me> We take elements from romance, germanic, pretty much every other language.

[22:13:40] <mdogg> blkshp: You bring up a good point, though.  Amazon does know your location based upon how you login to their site.  It would look kind of suspicious if all of the sudden you're watching a video which is restricted to viewers in a completely different continent.

[22:17:23] <mdogg> I'm not sure if it's really the content providers who care so much as the people who produce the content.  I have a feeling that if it were up to the providers, Amazon and Netflix would just say, "Sure, you want to access U.K. content, pay an additional amount each month."

[23:19:07] <lwalaa> hey guys I have a question 
[23:19:59] *** Quits: mickey8 (~user@user/mickey) (Client Quit)
[23:20:10] *** Joins: mickey8 (~user@user/mickey)
[23:21:58] <lwalaa> I am filling DS-160 application for US visa, and I'm facing this question "Relationship with Person traveling with you" the choices are "Spouse, Parent, Child, Friend, Other" what should I choose from those options if the person is my 32 years old son? Child?
[23:22:21] <blkshp> Yes
[23:22:49] <lwalaa> Thanks, thought child is used only for kids
[23:23:25] <blkshp> No, an adult can still be someone's child.
[23:23:34] <GuiToris> :/
[23:23:56] <TimMc> In normal speech you might refer to him as your "son", "adult son", or even the apparently oxymoronic "adult child".
[23:24:01] *** Quits: ntz (~dpecka@static-84-42-228-122.net.upcbroadband.cz) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[23:24:12] <GuiToris> I disagree with blkshp, but who am I to do so?!
[23:24:14] <TimMc> but in paperwork you would just say "child"
[23:24:16] <GuiToris> !d child
[23:24:18] <tinsoldier> child — Noun: 1. A person who has not yet reached adulthood, whether natural (puberty), cultural (initiation), or legal (majority)., 2. (with possessive) One's direct descendant by birth, regardless of age; offspring; a son or daughter., 3. (cartomancy) The thirteenth Lenormand card., 4. (figuratively) A figurative offspring, particularly:, — Verb: 1 <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/child>...
[23:24:25] <GuiToris>  A person who has not yet reached adulthood
[23:24:33] <TimMc> He's not *a* child, but he's *your* child. :-)
[23:24:34] <blkshp> 2.
[23:24:43] <blkshp> Precisely, what TimMc said.

[23:25:15] <GuiToris> ehh, it's odd, in any way

[23:25:43] <blkshp> It would but it's the Americans.

[23:26:18] <blkshp> hehe
[23:26:25] <GuiToris> blkshp, where German almost became the official language
[23:26:43] <blkshp> Nah, you never got that far :P
[23:27:06] <GuiToris> they said only a few percents were missing

[23:27:13] <blkshp> percent*
[23:27:15] <blkshp> was*
[23:27:51] <lwalaa> Thanks guys
[23:27:52] <GuiToris> if you were true Brit (don't kick me for this :P :D) you would have suggested 'per cent'
[23:28:23] <blkshp> Well I was thinking it makes more sense.
[23:28:24] <GuiToris> (don't ban me either, I know your little tricks!)
[23:28:41] <TimMc> lwalaa: Specifically, "child" as a relationship term can mean someone of any age, but if it's used as a noun in general ("a child", "unaccompanied children") it does mean a kid, someone young.
[23:28:46] <LimeOn> Is Australia, New Zealand English language more simmilar to American one or to the British one?
[23:29:03] <lwalaa> I see
[23:29:03] <TimMc> (but it always feels awkward to refer to an adult child)
[23:29:20] <TimMc> And yes, it does cause confusion sometimes. :-)
[23:29:28] <GuiToris> LimeOn, it's still in the commonwealth
[23:30:10] <LimeOn> That means more closer to british one,right?
[23:31:02] <blkshp> more close or closer, you can't say "more closer"
[23:31:25] <LimeOn> Oh, more close
[23:31:50] <GuiToris> I haven't measure the distance yet! :O
[23:31:54] <GuiToris> +d
[23:32:01] <blueparrot> Do these sentences have same meaning? 'She hasn't been going to university for 2 years' and 'She hasn't gone to university for 2 years'?
[23:32:03] <GuiToris> blkshp, stole it, as usual
[23:33:02] <TimMc> blueparrot: Not quite.
[23:33:27] <TimMc> although the meaning is a little ambiguous.
[23:33:31] <blkshp> XD
[23:33:51] <GuiToris> blkshp, 'The real events underlying the German-but-by-a-single-vote story date to 1794'
[23:33:54] <GuiToris> quote unquote
[23:34:16] <GuiToris> and Germany would be the center of the world then
[23:34:24] <GuiToris> everybody wants to learn german
[23:34:26] <blkshp> well we were first!
[23:34:34] <LimeOn> Not me GuiToris
[23:34:38] <LimeOn> HAHA
[23:35:19] <GuiToris> and you (blkshp) would come here to ask your stupid, lame German questions, and I would correct you.... what a parallel universe would it be!
[23:36:22] <GuiToris> <fakeblkshp>, is it 'du bist' or 'du arest' ?!
[23:36:35] <LimeOn> :o
[23:36:49] <GuiToris> I have tears in my eyes, it would be so beautiful.
[23:36:56] <blkshp> But it didn't happen and English is one of the most popular und deutsch ist ein gigglefest.
