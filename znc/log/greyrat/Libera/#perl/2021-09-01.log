[01:03:21] <hudo> I have a 3 column list with articlenr, successor, history. At hte beginning the history contains the articlenr and if a successor is known ,it is also written in the history column.
[01:03:22] <hudo> At the end, the history-field of each article should contain the whole articlenrs connected to this article in ascending order. Typically a successor has a "greater" articlenr then the predecessor.

[01:32:20] <Grinnz> chmod g+ws on the dir before installing to it so the whole thing stays group writable, as well

[02:50:44] <Grinnz> which part?
[02:50:55] <leitz> Why not use perl blead.
[02:50:59] *** Quits: eramirez (~eramirez@49.149.131.61) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[02:51:01] <LeoNerd> The only reason to build blead is if you're developing perl -itself-
[02:51:03] <Grinnz> it's a development track, it's not intended for users
[02:51:09] <Grinnz> it will commonly have random bugs
[02:51:21] *** Quits: Kharec (~Kharec@lfbn-lyo-1-2099-53.w90-66.abo.wanadoo.fr) (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
[02:51:42] <Grinnz> you want to stick to debugging your code, not perl itself :P
[02:52:46] *** Joins: eramirez (~eramirez@49.149.131.61)
[02:52:46] <leitz> Wow, corelist has more than 600 modules listed. Cool...
[02:53:02] <Grinnz> it has some options
[02:54:58] *** Quits: krismatrix (~krismatri@38.80.149.51) (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
[02:56:15] <ether> the monthly point releases are still close to "bleading edge", and they are much more reliable than random commits in the middle of the development cycle
[02:56:47] <ether> plus you can use plenv or perlbrew to install them
[02:56:54] <Grinnz> still unsupported, but if you really like reporting bugs to #p5p go for it
[02:56:55] <leitz> err....

[02:57:12] *** Quits: eramirez (~eramirez@49.149.131.61) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[02:57:32] <Grinnz> but seriously. the current version of perl for users is 5.34.0
[02:57:34] <ether> the more people running the point releases, the sooner we find bugs
[02:57:42] <ether> but yeah I'd never use a point release for anything in production
[02:58:05] <leitz> Many of us don't use a x.x.0 in production.
[02:58:06] *** Quits: zacts (~zacts@user/zacts) (Quit: Client closed)
[02:58:15] <leitz> Historicly bad.
[02:58:24] <Grinnz> not since 5.10.0
[02:58:32] <Grinnz> but ether is talking about dev releases, not maint releases
[02:58:46] *** Joins: eramirez (~eramirez@49.149.131.61)
[02:59:13] <ether> the latest monthly release is 5.35.3; 5.36.0 will be next spring. 5.34.1 is not scheduled but may happen in a few months if there's something important that should go out
[02:59:41] <leitz> Understood. Mostly. I don't disagree with you, but I'm poking a related beast at the moment.
[02:59:41] <ether> there is no reason not to trust 5.34.0
[02:59:55] <Grinnz> stable releases are the ones with an even number in the middle - those are the ones you should use in production, and in dev unless you like being a guinea pig
[03:00:32] <Grinnz> which is fine, you just gotta know what you're in for
[03:01:08] <leitz> Understood. I'll probably go off blead once I figure out the next task.
