[03:05:22] <auctus> i fear the future of game streaming.
[03:05:26] <ThePendulum> it might be that in 2005, say, 10% of online users were using the pirate bay, and now it's only 1%, but there are also 10x as many people online

[03:06:28] <ThePendulum> I guess that's already a thing with the compulsory always-online

[03:06:35] <auctus> if we really want to
[03:06:40] <auctus> but not with streamed gamaes
[03:07:00] <ThePendulum> the game has to support that though, or someone has to be able to rewrite what it points to
[03:07:06] <auctus> i tried to order a keyboard last night but got outbid and now im stuck with this one that doubles keys and makes me type "gamae" instead of "game"
[03:07:24] <scara> ThePendulum: I'm sure there is some weird patch online to run your own server.

[05:09:06] <KevinCarbonara> over the past few years it feels like every business has just gone to shit
[05:09:16] <KevinCarbonara> like every company is just awful in every way
[05:09:28] <KevinCarbonara> there is no one I can rely on to provide decent service or decent goods at all

[05:09:42] <KevinCarbonara> fast food companies mess up my order over 50% of the time. I do not get weird custom orders
[05:10:01] <KevinCarbonara> a good portion of the items amazon sends me are damaged or obvious fakes

[05:10:47] <skye0> neoliberalism!
[05:11:19] <skye0> and the way people have tried to solve it recently is just by cryptocurrency
[05:11:20] <skye0> as of recent
[05:11:24] <KevinCarbonara> what
[05:11:54] <KevinCarbonara> I guess if I just get scammed right from the get-go there's no reasonable expectation to receive goods or services in the first place

[05:14:56] <Selavi> jesus. I've played 96 hours of Witcher 3 since getting it 11 days ago
[05:15:27] <unfinity> ・゜゜・ ​ 。。・゜゜\_0<​ QUACK​!
[05:15:36] <joepie91> ,bef
[05:15:36] <unfinity> joepie91 you befriended a duck in 9.824 seconds! You have made friends with 224 ducks in #datahoarder.
[05:15:38] <Selavi> ,bang
[05:15:38] <unfinity> There is no duck! What are you shooting at?
[05:16:42] <Selavi> ,ducks
[05:16:42] <unfinity> Selavi has killed 62 ducks and befriended 420 ducks in #datahoarder.
[05:17:59] <joepie91> Selavi: you lost to a Matrix bridge :p
[05:18:51] <Selavi> meh, I'll get those last 7 ducks eventually
[05:19:22] <Selavi> also was checking out /r/place. sprawling flags is the cringiest shit to me
[05:25:03] <KevinCarbonara> there was a big ukraine flag for a bit, that was cool
[05:25:12] <KevinCarbonara> but then they kept trying to cover it up with a trans flag
[05:28:02] <ThePendulum> that's... lame
[05:28:51] <joepie91> fuck national flags
[05:28:52] <Selavi> UA is still pretty big. at least they put shit on it. NL, ES, etc are pretty good about putting cultural stuff there too. USA, CA. and DK are fucking embarrassing
[05:28:57] <joepie91> nationalism sucks
[05:30:05] <KevinCarbonara> not all patriotism is nationalism
[05:30:25] <KevinCarbonara> Why are USA and CA embarrassing?
[05:30:42] <skye0> canada? well i get they speak french only in quebec but idk how bad it is there
[05:30:50] <skye0> Selavi amogus with dick was the best for me
[05:31:28] <Selavi> basic ass flags. USA can't even do the stars remotely right. quite the dearth of creativity of any sort
[05:31:41] <skye0> KevinCarbonara I partly blame a lot of Americans who are more concerned about the fact that their politicians care more about Ukraine but a state has put a law forward against trans kids
[05:31:49] <skye0> American culture tends to be inward looking
[05:32:01] <skye0> i.e. the thing going on in Texas
[05:32:04] <KevinCarbonara> I thought we were still talking about reddit/place
[05:32:12] <skye0> yeah, kinda
[05:32:26] <KevinCarbonara> Texas does not represent America, the reason they're getting so much attention is because they're going against the grain, not with it
[05:33:22] <KevinCarbonara> there's an Italian section here, with an Italian flag and pixel art of a piece of pizza
[05:33:27] <skye0> what texas and florida have been doing as of recent has been so far against the grain that inaction would spell disaster in their eyes
[05:33:39] <skye0> i've mostly just been interested to see where the /r/esperanto thing is
[05:33:43] <KevinCarbonara> I've always wondered how Italians felt about their strong association with their food in media representation
[05:33:47] <Selavi> lol yeah the pizza on the Creation of Adam got a chuckle out of me

[22:15:01] <omnigoat> anyone aware if there was some way to have unRAID like parity on any old *nix?
[22:15:34] *** rvalue- is now known as rvalue
[22:19:53] <evilgohan2> Not personally, but I'm sure it's possible.
[22:21:33] <omnigoat> hmm, i should rephrase that :D some way as in ready made with at least a modest user base

[23:32:06] <ThePendulum> bit skeptical it will
[23:37:07] <ThePendulum> not a WD80EMAZ :C
[23:41:16] <ThePendulum> no smart #22 attribute that indicates a helium drive, although that might be because it's in its enclosure

[23:53:22] <ThePendulum> it's a WD80EMZZ, can't find much about it, doesn't seem to be as nice as the EMAZ I'm using throughout the rest of the system
[23:53:38] *** Joins: LuKaRo (~LuKaRo@p4fc32a2c.dip0.t-ipconnect.de)
[23:58:54] <NeoThermic> EMZZ is new to me, my reds have been either EZAZ (shucked white labels) or EFZX (actual red label reds)
