[06:05:08] <wauterboi> Elw3 it is indeed weird. And the only one that I've seen that is mature is Moonscript - maybe Fennel too.
[06:06:56] <wauterboi> with that said, I like the idea of having a preprocessor state
[06:07:55] <Elw3> I cant even imagine where to use that for. But i guess everyone codes different...
[06:08:58] <wauterboi> Macro unrolling, constants, etc
[06:09:08] <wauterboi> *compile-time constants
[06:10:10] <Elw3> Compile time constants for a scripting language...
[06:11:01] <furq> yes what about it
[06:11:32] <wauterboi> also, static type checking
[06:12:29] <wauterboi> Elw3 compile-time constants are immutable and reduce the chances of mistakes. They're simple mistakes, but additional safety is always nice.
[06:13:26] <Elw3> This doest feel like the right language for this.
[06:13:38] <wauterboi> Why not?
[06:14:12] <Elw3> Its my feeling, youd have to kiss me before ill talk about my feelings with you.
[06:14:52] <wauterboi> Luajit is still impressive for its speed, and using it as a target seems neat imo
[06:15:17] <Elw3> Aaaaanyway back to code
[06:16:53] <wauterboi> Also, when you consider how many applications embed Lua and how many big projects are dependent on it, having access to additional features through macros without any performance cost is interesting. Reaper, for example, has scripts with entire graphical interfaces built out of Lua
[06:17:04] <wauterboi> *community-submitted scripts

[06:24:33] *** Joins: rgrinberg (~textual@177.248.156.216)
[06:29:50] <Elw3> Hm either do a gmatch for all spaces and create a table for the positions or ill use string.reverse, but is creating a string better than creating a table?
[06:30:11] <J_Darnley> Elw3: can string.find work in reverse?
[06:30:34] <Elw3> Thats what i would like to know myself
[06:30:47] <Elw3> THAT would be ideal.
[06:31:12] <J_Darnley> "A third, optional numeric argument init specifies where to start the search; its default value is 1 and can be negative."
[06:31:37] <Elw3> No that just sets the start point counting from the back end.
[06:31:50] <Elw3> So -1 is the last letter.
[06:31:56] <J_Darnley> probably
[06:32:01] <J_Darnley> it doesn't actually say
[06:32:30] <technomancy> I didn't realize moonscript hasn't had a release in 5y
[06:32:38] <technomancy> I guess leafo is super busy with itch since it's really taken off
[06:32:46] <J_Darnley> but it still goes forwards even with negative?  oh well
[06:33:06] <J_Darnley> I have no more good ideas
[06:34:51] <Elw3> That would be a cool feature actually, reverse find.
[06:34:59] <Elw3> Does any language have that?
[06:36:01] <wauterboi> Is there a Luarock that offers a function to let you cross over into C to shuffle around the characters and return a new string?
[06:36:33] <Elw3> What?

[06:40:05] <wauterboi> I'm not saying this Luarock in particular does it, but I was sure I've seen Luarocks do what I've suggested
[06:40:21] <nmz> wauterboi: just... convert to a table and do whatever you want with the character array
[06:41:32] <Elw3> I am not sure if that was meant to be an answer for my question above...
[06:43:16] <wauterboi> That would indeed be my approach: find someone else who has done the work with performance in mind
[06:44:08] <Elw3> Thats rather horrible for a trivial problem.
[06:44:25] <wauterboi> Why?
[06:45:16] <Elw3> Youll end up adding a lot of depends that way.
[06:45:56] <Elw3> Unless a problem needs hunderts of lines to solve i would not try to look somewhere else.
[06:49:39] <wauterboi> You can also look at how others implement their solutions by visiting these repositories and studying their code
