[00:05:20] <dbohdan> Okay, I was very wrong, and of course he is Jesus
[00:06:03] <gwern> well. I'm not 100% sure of that. simply because of the point about using humans as means. it goes *so* strongly against contemporary christianity
[00:06:21] <gwern> but redditors are claiming 0hpl is really an atheist so maybe he's not as big on that
[00:06:59] <gwern> (ie he could be a false messiah, a techno-anti-christ of some sort, imitating jesus)
[00:07:22] <dbohdan> He is a crypto-Christian atheist.  He said his father and grandfather are preachers.
[00:08:08] <gwern> confusing
[00:08:09] <dbohdan> So I think your interpretation is correct.  Maybe it's an Antichrist thing, but it's definitely not a "non-Christ" thing.
[00:08:12] <ggreer> amazon really seems to be doing a good job of finding... ugh... synergies between their various business units. for example: they have a show called Making the Cut, where fashion designers from around the world compete to create new clothing. the winner at the end of the season gets $1M and a huge partnership with amazon. the judges and hosts are supermodels and ridiculously wealthy fashion designers
[00:08:18] <ggreer> the production values are insane. the sets are stupidly expensive (in one episode, they set up an entire carnival including a carousel and ferris wheel around the runway). and each episode, the winner's clothing gets featured in amazon's Making the Cut store and is available immediately

[02:33:38] <quanticle> Why?
[02:33:58] <kuudes> I mean, is it wrong they enforce the quarantines?
[02:34:15] <quanticle> It depends: do you believe in people having inalienable rights?
[02:34:21] <kuudes> that is that door knocking thing, they check if persons who have been ordered to stay at home are at home
[02:34:29] <kuudes> well I guess they could arrest them
[02:34:36] <kuudes> but that would be more inconvenient
[02:34:38] <ggreer> *everyone* has been ordered to stay at home
[02:35:15] <Betawolf> I mean, you're also not meant to have various things in your house ever, like illegal drugs. By the same logic, it would be fine for the police to come search everyone's house periodically for drugs?
[02:35:17] <kuudes> quanticle, it has been in discussion over here, so far the constitutional committee has decided that the situation has not warranted such
[02:35:18] <quanticle> Freedom of movement? Privacy? Nah, we only believe in inalienable rights as long as there isn't a good excuse for us to take them away.
[02:36:03] <kuudes> Betawolf, depends on what level of logic you are talking about
[02:36:18] <kuudes> on the situation, no, because such has not been made into a law
[02:36:44] <kuudes> then the question on if such should be made into a law, depends on the hypotheticals
[02:37:05] <kuudes> quanticle, well, usa puts children into cages, or how was it
[02:37:15] <kuudes> inalienable rights etc
[02:37:46] <quanticle> So if the government made a law allowing the police to randomly enter your house and search it for contraband (whether that be people evading COVID quarantines, illegal drugs, or heck, downloaded music that violates copyright restrictions), that would be okay?
[02:37:53] <kuudes> right to stay alive is pretty important, but yes there are also other rights. in the end it is balancing things
[02:38:06] <ggreer> rights apply to law-abiding citizens. if I tried to sneak into canada I'd get put in a cage
[02:38:20] <kuudes> the government can't make such a law currently, because no such reason that would justify it, exists
[02:38:36] <kuudes> as said, it depends on the hypothetical
[02:38:43] <quanticle> Well, sure, people can die of drug overdoses too... so the question still stands.
[02:38:51] <kuudes> in state of war I would support the government to check for dissidents etc
[02:39:17] <kuudes> ie as the war here is on the terms "the winners will put us to death camps if we lose"
[02:39:59] <kuudes> usa also has death penalty, whereas in europe life is inalienable right to also felons
[02:40:07] <feep> germany does not believe in inalienable rights except "dignity of man" which is completely undefined

[02:41:30] <kuudes> over here the health authority got nearly sued for making recommendation the parliamentary ombudsman found to be based on no law.
[02:41:46] <feep> not because there's anything wrong with inalienable rights per se but because any functioning government tramples over these rights on the regular

[02:42:44] <Betawolf> I believe it's in general bad when the government sends armed men to surveil the population. Maybe if this were a zombie plague or people were making Soviet Russia in their basements or something this would be an appropriate reaction.
[02:42:47] <feep> the german approach is more "these rights are pretty fucking important so if you violate them you better do it for the sake of another right"

[02:45:10] <feep> idk, obormot was doing a thing and I joined in
[02:45:11] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: but the supe would never allow a sex dungeon or sub-USSR
[02:45:31] <two2thehead> feep, Betawolf ah
[02:45:37] <feep> "why don't you put the whole world in your sex dungeon basement, superman"
[02:45:50] <kuudes> quanticle, was that against inalienable rights?
[02:46:18] <kuudes> it was one of the things that saved us from swedish style of 7000 deaths to our current <1000 deaths
[02:46:37] <feep> that sounds like a martial arts technique from a chinese movie
[02:46:38] <kuudes> but yes, freedom of movement is a big right
[02:46:41] <feep> Swedish Style of 7000 Deaths!
[02:46:45] <kuudes> :D
[02:47:07] <feep> Your <1000 deaths cannot compare!
[02:47:23] <two2thehead> lol
[02:47:25] <kuudes> iirc some lawyers criticized it on that it made some people worse as they could not flee to the other side, regardless which side was better off
[02:47:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Well... my friend owns a house... maybe... maybe I could ask him to let me make Soviet Russia in his basement :\
[02:47:34] <quanticle> I'm not sure, but I would prefer to live in Sweden rather than Finland
[02:48:03] <kuudes> ok
[02:48:08] <quanticle> Wait, it's possible to make Soviet Russia in basements!
[02:48:15] <Betawolf> There might be problems that result from making Soviet Russia, it's hard to tell given the media's silence on the topic.
[02:48:16] <kuudes> :D
[02:48:17] <quanticle> Dammit! I fucked up; my townhouse doesn't have one!
[02:51:30] <kuudes> mind you that this is a thing government can't do normally. it requires specific acknowledgement by prime minister and president that finland is in exceptional circumstances, and then approval of the parliament that the statutes are reasonable and minimal within the circumstances, and are in general within human rights as whole
[02:52:29] <kuudes> and indeed it was using the laws that were made for this type and other types of crisis situations already in the past when there was no such crisis, so it was not drafting random new emergency laws
[02:53:04] <kuudes> which also set limits on what can be made into statute of what types of crisis
[02:53:52] <kuudes> this was deemed a crisis of type 3 and 5, threat to national economy as whole and threat to life or welfare of large amounts of people by natural catastrophe or contagious disease or comparable threat
[02:54:17] <kuudes> 1 is war of existence, 2 is sort of semimilitary preparedness and 4 I don't remember
[02:54:28] <Betawolf> I've lost what you're arguing. Are you against what Australia's apparently doing, or bragging that it wouldn't happen in Finland, or saying your opinion of what's going on in Australia depends on what Australian law is with regard to this?
[02:54:58] <kuudes> I am pointing out that it does not feel that out of order to me, given the circumstances there
[02:55:12] <kuudes> but of course if the government there is lying or something, then things could be bad
[02:55:36] <kuudes> but on face value it seems to me that if they don't have vaccines, it would seem nice if they try to stop the spread of the lethal disease
[02:55:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> Goddamnit. My hairstylist got covid -_-
[02:56:25] <quanticle> You have a hairstylist? Like... a specific one?
[02:56:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes
[02:56:33] <kuudes> why wouldn't he
[02:56:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> She's been cutting my hair for many years now
[02:56:42] <quanticle> What incredible imperialist-capitalist decadence
[02:56:49] <kuudes> its nyc
[02:56:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't want to have to find a new one...
[02:56:59] <kuudes> do you think he has time to go to try random hairstylists
[02:57:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> Exactly
[02:57:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ain't nobody got time for that
[02:57:28] <filipepe> I had the impression Obormot was bald. It must be someone else
[02:58:20] <quanticle> Comrade, I go into the local Great Clips barbershop, sit down, ask for People's Haircut #17 (#4 on the sides and back, 4cm on the top with scissors) and I am satisfied
[02:58:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> I am def. not bald
[02:58:27] <kuudes> but yes, I can understand that in many places governments can be corrupt or inept etc and then it is bad to use police re random civilian matters
[02:58:56] <kuudes> didn't prk have those numbered hair styles
[02:59:00] <gwern> filipepe: logos01 prb
[02:59:01] <quanticle> I cannot believe that you'd aspire to such degeneracy as having a specific hairstylist whom you see to the exclusion of all others
[02:59:10] <feep> I always wanted long hair
[02:59:25] <feep> but I was a very socially conforming child and so never had it
[02:59:32] <filipepe> I'm letting my hair grow for the first time in my life right now
[02:59:33] <kuudes> can't you do that now?
[02:59:36] <feep> luckily, covid provides the perfect excuse for not going to the hairdresser
[02:59:39] <two2thehead> feep, monkeyspaw, your armpits will grow luscious locks from now on
[02:59:42] <quanticle> kuudes: What you don't seem to understand is that using police excessively is *how* governments become corrupt and inept
[02:59:45] <feep> however, it becomes problematic in the front
[02:59:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: I don't know what this "Great Clips" business is, but I go to my local hair salon down the block, which is privately owned and rents out chairs to individual stylists, and I go to a specific stylist, and I do not ask for anything because she knows exactly how I get my hair cut
[03:00:15] <feep> the solution: :raises big metal kitchen scissors:
[03:00:18] <kuudes> quanticle, maybe. but what do you think aus gov gains from having police going to check if people are at their homes?
[03:00:51] <feep> kuudes: so yes! I *can* do that now! in fact, I could always do that, it just took a while to develop the autonomy
[03:00:59] <kuudes> nice, good for you!
[03:01:02] <feep> n.n
[03:01:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: I wouldn't really mind the aesthetics of having long hair, but NYC weather being what it is, as soon as I go an extra week or two without getting a haircut, the added insulation causes my brain to start cooking inside my skull
[03:01:30] <quanticle> kuudes: Nothing in the short run, but if it keeps up, well, the more state interactions you have and the more rules you're enforcing the greater the opportunities for and returns to corruption. That article I posted earlier about the license Raj in India is relevant.
[03:01:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's just not tenable at all
[03:01:53] <quanticle> I don't like long hair. It gets itchy
[03:02:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> Itchy, hot, it's just terrible all around
[03:02:04] * gwern groans as he finally spots the infinite loop bug bedeviling him for the past 20 minutes. great... now I can work on the actual bugs
[03:02:11] <kuudes> quanticle, ok, sure. but within those weeks or months it is up?
[03:02:17] <[itchyjunk]> :O you say itchy like it's a bad thing.
[03:02:25] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: that is understandable, however it doesn't seem to be an issue for me
[03:02:32] <feep> approximately the only part of me that sweats is my back
[03:02:38] <feep> otoh, that makes up for the rest
[03:02:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: That is lucky!
[03:02:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> At least, in the hair department
[03:02:49] <quanticle> [itchyjunk]: You know, I never understood why you'd advertise *that* with your username.
[03:02:51] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: WATER POOLING IN MY ASS is not lucky.
[03:02:51] <kuudes> there is that haircutting style of making hair thinner
[03:02:55] <quanticle> Like... did anyone ever ask?
[03:02:57] <feep> but yes.

[03:03:14] <[itchyjunk]> quanticle, they don't have to. Saves time!
[03:03:32] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: the problem is for some reason I seem adapted to weather about ~10°C cooler than local temperatures
[03:03:40] <feep> meaning I sweat my ass off on mild summer days
[03:04:07] <feep> convenient in the winter tho
[03:04:08] <kuudes> have you considered moving to more north?
[03:04:12] <feep> yes
[03:04:17] <feep> unfortunately, my job is here
[03:04:20] <kuudes> indeed
[03:04:43] <feep> I have heard nonzero good things about estonia, and I am definitely considering my options
[03:04:44] <kuudes> I guess northeast germany is not very in-demand
[03:04:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> Heh, one of the things my grandfather told me about his time in the military was ... you find out pretty quickly, in training, that *what parts of your body sweat more* is (a) something that differs a lot from person to person, and (b) dramatically affects your quality of life when you have to march or w/e for hours a day
[03:04:55] <feep> oyeah
[03:05:00] <kuudes> denmark might be good as well
[03:05:13] <kuudes> at least per satw they like germans there as well
[03:05:26] <feep> kuudes: I like some of what I've seen of the governmental competence in estonia
[03:05:32] <kuudes> thats true
[03:05:33] <[itchyjunk]> You're only considering your options on planet?
[03:05:38] <gwern> didn't they just leak all of the photos in their databases?
[03:05:39] <feep> it'd be nice to have a government that knows what a laptop is for once
[03:05:46] <[itchyjunk]> Maybe remote jobs will require you to go off planet some day
[03:05:51] <feep> gwern: how do I put it
[03:06:03] <feep> germany is probably immune to this because we keep our photos in a filing cabinet.
[03:06:39] <momus> gwern: why have you made your twitter priv?
[03:06:40] <feep> it was especially painful in covid 
[03:06:43] <kuudes> quanticle, yeah, I presume our key prior difference comes from the past experiences. here it is relatively corruption free but yes it is not that way in most places
[03:07:06] <feep> we had a good technologically well-designed tracker app, and this so scared the government that they ordered no further work on it for an entire year until a random shitty commercial app showed them up
[03:07:08] <gwern> momus: the dark forest is nicer if you hide your light under a bushel
[03:07:09] <kuudes> otoh if reducing government power is the only option for less corruption, that sort of feels like a not good tradeoff

However, he 1) can't bring himself to believe its supernatural claims; 2) agrees with Moldbug that it naturally leads to progressivism; 3) generally seems to consider God too soft compared to Gnon.

[11:03:37] <rsaarelm> I've seen a lot of the "christianity leads to progressivism" stuff recently, not just in Moldbug, fwiw.

[11:04:26] <dbohdan> rsaarelm: It isn't a new idea at all, but the recent revival is probably due to Moldbug
[11:05:08] <nshepperd2> is that the 'christianity invented individual conscience' thing

[11:20:23] <dbohdan> FWIW, I have internalized this stuff, and, after the initial period of shock and grief, I don't think it's been making my life worse.  Then again, I don't live where it really hurts your reputation, and my life sucks for other reasons anyway.

The tribal shit is bullshit and everyone agrees that water is wet and rocks fall down, so you either coordinate on bullshit or have nothing very substantial to coordinate around.
[11:31:34] <rsaarelm> And now the one weird trick with science is that it can converge on the same claims no matter who is doing it, so suddenly you got this weird decentralized tribe that doesn't really have any historical precedent.
[11:33:15] <rsaarelm> And how NRX fits in the picture is that it's a spanner in the whig history narrative of science and philosophy and the modern progressive political value system being fundamentally in alignment.

[11:41:13] <dbohdan> PapuaHardyNet: What's your AGI horizon?  And do you mean globally?
[11:41:15] <PapuaHardyNet> but since societal collapse affects different people disproportionately, it is still possible for AGI to happen *while* society continues to collapse. Will AGI be our savior? idk

[11:43:06] <PapuaHardyNet> dbohdan, societal collapse globally, yes. by collapse I mean it is not possible for any government to be able to ensure basic services to all its citizens (such as enough food, water, shelter, etc.) at a sensible price

[11:47:20] <nshepperd2> 2100? that's awfully pessimistic
[11:47:34] <nshepperd2> flops have increased by like 1000x only in the last 20 years

[11:48:46] <PapuaHardyNet> GT 210, to be specific
[11:48:48] <nshepperd2> is AGI going to be developed on 12 year old nvidia graphics cards?
[11:49:54] <PapuaHardyNet> you have to admit, as long as it is hard for people to get their hands on hardware to experiment with DL, it we have a bottleneck for people pushing forward the space
[11:50:20] <nshepperd2> rtc gives out tpus for free
[11:50:22] <PapuaHardyNet> let me guess, you think the first self-improving AGI will be developed by Google or Facebook or some other behemoth

[11:51:36] <PapuaHardyNet> hmm. I think you and I are making very different assumptions here
[11:52:12] <PapuaHardyNet> we need an exponential increase in the computation power for DL models, and it needs to be affordable so we have as many minds working on this as possible.
[11:52:57] <PapuaHardyNet> one problem is that I'm not seeing an exponential increase in performance every generation of hardware, when you correct for the price of the hardware set by NVIDIA / AMD
[11:53:21] <nshepperd2> AGI will be developed by whoever has compute, such as the millions of people with 3090s

[11:54:18] <PapuaHardyNet> second, cryptocurrency mining is a big obstacle in this plan, since even if hardware is affordable, due to the infinite demand by miners, prices will always be pegged to profits generated by GPUs
[11:54:33] <PapuaHardyNet> making AI hardware always costly
[11:54:53] <nshepperd2> that's not really a problem
[11:56:35] <PapuaHardyNet> sure, if you accept a universe where Google or Facebook or Microsoft (using OpenAI) control the first self-improving AGI
[11:57:03] <saturn2> i think the vast majority of impressive results have been coming from the behemoths

[12:16:01] <PapuaHardyNet> cryptomining profitability is based on the expenses of the hardware and the electricity consumed
[12:16:51] <PapuaHardyNet> every ethereum miner generally has the same access to hardware, so $/flop is a meaningless metric when everyone has access to the same amount of flops
[12:17:33] <adiabatic> they don't have equal access to electricity prices, though, although I don't know if that means anything
[12:18:24] <PapuaHardyNet> no, that doesn't mean much, since miners always mine while finding the lowest electricity prices possible, or they move
[12:18:41] <nshepperd2> $/flop is what matters when you're deciding whether you mine crypto of train AIs
[12:18:53] <nshepperd2> whether to mine crypto or train AIs
[12:19:07] <PapuaHardyNet> miners cannot switch to training AIs. miners can and will only look at profits
[12:19:19] <nshepperd2> that's fine, other people can train AIs
[12:19:29] <PapuaHardyNet> unless you are talking about them renting out their hardware for other people a la vast.ai
[12:20:32] <PapuaHardyNet> but for that you are assuming that DL researchers pay more than mining profits for access to GPUs, and that doesn't make sense to me
[12:25:00] <nshepperd2> basically, the idea that crypto miners have infinite demand is propaganda
[12:25:22] <nshepperd2> the demand is limited by the actual profitability of crypto mining
[12:25:32] <nshepperd2> which is not necessarily a large number
[12:31:44] <PapuaHardyNet> okay, can you tell me how do you calculate the profitability of crypto mining? I have spent a lot of time in this space and I believe you have some broken assumptions and I'd like to figure them out
[12:32:34] <nshepperd2> you're ignoring the fact that hardware performance actually goes up
[12:33:23] <PapuaHardyNet> so every miner is on a countdown until the next generation releases, yes. If they can pay off their expenses for buying the card within the timespan, they only profit
[12:33:28] <nshepperd2> like, in terms of actual flops
[12:34:05] <nshepperd2> hardware performance increases don't make crypto mining more profitable, because the difficulty just increases
[12:34:07] <PapuaHardyNet> if they cannot pay it off, they see a decrease in profitability and the time required to pay off the card's expense goes up.
[12:34:39] <nshepperd2> but they do make AI more profitable, because you can train more powerful models
[12:34:55] <PapuaHardyNet> let's say the 30s series just got released and I know I shall make 5$ a day each card. Why is my demand for 3090s not infinite?
[12:35:21] <PapuaHardyNet> I know the next generation will release only in 2 years minimum and I can pay off all the 3090s within the year.
[12:35:50] <nshepperd2> depends on the price
[12:35:50] <PapuaHardyNet> this means for two years the profits will stay static, between 4-6$, and I can profit even more if I am strategic about when I liquidate my crypto assets
[12:36:12] <PapuaHardyNet> can you elaborate
[12:37:23] <nshepperd2> obviously, the price of 3090s will increase until crypto mining is barely profitable
[12:37:43] <nshepperd2> AI researchers will be able to buy as many as they want at that price
[12:39:29] <PapuaHardyNet> you are right. this doesn't change the fact that it makes building an AGI a far costlier prospect than assumed
[12:39:53] <nshepperd2> nah
[12:39:57] <PapuaHardyNet> which is why my 2100 timeline isn't as extreme as you think. Remove cryptomining and I'll be more confident about your 2070 timeline

[13:01:36] <feep> haha yeah
[13:05:45] <PapuaHardyNet> dbohdan2: yes, I manually type everything. It is very nice since I can grep the chat log for anything I want to reference or reread
[13:06:07] <PapuaHardyNet> "manually type everything" for the input, which means no tab completion for names
[13:06:28] <dbohdan> PapuaHardyNet: Do you have highlighting or notifications?
[13:07:15] <PapuaHardyNet> and the irc client is suckless' ii, in case you were wondering. no highlighting, no notifications. I simply manually read the log
[13:07:28] <dbohdan> I am asking, because you seem to miss messages address to you
[13:07:34] <dbohdan> * addressed
[13:08:09] <PapuaHardyNet> I do? sorry! manually reading and catching up isn't very robust
[13:08:18] <PapuaHardyNet> i'll fix that asap
[13:08:47] <dbohdan> PapuaHardyNet: I recommend finding a client that... sucks less
[13:11:09] <PapuaHardyNet> let me try implementing it using shell + ii first
[13:12:10] <PapuaHardyNet> test
[13:12:16] <dbohdan> PapuaHardyNet: Test
[13:12:29] <PapuaHardyNet> okay, implemented it using `tail -f out | grep "PapuaHardyNet"` on openbsd
[13:17:19] <nshepperd2> maybe it should have been called suckmore

[13:23:52] <PapuaHardyNet> I wonder how many people use the libera.chat matrix bridge to chat here
[13:24:11] <PapuaHardyNet> I've been considering it, especially since I've found a few matrix rooms worth idling in
[13:24:55] <dbohdan> PapuaHardyNet: Matrix is annoying to IRC users because it automatically puts long messages in a pastebin
[13:25:28] <PapuaHardyNet> yep, you should have seen #monero last year, full of those pastebin messages, made it almost impossible to participate in
[13:25:58] <dbohdan> You could script your client to retrieve them, I suppose
[13:26:35] <PapuaHardyNet> i'd rather not make other people in the chat suffer when I post a wall of text though
[13:27:06] <dbohdan> If you are looking for a more convenient way to access Libera Chat from OpenBSD, WeeChat is in the ports
[13:27:12] <PapuaHardyNet> anyway, somehow #monero has been cleared up recently and is free of such messages. although I believe that is mainly because we were in a bear market
[13:27:39] <dbohdan> Maybe Matrix has changed something?
[13:27:46] <PapuaHardyNet> hmm, lemme check
[13:28:28] <dbohdan> HexChat is in the ports, too

This PR also paves the way for other features (like reply formats).)
[13:29:17] <PapuaHardyNet> this is probably what they used.
[13:30:01] <PapuaHardyNet> also re: complex irc clients, I try to avoid them because I have to learn their quirks, and more importantly, logging is not easy. logging is a first class feature for ii, which is why I use it
[13:30:46] <dbohdan> Logging is a first-class feature in WeeChat.  It is even enabled by default.
[13:30:54] <PapuaHardyNet> it is? weechat is better than I realized
[13:31:09] <PapuaHardyNet> i'll try it eventually then
[13:31:39] <dbohdan> Really, what IRC clients have a problem with logging?
[13:32:03] <dbohdan> Looks like you are right: that commit fixed it.  Good job finding it.
[13:32:11] <dbohdan> s/commit/PR/
[13:32:23] <PapuaHardyNet> I had problems with reliable logging with irssi since it was optional

[21:10:18] <feep> because this is not how markets work, like, come the fuck on

[21:11:16] <gwern> loads of stuff costs more or is hard to get in california. paper straws, anyone?
[21:11:43] <gwern> or how about air filters? people were dying (literally, even?) for air filters only to discover that there are very few ones legal to ship to CA
[21:12:00] <gwern> markets definitely work like this. costs get built into prices
[21:12:10] <feep> yes, cost gets built into prices
[21:12:18] <gwern> and supply shocks certainly do exist
[21:12:20] <feep> but cost does not get built into "oh no, suddenly it is not available anymore"
[21:12:20] *** Joins: Fusxfaranto (~Fusxfaran@cpe-75-85-179-208.san.res.rr.com)
[21:12:38] <gwern> yes, it does, especially if there's a lot of uncertainty about what the cost even is
[21:12:42] <feep> at any rate, a law from 2018 does not count as "shock".
[21:13:16] <feep> you're basically proposing a theory of markets where producers keep free money on the table because they are gobsmacked by an event that happened years ago
[21:13:17] <gwern> a bitcoin halvening is not a shock. a 'we'll tell you someday what the rules may or may not be, btw you have to follow them real soon now' is a shock
[21:13:44] <gwern> a lottery is a shock no matter how many years in advance it is schedled
[21:13:53] <feep> okay, but then the problem is not at all the actual law
[21:14:00] <feep> but rather the weird way in which it is being introduced
[21:14:03] <feep> either way the article is shit
[21:14:05] <gwern> well yes it is, if the actual law doesn't even say what it is
[21:14:26] <gwern> of course, this is part of the general bureaucrtization and administration and judicialization of american society & economics
[21:14:26] <feep> I mean, whatever the content of the law will turn out to be is not the issue
[21:14:44] <dbohdan> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/86_(term)
[21:14:45] <Robomot> 86 (term) - Wikipedia (Eighty-six or 86 is American English slang used to indicate that an item is no longer available, traditionally from a food or drinks establishment; or referring to a person or people who are not welcome in the premises. Its etymology is unknown but seem to have been coined in the 1920s or 1930s. …)
[21:14:49] <gwern> voters & legislators punting on actually, y'know, legislating, and turning everything into 'administrative law'
[21:15:01] <feep> I am also against this
[21:15:10] <feep> but I note that this is not at all what the article is saying.
[21:15:16] <gwern> yes, it is
[21:15:26] <feep> "Bacon may disappear in California as pig rules take effect"
[21:15:36] <feep> "At the beginning of next year, California will begin enforcing an animal welfare proposition approved overwhelmingly by voters in 2018 that requires more space for breeding pigs, egg-laying chickens and veal calves."
[21:15:39] <feep> seems pretty clear!
[21:15:46] <gwern> that's not clear at all
[21:15:48] <feep> "Animal welfare organizations for years have been pushing for more humane treatment of farm animals but the California rules could be a rare case of consumers clearly paying a price for their beliefs. "
[21:15:58] <feep> yes, the problem is the beliefs and the rules
[21:16:06] <feep> that is what the article is saying
[21:16:11] <feep> for instance, it could be saying
[21:16:15] <gwern> 'requires more space' is about as specific as 'make more gooder and less badder'
[21:16:23] <feep> "Animal welfare organizations for years have been pushing for weird random unpredictable laws but the California rules could be a rare case of consumers clearly paying a price for their beliefs. "
[21:16:31] <gwern> (I too am in favor of more gooder and less badder, and will vote on this proposition accordingly)
[21:16:31] <feep> but it does not say that
[21:16:35] <feep> it says the problem is the humane treatment.
[21:17:00] <feep> and so it is shit.
[21:17:11] <gwern> it clearly says that the unpredictability is the problem
[21:17:15] <feep> yes, in the second half
[21:17:25] <gwern> and I'm amused that I actually created the gwernpaste quoting those parts before you weighed in
[21:17:33] <feep> behind the pagebreak
[21:17:41] <feep> where truth goes to die
[21:18:04] <feep> the article is basically "bla bla bla, but actually what we just smugly asserted is totally unrelated to the actual issue"
[21:18:08] <feep> this does not give you truth points!
[21:18:17] <feep> write it right from the first line!
[21:18:35] <Betawolf> "although the detailed regulations aren’t finished, the key rules about space have been known for years."
[21:18:41] <gwern> it seems accurate to me. voters voted in a nice sounding but underspecified and poorly thought through policy which will backfire and have problems
[21:18:46] <gwern> gee, that never happens in california!
[21:18:51] <feep> this is your projection of what the article is saying
[21:18:55] <feep> it is not at all what the article actually says.
[21:19:22] <feep> the article tries to farm smug rightwing outrage points
[21:19:29] <feep> I don't know why
[21:19:41] <feep> then it throws in the actual problem, almost grudgingly
[21:20:00] <feep> the first half of the article can be removed with very little loss
[21:20:13] <gwern> and correctly. of course it's going to raise costs! if it was neutral or more profitable, pig farmers would already do it. and of course it's going to be a supply shock if farmers *can't* comply with the rules because they don't know them, and supply shocks will further raise prices even above any long-term higher-cost equilibrium
[21:20:47] <feep> the article does not say it will raise costs!
[21:20:58] <feep> the article says **bacon may disappear**.
[21:21:01] <rmmh> Yes it does 
[21:21:09] <rmmh> It says $20 more per pig
[21:21:24] <feep> yes, later! it *retreats down* to "it may raise costs" after having promised the fucking baconpocalypse!
[21:21:38] <Betawolf> if only 4% of farms currently comply with the rules, then yes, pork in California will become scarcer and more expensive if they enforce this law
[21:21:45] <mst> the issue AFAICT is that ... right, what Betawolf said
[21:21:59] <feep> Betawolf: first of all, if they enforce this law, more than 4% of farms will begin to comply with the rules
[21:22:01] <feep> that is how laws work
[21:22:06] <Betawolf> right, but slowly
[21:22:11] <feep> I see no reason to expect that
[21:22:19] <feep> if I was farms, I'd already be preparing for this
[21:22:25] <gwern> it will disappear for the same reason that, say, those things that go on your face disappeared
[21:22:26] <Betawolf> 'getting more space' is nontrivial for farmers.
[21:22:28] <mst> feep: the law has existed for like two years and they knew when the deadline was
[21:22:29] <feep> but I wouldn't be preparing by giving pigs more space
[21:22:34] <rmmh> If you think this won't raise costs you may have the same California brain damage that means building houses won't lower rents 
[21:22:37] <feep> I'd cut it as close to the deadline as I could
[21:22:44] <feep> because I like money? this is how markets work?
[21:22:47] <Betawolf> especially US meat farmers who have been breeding pigs in cramped conditions
[21:22:52] <feep> rmmh: I fully think this will raise costs
[21:22:59] <feep> why the fuck are people saying that I think this won't raise costs
[21:23:03] <feep> I think this will raise costs significantly
[21:23:21] <feep> I just don't think "bacon will disappear in california", that is outrageous bullshit.
[21:23:31] <gwern> why did masks disappear? why does anything ever disappear?
[21:23:35] <feep> this article is pure motte/bailey.
[21:23:39] <Betawolf> I espect that California just mostly won't enforce this law.
[21:23:40] <feep> it is motte/bailey in *one article*.
[21:23:46] <mst> o/ why do birds / suddenly appear /
[21:23:49] <feep> Betawolf: yeah and so do the pig farms.
[21:23:59] <feep> that's why it's 4%.
[21:24:07] <Betawolf> feep: er, so do what?
[21:24:10] <feep> producers
[21:24:14] <feep> idk the word
[21:24:22] <mst> Betawolf: they don't expect california to enforece the law much either
[21:24:28] <Betawolf> oh right
[21:24:32] <gwern> (ie. a supply shock can result in shortages as prices rise so high that sellers will refuse to sell the available indigenous bacon at the market-clearing price for fear of consumer backlash / permanent habitual changes / price-gouging PR or prosecution, and prefer to instead simply let rationing and shortages make the market clear, because irrational consumers won't blame *them* for that)
[21:24:36] <Betawolf> yeah, that fits
[21:24:42] <feep> gwern: I agree that is a thing that can happen
[21:24:45] * mst got a decent roll on his en_FEEP check
[21:24:57] <feep> but "bacon may be scarce for a few months" is *still* not the same as "bacon may disappear in california"!
[21:25:04] <feep> this article is pure fearmongering!
[21:25:17] <gwern> bacon can totally disappear off shelves, as I just explained
[21:25:22] <feep> temporarily!
[21:25:24] <feep> that's kind of important!
[21:25:37] <feep> and I still don't expect it to happen
[21:25:39] <gwern> sure, temporarily. where does it ever say it'd be permanent?
[21:25:51] <feep> gwern if I say "you will disappear from this planet"
[21:25:58] <Betawolf> bacon exclusion zone
[21:26:00] <feep> er
[21:26:05] <feep> gwern if I say "you will disappear from the surface of this earth"
[21:26:13] <feep> I am not thereby suggesting that you are going to take a hop.
[21:26:16] <gwern> then I will clap politely when I reappear in front of the audience
[21:26:29] <rmmh> gwern: I expect they'll just sell to restaurants that can absorb the price 
[21:26:42] <mst> yeah, it'll be fine
[21:26:43] <feep> the default meaning of "disappear" is "permanently, or at length"
[21:26:45] <feep> this is basic english
[21:26:49] <feep> you think the ap doesn't know this
[21:26:52] <mst> it's not like restaurants have had anything bad happen to them in the last year or two
[21:27:10] <feep> I really don't know why ya'll are defending this rubbish
[21:27:12] <gwern> it could be lengthy. depends on how long they delay the regs
[21:27:25] <feep> yes, californian incompetence can make it arbitrarily bad
[21:27:28] <gwern> farms don't revise their physical layout and construction overnight
[21:27:28] <feep> I do not disagree with this
[21:27:32] <mst> feep: I'm not defending the article, I -am- saying there's quite possibly going to be a problem
[21:27:37] <feep> mst: and I agree with that
[21:27:45] <gwern> and it being california, there's a good chance they'll make it arbitrarily bad for arbitrarily long. see: SF.
[21:27:48] <feep> I just think the first half of the article severely misrepresents both the problem and its causes.
[21:28:00] <Betawolf> It's an exaggerated title, sure, but it's hardly an extreme exaggeration for a news article. They even say 'may'. 
[21:28:05] <feep> gwern: yes, and that is **still** not what the article is asserting!
[21:28:19] <rmmh> not having systems to label and track through slaughter will certainly complicate things 
[21:28:49] <feep> gwern: the article is asserting, effectively, cruelty good regulation bad
[21:28:59] <feep> not "californian governing skill bad"
[21:29:11] <gwern> rmmh: yeah, that'll be fun. maybe they'll deal with that by switching over entire farms. they have to be able to track already at least by farm for food safety
[21:29:44] <feep> the whole thing about the problem with the regs only comes in after the middle, before that it paints a completely different (wrong) picture
[21:29:58] <feep> it's like they switched writers
[21:31:13] <feep> hell, if you asked an AI to assign the first half and the second half to political orientations, you'd get very different results imo
[21:31:42] <feep> beh, I don't live there anyways
[21:31:54] <gwern> uh... what? this is typical inverted pyramid style. like the second topic / 6th sentence even explains the problem: few are compatible with the regs, it'll be long to switch over leading to shortages, and it'll be more expensive afterwards
[21:32:15] <gwern> 'At the beginning of next year, California will begin enforcing an animal welfare proposition approved overwhelmingly by voters in 2018 that requires more space for breeding pigs, egg-laying chickens and veal calves. National veal and egg producers are optimistic they can meet the new standards, but only 4% of hog operations now comply with the new rules. Unless the courts intervene or the...
[21:32:21] <gwern> ...state temporarily allows non-compliant meat to be sold in the state, California will lose almost all of its pork supply, much of which comes from Iowa, and pork producers will face higher costs to regain a key market.'
[21:32:46] <gwern> that's the 5th to 7th sentence in the article. seems perfectly clear and correct to me
[21:33:17] <gwern> (and the first 4 are just short human-interest fluff a reader will skim)

[21:37:17] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: anyway, I had another idea about how to make tagged links useful: I can exploit (Markdown) pages as 'tags' (using the backlink db, ofc). So all the links on /GPT-3-fiction get a 'gpt-3-fiction' tag etc. this prioritizes those backlinks since they do in fact function as quasi-tags when I dump all relevant links into a specific page, and it also paves the way to restoring link...

[21:37:23] <gwern> ...bibliographies: if links are tagged with page-tags, then their annotations can be dumped as big HTML files, analogous to the old separate-annotation pages, and then simply transcluded into the page on-demand, without having to traverse the page for every link, query for every single little separate annotation file, compiling them together, and *then* transcluding

[21:38:58] <gwern> dbohdan: yep, same reason. people trade up as they stop being peasants, but beef is still too far out of reach for the global middleclass to eat too much of
[21:39:12] <feep> mst: er, I can't read spiegel cause it doesn't have a cookieless option
[21:39:16] <feep> but that'd be interesting
[21:39:44] <gwern> dbohdan: I'm sure there's vastly many more examples beyond this. cost is such a driver of choice and menu

[21:40:35] <feep> good idea
[21:40:45] <rmmh> and certainly not refrigerated
[21:41:01] <rmmh> So fruit /produce was regional and seasonal
[21:41:13] <Obormot\Gaia> gwern: Ah yes, the "time is a flat circle" model of software development
[21:41:59] <gwern> rmmh: well, it's a bit more complicated than that. refrigerated shipping was very much a thing, and making big advances - freeze-plates on factory ships is why frozen fish could be a thing, and that led to fish sticks
[21:42:17] <rmmh> "avocado toast" as a punchline wouldn't make sense at all in 1940
[21:42:26] <feep> mst: but yeah, I think from what I can see spiegel is a lot more uh, "summary, human element, facts, human throughline, we went to talk with an expert, another expert disagrees, human element ending"
[21:42:51] <gwern> actually, I was surprised when my aunts were talking and they mentioned how they'd buy blocks of fish and it was such a pain to defrost the block and chip the fish apart. I'd read about that in the fishstick paper, but it had described it as a very brief, temporary unpopular experiment that failed. I had no idea my relatives had actually used it!

[22:37:35] <dbohdan2> I wonder about Justine Tunney.  She is clearly a top-notch programmer with an eye for clever hacks, but when she boasts like "I'm the author of the fastest open source HTTP server. Parsing HTTP 0.9, 1.0, and 1.1 is trivial. It's a walk in the park. It only takes about a hundred lines of code to create a proper O(n) parser." "Messages per second, latency, footprint, name it." I trust her work less.  (Not
[22:37:36] <dbohdan2> that I can see anything wrong with parser at a glance.)

[22:44:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> This Watership Down commentary is bizarre
[22:45:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Now, Watership Down is brilliant and amazing, and has one big problem. That problem is the first sixty-five pages. ... " The first 65 pages are a slog -- the first time you read the book through. ... Sadly, the first 65 pages are infinitely more interesting once you've finished the book and start over again. This, of course, is no help for the first time reader."
[22:45:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> What the heck is she talking about? I had no such trouble with the first any number of pages
[22:45:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> And I have a fairly low tolerance for a book making me slog through boring bullshit
[22:46:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> "The first problem is that the reader has absolutely no reason to care about any of these characters or the peril they're in yet." ... I mean, yes, but that's built up as you go ... just like in any other book ... the characters get characterization, development, personalities *immediately*!
[22:46:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's one thing I liked about the book, actually
[22:46:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> Many books, you start out not caring and you keep not caring
[22:46:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> _Watership Down_ is notable for *not* being like that
[22:47:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> "We don't initially know whether to believe the prophet's prediction of doom for staying" ... duh? Why would we know that initially? That would be dumb
[22:48:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> "In fact, [the characters'] handling of peril is initially so inept, it's hard to care." ??? isn't that the whole damn point?? They're rabbits

[22:57:53] <gwern> (hm. good news and bad news about my parallelization changes last night: the good news is that I've realized they did speed it up a ton; the bad news is I realized this because the original version has been compiling gwern.net for 40 minutes now and is maybe 2/3rds done)
[23:01:26] <dbohdan> gwern: Is your build mostly IO-bound or CPU-bound?
[23:01:37] <gwern> this is all CPU bound due to the regexp rewrites
