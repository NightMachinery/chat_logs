[15:14:52] <Wulf> theglass: most likely. Got a more specific question?
[15:14:58] <Wulf> Could someone help me debug the "Clear-Site-Data" feature? Goal is to have a logout button on my "basic auth" protected server. The logout page sends 'Clear-Site-Data: "*"' but when I then go back to the index page, the browser (firefox+chromium) won't try to reload the page from the server and shows the page from cache. https://logout.wulf.eu.org/  test / test
[15:15:08] <theglass> hi Wulf
[15:17:05] <theglass> yes.. I'm experiencing a lot of redirecting errors when it comes to redirect to login/landing pages
[15:17:39] <theglass> with the latest beta(s)
[15:18:12] <theglass> 96.0b*

[16:50:35] <Timvde> theglass: 503 means "Service unavailable", it's supposed to be a server error...

[17:08:19] <ede> theglass: i like the shell, so maybe i'd copy the request heareds, possibly steal the cookies and try to find out which part of the request makes the difference.
[17:08:25] <ede> curl that is.
[17:16:59] <theglass> I like that too. In fact, it seems to be a useragent issue
[17:17:50] <theglass> it seemed to be
[17:18:53] <theglass> because there's also a problem with some extension which became uncompatible or so. So the extension (or firefox itself) it didn't reset the useragent to the default one
[17:21:00] <theglass> what puzzled me a little bit was that the problem was happening for every release or beta in the 96 line
[17:21:25] <theglass> so even updating didn't solve.. but well.
[17:22:44] <theglass> oh, even disabling all the installed extension, or using an anonymous session didn't solve
