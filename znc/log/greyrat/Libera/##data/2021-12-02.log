[21:53:28] <slaughter> Does anyone have a good refresh strategy for lots of dependent Redshift materialized views? We're having a nightmare time getting any consistency due (assumingly) to the huge CPU cost and lack of return values on a REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW query
[21:53:37] <slaughter> Tried Eventbridge for scheduled Redshift queries and it was pretty much a non-starter. Moved to a scheduled query in Redash and it turns out to have been failing quietly (due to lack of return value) for a while
[21:54:39] <slaughter> These MVs are pretty huge and need to refresh off-hours, otherwise we have to scale our cluster to eye popping levels to run them
