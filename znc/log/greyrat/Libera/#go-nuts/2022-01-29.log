[02:10:30] <domino14> Hi all. I have this loop in a function and I guess I still don't understand channels or something. https://dpaste.org/G5Pr#
[02:11:07] <domino14> when I call `cancel()` outside this function, it prints out this line log.Info().Msg("pubsub context done, draining subscriptions")
[02:11:11] <domino14> hundreds of thousands of times
[02:11:48] <domino14> i don't understand why. why would case <-ctx.Done keep triggering over and over again? I only canceled once
[02:12:15] <fizzie> Because the channel gets closed when you cancel.
[02:12:27] <fizzie> And a closed channel is *always* ready for receiving (a zero value) from.
[02:12:58] <b0nn> domino14: once you handle ctx.Done() the loop starts again
[02:14:05] <fizzie> Here's one potential way to handle the situation where you need to stay in the loop for a while: before the loop, do `done := ctx.Done()`, and in the `case <-done:` do `done = nil` to essentially take it out of the select.
[02:14:06] <b0nn> the only time you leave that loop is when you read from exit
[02:15:08] <b0nn> are you expecting line 26 to call the exit case when the done case is handled?
[02:15:14] <domino14> thanks, i see now. Yes, I need to stay in the loop for a little while, while it's draining messages
[02:15:20] <b0nn> hmm call isn't the right word
[02:15:24] <domino14> yes i am
[02:15:47] <domino14> instead it seems like i started like 1 million timers :D

[02:16:15] <domino14> so that done = nil certainly seems like a hack. is that the best way?

[02:16:21] <domino14> let me try it anyway
[02:17:07] <fizzie> A nil channel is pretty much the opposite of a closed channel when it comes to select: it can never be received from.

[02:17:34] <fizzie> Another alternative would be to fall out of the loop and have a *different* loop for the "I've been canceled, but I'm still doing some work" situation.
[02:19:11] <foobaz> it doesn't seem like a hack to me, i think it's an elegant solution
[02:19:54] <fizzie> Which one's better may depend on how similarly (or differently) you need the code to behave in the "before cancel" and "after cancel" situations.

[02:26:41] <foobaz> if done is a local variable, it has no effect on other goroutines
[02:26:52] <domino14> got briefly disconnected. is there a log for this chat?
[02:27:41] <domino14> so the solution seems to work, but my test fails. not sure if that's because sending messages and immediately draining maybe doesn't work as i expect it to

[02:30:55] <domino14> ah, it appears that if I publish messages to the NATS channels, and i immediately cancel() (so that the drain starts immediately), it doesn't actually receive the msgs. hm
[02:31:06] <domino14> so it's not actually "draining" properly..

[05:32:56] *** Joins: pieguy128 (~pieguy128@bras-base-mtrlpq5031w-grc-37-70-24-250-178.dsl.bell.ca)
[05:33:21] <fizzie> Not for the result of make, but you can write `&map[string][]string{}`.
[05:34:29] <fizzie> (There's a special dispensation for applying & to a composite literal.)
[05:35:21] <Fuzai> Oh, ok, thank you :)
[05:37:32] <fizzie> FWIW, having a pointer to a map in the first place is a pretty odd thing to do.
[05:38:25] <fizzie> A map value is already pretty much pointer-like.
[05:40:26] <Fuzai> I have a really basic http server where one thread is polling a database and swapping a map in of the current results of a sql query.  The thing is it is easier to start with a blank map, populate, and swap in, than try to update in place
[05:40:53] <fizzie> Fair, but you don't need a pointer for that. You can "swap in" a map by just assigning map values around.
[05:41:12] <Fuzai> I'm also really new to doing golang specifically so I'll take any advice
[05:43:15] <Fuzai> Originally, I was trying to avoid using globals to complete this task, but after reading online, people kept saying if it's something simple and small, globals are ok, as long as you understand what you are doing
[05:49:21] <fizzie> Mm, well. That's reasonable enough. But if you're writing to a variable from one goroutine and reading from another, strictly speaking some synchronization is needed to guarantee goroutine A observes the write from goroutine B.

[14:24:00] <bq> Almost accidentally joined #no-guts instead. If I'm streaming JSON objects down over an io.Reader and I want to unmarshal it to a different struct depending on a "type" field, is there a better way to do this than buffer the JSON string and unmarshal it twice: once to extract "type" and a second time to get my final, full unmarshaling after knowing the type?
[14:26:13] <j416> haha. no-guts.
[14:26:32] <j416> bq: if by that you mean to a json.RawMessage field, then I think not really
[14:26:51] <j416> the json needs to be parsed to get the type out
[14:27:29] <bq> Ah yeah, RawMessage not string heh
[14:27:58] <j416> you might be able to get away with using the tokenizer or a third-party json parser, but seems like premature optimization unless you're already there trying to make it faster
[14:28:09] <bq> yeah true
[14:28:57] <bq> I thought maybe there was some magic dance I was missing but I guess not. I guess it'd make more sense for the author of this protocol to indicate the message's type in a more hierarchical way

[14:31:09] <j416> has worked fine for me
[14:31:48] <bq> Yeah seems more efficient on CPU than decoding to a map[string]interface{}, peeking, then re-serialisng that to JSON and unmarshaling into a struct
[14:31:57] <j416> definitely
[14:32:13] <j416> and you also have the option to just store the data as-is to parse at a later time (json.RawMessage is []byte)
[14:32:29] <bq> true

[22:49:05] <senoraraton> Is there a place that can explain to me how to structure my project?  I'm getting errors because I'm trying to move things out of a single file
[22:53:48] <jimeh> senoraraton: are you extracting things into new files in the same directory?
[22:55:31] <j416> senoraraton: https://go.dev/doc/code
[22:56:00] <senoraraton> No, I'm building a full stack application.  So I'm trying to move my "main" function to a relatively benign file that just starts the server.  The actual nuts and bolts are in their own files
[22:58:00] <senoraraton> Will I need to init the seperate "sub-modules" in their own directory, am I understanding that correctly
[22:58:11] <j416> packages.
[22:59:51] <j416> function main should be in package main
[22:59:55] <j416> one directory is one package
[23:00:05] <j416> you cannot import package main
[23:00:21] <senoraraton> So my database implementation is in package db and its in db.go that needs its own directory?
[23:00:59] <j416> testing aside, you cannot have multiple packages in the same directory
[23:02:43] <crashrep> the way i do multiple file compiling is every file is package main and i just write it like every file were concatanated into one large one
[23:02:48] <crashrep> that might not be useful for your use case
[23:02:49] <jimeh> Yeah, each directory is a package, so every Go file in the same directory must have the same package declaration at the top of it… then you import packages into other packages where you need them… and the “main” package name is special as only a main package can start the app, and main packages can’t be imported…
[23:04:18] <crashrep> otherwise you have to put the other packages into subdirectories of the main working directory and import them into every file
[23:04:46] <jimeh> As far as code is concerned, there’s no real difference between having a single go file in a directory, or lots of small files in the same directory, there’s no concept of importing other files in the directory like in most languages… you just import other packages…
[23:05:09] <crashrep> yes
[23:05:37] <senoraraton> I.e. if the variable is declared in file1.go and I want to use it in file2.go I can just reference it as long as they are both part of the same package(in the same working directory), correct?
[23:05:52] <jimeh> senoraraton: exactly :)
[23:06:03] <crashrep> yes, but just be careful about namespace. I.e. if you define the variable outside of all functions then it does work that way
[23:08:17] *** Quits: Techcable (~Techcable@168.235.93.147) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[23:08:33] <jimeh> Basically think of all go files within a directory as basically all being part of the same file, scope-vise at least… the only differing thing between files in the same package would be the imports, as each file should only have imports which are used within that file, but tools like goimports and gopls can automatically take care of adding/removing imports as you use them…
[23:08:34] <senoraraton> https://medium.com/@benbjohnson/standard-package-layout-7cdbc8391fc1
[23:08:45] <j416> that's a good article.
[23:10:40] <jimeh> There’s lots of different ways to structure projects… personally I try to break things down into self-contained conceptual problem domains, and create packages around those things…
[23:11:19] <senoraraton> Ultimately I'm putting the cart before the horse, but its nice to know what is possible, and understand how the ecosystem interacts so that you CAN compartmentalize, should you choose to.
[23:11:51] <jimeh> As far as package naming/structure, the only other rule I think of is that any packages placed under a “internal” folder will prevent them from being imported outside of that project…
[23:12:23] <j416> senoraraton: sounds sane. Just package main can get you quite far.
