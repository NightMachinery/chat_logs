[05:54:40] <brachamh> hey i'm using cron to start unrealircd, anope services, and znc bouncer. it appears that unrealircd needs to start before anope. what's the best way to set this up? not using a @reboot line, and just having the unrealircd cron run at 5m, and anope at 6m?
[05:55:04] <brachamh> or is there a delay option for a @reboot line?
[05:55:22] <sney> why cron, instead of your init system?
[05:55:52] *** Quits: ax56234 (~NickServ@user/ax562) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[05:56:34] <brachamh> it's how all three programs recommend, plus cron then runs the script every x minutes to ensure the programs are still running
[05:58:37] <brachamh> just reading up on cron syntax...and it seems some of the syntax may be wrong. going to read more and then do some testing
[05:58:44] <sney> ok, well, systemd lets services have dependencies, so you can tell a service to only start after a different service. which would solve this neatly without having any race conditions. 
[05:59:00] *** onelegend is now known as cryptonerd
[05:59:12] *** cryptonerd is now known as onelegend
[05:59:23] <sney> if cron is a must, then I'd consider having cron call a helper script for each subsequent service that checks if the pre-req service is running before launching the actual daemon
[06:00:03] <sney> otherwise, yes, you'll be doing timer math and everyone will be racing to the finish at the same time. and it might work most of the time.
[06:00:11] <brachamh> that's true about systemd, i have read that. i haven't really delved into that yet though so i would have to figure that out, which i may end up doing.

[06:01:38] *** Quits: snoot (~snoot@user/snoot) (Quit: leaving)
[06:01:39] <brachamh> or i may figure out some combination script that checks if unrealircd is running, and if it isn't, starts it. then checks on anope, and if unrealircd had to be restarted, (re)start anope.
[06:01:53] <brachamh> have cron run that every so often
[06:02:08] <brachamh> does that make sense?
[06:02:45] *** onelegend is now known as Pizzaman6969
[06:02:46] <sney> yeah, similar to my suggestion with the helper script, only having one script for all of them. it's more complicated than writing systemd units and basically re-implements what systemd would already do.
[06:02:52] <sney> but it does let you keep cron involved. 
[06:02:53] *** Pizzaman6969 is now known as onelegend
[06:03:05] <brachamh> would systemd continue to make sure they're running?
[06:03:35] *** Joins: snoot (~snoot@user/snoot)
[06:03:37] <sney> yes, that's an option for service definitions

[06:04:19] <sney> right 
[06:04:42] <brachamh> ok i will start reading on systemd then
[06:05:23] <sney> this page is a little dense, but you can scroll down to find examples near the bottom, and then scroll back up for term explanations: https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.unit.html
[06:06:28] <brachamh> ok. a search turned up a howtogeek page on it, which i usually find pretty well written

[18:31:51] <mmm4m5m> This could be the most simple solution. I do not have ssh server on host PC. I never needed it.
[18:32:49] <mmm4m5m> "set UID" did not help. (because I tried with: $ UID=1000 tcpserver...)

[22:06:18] <karma> I was kind of stuck on Mint for over 3 years but finally found a way to use Debian. Have used Debian before. Linux about 10 years.
[22:07:53] <pasiz> way to use debian starts from installing. hope you like it. I have tested debian first time 1996
[22:08:32] <karma> I think I tested SuSE circa 2000 but it didn't work very well. Linux has come  a long way.
