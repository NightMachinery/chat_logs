[01:10:11] <Voxel> Hey all ^^
[01:10:24] <Voxel> Is it okay to say "This band is astonishing!"
[01:10:56] <LuisP14> hmm
[01:19:50] <Voxel> So?!
[01:19:55] <Voxel> Aahah
[01:20:07] <Voxel> I'm looking at this "hhm" 10 minutes!
[01:20:09] <furrykef> It's not wrong, but perhaps an unlikely choice of word
[01:20:45] <Voxel> I'm trying to replace boring "great", "amazing", "cool" etc.
[01:20:59] <furrykef> It almost makes it sound like you can barely believe they play so well
[01:21:16] <Voxel> Indeed, it sounds like it
[01:21:23] <Voxel> stupendous is even worse
[01:21:33] <Voxel> I don't like this word. It sounds like stupid :D
[01:21:42] <furrykef> Well, they are related words
[01:22:09] <Voxel> Say what?!
[01:22:40] <Voxel> I thought it's from "stupere"
[01:22:58] <furrykef> Both "stupid" and "stupendous" are from "stupere", yes
[01:23:04] <Voxel> Oh...
[01:23:29] <furrykef> "stupid" just underwent a semantic shift that other related words (like "stupefy") didn't
[01:23:36] <LuisP14> stupendous  — etymology: 1. First attested from 1547, from Late Latin stupendus (“stunning, amazing”), from Latin stupeo (“(I) am stunned”).
[01:23:38] <Voxel> So it's probably something like "It's so stupidly incredible!"
[01:23:58] <LuisP14> stupid  — etymology: 1. From Middle French stupide, from Latin stupidus (“struck senseless, amazed”), from stupeō (“be amazed or confounded, be struck senseless”), from Proto-Indo-European *(s)tup-, *(s)tewp- (“to wonder”), ..
[01:25:13] <Voxel> What would you use to describe a great, but not the most incredible band? 70% of awesomeness.
[01:25:39] <Voxel> 80%*
[01:25:49] <LuisP14> i guess it wouldn't be a shift if coming like that from the origin
[01:27:36] <furrykef> Maybe instead of trying to pack all this into an adjective, you should say something more specific
[01:28:02] <StayHungry> 'they blow up my mind' :)
[01:28:23] <furrykef> You probably meant "blow my mind"
[01:28:29] <StayHungry> :D
[01:28:32] <furrykef> "blow up" makes it sound like they planted a bomb in your skull

[01:42:04] <furrykef> I'd answer the question, but unfortunately I don't know the answer
[01:43:10] <furrykef> Wikipedia says, "In contrast to the practice of the Moravian Church and Lutheran Churches, the early Reformed Churches rejected the use of the crucifix, and indeed the unadorned cross, along with other traditional religious imagery, as idolatrous."

[06:18:10] <StayHungry> let's see what i have here that sounds like actual songs... :)
[06:20:04] <tinwhiskers> Oh, right. I did listen to that.

[12:58:49] <rud0lf> or, easier question, when one is wrong to use and the other is right?
[13:00:06] <rud0lf> also, are "wanna" "gotta" etc. oxford correct or are they common language taken as bad by english teachers?

[13:01:50] <rud0lf> idioms, cultural phrases - jokes, abbreviations
[13:03:25] <tinwhiskers> "you get to be" means you've been given an opportunity to do something good, and "you have to be" means you are required to regardless of whether it is good or not.
[13:03:41] <rud0lf> i think i speak english and then i overhear a phrase that sounds like "i had to ask my PR to lower my TCD or i wouldn't roll that radish around"

[14:10:26] <snappy> yeah i think i found it, it's all under https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear_clearing : The "Valsalva maneuver": pinching the nose and closing the mouth and trying to breathe out through the nose.[2][5][7][8] If the hand cannot reach the nose, it is possible to learn to pinch the nose shut by the action of two small face muscles called compressor naris. This is the first technique normally taught,
[14:10:28] <snappy> but needs to be performed gently to lessen side-effects.[7]
[14:16:58] <snappy> apparently spacesuits are equipped with a valsalva device to clear the ears/balance the pressure

[18:16:25] <Voxel> Hey all ^^
[18:16:51] <Voxel> How would you call an action when developers include Easter Eggs in their projects from other universes.
[18:17:21] <Voxel> For example, Duke Nukem guy in Serious Sam game.
[18:17:40] <Voxel> Some kind of a reference, but..
[18:19:15] <Voxel> Universe crossing?
[18:22:20] <Babar> just call it a reference?
[18:22:23] <Babar> or an easter egg?
[18:22:29] <Babar> an easter egg reference

[18:46:52] <Voxel> Hm...
[18:46:56] <Voxel> It's different
[18:47:10] <Voxel> It's like universe fusion
[18:49:35] <Voxel> Like these marvelous guys: Serious Sam, Duke Nukem, Doom, Wolfenstein, Shadow Warrior. They mention each other in their universes.
[18:49:55] <Voxel> Developers include their references
[18:53:43] <Babar> I know what you mean
[18:53:51] <Babar> would just call it a reference, though
[18:54:23] <Babar> it would be an easter egg, and what type of easter egg, a reference
[18:54:43] <Babar> I mean, talking about such references in media can only usually mean one thing, and that's the thing you described

[19:13:54] *** Quits: jess (~jess@libera/staff/jess) ()
[19:14:46] <huf> Voxel: is that the word you were looking for? cos I dont think it's the word you actually need here, but ... :)
[19:16:31] <Voxel> Yes! This is closer!
[19:16:34] <StayHungry> Voxel: what's the original question?
[19:17:03] <huf> Voxel: problem is, a crossover isnt just a stray reference
[19:17:26] <huf> it's more like if you have the starship enterprise and the millennium falcon meet and have an adventure together
[19:17:29] <Voxel> How would you call an action when developers include Easter Eggs in their projects from other universes with an actual purpose. For example: https://youtu.be/LTmhtN8jESM
[19:18:02] <huf> that's just an easter egg referencing duke nukem
[19:18:15] <Voxel> Then it comes to: https://www.artstation.com/artwork/12wbe
[19:19:25] <huf> that's more like it
[19:19:27] <Voxel> Is it just an Easter Egg?
[19:19:37] <huf> yeah
[19:19:40] <huf> what was expendables though?
[19:19:43] <huf> was that a crossover?
[19:19:57] <huf> it was some kind of pun on crossovers
[19:20:01] <Voxel> I'd call a Half-Life crowbar an Easter Egg
[19:20:04] <Voxel> But this is more
[19:20:11] <huf> eh
[19:20:22] <huf> if it's easy to find and part of the normal story, then it's not an easter egg
[19:20:24] <huf> it's just a weird thing
[19:20:41] <huf> but otherwise. the flight sim in excel was also an easter egg
[19:20:46] <Voxel> So this weird thing is a crossover
[19:21:42] <Voxel> Yes. These one posted above is quite easy to find.
[19:22:01] <Voxel> This one is interesting: https://youtu.be/5u4Ed48c_X0
[19:23:24] <huf> does that one scarecrow joke in top secret make it a crossover with the wizard of oz?
[19:23:27] <huf> I dont think so :)
[19:25:27] <huf> https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Crossover/Film
[19:25:34] <huf> https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Crossover/VideoGames
[19:26:28] <huf> I dont know what to call the type of crossover where basically one thing gets trapped in the gravity well of another and the two are drawn together
[19:26:33] <huf> basically inevitably
[19:26:37] <huf> like half life and portal
[19:26:45] <Voxel> This is closer to the previous Neir Automata reference: https://youtu.be/we2w9kxVSM4
[19:26:53] <Voxel> Oops: https://youtu.be/we2w9kxVSM4?t=106
[19:27:23] <huf> or asimov's two great series
[19:27:37] <huf> or tolkien's hobbit and all the other stuff
[19:28:53] <Voxel> I see. So, you'd call a crossover when product contains either a protagonist or antagonist from multiple universes
[19:29:02] <Voxel> Correct?
[19:29:25] *** Joins: kerfluffy (~kerfluffy@user/kerfluffy)
[19:29:36] <huf> where it's not just a one-off bit
[19:29:49] <huf> that you could cut out and still have the thing basically the same
[19:30:09] <huf> that's my feeling about it
[19:30:26] <Voxel> I see
[19:32:13] <huf> you cant cut out the alien from alien vs predator for example
[19:32:20] <huf> you wouldnt have a movie left
[19:32:26] <huf> (not that you have a movie there... but anyway)
[19:32:48] <Voxel> I see!
[19:33:20] <Voxel>  The team added the Beheaded Kamikaze, an enemy from the Serious Sam series, as an Easter egg to Temple of the Sun, a 2014 expansion for Hammerwatch. Considering to turn the Easter egg official, Skoglund got in contact with...
[19:33:25] <Voxel> Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serious_Sam%27s_Bogus_Detour
[19:37:01] <Voxel> So, there are three: Reference, Crossover and Spinoff
[19:37:05] <Voxel> Right?
[19:37:14] <huf> there's probably a lot more, but yeah
[19:37:15] <Voxel> + Easter Egg
[19:37:17] <huf> those are three things.
[19:37:32] <huf> really, have a look at tvtropes :)
[19:37:43] <huf> we'll send sandwiches if you're not back by next month
[19:38:14] <Voxel> I opened it, but it listed crossover titles
[19:38:22] <Voxel> Not the word definitions
[19:38:40] <huf> https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Crossover
[19:38:44] <huf> this is the main article
[19:38:56] <Voxel> I see. Thank you very much! 
[19:41:43] <huf> where's a japanese person when you need one
[19:42:42] <LuisP18> that's a lot of terminology
[19:43:25] <LuisP18> what do you need one for? :p
[19:43:34] <huf> to find out how the IJN was abbreviated in Japanese
[19:43:46] <huf> I'm P sure they didnt write the whole fuckin name out all the time
[19:46:54] <Voxel> Interesitng...
[19:47:10] <LuisP18> hmm 日本海軍 o-o
[19:47:26] <huf> yeah
[19:47:38] <Voxel> Does anyone know why does it reference Indiana Jones? Is it the huge ball scene? https://youtu.be/88NDv66G0gI 
[19:47:38] <huf> I have no idea what strategies the Japanese use for abbreviation
[19:47:53] <huf> at least... I think they just mash the first few syllables of words together to get a new word?
[19:48:08] <huf> they definitely do that, but is that the only strategy?
[19:48:14] <Voxel> The title tells it's a reference, so... curious if it's true
[19:48:48] <huf> like burapi
[19:48:55] <Voxel> OH!
[19:49:03] <Voxel> I didn't watch the video clip to the end!
[19:49:23] <Voxel> Forgot the whisper! Heck.. I played this game ~15 years ago..

[19:51:32] <huf> fuck me, Dieppe is pronounced "deep" in English?
[19:52:24] <huf> no it isnt!
[19:52:40] <huf> the ww2 dude mispronounced it!
[19:53:19] <LuisP18> o.o
[19:57:20] * LuisP18 finds 日本軍  ... meh
[19:57:23] <StayHungry> Voxel: yes, it refers to the intro scene of 'Indiana Jones and the raiders of the lost ark'
