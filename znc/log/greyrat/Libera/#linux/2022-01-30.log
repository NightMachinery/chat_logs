[02:09:51] <znf> You can't rely on networks having UPnP enabled
[02:09:59] <Intelo> Is it a great solution that works all the time? if not, why would it not work?
[02:10:06] *** Joins: joilerv (~joilerv@135.129.250.144)
[02:10:08] <ayecee> it's not a great solution and it doesn't work all the time.
[02:10:14] <mlu> Intelo: lack of wide support
[02:10:15] <Intelo> oh so upnp can be disabled as well?
[02:10:15] <ayecee> it wouldn't work because not every network supports it.
[02:10:22] <mlu> Intelo: yeah, and it usually is
[02:10:24] <ayecee> even those that do, often disable it.
[02:10:30] <znf> UPnP won't help you in CGNAT scenarios
[02:10:33] <Intelo> so its the  'network' that supports upnpn. not the router?
[02:10:35] <mlu> I usually disable it beacuse most things don't use it and it's a security liability

[02:10:54] <ayecee> Intelo: you only really see upnp on a home network, where it's for the convenience of a very small group of people.
[02:11:03] <ayecee> no, it's the router.
[02:11:20] <ayecee> Intelo: i'm concerned how you can not just forget details, but remember them as their exact opposite.
[02:11:23] <Intelo> Is there a protocol that is ready to use that I can take adavantage of? It seems not a good idea to reinvent the wheel
[02:11:33] <mlu> it really boils down to a mater of security tradeoffs: p2p requires you to interact with peers

[02:11:50] *** Quits: xb0o2 (~xb0o2@user/xb0o2) (Quit: Leaving)

[02:13:34] <Sauvin> Oh, the _concept_ is fine, and yes, a great deal depends on your (supposed) online social milieu.
[02:13:51] <mlu> modern Windows actually uses p2p to distribute updates among systems on the same LAN

[09:59:08] <_xor> Need some feedback. I have haproxy as the public-facing proxy that currently terminates https & then routes the http requests to various back-ends, which are usually nginx proxies.

[10:00:06] <_xor> I want to add client cert auth, though I'd ideally add it to nginx (I think), since different applications have different needs and would be easier to manage them there then centralized at haproxy.
[10:00:32] <mlu> _xor: why do you even have haproxy in the picture?
[10:00:41] <_xor> I'm trying to figure out which trade-offs I'm going to have to make to do this without compromising security.
[10:01:01] <mlu> _xor: strictly speaking, in isolation, nginx is the easier place to put them, but the client certs should be handled by whatever is handling the SSL termination
[10:01:15] <mlu> so client certs handled in nginx = transparent passthru in haproxy
[10:01:26] <mlu> see where that gets a little complicated?
[10:01:39] <_xor> Right, I get that part.
[10:01:47] <_xor> Assume haproxy has to be there (long story).
[10:01:53] <_xor> I actually like haproxy anyway.
[10:01:59] <mlu> I'd suggest handling the client certs partially in haproxy but translating that to a trusted header (sorry, zero-trust people)
[10:02:00] <_xor> I'm just exploring options.
[10:02:06] <_xor> Right.
[10:02:31] <mlu> but then haproxy communicates with your nginx stuff on a separate server-to-server encrypted connection of its own
[10:02:32] <_xor> That's one thing I was contemplating, but I'm trying to think of ways that might break upstream with nginx and/or how I'd configure that part of it on the various applications.

[10:03:18] <mlu> if I have a trusted LAN, it's good enough and there's no reason to make it more complicated
[10:03:28] <_xor> It's probably good practice to do it anyway going forward.
[10:03:36] <mlu> unless the cost of a compromise makes the PCI-DSS look lenient or somsething
[10:03:49] <mlu> it's only good practice if you have a threat model that justifies the cost of doing it

[10:06:18] <mlu> hehe, just make sure when someone asks why, the answer is a simple "why not?"
[10:06:21] <_xor> The cost for me to set it up isn't that big, so I'm going to do it eventually anyway. That's not my primary concern currently.
[10:06:34] * _xor sighs
[10:06:47] <mlu> primary concern is to make it manageable, right ?:D
[10:07:07] <mlu> now, client acceptance of client-side certs -- getting that socialized is a PITA
[10:07:23] <_xor> Ok, because I do have a decent amount of sensitive data, both PCI (some) and PHI (more). It doesn't travel over those channels...yet, but I anticipate that it probably will eventually.

[10:10:29] <_xor> The current thing I'm thinking about is if/how I'd go about balancing haproxy TLS + client certs that are auth'ed upstream.
[10:10:34] <mlu> speaking of which, I need to figure out a good credentials vault tool for personal use
[10:10:53] <_xor> Unfortunately, I know the issue there with regards to 0t.
[10:11:12] <mlu> _xor: the haproxy instances probably have to communicate tokens
[10:11:15] <_xor> I use vault for infrastructure and vaultwarden for clients.
[10:11:49] <mlu> way I usually see this: it's sufficient balancing to just be doing it at the per-client level instead of the per-connection level
[10:11:50] <_xor> Right, I'm pretty sure my only real option is forwarding via http headers. Not a big deal, but...I need to figure out how to configure that upstream then.

[17:24:39] <mlu> I often contemplate if I should start some ERC20 tokens for them just for the heck of it
[17:24:46] <pluri_> yes absolutely, value in general is purely a social construct, it needs consensus in order for it to exist
[17:25:05] <vitali64> 1920x800 is just not going to do
[17:25:08] <NthDegree> Intelo, a) the central server was to make their service work on iOS/Android, where the mainstream app stores block P2P apps.  b) Yes, essentially. c) Viewers donate coin from their viewing and other actions for free videos. But creators can also set a cost for watching for "premium" content.  d) LBRY has a blacklist file containing links which anyone can null out to bypass the filter, Odysee doesn't allow a bypass but LBRY does. But then they publish
[17:25:08] <NthDegree> the takedown requests with the links on GitHub so you know what they're for (https://github.com/lbryio/dmca/) e) There's no purely mining type of method to obtain coins which I am aware of.
[17:25:26] <goddard> you would think those two countries would be against the global centralization of the money system
[17:25:28] <pluri_> but the ERC20 standard doesn't interfere with that, it begins from the assumption that some value exists, and you want to represent it digitally, in a general and trustless, permissionless way
[17:25:39] <mlu> goddard: same reason why they'd restrict imports/exports of currency

[17:39:54] <goddard> and ubuntu
[17:40:05] <goddard> i just bought one with ubuntu 20.04
[17:40:22] <goddard> pangolin 15
[17:40:32] <goddard> all AMD laptop
[17:40:48] <libh> I'm aware of system76 and the like, but I was hoping to have one without an OS at all installed already or maybe even no drive at all. I guess ebay is my only choice.

[17:40:57] <NthDegree> Intelo, the person publishing the video seeds to some central servers, which then act as webseeds. Every viewer also acts as a seed by default, however, the more views (and/or coin) being created as a result of the content, the longer the central servers (used by Odysee) continue to seed the video.
[17:41:08] <mlu> libh: you might as well just buy a barebones system
[17:41:15] <goddard> libh: framework has that option
[17:41:16] *** Joins: ___nick___ (~quassel@cpc68286-cdif17-2-0-cust533.5-1.cable.virginm.net)
[17:41:21] <NthDegree> Intelo, if you use LBRY desktop, by default it downloads and keeps every video you watch, even if you don't watch the whole video
[17:41:22] <goddard> its small thouhg
[17:41:26] <goddard> only 13 inch
[17:41:50] <mlu> libh: at that point, you might as well just build it yourself: it's not really a functional system without an OS IMO
[17:42:02] <NthDegree> Intelo, and yes.. that does mean if you end up watching something disgusting/shocking, it hangs around unless you purge it yourself..
[17:42:15] <libh> I think something like newegg would be a good choice.
[17:42:38] <mlu> Amazon and Newegg are my two main sources for components
[17:42:48] <mlu> also my local computer store, Central Computers

[17:43:24] <mlu> I actually have had the need to have systems that act more as appliances instead of general computers that lack any sort of storage
[17:43:31] <libh> I'll just do a DIY build your own workstation and install my distro of choice rather than rely on prebuilt. Thanks.

[17:43:33] <mlu> and in those systems, I tend to netboot them
[17:43:37] <Intelo> NthDegree but how can a viewer viewing video in a  mere browser be able to seed? seeding needs some kind of app. no?
[17:43:52] <arcturus> just wipe the pre installed os
[17:43:57] <goddard> libh: i got a threadripper system ill sell ya

[17:44:31] <NthDegree> Intelo, that's why Odysee and LBRY aren't the same thing and why the whole thing doesn't work in reality. Odysee doesn't seed, it's like YouTube. LBRY is an app which seeds.  Odysee is popular but few people install the P2P client called LBRY
[17:44:47] <mlu> if someone asks me to build a system without an OS on it, I'll sell them one, but you can be quite sure I'd verify its functionality with a bootable distro on a USB stick :)
[17:44:47] <arcturus> prebuilt can be cheaper than buying parts if you intend to get a gpu

[17:45:40] <bmr> its disgusting that you're telling the truth, arcturus
[17:45:52] <Intelo> NthDegree so people that install the app called LBRY are the seeders?
[17:45:56] <bmr> it's insane
[17:46:23] <NthDegree> Intelo, yes, but Odysee users can't even leech from them.

[17:46:58] <Intelo> NthDegree why would anyone want to use the desktop app instead of browser? (also I am guessing that with LBRY app, you can view the banned videos by odysee)?
[17:47:54] <BSaboia> Is there a way to pipe the clipboard in the terminal?
[17:47:55] <NthDegree> Intelo, thats the million dollar question and why the whole thing does not work. Yes you can view banned videos if you also clear the blacklist file which LBRY downloads... or you can use the blacklist file as a way to shop for banned content (lol, the irony)

[17:49:46] <NthDegree> Intelo, well, the desktop app allows you to immediately keep what you watch, unlike the website. It also allows you to watch stuff which is no longer on Odysee servers (even if it's not banned, unpopular content gets purged regularly)

[17:51:07] <Intelo> NthDegree and you become a seed by default as well (whether you like it or not)? Correct/
[17:51:27] <NthDegree> Yes by default you're a seed, though you can reconfigure it to turn it off, or just firewall your way out of it
[17:51:43] <NthDegree> when you first install it, you can go to the settings and disable seeding
[17:51:51] <goddard> but if you have a NAS or even an external drive that has like 14 or 16TB for 200 - 300 bucks you could store a TON of videos

I guess the practice is that to provide the API, you'd need the old library (best in a chroot, though there are guides for non-chrooted installation of ancient stuff like Netscape 4), and the old library may depend on something removed from, say, the kernel. Or virtually incompatible with a modern system.

[23:57:29] <CoJaBo> I did LFS as a group project in college
[23:57:34] <CoJaBo> One guy had fun
[23:58:02] <omegatron> yeah and I do it quite often
[23:58:09] <omegatron> but this time ... *sigh*

[23:58:11] <F8ER> rbox, look, I relatively understand the handiness of magnificent IRC. Either it's modern, or conservative, it definitely allows advanced communicatiion. However, some media features sometimes lack, and other options like Discord may significantly help. IRC is open source, Discord is not though (especially back-end), but utilizes a lot of FOSS projects: https://discord.com/licenses
[23:58:19] <rbox> F8ER: are you still on about this garbage?
[23:58:26] <Dan39> omegatron: add rootwait to the kernel args and see if that helps

[23:58:42] <omegatron> hm, can try it ..
[23:58:43] <F8ER> I mean, imho all options are allowed to live and develop. It's evolution, so... why not? ^^

[23:59:31] <rwx0644> omegatron: are you booting with or without initrd?
[23:59:33] <F8ER> Discord got some good options from IRC, IRC may add some options from other projects too. It's global collaboration of communication options.
[23:59:35] <Elw3> Ive literally unfriended someone because he insisted to write a discord link on his wedding invite.
[23:59:37] <omegatron> without
[23:59:51] <Dan39> omegatron: just try rootwait :)
[23:59:53] <omegatron> (as always)
[23:59:56] <rwx0644> omegatron: using an initrd might help debugging the boot process
