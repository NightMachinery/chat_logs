[17:21:20] <JyZyXy> i suppose developers have access to high memory systems allowing them to work on trading memory for security
[17:22:07] *** Joins: martinus__ (~martin@2.56.202.77.rev.sfr.net)
[17:30:16] <dalias> it would be so nice if the engineering effort had been into making this a security improvement *without* 1000% resource overhead
[17:31:51] <JyZyXy> perhaps the justification is that higher memory will eventually become more common and easily accessible to everyone
[17:34:18] <JyZyXy> and at some level it's probably not being viewed too badly to drive up the demand for higher memory
[17:34:55] <JyZyXy> (the people who finance the corporations paying wages for developers to make these features)
[17:34:59] <dalias> i think the justification is that management would rather spend 75% of their engineering resources on massively overengineered data stores for cloud bookmarks and partnerships with scammy third-party services they get VC money from
[17:35:22] <dalias> and designing something that's secure and efficient is hard and doesn't work when the team is underfunded
[17:35:29] <ede> did you notice the inflation in turkey over the last weeks in special, but generally over the last years?
[17:35:47] <ede> which means everything imported becomes insanely expensive
[17:36:44] <ede> also how did a midpriced PC's RAM change for the last 10 or 15 years?
[17:37:15] <ede> i started with 2GB in 2003, after going from 4MB to 512 over the 90s
[17:37:19] <JyZyXy> why make big improvements when you can slowly milk the customers with small incremental improvements - Intel
[17:37:20] <dalias> reasonably priced pc's don't have upgradable ram and it's still at 2-4 GB, soldered on the motherboard
[17:37:54] <dalias> the difference is literally like $180-250 vs $650+
[17:38:30] <ede> i mentioned a comment a few times already on freenode/libera of a dev i've seen in some help forum (maybe GH even), who said his PC only[sic!] having 32GB
[17:38:50] <ede> over autumn someone said something similar here too
[17:39:01] <dalias> for something 10x more powerful than what sufficed for browsing and even gaming in 2005 but non-upgradable, vs something *minimally* upgradable
[17:39:27] <dalias> these people are on crack and so out of touch with the real world
[17:39:37] <ede> soldered? didn't see this in the 90s even, not since DIMM aren't a thing anymore
[17:39:43] <dalias> yes
[17:40:04] <JyZyXy> i've seen and heard it with my own eyes how wealthy people in power view these devices as throw away things that are re-purchased annually
[17:40:24] <ede> i check my default PC shop from time to time, 4-8GB seems pretty normal unless you go for dev or games
[17:40:28] <dalias> if you're buying a PC for more $$$ than a high-end PC cost in 1990, you're completely missing the point of advancement
[17:41:09] <dalias> yeah, 4-8 is pretty normal for the baseline stuff you can find easily for well under $1000
[17:41:26] <ede> checked this one then https://10toptest.de/vergleich/beste-gaming-pcs/
[17:41:37] <ede> forget all the text, just look at price and ram
[17:42:23] <dalias> ah i'm assuming laptops. i forget desktop dinosaurs are even a thing anymore
[17:43:39] <ede> 8 GB for #4, and... can't find a price. amazon really sucks.
[17:44:12] <ede> dalias: because of what you just mentioned i'd never use a laptop as main machine
[17:44:28] <ede> also keyboard sucks, mini display
[17:45:02] <ede> you get less for much more, the only pro is the size, but that's it.
[17:45:34] <ede> had to replace the graphics card after some years here, how do you do this on a laptop? or just add some more ram.
[17:45:47] <dalias> well if you're using non-laptop i'd use something like a nuc or mini-itx, not these silly 1990s-era towers :)
[17:46:03] <ede> tha's #3 https://www.amazon.de/dp/B01878ZPIS?tag=10topbutt-21&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1
[17:46:17] <ede> €3300, the right machine for Joe Average
[17:46:22] <dalias> lol
[17:46:40] <dalias> that's about 20x the price average user should expect to pay
[17:46:58] <mannequin> there is that channel "lgr" on youtube
[17:47:12] <ede> can't say what format the board has, but the GPU fan blocks one of 2 PCI slots. really great design.
[17:47:20] <mannequin> the guy reviews all kinds of stuff from the previous era on there
[17:47:20] <dalias> :-p
[17:47:47] <ede> i think i paid around 600€ for this one in uhm, 2008.
[17:48:07] <mannequin> ultimatly it comes to building some old pc and running dn3d
[17:48:08] <ede> would be (technically) 1600DM, and that's about what i also paid during the 90s
[17:48:57] <ede> including a 14”CRT. and later 17“ with the one next to y2k.
[17:49:41] <ede> fun fact: i kept a 2nd browser instance open on THIS machine less than a decade ago with a dozen fb tabs and a flash game.
[17:49:50] <mannequin> but really, if you want brining up horror stories check lgr instead
[17:50:08] <ede> now i only have to look around on twitter a bit and 1 or 2 other typical sites and my RAM is gone.
[17:50:45] <dalias> to be fair, a large part of the problem is the sites too
[17:50:52] <ede> yep
[17:51:08] <ede> people making them these days shouldn't be called developers or programmers
[17:51:11] <dalias> the advent of react and similar application frameworks ruined the web
[17:51:11] <mannequin> well modern technologies use many more reserouces
[17:51:33] <mannequin> flash sucked but was much lighter that what we got now
[17:51:35] <ede> incompetent web designers in the first place
[17:51:55] <ede> you remember this castle game when Canvas became a thing?
[17:52:04] <dalias> by getting rid of the efficient use of the DOM and instead making giant in-js-memory data models that get rendered into DOM client-side
[17:52:08] <ede> something doom like, but just in JS
[17:52:32] <ede> didn't run perfectly on low settings here, but it did. somehow.
[17:52:45] <ede> yeah, crap like proprietary tags
[17:54:04] <ede> <ytd-app><ytd-masthead>
[17:54:50] <ede> now how does firefox handle such a thing?

[18:02:35] <ede> the amount of css for that element is just insane. and most of it --yt[d] or --paper, everything proprietary.
[18:06:15] <dalias> but someone incompetent at google got a promotion for replacing the old clean site with that, so who can say if it's good or bad?
[18:15:08] <ede> when they removed the old version completely they forced me into youtube-dl ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

[21:52:52] <susi> important in what way? the new profile should already have those important files
[21:55:03] <xx> the various user prefs
[21:55:07] <susi> of course reinstall addons too, and if you have user.js or user{Chrome,Content}.css, those too
[21:55:43] <susi> I wouldn't recommend copying prefs.js but keeping user.js for custom prefs

[22:18:06] <patty> I've got to boot to the old drive. It's my parents' Christmas present (Mint 20 machine). My dad's Chrome profile seems to have come across all right, but I'm missing a pass. Is there some extension I can install in the old FF that will let me dump out something the new FF can import?
[22:18:24] <patty> While I'm fixing the Chrome thing ^^

[22:50:12] <susi> it usually works even though it's not recommended and may break stuff
[22:51:38] <susi> though support.mozilla.org seems to recommend just copying the whole folder
[22:54:01] <susi> after copying the whole mozilla profile to another one, remove addonStartup.json.lz4 from the root directory and restart Firefox twice
[22:59:33] <dalias> do i even want to know why that step is needed? :-p
