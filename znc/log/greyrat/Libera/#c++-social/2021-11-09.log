[01:08:48] <Bakunin> NGLIten, on the other hand, is described as an "anonymous cross-platform remote control program based on blockchain technology." It leverages New Kind of Network (NKN) infrastructure for its command-and-control (C2) communications in order to remain anonymous. NKN is used legitimately for many reasons, but rarely as a C2 channel.
[01:08:56] <Bakunin> I knew this blockchain shit would be cancer
