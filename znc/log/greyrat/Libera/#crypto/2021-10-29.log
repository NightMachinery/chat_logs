[00:23:04] <mike18> hi
[00:23:05] <mike18> how can i check if a ca certificate is still valid?
[00:23:12] <mike18> i have a   ca.crt and token
[00:24:31] <sarnold> openssl x509 -text .... is a starting point to finding out if the certificate you've got is still within its validity period
[00:24:50] <sarnold> whether or not that certificate is still valid with respect to any given certificate store is another question
[00:26:36] <mike18> text starts with -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- ?
[00:29:20] <sarnold> the -text is a command line option that asks the x509 tool to emit something human-readable, ish
[00:29:49] <mike18> how to convert BEGIN CERTIFICATE- .... into human readable?
[00:30:02] <Wulf> openssl x509 -text
[00:32:59] <mike18> not sure
[00:33:38] <mike18> openssl x509 -in certificate.crt -text -noout ?
[00:34:00] <mike18> unable to load certificate
[00:34:25] <mike18> 4444894828:error:09FFF066:PEM routines:CRYPTO_internal:bad end line:/....Sources/libressl/libressl-22.260.1/libressl-2.6/crypto/pem/pem_lib.c:791:
[00:35:03] <sarnold> I wonder if it's missing a newline at the very end of the file
[00:35:27] <mike18> oh
[00:35:28] <sarnold> that's a common problem, some editors / tools require those, and some editors / tools don't put them there :)
[00:35:45] <mike18> i added new line
[00:35:49] <mike18> but still same
[00:36:10] <mike18> does it need a pem file?
[00:38:03] <sarnold> the -inform option controls if it takes pem or der
[00:38:33] <mike18> oh
[00:38:40] <mike18> maybe remove -inform?
[00:38:57] <mike18> i dont have inform btw
[00:39:08] <mike18> der?
[00:39:17] <sarnold> try adding -inform pem    and -inform der  and see if either one gives different results?
[00:39:32] <Peng> aren't DER files binary?
[00:39:54] <mike18> i dont have a pem file
[00:40:03] <mike18> i have a token - not sure what thats good for
[00:40:31] <Peng> What's a token?
[00:41:03] <mike18> idk
[00:41:43] <Peng> Didn't you say ca.crt was a PEM format file?
[00:42:41] <mike18> https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/1.10.15/security.html#ssl
[00:42:46] <mike18> should be that here

[21:31:28] <riv> to be fair
[21:33:24] <MacGyver> Damn right it was; I used it until last year to teach my students about what happens if you mess up cert verification.
[21:33:32] <MacGyver> (Switched to mitmproxy now)
[21:37:22] <hendursaga> MacGyver: they're only demonstrated their ignorance
[21:39:14] <ericonr> MacGyver: speaking of sslstrip, do you know where, if anywhere, the project homepage is currently hosted?
[21:39:20] <ericonr> the one linked in wikipedia is gone :/
[21:39:27] <riv> sslstrip is fixed btw
[21:39:41] <MacGyver> ericonr: Iirc it's gone but you can still find it with some effort.
[21:39:51] <MacGyver> ericonr: The main issue is it was never ported to Python 3 :P
[21:39:54] <ericonr> hehe
[21:40:02] <ericonr> wikipedia lists an archived version fwiw
[21:40:29] <riv> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lwbHYOFD-4 btw, may not be the biggest fan of moxie but this little documentary of a boat trip was lovely
[21:40:31] <ericonr> would just be nice if accessing a current version were possible
[21:40:42] <ericonr> hm
[21:40:45] <ericonr> or maybe not
[21:40:47] <ericonr> https://web.archive.org/web/20180620042059/https://moxie.org/software/sslstrip/index.html wtf
[21:41:05] <ericonr> > This URL has been excluded from the Wayback Machine.
[21:41:57] <MacGyver> ericonr: It's still on pypi.
