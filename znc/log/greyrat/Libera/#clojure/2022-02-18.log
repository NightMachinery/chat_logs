[02:18:31] <technomancy> shem: racket is much easier to build a type system for because A) it has no nils and B) it really really wants you to use structs where the data shapes are declared at compile time instead of clojure maps that are free-form with zero guarantees.
[02:18:55] <technomancy> clojure's behavior around nil is exactly what you would design if you were specifically trying to go out of your way and be type-system-hostile
[02:19:19] <technomancy> nil has like four or five distinct meanings in clojure that all get collapsed into one value

[17:03:07] <yeik-the-spik[m]> Is anyone familiar with something along the lines of "the factory method for functional programmers"? Were that anyone to exist, could such a resource be shared?
[17:03:54] <Para> yeik-the-spik[m]: http://mishadoff.com/blog/clojure-design-patterns/ and "episode 18. factory method"
[17:04:30] <yeik-the-spik[m]> Yet again I've been gone overboard with the use of passive tenses.
[17:04:49] <yeik-the-spik[m]> Para: truly appreciated!
[17:04:59] <Para> records have the convention of generating a ->RecordName function, that's effectively a factory method
[17:05:50] <yeik-the-spik[m]> It's not that I want to use a factory method. I want to understand some code that uses such method
[17:06:38] <yeik-the-spik[m]> But I am lacking at OOP and Java, and most tutorials go that route, so I am a bit lost
[17:07:07] *** Joins: Inoperable (~PLAYER_1@fancydata.science)
[17:07:31] <Para> In object based languages it's helpful to have explicit instantiation in one place only and have every other place requiring an instance call that particular spot; you can implement object caches, flyweights etc. that way quite easily.
[17:08:20] <wink> oh wow thanks, nice link
[17:13:41] <yeik-the-spik[m]> I think I understand the concept of instantiation. It took me a while since most stuff I've instantiated in Python were rather superfluous, and I was always wondering "what's the point?"
[17:14:13] <yeik-the-spik[m]> I think I am beginning to grasp the difference between an object and a class
[17:14:31] <yeik-the-spik[m]> I think I need to read that blog from the top, can't go straight to episode 18
[17:14:54] <Para> class is the blueprint of a house, object instance is an actual building
[17:15:14] <Para> Of course metaphors break immediately, as same instance can be used in multiple places and such quantum homes don't exist.
[17:15:37] <Para> And contrary to popular confusion, classes are not types :)

[17:17:19] <yeik-the-spik[m]> Para: Well, that's the intuition I had
[17:17:52] <Para> There are some similarities and simple types can be simulated with classes and polymorphism, but it gets muddy.
[17:17:55] <yeik-the-spik[m]> Para: Dear neighbor, do you have some time to talk about the multiverse xP
[17:19:05] <yeik-the-spik[m]> Yeah, the whole class not type. I do not have that clear at all. I think understand types.
[17:20:44] <yeik-the-spik[m]> I mean, I have a working knowledge of all that stuff, I've implemented classes and whatnot, but it kinda feels esoteric to me.
[17:21:29] <yeik-the-spik[m]> Like, why not just write functions and maps / records and work with that?

[17:35:45] <yeik-the-spik[m]> <ridcully_> "oop is a phase in humankind..." <- I hope you are right. But what about all the OOP legacy code? How would we get over it?
[17:36:44] <yeik-the-spik[m]> agents, yet another thing I am definitely not grasping. I have some stuff using aleph. That's kinda agents stuff, right? 
[17:37:19] <ridcully_> never.  it will stay forever and old folks will have to be un-retired and get s++ hourly rates for it.  just like cobol
[17:38:40] <Para> yeik-the-spik[m]: agent is, when really dumbed down, "something that does something", eg. a function could very well be an agent
[17:39:06] <Para> The original idea of OOP is having agents doing processing of messages, and these messages are routed to correct agents based on identities.
[17:39:37] <yeik-the-spik[m]> Just what I was thinking about legacy code. That's the only bright spot I seen on learning all these painful things.
[17:40:06] <Para> So, a function posting a data structure to core async channel to which a few others are bound as listeners, which then do their own processing and further message passing is OOP...
[17:40:39] <yeik-the-spik[m]> Para: Oh, ok. The routing based on identity is the main difference from just composing functions. Right?
[17:40:50] <Para> Yeah, they're decoupled.
[17:41:07] <Para> "Someone who can handle BUY-MORE-TOILETPAPER, please process this!"
[17:42:20] <Para> That is, a good push based data processing graph is really just a pure OOP system.
[17:42:39] <Para> People just don't want to think it with those terms, and who can blame them :)
[17:46:48] <yeik-the-spik[m]> Well, truly grateful for the handed knowledge.
[17:48:54] <yeik-the-spik[m]> <Para> "People just don't want to..." <- Yeah, I feel like there is a divide between people that are (untrue-)OOP practitioners and me. I was once examined on my knowledge of programming with the question "what is a class"

[20:03:24] <technomancy[m]> imo the whole term "OOP" is a lost cause
[20:03:59] <technomancy[m]> you can argue about Alan Kay all you want but people are going to use the word to mean Java and C++ whether you like it or not
[20:04:27] <technomancy[m]> so it's better to use specific terms like actors, polymorphism, inheritance, etc
[20:04:56] <seebs> aww, someone already had my idea
[20:04:57] <seebs> http://mishadoff.com/blog/clojure-design-patterns/
[20:05:14] <ridcully_> so the theory got ran over by practise... like "agile" is burned...
[20:05:49] <seebs> have been at two places that were using agile
[20:05:53] <seebs> it was good once
[20:06:06] <ridcully_> "so it's all just functions?"  "it always was *click*"
[20:06:51] <seebs> i do have fond memories of the Agile Consultants, and by "fond memories" i mean i'm glad they're just memories and not part of my world anymore
[20:07:37] <seebs> so, the idea they had was, require every task to have estimates of hours, and then every day at standup, go over the freshly-updated estimates of time remaining, and time spent, so that if it looked like we weren't on track to finish our sprint commitment items, we could move things out into next sprint
[20:08:22] <seebs> that way, instead of spending two weeks focused on doing work and replanning every two weeks, so the cost of being wrong is mitigated but you don't spend a lot of time constantly messing about with the plan, you can have at least five hours a week of billable time for agile consultants facilitating these meetings

[20:14:34] <TimMc> It can be nice if people aren't cargo culting it and actually introspect on the process at all, yeah.
[20:14:54] <TimMc> (and also understand that planning is not the opposite of agile)

[21:44:37] <tatsumaru> Sorry I just read your previous comments. It's always a red flag when they are quizzing you rather than wanting to see how you think.
[21:44:58] <seebs> on the topic of the security agent thing: i'm told that one of the most famously stupid scenes in NCIS (two people typing on the same keyboard so they could hack faster) was in fact intended as a joke by the participants
[21:45:04] <sobel> this place was just a fractal of red flags
[21:45:13] <tatsumaru> Hey what year was John McCarthy born?
[21:45:16] <seebs> i used php once
[21:45:56] <seebs> because i wanted to use perl, but the company making the Custom Database Engine had a perl module which only worked with one specific third-party version of perl, but they didn't understand this, and they claimed it was a "MacOS linker error" that got unresolved symbols when their code requested symbols not present in the system's default perl
[21:45:56] <Para> I had to do some PHP courses back in school to get some extra credits and the teacher I had was adamant PHP is an OO language.
[21:46:27] <seebs> so anyway, i asked the people with the database how to escape quotes and things with their SQL engine. no, they did not have prepare/bind.
[21:46:30] <sobel> one can make that argument, but it's always going to be an argument
[21:46:33] <seebs> and they told me they thought it was probably backslashes.
[21:46:54] <sobel> ouch
[21:46:56] <seebs> so anyway that was me trying to work with a database whose vendor had an optimistic hope that they knew how to escape things in their database engine
[21:47:05] <tatsumaru> seebs: that was a cover up story, it was indeed a distributed typing technology created by Siamese twin agents back in the cold war and later adopted by agents to maximize the throughput of crating GUIs in visual basic for tracing IPs.
[21:47:34] <seebs> the schema was designed by contractors prior to my involvement, and i can summarize their design with what they told me about it: "all fields are varchar for simplicity".
[21:47:59] <seebs> this is the worst part about trying to write brilliantly bad code. you can spend hours trying to think of something stupid and some random idiot can just walk along and make it worse.
[21:48:21] <sobel> i have some rather disturbing SQL generation code but it goes to the trouble of preparing the parameters at the same time as the query, which it then prepares and executes with parameters, because i care about my g.d. data!

[21:56:44] <Para> I'm still waiting for my moment to use the "Thank you all for coming, you must wonder why I have gathered you here." line when stepping into an elevator.
[21:56:45] <sobel> i like my A a little closer to 435

[21:58:06] <tatsumaru> It would be cool to say that at one's own wedding
[21:58:39] <sobel> guests at my wedding would definitely already be wondering
[21:59:03] <sobel> "what's the big idea, here?"
[21:59:17] <TimMc> My preferred elevator pitch is 0°.
[21:59:37] <TimMc> anything beyond maybe 3° is kind of alarming tbh
[22:00:04] <ridcully_> i'd say, that would be sloped
[22:00:17] <tatsumaru> TimMc do you have a variable elevator pitch?
[22:00:22] <Para> Depends also on the motion vector of the elevator as well.
[22:00:38] <TimMc> (I'm not very fond of elevator yaw or roll either)
[22:03:14] <Para> Somehow my mind wandered to form a question "how many holes does an elevator have?"
[22:03:52] <tatsumaru> I remember having a similar debate with my cousins when I was 5, but it wasn't about elevators

[22:59:48] <tatsumaru> Is this some kind of a gyro-elevator?
[23:00:53] <Para> I was thinking more like a halved donut with two cabins, the sides are mainly ornamental with some joining structure.

[23:02:39] <sobel> couldn't the donut halves spin in opposite directions, canceling out the gyroscope effects?
[23:02:44] <tatsumaru> Para: make sure people are only allowed to eat donuts in the elevator
[23:03:14] <Para> Or maybe along the donut's own shape? As in sectors spinning along the i-don't-know-what-it's-called.

[23:03:34] <Para> Not axis, I mean alongside the ring itself but parallel to it.
[23:03:38] <sobel> aha
[23:04:37] <sobel> i like this elevator more and more
[23:05:06] <sobel> let's get it going as fast as we can and drop it down the elevator shaft. bring hearing protection.

[23:05:40] <sobel> (why test something if not destructively)
[23:05:58] <Para> Percussive maintenance is a thing, why not percussive testing then as well.
[23:05:59] <tatsumaru> this doesn't sound fun for the elevatees
[23:06:52] <Para> I'm still amused by the fact that collective noun for employees is staff. In hindsight it's super obvious.
[23:07:20] <tatsumaru> isn't employees a collective noun?
[23:07:26] <sobel> it's justa plural noun
[23:07:50] <seebs> the question of whether a given thing has a collective noun is often debatable if it isn't a thing british aristocrats hunted
[23:08:07] <seebs> ... in retrospect, saying it out loud, that implies there probably is one for "employees"
[23:08:11] <sobel> i coalesce missing collective nouns to 'gaggle'
[23:08:15] <sobel> missing, unknown
[23:08:25] <Para> seebs: it is literally staff :)
[23:08:51] <sobel> i still call mine "staffers"
[23:09:14] <sobel> staffers do the staffing, so...
[23:09:18] <seebs> and the collective bargaining noun for employees is union
[23:09:24] <sobel> hehe, nice
[23:09:50] <sobel> the collective noun for management is error
[23:09:54] <TimMc> "a staff of employees" hmmm
[23:09:58] <Para> Better remember that, I bet some good ol' British chap would get a laugh from that.
[23:10:09] <sobel> "a staff comprising 3 employees"
[23:10:30] <sobel> oh i prolly got that one wrong again
[23:10:34] <TimMc> "I had to dodge a staff of employees exiting the burrito joint"
[23:10:39] <seebs> huh. for cats, "clowder" or "clutter" that seems fair
[23:10:49] <seebs> see also two ravens being arrested for attempted murder

[23:11:56] <sobel> (in reality, my employee was armed with commit privileges :( :( :( )
[23:12:08] <Para> Someone suggested a group of programmers should be called a merge conflict.
[23:12:20] <seebs> hmm
[23:12:25] <sobel> or a repo
[23:12:41] <sobel> internal vs external facing views perhaps
[23:12:52] <Para> What do you call a pair of crows? An attempted murder.
[23:13:00] <sobel> double murder?
[23:13:19] <sobel> no wait, that would be two groups of separate species of crow
[23:14:57] <tatsumaru> I now want to watch "The Crow" again
[23:17:28] <Para> OK I am childish but "nosegay of flowers" :D Considering of course the age of these terms, that's from the era when it meant happy.
[23:18:25] <tatsumaru> Noone's naming their kid Gaylord anymore either
[23:18:34] <seebs> one of my friends released some code under a license which i post here in its entirety: "Be gay. Do crimes."
[23:19:39] <Para> True story, back when I used to play Ultima Online I played on an RP shard which was quite serious. I was a sort of thief/mage whatever, so part of my schtick was using the incognito spell which in game would change my name for a few minutes. Worked well in RP setting, until one day it decided to name me "Gaylord Moonlord".
[23:19:56] <seebs> which, obviously, everyone knew immediately was you
[23:20:16] <Para> Yes, we had to do quite a lot of rules policing because UO isn't exactly immersive :)
[23:20:39] <Para> There was an IRC channel on the side and basically the whole shard went "lol TP to Trinsic bank"
[23:21:04] <Para> Ahhh, late 90's/early 00's...
[23:21:14] <tatsumaru> isn't it weird that IRC is still alive and hasn't changed
[23:21:22] <tatsumaru> after what 30 years
[23:21:35] <seebs> a little over
[23:21:43] <technomancy> I think the last RFC for it came out in 2000
[23:21:45] <seebs> i think i first used irc in... probably '89 or '90, just guessing?
[23:21:52] <Para> '89 IIRC
[23:21:59] <Para> And of course made by a Finn.
[23:22:02] <technomancy> but it might have been standardizing existing behavior rather than actually changing anything
[23:22:06] <seebs> internet says theoretically 1988
[23:22:16] <seebs> i was using it before named channels
[23:22:24] <seebs> named channels were DEFINITELY a good idea
[23:22:42] <Para> The school most of these things originate, TKK, is still under quite a reputation. It's basically student village on a peninsula for hard core nerding subjects.
[23:23:13] <seebs> definitely a good example of how much early internet tech tended to lack even a vague concept of what a security consideration would look like
[23:23:31] <Para> Public transport outside working hours has always been shoddy there and cars aren't really a thing for students so what else to do than to brew some sugarwine and hack Linux :)
[23:24:42] <seebs> so is there a good way to do stuff like rendering images, etc., from clojure without having to actually interact with swing?
[23:25:02] <seebs> like, imagine for the sake of argument that i once used swing and i'm okay leaving it at "once"
[23:25:06] <tatsumaru> seebs: no offtopic in this channel please
[23:25:16] <seebs> heh
[23:25:50] <seebs> is this like the thing where if you're in an MMO and you want to mention that you have goods for sale, you should do it in the "politics-and-religion" channel, so named because those are the topics discussed in the channel labeled "trade"?
[23:27:26] <tatsumaru> sorry my joke kind of moved your genuine question out of focus
[23:27:35] <Para> http://quil.info/
[23:27:58] <Para> We use that at ClojureBridge as a sort of graphics toy to teach basics of Clojure to newcomers.
[23:28:14] <Para> Well, used to do that. Thanks, global state of everything.
[23:28:25] <seebs> oh, hey. i found that and it looked interesting, but i wasn't sure whether it was live/etc
[23:29:30] <Para> Anything involving pixels is kinda hard on anything JVM, though.
[23:30:13] <seebs> there's a fire sketch that says "evaluated with warnings"
[23:30:27] <seebs> which says something about "Cannot infer target type in expression"
[23:30:37] <Para> although if you're going to do Swing, I'd say start by looking at https://github.com/kirill-grouchnikov/radiance
[23:30:49] <Para> At least by taking that your Swing UI won't look like donkey's ass.
[23:31:22] <seebs> is (vector x y) different from [x y]
[23:31:31] <seebs> i mean, i'd prefer not to do swing

[23:36:55] <Para> It's map destructuring, but should only have one vector.
[23:37:06] <Para> and :as particle is just a symbol alias for the whole map
[23:37:22] <seebs> ohh, hmm. [x y] :location is destructuring the location vec into individual x and y i guess

[23:37:46] <Para> Nesting destructurings :D
[23:38:05] <seebs> ohh, i think i'm following. ":keys [lifespan]" is probably extracting :lifespan as a local named lifespan, and [x y] :location is extracting-and-destructuring location into x and y
[23:38:23] <seebs> and the name ":as particle" isn't actually used at all i think
[23:38:44] <seebs> yeah, i can just take that out and nothing changes
[23:39:18] <Para> From what I've seen, people tend to do the `:as something` as a convention.
[23:39:23] <Para> It goes unused quite often.
