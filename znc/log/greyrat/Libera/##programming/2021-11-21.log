[00:04:34] <apotheon> difficult to keep up with different capitalizations

[00:04:59] <apotheon> vdamewood: How so?
[00:05:00] <flakland> except now they lie and pretend its "open source" DRM
[00:05:05] <vdamewood> Pirates would often rob cargo ships and leave crew and passenger's personal belongings alone.
[00:05:06] <apotheon> . . . because it lacks a ship?
[00:05:14] <vdamewood> passengers'
[00:05:24] <apotheon> Maybe that was a cargo vessel that got robbed in the pic.
[00:05:52] <apotheon> How do you know?
[00:05:58] <vdamewood> apotheon: Well, there's also the person getting shot. Pirates often avoided shooting crew for reputation purposes.

[04:04:51] <kveroneau> Then in dosbox.conf set midiconfig=128:0
[04:05:32] <kveroneau> And when you set the driver in a support DOS game to use MPU401, it will output via timidity, and use the soundfont you selected.
[04:05:50] <kveroneau> Really brings a lot of retro DOS games to life imo
[04:06:09] <kveroneau> And of course it will work in Windows 3.1x within DOSBox for those games as well.

[04:43:41] <DarkTrick> So I was searching for an alternative (Qt is actually none, because not FOSS)

[04:48:12] <kveroneau> Ah, okay, I get that now.  I've never written a program that had an issue like that, I can't say.  But I do see where you're coming from.  It is confusing to know which is in focus.

[04:48:42] <CalimeroTeknik> I wish they stopped incrementing GTK and Qt versions
[04:48:50] <DarkTrick> And this problem is not and will never be addressed on Gtk ~3
[04:48:50] <CalimeroTeknik> I don't even have a Qt5 theme yet
[04:48:59] <kveroneau> Just like how there will never be a macOS 11 or XI?
[04:49:02] <InPhase> DarkTrick: I recently found myself engaged in the same search.  The most interesting idea I came across was Dear ImGui.
[04:49:20] <CalimeroTeknik> much less a GTK3.24 theme
[04:49:22] <kveroneau> Microsoft originally told the world that Windows 10 was the last version of Windows, and look where that brought us.
[04:49:36] <InPhase> DarkTrick: I want to set aside some upcoming time to try exploring the potential of Dear ImGui as a more general purpose UI tool.
[04:49:38] <DarkTrick> kveroneau, yeh win 11 announce was hillarious :D

[04:50:06] <kveroneau> A company should never ever say this is out last version of something.
[04:50:38] <kveroneau> I've always liked the naming for the XBox One :D
[04:50:39] <kzootech> kveroneau: well windows 10 will be the last version of windows 10
[04:50:49] <kveroneau> And I thought I was bad at naming stuff.
[04:51:30] <DarkTrick> I'm not sure if ImGui is an alternative for now, though
[04:51:52] <vdamewood> kveroneau: Did they really make the claim that there will never be a macOS 11?
[04:52:18] <kveroneau> vdamewood, I don't think they ever did, which is why I am still awaiting macOS 11 :D
[04:52:30] <kveroneau> Powered by Linux ontop of Windows 20
[04:52:43] <vdamewood> kveroneau: macOS 12 was released last month.
[04:52:43] <InPhase> vdamewood: Well yes, but it MacOS 11 came out a year ago.
[04:52:51] <InPhase> And 12, yeah.
[04:53:01] <vdamewood> I'm using macOS 11 right now.
[04:53:02] <kveroneau> Isn't it 10.12
[04:53:23] <InPhase> They realized it was nonsense.  They were up to 10.15 and there were already piles of version incompatibilities past the decimal point.
[04:53:26] <kveroneau> Or did they officially change it from X/10 to 11 and now 12?
[04:53:27] <vdamewood> No, that was released years ago. 10.15 was the last 10.x
[04:53:37] <InPhase> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS_version_history#Releases
[04:53:37] <bayaz> Title: macOS version history - Wikipedia 
[04:54:01] <kveroneau> At least Debian kept it's version numbers sane.
[04:54:04] <vdamewood> macOS 10.12 was released in 2016.
[04:54:40] <InPhase> This is why I like date-based version numbers.
[04:54:50] <kveroneau> Of Ubuntu?
[04:54:56] <vdamewood> They droped the 'OS X' bbranding years ago too.
[04:55:10] <DarkTrick> InPhase, yes! I really like that too
[04:55:16] <InPhase> Semantic version numbers offer a pretense of some stability, but the lines can be pretty arbitrary on what stays stable.
[04:55:18] <zero> InPhase: 202111210125 format
[04:55:19] <DarkTrick> I just hope they will drop the names 
[04:55:20] * kveroneau loved the OS X branding.
[04:55:47] <kveroneau> SaltStack actually moved away from date-based to now something different.
[04:55:47] <vdamewood> Well, they eventually had to get rid of it so they could increment the major version number.
[04:56:07] <InPhase> zero: 2021.11.21.01.25 or with dashes and/or underscores or something.  But yes.
[04:56:08] <vdamewood> InPhase: Well, the lines are pretty strict according to the semver spec.

[05:04:00] <InPhase> zero: Although I can't think of a case of it being done, a decent approach to date based versioning with branches would be to prepend any non-main branch to the version.
[05:04:11] <kveroneau> And those seperate components will be versioned themselves.

[05:53:18] <Thedarkb> I somehow went from writing stuff that controls UPSs and sent temperature reports to doing database front ends and logistics...
[05:53:18] <arahael> OOP tries to do a lot of data hiding, whereas functional is more like, not doing data hiding at all - relies on different techniques instead.
[05:54:27] <Thedarkb> I have noticed that my programming is getting gradually more and more functional the more I write.
[05:54:47] <Thedarkb> My latest project has almost no globally mutable state.
[05:56:08] <apotheon> Thedarkb: nice, you're levelling up
[05:56:41] <beaky> next milestone no locally mutable state
[05:56:53] <Thedarkb> Don't think I'm ever getting there.
[05:57:23] <Thedarkb> I remember looking into whether FORTH had local variables and Chuck Moore's opinion was that if you need locals, you haven't thought your program through.
[05:58:22] <beaky> see chuck moore had a point its why pointless style is usefull in lagnuages that support it if yotu dont have lcoal variables you get to be more expressive by only needing to state the operations and not the variables at all
[05:58:34] <beaky> and thus compose operations directly
[05:58:46] <arahael> Yeah, you probably don't need *mutable* local variables for the most part.

[05:59:36] <Thedarkb> I don't think on a level where I can understand how to work without locals.
[06:00:17] <arahael> I'm saying that local lets make sense.
[06:00:25] <arahael> But local vars?  Not that neccessary, imho.
[06:01:21] <beaky> yes you only need local variables to do the equivalent of clone, swap, and dup in non concatenative langauges
[06:02:43] <Thedarkb> I don't think I could ever do my game dev side stuff functionally.
[06:02:53] <Thedarkb> There's just too much state involved.

[06:05:17] <arahael> In theory you can just mutate the whole state each time.
[06:05:17] <beaky> but if you get to compose the operations directly you dont need them for example if in lisp you'd do (lambda (x) (+ (* x x) (* x x))) you can do dup mul dup add instead (or in haskell you can do (+) .: (*) i think in other words you have to reinvent those operations)
[06:05:37] <beaky> yes just have a giant purely functional struct that you update every frame
[06:06:09] <beaky> struct of arrays so you do entity component architecture
[06:06:09] <arahael> And that's not as expensive as it sounds in languages that support that paradigm.

[07:32:04] <oldlaptop> zero: Usually, that refers to a program that is linked "statically" against the libraries it uses, as opposed to "dynamically". Statically linking a program to the library gives you the same result as if the library's code was part of your program; it's baked into the resulting program. Dynamic linking does not include the library's code with your program. Instead, it relies on the operating system (specifically a component called the "dynamic 
[07:32:04] <oldlaptop> linker") to go find a copy of the library when you start the program, and bundle it in as it's loaded into memory just before it is executed.
[07:32:15] <Decker> that's cuase you did a break
[07:32:17] <Decker> that ends the loop

[07:33:26] <zero> oldlaptop: thank you
[07:33:40] <oldlaptop> Dynamic linking adds extra complexity (because the operating system needs to be able to deal with these dynamic libraries whenever it runs the program), and extra ways for things to go wrong (because someone running the program could be missing the library, or could use the wrong version, or something like that), but it also provides some flexibility - you can change the library without having to change the dynamically linked program, for example to
[07:33:40] <oldlaptop>  apply security updates.
[07:34:05] <oldlaptop> (It also can provide opportunities for memory savings, because many programs can share the same copy of the dynamic library in memory.)

[15:56:46] <mrig> pyzozord yes I have already watched and been influenced by that one, I was just thinking how I would rather not use it, but that there is no trie type text search within vim.

[15:57:30] <pyzozord> you mean finding file by it's contents or just by it's name?
[15:57:32] <mrig> I imagine that fzf is so fast as it builds and caches a data store of its constructed search data.
[15:58:17] <mrig> pyzozord you can get search results without the need of continuity, of a literal string.

[15:59:28] <pyzozord> it's not as convenient as fzf, but it gets you there too
[15:59:36] <mrig> oh right, yes using regexp in the command bar, I should take a look as I would rather not use the plugin.

[16:03:41] <pyzozord> i got that "do a lot of vertical split, even on the same file" from Jon Blow, I think Casey Muratori uses that style too
[16:04:04] <mrig> It is the use of tab to iterate through a list that vim uses that I don't like much.

[16:06:51] <mrig> .c to the left .h to the right, which is nice. But was just testing using the one file open and search to navigate for a bit.
[16:07:22] <mrig> sometimese it is nice to close down all the buffers and go minimal. I use mks alot when using tabs to get to the same state.
[16:08:04] <mrig> but this accumulates open buffers, I should look at writing a short script to close all buffers that are not in a tab, or something like that I suppose.
[16:08:40] <pyzozord> just don't use tabs, get more efficient navigating buffers
[16:09:04] <mrig> but the vim fzf plugin also uses tmux to open windows ontop of vim, I'm pretty curious to know how it does that.

[16:10:17] <pyzozord> yeah that sounds good, if leader is easily reachable
[16:10:20] <mrig> but the buffer numbers change a lot between sessions so that they do not get into muscle memory.
[16:10:29] <mrig> the mks with tabs does though.
[16:10:39] <mrig> I use space as my leader key.
[16:10:40] <pyzozord> after I got profficient with buffers I didn't use tabs anymore, only if I wanted to open like a separate project or something like that
[16:10:45] <mrig> only in normal mode.
[16:11:06] <mrig> right yes was thinking about doing this with buffers.
[16:11:27] <mrig> they are quite redundant for me at the moment.
[16:11:31] <pyzozord> space is a good choice I think I had it too :) but buffer stuff I had under ctrl-n/b for some reason my left pinky is just faster :P
[16:11:48] <pyzozord> possibly years spent playing counter strike and ducking to aim

[16:12:41] <pyzozord> oh ok, so then I can't give any advice
[16:12:50] <mrig> ah yes combat field training that would do it!

[16:16:10] <pyzozord> but nvi doesn't have nice tab-space automatic expansion, so that's when I decided to fork it and add things I need
[16:16:27] <mrig> oh thats cool, right, I've never used ed, but have learned that ed mode in vim is modelled upon it.

[17:52:14] <deniska> url is just some short text string in a particular format
[17:52:16] <teut> ya this I know
[17:52:32] <teut> OS uses programs based on extensions too

[17:55:37] <[itchyjunk]> well, binary is how our computers encodes it
[17:55:39] <deniska> So, a browser knows how to handle http and https urls. It doesn't know what to do with 'git-client' url. So it asks an OS (desktop environment) "hey, please open this git-client:// url in the appropriate program"

[17:56:40] <deniska> erm, no
[17:57:00] <deniska> You installed some software which told the OS "hey, I know what to do with git-client:// url schema"

[17:58:44] <teut> Idk
[17:59:15] <deniska> teut: another example is Steam. Steam registers itself as a handler of `steam://` schema, so after you buy a game, it gives you a link to steam://install/<game_id>
[17:59:17] <tomty89> deniska: truth is, I didn't expect any website actually makes use of URL like that

[19:45:40] <Decker> it's actually very useful
[19:46:14] <Decker> just - you can usually get around it by passing more parameters to the called function
[19:46:33] <GeDaMo> Java allows inner classes which is similar
[19:47:17] <Decker> hmm sorta - that's more like organization of code... I don't think you get access to the outer class, just the innermost
[19:47:41] <Decker> C# has nestable classes too
[19:47:53] <nomagno> In C you can use function pointers... Not really the same thing at all, but

[20:12:40] <mrig> I suppose that is not so very different from my coding in vim and using VS as a debugger, which is what I'm doing for C or C++ on windows at the moment.
[20:12:50] <pyzozord> i principle it should be possible to have cli js debuggers, nodejs implements that specific protocol
[20:13:30] <pyzozord> whos name I forget, but that essentially allows remote debugging sessions using chromes debugger protocol
[20:13:36] <mrig> I never install node.js actively avoid the npm install.
[20:14:06] <pyzozord> well to run or debug js you need some kind of program, same as with c you need gcc and gdb
[20:14:13] <mrig> I suppose this is an essential step for most js these days though.
[20:14:15] <Decker> for node - same debugger - A brwoser's F12; but you pass 'node --inspect scriptjs' or 'node --inspect-brk scriptjs'   the former will let you attach later while it's running  the -brk will stop the script at the first line of the parent script until you connect with a debugger
[20:14:31] <Decker> that used to be a pain before node-7 or late 6

[20:16:31] <Decker> npm's pretty small though - maybe a meg
[20:17:00] <mrig> It is that every time that you use anything it is installing things all over the place, seems to be.
[20:17:36] <mrig> I think that is just the package ecosystem though, the way that it works.
[20:17:49] <pyzozord> it installs only in two places: globally or current project root
[20:17:53] <Decker> that's not all over the place that's on a per-project basis
[20:18:05] <pyzozord> however it has postinstall scripts so essentially each package can do whatever it wants

[21:34:04] <apotheon> . . . so how does one give advice about doing something tricky with a list in Common Lisp when the person says "list" and one might assume it means Python (instead of something like Ruby or PHP, which use the term "array")?

[21:36:41] <apotheon> I guess beginning programmers must be assumed to have the same lack of understanding of context as non-programmers (e.g. "My internet died.  How do I fix it?" when the problem is that a browser crashed).
[21:36:56] <beaky> i like electron based software when i use electron i know it will have full cross platform support and accesibility
[21:37:17] <apotheon> The people asking might answer questions, though, also seem to just make a language assumption when answering kinda often.

[21:42:18] <sonny> maybe they want to avoid getting a standard answer, so I kinda get it

[21:43:06] <apotheon> Decker: They're also subtly different enough that often someone thinks "which language doesn't matter" and it does, with no clue in the question or the answer.
[21:43:43] <Decker> apotheon I dunno how often was the assumption wrong?
[21:43:51] <apotheon> (because maybe someone doesn't know the subtle difference, or because the answer might be tied to a subtle difference but there's no hint of that, and so on)
[21:43:58] <apotheon> Decker: hard to tell
[21:44:31] <apotheon> All too often, someone asks a question and leaves without a clear sense of whether the person's problem was really solved or just thought to be solved because someone answered in an authoritative way.
[21:44:47] <oldlaptop> apotheon: See also the endless supply of fools who think C and C++ are basically the same thing.

[21:45:27] <apotheon> You're fired.
[21:45:43] <Decker> anything C++ can do C can do better :p and with less hidden cost of generalization
[21:45:50] <apotheon> Not only are C++ and C not the same language; C++ are not the same language.
[21:45:58] <Decker> hahaa
[21:46:11] <pyzozord> oldlaptop: well from certain perspective they could be called "basically the same"
[21:46:25] <pyzozord> it doesn't necessairly mean that person holding that opinion is a fool :P
[21:46:53] <apotheon> If you mean "writing C in C++" . . . then "basically the same" is kinda true.
[21:46:58] <Decker> they have the same underlaying VM
[21:47:02] <apotheon> . . . sometimes.
[21:47:13] <pyzozord> for example if you are comparing c/c++ to lisp, haskell and coq then indede c/c++ are basically the same
[21:47:21] <apotheon> It's closer to actual C than when someone basically writes C in Ruby.
[21:47:30] <apotheon> (or tries, anyway)
[21:47:35] <oldlaptop> pyzozord: It's not really a matter of opinion: they are different in important ways. People insist otherwise, and may as well be insisting that 1 + 1 == 3.

[21:49:06] <oldlaptop> (Since objc is, unless I recall incorrectly, genuinely a superset of C defined as an extension of the C standard.)
[21:49:07] <pyzozord> and here "very" is subjective and based on context
[21:49:21] <user51> apotheon: i'll assume it's 'good'
[21:50:06] <oldlaptop> pyzozord: I am referring to the pathology of people treating "C/C++" as one unitary thing, where the two languages may freely be interchanged because (for some "common subset") there "are no differences", or "the differences don't matter".
[21:50:13] <Decker> apotheon the machine that schedules code to run... the base turing model it's based on?  we call those VM's for JS, Java, Python, I dunno state machine model?
[21:50:20] <oldlaptop> This is wrong, as a simple matter of fact.
[21:50:30] <apotheon> pyzozord: There's a difference between "they're similar" and "we need someone with C++ experience, but our job listing implies C is the same" or "I need help with this C question, but I'm calling it C/C++, so the answer given is wrong because a C++ guy answered".

[21:54:08] <apotheon> Decker: The abstraction is a *compiler* and an *assembler*, which are translators, not runtimes.
[21:55:12] <Decker> right - not the runtimes

[21:58:49] <apotheon> The fact Go bolts its own runtime onto its compiled executable rather than actually compiling to a binary without embedded runtime doesn't mean C compilers generally do anything like that.

[22:03:05] <apotheon> Descriptions of Forth that I've encountered often seem like a more constrained, simpler initial assumption to Lisp, with a rather distinct approach to designing a language around that assumption.
[22:03:14] <user51> i think getting psychological motivation is really important
[22:03:23] <apotheon> I guess the "list" vs. "stack" thing is the source of that impression.
[22:03:31] <user51> like, get some program or algorithm where forth is a natural fit

[22:04:46] <apotheon> I have often found that I get a breakthrough while learning something when I know some detail about the thing I'm learning, then suddenly have a great idea about what that detail offers in a practical way.
[22:06:08] <apotheon> e.g. suddenly realizing the <> operator in Perl would let me write a command line character stream filter utility just by making <> the condition of a while loop and iteratively printing out results.

[23:09:38] <user51> as far as expression parsing goes, you can also notice patterns
[23:09:40] <user51> e.g infix, prefix
[23:09:51] <user51> so i decided to generalize it a bit
[23:12:01] <pyzozord> is "late static binding" a thing outside of php?
[23:12:22] <user51> i think i might just implement a little forth in awk

[23:15:03] <nomagno> user51: Object Oriented Programming boils down to a few fundamental concepts, main ones being: classes, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and overloading
[23:15:17] <pyzozord> probably stawk is better
[23:15:25] <nomagno> I really suggest researching a bit until you understand first how OOP works as a whole, then each of these.
[23:16:39] <nomagno> But very simply, objects are like C structs with methods, that only expose as much of their interface as they need.
[23:17:03] <nomagno> At least that is a way of understanding a typical OOP setup
[23:17:27] <sonny> objects = methods + data, state is encapsulated in an object and complex relationships are managed in heirachies
[23:17:30] <user51> pyzozord: awk is stawk in the past, tbh
[23:17:35] <sonny> I think that is the gist of oop
[23:17:41] <user51> perl and python are better options
[23:17:53] <user51> and of course, i wrote 'pythong' accidentally..

[23:19:24] <nomagno> even if smalltalk tries to make it seem more fancy ;)
[23:19:32] <sonny> what I don't get is, if a implementation says methods can only be in a class, how can you make a library?
[23:19:39] <user51> nomagno: sometimes i wonder if it's better to write a lang rather than learn a lang
[23:19:51] <sonny> I don't get that either, message passing is just a method invocation?
[23:19:59] <Decker> you make alibrary with a bunch of classes
[23:20:15] <pyzozord> I think you can't write a good lang without knowing few good ones first
[23:20:18] <GeDaMo> Message passing doesn't have to be like a function call, it can be asynchronous
[23:20:41] <sonny> yes, but in some popular ones like java or c++, how is this done?
[23:20:50] <sonny> I thought that was the whole idea (initially)
[23:21:04] <Decker> C++ doesn't force encapsulation
[23:21:12] <pyzozord> I suspect the more and more varied languages you know the wider your horizons and better your ideas about your language
[23:21:15] <sonny> JS just uses an event loop instead right?

[23:23:43] <sonny> heh
[23:23:47] <nomagno> In truth, the only reasonable way to call JavaScript is trough specifying funtions in HTML attributes
[23:23:56] <Decker> false.
[23:24:04] <Decker> that's the worst way.
[23:24:07] <EdFletcher> and yeah, message passing can be thought of as method-invocation-once-removed: the message defines the method to be called, but there is a lookup in between. languages like objective-c had a specific hard-coded table of the most often-called methods to speed that lookup up. adding this level of indirection allowed for simple runtime introspection
[23:24:07] <EdFletcher> and modification, making the languages very dynamic. objective-c had a whole header, <objc/runtime.h>, that effectively let you completely change the implementation of things.
[23:24:16] <nomagno> Well, without getting into async*
[23:24:24] <nomagno> I don't really understand threading tbf
[23:24:29] <EdFletcher> nomagno: nearly all of my JS never interacts with HTML at all
[23:24:53] <EdFletcher> and JS is single-threaded, at least as far as the user code is concerned (I/O isn't, but that's not of your concern)
[23:25:29] <nomagno> EdFletcher: I really haven't ever written JS that isn't basically processing for HTML interactions, so I guess I just didn't think about it
[23:25:39] <pyzozord> EdFletcher: oh that's interesting about objective-c optimization
[23:26:03] <EdFletcher> nomagno: probably best not to start a statement that you didn't think much about with the phrase "In truth" then huh? ð
[23:26:23] <EdFletcher> pyzozord: objective-c is/was a fascinating, lovely, wonderful, beautiful language. i love it very much.

[23:29:37] <pyzozord> the method naming interleaved with arguments is little idiosyncratic imo, but it doesn't bother me too much
[23:30:01] <nomagno> Swift is very unsuitable for the low-level plumbing of an OS... But apple takes care of that with their super MacOS standard library, so yeah Obj-C is fairly unused today
