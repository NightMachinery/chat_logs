[01:13:47] <kwilczynski> Modern interview experience:
[01:13:54] <kwilczynski> - I would like a job, please.
[01:14:09] <kwilczynski> (company) - No problem. Now, show us what you can do...
[01:14:18] <kwilczynski> (company) - Dance monkey dance!
[01:14:50] <kwilczynski> (company) - And juggle, quick... pick up the sharp knives... and apples, and... yes you heard it right -- a pineapple. JOGGLE!
[01:14:51] <lantech19446> solve this problem we've been unable to solve for free and we'll think about hiring you for slightly above minimum wage
[01:16:02] <kwilczynski> (then you accept the offer) - Welcome on your day-1, thank you for proving yourself! Here... take this mop and a bucket, then start with the floor over there. Welcome to the family!
[01:18:09] <kwilczynski> My God.
[01:18:17] <kwilczynski> LinkedIn has turned into an absolute joke.
[01:18:25] <kwilczynski> All the Facebook people migrated over.
[01:18:56] <kwilczynski> Newborn photos, announcements of people death, humble brags and virtue signalling.
[01:18:59] <kwilczynski> Jesus.
[01:19:03] <rawtaz> yes
[01:19:13] <kwilczynski> I can't stand it.
[01:19:18] <rawtaz> theres a ton of unrelated stuff there indeed
[01:19:21] <rawtaz> me neither lol
[01:19:29] <rawtaz> all these exposures
[01:19:51] <Joel> Recently updated my linkedin title to CIEIO
[01:19:55] <kwilczynski> And people re-posting/quoting their own messages.
[01:19:59] <kwilczynski> What the fuck?
[01:20:20] <lantech19446> kwilczynski: I agree and the recruiters on linkedin can't be bothered to read a profile anymore like they don't even look at the location before they send you a job
[01:20:37] <kwilczynski> Oh year.
[01:20:43] <kwilczynski> I have Tokyo, Japan set.
[01:20:56] <kwilczynski> And I get messages about jobs in the mid-west U.S.
[01:21:06] <kwilczynski> "Phoenix"
[01:21:09] <kwilczynski> Great.
[01:21:25] <kwilczynski> It's a total garbage.
[01:21:31] <kwilczynski> I never found a job through it.
[01:21:44] <kwilczynski> But you have to have a profile there.
[01:21:48] <kwilczynski> It's like a car insurance.
[01:21:48] <lantech19446> most of the other sites aren't much better though. Is dice even worth it anymore? I honestly just feel like giving up
[01:21:57] <kwilczynski> What's dice?
[01:22:02] <rawtaz> ive actually gotten a ton of requests via linkedin, some rather serious. but also a lot from abroad companies i have no interest in
[01:22:16] <kwilczynski> I recently also discovered Blind.
[01:22:28] <lantech19446> kwilczynski: dice.com is the original tech job board that's all they do is tech
[01:22:34] <kwilczynski> Where wealthy lazy pricks from FAANG companies back-stab their peers anonymously.
[01:22:36] <lantech19446> never heard of blind
[01:22:43] <lantech19446> ah
[01:23:07] <lantech19446> rawtaz: Some of the requests I get are serious but they're 1200 miles away with no relocation
[01:23:10] <kwilczynski> https://www.teamblind.com/
[01:24:12] <kwilczynski> I see #1 reason to cry a river there is now Microsoft purchase of Blizzard.
[01:24:13] <kwilczynski> :)
[01:24:40] <kwilczynski> Haha.
[01:24:42] <kwilczynski> https://www.teamblind.com/post/Shopify-CEO-is-a-clown-rqPSeH2w
[01:25:21] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: Did you noticed that we don't have such utter nonsense in Europe?
[01:25:57] <rawtaz> what a messy site, i cant even be arsed to try and understand what its about
[01:26:29] <Joel> off topic: any sort of tech thats let you have osx windows in linux that isn't remote desktop/vnc?
[01:26:42] <lantech19446> ok I'm glad I wasn't the only one
[01:26:56] <kwilczynski> Joel: OS X windows in Linux?
[01:26:58] <lantech19446> Joel: couldn't you do it in qemu?
[01:28:15] <Joel> kwilczynski in linux you used to be able to export windows across x servers
[01:28:22] <Joel> looking to see if there's antyhing like it for osx->linux
[01:28:24] <kwilczynski> Yes, because of remove Xorg protocol.
[01:28:36] <kwilczynski> remote*
[01:30:36] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: https://www.tokyodev.com/insights/2021-developer-survey/
[01:30:46] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: Going back to Japan is going to be such a pay cut.
[01:31:08] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: However, the interviews are fun. English -> Japanese -> English -> Japanese.
[01:31:25] <lantech19446> what's making you go back to Japan?
[01:32:14] <kwilczynski> My father-in-law passed away, so we (my wife and I) are heading back to help look after mom and grandmother.
[01:32:33] <kwilczynski> Grandmother is 93 and she is more sporty than I am...
[01:32:35] <kwilczynski> :)
[01:32:44] <kwilczynski> (always calls me fat...)
[01:33:03] <lantech19446> sounds like a pleasurable experience then
[01:33:07] <kwilczynski> Also, I miss Japan.
[01:33:25] <rawtaz> am i the only one inserting random discrete links in issues when i write a comment to them on github (even in work contexts)?
[01:33:49] <rawtaz> for example i just wrote "I'd need to find myself a Windows machine to try this on, I don't have that right here right now" and made a link to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B943OFlHVs out of "right here right now" :-)
[01:33:51] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: Now. Some people at my current gig put links to Slack instead of writing anything.
[01:33:57] <rawtaz> hopefully it enlightens someone's day some day
[01:33:58] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: Which is unnerving.
[01:34:00] <lantech19446> oo thanks rawtaz you just reminded me to submit a bug report to beanstack
[01:34:43] <kwilczynski> I might also be biased as I detest Slack threads.
[01:35:12] <rawtaz> i think that if i do this often enough, people will start to think (as in, i can convince them) that it's not me doing it (because noone could possibly be arsed to do it this much/often) and instead they think that there's some video/meme linking virus active in github :-)
[01:35:45] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: We know you are a bot.
[01:35:46] <kwilczynski> :)
[01:36:00] <rawtaz> i will have to work harder >-<
[01:36:18] <rawtaz> kwilczynski: with a translator?
[01:36:31] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: Sure. An API to DeepL
[01:36:43] <rawtaz> no i meant during the interviews
[01:36:51] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: Ah no.
[01:37:00] <rawtaz> i switched to "reply with a five minute delay" mode a few seconds ago
[01:37:09] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: I got rusty after 7 years or so, however, I can still speak Japanese
[01:37:32] <rawtaz> wait, are you saying that you and your wife are moving to japan?
[01:37:32] <kwilczynski> And IT-Japanese is just a lot of borrowings so sounds like a broken English, which is kid of funny.
[01:37:39] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: Yessir.
[01:37:58] <rawtaz> wow. sounds cool. how will that be for you with your health and such though? pros/cons?
[01:38:28] <kwilczynski> Health wise probably slightly better - Japan pioneered a lot of PAH research.
[01:38:39] <kwilczynski> Life wise? I miss Japan. :)
[01:38:54] <kwilczynski> Plus, I like my mother-in-law, so it's going to fun. :)
[01:39:37] <kwilczynski> Mizuho is in Tokyo now.
[01:39:38] <rawtaz> let me guess.. your mother in law *hates* you, so every time she sees you she slaps you around and mostly on the ass with a leather whip, and since you never get any from your wife you enjoy this so much
[01:39:50] <rawtaz> so when are you leaving?
[01:39:58] <kwilczynski> If not the cats requires 6 months long quarantine, I would follow her sooner than May.
[01:40:23] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: Around May.
[01:40:34] <rawtaz> so you are bringing your cats. but do they have to sit in a quarantine for six months, down there in japan?
[01:40:38] <kwilczynski> Fluffs have to wait 6 months after getting rabies shots.
[01:40:44] <kwilczynski> No.
[01:40:51] <rawtaz> ah ok just a wait after the shot
[01:40:52] <kwilczynski> Which is why I am here with them still.
[01:40:57] <rawtaz> very nce
[01:40:58] <rawtaz> nice
[01:41:39] <kwilczynski> We can take them now, but then like you said it would be a box somewhere at a vet for 6 months.
[01:41:49] <kwilczynski> I would have to go insane to get them through this.
[01:42:34] <rawtaz> yeah no way
[01:42:38] <rawtaz> i love that youre bringing them
[01:42:42] <kwilczynski> :)
[01:42:47] <kwilczynski> Boys are family.
[01:44:11] <kwilczynski> https://www.wave.com/en/careers/job/4183834004/
[01:44:21] <kwilczynski> I think they completely missed the plot on what SRE is.
[01:44:32] <kwilczynski> It's definitely not "your PostgreSQL DBA".
[01:45:08] <rawtaz> nice logo
[02:08:14] <lantech19446> ok finally back, kwilczynski can I ask you something not devops related?
[02:13:09] <kwilczynski> Sure.
[02:13:10] <kwilczynski> Shoot.
[02:13:12] <kwilczynski> Always.
[02:13:34] <lantech19446> do you eat buckwheat?
[02:13:39] <lantech19446> kasha
[02:15:04] <kwilczynski> My favourite color is octarine. I am a leo...
[02:15:09] <kwilczynski> ... wait, what? :)
[02:15:17] <Joel> kwilczynski does it hurt when you pee?
[02:15:20] <kwilczynski> lantech19446: No, not really.
[02:15:34] <kwilczynski> Joel: Depends on which leg I stand.
[02:15:48] <lantech19446> o ok supposedly it's popular in eastern europe I got some and I have no idea what it's like lol
[02:15:58] <kwilczynski> it is.
[02:16:35] <kwilczynski> It's the Eastern Europe couscous.
[02:17:11] <lantech19446> I like couscous 
[02:17:22] <rawtaz> buckwheat is great :)
[02:17:52] <rawtaz> preferrably whole, not crushed or such, as porrage, without shell
[02:17:54] <lantech19446> I've been eating oats but it's spiking my blood sugar slightly more than I'd like it too so I'm going to mix oats and buckwheat groats to see if it spikes less, I'm hoping I'll like it
[02:18:13] <lantech19446> rawtaz: precisely what I got and how i'll be eating it. gonna make it like overnight oats
[02:20:09] <rawtaz> i recommend first heating it in water until the water starts to boil, and not any longer (then it becomes mushy), then pour off the water with the foamy stuff, rinse it through fresh water, then put it in new water and start boiling it util it's done. not too long!
[02:20:51] <lantech19446> so you're saying go with it hot, I hadn't planned on heating it
[02:21:17] <rawtaz> i mean, it's hard stuff. did you intend to like have it lay in water for a long time like beans, to soften it?
[02:21:25] <lantech19446> yep
[02:21:31] <lantech19446> 8-10 hours
[02:21:48] <rawtaz> i never tried that. it might be doable. but im hesitant about the bitter stuff thats on it, which is what you boil away in that first step
[02:22:42] <lantech19446> hmm ok, no one had mentioned that before you I guess i'll make a small batch first and see if it's unpalatable 
[02:23:49] <rawtaz> let me know how it goes with the cold way, im curious
[02:23:52] <rawtaz> perhaps it's great
[02:24:10] <lantech19446> will do
[02:26:38] <kwilczynski> lantech19446: I prefer rice. I often eat rice + natto.
[02:27:01] <kwilczynski> Alebit, couscous and buckwheat are healthy too.
[02:27:49] <lantech19446> this is for breakfast though which is why i was having the oats, some people say my sugar is fine afterwards but I feel like it's too high for my standards so I want to mix in the buckwheat to increase the fiber and carbs and decrease the fat ratio

[03:37:29] <slaughter> Offer 2 up and it's a home run. Guess I get to go back to offer 1 and see if they can make it a grand slam. That's all my baseball analogies
[03:59:22] <kwilczynski> slaughter: 500k? :)
[03:59:34] <slaughter> If you count equity then yes
[03:59:44] <slaughter> Though equity is fake so you shouldn't
[04:06:45] <slaughter> Never had the chance to “can you sweeten that deal” on a job offer, feels pretty good
[04:08:36] <rawtaz> slaughter: haha nice. what did you get to do?
[04:09:00] <slaughter> As in what's the position or?
[04:09:03] <rawtaz> equity i understand one should be very careful about
[04:09:13] <slaughter> Sorry I've been on the phone for 6 hours today my brain is mush
[04:09:14] <rawtaz> nah i mean did you have to do some coding or similar
[04:09:45] <rawtaz> hah. my last interview was like 30 minutes then they wanted to hire me. i guess they were very desperate :D (seriously, not joking on that one)
[04:10:00] <rawtaz> its probably a lot easier around here
[04:10:45] <slaughter> Oh uh no I only have done one live coding exercise in this job hunt and that was for a company an old coworker insisted I had to give a shot
[04:10:52] <slaughter> I kinda doubt they're going to give me an offer
[04:11:44] <slaughter> Not because of the live coding, I think I did fine at that. Palindrome thing, ezpz. Would have been easier if I could have looked up regex methods instead of spending 3 minutes going "hmm I know there's another one that does what I need...."
[04:12:26] <slaughter> Not even any take homes or anything. just interviews
[04:12:34] <rawtaz> sweet
[04:12:38] <slaughter> Right?
[04:12:44] <slaughter> I hate doing those
[04:12:49] <rawtaz> yeah totally
[04:12:50] <slaughter> "should only take an hour or two"
[04:12:52] <rawtaz> theyre unrealistic
[04:13:01] <rawtaz> yeah right! lol
[04:13:03] <slaughter> Lol ok so I'm going to give you the bare minimum for a job application? c'mon it's 8 hours let's not kid
[04:14:07] <kwilczynski> ?
[04:14:17] <slaughter> Though now I have enough old take homes in my github I can start using them for other stuff, so that's kinda nice. 
[04:14:50] <rawtaz> whats the url to that github
[04:15:02] <slaughter> https://github.com/slaughtr/pangram
[04:15:08] <slaughter> That's the one I setup last night
[04:15:23] <slaughter> Very basic, but for people 2 weeks into code school probably wayyyyyyy too much
[04:15:42] <slaughter> That was a take home from a couple years ago, so none of the infra or code is new just the github actions stuff
[04:16:12] <slaughter> Oooh and I should pull that infra down now that I'm done
[04:16:43] <slaughter> Thanks terraform, now the infra is gone :)
[04:19:44] <rawtaz> slaughter: nice. are the talks anywhere to be seen?
[04:20:01] <slaughter> The actual talk was recorded but it's internal to the code school
[04:20:19] <rawtaz> hmm really. no way they published it or such? maybe some student did?
[04:20:19] <slaughter> And I didn't make slides etc because I ran out of time/just going over that took most of the time anyway
[04:20:24] <rawtaz> would be interesting to see!
[04:20:55] <slaughter> Good call, just asked if I could get it
[04:21:04] <slaughter> I have other people that wanna see it anyway
[04:21:09] <rawtaz> would be kind of them to put it up on youtube or something, of course with your permission etc
[04:21:13] <slaughter> nbd just me trying to sound smart haha
[04:21:39] <slaughter> And I couldn't get the fuzzy background to work so it's just a horribly messy backdrop. Perfect for a tech talk

[20:21:19] <kwilczynski> Ask them if you can pay for your electricity with empty promises and your future colleagues experience. :)
[20:22:24] <slaughter> I wish I was willing to be that dickish in this case
[20:22:31] <slaughter> But I was ref'd by someone and wouldn't want to put that on them
[20:22:44] <kwilczynski> I think you care too much.
[20:22:52] <kwilczynski> They clearly don't give a shit about you.
[20:23:04] <kwilczynski> Your referral notwithstanding.
[20:23:09] <slaughter> Also to be clear: the offer they gave me is excellent, I just got a better offer
[20:23:21] <kwilczynski> Great.
[20:23:29] <slaughter> It's still like 10-20% above market and generous based on my YoE
[20:23:40] <kwilczynski> I am sure a director there or a VP there which brings no value whatsoever makes 5x your offer.
[20:23:40] <kwilczynski> :)
[20:23:44] <slaughter> The other offer is just 10-20% above that
[20:24:00] <slaughter> You mean the VP I'm trying to shake more money out of? :P
[20:24:10] <kwilczynski> Probably.
[20:24:25] <slaughter> It's all good, I was leaning heavily towards the better offer due to company and culture anyway, so it really just makes my life easier
[20:24:46] <slaughter> I still won't be as dickish as suggested, as much as I might enjoy that
[20:25:11] <kwilczynski> I never said you should. :)
[20:25:17] <slaughter> :)
[20:25:31] <slaughter> I've had lots of opportunity to be a bit dickish to the recruiters, which is nice
[20:25:55] <slaughter> Scum suckers*
[20:25:59] <slaughter> Weird typo there
[20:26:05] <kwilczynski> Recruiters... 
[20:27:05] <kwilczynski> I think I enjoy being self-employed.
[20:27:26] <slaughter> I have the word "AEM" on my linkedin exactly once, which is from some small poking in a prior job. The number of hair brained recruiters that have sent me "you seem like an excellent choice for this Lead AEM Admin/Developer Role" is shocking
[20:27:28] <kwilczynski> All this politics and such is now not part of my day work.
[20:28:04] <kwilczynski> slaughter: Right. Did you know that there is such a think as AWS Wind Turbine?
[20:28:37] <kwilczynski> Because I didn't... until first 5 messages about an engineer with experience in AWS Wind Turbines.

[20:49:25] <kwilczynski> ;D
[21:03:45] <nakedeyes> slaughter: is this meaning that a congrats is now appropriate or your next position is not 100% yet?
[21:04:01] <slaughter> I haven't accepted the offer yet but yeah it's 100%
[21:04:31] <slaughter> I still have some interviews today for a sorta interesting sounding gig but they're not going to be able to come close to matching on salary
[21:05:17] <slaughter> I am soon to be a fresh and shiny Senior Devops Engineer. Finally got that damn "senior" thing :)
[21:06:23] <nakedeyes> thats good news, what will you do at the new place?
[21:10:40] <slaughter> Learn!
[21:11:06] <slaughter> Work on observability and monitoring at first I believe
[21:11:44] <slaughter> Also already talking with the eng manager about how we could operationalize and standardize documentation and some ideas around using that for fun "culture" things
[21:17:21] <Joel> slaughter take better offer, let other company know you're accepting better offer, but you enjoyed interviewing with them, and "maybe in the future we'll be able to work together"
[21:18:38] <Joel> I feel like every systems level job starts with "observability and monitoring"
[21:18:43] <Joel> or so they say :P
[21:18:53] <slaughter> Yeah it's definitely a commonality I've seen
[21:19:05] <Joel> meanwhile they swamp you with something else entirely
[21:19:16] <slaughter> But this place is already setup prett well wrt the usual devops things outside of APM etc so that's the big opportunity
[21:20:00] <slaughter> Unless everyone I talked to lied to me, but I don't get the impression they did
[21:23:00] <kubblai> i have just started the job slog today. enabled looking for work on linkedin at 4 hours ago. since then had 20 messages and 10 phone calls - im only a mid level platform guy. its mental
[21:23:45] <slaughter> kubblai hell yeah it is, but that just means you're about to make wicked $$$$
[21:24:20] <slaughter> What kinds of positions are you looking for? I might be able to point you in some specific directions 
[21:24:25] <kubblai> i want a decent wage (which im on) however i just want to enjoy work and learn stuff which im not doing rn
[21:24:53] <kubblai> im looking for stuff in the UK
[21:25:12] <kubblai> slaughter are you in the UK ?
[21:25:19] <slaughter> Ahhhh yeah can't really help there, US based and didn't talk to any UK companies
[21:27:53] <kubblai> im still in probation at current role but i feel like i've achieved nothing, learned nothing and done nothing for the past few months. Ppl seem so entrenched in the silos and dont want new tech even if it solves tech debt. they're in no way agile and we dont even follow a board at standup
[21:28:32] <kubblai> my team doesnt know what its doing, is managerless and directionless and i feel lost :)
[21:29:42] <kubblai> moan over you can carry on now guys :)
[21:29:56] <kubblai> slaughter congrats on the offer :)
[21:47:02] *** Joins: BenjiProd (~BenjiProd@user/benjiprod)
[21:52:25] <slaughter> kubblai that sounds rough, I've been in a similar-ish position, at least regarding the "I'm not doing or learning anything here". I gave it 10 months before hopping, should have probably hopped 3 months in
[21:56:58] <kubblai> im kicking myself slaughter coz i'd had 10 or so interviews all going well at the time, but i just got fed and took the first offer even tho my spidey sense was tingling
[21:57:57] <slaughter> Ooof yeahhhh that's rough
[21:58:17] <slaughter> But hey now you have a default answer to some of those those annoying "describe a time" questions
[22:07:30] <kubblai> descibe a time you fucked up...ooooh oooh i know this...just which one? theres so many?
[22:08:17] <slaughter> lmao
[22:08:39] <slaughter> That's a fun question because yeah, which one to pick?
[22:12:38] <lantech19446> my problem is i'm too damn honest about it and I'll pick a time that i sincerely fucked up and makes me look bad
[22:13:26] <slaughter> Only makes you look bad if the story ends there
[22:13:56] <slaughter> How did you handle that failure? What did you do after? What did you learn? How did/would you prevent that from happening again?
[22:14:06] <lantech19446> the time I fucked up was cheating on my wife during a manic episode but hey we worked through it and we're happier than ever now, doesn't make me look much better
[22:14:19] <slaughter> jesus christ lmfao
[22:15:02] <lantech19446> I mean if they know anything about bipolar they'll get it but yea there's no making me look better in that
[22:15:18] <slaughter> You might stick to work-related answers ;)
[22:16:14] <lantech19446> i know there are times i have but I have a really hard time recalling them when put on the spot
[22:16:20] <rawtaz> slaughter: i'd just go with the second offer then, considering the first company apparently doesnt even understand how to communicate :))
[22:17:20] <slaughter> It actually got even worse - exchanged 2 more emails and boy howdy the choice is even easier
[22:18:21] <kubblai> lol @lantech19446 yeah use work examples bruh
[22:18:24] <slaughter> lantech19446 one thing a lot of people do for that is to write them down. Find those "top 20 interview questions" lists or whatever and come up with a scenario for each. If you have remote interviews then you can have them right there in your notes for reference. if you're in person you'll just want to do some memorization or whatnot
[22:19:10] <rawtaz> im having a blast here - im on the phone with dell prosupport and theyre taking a bit of time to find some information, and the longer they take, the more chocolate from this awesome vending/brewing machine i can drink :D
[22:19:27] <rawtaz> i told them to take their time, as long as i dont run out of chocolate im all good
[22:19:29] <kubblai> chubs :)
[22:19:34] <rawtaz> they replied "dont worry, we're not going to let that happen" :D
[22:19:36] <lantech19446> kubblai: slaughter yea sounds like a plan
[22:19:42] <rawtaz> i love it when support people really understand you well
[22:19:46] <lantech19446> rawtaz: but you have to talk to dell lol
[22:20:00] <rawtaz> lantech19446: yeah but its the prosupport guys
[22:20:02] <slaughter> Nice rawtaz take 'em for all they're worth
[22:20:03] <rawtaz> so its all good
[22:20:49] <kubblai> i remember me and boss a bit drunk after a liquid lunch going on dell's chat and trying to purchase a sofa. much giggled on our part but they got really annoyed
[22:21:02] <lantech19446> I've had bad experiences with them, trying to tell me that a part I just pulled from one of their servers isn't in their servers when it has a dell sticker on it
[22:22:29] <slaughter> Well it's not in the server, you puleed it out
[22:22:43] <lantech19446> lol true true
[22:22:43] <rawtaz> lantech19446: ok, sorry to hear that :<
[22:23:11] <lantech19446> a lot of these places have really gotten a lot better in the 13yrs I've been working tech, maybe Dell is one of them
[22:25:31] <rawtaz> i always go with Dell gear for servers and PCs for my clients, and of course ProSupport in pretty much every case
[22:25:56] <lantech19446> I agree, I've always had good luck with Dell servers
[22:35:16] <rawtaz> i dont hear a lot of good about HP so i never even considered then. also now i know a bit aobut the dell products so why not make use of that

[22:49:18] <lantech19446> I love HP's stuff for workstations it just keeps working I never have problems with them
[23:21:54] <rawtaz> ok :>
[23:29:01] <rawtaz> i kind of got fed up with how silly HP is when it comes to their firmware for EoL products, unless im mistaken you need to buy expensive licenses etc to be able to get such updates, which is plain silly.
[23:29:06] <rawtaz> that and other things
[23:29:13] <rawtaz> cant say i was *ever* impressed by their sloppy laptops
[23:29:23] <rawtaz> although to be fair they did get better in recent years, thats undeniable
[23:30:06] <lantech19446> we don't keep a workstation long enough to even worry about that usually. we try to cycle every 3 years
[23:39:15] <rawtaz> whats the point of that if the computer still works and isnt slow or problematic for the user?
[23:41:16] <lantech19446> it's just what they've always done, I don't replace mine that often because I get far more competent machines than the staff do but there really is no point to it other than to use up budget at the end of a year
[23:42:59] <rawtaz> what a complete waste
[23:43:08] <rawtaz> thats a bad place you work at :(

[23:45:53] <lantech19446> I work in a use it or lose it because we're funded by the borough it's not like we're wasting opex
[23:47:12] <rawtaz> whats opex?
[23:47:43] <kubblai> operational expenditure
[23:47:50] <rawtaz> soo, money?
[23:48:28] <rawtaz> regardless, you are wasting environment. thats the biggest issue
[23:48:52] <rawtaz> obviously youre also wasting time, energy and money that could be spent elsewhere, but whatever
[23:49:13] <kubblai> rawtaz: the way these orgs are funded like libraries if they dont spend it their budget is cut
[23:50:10] <kubblai> then when they do need to buy new stuff theres no money
[23:50:18] <lantech19446> pyep
[23:50:27] <rawtaz> yeah i hear you. but that isnt really an excuse to waste environment.. sorry
[23:50:44] <lantech19446> and rawtaz they don't go to the dump I reinstall them and we sell em for like 30 dollars to people who can't afford to buy a new desktop
[23:50:57] <rawtaz> we're *way* past the point where we had the luxury of doing being entitled to do so
[23:50:58] <lantech19446> sometimes we'll even just give one to someone
[23:51:46] <rawtaz> lantech19446: i suspected as much, but the problem is that you are driving the production of new goods and even if the old stuff is reused theres still a general overhead to this entire process and also it drives the consumption
[23:52:07] <rawtaz> anyway i gotta head home. im not changing any of that pesky place you work at with my arguments anyway so it's 100% irrelevant :>
[23:52:10] * rawtaz &
