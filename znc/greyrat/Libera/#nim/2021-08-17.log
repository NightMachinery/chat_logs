[08:28:00] <madprops> there we go

[14:26:49] <FromDiscord> <Chiggy> hmm ok
[14:27:16] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> this is a single encounter of this, or you have multiple conversions like this?
[14:27:47] <FromDiscord> <Chiggy> just one more encounter
[14:27:49] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> you can do `mgetOrPut` and move `parseInt(...) + SECONDS` part into proc

[14:28:04] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> if it is one instance then I would not bother
[14:34:02] <PMunch> Could you try to put that template thing outside that if statement and see if it works? You would reduce all that by quite a bit if it did, but mostly I'm just curious :P
[14:34:33] <FromDiscord> <Chiggy> yeah sure
[14:35:20] <PMunch> By the way, Nim typically uses 2 spaces instead of 4 for indentation. It works with 4 as well, but if you want to write code following the convention you should switch to 2
[14:35:31] <FromDiscord> <Chiggy> oh
[14:35:33] <FromDiscord> <Chiggy> didnt know that
[14:35:41] <FromDiscord> <Chiggy> btw nk is already a string
[14:35:42] <PMunch> It looks a bit odd at first, but once you get used to it 4 spaces looks like a massive waste :P
[14:35:47] <FromDiscord> <Chiggy> should I change template name?

[14:36:33] <FromDiscord> <Chiggy> like so?
[14:36:37] <PMunch> The untyped is supposed to be on the same line, it's the return type of the template
[14:36:46] <FromDiscord> <Chiggy> oh
[14:36:57] <PMunch> It's really `template nkt(): untyped = <body>`

[14:37:20] <PMunch> Similar to a proc, but a template instead. And you can omit the parenthesis
[14:37:53] <PMunch> The ; was just to split it into a newline

[14:44:27] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> yes
[14:44:45] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> but it depends on what you do - if it's number crunching or some calculations, then it'll be much faster, if it's IO - don't expect a big boost
[14:44:46] <PMunch> Yes, that is debug mode by default, and yes adding `-d:release` will very likely give you a speed boost

[15:03:10] <FromDiscord> <Chiggy> hmm
[15:03:23] <FromDiscord> <dom96> If it's just to create JSON strings then why not just use the stdlib?
[15:03:52] <FromDiscord> <Chiggy> yeah that was the plan was just curious to know if jsony has something for it
[15:19:42] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> jsony is faster
[15:20:07] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> and it does not have do two allocations for `T -> JsonNode -> string`
[15:20:48] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> So for serialization I think it makes sense to use it instead of the stdlib

[21:25:21] <FromDiscord> <Rika> That way deleting a node doesn’t change index
