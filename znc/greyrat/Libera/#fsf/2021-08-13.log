[20:41:46] <tpefreedom> Is obfuscated code effectively nonfree even when under a free license?
[20:42:06] <tpefreedom> I've heard some people argue something like that.

[20:44:21] <craigt> tpefreedom: If you look at the GPLv3: "The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it."
[20:44:37] <kompowiec> tpefreedom: No, if your use GPL: The GNU General Public License since version 2 has defined "source code" as "the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it." This is intended to prevent the release of obfuscated source code.[57]

[21:44:47] <adfeno> I and GNUtoo from Replicant noted that MicroG still communicates with Google and since the Google-services + Android allows Google to exercise past-proven control over Android, there is no way to know for sure what they will do later: https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/malware-google.html
[21:46:17] <adfeno> Once a Android-based system distribution allows for stablishing the relation of Google-services + Android by default, there is no way for countering possible wrong-doings from Google.
[21:46:29] <craigt> [APPROVED] https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Pandoc ([source link and category updates])

[22:58:42] <Noisytoot> Hello
[22:58:46] <craigt> tpefreedom: Yes. It is essentially https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/License:HPND with "sell" as another permission.
[22:58:46] <opal> if it was included in fdroid it would be listed as "promotes nonfree services"
[22:58:47] <opal> thats it
[22:58:54] <opal> it isnt "malware"
[22:59:05] <opal> not everyone shares either your or fsf's ideals when it comes to free software, stop acting like a cult
[22:59:10] <Noisytoot> opal, I don't think F-Droid is FSDG-compliant
[22:59:11] <opal> this is how you guys push people out

[22:59:40] <adfeno> craigt, panosalevro, tpefreedom: Re: HPND sell version: I'm no longer a reviewer myself, but since FSD has a project team to make licenses follow SPDX, I would take a look at SPDX first and see if that has a flag for that license.
[22:59:52] <craigt> Noisytoot: Hello! Welcome to this week's FSD meeting.
[23:00:03] <opal> if i find a benefit to using microg or anything else, i will use it, until better alternatives come around

[23:00:15] <opal> and i am keeping on top of shit like openpush or whatever is active right now
[23:00:23] <adfeno> opal: FDroid doesn't follow the FSDG.
[23:00:28] <opal> i care
[23:00:32] <opal> i truly deeply care
[23:00:36] <opal> microg is not malware
[23:01:11] <opal> so stop lying if you dont want me to correct you
[23:01:15] <opal> thanks
[23:01:32] <Noisytoot> that depends on your definition of malware
[23:01:46] <opal> Malware (a portmanteau for malicious software) is any software intentionally designed to cause damage to a computer, server, client, or computer network.
[23:01:48] <adfeno> opal: MicroG has connection to Google, and there is no other Push Notifications server.
[23:01:55] <kompowiec> >  fsf isnt the church of free software my dude
[23:01:58] <kompowiec> i think it should be protected that way. My favorite example is Japan, which forces you to buy a phone when you are a foreigner and install skype.
[23:02:00] <opal> i go with the commonly-accepted definition from the established security community
[23:02:10] <adfeno> Perhaps we should make them provide one Push server with OpenPush, then.
[23:02:10] <opal> japan's indeed scummy for doing that
[23:02:18] <opal> adfeno that'd be ideal yeah
[23:02:22] <Noisytoot> opal, Does microg require a google account?
[23:02:26] <opal> no Noisytoot 
[23:02:36] <kompowiec> something like jehovah's witnesses.
[23:02:46] <opal> i think you can even fudge the phone identifier, let me check

[23:03:34] <opal> i used to be more idealist than i am now, now i emphasise practicality because ive been working with computers long enough lol
[23:04:21] <kompowiec> same
[23:04:22] <opal> i use GCM with twitch, keybase, and coinbase on my phone
[23:04:39] <opal> those apps are nice enough for me to keep them on my phone without too much complaint
[23:04:53] <kompowiec> but I still try to use libre software where possible.
[23:05:19] <opal> (and yes im aware of keybase alternatives, i may use them in addition but not as a replacement to keybase)
[23:05:21] <opal> kompowiec same
[23:05:41] <tpefreedom> If it's all about practicality and convenience then people won't call out unfair dynamics unless it personally benefits them.
[23:05:49] <opal> i was on keybase back when the chat and other stuff wasnt even a thing, so i mostly use it as a keyserver
[23:05:59] <kompowiec> hmm
[23:05:59] <kompowiec> https://alternativeto.net/software/keybase/?license=opensource
[23:06:04] <kompowiec> it's suck
[23:06:08] <opal> im vocal about unfairness even if i utilise certain things
[23:06:53] <kompowiec> tbh I would never put my keepass on the internet. USB flash drive only.
[23:06:53] <opal> i'll be one of the first to criticise coinbase for not having a libre mobile app, to criticise keybase for not making it easier to package on fdroid, to criticise twitch for a wealth of reasons
[23:07:06] <opal> what does keepass have to do with it
[23:07:14] <opal> keybase allows one to upload a public pgp key and nothing else
[23:07:41] <kompowiec> it's password manager - keepass create just encrypted file with your passwords
[23:07:46] <opal> i know, i used it before
[23:07:49] <opal> wasnt my question

[23:08:39] <opal> pass is also nice for scripting e.g. in cli/tui MUAs
[23:08:57] <kompowiec> I have never used a keybase but it resembles a communicator with the ability to store keys. Do you have access to your keys at all?
[23:09:03] <opal> and i use my proprietary yubikey to store my pgp subkeys :^)

[23:09:51] <kompowiec> nitrokey, nah, i don't trust hardware auth
[23:09:55] <opal> i strongly recommend against uploading private keys to keybase even if they promise to client-side encrypt them
[23:10:19] <opal> i trust online systems to keep my ciphertext safe, less than i trust a hardware token
[23:10:27] <opal> its all about threat model anyway

[23:30:34] <tpefreedom> The more practical issue is that swearing/vulgarity and more generally not being sublte can turn some people off. Some people just prefer to hear hard truths behind a layer of euphemisms and whatnot.

[23:40:16] <kompowiec> I was learning HTML and CSS when does exist HTML4, now the market has changed so much that I can't imagine learning these new things, i don't like webdev and frontend
[23:41:34] <kompowiec> But I think if I wanted to work in the IT sector, today I would have no choice.
[23:42:33] <opal> there are still opportunities for people who have experience with non-web technologies; definitely still a demand for it
[23:42:54] <opal> but yes the general direction of the market has been to migrate to web and cloud (read: containerisation/devops) technologies
[23:43:28] <opal> i applied to isc/bind and refused the application since they require extensive use of zoom
[23:43:38] <kompowiec> rather android applications
[23:43:47] <opal> caught me off guard that they wanted to do video conferencing over that
[23:43:58] <opal> i dont like video conferencing in general, but i'd settle with at least jitsi
[23:44:08] <opal> oh yeah mobile dev is in demand too
[23:44:36] <opal> and IoT if you're into embedded
[23:44:37] <kompowiec> same, i never use video
[23:44:48] <opal> not only IoT though, thats just the booming market now
[23:45:06] <opal> a market whose direction i disagree with
[23:45:12] <kompowiec> Now they are said to be creating a new industry, the internet of body.
[23:45:22] <opal> "move fast and break things" isnt a great idea for devices that have lan access
[23:45:50] <opal> oh now transhumanists are weaseling their way into the mainstream?
[23:45:52] <opal> screw that
[23:46:03] <adfeno> To clarify: I meant “to step” in the sense of participating on making the regulation/standard.

[23:49:03] <adfeno> I think that governments should only accept 5G if all the implementers make their 5G-stuff free/libre.
[23:49:10] <opal> my prepaid carrier offers truly unlimited 5g for free though
[23:49:13] <opal> lte is the only thing limited
[23:49:48] <bugweiser> I had to try and use jitsi the other week. I found it horrible! Especially couse it don't work (and their community didn't seem to care one bit). And the problems I ran into turned out to exist over a year now. My honest impression is that the html-port in browser was just an afterthought.
[23:50:21] <kompowiec> adfeno: it's like requiring flash to be libre. Patent dependency hell will make this impossible.
[23:50:24] <bugweiser> It didn't work at home, didn't work in the public library, didn't work over at friends.

[23:54:37] <bugweiser> the bugs already start in the html header (though that's nitpicking, but still.. the devs don't appear to know/care al that much how browsers work and the specs)
[23:54:43] <opal> and i barely use my google account anymore
[23:54:55] <bugweiser> anyhow, thats my final 2 cent about jitsi :)

[23:57:05] <kompowiec> I don't know why but even when both parties had android client conversations, I couldn't make a voice call.
