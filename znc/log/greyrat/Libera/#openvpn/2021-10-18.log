[09:30:38] <pingufan> plaisthos: I found the description in  FAQ, but it seems to not work (or I did something wrong).   I added the following line to the profile in TAB   "Serverlist" -> "Own Options":     >>> tls-cipher "DEFAULT:@SECLEVEL=0"<<<    
[09:33:22] <pingufan> Then I tried to establish a VPN connection.   The error is different, but I don't get a tunnel opened.    The error is: "OpenSSLContext:  SSL_CTX_set_cipher_list failed"
[09:35:49] <pingufan> plaisthos: The major issue is that I cannot do anything on server side, this will disconnect many home workers. So the workaround needs to be  done only on client side, with unchanged config file.

[09:54:24] <pingufan> I guess "DEFAULT:@SECLEVEL=0"  is not re-establishing the previous behavior, therefore only the error changes.It will be better to add another option, makung it working exactly as before.

[15:59:27] <pingufan> Ok, I downloaded it from APKMirror.   So I can re-install it in worst case.

[16:09:58] <plaisthos> plai.de/android or github.com/schwabe/ics-openvpn if you want something more official than apkmirror
[16:13:48] <pingufan> Thank yo very much.  You should keep this options inside the app. ;)

[16:19:52] <plaisthos> pingufan: yeah. BUt I cannot guarantee that OpenSSL will keep support forever
[16:20:04] <plaisthos> if OpenSSL drops it in 5 years or so, then it is gone
[16:20:16] <pingufan> Guess why I made a backup...
[16:20:36] <plaisthos> E.g. I don't think TLS 1.0/1.1 support will be around in a few years
[16:22:01] <pingufan> I have a customer where >70% of employees is home-working. So you have almost no chance to do a plain switch.
[16:23:30] <pingufan> So I will have to run there the system as is. No chance.
[16:27:35] <pingufan> In worst case I will have to switch to ssh tunnel 
[16:38:32] <plaisthos> run a second server instance. Do cross signing, resign the cacert
[16:46:52] <plaisthos> pingufan: you can ignore the issue for now
[16:47:16] <plaisthos> but I will bet that Ubuntu 22.04 will have the same behaviour as my app
[16:47:48] <plaisthos> And OpenVPN 2.6.0 for Windows will probably also include OpenSSL 3.0 and behave the same way

[17:17:36] <plaisthos> pingufan: you do not need a new openssl version for the server
[17:17:52] <plaisthos> you need fixed certificates
[17:18:28] <plaisthos> Even OpenSSL 1.0.2 on a software museum called RHEL7 will do fine
[17:46:06] <rob0> So, I have an IRC client (not this one) on an Android, and it connects to an ircd I control.  The problem is many flapping connections annoying other people in IRC.
[17:46:48] <rob0> I pushed a route to ip.add.re.ss/32 and NAT that, and it works, but the connection flaps worse than ever.
[17:47:32] <rob0> With --duplicate-cn it wasn't quite as bad, but I hate --duplicate-cn.
[17:48:30] <rob0> I guess without it, and the VPN IP address going away, the IRC client disconnected itself.
[17:50:31] <rob0> Maybe I should try a p2p tunnel, fixed IP addresses on both sides, and just configure the IRC client to connect to the peer address instead of the NAT?

[17:53:18] <havoc> rob0: stupid question, but does the irc client sleep at all on your android device?
[17:53:38] <rob0> no
[17:53:44] <havoc> ...is it the tunnel thats's dropping, or the irc client?
[17:53:46] <havoc> ok
[17:54:05] <havoc> and I'm assuming you have keepalive on the tunnel
[17:54:32] <rob0> if I stay home on wifi and without VPN, IRC stays connected
[17:54:36] <rob0> yes
[17:55:14] <havoc> so the tunnel itself is definitely dropping/reconnecting?
[17:56:04] <rob0> Yes, the VPN drops and reconnects.  I know static key is going away, but p2p mode will still be doable?
[17:56:29] <havoc> static key is going away?
[17:56:47] <rob0> I've seen dazo saying that.
[17:57:05] <havoc> in openvpn, or the android client?
[17:57:17] <rob0> not deprecated yet, but in his sites, in openvpn core
[17:57:18] * havoc should pay attention to such things
[17:57:28] <rob0> *sights
[17:57:54] * havoc looks for docs
[17:58:35] <rob0> I suppose the Android client would work with any valid --config
[17:58:37] <havoc> any links are welcome
[17:59:09] <rob0> I'm not sure.  I think I read it in #openvpn-devel
[17:59:18] <havoc> ah
[17:59:35] <pingufan> Hope that a _useful_ step-by-step instruction for fixing certs will become available.
[17:59:35] <havoc> so interactive auth only then?
[18:00:04] <havoc> ...to replace static keys?
[18:02:38] <rob0> I asked him in there.  Really not sure.  But it caught my eye because I have used static key tunnels a lot.  I even have one running now.
[18:02:49] <plaisthos> it is already deprecated in master
[18:03:58] <plaisthos> https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn/commit/60f5889ae6f73c710c6d96a2ee71a41654d3d091
[18:04:27] <plaisthos> pingufan: I don't even know what you used to generate the certificates
[18:04:38] <plaisthos> pingufan: that entirely depends on what you used for that
[18:04:51] <pingufan> easy-rsa 2.0 in its default settings.
[18:05:19] <pingufan> non-tls
[18:05:33] <plaisthos> pingufan: you are confused
[18:05:41] <pingufan> for sure.
[18:05:53] <plaisthos> pingufan: if you have certificates you use TLS
[18:06:02] <pingufan> I will be very happy when I am retiring in 5 years.
[18:06:13] <rob0> retirement++
[18:06:19] <pingufan> Then all this crap is behind me.
[18:06:22] <ordex> pingufan: that's still quite some time to go - don't give up fighting now!
[18:06:34] <plaisthos> pingufan: I don't use easy-rsa so I cannot answer you that
[18:06:38] <pingufan> I don't give up
[18:06:40] <plaisthos> how to regenerate certificates
[18:06:40] <havoc> ah, so it's --secret that's going away
[18:06:45] <plaisthos> havoc: yes
[18:06:52] <havoc> not "static keys"
[18:07:00] <havoc> that's ok then
[18:07:19] <plaisthos> havoc: --secret is the only static key mode that openvpn supports
[18:07:23] <pingufan> Hope this SSL stuff will stay as is till then
[18:07:34] <plaisthos> pingufan: TLS is SSL
[18:07:45] <plaisthos> pingufan: OpenVPN *NEVER* supported SSL2 or SSL3
[18:07:51] <havoc> I was thinking of the term "static key" literally
[18:08:04] <havoc> it's a "key" that does not change, "static"
[18:08:04] <plaisthos> havoc: --secret is pretty much static key
[18:08:19] <ordex> indeed
[18:08:21] <havoc> I use CRT, TLS, DH, all "static keys"
[18:08:39] <ordex> havoc: that's another context :)
[18:08:43] <ordex> also my config is static
[18:08:44] <ordex> :p
[18:08:48] <pingufan> Really, I don't need all that.
[18:08:51] <plaisthos> havoc: I would drop that terminology. That just confuses everybody involved
[18:09:08] <plaisthos> pingufan: Complain to OpenSSL
[18:09:13] <pingufan> :)
[18:09:18] <havoc> plaisthos: yes, hence my misunderstanding
[18:09:22] <plaisthos> pingufan: we just following the stream
[18:10:05] <pingufan> I understand.   But sometimes it is worth to brake a bit
[18:10:26] <plaisthos> pingufan: google for easy-rsa md5 to sha1 maybe there is already an instruction for it
[18:10:53] <havoc> what is is using --tls-crypt/--ca/--cert/--key/--dh called, in the context of openvpn?
[18:11:01] <plaisthos> the same problem already happend a few years ago when md5 was deprecated. Maybe someone sat down and wrote a tutorial
[18:11:18] <plaisthos> havoc: ca/cert/key are TLS certificates just like everywhere
[18:11:23] <pingufan> You think I use MD5?    openvpn on the servers don't have it listed at all.
[18:11:24] <plaisthos> tls-crypt is it own thing
[18:11:39] <plaisthos> pingufan: your reading comprehension is not good
[18:11:52] <havoc> I typically use all of what I listed in my "standard" config
[18:12:00] <plaisthos> I said that MD5 depreaction was the same a few years ago, just like SHA1 now
[18:12:11] <plaisthos> Not saying that you used MD5
[18:12:36] <havoc> so what I use is "TLS"
[18:12:37] <havoc> ?
[18:12:41] <plaisthos> jsut saying a MD5 -> SHA256 or MD5 -> SHA1 easy-rsa guide should be pretty easy to adapt to SHA1 -> SHA25
[18:12:44] <plaisthos> havoc: yes
[18:12:48] <havoc> ok, thanks
[18:13:05] <pingufan> THAT you mean. 
[18:13:14] <havoc> just want to get the contextual terminology correct
[18:13:53] <pingufan> I am not very familiar with this openvpn stuff. So I am always needing working examples I can follow. 
[18:14:30] <pingufan> This is the quickest and most efficient way I understand
[18:15:54] <plaisthos> yeah hope someone writes a tutorial for you 
[18:16:21] <pingufan> I am pretty sure I am not the only one looking for it.
[18:18:03] <plaisthos> yeah but a lot of people just setup a 2nd server and migrate or have small setups where they can just do a hard switch over
[18:18:31] <plaisthos> and people with large critical setup often then pay someone to do it for them
[18:18:38] <plaisthos> in my experience
[18:18:48] <plaisthos> or pay for software that manages the certificates for them
[18:18:58] <pingufan> In most cases I have servers running "all-in-one". Fileserver, blah, firewall,openvpn.
[18:19:58] <pingufan> Therefore I close that systems to absolutely minimum in firewall. From outside you have only VPN access.
[18:20:24] <pingufan> Works nice and you don't have to secure anything else...

[19:02:21] <rob0> Okay, so what I need is a --topology p2p but with TLS rather than --secret.  That might be worthy of a new mini-howto, because AFAIK we don't have that documented/described anywhere.
[19:04:46] <rob0> um, not --topology, just --mode p2p
[19:05:00] <BtbN> Is that even possible? Given how a PKI works by principle?
[19:05:10] <BtbN> One of the two has to act as server
[19:06:35] <rob0> yeah, I'm not sure, but I think you can have a "--tls-server" peer
[19:10:03] <plaisthos> BtbN: yes it is supported
[19:10:24] <plaisthos> BtbN: the pki is just used as "do I trust the other guy?"
[19:10:38] <plaisthos> peer-fingerprint is probably easier to use for p2p than a full CA
[19:10:55] <rob0> oh, nice
[19:11:23] <BtbN> But the PKI only really establishes that trust one way, normally
[19:11:45] <plaisthos> BtbN: well not really
[19:12:20] <plaisthos> we are just so used to user/pass from client and cert from server that people have forgotten that TLS is designed for mutal trust with cert from both client and server
[19:12:46] <plaisthos> I actually implemented proper NCP cipher negotiation for P2P in 2.6 https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn/commit/8c72d7981c32c43d1c7967a312bb439e13fc5b40
[19:12:52] <rob0> no --peer-fingerprint in 2.5
[19:13:32] <plaisthos> no 
[19:13:56] <plaisthos> but the peer-fingeprint howto gives you the workaround of using the peer's cert as CA cewrt
