[00:01:35] <TechTest> well, it's basically a job interviewer who emailed me to let me know they liked my CV, but they didn't mention that they want to hire me or that they rejected me or that they want to schedule an interview
[00:02:22] <TechTest> I figured out I'll just reply something so I'm nice... I guess
[00:02:51] <blkshp> Are you 100% sure?
[00:03:05] <TechTest> what do you mean?
[00:03:06] <blkshp> Seems a little strange for them to just say "huh, I like your CV"
[00:03:23] <blkshp> Sure you're not missing a page 2?
[00:03:28] <TechTest> no
[00:03:44] <TechTest> that they liked it and that they are currently processing it
[00:03:54] <blkshp> See... missing information!
[00:04:05] <TechTest> missing?
[00:04:31] <blkshp> Yes. You didn't mention that they said they were reviewing it.
[00:04:39] <TechTest> they don't mention I'm hired or rejected, so it seems like a useless email
[00:05:04] <blkshp> No, the point of the email is to provide a holding page to say they had received it and were currently processing it.
[00:05:36] <blkshp> To which you reply "Thank you for the Information, I look forward to further updates" or something to that effect.
[00:05:48] <blkshp> It's a receipt/
[00:05:51] <TechTest> is that something UK employers tend to do?
[00:05:55] <blkshp> Yes
[00:06:00] <TechTest> ah
[00:06:04] <blkshp> I think
[00:06:13] <TechTest> it nevee happened to me before
[00:06:13] <blkshp> I have never had an email job offer
[00:06:27] <blkshp> I have never submitted any job applications electronically
[00:06:45] <blkshp> But that's what it sounds like.
[00:06:49] <rud0lf> what about text message?
[00:06:53] <TechTest> I thought it was strange because mentioning that they liked it means they have already reviewed it, so they could move further
[00:06:59] <rud0lf> or push notification?
[00:07:05] <blkshp> rud0lf: also comes under the "Electronically" banner.
[00:07:10] <rud0lf> mhm
[00:07:25] <blkshp> All my applications have been in person and with physical, printed CVs
[00:07:38] <blkshp> Though i have only had 3 and one of those was a temp job.
[00:07:39] <huf> how quaint
[00:07:43] <TechTest> blkshp: so are you saying " Thank you for the information" is formal?
[00:07:59] <blkshp> I think so.
[00:08:12] <TechTest> if you say so :D
[00:08:20] <blkshp> huf: i have been on the same account now for 14 years in many different guises.
[00:08:35] <blkshp> "Cheers for the info gov" is informal
[00:08:46] <TechTest> if they reject me I will blame you, if they hire me and the job ends up being crap, I will blame you 
[00:09:07] <LuisP14> lol
[00:09:13] <blkshp> You use my suggestions at your own risk
[00:09:31] <blkshp> I will not feel guilty about that (actually I would, a lot)
[00:09:55] <LuisP14> and if you get hired and the job is good, you shall still blame him!
[00:09:59] <mouseghost> thx 4 info bro
[00:10:18] <blkshp> IF he gets hired he owes me 1% of all earnings.
[00:10:27] <LuisP14> xD
[00:10:42] <mouseghost> blacksheep
[00:11:00] <TechTest> blkshp: yeah I don't think that "Thank you for the information" vs "thank you for informing me" is what will get me hired or not 
[00:11:29] <blkshp> I dunno, i once didn't hire a bloke because he had on too much aftershave.
[00:11:32] <TechTest> that job is not on the top of my lists anyways
[00:11:45] <TechTest> uh, seriously?
[00:11:56] <TechTest> I'm glad I don't work for you 
[00:12:11] <blkshp> No, he was a liar in his CV but he did have too much aftershave when he came for interview.
[00:12:11] <mouseghost> blkshp best employer
[00:12:30] <mouseghost> is aftershave like perfume
[00:12:37] <blkshp> Basically.
[00:12:38] <TechTest> mouseghost: go work for him, we'll see how long you'll last :P
[00:12:52] <blkshp> mouseghost: but it does have a practical purpose following a shave.
[00:12:57] <mouseghost> blkshp, what industry, though
[00:12:59] <TechTest> I'm only looking for at home jobs, so my aftershave won't be a problem
[00:13:06] <mouseghost> well, i do just pure 96% spirit on my face
[00:13:09] <TechTest> actually I'm not even using aftershave
[00:13:19] <blkshp> At the time it was a 3rd line IT support Job.
[00:13:24] <mouseghost> ah meh\
[00:14:49] <blkshp> I don't either, it brings me out in a rash
[00:16:02] <TechTest> I don't because I don't shave
[00:16:25] <mouseghost> why no shave
[00:16:33] <TechTest> I don't have much to shave 
[00:16:37] <blkshp> Hairy mann
[00:16:44] <mouseghost> theres always something to shave
[00:16:58] <TechTest> but maybe I should shave off what I have than having patchy facial hair
[00:17:05] * LuisP14 does not shave his beardstache
[00:17:29] <TechTest> I think I look like I'm 14 if I shave everything
[00:18:52] <rud0lf> everything?
[00:18:53] <blkshp> And he's really 15
[00:19:05] <rud0lf> >_>

[00:36:38] <rud0lf> don't you need them as an emergency solution?
[00:36:45] <blkshp> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[00:36:48] <LuisP14> four years to go, mm :3
[00:36:48] <rud0lf> they are more reliable than some walkie-talkie

[00:37:31] <rud0lf> by it's definition there would
[00:37:36] <blkshp> I mean i suppose at this point having no access to an internet connected device to make a phone call, it's unlikely.
[00:38:54] <huf> rud0lf: not if they outlaw them
[00:39:04] <LuisP14> lol

[06:25:02] <twb> I'm asking about duals
[06:25:51] <twb> As opposed to most humans (singular) or gestalts (plurals)
[06:26:29] <twb> My guess is it happens rarely enough to not have had any discussino
[06:37:25] <StayHungry> twb: as a non-native i see it as an outcome of prolonged self-indulgence encouraged from above to split society in a spirit of 'divide and rule' under the guise of being progressive. and it relates not only to 'which gender you associate with today', but about the recognition of mental deviations as peculiarities in general. the more you reckon with this, the more often you will have to think about each new quirk of those who want

[17:25:08] <kurahaupo> I'm wondering to what extent it's now considered "normal" or "preferable" not to remove the final silent "e" when adding a suffix that doesn't itself start with "e", such as "-ing". I often see spellings like "queueing" and "parseing" when I would normally use "queuing" and "parsing".
[17:26:17] <kurahaupo> Curiously the same doesn't seem to apply when adding "-ed" - I've never seen "queueed" or "parseed"
[17:29:05] <kurahaupo> From my perspective, failure to remove the "e" seems like a misapprehension of its purpose (as a phonetic modifier of a preceding grapheme, which is equally well performed by "i")
[17:30:46] <kurahaupo> On the other hand, where it modifies the preceding consonant, perhaps there's an argument to be made for the clarity of "Bingeing on netflix" vs "Binging on that other search engine" - though this doesn't come naturally to me.

[17:36:50] <kurahaupo> Hint 1: Lucifer is name of the devil, the lord of hell
[17:38:18] <kurahaupo> Hint 2: hell is reputed to be uncomfortably hot, whereas ice-skating requires cold conditions

[17:42:59] <kurahaupo> There's a line in the movie "Fifth Element" where the "scientist" say that the approaching planetoid has a surface temperature of minus a million degrees or somesuch, at which point I'm like "You're obviously not a real scientist, and your script writers missed the definition of "absolute zero" in their middle school science classes.

[23:30:48] <bin> i think i've had a 12 course once
[23:30:50] <huf> that sounds like a whole day
[23:30:56] <huf> 7 fishes...
[23:31:08] <bin> or maybe twice
[23:31:15] <huf> you start drinking and dancing in the morning, eat some of the fishes, then repeat until you fall over
[23:31:18] <huf> or run out of fishes
[23:31:25] <bin> I just remember because of the amuse-bouche and palate cleansers
[23:31:50] <CuriosTiger> 12 course?
[23:31:57] <CuriosTiger> Is each course like one bite?
[23:31:59] <blkshp> The Amuse-bouche i think is standard for any high class
[23:32:07] <blkshp> https://www.webstaurantstore.com/blog/2578/full-course-meal.html#12-course
[23:32:10] <bin> blkshp: technically not 
[23:32:13] <blkshp> No but it's served over several hours
[23:32:32] <CuriosTiger> blkshp: Je ne parlez pas français.
[23:32:36] <LuisP14> ¯\_(o.o)_/¯
[23:32:41] <blkshp> Sorry to hear that
[23:32:43] <bin> I remember the palate cleanser being some kinds of delightful sorbet
[23:33:08] <CuriosTiger> blkshp: I did find something similar though.
[23:33:32] <CuriosTiger> https://www.bigtexan.com/72-oz-steak/
[23:33:38] <CuriosTiger> (72 oz = 2 kg)
[23:34:07] <bin> The steak I'm making tonight is ~1kg
[23:35:53] <bin> weighed a bit less than i expected but we have pleny of sides so it should be good. 
[23:36:30] <blkshp> Someone ate it in 17 minutes.
[23:37:33] <CuriosTiger> Yep. Someone also ate it in about 3 seconds, but to be fair, that was a publicity stunt and the "someone" was a tiger brought in for the occasion.
[23:37:54] <blkshp> xD
[23:37:54] <CuriosTiger> and luckily, they bent the rules so the tiger didn't have to eat the salad or the baked potato.
[23:38:24] <CuriosTiger> (Trust me...if you give vegetables to a tiger, you will NOT like what comes out the other end.)
[23:38:37] <CuriosTiger> (and the tiger won't enjoy it either.)
[23:38:37] <blkshp> IS this from personal experience?!
[23:38:56] <CuriosTiger> Yes.
[23:39:08] <CuriosTiger> I have not fed vegetables to tigers, but I have had to clean up the aftermath.
[23:39:17] <CuriosTiger> I've also had to comfort tigers with tummy aches.
[23:40:43] <blkshp> aw :(
[23:40:57] <blkshp> Can I have a tiger?
[23:41:25] <CuriosTiger> That would be up to your local authorities, not to me. But in the UK, I believe the answer is "no, unless you own a zoo".
[23:41:58] <blkshp> I wanna be that guy that raises a tiger cub and 5 years later is seen by the tiger  and the tiger runs over and hugs!! lol whilst everyone else screams thinking i gonna be eaten by tiger :D! lol
[23:42:02] <CuriosTiger> (I don't have tigers, I just volunteered for years at a sanctuary. Vanishing Species Wildlife.)
[23:42:25] <CuriosTiger> blkshp: Someone in London did that with lion cubs that were later released in Africa, supposedly.
[23:42:34] <blkshp> Not quite sure why i wrote that like a 3 year old.
[23:42:46] <CuriosTiger> at least, that's the backstory they tell. But the lion hugs in the video are real enough.
[23:42:54] <blkshp> :D
[23:43:02] <CuriosTiger> blkshp: Because those kinds of fantasies are typically formed around that age?
[23:43:25] <blkshp> possibly, i could hear it in my head as i wrote it! 
[23:43:26] <CuriosTiger> When I was a toddler, I had plans to live in a BIG HOUSE when I grew up. It was going to be so big it had an elevator!
[23:43:31] <CuriosTiger> and I was going to have guard tigers out front

[23:43:50] <CuriosTiger> I had to go elsewhere for the tigers, but that dream never quite left me.
[23:44:21] <CuriosTiger> After a visit to Thailand in 2004 where I did that touristy "take your photo with a tiger", I stuck around and played with a cub for about an hour.
[23:44:39] <CuriosTiger> The staff warned me I would get scratched and bitten if I stayed in the enclosure after the cub finished her bottle of milk.
[23:44:58] <CuriosTiger> but they allowed me to, and they allowed me to feed her her real food (mincemeat at that age)
[23:45:09] <CuriosTiger> I got bitten. I got scratched. But I had an awesome time.

[23:46:10] <CuriosTiger> so when I later moved to Florida, I looked for volunteer opportunities. Glutton for punishment, I suppose.
[23:46:13] <blkshp> My friend has a ginger tom cat that scratches and bites when playing. apparently im the only one that he claws to death while still playing everyone else stops when they get a little scratch
[23:46:25] <blkshp> I come out bleeding but the cat has fun and so do I lol
[23:46:35] <CuriosTiger> that's all that matters. :)
[23:47:00] <blkshp> he's a stalker you know when you put your hand up
[23:47:15] <CuriosTiger> This is why they tell us never to turn your back on a big cat.
[23:47:46] <CuriosTiger> I've broken the rule a couple of times. And been pounced on. A couple of times, I've turned around and caught a cat mid-pounce
[23:47:47] <blkshp> certainly not! i have had cats jump at my back after playing them up, if it was a big one... death!
[23:47:56] <CuriosTiger> they don't know what to do when the "prey" turns around mid-pounce.
[23:47:58] <CuriosTiger> it confuses them. :P
[23:48:20] <blkshp> :D
[23:48:26] <CuriosTiger> blkshp: My worst one -- which actually scared me -- was when someone pulled my leg.
[23:48:29] <CuriosTiger> Literally.
[23:48:41] <CuriosTiger> I looked down and saw my leg just disappear into the mouth of a lioness.
[23:48:48] <blkshp> :O
[23:48:49] <CuriosTiger> Luckily for me, she was just being playful.

[23:49:20] <CuriosTiger> if she had chomped, I'd have a broken leg at a minimum -- and once you're disabled, instinct tends to kick in, no matter how loving and sweet the animal was a minute earlier.
[23:49:47] <CuriosTiger> I threw a ball. She let go and chased the ball like a 450 lb golden retriever.
[23:49:58] <CuriosTiger> no damage, but it did scare me.
[23:50:39] <blkshp> ow! and yeah, i can imagine it would

[23:51:29] <CuriosTiger> No actual pain. She just pulled, she didn't bite. But that's...luck, really.
[23:51:47] <CuriosTiger> and you don't really want to rely on luck alone in these situations.
[23:56:45] <LuisP14> mm, cute
[23:58:14] * LuisP14 also continues playing, getting scratched and all
