[03:39:53] <bpalmer> because you're evaluating that inside a dynamically scoped buffer, almost certainly
[03:40:05] <bpalmer> elisp is traditionally and by default dynamically scoped
[03:40:38] <bpalmer> (setq f (let ((a 1)) (lambda () (+ a 2))))   <-- f is now a lambda. But it is not one that returns 3
[03:41:16] <bpalmer> when you call f , (funcall f) , it will look up what the *current* binding for a is. Thus, (funcall f) by itself is an error; (let ((a 7)) (funcall f))  will evaluate to 9
[03:42:04] <bpalmer> This is an unusual scoping behavior compared to newer languages, which only support lexical scoping.
[03:43:20] <bpalmer> You can enable lexical scoping in emacs by having -*- lexical-binding: t -*- at the top of a .el file ; see (info "(elisp) Lexical Binding") and (info "(elisp) Using Lexical Binding")
[03:43:34] <Common-Lisp> I wish more languages had dynamic binding because it is extremely funny
[03:43:53] *** Quits: atw (~user@ool-18bf5678.dyn.optonline.net) (Remote host closed the connection)
[03:44:19] <technomancy> more language development needs to take humor into account
[03:44:24] <bpalmer> You can also 'fake' it using something like the lexical-let macro from cl.el:   (require 'cl)  (setq f (lexical-let ((a 2)) (lambda () (+ a 2))))   will produce a function that you can call: (funcall f)  and get 4
[03:44:29] <technomancy> letting golang have all the jokes just isn't fair

[03:45:20] <rudybot> bpalmer: anyway the funniest phrase in that page is "my commitment to Richard Stallman"
[03:45:26] <bosonbear> Interesting. So if I don't enable lexical scoping, what is elispy way to pass a varialbe that is defined outside the lambda function?

[03:46:30] <bpalmer> well, globals are also great.
[03:46:58] <bpalmer> To a certain extent, that's how lexical-let does its work; it takes advantage of uninterned symbols
[03:47:14] <bpalmer> to provide  a "global" value but one which will go away when unreferenced.
[03:47:15] <technomancy> rudybot: who's gone and made globals great again

[04:57:58] <technomancy> any suggestions?
[04:57:58] <johnjaye> The intention is for it to be minimal but also cross-platform with extra stuff loaded from other files.
[04:58:04] <technomancy> stop using github =D
[04:58:04] <johnjaye> i just haven't worked out what those should be
[04:58:15] <johnjaye> aha well i did make a gitlab account. guess i should use that
[04:58:16] <technomancy> lol
[04:58:35] <technomancy> well... I support moving off github but I think gitlab will make you sad
[04:58:51] <johnjaye> perhaps
[04:58:53] <technomancy> codeberg is a lot less buggy if you don't like the sourcehut vibe
[04:59:07] <johnjaye> the two main things to note are that i have advanced functions separated into the second half
[04:59:16] <johnjaye> that way if there's debugging to be done it can be easily checked first
[04:59:27] <technomancy> that's smart, yeah
[04:59:32] <johnjaye> and i have some code at the end that enhances show-paren-mode to show 2 levels of parens
[04:59:41] <johnjaye> that's the only really amazing thing here.
[04:59:43] <technomancy> wow you have some emacs 22 compatibility, that's dedication =D
[05:00:03] <johnjaye> haha i think i read that on emacswiki maybe
[05:00:37] <johnjaye> also some of this stuff i copied like the python section
[05:00:41] <technomancy> on line 79 the cond could maybe be a case
[05:00:54] <technomancy> since you're dispatching off the same value every time
[05:01:24] <johnjaye> ah ok. yeah i thought there was no elisp equivalent to a switch statement
[05:01:33] <johnjaye> so i went to scheme which is the first lisp i learned
[05:02:01] <technomancy> why do you hide the menu bar only if you're in prog-mode?
[05:02:04] <markofcorn> technomancy: can I ask why the opposition to github? Too monolithic or is it a privacy thing or what
[05:02:51] <technomancy> monopoly ... bad
[05:02:59] <technomancy> it's not complicated =)
[05:03:58] <johnjaye> oh for minimalism purposes. but i realized it would be kind of weird to just open emacs and have no menus or modeline or... anything
[05:04:37] *** Joins: AimHere (~David@92.238.16.159)
[05:04:41] <johnjaye> so that was the compromise
[05:04:57] <technomancy> wait you turn off the modeline too?
[05:05:08] <technomancy> no.
[05:05:30] <johnjaye> oh i don't think so. but doom totally revamps the modeline with some minor mode so it is an option
[05:05:40] <johnjaye> it's like no-modeline-mode or something
[05:05:42] <technomancy> didn't even know that was possible, huh
[05:05:49] <markofcorn> fair enough. I'm not opposed to moving away from github once I stop needing it for school. Looked into self hosting something like gitea for awhile but then I was like "what if I wanna share my dotfiles or fork another project and make a pull request"
[05:06:26] <markofcorn> Mostly the second thing, lets be honest, I'm not going out of my way to share my spaghetti dotfiles
[05:06:26] <technomancy> markofcorn: gitea got funded to add features to allow pull requests from federated sources so that should be coming
[05:06:37] <technomancy> but also you can just send people patches
[05:06:51] <technomancy> you don't need to make an account on the same site to contribute
[05:07:03] <Common-Lisp> If gitea gets federated PRs before GitLab does I'll eat my shoe
[05:07:09] <Common-Lisp> and probably delete my GitLab account
[05:07:17] <technomancy> Common-Lisp: honestly it wouldn't surprise me at all
[05:07:18] <Common-Lisp> (Although I have mostly switched to Sourcehut these days anyway, for new projects)
[05:07:19] <markofcorn> Oh thats pretty cool. So then if I wanna fork something do I just clone it and push it onto my own repo?

[05:10:40] <Common-Lisp> yeah it does if you use email

[05:10:52] <Common-Lisp> lol
[05:10:59] <johnjaye> not sure why i added that. maybe so it's obvious in the messages buffer?
[05:11:32] <technomancy> Common-Lisp: solved it by yelling at people who break the norms. I'm sympathetic to people who see their behavior and are like "fuck that" tbh
[05:11:37] <technomancy> even tho I love it for my own personal use
[05:12:38] <Common-Lisp> I give Sourcehut a lot of credit for being literally the only actively developed forge that support Mercurial

[05:15:02] <markofcorn> markofcorn Maybe I just need better friends haha
[05:15:05] <johnjaye> basically you do a dirty hack to set message-log-max to nil. then append the propertized text directly
[05:15:09] <markofcorn> i mean technomancy lmao
[05:15:19] <johnjaye> that way i can put color status messages. e.g.
[05:15:31] <johnjaye> (message-status "fci-mode.el load" (if (load "fci" t) 1 -1))
[05:15:46] <johnjaye> if successfull it prints a green character if not prints a red one

[06:16:41] <technomancy> the stupidest thing about screen is it binds C-a as its prefix key

[06:17:22] <johnjaye> good point. i was afraid to rebind it though because emacs

[06:18:25] <johnjaye> probably bash has some way to make a function that enters a character. not sure
[06:18:43] <johnjaye> then you could say make b the prefix key. and then have a bash thing that inserts b on a different key stroke
[06:19:17] <johnjaye> dunno if bash can do that or if you'd have to fiddle with ssh or termcap
[06:19:19] <Sketch> i've used screen for so long i'm used to typing C-a a when i want beginning-of-line anyway, so i just set tmux to use C-a

[22:01:21] <corwin> Garun: if you are happy with WSL then you are likely to be learning some stuff for the community as you work though stuff.  My experience is that MSYS/MinGW and Cyg provide a more reliable/predictable unix-under-windows experience, especially WRT to having Emacs "just work".

[22:04:41] <corwin> I'm thinking of WSL2, I'm just being lazy.  Sorry if that's resulting in confusion.

[22:07:48] <corwin> It's the VM thing that I'm probably objecting to.  Windows is barely performent as is, adding additional layers makes (especially Emacs) basically unusable.  Acknowledging (once again) that I may be jaded.

[22:10:01] <TRS-80> Garun: I am reading your Reddit post.  Maybe you (or anyone) can answer a question I have always had.  I don't get the appeal of 'handwritten notes' unless we are talking about diagrams or something like Newton/Picasso's notebook.  In my mind anyway, that loses you one of the main benefits of plain text which is searchability.  What am I missing?
[22:10:03] <corwin> Garun: I'm a solutions architect focused on Web sites and enterprise platforms for building same.  AFAIK none of our dev teams do much of anything with Powershell but some of the system admins occasionally do, in context of "cloud" infrastructure mgmt.

[22:14:33] <TRS-80> Garun: Why not just run GNU/Linux?
[22:15:49] <Garun> TRS-80: I feel like window is here to stay, so I don't want to abandon window. Also there are lots of third party apps that window support best.
[22:16:16] <TRS-80> grym: I guess I don't annotate that many PDFs.  To me I'd rather have quotes and citations directly in my notes.  But I guess it's different if you are for example citing a lot of academic papers or whatever.
[22:16:39] <Garun> TRS-80: to be honest, I also never use window apps, but, when I need it, I don't think it can be replace with Linux distro.

[22:46:30] <chipps__> I installed evil, and if I'm in normal mode in the *Buffer List* buffer, how do I get to the respective buffers from there? Without evil I can just press return
[22:47:01] <TRS-80> Garun: Not sure what you mean by 'take notes on a webpage' and I don't know what hypothesis.is is, (<- Bill Clinton? lol) but I suppose this is why I just take notes in Emacs.  Some times with simple copy paste, even by mouse if neccessary (gasp!).

[22:48:55] <Garun> rpav: when writing things down in your own word, you detach from a raw source. Summarizing things helps remember and learn better for sure, but, in those rare cases where you don't have enough knowledge to properly summarize a context. Its best to have a way to get back to the original context. (delay the learing process, but still capture important information that you know you will need in the future, but you are not yet ready to
[22:48:55] <Garun> learn them at the time.)

[22:49:26] <rpav> not really the answer to the question
[22:49:33] <rpav> "why use a webpage" vs emacs/etc
[22:50:05] <johnjaye> let's do all notes in json
[22:50:18] <TRS-80> +1 what rpav said
[22:50:38] <johnjaye> annotation on a webpage is something i've wanted for a long time
[22:50:49] <johnjaye> i don't know why such things are so difficult for Big Tech to understand
[22:51:03] <johnjaye> but i can't even find extensions that do it either
[22:51:13] <Garun> rpav: when reading notes on a webpage, I want notes to be "close" to the webpage I make notes on. Its not really "taking note on a webpage" literally.
[22:51:22] <TRS-80> johnjaye: they are not, and they don't care about what anyone other than themselves want, and this is why we can't have nice things
[22:51:27] <johnjaye> ^
[22:51:35] <rpav> big tech probably has more interest in the set of what they want users to have rather than the set of what users might find useful
[22:51:40] <johnjaye> i'm sure someone into webdev could probably explain how to use select element tool to do this
[22:51:44] <johnjaye> but so far i dunno
[22:51:53] <rpav> Garun: oh i see
[22:51:59] <TRS-80> johnjaye: Which is why I essentially eschew all of that, and put my notes into something I do have control over, which is Emacs/Org Mode!  ;)
[22:52:01] <Garun> rpav: so the idea is to make notes on a page and have way to get back to the exact location of the content. I figure its like "taking note on a webpage"
[22:52:07] <johnjaye> e.g. if i read a long comment section and there's no URL anchors. i want to mark comment 227 as the last one i read so i can come back later
[22:52:08] <artefact> it sounds like a hard problem for any """modern""" web page
[22:52:13] <rpav> Garun: you're annotating, like johnjaye is talking about
[22:52:24] <artefact> like anything with "infinite scrolling" (what an awful pattern)
[22:52:27] <johnjaye> emacs has annotations. annotation.el very useful!

[22:53:13] <Garun> johnjaye: hypothesis.is solves the annotation problem you mentioned. you can also export its content which update given a fixed interval.

[22:53:17] <johnjaye> like www.gnu.org#gnuslashlinux
[22:53:48] <rpav> e.g. splitting things up into pages with page=N is "better" because browsers deal with that, and infinite scroll generally have poor URL handling and don't update to `page=N` _as they trivially could_
[22:54:07] <rpav> there's not really much of a technical difference between the two
[22:54:08] <TRS-80> Garun: And if you copied a snippet, you could also locate it in the original HTML with a plain text search.  In fact this may be what hypothesis is doing.  If I may hpyothesize.  :D
[22:54:30] <Garun> still hypothesis.is is an extension which we has little to no control over its non-intended behavior.

[22:55:23] <artefact> they don't know what control F is. they don't know about anchors, link rot, the concept of permanent links
[22:55:23] <johnjaye> yes the #sometext trick to a url doesn't seem to work on mobile browsers

[23:34:13] <technomancy> TRS-80: IMO microsoft is now amenable to open source because they realized that you can be pro-open-source without actually being pro-users-rights or pro-free-software.

[23:38:46] <technomancy> Catie: note that while I'm pretty bleh on "open source" I think going all-in on free software as defined by the FSF is at this point still woefully insufficient; any movement for software freedom that isn't founded on anti-capitalist principles at its core is toothless and doomed to be ineffective.

[23:39:28] <Catie> That's honestly been my biggest gripe about the FSF (well, maybe my biggest gripe) is that they _don't go far enough_
[23:39:30] <rpav> 🤔 given the current state of fsf _or_ open source development

[23:44:08] * TRS-80 just uses regular vanilla define-key
[23:44:08] <rpav> probably because define-key or global-set-key is how one ought to set keys

[23:48:19] <linj[m]> How long does it take to get a bug id reply after `report-emacs-bug`? 10 minutes have gone. I think it should not be that long, since it is automatic.
[23:49:14] <parsnip> i've seen it take days, maybe
[23:49:22] <Catie> Oh! No, I was making a joke off of Jeff Bezoar, like she had an entire Amazon CEO in her stomach kind of thing

[23:54:08] <markofcorn> Okay so this channel seems to really dislike general. But like how do you all feel about use-package's :bind function or something like (evil-define-key). Or do you all just write everything using define key and global set key?
[23:54:19] <parsnip> like, i feel like i've sent messages there that never showed up

[23:55:12] <parsnip> markofcorn: i find anything that's provided to make my config more convenience, but i have to install it before it starts working, is friction for troubleshooting my config
[23:55:49] <parsnip> if it's stable, or i find it particularly useful, i'll make a compromise
[23:56:15] <parsnip> once in a while i'll use bind-key, but i've just as frequently removed it
[23:56:45] <markofcorn> Hmm, so what about use-package? Aren't I loading bind-key anyway by loading use-package?
[23:56:58] <parsnip> i don't really use use-package

[23:57:55] <parsnip> i use an org-mode init occasionally, but on average i don't use it
[23:58:08] <linj[m]> parsnip: do you use ement.el btw
[23:58:32] <TRS-80> I am also in the 'less abstraction' camp, however adding lots of packages and 'starter kits' seems very popular for some reason (which I cannot fathom)
[23:58:53] <bremner> people want something cool, without work
[23:58:53] <parsnip> i don't think i've used it. maybe i tried it but the docs did not suffice to get me setup when i tried it
[23:59:24] <markofcorn> How do you all feel about straight then? I think straight is a different case since it replaces package.el rather than wrapping it
[23:59:25] <parsnip> in particular i don't want magic for "start up"
[23:59:38] <parsnip> i am begrudgingly using straight.el at the moment
[23:59:45] <TRS-80> markofcorn: I use vanilla package.el
[23:59:48] <parsnip> i wish i preferred something else right now
