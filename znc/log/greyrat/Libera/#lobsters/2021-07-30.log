[01:33:23] <technomancy> any complaints?
[01:33:24] <companion_cube> it's sometimes a bit annoying for shared stuff actually (like slack domains)

[01:33:55] <companion_cube> the other bad thing (on me) is that I use the same github account for my stuff and work stuff
[01:34:00] <companion_cube> so I have a separate container for that

[01:34:18] <technomancy> companion_cube: yeah, I could see that being a pain. I've moved 99% of my personal stuff off github so I'm not too worried.

[21:47:04] <companion_cube> I want more lockfiles in my life
[21:47:23] <technomancy> I hate the idea of "lockfile" as something that gets checked in

[21:48:16] <ignaloidas> they would be better called pinfiles
[21:48:18] <companion_cube> we've had this discussion, and you just write the lockfile yourself, it's not that different
[21:48:22] <ignaloidas> because they pin the version

[21:48:38] <technomancy> companion_cube: no, this is a different discussion =)
[21:48:40] <ngoldbaum> because they slap
[21:48:43] <technomancy> it's the naming I'm objecting to today
[21:48:53] <technomancy> ignaloidas is right; pinfile would have been better

[23:32:48] <ignaloidas> imode, increasing density in displays is a lot harder than increasing their granularity

[23:34:08] <ignaloidas> it's a lot easier to make circuitry that can change the LCD state to 2^10 positions than to fit a roughly equivalent number of pixels in the same space
[23:34:16] <ubitux> kline: i didn't try :)
[23:36:05] <imode> ignaloidas: I'm not sure what the relation is between density and granularity?
[23:36:18] <ignaloidas> imode, look up delta-sigma modulation
[23:36:59] <ignaloidas> basically, you can represent the same analog signal with many samples of small acuracy or less samples of high accuracy
[23:37:18] <imode> makes sense.
[23:37:38] <ignaloidas> e.g. DSD audio is 2MHz 1 bit, which works out to be roughly equivalent to 48Khz 16 bit
[23:37:50] <imode> but you're saying that it's harder to design displays that can do the former (i.e ultra-huge 1-bit displays) vs. a color display at a lower res?
[23:39:25] <ignaloidas> imode, yes, because making high density displays is more difficult than driving the pixels at higher accuracy
[23:39:37] <imode> mm.
[23:40:31] <ignaloidas> in the end, the pixels will have roughly the same structure either way, just that the drivers will be slightly more expensive for higher accuracy
[23:40:34] <imode> I don't quite believe that, but it's probably because I'm still stuck in thinking that you could do a 1-bit display at my current monitor res and I wouldn't care. :P
[23:41:12] <ignaloidas> and drivers do scale better since they get multiplexed for many pixels
[23:41:28] <ignaloidas> imode, you might not care, but many would
[23:41:29] <imode> perhaps we're talking about different things.
[23:42:33] <imode> I'm just talking about a literal 1-bit display, where each pixel is an individual bit. you're not sampling anything, there's no discretization or input signal that you have to quantize down, you aren't backing it all with a larger color palette.
[23:42:47] <imode> if you wanna map larger color spaces you'd have to do so in software.
[23:42:53] <imode> not hardware.
[23:43:23] <imode> so I don't buy that it's difficult to build large displays of a lower color capability, in fact I'd think it'd be easier because there's more than likely less actual circuitry.
[23:43:40] <imode> vs. the same display but at a higher color cap.
[23:44:23] <ignaloidas> imode, there are some high res monochrome LCD's used for 3D resin printing, they have about the same DPI
[23:44:45] <ignaloidas> circuitry is a lot cheaper than the LCD itself anyways
[23:44:51] <imode> ooo.
[23:45:09] <imode> I didn't even know 3D resin printing is a thing, got a link?
[23:45:17] <ignaloidas> and LCD is the same, weather you drive it as 1 bit, or as 16 bit
[23:45:47] <ignaloidas> imode, e.g. https://www.anycubic.com/products/anycubic-photon-3d-printer
[23:46:11] <ignaloidas> I was thinking of buying it because of the price, but resin is way too annoying to deal with
[23:47:13] <imode> is that UV cure?
[23:47:40] <ignaloidas> imode, yeah
[23:47:44] <imode> huh.
[23:47:49] <ignaloidas> the LCD displays the mask
[23:48:06] <ignaloidas> and some powerful UV LED's shine through
[23:48:13] <imode> ohhhh that's cool as hell.
[23:48:18] <ignaloidas> uses antialiasing as well
[23:48:32] <imode> so the actual panel doesn't have a backing, but the LEDs just shine through the unlit areas ("white").
[23:48:40] <imode> that's crazy, I love that idea.

[23:53:05] <imode> didn't know there was a video on it.
[23:53:47] <mgdm> A while ago I saw someone making a guitar pedal from homemade transistors
