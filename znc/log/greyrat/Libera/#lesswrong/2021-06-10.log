Keys went to a local supermarket to choose foods that would be inexpensive, but still be enough to provide energy. He purchased hard biscuits, dry sausages, hard candy, and
[01:35:00] <rmmh> chocolate bars. He then tested his 28-ounce (800-gram), 3,200-kilocalorie (13,000-kilojoule) meals on six soldiers in a nearby army base.

[02:54:19] <Logos01> spxtr: I don't believe Linux got that from bitkeeper.
[02:54:47] <Logos01> But instead from the actual master/slave model of data integrity.
[02:55:19] <spxtr> "This term came from Bitkeeper, a predecessor to Git. Bitkeeper referred to the source of truth as the "master repository" and other copies as "slave repositories"."
[02:55:33] <Logos01> spxtr: That's the quote, yes. 
[02:55:36] <spxtr> ok
[02:55:53] <Logos01> But Linux Torvolds wrote git from scratch due to his dissatisfaction with the existing code version control solutions out there.
[02:56:09] <Logos01> In particular IIRC his irascibility with CVS.
[02:56:49] <Logos01> So I could see why people would draw the comparison with bitkeeper because bitkeeper outright named things in the quite conventional data integrity model of master/slave network architecture.
[02:57:17] <Logos01> And because Linus used the same model.  But it was hardly Bitkeeper that came up with the naming convention. It was and is industry-standard across many infrastructural components.
[02:57:35] <spxtr> I agree that it was an industry-standard term.

[03:13:57] <Logos01> Well, the "master/slave" origin of git is *itself* a rewrite of history.
[03:14:04] <Logos01> So turnabout is fair play?

[05:01:09] <nshepperd> i love it when red hat forces everyone to remove support for stuff so i need to throw my printer in the garbage
[05:02:56] <quanticle> "In theory, almost all printers made in the last ten years should support IPP Everywhere. It seems that most do, even though the list of certified printers is conspicuously missing a number of vendors. But not everybody has a printer that recent; printers can stay around for a long time. The removal of printer drivers from CUPS (and the distributions using it) means the removal of support for
[05:02:58] <quanticle> all of those devices. It is fair to say that doesn't sit well with the owners of such hardware. The intended solution to this problem is "printer applications": programs that can speak to a certain class of printers while implementing the IPP Everywhere protocol to connect those printers to CUPS."
[05:03:00] <quanticle> Ah yes, the Fedora way: take something that's somewhat janky but *working*, promise to replace it with a "cleaner", "more elegant" solution, and then immediately start introducing new jank, in the form of backwards compatibility shims.
[05:03:44] <quanticle> While simultaneously *also* forcing everyone to change their workflows, config scripts, etc etc.
[05:03:47] <nshepperd> more like a cleaner more elegant solution that no-one will bother to actually implement for your hardware
[05:04:33] <nshepperd> they'll be like "haha, nobody uses your printer though, so we can't justify the dev time sorry lol"
[05:05:30] <saturn2> you can bet the elegant solution will also be too complicated for anyone outside red hat to understand
[05:06:51] <nshepperd> RiversHaveWings: i dunno if it's better, it just seemed like the simplest way to retrofit clip embeddings into the unconditional model
[05:09:40] <saturn2> "In a related issue, some participants in the discussion expressed concerns that some IPP Everywhere devices work by routing print jobs through cloud-based services. Indeed, the Android print dialog, when printing to the above-mentioned Brother printer, warns that the document may pass through third-party servers ‚Äî something that does not appear to actually happen in this case.

[05:25:54] <adiabatic> quanticle: it'll be plugged in all the time. I'd rather something that's plugged in all the time be plugged into the back where I don't see the cable.

[05:26:25] <adiabatic> USB ports are on the back of the iMac still
[05:26:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> And, conversely, making a phone more useful for me or anyone else here would make it unusable for the aforesaid people
[05:27:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> The only option - the *only* one - is to make just one kind of these powerful devices and use all that power to present a dumb, lowest-common-denominator UI

[05:33:02] <adiabatic> I would not have guessed they'd have _that_ different of guts based on (just?) USB port count, or anything else that is associated with it.

[06:54:43] *** Joins: adiabatty (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic)
[06:55:55] <gwern> when does he become the monster? I mean, it seems like you'd have to date that to at least as early as the beerhall putsch
[06:55:59] <brand0> hitler didn't exist in a vacuum either, he rode a whole wave of right wingers and nationalists, so would killing hitler even have the desired effect?
[06:56:31] <feep> I mean
[06:56:36] <feep> try it and see?
[06:56:45] <gwern> difficult to see how it could go any worse

[06:57:22] <brand0> it's either that feep or someone ends up having sex with their grandmother
[06:57:22] <feep> and he's dead because ... killing him was a good idea and so it wasn't reverted
[06:57:36] <feep> it was just good, no excuses

[07:00:10] <Kol> would global dynamics in 2020 be as 'stable' without ww2? was ww2 inevitable even without hitler?
[07:01:11] <brand0> you can kill hitler or not, but there's still the other half of WW2 which is the american-japanese war ... that had been brewing for decades

[09:33:13] <Mark_> (ctrl+shift+v, besides requiring one more modifier, which is inefficient, is already used by special pastes, pasting in terminal emulators, etc.)
[09:33:45] <adiabatic> isn't 'win with pudding' impressive enough on its own?
[09:33:56] <adiabatic> I've never puddinged in nethack
[09:34:06] <Mark_> (ctrl+alt+v requires one more modifier, otherwise I don‚Äôt think it conflicts)
[09:35:05] <Mark_> (using command, if you don‚Äôt switch it to ctrl, is then automatically inconsistent with anything other than macos which is terrible for muscle memory)
[09:35:57] <adiabatic> it's surprisingly not a problem because looking at Windows, even if you're on a Mac keyboard, puts you in use-ctrl mode most of the time

[09:37:42] <Mark_> spxtr: you may want instant feedback when cutting text
[09:38:39] <spxtr> it's a stretch, but I suppose
[09:38:43] <Mark_> DEs with toolkits that use ctrl+shift+z for undo should probably use ctrl+y instead for the same efficiency reason... though they support ctrl+y already anyway, but it is what they should mention in their documentation
[09:39:13] <spxtr> who uses ctrl-shift-z for undo? did you mean redo?
[09:39:36] <spxtr> or do you mean terminals where ctrl-z is a signal?
[09:39:39] <Mark_> yes
[09:39:45] <Mark_> yes, meant redo
[09:40:10] <adiabatic> ctrl-shift-z makes total sense, though. shift means reverse in a lot of contexts and you can go backwards and forwards easily by pressing or not pressing shift
[09:40:15] <Mark_> of course supporting ctrl+shift+z is good, since on qwerty you use the right hand for the modifiers and the left hand when typing y and you sometimes undo and then decide that you want to redo quickly, and it is better if you do not need to change your right hand‚Äôs position
[09:40:16] <spxtr> yeah, I always have to look up the redo shortcuts, kinda bothersome
[09:40:59] <Mark_> s/the right hand for the modifiers and the left hand when typing y/the right hand for the modifiers when typing z and the left hand for the modifiers when typing y/
[09:41:08] <spxtr> ctrl-shift-z is also super easy to type, since they're all like right there next to each other
[09:42:38] <Mark_> I suppose there‚Äôs also the fact that you press y with your index finger, on qwerty
[09:43:36] <adiabatic> ‚Ä¶of your mousing hand, in many cases
[09:43:57] <Mark_> you already use the mousing hand to press ctrl if you use ctrl+shift+z
[09:44:09] <spxtr> no I don't
[09:44:24] <adiabatic> I don't
[09:44:31] <spxtr> I don't even have a ctrl key on the right
[09:45:20] <spxtr> thumb on ctrl, pinky on shift, ring finger on z
[09:45:30] <spxtr> bit awkward when I think about it, but it feels completely natural
[09:46:44] <Mark_> I think the case for using a single hand is stronger with ctrl+c, ctrl+x, ctrl+v, since these are far more often used with the mouse in-between
[09:47:01] <Mark_> but for undo and redo? better to alternate hands for modifiers
[09:47:16] <spxtr> that's true, very natural to click, ctrl-c, click, ctrl-v
[09:47:45] <spxtr> even better to select, middle click :)

My mother is also a huge B5 fan so she sat down to watch with me a bit... the episode was "Signs and Portents" ...
[10:30:04] <Obormot\Gaia> Logos01: And we got to the end, where Lady Ladira telepathically shows Sinclair her prophetic vision of B5 being blown up and my mother's like ... "Hmm, that must be where his schizophrenia came from" :x

[10:33:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> As in ... more obviously CG

[10:34:04] <feep[work]> to me b5 already looks p much maximally cg
[10:34:05] <Logos01> Well the problem is that it *wasn't* rerendered.

Some folks from work wanted to have an outdoor get-together, because I was the newbie and no one had seen me IRL until that point. We arranged to meet at a local park, and I knew the time and the approximate location, but when I arrived, I realized that the parking lot was big enough that it would be possible for all of us to miss each other. I
[11:57:59] <quanticle> also realized that I didn't have the phone numbers of any of my co-workers, so I couldn't text them where I was either, since until then, all our communication had been over Slack. I thought about installing Slack, but then I noticed that the parking lot had a big sign with the name of the park. I just stood by the sign and waited, and sure enough everyone gathered there.

[12:02:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> Speaking of stories, my mother told me a new one the other day
[12:04:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> So this was back when my grandfather was stationed in Siberia... my grandparents and my mother lived in a small city way out east, and at one point my mother took a trip to visit one of her aunts (my grandfather's sisters) in Moldova
[12:07:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> And while my mother was in Kishinev visiting her aunt, she figured that it'd be nice to send a present back to her parents: some pears (her aunt had a pear tree - needless to say you could not buy fresh pears in a small town out in the middle of frozen nowhere), and also some candy (Kishinev, being a big city, had big fancy stores with all kinds of candy, whereas the aforesaid small town in Siberia had exactly one (1) kind of
[12:07:42] <Obormot\Arcturus>  hard candy you could buy and nothing else)

[12:11:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> So she went out shopping with her aunt, they bought a big pile of various candies, they picked some nice juicy pears, and they packed it all up for shipping by post. Packed it up, mind you, *very thoroughly*: my mother's uncle got a big wooden crate, they put all the pears and candies in there, all packed up and padded nicely; they put the lid on the crate; they nailed the lid to the crate; they used a hand saw to saw notches
[12:11:10] <Obormot\Arcturus>  into the crate boards (!) for lengths of twine to fit into; they wrapped the crate with the twine; and then they used hot wax to seal the wrapped and tied up twine.
[12:11:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> And my mother took the package to the post office and sent it off to my grandparents.

[12:13:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> My mother is like "oh, great, glad to hear, and did you like the candies?"
[12:13:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> "???"
[12:14:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> "What candies...?" asks my grandmother
[12:15:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> "The ... candies I sent?" "Um, there were no candies in the box." "... but the pears were there?" "Yes..." "And the crate was sealed?" "Yes..." "Nailed shut? Wrapped with twine?? Sealed with wax??!" "Yes, yes, and yes..."
[12:16:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> Of course the whole point of this thorough packing and sealing was that mailing things by post in the Soviet Union *did* often result in them getting stolen in transit...

[12:19:41] <nshepperd> wow
[12:20:15] <quanticle> Obormot\Arcturus: Alternate explanation: the postal worker's job was to inspect packages, he unsealed the package in the process of looking for contraband and well... he interpreted the definition of "contraband" to include the candies that your mother was sending

[20:25:10] <kuudes> maybe the golfer had been vaccinated. many such cases

[20:25:26] <two2thehead> maybe the xmen are involved
[20:25:55] <two2thehead> the conspiracy is that it makes you magnetic (magnito) so maybe the lightening is Storm's work
[20:26:01] <gwern> two2thehead: but not the much sexier xymen, although both involve strange genetics
[20:29:00] <ggreer> is there a way to make someone prone to lightning strikes? I guess if you could nudge them to go to the top of things?

[20:32:48] <gwern> 'Control systems are powerful. Before I fully understood this, it seemed suspicious that Covid-19 was in a nightmarish range of virulence and lethality. Under that theory, if Covid-19 had been more virulent it would have been impossible to stop and we‚Äôd have all gotten it and moved on, if it had been less lethal we would have chosen not to stop it, and if it had been less virulent or more...
[20:32:54] <gwern> ...lethal we would have stopped it. So under this model, there weren‚Äôt that many configurations of (virulence, lethality) that would be worse than what we got unless both variables were much higher. With a better appreciation for control systems, it is now clear that the range of configurations that result in ‚Äòwe adjust to remain stuck in limbo for a year‚Äô was remarkably large. There...
[20:33:00] <gwern> ...were a lot of knobs humans could turn to contain things, and they could do so at different prevalence levels based on lethality. It would take quite a lot to fully break that equilibrium in either direction, and that did not happen until the vaccines showed up.'
[20:35:37] <ggreer> I do wonder how much longer the restrictions would have lasted if no vaccines or treatments had shown up
[20:36:30] <gwern> I kind of imagine it as sort of like a sigmoid on a yoyo. restrictions decay until death rates spike, control system clamps down, it goes back down to a low but higher plateau, and so on repeatedly until herd immunity
[20:37:18] <gwern> I was also watching kara no kyoukai last night and to my disappoint the next episode brings in the whole nasuverse stuff about maguses and the clocktower and their typical mad-science, but it did remind me of 'Counter-Force' and I'm amused at how identical 'Counter-Force' is to 'Control System' in these discussions

[22:52:04] <shawwwn> but of course they can't say that
[22:52:13] <shawwwn> imagine being the one troop to shout out "We can't hear you sir!"

[22:56:14] <shawwwn> maybe. but I feel like their super hearing would have to be canon
[22:56:24] <shawwwn> they'd have to make a big deal about it in the show
[22:56:49] <shawwwn> in the movie, there's a scene where the main ninja character fights against a blind samurai. and the samurai seemed to be able to hear much better than him
[22:57:02] <shawwwn> so apparently even ninjas have limits
[22:57:21] <gwern> yes, so supernaturally better he is able to fight jubei equally. but that's not to say that jubei doesn't hear like a cat. that's just entrance stakes
