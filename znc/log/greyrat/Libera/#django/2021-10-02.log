[05:50:23] <FunkyBob> pardon?
[05:50:55] <rannnn8888> FunkyBob its other problem in the url i need delete before the migrate

[05:52:53] <FunkyBob> well, yo usaid "i fix this', so I took it to mean ... you had fixed that.
[05:53:55] <rannnn8888> FunkyBob this what i work with you in the past https://dpaste.org/y0sm
[05:54:18] <rannnn8888> the trunc make the its a datetype yes ?
[05:55:07] *** Quits: Kalov (~Thunderbi@179.56.68.20) (Quit: Kalov)
[05:55:33] <FunkyBob> from a quick look at the docs, it should take a date or datetime, and yield the same
[05:56:12] <FunkyBob> (or time)
[05:59:59] <rannnn8888> k and have way make this more fast :X  ? its take me like 5-6 sec after i add index before take 15 sec
[06:02:09] <rannnn8888> FunkyBob this the mdle https://dpaste.org/jvrx
[06:04:34] <rannnn8888> this my index order maybe can use this
[06:04:34] <rannnn8888>  on news (Symbol,timestamp,Fllll,team,stats)
[06:09:24] <FunkyBob> does EXPLAIN show your query is using that index?
[06:09:28] <FunkyBob> is that the only index you have?
[06:09:43] <FunkyBob> I reckon a major problem is having TextField for almost everything
[06:09:58] <FunkyBob> which might make all your indices useless
[06:13:54] <rannnn8888> FunkyBob I think the query here first fint use the timestamp and after the symbole ? this first problem to the time no ?
[06:14:01] <rannnn8888> Symbol
[06:14:34] <rannnn8888> and what the problem with the TextField  ? its all text
[06:16:59] <rannnn8888> for the example symbol no need be textfield ? Symbol = models.TextField(null=True, blank=True)
[06:19:55] *** Joins: rje (~rje@50.35.241.164)
[06:19:58] <FunkyBob> rannnn8888: but you want to treat it like datetimes... so it's NOT all text
[06:20:20] <FunkyBob> ah, wait, I misread
[06:20:46] <FunkyBob> but in your query you _do_ cast timestamp to a datetime... why?
[06:20:54] <FunkyBob> https://dpaste.org/y0sm#L11,12,13,14
[06:21:19] <FunkyBob>                     .annotate(Fllll_as_float=Cast('Fllll', output_field=FloatField()), )
[06:21:29] <FunkyBob> and you cast fllll as a float... why isn't it a float to begin with?
[06:23:08] <FunkyBob> your DBMS can do its job better if you tell it the truth
[06:23:09] <rannnn8888> FunkyBob yes in the last time you help me make this query the timestamp look like this timestamp = models.TextField(null=True, blank=True)
[06:23:16] <rannnn8888> and i fix this
[06:23:30] <FunkyBob> rannnn8888: yes, but you didn't fix your query
[06:23:42] <FunkyBob> so now it's doing pointless extra work... work that will make it likely unable to use the index
[06:23:49] <rannnn8888> yes this why i send it here again
[06:25:13] <rannnn8888> https://bpa.st/DV7Q
[06:25:35] <FunkyBob>             queryset = qs
[06:25:36] <rannnn8888> i try soomething like this but the count i get wrong
[06:25:36] <FunkyBob> why?
[06:25:52] <rannnn8888> its give me all the same count
[06:25:53] <rannnn8888> 1
[06:26:05] <FunkyBob> yes
[06:26:11] <FunkyBob> because you're asking it to group by Symbol
[06:26:32] <FunkyBob> values('timestamp').annotate(count=Count('Symbol'))
[06:26:36] <rannnn8888> and in the first its by by the timestamp ?
[06:26:47] <FunkyBob> check the SQL it generates, too
[06:26:52] <FunkyBob> no not "first time"
[06:26:55] <rannnn8888> first = t https://dpaste.org/y0sm
[06:26:56] <FunkyBob> there's only one grouping
[06:27:43] <FunkyBob> that paste is still casting timestamp
[06:27:55] <FunkyBob> it's hard enough to read as it is without pointless extra work ... clean it up
[06:27:56] <FunkyBob> try again
[06:28:00] <FunkyBob> i'm out for a bit...

[13:16:53] <pycode> FunkyBob, i cant use {% static %} on .js file i suppose because i mean images, js, css will be served by nginx then
[13:17:09] <pycode> i cant use django tags on those files i suppose
[13:20:22] <pycode> FunkyBob, do you mean that i can set the url the template so  the other include js file will read that variable with the correct static url ?
[13:21:05] <pycode> var static_url = "{% static %}" or something is referring to the static_url on settings and then all the other included .js files will read that var
[13:23:59] <pycode> in js for example i have
[13:24:00] <pycode> navText: ["<img src='/static/frontend/img/owl-arrow.fw.png'/>", "<img src='/static/frontend/img/owl-arrow.fw.png'/>"],
[13:24:11] <pycode> i must replace them somehow
[13:26:48] <pycode> FunkyBob, what you said is ok for template... but if you include .js file from your templates and you also have some static refer from there how do you change that url?
[13:27:09] <pycode> i think i must declare inside a main.js (for example) all the settings for other js files

[13:57:40] <pycode> FunkyBob, still there?
[13:58:38] <wez> pycode: You use template tags on templates.  If it is being served by a CDN / static then it isn't a template.
[13:59:07] <pycode> wez, no wait.... i have .html templates and from those templates i include .js files..
[13:59:17] <pycode> js/csS/img are served from nginx
[13:59:26] <wez> You would need to define a url / route that uses a view to render the template
[13:59:27] <pycode> so i cant use {%static%}
[14:00:09] <pycode> wez, i know how to render i mean, if a js file need to access the static i need to replace the url from there too
[14:00:10] <wez> If you write a view for it and add it to your url routes then you can render anything from a template, including js
[14:01:53] <FunkyBob> pycode: oh, you had paths inside your JS file?  no, can't have django update that... use relative paths in them only
[14:02:49] <pycode> FunkyBob, yes i meant that
[14:02:53] <pycode> so i need to find a solution
[14:03:11] <pycode> because i have js files css images in project/static/{Here}
[14:03:29] <pycode> but then when i deploy that folder will be the root of static from nginx
[14:03:39] <pycode> so i think i must use an absolute path there
[14:03:42] <GinFuyou> if you need to pass STATIC_URL to js, you can render a JS var in template and access it in js files

[14:17:40] <pycode> if i use relative i should "skip" the static folder
