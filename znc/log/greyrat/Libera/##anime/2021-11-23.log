[05:14:19] <Jason_Waterfalls> oh okay
[05:14:33] <Jason_Waterfalls> i won't spoil anything, just that i think people are exaggerating when they seriously hate on it
[05:15:25] <Jason_Waterfalls> like, is it as good as the anime? well obviously not. but is it dogshit? no, not at all
[05:15:38] <ButterNoodle> I'm an connoisseur of anime.. and can tell u its not shit
[05:15:41] <Jason_Waterfalls> and it's above and beyond something like the netflix deathnote 
[05:15:43] <Jason_Waterfalls> yeah totally
[05:15:45] <ButterNoodle> I mean all live actions
[05:15:50] <Jason_Waterfalls> right
[05:16:14] <ButterNoodle> really many things fail to meet the expectations of the source material for the mouth breathers and neck beards
[05:16:20] <Jason_Waterfalls> of course
[05:16:53] <ButterNoodle> so as far as live action adaptations... maybe 9 out of 10...
[05:16:57] <Jason_Waterfalls> but i liked it more than the live action FMA
[05:17:04] <amigojapan> It's hard to make a good live action
[05:17:04] <Jason_Waterfalls> well, maybe as live action adaptations go
[05:17:15] <ButterNoodle> and that says a lot considering its netflix in a post cuties world
[05:17:20] <Jason_Waterfalls> i did not like it as much as the live action adaptation of 'kiss him not me'.. was a masterpiece 
[05:17:28] <ButterNoodle> oh
[05:17:31] <Jason_Waterfalls> lol
[05:17:31] <ButterNoodle> havent seen that
[05:17:40] <ButterNoodle> the anime was good
[05:18:04] <Jason_Waterfalls> lol the live action is just okay imo. was half-joke
[05:18:32] <Jason_Waterfalls> oh, i actually love the live action great teacher onizuka, though. it might be my favorite anime adaptation
[05:18:50] <Jason_Waterfalls> and i like the rurouni kenshin one
[05:19:05] <ButterNoodle> ofc
[05:19:15] <ButterNoodle> kenshin live was real good
[05:19:20] <Jason_Waterfalls> but anyway, about cowboy bebop, i've seen soooo much worse. i didn't care about almost any of the changes they made
[05:19:29] <ButterNoodle> I watch too much anime to re-hash it in live action tho
[05:19:34] <Jason_Waterfalls> agreed
[05:20:08] <ButterNoodle> bebop has been a long time cumming.. I just wanted to see if netflix fucked it up terribly.. and I was pleasantly surprised 
[05:20:21] <Jason_Waterfalls> so, without trying to spoil too much, there is one villain in netflix bebop i think they should have just left out and it felt kinda crammed in. they could have used that time for something else
[05:20:26] <Jason_Waterfalls> lol long time cumming
[05:20:44] <Jason_Waterfalls> yeah, i went into it thinking it was going to be like netflix deathnote
[05:21:05] <Jason_Waterfalls> which already had a live action adaption which was so-so
[05:22:33] <Jason_Waterfalls> amigojapan:  also you are right. cartoons often just don't translate that well. i think that's why Radical Edward is having some haters right now
[05:23:34] <ButterNoodle> naa 
[05:24:00] <Jason_Waterfalls> although there was space jam, and that was a masterpiece
[05:25:10] <ButterNoodle> if netflix never mentioned anything about ed being trans no one would have said a word... 
[05:27:13] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: wow, they said she is trans?

[06:24:11] <MootPoot> just blocks of substance
[06:26:25] <amigojapan> Jason_Waterfalls: also it is a rare anime about an old man
[06:26:37] <Jason_Waterfalls> i was reading that

[06:26:57] <Jason_Waterfalls> i love tofu
[06:27:14] <amigojapan> Yeah Jason_Waterfalls 
[06:27:24] <MootPoot> amigojapan: that dosent fix anything
[06:27:37] <Jason_Waterfalls> has an intriguing premise

[06:28:14] <ButterNoodle> boy libera is shit
[06:28:15] <amigojapan> I like momendoufu
[06:28:18] <MootPoot> it dosen't have anything to do with the style really
[06:28:24] <MootPoot> unless you just blend it in
[06:28:41] <MootPoot> to become filler volume
[06:29:08] <Jason_Waterfalls> the thing about tofu is that it tends to absorb the flavors of the things cooked with it. it doesn't have much flavor on its own
[06:29:16] <Jason_Waterfalls> but when fried with teriyaki sace or something, is pretty good
[06:29:18] <MootPoot> that's the problem
[06:29:20] <MootPoot> it dosent do that
[06:29:22] <Jason_Waterfalls> *sauce
[06:29:34] <MootPoot> at best its only surface level flavour
[06:30:21] <MootPoot> no matter what you do
[06:30:51] <MootPoot> unless you mush it up as much as you can 
[06:31:03] <MootPoot> at which point its just filler
[06:31:08] <Jason_Waterfalls> i just cut it up into cubes and fry it
[06:31:17] <MootPoot> which is fine really - works as a pretty good filler
[06:31:17] <ButterNoodle> deep fry it
[06:32:51] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: how dumb of an idea is it to mix ECC and non ECC RAM
[06:32:55] <MootPoot> I dont really need ECC

[06:55:45] <MootPoot> 16gb of ddr4 is like 50 usd
[06:55:48] <PancakeMatsuri> ah, Corsair RAM, cost between $100 and $200

[06:58:16] <MootPoot> Like Australia
[06:58:26] <PancakeMatsuri> like 15%
[06:58:44] <MootPoot> But anyway a few years ago in 2017 when I built my ryzen 7 1700 system 
[06:58:46] <PancakeMatsuri> but I think that flew under the radar
[06:58:55] <MootPoot> 16g ram cost me about 85 usd
[06:59:26] <PancakeMatsuri> well, that was Corsair
[06:59:33] <MootPoot> And?
[06:59:44] <PancakeMatsuri> a bit more for quality
[06:59:50] <MootPoot> Unless you got some 5000mhz ram
[06:59:58] <MootPoot> Lol
[07:00:13] <MootPoot> Corsair isent some kind of Uber quality ram 
[07:00:46] <MootPoot> Just saying- they all buy their ram from SK Hynix, TSMC or Samsung anyways
[07:01:01] <PancakeMatsuri> well, $85 and $146 is too much of a difference
[07:01:25] <MootPoot> Sounds like you guys are getting fucked on delivery charges 
[07:01:31] <MootPoot> And taxes
[07:01:43] <PancakeMatsuri> Amazon delivery, sure

[07:03:28] <MootPoot> Assuming PB tech is a decent seller in NZ online 
[07:03:29] <RenAdjest> pornhub
[07:03:44] <MootPoot> You guys are overpaying by 30% 
[07:03:48] <MootPoot> Compared to USA prices 
[07:03:59] <PancakeMatsuri> more or less decent
[07:04:10] <MootPoot> Probably even worse with more flashy stuff like you got

I already paid for the registration, but I won't get the card and sticker unless I get it smog checked, and I'm pretty sure I'll need to replace the battery and do other stuff just to get it drivable to a smog check place.

[14:17:54] <tcsilver> me too
[14:18:15] <tcsilver> it had something to do with some of the holliwood deals
[14:18:20] <tcsilver> with the studios
[14:18:28] <tcsilver> remember all those cardio boxing tapes ?
[14:18:33] <tcsilver> I used to like those
[14:19:06] <tcsilver> when I was a kid I did a commercial with fox network and we got a recording of it on vhs and betamax ;D
[14:19:26] <tcsilver> it was award winning :3 I got the job because my aunt wored with fox as a producer
[14:19:27] <tcsilver> lol
[14:19:32] <tcsilver> my mom was in the video too
[14:19:39] <tcsilver> and my aunt almsot played my mom

[14:21:19] <tcsilver> wow
[14:21:35] <omero> betamax was so far superior to VHS
[14:22:00] <omero> from almost every aspect you could consider
[14:22:16] <tcsilver> can you tell me some about it ? was the resolution better ?
[14:22:44] <omero> yes. not only that... you could... well do things that VHS achieved only years later

[15:57:26] <amigojapan> What?
[15:57:28] <DunceCotus> back in the early post-cataclysm days
[15:57:43] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: well late 1800s there was worldwide flooding and 'fires'
[15:57:50] <DunceCotus> the fires some speculate to be beam weapons
[15:57:56] <DunceCotus> or from beams
[15:58:21] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: so they had to repopulate areas with orphans and they had to transport these orphans in trains
[15:58:50] <DunceCotus> 'they' being those who took power in the power vacuum left by the cataclysm that wiped out our previous global civilisation
[15:59:44] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: my uncle kept a very long family tree, and I remember up to coming from Lithuania and many changes in last name
[16:00:08] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: I think a lot of family trees are suspect
[16:00:21] <amigojapan> HMmm ok
[16:00:25] <DunceCotus> or some of those entries derive from the previous global civilisation 
[16:00:37] <DunceCotus> but in that civilisation people had a different way of relating to one another
[16:01:13] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: I liken it to a time of global mercantile-feudal powers
[16:01:24] <DunceCotus> cities paved with gold etc. even
[16:01:31] <DunceCotus> very steampunk but also with togas etc
[16:01:37] <DunceCotus> greco-roman steampunk
[16:02:49] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: the cataclysm wiped out a lot it seems, and what wasn't wiped out was commandeered or covered up by those who seized power in the brief window of power vacuum post-cataclysm
[16:03:02] <DunceCotus> most people perished, their remains buried deep underground in catacombs or caves
[16:03:46] <DunceCotus> I say most people but there were still children it seems
[16:04:02] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: where do you get all of this from?
[16:04:08] <DunceCotus> those who seized power perhaps kept some people still alive from those times and turned them into baby-factories
[16:04:28] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: it is evidentiary 
[16:04:54] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: you need only know how to read the very architecture you pass-by everyday (well in a lot of western cities anyway)
[16:05:35] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: like there's the paris catacombs, filled with meticulously arranged bones
[16:05:45] <DunceCotus> where did all the skeletons come from?
[16:06:00] <DunceCotus> why is it arranged like that, why aren't they buried in proper christian tradition etc.
[16:06:03] <DunceCotus> that's because christian'

[16:07:54] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: well sometimes I do
[16:08:04] <amigojapan> Ok

[16:08:25] <DunceCotus> certain things we just don't know about, things we should know about

[16:08:40] <DunceCotus> but history
[16:08:51] <DunceCotus> and its accuracy.. well that is predicated on a certain belief about time and space
[16:08:56] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: one of the early 3d videogames was called catacombs and it scared me to hell as a 14 year old
[16:09:22] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: yes they are scary
[16:09:30] <DunceCotus> the idea of getting stuck down there
[16:09:36] <DunceCotus> or weird monsters inhabiting it
[16:09:42] <DunceCotus> and the bones don't help the fear much
[16:09:53] <amigojapan> Yup
[16:10:08] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: however that is a by-the-by, the scariest thing is most of our history could be complete hogwash
[16:10:47] <DunceCotus> and we are relatively fresh-faced from the last global cataclysm and increasingly are going to induce one upon ourselves?
[16:10:52] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: Japanese graves are less scary cause cremation has been the law for a long time
[16:11:59] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I don't believe in history,a lot of the ones they talk about from ww2 seems to be made up
[16:12:51] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: what really happened in the ww1 and ww2 was a consolidation of global powers and operating narratives, 'ideologies'
[16:12:56] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: you get conflicting history from country to country
[16:13:28] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: the three main systems were capitalism, communism and fascistic capitalism
[16:14:10] <DunceCotus> we were left with almost exclusively capitalism but it has taken elements of communism to appease the workers (a little) and elements of fascism too
[16:14:22] <DunceCotus> now we are probably more than ever in a fascistic society
[16:14:46] <DunceCotus> everyone policing each other, workers should be happy with the rights those with power give them etc.
[16:15:18] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: but basically all these systems are predicated on false or distorted histories
[16:15:35] <DunceCotus> they have to be to make sense perhaps, in the context of 'post-enlightenment'

[17:33:07] <zoidberg> Satin: why not qt? qt is better documented than gtk
[17:33:19] <Satin> I ain't fuckin with C++
[17:33:22] <Satin> i checked Qt first
[17:33:27] <Satin> downloaded it, signed up even
[17:33:29] <zoidberg> Ah
[17:33:32] <Satin> C++? big nope.
[17:33:38] <amigojapan> zoidberg: I recommended Qt creator
[17:33:43] <Satin> GTK is C :3c 
[17:34:00] <Satin> and yeah i struggled sometimes with the documentation, but it was a useful excercise of scouring demos
[17:34:08] <zoidberg> amigojapan:  nice, too many people hating C++ these days
[17:34:10] <Satin> cuz GTK4 is new
[17:34:24] <Satin> amigojapan: i don't hate C++, i just don't know it and am not interested in learning it at this time
[17:34:28] <Satin> I like C
[17:34:35] <zoidberg> Satin: C++ could land you job, seriously!
[17:34:42] <amigojapan> zoidberg: you don't have to use c++with Qt creator
[17:34:45] <Satin> sure, and I'll learn it eventually, with my classes and what not
[17:34:50] <Satin> but I don't want it at all right now
[17:35:08] <Satin> amigojapan: I prefer it this way 
[17:35:19] <amigojapan> Satin alright
[17:35:26] <Satin> I'm probably one of the first 100-200 users in the world that has made something with GTK4 it feels
[17:35:32] <Satin> or will be when i make this more seriously
[17:35:42] <zoidberg> amigojapan: I haven‚Äôt checked other languages but C++ in qt has damn good documentation, seriously good.
[17:35:54] <Sadale> I mean C could land you a job as well
[17:36:00] <Satin> of course it's good, Qt is the gold standard/cross platform in many ways
[17:36:01] <proppotatoxel[m]> i c

[17:36:17] <Satin> GTK is great but GTK is also pursuing wayland and breaks in between releases
[17:36:18] <Satin> yeah
[17:36:24] <Satin> it's changed a bunch of things
[17:36:30] <zoidberg> Lol Sadale, where have you been?
[17:36:30] <Sadale> have fun
[17:36:35] <Satin> i looked at the old examples and the new stuff
[17:36:38] <Satin> difference stuff
[17:36:40] <Satin> different*
[17:36:44] <Sadale> zoidberg, I haven't worked with linux gui for quite a while.
[17:36:57] <isekaijin> Satin: Are you actually programming against GTK directly, or are you using glade and other helper stuff?
[17:36:58] <Satin> okay time to get ready, and leave now. I feel like I accomplished something for once in a long time

[17:37:43] <Sadale> proppotatoxel[m], nya~ :3
[17:37:43] <Satin> isekaijin: i should tbh, but the builder UI stuff isn't very obvious to me at this time, and even if I do end up using stuff like glade, i need to understand the underlying stuff it feels to join the business logic with glade's stuff
[17:37:55] <zoidberg> I get back to reading. Later!
[17:37:58] <amigojapan> You should use glade Satin 
[17:38:03] <isekaijin> Satin: Actually, I agree. Glade obscures way too many things.
[17:38:15] <Satin> I mean, joining the two together didn't feel very obvious or intutitive
[17:38:27] <isekaijin> Satin: If you are still learning, you are probably better off getting a feel for how things work under the hood.
[17:38:28] <Satin> plus, mine isn't a very complicated app I think
[17:38:34] <proppotatoxel[m]> :3
[17:38:47] <Sadale> Satin, what are you developing this program for? :3
[17:38:48] <Satin> isekaijin: exactly, I count myself as a pretty beginner programmer, and it's an enjoyable experinence to see how things are going on under the hood
[17:38:51] <Sadale> Is that a class assignment? :3
[17:38:53] <isekaijin> Then you can use Glade when you understand with what it automates for you.
[17:39:10] <Satin> Sadale: no, I withdrew from all my classes this semester, PTSD from the shooting etc not letting me focus

[17:39:50] <Satin> next when i get a chance I'll try to add boxes to make it look prettier, which the scroll list will go under

[17:40:17] <Sadale> Satin, I hope that whoever shot you wouldn't just die. He'd have a long suffering live and his death would be dog slow and painful.
[17:40:42] <Satin> Sadale: I don't have any hate for that guy, i think the police caught him after he shot someone else? I don't know, the prosecutor won't tell me
[17:40:49] <Sadale> ah
[17:40:54] <Satin> cuz they want my original testimony
[17:41:11] <Satin> i haven't haerd anything since the detective had me pick from a photo line etc
[17:41:18] <Sadale> :S
[17:41:29] <Satin> it's a very uphill case too
[17:41:40] <Satin> the video footage from the store is very obvious and clear when he attacked and shot me
[17:41:48] <Sadale> I see.
[17:41:49] <Satin> but it's not showing his face etc
[17:41:55] <Satin> wearing masks etc
[17:42:07] <Satin> hard to establish identity etc, and the detective told me he wants to get a confession out of him

[17:42:32] <MootPoot> you eat / cook chinese right

[17:44:57] <Satin> it's just sitting doing nothing
[17:45:03] <Satin> but it also means i get CT scans rather than MRI etc
[17:45:10] <Sadale> as creepy as it sounds, if the doctor thinks that it's better to leave it there, it's probably better to just leave it there
[17:45:14] <Satin> idk if airport detectors go off from a 9 mm sititng there
[17:45:31] <Satin> yeah, i got too many surgeries so they decided to not touch it + it's in a hard to reach area
[17:45:48] <Satin> they told me i can in the future, like next month, get it taken out if i want to
[17:45:48] <Sadale> Satin, oh so could you access any airport with that bullet inside of you?
[17:46:19] <Satin> Sadale: i can, but some people tell me i could get a card or something to prove that i have that in me etc
[17:46:28] <Sadale> Cool!
[17:46:30] <Satin> but i doubt airport detectors care about 9 mm hollowed out bullets?

[18:05:32] <Sadale> I see.
[18:05:39] <Sadale> Didn't know that. Probably a word used there in Canada./

[18:15:30] <Sadale> I didn't know that AA batteries were powerful enough to drive soldering iron
[18:15:40] <MootPoot> first link
[18:16:00] <MootPoot> problem is you see that red button on it- you have to slide it into the "on" position
[18:16:04] <MootPoot> then you have to hold it down
[18:16:10] <MootPoot> otherwise it wont
[18:16:19] <Sadale> oh wait.
[18:16:19] <MootPoot> Sadale: its plenty for small jobs
[18:16:27] <Sadale> MootPoot, no temperature adjustment feature?
[18:16:28] <Sadale> meh
[18:16:41] <MootPoot> dont need that , just touch against your finger :P
[18:16:46] <MootPoot> coonsumerism
[18:16:48] <Sadale> ...
[18:16:54] <viper1829> that sounds very safe
[18:17:00] <Sadale> It's $15 only anyway.
[18:17:01] <MootPoot> annoyingly safe
[18:17:15] <Sadale> For the same price I'd rather to get an adjustable temperature one with power coord. :P
[18:17:23] <MootPoot> I have one of those as well
[18:17:27] <Sadale> oh.
[18:17:29] <MootPoot> but its annoying to plug it in
[18:17:33] <MootPoot> and deal with the wire
[18:17:44] <Sadale> MootPoot, damn not just you've got the money to spend. You've got the space to store your shit as well
[18:17:45] <MootPoot> this one is always just "there" for me to use instantly
[18:18:14] <MootPoot> by the time I get that one setup usually I'll already be done soldering with this one
[18:18:14] <Sadale> make sure not to eat sandwiches after soldering anything tho. You don't want to eat all those heavy metals.
[18:18:29] <MootPoot> I have a fan with a carbon filter on it for extraction
[18:18:38] <Sadale> and wash your hands thoroughtly
[18:19:24] <MootPoot> I would post a pic of my workbench
[18:19:27] <MootPoot> but its a mess
[18:19:28] <MootPoot> lol
[18:20:40] <Sadale> My workbench is just a chair xD
[18:20:50] <MootPoot> rip
[18:20:54] <Sadale> I just put a silicone mat onto a chair and use it as a soldering bench
[18:21:42] <MootPoot> I have my main desk, my electornics desk , my larger tool desk, my storage/operations desk, and another one I dont really use but its just there
[18:22:34] <Sadale> MootPoot, I mean it's Canada there. It's one of the least populated countries in the world with vast amount of lands
[18:22:49] <Sadale> It's like Russia
[18:22:58] <MootPoot> least populated countries - lowest amount of cute girls
[18:22:59] <MootPoot>  :(
[18:23:04] <Sadale> lol
[18:23:23] <Sadale> tell those dommes there that there's an innocent Sadale on the other side of the earth. xD

[18:42:01] <MootPoot> I think most people have given up really
[18:42:07] <MootPoot> just get used to endemic covid
[18:42:23] <MootPoot> just like we get seasonal flu shots - seasonal covid shots
[18:42:31] <MootPoot> soon they'll just mix it in with the normal flu shot
[18:43:05] <Sadale> Not in China. It's still aiming for 0 cases.
[18:43:31] <Sadale> It inclues Hong Kong of couse. It's aiming for 0 case as well.
[18:43:45] <MootPoot> china is pretty fast and loose with state reported numbers
[18:44:10] <MootPoot> I wouldn't trust them as a definitive number, but more like a general guideline 
[18:44:37] <Sadale> hmm.
[18:44:50] <Sadale> Some case would definitely slip thru in anywhere in the world.
[18:44:58] <Sadale> That's how a outbreak would start

[21:43:09] <ezekielnoob2> i need someone to cosplay cosette
[21:43:19] <ButterNoodle> I would but I need to shave

[21:45:40] <TsundereNoises> I'm trying to think of something to say, but I'm distracted, sorry
[21:45:45] <ezekielnoob2> i wondfer who can pull that off
[21:45:49] <ButterNoodle> why the hell is it called smashburger if she dont let me smash?
[21:46:06] <TsundereNoises> wouldn't a smash burger require 3 people?
[21:46:17] <ButterNoodle> ezekielnoob2: any girl that cosplays cosette can pull me off..
[21:46:26] <ButterNoodle> TsundereNoises: thats a spit roast
[21:46:36] <ezekielnoob2> double penetration
[21:46:36] <ButterNoodle> I mean ig it depends on positioning
[21:47:11] <TsundereNoises> yeah, the difference between spit roasts and smashburgers just depends on how you rearrange the meat
[21:47:18] <ButterNoodle> yes

[22:20:04] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: it gets at what pisses me off about deepl the most (although this was google): ignoring part of the sentence the algorithm doesn't think makes sense to make a sentence that reads like native english despite changing the meaning
[22:20:32] <TsundereNoises> I'm annoyed at this trend, I thought the word salad google sometimes spit out was occasionally more helpful, in a weird way
[22:20:36] <TsundereNoises> because you could sort of puzzle it out
[22:20:55] <TsundereNoises> although who wouldn't like to watch terrorist attacks with a cute fox girl?
[22:21:01] <emmeka> MootPoot still thinking he can machine translate things
[22:21:15] <MootPoot> ...
[22:21:30] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: no, just what I linked, we were making fun of the translation
[22:21:40] <MootPoot> emmeka here still forgetting like 80% of whatever I tell him
[22:21:45] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: she actually said "I'm going to sleep watching food porn"
[22:22:47] <MootPoot> hmm
[22:23:43] <emmeka> MootPoot nah, I remember it. You thought we could just AI our way to full translation that wasn't google gibberish, or that was at least useable and accurate enough to replace translators. but I have come in in the middle of this conversation and apparently you were not talking about this, so it's k
[22:23:51] <MootPoot> no
[22:24:00] <TsundereNoises> funny thing is, it's actually in the free EDICT dictionary, so really no reason google shouldn't be able to figure it out
[22:24:19] <TsundereNoises> just ignoring parts of sentences to make the english SOUND native-ish
[22:24:22] <MootPoot> emmeka: I see you left out the portion where I said it would easily take multiple decades
[22:24:54] <emmeka> I don't see how that's incompatible with what I said.
[22:25:07] <ezekielnoob2> ah i have another cosplayer in mind ButterNoodle her parents are actually musicians and they have a crap ton of musical instruments
[22:25:17] <MootPoot> emmeka: its dishonest framing
[22:25:38] <TsundereNoises> ANYWAY, I think this new neural network or whatever translation trend isn't really leading to better translations, just better SOUNDING translations
[22:25:40] <emmeka> and, like last time, something you have interjected only when someone objects to the initial premise
[22:25:54] <TsundereNoises> and it's frustrating to hear people think it is so much better just because the english comes out more coherent
[22:26:13] <MootPoot> yes, because I dont really go into IRC thinking every single  one of my statements is going to be evaluated as the premise of a debate
[22:26:24] <emmeka> TsundereNoises right. we're getting to the point where machines can produce English that makes sense, but that's only because it ignores whatever doesn't make sense and restructures around it
[22:26:38] <TsundereNoises> like grammatically valid sentences are better even if the meaning is off somehow
[22:26:55] <TsundereNoises> whereas when you get the word salad at least you KNOW the translation software has no clue wtf is going on

[22:27:13] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: to be fair, that's a classic mistake when dealing with The Internet
[22:27:44] <emmeka> the best use case of machine translating right now is actually the ones that include fairly broken text, because they can speed up human translation substantially. It's much quicker to edit a translation than it is to do that translation yourself.
[22:28:32] <emmeka> but this is only done professionally for translation work where the meaning isn't critical
[22:29:42] <TsundereNoises> exactly what I'm saying
[22:29:53] <MootPoot> amusingly I remember suggesting something similar with my anime subbing helper app - and you spent your time shitting on it taking the meaning to be 100% automated subs
[22:30:12] <TsundereNoises> and in cases like this, the over literal: "I'm falling asleep watching food terrorism" for example, would be easier to figure out even if you knew no japanese whatsoever
[22:30:13] <MootPoot> and here you are saying its the "best use case"
[22:30:30] <MootPoot> ooo - lunch break
[22:30:39] * MootPoot goes to make coffee
[22:30:52] <TsundereNoises> I mean ideally you just translate whatever without help
[22:31:13] <TsundereNoises> because if any of you have read "machined aided" WN translations, for example, ...
[22:31:22] <emmeka> MootPoot but that's not the best use case, because you're not doing machine-assisted translation
[22:31:33] <MootPoot> the idea was to just remove as much of the overhead from translating - letting the translator focus on their work as much as possible
[22:31:48] <emmeka> you don't understand the moon runes, and are just letting the machine translation go without correcting it
[22:31:57] <MootPoot> .....
[22:32:02] <MootPoot> again- same thing 
[22:32:12] <emmeka> no, it isn't, this is clearly not what I said.
