[00:02:44] <gwern> maybe around your area... I'm still not sure I've ever seen a supercharger station irl
[00:03:13] <two2thehead> hm
[00:03:45] <two2thehead> iirc Tesla is investing heavily/going to invest heavily in increasing charger availability
[00:04:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> I didn't see this before but apparently DSL made it to SneerClub a while ago: https://old.reddit.com/r/SneerClub/comments/lrjm52/slatestarcodex_anagram_forum_datasecretslox_tries/

[00:05:05] * gwern squints at the supercharger map. looks like there is... exactly 1 about a 45 minute drive away from me, then in the entire county+, there's another one about another 45 minutes away
[00:05:13] <two2thehead> huh. that makes sense. great sense
[00:05:56] <meowcat> since the new roadster has AGI, the supercharger map is not a "sufficient criterion" for torturing electric cars
[00:05:59] <kuudes> if you would have a tesla, why would you not have a home charger?
[00:06:12] <ggreer> maybe you park on the street
[00:06:17] <two2thehead> kuudes, i think gwern meant just in general
[00:06:36] <kuudes> it is a 100ke car, why would you not have a carage for that
[00:06:48] <ggreer> maybe you live in berkeley
[00:07:10] <kuudes> oh yeah california reality distortion
[00:07:10] * gwern is confused since he shops once in a while at where that supercharger is, but doesn't recall it at all. he pulls up google maps and looks at the satellite imagery... which is apparently literally like 5+ years old because the shopping mall in question is just a forest of trees -_-

[01:12:42] <gwern> https://marijn.uk/wikipedia/ meh. I don't think the wsj hedcut style works unless you have a really high quality automated one
[01:12:43] <Robomot> Interesting Wikipedia articles | Marijn's site üçá
[01:12:46] <gwern> hm...
[01:13:23] <gwern> RiversHaveWings: what do you think? could CLIP do decent https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedcut ? they did a little GAN, I think, once, but the results were awful
[01:13:24] <Robomot> Hedcut - Wikipedia (Hedcut is a term referring to a style of drawing, associated with The Wall Street Journal half-column portrait illustrations. They use the stipple method of many small dots and the hatching method of small lines to create an image, and are designed to emulate the look of woodcuts from old-style newspapers, and engravings on certificates and currency. ‚Ä¶)
[01:13:25] <adiabatic> this isn't hedcut, this is Old Mac style
[01:13:50] <gwern> are you sure? it looks like some lame dithering intended to imitate wsj hedcuts
[01:14:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: This "heximal" is silly... "foxex-fox"? Come on
[01:14:12] <RiversHaveWings> gwern: maybe on a generator trained on them
[01:14:29] <adiabatic> sorry, Floyd-Steinberg: https://beyondloom.com/blog/dither.html
[01:14:32] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: it's a stalking horse, a catspaw, if you will. (furries everywhere!)
[01:14:53] <adiabatic> or maybe Atkinson, I dunno
[01:15:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Also, I concur with adiabatic, this is clearly dithering of the old sort, not hedcut
[01:15:13] <gwern> RiversHaveWings: would putting in 'wall street journal, monochrone hedcut portrait' potentially work?
[01:15:18] <RiversHaveWings> let me try it
[01:16:49] <gwern> RiversHaveWings: also, is there still no way to put in an image(s) and extract a style code to optimize for a generic style transfer? like, maybe I've suggested this before, but it seems like if you clip-image embdded a few dozen WSJ hedcuts and then averaged out their embeddings, what would be left would be a style embedding, which you could then optimize arbitrary images towards while...
[01:16:55] <gwern> ...clamping the content dimensions
[01:17:27] <RiversHaveWings> gwern: this is the average embeds trick, our local scripts for making NFTs with CLIP do it >_>
[01:17:50] <gwern> RiversHaveWings: oh, so it does work for style transfer?
[01:17:53] <RiversHaveWings> yeah
[01:17:58] <RiversHaveWings> It does
[01:18:12] <gwern> that seems pretty useful
[01:18:33] <gwern> and something that would make a good library, curating averaged embeddings for scores of styles
[01:18:53] <RiversHaveWings> i have also averaged the embeds of entire ImageNet classes
[01:18:57] <RiversHaveWings> This also works
[01:19:19] <gwern> (so you could just call 'clipize(image, Style.vaporwave)' etc)
[01:20:06] <gwern> imagenet classes are boring, though. no one wants to style transfer to one of a hundred slightly different dog breeds. we want paintbrushes like "vaporwave" or "vangogh" or "pokemon" or "wsjhedcut"
[01:20:27] <gwern> even (gods help us) "beeple"
[01:20:33] <RiversHaveWings> ahah
[01:21:27] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: ok, I amend my observation. I think he *wants* wsj hedcut style, because it's a pretty notable style and fits in with the upperclass book skeumorphism he and I have going, but old-fashioned dithering is just the best he can do
[01:24:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> Could be, could be
[01:24:36] <gwern> if he wanted to go for classic mac, well, you saw the hex page. the WP page would look like a mac screenshot
[01:25:13] <gwern> he wouldn't be using his fancy serif fonts with the 'st' ligatures' and wide tildes and carefully composed bold/italic/body hierarchies

[01:30:02] <gwern> hm. 'pointilist'? 'dithered'?
[01:30:04] <RiversHaveWings> They have original images for all of theirs, right?
[01:30:20] <gwern> presumably
[01:30:20] <RiversHaveWings> And they just didn't manage train a good model?
[01:30:31] <gwern> they might not have enough data
[01:30:34] <RiversHaveWings> ah
[01:31:11] <gwern> even if there are tens of thousands of hedcuts total (they must publish at least 1 per day), the highres originals & art are not necessarily digitized or available anywhere
[01:31:36] <RiversHaveWings> Yeah this is just with an ImageNet trained diffusion model
[01:31:42] <RiversHaveWings> So the style is really OOD for it.
[01:32:01] <gwern> oh, this isn't starting with an actual joe biden image?
[01:32:06] <RiversHaveWings> Oh, no.
[01:32:14] <gwern> I didn't think you could get good from-scratch results, that's why I was asking about style transfer
[01:32:17] <RiversHaveWings> Oh
[01:32:31] <RiversHaveWings> I think you could get good from-scratch w/ a custom trained generator
[01:32:35] <RiversHaveWings> But yeah
[01:32:58] <gwern> (plus, that's why I was originally looking into wsj hedcuts a while back - I liked the style and thought I could automatically transform all on-site images into hedcuts, but the WSJ generator quality was low and they haven't released the model anyway)
[01:34:47] <RiversHaveWings> gonna try that with VQGAN now

[02:00:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Just two months ago Biden prematurely declared the nation‚Äôs ‚Äúindependence‚Äù from the virus. Now, despite more than 208 million Americans having at least one dose of the vaccines, the U.S. is seeing about 300% more new COVID-19 infections a day, about two-and-a-half times more hospitalizations, and nearly twice the number of deaths compared to the same time last year." ... but hang on, if this is true, exactly how much
[02:00:51] <Obormot\Arcturus>  effect are we expecting this new mandate to have?
[02:01:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> "After months of using promotions to drive the vaccination rate, Biden is taking a much firmer hand, as his aides blame people who have not yet received shots for the sharp rise in cases that is killing more than 1,000 people per day and imperiling a fragile economic rebound." ... something weird about this logic
[02:01:26] <kuudes> hmm. us icus and hospitals are now getting overrun, or?
[02:01:33] <Betawolf> '‚ÄúThere is an aspect to this now that has to do with our country being so divided,‚Äù said Sharfstein. ‚ÄúThis has become so politicized that people can‚Äôt see the value of a vaccination that can save their lives. Our own divisions are preventing us from ending a pandemic.‚Äù' so of course more demonising the unvaccinated and forcing them to do things against their will is the solution.
[02:01:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: Yes, absolutely, see the article about "health system collapse" posted here the other day
[02:01:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> https://slate.com/technology/2021/09/healthcare-system-collapse-icu-ration-beds.html
[02:01:56] <Robomot> The health care system has collapsed due to coronavirus. (Delta hasn't brought us to the brink or the edge. We're way past that.)
[02:02:10] <kuudes> :-(
[02:02:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> My question is what does this mandate say about booster shots and new variants
[02:03:07] <ggreer> slate just makes stuff up. the health care system usually runs as close as possible to "collapsing" just like every other part of the economy. having idle equipment and staff is wasteful
[02:03:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Psaki said Biden‚Äôs ‚Äúoverarching objective here is to reduce the number of unvaccinated Americans,‚Äù noting about 80 million adults remain unvaccinated." ... my other question is how much overlap exactly is there between the people affected by this mandate, and the currently unvaccinated population
[02:03:32] <Betawolf> 'reduce the number' lol
[02:03:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> My third question is has anyone actually checked how much of the new infections are by/from/to vaccinated people
[02:04:02] <ggreer> not a ton, but it's going to be very annoying for employers to ask for proof of vaccination
[02:04:15] <ggreer> also there doesn't seem to be an exception for "already recovered from covid" or "works remotely"
[02:05:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> ggreer: For sure, although I was actually getting at a different aspect of this, namely: suppose everyone who this mandate says should be vaccinated, gets vaccinated. As a direct result of that, the number of unvaccinated people is reduced to?
[02:05:00] <Betawolf> Maybe prominent Democrats can stand outside the vaccination centres pelting them with eggs and abuse as they're led in in chains to be medicated without their consent, on live television. That'll heal the nation.
[02:05:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> 0? Still 80 million? Something in between?
[02:05:11] <meowcat> 1918 called, they want their antivax movement back
[02:05:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> 1 million? 79 million?
[02:05:35] <ggreer> you know what'd be *really* fun? require proof of vaccination for unemployment benefits
[02:05:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> Wow
[02:06:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> Sounds like a whole lotta new sinecures in unemployment administration
[02:06:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> Write to the president imo, suggest it
[02:07:04] <meowcat> as of next week, it shall be illegal to sell lottery tickets to any unvaccinated person.
[02:07:15] <meowcat> pit the antivax against the antimath.
[02:07:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Biden‚Äôs order for executive branch workers and contractors includes exceptions for workers seeking religious or medical exemptions from vaccination, according to Psaki. Federal workers and contractors will have 75 days to get fully vaccinated. Workers who don‚Äôt comply will be referred to their agencies‚Äô human resources departments for counseling and discipline, to include potential termination." ... wow
[02:07:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> "counseling and discipline"
[02:08:06] <meowcat> as in "do you want to get fired? i counsel you to get vaccinated if you do not."
[02:09:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> So, like... I think that everyone who can get the vax should. (I don't think the risk of side effects compares to the risk of COVID, esp. given what we increasingly know about long covid etc.) But ...
[02:09:10] <meowcat> u n i t a r y   e x e c u t i v e
[02:09:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... I don't see anywhere in this article any attempt to estimate how much of an effect all these measures will actually have
[02:09:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> Even to as basic a degree as "who are the unvaccinated"
[02:10:04] <ggreer> I assume some states will rebel against this
[02:10:19] <meowcat> states aren't in charge of federal employment policy :)
[02:10:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> It seems like it would be totally possible for all these measures to completely succeed and then for us to look around and go "oh, actually we still have... 70 million unvaccinated people"
[02:10:32] <ggreer> states aren't in charge of drug policy but I can buy weed
[02:10:38] <Betawolf> Sure backs up the hatred the US media has been dousing the unvaccinated with though, so maybe Biden will make back some friends he lost over Afghanistan.

[02:11:07] <meowcat> for people who are employees of the federal government, joe sets their terms of employment regardless of what their state governor says.
[02:11:23] <ggreer> using OSHA to require vaccination of employees is pretty lame
[02:11:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> I mean, am I missing something? Doesn't it make sense to ask that question? Isn't there a step missing between "we have a problem" and "we are going to do solution X"?
[02:11:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like "we think solution X will in fact solve the problem, because reasons Y"?
[02:11:57] <kuudes> to my eyes it seems you are correct, but I don't know how things work over there
[02:12:01] <meowcat> Is it really worth brainstorming ways to help people get out of getting vaccinated?
[02:12:12] <meowcat> That seems like a poor use of one's mental capabilities.
[02:12:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> meowcat: Is that re: what I am saying? Or ggreer? Or who
[02:13:05] <kuudes> usa opened up to vaxing children though, didn't it?
[02:13:12] <kuudes> are they vaccinating children now?
[02:13:20] <saturn2> 12 and over
[02:13:32] <ggreer> I got my first shot back in march and was fully vaccinated in april. I'm definitely in favor of mRNA vaccines. I'm not a fan of authoritarianism
[02:13:35] <ggreer> > The expansive rules mandate that all employers with more than 100 workers require them to be vaccinated or test for the virus weekly, affecting about 80 million Americans.
[02:13:35] <kuudes> the pfizers approval was without age limit, wasn't it saturn2?
[02:13:41] <ggreer> ^^ this is the thing I have an issue with
[02:14:09] <saturn2> kuudes: not sure...
[02:14:12] <ggreer> kuudes: I'm pretty sure it was for 16 and up, then they lowered it to 12 once they did some trials. they're doing trials for younger now
[02:14:16] <kuudes> you should maybe get your third dose now ggreer
[02:14:36] <ggreer> I'm wary of a 3rd dose. second dose was brutal
[02:14:50] <ggreer> I was bedridden and in horrible pain for days. I'd rather break my ribs again
[02:15:18] *** Quits: adiabatty (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[02:16:21] <kuudes> I would take third and fourth doses the minute I am allowed to
[02:16:37] <kuudes> too bad finland is too legible for me to try to bribe people to dose me
[02:16:43] <kuudes> hmm
[02:16:56] <kuudes> capisce, would it be feasible for me to go to estonia to get third dose?
[02:16:58] <meowcat> personally, i think it's silly to make people arrange their own vaccinations. we have all these vacant office buildings. just turn them into temp vaccination clinics and send people through them by street
[02:17:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> I was feeling bad for a couple of days, definitely would prefer not to get it again, but would also prefer not to get more covid
[02:17:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> But also I really don't want to just have to keep getting boosters of this stuff regularly forever
[02:17:47] <kuudes> meh, I take flu vaccine each year already
[02:18:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't
[02:18:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> Never have
[02:18:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Most of the spread ‚Äî and the vast majority of severe illness and death ‚Äî is occurring among those not yet fully vaccinated. So-called breakthrough infections in vaccinated people occur, but tend to be far less dangerous." ... hm
[02:18:08] <kuudes> saturn2, https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-vaccine-pfizer-approval-1361ff61d06b815652a08a7cc0683a72 seems to say I am mistaken
[02:18:08] <Robomot> US regulators give full approval to Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine (WASHINGTON (AP) ‚Äî The U.S. gave full approval to Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine Monday, potentially boosting public confidence in the shots and instantly opening the way for more universities, companies and local governments to make vaccinations mandatory. ‚Ä¶)
[02:18:21] <saturn2> ok
[02:18:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> But, like ... if the problem is with the unvaccinated... isn't that... their own problem??
[02:18:43] <kuudes> well, it is your problem if you should get to icu but can't
[02:18:49] <meowcat> it's called "public health"
[02:18:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> Also the end of this article mentions boosters but entirely fails to answer the obvious and critical question of "does this mandate require taking the boosters"
[02:19:00] <meowcat> that means being concerned for the health of all the public, even the dumbos
[02:19:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> Does it actually?
[02:19:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> Does it mean being concerned enough to force people to vaccinate even if they don't want to and are only harming themselves?
[02:19:36] <kuudes> well, a major thing is that spread within the unvaccinated causes cases for the vaccinated as well
[02:19:50] <kuudes> if all people would be vaccinated, there would at least be fewer cases
[02:20:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> (The obvious counterargument is that the unvaccinated are helping the virus keep spreading and mutating and that harms the vaccinated)
[02:20:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> But "public health" is not a satisfactory answer at all
[02:20:34] <kuudes> 3 doses for 95%+ population should per current knowledge possibly stop spread completely
[02:20:43] <meowcat> no, the obvious counterargument is that a concern for the public does not permit writing anyone off that easily.
[02:20:43] <kuudes> even with delta
[02:21:05] <meowcat> you don't get to say "oops, you broke one rule, therefore you are now an outlaw and have no protections from anything"
[02:21:09] <meowcat> that's not how societies work
[02:21:13] <kuudes> in usa, though
[02:21:15] <Obormot\Gaia> meowcat: If that's so, then "public health" is synonymous with "oppression" and is evil
[02:21:16] <Betawolf> it's not 'writing people off' to fire them for not doing what you say.
[02:21:28] <kuudes> meowcat, usa sort of is not a society in that regard
[02:21:28] <meowcat> i dunno man, the virus wants to kill you personally
[02:21:39] <Obormot\Gaia> Betawolf: No we're talking about letting the unvaccinated stay that way
[02:21:41] <kuudes> its wild west there, man
[02:21:50] <Obormot\Gaia> Betawolf: That's what meowcat was referring to as "writing people off"
[02:21:52] <meowcat> public health measures are not something invented by 21st century democrats
[02:22:02] <meowcat> this is, um, basic civilization stuff
[02:22:09] <Obormot\Gaia> No definitely not
[02:22:13] <meowcat> you don't let people accumulate piles of rotting corpses inside the city walls
[02:22:15] <kuudes> no they are not, but in 70s usa switched away from that
[02:22:16] <Betawolf> Oh, sorry. To *not* fire them.
[02:22:21] <meowcat> you don't let leather tanners operate upwind
[02:22:31] <kuudes> because there came those civil rights and some people didn't want other people to have them
[02:22:32] <meowcat> poisoning wells is way worse than ordinary murder
[02:22:45] <kuudes> so they stopped much of tax paid public services and privatized them
[02:22:49] <Obormot\Gaia> meowcat: You're being very sloppy by conflating harm to self and harm to others
[02:23:01] <Obormot\Gaia> These things must be *sharply* distinguished
[02:23:04] <ggreer> meowcat: you can get vaccinated in the US by going to most pharmacies. during the big push in the spring, there were drive-through vaccination clinics. just roll up to the parking lot, roll the window down, roll your sleeve up
[02:23:05] <meowcat> no, i'm just not being a doctrinaire libertarian.
[02:23:12] <Obormot\Gaia> This isn't about libertarianism
[02:23:16] <meowcat> is it not?
[02:23:27] <Obormot\Gaia> There is a categorical difference between choosing to harm oneself and choosing to harm others
[02:23:54] <Obormot\Gaia> "We won't let you harm other people" is, indeed, "basic civilization stuff"
[02:23:57] <meowcat> sure, you can go live in the wilderness if you want to keep poopies and dead bodies inside your house.
[02:24:06] <Obormot\Gaia> You're still doing it
[02:24:09] <meowcat> that's not what civilized people do, because it makes them and other people sick.
[02:24:28] <Obormot\Gaia> If you don't distinguish between these two things then everything you say about this will be nonsense
[02:25:08] <meowcat> if you keep all your personal individual poops inside your personal individual house that is your property, eventually the sheriff will come around and condemn it and you can't live there anymore.
[02:25:30] <Obormot\Gaia> I don't know what point you're trying to make with that, tbh
[02:25:39] <Obormot\Gaia> I don't have any sheriff though
[02:25:50] <meowcat> in a civilization, you don't get to be arbitrarily septic.
[02:26:04] <meowcat> your septicism is limited by the tolerance of others for disease that you cultivate.
[02:26:14] <meowcat> eventually they kick you out.
[02:26:17] <Obormot\Gaia> (Actually that's not true, we do have a sheriff's office, but they don't do criminal law enforcement)
[02:26:30] <kuudes> what do they do?
[02:26:41] <Obormot\Gaia> kuudes: civil law enforcement
[02:26:42] <Obormot\Gaia> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Sheriff%27s_Office
[02:26:43] <Robomot> New York City Sheriff's Office - Wikipedia (The New York City Sheriff's Office (NYCSO), officially the Office of the Sheriff of the City of New York, is the primary civil law enforcement agency for New York City.[1] The Sheriff's Office is a division of the New York City Department of Finance, operating as an enforcement arm.[ ‚Ä¶)
[02:27:13] <kuudes> hmm, thanks
[02:27:27] <Obormot\Gaia> meowcat: Ok, it kinda sounds like you're not getting what I'm saying, and how it relates to your point. Are you?
[02:27:35] <kuudes> currently with less than 3 doses unvaccinated mainly harm themselves
[02:27:54] <meowcat> i think you're insisting on Individual Responsibility First! for a subject that is, and has always been, a civilizational matter.
[02:27:57] <kuudes> with 3 doses or equivalent infection prevention, there comes in the herd immunity concept
[02:28:15] <kuudes> so there defecting from that brings the harm of the population up more than just your harm
[02:28:28] <Obormot\Gaia> meowcat: But what makes it a "civilizational matter"? Do you see how the critical question in that regard is whether or not what you do harms others, or only yourself?
[02:28:55] <kuudes> with 2 doses or less the disease still will make rounds in the society, but for most of the infected the consequences are much less than without vaccination
[02:29:12] <kuudes> with 3+ it could be that the disease would stop before most people get exposed
[02:29:20] <Obormot\Gaia> kuudes: Um, so I actually hadn't heard this about 3 vs. 2 doses, do you have a cite
[02:29:29] <meowcat> in a sense sure, but it doesn't depend on an individual other being able to say "here, i can prove that YOU were the one who infected me."  We have health standards, like 'you shall not run a restaurant with cockroaches on the counters' and 'you shall not keep dead bodies in your attic'.
[02:29:30] <kuudes> Obormot\Gaia, the israel data
[02:29:33] <Obormot\Gaia> kuudes: And how does this interact with new variants
[02:29:40] <kuudes> with delta
[02:30:10] <saturn2> non-delta would be suppressed with 2 doses, delta takes 3
[02:30:15] <kuudes> that
[02:30:23] <Obormot\Gaia> meowcat: You keep bringing up these kinds of "health standards" things as if you think that I might or do disagree with them, which suggests to me that you definitely don't get my point
[02:30:25] <meowcat> The responsibility to others is necessarily distributed, because viruses are very small and they blow around.  It's not just the person who keeps corpses in their attic who might get sick.
[02:30:25] *** Joins: CryptoDavid (uid14990@id-14990.highgate.irccloud.com)
[02:30:32] <Obormot\Gaia> saturn2: Hmm, I see
[02:30:42] <Obormot\Gaia> meowcat: *facepalm*
[02:30:57] <kuudes> well, the original wuhan variant would be suppressed with 2 doses, alpha and beta and gamma are in gray zone
[02:31:31] <kuudes> but so far it seems basicly that each variant -> worse, infects more, needs better vaccines; but also more doses -> better vaccine coverage
[02:31:56] <Obormot\Gaia> meowcat: Please, please try actually reading what the person you're talking to is writing, and thinking about what they in fact believe and are trying to convey, rather than reciting standard talking points
[02:31:56] <kuudes> so so far we still have the option of just pushing those vax jabs to people and hope we can do that faster than the disease
[02:32:44] <kuudes> meowcat, with 2 doses sort of everyone still will get infected, so it does not matter if their neighbour vaxes themselves or not
[02:33:00] <meowcat> obormot: Please don't reiterate standard libertarian talking points about 'my choices only harm me' in cases where that is dramatically not the case, and has absolutely never in the history of history been the case for infectious disease!
[02:33:00] <kuudes> so the main benefit of vax is then for the vaxed person themselves
[02:33:23] <kuudes> but indeed the unvaxed will take icu space and then noncovid people will get killed because they don't fit into icu
[02:33:35] <kuudes> so it is indirectly societal, but not directly
[02:33:49] <Obormot\Gaia> meowcat: I'm not a libertarian and I am perfectly well aware how infectious diseases work, so, once again, your comments are *wildly* misaimed
[02:34:33] <meowcat> ok, so why insist that people who live in civilization should get to breed virus in their bodies?
[02:34:42] <Obormot\Gaia> Good god
[02:36:20] <kuudes> .note capisce would it be possible for a finn to get third dose in estonia officially or unofficially?
[02:37:38] <kuudes> meowcat, are you speaking for mandatory vaccinations?
[02:37:38] <Obormot\Gaia> kuudes: So that's totally true, but on the other hand it's a little odd to apply this reasoning *only* to vaccination (and only against this virus)
[02:37:38] <meowcat> it would be better if they were so omnipresent that 'mandatory' didn't enter into it!
[02:37:58] <meowcat> but nobody should have to make a Hard Decision about Whether To Get Vaxxed. The default should be yes.
[02:38:10] <kuudes> meowcat, I am in the understanding that in usa indeed the problem is that many people do not want to get vaccinated
[02:38:19] <kuudes> ie they actively oppose getting jabbed
[02:38:29] <meowcat> that opinion was cultivated
[02:38:32] <kuudes> there are apparently enough vaccination opportunities there
[02:38:39] <Obormot\Gaia> kuudes: Right? Like, pick any kind of dangerous activity, and we can say: by doing activity X, you create situations where you take up ICU space and then people who didn't do X might die because they couldn't receive care
[02:38:40] <meowcat> in an environment of manufactured doubt.
[02:39:39] <Obormot\Gaia> kuudes: One might respond by saying "but pretty much there is no X such that so many people are doing X and getting seriously harmed thereby that hospitals are overwhelmed, except where X = staying unvax vs. covid" ...
[02:39:46] <kuudes> Obormot\Gaia, well, yes, we restrict some too dangerous activities like cave diving is often done against the laws etc
[02:40:09] <Obormot\Gaia> kuudes: ... but then it seems like any individual person is only to blame for this to the extent that there are many others also doing it, which is ... odd
[02:40:17] <kuudes> and indeed some more extreme people have proposed to cut unvaccinated off from healthcare or to deprioritize them etc
[02:40:26] <kuudes> Obormot\Gaia, well, sure
[02:40:36] <kuudes> and indeed it is not the mainline opinion
[02:40:59] <kuudes> yet, it appears for instance hepatitis C treatment often unnecessarily is conditioned on the person quitting to use illegal drugs
[02:41:25] <kuudes> which is indeed a problem, as there is no such law allowing to deny that effective treatment on people with such life choices
[02:41:47] <ggreer> depends on the treatment. liver transplant usually requires being healthy, young, etc
[02:41:50] <Obormot\Gaia> If anything it seems more blameworthy to do illegal drugs than to avoid vaccination
[02:42:03] <Obormot\Gaia> Laws aside, I mean
[02:42:15] <ggreer> because there are only so many livers to go around, so the transplant boards try to give them to the most deserving people
[02:42:21] <Betawolf> Maybe next Biden will get employers to fire all the fatties.
[02:42:35] <kuudes> ggreer, there are medications for that though, and afaik it is problematic that in many places the doctors condition those medication courses with such extralegal requirement
[02:42:56] <kuudes> Betawolf, better to fire all people who go to gym
[02:43:11] <Betawolf> How so? 
[02:43:14] <kuudes> injuries seem possibly to create more costs than obesity
[02:43:19] <kuudes> at least in eu
[02:43:31] <Betawolf> Hmm, why not both?
[02:43:35] <kuudes> usa is fatter though so there the scale could be tipped the other way
[02:43:48] <Obormot\Gaia> ggreer: That gets at another point I was about to make, i.e. that there the problem seems to actually be "why are there not more livers to go around, is it maybe because we're failing to do some optimal health policy", and in the same way, maybe the real question about this whole "unvax'd are taxing the health system" business is like "why can't we expand capacity, or have more capacity, what are we fucking up that this is
[02:43:48] <Obormot\Gaia>  even a problem"
[02:44:03] <kuudes> yeah, over here organ donation is opt-out
[02:44:04] <Obormot\Gaia> (And the answer is definitely more like "almost everything" than "almost nothing")
[02:44:15] <ggreer> well yeah, people can't sell livers so nobody goes under the knife unless they really care (or they die)
[02:44:25] <kuudes> but not the singaporean way where opting out means you can't get stuff yourself
[02:44:34] <kuudes> can you donate liver without being dead?
[02:44:40] <ggreer> you can donate part of your liver
[02:44:42] <Obormot\Gaia> Well my point is that this reasoning applies in general
[02:44:43] <kuudes> hmm
[02:44:55] <Obormot\Gaia> "Our health system is overtaxed" well this seems to point to a bigger problem
[02:44:57] <kuudes> yeah, then there could indeed be incentives that would matter
[02:45:00] <meowcat> livers are amazing. you can donate a single lobe, and grow it back.
[02:45:09] <ggreer> obviously it means general anesthesia and surgery, so there's permanent damage to you if you do
[02:45:28] <ggreer> and a risk of premature death because shit sometimes goes wrong during surgery
[02:45:33] <saturn2> obviously our health system has problems...

[02:46:46] <rmmh> all the nurses and doctors are getting burnt out from tending corpses for 18 months
[02:46:59] <kuudes> I mean, making special migration rules for pro nurses would seem quite sane for most countries
[02:47:02] <rmmh> it's not purely a hospital space problem
[02:47:25] <kuudes> also that would mean people in poor countries would pay more to get nurse certification to migrate
[02:47:38] <kuudes> and that would likely be more useful than yet another coder, I would think?

[07:37:19] <mst> you fluff a pillow basically by pulling the sides out and fucking around with it until the contents redistribute less compactly
[07:37:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> I have never fluffed a pillow or a porn star... the only thing I've ever fluffed is rice after cooking it
[07:38:03] <mst> gwern: I mean, if I haven't fluffed a pornstar (and if I have I was too drunk to remember) it's not surprise that our less degenerate compatriots haven't?
[07:38:16] <adiabatic> I've fluffed rice and pillows but no pornstars
[07:39:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> The pillow I have doesn't have "stuffing" that can shift around
[07:39:12] <mst> well, unless foreplay with a woman who was a child porn star in her sub-age-10 years counts
[07:39:50] <mst> but I don't think her father or her grandfather ever paid her for her 'performances'
[07:39:57] <mst> so maybe the pro tag is lost
[07:40:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> There are polyfill pillows? :\
[07:40:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't want to involve JavaScript in my sleep routine...
[07:40:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> What if it gets updated and I can't fall asleep anymore
[07:40:45] <saturn2> polycule pillows?
[07:41:17] *** Quits: voltage_ (voltage@user/voltage) (Quit: Leaving)
[07:41:27] <mst> standard issue catgirls aren't fluffy enough to be that comfortable to sleep on
[07:41:33] <mst> you want to go with the furries
[07:41:37] <nshepperd2> polycule pillows are warm but they move around too much
[07:45:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok yeah this is definitely cotton
[07:46:06] <adiabatic> you should replace your cotton pillow and buy a new exotic type to try it out
[07:46:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> no
[07:46:29] <adiabatic> yes
[07:46:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> My attitude toward pillows is the same as my attitude toward WoW Classic
[07:46:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> #nochanges
[07:48:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> Wow do they not make pillows in this size anymore
[07:48:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> What is this
[07:53:33] <feepbot> <gwern> 'As Satya and Ryan mentioned, the evolving Delta variant is compelling many of us to adjust plans for reopening worksites. It‚Äôs a stark reminder that this is the new normal. Our ability to come together will ebb and flow. In fact, we had planned for Oct. 4 to be the first possible date to fully reopen Microsoft‚Äôs own Redmond headquarters, and many other work sites in
[07:53:34] <feepbot> the U.S. But as we shared with our employees today, we‚Äôve shifted those plans. Given the uncertainty of COVID-19, we‚Äôve decided against attempting to forecast a new date for a full reopening of our U.S. work sites in favor of opening U.S. work sites as soon as we‚Äôre able to do so safely based on public health guidance. From there, we‚Äôll communicate a 30-day transition
[07:53:34] <feepbot> period that provides time for employees to prepare while allowing us to continue to be agile and flexible as we look to the data and make choices to protect employee health, safety and well-being.' https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2021/09/09/microsoft-and-linkedin-share-latest-data-and-innovation-for-hybrid-work/

At the time of the events of the PT, he has already had the vision that allows him to structure his plans for the future to ensure the outcome of the end of the NT. This has been his plan all along. Each and every failure and setback has been deliberately orchestrated, God-Emperor style. Each and every apparent failure makes the enemy more confident, drawing

[16:34:34] <two2thehead> kuudes, s0ph1a feep : I was googling 'airport security detectors for home use' and one of the suggested searches was 'Can airport Body Scanners See tampons?'. Mildly interesting.
[16:35:01] <two2thehead> https://mamainstincts.com/scanner-can-see-menstrual-cup/
[16:35:02] <Robomot> The TSA Full Body Scanner CAN See Your Menstrual Cup - Here‚Äôs What You Need to Know ‚Äì Mama Instincts¬Æ (Have you ever wondered if the airport full body scan can see your menstrual products? Yes, it can. Find out what to expect when flying with your period.)
[16:35:27] <two2thehead> Apparently the answer is yes "To my surprise I found reports of women getting extra security screening because their panty liners, pads, tampons or menstrual cups were detected by the full body scanner"
[16:36:52] <feep> huh
[16:41:13] <feep> welp, there's a function that llvm completely compiles to just "ud2;"
[16:41:18] <feep> I fucked up something ;.;
[16:45:37] <PapuaHardyNet> ud2;?
[16:46:13] <PapuaHardyNet> that doesn't do anything at all, right?
[16:46:25] <PapuaHardyNet> I assume ud2 is a variable
[16:46:52] <RiversHaveWings> it's an undefined instruction opcode, raises an error
[16:47:14] <RiversHaveWings> i think it generates it for undefined behavior
[16:48:30] <PapuaHardyNet> I see

[16:57:50] <feep> basically if you get a function that's just "ud2;" it means llvm figured out that you fucked up somewhere
[16:58:15] <feep> but instead of, like, *telling you this*, it just went "well this is now undefined behavior, I can do what I want wheeeee" and threw the entire function in the trash bin
[16:58:39] <feep> thanks llvm, v useful
[17:00:16] <mst> feep: well, yeah, it's a C compiler
[17:00:19] <mst> that's how they roll
[17:00:25] <feep> fyi ud2 is https://mudongliang.github.io/x86/html/file_module_x86_id_318.html
[17:00:26] <Robomot> Control: x86 Instruction Set Reference (x86 assembly tutorials, x86 opcode reference, programming, pastebin with syntax highlighting)
[17:00:39] <feep> it's an instruction whose only purpose is to fault
[17:00:46] <feep> mst: I know ;.;
[17:00:58] <feep> mst: I mean, this isn't even C, this is straight llvm ir
[17:01:03] <feep> it's still how it rolls tho
[17:01:23] <mst> on the upside, now you can write some code that detects it and says 'ud2 generated, you done fucked up, son' before you run it and watch the pretty fireworks
[17:01:26] <feep> well, time to read through 1000 lines of changes
[17:02:08] <PapuaHardyNet> aren't there better compilesr
[17:02:31] <mst> PapuaHardyNet: all C compilers do this, taking advantage of UB is a huge part of optimisation
[17:02:40] <dTal> what would you expect a better compiler to do?
[17:03:04] <PapuaHardyNet> so you wrote a compiler for your language in C, which is why you are getting ub
[17:03:11] <mst> PapuaHardyNet: no
[17:03:21] <mst> PapuaHardyNet: stop. engage your brain.
[17:04:15] <feep> this is a fuckup by me
[17:04:22] <feep> I'm doing something the compiler can statically detect is broken
[17:04:33] <mst> feep: note that I have some code somewhere that has an if statement whose sole purpose is to emit "yeah, this has gone non-linear and if we carry on then frankly a segfault would be the best possible result because at least then we wouldn't be scribbling on random memory without anything stopping us, so we're just going to barf really hard now with an error that *hopefully* gives you more of a clue to the 
[17:04:39] <mst> problem than the alternative was"
[17:04:45] <feep> haha yeah
[17:04:55] <feep> "in conclusion, exit(1)"
[17:05:03] <PapuaHardyNet> feep, are you writing raw C code? i thought you were writing code in feeplang
[17:05:08] <feep> feeplang emits llvm ir
[17:05:12] <PapuaHardyNet> oh I see
[17:05:20] <feep> nothing here is C
[17:05:51] <feep> we're just mentioning C because LLVM is *barely* generic enough to not qualify as a C compiler anyway, so "llvm" and "clang" (llvm's C frontend) are basically synonymous
[17:05:56] <mst> but it has an optimiser written by C compiler people
[17:06:08] <feep> on paper llvm is generic, in practice it's a C backend with a fake moustache
[17:06:19] <mst> just like basically all the truly batshit compiler optimisers are
[17:06:21] <mst> bahahahaha
[17:06:41] <feep> yeah glhf writing a language where null access is well defined in llvm lol
[17:07:50] <feep> addrspace 1 casts, addrspace 1 casts everywhere
[17:08:53] <feep> ohey :stares at llvm ir doc: nevermind, you can do that with the data layout now
[17:08:55] <feep> suweet
[17:27:44] <dTal> LLVM is pretty generic
[17:28:10] <dTal> Julia compiles to machine code with LLVM and no one would accuse it of being like C

[22:22:54] <kuudes> otoburb, sure
[22:23:12] <kuudes> I am wondering if location pairs differ
[22:23:35] <otoburb> Can you give some examples? 
[22:24:15] <otoburb> I'd imagine the location pairing is so highly dependent on personal factors (e.g. support network "back home") that it would be difficult to easily compare.
[22:24:16] <kuudes> ie if the choices are new or old location, and location pairs are 1) france <- uruguay 2) norway <- spain 3) germany <- greece 4) california <- kansas 5) canada <- china
[22:24:53] <otoburb> I think citizenship also plays a huge role.
[22:25:17] <kuudes> well, lets presume you get eligible to permanent residency
[22:25:32] <kuudes> I mean, if you don't then indeed you have no choice
[22:25:36] <otoburb> If you added, for example, 6) usa <- china, then the US will foist all healthcare costs (at full charge, I believe) for your parents if you bring them into the country
[22:25:48] <otoburb> Canada, doesn't do that
[22:25:51] <kuudes> foist?

[22:26:32] <otoburb> In this case, the US will charge 100% of all healthcare costs for your parents if they are not already citizens
[22:26:40] <kuudes> yeah, I don't think it would be common you would be allowed to move your parents to the target location mostly
[22:26:41] <otoburb> Yes. There will be no medical, that I'm aware of, that will cover. 
[22:27:15] <otoburb> Well, in #5, Canada will allow that. The healthcare system will start to cover their healthcare if they immigrate.

[22:27:58] <otoburb> If you become a Canadian citizen (and even permanent resident - one step below) then I believe it's much easier to bring your parents in. 
[22:28:13] <kuudes> at least over here citizenship only goes down in generations, not up
[22:28:22] <kuudes> which has been a problem for some immigrants afaik
[22:28:23] <otoburb> The difference with Canada and the US is that the US will allow it, but still force you to pay 100% of their healthcare costs. 
[22:28:58] <kuudes> ie people moved from russia to finland, got citizenship, moved their grandma to finland, grandma got deported back to russia where there was no one there anymore
[22:29:10] <kuudes> same for some egyptians and georgians iirc
[22:29:19] <otoburb> Ouch. Well, yeah that would be a big deterrant to this idea of bringing parents over. 
[22:29:39] <kuudes> do people usually move their parents within usa?
[22:29:54] <otoburb> I have no idea. I'm not an American, and didn't grow up here. 
[22:29:57] <kuudes> ie if one moves from kansas to nyc and sets up there, will they then move their parents from kansas to nyc?
[22:30:06] <otoburb> Anecdotally, no they won't. 
[22:30:21] <otoburb> NYC is a HCOL city, so unless the parents are independently wealthy enough to pick up and move, they won't. 
[22:30:46] <kuudes> so why do we presume people would move their parents in the other cases?
[22:30:47] <otoburb> Also, since it's within the US (i.e. domestic travel), it's fairly easy enough to fly back to visit them. 
[22:30:52] <kuudes> isn't it just regular urbanization?
[22:31:22] <kuudes> well sure, you can cross the border from finland to russia, thats not the problem on normal times if you and your kids are russian citizens
[22:31:35] <kuudes> but presumably there is a strong preference to live in finland, not in russia
[22:31:51] <kuudes> so I am trying to square out what is the dominating factor
[22:32:22] <kuudes> ie people within eu sometimes talk about going to work in richer country but presume they will move back later on
[22:32:26] <otoburb> The dominating factor to continuing to live in the country your job(s) are in vs. go back to your birth country? 
[22:32:28] *** Quits: milanandreew (uid500468@user/milanandreew) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[22:32:37] <kuudes> and it seems to me there is a mistaken presumption here somewhere
[22:32:41] <kuudes> otoburb, yes
[22:33:11] <kuudes> ie we got now to that in 5 the new country is preferred
[22:33:19] <otoburb> That goes back to what I said before -- isn't it highly dependent on your personal circumstances? Seems like there won't be a dominant factor, other than perhaps generic "better economic opportunties until lifestage X"
[22:33:21] <kuudes> and in 4 it is the new country as well?
[22:33:44] <kuudes> I would think it would be rational to just maximize the locale's hdi where you reside
[22:34:11] <kuudes> ie insofar as it is sane to move from spain to norway to work in, then it is sane to stay in norway and live a norwegian life there
[22:34:26] <kuudes> re "ie if the choices are new or old location, and location pairs are 1) france <- uruguay 2) norway <- spain 3) germany <- greece 4) california <- kansas 5) canada <- china"
[22:34:48] <kuudes> it seems to me it would be quite mistaken for anyone to move back to the poorer / lower hdi country with the money
[22:35:07] <kuudes> if it wasn't surely people from high hdi countries would just get their moneys and move to lower hdi countries?
[22:36:36] <otoburb> I would speculate that if you were particularly successful, and if the HDI isn't super low, then there would be a great temptation to move back (big fish in a small pond). 
[22:36:53] <otoburb> If you are moderately successful in the higher-HDI country, you'd likely stay. 
[22:37:09] <kuudes> I mean, wouldn't that mean faang people should retire to kansas or something?
[22:38:31] <otoburb> Kansas vs. California is a little different from the other situations you listed. That's in the same country, speaking the same language. They can fly back easily, hence I'd imagine the answer would be "no" in that instance. 
[22:39:43] <otoburb> If the HDI in the birth country is low enough, then that temptation is mitigated by the attraction of rule-of-law, better healthcare, etc. I think the relative difference and (again) personal circumstances and preferences matter more when it comes time to make that decision. 
[22:39:59] <kuudes> well norway is still miles off from any other location
[22:40:13] <kuudes> ie if your kid is disabled, the government pays them to have a personal assistant etc
[22:40:21] <otoburb> And Spain doesn't?
[22:40:26] <kuudes> afaik
[22:40:29] <kuudes> at least finland doesn't
[22:40:47] <kuudes> finland is not a poor country and norway is something like double the richer
[22:41:20] <kuudes> like, it is otherwise the same but they just have investment returns as high as finnish public spending
[22:41:34] <kuudes> so they can do stuff like drill tunnels through mountains because fuck it
[22:41:57] <otoburb> If I had a child that was disabled, and if the quality of life overall would be better for us all in Norway, I'd stay. Pretty simple. 
[22:41:58] <kuudes> "meh, traffic is nuisance, lets move the roads underground"
[22:43:08] <kuudes> basicly norway can uphold finnish quality of life without any person there working at all
[22:43:20] <rmmh> kuudes: what do you mean 'move their parents'
[22:43:42] <otoburb> Well, Norway sounds awesome, other than the fact that you'd have to learn the language (which for some may be easy, for others very difficult). 
[22:43:43] <kuudes> rmmh, wait, could you expand?
[22:44:08] <otoburb> Plus you have to have lived there for 7 years out of the past 10 to qualify for Norwegian citizenship.
[22:44:44] <kuudes> yes, but we are talking about not-short gig
[22:45:00] <kuudes> ie indeed "move to your adult life to another state and then possibly move back"
[22:45:01] <rmmh> idk how immigration of parents works in the US
[22:45:12] <rmmh> but generally parents don't move, kids do

[22:45:20] <Robomot> image/webp (46 KB)
[22:45:21] <kuudes> rmmh, yeah, that is my understanding as well
[22:45:38] <otoburb> If you remove the (large) issue of obtaining citizenship in the target/latest country, and have future economic security (another large issue), then it boils down to .... personal circumstance (again), no? 
[22:45:57] <kuudes> I would think it is not rational to move away from the higher hdi location
[22:46:09] <kuudes> in most any circumstances. you could have some exceptional circumstances
[22:46:31] <kuudes> but clearly the higher hdi location usually has better standard of living generally
[22:46:53] <otoburb> I think you also have to take into account the relative difference in HDI between the birth and target country.
