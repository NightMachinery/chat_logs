[11:38:30] <user51> is http://0x0.st/oqjl.awk
[11:39:11] <user51> i'm trying to recursively insert a string into an array, but it seems like gawk makes it a variable instead of a sub-array
[11:39:22] <user51> is doing it even possible?
[11:41:15] <user51> https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Walking-Arrays
[11:41:20] <user51> maybe this is the answer, reading it now
[11:45:16] <Patsie> 'insert a string into an array' ?
[11:45:23] <Patsie> I'm not sure what you mean with that
[11:45:36] <Patsie> I'm reading the code, but that does not make sense to me
[11:45:43] *** Quits: malina (~malina@user/malina) (Quit: malina)
[11:45:53] <Patsie> the 'rec' function doesn't return anything, just calls itself
[11:46:13] <Patsie> and it doesn't assign anything (apart from an empty element to a key, because you reference it)
[11:46:30] <Patsie> so I'm not sure what that's supposed to do either
[11:46:49] *** Joins: lavaball (felix@31.204.155.215)
[11:46:58] <user51> recursively insert a string into an array, so rather than A[1] = "s", A[2] = "t" and son on, we have A["s"]["t"] and so on
[11:47:17] <Patsie> split("string", A, "")
[11:47:19] <Patsie> like that?
[11:47:32] <Patsie> ohw
[11:47:35] <Patsie> the other way around
[11:47:55] <Patsie> and what values do you want to assign to the indices?
[11:48:11] <Patsie> just all '1' ?

[11:49:54] <user51> just to be sure, gawk makes something like array[whatever] into a scalar instantly, no?
[11:50:16] <Patsie> no
[11:50:32] <Patsie> ohw, I mean yes it does
[11:51:51] <Patsie> if you reference A["s"], then A["s"] is assigned an empty value, but the index is now part of the array
[11:51:53] <user51> so basically, the problem is that i wanted to pass a sub-array into the recursive function, but what is supposed to be a sub-array becomes a scalar when you do array[something]
[11:52:41] <Patsie> # awk 'BEGIN { print ("s" in A); A["s"]; print ("s" in A) }'
[11:52:42] <shbot> Patsie: 0
[11:52:42] <shbot> Patsie: 1
[11:53:12] <Patsie> what are you _really_ trying to do?
[11:53:14] <user51> # gawk 'BEGIn { a[1] = 2; a[1][2] = 3 }'
[11:53:18] <user51> # gawk 'BEGIN { a[1] = 2; a[1][2] = 3 }'
[11:53:19] <shbot> user51: gawk: cmd. line:1: fatal: attempt to use scalar `a["1"]' as an array
[11:53:20] <shbot> user51: no output within the time limit
[11:53:53] <user51> basically, i was thinking you could use multidimensional arrays to build trees
[11:54:28] <Patsie> ohw, that's not easy
[11:54:52] <user51> i did that in nawk, but it's _really_ messy, and not very intuitive either.
[11:54:55] <Patsie> you can't just insert array elements willy-nilly. you really have to rebuild it again
[11:56:24] <user51> for example, if i wanted the child node of a tree, i had to write nodes[nodes[np,i]].
[11:57:09] <user51> you can transalte from C to some degree, but since we need to have array[index] everywhere, it's two things to worry about.
[11:57:53] <Patsie> yeah, you can't really do that, because awk doesn't know 'objects' and you can't really nest aray elements
[11:58:07] <user51> http://0x0.st/oqjn.txt
[11:58:35] <user51> i came up with something simplier yesterday, but it still requires 
[11:58:46] <user51> a string and calls to split() to extract fields
[11:59:56] <user51> somebody on the awk ML wrote a preprocessor so maybe there's still hope :)
[12:00:20] <user51> https://groups.google.com/g/comp.lang.awk/c/R9qn2Kz9Hzs
[12:05:38] <user51> fwiw, my simplier method suffers from indexing issues. e.g you might have child C, but you'll need to rebuild the 'list of children' strings.

[12:07:50] <user51> i figured that you could if you make each "element" uniform, say print it using %04x, the sub() approach could be slightly more reliable. but maybe it's a sign to use a language with better facilities for that.
