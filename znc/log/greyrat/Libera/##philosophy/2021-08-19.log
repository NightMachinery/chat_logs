[21:04:27] <pussipupu> If I'm drinking from the container I bought something in I want it to be glass to be fair
[21:04:35] <plankton> i find 32oz to be the ideal size
[21:04:44] <plankton> but i wont turn down a good 40oz now and then

[21:05:10] <plankton> they tried switching over to plastic bottles a few years back
[21:05:16] <plankton> everybody hated it so they stopped lol
[21:05:19] <pussipupu> But not two American pints or something
[21:05:25] <pussipupu> Honestly I lose track
[21:05:29] <plankton> yeah whatever
[21:05:33] <plankton> bottle big, much beer
[21:05:34] <plankton> wow
[21:06:08] <Samian> I'm going to make for myself a daily exercise where I say I'll do something and then I'll do it. Like "i'm going to raise my hand." And then I raise it. "I'm going to get a cup of water." and then I get it. I think it will help me have more control over myself
[21:06:24] <plankton> setting your sights high there, eh
[21:06:33] <Samian> hahaha real funny
[21:06:35] <pussipupu> Doing things for short defined times seems to work well for training the will to do the thing
[21:06:52] <pussipupu> Like start at just fifteen minutes, which is nothing, that's one joint you aren't smoking or whatver
[21:08:15] <Samian> I think its good to get in the habbit of doing you say you'll do. Then it'll be easier when you get to the task you don't want to do

[21:08:42] <plankton> i find it easier to want to do the tasks you have to do
[21:08:46] <plankton> but to each their own
[21:10:36] <pussipupu> I've been accused of having “sisu” (broadly grit or determination) for cycling to work in winter
[21:10:56] <pussipupu> I don't have a car, it's not like I have a choice to stop cycling because it's a bit chilly
[21:11:01] <plankton> much easier when you dont own a car
[21:11:04] <arryana> thank god i'm old and learned good habits before the time when people were all 'ooooh, my feeeeeelings' when stuff needed doing, and just did it.
[21:11:12] <plankton> humans are suckers for convenience
[21:11:24] <plankton> one must know thyself and thine limitations
[21:11:34] <pussipupu> There's a balance to it, feelings are important but are also a thing for cattle and loveplay sometimes
[21:11:40] <arryana> ^
[21:11:41] <plankton> lol ummm
[21:12:01] <plankton> ok i misread that
[21:12:02] <pussipupu> Dune reference, just realised that maybe nobody will get that
[21:12:08] <arryana> i remember
[21:12:10] <arryana> gurney halleck
[21:12:12] <plankton> i love dune but didnt get the reference
[21:12:13] <pussipupu> (In Dune it was “mood” IIRC rather than “feelings”)
[21:12:15] <pussipupu> Yep
[21:12:18] <arryana> you got extra points for that one
[21:12:30] <plankton> yeah digging deep for that, very nice
[21:12:34] <arryana> i think stephen king also quotes that in the long walk
[21:12:42] <plankton> i wanna get the litany against fear tattooed on me
[21:12:46] <pussipupu> I can't read King but props for that
[21:12:46] <arryana> or at least paraphrases it
[21:12:47] <plankton> still havent decided where tho
[21:13:17] <plankton> maybe my butt
[21:13:29] <arryana> i was lucky with that one, also due to the old man
[21:13:48] <plankton> ive read a bit of king. hes good, just so pulpy
[21:13:50] <arryana> i learned young that fear doesn't change anything, unless you let it.
[21:13:56] <Samian> plankton  what degree do you have?
[21:14:01] <plankton> the shining and pet semetary were excellent tho
[21:14:03] * plankton sighs
[21:14:10] <plankton> astrophysics
[21:14:17] <pussipupu> I must drink beer; beer is the mind killer; beer is the little death that brings total oblivion, I will face my beer; I will permit it to pass over and through me, and when it is gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path; the beer will be gone and only I will remain.
[21:14:23] <arryana> i think the stand was his best work, philisophically
[21:14:27] <arryana> hahah
[21:14:40] <plankton> pussipupu fuckin saved
[21:14:44] <arryana> is the inner eye the swirling toilet?
[21:14:45] <pussipupu> I might have stuffed the last bit, but that's the lesser known Litany Against Beer
[21:14:58] <pussipupu> From Goats, which was a great web comic
[21:15:05] *** Joins: Moyst (~moyst@user/moyst)
[21:15:23] <plankton> thats not the litany against beer tho
[21:15:32] <pussipupu> I suspect it's the upper sphincter of the stomach
[21:15:33] <Samian> can anyone explain this https://i1.wp.com/danwang.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bachelors.png?w=992&ssl=1
[21:15:42] <pussipupu> Which might presage a trip to the toilet...
[21:15:45] <arryana> of course it is.
[21:15:50] <arryana> what was i thinking
[21:16:18] <plankton> i didnt get a BA tho
[21:16:21] <plankton> BS
[21:16:32] * arryana wonders who is at the door
[21:16:59] <pussipupu> Probably the popo
[21:17:04] <arryana> haha
[21:17:19] <arryana> probably not, we're two of the most law abiding people alive
[21:18:49] <plankton> as if the cops care about that
[21:18:50] <Samian> arryana at following your own laws or the gov's laws?
[21:20:04] <arryana> it's projector cables
[21:20:07] <arryana> excellent
[21:20:31] <pussipupu> As in video projector?
[21:20:36] <arryana> yes
[21:20:48] <pussipupu> We're thinking of doing that so the TV doesn't exist when we're not using it
[21:21:05] <arryana> in the lounge and the master bedroom we have big pull-down screens hidden instead of tvs
[21:21:50] <arryana> we only have tvs in the guest rooms
[21:21:50] <pussipupu> Yeah, that's what we'd like for the living room but it might be tricky with the light fitting
[21:22:15] <pussipupu> Modern projectors that can go highly asymmetric might save us for this
[21:23:25] <arryana> that's what we use
[21:24:26] <arryana> neither of us are much in the way of tv watchers, but it's nice to put on documentaries and the repair shop occasionally
[21:25:13] <pussipupu> We watch Brooklyn 99 and craft shows
[21:25:24] <arryana> we've toyed with the idea of putting up an outdoor screen for summer nights, too
[21:25:31] <pussipupu> And some other stuff, but that's the big things
[21:27:55] <arryana> craft stuff is one of the reasons there's a tv in the craft room
[21:28:09] <arryana> but also because it could accommodate guests
