[04:51:53] <drmeister> Let's say I have an accessor where I can evaluate:    (imgui%:|DeltaTime| io)  and the setf form: (setf (imgui%:|DeltaTime| io) 1.0)
[04:52:06] <drmeister> I want to define an accessor imgui:delta-time where I can go:

[04:52:26] <drmeister> I'd like these accessors to be macros so that they get converted at compile time to the |DeltaTime| accessor.
[04:52:44] <mfiano> So, what is the question / where are you stuck?
[04:53:38] <drmeister> Should I be using define-setf-expander?  I've always struggled with that macro.

[04:56:26] <hayley> IIRC (defmacro imgui:delta-time (io) `(imgui%:|DeltaTime| ,io)) would work as a SETF place too.
[04:57:37] <drmeister> Yeah - sure - that works.
[04:57:51] <drmeister> You mean: (setf (fdefinition 'delta-time) #'imgui%:|DeltaTime|)
[04:58:00] <drmeister> and: (setf (fdefinition '(setf delta-time)) #'(setf imgui%:|DeltaTime|))
[04:58:19] <hayley> That'd work too, methinks.
[04:58:21] <mfiano> Yes. If you use a macro you lose runtime features

[05:03:11] <drmeister> borodust's bindings will be general to other common lisps.  Mine wraps the C++ API directly.

[07:12:25] <jeosol> Guest6112: what are you trying to achieve. Your entry function appears to be empty, just a call to (loop ...) and does nothing else
[07:13:45] <Guest6112> I intentionally removed a bunch of code there. I thought this was a problem with SBCL or my .asd definition. I've done some more digging and it turns out this segfault is actually happening because of sqlite, I'm trying to figure that out now
[07:14:36] <beach> Guest6112: Why are you trying to build an executable this early in the development process.
[07:14:37] <beach> ?
[07:14:54] <beach> It is much easier to debug things if you work interactively.
[07:15:29] <Guest6112> Oh I've done a ton of development on the REPL. I omitted a _ton_ of code from that example because I thought this was an SBCL or ASDF problem. Its actually something else.
[07:16:00] <beach> But that something else must have manifested itself during the interactive development work, no?
[07:16:33] <beach> Or are you saying that it happens only in the executable that you build, but not when you work at the REPL?

[07:17:36] <Guest6112> It only happens in the executable. I just figured it out -- I was using a defparameter at the top of the file (evidently a really bad idea) to connect to my sqlite database. I believe the defparameter happened, then went out of memory, then a query tried to refer to it.

[11:42:55] <beach> lucerne: No, code is not guaranteed to be compiled, but if you use COMPILE-FILE or COMPILE, at least minimal compilation has been performed.

[11:46:47] <beach> lucerne: By the way, there is not really any "code in a package" in Common Lisp.
[11:47:43] <amk> Howdy, does anyone know of a reasonably complete CL graphql library?
[11:52:03] <lucerne> Lycurgus: Isn‚Äôt an always available compiler what people call JITs?
[11:52:03] <lucerne> What I‚Äôm wondering is if CL compiles specialized versions of each functions for each tuple of input argument types. (This trick is used to great effect in Julia.)
[11:53:39] <beach> lucerne: No, for it to be JIT, it must recompile at run time.
[11:55:08] <beach> lucerne: The language has no opinion about that.  Can you give an example of what you mean?
[11:56:19] <hayley> It's possible to write a macro to do "type splitting", which achieves nearly the same effect (though the type is dispatched wholly at runtime with current implementations, whereas dispatch can be done at compile-time in Julia).
[11:57:43] <hayley> e.g. (defmacro split-on ((variable type) &body body) `(if (typep ,variable ',type) (progn ,@body) (progn ,@body))) and then (split-on (x fixnum) (+ x 2))
[12:00:58] <beach> lucerne: It would be uncommon for any Common Lisp implementation to compile a new version of a function when a new call to it is defined.  But this technique: http://metamodular.com/SICL/call-site-optimization.pdf is meant to make similar optimizations possible.
[12:02:22] <beach> lucerne: I don't know Julia, but what is their type system like?  I mean, if it has to compile a new function for each call site, inlining will work quite well.
[12:05:39] <beach> lucerne: Furthermore, it seems silly to make different versions of a function that does not depend on the "type" of its argument(s).
[12:07:36] <hayley> Doing type splitting (as I described) can be used to effectively hoist the dispatch on how to AREF and operate on the elements on an array. It can be useful for performance.

[12:10:13] <hayley> I am aware, thanks. Is that code silly to you? I think it's a pretty reasonable optimization, though I vaguely recall you mentioning that the SICL compiler should do some sort of hoisting automatically.
[12:10:40] <hayley> (I think the term is "hoisting" some test out of a function, but I could be mistaken.)

[12:14:00] <hayley> Yes, that sort of code would be pointless, but that is not what the SICL sequence functions do, nor is it what the Julia compiler does. I would say that the Julia compiler nearly does the same trick that you do with the sequence functions.

[12:14:17] <beach> I see.
[12:14:44] <hayley> However, from memory, Julia only compiles specialised variants of a function when the compiler would find it useful to call a specialised variant.
[12:15:17] <beach> That's not quite what lucerne said, which is why I was wondering.
[12:15:55] <beach> Like in (f 2) and (f 3), 2 and 3 can be the sae
[12:15:58] <beach> oops
[12:16:05] <beach> the same type or different types in Common Lisp.
[12:16:15] <hayley> You are referring to "What I‚Äôm wondering is if CL compiles specialized versions of each functions for each tuple of input argument types"?
[12:16:40] <beach> Yes, and the statement that Julia does.
[12:16:40] <hayley> I see.
[12:16:47] *** Joins: iamFIREc1 (~iamFIREcr@user/iamfirecracker)
[12:17:04] <beach> The key here being "argument TYPES".
[12:18:12] <hayley> Unless there is some very profitable constant folding to be done, I think a compiler would only bother to generate specialized code for what I called "layout times" in my regular expression compiler.
[12:18:16] <beach> And if Julia considers 2 and 3 to be the same "type" so that the same specialized function would be reused, then it would miss an opportunity for (defun f (x) (if (< x 3) <code-a> <code-b>))
[12:19:16] <beach> So I was waiting for lucerne to explain a bit more.
[12:20:38] <pjb> Furthermore, it's also silly to compile different versions of a function when the different types have actually the same size. C++ does this (because "type-safety"),  thus duplicating a lot of code uselessly.  You may need a function working on 8-bit types, one on 16-bit types, one on 32-bit types, and nowadays one on 64-bit types, but not care if it's an int or a char*‚Ä¶
[12:21:10] <pjb> Of course, in the case of lisp, all the values are references, so they're all the same width, and a single function is needed.
[12:21:12] <hayley> I have a list of useful types like (simple-array character 1) and (simple-array base-char 1), which I know the Lisp compiler can handle specially.
[12:21:34] <pjb> But references to them are the same!
[12:21:45] <hayley> pjb: Hence why I call them "layout types", as opposed to more abstract (and useful) types like STRING.
[12:25:42] <hayley> There is probably a better name for such types, but I intend to draw attention to how the type is used for optimization rather than, say, proving properties of a program.

[12:32:11] <beach> lucerne: Another question: If Julia compiles a different version of some callee for each combination of argument "types" on call sites, what happens when the callee is then redefined?  Does it find all call sites to determine how many versions of the new callee to compile?
[12:33:33] <lucerne> beach: I am not at all an expert on this subject. I basically know the highlevel concepts: dynamic languages are slow as they need to have runtime checks and can use less assumptions to hardcode optimizations, so Julia uses some heuristics to compile type-specialized versions of functions to overcome this limitation. Regarding constant folding (2
[12:33:33] <lucerne> vs 3), I know Julia sometimes does that, but I don‚Äôt the specifics. I think it would only do this if is inlining the function anyway. (Julia has some concept of recompiling functions when their dependencies change, so it can inline functions and still support live coding. I a, again not at all an expert. Use their docs, they are one of the best.
[12:33:33] <lucerne> They also have a zulip chat where you‚Äôll find more knowledgeable people.)
[12:34:27] <lucerne> The recompiling, btw, happens when the function is to be used, I think. They use the term ‚Äúinvalidated method.‚Äù
[12:35:46] <beach> lucerne: I am not interested enough to go read up on Julia.  I thought since you had opinions about how Common Lisp should do things, you might know.
[12:36:58] <lucerne> I was just wondering if CL did such optimizations.
[12:37:37] <beach> lucerne: Recompiling as dependencies change is very iffy.  If you have mutual recursion for instance.  Also, you can't fully recompile in Common Lisp.  You would need to keep a minimally compiled version around.  Even so, the amount of recompilation could be massive.
[12:37:39] <lucerne> Btw, can you elaborate on what you mean by a layout type? The layout of the data in the memory?
[12:38:03] <beach> lucerne: Common Lisp is a language.  Julia is a programming system.  You can't compare the two.
