[02:33:13] <talismanick> How do you version control a program based on a live image? Dump the config variables into a plaintext file in sexpr form and version control that?
[02:33:29] <White_Flame> your source code files should be canonical
[02:33:42] <White_Flame> your image shouldn't contain magic artifacts that only exist within it
[02:33:50] <White_Flame> but rather can be rebuilt from your source files
[02:34:13] <moon-child> 'your source code files should be canonical'  why?
[02:34:18] <moon-child> text is tyrrany
[02:34:28] <White_Flame> because you can version control them, and distribute them
[02:34:51] <White_Flame> and yeah, text is a subpar media for that manifestation
[02:34:58] <talismanick> I think I once saw an offhand comment about Smalltalk's Monticello VCS being built around object state, not text
[02:35:21] <White_Flame> sure, but CL doesn't have standard serialization of its internal state
[02:35:27] <talismanick> Everyone uses git, though, so this must've been "figured out" well enough by someone
[02:35:59] <talismanick> White_Flame:  standard as in "in the spec" or standard as in "everyone uses it" like bordeaux for multithreading?
[02:36:06] <White_Flame> and paring out one piece of a live system to be able to reload/import elsewhere in situ is very difficult if the system wasn't originally designed for it
[02:36:09] <White_Flame> spec
[02:36:15] <White_Flame> well, actually both :)
[02:36:21] <talismanick> oh :(
[02:37:09] <White_Flame> images were quite necessary back in the day when loading/compilation/GC were extremely slow, so it was basically just a hibernation mode, which then also allows you to copy & fork them wholesale

[02:37:27] <White_Flame> and most importantly, start up quickly
[02:37:58] <talismanick> Aren't files themselves relics with the same purpose for even more resource-constrained systems?
[02:38:01] <White_Flame> but yeah, extracting individual components from within that and have it remanifest exactly, is pretty difficult
[02:38:17] <moon-child> because cl has no referential transparency
[02:38:24] <moon-child> so the operation isn't super well-defined
[02:38:26] <White_Flame> source code is the specification for what should be in the image
[02:38:53] <White_Flame> and they serve a purpose greater than just fitting things larger than RAM, because they're persistent
[02:39:12] <White_Flame> it's generally a storage model, not a live model
[02:39:45] <White_Flame> even in single-address space systems that transparently include storage media, you still need notions of staging vs saved vs committed
[02:40:08] <White_Flame> however that actually takes place
[02:40:46] * talismanick dreams of a single address space, image-based system with VCS based on syntax trees instead of text
[02:41:47] <White_Flame> yep
[02:41:54] <talismanick> Where can I find more examples of this "manual JIT" technique?

[02:42:17] <White_Flame> but in order for those syntax trees to be copyable to other systems, and have them run it, they must be separable from the internal, intrinsic running state of your system
[02:42:33] <moon-child> talismanick: yes!
[02:42:33] <White_Flame> as standalone, self-contained artifacts
[02:43:38] <White_Flame> also, basically any macro does that sort of thing at compile-time.  To do it at runtime just adds another EVAL

[02:44:21] <White_Flame> (of course, compile-time also happens at runtime in lisp, from the perspective of most other languages)
[02:44:50] <talismanick> White_Flame: Well, there are cases where info needed for optimization isn't known until runtime
[02:45:03] <White_Flame> sure, and that doesn't come for free in lisps (yet)
[02:45:21] <White_Flame> what's known at codegen time is compiled in, and might include some runtime heuristics
[02:45:33] <White_Flame> if you need to recompile that based on new assumptions, you can do that, but the system has no means to do that for you
[02:45:59] <White_Flame> this is not a limitation of lisps; the runtimes could do full JIT recompilation based on that transparently, but none have done so yet

[03:28:24] <pjb> dash[m]: wrong. capability systems can scale worldwide in a single address space.
[03:28:54] <White_Flame> i don't think single address space is the correct term I was thinking of; that's more around lack of process boundaries, but I think there's a different term for one that includes all of its attached storage as directly addressable, too?
[03:29:14] *** Joins: xiews (~wxie@101.88.34.187)
[03:29:15] <White_Flame> or at least more specific to that
[03:29:22] <moon-child> dash[m]: regarding scaling--it is true that using multiple computers you can do things that are impossible with only one.  However that's not the question; the question is, what do you do _on_ one computer?  It's most efficient and direct to use a single address space
[03:29:40] <moon-child> erlang, for instance, which is probably the champion of both multicore and multi-machine scaling, uses a single address space
[03:29:44] <dash[m]> sure
[03:29:56] <dash[m]> well, it can, it doesn't have to
[03:29:58] <moon-child> White_Flame: re attached storage, I call it transparent persistence, and I think beach calls it orthogonal persistence
[03:31:17] <dash[m]> anyway if you're not receiving untrusted data then yes a simple design is good
[03:31:53] <White_Flame> you can have MMU protection without remapping the addresses

[03:32:33] <White_Flame> eg, still have the set of readable/writable/executable pages being configurable per process
[03:32:47] <dash[m]> White_Flame: sure, but that's not the distinction people typically refer to by "single address space OS"
[03:33:02] <White_Flame> depends.  The mill cpu is all about that sort of thing, too
[03:33:05] <moon-child> White_Flame: an 'address space' is a set of mappings.  A mapping is a relation from a region of virtual memory to region of physical memory associated with some permissions.  Change the permissions and you change the address space
[03:33:43] <moon-child> I think you may be referring to 'flat' memory space
[03:33:44] <White_Flame> well, you change features of the space, but you don't change the space itself ;)  as in its coordinate layout
[03:34:06] <White_Flame> having each process at its own 0x00000... base would be different spaces
[03:34:25] <White_Flame> because the same number means a different logical location in different process' spaces
[03:34:58] <White_Flame> and yeah, single address space with virtual memory would still have to do mapping, though all processes would share the same mapping, but different permissions
[03:36:04] <White_Flame> and as you say, the mapping defines the "space"

[12:18:06] <pjb> White_Flame: indeed. The protection can be implemented at the level of the object.  This is what is specified (implicitely) in the languages.  For example in C, char a[16],b[16],c[16],*p=b; *(p+17) is probably either in a or in c, but it is still illegal. The hardware could implement pointers and segments in such a way as to be able to perform those checks at run-time, so even if the language allow pointer arithmetic (even in assembler,
[12:18:07] <pjb> say), this would be protected.
