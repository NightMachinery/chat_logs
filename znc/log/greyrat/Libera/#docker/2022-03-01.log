[02:08:26] <bn_work> ok, so I think I have a suspicion of what may be causing my issue on this M1 Mac (ARM).  One of the images that was loaded for my compose file is using a `FROM openjdk:8u212-jre-alpine`, which I'm assuming at build time pulled the architecture it was built on?  If so, how can I check the arch pre-build time?
[02:09:09] <Led_Zeppelin2> i keep having docker networking issues. I created a bridge network. docker network --driver bridge foo. I then connect my docker container with --network foo. But for some reason, I can't connect to output with this....
[02:09:27] <Led_Zeppelin2> i keep getting Getaddrinfo: temporary faileure in name resolution. 
[02:09:31] <Led_Zeppelin2> is there a way to avoid this? 
[02:10:42] <bn_work> also, is there a way to make multi-arch builds?
[02:12:19] <tabakhase> Led_Zeppelin2 you may want to make sure they are created in the right order (for compose, see depends_on) -- aside from that sounds alright unless you are missing a part in your story on the when/why/how it breaks vs work or even if it ever worked or what ou are even trying (full commands, full errors, best a pastebin ;-) )

[03:02:14] <bn_work> ok, dumb question but for Docker Desktop v4.5.0 on M1 Mac, where does it store its volumes??  for ex. a volume `bar` created in `docker volume inspect foo` shows dirs like `"Mountpoint": "/var/lib/docker/volumes/bar/_data"` but /var/lib/docker doesn't even exist??  In DD Prefs there is a "Resources" > File Sharing section that talks about mounts but I'm assuming those are the older bind mounts.  Reading the referenced 
[03:02:14] <bn_work> https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/#file-sharing doesn't make it any clearer...

I'm running nextcloud:22-fpm-alpine behind an nginx-stable-alpine container with the config from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nextcloud/docker/master/.examples/docker-compose/insecure/mariadb/fpm/web/nginx.conf. My fpm access log only shows accesses from the nginx IP, not from the remote client. How do I fix this?
[03:21:49] *** Quits: XV8 (~XV8@2601:5cb:c001:50::c80f) (Quit: My MacBook has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[03:22:07] <BtbN> That's how that setup works. Only nginx will ever connect to fpm, and reverse proxy client requests.
[03:23:19] <ldericher> I know; but I also know there's something like `set_real_ip_from` and `proxy_set_header` to convey info about the original clients. Can't I use those in the FPM scenario?
[03:23:46] <ldericher> or similar instructions, for that matter
[03:26:32] *** Joins: t0mm13b (~t0mm13b@user/t0mm13b)
[03:27:36] <BtbN> nginx should be able to tell fpm about the IP it proxied the request for, yeah. But I never used nginx.
[03:29:50] <bn_work> ok... not the answer I was looking for https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38532483/where-is-var-lib-docker-on-mac-os-x but ugh... I guess that's because on Mac OS(X) it's all done in a (HyperKit?) VM
[03:36:57] <ldericher> well, tuns out nextcloud fpm is told about the proxied IP, but now it's stuck with a docker-proxy IP … >.<

[06:49:24] <tianon> bn_work: all openjdk:*jre-alpine* images were built over three years ago -- wouldn't really recommend actually using those at this point 🙈 -- if you *must* have Alpine, I'd suggest either https://hub.docker.com/_/eclipse-temurin or https://hub.docker.com/_/amazoncorretto both of which have actually supported builds for Alpine (although neither supports Alpine on any ARM arch)
[06:49:32] *** Joins: daniel-k3 (~daniel-k@fsf/emeritus/daniel-k)
[06:50:00] <tianon> my experience with the many Java variants is that actual Alpine support is complicated (see Project Portola for the original OpenJDK porting project that eventually led to "real" 17+ builds) and that ARM support is a bit complicated as well
[06:50:17] <tianon> Temurin technically supports ARM, but the builds often lag behind other architectures

[18:56:48] <tabakhase> GyrosGeier nothing directly "inbuild" - but you just pull the files out, and throw em back in (where the back-in sadly is a little complicated as you need a dummy-container to cp into to have volumes be "there and filled" on first boot of the application
[18:58:27] <tabakhase> that said, if application offers its own method, thats usually to use (say, example mysqldump) - and to ship that in/out you can just use STDIN/OUT alla "docker exec .... dump... > fileonmydisk.sql"
