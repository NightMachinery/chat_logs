[02:54:58] <midnite> quick question: how unsafe is it to send a pdf with banking info by email? my email provider tells me that SSL works with the recepient; does that make it any safer?
[02:55:08] <KryptoK> usually it is the second shot that bothers people
[02:55:33] <Lvl4Sword> midnite, SSL/TLS does nothing for anything at-rest. Just in transit.
[02:55:42] <tangy> midnite, unencrypted email is a post card
[02:55:49] <KryptoK> well it depends on how safe both your emails are
[02:56:33] <midnite> the recepient works at an insurance company, and presumably is equipped to deal with financial info, assuming their IT department is competent
[02:56:46] <midnite> I'm using an email service I pay for and trust to be reasonably secure and private
[02:56:53] <Hash> fact that smtp is plaintext bugs me

[03:08:18] <Hash> By the way, keep in mind that SMTP encryption is just protection on transit: it doesn't hide the email content from any mail server in the path and it does not do anything to authenticate the sender.
[03:08:24] <KryptoK> that is how google has made so much money.  Do you think they get rich off giving your fee services

[03:12:57] <KryptoK> if you want to you can set up a local dns server like a pihole and use unbound and resolve your dns queries at the top

[03:15:27] <KryptoK> there is dns over tls
[03:15:32] <tangy> yeah, I have some vacay coming up, so I can make some real headway on this project more then
[03:15:39] <Hash> DNS over TLS (2016) and DNS Queries over HTTPS (2018)
[03:15:43] <KryptoK> you still have to trust the dns serice provider
[03:16:19] <KryptoK> at least if you use a third party dns service they don't have your account info on file
[03:16:24] <tangy> pfblocker-ng - thx for that
[03:16:34] <Hash> With DNS over TLS (DoT), the original DNS message is directly embedded into the secure TLS channel. From the outside, one can neither learn the name that was being queried nor modify it.
[03:16:50] <KryptoK> they know an ip address has gone all these diff places but they may not have your name
[03:17:14] <Hash> DoH is essentially HTTPS, the same encrypted standard the web uses, and reuses the same port number (tcp/443). Web browsers have already deprecated non-secure HTTP in favor of HTTPS. That makes HTTPS a great choice for securely transporting DNS messages.
[03:18:31] <Hash> A draft for DNS over QUIC (DNS/QUIC) also exists

[03:18:39] <secbot> ^ draft-huitema-quic-dnsoquic-07
[03:18:49] <KryptoK> pfblocker-ng is something you usally use on a pfsense firewall.
[03:20:56] <KryptoK> it is made to sinkhole lists of malicious ip addresses and domains.  Some of the lists it offers has ads and trackers too.  You can block them as well.  A pihole is probably a much cheaper option.  You can run it on a Raspberry pi.
[03:24:47] <Hash> Ok
[03:24:48] <Hash> Guys
[03:24:50] <Hash> I don't get this
[03:24:58] <Hash> An administrator is setting up a Windows terminal server. Which of the following settings should the administrator modify to increase server security? (Choose two.)
[03:25:15] <Hash> One of the correct answers is: Put the terminal server into the router's DMZ
[03:25:22] <Hash> Block all unused ports on the LAN smart switch
[03:25:38] <Hash> WTF does this have to do with server security
[03:25:55] <Hash> I obviously picked answers related to the server stuff. Nope. Who the hell writes these questions?
[03:26:09] <Hash> Why would putting something in DMZ make it more secure?
[03:26:33] <KryptoK> I don't think it makes it more secure in and of it's self
[03:26:50] <KryptoK> you can open up only the ports that are needed to run that service
[03:27:01] <Hash> In computer security, a DMZ or demilitarized zone (sometimes referred to as a perimeter network or screened subnet) is a physical or logical subnetwork that contains and exposes an organization's external-facing services to an untrusted, usually larger, network such as the Internet.
[03:27:06] <KryptoK> it also segments it from your local area network
[03:27:17] <Hash> Ritgh
[03:27:39] <KryptoK> if anything it secures the lan from a potentially compromised ts
[03:27:43] <Hash> What I know of DMZ is, if you need to run a public facing server or something, but don't need that server to be talking to your internal network, put him into dmz
[03:27:50] <Hash> how is that more secure? I don't understand.
[03:28:05] <KryptoK> good rule of thumb
[03:28:34] <Hash> >>
[03:28:36] <Hash> In this case, the hosts most vulnerable to attack are those that provide services to users outside of the local area network, such as e-mail, Web and Domain Name System (DNS) servers. Because of the increased potential of these hosts suffering an attack, they are placed into this specific subnetwork in order to protect the rest of the network should any of them become compromised.
[03:29:09] <KryptoK> anything public facing is more vulnerable to attack
[03:29:09] <Hash> Oh god they worded it all wrong. I know all this. I know it. Have for years.

[05:26:32] <bn_work> hi, we have a server with a cert issued from an internal signing CA, the machine (Mac OSX 10.15.7) has the Root + Signing CA certs installed in KeyChain.app and marked as "Trust All".  However, when in Chrome v92, it refuses to proceed with `NET::ERR_CERT_INVALID` with no way to proceed when one clicks Advanced, _unless_ you (ridiculously) type the `thisisunsafe` "cheat code"

[06:22:26] <blinux> That is something else for preventing spam which is good to know about. I remember somebody telling me about one of those before.
[06:22:29] <Hash> spf record would be a txt record in your domain records that limits, dkim is basically pki for emails
[06:22:33] <Hash> pk*
[06:22:58] <blinux> I'm not sure how to prevent the sending of an unencrypted email though. That would be more complicated
[06:23:22] <electr0n> oh, hmm.
[06:23:50] <blinux> You would need a more complicated protocol, or a trusted domain list or something.
[06:24:00] <Hash> So for example, my dns record for spf would be v=sp1 includes:servers who can send mails
[06:24:02] <blinux> I'm going to write down the DMARC/DKIM/SPF though.
[06:24:23] <Hash> _dkim is a txt record holding your public key you generated a pair for your email server/domain
[06:25:36] <skill> blinux: you looking to filter emails that are pretending to be from a particular domain or you looking to validate the key used to encrypt the content of the email?
[06:25:40] <Hash> If this isn't what you want, and you want to drop emails that do not contain a public key in text or something, you'd have to create a filter rule in your email server or your spamassassind config
[06:26:41] <skill> electr0n: yo
[06:26:51] <blinux> I am looking to prevent the sending or recieving of any email which is not encrypted so only the sender and receiver can read the emails. Knowing it came from the person that it claims to come from is the second concern I would also add.
[06:27:12] <Hash> That would be DKIM then
[06:27:30] <skill> DKIM doesn't validate encrypted content, it validates the validation of who the sender is
[06:27:34] <blinux> DKIM is making sure it comes from who it appears to come from, the second one.

[06:29:45] <Hash> It prevents the alteration of content of the email during transit
[06:30:16] <blinux> One way to do it could be to use a new protocol, or have a list of domains which have the same rule to reject emails that are not encrypted with a public key. Though I'm not exactly sure how an email server could tell if a message is encrypted with the included public key or not, without decrypting it. Maybe it can.
[06:31:11] <Hash> That's all it does. It doesn't encrypt your emails or validate whether they are encrypted or not.
[06:31:29] <blinux> I think the super safe way to make sure a message is decrypted is to paste the encrypted received text into the decryption program. Only way to be sure it is locally decrypted.

[06:34:09] <blinux> There is no way to really know that with webmail.

[06:48:26] <Hash> the same server can host both services, sure.
[06:48:29] <blinux> Just make sure to connect with TLS IMAP/POP3. The part you can't control is whether your email server uses TLS SMTP to send to the other email server.
[06:49:03] <Hash> The part I meant end to end, was between mail servers. for example, exim is a popular MTA (mail transfer agent)
[06:49:15] <Hash> It sends and recieves emails. Stores them on the server.
[06:49:25] <Hash> Then you use your client to get the mails over pop3 or imap.
[06:49:33] <blinux> I guess I would hope they always do, but I don't see them talking about it. Because maybe they don't since they are afraid the email will bounce. There should be a setting saying to send only using TLS and make it bounce if not.
[06:50:06] <Hash> Just disable PLAIN and enable only STARTTLS login session

[07:05:44] <ajak> should be pretty easy to see why not communicating over plaintext is better than communicating over plaintext..
[07:08:46] <blinux> Wait, would would even be the point of start TLS? Isn't there a standard port for TLS and the email server could just try to connect to that? If it fails, then that is it. The email will bounce. And, even if somebody were to setup a non-TLS listen on a port normally used for TLS, it won't work and the transmission will fail.
[07:09:36] <blinux> I haven't seen the vulnerability yet, but just from a need point of view I don't see the need for startTLS.
[07:09:41] <ajak> i don't know the history behind starttls but i imagine it was a good idea in the past but probably not anymore, i agree it seems rather stupid
[07:10:21] <ajak> but yes, basically there's SMTP and IMAP and their own ports and then there's SMTPS and IMAPS (TLS, note the S) on different ports

[07:33:42] <Hash> EEP!
[07:34:26] <Hash> There is really no protection against quantum cracking in 10-20 years (neverminds the super secret stuff gov works on that no one even knows about)
[07:34:43] <Hash> So all your data you are worried about encrypting right now will be vuln in due time.
[07:34:51] <Hash> that's what scares me.
[07:35:10] <KryptoK> Where I work we have HIPAA compliant.  We have a mail portal to ensure emails are encrypted.  Let's say an attourney sent client med data from their gmail account and it went through TLS then there was technically no disclosure.
[07:35:41] <Hash> Oh, yeah. I know hippa.i hjad to setup medisoft systwems for my dad's clinic when he had one.
[07:36:01] <Hash> i had to do the whole compliane and security and everthing
[07:36:12] <KryptoK> if they are using gmail I personally don't know if it really matters if was encrypted in trasit
[07:36:38] <Hash> You can use gmail. Just use gnupg or another encryption addon.

[07:37:53] <Hash> sure company security policy compliance might require it, sure.
[07:37:59] <Hash> But we're talking the regular public.
[07:38:09] <KryptoK> I can't believe using gmail to transmit PHI is not a HIPAA violation.
[07:38:35] <Hash> They don't do that anymore do they?
[07:38:55] <Hash> For example, all the institutions, clinics, doctors, they only send you an email, hey there's an update.

[07:39:16] <Hash> Nothing goes through email anyore
[07:39:22] <Hash> I think it is a violation.
[07:39:23] <KryptoK> Some small attournies use gmail and yahoo

[22:19:16] <Hash> While fiddling with different settings in VirtualBox I also changed the type of emulated chipset from default PIIX3 to ICH9 et voilà – download speed was suddenly on par with the upload! With bridged networking, the speed on the guest is about the same as on the host. Speed on NAT networked hosts got bumped to about 200 Mbit/s (i.e. more than 10× boost).
[22:19:47] <Hash> I see. I'll try that. I was thinking of checking out ICH9. Bridged mode is always faster than NAT for some reason in any vm.
