[00:32:06] <Sammitch> for every table you've imported that has an auto_increment column you'll need to go to the old server, get the current value, and reconfigure the table on the new server accordingly

[00:34:22] <da_wunder> and what I have used instead, you might ask - well ulid or uuid (different versions) depending the use case
[00:35:32] <da_wunder> with all those it is really nice that you could _know_ that ID before that is persinted to database

[00:39:05] <Sammitch> the trouble with sequence generators is that they are singletons embedded in the database, and a serious bottleneck for scaling.
[00:39:50] <da_wunder> and you cannot "know" what that id is before actual insert
[00:40:12] <Sammitch> that is not a problem worth worrying about, IMHO
[00:40:59] <Sammitch> that is why there are transactions and functions to return the IDs that was generated
[00:41:25] <__adrian> can simplify things though.
[00:41:39] <da_wunder> for me it's eg. testing is really hard without actual database
[00:41:49] <__adrian> e.g., openstack gives you resource ids (uuids) without making you wait for those records to be persisted
[00:42:49] <Sammitch> gross
[00:43:27] <da_wunder> why, gross?
[00:43:42] <__adrian> makes things snappy and less tightly coupled
[00:43:50] <da_wunder> ^
[00:43:52] <Sammitch> sacrificing consistency for performance
[00:44:03] <__adrian> there's no consistence sacrifice
[00:44:07] <__adrian> *consistency
[00:44:09] <da_wunder> ^
[00:44:41] <Sammitch> "without making you wait for those records to be persisted" sure sounds like sacfrificing consistency to me
[00:44:41] <__adrian> worst case, something blows up and the record is never created.
[00:44:53] <__adrian> it won't be something else. it won't collide.
[00:44:55] <da_wunder> you really should look what ulid and uuid are
[00:45:57] <Sammitch> non-colliding IDs does not make up for "oops I lost that data I told you I was persisting"
[00:46:31] <__adrian> well, this example was creating a resource
[00:46:59] <__adrian> but so long as the contract is clear - "yep, i'll do this" and not "yep, this is done"

[00:47:35] <Sammitch> if it's "here is the resource ID I am going to create asynchronously, and a job ID to query the status" that's a different beast.
[00:47:37] <da_wunder> ulid is time based like uuid v1, but it has better indexing and collisions see- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier#Collisions
[00:48:14] <__adrian> yeah, is most attractive with a sequential uuid
[00:48:29] <__adrian> like v6/v8/whatever they're calling the proposal now
[00:48:38] <Dr-007> sammitch, i got a query that will fix it: SELECT setval('voice_functions_id_seq', MAX(id), true) FROM voice_functions
[00:49:04] <Dr-007> i dont know why the import didnt work correctly tho. its just a bunch of sql queries i exported from mysql and then reimported to postgresql
[00:49:28] <Sammitch> again, max(id) is not a suitable setting for "fixing" your sequence generator
[00:49:51] <Dr-007> again?

[02:42:32] <on3pk> Is there a way to "normalize" strings?  I have a string with a unicode character in it that is being represented by \u00e9.  I'm wondering if there is a way to replace the \u00e9 with the actual unicode character
[02:43:28] <Sammitch> is it a JSON string?
[02:43:52] <Sammitch> because if so just decode the JSON normally
[02:44:22] <on3pk> oh ok.  Yes, it is in JSON
[02:44:46] <on3pk> I really haven't encountered unicode in other things I've done before.  Thanks.
[02:45:04] <Sammitch> you can make json_encode() not escape high-order UTF8 codepoints, but the escaping is default because it's less susceptible to problems in transport
[02:45:44] <Sammitch> and the correct reference would be "decode unicode escape sequences", not "normalize"
[02:47:48] <on3pk> well there are other things too, but they're all in JSON so I'm wondering if they're encoded for the same reason
[02:48:54] <Blondie101010> parse the JSON with a proper tool, like json_decode($arr, true)
[02:49:18] <Blondie101010> not $arr but $json

[02:50:11] <Sammitch> if you see as JSON string just pretend it's unreadable by human eyeballs until you run it through `json_decode()` :P
[02:52:05] <Blondie101010> if you still see similar codes then either you need additional flags, or actually have such data
[02:52:15] <on3pk> I can do that, sammitch
[02:52:34] <on3pk> They're names, and the names will have accents and stuff
[02:52:49] <Blondie101010> so what?
[02:53:02] <Blondie101010> just encode and decode it properly
[02:54:06] <on3pk> that is the plan
[02:55:04] <Blondie101010> use utf-8 everywhere
[02:55:11] <Blondie101010> that will avoid a lot of problems
[03:00:35] <Sammitch> and just a general tip for dealing with text encodings: always explicitly know the encoding of your text. anything that purports to "detect" text encoding is simply guessing.

[17:19:09] <Bushcat> Hi, I logged into phpmyadmin, although it shows mariadb server in phpmyadmin main page, but I do not see any of my databases or tables in left pane
[17:20:10] <AllenJB> Bushcat: Most likely a permissions issue in mariadb. Have you GRANTed the user access to any databases?
[17:20:31] <TinoDidriksen> Channel #phpmyadmin exists.
[17:20:34] <AllenJB> Bushcat: You may get better support in a maria or phpmyadmin specific channel
[17:20:55] <Bushcat> AllenJB,  in mysql client for MariaDB i have all the permissions and I can do everything when I am using mysql client in command line
[17:22:02] <biberu> that's as good a reason as any to not use phpmyadmin

[23:08:55] <__adrian> defined "weird"
[23:09:03] <last1> when doing rename across partitions in a try/catch statement, even if the copy succeeds, it throws the exception saying operation not permitted
[23:09:21] <last1> so you are left with a successful copy of the file at destination, but exception thrown
[23:09:48] <__adrian> rename() doesn't throw
[23:10:36] <__adrian> what's the exception you see?
[23:10:40] <last1> so then what throws it when you do try { $success=rename('src', 'dest'); }
[23:10:42] <last1> one sec
[23:11:15] <__adrian> no idea. might be a custom error handler.
[23:11:59] <teresko> had to rechec the fine-manual, but, year, rename() only returns false on failure
[23:12:02] <__adrian> but more broadly speaking, i don't often see an actual need to rename() within php, and "across partitions" sounds even more questionable.
[23:13:12] <teresko> .... well ... unless you are building a "shell" that you want to add to a Wordpress site, that for some reason was not already pre-shelled
[23:13:33] <__adrian> also note might have something to do with the filesystem.
[23:13:54] <last1> https://pastebin.com/UUvi0iqh
[23:14:00] <last1> yes it's a custom error handler
[23:14:11] <__adrian> ErrorException  ← custom error handler
[23:14:31] <last1> and on FreeBSD system directories are on separate partitions by default, vs Linux where it's all on /
[23:14:45] <teresko> last1: is that, per chance, a file that has been uploaded via HTML form?
[23:14:46] <last1> so uploaded files go to /tmp then they are moved to /usr for example
[23:14:52] <last1> yes
[23:15:02] <teresko> https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.move-uploaded-file.php
[23:15:07] <teresko> that's what this is for
[23:15:34] <__adrian> inndeed, DO NOT USE rename() for renaming uploaded files
[23:15:43] <__adrian> it's NOT intended/safe
[23:15:51] <last1> yes, I use that in the first step to move to a staging temp area also under /tmp
[23:16:07] <last1> then I move it from tmp staging area to user's homedir in /home
[23:16:14] <last1> using rename
[23:16:23] <last1> so I guess I need to stop doing that
[23:16:35] <__adrian> "user's homedir"  is this some kind of homegrown file manager  :/
[23:16:36] <last1> right now I'm seeing the copy part succeeding yet the exception thrown
[23:16:51] <last1> adrian: sort of, I implement webdav
[23:17:25] <AllenJB> If the file is actually "renamed", could it be a secondary operation such as setting permissions / mtime, or deleting the original file, that's causing the warning?
[23:17:40] <__adrian> yeah. wild, unfounded guess: something about whatever filesystem and/or system calls is different on bsd and you hit the problem, but then something retries a different way
[23:17:58] <__adrian> actually that might eb more likely AllenJB
[23:18:11] <last1> AllenJB: I forgot to mention, the origin gets removed as well
[23:18:12] <__adrian> is the original file still there after the rename()?
[23:18:21] <teresko> probably ZFS
[23:18:23] <__adrian> note, after the rename() but BEFORE the request ends
[23:18:31] <last1> copy succeeds, remove succeeds, even chmod is fine
[23:18:42] <last1> but I get that error lol
[23:18:52] <__adrian> because tmp uploaded files are normally removed at the end of the request regardless
[23:18:54] <last1> teresko: this is on UFS
[23:19:26] <teresko> oh ... shit ...  __adrian  was right
[23:19:34] <teresko> last1: look at your damned error message
[23:19:38] <teresko> no the top bot the bottom
[23:19:42] <teresko> you have an error handler
[23:20:11] <Sammitch> aren't uploaded files usually just bare file handles?
[23:20:44] <__adrian> $_FILES has the actual temp name of the uploaded file
[23:20:47] <__adrian> no handle

[23:22:27] <last1> I fixed via this ugly hack: https://pastebin.com/E5T4M0bT
[23:23:40] <teresko> the ugliest part to me seems to be the `$this->delete()` line
[23:24:18] <Sammitch> write a simple test script for this "renaming across partitions" and then run it under strace to see what the issue is
[23:24:33] <teresko> and disable error handler
[23:24:44] <Sammitch> the underlying problem is either something you need to fix, or it's a bug that should be reported
[23:25:15] <Sammitch> papering it over with your ugly hack will bite you eventually
[23:26:12] <last1> Sammitch: let me try that quickly

[23:34:07] <FightingFalcon> whats the php function to convert non-latin url's to utf-8?
[23:34:23] <FightingFalcon> utf8_encode?
[23:35:13] <TinoDidriksen> iconv() or mb_convert_encoding() or Intl, and you have to know what you're converting from.

[23:37:35] <FightingFalcon> cyrillic for example
[23:38:41] <last1> https://pastebin.com/Sdh0SmBr
[23:39:05] <last1> so running the code as root, rename works fine, running as uid 80 throws the error on that chmod
[23:39:15] <last1> but as you can see var_dump reports still true
[23:39:39] <last1> and the destination file is properly owned by uid 80
[23:41:16] <last1> sorry, error on chown
[23:43:49] <TinoDidriksen> Only root can chown.
[23:45:02] <Sammitch> FightingFalcon: do not use utf8_encode or decode, they are awful functions that only translate between latin1/western european and utf8, so your cyrillic will be destroyed
[23:45:15] *** Quits: fef (~thedawn@user/thedawn) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[23:45:50] <Sammitch> also, if the URL maps to an actual filesystem path you should check what encoding your FS uses
[23:45:57] <TinoDidriksen> last1, https://www.php.net/chown "Only the superuser may change the owner of a file." - but https://www.php.net/chgrp allows changing group to another that the user is a member of.
[23:46:19] <last1> but I don't use chown, I only use rename
[23:46:25] <last1> I guess rename calls chown
[23:46:36] <last1> in which case it would be a php bug
[23:46:44] <FightingFalcon> thanks
[23:47:04] <Sammitch> rename doesn't work across FS boundaries, it is an implicit copy+delete
[23:47:34] <Sammitch> likely handled by the OS, not PHP

[23:48:56] <Sammitch> TinoDidriksen++
[23:49:12] <last1> alright, so then I should either remove the try/catch
[23:49:22] <last1> or leave it and check for the existence of the file like I do now
[23:49:58] <last1> I think I'll leave the current code, I'm glad I got to the bottom of it
[23:50:00] <TinoDidriksen> Only use rename() if you know it's to the same mount point. Otherwise, it's best to do copy() + unlink().
[23:50:23] <last1> alright, thank you everyone
[23:50:56] <Sammitch> maybe also consider if you really need to be moving things across FS boundaries in the first place
[23:51:36] <last1> well, the file uploaded goes to /tmp by default
[23:51:46] <last1> and I need to get it out of there
[23:51:59] <Sammitch> change the tempdir in your php config
[23:52:06] <last1> tmp is on a separate nmve device that can handle a few initial operations
[23:52:19] <last1> and when it's ready I can move it to its final destination
[23:52:34] <last1> so there's an underlying hardware reason too
[23:53:38] <Sammitch> so then it's there by design and you know for certain you need to use TinoDidriksen's solution for this specific move.
[23:54:01] <Sammitch> don't. use. the. kludge.
[23:54:09] <TinoDidriksen> If it's uploaded, move_uploaded_file() exists. Dunno if that has the same quirks.
