[04:15:16] <bremner> it's a bit code golfy, but is there a simpler way to do (format nil "~{~A~^.~}" (make-list 128 :initial-element "a"))
[04:55:18] <mfiano> So you want a string of a's followed by a period?
[04:55:26] <mfiano> bremner: ^
[04:55:28] <aeth> http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/22_cgd.htm
[04:57:30] <aeth> this almost gets there, but it has a trailing period. (format nil "~128{a~^.~}" "a")
[04:57:39] <mfiano> I don't know why you'd start with a list
[04:58:16] <mfiano> THat is going to cons an un-needed list that doesn't represent the data you want
[04:58:24] <mfiano> (make-string 129 :initial-element #\a) and then modify the last element

[05:27:31] <bremner> mfiano: no, the format is interleaving '.' between the a's
[05:28:55] <mfiano> Oh right. So (loop :with string = (make-string 128 :initial-element #\a) :for i :below 128 :by 2 :do (setf (aref string i) #\.)) or something
[05:29:33] <bremner> yikes
[05:29:52] <mfiano> That will only allocate the storage needed.
[05:30:32] <mfiano> Well sure, it is a bit more verbose without an abstraction/library, but I'm not quite sure what your intentions are exactly.
[05:31:14] <bremner> I'm writing unit tests, so clarity is paramount (if subjective)
[05:32:10] <mfiano> Stick it in a constant out of the way. That's as clear as can be.

[14:43:52] <bremner> aeth: yeah, replace t with nil and I think it follows the spex
[14:45:05] <bremner> Since ~{ wants a list
[14:46:59] <bremner> A different letter than a would be less confusing, but that's my fault
[14:49:15] <edgar-rft> use emojis instead :-)
[15:08:20] <bremner> oh. my idea of nil is wrong apparently. hmm.

[15:43:54] <bremner> I have a bit of a puzzle with dynamic scope. in https://paste.debian.net/1234039/  gpg-file-as-string relies on a parameter (special variable), and inlining the trivial function %read-gpg seems to break things. For context the whole file is https://paste.debian.net/1234040/

[16:23:53] <bremner> *data-source-gnupghome*, in https://paste.debian.net/1234041/
[16:24:27] <bremner> actually, it gets more complicated, it seems to only be a problem when running tests in sb-rt, so I'll have to try to narrow it down
[16:25:44] <beach> Yes, that sounds good, because what you said is very confusing.  You said your function has a special variable as a parameter, but then you gave a totally different name that doesn't appear in your code at all.
[16:26:22] <bremner> ack. My attempt to extract a minimal example was not too successful.
[16:39:36] <bremner> welp. The good news is that it was a silly mistake in doing the actual inlining. The identifier "location" meant different things in different functions.
[16:40:44] <beach> Yes, when you inline manually, you need to replace the parameters of the inlined function with the argument forms. 
[16:41:31] <bremner> I _should_ know that, but apparently I am sometimes too lazy for my own good.
