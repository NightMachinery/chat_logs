[02:06:15] <pyzozord> phogg: why do you think that would be better? from my user's point of view it's more troublesome to remember to exit nested shells
[02:06:31] <edk> phogg: yes. they also can't be destroyed or exactly duplicated!
[02:06:56] <phogg> pyzozord: if it's a rare event, having no deep nesting and being used only in some dirs, you are pretty likely to know when you are done with a context

[02:10:39] <pyzozord> phogg: following that idea I don't need to override cd at all, I can just write a function called "nest" that will do the nesting on demand and then exit it manually. I think the whole point of the idea was that this happened "automatic" so that I as a user don't need to think about it. I just enter a certain directory and I magically have aliases and functions available that make sense within this scope 
[02:10:45] <pyzozord> and whenever I change directory all that goes away - I don't need to pay any attention to it

[02:11:49] <pyzozord> phogg: that's not the tricky part, I can detect when user leaves the scope and call exit. The tricky part is passing the destination to parent shell in a nice way that doesn't involve named pipes (if possible) or temp files (that's really bad, don't want to go for that)
[02:12:03] <phogg> pyzozord: yes, like I said, that's the tricky part

[02:12:59] <phogg> Also, temp files are not bad. Everything is a file. Temp files are the original UNIX IPC. You'd be amazed at how much mileage you can get out of the clever application of this idea.

[06:45:38] <Friithian> I've never had that issue before, no idea what caused it

[06:45:49] <Friithian> god I hate exfat
[06:46:20] <litheum> are you using fuse for that?

It would be simple enough to remove the code that excludes them if that's what you really want, but then why FAT, why not a more sane filesystem?

The thing is I want this spawned process be run in the background and by closing the terminal it doesn't canceled. Is there a mechanism to doing so?

[09:25:32] <larryv> !disown
[09:25:32] <greybot> nohup is a hacky wrapper that will execute a process while redirecting its output and preventing SIGHUP from reaching it (some implementations ignore additional signals). In bash, you probably want disown instead: ''command ... & disown''. Alternately, run your commands inside screen or tmux.

[09:34:55] <Toxmi> larryv, right I couldn't use that actually I need to make a process with those two command. I instead use tmux and end up something like this:

[18:24:03] <earnestly> That SE post is absurd
[18:25:58] <llua> interactively, $1 is most likely unset so it expands to nothing, and xargs appends a line from stdin to echo's argument list

[18:27:02] <earnestly> Although I admit understanding how wait -n and wait relate can be a bit confusing if a key piece of knowledge is missing; that bash maintains a job list with completed states which remain until wait -n or wait is called to remove them

It does ths rapidly another three times so that now four 'cmd's are running.  The loop will then block on wait -n until one of those four are complete

[18:33:08] *** Joins: stevenm_ (~stevenm@stevenm.keele.netcentral.co.uk)
[18:33:46] <earnestly> Helmholtz1: xargs is the wrong tool because you're now introducing a pipe, over which needs data to be properly serialised and deserialised for xargs to handle.  Also xargs -P is not portable and one-liners does not elegance make
[18:34:38] *** Joins: Gooberpatrol66 (~Gooberpat@user/gooberpatrol66)
[18:34:43] <earnestly> bsd/linux xargs does have -0 which is useful in handling data across the pipe if nul termination is acceptable
[18:35:59] <earnestly> Helmholtz1: E.g. xargs understands quotes (in its own language), that's what it was designed to do.  Once you introduce those characters, especially newlines, it breaks xarg's expectations and yours as well
