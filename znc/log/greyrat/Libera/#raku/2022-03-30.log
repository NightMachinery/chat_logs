[00:30:11] <drakonis> by the way, are there any benchmarks for seeing how well raku scales compared to erlang and elixir?
[00:30:27] <drakonis> that's a cool thing
[00:30:34] <drakonis> but i oughta ask, Slangs?
[00:31:01] <drakonis> sublanguages?
[00:32:29] <SmokeMachine> Here is the example using web sockets: https://github.com/FCO/p6-react/blob/master/ws.p6
[00:32:51] <drakonis> that does certainly look a lot like how liveview does components
[00:33:03] <drakonis> which is quite nice.
[00:33:57] <SmokeMachine> drakonis: I think you was asking about rakudo.js the other day, right?
[00:34:05] <drakonis> i did too, yes.
[00:36:07] <drakonis> i'm not sure if it maps to something like clojurescript
[00:36:11] <SmokeMachine> I don’t know if you saw my answer (it was too long after the question), but here is something using it (just a test and takes too long to load): https://fco.github.io/MemoizedDOM/todo6.html
[00:36:28] <SmokeMachine> https://github.com/FCO/MemoizedDOM
[00:36:34] <drakonis> ah, i've seen that already, yes.
[00:38:52] <guifa> drakonis slangs are so much fun but generally still a WIP.  
[00:39:14] <drakonis> doesnt seem to be properly documented at the moment?
[00:40:09] <guifa> yeah, won't be much until the ability to make them gets a lot of polish.  For the most part, you have to use NQP and work with the QAST and that's part of Rakudo, not Raku
[00:40:37] <guifa> RakuAST will get that to a point that it will be officially supported in a stable manner
[00:40:54] <guifa> https://github.com/alabamenhu/BasicTest <-- but here's a module that shows some of what will be possible
[00:41:25] <codesections> Thanks, lizmat++
[00:41:49] <guifa> https://github.com/alabamenhu/BasicTest/blob/main/t/00-sanity.t <-- showing off the code (I should probably add some to the readme, but meh)
[00:45:55] <codesections> drakonis: I am aware of phoenix liveview!  Funny you should mention it, I've actually been giving it a fair bit of thought!  My initial plan *wasn't* for Epee to use that sort of websocket-driven model, but the more I noodle around, the more it seems seems like it could be a good fit
[00:46:36] <codesections> but I haven't had much time to work on Epee lately, so I haven't actually implemented anything along those lines
[00:47:55] <drakonis> oh i see, it has taken the backseat over developing persistent data structures, yeah?
[00:48:53] <drakonis> also, i keep getting your work on them is useful for saving a system image containing all state on disk?
[00:50:24] <drakonis> uh
[00:50:27] <drakonis> keep getting told that your work

[02:40:57] <kawaii_> Hello, I'm using the Red ORM and I've configured one of my columns to be constrained to an Array of Ints like this: `has Array[Int] @.encounter-id is column{ :type<integer[]> };` but I'm not sure if Red/Raku/Postgres have the same idea of what that should look like `Type check failed in assignment to @!encounter-id; expected Positional[Array[Int]] but got Array ([78])`, or is this due to the fact this particular entry it is trying to load only 
[02:40:57] <kawaii_> had a single Int in the "array"?

[02:46:23] <kawaii_> Arrayception 
[02:46:57] <MasterDuke> but when e.g., you have a parameterized array in a signature, you have to pass it an actual parameterized array, not just an array that happens to have all the elements of the correct type
[02:50:48] <MasterDuke> e.g., `sub foo(Int @ints) { ... }; foo([1, 2, 3]);` won't work but `sub foo(Int @int) { ... }; foo(Array[Int].new(1, 2, 3));` or `sub foo(@ints where @ints.are ~~ Int) { ... }; foo([1, 2, 3])` will
[02:51:39] <kawaii_> Ah thank you for the example! It clarifies it for me.

[23:04:38] <Altreus> If I wanted to output all the days of the current month with a field next to each one that I can put a number in, how easy is that and what should I use for the interface part?
[23:04:42] <Altreus> on the terminal that is
[23:07:29] <japhb> Altreus, are you wanting to just display it, or make it interactive?
[23:07:41] <Altreus> interactive
[23:08:00] <Altreus> the next part will be writing out the values so I can pre-fill ones I did in the past :D
[23:08:28] <japhb> Ah.  Then for the terminal side you're limited in the available tooling at the moment (which I try to work on in my spare time, as do a couple other people, but ... $life).
[23:08:46] <japhb> Terminal::Print will let you treat the screen as a printable grid.
[23:09:07] <Altreus> I can happily do it by absolute coordinates tbh
[23:09:45] <Altreus> should be fairly easy to figure out the coordinates of calendar things :)
[23:10:07] <japhb> Yeah, in that case, Terminal::Print is probably a starting point.  I know there was someone who'd done a little work towards navigable tables, which is also in the vicinity of your use case, but I'm not sure how far along that is.
[23:10:41] <Altreus> If that's going then I'm into the idea ... first prototype might just be me typing in the values linewise :)
[23:10:47] <japhb> Yeah, the extra methods that Date has in Raku these days help that a lot.
[23:11:49] <Altreus> might have to install new raku then :P
[23:12:50] * japhb has actually been working on a time-and-date TUI app using Terminal::Print this week, oddly enough ... but it's not a calendar, so not quite what you're going for.
