[00:00:40] <cherim> I keep seeing this as an irrelevant "motivation" in math texts, but never dealt with it directly
[00:01:55] <Gurkenglas> How do I go about modelling a random vector? I could take the variables with largest mutual information, somehow combine them into one, and then repeat for a binary hierarchy... what's the principled approach?
[00:02:12] <cherim> Combinatorial designs, by definition, are collections of subsets (blocks) that satisfy regularity properties like "every t-set lies in the same number of blocks"
[00:02:43] *** Quits: mei (~mei@user/mei) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[00:02:59] <cherim> So they say that if you want to test effects of simultaneous presence of features you can make fewer trials that binom(n, t) if you use blocks of a design for that
[00:03:06] <kobalt> qergle: that would be less than 2 students gets no prize. answer would be 230052?
[00:03:54] <cherim> Keeping decently represented tried subsets. But it's incomparable in practical importance to the internal depth of combinatorics involved

[02:07:01] <newpy> it seems like a isn't constant (1/3, 1/5, 1/7, 1/9, ...) so it can't?
[02:07:54] <dude12312414> it's not exactly a geometric sum, but if you know the right thing, you can massage it into a well-known series expansion

[02:11:56] <dude12312414> also is (2n+1) just some constant?

[04:33:46] <Kaylah> hello, I'm trying to solve an exercise on linear programming for a uni course, but don't understand the answer of the solution key: https://i.imgur.com/o7c92b0.png
[04:34:16] <Kaylah> the black line represents the "objective function", which should be maximized, so 40x_1+50x_2 must be as large as possible
[04:35:23] <Kaylah> the green, red and blue lines represent 3 constraints marking a "feasible area", so the solution must be beneath all 3 those lines; so in the current configuration the highest possible value of the objective function would be in that big red dot
[04:36:40] <Kaylah> now the exercise is to determine how much the right-hand-side value of the first constraint (x_1+2*x_2 <= 40) can increase before not being one of the binding constraints anymore
[04:37:34] <Kaylah> so right now the blue and red lines are the binding constraints, because the optimal solution lies on their intersection; so basically we want to determine how much we can move the blue line up before it is no longer binding
[04:38:39] <Kaylah> the solution key says that it can increase up to 50, so the constraint would become x_1+2*x_2<=50, and I've calculated that this would mean that the blue line intersects the current intersection of the red and green lines
[04:38:58] <Kaylah> like this: https://i.imgur.com/B4qhfww.png
[04:39:46] *** Joins: Fohsap (~Muimi@60.20.216.89)
[04:40:42] <Kaylah> but I would think that it can increase even further, up to 60 (which corresponds to the intersection of the vertical axis and the green line), and still be one of the binding constraints
[04:40:59] <Kaylah> like this: https://i.imgur.com/9Q4mlGr.png
[04:41:55] <Kaylah> only if the rhs value would increase even further beyond 61, it would no longer be a binding constraint, because then the optimal point would just stay in that intersection of the vertical axis and the green line
[04:42:54] <PlanckWalk> It depends upon *exactly* how they define those terms
[04:43:50] *** Joins: acd_ (~acd@136.144.43.115)
[04:44:19] <PlanckWalk> They could equally plausibly mean how much you can change that parameter before the current binding constraints (plural) cease to be binding.

[04:49:16] <Kaylah> indeed, I forgot to mention it but there's also a constraint that all variables must be >=0
[04:49:23] <Kaylah> so the vertical axis is actually also a constraint
[04:49:31] <Inline> by all that group-theoretic background, no one able to formulate the reflection notation (symbolism) with one which consists itself of group theoretic notation ?
[04:49:37] <PlanckWalk> Not in your diagram it isn't.
[04:49:50] <PlanckWalk> You only have 3 constraints listed
[04:50:12] <Kaylah> indeed, it's just implicit
[04:50:35] <Kaylah> it's an assumption made for all these problems so they didn't bother mentioning it in the figure
[04:50:41] <PlanckWalk> Okay
[04:50:49] <Kaylah> but either way you're right! I misinterpreted the meaning of the question
[04:50:55] *** Quits: acd_ (~acd@136.144.43.115) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[04:51:00] <Kaylah> or actually the meaning of the term "range of feasibility"
[04:51:37] <Kaylah> this is actually the range of the rhs value for which the same 2 constraints will be binding (ie the range for which the optimal point is the intersection of the same two lines)
[04:52:13] <Kaylah> but that means that the rhs value can increase even beyond this range of feasibility and the constraint in question would still be binding, just in combination with another constraint then
[04:52:25] <PlanckWalk> Right
[04:52:28] <Kaylah> thank you for pointing me in the right direction mr PlanckWalk!
[04:53:51] <qergle> i agree with 60 being the point not 50. was 50 a typo?

[04:54:56] <Kaylah> well I actually misinterpreted and misquoted the purpose of the exercise
[04:56:01] <qergle> what is the actual question then?
[04:56:01] <Kaylah> the real purpose was to find within which range of the rhs value the same 2 constraints remain binding
[04:56:02] <qergle> what is the actual question then?
[04:56:44] <Kaylah> so in that case it's indeed up to the intersection of the red and green line, which corresponds to 50
[04:57:00] <qergle> oh i see, with RHS 40 on blue, it's blue and red
[04:57:06] <qergle> with RHS 50 on blue, it
[04:57:32] <Kaylah> well on exactly 50 it's actually all 3 of them
[04:57:38] <qergle> with RHS 51 on blue it's blue and green

[04:59:37] <Kaylah> so the 3 constraints intersect in the same point
[05:00:26] <Kaylah> I suppose you could say that none of them is binding then, cause you could take any one of them and the optimal point wouldn't change
[05:00:28] <Kaylah> lol
[05:00:33] <qergle> the issue is whether relaxing green there does anything

[05:00:53] <Kaylah> yeah but you could relax any of them and it wouldn't do anything, right
[05:00:54] <qergle> if relaxing green doesn't increase the objective value then it's not binding
[05:01:12] <Kaylah> you could also relax red at that point, and the objective value wouldn't change
[05:01:20] <qergle> no, both blue and red are binding, relaxing does affect the objective
[05:01:42] <qergle> put blue RHS at 50, you get what, 1400?

[05:02:51] *** Joins: XCode (~Username@d66-222-211-170.abhsia.telus.net)
[05:02:54] <Kaylah> if you completely remove the red line there, the optimal point stays in the same point
[05:02:56] <int-e> cherim: Yes, thinking about infinitesimals is how I rediscovered the idea, but it's kind of doing the opposite... at least in my current intution, z is large here, at least at the moment where we exploit that the char poly of A is monic. Which doesn't connect well with substiting it by 0 in the end.
[05:03:23] <Kaylah> it's simply because it's the intersection of 3 lines: remove any of the lines and the intersection is still in the same point
[05:03:27] <qergle> Kaylah: put blue at 50, then increase green to 31.
[05:03:55] <qergle> still at 1400, right?
[05:04:03] <Kaylah> yeah
[05:04:16] <qergle> so it can't be a binding constraint by definition, no?
[05:04:19] <Kaylah> true
[05:04:27] <Kaylah> but you can do exactly the same for red for instance
[05:04:44] <Kaylah> keep blue at 50 and green at 30, but increase red to 41
[05:04:53] <Kaylah> optimal point will still be at 1400
[05:05:08] <Kaylah> so red can't be binding then
[05:05:29] <Kaylah> or keep green at 30 and red at 40 but increase blue to 51, optimal point is still 1400 so blue can't be binding either

[05:14:23] <qergle> i believe we're right, it's binding if it's at equality at the optimal point,right?
[05:14:50] <Kaylah> hmm what do you mean by 'at equality'?
[05:14:58] <qergle> so let's take blue 50, again. we agree we're at 1400 (x1=10,x2=20)
[05:15:20] <qergle> well, green is x1 + x2 ≤ 30, right?
[05:15:31] <Kaylah> yeah
[05:15:34] <qergle> at x1=10,x2=20 we have 10+20 = 30
[05:16:06] <qergle> and red at x1=10,x2=20 we have 20+20=40
[05:16:36] <qergle> so both are at equality. i think that means they're technically binding? maybe an lp expert can enlighten us
[05:17:25] <Kaylah> yeah I think you can put it like that
[05:17:33] <Kaylah> it depends how you define "binding" indeed
[05:17:51] <qergle> what i think happens is that we end up switching over
[05:17:52] <Kaylah> I guess you could say that blue is definitely binding because relaxing it changes the solution either way
[05:18:11] <Kaylah> and that red and green together form a binding pair or something
[05:18:26] <Kaylah> cause if you relax just one of them, it doesn't change the solution, but if you relax both of them, the solution changes
[05:18:27] <qergle> yeah, and when one moves the other takes over
[05:18:57] <qergle> so thought binding in the equality sense, it's not enough to move the objective because you have redundancy, in a way.
[05:18:57] <Kaylah> indeed

[07:30:50] <Atsuko> when i have the current data
[07:33:08] <Atsuko> 17=23.80% | 15.4=36.93% | 15.5=36.14% | 15.6=35.30%
[07:34:26] <greenbagels> Atsuko: you can try to plot your sample points and make a best fit curve through the data
[07:34:53] <greenbagels> you would need more data to get a better idea though
[07:35:35] <greenbagels> is this x264?
[07:35:55] <Atsuko> it will be different for each video, i was hoping to find a formula to find best crf without needing to do multiple passes
[07:35:56] <Atsuko> yeah
[07:36:44] <greenbagels> i don't know if the quality to bitrate curve would be constant, i imagine its input-dependent

[07:37:46] <greenbagels> sampling this process would be very time consuming, yeah
[07:38:40] <greenbagels> if you're ok with multiple passes, but not *too many*, you could try some kind of bisection method i guess
[07:38:57] <greenbagels> overshoot, undershoot, split the difference, repeat until close enough, idk
[07:39:10] <Atsuko> yeah thats not a bad idea
[07:39:21] <Atsuko> i use a formula atm but it doesn't work

[07:51:32] <greenbagels> Atsuko: the reason finding a single formula would be difficult is that the "difficulty" of compressing the video frames depends on teh video itself

[15:34:14] <joel135> I believe that's a multinomial coefficient.
[15:35:32] <joel135> If you only have two letters then you could solve it, perhaps? That is, in how many ways can "XYYXYYXYXYY" be rearranged? The answer is a binomial coefficient.

[17:32:51] <joel135> this is one way to brute force it https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/6mLIUrXn
[17:32:52] <PlanckWalk> Derangements of sequences with repetition are definitely more complicated than those without repetition.

[17:33:39] <kobalt> rotation
[17:34:06] <PlanckWalk> Once you have a function that returns number of derangements for some given letters fixed in place, you can fairly easily turn that into an algorithm for selecting one uniformly at random.
[17:34:07] <cherim> For just one you still shift. Sort all letters, shift by the largest multiplicity of a letter

[19:34:22] <tmyklebu_> Kaylah: what are the solutions at each of the crossed-out nodes?
[19:35:29] <Kaylah> I'm not sure, but I think that at any node if you set all undetermined ("free") variables equal to 1, then you get those "upper bound" values
[19:36:08] *** Quits: manic_laughter (~manic_lau@157.46.104.33) (Client Quit)
[19:36:09] <Kaylah> so in P1 for instance, if you set x1=0 and all other variables =1, then the function becomes 33

[19:36:58] <tmyklebu_> i see.  but you have constraints to deal with, and presumably you get an infeasible solution by doing that.  so you'll need to switch at least one variable to 0, which carries a cost of at least 3, no?
[19:37:43] <Kaylah> indeed I think that's correct, but I think that's why they only call it a "bound", the bound is determined by ignoring the constraints
[19:38:02] <Kaylah> so it just tells you that the actual solution (taking into account the constraints) can never be higher than that bound
[19:38:19] <Kaylah> here's another example which I don't understand either, if that helps: https://i.imgur.com/ZqBcZjd.png
[19:40:07] <cherim> Second example matches what they say but the 4-28 doesn't
[19:40:57] <tmyklebu_> i'm saying you can tighten the bound by checking if the constraints are satisfied at the unconstrained optimum.  if not, you have to toggle at least one variable, which tightens your bound.  i'm not clear on how they determine infeasibility either.  checking consistency of a set of linear inequalities is equivalent to linear programming.
[19:41:14] <tmyklebu_> and if you're doing LP, why not just compute LP solutions?
[19:42:07] <Kaylah> this is just a specific solution method for LP with only binary variables
[19:42:29] <cherim> You can indeed cross out the nodes on 4-28 by doing exactly one extra level ("toggle out one"), but you need the 32 bound which is ahead in DFS
[19:42:30] <Kaylah> cherim could you tell me how they do it in the second example?
[19:43:13] <cherim> And it's a strange idea to omit that one level for demonstrating the idea
[19:43:44] <cherim> Obviously, they don't do LP because variables are in {0, 1}.
[19:44:27] <cherim> But they don't claim any depth beyond the very basic branch-and-bound, so it's not a big loss not to explai every node on 4-28
[19:44:40] <cherim> Can safely move forward

[20:02:39] <Kaylah> hmm cherim I did some calculations and I can see that for node 5 of Ex. 4 for instance (x1=0, x2=1), you can never satisfy the last constraint as you said
[20:02:47] <Kaylah> so I understand that node 5 is crossed out
[20:03:05] <Kaylah> but then what's the difference with node 4 for instance?
[20:03:17] <Kaylah> because for node 4 you can also never satisfy all 3 constraints
[20:03:38] <Kaylah> either the last one or the third one is not satisfied, so I don't understand why they keep branching from node 4 instead of crossing it out
[20:04:14] <cherim> They don't do this "either or" thing. Only check each constraint separately
[20:04:24] <Kaylah> aah I think I get it, yes
[20:04:29] <Kaylah> was just about to ask that
[20:04:55] <cherim> All more complex arguments are dropped since fixing a new variable will give you more per effort spent
[20:04:57] <Kaylah> so for node 4, there is a certain configuration for which constraint 1 is fulfilled, there's also one for which constraint 2 is fulfilled, and also one for which constraint 3 is fulfilled

[20:09:14] <Kaylah> mr(s) cherim awesome! I used excel to quickly do the calculations and I get the exact same result: https://i.imgur.com/XrjaPLF.png
[20:09:53] <Kaylah> on the right I have 4 tables which contain the values of the variables; in the top table I wrote the values that I impose (ie the fixed ones)
[20:10:27] <Kaylah> then in the second table for instance, I take over those imposed values and fill in the most ideal ones for constraint 1 for the free variables, and then I check constraint 1 right beneath it
[20:10:40] <Kaylah> in the third table I do the same for constraint 2, and fourth table for constraint 3
[20:11:22] <Kaylah> so if any of those 3 checks is "NOK", it means that even in the most preferable situation from the constraint's point of view, the constraint is not fulfilled, and hence it can be scratched out
[20:11:38] <Kaylah> and the columns with a "NOK" are exactly the ones corresponding to the nodes that are crossed out :)
[20:13:04] <Kaylah> thank you very much for your help mr(s) cherim and mr(s) tmyklebu_

[23:26:42] <[itchyjunk]> you mean ##math-offtopic ?

[23:26:45] <APic> No
[23:26:47] <APic> #not-math
[23:26:49] <APic> ;=P
[23:26:56] <APic> But yes, i could join the other one again too
[23:26:58] <APic> Thanks for the Hint
[23:26:59] <[itchyjunk]> aren't most channels on this server not math?
[23:27:07] * APic ragequitted there recently
[23:27:10] <APic> Yes
[23:27:23] <int-e> We've got to be careful with the "halting problem" term though. Formally it's about distinguishing between acceptance and non-acceptance; termination is just a condition that allows us to tell the difference in most models of computation.
[23:27:48] <APic> Ok, i am _also_ again in ##math-offtopic
[23:27:57] <APic> Just got a Bit displaced in my Irssis 😸

[23:30:14] <newpy> if I'm given part of a Hessian matrix and asked to fill in the blanks, should I reconstruct the original function from the given second partial derivatives?

[23:33:30] <newpy> I think I should take a double integral, but I'm not sure how to integrate the constant y term int{c(y)dx}
[23:33:37] <newpy> just c(y)x?

[23:35:10] <APic> Maybe WolframAlpha can answer. If not, patch it. 😉
[23:36:42] <newpy> yes I'm just going to give it a go

[23:36:49] *** Parts: savask (~savask@Powder/Developer/savask) ()
[23:38:20] <newpy> also I only did it with first partials so it was easier to integrate one partial, then derivate and set equal to the other given partial
