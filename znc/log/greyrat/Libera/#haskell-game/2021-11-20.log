[00:49:50] <EvanR> so terminology
[00:49:56] <EvanR> sprites
[00:50:12] <EvanR> they are little graphics that move all over your screen
[00:50:28] <EvanR> occasionally you encounter a "big sprite" but anyway
[00:50:47] <EvanR> what are the individual entries in a sprite sheet called
[00:50:56] <EvanR> i.e. the source material that makes sprites work
[00:51:33] <f-a> to be honest I have always called them «sprites»
[00:51:33] <sm> if you're animating ?
[00:51:50] <EvanR> I know you'd probably also call those sprites
[00:51:56] <f-a> and stuff on screen «entities», «things» or whatever
[00:52:11] <f-a> «character», etc.
[00:52:13] <EvanR> not necessarily animated
[00:52:13] <sm> frame, cell or cel I think
[00:52:19] <EvanR> ah ok
[00:52:27] <f-a> frame is good
[00:52:46] <EvanR> not to be confused with FPS frames
[00:53:06] <sm> if it's just a static image.. image, sprite, sprite image - no big distinction needed ?
[00:53:07] <f-a> and not to be confused with framing an innocent person
[00:53:36] <sm> or framing the debate
[00:54:39] <sm> I suppose you do need a distinction or you wouldn't be asking...different types eh
[00:54:53] <EvanR> if they apparently don't move, like are part of a level, I'd called them tiles
[00:55:05] <EvanR> if they would be moving, I'd call them sprites
[00:55:21] <sm> oh, another line of distinction
[00:55:43] <EvanR> sprite sheet, tile sheet xD
[00:56:03] <EvanR> it's like, the sheet seems to have no distinction
[00:56:20] <sm> right, both of them are an image sheet
[00:56:48] <EvanR> btw what's a sprite atlas
[00:57:06] <EvanR> or that basically the same thing
[00:57:27] <f-a> a collection of spritesheets
[00:57:45] <EvanR> oh
[00:57:57] <f-a> think about it as forth pages, one block might have all the animations of PlayerCharacter (jump, run, etc.)
[00:58:06] <f-a> second block baddies etc.
[00:58:18] <EvanR> forth pages xD
[00:58:30] <EvanR> brb going to school for that
[01:04:21] <sm> I haven't heard that before
[01:04:55] <sm> I think f-a is tricking us
[01:05:10] * f-a sweats
[01:05:10] <ManofLetters[m]> you made it up f-a to mock us
[01:05:26] <sm> trying to nerd snipe us with Forth..
[01:05:58] <f-a> http://turboforth.net/tutorials/blocks.html
[01:06:03] <sm> no!
[01:06:15] <f-a> only God knows how they managed to factor their programs squarely into blocks
[01:06:41] <f-a> but that is the beauty of Forth, miminalistic models
[01:06:42] <ManofLetters[m]> perfectly round^H^H^Hsquare programs
[01:06:58] * sm looked but managed to escape
[01:13:25] *** Joins: __monty__ (~toonn@user/toonn)
[01:35:22] <EvanR> the part where you can load a block, change it, flag as dirty, and it is committed back to disk is cool
[02:43:26] <EvanR> dang I'm sort of stumped 
[02:43:50] <EvanR> I loaded an rgba png file with juicy pixels, as a texture, and it works fine
[02:44:34] <EvanR> but this rgb file looks like this for some reason, rendered with the same code.. https://i.imgur.com/GdnKdPF.png
[02:45:06] <sm> sweet, ship it
[02:45:18] <EvanR> italics, feature not a bug
[02:47:53] <sm> perhaps a bug report at https://github.com/Twinside/Juicy.Pixels/issues is the way
[02:48:36] <EvanR> I looked at the results of loading the image with juicy with a microscope
[02:48:42] <EvanR> looks correct
[02:48:42] <sm> bug reports for image libraries are fun, they include pictures and making the problem obvious
[02:49:21] <EvanR> problem between loading into GL and displaying it
[02:50:04] <sm> yikes
[02:50:09] <sm> above my pay grade!
[02:51:10] <EvanR> https://i.imgur.com/NMgACrk.png
[02:51:21] <EvanR> zoomed 8 times... wth xD
[02:51:38] <EvanR> (it's not supposed to be tutti fruity colored)
[02:52:24] <EvanR> it's like each line starts 1 byte early
[02:53:06] <EvanR> maybe it's because this image file has an odd number of columns
[02:56:47] <EvanR> it fixed
[02:56:55] <EvanR> cropped to even number of columns lol
[02:57:29] <EvanR> the implementation must be like... wtf and just round width down to even
[02:57:48] <EvanR> (in the old days you were told to always have power of 2 size textures)
[02:57:57] <EvanR> (square! both ways!)
[03:02:52] <EvanR> :rubberduck:
[03:07:36] <sm> EvanR, I think you've had a few too many
[03:10:05] <EvanR> I haven't even started drinking yet
[03:10:18] <EvanR> :tm"
[03:10:21] <EvanR> :

[03:57:25] <EvanR> scratch that, when I cropped with mac preview, it added an alpha channel 
[03:58:47] <ManofLetters[m]> it a little bit looks subpixel font redering
[03:58:58] <ManofLetters[m]> *lie
[03:59:01] <ManofLetters[m]> *like
[03:59:12] <ManofLetters[m]> doh, I didn't drink anything either ;)
[04:00:54] <EvanR> yeah, which makes no sense at that scale
[04:01:37] <ManofLetters[m]> that's what I was getting when taking a screenshot of subpixel rendered glyphs and zooming in
[04:02:34] <ManofLetters[m]> (which is one more reason why fonts shouldn't be zoomed in with non-font libs)
[04:14:28] <EvanR> ok after slicing off 1 column properly and testing it shows that odd image width is what causes the "lost byte per line" effect
[04:14:43] <EvanR> even width and RGB format works fine

[21:20:53] <f-a> sm: I forgot, is there a good reason why ghcid does *not* work with `displaySize` (or vice versa)?
[21:21:20] <sm> g'day f-a, all
[21:21:30] <sm> eh.. I forget
[21:22:06] <sm> IIRC, the terminal context provided by ghcid does not allow it
[21:22:09] <f-a> I am doing some kind of half baked hot reload with `entr` and feels cosy
[21:22:15] <sm> non-interactive ? or something
[21:22:31] <sm> entr is great
[21:39:10] <f-a> not sure you people enjoy chess, but antichess (alias “Kamikaze chess”) is really fun

[22:33:31] <EvanR> cool
[22:33:59] <f-a> ohh that is very handy
[22:34:26] <f-a> I use byzanz record but it is a pain to get the frame right
[22:40:58] <EvanR> lichess.org is pretty spiffy
[22:41:13] <f-a> very good both for the OS world and for chess world

[22:43:16] <sm> a fantastic resource
[22:44:18] <sm> I wonder how you could overlay captions on an ascii cast
[22:45:22] * f-a tries it

[22:53:50] <EvanR> if you linefeed it just moves the window down
