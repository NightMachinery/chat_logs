[01:30:55] <jtgd> problems now. seemed ok last night I went to bed 5am. up at 14:30 (PDT) and all the channels said "Disconnected, Reconnecting" about 6 times and then nothing. The end of  lines in all channels was 8:25. The znc was running and web interface ok. I restart and it plays back some history, but only like a couple hours, not the whole 6 hours missing
[01:32:06] <jtgd> One, I'd like to know why that happens and what I can so. Two, where does it keep the logs? I don't see them under ~/.znc
[01:32:24] <jtgd> s/can so/can do
[01:32:24] <ZNC-Linker> jtgd meant: “One, I'd like to know why that happens and what I can do. Two, where does it keep the logs? I don't see them under ~/.znc”
[01:32:42] <Khaytsus> jtgd: You sure your znc is on a stable connection?  Not offline?  Not a machine that goes to sleep or some silliness?
[01:32:56] <jtgd> no sleep

[01:33:22] <jtgd> before znc I would leave connections up all night and nothing lost

[01:34:38] <jtgd> is there a log kept?

[01:37:47] <MetaNova> jtgd: have [[Adminlog]] loaded, the resulting file should be ~/.znc/moddata/adminlog/znc.log
[01:37:47] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/Adminlog
[01:38:44] <jtgd> how do I load it?
[01:38:55] <MetaNova> /msg *status loadmod adminlog
[01:39:09] <MetaNova> (while connected to ZNC)
[01:40:08] <MetaNova> jtgd: also, be sure you have [[Chansaver]] loaded as well: /msg *status loadmod --type=global chansaver
[01:40:08] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/Chansaver
[01:41:10] <keir> Lartza: make that two people happy ;)
[01:41:48] <jtgd> ok. loaded both. So I guess this is not expected behavior? :) I have to wait for it to happen again to analyze?
[01:43:17] <jtgd> is there something that limits the size of the channel logs? and where are the logs?
[01:43:57] <MetaNova> jtgd: no, this is not expected behavior, ZNC should continually try to connect and rejoin the channels you were previously joined to
[01:44:57] <MetaNova> jtgd: the "logs" from ZNC are either the user/channel/query logs from [[Log]], the admin logs from [[Adminlog]], or you can run ZNC in debug mode ("znc -D") and either observe the output from stdout or redirect it to a file
[01:44:57] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/Log https://wiki.znc.in/Adminlog
[01:44:58] <jtgd> all chnnels ahd the exact same pattern of "Disconnected...\nReconnecting..." 5 times and then nothing
[01:45:23] <MetaNova> that shouldn't be blasted to every channel
[01:45:34] <MetaNova> the "Disconnected...\nReconnecting..." messages I mean
[01:45:37] <Khaytsus> Certainly not, only 'server status' channels
[01:45:42] <Khaytsus> bufers
[01:45:54] <MetaNova> server status/network status tab/context/buffer, yes
[01:45:55] <jtgd> what is [[Log]] ?
[01:45:55] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/Log
[01:46:15] <MetaNova> it can log channel conversations and queries/private messages, for later reference
[01:46:22] <MetaNova> it does not log disconnects/reconnects/errors
[01:46:30] <MetaNova> (that's what Adminlog is for)
[01:48:36] <jtgd> ok so I thought it was already logging for me. I did the loadmod log now. And yet it was able to replay the last hour or so when I reconnected.
[01:49:24] <MetaNova> <MetaNova> also be sure to reference https://wiki.znc.in/FAQ#What_are_the_different_module_load_levels.3F_.28Global_vs_User_vs_Network.29
[01:49:24] <MetaNova> <MetaNova> (I talk about the *log module there)
[01:49:53] <MetaNova> just to be clear, the logs generated from *log are physical files stored on the ZNC host
[01:50:08] <jtgd> does clicking the box in the web interface also load modules?
[01:50:11] <MetaNova> these are only channel and query logs, no ZNC status/admin logs
[01:50:19] <MetaNova> jtgd: you can load modules via webadmin, yes

[01:55:23] <jtgd> ok I see the logs now, which is sort of the point of running znc for me :). How do I skip the quits and joins?
[01:56:35] <MetaNova> to have the log module not log quits/parts/joins, see https://wiki.znc.in/Log#Commands
[01:56:41] <MetaNova> eg, /msg *log help
[01:56:52] <MetaNova> you'd want: /qf log
[01:57:18] <MetaNova> er
[01:57:33] <MetaNova> you'd want: /msg *log set quits false ; /msg *log set joins false
[01:59:52] <jtgd> oic so log makes like a pseudo channel to talk to, like *status?
[02:00:09] *** Quits: grys (~quassel@botters/gry) (Quit: .)
[02:00:55] <jtgd> ok, very nice
[02:01:18] *** Joins: grys (~quassel@botters/gry)
[02:01:42] <jtgd> the wiki mentions set quits false but doesn't explain all the commands
[02:02:30] <MetaNova> it is (supposed to be) general knowledge that you can '/msg *modulename help' for command output
[02:02:34] <jtgd> ok I guess the Help explains that
[02:02:42] <jtgd> got it
[02:02:55] <MetaNova> as such, this is recommended default behavior for any new module you are loading/configuring/learning
[02:03:12] <MetaNova> (get into the habit of /msg *module help)
[02:03:43] <jtgd> so every module creates a *channel and then you interact with that?
[02:04:08] <MetaNova> your client handles them as private messages/queries, like any other nick
[02:04:40] <jtgd> right, and there's one for each module loaded
[02:04:57] <MetaNova> but yes, you can create a separate tab/context with '/query *modulename' and then just do 'help' in the new tab
[02:05:01] <MetaNova> yes
[02:05:08] <MetaNova> with *status being the core
[02:05:28] <MetaNova> that's why the litmus test for, "is the user connected to ZNC?" is '/msg *status help'
[02:05:51] <MetaNova> because if you can't speak with *status, you're not connected to ZNC (unless in the rare situation you put *status on ignore, that happened once)
[02:06:05] <MetaNova> you should also reference *controlpanel [[Controlpanel]]
[02:06:05] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/Controlpanel
[02:06:18] <MetaNova> as it can do *almost* as many things as webadmin can
[02:06:45] <jtgd> yeah I wasn't sure what state I was in so I just exited the client and restarted
[02:08:23] <jtgd> wow this is pretty deep. looks like a lot of work guys
[02:09:06] <MetaNova> you are able to configure/manage/administer ZNC entirely through your client in most situations
[02:09:06] <jtgd> cool. well I'll let you know if this thing misbehaves again and look at the admin log
[02:09:11] <MetaNova> okay
[02:10:13] <jtgd> that's good. I may hang with the comfort of the web interface for a bit. hopefully this will settle down soon and just run.\
[02:11:18] <MetaNova> jtgd: just a reminder, global modules (*status loadmod --type=global) like *adminlog store files in ~/.znc/moddata/adminlog/, user modules (*status loadmod --type=user) are ~/.znc/users/<username>/moddata/, network (*status loadmod --type=network) modules are in ~/.znc/users/<username>/networks/<network>/moddata/
[02:11:52] <MetaNova> jtgd: which level did you load *log at?
[02:15:52] <jtgd> not sure. I thought I just typed the command you sent
[02:17:19] <jtgd> the web shows log is checked for both global setting and Your settings
[02:17:51] <jtgd> there won't be any other users than me
[02:19:51] <MetaNova> well
[02:19:59] <jtgd> I'm curious how, before I loaded the log module, it was able to replay the channel logs after I restarted. (only for like 45 mins though)
[02:20:06] <MetaNova> that brings me to my point in linking https://wiki.znc.in/FAQ#What_are_the_different_module_load_levels.3F_.28Global_vs_User_vs_Network.29
[02:20:39] <MetaNova> if you have Log loaded both globally and for a User (Your Settings), you're going to be wasting disk space because you're saving duplicate logs
[02:21:32] <jtgd> yes I see. I would just opt for global then
[02:22:04] <MetaNova> yes, since global will log all channels and all queries for all users on all networks anyway
[02:23:51] <jtgd> I query *log and look at help, I don't see where it tells me what level it is at
[02:24:44] <MetaNova> jtgd: that is determined with '/msg *status listmods' as it will group them by load level
[02:25:06] <jtgd> oh, should I not have boxes checked on webint for both?
[02:25:09] <MetaNova> ^ easy way to check if you have a module loaded needlessly
[02:25:15] <MetaNova> jtgd: no
[02:25:32] <MetaNova> as a single user, you can load it globally or for your user and the result is the same
[02:25:46] <MetaNova> but loading it at both is going to take 2x as much disk space
[02:25:56] <MetaNova> because the contents of the logs are duplicate
[02:26:46] <jtgd> right I just want it to log even if I join different networks
[02:27:01] <MetaNova> then have it loaded either globally, or for your user, not both
[02:27:47] <jtgd> listmods looks good
[02:31:03] <MetaNova> jtgd: also see '/msg *status listavailmods'
[02:31:25] <MetaNova> to see a more complete list of what modules exist in each level, and if they are loaded/unloaded presently

[07:32:50] <jtgd> sorry I'm still a little confused. Libera is fine so I added another server for bitlbee. I added it through the web page. I don't know what I have to do to make it connect
[07:34:57] <jtgd> "Current Server" says "-N/A-" but I don't see a place to even enter the server, which is localhost
[07:37:06] <jtgd> ok I found where to enter (under a major section that is not bold)
[07:38:06] <jtgd> still not sure how to start it
[07:40:57] <MetaNova> jtgd: when you click on Your Settings -> Edit Network, check the "Connect to IRC & automatically re-connect" box, scroll down to the bottom of the page and click Save and Return
[07:41:33] <jtgd> yes, that is checked
[07:41:56] <MetaNova> then, create a separate connectiong to ZNC in your IRC client, sending either a Username as zncuser/bitlbee and the Password your zncpass, or a Server Password as zncuser/bitlbee:zncpass
[07:42:52] <MetaNova> the /networkname portion of your user or password is how ZNC knows which network for a given user your connection is attaching to
[07:43:02] <MetaNova> and each network for a user requires a separate connection
[07:43:31] <jtgd> where I replace "zncuser" with what is in Your settings/Authentication/Username?
[07:43:37] <MetaNova> yes
[07:44:01] <MetaNova> and zncpass is the password for that ZNC user
[07:44:20] <MetaNova> and I assumed you named the network "bitlbee" in that example
[07:44:21] <jtgd> I don't use a password for that
[07:44:28] <MetaNova> if it's actually Bitlbee then adjust as needed
[07:44:49] <MetaNova> jtgd: cert_auth?
[07:44:56] <MetaNova> s/_//
[07:44:56] <ZNC-Linker> MetaNova meant: “jtgd: certauth?”
[07:45:27] <jtgd> I don't know what that means.
[07:45:46] <jtgd> I am one guy on one computer. I don't need to protect against other users
[07:46:06] <MetaNova> you still need to log in with valid credentials
[07:46:21] <MetaNova> one way to not need to transmit a password is with [[Certauth]]
[07:46:21] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/Certauth
[07:46:25] <jtgd> so password is mandatory?
[07:46:49] <jtgd> ok I'll use a password. sounds easier
[07:47:14] <MetaNova> since you said you don't use a password, I was wondering if you used certauth instead, with AuthOnlyViaModule enabled (disabling password auth)
[07:47:44] <MetaNova> I mean, how were you able to create a user without an associated password>
[07:47:47] <MetaNova> ?
[07:48:23] <jtgd> like I said I don't know what certauth means
[07:48:45] <MetaNova> it's not relevant at the moment, don't worry about it
[07:49:11] <jtgd> it sounds like something someone with very strict security requirements would use, but that's not my use case.
[07:49:21] <MetaNova> anyway, when you connect your client to ZNC on the bitlbee network, you should be able to see via *status what's going on with the connection
[07:53:53] <jtgd> it seems it connected but no messages in *status
[07:54:28] <MetaNova> send /msg *status connect

[08:25:16] <jtgd> Do you remember that problem I came here for earlier today? It happened again. "Disconnected... Reconnecting..." 5 times and then nothing. *status did not respond. I closed all the circe buffers and tried to reconnect but it did not. I exited emacs and tried again and then it seemed to reconnect. It seemed to have stuff in the log during my absense,

[08:41:35] <jtgd> I think the 21:36 is around where it disconnects and 21:47 is where I reconnected (after restarting emacs)
[08:46:40] <jtgd> I don't see much there in the way of clues. is there a more detailed logging level?
[08:57:26] <MetaNova> run ZNC in debug mode, $ znc -D
[09:00:21] <jtgd> ok. will that increase the logging, or should I capture stdout?
[09:00:44] <MetaNova> you'll need to capture stdout
[09:01:09] <MetaNova> either in a pager/terminal multiplexer like screen/tmux, or redirected to a file
[09:01:45] <jtgd> ok
[09:02:38] <jtgd> when I restart znc will it immediately/automatically reconnect to the irc servers and start logging?
[09:04:35] <MetaNova> if you kill ZNC and launch it in debug mode, znc -D, it will immediately try to reconnect to whatever networks were not set Disconnected, dumping everything to stdout
[09:04:56] <MetaNova> this is when you'll want to try connecting to ZNC in your client, to observe why the connection is failing/being rejected

[14:13:57] <jm18> Finnix: i think you can do this by creating 3 znc accounts, connect 1 to irc and connect the other 2 to the first znc instance as here https://wiki.znc.in/Multiple_clients#Older_way
[14:15:23] <Khaytsus> but why
[14:15:29] <Finnix> yes, i already found that, but i cannot make proper config to connect other znc instance with password
[14:16:36] <jm18> what is the problem you are having there?
[14:16:51] <jm18> also what Khaytsus  said... it does sound like an awful idea
[14:17:04] <jm18> what do you actually want to accomplish?
[14:20:15] <mousssacre> I'd assume that you trust these two people to share a single account, but somehow don't trust them enough to let them see connection details?

[14:38:46] <Khaytsus> Still not sure why you need to chain znc accounts, the actual irc account could just be shared by multiple users on the same znc account
[14:39:22] <Khaytsus> But either way it should just work I suppose
[14:40:10] <Finnix> good, but you need to share one password between 2+ people, main idea - use separate passwords for each
[14:40:34] *** Quits: AquaL1te (~AquaL1te@user/aqual1te) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[14:41:02] <Finnix> also if someone publish password somewhere - only one way - change password for znc for all others

[14:42:54] <Khaytsus> But you're not exposing the real irc account..  anywho.  this seems silly, you trust the person or not
[14:43:54] <Finnix> from irc server side it's ok to have only one account, not multiple
[14:45:19] <Finnix> and the trust doesn't matter, the goal - quick and stable solution to block published account without hurt others
[14:50:06] <Khaytsus> You could also have multiple individual znc users all pointed at the same actual irc account...  
[14:50:21] <Khaytsus> No nevermind
[14:51:09] <Khaytsus> Anywho..  just..  seems silly.  but it should just work.  Set up your 'proxy' user, get them working..  ie.. irc client talking to proxyznc talking to irc..  
[14:51:37] <Khaytsus> Then add your second layer of znc server/user talking to your proxy znc.
[14:53:10] <Finnix> good, but i must to get proxy working every time when znc on first layer just restarted
[14:53:12] <mousssacre> yup and disable web conf / user conf so they can't change things if needed, but also - this does seem a little silly
[14:55:10] <Finnix> also CyberShadow's version of clientbuffer can solve my issue?
[14:55:39] <Finnix> it's ok, when clients have proxy@ part, as i see

I tried to connect directly (without znc) to irc and then cbc mode is working. Operating System is Debian Buster. Thanks
[15:05:31] <Khaytsus> Finnix: znc should automatically reconnect and do the things you set it to do, making it run is just whatever..  unit file, script, cron, whatever.
[15:06:54] <Finnix> thanks, Khaytsus, https://github.com/CyberShadow/znc-clientbuffer/blob/master/clientbuffer.cpp - this one solve my issue?

[15:09:33] <rud1> and on wiki page i couldn´t find anything that cbc isn´t supported
[15:10:15] <Khaytsus> Are you saying that znc is somehow breaking this plugin that mirc is running?
[15:10:34] <Finnix> Khaytsus, quick and stable solution to block one client
[15:11:15] <Khaytsus> Finnix: I'm not sure what client buffer would have to do with "blocking" something
[15:12:16] <rud1> 12«14Khaytsus12» it is very strange. only without znc mirc works fine with fish and cbc mode. to isolate i´ve tested this on multiple servers and from connection at home (without znc). only the last worked
