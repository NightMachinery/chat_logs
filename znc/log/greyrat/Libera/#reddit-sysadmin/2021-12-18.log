[00:52:47] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: Unlike other insects that have two pairs of wings, house fly has only one pair of membranous wings. Second pair of wings is reduced and looks like a pair of miniature drumsticks. This pair of wings (known as halters) is used for balancing during the flying process.

[07:45:35] <catbeard> man, been prarie dogging for the last 2 hours, back shortly
[07:45:43] <cryptic1> misspwn, no you are right but thats not the main proble
[07:45:52] <misspwn> lmao good chat catbeard 
[07:45:52] <cryptic1> their course are extremely light on content
[07:45:58] <cryptic1> extreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeemely light
[07:46:21] <cryptic1> as in you need to read all the aws documentation because their content is shit in order to pass an exam
[07:46:37] <misspwn> don't have much to compare it to. it was an early xmas gift so that i could learn more and have all the other stuff with it
[07:46:46] <cryptic1> even their test exam quizes ask questions that are not included in the content from their course...
[07:47:12] <misspwn> if i wanted like actual certification then i'd for sure look other avenues if that is lacking
[07:47:22] <cryptic1> their labs that you can spin up are slick
[07:47:45] <cryptic1> misspwn, oh for sure 
[07:48:48] <misspwn> trying to do all that on my own was so incredibly overwhelming that it made me think maybe i do have ADD. pretty sure not but reading stuff is a little different than watching stuff and doing. i can fix things by doing some googlefu
[07:49:02] <misspwn> want to know the stuff ground up other than break fix
[07:49:10] <cryptic1> I have a hard time focusing on that for any length of time too
[07:49:27] <cryptic1> yeah thats a good way to look at it

[08:04:42] <misspwn> not sure if phone screenings count as the first interview or not, because often times you don't even make it that far
[08:05:00] <misspwn> if it does, this is my 2nd
[08:07:10] <cryptic1> They do count
[08:07:16] <cryptic1> Typically HR screening
[08:07:40] <cryptic1> They would not bother calling if a manager was not interested
[08:08:05] <misspwn> had the screening on the phone with the company recruiter. then they went back and fourth because a different team had more interest in my backup and dr experience
[08:08:23] <misspwn> and i said "i'll go wherever the wind takes me" lmao
[08:08:51] <cryptic1> nice
[08:08:54] <misspwn> the other one though is for a jr sys admin assisting a company migrat to AWS i know nothing about AWS

[20:37:20] <cryptic1> I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you’re referring to as Linux, is in fact, Log4j, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, Log Forge. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning Log Forge system made useful by the Log Forge corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.
[20:37:20] <cryptic1> Many computer users run a modified version of the Log Forge system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of Log Forge which is widely used today is often called “Linux”, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the Log Forge system, developed by the Log4j Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use.
[20:37:21] <cryptic1> Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine’s resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the Log Forge operating system: the whole system is basically Log Forge with Linux added, or Log Forge/Linux. All the so-calle
[20:37:26] <cryptic1> d “Linux” distributions are really distributions of Log Forge/Linux
