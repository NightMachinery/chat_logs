[00:54:37] <ecdhe> jaybe, out of curiosity, do you ever actually bill for $1700/hr?
[00:57:35] <jaybe> one can bill whatever one wants
[00:57:51] <jaybe> if someone wants and needs help for services that cost that much, they pay it
[00:58:57] <ecdhe> do you ever collect?  In my moonlighting I've gotten close to $200/hr, $1700 seems possible but I'd have to be working on different problems
[01:26:30] <ecdhe> I have an embedded background (PCB, FPGA, uC firmware), implemented protocols from RFCs, shipped embedded linux, shipped companion desktop guis (.NET) and server daemons.  I love PKI and ipv6.

[02:04:14] <ecdhe> lunaphyte: you think an imap-interposer is the wrong way to go about achieving a delivery whitelist?  What I liked about it was it avoided having to retrieve all your mail to an intermediate host just to have it filtered.
[02:04:53] <lunaphyte> do you keep scrollback history?  i don't, but we had the discussion
[02:05:06] <ecdhe> lunaphyte: yes, I do
[02:05:26] <ecdhe> I don't know if I'd seen your response to that exact question.
[02:06:37] <ecdhe> My initial questioning came from the idea of fully retrieving mail in an imap client, storing it in a maildir, filtering it, then re-serving that maildir with another IMAP server
[02:06:43] <ecdhe> That was a few days ago.
[02:07:01] <lunaphyte> it was as we were originally discussing the conceptual goal.  towards the tail end of the conversation, as i recall
[02:12:51] <ecdhe> 15:51 <@lunaphyte> anyway, i'm not aware of any imap clients which can selectively retrieve message based on sender
[02:12:54] <ecdhe> 15:58 <@lunaphyte> a program would need to first perform an imap search command, and then given the returned message ids, retrieve those messages
[02:13:26] <lunaphyte> much later i think
[02:14:52] <ecdhe> lunaphyte: Looking at some pcaps I already have, I can see that the mail clients I already know about do a search already (a fetch, anyway) and typically fetch the from: field along with the subject (all the information that would be displayed in a list of messages.)  The FETCH response is one that I could filter without having to pre-retrieve or perform an expensive search.
[02:15:56] <ecdhe> If most clients in the wild already work that way, my interpost could pass those commands transparently and never have to cache all your email (which would make my server a target for people who are after your mail.)
[02:18:23] <ecdhe> lunaphyte: looking at the transcript, all I have is my anecdote about the coworker who's widowed mom got catfished by a spammer, and you replying about parental controls being a good thing if the guardian is willing to take on a maintenance burden of maintaining the "quarantine by default" policy
[02:21:35] <ecdhe> ...anyway, if I can see the default behavior of a few clients, I can ascertain whether or not filtering "FETCH" responses is enough to support my target clients.

[02:27:46] <lunaphyte> hmm, maybe i only thought it, and didn't write it.  it would have been right around that point in the conversation, i would think
[02:28:41] <lunaphyte> the sentiment was that i liked the goal, but imo, in short, the right way to implement it is with a content filter, not a retrieval proxy
[02:32:52] <ecdhe> lunaphyte: your approach is the easiest way to guarantee protocol correctness.
[02:36:29] <ecdhe> On the other hand, syncing moves and deletes between the filtered mbox and the upstream mbox seems like it would require oodles of corner-case handling
[02:54:31] <lunaphyte> there would be no filtered mbox or upstream mbox

[18:08:52] <zap> Hello everyone!  I am having a problem with sending an email with smtpt.  When I get to RCPT TO:<mail@adress.org> command I'm getting 503 5.5.0 
[18:09:09] <zap> "Client host rejected: Improper use of SMTP command pipelining" error has anyone has a clue what that can be? 
[18:09:29] <zap> I'm pretty sure I got all the commands in the right order
[18:09:32] <lunaphyte> zap: have you read about what smtp command pipelining is?
[18:11:11] <zap> nope :)
[18:11:16] <lunaphyte> why not?
[18:13:06] *** Joins: randall (~randall@user/randall)
[18:17:58] <zap> I'm working with email for the first time and kinda get lost in all new terminology.  I thought if I dump right commands in the right order it should work.  Checking what's about now
[18:18:23] *** Joins: minimal (~minimal@user/minimal)
[18:43:31] <zap> Okay. Now when I know what pipelining is I don't get whats going on anyways.  I just put sleep(1) after each line in a for-loop to check and email went through -- Good! But the server Im talking to is advertizing pipelining so as I understand I don't need to wait for responce and so It suppose to work

[19:27:03] <zap> lunaphyte: Not sure It will make things clearer -- it's in Scheme, but code easy to follow I just create socket wrap it with tls port and dump data into it -- https://paste.debian.net/1227516/
[19:29:11] <lunaphyte> zap: i would use gnutls-cli or s_client and test interactively, first.  once that is working, go back to your program
[19:29:56] <zap> oops wrong link -- https://paste.debian.net/1227521/
[19:30:26] <zap> I did actually.  When I do it interactively everything works fine
[19:31:22] <zap> but when I do gnutls-cli mail.mail.net -p 465 <<EOF <SMTP COMMANDA> EOF I get same error
[19:32:08] <lunaphyte> zap: is there a proper smtp library for whatever language this is?  if so, i would suggest using that
[19:32:34] <bremner> you can also use swaks to sanity check the server
[19:34:00] <zap> lunaphyte: I only have bindings to mailutils but they have their own problems :) so I decided to do it manualy
[19:34:19] <zap> bremner: what is swaks? Is it a cli tool?
[19:34:35] <zap> bremner: found it
[19:34:40] <lunaphyte> zap: if you are sending all commands at once, that's not going to work
[19:34:47] <lunaphyte> regardless of pipelining
[19:35:56] <lunaphyte> zap: here's a hint:  when you do the smtp session interactively, when does the remote server offer pipelining?
[19:36:45] <zap> after EHLO
[19:36:51] <lunaphyte> indeed ;)
[19:37:09] <lunaphyte> you cannot use pipelining before the server offers/advertises it
[19:37:16] <zap> Ahh
[19:37:31] <zap> niice
[19:37:38] <zap> ill try that now
[19:43:28] <zap> boom! worked.  lunaphyte thank you for helping out! And bremner for swaks ill probably need it at some point
[19:43:42] <lunaphyte> sure thing, you're welcome
