[00:16:15] <Khepra> since jessie, there has been at least one remotely exploitable tcp stack vuln, so running "just" sshd, wouldn't matter. I don't know if that ever got backported to jessie kernel. still.... why would you.

[00:28:47] <sney> for buster support you would need to use the 5.10 kernel from buster-backports. and for tails support you should be in #tails on OFTC (note, right now you are on libera)

[01:17:05] <neilthereildeil> how do i specify the command to run for screen?

[02:21:47] <Khepra> !firmware images
[02:21:47] <dpkg> There are <live> system and <netinst> and DVD images containing non-free Debian <firmware> packages available from https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/unofficial/non-free/cd-including-firmware/current/amd64/iso-cd/ The images are "unofficial" because "official Debian" includes only 100% free software, but otherwise identical to the normal installer images and prepared by the same Debian Developers.

[02:24:45] <dpkg> [Basic Apt* Troubleshooting]. To diagnose your problem, we need ALL OF THE FOLLOWING information: 1. complete output of your apt-get/apt/aptitude run (including the command used) 2. output from "apt-cache policy pkg1 pkg2..." for ALL packages mentioned ANYWHERE in the problem, and 3. "apt-cache policy".  Use https://paste.debian.net/ to provide us with this information.  Also ask me about <localized errors>.
[02:24:55] <JoeBk> is this what I want? firmware-11.2.0-amd64-netinst.iso
[02:25:15] <karlpinc> JoeBk: Yes.  (Assuming you're running on "standard PC hardware".)
[02:25:30] <JoeBk> ok thanks
[02:26:15] <karlpinc> JoeBk: If your hardware is "new".  You can still have issues.  We'll deal with those if it comes up.
[02:26:32] <JoeBk> does that one include wifi?
[02:26:52] <karlpinc> JoeBk: It includes all non-free firmware.  The installer will ask to setup your wifi.
[02:26:54] <Khepra> they all include wifi. this one includes firmware which might be needed for the wifi.

[08:26:41] <karlpinc> sufodnfaptinstal: You can see the drives, what their name is in /dev/, in the system logs.  /var/log/syslog for instance.
[08:26:43] <sufodnfaptinstal> how do i use dd
[08:26:57] <sufodnfaptinstal> what would be the command?
[08:27:26] <karlpinc> sufodnfaptinstal: (They probably have serial numbers, etc.  I forget the details.)
[08:27:40] <sufodnfaptinstal> sudo dd /media/(data) /media/(no data drive) bs=4k?
[08:28:08] <Affliction> no, you'll need the device name
[08:28:11] <Affliction> lsblk
[08:28:13] <sufodnfaptinstal> do i need to decrypt the drive with data before using dd?
[08:28:19] <Affliction> lsblk -f can give fileystem info
[08:28:29] <Affliction> nope, dd will copy the encrypted data
[08:28:36] <sufodnfaptinstal> so use sudo lsblk to get the names
[08:28:43] <sufodnfaptinstal> so use sudo lsblk -f to get the names
[08:28:45] <Affliction> that'll get you the device names
[08:28:57] <Affliction> if they're mounted (mountpoint in lsblk won't be empty), you should unmount them first
[08:29:06] <sufodnfaptinstal> okay
[08:29:12] <sufodnfaptinstal> i think they automatically try to mount
[08:29:18] <karlpinc> Affliction: Yeah. lsblk is simpler than checking the logs.
[08:29:22] <Affliction> umount mountpoint
[08:29:25] <Affliction> will unmount it

[08:30:50] <karlpinc> sufodnfaptinstal: You don't want the target to be mounted.  You _could_ have the source be mounted, but the filesystem won't be consistent on the target unless you also unmount it.

[08:36:02] <Affliction> if they're not plugged in, that could give you extra validation about which is the source. Plug in the source, look at lsblk, plug in the destination, take another look at lsblk

[08:58:26] <karlpinc> But sudo still wants a password.  I've used `id` to check that my user is in the ansible_adm group.  /var/log/auth.log is not helpful.
[08:58:30] <karlpinc> What to do?
[08:59:15] <Affliction> karlpinc: it does look right to me, but maybe I'm missing something too

[09:02:45] <karlpinc> Interesting.  If I add the line to /etc/sudoers, it works.  So the include is not working.  (What's up with that?)
[09:03:30] <Affliction> does /etc/sudoers have "#includedir /etc/sudoers.d"?

[15:49:38] <cosimone> Khepra: jelly: so the answer is yes?  i'm fully aware that there are alternatives available
[15:49:43] <Haohmaru> jelly one possibility would be to make the channel joinable and put +m in it and a topic+entrymsg
[15:50:04] <Khepra> cosimone: sorry, I don't know.
[15:50:33] <cosimone> np
[15:51:48] <Haohmaru> right now the worst that could happen is, if someone isn't on #debian, but is aware that there's a "#debian-next" channel, he'd /join it and end up here, possibly not noticing that he actually got redirected, and then he'd just ask his debian-next-grade questions here
[15:52:25] <Haohmaru> that's not critically bad
[15:53:14] <jelly> cosimone, no, I didn't test the one in bullseye at all
[15:53:14] <Khepra> and get thrown back in the infinite loop with !debian-next, and of course they won't see the OFTC part and will goto#1 and re-join and return here and ask again and....
[15:53:47] <Haohmaru> Khepra iirc that's how lasers work x_x
[15:54:13] <Khepra> jokes aside, if kicking is too radical, perhaps just let them join #debian-next@Libera, and have the bot auto-respond to anything they say with an informative message.
[15:54:29] <Khepra> the bot could kick them out after some time of (in)activity or something like that
[15:54:49] <Haohmaru> Khepra why not what i proposed - no need for a bot, let them sit there, unable to talk, untill they see the damn topic or entry message
[15:55:02] <Khepra> because they won't see it
[15:55:12] <Khepra> they'll just come hre and ask why they can't talk there.

[15:58:44] <cosimone> jelly: no problem, i was just looking for confirmation from other people
[15:59:02] <Haohmaru> i tend to ignore immediate responses that reference me ;P~
[15:59:11] <Haohmaru> did someone say anything? ;P~
[15:59:26] <Khepra> but if oyu keep talking, the bot will keep responding. I mean, if THAT's insufficient.... then no amount of topic or anything else would suffice.
[15:59:58] <Khepra> and you get a boot out after N posts or minutes.
[16:00:28] <Haohmaru> okay, i give up, that's less of an issue for me, since i don't really provide help in here too often
[16:00:40] <Haohmaru> a bigger concern i have is the +r here

[16:13:55] <Haohmaru> we don't have massive spam attacks now ;P~
[16:14:10] <Haohmaru> after the freenope ship sank, things here relaxed
[16:14:27] <kjetilho> nice that l0de is kept busy over there
[16:14:41] <Haohmaru> and the channels here were created from scratch, so old settings didn't magically appear

[16:15:26] <Haohmaru> but #debian owners took care to duplicate the same channel settings as in freenope, thus, duplicating the +r
[16:16:48] <Haohmaru> if you're innocent, +r is bad, +q at least allows you to get in and at least be coazy and listen
[16:17:11] <Khepra> so the only reason you're complaining is because you're lazy to set up sasl? if you set up sasl, you probably wouldn't even see that +r? or are you genuinely concerned about poor random anon help seekers who are denied the assistance?

[16:21:13] <Khepra> Haohmaru: so then now you want chanops to commit additional hours, just because you don't want to setup sasl?
[16:21:13] <Haohmaru> i didn't use SASL on freenode, but when the freenope ship started sinking and libera was founded - i made a new znc instance and set up SASL for @home immediately

[16:30:41] <Khepra> kjetilho: nobody reads /topic. that's like one of the Rules of the Internet.
[16:31:07] <kjetilho> that's just not true.
[16:31:52] <kjetilho> in any case, with +q$~a it is also trivial to write a bot which sends a personal notice to unregistered users joining.

[16:32:31] <Haohmaru> no need for a bot
[16:33:05] <Haohmaru> the only bad thing that can happen is a flood of unregistered users (bots, possibly), then an op can wake up and put +r temporarily
[16:33:37] <kjetilho> a flood of joins isn't bad
[16:33:44] <Khepra> so now, you ALSO need somoene on duty to react to floods of unreg'd users.

[18:58:17] *** Quits: han-solo (~han-solo@user/han-solo) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[18:58:45] <randall> ede: git tracks contents within the git repository. It internally uses .git/ to do that, which for all practical purposes you should ignore. It will not affect any ENV vars in any way.
[18:59:12] <ede> i think that's why i didn't ever really started using it. just a quick edit to a file and copy into place didn't seem possible

[19:00:41] <Khepra> starting point of what?
[19:00:48] <randall> ede: What are you talking about? This all doesn't make sense.
[19:01:21] <Khepra> I think ede's account might be hacked :)))
[19:01:26] <ede> without git i have someting like project/main.c or project/project. also a README.md. but i can't remember dozens of endless hashes.
[19:01:31] <randall> Maybe, or lack of coffee.
[19:01:37] <Khepra> ede: that has nothing to do with git
[19:01:43] *** Quits: spare (~vt5kucnem@user/spareproject) (Remote host closed the connection)
[19:01:54] <Khepra> git doesn't have any files outside of its .git directory (excepting .gitignore optional, and ~/.gitconfig)

[19:02:31] <ede> as i said, never really used it. read something about it, installed before i installed a new system the last time (didn't care anymore of something gets messed up), found it unusable.
[19:02:32] <randall> You can have a git workflow that doesn't involve hashes at all. In fact, most don't.
[19:02:32] <Khepra> in other words.  you have a project with 10k files in /home/ede/project/   mkay?  now you cd into it and type git init.   all it does is it creates /home/ede/project/.git/  and that's it.
[19:03:49] <Khepra> but from that point onward you can use git commands to track changes inside /home/ede/project/
[19:04:05] <ede> that's the point, i don't use cd and ls and stuff, i use mc
[19:04:06] <Khepra> you can add files to track, remove them, diff, log, ....
[19:04:13] <ede> it's not the  60s anymore
[19:04:21] <Khepra> dude
[19:04:37] <Khepra> that's irrelevant. you could use an IDE. the IDE or whatever, could create the repo for you with a mouseclick.
[19:04:40] <ede> i want the system to give me the info i need without requesting it every half minute
[19:04:53] <Khepra> it'd still just create ".git" inside your project dir, and not touch your files in any other way.
[19:05:00] <Khepra> ede: what info?
[19:05:00] <ede> aha
[19:05:22] <ede> like where i am, names of files, overall structure, quick access to files and contents...

[19:06:35] <ede> and all this is retype, retype, retype, not to talk about all the typos in each line
[19:06:35] <Khepra> git only tracks changes in files in the repo you "init"
[19:06:43] <ede> yeah, but because of this i use mc
[19:06:56] <Khepra> it has commands to show you which files changed, and show you the diff of it, and manage committing those changes, manage history of it etc...
[19:07:02] <Khepra> it's software versioning control, nothing else.
[19:07:16] <Khepra> rm -r /project/.git and it's gone. poof. as if it was never there.
[19:07:17] <ede> i have problems already using github, there's no user documentation for it.
[19:07:35] <Khepra> not git's fault tho
[19:07:45] <ede> dunno, maybe i just didn't find a good intro book yet.
[19:07:45] <Khepra> git is just microsoft SaaS to manage git repos
[19:09:01] <Khepra> git is like making snapshots of your source, in time. evrey time you commit, you make a snapshot. you can revert the code to any snapshot. you can create patches out of diffs between two snapshots.
[19:09:46] <ede> tiny dependency list, that's nice

[19:11:29] <Khepra> also, needn't be software. git is designed to track changes in text files. some people use it to maintain their /etc . you can also track changes in binary files but that's less effective because all the diff and patching tools are designed around showing you what changed in text.
