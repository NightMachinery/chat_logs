[01:16:14] <mago> It could be x, y, z but its not a variable.. Is becaus im going to combine them with other files that are already named 1.mp3, 2.mp3, 3.mp3
[01:16:28] <sarnold> Guest3081: hmm, dang, irc works best with error messages, but if you don't have any, that complicates things. what have you tried? where did it stop?
[01:16:30] <mago> So i will combine 1x.mp3 wth 1.mp3 with 2x.mp3 with 2.mp3

[01:22:51] <mago> What does that mean?

[05:34:53] <tomreyn> pacmann: hmm, could this be a problem with the nvme or the 'bios'? have those behaved erratic in the past?
[05:35:36] <tomreyn> pacmann: and how have you booted now? a live system?
[05:36:09] <pacmann> tomreyn: no they haven't so far
[05:36:49] <pacmann> tomreyn: i selected 'recovery mode' with the old kernel in grub
[05:37:14] <tomreyn> ah so this works? because you said the old kernel imaghes no longer work
[05:37:48] *** Joins: deliver (~deliver@2a02:3031:1:b505:c89:2e0c:3ba7:9263)
[05:37:49] <pacmann> tomreyn: yeah weirdly i get the error messages when just booting normal mode with all kernels but recovery mode works
[05:38:42] <tomreyn> so it's either a matter of "f*** nvidia" or cpu microcode updates

[05:39:25] <pacmann> i have to got in about 20 minutes unfortunately
[05:39:33] <pacmann> thank you for your time so far
[05:39:54] <tomreyn> so try booting Advanced -> 5.11.0-27-generic with the "nomodeset" option
[05:40:21] <tomreyn> i.e. the non-"(recovery mode)" one.
[05:40:46] *** Joins: idefix_ (~idefix@p5dc4d398.dip0.t-ipconnect.de)
[05:40:47] <pacmann> ok. I think that one didn't work before
[05:41:18] <tomreyn> then try the 5.11.0-25-generic non-recovery
[05:41:32] <tomreyn> but with the extra nomodeset" option
[05:41:39] <tomreyn> !bootparm

[19:27:31] <sharperguy_> network namespaces are created using the "ip netns" command
[19:28:02] <leftyfb> sharperguy_: what is your end goal? What are you trying to accomplish exactly?
[19:28:45] <sharperguy_> "ip netns exec" allows you to execute a command inside the namespace, but requires root, so i'd like to be able to have a way for a normal user to execute a command inside the namespace
[19:29:05] <leftyfb> why?
[19:29:11] <leftyfb> what is the end goal?
[19:29:26] <leftyfb> without mentioning the word "namespace"
