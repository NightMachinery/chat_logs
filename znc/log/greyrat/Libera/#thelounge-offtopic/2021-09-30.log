[01:25:26] <bookworm> MaxLeiter: wendy doesn't do that, it doesn't have the privilege to op. Shall I enable it? I thought we said we use the manual op via chanserv?
[01:31:40] <MaxLeiter> I dont recall saying that but its fine with me 
[01:31:45] <MaxLeiter> idc, was just checking

[01:33:41] <bookworm> if we want that, you need to add it to the CS access list though
[01:33:54] <bookworm> so that the bot can op at its discretion
