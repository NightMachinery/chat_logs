[05:47:21] <leah> clever: thanks for telling me about your project. i fell asleep earlier, was exhausted but now i'll make notes of what you told me. i will try out your software when i get the time
[05:47:34] <leah> than you for doing this important wor
[05:47:37] <leah> work*
[05:48:20] <clever> leah: i also just bumped into one of the libcamera guys, and learned some great info about the ISP
[05:48:22] <leah> and i agree with your logic; rpi has a huge userbase, so such work is definitely worthwhile
[05:48:32] <clever> https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/camera/raspberry-pi-camera-guide.pdf page 40
[05:48:36] <leah> ISP?
[05:48:50] <clever> the ISP deals with turning the raw image from the camera into a usable image
[05:49:00] <leah> ok
[05:49:17] <leah> what do cameras have to do with raspberry pis?
[05:49:21] <clever> basically, it has a ~12 stage pipeline, doing a wide range of transformations to the image
[05:49:27] <clever> the rpi has a CSI camera port
[05:49:32] <leah> ok
[05:49:34] <clever> so you can plug almost any CSI camera into the pi
[05:50:06] <clever> each of those 12 stages, has a range of configuration parameters, and outputs various stats, like say the average brightness of the whole image
[05:50:13] <leah> i'm very excited about your project because the raspberry pi is a very useful machine. it has amny uses and it's basically standard in the industry, for all kinds of tasks
[05:50:31] <clever> libcamera then has control loops, to read those stats, and adjust the configuration parameters of both the isp and the raw camera sensor
[05:50:40] <leah> so if it can be made blobless, that would be a win
[05:50:41] <clever> and the feedback loop then regulates for a good picture
[05:51:12] <clever> currently, a blob-less rpi, would loose control of the ISP, so the camera stuff would be very cpu intensive
[05:51:24] <leah> i have to say i'm guilty for using a raspberry pi. now with your project i don't feel guilt
[05:51:53] <clever> but i learned today, that the blob wrapper around the ISP, is very very dumb, and is basically just exposing the register set over an RPC
[05:52:18] *** Quits: xx (~xx@user/xx) (Quit: xx)
[05:52:22] <clever> so, in theory, i can just take a snapshot of the ISP configuration registers, change a parameter with the RPC, take another snapshot, and see what changed
[05:52:36] <leah> yeah don't assume that a proprietary program does a good job. devs get paid to finish the code, not perfect it
[05:52:42] <monkwitdafunk> Eh yo! I am waiting for androidAPS to be listed in the FSF directory before I hook together an insulin pump with a continuous glucose monitor
[05:53:02] <leah> there are things coreboot does better than proprietary firmware
[05:53:03] <clever> leah: originally, that entire control loop was inside the blob, so you had very little control over the control loop
[05:53:20] <clever> because it was originally doing camera stuff (mobile phone), before the arm core was even added
[05:53:34] <clever> but they have since moved that to linux userland and open source
[05:53:47] <clever> and are still incisting that the hw interface remain controlled by the blob :P
[05:54:08] <leah> i'm curious, your project mentions a small kernel and i take it your code runs on that, what's that all about?
[05:54:28] <leah> i'm not familiar with the architecture of the raspberry pi
[05:54:28] <clever> the rpi-open-firmware codebase, is a very dumb "kernel"
[05:54:55] <clever> it has no context switching, and just runs a series of steps in order, and then basically hangs
[05:54:56] <leah> if you run a linux kernel, is that other kernel still running?
[05:55:02] <clever> yeah
[05:55:11] <leah> so is it some kind of hypervisor
[05:55:25] <clever> more like a management engine
[05:55:30] <clever> its an entirely seperate cpu cluster
[05:55:33] <leah> ok
[05:55:39] <leah> that's what it sounded like
[05:55:49] <clever> and it can do management engine like isolation too
[05:56:00] <leah> and so you need that to work, to get periphereals working, and video drivers in linux working
[05:56:11] <leah> are the video drivers already free on that machine? (in linux)
[05:56:12] <clever> every rpi soc, has a dual-core VPU
[05:56:32] <clever> i dont have linux video output working yet, under the blob-less codebase
[05:56:43] <clever> but i believe i have all of the pieces to put that together
[05:56:51] <leah> the concept of what a management entire does is actually very good, if done with free software
[05:57:11] <clever> the VPU can do both scalar and vector operations
[05:57:29] <clever> https://github.com/hermanhermitage/videocoreiv/wiki/VideoCore-IV-Programmers-Manual#scalar-register-configuration
[05:57:41] <clever> each VPU core, has 32 registers, each 32bits
[05:57:52] <clever> but some are special purpuse, like stack, status, pc
[06:00:39] <clever> leah: the vpu also has a 64x64x8bit matrix file, and can operate on a set of 16 cells at once
[06:00:45] <clever> for (int i=0; i<16; i++) { int temp = a[i] * b[i]; if (store) c[i] = temp; if (accumulate) accumulator[i] += temp; }
[06:00:53] <clever> this entire operation, can be done in 2 clock cycles, at 500mhz
[06:01:10] <clever> on startup, the VPU runs a mask rom
[06:01:22] <clever> and that rom will load a 128kb .bin into cache-as-ram, and execute it
[06:01:50] <clever> the official .bin file, brings the ram controller online, then loads start(4).elf into ram, and executes it on the VPU
[06:02:20] <clever> start(4).elf then initializes all of the hardware, loads kernel.img into ram, turns the arm core on, and linux is now booting

[06:02:43] <clever> leah: all make sense so far?
[06:03:59] <clever> shared memory is used for the bulk of the messages and data passing, the mailbox is used to sync things up, and trigger checking the shared memory

[06:09:48] <leah> yes, yes that all makes sense at a glance
[06:10:08] <clever> where things start to get a bit management-engine like, is the extra MMU
[06:10:10] <leah> you mentioned ram controller. does your project also have to handle raminit?
[06:10:20] <clever> yep
[06:10:31] <clever> https://github.com/librerpi/rpi-open-firmware/blob/master/firmware/drivers/BCM2708ArmControl.cc#L161-L174
[06:10:34] <leah> so you are doing basically the rpi equivalent of porting coreboot to a machine
[06:10:36] <leah> nice work
[06:10:52] <clever> most of that was already done when i forked the project
[06:11:20] <leah> yeah i spoke to christina back in the day
[06:11:20] <clever> the main thing i did to rpi-open-firmware was fix a usb bug, and add some DT features
[06:11:23] <clever> and make it easier to build
[06:11:31] <leah> she explained some things to me
[06:11:36] <clever> there is a custom broadcom mmu, between "arm physical" and "vpu physical"
[06:11:43] <clever> it has 64 pages of 16mb each
[06:11:58] <leah> so do the modern raspberry pis (since 2016) all more or less run on the same architecture?
[06:12:03] <clever> that mmu, is what maps arm physical 0x2000_0000 to the MMIO at 0x7e00_0000
[06:12:07] <clever> yeah
[06:12:18] <leah> that makes things easier for you then
[06:12:39] <clever> using that broadcom custom mmu, you can just omit a 16mb chunk of ram from the arm's view of things
[06:12:59] <clever> no matter how badly the arm core is exploited, it can just never issue a load/store to that hidden block
[06:14:00] <clever> the problem, where i need docs to solve, is how to actually keep that security
[06:14:14] <clever> if the arm can configure DMA, then you can just use DMA to go around the firewall
[06:15:20] <clever> https://github.com/librerpi/rpi-open-firmware/blob/master/firmware/sdram.c#L311-L335
[06:15:31] <clever> leah: this is all of the ram-init code, specifically, where it does read/write to MR's inside the ram
[06:16:13] <clever> leah: in theory, i can use that to implement suspend to ram
[06:16:26] <leah> amazing that this still works today
[06:16:32] <leah> (on newer raspberry pis)
[06:16:42] <clever> it works on the pi0 to pi3
[06:16:57] <clever> pi4 completely changed ram-init, and i'm lost trying to solve it
[06:17:02] <leah> ah
[06:17:20] <leah> pi0 to pi3 is still a pretty big userbase
[06:17:24] <clever> yeah
[06:17:26] <leah> lots of those will be around for years
[06:18:20] <clever> from what ive read elsewhere, you can write to a certain MR, to configure the ram chip to refresh itself
[06:18:29] <clever> you can then just shut the soc off entirely, and the ram wont loose contents
[06:18:49] <clever> and next time you "boot", detect that, restore state, and resume
[06:20:42] <clever> but, due to the design of the PCB, you cant actually cut power to just the soc
[06:20:51] <clever> so i'm not sure you can save much energy doing that trick

[06:28:49] <clever> leah: also, if your willing to rely on a raminit blob, you could use the closed rpi4 eeprom, but an open start4.elf in the next stage
[06:29:10] <clever> that would still give you control of the management-engine level features
[06:31:15] <leah> yeah
[06:31:29] <leah> so it's only raminit that they changed?
[06:31:48] <clever> large chunks changed everywhere
[06:31:56] <clever> i havent been able to get the arm core online yet
[06:32:08] <clever> something unknown has changed, to support ram over 1gig in size
[06:32:21] <clever> the 2d and 3d subsystems have changed, to support 4k resolutions
[06:32:39] <clever> some modules like the PL011 uart have multiplied
[06:33:20] <clever> most of the changes, are a clear evolution, so i'm still familiar with the hw, and just need to write drivers for both versions
[06:33:28] <clever> but the ddr4, pci-e, and xhci, are entirely new
[06:33:44] <clever> so i have no starting point

[06:35:26] <clever> when using the official firmware, the boot chain looks like this:
[06:35:36] <clever> maskrom -> bootcode.bin -> start.elf -> kernel.img
[06:35:45] <clever> with start.elf and kernel.img remaining running, and sharing the hw
[06:36:03] <clever> but when using rpi-open-firmware, it skips a step, maskrom -> bootcode.bin -> zImage
[06:36:47] <clever> https://github.com/librerpi/rpi-open-firmware/blob/master/firmware/arm_monitor.c#L95-L105
[06:37:20] <clever> leah: rpi-open-firmware will basically hang in this loop once linux has started, but a mailbox IRQ from linux will cause line 60 to execute
[06:37:41] <clever> i partially implemented the same mailbox property api as the blob, so it could be compatible with the linux driver
[06:38:03] <clever> but, the entire executable, must fit within 128kb, which is a bit restrictive
[06:38:05] *** Joins: trekkie1701c (~trekkie17@user/trekkie1701c)
[06:40:00] <clever> leah: when using the LK codebase, its instead maskrom -> bootcode.bin -> lk.elf -> lk.bin -> zImage
[06:40:09] <clever> and the size limits are much less of a problem
[06:40:31] <clever> but that final `lk.bin -> zImage` step isnt working yet
[06:40:35] <leah> sounds fun
[06:40:45] <leah> working under constraints forces you to be creative
[06:41:13] <clever> earlier today, i was checking the math on driving the 2d and 3d systems, but skipping raminit on purpose :P
[06:41:25] <clever> in theory, i can just barely do it
[06:41:33] <clever> but the entire executable would have to clock in under 38kb
[06:42:20] <clever> a 740x480 rgba8888 frame, is over 1mb, and would never fit in the 128kb l2 cache
[06:42:24] <clever> leah: guess what i can do to shave it down?
[06:43:55] <leah> what?
[06:44:08] <clever> first step, is rgb565, 16bit pixels
[06:44:20] <clever> that cuts a frame down to 675kb
[06:44:33] <clever> but it still wont fit, so i then have to get real fancy
[06:45:08] <clever> if i make a 720x64 image, and just repeat that down the screen
[06:45:27] <clever> so the 2d composition unit, just reads a 64 scanline buffer, repeatedly, to fill out the 480 lines of image
[06:45:45] <clever> then, i just have to race the scanline, and re-fill that buffer before it repeats, with the next 64 scanlines
[06:46:05] <clever> that gets me down to 90kb of image buffer
[06:46:21] <clever> and only 38kb of room for code!
[06:46:43] <clever> in theory, it could work, but it would be pretty insane :P
[06:46:48] <leah> 128k ought to be enough for just about anyone
[06:46:56] <leah> 38k rather
[06:47:14] <clever> 64 scanlines is as small as i can go
[06:47:31] <clever> because the 3d core, generates 64x64 or 32x32 chunks of the frame
[06:47:53] <clever> in 32x32 mode, i could be rendering the bottom slice, while i display the top slice

[06:53:36] <clever> it is mostly compatible with the closed bootcode.bin, so they can be used inter-changably, depending on if you want pure open, or need netboot from the closed stage-1

[06:59:03] <leah> what you're describing basically sounds like what BUP (BringUP) does in Intel ME
[06:59:34] <clever> i'm currently skipping u-boot, because it makes some assumptions about the system
[06:59:43] <clever> u-boot tries to use the mailbox to ask the blob how much ram the system has
[06:59:54] <clever> then just hangs, because i didnt implement that part of the firmware
[07:00:18] <leah> is it needed?
[07:00:20] <clever> and rpi-open-firmware already had a linux bootloader, so i just copied it over: https://github.com/librerpi/lk-overlay/blob/master/app/linux-bootloader/loader.c
[07:00:51] <clever> so i'm able to skip uboot
[07:01:10] <clever> in theory, i could replace that stage, with a tianocore build
[07:01:13] <leah> skip it and directly boot a linux kernel?
[07:01:20] <clever> yeah
[07:01:24] <leah> :)
[07:02:02] <leah> can always modify uboot itself
[07:02:06] <clever> yeah
[07:03:06] <clever> the biggest problem ive run into, is that the arm core cant configure any of the 2d subsystem
[07:03:21] <clever> so there is no way to use the already open-sourced 2d drivers
[07:03:27] <clever> without heavily modifying them
[07:03:38] <leah> with your software is its current state, could i boot a linux kernel and run a uart or ssh, and use spi?

[07:05:02] <clever> the sd drivers, where changing that pin back to input, by accident
[07:05:24] <clever> a lot of distro's are opting to use uboot, to hide what makes the rpi special
[07:05:38] <clever> so you just throw the closed blobs and uboot into a fat32, and forget about it
