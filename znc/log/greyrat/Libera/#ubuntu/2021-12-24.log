[02:38:32] <decimalpig1980> that's for currently available XPS DE.  haven't bought it yet.  I'm replacing a ~4 year old XPS 2-in-1 that shipped w Windows.  Successfully put Ubuntu on it, but never got around to ironing out all trackpad flukiness...  What I'm wondering about is strategies for identifying/saving drivers so that if I have to reinstall OS, I can quickly get
[02:38:33] <decimalpig1980> all hardware working...  Any thoughts?
[02:39:16] <leftyfb> decimalpig1980: if you buy an XPS with Ubuntu preloaded, everything will work
[02:39:57] <decimalpig1980> I know and am glad that is the case, haha, but what if I need to reinstall/upgrade OS subsequently?

[02:44:18] <decimalpig1980> gotcha.  i've had great experiences w Ubuntu and other distros on desktops/RPis/etc, but this 2-in-1 was not an easy experience.  is it the case that 2-in-1's touch screens, etc. are kind of "exotic hardware" so it's less likely Ubuntu will just work on first install?

[07:51:31] <comet23> is there an alternative i can use?
[07:52:19] <Bashing-om> !12.10 | comet23
[07:52:19] <ubottu> comet23: Ubuntu 12.10 (Quantal Quetzal) was the 17th release of Ubuntu.  Support ended on May 16th, 2014. See !eol, !upgrade and https://ubottu.com/y/quantal
[07:52:27] <jhutchins> comet23: You might want to stick to a 32b environment for the sake of compatibility.
[07:52:45] <jhutchins> So ...
[07:52:48] <jhutchins> !upgrade
[07:52:49] <ubottu> For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes - see also http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/upgrade
[07:53:25] <jhutchins> I would imagine that some things like the compile utilities and libraries may have changed enough to cause you trouble.
[07:53:31] <robertparkerx> does apache2 2.4.41 apply the latest patch
[07:53:59] <Bashing-om> comet23: the repo for 12.10 ^ no longer exists as you once knew it. maybe lubuntu still has a 32 bit spin . let me check.
[07:54:16] <jhutchins> comet23: There's really nothing wrong with using an older version like that without updates if you're within a school/classroom environment, just don't go using it for normal broad web cruising.
[07:55:09] <jhutchins> comet23: In fact, it might be very informative and useful to take what you're learning on that version and see what it takes to port it to the current version.
[07:55:25] <jhutchins> comet23: Just set up a dual-boot install and have at it.
[07:55:41] <comet23> i'm using vms
[07:55:55] <comet23> i have 64gb ddr5 ram so i think it'll be more than enough :D

[07:58:09] <jhutchins> robertparkerx: Are you sure it doesn't already?  Ubuntu version numbers are not the same as upstream version numbers.
[07:58:27] <robertparkerx> It says build was in 10-14
[07:58:34] <robertparkerx> I did apache2 -v
[07:58:37] <jhutchins> comet23: So stick with the school version for school, and whatever you like for your own use.
[07:58:46] <comet23> i can't install anything on it
[07:59:10] <jhutchins> robertparkerx: You really have to follow the Ubuntu CVE tracker to know what they've patched.
[07:59:24] <comet23> when i did apt-get update && apt-get upgrade i kept getting failed to fetch errors
[07:59:41] <comet23> all i want is to install things from the terminal like a normal person
[08:00:05] <jhutchins> comet23: Right, as shown above, there is no repository to draw the upgrades from.
[08:01:16] <comet23> if i get any 32bit linux will it be the same as ubuntu?
[08:01:46] <Bashing-om> comet23: https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/lubuntu/releases/bionic/release/ has a 32 bit image - but be aware that the desktop (3 years support_is also EOL while kernel space will be supported until 2023.

[14:24:32] <nichlas> Can someone help me with an Nvidia issue. *Software & Updates* claim that there is a manually installed driver (and will not allow me to install one). If I run the newest Nvidia driver with the "--uninstall" flag, it claims that there is no driver installed. Can I change a config somewhere to tell it that no such driver is installed and have it allow me to install the normal one?
[14:25:20] <lotuspsychje> nichlas: pastebin; sudo lshw -C video for us please?
[14:26:21] <nichlas> lotuspsychje: https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/4YP2Xp5Qd2/

[14:27:42] <nichlas> I don't have nvidia-smi
[14:27:45] <oerheks> nvidia drivers want kernel 5.5 or higher
[14:28:17] <lotuspsychje> type that in terminal nichlas
[14:28:20] <nichlas> inux nichlas-MS-7B79 5.11.0-43-generic #47~20.04.2-Ubuntu SMP Mon Dec 13 11:06:56 UTC 2021 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
[14:28:48] <nichlas> Do you mean all drivers want 5.5 or just the newest?
[14:28:54] <oerheks> i would use 'sudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstall
[14:29:01] <oerheks> yes, but you are good, 5.11
[14:29:39] <nichlas> I've started ubuntu-drivers
[14:29:48] <nichlas> seems to be installing stuff
[14:30:03] <oerheks> :-)
[14:30:26] <nichlas> now I have `nvidia-smi`
[14:30:47] <nichlas> And driver 470.86
[14:31:26] <lotuspsychje> a lot of bugs related to 5.11 and nvidia also
[14:33:33] <nichlas> I'm just getting started. Now I'll see if I can get any games working.
[14:33:59] <oerheks> have fun!

[21:58:08] <tomreyn> supercool: this (second line of text on the screenshot you posted - consider posting text as text in the future instead) is the direct (graphics) rendering manager (DRM) reporting that it was unable to 'send' the vmware graphics driver (vmwgfx) generated log messages to the 'host log'. this doesn't really explain how this failed to to be sent, nor does it hint at file system space allocation causing this issue.
[21:58:45] <tomreyn> (the line above this is that of a file system check, but this is most likely entirely unrelated)

[22:00:13] <supercool> tomreyn: yes, I also found this context suport but I think it is unrelated to my situation because everything was working just fine before the disk get full. It happened twice this week. I still can't figure why it is happening.
[22:03:10] <tomreyn> supercool: that's what logs can help with. (physical) disks don't usually run full, file systems do, and you usually have more than one of those. so the first step should be to fid out which one ran full, how it did, or why, and then how to prevent it from doing that again.
[22:03:46] <tomreyn> journalctl lets you check system logs, including that of a specific point in time.

[22:05:30] *** Joins: magnavox__ (~MagnaVox@user/MagnaVox)
[22:05:37] <tomreyn> if the file system the logs are stored on runs full, there is a chance that this will prevent logging to fail (this requires file system space, too), however some file systems would preserve a small fraction of space for things run by root to continue running in such an event.
