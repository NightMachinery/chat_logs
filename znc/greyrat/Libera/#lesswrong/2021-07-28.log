[00:24:44] <gwern> ...japanese teahouse by a priest who was unsure if we were to be accepted with open arms or purged. my friend was blood-tested first and had a staggering 5k units of magical power detected, a level surpassed only by the Founder and his direct offspring, and far exceeding the diluted blood of the priest in puissance. but, the reading wasn't from his blood! the perplexed priest turns his...

[00:47:25] <two2thehead> kuudes, s0ph1a feep : "Why do people seek out frightening leisure activities such as horror films and haunted attractions, and does the experience benefit them in any way? In this article, we address these questions through two separate studies. In Study 1, we asked American horror fans (n = 256) why they like horror and identified three overall types of horror fans which we term “Adrenaline Junkies,” “White Knucklers,” and “Dark Copers.”
[00:47:25] <two2thehead>  In Study 2, we collected data from Danish visitors at a haunted house attraction (n = 258) and replicated the findings from Study 1 by identifying the same three types of horror fans. Furthermore, we show that these three types of horror fans report distinct benefits from horror experiences. Adrenaline Junkies reported immediate enjoyment, White Knucklers reported personal growth, and Dark Copers reported both. These results suggest that 
[00:47:26] <two2thehead> frightening leisure activities are not just an outlet for Adrenaline Junkies and sensation-seekers, but that the allure of horror has as much to do with its potential as a stimulus for personal growth as it has with enjoyment."

For instance, horror fiction offers an opportunity to practice emotion regulation strategies that could be useful for related situations in the real world (Scrivner & Christensen, 2021). In support of this idea, one study found 
[00:52:54] <two2thehead> that horror fans appeared to have greater psychological resilience during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic than non-horror fans (Scrivner et al., 2021).

It is possible, for instance, that the self-reflection that occurs after recreational horror is different in Dark Copers and White Knucklers.

Dark Copers may also be a group that

Anecdotal evidence suggests that some individuals may find solace from their anxiety and depression through using horror entertainment (e.g., Grisafi 2016; Turner 2017), which aligns well with items on the Dark Coper scale. Correspondingly, Scrivner and Christensen (2021) have argued that horror possesses particular cognitive attractors for individuals with elevated anxiety and may hold therapeutic value in

[01:48:09] <Logos01> rsaarelm: Correct, but it's also gore-heavy.
[01:48:18] <Logos01> Which is *why* it works so well as a demarcation tool.
[01:48:37] <dbohdan> It seemed schlocky even to kid-me
[01:51:24] <Logos01> dbohdan: Virus? Oh yes. I still can't help but make comparisons to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-MeyVy4Y7M

[01:51:32] <rsaarelm> So what's with the Virus trailer? It looks like one of those sharknado style movies.
[01:51:52] <Logos01> rsaarelm: It was low-budget horror back in 1999.
[01:52:15] <Logos01> The movie itself is actually kiind of transhuman horror.
[01:52:32] <two2thehead> it needed a sequel
[01:52:33] <rsaarelm> I think I classify Event Horizon in the same bucket as The Shining, don't see why it'd be contentious.
[01:52:41] <two2thehead> it wasn't very good but it was fun
[01:53:00] <two2thehead> plus, you can have the virus affect a LOT more stuff now
[01:53:08] <Logos01> Alien computer virus takes over and blows up MIR, then infects a Russian trawlership, and proceeds to convert the crew into parts for its incipient robot uprising.
[01:53:20] <rsaarelm> Virus reminds me of the Leviathan movie that had Peter Weller.
[01:53:41] <Logos01> two2thehead: The problem with trying that is that you'd lose on one of the primary elements of the horror genre: isolation.
[01:53:44] <dbohdan> Recently I watch _Coherence_, and it was genuinely well-acted, clever in spots, and tense.  I enjoyed it, despite a kind of dumb ending.  It is notable for being a _Primer_-style high-concept, low-budget production.  https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2866360/

[01:54:07] <two2thehead> Logos01, ah
[01:54:14] <dbohdan> High-concept, low-budget, and quickly filmed, too
[01:54:17] <two2thehead> yes.. I hadn't considered that part
[01:54:22] <two2thehead> dbohdan, :D
[01:54:34] <two2thehead> fun, right? Reality distortion genre
[01:54:51] <Logos01> two2thehead: That being said, if you were willing to go zombie apocalypse movie it would make a *GREAT* "twist" on that genre.
[01:55:14] <Logos01> The zombies are cyborgs made using cadavers as parts by an alien cybervirus.
[01:55:23] <two2thehead> alien computer virus causing zombie apocalypse. Hmm. That'd be original
[01:55:24] <dbohdan> two2thehead: Yep
[01:55:26] <two2thehead> Logos01, +1
[01:56:07] <Logos01> Only problem is it'd have to be pretty 'dumb' about it overall because, like, designer zombies with industrial components is kiiiinda hard for the plucky ragtag crew of survivors to not immediately go splat in.
[01:56:49] <two2thehead> yeah. Just make the zombies put on some motorcycle leathers
[01:57:05] <Logos01> Well I guess you could try a more Resident Evil approach? The virus might have some locations where it has, like, mainframes that are superintelligent and better designed but the wild/feral copies are just running on necrotic meat and cellphones and so are dumber.
[01:57:13] <two2thehead> yeah,
[01:57:29] <two2thehead> that could be why there are different types of zombies
[01:57:49] <two2thehead> some can run fast, others can hear in the dark
[01:57:50] <Logos01> two2thehead: See, in case of zombie apocalypse always find your nearest motorcycle hobbyist shop and gear up in leathers, gloves, boots, and helmet.
[01:58:15] <two2thehead> yep
[01:58:18] <Logos01> Leaves basically your neck as vulnerable but even that not so much because they are usually high-necked to cut off wind.
[01:58:37] <Logos01> And unless they're, y'know, T-virus or cyber zombies they aren't getting the bite strength to puncture.
[01:59:48] <Logos01> There's also the problem of how cyberzombie plague successfully spreads itself.
[02:01:28] <Logos01> Unless you gave it, like, bodyjacking abilities on unmodified corpses.

[02:28:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> Having moved away from here to ... well, not NYC, is the only relevant thing
[02:28:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> So we decided to do this particular touristy thing, and boy am I glad we did
[02:28:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's an *incredible* view
[02:29:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> I had not been to any skyscraper observation deck in the city since the original WTC.

[02:30:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anywhere
[02:30:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> Then we went to High Line Park (also cool, we walked down the whole length)
[02:30:49] <gwern> 9/11 never forget
[02:31:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> High Line Park is on an elevated train line, which, to again be clear, is completely outdoors
[02:31:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> And *does* require masks.
[02:31:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Well, to be precise, there are "WEAR MASKS" signs all over it. No one was wearing masks.)
[02:32:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> (At one point we passed by a whole stack of folded-up spare "WEAR MASKS" signs, surrounded by more people without masks.)
[02:34:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Actually I am fairly sure I know what was happening there. You see, there was a party of four people: an adult woman, a teenage girl, a younger (7-8 year old) girl, and another teenage girl. As far as I could tell it was mother, daughter, younger daughter, daughter's friend. The first two were wearing pride flag masks, the latter two, regular paper masks.
[02:34:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> My guess is that this was "daughter got into woke shit, convinced her mom to also wear pride mask, but mom does not actually believe virus is real"

[02:35:08] <saturn2> ahh
[02:37:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway the whole mask situation here is just very "no one believes in physical reality, no one's reasons for doing anything have anything to do with stated reasons"
[02:37:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> Policies of restaurants and miscellaneous retail are just a random mishmash
[02:38:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> Mask required, no masks required, masks recommended, masks required even if vaccinated, masks not required if vaccinated (but how do they check? they don't, obvs)
[02:39:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> Totally random, two shops right next to each other in the same shopping plaza with diametrically opposed policies, despite literally having no doors and sharing a single centrally air-conditioned airspace
[02:39:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's an utter farce
[02:40:20] <Betawolf> but this is surely ideal, as people operating in different realities can live practically alongside each other
[02:41:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> Also there's one spot on High Line Park where there's an art installation which is just a life-sized sculpture/mockup of a Predator drone

[03:35:00] <feepbot> <gwern> 'After addressing the challenge in distinguishing ‘animal release’ ( fangsheng) from other acts of compassion towards animals, it becomes apparent that the earliest description of animal release rituals we can find is not from a Buddhist source, but from a Daoist work known as the Liezi. The passage in the Liezi reads as follows:  'The people of Han-tan presented doves
[03:35:01] <feepbot> to Chao Chien-tzu on New Year’s morning. He was delighted and richly rewarded them. When a visitor asked the reason, Chien-tzu explained: ‘We release living things on New Year’s Day as a gesture of kindness.’ [The visitor replied]: ‘The people know you wish to release them, so they vie with each other to catch them, and many of the doves die. If you wish to keep them
[03:35:01] <feepbot> alive, it would be better to forbid the people to catch them. When you release doves after catching them, the kindness does not make up for the mistake.’ ‘You are right,’ said Chien-tzu. (Graham 1960, 178)'' <-- incredibly ironic
[03:40:00] <feepbot> <gwern> 'Williams clearly illustrated this ethical dilemma in his study of animal release in Medieval Japan: Taira Masayuki’s research has shown that in the medieval period, the shrine was extremely concerned about having enough fish and clams to release (usually in the range of one to three thousand). Thus, more than triple the number were captured several weeks ahead of time to
[03:40:01] <feepbot> ensure that enough animals would be available by the time the state envoy arrived. In other words, if three thousand fish were to be released at the hōjō-e, a total of nine thousand would need to be captured and purchased by the shrine with the understanding that two-thirds of them might die before they could be released.

In

Finally, further delays were no longer possible, and, in a conversation with Bluma, he said:
[04:13:07] <feepbot> “Forgive me, I have to dismiss you, but promise me that tomorrow you will go and take me to court.” From the formal standpoint, Jewish ethnicity did not constitute a legal reason for firing someone.

[07:14:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> Today when I was in Manhattan I purchased a couple of black and white cookies from a fancy-ass cake shop
[07:14:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> Let us now find out how good they are...
[07:15:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> Wow these are not authentic B&W cookies at all
[07:16:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> Cookie itself is too cake-y. Shape is wrong (cylindrical instead of domed). Application pattern of icing is wrong (full coverage of both faces, instead of only on flat face).
[07:16:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> Icing is too soft. No discernible vanilla flavor in the white one.
[07:18:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> Cookie itself is decent though, in an absolute sense. Chocolate frosting flavor is acceptable, even if texture is wrong.
[07:18:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> I rate this 3 out of 5 cookies.
[07:18:52] <saturn2> icing on both sides? wtf
[07:20:20] <gwern> the quest for B&W continues
[07:21:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hm. Odd aftertaste. Kind of weird artificial sodium flavor. Downgraded to 2.5 out of 5 cookies.

[08:24:52] <PlanckWalk> otoburb: Another way of rephrasing the title "We have no idea what work 85% of people are going to be able to do in 9 years"
[08:25:28] <PlanckWalk> (It's still bullshit, but more obviously bullshit)
[08:25:44] <otoburb> People previously would throw up their hands in despair, but there seems to be more people blurting out "UBI" 
[08:26:12] <PlanckWalk> Isn't that the same thing?
[08:26:47] <otoburb> Despair seems more productive in some way
[08:27:49] <PlanckWalk> I love the careful choice of phrasing in the quotes used in the article.
[08:28:12] <PlanckWalk> "Instead of expecting workers to bear the brunt of finding work, work will compete for the best resource to complete the job"
[08:28:28] <PlanckWalk> So what about the 99% of workers who *aren't* the "best resource"?
[08:28:47] <PlanckWalk> (Assuming the study wasn't a complete pile of bullshit)
[08:29:05] <adiabatic> employers make do with people who aren't A players
[08:29:20] <PlanckWalk> Yeah, but they don't exactly go out and hunt them down to hire them
[08:29:48] <PlanckWalk> So it seems to be describing exactly the same situation as now, in nice sounding words.
[08:30:23] <PlanckWalk> Employers seek out the top-tier talent, and everyone else has to hunt an employer who will grudgingly accept them.
[08:31:12] <PlanckWalk> (Except in the study, it's not "top tier in your area", it's "top tier in the world")
[08:40:41] <Nivim> I guess I'm out of date on this; I thought the current catastrophizing was about how the jobs wouldn't be there at all because automation is going to be even more extreme and corporations will be able to reduce costs more by simply keeping a small fraction of the living workers with their living wages.
[08:40:47] <PlanckWalk> I recall an article from the 60s that predicted that the 70s would be the decade where everyone shifted over to freelance piecework.
[08:40:56] <PlanckWalk> (I read it in the 90s, so that was funny)
[08:41:25] <otoburb> So, not wrong; just early. 
[08:41:57] <PlanckWalk> Everyone moving to freelance piecework is always 10 years away
[08:42:03] <otoburb> Kind of like AGI. 
[08:42:17] <PlanckWalk> Well, usually 30 years for that but yes.
[08:42:58] <PlanckWalk> Also commercial fusion plants, and I think those are more likely.
[08:44:49] <PlanckWalk> (Than "everyone going freelance", not AGI.  I have no idea really how likely AGI is in the next 30 years)
[08:51:57] <PlanckWalk> Think of pretty much any organization that exists today, from hairdressing salon to Google.  What would you put as "probability that this organization will eliminate at least 85% of its current work and replace it with something unknown and do everything by short-term individualized contracts?"
[08:52:31] <PlanckWalk> (Including "this organization will no longer exist")

[10:05:38] <rmmh> ah yeah it's genetic, right? missing an enzyme to process chopped oxygen?
[10:06:50] <Logos01> ivan: AC is better than heat for leaving humidity in the air, though.
[10:06:53] <Logos01> Well, relative humidity.
[10:07:12] <ivan> yes, I loathe heater air
[10:07:15] <ivan> I tape my vent shut
[10:07:46] <Logos01> The increased heat increases the maximum absolute humidity, which in turn lowers the relative humidity and makes the air more prone to sucking moisture out of you.
[10:08:00] <rmmh> my hvac system has a humidifier. it's nice.
[10:08:55] <ivan> I used to have a foam mattress without a mattress protector. this was very bad for both the mattress and my own humidity homeostasis
[10:09:05] <Logos01> Keeping the AC on just induces condensation.
[10:09:26] <Logos01> rmmh: You miiiiiight wanna check the whole-house humidifier at some point. They can become petri dishes.
[10:10:05] <Logos01> Amusingly, if your AC is a ductless heat pump you won't have the moisture loss from keeping the AC running.
[10:10:49] <Logos01> (Because the moisture condensation of interior air remains *in* the interior area, rather than air being schlepped around conduits and then squeezed.)

[10:17:05] <saturn2> "the moisture condensation of interior air remains *in* the interior area" wrong
[10:17:14] <dbohdan2> Logos01: Ah, I see
[10:17:18] <saturn2> it goes out through a drain tube
[10:17:50] <dbohdan2> Unless the tube is blocked -- then it runs down the wall
[10:17:55] <saturn2> yes
[10:18:49] <Logos01> saturn2: I'm talking about ductless heatpumps there.
[10:19:11] <Logos01> The moisture condensation of the interior air remains in the interior area because the air that moisture is in never leaves the interior area.
[10:19:27] <saturn2> in heating mode? then it's the same as any other form of heat
[10:19:41] <Logos01> Same conditions apply.
[10:20:00] <saturn2> but that's not what you said
[10:20:10] <Logos01> Because I Wasn't talking about heating, but cooling.
[10:20:20] <Logos01> But seriously it's the same.
[10:20:24] <saturn2> ok, so you were just wrong
[10:20:35] <Logos01> ductless heatpumps never draw air out of the interior area. Period.
[10:20:47] <Logos01> What the fuck are you trying to do here dude? Don't do this again.
[10:20:58] <saturn2> and trying to use some irrelevant squid ink to avoid admitting it

[10:31:21] <feep[work]> unrelatedly, "fire fox" according to clip https://i.imgur.com/mJOUrWg.png
[10:33:38] <saturn2> being wrong and/or disagreeing with me are both completely fine, the problem is being wrong, not expressing *any* doubt when questioned, then trying to weasel out of admitting it
[10:33:57] <feep[work]> I do not think that is a problem.
[10:34:31] <saturn2> how are we going to get less wrong if people can get away with that?
[10:35:15] <feep[work]> it is not the job of the mods to make participants "less wrong" according to their standard.
[10:35:42] <feep[work]> at any rate, I don't think such a thing actually makes people less wrong
[10:35:45] <feep[work]> I think it mostly makes people leave
[10:38:03] <dbohdan2> I thought this time and the last saturn2 set +q on Logos01 for saying something rude while being wrong, not being wrong per se
[10:38:21] <feep[work]> I saw nothing particularly rude above
[10:38:51] <adiabatic> I'm too sleepy to detect rudeness or weaseling, otherwise I'd chime in
[10:38:57] <Obormot\Gaia> I agree with this moderation action
[10:39:05] <feep[work]> I think logos01 is just confidently wrong, but that's fine.
[10:39:16] * dbohdan2 shrugs
[10:39:18] <feep[work]> Obormot\Gaia: you really shouldn't.
[10:39:26] <ivan> can we get a source on ductless heat pump AC and humidity
[10:39:39] <feep[work]> Obormot\Gaia: or rather, you better be fully confident that your opinion aligns with the mods' if you support this general approach.
[10:39:42] <saturn2> i can't *make* people less wrong, but the channel is for people who *want* to become less wrong. people who don't care should leave
[10:39:59] <ivan> "When compared to traditional air conditioners, ductless air conditioners are very effective at removing humidity from the indoor environment, and they are efficient to operate. They remove moisture from the air while cooling the air with greater flexibility than other units"
[10:40:19] <Obormot\Gaia> feep[work]: If people refuse to engage in getting-less-wrong as a process, that is bad, and if they leave instead of *either* shutting up *or* engaging in some productive discussion where they at least attempt to figure out if they're wrong or not, that's working as intended
[10:40:50] <Obormot\Gaia> feep[work]: My opinions do not align with the mods' on many things but I do not anticipate this kind of thing being a problem despite that
[10:40:57] * feep[work] shrugs
[10:41:14] <feep[work]> my opinions do align with most people here on most things, but I still anticipate this kind of thing being a problem.
[10:41:21] <feep[work]> or rather, it being a problem for people I like.

[10:41:52] <dbohdan2> It isn't even properly on fire
[10:41:57] <adiabatic> stupid and probably not useful question time: do you anticipate it being a problem for people here you don't like?
[10:42:00] <feep[work]> I see two possible outcomes here, first people having to hedge absolutely everything with "well as far as I know" and "I once read" and that sort of meaningless filler
[10:42:20] <feep[work]> and second the *result* being mod action for confidently disagreeing.
[10:42:36] <feep[work]> I think frankly logos01's reaction above is well understandable.
[10:42:45] <Obormot\Gaia> Which reaction
[10:42:49] <feep[work]> ignoring saturn2.
[10:43:44] <feep[work]> I think this is not an issue of wanting or not wanting to become less wrong, it's an issue of logos01 not having the social reading ability or cognitive skill to *phrase* his position in a way that *signals* his willingness to correct himself based on external information
[10:44:06] <feep[work]> and I really hate excluding people on that basis.
[10:44:56] <adiabatic> I don't remember being much of a hedger (heh) but I could've sworn I've changed my mind here on stuff and things
[10:46:51] <feep[work]> like, lesswrong of all people should not kick out autists for low social.
[10:46:52] <saturn2> i don't think any other regular has ever come close to how logos01 was acting
[10:47:03] <feep[work]> of all places*
[10:47:31] <feep[work]> I can fully relate to Logos01's reaction frankly.
[10:47:43] <feep[work]> I wouldn't act like that, but it fits into my "normal human model".

[10:50:04] <ivan> saturn2: I've done enough googling to see that Logos01 might be right about the mini-split systems he was talking about
[10:50:23] <saturn2> oh?
[10:50:30] <feep[work]> ^ and this is why mods DO NOT ARBITRATE RIGHT AND WRONG.
[10:50:54] <ivan> something about "Mini-split systems are capable of drying some of the added moisture during warmer months. Unfortunately they are not designed to dehumidify in cold weather and do not pull moisture in the winter."
[10:51:05] <ivan> still need to find some proper science comparing to vented systems maybe
[10:51:07] <feep[work]> ivan: I mean, that's still compatible with saturn2's view
[10:51:10] <saturn2> that is, again, about heating mode
[10:51:25] <ivan> oh I see
[10:51:35] <feep[work]> but like, the fact that googling is being pulled into it, that sources are being quoted, is precisely what you did not do saturn2 to try and convince Logos01 
[10:51:48] <feep[work]> and frankly I think that mod decision was not even in the *spirit* of becoming less wrong at all.
[10:51:58] <dbohdan2> adiabatic: Thanks, that's useful information to me
[10:53:33] <saturn2> my decision was in response to a pattern of behavior over the last several weeks, not just this one thing about the air conditioners
[10:53:54] <feep[work]> I think logos01's behavior was in reaction to the same pattern on your end.
[10:54:17] <feep[work]> my opinion is that you should ignore him and abstain from modding him at all. you two clearly have some bad pattern.
[10:55:08] <feep[work]> also this sort of op behavior is the sort of thing that makes people fork channels. We're not there yet, but ...
[10:56:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> We can't just let people keep saying wrong objectively verifiably wrong shit in here
[10:56:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> Come on
[10:56:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> That defeats the whole damn point of the channel
[10:56:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> "abstain from modding" gtfo -_-
[10:56:50] <saturn2> yeah, exactly
[10:56:50] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: "we can't" it's *not the job of the ops to make that call.*
[10:56:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> It is!
[10:56:59] <feep[work]> +q is not a truth-tracking skill.
[10:57:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> Of course it's the ops' job!
[10:57:05] <feep[work]> no!
[10:57:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes
[10:57:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's the only people whose job it could even possibly be
[10:57:24] <feep[work]> well, that's a bit of a fundamental disagreement :P
[10:57:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> There's literally no one else who could conceivably have that job
[10:57:38] <feep[work]> I don't think there are any people whose job it is, because I don't think it's good behavior period.
[10:57:58] <feep[work]> for comparison, there are no people whose job it is to set buildings on fire
[10:58:02] <feep[work]> because we do not want anyone to do that.
[10:58:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> It is absolutely good behavior to not permit the channel to degenerate into "people can just say objectively wrong shit that we know and can verify is wrong"
[10:58:46] <saturn2> i think we've had this disagreement for several years, and have never resolved it
[10:59:10] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: uh, I disagree completely.
[10:59:19] <feep[work]> because the *mechanism* to correct wrong shit is supposed to be debate and sources.
[10:59:27] <feep[work]> +o is not a mechanism that reliably corrects wrong shit.
[11:00:35] <feep[work]> +o is not a sword of truth, it cannot act as a sword of truth, so if you try to use it as a sword of truth, all you will get is bleeding.
[11:00:47] <feep[work]> "just put the right people in power" *never works*.
[11:01:22] <feep[work]> or rather, the right people are those who *don't* use power for *things that power cannot do*
[11:01:30] <feep[work]> arbitrating truth is *not a thing power can do.*
[11:01:45] <saturn2> obviously, my +q isn't evidence that i'm right, and wasn't intended to be
[11:01:52] <feep[work]> uh
[11:02:15] <feep[work]> like, I'm not saying it's evidence you're right, I'm saying +o making the channel less wrong *only works to the extent that you are right*
[11:02:29] <feep[work]> and you are right in this specific case, but you are not *systemically right*
[11:02:52] <feep[work]> ops are not a source of rightness.
[11:02:54] <saturn2> i'm confident enough about this to bet my reputation on it
[11:02:58] <feep[work]> that's not the point!
[11:03:11] <feep[work]> put a rawlsian veil of rightness on it
[11:03:14] <feep[work]> does rightness flow from +o?
[11:03:17] <feep[work]> I don't think it does.
[11:03:24] <feep[work]> so +o *does not work to create a gradient.*
[11:04:01] <feep[work]> and in fact leaves the place significantly worse off by *breaking* the existing mechanisms of becoming less wrong
[11:04:08] <feep[work]> which is sources.
[11:04:55] <feep[work]> as per the fucking sequences: >     There are a very few injunctions in the human art of rationality that have no ifs, ands, buts, or escape clauses. This is one of them. Bad argument gets counterargument. Does not get bullet. Never. Never ever never for ever.

[19:03:03] <dbohdan> It's pretty similar.  The big difference is that in Ukrainian it is easier to coin new feminine forms (it is more standardized and seems less weird).  So if you wanted to, you could have a feminine word for, say, "forum poster" or "system administrator".

[19:23:26] <gwern> elegant. nice use of woodblock style illustration. not sure I'd call it 'rubrication' because it's purely illustratory and doesn't highlight any text but definitely a notch above most video game covers
[19:24:19] <dbohdan> gwern: "not sure I'd call it 'rubrication'"  Right, I guess not
[19:25:58] <gwern> I tend to see rubrication as, broadly, using red to highlight semantic information - so I count rubricating text, like start of sentence in medieval manuscripts, or rubricating datapoints in a statistical graph, because those are encodings of quantitative or qualitative information; rubricating a rose image, well, it's information sure, but not really anything semantic. 'here's a rose. roses...
[19:26:04] <gwern> ...are vaguely involved, somehow'
[19:29:44] <dbohdan> I agree.  It mostly makes the rose the correct color.  While it is a kind of emphasis, it doesn't say a lot.

Set in England in 1930, the plot revolves around a nineteen-year-old woman named Jennifer, who becomes trapped in a world ruled by young girls who have established a class hierarchy called the Red Crayon Aristocrats. It was first released in 2006 by Sony Computer Entertainment in Japan. …)

[22:04:30] <ggreer> it's not like the water gets destroyed. the surface of this planet is more water than not water
[22:04:45] <gwern> yeah, it's pretty crazy. you don't think of semiconductor manufacturing as needing as much waer and electricity as it does
[22:04:56] <Ralith> presumably it ends up with additional stuff in it that limits its usefulness
[22:05:15] <ggreer> yeah but water that comes in has to be purified. tap water isn't exactly good for semiconductors
[22:05:18] <gwern> I've never seen an accounting of where all the water *goes*. does it really take that much input water to get out the atomically-pure distilled water that they need for all of the processes?

[22:05:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh! I almost forgot to mention one of the other highlights of my trip to Manhattan the other day.

[22:10:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Is 8-THC Legal?
[22:10:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> A: In short, yes! The 2018 Farm Bill confirms  all derivatives, isomers, and cannabinoids in hemp are legal , however, it set restrictions stating all final products must contain 0.3% (or less) ∆9-THC. The ∆8-THC products that contain hemp will always contain .3% or less ∆9-THC. Although there are no current age restrictions from the federal government on hemp derived products, the company policy for our CBD Kratom
[22:10:37] <Obormot\Arcturus>  stores is to sell to those 18 years of age or older. Federal regulations state inhalants can only be consumed by those who are 21 years of age and older in the United States, thus the ∆8-THC cartridges are an age-restricted product."
[22:10:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> So inhalants specifically are 21+
[22:11:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway I guess they didn't ask for ID because we were obviously over 21
