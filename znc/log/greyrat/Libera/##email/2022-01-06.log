[17:52:27] * jimpop What a drag it is *receiviing* DMARC reports
[17:53:26] <Khepra> I turned those off
[17:53:35] <Khepra> kicked all the RUFs to the curb
[17:54:05] <tuxick> did someone write a working parser for them by now?
[17:54:20] <tuxick> ideally sticking it in a db or something
[17:55:58] <minimal> tuxick: first search result: https://github.com/domainaware/parsedmarc
[17:57:16] <tuxick> does that include "working"?
[17:57:35] <tuxick> must admit, haven't looked at dmarc reports for ages now
[17:58:06] <tuxick> "oh, a zipped xml, bye"
[18:01:14] <minimal> that script seems to support outputting JSON or CSV
[18:05:36] <tuxick> both useful enough
[18:06:02] <tuxick> i'll keep it in mind, not managing much mail anymore
[18:06:32] <tuxick> customers all on outlook/o365
[18:06:49] <tuxick> since mail is considered rocket surgery 
[18:07:06] <tuxick> "you can't possibly know how to handle that"
[18:07:22] <minimal> unlike Microsoft with their 01/01/2022 Exchange issues? ;-)

[18:27:51] <tga> greetings
[18:29:23] <Khepra> o/
[18:29:33] <tga> Khepra: it looks like my provider's spam filter can verify gmail's dkim
[18:29:50] <tga> not spf obviously, but with dkim passing it doesn't complain
[18:29:54] <Khepra> tga: that's okay, meaning the DKIM fields weren't broken by the forwarder. in _this_ case.
[18:29:59] <tga> dkim=pass (2048-bit key) header.d=gmail.com
[18:30:29] <tga> so I should be able to set up a forwarder that doesn't break dkim, right?
[18:30:53] <Khepra> context for everyone else:  tga was asking which server to use for minimal MX/MTA functionality to forward one domain to another, and I tried to dissuade them from forwarding :)
[18:31:02] <tga> and I figure I can keep the registrar's mail forwarder as a lower priority mx, in case mine is down or something
[18:31:17] <Khepra> tga: depends which fields the sender introduced into dkim signing
[18:31:50] <tga> ah, right -- so I _am_ forwarding through my registrar atm, and don't know of any problems -- I was going to set up my own forwarder for aliases and a bit of extra privacy
[18:32:07] <Khepra> tga: there's another option I forgot to mention. You never said who your email provider was. if it's gmail, then gmail has pop3 fetch of external inboxes.
[18:32:13] *** Quits: derpadmin (~Anonymous@homebase.200013.net) (Quit: Lost terminal)
[18:32:41] <Khepra> so instead of forwarding, just accept mail; run postfix for that. and then have your actual email provider fetch that via imap (pop3 is dead, dunno why gmail insists)
[18:32:54] <tga> nah, mailbox.org
[18:33:41] <Khepra> seems like they can do this: https://kb.mailbox.org/display/MBOKBEN/How+to+integrate+external+e-mail+accounts
[18:34:09] <Khepra> this was just a quick google + cursory glance. check the docs or ask support if you can do this. this would be your BEST solution.
[18:34:12] <tga> right, but I can't set up a catchall, and I can't forward to random other addresses
[18:34:27] <tga> also they charge extra for 3/25/more aliases, which is annoying
[18:34:48] <tga> (probably still cheaper than my time debugging why my forwarder doesn't work the 100th time)
[18:35:49] <Khepra> why not set your "forwarding" domains' MX directly to mailbox.org's ?  If the  reason here is privacy, so you can hide the actual recipient domain, this would still do that.
[18:36:11] <Khepra> (but then yes, you'd have to setup those domains as hosted in your mailbox.org control panels or whatsit)
[18:37:12] <tga> that's what I was saying above, 1) I couldn't do evilspammer@tga.com -> (blacklist) -> tga@tga.com, which is the major thing I'd like to try
[18:37:47] <Khepra> perhaps find a decent mail hoster that can do that? :)
[18:37:51] <tga> 2) even without weird alias schemes, this is for multiple project domains where I want to forward a few addresses to people's actual email addresses
[18:38:12] <tga> I don't know if any of the major hosters do anything like that
[18:38:13] <Khepra> if they're on gmail, this is gonna be terrible for them
[18:38:19] <tga> spam?
[18:38:37] <Khepra> everything we talked about in #debian, from broken SPF through forwarding spam and getting your forwarded blacklisted by gmail
[18:39:11] <tga> right
[18:39:35] <tga> so far I'm not having problems with gmail recipients when forwarding through the registrar
[18:39:47] <tga> the blacklist otoh would suck
[18:40:15] <tga> I guess a lot of senders are also on gmail, so the dkim probably saves them from the spam box
[18:41:56] <tga> heh I just tried to send an email directly to my mailbox and it looks like my IP is in spamhaus
[18:43:07] <tga> outbound policy by my ISP, wonderful
[18:44:16] <tga> less spam vs fundamentally breaking the internet in favor of centralizing email to large corps
