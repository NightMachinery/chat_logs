[01:09:34] <J_Darnley> Specifically the equivalent of Windows' alt+0233 for e-acute
[01:09:38] <phogg> [[R]]: that also works but is less likely to trick people since it's used for closing any Windows window.

[03:26:48] <TheGuestMovie> Anyone here use Slack? A couple of FOSS projects say to use their Slack for support questions. I signed up to Slack, created an account, and I was able to join the 1st one, by logging in, Slack emails me a code, I enter it, and I join the channel. For the 2nd project, I never got prompted for a code, it just says "email or password invalid".

[06:29:12] <bruda> trafficjam: I think the best bet would probably be to research openstack and it's competitors to get a good picture of what you are looking at.
[06:29:19] <ananke> trafficjam: it's not an argument, it's a serious statement on the feasibility of such endeavour
[06:29:25] <keir> a question that excludes requirements, limitations, finances, current infrastructure
[06:29:29] <blackgatonegro>  Now about the software depends on the hardware, the company needs and what exactly you want to do with it.
[06:29:39] <keir> it's vague to the point of not really asking much

[07:03:42] <trafficjam> which is, generally speaking, the more modern software

[07:06:37] <trafficjam> ayecee: i imagine a lot of the guys in hardware have experience managing infrastructure no?
[07:06:45] <keir> to which i found a channel with 80 people in using that keyword
[07:06:51] <ayecee> trafficjam: i have no reason to think so
[07:07:13] <trafficjam> ayecee: so which active channels would you recommend instead?
[07:07:23] <keir> given a toaster is also hardware
[07:07:29] <jcbjoe2021> i think i know the answer to this but im gonna give it a shot. i have a vps and i ssh to it. (duh) my private key is the same for root and my regular user. should i change? or not worry about it since nobody knows where the vps is located?

[07:07:33] <trafficjam> #openstack and #cozycloud are dead it seems, not sure what other options there are

[07:07:43] <keir> trafficjam: dead how?
[07:07:45] <sebastorama> "hardware" as community usually means people that like doing custom embedded stuff, robotics, etc..
[07:07:51] <ayecee> trafficjam: but i would recommend to find a channel where people use openstack
[07:07:53] <trafficjam> keir: dead as in nobody is there
[07:08:01] <keir> trafficjam: there's 80 people in there
[07:08:18] <trafficjam> "there" as in active
[07:08:20] <ayecee> i would not expect any irc channel about cloud infrastructure to be described as "active".
[07:08:27] <ayecee> it's too niche for that.

[07:44:06] <keir> sounds like it could have done without the preamble
[07:44:17] <Disposeable-Nick>  Tcl quoting is both simple and annoying | I forgot how god awful the exec command in tcl is | you want to use list literal quoting using braces | Not double quote strings | use list literal around all the shell args | {'s/jdjajjdn//%'} etc... | https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/page/Dodekalogue | <<< Basically gives you a run-through of how insane tcl quoting is. | Firstly, exec produces that sort of error message when the pipeline it runs exits
[07:44:17] <Disposeable-Nick> with a non-zero exit-code without writing to stderr. Secondly, grep has an exit-code of 1 when it doesn't find anything. These two features don't sit very well together! | Okay guys, so with all that information out there, how do I fix this to exec properly, as it works fine- by shell, but when exec'd through an eggdrop TCL script, it obviously does not work fine.  So, I want to fix this: exec inxi -b | grep "Distro:\|Type:" | sed

[11:04:16] <pnbeast> If you're averse to learning an editor with more features, nano will be fine.  (for the sorts of things you'd likely be doing as root, e.g. editing simple config files in simple ways)
[11:04:35] <Sauvin> What pnbeast said.
[11:04:54] <itdepends> ne is pretty much a modern graphical editor but stuck in a terminal and looks like a dos application. It will play nicely with sudo.

[17:15:59] <koollman> Psi-Jack: sure. but that's true for any FS option, too :)
[17:16:05] <phogg> ckie: to address your original question: I don't know, but it sounds like it would just be a "grow zfs left" scenario. If ZFS supports that then you can likely do it.
[17:16:48] <PaulFertser> phogg: I wrote https://termbin.com/wfhe + https://termbin.com/m42w etc for work to be executed by an ARM embedded system recently. Didn't enjoy the experience at all. Is it really my lack of shell programming experience or is it probably that shell is really a tool that's hard to enjoy working with?
[17:16:49] <Psi-Jack> Basically to go ZFS from ext4, reinstall.

[17:18:32] <phogg> PaulFertser: likely a bit of both. It's easy not to enjoy working at the shell level. If you need anything that requires complex data structures it's a nightmare.
[17:19:16] <rcf> phogg: reliability is an issue if you expect the full set of features, though as long as you stay within what is actually tested btrfs is fine.
[17:19:29] <PaulFertser> phogg: no complex structures there I'd say. I shared the code to give a specific example of a real life task.

[18:24:50] <FreeBDSM> hello, I have some questions regarding some basic dirs with binaries. `ls -lash /bin/Mail` tells me it's a symlink pointing to `../../bin/mailx`. Afaiu, this should be broken path, since `../` relative to `/bin/` is `/` and thus `../../` should be something "above" root dir, which is an error (IMO), but `realpath /bin/Mail` returns `/usr/bin/mailx`, which is even weirder, because I could understand if `/../../../../` would be equal to just `/`, since
[18:24:51] <FreeBDSM> that's the topmost level in fs tree already, and then the path should be /bin/mailx, which is not a symlink. Why is it so?

[21:49:42] <phogg> TJ-: you could set -e before the curl then set +e after, but there would be no way to disable it before grep runs

[23:33:12] <TJ-> acidtonic: according to "man 7 buildbot-worker" in its section about "sysvinit" it uses WORKER_* ... I'd expect things like hostnames to passed as command-line options via WORKER_OPTIONS

[23:48:53] <pikapika> dd cloning a partition to a new partition on the same laptop seems to work
[23:49:00] <ayecee> pikapika: safe as moving the original hard disk to a new computer
[23:49:10] <pikapika> ayecee, and how safe is that?
[23:49:18] <ayecee> pretty safe
[23:49:28] <[[R]]> ayecee: that doesnt sound like a confident answer
[23:49:45] <ayecee> well i'm just thinking about the ways a gifted person could cock it up
[23:50:09] <TJ-> pikapika: dd clone on the same system, you'd need to alter the file-system label and uuid of either the clone or the original
[23:50:14] <pikapika> I was recommended clonezilla here and it seems to do a dd but also saves up some more metadata
