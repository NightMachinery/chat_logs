[03:26:20] <emanuele6> oh, that is the problem?
[03:26:33] <emanuele6> you are not really doing what i meant
[03:26:38] <emanuele6> but you can do it simpler i think
[03:26:42] <emanuele6> give me a sec
[03:36:20] <emanuele6> mm

[03:37:04] <seninha> kinda convoluted, but does what I want

[03:55:25] <emanuele6> this is hard D:
[03:55:53] <emanuele6> i am trying to do it without hold space and regexes are very hard to get right
[03:57:16] <Riviera> phew
[03:57:27] <Riviera> that's a scarily long description :)
[03:59:26] <seninha> damn, structural regexps could sove that smoothly...
[03:59:59] <seninha> Why aren't we on the timeline that plan9 succeeded?
[04:00:34] <Riviera> i'd be surprised if anybody forced you to use sed :)
[04:04:13] <Riviera> so
[04:04:13] <emanuele6> omg, i just figured out my stupid mistake lol

[04:04:20] <Riviera> like this?
[04:04:30] <Riviera> [absolutely first try, absolutely untested]
[04:04:31] <emanuele6> i was adding to the start of the pattern space
[04:04:36] <emanuele6> instead of to the end
[04:06:22] <emanuele6> yes!!!
[04:06:28] <emanuele6> http://0x0.st/-CRq.sh
[04:06:31] <emanuele6> i've done it!
[04:06:45] <emanuele6> hehe
[04:07:06] <emanuele6> without hold space B)
[04:07:33] <Riviera> hm
[04:07:34] <Riviera> complains here
[04:07:37] <Riviera> works in GNU sed
[04:08:02] <emanuele6> oh
[04:08:07] <emanuele6> probably [^\n]
[04:08:22] <emanuele6> i could not figure out how to do it portably
[04:08:36] <Riviera> hm
[04:08:40] <Riviera> iirc \n is posix
[04:08:48] <Riviera> it does not work in ancient versions of sed,
[04:08:53] <Riviera> where people resorted to hacks like
[04:09:30] <Riviera> well, let me look it up
[04:10:26] <Riviera> [ -~]
[04:11:04] <Riviera> i actually thought it was more narrow
[04:11:32] <Riviera> but this was often used merely for \n (or, non-\n, that is0
[04:11:33] <Riviera> )
[04:11:42] <seninha> Riviera: tried yours solution, but got an infinite loop: https://0x0.st/-CRA.sh
[04:12:01] <Riviera> let me see
[04:12:10] <emanuele6> well, i could try to use a different delimiter i guess
[04:12:22] <Riviera> ah
[04:12:51] <emanuele6> # <<< 'asda, masda, pasda(3) - casda lasda, fasda' sed -n -e 's/ *\((.*)\) - \(.*\)$/,\'$'\n''\1 \2/' -e :a -e '/^\([^, ]*\), *\(.*\)\'$'\n''\([^\n]*\)$/ { s//\2\'$'\n''\1 \3\'$'\n''\3/; b a ;}' -e 's/^[[:space:]]\{1,\}//' -e 's/\'$'\n''[^\n]*$//' -e p
[04:12:52] <shbot> emanuele6: asda (3) casda lasda, fasda
[04:12:52] <shbot> emanuele6: masda (3) casda lasda, fasda
[04:12:52] <shbot> emanuele6: pasda (3) casda lasda, fasda
[04:12:58] <emanuele6> here is mine for now though
[04:13:15] <Riviera> seninha: i guess i know why, let me see
[04:13:37] <Riviera> seninha: btw, better use emanuele6's; i just hacked mine down without much care for edge cases and without much testing
[04:13:38] <seninha> thanks you two!
[04:13:57] <Riviera> but let me at least see about the loop, it's probably because of the s///-state for the t command
[04:14:24] <emanuele6> mine was mostly a challenge to not use hold space, with hold space it should be much simpler
[04:14:32] <Riviera> yup
[04:14:44] <Riviera> am too lazy to try that at the moment
[04:14:54] <Riviera> otherwise it migth be fun to compare approaches
[04:16:17] <Riviera> seninha: ah, it's actually a bigger bug than that
[04:16:53] <Riviera> mh
[04:17:09] <Riviera> seninha: sorry, too lazy right now to fix that :)

[04:18:30] <seninha> np
[04:19:07] <Tach> HI guys is it possible to sed for this string even when it has slashes in it without escaping them ? sed -n '/7vPwn9/2rX7qnSUlsePJ+p80ku3j1AGQA78i5FW2NFg=/{n; p}'
[04:20:06] <Riviera> Tach: you can use a different delimiter
[04:20:28] <Tach> Riviera will it be safe for 64base encodes strings ?
[04:21:16] <Riviera> Tach: sure, if you choose a character that does not occur in base64 encoded strings :)
[04:21:24] <Riviera> like spaces

[04:22:59] <Riviera> or perhaps underscores
[04:23:05] <Riviera> well, you get the idea ;)
[04:23:10] <Riviera> s/;/:/
[04:23:21] <Tach> Riviera thanks! indeed I saw underscores in the past :)
[04:27:59] <emanuele6> programming is sed is so hard lol
[04:28:39] <emanuele6> mostly because regexes with newlines become unreadable really quick
[04:30:54] <Riviera> mh
[04:31:36] <seninha> I'm now reading the manpage of ssam (plan 9's sed) to see if I can have a nicer (and faster) solution to my problem
[04:33:34] <seninha> Riviera, emanuele6: thank you for dedicating time to my problem
[04:33:54] <Riviera> no worries :)
[04:40:30] <emanuele6> seninha: does my solution also give you an infinite loop?
[04:41:37] <seninha> nope, but it does not work on my sed :P
[04:41:42] <seninha> had to install gnu sed
[04:41:47] <seninha> but it works
[04:41:50] <emanuele6> man
[04:42:43] <emanuele6> probably you can make it work if you use something like (( as delimiter
[04:42:45] <emanuele6> let me try
[04:43:34] <emanuele6> no, that won't work
[04:43:42] <emanuele6> ah, tab, right!
[04:43:50] <emanuele6> literal tabs are legal in []
[04:48:14] <emanuele6> yep, it works
[04:49:48] <emanuele6> seninha: http://0x0.st/-CRV.txt can you check if it works?
[04:52:14] <emanuele6> make sure to not expand the tabs, they must be literal tabs
[04:52:51] <Riviera> but why not the ((
[04:52:54] <Riviera> or ,, even
[04:53:08] <Riviera> asking seninha if there might be empty fields
[04:53:11] <emanuele6> because i can't negate ((
[04:53:23] <Riviera> i believe you wouldn't need to
[04:53:44] <seninha> emanuele6: nope ;-; https://0x0.st/-CRy.png
[04:54:42] <emanuele6> huh? it doesn't like \<newline> in y/// ?
[04:54:54] <emanuele6> try s///g maybe
[04:55:13] <Riviera> seninha: can there be empty fields?
[04:55:17] <Riviera> seninha: like
[04:55:25] <Riviera> seninha: asda, masda,, pasda
[04:55:28] <seninha> nope
[04:55:33] <Riviera> ok
[04:55:53] <seninha> The input is the output of `apropos .`

[04:59:32] <emanuele6> ok, i think plan9port's sed is not a fully featured sed
[04:59:47] <emanuele6> if i try to use y///, it tells me command not found
[04:59:57] <seninha> heh
[05:05:46] <emanuele6> oh, maybe `b a' is the issue actually
[05:05:59] <emanuele6> iirc POSIX only mandates `ba'
[05:06:09] <emanuele6> does this work? http://0x0.st/-CRw.txt
[05:06:14] <seninha> no, that's not a problem on BSD sed
[05:06:20] <seninha> I can use "b a" normally
[05:07:27] <seninha> yeah, it works!
[05:07:31] <emanuele6> oh, wait, i can test BSD sed on sdf now that i think about it
[05:07:35] <emanuele6> oh, cool
[05:07:39] <seninha> thanks!
[05:07:53] <emanuele6> i wonder what made it work now

[05:12:32] <emanuele6> after r/w/b/t/: etc posix mandates a newline instead of a ;

[05:13:15] <emanuele6> i was using    `b a ;}' before
[05:13:25] <emanuele6> that was the issue
