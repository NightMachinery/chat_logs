[01:44:23] <mickey8> hi all, i have something like this: select class,avg(t2.metric) from t1 left join t2 on t1.id=t2.id where class not null group by class; but i want to only avg() the t2.metric of unique t2 rows that were joined, how would i go about doing that?
[01:45:12] <thumbs> mickey8: what version of MySQL?
[01:45:30] <mickey8> 8 something
[01:45:53] <thumbs> mickey8: then use a CTE to generate the unique tuples, and join it
[01:45:59] <mickey8> but if there's multiple ways of doing it, i prefer the most general sql solution
[01:46:20] <mickey8> s/most/more
[01:46:31] <thumbs> a CTE is a general solution.
[01:46:40] <mickey8> alright. thanks
[01:47:46] <thumbs> WITH CTE AS (SELECT DISTINCT id, metric FROM t2) SELECT class, AVG(CTE.metric) FROM t1 JOIN CTE ON t1.id = CTE.id GROUP BY class
[01:48:09] <thumbs> that isn't the final answer, mind
[01:48:40] <thumbs> if you have repeating metric values, then use SELECT MAX(id) AS id, metric FROM t2 GROUP BY metric
[01:49:51] <mickey8> i might be misunderstanding, but your first line doesn't make sense to me. there are no duplicate rows in t2, the duplication comes from the join
[01:50:39] <thumbs> mickey8: so you have duplication in t2.id because of the 1->n relation?
[01:50:50] <mickey8> yeah
[01:51:00] <thumbs> mickey8: and different metric values?
[01:51:22] <mickey8> well, no, but that question makes me think i wasn't clear to begin with
[01:51:33] <thumbs> you were not.
[01:51:54] <thumbs> the MAX() solution would reduce the set accordingly, but you have to be careful
[01:52:20] *** Quits: palasso (~palasso@user/palasso) (Remote host closed the connection)
[01:53:01] *** Parts: kline (~freedom0@libera/staff/kline) (*.bannana *.split)
[01:53:16] <mickey8> t2 is a list of users, so there's one user per row, with a numeric metric. it has no duplicates. t1 has data obviously, and every row in t1 is linked to one row in t2, by their ids, or 1->n like you said (one t2 can be linked to multiple t1 rows)
[01:53:28] *** Joins: palasso (~palasso@user/palasso)
[01:53:59] <mickey8> when i join like i mentioned, i have t1 rows, but then the users from t2 appear multiple times, because some users has multiple data in t1
[01:54:17] <mickey8> then my avg() counts the metric of the same user(s) multiple times, which is what im trying to avoid
[01:55:11] <thumbs> in your initial example, t2 had a metric. Now t2 is a user.
[01:56:16] <thumbs> so presumably class is an attribute of a user.
[01:56:19] <mickey8> each user has a metric. i don't see the problem?
[01:56:29] <thumbs> ok, that is odd, but fine
[01:56:55] <mickey8> call it whatever makes you feel more comfortable, a grade, score, age
[01:56:57] <thumbs> the idea is to use the MAX() recipe on the table with the duplication of ids, and wrap it in a CTE
[01:57:33] <thumbs> the question is - if you have more than one row for the same value of id, which row attribute should be counted?
[01:58:11] <mickey8> if i understand your question correctly, then it doesn't matter, because a user has one metric which would be same across the lines
[01:58:54] <thumbs> mickey8: we need to know what a class is here, and the possible values
[02:00:42] <mickey8> sure, let's take twitter. t1 is tweets and t2 is users. t1.author is the author's id, and t2.id is the users's id. t1.class is an 0 or 1 just for the sake of simplicity. t2.amtoftweets is an integer.
[02:01:16] <mickey8> the point is to get the average amtoftweets of all users who have one or more tweets that have a class of 0, and then the same for those with 1
[02:02:32] <mickey8> but, again, a user shouldnt be counted more than once for each average. it would count one time at most when calculating the average regarding tweets of class 0, and once at most for those with class 1
[02:02:45] <mickey8> am i making more sense now?
[02:03:10] <thumbs> yes, that is better
[02:10:09] <thumbs> let me show you in a fiddle
[02:16:36] <thumbs> https://dbfiddle.uk/?rdbms=mysql_8.0&fiddle=339b8c934235c7b1805418fd3d7b8c67
[02:18:48] <thumbs> so you can see the results of the set first, and how we extract the average. Joining the users table isn't necessary.

[02:21:31] <mickey8> thanks
[02:25:23] <mickey8> you did ignore the fact that the amtoftweets is not a count(*), but a column in the users table
[02:26:17] <thumbs> counting the rows in the tweet table achieves the same result.
[02:26:19] <mickey8> but i get the idea, i'll make it work.
[02:27:28] <thumbs> if you store the number of tweets for each user, that is fine, but you won't be able to distinguish the class of each one in the total
[02:29:32] <thumbs> feel free to change the fiddle to adjust your test case and show us either way
[02:33:45] <thumbs> you have to consider the class of the tweet to count properly. Once you have the correct count, you can average the value.

[12:41:27] <podeni> Hi everyone. I have a column where I want to store unix timestamps (in seconds), and some of them exceed the maximum INT value. Should I switch to BIGINT or VARCHAR?
[12:43:53] <Naktibalda> do they exceed max int because they go beyond 2038?
[12:44:10] <podeni> Yes.
[12:44:13] <Naktibalda> just use TIMESTAMP instead
[12:45:31] <podeni> How's the storage requirement for that? I picked int because that seemed like it would occupy the least space.
[12:46:41] <Naktibalda> the same as BIGINT - https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/storage-requirements.html
[12:46:57] <Naktibalda> sorry, I meant DATETIME, don't use TIMESTAMP :)
[12:53:50] <podeni> Thanks. I think I'll go for DATETIME, with an INT -> BIGINT temporary solution until I can take the system offline for longer to convert INT -> DATETIME.
[13:05:20] <Vacuity> podeni: if year 2106 is enough, you could use INT UNSIGNED, which should be able to store up to 4.294.967.295 as a value

[21:18:27] <Junxter> this channel apparently expects people to be constantly connected.  You get banned if you close your computer and reconnect, even once a day.  No wonder this channel has barely any people.

[21:21:33] <Junxter> i have screenshots of private dialog with channel op
[21:22:15] <Junxter> this channel has 211 people, postgres has over 800.. wonder why ?
[21:22:50] <mmlj4> hey guys, I have this:   SELECT quantity * freightperunit AS freight FROM item WHERE confirmation_id = 12;    I want a grand total, which is obviously obtainable by adding them up in my script. Can SQL simply give me the total? thanks
[21:23:02] <Junxter> because people in thos channel get put on a ban list and auto-redirected to an overflow channel, just because the disconnect from this channel from time to time, i.e. even once a day
[21:23:33] <Junxter> #mysql used to be a very popular channel
[21:23:40] <Junxter> now #mysql is almost silent
[21:23:44] <Naktibalda> Junxter: probably you get redirected to overflow channel if your client is not authenticated when it rejoins
[21:24:18] <Junxter> I am on 20 channels, I don't have a problem with rejoin / network.
[21:25:08] <mmlj4> a subselect, maybe?
[21:25:13] <Naktibalda> that problem disappeared to me since I enabled Connect with SASL option in my IRC client configuration
[21:25:14] <Junxter> Naktibalda, just compare how many people are in this channel vs other sql related channels.  Weird things are happening here silently pushing people away.
[21:26:10] <Junxter> No, I literally had channel op private messaging me telling me I was manually banned because I was disconnecting "every day".
[21:26:13] <Naktibalda> mmlj4: SELECT SUM(quantity * freighperunit)
[21:26:39] <mmlj4> oh, thanks
[21:26:42] <Naktibalda> I disconnect 5 times a day and I see many other people disconnecting too
[21:27:07] <Junxter> just compare user count ... the ban policy of this channel is unique, and very restrictive.
[21:27:43] <Junxter> I've never had ban issues with any other channels I participate, only #mysql recently
[21:28:07] <Junxter> many others probably got silently banned, and you don't see that

[22:10:48] <Xgc> Junxter: Typically, that can happen if your client flaps about due to network problems.  Once a day will never get you bounced.  I've never seen it.
[22:12:57] <Xgc> Junxter: I get asked to clear a ban or two maybe once every couple of weeks.  Not very often.
[22:14:13] <Xgc> Junxter: I don't track user connections.  So I can't really tell what your client was doing.

[22:16:52] <dlam> if i 'SET GLOBAL' a system variable, does it work immediatley?  (or do i have to restart mysql?)
[22:18:37] <Xgc> dlam: Not all are dynamically settable.  Some require restart.  Usually, that's documented.
[22:19:21] <dlam> ah!  thx thx   (i'm trying to change:  innodb_ft_min_token_size)
[22:19:45] <jkavalik> and it does not work for already running connections/sessions (including yours)
[22:19:54] <jkavalik> (if it is session specific at least
[22:22:11] <dlam> aight it said " Variable 'innodb_ft_min_token_size' is a read only variable"  ...so i guess i gotta restart mysql!
