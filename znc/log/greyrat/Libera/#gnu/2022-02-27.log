[07:49:25] <isf> yes! :D
[07:56:52] <Ribby> I was also trying to donate to PureOS, but it requires an account? Same for Debian, but I somehow have difficulties with that one.
[07:58:28] <Ribby> Ironic that I would be spreading the donation. I could have go for one, but I can't ignore the help provided by the community. :)
[08:01:24] <isf> oh hehe
[08:01:36] <isf> i dont know how donate for PureOS
[08:01:43] <isf> i recommend you send a mail to them
[08:01:55] <Ribby> That reminds me.
[08:01:59] <isf> i dont have the mail of them, but maybe with a little search you can find it
[08:04:01] <Ribby> Before I went off to charity. I had to check up with Google Transparency Report, https://www.virustotal.com/ (not a virus, but if you aren't sure, you can do your own research), and Better Business Bureau.
[08:06:15] <isf> can i recommend you 
[08:06:28] <isf> where you can give money only if you want in voluntary way?
[08:07:05] <isf> i recommend you help to Trisquel too
[08:07:22] <isf> a lof of free software activists use that distro :D
[08:07:36] <Ribby> I found out some the bbb, that purism, the developer of PureOS, got bad reviews. Reviews usually go for the delays in producing hardware. What really alarms me is that the page says only 1 person is in the company? It sounds like a dangerous combination for the development of PureOS.
[08:07:54] <Ribby> *opps mistake, sorry.
[08:08:14] <isf> that is interesting point of view
[08:09:31] <Ribby> I am kind of concerned that such a starting promise will falter dormant, then fall into defunct resignation.
[08:10:55] <Ribby> Good thing about it, is it's a small sized and live boot Debian-based Debian. It has its share of GNU problems, but so far, okay.

[08:13:27] <isf> :o
[08:15:02] <Ribby> I was about to make comparison between apples and oranges. Maybe gone theatrical with a question with a booming genie voice like, "What is Trisquel, compared to the likes of PureOS/Debian?"

[08:16:29] <Ribby> It's bias, it's condescending, but I can't say otherwise.
[08:17:47] <isf> what mean bias?
[08:18:39] <Ribby> I guess it was a personal preference over ubuntu-based os designs.
[08:19:36] <Ribby> I didn't check if ubuntu did have different desktop environments, etc. I'm sure it has a few by default.

[08:20:43] <Ribby> The matter of first impression could be influential in shaping the outlook of future products.
[08:21:07] <isf> a example of that
[08:21:18] <isf> is trisquel now are leaving the support to the 32bits
[08:21:27] <isf> becouse is based in ubuntu
[08:21:46] <Ribby> I don't want to exasperate, but OMG!!!
[08:21:52] <isf> sadlym but interesting if you see where you can put your help in terms of money for example if you arent a technical user
[08:22:43] <isf> i see someones inviting people to help to extend the support to trisquel 9 but looks like right now nothing is happening
[08:22:58] <isf> in anycase, trisquel 9 have support to 32 bits to the 2023
[08:23:34] <Ribby> I also read that Richard Stallman had criticizied about Ubuntu so anything ubuntu is technically bad?
[08:23:52] <isf> nah, technical issues arent important realy
[08:24:11] <Ribby> okay.
[08:24:17] <isf> in the point of view of RMS ubuntu is bad in terms of free software
[08:24:33] <isf> becouse ubuntu, share, recommend, and support, and install nonfree software always
[08:24:42] <isf> so, they dont respect the users freedoms
[08:25:24] <Ribby> Could have mentioned the drop of 32 bit.
[08:25:47] <Ribby> So what happens after the year 2023?
[08:26:16] <isf> trisquel go to leave the support of it
[08:26:38] <isf> and looks like the only option to the 32 bits in free distros looks like install parabola
[08:26:40] <isf> or nothing haha
[08:27:01] <isf> or install trisquel withot support or security updates
[08:27:19] <isf> but that must be without internet connection
[08:27:32] <Ribby> It's almost like following ubuntu.
[08:27:39] <Noisytoot> Which architecture?
[08:27:48] <Noisytoot> Many architectures have 32-bit versions
[08:30:04] <Ribby> I tried Parabola, it works. I don't know if it's me, but there's something funky about the colors of the screen and/or taskbar.
[08:30:37] <Ribby> Oh, it works in terms of live boot.
[08:31:31] <isf> yes i try it too but as dont have a guided instalation
[08:31:35] <isf> is hard to the new users
[08:31:49] <Ribby> I think I was trying to get the installation going from the live boot, but plenty of networks were going down.
