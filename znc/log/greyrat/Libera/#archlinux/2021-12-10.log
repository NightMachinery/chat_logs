[00:56:21] <Spawns_Carpeting> Hello. It's been around a year since I've installed arch and it seems some stuff has changed. Before installing the kernel only required running the normal pacman command, and the kernel was placed into /boot, now that does not seem to be the case. Where is it putting the kernel at?

[00:57:20] <kevr> yeah, exactly

[05:04:55] <rawktucc> Hi there. I realize this is a stupid question, but how come the config for arch's apache2 differs so much from debians? On debian, it's /etc/apache2 and /var/www, on arch it's /etc/httpd. and /etc/httpd is very sparse compared to arch's httpd
[05:05:12] <rawktucc> my question is more how come the organizational structure is so much different? which is more correct here?

[05:05:23] <thrice> fireion: gdm's config?  I think if you force gdm to use X, gnome will always use X
[05:05:30] <thrice> (might be wrong)
[05:05:30] <MacGyver> So what you're trying is to keep one X session active, and log in at the same time on another user in a different X session?
[05:05:44] <fireion> MacGyver, yes exactly.
[05:05:57] <ectospasm> rawktucc: Debian has a very Debian way of doing things.
[05:06:23] <ectospasm> On Red Hat based systems, Apache2 stuff is in /etc/httpd, the binary is even called "httpd"
[05:06:32] <ectospasm> so Arch follows that standard, it seems
[05:06:58] <thrice> fireion: try editing /etc/gdm/custom.conf, uncomment the wayland line, and restart gdm?
[05:06:58] <ectospasm> "httpd" is rather generic
[05:06:59] <fireion> Fedora wiki talks about it https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/configuring-xorg-as-default-gnome-session/
[05:07:00] <phrik> Title: Configuring Xorg as the default GNOME session :: Fedora Docs (at docs.fedoraproject.org)
[05:07:07] <MacGyver> I'm ... not too sure this is possible at all from GDM without switching TTY.
[05:07:23] <MacGyver> And that might be the reason it then uses wayland instead?

[05:09:08] <fireion> Here's the proof: nvidia-smi showing 2 xorg processes: http://ix.io/3HxC
[05:09:17] <ectospasm> I haven't used apache2 in ages.  I've settled on nginx myself.
[05:09:24] <fireion> thrice, I already have WaylandEnable=False uncommented.
[05:09:25] <ectospasm> Good thing too, we use it at work.
[05:09:25] <thurstylark> rawktucc: debian has a configuration paradigm that they will patch into whatever software they're packaging. Arch follows upstream's paradigm and ships the config from upstream, which is usually laden with examples and documentation
[05:09:38] <rawktucc> this is a learning curve then

[05:36:34] <rawktucc> yes, I did like that. got really used to it

[05:36:57] <rawktucc> should I be using nginx? that's another entirely different learning curve
[05:37:16] <ectospasm> You'd probably just want to have an Include that includes everything in /etc/httpd/sites-enabled/*, and make symlinks to /etc/httpd/sites-available/
[05:37:27] <ectospasm> If you wanted to do it that way
[05:37:30] <ectospasm> You don't have to
[05:37:40] <ectospasm> But Arch is geared for doing it the way you want.
[05:37:50] <ectospasm> As long as you understand it, no one will stop you.
[05:37:54] <rawktucc> seems like maybe I should learn nginx instead
[05:38:01] <rawktucc> if i have to unlearn debian apache to use arch apache...

[07:47:09] <Nitrousoxide> I'm trying to repo-add yay to my archiso but I keep getting the same error: `___ does not have a valid database archive extension.` I've tried the yay_11.0.2_x86_64.tar.gz archive and the source.tar.gz archive from https://github.com/Jguer/yay/releases but neither seem to work.
[07:48:31] <thurstylark> that's not what those archives are built for, and that's definitely not the way to go about installing a package
[07:48:44] <thurstylark> is your goal just to install yay?

[14:10:19] <Cilinder> It's probably a basic question but I couldn't find the answer (I did search I swear), why does it say "iwctl command not found" after installing and booting? iwctl is there in the install environment if thats how you call it, but after installing and booting without the usb it's gone, how do I connect to wifi without it?
[14:10:58] <thurstylark> pacstrap will only install packages that you specify

[14:20:45] <lmoe> Hey there! Usually I can solve things by googleing but I'm out of ideas now and require some help. The longer my system is running, the slower it gets. Mostly when starting applications. For example Nemo and Alacritty starts immediately at the beginning. The longer the machine runs, it takes up to 10 seconds. This behavior is basically for any application. My specs are fine 3900x/32GB memory and
[14:20:48] <lmoe> a nvme SSD. No swap enabled. Does someone have an idea how to investigate this properly? :) 
[14:21:29] <thurstylark> if one of those purposes is to run on hardware that doesn't have wifi, or any networking at all, then installing network management utils isn't productive beyond an argument that the user might expect it to be there. The whole point is to make as few assumptions about the user and their motivations as possible so Arch can also serve users that have conflicting motivations
[14:23:25] <post-factum> lmoe: what's the memory usage?
[14:23:52] <post-factum> lmoe: also have you tried to strace apps to see where the delay may occur?
[14:24:34] <post-factum> lmoe: is it the same for console apps (like, simple `ls`), or gui only?

I haven't tried strace and I don't know for sure if it's console apps as well. I actually think it could be GUI apps only now that you're asking. Potentially an xorg issue? I'm using AwesomeWM with some copycat theme.

[23:55:28] <tarma> Hello. I am using a Thinkpad X13 (Gen 1 AMD). I'm trying to make bluetooth default to being OFF when I boot. But if I turn bluetooth off via GNOME's settings dropdown, it will turn itself back on next reboot. I'm using tlp and I tried setting `DEVICES_TO_DISABLE_ON_STARTUP="bluetooth"`, but that actualy *disables* the bluetooth device, and then
[23:55:29] <tarma> GNOME can't even turn it back on. I've also enabled/disabled systemd-rfkill, but that doesn't seem to do anything, and from my understanding it would only enable/disable the device, not simply turn it off. Any ideas?
[23:56:28] <bf_> sounds like a case for gnome-config default setting?
