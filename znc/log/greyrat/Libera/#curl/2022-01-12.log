[13:33:04] <bagder> "New defects found: 0"
[13:33:18] <zelest> Universe: Hold my beer!
[13:34:00] <bagder> well, these days the static code analyzers rarely find anything noteworthy
[13:34:47] <bagder> I think most sec flaws are now found by people making special fuzzers or when they just randomly fall over something odd
[13:34:54] <gevaerts> We need dynamic code analyzers! The static once are not moving fast enough!
[13:35:28] <bagder> let me try a question on you, with a sec angle
[13:35:53] <bagder> there's an API that in the docs says it accepts a 'long' (vararg)
[13:36:25] <bagder> if you pass a larger value than long (like passing it on unsigned), you can trigger something bad
[13:36:46] <bagder> since it isn't following the docs then, is it then a sec problem or just an app problem?
[13:38:33] <bagder> the vararg thing makes the compiler just silently accept it...
[13:41:49] <gevaerts> Can I pick option (3), a compiler problem? :)
[13:42:19] <bagder> well, that would perhaps then say that it isn't a sec problem... =)
[13:42:28] <bagder> in the API I mean
[13:42:34] <Piru> I wish __attribute__ format and format_arg would have been somehow generalized
[13:43:30] <Piru> nowe it's hardwired to printf-like format string vs matching args only
[13:44:01] <Piru> had they somehow expanded on the idea and made it configurable it could have been used here
[13:44:09] <gevaerts> It's a tricky one. *technically* it's API misuse and on the same level as people passing 1 instead of 0 to a call, but there's no warning, it's not easy to spot, and many people aren't aware of the problem
[13:44:58] <bagder> right, I don't want to "hide" it, but I also don't like to "cry wolf" about an issue
[13:46:42] <bagder> I'm leaning towards NOT a sec issue
[13:46:56] <bagder> still a bug of course
[13:50:43] <bagder> btw https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-22947
[13:50:51] <bagder> calls it "Open Source Curl Remote Code Execution Vulnerability" ...

[13:57:49] *** Quits: Jaxx (~Jaxx@user/jaxx) (Remote host closed the connection)
[13:58:24] <bagder> but apparently they've fixed their curl and that's good

[14:00:15] <Piru> would not count that a security issue
[14:00:23] <Piru> the vararg thing
[14:00:30] <bagder> right, thanks
[14:01:40] <Piru> if some application has security impact due to flaw like that, it's issue in that particular app itself.
[14:01:53] <Piru> that's how I would rationalize it
[14:02:10] *** Quits: uid_max (~samw@host81-159-60-189.range81-159.btcentralplus.com) (Quit: Leaving)
[14:02:14] <Piru> that being said, anythign that helps developer from falling into traps like that would be nice to have
[14:02:30] <icing> +1 to what Piru said
[14:02:43] <Piru> varargs being easy to trip on is a known fact in C. not much can be done about it
[14:02:48] <bagder> Piru: right, the function *should* return an error in this case instead of going boom
[14:03:11] <Piru> technically thast'
[14:03:15] <Piru> that's not possible
[14:03:29] <Piru> limitation of C and varargs
[14:03:45] <bagder> well, negative value for a 'long' set to be a size could be an indication =)
[14:04:05] <Piru> well that only catches some values
[14:04:11] <bagder> yeah, I only meant that
[14:12:40] <bagder> let's see what the reporter says about it
[14:15:39] *** Joins: uid_max (~samw@host81-159-60-189.range81-159.btcentralplus.com)
[14:19:04] <Piru> the only way to "fix" this would be the have a completely new ABI for varargs
[14:19:33] <Piru> wehre you'd need to introduce the parameter types somehow
[14:19:52] <Piru> type, param, type2, param2, ..., typen, paramn
[14:20:00] <bagder> this report is for curl_formadd(), which is an API we deprecated four years ago, partly because of the heavy use of varargs there
[14:20:27] <Piru> but even that wouldn't work necessarily..
[14:21:00] <Piru> where*
[14:22:58] <Piru> heh ok, kind of stretching it

[16:12:59] <bagder> I get the sense the reporter doesn't agree a 100% with me on this...
[16:13:31] <Piru> break some iot device and no one bats an eye, b0rk microsoft thing and everyone loses their mind
[16:16:41] <Piru> bagder: it's only human to feel disappointed and try to defend your stance. but unless some new information comes along fromt hat description it clearly sounds like non-issue, or at least not an issue in libcurl
[16:16:52] <Piru> from that*
[16:17:34] <bagder> yeah, I totally understand that actually
[16:17:47] <bagder> this person has also put a lot of effort into the report and reproducing example code etc
[16:18:04] <Piru> I've been around the block myself enough to have had my supposedly great findings shot down from orbit (only way to be sure). It does sting
[16:19:22] <Piru> sometimes the argument is just wrong, but then typically you have a fairly decent counter argument you can present. if you can't offer one, that should be kind of a hint :>
[16:20:09] <bagder> very true
[16:24:31] *** Joins: martiert (~martiert@ti0185q160-2775.bb.online.no)
[16:26:01] <Piru> I guess this *could* be considered if there was bunch (and I mean several) of existing libcurl using apps that would be vulnerable because of this. then at least you could argue that it's actually happening a lot in real life
[16:27:02] <Piru> but I doubt the reporter can show this
[16:29:27] <Piru> analogy: malloc() can't know if your app has math overlfowing size_t passed to it and thus you allocate too little memory. there is very little malloc() can do to defend against it.
[16:30:47] <Piru> so if such math overflow exists it can easily lead to a vulnerability. but is it a vulnerability in libc or the app?
[16:31:09] <Piru> might not be a perfect example, but anyway...
[16:32:50] <Piru> *but* if your libc calloc() would overflow internally and allocate too little memory, THAT would be a vulnerability in libc
[16:41:21] <gevaerts> Other real-world example, weren't there a bunch of things that called memset() with the size and value reversed?
[16:41:34] <gevaerts> Hardly memset()'s fault, really
[16:45:39] <Piru> right. that's a good one as well
[16:46:15] <Piru> another one is misunderstanding how strncat works. very common
[16:47:16] <Piru> many think that the size passed limits the final end result (dst), but no, it restricts the thing being added (src)
[16:49:02] <gevaerts> They're the sort of thing where I tend to open the man page before typing anything
[16:49:18] <Piru> the amount of char buf[SIZE]; strncat(buf, SIZE, something); is staggering
[16:51:51] <gevaerts> Indeed
[16:53:44] <Piru> (yeah yeah not being 0 terminated there is another issue)
[16:56:03] <Piru> yet another of my favourites: what will x be here? char buf[2]; int x = snprintf(buf, sizeof(buf), "%s", "plop");
[16:59:21] * gevaerts checks :)
[16:59:48] <gevaerts> 70 6c?
[17:01:05] <Piru> 4
[17:01:49] <Piru> next question: what will the values in buf[2] be? :)
[17:02:13] <gevaerts> Oh, of course
[17:02:20] <gevaerts> Misreading the question is always a good start!
[17:02:31] <gevaerts> Well, buf[2] will be 4 of course
[17:03:47] <gevaerts> I mean, it makes sense from some perspectives, this way you can figure out if truncation has actually happened
[17:04:04] <Piru> buf[0] will be 'p' and buf[1] will be '\0'
[17:05:10] <Piru> snprintf is the good guy, you're less likely to mess up with it, unless of course you don't realize the specifics of the return value
[17:05:14] <gevaerts> Hmmm. Back to the man page
[17:05:43] <Piru> the man page is not very clear about this btw. bad wording
[17:06:26] <gevaerts> Indeed
[17:06:30] <Piru> "The  functions  snprintf() and vsnprintf() do not write more than size bytes (including the terminating null byte ('\0'))."
[17:07:22] <bagder> that's the reason why we renamed the internal snprintf() clone we have internally in curl
[17:07:27] <Piru> that's not explicit about the terminator always being there (assuming size > 0)
[17:07:36] <bagder> the return code I mean
[17:07:40] <Piru> right
[17:08:28] * bagder got a third shot
[17:09:10] * zelest has to wait a few more weeks
[17:09:10] <gevaerts> The C99 spec is pretty clear for snprintf()
[17:09:39] <gevaerts> Takes a few more lines, but it's unambiguous
[17:11:10] <gevaerts> That one also specifies that s is allowed to be null if n is 0, which may be useful to know :)
[17:12:34] * gevaerts hopes bagder won't have the occasional unpleasant effects of the third shot
[17:13:18] <bagder> I had almost no reaction to the first two
[17:13:36] * zelest went to the E.R after the first shot
[17:13:40] <bagder> wow
[17:13:44] <zelest> but was meh about the second
[17:13:49] <zelest> severse chest pain and trouble breathing
[17:14:02] <zelest> but the doctors found nothing.. so.. *shrugs*
[17:14:23] <zelest> got the same pain from the second shot.. but was more calm about it as the doctors didn't find anything specific
[17:14:29] <gevaerts> I didn't feel great after all of them, with a light fever after I think the second
[17:14:33] <zelest> so I'm not super pleased about the third one :o
[17:15:41] <Piru> I got mine in dec 30th after I wrote a small python script that bruteforced canncellations from the reservation system. I got it for the next day after 30 mins of running the script. :>
[17:16:10] <bagder> haha
[17:16:23] <Piru> cancellations*
[17:17:09] <Piru> wife got hers on 31st. same method ;-)
[17:17:25] <Piru> this is why we have computers, no?
[17:17:48] <Piru> I called this a "life hack"
[17:19:16] <gevaerts> Well, if you don't hammer the system to death and not too many people are doing this... :)
[17:20:03] <Piru> oh one thing: the script only nofified me of the free slots, I still made the reservation manually. making it fully automated would have been a bit too unfair :>
[17:21:13] <gevaerts> With you probably being sensible and rate-limiting the requests, that was probably lighter on the system than people hitting refresh in a web browser every five seconds
[17:21:14] <Piru> it also backed off if the system put the client to wait queue. even though this "please wait n minutes" thing is actually only really effective against real browsers
[17:21:58] <Piru> the REST API is still available immediately on the next request. but I definitely didn't want to DoS it
[17:22:55] <gevaerts> Did you use curl?
[17:23:48] <Piru> no. :( py-requests - but only because I had to get it going fast

[18:38:50] <bagder> I bet they only provide perhaps the easy api or something
[18:39:42] <gevaerts> That would be my guess too
[18:40:00] <gevaerts> Well, they do multi, but that's probably the limit
[18:40:38] <jfuller> good of curl to provide docs for project
[18:41:09] <jfuller> is there source code
[18:41:34] <gevaerts> Well, I'd say having them link to the curl website for docs is good, as that means they can't be incompatible and claim it's not a bug :)
