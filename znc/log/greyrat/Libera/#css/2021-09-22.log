[14:15:54] <dostoyevsky2> When I write my own html I always find it hard to click on elements... it seems that a lot of uis use much more generous clickboxes than me...
[14:16:47] <Rockwood_> where is your code?
[14:18:51] <dostoyevsky2> it seems like just using and input type=checkbox isn't enough, in many uis they just make the whole label clickable too...  I guess that could be implemented with javascript

[16:12:04] <GuiToris> hello, I have a 2 questions, this is what I'm using : https://bpa.st/RC3A   1) how can I change the opacity of the image 2) how can I limit the maximum size of the image?
[16:12:27] <GuiToris> I don't want to scale it higher than 100%
[16:20:11] <hassoon> GuiToris: make us a real fiddle sample
[16:20:16] <hassoon> `paste GuiToris
[16:20:21] <hassoon> ,paste GuiToris
[16:20:31] <hassoon> `live GuiToris
[16:20:36] <hassoon> ,live GuiToris
[16:20:38] <hassoon> meh whatever
[16:20:59] <hassoon> GuiToris: https://ghanhass.github.io/myfiddle/
[16:25:12] <GuiToris> I pasted the provided css there but it won't do anything
[16:30:34] <GuiToris> do I have to put all these into a div to change the opacity?
[16:32:27] <thykka> GuiToris, if it won't do *anything*, maybe your selector isn't right? Or maybe the element has no content, and thus no dimensions?
[16:32:38] <thykka> impossible to tell from just a few pasted properties
[16:34:02] <GuiToris> ok, I'll show you the full code, it's not much longer. I just didn't find them related
[16:34:27] <hassoon> GuiToris: you need to prepare html code as well
[16:34:32] <hassoon> GuiToris: then you click the share button
[16:34:49] <hassoon> GuiToris: and then you are given a fiddle link that you should paste here
[16:35:00] <GuiToris> I don't have HTML code
[16:35:04] <hassoon> GuiToris: make one
[16:36:26] <GuiToris> this is all I have https://bpa.st/WO6Q
[16:36:35] <GuiToris> I don't know how to create a HTML code
[16:37:00] <GuiToris> I don't know this stuff, I just copy-pasted everything from the net
[16:37:18] <GuiToris> I'd like to make the background transparent, and not to be bigger than 100%
[16:38:47] *** Quits: Rockwood_ (~Rocky@user/rocky) (Quit: The Time is Over)
[16:38:53] <hassoon> GuiToris: css is a useless dead nothingness without HTML
[16:39:25] <hassoon> GuiToris: so try to reproduce the the use case that you have, and prepare us the html+css code sample in a live fiddle, such as the one i gave you
[16:53:30] <thykka> GuiToris, you would have something like this, yes? https://jsfiddle.net/yphdes85/
[16:54:42] <GuiToris> I guess so, I don't know what .card is exactly
[16:55:12] <GuiToris> (and I don't have text)
[16:55:55] <thykka> .card would be a class selector
[16:56:23] <thykka> so when you have a block of rules under .card in CSS, those rules get applied to any HTML element with class="card"
[16:57:01] <thykka> but without such an element, it is meaningless. Nothing will happen, because CSS rules always operate on elements.
[16:57:26] <GuiToris> so there must be an HTML code someone, I just don't know it :S
[16:57:42] <GuiToris> I removed the HTML code you wrote and everything disappeared :/
[16:57:51] <GuiToris> I thought the image would be displayed
[16:58:01] <thykka> why did you think that, after what i just said? :D
[16:58:33] <GuiToris> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ It's difficult to pretend that I understand what's going on :D
[16:58:40] <thykka> HTML is what defines ALL the content on your page. CSS only tells how the HTML should be presented, nothing more.
[16:58:59] <thykka> you can make a simple website with only HTML, but if you had only CSS, the page would be blank.
[16:59:25] <thykka> but what is your overall aim here? what are you trying to build?
[16:59:29] <GuiToris> but you have background-image: url("//placekitten.com/200/300");
[16:59:35] <GuiToris> why can't I see the kittens?
[16:59:48] <thykka> the element is not tall enough for the kittens to be visible
[17:00:09] <GuiToris> I mean without the HTML code
[17:00:17] <GuiToris> it's gone, I deleted it, I don't have text yet
[17:00:37] <thykka> because CSS doesn't work without HTML
[17:00:46] <thykka> you cannot style nothing
[17:01:30] <GuiToris> how would you create a blank page with that background image?
[17:02:14] <thykka> first I'd need the HTML page, and if there's literally nothing else, then I'd use `html` as the CSS selector, so that the background image gets applied to the <html> element
[17:02:43] <thykka> like so: https://jsfiddle.net/thykka/yphdes85/2/
[17:05:29] <GuiToris> thanks this is what I had, I'd like to make this semi-transparent and not to be bigger than 100%
[17:06:00] <thykka> 100% of what?
[17:06:13] <GuiToris> my animation is 500px x 500px
[17:06:38] <GuiToris> I don't want it to be bigger than that
[17:06:48] <GuiToris> but if the screen is smaller it can be smaller
[17:06:58] <GuiToris> I think that's what contain does
[17:07:09] <GuiToris> (according to w3school where I copied everything)
[17:07:43] <thykka> sounds like you don't actually want a background-image
[17:07:50] <thykka> but rather an actual <img> element
[17:10:51] <thykka> semi-transparent kitten, that won't get bigger than 500px, but does get smaller, if there's no space otherwise: https://jsfiddle.net/thykka/yphdes85/8/
[17:10:55] <thykka> oops
[17:11:00] <thykka> https://jsfiddle.net/thykka/yphdes85/9/
[17:14:01] <GuiToris> no, I don't really need a background image, I chose that because I can have text above that
[17:14:10] <GuiToris> I'll check out if I can do the same with this
[17:15:00] <GuiToris> can't I specify the img in the css code alone?
[17:15:09] <thykka> no, that's not what CSS is for
[17:15:24] <thykka> content goes into HTML, *style* goes in CSS
[17:15:41] <thykka> here, the style is to make it semi-transparent, but the image itself is the content
[17:16:44] <theskillwithin> object-fit contain
[17:16:57] <thykka> ideally, you should be able to rip out all the CSS, and what remains would still be readable
[17:16:58] <theskillwithin> or maybe aspect-ratio: 1/ 1
[17:17:11] <thykka> what?
[17:17:30] <theskillwithin> oops read wrong
[17:18:05] <GuiToris> I'm not sure if I can add an image there, but I'll try, thanks a lot :)
[17:19:20] <thykka> GuiToris, if this is a situation where you have no control over the HTML, then yes, there are some ways to insert an image into some existing element via CSS. Problem is, it's bad for search engine optimization, it's bad for accessibility, and it's probably bad for page load speed too
[17:19:32] <thykka> all in all, not recommended, unless it's literally the only choice
[17:20:04] <GuiToris> this isn't going to be uploaded to the web
[17:20:27] <GuiToris> I'm using a learning program Anki that allows me to style the cards
[17:20:51] <GuiToris> I don't have an HTML field, but a CSS one
[17:21:28] <GuiToris> I may be wrong, but that's how I understand the whole thing
[17:22:03] <thykka> https://docs.ankiweb.net/templates/styling.html
[17:22:06] <thykka> this?
[17:22:20] <thykka> > Your templates can contain arbitrary HTML
[17:30:43] <GuiToris> but do you think I can mix HTML with CSS?

[20:54:01] <AMcBain> dontyouloveshort, The first one also loads a bootstrap-combined file which contains the definition for .well and the second paste doesn't.
[20:54:33] <dontyouloveshort> ah, that looked like a "double" include
[20:54:35] <dontyouloveshort> let me try that
[21:07:45] <dontyouloveshort> yes it was missing, althoug im mixing bootstrap 2 and 5 now
[21:07:56] <dontyouloveshort> couldnt find bootstrap5 version of that file
[21:08:27] <dontyouloveshort> will look into this tomorrow at work, thx

[22:00:18] <lantech19446> I want to double check my comprehension because i'm still new to css, in the following code does the height declaration force the image within that class to have a height of 190px regardless of the actual size of the image?

[22:08:38] <otisolsen70> I have a simple site that uses bootstrap for navigation. I recently went from bootstrap 4 to bootstrap 5. Since then, the navigation in the top stopped working. That is, when the navigation bar is collapsed due to narrow screen, there should be a button (burger) to expand the nav menu. But nothing happens when you click it. Example of how it works here: https://dev.pgsupport.dk/  What am I missing for this to work?
