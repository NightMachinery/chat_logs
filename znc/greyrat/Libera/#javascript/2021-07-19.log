[00:57:55] <silly> how is useContext related to useState? there's no useState here https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usecontext
[00:58:41] <silly> but everywhere i look they say use state with contexts if you want components to be updated when values in context chages
[00:59:09] <silly> i don't see the point of using state with contexts
[01:00:11] <GreenJello> if you need a value that changes over time, you use useState
[01:00:18] <joepie91> silly: possibly they are referring to passing down a set* function through a context?
[01:00:33] <stenno> https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html#caveats
[01:00:40] <GreenJello> independently: if you need to pass a value to indirect children, you use context
[01:00:41] <joepie91> it's a common-ish technique to update state up the tree from within a deeply nested coponent
[01:00:44] <joepie91> component *
[01:00:53] <GreenJello> so if you need a value that changes over time to be passed to indirect children, you use both together
[01:02:06] <GreenJello> for example, if your theme sometimes changes from light mode to dark mode based on user interaction
[01:02:17] <GreenJello> to use the example from the linked docs
[01:02:37] <silly> meh, i thought my useContext component would be updated when context vallues change
[01:02:43] <stenno> it does
[01:02:50] <GreenJello> you could pass only the current theme color through context by storing either 'light' or 'dark' in a useState
[01:02:54] <silly> not without useStat

[01:05:19] <stenno> in case of doubt, GreenJello is probably right

[01:11:10] <GreenJello> oh yep, HMR is prone to doing weird things
[01:12:04] <silly> without it i wouldn't have seen any updates to the context
[01:12:12] <GreenJello> but you also shouldn't expect that things don't render for arbitrary reasons, unless they specific prevent themselves from rendering
[01:13:00] <silly> eww ok, got it after reading twice
[01:13:31] <GreenJello> it's always a state update (I think even with HMR under the hood), but you could easily introduce a timer that causes 5 renders per frame in App, and lots of things are going to render lots of times
[01:14:09] <GreenJello> so you usually have to work through these things with logic instead of testing, unless you very carefully make minimal test cases

[02:19:57] <austincheney> firefox is crushing my soul
[02:20:24] <austincheney> would anybody know how to stop firefox from redirecting http localhost requests to https?
[02:20:31] <wroathe> That'll teach you to have a soul
[02:21:06] <entuland> austincheney, that's probably a stray of previous redirections sent by the local server
[02:21:16] <austincheney> firefox is doing this by manually typing in the address to the address bar, by editing and resending requests from dev tools, and also by submitting requests to it from the terminal
[02:21:37] <austincheney> i have tried deleting all my browser history
[02:21:39] <austincheney> no help
[02:21:40] <entuland> doublecheck your server is redirecting properly, then try doing a full cache clear and restart of Firefox
[02:22:04] <austincheney> in this case firefox is the server as I am running it with the -start-debugging-server flag
[02:22:55] <stenno> do you use https everywhere or so?
[02:23:09] <austincheney> not on localhost
[02:23:31] <entuland> are you sure it's not interfering in any way?

[02:24:21] <entuland> in similar cases, when I want to be 100% sure, I normally don't trust exceptions / disabling or the alike, I simply completely get rid of the program I want to rule out
[02:24:54] <silly> sounds more like about:config to me
[02:25:18] <silly> https://stackoverflow.com/a/54559584
[02:25:25] <austincheney> just to prove its not my application I open firefox with the flag.  You will know when firefox becomes a server because the address bar is a red/black striped background.  Then I manually edit the request to localhost in dev tools to explicitly resend to http://localhost:9000 and it still sends to https
[02:26:11] <austincheney> so I have set these to false in about:config - browser.urlbar.autoFill, browser.fixup.fallback-to-https, network.stricttransportsecurity.preloadlist
[02:26:21] <silly> i've never heard of firefox becoming a server tho
[02:26:24] <entuland> probably you found it already, but just in case, this post matches your case: https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1246512 - see if there is any useful pointer

[02:56:25] <monk12> hello all, i had a quick question. I was reading a chapter on TypeScript in a Javascript book. so i saw syntax like this for 'optional chaining': car?.wheels?.count
[02:56:27] <stenno> (this is _not_ the one linked by silly )
[02:57:01] <monk12> but i also saw some syntax that they didn't cover i think... syntax like so for this interface:     interface GreetingProps { name?: string }
[02:57:15] <monk12> Does that mean the name prop is optional?
[02:57:19] <wroathe> monk12: Yes
[02:57:21] <stenno> those have nothing to do with each other
[02:57:23] <stenno> its nullable
[02:57:32] <stenno> name prop is nullable
[02:58:11] <monk12> I think they didn't really cover that, just started using it. Thanks for the info wroathe+stenno.
[02:58:21] <GreenJello> in the type it's an existential modifier, which is slightly different from nullable chaining
[02:58:21] <stenno> ?. though is something different, thats nullish coalescing operator
[02:58:34] <stenno> er optional chaining
[02:58:40] <stenno> not nullish coalescing
[02:58:52] <monk12> yeh i was about to say Nullish Coalescing was syntax like so: const result = val1 ?? val2;
[02:59:31] <GreenJello> yeah, optional chaining is concerned with values, but in the interface it's saying the property may or may not exist, but if it does exist, it has to be a string (not null/undefined)

[06:05:13] <silly> i'll ignore that for the time being...
[06:05:35] <silly> oh, it mentioned a memory leak somewhere in a warning at some point...
[06:06:03] <silly> i do have 32gb ram tho
[06:07:38] <GreenJello> the problem with memory leaks is that you will eventually run out of memory, even if the browser for some reason gave your tab more than 2gb of RAM
[06:07:59] <silly> uh there's a 2gb limit?
[06:08:29] <silly> actually i meant `return {...newData}` is far better than `return mutatedOldData`
[06:08:35] <GreenJello> for JS objects and stuff, yeah, unless some browsers have changed it
[06:08:53] <GreenJello> some things aren't included in that, like typed arrays
[06:09:12] <GreenJello> about that, the problem is that you're mutating the data
[06:09:19] <GreenJello> don't do that
[06:09:39] <silly> now it's no longer mutated data
[06:09:45] <GreenJello> yes it is
[06:09:56] <silly> new object with new content
[06:10:38] <GreenJello> if you're not setting any properties when doing the spread, then it can't possibly have changed without mutating it
[06:11:09] <GreenJello> you seem to be spreading after mutating, which doesn't make the previous code retroactively not mutate
[06:11:37] <silly> you're right, but it did change... `update({last, raw: [....data.raw, last]});`
[06:12:09] <silly> there's nothing left from the code before
[06:12:21] <GreenJello> I don't know what anything in that code is
[06:12:34] <silly> yep, i feel fine now

[14:56:02] <dimi1947> ...I have heard many times before the term syntacti sugar...but what it means...is it the same as saying "make code more readable"?
[14:58:17] <silly> it's different syntax for the same goal

[14:59:37] <dimi1947> got it
[15:00:17] <silly> bottom line is, js has a keyword `class` but these are not real oop classes
[15:01:26] <silly> !class @dimi1947
[15:01:26] <jellobot> dimi1947, JavaScript does not have class-based inheritance (only a "class" keyword in ES6). Instead, it has constructor functions which initialize newly created objects that are linked to the object referred to by the constructor's "prototype" property. These instances point to the prototype and use it for fallback property lookup. See also: !classes, !inheritance
[15:01:47] <silly> !classes
[15:01:47] <jellobot> silly, Class hierarchies? Don't do that! http://raganwald.com/2014/03/31/class-hierarchies-dont-do-that.html (See also, !inheritance)
[15:01:54] <silly> !inheritance
[15:01:54] <jellobot> silly, JavaScript does not really have “inheritance” like classical languages. What it has is more properly called “property delegation” or “behavior delegation” http://davidwalsh.name/javascript-objects - ie `foo.bar(baz)` when `!foo.hasOwnProperty('bar')` is essentially doing `Object.getPrototypeOf(foo).bar.call(foo, baz)`

[15:20:02] <nedbat> dimi1947: i think that statement could be overly pedantic. If you define two classes, with "extends", then the child class will have all the methods of the parent class. Isn't that the main thing you want from inheritance?
[15:21:00] <dimi1947> with the way you are putting it you are right...
[15:22:45] <nedbat> silly: perhaps you can clarify: if a Python programmer started using JavaScript classes without realizing they weren't "real classes", where would they be surprised? How would they act differently?

[17:24:52] <Donitz> it's debug after all
[17:25:16] <Donitz> hmm, it is not
[17:25:18] <Donitz> that's dumb
[17:25:33] <entuland> the default on chrome is to show info, warnings and errors
[17:25:38] <Donitz> what is the point in having multiple levels of logging if they're all just shown always
[17:25:45] <Donitz> in firefox is it shown
[17:26:15] <entuland> seems like debug logs are only shown in verbose mode on chrome
[17:26:26] <Alexendoo> Shown by default would be the better option imo
[17:26:40] <Alexendoo> You don't want to accidentally miss something, but if you want to hide noise it's only a button away
[17:27:05] <Donitz> eh, I guess the argument is
[17:27:11] <Donitz> if you have the web developer tools open
[17:27:14] <Donitz> you're probably debugging :P
[17:27:49] <entuland> verbose isn't in the default on chrome, so there the behavior is the one you want, at least

[20:19:30] <wroathe> pulse: Also, why are you using jshint? eslint has been the standard for like 4 or 5 years now.
[20:19:38] <entuland> phryk, can't tell, probably I would just inform the user about the two options
[20:19:43] <pulse> wroathe, old habits
[20:19:46] <wroathe> GreenJello: Ah

[20:27:34] <pulse> from what i can gather online, they're basically not much different, except that eslint is more configurable
[20:28:00] <pulse> and it has a bigger ecosystem for various framework
[20:28:08] <pulse> none of which really matter to me so i think i'm gonna keep using jshint

[20:33:11] <pulse> well it doesn't run on its own like jshint :p

[20:34:10] <pulse> anyway, is there a significant benefit to using eslint over jshint
[20:34:11] <wroathe> This is the sane defaults. You can actually put that in your package.json if it makes you happy
[20:34:25] <pulse> i don't have package.json in the project i'm working on
[20:34:25] <pulse> :D
[20:34:44] <wroathe> Well, then .eslintrc.js, then
[20:34:47] <pulse> see that's why i prefer jshint, no additional cruft, just lets me know if i'm doing something stupid
[20:34:52] <GreenJello> eslint is better in pretty much every way
[20:35:02] <pulse> with eslint the supposition is i'm already deeply embedded into the npm ecosystem
[20:35:10] <wroathe> No it's not
[20:35:24] <wroathe> I pointed that out to help you with the complaint that you'd need an additional configruation file
[20:35:33] <wroathe> Assuming that you were already using a package.json
[20:35:51] <pulse> i think, and i'm obviously not sure, but i think you guys may be operating on outdated information. jshint isn't jslint, it's progressed a lot
[20:36:04] <pulse> wroathe, yeah that's reasonable i suppose
[20:36:27] <wroathe> Also, when I said "you should check it out" I didn't mean "I'm open to any questions you may have comparing eslint and jshint."
[20:36:32] <wroathe> I just meant you should compare the two

[20:52:07] <Alexendoo> There is an init command that chooses some preset for you fwiw

[20:52:41] <pulse> i mean it's fine
[20:52:43] <pulse> but it's a bit rude
[20:52:54] <pulse> when i write utilities i specifically design them not to do this unless the user wants it
[20:52:54] <Alexendoo> I would say you'd want that anyway, even if it was empty
[20:53:04] <codebam> pulse: you can put .eslintrc inside ~ iirc
[20:53:06] <pulse> git uses a global config for a very good reason
[20:53:15] <codebam> pulse: git uses ~/.gitconfig
[20:53:23] <wroathe> Actually git uses a tiered configuration system
[20:53:34] <wroathe> You've got a config file in your project's .git directory, for example
[20:53:49] <pulse> yeah i guess it's kinda the same
[20:54:00] <Alexendoo> Having a file, even if empty, lets editor plugins know they can display stuff
[20:54:57] <codebam> it would be nice if it didn't throw an error about not having a config and instead use a default I think is what pulse is trying to says
[20:55:01] <codebam> s/says/say
[20:55:08] <pulse> something like that
[20:55:31] <pulse> i mean it's a minor complaint
[20:56:30] <pulse> i like it doesnt' complain about my ternary style though, that's what won me over tbh
[20:56:37] <pulse> :p
[20:56:49] <Alexendoo> Yeah I get that codebam, I just think having an unambiguous indicator X project uses eslint is more valuable
[20:56:52] <wroathe> pulse: Also, you can keep a configuration per-user on your machine: https://eslint.org/docs/2.13.1/user-guide/configuring#configuration-cascading-and-hierarchy
[20:57:02] <wroathe> pulse: Same idea as git
[20:57:32] <pulse> fair enough

[21:33:09] <systemfault> Let's fight each other about what "sane defaults" are :)
[21:34:09] <systemfault> The only thing that would be fine, I believe... would be that eslint only checks syntax when no config is found or something like that. Is it already doing that? (No clue)
[21:34:59] <Alexendoo> It doesn't run without a config, which is the behaviour I'm happy with
[21:35:42] <GreenJello> even with an empty config it's going to reject a lot of valid code, since it defaults to assuming ancient JS versions
[21:36:11] <pulse> so when another linter comes by, you'll need another file Alexendoo ? :p
[21:37:05] <Alexendoo> pulse: Yeah that's the point really, say another linter started getting popular and I work on projects with both, they will definitely have some incompatible rules. If I have two editor plugins how else do they know which one should be enabled/disabled?
[21:37:19] <GreenJello> rome is a potential successor to eslint, but haven't been following it too closely

[22:01:04] <ljharb> Alexendoo: a project that doesn't use eslint is highly likely to be garbage.
[22:01:17] <ljharb> Alexendoo: if you think you've found a good one that doesn't, i'd be very interested to see it
[22:02:15] <ljharb> and yes, before eslint was the only linter (as it is likely to remain for a long time), there were 3. and all my hundred-some projects at the time thus had 3 config files.
[22:02:56] <pulse> linter is just a time saving method, you could just code review manually
[22:03:12] <pulse> so there's no way of telling a product's quality based on whether or not it uses tool X or not
[22:03:19] *** Joins: junktext (~junktext@77.247.181.217)
[22:03:35] <ljharb> if a project isn't choosing a defacto-standard time saving method then yes, you can assume the project is bad because it's making dumb choices
[22:04:00] <ljharb> in general, you can't assume that for any tool X. but eslint is long past the point where it's a generic tool.
[22:04:08] <ljharb> (in the JS ecosystem, ofc)
[22:04:39] <pulse> or code could be written by a mad genius who doesn't make any mistakes
[22:04:45] <pulse> you never know :p
[22:04:49] <ljharb> note that while i have lots of opinions about what the linter config should be, i'm not attaching any of that to this topic - simply the existence of linting is a prereq for good code.
[22:04:50] <ljharb> lol
[22:04:50] <pulse> in principle i agree, linter is a must
[22:04:57] <pulse> but it's not like a law of nature
[22:05:02] <ljharb> introduce me to one and i'll change my stance, but i haven't seen one yet
[22:05:13] <pulse> a project could be 100 lines of extremely complex math
[22:05:17] <ocx32> ljharb can you help
[22:05:19] <pulse> is a linter really going to help it?
[22:05:30] <ljharb> pulse: yes
[22:05:33] <ashnur> yeah, remember when old Crocks started his grumbling with jslint
[22:05:34] <pulse> ljharb, no.
[22:05:35] <ljharb> pulse: because it will help ensure it's consistently readable
[22:05:43] <pulse> more or less irrelevant with 100 lines
[22:05:51] <ljharb> pulse: it'd be relevant with three lines
[22:05:55] <pulse> disagreed
[22:06:01] <ljharb> there is no program too small for linting.
[22:06:06] <pulse> i agree a linter is especially useful at scale
[22:06:15] <pulse> but you could have 10 lines of extremely complex code and linter becomes more or less useless
[22:06:26] <pulse> ljharb, no but you can't judge code quality just based on that
[22:06:28] <ljharb> complex code is the problem there
[22:06:33] <ashnur> i'd say people not using a formatter are just vandals
[22:06:35] <ljharb> the solution is to fix that it's complex.
[22:06:50] <ljharb> if you find the linter's useless on your code, that's not a signal not to use a linter - that's a signal that your code sucks
[22:06:54] <pulse> ljharb, some problems are naturally complex and require extremely complex math
[22:07:19] <ljharb> and you think these will be authored in 10-100 lines of javascript?
[22:07:21] <pulse> you can't just put every single program into the same basket, tie a bow and call it a day
[22:07:46] <ashnur> but he didn't
[22:07:48] <ljharb> i'd also love to see an example of such a program
[22:08:01] <pulse> i'm just saying, one could exist in principle
[22:08:04] <ashnur> i mean, i like to argue this same exact point against ljharb, but this time he was specific
[22:08:05] <ljharb> lol
[22:08:12] <ljharb> pulse: "in theory" is a really dumb way to make an argument tho
[22:08:14] <ljharb> i'm sure one could exist
[22:08:17] <ljharb> but one does not
[22:08:19] <ljharb> so it doesn't matter
[22:08:26] <pulse> so thought experiments are useless according to you ljharb ?
[22:08:39] <ashnur> lol, stop with the slippery slope pulse
[22:08:43] <ljharb> i'd love to do a thought experiment. give me suck a program
[22:08:44] <ljharb> *such
[22:08:46] <pulse> i'm saying if your project is 100 lines of code, it could be both useless, and not use any linter, and you'd still end up using it because you needed it
[22:08:50] <ljharb> i do not agree
[22:08:59] <pulse> it's fine if you don't agree
[22:09:02] <ljharb> i'm saying that that could not, actually, exist. if you have an example then i'll change my stance
[22:09:02] <Alexendoo> ljharb: ublock origin
[22:09:12] <ljharb> Alexendoo: link?
[22:09:25] <ljharb> but it's not really a thought experiment if the scenario isn't conceivable
[22:09:47] <pulse> how about a ~100 line hash function
[22:09:49] <ashnur> if someone has a problem with eslint, that specifically can be discussed, in theory, until using it becomes costly - which it isn't- i don't see why argue this particular hypothetical
[22:09:53] <Alexendoo> https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock
[22:10:20] <Alexendoo> (it uses an older linter)
[22:10:23] <pulse> ashnur, ljharb claims that if a project doesn't use a linter, that immediately makes it bad and useless
[22:10:29] *** Joins: ttys000 (~ttys000@user/ttys000)
[22:10:29] <pulse> i'm just countering that point with common sense
[22:10:34] <pulse> it's fine to disagree, i don't really care
[22:10:36] <systemfault> Takes 2 minutes to setup eslint... even my playground project in VSCode uses it with "format on save"
[22:10:37] <ljharb> pulse: i said that immediately means it's *likely* to be bad and useless
[22:10:41] <ashnur> this is basically: "imagine the worst possible scenario: therefor everything is better than that" ok, but it's a waste of time
[22:10:41] <ljharb> pulse: i didn't say it proves it is
[22:10:53] <pulse> ljharb, that i agree with
[22:10:58] <ljharb> pulse: well that's what i said
[22:10:59] <ashnur> pulse, again, that's not exactly what ljharb said as a whole
[22:11:25] <ljharb> Alexendoo: ok so a) at least it has a linter, and b) that project is so ancient it doesn't have a package.json
[22:11:40] <ljharb> Alexendoo: so i'd argue it's actually bad code, because it's using legacy patterns.
[22:12:02] <ljharb> Alexendoo: lol i mean, it even has copyright boilerplate in every file, which is a super archaic thing to do
[22:12:24] <ljharb> and, it's not using modules - it's lousy with IIFEs
[22:12:27] <ashnur> ublock is definitely bad code
[22:12:28] <ljharb> so yes, bad project.
[22:12:32] <ljharb> next?
[22:12:48] <pulse> the real offense is that it uses spaces
[22:12:49] <pulse> :P
[22:13:06] <Alexendoo> It's a good project, whether you like the code or not doesn't matter
[22:13:29] <pulse> yeah there's a lot of very useful things out there with very poor code
[22:13:38] <pulse> that's the general situation of things
[22:13:58] <ashnur> i am not saying bad project, just bad code
[22:14:02] <ljharb> pulse: lol agreed there, tabs ftw
[22:14:10] <ljharb> Alexendoo: ok fair. bad code.
[22:14:17] <ashnur> it's like language, most language is terrible language, but it's almost always exceptionally useful
[22:14:23] <ljharb> Alexendoo: but i don't use ublock origin and after seeing the code, i wouldn't
[22:15:01] <stenno> ublock origin is the only decent adblocker
[22:15:24] <ashnur> true, but the code is bad :D
[22:15:42] <stenno> luckily i don't have to read it or maintain it
[22:15:44] <ashnur> i use it, but i checked the code
[22:15:50] <ashnur> i was horrified
[22:16:38] <wroathe> ashnur: What makes the code bad?
[22:18:15] <ljharb> i don't think adblockers are needed at all personally
