[03:46:20] <mistiry> years ago, we worked out in this channel the very rough basics for how you could do DNS over IRC
[03:46:29] <mistiry> so the reverse of what you said
[03:46:33] <mistiry> but, was funny
[04:15:21] <signalblue> yeah
[04:15:25] <signalblue> lol
[04:15:42] <signalblue> because 53/UDP or 53/TCP is not blocked anywhere
[04:18:15] <sd> 12<pâ€‹ublic static void ahendrix() {}> Sure it is. You can just still use it to transfer data when it is because all DNS requests have to make their way back to the authoritative DNS.
[04:18:40] <sd> 12<pâ€‹ublic static void ahendrix() {}> But people force you to use their DNS all the time. Hence DOH

[06:15:33] <catbeard> it's on it's own port so separate ACLs and dstnat routing
[06:15:42] <catbeard> DoH is on 443
[06:15:50] <signalblue> yeah but it being on 443 is better
[06:16:00] <catbeard> depends on your role in the company lol
[06:16:06] <signalblue> LOL
[06:16:16] <signalblue> that's freaking hilarious
[06:16:27] <signalblue> I guess you know what my role in the company is
[06:17:09] <catbeard> so yeah there's iodine
[06:17:17] <catbeard> and other dns / icmp tunneling tools
[06:18:11] <catbeard> works great if dns is standard 53, DoH you need SNI filters, 853 shouldn't have anything going out to anything but DoT endpoints
[06:18:11] <catbeard> by explicit IP/SNI match
[06:18:38] <signalblue> quick question on the topic of DNS... if I own <first_name><last_name>.com, does it make sense, for any reason, to get <first_initial><last_name>.$tld or <middle_initial><last_name>.$tld?
[06:18:43] <signalblue> opinions?
[06:18:46] <catbeard> i set up unbound as a cloudflare teams gateway intercept
[06:18:55] <catbeard> not really
[06:19:03] <catbeard> just more domains to pay whois protection for
[06:19:06] <signalblue> catbeard: like not at all?
[06:19:15] <signalblue> i'm getting whois protection for free
[06:19:16] <xe0n> how can we answer that question lol
[06:19:22] <xe0n> its like asking if i should go buy another domain...
[06:19:22] <xe0n> lol
[06:19:24] <catbeard> depends on your name's seo value
[06:19:31] <catbeard> lol
[06:19:34] <signalblue> xe0n: that's correct
[06:19:44] <signalblue> name has little seo value atm
[06:19:46] <catbeard> if you get it for free, go for it

[06:20:08] <catbeard> still
[06:20:35] <signalblue> because I already have like 5 name-related domains
[06:21:00] <xe0n> do what you want...

[06:22:33] <signalblue> catbeard: what do you say, should I go for them>
[06:22:37] <signalblue> ?*
[06:22:46] <catbeard> only if you get a good deal
[06:23:02] <catbeard> and you're actually going to use them
[06:23:08] <signalblue> use... not really
[06:23:27] <signalblue> good deal, **maybe** for the first year, but not the renewals
[06:23:39] <catbeard> no real point in having them if you're not going to use it perpetually
[06:24:03] <catbeard> just another yearly cost
[06:24:29] <signalblue> perhaps <first_name>@<middle_initial><last_name>.com or something

[06:32:17] <catbeard> like domain register points to nameservers that have A records for ns1/ns2 to a whm vps to manage your zones, or you have registrar glue records pointing ns1/ns2 from the registrar to a dns server without A records in the zone itself?

[07:09:31] <jimender2> So fun fact, restoring raw mysql ibd files from a bad install of MySQL sucks
[07:09:47] <catbeard> helps if you turn off mysqld first
[07:09:54] <catbeard> and set innodb_force_recovery
[07:11:09] <catbeard> also percona tools are quite nice
[07:12:04] <jimender2> I had to recreate table, then drop the table space, transfer in the new files, set correct owner, then import the tablespace
[07:12:37] <jimender2> my sys table got f'ed up on my old server
[07:13:06] <jimender2> cant get mysql to work on my main server so installed it on a secondary one
[07:13:58] <catbeard> DISCARD TABLESPACE ewww
[07:14:14] <catbeard> yeah hope ya got good sqldump backups
[07:14:37] <jimender2> luckily it was only like 10 tables but.... Im backing up better from now on.
[07:15:00] <catbeard> orchestrator is nice for HA
[07:15:58] <jimender2> I need to redo my homelab setup
[07:16:48] <jimender2> is it better to have one - two mysql servers and just use multiple dbs in them or each db have its own server?
[07:20:26] <catbeard> imo it's better to split r/w with proxysql and route reads to slave, writes to master
[07:20:38] <catbeard> akin to what orchestrator does, but i think that does it with semisync replication

What would be the best way to do so? I have a Raspberry Pi that I don't mind leaving on 24/7 if a server would be possible on it. I set up 3 different Windows 10 VMs yesterday, I'm guessing I could run a server and use these VMs as local users to play with permissions and s
[20:05:47] <sd> 02<râ€‹xxt> (I'm a beginner, any online ressources / books links would be very much appreciated)
[20:12:34] <mistiry> Run a webserver on the Pi, or DNS or something. 
[20:12:49] <mistiry> use your VM's as clients to test/play with
[20:15:28] <mistiry> Set up a Windows Server VM instead of Windows 10, and set up AD. 
[20:15:54] <mistiry> Run IIS on a Windows Server VM and get an website running.
[20:16:11] <sd> 10<Kâ€‹ingReeaper90> you can get a windows server evaluation (180 day trial) on microsofts site and install it as a vm, you already have your workstation vms
[20:17:17] <sd> 02<râ€‹xxt> So I could just run the server on a Windows Server VM and use the other VMs as local users instead of setting everything up on a Pi?
[20:17:39] <sd> 02<râ€‹xxt> Thanks, I'll look this up!
[20:17:42] <mistiry> No reason you couldnt do both.
[20:17:58] <mistiry> Setup windows server and AD. Setup Pi as a webserver or something.
[20:18:30] <sd> 02<râ€‹xxt> And sorry in advance haha, I'm not very knowledgeable. I know tech and basic stuff but never really got into servers, networking, etc
[20:20:00] <sd> 10<Kâ€‹ingReeaper90> thats why we're here, to exchange knowledge. set up your windows server and make it the domain controller, then add your workstations to the domain. you can also set up IIS on this server so it functions as a webserver, but thats up to you since you want to use your PI for something
[20:21:15] <sd> 02<râ€‹xxt> Thanks, I'll look all of this up later because it still kinda feels like gibberish! :harold2:
[20:22:01] <sd> 02<râ€‹xxt> I guess that's why I never really got into servers, I always have found it to be superrrrr hard. But now I'm 19 and trying to work in IT and possibly become Sysadmin so I don't have a choice, I have to get into it as much as I can haha
[20:22:12] <sd> 10<Kâ€‹ingReeaper90> Look up Kevtech on youtube he has easy to digest tutorials.
[20:22:48] <sd> 10<Kâ€‹ingReeaper90> Its not as hard as you might think. Theyre intimidating from the surface but just windows machines with more functions underneath
[20:23:01] <sd> 10<Kâ€‹ingReeaper90> but thats why we lab, to build and break things
[20:23:04] <sd> 02<râ€‹xxt> Yeah I watched one of his videos yesterday about the first things he would do as a Sysadmin on the job for the first time. I learned a bit about RSAT and how to install it
[20:23:50] <sd> 02<râ€‹xxt> Yeah I also still do not understand how physical servers works lol, switches, NAS, etc lol I'll have to look this up too
[20:24:22] <sd> 10<Kâ€‹ingReeaper90> go to youtube and find professormesser and take his comptia A+ course
[20:24:32] <sd> 10<Kâ€‹ingReeaper90> perfect place to start to get familiarity
[20:25:13] <mistiry> If you do not understand what a switch does, you are perhaps starting several steps beyond where you should be. 
[20:25:36] <sd> 10<Kâ€‹ingReeaper90> start with helpdesk before sysadmin. Most sysadmin roles will expect you to have the foundational knowledge you will get in a helpdesk role
[20:25:52] <sd> 02<râ€‹xxt> yeah but I mean I still have to do a sysadmin training lol I'm not planning on just learning on my own
[20:26:26] <mistiry> Right but you are asking to set up servers, but if you don't have a basic understanding of networking to even know what the purpose of a switch is, you're going to have a hard time.
[20:26:43] <mistiry> Sounds like you need an Intro to IT course not a "how to be a sysadmin" course
[20:27:06] <sd> 10<Kâ€‹ingReeaper90> sysadmin is a mid level role, you will need a entry level role. start with helpdesk level 1
[20:27:12] <mistiry> Sysadmin isnt an entry-level position, really. Previous knowledge and expereince is needed first. Large portion of sysadmins started on helpdesk.
[20:27:28] <sd> 02<râ€‹xxt> Yeah I'm also looking for an helpdesk job right now
[20:27:39] <mistiry> You need an entry level tier 1 helpdesk role. and you need to work that for a bit. 
[20:27:43] <mistiry> "pay your dues" as it were
[20:28:26] <sd> 10<Kâ€‹ingReeaper90> Take the comptia A+ course, that will help you understand IT and a foundational level, so you know what you are talking about in a helpdesk interview
[20:28:43] <mistiry> You can't run until you can walk. 
[20:28:53] <sd> 02<râ€‹xxt> Yeah I know, I just wanted to play a bit with servers in VMs and stuff. It's not like I was buying stuff for a homelab lol
[20:29:21] <sd> 10<Kâ€‹ingReeaper90> nothing wrong with building stuff, but first must know what everything does
[20:29:32] <mistiry> Right, but if you don't have at least a basic working knowledge of networking, you're starting out on step 6 though.
[20:29:38] <sd> 02<râ€‹xxt> even if I VM all that for now?
[20:30:01] <mistiry> Physical or virtual doesnt matter.
[20:30:11] <sd> 10<Kâ€‹ingReeaper90> run your vms, thats fine but I would devote at least 50% of my time to learning the basics in a course
[20:30:23] <sd> 10<Kâ€‹ingReeaper90> or you wont even know if your lab is being built properly
[20:31:11] <sd> 02<râ€‹xxt> alright, then I'll look all of this up. CompTIA A+ would teach me physical servers/networking too?
[20:32:08] <sd> 10<Kâ€‹ingReeaper90> comptia A+ is a starting point in IT, will introduce you to all the things you'll see in an IT environment
[20:32:30] <sd> 10<Kâ€‹ingReeaper90> it doesnt go too deep as it is an introductory course but it is very wide as there are a lot of things to learn
[20:33:08] <sd> 10<Kâ€‹ingReeaper90> start there then move to network+ that will teach you networking but it is not entry level so do them in order
[20:33:14] <sd> 02<râ€‹xxt> and I guess that once I'm done learning what is showed on the CompTIA A+ course, I can take the test on the website and get the official cert? or is it useless?
[20:33:27] <mistiry> They are useless later on
[20:33:32] <mistiry> But for now, no.
[20:33:34] <sd> 10<Kâ€‹ingReeaper90> yes you can get the cert and it is far from useless starting out
[20:33:41] <mistiry> Since you have no expereince or anything to point to yet
[20:33:47] <sd> 10<Kâ€‹ingReeaper90> A+ will get you a job interview
[20:34:21] <mistiry> Later, years into your career, it wont hold much weight. But for now, it shows you're taking good steps toward wanting to start out
[20:34:41] <sd> 10<Kâ€‹ingReeaper90> with an A+ cert you will likely be looked at and compared to someone with about a year of experience

[20:35:13] <sd> 02<râ€‹xxt> a college near me also offers a 48h CompTIA A+ preparation course

[21:59:53] <shakygator> no anyone can be an MSP
[21:59:54] *** Joins: ses (uid38151@id-38151.stonehaven.irccloud.com)
[21:59:56] <sd> 13<Câ€‹olour> Imagine a company that supports 100 odd other companys IT infra
[22:00:00] <sd> 13<sâ€‹ea> hm okay
[22:00:00] <shakygator> its basically just consultants who dont work for you
[22:00:03] <sd> 13<sâ€‹ea> Sounds like cancer
[22:00:06] <sd> 07<Qâ€‹uantumFoam> I'm serious, stop and think about this for a minute
[22:00:09] <sd> 13<sâ€‹ea> I just want one company
[22:00:11] <shakygator> who come in, destroy your GPOs, and charge you a bunch to do it
[22:00:15] <sd> 13<sâ€‹ea> lol
[22:00:17] <sd> 07<Qâ€‹uantumFoam> If Windows didn't fucking break so much a lot of us wouldn't even have jobs
[22:00:24] <sd> 13<sâ€‹ea> True
[22:00:27] <sd> 13<sâ€‹ea> But the thing is
[22:00:28] <shakygator> thats all thinsg
[22:00:29] <sd> 13<Câ€‹olour> What who the hell broke your GPOs
[22:00:30] <sd> 13<sâ€‹ea> Idk how to fix Windows
[22:00:33] <shakygator> if cars didnt break mechanics wouldnt have jobs
[22:00:34] <sd> 13<sâ€‹ea> Who wants to fix windows
[22:00:38] <shakygator> if pipes didnt break, plumbers wouldnt have jobs
[22:00:39] <sd> 13<sâ€‹ea> good logic lol
[22:00:40] <sd> 07<Qâ€‹uantumFoam> Microsoft does, actually
[22:00:46] <sd> 07<Qâ€‹uantumFoam> that's one of the goals with Windows265
[22:00:47] <sd> 02<râ€‹xxt> fact
[22:00:49] <sd> 13<Câ€‹olour> MSPs don't just fix broken things they can set up stuff too so
[22:01:02] <sd> 02<râ€‹xxt> imagine if PCs wouldnt break
[22:01:07] <shakygator> consultants suck, change my mind
[22:01:12] <sd> 13<sâ€‹ea> Windows 364+1/4
[22:01:16] <shakygator> they can be good for a very specific task
[22:01:19] <sd> 13<Câ€‹olour> MSPs come in, ask you why you're using POP3 emails on Windows 7 Home and try to get you an AD Domain, o365, Windows 10 Pro, other bits.
[22:01:21] <shakygator> like migrating a domain
[22:01:24] <sd> 07<Qâ€‹uantumFoam> shakygator: highly dependent on the field
[22:01:27] <sd> 13<sâ€‹ea> consultants suck dick
[22:01:39] <sd> 07<Qâ€‹uantumFoam> Microsoft consultants? Yes, you're frequently correct.
[22:01:48] <sd> 13<sâ€‹ea> ok affirmed my assumption
[22:01:58] <shakygator> this one time we paid this guy like 3500 to come in and watch me migrate from sbs 2011 to 2k12 vanilla ad
[22:02:01] <sd> 13<Câ€‹olour> MSPs can be good and tbh I should start one myself as a side thing.
[22:02:04] <sd> 07<Qâ€‹uantumFoam> Like that time that a former employer paid quite a bit to have MS come out and troubleshoot an Exchange server
[22:02:13] <sd> 07<Qâ€‹uantumFoam> And I overheard the conversation because it was one cube over
[22:02:27] <sd> 13<Câ€‹olour> Haha Shakygator that's funny, the MSP I was at would do far more for far less
[22:02:46] <sd> 07<Qâ€‹uantumFoam> And then I go look at the VMWare machine it's on and discover they've vastly overprovisioned CPU and were just throwing more cores at the server which was making it WORSE
[22:02:55] <sd> 13<Câ€‹olour> Psshhh
[22:02:57] <shakygator> @Colour - i asked the guy a question and he was like idk you know more about this than me
[22:03:00] <sd> 07<Qâ€‹uantumFoam> So I vMotioned it to another server in the cluster that actually had room
[22:03:04] <sd> 13<Câ€‹olour> Sounds about right shakygator
[22:03:05] <shakygator> and i was getting paid like 15/hour to do this
[22:03:07] <sd> 07<Qâ€‹uantumFoam> And behold, Exchange stopped shitting itself
[22:03:19] <sd> 07<Qâ€‹uantumFoam> Shoulda got a fucking bonus for that shit...
[22:03:22] <sd> 13<Câ€‹olour> Yeah that's what happens MSPs pay shitty but they throw inexperienced low paid guys at projects
[22:03:22] <fuhry> msps can actually be good
[22:03:33] <sd> 13<Câ€‹olour> They CAN be I GUESS
[22:03:37] <shakygator> anything can be good
[22:03:41] <fuhry> i worked for channel companies for a long time (datto and zorus) and there were some genuinely good ones
[22:03:52] <sd> 07<Qâ€‹uantumFoam> heroin can be really, really good
[22:03:54] <sd> 07<Qâ€‹uantumFoam> ...ONCE
[22:03:56] <shakygator> i knew a guy at datto
[22:03:57] <sd> 13<Câ€‹olour> Hahaa
[22:04:57] <sd> 13<Câ€‹olour> I got to write down on my CV that I had domain migration xp, o365 and full small company migration xp, whole network refresh xp, tons of stuff that makes me look good.
[22:05:06] <fuhry> i was at datto from 2011-2018 and contributed a ton of code to early versions of many of their products (the storagecraft based version of siris, cloud and hybrid virtualization, siris agent encryption, the dna router)
[22:05:12] <sd> 13<Câ€‹olour> It helped me get experience I guess
[22:05:33] <JollyRgrs> MSFT is not a VM consultancy, they were troubleshooting the OS/Software, not the VM infra itself
[22:05:45] <JollyRgrs> that's not up to MSFT to know if the host is overprovisioning
[22:06:03] <sd> 07<Qâ€‹uantumFoam> Yes it is, Microsoft absolutely cooperates with VMWare to identify issues like this
[22:06:03] <fuhry> but yeah, MSPs can be competent, there were also plenty that were such a pain in the ass that they became household names among the support team
[22:06:27] <sd> 07<Qâ€‹uantumFoam> And as soon as I said that it was overprovisioned the MS consultant asked why they were not told that to start with
[22:06:35] <JollyRgrs> if you ask MSFT for help on an exchange issue, they'll work on your exchange issue and maybe the OS if they spot issues there
[22:06:37] <JollyRgrs> right
[22:06:45] <JollyRgrs> that's what I mean, it isn't their job to know if it is overprovisioned
[22:07:14] <sd> 07<Qâ€‹uantumFoam> No, but it is their job to say "there's nothing wrong here that I can see, have you looked at the underlying infrastructure?"
[22:07:35] <JollyRgrs> ofc
[22:07:53] <JollyRgrs> but it can take quite a bit of time to get to that point
[22:08:05] <sd> 07<Qâ€‹uantumFoam> Not take you for a fucking ride at however many hundreds of dollars an hour that farce worked out to
[22:08:53] <JollyRgrs> lol
[22:09:29] <fuhry> but they make both exchange and the OS. That means the exchange server installer should configure the OS properly for being an email server... scheduling policies, network stack tweaks, all that. and it should check the OS when the service starts and let you know if something is getting in the way of it working as it should
[22:09:29] <JollyRgrs> hindsight (and being on the other side of the support call) is 20/20
[22:10:00] <JollyRgrs> fuhry: most of those "tweaks" aren't needed unless something comes up
[22:10:13] <JollyRgrs> best not to tweak stuff until it needs tweaking, less you cause other issues
[22:10:44] <JollyRgrs> and yes, you should probably only be running exchange on a server (and no other services)... but I can tell you that isn't always the case
[22:10:47] <sd> 07<Qâ€‹uantumFoam> fuhry: essentially what was happening in that case was the hypervisor didn't have enough CPU credits to give to the Exchange server as provisioned because of other servers on that cluster node that were also very active; this was causing Exchange to be extremely slow or even crash Outlook but without producing any useful log activity
[22:11:01] <sd> 07<Qâ€‹uantumFoam> literally no one even looked at the cluster node before calling Microsoft
[22:11:18] <fuhry> JollyRgrs: oh I know, hardware and electricity are not cheap
[22:11:21] <sd> 07<Qâ€‹uantumFoam> they just assumed Exchange itself was fucked somehow and they needed help to un-fuck it
[22:11:45] <sd> 07<Qâ€‹uantumFoam> so I overheard "we gave it more cores, why is it still slow?" and was like
[22:11:48] <sd> 07<Qâ€‹uantumFoam> B R U H
[22:12:03] <fuhry> haha
[22:12:11] <fuhry> no more cores to give bruh
[22:12:25] <sd> 07<Qâ€‹uantumFoam> oh I shamed them
[22:12:31] <sd> 07<Qâ€‹uantumFoam> I made them come over to my desk and watch me fix it
[22:12:48] <sd> 07<Qâ€‹uantumFoam> there was a lot of profanity afterwards
