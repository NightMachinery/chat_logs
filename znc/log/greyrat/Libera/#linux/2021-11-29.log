[01:46:09] <SysGhost> I tend to get the feeling that Linus is well versed in the Windows world, but not with hardware as much. As someone here earlier said, quoting: "Being good at Windows is not the same as being good with computers in general".
[01:46:14] <EtherMan> They're doing as well as expected really. Remember that Linus is a complete noob when it comes to linux stuff. That's really Andrew's domain and Linus himself barely knows enough to run commands on their unraid server as they're given to him by unraid themselves.

[01:48:20] <EtherMan> jcbjoe2021: Depends on what kind of support you're looking for in my experience. Debian's community is in my experience more friendly towards helping even if you don't use the official repos, whereas Ubuntus support just completely shuts down as soon as ANYTHING on your system, regardless if it has any relation to the issue is using any external repo or anything like that.
[01:48:57] <maxzor> there is official Ubuntu support?
[01:49:10] <EtherMan> And that debian's packages are old. In Stable, they often are. They're there because they're stable, not new. The same is generally true for Ubuntu as well.
[01:49:27] <maxzor> my personal Ubuntu support is IRC and stack exchange
[01:49:38] <EtherMan> maxzor: Sure there is. The official community support channel is #ubuntu here on Libera even.
[01:49:51] <Sauvin> As I understand it, Ubuntu uses Debian's testing branch(es), so Ubuntu packages will tend to be a bit less old.

[03:00:17] <Wafficus> which, by the way, was pretty awesome for the homebrew community
[03:00:18] <O0c> I've tried before. It refused to run in a virtualmachine.
[03:00:21] <doc> ok, so with pulseaudio system wide and the same result in the logs, anyone got any other suggestions? :/
[03:00:44] <xx> and be damn sure you replace the X with the correct letter
[03:00:54] <gry> O0c: so you might end up installing windows on a usb, if it supports that, though i don't know how that works with the boot manager
[03:01:01] <doc> wait, I also have a /usr/bin/pulseaudio running as me. Damn it!
[03:01:14] <Wafficus> ran that command: sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb bs=1M count=10 conv=fsync

[03:02:44] <xx> it writes 10MB of zeros to the start of the drive, thus erasing all the partition information and other messy stuff
[03:02:48] <Wafficus> O0c I installed Windows 10 recently via USB, you can get the ISO directly from Microsoft, its really easy
[03:03:08] <Wafficus> plus you can totally ignore the constant hassle to upgrade your license. The only thing it doesn't allow you to do is to change your wallpaper, that's it

[07:05:40] <sysRPL> but when i do the same thing in windows the sound is clear

[07:06:09] <bparker> also windows could be applying noise cancellation
[07:06:21] <Sauvin> ayecee, alternative interpretations are less generous.
[07:06:26] <sysRPL> also, min automatically adjusts the microphone input volume. it can't be set manually
[07:06:27] <ionface> sysRPL, I mean, you have a bevy of professional audio production tools with jack, but it could be a problem with your kernel or something idk, it's something to trouble-shoot for sure

[08:43:41] <Sauvin> THAT might need some different tooling.

[09:49:10] <namkeleser> sounds a bit wrong to me. if i try to do it from the dashboard itself, it says user can only be managed by cpconfig

[12:57:46] <tlf> I'm having trouble with a file with encoding type "unknown-8bit" (according to file -i). It's the output of my script. The script lloops through entries in an RSS feed and concatenates the results to the file. I can see that each loop results in different encoding (utf8, us-ascii and Iso-8859-1. Is this "mixture" causing the issue?
[12:58:12] <tlf> My code doesn't actually deal with encoding.

[13:00:57] <hexnewbie> in chardet, ascii <= utf8 (so you can treat them the same), and latin1/iso-8859-1 is bad news (non-utf8 data detected, you can't be sure it got the right encoding)

[14:25:02] <Sauvin> Looks to me like the Freenode nonsense started about 27 weeks and 5 days ago.
[14:25:04] <jim> so why even give freenode a second thought? whether they're alive or dead, we're alive, and not under korean control
[14:25:29] <binaryhermit> has it been that long Sauvin
[14:26:00] <binaryhermit> it doesn't seem that long, but on the other hand, COVID's messed up all normal sense of time flow
[14:26:04] <Sauvin> Korea doesn't care one way or another. Forget Lee's nationality or ethnicity or whatever, we're live and not under the control of a delusional crackheaded megalomaniacal idiot.
[14:26:29] <binaryhermit> it has more to do with him thinking he's the emperor of korea, which isn't a thing

[16:47:16] <hexnewbie> pagios: That's need the CA to be trusted, not the certificate signed by the CA
[16:47:18] <Blondie101010> it will remain self-signed unless you make a CA
[16:47:50] <pagios> hexnewbie: the CA is in active directory
[16:47:59] <pagios> so i used it to sign a certificate for this linux machine
[16:48:06] <Blondie101010> considering that a domain name costs less than 15$ per year and SSL can be free, that'd be a waste of time in most cases

[16:48:52] <spyroboy> fair enough.

[16:50:21] <pagios> not true

[16:50:51] <hexnewbie> pagios: In theory, the way you've been doing it for the certificate signed by the CA. HOWEVER, in practice, unless you are making your own CA (I gather you are NOT, from what you've shared), one would first investigate why that third party CA is not trusted in the first place. I wouldn't trust a random third party my distro decided not to trust
[16:51:24] <Blondie101010> I think he said it's self-signed
[16:51:32] <hexnewbie> ‘signed by a third party ca’
[16:51:33] <pagios> hexnewbie: the server is in the same network of the CA-server running windows AD and CA
[16:51:38] <pagios> its my own CA
[16:51:42] <pagios> but on windows
[16:51:51] <hexnewbie> Er, ‘a ca certificte generated by third party ca’, which makes little sense
[16:51:51] <Blondie101010> that's fine, so then you need to trust that CA

[23:26:40] <kurahaupo> Terminals have an implicit model of 1 character = 1 cell. Later "wide" characters were allowed to occupy two cells. But zero-width characters (such as combining diacritics) are still problematic.

[23:42:03] <hingoanashi1209> you folks are asking all the right questions, but no luck yet
[23:42:29] <pyeverything> hello our system has slowed down severely to the point that $ ls barely works. So, we have 128GB of memory, and we are not sure if our system can be upgraded to 256. So my questions are: 1. what is the immediate things we could do to figure what the actual problems are? we cannot restart now since we have a long running job that would finish in 2 days. 2. how can I know if our system RAM could be upgraded to 256G? Here's some stats and we have an
[23:42:29] <pyeverything> uptime of 19 days and 24 CPUs https://pastebin.com/raw/1q82b5ts

[23:43:26] <hingoanashi1209> ?
[23:43:36] <xx> pyeverything: sounds like the system is simply under heavy load, so it is expected that `ls` barely works
[23:44:34] *** Joins: Dill (~Dill@199.185.67.200)
[23:44:35] <pyeverything> xx so do you think upgrading the RAM to 256 might solve this problem? or is it possible the system is not upgradable? it is 3 years old

[23:45:56] <pyeverything> so what is causing it? we never had this problem
[23:45:58] <hingoanashi1209> would you mind telling me anything else about your system that could conceivably make a difference that I could try copying?
[23:46:12] <xx> pyeverything: my bet would be reading/writing to disk a lot
