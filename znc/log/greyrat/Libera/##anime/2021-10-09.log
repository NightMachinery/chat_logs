[00:11:47] <wootehfoot> is the trailer dubbed?
[00:13:04] <MootPoot> In the future when everything is 2d, we will go on tinder 2142 and ask who animated your model
[00:13:24] <lastonestanding> or grindr
[00:14:41] <lastonestanding> will the future be dominated by gays? it appears that more and more people turn to the gay side
[00:16:13] <kariosfox> idk.
[00:17:47] <kariosfox> I mean if you keep thinking there's loads of yellow cars everywhere, wherever you look, you'll see yellow cars.
[00:18:53] <kariosfox> it's a self-fulfilling prophecy
[00:19:36] <kariosfox> MootPoot: why would everythign be 2d all of a sudden? 
[00:21:08] <SpiritOfSummer> I'm a little bit pissed off that they tried a CGI animation style for the movie
[00:21:14] <SpiritOfSummer> DBS Broly had the perfect animation style
[00:21:21] <SpiritOfSummer> it was like a remastered Dragon Ball Z
[00:22:59] <MootPoot> kariosfox: I did say in the future

[00:23:18] <MootPoot> and we all connect into a giant computer
[00:23:33] <MootPoot> and become vtubers
[00:24:02] <MootPoot> we will be born, and have until the age of 50 to make a choice to be digitized or not
[00:24:09] <wootehfoot> CGI animation is cheaper to produce, but dick move regardless
[00:27:16] <wootehfoot> MootPoot, more like we will have until 10 to prove we have the intelligence to live until 15, morale to live until 30, then will to live until 150 regardless of digitization

[03:55:36] <sentionics> thanks for putting up with my madness, MoodPoot
[03:55:38] <MootPoot> this is ##anime
[03:55:55] <sentionics> I love your MoodPoot: as a sibling
[03:56:02] <sentionics> seriously, you are close to me
[03:56:32] <sentionics> I hope I am close to you (not a fuck-mate, but close)
[03:57:05] <sentionics> MootPoot: I see you as a serious sibling, though we haven't met.
[03:57:17] <sentionics> *met in person
[03:58:51] <MootPoot> thanks
[04:09:23] <snake> how do you guys hear about new animes to watch?
[04:09:35] <snake> and find ones that are good and interesting
[04:10:09] <sentionics> snake: best place to check is nyaa.si and subsplease
[04:10:23] <sentionics> sorry my spelling is fail
[04:10:28] <snake> sentionics, its just a torrent site tho
[04:10:38] <snake> and i dont read japanese
[04:10:47] <sentionics> if you don't torrent, you are lost hre
[04:10:47] <MootPoot> step 1.) go to MAL 2.) look up all the current seasons anime 3.) download ep 1 and 2 of all of them 4.) try them all out and see which ones you like
[04:10:48] <snake> its like a long stream of content
[04:10:49] <sentionics> *here
[04:10:57] <Nanobot> MC is reincarnated in another world as a speck of dust. It just so happens that the speck of dust makes its way into a pendant that is acquired by a beautiful female adventurer, and MC finds that he can telepathically communicate with her while she's wearing it. Also, she can transfer full control over her body to MC whenever she wants, which she tends to do whenever she's in a situation that she just doesn't want to deal with.
[04:11:01] <MootPoot> Other people do it differently
[04:11:12] <sentionics> I don't understant other ppl
[04:11:25] <MootPoot> lol, we're finally back to Nanobot's LN plots
[04:11:28] <MootPoot> I missed em
[04:11:55] <sentionics> MootPoot: I love you mate
[04:12:36] <sentionics> ugh, my thing is, people establish things. They say it's the standard
[04:12:54] <sentionics> from a coder's perspective, stop changing your minds, gods
[04:13:14] <Nanobot> Me: "Oh man, I'm 42 minutes late to the HoloEN collab." *clicks into the video* "Started streaming 19 minutes ago." Me: "Thank you, EN curse!"
[04:13:16] <sentionics> anyway, there's always a python lib that covers it
[04:13:55] <snake> Nanobot, i found out that canvases can be recorded in the web browser but i don't have the energy to sort all the code out right now and i got an extension that does it
[04:13:56] <sentionics> Nanobot: I think I missed your point. Help me understand.
[04:14:20] <sentionics> snake! snaaaaake. sorry I disappointed you in the past, snake.
[04:14:44] * snake hands sentionics some water
[04:14:50] <snake> go get some water
[04:14:52] <Nanobot> sentionics: I thought I was way late to the stream. However, HoloEN tends to have technical issues a lot (which is usually referred to as the "EN curse"), which means the stream was delayed and I'm not nearly as late as I thought.

[17:02:34] <emmeka> I submit that Canadian Thanksgiving is the best holiday of the year. For one, it involves no gift giving. You just make and eat a lot of food. Two, it's secular, and doesn't have the weird genocide-y history of American Thanksgiving. Three, it's actually on a Monday, unlike weird American Thanksgiving which is on a Thursday, so it makes a real long weekend.
[17:02:44] <amigojapan> Hay Berlin36 
[17:03:15] <Berlin36> how are you
[17:03:24] <darkwitch> thanksgiving is one of the holidays they didn't manage to export with much success to the rest of the world

[17:38:47] <Bco1981> thanks
[17:39:03] <Sadale> Bco1981, I mean other people have got it working with RTX. So you should be able to do the same with the right equipment and the right software.
[17:39:27] <Bco1981> yeah, but most of them use rift "S"
[17:39:32] <Bco1981> not the CV1 like i have
[17:39:35] <Sadale> oh
[17:39:43] <darkwitch> amigojapan, it can be anything, including food. but it's mainly for your own memory. it's not a gift you give away, although that is of course possible, but not what souvenir is about
[17:40:22] <Sadale> Bco1981, speaking of VR I'm thinking if those smartphone VR thingie is any good. Apparently it's dirt cheap.
[17:40:33] <Cryowolf> I'm desperately trying to learn some basic Unity scripting to make a new item for Valheim :P
[17:40:49] <amigojapan> darkwitch: these were mainly gifts for seeing me in person

[20:57:06] <MootPoot> what headset 
[20:57:10] <Bco1981> CV1
[20:57:13] <MootPoot> and can it maintain 90fps
[20:57:17] <MootPoot> hmmm
[20:57:20] <Bco1981> oh yes
[20:57:36] <MootPoot> with a quest 2 I wonder how much I'll have to nerf the resolution
[20:57:36] *** Quits: digin4 (~digin4@user/digin4) (Quit: Leaving)
[20:58:45] <Bco1981> i didn't nerf the oculus resolution, but the game window to 720p
[20:59:08] <Bco1981> but according to msi afterburner i think i should be able to run 1080p
[20:59:09] <MootPoot> I wonder if 2gb vram can pull it off
[20:59:24] <Bco1981> ah... i didn't check that
[21:03:08] <MootPoot> I guess I have a 1050 ti laptop as well
[21:03:17] <MootPoot> but its not really mine lul
[21:07:41] <MootPoot> I feel like I dont know about electricity to be trusted to do things with anything more then 12v
[21:13:53] <Bco1981> the other problem might be... does those laptops have 16gb ram ?

[21:18:30] <Bco1981> i have a core2quad that has a gtx 960 in it... i'm tempted to try out vr on it
[21:18:49] <Bco1981> last time it couldn't because it had a gtx 560-ti
[21:18:56] <Bco1981> and oculus software said no.
[21:21:07] <MootPoot> I had a interesting problem
[21:21:24] <MootPoot> apparently I can run the quest 2 at 120hz and max res
[21:21:38] <MootPoot> if I use the oculux xr software 
[21:21:47] <MootPoot> if I rely on steam then its a shitfest
[21:22:01] <MootPoot> but then I have to manually add the games to the oculus launcher
[21:22:25] <MootPoot> I need a stronger gpu
[21:22:37] <Bco1981> 3080 isn't enough ?
[21:22:49] <MootPoot> for most games yes, but for others no
[21:22:59] <MootPoot> I'm not sure if its the cable bandwidth or the 3080
[21:23:03] <Bco1981> lower settings
[21:23:16] <MootPoot> Id like to but I cant
[21:23:29] <MootPoot> would be easy if I could change the settings from within the headset
[21:23:32] <MootPoot> for render resolution
[21:23:48] <MootPoot> or lock it per game -> this game runs in 120fps and max res
[21:23:59] <MootPoot> this game runs at 90 and 3/4 res
[21:24:10] <MootPoot> but you have to restart the whole contraption
[21:24:11] <Bco1981> i was thinking the game quality, then the game won't be as heavy for the 3080 and it should be able to keep up with the 120hz/fps
[21:24:12] <MootPoot> its annoying
[21:24:48] <MootPoot> hmm
[21:24:53] <MootPoot> maybe I'll try that
[21:25:01] <MootPoot> instead of messing with oculus settings
[21:27:19] <Vohveli> lastonestanding: nope
