[13:50:55] <serafeim> this is not something i would suggest
[13:57:50] <mad_moses> because?
[13:58:17] <serafeim> because this is not something secure
[13:58:36] <serafeim> there are other methods for authenticating api calls
[13:58:39] <serafeim> not using the session cookie
[14:00:15] <mad_moses> serafeim: I am using thoken auth to authenticate agains my rest api. And after this authentication I would like to have a method to get a session cookie returned. Why this is unsafe?
[14:00:44] <serafeim> because this is not the job of the the session cookie
[14:03:36] <mad_moses> serafeim: this is the default bevior of django? I do not undestand why it is unsafe or why it is not the job of the session cookie?
[14:05:23] <serafeim> you are doing fancy security things.
[14:05:30] <serafeim> fancy security is not something you should use
[14:07:11] <mad_moses> serafeim: can you give me a reason? Every default django website is using session authentication? Can you give me a reason why it is not safe?
[14:07:30] <serafeim> yes but you are passing the session cookie through an api call ?
[14:07:51] <serafeim> you don't use the session cookie as intended.
[14:07:54] <serafeim> that's what's fancy
[14:08:41] *** Quits: lazzurs (~lazzurs@user/lazzurs) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[14:08:51] <mad_moses> serafeim: In my android app I have some sections in my application which use a webview. It is like a browser. Why not use session cookie for that? What authentication scheme should I use? token auth is not working. (At least not out of the box=
[14:09:10] <serafeim> you see.
[14:09:28] <serafeim> you have an android app./
[14:09:34] <serafeim> and you want to use session cookie for that.
[14:09:39] <serafeim> this is *not* the correct thing to do
[14:10:10] <serafeim> so either you won't be able to do it at all, or it will be too much pain to implement it, or it will be implemented but will have a security hole.
[14:10:42] <serafeim> use token authentication or jwt or even good old basic http auth through https. but use something that is *intented* for this kind of usage
[14:10:43] <mad_moses> Okay, I undestand that this is your opinion. But a lot of apps use session cookies
[14:10:58] <serafeim> mad_moses: ok then be my guest
[14:11:17] <serafeim> i don't have anything else to say about the subject nor i want to convince you otherwise
[14:13:38] <mad_moses> serafeim: even the default in DRF is session authentication: https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/authentication/#setting-the-authentication-scheme
[14:13:55] <serafeim> it's a different thing
[14:14:28] <serafeim> i am always using session authnetication for DRF. but *only* on my web apps.
[14:14:50] <serafeim> which login the user normally
[14:15:34] <ktosiek> Which is literally what the docs say it's meant for: "This authentication scheme uses Django's default session backend for authentication. Session authentication is appropriate for AJAX clients that are running in the same session context as your website"
[14:16:29] <mad_moses> If I run a webview on android it is the same as I am navigating with my browser to my website.
[14:16:47] <serafeim> mad_moses: yes. but you must login the user *through* that webview.
[14:17:04] <serafeim> and see if the session cookie is stored properly
[14:17:42] <mad_moses> But let's assume this is a security hole. I don't care :=) How can I generate this session cookie? I could also write a view and pass my token as a get paramter and login the user. Wouldn't be this the same?
[14:18:46] <serafeim> can't help you. why don't you use token authentication ?
[14:19:10] <mad_moses> serafeim: How can I use thken auth with my browser?
[14:19:46] <serafeim> https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/authentication/#tokenauthentication
[14:20:11] <serafeim> it's really simple. create tokens for your users and pass the token to an Authentication: header
[14:20:19] <serafeim> oops. Authorization header
[14:20:45] <mad_moses> serafeim: this is not working in the browser. It works only on rest endpoint.
[14:21:06] <mad_moses> serafeim: If i use curl and try to load my root page of my website with the header I am not logged in.
[14:21:19] <mad_moses> serafeim: this works only on rest calls
[14:21:26] <serafeim> yes. what did you expect ?
[14:22:13] <mad_moses> serafeim: I have a webview (Which bahaves like a browser). If I navigate to www.mywebsite.com/loginarea/ then I am not logged id.
[14:22:29] <serafeim> so the webview *does not* behave like a browser
[14:22:35] <mad_moses> serafeim: why not?
[14:22:43] <serafeim> don't even know what a webview is
[14:22:54] <mad_moses> It is a browser.
[14:22:56] <serafeim> or maybe it needs some extra configuration to keep the session
[14:23:04] <serafeim> i don't know about that thingie
[14:23:28] <ktosiek> Hmm, but WebView is a bit of a strange beast. You would probably want to use a cookie there, or use some kind of request filtering to add the token
[14:23:43] <serafeim> this https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64200301/how-to-maintain-session-in-webview-after-exiting-the-application-in-android ?
[14:24:01] <serafeim> or this https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59332294/session-not-working-in-webview-in-android ?
[14:24:10] <serafeim> it seems that the webview does not support cookies by default
[14:24:12] <serafeim> so ...
[14:24:18] <mad_moses> forget about the webview. It works perfectly with the session cookie. If I enter it manually from my normal browser everything works fine
[14:24:23] <mad_moses> I just need to create this sessiondi
[14:24:28] <mad_moses> this is my probelm
[14:24:57] <mad_moses> Lets't don't talk about the webview. This is not the problem. Just assume I use firefox
[14:25:12] <mad_moses> you can not use with firefox token auth on normal views
[14:25:15] <serafeim> if you use firefox you'd be able to login, wouldn't you ?
[14:25:57] <mad_moses> serafeim: I can, I can also use the webview to login. But I am allready logged in over token auth. I just need to create a session cookie on some point.
[14:26:02] <ktosiek> I think it's about avoiding logging in twice, once through the app and then through the WebView
[14:26:07] <mad_moses> yes
[14:26:22] <mad_moses> ktosiek: thats what i am trying to say
[14:26:44] <serafeim> mad_moses: and i've already told you that this is not the correct thing to do.
[14:27:01] <serafeim> i don't even know if it's possible but even if it *was* possible i wouldn't recommend doing it
[14:27:06] <mad_moses> serafeim: I don't care. Just want to know how to creat a session cookie.
[14:27:10] <mad_moses> serafeim: it is possible.
[14:27:18] <serafeim> well ok i can't help you.
[14:27:33] <mad_moses> ktosiek: do you have an idea?
[14:28:15] <ktosiek> I think the best way would be to intercept requests from the WebView and add some Authorization header.
[14:28:42] <ktosiek> But if you really need to know how the session cookie gets created you should look inside SessionMiddleware

[14:54:03] <mad_moses> ktosiek: request.session.session_key
[14:59:07] <mad_moses> tested and it works perfectly
[14:59:07] <mad_moses> https://dpaste.org/tFky
[14:59:23] <mad_moses> ktosiek: do you think this is generating any kind of security hole?
[15:00:39] <ktosiek> that login() looks fishy, isn't there a session already available on the request?
[15:00:43] <ktosiek> oh, it's a DRF request
[15:04:23] <mad_moses> ktosiek: exactly. This was all the time my problem
[15:04:34] <mad_moses> without the login it does not wor
[15:04:35] <mad_moses> k
[15:05:23] <ktosiek> no idea about security, it looks ok as it's already an authenticated request and you're only logging in the current request.user
[15:05:25] <ktosiek> OHHH
[15:06:21] <ktosiek> nah, nevermind. But I wonder if it should be a GET
[15:06:43] <mad_moses> ktosiek: why not?
[15:07:18] <moldy> security-wise it looks ok to me, not sure about CSRF..
[15:07:25] <ktosiek> I wonder how it would work with CORS
[15:08:02] <ktosiek> this should never be available through CORS, as it would enable stealing the session cookie
[15:08:53] *** Joins: Ergo^ (~ergo@91.238.59.144)
[15:10:00] <ktosiek> (I mean, a client allowed to use authenticated CORS would be able to grab the actual session cookie - and could skip all CORS restrictions since then)
[15:12:40] <mad_moses> ktosiek: how can it skip all CORS restrictions? CORS are still available for all other normal views?
[15:12:47] *** Quits: Haudegen (~quassel@178.115.237.87.static.drei.at) (Quit: Bin weg.)
[15:14:18] <mad_moses> ktosiek: and how can it be stolen without having the token?
[15:16:02] <mad_moses> Wait, you are right. I have to disable session authentication for this view. So it can't be stolen
[15:16:03] <ktosiek> mad_moses: another site allowed by CORS to make authenticated (aka "using user's cookie for your API") requests could use this endpoint to access the actual cookie value - something that should not be available even for sites allowed by CORS
[15:16:25] <ktosiek> or at least cookie authentication, yeah
[15:17:39] <mad_moses> ktosiek: how would you implement this? I could just check if the call has cookie with a sessionid. if yesk, i will not return the sessionid
[15:21:01] <ktosiek> Good question. I'd try doing a positive check, like setting authentication_classes and permission_classes on the view
[15:23:24] <mad_moses> ktosiek: I just block all cookies. https://dpaste.org/Kdhh This view should never be run by any browser at all.
[15:24:23] <ktosiek> that might work, but you won't remember about this when you are adding a new authentication method :-P
[15:26:42] <mad_moses> ktosiek: maybe you a right. But I think in the near feature our android app will move away from token auth and will use session auth from the beginning.

[19:38:24] <GinFuyou> pretty sure celery doesn't make database tables, it must be some additional helper lib
[19:38:52] <moldy> it will if you use the django result backend i think
[19:39:13] <kerouac> result and celery beat, yes
[19:40:47] <GinFuyou> is not it a separate lib? Or was it included?
[19:43:43] <kerouac> well, in requirement.txt i have only `celery==5.1.2`
[19:43:48] <kerouac> and I have tables in db
[19:43:59] <kerouac> probably it's the only way to use celery in django
[19:45:02] <moldy> at some point they includes the django result backend in the main package, iirc
