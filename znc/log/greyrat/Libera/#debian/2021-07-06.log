[03:34:34] <brownorange> im' not positive but i think when i unplug my network shutdown is faster

[04:02:33] <brownorange> that means debian came that way or one of the loggers i installed turned it off for no good reason. just great

[04:05:35] <PMT> That's odd. I do remember once adjusting a system to persist journald, but I don't think that was Debian, and my recent Debian installs have not required such.
[04:08:43] <quadrat> PMT buster journal is not persistant, only with bullseye it's going to change
[04:09:36] <PMT> quadrat: interesting, I must have only checked that on non-buster installs. That seems an odd default.

[12:01:12] <PMT> hello
[12:02:08] <markand> at work we're using iEi devices (sort of all in one touch panel PC) since a decade, but for some reason one of our new arrival no longer boots and get stuck like this: https://imgur.com/a/757vuqn
[12:02:31] <markand> the very last time I saw a kernel stuck like this was in 2003 so I'm quite surprised to see this today and unable to find a workaround
[12:02:55] <PMT> What version of Debian do they run?
[12:03:06] <markand> what's more surprising is that if I press the power button now, it kernel panics immediately
[12:03:13] <markand> we have tried both 9 and 10 
[12:03:16] <markand> amd64 
[12:03:24] <PMT> Do you have an image of the panic?

[12:19:06] <markand> the BIOS is configurable to emulate old ata or use AHCI
[12:19:08] <markand> also tried both
[12:20:07] <PMT> Going to interpret that as IDE emulation, probably.

[12:25:02] <PMT> that actually seems like it might continue, from that limited output - panics are not known for continuing output afterward, but there are other ways to trigger a calltrace 
[12:26:37] <markand> okay we booted it without the internal disk without issue
[12:26:39] <markand> good catch PMT 
[12:26:57] <PMT> I live to serve.
[12:28:06] <shtrb> So it was a bad device in the end ? 
[12:28:59] <markand> dunno, we have a bunch of different (it's m.2 drives, I'm actually opening it to replace it)
[12:29:53] <shtrb> let me get that straight, an m.2 devices is connected via an emulator to IDE ? 
[12:30:25] <PMT> I think you're confusing "BIOS has IDE emulation mode" with "using IDE connector on board"
[12:32:19] <markand> there are no IDE connector on that board
[12:32:31] <markand> but I remember there was an option to select AHCI and not-AHCI

[14:07:02] <jhutchins> good grief.  Who do you think is attacking you?\
[14:07:47] <PMT> Just having an open sshd will accumulate a fair number of people poking around.
[14:08:49] <jhutchins> PMT: Uh, no.  No purpose.
[14:10:21] <PMT> My auth.log disagrees.
[14:10:24] <jhutchins> Imaginary security.
[14:11:55] <PMT> I can see arguing that it's guarding against nothing, but arguing that it provides no functionality doesn't follow, for me.
[14:12:04] <jhutchins> If you're running ssh on 22 it's your own fault.
[14:12:05] <ratrace> I can agree that real danger comes from distributed attempts against which fail2ban is useless, but it's not useless for certain use cases where that's not the thing
[14:12:41] <jor> yeah, for me not much to do with security. it's bandwith limiting, quickly blackholing ssh attempts can save quite a bit of network traffic :)
[14:12:59] <ratrace> for example I find it very useful for email servers. blacklisting IPs that are repeated offenders is making logs quieter, and is reducing the possibility for them to inject a spam here or there, that failed to be detected

[17:14:18] <wyre> quadrat, awesome, that's what I was looking for 😁
[17:15:04] *** Joins: jess (~jess@libera/staff/jess)
[17:15:27] <amacater> wyre: That will stop anyone ever logging in as root unless in sudo - but you will have problems if you're ever dropped into single user mode as quadrat pointed out.
[17:16:27] <wyre> amacater, apparently when you are dropped into single user mode you are already logged as root, right? 
[17:16:44] <amacater> You may have to give the root password to continue
[17:16:46] *** Joins: milkt_ (~debian@gateway/tor-sasl/milkt)
[17:16:53] <quadrat> wyre no you would still need to input root pw, which doesn't exist
[17:16:59] <quadrat> so the only way is a live usb
[17:17:01] <poko|work> single-user mode is not root by default, i thought?
[17:17:24] <wyre> oh, I see, so the only way is with chroot
[17:17:28] <quadrat> yes
[17:17:35] *** Quits: milkt_ (~debian@gateway/tor-sasl/milkt) (Client Quit)
[17:17:54] <quadrat> i rather have a harder way to recover, than a password on root, which could be bruteforced. i can live with that
[17:17:56] *** Joins: milkt_ (~debian@gateway/tor-sasl/milkt)
[17:17:59] <wyre> but this is the same when the password has expired (-l)
[17:18:47] *** Quits: milkt (~debian@gateway/tor-sasl/milkt) (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
[17:19:28] <quadrat> This option disables a password by changing it to a value which matches no possible encrypted value
[17:19:35] <quadrat> so how would you do that? ;)
[17:19:58] <amacater> Typically - you _REALLY_ need root when a sysadmin/colleague has left and no longer has an account. If (s)he is the only one in sudoers, it's interesting :)
[17:20:12] *** Quits: milkt_ (~debian@gateway/tor-sasl/milkt) (Client Quit)
[17:20:25] <wyre> so regarding this scenario (when you are dropped into single user mode) both situations are pretty the same (-d and -l, I mean)
[17:21:21] <quadrat> amacater this is where i wouldn't care about the 5 mins i would need to chroot (i mean i guess it depends on how many machines we are talking about)
[17:21:36] *** Joins: milkt (~debian@gateway/tor-sasl/milkt)
[17:23:35] <quadrat> but when you are in a situation where you don't have root (sudo) access to the systems, then the 'takeover' after the other person left went wrong

[19:18:28] <zerocool> why is iproute2 so unintuitive
[19:18:56] <greycat> I consider it one of the greatest missed opportunities to create a clean, simple and scriptable syntax
[19:20:10] <zerocool> i mean it seems like it should be clean and simple but then it's giving me cryptic errors like 'Error: either "to" is duplicate, or "<ip address>" is a garbage.'
[19:20:30] <zerocool> you can't add/del routes using the same syntax appearently
[19:20:52] <DHE> you should be able to do "ip route del <paste>"
[19:21:11] <zerocool> paste is probably going to be a garbage
[19:21:17] <greycat> Someone decided "Hey, we need to throw away ifconfig and build a whole new tool" and then they didn't design a good interface for their new tool.  Instead, they just threw in random crap everywhere.  It's horrible.

[21:33:27] <punkgeek> before I've decrypt a directory in the ubuntu that people can have physical access, what cases should I checked before decrypting the data? because it needs to be in mounted position until restart. For example, I should check  the root password not to be changed, there is not another account has been added, there is no running bad script or a script won't be run after a while to change the password.

[21:57:06] <punkgeek> No, Let me explain in another way. I have a debian VM, I'am suspect the sysadmin to stoling my encrypted data. So when ever I login to my system and want to decryp my encrypted partition, What cases should I check before mounting? For example, the sysadmin may go to in the rescue mode and add another user with sudo access, So when I mount my encrypted partition, he can access to my data.

[22:20:39] <Hash> If the system admin has access to all your data, then it means, none of it is personal and yours.

[22:21:34] <Hash> Your personal machine, sure, that's legally all your stuff
[22:22:01] <Hash> But if it's a work PC, I'm not sure if anything can be on there that your company shouldn't have access to.
[22:22:23] <Hash> In other words, your company owns the pc and anything you put on it,and so the sysadmin can do whatever he wants.
[22:22:27] <Hash> Check policy.
[22:24:44] <amacater> punkgeek: If you are hiring a VM from a hosting company - your data is yours, but you can never be entirely sure that your VM isn't affected by factors beyond your control. To suspect a sysadmin, you probably need to ask yourself "why am I _so_ special that someone would want to do this to me" ?
