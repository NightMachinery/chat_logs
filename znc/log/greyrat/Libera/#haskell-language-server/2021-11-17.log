[00:10:20] <jneira[m]> <fendor[m]> "jneira: Do I understand it..." <- hmm i would expect it should be done in normalization
[00:10:55] <fendor[m]> hm, don't quite understand this test failure then
[00:11:01] <fendor[m]> will have to debug it tomorrow
[00:11:04] <jneira[m]> but maybe that is the case, it is so i would apply that single change
[00:11:53] <jneira[m]> fendor[m]: so probably your guess is correct ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
[00:14:14] <jneira[m]> pepeiborra: the slides are epic, can i link them in the changelog for 1.5.0?
[00:14:36] <jneira[m]> https://drive.google.com/file/d/16FpmiHXX_rd2gAf5XVgWAIr4kg-AkUqX/view
[00:16:40] <pepeiborra> Thanks, and sure, do link them
[00:21:35] <fendor[m]> <jneira[m]> "hmm i would expect it should..." <- according to the docs, you *should* be right

[16:53:32] <jneira[m]> pepeiborra:  what do you think about could optionally disable `NeedsCompilation` in ghcide upstream, using a cli arg or lsp config option?
[16:53:50] <jneira[m]> s/could//
[16:54:45] <jneira[m]> adavnced users with other projects not using th could use it as well and sigma would have one minus patch
[16:56:04] <jneira[m]> hmm the rule checks for th existence in the whole project
[16:56:45] <jneira[m]> i wonder if that check could be done faster ü§î
[17:11:19] <jneira[m]> maybe detecting if the project has globally enabled `NoTemplateHaskell` or something alike
[17:11:35] <jneira[m]> so the flag and the ide would be aligned

[21:54:42] <pepeiborra> jneira[m]: that's probably unnecessary - the perf impact in small codebases is negligible. For large enterprise codebases, I would expect most of them use TH anyway
[21:54:42] <pepeiborra> The option can be disabled via API (Development.IDE.Core.Rules.mainRule) so a patch is not needed
[21:54:42] <pepeiborra> I don't think that there is any shortcut here - the rule does the right thing

[22:10:50] <perryprog> o/ this is presumably an HLS issue, but in emacs I'm getting the error "[cradle] ghcide compiled by GHC 8.10 failed to load packages: <command line>: cannot satisfy -package pe-0.1.0.0" in my Main.hs whenever I use a "new" function from Lib.hs, despite everything compiling and running correctly.

[22:12:08] <perryprog> This is haskell-mode and LSP, to be specific
[23:21:23] <fendor[m]> <perryprog> "o/ this is presumably an HLS..." <- new? You mean after a `stack new`?
[23:21:57] <perryprog> Ah, sorry‚ÄîI should've clarified. I mean whenever I add a function in Lib.hs, export it, and then use it in Main.hs.
[23:22:14] <perryprog> I can write up some steps to reproduce if this sounds like an unknown bug.

[23:55:27] <fendor[m]> it sounds very familiar, a stack bug
