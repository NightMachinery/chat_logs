[00:24:59] <lantech19446> the guy who built the site went to school for it and I'm finding stuff that I'm just like why the hell did you do it that way how is this even working. The guy who took over the site I understand not doing it very well and being very basic he had no training in html or css but now that he's gone i'm rebuilding the whole site

[22:44:11] <lantech19446> is there a way to program say my navbar and header into another html document and link to it similar to what I do when I link to css so instead of typing the code 5 times or changing 5 sets of code I change it once and it just works

[23:12:32] <bin> that's usually why content management systems or templating systems are popular if you're going to have a site that's more than just a landing page. you can do it with javascript and also server-side includes i believe, but i dont think there's an html-only way to do it. someone please correct me if this is wrong
[23:19:35] <lantech19446> hmm ok that sucks but it is what it is i guess
[23:27:41] <bin> i guess you could iframe it but that seems like a bad idea and probably bad practice
[23:48:31] <lantech19446> I think there's a way to do it with php, I'll have to examine my bosses code to see how he did it
