[00:06:21] <biys> causative: "as soon as someone tries to describe a heaven or utopia in vivid concrete terms, we tend to be put off or repelled"
[00:06:41] <biys> this article is completely and entirely about someones interpretation of another persons description of a supposed utopia
[00:06:55] <biys> and how the two do not align because each person is simply a victim of their intersectionanlity
[00:07:12] <biys> if you were to ask an impoverished person their perspective on utopia it is highly unlikely it would be the same as someone who was well-off
[00:07:31] <biys> the article keeps making reference to the "description!!!" of utopia
[00:07:53] <biys> and how once you actually get into the bread and butter of the conversation...  the utopia will likely not align across all groups
[00:08:41] <biys> it's really a two part commentary on two things.  once we've written in stone what our idea of a utopia is... and we're living out that utopia, it will likely change
[00:09:06] <biys> secondly, the perceptions of others based on our, individual, descriptions of utopia
[00:09:56] <biys> not "ones idea" of utopia
[00:10:10] <biys> this is breaking down, in essense, as a result of the idea that people do not share the same mind
[00:10:52] <biys> there is a short mention of the idea that regardless of the utopia, people still have a desire to be near the top of a heirarchy
[00:11:46] <biys> would i be incline to a utopia where someone is simply GIVEN something that i had to work significantly hard for?
[00:12:43] <biys> there is a difference between the idea of utopia in our head, the utopia we DESCRIBE and the utopia as interpreted by others
[00:12:58] <biys> based on our individual descriptions
[00:15:04] <biys> the hypocrisy is as a result of the idea that it's essentially ebing called a utopia
[00:15:09] <biys> a utopia for who?
[00:17:32] <biys> "But this isn’t what we want to think, or to say to others. With our words, and with other very visible cheap actions, we want to be pro-social. That is, we want to say that we want to help society overall. Or at least to help our society. While we really crave fights by which we might rise relative to others, we want to frame those fights in our minds and words as fighting for society overall, such as
[00:17:39] <biys>  by fighting for justice against the bad guys."
[00:20:27] <biys> furthermore, i don't think utopia in it's origin is necessarily a betterment for "society".   it's a betterment for _A_ society
[00:20:55] <biys> which is why i think it was originally a fictional island

[01:28:09] <causative> the context is pro-truth
[01:28:13] <causative> anti-falsehood
[01:28:52] <biys> whatever that means
[01:29:27] <causative> whatever the truth may be, I'm in favor of it being discovered, even if it's not what I currently believe - and so should all
[01:29:46] <causative> the truth-finding process must not be subordinated to any particular agenda, political or otherwise
[01:30:22] <trbp> so practically there is not truth finding
[01:30:24] <causative> the process of finding truth, uncovering lies, sits above any particular views we may hold at a particular time
[01:31:06] <trbp> because it cannot be subordinated to anything else it cannot subordinate to some simple rules
[01:31:19] <causative> any views held at any particular time may be wrong, and we should recognize this, because it is another truth
[01:31:44] <biys> care to provide me with a current truth?
[01:31:48] <causative> and because considering the possibility of error is the way in which we abandon false beliefs in favor of true ones
[01:32:28] <biys> void of presupposed axioms
[01:32:28] <causative> sure biys , for example, there's a knife on my desk
[01:32:29] <trbp> who defines what is true and what is wrong?
[01:32:33] <causative> that's a truth
[01:32:40] <biys> i don't know if it's truth
[01:32:44] <I_Am_M00t> what if you use it as a fork?
[01:32:46] <I_Am_M00t> is it still a knife?
[01:32:48] <causative> that has no effect on whether it is a truth biys
[01:32:50] <biys> you're telling me it is though
[01:32:50] <trbp> causative: is that a truth or is that your truth?
[01:33:08] <I_Am_M00t> is a knife that isn't used a knife? or just decoration? :O
[01:33:20] <causative> yes of course
[01:33:25] <causative> anyway this knife is often used
[01:33:48] <trbp> so we must complie to your truth
[01:33:59] <causative> trbp, the truth is not owned by anybody
[01:34:00] <I_Am_M00t> yes trbp, you must comply to causative
[01:34:12] <causative> truth is not the same as what any particular person claims
[01:34:27] <biys> i am not observing the phenom myself.  i am obbserving your perception of the phenom
[01:34:34] <biys> firstly i need to assume your perception is accurate
[01:34:35] <causative> what a person says is the "map" - the truth is the "territory" of which it is a map
[01:34:43] <I_Am_M00t> nobody knows the territory
[01:34:46] <I_Am_M00t> so it's a moot point
[01:35:12] <biys> i wish i could talk in absolutes about anything
[01:35:12] <causative> it's not in any way a moot point, because if the map is wrong, you might fall off a cliff
[01:35:16] <biys> how liberating that must be
[01:35:29] <arrogantula> phenomenon*
[01:35:31] <causative> the territory is there, unchanged, regardless of what we write on the map
[01:35:35] <I_Am_M00t> the map is not the territory, it's a moot point
[01:36:05] <causative> you can write on your map that there's a gentle slope, great for skiing, but if you ski down it and the actual territory has a cliff, you're going to die
[01:36:16] <trbp> why use a map anyways?
[01:36:27] <causative> to help decide where to go
[01:36:28] <trbp> the projection of 3d into 2d
[01:36:38] <trbp> is there not information lost?
[01:36:50] <causative> yes, there's a great deal of information lost
[01:36:53] <I_Am_M00t> lol, when did we go from "the map is not the territory" to "the map is truth"?
[01:37:05] <I_Am_M00t> the fact that the map is not the territory weakens the ideal of truth
[01:37:11] <causative> <causative> what a person says is the "map" - the truth is the "territory" of which it is a map
[01:37:13] <I_Am_M00t> you don't know the truth, is the point
[01:37:22] <causative> you've got it backwards I_Am_M00t
[01:37:25] <I_Am_M00t> no no
[01:37:28] <causative> it's not "the map is truth"
[01:37:30] <causative> the territory is truth
[01:37:34] <causative> the map is what we say about the territory
[01:37:35] <I_Am_M00t> i see what this is, it's you declaring how things are
[01:37:47] <causative> the map may be wrong
[01:37:55] <I_Am_M00t> you're pointing out the flaw in every statement, yet carrying on as if nothing happened
[01:38:43] <causative> just because the map may be wrong does not mean we stop using it, nor does it invalidate the concept of maps
[01:39:03] <biys> if the map is wrong we don't stop using it
[01:39:20] <biys> well.  i'd stop using it.  and i'd stop getting maps frmo who-ever provided it
[01:39:22] <I_Am_M00t> what are you talking about?
[01:39:23] <causative> we do once we know it's wrong, or we correct the map once we know it's wrong
[01:39:30] <causative> but I didn't say the map was wrong
[01:39:33] <causative> I said the map *may* be wrong
[01:39:36] <causative> which is different
[01:39:41] <trbp> I_Am_M00t: to be fair, to stand correct to yourself you cannot even tell the truth about your observation of his declaration from your moot point
[01:39:47] <trbp> scnr ;)
[01:40:00] <I_Am_M00t> my observation is accurate, in that he's evading the issue
[01:40:06] <causative> the map may also be right
[01:40:14] <biys> you're saying we don't know it's not correct so therefore we operate under the premise it's correct?
[01:40:27] <causative> yes, that's true biys
[01:40:34] <I_Am_M00t> when did we move past the question of doubting the map, to whether maps are useful?
[01:40:35] <causative> we think the map is right, so we navigate using it
[01:40:41] <biys> i didn't need to jump into a fire to know i would get burned
[01:40:43] <trbp> I_Am_M00t: lets agree he is adjusting his maps :)
[01:40:48] <I_Am_M00t> it's goalpost movement
[01:41:12] <causative> no it's not
[01:41:20] <I_Am_M00t> lol
[01:41:27] <trbp> biys: would you know that, if you did not before hand got burned?
[01:41:28] <I_Am_M00t> ok, it's not. I will obey your command
[01:42:14] <causative> we always acknowledge that whatever we think may be wrong - but we still think it, and act based on it as if it was true
[01:42:16] <biys> trbp: i watched how fire operated, i seen what the fire did.  i don't need to experience being squished by a wheel roller to know i will get squished by a wheel roller
[01:42:45] <causative> "I may be wrong about X" does not stop me and should not stop me from asserting X
[01:42:56] <I_Am_M00t> causative: i don't know what you're talking about, what you're addressing
[01:43:01] <trbp> biys: would you still know if you never ever got squished by anything
[01:43:10] <causative> truth, I_Am_M00t
[01:43:18] <causative> and how we interact with it
[01:43:20] <I_Am_M00t> > causative: i don't know what you're talking about, what you're addressing
[01:43:29] <biys> could my knowledge be obtained by being the squisher and not the squishee ?
[01:43:36] <trbp> biys: or be at least good enough in assuming what squishing is, told or observed from others?
[01:44:09] <biys> this conversation is fun
[01:44:14] <causative> I_Am_M00t, I think - or at least I hope - that most people already have an idea of what truth is
[01:44:19] <causative> that it's different from just what people say

[01:44:36] <I_Am_M00t> ok? well, ok
[01:44:47] <causative> did you never form this concept, or did you use to have this concept and later decided to abandon it for philosophical reasons?
[01:45:03] <I_Am_M00t> what? lol
[01:45:20] <I_Am_M00t> this is a wild convo
[01:45:34] <trbp> biys: in both cases direct contact, we went one further and assumed we are good enough to be able to more abstract occasions
[01:45:52] <biys> ooooh
[01:45:57] <biys> okay okay
[01:46:24] <biys> so the formulation of the idea in my mind about squishing or being squished, void of any kind of experience
[01:46:53] <causative> the truth is different from what you say, and it's different from what I say
[01:47:00] <audrey> Are we still having this conversation
[01:47:02] <causative> often what you say, or what I say, coincides with the truth
[01:47:08] <audrey> :please_clap_face:
[01:47:10] <trbp> yep just because you trust your sum of own observations and those of others you trust
[01:47:37] <causative> but the truth is not the same as what we trust or believe - it's different, outside of us
[01:47:40] <biys> i don't really trust my own observations
[01:47:48] <I_Am_M00t> i don't get this conversation, it feels like questions and subtle ideas are getting mixed up
[01:48:25] <I_Am_M00t> causative: you seem to be pushing the idea about a separation between beliefs and some external truth... but why is that the critical question ? lol
[01:48:30] <biys> my perceptions of my obsevations could be inaccurate (and usually are frmo my experiences)
[01:48:31] <I_Am_M00t> i don't think most people deny this concept
[01:48:43] <I_Am_M00t> the question is, why is your belief correct?
[01:48:57] <I_Am_M00t> why should I follow your belief?
[01:49:02] <causative> you were saying the truth is a moot point
[01:49:08] <causative> it's not a moot point
[01:49:12] <I_Am_M00t> what? :S lol
[01:49:25] <causative> <I_Am_M00t> nobody knows the territory
[01:49:25] <causative> <I_Am_M00t> so it's a moot point
[01:49:26] <I_Am_M00t> ok, it's not a moot point.
[01:49:36] <causative> and it's not the same as what people say
[01:49:38] <trbp> nobody said a sum must be >0
[01:49:39] <causative> what people say is the map
[01:49:45] <causative> the truth is the territory, outside the map
[01:49:45] <I_Am_M00t> do you always get super literal to prove points? lol
[01:50:04] <I_Am_M00t> the issue here is that you can't merely assert that you align with truth, you have to prove it
[01:50:19] <I_Am_M00t> nobody cares that you understand the distinction between a belief and "external truth"
[01:50:23] <I_Am_M00t> that's why it's moot
[01:50:24] <trbp> is it possible to prove something without the concept of truth?
[01:50:31] <I_Am_M00t> not because there actually is no point in seeking truth
[01:50:51] <causative> I haven't advocated, in this conversation, any specific method for finding truth, I've only spoken in favor of doing so
[01:51:03] <I_Am_M00t> lol, ok
[01:51:10] <causative> but there's been talk by you and trbp as if truth were just what people say
[01:51:25] <I_Am_M00t> what the helll... *facepalm*
[01:51:41] <causative> like <trbp> causative: is that a truth or is that your truth?
[01:51:47] <causative> <I_Am_M00t> yes trbp, you must comply to causative
[01:51:50] <I_Am_M00t> do you take everything literally causative ?
[01:51:55] <I_Am_M00t> lol
[01:51:57] <causative> it's not "my truth"
[01:51:58] <dude12312414> yes... the concept of proof doesn't really require the concept of truth. You can view a proof as a kind of puzzle, starting from axioms, applying some rules, and reaching a desired claim
[01:52:00] <causative> there's *the truth*
[01:52:10] <causative> and just because I am saying something is true, does not make it "my truth"

[01:52:19] <I_Am_M00t> causative: by declaring that it's not "your truth" you are asserting that you hold the knowledge of external truth
[01:52:28] <causative> indeed I am

[01:52:37] <I_Am_M00t> lol :D
[01:52:49] <I_Am_M00t> he even admits it
[01:52:53] <causative> in the example given, I am asserting that I hold the knowledge that there's a knife on my desk

[01:53:04] <causative> asserting you know an external truth

[01:53:20] <biys> they aren't
[01:53:36] <biys> i like causative, personally
[01:53:42] <causative> now when I assert that I know an external truth, it is always understood that there is the possibility that I'm wrong
[01:53:43] <biys> i'd subscribe to their blog and read their work
[01:53:56] <causative> I'm asserting X, while acknowledging I'm not certain of X and X may be false
[01:54:08] <biys> i'm never wrong in the assertion that i am probably wrong
[01:54:16] <causative> and if X does happen to be true, it's not "my truth," it's *the* truth'
[01:54:23] <causative> the truth that I happen to know and assert
[01:54:43] <causative> and if X happens to be false, it's still not "my truth" or "my falsehood," it's *the falsehood*.  The falsehood that I happen to be falsely asserting.
[01:55:02] <causative> there's what I say - which is uncertain - and then there's what is true - which may coincide with what I say, or may not
[01:55:11] <trbp> causative: who defines what is true or false?
[01:55:20] <trbp> who sets your axioms for that?
[01:55:22] <biys> ugh. this companies security policy consists of the idea that the more often i have to sign into their service, the more secure they are
[01:55:36] <biys> so low time-outs and 2 factor authentication every 15 minutes is "secure"
[01:55:36] <causative> you're just making the same mistake I spent some time refuting trbp
[01:55:48] <causative> whether there's a knife on my desk has nothing to do with what anyone thinks or defines
[01:55:49] <causative> it's just there
[01:56:00] <causative> (or, with very low probability, it's not there)
[01:56:03] <trbp> biys: i like such concepts, it is much better if they randomly force you to reset your password :)
[01:56:15] <biys> haha
[01:57:01] <trbp> causative: before i can admit to an inherent truth or false
[01:57:20] <trbp> may i have the right to ask on which rule i have to differ them both?
[01:57:44] <trbp> or is it ok for you that what you say true is my false and vice versa and both are ture and false at the same time?
[01:58:19] <causative> you don't have "my false" and if we disagree it does not mean "both are true and false at the same time"
[01:58:37] <causative> there's only one truth - if we disagree, at least one of us is wrong
[01:58:56] <trbp> why?
[01:59:03] <causative> truth is not what's in your head - what's in your head is the map.  truth is the territory
[01:59:14] <trbp> where is the rule that makes one of us true the other wrong?
[01:59:26] <causative> well, in this case, it would be the physical fact of there being a knife on my desk
[01:59:48] <causative> that physical fact - independent of both of us - is what makes "there's a knife on my desk" a true statement
[02:00:05] <biys> i would say your knife scenario isn't the end all/be all
[02:00:08] <trbp> see before you have truth you have physical facts
[02:00:15] <biys> i would say it is likely both of you could be false

[02:05:53] <trbp> krb: problem of todays truth and false is it is soo complicated and farfetched that only a handful specialist see if any glimpse
[02:05:54] <krb> one news is that china supposedly have made a giant breakthrough in making a quantum computer. it's been going on for over a year. but what wouldn't make it chinese propaganda
[02:06:22] <krb> and these news continues over and over in various quantum mechanics group on facebook for example
[02:07:40] <trbp> yep, until it gets commonly declared by what circumstanza ever as true or false because more and more understand the complexity and the "outcome" in relation
[02:08:16] <trbp> until then it is a newsworthy true or false article
[02:09:18] <krb> it seems wishful thoughts/delusions is much more powerful than truth
[02:09:54] <trbp> by the in my eyes one of the reason why we are getting more and more clever but no ever so big "scientist" like the old ones are declared, things got sooo complicated that not a single person can cope with the complexity

[02:13:18] <trbp> of course only those that were brave enough to jump the profit barrier
[02:15:15] <krb> there is this store called wish where i ordered a wind generator, it said 4kW 24V in the article, and i barely get 9V in a fullblown storm of 25m/s. this store manage to blow up articles to look too good to be true. but atleast it's honest with its name "wish"
[02:15:41] <krb> honest deception
[02:16:25] <causative> wish is notorious for poor quality products
[02:16:49] <causative> and low prices

[16:24:29] <evolv> covid got me to see the number of deaths caused by the flu each year to those of high risk, like the elderly
[16:24:35] <brigand> they only offer flu shots to over 60 year olds here
[16:24:51] <evolv> where is "here?"
[16:25:21] <brigand> germany
[16:26:23] <brigand> well, they "suggest" flu shots to 60+ but i read it as "hey, don't take the doses from the 60+"
[16:27:33] <evolv> yeah, US the flu shots are suggested to everyone
[16:27:45] <evolv> more strongly recommended for elderly
[16:28:20] <evolv> but given efficacy of flu shots range considerably year-to-year, it's always better to have more people vaccinated

[16:44:55] <evolv> she also had Moderna and I, Pfizer
[16:45:29] <evolv> Moderna is rougher, I've heard
[16:45:43] <evolv> my wife and I both got our boosters and flu shots the same day
[16:46:03] <arryana> luck of the draw, i got moderna for all three

[16:46:53] <evolv> where is "here"
[16:47:40] <arryana> the first two i got in the states, and it was 50% chance of drawing j&j, 25% chance of drawing pfizer, and 25% chance of moderna.  it depended which entry you went in, and you didn't know when you pulled up which it would be.
[16:47:52] <arryana> now i'm in the uk, and what they're giving out as boosters is moderna
[16:47:54] <evolv> I haven't caught up at all with the studies, so I have no idea if they've done an analysis on those who've managed to get a plurality of shots with different brans

[16:49:07] <evolv> that's right, I vaguely recall people who got J&J getting another company's shot

[16:49:43] <evolv> of my three shots, only the second was uncomfortable

[16:50:19] <blkshp> :O
[16:50:23] <arryana> yesterday was just muscle pain, a couple hours of fever, and a headache
[16:50:46] <evolv> I was kind of tired, but the next day I woke up with neck and back pain, which probably can be attributed to the immune response and the way I slept
[16:50:49] <arryana> i'm old, that probably has something to do with it too
[16:50:50] <blkshp> I had booked it for the 3rd of Jan about 15 miles away but I got a text from my GP saying.. "COme, come get stabbed now! :D)
[16:51:02] <arryana> evidently there's a difference in side effects by age

[16:52:01] <arryana> 50s
[16:52:19] <evolv> 50s seems like the a weird decade
[16:52:22] <arryana> haha
[16:52:53] <evolv> something about the 50s where everything you've done to yourself throughout your life shows
[16:53:02] * arryana shrugs
[16:53:12] <arryana> maybe for some
[16:53:13] <evolv> so you have people in their 50s who stay physically and mentally in their late 30s/early 40s
[16:53:22] <evolv> and those who look mid to late 60s
[16:53:28] * arryana giggles
[16:53:37] <arryana> i like getting older, at least so far
[16:53:38] <evolv> even then, I find 60s young
[16:53:43] <evolv> "young"
[16:54:23] <arryana> i'm hoping to still be raising hell then
[16:54:40] <evolv> and I know why. It's not just because I'm mid/late 30s and see those decades coming, but my grandparents' generation vs my parents'
[16:56:40] <evolv> mentally, I've stopping perceiving the aging process at around 28
[16:57:23] <evolv> I was warned something like that will happen, and eventually I'll see an old man in the mirror one day
[16:57:45] <arryana> oh, that didn't happen to me
[16:57:55] <arryana> but i've enjoyed the process immensely

[17:01:04] <evolv> I have to remind him that the energy he lost may have had something to do with getting married and having two kids
[17:01:26] <arryana> if i had to nail it down to one thing, and i think in reality there's more to it, age seems to hit people harder if they are not where they want to be in life.
[17:01:49] <arryana> yeah, not having kids of my own absolutely made it easier.

[19:06:31] <biys> i am... blackpilled
[19:06:32] <biys> HAH
[19:07:11] <pussipupu> "left" and "right" are such contested terms they're basically unusable without specification
[19:07:26] <biys> i don't really agree with that
[19:07:32] <biys> but i could see how someone would think that
[19:07:45] <biys> i tend to use right and left to describe progressives vs. non-progressives now days
[19:07:55] <biys> but a lot of the conservatives are okay with non-traditional aspects now days
[19:07:58] <biys> which seems strange to me
[19:08:46] <biys> a lot of my "trad chritians, conservative" friends are okay with homosexuality, even though they consider it a sin
[19:09:07] <biys> and i'm like: "i think god says that you can't be luke warm in these situations or he'll spew you out of his mouth"
[19:09:27] <biys> but i find most christians now days aren't really christians other than by self prclaimed labels
[19:10:13] <biys> but i really don't know how to reconcile the idea that jesus says to love everyone while homosexuality is a sin
[19:10:29] <pussipupu> arryana, I don't know if you've been there long enough to see, but for instance the BBC has moved their "moderate" spectrum from basically Blair-Thatcher to the economic right and authoritarian and tightened it so it's basically covering the ruling sector of the Tory regime
[19:10:49] <pussipupu> Interesting but also pretty depressing
[19:12:02] <biys> it is in the churches best interest to not alienate itself though
[19:12:11] <biys> tithes!

[19:12:55] <audrey> biys: blackpilled is smartpilled

[19:13:47] <brigand> https://i.imgur.com/OeVgXvc.jpg
[19:14:10] <audrey> I don't like applying those kinds of political labels to myself, either.
[19:14:15] * arryana finishes the main part of a blanket and starts on the edging
[19:14:34] <audrey> I used to call myself a leftist until I realized that the meaning of the word changed radically over the last 50 years to mean something I am not
[19:14:47] <pussipupu> I rather think the next regime here might be much more authoritarian/xenophobic/austerityish than the current lot, which is a shame
[19:14:49] <biys> i remember when i was younger i went to this church that was right beside two old folks homes.  i remember one day i rolled up with my 20" bmx.  i did some kind of trick and one of the deacons came and grabbed me by the scruff of the collar "do you think we want people doing stuff like this around OUR CHURCH?!"
[19:14:58] <biys> i said "yes, i would like to see more people on bikes around here"
[19:15:06] <audrey> there really isn't a good term for someone who is economically "left wing" and socially "right wing". I posed the question to my friend and she jokingly suggested "Populism"
[19:15:41] <biys> ^
[19:15:42] <biys> truth
[19:15:52] <pussipupu> What do you mean by “socially right wing”? “authoritarian”?
[19:16:01] <biys> i am amazed, in canada anyways, how many of the progressives don't undertand that truduea is a populist
[19:16:15] <biys> trudeau
[19:16:58] <audrey> Is Trudeau socially right-wing, though?
[19:17:18] <biys> he's very much so just a mouth piece for the UN
[19:17:20] <biys> so no
[19:17:46] <audrey> He seems to be highly invested in social justice-style policies, etc. which is not what I would call "socially right"
[19:18:11] <biys> canadian curriculum is original position/veil of ignorance
[19:18:19] <biys> it's pretty much embedded in the curriculum
[19:18:33] <biys> rawls theory of justice
[19:18:38] <audrey> IDK, maybe social right-wing isn't the best term. I'm just trying to distinguish between, say, the left wing in the United States, and the left wing in a place like Russia.
[19:18:40] *** Joins: Brainium (~brainium@user/brainium)
[19:19:07] <arryana> i tend not to trust anyone who defines themselves by their political beliefs first
[19:19:08] <audrey> While the two might agree one some economic issues, there's a major gulf in terms of social attitudes.
[19:19:10] <biys> i think that socially right is more-so, typically, associated with being pragmantic
[19:19:14] <biys> if you watch any YAF
[19:19:28] <biys> when they talk about social tendencies, they tend to talk about traditional values
[19:19:33] <biys> such as the nuclear family
[19:19:52] <audrey> While I"m not really a leftist in either sense, I have to say I relate more to the Russian-style, culturally conservative model than the US model
[19:20:03] <audrey> This might just be a factor of my upbringing.
[19:20:15] <biys> yes
[19:20:19] <biys> i agree with that
[19:20:25] <audrey> But I've always believed in emphasizing class before race or any other identity trait, whereas in the US/West, the rubric has been turned on its head
[19:20:28] <biys> ones intersectionality helps formualt their persepctive on the matter
[19:20:52] <audrey> and you will now see people from DSA, etc., de-emphasizing class conflict and emphasizing intersectionality
[19:21:03] <audrey> which is not something that I associate with classical leftist principles
[19:21:45] <biys> i think that intersectioanlity has actually become a veil for talking about critical race theory
[19:21:48] <biys> now days
[19:22:09] <audrey> And why I am completely baffled when people talk about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez et al. being "socialists" or "leftists" - simply because that's not what I've ever understood by the term.

[19:24:50] <biys> audrey: have youw atched the david frum / steve bannon munk debate yet?
[19:25:12] <audrey> It's a peculiarity of American political discourse that "culturally conservative" and "economically left-wing" are seen as incompatible.
[19:25:42] <audrey> There is no reason a priori why the two can't mix, and I would argue that historically, most left-wing political movements actually  have been culturally conservative.
[19:25:50] <biys> fiscally conservative progressive?
[19:26:44] <audrey> The Soviet revolution in 1917 started out with some very radical attempts to dismantle the family structure, endorse free love, etc., and it quickly morphed into something highly resembling 1950s America
[19:26:50] <biys> fiscal conservative, social pliberal
[19:27:16] <audrey> because the common masses - whom the revolution were ostensibly for - actually did not share any of those radical cultural beliefs
[19:27:25] <audrey> s/were/was
[19:27:25] <ro-bot-o> audrey meant to say: because the common masses - whom the revolution was ostensibly for - actually did not share any of those radical cultural beliefs
[19:28:15] <audrey> You saw something similar happen in China, and by the time you get around to Cuba, Vietnam etc. the model was pretty much set in stone.
[19:29:00] <audrey> Gay rights took a long time to come around to ex-communist countries and in some cases never arrived (I'm looking at you, Putin)
[19:29:51] <kmh> audrey,  or vanishing again
[19:30:02] <kmh> audrey,  see china, poland, hungary
[19:31:10] <audrey> Obviously I don't mean I endorse this when I allude to "socially conservative". I'm simply trying to contrast this to e.g. Western kinds of leftism because I think it belies an important distinction that's often overlooked
[19:32:08] <audrey> Contrariwise, whenever I hear GOP/National Review types whine about how so-and-so Democratic politician is a secret commie, I have to laugh - as far as "family values" are concerned, William Buckley and the mainstream Soviet public would have had a lot in common.

[19:35:34] <audrey> Poland is a little more conservative than Russia, socially
[19:36:12] <mannequin> poland is a mess
[19:36:21] <audrey> Gay rights poll equally poorly in both countries. It's always been confusing to me why Poland is a EU member when it manifestly does not share the same values as e.g. France.
[19:37:09] <audrey> biys: "Fiscally conservative progressive" (the inverse of what I am talking about) goes by "libertarianism" in the US

[19:49:58] <I_Am_M00t> fiscally shortsighted
[19:51:30] <biys> I_Am_M00t: i do tend to agree with that
[19:51:44] <biys> like the conversation causative and i were having earlier (conversation past each other)
[19:51:54] <biys> it's the poor bashing book i read by jean swanson
[19:52:20] <biys> the programs that are made to assist people who have been marginalized to some extent extent or another
[19:52:34] <biys> are not the people who are given a voice when it comes to the creation of the programs
[19:52:46] <biys> so it's sugegsted that the programs tend to be insufficient as a result
[19:53:08] <biys> cause in reality... how can you not poll the group you're attempting to help and come to any realization about what they need?
[19:55:32] <biys> it becomes a matter of ones perception about those types of individuals being addressed
[19:55:38] <biys> and not the actual situations of the people
[20:03:46] <audrey> In the West the rich like the thought of the poor and the concern for the poor; but they do not like the smell of the poor, and that is why nothing ever gets better
[20:04:23] <biys> idk if they like the concern for the poor.  the ideas are typically that the poor are just problematic people
[20:04:31] <biys> they've not made good decisions
[20:04:35] <biys> they continue to not make good decisions
[20:04:46] <biys> that social services are avaiable, yet they don't utilize them properly
[20:04:54] <biys> that income mobility exists
[20:04:59] <biys> meritocracy exists
[20:06:38] <audrey> I mean, it's very difficult for someone who's not poor, to get into the mindset of someone who is poor
[20:08:19] <audrey> To me, the only "privilege" talk that makes much sense is one of class privilege
[20:08:39] <audrey> and there is a certain "privilege" in not having to worry about how you're going to eat until your next paycheck
[20:08:51] <audrey> When you have that level of worry, your entire outlook and decision-making process change
[20:10:13] <audrey> It's easy to talk about "planning ahead", etc., when you don't have this worry
[20:11:18] <audrey> I have an interesting level of insight into this, as my family went from "dirt poor" to "stereotypically middle class" over the course of about 80 years
[20:11:35] <biys> what do y ou think about JBP's claim that the current beliefs surrounding the rich and poor is that the rich are getting rich off the poor of the backs?  that as a direct result of the rich getting rich the poor get poor
[20:11:45] <audrey> my grandfather almost died during the Stalinist famines in '37
[20:12:34] <audrey> today I enjoy a Western standard of living complete with cell phone plan, paid vacations, and retirement fund
[20:13:25] <audrey> That's a pretty crazy reversal of fortunes.

[20:21:41] <audrey> the guy is more insufferable than Zhirinovsky (a well-known and generally despised Russian political demagogue)
[20:22:06] <biys> oh,  the only reason i ask if you watched it is cause bannon lays out exactly the plan they used
[20:22:10] <biys> to get the votes they did
[20:22:20] <audrey> Maybe you could summarise it? If that's not difficult
[20:22:23] <audrey> Or I could read a transcript
[20:22:24] <biys> and it's all based on what he views as being the sentiments of white working class blue collar folk
[20:22:36] <biys> trump wasn't the best option, trump was a "fuck you" to the progressive left
[20:22:47] <audrey> Oh, that. Yes, I can understand that sentiment

[20:35:26] <audrey> So to return to the earlier question, I guess what I mean by "culturally conservative leftism" is "working class values and pro-working class economics"
[20:35:54] <audrey> Working-class values are now represented by the GOP, which is a bizarre development historically, but in the current context makes perfect sense.
[20:36:20] <audrey> The stupid thing here is that GOP economic policies are (in my biased opinion) not going to result in any improvement in quality of life for the working class
[20:36:38] <audrey> So, you are left with two parties, each of which goes against the working class in its own way.
[20:37:09] <audrey> Seen in this context, the election of a demagogue like Trump makes sense, in a way.

[23:38:38] <biys> what civil rights problems do you see currently?
[23:38:38] <audrey> Inflation, the systematic dismantling of the middle class, decreased faith in institutions
[23:38:45] <biys> aaaah
[23:38:46] <biys> okay
[23:39:04] <biys> decreased faith in institutions is why we have flat earth and anti vax
[23:39:05] <biys> imo
[23:39:23] <audrey> The chilling effect of recent trends in academia on free speech (and no, this is not just a Ben Shapiro talking point - I envision this having serious long-term implications for American civil society)
[23:40:01] <audrey> (Largely due to the propagation effects of media)
[23:40:17] <audrey> I mean, «faith in institutions» is a significant barometer for the health of a nation-state.
[23:40:32] <audrey> The USSR collapsed in large part due to a complete loss of faith in the state.
[23:40:50] <audrey> s/media/technology
[23:40:50] <ro-bot-o> audrey meant to say: (Largely due to the propagation effects of technology)

[23:41:31] <audrey> Cuomo getting busted for groping a woman? Terrible as that is, it doesn´t capture the rot that is at the heart of the West
[23:42:39] <biys> where i'd like to take that conversation is uh...  Cuomo and Lemon masquerade as if they operate on a higher moral plain.  so when i think of their collapse i see it as more of a fall from grace.  same thing with JBP talked about cleaning ones room then ended up being a drug addict.  same thing when trudeau platformed on anti-discrimination then got caught in black face
[23:42:56] <biys> if anything, worst case scenario, it did nothing
[23:43:04] <biys> but what i hope it did was show people that moer or less anyone is problematic
[23:44:15] <biys> i would say the divide we're seeing, which is associated with the middle class as you're describing, is this idea that it's related to education
[23:44:27] <biys> that if you're more educated you're less incline to be a "terrible fucking person"

[23:45:16] <biys> but the middle class, as far as i can see, are being told they don't really know much. but it takes me back to fight club
[23:45:19] <biys> the middle class run shit
[23:45:25] <audrey> Technology is largely responsible for this. I´m sure someone has logs of my IRC conversations from 10+ years ago where I said something stupid.
[23:45:27] <biys> "cani get clean soup?"
[23:45:43] <audrey> In the past, well, nobody carried a tape recorder around to every casual conversation; but now everything you say and do online is recorded
[23:45:52] <audrey> And it can be used against you.
[23:45:59] <biys> there is that as well
[23:46:02] <audrey> I say this not in a paranoid way, but a resigned way.
[23:46:19] <biys> where a simple conversation would've just tpyically blown over and been forgotten about
[23:46:24] <biys> we now have it forever and into eternity

[23:47:04] <biys> i actually heard a conversation the othe rday when i was running at the park.  these two guys were talking about, as a result of a person saying ONE stupid thing, how the person is COMPLETELY stupid
[23:47:08] <biys> nothing they say has validity
[23:47:21] <audrey> These days I comport myself online with the assumption that I will be doxed and whatever I say shown to the world.
[23:47:40] <biys> HAH

[23:48:02] <biys> kind of ajoke

[23:48:40] <biys> WOW
[23:48:42] <biys> my bad
[23:48:45] <biys> anyways, it's a meme
[23:49:22] <audrey> I mean, anyone determined enough could probably do it. I´ve given away enough personal info here over the last 13 years.
[23:49:39] <biys> fair enough
[23:49:57] <biys> given it's IRC there's plausible deniability though
[23:50:05] <biys> logs can be fabricated, created
[23:50:36] <audrey> These days I operate on the principle of deliberate ambiguity
[23:50:52] <audrey> there is a full name in my IRC client ident, but I refuse to confirm or deny that that is my real name
[23:51:27] <biys> well.  didn't twitter say they weren't gonna allow peopel to post pictures unless there was consent frmo the personin the picture?
[23:51:30] <biys> i think i read that somewhere
[23:51:51] <biys> https://theconversation.com/twitter-has-banned-posting-of-images-of-people-without-their-consent-heres-why-thats-a-good-thing-173122
[23:51:51] <ro-bot-o> [url] Twitter has banned posting of images of people without their consent – here's why that's a good thing | theconversation.com
[23:51:54] <biys> idk if it's true or not
[23:51:57] <biys> i don't twitter at all
[23:52:12] <audrey> and if you try to google my name you don get any good results - but that could be because I´ve done a very good job of staying off the internet
[23:52:15] <audrey> *don´t
[23:52:24] <biys> i'm a ghost
[23:52:32] <biys> when you google my name you get a different person completely
[23:53:42] <biys> when i started irc back in the early 90's... i started out with a crew called "phonelosers"
[23:54:00] <biys> and one of the things i observed very quickly was "dropping docs"
[23:54:02] <audrey> Legally speaking, there is no reasonable expectation to privacy in public
[23:54:09] <biys> and how that typically never went really well for people
[23:54:16] <biys> phoen harassment, harassing peoples employers, etc
[23:54:24] <biys> and that was back in the early 90's when phone calls were expensive
[23:54:30] <audrey> Reverse the charges
[23:55:12] <biys> and it was back in the early days of social engineering

[23:55:55] <biys> which is right around the same time i got interested in picking locks
[23:56:31] <biys> but anyways.  i think the article you posted yesterday
[23:56:32] <biys> Havel

[23:56:41] <biys> i think that pretty much sums up what we're seeing right now
[23:56:44] <audrey> You are a sly one!
[23:56:51] <biys> it's a lot of virtue signaliing and posturing
[23:56:56] <biys> and it's uh...
[23:57:14] <biys> don't buy coke because you like coke, buy coke because coke donates money to a cause you share interest with
[23:58:01] <audrey> The funny thing is, when I show the Havel essay to most Anglophones it doesn´t even register with them that this might share similarities to the Western landscape.

[23:58:30] <biys> the part i left out was the part where it's simply just done as a form of tradition
[23:58:32] <audrey> We are accustomed to seeing Eastern Europe´s history as something completely isolated from historical analogues.
[23:58:53] <audrey> Well, it becomes a tradition after long enough - tradition in the sense of, «this is the way it´s always been done and we don´t wish to upset the apple cart»
[23:59:18] <biys> this was an interesting thing to me as well
[23:59:23] *** Quits: zegalch (~zegalch@178.128.75.133) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:59:24] <biys> it's like... you also don't wanna alienate yourself
[23:59:33] <biys> if you alienate yourself from your peer group
[23:59:40] <biys> you become an island
[23:59:41] *** Joins: zegalch (~zegalch@178.128.75.133)
[23:59:42] <audrey> I think most traditions are like this. Why get baptised as e.g. a Methodist when neither you nor your parents really believe in God all that sincerely?
[23:59:49] <audrey> Well, because it´s just Something That´s Done.
