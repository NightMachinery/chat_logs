[01:21:33] <DPA> Magic. People wouldn't believe it if you told them it exists. I don't believe in magic. However, like with most things, I can't disprove it's existence. Therefore, it would make sense to try a spell from time to time, just in case.
[01:21:33] <DPA> Now, there are loads of random get more look and better grade spells, and there is absolutely crazy ritual shit, but I kind of fail to find anything reasonable.
[01:21:33] <DPA> Like, something without obvious reason to be wanted by anyone, or something systematic that makes sense. I can't find anything like that...
[01:22:39] <Inline>  i have a ritual of farting
[01:23:45] <Inline> it relaxes my belly, it makes sense, it's systematic and without obvious reason
[01:25:13] <DPA> I don't think that's magic, though.
[01:25:20] <Inline> for me it is
[01:25:24] <Inline> it is magic
[01:25:41] <Inline> maybe you lost one of your wondering capabilities
[01:26:29] <DPA> possible
[01:27:07] <Inline> have you ever seen people in clinic with serious constipation up to the point of blasting ?
[01:27:50] <DPA> No, that sounds unpleasant, even to just witness.
[01:28:26] <Inline> and where doctors and nurses are bathing in shit after they unclogged it

[01:32:05] <Inline> even amongst docs
[01:33:02] <Inline> the same with biology especially with some people like entomologists
[01:33:18] <Inline> have you ever looked at some of those bugs under the binocular ?
[01:33:29] <Inline> they appear like monsters
[01:33:38] <Inline> yet entomologist speak of beauty
[01:33:40] <Inline> lol
[01:39:12] <DPA> So you suggest I better explore reality, look at wonders known to exist, rather than search for what shouldn't exist?
[01:40:14] <Inline> no i didn't say that

[16:49:31] <lalia> Greetings fellow Libera denizen!
[16:50:13] <arryana> yay, what's the good word
[16:51:18] <lalia> Just fed the cat. :P Gonna relax for a bit before the kiddo gets up and then do laundry the rest of the day. :D
[16:51:24] <lalia> How're y'all?
[16:53:42] <arryana> it's a crochet day
[16:54:07] <arryana> i can't say i get it, but i keep getting asked for hagbags
[16:55:20] <lalia> :D
[16:55:44] <lalia> Hopefully a smooth and relaxing series of projects. :)
[16:56:05] <arryana> oh, it's certainly pleasant enough
[16:56:08] <arryana> and not demanding
[16:56:18] <arryana> it only takes me a few hours to make one
[16:56:49] <arryana> at some point i'm just going to have to bow to the inevitablity and put up an etsy shop, or whatever people do with such things to make it official

[17:02:17] <arryana> they trashed leicester square
[17:02:37] <lalia> English footie fans need to tone down the overt racism and rage... it's probably quite overdue.
[17:02:56] <arryana> the whole thing is insane, given the transmission rates right now
[17:03:01] <arryana> there's going to be a huge spike in cases
[17:03:37] <lalia> Some wild shit goes down every time there's a big footie event and yeah, it's almost like everyone deliberately ignores the pandemic conditions.

[22:13:13] <biys> communication is absolutely terrible if you think about it
[22:13:25] <biys> the imagery associated with words and phrased in my mind is likely going to be different than yours
[22:13:43] <biys> so when we atmtept to ``paint this picture'' it can't be done with a 10-20 second connversation
[22:14:17] <biys> i use the same examples for all this i always use...  if i grew up 8 mile detroit and you grew up beverly hills 90210 our ideas of acceptable would be different.  where i'd sag my pants and wear a backwards ball cap you'd be wearing khakis and a polo
[22:14:20] <pussipupu> Communication is wonderful, especially when one thinks about it :p
[22:14:56] <biys> the second example is... if you asked me what ``hell'' is... i would likely say it's about a half a day without the internet.  if you asked my father, he'd likely say abject poverty
[22:15:10] <biys> so when we're using the word in the line of words that we're using to paint this picture
[22:15:19] <biys> we wonder to what extent we're actually understanding eachother
[22:15:29] <biys> truly understanding eachother
[22:19:51] <brigand> biys: if there weren't poor people that would be hell for your father?
[22:23:06] <biys> being in a state of abject poverty would be hell
[22:23:17] <biys> the lowest possible poverty you could be in
