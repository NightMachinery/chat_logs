[16:27:26] <birkoff> maybe some intersting usage of @namespace ?
[16:27:43] <Patsie> I think awk-chip8 is nicely @namespace'd
[16:28:16] <birkoff> i would love to hear even if generally, as to gain more insight into what applicable uses are possible
[16:29:45] <birkoff> or, where would I want to use awk in day to day problems
[16:31:38] <Patsie> well, what's applicable to some might not always be applicable to you
[16:31:56] <Patsie> so I think it's best to just look at things and decide what you want to use yourself or not
[16:32:22] <Patsie> and I think any interesting project is good enough for that (even if they are games)
[16:32:40] <Patsie> you might learn some interesting new techniques from even a project like that
