[16:34:42] <a12l> Hi! When I try to go to a website I press `C-l` and write in the website's url, but I always get redirected to DDG. I see a error message at the bottom saying that `Warning: JavaScript error: invalid number of arguments: 2`, but I have no idea what other arguments a `open url` function would need.
[16:35:37] <waleee> a12l: which nyxt-version?
[16:36:23] <a12l> waleee: 2.0.0
[16:38:40] <waleee> it had some issues with open-url so I would recommend updating to 2.2.4 if possible
[16:40:02] <waleee> * issues with set-url

[18:08:42] <a12l> Nyxt crashes, but I suspect it has to do with my distribution's packaging. Thanks for your time waleee !
[18:35:35] <lagash> a12l: oh hey, you made it! :D

[20:05:31] <mariari> why does CL objects only have eq equality but structs have full blown equalp equality when wanted?
[20:05:36] <mariari> drives me a bit bad
[20:05:38] <mariari> mad*
[20:06:16] <mariari> classes in general are rather verbose in comparison to structs, but the flexibility is nice
[20:12:13] <pjb> mariari: Please read: http://www.nhplace.com/kent/PS/EQUAL.html
[20:13:28] <pjb> mariari: notably, you may have derived slots (computed from other slots), cache slots, lazy slots,  and depending on your application, your objects may be interned or not.
[20:16:10] <mariari> Sure that can be the case, however you could maybe have different derivation strategies for whatever the domain may be

[20:17:20] <mariari> I guess that is just lamenting the standardization of function derivation from various structures, which can likely be setup via mixins in CLOS
