[00:05:41] <mdogg> Actually, I read that the black lady Uhuru (I think) in a major series was ground breaking at the time.  That doesn't excuse anything I guess, but progress usually happens over time.. 
[00:06:14] <blkshp> She was and It was, I didn't mean to diminish it for it's time, but it's so behind where we are now, it's a little cringey.
[00:06:33] <blkshp> And she's still working now, she's a fantastic woman.

[00:54:29] <SteppenwolfVM> this are the lyrics of a song i like musically https://www.musixmatch.com/de/songtext/Bell-Witch/Mirror-Reaper
[00:54:43] <SteppenwolfVM> i feel like i'm missing something in almost every single phrase of it
[00:55:04] <SteppenwolfVM> does it just express being lost and depressive with poetry or is there any deeper meaning to all the phrases?
[00:55:12] <mdogg> It's valid - though the word "world" would not need to be capitalized.   If you are referring to the computer program, then World would be capitalized as a proper noun.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program

[01:01:42] <mdogg> Poetry is an art form which many times will stir different emotions in different individuals.  Sometimes an individual may read a poem and interoperate it differently from one day to the next depending on their mood.  If the poem is also a song, the song itself may lend additional clues as to what the writer/singer wants to get across.

[07:25:12] <jaggz> That "Oh God," part ... I guess interjection is the best fit so far
[07:25:42] <Me-me> I mean expletive also applies.
[07:27:03] <twb> .d minced oath
[07:27:05] <tinsoldier> minced oath — Noun: 1. A type of euphemism based on a profanity or blasphemy that has been altered to remove the objectionable characteristics of the original expression; polite expletive. https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/minced_oath

[07:29:08] <jaggz> yeah, expletive sort of does fit.. even though I don't like it and want to find out how prefacing with, "Jesus Christ," is not an "expletive"
[07:29:49] <jaggz> I do find it weird that these should be common interjections or expletives though
[07:30:39] <jaggz> I wonder how it originated
[07:31:56] <jaggz> I mean, basically, if I consider the underlying feeling/emotion (at least of a subset of usage), it's just an exclamation
[07:32:01] <Me-me> People have been invoking the supernatural as expletives for millenia.
[07:32:05] <jaggz> one could grunt, "ugh, such-and-such."
[07:32:54] <jaggz> (I like considering the more primal and simplified expression, like a grunt, moan, or much more elaborate/nuanced expressions one might make depending on the emotion and context)
[07:33:21] <jaggz> like what a "caveman" or even some primate might do for "wow, ..."

[09:00:56] <euouae> What is the difference between _invasion_ and _incursion_ in this context? This is the article, https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60061300

The entry without consent of an individual or group into an area where they are not wanted., 3. (medicine) <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/invasion>...

[09:05:14] <euouae> those are both good suggestions, thanks. I see that there's a NATOTerm database, but both `invasion` and `incursion` are missing from it.

[16:31:19] <aruns> Might have asked this yesterday, but I am confused as to how to tell the difference between an idiom and a proverb.
[16:31:29] <CuriosTiger> Howdy.
[16:32:29] <CuriosTiger> I'm not sure I'm clear on that difference myself.
[16:32:32] <aruns> Proverbs often contain little nuggets of wisdom, guidance or advice, right? Whereas idioms illustrate simple points.
[16:32:52] <aruns> I am not sure how best to tell if a phrase is a proverb or an idiom.
[16:33:08] <CuriosTiger> idioms can also contain little nuggets of wisdom, guidance or advice.
[16:33:35] <CuriosTiger> I want to say proverbs are more fixed, ie. they are used verbatim. I don't believe that's always true for idioms.
[16:34:05] <inhahe_> a proverb has a moral to it

[16:37:50] <inhahe_> not sure if there's any difference
[16:38:06] <inhahe_> except that 'meant for' can sometimes take on a more objective or mystical quality to it

[23:15:36] <Rashad> F-T-L is the three word root (rounding), MA-a-b-OO-c is the template for the object (as in subject verb object), so all in all it means "that which is rounded"

[23:18:12] <TimMc> oh, sorry, I mixed up the root and template there
[23:18:26] <Rashad> It's OK ^_^
[23:19:19] <TimMc> So, "a written thing"... a letter?
[23:19:26] <Rashad> Exactly!
[23:19:30] <Rashad> Exactly a letter! 
[23:19:45] <TimMc> It's a very cool system. :-)
[23:20:05] <Rashad> The roots are many, but the templates are not so much.
[23:20:23] <TimMc> I listened to the first few lessons of Language Transfer's "Intro to Arabic" and was very pleased with how that works.
[23:21:03] <Rashad> And most roots are made of 3 letters, but some are 4, and very very rarely 5 or 6.
[23:21:08] <TimMc> Swahili is also super interesting.
[23:21:15] <Rashad> If it is more than 3 letters, it is most likely a loan word. 
[23:22:03] <Rashad> Well Swahili is not a real language because Swahili is an Arabic word meaning "From the sea shore" which is where these people live...
[23:22:09] <Rashad> :D

[23:24:52] <TimMc> I mean, Swahili is definitely a real language...
[23:25:10] <TimMc> It seems highly regularized, though. Probably in its use as a trade language.
[23:25:18] <Rashad> Ah.

[23:30:37] <Rashad> In Oman the "king" is called Sultan. 
[23:30:42] <TimMc> I just listened to a couple of lessons, which focused mostly on verb structure.
[23:31:01] <Rashad> If in Swahili they use that word in a similar way, then it might be that they were related politically at some point. 
[23:32:03] <TimMc> It sounds kind of... babble-y? to my English ears. Lots of CVCVCV word structure.
[23:32:18] <LjL> that's babbly to you? O.o

[23:32:40] <Rashad> Seems that it exists: https://translate.google.com/?hl=en&sl=ar&tl=sw&text=سلطان&op=translate but if I try to translate "king" I get something else
[23:32:42] <TimMc> Yeah. English has bigger consonant clusters and a ton of terminal consonants.
[23:33:09] <TimMc> Babies are terrible at pronouncing those, so I get that association.
[23:33:31] <TimMc> (Which is another way of saying: Swahili is overall super easy to pronounce!)

[23:34:34] <TimMc> nasal and then a consonant
[23:35:11] <Rashad> If I press the speak button on the google translate it just sounds like Mfalme

[23:38:03] <Rashad> Arabic has rules for making pronunciation easy, that grammar and everything will be overridden to keep the rule that "no two consonants can meet"
[23:39:19] <Rashad> (it can happen at the end of the word like in the word "Qasd" but that is cheating because if you are to be grammatically correct you have to say it like "Qasdun" which in everyday life is not always observed since Arabic grammar is hard even for Arabs)
