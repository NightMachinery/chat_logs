[02:59:28] <codesections> Any thoughts between Text::CSV and CSV::Parser?
[02:59:57] <codesections> (Or any other Raku CSV parsers, for that matter â€“ but those seem like the main two)
[03:01:36] <codesections> I vaguely recall that one CSV parser in Raku passes up on some optimizations so that it can be a stable Rakudo performance benchmark.  Is that one of these?  Or did I make that up?
[03:08:11] <moon-child> <lizmat> [Coke] I could optimize Text::CSV significantly, by using nqp, but agreed with [Tux] only "standard" language should be used
[03:09:12] <moon-child> (not as a performance metric, but for portability)
[03:09:55] <codesections> Aha.  Thanks moon-child.  So it looks like we don't have a fully optimized CSV parser, but that not really even a problem for my usecase so **shrug**
[03:10:49] <codesections> Also, unless it's just me, modules.raku.org seems to be down (though raku.land is a fine alternative) 
[03:11:03] <moon-child> tbh I'm somewhat sceptical of portability losses from using nqp.  There aren't any major non-rakudo implementations; and if such appear in the future, it should not be hard to make a portability shim
[03:11:21] <moon-child> re modules.raku.org, see #raku-dev.  Dns/cloudflare stuff
[03:12:31] <codesections> I *think* that it was partly for performance measurement reasons: IIRC, we use that as a Rakudo benchmark and want to track how fast Raku (rather than nqp) has gotten
[03:15:13] <codesections> oh, I found what I was remembering â€“ in a r/rakulang thread I started myself.  Oops. https://www.reddit.com/r/rakulang/comments/m15nlr/7_years_of_raku_performance_improvements_and/
[03:15:19] <japhb> moon-child: The nqp:: ops have no language stability guarantees; nqp:: ops can (and do) get removed when no longer needed by Rakudo itself.
[03:16:09] <moon-child> codesections: ah, right on
[03:16:09] <japhb> That said, JSON::Fast and CBOR::Simple both use nqp ops because the performance need is strong
[03:16:12] <moon-child> japhb: right
[03:18:01] <codesections> japhb: is the thought that Text::CSV doesn't need the same treatment because CSV files tend to be less performance critical?  Or we just haven't gotten around to an CSV::Fast equivalent to JSON::Fast?
[03:18:43] <japhb> But I'd be in favor of someone doing a CSV::Fast; being able to handle more data formats at decent speed is a good thing.  And localizing most of the nqp:: use in the few modules that really need may cut down on indiscriminate use in the ecosystem in general.
[03:18:55] <japhb> codesections: ^^

[04:02:21] <tonyo_> CSV::Parser was written to be configurable and handle any kind of data you want, including binary csvs.  That said, it's slow as hell

[19:16:09] <keutoi> How do I load a raku source file from repl? I know of `require`, is there any thing else that does loading?
[19:16:54] <lizmat> use  ?
[19:17:05] <ugexe> maybe you want https://docs.raku.org/routine/EVALFILE
[19:18:57] <keutoi> EVALFILE is what I was looking for. use and require seem to deal in modules. When I require "file", the file gets evaluated but the symbols are not accessable within repl.
[19:20:29] <gfldex> keutoi: this might provide inspiration: https://gfldex.wordpress.com/2021/01/03/internal-indirection/
[19:33:36] <keutoi> gfldex: after IO.slurp.EVAL shouldn't we have access to sub MAIN by the symbol MAIN? why deal with a reference to it?
[19:34:03] <gfldex> because the script that runs the eval got a MAIN already
[19:34:14] <keutoi> Hmm so a namespace problem.
[19:35:11] <keutoi> gfldex: thanks for that write up. got a look at some internals.
