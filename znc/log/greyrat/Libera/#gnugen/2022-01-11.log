[09:21:43] <Orbstheorem> How normal is it to have between 7k and 15k query failures every two minutes?

[12:01:23] <Orbstheorem> There's a strong correlation between my (internal) DNS server getting hammered with ~10min of ~8k queries every ~30min and my network being funny.
[12:06:20] <Orbstheorem> My internal DNS server ultimately resolves for everyone at home (collectively called orion) and my laptop.

[12:07:12] <Orbstheorem> Funny enough, the external DNS server is doing just fine with very little traffic.
[12:08:50] <Orbstheorem> My external DNS server resolves all publicly-accessible services, gives identity (search) to all (both public and internal) nodes in my network, which at the moment is two VPS, my laptop and two other laptops at home acting as servers.
[12:09:27] <Orbstheorem> Every container and VM running in any of these will use the internal DNS (with caching, ofc)
[12:20:33] <Orbstheorem> I'm concerned by these network unstability problems and I'm having a hard time figuring them out...
[14:38:35] <Orbstheorem> I called salt:... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/270f28028b04b127c6fd8ba2b6338b07c4f217c9)
[14:38:38] <Orbstheorem> Ugh...
[14:38:59] <afontain[m]> haha
[14:39:05] <Orbstheorem> I mean, it's probably the only thing the service agent can do.
[14:39:16] <Orbstheorem> I wouldn't be surprised if they needed precedent to escalate the thing...
[14:39:19] <afontain[m]> and the time you call, the event is finished
[14:39:40] <Orbstheorem> A better question would be, why does it need scaling, can't they get their monitoring right? :(
[14:39:48] <Orbstheorem> s/,/?/
[14:39:56] <Orbstheorem> I can't be the only one monitoring, right?
[14:40:00] <afontain[m]> scaling or calling?
[14:40:10] <Orbstheorem> escalating**
[14:40:21] <Orbstheorem> Fingers got confused xD
[14:41:31] <Orbstheorem> When I asked whether he did something, he said he reflashed the box.
[14:41:46] <Orbstheorem> But that was very quick to reflash the entire OS, so I'm not sure what he did.
[14:41:53] <Orbstheorem> Reflash the config, perhaphs?
[14:42:23] <Orbstheorem> Also, TIL the box hijacks the `box` TLD :')
[14:42:29] <Orbstheorem> s/`/`./, s/`/.`/
[14:43:10] <Orbstheorem> https://tld-list.com/tld/box
[14:44:01] <Orbstheorem> It's in the list of TLDs on icann.org, but without further info.
[14:44:34] <Orbstheorem> Wikipedia says
[14:44:34] <Orbstheorem> > individuals and businesses, in order to promote personal cloud storage
[14:45:27] <Orbstheorem> Wikipedia also says “ _those who like the color blue_ ” about `.blue.` x

[14:46:25] <Orbstheorem> Oh my xD...... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/e0a1f1ecbaa69e2a38bf2b83588a6a5783cd76c8)

[14:47:28] <Orbstheorem> So many TLDs :D
[14:54:29] <Notkea> <Orbstheorem> "Also, TIL the box hijacks the `..." <- apparently, CERN solved a similar issue the easy way
