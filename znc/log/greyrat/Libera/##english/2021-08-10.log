[10:32:26] <Voxel> Why not?
[10:32:33] <Voxel> Which part, for example?
[10:33:50] <Voxel> I wanted to use it before providing an example. Like, "Perhaps, this example may help understand certain options... This is the example..."
[10:34:06] <TechTest> what's"conduct of handling"?

[10:41:07] <ksft> it sounds like you're trying to say "the way they do things is related to the way they do things"

[10:42:52] <TechTest> I'm not sure I understand what you are trying to say
[10:43:28] <Voxel> ksft, thanks, but which part creates the tautology?
[10:44:06] <twb> I still have no idea what you're trying to say
[10:44:07] <TechTest> maybe "The way this organization operates focus on it's priorities"
[10:44:32] <TechTest> which also isn't exactly correct
[10:45:20] <ksft> Voxel: the part where it communicates no information
[10:45:29] <TechTest> Voxel: obviously all organizations focus on the priorities at the time being in order to make decisions, so I'm not sure why you want to highlight that
[10:46:19] <Voxel> TechTest, it's like a header to a following example.
[10:46:38] <TechTest> what's the example?
[10:46:40] <Voxel> "Perhaps.... The example: ..."
[10:47:19] <Voxel> The example is a report of copyright case
[10:47:27] <Voxel> It's a formal document
[10:48:26] <twb> I think you're making a common mistake that "formal" means "hard to understand"
[10:48:31] <TechTest> Well, just say "We always focus on the priorities for the time being, this is an example to help you understand which are our priorities..."
[10:48:59] <ksft> very much what twb wrote
[10:49:17] <ksft> good writing always communicates well
[10:49:49] <Voxel> It seems, I asked incorrectly.
[10:49:53] <twb> Instead of "priorities" you might want "core competencies" – i.e. the things the company is actually good at, and earn it money
[10:51:02] <Voxel> Changed to a more common version: Perhaps, the way Organization handles these cases may highlight the priorities.
[10:51:57] <twb> Voxel: why "perhaps" ?
[10:52:28] <Voxel> Removed it. Indeed, the "may" should indicate it.
[10:52:50] <twb> "Below are three case studies that demonstrate NASA's core competencies."
[10:53:13] <Voxel> Brilliant!
[10:53:20] <Voxel> Thank you very much, all of you!
[10:54:32] <Voxel> Although, curious if "the conduct of handling" is even an appropriate sentence.
[10:54:41] <twb> It was nonsense
[10:55:48] <Voxel> That's... pleasant to hear! Thank you for stopping me!

[14:44:24] <huf> oh wait, we're supposed to be fine with monarchies as long as they're painted democratic enough
[14:44:38] <Rashad> revolution by force
[14:44:51] <huf> that's the opposite of democracy? wow.
[14:45:04] <StayHungry> huf: comrade is young, give him time :)
[14:45:04] <Rashad> yes because the dispute is being solved with guns
[14:45:23] <Rashad> I didn't see gay people in the US holding guns and shooting at republicans 
[14:45:41] <Rashad> why do they have to wait for decades for equality and you somehow have the right to shoot others

[14:46:40] <huf> that's demonstrably nonsensical, all functioning systems use force to keep going
[14:46:46] <huf> they have a police force after all
[14:46:50] <huf> what do you think that is?
[14:47:07] <Rashad> if you believe that you have the right to overturn results of elections by force, then when you reach the top and become the authority then how do you solve the dilemma of someone else thinking just the same as you did
[14:47:19] <Rashad> therefor you have to oppress any dissent or difference of opinion 
[14:47:33] <Rashad> therefor socialism by force leads to dictatorship 
[14:48:11] <Rashad> on the other hand, George Washington who you criticize stepped out after 2 terms even when some people urged him to stay in power
[14:48:22] <StayHungry> huf: guy believes in elections ;)
[14:48:34] <huf> yeah, I used to too
[14:48:41] <Rashad> well you were right

[14:52:23] <huf> yes, the state criminalizes dissent
[14:52:23] <StayHungry> Rashad: upgrade voting machines to start with. then think of outdated representatives system based on failure of Al Gore etc.
[14:53:12] <Rashad> it's up for people in a democracy to choose how their society is run 
[14:53:30] <Rashad> if they choose policies against their interests of justice that's on them
[14:53:42] <huf> what if they are not given a choice though?
[14:53:44] <huf> just the illusion of it
[14:54:03] <Rashad> they still vote voluntarily, no?
[14:54:13] <Rashad> nobody is forcing them to choose, no?
[14:54:18] <huf> sure
[14:54:20] <Rashad> it's up to them to realize their interests 
[14:54:22] <huf> they just dont have an actual choice that matters
[14:54:31] <huf> their interests are not represented by anyone
[14:55:26] <Rashad> then they should do what gay people did
[14:55:41] <Rashad> they fought the good fight, not the bad one
[14:55:48] <huf> and now rich gay people have it a lot better
[14:55:50] <Rashad> eventually a majority was persuaded to their point of view 
[14:55:54] <huf> and poor gay people have it a tiiiiny bit better
[14:56:21] <huf> but nobody's going to actually allow representation for the poor
[14:56:29] <StayHungry> Rashad: was it? no, it was not, forcing by dubious law does not equate agreement in society
[14:56:35] <huf> that too
[14:56:45] <huf> there are lots of people working on rolling all that back
[14:57:16] <Rashad> The average person can stare at the equations for light for a million years and still understand nothing. Given unlimited time and unlimited resources, the average person cannot make a car, an AC, a mobile phone, a laptop, a TV, an electric heater, etc.

[14:58:25] <StayHungry> veneer, i like how it sounds :D
[14:58:39] <Rashad> The average person has benefited from capitalism much much more than the scientists and engineers. 
[14:59:10] <Rashad> The engineers are getting more money, but the average person gets many things they couldn't ever make.
[14:59:15] <huf> this must be why the average hungarian lives a far more precarious existence now than under communism
[14:59:19] <huf> but hey, the rich can travel freely
[14:59:30] <StayHungry> Rashad: capitalists gave 8 hours of working day instead of 16? paid vacation? insurance? spare me :)

[22:26:22] <ksft> I mean, it isn't

[22:28:11] <ksft> in that case, yes, I would guess that it's pluralized as "geometries"
[22:28:25] <ksft> but I might want to ask someone familiar with the jargon to be sure

[23:11:21] <huf> I have basically stopped reading books in hungarian when I learned english, and I read a lot
[23:11:24] <huf> so there's that

[23:11:44] <huf> you should hear my accent...
[23:12:03] <huf> it's like a crumbling ruin of a memory of general american :)
[23:12:05] <CITIZENFIVE> What about the IELTS test? is it too different from TOEFL?
[23:12:45] <huf> I think I took one of those
[23:12:47] <huf> dont remember which
[23:12:59] <huf> I just wanted not to have to go to english class :D
[23:13:27] <huf> maybe some university entrance exam points were involved too? who knows :D
[23:13:27] <CITIZENFIVE> I've heard lot of people mention IELTS

[23:14:33] <CITIZENFIVE> huf: was it difficult?
[23:14:37] <huf> no
[23:14:54] <huf> I spoke english, of course it wasnt difficult :)
[23:15:11] <huf> a much lower level german exam now, that was difficult
[23:15:21] <huf> but then, I dont speak german :)
[23:15:36] <CITIZENFIVE> Oh, and what's the purpose of IELTS? is it only to get into a University?
[23:15:47] <CITIZENFIVE> German is interesting, I would love to learn Dutch
[23:15:49] <huf> I dont know if that's what I did
[23:15:54] <huf> I think I lost the papers
[23:16:22] <huf> but the main advantage of a german and an english language certificate was, I didnt have to go to german and english class in high school
[23:16:30] <huf> that's like 6 free classes a week
[23:16:35] <huf> periods
[23:16:36] <huf> things.
[23:16:55] <CITIZENFIVE> That's cool, some people say German is very useful, the most useful language in Europe.
[23:17:02] <huf> one year, my wednesday was gym class, nothign, nothing, music class
[23:17:06] <huf> the end.
[23:17:46] <blkshp> Not more useful than English.
[23:17:50] <huf> yeah
[23:17:55] <CITIZENFIVE> It's difficult to find a Dutch class.
[23:17:59] <huf> it used to be true in like the 90s here
[23:18:12] <huf> english hadnt penetrated yet and people were used to dealing with east german tourists
[23:18:25] <CITIZENFIVE> blkshp: Of course, I mean after the English
[23:18:28] <huf> so lots of people spoke a bit of german with an outrageous accent
[23:18:35] <blkshp> But... that's not what you said ;P
[23:18:49] <huf> but that was the last time :)
[23:18:55] <VegetarianFalcon> English
[23:19:01] <blkshp> Ze NEIN.
[23:19:06] <CITIZENFIVE> Is Dutch similar to German?
[23:19:06] <huf> nowadays, every tourist tries english, and it works
[23:19:14] <huf> CITIZENFIVE: yeah and no
[23:19:35] <huf> but I think it's more similar to german than to english
[23:20:03] <CITIZENFIVE> Some people find English very difficult.
[23:20:34] <huf> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNDtwEXQKMY
[23:20:47] <huf> the ones who know only modern english dont understand it
[23:20:56] <huf> the one guy who also knows old english gets a lot of it
[23:21:09] <huf> and I got some of it with my knowledge of modern english combined with my spotty knowledge of german

[23:22:05] <CITIZENFIVE> Interesting seems a very nice language to learn
[23:22:21] <huf> my friend's been living in amsterdam for like 10 years now, I dunno
[23:22:23] <huf> a lot of tiem
[23:22:23] <Voxel> Hey! Is it grammatically correct? "I'd suggest you wait a little bit in order to let all messages to be received"?
[23:22:32] <huf> he doesnt speak any dutch :D
[23:22:44] <huf> apparently, it's impossible to find anyone to speak it with. _everyone_ speaks english.
[23:23:16] <huf> so it's like deep magick :D
[23:24:43] <CITIZENFIVE> Voxel: I believe that's correct or you can say "I'd suggest you wait a little bit in order to receive all messages"

[23:25:01] <huf> this one works, the original dont
[23:25:16] <huf> let all messages arrive
[23:25:40] <huf> wait until all messages have been received, I dunno
[23:25:43] <Voxel> Thank you! What about "I'd suggest you wait a little bit and try once more as soon as all previous messages have been received."
[23:26:00] <huf> could be okay, dunno without context :)
[23:26:08] <ksft> it's grammatical
[23:26:24] <Voxel> Thank you ^^
[23:27:09] <CITIZENFIVE> You see there are many possibilities in order to express an idea.
[23:27:09] <CITIZENFIVE> That's another option Voxel more in the present perfect tense.
[23:27:10] <ksft> I might write "try again" instead of "try once more", unless you don't want the reader to try a third time

[23:53:05] <StayHungry> that 'suggest' thing is another case to memorize, alas. i suggest you doing, i suggest you to do, i would suggest you do. 
[23:55:41] <ksft> "suggest" just takes one complement
[23:56:09] <ksft> when it's used like that
[23:57:14] <StayHungry> i mean that special case of 'would suggest' without the following 'to'. something to struggle for non-natives.
[23:57:55] <ksft> I don't think "would" changes the syntax
[23:58:17] <ksft> "I suggest you doing that" and "I suggest you to do that" are both ungrammatical (to me, at least)
[23:58:20] <StayHungry> i would suggest you wait here, not to wait here.
[23:58:40] <ksft> right, "suggest" takes a single clause as its complement there
[23:58:49] <StayHungry> both ungrammatical? come on, it's a gerund
[23:59:34] <ksft> "suggest [that] you do that" has a single clause after "suggest"
