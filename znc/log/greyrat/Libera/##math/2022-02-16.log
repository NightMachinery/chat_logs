[09:05:36] <PlanckWalk> It seems to me that any sequence of length n ends in either on eof seven 2-blocks or one of six 3-blocks, preceded by a sequence of length n-2 or n-3 respectively.
[09:06:21] <PlanckWalk> Also that I'd say a_0 = 1, due to there being exactly one sequence of zero blocks of length zero.
[09:06:32] <PlanckWalk> But there are no sequences of length 1
[09:07:10] <PlanckWalk> Rephrasing the previous statement a_0 = 1, due to there being one sequence of length zero, which consists of zero blocks.
[09:08:28] <PlanckWalk> Also adjusting the statement before that to any sequence of *nonzero* length n ends in...
[09:08:29] <staa> PlanckWalk yes a_4 = 49

[09:14:51] <staa> Base case is give and a_0=a_1 = 0. I understand your statement "any sequence of length n ends in either one of seven 2-blocks or one of six 3-blocks, preceded by a sequence of length n-2 or n-3 respectively", or rather n-1 or n-2 respectively
[09:15:16] <staa> PlanckWalk But how would I express it?
[09:16:23] *** Quits: tkkon (~tkkon@user/tkkon) (Quit: WeeChat 3.4)
[09:16:31] <PlanckWalk> That would imply that the number of sequences of length n is the sum of the numbers of sequences of length (n-2), multiplied by the number of 2-blocks, plus the number of sequences of length (n-3) multiplied by the number of 3-blocks.
[09:16:54] <PlanckWalk> (There's no overlap between those two cases, so it's just a sum)
[09:17:56] <PlanckWalk> I.e. a_n = a_(n-2) * 7 + a_(n-3) * 6, except due to the dumb bases case you need special conditions.
[09:18:16] <PlanckWalk> So you'll need to apply those separately.
[09:18:21] *** Quits: smoke (~smoke@user/smoke) (Remote host closed the connection)
[09:20:15] <PlanckWalk> I guess it would suffice to add more base cases and say the formula applies only for n >= 4.
[09:20:50] <PlanckWalk> Whereas if you had a_0 = 1 and a_n = 0 for all n < 0, you could say that it applies for all n > 0.

[12:30:42] <friend> Here's what I am trying to explain, and perhaps I am wrong. In order for an outcome to happen to a person, that person has to participate in the event.
[12:31:29] <friend> It's inappropriate to use some arbitrary set  to determine the likelihood that result A or B will happen if some of the arbitrary set never experiences the event;
[12:32:17] <friend> For example. 700 women die every year during childbirth. You would never add men to the potential samples to calculate probability of dying during childbirth
[12:33:07] <friend> Men will always have 0 chance of dying during childbirth because they never give birth.
[12:34:43] <friend> The reason this is important is because to calculate the probability of the subset based on race, you come up with the number of black women who die during childbirth per 100,000 and then compare that to the number of white women who die during childbirth. The differences in these numbers are valid.
[12:35:29] <friend> You can't compare those numbers to the general population distribution because A) it includes men. B) it includes women who can't get pregnant, C) it includes women who won't ever get pregnant

[12:39:43] <friend> The bigger picture is that I think the CDC did the rate comparisons correctly. They came up with valid reasons why it is reasonable to state that black women who enter into childbirth have a higher possibility of dying.
[12:39:57] <bildramer> with some minor caveats like the same woman can give multiple births, or twins at the same time, how did you account for that? etc.
[12:40:12] <friend> Exactly BUT that's not how death by police in the line of duty are being calculated.

[12:41:05] <friend> RIght now they are comparing the ratios of cop-related killings to the general population and claiming its racist. But not everyone interacts with a cop in their lifetime
[12:41:19] <riv> friend: do you know Bayes law?
[12:42:02] <friend> I've been trying to read about it but it doesn't seem applicable. can you help me to understand it better?
[12:42:07] <riv> yes
[12:42:23] <bildramer> I mean, this isn't political channel so I can't really get too spicy, but yeah that's mostly true but also very political
[12:42:41] <riv> https://flowingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/euler-vaccination.jpg
[12:42:45] <riv> this is a diagram of base rate fallacy
[12:43:01] <friend> Right. I am trying to remove the politics about it. This can be a strict discussion of mathematical comparisons. NO motives, no generalizations.
[12:43:09] *** Quits: frost (~frost@user/frost) (Quit: Connection closed)
[12:43:16] <riv> the probablity of being vaccinated if you are hospitalized is 1/2,   P(vaccinated | hospitalized) = 1/2
[12:43:28] <riv> and similarly the probability of being unvaccinated if you are hospitalized is 1/2
[12:43:50] <bildramer> well, what I mean is "people will assume your motives and look at you weirdly and start banning you for no good reason", but even mentioning that meta thing is also political
[12:44:01] <riv> but the probability of being hostpitalized if you are vaccinated is 1/1000
[12:44:02] <bildramer> can't escape politics
[12:44:12] <riv> whereas the probability fo being hospitalized if you are not, is 2/3
[12:44:17] <bildramer> talk about an industrial process instead and at the end reveal what it was really about, maybe
[12:44:27] <riv> i.e. P(hospitalized | vaccinated) = 1/1000
[12:44:47] <riv> friend: does what im saying so far make sense and match up with the diagram?
[12:44:56] <bildramer> I like that diagram
[12:45:10] <bildramer> better than a thousand words
[12:45:19] <riv> yeah i should shut up :P
[12:45:24] <friend> I am working through it. I don't understand the final part where 1/1000 comes into play
[12:45:42] <riv> friend: well maybe its more like 10/250
[12:45:48] <riv> i didn't count the actual number of points
[12:46:06] <riv> just a rough estimate of how many points are inside and outside certain sets
[12:46:14] <bildramer> your estimates are bad lol
[12:46:23] <riv> yes....
[12:46:44] <riv> ok maybe it's like 10/90
[12:46:59] <bildramer> more than 100 less than 200, I think
[12:47:06] <riv> the only important thing is "it's a small number"
[12:47:14] <riv> whereas the other one is larger
[12:47:42] <friend> Gimme one second to post an image. brb
[12:47:50] <riv> friend: so the point of all this is that P(A | B) can be different to P(B | A)
[12:48:10] <riv> and Bayes law is a formula that lets you relate these two things

[12:51:41] <riv> yes you can make your model more detailled
[12:51:42] <friend> You couldn't calculate the probability that having red hair will mean that you will be in the hospital

[12:52:43] <friend> If you got to pick 10 pieces of candy you would have A reds and B greens totalling 10
[12:52:54] <friend> This is entirely dependent on the stock of the store
[12:53:02] <confuzeus> friend: i think you should have defined what A and B are. are A and B the same as heads and tails; the sum of As and the sum of Bs, ....? that makes your problem more defined. like you would need to know your "sample" space
[12:53:04] <friend> It has nothing to do with the national stock of the same candy
[12:53:08] <bildramer> p(hospital | red hair) = p(red hair | hospital)p(hospital)/p(red hair)
[12:54:23] <friend> p(hospital|red hair) is read the probability of being in a hospital with red hair? So | means and?
[12:54:41] <riv> riv>	the probablity of being vaccinated if you are hospitalized is 1/2,   P(vaccinated | hospitalized) = 1/2
[12:55:07] <friend> okay got it
[12:55:18] <riv> it's the conditional probability
[12:55:34] <riv> P(A | B) means the probability of A given B holds already
[12:56:31] <friend> so the probability of dying during childbirth for men would be P(death|childbirth|men) would be the probability of dying during childbirth if you are a man
[12:57:41] <bildramer> you can't really chain them that way
[12:58:30] <bildramer> conditional probability means "among the subset that has red hair, what's the probability of hospital?"

[13:10:09] <bildramer> that's a good toy example to explain the syntax

[13:13:13] <friend> let's look at the candy store only because I have been working on this forever. If you have two candies to choose from at your local store, and you pick A number of greens and B number of reds for 10 total

[13:14:17] <friend> If your store has all reds, you will come bacfk with all reds. If the national distribution was 99% green and a 10 reds, your comparison is useless
[13:14:33] <riv> that's a great example
[13:14:50] <riv> the red,green counts are different in each store
[13:15:06] <riv> lets simplify by saying you just pick 1 candy
[13:15:15] <riv> so you can talk about P(red) and you can talk about P(red | local store)
[13:15:25] <riv> P(red) covers all stores
[13:15:39] <friend> this is so great, thank you

[13:15:46] <confuzeus> the problem though is that the life table probability are not calculated the same way as death rates which you refer to in this discussion

[13:16:54] <friend> Regardless of haircolor
[13:17:02] <riv> P(red) is smaller than P(red | red hair), and P(red | red hair) is smaller than  P(red | local store)
[13:17:16] <riv> but just because you have red hair doesn't mean you ALWAYS go to the local store
[13:17:53] <riv> A small number of red hair people may go to a store with greens
[13:18:08] <friend> The premise was that you go to the local store. Sorry. Isn't that critical to the analysis. In other words why not use the world population?
[13:18:34] <friend> if you are going to pick an arbirtrary group, why not pick one that better suits your argument
[13:18:46] <bildramer> I mean, you have to write that down
[13:19:10] <riv> well im trying to demonstrate more possibilities that can happen
[13:19:23] <bildramer> p(red | red hair & local store) is different from p(red | red hair), because we already wrote down that p(red) and p(red | local store) are different
[13:19:33] <riv> that's why I picked red hair people that live near the store, but don't always go to that store

[13:20:04] <confuzeus> friend: you need to read on the concepts of events as used in statistics as well as sample space. you will quickly realise probabilities are calculated taking the sample space into account always
[13:21:25] <riv> I just wanted to make the point that a group of people maybe be strongly correlated with e.g. local store, but it is not quite equal
[13:21:27] <friend> And the reason I picked local store was to show that if you have a finite number of options and a finite number of results, you can only get a result from the original options. You can't get a yellow gumdrop if there aren't any
[13:21:34] <riv> I think that is an important thing to keep in mind
[13:21:42] <friend> You are totally right.
[13:22:15] <riv> so bayes theorem can be applied right
[13:22:24] <riv> suppose there is only one shop that sells yellows
[13:22:27] <friend> And I don't mean to discount the validity of your statement. I'm trying to figure how it applies when the risk is the chance that given a situation A will happen. That requires the situation exist.
[13:22:40] <riv> you can ask about P(local store | yellow)
[13:22:44] <riv> that's 0 because local store doesn't have them

[13:23:33] <friend> right...I think I am understanding this so far.
[13:24:10] <riv> P(red hair | yellow) = something very small, because most of them live near 'local store'
[13:24:44] <riv> you can apply bayes theorem to relate these different conditional probabilities

[13:48:42] <riv> they want to estimate the true population of fish

[13:49:39] <riv> from this they are able to estimate the total population, even though they didn't even count every fish in the sea!
[13:50:12] <riv> P(tagged) = 10% = tagged / total population, so total population = 3450 (roughly)
[13:50:21] <friend> I can see how this works if all things are equal. But if one kind of fish is more likely to be where the fisherman are, it distorts the results considerably.
[13:50:29] <confuzeus> a death rate being being discussed in the context of some probability models do not mean they are themselves a probability.
[13:50:33] <riv> oh this is just a simple case where are looking at one type of fish
[13:50:50] <riv> you are totally right about that thought, these are the kinds of real world things that break a mathematical model
[13:51:12] <riv> so like we were saying it's a constant problem to know if your model matches reality. and if it does what levels of accuracy it can provide
[13:52:05] <riv> like if tagging a fish kills a small number of the fish
[13:52:09] <riv> that will ruin your results
[13:52:11] <friend> But it also begs the question of couldn't I plant my boat in the place where I know that only 10% of the fish I am checking hang out, because 90% hang out in deeper levels. My number is intentionally off then.

[13:52:35] <riv> it's that 10% of the fish we did see, were tagged

[13:59:52] <friend> It tells you nothing
[14:00:20] <riv> yeah :)
[14:00:23] <friend> But claiming that it means something could raise the price of that kind of fish and make you rich, for example.
[14:00:38] <riv> if all you know is this one pond, you know very little about the rest of the world
[14:01:57] <friend> It seems to me that statistics can be used to distort anything with little effort.
[14:02:16] <riv> "lies, damn lies and statistics!"
[14:02:41] <riv> I think the problem is that statistics and scientific-speak in general 'sounds' authoratative
[14:02:43] <confuzeus> more correct is that statistics is not easy
[14:03:00] <friend> I agree with both sentiments
[14:03:26] <riv> but probabilities, bayesian reasoning and stuff - they are actually really powerful tools than can be used to make good decisions under uncertaintly
[14:03:41] <friend> If you saw someone intentionally misusing statistics that were causing a lot of harm, would you say something about it?

[14:08:24] <friend> It seems like number of people killed divided by number of people interacted with is a resonable estimate.

[14:11:33] <riv> which probabilities are actually meaningful, which can be calculated accurately and which are very rough estimates, which ones can be used for decision making today?
[14:11:59] <confuzeus> or even ask the author for reproducible code
[14:12:18] <riv> basically it's not something you can just calculate a number for. it's an entire topic that involves way more than probability, society, politics, culture, humanity are all relevant etc.
[14:12:35] <riv> or maybe you can calculate a number, but the number itself isn't really of anyuse

[14:19:35] <friend> A subset of the total number of people who interact with a police officer would be the number killed. Comparing the racial distribution of those killed by cops to the general population distribution seems like it is assuming that the cops interact in proportion to the general population distribution. But that's not true
[14:20:20] <friend> When we are told that cops are 9x more likely to stop a black person and yet not 9x more likely to kill a black person, isn't there a disconnect? If you increase the number of events without increasing the potential results, it's a problem.

[15:05:35] <putnam> Hey. I would like to map points on a map (lat/long) to points on an equirectangular panoramic image taken from a drone. I have calculated the relative distance in KM to every point from the center (drone spot) as well as the relative angles of every point from the center. The x coordinate on the panoramic image turns out perfect, however, I am struggling to think of a solution for mapping the distance to
[15:05:41] <putnam> the image given that there is some form of logarithmic curve based on the horizon to center distance and the projection.
[15:07:12] <blackk> I dont see the logarithm here
[15:07:29] <blackk> and whats an equirectangular image?
[15:08:16] *** Joins: isekaijin (~isekaijin@user/isekaijin)
[15:08:47] <putnam> Essentially points that fall closer to the top and the bottom are "stretched" and thus not linearly correlated like the x coordinate.
[15:08:52] <blackk> I think its best if you sketch what you mean.. there should be an online doodle site to share this
[15:09:41] <blackk> so the x coordiante is unchanged and you have an affine transformation
[15:09:50] <blackk> that changes the y coordinate
[15:10:12] <putnam> Yes the x coordinate is affine because I only calculate the relative angle and transform from angles to pixels.
[15:10:22] <blackk> and the y isnt?
[15:10:25] <mornfall> putnam: so the drone is ‘looking’ at the horizon?
[15:10:33] <putnam> Yes
[15:10:41] <putnam> The drone is looking at the horizon
[15:10:54] <putnam> The top half is the sky and the points fall below the half point of the image
[15:11:04] <blackk> so the y is a function of the angle
[15:11:28] <blackk> to the horizon
[15:11:37] <putnam> Technically its supposed to be. But at this point I have over thinked this so much so that I have confused myself. :/
[15:11:46] <lericson> it's simple
[15:12:08] <lericson> it's arctan
[15:12:18] <mornfall> yeah stereographic projection :-)
[15:12:24] <mornfall> well, almost
[15:12:28] <mornfall> except the ground is curved
[15:12:30] <lericson> basically you're mapping spherical coordinates to cartesian or teh inverse
[15:12:41] <putnam> Yeah but for some reason the calculation doesnt add up
[15:13:05] <mornfall> so if you fly at a sufficient altitude, the approximation that ground is a plane will break down
[15:13:07] <blackk> but that depends where it is focused
[15:13:20] <mornfall> and your y coordinate also isn't angle
[15:13:21] <blackk> so its a multiple of the arctan
[15:13:28] <putnam> The assumption is that I'm flying at most 200m high
[15:13:31] <putnam> usually less.
[15:13:40] <mornfall> so there's 2 or 3 spherical-planar transforms in there
[15:14:31] <putnam> Its possible to estimate it as long as its within 5 pixel error.
[15:14:44] <mornfall> (one to get from planar in the image (y) to angle in centered-on-drone spherical coordinate system, and another to get from that spherical to the planar ‘on the ground’ system)
[15:15:05] <blackk> maybe the lens has distortion as well
[15:15:10] <buster> there are two 'spheres' involved, one projective sphere centred at the drone, one physical oblate spheroid. this might be easier to conceptualise in two stages: first find the ray center the drone (in 3D space) and its intersection with the earth's surface, then un-project that to latlong
[15:15:11] <lericson> just transform it all to euclidean 3D space?
[15:15:17] <buster> yeah
[15:15:54] <blackk> maybe you could be precise what you mean by calculation
[15:15:59] <blackk> we are just all guessing here
[15:16:21] <putnam> Yeah. Ok lets just take it step by step.
[15:16:27] <mornfall> (if you took y to be the angle, that's probably why it doesn't work out)
[15:16:34] <putnam> Ill write some example numbers here for reference.
[15:16:38] <blackk> right
[15:16:43] <mornfall> (i mean, that's fine as long as the angle is very small)
[15:16:50] <putnam> I didn't take y to be the angle btw.
[15:16:58] <putnam> So say we fly at 85m
[15:17:09] <blackk> why is mornfall writing in brackets
[15:17:17] <putnam> And we have 3 points at some direction relative to the center.
[15:17:29] <putnam> Onet at 50m, another at 500m, and another at 1.2km
[15:17:51] <lericson> your landmarks are not in map coordinates?
[15:17:55] <putnam> Lets assume that anything beyond 1.5km distance is considered "horizon" and should be mapped to the center of the image
[15:18:01] <blackk> 85m above ground? is that relevant though?
[15:18:05] <putnam> I have the map coordinates as well.
[15:18:17] <lericson> alright
[15:18:30] <putnam> blackk: yes cause this changes for different scenarios. Should be a factor in the calculation
[15:18:37] <lericson> it will be
[15:18:59] <lericson> you transform these map coordinates to camera-relative coordinates
[15:19:25] <lericson> then find the corresponding spherical coordinates via the obvious way
[15:19:29] <lericson> and this is your pixel x, and y
[15:19:36] <putnam> Btw let me get something clear. What do you mean by map coordinate? Relative or objective (earth)
[15:19:49] <lericson> map coordinates are relative to the map
[15:19:55] <blackk> but his x axis is unchanged so it is more of a cylindrical coordinates
[15:20:38] <putnam> lericson: Right but I have converted what I have (objective map coordinates) to distance and angle relative to the camera.
[15:20:45] <lericson> distance doesn't matter
[15:20:50] <putnam> I don't see how the map coordinate would be relevant directly.
[15:20:50] <lericson> in an equirectangular projection
[15:21:19] <lericson> two points on the same azimuth and elevation with different distances will project to the same point on the equirectangular image
[15:22:00] <putnam> Right.
[15:22:30] <putnam> But what I was considering is that there would be some approximation based on the distance?
[15:22:49] <lericson> what do you mean by that
[15:23:25] <putnam> So if you have some logarithm function that can map the distance to the y value.
[15:23:43] <putnam> Which is very odd I know.
[15:23:51] <lericson> step 1: you have map coordinates of your landmark. step 2: you project these to camera-relative coordinates. step 3: you transform these camera-relative euclidean coordinates to spherical coordinates. step 4: your azimuth and elevation are the row and column of the image, or pixel coordinates
[15:24:28] <lericson> so, if you have a panoramic image, that would be where in the image the landmark should appear
[15:24:31] <lericson> which is what i guess you want
[15:24:47] <putnam> Yes precicely.
[15:24:51] <lericson> there are no logarithms involved
[15:25:54] <putnam> Let me run this algorithm again. Because thats what I did for my first implementation, but somehow the numbers where wrong leading me to start this whole process of over thinking and developing weirdo solutions.
[15:26:09] <lericson> you probably failed in step 1, 2, or 3
[15:26:36] <lericson> none of those steps are trivial

[17:08:08] <Decker> https://d3x0r.github.io/STFRPhysics/3d/index7.html so this is pretty ugly :) It's normally a sphere of x,y,z rotation vectors; but I instead got roll, pitch and yaw values, sort of generally computed from the 0 base frame... that a tip(y coordinate) of the right axis deterimines, roll, yaw uses the X of the forward axis and pitch uses the X of the up axis   (basically)
[17:08:37] <Decker> it has a general character of orientation; but mixed in there are some odd frames that are quite different in their orientation for a similar resulting value
[17:08:54] <Decker> https://d3x0r.github.io/STFRPhysics/3d/index4.html  (enable the show basis map option) this is the default sphere...

[20:57:21] <quesker> not sure where to ask.  my friend says that even if you keep the heat on high for boiling water it will never get over the boiling temp.  this came up because we are at 6000 feet.  is that true?  why are some boils mellow and some raging?
[20:58:38] <greenbagels> quesker: this might be more for ##physics but it's true; at sea level, liquid water can't get above boiling temp

[20:58:53] <greenbagels> the mellow vs raging is probably more about what quantity of water is vaporizing at a given time
[20:59:20] <greenbagels> i.e. if you're only adding enough heat to push a small mass of liquid water to the gaseous phase, it'll be a mellow boil

[21:43:12] <wakeup> what is the name of a distribution that gives probability 1 to one event and 0 to all others?
[21:44:03] <somiaj> Maybe a special case of the binomial distribution with p=1. I don't think I've seen a name applied to this exactly (though they call such an event one that will happen almost surely)
[21:44:17] <Franciman> uhm it's the dirac distribution? IIRC
[21:44:19] <Franciman> wait
[21:44:21] <Franciman> xd
[21:44:39] <Franciman> yes we call it dirac distribution
[21:44:44] <Franciman> because you define it using the dirac's delta
[21:44:51] <somiaj> ahh yea, I guess it could be similar to that, though usually that is for a single point, not event, same basic idea though.

[21:46:02] <wakeup> it's not integrable, I guess

[21:49:31] <Franciman> yes
[21:49:45] <Franciman> wakeup: greenbagels's name is better
[21:49:48] <greenbagels> A degenerate distribution is another common term I think?
[21:51:29] <greenbagels> But I think somiaj has a good point in that we're probably all talking about single points in R^n and not single events
[21:52:29] <wakeup> Wiki defines it as a dist too
[21:52:31] <wakeup> "In mathematics, the Dirac delta distribution (δ distribution), also known as the unit impulse symbol,[1] is a generalized function or distribution over the real numbers, whose value is zero everywhere except at zero, and whose integral over the entire real line is equal to one"
[21:52:49] <wakeup> so by def they say the integral is 1
[21:52:58] <wakeup> i mean, I am not sure if it's "by def"

[21:55:54] <greenbagels> Right but then any superset of this event will also have nonzero probability

So it isn't just that delta(0) = inf, it is also true that int_R f(x) delta(x) dx = f(0), which is what makes it a distribution (it works more like a measure than it does a function)
