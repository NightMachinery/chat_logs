Work by Cowling and his colleagues that is yet to be peer reviewed indicates that the Sinovac

[02:13:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> adiabatty: My response in that case changes to "that's a vacuous claim and what does it even mean"
[02:13:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> Nobody's nostalgic for generic contextless "Communism"
[02:13:37] <adiabatty> "which is worse, communism or naziism"
[02:13:45] <adiabatty> or: "which is worse, commies or nazis"

[02:13:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> Those things are both bad

[02:14:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: disagree tbh
[02:14:34] <adiabatty> I do. I think it's wrong that commies are underhated compared to Nazis, when communism is much, much worse and has an order-of-magnitude higher body count
[02:14:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok sure, why not, hate communism by all means
[02:15:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> The point is this:
[02:15:32] <rmmh> quanticle: counterpoint: the creche system was the only time in history single mothers weren't screwed 
[02:15:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> The Soviet Union had 70-odd years to create culture, which it did, in massive, staggering quantities
[02:15:44] <Betawolf> The only reason nobody's nostalgic for the Third Reich is because it wasn't around long enough.
[02:15:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> Multiple generations of people grew up in the USSR
[02:15:58] <rmmh> Betawolf: plenty of people are nostalgic for the 3rd Reich lol
[02:16:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> People were born, lived, and died in the Soviet Union
[02:16:16] <rmmh> or I guess it's not true nostalgia without childhood memories? 
[02:16:18] <adiabatty> rmmh: sure, but they didn't have much third-reich-specific culture, though
[02:16:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> Were they evil? Did their lives consist of doing nothing but evil? Or any evil at all?
[02:16:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> No, no, and no
[02:16:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> Was much of Soviet and Soviet-produced culture good? Yes
[02:17:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> Did in fact the Soviet Union accomplish many great things, and good things, and both? Yes again
[02:17:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> None of that means we have to think it was "good on net", or to want to bring it back, or any such nonsense
[02:18:24] <adiabatty> Oh, OK, I see what you're driving at. No disagreement.
[02:18:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> But "nostalgia for the Soviet Union is evil" means there was nothing good in or about the Soviet Union, which is just hilariously false
[02:19:32] <quanticle> The Third Reich did produce culture. Do the films of Leni Reifenstahl not count?
[02:19:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Indeed the Soviet Union did some things better than the United States ever did or does!)
[02:19:47] <quanticle> And it would have produced more if it hadn't been destroyed by a certain Soviet Union
[02:19:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> Of course
[02:19:53] <adiabatty> ^
[02:20:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> But "would have" is nothing
[02:20:07] <adiabatty> yeah, what quanticle and Betawolf said
[02:20:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> And said films are not nothing, but they're not a lot
[02:20:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's a silly comparison

[02:23:43] <Robomot> The movement behind the rose emoji that you probably don't know about (The rose emoji is also a symbol for the Democratic Socialists of America, and it's growing more popular by the day.)
[02:23:49] <rmmh> but the dsa is the most toothless socialist movement ever
[02:23:51] <adiabatty> > Since the 1880s, the red rose has been a symbol of socialism.[38][39] The origin of the rose as a symbol of socialism relates to its association with the color red. Since at least 1848, red was associated with socialism.[40] Following the French Revolution of 1848, the socialists pushed to have the revolution's red flag be designated the national flag.[41] The republicans, however, prevailed and the French tricolor flag remained the 
[02:23:51] <adiabatty> national flag. The provisional government as a compromise decreed that: "As a sign of rallying and as a remembrance of recognition for the last act of the popular revolution, members of the provisional government and other authorities will wear the red rosette, which will also be placed at the flagstaff."[42]

[02:24:24] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: it depends on how much traction it gets. I think of these things as like an object stuck by friction. if the anti-.su campaign can tap into even a small part of the putin hate, it may finally jerk it free and then the long-abated execution carried out
[02:24:33] <adiabatty> rmmh: sure, only because the rest of the US has stronger antibodies to what they're peddling
[02:24:47] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: one wired article probably isn't enough, but activists being activists, this may be a submarine and part of a more coordinated campaign
[02:25:33] <gwern> but if something as titanic as .ru goes offline and the eye of sauron turns to .su as where all the remaining 'russian' websites are...
[02:25:35] <quanticle> Yeah, the red rose is super dumb. People who put red roses in their Twitter bios want the hammer and sickle but are afraid of the moral condemnation that would result from them putting a real hammer and sickle in their bios.
[02:25:49] <quanticle> So they put a red rose and act all cutesy about it.
[02:26:06] <quanticle> It's just like fascists who try to get away with cutesy shit like 1488
[02:26:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> Pathetic. It's all pathetic

[02:27:34] <quanticle> At least the fascists have somewhat of an excuse; putting a swastika in your Twitter bio will probably get you banned (though, who knows? Twitter enforcement is a bitter mystery)

[03:37:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Can you describe what changed / what made you start feeling that the problem is solvable / what your new attack is, in short?"

[11:28:41] <dbohdan[phone]> quanticle: All of them
[11:28:53] <feep[work]> yeah but capitalizing sprite disambiguates

Ability tests measure skills of a person (e.g., the ability to come up with a novel idea), they are usually time-consuming to administer and complex to score and interpret (Reiter-Palmon et al., 2019). Others-reports include expert ratings of (creative) products or the assessment of 
[12:17:46] <two2thehead> one’s creativity through superiors or teachers (Barbot et al., 2019; Hocevar, 1981). Self-reports include the rating of traits, such as believes, attitudes, and preferences, but also reports of biographical activities and past achievements.

For instance, other-reports of great creative accomplishments (Weiss et al., 2021) reflect ratings of previous original outcomes such as patent indices (Owens et al., 1957), reflecting only a very limited domain in which one can be creative. Therefore, measures of creative activities assign credit to a broad diversity of creative behavior. Third, they assess creativity within the normal population 
[12:58:30] <two2thehead> and not only great creative achievements of eminent creative individuals, which make self-reports of creative activities especially interesting when one wants to assess creativity in a non- specialized population. Lastly, the large time span that is covered—ranging from the last year (cf. BICB) to the last ten years (cf. ICAA)—aggregates over many creative acts performed at many opportunities. The focus of these measures is not on instantane

[17:13:18] <two2thehead> 'According to Chen, the helicopter he was testing is the third generation he has made after the previous two models failed.

[19:35:01] <Robomot> Is a recession coming? Alan Greenspan says the answer is in men's underwear - CNN (Everybody's talking about the yield curve and what an inversion might mean, but that's not the only economic indicator analysts rely on. Here are some strange but (semi) accurate ways economists track the health of the US economy.)
[19:35:06] <gwern> ...url-encode it to 'background-image' with https://yoksel.github.io/url-encoder/ and it works fine (albeit too small). it just doesn't... display.

[19:35:20] <two2thehead> '"He once told me that ... the garment that is most private is male underpants, because nobody sees it except people in the locker room, and who cares?" longtime NPR correspondent Robert Krulwich said of Greenspan years ago. Those sales are usually stable, "so on those few occasions where it dips, that means that men are so pinched that they are deciding not to replace underpants."
[19:35:20] <two2thehead> The men's underwear index (yes, it exists) backs up Greenspan's theory: US sales of men's underwear fell significantly from 2007 to 2009, during the Great Recession, but gained steam again in 2010 as the economy recovered.'
[19:36:09] <two2thehead> 'Estee Lauder chairman Leonard Lauder created the lipstick index during the economic downturn following September 11th, 2001. He noticed that the purchase of cosmetics, lipsticks in particular, tend to be inversely related to the economy because women replace more expensive purchases with small pick-me-ups. In fall 2001, US lipstick sales increased by 11%. And back during the Great Depression, cosmetics sales overall increased by 25%.'
[19:36:16] <two2thehead> 'But the theory doesn't always hold up. Research group Kline & Company found that while lipstick sales increase during times of economic distress, they also gain during boom times.'
[19:36:22] <two2thehead> Darn noisy indicators!

[19:37:27] <two2thehead> RiversHaveWings, s0ph1a : Do your self care purchases pass? 'Related hypotheses abound, however. In 2020, at the height of the Covid economic downturn, Estee Lauder's CEO Fabrizio Freda said that the lipstick index had been replaced by a skincare item as customers donned masks and worked from home.
[19:37:28] <two2thehead> '"The lipstick index has been substituted with the moisturizing index," said Freda. "But the concept of the index is still there."'

Some animal rights activists wanted to put on an animal free circus to protest animal cruelty in the actual circus.  I'm not sure what cruelty they were protesting, because at the time the only circus left was Barnum and Bailey's, which had a very good record in that regard, but there you have it. 
[20:57:40] <Obormot\Arcturus>  They hired me to be their tech director, but I ended up being effectively a co-producer because they were very nice aging hippies who had no idea how to run a show.
