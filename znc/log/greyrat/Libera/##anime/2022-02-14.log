[01:22:35] <death916> no its not lol
[01:22:44] <death916> ppl attacked civilian cities all throughout ww2

[01:22:57] <death916> berlin was air raided

[01:25:39] <death916> if that was the case presidents would be electe don different mertits
[01:25:40] <isekaijin> I don't know if he's still there, but I think their first president was a boxer or something.
[01:25:42] <death916> merits
[01:25:57] <death916> vladimir clitchko is liek a politician or somehting i think
[01:26:13] <KatrinValerie> isekaijin: I mentioned the ukraine because of Vitali Klitschko, great boxer and a smart man.
[01:26:19] <isekaijin> Oh.
[01:26:29] <death916> o is it vitali
[01:26:33] <death916> i knew itr was one of them
[01:26:35] <KatrinValerie> If boxing was how wars are fought
[01:26:42] <KatrinValerie> He should be Ukrainian president xD
[01:27:04] <KatrinValerie> I am not entirely sure how he would do against Putin though.
[01:27:34] <KatrinValerie> Vladimir Putin is a former FSB agent if I am not mistaken

[07:19:28] <RetroNed> I never got the appeal of idle games.
[07:19:45] <hi117> this one is actually cool since you have to program for it

[07:28:29] <RetroNed> As much as I do love the 2600, the 7800 being backwards compatible is such a nice feature.
[07:29:53] <Sxem> i did 2600, colecovision, atari 5800, and vic 20 and didnt like any of them. just played 20-30 games for 1-2 mins each and moved on. the nes is the first one that i will spend a lot of time on
[07:30:13] <Sxem> i skipped c64 and dos, which i initially wanted to do. im sick of the ultra retro

[07:31:05] <RetroNed> Lol
[07:31:17] <Sxem> even nes is from 1985, which is too old. i want to get to the 90s

[07:32:07] <hi117> how do you design that?

[07:34:45] <RetroNed> Since you're currently in the 8-bit era, I'd recommend checking out some games from the Sega Master System.
[07:35:35] <RetroNed> Sonic 1 for the Master System is actually really different compared to it's Genesis counterpart. I'd say it's better in some regards too.
[07:35:36] <Sxem> yeah, that is next
[07:36:20] <Sxem> Atari 7800 from 1986, then Sega Master System from 1986, then the Sega Genesis from 1989, 
[07:36:32] <Sxem> then snes from 1991, then the 3DO from 1993, then Atari Jaguar from 1993, then the PS1 from 1994, then the Sega Saturn from 1994, then the Nintendo 64 from 1996, then the Sega Dreamcast from 1998, 
[07:37:12] <RetroNed> Although, the Sega Master System is still technically current gen! It was never officially discontinued in Brazil, and even outsold the PS4 in 2020.
[07:37:25] <RetroNed> Have fun with Gex!
[07:37:43] <RetroNed> Oh god, Bubsy 3D as well for the Jaguar.
[07:38:41] <Sxem> at the rate im going i just need 100 years to be done my 24 console retro tour
[07:39:14] <Sxem> since i also play mostly pc games
[07:39:53] <Sxem> I have 8 steam games installed: 2008 73 Dawn of War Soulstorm, 2011 80 Dawn of War 2 Retribution, 2015 94 Divinity Original Sin Enhanced Edition, 2011 74 Edge Extended, 2016 79 Homeworld Deserts of Kharak, 2018 83 Paladins, 2017 84 Sonic Mania, and 2018 Zero-K. 61 gig total. 
[07:39:53] <Sxem> I am also playing 2014 76 Elder Scrolls Online on google stadia, 2020 60 Creeper World 4, 2012 85 Dark Souls Remastered, 2008 68 Space Giraffe, 2014 80 Super Time Force Ultra, and emulating NES games, starting with the 1st Zelda. 8 gig total. 69 gig total total.
[07:40:08] <RetroNed> There are totally some hidden gems among the NES line-up too.
[07:40:26] <Sxem> when i emulate the nes, the first games i will try are batman, blaster master, castlevania, contra, donkey kong, ghosts n goblins, gradius, kid icarus, kirby, legend of zelda, metal gear, metroid, mike tyson's punchout, ninja gaiden, rygar, tecmo bowl and tecmo superbowl
[07:41:06] <Sxem> i think i added some more to my list but havent pasted them yet
[07:41:47] <RetroNed> I'd suggest trying out AM2R. It's a fan remake of Metroid 2 for the Gameboy that runs in full color and widescreen on the PC.
[07:42:06] <Sxem> i also havent tried rom mods yet. i might wind up stuck on a console bcs i keep wanting to try more rom hacks
[07:43:22] <RetroNed> When you get to the N64, check out Smash Remix! It's an expansion pack to Smash 64 that adds in new characters, stages, and modes! Super polished!
[07:44:38] <Sxem> cool
[07:44:55] <Sxem> so many games on my snes list are named super something
[07:45:24] <RetroNed> So far they added Young Link, Wario, Falco, Wolf, Dr. Mario, Mad Piano, Bowser, Giga Bowser, Dark Samus, Marth, Mewtwo, Lucas, Conker, Sonic, and Super Sonic as playable characters.
[07:45:36] <Sxem> i might skip ahead to snes and do 2 consoles at once instead of one at a time
[07:46:22] <RetroNed> The SNES is totally where single player games shine the most. 
[07:48:02] <RetroNed> Kirby Super Star, Super Metroid, A Link to the Past, Super Mario World, Yoshi's Island, Super Punchout, Star Fox, Donkey Kong Country... all super solid games that still hold up today! (Except maybe Star Fox)
[07:49:42] <Sxem> the snes games i will play first are Contra 3, Donkey Kong Country 1-3, The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, Star Fox, Super Castlevania IV, the 1994 compilation Super Mario All-Stars + Super Mario World, Super Metroid, and Super Star Wars 1-3.

[07:51:38] <Sxem> i think kirby games are remade better later
[07:52:02] <amigojapan> RetroNed: most of those are just remakes of successful NES games
[07:53:12] <Sxem> i thought Yoshi's Island was remade on ds but it looks like it was a sequel
[07:53:17] <Sxem> so i will have to add it to my list
[07:53:50] <RetroNed> Of that list, Super Metroid is the only NES Remake on SNES. Super Punchout is a full-on sequel.
[07:54:07] <Sxem> oh, Yoshi's Island is super mario world 2, so its already on my list. duh
[07:54:31] <RetroNed> Yoshi's Island DS is totally a different beast from the original. 
[07:54:55] <amigojapan> Yeah I meant sequels . But still not original
[07:55:22] <RetroNed> You've got Yoshi's Island -> Yoshi's Island DS -> Yoshi's New Island

[07:56:43] <RetroNed> Oh, yeah. Doesn't make them any less valid of a game though! Most would say that they're far better than any of their originals on NES. SMB3 vs World is the only one with a real debate.
[07:57:03] <RetroNed> Fair enough!
[07:58:53] <amigojapan> And 3d versions are worse definitely

[08:00:57] <RetroNed> I'll die on this hill. Kirby 64 the Crystal Shards is way better than Super Star on the SNES, and Star Fox 64 is a vast improvement over the original.
[08:01:05] <RetroNed> Welcome!
[08:01:59] <RetroNed> Kirby Super Star (SNES) < Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards < Kirby Super Star Ultra (NDS)
[08:02:49] <RetroNed> I won't defend Yoshi's Story though. Yoshi's Story is garbage next to Yoshi's Island.
[08:03:12] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: 
[08:03:17] <ButterNoodle> u still playin
[08:04:18] <RetroNed> Also Mario Kart 64 is better than Super Mario Kart.

[08:06:33] <RetroNed> I will say, Diddy Kong Racing is superior to Mario Kart 64, and even Double Dash. The first Mario Kart better than DKR was Mario Kart Wii.
[08:09:21] <Chigra> And Crash Team Racing is better than all three. ;p 
[08:09:45] <RetroNed> Hard agree there if we're talking Nitro Fueled.
[08:09:59] <RetroNed> I'd put CTR right beside DKR.
[08:10:01] <Chigra> No, only the original. The sequels don't measure up in my estimation. 
[08:10:56] <RetroNed> Crash Nitro Kart was garbage, I agree, but CTR Nitro Fueled was the PS4 Remake (Remaster?)
[08:11:41] <Chigra> Naughty Dog used to have so much range. 
[08:12:31] <RetroNed> The important thing is about the CTR Nitro Fueled is it vastly expanded the stage count while also making sure the controls were 1-to-1 with the original. The game unfortunately suffered from the poor online support.
[08:12:41] <RetroNed> Rareware too.

[08:19:32] <MootPoot> wym
[08:19:39] <MootPoot> you can like both modern and retro stuff
[08:19:54] <amigojapan> Like I already know I don't like modern games
[08:20:17] <RetroNed> I've got a wall of CRTs, and retro consoles dating back to the NES, as well as a PS5 hooked up to a Plasma TV.
[08:20:22] <MootPoot> I mean, your entire reason for not liking modern games is just a hill you've chosen to die on that anything new  = bad
[08:20:30] <amigojapan> And "modern" goes back to like PS2
[08:21:08] <amigojapan> MootPoot: they are boring
[08:21:16] <MootPoot> how many have you tried?
[08:21:18] <MootPoot> 1?
[08:21:30] <amigojapan> Not innovative
[08:21:32] <RetroNed> Games are games, no matter what time period. The thing I hate more than anything are the mindset of "New = Bad, Old = Bad" That's such a huge blanket statement!
[08:21:37] <MootPoot> ^
[08:21:56] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I try the ones that look innovative like Minecraft
[08:22:06] <MootPoot> most games arent innovative ever
[08:22:12] <MootPoot> no matter the time period
[08:22:40] <RetroNed> It's no different than the friends I have who would sit down and play a retro game with me and say "Yeah, the gameplay is fun, but the graphics are bad so I don't like it."
[08:22:41] <amigojapan> I remember the time when every game was innovative
[08:22:54] <MootPoot> although you would think the goal of a game is enjoyment, not grading it mentally on how innovative it is
[08:23:31] <amigojapan> Well I enjoy innovation
[08:23:47] <RetroNed> The time when every game was innovative was before there was not much before it. Hell, there was a point when PONG was innovative!
[08:23:51] <MootPoot> ^
[08:23:55] <MootPoot> all the low hanging fruit
[08:24:11] <MootPoot> amigojapan: I mean, what even do you define as innovative
[08:24:16] <amigojapan> MootPoot: there are some enjoyable stories in games now, but I just watch the story
[08:24:19] <MootPoot> minecraft wasen't the first block builder
[08:24:25] <MootPoot> it started as a ripoff
[08:24:42] <RetroNed> Innovation is simply doing something that's never been done before, and doing it well.
[08:24:59] <MootPoot> I'd probably seperate those two things RetroNed 
[08:25:09] <amigojapan> MootPoot: ok but it is the first one that reached me
[08:25:15] <MootPoot> doing something and doing it well are different things - doing it well is a result of iteration 
[08:25:22] <MootPoot> doing it first is a result of innovation
[08:25:25] <RetroNed> Innovation is also taking a standard gameplay formula, and expanding on it further than ever before.
[08:26:10] <amigojapan> I got sick of FPS games by quake
[08:26:15] <MootPoot> amigojapan: so the first time you try a modern VR headset on a 2020 pc game you will be happy with that, since that's innovative according to you?
[08:26:16] <RetroNed> Doing it first is well and good, but look at Metroid. Nobody cared until Super Metroid came out and polished it's rough edges.

[08:26:49] <MootPoot> I should put clothes on
[08:26:50] <amigojapan> MootPoot: dunno I have not been impressed by vr
[08:26:50] <RetroNed> Virtual Boy exists.
[08:27:07] <MootPoot> amigojapan: so now you changed "innovative" to "impressed"?
[08:27:08] <MootPoot> pick one
[08:27:41] <amigojapan> It was underwealming
[08:27:56] <MootPoot> so was the virtual boy, even though it was innovative
[08:27:59] <MootPoot> :3
[08:28:13] <RetroNed> I do agree on lots of fronts. Modern gaming has mostly been souless and filled with corporate greed. But then there are those titles that radiate passion.
[08:28:28] <amigojapan> There was vr way before Virtual boy
[08:28:30] <MootPoot> RetroNed: imo modern gaming is where indies are 
[08:28:46] <MootPoot> the biggest innovation of modern gaming  = making complex games easy to make ( relatively )
[08:28:55] <MootPoot> AAA is bleh
[08:28:56] <RetroNed> DLC, Micro-Transactions, and the "Finish it Later" approach.
[08:29:24] <MootPoot> modern gaming engines allow solo and indie devs to make stuff otherwise impossible or much harder 
[08:29:55] <amigojapan> MootPoot: it's like what is better original ghost busters or that one where they made them women
[08:29:59] <RetroNed> Indies are totally where the passion shines. People used to make games to make something great and impactful, and now it's more about meeting a sales quota.
[08:30:40] <MootPoot> amigojapan: what's better, a new fresh banana or a 30 year old rotten one?
[08:30:46] <MootPoot> that time comparison dosen't work
[08:30:52] <MootPoot> the original is not automatically better
[08:31:08] <amigojapan> It's better most of the time
[08:31:26] <amigojapan> Remakes usually suck
[08:31:31] <RetroNed> Indies understand the power of DLC. They release a finished product, and because of demand they release more of it. AAA Devs will make a half-baked game with DLC that should've been base game.
[08:31:37] <MootPoot> ^
[08:31:57] <MootPoot> imo most times when I went back to a old game I've largely realized I have been rememebering it better then it actually is
[08:32:03] <amigojapan> What's dlc
[08:32:34] <MootPoot> RetroNed: you're engaging with a guy who dosen't know anything about modern game dev and production - you're gonna have to tailor your statements 
[08:32:45] <RetroNed> Downloadable Content. The act of releasing new content for a pre-existing game, but locking it behind a paywall.
[08:33:00] <MootPoot> amigojapan: you buy a cake, for 10 dollars, then if you want the cherry on top its 2 more dollars
[08:33:16] <amigojapan> I see, that is really sucky
[08:33:25] <MootPoot> debating putting on clothes
[08:33:57] <amigojapan> I just want to buy the final product
[08:34:11] <MootPoot> well, that's the thing - technically both are "final"
[08:34:17] <MootPoot> its just that they detach them on purpose
[08:34:28] <RetroNed> The biggest offender are games that have Day-1 DLC. You buy a game for $60, and suddenly there's content you have to pay another $20 to access.
[08:34:47] <MootPoot> tbh these days the entire meta around gaming has changed as well
[08:35:03] <MootPoot> its no longer like - buy a game, play it , forget about it

[08:35:59] <MootPoot> DLC for indies is awesome

[08:38:18] <RetroNed> Not all innovation is great though, because we have 5D Chess with Multiversal Time Travel.
[08:38:20] <MootPoot> amigojapan: so in the end you want enjoyment, not innovation :3
[08:38:36] <MootPoot> should have just admitted to that in the start amigo
[08:38:57] <amigojapan> Ok
[08:39:00] <MootPoot> RetroNed: I've found with modern gaming - I play less games overall but those I do play I enjoy more
[08:39:12] <MootPoot> there are still gems out there, being made
[08:39:47] <RetroNed> Honestly, it's probably because he's lost that spark from when he was younger. Especially because as a working adult you have way more access to a broader range of games due to having money.
[08:39:50] <MootPoot> with retro we have the power of hindsight - we already know all the good ones
[08:40:21] <amigojapan> MootPoot: usually the enjoyable ones, the enjoyable thing is the story
[08:40:52] <MootPoot> tbh amigo it sounds like maybe you enjoy story more then playing games
[08:40:54] <RetroNed> As a kid, there was a special "Wow" factor of getting a game as a gift, popping it in the system, and that's maybe the only new game you'd be able to play for 6 months.
[08:41:27] <MootPoot> RetroNed: yeah, I remember that
[08:41:40] <MootPoot> but I've had a few games which I loved every single bit of lately
[08:41:44] <RetroNed> You'd learn to appreciate mediocre games, and praise the good ones like you were starting a religion.
[08:41:53] <MootPoot> even now, when  I have the money to buy any games I want
[08:42:01] <MootPoot> project wingman, death stranding, sekiro
[08:42:02] <MootPoot> etc
[08:42:30] <RetroNed> Exactly. Nowadays when you have money, the game itself has to really "Wow" you.
[08:42:45] <MootPoot> Half life Alyx had me hooked
[08:43:03] <RetroNed> If it doesn't "I wasted $60 on this? I have bills to pay. I could've ordered a pizza."
[08:43:15] <MootPoot> yeah, I get that feeling sometimes with some games
[08:43:18] <MootPoot> most recently dying light 2
[08:43:24] <MootPoot> its really mediocre
[08:43:37] <RetroNed> And that's because you paid for it.
[08:43:39] <MootPoot> you can tell they have a good game at the core, but then forget about polishing it
[08:43:53] <MootPoot> RetroNed: in this case, I got it for free and I'm STILL complaining about it
[08:43:54] <MootPoot> lol
[08:44:16] <RetroNed> Okay, that's a big L there! lol
[08:44:44] <RetroNed> But I feel like another reason is your ready access to better games as well.
[08:44:51] <MootPoot> its just sad how they basically flubbed their chance with bad QA, not very well thought through design
[08:45:01] <amigojapan> Remind me not to have MootPoot play my games
[08:45:08] <MootPoot> I have the mental experience of 100s or even a few 1000 games before
[08:45:27] <RetroNed> As a kid, you've never really experience any of the greater games to compare it to.
[08:46:09] <MootPoot> some games as an adult I intentionally avoid now - still good games, but sometimes you think about the effort required to finish them
[08:46:15] <MootPoot> like sekrio , dark souls etc
[08:46:26] <MootPoot> I eventually get around to it and enjoy my time
[08:46:57] <RetroNed> I have 86 Games on Steam, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, Playstation Now, and Flash Carts galore for my older systems, and modchips and softmods for newer ones. Quite literally nothing is out of my reach.
[08:47:07] <amigojapan> MootPoot: some of the best games were really hard, like contra
[08:47:20] <MootPoot> pretty much the same RetroNed with some differences for me
[08:47:29] <MootPoot> I dont have PS now, - dont have a console 
[08:47:44] <MootPoot> I usually just wait till the mid or end of a console lifecycle before I get a console
[08:47:48] <MootPoot> play all the good games
[08:47:50] <MootPoot> then sell it
[08:48:16] <MootPoot> although I do kind of wish I had a ps5
[08:48:24] <MootPoot> buuuuuuuut lets not talk about that
[08:48:24] <Sapphirus> Or just emulate, which I've been doing with 3DS and DS titles.
[08:48:38] <RetroNed> Back when I was little, I had about 8 DS Games and about 12 Wii Games. As a kid you don't think about the quality of the game, just the fun you're having in the moment. Something BAD has to hit you to make you stop playing when you have so few options.
[08:48:52] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: call me when you can emulate ps4 games
[08:48:59] <MootPoot> properly
[08:49:33] <Sapphirus> I see waht you did there :P
[08:49:40] <RetroNed> I played the hell out of Sonic and the Secret Rings and Sonic 06'. Loved every minute of it. But man, fuck Wii Music! I hated that game and my sister loved it.
[08:49:40] <Sapphirus> You just realised there is an emulator already.
[08:49:49] <MootPoot> I already knew there was one
[08:49:59] <MootPoot> but I checked like last year and it was still shit
[08:50:03] <MootPoot> haven't checked again
[08:50:09] <MootPoot> I presume its still shit
[08:50:11] <Sapphirus> There's a switch emulator and it plays games I've tried it in perfectly.
[08:50:11] <MootPoot> :3
[08:50:18] <MootPoot> oh, really
[08:50:20] <Sapphirus> yeah

[08:50:25] <MootPoot> there are a few jrpgs I want to try
[08:50:27] <MootPoot> might do that
[08:50:41] <RetroNed> Yep. Yuzu is a beast and can even upscale the games and apply texture mods.
[08:50:45] <Sapphirus> I've played some Pokemon S&S as well as Brilliant Diamond.
[08:50:55] <Sapphirus> One of which I own.
[08:50:58] <Sapphirus> So it's technically legal :D
[08:51:03] <MootPoot> heard a lot of good stuff about a game called 13 sentinels - aegis rim but
[08:51:08] <MootPoot> its only on ps4 and swtich
[08:51:11] <MootPoot> I got neither
[08:51:17] <MootPoot> I only have a beefy pc
[08:51:31] <RetroNed> It's so weird that I can say that Breath of the Wild on PC is a better experience than on Switch. No issues of frame drops in certain areas.
[08:52:02] <Sapphirus> Pokemon SS actually looks like less of a N64 game
[08:52:19] <Sapphirus> I was surprised by how good the textures are in reality.

[08:52:33] <MootPoot> gaming has become a much more social activity
[08:52:36] <MootPoot> then it used to be
[08:52:53] <MootPoot> I have more social contact with people then I would otherwise if I didnt game
[08:52:58] <RetroNed> For sure. I can't enjoy half my collection without my girlfriend.

[08:57:59] <MootPoot> I could get by with a 5800x as well but given how am4 is dead now I spent the extra
[08:58:09] <MootPoot> for 5900 so it could stretch out another year or two
[08:58:10] <Sapphirus> Built it all myself.
[08:58:19] <MootPoot> alrighty lads
[08:58:23] <MootPoot> I must
[08:58:23] <Sapphirus> For the price I paid in parts, it would've cost easily $6000+ for someone else to build it for me
[08:58:26] <MootPoot> become one with my bed
[08:58:29] <MootPoot> so to speak
[08:58:35] <RetroNed> Night Moot!
[08:58:40] <MootPoot> nite
[08:59:24] <RetroNed> With all my parts, I got it for $3000 with a shit ton of accessories, and had it built and shipped to me. This was all in the middle of the GPU Boom.
[08:59:35] <Sapphirus> Last $1000 I spent in upgrading my storage.
[08:59:55] <Sapphirus> Since I miay as well since I can't get a graphics card, still.
[09:00:13] <RetroNed> I've got a 2TB SSD with mine.
[09:00:15] <Sapphirus> 2TB NVM.e + 10 TB of redundant HDD storage in RAID10
[09:00:31] <RetroNed> Nice!
[09:00:58] <RetroNed> Since I exclusively play in 1080p, this'll be my computer for years to come.
[09:01:00] <Sapphirus> I already have accessories and peripherals, so.

[09:01:29] <MootPoot> Hello 
[09:01:32] <RetroNed> I've also got a Corsair Gold 850w power supply.

[09:01:47] <RetroNed> Ah, nice!

[09:02:10] <MootPoot> I played beat saber for an hour and now I'm sore
[09:02:14] <Sapphirus> All Japanese capacitors. :P
[09:03:07] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: had to upgrade from a 850w seasonic to a 1000w evga because my 3080 kept tripping ocp on the seasonic 
[09:03:12] <RetroNed> I've got my PC going to my desk with Display Port connecting to the 21:9 120hz Monitor, and it's got a 10ft HDMI Cable running from my desk to my 50" Plasma TV so I can play games from my Bed too.
[09:03:18] <MootPoot> RMAed it twice 
[09:03:30] <MootPoot> Gave up and got the evga
[09:03:42] <Sapphirus> MootPoot, my last corsair power supply blew up.
[09:03:48] <MootPoot> I wish I had a plasma tv
[09:03:55] <MootPoot> Too bad they're dead
[09:03:58] <RetroNed> I've even got the special Xbox Wireless adapter for my Series X Controller so I can use Steam in Big Picture Mode.
[09:04:00] <MootPoot> Nobody makes em
[09:04:07] <Sapphirus> Like it literally became a firecracker and the capacitors spilled their juice everywhere inside PSU housing.
[09:04:11] <Sapphirus> It was nasty and it smelled awful
[09:04:19] <MootPoot> MootPoot: I just use Bluetooth to my pc, works fine
[09:04:23] *** Joins: NotNew (~NotNew@user/notnew)
[09:04:33] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: they came too hard
[09:04:46] <MootPoot> :3
[09:05:18] <RetroNed> I got my Plasma from my Grandma because she thought the TV was broken. Turns out the power strip it was plugged into was finally giving out so the TV wasn't getting enough power, causing it to revert to Store Display Mode
[09:06:48] <RetroNed> I got the Xbox Wireless Adapter for the PC mainly because it allows me to simply press the Xbox button to turn on the controller and it pair immediately. It also has less latency than Bluetooth.
[09:07:07] <MootPoot> BT works the same way for me
[09:07:15] <MootPoot> Just press and it'll connect 
[09:07:51] <MootPoot> As for latency.. It's a controller, I'm not try harding about that 3ms or something 
[09:08:04] <RetroNed> Ah, neat! For me I had to press the button and I'd have to go to the pairing menu.
[09:08:11] <Sapphirus> I'm not so much a refresh rate snob as I am a screen real-estate snob

[09:08:29] <MootPoot> Once you pair then you never need to do it Again 
[09:08:37] <RetroNed> And yeah, my Plasma is only 60hz.
[09:08:42] <MootPoot> It just connects
[09:08:51] <RetroNed> Nice! Also, running Windows 11.
[09:08:55] <Sapphirus> Got 3 1440p displays and I'm frankly okay with it being 60hz
[09:09:07] <Sapphirus> Games I play don't require more than that, anyway.
[09:09:16] <MootPoot> I'm sending back my razer naga pro for warrenty 
[09:09:38] <RetroNed> I don't plan on swapping this Plasma until it dies. Once it does, though, I'll get myself an OLED.
[09:09:43] <MootPoot> Keeps disconnecting for 0.3 seconds 
[09:09:58] <Sapphirus> Windows 11? ick
[09:10:05] <RetroNed> The most demanding game I play is Super Mario 64 with Raytracing.
[09:10:07] <MootPoot> W11 is a bit bleh 
[09:10:11] <MootPoot> Needs more work
[09:10:16] <MootPoot> A lot more
[09:10:33] <MootPoot> I'm going to stick to 10 till EOL
[09:10:34] <Sapphirus> Given MootPoot is saying this, that means something more than me saying it as a Linux snob.

[09:10:56] <Sapphirus> Since I run Linux exclusively on my system.
[09:10:56] <RetroNed> I like W11 so far! The centered task bar is nice for Ultra Wide Displays
[09:11:11] <MootPoot> I tried it out, it's just incomplete in a lot of ways
[09:11:29] <MootPoot> And also there's basically nothing for me that's lacking in 10
[09:11:43] <MootPoot> That 11 would give
[09:11:46] <RetroNed> I only used W10 on my old laptop, and because this was my first computer, I wanted it to be a lot of firsts so I went straight into 11.\
[09:12:08] <Sapphirus> I've been running Linux full time since like 2015.
[09:12:40] <Sapphirus> Arch partition survived 6-7 years before I upgraded the storage in my system.
[09:13:09] <Sapphirus> Gaming ha come a long way since then. Valve has done a great job with Proton and whatnot.
[09:13:10] <RetroNed> I run Linux on my Childhood Laptop for basic programs or connecting systems to xLink Kai, like my XBOX and Gamecube.
[09:13:20] <Sapphirus> I can run most of my Windows library without Windows.
[09:13:35] <RetroNed> Especially with the Steam Deck coming out running on Linux.
[09:13:55] <RetroNed> Linux gaming has gotten the push it needs.
[09:14:07] <Sapphirus> Valve has been working on this for almost a decade now.
[09:14:48] <Sapphirus> The improvements have been incremental but huge over time.
[09:15:01] <RetroNed> I've pre-ordered my Steam Deck so I can play at work.
[09:15:20] <RetroNed> I was going to get a laptop, but this'll work far better.

[22:00:54] <MootPoot> my pp just ends up pushing the entire thing inside the shell
[22:05:58] <Bco1981> weird, top shows more ram is in use, then htop says?
[22:06:09] <MootPoot> toptop
[22:06:13] <Bco1981> top says 40mb is in use, and htop say 10.
[22:06:28] <ButterNoodle> cache?
[22:06:46] <ButterNoodle> what does free say?
[22:07:16] <Bco1981> this vm has 512mb ram, ans 470352K is free
[22:07:28] <Bco1981> while 44604K is used.
[22:07:46] <MootPoot> I dont like it when they report values in K instead of mb
[22:07:48] <Bco1981> looking at htop, 12 mb is used out of 512
[22:07:56] <ButterNoodle> free?
[22:08:17] <Bco1981> the rest i guess. since it is not in use.
[22:08:27] <ButterNoodle> no no no
[22:08:40] <ButterNoodle> /bin/free
[22:08:44] <Bco1981> oh
[22:08:48] <ButterNoodle> :)
[22:09:06] <Bco1981> says the same as top
[22:09:11] <ButterNoodle> thats accurate
[22:10:03] <Bco1981> oooh, buffers/cache matches htop output
[22:10:56] <ButterNoodle> yep
[22:11:39] <Bco1981> hmm... so this old kernel has a general memory leak? since, when you close programs it does not go down on the "top" mem used.
[22:11:57] <Bco1981> it goes only one way and that up.
[22:12:04] <ButterNoodle> bc of cache
[22:12:05] <Bco1981> that's*
[22:12:10] <ButterNoodle> all linux is like that
[22:12:33] <ButterNoodle> there was a trick to free it up.. probably not worth it unless u need it
[22:12:50] <MootPoot> so
[22:12:59] <MootPoot> anybody got any valentine choco

[22:13:05] <ImoutoBot> [title] How to Clear RAM Memory Cache, Buffer, and Swap on Linux
[22:13:17] <Bco1981> i don't think i need it. just seems weird to me that it needs to keep it in the cached memory when the program is closed.
[22:13:21] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: give me honmei keto choco
[22:13:25] <MootPoot> :3
[22:21:27] <Bco1981> you use sukrin instead of sugar, and very dark cocoa
[22:22:14] <Bco1981> and claryfied butter
[22:22:22] <Bco1981> clarified*
[22:27:22] <mixfix41> you should probs leave it when it swaps it to cache. its available. its just that having it not in cache doesnt necessarily make it better. see the free tool. you kinda want to leave the memory cache how it does it because its optimize that way. its readily available just not going to look available since the kernel assigns it to cache when you look at memory through free. its available though just you don't see it since the cache takes it.

[22:30:21] <CoilWine> bco1981: what's that, a recipe of how to keep ur arteries closed? :)
[22:30:50] <ButterNoodle> if u sit on ur as 23 hrs a day...
[22:31:03] <CoilWine> either way it leads to heart disease
[22:31:07] <ButterNoodle> naa
[22:31:09] <CoilWine> eat animal products -> heart disease
[22:31:15] <Bco1981> lies
[22:31:17] <CoilWine> that's shown on multiple levels
[22:31:20] <ButterNoodle> yea
[22:31:30] <ButterNoodle> eating a western diet leads to heart disease
[22:31:39] <CoilWine> the statistics bear it out, if you eat animal products your chance of heart disease goes up to at least 60%
[22:31:40] <ButterNoodle> leading a western life leads to heart disease
[22:31:47] <Bco1981> processed foods
[22:31:49] <Bco1981> bad
[22:31:53] <ButterNoodle> ^
[22:31:53] <CoilWine> primarily it's the food.
[22:32:02] <ButterNoodle> primarily is the people
[22:32:03] <CoilWine> we know this because we have statistics over a large population showing this.
[22:32:09] <ButterNoodle> making bad chices
[22:32:15] <ButterNoodle> and obesity
[22:32:24] <CoilWine> yeah, again, it's the food.
[22:32:34] <CoilWine> people can eat and sit all day nad not get fat, just as much.
[22:32:44] <ButterNoodle> statistically if 70% of the population is fat as fuck
[22:33:10] <ButterNoodle> then probably save to say that 70% of the population is gonna die of fat diseases like heart disease
[22:33:27] <KatrinValerie> CoilWine: A huge contribution is probably noise and air pollution
[22:33:29] <CoilWine> sigh lemme put it this way: saturated fat raises cholesterol, eating animal foods brings a lot of saturated fat into the diet, as well as a host of other nasty shit, the ends up giving you a heart attack
[22:33:37] <ButterNoodle> so
[22:33:42] <KatrinValerie> also, nyaa
[22:33:54] <CoilWine> KatrinValerie: agreed, pollution is a bigger deal than most poeple realize
[22:34:00] <ButterNoodle> if I eat ribeye 5 times a week.. and have low cholesterol..
[22:34:10] <CoilWine> show me
[22:34:15] <CoilWine> show me how you do that, without taking meds.
[22:34:17] <ButterNoodle> it would seem that high cholesterol is the problem?
[22:34:25] <ButterNoodle> ic
[22:34:31] <ButterNoodle> this is a ploy for u to get inside me...
[22:34:32] <CoilWine> the high cholesterol is a symptom of the underlying atherosclerosis
[22:34:34] <ButterNoodle> nohomo
[22:34:43] <CoilWine> if we take meds to bring that cholesterol down, the underlying problem still exists
[22:34:49] <ButterNoodle> lol
[22:34:50] <CoilWine> we've just covoered it with a band-aid
[22:34:52] <ButterNoodle> no the cause is fat
[22:34:56] <ButterNoodle> being fat
[22:34:58] <ButterNoodle> and inactive
[22:34:58] <CoilWine> saturated fat
[22:35:00] <CoilWine> specifically
[22:35:04] <ButterNoodle> yea
[22:35:07] <ButterNoodle> exercise
[22:35:09] <ButterNoodle> dont be fat
[22:35:16] <CoilWine> exercise doesn't protect you against atherosclerosis
[22:35:18] <CoilWine> look at Jim Fixx
[22:35:22] <CoilWine> - runner
[22:35:22] <ButterNoodle> who?
[22:35:30] <KatrinValerie> I heard micro plastics turn the frigging frogs gay xD
[22:35:31] <CoilWine> - ate whatever he wanted

[22:36:08] <CoilWine> KatrinValerie: aye
[22:36:08] <KatrinValerie> Those that contain BPA anyways
[22:36:12] <MootPoot> It's not even the processed food
[22:36:20] <MootPoot> It's portion control
[22:36:21] <CoilWine> KatrinValerie: and guess who eats all that shit in the end, us
[22:36:24] <ButterNoodle> it really is ez tho
[22:36:26] <ButterNoodle> dont be fat
[22:36:27] <KatrinValerie> We can't really know what all the different plastics are going to do
[22:36:30] <ButterNoodle> dont eat processed shit
[22:36:41] <CoilWine> MootPoot: eating animal foods in any portion still leads to atherosclerosis
[22:36:44] <ButterNoodle> dont eat carbs
[22:36:48] <KatrinValerie> ButterNoodle: not smoking is a good idea
[22:36:53] <ButterNoodle> well that too
[22:36:55] <KatrinValerie> Bro, carbs are important
[22:36:57] <CoilWine> ButterNoodle: carbs are what our brains run on
[22:37:11] <KatrinValerie> low carb diets need to be carefully managed and should only be used in absence of other effective treatment.
[22:37:13] <ButterNoodle> KatrinValerie: they are important for helping ur diabetes take proper hold

[22:37:41] <KatrinValerie> ButterNoodle: it depends on the kinds of carbs on amounts and also your suseptebility to diabetes 2

[22:37:49] <CoilWine> well I've lost 20 lbs since last month since commiitting to a low-fat, whole plant food diet
[22:37:51] <ButterNoodle> naa CoilWine 
[22:37:57] <MootPoot> CoilWine: incorrect, again, as ButterNoodle said. It's animals foods in a western diet. Japan also eats animals and has none of our problems

[22:38:49] <KatrinValerie> Weight is a depressing topic for me
[22:38:50] <CoilWine> LOL which "era" Japan?  Japanese in Okinawa in the 50s used to subsist on sweet potatoes, and had zero heart disease.  Now they eat like Americans and have similar rates of heart disease
[22:38:54] <CoilWine> as well as autoimmune disease
[22:38:57] <KatrinValerie> I have been trying to gain weight so hard
[22:39:08] <ButterNoodle> dont forget cancer
[22:39:12] <CoilWine> that too
