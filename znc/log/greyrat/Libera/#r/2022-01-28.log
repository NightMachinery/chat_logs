[14:21:41] <Kabouik> How would you proceed in ggplot to show x-ticks on a time x-axis only where rows exist?
[14:22:20] <Kabouik> For instance, I have a series from 1990 to 2020, but I don't have samples for every year. I would like tick marks (or other ideas welcome) to show when the year was sampled, so that it can be distinguished from true zeros
[14:36:07] <confuzeus> can you show what you have tried? may be folk here can understand your question better. i would of thought that if you exclude any missing data, the plot should be of the non missing data

[14:50:01] <Kabouik> I have tried making a function opposite to %in% and finding 1990:2020 years that are NOT in the data frame, which returned TRUE/FALSE values, which I then tried to used to filter my data frame on those years, but of course that returns a data frame of 0 rows, so I would need to extend it with NA
[14:50:07] *** Joins: usr725635 (~User@cpe-45-47-86-32.twcny.res.rr.com)
[14:50:22] <Kabouik> I have also tried expand.grid() and merging a dummy data.frame with all years to my data.frame
[14:51:51] <Kabouik> I also have tried adding a dummy geom_bar() to my plot with y = -1 (my real data are only positive) to add markers where data exist (the opposite of showing missing data, but that would be useful too as it will allow discriminating true zeros from missing samples)
[14:53:05] <Kabouik> But what complicates things is I need to facet all that too. I'm sorry I don't have a reproducible example ready, was just asking if anyone here would know a function designed exactly for that: expanding a data.frame according to a numerical variable and filling new rows with with NAs 
[14:58:59] <Kabouik> I think I will go with the dummy geom_bar(aes(y = -1)) solution. It's not elegant but seem to be the easiest to implement without creating a new data object
[15:01:00] <confuzeus> not following. are you doing an equivalent of this but in ggplot2: plot(c(2001:2010), c(1:5, NA,7:9,NA))?
[15:02:37] <Kabouik> (Got to go to the restaurant, will clarify later confuzeus, sorry)
[15:04:14] <Kabouik> In short I am plotting data against a 1990-2020 continuous x-axis. However, some years, the data was measured and equals 0, in other years, the data was not measured and is theoretically NA (but there is no corresponding row in the df). With geom_bar and small facets, they are not distinguishable
[15:04:59] <Kabouik> So I think I'll use this 'artificial' geom_bar(aes(y = -1)) I mentionned do to something like this: https://0x0.st/oHZt.png
[15:05:27] <Kabouik> Where you can see data in grey, existing samples with the black line at the bottom, even if value is 0
[15:06:48] <Kabouik> You can see that there is one year where sampling was done, but value was 0 in all samples (so no grey bar, and no error bar)
[15:21:07] <confuzeus> it does not help that you are not showing the x axis labels or is that your question? should be a labels() or axis something

[15:56:33] <confuzeus> ok, in base r, i would do something like this barplot(c(1:4,0, NA,7:9,NA) ~ c(2001:2010), na.action=NULL)
[15:58:49] *** Joins: DnzAtWrk (~DnzAtWrk@mobile-access-6df0a8-31.dhcp.inet.fi)
[16:07:02] <Kabouik> Yup that would work too. What made things overcomplicated in my mind is I needed crossed facets, so manually expanding the NA in misisng years (which are not the same for all facets) was giving me headache
[16:07:45] <Kabouik> Also originally I wanted to grey out the ggplot background in years NOT sampled, so I started thinking about this issue from the opposite point of view: adding a plot layer for missing years, instead of adding a marker for sampled years
[16:10:52] <confuzeus> ok, adding blank records by cbinding should work?
[16:11:08] <confuzeus> rbinding?
[16:11:25] <Kabouik> Perhaps yep, that ressembles what I tried with expand.grid() and merge before
[16:12:05] <Kabouik> I settled for the black markers at the bottom now though, works well enough I think
[16:12:12] <Kabouik> I was probably overcomplicating things
[16:12:20] <confuzeus> cool. simple is the best

[17:09:08] <Kabouik> I actually like ggplot, but there are cases where the obligation to manipulate data instead of plot settings can be overwhelming, especially when there are multiple factors involved
[17:10:19] <fendur> if i had to guess (i don't use ggplot very much), there's a pretty consistent set of data requirements for tidyverse stuff, and if you understand that, you'll probably be happier with ggplot.
