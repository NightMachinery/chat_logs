[03:20:26] <Joanna> I disagree with the statement that most people donâ€™t have time to make things . People spend plenty of time watching tv and social media.

[03:22:17] <Joanna> Most people donâ€™t want to go hiking either even though they have just as much access to it as I do. They would rather stay home parked in front of their TVs with their windows and curtains closed from the looks of it.

[03:26:55] <Joanna> Knitting and crochet isnâ€™t just tedious mechanical knot tying itâ€™s an adventure of trying to create something unique. I think the lack of interest of most people in learning how to do things that are so vital as producing food or protection from elements is downright insidious. Itâ€™s a form of learned helplessness really.
[03:28:13] <Joanna> Itâ€™s as bad as not knowing how to swim....
[03:37:53] <Joanna> Speaking of things  from trash every piece of furniture in my place was destined for the dump before it was rescued and there is plenty more good stuff that I didnâ€™t have the space to take. Itâ€™s so disgusting how much high quality wooden furniture is thrown away while stores sell plastic and fiberboard garbage.

[04:15:14] <jan6> @crochet and knitting, well, it's actually both, kinda
[04:16:14] <jan6> kinda like running is both just repeatedly moving your legs, but it can be much more
[04:18:13] <jan6> the principle is pretty repetitive, but you can't go full auto on it, you still need to make decisions and pay attentions to how it's coming out, but you CAN go half-auto, with something like a podcast in the background, something which doesn't require constant attention, especially visual one
[04:26:33] <JimBuntu> Joanna, hi
[04:29:15] <JimBuntu> I don't know all homes... but we have time here to make things. I like to make things, we all have our hobbies and I might very well have too many, but to each their own.
[04:32:25] <jan6> most people have time to make SOMETHING, even if it's only an hour each day
[04:32:34] <jan6> but different people have different priorities
[04:33:08] <jan6> some will spend that time watching some show, be it TV, streaming, or youtube videos
[04:33:46] <jan6> some will do programming or electronics projects for fun
[04:34:26] <jan6> some will do more tangible stuff, like whittling

[04:35:43] <jan6> there's a ton of things you could spend time on, but the problem is you have too little time to do everything, so you gotta choose what things you want more
[04:36:05] <jan6> if you have to work hard the entire day, you might well prefer to "do nothing", and just consume content

[07:08:59] <Joanna> jan6: the point is a large portion of population has been convinced to spend large portions of their lives on meaningless and often self destructive activities rather that things that would improve their communities and be beneficial for health and wellbeing.
[07:09:37] <Joanna> Itâ€™s as if they are being guided into a dead end on purpose.
[07:15:53] <Joanna> Itâ€™s a real shame that traditional skills like painting and carving things have been marginalized. Iâ€™ve seen old homes where the home itself was art with carvings and paintings on doors and walls and beautiful tile work. Itâ€™s as if modern people like ugly clothes and ugly homes with no colors or details or craftsmanship in either. I really donâ€™t get it. It is easier to make nice things now than any other time in human history 
[07:15:53] <Joanna> using labor saving machines. Yet the opposite has happened.
[07:17:41] <Joanna> Maybe without a challenge it is no longer meaningful.

[08:09:13] <Joanna> As for knitting and crochet. The amount of attention you have to give depends upon what you are making. Things that are intricate require a lot of attention. Other things have long stretches of doing same stitch so itâ€™s easy.
