[10:43:32] <mjlbach[m]> I've had some TUI issues on slurm recently so I've been thinking of trying to get distant set up on our cluster
[10:44:54] <ChipSenkbeil[m]> distant isn't battle-tested yet, but I won't turn down free early adopters :)

[10:48:16] <dre> so I know this is a dumb question 
[10:49:01] <dre> but if I do :lua local socket = require('socket'); socket.connect("place","6667") - I get a core dump; 
[10:49:09] <dre> is there an easy reason? 
[10:54:59] <sunjonSenghanBri> that's not how you use the socket module?
[10:55:14] <glacambre[m]> dre: I think you're not supposed to create sockets directly, try using luv instead?
[10:55:58] <glacambre[m]> dre: There's a socket example in `:help vim.loop`
[10:56:02] <sunjonSenghanBri> socket should work (I Think -  I had some issue, and went the libuv root , but the issue wasn't this; I don't recall what it was)
[10:56:14] <sunjonSenghanBri> but read the docs/examples :]
[10:56:54] <sunjonSenghanBri> you derive a tcp object from the socket: `tcpsock = socket.tcp()`
[10:57:06] <sunjonSenghanBri> then connect is a method of that object

[11:42:30] <glacambre[m]> Is there a way to split a window without moving the focus off of the current window? I'm currently doing... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/6415cbf52292a0f34cb9d28cae70ca9520381e12)
[11:45:53] <sunjonSenghanBri> my common thing to just mask that, is to set Cursor blend=100, then set it back to 0 when I'm done

[11:46:34] <glacambre[m]> Nice idea, although that wouldn't prevent autocommands from being triggered
[11:46:41] <sunjonSenghanBri> there'd been an issue created to give 'normal' windows the same creation interface as floats, and floats can be told to not focus

[11:47:01] <sunjonSenghanBri> can you not noautocmd wherever you don't ... want autocommands?
[11:47:18] <glacambre[m]> Ah, right, thanks for the advice :)
[11:48:36] <glacambre[m]> I guess that also means that I can't use `call_function("win_gotoid"` since there's no way to `noautocmd` that one

[14:34:53] <Amanda[m]> Is there an easy way of profiling your init.lua? i.e. seeing if there's anything in there that might be slowing down startup time
[14:36:11] *** Quits: geowiesnot (~user@5-51-190-244.abo.bbox.fr) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[14:38:07] <Amanda[m]> looking at the output of running nvim with --startuptime, sourcing init.lua takes 91ms, which seems like a high fraction of the total 208ms startup time

[14:47:56] <Amanda[m]> Also, if both init.lua and init.vim are present in the same directory, which is loaded? lua, vim, or both?
[14:48:58] <bfredl> Amanda[m]: `init.lua` but you will get an error as well
[14:49:15] <Amanda[m]> I see, thanks
[14:50:06] <bfredl> there's no good way to profile lua code builtin, but there are plugins, like nvim-lua/plenary had some profiling stuff IIRC
[14:50:18] <bfredl> (yet, we plan to add it to core at some point :)
[14:51:19] <Amanda[m]> All right, thanks for the info. Would be very neat to see that at some point in the future :)
[14:52:53] <bfredl> sure :)
[14:55:22] <clason[m]> you probably want to use https://github.com/lewis6991/impatient.nvim
[14:55:47] <clason[m]> (for the profiling, especially of module loading, but also for the speed boost)

[16:59:20] <janschneider[m]> I really like the vim lua stuff, but the documentation is poor and incomplete ...its like a workaround of an workaround, if there is no 1:1 for vimscript<-> lua vim
[17:00:31] <ii14[m]> it's not poor or incomplete, there is no 1:1 vimsctip <-> lua
[17:00:36] <ii14[m]> s/vimsctip/vimscript/
[17:01:15] <ii14[m]> the API is incomplete, not documentation
[17:01:58] <clason[m]> it's also driven by different needs
[17:02:43] <clason[m]> to be clear, vimscript <-> lua API is _not_ a primary goal
[17:03:09] <janschneider[m]> is there an api comparision available, so you can easily check out whether a command is available in 'lua vim'? ...you can really search a long time, if its not existing
[17:03:13] <clason[m]> Lua shines as a general-purpose programming language (so it's good for plugins that need to do extensive computation
[17:03:29] <clason[m]> Vimscript shines as a special-purpose Vim configuration DSL. 
[17:03:40] <clason[m]> janschneider[m]: yes.
[17:03:46] <clason[m]> nanotee's guide
[17:03:52] <ii14[m]> lua doesn't have commands, at all
[17:03:56] <ii14[m]> lua has functions
[17:04:05] <ii14[m]> you can access vim script functions with vim.fn
[17:04:16] <clason[m]> and Vim commands via `vim.cmd`
[17:05:14] <clason[m]> (well, `nvim_command`, but `vim.cmd` is usually more convenient)
[17:05:53] <clason[m]> Again, it is very useful to avoid thinking about this as an "API conversion"
[17:06:16] <clason[m]> the Neovim API is already fully accessible through Lua
[17:06:50] <ii14[m]> yes nvim api is it's own thing, you can also access it through vim script
[17:06:58] <ii14[m]> it's just a set of functions
[17:07:09] <clason[m]> (and RPC -- don't forget the poor remote plugins ;))
[17:07:35] <janschneider[m]> sure, but how do I know, which parts of my config I can choose lua and in which parts I have to wrap vim-commands with vim.cmd
[17:07:36] *** Quits: dsrt^ (~dsrt@75-147-197-198-Atlanta.hfc.comcastbusiness.net) (Remote host closed the connection)
[17:07:48] <clason[m]> look at nanotee's guide
[17:08:15] <ii14[m]> if it's a command then use `vim.cmd`
[17:08:31] <ii14[m]> if it's `:call`, function or some expression you can convert it to lua
[17:09:04] <ii14[m]> :call, :let, :set and stuff like that
[17:09:05] <janschneider[m]> sure I did that
[17:09:18] <clason[m]> and some things have Lua native APIs, in which case you find them through `:h vim.<tab>`
[17:09:50] <janschneider[m]> ok I ll check that
[17:10:12] <clason[m]> but, again, if it's not in nanotee's guide, it probably doesn't exist

[18:55:19] <Rory[m]1> if I update my configs while neovim is open I should be able to reload everything with :so /path/to/cofig/init.lua
[18:55:53] <ii14[m]> what "configs"?
[18:56:04] <janschneider[m]> ;-) sure, but most of the old plugins do not (a view of them ...if they are actively maintained)
[18:56:05] <janschneider[m]> But if the plugin is written in lua, its really hard not to provide the 'config-with-lua-option'
[18:56:10] <ii14[m]> is it that hard to just restart it?

[18:56:42] <janschneider[m]> so %
[18:56:56] <Rory[m]1> and no it's not but that's not the point
[18:57:19] <ii14[m]> you can do that, but you have zero guarantees that this will work for everything
[18:58:09] <Rory[m]1> yeah that makes sense, cause in this case it just isn't working for me

[19:17:43] <Rory[m]1> clason[m]: That's a fair point in response to the "it's a bad idea" and I don't argue that. But what i was meaning was not the point was the dismissive "just do this instead"

[19:18:19] <ii14[m]> that should just work and you won't have to do anything else
[19:18:37] <skebangaskebanga> I make fairly extensive use of `git worktree`, so having to add a symbolic link every time I create a worktree would be tedious 
[19:18:40] <clason[m]> Rory: well, fair; chat comments that do not come across as dismissive are work, and I do get lazy
[19:19:20] <ii14[m]> you can make git hooks for some thing right? maybe check if this can be automated
[19:19:29] <clason[m]> But it really _is_ a bad idea; if there were a better way than "just _don't_ do this", I would have said so.
[19:19:30] <ii14[m]> s/thing/things/
[19:19:34] <skebangaskebanga> hmm, interesting... good idea

[19:20:56] <Rory[m]1> clason[m]: Yeah so what I've changed it to is so the packer before running sync and then restart for a fresh, updated, neovim
[19:20:56] <Rory[m]1> previously it was pull, restart, sync, restart, done
[19:20:56] <ii14[m]> well reloading packages and doing packersync is a good idea, but then reloading your entire config after that with all updates and changes is not

[19:21:49] <ii14[m]> and we told you what the solution to reloading a single lua file is already

[19:22:09] <ii14[m]> require('<module>')
[19:22:42] <ii14[m]> then you can do your :PackerSync, and then restart neovim

[19:26:21] <kylo252[m]> <skebangaskebanga> "Re trying to configure lsp/..." <- the pattern already exists in nlsp-settings, and I've had discussions on and off with mj about a more generalized impl since that's where lspconfig is supposed to be heading, but he hasn't shared any updates regarding that lately (at least not that I know of). I've been holding off on doing any work regarding that just to avoid duplicate efforts.
