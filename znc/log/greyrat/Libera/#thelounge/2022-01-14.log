[01:10:10] <sslatwork> how do i find my fingerprint in thelounge to connect to connect to libera with sasl?
[01:11:38] <bookworm> you don't, activate cert auth in TL, auth to nickserv and just type /ns certadd
[01:11:49] <bookworm> you don't need to specify a fingerprint
[01:12:29] <bookworm> (unless you are on tor or some box that counts as a botnet)
[01:12:29] <sslatwork> weird. when i try, i get this error: Syntax: CERT ADD <fingerprint>
[01:13:29] <sslatwork> yeah i'm moving from znc/irccloud to thelounge, so i'm wondering if it's just kind of bugging out on more than one connection from the same IP
[01:14:21] <knolle> it isn't
[01:14:29] <bookworm> ip has nothing to do with it
[01:14:39] <bookworm> the cert 7s a property 9f the TLS handshake
[01:14:44] <bookworm> is * a*
[01:15:08] <sslatwork> 02:36:29 PM -NickServ- Insufficient parameters for CERT ADD.
[01:15:08] <sslatwork> 02:36:29 PM -NickServ- Syntax: CERT ADD <fingerprint>
[01:15:18] <bookworm> on libera?
[01:15:21] <sslatwork> sorry i didn't copy/paste the whole error message 
[01:15:23] <sslatwork> correct
[01:15:24] <knolle> you probably just didn't reconnect after enabling the cert
[01:15:52] <bookworm> /whois yourself, 7f you don't see a cert you didn't connect with it
[01:16:18] <sslatwork> yeah when i save sasl external and try to reconnect, i get this error:

[01:16:32] <sslatwork> oops well that's my IP
[01:16:44] <bookworm> ah, that's the your box is a botnet problem
[01:16:49] <bookworm> then it gets hairy
[01:16:59] <sslatwork> oh darn it. yeah it's running on a DO
[01:17:04] <sslatwork> droplet
[01:17:21] <xnaas> Guess someone used the IP for bad stuff in the past. RIP. ðŸ˜¬
[01:17:34] <knolle> nah, that's normal for some ranges
[01:19:01] <xnaas> Big Sad if Libera did that to Digital Ocean, but also wouldnâ€™t be surprising, I suppose.
[01:19:13] <bookworm> in the $thelounge_home dir check in users/$account.json for network sections, mind the UUID. then head over to the certificated folder, find the file that matches that UUID and run `openssl x509 -in libera.pem -noout -fingerprint -sha512 | awk -F= '{gsub(":",""); print tolower ($2)}'` modifying the input libera.pem to whatever the filename is
[01:19:13] <bookworm> (*.cert for us I think)
[01:19:19] <knolle> mostly aws and google
[01:20:21] <bookworm> our user interface for this sucks
[01:21:28] <knolle> i guess being able to connect with a cert and a password at the same time could be an easy 'fix'
[01:23:46] <bookworm> yep
[01:27:30] <bookworm> we could even just always send the client cert... but my guess is that this would have people up in arms as that nukes your perceived "privacy" (you can now easily be IDed across accounts)
[01:28:53] <sslatwork> hmm i'll just stick to plain sasl
[01:29:35] <bookworm> not much difference really if you have an auto generated password

[17:32:17] <adhawkins> Quick thought, is there any way to add user-editable notes against IRC channel members in thelounge? I take part in a number of 'dev' style channels where user's IRC handles and (say) GitHub usernames are completely different and unrelated. It'd be nice to be able to add a note to an IRC channel user to (in this instance) indicate what their GitHub
[17:32:17] <adhawkins> username is. This could possibly be visible by hovering over their user name in the channel. Does anything like this exist?
[17:34:27] <bookworm> no
[17:35:10] *** Quits: eliocamp (~eliocamp@user/eliocamp) (Quit: The Lounge - https://thelounge.chat)
[17:35:46] <adhawkins> Ok, shame. Does it sound like something that might be universally useful? Or am I way off base here? :)
[17:36:12] *** Joins: eliocamp (~eliocamp@user/eliocamp)
[17:39:29] <Jay2k1> sounds like a too niche use-case to become a feature... i know discord has something like this, but with discord it's easier to tie something to a user because they're easy to identify due to their ID.... in IRC, what would you tie the info to? nickname? might change. full hostmask? can easily change too. etc
[17:39:56] <adhawkins> I was thinking nickname, but hadn't considered that they may change. Fair point Jay2k1.
[17:40:40] *** Quits: eliocamp (~eliocamp@user/eliocamp) (Client Quit)
[17:41:20] <Jay2k1> but in this very channel there have been a few cases where the bot announced a new issue or PR by some name and it turns out that's a person in here but with a completely different nick, yes that is confusing :)
[17:42:42] <adhawkins> I was thinking a general 'add notes to user' might be useful to some people. Just the IRC -> GitHub mapping is a specific case where I could see it be useful to me.
[17:42:56] *** Joins: eliocamp (~eliocamp@user/eliocamp)
[17:42:58] <adhawkins> Perhaps we should make it a law that your IRC nick needs to match your identity on any Source Control platforms :D

[17:44:03] <adhawkins> Ah yes, I'd forgotten that existed. Almost never see anyone actually file it in though.

[17:44:25] <Jay2k1> i don't get anyway why people have different nicks/handles... i'm Jay2k1 pretty much everywhere... but yeah, realname sounds like a good place, but you'd need people to use it for that which might be hard to do

[17:47:17] <Hess> is there a command to print something to the current buffer/window?
[17:47:34] <Hess> like mIRC's /echo
[17:47:36] <fnutt> That specific feature I would love to see myself.
[17:47:45] <fnutt> But probably as a plugin.
[17:48:05] <fnutt> (I mean adhawkins's feature request)
[17:48:26] <fnutt> !wendy echo test
[17:48:26] <wendy> fnutt: Error: "wendy" is not a valid command.
[17:48:35] <fnutt> !echo test
[17:48:35] <wendy> test
[17:48:43] <Hess> one quick and dirty workaround would be to create an alias for each user `/notes_Hess /echo "Github user: arthurhess"`
[17:48:51] <fnutt> There you go, Hess. :) Use a bot for it.
[17:49:04] <fnutt> aaah..
[17:49:08] <Hess> nah. I mean, without sending anything to the server
[17:49:10] <Hess> but thanks
[17:49:48] <fnutt> Or just make a note in a .txt file somewhere, or whatever. :)
[17:49:55] <xnaas> You could /notice yourself, maybe? lol
[17:50:17] <adhawkins> fnutt: What's involved in writing a plugin? If it's not too difficult I might have a go.
[17:50:41] <fnutt> The current implementation of "plugin" API's are fairly limited.
[17:51:24] <adhawkins> Are they documented?
[17:52:01] <AKTheKnight> https://thelounge.chat/docs/api I think
[17:52:13] <fnutt> You can take a look at how https://github.com/MiniDigger/thelounge-plugin-shortcuts was created.
[17:52:15] <fnutt> and https://thelounge.chat/docs/api
[17:56:18] <adhawkins> Thanks AKTheKnight and fnutt. As an aside, I wonder if there's something in ZNC (I use thelounge to connect to ZNC).

[17:59:06] <jjasghar> if I had a request for a feature for thelounge, where would be the best place to start that conversation?
[18:02:15] <Jay2k1> you could evaluate your request right here
[18:02:57] <Jay2k1> the best place to actually place a feature request would be to open an issue on github, but you probably want to get some opinions on it first by proposing it here ;)
[18:05:20] <fnutt> The best and quickest way to get it implemented is to make a code contribution through pull request. :)
[18:06:01] <Jay2k1> haha, yeah, but again, asking here would be wise because if you spent days writing a PR and then we say "nah we don't want that", you wasted a lot of time
[18:08:45] <fnutt> Agree
[18:09:12] <Jay2k1> i found a place where thelounge actually echos something
[18:09:13] <Hess> is a better plugin api being discussed?
[18:09:29] <Hess> this could help people develop new features without depending on the core team
[18:09:57] <Jay2k1> this is basically an echo: https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/blob/8fcd079204f6c44cadf7fff95c00a44242a61c68/src/plugins/irc-events/connection.js#L12-L18
[18:09:59] <Hess> and really useful plugins could be incorporated to the core
[18:10:26] <Jay2k1> it should be trivial to write a plugin that wraps that code into an /echo command
[18:11:40] <Hess> also, would be nice if plugins could be installed and reloaded on the fly. afaik, now you have to install an npm package and restart the server.. right?
[18:12:14] <Jay2k1> yup
[18:12:52] <Jay2k1> (although installing the npm package is as easy as thelounge install <packagename>)
[18:13:41] <Hess> is there a thelounge reload to reload plugins?
[18:13:47] <Hess> I'm sorry I'm not very familiar with it
[18:13:56] <Jay2k1> no, you need to restart it as you usually would

[18:15:42] <Vovo2> hello, can someone explain to me which files have to be edited to translate TL to german? and how I can use them
[18:16:37] <Vovo2> I would then also make the files available for download if it runs 100% successfully.
[18:17:27] <Jay2k1> because there has never been any i18n support built in, the text strings are not in one centralized file
[18:17:41] <Jay2k1> they're basically where they are needed, so all over the place
[18:19:48] <Vovo2> I think it's the .js and js.map data that have to be adjusted then, right?
[18:22:00] <Jay2k1> look for yourself: https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/
[18:22:11] <Jay2k1> you'd need to check every file below the "client" and "src" folders
[18:24:38] <Jay2k1> you could also go the reverse route and take any english string you find in your thelounge client while using it and search the github project for it, it will show you the file the string is in, for example https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/search?q=Network+created%2C+connecting+to

[18:29:15] <Vovo2> Ã¤hm :/ :D OK, then I'll try my luck and if I'm successful I'll let you know. I'm sure some people are already asking for a German version
[18:29:51] <Jay2k1> or other languages, yeah
[18:30:24] <Jay2k1> the way i described would require running thelounge from source though
[18:30:49] *** Quits: thelounge9783 (22c8e086@67.205.143.82) (Client Quit)
[18:31:28] <Jay2k1> i think because "compiling" it does not result in binary files, you could as well replace the strings in the files you get from e.g. installing the .deb package, but in this case, re-applying the changes when you install an update will be way more painful
[18:31:48] <Vovo2> then i don't need to use it for public service and can actually save myself the work :D
[18:32:16] <Jay2k1> if you run from source, you can just change the strings everywhere, run git diff > translation.patch and then apply that patch after every time you pull the newest version (and publish that patch file for other people)

[18:34:16] <jjasghar> Jay2k1, fnutt awesome thanks. give me a min and I'll formulate my idea....
[18:34:18] <Jay2k1> the best thing though would be if someone added i18n support, in other words, move all strings to a separate file (e.g. "english.txt") and code it so that all the strings would be looked up from there, so you could just copy that file to "german.txt" and translate everything...
[18:37:31] <Vovo2> Jay2k1 - 
[18:37:31] <Vovo2> I will then sit down to the i18n, seems to make more sense
[18:38:02] <Jay2k1> if you know how to do that... that'd be a very welcome PR in my opinion

[18:41:19] <jjasghar> Jay2k1, fnutt: so here's my thought. In Quassel, and weechat they have a feature called "Chanmon" (the weechat plugin is here: https://weechat.org/scripts/source/chanmon.pl.html/) my thought/feature request would be a way to add chanmon to the lounge. it would be neat to have another frame (per server) scrolling live on all of the channels your in.
[18:44:12] <xnaas> In a way you could accomplish that with Vivaldi, I guess, since it has tab tiling.
[18:44:48] <jjasghar> xnaas, I don't know what Vivaldi is, can you link me?
[18:44:51] <Jay2k1> so a virtual channel/buffer where all channels you have are fed into?
[18:44:58] <Jay2k1> vivaldi is a browser
[18:45:43] <jjasghar> Jay2k1, yep, that would be "on top" of the channel you are active in at that moment. I'm envisioning something "above" the topic line here or something.
[18:45:51] <Jay2k1> but if you want to monitor 30 channels, you'd have to open 30 thelounge connections, one for each channel... not too useful ;)
[18:46:25] <jjasghar> Jay2k1, could you feed the logs in from each channel and not have 30 open connections? 
[18:46:48] <Jay2k1> i guess thelounge aims to be a rather basic client, so this is probably too niche to be added to thelounge...
[18:47:13] <Jay2k1> heh, you could ssh to your box and do a tail -f *.log
[18:47:56] <jjasghar> Jay2k1, ah ok, here's another way to get it in irssi: https://rak.ac/blog/2009-08-29-quassel-monitor-window-in-irssi/
[18:48:32] <jjasghar> I just thought I'd pass the thought along. thanks for taking the time to discuss it with me
[18:49:01] <jjasghar> direct screenshot here: https://www.quassel-irc.org/node/85
[18:49:25] <Jay2k1> yeah i know what you mean
[18:49:40] <jjasghar> :D nice, cool. Thanks again :)
[18:49:42] <Jay2k1> it's just that probably 99% of the TL userbase wouldn't use that feature
[18:50:34] <Jay2k1> and TL is kind of the opposite of a client that aims to deliver all imaginable special features that some power users would like to see
[18:50:51] * xnaas keeps hoping for an advanced web client someday
[18:51:32] <jjasghar> Jay2k1, makes sense. I'm really enjoying TL, and so far from my experimentation it's hit all the needs I have. You have a new user here :)
[18:51:40] <Jay2k1> as i said, you can achieve something along these lines by using tail -f on your log files, but obviously that's not nearly as nice as having it in thelounge... would look like this:  https://ja.y2k1.it/fb99545cab39e8b6/image.png 
[18:52:13] <jjasghar> Jay2k1, yeah that's a little more rough then I'd want.
[18:53:09] <Jay2k1> so the targeted user base of TL is one thing, the other is that traditional clients like mirc, irssi and weechat are way older and thus have had more features coded in
[18:54:15] <jjasghar> Jay2k1, totally. I really enjoy the cleanliness of TL, everything I've poked around in using it it's done exactly what I wanted.
