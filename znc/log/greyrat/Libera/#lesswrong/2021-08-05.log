[02:58:29] <kuudes> ggreer, over here the companies don't pay pensions themselves directly, but pay their pension payments to the mandatory pension insurance companies. you can also take yourself a pension insurance you pay extra during your work career and get the investments out when you retire - there are small tax benefits to that, in the past they were bigger
[02:58:37] <ggreer> ah
[02:59:03] <kuudes> but indeed your employer going bancrupt is not that much a problem over here, as the pensions have already been paid to the system which will pay you out on your pension time
[02:59:57] <kuudes> a reputable company can backloan some amount of those payments with collaterals, which is somewhat cheaper than bank loans, but indeed is on the risk of the pension insurance company
[03:02:21] <kuudes> the public-private pension system is a large part of public and private equity in finland, it holds net somewhat more than 100% of equity compared to gdp
[03:02:51] <kuudes> it is not as large as norway's, but it is net asset still. with that, finland is a net lender in the world
[03:03:02] <kuudes> *net creditor
[03:05:09] <kuudes> in the past, private pension savings through pension insurance was somewhat tax profitable, as you were able to deduct it on the wage year's wage taxes and got it wage taxed when you withdraw it while on pension. as wage tax is progressive (larger tax percentage for larger yearly income) and usually pension is lower than your wage, you net lower tax due to that
[03:05:37] <kuudes> these days they have moved it to capital income instead of wage income, and as capital income tax is about constant percentage, there is little incentive for the thing
[03:06:38] <kuudes> personally I see 
[03:07:27] <kuudes> being able to partake to a nordic pension system as somewhat useful thing - there are some fudges downwards, but for a median person it imo is sort of net gain and quite trustworthy
[03:07:58] <kuudes> though we have memetic contagion from usa and social media over my age workers never getting any pension out etc
[03:09:03] <kuudes> more appropriate worry would be less freedom than us system

[04:12:51] <catern> otoburb: (because it doesn't need one - AGPL doesn't actually intend to expand copyleft to cover distributed systems, because this kind of composition wasn't really anticipated at the time)
[04:13:11] <otoburb> catern: Right -- hence why I believe this type of argumentation leans towards an even more viral version of AGPL
[04:13:22] <catern> adiabatic: the systems linking exception of the GPL is extremely important. you couldn't use GPL applications on Windows if you didn't have it
[04:13:34] <adiabatic> catern: I said *L*GPL
[04:14:07] <adiabatic> an LGPLed Python library that expects you to subclass it to use it is basically GPLed from what Iunderstand
[04:15:01] <catern> sure, I don't think the LGPL is super relevant here, the GPL systems linking exemption has nothing to do with how the LGPL treats linking
[04:15:06] <catern> anyway

[04:15:39] <quanticle> "In my experience, this is often wrong. These systems can be run locally during development with a relatively small investment of effort."
[04:15:41] <quanticle> http://catern.com/run.html
[04:15:41] <Robomot> You need to be able to run your system
[04:15:43] <quanticle> No, catern, you're wrong. Getting the system running on a single host tells you nothing about, for example, how the system will behave under network congestion. Or how it will behave under the load of production traffic. Or what it will do when the disk on on the DB server gets full. All running the system locally tells you is the exact same information you could have gotten with well designed
[04:15:45] <quanticle> mocks or a shared dev environment: have I introduced any API changes that fuck over other components.
[04:16:24] <catern> quanticle: okay? does that have anything to do with what you just quoted?
[04:16:41] <quanticle> You keep going on about how it's important to run your system
[04:16:44] <quanticle> But it's not
[04:16:49] <quanticle> It's not important at all
[04:17:01] <quanticle> You get no information from it that you wouldn't get via methods that cost far less
[04:17:10] <otoburb> quanticle: And to extend catern's point about being able to "run your (distributed) system", that's exactly where I would think strong copyleft for a distributed stack precludes the ability to run on a proprietary cloud platform
[04:17:49] <catern> otoburb: why do you think it precludes that? that's explicit point of the systems linking exemption I mentioned. do you not think that would work?
[04:17:52] <otoburb> ... without said proprietary platform sharing their code too. It's almost as if we need the entire stack to be shared from ABC point onwards
[04:17:53] <quanticle> Like, great, I got all these docker containers running on localhost... yay? I have expended significant effort to do this, and I still don't know anything about how production will behave.
[04:18:28] <meowcat> if you have twenty microservices involved in handling a user query, it can be nontrivial just to verify that they're all speaking to each other.
[04:18:35] <catern> quanticle: okay... you're kind of just contradicting me
[04:18:39] <quanticle> My time spent at Amazon and Microsoft, working on actually large systems has taught me one thing: only prod behaves like prod. 
[04:18:41] <otoburb> catern: Based on your persuasive argument (which I agree with) that it's very difficult to run distributed systems without forcing more openness, I think such an exemption would not work
[04:18:52] <catern> quanticle: it sounds like you're suffering from sour grapes :)
[04:19:37] <quanticle> catern: No, I'm just surprised you said such an idiotic thing, which is contradicted by experience so easily.
[04:19:39] <otoburb> Because what makes the distributed systems run as they do (right now) is that secret sauce coming from the rube goldberg cloud stacks
[04:20:34] <quanticle> In practice, you don't need to run the entire system, and frankly, oftentimes, you shouldn't
[04:21:01] <catern> otoburb: hmm, that's fair, but I think the same argument applies for open source built on proprietary operating systems - which was how GNU started, too
[04:21:13] <meowcat> sometimes your system talks to three other teams' systems and if you raise too much fuss about their performance, they try to foist off their peripheral services on you
[04:21:25] <catern> otoburb: you couldn't, e.g., run your GNU utilities without a C compiler and C library, which they didn't have from the start
[04:21:34] <catern> otoburb: (a free C compiler and C library I mean)
[04:22:12] <meowcat> "we need spellchecking to run faster so that we can use it for ads" "we don't support performance guarantees on spellchecking, do you want to own it?" "it will make $BIG revenue per year, so... i guess so?"
[04:22:37] <catern> otoburb: also, while I agree that some orgs are very dependent on proprietary cloud services, there are lots of orgs that *aren't* - Google et al, for example
[04:22:46] <catern> (since they're the ones providing the cloud services)
[04:23:11] <saturn2> open source wouldn't make much sense without standardized computers, but there aren't any standardized distributed systems
[04:23:14] <otoburb> catern: I see your point; but I'd also argue that the incentives way back then were different and people couldn't see how things would unfold; now we have a better understanding of how greedy corporations are. 
[04:23:26] <otoburb> ^--- what saturn2 said
[04:23:50] <saturn2> the state of the art is closer to general-purpose computers in the 1950s and early 1960s, where everything was a one-off
[04:23:52] <otoburb> s/greedy corporations are/economics
[04:24:09] <catern> otoburb: but maybe one could say it's utopian to imagine that the big vendors will open source their systems - that's not how it happened with the Unix vendors back then - but, still, I think starting from "we can run an open distributed system but it depends on proprietary APIs" is an OK place to start
[04:24:16] <meowcat> the vax people still insist that they did it right in the '80s
[04:24:20] <catern> otoburb: it's a valid concern, though
[04:24:53] <otoburb> catern: I think you're just so much more optimistic than I am. I hope you're right. 
[04:24:55] <catern> saturn2: yes, I quite agree (although I think that's dangerously close to saying "...and therefore the solution is to make a standardized distributed system" which I think won't work out)
[04:25:30] <otoburb> Why not? Aren't we in the "every ISA for themselves!" phase of distributed systems? 
[04:26:07] <catern> otoburb: yeah, but we didn't leave that era by getting together at ISO and making a standard
[04:26:31] <catern> the panopoly of incompatible Unices wasn't eliminated by POSIX
[04:26:37] <catern> it was eliminated by Linux
[04:26:45] <otoburb> Err... I would argue it was eliminated by Wintel
[04:26:52] <catern> well, yeah, that too :)
[04:26:56] <catern> both of them :)
[04:26:59] <meowcat> otoburb: no, more like the "every micro has a Z80 in it, but that doesn't mean you can run TRS-80 software on your DEC Rainbow
[04:27:07] <meowcat> era"
[04:27:10] <catern> but, Linux, one system that isn't attempting to be standard or anything - but just is available for free and easy enough to run
[04:27:50] <catern> I think you could argue that the dominance of x86/Intel is the same kind of story

[04:29:41] <otoburb> But they're (pseudo) standards
[04:29:41] <meowcat> similarly, complaints about docker seem similar to complaints about IBM JCL
[04:29:57] <catern> otoburb: yeah but there's no big committee of different companies getting together and making something for everyone
[04:30:17] <catern> otoburb: they're just written (or at least they were) by a few people implementing something they think works. I guess it's changed today
[04:30:28] <catern> but the important RFCs worked that way

[04:38:12] <catern> quanticle: yes. you probably have all kinds of monitoring and web UIs etc for that system. you're creating a system that provides a service, but I can't run my own copy of that system. which means there's no open source feedback improvement loop, hence my article...

[04:43:21] <catern> quanticle: there's a decent amount of old and thriving GPL application software out there that is robust and useful and used by end-users (obviously the GPL is less popular for new software today, but then people aren't really writing new software, they're writing services), but there's no such services/distributed systems - why not? I think it's because of the reasons I outline in the article: if you write a single service/distribut

[05:01:50] *** Joins: ua_ (~ua@public-gprs222822.centertel.pl)
[05:02:37] <quanticle> Anyway, the reason I'm saying it is that I've seen *more than one* team spend developer-weeks doing exactly what you've prescribed: make everything locally runnable, and then it turns out that it didn't actually stop any of the problems they were having. Just a total waste of effort all in the name of a misguided sense of aesthetics.
[05:04:15] <catern> why wasn't their system runnable in the first place? didn't they have to run it in production? why didn't they just use that same code?
[05:04:17] <meowcat> every developer account is allowed to send 1 qps of requests to any service, with exceptions for security and billing.  any service that cannot tolerate some random crap traffic from developers is insufficiently robust to dumb bullshit that just happens.
[05:04:47] <meowcat> because eventually someone will misconfigure their new service in production and send you random crap traffic anyway.
[05:05:15] <quanticle> catern: Because it depended on upstream cloud services, like Azure DocumentDB
[05:05:28] <catern> stop using proprietary cloud services

[05:07:53] <quanticle> More like, rolling my eyes at this stupid person who thinks that testing code against a localhost copy is somehow any more informative than testing code against a well designed mock
[05:08:49] <catern> rolling my eyes at this sadly misinformed person who for some reason thinks it's a good idea to implement all your code twice
[05:09:10] <quanticle> Why does a mock have to be a full reimplementation?
[05:09:54] <catern> do you equivalence-test your mock and your real implementation?
[05:10:35] <quanticle> Yes? Like, if the mock and the real implementation varied, the code would break as soon as it got into dev
[05:10:43] <quanticle> The code is the equivalence test
[05:10:49] <catern> lol
[05:11:14] <catern> "dev", such primitive development practices
[05:11:35] <quanticle> Yeah, god forbid our development practices don't meet your highly refined sense of aesthetics
[05:11:54] <catern> well, I know you've worked only at companies with really low-quality technology but if you want to work somewhere with good technology, we're hiring :)
[05:12:00] <quanticle> "They have a dev environment ew"
[05:12:22] <quanticle> You mean, if I want to work somewhere where aesthetics trumps doing work
[05:12:30] <quanticle> Yeah, I've worked at enough places like that
[05:12:43] <quanticle> I don't need one more on my resume
[05:13:56] <catern> (I was mainly just insulting Amazon and Microsoft to be clear)
[05:16:17] <quanticle> Sure, but if you're going to insult them, at least choose a good insult. This whole "run the entire stack locally" nonsense is just a canard. As if being able to run the entire stack locally doesn't come with architectural tradeoffs of its own. And even if you could, running the entire stack on one machine tells you very little about how the system will behave when it's distributed across
[05:16:18] <quanticle> thousands of machines.
[05:16:35] <quanticle> It just gives you warm fuzzies
[05:16:35] <catern> it means you don't have to waste your time on implementing useless mocks, for one
[05:17:00] <catern> i like to get work done sorry, I don't have time to mock
[05:17:20] <quanticle> You can do things with the mocks that you can't do with real services. Like inject slowness or make them return errors 
[05:17:37] <catern> you can do that with real services too
[05:17:42] <quanticle> It's a lot harder
[05:17:46] <nshepperd> imagine having a stack. gross
[05:17:59] <catern> quanticle: nuh uh
[05:18:03] <quanticle> Imagine running your code on an OS. Ew
[05:18:39] <quanticle> catern: Uh, okay, well, I'll let you get back to modifying Postgres' internals to make your local DB sever be slow and simulate network errors
[05:19:01] <quanticle> Very productive use of time
[05:19:15] <catern> quanticle: could you consider that maybe you don't know everything? here's a knowledge dump for you: read this manpage https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/tc-netem.8.html
[05:19:16] <Robomot> tc-netem(8) - Linux manual page
[05:20:05] <quanticle> Okay, and this simulates high CPU load on the DB server how?
[05:20:24] <quanticle> Also, why can't I use this with a dev environment?
[05:20:33] <quanticle> You've defeated your own argument
[05:21:12] <catern> "you can't do X when running things locally" "yes you can, you do Y" "well uh you can also do Y in a dev environment, checkmate"
[05:21:53] <quanticle> Yes, well, why bother getting it running locally then?
[05:22:00] <quanticle> Literally just... keep doing what you were doing
[05:22:21] <quanticle> Like, I haven't run a local copy of our app in *ages*
[05:22:42] <quanticle> I just run the front-end and point it at the dev env's service endpoints
[05:22:47] <quanticle> And it's *fine*
[05:22:57] <catern> so you agree with me then? mocks are useless?
[05:23:33] <quanticle> No, because if I need to simulate something, I'll mock that endpoint specifically with a Python server running on localhost
[05:23:40] <quanticle> But I don't need a mock of everything at the same time
[05:23:50] <quanticle> And I don't need the mock all the time
[05:23:53] <catern> sounds expensive, I just run the real thing
[05:23:58] <catern> much easier
[05:24:29] <quanticle> So you have to maintain yet another set of deployment scripts, and deal with shit breaking on your machine when it works in dev?
[05:24:31] <quanticle> Sound expensive
[05:24:44] <catern> nope *taps sign* http://catern.com/integration.html

[05:25:26] <catern> that's one of the stages of grief

[05:48:21] <quanticle> catern: Okay, so after rereading /integration.htm, you're just setting up a mock
[05:48:25] <quanticle> And calling it a real system

[05:48:44] <meowcat> how much real-system code can your mock run before it's no longer a mock, though?
[05:48:51] <catern> mm, I don't think that's what I'm doing, but ok
[05:48:54] <quanticle> Code matters less than *data*

[05:50:05] <Robomot> Query: Wetlands (ID: 0)
[05:50:12] <quanticle> How does your approach handle my use case?
[05:50:30] <catern> you can mock that
[05:50:50] <catern> that is, mock the US Fish and Wildlife Service's API
[05:51:22] <catern> although I wouldn't approach it as writing a "mock", but rather as writing your own implementation of that API
[05:51:28] <catern> for bonus points, open source that implementation
[05:51:39] <quanticle> Right, but the implementation is useless without the *data*
[05:52:08] <quanticle> So yeah, I can (and do) mock the service, but I don't pretend I have the "whole thing" running on my machine
[05:52:14] <quanticle> Nor do I pretend that such a thing is possible

[12:45:15] <shawwwn> your cognitive dissonance is interesting to observe over the years. you're free of most of it (moreso than most people here, including me) but you have your own unique blend.
[12:46:00] <shawwwn> for example, you seem to want popularity, but you also go out of your way to intentionally do the opposite of whatever would generate popularity
[12:46:24] <shawwwn> I may or may not still be hung up on your twitter bio
[12:47:08] <shawwwn> you do such amazing work. I get sad sometimes that no one notices
[12:47:15] <shawwwn> but you don't want people to notice, for some reason
[12:47:25] <PapuaHardyNet> nshepperd2 shawwwn: "I-it's not like I want you to appreciate my work or anything, b-baka!"
[12:49:07] <PapuaHardyNet> btw shawwwn, have you ever used einops library?
[12:49:51] <nshepperd2> I'm more interested in sharing my work with people I consider my friends, than "popularity"
[12:50:14] <Gurkenglas> nshepperd2, the way utility function aggregation works, if an event would move one additional person in a million from approving of a world to disapproving of it, we shouldn't just disregard that. That is to say, did you have to go and ask the SOTA neural net to give its best shot of modelling large amounts of suffering electrons
[12:50:24] <PapuaHardyNet> I read of some impressive improvement in performance and memory footprint in comparison to pytorch, which supposedly comes from removing the python filler and replacing most of it with matrix operations a la einsum, but I tried digging through the einops library, and saw very little einsum, which does seem strange. And yet, the testimonies for einops are pretty impressive
[12:50:47] <PapuaHardyNet> anyway, I'm trying out einops vs only pytorch and report my findings
[12:51:09] <shawwwn> unfortunately, I have a keen eye at spotting the dissonance. And the dissonance is that if that were true, you wouldn't bother with twitter at all. All your friends are here
[12:51:16] <nshepperd2> Gurkenglas: don't be silly

[12:51:49] <nshepperd2> 'final solution'
[12:52:13] <Gurkenglas> nshepperd2, i agree that it is silly but "don't be silly" is not actually a decision rule we can make global and survive
[12:52:45] <Gurkenglas> (or perhaps, it decreases our expected chances by like 20%?)
[12:53:58] <PapuaHardyNet> the final solution is obviously jax acc to shawn
[12:54:33] <PapuaHardyNet> which is why i'm thinking to *also* build a jax equivalent and compare all three: pytorch, pytorch + einops, jax. Let's see if I have the bandwidth to do so
[12:54:46] <nshepperd2> einops is really cool imo
[12:54:47] <shawwwn> two out of two germans prefer it over tensorflow, in my experience
[12:55:18] <nshepperd2> if there's a performance benefit, it's probably just from operation fusion
[12:55:25] <shawwwn> that sounds like a great thing to do. you should.
[12:55:59] <shawwwn> you'll learn a lot. it's easy to hear "the bottlenecks are in unexpected places", but quite another thing to find them
[12:56:06] <nshepperd2> like you can do something in one rearrange that would take a reshape, reduce, transpose, then another reshape
[12:56:13] <PapuaHardyNet> all right, will prioritize this
[12:56:29] <shawwwn> well, no. don't do it because it's important. do it because it's fun
[12:56:32] <nshepperd2> jax.jit might well do this fusion itself
[12:56:51] <shawwwn> it's actually XLA, not jax
[12:57:08] <shawwwn> jax directly spits out an XLA graph. But the graph is optimized by libtpu, which is where the real magic happens
[12:57:22] <shawwwn> that's why they only ship obfuscated binaries (apparently) for libtpu
[12:57:22] <nshepperd2> but einops over jax would still be a superior ui to tensor.permute(<incomprehensible numbers>)

[12:57:47] <Gurkenglas> there's no objective answer to what counts as a moral patient, all we have is opinions. and if everyone acts according to their own opinions it doesnt end well, we need to put at least like 0.1% measure on everyone else's opinions. and you don't aggregate utility functions by taking expectations, that's not invariant under affine transformations, so indeed you're not compelled to obey whoever can think up the 
[12:57:47] <Gurkenglas> highest number, but it does implore you to costlessly adjust behavior to switch minimum utility worlds to 1 utility worlds

[12:58:57] <shawwwn> I didn't expect to feel this way, but in my opinion this is the simplest, clearest self attention implementation I've ever seen
[12:59:21] <shawwwn> not for humans, but for "people who are just trying to figure out what the fuck the shape of any given variable is"
[12:59:27] <shawwwn> so for humans, I guess.
[13:00:14] <shawwwn> I also didn't expect to *like* einsum. I really don't -- it's still a complete mystery to me what  W_bhtt = jnp.einsum("bthr,bThr->bhtT", Q_bthr, K_bthr)  means
[13:00:15] <PapuaHardyNet> that's because the variable naming convention shows the shape
[13:00:22] <shawwwn> yes
[13:00:40] <shawwwn> the only thing I understand about that einsum is that it ends with -> bhtT
[13:00:45] <shawwwn> and the variable is named W_bhtt
[13:01:01] <shawwwn> so therefore ... uh ... it's doing ... things
[13:01:19] <shawwwn> but if I had to sit down and write out what the math ops are that it's doing, I wouldn't be able to
[13:01:38] <shawwwn> and that's dangerous, because this little einsum expression can really hide a lot of performance degredation that you wouldn't expect
[13:01:49] <PapuaHardyNet> it can?
[13:01:53] <shawwwn> mmhm.
[13:02:11] <shawwwn> as models get bigger, parallelization and sharding become crucial. But we're still living in the stone age in terms of visualization tools
[13:02:36] <shawwwn> your performance can be killed simply by sharding one way and not the other way, because the einsum multiplies that way
[13:03:22] <shawwwn> the clearest example of that is megatron, where without special considerations, a multiply like that might end up touching data on all of the cores at once, inside the innermost loop
[13:03:40] <shawwwn> so the GPT graph is basically, for i from 0 to n_blocks: block(...)
[13:03:49] <shawwwn> and each block is self-attention followed by mlp
[13:04:41] <shawwwn> so if your block ends up doing an einsum across all of the cores, you kill your performance, because you don't need to -- the cross replica traffic (the all-gather) can be deferred until the end of each lbock()

[13:06:08] <nshepperd2> transposes aren't really
[13:06:16] <shawwwn> in my experience, the simplest code is the fastest code. hands down.
[13:06:18] <nshepperd2> aren't real
[13:06:39] <shawwwn> and I agree with nshepperd. it's very hard to figure out what's "real" when xla optimizations come into play
[13:06:54] <shawwwn> james bradbury keeps reassuring me that the XLA compiler is designed to optimize specifically the case that I just described
[13:07:23] <shawwwn> if that's true, then the way to make it fast is to make the code as simple as possible, with as few constraints as possible
[13:07:38] <shawwwn> because then the compiler will be able to bring all of its magic to bear, and you don't have to do anything

[13:10:33] <shawwwn> if you compare this to megatron's codebase in detail, you'll see that megatron was handcrafted for their exact design. whereas in this case, this code is the opposite; it's crafted to take advantage of the XLA optimizer, and to let it do all the heavy lifting

[13:14:46] <shawwwn> that's what really convinced me that hand-crafting einsums and so on was hopeless in comparison

[13:15:14] <shawwwn> well, it gets even weirder.
[13:15:26] <shawwwn> I don't understand how we live in today's world. but we do live in this world:
[13:15:42] <nshepperd2> since the einsum says exactly what you want to do, while the latter the optimizer needs to figure out what you meant and fuse the ops back together
[13:15:46] <shawwwn> jax's design for xmap, is that xmap can turn axes into named tensors
[13:15:57] <shawwwn> however, their design is that named tensors *have no order*
[13:16:05] <shawwwn> if it has a name, it *does not* correspond to any integer index
[13:16:30] <shawwwn> it took a long time for me to admit to myself that maybe this isn't as crazy as it sounds
[13:17:05] <shawwwn> in other words, we're quickly traveling towards a future that looks an awful lot like "not worrying about transposing anything at all"
[13:17:21] <shawwwn> because if everything is named, then none of it has any ordering.
[13:17:43] <Gurkenglas> Can we weaken the VNM axioms in order to get a larger space than that of utility functions, in hopes of finding one where we can aggregate a distribution?
[13:18:01] <shawwwn> at that point, the XLA compiler has complete freedom to do a lot of intensive optimizations that you otherwise couldn't do -- apparently. I don't understand why, quite yet.
[13:18:48] <shawwwn> but their track record speaks for itself, so I've learned to blindly trust that their designs are the result of people many times smarter than I am working together as an effective unit.

[13:27:48] <nshepperd2> "a woman with a face" gosh
[13:27:48] <shawwwn> I wish I could put into words what the diffs are, because I find it quite neat
[13:28:12] <shawwwn> there's a definite footprint that AI imagery seems to have. Different kinds have different footprints, but they all seem to have them
[13:28:35] <shawwwn> (it'd be ironic if this was just another clip image)

[13:29:24] <shawwwn> in fact, I uh ... huh. I like https://www.hicetnunc.xyz/objkt/194744 and didn't expect to.
[13:29:31] <Gurkenglas> nshepperd2, does that number increase if we make imagining suffering a standard benchmark for all future nets?

[13:29:46] <shawwwn> reminds me of how evil my mom was
[13:29:59] <Gurkenglas> (as in, would they disapprove of making this a standard benchmark)
[13:30:12] <nshepperd2> Gurkenglas: I suspect this only seems like a sensible question to you because "sota net" is a black box which means a really smart computer or something
[13:30:43] <Gurkenglas> I thought you might say that. Do you think people with such worries have valid values but invalid beliefs?
[13:30:44] <nshepperd2> but you wouldn't say this about someone asking an illustrator for an artist's impression of a suffering electron
[13:31:08] <Gurkenglas> nshepperd2, wrong! But that damage is already done.
[13:32:24] <nshepperd2> your negative pascal's wager isn't even a feather in the scales against having a few cool pictures
[13:32:26] <Gurkenglas> the hundredth human-written tragedy isn't going to do more damage than the previous 99. But we're going into new territory here
[13:36:59] <Gurkenglas> nshepperd2, did the same intuition that tells you a pile of linear algebra can't be a moral patient also tell you that it can't pass a turing test?
[13:38:22] <nshepperd2> no
[13:39:42] <Gurkenglas> May I have your reasoning for why your network can't be morally relevant?
[13:45:14] <Gurkenglas> You're allowed to answer "cba", and I'll try involving less effort on your part.
[13:46:41] <nshepperd2> it's not imagining things
[13:46:55] <Gurkenglas> How do you know?
[13:47:03] <nshepperd2> your question is akin to asking why a piece of paper with 'the moon' written on it can't be large round and rocky

[14:14:49] <Gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet, but you chose the example to test my boundary. Where's yours?
[14:15:01] <PapuaHardyNet> no, the refutation is that robots, even if they have sociable behavior, are not actually sociable. People willingly participate in deluding themselves because it benefits them at certain times. When it isn't beneficial to consider a robot human due to their behavior, people will tend to look at it as inhuman.

[14:16:30] <PapuaHardyNet> Gurkenglas: your end goal is to convince me or nshepperd about something related to decision theory, which I'm not quite willing to read about. I apologize for that.

[14:20:37] <Gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet, that's close to one of my moral intuition pumps: Empathy is an adaptation for decision theory; in an ontological crises, what you do is you rescue the utility function by going back to causes; therefore we should choose how much we care about each entity to maximize our expected benefit from cooperation.
[14:21:12] <Gurkenglas> (And of course, that pump is not in charge of all my moral uncertainty measure.)
[14:21:24] <nshepperd2> would make a clever logo for an mtf javascript user group or something though
[14:21:28] <PapuaHardyNet> Gurkenglas: that's interesting, and I agree with you
[14:21:51] <nshepperd2> if you compressed the letters in the middle a bit
[14:22:25] <nshepperd2> ...and made it look less like it spells 'traps'
[14:22:58] <shawwwn> nshepperd2: haha.
[14:23:02] <Gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet, that intuition pump implies that if we give a gpt protocol a permanent server and it proceeds to make money and friends on the internet, we should care about it for the same reason we care about other humans
[14:23:05] <dbohdan> nshepperd2: lol
[14:26:26] <nshepperd2> gpt doesn't have any persistent internal state
[14:26:30] <PapuaHardyNet> we as in the general public? I doubt that's a good idea.
[14:26:50] <dbohdan> By the way, if you don't like looking at Imgur albums (e.g., feep's) on Imgur, you can use https://dschep.github.io/imgur-album-downloader/.  It is not just a download but a compact viewer, too.
[14:26:50] <Robomot> Imgur Album Downloader
[14:27:03] <dbohdan> *a downloader
[14:27:39] <PapuaHardyNet> I think the problem is that your definition of "care" and "we" is vague
[14:28:15] <Gurkenglas> nshepperd2, i said gpt protocol. such as a prompt that describes the setup and what it just saw, and uses its output to execute terminal commands on its server and show it the results
[14:29:18] <nshepperd2> so if it somehow managed to develop a subjective point of view by language model training, such a setup would more akin to a person repeatedly being created, forced to continue writing a story based only on the last chapter, then killed
[14:30:41] <Gurkenglas> <PapuaHardyNet> we as in the general public? I doubt that's a good idea. <- because it incentivizes more such creation? suppose that such creation is reliably outlawed before the second such server is created.
[14:32:16] <Gurkenglas> nshepperd2, could you tell that it has developed such, or would you just become smoothly more horrified as we approached the scenario
[14:33:22] <nshepperd2> dunno
[14:33:36] <nshepperd2> it probably wouldn't mind being killed though, since it wouldn't be trained to mind
[14:34:08] <Gurkenglas> No training as in parameter updates involved here, all that changes is the prompt.
[14:35:26] <Gurkenglas> <nshepperd2> dunno <- Congratulations! The uncertainty curve should move away from 0 far before it reaches 50%.

[14:40:43] <Gurkenglas> They tried to not make a prompt such that the output is panic about impending death, yes. And I agree that such an alternative setup should not be made. More so than your suffering prompt, but the difference is one of degree. And doing your prompt any finite amount of times is still less bad than the prompt setup, I think.
[14:41:31] <nshepperd2> i afraid your entire line of reasoning seems completely deformed to me
[14:42:17] <PapuaHardyNet> let's say I take a pill that gives me hallucinations and makes me panic about impending death of my current self. A few hours later, the pill wears off and I'm the way I was before. Was anything of value lost?
[14:42:17] <Gurkenglas> Weird! Is there some simple underlying mistake?
[14:43:03] <nshepperd2> i can write a story about panic about impending death without panicing about impending death
[14:43:46] <PapuaHardyNet> (do pure functions really deserve any consideration? They take inputs and produce outputs. If you can reduce GPT into a pure function, then surely there's no point in worrying about the "nonexistence" of one internal state of the pure function.)
[14:43:48] <Gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet, yeah, there's that one guy in the council of a million far-future judges that doesn't like it. But we can't please everyone, and we won't lose 100 times as much if you do it every day
[14:43:52] <nshepperd2> and indeed that is definitely what will happen if i've spent subjective millenia just writing stories
[14:45:41] <Gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet, presumably you also posit that within the hours you don't interact with anyone else?
[14:45:42] <PapuaHardyNet> (you can refute my argument by saying that if non-reproducibility is what makes a function "human", then adding randomness makes it something worth giving ethical consideration to. And I would not disagree there.)
[14:46:35] <PapuaHardyNet> Gurkenglas: I'm assuming I interact with the people I'm close to, in the best of behavior, assuming that yes, I'm going to die for sure, so I should ensure they have the best memories of me they will ever have.
[14:47:07] <PapuaHardyNet> (with this assumption, there are side effects that you would desire for your argument to have weight, so I've added it)
[14:47:47] <Gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet, it's not about randomness. Running a random human life is ~equivalent to running a pseudorandom human life, and running *all* the possible human lives involves no randomness
[14:51:26] <nshepperd2> running functions in the real world involves doing thermodynamic work
[14:52:00] <Gurkenglas> your morals should not crash and burn if it turns out the laws of physics allow a perpetuum mobile
[14:52:15] <nshepperd2> not the point
[14:53:12] <Gurkenglas> nshepperd2, 1. you write about your self-insert interacting with a fictional internet. 2. you write about your self-insert interacting with the actual internet, by executing its actions on your computer 3. you keep a diary. <- which characters are morally relevant?
[14:53:27] <nshepperd2> none of them
[14:54:15] <Gurkenglas> is there a similar question i could ask about 3 whose answer is yes?
[14:55:00] <nshepperd2> when you write about your day, it's you that experienced it, not the diary
[14:55:39] <nshepperd2> nor is it the verbal processing system which describes the events after the fact based on memories which experienced it
[14:56:53] <Gurkenglas> when you call your mom she can infer your experiences and react appropriately from 2&3 but not 1
[14:57:18] <nshepperd2> no she can't, my diary is private
[14:57:24] <PapuaHardyNet> lmao
[14:59:48] <nshepperd2> it seems like you're equating writing about a thing with the actual thing itself, which is just the most basic map-territory confusion

[15:02:40] <nshepperd2> that ought to really bake your noodle
[15:03:12] <Gurkenglas> nshepperd2, how do you know that there is the actual thing? your thoughts are also merely a map of it, right?
[15:03:45] <nshepperd2> how do you know that there's writing
[15:06:26] <Gurkenglas> rephrasing. reality is made of causes and effects, you writing thoughts down is morally equivalent to keeping them in your head, they're about something in their past but when you look there's just more atoms, so the only thing there is to attach value to is the map. right?
[15:07:02] <nshepperd2> that doesn't even make sense
[15:07:06] <kuudes> how many bits is there again in gpt-3?
[15:07:41] <kuudes> I mean, my current strong prior is that gpt-3 has << information than a human or animal brain
[15:07:57] <kuudes> and to such extent that consciousness can't fit in there
[15:08:04] <Gurkenglas> kuudes, human software may be inefficient
[15:08:28] <nshepperd2> iirc it's about 1 TiB
[15:10:32] <kuudes> Gurkenglas, I can agree a mouse can be conscious to some such extent that we should not torture it. I presume we can't fit a mouse consciousness to gpt-3
[15:11:39] <Gurkenglas> kuudes, do you agree that you can get consciousness from a short (<< 1 MB) deterministic program on a hypercomputer?
[15:11:39] <kuudes> and indeed gpt does not have a loop, so it seems very unlikely it can have anything we label consciousness
[15:11:51] <kuudes> hypercomputers don't exist
[15:12:26] <Gurkenglas> how is it everyone bakes physical assumptions into their morality
[15:12:45] <kuudes> a lookup table is not conscious even if it can contain a consciousness. it seems to me clear that in order for something to be conscious, it needs continuous computation
[15:13:16] <kuudes> Gurkenglas, just because I can imagine imaginary persons, does not mean I harm actual persons if I harm my imaginations
[15:15:48] <Gurkenglas> kuudes, would you agree with my caution if we're talking about a human-sized gpt whose outputs are used to produce its inputs?
[15:16:18] <kuudes> could be

[16:07:43] <nshepperd2> Gurkenglas: with every abstraction and ridiculous thought experiment you recede further from knowing wtf you're talking about
[16:10:16] <kuudes> given gpt-3 is 1 TB, and there are about 2*100 G cells in human brain, it is not strictly impossible a human brain size of bits would fit into gpt-3.
[16:11:20] <kuudes> that would give us some 5 bytes per cell which is not very much

[16:24:05] <Gurkenglas> Because you've seen its outputs and think that for now it'd diverge immediately, and because it hasn't happened yet? Fair enough.

[16:39:11] <PlanckWalk> (Unless the test really sucked, I guess)
[16:41:46] <PlanckWalk> Though that's pretty orthogonal to moral worth.  There are plenty of animals that don't pass a theory of mind test, that I think may deserve some moral consideration.
[16:42:13] <Gurkenglas> yeah that was more "if it passes theory of mind surely it can apply that same skill to itself to infer its past mental states"

[18:01:28] <RiversHaveWings> nshepperd2: :)
[18:01:37] <RiversHaveWings> I am considering fine-tuning it into an unconditional model
[18:02:12] <RiversHaveWings> OpenAI tries to discourage fine-tuning in their model card, but given what they said literally in the next paragraph about CLIP guidance and how well that actually works in practice, I would not trust them
[18:02:35] <RiversHaveWings> "To probe fine-tuning capabilities, we restricted our compute budget to roughly $100 and tried both standard fine-tuning, and a diffusion-specific approach where we train a specialized classifier for the LSUN class. The resulting FIDs were significantly worse than publicly available GAN models, indicating that fine-tuning an ImageNet diffusion model does not significantly lower the cost of image generation."
[18:02:55] <RiversHaveWings> What they are saying is it's harder to fine-tune than a StyleGAN.
[18:03:00] <RiversHaveWings> And if you put in the amount of compute you would need to half-ass fine-tuning a StyleGAN, you get worse results than just fine-tuning the StyleGAN
[18:03:05] <RiversHaveWings> Therefore the model is OK to release
[18:03:23] <RiversHaveWings> Never mind that if you put in *more* compute you can probably get far superior results to a StyleGAN. This possibility is entirely unmentioned.
[18:03:30] <RiversHaveWings> These are not actual reasons, they are justifications for why they get to do the thing they wanted to do, which is release it
[18:04:10] <RiversHaveWings> Anyway I just want to fine-tune it from class-conditional ImageNet to unconditional ImageNet and this is easier than the thing they tried.
[18:04:15] <nshepperd2> it should be possible to fine-tune without destroying much of the quality by some sort of self-distillation, right?
[18:04:35] <RiversHaveWings> i don't know
[18:05:18] <nshepperd2> like (frozen_model(class, image) - model(image))^2 should have much lower variance
[18:05:24] <RiversHaveWings> the only thing i have actually tried when fine-tuning was to augment the original training set w/ the data to fine-tune on (where the data to fine-tune on was duplicated a bunch when sampling bc there was less of it)
[18:05:37] <RiversHaveWings> also this was just with a stylegan
[18:05:53] <PapuaHardyNet> RiversHaveWings: no, nothing like that
[18:06:21] <PapuaHardyNet> also I've hit swap space saturation, 8GB of swap is full and thrashing as the training occurs, very enjoyable to watch
[18:06:25] <RiversHaveWings> nshepperd2: idk if that's actually the case
[18:06:54] <RiversHaveWings> w/ a class-conditional model then the class label determines what class you get for *fixed noise*
[18:07:20] <RiversHaveWings> w/ the unconditional model it has to produce the same output for the same noise
[18:07:36] <RiversHaveWings> and the random seed determines what class you end up with

[18:34:41] * two2thehead clicks
[18:34:55] <vrs> if you wanna binge something, try their architecture explainer talks
[18:35:25] <two2thehead> ah, a general CPU vs an ASIC. Gotcha. vrs +1
[18:35:35] <dbohdan> nshepperd2: It looks like a slightly cropped scan of one made with a '90s scanner
[18:36:09] <dbohdan> Like, whoever scanned it cut off at least half an inch on every side
[18:36:43] <feep> vrs: yeah ... gimme
[18:37:03] <feep> two2thehead: no the mill is still a general cpu
[18:37:15] <feep> it's just a general cpu that works in a really weird way compared to established cpu

[18:39:36] <feep> two2thehead: this one wiki on belt architectures is that they have a cool thing where
[18:39:46] <feep> like, with an x86 cpu, you know how eax isn't actually eax
[18:40:03] <feep> it's just some random register that's been declared to "be eax" for this operand, because it was free when the operation started
[18:40:09] * nshepperd2 tries even more obscure emoji
[18:40:49] <feep> two2thehead: the mill architecture makes that explicit by just never assigning any register any name, and instead working in a ringbuffer
[18:41:15] <feep> every write op just writes to the next register in the file
[18:41:27] <feep> and you reference registers by "the result of two instructions back" or such
[18:41:59] <feep> and the idea is, because processors internally work like that *anyway*, this should simplify the design
[18:42:13] <feep> as I understand it anyway
[18:42:45] <feep> also the target register is implicit, which saves instruction set space
[18:43:42] <two2thehead> i'm reading, but I'm also watching the lecture
[18:43:50] <two2thehead> so if I don't reply/am slow to reply, that's why
[18:44:02] <nshepperd2> they said that you basically save a whole lot of electricity by not needing to do indirect addressing on registers on every single instruction iirc
[18:44:57] <vrs> there's also a lot of stuff that cleverly avoids branching, so there's much less of that
[18:48:14] * two2thehead saves the above in onenote for future reference
[18:48:19] <two2thehead> vrs, feep nshepperd2 +1
[18:49:09] <feep> two2thehead: save https://handwiki.org/wiki/Mill_architecture instead, that's what I was going off

[18:49:37] <two2thehead> alright
[18:49:51] * dbohdan realizes "squid314.livejournal.com" was supposed to read "squid pie"
[18:49:51] <dbohdan> Oh
[18:49:53] <Robomot> Jackdaws love my big sphinx of quartz ‚Äî LiveJournal (...and other observations)
[18:51:34] <feep> dbohdan: alright! hash.get("foo", defaultValue) now works~
[18:51:50] <feep> I think with that I can start actually using hashmaps in the compiler
[18:52:26] <dbohdan> feep: Great!  Are you going to have a standard option type?
[18:52:52] <feep> dbohdan: not really planning to atm
[18:53:01] <feep> dbohdan: rn I'm not sure I see the advantage over (T | :none)
[18:53:05] <feep> er
[18:53:10] <feep> (T | fail :none)
[18:53:44] <feep> or rather, that's already p much option
[18:54:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern, quanticle: https://imgur.com/gallery/B0uohLJ
[18:54:02] <feep> dbohdan: for instance, hashmaps are literally just defined as an array of (Value | :empty | :gravestone)
[18:54:03] <Robomot> Come and get some, fellas. - Imgur
[18:54:14] <feep> which seems convenient
[18:54:43] <feep> or rather, convenient enough that I don't really need to add an alias Maybe(T) = (T | fail :none);
[18:54:58] <feep> dbohdan: I think with the pick operator, that's powerful enough
[18:55:46] <dbohdan> feep: There will be advantages if you implement HKT, I guess
[18:57:19] <feep> HKT?
[18:57:20] <dbohdan> I don't know enough about types to immediately think of other major consequences
[18:57:29] <dbohdan> Higher-kinded types
[18:57:37] <feep> oh I guess
[18:57:46] <feep> I kinda like the concept of just duck typing that
[18:57:55] <feep> like, a Maybe is something that responds to auto a <- value
[18:58:17] <feep> so just try to do the op and see what happens

[19:25:45] <dbohdan> feep: "Spike"
[19:25:51] <feep> oyeah, hashmaps are a spike demo rn
[19:25:55] <feep> thanks
[19:26:01] <dbohdan> YW
[19:26:26] <dbohdan> I should add "spike" to my "conceptual toolbox" page
[19:27:38] <dbohdan> (Not yet published.  I am not sure what to do with it, because a good version of it would include some of Moldbug's lingo.)
[19:29:43] <dbohdan> (Then again, I already have a page about my email to Nick Land.)
[19:33:16] <Gurkenglas> dbohdan, give everyone with the same ip and everyone who visits on the same day the same random subset of entries in order to make it hard to verify that his lingo isn't on there, then don't put it on there :3
[19:34:10] <gwern> 'spike' sounds like a bad term to me compared to something less overloaded and clearer like 'testcase' or 'prototype'
[19:35:04] <dbohdan> Gurkenglas: lol
[19:35:15] <dbohdan> gwern: "Vertical prototype"?
[19:35:18] <Gurkenglas> perhaps one could also do the other side, sending a set of strings ruled out along with every set of strings ruled in, and never rule out moldbug's lingo
[19:35:25] <dbohdan> Or is that redundant?
[19:35:55] <gwern> dbohdan: still very confusing
[19:36:19] <feep> got it, lack of unsigned types bit me
[19:36:30] <feep> negative hashes are not good for your hashmap :P
[19:37:41] <feep> man, there is ... there is a worrying amount of // TODO in this fibonacci demo.
[19:38:27] <nshepperd> what's wrong with negative hashes
[19:38:36] <gwern> indices, I assume, and wraparound would be confusing
[19:38:41] <Gurkenglas> but one would need to start with some set of strings that includes moldbug's lingo, large enough to make it not your fault it's in the set, but if it's large enough, won't the amount of time needed to rule out the complete gibberish also be almost the amount of time needed to verify that moldbug is never ruled out?
[19:38:56] <feep> yeah exactly, I just ended up with negative hashtable accesses which was a bit bad :p
[19:40:18] <nshepperd> wouldn't you just modulus it
[19:40:30] <feep> yeah but with the C semantics, modulus of a negative number is negative
[19:40:37] <feep> I should probably avoid that
[19:40:42] <nshepperd> shameful
[19:41:38] <nshepperd> more evidence that C semantics is a curse from an evil witch
[19:46:31] <Gurkenglas> surely there is a compiler flag that makes your program print a warning if you ever take the modulus of a negative number, among other pitfalls
[19:47:06] <nshepperd> "surely the world can't be that cruel, can it?"
[19:51:27] <feep> oh lol this is a fun bug
[19:51:31] <feep> hash[i] = fib_(i - 1) + fib_(i - 2);
[19:51:38] <feep> what exactly happens there is
[19:51:44] <feep> fib_(i - 1) inserts a new value into hash
[19:51:52] <feep> this causes it to reallocate, changing the address in hash
[19:52:08] <feep> but the []= operation has already stored the address in preparation for the assignment
[19:52:22] <feep> this is the sort of shit compilers make you deal with :V

Appealing art style, layers upon layers, better paced progression than any other, no combat/etc, and works the theme for purpose‚Äô
[20:53:39] <feep> mst: I've been meaning to look at that
[20:53:45] <feep> after this game of factorio with ralith maybe~
[20:54:21] <feep> so in a month maybe XD
[20:54:35] <feep> might be more, depending on how those last few megatiers of research go
[20:56:05] <ggreer> I doubt that lee edwards story very much
[20:56:35] <ggreer> literally nobody in that restaurant had the balls to stop that guy? that sounds insane to me
[20:58:29] <rsaarelm> I still haven't done the whole disappearing into a Factorio hole thing.
[20:58:39] <feep> have you finished the basegame?
[20:58:47] <feep> it's pretty good now
[20:58:58] <rsaarelm> No, I've never gotten up to plastics making.
[20:59:16] <ggreer> like... I've had someone throw a drink at me and that starts a fight. it definitely doesn't end with "call police and let the asshole escape"
[20:59:17] <rsaarelm> I'd need to start going down the hole to get things efficient enough for that.
[21:00:37] <feep> uu?
[21:00:58] <feep> rsaarelm: it's really just a matter of scaling
[21:01:18] <rsaarelm> Optimizing things and figuring out base builds and getting into base build optimization obsession and so on.
[21:01:30] <feep> I think most people beginning at the game underestimate how far they can scale their production
[21:01:32] <mst> ggreer: I can see somebody throwing -one- drink in my local and that resulting in them getting barred rather than knocked out
[21:01:44] <mst> but that's mostly because we'd rather not go to the hassle
[21:01:52] <rsaarelm> Like, basically, I think there's two modes for me, no Factorio and obsessive Factorio bender.
[21:01:57] <feep> ah that's fair~
[21:01:59] <mst> after like the third thrown drink the regulars would absolutely restrain the idiot
[21:02:31] <rsaarelm> And I need to go through one bender to get the game in my brain.
[21:02:54] <rsaarelm> Could probably play casually after that once I have better idea of the patterns.
[21:03:47] <feep> right right~
[21:03:50] <feep> that makes sense
[21:03:53] <feep> it's definitely very bendable

[23:47:36] <shawwwn> slander? Hmm
[23:47:40] <shawwwn> I see no slander
[23:47:55] <shawwwn> I see a prophecy
[23:48:09] <gwern> we should all aspire to aspirate like him
[23:48:11] <shawwwn> Make no mistake, feepbot isn‚Äôt your friend. You‚Äôll see
[23:48:52] <gwern> ie. clear, concise, cunctative
[23:49:13] <shawwwn> On the other hand, now that I have dbotdan‚Äôs source code, I can make a <totallygwern> bot
[23:49:19] <shawwwn> And do all my talking through that
[23:49:51] <namespace> notes
[23:50:02] <shawwwn> Don‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôll be called shawnbot, so there won‚Äôt be any confusion I‚Äôm sure
[23:50:25] <gwern> that sounds like it'd make tab-complete annoying
[23:50:53] <shawwwn> Oh you‚Äôre right. I‚Äôll name it gwenbot
[23:51:05] <Gurkenglas> would it help or hurt to cause a public panic about mirror life? might make banana republics make a capsule to get a seat at the nukie table
[23:51:26] <two2thehead> gwen sounds like gwent which is a name of a card game, it'll be confusing
[23:51:50] <gwern> Gurkenglas: mirror life research is so niche and so practically useless atm that self-regulation would be a lot better than any blunt-force trauma appeal to the public
[23:51:52] <shawwwn> The world: *goes on* ‚Ä¶ Gurkenglas: ‚Äúwe must deal with mirror life‚Äù
[23:55:29] <feep> two2thehead: honestly, when feepbot says <gwern> you should believe it's actually <gwern>
[23:55:43] <feep> feepbot is a moral bot, it doesn't lie
[23:55:45] <two2thehead> :thinking_face:
[23:55:58] <gwern> feep: you're tempting fate with that
