[03:41:04] <ayenet4> trying to imagine what something called libsigc++ does that makes porting a non-trivial task
[03:41:20] <vdamewood> It's not libsigc++, it's autotools that's the problem.
[03:41:58] <ayenet4> autotools doesn't target ios?
[03:42:00] <vdamewood> Well, Apple is probably about 10% of the problem too.
[03:42:18] <vdamewood> ayenet4: Technically, Autotools only targets POSIX.
[03:43:40] <vdamewood> The part where Apple is to blame is the fact that they make the iOS toolchain somewhat hard to find on your system.
[03:44:08] <vdamewood> For example, the iOS version of clang is at /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/clang
[03:44:43] <vdamewood> Actually... does that one specifically target iOS? It might support all platforms.
[03:45:59] <vdamewood> ayenet4: Anyway, autotools isn't aware of any particular operating system, it just runs its configure script in a Bourne-compatible shell, does its checks, and spits out a Makefile and some config files (maybe) based on input templates. You have to pass specific parameters to cross compile with it.

[05:00:08] <jeaye> The easiest way is to just allow the leading 0.

[06:09:18] <pikapika> I mean people code entire apps in pl/sql so its not unnatural to consider awk
[06:09:40] <arahael> There are reasons for pl/sql, though.

[06:16:11] <arahael> pikapika: Many things "might" be the case.  I'm saying that if they were to do it in SQL, they would have had actual reasons for picking it.

[12:26:32] <mrig> Intelo: I can tell the difference between useful intelligence and dangerous intelligence, why cant you?
[12:26:35] <Joanna> Of course but programming doesn’t require physical strength so anyone can do it who is mentally capable
[12:26:38] <xerxes> women have either equal or better pain tolerance than men.
[12:26:47] <arahael> Intelo: None of those apply to the software field, and infact, wasn't the field predominantly female in the past?
[12:27:01] <Lyn> hm, I can see your point xerxes. I personally would be skeptical of the deduction, but otoh I haven't observed any examples to see if that's the case
[12:27:01] <arahael> Somehow, we've made the field hostile.
[12:27:02] <|7|> Intelo: for me (good women programmers I know) / (total women programmers I know) >> (mutch higher) as (god men programmers I know) / (total men programmers I know)
[12:27:16] * Intelo wonders why he found most women dumb
[12:27:19] <xerxes> Lyn: that kind of deduction applies to other criteria too.

[12:30:53] <xerxes> vdamewood: you shouldn't have quieted him.
[12:31:22] <Lyn> agreed
[12:31:22] <Joanna> The whole discussion seems to be about why he things women are inferior. We don’t even know if his story is even true
[12:31:43] <vdamewood> xerxes: It was for sexism, not any perception of trolling.
[12:31:48] <xerxes> vdamewood: it was me who suggested hiring women, he was just putting forth his biased opinion.
[12:32:02] <Lyn> he is speaking his own observations in his own environment. I know it's easy to become enraged but imo should pay attention to what he is actually saying, and not quiet on what you think he is saying

[12:34:19] <Joanna> I don’t like this pitting the genders against eachother nonsense it doesn’t belong here this channel is about programming is it not “
[12:34:53] <W> his observations of his own environment were sexist. Whether the environment he lives in is generally sexist, more or less than the environment me or any of the other ops live in, is irrelevant. This channel is its _own_ environment, that we have great influence on.
[12:35:13] <xerxes> W: i don't think his intentions were to spread sexism.

[12:49:59] <W> the cost of training is the length of training proportional to the length of employment, independent of working hours or number of employees, surely?
[12:50:00] <vdamewood> I can really only see one good reason to require people to work on Saturday, and that's because, culturally, Saturday isn't a weekend day. Such as in Iran where the weekend is Thursday and Friday.
[12:50:02] <|7|> not every job/task can be split to more people easy

[13:12:09] <Izem> yeah
[13:12:16] <Guest73> Ok great
[13:12:25] <Guest73> Just need a amazon or craigslist, web2.0 stlye site
[13:12:27] <Izem> idk about secure, what do you mean by that?
[13:12:32] <Izem> has gc
[13:12:44] <Guest73> secure like, like, doesnt come with 50 Remote code exploits baked in like Windows XP does
[13:12:54] <Izem> yeah, it's alright
[13:13:00] <Izem> better than node
[13:13:59] <Izem> but you sound like you want a frontend framework?
[13:14:29] <Izem> mrig: no need to go so far back, db cooper was last seen in the 70s
[13:14:54] <Guest73> I need full stack, no javascript
[13:15:12] <Guest73> Login Form, cookies to track logins, database with hashed + salted user passwords etc
[13:15:16] <Guest73> then hosting small iamges
[13:15:18] <Guest73> images

[13:16:35] <Guest73> Whats the easiest way to code the site I described?
[13:16:40] <Guest73> Front page is login form, registaration form
[13:16:47] <Guest73> Second page is the main website with images and text
[13:16:58] <Guest73> so I need login page, database with user accounts, and cookie handling
[13:17:03] <Guest73> whats the easiest way to handle all of this
[13:17:06] <Izem> that's fine, it's the db I don't know anything about
[13:17:08] <Guest73> I feel like, given the billions of websites
[13:17:14] <Guest73> there should be some easy way to set it up
[13:17:28] <ayenet4> but you want it to be secure
[13:17:40] <Guest73> yes
[13:17:43] <arahael> Guest73: You want a web framework.  Go itself is a poor choice (on it's own).  But if you want to use Go, then perhaps using Gorilla is probably sensible - I haven't personally used it however.
[13:18:02] <Guest73> Whats the best  web framework I can use then? no Javascript
[13:18:09] <Guest73> I dont need responsive type sites

[13:19:28] <Guest73> What about Perl
[13:19:33] <Guest73> Perm compared to Ruby?

[13:20:17] <Guest73> arahael, what do you reccomend here?
[13:21:08] <arahael> Guest73: At this stage, literally any web framework.  Learn it. You probably want the somewhat more minimal ones, though.
[13:21:29] <Guest73> Yeah but most all of them use heavy javascript
[13:21:35] <Guest73> I want basic, HTML5, SQL database, etc
[13:21:40] <Izem> python might have something

[13:24:32] <ayenet4> too lazy to write assembler i see
[13:24:43] <Guest73> I consider web 2.0 like 2004 era websites
[13:24:53] <Izem> I really want to do assembly
[13:24:54] <Guest73> and modern websites are like web 3.0 "Responsive" websites
[13:25:06] <Izem> but I only end up reading it :/
[13:25:13] <Guest73> web 1.0 is like 1990 website, web 2.0 is like 2004 era, web 3.0 is like modern responsive sites
[13:25:15] <Guest73> imo
[13:25:27] <Guest73> web 1.0 is like 1 static page with .gif graphics
[13:25:34] <arahael> Well, if you want to write one from "scratch", Go is a fine choice, though I find Go's built-in template systems are limited.
[13:25:35] <Izem> you don't need js for responsive stuff?

[13:46:24] *** jazzy2 is now known as jazzy
[13:47:15] <pyzozord> From what I understand the utf-8 philosophy is simply "first of all, you don't know what a character is so don't count them. If you must count them, ask your text rendering engine, it will know"
[13:47:20] <deniska> pyzozord: one hour spent inside this library source code https://www.freetype.org/ is equivalent to 7 years on Earth
[13:48:16] <pyzozord> but here is my problem: I cannot ask the terminal how wide my characters are, can I?
[13:48:28] <Guest73> W I D E?
[13:48:34] <Guest73> Change terminal font settings
[13:48:46] <pyzozord> so how do I make utf8 tty-based roguelike?
[13:48:55] <pyzozord> if I don't know how wide are my characters?
[13:49:11] <deniska> pyzozord: if you don't use super weird characters, assume they to be 1 character long
[13:49:24] <deniska> pyzozord: terminal tries to render stuff in monospace anyway
[13:49:45] <deniska> pyzozord: also most roguelikes use a graphical window instead of tty, consider doing that :)
[13:50:37] <pyzozord> deniska: I do consider that, but it's going to stay tty for now, part of this is me diving deeper into ttys in case I want to later write other TUI programs like my own tty editor

[13:52:33] <pyzozord> that would work, only problem is I need to precalculate all characters because I can't just render random stuff in the middle of a frame
[13:52:34] <miseri> I made a javascript RTS game. You control all units by writing real code: https://yare.io (if anyone has time to try it out, would be grateful for any feedback!)

[14:38:23] <pyzozord> from what I read, getting the lengh of characters is pointless anyway because it's really very complex. The only thing that we should care about is how much memory it takes, and that strlen returns truthfully
[14:38:47] <vdamewood> pyzozord: Well, it depends on what you mean by 'support'. You're not manipulating the value there, just pumping it to stdout.
[14:39:15] <vdamewood> So, it's just a bunch of bytes being sent out, and it's up to your terminal to display the actual characters.
[14:39:38] <pyzozord> vdamewood: yeah that's a very good question. I don't really know what does it mean to 'support' utf-8 beyond pumping out utf-8 encoded strings to stdout
[14:39:40] <vdamewood> pyzozord: Well, no, because getting the number of characters tells you how many characters there are.
[14:40:10] <vdamewood> Which is useful when you, well, want the count of characters ratherthan the side of the buffer.
[14:40:16] <pyzozord> vdamewood: point was that with ligature heavy languages it might be hard to decide what is a character really
[14:40:33] <GeDaMo> The concept of 'character' is more complex with Unicode
[14:40:41] <deniska> pyzozord: until you care about making sense of what's inside the string, you can just treat utf-8 as binary blobs
[14:41:39] <GeDaMo> One of the major advantages of UTF-8 over UTF-16 or UTF-32 is that the only zero byte you will encounter is an actual ASCII 0

[19:50:32] <pyzozord> oh damn
[19:50:50] <pyzozord> that's a great idea with unrolling linked lists

[20:08:20] <alycidyne> pyzozord: If you ever do quantum mechanics, you'll reach a point where you realize that operators don't exist to measure attributes of electrons - electrons exist to let operators have something to measure, instead
[20:08:42] <alycidyne> ergo, no "thing" exists - only coincidental and entangled perceptions

[20:10:09] <archie> I have a server with two disks, each one with one partition, let's say root and data. There's a process running which writes on data partition, and may fill up the disk space
[20:10:28] <pyzozord> *learn
[20:10:59] <archie> should I put the spacer file on data partition, both, or doesn't really matter since there are two disks and root will still have free space?
[20:11:04] <alycidyne> pyzozord: it comes directly from the matrix representation of operators (spoiler alert: I did physics before switching to and majoring in CS). Eigenvectors and eigenvalues depend on the matrix, so it follows that electrons depend on the operator chosen
[20:11:33] <mrig> neither the tree, the Forest nor the gravity with which a tree might might fall over, can exist without first there being sound; I thought that old chestnut was solved? That and also weather, which is more likely the cause of the falling over; Now weather is clearly sound.
[20:12:56] <alycidyne> pyzozord: this also explains one of Einstein's objections that stars don't "disappear" if they pass behind another star

[21:54:06] <pyzozord> oh that's fun we have people who write their own database, web server, os and I have my own editor
[21:54:13] <alycidyne> Now, I remember reading somewhere that Linux in the a.out era had a sort of database which associated shared libraries with the addresses at which they were linked
[21:54:54] <alycidyne> because there was no PIC and no relocation
[21:57:20] <alycidyne> Of course, with the executable-library merger, the directory-symbol table merger and the compiler-interpreter merger, this could make a package management system redundant

[22:47:17] <blahboybaz> When a js constructor returns a valid value is that value come back as "object" or as the class name?  I can see that running typeof on an instance prodeuces "object" as the output but I don't know if I can rely on tyeof to answer my question. I want to test the return value of a class in my codebase (jest) but I'm unsure what value to test for.
[22:47:37] <alycidyne> GeDaMo: well it would make it harder to market to anyone that doesn't use the language :/
[22:48:26] <pyzozord> alycidyne: base it one some bytecode so that people can use any language they want (if they write a compiler)

[22:57:49] <pyzozord> the only ther case I can imagine is an environment where the os executable loader is also a compiler
[22:57:49] <alycidyne> pyzozord: well JS is just that: the standard doesn't specify a VM, but node's V8 is a JIT compiler for it
[22:59:10] <alycidyne> I believe PyPy also leaves out the Python virtual machine entirely

[23:01:14] <alycidyne> pyzozord: a virtual machine is... just that, a machine typically implemented in software rather than hardware
[23:01:19] <pyzozord> what is a difference between java's virtual machine and javascript's "engine"?
[23:01:49] <nitrix> One is for Java, one is for JavaScript.
[23:02:34] <alycidyne> pyzozord: the detail is that most people say "VM" for either a) a virtual machine which has the same ISA as the underlying hardware or b) a machine whose ISA was not intended to correspond to any hardware
[23:03:01] <alycidyne> pyzozord: Java's VM falls into the latter category.

[23:04:00] <pyzozord> nitrix: java's vm _has_ a jit
[23:04:35] <nitrix> Otherwise it's AOT, translating the VM bytecode to native instructions?
[23:04:43] <alycidyne> More precisely, it is _implemented_ with a JIT
[23:04:45] <Izem> alycidyne: that's so abstract
[23:05:10] <alycidyne> Izem: well, in the latter case, the intent *is* abstraction
[23:05:39] <Izem> I mean to the compiler being the os interface
[23:05:42] <nitrix> It can't /have/ a JIT or /with/ a JIT, JIT is the strategy chosen for the translation.
[23:05:49] <pyzozord> I'm so caught off guard at the fact that v8 is not a vm
[23:05:52] <Izem> s/os/disk/
[23:06:04] <Izem> v8 is not a vm?
[23:06:17] <alycidyne> Uh no
[23:06:22] <nitrix> pyzozord, What would be the instruction set for the V8 engine? JavaScript programs aren't compiled.
[23:06:39] <alycidyne> nitrix: they are interpreted or _JIT_ compiled
[23:06:44] <nitrix> pyzozord, Java programs are compiled to a bytecode instruction set that the Java VM knows.
[23:06:48] <Izem> v8 has bytecode
[23:06:54] <nitrix> Does it?
[23:06:56] <pyzozord> nitrix: aka "interpreted"
[23:06:58] <Izem> yeah
[23:07:11] <pyzozord> you must be a vm to interpret code, right?
[23:07:17] <Izem> yeah
[23:07:32] <nitrix> So then V8 is translates JavaScript programs into that bytecode and JIT it after?

[23:14:17] <alycidyne> pyzozord: you reminded me that I wanted a JIT when I said I did not want a VM. That to me suggested you thought a VM was necessary for a JIT.
[23:15:01] <pyzozord> alycidyne: oh no, I didn't think that but also I never seen any use of JIT without one
[23:15:18] <pyzozord> but I can see how a compiler is tightly copuled with the executing program
[23:15:28] <pyzozord> and compiler compiles each function as it is called
[23:15:38] <pyzozord> all done without any interpretation (thuse any vm)
[23:15:54] <pyzozord> although, like I said, I never seen or heard about a thing like that
[23:16:06] <pyzozord> but definitely would be an interesting feature of an os
[23:16:46] <pyzozord> my suggestion for bytcode was only to have some intermediate representation so that different sytnaxes can be used, because you were worried about marketability of an os tightly copuled to a single language
[23:17:18] <alycidyne> pyzozord: in that respect, I think LLVM does a rather nice job
[23:17:56] *** Quits: insolentworm (~root@vps-7db3bef3.vps.ovh.ca) (Client Quit)
[23:18:07] <pyzozord> yeah, llvm sounds like a good candidate for PID 1 :D
[23:18:20] *** Joins: insolentworm (~root@vps-7db3bef3.vps.ovh.ca)
[23:18:29] <alycidyne> and GeDaMo did mention Oberon using an AST as an intermediate form
[23:18:30] <pyzozord> well not pid 1, I guess executable loader is part of os and doesn't need to be pid 1
[23:19:23] <alycidyne> pyzozord: well executable loading is I/O (loading from disk to RAM) followed by linking (finding _start); only the former needs to be done in the OS
[23:19:45] <pyzozord> yup yup
[23:20:14] <pyzozord> the ast as intermediate form is very interesting, there is lost contex when translating from source code to bytecode
[23:20:39] <pyzozord> ast would preserve the full intent and context, which could allow for smarter linking, jitting, maybe?
[23:20:56] <pyzozord> not sure, now I'm out of my stuff
[23:21:03] <alycidyne> pyzozord: of course, nobody will be interested unless it becomes a distribution format like EXE

[23:21:40] <alycidyne> I mean, the only reason to have a VM is because people want to ship only one binary image - not source code - for all platforms - not just one
[23:22:33] <pyzozord> no, I think there must be more reasons
[23:22:41] <alycidyne> Source code (at least in a good language) is naturally platform-agnostic, but since no one wants to compile to install software, we are dragged to the least common denominator by shipping binary code

[23:23:43] <pyzozord> that's very interesting line of thought
[23:24:04] <pyzozord> why do we even compile stuff aot
[23:24:14] <GeDaMo> That's partly because traditional compilation is slow
[23:24:41] *** Joins: misnor (~misnor@156.57.153.38)
[23:24:54] <pyzozord> ah so partially it's historical reasons
[23:25:14] <pyzozord> which is a lot how technology seems to be shaped - like a tree if you cut it you see rings
[23:25:22] <GeDaMo> Some languages / projects can still be slow to compile
[23:25:38] <mercenary> why do we write programs aot, when we could just write the code we need the moment we need it?
[23:25:48] <alycidyne> GeDaMo: yes, and that would be an acceptable cost if open-source software did not need recompilation because of bug fixes...
[23:26:25] <alycidyne> mercenary: because we end up doing the same things over and over again, so it's better to save that code?
[23:26:27] <pyzozord> mercenary: yeah that's what GeDaMo said essentially, you are just repeating :P
[23:26:41] <Izem> v8 just had a great article on how they made a fast compiler: sparkplug
[23:27:04] <mercenary> pyzozord: reductio ad absurdum. compilation cost time, cycles, and power
[23:27:45] <pyzozord> mercenary: yeah
[23:28:27] <pyzozord> but I meant JIT as in "compile everything when the program is starting" not necessarily "compile functions as they are called"

[23:28:54] <GeDaMo> I suppose that would be called Load time compilation
[23:28:57] <pyzozord> I said "why do we even compile at" what I mean was "why don't we just JIT" - JIT in the sense I just mentioned

[23:36:11] <GeDaMo> Well, you need a set of primitive operations
[23:37:06] <mercenary> Executing bytecode is fast. Basically a jump table.
[23:37:35] <pyzozord> mercenary: executing bytecode as in "interpretation"?
[23:37:43] <GeDaMo> I think that bytecode (or other intermediate form) operations should be higher level
[23:37:59] <GeDaMo> In order to reduce interpretation overhead
[23:38:49] <pyzozord> wouldn't more complex constructs require more interpretation overhead?

[23:39:50] <GeDaMo> As opposed to multiple bytecode instructions to check each character

[23:42:15] <GeDaMo> Take a simple loop like: for (i in N): a[i] = b[i] + c[i]
[23:42:15] <pyzozord> each machine knows it's strong and weak points so could make different tradeoffs in how they implement a hashmap
[23:42:51] <GeDaMo> That might be 5 bytecode operations: the array access, one arithmetic operation, one loop instruction
[23:42:58] <GeDaMo> Er, three array accesses
[23:43:08] <pyzozord> eayh those kinds of apl functions too certainly
[23:43:22] <GeDaMo> If the arrays have a million elements, that 5 million instruction dispatches
[23:43:25] <pyzozord> many idoms could be converted to such operations

[23:44:20] <Izem> but it makes me wonder if there's a model that is not tied to the underlying representation
[23:44:21] <GeDaMo> Er, interpreter overhead
[23:44:28] <pyzozord> yeah, it would be much easier to vectorize those for example

[23:45:25] <Izem> interesting
[23:45:31] <pyzozord> yeah having higher level intermediate representation seems very useful. Context is very useful for deciding on what to compile
[23:45:40] <Izem> would be worth the investment for arrays alone
[23:45:44] <pyzozord> this seems pretty obvious
