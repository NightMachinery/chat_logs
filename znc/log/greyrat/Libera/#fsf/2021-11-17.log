[01:24:21] <lispmacs[work]> Hi, I'm trying to install Q4os 
[01:24:34] <lispmacs[work]> on a refurbed chromebook
[01:24:35] <zleap> ok
[01:24:42] <lispmacs[work]> (hit the enter key by accident)
[01:24:59] <zleap> hmm
[01:25:10] <lispmacs[work]> all the instructions I'm finding are how to use Crouton to install "linux" side by side with chromeos
[01:25:23] <lispmacs[work]> which is not what I had in mind
[01:25:37] <TheOwlLady> just so that we understand are do you mean Q4OS the Debian based os?
[01:25:41] <TheOwlLady> or Qubes 4.0
[01:25:47] <zleap> i have heard of crouton
[01:25:54] <lispmacs[work]> the Debian based OS
[01:26:03] <zleap> ah
[01:26:27] <zleap> i tried to install Raspberry Pi os ona  netbokk earlier, it failed as it was unable to find the firware stuff
[01:26:29] <lispmacs[work]> I was assuming that I could just enter BIOS like every other computer and then boot from USB but am not finding any instructions on how to do that
[01:26:29] <zleap> firmware
[01:26:47] <zleap> however it installed fine when I did it on another netbook (same model)
[01:27:04] <TheOwlLady> lispmacs[work]: I believe Chromebooks are locked by deault from just easily installing a different OS

[01:27:09] <TheOwlLady> I do not own one though
[01:27:11] <zleap> given it wants these drives on a seperate disk it assumes the person installing knows what to do
[01:27:22] <zleap> i have no idea where to even download them

[01:32:29] <lispmacs[work]> I'm find more pages about the bios
[01:33:32] <lispmacs[work]> a "write protect screw"!? goodness gracious
[01:33:33] <TheOwlLady> I wish you the best of luck, especially if you are receiving firmware errors. Crouton only supports UBuntu and Debian. I would recommend testing one of those OSes first, just to verify it works.
[01:34:37] <TheOwlLady> Oh wait, look here: https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton/issues/4026
[01:35:21] <TheOwlLady> that might help, I guess Crouton updated their installation steps a bit
[01:36:22] <lispmacs[work]> looks like I've got to take the chromebook apart, remove a write-protect screw, log back into chromeos, flash a new bios...

[06:07:31] <kittyblam> there *does* need to be more community focus tho, the ideal situation right now would be if resources could be gathered for making a hard fork of a BSD and more development for Hurd, while putting both if possible under a GPL-like social domain license.
[06:07:55] <DiffieHellman> I don't see how code under a nonfree license will help.
[06:09:22] <kittyblam> It would prevent malicious manipulation by the likes of amazon and microsoft and the such, while still allowing it to be free for everyone.
[06:10:43] <kittyblam> It would prevent whats happening to linux right now, and allow real community driven free designs to flourish imo, it would *not* prevent other corporations or groups from benefiting it, it could trivially be worded to only prevent the worst of the worst.
[06:11:03] <coyotes4ys> "not everyone has the skills/will" well that's why i said "(and could be de facto hired by people who can't/don't wanna to do major distros for them)"
[06:11:48] <kittyblam> In practice, abandoning large corporations should allow things to be easier for individuals and small teams to modify, without nearly so much intentional malicious overcomplexity.
[06:12:22] <kittyblam> In other words, it would defacto protect peoples freedom to modify and distribute software more. While not in law, in practice nobody is hard forking linux.

[06:13:06] <kittyblam> By taking a community approach, and making a GPL-like social domain license, it should *protect* that ability for small teams to work on these things and have a greater understanding of it
[06:13:19] <kittyblam> In *practice* it should be more free
[06:13:56] <DiffieHellman> You don't have to use code from corporations at all, you can just not use it.
[06:14:48] <kittyblam> In practice right now that would be a hard task without actual preventions, because these types of licenses are not yet common place
[06:15:49] <DiffieHellman> You cannot prevent the actions of corporations with copyright, so such types of licenses are pointless to write.
[06:18:36] <kittyblam> You can, you don't see microsoft forking every single GPL'd application under their proprietary license, although those types of groups *do* maliciously contribute, and make such issues as the WSL, and amazon does try circumnavigating them
[06:18:48] <kittyblam> but these protections do work on what they specificy
[06:19:16] <coyotes4ys> "In practice, abandoning large corporations should allow things to be easier for individuals and small teams to modify, without nearly so much intentional malicious overcomplexity." mmmmmmm yeaaaa
[06:21:19] <coyotes4ys> "You don't have to use code from corporations at all, you can just not use it." this is what really needs to happen, yes, right now. but other things could rear their nasty heads too, things yet to even occur.

[12:57:53] <kompowiec> ach i love this moments when interlocutors name-calling me hypocrite because i have skype. Often committed with no true scotsman, where the FSF RYF criteria are invalid, it is important that they are Intel processors and therefore are nonlibre.
[13:11:41] <DiffieHellman> kompowiec: While nonfree hardware is not a nice thing, owning a particular computer does not impose others to use that particular computer.
[13:12:30] <DiffieHellman> Meanwhile, skype requires the other person to surrender their freedom, so by using skype you are imposing that other people surrender their freedom.
[13:13:49] <DiffieHellman> You need to reach rms level to have true freedom, which I personally haven't been tough enough to reach.
[13:14:27] *** Quits: taiju (~taiju@M014013236064.v4.enabler.ne.jp) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[13:16:08] <kompowiec> indeed. However, I often see messages on the FSF sites to spread free software on social networks. Tell me if I am wrong, but this is mainly about the mainstream social media, right?
[13:17:09] *** Joins: taiju (~taiju@240b:253:ec40:2400:20e3:d321:f9f8:1864)
[13:17:34] <DiffieHellman> The FSF shuns certain social media that fully imposes on others like facebook (as you can't view all posts without an account).
[13:18:10] <DiffieHellman> For the rest, the intention is to try and reach out to trapped people so they know that they can save yourself.
[13:18:13] <kompowiec> although exceptions to the rule may be dangerous, in the current world of information bubbles, there are no other options for gaining the "faithful" other than for exiting your information bubble?
[13:19:41] <kompowiec> i always propose instant messaging based on libre software first. When it fails, I have a skype which is pact with the devil. Otherwise, I break off contact.
[13:20:50] <kompowiec> In my youth I lost a lot of contacts this way because some people were so lazy that they didn't reply to SMS, they only used FB messenger which I didn't have and I will never have.
[13:20:59] <Armand> Personally, I don't see how using Skype is "surrendering" ones freedoms.
[13:21:08] <Armand> You're still free to walk away and not use it.
[13:21:53] *** Quits: amolith (~amolith@nixnet/founder/amolith) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[13:21:55] <kompowiec> Armand, i think that DiffeHellman says clearly - when you have skype, you have to force others to use this form of communication.
[13:22:29] <Armand> Somewhat inane logic.
[13:22:39] <kompowiec> why?
[13:22:56] <Armand> I don't see anyone holding a gun to someone's head.
[13:23:29] <DiffieHellman> Armand: While you can just not use proprietary software, in real life society is arranged to prevent your escape.
[13:24:10] <kompowiec> I think I know what's going on Armand. Positive/negative freedom
[13:24:49] <kompowiec> well, china social credit system it proof that using technology isn't choice anymore. And this state of violating negative freedom will continue to worsen.
[13:24:53] <Armand> Indeed.. I don't see the negative in having choices.
[13:25:25] <Armand> Personally, I'm quite reluctant to use Skype, because it's an inept pile of shit, but.. ehh
[13:25:34] <kompowiec> so I think the argument that you can get out will soon be outdated.
[13:26:04] <kompowiec> and I don't want to offend anyone here, but it's actually ergo decedo
[13:26:19] <Armand> Getting out is easy, except in the workplace.
[13:26:29] <Armand> I have to use Skype for work, no choice there.
[13:26:40] <Armand> But then, that doesn't translate to outside the workplace.
[13:27:12] <kompowiec> if I used your logic of reasoning, you might quit your job so you don't have to use skype. However, we all know here that life is much more complicated.
[13:27:33] <Armand> I could easily quit my job, but income. :P
[13:27:46] <kompowiec> inded
[13:28:21] <kompowiec> same here, if it wasn't for the income, I probably wouldn't be using the Polish craigslist-like service.
[13:28:26] <kompowiec> which required non-libre JS
[13:28:29] <DiffieHellman> Proprietary software in a job is a bit different, as you're being paid to do so. I personally don't use proprietary software unless I'm getting paid.
[13:28:58] <kompowiec> and that seems like a fair approach.
[13:28:59] *** Joins: amolith (~amolith@nixnet/founder/amolith)
[13:29:21] <kittyblam> Such a shame that pressure exists, capitalism, or more specifically corporations and other top-down structures seems to be getting in a lot of peoples way in using free software. But if its on a work computer that really only hurts the company.
[13:29:33] <kompowiec> worse when you are an entrepreneur.
[13:31:12] <kompowiec> To earn money as a seller, you need to take advantage of the network effect of the popularity of classifieds websites. This is even worse vendor-lock in than IM.
[13:41:57] <Armand> I'm looking to jump ship anyway.. Either onto another role, or another employer.
[13:46:55] <kompowiec> for example, i use OLX.pl and sprzedajemy.pl 2 most popular classield ads on poland. I sold a lot on the first one, nothing in 3 months on the second. Why did I become interested in the second website at all? Free as in beer classifieds.

[13:53:43] <kompowiec> Armand, i never used teams (micro$$$ don't allow create for me) but my buddy says that teams users can call to skype users, but it cannot be the other way around.
[13:54:05] <fef> want to use scrcpy and sndcpy kompowiec 
[13:54:13] <kompowiec> fef: VNC it's protocol so you must find approachable VNC client for android and desktop
[13:55:55] <fef> why not scrcpy? kompowiec 
[13:56:15] <kompowiec> I don't know, I just don't know this tool.
[13:56:20] <fef> its light weight
[13:56:32] <Armand> You can call in to a meeting, but the audio quality is utter jank.

[14:11:10] <jpp1> Discord is a proprietary software
[14:11:24] <kompowiec> I was two years old. It is just rubbish. Voice chat has never worked well for me.

[14:13:00] <la_mettrie> it doesn't allow custom clients
[14:13:49] <kompowiec> like most non-libre IMs

[14:17:12] <kompowiec> although I remember the times of the GG, it was officially forbidden but no one was blocking it.
[14:18:13] <kompowiec> now using pidgin for this modern IMs is practically useless. What blows me the most internally is the fact that pidgin has an official discord but doesn't officially support it.

[15:04:40] <Kaiod> Hello people, I would like to remind you to be polite and nice when communicating with other people who use proprietary software and state that. Remember that patience and politeness are virtues that must be applied, when working with the free software philosophy.
[15:04:40] <Kaiod> If someone mentions that they like a particular software because of some specific features, or just because they don't see any alternatives, consult the Free Software Directory of FSF/UNESCO.
[15:04:40] <Kaiod> Everyone's sympathy and cooperation is important, and especially that no one is obliged to know about X or Y subject. Therefore, reflect on the best approach, to facilitate education about the cause!
[15:05:29] <Kaiod> Remembering that I am not talking about a specific person, this is advice that I believe is informative for everyone
[15:06:22] <DiffieHellman> Kaiod: I don't say "alternative" as that implies that the proprietary software is acceptable to use tbh. I say "replacement".
[15:06:22] *** jobbe_ is now known as jobbe
[15:08:23] <Armand> The implication requires no validation if it is acceptable to use, tbh.
[15:10:04] <kompowiec> innded Kaiod. in the end, I assume people here are aware of the danger of proprietary software, even if they have to use it.
[15:10:34] <Armand> Now there's an implication. ;)
