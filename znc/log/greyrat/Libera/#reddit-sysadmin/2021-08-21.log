[00:07:59] <signofzeta> Yes, ticketing systems are a must.  Bonus points if it can accept incoming email and ticket-ize them.
[00:08:14] <signofzeta> Having worked for an MSP without one, working was a nightmare, and I'm told billing was a nightmare too.
[00:08:31] <signofzeta> I've used AutoTask and ConnectWise, but neither of those are free.  CW may have an on-prem version, though.
[00:08:56] <sd> 08<t​hemachine> we used autotask at my former MSP
[00:11:28] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> lolwat an MSP without a ticketing system?
[00:11:50] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> unless everything is billed flat per head/device how does that even for?
[00:13:10] <gibby> Autotrash. Thats what they should name it.
[00:13:16] <sd> 08<t​hemachine> Once upon a time they didn't have any ticketing system.

[00:16:49] * mistiry stares at @themachine
[00:16:57] <gibby> its free, but you gotta pay for support

[00:28:55] <a1> all about that bachelor life
[00:29:01] <sintax> i miss it haha
[00:29:05] <oxipital> picture of half the data from one telescopes observation of that black hole in 2019
[00:29:09] <Sousapro> does anyone know if you can restore an attachment on Jira Cloud?
[00:29:13] <oxipital> a petabyte and a half
[00:29:16] <oxipital> fucking crazy
[00:29:37] <Sousapro> I've done it plenty of times on traditional jira but it's not like I can just navigate to the directory in the cloud lol
[00:30:01] <oxipital> maybe support can
[00:31:01] <int0x1C8> oxipital, yeah that's literally why the internet was created
[00:31:10] <sintax> for selfies?
[00:31:13] <int0x1C8> science produces a shitload of data
[00:31:15] <oxipital> what that data?
[00:31:18] <oxipital> they shipped it
[00:31:24] <oxipital> snail mail
[00:31:28] <int0x1C8> no scientific data in general
[00:31:33] <oxipital> well yeah
[00:31:41] <int0x1C8> at CERN it was particle collision data
[00:31:41] <oxipital> that and a nuke proof communication network
[00:32:34] <oxipital> what im impressed with is that that is comprised of separate detections by the telescope's detector array at the same ti,e
[00:32:35] <int0x1C8> or rather the raw output of specially arranged particle detectors
[00:32:38] *** Quits: sintax (~sintax@user/sintax) (Quit: WeeChat 2.8)

[00:35:50] <int0x1C8> what synthetic aperture detection and sensing techniques?
[00:36:28] <oxipital> inferometry
[00:36:50] <int0x1C8> we've had these kind of instruments and knowledge for a long time, what should impress more is the sheer scale
[00:37:12] <oxipital> yeah, designed for a synthetic aperture roughly the size of the planet
[00:37:38] <oxipital> and whats amazing to me is that all that data ends up as a relatively small image
[00:37:50] <oxipital> the actual hole is 40 microarcseconds big
[00:37:51] <int0x1C8> right, I'm saying the method isn't new, the scale is
[00:39:52] <int0x1C8> wait what were the actual pixel dimensions of the image it created again?
[00:40:55] <oxipital> shit if i know. i didnt read the paper that came with the picture
[00:41:50] <oxipital> data transmission time is estimated tp be 25 years over the internet
[00:42:07] <oxipital> and its an interpolated image of data through time
[00:42:55] <int0x1C8> it's available on wikimedia with 4320x4320 as max size
[00:44:30] <int0x1C8> yeah it's a reconstructed image, well pixel dimensions of the actual image is a poorly defined concept anyway
[00:44:34] <Activ8> oxipital, the best thing you can do is get a demo running and a play about.  Hell stick it on a desktop if you have to switched on somewhere
[00:44:52] <oxipital> Activ8: that's probably what ill end up doing
[00:45:07] <oxipital> see if i can get our central datacenter to stick an entry in dns
[00:45:25] <Activ8> you have your own vps somewhere right? 
[00:45:30] <oxipital> save me managing it and security audits etc, just lean on preexisting desktop management
[00:46:02] <Activ8> indeed
[00:49:41] <Activ8> oxipital - Activ8: any idea the cost of their vsa? uhm nope but for just one or two queues you don't need a vsa
[00:50:07] <oxipital> i just want something i can plop downj
[00:50:13] <Activ8> if you really need to run it in a docker container on your own machine as localhost
[00:50:20] <oxipital> if setups easy enough youre right
[00:50:21] <Activ8> they got a docker now
[00:50:31] <Activ8> docker container*
[00:50:43] <Activ8> you can have it running in 5 clicks lol
[00:51:03] <oxipital> hrm
[00:51:04] <Activ8> assuming you know docker
[00:51:07] <Activ8> https://hub.docker.com/r/osticket/osticket

[00:51:12] <oxipital> running osticket
[00:51:15] * oxipital likes it
[00:51:21] <oxipital> sufficiently arcane
[00:51:29] <Activ8> I forgot to mention it, wasn't sure if you used docker or not
[00:51:35] <oxipital> i can
[00:51:39] <Activ8> docker pull osticket/osticket
[00:51:43] <oxipital> its outside the job desc

[00:51:46] <oxipital> but whatever
[00:51:58] <Activ8> will there be only you using this ticket system or others
[00:52:06] <oxipital> me for right now
[00:53:31] <Activ8> couple ways you can do it, you could even host it on a web host like fasthosts (as example) I know it works as I tried it.  Fast hosts was just an example host.
[00:53:35] <oxipital> the wsl part might be a stopping block for docker
[00:53:52] <oxipital> so long as its free
[00:53:58] <oxipital> i'll look in to it
[00:54:06] <Activ8> good stuff
[00:55:13] *** Quits: signofzeta (~signofzet@user/signofzeta) (Remote host closed the connection)
[00:55:22] <Activ8> with docker you would need 2 containers, one mysql container and one the osticket container.  You can run 1 command though to get that pulled and running.
[00:55:38] *** Joins: signofzeta (~signofzet@user/signofzeta)
[00:57:43] <oxipital> sure
[00:57:59] <oxipital> i have to look at whether there's some gpo limiting getting wsl running
[00:58:54] <Activ8> yeh, does it have to be on a domain system though not standalone, could run it just on a linux box, another alternitive 
[01:02:02] <Activ8> https://osticket.com/editions/ - 9$ per month per user
[01:02:10] <Activ8> cloud hosted by osticket
[01:03:09] <mistiry> this has got to be the longest a single topic has been discussed in here. i was gone for like an hour and you guys are still talking about osticket
[01:03:17] <oxipital> oh sorry
[01:03:27] <Activ8> nope, we where both away for a bit then come back
[01:03:36] <Activ8> I been watching a film n I saw the word osticket flag up lol
[01:03:40] <oxipital> yeah i had to go help someone with a headset
[01:03:53] <Activ8> 30 day free trial oxi
[01:03:57] <mistiry> did they put in a ticket?
[01:04:01] <mistiry> :D
[01:04:08] <oxipital> nope
[01:04:10] <oxipital> walked in
[01:04:14] <oxipital> said come help me
[01:04:32] <Activ8> that's the only thing about using a ticket system, uses that walk in on you
[01:04:47] <Activ8> I don't get that issue cos all mine is remote 
[01:04:50] <oxipital> walked off. i couldnt find him
[01:04:51] <mistiry> thats when you tell them they need to submit a ticket first
[01:04:53] <oxipital> waljked the campus
[01:04:55] <Activ8> I'm no where near my users
[01:05:02] <oxipital> couldnt find him. came back
[01:06:12] <Activ8> the beauty of a ticket system is stats.  Find out where users need training or when new hardware needs to be purchased or reoccuring problems that could be stopped all together.
[01:06:52] <Activ8> the majority of our tickets is 0365 creating new users as staff leave/return/new e.t.c
[01:07:01] <oxipital> the beauty is i can put a stop to shit like the walkjing in, no name and just walking off
[01:07:35] <Activ8> "can you log it as a ticket please" then they say "how do I do that". 
[01:07:47] <mistiry> then you point them to the documentation 
[01:07:57] <Activ8> our users just email an address the ticket system polls it every 5 mins
[01:08:08] <Activ8> I get no users calling me
[01:08:30] <mistiry> "i dont know how to put in a ticket" is not a problem to fix technically. thats a training/management issue.
[01:08:36] <oxipital> yeah
[01:08:48] <Activ8> oh yeh sure I get it
[01:09:03] <Activ8> I know but at first this is what you get when training users to log tickets
[01:09:13] <mistiry> well, sure
[01:09:15] <PublicWiFi> 20 mins fellas
[01:09:21] <mistiry> thats true for any new system you implement
[01:09:27] <Activ8> ofc

[01:11:46] <Activ8> you what? you got another job with a 5 min interview? lol
[01:11:52] <oxipital> yeah
[01:12:01] <oxipital> helpdesk
[01:12:07] <Activ8> you kidding me lmao

[01:12:14] <Activ8> first task - impliment a service desk solution
[01:12:16] <Activ8> hahahha
[01:12:26] <oxipital> so if i can squeeze more money out of the contracting company i'm set
[01:12:34] <oxipital> if not, then i'll sit here and set up osticket
[01:12:36] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> I always forget that the -out command doesn't default to the local path
[01:12:43] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> LIKE IT SHOULD
[01:13:01] <Activ8> a bit of a tip, squeeze every penny you can out of your employer
[01:13:06] <Activ8> if you don't someone else will
[01:15:16] <oxipital> yup
[01:15:30] <mistiry> how long have you been in help desk?
[01:15:42] <oxipital> personally?
[01:15:47] <oxipital> 11 years
[01:15:50] <Activ8> I was in helpdesk 16 years ago
[01:15:57] <oxipital> five or so includes sys admin tasks
[01:16:10] <oxipital> but most of thats been when i was responsible for everything
[01:16:18] <mistiry> why are you taking help desk interviews then?
[01:16:23] <Activ8> then moved to tier 2, stopped tier 2 for about 10 years, tier 1 was a couple years
[01:16:26] <oxipital> easy out for me
[01:16:58] <oxipital> i hate this job; it was listed as sys admin; even the advertised job desc and interview talked about it from a sys admin perspective.
[01:17:23] <oxipital> can you manage servers. we're in the process of hiring someone additional to handle issues
[01:17:37] <oxipital> come in, its an office thats been empty since april
[01:18:00] <oxipital> servers, iam, etc etc all done remotely by a government datacenter
[01:18:25] <oxipital> the second person is "not justified by the staff we have"
[01:18:39] <Activ8> you have to think, if it's easy money you sit n take it
[01:18:54] <oxipital> they now say i have to support virtual/distance students and give presentations about using their chromebooks ,etc
[01:19:12] <oxipital> Activ8: yeah
[01:19:30] <oxipital> i think shielding myself behind ticketing would make it an easy job
[01:19:34] <Activ8> oh ffs lol I hate that side of tech
[01:19:43] <oxipital> if there's the required discipline for users
[01:19:51] <mistiry> will your manage support you if you implement a ticket system?
[01:19:54] <mistiry> manager*
[01:20:02] <oxipital> she says she will
[01:20:03] <oxipital> but...
[01:20:17] <oxipital> she hasn't really supported me yet.
[01:20:40] <oxipital> so i have a memo in my file (not a write up, promise)
[01:21:10] <oxipital> i used to really like it, but after moving out here it sucks.
[01:21:18] <oxipital> it=IT
[01:21:44] <mistiry> i mean, 11 years of help desk 
[01:21:46] <mistiry> i'd hate it too
[01:22:04] <oxipital> i don't mind help desk if the userbase is interesting
[01:22:09] <oxipital> i loved helping scientists
[01:22:17] <oxipital> cpas
[01:22:23] <Activ8> IT ain't easy.  What I do now I love as it's managing servers all remotely  the ticket system is just to make my life easier
[01:22:42] <oxipital> this place just attracts people looking for a pay check and there's zero accountability
[01:23:05] <oxipital> the only way to get fired is to piss off the leadership or miss three days with no call
[01:23:08] <mistiry> i work off tickets too. just not end user tickets.
[01:23:08] *** Quits: sintax (~sintax@user/sintax) (Quit: WeeChat 2.8)
[01:23:31] <oxipital> i need it for order and accountability
[01:23:48] <Activ8> you know what
[01:23:48] <oxipital> and thought i could just stand up a vm or even a process on a physical box
[01:23:59] <oxipital> but i have zero control of any of that
[01:24:08] <mistiry> thats why your manager needs to back you on it
[01:24:13] <Activ8> osticket does an email trail so if a user emails in with an update or response it updates on THAT ticket.  It's pretty swish for that.
[01:24:14] <oxipital> yeah i know
[01:24:16] <mistiry> and you need to be pushing for it constantly
[01:24:22] <Activ8> so from a paper trail it's pretty good
[01:24:38] <Activ8> you email/message from the ticket system as well as long as you have the smtp email configured
[01:24:50] <mistiry> pretty standard features for a ticket system
[01:25:16] <Activ8> yeh but I'm comparing considering it's free is what I'm getting at
[01:25:45] <oxipital> yeah i'll go ahead and pull the trigger regardless 
[01:26:04] <Activ8> mistiry what tickets do you do on a day-day
[01:27:19] <mistiry> new azure resource deployments, new server setups, system upgrade/update/replacements, cloud networking stuff, occasional VPN or networking help just because i have the most knowledge on certain things
[01:27:44] <mistiry> linux system issues
[01:27:46] <mistiry> uhh
[01:27:53] <mistiry> idk, stuff like that
[01:27:58] <mistiry> but im only 2 months in so far
[01:27:58] <Activ8> ditto, I do them what you mention as well
[01:28:13] <mistiry> 2 months at this place, that is
[01:28:28] <haise01> those tickets look like fun things to do
[01:28:41] <Activ8> I do a lot of vpn setups
[01:29:07] <mistiry> i did that at the last job
[01:29:26] <oxipital> i really just need to get certified/lie about cert for azure
[01:29:27] <PublicWiFi> have a good weekend fellas
[01:29:33] <oxipital> later
[01:29:41] <Activ8> I have no qualifications I just got lucky
[01:29:46] <mistiry> i dont have any certs either
[01:29:50] <mistiry> at least not for azure
[01:29:54] <mistiry> just experience
[01:29:56] <oxipital> i really dont have any either except experience
[01:29:56] <Activ8> I don't intent to either
[01:30:12] <oxipital> id kill for a nice easy wfh job
[01:30:22] <Activ8> to be honest it's my mains business, I just help him out paid ofc
[01:30:25] <oxipital> i'd be fine with resetting passwords if it was just laidback
[01:30:34] <mistiry> i can spend 2 months learning how to answer the specific questions to pass a test or i can spend those 2 months learning by actually using and doing the things
[01:30:50] <Activ8> my hours vary each week. but I get a min payout regardless of what happens
[01:31:13] <Activ8> I have never been a fan of tech exams
[01:31:30] <Activ8> a guy I know had that many qualifications he couldn't write them all on his arm
[01:31:35] <Activ8> he was a manager
[01:31:50] <Activ8> always fucked up tasks and other people had to bail him out
[01:32:32] <mistiry> i was part in hiring a guy that literally came into the interview with a binder full of printed certificate of whatever-the-fucks. wasnt for an IT job but for a technical support role, and he checked enough boxes for me to pass him up the chain, and they hired him. 
[01:32:41] <mistiry> knew NOTHING. could retain NOTHING.
[01:33:01] <mistiry> literally asked the same questions every day
[01:33:37] <Activ8> meh I think when it comes to tech interviews it's best to say "how would you handle this situation" e.t.c
[01:33:49] <Activ8> tech exams are just meh 
[01:34:08] <mistiry> but it wasnt even at that level. position was basically entry level tech support.
[01:34:19] <haise01> jeez lol
[01:34:21] <mistiry> so there wasnt a whole lot technical to dig into in the inteview
[01:34:53] <oxipital> did they fire him?
[01:34:56] <mistiry> yes
[01:34:58] <Activ8> interesting, I think some people who are been interviewed sometimes like to think themselves as geeks unless they a lot older
[01:34:59] <oxipital> or is he an it director now
[01:36:01] <mistiry> nah this was at a small place. you had to actually know wtf you were doing or it was pretty obvious who was the problem
[01:36:16] <sd> 08<t​hemachine> the integration between this server and IRC is freaky
[01:36:19] <Activ8> spit the right info out at an interview and normally you get hired if the interviewers hear what they want to hear
[01:36:24] <sd> 08<t​hemachine> do IRC users see this via bot too?
[01:36:30] <haise01> yes
[01:36:38] <Activ8> why is it freaky? it's just a bridge
[01:36:38] <sd> 13<m​oquito64> knew a network engineer (to this day smartest guy Ive met) never went to school. Dropped out of highschool. Skateboard/punk type. Tons of people passed on him.

[01:36:43] <DomLS3> "How many cows are in Wisconsin"
[01:36:58] <DomLS3> Someone asks me some stupid ass question like that in an interview, I get up and walk out immediately
[01:37:08] <oxipital> yeah
[01:37:09] <Activ8> moquito I have seen that happen before as well
[01:37:16] <mistiry> @moquito64 thats why i will take experience and a competent technical discussion over education any day
[01:37:21] <oxipital> i fucking hate people who try to challenge you in an interview
[01:37:30] <oxipital> i had a interview for a os upgrade project
[01:37:33] <Activ8>  a lad I know did his ccie in his own time, went to sit the exam and moved to london as a design engineer over night
[01:37:41] <oxipital> american dude, dude from a certain subcontinent
[01:37:44] <DomLS3> oxipital: being challenged in an interview is ok... as long as the challenge fits the job
[01:38:11] <Activ8> went from 13K basic job back in 2008 right the way to a 100k job one friday night once he past his ccie lol
[01:38:15] <oxipital> i was like "yeah i use powershell and hyperv module to take snapshots etc"
[01:38:36] <oxipital> subcontinent dude is like 'i prefer gui. quick tell me cmd for snapshot'
[01:38:45] <mistiry> Activ8: certs help if you dont have experience. once you have experience, the certs are a footnote

[01:38:52] <oxipital> yeah
[01:39:03] <Activ8> mistiry indeed I agree
[01:39:27] <DomLS3> mistiry: unless it's in healthcare or government sector. Then certs are usually higher than experience but not in all cases
[01:39:29] <sd> 13<m​oquito64> and ive had an employer request me to get certs(they paid) just so we could check some boxes
[01:39:37] <Activ8> I think I was lucky, I did some of my old school certs while on the job was few years training with a portfolio back in 2000
[01:39:41] <Activ8> 2001
[01:40:18] <oxipital> i've had same. got some sas reporting training out of it
[01:40:24] <oxipital> good deal for everyone involved
[01:40:26] <Activ8> I never did sas

[01:41:13] <oxipital> if you know your way around sas you can name your price
[01:41:18] <haise01> so I can start hunting for some internships while I study in college
[01:41:20] <Activ8> mind you I got on the job training, remember doing an exchange, server + desktop back in 2004 as it was needed to do a migration on 6000 desktops
[01:41:29] <Activ8> sccm was just becoming mainstream
[01:41:41] <Activ8> that project was in 2012
[01:42:11] <oxipital> i was using sccm then

[01:43:23] <Activ8> I just been watching videos on intune and autopilot I haven't got a clue how to impliment them but I understand what they are for.  Seems to be the norm now in mainstream networks
[01:44:47] <Activ8> We did a 20 server sccm project on 6 satalite sites at the time, each satalite site had 1000 desktops for staff/student along with 1000 voip phone deployment across each sector. biggest project Iv
[01:44:53] <Activ8> I have been involved in
[01:45:05] <oxipital> thats the kind of shit that gets me excited
[01:45:12] <Activ8> you should seen the kit turn up
[01:46:02] <Activ8> 6 full wagons a week with new desktops, servers, phones e.t.c
[01:46:09] <oxipital> heh
[01:46:18] <oxipital> who designed it?
[01:46:22] <Activ8> our core switches where 50k each, 2 per site
[01:46:27] <oxipital> thats what really gets my blood

[04:42:02] <CableNinja> rpifan, devops is sysadmin with... different steps
[04:42:14] <PattyCakes> incorrect
[04:43:21] <CableNinja> depends on the area you're in
[04:43:47] <CableNinja> theres 2 kinds of devops, theres people who write code all day as devops and theres people who do infra shit all day as devops

[04:52:29] <CableNinja> yeah the company I worked for built their own shit on android and ios systems and did all of the integration themselves, or as much of it as they could, and we had some huge names, so much so that at any one time we could be doing 1mil orders a minute
[04:52:32] <PattyCakes> that did NOT go well
[04:53:13] <CableNinja> on certain days we could easily break 18milion requests / minute
[04:53:28] <rpifan> no one has answered is there a good brand of hot dogs in australia

[13:11:22] <haise01> I have like 
[13:11:28] <haise01> 96-112 GB K8s cluster
[13:11:35] <haise01> that runs my entire self host stack
[13:11:47] <nobyk> I'm very content I tried them out
[13:11:56] <nobyk> they save so much resources, compared to kvm
[13:12:01] <nobyk> very light
[13:12:07] <nobyk> Which, I suppose is the point of containers
[13:12:07] <Activ8> Activ8: it doesn't take that much but its so worth it in the long run - not really, the cost for storage outweighs the cost to stream lol
[13:12:16] <sd> 08<J​TR> very insecure

[13:12:44] <haise01> Activ8: my 80 Ts of usable storage setup costed me around $2.5k
[13:12:49] <haise01> TBs*
[13:12:55] <nobyk> elaborate if you like
[13:13:04] <Activ8> that's ridicules lol
[13:13:09] <sd> 12<p​yathalon> well i have low self esteem
[13:13:14] <yuken> 80TB isn'rt that much.
[13:13:22] <nobyk> what
[13:13:25] <haise01> mfw
[13:13:29] <haise01> It is more than enough for me
[13:13:33] <nobyk> Yes it is.. guys?
[13:13:55] <nobyk> What is this for tho?
[13:13:59] <Activ8> you missing the point 2.5k could probably get you 40 years of streaming lol
[13:14:12] <nobyk> Still for.. streaming content storage?
[13:14:16] <yuken> Activ8, half of what I've watched in the past is no longer available to be streamed.
[13:14:23] <haise01> ^
[13:14:23] <Activ8> i see
[13:14:32] <haise01> Tell me where I can get movie from 1920s lol
[13:14:34] <nobyk> Do you get like, 4k stuff?
[13:14:42] <haise01> nobyk: 1080p shit here lol
[13:14:43] <nobyk> oh.. I guess not then
[13:14:51] <yuken> Movies from the 1920s can be 4k.
[13:14:54] <sd> 12<p​yathalon> 1920s, best bet is youtube lol
[13:15:04] <haise01> I got what I wanted from Usenet
[13:15:05] <nobyk> People who 'download' 4k are suckers
[13:15:07] <nobyk> They're not worth it
[13:15:15] <nobyk> I have decided this
[13:15:36] <nobyk> The increase in quality in my opinion does not outweigh the extra load on your infra
[13:15:57] <sd> 12<p​yathalon> Yea but I delete everything after I watch it
[13:16:11] <yuken> Imagine not keeping all your videos forever.
[13:16:21] <nobyk> Yeah kinda weird but understandable
[13:16:22] <sd> 12<p​yathalon> I've probably downloaded about 50 blurays that I never watched and then deleted
[13:16:29] <CptLuxx> good
[13:16:37] <CptLuxx> then isps are forced to upgrade
[13:16:43] <nobyk> lol
[13:16:45] <CptLuxx> everyone should download as much as possible
[13:17:01] <nobyk> I'll setup a botnet and just start running iperf all the time
[13:17:06] <sd> 08<J​TR> nobyk: see e.g. NIST SP 800-190 & the endless flood of container escape CVEs
[13:17:21] <nobyk> JTR You're on to something
[13:17:26] <nobyk> Especially now with deb11
[13:17:38] <nobyk> for LXC on proxmox, nesting has to be enabled for it to work properly
[13:17:58] <nobyk> but this, if I'm not wrong right?!, decreases security as you now share more stuff with the actual host
[13:18:03] <nobyk> so I don't get how this is acceptable
[13:18:08] <nobyk> I hope I'm wrong
[13:19:26] <sd> 08<J​TR> also, see google's work on isolation and how they run containerized workloads for GCP.
[13:19:45] <nobyk> I've tried bringing this up at ##proxmox once but it seems all they talk about is storage
[13:20:01] <sd> 08<J​TR> another problem is that many base images are poorly maintained at best
[13:20:24] <nobyk> Well, maintain your own images? solved
[13:20:26] <sd> 08<J​TR> yet another is the usually poor defaults for popular base images
[13:21:20] <nobyk> It's very easy to get your own LXC images, especially on proxmox
[13:21:21] <nobyk> imo
[13:21:36] <nobyk> Get the default one or whatever, harden that and zip it
[13:21:37] <nobyk> done
[13:22:08] <sd> 08<J​TR> nobyk: the amount of "unnecessary" time & effort (both initial and ongoing) involved in doing that is insane
[13:22:34] <nobyk> Also like, ansible is a thing
[13:22:52] <nobyk> Why do you feel it is unnecessary?
[13:24:50] <haise01> nobyk: I personally never used LXC
[13:25:06] <haise01> went straight to Docker then swapped it for Podman and upgrade server side to K8s with CRI-O
[13:25:16] <sd> 08<J​TR> at least in the corporate software development world, proposing to spend that kind of time on what is perceived as reinventing the wheel when a seemingly (at first glance) perfectly good base image already exists is quite difficult to get prioritized (or even approved)
[13:25:41] <nobyk> well the only reason I use it is because I'm on proxmox and it's kinda builtin
[13:25:52] <haise01> ah Proxmox
[13:25:58] <haise01> I use KVM but not on Proxmox
[13:26:01] <nobyk> :D
[13:26:03] <sd> 08<J​TR> of course taking these kinds of shortcuts tends to come back and bite you down the line in fun and exciting ways
[13:26:03] <haise01> I am virt-manager gang
[13:26:07] <nobyk> cockpit?
[13:26:08] <nobyk> ah
[13:26:09] <nobyk> cool
[13:26:13] <haise01> I run SLES
[13:26:18] <haise01> ssh key copied to host
[13:26:23] <haise01> and just auth to it using virt-manager
[13:26:28] <haise01> easy enough
[13:26:28] <nobyk> I'm not entirely sure what that is but it sounds familiar
[13:26:36] <haise01> SLES ?
[13:26:48] <nobyk> and virt-manager
[13:26:55] <haise01> SLES is Linux distro for servers 
[13:26:58] <haise01> from SUSE
[13:27:04] <nobyk> I mean I imagine it's a cockpit alternative
[13:27:10] <haise01> and virt-manager, its GUI for KVM
[13:27:13] <haise01> GTK3 based iirc
[13:27:27] <nobyk> webgui?
[13:27:36] <haise01> nope
[13:27:45] <haise01> standard GUI application
[13:28:32] <haise01> I will start replacing virt-manager with Terraform
[13:28:37] <haise01> I mean I already have
[13:28:46] <haise01> but there are some non moving parts I can't touch yet
[13:29:33] <nobyk> gtg

[15:50:11] <corn266> please mista

[15:53:20] <sd> 13<C​olour> Why would you need THAT?
[15:55:57] <corn266> cause, and i may be rarted, but spotify only offers a .deb install and idc about seeing it in my browser
[15:59:58] <haise01> corn266: you need to install gnome-tweaks
[16:00:07] <haise01> and there should be setting for minimizing and maximizing 
[16:00:18] <haise01> and for Spotify
[16:00:24] <haise01> install it through flatpak
[16:00:30] <haise01> .deb doesn't work on Fedora
[16:00:44] <corn266> yea
[16:00:58] <corn266> okay lemme try those things
[16:01:25] <haise01> When I want to daily drive Linux on my computer
[16:01:35] <haise01> I usually go for Fedora or openSUSE with KDE as desktop environment
[16:03:08] <corn266> i was about to install manjaro but i selected the wrong boot device and apparently i already had fedora 29 installed lol
[16:04:32] <haise01> I don't like Manjaro or Arch based distros tbh
[16:05:09] <corn266> do i need to restart for gnome-tweeks to take affect?
[16:05:17] <corn266> i don't mind them, really
[16:06:00] <corn266> once you get to a certain linux level and want a daily driver you really just have to learn the package manager(s)
[16:06:32] <haise01> corn266: It doesnt need restart afaik
[16:07:00] <haise01> I usually stick RPM based distros for my stuff

[16:07:31] <corn266> yea that's fair to an extent
[16:07:51] <corn266> but it's not like i'd be running RHEL as my dd
[16:07:59] <haise01> openSUSE :D
[16:08:06] <haise01> Tumbleweed is a fantastic dd
[16:08:15] <corn266> never used openSUSE
[16:08:20] <haise01> I run it on my main computer at home
[16:08:23] <haise01> and it works great
[16:08:30] <corn266> interdesting
[16:08:37] <corn266> might spin up a VM for it
[16:08:37] <haise01> YaST is great as well
[16:08:53] <haise01> cause when I install stuff I don't have to guess name of packages like for example Mesa drivers
[16:08:56] <corn266> so many flavors of linux you'd think they were vaginas
[16:09:03] <haise01> I just go into YaST and query repos for Mesa
