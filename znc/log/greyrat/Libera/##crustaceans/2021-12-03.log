[00:18:53] <manicennui> Same as always.
[00:19:21] <manicennui> I just learned that MS Edge is available for OS X, iOS, Android, and Linux. Why?

[01:05:18] <indigo> Brekkjern: Don't get the omicron!
[01:05:43] <Brekkjern> indigo: I'm not planning to get it, but I can't make any guarantees!
[01:10:04] <dimadima> i use edge for all my needs
[01:10:25] <dimadima> especially when i need to break purchases down into 4 easy payments of $29.99
[01:16:03] * manicennui doesn't understand why one of his coworkers is acting like an Optimizely salesperson. 
[01:16:21] <manicennui> We already have a contract with them. We don't have a choice in the matter.
[01:21:45] <indigo> Is it the season of A/B testing where you're at too, manicennui?
[01:22:00] <manicennui> indigo: Yeah, we ran out of ideas, so now we use Optimizely.
[01:22:11] <manicennui> The tests they come up with are dumb as hell.
[01:22:23] <manicennui> It's clear they are out of ideas and just throwing shit against the wall.

[01:25:07] <Brekkjern> I mean... You're free to fuck up the bootloader in Windows
[01:25:07] <dimadima> that's not a bad concept but i believe the first sentence there is not something i've seen anything do except npm
[01:25:12] <Brekkjern> Shit's gonna break anyhow.
[01:26:13] <manicennui> Brekkjern: In Linux there is a nice package you can remove.
[01:26:40] <manicennui> I demand ergonomic footguns.
[01:26:46] <Brekkjern> I was about to say...
[01:26:52] <Brekkjern> "I fail to see how this is a good thing"
[01:27:23] <manicennui> Joking aside, it is a good feature because I can actually replace it with another bootloader easily.
[01:27:31] <manicennui> Nearly the entire system is just packages.
[01:27:47] <dimadima> no way uninstalling a bootload package uninstalls the bootloader?
[01:28:16] <manicennui> dimadima: I mean, what do you expect to happen if you remove grub?
[01:28:56] <indigo> Reminds me of the Linus Tech Tips experience
[01:28:57] <dimadima> the grub utils to get removed
[01:30:47] <gwozniak> Watched some of a talk by a Microsoft employee at some conference and one of their slides had "LMBTFY" with a link
[01:31:04] <gwozniak> All I could think was, "Uh, no"
[01:31:47] <gwozniak> "Google" as a verb, despite my distaste for it, will never be replaced by "Bing"
[01:32:03] <ngoldbaum> was it a james mickens talk?
[01:32:17] <gwozniak> No
[01:32:31] <gwozniak> If it was Mickens, it would have been entertaining
[01:32:48] <gwozniak> The talk was fine, but the guy is no comedian
[01:32:49] <manicennui> dimadima: I suppose it is possible that it leaves /boot alone and things will still work.
[01:34:29] <manicennui> dimadima: It's clearly copying something some bit of grub code there to work. Seems odd that it would leave it if the package is removed, but I guess it probably doesn't know where you have copied things after the package is added.

[01:37:32] <gwozniak> I do just fine with the results from it
[01:37:38] <dimadima> interesting search engine post on HN
[01:37:45] <dimadima> well, the thread anyway
[01:38:04] <gwozniak> My wife has to use Edge at work.  I don't think she actually uses it much
[01:38:46] <gwozniak> I've looked at it but I can't see the benefits (aside from apparently saving money, so I'm told`
[01:38:57] <dimadima> who needs a browser when you can have APPS
[01:39:09] <bkero> What do you think your apps are? Heh.
[01:39:18] <dimadima> gwozniak: how do you save money with edge

[01:40:00] <ngoldbaum> the website was the friends we made along thebway
[01:40:21] <dimadima> oh netscape navigator 4.7
[01:40:46] <dimadima> so funny the internet economy turned out the way it turned out
[01:41:31] <gwozniak> dimadima: I saw some screenshot recently where Edge or Windows will show a notification telling you that you can save money with Edge.  I guess it shows up when you install Chrome or something. I'll see if I can dig it up

[01:43:23] <dimadima> all those blinking under construction sites weren't charming to me then, either
[01:43:55] <manicennui> How were you supposed to let users know that you were still working on a particular part of the site?!
[01:43:55] <dimadima> i do miss 16 bit (8, even) color and "colorsafe" palettes
[01:44:26] <dimadima> manicennui: you got me there

[01:44:55] <manicennui> No, under construction pages.
[01:44:57] <dimadima> i dunno 1997-1999 were, you know
[01:45:06] <dimadima> funky times
[01:45:17] <manicennui> They were the best of times, and the worst of times.

[02:22:03] <dimadima> like also there's no flu going around

[02:27:14] <manicennui> They don't actually have principles

[02:59:29] <dimadima> RiiR
[02:59:33] <Brekkjern> The URL isn't the problem actually
[02:59:38] <Brekkjern> It's my shit code :P
[03:00:06] <Brekkjern> It fetches the site just fine, and then it looks for <title> and </title> and grabs the text between those tags
[03:00:12] <ngoldbaum> sure but also it amuses me that the cursed jestjs use of a special in-band key to add comments to json also kills the bot
[03:00:37] <ngoldbaum> named ‚Äú//‚Äú
[03:00:43] <dimadima> does that not work if they're on different lines
[03:01:18] <Brekkjern> But that page has two titles for some reason, and the first one has styling info so it tries to slice in a really fucked up way.
[03:02:24] <Brekkjern> >panic: runtime error: slice bounds out of range [5121:1401]
[03:02:53] <ngoldbaum> totally normal slice range
[03:03:02] <dimadima> multiple titles? title with styling info?
[03:03:09] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[03:03:11] <Brekkjern> That page is cursed
[03:03:35] <dimadima> how does <title> have styling info?
[03:03:40] <dimadima> what does that even mean
[03:03:43] <Brekkjern> 5121 is the index of the second <title> tag, and 1401 is the first </title> tag
[03:03:53] <Brekkjern> I'm not sure it is styling, but it is extra shit on the tag
[03:04:45] <dimadima> Brekkjern: can yuo please paste the URL?
[03:04:57] <Brekkjern> It's the one ngoldbaum pasted above
[03:04:58] <dimadima> maybe so it doesn't freak out buttsbot
[03:04:59] <dimadima> ah
[03:05:24] <Brekkjern> I think you need to curl it, because I believe some JS changes the title
[03:05:34] <ngoldbaum> jestjs has webscale docs
[03:05:39] <dimadima> intense
[03:06:47] <Brekkjern> This is what trips it up:
[03:06:47] <Brekkjern> First title: <title data-react-helmet="true">Configuring Jest ¬∑ Jest</title>
[03:06:47] <Brekkjern> Second title: <title>Menu</title>
[03:07:40] <Brekkjern> So it catches the index of <title> of the second tag, and for the </title> of the first one, making a slice that goes backwards
[03:07:46] <Brekkjern> Which makes zero sense to Go
[03:07:53] <indigo> Are you trying to parse HTML with regex :P
[03:08:10] <Brekkjern> No. Just IndexOf or whatever it is
[03:08:34] <Brekkjern> What I should do is to parse it as HTML and grab the title from the structure of the document
[03:08:39] <Brekkjern> But that would be proper code
[03:09:44] <dimadima> you have to write the sax parse yourself
[03:09:48] <dimadima> parser
[03:09:50] <indigo> I used a good html parsing library a while back
[03:10:15] <Brekkjern> Eh, the standard one is probably just fine for this
[03:10:26] <Brekkjern> But then I'd have to code it to use it
[03:10:27] <Brekkjern> So...
[03:10:38] <Brekkjern> Maybe I'll do it after the last exam

[03:10:58] <indigo> The standard one? Heh, good luck :-)
[03:11:19] <Brekkjern> I don't actually give many shits about the quality as long as I can find a title tag though :P
[03:11:28] <indigo> You will literally need to walk the tree if you use the standard one
[03:11:35] <Brekkjern> :S
[03:12:04] <Brekkjern> Well, I now know how to invert one, so walking it should be easy üôÑ

[03:15:00] <indigo> Brekkjern: If you want a referral...
[03:15:11] <Brekkjern> indigo: For Google? Eh... I'd rather not :P
[03:15:42] <Brekkjern> At least not right now.
[03:16:54] <indigo> No worries
[03:19:55] <indigo> I guess walking the tree isn't *that* bad tbh
[03:20:32] <indigo> I'm just too used to "easy" APIs
[03:20:42] <indigo> CSS selectors ftw
[03:23:50] <Brekkjern> Bleh. I should go to bed. Night!
[03:25:46] <indigo> Good night!!
[03:27:45] <indigo> Ah shit, I wanted to ask him about the Gathering
[03:27:46] <indigo> Oh well
[03:30:09] <Brekkjern> Go ahead, indigo :P
[03:30:14] <indigo> Hahah
[03:30:25] <indigo> Do you happen to know a Martin Sandsmark?
[03:31:22] <Brekkjern> I know the name, but I don't know him personally
[03:31:37] <Brekkjern> The reMarkable guy, right?
[03:32:06] <indigo> Yeah! He used to do stuff for the Gathering, and I was just curious if y'all knew each other cause I saw the badge on your github
[03:32:41] <Brekkjern>  I believe he still does, but we're in separate parts of the crew
[03:33:07] <indigo> Gotcha. Just curious :-) have a good night dude
[03:33:11] <Brekkjern> Crew is only about 300 people large though, so it's not huge
[03:33:42] <Brekkjern>  I am also probably not participating next year since I kinda want to get progress on my studies
[03:34:01] <indigo> Always good to take a break
[03:34:08] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[03:34:49] <Brekkjern> It is possible that I could stumble across him tomorrow at NDC. reMarkable has a stand there
[03:35:22] <Brekkjern> I asked them if they would make me a version without any wireless chips and they turned me down :(
[03:36:34] <indigo> Can't you just turn off the wireless? Or does it still eat battery?
[03:37:21] <Brekkjern> I can't have devices with antennas at work
[03:37:41] <Brekkjern> Making it kinda pointless
[03:38:07] <indigo> Right
[03:38:26] <indigo> Reminds me of defense contracting and how we couldn't have devices with cameras in certain areas
[03:38:43] <indigo> There is a service that you can send your iPhone to, and they will remove the camera
[03:39:11] <Brekkjern> Hmm. That's a good point. Does it have a camera too?
[03:39:16] <manicennui> They should just give you Razrs from the 90s.
[03:39:23] <Brekkjern> Lol
[03:40:22] <indigo> No camera on the reMarkable
[03:40:51] <Brekkjern> Well. The wireless chip is still a no-go, so...
[03:41:12] <Brekkjern> But now I really do have to go to bed :P
[03:41:15] <Brekkjern> Night
[03:47:22] <manicennui> I was off last week and can't get back into the swing of things at work.
[03:47:49] <manicennui> I need to retire.

[07:44:44] <imode> specifically I hate people who think that bringing in every unneeded feature is equivalent with "smart programming".
[07:45:13] <imode> I had this reasonably written piece of code, they suggested I start adding lombok annotations to autogenerate builders and stop returning explicitly allocated instances.
[07:45:33] <imode> it just took out the service because all of the annotations added are mutually incompatible with eachother.
[07:45:41] <imode> fuck other people and their incompetence.
[07:46:43] <imode> I should just never ask for code reviews. in fact I think I won't from like, now on to until I die.
[07:46:52] <imode> you don't need to see anything I'm writing because frankly you'd fuck it up.
[07:54:34] <companion_cube> can you go back to the review and say "hey how about no" and revert the lombok change? :p
[07:55:22] <imode> I'm about to.

[07:59:42] <imode> a field that was marked as non-null skipped past a null check.

[12:41:25] <epilys> beautiful
[12:42:20] <riv> my scrooge situation has moved from "it's still novemenber" to "there's nothing about christmas to look forward to"
[12:42:31] <epilys> my crazy old lady neighbour keeps me awake every night because she put her radio right next to my bedroom wall on purpose on the highest volume
[12:43:13] <epilys> this started after I asked her nicely to turn it down one day, after that she moved it closer and does it everynight whereas before I told her it was less frequent
[12:43:27] <epilys> I even bang at her floor and door and she ignores me and turns the volume up
[12:43:36] <epilys> cops come in, she doesn't answer the door
[12:43:37] <riv> damn i hate when people are like that, wtf
[12:43:39] <epilys> what can I do?
[12:44:32] <epilys> I was thinking of putting an fm transmitter on high power but my apartment is full of electronics and I'd have to move all of them to the other side  for them to be safe
[12:45:01] <epilys> but also, she might be listening to digital radio so that wouldn't work
[12:45:24] <epilys> if I blast an AM signal on high power?
[12:46:23] <epilys> the sad thing is I was always super nice to her, always helped her with her groceries and moving stuff up the stairs. once I asked her nicely to turn it down she stopped coming out of her apartment and does this everyday
[12:47:25] <epilys> I know it's on purpose because the last thing she told me was "people never stay in this apartment long because of the noise" and she was laughing
[13:07:52] <kline> epilys, i dont know what you know about radios but you definitely dont need to shield your personal electronics much to protect them from enough to disrupt an FM radio
[13:09:07] <kline> the FM capture effect means an FM radio will only demodulate the strongest signal, so you could probably wipe it with a handheld walkie talkie, should it have been downtuned into the broadcast FM range (88-108MHz, most handhelds are like 144MHz)
[13:09:28] <kline> handhelds are like 5W
[13:10:33] <kline> if you had a 6dB gain yagi antenna (the little spikey rack on a stick you see on houses) you can focus the energy to be 20W effective power and also because its directed less would be in your home
[13:11:08] <kline> but anyway, if you want to play at naughtiness youd be surprised how little power you need if everything is correctly tuned
[13:13:01] <epilys> kline, interesting, I already have a walkie being shipped on the way here
[13:13:18] <epilys> but it's 136MHz minimum
[13:20:41] <epilys> It's probably the best solution at this point, going through the legal processes would be incredibly expensive and slow
[13:20:49] <epilys> and right now I can't sleep every night
[13:32:46] <kline> well, if youre handy with electronics the easiest thing to do, though obviously ILLEGAL would be to make a little 5W FM transmitter
[13:32:51] <kline> if, of course, its FM radio
[13:33:01] <kline> no good if its AM of course, and vice versa
[13:48:57] <epilys> wouldn't AM with high enough power get picked up by everything more or less?
[13:49:00] <epilys> speakers etc

[14:12:14] <kline> well, yes
[14:12:24] <kline> but at that point its just because its induction
[14:13:14] <kline> radios are really really good at picking very weak signals and boosting them nicely, this is why its easy to jam them
[14:13:24] <kline> but it requires you to tune
[14:13:58] <kline> just blasting out a massive AC field and inducing noise in every run of cable is an option but a very wasteful one
[14:14:11] <kline> judo vs sledgehammer
[14:20:57] <edk> well there's a difference between massive ac field and massive radio wave
[14:21:18] <edk> in that mostly-magnetic fields have unavoidable cubic falloff
[14:21:48] <kline> oh yeah, actual AM broadcast frequency wouldnt be all that useful
[14:22:35] <kline> but induced currents is what is being alluded to if its getting picked up by speakers etc
[14:22:45] <edk> oh, yeah
[14:23:07] <edk> transmitting noise all over the AM spectrum would work to jam it, but very expensive in terms of power
[14:23:10] <riv> cubic falloff? how come?
[14:23:21] <edk> it's a dipole field
[14:24:04] <riv> amazing, I didn't know about this
[14:25:20] <edk> technically it's inverse square near to a pole, and only inverse cube a long way away
[14:25:46] <edk> but in practice, unless you're a planet, magnetic fields are always very small relative to radio transmission distances
[14:26:03] <epilys> how expensive? like running an A/C?
[14:28:38] <kline> do you actually know whether she is listening to AM or FM?
[14:29:06] <epilys> i said above, it's either FM or digital radio (through the television)
[14:29:40] <kline> just blasting energy at it isnt going to be effective
[14:29:44] <kline> youll want to actually jam
[14:30:07] <edk> noise will actually jam! just very inefficiently
[14:30:18] <edk> but you can't jam efficiently if you don't know what frequency to do
[14:30:29] <edk> anyway, attacking people with radio is almost certainly illegal
[14:31:30] <epilys> indeed
[14:32:01] <epilys> also blasting the radio at highest volume right next to the wall that borders my bedroom at 12 am - 07am is illegal
[14:33:34] <edk> well ok, find a friend, give your friend a handheld vhf radio and have them hold down the transmit button while you call the police and report a noise complaint, see where they show up first
[14:33:45] <riv> hehe
[14:33:48] <riv> race
[14:33:57] <epilys> I've called the police, filed complaints
[14:34:03] <epilys> the old lady won't answer the door
[14:34:14] <epilys> and they can't get in without a warrant or w/e
[14:34:18] <edk> i think that's sort of my point
[14:35:30] <epilys> I'm gonna tell them the old lady's place is an antifa hideout or sth
[14:36:20] <kline> edk | noise will actually jam!
[14:36:24] <riv> i wouldnt mess with the police too much
[14:36:26] <kline> yes, but power vs bandwidth etc
[14:37:10] <kline> i do think i should be a responsible staff member and suggest not swatting grandma because she cant hear her beats at a normal volume
[14:37:51] <riv> it's so cool how you lot know about radio, i wish i was doing radio stuff
[14:37:54] <edk> yeah i'd probably do the responsible thing and just buy a louder speaker and a reflector dish
[14:38:02] <riv> i soldered together a kit radio once, that was cool
[14:38:06] <kline> epilys, maybe just like constantly flood deauth packets against her wifi
[14:38:11] <kline> see who gives up first
[14:39:29] <edk> i had a friend who worked at a high power magnetics lab once. they had a line in their car park which said something like if you have a pacemaker do not cross this line
[14:40:00] <edk> they used flux compression generators which are a bit too explodey to do at home
[14:40:01] <edk> but still
[14:40:52] <riv> sheeeeesh
[14:40:58] <epilys> oh damn
[14:41:13] <epilys> I have an insulin pump on me, that'd ruin it
[14:41:19] <riv> what about putting a hose in her letterbox and putting water in?
[14:41:54] <epilys> riv, first of all, 1312, also, no letterbox
[14:42:12] <edk> i think we've drifted into suggesting ideas that are more illegal than the starting idea :S
[14:42:22] <epilys> I'm thinking of breaking her door's peephole so she can't see who's at the door
[14:42:26] <epilys> edk, haha
[14:42:33] <epilys> we're talking about a villain though

[14:43:42] <riv> interesting
[14:44:05] <riv> also if it wasn't obvious, I was joking about the hose
[14:44:06] <epilys> also as I said above, she threatened me
[14:44:18] <epilys> yeah same :^) Just joking. Not gonna do anything illegal of course.

[18:06:48] <Brekkjern> New something technology?
[18:09:29] <dimadima> that text is "New Cloud Technologies"
[18:09:48] <dimadima> on the site where you're flying through the clouds it says
[18:10:05] <dimadima> "Cloud technologies for effective work"
[18:10:44] <dimadima> looks like a russian Teams
[18:11:11] <dimadima> i just liked the serene cloud flying with '"Cloud technologies for effective work"'
[18:11:47] <dimadima> hmm it doesn't play the clouds flying reliably
[18:11:52] <dimadima> anyway
[18:12:59] <ngoldbaum> is there a russian equivalent to the cloud-to-butt plugin
[18:13:10] <ngoldbaum> someone needs to make a web3-to-butt plugin

[19:08:31] <manicennui> Looks nice, but I wonder whether they see it the way we see cookie cutter suburban homes here.
[19:09:31] <edk> i mean there's plenty of those kinds of suburbs in germany, too
[19:10:11] <manicennui> How do people view them though?
[19:10:27] <manicennui> Oh, you mean suburbs like American suburbs?
[19:10:39] <edk> yeah
[19:10:46] <gerikson> here in Sweden a suburb is called a "villamatta" - a carpet of single family homes
[19:12:33] <edk> one of the most depressing things about growing up has been seeing my friends complete the transition to being suburb people

[19:13:18] <gerikson> edk: I dunno, there are many pros to living in the suburbs
[19:13:26] <gerikson> at least on an individual levle
[19:13:32] <gerikson> like... SPACE
[19:13:43] <edk> yes they just don't include being allowed to have a soul
[19:14:19] <manicennui> edk: I think it's hard in the US. The suburbs suck, but so do our cities for the most part.
[19:14:28] <manicennui> And everything is unaffordable.
[19:15:03] <edk> yeah but the people in cities are, for the most part, fighting to survive there
[19:15:08] <edk> the suburb people are just... comfortable
[19:15:27] <gerikson> what a horrible thing to strive for...
[19:15:43] <edk> it's not that it's horrible to strive for that exactly
[19:15:56] <edk> it's just depressing to me that people settle for that life
[19:16:02] <manicennui> Most of the people I know in the suburbs have children and are miserable.
[19:16:16] <manicennui> Which is why they need all that room: to store all of the shit they buy to try to find fulfillment.
[19:16:17] <gerikson> ok what is cause and effect there manicennui :D
[19:16:45] <manicennui> gerikson: I definitely believe that children make people unhappy for the most part.
[19:16:55] <gerikson> space can be used to create areas for self-fulfillment : workshops, spaces to read/write/create...
[19:17:28] <edk> i am aware of the practical advantages of course
[19:17:30] <manicennui> gerikson: Yeah, I want space for those things, without the strip malls, ugly houses, and busy bodies.

[19:18:21] <manicennui> Historic prints make great gifts if they have some meaning to the person.
[19:18:30] <manicennui> I don't understand the crap that most people hang in their homes.
[19:18:53] <manicennui> dimadima: Damn millennials and their bannisters.
[19:19:36] <edk> do you ever wonder why photos from the 70s and 80s look so terrible
[19:20:13] <manicennui> No.
[19:20:27] <manicennui> I just assume that the automated features on cameras were not as good.
[19:20:41] <edk> they're much worse than photos from the black and white era
[19:20:56] <manicennui> Cheaper film?
[19:21:13] <manicennui> We also used Polaroids, which were never about quality.
[19:21:35] <edk> maybe. but a lot of the terrible photos i've found from that time are from trawling through... ah what's its name... NARA?
[19:22:09] <manicennui> ?
[19:22:47] <dimadima> manicennui: boomers, really
[19:22:54] <edk> ah, yes, NARA. anyway they were presumably taken by professionals
[19:22:57] <dimadima> couldn't go up and down steps like the great generation
[19:23:05] <dimadima> sorry, the greatest generation
[19:23:06] <manicennui> dimadima: It was a joke.
[19:23:11] <dimadima> manicennui: me too
[19:23:17] <manicennui> Everything that was ruined is due to millennials.
[19:23:18] <dimadima> well, i'm kind of serious :)
[19:23:27] <edk> and transferred to plates prior too quickly for any significant film degradation

[19:24:11] <manicennui> Because they already got the benefit.
[19:24:40] <manicennui> With banisters you'd want to blame Millennials for needing too much safety.
[19:26:36] <gwozniak> edk: food pictures from the 70s are some of the worst out there

[19:33:42] <riv> i like it
[19:33:43] <manicennui> Is that plantains with fish?
[19:33:43] <gwozniak> As someone born in the 70s who is a child of the 80s, I was never much one for 80s music
[19:34:16] <gwozniak> That may be because I didn't see many music videos
[19:34:20] <edk> what music were you into?
[19:35:16] <gwozniak> edk: I listened to some pop music to be sure, but my parents mostly listened to Steely Dan, Carol King, and big band jazz.
[19:36:18] <edk> interesting selection
[19:36:27] <gwozniak> I got into some thrash metal for a while and mostly ignored pop music.  Industrial, punk, electronic stuff was more my thing. When I got into music production, I started listening to pretty much everything
[19:37:24] <gwozniak> I could never get into the "hair metal" stuff, which was much more popular where I grew up. As was AC/DC

[19:41:47] <gwozniak> Yeah, best one on that album, as I recall
[19:42:04] <gwozniak> Haven't listened to that album in about 30 years
[19:43:04] <gwozniak> Classic rock (basically from the 70s) is basically stuff I don't hate, but if I never hear it again, I won't be missing out

[20:02:47] <dimadima> Generational Roles in Modern Society
[20:02:58] <manicennui> dimadima: The only real rule is to blame every generation other than your own for things you don't like.
[20:03:49] <dimadima> i don't even have a generation
[20:03:55] <manicennui> Were you not born?
[20:04:14] <dimadima> i was born in 1985
[20:04:29] <manicennui> So you are generation Z.
[20:04:31] <dimadima> i'm not gen x, i'm not a milennial
[20:04:32] <manicennui> A strawberry.
[20:04:50] <dimadima> yeah i kept hearing about gen Z but that was kind of like
[20:04:51] <manicennui> Or zoomer.
[20:04:55] <dimadima> that never happened
[20:05:00] <manicennui> What do you mean?
[20:05:02] <dimadima> i'm most certainly not a zoomer
[20:05:07] <manicennui> What do you think the X in generation X is?
[20:05:12] <dimadima> well kurt cobain killed himself all the gen x people got jobs
[20:05:15] <manicennui> Why aren't you a zoomer?
[20:05:30] <manicennui> It's just a dumb thing based on the year you were born.
[20:05:41] <dimadima> cause i'm not like 18-27
[20:05:52] <dimadima> zoomers are on zoom all day cause they're in college and stuff
[20:05:58] <dimadima> is my understanding
[20:06:01] <dimadima> i haven't taken this class yet!
[20:06:30] <manicennui> Oh, you are actually a Millennial.
[20:06:30] <dimadima> i may not even have the correct understanding of what a zoomer is i wouldn't be surprised
[20:06:34] <manicennui> Google misled me.
[20:06:41] <dimadima> that's what i was expecting you would say
[20:06:54] <dimadima> i believe i might even be an "Elder Millennial"
[20:07:03] <dimadima> gen Z got overtaken by Millennialism
[20:07:10] <dimadima> Millenarians
[20:07:21] <manicennui> Thing is, most people refer to everyone as either a millennial or boomer.
[20:07:29] <dimadima> anyway the point i'm trying to make y
[20:07:30] <dimadima> yes
[20:07:32] <manicennui> If you are young you are a millennial and if you are "old" you are a boomer.
[20:07:35] <dimadima> is that i expect life with bannisters
[20:07:40] <dimadima> making me a total weak-ass
[20:07:51] <dimadima> who can't even confidently walk down a flight of stairs
[20:07:59] <dimadima> muchless defeat the germans and the nazis and stalin
[20:08:02] <manicennui> Obviously gen x is the best though.
[20:08:20] <dimadima> gen x was height of boomerism
[20:08:32] <manicennui> Boomers were born after the war.
[20:08:34] <dimadima> (i'm speaking as though i've taken the course)
[20:08:43] <dimadima> yeah and gen x was their highest product
[20:09:20] <dimadima> gen Xers reaped the Pax Reagaeana
[20:09:23] <manicennui> Basically, boomers were born during one of the peaks of the American middle class.
[20:09:32] <dimadima> before all the industry was shipped away
[20:09:37] <manicennui> But most of them have no idea why and assume it was due to something about themselves.
[20:09:48] <manicennui> And not the fact that most of the industrialized world was in ruins.
[20:10:10] <dimadima> make boomers great again manicennui
[20:10:16] <manicennui> They were never great.
[20:10:18] <dimadima> they did it all
[20:10:24] <manicennui> They are actually the soft generation.
[20:10:28] <manicennui> They had it easy as fuck.
[20:10:57] <dimadima> white bread and cans of carnation evaporated milk
[20:11:09] <manicennui> And then when the rest of the world recovered, they were in positions of power and fucked the rest of us to stay on top.
[20:11:26] <manicennui> Because they have no idea how to actually compete.
[20:11:43] <dimadima> boomers. rule.
[20:12:12] <dimadima> i don't know
[20:12:22] <dimadima> jokes aside i don't subscribe to the boomer hate
[20:12:27] <manicennui> Eh.
[20:12:30] <manicennui> It's all shit talk.
[20:12:39] <manicennui> But they really did have it good.
[20:12:49] <manicennui> Not that every last one of them had a good life.
[20:12:49] <dimadima> a lot of people seem take it seriously
[20:12:56] <manicennui> It's what we do.
[20:13:01] <dimadima> eh i mean they didn't have it bad
[20:13:02] <manicennui> Gotta put other people down.
[20:13:14] <manicennui> Easiest if you put them in a category and put the entire category down.
[20:13:25] <dimadima> yeah
[20:13:37] <dimadima> who has it good
[20:13:38] <manicennui> dimadima: The US really did have a huge advantage of the war.
[20:13:41] <dimadima> no one has it good
[20:13:43] <manicennui> after the war
[20:13:47] <dimadima> it's just about how not bad you have it
[20:13:51] <dimadima> life is hard and you get sick and you die
[20:13:54] <gwozniak> Tribalism is a human trait
[20:13:58] <manicennui> They enjoyed a golden age for the middle class.
[20:14:03] <gwozniak> Indeed
[20:14:24] <dimadima> i'd like to see one of those borscht belt resorts
[20:14:30] <dimadima> that must have been a scene
[20:14:36] <dimadima> or old vegas
[20:14:48] <dimadima> 50s-eary 70s vegas
[20:16:04] <manicennui> The worst thing that happened to them was Vietnam. That was kind of the end of the golden days.
[20:16:28] <manicennui> By the 70s we were having problems and then in the 80s we put assholes in charge who just fucked us all to remain on top.
[20:17:18] <edk> i think it's objectively true that the boomers (and to some extent generation x, at least over here) enjoyed much better economic conditions
[20:18:10] <manicennui> Of course all of this is from the perspective of white people.
[20:18:33] <manicennui> Black people were shit on for most of the 20th century.
[20:19:11] <drakonis> https://emacsconf.org/2021/talks/nyxt/ heck yeah baby
[20:19:11] <buttsbot> EmacsConf - 2021 - talks -  Emacs with Nyxt: extend your editor with the power of a Lisp browser
[20:19:13] <edk> yeah but they're still being shit on now
[20:19:30] <dimadima> everyone says that "i think it's objectively true that the boomers ... enjoyed much better economic conditions"
[20:19:40] <dimadima> they lived a lot simpler it seems
[20:19:47] <edk> it wasn't how they lived
[20:19:53] <dimadima> look at that early boomer house in 1942 -- no bannisters
[20:20:08] <edk> no avocado toast either no doubt
[20:20:14] <manicennui> No seatbelts either.
[20:20:21] <manicennui> Boomer STRONK.
[20:20:23] <edk> seriously though
[20:20:39] <edk> the difference is they could afford to buy houses
[20:20:41] <dimadima> (i think they may have had avocado toast in many places)
[20:20:55] <edk> it was a joke
[20:20:55] <dimadima> their houses were much simpler
[20:21:21] <dimadima> if we built boomer houses and people didn't think those houses were beneath them
[20:21:30] <edk> some politician somewhere famously blamed the economic difficulties faced by young people today on too much avocado toast
[20:21:37] <manicennui> edk: They could afford to buy houses, pay off student debt, buy cars, etc. while working blue collar jobs.
[20:21:41] <edk> yeah
[20:21:43] <edk> i think most people would take what they could get
[20:21:43] <dimadima> well that guy is a dumbass
[20:21:50] <edk> i mean he's basically you
[20:22:04] <dimadima> these days even student housing is all ganite this lxuery that
[20:22:12] <dimadima> i'm just saying that's not something you can or should furnish to the masses
[20:22:16] <dimadima> it
[20:22:25] <dimadima> it's not sustainable
[20:22:36] <dimadima> is it?
[20:22:50] <manicennui> I support more one story ranches, but not even crappy condos are affordable these days.
[20:23:08] <manicennui> Most people do not have granite countertops, etc.
[20:23:12] <edk> i think you're seriously misreading the problem
[20:23:19] <edk> the space is the expensive part
[20:23:20] <manicennui> Nothing is affordable unless you live somewhere with no jobs.
[20:23:38] <dimadima> manicennui: most places for sale are ganite counters and appliances like 50% larger than those in the avg 50s home
[20:23:46] <manicennui> Nah.
[20:23:48] <edk> houses may have more granite countertops on average, but that's because granite countertops represent a much smaller proportion of the overall cost
[20:23:53] <edk> (but i don't think they do)
[20:23:57] <dimadima> edk: yes i was going to say that
[20:24:05] <manicennui> I mean, average appliance size might have increased, but most houses for sale are not nice.
[20:24:09] <dimadima> obviously the huge difference in affordability isn't in the countertops
[20:24:40] <dimadima> i wasn't around in the 1950s but it seems to me like there's a stagnation of sorts going on
[20:24:49] <manicennui> The problem isn't luxury finishes.
[20:25:02] <dimadima> well people stopped building as much, i think
[20:25:06] <edk> yes
[20:25:16] <manicennui> Far too many homes are owned by companies as investments.
[20:25:17] <edk> if i were to buy here it would cost me over a million just for the empty space
[20:25:20] <dimadima> people complain about new york / SF being expensive? why not build and live in another place?
[20:25:22] <edk> which, i mean, isn't gonna happen
[20:25:41] <manicennui> We should tax the fuck out of non-primary residences.
[20:25:42] <dimadima> ^ and my above statement is probably naive
[20:25:49] <edk> but if it did happen, spending another 50k on luxury interior furnishing wouldn't exactly change the equation
[20:25:56] <dimadima> edk: yes
[20:26:49] <edk> people live in those places because that's where they can get work
[20:27:46] <dimadima> i guess
[20:28:05] <manicennui> We are in the situation we are in because we are more concerned about people with capital making money than we are about taking care of our citizens.
[20:28:06] <manicennui> Period.
[20:29:22] <manicennui> All of the arguments against the fixes for housing problems boil down to developers or landlords not making enough money, or somehow impacting the value of some people's homes.
[20:29:53] <edk> the last one is a serious problem though
[20:30:12] <manicennui> edk: Only because of the idiotic idea that housing is an investment instead of a necessity.
[20:30:37] <edk> that's something people have been pushed into by banks and monetary policy
[20:30:41] <companion_cube> makes me so mad
[20:30:41] <manicennui> But I'm not talking about the average middle aged family worried that they will be upset down on their mortgage.
[20:30:58] <manicennui> I'm talking about affluent neighborhoods not wanting "undesirables".
[20:31:13] <manicennui> middle class family
[20:31:19] <edk> you can't just incentivise your population to make their house their primary appreciating asset then fuck them with massive negative equity
[20:31:27] <manicennui> Sure.
[20:31:32] <manicennui> It would be hard to transition to a sane system.
[20:31:36] <edk> yeah

[20:31:44] <buttsbot> Twitter - chrisjacksonsc - Come with me, and you‚Äôll see, a world of OSHA violations.. https://t.co/FDXakRiNrB
[20:31:51] <manicennui> I think it would require massive taxes on non-primary residences along with programs to help people who get fucked by such a change.
[20:32:42] <edk> yes
[20:32:58] <manicennui> Not landlords and developers, but people who are somehow impacted on their primary residence.
[20:33:02] <edk> unfortunately this will involve the government handling vast amounts of money
[20:33:16] <edk> which means conservatives will stop you from doing it
[20:33:21] <manicennui> The increased taxes could fund most of these programs.
[20:33:30] <edk> taxes bad!
[20:33:38] <manicennui> Of course. Republicans enjoy making money from human suffering.
[20:34:05] <manicennui> We already saw some of their bad arguments during the pandemic.
[20:34:08] <ngoldbaum> for anyone who doesn‚Äôt click twitter links readily: a scissor lift on an improvised raft in an olympic swimming pool
[20:34:20] <manicennui> "Look at this poor landlord who is struggling to make money on his 25 properties!"
[20:34:59] <manicennui> "He needs to be able to kick families out!"
[20:37:14] <hoistbypetard> hey Xe : what is generating things like " A 35 minute read. " at the top of your blog posts? If it's not just saying that to be silly, it seems miscalibrated. (e.g. reading leisurely, https://christine.website/blog/nixos-vr-hell-2021-12-02 was not in that ballpark for me, and i don't think i am an especially fast reader.)
[20:38:36] <dimadima> those you gotta just always write "5 min read"
[20:38:58] <dimadima> like how at the restaurant the wait is always 5 to 10 minutes
[20:39:29] <dimadima> manicennui: there was that republican judge in PA who was being bribed by the prison industry to send people to prison
[20:39:46] <manicennui> dimadima: I think there have been a few situations like that.
[20:40:05] <manicennui> I don't know whether they were all Republicans, but those situations make me reconsider my stance on the death penalty.
[20:40:06] <companion_cube> manicennui: but don't worry , they care about fetuses
[20:40:07] <dimadima> https://apnews.com/article/pandemics-pennsylvania-coronavirus-pandemic-wilkes-barre-courts-73983471fb75311725e31e2c1955e095
[20:40:35] <dimadima> manicennui: i was going to say
[20:40:49] <dimadima> back in the 1600s and 1700s people just got beheaded in public
[20:41:01] <dimadima> seems fair if you're sending kids to jail for money
[20:41:20] <manicennui> I think crimes committed by law enforcement, people in the judiciary, and politicians should be considered far, far worse than other crimes.
[20:41:36] <dimadima> yeah
[20:41:40] <manicennui> Instead it is generally the opposite.
[20:41:43] <epilys> hoistbypetard, average reading time (wpm) probably
[20:41:46] <dimadima> also weird that prosecutors exist
[20:41:53] <dimadima> never really understood that one
[20:41:58] <manicennui> What do you mean?
[20:42:02] <dimadima> i understand the state needs lawyers
[20:42:13] <Xe> hoistbypetard: https://github.com/Xe/site/blob/main/src/post/mod.rs#L115-L122 it's kinda pessimistic and the number is totally an estimate
[20:42:14] <buttsbot> site/mod.rs at main ¬∑ Xe/site ¬∑ GitHub
[20:42:20] <dimadima> but why is there a class of state-proscribed lawyers whose job it is to go after people and put them in jail
[20:42:25] <Xe> it assumes the average reading speed, etc
[20:42:26] <dimadima> kind of like, a-priori
[20:42:38] <dimadima> i get that we know crimes WILL be committted
[20:42:46] <manicennui> What is the alternative?
[20:42:48] <dimadima> but it's weird to align a person's incentives with how many people they PROSECUTE
[20:42:53] <Xe> also it's kinda miscalibrated because it will treat inline HTML segments as words lol
[20:43:08] <Xe> but as far as estimates go, it's fine as is, i want it to be much more on the pessimist side
[20:43:29] <companion_cube> a FIVE MONTHS READ?
[20:43:34] <dimadima> lol
[20:43:39] <Brekkjern> dimadima: I can't speak for the US system, but in Norway the police cannot send a case to court. That is done by the prosecutors when the police has finished the investigation.
[20:43:53] <dimadima> Brekkjern: yes that's how it is here too i believe
[20:44:03] <dimadima> but their role isn't just that
[20:44:12] <Brekkjern> Meaning, the prosecutor only looks at the material and says "I think I can convict based on this evidence" but they don't normally collect evidence themselves.
[20:44:15] <dimadima> they have free reign to pick things to investigate and go after
[20:44:31] <dimadima> but their job is to convict
[20:44:37] <Brekkjern> Yes
[20:44:49] <dimadima> there's somehing werid about that t ome
[20:44:52] <dimadima> that to me
[20:44:53] <Brekkjern> Their job is to optimize the courts time
[20:44:59] <hoistbypetard> Xe: cool. fair enough. it just seemed so pessimistic that i wondered.
[20:45:00] <dimadima> it's this antagonism between the government and the people
[20:45:10] <Brekkjern> There's no point in pushing cases where they are unsure or know they won't get a conviction
[20:45:12] <dimadima> built right into the system
[20:45:18] <Brekkjern> That just wastes everyones time
[20:45:41] <manicennui> I'm not sure about Norway, but in the US the people at the top of these departments is often elected.
[20:45:53] <manicennui> Meaning they choose what to prosecute based on what will get them reelected.
[20:45:53] <Brekkjern> They are not elected in Norway.
[20:46:06] <manicennui> s/is often/are often/
[20:46:29] <hoistbypetard> manicennui: which seems like a good idea in theory but often reduces to a perverse incentive in practice, IMO
[20:46:30] <manicennui> It's pretty common for them to run on being "tough on crime", which usually means tough on crimes that white people don't like.
[20:46:34] <manicennui> Like black people existing.
[20:46:43] <dimadima> yeah they're elected here and it's often a showboat political job in which you have power to investigate and incarcerate people
[20:46:53] <dimadima> yep
[20:46:53] <manicennui> Yeah, I agree that there are some bad incentives, but I don't know what the alternative is.
[20:46:59] <dimadima> me neither
[20:47:11] <dimadima> but it's a strange dynamic in my opinion
[20:47:12] <manicennui> Not having them being elected has pros and cons.
[20:47:19] <Brekkjern> Why?
[20:47:28] <dimadima> cause they make careers out of putting people in jail
[20:47:33] <manicennui> Brekkjern: Because they are not answerable to the people in theory.
[20:47:38] <dimadima> not unlike the prison industry
[20:47:43] <manicennui> But people often want stupid shit.
[20:47:49] <dimadima> the fact is that most if not all humans in the US are guilty of something
[20:47:56] <companion_cube> I can understand electing judges
[20:47:56] <Brekkjern> They are answerable to the people. The people elect the people who write laws.
[20:48:00] <companion_cube> but electing prosecutors is weird
[20:48:07] <manicennui> dimadima: I do not acknowledge your human law. I'm guilty of nothing.
[20:48:10] <Brekkjern> Prosecutors don't decide what gets people jailed.
[20:48:26] <companion_cube> manicennui: are you a sovereign citizen? :p
[20:48:34] <manicennui> companion_cube: To be clear, no.
[20:48:36] <manicennui> It was a joke.
[20:48:49] <jjuran> I will not submit to your tainted courts
[20:49:39] <imode> I also won't submit to your courted taints.
[20:49:39] <manicennui> Interestingly, the state's attorney for Cook County (elected position for the county Chicago is in) is using her discretion to not prosecute a lot of crimes in an effort to reduce racism in the system, but some of her choices seem highly questionable.
[20:49:49] <manicennui> Like not charging a bunch of people who had a shootout.
[20:49:55] <Brekkjern> :S
[20:49:58] <hoistbypetard> the way the system is tilted in practice, prosecutors come awfully close to deciding what gets people jailed or not 'round here
[20:50:20] <Brekkjern> No, the laws do. They can only present people to the court and have the court judging them
[20:50:22] <manicennui> hoistbypetard: They absolutely do.
[20:50:28] <Brekkjern> They can decide not to prosecute though
[20:50:42] <Brekkjern> Which essentially means "I like you so much that I will give you a get out of jail free card"
[20:50:48] <manicennui> They have discretion in everything from the bail they seek to whether to prosecute to sentencing.
[20:51:24] <hoistbypetard> if they choose to prosecute, you're vanishingly unlikely to win
[20:51:33] <Brekkjern> And the court decides if what the prosecution proposed is legal, and if the prosecuted is guilty of the crimes that the prosecution forwarded.
[20:51:40] <Brekkjern> hoistbypetard: That is the point.
[20:51:52] <Brekkjern> They are not supposed to toss a coin to decide.
[20:51:58] <manicennui> Brekkjern: We have grand juries in some cases who must be convinced that the prosecution can go forward.
[20:52:19] <manicennui> I don't know the rules around when they are used, and the rules almost certainly vary by city/count/state.
[20:52:20] <hoistbypetard> it' is either a sign that the prosecution is working and just really good at its job, or a sign that the system is biased in their favor
[20:52:49] <Brekkjern> I fail to see how the prosecutor is the problem because people get convicted of the charges the prosecutor presents. That sounds like good prioritation of resources to me.
[20:52:55] <hoistbypetard> the numbers put forth by the innocence project suggests that it is the latter in many places at many times
[20:53:19] <manicennui> Brekkjern: Because they are deciding based on factors other than whether the cases is solid.
[20:53:28] <Brekkjern> I agree that the system is biased, but the numbers are the symptoms and the prosecutor is likely not the cause.
[20:53:48] <hoistbypetard> the prosecutor may well be a symptom too
[20:53:53] <companion_cube> hoistbypetard: is the rate of non-conviction that low?
[20:53:55] <Brekkjern> manicennui: Again, that can only "absolve" people.
[20:54:06] <manicennui> Brekkjern: I don't follow.
[20:54:41] <manicennui> Brekkjern: Prosecutors push a lot of people into plea deals for things they aren't guilty of because most people can't afford good lawyers.
[20:54:58] <manicennui> Under threat of worse punishment if it goes to trial.
[20:55:23] <hoistbypetard> companion_cube: i can't dig up hard numbers at the moment, but this is a good (bad) read: https://www.usccr.gov/files/2020/2020-06-16-Prosecutorial-Discretion-in-Mississippi.pdf
[20:55:23] <manicennui> The justice system in the US is heavily biased toward people with money.
[20:55:41] <Brekkjern> manicennui: The prosecutor is not the judge and jury. They only decide to present the case. If the jury convicts, it was a good choice of case to present. If the jury accuits, the prosecutor likely did wrong. The only way they can be biased here is as you say to do plea deals, or by choosing to not present cases because of reasons.
[20:56:02] <Brekkjern> manicennui: So the problem is the lack of a defense lawyer for people. Not the prosecutor.
[20:56:06] <manicennui> Brekkjern: Most cases are not tried in court.
[20:56:31] <Brekkjern> Of course
[20:56:37] <Brekkjern> That's not the fault of the prosecutor.
[20:56:49] <ngoldbaum> in fact, the whole court system would collapse if they did
[20:57:14] <ngoldbaum> Brekkjern: it is if the prosecutor regularly participates in that by overcharging and offering plea deals
[20:57:33] <Brekkjern> ngoldbaum: People take the plea deals because they don't get defence lawyers.
[20:57:59] <manicennui> They get substandard defense lawyers who spend about 5 minutes on their case.
[20:58:11] <Brekkjern> Exactly
[20:58:23] <Brekkjern> That is not the fault of the prosecutrion.
[20:58:44] <manicennui> Brekkjern: The numbers are also affected by the fact that they are less likely to prosecute rich white people with connections.
[20:59:03] <ngoldbaum> it‚Äôs not the defendants fault that they‚Äôre poor either
[20:59:19] <Brekkjern> In fact, since the prosection is so "effective" at not putting cases through court and instead making plea bargains, the defense lawyers actually get 5 minutes per client rather than 1 minute...
[20:59:24] <manicennui> Brekkjern: Court cases are also not about truth seeking.
[20:59:28] <Brekkjern> I know
[20:59:54] <Brekkjern> My point is that you are attacking the wrong institution
[20:59:56] <manicennui> And the prosecutor advises the court on sentencing.
[21:00:06] <manicennui> And the jury is laymen.
[21:00:15] <Brekkjern> A corrupt prosecutor can really only prevent people from being convicted. Not the opposite.
[21:00:21] <manicennui> All of this leads to a lot of people being fucked if they go to trial.
[21:00:32] <manicennui> Brekkjern: Nah.
[21:00:45] <manicennui> Convictions don't require rock solid evidence.
[21:00:54] <manicennui> And prosecutors know this.
[21:01:02] <Brekkjern> Of course they don't. That's why you have defense lawyers to cast doubt about the case.
[21:01:13] <Brekkjern> If you have shit defense lawyers, then you don't need solid evidence.
[21:01:15] <manicennui> You can argue that they system should stop these things, but they knowingly use it to their advantage.
[21:01:32] <Brekkjern> And the only reason they can use it to their advantage is that the rest of the system sucks.
[21:01:54] <Brekkjern> You are complaining about the only part of the system that is actually effective, even if it is biased.
[21:01:56] <manicennui> But again, the vast majority of the problem is plea deals.
[21:02:07] <ngoldbaum> but what if a lawyer who will actually look into the case is beyond the defedant‚Äôs means?
[21:02:13] <Brekkjern> Which would not be a problem if defendants got proper lawyers.
[21:02:13] <hoistbypetard> a corrupt prosecutor in the US can also influence the police and limit the discovery abilities of an overworked defense attorney
[21:02:17] <manicennui> Also not sure about Norway, but cops can just lie to people in the US.
[21:02:23] <ngoldbaum> why should they have less justice because they can‚Äôy afford a lawyer?
[21:02:29] <manicennui> And prosecutors basically do too.
[21:02:41] <ngoldbaum> prosecutors live in that system and have a lot of power over it
[21:02:45] <ngoldbaum> the defendants don‚Äôt
[21:02:47] <Brekkjern> manicennui: Police can always lie, but they cannot provide false evidence.
[21:02:58] <manicennui> In court sure.
[21:03:00] <ngoldbaum> ‚Äúprosecutorial discretion‚Äù is a thing
[21:03:04] <manicennui> But again, most of these cases aren't making it to court.
[21:03:11] <Brekkjern> Which is the problem
[21:03:13] <manicennui> They can absolutely use fake "evidence" in interrogations.
[21:03:14] <hoistbypetard> they can if the corrupt prosecutors don't prosecute them for providing that false evidence
[21:03:15] <ngoldbaum> that should be informed by the actual reality of the system as it is
[21:03:40] <hoistbypetard> and the corrupt prosecutors don't want to go after the police for helping them keep their conviction stats high
[21:03:47] <ngoldbaum> we can‚Äôt all live in a nordic socialist society unfortunately :/
[21:03:48] <manicennui> We don't even require interrogations to be recorded, and having a lawyer present is not required.
[21:03:49] <Brekkjern> hoistbypetard: That would be a separate branch of the Norwegian legal system that prosecutes false evidence.
[21:04:00] <hoistbypetard> ah. nice
[21:04:13] <jjuran> ngoldbaum: Thanks for the summary!
[21:04:14] <Brekkjern> hoistbypetard: And that branch is fucking hated by the Police on the ground
[21:04:20] <manicennui> Cops trick a lot of people into incriminate themselves.
[21:04:30] <Brekkjern> manicennui: That is their job
[21:04:31] <companion_cube> manicennui: you can't request to have a lawyer for interrogation?
[21:04:36] <ngoldbaum> jjuran: huh?
[21:04:45] <manicennui> companion_cube: You can, but it should be required.
[21:04:47] <hoistbypetard> the fifth amendment says we can't compel them to incriminate themselves
[21:04:47] <jjuran> About the scissor lift
[21:04:49] <companion_cube> ah I see
[21:04:53] <hoistbypetard> not that we can't trick them into it
[21:04:56] <companion_cube> they're gaslight you into not asking for yours
[21:04:58] <manicennui> People shouldn't be interrogated without a lawyer and it being recorded.
[21:05:04] <Brekkjern> manicennui: I agree.
[21:05:12] <manicennui> Neither of those things is required in the US.
[21:05:19] <Brekkjern> Which is a problem.
[21:05:42] <manicennui> And then you have the prosecutor come in and offer you a shitty plea deal under threat of something much worse.
[21:05:57] <Brekkjern> And you take it because you don't have a lawyer.
[21:06:13] <Brekkjern> So the problem is the lack of lawyer, not that someone gives you a shit deal.
[21:06:21] <manicennui> Even if you have a public defender, they are not often going to fight it very hard.
[21:06:36] <Brekkjern> No, public defenders are mostly there to prevent mistrials
[21:06:40] <ngoldbaum> oic
[21:06:44] <manicennui> And all of this is made worse by the fact that drugs are illegal.
[21:07:05] <manicennui> Take away drug charges and a lot of the problems in our policing and legal system go away.
[21:08:10] <hoistbypetard> that's part of the system... let's make something that lots of people want to do a legal problem instead of a health problem. that way, defense resources are spread so thin the prosecution is practically guaranteed to win.
[21:08:31] <manicennui> hoistbypetard: It gives cops a reason to do bad shit in the first place.
[21:08:45] <manicennui> A lot of the horrendous cases you hear about with no knock warrants are drug charges.
[21:09:04] <manicennui> You'd think that drugs are literally worse than Hitler.
[21:09:09] <hoistbypetard> now let's talk about civil asset forfeiture
[21:09:10] <manicennui> Based on what we do to people
[21:09:30] <companion_cube> can't wait for no known warrants for abortions
[21:09:39] <companion_cube> no knock*
[21:10:30] <hoistbypetard> companion_cube: :(
[21:10:59] <ngoldbaum> all those techies going to regret moving to austin :/
[21:11:13] <companion_cube> don't worry, it'll be nationwide soon
[21:11:17] <hoistbypetard> but hey, at least the taxes are low!!
[21:12:51] <hoistbypetard> raising a daughter in virginia, i am legitimately afraid. i think we are moving down a slope that will lead to anyone who seems pregnant and doesn't pop out a baby being scrutinized and potentially charged.
[21:13:44] <jjuran> Even people who aren't pregnant have reason to worry, about no-knock-up warrants
[21:13:51] <Xe> hoistbypetard: yeah i've done a lot of fine adjustment and i think that overestimation is probably better here
[21:13:52] <companion_cube> heh
[21:14:00] <Xe> it's kinda shit but that's life lol
[21:14:26] <hoistbypetard> and i probably have the resources to keep this from causing jail time for my own daughter. because the system is not fair, and even though i don't like that, i damn sure will devote those resources to keeping her out of the klink if it ever comes to that
[21:14:42] <manicennui> Republicans would really love the ability to check everyone's genitals frequently.
[21:14:52] <Xe> hoistbypetard: honestly, move out of virginia
[21:14:57] <Xe> seriously
[21:14:58] <imode> people drunk on power typically behave like alcoholics.
[21:15:07] <imode> Xe: go one step further, move out of the US. this place sucks.
[21:15:07] <manicennui> Virginia is pretty blue these days, isn't it?
[21:15:12] <jjuran> "Let's get the government out of our lives!  And into our pants."
[21:15:23] <imode> jjuran: get out of my dreams, and into my car.
[21:15:25] <hoistbypetard> manicennui: purple-ish blue
[21:15:31] <Xe> imode: moving to another state is easier than moving to another country
[21:15:38] <hoistbypetard> Xe: totally leaning that way
[21:15:47] <imode> yeah but you don't escape the pervasive pile of shit that's propagating.
[21:16:10] <jjuran> hoistbypetard: Come to Maryland?  We're basically sane. :-)
[21:16:12] <Xe> but at least it will take longer fof it to propagate into california or whatever
[21:16:22] <imode> come up west. we're not total shit.
[21:16:23] <manicennui> I really think we should consider allowing the states between and including Texas and Florida to form their own shithole country.
[21:16:26] <imode> northwest, rather.
[21:16:33] <imode> northeast is also pretty nice so long as you're in Maine.
[21:16:44] <Xe> manicennui: honestly i'd love that at this point lol
[21:16:49] <imode> manicennui: just saw off the rust belt.
[21:17:14] <manicennui> Then we can outsource all of our cheap manufacturing to that country.
[21:17:16] <imode> let it float off into the.. atlantic? pacific? that'd have major geographical implications if 1/4th of north america floated downward.
[21:17:35] <manicennui> I'm even okay with letting them keep the USA name.
[21:17:44] <ngoldbaum> manicennui: the R‚Äôs just took control of the VA state government in the last election
[21:17:49] <jjuran> With rising water levels, it /is/ going downward
[21:17:59] <imode> actually hold on, keep me sane: atlantic and pacific aren't actually separated, right.
[21:18:01] <hoistbypetard> jjuran: that's basically the first choice. we felt superior for a minute with you guys being stuck with Hogan, but the last election has flipped that.
[21:18:06] <imode> why the hell do we refer to them as different oceans.
[21:18:14] <jjuran> manicennui: Let them call it Real America.  We'll be the United States.
[21:18:29] <manicennui> jjuran: I want to get rid of states too.
[21:18:36] <imode> jjuran: Real True Amazing Trustworthy Wholesome America (Not Fake) (Totally Real) (Gone Wild).
[21:18:37] <manicennui> States are dumb, especially in its current configuration.
[21:19:07] <manicennui> The only thing states gets us is complicated legal compliance and some places abusing people more.
[21:20:00] <hoistbypetard> didn't they try to call it "Real America"? I have a distant memory of a politician proudly pronouncing "Rural" as "Real-Real" and declaring that the only real Americans were rural Americans.
[21:20:26] <jjuran> Sarah Palin?
[21:21:10] <hoistbypetard> That's plausible but off-the-cuff I'd have put it an election cycle or two before she rose to prominence. W maybe.

[21:21:36] <manicennui> New America can have Alaska too.
[21:21:58] <companion_cube> they can relinquish their unused vaccine doses and use the confederate flag for all I care
[21:21:58] <indigo> With the shift in attitude toward abortion in the US, I'm planning on getting a vasectomy next year...
[21:24:09] <jjuran> Fuck it, I can't find it.

[21:32:19] <hoistbypetard> it's interfering with my desire to start a company too
[21:32:52] <hoistbypetard> which i'd expect politicians to care about... maybe...
[21:35:38] <companion_cube> I wonder if lack of abortion will impact marriage/baby rates
[21:35:47] <jjuran> No, only companies that already exist are important

[21:41:25] <jjuran> And write a blog post called "Our incredible journey"
[21:41:51] <jjuran> Seems to me, the chilling effect should be on using the thing in the first place

[22:15:51] <manicennui> Very nice.
[22:16:08] <manicennui> When will they sell to Yahoo?

[22:16:37] <manicennui> heh
[22:19:39] <gerikson> like all fire-arms adjacent wiki articles that Cosmoline piece is weirdly specific
[22:21:08] <Brekkjern> The reason is pretty obvious. Gotta write instructions in a language that crayon eaters will understand.
[22:21:49] <gerikson> heh
[22:28:22] <dimadima> my wife is from a part of the united states where they pronounce crayon "cran"
[22:28:37] <Brekkjern> No offence, but do they eat them too? :P
[22:28:40] <dimadima> there's maybe a subtle "ya" there

[22:28:48] <dimadima> the little uns im sure
[22:28:53] <dimadima> lol cb
[22:30:06] <ben> i say cran for crayon i think
[22:33:15] <manicennui> Brekkjern: Is eating crayons frowned upon in Norway?
[22:33:31] <Brekkjern> manicennui: Where, except for the marines, is it not?
[22:33:58] <manicennui> Americans eat them for extra fiber.
[22:34:09] <Brekkjern> They contain fiber?
[22:34:13] <imode> aren't you an american.
[22:34:22] <imode> in which case, a quiz.
[22:34:27] <manicennui> Can you digest wax?
[22:34:33] <imode> how many crayons do you eat a day.
[22:34:57] <manicennui> Just one.

[22:38:34] <gerikson> the world might be a shithole but at least Coldplay aren't big anymore
[22:39:22] <imode> what was the hate behind them anyway.
[22:40:37] <gerikson> they were so white it hurt?
[22:40:39] <manicennui> They are way less bad than many other popular bands.
[22:40:56] <gerikson> ok sorry
[22:41:03] <gerikson> I don't like Adele either
[22:41:21] <imode> I'll take Coldplay over whatever fucking rap shit is popular these days.
[22:42:23] <manicennui> Is there any pop music that is actually good today?
[22:42:30] <ben> silk sonic
[22:42:43] <imode> rare. in the same way that there's very little rap/hip hop that's actually good today.
[22:43:17] <imode> a lot of independent stuff went to soundcloud and other sites.
[22:43:49] <bkero> Sturgeon's law still holds, what do you know
[22:44:07] <imode> yeh.
[22:44:29] <manicennui> I dont agree.
[22:44:39] <manicennui> I think there was a lot of great pop in the 70s and 80s.
[22:44:49] <manicennui> But everything today is auto-tuned tweet garbage.
[22:44:53] <manicennui> tween
[22:45:11] <Brekkjern> Man... I am bored... I should be reading for the exam, but I have no motivation and I don't really want to do anything else either...
[22:45:21] <manicennui> It's *super* formulaic and corporate.
[22:49:34] <imode> Brekkjern: join me in figuring out how to do structural validation on concatenative programs.
[22:51:08] <Brekkjern> imode: I honestly have no idea what that means...
[22:52:14] <companion_cube> manicennui: lady gaga?
[22:52:35] <manicennui> companion_cube: I can't stand her.
[22:52:55] <manicennui> She's like the zany artist for normies.
[22:53:17] <companion_cube> ah, thinking of her fashion stints?
[22:53:42] <dimadima> ben are you from missouri
[22:53:43] <manicennui> She just seems like she is trying really hard to be different, but she's just another mediocre contemporary pop arist.
[22:53:47] <manicennui> Nothing about her music is interesting.
[22:53:54] <dimadima> or arkansas
[22:54:07] <bkero> Is Lindsey Stirling considered pop? I'm not sure that's auto-tuned.
[22:54:10] <imode> Brekkjern: simple. you have two subprograms, A and B, adjoined (concatenated) together. you need to figure out whether that adjoinment is valid by validating some imposed structural rules.
[22:54:27] <ben> dimadima: nope
[22:54:32] <gwozniak> I haven't listened to any recent pop music, now that I think about it
[22:54:39] <dimadima> my wife is from st louis
[22:54:41] <dimadima> metro area
[22:54:49] <gwozniak> I don't think I know any Lady Gaga songs
[22:54:50] <dimadima> cran
[22:55:04] <dimadima> gwozniak: you must if you were around in the world before covid
[22:55:15] <manicennui> gwozniak: I couldn't name one, but I've tried to listen to her music, as well as other contemporary pop music, and it is never good.
[22:55:26] <dimadima> bad romance, million reasons
[22:55:31] <manicennui> I know its going to be bad when someone says, "Yeah, but you have to listen to *this* song".
[22:55:36] <companion_cube> I personally like it
[22:55:41] <dimadima> gaga?
[22:55:46] <companion_cube> jaja
[22:55:47] <dimadima> i like her classics
[22:55:48] <Brekkjern> imode: So you take a piece of data, and you shove it through a pipeline?
[22:56:02] <dimadima> she's pretty good
[22:56:09] <dimadima> not like these kids these days
[22:56:21] <dimadima> Brekkjern: watch where you're putting that data
[22:56:32] <bkero> You can't exist in commercial America and not have heard Poker Face a million times already
[22:56:38] <imode> Brekkjern: moreso, you validate that the structure of the pipeline is correct.
[22:56:46] <cb> for new stuff i enjoy 100 gecs
[22:56:46] <imode> that each part of it consumes the right amount and types of data.
[22:56:56] <manicennui> bkero: I haven't.
[22:57:06] <dimadima> manicennui: you haven't heard poker face?
[22:57:08] <manicennui> I'm not sure where I would hear it.
[22:57:09] <bkero> That's difficult to believe.
[22:57:12] <dimadima> good south park too
[22:57:15] <bkero> In a grocery store.
[22:57:24] <manicennui> dimadima: I just listened to it on YT to remind myself. I don't recall it, and it is garbage.
[22:57:25] <bkero> Or a restaurant. Or clothing store. Or mall. Or on the train.
[22:57:29] <dimadima> i heard million reasons and bad romance in grocery stores a a lot
[22:57:35] <manicennui> On the train?
[22:57:40] <gwozniak> I didn't know Poker Face was her song, but yes, I've heard it
[22:57:41] <manicennui> Your trains have music?
[22:57:42] <bkero> People are assholes.
[22:57:44] <dimadima> manicennui: it's the greatest song i am offended
[22:57:49] <manicennui> dimadima: Good!
[22:58:05] <dimadima> boo
[22:58:12] <dimadima> i'm hurt, now, too
[22:58:25] <dimadima> that's a joke i'm not hurt
[22:58:26] <manicennui> We had Madonna, Cyndi Lauper, Pat Benatar, Janet Jackson, Cher, Whitney Houston...
[22:58:31] <gwozniak> I'm of the opinion that a lot of pop in the 80s sucked too, but hey, that's the joy of music opinions
[22:58:34] <dimadima> they all suck
[22:58:41] <manicennui> gwozniak: A lot of it did suck.
[22:58:54] <dimadima> okay i'm still joking but you know whos 'the worse out of those?
[22:58:55] <dimadima> cher
[22:58:56] <manicennui> gwozniak: But a lot of it was great, and a lot of it was listenable.
[22:59:00] <dimadima> i don't get cher
[22:59:04] <manicennui> Pop now is just all the same garbage.
[22:59:05] <dimadima> who neeeds share
[22:59:06] <manicennui> It's so, so bad.
[22:59:08] <gwozniak> I find it just as banal as pop today
[22:59:09] <dimadima> cher lol
[22:59:23] <companion_cube> am I supposed to believe that madonna is better than lady gaga now? :D
[22:59:23] <manicennui> gwozniak: You never enjoyed Michael Jackson?
[22:59:33] <manicennui> companion_cube: Madonna now?
[22:59:38] <manicennui> Or Madonna from the 80s?
[22:59:43] <dimadima> manicennui: we've already discussed how i've never particularly fancied michael jackson
[22:59:50] <companion_cube> whichever, manicennui
[22:59:56] <gwozniak> And I'm being honest.  I'm not trying to be difficult.  Most pop music is just fine in the background.  That's where I'm happy with it
[23:00:06] <manicennui> companion_cube: Madonna in the 80s is what Lady Gaga wishes she were.
[23:00:37] <dimadima> ironically being a pop star in the 2000s was much better than in the 80s, materially
[23:00:40] <dimadima> you know
[23:00:50] <dimadima> like being an athlete
[23:00:54] <gwozniak> Yeah, I listened to Micheal Jackson and he has some great songs.  But some of the pop stuff today is also just as catchy
[23:01:19] <manicennui> I don't know how you can compare anything today to people like Michael Jackson and The Beatles.
[23:01:22] <gwozniak> I mean, I don't go out of my way to listen to it, but I didn't think Poker Face, when I have heard it, is junk
[23:01:26] <manicennui> Any pop that is.
[23:01:44] <bkero> Pop these days tends to be overproduced. Some like that sound, some don't.
[23:01:56] <bkero> Music these days tends to be overproduced.
[23:01:59] <gwozniak> I think there was a Katy Perry song that was good
[23:02:05] <manicennui> gwozniak: It sounds like every single other pop song with a synth beat and auto tune.
[23:02:09] <dimadima> it's overproduced and underproduced
[23:02:18] <gwozniak> manicennui: nah, I don't agree
[23:02:21] <dimadima> it's underproduced in the sense that it's shit
[23:02:39] <bkero> That's not really what that means, but ok.
[23:04:44] <Brekkjern> I don't have the faintest idea what pop music is nowadays :P
[23:04:57] <Brekkjern> I just let Spotify suggest stuff to me, and I add the stuff I like to a playlist
[23:05:11] <bkero> Find American top 40 radio
[23:05:15] <manicennui> Pop music in the 80s still had real vocals and real instruments.
[23:05:20] <manicennui> And it wasn't the same 3 beats.
[23:05:39] <bkero> There was a lot of synth back then too
[23:05:44] <Brekkjern> manicennui: I'm not sure you would approve of my music tastes then :P
[23:05:48] <bkero> Brekkjern: https://www.americantop40.com/
[23:06:05] <bkero> Or, in particular: https://www.americantop40.com/charts/hot-ac-243/2021-11-27-november-27-2021-/
[23:06:25] <bkero> Coldplay is on there
[23:06:28] <bkero> lmao
[23:06:47] <gerikson> fucking Ed Sheeran
[23:07:19] <gwozniak> I suspect my indifference to pop music is the fact that I mostly ignore lyrics
[23:07:30] <gerikson> who the eff is Olivia Rodrigo
[23:07:38] <gerikson> gwozniak: I can't ignore 'em
[23:08:04] <gerikson> that's why I'm partial to clever wordsmiths like Elvis Costello - Aimee Mann - Lloyd Cole...
[23:08:04] <manicennui> gwozniak: Even if you ignore lyrics, the sound today is all the same, and it doesn't sound like instruments and vocals.
[23:08:15] <manicennui> It's synth and auto tune.
[23:08:29] <companion_cube> it's not necessarily auto tune‚Ä¶
[23:08:34] <manicennui> Not that you can't make great music with a synth.
[23:08:37] <gwozniak> Still disagree, but I admit to not listening to much
[23:08:39] <companion_cube> I mean, katy perry I don't particularly like, for example
[23:08:46] <companion_cube> but lady gaga can actually sing
[23:08:51] <manicennui> companion_cube: It's almost all auto tuned or some other form of correction.
[23:08:56] <companion_cube> and I used to make fun of her, but I changed my mind
[23:08:58] <gwozniak> companion_cube: as can Adele
[23:09:05] <manicennui> companion_cube: Most of her stuff is clearly auto tuned.
[23:09:09] <manicennui> It's not even a question.
[23:09:27] <manicennui> Whether she is capable of singing well is kind of irrelevant.
[23:09:42] <manicennui> I don't doubt that many artists *can* sing well.
[23:10:31] <bkero> Some are even allowed to sing well.

[23:16:23] <manicennui> companion_cube: I think you are expecting the really obvious autotune sound, but most songs these days are autotuned to make every note perfect, which changes the sound.
[23:16:36] <manicennui> I highly doubt that Lady Gaga has ever released a song that wasn't autotuned.
[23:16:57] <manicennui> But regardless, I just find her music bad.
[23:17:38] <manicennui> Wearing strange outfits and having weird videos doesn't make the music good.
[23:22:26] <companion_cube> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbRiT4TKCOE I don't hear much autotune there, for example. Maybe I'm just bad at recognizing it, ofc
[23:22:27] <buttsbot> Sinner's Prayer - YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbRiT4TKCOE
[23:22:27] <manicennui> I think it boils down to pop music being compressed into a very narrow range and being very repetitive.
[23:22:33] <manicennui> It's also all been done before, but much better.
[23:23:52] <manicennui> companion_cube: Again, autotune is not all that robotic sound.
[23:24:12] <companion_cube> no but it compresses the voice, right? that's what the guy is saying
[23:24:21] <manicennui> This song is definitely less bad overall, but not something I'd listen to on purpose.
[23:24:50] <manicennui> companion_cube: It sometimes just makes the notes too perfect.
[23:25:16] <manicennui> Which doesn't necessarily make the singing bad, but it drastically compresses what music sounds like overall.
[23:25:28] <manicennui> For a song like this it doesn't matter as much.
[23:25:32] <manicennui> Think about something like Queen.
[23:26:15] <manicennui> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7aDN3oujXI
[23:26:15] <buttsbot> So... YOU can't hear auto tune? No problem, NOW YOU CAN SEE IT!!! - YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7aDN3oujXI
[23:27:32] <manicennui> I think you can hear it in that example though.
[23:27:36] <manicennui> As well as see it.
[23:30:04] <companion_cube> I'd be curious to have a tool to see any song with that :)
[23:30:40] <manicennui> You can certainly buy whatever tool they are using.
[23:30:52] <manicennui> I think Rick Beato has mentioned what he uses before.
[23:31:07] <bkero> The tool is usually called Auto-tune.
[23:31:58] <manicennui> Oh, you mean a tool to autotune a song?
[23:32:08] <manicennui> I thought you meant to see the wave.
[23:32:13] <companion_cube> no, see the wave
[23:32:35] <companion_cube> probably not that trivial, you have to separate the voice from the rest?
[23:32:39] <manicennui> https://www.avid.com/pro-tools
[23:32:40] <buttsbot> Pro Tools - Music Software - Avid
[23:32:59] <manicennui> Oh, that part is harder, and probably involves obtaining the original tracks in some cases.
[23:33:20] <manicennui> But I think it can be done by hand with some help from the software.
[23:33:28] <bkero> See the wave? No. Ride Your Wave.
[23:34:03] <bkero> Autotune's original purpose was actually pretty good. But then people found out they can make aurally pleasing sounds by abusing the tool
[23:34:24] <bkero> Like a vibrato
[23:34:37] <manicennui> The studios love that they have gotten everyone use to everything sounding the same. Way easier to sell more shit to them.
[23:34:59] <gwozniak> I guess I need to listen to vocals to notice
[23:35:11] <manicennui> They don't just fix vocals.
[23:35:33] <bkero> Right. That was the tool's original purpose. But it's not typically used that way anymore.
[23:35:35] <manicennui> Plus most pop doesn't even use instruments, so the notes are already perfect.
[23:35:43] <Church> gerikson: Your nix tag comment, heh
[23:35:50] <gwozniak> Well, that's kind of the idea with synths and stuff
[23:36:03] <gerikson> Church: yeah I have too much karma
[23:36:09] <gerikson> gotta burn it off
[23:36:24] <companion_cube> so does Bj√∂rk use autotune?
[23:36:58] <manicennui> companion_cube: I haven't listened to anything she has done recently.
[23:37:05] <companion_cube> in older albums, anyawy
[23:37:19] <manicennui> Even the artists I do like tend to eventually start sounding like everyone else and doing things that don't need to be done.
[23:37:37] <gwozniak> Whatever I'm listening to has some personality and I like it.  I can't say much about modern pop music except to say I don't notice much of a difference to the obvious attempts to cash in as I did when I was younger
[23:37:48] <manicennui> companion_cube: Her old stuff came out before autotune existed.
[23:38:38] <manicennui> companion_cube: Why did you bring her up in particular?
[23:38:55] <companion_cube> just thinking of stuff I've been listening to a lot recently
[23:38:56] <manicennui> Were you just naming another artist who is far better than Lady Gaga? =P
[23:39:04] <companion_cube> blablabla
[23:39:23] <manicennui> I ask because I recently talked to some coworkers about Bjork, and none of them knew who she was.
[23:39:32] <Church> gerikson: heh
[23:39:45] <manicennui> Including a guy who listened to alternative music in the 90s.
[23:40:27] <companion_cube> I also used to really like pink floyd
[23:40:32] <companion_cube> but then it's not exactly about the singing
[23:40:33] <indigo> manicennui: Maybe they are just into Lady VueGa
[23:40:58] <manicennui> A few of them are really young and don't seem to actually be into music.
[23:41:30] <manicennui> They'll listen to DnB or something.
[23:41:48] <Church> DnB?
[23:41:52] <Church> Hold the phone
[23:42:01] <manicennui> Drum and bass
[23:42:22] <manicennui> Or Dun & Bradstreet
[23:44:10] <Church> I'm aware
[23:44:20] <Church> Was gonna link this old Brit guy who does DnB videos
[23:44:25] <Church> Can't find it now :/
[23:44:26] <manicennui> Not being into music is so odd to me, but seems to be somewhat common.
[23:44:33] <Church> Eyep
[23:47:11] <gwozniak> I just listened to Poker Face and California Girls.  Fine.  I feel the same about 80s songs like Africa, or Don't Stop Believin'
[23:47:25] <manicennui> How dare you.
[23:47:28] <manicennui> Now you've gone too far.
[23:47:38] <manicennui> We'll have no disparaging remarks about Journey.
[23:47:43] <gwozniak> Good christ Africa is such a terrible song to me
[23:47:56] <gwozniak> Journey is almost as vapid as Rush
[23:48:02] <manicennui> !!!
[23:48:06] <bkero> Whoa now
[23:48:12] <gwozniak> I always hated both of those bands
[23:48:50] <bkero> You might like prog rock, that's fine.
[23:49:03] <bkero> But you can't deny the abilities of Lee and Lifeson
[23:49:11] <manicennui> And Perry.
[23:49:21] *** Joins: jlindgren (~jlindgren@user/jlindgren)
[23:49:27] <gwozniak> Oh, they are incredible musicians.  It's too bad the music they made just grates my brain
[23:50:13] <edk> i like Africa
[23:50:18] <companion_cube> I listened to a few songs from a Madonna's album from 1983
[23:50:20] <manicennui> edk: Everyone does.
[23:50:21] <gwozniak> Honestly, I have never liked Rush.  For one thing, I notice Geddy Lee's vocals, and they just... no
[23:50:23] <companion_cube> and I was super underwhelmed :/
[23:50:25] <manicennui> Except for gwozniak
[23:50:38] <gwozniak> I don't hate the song.  I just don't find much in it I like
[23:51:05] <gwozniak> It always felt so... fake
[23:51:05] <edk> there's not much to it i guess
[23:51:10] <manicennui> It is fake.
[23:51:20] <gwozniak> Maybe that's the charm
[23:51:25] <manicennui> They even thought it was dumb after the fact.
[23:51:30] <manicennui> Lyrically.
[23:51:33] <edk> it is a bit yes
[23:51:37] <edk> (the charm)
[23:51:58] <edk> i like it because it doesn't seem cynical at all
[23:52:53] <manicennui> For everyone other than gwozniak: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_QtO0Rhp0w
[23:52:53] <buttsbot> Rush - The Spirit Of Radio - YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_QtO0Rhp0w
[23:52:54] <gwozniak> Tom Sawyer?  There's a song I hate.
[23:52:55] <manicennui> Awesome video.
[23:53:10] <manicennui> Think it was done recently.
[23:53:22] <manicennui> Song is even about an awesome topic.
[23:53:52] <bkero> Just for your insults I'm going to put on Moving Pictures.
[23:54:14] <bkero> ...right after Sunrise on the Sufferbus.
[23:57:52] <manicennui> gwozniak: I know that many people don't care for Lee's voice. I like voices that are kind of discordant.
[23:58:09] <Church> Wow, gwozniak coming in with some takes. :p
[23:58:11] <manicennui> Like Joanna Newsom
[23:58:45] <manicennui> And Jeff Mangum
[23:59:41] <manicennui> There is an album of Jeff Mangum in a coffee shop that is so so good.
[23:59:45] <gwozniak> I'm supposed to like Rush because they're Canadian, but I just can't
[23:59:53] <manicennui> But many people probably find it super grating.
