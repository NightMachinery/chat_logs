[18:50:08] <carvakaguru> My openvpn config has the "lport" directive which is getting ignored by the openvpn3 linux client. Any way I can get it to use the specified lport.

[20:45:22] <carvakaguru> Kobaz, yup there isn't much information about it at all. Seems to work fantastic though in the user space without needing to run as root. It also has DCO support which I haven't tried yet. 
[20:47:06] <carvakaguru> The logs clearly show that my lport directive is not used at all (basically ignored) - 
[20:47:15] <Kobaz> it would be great if you can reload configuration without restarting
[20:47:29] <carvakaguru> 2021-10-22 17:55:47 Client DEBUG: UNUSED OPTIONS
[20:47:30] <carvakaguru> 4 [resolv-retry] [infinite]
[20:47:30] <carvakaguru> 5 [lport] [58137]
[20:47:38] <Kobaz> like add a route or change the subnet or dns options or whatever
[20:48:17] <Kobaz> obviously if you change the cypher you'll need to restart, but meta related stuff should be able to be hot reloaded
[20:48:21] <Kobaz> like changing the CRL
[20:48:23] <Kobaz> and stuff like that
[20:49:43] <carvakaguru> Tried all that, nothing worked. It is as if the lport cannot be set when run as a user. I installed the regular openvpn 2.4 which needs to run as root and the same configuration works just fine. The lport (i.e. the source port) is honored.

[21:19:19] <f8e4_> Kobaz thank you. i have dns all default; which one do i use? how to find out
[21:21:31] <Kobaz> which one... for what?
[21:21:59] <Kobaz> your public ip will not change, you'll still have your own public ip for your own machine
[21:22:06] <Kobaz> what you probably want is redirect-gateway
[21:22:13] <Kobaz> which will push non-local traffic out through your vpn
[21:24:32] <f8e4_> Kobaz i did that + iptables masq to eth0
[21:24:46] <f8e4_> which dns server do i use now, i have none configured
[21:25:52] <Kobaz> you can use whatever dns server you want
[21:26:02] <Kobaz> typically you would use the vpn server for dns resolution
[21:27:41] <f8e4_> Kobaz by default openvpn server uses the vps dns setting. how to find out?
[21:27:50] <Kobaz> there is no default
[21:27:56] <Kobaz> it's set to use whatever you configure it to use
[22:02:29] <f8e4_> if i use a openvpn server do i need a firewall ?
[22:04:11] <xx> f8e4_: you probably need a firewall even if you don't use an openvpn server
[22:05:47] <Kobaz> heh
[22:06:47] <f8e4_> what is a firewall? guard ports. so digitalocean dorplet has one builtin right
[22:10:19] <Kobaz> not necessarily
