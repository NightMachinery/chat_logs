[00:02:08] <SurajKushwah[m]> Hemish[m]: yeah .. good for learning, I ended up writing a script.
[00:02:08] <SurajKushwah[m]> for EVERYTHING, It feel so good, to just run a script and have everything done for you instantly.

[00:02:15] <Hemish[m]> > also. . You r using these directory names get ready to change settings of browser torrent telegram
[00:02:15] <Hemish[m]> Noooo. That's what I mentioned, all the applications respect xdg-user-dirs configuration, for example qbittorrent automatically picks up "dl" directory instead of "Downloads" directory
[00:03:25] <Hemish[m]> Also telegram respected that configuration
[00:03:35] <SurajKushwah[m]> Hemish[m]: ah I just saw the screenshot, also wait a min , I never noticed this, coz I never bother installing xdg-user-dirs package, but seems like a nice idea, but nah, I have very limited tools, I configure it manually, But still good to have.
[00:03:48] <Hemish[m]> And chromium and Firefox too, all my gui file managers
[00:03:54] <Hemish[m]> All followed it
[00:07:37] <Hemish[m]> > <@telegram_803736417:t2bot.io> > <@hemish:matrix.org> Then you would surely approach this group for help, because there is a random bug in artix runit, which is not in void runit.

[14:08:16] <iamak[m]> What are the pros/cons of systemd vs other inits?
[14:10:30] <Arya[m]> systemd has wide adoption and a wide range of tool
[14:10:31] <Arya[m]> s
[14:10:45] <Arya[m]> but it has too many stuff and does  a lot of stuff on its own

[14:18:11] <iamak[m]> So basically not using systemd is like installing plain Arch. You need to manually make it usable? 
[14:18:27] <iamak[m]> Sorry I never used other inits
[14:18:36] <Arya[m]> more like lfs
[14:18:49] <Arya[m]> in terms were you need to figure out a lot of stuff 
[14:19:28] <iamak[m]> Ah cool got it
[14:20:23] <Arya[m]> atleast in my experience

[14:54:55] <Arya[m]> then what is correct
[14:55:07] <Abhi[m]> Use search engine
