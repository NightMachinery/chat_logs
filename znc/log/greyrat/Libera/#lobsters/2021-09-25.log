[01:17:51] <cot> varjag: not sure what you mean by "the manner you can slam a book together"?
[01:18:43] <af> cot: you can close an open book by slamming one half to the other
[01:18:59] <cot> But how would that translate to a browser?
[01:19:11] <cot> Like, slam a tab into another?
[01:19:13] <varjag> that's exactly the issue
[01:19:16] * cot be very confuzzled
[01:19:52] <varjag> like i open a link, see it's category theory mumbo jumbo
[01:19:53] <af> idk. fyi varjag is a hippy web designer from bay area who knows nothing except css and html4
[01:19:57] <dimadima> i'm understanding this as like to close the tab with some "umph"
[01:19:57] <varjag> if it were a book i'd slam it shut

[01:23:17] <technomancy> it has a lid; it can be slammed

[01:24:00] <technomancy> af: not with that attitude it won't
[01:24:08] <af> I guess you could add a handler to close the currently open browser tab when the lid is closed

[01:24:18] <varjag> technomancy: i like your thinking
[01:24:26] <varjag> it's clear the lid needs an accelerometer
[01:24:37] <af> and then just keep opening and closing the lid a bunch of times when you wanna close a bunch of tabs together
[01:24:37] <varjag> excess of 2g = close current document
[01:24:37] <ignaloidas> varjag, you could probably make a button that could do the same thing for a mac, but no built-in functinality I'm afraid
[01:24:41] <technomancy> maybe you can use the light sensor
[01:24:52] <technomancy> if the change in light is very sudden and corresponds to the lid sensor, that's a slam
[01:26:06] <af> technomancy: I think to be perfectly sure, we should keep the microphone on in the background and make sure that the last heard sound resembled a slam
[01:26:29] <technomancy> af: a slam which coincides with cussing ideally

[11:21:23] <daegalus> For slack, the slack puppet bridge is janky and doesn't add channels until it sees activity in them and threads work weird. For IRC it's fine, but it's too formatted/web2.0 for IRC.
[11:22:12] <daegalus> And for matrix, it's heavy and slow and is killing a i3 8th gen with 4 gigs of ram being in only 1 large channel.

[22:46:07] <riv> endless, haskell has this??
[22:46:09] <Ori_B> endless: er? haskell doesn't really do live-reloading, as far as I'm aware
[22:46:21] <companion_cube> there's erlang and the lisps, I guess
[22:46:24] <companion_cube> not sure what else
[22:46:29] <rwb> self
[22:46:50] <Ori_B> rwb: and, for erlang, there are no loops, just tail recursion.
[22:46:56] <endless> I thought that the file watch flag passed to stack build would be considered live - reloading
[22:47:03] <endless> unless I'm missing the point of what live reloading is
[22:47:10] <rwb> (actually you don't really "live-reload" in self, you are in the system as it runs so you can just replace things)
[22:47:14] <Ori_B> so you can detect that a function reloaded, so you transform your data and hand off to the new function
[22:47:36] <rwb> (and just like erlang, you can change a function *as it is running* to fix an exception and retry)
[22:47:38] <Ori_B> endless: the point is that you don't have to do things like close fds
[22:47:50] <Ori_B> or lose in memory data structures and rebuild them.
[22:47:53] <technomancy> endless: clojure, lua, erlang, elixir, forth, elisp, CL
[22:48:28] <endless> ah I see, I thought you just meant live re(building) on changes lmao
[22:48:34] <Ori_B> typically, 'in a usable way for a production environment' is the caveat, otherwise C also has this :)
[22:48:52] <rwb> zig's executable patching is also pretty cool
[22:49:01] <rwb> it reduces incremental builds to a few ms
[22:49:37] <endless> oh man I forgot about zig
[22:49:44] <c355e3b> Java can do it too
[22:49:50] <endless> are there any large non trivial things running on zig these days
[22:49:53] <technomancy> endless: pressing a single key combo after saving a file is usually not too much to ask and is  much more reliable than trying to wire up inotify
[22:50:05] <c355e3b> Define large and non-trivial
[22:50:33] <c355e3b> I have debug tools written in it which touch XX billion data points a month
[22:51:16] <endless> curious if its seems to have any adoption yet in corporations as a replacement for c
[22:51:50] <companion_cube> it seems extremely hard to do in a static language
[22:52:00] <companion_cube> since your data will not change shape appropriately anyway
[22:52:14] <technomancy> companion_cube: erlang's solution for this is brilliant
[22:52:55] <technomancy> companion_cube: when you deploy a new version of a module, you include adapter functions which can be applied to any data currently on the stack to translate from old versions of a struct to new versions, for example if you deploy a new version of a module which adds a field to a struct.
[22:53:19] <riv> common lisp has reloading
[22:53:31] <riv> lua does too
[22:53:51] <companion_cube> it works well in erlang also because all data is structural
[22:54:01] <companion_cube> atoms, tuples, maps, lists
[22:54:33] <technomancy> structs in erlang are compile-time constructs that become tuples at runtime; I imagine that can't be all that different from how many static type systems are implemented
[22:54:41] <companion_cube> in a static language typically you have tons of struct-like objects whose fields are accessed by offset; if  you change the type definitoin the old values become invalid
[22:54:51] <technomancy> that's the same as erlang, yeah
[22:54:57] <companion_cube> aren't they maps?
[22:55:09] <technomancy> no, maps are very new. when I learned erlang they didn't exist.
[22:55:15] <companion_cube> ah, I see.
[22:55:21] <companion_cube> maybe it's elixir stuff which relies on maps now, idk
[22:55:33] <companion_cube> but then an erlang module that reloads with a different definition of a struct will crash as well
[22:55:47] <endless> c355e3b do you reach for zig a lot or is it more of a hobby lang for you
[22:55:50] <companion_cube> (beats a segfault, of course, but still)
[22:56:08] <technomancy> companion_cube: yes, that's why when you write a new version of a module you can provide an upgrader function which is OldStruct -> NewStruct

[22:56:50] <companion_cube> oh that's cool, ok
[22:56:54] <companion_cube> nice
[22:57:00] <companion_cube> just like a DB migration
[22:57:03] <technomancy> any in-flight processes will keep the old version of the module around until they can call the upgrader function with whatever's on the stack, it's only at that point that the new version of the module is visible
[22:57:27] <technomancy> but every process (green thread) has its own set of modules and performs the upgrade at a different time
[23:00:22] <c355e3b> Also, you only get two versions
[23:00:27] <c355e3b> and *do not* try to downgrade
