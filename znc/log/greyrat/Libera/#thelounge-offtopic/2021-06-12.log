[04:53:28] <Snuupy> so oracle cloud free tier
[04:53:41] <Snuupy> 4 core ARM 24GB RAM 200GB disk
[04:53:49] <Snuupy> can store all thelounge logs lol
[07:26:18] <cim> wtf
[07:26:22] <cim> how can they afford that shit lol

[08:35:06] <Snuupy> cim: gigabit networking too
[08:35:14] <Snuupy> at least on the 4 core 24 ram instasnce
[08:35:24] <Snuupy> I'm checking now to see if you still get a gigabit of network if you're doing 1core
[08:35:36] <Snuupy> I don't know if wireguard can hit gigabit on a single core though with ~800 geekbench
[08:35:47] <Snuupy> or if there's AES acceleration on the chip
[08:37:31] <cim> they'll probably pull a google photos, advertise unlimited picture/video storage but then pull the plug eventually
[08:39:29] <Snuupy> I wouldn't be surprised
[08:39:39] <Snuupy> it's been going on for a year now
[08:39:44] <Snuupy> wonder how long they'll be able to keep it up
[08:39:58] <Snuupy> maybe by then I'll have moved into a location with gigabit networking and I can rely on my own hardware

[10:00:17] <shadoozo> They upped the free thing or something?
[10:00:33] <shadoozo> How's that free lol 
[10:11:00] <Snuupy> added
[10:11:06] <Snuupy> I got a survey from em
[10:11:13] <Snuupy> they were exploring free GPUs
[10:25:10] <Snuupy> https://lounge.services.snusite.com/uploads/a6eecda03ad481bf/image.png 
[10:25:24] <Snuupy> so 1gbps with 4 cores
[10:25:27] <Snuupy> 500mbps with 1 core
[10:25:28] <Snuupy> LOL
[10:28:00] <Snuupy> oooh you can adjust CPU + RAM while it's running
[10:28:07] <Snuupy> it'll force a reboot but you don't have to spin up an entirely new instance
[10:33:11] <Snuupy> gigabit on 2 core  https://lounge.services.snusite.com/uploads/c6c5caa3d8aae07c/image.png

[11:06:18] <Snuupy> I bet if you create 4 x 1CPU instances you can get 2gbps throughput
