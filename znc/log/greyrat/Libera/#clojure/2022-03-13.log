[13:42:45] <sobel> huh, this guy nails down timestamptz treatment *short of bitemporality* so basically addressing the issues failed by advice to "just convert to timestamptz (UTC) early and all will be fine"
[13:42:49] <sobel> https://codeblog.jonskeet.uk/2019/03/27/storing-utc-is-not-a-silver-bullet/
[13:44:00] <sobel> i think the TL/DR of it is, don't throw away local time because its spot on the UTC scale is mutable due to unanticipated changes in timezone rules
[13:45:51] <sobel> i didn't want to care so much about timestamps but it keeps being so fruitful when i least expect it
[13:47:06] <sobel> and TIL Noda Time is Joda Time for .NET
[14:10:06] <sobel> for my part, i told the HN crowd to store velocity and apply the Lorentz transformation at display time
[14:10:17] <sobel> got to track time accurately!

[17:09:23] <seabass> Hello! I've been writing an application which uses Stuart Sierra's 'Reloaded' workflow. Currently, I have the system state in an Atom, but it's proving difficult to ensure that the non-idempotent side-effects used to start and stop the system are only run once. Would anyone have suggestions on how to move forward with this - might a Var be the solution, or maybe some kind of locking mechanism?
[17:10:24] <seabass> (context: Atom's swap! function runs the start and stop functions multiple times, which leads to 'ghost' connections being created and timing out.)

[19:07:58] <Para> seabass: use either component, mount or mount-lite
[19:08:40] <Para> component is made by Stuart Sierra, so there's an obvious bridge there, but my favorite is mount. Check all three out, test them out, pick the one that suits you :)
[19:09:24] <Para> If your question is more about architecture itself, then I guess that goes a bit deeper than just choosing a library.
[19:13:17] <ridcully_> isn't the reload workflow using alter-var-root?  also swap! explicitly states, that the function must be free of side of sideeffects.  so yes, you basically can not use it
