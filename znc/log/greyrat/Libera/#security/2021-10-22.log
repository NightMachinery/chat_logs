[00:00:44] <wombawomba> So I shouldn't really be rotating my keys per se — rather I should be adding new keys over time?
[00:01:29] <piou> I guess so, most of the security models are designed with transmissions in mind (hence my use of "messages") but in your case it would mean adding new keys.
[00:01:55] <wombawomba> Got it, thanks :) Very helpful

[02:43:42] <ghostbuster> does anyone have experience with an automated tool to keep wordpress plugins up to date?
[02:44:35] <sartan> Lol, just had that wordpress plugin conversation 20 minutes ago
[02:45:05] <sartan> My recommendation would seriously be stop managing wordpress yourself, and outsource it to something like https://wpengine.com where they will handle the plugin management for you
[02:45:05] <secbot> ^ WordPress Hosting, Perfected. | WP Engine®
[02:45:07] <sartan> as a service
[02:45:18] <sartan> I did this at my last job and was able to sleep at night again
[02:45:49] <sartan> it was something like 50 bucks a month which was _way_ cheaper than operating costs to maintain all the random crap our marketing team did
[02:46:17] <ghostbuster> sartan: do they keep all plugins up to date for you?
[02:46:22] <sartan> They did, yes
[02:46:49] <sartan> it's not like wordpress.com h osting which limits the plugins, they seemed to support every plugin we were using
[02:48:43] <ghostbuster> interesting, thanks
[02:49:15] <sartan> It was very stressful to have onprem wordpress hosting as it was a constant sore spot
[02:49:23] <ghostbuster> friend's business site got some sort of malware added and the hosting co can't even say whether it was cred stuffing wp-admin or sql injection
[02:49:24] <sartan> I would write these guys a glowing review if i still could
[02:49:30] <sartan> right, _exactly_.
[02:50:15] <sartan> they also have all sorts of great reverse proxies in front of apps that can help prevent certain malware-ish patterns, as well as making your plugins/framework immutable outside of explicit user action.  Good access control in the wordpress/filesystem architecture goes a long way, where even if something 'was' exploitable it doesn't become possible to drop in new code
[02:50:46] <sam_> oh nice
[02:50:48] <sartan> iirc they had analysis tools available that detected weak permissions/user access control
[02:50:56] <sartan> 'your images folder is permitted to execute php.'
[02:51:28] <sartan> and the last final benefit on top of all the technical stuff is that _I_ no longer had to support our marketing team, wpengine took over.
[02:51:32] <sartan> And they were very good
[02:52:06] <sartan> so security was handled, plugins were updated, it was reasonably hardened, my own boxes couldn't be used against me, and the marketing guys had a much more qualified contact to help them with any WP issues they had.
[02:52:40] <sartan> https://wpengine.com/support/wp-engines-security-environment/
[02:52:40] <secbot> ^ WP Engine's Security Environment - Support Center
[02:53:02] <sartan> they specialize in wordpress as opposed to a more generic hosting provider that just gives you ftp or whatever
[02:53:57] <ghostbuster> yeah
[02:54:24] <ghostbuster> looks like the reverse proxy stuff is extra though - was that through cloudflare?

[02:57:36] <sartan> proper hardened config can go a long way too
[02:57:41] <sartan> they'll enforce it
[02:57:49] <ghostbuster> yeah i think wpengine is clearly a much more premium offering
[02:57:57] <sartan> worth every penny IMO =)
[02:58:15] <sartan> That's certainly a business decision to be made
[03:01:15] <sartan> one of the nice things that saved us is they have some software that will snapshot the visualized presentation of your site on each/every/sample (I don't remembner) pages to cache the appearance before and after the plugin updates, and if something changes it can notify you

[04:55:38] <sartan> I hate my thinkpad =( I prefer my old dell XPS 15 by many factors
[04:55:42] <sartan> Lenovo gear sucks.
[04:56:02] <sartan> screen resolution is terrible, battery life is terrible, IO options are terrible, no touch screen, the trackpad fails to register half the time.
[04:56:13] <sartan> and the lenovo is twice the cost as the dell, it makes no sense
[04:56:20] <sartan> it's heavy too

[19:12:33] <sartan> so scanning a bunch of different/24s on different customers means one license hit per discovered IP, it's really awful
[19:12:46] <sartan> I think they have a particular unlimited consulting license that can be used to avoid this time bomb
[19:12:59] <sartan> deleting the scan/report does -not- reduce your license count, as i've recently found out.
