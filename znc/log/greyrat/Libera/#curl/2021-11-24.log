[12:03:54] <bagder> #8051 is building up to become a new patience test
[12:03:55] -curelbot- [GitHub] Unknown Entity #8051: What is needed to build libcurl with SFTP support? (https://github.com/curl/curl/discussions/8051)
[12:06:50] <icing> some of us deal with customers who, asked for error logs, send Word documents.
[12:06:58] <bagder> haha
[12:07:11] <bagder> or just a screenshot of them
[12:07:18] <bagder> ... in a word document
[12:07:29] <icing> screenshots I are mostly send as excel
[12:08:13] <icing> although I got the in word almost as often. 
[12:13:41] <bagder> I wanted hyper to provide the headers to me in the same order they arrive over the wire. Their solution is to provide the entire header "blob" in a single huge buffer for me to handle. I'm having second thoughts on this approach as that then leaves me to parse that entire thing on my own and now I'm having second thoughts
[12:13:54] <bagder> seems to counter the idea of having another parser pretty good
[12:16:37] <bagder> they provide them in the network order - as long as there are no duplicate ones!
[12:17:32] <icing> bypassing Rust memory safety to do the heavy lifting in C?
[12:17:40] <bagder> right
[12:17:58] <bagder> alternatively, just use that raw buffer to "display" and let hyper parse
[12:18:07] <bagder> but still quirky
[12:18:26] <icing> and I bet they asked "why do you need this?"
[12:18:30] <bagder> of course
[12:18:41] <icing> rustsls people do the same
[12:19:22] <bagder> and I try to tell them people use curl to also debug/view HTTP and will assume it shows what comes over the wire
[12:19:36] <bagder> reordering the headers will be confusing
[12:19:54] <icing> it can waste a lot of time in bug analysis, that's for sure.
[12:20:03] <bagder> I honestly think that reorder will confuse other users of theirs too
[12:20:17] <bagder> its so arbitrary
[12:20:38] <bagder> only if there's a duplicate header they move that second header to come immediately after the first
[12:24:07] <icing> in rustls, they modeled the server's ALPN as a readonly property of their SSL_CTX. Since ALPN is dynamic in Apache, I have to create a separate SSL_CTX for each connection. I think I explained that at least 3 times to them in the past months. 
[12:24:46] <icing> and always: "why do *you* need that, again?"
[12:25:18] <bagder> some rivers are tougher to paddle...
[12:26:40] <icing> their 'knowledge' of how TLS works is complete. No new things can be added.
[12:26:51] <bagder> icing: do you sense any interest or "need" among peeps/community for your rustls module?
[12:27:28] <bagder> I can tell you the desire for hyper in curl seems very luke warm
[12:28:44] <icing> bagder: I have not heard of anyone using it. Josh is asking around. I wonder what replies he gets.
[12:30:35] <icing> I think most users just do their regular distro updates and, since there are always security fixes, one more or less does not really make a difference. Unless some heartbleed appears.
[12:34:43] <bagder> makes sense
[12:37:29] <bagder> I get the same feeling for hyper in curl. Some people like the idea of it. Very few care about it actually happening

[12:57:00] <bagder> but they are rare
[12:57:42] <Piru> true
[12:59:59] <Piru> heh debian bug numbers > million now.
[13:02:53] <icing> I think, in case of mod_tls, we should provide it and the distros will offer it. Then people can switch (or distros change default setup).
[13:04:04] <bagder> yeah
[13:04:05] <icing> in curl  there is no 'dynamic' switching to hyper, or?
[13:04:08] <bagder> no
[13:04:26] <bagder> the distros need to provide libcurl builds built with it
[13:04:33] <icing> so distros have a harder time to make the choice (or even more packages)

[15:14:41] <bagder> that's not really a libcurl issue is it?

[15:37:13] <bagder> wohoo, added a CI job for curl-www ! =)
[15:37:13] <Piru> I just install pyXX-curl and things just work (TM) -- just a note that this of course requires using the python from ports, not the macos one
[15:37:29] <p-i-> Not too keen on win/macOS myself. If linux ever sorts out speech recognition Ima swap.
[15:38:10] <p-i-> Piru: I haven't played with macports. Is it compatible with homebrew? I don't like the idea of having 2 package managers running, but if there's a chance of it working Ima try it out.
[15:38:27] <Piru> but say use #!/usr/bin/env python3.9 and it picks up the python3.9 from ports just fine
[15:38:59] <Piru> I don't use homebrew at all, sorry, no clue if things would interoperate in any way
[15:39:40] <p-i-> oh gee another Python manager. I've already got anaconda and pyenv (as well as native virtualenv stuff).
