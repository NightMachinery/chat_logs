[00:04:44] <otisolsen70> Ah. Looks nice. As I understand the docs, I just need to set max_replication_slots to a value > number of concurrent slaves for this to work? I see that default is 10. So that should already be in effect?

[02:03:44] <felx> Hi, I'm looking for ways to call expensive computations per row from complex sql queries. Expensive means ~1s per row, so I don't want to execute it in the db server. Just calling an exernal service with plpython works, but these calls are executed sequentially, which takes a lot of time. Let's assume, my computation service can handle arbitrarily many concurrent calls. How would I approach this?
[02:04:38] <fcr> by writing an external REST service in charge of doing these calls instead of calling from the postgresql backend
[02:05:08] <fcr> if you really need to do it from the backend I guess you could start a threadpool and then use asynchronous calls
[02:05:33] *** Joins: rpkilby (~rpkilby@c-24-20-208-106.hsd1.or.comcast.net)
[02:06:41] <felx> The thing is that postgres knows best which calls to make, especially when the queries are complex. Replicating that logic in my backend sounds like a bad idea.
[02:07:15] <fcr> calling an external service from plpython is certainly a badder idea :)
[02:07:32] <felx> Why is it a bad idea?

[02:09:00] <felx> My goal is to go a bit further and put expression indexes on some of these expensive calls.
[02:09:05] <fcr> there are several arguments, one is security: in a properly secured environment your database server will not have access for establishing connections (except maybe replicas and stuff like that)
[02:10:20] <fcr> second, cohesion: a database should only be doing database-y stuff, like storing data and providing access to it

[02:11:38] <fcr> third, database workers are relatively expensive, having a db process alive making queries to other systems means wasting those precious resources
[02:12:15] <fcr> fourth, security once again, if you get OOMd because of let's say a large payload, that will kill your DB worker and it's not nice

[02:13:51] <fcr> fifth, cleanliness in your architecture: no sane devop would expect calls from a database to an external service
[02:14:14] <felx> Ok, thank you, I understand. So even for a complex query with joins, group by, etc that needs computation results, you suggest that I replicate that query logic in my backend to decide which functions to call?
[02:14:44] <felx> The database would give me that logic for free
[02:14:56] <fcr> but hey, it's fun if you are just doing it just for learning or hacking (as in trying to reach the limits of a tool)
[02:15:28] <fcr> that's why I suggest to use asynchronous calls, so that you can make them in parallel
[02:16:03] <felx> Unfortunately not only for fun :), It should become a product at some point
[02:16:59] <felx> async calls from the backend or the db, you mean?
[02:17:16] <felx> can I do async calls from the database?

[02:21:37] <fcr> then I would suggest trying to think another way to do it, and if you REALLY MUST, then yes, just create a thread pool inside the db (in plpython) and use async calls from the there

[02:23:58] <felx> Yes, I'm trying to look for alternative ideas, that's why I'm asking here :). I don't really see, how I can do the calls in the backend without full access to the data and a query planner. Example: select a,b, expensive_func(a,b) as c from mytable order by c limit 100
[02:25:24] <felx> As far, as I understand, I REALLY MUST do it in the db, if I want to protect myself writing a query parser and planner that can run in the backend.

[03:20:40] <raptelan> The docs state regarding SELECT privelege, "For sequences, this privilege also allows use of the currval function. For large objects, this privilege allows the object to be read." - yet when I grant this to a user and try to use currval, I get:  ERROR:  currval of sequence "acl_role_id_seq" is not yet defined in this session
[03:20:52] <raptelan> I am able to select * from the sequence though.
[03:22:35] <peerce> lastval() is only valid after a nextval() has been made in the same session.
[03:22:50] <raptelan> yeah, I know, but the docs are misleading.
[03:22:56] <peerce> same with currval(sequencename)
[03:23:02] <peerce> https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-sequence.html
[03:23:09] <peerce> read the description of currval(*)
[03:23:38] <raptelan> Granting select on a sequence without usage makes currval useless as it can only produce an error since nextval cannot be called.
[03:24:08] <raptelan> The bit I quoted is from https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-priv.html
[03:25:12] <raptelan> I'm wondering what the point is of saying "this enables currval to be used" when it only enables it to throw an error, unless usage is also granted.
[03:25:38] <peerce> if you have usage WITHOUT select, then you can nextval() but not currval()
[03:25:51] <peerce> not very useful but thats how it works.
[03:26:40] <raptelan> Not according to the docs - they say under USAGE:  "For sequences, allows use of the currval and nextval functions."

[03:34:54] <raptelan> Being owned by a table doen't handle permissions needed by things like SERIAL and GENERATED ALWAYS BY SEQUENCE for a user who is granted insert on the table.  Of course if you don't use permissions within the database and just have a single app user that owns everything it doesn't matter.
[03:35:28] <raptelan> I'm setting up group roles to handle permissions in a fairly fine-grained manner.
[03:36:14] <raptelan> read-only users should only get select when it comes to sequences.  But for them currval, which the docs specify gets enabled, is useless. :P
[03:36:58] <raptelan> anyways no big deal, just thought maybe it would be worth making a tweak to the docs for clarity.
[03:37:24] <peerce> the problem with using lots of roles is, that model doesn't play well with connection pooling, and busy web or appservers pretty much need to use connection pooling to optimize and manage the total number of actual concurrent database operations
[03:38:05] <peerce> and hardly anyone has end user 'desktop' sort of apps connecting directly to the database anymore.  that was more of an 1980s programming model
[03:39:29] <raptelan> Well, it can be managed with a bunch of small pools, though yes it gets more complex and more connections are needed overall.  My employer has a couple hundred microservices and wants a separate user and permissions for each one.
[03:39:54] <peerce> yeah, that won't perform well under high workloads.
[03:40:15] <raptelan> Plus they use a separate user for every employee who has database access, and different people get different privileges
[03:40:17] <peerce> like, if you have a say a 32 core database server, doing more than around 64 concurrent transactions will actually slow down the total transaction/second
[03:41:45] <raptelan> That really depends on what the transactions are doing and what resources they need.  I have heard that before, tried to prove that and failed.  A fair bit more than 2 processes per core can be used without any performance impact, assuming the transactions are simple.
[03:42:35] <raptelan> or maybe it's more a matter of where the bottleneck is, *shrug*
[03:43:04] <peerce> 100s and 100s of concurrent operations are far more likely to trip up on locks and such
[03:43:29] *** Quits: Klinda (~superleag@user/klinda) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[03:44:19] <raptelan> Previous employer liked to scale up their app nodes to dozens or hundreds thinking it would somehow make things better, and then either have so many connections that pgbouncer on the database node would fail due to being single-threaded and running out of CPU, or the linux networking stack running out of TCP connections.
[03:44:53] <raptelan> Or with pooling on the app nodes, when they'd get up to a huge number of app nodes it would be too many connections even with a small pool size per app node.
[03:46:04] <raptelan> it's kind of a sad day when you have to have app-side *and* database-side pooling just to keep a service up.
[03:46:11] <raptelan> But all the rage these days is autoscaling with kubernetes.
[03:46:28] <peerce> that works great for stateless web/appservice stuff
[03:46:34] <peerce> not so great for stateful stuff like databases.
[03:46:56] <raptelan> not when every stateless app node wants 20 connections and they scale up to 200 nodes :P
[03:47:34] <peerce> run the pool on the database server itself, so all the appservers share the same pool.
[03:47:42] <raptelan> and it's an app that wants to use a new connection for every. single. query.  Then of course it's always a database problem. :P

[03:48:53] <raptelan> peerce: yeah, like I said that falls apart when there's too many connections as pgbouncer at least is single-threaded.  We ran out of CPU doing that without any app-side pooling as well, or another time exhausted the linux tcp connection limit (something like 32k connections I think)

[03:49:53] <raptelan> It never ceases to amaze me how badly software can be developed.
[03:49:58] <peerce> well, 32000 postgers connection sis gonna blow up too.
[03:50:20] <peerce> we used a pub/sub messaging queuing system to interconnect our work nodes
[03:50:42] <peerce> so we could tune the number of worker nodes for a given database server to whatever provided optimal throughput
[03:51:18] *** Quits: hoppity_ (~hoppity@mobile-166-172-56-167.mycingular.net) (Remote host closed the connection)
[03:51:23] <raptelan> a per-app-node pool of modest size that then connects to a shared db-side pgbouncer works pretty well, but then it's possible for some app nodes to hog the connections while others are stuck waiting in the queue.  Depends on how well load is actually balanced between the app nodes.
[03:53:09] <raptelan> when an app has some api calls that take only a few ms and others that take a couple minutes, holding database connections open while some slow network api call is being done, a load balancer can't exactly keep things evenly-balanced.
[03:53:55] <peerce> yeah, we had our workloads clearly deliminated between OLTP and OLAP operations, OLAP ran on entirely different database servers
[03:54:20] <peerce> OLAP was used for reporting, analysis, dashboards
[03:54:34] <peerce> OLTP for manufacturing operation transactions (this was all factory stuff)
[03:57:02] <peerce> in fact, we had a special 'rollup' server type that ran in parallel to the general adhoc OLAP server,  the rollup server did time sequence aggregation, 1000s of different attributes by teh hour, by the shift, by day, by week
[03:57:34] <peerce> and that quickly became so popular by the operations dashboard people they ended up running a half dozen rollup servers, each for a different batch of attributes

[15:24:09] <teresko> hi everyones
[15:24:22] <teresko> what are the latest recommended tools for SQL migrations?
[15:28:15] <grove> I think that depends a lot on the specifics, like from whic SQL-implementation (postgres is a possible answer) are you migrating to postgres (I'm assuming, if this is to be on-topic)

[15:43:53] <strk> what's         ProjectSet  in explain output ?
[15:43:56] <strk> I have:         ProjectSet  (cost=0.42..13.58 rows=1000 width=4) (actual time=3748.871..3748.908 rows=3 loops=1)
[15:44:21] <ilmari> strk: paste it in explain.depesz.com and click the link it turns it into?
[15:45:05] <ilmari> I _think_ it's evaluating the select list, i.e. projecting the result form one set of columns to a different one, but not sure
[15:45:20] <depesz> ilmari: i don't have docs on ProjectSet
[15:45:37] <depesz> sorry

[21:02:54] <dfee> i guess i *could* repeat the query N times, or introduce a CTE to get more ergonomic data, but was wondering if i can do this without blowing up working set.
[21:10:54] <peerce> maybe just maybe that jsonb data should be in a 'real' table instead of jammed into a field.
