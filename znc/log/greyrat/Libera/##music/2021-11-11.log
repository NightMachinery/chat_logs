[00:23:19] <riff-IRC> TXDillo: Nowhereland, East Texas
[00:23:30] <riff-IRC> (AKA BFE/Potatoville)
[00:23:41] <TXDillo> Well, a lot of Cal tech people have relocated to the Austin area, but that's been going on for quite some time
[00:23:51] <TXDillo> Silicon Hills they call it
[00:24:10] <TXDillo> even Musk lives here now and has relocated Tesla HQ
[00:24:30] <riff-IRC> and aren't there quite a few silicon foundries under construction?
[00:24:38] <TXDillo> but the tech boom really started in the 90s
[00:25:07] <TXDillo> yeah, people like Samsung AMD have been here since the 90s as well
[00:25:30] <TXDillo> and Samsung is talking about a new $10B plant near Taylor
[00:25:47] <riff-IRC> yea, so we're getting hit not as hard as other areas by the chip shortage?
[00:26:04] <TXDillo> could be
[00:26:32] <TXDillo> might be another reason Tesla is building a new car plant here
[00:27:21] <TXDillo> and of course Musk has his SpaceX spaceport at Boca Chica in far south TX

[00:29:49] <TXDillo> Boca Chica (Texas) - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boca_Chica_(Texas)
[00:29:49] <Janet> ^ Boca Chica is an area on the eastern portion of a subdelta peninsula of Cameron County, at the far south of the US State of Texas along the Gulf Coast. It is bordered by the Brownsville Ship Channel to the north, the Rio Grande River...

[18:44:00] <LibertyDillo> What happened to the kettle?
[18:44:13] <morlog> has few pinholes
[18:44:32] <morlog> dont leak unless the pot gets hot
[18:44:50] <morlog> almost put my stove out
[18:45:27] <morlog> my saucepan is big enought for me to make coffee with so I'm not without
[18:47:41] <morlog> also have my bean pot
[18:47:44] <FreeRangeDillo> Surely the sort of thing which could be found at a 2nd hand store cheaply
[18:47:53] <morlog> yeah
[18:47:58] <morlog> they open at 10
[18:50:48] <morlog> gives me a good excuse to get a new kettle
[18:51:01] <morlog> or camp cook set
[18:52:30] <morlog> get something to tide me over till then from the thrift store
[18:53:06] <morlog> been wanting to get a titanium backpacking cook set
[18:54:11] <morlog> titanium wont develope pinholes like aluminum
[18:54:45] <morlog> hmm, wonder if i could get rei to exchange it
[18:54:57] <morlog> might be able to just get a free replacement
[18:55:06] <morlog> benefits of being a member
[18:57:21] <louipc00D> or stainless steel

[18:58:11] <louipc00D> lol imagine u got kettle for life now
[18:58:34] <morlog> yeah
[18:58:43] <morlog> still want to get a titanium cook set
[18:58:53] <morlog> outperforms steel by a longshot
[18:58:58] <louipc00D> do you use acid to clean it?
[18:59:10] <louipc00D> in what way?
[18:59:20] <morlog> its lighter and titanium doesnt need a coating to be non-stick
[18:59:36] <morlog> cleans up a lot easier
[18:59:58] <louipc00D> eh overrated imo
[18:59:59] <morlog> i have a titanium plate and nothing sticks to it
[19:00:09] <morlog> can use it as a fry pan
[19:00:51] <morlog> then there is also the bullet proof thing

[19:05:00] <morlog> understandable
[19:05:04] <Panther> I will put it back when we are done.. he is almost out of time today anyway.

[19:21:24] <nativetexan> all laptops have a windows 11 upgrade option
[19:21:45] <nativetexan> free windows 11 (when availible)
[19:21:55] <Panther> There was a group of friends who met on StarLink every day for years, but, being old, they slowly died off, and now there is only him, and a woman who is currently in end-stage renal disease, so she isn't on much.
[19:21:57] <morlog> should be seeing laptops coming with win11 soon
[19:22:11] <Panther> I feel sorry for him being all alone.. his wife died a few years ago.
[19:22:21] <morlog> a web based client might be easier for him
[19:22:28] <morlog> like kiwiirc
[19:22:29] <Panther> That is what he uses.
[19:22:33] <morlog> ah
[19:22:43] <morlog> hmm
[19:22:49] <louipc00D> what starlink?
[19:23:02] <macrobat> don't gaming laptops go hot? and you'll learn less in college if you game :/
[19:23:03] <morlog> maybe make a link that puts him in here directly
[19:23:10] <Panther> Like.. on StarLink, our web page has a redirect to kiwi that fills in all the info for him.
[19:23:18] <morlog> ah
[19:23:18] <nativetexan> phone
[19:23:35] <Panther> Maybe.. I can see if Sea will set that up... she runs the webserver.
[19:23:39] <morlog> he was the guest that timed out
[19:23:41] <louipc00D> spacex internet service?
[19:23:47] <Panther> louipc00D, StarLink is my IRC network.
[19:23:49] <morlog> maybe his browser needs to be updated
[19:23:55] <louipc00D> oh
[19:24:05] <Panther> SpaceX tried to buy it from me :P
[19:24:12] <morlog> hehe
[19:24:17] <louipc00D> how much
[19:24:23] <Panther> Well.. the VP of Sales for SpaceX and VP od Starlink.
[19:24:23] <morlog> 5 potatoes
[19:24:54] <Panther> $100,000 plus an interview for a 6-figure job of my choice, plus VIP passes to rocket launches, and tours of the rocket plant.
[19:25:15] <louipc00D> fuk man whyd u hold out
[19:25:42] <morlog> hes not a sell out
[19:26:13] <Panther> I am still using it. Also, as the CEO, I have a responsibility to the users and other admins... they said I could sell it if I wanted to... I always made it clear that my decisions were always final. :)
[19:26:35] <Panther> But yeah, like morlog said.. I am not a sell out.
[19:26:36] <nativetexan> back
[19:26:43] <louipc00D> im sure you coulda worked something out
[19:26:47] <louipc00D> i am a sellout
[19:26:59] <Panther> I wanted $5million and a seat on the board.
[19:27:02] <nativetexan> phone again
[19:27:25] <louipc00D> so 5 million plus shares?
[19:27:26] <morlog> for a website domain like that it would only be fair
[19:27:31] <Panther> Plus, I wanted to control a subdomain of the domain so I could still run my servers.
[19:27:47] <louipc00D> yea having a subdomain would be reasonable
[19:28:12] <louipc00D> hey even the nerds within spacex could use it then
[19:28:22] <louipc00D> u could be their internal ircop too
[19:28:29] <Panther> I was close to doing it.. see.. he wanted it so he could set up some scheme to get donations and use them to provide free Internet to places that didn't have it.
[19:28:41] <louipc00D> fuck even mars astronauts could use it
[19:28:50] <louipc00D> fuckin low bandwidth comms
[19:28:52] <louipc00D> perfect
[19:29:12] <louipc00D> sure makes sense
[19:29:16] <Panther> But, he really had no idea of how to really do that. I spent 6 months at the Regoinal Foundation Center learning all about how to run and manahe non-profits.
[19:29:27] <Panther> manage
[19:29:37] <louipc00D> cool
[19:29:40] <Panther> So, I also wanted to be in charge of that.

[19:31:12] <morlog> too many pots
[19:31:19] <Panther> Yeah
[19:31:56] <Panther> I offered to let them have the hostname www.starlink.org for FREE.
[19:32:03] <Panther> And they turned it down :(
[19:32:06] <morlog> seems to be an ongoing theme of Elon's
[19:32:15] <morlog> too many projects
[19:32:54] <Panther> I said we could sign any document giving them the right ot first refusal if I ever sold the domain, and granting them a 100 year lease on that hostname for free.
[19:33:31] * Panther shrugs
[19:33:51] <Panther> But, they wanted all or nothing... and they couldn't afford all, so they got nothing. :)
[19:34:13] <louipc00D> Panther: u chatted with elon?
[19:34:38] <Panther> Nope, with his VP of Sales
[19:34:43] <louipc00D> ohka
[19:35:28] <Panther> First they sent a domain broker to negotiate with me, and that got up to $50,000, but I told them that was of no interest.
[19:35:35] <louipc00D> ppl are fukin unrealistic with their domains
[19:35:48] <nativetexan> brb, setting up the address in the software
[19:36:07] <louipc00D> broker fukin came to me trying to sell, and they say if i ask about price it goes up automatically like wtf
[19:36:09] <louipc00D> go away
[19:36:14] <Panther> After the 20% long term capital gains tax, and then I do have to give something to the other admins and staff, so I would wind up with next to nothing.
[19:36:49] <louipc00D> yea makes sense
[19:37:03] <louipc00D> hey u gotta factor in all the costs of upkeep over the years ;)
[19:37:11] <morlog> there is also the fact that the domain would most likely be the main address for the entire starlink program
[19:37:21] <louipc00D> the organisation
[19:37:34] <louipc00D> charitable one
[19:37:41] <Panther> Now he's busy building a nuclear power plant.
[19:38:01] <louipc00D> oh nice
[19:38:01] <morlog> if its charitable why do you have to pay an arm and a leg to use it

[19:54:08] <morlog> every year
[19:54:17] <morlog> i think for homecoming or something
[19:54:23] <nativetexan> yeah
[19:54:35] <morlog> someone fell in i think
[19:54:44] <nativetexan> or collapse
[19:54:47] <morlog> thats why its not happening like it used to
[19:55:14] <morlog> they built a huge platform tha went up over the top of the fire
[19:55:18] <morlog> out of wood
[19:55:28] <nativetexan> yeah, it was really tall
[19:55:30] <morlog> didnt end well
[19:56:08] <morlog> the platforms like that was a frat thing going on at the time
[19:56:20] <morlog> a party fad
[19:56:36] <nativetexan> a traditional fad, i think
[19:56:44] <morlog> not the platform
[19:56:51] <morlog> the bonfire yeah
[19:57:00] <morlog> platform was part of a party fad
[19:57:11] <morlog> build the biggest structure for your frat party
[19:57:33] <morlog> here in austin i saw some really elaborite ones

[19:58:09] <morlog> dang
[19:58:18] <morlog> they would top it with an outhouse
[19:59:19] <nativetexan> probably devoted some engineering thoughts to get it that high

[20:00:31] <morlog> think i need to get some switches for my keyboard that are a little bit more sensitive
[20:00:51] <nativetexan> cherry reds are super sensative
[20:01:02] <morlog> i have gateron browns right now
[20:01:17] <nativetexan> i use cherry brown

[20:01:37] <morlog> cherry's will work on my kb
[20:01:44] <Panther> That sounds like candy.
[20:02:00] <morlog> i can take an individual key switch out without haveing to desolder it
[20:02:13] <nativetexan> you could just breath over the cherry reds and they would type
[20:02:20] <morlog> nice
[20:02:32] <Panther> I pulled the caps lock key off my first kbd with pliers.

[20:46:57] <morlog> instead of a camera, the hdmi signal is sent through

[20:53:23] <artao> i've tried to sort it out previously with little success (which is why I have NDI installed hehe)
[20:54:24] <morlog> i would say that with that there is probably an app to handle the tablet side and that you would just need to plug it into the computer
