[00:39:00] <audrey> Hello.
[00:39:45] <voltage_> good day
[00:41:06] <alguien> lalia: About that question from yesterday, here it is: I was reading https://www.newadvent.org/summa/3020.htm and found am wondering about this reference from Aquina’s response in the 2nd article: “in order to pass from the universal opinion to the appetite for a particular thing, it is necessary to have a particular estimate (De Anima iii, 2)”. I heard you were his fellow aristotelian and might be able to tell me what the philosopher says in this

[00:51:22] <arryana> what is a 'universal opinion'?, and what is the 'particular thing' referenced?  what is a 'particular estimate'?
[00:51:44] *** Joins: alguien (~alguien@user/alguien)
[00:51:46] <alguien> whoopsie
[00:51:49] <lalia> alguien: I can explan a bit about what Aristotle is up to but am not presently equipped to speak on what Aquinas is up to. :)
[00:52:08] <alguien> only good things, I assure you :)
[00:52:38] <alguien> but pleas, do explain the philosopher
[00:52:38] <lalia> arryana: aquinas is trying to reconcile Aristotle's account of the soul with Christiaan theological doctrine.
[00:53:46] <alguien> I’m taking his reference to mean that certain principles espoused by Aristotle apply there, but I do not know the principles
[00:54:05] <lalia> In this case Aristotle is considering the connection between the senses and the faculties of the soul. (Soul is also sometimes read as mind)
[00:55:07] <lalia> He takes it that our senses give us an understanding of particular things.
[00:55:43] <lalia> While the way we sense with our mind/soul provides an understanding of what he's calling universal things.
[00:55:58] <lalia> Something like abstract rationality.
[00:56:41] <alguien> ok, and here comes a disconnect?
[00:59:56] <lalia> For Aristotle, sense perception is given structure and substance through something like abstract reasoning. Without the faculties of the mind/soul, there's no way to make use of the information conveyed through the senses.
[01:00:55] <lalia> For Aquinas, ostensibly, the senses also tend to mislead and harm people without the ability to reason.
[01:02:31] <lalia> So the important thing to attend to between them is the intellect (faculty of the mind/soul) rather than the appetites (faculties of the senses).
[01:02:37] <arryana> did he define all that somewhere i can read
[01:02:38] <arryana> ?
[01:02:58] <lalia> Aristotle gets into his treatment of mind/soul in a text called De Anima.
[01:03:11] <lalia> Aquinas kinda never shut up about it from what I remember. :D
[01:03:44] <lalia> The present discussion is based on his remarks in Summa Theologiae
[01:04:18] * arryana nods
[01:04:24] <arryana> thank you
[01:04:36] <lalia> alguien: I hope that helps. Let me know if you had something else you're wondering about, I'm shooting from the hip ATM.
[01:04:45] <lalia> Haven't worked on Aristotle super recently.
[01:05:15] <lalia> arryana. NP :3
[01:06:11] <lalia> De Anima and Metaphysics are still two of my favorite Aristotle texts: they're crammed full of interesting and applicable insights.
[01:06:57] <arryana> i will stick that on the list for when i get home
[01:08:26] <alguien> arryana: it’s a big work. If you’re wondering about the effects of Adam’s fall on our nature, see in particular “concupiscence”. If you want some Catholic stuff in the same vein, let me know (Sensus Fidelium youtube channel has some Fr Ripperger videos on particular topics - he’s a Thomist of a sort).
[01:09:02] <alguien> lalia: sorry, I wrote something for you but deleted it as I wanted to answer arryana, let me type it out again
[01:11:28] <alguien> lalia: So our fallen “senses” mislead us about the value of “particular things”, so that it differs from our “universal opinion”. I’m not 100% how that is still not disbelief
[01:14:32] <alguien> On one hand, I’ve sensed it myself of course, on the other - is that not a lack of faith? Or is it simply that our apetite is not … hey that could be it. Our apetite is not under our full control since the fall. But still.. if you indulge it, shouldn’t that be a different matter, haven’t you disbelieved and thought what your apetite was suggesting was more true than what your faith should be telling you?
[01:16:06] <lalia> My understanding is that or Aquinas, Dispair is a function of our emotions which is a product of the senses instead of the intellect. He appears to be suggesting that it's concievable for one to be a believer while experiencing despair.
[01:16:42] <lalia> He's basing this obervation on his reading of Aristotle.
[01:19:25] <lalia> I guess he's saying that the intellect is tied to the soul which is our connection to the divine.
[01:19:46] <lalia> As such he puts a lot of emphasis on mind read as soul.
[01:20:10] *** Joins: Pleiades (~admin@193.254.47.212)
[01:20:45] <lalia> alguien: But I'll go back to clarify one more time that I'm not great with Aquinas either, sadly. My area is specifically Ancient Greece with an emphasis on Attic texts. :)
[01:20:54] <lalia> I could probably use a refresher.
[01:21:18] <lalia> Never gonna have time for it tho... too much reading. :P
[01:22:48] <alguien> Most of your guesses are mostly correct from what I know of Aquinas, but can despair really be a mere emotion?
[01:23:44] <alguien> “just as the movement of hope, which is in conformity with the true opinion, is praiseworthy and virtuous, so the contrary movement of despair, which is in conformity with the false opinion about God, is vicious and sinful” - but how is there sin if there is no intention?
[01:24:05] <arryana> no, i'm not religious.  there was no adam and no fall.
[01:24:05] <lalia> That much is arguably in contention, right? He seems to be insisting that it is because for him it can be reasoned through with proper guidance from the intellect from what I remember.
[01:24:27] <alguien> Actually this very thing says it’s based on a false opinion
[01:24:53] *** Joins: atmoz (~atmoz@user/atmoz)
[01:25:06] <alguien> arryana: that is a false opinion heh
[01:25:45] <alguien> well not funny really
[01:25:54] <lalia> I'm not religious either. No interest in it beyond scholarship anymore either.
[01:26:05] <alguien> Anyway, despair is based on a false opinion
[01:26:33] <lalia> Right, and opinion is a very simple thing.
[01:26:33] <arryana> no, it is your opinion that it is false.
[01:26:37] <arryana> you have no proof.
[01:27:00] <lalia> For aquinas opinion is impulse which is also a function of the senses.
[01:27:00] <audrey> Despair might be based on truth.
[01:27:06] <audrey> The truth might simply be worthy of despair. :D

[01:27:59] <alguien> why are you interested in philosophy? All philosophers are wrong. Aristotle less than others I guess, but even he. But the others, they have some wild contradicting opinions. Is it just fun for you? What about the pursuit of Truth and Wisdom (I know why I capitalize :))?
[01:28:12] <audrey> All philosophers are wrong?!
[01:28:24] <audrey> Someone needs to tell the faculty at my alma mater. They´ll be shocked.
[01:28:28] <Parf> yeah, now that i'm here!
[01:28:30] <evolv> alguien, most people haven't accepted the truth of the dhamma
[01:28:35] <evolv> so there's philosophy
[01:28:37] <evolv> bing bang boom
[01:28:41] <evolv> questioned answered
[01:28:44] <lalia> The issue with making Aristotle work with Aquinas is that the former has little to no interest in moving beyond virtue as conveyed through individual character.
[01:28:54] <audrey> evolv: that conversation is likely more appropriate for ##religion
[01:28:55] <Parf> it's just a new iteration that's replacing the old, is all! the philosopher king, long live the philosopher king
[01:28:59] <alguien> Discounting Jesus (if you would reduce Him or liken Him to a philosopher), I would say so.
[01:29:08] <voltage_> Parf, glad you're here
[01:29:09] <Parf> everyone knows socrates fought the senate to the death
[01:29:16] <evolv> audrey, it was more in jest to a foolish question
[01:29:18] <lalia> Aquinas wanted to make Aristotle's work about divine command compatible thinking which it resists.
[01:29:23] <Parf> but they muted it a little for the sake of not corrupting the youth even more than they already were
[01:29:59] <Parf> was there any censorship established during that period, lalia?
[01:30:02] <lalia> alguien: I guess I don't share your take. I'm a Plato scholar. Also, my interest in philosophy is mostly past-tense. :D
[01:30:02] <alguien> Even Aquinas is wrong in certain points, the man’s brilliantly intelligent and spiritual, and still you can find a rare false opinion in his thoughts. He’s merely human. But the pagans, they’re all over the place methinks
[01:30:04] <audrey> Jesus was an interesting guy. I like the Jefferson Bible. Oddly, reducing Jesus to just another prophet by removing references to the supernatural (miracles, overt theology etc.) somehow makes the ethical and spiritual teachings come through all the clearer. I think Jefferson was on to something.
[01:30:19] <evolv> alguien is baiting
[01:30:20] <audrey> Tolstoy had a similar project, which I´m not as familiar with.
[01:30:20] <Parf> you're kind, voltage
[01:30:21] <evolv> :P
[01:30:42] <audrey> But yes, overt religious/dogmatic conversations are better suited to ##religion and not to ##philosophy
[01:31:19] <lalia> Parf: Sort of? Less like censorship and more like criminalized impiety.
[01:31:22] <Parf> have you had any success in making religion active?
[01:31:25] <alguien> audrey: Aquinas addresses despair based on truth. Such is not sinful. And it is proper to the damned (punishment he says)
[01:31:51] <evolv> Various Eastern religions have intertwined raw religious and philosophy
[01:31:55] <audrey> I don´t believe in damnation or sin, so I think we´re on different conversation fields here
[01:32:00] <Parf> so the whole apology was a sort of example of the censorship bearing down on some "too dangerous" thoughts?
[01:32:07] <evolv> where is the line drawn there?
[01:32:15] <evolv> other than sheer proselytizing?
[01:32:31] <lalia> I'm a skeptic, but I like to be helpful. :) alguien: I've got to run soon, but I'm happy to talk ancient Greek whenever. Just ping me .
[01:32:33] <audrey> evolv: quoting from the channel rules...
[01:32:34] <audrey> ##philosophy also welcomes discussions on a wider range of issues, as long as these issues are approached through the lens of reason, good-faith inquiry, and academic rigor (as opposed to polemics, partisanship, or dogmatism).
[01:32:34] <audrey> Wider topics may include, among others: literature, science, religion, public policy, and recent events.
[01:32:38] <audrey> end quote
[01:32:46] <alguien> arryana: faith is the evidence of things unseen. A supernatural faith though, not a want, mind you
[01:32:48] <audrey> It´s not a super firm distinction but should get the idea across.

[01:33:21] <lalia> I better get back to house stuff and reading. :3 Richard Bett and Alan Bailey are calling.
[01:33:24] <evolv> audrey, aren't there philosophical areas that are anti-reason?
[01:33:43] <audrey> evolv: Yes, hence why «good faith inquiry» and «academic rigor» are included as catch-alls.
[01:33:51] * alguien missed some chatlines and has to scroll back
[01:34:03] <Parf> it would be neat if philosophy could shuffle a sort of daily given topic, at random, of a select few, that could scramble every 6 hours or so so as to not get too stale
[01:34:18] <Pleiades> Great idea!
[01:34:19] <evolv> maybe lens of reason can be reworded as "reasonable," audrey? I guess anti-reason discussions never come up to bother
[01:34:20] <lalia> evolv: I'm actually a fan of attacks on western conceptions of reasoning. :) It's a technical narrative tho, I'd say.

[01:35:34] <lalia> Sure, I'll hit you with a few shortly.
[01:35:48] <Parf> you think so Pleiades? and maybe a sort of "weekend free for all" topic slew. and the topics themselves would still be loose guidance for general chat, not to force anyone into any bottlenecks, not compulsory topics, anyway

[01:42:33] <evolv> arryana, how do classify something as a god?
[01:42:34] <audrey> alguien: ##religion might be a more suitable place for you, I think. ##philosophy tends to frown upon proclamations of dogma as those are very difficult (if not impossible) to reconcile with the channel´s objectives and scope, as defined in the rules.
[01:42:48] <Parf> chickens are jungle birds btw
[01:42:53] * alguien looks at rules
[01:43:02] <arryana> you believe it is the truth.  that does not make it the truth.

[01:44:21] <evolv> is there a threshold of superpowers where a sapient being is a god?
[01:44:25] <Parf> they should hook that quantum light scanner up to near infra red though, for sure
[01:44:26] <raincomplex> i find "what is god?" a far more interesting question than "do you believe in god?"
[01:44:44] <alguien> oh sorry, I thought I was talking to arryana, that she quoted the thing about dogmatism
[01:45:16] <evolv> the dhamma ate your dogma
[01:45:17] <alguien> as long as there is no belief, everything goes I guess raincomplex
[01:45:18] <Parf> and stick that in the brain, apparently near infra red frequencies of light can penetrate through bone and skin without harming either, and return a diffraction scattering that can be reassembled into functional scans of the brain itself

[01:50:56] <arryana> you're talking crap and i don't need you ranting beliefs at me
[01:50:58] <Parf> why is that more coherent? surely love wouldn't exist at all without some source for it, there certainly seems to be an overwhelming power of "evil" going on, but that doesn't give much rise in my mind to love alone
[01:51:01] <audrey> Please refrain from proselytizing in ##philosophy.
[01:51:05] <audrey> I won´t be asking again. Thank you.
[01:51:47] <voltage_> what about putting ##religion in the topic
[01:52:24] <Parf> all i'm saying is that the demiurge doesn't make it more coherent for the sake of an actual demiurge being extant, it just sounds like it's a preferable configuration for you because it would be more appropriate for this "hell" to be governed by something evil, eh?
[01:52:29] <alguien> arryana: do you think your true motive for trying to control what I say here is the good of ##philosophy or is it just that you dislike hearing my true opinion?
[01:52:56] <arryana> troll someone else.

[01:53:08] <audrey> Thank you.
[01:53:18] <arryana> you don't get to shove your beliefs down my throat as fact.
[01:53:56] <audrey> Parf: I mean, it makes no sense to me why "hell" would be created by some omni-benevolent being, etc. It would require a significant twisting of what we consider "benevolence".
[01:53:57] <Parf> i personally like living, quite a bit, is all, i guess it's strange, i don't think this is hell at all

[01:54:42] <voltage_> i love organized religion
[01:54:48] <audrey> Hell, if you can get people to believe that 1 is literally, mathematically, non-metaphorically equal to 3, you can get them to believe anything
[01:54:52] <audrey> Ex falso sequitur quodlibet
[01:54:55] <Parf> well, i don't know that logic can get us any god other than "the god of logic" if that makes any sense as an argument. i doubt we're ever going to reach "god" without a sort of universal approach to evil and good and the possible reasons for them
[01:56:35] <Parf> in good faith inquiry i think is in store here, were one to seriously consider god or demiurge, regardless of the theistic lens "it/they/he/she" is focues through

[02:02:12] <Parf> rips away all the themes, bare bones storytelling fun
[02:02:20] <lalia> Seems like something that'd be a ton of fun over beers and snacks.
[02:03:07] <lalia> I may play it in conjuction with the conflict resolution mechanics for Epidiah Ravachol's game "What is a Roleplaying Game?"

[02:03:16] <lalia> Also a super simple single-page game.
[02:03:47] <Parf> so you're ground up building a role playing experience with modular rules, something like a gurps but for conversational and contextual engineering?

[02:04:34] <lalia> Yeah, cooperative storytelling games are a lot of fun. I've been exploring them again recently.
[02:05:08] <Parf> narrative, story, i wrote for days on end about how important it was as a core of human language
[02:05:46] <Parf> context is that ever peeling moment of epiphany as order comes into vision, awarenesses are constantly fluctuating so it's hard to get a sense of it. anyway, sounds like a fun time, i hope it's a riot

[18:05:38] <lalia> Another sick day! Good times. :|
[18:06:18] <lalia> Netflix is whatever for me, but they've backed some great projects like both of The Haunting series.
[18:06:37] <lalia> The streaming service gets little to no credit for their involvement tho, IMO.
[18:07:46] <lalia> They invest in order to turn a profit, which is a functional model. They're not real into making the media tho from what I've read... they're strictly about financing and distribution.
[18:08:21] <zephyr_> lalia: That's the whole industry, really.
[18:08:43] <lalia> zephyr_: Huh?
[18:09:07] <lalia> Do you mean like... HBO and Showtime by comparison?
[18:09:45] <lalia> That seems like it sort of follows, except they're known for hiring exec producers for the projects they back, so they're arguably a lot more hands on.
[18:09:54] <lalia> Which is what I'm getting at really.
[18:11:08] <zephyr_> lalia: I thought you meant if creators get any less room in Netflix. I don't think so. It's quite marginal as opposed to the rest of the industry.
[18:11:41] <lalia> I'll dig up a few articles to share later, because I've read explicit evidence to the contrary.
[18:11:48] <audrey> Some HBO stuff is pretty good. I liked The Wire (even though that´s old hat by now)
[18:12:20] <audrey> Chernobyl was the latest one I watched from them, I would call it «OK», although the unrealistic portrayal of Soviet bureaucracy ruined the realism.
[18:12:25] <lalia> Dave Chappelle is a rather prominent example of one who's spoken plainly about his relationship to Netflix being real hands-off with him and numerous other artists have chimed in agreeing.
[18:12:26] <audrey> s/realism/storytelling
[18:12:27] <ro-bot-o> audrey meant to say: Chernobyl was the latest one I watched from them, I would call it «OK», although the unrealistic portrayal of Soviet bureaucracy ruined the storytelling.
[18:12:44] <lalia> zephyr_: so is there an example or set of them you have in mind?
[18:12:50] <audrey> I´m not too familiar with the machinations that go on beneath the scenes at the production level, though

[18:13:46] <zephyr_> lalia: Most of the shows from Netflix in particular seem to be coming out of the mill. That's also largely true of the industry. I think I was making a different point. It's alright. Don't mind me, please.
[18:14:14] <lalia> I'm interested and pay attention because I help make movies as part of my living. :P
[18:14:51] <zephyr_> lalia: I see.
[18:14:58] <lalia> I can see how most folks making contributions are doing so in a rather predictable fashion, but that's not unexpected: this pattern can be seen in ust about every profession, IMO.
[18:15:00] <audrey> lalia livin´ the life!
[18:15:01] <arryana> well, i tried to sit with a tea
[18:15:04] <lalia> Lots of filler and overlapping content.
[18:15:53] <lalia> zephyr_: if that's the sort of thing you had in mind, then that makes sense. It's hard to come by originality regardless of how much involvement a company like Netflix has.
[18:16:51] <lalia> A fair point, but one I'd urge artists to take responsibilty for since it seems like we're the folks who're able to make the most impact considering the conditions.
[18:17:28] <zephyr_> lalia: I just meant that you can't really have independent TV-shows with the kind of costs involved. I am not inside the industry but that is my impression. They decide what to make and would hire you to do it. You would be free to choose the background music, etc. You might enlighten me.

[18:20:17] <voltage_> i imagine any business would be hands off as long as you make them money and don't reflect badly on their brand
[18:20:24] <lalia> I take it that was once the case, but now it's observably less so. Hollywood ought to be undermined inasmuch as they're set to cater to generating profits instead of enabling artistic expression. There's too much potential in independent film making and community-driven projects anymore: the only things empowering the traditional industry these days are continued comfort and complacence.

[18:26:32] <lalia> I'm an academic philosophy researcher by training, so I've had to take whatever I'm being offered. :'D It's going real well tho. The friend I'm working closest with has just finished film school at UCLA and is working on producing the script he submitted for his thesis.
[18:26:57] <audrey> Film making! Envious :D
[18:27:07] <audrey> If I were doing college over again I´d try to get into film studies or something.
[18:27:59] <lalia> So he's got a crew and script he's working with in LA, while I'm doing artwork and website labor ATM, zephyr_. I learn about technical filmmaking practices from him and he gets design support and marketing advice out of me presently.
[18:28:23] <biys> wifes parents are in town
[18:28:33] <biys> the inlaws are pretty much complete idiots
[18:28:36] <lalia> Once the film is further into production, we'll have to be in LA for the work. ATM tho, I'm able to help from a few States away.
[18:28:53] <biys> for how educated my wife and her family is i can't believe how completely mindless her parents are
[18:29:09] <lalia> Lots of labour but the hope is... we'll have a feature film to show in the end. :D
[18:29:18] <zephyr_> lalia: What kind of software are you using?
[18:30:08] <zephyr_> biys: What did they do?

[18:31:22] <zephyr_> Panther: That's true.
[18:31:30] <audrey> biys: Seems like a fairly common scenario with in-laws.
[18:31:48] <biys> zephyr_: they honestly believe they are the smartest people to ever walk the planet
[18:31:56] <audrey> I´ve thought I was an anomaly because I actually liked my would-be in-laws (ex fiancée´s family)
[18:31:56] <biys> i wish i could say that as a joke
[18:32:04] <biys> but it is entirely true
[18:32:13] <zephyr_> biys: Did they literally state this?
[18:32:27] <lalia> I have an Adobe cloud account. Illustrator is my main tool for artwork, zephyr_. The website stuff has been absurdly easy because we're using Squarespace and have super basic needs. :) Mostly designing original poster art and poking around the UI wysiwyg.
[18:32:30] <audrey> Do you have to spend a lot of time with them? Hope not.
[18:32:42] <zephyr_> Panther: But I had another sort of cool people in mind, I suppose.
[18:33:23] <biys> audrey: well what happened was we bought their house off them.  they decided to leave many many many items here that i wasn't allowed to throw out.  so i actually had a verbal disagreement with them for the last 18-20 months about getting all their shit out (her father is a hoarder)

[18:33:42] <audrey> That sounds like a bad deal. Sorry you got dragged into that. :|
[18:33:56] <lalia> Our crew is quite a bit more focused on artistic expression and pushing personally fulfilling narratives.
[18:33:58] <biys> the thing about it is EVERYTHING has value
[18:34:03] <zephyr_> Panther: I agree.
[18:34:03] <audrey> I still have boxes upon boxes of my former fiancée´s possessions that she never threw away
[18:34:13] <biys> they want to keep everything but they want no involvement in the moving process
[18:34:18] <audrey> and I don´t have the money or inclination to mail them all to her (would probably cost in the thousands to ship transcontinental)

[18:34:56] <biys> dude.  her father literally goes through the garbage can (they are here right now overwatching the whole process)
[18:35:01] <biys> her father LITERALLY goes through the garbage every day
[18:35:07] <biys> and checks to see what i'm throwing out
[18:35:10] <Panther> Only a video of a tornado that went past my window.
[18:35:22] <lalia> You're unfamiliar with the turn of phrase then? I simply meant the folks we're talking about are a dramatic contrast. :3
[18:35:35] <zephyr_> biys: Throw it out discreetly. They can't hurt you once it's gone.
[18:35:58] <biys> zephyr_: our garbage only goes out weekly, so it sits in a bin until it gets picked up
[18:36:03] <biys> her father checks the bins every day
[18:36:06] <biys> and pulls stuff out
[18:36:13] <Panther> Everyone sets out to do the noble thing.
[18:37:06] <audrey> Sounds like a hella dysfunctional family. I´d get away from there as far as possible.
[18:37:10] <zephyr_> lalia: I was joking. I have heard cool kids talking about Akira Kurosawa and Jean-Luc Godard and God knows what else. I never really got all that.
[18:37:13] <biys> i told him, "if you're gonna keep stuff i don't want it put back in the house or the garage because i'm trying to clean"
[18:37:20] <audrey> Either that, or start being the world´s most un-guiltable, obnoxious, over the top asshole
[18:37:20] <biys> he says: "well where can i put it then?"
[18:37:30] <biys> i said: "where-ever you like"
[18:37:33] <zephyr_> biys: Take it in your car and throw it elsewhere.
[18:37:45] <biys> zephyr_: yes, increase my workload
[18:37:50] <arryana> jesus, just get a storage unit
[18:37:51] <audrey> which also works to shut up most annoying family members
[18:38:04] <audrey> because they usually work on guilt, and if you can´t be guilted, they have no power over you

[18:39:43] <arryana> indeed
[18:39:52] <audrey> Relationships can suck up SO much energy and emotion.

[18:40:09] <arryana> wow.

[18:40:29] <audrey> I haven´t had *that* many relationships, LOL :D
[18:40:30] <biys> voltage_: my wife is fine.  the problem is her parents.  here's an example.  we have a 8 month old.  the 8 month old is in the process of learning to walk.  she's cruising the couches.  we have foam down all over the floor to protect her if/when she falls.  the wife and i allow the baby to cruise basically all the time.  when my wifes mother shows up she feels the need to constantly be touching and hold
[18:40:36] <biys> the baby
[18:40:41] <zephyr_> biys: Call someone who would take all this stuff for free and ship if off when your in-laws are sleeping or out of home.
[18:40:42] <biys> and i'm like: "can you just leave here alone?  the baby is not here as a source of your entertainment"
[18:40:52] <biys> :s/here/her/
[18:41:03] <lalia> zephyr_: You'd be wrong. :P For us the philosophy background is integral. This is also the case for other film makers: there's a lot of thought put into developing these projects and some of it is inspiration from philosophical sources.
[18:41:08] <voltage_> biys, dude, she didn't warn you? clearly you married the wrong person
[18:41:11] <audrey> If they don´t have a legal claim to the property, you could always call the sheriff on them for trespassing.
[18:41:12] <arryana> good lord, let grandparents play with the baby
[18:41:18] <audrey> That´s a real «asshole move» but they get the message.
[18:41:24] <lalia> The Matrix is a good example of famous movies with heavy philosophy themes.
[18:41:35] <audrey> Either way, I´m afraid I´m not a great source of advice on relationships given my past history :D
[18:41:45] <biys> arryana: they're allowed to play with the baby... but every action the baby makes is not to entertain the parents

[18:43:08] <voltage_> biys, she will get over it, it's like playing with new toys for her
[18:43:50] <biys> here's another lul.  i found a bunch of old old pictures in the basement.  "beloved" pictures.  the pictures were laying on the floor, ourside of boxes, no organization or anything.  so i got a photo album and put them all in and organized them and such
[18:44:09] <biys> her mom took the photo album and pulled all the pictures.  put them all in a bag and said: "these are my favotire pictures"
[18:44:13] <biys> FAVORITE PICTURES
[18:44:23] <arryana> it's an eight month old.  if you're this bent out of shape about the way her grandmother plays with her, you're going to find parenting a long, hard slog.
[18:44:23] <biys> you mean the pictures that have sat on the basement floor for the better part of 30 years
[18:44:29] <biys> are your FAVORITE PICTURES

[18:45:33] <biys> pretty sure
[18:45:39] <voltage_> how come she doesn't allow your 8 month old near your mom

[18:59:41] <biys> i mean... i have a couple things that i keep because they mean something to me.  but i just can't really see how having sentiments towards an items that i just leave in a basement to deteriorate with time shows any level of regard for the particular item
[18:59:54] <biys> is this a crazy thought on my part?
[19:00:07] <biys> i'd believe that if the item had any level of sentimental value you'd protect that item and care for it and love it

[19:01:44] <arryana> i have no idea.
[19:02:36] <biys> audrey: i do also love your idea about the modern day problem of having stuff, filling a house, only to complain about the lack of space and needing a larger house to hold all your "sentimental" items
[19:03:24] <biys> i wonder what makes up the differences between people who hoard and people who don't
[19:04:24] <biys> the same could also be said about people who see inherent value in everything.  "i could do something with that, don't throw that out"
[19:04:39] <biys> then nothing gets done with the items, they just pile up
[19:05:15] <arryana> i'm pretty sure most hot beverages don't have carbs unless sugar is added, unless it's cocoa
[19:05:33] <arryana> but i'm no expert on such things
[19:07:46] <zephyr_> biys: People who hoard forget that they will die one day.
[19:09:08] <biys> that makes sense actually
[19:09:12] <biys> do you think that is actually it though?
[19:09:26] <biys> i mean... i could make sense of that but idk if my sense would be as a result of that thought
[19:09:54] <biys> one could say that the space that is being used for the hoarding could better be purposed for something/anything else
[19:10:39] <zephyr_> biys: It is. If you remember that you are going to die one day and that day might not be far away if you are old in a pandemic, you might lose interest in hoarding *things*.
[19:11:31] <zephyr_> biys: Apparently, the folks you were complaining about think that the President they voted for or the car they drive is going to save them from an inevitable death.
[19:12:23] <zephyr_> biys: My grandfather was like that. We cleaned his room only after he died.
[19:13:20] <biys> what's funny about that is her dad asked me the one time if i knew of an easy way to fix brake lines on a car
[19:13:27] <biys> i said: "yes, you replace the brake lines"
[19:13:32] <zephyr_> biys: I remember his room smelled awful because he forbade cleaning it.
[19:14:45] <zephyr_> biys: I also remember that the heart attack he had took only his life and spared all the *stuff* in his room. We found cash hidden in very unusual places. He was quite paranoid about us stealing things from his room.
[19:15:25] <biys> my problem is i like to think i can get inside the mind of people
[19:15:31] <biys> and understand things from their perspectives
[19:15:46] <biys> the hoarding thingg just doesn't make any sense to me no matter how hard i try
[19:16:24] <biys> if you feared your money being stolen why not put it in a bank?
[19:17:04] <biys> it seems like hoarding is a whole series of psychological issues
[19:17:07] <zephyr_> biys: He also had money in the bank. But also had petty cash and lots of useless stuff in his smelly room too.
[19:17:14] <biys> not just a singular
[19:17:45] <zephyr_> biys: It's not other-worldly. It's understandable. It's difficult to make them stop, though.
[19:18:44] <biys> what is to understand?
[19:18:54] <biys> what is understandable?
[19:19:04] <zephyr_> biys: As they say, "Losing all of your fortune is better than losing half of the fortune." You should throw all his stuff out without his knowledge and then tell him.
[19:19:12] <zephyr_> biys: The condition is understandable.
[19:19:25] <biys> oooh yah i get that
[19:19:59] <biys> i would have to wait until a wednesday night.  cause the garbage truck comes thursday
[19:21:18] <zephyr_> biys: Be discreet. I would give quite a lot to see the look on his face when you tell him this. I enjoy it more than anything else.
[19:21:44] <biys> i imagine it will cause him to become upset
[19:22:40] <zephyr_> biys: I do get a perverse fun to see people *upset* when their stuff is thrown away.
[19:23:01] <biys> it won't be anything that i know has actual value
[19:23:05] <biys> maybe just some of the scrap lumber
[19:23:15] <biys> the cut off pieces of 2x4 that has been in the house for 30+ years
[19:24:19] *** Quits: Heraes (~Heraes@user/romarain) (Quit: Leaving)
[19:24:25] <zephyr_> biys: I come from the other end of the spectrum. I am what is called the opposite of a hoarder. I throw things away.
[19:25:21] <biys> i am like that as well
[19:25:55] <zephyr_> biys: I regularly format my phone and computer. By regularly, I mean couple of days.
[19:27:30] <audrey> biys: The line between «I own possessions» and «Possessions own me» is a surprisingly thin one.
[19:27:56] <audrey> I wouldn´t consider myself a hoarder or anything, and yet I do cling on to a lot of functionally useless items, mostly due to inflated sentimental value or something.
[19:28:24] <zephyr_> audrey: I see. That's normal.
[19:28:46] <biys> brb.  baby food
[19:30:46] <lalia> I hoarded books until I started moving a bunch after my student years. :D
[19:31:05] <lalia> Not so much anymore: moving a library sucks shit.
[19:31:08] <zephyr_> lalia: When I left college, I gave almost all of my books to my friends.
[19:31:59] <lalia> As a scholar I'd have a hard time getting rid of *all of it* but I definitely downsized to around 1/5 of the total books I had as an academic.
[19:32:17] * audrey ponders mailing 100lbs worth of boxes transcontinental and sending her the bill
[19:32:25] <audrey> probably would be an asshole move on my part :P
[19:32:30] * Panther has about 1000 books from college.
[19:32:31] <lalia> Most of what I've kept are special gifts or texts I'd be stupid to get rid of after all the work I've put into'em. :D
[19:32:50] <arryana> my books largely got purged during moves as well
[19:33:08] <arryana> i have mixed feelings about that
[19:33:20] <lalia> Me too. I miss some of my collection.
[19:33:54] *** Quits: DunceCotus (~DunceCotu@user/duncecotus) (Quit: Connection closed)
[19:34:07] <Panther> Tho, 14 years at unis is bound to have some side effect.
[19:34:40] <lalia> My digital library is immense tho, and I've got a decent tablet now too. As such, I'm much less fussed about my lack of physical books anymore. :)
[19:34:49] <Panther> :)
[19:35:07] <Panther> I need a digital librarian.
[19:35:53] <arryana> i keep several kindles full of digital books in the zen room
[19:36:01] *** Joins: choozy (~quassel@75-63-174-82.ftth.glasoperator.nl)
[19:36:15] <Panther> I never tried to fill a kindle.
[19:36:25] <lalia> My friends who went for tenure have office space, so they've all maintained a personal library which I love... I pop in and steal (borrow) from them now. :D
[19:37:19] <arryana> my other half, fortunately, has a lot of books, so at least they still have representation in the house
[19:39:42] *** Joins: cammy (~cammy@user/cammy)
[19:41:20] <Parf> i have probably a thousand as well, panther
[19:42:36] <lalia> Between my partner and I, we've probably got 200-ish books now.
[19:42:50] <lalia> Used to be quite a lot more. :3
[19:43:25] <cammy> Books are nice
[19:43:38] <Parf> i could strip my collection down to about 100 i actually want to read, and even more abbreviated would be the list that i'd retain for the sake of reading again
[19:44:01] <lalia> I've got a few thousand sorted digitals tho, and like 10k unsorted texts I've nabbed for random reasons over the years.
[19:44:12] <lalia> cammy: Indeed. :)
[19:44:19] <lalia> also, welcome. o/
[19:44:58] <cammy> Thank you
[19:45:53] <lalia> Academic texts can sometimes be hard to find digitals for, but I've managed to get almost every bit of material I've gone after.
[19:46:03] <lalia> I've been pretty fortunate on that front.
[19:47:12] <Parf> man i love the dentist
[19:47:36] <lalia> A strange line. :D
[19:47:38] <lalia> Why?
[19:48:02] <Parf> i was being mildly sarcastic, but i do have a fancy for my dental hygienist
[19:48:51] <lalia> Ha! Amusing. :) I need to visit a dentist soon. I don't like spending money tho. :'D
[19:50:09] <Parf> i think the dental industry is definitely in need of deflation, no reason ripping a tooth out or filling one should cost so damn much.
[19:53:39] <audrey> I haven´t been to a dentist in years and probably should.
[19:53:48] <audrey> Dental insurance is pretty useless so I would pay out of pocket.
[19:54:45] <Parf> whoever thought of teeth was crazy, really. also, time. time and teeth were pretty bad inventions in retrospect
[19:54:53] <audrey> I dislike doctors in general
[19:54:56] <audrey> always negative experiences
[19:55:04] <Parf> what about psychs?
[19:57:36] <audrey> Heh, even worse.
[19:57:42] <audrey> I gave up on psychiatrists a while ago.
[19:58:13] <audrey> Don´t really need to pay absurd copays 2x a month to have some guy tell me I have secret phallic fixations.
[19:58:20] <audrey> (Yes, I´ve had them tell me that.)
[19:58:32] <cammy> The best people I have found to help with my mental health are myself and close friends
[19:58:42] <cammy> also random strangers even
[19:58:55] * Parf smirks
[19:59:16] <Parf> at the phallus comment, not the use of strangers and friends as mental therapy
[19:59:19] <voltage_> paying people to listen to you is the best
[19:59:52] *** Joins: pulse (~pulse@user/pulse)
[20:00:00] <Parf> people paying to listen to you is better
[20:01:12] <audrey> Also had some negative experiences with the meds I was given.
[20:01:21] <audrey> So all in all, not interested in going back to that.
[20:01:41] <audrey> Life isn´t that great, but it´s not-great on *my* terms, not someone else´s terms.
[20:01:41] <Parf> i always took psychiatry as a challenge
[20:01:45] <audrey> And I can just-about live with that.
[20:01:48] <cammy> I should be a reverse psychologist
[20:01:58] <cammy> have people PAY ME to let me yammer at them for an hour
[20:02:17] <audrey> These days if I had to go to a psychologist I´d probably pull the same trick as the protagonist in Ellis´ Less Than Zero - just make up random Freudian BS
[20:02:18] <Parf> my last therapist actually quit within a week after i stopped going to him, but he was actively harmful to his patients, i'd say
[20:02:24] <audrey> make the guy all excited and start talking about himself
[20:02:37] <Parf> he'd tell me his dreams about oprah and i'd analyze them for him
[20:02:55] <audrey> Feel like half of psychiatrists don´t actually know what they´re doing other than generalized non-falsifiable theories from 100 years ago. :|
[20:03:12] <Parf> after being to a few mental hospitals, one gets the impression that psych is an inexact science
[20:03:12] <cammy> lol
[20:03:23] <cammy> very inexact
[20:03:37] <cammy> Because a lot of it is very personal
[20:03:56] <Parf> good therapists though, worth their weight in gold
[20:03:56] <audrey> Mental hospitals are the worst. :|
[20:04:01] <audrey> Blight of Western civilization.
[20:04:06] <Parf> some of them, yeah
[20:04:15] <pulse> just take psychedelics. better than any psychologist
[20:04:27] <cammy> maybe
[20:04:31] <Parf> yeah, no way that'd go wrong
[20:04:51] <Parf> "i'm psychotic! now for the LSD!"
[20:05:01] <pulse> then LSD will show you just how psychotic you are
[20:05:08] <Parf> and other people, too
[20:05:14] <pulse> no, just you
[20:05:17] <audrey> Main thing to know about mental hospitals is that nobody there actually cares about your well-being. Their first priority is ALWAYS liability prevention.
[20:05:26] <Parf> have you done much acid, pulse?
[20:05:27] <audrey> Everything else, including the patients, is secondary at best.
[20:05:27] <cammy> yea it's sad
[20:05:40] <audrey> This is true of doctors in general, but especially of mental hospital settings.
[20:05:41] <pulse> audrey, of course, same as hospitals. you're a number there. it's hard to find someone with genuine compassion (but they do exist)
[20:05:48] <pulse> Parf, i've done LSD for the first time in my life 5 days ago
[20:05:48] <cammy> I don't want to be surrounded by people just as messed up as me
[20:05:53] <pulse> the best experience in my life
[20:05:56] <Parf> oh yeah?
[20:06:00] <audrey> What´s the old joke? The only professions with no honour are thieves and doctors ...
[20:06:03] <Parf> that's pretty neat. did you buy it?
[20:06:11] <pulse> Parf, no, it was gifted
[20:06:15] <Parf> festival setting?
[20:06:19] <pulse> nope
[20:06:26] <pulse> alone in the middle of the forest setting
[20:06:30] <audrey> I hope there aren´t any DEA plants in this channel. :x
[20:06:31] <Parf> that's pretty ideal
[20:06:32] <pulse> under the stars
[20:06:38] <pulse> audrey, i'm in europe xD
[20:06:42] <cammy> LSD is the one drug I would try
[20:06:45] <Parf> i'm working for the fbi, audrey, no big deal
[20:06:55] <Parf> we don't have time to worry about drug users anyway
[20:06:58] <cammy> Great you guys need to back off :P
[20:07:06] <Parf> DMT > LSD, in my experience.
[20:07:16] <pulse> LSD is about as much a drug as a car is a rhinoceros
[20:07:25] <pulse> your ego gets no pleasure from it
[20:07:26] <audrey> All that stuff is hella illegal around here and with my luck I´d get busted
[20:07:35] * Parf rubs his chin
[20:07:36] <pulse> yes, it's illegal because of idiots
[20:07:36] <audrey> Stone-cold sober for about a year now.
[20:07:44] <cammy> you can do shrooms here
[20:07:46] <Parf> there are a variety of pleasures that can come from a hallucinogen
[20:07:47] <audrey> not all that fun but probably better than the alternatives
[20:07:53] <audrey> also, pleasure is overrated
[20:07:58] <Parf> audrey, don't discount it, sobriety
[20:08:10] <pulse> pleasure _is_ overrated. i had fun once and it was awful
[20:08:12] <Parf> though, a sudden shift in perspective from time to time can be useful, or refreshing
[20:08:29] <pulse> Parf, i pretty much forgot who i was for about 4 hours
[20:08:35] <Parf> how much did you take?
[20:08:39] <pulse> and after that i've had some incredible feelings
[20:08:40] <audrey> That sounds terrifying, pulse.
[20:08:43] <pulse> Parf, 100ug
[20:08:48] <pulse> audrey, it was incredible
[20:08:49] <Parf> not a bad first dose
[20:09:00] <audrey> I´ve experienced ego death before and it is *not* fun
[20:09:02] <pulse> and definitely shaved off a bunch of my fears and psychoses
[20:09:09] <audrey> regardless of what some meditation junkies try to say about it
[20:09:12] <Parf> depends on what you're looking for, audrey
[20:09:20] <pulse> audrey, i think it's the most fun you could ever have on this earth. whether you get there through substances or meditation
[20:09:28] <Parf> i found a great deal of peace from my ego dissolution
[20:09:31] <pulse> the ego is the complainer
[20:09:38] <cammy> I would be interested in psychodelics more for the experience and the ride than using it to avoid problems or to cope with anything
[20:09:38] <pulse> once the complainer is gone you see reality for what it is
[20:09:39] <pulse> utterly magical
[20:09:51] <audrey> These days I´m just looking for a quiet, unassuming existence. I don´t care for thrills much anymore.
[20:10:00] <pulse> cammy, oh trust me you don't avoid any problems on psychedelics. if anything you meet them face to face
[20:10:11] <pulse> psychedelics aren't for escapism
[20:10:22] <pulse> they're for deep exploration of your own psyche
[20:10:22] <Parf> it all depends
[20:10:25] <cammy> It may be a last resort too
[20:10:31] <cammy> meditation is hard
[20:10:40] <audrey> I heard people with chronic depression usually have really bad trips
[20:10:41] <Parf> they can be used to escape and for introspection
[20:10:56] <audrey> because it brings up all the painful memories and experiences without the ego or superego there to keep it under control
[20:11:01] <audrey> I don´t think I´d dare do that
[20:11:07] <Parf> i have some bipolar genes in me, and i'd say i go through quite a few horrifying trips
[20:11:08] <cammy> Yeah I'm worried about that
[20:11:22] <Parf> every one of them has been beneficial, however, for me
[20:11:23] <audrey> So I´m very skeptical of psychedelics.
[20:11:33] <pulse> audrey, i've also heard that, but i also heard they do miracles with manic depressive people
[20:11:36] <cammy> Welcome to ##philosophy! The topic is d r u g z
[20:11:41] <audrey> If I wanted a cheap high I´d get some airplane glue or something.
[20:11:48] <Parf> xenon
[20:11:49] <audrey> Again though, not my schtick these days
[20:12:00] <pulse> except glue gives you brain damage
[20:12:09] <pulse> and LSD is one of the least physically harmful drugs in existence
[20:12:15] <cammy> so can anything in large quantities
[20:12:17] <Parf> dmt is shown to initiate neurogenesis, apparently
[20:12:18] <audrey> That´s not been my understanding
[20:12:19] <pulse> i've known people who huffed glue... they weren't normal
[20:12:41] <Parf> LSD is pretty dangerous if you're not careful
[20:12:43] <audrey> Seems there is a small minority of people who have mental seizures years or decades after taking LSD just once or a few times
[20:12:48] <audrey> It´s not risk-free at all

[20:13:57] <voltage_> Parf, no what's that
[20:14:00] <Parf> these days i make my jungle drugs purposefully horrifying
[20:14:05] <audrey> I´m all in favor of drug decriminalization, by the way, I am just /very/ skeptical of people who treat this as some kind of panacea
[20:14:26] <Parf> ergotism is a condition that comes from eating the alkaloids that ergot produces in large amounts, causes hallucination, madness, horrifying deaths,
[20:14:31] <audrey> I´ve known people who have had absolutely devastating trips on psychedelics
[20:14:33] <pulse> all i can tell you is that my trip a few days ago was one of the most significant things in my life
[20:14:37] <Parf> ergot is a fungus from which LSD is derived
[20:14:42] <audrey> Seems like this is bound to end up being anecdotal.
[20:14:53] <Parf> pulse, i'm glad your experience was solid. it sounds like a good headchange

[20:15:16] <pulse> if you ask me the fact that this substance is illegal is a crime against humanity
[20:15:18] <audrey> One of my favorite movies ever, but this scene is just depressing as hell
[20:15:31] <cammy> I feel like achieving those states without the aid of psychodelics might be more rewarding
[20:15:43] <audrey> cammy: Yes, me too.
[20:15:47] <pulse> cammy, it's also impossible
[20:15:52] <Parf> acid, mushrooms, ayahuasca, yopo, LSA, MDMA, Heroin, Cocaine, Methamphetamines,
[20:15:56] <pulse> and i've tried many ways
[20:15:57] <Parf> all sorts of interesting drugs out there
[20:15:58] <audrey> I haven´t gotten «high» on meditation, all I´ve gotten is «peaceful inner state» or however you want to describe it.
[20:16:09] <pulse> Parf, i wouldn't bundle psychedelics together with other drugs tbh
[20:16:09] <audrey> And to me that´s better than a high, anyway, because you´re still in control.
[20:16:19] <pulse> psychedelics don't cause physical dependence, and you don't feel weird the next day
[20:16:19] <Parf> you wouldn't, but i do, and that's fine
[20:16:21] <arryana> they both have their places, i think
[20:16:25] <cammy> audrey exactly
[20:16:26] <arryana> but it's easy to make either escapism
[20:16:38] <audrey> Meditation for me is purely a functional matter
[20:16:56] <audrey> I meditate so I can function in life and so I´m not destroyed by my inner self.
[20:17:03] <arryana> fair enough
[20:17:06] <audrey> There´s nothing mystical or religious or even particularly spiritual about it.
[20:17:07] <arryana> tools are good thinsg
[20:17:20] <audrey> I sometimes frame it in spiritual terms because those terms are the easiest to understand
[20:17:21] <pulse> i disagree, there's plenty mystical about meditation :D
[20:17:29] <pulse> you just have to get deep enough into it
[20:17:31] <audrey> but I don´t really think there´s any supernatural force behind it all
[20:17:39] <lalia> Substance alteration is unarguably risky but I've also really enjoyed the experience provided the right conditions.
[20:17:42] <pulse> totally disagree on that one, but i can understand the pov
[20:17:43] <cammy> I haven't been able to clear my mind enough for so long.
[20:17:47] <Parf> meditation for me is stream entering, it's completely aligned with my dreaming and dmt trips, with breathing exercises, i achieve a fairly close approximation to total inundation
[20:18:21] <lalia> I'm not a big fan of promoting substance use tho, seems like trying to advise someone on important matters without many of the relevant facts.
[20:18:33] <Parf> weeping usually takes place from the joy of epiphany and the wholeness and the concrescences
[20:18:46] <lalia> Individual experiences vary pretty dramatically with substance alteration.
[20:18:51] <cammy> Perhaps this summer I'll do another really long backpacking trip
[20:19:12] <Parf> i'm just thankful i can get to the same place without the drugs, mental breadcrumbs
[20:19:20] <cammy> Those kinds of things bring me the closest thing to "meditation" as I've ever had
[20:19:37] <lalia> I have friends who prefer bike riding... and I mean, do you. :)
[20:19:44] <pulse> all i can say is every other substance i tried leaves you worse off the next day. psycehdelics always leave me better off. almost like the mind gets dirty over time, and psychedelics flush things out
[20:19:50] <audrey> cammy: Where do you go backpacking, if I might ask? I thought about hiking out in West Virginia someday this summer, up in the mountains.
[20:19:57] <audrey> Just me and a backpack.
[20:19:57] <lalia> I'll say my biking friends spend just as much time with illnesses or in hospitals. :D
[20:20:00] <cammy> Colorado
[20:20:01] <pulse> what should be legal is to do these substances under clinical supervision in a controlled setting
[20:20:13] <pulse> but since it's illegal, you have no choice but to handle it yourself
[20:20:19] <pulse> making it actually far more dangerous than it should be
[20:20:43] <cammy> It's truly something else going places unmarked and untravelled, off trails
[20:20:53] <cammy> You can get miles from a single other person
[20:20:53] <Parf> really, if one can charge the fear, and break past the protective barrier of the amygdala, one can fall into a state of "superego control", i don't even think superego is a good word for it, i like to call it the arbiter, the sorting system that crafts the world that is presented to the "self-echo" which has been derived from the bleeding edge that is the flesh. the sensorium is edited, frankly, by the arbiter
[20:21:08] <audrey> cammy: Yes. I miss that kind of seclusion.
[20:21:17] <audrey> I live in the outskirts of a big city and it´s a bit suffocating sometimes.
[20:21:26] <cammy> Just go for it
[20:21:42] <Parf> i was just complaining earlier about not having enough local trails
[20:21:50] <cammy> What I really want is another person to experience that stuff with
[20:21:55] <Parf> same
[20:22:08] <arryana> there might be hiking clubs near you
[20:22:22] <Parf> there aren't even any trails
[20:22:29] <cammy> you don't need trails

[20:22:38] <lalia> It's awesome.
[20:22:41] <arryana> indeed
[20:22:59] <arryana> there's miles near me, when i'm at home
[20:23:01] <Parf> "where we're going, we don't need roads!"
[20:23:11] <arryana> dallas is walkable in some weather, but not today
[20:23:32] <audrey> IDK. Being with another person would spoil the effect for me.

[20:23:50] <Parf> audrey's hell is other people
[20:23:50] <audrey> I used to live alone in an apartment and there was something unnervingly ... pleasant about having nothing but yourself for a few days
[20:24:11] <arryana> i don't mind hiking with other people if they're quiet.  otherwise i preferred hiking with the wolf/dog/cat
[20:24:15] <Parf> single cell isolation in prison isn't too bad either
[20:24:16] <pulse> some people can't stand loneliness, some enjoy it. i'm of the latter type
[20:24:20] <cammy> Yes but I feel like I owe it to the people who are close to me to bring such an impactful thing to me into their lives
[20:24:29] <arryana> oy
[20:24:34] <audrey> Oh come now, Parf, those are not the same thing.
[20:24:40] <Parf> i've been, and they are
[20:24:40] <arryana> enjoy it yourself.  if they want it they'll ask you.
[20:25:18] <lalia> I don't care for people too much but I also depend on social interaction for work and whatnot.
[20:25:23] <lalia> So...
[20:25:24] <audrey> They ... aren't? Like, what kind of comparison can you make other than the completely superficial.
[20:25:30] <Parf> it's quite the same, the isolation is freeing, one can fully face themselves, all things are according to one's own desires, save freedom, i suppose, but if you're commonly a hermit, or a shut in in any way, it's convenient to have people bring you food every day and shove it through a box
[20:25:32] <audrey> Not sure what the point of the comparison is.
[20:25:47] <audrey> Incarceration is not the same as living alone.
[20:25:49] <audrey> Really confused here.
[20:25:50] <cammy> I am pretty introverted but I still have the desire to meet someone I deeply connect with some day
[20:26:01] <Parf> it is a lot alike, audrey, trust me
[20:26:16] <pulse> highly doubt that Parf
[20:26:20] * Parf shrugs
[20:26:26] <pulse> if you live alone you can always choose to go out and have a walk in the park
[20:26:41] <Parf> "save freedom" as my comment above
[20:26:42] *** Quits: nick (~igloo@42.106.13.186) (Client Quit)
[20:26:48] <lalia> Doesn't seem a lot alike... :|
[20:26:51] <pulse> not to mention the freedom of actually being alone, not answering to guards and other people in the prison hierarchy
[20:27:05] <Parf> in single cell isolation, you're not spoken to whatsoever
[20:27:12] <pulse> ah
[20:27:13] <Parf> it's quite literally a box and you
[20:27:17] <Parf> and a food hole
[20:27:23] <pulse> windows?
[20:27:31] <Parf> yes, legally required to get daylight
[20:27:33] <lalia> Incarceration seems like it depends on a ton of structured social interaction.
[20:27:36] <lalia> Even isolation.
[20:27:36] <pulse> right, that's for the criminal psychotics
[20:27:50] <Parf> not just psychotics, protected as well
[20:28:23] <lalia> In context it's viewed as a extreme punishment... about as extreme as jailers are legally allowed to get.
[20:28:29] <Parf> say if you're a political target, or a police officer, usually they opt to be outside of "general population"
[20:28:32] <arryana> i must be missing something, but i don't see how punitive isolation is the same as being comfortable in your own company
[20:28:35] <Parf> there is isolation within the isolation
[20:28:46] <lalia> It's quite a bit different from voluntarily living alone in one's own comfort.
[20:28:47] <Parf> "in your own company" is not "living alone"

[20:29:20] <lalia> I'm with arryana, I feel like they don't compare outside of superficial observations.
[20:29:30] <lalia> It's more confusing to relate them than anything.
[20:29:32] <audrey> I have no idea what Parf's point is :|
[20:29:33] <Parf> clearly it's an experience that is hard to equate, given that none of you are familiar with it, but once the initial pangs of the free spirit pass off, it's extremely like living alone, reading, writing, thinking, meditating
[20:29:38] <[itchyjunk]> arryana, any fruit juice beverage has carb
[20:29:41] * Parf shrugs
[20:29:43] <audrey> What makes you think I'm not familiar with it, Parf?
[20:29:44] <cammy> Being locked in a cell is very different from being lost alone in wilderness
[20:29:45] <[itchyjunk]> heck, tea has some calories :<
[20:29:55] <audrey> You don't know enough about my history to make that observation, I don't think. :3
[20:29:59] * arryana giggles
[20:30:00] * Parf shrugs
[20:30:06] <arryana> i've spent months alone
[20:30:09] <Parf> in any case, in MY experience
[20:30:16] <audrey> OK, that's better.
[20:30:19] <lalia> Parf: I've studied isolation in an academic capacity some... it's a terrible ordeal that gets a lot of critical attention for how destructive and harmful it is.
[20:30:20] <Parf> LIVING ALONE AND LIVING IN ISOLATION IN PRISON ARE SIMILAR

[20:31:14] <audrey> I don't understand.

[20:33:07] <pulse> capslock is cruise control for cool
[20:33:09] <lalia> cammy: I studied it as part of an ethics paper criticising corporal and isolation based disciplinary practices.
[20:34:15] <lalia> The paper took a few cases of inmate isolation into account because the reports often include records of extreme psychological distress or mental breaks.

[20:34:36] <lalia> Some of the people who're subject to isolation disciplines never recover from the trauma and it's dramatic.
[20:34:55] <lalia> Like... as if they've experienced severe brain damage.
[20:35:06] <lalia> It's super unpleasant and somewhat depressing.
[20:35:14] <pulse> if you know how to meditate, isolation is going to be the best experience in your life
[20:35:20] <pulse> if you don't know how to meditate, it's going to be the worst experience in your life
[20:35:21] <lalia> I don't recommend the research. :P
[20:35:28] <cammy> depends on the person pulse
[20:35:50] <lalia> Volunary isolation, sure.
[20:35:54] <cammy> I do well alone but not locked in a box
[20:36:25] <lalia> It's hard for me to put meditation idealizing onto people who're being treated as prisoners.
[20:36:39] <lalia> That seems like a shitty narrative move.
[20:36:49] <pulse> i've heard of violent prisoners who learned to meditate and it changed their whole outlook
[20:37:05] <pulse> meaning they can actually enjoy life
[20:37:13] <lalia> Maybe you should look for studies on isolation cases where people claim to have done alright?
[20:37:18] <lalia> That'd be amusing.

[20:37:53] <lalia> o/
[20:38:04] <audrey> Anyway, the psychedelic trip in Easy Rider is probably my favorite.
[20:38:19] <audrey> People today think it's some kind of druggie movie, but I think the complete opposite
[20:38:28] <audrey> the film's attitude toward drugs is mixed, at best
[20:38:46] <pulse> my favorite is the one in fear&loathing in LV
[20:38:47] <Parf> a zietgeist on denizens of the counterculture
[20:38:49] <pulse> arguably a bad trip too
[20:38:54] <pulse> but it's very true to form
[20:38:57] <audrey> Billy and Wyatt seem to have been so spaced out by weed and LSD and booze that they don't even care that much when their friend is brutally beaten to death in a swamp
[20:39:15] <pulse> that sounds like a bad setting to do LSD in audrey lol
[20:39:29] <audrey> they don't really care about anything but themselves, except for the last few scenes where Wyatt starts realizing this isn't where he wanted his life to lead
[20:39:41] <audrey> hence the famous quote about "We blew it, Billy"
[20:39:42] <pulse> you don't really know wtf is happening on LSD, and if you happen to meet someone in a foul mood, you'll absorb that mood 10 thousand fold
[20:39:45] <pulse> not recommended

[20:39:55] <audrey> It's a pretty heartbreaking movie, really.
[20:39:56] <pulse> you gotta go into it with a relaxed mind
[20:40:13] <pulse> and only around people you 100% trust
[20:40:17] <audrey> Two schmucks who got rich on a drug deal in Tijuana and thought it was their ticket to the American Dream.
[20:40:25] <audrey> Which, of course, proves elusive as ever.
[20:41:00] <audrey> Reminds me a bit of the story in Blue Oyster Cult's The Last Days of May
[20:41:08] <audrey> That's prime novel material right there.
[20:41:49] <pulse> actually mckenna said that the right way to do psychedelics is a huge dose, alone, in a quiet, dark room
[20:41:51] <Parf> you ever seen the way of the gun?
[20:41:56] <pulse> which... seems about right i guess
[20:42:07] <pulse> only i'd be worried about you know, jumping out of a window or whatever
[20:42:27] <audrey> I'm legit afraid I would try to kill myself if I were to consume psychedelics.
[20:42:32] <pulse> although judging by my experience that's not really a problem since your legs don't really work well on peak
[20:42:32] <audrey> I had bad enough experiences with alcohol.
[20:42:41] <audrey> Xanax could calm me down but that stuff is poison for other reasons.
[20:42:45] <pulse> audrey, alcohol isn't even 0.0000000001% similar to psychedelics
[20:42:48] <pulse> alcohol is an ego drug
[20:42:51] <pulse> psychedelics kill ego
[20:42:52] <Parf> offs
[20:42:57] <Parf> not all of them do.
[20:42:59] * audrey rolls eyes and just says, Okay...
[20:43:09] <pulse> Parf, all of them kill the ego in sufficient doses
[20:43:10] <Parf> some of them enhance the ego tenfold
[20:43:12] <pulse> only in mild doses
[20:43:18] <pulse> Parf, then they're not psychedelics
[20:43:23] <pulse> they're deliriants or what have you
[20:43:23] <Parf> right, you're the professional
[20:43:36] <pulse> Parf, i've devoted a significant chunk of my life investigating psychedelics
[20:43:40] <Parf> so have i
[20:43:41] <pulse> both actively and intellecutally
[20:43:51] <Parf> i've isolated dimethyltryptamine personally
[20:43:54] <pulse> Parf, which substance are you talking about then
[20:44:06] <Parf> a slew of them, psilocybin, dmt, lsd
[20:44:10] <pulse> DMT is the #1 ego killer
[20:44:12] <Parf> each of them have various effects
[20:44:15] <audrey> I'm starting to wonder if this conversation is even appropriate for ##philosophy
[20:44:19] <pulse> yes, but they're all similar
[20:44:21] <audrey> Isn't there like, ##drugs or something
[20:44:25] <audrey> (there should be if there isn't)
[20:44:25] <Parf> probably not, audrey
[20:44:38] <Parf> regardless, i agree
[20:45:00] <pulse> audrey, why not? because of some phony laws made by absolute idiots?
[20:45:34] <Parf> because it's not really on the topic of philosophy, were you to rephrase the inquiry, perhaps it would be more appropriate, i think, is the suggestion here
[20:45:48] <Parf> not you personally, but just generally speaking
[20:45:50] <audrey> pulse: Because the conversation is degenerating into ad hominems and anecdotal evidence
[20:45:57] <pulse> isn't it though. i mean psychedelics are the #1 thing that influenced my philosophy of life
[20:46:00] <audrey> and neither is anything we can really approach from a philosophic perspective
[20:46:21] <pulse> i think my personal philosophy would be drastically different had i not taken a few of these substances
[20:46:30] <pulse> i'd probably be some type of reductionist materialist
[20:46:36] <pulse> very high brow
[20:46:44] <pulse> now i appreciate the mystic texts more than any science
[20:46:55] <pulse> mostly because it's closer to truth
[20:47:34] <audrey> I'm deeply skeptical that drugs actually unlock real truth. It's like when you're dreaming someone is playing music, you think it's the most sublime thing ever and you have to remember it, then you wake up and in the cold light of day you realize it's just a melody from Loony Tunes
[20:47:51] <pulse> audrey, have you ever tried a psychedelic substance though
[20:47:52] <audrey> Either way, there isn't much for philosophy to work with if all it's about is popping pills.
[20:47:57] <audrey> Yes, and they fucking suck.
[20:48:01] <pulse> interesting
[20:48:13] <pulse> can't say i share the experience
[20:48:39] <audrey> Insofar as philosophy ultimately tries to get at the nature of reality, and drugs are a wholesale *removal* of the mind from reality, I can't see much if any overlap.
[20:48:40] <Parf> that sums up today in a nutshell, personal experience clashing
[20:48:47] <pulse> i've had very mystical experiences, particularly with salvia divinorum. that was a decade ago though so my memory of it is shoddy

[20:49:28] <pulse> audrey, the way philosophy is normally done is through logic. but wisdom isn't logical
[20:49:48] <pulse> wisdom is that that transcends simple and naive notions that reality can be unfurled into a logical map
[20:49:49] <audrey> Inebriation involves some diminishing of the capacity to perceive or react to the world around us.

[20:50:04] <pulse> albeit it at a high price

[23:33:03] <ethereal> mycelium, yourcelium
[23:34:48] <Parf> speaking of fungi, i figured out how to establish a direct symbiosis with a fungi the other day
[23:35:58] <ethereal> fungi in symbiosis with yourself?
[23:36:29] <ethereal> i guess if you hyper zoom out there's already that link
[23:38:25] <arryana> haha, symbiosis with fungi
[23:38:55] <Parf> yeah, but this is more direct

[23:51:00] <voltage_> here you go
[23:51:14] <Parf> i do love me some infected mushroom
[23:51:18] <Parf> but i'm more of a heavyweight guy
[23:51:21] <ethereal> a favourite
[23:51:22] <Parf> also, shpongle
[23:51:34] <ethereal> only if actually dropping shponglay
[23:54:35] <ethereal> the risk of contamination is high doing any mycology stuff, they need their flow hoods, glove boxes
[23:55:11] <Parf> i'd love to have a flow hood
[23:58:12] <ethereal> lol some makeshift versions are doable, or a 'still air box' which is as good as not using one
