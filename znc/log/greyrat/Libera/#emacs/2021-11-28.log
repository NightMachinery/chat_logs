So I have a few dozen customers in need of a made a printer supplies and as well as one local business customer (electric coop in Montana) in need of a general cleaning of their system. I think making my own CPQ might be easier than managing a half dozen users right now.
[06:51:10] <hodapp> judybot: The biggest problem with having an AS/400 running inside the same van I live out of is
[06:51:11] <homerj> hodapp: do they have a way to get all the software/licensing?
[06:51:11] <judybot> hodapp: the noise it makes. The board is always on 24x7 in the van. It makes my overall power bill go up, and staying in the van stirs up dust very easily. As it is, during our early years of marriage, I didn't mind the noise because we was fairly close to St Marys Hospital and we could see them work. Now, after
[06:51:47] <hodapp> uh, wow. living in a van with a spouse *and* an AS/400.

[06:53:04] <homerj> I dunno
[06:53:20] <hodapp> judybot: The easiest way to get a copy of z/OS is probably to
[06:53:21] <judybot> hodapp: dial the IBM telefone numbers and order a copy from IBM (in a DOS printer type command mode) . Some people like to have one local and a local and one REMOTE copy in their WebSphere z/OS environment.

[08:36:59] <pingpongball> Any videos would you give me guys to make emacs look like doom emacs, i mean with packages vterm, projectile, vertico, zen
[08:37:08] <pingpongball> I dont want to poor performance by using doom emacs.
[08:37:19] <pingpongball> I just want to configure what i need.
[08:37:25] <pingpongball> Hey guys , any video suggestion.
[08:38:06] <Nistar> pingpongball: I like SystemCrafters on Youtube
[08:38:14] *** Joins: pmy (~user@user/pmy)
[08:38:29] <Nistar> He's very knowledgeable and helpful. I've chatted with him a few times on his Discord.
[08:38:31] <spudpnds> I second that, he's got a lot of good content to get started.
[08:38:38] <pingpongball> yeah, but he is too long i hate that way , Although his tutorial are so much great i like it
[08:39:15] <Nistar> Speed it up by x2 and use timestamp guides to skip through content
[08:39:26] <Nistar> His videos are fairly well indexed
[08:39:39] <spudpnds> I hate to say this pingpongball, but Emacs might not be for you, the impatient type. It's got a steep learning curve, and requires a lot more than 3-4 hours or watching some fast videos. It's a deep subject.
[08:39:58] *** Quits: lisp123 (~lisp123@5.30.23.247) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[08:40:07] <pingpongball> :) ¬† ¬† no emacs is for me.
[08:40:10] <Nistar> Not sure how much more of a silver platter you need this handed to you.
[08:40:34] <spudpnds> Nistar's tip about watching on x2 speed is a good one, but ultimately reading is the best.
[08:40:54] <spudpnds> Emacs has AMAZING documentation, you'd be well served by learning how to use its "info" system.
[08:41:15] <pingpongball> requires a lot more than 3-4 hours or watching
[08:41:15] <pingpongball> I dont mean , i dont want to give time configuring time on emacs. But i'm saying , for sme just get things done at first, so that i would focus on coding rather on configurating
[08:41:21] <Nistar> I only watch videos at 2x or more. It's a good skill to develop. And I will admit, I've been led astray but a lot of Emacs documentation.
[08:41:37] *** Quits: s-liao (~s-liao@101.86.99.70) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[08:41:38] <pingpongball> but i'll put more functionalities later in life if needed in coding.
[08:41:40] <spudpnds> The whole manual is there (info), plus a guide to learning Emacs lisp, plus a reference guide to emacs lisp, info is an amazing (if a bit weird) tool.
[08:42:12] <Nistar> SystemCrafters is recent content by someone with *experience* using the ecosystem. A lot of the content on the Emacs wiki and such can be very dated, you will be led astray without prior experience usingg Emacs.

[08:42:29] <spudpnds> Yeah, the Wiki has a lot of rot.
[08:43:00] <Nistar> People in #emacs are also very helpful.
[08:43:11] <pingpongball> :) ¬† i love system crafters video, but its too long videos , he wastes much time .
[08:43:19] <Nistar> But you want to build a foundation, you should check out SystemCrafters + the manuel. One-off questsions are good to raise here.

[08:43:30] <pingpongball> It would be great if he use video crispy edited all unnecessary parts
[08:43:48] <pingpongball> I was saying like this tutorial, i found great but not so deep.
[08:43:50] <pingpongball> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C9GbmIP1EA
[08:43:57] <pingpongball> a kind of playlist type. but
[08:45:30] <pingpongball> ummm
[08:45:39] <spudpnds> Crisp editing takes a long ass time.
[08:45:53] <spudpnds> Dude makes videos in his spare time for free.
[08:45:57] <Nistar> I've had to reverse engineer entire embedded systems with zero documentation and only hex, and build my own API before. If engineers like myself like have done that, you can sit through a few hours of SystemCrafters :-P
[08:46:31] <spudpnds> You can suck down information from reading way faster than you can from a video.
[08:46:49] <akater[m]> spudpnds: AMAZING documentation wouldn't require studying an info system.
[08:46:52] <Nistar> He couldn't spoil you anymore but sending you a free hooker with every video.

[09:07:16] <bpalmer> so, systems crafters videos don't work for pingpongball ; no need to badger the person.
[09:09:25] <Nistar> I think our criticisms for pingpongball isn't so much that the videos don't work for him, but trying to give him realistic expectations about the quality of documentation availiable to people working with computerized tooling.

[10:03:24] <bpalmer> ooh, an xml-rpc interface
[10:03:33] <aidalgol> bpalmer: OK, so first the X problem: I'm trying to wrangle a proprietary steam game server into systemd, when it does not play nicely with that ecosystem.
[10:04:29] <codingquark> aidalgol: http://supervisord.org
[10:05:44] <aidalgol> I have it running as a systemd service, but it can only be updated through steamcmd, which has an incredibly shitty interface, with no (stable) way to determine whether running "update this app" actually changed anything.
[10:07:28] <aidalgol> So I am attempting to write a wrapper script for the game service that stops resetting the service's watchdog (set via WatchdogSec=) when the mtime of any file in the game's install directory has changed in the past n minutes.
[10:07:48] <aidalgol> codingquark: OK, yeah, that is *total* overkill for this. :P
[10:07:49] <bpalmer> aidalgol: ah. This almost immediately screams to me as "do it in python" (or a real language).
[10:08:04] <aidalgol> bpalmer: Possibly, but it's juuuust on the threshold for me personally.
[10:08:09] <bpalmer> since you're trying to actively manage concurrency
[10:08:50] <aidalgol> Sort of, but also not really.  I think I can just background the game process and keep running find + stat on the target directory.
[10:09:02] <bpalmer> now, on the other hand, consider a Fuse overlay that intercepts write requests and allows them through, but only after triggering a sentinel that something has changed and when...
[10:09:41] <bpalmer> also, you might be able to take advantage of a notify interface, although that's inheretnly going to be different on macos/windows/linux

[21:13:43] <krux02> only on linux I have a truly working neo layout. So I am also locked in in the free software world.
[21:14:13] <krux02> Windows is a long time ago, OSX test was recent.
[21:14:18] <krux02> OSX was bad.
[21:14:28] <krux02> can't recommend anyone on OSX that layout.
[21:14:31] <thblt> My understanding of Neo is that it has an ‚Äúoptimal‚Äù definition, and various degradation strategies when it can't be fully implemented.
[21:14:46] <krux02> yea kind of
[21:14:51] <krux02> the base layer works
[21:15:16] <krux02> but when I want to make myself comfortable and use it as a work environment everything but "optimal" isn't acceptable
[21:15:26] <thblt> That's surprising, because MacOS' layout format is *very* good, AFAICT.

[21:17:56] <krux02> maybe you can fix neo ;)
[21:18:00] <thblt> The main issue I guess with Neo is the unusual number of levels. That's really a XKB thing, afaict.
[21:18:38] <krux02> the key between shift and z is used as an additional modifier and it is important that it works

[21:52:33] <krux02> technomancy, have you looked at the SDL2 API wher you get scancodes and typed characters and you can read tham as you wish, so that WASD for movement can be implemented layout independent?
[21:52:49] <artefact> layouts in hardware don't work very well in my experience
[21:52:53] <thblt> But there's an external keyboard involved at some point, right? If it's just the laptop and its integrated keyboard, I don't see the point (except personal preferences)
[21:53:03] <artefact> unless the modifiers match up perfectly
[21:53:07] <technomancy> krux02: I've done that in love2d a bit, yeah. but it's not an approach that works systemwide
[21:54:01] <technomancy> thblt: yes, this was a problem back when I had a laptop where the internal keyboard could not be remapped and I wanted to primarily use an external keyboard. it's not a problem for me anymore because I can remap both the internal and external in firmware.
[21:54:27] <artefact> have you tried kmonad?
[21:54:46] <technomancy> anyway you could also say that the root cause is dvorak; if you use colemak it doesn't have that problem because the punctuation is in the same qwerty location
