[05:04:05] <Blondie101010> since you just said it was mounted, I can hardly believe that error message
[05:04:16] <Blondie101010> how do you mount it with sudo?
[05:04:46] <Na_Klar> works with sudo
[05:04:52] <Blondie101010> I asked *how*

[05:07:39] <PMT> I believe actually specifying source and destination means it doesn't give a damn what's in fstab.
[05:07:50] <Na_Klar> oh
[05:08:15] <Na_Klar> but mount /media/point didn't work either. and noauto does not allow mount --all
[05:08:30] <Blondie101010> sudo mount /media/point
[05:08:34] <Blondie101010> does that work?
[05:08:43] <Na_Klar> unmount first i guess ..
[05:08:47] <Blondie101010> yes
[05:08:53] <Blondie101010> or: sudo mount /dev/sda1
[05:09:05] <Na_Klar> nope, same error
[05:09:10] <Na_Klar> like without sudo
[05:09:30] <Blondie101010> so your line is bad
[05:09:36] <Blondie101010> show it again
[05:11:03] <Na_Klar> yes yes it's bad. what I didn't now was that the whole line ignores fstab like pmt said, so I played around with the options and ended with a flawed line when trying the correct format as you said blondie.
[05:11:53] <Na_Klar> now it works. didn't expect it is the command in the end. Thanks PMT and Blondie101010! much appreciated.

[09:33:01] <jaggz> And this even happens with closing something small like Spectacle

[09:35:32] <jaggz> nvidia-settings seems to think it's boss (and I didn't install nouveau so I should be okay)
[09:35:53] <jaggz> and I think nvidia's stuff might blacklist nouveau to prevent complications, but I'm not sure.. could be misrecollecting something else
[09:36:01] <jaggz> okay.. so why's this darned thing so laggy
[09:36:24] <PMT> I'd probably suggest you go start a screen and run mpstat -P ALL 1 in it, then go do something that stalls out like that, and see what type of load shows up - iowait, soft, usr, sys?

[13:21:38] <Khepra> is there "opentmpfiles" available?

[13:21:53] <judd> No package named 'opentmpfiles' was found in amd64.
[13:21:54] <ayaz> Hello. I'm trying to build my understanding around LTS and ELTS. I've read Freexian and Debian pages, but I am still unclear on this. Is LTS freely available and is powered by sponsorship from third-parties, and ELTS is the only commercial offering which you have to pay for to get?
[13:22:48] <kallenp> opentmpfiles is not available in Debian 11 amd64
[13:22:58] <kallenp> any idea ? workaround ?

[13:23:31] <Khepra> btw... why do you need systemd cgroup on openrc?
[13:23:35] <jelly> why does openrc need a cgroup called ... ^
[13:24:36] <kallenp> because inside the containers I see Failed to talk to init daemon. and Failed to get D-Bus connection: Unknown error -1
[13:24:44] <kallenp> this is solution
[13:24:53] <jelly> are you running systemd inside containers, but openrc on the host?
[13:24:57] <kallenp> my old containers are debian 5, 6, 7 and 8 based
[13:25:17] <Khepra> that's terrible. you should not do that.
[13:25:20] <jelly> debian 5-6 did not have systemd
[13:25:24] <kallenp> systemd is on host, and openrc is inside containers
[13:25:55] <jelly> what kind of containers?
[13:26:03] <kallenp> OK, I will make my own systemd service
[13:26:04] <jelly> oh, lxc

[13:29:30] <jelly> ayaz, both LTS and ELTS deliverables are freely available via repos.  Both LTS and ELTS are funded with sponsorship.  For ELTS, the subset of packages supported directly depends on what paying sponsors need supported.  For LTS the LTS team kind of tries to patch everything in the distro if possible.

[13:58:44] <Khepra> Forza: I don't use mysql/mariadb, but I have a question: is the root user even intended to be used for anything other than administration?
[13:58:45] <jelly> ayaz, if your company plans to become a sponsor note that there's a fixed and a variable part of the sponsorship with ELTS; the fixed part comes from the minimum LTS sponsor level you need to even be eligible for ELTS.
[13:58:49] <PerfDave> On a fresh install you cannot run "mysql -u root" as the root user and get to a mysql prompt AFAIK. https://paste.debian.net/1215241/
[13:58:50] <jelly> ayaz, the variable part depends on how many other sponsors also pay for the same packages you use, if 5 sponsors all want dovecot patched, and there's a dovecot CVE and it gets fixed, costs for those hours are split equally.

[14:22:49] <Forza> Khepra yes
[14:23:17] <Khepra> because that one's installed by maintainer scripts of mysql-common if I'm not mistaken, so maybe you had to force confnew for mysql-common, or do the full purge of all mariadb dependencies and do a fresh reinstall
[14:23:20] <Forza> But now it still doesn't start. Journalctl says /etc/mysql/debian-start is missing
[14:24:21] <PerfDave> Forza: How did you install mariadb in the first place?
[14:24:36] <Khepra> Forza: maybe `apt remove --purge 'mariadb*'`   (careful, review the package list you get for confirmation)  and force a fresh reinstall of it
[14:25:03] <Forza> Apt install mariadb-server
[14:26:10] <PerfDave> So removing that package should have marked a load of packages as removable. "apt autoremove" should get rid of them. Then try "apt install mariadb-server" again.

[17:24:54] <DHE> as I recall recent versions of ssh can request multiple forms of authentication, such as public key + password. for traditional secret code auth with password, google authenticator has a PAM module you can use. you'll want password auth by pam (challengeresponse) as well

[17:26:01] <jelly> yes, technically that's something you have and something you know, technically
[17:26:02] <DHE> the key is a single factor. if it gets stolen, changing your password doesn't do anything and the attacker can attack the password on the key file offline
[17:26:25] <jkc> DHE: The key, unencrypted, is a single factor. The key, encrypted, is formally a multifactor cryptographic verifier.
[17:26:58] <jkc> Same concept as a smart card + PIN.
[17:27:17] <DHE> I disagree on the grounds that I should be able to change each factor independently
[17:27:38] <jkc> DHE: I wasn't asking if you agreed, I was stating a fact.
[17:27:58] <jkc> A passphrase-encrypted key is DEFINED AS a multifactor cryptographic verifier.
[17:28:19] <ansgar> jkc: It is one factor if you put the unencrypted key anywhere (like on a compromised client).
[17:28:40] <jkc> ansgar: Correct.
[17:28:53] <jkc> That's why you don't do that.

[17:29:58] <jkc> If you take the manual step of decrypting the key, something that ssh does not do on its own.
[17:30:15] <jkc> So, yes, if you take the purposeful step of removing the protection from your key, it becomes a single factor.
[17:30:17] <ansgar> I usually don't do that manually.
[17:30:28] <ansgar> It takes too much time with pen and paper.
[17:30:35] <PerfDave> Depends who's definitions we're taking. If NIST say an encrypted key (assuming suitably strong passphrase) is multifactor, I'm happy to agree with them.
[17:30:49] <jkc> PerfDave: In fact they do. NIST SP 800-63B. "A multi-factor software cryptographic authenticator is a cryptographic key stored on disk or some other "soft" media that requires activation through a second factor of authentication. Authentication is accomplished by proving possession and control of the key."

[17:46:58] <jkc> That's the requirement that NIST spells out as the recommended control for passwords. Don't force complexity rules or time-based expiry, but do check the password that a user attempts to set against a blacklist.

[18:04:31] <ede> i wanted to have distinct colorings for a grep RE. seems i'd have to pipe using different GREP_COLOR(S) for each instance. pretty sure i had such a result before, but can't even remember the context. found https://github.com/paoloantinori/hhighlighter#screenshots being an alternative, is there something like this in debian already?
[18:05:23] <queso> In the Gnome file dialog, I used to be able to type to find directories and files from the list of directories and files that are in the currently selected directory.  This no longer works.  Now when I type to search it says it's searching but never finds any useful "results".  All I really want it to do is to jump down to whatever file or directory first matches the characters I've typed.  So I resort to
[18:05:29] <queso> using the mouse, but this wastes ...
[18:05:32] <queso> ... loads of time when I'm trying to navigate deep directory structures.  Is there some way to bring back the old behavior?  This is especially painful on a laptop where my pointer device takes longer to manipulate.

[19:13:00] <greycat> Long ago, the qmail license (such as it was, since it didn't actually ship with one) prohibited distributing modified versions of qmail, so Debian wasn't allowed to ship it.  If you wanted to use it, you had to build it yourself.  Debian offered a "builder" package in contrib for a while.
[19:13:55] <kittonian> greycat, if I stick with qmail, i'll probably use sagredo's way of doing everything and just write my own Docker image

[19:15:29] <greycat> The main reason you'd use qmail today is that you already know it and are comfortable with it, and don't want to have to start from scratch learning postfix or whatever.

[19:19:37] <kittonian> greycat, right, but from what i was reading, postfix seems to offer more functionality and is properly maintained for security purposes
[19:19:50] <kittonian> i know dovecot is still the correct imap server to use
[19:20:07] <kittonian> but what about spamassassin vs rspamd?
[19:20:10] <greycat> At some point I'll probably bite the bullet and learn postfix, but I really don't want to.
[19:20:36] <PMT> for most cases, it's not that painful.
[19:20:36] <kittonian> greycat, trust me, i'm not super excited about it either, but at least it's the last piece of the puzzle to bring up this new server and ditch the old one
[19:20:57] <PMT> you can do horrific things with it if you really want to, but it's not usually necessary, and it's not reading sendmail filters.
[19:21:01] <kittonian> is there something like vpopmail for postfix or is that kind of functionality built-in?
[19:21:30] <PMT> s/filters/configs/, sorry, my mind conflated two threads at once
[19:22:38] <matik> kittonian: AFAIU it's built-in http://www.postfix.org/VIRTUAL_README.html
[19:23:05] <matik> or more precisely: http://www.postfix.org/VIRTUAL_README.html#virtual_mailbox
[19:23:18] <kittonian> that's very cool
[19:23:23] <kittonian> one less thing to do
[19:23:52] <matik> but bare in mind  that I only have a vague idea of what vpopmail does
[19:23:53] <kittonian> and i think there's even a web gui for it too so I no longer have to use the command line every time I need to add a user or an alias

[19:28:45] <PMT> Perhaps if your accounts aren't actual accounts on the machine?
[19:29:37] <greycat> that's the vpopmail model, yes
[19:29:51] <PMT> I probably just had BDB, thinking back on it.

[19:50:11] <redbrass> re: the email system discussion (sorry late to the game here)...  I used to self host my mail server.  Became too much maintenance effort to keep off the blacklists.  Was cheaper to host my mail on a third party (MXRoute.com, and just moved to Amazon WorkMail this weekend).  Suddenly I had many more hours to focus on my real job.  YMMV
[19:52:19] <PerfDave> We have a client who won't let us use Google or Amazon infra for anything to do with them, so that'd be a non starter for us. I agree it's a "nice" solution, though IME Google has a nasty habit of "acceptign" email and then blackholing it.

[19:55:42] <redbrass> kittonian: My experience is seriously outdated, so consider my comments accordingly...  I would just use Postfix vs Qmail.  I loved qmail, but in comparison postfix was maintained and qmail was not (at that point in time in the past).  I don't hear of anyone spinning up new qmail servers these days, but that is not a great measurement either.
[19:56:23] <redbrass> For dev purposes, I would use existing docker images to do the job - just to save time.  In production, I'd probably used a virtual machine rather than docker.
[19:56:57] <PMT> I heard of someone trying once recently. It attempted to rip out systemd and install sysvinit, and left them with a system they had to reinstall.
[19:57:05] <PMT> That was with the now-gone Debian package.
[19:57:48] <willow> that guide doesn't cover spf, dkim, dmarc, bind, etc.   running a mail system is pretty involved.
[19:58:25] <willow> certificate management is another issue.  dnsrobocert is one tool

[21:52:07] <greycat> In what way does "auto" fail you?  It should bring up the interface, either static or DHCP, even if there's no cable.  When the cable *is* plugged in, the interface should be immediately usable (or perhaps it may need to contact DHCP).
[21:52:14] <jamea> sorry is same Database, and 2) only run this day, i remove or comment the line after restored
[21:52:42] <greycat> If it's a one-time job, "at" is more appropriate than crontab.
[21:53:42] <Delf> auto stalls the boot process. And when it's passed stalling, it does NOT bring up the interface when cable is plugged in
[21:53:52] <greycat> So you've got it set for DHCP?
[21:54:03] <Delf> Yes
[21:54:05] <greycat> I would recommend a static setup instead.
[21:54:53] <somiaj> Also why not just run 'ifup interface' after you plug in the cable? I'm unsure what events get triggered when a cable is plugged in, unless you have some tool like network-manager keeping its eye on the device.
[21:55:45] *** Joins: ax56234 (~NickServ@user/ax562)
[21:55:52] <greycat> "it stalls the boot" is expected for a DHCP setup, as it has to try to contact DHCP, and wait for that to time out
[21:55:54] <Delf> It's a machine supposed to be connected at friends network and it's headless. They use different subnets, static ip is not an option
[21:56:09] <greycat> *multiple* different friends?
[21:56:15] <somiaj> at least for my use, manually running 'ifup interface' works for me when I plug a cable into my laptop, and since I don't mind it, never dived deeper, but I don't think a cable being plugged in triggers any kernel level/udev level events. You need some process activally monitoring the interface for that.
[21:56:24] <Delf> Multiple different friends :D

[23:43:03] <discip> hello folks! I'm seeking help
[23:43:54] <discip> I have installed on my raspberry pi 3b+ debian bullsey, using an image provided on the raspberry channel
[23:43:56] *** Joins: zykotick9 (~zykotick9@206-47-13-1.static.dsl.ncf.ca)
[23:44:05] <PMT> "the raspberry channel"?
[23:44:46] <discip> yes on this libera.chat server
[23:45:06] <PMT> that still doesn't tell me what channel or what image.
[23:45:24] <discip> ah! maybe my english is poor..
[23:45:27] <x10d> what's the problem?
[23:45:36] *** Parts: vxwarlock (~Darkcodex@user/vxwarlock) (Closing Window)
[23:45:56] <discip> an image hosted in github, I was pointed to this image by folks on raspberry channel
[23:46:18] <PMT> Also that, but I wanted to be sure they weren't running Raspbian or some random other distro before giving advice that might blow up.
[23:46:38] <matik> any chance you share the link you used discip ?
[23:46:44] <discip> I'm very rusty in linux.. this image is a bare one without desktope installed
[23:46:48] <x10d> give us that github link?
[23:46:56] <discip> yes of course!

[23:47:49] <x10d> and what's the problem with it?
[23:47:54] <discip> my current problem is that I'm not even able to onfigure the wifi connection.. :(
[23:48:09] <x10d> drivers?
[23:48:36] <discip> I'd plan to install lightdm to have something similar to raspbian

[23:50:22] <x10d> if only wlan0, so there's no drivers for wifi

[23:50:41] <discip> oh.. bad news :)
[23:50:44] <PMT> x10d: ...what?

[23:52:57] <alkisg> You want to configure wifi networking from the command line, and THEN install a desktop which will have e.g. network-manager or wicd etc?
[23:53:09] <alkisg> Wouldn't it be easier for you to install the desktop first?
[23:53:22] *** Joins: mrkz_c (uid503554@user/mrkz-c/x-7247691)
[23:53:52] <discip> I really dunno.. perhaps
[23:54:02] <x10d> how did you try to configure it?
[23:54:07] <PMT> discip: I believe if you have firmware-brcm80211 installed, you should be able to use the wireless card.
[23:54:41] <discip> x10d I added my sid and pwd into a configuration file
[23:54:55] <discip> PMT: how can I verify this?
[23:55:11] <PMT> discip: dpkg -s firmware-brcm80211
[23:56:04] <discip> bad news.. not installed
[23:56:42] <PMT> I would agree with others that it might be easier to just set it up with a GUI over the wired interface, including installing the firmware for the wireless NIC, then use the GUI to set up the wireless, rather than tinkering with the CLI utils for setting it up when you're not especially familiar with them.
[23:57:03] <x10d> try sudo apt install firmware-brcm80211
[23:57:59] *** Quits: kish` (~aqua@user/aqua) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:58:06] <discip> no network.. I got: failed to fetch http:/...
[23:58:18] <x10d> no eth connection?
[23:58:24] <discip> no :(
[23:58:30] *** Joins: kish` (~aqua@user/aqua)
[23:58:34] <PMT> I don't know that I expect the NIC to even appear in ip l if you don't have the firmware blobs...
[23:58:53] * discip is using two different computers atm
[23:59:02] <alkisg> If it's a special build for rpi, it might have the module built-in
[23:59:21] <PMT> It looks like the weird image builder installs the firmware somewhere, at least.
