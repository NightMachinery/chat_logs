[00:00:25] <f-a> https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/libraries/2021-December/031545.html wonder if I was too curt ffs I should wait before pressing ‚èé
[00:04:04] <ManofLetters[m]> you forgot all the expletives due to that hurry
[00:04:46] <f-a> https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/libraries/2021-December/031544.html I really think we should leave Show alone though
[00:05:00] <f-a> iirc the report specifies a read‚ü∑show relationshiop
[00:05:03] <f-a> -o
[01:31:46] <EvanR> "show is not for pretty printing"
[01:32:03] <EvanR> yet that is what I made it do on advent of code yesterday
[01:32:13] <EvanR> >:)

[05:25:26] <sm> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29617636 Collection of Unix ASCII Games
[05:26:38] <sm> https://universe2.us/bricktick.html, EvanR
[05:28:57] <sm> a bit like your site ic.rbow, but for terminal games only
[05:32:59] <sm> woah.. some tricky stuff going on here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnvxDk2sAZg
[05:33:31] <sm> alright that's it, I'm turning off that site so I can get stuff done
[05:33:35] <EvanR> works on windows, impressive
[05:38:43] <sm> on mac too. And fairly playable.
[05:38:59] <sm> I think we could do better though
[05:41:51] <EvanR> I simplified my overengineered machinery
[05:41:57] <EvanR> no more database
[05:42:12] <sm> whaaat
[05:43:06] <sm> actually, I'm celebrating a birthday today, so after I get stuff done I'm going back to that site and gonna play some good games
[05:43:29] <EvanR> by simply making surfaces "one way" (nothing happens if you cross them or leave them going "out") I removed the need to track and ignore select geometry
[05:43:43] <sm> that sounds wise
[05:45:16] <EvanR> dunno why DOOM doesn't work like that
[05:45:37] <EvanR> what's the point of doing IDCLIP, going outside the level, undoing IDCLIP, and being stuck out there
[05:52:31] <sm> a venzone-ish platformer: https://foon.uk/farcade/ssb/
[05:53:02] <EvanR> where are you finding all this xD
[05:56:59] <sm> that hacker news discussion I shared first
[06:00:26] <EvanR> apparently I'm using the wrong term https://github.com/Swordfish90/cool-retro-term
[06:07:15] <EvanR> https://i.imgur.com/SANBNaY.png
[06:12:15] <EvanR> if your code can't fit on 24 lines... it's too long :tm:
[06:26:06] <sm> nice term
[06:37:25] <sm> this is nice, explaining the rotation in asciiportal: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4YMYdE9xko
[07:02:25] <EvanR> i scanned ahead in that video, wondering if you caved and watched it all xD
