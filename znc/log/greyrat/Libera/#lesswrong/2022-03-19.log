[07:42:15] <Robomot> Files are fraught with peril
[07:43:04] <quanticle> >Prabhakaran et al., SOSP’05 did this and found that, for most filesystems tested, almost all write errors were dropped. The major exception to this was on ReiserFS, which did a pretty good job with all types of errors tested, but ReiserFS isn't really used today for reasons beyond the scope of this talk.
[07:43:31] <quanticle> So it's like, do filesystems really work all that well?
[07:44:11] <saturn2> they seem to be more reliable than most software of that complexity
[07:45:25] <quanticle> Maybe we should have more filesystems designed by convicted murderers
[07:46:51] <PapuaHardyNet> which convicted murderer designed a great filesystem?

[09:40:33] <rmmh> (*"2") is the ASCII value of 2, which is 50
[09:40:47] <quanticle> Ohhh
[09:40:58] <PapuaHardyNet> just to clarify, there's no primitive type for strings in C, right? only chars and array of chars
[09:41:03] <quanticle> Yep
[09:41:07] <rmmh> yup
[09:41:08] <quanticle> But an array is a pointer
[09:41:27] <quanticle> Ohhhhhh, okay, so one of the * is a multiplication and the other is a pointer deref
[09:41:33] <rmmh> also allows other nonsense like 3["hello"]
[09:41:41] <quanticle> I've done that
[09:42:12] <rmmh> there's some subtleties where arrays aren't quite pointers with decay and such but eh
[09:42:31] <rmmh> I do like composite fake operators 
[09:42:42] <quanticle> Yeah, a[3] is the same as *(a + 3 * sizeof(ptr)) IIRC
[09:42:44] <rmmh> like "goes to", -->
[09:42:56] <quanticle> Doesn't that only work for decrementing?
[09:43:10] <quanticle> 5 --> 0 works
[09:43:16] <rmmh> the multiplication by size of is implicit in the pointer arithmetic 
[09:43:33] <quanticle> But because it's a decrement you can't do 3 --> 5
[09:43:51] <quanticle> 3 --> 5 is an infinite loop

[12:22:33] <quanticle> No, Eliezer doesn't think that superintelligence is magic. A superintelligence doesn't have to be magic, it has to be 1) at our level and 2) capable of improving itself
[12:23:04] <quanticle> And (1) is arguably unnecessary if the superintelligence starts of in a place where we're not expecting a superintelligence to arise.

[12:29:24] <quanticle> many supportive comments. Scholars in touch with Chinese scientists say some are writing internal advisories on how the country could safely drop the zero-covid policy."
[12:29:26] <quanticle> One remarkable thing about the Chinese internet is that the overall tenor and number of comments on a blogpost is actually meaningful.

The researchers also looked at whether patients on ivermectin cleared the virus from their bodies faster than those who received a placebo, whether their symptoms resolved sooner, whether they were in the hospital or on

To make sure they were being thorough, the researchers analyzed the data in three different ways.

[23:01:42] <PapuaHardyNet> I've come around to agreeing that immutable data structures by default is a great feature

[23:02:22] <PapuaHardyNet> the benefits are obvious for async / concurrency, and the benefits are subtle but clear when it comes to comprehending code
[23:02:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> adiabatic: wtf
[23:03:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: Immutable data structures are great when you don't have to do anything really complicated or requiring any kind of efficiency or performance
[23:03:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or, like, track any kind of state
[23:04:06] <PapuaHardyNet> immutable data structures have such a significant reduction in performance?
[23:04:30] <PapuaHardyNet> i mean, you can simply change the reference to the new immutable object created so tracking state is not that much of an issue imo
[23:04:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> Depends on the data structure, obviously, and the use case...
[23:04:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok but
[23:04:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> Where are these references stored
[23:04:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> Perhaps in a ... data structure??
[23:05:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> And if it's immutable then how're you gonna change them?
[23:05:55] <PapuaHardyNet> well, I meant the highest level reference - the variable name
[23:07:19] <PapuaHardyNet> now you'll say that this is very wasteful - but this can be reduced by sharing references across these copies of data structures to underlying objects
[23:07:26] <PapuaHardyNet> "Pyrsistent is influenced by persistent data structures such as those found in the standard library of Clojure. The data structures are designed to share common elements through path copying. It aims at taking these concepts and make them as pythonic as possible so that they can be easily integrated into any python program without hassle." https://pyrsistent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html
[23:07:27] <Robomot> Pyrsistent — Pyrsistent 0.X.Y (moving target) documentation
[23:08:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: You gonna track everything through global variables? If not...
[23:08:33] <kuudes> you need one global variable, which is the state
[23:08:45] <kuudes> and then you run copy constructors
[23:09:08] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah you'll need at least one mutable state
[23:10:37] <kuudes> then when you change state of a thing, you make a new copy of its referree which still holds all other references the same as before; and you iterate upwards
[23:10:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> So your plan is to track state through one global state tracker variable that you then copy each time anything whatsoever changes
[23:11:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> This seems like good software design to you?
[23:11:22] <kuudes> that's how elixir iirc does that
[23:12:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> "All Elixir code runs inside lightweight threads of execution (called processes) that are isolated and exchange information via messages" ... they call their lightweight threads "processes"? rofl
[23:13:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Due to their lightweight nature, it is not uncommon to have hundreds of thousands of processes running concurrently in the same machine. Isolation allows processes to be garbage collected independently, reducing system-wide pauses, and using all machine resources as efficiently as possible (vertical scaling).
[23:13:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> Processes are also able to communicate with other processes running on different machines in the same network. This provides the foundation for distribution, allowing developers to coordinate work across multiple nodes (horizontal scaling)." ... yeah, this is definitely not confusing at all
[23:13:34] <kuudes> base stations run that or erlang iirc
[23:13:46] <kuudes> it seems indeed absurdly fast
[23:13:58] <kuudes> in low latency way
[23:14:58] <kuudes> elixir also has the "trash on error" where if there is an error during a function, it just is scrapped and next message is picked from the mailbox
[23:15:05] <kuudes> it is a weird thing
[23:15:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> Sounds bad
[23:15:17] <kuudes> it is different
[23:15:50] <kuudes> sort of like moving to gpu from cpu or something, I guess
[23:16:40] <kuudes> when writing local code, it is not that complicated, because you just deal with local state and one process
[23:17:08] <kuudes> it sort of transposes the code execution to go through those per-function mailboxes
[23:17:34] <adiabatic> Obormot\Arcturus: it works for Ericsson for all their telephony stuff, so there's probably something to it
[23:17:48] <adiabatic> (Erlang OTP style is Elixir style)
[23:18:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> I remain skeptical
[23:18:09] <kuudes> so instead of loops you do all of the loop iterations at once, parallel
[23:18:17] <kuudes> well yes, it is nontrivial
[23:18:37] <kuudes> I have started to learn it as a hobby, but still have not managed to do much
[23:19:11] <adiabatic> "So your plan is to track state through one global state tracker variable that you then copy each time anything whatsoever changes" this is React with Redux (specifically, the Redux part). I realize that this is not generally an argument in favor of the practice.
[23:19:45] <kuudes> the argument is copy is faster than synchronization, I think
[23:20:26] <adiabatic> Obormot\Arcturus: Back to Ericsson's kit, it's a system that handles hot upgrades and equipment failures, so it's probably great for what it's designed for, and Elixir makes all that way more ergonomic
[23:20:46] <adiabatic> but it sure feels weird. child process dies? eh, whatever, try again
[23:20:55] <kuudes> yeah, you can just plug new cores into machine or whatnot and it just starts to use them
[23:22:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> adiabatic: Re: React/Redux: my sentiments exactly
[23:22:33] <kuudes> it was nice demo where my friend evangelized we elixir with a web server thingy that just served results as constant http, and reacted realtime when one clicked on stuff on it
[23:22:54] <kuudes> ie the server side returned stuff in nanoseconds
[23:23:14] <kuudes> no... microseconds?
[23:23:19] <kuudes> what are 1/1000 of millis?
[23:23:23] <adiabatic> µs sounds way more likely
[23:23:29] <kuudes> yeah
[23:25:20] <adiabatic> I want to cook and eat crepes but I'm not hungry yet. what do
[23:25:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> Take a nap
[23:26:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> I am actually in that *exact* situation myself, as it happens
[23:26:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> With the crepes, etc. Literally identical
[23:26:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> And my plan is: naptime

[23:33:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> Interesting JS syntax to extend an object: 
[23:34:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> Foo = { // whatever properties and values }; Foo = { ...Foo, ...{ // additional properties and values and/or redefinitions of existing ones }};
[23:35:05] <gwern> hm. is that because the object is treated as a big hashmap/bag?
