[03:32:56] <lf94> decker: I get it now I think. You calculate the dot product, and then use some algebra against the other way to calculate a dot product to get the cos angle.
[03:33:19] <decker> ya
[03:33:30] <lf94> Which I deduced from looking at the first example here and working backwards: https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/vectors-dot-product.html
[03:33:33] <decker> there's problably a more direct relationship through sqrt(1-dot)
[03:33:58] <dauggy> Guys I'm wondering do you even see my messages?
[03:34:05] <decker> ya- but I'm using arcsin instead of arccos
[03:34:13] <decker> so it's 90 degrees offset
[03:34:36] <decker> dauggy sorry I don't know I promised not to answer linear algebra questions
[03:35:00] <dauggy> decker: thanks, this is calculus actauly :D
[03:35:12] <lf94> I don't understand how you're getting that angle on the one side of the red line
[03:35:47] <lf94> So we have angle TPaPb - how do you determine how to divide that?
[03:36:07] <decker> dauggy https://www.geogebra.org/3d you can use this and use x/y instead of x/n
[03:36:35] <decker> lf94 that's a theorum...  because aa+bb=cc - it's a right trigangle...
[03:36:46] <decker> and points on a circle are always xx+yy=CC
[03:36:55] <lf94> Ah! ok
[03:38:11] <lf94> Oooooh I understand now
[03:38:22] <lf94> You subtract 90 from angle TPaPb right?
[03:38:52] <lf94> (You've probably already said this in some form, but I'm "seeing" it now in the diagram)
[03:39:56] <decker> I don't in the arcsin version... 0 degrees would be perpendicular; if you use arccos then you have to subtract 90 degrees
[03:40:09] <decker> because a projetion of perpendiculars is 0
[03:40:24] <decker> a projection of parallel directions is 1 or -1
[03:40:36] <decker> and all the sin/cos's inbetween on a unit vector

[05:37:46] <lf94> (I set d arbitrarily to 2 just so you can see where it's supposed to line up with)
[05:38:59] <lf94> So my whole issue here was the fact I didn't know how to calculate the angle using dot product. I swear, dot products are a mystery to me. It seems they are used for so many things but at "random" (not true obviously, but that's what it looks like to me)

[05:40:59] <decker> haha :) somehwat.  the other fix for the direction problem is the cross product gives you a vector above or below the plane depending on the angle, which tells you which side it should be on (?)

[06:01:06] <lf94> I would have never been able to do this alone. I was lucky with the math calculating the radius for the sagitta arc and radius arc circles, but this one was beyond me because of the dot product.

[16:55:50] <Z-module> zincy: your A_1 and A_2 are both open in X already (since each is of the form X cap U where U is open in R^2), and nonempty and disjoint and their union is X. So X is disconnected. That's all it is.
[16:57:50] <zincy> Z-module: Thanks
[16:58:55] <zincy> Is the topology the subspace topology here (implicit I guess)
[16:59:59] <Z-module> Yes, any time they talk about some subset of R^n and don't specify, assume subspace topology.  ... But if A_1 is the *closed* disk (but not A_2), you wanted to see whether A_1 cup A_2 is still disconnected? That space is actually connected.
[17:00:28] <Z-module> Even path-connected.
[17:01:06] <zincy> Oh so the closure of A_1 would not be subspace clopen

[17:05:33] <Z-module> It is subspace-closed and not subspace-open because, as the closed disk that includes (0,0) on its boundary, there is no plane-open U where  X cap U = A_1   since that would mean (0,0) is in U, but then so are all points (t,0) for t < 0 and close enough to 0,   X cap U  would include these points too, which are not in the closed disk A_1.

[17:19:40] <zincy> Z-module: From what I can see the cl(A_1) U A_2  is connected because we cannot find two *open* disjoint subsets since we have to expand the cl(A_1) a little bit to get an open set
[17:19:58] <zincy> and then we are including points from A_2 so fails to be disjoint
[17:20:11] <decker> I don't know what else to offer - the rest is just algebra... but converting to 0y=1x+3 is confusing from x=-3 so... I don't knowA1 in your example though isn't just the slope... what you'd have is 1/0 which makes it harder I suppose.. -0/1 would be the other direction

[17:37:10] <paul424> yeah , here most of the time the lines are in the form y = ax +b

[20:23:21] <Klinda> I ask to google
[20:23:37] <greenbagels> Klinda: ok well the short answer is, based on how matrix multiplication is defined, if you interpret theta transpose as a row vector and x as a column vector, you get your sum back out

[20:25:02] <greenbagels> (Though it seems odd that you would recognize the symbol for transpose without knowing the details of matrix multiplication)
[20:25:17] <greenbagels> Klinda: theta is, but transposing switches it to a row vector
[20:25:27] <isekaijin> johnkeats6: So we take X x Y and then collapse each orbit of “g . (x,y) = (g.x, g.y)”?
[20:25:29] <greenbagels> Because the columns become rows and vice versa
[20:25:58] <Klinda> greenbagels: not true theta is a row vector and x is a row vector too

[21:30:58] <Z-module> Franciman: another nice non-first-countable space is R (the usual real line) but with all points of N = {1,2,...} identified to a single point, call this space X. Let pi: R -> X be the projection for this. Then if {U_1, U_2, ...} is any countable set of X-open nbhds of the point pi(N), each U_n has all the points of some punctured interval  (n - eps_n, n + eps_n) \ {n}   as a subset. So now the X-open set  pi( cup_n (n - (eps_n)/2, (n +
[21:30:58] <Z-module> eps(n)/2)) )  does not have any single U_n entirely as a subset. So the point pi(N) in X has no countable local base.

[22:20:09] <Guest78> oh it is, but I just dont...dont understand why
[22:20:58] <isekaijin> Let's try to reason about what 2uu^t means.
[22:21:10] <isekaijin> Clearly, 2uu^t is a symmetric matrix of rank 1.
[22:21:19] <Guest78> uhm. Wait
[22:21:30] <Guest78> u is a vector and u^T its transpose
[22:21:33] <isekaijin> Yes.
[22:21:45] <isekaijin> So uu^t is a symmetric matrix of rank 1.
[22:21:46] <Guest78> so like the letter "L" I imagine what the product looks like
[22:21:55] <isekaijin> I am not sure what you are denoting by L.
[22:22:21] <Guest78> u is a "tall" matrix and since u^T is the transpose then...then its laying on its side. I"m just visualizing the vectors
[22:22:39] <isekaijin> Oh, so u is not just a single vector?
[22:22:53] <Guest78> uh
[22:23:02] <Guest78> let me find it in the book
[22:23:15] <isekaijin> Okay, if u is a “tall” matrix of full rank, then 2uu^t is a symmetric matrix whose rank is equal to that of u.

[22:34:24] <Guest78> Here S1 = range(P) and S2 = null(P), by the way. That was defined earlier in the book
[22:34:33] <isekaijin> Guest78: If u is a unit vector, then, after an orthogonal transformation (which preserves vector lengths), you may assume that u is one of the standard basis vectors of R^n.
[22:36:06] <isekaijin> Guest78: So your original question reduces to “what is the geometric meaning of I - 2uu^t”, where u = (1,0,...,0).
[22:36:36] <isekaijin> But, of course, uu^t = diag(1,0,...,0).
[22:37:20] <isekaijin> So 1 - 2uu^t = diag(-1,1,...,1).
[22:37:48] <isekaijin> Which gives the geometric interpretation that johnkeats6 gave.

[22:38:14] <Guest78> i meant: "mm." haha

[23:21:41] <isekaijin> Guest78: How are you defining “multidegree” here?
[23:21:57] <isekaijin> Is it just the tuple of degrees in each separate variable?
[23:22:11] <isekaijin> (Considering the other variables as constants.)
[23:23:34] <isekaijin> Mmm, no, this does not seem right.
[23:24:37] <isekaijin> I am guessing that LM and LT mean “leading monomial” and “leading term”, respectively, in which case the order of the terms is relevant.
[23:25:04] <Guest78> https://i.imgur.com/1HrQXp4.png
[23:25:17] <Guest78> so its the tuple of the leading monomial
[23:25:21] <isekaijin> In any case, I know nothing about Gröbner bases.
[23:25:35] <Guest78> you dont have to about grobner bases. Just leading terms

[23:26:08] <Guest78> (grobner bases are just particular bases of an ideal. They're really nice)
[23:26:19] <isekaijin> In the definition of multidegree, “max” is w.r.t. the chosen monomial order, right?

[23:28:49] <Guest78> this is just following the definition, but I don't understand what they mean about the leading terms cancelling. Do they mean LT(f) and LT(g) are not expressed explicitly in S(f,g)? Or do they mean LT(S) is neither LT(f) or LT(g)
[23:29:05] <isekaijin> Oh, koay.
[23:29:07] <isekaijin> okay*
[23:29:11] <APic> Hi jellydonut.
[23:29:12] <isekaijin> Now it makes sense to me.
[23:30:24] <Guest78> I think its the latter
[23:30:31] <isekaijin> Guest78: What we have is S(f,g) = pf - qg, where p and q are cooked so that pf and qg will have the same leading term.
[23:30:55] <isekaijin> This ensures that these leading terms cancel in the difference pf - qg.
[23:31:00] <isekaijin> cancel each other*

[23:31:25] <isekaijin> From this definition, I see no way to predict what LT(S) could possibly be.
[23:31:53] <isekaijin> Considering that p and q are not even constants, S(f,g) might even end up having larger degree than the original polynomials f and g.
