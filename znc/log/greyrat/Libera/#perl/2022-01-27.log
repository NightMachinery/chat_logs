[00:52:04] <Guest19> I am a Java developer . One of my application is in perl script that just getting the data and inserting to DB .  I try to call Java API from perl to pass the data to avoid the direct DB contact due to security reasons . Is there a way to call Java from perl to send the data ?

[00:53:24] <sivoais> Guest19: yes, Inline::Java
[00:53:40] <Grinnz> there is https://metacpan.org/pod/Inline::Java but consider just making a java executable or service that the perl script can call
[00:53:40] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ Inline::Java - metacpan.org ]
[00:54:40] <Grinnz> Botje: technically, <> reads from all files in @ARGV *or* from STDIN, never both
[00:55:18] <Grinnz> and yes, it effectively passes the script's args to 2-arg open, which is why <<>> exists
[00:55:56] <choroba> never both: unless you specify - as one of the files :)
[00:56:15] <Grinnz> which is a side effect of 2 arg open so unfortunately doesn't work with <<>>

[06:34:19] <FlorianBad> How would I go about implementing xchacha20-poly1305 in perl?
[06:34:59] <FlorianBad> I could call age ( https://github.com/FiloSottile/age ) but I'd rather not rely on executing another binary

[06:40:29] <aquanight> if you can't find a library that already implements the algorithm, the next step would be to review the spec and see what operations are needed
[06:41:51] <FlorianBad> aquanight: so you would look at the source for example and code your own implementation?  That sounds like a lot at first but I don't know after all
[06:41:54] <tirnanog> how about this? https://metacpan.org/pod/Crypt::AuthEnc::ChaCha20Poly1305
[06:41:54] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ Crypt::AuthEnc::ChaCha20Poly1305 - Authenticated encryption in ChaCha20-Poly1305 mode - metacpan.org ]
[06:41:56] <x5c30> FlorianBad: libsodium is nice, there's Crypt::NaCl::Sodium but it's old, genio is working on a ffi implementation (Sodium::FFI), and i'm likely to release yet another soon (implementation is already done)
[06:42:17] <x5c30> there are a couple other minimal packages that probably do at least that much
[06:42:26] *** Quits: Markow (~Markow@176.122.215.103) (Quit: Leaving)
[06:42:31] <x5c30> something something ::Nitrate but i didn't look at it too far
[06:43:06] <FlorianBad> tirnanog: wow, didn't see this one, I wonder why it didn't come up! thanks
[06:43:57] <FlorianBad> x5c30: ok, I'll be very interested
[06:44:11] <tirnanog> so would I. libsodium is good.
[06:44:36] *** Joins: jx0 (~jx0@199.229.250.46)
[06:44:51] <x5c30> cool, i expect to have something up by the weekend
[06:47:48] <FlorianBad> x5c30: just so I get it right, it will be chacha20-poly1305 in a non-chacha specific library (Sodium::FFI) that also happens to handle that cipher, correct?
[06:48:05] *** Quits: pucara (~i@host14.181-1-101.telecom.net.ar) (Quit: Lost terminal)
[06:48:20] <x5c30> right. libsodium is a whole lot more than just that
[06:49:13] <FlorianBad> ok, that's awesome. BTW I still haven't figured out what's the difference between xchacha20 (extended) and chacha20... so I still write those interchangeably
[06:49:49] <x5c30> with the x has a bigger nonce so you can be ok with random nonces
[06:49:59] <x5c30> regular chacha20 you want incrementing to avoid re-using a nonce
[06:51:02] *** Quits: EvanCarroll (~ecarroll@50.222.187.218) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[06:51:07] <FlorianBad> so you're talking about the security implications of how random the IV is?
[06:51:37] <x5c30> it doesn't really have to be random at all, nor private...it's just a matter of never, ever use the same nonce twice
[06:51:42] *** Joins: jmdaemon (~jmdaemon@user/jmdaemon)
[06:51:51] <x5c30> and with a bigger nonce there's much lower risk of random values having a collision
[06:53:04] <FlorianBad> ok. I'm actually writing a bunch of backup scripts, like a little toolbox to make very large tgz backups and store them online as well as burn them on 100GB M-DISCS, and I'm using Argon2 with a random salt every time, salt that will be saved as a header in the output encrypted file, so I could just use the salt as the IV?
[06:54:13] <x5c30> for xchacha20 yeah, for regular chacha20 best not to do that
[06:55:49] <FlorianBad> hmm
[06:56:58] <FlorianBad> but it will always be random (meaning extremely likely unique) so what's the problem if that's also used as salt? Both will have to be saved as headers in the encrypted file anyway, right?
[06:57:37] *** Quits: proller (~p@2a02:6b8:b081:8832::1:8) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[06:57:50] <x5c30> yup and both can be public, the risk is of accidentally re-using the nonce which with chacha20 is only 64 bit
[06:58:05] *** Joins: EvanCarroll (~ecarroll@67-200-246-226.static.logixcom.net)
[06:58:13] <FlorianBad> hmm, well but I won
[06:58:42] <FlorianBad> won't store a db of them, so there is still 64 bits of probabilities of reusing the same
[06:59:13] <FlorianBad> ah, unless I use time or something like that that is guaranteed to be unique
[07:00:52] <xenu> a new release of cpanm, shocking
[07:01:04] <xenu> sadly it's just a minor cve fix, not cpanm 2
[07:01:59] <ology> What would you like in a v2?
[07:03:00] <x5c30> time is kinda-hopefully unique, until you decide to have multiple processes, multiple systems, somewhere down the line it might come back to bite...your stuff, your rules, do what you're comfy with :) best practices are good randomness in xchacha20, or always incrementing the nonce to prevent re-use with chacha20
[07:03:04] * ology looks at https://github.com/miyagawa/cpanminus/issues
[07:03:34] <xenu> ology: cpanm 2.0 is a rewrite on top of Menlo
[07:03:49] <xenu> anyway, what the feature i miss the most in cpanm is static install
[07:04:18] <xenu> or whatever it was called
[07:04:27] <xenu> basically installation of modules without calling Makefile.PL/Build.PL

[07:49:39] <FlorianBad> x5c30: well, this is a command-line backup tool that can only be used in terminal because there is user input for PWD, so time is actually very good, esp if combined with pid and a bit of random on top of that if there are enough bits

[17:59:22] <SpiceMan> Altreus: around 2019 I had to move a project from 2009 from an old centos 5 server to a new server. The codebase was backend in perl, frontend in php. 
[17:59:54] <Altreus> nothing here is right
[18:00:33] <SpiceMan> with php my options were rewrite everything in a newer php or compile an old php by hand and all its dependencies (went with the latter and it was pretty hell, because I also had to make it work with apache)

[21:25:54] <Macwinner> Hi, what do people typically use for try/catch semantics? Our code base currently uses TryCatch.  I'm checking on Nice::Try and Try::Tiny
[21:26:06] <LeoNerd> perlbot: try
[21:26:06] <perlbot> LeoNerd: https://p3rl.org/Syntax::Keyword::Try or https://p3rl.org/Feature::Compat::Try or https://p3rl.org/Try::Tiny | Try things before asking about them. See also TIAS | http://mvp.kablamo.org/cpan/exceptions/
[21:26:09] <Macwinner> Nice::Try seems to behave the clearest to me in my limited testing
[21:26:17] <LeoNerd> core perl has try/catch now also
[21:26:23] <Mandevil> Fature::Try::Compat++
[21:26:31] <LeoNerd> If you use Syntax::Keyword::Try (or the Feature::Compat::Try wrapper) that's the same as core's one
[21:26:38] <Mandevil> Well, Feature::Compat::Try :)
[21:26:52] <ilmari> eww, Nice::Try is a source filter
[21:26:53] <LeoNerd> And furthermore, Feature::Compat::Try just enables the core syntax if the perl is new enough
[21:27:05] <LeoNerd> ilmari: Yeah, it isn't very.. nice
[21:27:11] *** Joins: fwg (~fwg@user/fwg)
[21:27:21] <Mandevil> LeoNerd: New enough? Like.. in the future?
[21:27:24] <Macwinner> interesting that Nice::Try isn't on the radar
[21:27:36] <LeoNerd> Mandevil: 5.34 currently.
[21:27:45] <LeoNerd> Though once 5.36 is out I'll add the 'finally' part to it, so it'll require that
[21:27:52] <Mandevil> Alright
[21:28:04] <LeoNerd> The idea with a Feature::Compat::* module is that it tracks latest stable release of perl
[21:28:35] <Macwinner> ilmari: sorry, what's the gist of the issue with source filter? I didn't quite understand

[21:29:03] <ilmari> Macwinner: it parses the code and turns it into some other code
[21:29:14] <ilmari> wihch is extremely hard to get right, and hard to debug when it goes wrong

[21:45:30] <ether> TryCatch uses Devel::Declare which should be avoided whenever possible
