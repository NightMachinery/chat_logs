[00:05:39] <InPhase> pyzozord: For point of reference, in the past week or two of work I've run about 5 or 6 different builds of a mac program written by someone remote, on the mac on my work desk, and not one of them would have passed a smoke test yet.  It's not really the other programmer's fault, it's just that it's hard to trust a build until you've done some basic testing or have the tricky parts really stabilized.
[00:05:47] <pyzozord> it's notion of object is much more aligned with Alan Kay's idea of object oriented programming, then C++'s
[00:07:14] <GeDaMo> They inherited Objective C from NextStep

[00:20:29] <GeDaMo> This has a nice railroad diagram :P https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier#Syntax
[00:20:32] <epolanski> this is interesting so suppose a request is UNSUPPORTED_METHOD on /notfoundresource, I should return a method not allowed rather than a 404?
[00:21:30] <deniska> not sure if it matters much, but I guess most systems would return 404

[00:23:39] <epolanski> that's why I was thinking path should come before method, and actually I guess even before should come the protocol (if only one is supported, which is typical, e.g.)
[00:24:37] <deniska> epolanski: in a typical web application you'll have multiple layers examining http request data in turn
[00:25:00] <deniska> epolanski: so it's just whatever layer decides first to respond with which code
[00:25:27] <Decker> method is outside of the url
[00:25:30] <epolanski> yeah, but I'm the one writing the web application, thus I'm the one who decides in which order to parse the requests and was wondering if there were rules or conventions
[00:25:36] <Decker> protocol is in the url...

[00:31:01] <deniska> epolanski: but then a client requests POST /things/123, you know about /things, you can POST to thing, but then a thing 123 doesn't exist, 404 etc
[00:31:04] <epolanski> reading the comments here it seems like it is up to the server to decide
[00:31:06] <epolanski> An origin server might be provided with, or be capable of generating, multiple representations that are each intended to reflect the current state of a target resource. In such cases, some algorithm is used by the origin server to select one of those representations as most applicable to a given request, usually based on content negotiation.

[07:22:44] <PlanckWalk> I've certainly never used a TActionList in Lazarus.

[07:24:38] *** Quits: woggle (~charles@c-va-26578d734e-1840-1.tingfiber.com) (Quit: WeeChat 2.8)
[07:25:05] <Arahael> Essentially in Delphi (and presumeably Lazarus) dev, the IDE serializes the UI Form into a text representation (which people rarely read directly), and some of these components when directly used in such a form will have integration with the IDE so you can use the mouse to edit those listings, etc.  But the concepts are general.
[07:26:12] <PlanckWalk> I was expecting something along the lines of "List of actions to be applied to a model", which is pretty common.
[07:26:27] <PlanckWalk> E.g. for implementing Undo functionality
[07:27:21] <Arahael> PlanckWalk: Ah, these are more of use with an event system, such as "when you do this... Trigger that", and is is often used together with a pull down menu.  Which is why they contain a TImageList as well so that you can provide it with an icon to click on.
[07:27:26] <PlanckWalk> But I guess "action" is a pretty broad term, and "list" can cover just about any way to store more than one of them.
[07:27:30] <Arahael> Yeah.

[07:53:47] <Izem> seems pretty fast too
[07:54:09] <AlexDelarge> only problem with turbo pascal was that borland added certain things like kbhit() to make it easier -- things that weren't part of the language
[07:55:03] <Izem> nonstandard extensions never stopped anyone :P
[07:55:30] <Arahael> FPC and Delphi both added their own stuff to the language.  FPC tries to maintain Delphi compoatibility though, to varying degrees of success.
[07:55:58] <AlexDelarge> no, but when i tried to use them on the univ mainframe i had to re-write bits of my code :P

[09:52:39] <Arahael> blahboybaz: What language?  Somehow, I'm guessing it's javascript. That's Very Javascript.
[09:52:53] <eyynet4> if "this" is undefined i don't know, that sounds like a bad situation

[09:57:01] <Arahael> blahboybaz: "this" is probably not what you expect.  In javascript, it matters /how/ you call it.
[09:57:18] * Arahael does not like javascript.

[10:01:34] <blahboybaz> Yeah, the line that calls the methos is the culprit but I don't get why it would cause that to happen
[10:01:54] <blahboybaz> Is it in the codebase (an error in the method itself)?
[10:02:38] <eyynet4> that is the question, why is the thing not defined
[10:03:18] <Arahael> blahboybaz: The class was perhaps instantiated differently?
[10:03:24] <blahboybaz> eyynet4: According to jest it is defined..
[10:03:37] <blahboybaz> Arahael: perhaps
[10:03:44] <eyynet4> is that an alternate runtime?
[10:04:27] <Arahael> blahboybaz: See this and be sad: https://betterprogramming.pub/understanding-the-this-keyword-in-javascript-cb76d4c7c5e8
[10:04:34] <eyynet4> is there a prize if we guess right?
[10:04:42] <deniska> blahboybaz: the language tries to evaluate `this.head.next`, it has no idea that this expression is inside a condition
[10:05:01] <deniska> blahboybaz: and `if` doesn't have a magical ability to suppress exceptions
[10:05:21] <deniska> I am not aware about any language which would do tat
[10:05:23] <deniska> that*
[10:05:45] * Arahael whispers in deniska's ears: "Haskell's Monads do."
[10:06:00] <blahboybaz> Yeah but an evaluation of "undefined" should be the same a falsey shouldn't it? And the conditional should still respond accordingly to a falsey condition

[10:06:41] <Arahael> blahboybaz: That would be true if it was just `if (this.head)`, but you're doing `if (this.head.node)`
[10:06:42] <eyynet4> undefined means something is not working right
[10:07:02] <blahboybaz> But in this case there is a node at the position as well as one after it (known to be there)

Real appreciate the feedback
[10:11:02] <deniska> Arahael: haskell gained exceptions while I wasn't looking? :P
[10:11:48] <Arahael> deniska: It's had them for ages.  But the do-notation in monads tends to show the happy path, exceptions essentially just short-circuit or something, and that includes the Maybe monad.
[10:12:32] <deniska> Arahael: this is not exceptions, it's just a fancy syntax for chaining expressions of fancy return types
[10:12:35] <Arahael> deniska: So you can do things like: do foo <- getFoo; bar <- getBar; baz <- getBaz; return foo * bar * baz;
[10:12:59] <Arahael> deniska: And if any of those steps causes a 'problem', as defined by that monad, it can automatically just return a reasonable default, such as Nothing.
[10:13:21] <blahboybaz> Found the problem (thanks for the help).. but I still don't get why it was a problem. It seems to me that the way the code was written before refactoring just now should have worked.

[13:20:23] <merijn> Arahael: Why do you need to know those, besides when first generating it?
[13:20:33] <Arahael> merijn: Because the website is crap.

[16:19:14] <mrig> outsourcing is usually a 'business smell' in my experience, leads to nasty practices in which everyone passes the buck and the lower down in the chain you are the more you get crapped upon.
[16:19:22] <pyzozord> Rashad: oh then the difference is just 50 bucks. In that case go with the one you like more. Think about it that way: are you willing to pay 50 more/less for something that you look at every day?
[16:19:58] <Rashad> pyzozord The difference is actually $250
[16:20:11] <pyzozord> Rashad: geez, you are not making this easy :D
[16:21:09] <pyzozord> Rashad: no the difference in what you save is just 50, right? You wanted an Air but stopped when you realized you can save 200 on the pro, but if you are already saving 150 on the air, then the difference in potential savings is just 50
[16:22:20] <pyzozord> Rashad: I would ignore that 50 saving thing and worry more if you want air/pro and can you afford $850/$1100 to pay. Consider the lifetime of the device will be 5 years or 10 if you are taking care of it

[18:10:06] <iji> Similar to this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50480781
[18:10:46] <iji> However adding custom view after the parent has been created does not work, as I already said.
[18:11:01] <iji> *does not seem to work
[18:12:26] <mrig> seems that the way that these different classes are displaying in the view window is different, which will essentially be why they are displayed in one and not in the other.

[18:17:57] <Guest17> Nice to see you again.
[18:18:27] <iji> I don't think they are differently displayed by the dialog, AlertDialog just uses View which is an interface so it should be View-agnostic.

[20:41:47] <pyzozord> mrig: that is not python, what is it? Itsn't that go?
[20:41:58] <mrig> the last and out booleans are allowing the parseToken function to consume the look ahead token.
[20:42:04] <mrig> pyzozord: thats go code.
[20:42:07] <dracula> mrig: is this due to the language? i read an article on lobste.rs which mentioned the DRY violations in Go.
[20:42:52] <pyzozord> dracula: go has a philosophy of "little copy is better then little dependency"
[20:42:58] <mrig> No nothing to do with the language, it is parsing a stream of anything and how to deal with lookahead, I suppose I need to place a stack in there.
[20:43:01] <dracula> s/then/than/
[20:43:05] <pyzozord> revolutionary idea, it really blew my mind when I learned it
[20:43:29] <mrig> in fact that is probably my answer right ther.
[20:43:48] <mrig> dracula: what are DRY violations?
[20:44:09] *** Joins: pavonia (~user@user/siracusa)
[20:44:11] <dracula> mrig: some people claim Go makes them write repetitive code, etc.
[20:44:14] <mrig> I need a stack and then I can check on the length of the stack.
[20:44:20] <dracula> mrig: DRY = don't repeat yourself.
[20:44:32] <mrig> dracula: I like writing repetitive code, that is how I master coding.
[20:45:09] <mrig> Then I end up thinking in the appropriate way, and eventually just write without even needing to think.
[20:45:12] <dracula> mrig: it's a personal choice.
[20:45:21] <mrig> sure yes, also learning styles.
[20:46:12] <mrig> duck debugging, ask a question and think of the answer whilst writing the question :)
[20:47:00] <dracula> mrig: so, you probably didn't like the *i++ level array traversal and while ( (c = getchar()) != EOF ) stuff they did in K & R?
[20:47:32] <mrig> sure yes
[20:47:44] <dracula> mrig: so, no.
[20:47:53] <mrig> why do you say that?
[20:48:27] <dracula> mrig: if someone asks a question in English like "did you not like it?" and you didn't like it, the unambiguous answer is "no".
[20:48:29] <mrig> I thought of my calculator from K n R actually whilst thinking how to get rid of the sill boolans in this code.

[20:58:48] <mrig> pyzozord: the thing is that I am wanting to offset the token by one, figured that putting a small stack inside the parser object is going to be the best way, then I can escape the loop when it is empty, and not seek more tokens once the EOF bell has been rung.
[20:58:50] <entuland> dracula, nice, you should just need greasemonkey or something to do that then
[20:58:59] <dracula> entuland: no.
[20:59:01] <esxloc> dracula why is that?
[20:59:07] <dracula> entuland: it's just one userChrome.js.
[20:59:16] <esxloc> dracula android development is considered gui-development?
[20:59:18] <entuland> okay
[20:59:23] <dracula> entuland: no Greasemonkey. i wanted to do this without an extension.
[20:59:51] <entuland> okay
[20:59:52] <dracula> entuland: only old geezers hang out in IRC. it's not cool anymore. maybe try StackOverflow.
[21:00:09] <mrig> dracula: lisp would likely be the way to go. The grammar is about 4000 lines of code.
[21:00:13] <pyzozord> mrig: not sure what do you mean. My example breaks as soon as it sees eof, and for any other error it will just print it and ignore it and move on to the next token
[21:00:20] <esxloc> notice dracula i am neither on slack nor on discord
[21:00:26] <entuland> didn't see that one coming, but okay
[21:00:36] <dracula> entuland: thanks for not telling me to fuck-off with a reference to XY problem. you were very patient with this.

[21:01:22] <entuland> ah now I see :P
[21:01:24] <mrig> pyzozord: Yes thats the thing, you cant see it there but in the parseToken function there is currently some code that is holding back a token for one iteration, I should have mentioned that, and it is also really horrible to hide code like this.
[21:01:42] <AlexDelarge> nice one dracula
[21:01:45] <mrig> why I was wondering what a commons solution to offsetting by one might be.

[21:02:54] <pyzozord> mrig: why is parseToken holding back one token?
[21:03:22] <mrig> pyzozord: so that I can deal with the case of xml elements nesting.
[21:03:26] <dracula> entuland: anyway. i had solved it some time ago and was looking for you to tell that the problem is solved.
[21:03:51] <pyzozord> mrig: meaning "see if last token was a parent"?
[21:03:51] <mrig> I need to know whether the token that follows is the closing token or not.
[21:04:12] <dracula> mrig: but Perl is the one in which you'd parse it.
[21:04:17] <mrig> well I am building the tree so there are no parents as such yet, just a stream of tokens.

[22:03:39] <Guest9> i would like to know which are different available solution to deal with this problem Rashad
[22:03:45] <Rashad> I think Elasticsearch can do it out of the box
[22:03:51] <Rashad> -- the scenario you were talking about
[22:04:11] <Rashad> and it gives you a percentage for how much of a good match the word is
[22:04:26] <Guest9> i see, but in my case i think anvil.works datatable doesnt have that much advanced feature like elasticsearch
[22:04:47] <pyzozord> Guest278: sorry I don't think I can help at the moment. You can also ask in #bash
