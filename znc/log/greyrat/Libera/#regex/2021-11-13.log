[00:03:22] <OnlineCop> AP0LL0: Regex names are pretty much fixed, so you can't rename the _regex pattern_ names; however, your key will be stored in `$1` and the value in `$2`, so you could always just do that in your substitution: `"$1": "$2"`, etc.

[00:06:25] <AP0LL0> OnlineCop if the text is &is_retargeting=false&app_id=com.rocketplay.luckyplay& then there should be a group named is_retargeting and value false and another group app_id with value com.rocketplay.luckyplay
[00:07:27] <re101-bongo-51> hi. If I have the following string "Last control unmapped by {1} on {0} - {Bank} {1break it} {accou-|/?nts}, {balances} and 12315615transactions are fictitious" and I want to select everything between braces except braces that contain one number (ie {0}). How can I do that? My end result would have {Bank}Â  {1break it} {accou-|/?nts} {balances} all
[00:07:28] <re101-bongo-51> selected
[00:07:28] <OnlineCop> I get that, but do you mean a regex group named `is_retargeting`, or do you mean some JSON output text with the key as `is_retargeting`?
[00:08:47] <AP0LL0> regex group named
[00:08:47] <re101-bongo-51> I have something like this ({)([^0-9}]+)(}). But if fails on spaces if the string has a number in it
[00:09:21] <OnlineCop> AP0LL0: I don't know of an easy way to do that, no.
[00:09:41] <OnlineCop> re101-bongo-51: Have you got an example on regex101 already?
[00:09:42] <AP0LL0> very well, thank you
[00:10:27] <OnlineCop> re101-bongo-51: What if you change the `+` to `{2,}` ?

[00:11:15] <OnlineCop> re101-bongo-51: https://regex101.com/r/uaqa6t/1 maybe?
[00:11:41] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/TYVEKi/2
[00:12:05] <re101-bongo-51> {2,} does not change anything
[00:12:20] <OnlineCop> Did you notice that it was [^{}] before the {2,} ?
[00:12:28] <OnlineCop> So "match anything except these two characters"
[00:12:30] <re101-bongo-51> I guess I did it wrong
[00:12:34] <re101-bongo-51> but I see yours works
[00:12:49] <re101-bongo-51> Thank you so much!
[00:12:52] <OnlineCop> Is it possible that you could run into escaped  \{  or  \}  ?
[00:13:01] <re101-bongo-51> probably not
[00:13:09] <re101-bongo-51> we just have users making crazy data sometimes
[00:13:31] <OnlineCop> If so, you may need one extra step to just match \ followed by "whatever character" comes immediately after it.

[18:55:06] <mingdao> I'm not good at this at all.  I need to find if the SIP Peers listed (10.30.1.5, 10.30.1.8, 10.30.1.9) ever show up in any of /var/log/*.  I do have some specific ones, exp /var/log/e911/e911.log
[18:55:10] <mingdao> grep -E -o '(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\.(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\.(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\.(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)' /var/log/e911/e911.log > SIPPeers
[18:55:14] <mingdao> Then `grep 10.30.1 SIPPeers` shows me there are not entries for 10.30.1, but I should be able to do this in one search.
[18:55:31] <mingdao> s/not/no

[19:05:48] <VectorX> i've spent the last 4 minutes trying to figure out how you missed the closing ], i give up
[19:06:07] <VectorX> best I came up with, maybe lack of sleep
[19:06:20] <digitok> wut
[19:06:27] <digitok> i fixed it -_-
[19:06:39] <VectorX> but typo is up there
[19:07:07] <VectorX> i know you fixed it, but how did it happen in the first place was the question
[19:07:09] <VectorX> ;)
[19:07:57] <digitok> how does any typo happen :(
[19:08:11] <VectorX> thats where the lack of sleep might have come in
[19:08:18] <VectorX> ok ok, so what was it
[19:09:17] <mingdao> digitok: Thank you!
[19:09:31] <digitok> :) yw
[19:11:01] <mingdao> digitok: sudo grep -E -o -r '\b10\.30\.1\.[0-9]{1,3}\b' /var/log/      tells me the customer is not using any of those SIP Peers.
[19:11:17] <mingdao> We had a strange thing happen, which I think is bad reporting on the part of the customer.
[19:12:09] <digitok> i see
[19:13:31] <mingdao> We tested SMS calls with all 5 SIP Peers configured.  Those 3 plus 2 MSRP configured with 64.58.61. public IPs.
[19:13:54] <mingdao> They successfully completed a SMS call.
[19:14:14] <mingdao> The next day the director asked me to remove ALL the SIP Peers, because he said they're not using them.
[19:14:32] <mingdao> I removed the 3 with the private IPs, but not the 2 with the public IPs.
[19:15:04] <mingdao> A couple of days later they said they could not handle SMS calls, that the Telco routed them to another location in another State.
[19:15:29] <mingdao> We did not test, but added the 3 Peers back with the private IPs, and they made a successful call.
[19:15:58] <mingdao> I just don't see those 3 SIP Peers using the private IPs showing up ever, and they aren't showing in the log of the successful call.
[19:17:10] <mingdao> Just one of the public IPs.
[19:17:29] <mingdao> At least you have helped me with a more successful search.
[19:18:36] <digitok> sounds like fun, glad i could help :p
[19:19:59] <VectorX> mingdao thats crazy that you are accommodating a customer request at that level
[19:20:17] <VectorX> must be a big client
[19:23:47] <mingdao> VectorX: I configure software and hardware for NG-911 customers.  The company I work for has the #1 and #2 products.  We replaced 94 pieces of hardware for this customer, and it all has to work as it did prior to the Hardware Refresh.  This is a large customer, but we do the same for them all.
[19:24:12] <VectorX> yeah I can imagine
[19:25:09] <mingdao> If you text 911 in their area (Wayne County, NY) and it gets routed to Henderson, KY, the PSAP in KY isn't going to be able to dispatch services to you.
[19:25:47] <mingdao> We have had a lot of PEBKAC issues with this customer, and I have logged about 10 times the 'engineer hours' they paid for to date.  And the fun hasn't ended yet.  :/
[19:26:19] <mingdao> It's my fault for not testing a new SMS call before I pushed the update to add back those SIP Peers.
[19:26:19] <VectorX> though changing hardware has to be a new level of accommodation
[19:26:26] <mingdao> They pay for it.
[19:27:22] <mingdao> When they became a customer (2016), they bought hardware and software support for 5 years.  This year they purchased new hardware to replace old hardware.
[19:27:46] <VectorX> sweet
[19:28:02] <mingdao> This was the largest 'Hardware Refresh' to date.  And for some reason I get almost all of the 'firsts'.
[19:28:13] <VectorX> you must be the main man
[19:28:41] <mingdao> There were others with this customer ... first multi host 4.2.8.x to 4.4.2.x upgrade.  Lots of bugs and regressions in our 4.4.2 version software, also.
[19:29:05] <mingdao> I don't know about the main man.  Just the most diligent. ;)
[19:29:20] <VectorX> anyway, if you think you are not getting the expected results etc we can definitely help with the regex, if you have sample log entried to test that is providing incorrect results those would help, you can pastebin with an expire timer or add to regex101 and delete your paste once solved 
[19:29:25] <mingdao> Though I am not the best at anything, I only stop at perfection. 
[19:29:38] <VectorX> is there are reason you are using grep -E instead of grep -P ?
[19:29:46] <mingdao> Thanks, VectorX.  I really appreciate that.
[19:30:05] <mingdao> We have ALI parse that has PERL, Java, and some of our own company regex.
[19:30:10] <mingdao> It's a mess.
[19:30:48] <mingdao> If I can get output to "expected ... but found" I have no problem.  But sometimes getting to that point is a pita.
[19:31:17] <mingdao> VectorX: I am weak with the tools is the reason.
[19:31:20] <mingdao> Lack of use.

[19:31:53] <mingdao> I have some issues from injuries and if I don't use it, I lose it.  Lots of times I can think of something but can't make the correct word come out.
[19:31:53] <VectorX> yeah so if -P is available ie, grep --help, then you want to be using that
[19:32:00] <mingdao> It's getting worse, so I ask a lot.
[19:32:38] <mingdao> And we have different software on different servers.  Some old OpenSUSE, newer CentOS; I use primarily Arch on my own machines.
[19:32:42] *** Joins: luva (~luva@45.141.152.36)
[19:32:50] <VectorX> thats not a problem, but if you can provide sample data and point out what you are trying to do instead of a solution you are trying to implement we may be able to give better direction
[19:32:59] <mingdao> Various versions of everything; company software tends to be old.
[19:33:15] <VectorX> yeah in that case grep -E would be most favorable for compatibility
[19:33:52] <mingdao> I don't want to publicly post a file, but can msg you an example and post to a one-time link?  If you would like.
[19:35:17] <VectorX> thats fine, you can message who was helping you, and the guy who was is one of the foremost regex experts in the known universe, and I am not even joking
[19:35:28] <VectorX> hence why I asked about the typo ;)
[19:35:35] <VectorX> just doesnt compute
[19:37:31] <VectorX> though I would ask about PM beforehand
[19:42:35] <mingdao> VectorX: digitok has helped me as far back as I have ~/irclog/* ... to 2011, though 2003-2011 had to stay in China when we left, or I'd probably have some from there. ;)
[19:42:49] <VectorX> well there you go
[19:42:58] <VectorX> so you know I am not kidding
