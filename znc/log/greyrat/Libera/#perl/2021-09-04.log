[01:36:19] <EvanCarroll> what was the reason you found interesting enough to start this pursuit?
[01:36:31] <mst> EvanCarroll: SLIME
[01:37:42] <mst> I wanted to play around with SBCL and doing that without a repl-integrated editing environment was going to be missing the point
[01:39:24] <mst> later I plan to (a) learn org-mode (b) learn enough elisp to add my own customisations (possibly not in that order)
[01:39:39] <EvanCarroll> org-mode certainly had a lot of steam at one point in time.
[01:39:55] <EvanCarroll> I remember when like 80% of my LUG was using it.
[01:40:58] <EvanCarroll> I can understand org-mode and the attraction to it. I use zim (which is python and shitty) and I know a lot of people use other memex tools now.
[01:41:17] <EvanCarroll> I don't know what SLIME is or exactly why you'd want to learn an editor to use a high-performance LISP variant
[01:41:35] <EvanCarroll> but whatever, seems like near 100% of LISP users use emacs.
[01:41:46] <mst> but also I'd quite like to have an editor I can script sometimes
[01:41:48] *** Joins: scp1 (~magnus.wo@195-198-186-122.customer.telia.com)
[01:42:08] <EvanCarroll> not exactly sure how you can't script vim, it's a superior scriptable editor to emacs anyway.
[01:42:11] <mst> and, ok, elisp sucks in various ways
[01:42:25] <mst> but I'm entirely convinced that vimscript was a false flag operation to make elisp look good
[01:42:29] <EvanCarroll> It supports multithreading.
[01:42:49] <EvanCarroll> I don't think you have to use vimscript anymore, ever.
[01:43:12] <LeoNerd> vimscript was a sufficiently terrible experiment that neovim are busily ripping it out and just shoving a lua interpreter in instead
[01:43:24] <EvanCarroll> I mean, languageclient-neovim (which deceptively works on vim) is written in Rust not vimscript. and runs as a plugin on vim.
[01:43:29] <mst> which is fair enough, but I'd still rather use elisp
[01:44:01] <mst> I have the utmost respect for the work the neovim people are doing
[01:44:06] <EvanCarroll> We have one guy at our lux who uses a emacs xwindows server, which is hilarious because it's single threaded.
[01:44:16] <mst> you are not going to convince me to go neovim
[01:44:26] <mst> SLIME has actually convinced me to start learning meacs
[01:44:43] <EvanCarroll> all the neovim stuff is in modern vim now except the native language server (afaik)

[12:33:02] <last1> I am working with Email::MIME to add a signature to an e-mail, for 99% of cases it works great
[12:33:24] <last1> but I found a few extreme cases where I get errors like these: "\x{d83c}" does not map to UTF-8 at /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/Email/MIME.pm line 705, <STDIN> line 2538
[12:33:53] <last1> I thought utf-8 could represent all characters found in e-mail

[20:48:41] <mason> LeoNerd: I'm not sure how to arrange it, but finding something that already does it, seems like you'd be able to see what's there.
[20:49:07] <mason> LeoNerd: Also, there's https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/84951/copy-markdown-input-to-the-clipboard-as-rich-text#84952 which suggests that pandoc source might have some clues.

[20:49:41] <LeoNerd> Right; yeah..  `-t text/html`. I was afraid of that one :/

[20:51:34] <LeoNerd> Oh hah.. I really don't want to get *vim* to do it
[20:51:44] <LeoNerd> I've basically given up trying to work out how to make vim highlight my perl code correctly

[20:52:11] <LeoNerd> As far as I can tell it's easier to actually implement new syntax in perl, than it is to convince vim to highlight it
[20:53:20] <shlomif> LeoNerd: heh

[23:42:38] <LeoNerd> Hrm.. I have a sortof HTML-ish question, to do with some HTML I've copied out of a google docs slide via the clipboard. It doesn't have any linebreaks in it. I'm wondering if part of the style tags somehow explains that...

[23:45:10] <huf> oh wow
[23:45:12] <LeoNerd> Ohwait I see.. there are  <br />  tags in the actual HTML code which come out as nothing in the String::Tagged::HTML because it's an empty tag. Hah

[23:45:39] <huf> using deep magic on one who was there when it was written! *squee*
[23:46:03] <LeoNerd> I only noticed them when I pasted the HTML content itself into the paste site preparing my question
[23:46:43] <huf> oh, so String::Tagged::HTML only works on an idealized version of html?
[23:46:57] <LeoNerd> Very idealized. It can't handle emptywidth elements at all currently
