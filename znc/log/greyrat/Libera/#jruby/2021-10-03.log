[22:20:00] <JasonvanZyl[m]> Hi, is RoR generally expected to work with JRuby?
[22:20:21] <JasonvanZyl[m]> I haven't used RoR is a very, very long time and I was going to try the new hotwire goodies but wanted to use JRuby if I can
[22:29:06] <headius> Yes it is! There are some install issues with 6+ on Windows but it does run fine
