[01:45:40] <EvilDMP> SnoopJ: I'd *love* to use it, but I don't see the point. Maybe I am just missing something. There must be a reason other people find it valuable.
[01:45:44] <SnoopJ> somestring * int has a relatively obvious thing it can do (especially in light of what + does for strings), but / creates ambiguities
[01:46:14] <SnoopJ> EvilDMP, as I said, the point is to attach annotations to names. This is useful with tools that aren't mypy (attrs/pydantic come to mind, but there are others)

[01:46:43] <SnoopJ> as an aside, mypy *can* work with information just in comments, but the runtime doesn't store these like it does with annotations

[01:47:44] <SnoopJ> to the point about harming readability: I find that annotations can *improve* the readability of a function because I don't have to go track down every point of use to figure out what the type of a variable might be
[01:47:51] <jinsun> and types are useful for IDE completions, mypy is slow but pyright is fast enough to check as you type

[01:48:59] <glazed> are django questions okay here? my question might be ill-formed so apologies, but i'm trying to implement infinite scrolling. i have some javascript ajax code running that triggers correctly, but i don't actually know how to load more content into the html. i can't tell if i'm googling the wrong stuff, but i cannot for the life of me figure out
[01:48:59] <glazed> what to do. can i load the extra stuff purely in django, or do i need to basically duplicate the template into the javascript code for pushing new nodes into the dom?

[04:02:59] <Jong> Is there a simple way to recursively iterate through everything of an object. By that I mean suppose an object contains member objects, lists, and dictionaries and each of those contain within them objects, lists, and dictionaries. How'd you iterate through that? The examples I see on line are for just one type, like nested dicts, or nested lists. But nothing that's for every possible thing under an object

[04:14:19] <impermanence> I have a little psycopg2 script that simply inserts a time into a db as a dummy test for some database maintenance work I'm doing.  If the database goes down I want the script to simply print that the database is down.  I tried breaking the psycopg2 connection intentionally but then the script immediately exits with 'psycopg2.OperationalError'.
[04:14:19] <impermanence> How can I get the script to hang in there if psycopg2 is unable to connect and instead simply print "database down"?
[04:14:20] <Jong> oh I see

[07:53:15] <ztrawhcse> maybe I should just shove testsuite code into the main application so that I can use the version of the filter that "allows sanity"
[07:53:18] <jinsun> ztrawhcse: yeah I was in a similar situation few weeks back, I feel your pain
[07:53:21] <FunkyBob> do you?  then why is your code talking about pyodbc ?
[07:53:22] <SnoopJ> ztrawhcse, is that meant to imply that pytest only knows the "unittest each function input" style? It's quite good at dynamic testing in my experience.
[07:53:43] <SnoopJ> I mean, nobody wants to rewrite a test suite, so it's probably a done deal as far as the thing you're asking about, but...
[07:53:56] <FunkyBob> jamea: and why does it mention connecting to SQL Server?
[07:54:03] <ztrawhcse> SnoopJ: the problem is it's not good at doing 'subprocess.run([prog, args, ...])'

[13:17:22] <KirkMcDonald> parv: One approach is to define a type that holds and object and inverts the comparison operators for that object.
[13:17:28] <KirkMcDonald> holds an object*
[13:17:53] <KirkMcDonald> parv: Then have your key function return these objects when a field is to be inverted.
[13:18:10] <tm007> parv: Wondering what's your use case

[14:03:18] <diverdude> If i use with concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=alloc_cores) as executor and do executor.map(func,iterable) where alloc_cores is e.g. 10 and my iterable has 30 entries, that means that 20 "jobs" needs to be queued up somehow. How is this queue working? And is this queue consuming memory?

[16:38:41] <ham5urg> When I invoke wx.FileSelector (wxPython), how to preset the filename? I added default_path=a_complex_filename but when I click on the save-button (in Gnome) the fileselector opens with an empty filename-inputfield.
[16:39:11] <xheimlich> so obj.my_attr can be expressed as getattr(obj, "my_attr"), right.
[16:39:31] <xheimlich> is there some similar syntax for methods? or should I just say getattr(obj, "mymethod")()

[16:43:22] <supakeen> Julia is faster in computation, its ecosystem is smaller.

[16:44:56] <supakeen> It seems to hold a nice niche in some scientific areas but numpy/scipy/matplotlib/pandas are also pretty default in that world so I dunno.
[16:44:56] <Masklin_Gurder> So they don't really compete for the same niche.

[19:03:22] <CrtxReavr> Well. . . via paramiko, yes.

[20:18:55] <SnoopJ> Guest50, those functions all have the same name. Type annotations can be helpful to declare intent about functions (or if you use tools that consume them, like mypy), but they aren't mandatory.
[20:19:52] <Guest50> it's seen as good practise tho or is it not important if the function is obvious
[20:20:23] <yitz> Type annotations are good practice. Using a type check tool is good, too.

[20:20:50] <Guest50> okay
[20:20:53] <yitz> Being obvious doesn't stop people from calling it with the wrong types. Annotations and checks do.

[20:21:57] <SnoopJ> jmd, Python is strongly typed for any definition of "strong" that I've seen. Do you mean statically typed?

[20:22:38] <jmd> SnoopJ: Yeah.  That's what I meant.
[20:23:14] <SnoopJ> right, annotations combined with static analysis tools provide a lot of the program-verification benefits such languages have
[20:23:33] <SnoopJ> (with far fewer of the compile-type optimizations unless you're doing really niche stuff)

[23:17:31] <bjs> mike18_: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/stop/  suggests the main process inside the container will receive SIGTERM , so it looks like it does send something to the container in a nice way.
[23:17:33] <SnoopJ> if you want something to be printed, you should be using print() in general.
[23:17:49] <bjs> Pi-sistance: I mean that's very normal. If you actually write .py files then nothing is printed by default at all.
