[01:43:21] <matsaman> I would put 'a' within and not around a 'cite', which is for marking up titles of things
[01:44:53] <matsaman> I think on this page basically everything in the white area (except 'Comments about...') would be the 'article'
[01:45:43] <lechner> the list on the bottom gets super long sometimes (>10k)
[01:45:55] <matsaman> 'menu' is basically for a 'toolbar'

[01:46:17] <matsaman> lechner: is the list related to the copy?
[01:47:00] <matsaman> it's just a list of packages for which 'ambiguous-paragraph-in-dep5-copyright' was triggered?

[01:47:54] <matsaman> particularly with newer elements like 'article'
[01:48:26] <matsaman> what's useful when you're fresh with HTML is to look at the page with no CSS applied
[01:48:49] <matsaman> if you've used proper HTML, it will be somewhat spartan, but still look like a proper document, because of the browser's default CSS
[01:49:41] <matsaman> headers (h1-h6), p-aragraphs, lists, they're going to be most of the markup anyone uses (creators & consumers both)

[02:59:40] <matsaman> I'm not sure what actually usefully consumes them better than they would a plain 'div'
[03:00:04] <matsaman> but _theoretically_ something could consume your page/s and do something interesting with each 'article' contents
[03:00:14] <matsaman> "here are all the articles on lechner's site: ...."
[03:00:17] <matsaman> and so on
[03:00:32] <lechner> it also makes it easier for you and i to discuss my issues...
[03:00:47] <matsaman> but you could do the same thing with just h1-h6
[03:01:02] <matsaman> "here are all the h# level sections on lechner's site: ..."
[03:01:18] <matsaman> it's pretty easy to use 'article' and 'section', though, so no biggie

[06:16:06] <FunkyBob> basically, how do these content blocks relate to each other?
[06:16:30] <lechner> the site is currently all server generated, so the url is WYSIWYG
[06:16:42] <FunkyBob> ... total nonsequiter there
[06:17:03] <lechner> which HR?
[06:17:26] <lechner> the tag version only goes to the HR
[06:17:47] <lechner> the generated data below stays the same
[06:17:49] <FunkyBob> oh, you've implemented it as a border-dop on the section which starts "The following 25 source package"
[06:18:59] <lechner> border-dop?
[06:19:17] <FunkyBob> top
[06:19:21] <FunkyBob> typo
[06:19:24] <lechner> i can change anything, but brb in twenty minutes
[06:19:44] <FunkyBob> sure, but to know what to change, we need to know what all this means
[06:19:49] <FunkyBob> and how it all  relates
[06:19:56] <FunkyBob> the _structure_ of this content

[07:02:55] <lechner> well, for the tags there is a description (everything above the HR) that is is (or ca be) different for each version. The actual hits from the archive a below that, for any version

[07:13:55] <FunkyBob> so looking at https://lintian.debian.org/tags/binary-file-built-without-LFS-support
[07:14:09] <FunkyBob> the H1, does not change with version?
[07:14:19] <FunkyBob> the blue box does, as does the description beneath it?
[07:14:32] <FunkyBob> but after hte line... the list if packages... they do not
[07:14:38] <FunkyBob> s/if/of/
[07:17:06] <FunkyBob> lechner: when I select a new version, how much of the content changes?
[07:19:03] <FunkyBob> oh... just spotted that your top navbar uses float, too... :/
[07:21:19] *** Joins: georgios (~georgios@user/georgios)
[07:25:52] <lechner> for a tag, the visibility symbol change but the name stays the same
[07:25:59] <lechner> in H1
[07:26:35] <lechner> after HR, it's the same for all versions. i think it even says so
[07:27:02] <FunkyBob> and... the rest of it?
[07:28:30] <lechner> the data in between can change. it corresponds to files like this (which need better formatting, too.)    https://salsa.debian.org/lintian/lintian/-/blob/master/tags/b/binary-file-built-without-LFS-support.tag
[07:29:01] <lechner> that's a particularly disorderly exemple
[07:29:29] <lechner> i picked it only because the p is so long
[07:30:16] <FunkyBob> so it would make sense to group the version list and the related content... because they are... related
[07:30:45] <lechner> yes
[07:31:11] <lechner> i think i see where you are going with this
[07:31:11] <FunkyBob> so... wrap them in a container, set that container to flex, and that ensures they sit beside each other
[07:31:39] <lechner> let me try that
[07:32:17] <lechner> which container?
[07:32:17] <FunkyBob> if you set flex: 0 auto;   on the version list, and flex: 1;  on the other container... they should fill the space nicely

[07:36:02] *** Quits: Rockwood (~Rocky@user/rocky) (Quit: The Time is Over)
[07:36:38] <FunkyBob> see the guide I linked before

[07:38:01] <FunkyBob> there should be a container that encloses both the versions list and the article
[07:38:11] <FunkyBob> to that you will set display: flex;
[07:41:33] <FunkyBob> what are the options on this 'visibility-symbol'?
[07:44:31] <lechner> sorry i'm taking so long. my templating uses a lot in indents
[07:44:52] <FunkyBob> that's why I let my tools keep things tidy
[07:44:52] <lechner> by options you mean classes?
[07:45:53] <lechner> i do not have good tools for pug, but i am moving away from it next week
[07:48:47] <FunkyBob> I mean how many different symbols are there?  I and what else?
[07:48:48] *** Joins: z8z (~x@ac255238.ppp.asahi-net.or.jp)
[07:48:52] <FunkyBob> states, even
[07:49:59] <lechner> https://lintian.debian.org/levels
[07:50:11] <lechner> eight of them
[07:50:49] <lechner> actually, the tags cannot be M or O, but you may not care
[07:54:58] <FunkyBob> hmm... but I guess it's useful for them to link to that document...
[07:55:31] <lechner> the boxes look great, except the version are on the left and not the right (despite float: right) and the version box extends all the way to the bottom of the container
[07:56:28] <lechner> i implemented it just recently    https://salsa.debian.org/lintian/detagtive/-/issues/15
[07:56:52] <FunkyBob> wait.
[07:56:55] <FunkyBob> where are you using float?
[07:57:36] <lechner> it's still in there from before.
[07:57:44] <lechner>  does the order of the elements matter?
[07:57:50] <FunkyBob> not greatly
[07:57:55] <FunkyBob> you should not have float anywhere in that page
[08:02:33] <lechner> it's gone, except in the menu above
[08:03:04] <FunkyBob> yeah, I've been working on  that :P
[08:03:05] <FunkyBob> https://jsfiddle.net/bkhq902p/
[08:05:55] <lechner> that looks beautiful when you do it!
[08:08:01] <FunkyBob> can there ever be more than one 'hints-by-source'?
[08:08:37] <FunkyBob> in a single page, that is
[08:09:06] <lechner> no
[08:09:21] <FunkyBob> then you might consider making it an ID not a class
[08:09:26] <FunkyBob> also means it navigable
[08:09:35] <lechner> we can actually just call it hints
[08:09:45] <lechner> sure
[08:10:43] <FunkyBob> https://jsfiddle.net/bkhq902p/1/
[08:10:55] <FunkyBob> anyway... as you may see, the navbar is done without floats
[08:11:11] <FunkyBob> and I try to keep markup to a minimum, but use it for what it means
[08:11:13] <lechner> maybe i'll do the with the explanation, too. that's what most people look at
[08:11:23] <FunkyBob> e.g.  using <h1> in the header, where you had <p>
[08:13:11] <lechner> not to divert blame, but i think i inherited that somewhere. lintian is 24 years old
[08:13:35] <FunkyBob> no doubt
[08:14:09] <lechner> but i just spent four years modernizing it. the website is the missing piece
[08:14:42] <lechner> and all the visuals
[08:15:04] <FunkyBob> https://jsfiddle.net/bkhq902p/1/
[08:15:40] <FunkyBob> this habit if putting the same class at every levle is... peculiar
[08:15:52] <FunkyBob> oh, no, wait, I'm just misreading it
[08:17:34] <lechner> i have a lot to learn
[08:18:21] <FunkyBob> https://jsfiddle.net/bkhq902p/2/
[08:18:39] <FunkyBob> there's some basics... and once you've started with them, a lot falls into place
[08:19:15] <FunkyBob> but as per our discussion above... I think you're starting to see how "describing the structure of your content" can really make a difference
[08:19:29] <FunkyBob> you already had lists, and some sections (even if t hey were all divs)
[08:19:44] <FunkyBob> but there was more structure you hadn't expressed... like the relation between verions and that other content
[08:20:11] <lechner> can just copy the css from you, insert the section.version (your containing element) andintegrate from there?
[08:20:23] <FunkyBob> mostly, yeah
[08:20:35] <FunkyBob> I've also reworked your visibility indicators
[08:21:23] <FunkyBob> it's better if you graft piece by piece, and understand the related css as you go
[08:21:32] *** Quits: pavonia (~user@user/siracusa) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[08:22:05] <lechner> you used words like "error" instead of "E" right? i like that
[08:22:22] <FunkyBob> that's from intent labeling
[08:22:29] <FunkyBob> the intent is to express it's an error
[08:22:37] <FunkyBob> _how_ that's expressed is stylistic
[08:23:40] <lechner> that's also inherited. i actually construct the letters server side from "error", "warning" etc
[08:24:29] <lechner> i am also totally explicit in my code. my code is read a lot fore often than rewritten
[08:24:47] <FunkyBob> how very Pythonic :)
[08:25:02] <lechner> they came up with that?
[08:25:23] <FunkyBob> it's one of Guido's starting principles
[08:25:43] <FunkyBob> it may have been around longer, but it's something Python emphasises
[08:26:42] <lechner> i'm glad to hear it! that's the only piece of python i'm not at loggerheads with then. i have tried so hard, but do not get it
[08:28:09] <lechner> i can make the links to levels (ids on that page into words too
[08:28:54] <FunkyBob> pardon?

[18:03:52] <undefined_bob> any idea why unicode seems to render different in the browsers console (F12) versus pasting the unicode in the HTML file on the server?
[18:04:43] <undefined_bob> I treid to add a country flag to some code. And when I copy the flag symbol from a website and paste it into my code in the Browser (F12) I can see the flag
[18:05:07] <undefined_bob> but when I paste the same content into my HTML file and upload it, its broken at best
[18:06:43] <pavonia> Either the server is reading the file in the wrong format or it's serving it wrong or the HTML code has the wrong encoding
[18:09:53] <undefined_bob> maybe it also could be an editor thing?
[18:10:14] <undefined_bob> because my editor does not display the flag icon like the browser do
[18:10:49] <undefined_bob> but I'll just try to use an svg instead. maybe its the more elegant solution anyway
[18:12:14] <pavonia> Yeah, the editor could also save the file in the wrong format
[18:12:32] *** Quits: vysn (~vysn@user/vysn) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[18:12:33] <nbjoerg> wrong font?
[18:13:16] <pavonia> The editor's font doesn't really matter here if the result is wrong in the HTML output
[18:14:14] <undefined_bob> but the editor only shows me those empty squares and not the flag symbol. and when I upload that file then I see all kind of weird characters
[18:14:38] <undefined_bob> I just tried to copy the small flag symbol from https://www.alt-codes.net/flags
[18:15:28] <undefined_bob> if I use the HTML Dec Code I dont get the flag symbol either but two circles with one letter in them
[18:16:03] <undefined_bob> the the US for example one light blue circle with an U and one with a S. Instead of the flag symbol
[18:17:12] <pavonia> In your browser?
[18:18:20] <undefined_bob> yes
[18:18:53] <nbjoerg> well, unicode doesn't specify how a specific codepoint is supposed to render
[18:19:01] <undefined_bob> in the editor I saw the correct decimal code &#127465 &#127466
[18:19:12] <nbjoerg> so a different font is perfectly entiled to show them different...
[18:19:19] <undefined_bob> ohh
[18:19:36] <undefined_bob> I thought its universal and all the same everywhere
[18:19:46] <nbjoerg> I'm also a bit puzzled why they are two code point values
[18:20:05] <nbjoerg> oh, combining operator?
[18:20:08] <pavonia> That's how Unicode defines them
[18:20:42] <undefined_bob> I dont know. All I needed was a simple small US and German flag. I and thought I could to it quick and dirty with unicode
[18:20:43] *** phryk_ is now known as phryk
[18:20:45] <undefined_bob> me wrong
[18:20:54] <pavonia> It's basically letters which in the right combination show up as a flag
[18:21:26] <undefined_bob> right combination and right conditions, I would guess
[18:22:02] <nbjoerg> well, more like the German umlaut ö can be expressed as "LATIN LOWER CASE O" combined with a diacrit
[18:22:53] <undefined_bob> ö is &ouml;
[18:23:57] <nbjoerg> ...missing the point
[18:24:27] *** Quits: FlorianBad (~FlorianBa@cpe-67-49-107-16.dc.res.rr.com) (Quit: Client closed)
[18:25:16] <pavonia> It's still weird that the browser doesn't fall back to the system's rendering if the symbol isn't in the current font
[18:25:17] <nbjoerg> &#xF6; and &#x6F;&#308; are equivalent
[18:27:30] <stenno> why are they getting converted to entities in teh first place?
[18:28:49] <stenno> browsers can display unicode just fine nowadays, you only need to escape ?,<,>
[18:29:08] <undefined_bob> maybe my browser is too old?
[18:29:27] <stenno> unlikely
[18:29:28] <pavonia> As I understand they are not converted but pasted literally
[18:32:26] <undefined_bob> if I copy paste the &#127465 &#127466 in my HTML file I see the circles with the single letter U and S in them. If I copy the flag symbol from the website and paste that flag into the browser with F12 console I see the correct flag symbol. but when I paste that said flag symbol in my editor (notepad++) and then upload the HTML file again I see garbage characters instead of a flag
[18:32:26] <nbjoerg> also make sure to use combining entities without any space in between...
[18:34:36] <pavonia> undefined_bob: What character encoding is selected for the file in Notepad++?
[18:34:50] <stenno> inb4 BOM
[18:35:28] <undefined_bob> pavonia: ANSI
[18:35:45] <pavonia> Well that's wrong
[18:36:07] <pavonia> Select UTF-8 without BOM
[18:36:20] <pavonia> Then repaste the characters
[18:36:41] <stenno> BOMs were a mistake
[18:37:08] <undefined_bob> pavonia: sadly the whole website got the encoding ISO-8859-1
[18:37:25] <undefined_bob> nbjoerg: maybe that was the solution
[18:38:29] <pavonia> Okay, then you need to use the HTML entities
[18:41:36] <stenno> >.<
[18:47:09] <undefined_bob> okay, my mistake was that I didn't really understood how those combining entities work and that I didn't know the space between them was wrong
[18:47:36] <undefined_bob> without the space I see the flag symbol instead of the two circles with the single letters
