[20:14:16] <rwb> stronk typing django is hard and requires a mypy plugin
[20:14:37] <rwb> and it seems so far that no language server is willing to use mypy as a typechecking backend
[20:15:48] <rwb> i don't know why, but python-lsp-server (fork of palantir's pyls after it was discontinued) just doesn't work at all for me, and ms-python-language-server and pyright both report too many false positives wrt typing to be useful
[20:16:17] <rwb> django does a lot of MagickTM with __new__ for models, and python's typing system currently can't keep up with it

[20:18:05] <rwb> if i didn't have a bunch on my plate already i'd be implementing my own python language server just to see how far i can get. i've seriously considered it multiple times
[20:18:26] <rwb> stuff like typescript has tooling that's miles ahead in this area
[20:18:35] <epilys> rwb, I use mypy already but obviously not comparable to strong types
[20:18:37] <southclaws> i've always felt that when working with python
[20:19:05] <rwb> epilys: of course. it would be akin to typescript where you have the tooling check the types
[20:19:35] <rwb> but when editor support (read: LSP nowadays) is good enough, it feels very close to strongly types
[20:19:38] <rwb> typed*
[20:19:56] <rwb> just have mypy checking as a pre-commit hook to make sure you don't push code that doesn't typecheck
[20:20:13] <rwb> but the tooling just isn't on the same level :^(
[20:21:07] <southclaws> I tried Poetry recently, that seemed okay, bit weird but it's a decent step
[20:21:27] <southclaws> before that, I used pipenv which is apparently dead now and prior to that was just a nightmare of pain
