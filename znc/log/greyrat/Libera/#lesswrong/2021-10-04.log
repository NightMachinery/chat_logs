[00:07:06] <gwern> mao was so evil partly because he was so jealous
[00:07:37] <shawwwn> Oolong can do a greater leap forward than you
[00:07:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> "post-communist countries are generally more patriarchal than comparable peers"
[00:07:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Over forty percent of Russia‚Äôs published economists and business leaders are women."
[00:08:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> Sorry, is he saying that this number is higher ... where? In the U.S.?
[00:08:18] <saturn2> if you're so smart, why aintcha sovereign
[00:08:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> There's no way the U.S. scores more highly on this sort of metric than Russia
[00:08:26] <shawwwn> Exactly
[00:08:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Nearly half the world‚Äôs self-made female billionaires are Chinese. In East Asia, women who grew up under communism are especially competitive (as suggested by natural and lab experiments). Vietnam, Georgia, China, and Mongolia have the smallest gender gaps even in competitive chess, which in the rest of the world is a male preserve. " ... likewise
[00:09:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> What is there left of "patriarchy" after you end up doing better on tangible measures like this than Western democracies??
[00:09:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> Random men you ask opinions of in surveys tell you that women belong in the kitchen?
[00:09:39] <saturn2> there are labs where they experimentally raise women under communism? jeez
[00:10:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like, how is that survey stuff more relevant than the actual facts of gender distribution in industry and science etc.?
[00:10:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't get this perspective at all
[00:10:32] <saturn2> dr. fauci has a LOT to answer for
[00:11:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> Isn't the takeaway here "in Russia, if you're a woman men will say sexist stuff to you but you still have an almost equal chance of ending up with money/power/success as a man, while in the United States it's the exact opposite"?
[00:11:54] <gwern> shawwwn: hm. I am not sure about that. humans can leap a shocking distance forward
[00:12:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> (And that's IF you take the surveys/interviews at face value, in the first place...)
[00:15:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like... before we emigrated, my mother worked as a teacher. She earned as much as her male colleagues. The head of her department was a woman. The principal of the school (and it was a fairly prestigious school, the kind that the government permitted enough freedom that they could decide to run experimental educational programs, etc.) was a woman. I have never heard of any hint that my mother or any woman she knew was ever
[00:15:09] <Obormot\Arcturus>  discriminated against on the basis of gender. For being Jewish? Totally. For being a woman? Nope...
[00:18:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> It kinda sounds like the author of this post has some preconceived notions about how the only alternatives are "patriarchy" and "feminism", and the only way to fight "patriarchy" is "feminism", and therefore if a political system suppresses or fails to foster "feminism", it therefore definitionally advances the cause of "patriarchy"
[00:19:01] <saturn2> the problem was probably a lack of sinecure positions for official feminists
[00:20:02] <saturn2> how many diversity, equity, and inclusion officers were there in the ussr? checkmate, commies
[00:22:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Cuba doesn‚Äôt even have gender-based violence legislation!" ... checkmate indeed
[00:23:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> "A ‚Äòreal Russian muzhik‚Äô (man) is tough, strong and patriotic. Living in the shadow of organised crime, working class men have learnt to project brutal dominance.

[01:49:40] <RiversHaveWings> shawwwn: ...They are surely not Python lists of lists of floats?
[01:49:54] <shawwwn> they are in fact python lists of lists of data structures that represent floats, yes
[01:49:54] <RiversHaveWings> The Python float type is 64-bit anyway.

[04:13:59] <ggreer> I'm suspicious. all the research is done by one guy. also what's the proposed mechanism of action?
[04:16:57] <gwern> 'Dr. Atkinson owns all shares of Obetech, LLC, a company that markets assays to detect infection with human adenovirus-36 and owns patent rights for these assays.' hm

[04:19:38] <gwern> looks like Dhurandhar and Atkinson have done almost all of the research
[04:20:20] <ggreer> yeah
[04:20:32] <gwern> 'A study of 89 twin pairs from New York City was conducted.61 Because twins tend to be similar in many characteristics, including body weight, twin pairs discordant for Ad-36 antibodies were studied. Antibody-positive twins were slightly, but significantly, heavier and fatter than their antibody-negative cotwins; the BMI was 24.5+5.2 vs 23.1+4.5 kg/m2 (P<.03) and percent body fat was...
[04:20:38] <gwern> ...29.6+9.5% vs 27.5+9.9% (P<.04), respectively, in the antibody-positive vs antibody-negative twins. The twin pairs were significantly younger than the individuals in the aforementioned general population study. There were no differences in BMI or percent body fat in cotwins discordant for antibodies to Ad-2, Ad-31, or Ad-37.61 In contrast to the other experiments mentioned previously, no...
[04:20:42] <ggreer> maybe they're onto something. maybe they're bullshitting
[04:20:44] <gwern> ...differences were noted in serum lipids in the discordant twin pairs.' haha what
[04:21:16] <gwern> p=0.03 and p=0.04, so p-hacking, and the difference they're claiming vindicates all of the estimates like '+50 pounds' is in twins... 1.4kg?
[04:21:24] <ggreer> wtf? yeah that's absurd
[04:21:58] <gwern> 'The data from twins in which one member of the twin pair is infected and the other is not infected provide perhaps the best evidence that Ad-36 causes obesity in humans. The infected twins were heavier and fatter than the uninfected cotwins.' https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(11)61392-X/fulltext ah yes, I agree that p-hacking +1.4kg sure vindicates it all

[04:49:44] <ggreer> so I'd miss my connecting flight to portland
[04:49:57] <ggreer> now the flight has landed but it has a mechanical issue and likely won't fly tonight

[04:51:36] <ggreer> catern: best case right now I spend the night in chicago. worst case I spend the night in dayton
[04:53:44] <gwern> damn, what a pair of choices
[04:53:56] <ggreer> yeah
[04:54:21] <catern> the chicago airport has a nice botanical garden if I recall correctly, which I once slept in
[04:54:37] <catern> that would be my choice
[04:55:10] <ggreer> https://i.imgur.com/iMjSekr.jpg
[04:55:21] <ggreer> also it has that box, which if you can get into is probably a good time
[04:55:37] <ggreer> that's inside security, btw
[04:55:53] <ggreer> like... you take your weed past the TSA then... get rid of it before chicago cops bust you for it?
[05:03:37] <saturn2> they probably figure people need their weed to get through the stress of the TSA search
[05:18:36] <gwern> ggreer: what about people flying in?
[05:19:22] <ggreer> you have to go through TSA screening to fly in
[05:19:39] <ggreer> all the airports are part of a one big sterile system
[05:46:58] <catern> presumably the box was originally intended to be outside security but some insane bureaucratic process led to it being put inside, where it's useless (due to lack of space outside or whatever)

The highly anticipated adaptation, which is currently playing in over six thousand theaters in thirty-two markets, has yet to see a significant box office drop, and likely won‚Äôt before it hits American theaters, where it has been eagerly awaited by fans of Frank Herbert‚Äôs 1965 novel.

[10:29:44] <kuudes> "Mechanisms of airborne transmission: The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted controversies and unknowns about how respiratory pathogens spread between hosts. Traditionally, it was thought that respiratory pathogens spread between people through large droplets produced in coughs and through contact with contaminated surfaces (fomites). However, several respiratory pathogens are known to spread through small respiratory aerosols, which can float and travel 
[10:29:45] <kuudes> in air flows, infecting people who inhale them at short and long distances from the infected person. Wang et al. review recent advances in understanding airborne transmission gained from studying the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections and other respiratory pathogens. The authors suggest that airborne transmission may be the dominant form of transmission for several respiratory pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, 
[10:29:45] <kuudes> and that further understanding of the mechanisms underlying infection from the airborne route will better inform mitigation measures. ‚ÄîGKA"

[17:59:10] <feepbot> <gwern> 'The focus of our work, similar to the L0 literature, is on how to encourage the learning process to be frugal in terms of parameter usage. However instead of achieving this by adding an explicit penalty, we enhance the ‚Äúrich get richer‚Äù nature of gradient descent. In particular we propose a new parameterisation that ensures steps taken by gradient descent are
[17:59:11] <feepbot> proportional to the magnitude of the parameters. In other words, parameters with larger magnitudes are allowed to adapt faster in order to represent the required features to solve the task, while smaller magnitude parameters are restricted, making it more likely that they will be irrelevant in representing the learned solution.' https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.00296 sounds like the

[22:10:08] <SDr> now, being a catgirl in vrc _is_ (the closest we currently have to) wireheading, and one could argue it's making one one drifting away from reality; OTOH, I observe, like, literally 10s of thousands of college students also catgirl'ing in there, and note that this might be one of those things where the dissasociated reality will become the map and

[22:18:59] <rsaarelm> SDr: So are the tulpas a product of some weird focused mental practice that produces unusual effects or are they just a sort of habit of thought where you split off an imagined persona you view from the outside?
[22:22:08] <pompolic> a pervasive virtual world would be fun, actually
[22:22:09] <SDr> PapuaHardyNet, they're representing different perspectives / lenses into the same reality;   benefit is that they each have a memory castle of carried mental tools, which force-multiplies the number of perspectives by which I can look at stuff
[22:23:17] <SDr> PapuaHardyNet, and they can dialog with eachother, which I _could_ do by "myself", but because of their unique toolset, these dialogues can go to _really_ weird, and constructive places
[22:24:26] <PapuaHardyNet> That sounds incredibly useful
[22:25:34] <SDr> rsaarelm, you know that thing when you're thinking of a hard problem, and you ponder if you should ask a more-experienced friend x about it, and as you think through what x would say to it, the solution comes to your mind?  that's basically the mental routine. There are ways to amplify it (rubber duck debugging, writing stuff down, etc), and _that
[22:25:34] <SDr> piece_ is more difficult, but the basic steps are habitual

[22:33:44] <feepbot> them. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a new way of thinking about aging,‚Äù said Dr. Cheng-Ming Chuong, a skin cell researcher and professor of pathology at the University of Southern California, who was not involved in Dr. Yi‚Äôs study, which was published on Monday in the journal Nature Aging.

[22:33:44] <feepbot> the process by preventing stem cells from escaping...What they saw was a surprise: When the animals started to grow old and gray and lose their hair, their stem cells started to escape their little homes in the bulge.
