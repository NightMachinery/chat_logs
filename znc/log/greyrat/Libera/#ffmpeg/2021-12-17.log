[06:12:36] <foodini> It's an extra layer of complexity in a build system that would be incredibly hard to justify. Rather than just having the windows build agent, we'd have to add linux agents to build the ffmpeg product, package it, copy it to the _actual_ build machine, and do the build of the executable there. This thing is supposed to be compilable on Windows, so
[06:12:36] <foodini> I need to exhaust that process. The fact that I got it working a couple years ago makes it infuriating that it's standing in my way nrow.

[06:38:40] <foodini> Section 4.2 of https://ffmpeg.org/platform.html has you run the ming-w64.bat from within the visual studio command environment. This just adds the bin directory to the current path, but section 4.2 continues as though you'd be in a bash shell. (./configure instead of configure, etc.) There must be a recent change that's affected the process?

[13:34:47] <vanjavk> Hey guys, what would you recommend as solution to creating a RTMP stream out of .jpg image with LOW CPU usage.  Currently I'm using this: "ffmpeg -loop 1 -re -start_number 0 -i {name}.jpg -an -framerate 30 -shortest -movflags +faststart  -f flv -flvflags no_duration_filesize rtmp://" and it works fine for small images, like 300x300, but for larger
[13:34:47] <vanjavk> CPU usage noticeably increases. Image changes like every 2-3 seconds. framerate doesn't seem to impact CPU at all
[13:36:42] <another|> foodini: hmm.. those instructions seem to be indeed outdated. as is apparently the wiki https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/CompilationGuide/MinGW

[14:28:28] <vanjavk> Stream #0:0 -> #0:0 (mjpeg (native) -> flv1 (flv))
[14:28:41] <vanjavk> 263 video standard, under the name of Sorenson Spark (FourCC FLV1). Sorenson Spark is an older codec for FLV files but it is also a widely available...
[14:29:32] <roxlu> emcodem: I just have a raw opus bitstream (not muxed in ogg) and I want to know if ffmpeg can mux it. No probs if you don't know how to do this. I'm not sure if ffmpeg can do this tbh.
[14:34:09] <emcodem> vanjavk hm not too many options available for mjpeg. Maybe you can switch to hardware encoding h264?
[14:39:28] <vanjavk> so I'm assuming something adding something like:  -c:v h264 -preset ultrafast ?
[14:39:51] <vanjavk> using that about doubles cpu usage from 3-5% to 7-10%
[14:44:25] <emcodem> yeah but can you use nvenc or va_api?
[14:49:26] <vanjavk> machine won't have GPU so no, it will be a linux server. Never heard of va_api before tho, but from what I see it needs at least integrated gpus?
[14:49:37] <emcodem> exactly
[14:53:58] <emcodem> if it reeally produces flv1 by default, maybe it helps to disable motion est
[14:54:05] <emcodem> -motion_est 0

[14:57:58] <furq> don't use flv1 unless you expect people to watch this in flash player
[14:58:21] <furq> that default should really be changed
[14:58:38] <vanjavk> thanks for suggestion, but I can't see any difference in performance when adding -motion_est 0
[14:59:03] <vanjavk> actually that's exactly what i'm expecting
[15:00:24] <emcodem> oh really? why were you expecting that?
[15:00:53] <vanjavk> I mean I'm expecting people to watch it in flash player, was responding to other guy's comment, sorry emcodem
[15:01:02] <emcodem> heh
[15:03:06] <emcodem> well you can check if any other option influences but i'd really have expected that motion estimation should influence cpu usage
[15:03:07] <emcodem> ffmpeg -h encoder=flv1
[15:05:26] <emcodem> also i am curious about how you manage the flash player stuff, isnt it banned from all browsers already?
[15:07:35] <furq> well also don't use flv1 in general because it's ancient

[15:08:23] <emcodem> but what could be an alternative to save cpu power?
[15:08:49] <emcodem> mpeg1? :D
[15:09:12] <JEEB> fastdecode with H.264
[15:09:15] <JEEB> as in CAVLC etc
[15:09:39] <JEEB> I've played SD H.264 on a 733MHz Celeron based Pentium III
[15:09:47] <JEEB> (fastdecode specifically)
[15:10:01] <JEEB> (it's a x264 tune)
[15:10:47] <emcodem> uhhh tahts really good to know
[15:10:55] <DHE> would that work for hardware players?
[15:11:09] <JEEB> if they support H.264 generally, yes
[15:11:24] <JEEB> note: I mentioned this since flv1 was mentioned :P
[15:11:28] <JEEB> which most likely is not gonna be supported
[15:11:40] <DHE> specifically, given a level 4.1 decoder, could I, uhh, trick it into playing at 4.2 speeds with that..
[15:12:12] <JEEB> probably not, since the CAVLC and CABAC "decoders" would probably be set for a specific speed
[15:12:39] <JEEB> this is more towards software decoding side of things
[15:12:44] <JEEB> since CAVLC is just variable length coding
[15:12:52] <JEEB> while CABAC is arithmetic coding
[15:19:58] <vanjavk> emcodem, for testing I use basilisk browser with flash player installation I found on reddit :)
[15:29:57] <vanjavk> JEEB, I'm new to this stuff, but if you're mentioning decoding that assumes i'm decoding from another video? Because here I'm using images so that won't help at all if I understand correctly?
