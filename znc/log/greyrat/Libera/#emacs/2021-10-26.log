[04:11:21] <rdrg109> Imagine a site where we can ask questions like: "Which functions from Emacs 18 to Emacs 28 were mapped to C-x C-b" or "List of functions that call kill-buffer in Emacs 27 and Emacs 26" or "All functions that have C-x as a prefix".
[04:12:06] <rdrg109> It would be like a Wikidata but entirely focused on Emacs things (source code, packages, mantainers, commits, etc.)
[04:12:46] <twb> rdrg109: it's called git.sv.gnu.org
[04:13:47] <rdrg109> twb: Is information indexed in a such a way that can be easily queried?
[04:14:06] <rdrg109> In Wikidata, information is stored as key, values and that makes information queriable.
[04:14:07] <twb> rdrg109: yes, it uses a content-oriented filesystem called "git"
[04:15:51] <rdrg109> Mh, that's fair, we can use grep for solving some of our questions, but I was just thinking of having all information of Emacs stored a knowledge base just as Wikidata does it.
[04:16:14] <aidalgol> That sounds like a lot of work for very infrequent questions.
[04:17:52] <Guest-liao> Where did you grep in the webpage http://git.savannah.gnu.org/?
[04:17:59] <rdrg109> Mhh, that's true, but it would also help us to build graphs of how functions call each other.
[04:18:21] <aidalgol> And what utility would there be in that?
[04:18:24] <rdrg109> Guest-liao: Sorry, I meant "cloning the required git repositories hosted in that site and then use grep".
[04:18:31] <aidalgol> Getting karma on r/dataisbeatiful?
[04:20:16] <rdrg109> No. The same motivation that the people of Wikidata has (which I don't), but there must be something that keeps the development and contributions going.
[04:21:58] <rdrg109> To fully answer your question, I think I would need to understand what questions are solved with Wikidata and what do people use it for and probably those actions can also be applied in the context of Emacs and be helpful to the community

[05:12:48] <twb> did you read the source?
[05:13:25] <dcx> I know one is elisp and one is c, but the c one also returns a whole whack of hash tables instead of a list
[05:13:30] <twb> It looks- right
[05:14:41] <twb> dcx: it looks to me like the purpose of json-parse-string is to serialize arbitrary elisp objects to json

[05:52:01] <dale> json.el is a pure Elisp JSON library, I believe.  (I think if you ask the LSP people they'd probably say that it's a lot slower than the C JSON stuff, for their purposes, which is basically spewing JSON and parsing JSON all day long.)
[05:56:45] <Guest-liao> Yes, Sure, my big guess is that json.el is for that pp(pretty print), if we format a large json file, Emacs got sucked.

[06:01:59] <Guest-liao> Like emacs-26.3
[06:02:16] <dale> Guest-liao: I think you're asking which package you need to have available to get JSON support in Emacs, in which case it's https://github.com/akheron/jansson I *think*.  Your OS probably has it available for install, unless you're on Windows.
[06:03:21] <dale> Guest-liao: I believe you also need to run Emacs's "configure" script with --with-json.  See ./configure --help.  Make sure Emacs's configure script says it's going to build in JSON support at the end, before you do the whole make/make install thing.
[06:04:00] <Guest-liao> Okay. Let me check.

[15:01:17] <imdahmd> Hi, i'm here first time on this channel. I consider myself a beginner. My setup is vanilla emacs used on iterm (a flavour of terminal available on macos). I have run into a frustrating issue. I'm trying to use shift + movement keys (eg alt+f) to select text. But that does not work. I checked `shift-select-mode` and it is set to `t`. Can someone help me?
[15:03:41] <pjb> imdahmd: why don't you use emacsformacosx?  http://www.emacsformacosx.com
[15:04:01] <pjb> imdahmd: random keys cannot work in the terminal, there's no protocol to send them to the application.
[15:04:25] <pjb> imdahmd: more precisely, some protocols have been defined and may be at least partially implemented, but it's not generalized.
[15:04:51] <pjb> imdahmd: see: New keyboard protocol: https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/3248 http://www.leonerd.org.uk/hacks/fixterms/ https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/keyboard-protocol.html

[15:05:13] <EdwardIII> hey, i had a beer with leonerd in london

[15:08:41] <pjb> imdahmd: an alternative to emacsformacosx is to use emacs in X11, but unfortunately, the keyboard handing in X11.app is barely sufficient, but not good enough. For example, you cannot use xmodmap safely with X11.app, because it seems the keycodes are all messed up.  If you were on linux or ms-windows, I would definitely advise to use a X11 server and emacs in X11.  But on macOS, emacsformacosx is very nice, works flawelessly.

[15:18:06] <imdahmd> @pbj Thanks for the input and the references. I was hoping there were solutions to overcome these problems while working with emacs on terminal. I will switch to emacsformacosx.
[15:20:51] <pjb> imdahmd: the only solution would be to use other key bindings, that are transmitted by the usual terminal protocol.  In general, this will involve longer sequences. For example, I have those key binding for terminal use: https://github.com/informatimago/rc/blob/e3d8bbdb63a4907b94d88f6cc52404c2877f6d13/emacs-common.el#L780

[15:23:30] <imdahmd> I would much prefer sticking to the original sequences to make it easy for me to learn and stick to what is usually followed in the community.
[15:23:38] <afidegnum> pls care to resend the last posted message? I was disconnected
[15:24:32] <imdahmd> If i were to use emacsformacosx, is it possible to invoke a file open command from terminal so that it opens in the already open emacs gui?
[15:24:32] <bpalmer> imdahmd: I'm not sure what "original" means in this case, but C-SPC to start highlighting is reasonably short, and very standard.
[15:25:11] <bpalmer> imdahmd: you can then use C-g to cancel the region selection when you're done with it.
[15:25:22] <pjb> imdahmd: definitely, by the same mechanism: emacsclient.  M-x start-server RET in emacs (or (start-server) in ~/.emacs ) and emacsclient in the terminal.
[15:25:35] <imdahmd> @bpalmer By original i meant what is provided as a default sequence for an action by an extention such as smartparens
[15:26:14] <pjb> imdahmd: the point of emacs is that you can very easily customize the key chords to your needs.
[15:26:22] <bpalmer> imdahmd: most key sequences will work fine in a terminal, and most popular extensions will take care to provide bindings that work in a terminal.
[15:27:56] <artefact> yeah you hit terminal limits pretty quick. unless you use terminal-specific hacks
[15:28:04] <bpalmer> but, at any rate: pjb's advice is spot on that the most flexible input environment will generally come with the GUI, and you can use something like emacsclient and emacs server if you want.
[15:28:12] <artefact> good luck binding C-<backspace> in a terminal, for example
[15:28:57] <bpalmer> Sometimes if you wander in a terminal emulator (like iterm)'s settings, you can enable options that get more key sequences to work, but I don't know what options iterm provides.

[15:36:32] <artefact> ok, so terminal specifc hacks i mentioned. never mind, then
[15:37:43] <artefact> if you're doing that you might as well use gui emacs, as those tricks won't work when you don't have a graphical interface, eg in the linux console

[19:59:50] <acdw> ahhh
[20:00:11] <acdw> advise can be very helpful. my new config that i'm working on advises require, which .. is probably not a good idea
[20:00:14] <acdw> but is possible!
[20:00:30] <mfiano> and judging by your config I see you are at least somewhat familiar with CL :)
[20:00:39] <acdw> i know of it ;)
[20:00:50] <mfiano> Such as your eval-defun C-c C-c slime emulation
[20:00:53] <acdw> i read a bit of some of the books, it seems like a cool language

[20:03:10] <mfiano> I am curious why Emacs's auto-fill-mode is not behind a feature. All my setup blocks are either (setup (:require ...) ...) or (setup (:straight ...) ...), except that one

[20:04:02] <mfiano> Oh so mixed in with everything miscellaneous. That setup block might get large.
[20:04:06] <acdw> haha yes
[20:04:14] <acdw> some of mine are ... quite large, lol
[20:04:18] <mfiano> But there is no reason I can't split it up...it's just annoying
[20:04:58] <acdw> yes! indeed
[20:05:21] <mfiano> But man, setup.el is one of the best packages I've used, and that says a lot considering how simple it is. So long use-package!
[20:05:37] <mfiano> I am only the 4th person (including pkal) I know that uses it
[20:06:03] <acdw> oh wow really

[21:41:02] <acdw> mfiano : i think the newer one lets you define a function that then advises the other function, it's shorthand for the (defun ...) (advice-add 'function :after ...)
[21:41:07] <acdw> which is a common pattern
[21:41:18] <acdw> sometimes i just do (advice-add 'function :after (defun ...))
[21:41:28] <acdw> which also works, since defun returns the newly-created function object
[21:41:40] <mfiano> The new one expects an arglist
[21:41:51] <acdw> well yeah, all functions expect an arglist
[21:42:12] <mfiano> I mean the macro does as its 3rd argument, not the function.
[21:42:21] <mfiano> The macro doesnt take a function at all
[21:42:21] <acdw> right -- sorry, didn't mean to be so snarky
[21:42:24] <mfiano> That's the problem
[21:42:34] *** Joins: xlei (znc@pool-68-129-84-118.nycmny.fios.verizon.net)
[21:42:42] <acdw> the macro creates a function for you, which takes the arglist you pass to the macro
[21:43:11] <mfiano> Right so if I want to use an existing function rather than have it create one for me, I am better off use advice-add
[21:43:19] <acdw> oh, the older thing is in emacswiki under the new one: https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/SetupEl#h5o-11

[21:43:49] <acdw> tho really, that just saves you typing parens
[21:43:50] <mfiano> Oh pkal was just talking about adding that after he does a few things...guess he did already :)
[21:43:54] <mfiano> yep
[21:43:58] <acdw> ahhh haha
[21:44:09] <mfiano> I have a question
[21:44:13] <mfiano> unrelated to this
[21:44:20] <acdw> neat!
[21:45:39] <mfiano> Is there a macro that is like :load-after but not context aware? I basically want to add some setq forms after magit is already loaded, in the context of another package's setup, but don't want to defer loading said package until after magit is loaded - only defer the setq stuff
[21:46:10] <afidegnum> akater[m]: the issue here, is I have already declared a header argument for sql credentials already. repeating them inside the code, would be tedious. i'm looking for a way to pass the already declared values to the code block 
[21:46:15] <mfiano> I could just use with-eval-after-load, but was hoping for a nice concise macro
[21:46:22] <bpalmer> mfiano: I don't know precisely what you're doing, but that sounds like you want (with-eval-after-load (setq foo 1 bar 2))
[21:46:24] *** Joins: phillipvo (~user@97-113-49-86.tukw.qwest.net)

[21:47:19] <acdw> oh what bpalmer said, yeah
[21:47:50] <acdw> you could do (setup-define :with-eval-after-load (lambda (&rest body) `(with-eval-after-load ,@body))) if you like, really wanted to
[21:48:15] *** Quits: humky (~humky@user/humky) (Remote host closed the connection)

[21:48:44] <acdw> honeslty the biggest addition i've done with that is add a `with-eval-after-loads' macro, which chains multiple `w-e-a-l' together more easily
[21:48:47] <acdw> but that's it
[21:48:57] <acdw> mfiano it's okay! I've asked myself the same exact question many times
[21:49:21] <mfiano> Yeah that is what I'm after...
[21:49:38] <mfiano> (:eval-after (foo bar baz) ...) would be nice
[21:49:43] <mfiano> as a setup.el macro
[21:49:54] <mfiano> with :repeatable t
[21:50:34] <pkal> acdw: Just wrapping with-eval-after-load in a setup-defin is not worth it imo. You can just use the usual macro in that case
[21:50:38] <johnjay> ah well i can't compile emacs but at least i can run it
[21:50:52] <pkal> mfiano: How would it be repeatable?

[21:51:27] <mfiano> Maybe not repeatable, but it would take a &rest and auto nest multiple w-e-a-l forms
[21:51:44] <akater[m]> afidegnum: I don't deal with sql parameters but maybe :var x="value" will help.
[21:51:48] <acdw> pkal I agree
[21:51:54] <acdw> just saying ... you /could/ do it
[21:52:00] <acdw> like, you /could/ do anything, lol
[21:52:21] <artefact> can it prove p=np?
[21:52:29] <acdw> i think i started writing a setup-define for w-e-a-l one time and realized, this is just spinning wheels for no reason
[21:52:55] *** Quits: skapata (~Skapata@user/skapata) (Remote host closed the connection)
[21:53:41] <mfiano> Like if you wanted some code to be run after all of a set of things have been loaded, _that_ justifies a define-setup macro that nests the multiple w-e-a-l forms with your body on the inside of them all
[21:54:17] <grym> johnjay: F4 trick?
[21:54:44] <acdw> mfiano: I just wrote a regular macro (which... i mean, setup is kinda like that)
[21:55:13] <acdw> mfiano: https://tildegit.org/acdw/emacs/src/branch/main/lisp/acdw.el#L83
[21:55:15] <acdw> you could adapt that
[21:55:27] <acdw> which was actually adapted from pkal's reddit comment somewhere
[21:55:42] <acdw> b/c before that i had a complicated `waterfall' function thing that was too much
[21:56:14] <mfiano> setup.el gives me so many ideas because each define-setup macro can introspect the context of the parent hierarchy for features, modes, etc. It's mind boggling how expressive this can be, but I have no good macro ideas that aren't implementation or on the wiki yet
[21:56:37] <mfiano> like i implemented :hide-mode myself until i found the wiki :/
[21:57:09] <afidegnum> is it possible to use variable to link property values? #+property: header-args:sql+   :dbhost localhost :var dbhost ?
[21:57:43] <acdw> ahaha mfiano
[21:58:38] <pkal> acdw: I think I remember that comment. That was what https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/SetupEl#h5o-9 was based on
[21:59:50] <pkal> mfiano: Isn't that good? If you don't have anything you can think of implementing you are not lacking anything.

[23:51:40] <mfiano> acdw: Something like a :with-states for evil-mode states that would act similarly to :with-map would be useful.

[23:52:14] <acdw> Bayes: might be b/c imenu-generic-expression is a buffer-local variable, so you need to add it to a hook ?
[23:52:30] <acdw> like whatever mode you want to add that value in
[23:52:42] <Bayes> acdw oh :(  but I'd like to have it in every mode
[23:53:31] <mfiano> it would allow me to get rid of the general.el dependency. I'm not a huge fan of it.
