[06:51:31] <holycow> 50% offtopic link incoming
[06:51:38] <holycow> https://tic80.com/play?cart=2413
[06:51:47] <holycow> that game is a work of art
[06:51:52] <holycow> very peaceful
[06:52:10] <holycow> makes me inspired to keep on learning lisp and try to replicate that style here
[07:00:36] <ln43> holycow: is there a github link to the code?
[07:07:35] <holycow> well, you can do two things
[07:07:55] <holycow> 1) install tic80, run it, type surf and it will let you play it directly off the website
[07:08:20] <holycow> and if you press esc you enter the code / dev editor for code, graphics, sound, etc.
[07:08:34] <holycow> 2) install tic80 and download the cartridge from that page
[07:08:42] <holycow> then load up tic and load up that catridge
[07:08:54] <holycow> then press esc and enter the code / devi editor
[07:09:48] <holycow> tic80 has a github page for source code
[07:10:03] <holycow> the cartridge is the source it self, not sure if that author posted it there
[07:10:27] <holycow> you can find a binary tic80 installer here: https://nightly.link/nesbox/TIC-80/workflows/build/master
[07:10:53] <holycow> the tic80 github page doesn't have a debian installer, although you can easily compile it using the instructions on there obviously
[07:10:59] <holycow> i hope that helps
[07:11:15] <holycow> i was just really impressed with someone creating that on something like tic80 with such limited resources
[07:11:42] <holycow> he developed a custom 3d library for the tic80 to be able to render that.
[07:12:36] <holycow> or to put it another way, tic80 games can only be developed within the tic80 environment because it is supposed to emulate the full environment of an old school 8bit machine or something arbitrary like that
[07:13:10] <holycow> unless you buy a tic80 license for like $5 in which case you can dev in whatever editor you want aparently.
[07:13:33] <holycow> hopefully that answers all possible questions.  i'm not associated with any of those projects, i just love art.
[07:13:59] <|3b|> https://github.com/pke1029/GO21-Beyond-the-UnderGround seems to be that game
[07:15:28] <holycow> oh!
[07:15:30] <holycow> aha!
[07:15:48] <holycow> `well ... your one sentence replaces my 40 lines of gibberish
[07:15:50] <holycow> ehe
