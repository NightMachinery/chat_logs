[09:22:16] <NeoVoid[m]> Is rss bad news?
[09:22:20] <NeoVoid[m]> * Is RSS bad news?
[11:48:42] <pystardust> NeoVoid[m]: yes so, basically if some one sends you a bad contructed bad response then you can eat up the memory of your rss parser, rss is fine if you trust the source
[11:51:10] <NeoVoid[m]> pystardust: hmm
[14:48:01] <pystardust> encrypted messages in irc! http://0x0.st/-hyG.png (I used znc's crypt, most bouncers support this protocol)
[14:48:36] <pystardust> so first both users share their keys using keysend and then the chat (here I didn't send one key to show the encryption)
[14:51:12] <pystardust> gtlsgamr SurajKushwah[m] ^
[14:52:25] <gtlsgamr> pystardust: is it like end to end?
[14:52:31] <pystardust> Yes
[14:52:49] <pystardust> https://wiki.znc.in/Crypt
[14:53:28] <gtlsgamr> But I personally don't see the need for it
[14:53:35] <gtlsgamr> who tf uses encrypted IRC XD
[14:56:50] <pystardust> Yeah true, but there is an option
[14:57:34] <pystardust> I dont think its e2e, its e2e from the bouncer i suppose
[14:58:13] <pystardust> But there must be client which could do it by default
[15:06:57] <pystardust> gtlsgamr: it actually a well established thing http://ultrx.net/doc/fish/
[15:53:04] <NeoVoid[m]> I was talking about this with pystardust
[15:53:05] <NeoVoid[m]> http://lowlife@45.79.250.220
[15:53:05] <NeoVoid[m]> if we could make something like this for website
[15:58:52] <pystardust> looks cool but I doubt if its practical, very vew people would even access it like this, we could have a thread, but to avoid spam we would need email or something
[16:54:27] <pystardust> this thing looks cool https://peertube.co.uk/videos/watch/8501fbf3-188d-4c6e-97ae-68cf9a86f70f 
[16:54:32] <pystardust> game on git
[17:28:09] <Glizzster[m]> what utility you guys use to flash iso on usb? i used to use balena etcher but its kinda bloated
[17:33:14] <pystardust> Glizzster[m]: you can use cat, cp, dd. Here is explination on how to use them https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/USB_flash_installation_medium#In_GNU/Linux
[17:33:43] <Glizzster[m]> which one you prefer most?
[17:35:42] <pystardust> i do dd cause it shows progress. I suggest that. But even cp and cat work the same
[17:35:58] <Glizzster[m]> oh, tysm man
[17:35:59] <pystardust> double check your drive letter!
[17:36:12] <Glizzster[m]> yaaa :)
[17:46:54] <Arya[m]> if you are using dd set bs=15M or bs=8192
[17:47:03] <Arya[m]> without them dd is really slow
[17:53:01] <pystardust> Arya[m]: the speeds vs bs is hardware dependent, they gave 4M cause it works decent in most hardwares
[20:00:32] <JB[m]> <Glizzster[m]> "what utility you guys use to..." <- Use dd sir!
[20:07:29] <NeoVoid[m]> <pystardust> "this thing looks cool https://..." <- whats good forgit or magit?
[20:08:09] <NeoVoid[m]> * whats good forgit or magit?
[20:17:04] <pystardust> NeoVoid[m]: i dont use either of them so cant comment. I am satisfied with git it self

[20:51:33] <sla[m]12> frend recommended me binance but he don't care about privacy and stuff, is there any other sane options
[20:53:00] <sla[m]12> * sane options or shoud i go with that
