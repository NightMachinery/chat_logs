[09:15:38] <panella32> Can you pls let me know why windows annoys me with "The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process."?
[09:18:43] *** Quits: JC5 (~X@user/jc5) (Quit: Bye)
[09:22:00] <Blondie101010> panella32:  try the exact command in cmd
[09:22:19] <Blondie101010> that should fail the same way, but it'll give you a closer perspective
[09:23:01] <Blondie101010> because PHP is not involved in this
[09:25:42] <panella32> Blondie101010 you mean something like this? exec($cmd1, $output1, $ret1);
[09:28:11] <Blondie101010> no, something like: start /B 'youtube-dl --no-check-certificate -o "./foo/bar/%(title)s.%(ext)s" -a "./foo/bar/file1.txt"'  1> ./worthless1.txt 2>&1
[09:34:32] <panella32> Ah.. Sorry these days I see every word as a function or a command!
[09:34:45] <panella32> Tried the exact same command in cmd and worked well
[09:35:39] <panella32> Also tried using passthru and exec and both also worked well.
[09:36:07] <panella32> exec($cmd1, $output1, $ret1) and passthru($cmd1, $output1);
[09:38:10] <Blondie101010> then what was the problem?
[09:38:19] <panella32> Blondie101010 I wonder why pclose(popen("start /B " . $cmd2 . " 1> ./zz2.txt 2>&1 &", "r")); command throws ""The process cannot access the file"?
[09:38:27] <Blondie101010> is it maybe because it was run in the background?
[09:39:08] <panella32> yes the command is supposed to be run in the background (I don't use exec/passthru at all here)
[09:39:40] <panella32> The actuall code is here ofc simplified https://3v4l.org/NcT80
[09:41:29] <panella32> so just to be more clear, why exec can access the file but pclose(popen(...)) can't?
[09:43:24] <Blondie101010> read the first paragraph: https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.popen.php
[09:43:38] <Blondie101010> it forks
[09:44:45] <panella32> sorry but I really don't understand it well enough. What it means? Fork?
[09:46:01] <Blondie101010> frankly, the technicalities are not so important...  both are similar, but not identical
[09:47:00] <panella32>  So I have no chance to use popen? any solution you suggest me to apply and move on? I'm out of idea tbh
[09:47:49] <Blondie101010> what happens if you drop the '&' at the end?
[09:48:33] <panella32> honestly I don't understand that command at all! Just copy/paste'd lol
[09:48:34] <panella32> Let me try..
[09:50:00] <panella32> still same
[09:50:14] <Blondie101010> is that the full error message?
[09:50:41] <TML> panella32: Your OS is telling you "You have two programs trying to write to the same file at the same time, and I don't allow that."
[09:51:18] <panella32> Blondie101010 yes.
[09:51:55] <TML> something - probably the program "start" in this case - is obtaining a lock on the file
[09:52:06] <panella32> TML I fclose() it and the only command is going to 'read from' the file is youtube-dl
[09:52:35] <panella32> and also why not throw anything if I use exec?
[09:52:39] *** Quits: echoSMILE (uid504326@user/echosmile) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[09:52:39] <TML> panella32: Calling fclose() from PHP doesn't do you any good when you have a backgrounded process running outside of PHP that's locking the file
[09:53:10] <panella32> you right sir
[09:53:30] <panella32> can I remove the ''start"?
[09:53:41] <TML> panella32: My suggestion would be to stop calling exec() or popen() from PHP at all
[09:53:53] <TML> Have PHP write the commands you want executed into a database
[09:54:37] <TML> Have a process not part of the HTTP request chain that wakes up, takes the first "unprocessed" record from the database, processes it, marks it as "processed" in the database, and then goes back to sleep
[09:54:56] <TML> (or, instead of going back to sleep, it can fetch the next "unprocessed" record)
[09:56:50] <panella32> You absolutely right. You can tell this is the right strategy and the best way to look at it, but honestly using a db is beyond what I'm doing and what I literally can do. It's a very basic encrypted-hls downloader

[09:57:54] <panella32> As a very elementry php user I think a mediocre approach like using exec inside the script for now may works fine for me, as it already does on macOS.
[09:58:08] <TML> Using a database doesn't need to be a difficult task, but it WILL require you to get out of the habit of just copying and pasting random code snippets from the internet and hoping they work
[09:58:28] <TML> You're going to have to start examining the snippets, taking them apart, understanding how and why they work
[09:59:56] <TML> panella32: Well, it's simply advice. I can't force you to change. You are free to take any parts of it you choose and ignore the rest. Just don't expect too much assistance from me if you go the "ignore" route. :)
[10:03:48] *** Joins: JC5x (~X@user/jc5)
[10:06:18] <TML> if your goal is just to make the code run without understanding anything more than you do today, and without fixing the underlying architecture to a more reasonable and sustainable model, then it sounds like you already have a solution based on exec()
[10:06:45] <panella32> so sorry someone called me twice in 5min!! Couldn't be more agree on that. But honestly If I ever intended to be a (php) coder, I'd go for a course on Treehouse right away and never even try to waste your and other great guys' time at all. But let me tell you the truth, I'm a very ordinary user mostly away from anything CLI and sometimes I do some basic stuff on mac's lovely terminal and try some interesting github stuff! I'm not a power user and I
[10:06:45] <panella32>  don't want to be! Also can't do almost anything right on linux terminal! I think this copy/paste approach is chip I agree but it works fine for me!
[10:07:26] <panella32> cheap*
[10:08:31] <panella32> TML Thanks for you great insight.
[10:08:40] <panella32> exec does it but not sadly in the background. I want it to be run in bg as it does on mac
[10:10:35] <TML> Well, if you literally don't want to get any better, I am probably the wrong person to assist you. I'm terrible at spoon-feeding answers to problems, I'm more of a "teach you how to learn life-long programming skills" type. Best of luck, though.
[10:15:43] <panella32> TML Thanks again. Sorry If I'm not a right person to learn through that standard route. btw If I finish this small project probably my next one will be mid 2022! I'm not coding regularly that's why I don't prefer to go and understand what popen actually does. You may be not agree but sometimes through this copy/pasting stuff you can learn lots of stuff you already didn't know at all! I understand this type of learning is not the best one but honestly in
[10:15:44] <panella32>  his own levels it teaches some!
[10:16:46] <TML> well, we'll just have to agree to disagree on that point :)
[10:17:07] <panella32> agreed :)
[10:17:50] <panella32> I think my php is as funky as my english if not more!
[10:29:44] <panella32> TinoDidriksen AllenJB Blondie101010 Naktibalda please come and save my day! Time passes and I literally can do nothing to make the code working fine!
[10:33:28] <Blondie101010> it's not a matter of patching...  it's a matter of understanding
[10:34:11] <Blondie101010> if I wanted to do a quick and dirty solution like that, I'd do it in bash
[10:35:54] <Blondie101010> it's simpler to use for process control and IO redirections
[10:38:26] <panella32> you mean the whole script on bash?
[10:38:32] <Blondie101010> yes
[10:38:52] <panella32> it's good enough to do https request and stuff like that?
[10:39:10] <Blondie101010> you could probably make use of some parallel utility too, but that's not necessary
[10:39:32] <Blondie101010> your code does not do http requests, you call a program that does
[10:40:05] <panella32> It does. using curl I send 2get and one post
[10:40:41] <Blondie101010> ok then you use the curl binary (command)
[10:40:43] <panella32> The code is almost 560lines! That paste above is just a part of that

[11:41:16] <panella32> The txt file that windows whining about was already got closed using fclose() before getting read from by popen(ytdl command) as you saw in the 3v4l file above, but still, windows 'the pain of coding', didn't let any process to 'read' from it.
[11:41:23] <panella32> Now solved. Long story short, I had to bring all other non-related fclose() commands (9 ones) before the popen command and literally close any open file. Now pclose(popen("start /B " . $cmd2 . " 1> ./zz2.txt 2>&1 &", "r")); runs without accessing issues.

[17:06:44] <relipse> What does this mean
[17:06:48] <relipse>  php7.4-curl : Depends: libcurl3 (>= 7.44.0) but it is not installable
[17:06:48] <relipse> E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.
[17:07:10] <relipse> how do I install curl mod/package for php 7.4
[17:07:51] <AllenJB> I would ask in your distros channel. This is a problem with distro package management.
[17:08:27] <AllenJB> My guess is there's additional output you haven't shown that attempts to explain the problem. It would likely be helpful to pastebin the full output.
[17:09:57] <relipse> PHP Fatal error:  Uncaught Exception: Stripe needs the CURL PHP extension.
[17:10:52] <relipse> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/EznG3ABd/
[17:11:03] <relipse> hmm, how do i fix this
[17:11:28] <Naktibalda> upgrade libcurl3
[17:11:37] <relipse> Naktibalda: I already have libcurl 4
[17:11:45] <relipse> it won't let me install libcurl 3
[17:11:55] <Naktibalda> probably that's the problem
[17:12:09] <relipse> guess i'm getting rid of stripe
[17:13:47] <AllenJB> You could like for an alternative stripe library that doesn't use curl (eg. uses guzzle).
[17:14:01] <AllenJB> Running PHP without the curl extension is kind of weird tho IMO

[21:58:37] <omegatron> relipse: I don't remember .. I installed about 20k packages in the past 2 years on several machines ..
[21:58:37] <relipse> because when I typed in my question i wanted a lecture
[21:58:52] <relipse> ok fine I did some googling
[21:58:59] <Blondie101010> you insisted after I said it's off topic
[21:59:00] <relipse> debian 10 buster comes with 7.3
[21:59:24] <Blondie101010> it's not a php problem at all
[21:59:25] <relipse> 7.3 requires libcurl 3
[21:59:31] <relipse> so what no ones doing anything
[21:59:45] <relipse> everyone is idling, might as well ask some php programmers who might have encountered it before
[21:59:47] <Blondie101010> so ask on your favorite channel: #debian
[21:59:52] <relipse> i already did
[21:59:57] <Blondie101010> lol
[22:00:34] <__adrian> relipse: asking on the on-topic channel is the better approach. you might ask here if anyone would like to help answer your question on that on-topic channel
[22:00:43] <Blondie101010> even if they give you the steps to fix your issue, you still won't make *any* effort to learn the package manager
[22:01:00] <relipse> i know enough about apt-get to get around
[22:01:05] <Blondie101010> no
[22:01:08] <Blondie101010> you didn't solve this
[22:01:10] <__adrian> well, obviously not in this case?
[22:01:17] <Blondie101010> and it is a package manager question
[22:01:18] <relipse> i already told you the answer
[22:01:19] <tirnanog> must be using unofficial repositories, for one thing.
[22:01:26] <Blondie101010> indeed
[22:01:33] <Blondie101010> but that is *normal* with php
[22:01:33] <relipse> yeah I must have used an unofficial repo to get 7.4 on my debian 10
[22:01:47] <relipse> so now I have to use an unofficial repo to get libcurl 4
[22:02:01] <tirnanog> between that and having held broken packages, the problem is likely therein. not that I'm a debian expert.
[22:02:02] <Blondie101010> that's a possible approach
[22:02:06] <omegatron> and unfortunately I cannot help with package manager-related stuff, as my machines don't have one  -_-
[22:02:23] <biberu> didn't you say you needed libcurl3?
[22:02:25] <relipse> https://serverfault.com/questions/1017555/debian-cannot-install-php7-4-curl-depends-not-installable
[22:02:48] <relipse> my system is telling me I need libcurl 3
[22:02:51] <Blondie101010> do you understand every line apt-get outputs?
[22:03:02] <Blondie101010> do you understand the real conflict?
[22:03:19] <Blondie101010> that's how real troubleshooting must be done if you want to learn
[22:03:42] <Blondie101010> it usually involves removing/replacing some of them to get others to pass
[22:08:36] <tirnanog> relipse: which repo are you using?
[22:09:42] <Blondie101010> probably not Ondrej's
[22:09:52] <tirnanog> right.
[22:10:10] <BadAdviceCat> I can't imagine this happening with Ondrej's stuff.
[22:10:27] <tirnanog> libcurl4 (>= 7.56.1). yep, looks fine to me.
[22:10:46] <Blondie101010> well it's hard to be perfect, but Ondrej and Remi are pretty careful
[22:10:57] <tirnanog> who's Remi?
[22:11:13] <tirnanog> never mind. looked it up.
[22:11:17] <BadAdviceCat> :)
[22:12:43] <relipse> Anyone install php 8.1 on ubuntu?
[22:12:53] <relipse> or is this an #ubuntu question?
[22:13:26] <Blondie101010> it would be *more* appropriate there
[22:13:36] <Blondie101010> formulated a bit differently
[22:14:12] <Blondie101010> but if you read the current conversation, you'd have really good hints on what to look for
[22:14:14] <omegatron> you mean "Anyone here installed php 8.1 on ubuntu?"
[22:14:21] <omegatron> =D
[22:14:39] <__adrian> tl;dr: use ondrej's ppa
[22:14:46] <tirnanog> I would imagine that, at the very least, someone using Ondrej's repo has, given that it exists there and that he also has PPAs for Ubuntu.
[22:15:11] <relipse> yeah i followed all the steps and i got php 8.1 on the command line but it won't get enabled in apache for some reason
[22:15:20] <relipse> yes I restarted apache
[22:15:21] <Blondie101010> check your apache config
[22:15:32] <relipse> k
[22:15:34] <Blondie101010> I think I must have told you that 10 times in the past week
[22:17:38] <relipse> the issue is that there are a lot of files in the apache configuration
[22:17:52] <relipse> apache2.conf didn't have anything
[22:18:01] <relipse> do you mean in sites-enabled?
[22:18:18] <Blondie101010> relipse:  once you put in the effort to learn how to read the apache config, the next time, you'll be able to troubleshoot your issues without random searches
[22:18:52] <Blondie101010> you start at the base, the main config file which does includes
[22:18:55] <relipse> is everything you say condescending or...
[22:18:57] <Blondie101010> read it
[22:19:05] <tirnanog> a2dismod php7.3 && a2enmod php8.1 ... maybe.
[22:19:05] <Blondie101010> and consult their manual
[22:19:22] <tirnanog> also, ondrej recommends to use his apache2 ppa. not sure if that's required, though.
[22:19:56] <tirnanog> replace php7.3 with whatever version of php ubuntu may already have provided there.

[22:33:31] <tirnanog> so, there's no php-fpm instance running. or, none that's reachable on the socket path shown. if using php-fpm, this is not something to be fixed inside of apache but outside of it.
[22:35:53] <relipse> i've never used php fpm before
[22:35:57] <relipse> locally that is
[22:36:06] <relipse> i don't mind if I do
[22:36:12] <relipse> but what should I do tirnanog
[22:36:31] <Blondie101010> make sure that you have php-fpm running and using that socket
[22:36:44] <Blondie101010> is it running?
[22:36:49] <tirnanog> right. configure php-fpm-8.1 to use that socket for (at least) one pool and start the service.
[22:38:23] <tirnanog> you would need to have installed the php-fpm package from the repo also. it should provide a systemd service.
[22:38:52] <Blondie101010> any howto that include "apache" and "php-fpm" should give you pretty clear instructions on what you're missing
[22:39:22] <relipse> sweet this worked: sudo service php8.1-fpm start
[22:39:34] <relipse> thanks tirnanog and Blondie101010
[22:40:53] <tirnanog> note that it won't start upon booting unless you also enable it.

[23:04:43] <Blondie101010> or you could try to *learn* stuff
[23:05:03] <relipse> i've been searching internet as well
[23:05:04] <omegatron> I use apache + php-fpm, but not because of some openssl bug ..
[23:05:29] <Blondie101010> it is a sane config

[23:05:46] <omegatron> well, plug in a real mouse ..
[23:05:58] <tirnanog> BadAdviceCat: ok. good to know (nginx user here).
[23:06:00] <relipse> i just rebooted, kind of ticked me off
[23:06:28] <biberu> central red rubber mouse button? do you mean a track point?
[23:06:49] <relipse> yeah that's what it's called
[23:08:08] <BadAdviceCat> tirnanog, as an nginx user, you might be interested in Nginx's Unit. https://www.nginx.com/products/nginx-unit/ :D - Long story short, an alternative to PHP-FPM, which also handles nodejs, python, go, ruby, java, and perl. :)
[23:08:26] <tirnanog> BadAdviceCat: that does sound intriguing. thanks!
[23:08:39] <BadAdviceCat> Apache users can use this too, it's just a matter of telling reverse proxies to use Unit, instead of FPM.
[23:09:45] <BadAdviceCat> I configured php7 and 8 on that. One day, I might one day find a use for nodejs and python.
[23:12:13] <tirnanog> I'd have a use for perl. but, also, I'm interested in seeing how it stacks up against php-fpm as a php supervisor.

[23:18:18] <relipse> i made a 4-player chess in nodejs
[23:18:42] <relipse> i wish you could mix php and nodejs at times but oh well
[23:20:13] <Blondie101010> so nodejs allowed you to change chess rules?
[23:20:36] <Blondie101010> semi-kidding
[23:20:50] <BadAdviceCat> LMAO.
[23:20:54] <Blondie101010> I made multi-player games in PHP
[23:21:31] <omegatron> what kind of comment is that?
[23:21:42] <Blondie101010> which one?
[23:21:47] <omegatron> yours
[23:21:58] <Blondie101010> still don't see which one
[23:22:08] <omegatron> "so nodejs allowed you to change chess rules?"
[23:22:16] <Blondie101010> "4-player chess"
[23:22:47] <relipse> it was a server that allowed 4 players to join and chat and play
[23:22:55] <omegatron> yes, it's a variant of chess
[23:23:02] <Blondie101010> what's the point of that limit?
[23:23:04] <omegatron> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-player_chess
[23:23:24] <BadAdviceCat> relipse, You kinda can using message queue to make code execute in other languages, or use the exec() functions available in each languages if it supports it.
[23:23:34] <omegatron> just because you never heard of it ..
[23:23:43] <Blondie101010> omegatron:  that was not the point
[23:23:47] <BadAdviceCat> It's easier to just make it so that you use 1 language per component within a project.
[23:24:06] <omegatron> oh I see - maybe you want to clarify
[23:24:06] <BadAdviceCat> omegatron, it's just a joke. xD
[23:24:17] <omegatron> hmm
[23:25:01] <Blondie101010> the bottom line point would have been that you can do the same in any complete programming language
[23:25:05] <relipse> Ok, So, I'm getting a Fatal error: Uncaught Error: Class "NumberFormatter" not  found, I searched and found to use sudo apt-get install php8.1-intl, which I did. I restarted apache and I'm still getting the same error, is this because i'm using php fpm ? Apologies I am new to php-fpm
[23:25:12] <omegatron> sure you can
[23:25:26] <relipse> the way node created connections to the players was something php couldn't do though
[23:25:34] <BadAdviceCat> Technically, rules are changed when making a 4-player chess, and technically, nodejs allows one to do that, because of it's dynamic nature, developers are free to decide how to implement something
[23:25:35] <relipse> had to poll or something
[23:25:41] <Blondie101010> no, that just made it easier for YOU to find examples
[23:25:51] <tirnanog> relipse: apache is not responsible for php in your setup. php-fpm is.
[23:25:51] <BadAdviceCat> Of course, nodejs is not the only "dynamic" language.
[23:26:26] <tirnanog> relipse: so, should you ever need to respawn your pool of php processes, restarting php-fpm is what would be required.
[23:26:36] <relipse> ok thanks tirnanog
[23:27:18] <Blondie101010> relipse:  poll vs push is a huge decision choice
[23:27:27] <BadAdviceCat> The primary point is that the chess game can also be written in PHP, too.
[23:27:47] <Blondie101010> s/decision/design/
[23:27:49] <relipse> BadAdviceCat: with connections to the clients like that?
[23:28:08] <Blondie101010> use the protocol you want
[23:28:15] <Blondie101010> if you want websockets, use that
[23:28:35] <Blondie101010> PHP like any other complete programming language, can implement the protocol
[23:28:38] <BadAdviceCat> relipse, yes. PHP doesn't only work in the traditional stateless http protocol.
[23:29:02] <relipse> BadAdviceCat: do you have any examples of simple games like pong or something written in php
[23:29:07] <relipse> with chat and clients
[23:29:11] <Blondie101010> see, "examples"
[23:29:22] <Blondie101010> I'd advise to learn to read instead
[23:29:24] <relipse> i see you typed "examples" thats about it
[23:29:48] <Blondie101010> relipse:  when you only operate by example, you don't learn anything that you use
[23:30:06] <relipse> thanks can you stop teaching me, i really don't want you to be my teacher,
[23:30:17] <relipse> go to school or something if you want ot teach people
[23:30:22] <BadAdviceCat> relipse, the point here is that rather than only relying on examples, make a list of what is technically required to do what you just did in nodejs. You've used websockets for that game, right?
[23:30:40] <relipse> yeah websockets
[23:30:47] <Blondie101010> considering that you apparently learned nothing in the past decade, based on what I've seen here and on #debian, I don't think it's a teacher problem
[23:31:20] <BadAdviceCat> relipse, now the next step is to implement websockets in PHP. To figure out how the communication is done. There may even be a library available for this.
[23:31:21] <Blondie101010> learn to research and read about what you want to learn

[23:32:26] <Blondie101010> but push vs pull does involve a drastic design difference
[23:32:59] <BadAdviceCat> Just like I had to learn the IRC protocol when I wanted to make my IRC bot in python because there are no built-in functions to connect to IRC in python, with examples on doing such things.
[23:33:07] <Blondie101010> with the pull approach, part of your main model is in the front end
[23:33:19] <Blondie101010> with push it's the opposite
[23:33:33] <BadAdviceCat> I had to learn that it's not /msg, it's /privmsg
[23:34:09] <BadAdviceCat> And you can't just type the message in. You must use : or the command will not do what you expect. As in /privmsg php-bot :Hello

[23:38:58] <Blondie101010> the UI part is another story
