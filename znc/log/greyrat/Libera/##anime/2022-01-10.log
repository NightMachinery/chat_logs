[01:38:29] <Nanobot> Five Tips For Writing Amateur Erotic Fiction: Tip 1. As you softly caress the supple keys with the tips of your hard, throbbing fingers, you should recall the thrilling sensation of being on the receiving end of the Internet's erotic literature. Tip 2. As the supple letters passionately appear on the supple screen, passionately caressing your supple eyeballs, you should remember that thesauruses passionately exist. Tip 3. As your rigid fingers continue to 
[01:38:29] <Nanobot> stroke the tender keys, remember that subtle variations can turn repetition into something more stimulating. Tip 4. As you resume typing, your keystrokes becoming faster and faster with each titillating sentence, you may realize you've been softly inserting "as" into the front of nearly every phrase. Better switch it up. Tip 5. While intoxicatingly trying to exhilaratingly come up with new arousing descriptive words, you may be tempted to think you can't 
[01:38:30] <Nanobot> reuse adjectives you've already used before. If you're that rigid, you'll come across as desparate.
[01:43:10] <Fenderbassist> ButterNoodle: in regards to modern "pirate radio", I found this interesting
[01:43:16] <Fenderbassist> Pirate Cat Radio in San Francisco, broadcasting on FM 87.9 and TV channel 13,  is a good example of what the possibilities are today for small, pirate radio stations to exist in both the digital and analog worlds simultaneously. Pirate Cat is ‚Äútechnically‚Äù an unlicensed station. In their defense they say that; ‚ÄúWe believe that Title 47 Section 73.3542 of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations
[01:43:17] <Nanobot> This is almost like a perfectly scripted conversation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4wccS5u-eU
[01:43:18] <Fenderbassist> currently allows Pirate Cat Radio 87.9fm to legally broadcast without a formal license from the FCC.‚Äù Title 47 gives unlicensed stations the right to operate when there is an emergency or the country is at war and since we are now supposedly in a state of ‚Äúnever ending war‚Äù they remain unchallenged by the government.

[02:16:22] <ButterNoodle> Fenderbassist: yea the FCC rarely enforces
[02:16:35] <ButterNoodle> I prefer short wave pirate stations tbh
[02:17:58] <ButterNoodle> since that fm station will barely get out of the SF area
[02:18:37] <Fenderbassist> yes I can see your point
[02:19:01] <ButterNoodle> in the higher bands you can pick up station around the world
[02:19:10] <Fenderbassist> I like the idea, just like in the 60s, of pirate radio online or on the air getting out stuff that the mainstream ignores
[02:19:18] <Fenderbassist> cool
[02:19:18] <ButterNoodle> oh yea
[02:19:30] <Fenderbassist> mainstream is so stale imho
[02:19:44] <ButterNoodle> u hear about cuba jamming some bands during their recent issues

[02:20:21] <Fenderbassist> indeed
[02:20:37] <ButterNoodle> people were turning to ham radio to communicate with the outside world
[02:21:11] <Fenderbassist> yes there's usually a way....BBSes were used similarly in the past
[02:21:22] <Fenderbassist> because the phones still worked
[02:21:55] <Fenderbassist> and yes setting up a ham radio if you have the gear is pretty easy
[02:22:25] <ButterNoodle> you can make a transmitter pretty ez from parts

[02:49:23] <Fenderbassist> I don't know if that's possible given the bt frequency range being low, but it's such short range I think you'd be better off not

[02:51:41] <MootPoot> rich
[02:52:11] <MootPoot> the most expensive clothing item I own is a motorcycle jacket for about 600
[02:52:23] <amigojapan> MootPoot: to just be worn once
[02:52:36] <MootPoot> I hear that's common in a lot of places
[02:52:41] <MootPoot> wedding dresses are a big one
[02:52:55] <amigojapan> True
[02:55:20] <amigojapan> MootPoot: one of my student's mother's got into a fight with her husband cause he is not Japanese and she bought one of these for her daughter
[02:55:35] <MootPoot> why?
[02:55:45] <MootPoot> too much money spent?
[02:55:58] <amigojapan> Why? He thought it was too much money to spend
[02:56:20] <amigojapan> They are not rich
[02:56:43] <amigojapan> MootPoot: she like spent their entire savings on that
[02:56:55] <MootPoot> oof
[02:56:58] <MootPoot> yeah okay
[02:56:59] <MootPoot> that's dumb
[02:57:08] <amigojapan> Yup
[02:57:22] <MootPoot> if they had the money to spend then sure, whatever but
[02:57:36] <MootPoot> if thats all of their savings for just some artifically overpriced cloth - 
[02:57:46] <ButterNoodle> I'd pay 6K for a kimono as long as a cute girl came with it
[02:57:51] <MootPoot> same
[02:57:54] <MootPoot> can I keep it forever
[02:57:59] <ButterNoodle> sounds like a bargain if u ask me
[02:58:12] <MootPoot> have to take into account runnings costs
[02:58:16] <ButterNoodle> remember MootPoot.. used good lose their resale value
[02:58:21] <ButterNoodle> might as well keep it
[02:58:23] <MootPoot> food, water, furniture
[02:58:29] <ButterNoodle> yea
[02:58:34] <ButterNoodle> dont forget 1/2 a house
[02:58:54] <ButterNoodle> they all get 1/2 a house here
[02:59:04] <amigojapan> MootPoot: she also did not tell him until it was bought
[02:59:22] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: really depends on how the finances are ran..
[02:59:38] <MootPoot> me and butter's finances are pretty clear
[02:59:43] <MootPoot> he buys his shit I buy mine
[02:59:49] <MootPoot> ez pz
[02:59:51] <ButterNoodle> if they are 1/2 and 1/2 on running the finances.. then there should have been a discussion
[02:59:57] <MootPoot> we onle meet up to watch anime
[03:00:05] <ButterNoodle> and sex MootPoot..
[03:00:10] <MootPoot> anime sex
[03:00:30] <Fenderbassist> do you guys all take vitamin D?
[03:00:39] <MootPoot> I give vitamin D
[03:00:48] <Fenderbassist> I recommend it
[03:00:59] <Fenderbassist> 5000 IUs is what my doctor had me take
[03:01:01] <MootPoot> jokes aside I hear that I should take it - especially since i get like 0 sunlight a day
[03:01:07] <Fenderbassist> ditto
[03:01:10] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: but otherwise if she runs the finances like most shufu.. then he cant get mad just because he was made aware
[03:01:11] <Fenderbassist> made a big difference
[03:01:21] <Fenderbassist> and is known to reduce covid symptoms
[03:01:40] <ButterNoodle> I run the finances..
[03:01:51] <Fenderbassist> so I recommend all consider taking D safely, and if possible have a doctor test your level
[03:01:53] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: I am not sure if she works or not
[03:01:54] <ButterNoodle> the wife just asks if she can spend on a big ticket item
[03:02:11] <ButterNoodle> I say yes or no based on discretionary spending funds
[03:03:04] <MootPoot> last time I asked for a giant onahole you said no :3
[03:03:08] <ButterNoodle> but.. I dont tell her if I'm going to make another 1000$ purchase unless she asks what that new shiny thing is

[03:13:16] <ButterNoodle> and she hates them
[03:13:39] <ButterNoodle> so I take her to get glasses
[03:13:41] <ButterNoodle> and not contacts
[03:13:47] <ButterNoodle> and wife gets pissed off..
[03:13:49] <ButterNoodle> idc
[03:13:53] <ButterNoodle> dont waste
[03:14:09] <Fenderbassist> ButterNoodle: don't blame you, at that point sense has to prevail
[03:14:18] <ButterNoodle> dont buy a $200 air fryer and leave it in the box for 2 years either
[03:14:27] <MootPoot> I buy a lot of shit but I use almost everything
[03:14:33] <MootPoot> air fryer = overpriced oven
[03:14:42] <ButterNoodle> then ask why I dont approve of buying other gimmick-ey kitchen shit
[03:14:44] <MootPoot> my parents are really b ad for that
[03:14:49] <ButterNoodle> that will stay in the box
[03:14:51] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: are you me
[03:14:58] <ButterNoodle> its pretty common
[03:14:58] <MootPoot> thats EXACTLY what they do
[03:15:02] <ButterNoodle> I dont
[03:15:07] <MootPoot> buy gimmicky kitchen shit
[03:15:10] <MootPoot> use it once or never
[03:15:15] <MootPoot> then it takes up counter space
[03:15:21] <MootPoot> and they get mad at me for moving it 
[03:15:25] <ButterNoodle> I use what I buy.. unless I am stockpiling bullet components or computer parts
[03:15:34] <ButterNoodle> lol
[03:15:55] <ButterNoodle> she bought a humidifier.. it literally sat in the box for almost 2 years
[03:15:59] <Satin> I use almost everything I buy
[03:16:11] <Satin>  haven't yet assembled that bookshelf though
[03:16:13] <MootPoot> I think the logic of the kitchen thing is like
[03:16:13] <Fenderbassist> Satin: how's yoru health?
[03:16:14] <ButterNoodle> I use one every night bc I need one to sleep and breathe
[03:16:18] <Fenderbassist> your*
[03:16:20] <ButterNoodle> mine dies...
[03:16:33] <MootPoot> food = mandatory = thing that helps with food = mandatory by extension = some kind of shitty rationalization 
[03:16:36] <ButterNoodle> I take that one, and she freaks the fuck out about me taking something she planned on using
[03:16:56] <ButterNoodle> show her the amazon order from 18 months ago
[03:16:58] <Satin> Fenderbassist: oh just saw the ping - I'm a bit groggy after waking up so late, but yeah. Uh. I've been eating these past few days for sure. Made some ground meat Indian dish, didn't turn out perfect, but it was close.
[03:17:13] * MootPoot has secret plans to sell some kitchen appliances
[03:17:30] <ButterNoodle> she went and got another... its out of the box and hasnt been used in 6 months
[03:17:35] <Satin> I made it with something called parathas, so I guess the carbs from that def kicked me out of ketosis at some point but yeah. Had a hard off day yesterday from excercise and what not.

[03:17:36] <MootPoot> Satin: spicing ground beef and making it well is really some kind of mystical art
[03:17:39] <MootPoot> I never got it right
[03:17:41] <Satin> I'm about the same in general
[03:17:44] <Fenderbassist> Satin: good, the one thing I don't want you to do is wear yourself out exercising without adequate nutrition, and then get sick....that is a very bad combo
[03:17:51] <MootPoot> amigojapan: looks expensive
[03:17:59] <Fenderbassist> Satin: what I want you to do is keep healthy and pace yourself so that you can fight off infection
[03:18:05] <amigojapan> Yup MootPoot 
[03:18:05] <Satin> MootPoot: It's more my dumb ass didn't remember I bought 2.1 lbs of meat, which is more than 500 grams used in the recipie
[03:18:17] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: so for hinamatsuri??
[03:18:26] <Satin> s/recipie/recipe/
[03:18:37] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: no. Seijinshiki
[03:18:38] <MootPoot> Satin: get a used vaccum sealer for  cheap
[03:18:42] <mixfix41> i like the air fryer quick fries and leek cakes
[03:18:45] <MootPoot> it'll solve your meat and veg storage problems
[03:18:50] <ButterNoodle> ic
[03:18:53] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: it's a separate holiday
[03:18:58] <MootPoot> sausage and brussels spouts
[03:19:15] <ButterNoodle> I love learning new cute holidays for japan
[03:19:49] <ButterNoodle> *pee break and laundry
[03:19:51] <MootPoot> Satin: I buy like 5kg of salad and meat at a time and just vac seal it until I need it - shit works wonders
[03:19:52] <Satin> Fenderbassist: Yeah I feel alright on that front. It's just my bad sleep schedule that's harder to shake than I thought. Even on days when I go at a sane time to bed, I only sleep for 3 hours and automatically wake up with it being difficult to go back. Pair that with my friend who I talk to a lot who's currently stationed in the US airforce in Japan etc, and it's just a generally not good combination right now.
[03:19:59] <MootPoot> but you need the upfront cash to buy a lot when its on sale
[03:20:38] <Fenderbassist> Satin: I understand, perhaps you need to schedule a bit more downtime to slow the mind a bit, perhaps adjust that sleep habit
[03:20:43] <Satin> It's also leading to excuses for myself when it comes to studying. I don't really study much at all because I'm too tired after my fitness/chores stuff to do that so late in the day.
[03:20:48] <Fenderbassist> Satin: less PC time to stimulate the brain less
[03:20:56] <Satin>  yeah for sure
[03:21:15] <Satin> But I'm also aware I can't force good habits all at once.
[03:21:19] <Fenderbassist> indeed
[03:21:28] <Fenderbassist> life by the yard is hard, but life by the inch is a cinch
[03:21:41] <Fenderbassist> slow and steady wins the race
[03:21:46] <Satin> So I'm happy with *generally* sticking to the fitness/chores stuff which I haven't for the past year, and then gradually working my way towards doing even the studying consistently and reliably.

[03:22:07] <Fenderbassist> just like in the Highlander movie and the Karate Kid movie, must find balance
[03:22:33] <Fenderbassist> in all things, balance
[03:22:39] <MootPoot> I've found that you have brainpower for the first 2-4 hours after you wake up
[03:22:45] <Satin> School starts in 9 days
[03:22:50] <MootPoot> then you can do the autopilot stuff like exercise late
[03:22:53] <MootPoot> r
[03:23:15] <Satin> MootPoot: It doesn't feel like that for me, it feels like doing excercise really helps my rhythm going
[03:23:22] <Satin> but at the same time drains me as well lol.
[03:23:23] <Fenderbassist> you have plenty of time then to get yourself sorted out well
[03:23:33] <Satin> first thing*
[03:24:02] <Satin> MootPoot: I'm quite sensitive to disruptions in my schedule, on days where I'm doing one thing after another and not facing one huge unforseen event, I do relatively great at getting Things Done TM.
[03:24:19] <Satin> so starting out with fitness stuff really makes me feel motivated and focused tbh
[03:24:26] <Satin> ... just drained too
[03:24:33] <Fenderbassist> Satin: cardio first thing every day worked for Saitama :)
[03:24:35] <Satin> which ia ssume will go down with time
[03:24:38] <Satin> Fenderbassist: yeah
[03:24:45] <Satin> I might just walk first thing but yeah
[03:24:55] <Fenderbassist> a nice walk for now every morning is plenty of exercise
[03:25:01] <Fenderbassist> you can do it in 20-30 minutes
[03:25:06] <Satin> 'sactly
[03:25:06] <Fenderbassist> and then have the rest of the day for other things
[03:25:13] <Fenderbassist> I suggest this
[03:25:53] <Satin> I've been aiming for that 
[03:25:59] <Satin> did it like twice now :P
[03:26:05] <Fenderbassist> good, you will do it then
[03:26:14] <Fenderbassist> one thing down, the rest will fall in place
[03:26:25] <Fenderbassist> as long as you pace yourself and keep your nutrition and focus balanced
[03:26:31] <Fenderbassist> you're gonna do fine

[03:29:12] <Fenderbassist> good, keep that vitamin D level up, it reduces covid symptoms
[03:29:15] <Satin> I really need to slather on more sunscreen. My skincare routine needs it
[03:29:22] <Fenderbassist> yes that is a good idea
[03:29:40] <MootPoot> imagine having a skincare routine
[03:29:42] <MootPoot> cant relate
[03:29:49] <MootPoot> I just shower in crude oil every day
[03:29:56] <MootPoot> then maple syrup after
[03:30:19] <Fenderbassist> castille soap, loofah
[03:30:23] <Satin> I didn't for the past year or so after getting discharged but I was also working on re-discovering myself and what not, and it was hard to hold routines

[03:31:04] <Satin> smh
[03:32:08] <MootPoot> AAAAAAAAAA
[03:32:11] <Satin>  My version of "discovering myself" Pooters is different. It's like wondering why I got so lucky in such an incident as being shot 5 times, etc, and not really having the same mental framework of working on getting away from my parents etc. It was like my identity shifted.
[03:32:36] <Satin> But I've come to accept a large chunk of that. Stuff like Kokoro, that book you dislike, also help. Good literature is amazing :3
[03:32:49] <Satin> so did a lot of travelling, and friends, and independence

[03:33:47] <MootPoot> evolved from satin
[03:33:50] <Satin> I mean I say that and will stiill struggle with PTSD shit but that's just like it is
[03:34:24] <Satin> MootPoot: no, I had a pretty robust mindset about things last year. I even told my friend 4 days before the incident, and I was explaining why I didn't fear death. And I didn't in the moment.
[03:35:04] <Satin> it's just, imagine when you get half-disabled and what not. how do you now process what life is to you when you're not... perfect physically, etc etc. when you're delayed in school for an entire year and what not, you'll never be the same
[03:35:13] <Satin> Coming to terms with that isn't the easiest thing sometimes.

[03:40:04] <MootPoot> you just acclimate
[03:40:07] <MootPoot> or at least I do
[03:40:13] <MootPoot> so now I  have a broken sense of risk
[03:40:41] <Satin> I'm not afraid of risk directly, it's more that I had something effectively happen, disrupt things, and then had to cope with the aftermath of that yeah
[03:41:01] <Satin> lmao this guy that was aggressively coming at me a few days ago when i was talking a walk at dollar general waving his hands in the dark
[03:41:22] <MootPoot> It's not even coping but indifference,which might be a way of coping I guess

[03:46:03] <Fenderbassist> yeah sounds like a rough time
[03:46:04] <Satin> i wasn't
[03:46:11] <Satin> just what i thought to say at the time to the cam
[03:46:26] <Satin> it just hit me how severe that was, so it doesn't surprise me much now when my watch says my VO2 max is low as fuck
[03:46:35] <Satin> oxygen retention stuff
[03:47:19] <Satin> not a reason not to push/train my lungs as much as I can, but I def do have issues that won't go away ever and I have to work around

[03:49:48] <Satin> there's so many nice excercise you can do that burn calories
[03:49:52] <MootPoot> I already have my 25kg one 
[03:49:53] <Fenderbassist> I started with pushups, crunches, leg lifts, standing squats
[03:49:58] <MootPoot> But the problem is 
[03:50:03] <Satin> MootPoot: Yeah but that's just one single dumbbell.
[03:50:07] <MootPoot> It's fucking
[03:50:09] <MootPoot> Boring
[03:50:25] * MootPoot needs his dopamine cycle 
[03:50:48] <Satin> MootPoot: a) Get a fitness watch. A garmin, not a fitbit since google owns fitbit. It'll help with tracking and also motivation and is useful for a lot of things.
[03:50:55] <Satin> I have the Forerunner 245.
[03:51:28] <Satin> b) get more than one dumbbell and start doing excercises and have a certain reps/sets in mind. One isn't going to cut it. And that single one also sounds p heavy for you if you don't have prior muscle strength
[03:51:50] <Cryowolf> get one with one of those chest straps
[03:51:56] <Cryowolf> theyre better at detecting heartbeat
[03:52:04] <Satin> If you care *that* much
[03:52:06] <Satin> I doubt he does
[03:52:12] <Cryowolf> Yeh
[03:52:38] <Satin> My heartbeat tracker is usually enough for me not to go overboard when running, because as soon as I start jogging and what not, I hit 180 bpm pretty easy
[03:52:47] <Satin> I try not to go past that and let it go to 200
[03:52:49] <Cryowolf> also...completely ignore the caloric calculations since they are like 100x higher than they should be
[03:53:01] <Satin> Yeah for sure, though it's good as a veryyyyyyy rough estimate
[03:53:08] <Satin> but the calorie stuff is not accurate
[03:53:09] <Cryowolf> 200 and you'd have a heart attack
[03:53:18] <Satin> i've already hit 200 like twice before lol
[03:53:25] <Satin> not good, i know
[03:53:34] <Cryowolf> probably calculating it wrong then
[03:53:36] <Satin> body easily picks up heartrate here
[03:53:38] <Satin> nawh
[03:53:47] <Satin> hospital did tell me my heartbeat tends towards the higher side too
[03:53:58] *** Joins: Guest18 (~Guest18@219.88.233.181)
[03:54:00] <Satin> and reddit says max heartbeat being 200 isn't directly a cause for concern
[03:54:04] <Cryowolf> how old are you? cause at a certain point, your heartbeat doesnt have 200 in its range
[03:54:06] <Satin> but consistently it is obviously bad
[03:54:08] <Satin> 22
[03:55:14] <Cryowolf> the rule is usually 220 - your age, but it stops being useful late 20s
[03:55:25] <Cryowolf> so you should just about be within that margin
[03:55:30] <Cryowolf> of it being your absolute max
[03:55:52] <Satin> Yeah my watch says something like that as well
[03:56:04] <Satin> I don't let that happen anymore
[03:56:08] <Fenderbassist> you could stick to walking for a while
[03:56:15] <Satin> I'll just stop and slow down to a crawl when that happens
[03:56:21] <Fenderbassist> or that
[03:56:36] <Cryowolf> better to keep it steady around 150-160 during cardio
[03:56:43] <Satin> I try to do both. I get better mileage I've noticed by just walking a lot, and then having spurts of consistent running while glancing at my heartbeat 
[03:56:59] <Satin> Cryowolf: 170ish for me lol, it's very hard to keep it under 160
[03:57:00] <Satin> very hard

[07:19:49] <MootPoot> If only I had the $$$ for it, not gonna buy anything until next job
[07:20:00] <MootPoot> although I have figured out something
[07:20:13] <Roey> MootPoot: there's no RISC-V-based SBC that can bet turned into such a switch?
[07:20:31] <ButterNoodle> I was seeing my cisco shit the bed and was gonna just buy a better proc for the router.. but then realized for about 75$ more I could just get another 5008 and toss the cisco altogether
[07:20:33] <MootPoot> so none of my wifi clients are at the multiplexing level where they can take advantage of those 4x4 or 3x3 wifi APs
[07:20:45] <ButterNoodle> ic
[07:20:58] <MootPoot> so I'm just thinking about getting that hapAC3
[07:21:04] <ButterNoodle> so no noticeable increase on a 4x4
[07:21:16] <MootPoot> well, afaik the client needs to be 4x4 as well
[07:21:16] <Roey> ah
[07:21:20] <MootPoot> I think
[07:21:26] * Roey doesn't know more so will shut up
[07:21:42] <MootPoot> the other way it can help is if you have a LOT of clients so the 4x4 will send 4 streams at once
[07:21:46] <MootPoot> rather then 1 or 2
[07:21:47] <ButterNoodle> I would hope that a 2x2 or 1x1 or whatever would get shifted to less busy radios on a 4x4 setup
[07:22:00] <MootPoot> so it keeps better service accross multiple devices
[07:22:27] <ButterNoodle> idk how that congestion control works at the phy layer on the newer wireless.. I only made solutions when there was a single radio
[07:22:42] <MootPoot> right now I'm still debating what I should swap it to, but its either a TP link ax5400  for 170 or a hap ac3 for 150
[07:22:51] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: something called OFDMA I think
[07:22:52] <ButterNoodle> only makes sense if they load balance/share across radios
[07:23:08] <ButterNoodle> ahhh *multi access
[07:23:54] <ButterNoodle> yea I let the wireless architect deal w that shit at the last job.. wireless is as painful as telephony
[07:24:14] <ButterNoodle> people get real assed up when dey wifi's aint werkin in the shitter
[07:25:01] <MootPoot> that's my only hangup really
[07:25:23] <MootPoot> if mikrotik made a AP with MU-MIMO

[08:23:53] <MootPoot> I realized maybe the reason why my quest 2 dosen't work is because I have like 30 devices on the 5ghz band
[08:24:05] <MootPoot> so maybe swapping to tri band will fix it
[08:25:35] <davic> MootPoot: just put all non-essential ones on the 2GHz one
[08:25:49] <davic> and then just like phone, quest 2, beakys mom on 5GHz
[08:26:07] <MootPoot> even if I did that, that's still like 10 high use clients
[08:26:45] <MootPoot> I guess the other alternative (cheaper too) would be to just buy another AX router and only use the quest 2 on it
[08:27:04] <Satin> MootPoot: stop
[08:28:05] <MootPoot> no
[08:28:18] <MootPoot> actually
[08:28:27] <MootPoot> I have that shit router in the basement, I wonder what it is
[08:28:36] <MootPoot> wifi AC? I could just use that as the quest 2 only router
[08:36:25] <MootPoot> nvm google san says AC fucks up
[08:36:38] <MootPoot> too many close by wifi networks

[16:42:32] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: sometimes I feel like security questions would be easier for identity thieves than me
[16:42:38] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: they ask you random questions from your public information
[16:42:56] <TsundereNoises> what was the name of your first pet? what was I considering as MY first pet when I answered that the first time?

[16:46:07] <TsundereNoises> good, use a credit union ImoutoBot
[16:47:18] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: before I could restore that card. I would have taken the bottom of the muffin :)
[16:48:00] <TsundereNoises> I mean, I like muffin bottoms, but things were that bad?
[16:48:06] <TsundereNoises> did the 2nd beach trip really screw things up?
[16:48:30] <amigojapan> Yes the beach trip really left is broke
[16:48:43] <amigojapan> Us*
[16:50:30] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: things would not be bad if my aunt would not have stolen my inheritance too
[16:50:59] <TsundereNoises> so that got resolved in the worst way then?
[16:51:02] <TsundereNoises> no hope left?
[16:51:33] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: only hope for me is a pro bono lawyer
[16:51:55] <TsundereNoises> doesn't seem likely for that kind of thing does it?
[16:52:02] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: I have not taken her to court yet
[16:52:38] <TsundereNoises> on the other hand, maybe she wouldn't want to go to court and would settle if you actually had a lawyer in mexico
[16:52:56] <amigojapan> Yup
[16:54:45] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: are is occupying two properties now. Since the apparent was fixed from the earthquake
[16:54:55] <amigojapan> She is*
[16:55:12] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: look at it this way though, even if you never see any money at all from her, isn't it better to have moved to japan and lived the life you've lived, instead of living in mexico but definitely inheriting the building?
[16:55:46] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: I guess so
[16:56:40] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: it would bother me less if my subconscious did not keep on reminding me of it in my dreams
[16:57:02] <TsundereNoises> yeah, dreams are assholes
[16:57:20] <TsundereNoises> whenever I'm really stressed, I tend to dream about other really stressful things
[16:57:43] <amigojapan> Ouch, right
[17:00:11] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: pretty sure my public records know things I never heard of
[17:01:42] <TsundereNoises> like what kind of thing?
[17:02:08] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: like the address of my aunt from the US
[17:03:48] <TsundereNoises> they'd expect you to know that?
[17:04:03] <TsundereNoises> I probably don't know the address of most of my relatives, other than my parents/brother
[17:04:09] <amigojapan> Yes
[17:04:31] <TsundereNoises> I'd even get the town wrong on a bunch of them, because in my brain they live in rochester, but the house is technically in greece  (next town over)
[17:04:51] <TsundereNoises> I think, those relatives moved, maybe that isn't true anymore
[17:05:21] <TsundereNoises> I think the best I can do is like a 10 mile radius on all my relatives
[17:05:21] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: and the town I went to college in, they did not accept "west palm beach FL"
[17:05:40] <TsundereNoises> not even that for a couple cousins I haven't talked to in 20 years
[17:06:04] <amigojapan> I see
[17:06:06] <TsundereNoises> oh, was it in regular palm beach or something but you lived in west?
[17:06:10] <TsundereNoises> that's obnoxious
[17:06:37] <amigojapan> It's a town near palm beach
[17:07:00] <TsundereNoises> I feel like lots of real people don't know the address of plenty of their relatives, or whether something was in one town or the next one over

[18:13:38] <TsundereNoises> yes
[18:13:50] <Sadale> ButterNoodle, PM :3
[18:14:44] <flyke> I dont know why she is the most popular character from the anime(at least), in the manga she rarely(really) appears.
[18:15:02] <flyke> Like there is a gap of 80~ chapters between her last appearance
[18:15:24] <flyke> She is forgotten there
[18:15:42] <TsundereNoises> flyke: I mean partly because she's my favorite actor in the cast
[18:15:53] <TsundereNoises> and I don't think I'm alone in that
[18:16:09] <flyke> She probably gets more screentime on the anime 
[18:16:30] <TsundereNoises> that happens a lot in tv, when one character kind of takes off due to actor, they get more screentime
[18:16:30] <flyke> Also the anime is very early to the manga.
[18:16:31] <TsundereNoises> it's a cycle
[18:16:43] <flyke> yep
[18:17:06] <TsundereNoises> flyke: in the tv show justified, there was a character who was going to be killed off in like episode 2 originally who became a main character for the whole show because everyone liked the actor so much
[18:17:07] <flyke> I think she started to appear lest often on the late chapters
[18:18:04] <flyke> She is just for gag relief
[18:18:30] <flyke> She almost gets no development from the entire cast on the manga
[18:19:21] <TsundereNoises> Hayasaka is the other best girl
[18:20:40] <flyke> I kinda feel bad for her, she lived almost her entire life just as servant.
[18:21:14] <flyke> Got no time to enjoy her normal teenage life as kaguya
[18:21:50] <JesseDesu> they killed off asakura pretty early but she came back in the movie with long ass screen time
[18:21:52] <TsundereNoises> true, she's kind of tragic in a way, but she's interesting
[18:22:04] <JesseDesu> and that nagato yuki spinoff

[19:25:57] <Sadale> MootPoot, That's how you spend money. $50 for 4 pieces of lewd toys. :P
[19:26:05] <Satin> MootPoot: you can, but be fairer
[19:26:06] <Sadale> Instead of spending $2000 on a screen
[19:26:08] <Satin> smh

[19:26:26] <Satin> it's too easy to tear other people down when you don't knwo anything y know

[19:26:33] <TsundereNoises> do monitors count as sex toys?
[19:26:35] <Satin> too used to some communities like that on discord
[19:26:37] <MootPoot> she could have spent that money on some vibrators and a gaming PC

[19:28:27] <JesseDesu> satin is bullet proof
[19:28:37] <JesseDesu> nothing can kill her
[19:28:45] <Sadale> TsundereNoises, dafaq? The car owner get returned to Canada because of COVID-19 restriction?
[19:28:55] <Sadale> I don't think that's should be the reason of deporting him
[19:29:00] <JesseDesu> i'm gonna make that 3rd cup of coffee now
[19:29:02] <TsundereNoises> it doesn't matter if you're actually in education, employed or training, NEETdom is a lifestyle
[19:29:24] <TsundereNoises> Sadale: that's more why border security is amped up
[19:29:24] <mixfix41> you shouldnt have panic bottom line satin
[19:29:30] <TsundereNoises> Sadale: you'd get deported anyway
[19:29:41] <MootPoot> I spent 40 dollars on tupperware
[19:30:12] <TsundereNoises> Sadale: like that's the rules they used, but they try to enforce the border anyway
[19:30:18] <Satin> MootPoot: no
[19:30:19] <TsundereNoises> I think we should just secede and join Canada
[19:30:24] <TsundereNoises> gotta learn French though
[19:30:29] <Sxem> im a pyrex tupperware guy
[19:30:29] <TsundereNoises> or "french" rather
[19:30:36] <MootPoot> TsundereNoises: no, we have to outnumber them
[19:30:41] <Satin> mixfix41: i bought $150 of btc for the lulz
[19:30:46] <Sxem> pyrex is always the best
[19:30:47] <Satin> since i see it's at 41k now
[19:30:47] <MootPoot> imagine a entire country of french speakers
[19:30:50] * MootPoot shudders
[19:30:50] <Satin> it's meaningless
[19:30:52] <Sadale> TsundereNoises, I see.
[19:30:52] <MootPoot> france
[19:30:57] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: terrifying
[19:31:10] <Satin> but if i wake up tomorrow to it back at 44k or something y'know
[19:31:23] <mixfix41> they recommend setting up ubuntu but i think ubuntu is more for advance users that "know the ropes" you set up a wallet + node to learn it you learn it right
[19:31:31] <Satin> wait i'm having a math fail on how to actually calculate profit here
[19:31:47] <MootPoot> We'll set them up as the assigned rioters for anything we are angry about TsundereNoises but otherwise I think we should leave them contained
[19:32:01] <JesseDesu> i had this dream i was in a mega huge airliner that had a pool in it
[19:32:11] <MootPoot> JesseDesu: cum pool
[19:32:11] <JesseDesu> like a huge pool
[19:32:12] <Satin> find the diff, get the percentage of the change
[19:32:16] <Satin> then multiply $150 by it right
[19:32:31] <JesseDesu> MootPoot, whats a cum pool
[19:32:37] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: fine, but I can't very well suggest we secede to New Brunswick or Ontario or something, that'd make things even more confusing
[19:32:45] <JesseDesu> is that like a mix from 2 guys
[19:32:50] <Jigsy> LIBERATE MOOSEJAW!

[19:48:06] <Satin> mixfix41: Make a hard distinction in your mind between the technology involved, and the way it's being used as a speculative investment.
[19:48:37] <Satin> The technology and the financial side are two very different things. The former is used by the latter, exaggerated, lied even on, to pump the price, and so on.
[19:49:39] <Satin> You should also be aware that unlike other "infotech" solutions, we have not really seen "blockchain" technology, which is part of cryptocurrency, being used in a concept where you can say "this is foolproof, this is better with blockchain than some other solution" despite it being around for over a decade now.

[19:51:50] <Satin> That has *NOT* panned out.
[19:52:17] <Satin> Now it's treated like an investment. It's not actually being used at scale anywhere. And it's very arguable where the value is coming from there.
[19:52:20] <JesseDesu> nice kimono
[19:52:23] <Satin> Or if we even need it.
[19:52:53] <Satin> There are of course, things coming out from this that might have some solid concrete application and not just treated as speculative investments though that everyone is in on to get rich.
[19:53:24] <Satin> a) Other cryptocurrencies that do things better. Like Ada is one example of something that might succeed. Maybe Ethereum, past all the memes, might come up with something with their smart contracts system.
[19:53:43] <JesseDesu> ada is a military programming language

[19:55:38] <Satin> It's not that it's without potential. But you don't see even one concrete application of it. LOL
[19:55:55] <Satin> Besides of course, people using it to buy shady shit, understandably.
[19:56:15] <klaxa> it could be a superior store of value and medium of exchange than gold
[19:56:21] <Satin> Outside of cryptocurrency, there's so many "blockchain" companies. Even more opening up this year.
[19:56:27] <klaxa> it's easier and cheaper to store and transfer
[19:56:29] <Sapphirus> Satin, yeah, and all the regulations, requiring buyers to identify themselves in exchanges, has made it difficult to even use as anything other than just an investment vehicle.
[19:56:37] <JesseDesu> if you buy 50 shades of grey at a paint store does that make you shady
[19:56:38] <Satin> There's established blockchain-utilizing companies in the medical sector now.
[19:56:44] <Satin> Bank sector and so on.
[19:56:50] <Satin> Promising changes utilizing blockchain.
[19:56:53] <klaxa> that's all stupid though
[19:56:59] <Satin> Except. None of it is concrete. None of it is delievered on yet.
[19:57:06] <klaxa> these companies don't need a trustless environment
[19:57:07] <Satin> It's all promises. Potential.
[19:57:19] <klaxa> they just want funding
[19:57:22] <Satin> And it's not even known if they *really* need blockchain tech in the first place in that context.
[19:57:31] <klaxa> like i said
[19:57:32] <Satin> It's almost like a repeat of machine-learning "AI" snake oil.
[19:57:33] <klaxa> these companies don't need a trustless environment
[19:57:45] <mixfix41> except take blockchain. btc is the first and highly successful at this point so its more bowing down than saying 6k is too expensive.
[19:57:48] <Sapphirus> There's more of a hurdle to buy bitcoin than there is to just use fiat with a credit card. I'd say that's the #1 reason why it'll never take off as a currency.
[19:57:51] <Satin> Of companies that promise big things with AI, and then you actually dig in and find out AI is used very sparsely in a certain part of the process.
[19:57:56] <Satin> And the rest mostly done by human beings.
[19:58:01] <Satin> But the marketing says something else... heh.
[19:58:11] <Satin> https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~arvindn/talks/MIT-STS-AI-snakeoil.pdf
[19:58:12] <ImoutoBot> [application/pdf] 1.2MB
[19:58:17] <mixfix41> 6k was impressive it was matching the dollar in worth and projecting with 0 a/effect from inflation
[19:58:27] <mixfix41> 6-8 k range
[19:58:45] <JesseDesu> if i buy dice to intentionally make random decisions, is it still random
[19:58:47] <Satin> (Though to be fair, "AI" or machine learning algos are far more mature and actually delivering things more concretetly than anything "blockchain")
[19:59:26] <klaxa> blockchain is a misnomer anyway
[19:59:28] <Satin> klaxa: Sapphirus: I think the biggest lesson out all of this IMO is that, even things that are fundamentally flawed, or arguably huge ponzi schemes can "work" if people find a way to convince everyone to get in on it.
[19:59:34] <klaxa> it should be degenerated merkle-tree
[20:00:10] <Sapphirus> Satin, just like the FED in the United States. :P
[20:00:18] <Satin> oi :P
[20:00:22] <JesseDesu> algerian algorithms in algebra generate algae
[20:00:29] <klaxa> like i said, i do see the application of bitcoin in store of value and medium of exchange simply for economic advantages over gold
[20:00:47] <klaxa> and that's also what the pioneers envisioned
[20:01:04] <Satin> Likewise. But it's something to be expanded on, researched, and developed into concrete working products or services.
[20:01:12] <Sapphirus> Gold at least has physicality and intrinsic real-world value to it
[20:01:16] <klaxa> that it would be the gold of the cryptocurrency space to settle big exchanges between large "crypto-banks"
[20:01:17] <Satin> What's going on now is.... things being sold in the name of the potential.
[20:01:21] <JesseDesu> satin how do i make money with NFT art
[20:01:26] <TsundereNoises> Sapphirus: not much intrinsic value
[20:01:28] <JesseDesu> can you do it for me
[20:01:28] <Satin> JesseDesu: idk
[20:01:35] <JesseDesu> i'll give you a cut
[20:01:41] <klaxa> JesseDesu: my advice is: don't buy nfts
[20:01:41] <TsundereNoises> Sapphirus: in that it's not useful, it's just not super common
[20:01:43] <klaxa> only sell nfts
[20:01:48] <mixfix41> when you bring up other cryptocurrency if you look into it there has been another bitcoin implmentation which they all decide to reject and move on and its still implementing to this day like another cryptocurrency its all about paying close atteention
[20:01:54] <JesseDesu> how about 31%
[20:02:00] <JesseDesu> so i get t keep 69
[20:02:07] <TsundereNoises> if the demand for gold were only for industrial uses, it'd be much cheaper
[20:02:22] <Sapphirus> TsundereNoises, also in the labour required to find it, mine it and smelt it.
[20:02:29] <Satin> mixfix41: BCH?
[20:02:34] <TsundereNoises> Sapphirus: yes, but we use a hell of a lot more copper
[20:02:37] <JesseDesu> BITCH
[20:02:44] <Satin> I remember when that fork happened
[20:02:51] <TsundereNoises> gold isn't special except that we collectively choose to believe it is
[20:02:58] <Satin> Also reminder I had 100k dogecoin
[20:03:00] <JesseDesu> hey BCH

[20:03:21] <Satin> coz i had no money
[20:03:23] <Sapphirus> I don't think it's that simple.
[20:03:32] <Satin> and now dogecoin is closer to 1 doge = 1 USD
[20:03:33] <Satin> so
[20:03:37] <Satin> y'know
[20:03:41] <TsundereNoises> Sapphirus: why is gold in particular good as something to back a currency?
[20:03:48] <mixfix41> well i agree maybe the animosity towards the investment ill have to figure out how to deal with but its onnly been researching. i do not conjure up the negatives.
[20:04:00] <Sapphirus> In contrast to a fiat currency, or?
[20:04:06] <TsundereNoises> Sapphirus: compared to any other metal that you'd have to mine, if you think that matters
[20:04:12] <Satin> mixfix41: no no, none of what I'm saying means I'm suggesting against any of that

[20:04:42] <Satin> different things
[20:04:55] <mixfix41> on the contrary lets say lets focus on only btc. cause i admit theres thing im not saying that i believe i understand about it
[20:04:56] <Sapphirus> Rarity is probably near the top of the list.
[20:04:57] <Satin> man I wish we had another gamestop thing
[20:05:02] <TsundereNoises> Sapphirus: you were talking about intrinsic value (like compared to bitcoin or fiat currency) but most of gold's value is the same thing
[20:05:03] <Satin> and fucked over big corps again

[20:05:25] <TsundereNoises> gold isn't especially useful, plenty of things are rare
[20:05:33] <JesseDesu> ezekielnoob, my professional light setup is coming today
[20:05:35] <TsundereNoises> gold is special because it makes you feel like a pirate
[20:05:41] <Sapphirus> ...
[20:05:47] <TsundereNoises> that last part is a joke, mostly
[20:05:48] <Satin> LOOOOOOOL
[20:05:54] <TsundereNoises> but it's also my point
[20:05:55] <JesseDesu> gold tinted windows act as a faraday cage
[20:06:08] <JesseDesu> also, gold has higher heat conductivity than copper
[20:06:13] <Nanobot> City passes a law banning people from evading the robot police. Robot police: "Hey you--! Oh, you're fine now. You're under a--! No, you're good. Stop in the--! Have a nice day."
[20:06:18] <TsundereNoises> people have a weird hard-on for gold
[20:06:21] <JesseDesu> so you can fry an egg with a god pan
[20:06:24] <ezekielnoob> JesseDesu yo... goodluck!
[20:06:27] <Sapphirus> You really think fiat currency is about as valuable as gold when it can be printed via/through the central bank's ponzi?
[20:06:32] <JesseDesu> gold pan
[20:06:39] <JesseDesu> cant spell gold without god apparently
[20:06:44] <TsundereNoises> Sapphirus: I mean for one thing that's not what ponzi scheme means
[20:06:49] <mixfix41> fiat lacks a tender that bitcoin is
[20:07:00] <TsundereNoises> Sapphirus: and I'm arguing against your idea that the value is intrinsic
[20:07:02] <JesseDesu> fiat makes a 500cc car 
[20:07:06] <mixfix41> which in the explanation video is a dumb down synonym
[20:07:10] <MootPoot> Am I a boomer
[20:07:14] <TsundereNoises> value isn't just rarity, it's also demand
[20:07:17] <MootPoot> i dont like all these fancy JS websites
[20:07:22] <TsundereNoises> and that goes for gold as much as anything
[20:07:32] <Sapphirus> There is intrinsic value to gold and that's not just because "human believe."
[20:07:33] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: neither do I
[20:07:34] <JesseDesu> boomers are born roughly in the post war years up to 1960
[20:07:39] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: welcome to boomer club
[20:07:52] <Sapphirus> Because "human believe," is probably most applicable to fiat currency, given how it's backed by nothing.
[20:07:53] <TsundereNoises> Sapphirus: that's a big chunk of it though

[20:10:04] <TsundereNoises> JesseDesu: so are you arguing that the demand for gold is purely for practical/industrial uses?
[20:10:08] <Sapphirus> Said intrinsic value can be used to stabilise and cap a currency's value
[20:10:18] <Sapphirus> Fiat currency on the other hand could be printed until it's worthless.

[20:13:45] <JesseDesu> better to do the sculpture in clay, cast it in iron, plate it with gold

[20:15:58] <JesseDesu> TsundereNoises, if a woman stepped foot on mars what would she say
[20:16:05] <Satin> you encounter "she/he" and find it as passive aggressive bs?
[20:16:10] <mixfix41> also this dip is happening with the pandemic wave come to think about it
[20:16:23] <Satin> mixfix41: no, the dip is more tied with the fed minutes
[20:16:23] <TsundereNoises> Satin: when I see someone type "she/he" I automatically read it as them being passive-aggressively transphobic
[20:16:24] <mixfix41> the largest last dip was when china had put the ban on it altogether
[20:16:33] <Satin> mixfix41: because the fed is hiking rates
[20:16:39] <Satin> that they relaxed in order to combat covid partly
[20:16:43] <mixfix41> could be both
[20:16:50] <TsundereNoises> Satin: rather than they

[20:17:03] <mixfix41> the feds want to see it succeed that cant says its foreign enablers 
[20:17:10] <Satin> and obviously crypto is one of the big ones so it's getting hit hard
[20:17:30] <JesseDesu> the post master general reverses the order of he/she to she/he in his videos
[20:17:35] <Satin> TsundereNoises: I don't think that's a fair assumption to make - regarding the transphobia part
[20:17:37] <JesseDesu> i think he's just trying to be more inclusive

[20:57:02] <Satin> because it does affect the markets
[20:57:22] <Satin> it can be directly connected to that, the fed minutes were released, and immediatly the price started dropping
[20:57:44] <Satin> this is bceause investors had assumptions that the feds wouldn't hike rates so quickly
[20:57:51] <TsundereNoises> I don't know about this, but not all reactions to fed statements are rational either

[22:31:09] <Satin> yes
[22:31:38] <TsundereNoises> like you can have a character fit most criteria of a stereotype but still be good art
[22:31:52] <TsundereNoises> either because you comment on it OR because you just execute it extremely well
[22:31:54] <Satin> well yes also my original point was this before the short tangent into the definition of woke: I don't like media that is "diverse" or "queer" or "pushes boundaries" for the sake of just doing that
[22:32:20] <Satin> or like, basically pandering to the diversity audience, mix in some new details, voila, apparently this is a new consumable product with a few things shuffled around
[22:32:34] <Satin> I want organic originality? Idk how to phrase this
[22:32:38] <TsundereNoises> I'd argue there's some inherent good done by trying to make things more diverse even when it gets shoe-horn-y, although I don't think that's the ideal
[22:32:42] <emmeka> Satin forgive the breeders their awkward attempts at inclusion, they are trying
[22:33:11] <TsundereNoises> Satin: that all female ghostbusters movie was shit, but not because it had women in it
[22:33:15] <Satin> like having stories written by queer people that is organic and original, and where something like being queer isn't a main selling point or a shuffle around, but, something that.... is original you know
[22:33:23] <Satin> emmeka: lol
[22:33:25] <emmeka> really, you just sound like a hipster right now. or whatever passed for a hipster a decade ago
[22:33:29] <TsundereNoises> Satin: and She-ra is great, if that's what you're on about
[22:34:02] <TsundereNoises> Satin: I'm a bit concerned that your true, deep in your heart definition of what counts as forced vs commercial is just what you like/what ends up good
[22:34:12] <emmeka> searching for authenticity in media and consumption of media when there is none to be had and there never was
[22:34:15] <Satin> emmeka: idk, i don't care if I do either I guess, my position is obviously one of the culture industry in the big big picture, but in this context i'm juts talking about this
[22:34:24] <Satin> idc if i sound like a hipster*
[22:34:53] <TsundereNoises> Satin: also, you're veering into something that is one of MY problems with overly woke media actually
[22:35:01] <Satin> TsundereNoises: no, I'm mixing up things, but it's multifaceted
[22:35:08] <emmeka> but really I'd like an example of media that you think is queer only for the sake of tokenism

[22:39:53] <TsundereNoises> Satin: I worry that there's a subconscious element of that, I have always had a hard time defining what the difference is in some ways myself
[22:39:56] <Satin> so that would never be the case
[22:40:07] <Satin> TsundereNoises: Adorno was right.
[22:40:11] <Satin> The culture industry exists.
[22:40:12] <TsundereNoises> Satin: I knew you're wrong about aesthetics, yes
[22:40:43] <emmeka> to some degree I get what you're saying that sometimes the presence of queer characters can feel as if they are only there to check off of things you're supposed to include, but like, we're maybe a decade into the experiment of queer characters being allowed to exist
[22:40:57] <TsundereNoises> Satin: whenever I think of you, I picture you with a big portrait of Adorno on the wall above your bed with glitter and fake kiss-marks on it
[22:41:07] <emmeka> so I forgive a bit of shoehorning
[22:41:14] <JesseDesu> TsundereNoises, thats oddly specific
[22:41:31] <TsundereNoises> JesseDesu: specificity is the heart of comedy
[22:41:58] <Satin> I don't forgive shoehorning that much, like I don't raise a furor over it obviously, but it's just as cringe as all the other bad bits about popular media today
[22:42:01] <JesseDesu> can we all take a second to appreciate satin being alive
[22:42:06] <JesseDesu> this channel wouldnt be the same
[22:42:07] <Satin> JesseDesu: no
[22:42:11] <JesseDesu> ok fine
[22:42:15] <Satin> I would shill adorno from the grave /s

[22:42:28] <ImoutoBot> emmeka: (144 / 179) <e‚Äãmmeka> 20th century French philosophy is the leading cause of brain cell death, little known fact
[22:42:28] <Satin> yes
[22:42:34] <Satin> that's a famous pic
[22:42:40] <Satin> a discord emoji even
[22:42:42] <TsundereNoises> yes, that's the one
[22:42:50] <JesseDesu> who tf is adorno
[22:42:51] <Satin> postmodernism =/= crit theory
[22:42:54] <TsundereNoises> I should photoshop one
[22:42:54] <Satin> but i'm sure em realizes this
[22:42:56] <emmeka> I do appreciate Satin being alive
[22:43:00] <TsundereNoises> I do too!
[22:43:08] <TsundereNoises> I think I'm one of the top Satin-appreciators
[22:43:23] <TsundereNoises> I don't make fun of the people I dislike
[22:43:38] <TsundereNoises> when's the last time you saw me make fun of MootPoot?
[22:43:40] <Satin> thank you, thank you, I'd like to shill cheez its for these 5 seconds i'm in the spotlight
[22:43:49] <emmeka> I mean, Adorno wasn't French, but quote stands
[22:44:17] <Satin> it isn't about being french or not, he was part of the neo-marxist frankfurt school which was active around the time of WW2 :P
[22:44:25] <emmeka> JesseDesu one of the grandpappies of critical theory, along with all the other revisionist fucks
[22:44:26] <Satin> and out of which "critical theory" emerged 
[22:44:37] <Satin> postmodernism is..... different.
[22:44:44] <JesseDesu> revisision
[22:44:50] <Satin> I get that they can have similiar vibes sometimes, but it's not really that similiar
[22:44:52] <JesseDesu> revisionist fucks
[22:45:16] <Satin> all of philosophy is revisionist then /s
[22:45:17] <SummerSkies> I'm gonna go anime shopping soon
[22:45:17] <Satin> !!
[22:45:29] <TsundereNoises> anyway, I do actually think there are examples of pandering, but I think people accuse good things of pandering all the damn time
[22:45:31] <JesseDesu> every generation rebels from the previous
[22:45:33] <TsundereNoises> almost more than actual bad things
[22:45:38] <SummerSkies> something that motivates me to cover more ground in binge sessions is having better animes to look forward to in the future
[22:45:40] <TsundereNoises> because it's cooler to hate on things some people like
[22:45:55] <JesseDesu> gen Z invented words that piss off gen Y
[22:45:56] <emmeka> I mean they're basically the same but approach different issues and ran in different circles in different generations
[22:46:02] <Satin> they're not
[22:46:06] <Satin> disagreed there
[22:46:07] <emmeka> to the gulag with all of them anyway
[22:46:11] <Satin> no
[22:46:12] <SummerSkies> and ever since emmeka put my attention to the ufotable library I've been interested in the method of finding other shows from the studios that have made my already favorite animes

[22:47:42] <Satin> the frankfurt school is far more "traditional" in philosophy in many ways, almost all of them were well educated in philosophy and more and much of their complaints about things are very targeted and specific in many ways, idk how else to put it
[22:47:51] <emmeka> SummerSkies it's a reasonable approach for some studios, less for others
[22:47:53] <Satin> postmodernists are actually new, sometimes radically so
[22:47:55] <TsundereNoises> Satin: anyway, I have so many disagreements with all of this, firstly that things with commercial motives aren't ever good which seems to be a base assumption
[22:48:00] <JesseDesu> !seen fenderbassist
[22:48:00] <Bco1981> frankfurt is something you eat.
[22:48:00] <ImoutoBot> JesseDesu: fenderbassist was last seen in ##anime 17 hours and 2 minutes ago: <Fenderbassist> goodnight everyone, stay healthy and get your vitamin D
[22:48:06] <emmeka> Satin yes they ran in different circles in different generations.
[22:48:07] <TsundereNoises> which is funny, because you'd think the intent of the author is something you'd disregard...
[22:48:16] <Satin> it's not that they too weren't well educated and what not, but sometimes, some postmodernists, like focuault, do things very very differently
[22:48:20] <Satin> emmeka: wrong :P
[22:48:26] <emmeka> but they did.
[22:49:03] * MootPoot gives emmeka some coffee
[22:49:04] <Satin> I'm glad the postmodernists existed, they brought hard truths to light in this world, and the way we think is fundamentally around their shadow now
[22:49:12] <TsundereNoises> Focualt can be pretty high on my list for philosophers who've made the world a more annoying and possibly actually worse place
[22:49:12] <emmeka> >hard truths
[22:49:13] <Satin> does this have negative consequences too? absolutely. 
[22:49:18] * JesseDesu gives emmeka morphine
[22:49:21] <Satin> "hard to deal with truths"
[22:49:22] <Satin> XD
[22:49:24] <JesseDesu> its morphine time!
[22:49:25] <Satin> good catch
[22:49:29] <emmeka> I think postmodernists would object to the notion of anything they say being true
[22:49:33] <emmeka> or truth existing
[22:49:33] <Satin> nawh
[22:49:34] <Satin> not true
[22:49:36] * MootPoot gives emmeka salty coffee with chocholate in it
[22:49:42] <Satin> that's just a boogeyman created out of them
[22:49:59] <Satin> like every other stereotype there is SOME level of truth to it, but it's like you know, exaggerated to hell and god knows what
[22:50:01] * JesseDesu gives satin arbys gyro
[22:50:12] <Satin> none of what they actually say says there's no truth or whatever to the world
[22:50:25] <Satin> regardless of what anyone claims
[22:50:26] <TsundereNoises> I hate people tying Foucault particularly to the school-to-prison pipeline issue, because his comments are much broader and much worse overall
[22:50:39] <TsundereNoises> although we should also stop putting so many people in prison for sure
[22:50:42] <Satin> JesseDesu: i had the diablo dare
[22:50:44] <Satin> their new sandwich
[22:50:48] <Satin> today is day #1 of it
[22:50:49] <JesseDesu> was it hot
[22:50:58] <Satin> no, it was jalapeno spam
[22:51:05] <Satin> i regret even thinking it was going to be good
[22:51:10] <JesseDesu> sounds like some people would be into that
[22:51:12] <Satin> they give free milkshake with it claiming it's hot and you need it
[22:51:17] <JesseDesu> lol
[22:51:18] <Satin> i did need it, my mouth was a bit on fire and i was hiccuping
[22:51:19] <JesseDesu> good marketing
[22:51:23] <Satin> but it wasn't the good type of spice dude
[22:51:27] <JesseDesu> oh thats the worst
[22:51:33] <TsundereNoises> I mean, I do like milkshakes, but I'm not sure I like Arby's milkshakes
[22:51:33] <Satin> it's like the equiv of having raw chili or whatever
[22:51:35] <TsundereNoises> never had one
[22:51:39] <TsundereNoises> but I'm skeptical
[22:51:40] <Satin> TsundereNoises: pure. sugar.
[22:51:43] <Satin> processed.
[22:51:44] <emmeka> it's not though. look man, the shit rots your brain. you know how many good marx-reading socialists I've seen rot their brain in university on this crap until they start thinking things like "operationalizing text is fascism" and commit hardcore to idealism and rejection of the material
[22:51:44] <Satin> sugar.
[22:51:44] <TsundereNoises> ugh
[22:51:54] <emmeka> don't let them get you, Satin. your brain cells are precious.

[22:52:18] <ImoutoBot> TsundereNoises: Quote added for emmeka (180)
[22:52:31] <Satin> emmeka: and my honest pushback to that is you should read them yourself for before reaching such high/conclusive judgements. (I'm in the process of doing so, like with any other philosophical school of thought)
[22:52:36] <TsundereNoises> and I'll be the one to bring you to 360 too I hope
[22:52:43] <emmeka> I have, though
[22:52:46] <Satin> Yes there are issues with some of what they say, and yes there's a glaring hole in the world
[22:52:50] <JesseDesu> anderson cooper 360
[22:52:52] <emmeka> it was a dangerous endeavour
[22:52:57] <Satin> but it's not even close to what most people make out postmodernists out to be at all
[22:52:58] <emmeka> lost years off my life
[22:53:11] * TsundereNoises is too interested in specifics to deal with this generalized bullshit
[22:53:15] <Satin> there are good things very much from postmodernism
[22:53:16] <JesseDesu> i remember watching anderson cooper back in 2000 when he was on abc
[22:53:23] <Satin> to me
[22:53:25] <JesseDesu> he didnt come out then
[22:54:08] <JesseDesu> satin what about post hardcore emo
[22:54:15] <JesseDesu> IS IT GOOD 
[22:54:20] <Satin> to me it's natural that once modernism had run its course, something would have to probably arise and point out its limitations and what not, and so the post-structuralists/postmodernists emerged
[22:54:41] <MootPoot> my router is coming tommorow
[22:54:41] <emmeka> yes, throwing the baby out with the bathwater, the usual course of action
[22:54:43] <MootPoot> I cant wait
[22:54:43] <Satin> and we live in its wake, it's not something you rot your brain from, the entire world is under its shadow now
[22:54:56] <Satin> for good and bad
[22:55:00] <JesseDesu> my $900 airbrush setup is coming tomorrow or the day after
[22:55:03] <TsundereNoises> so postmodernism is Mordor
[22:55:04] <TsundereNoises> got it
[22:55:05] <Satin> and i'm glad it is, we can start working on fixing the bad now
[22:55:07] <MootPoot> emmeka: I ended up passing on the mikrotik - the routerOS is nice but the wifi isen't good enough
[22:55:10] <emmeka> why live in the material world or make it so words have meaning when you can say IDEOLOGY in a sexy enough voice
[22:55:18] <JesseDesu> is that the one butternoodle likes
[22:55:38] <Satin> The material is shaped by the conceptual
[22:55:42] <emmeka> false.

[22:56:22] * TsundereNoises plays language games
[22:56:25] <emmeka> Satin false. your concept of trees is shaped by the material entity trees, which we have a subjective reflection of
[22:56:28] <MootPoot> I'm GETTING MY KEYBOARD
[22:56:33] <emmeka> the world is material, deal with it
[22:56:43] <Satin> it's not entirely material by any means

[22:56:51] <JesseDesu> MootPoot, is it a Das
[22:56:58] <emmeka> or idk just roll back the clock to us fellating Hegel or something
[22:56:59] <Satin> that's reductive
[22:57:07] <JesseDesu> seductive
[22:57:24] <TsundereNoises> Hegel is kind of big, I'm not sure most of us can handle him
[22:57:31] <Bco1981> TsundereNoises: What are you making, kids?... What, are you making kids?
[22:57:32] <JesseDesu> big peen
[22:57:35] <Satin> the way people look, act, think, behave has power. power to oppress. power to suppress. power of possibilities

[22:57:48] <Satin> abstractions that shape our boundaries
[22:57:50] <emmeka> Satin I'd have this conversation more, but I have a feeling you haven't actually done any reading on materialism or have a rigorous idea of what I'm objecting to in the thinkers you're promoting, so I will wait

[23:06:31] <Satin> if you're rich
[23:06:34] <Satin> so who cares at this point lol
[23:06:45] <TsundereNoises> yes, but it disguises the cheating!
[23:06:50] <Satin> just bribe the proctor and use exemptions for disabled students XD
[23:07:00] <TsundereNoises> before, when W got into Yale you knew it was just because daddy paid up
[23:07:03] <emmeka> there's no standardized test for that here, you apply to college/universities based on your high school grades and extracurriculars. But we also don't really have the concept of "elite schools"
[23:07:05] <TsundereNoises> now you can claim it was objective

[23:07:53] <JesseDesu> in elementary they make you take tests with those scantron bubbles
[23:08:05] <JesseDesu> and that determines if your school gets funding
[23:08:14] <Satin> i hang around discord study group servers with students from a bunch of bigger universities and stuff in the mix
[23:08:18] <JesseDesu> and also boosts the attractiveness of home buyers in the area
[23:08:22] <Satin> it's accepted and unquestioned
[23:08:30] <Satin> that if your parents r rich that's how you got in
[23:08:40] <Satin> i think i know some dude in the CS program at the university of waterloo or smth too?
[23:08:48] <Satin> just how it is

[23:09:48] <Satin> emmeka: are you sure about that
[23:09:49] <emmeka> yeah but they're not prestigious
[23:10:01] <TsundereNoises> although usually I'm coming at that more from: "why does my alma mater need to have 11 vice presidents with the salaries they get"
[23:10:11] <TsundereNoises> and yet shitty student housing and increasing tuition
[23:10:13] <MootPoot> TsundereNoises: because money
[23:10:14] <emmeka> Satin private universities are nominally legal here and technically exist in some provinces, however, none of them would be considered prestigous
[23:10:22] <emmeka> almost all of them are just religious institutions
[23:10:24] <MootPoot> n00b tier universities
[23:10:28] <Satin> fascinating
[23:10:37] <MootPoot> look at the weird american looking on at us
[23:10:41] <emmeka> the best universities here, like say Queens, are all public
[23:10:57] <Satin> MootPoot: my stare burns a hole through people
[23:11:00] <MootPoot> well, I'd amend that a bit emmeka 
[23:11:12] <MootPoot> "any university worth a shit" is public
[23:11:27] <TsundereNoises> yes yes, I already talked about seceding to canada once today but I don't think you'd really want this town
[23:11:31] <Satin> what are the ramifications of being public in this context
[23:11:37] <emmeka> I mean some of the weird Christian ones are actually fine universities, but they're not more expensive or more elite
[23:11:46] <Satin> does that mean they operate in the best interest of society over there or
[23:11:47] <emmeka> there's that one in Ottawa
[23:11:53] <Satin> well not like that but
[23:11:55] <Satin> i meant to say
[23:12:17] <Satin> does that mean they're more insulted from idk for profit scandals
[23:12:29] <emmeka> oh nvm apparently it isn't even private, lol
[23:12:39] <emmeka> it just has a weird agreement with both the Catholic church and U of Ottawa

[23:13:00] <emmeka> I knew someone who went there
[23:13:20] <emmeka> Satin universities can't be for profit here.
[23:13:21] <Satin> flashback to my french 101 prof saying universite 
[23:13:35] <Satin> emmeka: how common is it for american students to hop over there
[23:13:41] <emmeka> common
[23:13:43] <Satin> is it expensive
[23:13:48] <Satin> tutition costs and all
[23:13:51] <emmeka> compared to some US tuition? no
[23:14:00] <Satin> mmmm
[23:14:02] <emmeka> but compared to like a public US tuition in your state? yes
[23:14:06] <Satin> oh 
[23:14:10] <Satin> yeah
[23:14:29] <Satin> also the school i go to lmao, the public tutition is cheap relative to the payoff
[23:14:46] <Satin> so an exceptional situation so i can't properly compare
[23:15:08] <emmeka> Satin being public means they're accountable to and funded by the government, though, self-governing in their own right. They are not-for-profit and subject to certain limits.

[23:15:55] <Satin> interesting
[23:16:03] <TsundereNoises> also a lot of "public" schools here are much more profitable
[23:16:10] <Satin> TsundereNoises: very true
[23:16:13] <TsundereNoises> see my earlier comment RE: vice presidents
[23:16:14] <emmeka> Satin and fwiw, college and university do not mean the same thing here. You have to decide which of the two you want to go into starting in the 10th grade.
[23:16:34] <TsundereNoises> a lot of public schools cost a lot and the administration sucks money out of them like they're bain capital
[23:16:45] <Satin> emmeka: right, mine is a college unlike the nearby University of New Mexico because it's not a collection of colleges i guess
[23:16:49] <Satin> but
[23:16:56] <Satin> we use it to refer to both here
[23:17:00] <emmeka> no, "college" here does not mean what "college" means in the US
[23:17:03] <Satin> i can say i go to a uni and not feel weird about it
[23:17:09] <Satin> what does it mean
[23:17:22] <MootPoot> the numbers, what do they mean?

[23:18:00] <emmeka> a college here is a vocational school that offers diplomas 2-3 years in length that are for specific trades or industries. You can't transfer between the college and university system, in most cases.
[23:18:10] <emmeka> a university offers bachelor's degrees and so on so forth
[23:18:14] <Satin> oh nice
[23:18:16] <mixfix41> satin you put your head back in crypto a dollar is just skin
[23:18:18] <Satin> we need that here
[23:18:31] <emmeka> well it has its own problems
[23:18:49] <TsundereNoises> I'm not a fan of making kids commit to life long career decisions at 14
[23:18:58] <emmeka> basically the school system sorts everyone into one of the two paths starting in the 10th grade, and it is very hard to switch later.
[23:19:07] <Satin> yeah a lot of countries do that shit
[23:19:10] <Satin> france, even india
[23:19:15] <MootPoot> my uni does offer both, fortunately

[23:19:41] <Satin> I'm partly inside of the education system in the first place despite my parents fucking up homeschooling thanks to the US system's flexbility
[23:19:57] <emmeka> this usually has the effect of working class kids ending up on the college track even if they could probably actually hack university

[23:20:12] <Satin> i see
[23:20:30] <Satin> we do need more robust trade schools or something like that here
[23:20:34] <emmeka> or, vice versa, stupid rich kids going to the university track because mom and dad told them to
[23:20:37] <Satin> reskilling
[23:20:46] <Satin> without all the added fluff of university education and costs
[23:20:50] <TsundereNoises> yeah, there was just a big fight at the local school about the administration wanting to force a kid into a particular path because they had a "vision" for his future, over the objections of the kid and his parent
[23:21:07] <Satin> TsundereNoises: that sounds very... unique a situation
[23:21:15] <Satin> was this kid gifted or something
[23:21:17] <TsundereNoises> Satin: it is very depressingly not unique
[23:21:19] <TsundereNoises> no
[23:21:26] <Satin> wtf's going on there
[23:21:33] <emmeka> Satin also it's sort of unfair, because someone in the university track can easily drop down and go to college, but you can't do the opposite
[23:21:37] <TsundereNoises> but poor, single mom, he shouldn't take the hard classes because he's a troublemaker
[23:21:42] <Satin> emmeka: yeah i see
[23:22:06] <Satin> TsundereNoises: that sounds overreaching lol
[23:22:11] <TsundereNoises> it's very common
[23:22:14] <Satin> usually schools in the US strike me as being on the safe side
[23:22:26] <Satin> and parents are usually the very demanding ones
[23:22:36] <Satin> school boards and all of that
[23:22:48] <Satin> in other countries it feels like the parents have to make do with the school/government more like
[23:23:13] <Satin> being on the safe side as in, they have to play and pander to the best of their abilities and manage limited budgets or else
[23:23:21] <TsundereNoises> sounds like tv
[23:23:36] <TsundereNoises> school pander to parents only in the worst ways
[23:23:36] <Satin> and the pandemic
[23:23:42] <Satin> and crit race theory stuff
[23:23:43] <TsundereNoises> like parents complaining math class gives too much homework
[23:23:44] <Satin> just 
[23:23:46] <Satin> accelerated that
[23:23:46] <emmeka> Satin we also don't have this whole idea of like "going to a good high school"
[23:23:55] <emmeka> like, everyone goes to public school. that's it.
[23:24:04] <TsundereNoises> but weirdly have a spine about the wrong things, usually with kids that someone in the school kind of has it out for because they've been labeled a troublemaker
[23:24:06] <Satin> emmeka: yeah that's one of the sucky things about the US
[23:24:06] <emmeka> private schools nominally exist but are only for the most extremely rich
[23:24:11] <Satin> TsundereNoises: rofl
[23:24:16] <Satin> contridictions everywhere
[23:24:18] <MootPoot> I hear all they do there is have sex parties
[23:24:32] <TsundereNoises> Satin: also I'm not convinced anyone who ever talks about "critical race theory" ever has a fucking clue what they're on about
[23:24:44] <Satin> TsundereNoises: same, but I think we already are on the same page as this
[23:24:45] <TsundereNoises> but it's getting to feel scopes-trial-esque
[23:24:55] <Satin> scopes-trial?
[23:25:04] <TsundereNoises> really?
[23:25:13] <TsundereNoises> I forget you don't know shit about history sometimes
[23:25:15] <emmeka> MootPoot I actually spent a lot of time at one because one of my best friends in high school was the daughter of the dorm mother at this really old private boarding school that's in the city I grew up near
[23:25:17] <TsundereNoises> in retrospect it makes sense
[23:25:24] <TsundereNoises> Satin: court case about evolution being taught in schools
[23:25:31] <emmeka> all these big money Toronto kids, exiled to the boonies
[23:25:34] <TsundereNoises> Satin: science teacher was fired for teaching evolution
[23:25:36] <TsundereNoises> way back
[23:25:47] <Satin> oh
[23:25:52] <Satin> nah i remember that
[23:25:53] <emmeka> we taught them how to get into trouble and buy drugs and shit
[23:25:55] <MootPoot> is this like big money as in their parents made 6 figures
[23:25:59] <emmeka> teaching them the local culture
[23:26:00] <Satin> almost no one references it though
[23:26:04] <emmeka> as one does
[23:26:06] <MootPoot> or big money like multi millionares
[23:26:08] <mixfix41> ina bop
[23:26:09] <Satin> so ofc i didn't have it like, on hand
[23:26:11] <emmeka> also they were easy to rip off

[23:27:01] <TsundereNoises> Satin: sorry to briefly assume your parents actually managed to shield you from something
[23:27:13] <emmeka> really, people who make 6 figures still send their kids to public school here
[23:27:19] <ButterNoodle> a cup of coffee and a newport always made me shit rite quick
[23:27:27] <Satin> TsundereNoises: why does it feel like the scopes trial though
[23:27:45] <Satin> to me the crit race theory stuff is a garble
[23:27:46] <TsundereNoises> Satin: because we're more and more getting parents riled up about teachers "teaching critical race theory"
[23:27:57] <TsundereNoises> that's what's happening, more than any actually being taught
[23:28:13] <Satin> i see what you mean
[23:28:28] <Satin> yeah it's happening in states where there's no such concept even
[23:28:30] <Satin> lol
