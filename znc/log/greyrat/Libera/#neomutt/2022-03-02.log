[12:31:30] <gahr> sure

[12:32:25] <gour> "mu find" is similar to 'notmuch search', they both use xapian 
[12:32:43] <gahr> but that's statically "computed" when neomutt reads your config file

[14:59:27] <gahr> hi flatcap 
[14:59:55] *** Joins: weirdsmiley (~weirdsmil@203.122.10.222)
[15:00:29] <flatcap> hi gahr 
[15:07:36] <flatcap> it's still a WIP, but this is what a simple dialog looks like, post-menu_loop()
[15:07:38] <flatcap> https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/blob/flatcap/menu/alias/dlgalias.c#L333-L357
[15:08:40] <flatcap> the Menu is (very nearly) an independent graphical object
[15:16:22] <gahr> what's QWQ?
[15:17:15] <gahr> you just throw away the result of menu_tagging?
[15:17:40] <flatcap> oh, that's just a marker to remind me to look there before merging (QWQ is easy to type and unique over the codebase)
[15:17:52] <gahr> how smart is that!
[15:17:54] <gahr> :)
[15:18:08] <flatcap> :-)
[15:18:30] <flatcap> yes, the retval _might_ get used, things are still changing
[15:18:52] <gahr> what's a menu, again?
[15:19:15] <gahr> if (rc == IR_CONTINUE) break?
[15:19:15] <flatcap> `struct Menu` is a selectable list of items
[15:19:43] <gahr> ok so the alias dialog will have a list of functions
[15:19:47] <gahr> and the menu will have its own
[15:19:50] <flatcap> most of the tagging code doesn't affect the caller, just the internal state of the Menu
[15:19:57] <gahr> working on the selected item(s) or something?
[15:20:01] <flatcap> yes
[15:20:25] <gahr> it's just an alias dialog thing that they're separated?
[15:20:37] <gahr> I mean, a dialog could implement both the dialog and its menu's functions?
[15:20:38] <flatcap> IR_CONTINUE is separate because it _did_ behave differently, briefly.  it will probably be dropped
[15:21:08] <flatcap> yes, the obvious case for overriding is OP_SEARCH
[15:21:47] <flatcap> in menu_loop(), there was a while(true) which meant that OP_SEARCH had to have some extra magic to allow it to be overriddent
[15:22:36] <flatcap> technically, menu_tagging() should be called at the *end* of the caller's loop (in all code paths)
[15:23:16] <flatcap> it needs to be called unconditionally, so that it can turn of the "tag-" message on non-tagging opcodes
[15:23:54] <flatcap> so it's simpler to put it at the top
[15:24:34] <flatcap> and remarkably, the code still works :-)
[15:24:39] <gahr> :)
[15:26:02] <flatcap> (on one dialog, that is :-)
[15:27:09] <flatcap> that's in [flatcap/menu], still lots to do
[15:28:42] <flatcap> next I've got to carefully test the tagging ops, like OP_TAG_PREFIX_COND (remember what _that_ does? :-)

[16:03:29] <dcpurton> I've never really bothered to read up on the spec for all these icon locations
[16:05:33] <flatcap> nor I
[16:06:53] <flatcap> oh, the apps have their own dirs too

[16:10:52] <dcpurton> I think those ar efor internal application icons?
[16:11:57] <flatcap> ah, yes!
[16:13:35] <dcpurton> somewhere neomutt is finding an icon in my awesome menu
[16:13:53] <flatcap> :-)
[16:14:17] <dcpurton> not that I've ever started it by clicking on thatâ€¦
[16:16:16] <flatcap> can you have a look at the ranger .deb to find its install script
[16:16:39] <flatcap> see if there's anything we have to do after installing icons, e.g. update some cache
[16:16:52] *** Quits: bitigchi (~bitigchi@user/bitigchi) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[16:18:26] <dcpurton> Ah - there is a /usr/share/pixmaps/neomutt.xpm in Debian
[16:18:59] <flatcap> oh.  we should take a copy of that and install it ourselves
[16:19:53] <flatcap> ALL: Any BSD users listening?  Where are your desktop icons installed?
[16:21:28] *** Joins: weirdsmiley (~weirdsmil@203.122.10.222)
[16:22:24] <dcpurton> the xpm is 32x32, but different to neomutt-32.png
[16:23:30] <flatcap> I see other pngs in that dir, so our png might be ok -- I wonder who we ask
[16:25:05] <dcpurton> xpm has no alpha, so of course different
[16:25:49] <dcpurton> I have a feeling /usr/shre/pixmaps/ is deprecated
[16:26:21] <flatcap> oh ok
[16:26:29] <dcpurton> and the applications with png files in there are not ones you want to copy
[16:27:04] <dcpurton> zoom, skype, teams, discord, steam, chromium
[16:27:22] <dcpurton> there's a certain theme to many of them :)
[16:30:00] <gahr> flatcap: someone(tm) someday(tm) needs to add proper scripting support to neomutt.. tag-prefix-cond is the evidence :D
[16:30:29] <flatcap> hehe
[16:30:51] <flatcap> dcpurton: yeah, all the apps that don't follow the rules
[16:31:48] <flatcap> gahr: Kevin wrote and merged a simple Lisp interpreter.  would you like to add _that_? ;-)
[16:33:27] <gahr> like in the meme, every sufficiently complex program embeds a lisp interpreter?
[16:33:46] <gahr> honestly, I'd love to have that. I like lisps
[16:35:26] <flatcap> oh, ok :-)
[16:42:17] <flatcap> #3279 summarises the problems
[16:42:17] <neo-bot> ðŸ”§ discussion by @flatcap "Breaking `menu_loop()`s Hold on NeoMutt" with 0 comments: https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/discussions/3279
[16:50:58] <gahr> sounds reasonable
[16:51:18] <gahr> I don't get the part where the generic functions don't need menu data to work
[16:51:27] <gahr> how does search work without a list of entries to search?
[16:51:52] <flatcap> global functions
[16:52:13] <flatcap> most of the generic functions are menu functions
[16:52:31] <flatcap> but the global functions don't need any Menu data
[16:53:03] <gahr> ah, yup, I mixed global and generic
[16:53:17] <flatcap> I've just bolded it for clarity
[16:53:48] <gahr> I took them as synonyms :)
[16:54:10] <flatcap> ah :-)
[16:54:11] <gahr> of course I should have the legend at hand
