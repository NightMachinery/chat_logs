[00:12:09] <patanga>  Patsie: awk scripts with >100 LOC should be considered big. awkie awkie, the wiki engine, xml gawk are just two very big projects
[00:15:38] <patanga> earnest: who author of awk? Aho teaches at Columbia now, Peter Weinberger works with Google after having worked for a hedge fund, and Kernighan teaches Javascript at Princeton
[00:15:53] <earnest> kernighan
[00:16:02] <patanga> earnest: oh, how do you know?
[00:16:09] <earnest> He said so
[00:16:14] <patanga> where and when?
[00:16:18] <earnest> youtube
[00:16:30] <patanga> oh, cool, i will go into that
[00:16:52] <patanga> any title of the video, conference name or something?
[00:16:59] <earnest> You'll have to search a bit, there's a lot now.  I don't specifics anymore
[00:17:18] <patanga> ok. interesting enough to spend some time!
[00:17:57] <patanga> i thought that the performance comparisons between awk and perl (80ies?) involved some complex scripts.
[00:18:17] <patanga> and they were very well known.
[00:20:28] <patanga> e36freak: interesting idea to put one column into an array, having calculated the mean of that array, calculate standard deviation etc of that array in the END
[00:22:40] <patanga> earnest: the question of not abusing tools, using the right tools etc is indeed very interesting. Honestly one can question where people like Kernighan have finished. His book "D for Digital" does not really read like the work of a Guru. Maybe he is just old. Maybe he has lost something. Who knows?
[00:23:04] <earnest> He never claimed anything
[00:23:23] <earnest> Look into AMPL
[00:24:26] <patanga> what do you want to say with AMPL? That he was a guru in the 80ies?
[00:29:44] <patanga> earnest: or do you want to imply that awk is intended for one-liners otherwise Kernighan would not have developed AMPL for more complex stuff?
[00:30:31] <earnest> No it's just something else which he did that is math focused, closed source.  Nice syntax though

[00:30:42] <earnest> I don't know why you want him to be some "guru" or something
[00:31:01] <earnest> And I don't really want to continue this weird discussion either
[00:34:09] <patanga> well, you could have just not spoken anymore. similar to the motto "dont ask to ask, just ask" : "dont say to quit a conversation, just quit it".
