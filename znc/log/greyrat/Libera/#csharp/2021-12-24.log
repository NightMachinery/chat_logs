[04:24:00] <bpmedley_> I see

[07:00:30] <bomb> you're overthinking it Ameisen

[07:33:07] <ern> ok
[07:34:53] <bomb> heh
[07:35:10] <ern> The idea in this video Tesla refused to even touch the car (replace battery) since it was privately imported from USA
[07:35:24] <ern> So even if he WANTED to pay the 25k usd dollar, he could not.
[07:35:33] <ern> Basically, the car was a paper weight.
[07:35:41] <ern> fun times
[07:36:28] <Suchiman> sonny: in .NET (Core) they wanted to have more freedom doing potentially compat breaking changes whereas doing any change on .NET Framework became a high risk adventure due to very obscure ways it could break compat (people have been relied on stack tracing in the past to determine the transaction level nesting depth in EntityFramework and MS had to roll back changes to private methods because that changed the stack traces)
[07:37:18] <Suchiman> sonny: so by default they do not allow major version roll forward as to avoid breaking apps in unexpected ways, leaving it up to the developer to either accept the risk explicitly, test using the new version themself or insist that the customer installs the older version side by side as well
[07:38:43] <sonny> yeah, that makes sense. I was thinking for the uwp templates they could use `latestMajor`
[07:43:09] <Suchiman> sonny: if they do that, they have the same issue as with .NET Framework again, anything they might change in a newer version will be immediately used upon installation by older apps and might cause breakage and nothing is more unpopular than an update breaking stuff

[07:48:20] <ern> Be whatever you want to be.
[07:48:35] <ern> But you have to face the consequenses
[07:49:02] <bomb> I just want to get rid of melancholy strikes
[07:49:21] <ern> Why do you have melancholy?
[07:49:30] <bomb> no reason
[07:50:03] <ern> You are your own golden standard, society is telling you you must have newest car, travel-a-lot, have huge salary and 12 inch of ... pizza on friday night
[07:51:05] <ern> I see lots of people who feel bad because they try to live up to the "society standard" which is basically impossibru without lending money from bank and working like a slave.
[07:51:33] <ern> I rake in "adequate" money, and I can't really even afford a car
[07:51:48] <ern> I walk everywhere. It keeps me fit.
[07:52:03] <sonny> your single?
[07:52:06] <ern> Yes.
[07:52:17] <sonny> ok, was trying to figure out groceries
[07:52:40] <bomb> ern society can suck my ugly duckling :\
[07:52:40] <ern> I buy best bang for the bucks, which is not possibly the most expensive, but the healthy stuff.
[07:53:08] <bomb> I should try walking, it help with the mood, I guess.
[07:53:57] <brianonymous> hey, how the fuck do i call typescript compiled shit on the client side
[07:54:11] <ern> I guess I spend about 50USD dollars/month in groceries
[07:54:16] <brianonymous> just look at the compiled js and figure it out?
[07:54:39] <ern> and additional usd 20 for "take out"
[07:56:30] <sonny> rather cheap
[07:56:40] <sonny> then again maybe not
[07:56:55] <sonny> think between my brother and I it used to be 100 a month for groceries
[07:57:32] <ern> This is Russia.
[07:57:56] <ern> But buying food for single person is kind of most expensive, the more people the bigger the boxes the less price per person
[07:58:11] <ern> Surely, I could cook+freeze, but it kind of makes no sense for cents
[07:58:22] <sonny> freezing food is gross lol
[07:58:37] <ern> No, it's not. It's perfect with the right foods.
[07:59:04] <ern> Which reminds me I have caviar in the freezer
[07:59:04] <sonny> eh, I eat simple stuff anyways
[07:59:33] <sonny> fancy
[08:00:57] <ern> I dont want to go to office
[08:00:58] <ern> argh

[09:06:12] <Ameisen> Suchiman - I've tried to be as thorough as I can in regards to readonly methods/properties and properly using 'in', at least
[09:06:47] <Ameisen> Their documentation does say that they flag using 'in' on non-readonly structs _because_ it can cause unexpected copies
[09:07:08] <Ameisen> but yeah, if these objects were being constantly copied... this would be very slow.
