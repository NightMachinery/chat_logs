[18:23:19] <bleb> yt-dlp is able to download this https://www.heinetwork.tv/episode/mass-no-time-to-die/
[18:23:26] <bleb> but the rest of the episodes are behind a paywall
[18:24:30] <bleb> the first episode is an embedded vimeo video which doesn't work if its not embedded: https://player.vimeo.com/video/624102342
[18:25:37] <bleb> assuming I pay for an account and log in, would there be any way to download the paywalled videos with yt-dlp?
[18:26:26] <bleb> like would I have to pass it my login credentials or cookies some how?
[18:30:57] <bleb> i can download the non-paywalled video with yt-dlp --referer 'https://www.heinetwork.tv/episode/mass-no-time-to-die/' 'https://player.vimeo.com/video/624102342'
[18:31:37] <bleb> so maybe the vimeo url + the referrer url would be enough and I don't need to provide login credentials
[18:32:03] <gnoo> bleb: if the paywalled content is provided the same way non-paywalled ones are, then i'd guess they can be downloaded
[18:32:08] <bleb> maybe someone can confirm this if they've dealt with a paywalled series hosted on vimeo?
[18:32:14] <gnoo> there's --username, --password, --video-password, --ap-username
[18:32:41] <gnoo> also --cookies, --cookies-from-browser
[18:33:57] <gnoo> if it uses vimeo password, it can be download               --video-password PASSWORD        Video password (vimeo, youku)
[18:34:06] <bleb> thanks, sounds like it should work one way or another
[18:35:11] <gnoo> it may or not work, i think the generic extractor is being used for that site. if it uses some other mechanism that the generic extractor can't use, you can't download
