[04:13:02] <KombuchaKip> Hello everyone. I've just submitted a PR request that modifies the README.md to include instructions for using my new unstable and stable PPAs: https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/pull/2154
[04:22:40] <JackFrost> 1. '“yt-dlp Team” team'?  2. It doesn't have any code or uploads.  3. s/Debian based/Ubuntu based/
[04:25:45] <tar_xvf> i'm not on the administrative team of yt-dlp, or at least those who have write access to the repo, but the official readme should probably only have officially-sanctioned means of downloading
[04:25:53] <tar_xvf> especially when it's already easy to download the binary for windows and unix
[04:32:57] <tar_xvf> on that note, i just read through the readme and it says on homebrew you install yt-dlp/taps/yt-dlp. Is it not possible to download just via `brew install yt-dlp`?
[04:33:29] <tar_xvf> https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/yt-dlp#default
[04:38:13] <KombuchaKip> JackFrost: Yes, it has code. Packages are building now.
[04:38:39] <KombuchaKip> JackFrost: Ubuntu is Debian based. APT is a creature of Debian.
[04:39:28] <JackFrost> I'm well aware, but Launchpad builds for Ubuntu releases, and in later ones you specifically *can't even install* Ubuntu built packages on Debian.
[04:40:25] <KombuchaKip> JackFrost: It doesn't build for specific releases, as in they aren't locked to that release. They're locked to dependencies. And yes, people install Ubuntu packages on other Debian based distros all the time. See the DPM for more information on how packaging is done.
[04:40:40] <KombuchaKip> JackFrost: https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/
[04:41:26] <JackFrost> KombuchaKip: I mean, I know packaging.  I'm an Ubuntu MOTU and Debian developer, I'm telling you in newer Ubuntu releases it doesn't work since they're compressed with zstd, and dpkg in Debian doesn't support that.
[04:42:29] <JackFrost> https://packages.qa.debian.org/d/debootstrap/news/20210426T141857Z.html debootstrap falls back to using 'ar' directly to create newer Ubuntu releases. :P
[04:45:20] <JackFrost> Huh, https://code.launchpad.net/~yt-dlp/+recipe/yt-dlp-stable is an interesting way to do it.
[04:46:17] <JackFrost> Also I don't remember in LP if you can, but you might want to change the defualt of https://code.launchpad.net/~yt-dlp to git.
[05:41:30] <KombuchaKip> JackFrost: If you want, I can add you as an admin to the Launchpad team. Paul (pabs3) and another Debian developer are already.

[07:24:26] <JackFrost> Sounds like you're in great hands, KombuchaKip.
[07:25:09] <KombuchaKip> JackFrost: Thank you sir. Just trying to help more people put to work this great CLI.

[12:14:57] <ede>  Your system's package manager will now automatically download the correct dependencies and keep the package updated with the rest of your system. # https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/pull/2154/commits/929e130d29bd96d32fd54030a1f5b0b2011ccc16#diff-b335630551682c19a781afebcf4d07bf978fb1f8ac04c6bf87428ed5106870f5R199
[12:15:57] <ede> i remember when ytdl introduced f-strings. debian( oldstable at least)'s python3 didn't support them, so building it from upstream was necessary.
[12:16:35] <ede> now what if there's another similar change and the installed distro python is considered too old?
