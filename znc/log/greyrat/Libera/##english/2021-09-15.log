[00:02:06] <TechTest> in the UK do you call the piece of furniture you have next to the bed a 'night stand' or a 'night table'?
[00:04:07] <anikolov> Isn't a 'night stand' when someone is standing up all night?
[00:04:44] <anikolov> I'm not from the UK so can't directly answer you thought.
[00:04:59] <anikolov> *though
[00:07:53] <anikolov> Yeah I verified is more of like 'one night stand' - what I'm thinking.

[12:45:58] <DevAntoine> Hello, I've bought a new watch and I've got an issue with it so I need to reach the seller to the customer service but I got a lack of vocabulary for it.
[12:46:16] <DevAntoine> Basically each time I set the time it got delayed by 10 minutes.
[12:47:04] <DevAntoine> I'm not sure what to say:
[12:47:23] <blkshp> Good Morning. I have recently purchased xxxxx watch from you and it appears to be faulty. Each time i set the time, it sets itself back 10 minutes. Please could you advise on a refund or replacement. Regards.. xxxxx
[12:47:58] <DevAntoine> Oh, thank you.
[12:48:10] <DevAntoine> So, "The watch got a 10 minutes delay" isn't correct?

[13:42:07] <blkshp> and no it isn't. The wrist is part of the arm. 
[13:42:14] <blkshp> The hand is also part of the arm
[13:42:19] <TechTest> I was never able to actually wear one for long times
[13:42:24] <blkshp> But, there's no 'arm in it 
[13:42:24] <TechTest> and the hand is part of the arm
[13:43:10] <blkshp> My front door is part of the house, the windows are part of the house, it doesn't mean the windows are part of the door.
[13:43:25] <TechTest> now I have gotten one of those smart bands that count steps etc
[13:43:35] <TechTest> it's very thin, but I still find it annoying 
[13:43:51] <TechTest> damn you blkshp 
[13:43:58] <TechTest> ok, you are right
[13:44:19] <blkshp> Thank you :D
[13:44:35] <blkshp> I have worn a watch on my wrist night and day for 30 years or so.
[13:44:40] <TechTest> *right by exception 
[13:44:49] <blkshp> I notice it, but, like wearing clothes, it doesn't bother me
[13:44:55] <TechTest> do you sleep with the watch? o.o
[13:45:03] <blkshp> Yes
[13:45:11] <TechTest> ok, that's weird
[13:45:23] <blkshp> Not really. Most smart devices do sleep tracking.
[13:45:43] <TechTest> and most of them fail to do so
[13:46:01] <blkshp> This one does it well because it knows me, i have been wearing it for 4 years now.
[13:46:07] <TechTest> both mines do, I'm not sure if it's worth investing on a more expenmsive one
[13:46:21] <TechTest> especially since I won't be wearing it...
[13:46:32] <TechTest> blkshp: which one is it?
[13:47:23] <blkshp> Mine's a Galaxy Gear S2
[13:48:00] <TechTest> oh that's an actual watch
[13:48:07] <blkshp> It's a smart watch
[13:48:22] <TechTest> I got a smart band because they are thinner and hopefully more confortable
[13:48:33] <TechTest> I mean an actual watch in terms of size
[13:48:48] <blkshp> tracks all my exercise, heart rate, sleep, and it's about the same size and about 1.5 times the weight of my old analogue watch
[13:49:25] <pussipupu> Four years between charges is pretty impressive
[13:49:29] * pussipupu ducks
[13:49:33] <blkshp> lol :D
[13:49:54] <blkshp> It's charged daily, sometimes more than daily.
[13:50:39] <TechTest> it is a high end watch 
[13:50:48] <TechTest> mine was like 35 bucks
[13:51:04] <blkshp> Yeah, this was £280 when i bought it.
[13:51:13] <blkshp> I've bought cars for less in the past lol
[13:51:14] <TechTest> it doesn't properly track sleep and also does a weird calorie tracking that I think is off
[13:51:21] <TechTest> cars?
[13:51:31] <blkshp> You know what a car is, right?
[13:51:55] <TechTest> a car that's less than £280... a toy car?
[13:52:11] <blkshp> No, a real car with wheels and an engine and stuff.
[13:52:30] <TechTest> lol where do they sell these cars?
[13:52:37] <blkshp> Scrap yards.
[13:52:37] <TechTest> I guess I could get a few
[13:52:51] <TechTest> £280 seriously?
[13:53:00] <blkshp> It was £250 i believe
[13:53:05] <TechTest> a working car?
[13:53:08] <blkshp> This was about 15 years ago
[13:53:13] <blkshp> maybe 12
[13:53:15] <blkshp> yes
[13:53:20] <TechTest> or did you have to spend another 2000 to fix it?
[13:53:59] <blkshp> No, when the head gasket went, i sold it back to the scrapyard i bought it from, they fixed it and i bought it back again 2 weeks later.
[13:54:19] <TechTest> lol
[13:54:35] <TechTest> ok, it seems like I should visit the UK to buy a car
[13:54:40] <blkshp> You could get some really cheap shit here when MOTs (The annual safety test) wasn't all electronic and infalible)
[13:55:46] <TechTest> I actually don't have a  driving licence 
[13:56:04] <TechTest> but the licence probably costs more than the car itself ::P
[13:56:15] <blkshp> I've been driving since 2003, i have had 14 cars, only 3 in the last 10 years so the other 11 were the 7 years before that when i didn't have money to spend on cars and no ability to get credit. You got what you could.
[13:56:31] <blkshp> You don't have to pay for licences here just the test to get one!
[13:56:47] <TechTest> really?
[13:56:55] <TechTest> the licence here costs 1200 euros
[13:57:38] <blkshp> If i remember the licence is free. You apply for a provisional then when you have passed your test you hand just get sent the proper one.
[13:57:58] <TechTest> maybe I should also get my licence from the UK too :P
[13:58:25] <blkshp> It takes about 20 hours of lessons and a theory, hazard perception and practical test (which is 1 hour of driving with an examiner(
[13:58:43] <TechTest> only problem would be that the driver's seat would be located in the wrong side of the car
[13:58:45] <blkshp> We have a very strict test process for drivers
[13:59:18] <TechTest> we do have that too, but it costs 1200 eur
[13:59:56] <blkshp> I have no idea how much the tests are these days.
[13:59:59] <TechTest> I don't really need a car where I live and it would probably not be worth getting one since I would have to pay taxes and fees
[14:01:04] <TechTest> maybe I'll get a motorbike if I ever need a vehicle since I already have a licence for that and I can get away with traffic and parking easily 
[14:01:25] <TechTest> traffic and finding a parking space is hell here
[14:02:25] <blkshp> I love driving in london for the hellish and dangersous traffic condfitionsl lol
[14:02:41] <TechTest> are you in London?
[14:02:45] <blkshp> No
[14:03:10] <pussipupu> I might have to drive in England over Christmas
[14:03:11] <TechTest> why would you go there then?
[14:03:19] <pussipupu> Not something I'm looking forward to
[14:04:02] <TechTest> if I was in Finland I wouldn't look forward to visit England either 
[14:04:10] <blkshp> Why it's great fun!
[14:04:20] <TechTest> I have been looking into erasmus programs in Finland 
[14:04:23] <blkshp> s/hy/hy?
[14:04:23] <chat> blkshp meant to say: Why? it's great fun!
[14:04:43] <pussipupu> Because English drivers be crazy
[14:05:05] <TechTest> s/drivers/sheep
[14:05:06] <chat> TechTest thinks pussipupu meant to say: Because English sheep be crazy
[14:05:09] <blkshp> English drivers are, for the most part, the safer of the worlds drivers
[14:05:25] <blkshp> We're good at what we do ;) You have to learn to be better at driving xD!
[14:05:34] <TechTest> English drivers drive at the wrong side of the car
[14:05:50] <pussipupu> I've only really got significant experience with English and Finnish drivers, and I know which I'd rather share a road with
[14:05:51] * blkshp chooses to ignore that.
[14:06:11] <pussipupu> *on the wrong side
[14:06:20] <blkshp> Ok, I have never driven with the Finnish
[14:06:21] <TechTest> thank you
[14:06:40] <TechTest> don't drive with the Greek
[14:06:54] <pussipupu> Some nutters of course, hence the rally success
[14:06:59] <TechTest> at least not before you learn the greek driving etiquette 
[14:07:13] <blkshp> What, just point and go?
[14:07:21] <pussipupu> I've only walked and sailed in Greece
[14:07:47] <TechTest> blkshp: no, there's a special language and gestures you need to know
[14:08:01] <blkshp> is one of them an extended middle finger, that's one we have here.
[14:08:06] <TechTest> but if you look like an English person you are screwed :P
[14:08:22] <TechTest> blkshp: nah, it's another one

[22:17:40] <TimMc> bin: "sociopath"? Hmm... what's a better option there?
[22:18:02] <lall-> just add few more syllables to it and it will be ok.
[22:18:22] <bin> TimMc: really there's no need for any word like that here
[22:18:27] <TimMc> sociopathicaleros
[22:18:33] <bin> nobody here is behaving in a socipathic manner
[22:18:44] <huf> add an "o not a s" after the s
[22:19:11] <huf> or perhaps an "upremely unlikely to be a s"
[22:19:25] <TimMc> bin: In case it wasn't clear, that was a joke about use vs. mention. "I don't have a problem with manslaughter" vs. "I don't hav ea problem with the word 'manslaughter'"
[22:19:32] <TimMc> *have a
[22:20:31] <lall-> people seem to be fogetting context.
[22:20:37] <lall-> like it doesn't matter
[22:21:22] <bin> TimMc: in case it wasn't clear, using terminology like that in a joking manner is inappropriate.
[22:21:31] <lall-> bin is missing it :)
[22:21:49] <bin> lall-: i'm afraid you're missing the point entirely
[22:21:56] <bin> unsurprising, very on-brand for ypou
[22:22:13] <TimMc> I can't tell if bin is missing the joke or misunderstood my request for an alternative.
[22:22:19] <TimMc> one or the other, I'm pretty sure?
[22:22:22] <lall-> it's just repressed rage buddy.
[22:22:25] <bin> just like saying "Stop being so OCD" is unacceptable
[22:22:39] <bin> TimMc: there is no joke. 
[22:22:42] <lall-> it's same kind of people that ban comedians because they say innapropriate things.
[22:22:54] <lall-> completely oblivious to context.
[22:23:17] <bin> Of course you make that obviously false equivalency and fail to see it as a false equivalency lmao
[22:23:25] <TimMc> bin: Well, you understood the intended meaning in my statement, even though you thought the word choice was poor, correct? So what's a better way to express the intended meaning?
[22:23:35] <TimMc> I'm honestly and openly asking for a better alternative.
[22:23:51] <TimMc> because you're probably right, but I need an alternative
[22:24:34] <TimMc> I can do my own research, but I was hoping you had a suggestion off the top of your head.
[22:24:52] <bin> TimMc: how about none? just "*I* care about manslaughter, don't know about you jokers"
[22:25:12] <lall-> bin: Nah bud. I don't see words as threat. I see people that use words in malicious manner as threat. That's called context, and you seem to rather bury your head in the sand and yell "blablabla" to yourself.
[22:25:23] <bin> oh, just ONE  more away from lall- bingo!!
[22:25:29] <lall-> lol
[22:25:55] <lall-> talk about uptight.
[22:27:03] <bin> I don't think you know what that word means lol
[22:27:15] <TimMc> bin: Right, that would work, except it's not really what I was trying to say... I wanted something to refer to like... "a person without a moral code and who is liable to use violence casually and without remorse".
[22:27:28] <TimMc> I feel like there has to be an actually correct word for that.
[22:28:02] <TimMc> Dunno, I'll do my own searches.
[22:28:07] <bin> how about maniac
[22:28:25] <lall-> So Maniac is fine, sociopath is not fine?
[22:28:30] <lall-> Brilliant reasoning right there.
[22:28:44] <bin> maniac isn't used in any legitimate psychological diagnosis
[22:28:48] <bin> sociopath is
[22:28:54] *** Quits: MysteriousSilver (silver@user/mysterioussilver) (Quit: fades into darkness)
[22:29:27] <lall-> and on irc, that matters how? I'm just trying to figure out your reasoning here.
[22:29:38] <bin> it matters in general. words matter.
[22:29:47] <jessicara> sociopath is?
[22:29:52] <TimMc> "Maniac", hmm.
[22:30:00] <lall-> no they don't. intent does. 
[22:30:01] <TimMc> That's an interesting point about diagnoses.
[22:30:06] <bin> jessicara: yes, people diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder
[22:30:22] <jessicara> is confusing being told they are different things, then now this
[22:30:22] <TimMc> But then "crazy" also isn't a diagnosis, and people don't like that being used casually either. vOv
[22:30:32] <bin> TimMc: yes, it;s why saying "lol I'm so OCD" if you're not actually is an issue

[22:30:51] <TimMc> also, OCPD would be more correct in that case :-P
[22:30:58] <lall-> TimMc, If i call you crazy mofo... and we're friends since birth, you are not gonna get angry at me.
[22:30:59] <bin> jessicara: who told you that sociopathy was different from antisocial personality disorder?
[22:31:15] <jessicara> psychopathy maybe actually instead
[22:31:22] <lall-> Or if i called you a mofo, and we grew up together. If some dude in a bar said that, I'm sure you would be pissed.
[22:31:37] <TimMc> Anything that uses "crazy" to imply "dangerous" is going to be problematic.
[22:31:47] * jessicara doesn't remember who unfortunately
[22:31:56] <bin> jessicara: ah yeah psychopathy is neuropsychiatric
[22:32:10] <lall-> people unfortunately give too much power to words, instead of intent
[22:32:41] <bin> TimMc: funnily enough I don't have so much of an issue with crazy as I do with misusing actual diagnostic terms so maybe that's hypocritical
[22:33:07] <lall-> nowdays you have hordes of people trying to ban certain words, or force people to utter certain words
[22:33:13] <bin> actually jessicara i get them mixed up sometimes too tbh because the info is constantly emerging with new info
[22:33:16] <jessicara> i don't get it, neuropschiatric is different?
[22:33:20] <bin> there are psychopathy personality traits
[22:33:29] *** Joins: MysteriousSilver (silver@user/mysterioussilver)
[22:33:44] <jessicara> neuropsychiatric, i think i mean to type
[22:33:49] <bin> so like when i was in school the big thing was sociopathy was formed due to trauma but psychopathy was more biological BUT I think that's changing these days
[22:33:57] <bin> I should refresh tbh
[22:34:45] <TimMc> bin: Dunno, not everyone has to find the same things problematic. :-)
[22:35:08] <jessicara> i thought antisocial personality disorder was more a way to try to come up with a useful criteria
[22:35:17] <jessicara> than specifically different
[22:35:30] <bin> jessicara: not sure what you mean
[22:35:32] <bin> TimMc: true :)
[22:35:36] <TimMc> I've heard about 5 different claims about the difference between "sociopathy" and "psychopathy" and I'm pretty sure trying to use either in a precise way is useless at this point, and maybe always was.
[22:35:54] <bin> very likely tbh
[22:36:17] <TimMc> I do share your concern with stigma around mental illness, which is why I was looking for alternative phrasing.
[22:36:39] <jessicara> i mean in diagnostic manual, a way to have a useful distinction for personality type and issues to expect
[22:36:53] <jessicara> rather than nebulous psychopathy/sociopathy
[22:37:02] <bin> I appreciate it tbh, apologies for the lag in response my L3 and Charter are fighting again
[22:37:12] <TimMc> eesh, good luck
[22:37:50] <TimMc> jessicara: For all the criticisms levied against the DSM, some rigor really does seem called-for.
[22:37:56] <jessicara> yeah
[22:38:01] <bin> jessicara: oh yes antisocial personality disorder is the diagnosis
[22:38:05] <bin> this is a good article https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.avb.2013.07.001
[22:38:42] <jessicara> my connection seems particularly awful too
[22:38:49] <jessicara> will take a few minutes to load
[22:39:14] <bin> no worries
[22:39:21] <bin> sci-hub is often a bit slow to fetch
[22:39:23] <jessicara> if it does load
[22:39:29] <bin> it will, it just takes a minute
[22:41:19] <bin> but yeah it's constantly emerging
[22:41:20] <jessicara> timed out
[22:41:28] <bin> funny enough i dont have an issue with just "psycho" being used
[22:41:31] <bin> why? idk
[22:41:34] <bin> i should think about that
[22:41:38] <jessicara> well
[22:41:43] <bin> jessicara: hm odd that it timed out
[22:41:46] <jessicara> it's also useful socially for people to avoid
[22:41:46] <jessicara> lol
[22:41:51] <jessicara> "psycho"
[22:42:01] <bin> i can upload the pdf if you want it
[22:42:13] <jessicara> maybe another time
[22:42:16] <bin> no prob
[22:42:26] <jessicara> yeah the packet loss is back too i think
[22:42:29] <TimMc> Interestingly, "creep" is OK and *doesn't* have a mental illness association.
[22:42:30] <bin> so yeah TimMc i actually feel liek "psycho" would be an okay term here
[22:42:48] <bin> i think socipoath and psychopath rub me the wrong way because theyre clinical
[22:42:56] <TimMc> mmhm
[22:43:03] <bin> but no clinician is like "well keith, you're a maniac and a psycho so yeah"
[22:43:26] <bin> well no competent clinician
[22:43:30] <bin> im sure someone somewhere -.-
[22:43:58] <jessicara> doctors still using the word hysterical it seems
[22:44:36] <bin> colloquially though
[22:45:16] <bin> not clinically, i don't think?
