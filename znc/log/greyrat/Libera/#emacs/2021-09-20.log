[20:23:24] <ec> How do I promote an output buffer to a window?
[20:23:31] <bpalmer> acdw: the book is pretty different in the same basic setting.
[20:24:13] <bpalmer> ec: a buffer is a datastructure that contains text (and images, etc); a window is a rectangular area that displays one. If you can see text, it's in a window.
[20:24:51] <bpalmer> ec: a rectangular area that contains windows and also has a title bar, minimize/maximize buttons, etc is a "frame"; do you want to display the buffer in a separate frame?

[22:15:21] <qhong> yes you can pretty much replicate the experience in REPL using scratch
[22:15:38] <qhong> sly REPL has back reference though, which is a killer feature not easy to replicate

[22:20:16] <akater[m]> Rogach: I dislike scratch buffer because results in scratch buffer are very eagerly abbreviated as “...”, because * doesn't work, because I have to type a newline by my own, because I have to press a lot of buttons to actually evaluate.
[22:20:16] <akater[m]> I actually prefer evaluating in org-mode.  But that still can get troublesome because print-object is ignored by org-mode evaluator, and emacs developers considered this a non-bug.
[22:20:28] <acdw> i mapped eval-defun to C-c C-c, game changer

[22:21:20] <Rogach> bpalmer: Thanks!
[22:21:27] <rpav> if you're seeing ... it's probably print-length getting set to non-nil
[22:21:34] <rpav> err yeah that
[22:21:39] <qhong> akater[m]: C-j is basically new line, and set your print-level and print-length

[23:36:02] <Bayes> org-mode is there a way to export all my org files more like in a wiki way instead of just ... one large html dump?
[23:36:09] <zaeph> It's Jethro's, my co-maint for org-roam; but mine is based off doomemacs's too.
[23:36:31] <bpalmer> Bayes: er.. isn't a wiki just a large html dump?
[23:36:48] <Bayes> maybe, yeah
[23:37:00] <Bayes> but like organized in different documents
[23:37:10] <zaeph> I shall return to my slumber, but feel free to ping me if you've got related questions.
[23:37:18] <Bayes> thanks zaeph btw
[23:37:22] <zaeph> Any time!
[23:37:32] <Bayes> org-roam seems a kind of wiki thingie, that's how I ended up on that repo
[23:38:05] <zaeph> It's related, yes.
[23:38:16] <Rogach> Is there a way to set lexical-binding to nil (or t) temporarily inside a function? (I want this to add a test for the lexical-binding related failure)

[23:42:22] <bpalmer> e.g., something like (let (f (make-temp-file)) (unwind-protect (progn (find-file f) (insert "-*- lexical-binding: t -*-") (save-buffer) (load f) ...) (delete-file f))) 
[23:42:48] <Rogach> bremner: Yes, that might work, but feels extremely overkill for a simple test.
[23:42:50] <bpalmer> (and clearly include some more (insert ...) to have the function definition you want to test.

[23:43:49] <bremner> I just think you should run away from this code
[23:44:05] <Rogach> Sorry, yes, I meant bpalmer.
[23:44:24] <Rogach> bremner: It's typescript-mode, not exactly the worst thing =)
[23:44:39] <Rogach> And I've already submitted a PR to start fixing things.
[23:45:28] <bpalmer> anti-dynamic scopism bums me out
[23:45:45] <bpalmer> there's nothing "more correct" about lexical scoping.
[23:45:49] <bremner> bpalmer: sorry, professional hazard :P.
[23:46:07] <bremner> well, there kinda is, but it doesn't matter here. But the original code was using eval.
[23:46:28] <bremner> ,NEWLISP
[23:46:29] <bpalmer> Oh, I thought that was just an example.

[23:47:49] <Bayes> bpalmer so apparently there's an ox-mediawiki that exports org-mode to mediawiki
[23:47:53] <bremner> and of course, some things are excusable in tests because there's no other way
[23:48:00] <Bayes> so that's one way I guess
[23:48:04] <Rogach> Actually, what's so bad about using eval? We're using Lisp here, eval is kind of at the very heart of it.

[23:48:56] <bremner> basically the same thing that is not-ideal about dynamic-scope-by-default
[23:49:09] <Rogach> But what if you created a piece of code to be evaled right before the eval? That's local enough, no?
[23:49:14] <bpalmer> think globally!

[23:50:12] <ecraven> (defun foo (form) (do some fun stuff (eval form)))  how is the user of foo supposed to understand what happens inside it and influences the environment where FORM is finally evaluated?
