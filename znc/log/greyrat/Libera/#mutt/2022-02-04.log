[01:25:42] <rwp> IIRC headers by standard *must* be shorter than 988 characters _should_ be shorter than 78.  I know... SPAM.  It's why we can't have nice things.
[01:27:06] <cmeerw[m]> I believe each line must not be longer than 998 characters, but a header can be split over multiple lines
[01:27:42] <cmeerw[m]> It looks like in this case the last continuation line didn't have a leading space (and was therefore seen as the start of the message body by mutt)
[01:31:48] <rwp> Sometimes when there is a corrupted Maildir message I am able to simply delete the message and sync the mailbox and it is gone.
[01:32:19] <rwp> Usually for me that is a 0 sized file because of some error.  It confuses things.  But I can delete it, sync, and then things are okay.
[01:46:46] <cmeerw[m]> By "completely confused" I actually meant that mutt only shows some gibberish instead of the actual message body.
[01:47:18] <cmeerw[m]> I have let the mail hoster know that they are generating corrupted mail headers

[18:20:12] <Samsonite[m]> how I can specify which mailbox to actually use in this scenario
[18:20:24] <Samsonite[m]> The macro is the one from the arch wiki:... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/74fdf959cf371f9ba54a37f06e61d3b23b5c5eb3)

[18:23:05] <Samsonite[m]> any advice here would be great. i can basically on use that macro for now when I want to see the thread. when i want to reply i need to use my "F4" macro that brings me to the correct mailbox and reply from there

[20:05:22] <ifohancroft> In $index_format if I set the maximum space for a string (let's say the subject) to 103 characters and the minum to 64 is there a way to cut the string at 64 characters? I.e. I want the subject to take 103 characters width regardless if there are more or less characters in it, however, I don't want to see actually more than 64 characters from the subject even if there are more? After the 64th
[20:05:24] <ifohancroft> character I want to just see 39 spaces
[20:06:14] <ifohancroft> That's with a left justified string (in-case it matters)
[20:08:14] <ifohancroft> Nevermind. I'm an idiot. I was setting my string to %-64.103 where I should have been setting it to %-103.64
[20:09:21] <ifohancroft> Now is there a way to make that fill with spaces not hard? I.e. so when I resize the window, the spaces get eaten away like they do when I use %* before a right justified string?
[20:09:57] <ifohancroft> Before the last column I meant to say not before a right justified string
[20:27:53] <ifohancroft> I'm sorry, I can't explain for shit. Here's what I'm actually trying to achieve:
[20:28:16] <ifohancroft> This is what I currently have in my config regarding index_format: https://pastebin.com/UvqbSEQX
[20:30:13] <ifohancroft> I want the subject and the correspondent columns each fixed at 64 characters, but I want the spaces between them to be more than one. Ideally, I'd like to be able to control how many spaces between them are. Then, when I start shrinking my terminal, currently, my date column starts moving to the left instead of getting hidden. It eats away the spaces to its left. I wanted the same to happen when the
[20:30:15] <ifohancroft> date column reaches the correspondent column. I want the correspondent column to not get hidden but start eating the spaces to its left (between subject and correspondent)
[20:31:11] <ifohancroft> The date spaces thing is achieved by putting %* before the date. I have tried doing the same before the correspondent column but that makes it show all the way to the left, with everything before it hidden
