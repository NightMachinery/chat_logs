[08:50:29] <MohdAariz[m]> Looph0le[m]: probably in the dev version
[08:50:44] <Looph0le[m]> yeah sussy microsoft
[08:50:44] <MohdAariz[m]> this was when windows 11 wasn't released and got leaked
[08:51:20] <Looph0le[m]> ahh they played with us coz of the ui glore
[08:51:36] <MohdAariz[m]> microsoft shoves the new ui into every user
[08:52:07] <MohdAariz[m]> its weird cuz windowstard's won't switch to linux cuz of the gui and shit(but you have a choice that works on every distro)
[08:52:16] <MohdAariz[m]> while microsoft just drops a new gui in every new release
[08:52:49] <MohdAariz[m]> also a funny thing you can't change the audio device in win11 cuz u need a license
[08:52:54] <MohdAariz[m]> thats like so retarded üíÄ
[08:53:15] <MohdAariz[m]> Ok how to get that res tho
[08:53:29] <Looph0le[m]> thats the thing i feel lucky coz i went to linux side
[08:53:51] <Looph0le[m]> MohdAariz[m]: if i can ask the reason
[08:54:01] <Looph0le[m]> you got a 1980x1080
[08:54:05] <Looph0le[m]> what the deal with that
[08:54:18] <MohdAariz[m]> i feel like 1366x768 is like the quality of almost 1080p without the performance loss
[08:54:36] <Looph0le[m]> no no dude
[08:54:53] <Looph0le[m]> it might less the resoultion
[08:54:53] <MohdAariz[m]> well i want it mostly for minecraft
[08:55:01] <MohdAariz[m]> Looph0le[m]: i want it as an option
[08:55:10] <Looph0le[m]> i see
[08:55:41] <Looph0le[m]> so does it mess the windows res when you full screen or something
[08:56:02] <MohdAariz[m]> what does/
[08:56:30] <Looph0le[m]> the current resoultion

[12:13:21] <NeoVoid[m]> * seeing the popularity of foss fishing users to use falsly conveyed opensource product in the glorifying lable of open source is not uncommon practice these days. as we know he himself doesnt seem to take free software philosophy seriously and trying to use closed and open source methodology hybridly.
[12:13:21] <NeoVoid[m]> I say it just a business tactics to attract more userbase. Feeding users with raining the eye candy features in daily basis mustnt come without some deep dark goal and profit.
[12:14:36] <NeoVoid[m]> If not the earthian involed i guess its safe to assume he might be involved with alien shit.

[19:35:44] <relejek[m]> Nikunj Chopra: wut news? source please
[19:36:53] <relejek[m]> coz i know a guy who got 3k USD bug hunting reward. they found and solved the bug for YELP. no job offer though.
[19:38:29] <relejek[m]> if someone from bihar got a job offer from google just coz  of a bug they found then that bug has to be grand, that is news in itself.

[20:12:53] <relejek[m]> <NikunjChopra[m]> "image.jpeg" <- okay buddy. here's the deal. unidentifiable FB posts are not news. you did share news link, i read it and did more research on this guy. and no where does it say that google did any that crap. News facts : 1. google awarded him 'hall of fame' there are over 1000 people on that list. 2. google added him ther 'researcher list' , it is a bug hunting program of google which has 10s of thousands of people.
[20:12:53] <relejek[m]> 3. he did find a priority-2 bug yet google said they'd only reward him if he finds priority-1/0.
[20:12:53] <relejek[m]> unless he is coming here for an AMA. don't wrongfully glorify just anyone. there are many hard-working people who don't do it for fame yet earn alot of respect.
[20:12:53] <relejek[m]> now please. remove this FB image.
[20:55:11] <iamak[m]> <ramram[m]> "yeah it is. btw tuxi was also..." <- What's tuxi?
[20:56:20] <AryaK> its a script that scrapes google results
[20:56:53] <AryaK> so it acts like a sorta google assistant ig
[21:02:42] <iamak[m]> So basically browsing Google from your terminal?
[21:04:18] <AryaK> no 
[21:04:26] <AryaK> it only shows highlight result
[21:07:15] <SlimshadyButSUS[> <ramram[m]> "https://xyproblem.info/" <- Naise article tho, does get rid of the confooson
[21:40:48] <Tor[m]> <Aaron[m]12> "Where can I watch Mr Robot?" <- If  you cuck then amazon or be a chad torrent it and seed it for other usee
