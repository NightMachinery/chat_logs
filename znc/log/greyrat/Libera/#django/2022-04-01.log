[03:47:43] <jim> I dunno, because I don't know what exceptional cases can come up during template rendering... but, my original question was: is there a termplate language or system that supports exception handling? or, are there plans to add it to the existing DTL?

[04:04:20] <PaulWay[w]> Don't worry about a problem that you don't know exists.
[04:05:30] <PaulWay[w]> The template rendering is supposed to take a set of data you supply in the view.
[04:05:33] <jim> that;s just it, I don't know
[04:06:47] <PaulWay[w]> Then you can safely assume there will be no exception.

[04:07:55] <jaybe> from a insta-design-think perspective, one would not likely choose to raise/show exceptions in a rendered view by default as it would be intrusive, revealing, ‚Ä¶
[04:08:17] <jaybe> those links do a great job of laying out how exceptions can be dealt with for html 404, and or for within templates, etc. it seems
[04:09:21] <GinFuyou> DTL surely raises exceptions: incorrect syntax, url reverse errors and such.
[04:09:35] <jim> yeah, also it seems to me, can deal with any exception in the view code
[04:10:37] <GinFuyou> * in middleware XD
[04:10:40] <jaybe> iirc in initial reading, there is a sort of 'exception layer' or onion-skin type view that can be enabled and or produced through css or enablement of some kind.   view code  and verbose reporting gets it done too.
[04:10:56] <PaulWay[w]> I feel like you're catastrophising here jim.
[04:11:24] <jim> it's a case like for building construction workers... if they did their thing the way programmers write programmers, then the first woodpecker that came along would have destroyed civilization
[04:11:39] <PaulWay[w]> If you have no specific example of an 'exception' which the template might have to 'handle', then you have no basis for asking whether or not templates handle exceptions.
[04:11:59] <PaulWay[w]> That analogy is crap.
[04:12:23] <PaulWay[w]> Because guess what.  The Tacoma Narrows Bridge broke.  There have been engineering and building failures over the years.
[04:12:27] <jim> curiousity is a perfect basis though :)
[04:12:36] <jaybe> i think jim made clear he is new'ish to django, just as i admittedly am, and was just asking to learn more and comprehend how any exception in ones code on a rendered page would be 'handled'
[04:12:38] <PaulWay[w]> Mechanical and structural engineering has improved over that time.
[04:13:00] <PaulWay[w]> Software engineers do the same thing.
[04:13:08] <PaulWay[w]> We learn, we use better patterns, we improve.
[04:13:13] <PaulWay[w]> Django is one of those better patterns.
[04:14:38] <PaulWay[w]> It already solves many problems that writing your own stuff from scratch will encounter.
[04:15:00] <PaulWay[w]> You need to think of the data process in very simple terms.
[04:15:01] <jaybe> that is one of the sincere reasons i am here :)
[04:15:13] <PaulWay[w]> Your view is where you collect the data.
[04:15:32] <PaulWay[w]> The view does the checks of whether the data is valid or safe or there.
[04:15:51] <PaulWay[w]> The view hands the safe, validated, correctly laid out data to the template, which renders it.
[04:16:03] <PaulWay[w]> If there's a problem with the data, the view handles that.

[08:45:58] <jeffre> Talk me out of it: I'm a micropreneur, with limited coding experience, but lots of enthusiasm for coding and (what I know of) software engingeering.  My business is a subscription-based podcast, and we're currently using Wix for the salse website, a hosting company for the mp3s and RSS, and a paywall company for the paywall.  But the hodjpoj of this costs us a lot of time, and (relatively speaking) a lot of money.  So I'm seriously
[08:45:58] <jeffre> considering building (everything, eventually) using Django, but starting with the website to see how it goes.  I've read through the basics of SE (Winters et al.), and I've got a solid collection of Django and Python books.  I've also read a fair bit about web security best practices.  What's going to get me?  What's going to make me regret doing this?
[08:47:45] <dre> in my experience, the actual doing it.
[08:47:56] <dre> code is a liability.
[08:48:18] <jeffre> I remember that phrase from Winters.
[08:48:32] <dre> the more code you have, unless your business /is code/. the worse off you'll be ( in my estimation)
[08:48:32] *** Joins: dor (~erg@188.147.36.181.nat.umts.dynamic.t-mobile.pl)
[08:49:09] <dre> but I don't know! if you want to code, and you feel like you can spend the time in doing it, then it's probably very worthwhile to
[08:49:39] <dre> I would generally prefer to have everything collected to one place, under my control ( like a django site) - in which I do that often
[08:50:08] <dre> but I personally get so stuck in coding, that most of the time I don't launch, or do much.
[08:50:34] <dre> seeming as you've already got a thing set up, I think you're in an ideal position, because you already have something that you can migrate over to your django setup, as it comes together.
[08:50:39] <jeffre> Yea, that's the only reason I'm considering it.  I love coding, and the podcast, to some extent, allows me to weave together the coding and content.  But not entirely.  ... And yea, the one-place thing is so attractive to me.
[08:50:42] *** Quits: PaulWay[w] (~PaulWay@203-174-143-46.can.static-ipl.aapt.com.au) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[08:50:59] <dre> yeah I totally get it
[08:51:29] <dre> I'd say focus on your goals and what you're getting out of it. If you want to actually code, and learn to code, etc, go for it.
[08:51:58] <jeffre> Right.
[08:52:30] <dre> If you simply wanted to make your setup cheaper, I'd say you could change wix -> github pages for instance, mp3s and RSS could be on another service, use stripe or patreon for paywall, etc.
[08:53:07] <dre> if all this stuff "costs you a lot of time" then doing it yourself often won't be better.
[08:53:43] <dre> writing code takes a lot of time. a hell of a lot of time. There's all sorts of walls you'll hit. you don't get nice wysiwyg editors like from wix.
[08:53:43] <jeffre> Yea.  The cost is only a factor, long-term, with the paywall (which is Stripe-based), because it's a percentage.  Everything else is fixed cost, and basically dirt cheap.  But the paywall is also (I think) the hardest part of the project, if I roll my own.
[08:54:19] <jeffre> Yea, yea.  That's probably my number 1 concern.
[08:54:24] <jeffre> The time explosion
[08:55:27] <dre> so you could roll your own paywall I think, I think it'll be easier than you imagine, for a simple case of podcast. but it'd probably remain stripe based. you'd have to look at stripe's pricing and see if it's worth the cost
[08:56:14] <dre> like if you were just going to say "I don't need content, everything else is sorted, etc. but we just need to make the paywall cheaper" then that's a suitable chunk with clear boundaries where you could dev it and have a decent shot of completion.
[08:56:21] <jeffre> I would almost certainly stay with Stripe.  So I would just write everything else, the customer interaction stuff, and the obscuration stuff.
[08:56:28] <dre> then you could build on from there if you really want.

[08:57:08] <dre> and django has some pretty good user auth stuff, so you could literally set up your server to only serve mp3s to people who are logged in. or even better, shoutcast / streamcast it ?? I think.
[08:57:28] <dre> to whoever's logged into their account ( and has paid, is a member, etc.)
[08:57:30] <jeffre> That stuff is soooo attractive to me.
[08:58:29] <dre> that's doable :) -- make a better paywall system, have it so people can log in, pay you money, access MP3. no pay, no MP3. then migrate your accounts over.
[08:58:30] <jeffre> It's as much a strategic business decision as a technical one.  My two hemispheres disagree.
[08:58:41] <dre> yep :D
[08:59:23] <jeffre> Ok, well I'm encouraged to hear you think the paywall is not as hard as it might seem.  .... thatnks for the response dre!
[09:00:22] <dre> just remember to always always keep it simple. if the customers are only accessing a login page, and an mp3 download link. do that.
[09:00:42] <dre> don't get stuck in the loop of "oh but I can also link all other mp3 and track whther they've heard it and ..."
[09:00:44] <dre> atleast, not yet.
[09:01:13] <dre> clearly define goals. push for that.
[09:02:00] <jeffre> Right, right.  I think I've got an instinctive fear of complexity.  I've definitely declared war on it in my code.  Probably to give my small brain a chance. :)

[09:02:44] <jeffre> Dijkstra said lots of helpful stuff about this.  In the same talk where he said the submarine thing.  [obscure ref]
[09:03:53] <jeffre> Something like: "The question of whether a computer can think is no more interesting than the question of whether a submarine can swim."  In that same talk, he said the real probelm in computing is controlling the complexity, because we can essentially build any thinkable mechanism.
[09:03:59] <jaybe> jeffre: hi

[09:04:57] <jeffre> cool, thanks.  I'll check it out.  jaybe are you recommending the whole course, or just the video on that page?
[09:05:05] <jaybe> yes
[09:05:06] <jaybe> ;)
[09:05:10] <jeffre> lol got it
[09:05:25] <jaybe> i'm not recommending anything; is what it is
[09:06:07] <jeffre> right.  I'm familiar with CS50 / Harvard, but haven't yet invested in it.  I'll dip a toe in the waters.  ....back to work!  Thanks jaybe and dre !
[09:06:20] <jaybe> jeffre: it's free/gratis; enjoy
[09:07:00] <jeffre> yea I meant the time investment.  I'm a micropreneur, I have no money. :)

[18:11:55] <pydev> do you think is correct to handle authentication inside a serilizer? something like: https://www.guguweb.com/2022/01/23/django-rest-framework-authentication-the-easy-way/
[18:12:11] <pydev> ...sounds weird to me
[18:15:31] <GinFuyou> pydev, why? It looks like complete analogue of default django auth to me
[18:16:20] <pydev> GinFuyou, usually we call authenticate() from a view...not from a model or other...so i wonder why should i put that inside a serializer instead of a classic view
[18:16:43] <GinFuyou> who are "we"?

[18:18:27] <GinFuyou> https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/auth/default/#how-to-log-a-user-in-1 you mean this?
[18:18:43] <GinFuyou> I think it's just an example how it fundamentally works
[18:19:11] <GinFuyou> I don't think anyone is actually using it in views
[18:20:06] <GinFuyou> Don't understand what you mean about serializer. It's just that, a tool to (de)serialize data
[18:20:33] <pydev> GinFuyou, exact, so why should i put the authenticate() there?
[18:20:33] <GinFuyou> since login-password pair is data...
[18:20:48] <pydev> GinFuyou, yes i mean that link
[18:21:01] <pydev> authenticate is usually used inside a view
[18:21:29] <GinFuyou> As I said I believe it's never used inside a view (directly)
[18:21:43] <GinFuyou> example in docs just a simplification
[18:22:12] <pydev> GinFuyou, pardon for thew question but...so are you calling it from a method inside the User model ?
[18:22:13] <GinFuyou> You can do it, there is no problem, but it's more logically goes into a form
[18:22:19] <pydev> you put the authenticate call there ?
[18:22:39] <pydev> ah ok

[18:26:43] <pydev> ?
[18:27:12] <pydev> in that case i think i should move it outside the serializer

[18:28:52] <pydev> sorry :)
[18:29:57] <GinFuyou> I guess argument for not putting login into a form or serializer is not mixing it with valid \ invalid handling
[18:30:21] <GinFuyou> form also by default doesn't have access to request in django
[18:31:02] <GinFuyou> so it only takes the job of validating credentials. Yeah sounds very reasonable
[18:31:16] <pydev> same thing for serializer, i need to pass the request
[18:31:18] <pydev>         serializer = LoginSerializer(
[18:31:18] <pydev>             data=self.request.data, context={"request": self.request}
[18:31:18] <pydev>         )
[18:31:30] <pydev> the context.
[18:32:07] <pydev> https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/serializers/#including-extra-context
[18:32:35] <GinFuyou> so technically you could login inside it I guess.
[18:32:49] <GinFuyou> I guess this is the question of separating concerns
[18:32:59] <pydev> yes, "technically" yes but as you said i think is bette rto separate
