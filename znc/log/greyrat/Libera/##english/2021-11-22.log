[00:13:17] <hajonnes> kiki_faithmaster, I still do not understand the question. Semantically 'a reason' and 'reason' (both could be nouns) differs as I would say, but not as strong, 'a divine law' and 'divine law'. What do you want to say by 'proper noun'? thant 'a divine law' is not a proper noun?

[00:17:54] <kiki_faithmaster> hajonnes, I think 'proper noun' is the wrong word for it, but I can't find what I mean in the internetf... One example: We say: "I have faith in you!", but we don't say: "I have a faith in you!"
[00:21:55] <kiki_faithmaster> the word 'faith' e.g. underlies a specific rule as it is a term that doesn't require an article, like 'water'.
[00:22:03] <LuisP14> abstract noun, supposedly

[06:38:42] <wannakiss> i found that out the hard way. used to hang with my best friend's older sister all the time. went to my first disco with her, had my first sip of alcohol with her and first puff of smoke
[06:39:26] <wannakiss> but one night a couple of years later at some other nightclub, she was walking next to me grabbing my hand real tight and i was like. "wow, i feel like the MAN!"
[06:40:41] <wannakiss> *grabbing my arm, i mean
[06:41:14] <wannakiss> "i feel like a pimp, and youre like my *bitch*". i never should have said that, she got so fucking angry :/ havent really spoken to her since, it ruined our relationship

[07:42:09] <Me-me> I'm sure there are some contexts where the exclusivity isn't even gendered, just a matter of being close enough.
[07:43:46] <bbju> Hi, guys. I was wondering if "BigBrotherJu" is appropriate for being used as a username on the internet. "Ju" is part of my first name. Does this name give native speakers a negative connotation? I'm kinda referring to Big Brother in 1984.
[07:45:03] <Me-me> I mean Big Brother has connotations of Orwell's book as well as the reality TV show. Ju, sans a specific context casting it in a specific light, I think is probably fine.
[07:45:18] <Me-me> So I'd say you're probably fine to use that as a username in most scenarios.

[17:15:32] <furrykef> Scansion is likely the reason, though that poem is a few hundred years old, so it's hard to be sure.

[17:20:00] <zaeph> Both Shakespeare and Milton were pretty good at eliding the E when it was not to be pronounced; in Dartmouth's edition, they render it as “fixt mind” which confirms the one-syllable parsing.
[17:21:05] <furrykef> The "e" was certainly pronounced in normal speech if you go far enough back in time; I don't know when exactly we started eliding it.

[17:22:45] <furrykef> I'm guessing during the transition from Middle to Early Modern English
[17:22:57] <zaeph> I haven't investigated this in my curriculum, but I'd say the standardisation of English, both in terms of writing and pronunciation, was spearheaded by the literary efforts of the times, and how widely shared they were with the new technologies.
[17:26:44] <furrykef> English was actually standardized a few different times, first with the Winchester Standard of Late West Saxon, then with the Chancery Standard of Middle English, then the KJV...
[17:29:07] <zaeph> Oh, sorry, you're right; I meant Modern English.
[17:29:14] <furrykef> Though Old and especially Middle English spelling was pretty chaotic despite these attempts at standardization.
[17:29:37] <furrykef> A bit of a pain for me since I've been compiling an Old English dictionary.
[17:29:52] <zaeph> I'm familiar with the different waves of standardisation, especially after the Norman Conquest.
[17:29:59] <furrykef> Ah.
[17:30:16] <zaeph> Such a cool endeavour on your end. :)
[17:30:23] <furrykef> Thanks
[17:30:34] <furrykef> You can see it in action here: http://oedict.furrykef.com/
[17:30:55] <furrykef> It's a little slow; it may take a few seconds to respond.
[17:31:22] <zaeph> It did; but it also worked!  Good for you!
[17:31:26] <furrykef> I need to work on that, but I've been meaning to move to another server and should probably complete the move before trying to optimize it. It may be that the new server reduces the need...
[17:32:00] <zaeph> As much as I wish I could advice, I have very little experience in this matter.  Best of luck, though.
[17:32:05] <furrykef> Thanks
[17:33:10] <zaeph> My own endeavour right now is to memorise the first book of Paradise Lost.  I've always been intrigued by one of our contemporaries who managed to memorise the whole 12 books, and I wanted to gauge if memorising even one of them was achievable.  I've started last week, just doing a little bit at a time, and I'm finally getting to the crunchy bits with Satan's speeches.
[17:34:16] <furrykef> I must say I've never tried to memorize a long text like that.
[17:34:17] <zaeph> (That's roughly 110 verses ouf of the 800 the first book contains, or of the 10.5k the whole epic does.)
[17:35:15] <zaeph> It comes pretty easily, especially if you're familiar with the text.  I did study it at uni for a time, and it's part of my imagination since.  There's just so much joy that comes from anatomising it.
[17:36:10] <zaeph> You start deciphering shades of meaning which would have completely eluded you regardless of how much you would have invested into it.  It truly is like building a cathedral in one's own head.
[17:36:12] <furrykef> I'm weird... I like to memorize noun and verb inflection tables. Lately I've been doing that with Icelandic.
[17:36:41] <furrykef> I used to hate memorizing tables but eventually I fell in love with it. I don't know why.
[17:37:14] <zaeph> I did this when I was a kid for French, like with the imperfect subjunctive.
[17:37:18] <furrykef> It helps that I practice them by typing now. I used to write them out with pencil and paper. I find that doesn't make the easier to memorize, it just makes it take longer and hurts my wrist.
[17:37:47] <furrykef> Yeah, Icelandic has that one. It's more usually called the past subjunctive in Germanic languages, but basically the same thing.
[17:38:27] <furrykef> *make them
[17:39:10] <zaeph> Oh, it's because we do differentiate perfect and imperfect subjunctive in French, and I think in other Romance languages?
[17:39:32] <furrykef> Right.
[17:39:40] <zaeph> Wait, no, I'm confusing myself I think.
[17:39:59] <zaeph> No-no, sorry, I was right. :D
[17:40:12] <zaeph> Should you wish to investigate: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/venir#Conjugation_3
[17:40:33] <furrykef> The terminology probably makes a bit more sense in Latin, where the perfect subjunctive is a simple tense rather than a compound tense.
[17:41:22] <zaeph> Yup.  Alright, that's enough nerd-sniping for me now; fare thee well, and talk to you later maybe!
[17:41:29] <furrykef> All righty, take care
[17:41:36] <zaeph> You too!

[18:03:27] <lpapp> hi, do you speak n*logn?
[18:03:41] <lpapp> I used to say n multipled by logn, but maybe it is shorter to say n star logn?
[18:03:53] <lpapp> how do you say*
[18:04:10] <Me-me> "N by log-n"
[18:04:33] <Me-me> The "multiplied" qualifier is implied.
[18:04:45] <lpapp> oh, okay, thanks.
[18:04:54] <Me-me> Happy to help.
[18:05:03] <lpapp> so, with the same analogy, n * m would be n by m.
[18:05:09] <Me-me> Yes.
[18:05:11] <lpapp> O(n + m), oh n by m
[18:05:17] <lpapp> O(n * m), oh n by m
[18:05:34] <lpapp> what about a/b?
[18:07:21] <lpapp> not sure if a divided by b can be shortened
[18:07:24] <Me-me> Well, though I am not a mathematician, my understanding is that putting a coefficient next to a bracket, that is also being used as a multiplier.
[18:07:30] <lpapp> as that would be understood as multiplication then
[18:07:39] <Me-me> So O(n * m) would be O by n by m, using that logic.
[18:07:48] <Me-me> a/b is "a over b".
[18:08:09] <Me-me> I think perhaps ##math would have more informed answers on the topic.
[18:08:43] <lpapp> ok, thanks, what about a^b?
[18:08:44] <Me-me> s/that putting/that when putting/
[18:08:45] <chat> Me-me meant to say: Well, though I am not a mathematician, my understanding is that when putting a coefficient next to a bracket, that is also being used as a multiplier.
[18:08:45] <lpapp> a caret b
[18:08:49] <Me-me> "a to the b"
[18:10:34] <lpapp> Thanks. Hope I did not miss any possible combination of a and b.
[18:10:41] <Me-me> Oh there are plenty.
[18:10:43] <lpapp> I mean a plus b and a minus b are obvious
[18:11:13] <Me-me> Modulo, for example.
[18:11:29] <lpapp> yeah, modulo is obvious for me, too, thanks.
[18:11:48] <lpapp> a modulo b
[18:12:10] <Me-me> Sine, cosine, tangent.
[18:12:47] <lpapp> so, a quadratic expression would be like n^2, n to the two.
[18:13:30] <Me-me> There's also an indefinite number of transformations to be found for repetition - (a + a) b times is a * b, (a * a) b times is a ^ b, and e.g. (a ^ a) b times.
[18:13:38] <Me-me> Correct.

[18:22:43] <zaeph> Personally, I've always used “n log n” (i.e. with no connector), although that's perhaps not correct.  If that is for a programming interview, I'd also suggest to stick with the tide and not make too much of an original of yourself.
[18:25:31] <Me-me> If they judge you for using correct english ... I mean I wouldn't turn down a job that does, but I'm not going to speak incorrectly on purpose to get it either.

[18:27:20] <lpapp> yes, I agree. Speaking correct English is the best.
[18:27:47] <lpapp> I doubt any reasonable company would take that negatively. I think they would take it positively :)
[18:30:18] <Me-me> Anyway see ya
[18:30:28] <zaeph> Bye~.
[18:31:42] <zaeph> It's not about speaking “proper” English in my mind; just like with every professional setting, you have to match the Zeitgeist, which means not creating too much contrast with your peers.  If you happen to be the only candidate that use “by” in between “n” and “log-n”, you're going to stand out against the candidates who probably never asked themselves that questions, nor your
[18:31:43] <zaeph> interviewer.
[18:32:08] <zaeph> As a result, despite your best effort to be correct, they will be for naught if it is parsed as a mistake by the person interviewing you.
[18:32:39] <zaeph> There are many places and times to be factually correct; a job interview isn't amongst them.
[18:32:49] <zaeph> …At least not for a programming job.
[18:33:30] <zaeph> Believe me, it pains me as much as it does you.
[18:33:31] <lpapp> depends, some companies do not hire sheeps
[18:33:46] <lpapp> some companies check out for people standing up for their values
[18:33:53] <zaeph> Well, then you're stuck in the unicorn quandary, and I bid you “good luck” for it.
[18:33:56] <lpapp> correctness, etc, whatever it may be.
[18:33:56] <Coinflipper> lpapp: you should probably take a look at this link: https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/28155/pronunciation-of-the-big-o-notation. I assume you are talking about bigO notations rather than math equations. 
[18:34:14] <zaeph> It's not about standing up here; you wouldn't even be given such a chance.
[18:35:29] <lpapp> you do not have to lose yourself to find a job where you can be you.
[18:36:02] <lpapp> it is ok for interviewers to learn proper English from interviewees if so :)
[18:36:28] <zaeph> Also, I find it a little odd to prefer what general English dictates as “right” when mathematical English, for all intents and purposes, might very well qualify as its own subset of English where some rules may be overruled in the favour of ease of communication.
[18:36:37] <lpapp> Coinflipper: I have personally never heard "order" by others, but admittedly, I have not spoken a whole lot about it.
[18:36:49] <lpapp> To me, the not accepted anwers feels more inline with my experience.
[18:37:14] <zaeph> I agree with you, just so that we may defuse whichever aura of conflict might have developed from our exchange.

[22:49:01] <Jong> https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles. "Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers."
[22:49:26] <Jong> I do not think customers want people they do business with to obsess over them. That would make me feel uncomfortable if someone obsessed over me.
[22:49:37] <LjL> i think it's a little weird and unusual to say you're "obsessed" with customers and customer service anyway... but, well, people do try to find novel and unusual ways to convey how much better they are at taking your money while making you feel like it's a bargain
[22:49:53] <LjL> than... ebay, i suppose. which is easy. but also google, which is harder.

[22:50:21] <bin> Jong: it's somewhat hyperbolic
[22:50:27] <bin> it's not a literal, unhealthy obsession
[22:50:28] <Jong> Why not "They care about customers" instead of "they obsess over customers"
[22:50:33] <bin> because hyperbole
[22:50:40] <bin> it's stronger
[22:50:46] <LjL> Jong, because that would be common and boring, and we wouldn't be here discussing it
[22:51:01] <bin> every company claims to care about their customers, but how many strive to obsess over them?
[22:51:03] <bin> it's good marketing
[22:51:05] <LjL> people like that want other people to discuss and propagate their statements
[22:51:11] <bin> and it contributes to a customer-first company culture
[22:52:34] <Jong> bin good marketing until it scares customers away
[22:52:43] <bin> it doesn't
[22:53:01] <bin> there are negative obsessions and positive ones

[22:53:58] <Jong> Okay. Thanks for explaining all this to me guys
[22:54:25] <bin> "Omg I'm obsessed with this new lip gloss"
[22:54:37] <bin> it doesn't mean they have a pathological issue
[22:54:46] <bin> just that they really, really love the new lip gloss
[22:54:50] <Bayes> why is missile ˈmisəl and not ˈmisīl ? is it because the second syllable is unstressed?
[22:54:55] <bin> "obsessed with customer satisfaction" is the same kind of thing
[22:55:02] <bin> it means super heavily focused on
[22:55:11] <Jong> I bet you can't come up with an example of someone saying they're obsessed with someone else, and it not sounding cringy
[22:55:11] <bin> Bayes: both are valid
[22:55:20] <bin> Jong: I just did lol
[22:55:30] <bin> "I'm obsessed with this new song"
[22:55:43] <bin> "I'm obsessed with my new book"
[22:55:45] <bin> etc
[22:55:47] <Jong> obsessed with [non-living-thing] doesn't sound bad
[22:55:58] <bin> "I'm obsessed with my new puppy"
[22:56:15] <bin> "I'm obsessed with this new job"
[22:56:24] <Jong> Okay I got it
[22:56:30] <Jong> I'm obsessed with chatting on irc
[22:56:35] <bin> yeah
[22:56:42] <bin> it doesn't mean anything unhealthy
[22:56:44] <LjL> ↑ definitely pathological
[22:57:02] <bin> it's not necessarily like "obsessive compulsive disorder" where someone has an obsession that is unhealthy and pathological
[22:57:03] <bin> lol LjL 
[22:58:21] <Bayes> bin I think it's ˈmisəl in AmE?
