[00:09:05] <znf> da_wunder, we get it in the site's error_log
[00:09:56] <znf> my colleague managed to get this when it happened (I was out) https://pastie.dev/q1USwa.yaml
[00:11:11] <da_wunder> this SO issue looks quite similar - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34131252/call-to-undefined-function-define
[00:11:38] <znf> yeah, we've read that

[00:12:10] <da_wunder> just to be clear - you're not using Windows?
[00:12:19] <znf> no, we are not using Windows :)
[00:12:32] <da_wunder> ok, so that is ruled out then
[00:13:19] <znf> LiteSpeed, with the lsapi SAPI, PHP 7.4, cPanel, Imunify360 (WAF), and CloudLinux's isolation (ie: a solution baked on cgroups)
[00:14:05] <da_wunder> then I would recommend to create an issue to wordpress repository about that - and first look if there is similar issue(s) already
[00:14:45] <da_wunder> oh, looks like wordpress doesn't use github issues at all - so you need to find how to report an issue to that project
[00:15:30] <lembron> "memory issue" certainly taps into the "php itself hit the shitter" corner
[00:15:42] <znf> I don't think it's an wordpress issue, as even a "standard" phpinfo() will fail under that account
[00:16:22] <da_wunder> so what is the difference between "that" account versus others that are working?
[00:16:29] <znf> sadly, it happens randomly and we have no way of reproducing it
[00:16:41] <znf> da_wunder, beats me, we have hundreds of accounts under a similar setup
[00:16:54] <znf> greanted - other servers
[00:17:37] <znf> the only difference is that on this server we have packages with a huge share of resources
[00:18:13] <da_wunder> znf: "similar setup" is the thing - check how those are diffent - and start to rule out possible differences until you find the actual issue
[00:18:15] <znf> We have 2 other accounts on this server, but I'd guess their requirements are lower
[00:18:36] <znf> as in, they have very simplistic pages (compared to the behemoth that is this wordpress install)
[00:19:19] <znf> da_wunder, we've looked at everything we could think of already, hence why I'm asking people for any random idea what we may not have thought
[00:19:21] <da_wunder> or start with opposite way - apply excatly same configuration to that fail site with one of those that don't fail - and start to add those differences one by one and see which of those will make it fail
[00:19:46] <znf> right now we've disabled opcache for the account/website in case
[00:20:25] <znf> I'm hoping it still happens, because that would be the first time I'd see opcache being involved in something like this
[00:21:07] <da_wunder> znf: I would recommend to use _exactly_ same configuration that some of your sites that doesn't have this problem first and then start to bring in those different configuration that doesn't exists on ok setup
[00:21:47] <biberu> ^ are your configurations version controlled?
[00:22:00] <znf> that would be hard to replicate exactly, we do have standardized PHP configuration across all our servers already
[00:22:09] <znf> biberu, we use ansible to deploy
[00:22:35] <znf> *but* we do allow users to alter some PHP variables (like memory_limit) to suit their needs
[00:23:04] <da_wunder> so really you don't know what users have changed...
[00:23:26] <znf> we do, actually, as each user has it's own override file
[00:24:00] <da_wunder> ok, so first thing I would do if there was one - I would just remove that and see if that same error occurs
[00:24:01] <znf> plus we whitelist only a small subset of variables they can alter
[00:24:15] <da_wunder> and really look, what that custom configuration contains
[00:24:24] <znf> I just checked, there's no override for this user, so he's using the defaults the server provides
[00:24:58] <da_wunder> so that same should then happen also on other customers who are using the same setup - right?
[00:25:04] <znf> y
[00:25:05] <biberu> is it possible to deploy his setup to another machine?
[00:25:32] <znf> https://pastie.dev/5fdA5a.ini - this is the list of variables we allow them to set for themselves
[00:25:37] <da_wunder> then - those setups aren't the same - there is some difference
[00:26:12] <znf> biberu, sadly no, licensing costs to bring up a new identical machine are a bit steep
[00:26:16] <da_wunder> I would check that you're using exactly same PHP version on those "same" instances

[00:28:30] <da_wunder> but still there must be something _different_ if instance A works but instance B doesn't - specially if the environment is the same and configuration for that is the same - there must be some difference in some layer
[00:29:02] <biberu> znf: sure, the thought was just to try things that eliminate classes of error sources
[00:29:27] <biberu> eliminates*
[00:30:01] <znf> we also can not migrate the account to the lower-tier servers that serve hundreds of users, sadly

[00:41:29] <Stanley> (I don't actually have a problem with this anywhere I'm just curious)

[03:27:41] <olle> Hmmm

[03:33:06] <olle> https://odan.github.io/2020/04/05/slim4-multiple-pdo-database-connections.html
[03:33:12] <olle> Here they just create another class
[03:34:21] <Blondie101010> why would you need more than one class that does the exact same thing?
[03:34:39] <Blondie101010> that the point of using the same class
[03:34:58] <olle> Blondie101010: Only for the DI to get it.
[03:35:11] <Blondie101010> what?
[03:35:25] <olle> The dependency injection framework only has information regarding the class name
[03:35:31] <Blondie101010> yes
[03:35:32] <olle> I assume :)
[03:35:47] <Blondie101010> why do you need a PDO class for every DB?
[03:35:52] <Blondie101010> it's the same PDO
[03:35:56] <olle> So how would you include db connection string in a function signature?
[03:36:29] <Blondie101010> I don't get your concern
[03:36:42] <Blondie101010> DI only means to pass dependencies
[03:36:45] <Blondie101010> so pass them
[03:36:52] <olle> Two different databases. Two different connections.
[03:36:57] <Blondie101010> so what
[03:37:12] <Blondie101010> 2 instances of 1 class
[03:37:13] <olle> I'm talking about the automagic wiring of DI frameworks.
[03:37:24] <Blondie101010> no, you're thinking of something wrong
[03:37:29] <olle> When they use reflection and configs to figure out what to send to a class/functions.
[03:37:35] <olle> hehe
[03:37:40] <Blondie101010> if you use reflection, you're wrong
[03:37:55] <Blondie101010> obviously besides testing and such
[03:38:30] <olle> I mean, you could do a connection service container and ask for connections from that one. But that's just a factory, more or less.
[03:38:46] <olle> Blondie101010: Eh? I thought all DI frameworks used reflection?
[03:38:52] <olle> Maybe just configs
[03:39:35] <Blondie101010> you seemingly care about something still a bit unclear to me, but which will produce flaky code
[03:40:26] <olle> Blondie101010: Did you check the slim blog post?
[03:40:35] <Blondie101010> why would i?
[03:40:42] <olle> "
[03:40:42] <olle> With autowiring, the DI container simply maps a string (e.g. a fully qualified class name) to an object. Since PDO::class can only be mapped once, we have to come up with something else."
[03:40:48] <olle> Blondie101010: To understand xD
[03:41:28] <Blondie101010> olle:  I still can't put my finger on it, but there's a major flaw in your reasoning
[03:41:42] <Blondie101010> the program doesn't write itself or make itself simple or bugless
[03:42:56] <olle> Sure, sure
[03:43:07] <Blondie101010> what I mean by that is that you, the programmer, are responsible for defining how it operates
[03:43:38] <olle> "Autowiring is an exotic word that represents something very simple: the ability of the container to automatically create and inject dependencies."
[03:43:43] <olle> "
[03:43:43] <olle> In order to achieve that, PHP-DI uses PHP's reflection to detect what parameters a constructor needs."
[03:43:49] <olle> https://php-di.org/doc/autowiring.html
[03:43:49] <Blondie101010> if you just cross your fingers and hope to use a magical framework that will do everything you want just by wishing it, but that will also result in code that won't be troubleshootable
[03:44:44] <Blondie101010> not judging that last link, examples of bad code are EASY to find

This is generally not a good approach as explained on https://richardmiller.co.uk/2011/05/19/when-dependency-injection-goes-wrong/ - Type hinting by class name vs interface name.

[16:51:47] <Blondie101010> it's a pecl extension, so you build it after

[16:52:54] <Naktibalda> if it is documented, in PHP Manual, read Installation page: https://www.php.net/manual/en/imagick.installation.php

[17:00:12] <olle> 0o
[17:00:14] <__adrian> strongly recommmend against writing php code to file at runtime
[17:00:24] <olle> Nice
[17:00:39] <olle> __adrian: Well, Yii uses PHP as config format, and we need to search and replace some stuff
[17:00:53] <__adrian> that doesn't sound like a runtime activity  ;)
[17:01:04] <olle> It must be automated, so?
[17:01:10] <olle> What's the alternative?
[17:02:12] <olle> It's on the SaaS, for each instance
[17:05:27] <__adrian> is it somethinng you're going to need to do on a regular basis? or once/infrequently to fix things up?
[17:05:38] <Blondie101010> olle:  configuration management is not usually done in PHP
[17:05:49] <__adrian> sounds like something that might be done in dev or as part of a build process
[17:05:50] <olle> __adrian: It's for moving instances between machines
[17:05:57] <Blondie101010> template your config to be suitable for your deployment tools
[17:06:34] <Blondie101010> ie: that tool does NOT have to know PHP
[17:06:39] <__adrian> so a deployment (or migration) tool
[17:06:42] <Blondie101010> just replace tags
[17:07:17] <__adrian> php as a config format is not ideal, but that's at least isolat-able
[17:07:56] <biberu> olle: sed ^^
[17:08:09] <olle> biberu: thought about it :)
[17:08:32] <Blondie101010> doesn't matter what tool you use...  what mostly matters is how sane your TAGS are
[17:08:55] <Blondie101010> don't make it replace a previous IP with a new one, make it replace a tag like HOST_IP
[17:08:59] <biberu> ^

[17:10:16] <olle> With var_export we can just read the config with include, so
[17:11:04] <Blondie101010> what is your deployment/migration tool?
[17:11:18] <olle> Blondie101010: in-house
[17:11:26] <Blondie101010> never heard of it :P
[17:11:38] <olle> I mean, we built everything
[17:12:12] <biberu> olle: why are you creating this config file with var_export? why can't it just look like <?php return [ 'MY_VAR' => '__MY_VAR__', ...] and then you replace those tags on deploy?
[17:12:37] <olle> biberu: It's already deployed, but when we move it, we have to keep the config, becasue it can be customized.
[17:13:09] <olle> So yes, at installation, we do have tags :)
[17:13:14] <biberu> sounds like deploys can't be repeated?
[17:13:24] <Blondie101010> well if you want to treat it as a config file, just copy the files and adjust the config manually
[17:14:21] <olle> Blondie101010: Manually is no-go, we might move hundres of instances
[17:14:40] <Blondie101010> so make good templates as I said
[17:15:11] <__adrian> use a tool to customize your configs and keep them under source control
[17:15:17] <biberu> also let the person who allowed for manual customization handle it ;)
[17:15:18] <__adrian> (separate source control)
[17:16:42] <olle> biberu: That's the real solution - keep custom config in db

[17:45:05] <The_Blod-> Yes. Yes I am. :)
[17:45:07] <judah> I would try the flysystem library
[17:45:10] <The_Blod-> Server for PHP.
[17:45:20] <__adrian> well, as always, you are free to do what you want  :)
[17:45:31] <The_Blod-> My goal is to transfer files from the htdocs folder on my phone to a server.
[17:45:31] <judah> https://packagist.org/packages/league/flysystem-ftp
[17:45:45] <judah> Though you should just use plain FTP
[17:45:59] <The_Blod-> FTP externally from PHP right?
[17:46:09] <__adrian> i'd use a separate app. but you can also have a file upload script on your server
[17:46:11] <The_Blod-> scp may be support by Android...I could check that.
[17:46:29] <The_Blod-> adrian that's a good shout.
[17:46:49] <The_Blod-> Thanks judah let me check that package.
[17:47:28] <The_Blod-> I don't have composer on my system.
[17:48:14] <The_Blod-> I can try the file upload method
[17:49:12] <The_Blod-> Thank you guys.

[18:11:20] <Nekomander> Hi olle, I saw the topic about autowiring thing. Yes it does autowiring because it reads the Typehints, and then automatically create an instance to auto-inject dependencies and so on. This is generally not a good approach as explained on https://richardmiller.co.uk/2011/05/19/when-dependency-injection-goes-wrong/ - Type hinting by class name vs interface name.

[18:11:56] <stenno> i assume rsync uses something like scp under the hood anyway, its just a much more convenient interface
[18:14:05] <Nekomander> olle, oh yeah, also, this too: https://paste.gg/p/anonymous/32e68961a45f4b97a806c6261d2dcf05

[18:24:23] <olle> Nekomander: Uh, post does not list the solution in code...?
[18:25:06] <olle> I do not agree with the conclusion. Too black-and-white.
[18:25:54] <Nekomander> It's not in code.
[18:26:13] <Nekomander> "If we keep doing this we will end up at the top, at what ever the point of entry is. This is not a bad thing as we have now effectively separated the creation of our objects from their use. "
[18:26:27] <olle> What's the point of complaining if you're not showing the solution? :)
[18:28:41] <Nekomander> olle, you can't imagine at all what the code would look like after seeing 1 example of how they removed the "new" keyword out of the BlogPost, and then did the same in the Controller?
[18:28:44] *** Quits: delboy1978uk (~delboy197@d51A4773C.access.telenet.be) (Quit: delboy1978uk)
[18:29:27] <Nekomander> They show 2 examples that did the same thing. Basically: Don't do "new CLASS", pass in through constructor or method.
[18:29:35] *** Joins: delboy1978uk (~delboy197@d51A4773C.access.telenet.be)
[18:30:44] <olle> Nekomander: Sure
[18:31:11] <olle> But that's the point of DI in the first place?
[18:31:18] <olle> Or, no implicit dependencies
[18:31:34] <Nekomander> It moves the new keyword somewhere else. The point is, just because you've fixed your BlogPost {} to be more flexible, that does not mean you are done yet. You do the same with the Controller, and you repeat again as necessary until you're "at the top". (probably when you're in the php file that is creating the controller via new Controller($something);)
[18:32:34] <Nekomander> When you are at the Top, this is what's generally called the "Root Composition", the place where a lot of objects are created/dependencies being injected and so on.
[18:33:25] <olle> Yes
[18:33:49] <Nekomander> The "main" script that starts everything. This is often index.php, dependencies.php, it's also where di containers are used at.
[18:34:10] <olle> I'm all with you so far :)

[18:37:35] <Nekomander> As far as the conclusion is concerned, it's not always easy to know if an abstraction is necessary or not. That's usually discovered after many iterations on the project. (e.g. First the project was mysql-only. Now it is possible to use postgresql. We thought we only needed PHP's default session manager, but ended up creating one that can use redis, sql, etc.)
[18:38:11] <olle> Nekomander: I'd ask myself, can we do 50% test coverage with unit-test only, no integrity tests?
[18:39:41] <Nekomander> The conclusion does tell the truth that as long as you follow that pattern "if you want to create easily testable, loosely coupled code". That makes no mention of integrity tests which is a different topic.
[18:41:20] <Naktibalda> Nekomander: my issue wan't a bug, token_get_all has TOKEN_PARSE flag which makes it work correctly.
[18:41:40] <Nekomander> Naktibalda, ah, that makes a lot of sense.
[18:41:59] <Naktibalda> it is documented, so not a bug :)
[18:43:41] <Nekomander> For an integrity test, just because it is an integrity test, this does not change the fact that you can execute those class files separately. (you have your normal index.php for the integrity test. But you also have test.php that is able to execute any PHP class you have written so far without needing to run the ENTIRE PROJECT as one would in an integrity test.)
[18:43:47] <Nekomander> Does that make sense?

[18:56:29] <relipse> What is a shorter synonym for "Take picture/browse"
[18:57:15] <TinoDidriksen> Those are rather unrelated actions.
[18:57:40] <relipse> maybe i should disable the word "browse" on cameras
[18:57:44] <relipse> i mean phones
[18:58:01] <relipse> <input type="file" id="image_3" name="image_3" accept="image/*" capture="camera"  />

[18:58:44] <Nekomander> olle, in other words, test.php is like index.php, except you are only executing a small amount of classes. Usually no more than 3 classes. Compared to an integration test. You do not have to alter any class files to perform tests and it does not require executing unnecessary classes for the test, this is what I mean by it makes no difference.
[18:59:36] <Nekomander> How is any of this affecting the Conclusion?

[19:01:04] <Nekomander> If you keep the new keyword out of your classes (except for where it is necessary for things like Factor for example that can dynamically create stuff the client needs), how is that affecting the conclusion?
[19:04:13] <Nekomander> Integrity and unit testing is unrelated. Unit test takes 1 class, test the methods. Integrity tests a feature, or a usecase, an action like a button to push and then to check what the outcome looks like after pushing said button.
[19:04:45] <__adrian> i think the point is that class X { __construct() { $this->y = new Y; } } → class X { __construct(protected Y $y) {} } doesn't really solve anything if class A { __construct() { $this->x = new X(new Y); } }

[19:08:58] <olle> Well
[19:09:16] <olle> Depends on where your business logic is located
[19:09:35] <olle> But I don't think we'll agree ^^
[19:09:52] <Nekomander> I do not see how this has anything to do with where the business logic is at.
[19:10:01] <olle> My point of view is to lift out side-effects from the functional core
[19:10:09] <olle> "new" is one side-effect
[19:11:11] <Nekomander> That blog is not going to talk about all kinds of side effects, such as global keywords. The article is armed at people who knows a bit about dependency injection and aren't trying to use globals willy-nilly.

[19:12:46] <olle> Alright
[19:12:50] <Nekomander> Class for typehints is debatable and there are exceptions, like PDO as a typehint. PDO is abstract enough.
[19:14:18] <Nekomander> It can be argued that it is its own interface. But for people who needs more abstraction (pdo vs mysqli for example) - They can remove the PDO type hint and swap that in for Interface.
