[01:41:41] <Khaytsus> He was asking about _logs
[01:47:06] <MetaNova> comrumino: I'd be interested to hear how a regular, unprivileged other user is going to gain access to my (or his, or anyone else's) logs, particularly when they can't even reference /their own/ physical logs
[01:47:37] <MetaNova> and then how fishlim or any other OTR-like solution bares any relation to this
[01:49:21] <MetaNova> and since I like learning new things, please, take your time to construct a thorough explanation
[01:49:31] <MetaNova> I'll wait.
[01:50:17] <comrumino> b/c you reuse your password solution everywhere obvi
[01:50:34] <Khaytsus> I asume they were saying if the machine/znc/etc is itself compromised
[01:50:44] <comrumino> ^
[01:50:55] <Khaytsus> But again, had nothing to do with the actual original question ;)
[01:51:15] <comrumino> I am joking, but since encrypting the disk would be an obvi answer. I assumed he meant encrypting messages to a particular target.
[01:51:17] <comrumino> if he isn't
[01:51:21] <MetaNova> if unauthorized access is obtained, you metaphorically burn that install to the ground and start over
[01:51:22] <comrumino> I'd say cronjob?
[01:51:37] <comrumino> I burn it all down for sport :D
[01:51:37] <MetaNova> it doesn't sound like this is what they were asking
[01:52:17] <comrumino> I've never really used multi-user znc. wouldnt that app prevent cross-user read of logs?
[01:52:35] <MetaNova> not just that
[01:52:57] <comrumino> "other users" is vague so I just took a stab at it *shrugs*
[01:53:24] <MetaNova> if a regular user loads *log, they can't actually ever read those logs without shell or other, external access outside ZNC
[01:53:59] <comrumino> like /msg *backlog #znc 100
[01:54:14] <comrumino> an external module. but I think that is still locked down to user
[01:54:59] <comrumino> I mean a cronjob would do the trick. not sure what is retention/protection model is though
[01:55:33] <MetaNova> that is an external module, hurdle number one, and even if they could call backlog they would only see their own logs
[01:56:08] <comrumino> maybe he is sharing account creds :D
[01:56:53] <MetaNova> in that case who gives a shit, they're effectively sending the other person a daily digest email of what personal things they spoke about today

[07:13:18] <Andrio> Also check that the module isn't itself limiting the buffer size for that client.
[07:17:02] <Khaytsus> yes, use SASL on networks that support it.  And those that don't just put your password in the server password field.

[19:37:04] <tuvok> i have install the ubunut mashine new
[19:37:21] <Khaytsus> Just install the debian packages
[19:37:30] <Khaytsus> apt install znc  done
[19:37:35] <tuvok> yes i have install all this package but i get no yes on the table hm
[19:37:55] <tuvok> i compile this with hand with ./configure ..
[19:38:08] <Khaytsus> apt install znc 
[19:38:18] <tuvok> no
[19:38:24] <Khaytsus> Then read the installation wiki page.
[19:38:25] <tuvok> i would like install it with hand
[19:39:06] <Khaytsus> And you really should just use the distro packages.......
[19:40:28] <MetaNova> tuvok: if you are going to compile from source
[19:40:34] <MetaNova> sudo apt-get build-dep znc
[19:40:52] <MetaNova> then do all your ./configure and blamo, done
[19:42:09] <MetaNova> and btw if you are specifically and intentionally going to compile perl/python support, those need to be specified. they are not compiled by default
[19:42:18] <tuvok> ok
[19:42:36] <tuvok> i have create the bulild folder and have make cmake to show what run and what not
[19:42:56] <MetaNova> that is not necessary
[19:43:07] <MetaNova> configure is just a cmake wrapper
[19:43:23] <tuvok> but i will not install znc from apt..
[19:43:36] <MetaNova> do ./configure <your desired arguments here> then make and sudo make install
[19:43:48] <tuvok> i have do it
[19:43:50] <tuvok> it run but
[19:43:53] <tuvok> i get not the package
[19:43:56] <tuvok> what i need
[19:44:20] <MetaNova> I require full sentences with context in order to understand your questions
[19:44:27] <tuvok> ok
[19:44:51] <tuvok> öhm i make this wget https://znc.in/releases/znc-1.8.2.tar.gz;tar -xzvf znc-1.8.2.tar.gz;cd znc-1.8.2;./configure --prefix=/home/$USER/znc/;make;make install;cd ..
[19:45:00] <tuvok> than is the znc finish and it run
[19:45:03] <tuvok> but the package are not in
[19:45:11] <MetaNova> that --prefix is wrong
[19:45:19] <tuvok> hm it run?
[19:45:24] <tuvok> hm
[19:45:52] <MetaNova> where are you installing this? do you have administrative access?
[19:45:57] <tuvok> yes
[19:46:24] <MetaNova> why are you specifically installing it to your home directory?
[19:46:43] <tuvok> i install it on a user without root access?
[19:47:07] <tuvok> on the maschine but i will install some package
[19:47:13] <tuvok> https://nopaste.net/76BJtbl4XS
[19:47:37] <tuvok> for charset it was the package apt-get install pkg-config libicu-dev
[19:47:57] <MetaNova> you said you have administrative access. why are you installing it to your home directory?
[19:48:13] <tuvok> [17:16] <tuvok> i install it on a user without root access?
[19:48:27] <MetaNova> do or do you not have sudo access?
[19:48:34] <tuvok> on this user not
[19:48:52] <tuvok> not all user have sudo rights :)
[19:49:05] <MetaNova> then when I ask why you are installing it to your home directory why not just say that is because you cannot install it globally
[19:49:09] <tuvok> but this is not what i need i need only the answer what i need for | Zlib      : no         |
[19:49:14] <MetaNova> is that such a difficult thing
[19:49:29] <MetaNova> tuv0k: next question. why are you compiling from sourcee?
[19:49:59] <MetaNova> does your admin not have ZNC installed on the machine, regularly?
[19:50:44] <tuvok> NO
[19:50:45] <tuvok> !
[19:50:47] <tuvok> You don't answer questions with a question, I just want to know what packages I need to compile certain things 
[19:50:57] <MetaNova> ...
[19:50:57] <tuvok> thats all
[19:51:55] <PeGaSuS> isn't zlib an Ubuntu package? 
[19:52:27] <MetaNova> I am not able to provide support for someone who is not able to adequately explain their situation and circumstance
[19:52:40] <PeGaSuS> probably zlib1g(-dev)
[19:52:47] <tuvok> ah thx PeGaSuS
[19:53:03] *** Joins: Pippin_ (Pippin_@openvpn/community/Pippin)
[19:53:21] <tuvok> zlib1g-dev - compression library - development
[19:53:25] <tuvok> thats the package! :)
[19:54:07] <PeGaSuS> it's amazing how Google can save our asses sometimes...
[19:54:23] <tuvok> i have search this on the znc wiki its tricky
[19:54:40] <PeGaSuS> https://www.google.com/search?q=zlib+ubuntu&oq=zlib+ub&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0i512j0i22i30l7.14590j0j4&client=ms-android-xiaomi-rvo3&sourceid=chrome-mobile&ie=UTF-8&chrome_dse_attribution=1#sbfbu=1&pi=zlib%20ubuntu
[19:54:53] <MetaNova> it's amazing how many users do not even attempt to solve their own problems, before they make it someone else's
[19:55:15] <PeGaSuS> I just Google'd for "zlib Ubuntu" and the magic happened
[19:55:26] <MetaNova> yeah, funny how that works
[19:55:45] <PeGaSuS> ;D
[19:56:15] <PeGaSuS> I suppose that you have your "mind reader" out of service? :P
[19:56:19] <tuvok> MetaNova but you do make more problems as i have :) where do i install it .. why i have no root sudo access to the user and and and :)
[19:56:42] <MetaNova> tuvok: I cannot help someone when I do not understand what they need
[19:57:03] <tuvok> i have only ask for the package what i need to compile it to znc
[19:57:06] <tuvok> not more
[19:57:19] <tuvok> thats all :) but thanks for your time
[19:57:49] <MetaNova> ...

[22:06:15] <beastDivision> I have znc setup using lets encrypt with nginx for a reverse proxy according to the wiki, if I connect to the "up stream" part with just plain username and password,it will be encrypted because of the SSL on nginx right? or do I have to further setup 'certauth' module or something to get encryption when logging in to znc from a client

[23:50:20] <DoctorD90> hello DarthGandalf excuse me, but .... if ZNC already uses SSL, what may be the need of using NGINX?
[23:50:51] <DarthGandalf> DoctorD90: [[reverse proxy]]
