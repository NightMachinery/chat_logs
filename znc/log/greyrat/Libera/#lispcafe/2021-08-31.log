[01:15:23] <gilberth> Problematic then are all the glyphs that are not in the Adobe fonts. Like those which are used to construct large parens like for matrixes.

[05:01:33] <gilberth> I often feel tempted to use -en as a plural suffix for words ending on [aeuio]x like "ox", which has the plural "oxen".
[05:02:07] <copec> "boxen" as the pural for multiple computer boxes has been common for a long time
[05:02:50] <gilberth> Must be the germanic roots of English.
[05:03:38] <copec> oxen in the West are our classic beast of burden, so it was natural for someone to call their working servers boxen I think

[05:05:39] <hayley> Reminds me, I am contemplating giving my dad's machine a NVMe drive with a NVMe-PCIe x1 adapter, as there is only a spare x1 connector on this stupid motherboard I bought 4 years ago.

[05:06:41] <gilberth> Why can't it be used as a boot disk?
[05:06:54] <copec> That is a limitation of a lot of hardware

[05:07:55] <gilberth> Hardware? You perhaps mean software. And isn't it a PCI device? Doesn't it come with a BIOS?
[05:07:57] <White_Flame> gen 3 x1 is almost 1gigabyte/sec
[05:08:10] <copec> probably gen 4, but even if gen 3 it is faster than 6 gig sata
[05:08:10] <hayley> 3 IIRC.
[05:08:24] <White_Flame> yeah, gen4 is 2GB/sec
[05:08:44] <White_Flame> but yeah, lack of boot is annoying
[05:08:58] <hayley> Apparently the damn cache gets it up to 3.2GB/s, but when the cache fails it's only 900MB/s. Kinda shitty that the marketing gives you performance numbers for when you hit cache.
[05:09:30] <copec> gilberth I would say hardware limitation unless you want you make a new BIOS yourself
[05:10:00] <hayley> Otherwise, neat that you can get 500GB of that for AU$100 these days. But I can't just swap the boot drive apparently.
[05:10:02] <copec> but I'm making an assumption it doesn't have a bios update or you can chain boot to the drive
[05:10:19] <copec> *can't
[05:11:02] <hayley> Chain booting would be an interesting idea. Suppose GRUB knows how to do that, and I could remove the boot menu?
[05:11:21] <copec> yeah
[05:11:31] <hayley> I forgot the motherboard model, and idk how you check that from software.
[05:11:43] <copec> smbios
[05:11:52] <gilberth> copec: In the good old days a device would bring its own BIOS routines for in this case INT 13h, which is disk access.

[08:19:55] <hayley> Still no sign of how classes are actually held. Hm.
[08:23:06] <copec> What is the thread local behavior of sicl now?
[08:23:26] <hayley> There isn't any thread local behaviour so far, it is all hypothetical.
[08:23:41] <copec> ah
[08:25:25] <copec> what happens to say let bindings per thread if running sicl on sbcl?
[08:25:45] <hayley> We only run with one thread.
[08:26:34] <hayley> But the behaviour will be normal for CL: lexical variables are obviously thread-local, "global" special bindings are thread-global, and other bindings are thread-local.
[08:27:49] <hayley> All the hassle is about trying to make a fast GC, which we think should use thread-local nurseries. But that appears to be tricky when all objects are mutable.
[08:29:00] <copec> Do other threads have a handle on data in another's respective local nursery?
[08:29:33] <hayley> Nope, that's why they're thread-local.
[08:31:14] <copec> Next ignorant question: Can it then essentially act like each thread has it's own separate gc?
[08:34:01] <hayley> Only for nursery collections. But the global/major GC is concurrent and parallel, so w.r.t pause time it should "feel" entirely local.
[08:35:14] <copec> maybe try doing it with Rust instead?

[08:37:16] <hayley> Yes, atomic reference counting isn't concurrent or parallel. It'd be just like SBCL again!

[08:41:32] <gilberth> hayley: Are there any ideas to also have application-level nurseries?
[08:42:12] <hayley> gilberth: Not to my knowledge. But any thread groups would require stopping all the threads, which is a step down IMO.
[08:43:07] <gilberth> Say, you run some multi-threaded application which puts a lot of pressure on GC. Yet another also multi-threaded application, like say a web server, will not be affected by that at all.
[08:43:15] <hayley> One problem is that we don't have many concurrent applications to test (i.e. uses threads, more complex dataflow than lparallel).
[08:43:52] <gilberth> ok. Then, milady, we need forwarding pointers!
[08:44:18] <hayley> Hm, IMO you are fine as threads mostly pollute their own nurseries, and then the on-the-fly global heap, which doesn't do anything O(threads) or O(pressure) or whatever.
[08:45:26] <hayley> We considered forwarding pointers and even (less limited) reference counting, but the benefits are still unclear.
[08:45:42] <White_Flame> I think gilberth is talking about "regions"
[08:45:48] <White_Flame> in lispm speak
[08:46:00] <gilberth> Areas?
[08:46:13] <White_Flame> hmm, but even then, you might legitimately want a per-process heap/gc isolation without specifying its size
[08:46:27] <hayley> Unlikely, doesn't shit hit the fan if you misuse areas/regions?
[08:46:38] <White_Flame> yep
[08:46:43] <White_Flame> coarse-grained dealloc basically
[08:46:58] <White_Flame> assumes you have to references into it anymore
[08:47:00] * hayley gets another email about introductions to the new programming course, and it is literally the same as the last one.
[08:47:10] <White_Flame> but theoretically you could check on that, and assume it rare
[08:47:11] <lotuseater> good morning
[08:47:15] <gilberth> From reading the lispm documentation, I got the impression they were thought for kinda manual memory management. That is: Free an area in one go, no matter if that leads to dangling pointers.
[08:47:50] <White_Flame> *assumes you have NO references into it anymore [from above]
[08:47:58] <hayley> And recall it is a CLOS OS - I'd expect to fling references between applications.
[08:48:22] <White_Flame> is the SICL heap expected to be able to expand & contract?  I hate giving runtimes a fixed heap size
[08:49:10] <hayley> The only description of it is based off dlmalloc, which can expand (but idk about contracting).
[08:49:46] <hayley> Oh, and with persistence you could be very lazy and not close applications.

[11:46:02] <shka> both India and Pakistan are nuclear armed
[11:46:15] <gilberth> I am aware.
[11:47:35] <gilberth> And it's "good" that both are. Would be worse, if only one were. And don't forget Israel, when we talk about nuclear armed nations.

[11:55:48] <gilberth> From my point of view Israel is a bit paranoid. And when they would stop to behave like assholes, perhaps the neighbors would not pose so much a threat. Ooops, non-PC statement.

[12:20:10] <MichaelRaskin> Then again, from the firepower point of view Israel seems to be able to moonscape a large subset of the neighbours with conventional ammunition, so nuclear rumours might be serving more of a «considers as an option» than «has ability» role.

[18:05:15] <humasect> early times (late 90s?) java was aimed for on-chip
[18:05:35] <pl> technically the VM used is no longer called Dalvik, but the VM spec is the same, they are just on rewritten implementation
[18:05:36] <selwyn_> afaik porting abcl to android is a formidable problem
[18:05:58] <pl> selwyn_: it's more about making SBCL run as shared library
[18:06:23] <selwyn_> whatever happened to that proprietary cl implementation for the iphone? forget the name
[18:06:46] <humasect> mocl ?
[18:06:48] <pl> mocl
[18:06:49] <selwyn_> yes mocl
[18:06:54] <pl> it's still alive, but not many updates?
[18:06:59] <hayley> shka: But TLDR this is the setup for a plan where we optimistically guess we have a thread local heap, but if an assignment would make a pointer from global to local, we hand the heap to global GC and just use it as a thread local allocation buffer.
[18:07:06] <humasect> pl: ohh, that has not been done ?
[18:09:00] <pl> humasect: you mean SBCL as shared library? AFAIK only LispWorks and ECL provide that, maybe Allegro
[18:09:10] <pl> LW also happens to run on Android ;)
[18:13:49] * hayley is going to give Gil Tene a run for his money, except she won't charge for it
[18:14:40] <hayley> pl: 1v1 me challenge consing
[18:22:54] <humasect> pl: yeah =) how come you were saying it is needed for SBCL to be as library? guile can, and is one of its strong points.
[18:23:56] <pl> humasect: well, if you don't want possibly fragile hacks, you need to load SBCL from Java application, using Java's FFI
[18:24:13] <humasect> oh right
[18:24:31] <humasect> if CL is set in stone, why not make it a chip? 
[18:24:43] <humasect> some of us here seem to be doing FPGA and other hardware stuff
[18:25:04] <humasect> im not very good with hardware, wouldnt it be useful? if its a standard, burn it into hardware

[18:25:24] <humasect> =)
[18:25:44] <humasect> SBCL gets updates all the time though 
[18:25:50] <humasect> fix this, fix that
[18:27:04] <pl> humasect: and what would the representation of code used by said chip? :>
[18:28:02] <humasect> heh good point.
[18:28:08] <lotuseater> humasect: many things are let open to implementations
[18:28:12] <humasect> thats where CL is more like plato idealism =) 
[18:28:25] *** Joins: Alfr (~Alfr@user/alfr)
[18:28:25] <humasect> lotuseater: that is true. let's say, SBCL-on-chip =)
[18:28:32] <pl> humasect: the lisp machine chips provided instruction set and method of operation that was optimised for lisp
[18:28:36] <humasect> going off the java vibe
[18:28:38] <pl> they didn't interpret lisp directly
[18:29:01] <lotuseater> nah not SBCL
[18:29:01] <humasect> pl: basically the sbcl compiler does this now? that is, may as well use x86 or arm or whatnot.
[18:29:16] <pl> ... okay, maybe SCHEME chip was a bit more dedicated, but it also specified an instruction set
[18:29:22] <humasect> lotuseater: what other implementation?
[18:29:35] <pl> humasect: you can think of them as chips that had specific hardware accelerations for certain tasks
[18:29:39] <lotuseater> i meant free from it
[18:29:55] <humasect> pl: did not realise that. i was thinking a chip that eats lisp and spits out hmm instructions
[18:29:57] <pl> for example, all data in memory was typed
[18:30:01] <lotuseater> okay nothing can be perfect
[18:30:11] <humasect> lotuseater: so a general-purpose CPU? what are you, caveman? =)
[18:30:14] <pl> so you never had the issue of "ok, just what are those 4 bytes?"
[18:30:34] <humasect> stephen hawking "One of the basic rules of the universe is that nothing is perfect. Perfection simply doesn't exist... Without imperfection, neither you nor I would exist."
[18:31:06] <lotuseater> humasect: but not one of the ones from Plato's cave parable
[18:31:20] <lotuseater> right
[18:31:40] <lotuseater> and in chaos lies the beauty of it all
[18:31:42] <pl> another example of lisp-centered features on Ivory chip (and previous lisp machine) that are less talked about - hw support for forwarding pointers
[18:32:08] <humasect> i named my cat Plato etc 
[18:32:16] <humasect> lotuseater: eye of the storm is the calmes =)
[18:32:18] <humasect> calmest*
[18:32:24] <pl> this made copying GC much, much, much simpler
[18:32:29] <humasect> pl: oh?
[18:32:53] <humasect> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_ironing  
[18:33:18] <lotuseater> haha yes
[18:33:39] <lotuseater> or "extreme ironic"? ^^
[18:33:47] <pl> humasect: essentially, the hw support for forwarding pointers meant that a GC could do things like this: 1) Copy the object 2) place a forwarding pointer to new location in location of the old object 3) resume the program 4) update outdated references in background
[18:34:43] <pl> This is what Java's Shenandoah does too, afaik, but they have to emulate it by adding an extra pointer-sized field to all data on heap which has to be checked by code every time an object is accessed
[18:35:27] <humasect> pl: ohh nice. i'd have a VM just for that
[18:37:32] *** Quits: dave0 (~davezero@069.d.003.ncl.iprimus.net.au) (Quit: dave's not here)
[18:37:42] <pl> also, types in hw meant that you could emit code like "push <pointer to number>; push <pointer to number>; add;" and it would work so long as the numbers were, well, numbers (and worst case you'd get a system trap due to incompatible types)
[18:38:11] <pl> (all actually built Lisp Machines were stack-based, thus the example pushing to stack)
[18:40:58] <pl> also note that I put in pushing a pointer - because the CPU would automatically follow such pointer
[18:47:48] <humasect> sry was on phone. i like how genera has full memory
[18:48:05] <humasect> i think the word is, not "protected" memory 
[18:48:29] <humasect> "just code better" so apps dont hurt other apps. unless thats their purpose 
[18:49:23] <lotuseater> imagine you would still paying ~1$/CPU time per second or for a kilo of chars output :)

[18:51:06] <pl> just typed
[18:51:38] <humasect> lotuseater: hehe
[18:52:10] <lotuseater> right and that is not a weird idea at all
[18:52:45] <lotuseater> i saw one newer PhD about using even dependent typing for assembly level
[18:53:17] <humasect> types are fairly neat, ive learned to respect them through haskell and ocaml 
[18:54:52] <lotuseater> yes these polymorphic algebraic typing is more based on category theory. dependent typing goes even beyond it, a bit similar to OOP contracts which idea came from Eiffel
[18:58:38] <humasect> type inference is awesome. almost like it helps me think
[18:59:27] <humasect> not to get lazy in ways i used to be diligent, but, type inference/dependent types, are tools for exploration as well as tools for security/stability/sanity
[19:10:40] <pjb> Type inference is nice when the compiler indeed infers the types and doesn't require you to specify any type.  This is not the case of haskel.  This is the case of lisp.
[19:12:00] <shka> i see value of complex type systems for safety, but my software does not kill anyone when it malfunctions
[19:12:04] <shka> so...
[19:12:19] <humasect> pjb: ocaml is in between
[19:12:28] <pjb> Until it does. You never know what your software will be used for/on/with.
[19:12:37] <humasect> haskell needs types, ocaml can infer them. haskell doesn't have the 'inference' part so much.
[19:12:49] <humasect> heh
[19:12:52] <humasect> for war
[19:12:55] <shka> so you think that my classifier working on a counter-strike data can be used for evil? :D

[19:17:15] <humasect> ocaml and typescript and stuff can just infer *while* you type. so it takes a step closer than live-dev with REPL.
[19:19:33] <lotuseater> pjb: right, I can tell from my own experience. the GHC type inferencer is very good but sometimes it can't figure out all. and often you want explicitely declare types of functions or specific values to avoid too generic type class stuff. or using "newtype" vs "data" if your type has just one constructor with one field
[19:19:52] <lotuseater> but some cool techniques is for example phantom typing
