[11:59:34] <ionface> hi, what are those little smart cards embedded in fancy smart phones these days to act as a token vault or something? is it also doing the encryption/decryption math or is that on some different coprocessor?
[12:01:25] <riv> im not sure exactly what you're referring to
[12:01:59] <ionface> it's a more general term for what a smart card does
[12:02:20] <ionface> they've included them in smart phones for a few years apparently, just trying to find that term I can't remember to do more research on it
[12:02:24] <rqsd> I'm going to guess ionface is talking about the general, vague concept of what the SEP on iPhones does or various implementations of TrustZone on other vendors do
[12:02:33] <riv> some smartphones can communicate with nfc
[12:02:44] <rqsd> The tl;dr is, depends on the model
[12:02:54] <riv> some iphones have that secure enclave that stores key material and does calculations but is separate from the rest of the phone
[12:05:27] <ionface> definitely not NFC, does the secure enclave coprocessor have a descriptive acronym which other company's phones use?
[12:06:15] <riv> well it's only apple that has that
[12:07:03] <riv> > ARM’s TrustZone works very similarly to the Secure Enclave. It uses a secure area of the main processor to run critical software. Security keys can be stored here
[12:07:21] <ionface> ah, definitely not what I'm thinking of, but good to know

It'll probably require an attacker to have to take many more samples (perhaps multiple orders of magnitude more), but the randomness will have an "average delay" that you can subtract out

[23:13:24] <legend> and then send me the private key
[23:15:18] <maroon> not that i can, im assuming this is mime? just asking if it needs to be case-sensitive
[23:16:07] <legend> just all lowercase is fine
[23:16:21] *** Quits: peterhil (~peterhil@mobile-access-5672cd-211.dhcp.inet.fi) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[23:16:49] <maroon> i was asking because case-sensitive is harder to stumble across
[23:17:04] <legend> oh then, case sensitive aint needed
[23:17:14] <legend> could also be SHA256:lEgenD
[23:19:02] <maroon> so this is an rsa key? where the string would be mime(sha256(key)) ?
[23:19:25] <iz> if you use that as your private key though, there will always be someone on the internet that has your ssh key
[23:19:59] <maroon> but we trust us guys, right?
[23:20:44] <legend> no worries I trust y'all
[23:21:06] <legend> just need to impress a girl
[23:21:12] <maroon> for case-sensitive, each mime char is a 2^-6 chance, so length 6 would require searching average of 50% of 2^36 keys
[23:21:45] *** Joins: willyg_cos (~willyg_co@user/willyg-cos/x-4994202)
[23:23:12] <maroon> what's the average time needed to gen one of those keys...
[23:23:13] *** Joins: peterhil (~peterhil@mobile-access-5672cd-211.dhcp.inet.fi)
[23:23:51] <Soni> how do you make encryption where ciphertext diffs are small (so you can tell that two ciphertexts are *related*, if they share lineage), without running into ECB problems?
[23:23:54] <maroon> hint, there's fewer than 2^32 seconds in a year, so 2^36 would be 16 years
[23:24:01] <riv> legend: why don't you implement a brute force search for this?
[23:24:36] <maroon> is there a pubkey server out there that you could search for a key that already matches?
[23:25:01] <yawkat> Soni: i dont think you can achieve security with that requirement.
[23:25:13] <Soni> maroon: 2^32 seconds is about 140 years
[23:25:30] <maroon> search would be easier if it could be [1Ll][3eE][gG][3eE][nN][dD]
[23:26:07] <maroon> sorry you're right, i hit 365.25 but the decimal didn't register
[23:26:50] *** Parts: maroon (tinycrypt@user/maroon) ()
[23:27:11] <iz> and then after months of brute forcing you get 13g3Nd and wonder if anyone can even tell what that is suppose to be :b
[23:27:16] *** Joins: maroon (tinycrypt@user/maroon)
[23:27:41] <iz> and then after months of brute forcing you get 13g3Nd and wonder if anyone can even tell what that is suppose to be :b  [line repeated for maroon]
[23:27:42] <maroon> so for 2^35 keys at 1/sec would be 1088 years
[23:28:50] <legend> is it possible to manipulate the generator, to make it more proable to generate something like that
[23:29:27] <iz> no, that's the whole thing w/ cryptographic hashes.. you can't predict the hash value based on the input data
[23:29:28] <yawkat> probably not since the pattern is quite a bit downstream
[23:29:40] <maroon> if the string is hash of (key|| otherstuff) you'd be better off trying to brute force an edit of 'other stuff' instead of repeatedly generating keys
[23:29:53] *** Quits: qbt (~qbt@user/edun) (Quit: Leaving.)
[23:29:55] <Soni> yawkat: yes committing (symmetrically) encrypted files to git is fine and you can install merge/diff tooling to help with that but you don't wanna make github PRs completely unusable (even if there's an addon that makes it nicer) so how do you deal with that?
[23:29:58] <yawkat> you might be able to optimize some parts of the generation though, eg expensive primality checks
[23:30:24] <yawkat> Soni: copy what backup tools do in that case.
[23:30:54] <yawkat> or just... dont bother with incremental diffs
[23:31:07] <yawkat> this is not something git is good for
[23:31:21] <Soni> git is good at storing blobs
[23:31:35] <Soni> the rest is UI/UX
[23:32:21] <Soni> and git actually has pretty good UI/UX for binary/image/encrypted/etc diffs if you actually put some effort into using it (which everyone refuses to do because "ew creating diff/merge tooling" or w/e)
[23:33:32] <yawkat> Well clearly it does not have good ux for encrypted diffs since those are not a thing
[23:33:46] <maroon> if the 'otherstuff' of sha256(key||otherstuff) includes an RSA signature, that would really slow down any brute force

[23:35:37] <maroon> i tried finding a length-5 string anywhere within (not just beginning) a mime(2048-bit pubkey string) and even that was hard
[23:36:37] <yawkat> Fwiw, restics approach to incremental backups is probably as good as it gets in this area: https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.0/Design/
[23:37:23] <Soni> yawkat: it's the decrypt-then-diff approach
