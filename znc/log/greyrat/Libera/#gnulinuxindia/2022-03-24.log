[11:29:21] <AryaK> pstardust can ou move the gnulinuxindia website to codeberg pages
[11:29:32] <AryaK> also when does domain expire 
[11:30:20] <hehe> Are we just FOSS advocates or are we also against cetralisation ?
[11:30:25] <iamak[m]> pystardust: Yes ik I will do that
[11:30:48] <iamak[m]> To be frank, I prefer any kind of foss
[11:31:02] <hehe> iamak[m]: wdym ?
[11:31:04] <iamak[m]> I'm not like I only want decentralized foss etc
[11:31:14] <iamak[m]> Coz foss is much better than non foss
[11:31:31] <iamak[m]> Also I know I won't be able to self host in the near futureüòÇ
[11:32:06] <hehe> Libera is cetralised 
[11:32:30] <iamak[m]> But irc isn't
[11:32:34] <iamak[m]> Neither is matrix
[11:33:09] <iamak[m]> You can host own irc/matrix server instead of Libera if you prefer decentralizedüôÉ

[12:33:26] <pystardust> iamak[m]: it shows the edited message with * in front if it. It doesn't remove the old one
[12:44:13] <AryaK[m]> wait i will make a gnulinuxindia org
[12:45:47] <daksh[m]> what are you guys doing?
[12:46:38] <AryaK[m]> i want to migrate gnulinuxindia.org from pystardust's vps to codeberg pages
[12:47:00] <AryaK[m]> i have asked in codeberg's matrix room if i can use pages with orgs
[12:47:05] <AryaK[m]> lets see if they respond
[12:47:13] <daksh[m]> yes you can
[12:47:28] <daksh[m]> make a repo named pages
[12:47:33] <AryaK[m]> bruh
[12:47:39] <AryaK[m]> gnulinuxindia organization
[12:47:40] <AryaK[m]> not user
[12:47:59] <daksh[m]> yes
[12:48:08] <daksh[m]> iirc you can
[12:48:11] <daksh[m]> wait
[12:49:24] <pystardust> iamak[m]: in a sense irc is not decetralized. It could be but most networks are not sadly. They need to expicitly make a connection between irc servers, unline matrix/xmpp. I feel xmpp is the best way to go due to the ease of hosting but matrix is more popular
[12:49:57] <AryaK[m]> pystardust do you have a codeberg account?
[12:50:03] <pystardust> AryaK[m]: nope
[12:50:09] <AryaK[m]> rip
[12:51:23] <pystardust> Just a random opinions, I don't feel its a good thing to just make our own knowledge base, its better we contribute to something like tldp or archwiki
[12:51:32] <pystardust> opinion*
[12:53:05] <pystardust> but for random blog, its good to have a website. Also since if we want to do it as a organization we would need to review blogs before publishing and make it nice with a code of conduct and stuff like that
[12:53:41] <AryaK[m]> it does work
[12:54:13] <AryaK[m]> pystardust: i agree

[16:11:13] <AryaK[m]> but why rar
[16:16:20] <AryaK[m]> how do you decompress rar
[16:16:35] <Prit[m]> Also I would suggest not to use codeberg for the site, use some jamstack provider like vercel cloudflare pages etc which integrates with git repo.they integrate well with ssgs and have a low server response time unlike codeberg
[16:16:39] <Prit[m]> AryaK[m]: unrar
[16:16:54] <AryaK[m]> yeah but unrar put every single file in my Downloads dir

[16:20:00] <AryaK[m]> Prit: this is for me website
[16:20:06] <purpux> Is it a good idea to back up VMs ? Like the .qcow2 file and the xml ? Is it practical
[16:20:09] <purpux> ?
[16:20:58] <AryaK[m]> yes but highly compress them
[16:21:13] <AryaK[m]> i usually just copy the whole directory 
[16:21:17] <AryaK[m]> if i want to backup vms
[16:21:21] <purpux> AryaK[m]: I forgot about compression lmao
[16:21:24] <purpux> Yes, I'll do that
[16:21:25] <purpux> thanks
[16:21:50] <purpux> AryaK[m]: The whole directory as in the whole pool ?
[16:21:59] <AryaK[m]> pooL?
[16:22:37] <purpux> AryaK[m]: the place (folder,partition) where all the VM's .qcow2 files are stored
[16:22:58] <AryaK[m]> you are using vitr-manager right
[16:23:11] <AryaK[m]> just compress the whole of /var/lib//libvirt/images
[16:23:31] <purpux> AryaK[m]: yep, that's the default pool
[16:23:40] <AryaK[m]> yeah
[16:23:45] <AryaK[m]> there is another dir for xml file
[16:23:47] <AryaK[m]> so get that one too
[16:23:59] <purpux> AryaK[m]: Will do, thanks !
[16:24:25] <purpux> Just to confirm, that directory is ~/.config/libvirt right ? (I'm using a user session)
[16:25:45] <AryaK[m]> just see where the xml files are located

[17:26:38] <gtlsgamr> why codeberg?
[17:26:49] <gtlsgamr> and its a dead project dontya think?
[17:26:52] <gtlsgamr> no new articles and shit
[17:27:42] <AryaK[m]> i feel its dead because we cant contribute
[17:27:58] <AryaK[m]> because pystardust was the only one who had access and he was not there for a month
[17:28:13] <AryaK[m]> and why codeberg
[17:28:24] <AryaK[m]> codeberg is the most popular fully libre git hosting provider
[17:28:33] <gtlsgamr> cool. makes sense.
[17:28:37] <gtlsgamr> do it! 
[17:28:48] <AryaK[m]> gitlab is technically libre but the official instance uses gitlab Enterprise edition which is proprietary
[17:28:58] <AryaK[m]> only the community edition is foss

[18:38:09] <AryaK[m]> no 
[18:38:19] <AryaK[m]> basically the website repo has the hugo source
[18:38:26] <AryaK[m]> and pages repo has the built html
[18:41:54] <relejek[m]> yes i get it that 'pages' is submodule for 'website'
[18:42:10] <AryaK[m]> yeah
[18:42:15] <relejek[m]> so who will built 'pages' repo?
[18:42:27] <AryaK[m]> compile.sh will do that
[18:42:38] <AryaK[m]> you have to just git add modified files and then run compile.sh
[18:42:38] <relejek[m]> is it a CI
[18:42:43] <AryaK[m]> no ci
[18:42:47] <AryaK[m]> its built on your host
[18:42:52] <relejek[m]> or do we have to run it localy and push the changes accordingly?
[18:43:05] <AryaK[m]> compile.sh first commits your changes
[18:43:11] <AryaK[m]> builds the website
[18:43:25] <AryaK[m]> and then commits the built html 
[18:46:20] <relejek[m]> Arya K: we need a contribution.md file on how to work with this project for new people/whoever wishes to do their bit.
[18:46:46] <relejek[m]> figure out a step-by-step instruction if possible.
[18:46:50] <AryaK[m]> yeah 
[18:46:55] <AryaK[m]> basically 
[18:47:12] <AryaK[m]> you get website repo, do the modifications, run compile.sh and then submit pr

[23:11:37] <NeoVoid[m]> you see when you click on these nav bars you wouldnt redirect to different file instead to some section in same file (index.html)
[23:11:37] <NeoVoid[m]> so you dont create page.html blog.html photos.html
[23:11:37] <NeoVoid[m]> instead you create their respective contents in main index.html page and link navs to them
[23:12:43] <iamak[m]> I think if pages are small and don't have media, use your approach. Otherwise use the standard different page approach
[23:14:11] <NeoVoid[m]> iamak[m]: yes thats why i was asking
[23:14:11] <NeoVoid[m]> because some people creates bigger blogs
[23:14:46] <iamak[m]> Create a poll?

[23:17:13] <gtlsgamr> relejek: aryak-: are from linode vps?
[23:17:18] <gtlsgamr> who gave bouncer?
[23:17:47] <NeoVoid[m]> <gtlsgamr> "https://gitlab.com/gtlsgamr/..." <- i will study this one tommorow to see how can i use it for new site
[23:18:07] <gtlsgamr> okay.
[23:18:51] <NeoVoid[m]> gtlsgamr rss is just a xml file right which gets updated or we have to update it
[23:19:24] <gtlsgamr> it is xml file which should be updated when new content is added to a site
[23:19:36] <gtlsgamr> usually static site generators update it automatically
[23:19:38] <gtlsgamr> like mine!
[23:20:43] <iamak[m]> NeoVoid[m]: Ok
[23:20:58] <NeoVoid[m]> right so we have to update it manually with or without script
[23:21:33] <gtlsgamr> script does it automatically
[23:21:38] <iamak[m]> Tag me when creating the ssg. I'm interested
[23:21:40] <gtlsgamr> hugo does automatically
[23:21:57] <NeoVoid[m]> iamak[m]: we already have ssg gtlsgamr's ssg
[23:21:57] <NeoVoid[m]> we will use it
[23:22:22] <gtlsgamr> you might have to update manually if you are writing from scratch
[23:22:32] <NeoVoid[m]> gtlsgamr: hugo sounds like third party
[23:22:33] <NeoVoid[m]> bash scripts makes it feel like home
[23:23:42] <NeoVoid[m]> gtlsgamr: i like tweaking sites from scratch
[23:23:58] <NeoVoid[m]> this will help to learn
[23:24:40] <NeoVoid[m]> I learned somewhat of web designing from writing my own site
[23:26:18] <gtlsgamr> NeoVoid[m]: glad to know someone is interested.
[23:27:56] <NeoVoid[m]> i think people are interested it just lack of web dev knowledge intimidate them.
[23:28:05] <NeoVoid[m]> * people are always interested it
