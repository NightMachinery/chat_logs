[00:06:23] <fozzy> I have a cpan related question for namespaces, regarding an "alien::" package. can anyone advise me ?

[00:07:53] <fozzy> ok, the person asks: " I need to figure out how to create Alien::h3. I assume that's the correct namespace. I need it¬†so that CPAN testers can actually test
[00:07:53] <fozzy> > the Geo::H3::FFI package.¬† Currently, all tests are skipped unless find_lib actually finds the installed lib where as I think Alien::h3 would actually install the

What I'm proposing is ... figure out Alien so we build¬†Alien::h3, Alien::H3, or¬†Alien::libh3 (whatever is correct).¬† But, I'll need it will work under RPM (CentOS 7 and RedHat 7) as well as CPAN or I won't be a

[00:10:44] <plicease> With an FFI module it is trivial to use the Alien as a fallback dep, that is only install it if it isn't easily discoverable by FFI::CheckLib

[00:17:51] <sivoais> fozzy: Alien:: dists that use Alien::Base can have two kinds of installs, system and share. A system install happens when the dist is able to detect what is needed in the install environment.
[00:19:39] <sivoais> so if you have an RPM that installs libh3.so.1 in a standard search location, installing the Alien::H3 (or whatever it is called) will not build from source. Instead it will just gather the needed build/runtime parameters/files from the system.

[02:28:25] <vanfanel64> Having unicode identifiers (variable, sub, package, etc names) seems like a potential pandora's box
[02:28:33] <ilmari> aquanight: thats' what escape sequences are for (\N{...} or \u.... or whatever)
[02:28:38] <aquanight> it's probably not an easy problem to solve when your code rendering is simply highlighted text
[02:29:01] <vanfanel64> It can make things hard to read, or type out without copy pasting, such as when working with someone else's code
[02:29:01] <ilmari> aquanight: also why it's just a warning in rust (both bidi override and homoglyphs)
[02:29:06] <aquanight> ilmari: indeed. Really the idea of putting pre-encoded text in a source file is a bad idea in any situation.
[02:29:29] <aquanight> even with perl having 'use utf8;' I don't think I'd want to rely on it.
[02:29:40] <vanfanel64> Come to think of it, I have never really seen code with non-ascii identifiers
[02:29:42] <aquanight> you shouldn't be putting text literals in source. Put it in a .lang file and gettext() that shit.

[02:30:29] <aquanight> but as long as the rule of source code is simply "take your source octets as-is" compilers really don't have gorunds to complain
[02:30:31] <vanfanel64> For strings I use \x{...} or \N{unicode name}

[02:37:30] <aquanight> I vaguely remember once hearing it was actually possible (and even a good idea) in Windows to figure out how to set your codepage to a UTF-8 codepage and use -A APIs instead of the -W ones
[02:37:39] <aquanight> personally I don't by that
[02:37:41] <aquanight> buy that*
[02:37:59] <vanfanel64> First 128 characters are the same, after that are treated as utf-8 specific sequences
[02:38:01] <aquanight> NTKRNL at the lowest levels is all -W it can't possibly ever be better to use an -A API when you could use a -W one
[02:38:32] <vanfanel64> So it is 100% compatible with plain ascii just not extended ascii
[02:38:46] <aquanight> vanfanel64: I think partly that, but also partly because 00 is still NUL (so C-like NUL termination still worked) and any 8-clean transmission would not cause data loss even if the transport was not utf8 aware

[04:25:23] <Grinnz> to read from a filehandle, my $contents = do { local $/; readline $fh };
[04:26:00] <mst> PapaChub: because if you already have a filehandle File::Slurp is completely worthless?
[04:26:28] <Grinnz> there's a reason we managed to get this section in the docs https://metacpan.org/pod/File::Slurp#WARNING-PENDING-DOOM
[04:26:29] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ File::Slurp - Simple and Efficient Reading/Writing/Modifying of Complete Files - metacpan.org ]
[04:26:29] <PapaChub> It's for a library; I'm trying to be liberal in what I accept...
[04:26:34] <Grinnz> well, don't
[04:26:41] <xenu> this is a conservative channel
[04:26:46] <Grinnz> lol
[04:27:03] <Grinnz> but really, using the same api for handles as for file path is a footgun and there's a reason nothing modern does that
[04:27:04] <PapaChub> I thought Python was all about "There's Only One Way To Do It" ...  ;-P'
[04:27:05] <mst> PapaChub: using File::Slurp is being broken in what you accept and the opposite of your goal.
[04:27:21] <mst> PapaChub: there are many ways to do things in perl, yes. however, some of them are simply wrong :D
[04:27:56] <mst> PapaChub: also python claims to be about 'explicit is better than implicit' but it doesn't have 'my' or 'use strict' so they're liars anyway :P :D
[04:28:42] <Grinnz> if you have an existing api that already accepts that, test for a filehandle (more on that later) and readline it directly if so, otherwise use it as a file path with one of the slurp options
[04:29:13] <daemon> Grinnz, my $file = do { local $/; open(my $fh,'<',$file_path); my $slurp = <$file_path>; close($fh); $file_path }; # non encoding aware file slurp :)
[04:29:26] <Grinnz> what
[04:29:38] <daemon> oh wait PapaChub even sorry wrong nickname
[04:29:45] <Grinnz> also, no
[04:29:56] <daemon> <$fh> 
[04:30:09] <Grinnz> you returned the wrong variable, you read the wrong variable, and you didn't apply :raw or :encoding
[04:30:13] <mst> PapaChub: also, btw, if you're trying to accept a filename -and- a filehandle, because of encoding layers, you can't actually do that reliably, hence why the non-buggy File::Slurp replacements don't pretend to try
[04:30:15] <Grinnz> there's a reason modules were written to do this
[04:30:51] <Grinnz> right, if you want to read a file path, you have to decide what layers to apply
[04:30:52] <daemon> oh yeah should return $slurp whoops
[04:30:55] <mst> PapaChub: basically, you have to understand the difference otherwise you will write something buggy and possibly insecure, sorry
[04:31:00] <Grinnz> if you want to read a handle, you have to use whatever layers are on the handle already
[04:31:09] <Grinnz> this leads to blasted off feet
[04:32:15] <daemon> really depends on target, production use file::slurp something for messing about with your config files in /etc/ ... generally you do not need to be so fancy
[04:32:34] <Grinnz> File::Slurper, never File::Slurp
[04:32:59] <daemon> we really need a second cpan that has community validated modules
[04:33:17] <Grinnz> we've tried that several times
[04:33:47] <xenu> or Path::Tiny which gives you many other useful tools
[04:33:53] <Grinnz> ultimately the only way that actually works is "ask us what to use"
[04:33:55] <daemon> does not seem that difficult, just need to hand god powers of approval to a group of known responsible developers
[04:34:08] <Grinnz> "just need to invent time travel"
[04:34:16] <mst> we tried *that* but people having time to keep it up to date was hard
[04:34:17] <Grinnz> "just need to construct the universe"
[04:34:50] <mst> I keep considering turning the mstpan into an opinionated one
[04:34:51] <Grinnz> anyway we have https://metacpan.org/pod/Task::Kensho now which is still in need of some updates but i havent figured out how to add sections yet
[04:34:52] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ Task::Kensho - A Glimpse at an Enlightened Perl - metacpan.org ]
[04:35:09] <mst> right, kensho is my least failed attempt at this
[04:35:40] <mst> though in many ways the mstpan is more useful even if it's woefully incomplete
[04:35:47] <daemon> hmm could always do a 'hinted' version, putting into mind that there is not a 'good' version of everything
[04:36:18] <daemon> I actually do use file slurp, or did; did not even know about file slurper
[04:36:25] <daemon> there should be a way for that to be known
[04:36:40] <Grinnz> there's also https://metacpan.org/pod/Perl::Critic::Policy::Community::DiscouragedModules
[04:36:41] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ Perl::Critic::Policy::Community::DiscouragedModules - Various modules discouraged from use - meta... ]
[04:36:56] <daemon> needs to be delivered to the community though
[04:37:00] <Grinnz> daemon: pretty sure we mention that File::Slurp sucks at least once a day
[04:37:26] <Grinnz> there is no "the community"
[04:37:34] <Grinnz> there is this community, and the other communities
[04:37:44] <Grinnz> and the people who aren't in any community but use cpan

[04:37:54] <Grinnz> :P
[04:38:04] <Grinnz> it sucks *poorly*
[04:38:05] <daemon> so the answer would have to evolve around te central mirror

[04:38:30] <Grinnz> there is no "the answer"
[04:38:31] <daemon> or at least advising it
[04:38:48] <Grinnz> we reach who we can reach
[04:38:52] <xenu> is it just me or PapaChub's last line contains four replacement characters

[04:40:37] <PapaChub> Sorry.  Blame "XChat Azure.app", I suppose...  It was supposed to be an \N{EM DASH} and a pair of DOUBLE ANGLE QUOTATION MARKs
[04:41:00] <Grinnz> xchat hasnt been updated in years

[04:50:59] <gordonfish> I'm reminded of the fun I had many years ago when I tried irsii on cygwin from a cmd.exe window
[04:51:53] <Grinnz> yeah, it's great that irc relies on clients using an encoding that other clients will expect
[04:52:04] <Grinnz> and doesn't care as long as it's an ascii superset

[04:53:26] <PapaChub> Yeah, I do see a pretty anemic "Character Chart" window...  And pasting in a \N{U+000AB} gives me: ¬¨¬¥.  Barf!  ü§Æ
[04:54:01] <xenu> in 2021 it's reasonable to consider non-utf8 irc clients broken
[04:54:52] <Grinnz> there's a lot of irc clients that could be considered broken for various reasons
[04:55:14] <mst> PapaChub: your <<thing>> displayed fine here in my irssi
[04:55:33] <mst> PapaChub: but irssi is an ancient bastard text based thing that tries to survive the world of hurt that is the internet ;)
[04:55:38] <xenu> btw ircv3 has 'utf8only' flag which indicates that the server requires utf-8
[04:55:50] <xenu> and it will reject non-utf8 messages
[04:56:26] <gordonfish> Sounds brutal but effective
[04:56:29] <Grinnz> i would also consider your irc clients that don't have a utf-8 fallback cp1252 decode as broken, in practice
[04:56:45] <Grinnz> though i'm surprised irccloud does have the fallback tbh
[04:57:03] <xenu> cp1252 fallback makes sense only for a handful of western languages
[04:57:18] <Grinnz> it makes sense for 99% of irc use
[04:57:26] <Grinnz> because thats what mirc did, basically
[04:57:59] <gordonfish> Wait, is cp1252 in common use outside of Windows (other than for reading things that came from a Windows machine) ?
[04:58:01] <xenu> i'm pretty sure mirc used system codepage, which happened to be 1252 in english windows
[04:58:05] <ilmari_> it's configurable in the matrix IRC bridge, but only enabled on IRCNet, AFAIK

[04:59:46] <gordonfish> ilmari_: Right, though it doesn't seem all that common in linux or macos
[04:59:51] <Grinnz> gordonfish: linux had iso-8859-1 or similar as default charsets before utf-8 took over
[04:59:59] <Grinnz> it just moved to utf-8 much faster than windows
[05:00:02] <gordonfish> Exactly
[05:00:04] <xenu> PapaChub_: it looks ok
[05:00:26] <ilmari_> IIRC HTML 5 says any declaration of ISO-8859-1 should be interpreted as cp1252

[05:02:19] <Grinnz> gordonfish: in the style of perl doing what works in production, not what has a perfect design
[05:02:59] <Grinnz> PapaChub: right because irssi has the cp1252 fallback so it understands xchat, and xchat probably understands utf-8 coming in
[05:03:01] <pj> If I highlight I can see the crap
[05:03:10] <xenu> i'm using irssi and there's no fallback
[05:03:19] <Grinnz> maybe yours is broken

[05:03:28] <gordonfish> Adura*

[19:08:10] *** vigumnov is now known as victori
[19:11:59] <hethw> why most file/dir functions are not utf8 transparent?
[19:13:17] <haj1> What do you mean with "transparent"?
[19:13:28] <mjgardner> hethw: Because encoding is hard and Perl is old.
[19:14:07] <haj1> Also, because storage devices can be old and have file names in various pre-UTF8 encodings
[19:14:09] <hethw> haj1, I want to pass a string and not care if the function want bytes or utf8, that should be handled in the function
[19:14:11] <Grinnz> operating systems don't even agree that files and dirs should be utf8
[19:14:25] <Grinnz> that's not possible
[19:14:31] <hethw> of course it is
[19:14:42] <Grinnz> and i assume you meant "bytes or characters", because utf8 are bytes
[19:15:09] <hethw> whatever you prefer to call them
[19:15:37] <Grinnz> it's not a preference
[19:16:01] <hethw> like readdir could take both bytes and utf8 and when talking to the filesystem should pick whatever is needed
[19:16:11] <tm604> ideally there'd be a nice simple abstraction that takes strings and does the assume-it's-UTF-8-or-apply-weird-heuristics for you
[19:16:12] <hethw> and pass it
[19:16:13] <Grinnz> characters and the utf-8 bytes representing those codepoints are two separate strings
[19:16:25] <Grinnz> again, utf8 are bytes
[19:16:45] <Grinnz> but yes, ideally perl would let you mark a string as characters or bytes, but that doesn't exist currently, so it's not possible
[19:17:04] <hethw> well there is the utf8 flag
[19:17:12] <Grinnz> that doesn't indicate the contents of the string
[19:17:18] <hethw> yes
[19:17:19] <Grinnz> that indicates how it's stored
[19:17:26] <Grinnz> it's not possible to reuse for that purpose
[19:17:37] <Grinnz> and it will cause bugs if you try
[19:18:33] <hethw> it would be useful if functions had 'utf8' support marked in the docs or the lack thereof
[19:18:46] <hethw> now it's just gamble
[19:18:54] <hethw> </rant>
[19:19:06] <Grinnz> utf8 would be misleading for the same reasons you're misusing it, but yes, functions should document whether they take characters or bytes
[19:19:35] <Grinnz> and several builtins like opendir are broken, Sys::Binmode fixes them to take only bytes
[19:19:39] <LeoNerd> OSes don't tell you encodings of bytes for filenames. Annoyingly. Any OS-level function that operates on filenames just operates on opaque bytes, and it's up to programs to attempt to do the right things
[19:19:47] <LeoNerd> If the concept of "right things" is even well-defined
[19:19:49] <LeoNerd> I'm not sure that it is
[19:21:03] <hethw> well at least they are consistent in taking bytes
[19:21:06] *** Joins: rindolf (~shlomif@2a0d:6fc2:4bb1:500:6b1e:2524:3d70:36ec)
[19:21:43] <LeoNerd> Er.. what else would they operate on?
[19:21:55] <tm604> Unicode strings?
[19:22:01] <tm604> like print with an I/O layer
[19:22:03] <LeoNerd> I mean at the syscall level
[19:22:25] <LeoNerd> At the "lets stick some numbers in some registers and invoke SYSCALL" level of Linux, there is only bytes
[19:22:32] <tm604> syscall is typically several layers below what a Perl programmer should be concerned with
[19:22:36] <LeoNerd> And Linux doesn't really give any extra meaning to those bytes
[19:22:48] <LeoNerd> Right. but my point is nothing anywhere ever explains what extra meaning those bytes might have either
[19:23:25] <LeoNerd> A wellbehaved polite program probably ought to stick to only sending valid UTF-8 encoded bytes when /calling/ the OS, but there's no guarantee that the OS will only give you UTF-8 bytes back.. e.g. when calling readdir() or readline()
[19:23:27] <LeoNerd> readlink()
[19:23:29] <tm604> Perl is usually quite good at working around the deficiencies of official specifications
[19:24:08] <tm604> so yes, POSIX may not define path encodings, but other platforms _do_ - Windows for example - and having Perl make that easier to work with would save some time and effort
[19:24:42] <tm604> plus we already have `binmode` for telling Perl about file handle encoding, why can't we have an equivalent for telling it what the filesystem expects?
[19:25:06] <LeoNerd> Wouldn't that would have to be global? It couldn't apply per handle
[19:25:12] <LeoNerd> because there are no handles
[19:25:27] <LeoNerd> Well hmm.. I suppose readdir has a handle
[19:25:42] <tm604> Sure. Same as `binmode STDOUT` is global.
[19:25:55] <LeoNerd> Mmm.. it's global but specific to that one handle
[19:26:21] <tm604> yes - but why does that matter?
[19:26:44] <LeoNerd> It's the whole "action at a distance" problem
[19:27:09] <tm604> technically different components in a path could have different encodings, so the concept in the underlying implementation is extremely flawed - but having ways of saying "yes I'm on an entirely-UTF-8 filesystem" without having to call encode() for _every_ path-taking call does not seem unreasonable
[19:27:12] <LeoNerd> I could imagine some lexically scoped pragma that told perl "OS calls operating within this scope should be UTF-8 (en/de)coded"
[19:27:43] <LeoNerd> Actually I'm now suddenly surprised there isn't a bit in  -C  for it already
[19:27:58] <tm604> indeed
[19:28:13] <tm604> but I think the built-in features are a lost cause already - a CPAN module like Path::Tiny would be more realistic
[19:28:23] <LeoNerd> Perhasps someone can pre-RFC it?
[19:28:40] <LeoNerd> This feels like it's verymuch in fgasper's ballpark
[19:33:40] <pragma-> Somebody new to Perl, or trying to get into Perl, is going to try the built-in features first, because they'll assume that core functions are well-maintained. They aren't going to know to look for Path::Tiny or even what Path::Tiny is named.

[19:35:02] <tm604> sounds like they're going to have a bad time then

[19:36:36] <LeoNerd> Adding a new lexically-scoped bit to change behaviour sounds fine though
[19:36:49] <LeoNerd> It can't be back-incompatible at that point
