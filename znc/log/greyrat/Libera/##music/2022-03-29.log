[07:27:57] <artao> efex_ black body radiation is apparently an example of a photon cloud
[07:28:16] <artao> it exerts pressure on its surroundings
[07:28:30] <artao> how do you prepare for a show?
[07:28:34] <artao> i wanna do some shows 
[07:28:43] <artao> still working out my setup too tho
[07:29:16] <artao> Someone write me a granular delay for my Korg NuTekt NTS-1
[07:29:20] <artao> heh heh
[07:29:29] <artao> me do it? um .... C++
[07:29:30] <artao> so no
[07:29:32] <artao> not possible
[07:31:56] <artao> also a "glitcher"
[07:33:11] <artao> Dear Korg: Pleae make a visual programmer for the *logue system (with which the NTS-1 is mostly compatible. tho some stuff made for the prologue/monologue can't run cuz the NTS-1 is less powerful
[07:34:01] <artao> if we could just export a reaktor patch as a *logue plugin, that'd be great mkay
[07:34:24] <artao> Yeah. I'm gonna need you to come in this weekend and program that up quick mkay.
[07:34:26] <artao> thanks
[07:34:45] <sdragon> Visual programming, like Scratch?
[07:35:22] <artao> nvr heard of it
[07:35:25] <artao> like Reaktor
[07:35:37] <artao> or Max/SMP
[07:35:47] <artao> PureDate. Supercollider
[07:36:07] <artao> it might make more sense for one of those to have output to the *logue format

[08:06:38] <efex_> next.. I practiced a lot!! gaaaaah
[08:06:45] <louipc> prepare for a show by being unprepared and having it be a huge disaster, then preparing better next time
[08:07:00] <efex_> hah nope
[08:07:12] <efex_> this was make it or break it
[08:07:23] <sdragon> Okay, back

[08:10:25] <efex_> what sort
[08:10:46] <louipc> didnt bring a mic, or whatever
[08:11:25] <efex_> this was the third time these organizersd asked me to perform.. covid happened.. I wanted to do it with my duo partner as I was a coward about doing a solo show
[08:11:38] <efex_> right
[08:11:40] <louipc> kool
[08:12:14] <efex_> I had to show up, set up my magnetic piano system, and hope it all worked
[08:12:22] <efex_> yay it did
[08:12:38] <efex_> lolphew
[08:13:01] <efex_> they had techs for everything else
[08:15:48] <efex_> the venue was amazing but when I first went in to see it it was intimidating too
[08:31:44] <artao> if i did a show it probably wouldn't be "songs," but rather a 30 to 60 min improv on my synths. With some pre-set up stuff most likely of course.
[08:32:01] <artao> Fucking MIDI. Why isn't program change just another CC#

[08:38:05] <artao> yarrr matey
[08:40:52] <efex_> artao:  I had a lot of improvised aprts but they were for three pieces from my spectrum piano album
[08:41:38] <efex_> CC for a program change would be fine
[08:42:25] <efex_> you could probably build a transformer in reaktor co convert CC’s tho imho
[08:42:43] <efex_> if as you said you used reaktor
[08:43:28] <artao> FUCK i just went in to pour the water for my coffee only to discover that i didn't turn on the burner
[08:43:30] <artao> D'OH
[08:47:11] <efex_> artao you could make an external object in Max as well to convert the CC’s too… I am not a max dude tho
[08:47:31] <efex_> just an idea
[08:51:33] <artao> i'm not either. never touched it
[08:51:40] <artao> just reaktor really
[08:51:55] <artao> i had puredata and supercollider installed for awhile but never used either
[08:51:59] <artao> just Reaktor
[08:52:02] <efex_> reaktor I soend some time with, I could build basic synths and stuff
[08:52:08] <artao> which SERIOUSLY is in need of a major update
[08:52:25] <efex_> PD was Max without the GUI I recall
[08:52:29] <artao> i'm half afraid that NI is just gonna drop Reaktor. but that would be 200% idiotic
[08:52:42] <efex_> supercollidr looked great but I never touched it
[08:53:02] <efex_> reaktor gets added to lots
[08:53:05] <artao> it's powerful. i know that much
[08:53:12] <efex_> they just added the blocks after all
[08:53:20] <artao> several years ago
[08:53:30] <artao> the GUI is fucking awful tho
[08:53:39] <efex_> their Eurorack reaktor model
[08:53:44] <efex_> YES
[08:53:49] <efex_> kontakt too
[08:53:53] <artao> i'm sure people with 4K screens can't even use the deeper levels of it. Just the Ensembles
[08:54:00] <efex_> the fonts are all teeeny weeny
[08:54:04] <artao> eurorack isn't NI
[08:54:18] <artao> his tongue is right on the tip of my name
[08:54:19] <artao> fak
[08:54:25] <efex_> well change you screen res to make everyting bigger, done
[08:54:27] <artao> anyhow, he's also made them for VCV Rack
[08:54:37] <artao> some free but $ for full set
[08:54:42] <efex_> eurrack is a standard
[08:54:56] <efex_> yoiu must know
[08:55:03] <artao> yeah. i misread
[08:55:15] <artao> someone made a set of blocks called euroreact IIRC
[08:55:23] <efex_> the blocks reaktor thing is made to look like a eurorck system
[08:55:36] <efex_> could be dunno
[08:55:38] <sdragon> I looked on Reverb, and I could easily spend $4k on eurorack stuff
[08:55:39] <artao> i wish my audio interface could integrate with modular gear. but it has that LF filter
[08:55:46] <artao> i didn't know about that stuff when i bought it
[08:55:58] <efex_> the blocks over all are a model of a euro setup
[08:56:16] <artao> the newer racks seems nice too, tho 've not yet really used it
[08:56:20] <efex_> get a used motu interface, they all pass dc
[08:56:34] <artao> good to know
[08:56:45] <efex_> a firewire run still works fine if you have thunderbolt
[08:57:06] <efex_> err One
[08:57:12] <artao> part of why i went with the neutron first is cuz it's essentially one full eurorack "voice"
[08:57:13] <efex_> firewire one
[08:57:41] <efex_> I have some eurorack I sort of accumulated
[08:57:44] <sdragon> Neutron at the center, plus Plaits, Marbles, Maths, Magneto, and I'm halfway there
[08:57:49] <artao> and now with the rest of the gear I have I can focus on getting utility modules and other weirder stuff rather than the basics
[08:57:57] <artao> Maths for instance
[08:58:08] <sdragon> artao: that's why I want a Neutron, too
[08:58:09] <efex_> but I think patchable semi-modulars rule
[08:58:21] <artao> attenuverters. mults. summers. mixers. LFOs. envelope generators ...
[08:58:46] <efex_> maths! U had one a week then the guy I bought it from begged tobuy it back eheheh

[09:12:28] <artao> electronic. influenced by techno, electro, acid trance, experimental .....
[09:12:56] <artao> bandcamp is more "finished music" while soundcloud is more live improvs
[09:14:03] <artao> i need to upload more finished music. i've got an album of sorts. a collection of almost all music made between 2020 and 2023
[09:14:18] <artao> er ... 2019 - 2023

[09:16:45] <efex_> I have been totally lazy since I performed
[09:16:56] <efex_> slacker
[09:17:02] <efex_> lazeeee
[09:17:33] <artao> its' the whole "rather make new stuff than work on old stuff" problem
[09:18:20] <efex_> I have a whole bunch of tracks needing mnore work but I am usally ok there
[09:19:09] <efex_> I never even walked into my studio for three months
[09:19:25] <efex_> can’t even rememeber the track names LOL
[09:21:42] <artao> i don't name them until very late
[09:22:09] <artao> and it's pretty random. i keep a list of "words" and phrases that i just go thru until one strikes me as appropriate
[09:23:07] <artao> "words" like mordicus. pestodemus. lukovaccia. spassilator. swazefistron
[09:23:24] <efex_> lol me too
[09:23:33] <efex_> I totally suck at names
[09:23:42] <artao> or more "sensible" stuff like sex tax, ontological psychotronics, baryon acoustic oscillations. magnetar ...
[09:24:04] <artao> Onanistic Octagon
[09:24:04] <efex_> that works: not the route I have taken but fine
[09:24:30] <artao>  i just in general kinda like making up words
[09:24:36] <artao> cuz ultimately all words are made up
[09:24:56] <artao> mind kampf
[09:25:06] <artao> that's kinda dumb. eh? no? yes?
[09:25:13] <artao> it's "clever"
[09:25:19] <artao> and "clever" is lame
[09:25:21] <artao> :\
[09:25:25] <artao> yeah. delete
[09:25:42] <sdragon> efex: I do somewhat experimental electronic music, mostly, at the moment
[09:25:58] <efex_> ‘they do reference local versions of universal ideas tho
[09:26:00] <sdragon> Or soundtrack-y sounding stuff
[09:26:09] <efex_> sdragon: cool
[09:26:14] <efex_> also
[09:26:50] <efex_> I am working on an album, but have one album done… that’s abou it as far as albums
[09:27:18] <artao> hmm. should i superglue my Krusty the Clown LEGO to my mixer?
[09:27:27] <artao> or maybe minilab or keystep pro

[09:35:43] <artao> i don't wanna upload my shit with just a still image
[09:35:54] <artao> but FAK music videos take awhile to make
[09:35:57] <efex_> artao I skimmed throiugh some tracks and know you intend them to be heatrd full length.. 20 minutes
[09:35:59] <artao> and it's tedious work sometimes
[09:36:12] <artao> ah
[09:36:15] <sdragon> I shared my Spotify page with a friend of mine that's non-binary
[09:36:17] <artao> in the Long Form section?
[09:36:26] <artao> that stuff is all pretty old honestly
[09:36:37] <artao> at least 3-4 yrs
[09:36:49] <sdragon> Somehow, Spotify knew they're non-binary, and it was included in the viewer stats
[09:36:56] <efex_> aha yeah a 60 minute track…a ll good but needs time to hear is all
[09:37:07] <artao> rather
[09:37:18] <artao> it's "listening music" to be sure
[09:37:28] <artao> on in the background while doing other stuff perhaps
[09:37:33] <artao> at the gym
[09:37:34] <sdragon> Now, the algorithm is recommending my stuff to more people who are non-binary
[09:37:36] <sdragon> Hahahaha
[09:37:56] <artao> i've often been told it'd make good soundtrack work for games and movies
[09:38:28] <artao> sdragon you're on spotify? :O
[09:38:50] <artao> via whom? which is to say, which service are you using?

[09:39:11] <artao> i'm considering signing up on distrokid
[09:39:20] <sdragon> I use DistroKid
[09:39:33] <artao> but if you stop paying them regularly they take your shit down
[09:40:03] <sdragon> Unless you buy the Leave a Legacy add-on
[09:40:04] <artao> OTOH they're pretty much the most inexpensive option
[09:40:13] <artao> OH right. i forgot about that
[09:40:19] <artao> which can be per-track right?
[09:40:27] <artao> but a bit costly
[09:40:30] <sdragon> But I don't plan on stopping paying them any time soon, anyway
[09:40:40] <sdragon> That's correct, yeah
[09:41:28] <efex_> mmm
[09:42:11] <artao> i honestly don't really use spotify
[09:42:33] <artao> or pandora or any other of those. when  listen to music it's generally on youtube. maybe soundcloud, or possibly bandcamp
[09:42:52] <artao> chill track sdragon :)
[09:43:08] <sdragon> artao: Thanks. Which one?
[09:43:12] <artao> iZotope Vinyl plugin?
[09:43:15] <artao> the one you linked
[09:43:25] <artao> Popular
[09:43:28] <artao> no
[09:43:28] <efex_> I hate the management of spotify

[09:43:33] <artao> Underwater Dreams
[09:43:40] <sdragon> Oh, okay hahahaha
[09:43:45] <artao> me too efex_ .. me too
[09:43:53] <artao> the streaming model as-it-is sucks balls
[09:43:59] <sdragon> Yeah, that's on the album I released last year
[09:44:08] <artao> the dinosaur music industry managed to dig their way back in
[09:44:26] <efex_> yeah that guys sucks…bad eniughi to underpay but then invest in AI weapons?
[09:44:29] <artao> do you make any relevant income from spotify etc sdragon?
[09:44:30] <sdragon> And no, not iZotope, but I think it's really cool that you thought that!
[09:44:39] <artao> or is it just like a few cents here and there now and then
[09:44:53] <artao> i heart their Vinyl plugin
[09:45:09] <artao> i made an entire track using just that as the sound source ..... then run it thru several fx chains
[09:45:25] <sdragon> Few bucks a month, if you have any clue how to put your music in front of people
[09:45:48] <artao> i've been experimenting with that sort of thing a bunch. just using a single simple sound source and then "playing" the effects to transform it into something totally unexpected
[09:45:57] <artao> righto. coo
[09:45:59] <artao> l
[09:46:07] <artao> i suck at and strongly dislike doing promotion
[09:46:17] <artao> :\
[09:46:19] <efex_> ditto
[09:46:32] <artao> it kinda makes me feel guilty and narcissistic
[09:46:33] <sdragon> If you're consistent, know what you're doing, and have a strong work ethic, you could probably make a humble living off of it
[09:46:50] <artao> :D
[09:47:58] <efex_> I have made a iving at music
[09:48:04] <sdragon> Unfortunately, none of those three apply to me hahahahaha
[09:48:05] <efex_> Living
[09:48:20] <artao> i've made money as a busker
[09:48:32] <artao> i guess that's "a living" when your homeless
[09:48:40] <artao> not so much with an apartment
[09:48:45] <sdragon> I've made a couple bucks busking, too
[09:49:08] <sdragon> I'm thinking of busking with my banjo some time this year
[09:49:14] <artao> when i was homeless it'd take a couple hours to make 20 to 50 bucks then i'd stop
[09:49:17] <artao> just make enuf for the day
[09:49:22] <efex_> I did some tv\
[09:49:33] <efex_> in canada..not much now
[09:49:42] <artao> cool
[09:49:44] <sdragon> I figure the banjo might grab more attention than a guitar
[09:49:48] <artao> *canadadia
[09:49:51] <artao> heh heh heh
[09:49:54] * artao is clearly evil
[09:50:06] <artao> i'd happily move to Vancouver
[09:50:17] <DunceCotus> Banjo Kazooitar
[09:50:43] <efex_> I in fact moved to vancouver for work
[09:50:49] <artao> nice
[09:51:10] <artao> circa 2000 i SUPER wanted to go to the film school in vancouver
[09:51:19] <artao> study cgi fx and animation
[09:51:24] <artao> $$$$$$
[09:52:04] <sdragon> I think circa 2000 I wanted to be a pro wrestler
[09:52:04] <efex_> VFX
[09:52:37] <efex_> the Art Institute is there as well
[09:53:13] <artao> circa 1990 i wanted to (and could have gotten in) the art institute of chicago
[09:53:17] <artao> but again, $$$$$
[09:53:25] <artao> like 20k/yr just for tuition
[09:53:27] <artao> in 1990
[09:53:30] <efex_> cool
[09:53:35] <artao> not including living and eating and such
[09:53:47] <efex_> we are both ancient, that is fun
[09:53:54] <artao> i did a portfolio review tho and was told i'd have no problem getting in
[09:54:03] <artao> <sigh> in some parallel universe that happened
[09:54:18] <artao> what a TOTALLY  different life that would have been
[09:56:09] <artao> 2 more air-to-air kills in IL-2 Flying Circus and I'll be an ace \o/
[09:56:22] <artao> them ww1 planes are quite something to fly
[09:56:46] <efex_> I taught myself the midi and digital audio stuff but I had music training
[09:56:46] <artao> in a mission yesterday the winds and turbulance was just tossing the plane around like a toy almost
[09:57:57] <artao> and certain turning maneuvers seem better accomplished with the rudder rather than aileron. took some getting used to for sure
[09:58:07] <artao> and SUPER easy to get into an unrecoverable spin
[09:58:17] <artao> efex_ yeah i'm self taught too
[09:58:22] <artao> autodidact
[09:58:55] <efex_> I a selftaught in tech but not in music
[09:59:30] <artao> i was taught trumpet and how to read music but self taught the rest of my instruments and music theory
[09:59:56] <efex_> I have two music degrees.
[10:00:02] <artao> nice!
[10:00:04] <artao> in what?
[10:00:37] <efex_> the first is a BMus is orchestral percussion performance
[10:00:47] <efex_> the second.. a weird one
[10:01:34] <efex_> a Master of Fine Arts in interdisciplinary arts. My focus  was music composition for acoustic piano
[10:01:46] <efex_>  but as art no music so rt of
[10:01:47] <artao> nice
[10:02:12] <efex_> it was great
[10:02:31] <artao> i had one year of college. kinda
[10:02:38] <efex_> Iwanted to really look at harmony and melody after a lifeetime of timbre
[10:02:48] <efex_> hey shit happens

[10:06:32] <artao> that's reasonable
[10:07:31] <artao> on the plus side re: getting kick out of college. the 2nd semester was thrown out, so only 1 semester of GPA
[10:07:45] <artao> which is good cuz i had like 0.6 GPA at the time LOL
[10:08:19] <artao> i pretty much just hung out in the art building for the most part. never went to any classes. ..... not even some of the art classes, like 2D design. cuz it was dull and i was learning nothing
[10:08:28] <artao> but required for a degree
