[04:52:47] <Oleg> it's interesting that both French and English have the word "amour", but in French, it means "love", and in English, it means a "love affair".

[05:13:10] <kurahaupo> Oleg: I don't particularly like99,99 it in any case, it just seems less wrong. But adding the modifying relative clause makes it go wrong again. I'm not sure why but I suspect it's because "I'm not that type of a girl" works precisely because "that type" is deliberately left unspecified as a social convention.

[05:16:58] <kurahaupo> eqw: it prompts me to ask "which windscreen" 
[05:17:34] <kurahaupo> eqw: better with "its" inserted
[05:18:07] <Oleg> kurahaupo: "who indulges in these things" is a modifying relative clause?
[05:18:32] <eqw> is there more then one windscreen in cars? Or 'its' have to be anyway?
[05:18:33] <kurahaupo> eqw: But I would tend to say simply "The car's windscreen was missing"
[05:18:38] <kurahaupo> Oleg: yes
[05:19:04] <kurahaupo> Or "The car had no windscreen"
[05:22:45] <Oleg> kurahaupo: but, as I said many times before, I can't find a specific grammar rule that explains why omitting the indefinite article in cases such as this one would be correct.
[05:26:26] <kurahaupo> Oleg: "girl" in "that type of girl" is a category rather than a reference to any individual. The rules for articles are different for categories; "I'm not just some guy" ← "some" normally only works as a plural indefinite article, or with an uncountable noun.
[05:28:47] <kurahaupo> There's some tricky nuance in our using the same word as both a reference to one or more individuals, and to refer to a mass or category.
[05:30:37] <kurahaupo> The surprising thing is that the article is sometimes allowed99,99, as in "I'm not that kind of a boy"
[05:32:19] <kurahaupo> My suspicion is that it's two completely different derivations arriving at two phases that seem equivalent and yet differ by one word.

[05:34:23] <Oleg> kurahaupo: there is no article that precedes "bed" in the sentence "I went to bed" because "bed" in this case is not a concrete bed, but a category?
[05:34:58] <kurahaupo> That sounds reasonable yes
[05:37:21] <kurahaupo> In archaic English we might have said "I went abed"; that a+ to mean "in the direction of" still persists in some nautical terms such as aboard, ashore, astern

[05:41:04] <kurahaupo> So I suspect that evolving from "athing" 99,99to "to thing99,99" is why we omit articles, and finding a consistent rule to explain it is basically an exercise in reverse engineering
[05:44:17] <Oleg> kurahaupo: I think books on English grammar don't spend enough time talking about this abstract vs. concrete thing
[05:46:37] <kurahaupo> Even as a native speaker it's not a distinction we spent a lot of time discussing in school, so the terminology will be idiosyncratic, as each person tries to explain it in their own words

[07:50:02] <Voxel> Hey all ^^
[07:50:15] <Voxel> So, here's a yet another question.

[08:03:53] <ksft> Voxel: where?
[08:04:50] <Voxel> No question for you. Nevermind.
[08:05:09] <Voxel> I'm just kidding ^^
[08:05:30] <Voxel> I was going to ask a question, but tried searching one more time and found relevant information
[08:05:36] <Voxel> I'm sorry ^^
[08:06:30] <Voxel> The question was "Why would they call a body part Uranus. Is it related to the god Ouranos and the Planet"
[08:06:59] <Voxel> Found these:
[08:07:00] <Voxel> https://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question42.html
[08:07:06] <Voxel> https://www.astrologyweekly.com/forum/archive/index.php/t-553.html
[08:07:35] <Voxel> Yet the body part is questionable

[08:35:56] <pussipupu> Who calls a body part "Uranus"?
[08:38:02] <TechTest> what body part is that?
[08:38:05] <CuriosTiger> It's a pun on "your anus".
[08:38:20] <CuriosTiger> English-speaking children find no end of amusement in that coincidence.
[08:39:03] <pussipupu> I'm assuming the questioner isn't an eight-year old child in the playground though
[08:39:25] <pussipupu> Maybe an unreasonable assumption
[08:39:28] <CuriosTiger> No, but you can't be sure he's not an eight-year-old child on IRC.
[08:39:59] <CuriosTiger> *I* didn't assume that the pun would be immediately apparent to non-native speakers, particularly in written form. Which is why I explained what might seem obvious.
[08:40:05] <CuriosTiger> (Also, you did ask.)
[08:40:36] *** Joins: DevAntoine (~DevAntoin@78.196.234.32)
[08:41:09] <pussipupu> Fair enough, though I was specifically meaning to ask Voxel as they were the the one claiming someone was
[08:44:15] <CuriosTiger> Ah. :)
[08:45:32] *** Quits: DevAntoine (~DevAntoin@78.196.234.32) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[08:47:07] <pussipupu> The current fashion seems to be pronouncing the planet name in a way that can't easily be confused with "your anus"
[08:49:51] <CuriosTiger> My solution is to pronounce the name of the planet the same as always, but to mock anyone who tries to use the pun.
[08:49:55] <CuriosTiger> because it does get old.
[08:50:28] <pussipupu> That's been my solution for decades, yeah
[08:51:06] <pussipupu> Though to be fair AIUI the "new" pronunciation is an old one revived, which is less annoying than inventing one from whole cloth
[08:51:28] <pussipupu> Not that it's a word I often say either way...
[08:56:05] <CuriosTiger> You could always go back to Ancient Greek with something like "OO-ra-noos"
[08:56:38] <LjL> greek has the stress on the last, oo-ra-NOSS
[08:56:44] <LjL> your way sounds Latin
[08:57:32] <pussipupu> Classics fight!
[08:58:34] <CuriosTiger> LjL: I sit corrected. I don't actually speak Greek.

[09:07:03] <pussipupu> I cannot find a copy of the Finnish translation of Colour of Magic
[09:07:10] <pussipupu> what is the Internet even for? :'(
[09:12:23] <CuriosTiger> Cat videos.
[09:12:39] <CuriosTiger> but I have found that search engines have gotten too smart for their own good.
[09:13:01] <CuriosTiger> They now pretty much ignore you when you try to search for an exact phrase by enclosing it in quotes, for example.
[09:13:07] <pussipupu> But also ideally buying books
[09:13:52] <pussipupu> ddg is better than Google at least for actually respecting search terms
[09:14:11] <pussipupu> Google just answers the question they think you should have asked it seems

[14:16:06] <FightingFalcon> Line length, or measure, is an important factor that influences both aesthetics and readability. A line length that is too short causes the eye to jump too frequently from one line to the next. If it is too long, it causes the reader’s eye to double back.
