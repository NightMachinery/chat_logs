[00:06:33] <artao> but hey! who of us hasn't tried right?
[00:06:58] <artao> but yeah. 5 gal. buckets are WELL worth keeping
[00:07:12] <artao> and cat litter buckets have a nice integrated lid
[00:07:52] <artao> i use em to store soil components and mix them, fishing buckets, mop bucket, structural components ...
[00:08:21] <artao> in an emergency they can be filled with water for usage, just as you'd fill your bathtub
[00:08:55] <DOMF> they're good for fermenting things too
[00:09:12] <artao> i use them for garbage cans too, with a bag in. another (with a bag) i used to clean the cat litter
[00:09:16] <artao> sure
[00:09:25] <artao> any bucket is good for what you'd use a bucket for
[00:09:36] <artao> heat and chemical resistances aside
[00:10:16] <artao> don't try to fill a styrofoam cooler with acetone, for instance
[00:12:05] <artao> the lid is particularly nice for fishing, biking hope with it in my bike trailer
[00:12:11] <artao> fish can't jump out
[00:12:31] <artao> i once even had to stop and go pick up a fish that had jumped out LOL
[00:12:49] <artao> on the other side i once caught a fish so big i had to bungee strap it to my bike
[00:12:55] <artao> 42" northern pike
[00:13:20] <artao> 107cm
[00:14:14] <artao> about 15 lbs (6.8kg)
[00:14:29] <artao> took me at least 15min to land it on 8lb test monofilament
[00:14:41] <artao> i hooked it while hip-deep in the water
[00:15:04] <artao> on a Mepps Black Fury #2
[00:15:07] <artao> spinner bait
[00:15:34] <artao> at first i thought i had a snag. then it moved and i thought it had a catfish. then it jumped like 30 ft away and i realized it was a huge northern
[00:15:58] <artao> to which i believe i had lost a lure the previous year, cuz it was in the exact same spot
[00:17:28] <artao> i didn't realize how big it was until i got it within a couple feet of me and saw it. ... could only see maybe a foot into the water (i was waist deep remember .. uh ... say 3ft/1m) and i saw this HUGE angry glaring head and i was just like ssSSHIIIT!
[00:17:44] <artao> opened up the drag almost fully and started backing in to shore
[00:17:46] <artao> LOL
[00:17:55] <artao> .......... i still have its head in my freezer
[00:18:04] <artao> that was like 13-ish yrs ago
[00:18:18] <artao> largest fish i've ever seen in the wild
[00:18:27] <artao> it didn't taste that great. "rivery"
[00:18:39] <artao> it also had a partially digested fish in its stomach
[00:19:09] <artao> a good to 8 to 10 inch ... something

[00:24:22] <artao> put my head underwater and i could legit hear them

[04:35:47] <macrobat> an adventure you did not choose
[04:36:13] <Bakunin> I had to do a lot of manual labor
[04:36:23] <Bakunin> I wasnt kitted out for snow
[04:36:34] <Bakunin> had my high top hikers on, not my work boots
[04:36:52] <Bakunin> walk 1/2 mile to house, get wheelbarrow and shovel, wheelbarros are basically sleds in the snow
[04:37:22] <Bakunin> so I had to load it up with some gravel conveniently .25 miles away, then push the heavily laden wheelbarrow uphill in the snow
[04:37:25] <Bakunin> to my car
[04:37:33] <Bakunin> which was in the ditch
[04:37:57] <Bakunin> of course the crown on the ditch is JUST ENOUGH to trap my car, despite having 8.75" clearance
[04:38:17] <Bakunin> I had to make two trips to the gravel pit
[04:38:31] <Bakunin> could only go like 10 steps at a time before stopping to catch breath
[04:39:33] <Bakunin> after totally blocking the ditch in front of my wheel, I ironically was able to back out and then crank the steering to ride up my lil gravel pile

[09:19:11] <morf> classic emo :]
[09:20:24] <piercedwater> i can't sing or play an instrument. but dammit, i would like to be in a band

[09:22:47] <sdragon> piercedwater: learn an instrument, maybe you'll get to be in a band!
[09:23:10] <piercedwater> you both are right
[09:23:12] <sdragon> Your best bets are drums and bass. There's tons of guitarists and vocalists out there already
[09:23:30] <piercedwater> hmm ok
[09:23:52] <piercedwater> i like keyboards/piano so maybe i'll hunt down one on the cheap
[09:25:19] <louipc> start with a song that only has 1 note.. then do one that has 2
[09:25:23] <louipc> then u learn
[09:25:52] <piercedwater> starting to get excited
[09:26:01] <louipc> honestly i would not even bother with a band
[09:26:19] <louipc> too many timewasters out there. do your own thing
[09:26:32] <louipc> plus people are at different skill levels. its hard to find ppl to match you
[09:27:06] <louipc> unless you find ppl to start off from scratch together with
[09:27:20] <louipc> but then again different development speeds
[09:27:42] <efex> bands are fun, jamming is great
[09:27:53] <louipc> i say do your own thing, jam with other ppl once in awhile, dont commit to a band
[09:28:09] <efex> but long term not so much I found
[09:28:22] <louipc> find collaboraters for song by song or something
[09:28:34] <louipc> yes efex guess we are saying the same thing basically
[09:28:42] <sdragon> Piano is easy to learn
[09:28:50] <sdragon> That's a great place to start
[09:28:59] <efex> imho, piano is not easy to learn.
[09:29:33] <efex> the realson there are amillion guitar players and almost no keyboard playerrs attests to it
[09:29:46] <efex> gaaah typo
[09:29:50] <efex> as usual
[09:30:18] <louipc> who knows. i think part of it is that piano isn't so portable
[09:30:24] <louipc> especially acoustic one
[09:32:05] <louipc> but then i guess electronic keyboard competes better than electric guitar on portability
[09:33:32] <efex> in my background, Ihave seen 100 guitar player for ever keyboard player
[09:33:38] <efex> perhaps more
[09:33:51] <louipc> plus guitar is 'kewl'
[09:34:29] <louipc> wonder if that ever changes
[09:34:44] <louipc> i guess it kindof changed to computer
[09:34:47] <efex> it’s a lot easier to get started on too
[09:35:01] <louipc> digital musicians/DJs are the hot shit
[09:35:22] <efex> keyboars ate everything else yeah to some extent
[09:37:25] <sdragon> The reason there's so many more guitar players than keyboard players is because electric guitar is a sexier instrument
[09:38:03] <macrobat> guitars are better for posing and looking RAWK
[09:38:22] <efex> fine if so.. I just see 100 guitars for every keyboard person
[09:38:50] <sdragon> Guitar was my first instrument
[09:39:04] <sdragon> I picked up keyboard/piano later on

[09:45:14] <murthy> I would want to tell my opinion on guitar piano and ease of learning but then efex would start taking about music theory :)

[09:46:12] <louipx> yes music theory is not to be discussed here
[09:46:21] <sdragon> Whaaaaaaaaat
[09:46:26] <sdragon> Why not?
[09:46:34] <louipx> dats a joke

[09:48:05] <murthy> I am a n00wb
[09:48:29] <louipc> do u play flute?
[09:48:37] <murthy> I wish
[09:48:45] <louipc> i thought u were gona do it
[09:48:47] <efex> I think music theory is awesome yes .. but I started out as a rock drummer..
[09:49:02] <murthy> Flute is my most favourite music instrument
[09:49:43] <louipc> i guess i started in choir at school
[09:49:57] <louipc> how bout u murthy 
[09:50:25] <murthy> Few weeks of music classes before college
[09:50:39] <sdragon> I like music theory
[09:50:44] <murthy> More like two weeks then I quit
[09:50:47] <efex> I started on oiano at 7 but quit at 10.. 11 was drums and trumprrt.
[09:50:58] <louipc> what do u do in 'music classes' tho
[09:51:02] <efex> choir! lucky you’
[09:51:11] <louipc> lol why lucky
[09:51:12] <murthy> Have to start the day, bbl
[09:51:32] <efex> sdragon: me too, it is a pile of explanations for stuff, super useful
[09:51:33] <murthy> You all have a nice day
[09:51:39] <efex> cya
[09:51:47] <sdragon> In my opinion, it's impossible to make music without some sort of understanding of music theory, even if you've never had any sort of formal training in it
[09:51:53] <louipc> i wish i did an actual instrument much earlier
[09:52:11] <louipc> why sdragon 
[09:52:30] <louipc> i think you can make music still
[09:52:35] <Bakunin> definitely false
[09:52:44] <Bakunin> theory just helps you sort choices
[09:52:49] <louipc> theory just raises your power level
[09:53:09] <sdragon> You might not be aware that you have any understanding of theory
[09:53:21] <louipc> lol ok
[09:53:39] <sdragon> You might not know any of the vocabulary
[09:53:52] <efex> sort choices, power level sure
[09:54:03] <efex> sdragon: yes!!
[09:55:04] <macrobat> maybe the threshold is higher for piano. pianists are expected to play more advanced stuff
[09:55:15] <efex> music theory in the end relates to the acostic properties of sound..  so if yu hear what is going on you have some “theory”
[09:55:27] <sdragon> efex: exactly!
[09:55:35] <louipc> macrobat: maybe kinda
[09:55:45] <macrobat> notation is better suited for piano
[09:55:46] <efex> piano and keyboards are not the same instruments to me
[09:57:10] <macrobat> on guitar, it's easy to transpose something a fret up or down if there's room and there's no open strings. more involved on piano, it doesn't look the same
[09:57:30] <sdragon> If you know how to tap out a simple drumbeat with your fingers, or if you know how to put two chords together in a way that sounds good, then you have some level of understanding of theory
[09:57:35] <louipc> macrobat: use a capo
[09:57:57] <macrobat> piano capos are so expensive :(
[09:58:25] <macrobat> not to mention, mechanically complicated
[09:58:34] <louipc> sdragon: i dont think thats what people refer to when they say music theory
[09:58:52] <louipc> carrying a tune or sense of rhythm
[09:59:14] <efex> louipc: to me that counts as music theiry in fact
[09:59:29] <efex> just appl.ied knowledge of how music works
[09:59:49] <sdragon> louipc: most people think that music theory requires some sort of formal education, but that's really not necessary
[09:59:51] <louipc> i dont think that really encompases what is known as music theory
[10:00:03] <efex> the study of “music theory” just explains that in greater detail
[10:00:10] <louipc> those are just tools that are part of music theory
[10:00:21] <macrobat> not that many guitar-like intruments with midi
[10:00:23] <louipc> sdragon: nothing requires formal education
[10:00:26] <sdragon> efex: you and I are totally on the same page on this
[10:00:50] <louipc> but music theory is more than hitting an accurate pitch or timing
[10:00:55] <efex> I btw have two music degrees

[10:01:21] <sdragon> I don't have any music degrees
[10:01:29] <louipc> me neither
[10:01:29] <efex> louipc: yes , it gets into greater detail in many ways, for sure
[10:01:33] <sdragon> But... I watch a lot of Adam Neely
[10:01:47] <efex> but it is still just about knowing how music works, either way
[10:01:55] <efex> heeee
[10:02:25] <efex>  I only mention that as I think sdragon’s idea has real musical validity
[10:02:25] <louipc> playing on key, or on time are like... knowing which way to turn a screw, or knowing to pick a wrench instead of a screwdriver
[10:02:29] <macrobat> getting the knowledge out through the fingers is another thing altogether
[10:02:46] <louipc> that doesnt mean the person 'understands' auto mechanics or engineering
[10:02:59] <efex> louipc: music theory is knowlege of musoic, as well
[10:03:17] <efex> both are part of understanding
[10:03:38] <efex> either without the other is weaker is all
[10:03:42] <louipc> efex: like knowing the lyrics of the latest ariana grande song?
[10:04:06] <efex> lyrics are poerty… differnt area :-)
[10:04:15] <efex> poetry
[10:04:45] <louipc> ok then knowing the 'tune' of it is music theory :p
[10:04:46] * efex runs
[10:04:52] <efex> sure
[10:05:16] <louipc> nah i reject that notion, but u got the degrees anyway lol ;)
[10:05:18] <efex> learning how to do that is taught in the ear traing portion of classes
[10:05:28] <macrobat> for, like, jazz standards, lyrics makes it easier to remember and know where you are in the tune.

[10:08:35] <Janet`> ^ The foot is the basic repeating rhythmic unit that forms part of a line of verse in most Indo-European traditions of poetry, including English accentual-syllabic verse and the quantitative meter of classical ancient Greek and Latin...
[10:08:56] <louipc> the bass-line?
[10:09:45] <louipc> macrobat: you know what would be funny.. rapper notation
[10:10:05] <louipc> would that be part of music theory or poetry theory
[10:10:22] <louipc> because sometimes they break into a tune
[10:10:31] <macrobat> do they agree on terms? isn't "flow" a very loose concept?
[10:10:46] <louipc> yea its not formalised as far as i know
[10:11:27] <macrobat> I assume there are several papers on that

[10:13:16] <macrobat> such is life
[10:14:06] <efex> rappers can be notated sure
[10:14:36] <efex> no notation describes every aspect of a sound after all
[10:14:50] <louipc> u can be the emminent rapper theorist
[10:15:17] <efex> win!]
[10:15:17] <macrobat> I don't even liek rap :/
[10:15:46] <efex> I ‘m ok with rap if it is well done
[10:15:53] <louipc> what about biggie
[10:16:15] <efex> not sure I can give country music that tho
[10:16:16] <macrobat> you can use theory to explore new concepts when you make music, so you're not stuck in a rut
[10:16:18] <efex> ehehe
[10:16:22] <sdragon> efex: I've never gone to music school, but I really enjoy self-education, and I'm opposed to academic elitism. There seems to be this general notion that you have to be a jazz player at an expensive university in order to know music theory, but I reject that sort of elitist attitude
[10:16:40] <efex> macrobat: yup pow instant ideas
[10:17:13] <efex> sdragon: I have never really encountered that mentality so I cant really comment to it
[10:17:49] <louipc> i have no idea what this labyrinth guyz doing sounds good tho
[10:17:55] <sdragon> efex: I mean more among people who haven't studied theory formally
[10:18:24] <efex> well, I have no idea why anyone would think that really
[10:18:24] <sdragon> Or among non-musicians
[10:18:24] <louipc> yea you dont need any univer-shitty
[10:18:38] <efex> but dunning kruger may aopply
[10:18:46] <louipc> if louis armstrong didnt need it then you dont either
[10:19:11] <macrobat> it would be hard to get the same exposure to and practise in music outside music conservatory. on your own you'd have to be so disciplined
[10:19:15] <efex> no!  some gifted players are so silly great they already have it all..

[10:21:51] <louipc> dang miles davis studied at julliard
[10:22:06] <sdragon> efex: you gotta remember, at one point, it was just accepted that being able to read standard notation was a prereq for learning any music theory
[10:23:05] <macrobat> you'd have to manage prima vista in order to be accepted. not reasonable?
[10:23:07] <efex> well, it still is as you need to know how to read and write ‘ to be able to reasd and write whioh you really need to be able to understand the idea
[10:23:38] <efex> but you read slowly, not real time!!!  fine! easy!!   (unlike real time reading entirely different)
[10:24:17] <efex> anybody can learn to read well enough to discuss ideas in a vewry short time, it is easy
[10:24:23] <louipc> hard to be considered a serious study in theory without knowing the notation
[10:24:38] <louipc> or at least invent your own notation ;)
[10:25:32] <sdragon> People say that the Beatles didn't know any theory, but really, they just never learned how to read sheet music. They still understood what they were doing when, for example, they'd modulate the key of a song
[10:26:03] <efex> the issue there is the stuff you read is still in standard notation
[10:26:25] <efex> and it would take forever to actually invent notation that actually worked
[10:28:36] <efex> they had great music theory, they did not need ti use notation as they just played the stuff

[10:29:13] <sdragon> Some musicians, especially in electronic music, are good with piano roll notation
[10:30:04] <macrobat> it's like reading and writing, or aritmetic. basic stuff is easy enough that you can become fluent and don't need to think about it
[10:30:54] <macrobat> facilitates musical activities
[10:31:10] <sdragon> Hm. I wonder if there's any musicians out there that can actually read MIDI data as notation
[10:31:37] <piercedwater> has anyone here converted vinyl to 48/16-bit? Did it sound good?
[10:31:48] <efex> I use piano roll all the time instead of notation
[10:31:59] <louipc> lilypond notation
[10:32:21] <efex> it wins
[10:32:50] <macrobat> how do I read and edit a raw midi file?
[10:33:19] <sdragon> I don't know, but I presume there is some way
[10:33:23] <macrobat> some of my vinyl doesn't even sound good. bacon&eggs
