[08:39:24] <CableNinja> @Jay-Ros ping me if you need anything else, I'm not paying attention here, but I'll see the highlight. I previously setup an entire ESXi environment, including deploying VMs, all by simply pluging in a usb stick and walking away

[08:40:02] <sd> 13<Jâ€‹ay-Ros> that's pretty neato!
[08:40:20] <CableNinja> the VMs were out on an AWS bucket, and esxi would query our API to determine what versions of the VMs to download
[08:40:41] <CableNinja> and then it had a daemon on the esxi side that ran and would query the api for updates, download the new VMs and deploy them in place

[08:41:42] <CableNinja> I didnt get to use ansible for this, it was to be a thing that store techs could walk into a new store, plug in and walk away
