[00:29:18] <ki9a> I love it
[00:29:24] <ki9a> Java uses a non standard way to encode utf8
[00:43:52] <BtbN> Only for its internal representation, which plain pre-dates UTF-8, and changing it now would be a major ABI break
[00:43:55] <_Shurik_> what does it use? wtf8?
[00:44:04] <BtbN> If you tell it to encode utf-8, you'll get proper utf-8
[00:45:49] <BtbN> iirc their stuff is _almost_ UTF-8, but without null-chars, or something like that?

[01:45:11] <brianonymous> its rude
[01:46:58] <Cecen> Normally the untyped interface shouldn't be exposed to any consumers or called outside of a single location, but C# access control doesn't support it

[12:58:53] <jmer> MaNa3k: it's super specific you're trying to convert from one datetime type to a less precise one which might cause data loss
[12:59:04] <jmer> MaNa3k: sure, but HOW are you importing the csv?
[12:59:07] <jmer> are you using polybase?
[12:59:26] <MaNa3k> no, the buldt in wizrd in ssms
[12:59:33] <jmer> My guess is that it's guesstimating the datetime type when importing the CSV and it's not getting the right one.

[13:02:56] <jmer> MaNa3k: read the link I posted first, he has the exact same errormessage you do ;)
[13:02:59] <MaNa3k> it would probably be faster too since ive already wated some hours on this problem

[13:08:54] <jmer> iirc a DateTime2 lets you define the scale as well
[13:08:58] <jmer> they need to be the same to not lose data

[13:09:49] <MatthiasVance> I would call that converting, but no for mapping types
[13:10:04] <jmer> MatthiasVance: you mean something that uses the Roslyn code gen stuff?
[13:10:15] <MatthiasVance> Think AutoMapper, but not a black box :D
[13:10:24] <jmer> I dislike AutoMapper
[13:10:55] <MatthiasVance> jmer: Yes, hence why I want code generation
[13:12:43] <jmer> MatthiasVance: I managed to google up this: https://mappinggenerator.net/

[14:44:11] <Nasp> MatthiasVance:  I think i found a project yesterday
[14:44:18] <Nasp> That did it, but not sure if they were great
[14:45:33] <Nasp> MatthiasVance:  https://github.com/amis92/csharp-source-generators
[14:45:44] <Nasp> Although most examples i found used Attributes for most things instead of fluent
[14:45:59] <Nasp> But i have a feeling it will come to mapster and the likes soon
[14:46:47] <MatthiasVance> hm hm hm
[14:47:11] <MatthiasVance> How would one instruct a source generator using "fluent syntax" as you describe Nasp ?
[14:47:25] <Nasp> Can't it just call the fluent method?
[14:47:39] <Nasp> Or can it only look at static stuff
[14:48:10] <MatthiasVance> It's at compile time
[14:48:37] <Nasp> Yeah ofc it isn't compiled yet so you probably can't run it
[14:48:46] *** Joins: jamea (~jamea@177.239.81.39)
[14:49:12] <Nasp> Looks like it maybe be possible
[14:49:20] <MatthiasVance> Well you could inspect the code of course :P
[14:49:27] <jamea> i get my ResultSet:  IEnumerable<dynamic> result2 = myConn.Query(qry);  how to know the last record? if(lastrecord) {}
[14:49:32] <Nasp> Yeh i think that's what this code does https://github.com/fiseni/SmartAnnotations
[14:49:54] <Nasp> I have a feeling those methods are empty and does nothing, let me look
[14:50:07] <MaNa3k> oki, heres a tricky problem. im reading a property value with reflections, and its decimal value, when i set it to string, the decimal point changes to comma. how can i avoid this ?
[14:50:23] <Nasp> Hmm no they actually have a method body
[14:51:02] <MaNa3k> i could do a replace(",",".") but that looks just stupid
[14:51:34] <Nasp> MatthiasVance:  What i was looking into yesterday was source generators DI libs
[14:51:44] <Nasp> I was thinking it could be nice to get compile errors if something is missing
[14:51:59] <MaNa3k> i read the value using reflections like so currPropInfo.GetValue(row, null);
[14:54:16] <Nasp> Isn't that mostly a display problem or do you need to ToString it?
[14:57:05] <MaNa3k> Nasp, i need to ToString it
[14:59:17] <Nasp> Then give it the format or culture
[14:59:24] <Nasp> Why do you need to ToString it?
[15:00:51] <MatthiasVance> Ah this one does it without attributes: https://github.com/paiden/SourceMapper/
[15:01:32] <Nasp> So you can run the code?
[15:01:41] <Nasp> During compile, hmm
[15:01:49] <MatthiasVance> no
[15:01:50] <MatthiasVance> https://github.com/paiden/SourceMapper/blob/main/src/SourceMapper/SourceMapper/Parsers/ContextParser.cs
[15:02:07] <Nasp> So it parses the expressions and then run those?
[15:02:09] <MatthiasVance> Technically you could do something hacky to run it, but you don't want to
[15:02:13] <MatthiasVance> It parses them period
[15:02:17] <MatthiasVance> No code is being run
[15:02:36] <Nasp> So the Make<T> method is empty?
[15:02:41] <Nasp> Because that other lib i linked had a body in them
[15:03:17] <Nasp> Yeah look like this does nothing
[15:03:20] <Nasp> https://github.com/paiden/SourceMapper/blob/1ff531853f2926bed155d98793ac7d03a4074a6f/src/SourceMapper/SourceMapper/SourceMapperContext.cs
[15:03:29] <Nasp> Kinda what i expected in the other lib, maybe it had runtime support as well
[15:05:28] <Nasp> MatthiasVance:  Btw Is it a requirement you need or because you want to test performance?
[15:06:15] <MatthiasVance> I am just looking into options to form an opinion :D
[15:06:40] <MatthiasVance> I never want runtime mapping, and static mapping is great but requires manual input often
[15:06:41] <Nasp> I like the idea of easier codegen, but sometimes i also feel like you could end up complicating some stuff a bit more
[15:06:52] <MatthiasVance> Compilation is easier, however.. how do you deal with the edge cases?
[15:07:01] <MatthiasVance> yes agreed
[15:07:16] <Nasp> If it breaks less people can probably fix it
[15:07:25] <Nasp> I've also wondered what would be the way way to generate code
[15:07:36] <Nasp> Like just parse it by outputting text to the compiler
[15:08:24] <Nasp> When i tried it easy became hard to follow even for a simple example and i was considering if using Razor or something like it for templating would be better
[15:09:12] <MatthiasVance> The "easiest" way might be generating source files in the project
[15:12:22] <Nasp> And comitting them?
[15:15:15] <MatthiasVance> yes, it's regular code isn't it
[15:15:25] <Nasp> But then it's basicly just T4 :D
[15:15:30] <MatthiasVance> Sure
[15:15:42] <Nasp> Having auto generated code on build you need to commit is annoying
[15:15:55] <MatthiasVance> Yes :D
[15:18:00] <MatthiasVance> You could also use an extension for that
[15:18:10] <MatthiasVance> Which is what that mapper generator person did
[15:18:25] <MatthiasVance> https://mappinggenerator.net/
[15:19:07] <Nasp> Does it also generate IQuerable mapping
[15:19:12] <Nasp> Else i would say it isn't that useful
[15:19:42] <MatthiasVance> Ah yes that's what I liked about Automapper
[15:19:47] <MatthiasVance> I don't think it does that
[15:25:19] <MatthiasVance> I'll just use Automapper
[15:25:23] <MatthiasVance> I need to speed up, not slow down

[20:33:07] <MatthiasVance> Here I was hoping that I could just do modelBuilder.Entity<ISomething>().ApplySomeConfiguration()
[20:33:18] <Nasp> QueryFilters are still missing a bit
[20:33:24] <Nasp> So you can more easily add more than one filter separately

[20:39:10] <Nasp> Instead of homemade EF on top of EF
[20:39:26] <Nasp> And needing to do .Where(x => !x.Deleted) everywhere
[20:39:38] <Nasp> Also when you soft delete should you at some point clean it up?=
[20:40:29] <MatthiasVance> You mean it was made using query filters
[20:40:33] <MatthiasVance> Yeah .. WHAT ELSE? :D
[20:40:40] <Nasp> No it's not
[20:40:45] <MatthiasVance> Yeah that's what I mean
[20:40:47] <Nasp> Well not global
[20:40:54] <dotdflat> and you can MatthiasVance since old versions. On EF core you can use ApplyConfiguration(new YourEntityMapping)

[20:45:59] <dotdflat> MatthiasVance: ah, I missed that. Why are you using interfaces? Most often they are quite simple and don't require big configurations. What's your use case?
[20:46:12] <MatthiasVance> dotdflat: Something something tenants
[20:46:27] <MatthiasVance> So most of the roots have a tenant id in the DB, but nowhere else, so I want filters everywhere automatically
[20:46:28] <Nasp> Are we talking interface for entities?
[20:47:11] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: Some of them, yes
[20:47:12] <Nasp> Yeah that's nice to have as an id
[20:47:16] <Nasp> Ehm interface
[20:47:29] <Nasp> Else you just end up with inheritance over composition
[20:48:34] <MatthiasVance> Indeed, I hardly ever use inheritance

[22:51:21] <JakeSays> well, the "language integrated" bit sort of implies it

[22:54:09] <JakeSays> in other words, you're still stuck with the same shitty iqueryable implementations
[22:54:15] <ki9a> linq has little to do with dbs though
[22:54:32] <brianonymous> its that boundary that cross from linq to db im uncertain of
[22:54:36] <MichaelLong> brianonymous, you don't need to apply linq only on DB stuff, it works with collections also
[22:54:39] <JakeSays> ki9a: right. 99% of my linq work doesn't involve dbs
[22:54:53] <ki9a> and EF has a way to get the real query
[22:55:01] <JakeSays> brianonymous: that is all contained in the iqueryable provider
[22:55:01] <ki9a> (during debug)
[22:55:03] <ki9a> if that's a concern

[22:56:03] <ki9a> the queryable provider
[22:56:03] <MichaelLong> what I never got right is the terminolory when using something like var bla = from blub in blubs select burp vs. blubs.FirstAndDefault(....).Select(...).
[22:56:16] <ki9a> I'm also quite thankful it now throws when you run queries that would do client side eval

[22:56:40] <ki9a> or run tons of quries
[22:56:47] <ki9a> now it fails

[22:58:13] <MichaelLong> sometimes it is not avoidable, have had the same issue lately with my small ef core test project
[22:58:16] <brianonymous> i mean, i did end up kinda brute forcing that. but id rather be like: hey, if these indexes collide, ignore and move on
[22:58:31] <ki9a> marten does upsert (store)
[22:58:34] <ki9a> that's quite useful
[22:58:40] <brianonymous> i think i read about that

[23:09:40] <JakeSays> so i wrote my own document store that did it in 2 hours.
[23:10:31] *** Quits: spikemaster (~user@dyn-170-233-154.myactv.net) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:11:22] <JakeSays> the ravendb dude also doesn't understand the agpl
[23:11:53] <ki9a> i don't touch anything that's agpl
[23:11:59] <ki9a> *especially* if it's a library
[23:12:13] <Nasp> Was it Ravendb v3 that they fucked up completely regarding performance
[23:12:55] <JakeSays> ki9a: same
[23:13:14] <jonp> JakeSays: i haven't heard about RavenDB & the AGPL…
[23:13:17] <JakeSays> Nasp: is that when they moved to their own store?
[23:13:18] <jonp> what happened there?
[23:13:34] <JakeSays> jonp: he claims that because it's agpl that you cannot use it for commercial purposes.
[23:13:42] <jonp> lol, no?
[23:13:58] <jonp> i mean, most companies won't touch it, but it can certainly be used commercially…
[23:13:59] <JakeSays> at least that was his stance at the time.
[23:14:00] <Nasp> JakeSays:  They changed their entire task scheudler
[23:14:03] <Nasp> And then it became useless
[23:14:06] <JakeSays> jonp: right

[23:17:14] <MatthiasVance> That experiment takes place inside, with closed windows..
[23:17:15] <MatthiasVance> :D
[23:17:29] <MatthiasVance> In an .. airfryer?
[23:17:31] <jonp> which karen?
[23:17:35] <jonp> MatthiasVance: apparently, yes.
[23:17:58] <jonp> i didn't see a reply from an "audry williams" to the "air fry a big mac" tweet thread
[23:18:40] <jonp> also, @KLobstar's wife must be a saint to put up with that shit

[23:20:21] <blez> JakeSays sounds like annoying feminazi
[23:23:18] <Nasp> jonp:  Do you join documents / include with Marten?
[23:23:31] <jonp> i don't know what "Marten" is
[23:23:34] <jonp> so…no?
[23:23:50] <Nasp> Ohh right it was ki9a
[23:24:12] <ki9a> Nasp: I use it in 1 placec
[23:24:15] <ki9a> worked
[23:24:24] <ki9a> the newer api is better though
[23:24:27] <ki9a> in v4
[23:26:51] <Nasp> V5 is just on it's way
[23:26:57] <Nasp> With newest ngpsql
[23:29:20] <ki9a> JakeSays: https://godbolt.org/z/MoMzE9Kha ever seen asm disappear in llvm?
[23:29:27] <ki9a> O3 works, O0 does not
[23:30:03] <jonp> ki9a: that sounds like a bug
[23:30:12] <ki9a> It does
[23:30:40] <jonp> broke in llc 6.0.0
[23:30:44] <ki9a> It's also usually the other way around
[23:30:49] <ki9a> O3 kills code, O0 does not
[23:30:51] <jonp> works in llc 5.0.0, as per the drop-down in the middle column
[23:31:00] <ki9a> llc 5 is antique though
[23:31:14] <jonp> agreed
[23:31:54] <ki9a> It also sounds like a weird thing nobody ever seen this in all those years
[23:32:49] <jonp> -O2 also retains the assembly
[23:33:14] <ki9a> 1 too
[23:33:17] <jonp> yup
[23:33:27] <jonp> tried -Os, but that fails to compile
[23:33:31] <jonp> what's the equivalent?
[23:33:57] <Slade> "The U.S. added more than 1 million people to its Covid-19 case count on Monday as the true scope of a surge in infections over the holidays began to round into view."
[23:34:21] <Slade> another for the Guinness book of world records
[23:34:25] <jonp> ah, llc docs stipulate `-O=uint`
[23:34:56] <jonp> guess there isn't a -Os equivalent
[23:35:20] <ki9a> I don't see a S no
[23:35:25] <ki9a> which is odd
[23:36:11] <ki9a> I get the most intersting issues with llvm really
[23:36:50] <ki9a> It's a damn shame cranelift isn't "done" enough yet
[23:36:54] <ki9a> Else i'd switch to that
[23:37:10] <ki9a> (it lacks SEH, arm and some other stuff I need)

[23:44:49] <lz_> I have a dumb question; my android phone's camera resolution is set to 13mp but when i take pictures they're like 3kx1.5k, that's not 13mp is it? did I miss a setting?
[23:45:55] <lz_> or maybe 13mp is just the sensor and the phone can't take big pics
[23:46:15] <jonp> camera phones are complicated :-)
[23:46:20] <jonp> see also "computation photography"
[23:47:01] <jonp> phone cameras are noisy AF; it's very common for "computation photography" to average pixels, apply machine learning, etc., to give a good resulting image
[23:47:29] <jonp> that said… check your camera settings
