[23:38:57] <tzar_bomba> Can someone give me a pointer on how https://github.com/scheme-requests-for-implementation/srfi-116 expects to run the tests with chicken? It seems I can't find a way to properly import the srfi-116 module, because the error I'm getting is about number not being a function, because it fails to understand / expand iq macro in `(iq (1) (2) (3))`
[23:41:13] <Bunny351> assuming you are in the directory above "tests", does "csi -s tests/run.scm" work?
[23:43:24] <Bunny351> also, there seems to be no "number" identifier anywhere.
[23:43:56] <Bunny351> I can only see "number?"
[23:48:26] <tzar_bomba> hmm I been using csc. csi from directory fails because it uses include from "../ilists". If I cd into tests, and do `csi -s run.scm` I get an error "toplevel definition in non-toplevel context for variable: abc". Note that I have locally refactored, and moved all internal `define` at the start of test-group

[23:56:22] <Bunny351> have you built and installed srfi-166?
[23:56:51] <Bunny351> and are you using CHICKEN 4?
