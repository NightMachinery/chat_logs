[00:21:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: Could you explain what makes it "stackable" and a "monitor stand"
[00:22:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: i.e., how does this work
[00:23:16] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: you just put a monitor on top
[00:23:20] <feep> and then   it is higher up
[00:23:41] <feep> it's stackable in that you can print four of the foot parts and stick them in the holes in the bottom
[00:23:49] <feep> the foot parts also have holes in their bottom, etc
[00:23:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh
[00:24:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> So it's not stackable
[00:24:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's just ... height-adjustable

[00:24:42] <feep> well, you can
[00:24:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> But no this is cool
[00:24:48] <feep> the feet stack with more feet
[00:25:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> But the monitor holder doesn't stack with additional of the same monitor holder.
[00:25:06] <feep> yes

[03:25:32] <gwern> yeah, I'm dropping bittorrent this year. people are still using it, but it's causing too many problems
[03:26:19] <gwern> quite aside from how it takes literally days to create and check the torrents, rtorrent spends most of its time frozen, and on my workstation, it's outright segfaulting on some torrents for mysterious reasons that may involve symlinks
[03:26:51] <gwern> even if I did torrents for danbooru2021, danbooru2022 and 23 would definitely kill it, so I'm not going to bust my butt for '21

[10:31:24] <spxtr> I'm not convinced that web3 isn't completely stupid
[10:42:06] <PapuaHardyNet> spxtr: we had this conversation before, but I'll say it again - it is entirely ethical to provide a Veblen good to people who are willing to spend a lot of money, especially if you plan on using that money to help people you care about.
[10:42:47] <PapuaHardyNet> last time I said it in context of EA and charities, but hey, I personally care less about charities as much as friends and family
[10:43:04] <PapuaHardyNet> it is completely stupid, though. I agree with you on that
[10:43:08] <adiabatic> that sounds like a reasonable take
[10:43:51] <spxtr> I also think that is a reasonable take

Logging into OpenSea with MetaMask blew my mind." except we just found out it's literally just json going over https lmao
[14:08:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> The problem is that (a) those blockchain operations are completely pointless because they create nothing of any value, and (b) that the amount of money that gullible idiots fork over for NFTs has nothing to do with how much compute and electricity it took to generate the blocks or w/e
[14:08:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> And yeah also what saturn2 said of course, it turns out to all be fake anyway which adds a whole other layer of point-missing

[14:12:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> 1. We can generate all the fucking avatars we want with GANs and stuff now, it's absurd to even suggest that we need blockchain in any form for it
[14:12:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> 2. Whatever the "NFT avatar projects" are doing can obviously be done without blockchain
[14:12:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> 3. Right-click, Save As
[14:13:17] <saturn2> fake-ass json-over-http will always outcompete actual crypto for the same worse is better reasons that always ruin everything else
[14:13:38] <nshepperd> saturn2: eh, i don't think that part is json over https
[14:13:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> In short, this whole perspective totally ignores the fact that everyone who thinks the "art theft!!!" crowd is dumb *also* thinks NFTs are dumb
[14:13:46] <nshepperd> but it's also not really a blockchain thing
[14:13:59] <nshepperd> it's just client certificates
[14:14:40] <nshepperd> which happens to actually work in this case because a crypto wallet necessitates having some sort of private key in your possession
[14:15:12] <saturn2> oh okay

[14:17:58] <nshepperd> Obormot\Arcturus: the point is to get social status for donating to artists you like, that's all
[14:18:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> Micropayments would certainly be cool but thinking that web3 is the road to people producing things of real value and being paid well for it is delusional
[14:19:04] <nshepperd> and making that social status transferable i guess, which presumably increases the amount of donations but idk how much
[14:19:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> The more transferable social status is, the less it's social status and thus the less it's worth
[14:19:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> Definitionally
[14:19:39] <nshepperd> noooo, not exactly
[14:20:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's not the real problem though, which is that the mechanism by which these supposed donations to artists people like happen is one that incentivizes the production of fake bullshit, which means that whoever is best at producing fake bullshit will outcompete whoever's not as good at it (or doesn't want to do it)
[14:21:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> (This is helped along tremendously by the fact that the web3 system doesn't actually, by any means whatever, require that one first produce any value before one can solicit and receive these "donations")

[14:52:43] <nshepperd> knew it hehehe
[14:55:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> I'm sure I've told this anecdote before, but just to hammer in the point: in the offices where the people in my research all worked, our PI had a printout taped to the wall with two lists of words: a list of words that we should aim to include in paper titles, abstracts, conference poster headings, etc., and a second list of words that we should *never* put into those things
[14:55:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> First list had stuff like "novel" "original" "discovered" etc.; second list was stuff like "developed" "built" "replicated" "improved" etc.
[14:56:20] <PapuaHardyNet> nshepperd: so the 129M model is so huge for the remote (your TPU) that I can only train it on a batch size of 1 without jax throwing a "failed to allocate" error
[14:56:23] <dutchie> sounds about right. we had a talk about "how to write papers that get citations in high IF journals" and it was all "optimise the hell out of your title, then your abstract"
[14:56:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> Because if you submitted a paper about how you built a system or improved a result or whatever, you would never get it accepted ever
[14:56:48] <dutchie> he had some stats about the drop off between people reading titles, reading abstracts, and then the full paper
[14:56:58] <dutchie> iirc it was about 90% each time
[14:57:03] <PapuaHardyNet> that's not very good, of course, because lol, batch size of 1 means you are losing a lot of generalizability

[17:44:22] <PapuaHardyNet> not really, I know at least two people who are masters at this, and they are basically "super-connectors" - both know a ton of extremely interesting and competent people and are great at organizing and managing people towards a task
[17:44:49] <PapuaHardyNet> I think this is a fundamental skill if you want to get better at dealing with people.
[17:45:21] <PapuaHardyNet> I'm positive most neurotypical people who are anything near successful do this automatically
[17:46:36] <catern> sorry, what skill are we talking about? I'm talking about the skill of writing explanations of complicated topics
[17:47:01] <catern> that skills is certainly correlated with what you talked about, but I don't think it's the same thing
[17:47:51] <PapuaHardyNet> oh lol, I meant communicating things in a way another person understands
[17:48:22] <PapuaHardyNet> the heuristic makes a lot of sense if you are writing an explanation of a complicated topic yeah
[17:49:24] <catern> this conversation proves the use of the heuristic - if I had been aiming at an introductory level, I wouldn't have assumed we were talking about the same thing :)

[18:04:28] <PapuaHardyNet> what

[19:28:49] <PapuaHardyNet> okay you remember when shawwn used to say he was running his website off of a TPU?
[19:28:57] <PapuaHardyNet> well that wasn't technically true
[19:29:26] <gwern> he was running it off the embedded CPU which was pretty darn chonkers, iirc
[19:29:43] <PapuaHardyNet> TPU pods all have Intel Xeon CPUs, which have 2 sockets each with 24 cores with 2 theads each
[19:29:59] <gwern> yes, we were both astonished when we found that out
[19:30:13] <gwern> that's a pretty damn high end CPU to just throw into your $1/hr TPU
[19:30:31] <gwern> it was also hard to access & undocumented even though it's vital to do all your image IO etc on
[19:30:57] <PapuaHardyNet> I think he was referring to these Xeon CPUs. Or was that actually what he meant to say? I assumed he was literally referring to the TPU
[19:31:42] <gwern> he was referring to the xeon, I'm pretty sure. of course you *can* run a VM or something on the TPU itself, almost certainly (see the Linux VM in shaders the other day) but he didn't
[19:32:32] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah, all right. also, the VM on TPU thing sounds pretty crazy hahah
[19:34:50] <nshepperd2> hmm, tpus aren't quite as general purpose as gpus i think so it's probably a lot harder
[19:35:25] <nshepperd2> (do they have virtual memory? i don't think so?)

[19:42:46] <nshepperd2> they don't have address translation hardware like a cpu has
