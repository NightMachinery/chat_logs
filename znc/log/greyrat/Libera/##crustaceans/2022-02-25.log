[00:16:49] <buttsbot> Tick Survives 27 Years in Researcher's Lab, 8 Years Without Food
[00:18:53] <Brekkjern> That sucks...
[00:19:24] <manicennui> It didn't suck for long periods of time though.
[00:20:30] <manicennui> "Olms, a type of cave salamander, can live without food for up to a decade, while large crocodiles can go over a year without eating."
[00:30:54] <kline> >ticks
[00:31:02] <kline> now theres a reason to engage in nuclear war
[00:31:14] <manicennui> They'd probably survive somehow.
[00:31:20] <kline> you know a tick bite can make you allergic to meat?
[00:31:26] <manicennui> Then mutate and become stronger.
[00:31:29] <Brekkjern> So you want radioactive ticks?
[00:31:30] <kline> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-gal_allergy
[00:31:30] <buttsbot> Alpha-gal allergy - Wikipedia
[00:31:50] <manicennui> Apparently tick numbers have exploded in the last several years.
[00:32:10] <manicennui> And tick-borne diseases are way up.
[00:35:56] <manicennui> Everything is trying to kill us, including us.
[00:36:18] <Brekkjern> And, of course, we're winning!
[00:46:44] <Brekkjern> https://i.redd.it/2491c6c9yrj81.png
[01:28:02] <companion_cube> Hopefully there's a lyme disease vaccine in our future
[01:31:14] <bkero> I certainly hope so, that disease is *real* nasty if left to fester.
[01:33:41] <companion_cube> kline: ticks? Try bedbugs
[01:34:24] <manicennui> Just never leave your home.
[01:34:45] <kline> companion_cube, bedbugs are "just" annoying
[01:34:52] <manicennui> companion_cube: Do bedbugs carry any actual diseases though?
[01:34:53] <kline> (seriously, seriously annoying)
[01:34:58] <manicennui> Yeah.
[01:35:00] <companion_cube> No they don't
[01:35:02] <kline> but they dont give you lymes
[01:35:05] <companion_cube> They're just maddening
[01:35:11] <companion_cube> Also bad for mental health
[01:35:11] <manicennui> I'd respect them more if they were killing us.
[01:35:12] <kline> nor do them turn you into an involuntary vegan
[01:37:42] <manicennui> Don't hear much about mosquitos in the US these days.
[01:37:49] <manicennui> They obviously still exist and are annoying.
[01:38:17] <bkero> Hey now, they don't turn you into a vegan
[01:38:22] <bkero> They just mean you can't eat red meat anymore
[01:38:28] <bkero> Which is almost as bad.
[01:38:30] <companion_cube> If you can still eat dairy you're golden
[01:38:40] <manicennui> Maybe ticks are trying to save the planet.

[03:01:39] <kline> ngoldbaum, i mean, its a valid concern and the right answer is for people to either not comment on the notice, or to roll some non-commentable warning in
[03:02:25] <kline> another, better option is for the yanks to stop getting so bent out of shape about people holding clearances seeing stuff thats entered the public domain
[03:02:38] <Brekkjern> I was about to say...
[03:02:47] <Brekkjern> The entire practice is fucking idiotic.
[03:02:48] <ngoldbaum> i would also take not arguing about it in the comments
[03:03:15] <kline> the concern about going to jail is dumb, since most of the time all you need to do is inform the aftercare service that it happened and clear the relevent docs
[03:03:39] <kline> but thats still a pain
[03:03:48] <kline> and until it doesnt happen, its fair to include a warning
[03:03:50] <Brekkjern> I've heard of worse pains :P

[21:14:11] <manicennui> I wish Google sold their fabric cases for the Pixel 6.

[21:39:41] <gerikson> gwozniak: yeah, photo forums have a strong correlation with astronomy
[21:40:58] <gerikson> so many photographers like astrophoto, and i think it's because it's pure technique, no artistry required
[21:41:14] <gerikson> and you can "objectively" determine if an image is good or not
[21:42:00] <gerikson> same with macro

[21:47:46] <gerikson> prussian: that kind of overprocessed landscape phootography is inexplicably popular
[21:48:09] <gwozniak> The thing I do love about astrophography is that it can pick up stuff you can't see, so the photos are just lovely to study
[21:49:05] <gwozniak> I took a shitty pic of Andromeda and it's still way more detail than what you can see through the eyepiece
[21:49:28] <gerikson> hey, if it floats your boat, go for it
[21:49:42] <gerikson> personally I don't like being out in the cold and dark

[21:56:11] <gwozniak> I rarely have to worry about going out in the winter because the weather is usually terrible for observing here

[22:01:52] <river> hm
[22:02:06] <river> does windows 10 expose a local dns server, that a virtual box vm can use for example?
[22:02:28] <river> im trying to configure vbox to do all the same custom things win10 does... would be nice if it could just use its resolver directly
[22:03:00] <gerikson> hehe yeah

[22:19:11] <ngoldbaum> gerikson: i also ran into the heinlein circlejerk earlier ugh
[22:19:39] <ngoldbaum> tbh, makes sense that HN people like late creepy heinlein
[22:20:45] <gwozniak> I've not read any Heinlein.  What should I read that would give me a good idea what his work is like, in general?
[22:20:57] <gwozniak> Or is it just a waste of my time?
[22:21:16] <bkero> Late Heinlein
[22:21:21] <bkero> when he turned into a dirty old man
[22:21:52] <bkero> Or if you want to go Half Ayn Rand: The Moon is a Harsh Mistress.
[22:22:17] <gerikson> gwozniak: I'd say "Moon..." and Starship Troopers give a good overview
[22:22:28] <gerikson> I have not read "Stranger... "
[22:22:28] <bkero> Definitely *NOT* Farnham's Freehold.
[22:22:29] <manicennui> Most of his stuff has a libertarian slant.
[22:23:49] <manicennui> And don't expect Starship Troopers to be like the movie.
[22:24:35] <ngoldbaum> movie: satire of military fascism; book: apology for military fascism
[22:25:38] <gerikson> that said, I think Samuel R Delaney wrote he was thrilled to realize the protag of ST was of Philipino heritage
[22:26:58] <gerikson> I don't think Heinlein was *that* racist
[22:27:02] <gerikson> I might be wrong
[22:28:18] <ngoldbaum> huh valve made another portal thing for the steam deck
[22:28:55] <bkero> gotta show off those new gaming input devices: touchpads
[22:31:14] <imode> "steam deck is a mess" is something I've seen.
