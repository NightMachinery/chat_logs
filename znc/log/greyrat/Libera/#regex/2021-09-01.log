[00:01:45] <ZZzz> Does anybody have an idea for an efficient RegEx for this table: https://gitlab.com/pninim.org/dar/dar-syntax/-/blob/master/syntax.dar#L254   It should capture (1) the caption (before or after the table), (2) the table frame, (3) optional ":" signs and (4) content of the table cells... Thank you!
[00:14:01] <dmaislin> https://regex101.com/r/oKBXta/1
[00:19:29] <ZZzz> dmaislin: thank you! its only caption and what about the rest? items 2-4... the table itself and so on...
[00:19:43] <ZZzz> (2) the table frame, (3) optional ":" signs and (4) content of the table cells...
[00:25:46] <ZZzz> to me it looks like quite a complex problem...
[00:30:29] <dmaislin> Do you want like cates=500, dogs=700 ?
[00:31:29] <ZZzz> content can be anything
[00:31:37] <ZZzz> content of the cells
[00:31:46] <dmaislin> Right, but column 1 is name, column 2 is value?
[00:32:29] <dmaislin> Or just all values in all cells?
[00:34:00] <ZZzz> anything - names in all or values in all... its just an example of a table... table can have NxM cells, with whatever content
[00:35:01] <ZZzz> I'm not sure it is possible to find such a generic regex...

[12:59:11] <digitok> this would be my idea https://regex101.com/r/9O4qko/1
[12:59:43] <digitok> match 1 contains the caption, headings, and : alignment things in 3 groups
[13:00:01] <digitok> subsequent matches contain a row of cells
[13:00:13] <digitok> and the last match contains the caption if there is one
[13:00:52] <digitok> you'd then need to process that further to get all of the :'s etc etc
[13:01:51] <digitok> for example, https://regex101.com/r/9O4qko/2
[13:02:02] <digitok> you get one match for each column
[13:02:28] <digitok> if it contains group 1, left align, both groups center, group 2 right

[15:53:48] <cloud> I think I might have an older version
[15:54:04] <cloud> This is perl, v5.10.1 (*) built for x86_64-linux-thread-multi

[16:04:21] <purplex> what does the file contain? i can do a quick test

[16:06:30] <cloud> that prints all the file's contents
[16:06:56] <digitok> yea
[16:06:59] <digitok> that means it works
[16:08:15] <cloud> that's good, but let's say that in the provided file content, I only want to return a single match at a time. for instance, the second match in the data, containing my_pattern: hostname1.local
[16:08:35] <digitok> no idea about that :D
[16:08:57] <digitok> there are ppl here that know perl commands though
[16:09:25] <digitok> but you need to get it working with the regex first yea
[16:09:30] <cloud> like: ^(\h*"\*.*host1(?:.*\n)*?)\h*"\*+",\n(.*(?:\n(?!\h*"\*+",$).*)*)
[16:09:32] <purplex> looked at code generator as well?
[16:09:36] <cloud> this looks good on regex101
[16:10:06] <cloud> but still prints everything in my shell
[16:10:15] <digitok> what does your perl command look like
[16:10:41] <digitok> by everything do you mean everything or all matches

[16:47:36] <digitok> yep

[16:50:21] <digitok> does this print the whole file
[16:50:35] <cloud> yes, but adds an extra empty line after each line in the file
[16:50:41] <digitok> yep
[16:51:16] <digitok> the file wouldn't contain \r's would it?

[16:55:45] <purplex> Using \R shouldn't hurt anything at all. \R is also my favorite since it matches any kind of newlines (including unicode)
[16:55:51] <digitok> ok, and file.txt contains the exact same data as re101 right?
[16:56:02] <digitok> with literal "my_pattern" not something else
[16:57:09] <cloud> that's correct. I only modified the hostnames to host1, host2, etc. for easier reading
[16:57:30] <digitok> weird :/
[16:58:51] <purplex> regex101 doesn't have perl, can this be engine dependent behavior?

[19:40:50] <rapha> hi all
[19:42:46] <rapha> in https://regex101.com/r/uXG5D7/1 , is it possible to express the optional nature of those groups of things inside (...)? without using capture groups, whilst keeping them optional as a whole and in the order they're in?

[19:46:41] <tar-regx> The regular expression works fine, but [\w\.-] section makes it prone to ReDoS attack and catastrophic backtracking
[19:46:41] <tar-regx> Could anyone suggest me a alternate way ?

[19:47:13] <tar-regx> Me-me: I am not sure it's Perl compatible 
[19:47:31] <tar-regx> I was trying this in Javascript code
[19:48:33] <Me-me> [\w.-]+(?:\.[\w\.-]++)+ matches the same things [\w.-]+
[19:48:38] <Me-me> So just remove the group and you'll be fine.
[19:49:14] <tar-regx> Great Me-me, I will try it out and let you know
