[16:34:34] <woodwose> why the fuck is ff ignoring gtk settings?
[16:35:14] <woodwose> in particular these https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1744396
[16:35:31] <woodwose> open for 3 month and they don't give a shit, absolutely ridiculous
[16:35:55] <Cork> woodwose: cause firefox isn't (and have never been) a gtk framework program
[16:36:15] <Cork> it reads some gtk settings/themes similar, but they all have to be explicitly reimplemented
[16:36:32] <woodwose> are there switches to simulate the behaviour?
[16:36:42] <woodwose> Cork, why then is that bug report still open?
[16:36:51] <woodwose> they should at least comment on that
[16:37:16] <Cork> woodwose: most likely cause noone have implemented a solution so firefox reads and follows the settings
[16:37:19] <Cork> -s
[16:37:31] <woodwose> well that is still ridiculous
[16:37:47] <Cork> its a bug report not a forum, so there won't really be a discusion until someone looks into it
[16:37:54] <Cork> also the report is unconfirmed
[16:38:07] <Cork> so it isn't even verified yet
[16:38:10] <woodwose> I just confirmed this stupid behaviour of ff
[16:38:37] <woodwose> btw, ff wasn't doing that (ignoring such settings) "in the past"
[16:38:49] <woodwose> I recently switched to wayland, not sure if that takes a role in this
[16:38:58] <Cork> it was reading it, and it was missed somewhere in the rewrite
[16:39:18] <Cork> as it isn't using a standard gtk framweork it isn't ignoring, it just isn't following it
[16:39:36] <woodwose> it's relevant to privacy, as it writes data despite the private mode
[16:40:13] <Cork> sure, i don't say it isn't a bug, just it isn't "why did you ignore the setting" is looking at it from the wrong direction
[16:40:29] <woodwose> Cork, I don't care about what you have to say
[16:40:32] <Cork> it is "they forgot to add support for the setting in the rewrite"
[16:40:38] <woodwose> I just hope mozilla will fix that
[16:40:40] <woodwose> asap
[16:40:56] <Cork> asap isn't likely unless your willing to write the code change your self
[16:41:17] <woodwose> asap, or mozilla will lose a user
[16:41:32] <Cork> they have more important problems that will have priority
[16:41:41] <woodwose> I bet
[16:41:45] <woodwose> like fucking up the UI
[16:41:52] <Cork> sigh...
[16:47:45] <woodwose> seriously, though, why the fuck is it still writing to disc when you save files from a private window
[16:48:01] <woodwose> that's is just such a stupid oversight

[18:47:22] <cornfeedhobo> Here is a strange one:  On linux, if the system is starting from some previous state where firefox was open, firefox gets into a broken state where it refuses to identify a working internet connection after NetworkManager catches up. Does anyone have a fix for this?
[18:49:41] <susi> I guess your bug was moved to wrong component by the bot

[18:52:34] <cornfeedhobo> if i kill firefox and restart it, it immediately works again. if i disconnect from wifi and reconnect, same problem - firefox has no idea that the network is back
[19:00:24] <susi> too strange a problem, are you sure it's firefox that's failing
[19:05:13] <cornfeedhobo> yes. there are many reports of the same issue with other linux users
[19:05:27] <cornfeedhobo> i can reproduce this all day with a fresh install of opensuse
[19:05:32] <cornfeedhobo> on various devices
[19:05:43] <cornfeedhobo> chromium, chrome, opera - all work fine
[19:13:42] <cornfeedhobo> meh. plasma integration plugin solves this i guess
