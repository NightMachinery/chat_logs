[00:05:46] <matthugh> flatcap: how have you been?
[00:06:35] <flatcap> very busy, as always :-)
[00:07:49] <matthugh> yeah, I'm always a bit shocked when I fetch neomutt and see the number of commits/number of changes you manage to make...and that's just the one repo
[00:08:46] <flatcap> :-)
[00:09:15] <flatcap> I need to make another release, but there's still so much more I need to fix
[00:15:48] <matthugh> well for my part, #2853 has been rebased on master (a couple of days ago)....I think lesson learned, I should probably stick trying to add features I'll definitely use myself :<
[00:15:49] <neo-bot> PR by @matthewhughes934 "Create mailbox for maildir": https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/pull/2853
[00:16:07] <matthugh> let me know if you're still interested in it
[00:17:48] *** Joins: inlight (~thomas@user/inlight)
[00:17:53] <inlight> hello 
[00:17:58] <inlight> i need help with neomutt
[00:18:03] <inlight> i am unable to compile from source 
[00:18:08] <inlight> it says config.h not found 
[00:18:21] <inlight> i am on alpine linux , we have musl and i am using clang
[00:18:25] <flatcap> matthugh: yes, great.  sorry, I've not made more time to help
[00:19:08] <flatcap> inlight: you need to run `./configure` first.  `./configure --help` will give you all the compile options
[00:19:31] <inlight> it gave some error
[00:19:33] <matthugh> flatcap: no worries, I've been letting it rot a bit :'(
[00:20:35] <inlight> what i did, was, i downloaded source from github with wget
[00:20:41] <inlight> not from git
[00:20:59] <matthugh> inlight: which errors did you see?
[00:21:00] <inlight> and does it requires any dependecy when bulding from source
[00:21:38] <inlight> let me try again
[00:23:40] <flatcap> few deps.  none for maildir, imap. but if you want signing/encryption, or the header cache
[00:23:48] <inlight> No installed jimsh or tclsh, building local bootstrap jimsh0
[00:24:48] <flatcap> that's fine.  if you don't have tcl installed, there's a minimal version bundled with the source
[00:25:02] <inlight> configure gave that error
[00:25:08] <inlight> how do i proceed compiling?
[00:25:16] <inlight> should i compile with my c compiler directly ?
[00:25:24] <inlight> it gives config.h not found error
[00:26:37] *** Quits: epony (epony@user/epony) (Quit: QUIT)
[00:27:23] <inlight> ???
[00:27:38] <matthugh> inlight: is that the last line in the output of ./configure ?
[00:27:58] <inlight> which error?
[00:28:12] <inlight> if i try to compile manually withm y compiler, it gives config.h not found error
[00:28:26] <inlight> and the error i posted before, it's the first line from ./configure
[00:29:01] <inlight> 2nd line is no working c compiler found tried cc and gcc because i use clang, i will change it to clang
[00:31:06] <matthugh> I think a successful run of ./configure will result in configure.h being created. So if ./configure fails you won't be able to compile
[00:31:10] <flatcap> you need to run configure to generate config.h
[00:31:57] <flatcap> it checks that you've got all the deps you'll need to build neomutt
[00:32:21] <flatcap> if you can't install tcl or jimsh, you'll need to be able to build autosetup/jimsh0.c
[00:32:54] <inlight> i can install if needed
[00:33:16] <inlight> how can i configure ./configure to use my custom compiler

[00:34:29] <inlight> i want it to pass arguments

[00:37:15] <inlight> now what to do
[00:37:25] <flatcap> now, run configure
[00:37:52] <flatcap> there's a quick overview of options/env vars, here: https://neomutt.org/dev/build/build
[00:39:29] <inlight> Error: Failed to find ar
[00:39:30] <inlight> Try: 'configure --help' for options
[00:39:41] <inlight> ./configure gave "ar" error
[00:39:58] <flatcap> you'll need to install 'ar' -- it's commonly used by builds to create libraries
[00:40:39] <inlight> there is nothing like ar
[00:41:25] <flatcap> it's in package `binutils` (on my Fedora box)
[00:44:28] <inlight> there is no xsltproc pakcage for alpine linux
[00:44:43] <inlight> why neomutt didn't provide a tar.gz binary ? 
[00:44:44] <flatcap> then you'll have to skip the docs `--disable-doc`
[00:45:12] <inlight> that would've been better, so i could've been just placed the binary and changed the interpreter if any dynamic-lib isuse
[00:45:17] <flatcap> NO
[00:45:37] <flatcap> this project is little more than *me* -- no offense to the other devs
[00:45:58] <flatcap> if people want packages for every distro, they can make them, themselves
[00:46:48] <inlight> also unless i mentaion --lua --notmuch these feature won't be isntalled, right?
[00:46:58] <flatcap> correct
[00:47:06] <inlight> flatcap: i said, a simple tar.gz  file, not package
[00:47:12] <flatcap> configure will check if you have the right packages installed to build them
[00:47:33] <flatcap> the source .tar.gz is available on the Github release page
[00:47:44] <inlight> ncures is default or slang is default?
[00:47:48] <flatcap> but binaries take a lot of effort to maintain
[00:48:06] <flatcap> ncurses only, for recent versions
[00:48:21] <flatcap> the slang implementation was buggy and rarely used
[00:48:31] <inlight> is ncurses included in source?
[00:48:38] <flatcap> no
[00:49:03] <flatcap> that's enough questions for me. perhaps someone else has the time to help you

[16:07:41] <flatcap> haritz: can you show us an example?
[16:08:24] *** Joins: holgersson (~quassel@user/holgersson)
[16:08:44] <haritz> sure
[16:10:57] <haritz> so let's say I've the following folder hook set in my config file
[16:11:00] <haritz> folder-hook gmail/* "source ~/.mutt/accounts/gmail"
[16:12:46] <haritz> and that file sets the following
[16:12:54] <haritz> set record = "+gmail/Sent"
[16:13:03] <haritz> then, in my .mutgtrc file, I have the following
[16:13:14] <haritz> macro index,pager gs      "<change-folder>$record<enter>" "Go to sent"
[16:13:38] <haritz> however, when I'm in a gmail folder, and type gs, it sends me back to the 'original' folder

[16:14:18] <flatcap> do you have any other hooks that might be interfering?
[16:14:21] *** Joins: adray (~araymatri@2001:470:69fc:105::1873)
[16:15:20] <haritz> uhm, I have a bunch of folder hooks loaded in lockstep
[16:15:31] <haritz> let me see if changing their load order does indeed change the behaviour of mutt
[16:16:35] <flatcap> ALL matching hooks are executed in the order they are in your config file
[16:23:04] *** Joins: sogens (~sogens@pa49-197-135-48.pa.qld.optusnet.com.au)

[16:24:25] *** Joins: sogens (~sogens@pa49-197-135-48.pa.qld.optusnet.com.au)
[16:27:48] <haritz> so, flatcap, like I said, I have a bunch of folder-hooks all looking the same
[16:28:00] <haritz> folder-hook gmail/* "source ~/.mutt/accounts/gmail"
[16:28:17] <haritz> and than that file therein "set record = "+gmail/Sent"
[16:28:40] <haritz> and then, back in .muttrc, after loading the folder-hooks, the following macro def
[16:28:50] <haritz> macro index,pager gs      "<change-folder>$record<enter>" "Go to sent"
[16:28:58] <flatcap> oh, I see
[16:29:14] <haritz> so if I open a gmail mailbox, and check the contents of the $record, variable, I see this
[16:29:33] <flatcap> when you create the macro, the variable $record is looked up and substituted into the macro text...
[16:29:42] <haritz> record="/home/myself/Mail/gmail/Sent"
[16:30:19] <haritz> but then, when I type the macro, it sends me back to the 'default' Sent mailbox, which is the one for the very first named-mailbox in the config file
[16:30:25] <flatcap> you need to escape the $, with 'single quotes' or \\ backslashes
[16:30:28] <haritz> oh
[16:30:37] <haritz> so it's been expended right at config file load time
[16:30:41] <haritz> rather than when the macro is executed
[16:30:41] <flatcap> yep
[16:30:49] <haritz> thanks a lot
[16:30:52] <flatcap> np
[16:30:52] <haritz> let me try whether it works
[16:32:14] <flatcap> you might need \\$ if you have "", so that the macro contains \$record (literally)

[16:38:40] <flatcap> dcpurton: np.  just starting to read through them all now
[16:39:52] <flatcap> haritz: hmm...
[16:40:22] <haritz> if I double escape it with a backlash, then it gets expanded to '\/path/to/original/mailbox'

[17:48:22] <apo> only... semi-related to neomutt, but how do y'all sync your imap stuff? At the moment I've got goimapnotify calling mbsync, and... I'd like to somehow fix that setup so I don't have to have my mail password in plaintext in the mbsync config *and* don't have to unlock my password storage every hour or so when mbsync tries to grab a new mail :p
[17:49:42] <apo> and just poking the storage every five minutes to keep it open would work, but seems inadvisable :)
[17:53:23] <apo> optimally I'd just have something like mbsync but open all the time, with IDLE and inotify? >_>
[18:09:50] <flatcap> bookworm: I've started putting some neo-bot ideas in Discussions -- all open to debate :-) https://github.com/neomutt/neo-bot/discussions

[21:41:46] <brjl> When I want to send an email, neomutt expects me to type it after the mesage I'm replying to.
[21:42:03] <brjl> That is, my signature is at the end of the document, I wish it to be at the top.
[21:42:19] <brjl> Basically, between my message and what I'm replying to.
[21:43:57] <flatcap> hmm... top-posting. microsoft may have made that common, but it's frowned upon in email circles :-)

[21:44:28] <flatcap> where you reply, should be up to you and your editor
[21:45:04] <flatcap> though there is a config var:  `set sig_on_top = no`  which you could set to yes.

[21:58:57] <brjl> I know that it is bad practice among mailgroups.
[21:59:09] <brjl> But it is common practice on business emails, so...
[21:59:23] <brjl> Gotta do what you gotta do.
