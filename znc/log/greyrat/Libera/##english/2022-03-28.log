[00:35:18] <edm> Yo, I read an article about the influence of german immigration (and immigration generally) on American english, and how it results in some germanic forms that aren't in british english - e.g. in AE you might 'meet with someone' but in BE you just 'meet someone'. Anyway, another thing I have noticed is in AE you often hear things like 'for supper i made eggs' or I have just read 'I made crabs' - to me as a brit this reads like you 
[00:35:18] <edm> are a chicken or a god or something, literally making them. 
[00:35:37] *** Quits: goppo (~goppo@user/goppo) (Quit: My iMac has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[00:36:03] <edm> I was wondering if anyone knew if this difference came from some romance languages (like french) having a common word for two different english words - e.g. 'faire' in french can mean both 'make' and 'do'
[00:39:33] *** Quits: rond_ (~rond_@90.254.208.190) (Quit: Client closed)
[00:42:27] <CuriosTiger> adm: In American English, you can "meet someone" and "meet with someone", and the two mean vastly different things.
[00:42:40] <CuriosTiger> You can also "meet up with" someone, which has yet a different nuance.
[00:43:00] <CuriosTiger> To "meet someone" in AmE means to initiate a romantic relationship.
[00:43:26] <CuriosTiger> or at least it can mean that.
[00:43:47] <CuriosTiger> "I was single for years, but then I met someone."
[00:45:51] <bullgard4> edm, You first supposed German immigrants influence and later French immigrants influence on American English. Both exist. But what's your point? Are you wondering about the 3 examples in particular that you gave, or what?
[00:46:47] <edm> bullgard4: just if anyone knows the history of the latter, and if it's an example of the same thing (e.g. a translation into english of a way of expressing things in a foreign language)
[00:46:56] *** Quits: magla (~gelignite@d536552c.access.ecotel.net) (Quit: Stay safe!)
[00:47:53] <CuriosTiger> People do literal translations into English all the time. SOme of them get adopted and become part of the language. Others are done jokingly.
[00:47:55] <edm> or is it just instead, for example, that 'crabs' is the dish rather than the animal, in the same way i might say in BE 'I made a lasagne'
[00:48:38] <CuriosTiger> There was a Danish TV show, "The Julekalender", which made fun of this.
[00:48:54] <CuriosTiger> One of the plot devices it used was literal translations of Danish expressions into English.
[00:49:21] <bullgard4> edm,  'for supper i made eggs' may be German influence, as is a word-for-word translation from German.
[00:49:40] <CuriosTiger> One example: "He who first gets to the mill is he who first gets painted"
[00:49:46] *** Joins: otisolsen70 (~otisolsen@xd4ed80b5.cust.hiper.dk)
[00:50:35] <CuriosTiger> In Danish, there is a saying "Første mand til mølleren får først malet". The literal meaning is what I just pasted. The actual meaning is more or less "First come, first served".
[00:50:58] <CuriosTiger> It exploits the fact that the Danish verb "at male" means both to paint and to grind.
[00:51:53] <CuriosTiger> bullgard4: It's also not just modern German influence that's behind such word-for-word translations in English. English is, at its root, a Germanic language.
[00:52:30] <edm> sure but it's not a BE form

[00:53:14] <huf> could have been a normal expression at some point
[00:53:35] <edm> indeed
[00:54:38] <edm> though i have read quite a lot of BE texts from before the USA existed and dont recall reading anything that sounded like that
[00:55:24] <LjL> does it work in BE if you give the eggs an adjective?
[00:55:33] *** Joins: wakeup (~wakeup@user/wakeup)
[00:55:37] <LjL> for dinner I made scrambled eggs
[00:55:46] <bullgard4> edm, What regards French 'faire' I believe It can be French and German immigrants influence: The Latin word 'facere' is translated into German to English equivalents of either 'make' or 'do', thus little difference to French influence. (But this is not gernerally true.)
[00:56:19] <edm> LjL: yes it does work in that case
[00:56:26] <LjL> uhm https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=I+made+eggs&year_start=1800&year_end=2019&corpus=28&smoothing=3 looks about equally common no matter whether i select AE or BE (though slightly more common in AE)
[00:56:29] <edm> and you would make or do a roast chicken in BE
[00:56:35] <edm> but you would not make a chicken
[00:57:08] <LjL> maybe it makes no difference, but I would say "I made chicken", not "I made a chicken"

[08:33:15] <chat> CuriosTiger meant to say: casualty
[08:42:10] <maxtim> what was that function you just passed, CuriosTiger?
[08:42:47] <maxtim> I understand the vim context, but I've never seen that call a chat bot before
[08:50:39] <LjL> bot just reacts to that syntax
[08:51:27] <LjL> i would vote for casualness by the way, if you have to say that at all, as it is attested, and casualty has a different primary meaning and the meaning closest to casualness is listed as obsolete
