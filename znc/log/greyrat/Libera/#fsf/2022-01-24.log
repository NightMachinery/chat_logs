[00:45:53] <zleap> usually video cards work out of the box,   with nvidia you need the closed source drivers / firmware thing to get the acceleration working I think
[00:47:17] <zleap> slackjeff, amd radeon rx550
[00:48:44] <zleap> ok doing a ddg search for "amd radeon rx 550 video card and debian" appears to reveal issues with the card
[00:49:46] <zleap> it does appear to need proprietary drivers
[00:51:02] <zleap> https://wiki.debian.org/GraphicsCard may also be useful (if using debian) however info may be useful generally

[08:46:00] <DiffieHellman> You can add your name as copyright to any new files you create. If you make any non-trivial changes (i.e. copyrightible ones), you hold the copyright to those, and you can then go ahead and add your name to the contributers - it'll only be accepted if the maintainers feel like your change qualitifies though.

[08:48:46] <jxself> You still do.
[08:49:12] <jxself> Thanks to the Berne Convention copyright is automatic. You get it just by virtue of writing your stuff, whether you put a copyright notice on it or not.
[08:49:14] <DiffieHellman> First, copyright is held, and not "owned"
[08:50:11] <labrador> Copyright is a monopoly on any artistic work by you libredev 
[08:50:15] <DiffieHellman> Programs written from scratch automatically fall under your copyright, and automatically become proprietary software unless you license it under a free software license.
[08:50:25] *** Joins: yik (~quassel@69-172-150-184.cable.teksavvy.com)
[08:50:27] <labrador> You get it automatically,but registering it makes it easier to sue people
[08:50:40] <DiffieHellman> Yup, you can register it as well.
[08:50:42] <labrador> And writing your name in a contributors file is not registering
[08:50:48] <qeeg> smh can't believe there are still people in this world who don't understand copyright *triumph emoji*
[08:51:08] <jxself> Everyone starts somewhere.
[08:51:21] <qeeg> smh my head
[08:52:10] <labrador> shake my head my head
[08:52:16] <labrador> Ah perfect engrish
[08:52:20] <DiffieHellman> If you make a contribution to an existing project, but don't have it marked it as yours, it won't be clear who actually holds the copyright for that change, but it'll be assumed that the change falls under the current chosen license as you've implied this
[08:53:09] <libredev> so what if i want to change the licence, do i have to email every contributor.
[08:53:09] <DiffieHellman> git kind of solves this problem, as each commit is tied to an email, and you can see who wrote each part of each line.
[08:53:24] <jxself> Yes, the license can't be changed without the permission of all contributors.
[08:53:55] <labrador> Or you could rewrite said parts
[08:54:02] <labrador> And license it under another license
[08:54:11] <DiffieHellman> libredev: If the project has someone who holds all the copyright, then you can go to them and ask. Otherwise, you have to go through the git log and see what part is covered by who/
[08:54:49] <jxself> There's a general process in here: https://softwarefreedom.org/resources/2007/gpl-non-gpl-collaboration.html
[08:54:51] <DiffieHellman> libredev: Which license do you want to relicense to another exactly?
[08:54:54] <jxself> Your first step would be #5.1: Identify all contributors
[08:55:21] <libredev> Even to the contributors who only fixed some typo.
[08:55:55] <libredev> GPLv2 only to GPLv3 or later.
[08:55:59] <jxself> That would be the safest thing to do, to be extra safe. And then start to wonder about copyrightability if you can't reach them or they don't agree.
[08:56:02] <DiffieHellman> libredev: Just a typo fix in the comments isn't covered by copyright, so that can be taken under fair use.
[08:56:43] <jxself> But by first trying to contact *everyone* regardless of the nature of their contribution you make things a little easier in that way by not having to address the question "is this change copyrightable?" which usually requires an attorney.
[08:56:44] <DiffieHellman> Are you looking to relicense Linux?
[08:56:53] <labrador> lmao
[08:56:58] <labrador> That would be funny
[08:57:29] <jxself> https://softwarefreedom.org/resources/2007/originality-requirements.html
[08:57:39] <libredev> 4,99DiffieHellman99,99: no, i know that's not possible
[08:57:45] <jxself> That can be helpful in trying to think on the question of "is this copyrightable?"
[08:57:54] <libredev> It is a ancient project
[08:58:06] <jxself> But as you can see it involves a lot so it's easier to just try getting everyone's permission no matter what. Then you can't go wrong. :)
[08:58:25] <jxself> Having too much permission is better than not enough. :)

[08:58:41] <DiffieHellman> libredev: If it's ancient, and not too big, you can probably give it a read and rewrite from scratch better.
[08:59:43] <DiffieHellman> Just gotta be very careful to actually write from scratch and not copy. If that's too hard to do perfectly, you need to get one person to read and document and then implement that from the documentation. 
[09:00:02] <DiffieHellman> Which program anyway>
[09:00:09] <labrador> Yeah white room engineering
[09:00:10] <libredev> 4,99DiffieHellman99,99: that will be going to pain.
[09:00:55] <libredev> Two people. Omg
[09:01:14] <jxself> Some may try to argue that with one person both viewing the source code and also doing the new implementation, that person is doomed to doing some copying of the original program, even inadvertently.
[09:01:47] <DiffieHellman> jxself: Sure, but that depends on the program. I wouldn't try that on proprietary software, as they'd get you then.
[09:02:01] <libredev> And someone also he have to document, that is lot of work.

[09:02:44] <labrador> Its hard
[09:03:01] <DiffieHellman> If you do white box reverse engineering, legally you're good, as you can show that the person who viewed the original didn't write the final, even if these are some things the same.
[09:03:45] <DiffieHellman> Sometimes there is a single optimal way to write part of a specific program.
[09:04:53] <labrador> yeah
[09:05:29] <libredev> Now i know why people prefer writing a program from scratch instead of copy pasting other code.
[09:05:47] <labrador> yes
[09:05:56] <DiffieHellman> Well copypasting other code is completely fine if it's GPLv3-or-later and you're gonna use that license.

[09:08:17] <libredev> 4,99DiffieHellman99,99: even if i can copy paste gplv3 or later code but how i know who owns the code so i can add his copyright to my project.
[09:08:44] <libredev> That is also pain.
[09:08:46] <labrador> libredev, you don't need to 'add' copyright
[09:08:50] <labrador> That means nothing
[09:09:00] <labrador> You just copy and paste
[09:09:48] <libredev> Really, I don't know that.
[09:10:17] <DiffieHellman> libredev: If the code is GPLv3-or-later licensed, you can just copy-paste as long as you use that same license. It's good manners to write somewhere where you got the code from though.
[09:10:43] <labrador> Yeah you don't need to attribute but its a good idea
[09:11:07] <DiffieHellman> If you copy entire files, that's even easier, you can just leave the original copyright headers and add your name below (which will cover your changes).
[09:11:43] *** Joins: yik (~quassel@69-172-150-184.cable.teksavvy.com)
[09:11:54] <libredev> Ooh cool
[09:12:32] <DiffieHellman> You need to attribute if you relicense, or combine with a different license though. If a file is MIT, you can't remove the copyright header and write in GPLv3-or-later instead, you need to add it below. 
[09:13:36] <labrador> Yeah but thats because the MIT needs to be attributed
[09:13:54] <labrador> you would do the same if it would be included in a MIT licensed project
[09:14:23] <libredev> MIT need attribution and gpl don't ?
[09:14:47] <jxself> Attribution is a different thing than preserving copyright & license notices.
[09:14:53] <jxself> Best not to mix up the two. :)
[09:14:55] <labrador> oh
[09:15:53] <DiffieHellman> The GPL doesn't require attribution if the code is used under the same license, but saying it's yours amounts to plagarism. 
[09:16:02] <libredev> 9,99jxself99,99: but attribution is linked to mit license i think
[09:16:23] <jxself> Preserving copyright and license notices, which is not the same thing, and the GPL also requires that.
[09:16:46] <DiffieHellman> Even if a license doesn't require attribution, you should attribute on relicense, as the license is the thing that permits you to relicense.
[09:17:05] <jxself> Because the person that wrote a thing is not necessarily the copyright holder (think of people that work for a company for example.)
[09:17:27] <labrador> uh yeah that complicates stuff jxself 
[09:17:46] <jxself> It shows that notice preservation and attributing to "J Random Hacker wrote this program" aren't the same.
[09:18:26] <jxself> The pieces that are required are the copyright and licensing notices, not the "J Random Hacker wrote this program" :)
[09:19:01] <libredev> Oh i see
[09:21:33] <libredev> So if i use multiple mit project i just need one mit license file with all copyright holders
[09:23:01] <jxself> Yes, that would be one way to do that.
[09:23:54] <jxself> But a centralized notice has its own problems. By removing the copyright notices away from the file(s) that the go with it can become harder to identify who has the copyright on what specific pieces. That can be helpful at times.
[09:24:14] <DiffieHellman> You only need one license file, but you should retain any file header notices and also add notices to each and every file, so people can open a certain file and know what the license on that file is
[09:24:50] <jxself> This provides a good read to learn the pros and cons of centralized notices versus file-scope notices: https://softwarefreedom.org/resources/2012/ManagingCopyrightInformation.html
[09:25:43] <libredev> Omg that is longer than gpl license
[09:25:52] <jxself> It's educational information.
[09:26:11] <jxself> And so yes, there's text there. Because it's attempting to actually *do* something by teaching. :)
[09:27:25] <DiffieHellman> Copyright is a massive pain to wrap your head around by design, yes.
[09:28:18] <DiffieHellman> Some people think it's acceptabile to make their license file this though; "freely distributable"
[09:28:42] <jxself> Such 2 small words immediately creates lots of questions in my mind.
[09:29:08] <DiffieHellman> Same, sure you can distribute the thing freely, but can you modify it? 
[09:29:53] <DiffieHellman> Some license say that you can distribute without fee, but don't mention distributing with fee.

[10:14:58] <leah> the 2nd one is how i actually think. the first is... trying to fit into a broken paradigm while saying what's wrong with that paradigm
[10:15:29] <leah> i think current fsf policy is damaging to free software in the long term. but the intent behind fsf policy is noble, and just
[10:15:42] <labrador> Andrew, oh yeah I remember I can get a subdomain for free
[10:15:53] <labrador> My mail server idea might materialize
[10:15:55] <leah> "hate" is a strong word, though there are true adversaries that hate the free software movement as a whole
[10:15:59] <Andrew> I don't think people would fall for proprietary software companies telling them to hate on the FSF
[10:16:16] <leah> i consider fsf, gnu, linux, bsd and many more to be the free software movement
[10:16:23] <leah> the fsf is a small but important part of that movement
[10:16:28] <DiffieHellman> Plenty did when they were told to hate rms.

[10:16:51] <Andrew> DiffieHellman: that's true
[10:16:58] <DiffieHellman> Linux is controlled by the Linux foundation, but you can still get Linux under the GPLv2 terms just fine
[10:17:39] <labrador> Andrew, do you only run smtpd? How do you get mail,you would need a pop or imap daemon too
[10:17:59] <Andrew> labrador: rsync
[10:18:25] <Andrew> the linux foundation sounds like a fraud
[10:18:37] <labrador> Andrew, oh simple life lol
[10:19:06] <Andrew> lol, I find it to be enough
[10:19:34] <labrador> Andrew, yeah I like features,like the roundcube web mail client is something I want to implement
[10:19:36] <leah> anyway, those are my 2 cents
[10:20:00] <DiffieHellman> Andrew: It's not really a fraud, it was setup to handle adjusting Linux to proprietary software and they admit it and don't deny that thn CEO uses MacOS.

[10:20:42] <labrador> The OSS philosophy was meant to be appealing to companies
[10:20:45] <labrador> Not to people
[10:20:57] <labrador> Companies cannot 'understand' freedom anyway
[10:21:09] <labrador> Saying that would do nothing
[10:21:30] <Andrew> *finally got his IMU (MPU6050) working
[10:21:33] <DiffieHellman> Yup, that's why I reject "open source" - but everyone is oh so shocked.
[10:21:51] <leah> binary thinking is bad

[10:22:21] <qeeg> isn't that a binary opinion leah?
[10:22:23] <labrador> Andrew, you like airplanes huh
[10:22:28] <leah> qeeg: yes
[10:22:39] <leah> osi and fsf are both very binary
[10:23:07] <Andrew> labrador: yes, but cockpits run nonfree software for the most part
[10:23:08] <leah> i think there is a nuance that exists between these two extremes, that is sadly not represented at all in our movement. the vast majority of people fit within that nuance
[10:23:11] <labrador> leah, I think an org must be binary
[10:23:16] <leah> and they are the leaders of the movement, collectively
[10:23:24] <Andrew> and i can't get sofis (free software flight display to work
[10:23:28] <Belgin[m]> maybe it's just a case of criticizing that which one knows better. in my opinion, apple, microsoft, intel, facebook, etc. are infinitely more harmful to computing freedom than fsf ever will be
[10:23:28] <labrador> Andrew, they do yes. But that software is cool
[10:23:32] * Andrew agrees with leah
[10:23:39] <labrador> Like really cool,its made to different standards
[10:23:45] <labrador> Made to not fail
[10:23:45] <leah> if you actually speak to people close to the osi, a lot of them are very similar to fsf people
[10:23:47] <leah> and vice versa

[10:24:09] <leah> there needs to be an organisation in the middle. but no viable one currently exists

[10:24:25] <labrador> leah, there's no middle ground for free software

[10:25:58] <leah> i say that nuance needs to exist, but i also regard some of fsf's policies as *conservative*
[10:26:06] <leah> their policy about firmware for example, makes many compromises

[10:27:13] <leah> i think the fsf should insist that everything be free, and not compromise

[10:27:58] <leah> just say it how it is

[10:28:32] <leah> that's why i say the fsf is too conservative
[10:28:46] <leah> the fsf's policies only apply basically to what's running on your main cpu
[10:28:53] <leah> or what is supplied by your distro
[10:28:54] <Andrew> have you guys seen the "FSF harms free software" LP thread?

[10:29:47] <labrador> Its a pretty nice tool
[10:29:50] * Andrew blows up his mind
[10:29:52] <Belgin[m]> i think ryf is just a way to get the ball rolling. i agree that the whole secondary cpu blob nonsense may be harmful in the long run, but that can always be changed. it's not a fundamental part of anything
[10:30:01] <labrador> Andrew, but its gui
[10:30:02] <leah> i sense that many in the fsf actually agree with my views, but are currently being stifled by rms
[10:30:06] <labrador> Which some here don't like
[10:30:24] <labrador> leah, rms actually made the free software movement,how is he stifling it?
[10:30:26] <leah> rms is sticking to his guns, sticking to the same policies as ever, refusing to change. it's a common pattern with him: stubbornness and refusal to adapt to the times
[10:30:41] <leah> labrador: this is answered in https://libreboot.org/news/policy.html
[10:30:54] <labrador> One way tho was his refusal to let people include gcc modules
[10:30:57] <leah> the policies criticized here are his doing
[10:31:05] <labrador> Which led to the rise of clang
[10:31:11] <labrador> Which is pretty sad
[10:31:18] <Andrew> then ill combine them with imagemagick
[10:31:30] <labrador> Andrew, you could just use gscan2pdf tho

[10:37:09] <qeeg> DiffieHellman, you say that, but to many people it ISN'T obvious

[10:39:04] <vivien> We need to draw a line somewhere about what we consider a computer (and thus requiring free software only to operate), and I think the FSF one is good.
[10:39:18] <leah> see, i feel partly responsible for the current problems
[10:39:40] <leah> my project, libreboot, set a false impression to the entire world, that things are good. they are not
[10:39:43] <DiffieHellman> The FSF solution isn't too bad for now.
[10:39:46] <leah> but they are getting better
[10:40:08] <leah> libreboot enabled the fsf to advance their outdated policies
[10:40:10] <DiffieHellman> Computers aren't yet at the FSF's hurdle. Once they are, we can go further
[10:40:16] <leah> but now those policies are "stuck"
[10:40:25] <leah> the fsf completely disregards levels of freedom that are now possible
[10:40:29] <Whistler> Still rejecting non-free software is nearly impossible in some parts of the world.  eg. I cannot even be allowed to enter my own home without identify myself with a nonfree mobile phone app at the entrance.
[10:40:34] <leah> including freedom at silicon level (see riscv)
[10:40:37] <Whistler> Its not just some inconvience.
[10:40:59] <leah> the fsf's current conservativism was enabled by the success of libreboot
[10:40:59] <DiffieHellman> Whistler: Your own home? What?
[10:41:12] <leah> i'm currently trying to undo that, at my own personal expense, because i want to advance the movement further
[10:41:33] <Whistler> Its for covid contact tracing
[10:41:36] <leah> current fsf policy is obsolete and should be rewritten to match the current times
[10:41:39] <vivien> Whistler, I think we can all agree that a mobile phone is a computer, and using nonfree software on that computer is really a bad thing.
[10:41:44] <leah> set a realistic agenda and go for that
[10:41:52] <leah> and revise every 5 years
[10:42:02] <leah> current fsf policy was written in 1989
[10:42:09] <Whistler> Or maybe more than that.
[10:42:22] <labrador> ok so basically leah you say that ryf is bad because it basically says 'all is fine!' when imporvements can be made,and that makes companies not push for further improvement?
[10:42:40] <leah> essentially, yes
[10:42:57] <leah> ryf sells itself as some sort of gold standard, but i regard it more like bronze
[10:43:04] <leah> ryf is *conservative* by modern standards
[10:43:16] <leah> fsdg is broken too, but it has always been broken, since day one
[10:43:23] <labrador> And the second one is that its far better for people to use a free OS with blobs than to not even use that free OS because it doesn't run on their hardware?
[10:43:25] <vivien> leah, I’m not sure I understand, how do you modify software that runs at "silicon level"?
[10:43:28] <leah> reasons are written here: https://libreboot.org/news/policy.html#problems-with-fsdg
[10:43:36] <labrador> And that no talking policy just further damages gnu/linux
[10:43:51] <leah> vivien: precisely my point, the fsf is still only talking about software as though freedom at hardware level isn't a thing
[10:43:58] <leah> the fsf is actively ignoring the modern world
[10:44:16] <Belgin[m]> vivien: i have a problem with that line being drawn between toaster firmware and computer firmware: is an airgapped computer running windows at the same level as a toaster?
[10:44:27] <leah> hardware freedom is now possible. its still in its infancy, equivalent socially to where free software was in the 80s and early 90s
[10:44:29] <leah> but it's getting there
[10:44:36] <leah> and the fsf is holding us back
[10:44:50] <leah> because they are not adequately addressing the hardware level, while still being seen as an authority
[10:44:58] <leah> so people's thinking is not being shifted to think more about hardware
[10:45:00] <labrador> leah, also why does ram training blobs not considered 'firmware' according to you? Its still not just data right
[10:45:03] <labrador> It has code too
[10:45:16] <leah> and people aren't discouraged or encouraged to think about it. they just aren't told at all, one way or the other
[10:45:48] <vivien> leah, the toaster doesn’t require you to change the code if it does not do what you need.
[10:45:58] <leah> labrador: because those are data patterns used by an algorithm to check for correct timings, and that data is simply more convenient to write as a binary
[10:46:03] <leah> in that situation, the binary *is* the source
[10:46:27] <qeeg> vivien, i mean, i'd rather be able to contribute to making a cpu better through writing verilog than not being able to do that :p
[10:46:30] <DiffieHellman> What if you're not allowed to change the source?
[10:46:48] <leah> seriously though
[10:47:07] <leah> apply current fsf policy about hardware, and ignore fsf's software policies, just look at hardware, and then replace hardware with software
[10:47:18] <leah> you will see a pattern: the fsf is saying that non-free hardware is ok
[10:47:25] <leah> and here i do absolutely mean hardware
[10:47:31] <labrador> What you're saying leah actually makes a lot of sense
[10:47:34] <leah> a thinkpad x200 running libreboot is non-free hardware
[10:47:41] <leah> *libreboot* is free *software*
[10:47:48] <leah> but the hardware is non-free
[10:48:03] <leah> and that used to be considered "ok" as a compromise, but now it's possible to have machines with free *hardware*
[10:48:19] <leah> but the fsf is still making that same compromise, ignoring the latter fact that is now true in our time
[10:48:22] <leah> again
[10:48:25] <DiffieHellman> Not really unless your got yourself a sand kiln
[10:48:26] <leah> fsf is behind the times
[10:48:34] <vivien> qeeg, I understand your point, but I also understand how that would not bother the FSF
[10:48:39] <leah> the fsf is *conservative* by modern standards, and holding the entire freedom movement back
[10:48:45] <leah> i no longer regard "free software" as the only thing
[10:48:49] <leah> i now call it the freedom movement
[10:48:54] <leah> the freedom movement includes hardware
[10:49:06] <leah> perhaps "tech freedom movement"
[10:49:15] <leah> i don't have a solid name for it yet
[10:49:47] <leah> *software* is no longer the only thing going on in the freedom movement
[10:49:58] <leah> the movement has evolved to include hardware. it's already happening right now
[10:50:05] <leah> and the fsf is currently failing to adapt to that fact

[10:50:34] <leah> that is the basis of why i regard the fsf as "conservative"
[10:50:46] <vivien> If you want to replace your CPU with a slightly better CPU you need to build factories and produce it yourself (how do you know wether you get the corrected version anyway).
[10:50:46] <leah> conservative means: resisting change, or thinking in an old way
[10:51:05] <leah> their heart is in the right place
[10:51:10] <leah> but they are behind the times
[10:51:19] <leah> they ignore everything i say on the matter
[10:51:23] <leah> others have said the same thing
[10:51:44] <leah> they'd rather talk about a freedom ladder instead :P
[10:52:14] <vivien> software is the only thing that’s pragmatic for everyday people to change, so I understand why the FSF would only push free software.
[10:52:29] <labrador> vivien, well yes thats true
[10:52:37] <qeeg> fpgas are relatively cheap now mate
[10:52:38] <leah> the fsf is obsolete, until it can adapt to the modern times
[10:52:53] <DiffieHellman> qeeg: To program the FGPA, you need proprietary software in most cases
[10:53:02] <qeeg> i have a fully kitted out MiSTer here for like, $400 or so
[10:53:15] <leah> they need to actually roll their sleeves up and get to work. they aren't doing their job
[10:53:18] <DiffieHellman> Once printers appear that can print out processors, hardware will be as modifyable as software
[10:53:40] <vivien> I think we’re really far from that point

[10:54:08] <labrador> Maybe a 28nm one
[10:54:14] <leah> evolve to encompass freedom in more spheres
[10:54:19] <DiffieHellman> qeeg: Sure, but that's just the instructions of the optimal processor layout.
[10:54:20] <leah> as opposed to just software
[10:54:21] <labrador> Probably can make a 96nm one
[10:54:29] <labrador> But the performance...
[10:54:30] <leah> why limit yourself
[10:54:33] <leah> when you can instead apply yourself
[10:54:37] <leah> right?
[10:54:39] <qeeg> DiffieHellman, yosys also does synthesis into bitstreams for fpgas now lol
[10:54:45] <leah> someone tell me i'm not crazy for thinking this
[10:54:57] <DiffieHellman> qeeg: A bitstream is arguably software that is applied to hardware.

[10:58:48] <leah> i'm serious
[10:58:55] <leah> look at hell
[10:59:00] <labrador> leah, do you get paid for the work you do at libreboot?
[10:59:07] <leah> they started like, 18 months ago, complete coreboot novice
[10:59:13] <leah> they now write better raminit code than intel
[10:59:14] <qeeg> tbf libreboot is basically just a build system
[10:59:18] <leah> often without docs
[10:59:27] <vivien> leah, to be universal, freedom must not come at too high a cost. Freedom at the hardware level right now requires you to own the factory and the resources, so it’s really not. 
[10:59:32] <qeeg> yeah see, i don't do well without docs lol
[10:59:36] <leah> and intel's own raminit is very robust
[11:00:12] <leah> mrc stuff works very well on haswell machines (hell is REing that but hasn't released anything yet, because it encompasses more than just raminit. it's basically a whole set of platform code)
[11:00:51] <qeeg> in FOSS, you either a smart fella, or a fart smella
[11:01:05] <leah> qeeg: hell didn't need money. one of the boards they ported, they literally took out of a dumpster
[11:01:10] <qeeg> oof lol
[11:01:11] <DiffieHellman> I prefer free software+farts myself
[11:01:13] <leah> brought it home, fixed it up, and ported it to coreboot
[11:01:19] <leah> it was a sandybridge board
[11:01:24] <qeeg> yeah but they'd need the equipment to do that with
[11:01:26] <qeeg> i don't have it :p
[11:01:47] <leah> well, there's a lot that you can do even without a logic analyzer

[16:00:24] <labrador> Ok
[16:00:57] <DiffieHellman> Wouldn't saying that you use LUKS just inform the glowies to not even bother?
[16:01:21] <labrador> lmao yeah,you're not actually telling a weakness
[16:01:55] <GNUHacker> DiffieHellman: maybe you want learn more about me, but sorry
[16:02:57] <labrador> From what I have read if you do not FDE your ssd,the only way to actually ensure all data is erased isto smash it
[16:03:19] <labrador> In case of hdd you can just dd zeroes
[16:03:19] <Andrew> why not dd it a few times?
[16:03:29] <Andrew> in ssds
[16:03:45] <labrador> Andrew, no won't work
[16:03:50] <labrador> They use wear levelling
[16:04:07] <labrador> No garuntee it actually writes your zeroes to the same place it wrote the file to
[16:04:07] <DiffieHellman> Andrew: Since a ssd has wear leveling, plus you can't overwrite blocks that have gone read only.
[16:04:12] <labrador> yeah

[16:04:58] <Andrew> same thing
[16:05:10] <DiffieHellman> FDE on a SDD mostly deals with the problem, as the files only go onto the SDD encrypted.
[16:05:22] <labrador> yeah so in the end you just forget your password
[16:05:24] <Andrew> "mostly">
[16:05:25] <labrador> And all's fine
[16:05:43] <labrador> Andrew, well mostly as in if your password is weak it could be brute forced
[16:05:44] <DiffieHellman> The keyfile header might stick around sadly, possible even old versions if you change the password.
[16:06:18] <labrador> Yeah unlike an hdd where you can erase it in a jiffy and perma destroy the data on it
[16:06:33] <labrador> Basically ssds are worse in this than hdd
[16:06:41] <DiffieHellman> Actually spending the time to recover that header is more effort that what your threat level should be.
[16:07:14] <DiffieHellman> They'd still need your password, but you forgot that because of all the stress :D
[16:08:35] <DiffieHellman> The last thing is probably discards. SDD's slow down a lot unless they know which blocks are now unused (out of the box, LUKS doesn't have discards enabled).

[16:10:03] <DiffieHellman> You can enable discards, but this isn't too bad, as it'll just show some usage patterns (which you could probably figure any anyway) and reveal what filesystem you're using (wow, he's using ext4! What a suprise!). 
[16:11:22] <DiffieHellman> It's a lot faster a snap a SDD in half than a HDD I reckon.
[16:11:39] <labrador> DiffieHellman, yeah lol
[16:12:42] <DiffieHellman> Post snap, technically all non-snapped NAND chips can be read, but who has the budget for that?

[20:16:28] <jacobk> duncan-nz: Yes, I think so. But, it's weird that the source code isn't linked from the scripts themselves, and the GitHub repo could contain some nonfree parts.
