[00:10:56] <theothornhill> My nyxt crashes when logging into mastodon right after entering totp code.  By crash, I mean the buffer containing the webside is deleted.  I see a small error message in the minibuffer that quickly disappears.  How would I best proceed to see where the error is?
[00:11:53] <waleee> theothornhill: launch nyxt from a terminal, possibly with nyxt -vvv if you want an exect trace of everything leading up to the crash
[00:12:00] <waleee> *exact
[00:12:08] <theothornhill> right, I'll try that - thanks
[00:13:59] <theothornhill> Huh, memory exhaustion. WebKit wasn't able to find a WebVTT encoder. Not continuing without platform support for subtiles

[02:05:37] * aartaka finally starts more or less understanding parser combinators after reading Pandoc sources.
[02:06:28] *** Joins: waleee (~waleee@h-82-196-111-63.NA.cust.bahnhof.se)
[02:08:54] <edgarvincent[m]> What's a parser combinator for the ignorant layman?
[02:23:49] <aartaka> edgarvincent[m]: it's a way to decompose parsing into small functions that are responsible for their specific part of the format, and then combining those small pieces into one big parser.
[02:24:23] <aartaka> Quite an intuitive approach, compared to other parsing ideas.
[02:24:38] <waleee> edgarvincent[m]: haskell hasa ton of libraries using that approach of parsing
[02:24:42] <waleee> *has a
[02:25:26] <aartaka> Having started this talk, I'll go and get some sleep. Have a good time, everyone :D
[02:26:53] <waleee> (said multitude of parsing libs is one of the reasons I think many research groups do compiler frontends in haskell)
[02:26:54] <edgarvincent[m]> waleee, aartaka: Oh I see. Thank you. That's why I get so many Haskell updates whenever Pandoc releases a new version (or is it the other way round ^^?)
[02:27:34] <edgarvincent[m]> spakoinai nochi!
[02:27:53] <waleee> no, that's on "I use Arch, btw"
[02:27:54] <waleee> :P
[02:29:15] <edgarvincent[m]> haha
[02:29:29] <waleee> (jokes aside, it's understandable why the current arch devs offloaded the building of haskell binaries to the downstream users)
[02:29:51] *** Quits: aartaka (aartaka@gateway/vpn/protonvpn/aartaka) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[02:30:27] <waleee> any update to ghc would trigger a chunky build of eg. pandoc
[02:30:47] <Plazma> oh god haskell requires so much
[02:30:58] <Plazma> it's as bad as all the npm lib requirements or python nonsense
[02:31:36] <edgarvincent[m]> (never really got that joke actually. Not sure what pride there is in running Arch. I use Arch because it allows be not to have to do anything about my OS, ever ^^)
[02:32:26] <waleee> Plazma: archlinux changed to dynamical haskell libraries, hence the final build of eg. pandoc happens on your own machine, not on the arch package infrastucture)
[02:32:43] <waleee> minus that last )
[02:33:14] <edgarvincent[m]> walee: Oh I see, that's why there's all this stuff.
[02:33:27] <Plazma> waleee: that sounds intelligent
[02:33:36] <waleee> the downside is that you as a user gets to watch pacman download a sh*tload of haskell libraries when installing pandoc
[02:34:47] <edgarvincent[m]> At least it's a relatively quick process, contrary to npm
[02:35:19] <waleee> ze offending line https://github.com/archlinux/svntogit-community/blob/packages/pandoc/trunk/PKGBUILD#L45
[02:35:31] <Plazma> waleee do you use archbtw?
[02:35:34] <edgarvincent[m]> I tend to avoid building npm programs because a lot of the time, it takes ages and ends up failing, for one reason or another.
[02:36:02] <waleee> Plazma: no, but I follow the developements in many distros
[02:36:06] <edgarvincent[m]> Which reminds me my Nyxt builds for Arch are wonky, and I don't know why.
[02:36:39] <waleee> edgarvincent[m]: do you get a class-star/class* error?
[02:36:58] <edgarvincent[m]> walee: Yes. But it works, and it's not dramatically slow :)
[02:37:46] <waleee> ah, maybe that was patched, I got a build error on class* a couple of days ago
[02:37:59] <edgarvincent[m]> I see. Wouldn't it make sense to do a dynamic build anyway? Isn't it the case for most packages?
[02:38:57] <edgarvincent[m]> No, the nyxt executable, while it builds fine, complains about having both libsoup2 and libsoup3 symbols.
[02:39:07] <waleee> many distros do a static build of haskell based apps since they usually do have loads of dependencies
[02:39:21] <edgarvincent[m]> But it only happens when I build Nyxt in a fresh chroot.
[02:39:48] <edgarvincent[m]> When I build it on my PC, the error doesn't manifest itself.
[02:40:11] <edgarvincent[m]> Indeed, some deps depend on libsoup2, others libsoup3.
[02:40:35] <waleee> ouch that's not fun
[02:41:09] <edgarvincent[m]> I don't think I've seen the class* errors, but I've been busy and, unfortunately, haven't had enough time for Nyxt lately.
[02:42:12] <edgarvincent[m]> Building pandoc must be hell on Guix ^^
[02:43:27] <waleee> well, actually not I'd imagine. Unless you overload somethings you probably get it straight from the binary cache of guix
[02:44:06] <edgarvincent[m]> I don't understand why it would work when not in a chroot. Hope it's not a malformed dependency cycle.
[02:44:32] <edgarvincent[m]> Not sure anyone but me uses those builds anyway.
[02:44:49] <waleee> which webkit2gtk do you put in the pkgbuild+
[02:44:52] <waleee> *?
[02:45:54] <edgarvincent[m]> I suppose. It's just that I remember that upgrades took forever on Guix.
[02:46:22] <waleee> edgarvincent[m]: looks like there's some lag on the matrix-bridge atm?
[02:47:30] <edgarvincent[m]> The PKGBUILD just specifies `webkit2gtk` which is 2.34.2 ATM
[02:47:52] <waleee> it uses libsoup2 according to the package listing
[02:47:55] <edgarvincent[m]> waleee: always is :(
[02:48:14] <edgarvincent[m]> I probably miss about a quarter of the messages sent here.
[02:48:28] <edgarvincent[m]> (or, if not, you all have really weird conversations)
[02:48:29] <waleee> webkit2gtk-4.1 may work now, and it uses libsoup3
[02:48:41] <waleee> edgarvincent[m]: hard to tell on irc :)
[02:50:01] <edgarvincent[m]> haha
[02:50:26] <edgarvincent[m]> let me check with pactree
[02:51:41] <edgarvincent[m]> there's webkit2gtk -> gtk3 -> rest -> libsoup2
[02:52:43] <waleee> webkit2gtk still uses gtk3, it's the one marked -5.0 that has switched to gtk4
[02:52:55] <waleee> *webkit2gtk-4.1 gah
[02:53:18] <edgarvincent[m]> Oh, I think you're right
[02:53:59] <edgarvincent[m]> I have webkit2gtk and webkitgtk-4.1 on my pc
[02:54:12] <edgarvincent[m]> webkit2gtk-4.1*
[02:54:19] <edgarvincent[m]> That's why it's working.
[02:54:31] <edgarvincent[m]> thanks waleee ^^
[02:54:37] <waleee> np
[02:54:49] <edgarvincent[m]> I don't understand webkitgtk's versioning
[02:55:12] <waleee> yeah, it get's a bit confusing when gtk4 was released
[02:55:45] <edgarvincent[m]> I need to tell the AUR maintainer
[02:58:08] <edgarvincent[m]> Let me try building it in a VM with webkit2gtk-5.0
[02:58:57] <waleee> oh, that should fail, cl-cffi-gtk doesn't support gtk4
[02:59:57] <waleee> the gtk main loop code changed significantly with gtk4 along with some other stuff
[03:01:18] <edgarvincent[m]> ah
[03:02:03] <edgarvincent[m]> hm
[03:05:04] <edgarvincent[m]> See, that's why I trained as a political theorist rather than a scientist. Things shouldn't not work. And if they do not work, I just should be able to make up a suitable solution in my head, and be very pleased with the fact that it's conceptually correct.
[03:05:42] <edgarvincent[m]> I don't want empirical stuff to be in the way.
[03:05:59] <waleee> haha :)
[03:16:11] <edgarvincent[m]> I'll try installing both versions of webkitgtk in the VM just in case;
