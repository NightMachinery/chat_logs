[00:01:25] <mst> first bug fix: 'prtotocol_tag' is not 'protocol_tag'
[00:01:35] <mst> second bug fix: I'd copy pasted the same fucking typo into another method
[00:01:39] * mst facepalms
[00:08:46] <vanfanel64> < mst > dude was trying to write a story about 'foreigners who aren't british' and then one of his examples was them clearly having integrated *perfectly* into the city they lived in
[00:09:10] <vanfanel64> This looks like a common problem, confusion between being a citizen of a country (like a british, french, etc citizen), versus having ansestry/genetics/ethnicity (what many mean, from what I can tell, when they say something like "I am Irish/English/French/etc") for a place. So going by the latter, an middle eastern person would not be british
[00:10:35] <mst> vanfanel64: it was more failure to comprehend that the culture he was being scared of was just 'london culture' but 'brown people culture'
[00:10:47] <mst> s/but/not/
[00:10:59] <mst> the problem you describe is a thing
[00:11:05] <mst> but in this case he was just a dumbass
[00:12:43] <vanfanel64> I honestly did not realize arabs were brown people, most seem fair light, not as light as those of full european ansestry, but ligher than people from india or africa, for examples
[00:13:08] <mst> he was an american in the UK, him seeing them as 'brown people' is just me shorthanding it
[00:13:33] <mst> I pay very little attention to skin colour so I may be inaccurate in my phrasing
[00:13:54] <tharkun> mst: Bug report sent.
[00:13:55] <vanfanel64> I see
[00:14:01] <mst> tharkun: thank you!
[00:14:22] <mst> vanfanel64: the whole point here was "to me, these were just londoners"
[00:14:23] <vanfanel64> skin color is not something I give a lot of thought to either
[00:14:41] <tharkun> You are most welcomed. Yet now you will have to teach me about beer. I overheard you have some nice pieces of glass where you happen to live. ;P
[00:14:47] <vanfanel64> mst, which sounds correct since they are people living there
[00:15:31] <mst> vanfanel64: right, and the point is - he went to what he considered an immigrant-heavy area and then got freaked out by behaviour that was standard across the entire city
[00:15:42] <mst> vanfanel64: it was that specific confusion that I thought was funny
[00:17:29] <mst> tharkun: you ever find yourself in .uk and we will happily tour the available possibilites
[00:22:04] <tharkun> mst:  550 5.1.1 <bugs-XML-Compile@rt.cpan.org>: Recipient address rejected: User unknown (in reply to RCPT TO command)
[00:22:21] <mst> tharkun: try 'bug-'
[00:22:29] <mst> tharkun: it's entirely possible I'm an idiot
[00:25:01] <mst> since https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=XML-Compile definitely exists
[00:25:02] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ Active bugs for XML-Compile ]
[00:25:35] <mst> so I suspect the likely thing is "either I forgot how the email things work, or the bugs- was an undocumented feature of the previous installation and doesn't exist on this one"
[00:26:10] <mst> tharkun: doesn't really matter which, try bug-XML-Compile@ please
[00:28:43] <ether> mst: careful - some people find colourblindness to be racist
[00:29:42] <mst> ether: those people can go fuck themselves - I'll happily supply as much ground glass chilli lube as they need upon request

[02:04:10] <vanfanel64> In the states, the left (and I say this as a life long democrat, from a family of live long die hards) is the most guilty of constant mis-using race as a political tool, constantly putting focus on race, race, race, it has led to cities being on fire when there would not have been any such outrage had it been another race that the media does not care about or could spin/mis-report the same way and agitate mobs with
[02:04:26] <vanfanel64> I disgres and did not mean to dive into a rant
[02:05:26] <xenu> it's called identity politics and it isn't limited to race
[02:05:43] <xenu> (or shorter: idpol)
[02:06:38] <rbraun> the issue isn't just idpol or the left
[02:06:53] <rbraun> it's just the latest tool of dominance exploited by a professional-managerial class
[02:07:06] <rbraun> and the so-called "left" is somehow dominated by them in the US, instead of the actual working class
[02:07:11] *** Joins: judabuda (kowbunga@kowbunga.thunderirc.net)
[02:07:34] <rbraun> for example, what black people in the US wanted out of the george floyd protests, and what corporate people offered as penance / PR were two totally different things
[02:07:51] <rbraun> it's almost like for every movement, there are two separate actual movements
[02:08:10] <rbraun> a real one that has cogent demands, and a distortion of the corporate world and the professional classes
[02:08:20] <rbraun> you see this in open source too; e.g. what does OSI actually even represent??
[02:08:42] <rbraun> the american PMC and non-profit industrial complex have become their own self-aggrandizing thing
[02:09:03] <rbraun> american non-profits as a whole have on average terrible accountability to their actual claimed goals, too
[02:09:51] <rbraun> there's a lot of good material on classunity.org from a working-class perspective, especially if you /ignore/ idpol as their primary complaint and look at everything else
[02:10:02] <rbraun> er, ignore their beefs with idpol specifically
[02:11:44] <rbraun> the democrat party leadership is definitely part of that world run by the PMC and connected to certain sectors, especially in the House, especially given their dominance by certain cities (NYC and SF), but the left-wing protest candidates like Tlaib (not sure about AOC anymore) are actually much more honest about what they want than the leadership like Pelosi
[02:12:04] <rbraun> and much less willing to settle for table scraps fed them by the PMC spin complex
[02:13:15] <rbraun> 17:38 < rbraun> you see this in open source too; e.g. what does OSI actually  even represent??
[02:13:25] <rbraun> i don't mean "OSI isn't pure enough like the FSF, therefore bad"
[02:13:51] <rbraun> i mean, what does the OSI actually even do anymore that materially helps the FOSS world at all, including greater adoption, vs helps make it safe for corporate profits?
[02:13:56] <rbraun> specifically in the last 5-10 years
[02:14:15] <rbraun> they are an example of an organization that is not fit for purpose, but that does not mean they don't have a purpose, it just isn't ours
[02:14:20] <vanfanel64> xenu, idpol sounds like the name of a new Quake engine
[02:14:45] <vanfanel64> or a cheat code from Doom
[02:15:08] <xenu> rbraun: tbh i don't understand people's problem with OSI, all they do is reviewing licenses
[02:15:18] <xenu> and they use basically the same criteria as FSF
[02:15:25] <rbraun> well, one of the beefs (per Perens) is that they have contributed to a zoo of licenses
[02:15:40] <rbraun> they don't anymore; e.g. that license Perens quit over, the cryptographic autonomy license, was rejected by FSF
[02:15:56] <rbraun> and they have contributed to that zoo instead of addressing enforcement problems with the existing licenses (like Conservancy does)
[02:16:02] <xenu> the main reason why "open source" is a thing is because "free software" is a terrible name
[02:16:06] <rbraun> because it helps their corporate buddies to have tons of loopholes in practice
[02:16:39] <rbraun> it is a bad name, but i'm saying OSI doesn't truly represent either anymore
[02:16:51] <rbraun> or at least doesn't represent the copyleft side well
[02:17:12] <vanfanel64> xenu, I believe it was partly to separate from freeware that tended to have ads or bundled spy or crap/sponsor ware

[02:17:22] <rbraun> the main reason it exists in practice is unfortunately that the corporate world didn't like copyleft, even tho they have worked just fine with the largest and most prominent copylefted programs
[02:18:04] <rbraun> and will use any change in license to try to demolish it like Apple did attacking GPLv3, even tho it made little difference over GPLv2 to them, they used it as an excuse to jettison the whole thing
[02:19:04] <xenu> i don't see how OSI contributes to "a zoo of license" and i don't see how OSI fights copyleft
[02:19:10] <xenu> licenses*
[02:19:12] <vanfanel64> Apple has attacked far more than the GPL, they have become way too big for their own good
[02:19:40] <rbraun> they approve licenses that are incompatible with widely used copyleft FOSS licenses, and that in many cases do not actually meet existing FOSS definitions, including their own
[02:19:44] <rbraun> vanfanel64: yeah apple is awful

[02:20:25] <rbraun> bruce perens' talk, linking for criticism of OSI and the state of open source
[02:20:28] <rbraun> weird title, but
[02:20:48] <xenu> in fact, it's extremely hard to create a copyleft license that is compatible with GPL without incorporating a literal "relicense to GPL" clause
[02:21:09] <xenu> for example, MPL and eclipse license are both incompatible with gpl unless you add such a clause
[02:21:20] <xenu> same with EUPL
[02:21:31] <rbraun> his argument in that subsection is basically: there are too many incompatible licenses, we're adding more, we're not enforcing the ones we have well, the community's funding and infrastructure to do so is not working, the corporate world likes to exploit loopholes, and the likes of OSI won't say where we really need to be using open source over proprietary sw, like in infrastructure and operating systems
[02:22:09] <rbraun> so it's just "rah rah open source good" without any sense of what that is or how to preserve that community and its assets

[21:34:12] <Grinnz> it's designed to get things done
[21:34:24] <shaldannon> also it has a massive well used and tested module base

[21:36:17] <xaltsc> I've heard/read of perl as one the most fit languages to replace *sh scripting (which I hate and plan to replace all my existing scripts with Scheme alternative atm, but maybe perl now ?). Is it true ?
[21:36:43] <Grinnz> it fits well in that case and takes a lot of inspiration from shell scripting yes

[22:22:59] <shaldannon> don't get me wrong, I like indentation too.  but using indentation depth to determine whick block or loop you're in is idiotic
[22:23:07] <shaldannon> *which
[22:23:23] <xaltsc> Yeah, for sure
[22:23:38] <shaldannon> which was why I was digging on python
[22:24:03] <shaldannon> then again ... Python folks seem to have a massive inferiority complex about Perl
[22:24:29] <xaltsc> why so ?
[22:25:36] <shaldannon> I dunno ... because it's an inferior language with stupid stuff like indentation-determined block scope and they keep breaking backward compatibility with previous versions ... so the users take verbal potshots at Perl to make themselves feel better

[22:27:28] <shaldannon> I'll give you the second half of your statement ... people have been declaring Perl dead for going on 20 years now
[22:27:29] <huf> people at work dont even shit on perl, they just look at me funny
[22:27:32] <mmlj4> <xaltsc> shaldannon: I like indentation actually, makes the AST clearer
[22:27:57] <mmlj4> dude, we all indent, but significant whitespace is a drag
[22:28:03] <mmlj4> but worse: YAML ;-/
[22:28:33] <shaldannon> hah ... was on some training earlier in the week with some dude who was talking about kubernetes config being easy and YAML being scary
[22:28:42] <shaldannon> I thought he had things the wrong way around
[22:29:09] <mmlj4> it's easy to read, but my vim clobbers it
