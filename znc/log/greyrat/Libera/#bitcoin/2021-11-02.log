[00:29:12] <ademan[m]> hrm ok so according to https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/49099/24624 I'm right, the transaction itself will look invalid to older clients. So i guess the backwards compatiblity must be at the block level?

[00:41:44] <ademan[m]> <ademan[m]> "hrm ok so according to https://..." <- https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/52153/24624 answers my question I guess, the serialization isn't actually backwards compatible, but the objects themselves are (and therefore can be relayed to other clients in a format they can understand)
[00:42:50] <ademan[m]> I suppose I've had an unwarranted mental model of bitcoin where "the blockchain" is exactly one (serialized) binary representation of a thing

[01:08:11] <Librarian> After all, everything that's been published so far says they're pretty good. So, what's his source that says they're not?

[01:29:17] <ademan[m]> thanks, I mean I'm not hacking on bitcoin core itself (I'm using it, via rpc). These questions are mostly to make sure my mental model is correct (it was very wrong until today hah) and frankly I assume most of my questions are far beneath the folks in #bitcoin-core-dev but maybe I'll lurk there anyways ;-)

[01:31:08] <achow101> ademan[m]: the format itself is not backwards compatible - it relies on nodes to advertise whether they are segwit capable, so nodes that are, will send the old format to nodes that aren't

[06:18:50] <Guest87100> How is it that on the lightning network the recipient can only make refunds? Not the sender?
[06:19:17] <Guest87100> Like if you buy something in real life and the product sucks you want a refund - so the sender gets a refund.
[06:20:24] <Guest87100> or is it because the recipient allows the refund?

[06:24:52] <MuhammadAllah> Guest87100 don't use Lightning, use real Bitcoin which is not refundable. Lightning is no different from Bitcoin BEP2 (BTCB). Lightning also controlled by one single corporation called Lightning Labs. Lightning can be the biggest scam comparable with the Bitcoin propaganda of the "Bitcoin Beach" where you can't even use real Bitcoin. Bitcoin become
[06:24:53] <MuhammadAllah> a brand to scam people which is very sad. Only use real Bitcoin, no sidechains.

[06:26:29] <MuhammadAllah> It's all true!
[06:26:29] <ademan[m]> I'm not aware of a specific "refund" concept in lightning. When a lightning transaction is complete, it is complete. A "refund" would just be the sender making a new transaction to send funds back to the sender.
[06:26:36] *** Joins: chenxuezhao (~chenxuezh@106.39.157.10)
[06:27:19] <Guest87100> I thought there was another refund mechanism where if the one person in the channel disappears then you get refunded?
[06:27:35] <ademan[m]> ah, that's somewhat different, that's on-chain in bitcoin
[06:27:45] <Guest87100> But you mean - A "refund" would just be the *recipient* making a new transaction to send funds back to the sender.
[06:27:58] <ademan[m]> right, hah
[06:28:00] <coco> You can't get a refund
[06:28:02] <Guest87100> ok cool
[06:28:07] <MuhammadAllah> Lightning is technically just a token what you can also exchange off-chain, offline. It is not Bitcoin.
[06:28:29] <Guest87100> explain coco
[06:28:36] <coco> no refunds
[06:29:07] <coco> That would violate the very essence of bitcoin's immutability.
[06:29:23] <Guest87100> right like bitcoin but there are cases when payment channels can refund based on time locks and HTLCs?
[06:29:45] <Guest87100> or if cheating occurs?
[06:29:47] <ademan[m]> Guest87100: every change in the state between you and another lightning node, you both sign a transaction which will send the correct balance to you, and your peer. This can be broadcast after a time to close the channel, even if your peer gets hit by a bus
[06:29:52] <Ara> It doesnt refund after a timeout, it closes the channel with the last-updated balance between the peers
[06:29:58] <coco> That isn't really a 'refund'
[06:30:07] <coco> The term is ill-defined.
[06:30:22] <coco> Ara has it right.
[06:30:32] <Guest87100> ok
[06:30:45] <ademan[m]> I never described this as a refund, I answered his question about that case...
[06:30:51] <Ara> Of course, any normal recipient of bitcoin is in full control of their coins and can, of course, issue you a refund if they wish
[06:30:58] <coco> Anyone in a LN channel can publish the last state of the transaction to the bitcoin blockchain to close it out.
[06:31:09] <Ara> But there is no mechanism to enforce this

[06:31:27] <AndyS2_> MuhammadAllah: lies. it's all (potentially special) bitcoin transactions, there is no LN token.
[06:31:47] <MuhammadAllah> What a joke. Lightning has nothing to do with Bitcoin! The very essence of Lightning goes against the security guaranteed by Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a clock, approx every 10 minutes a transaction gets confirmed. If you send a Lightning transaction to a merchant, it is possible to spend the same coins again, leaving the merchant without anything.

[06:33:02] <MuhammadAllah> you send a transaction offline, off-chain even, you can with any other backup wallet connected to the Internet very easily double-spend the coins
[06:33:17] <Ara> You really should do some reading
[06:33:21] <Ara> It is not that hard
[06:33:21] <coco> Lightning usage definitely adds layers of trust beyond what bitcoin requires.
[06:33:33] <AndyS2_> MuhammadAllah: the coins are locked in a multisig output. You cannot do anything with them that wasn't agreed on prior via exchanged multisig bitcoin transactions
[06:33:44] <AndyS2_> (that USUALLY stay off chain)
[06:34:09] <AndyS2_> how do you double spend if you can't even sign for the output?
[06:35:18] <MuhammadAllah> lol
[06:35:25] <MuhammadAllah> who told you that?
[06:35:42] <ademan[m]> the specification
[06:35:59] <coco> If you're cool with masks and covid anal swabs  I see no reason to suspect you're not ok with LN.
[06:36:02] <MuhammadAllah> that specification has nothing to do with Lightning wallets
[06:36:28] <ademan[m]> yeah know, why would the specification say anything about how it works?
[06:36:55] <MuhammadAllah> you can transfer them offline and off-chain
[06:37:00] <MuhammadAllah> how is that Bitcoin?
[06:37:24] <ademan[m]> who told you THAT?
[06:37:40] <AndyS2_> MuhammadAllah: Smart contracts via Bitcoin Script. It doesn't become more Bitcoin than that.
[06:38:06] <ademan[m]> lightning is off chain, that's the point. offline? lol that's one of the bigger criticisms of lightning
[06:38:23] <coco> MuhammadAllah, what's the problem with that claim? If you're passing a signed transaction back and forth? You can do that on a bar napkin. That's kind of the point of bitcoin.
[06:38:25] <AndyS2_> There are a few special cases that may allow receiving more money while staying offline
[06:38:49] <AndyS2_> haven't looked much into it, though
[06:39:36] <MuhammadAllah> If you connect faster to the Internet (or you reach a node faster than the merchant) you can spend the coins again regardless of any previously made signature.
[06:39:59] <ademan[m]> that's just wrong

[06:40:56] <AndyS2_> MuhammadAllah: have you considered that what LN is doing is just a result of using bitcoin script intelligently? Sure, some updates to Bitcoin have made some implementations easier or increased the duration of channels (now: infinite). but you wouldn't have been able to stop someone in 2009 implementing something similar to LN
[06:41:01] <MuhammadAllah> the wrong is making off-chain transactions with tokens called "Bitcoin" because that is not Bitcoin!
[06:41:01] <ademan[m]> AndyS2_: are you talking about https://twitter.com/puzzleitc/status/1299333496947736578 ? it seemed pretty limited, and not the kind of offline I think of (I'd expect the PoS to have an ok connection, and allow for unreliable clients)
[06:41:31] <coco> MuhammadAllah, to be fair very few people actually use LN
[06:41:41] <coco> mostly gays and Texans
[06:41:54] <MuhammadAllah> LOL
[06:42:02] <MuhammadAllah> Texans... gays
[06:43:41] <AndyS2_> MuhammadAllah: Do you even know how Bitcoin works? You don't have the means of signing a transaction by yourself that will spend the coins in a multisig output used to fund a LN channel.
[06:43:42] <MuhammadAllah> This channel is about Bitcoin and I think discussions about Lightning or any off-chain, sidechain should be forbidden.
[06:44:06] <AndyS2_> MuhammadAllah: doesn't matter how fast your internet is. you cannot spend those coins in ways that weren't agreed to prior to channel creation
[06:44:51] <ademan[m]> MuhammadAllah: that's nice, you can go cry about it, maybe do a bit of reading while you're at it
[06:44:53] <MuhammadAllah> The bottom line is that, Lightning is not Bitcoin. - period.
[06:45:59] <AndyS2_> LN is just (presigned) Bitcoin transactions that may utilize Bitcoin Script smartly and that don't end up on chain in most cases
[06:46:00] <ademan[m]> lol no
[06:46:21] <AndyS2_> if you want to say that bitcoin transactions aren't bitcoin, that doesn't really make sense to anybody
[06:47:32] <MuhammadAllah> Sidechains are chains which are unrelated to the main Bitcoin chain, your wallet simply send a transaction to supporting nodes which will CONVERT the TOKEN to Bitcoin and send it to the main chain. Lightning is NOT Bitcoin, never was and never will be.

[06:50:08] <Guest87100> Thanks for the answers above and entertaining and educational discussion. ademan[m] that video is interesting. How do we know the phone is offline or on wireless?

[06:52:04] <AndyS2_> ademan[m]: I'm not exactly sure what the recent offline payment discussion was about. It still seems impossible to me to receive money while a node is offline. What happens on that video is them paying a node while being online, but the coffee/beer machine is offline, right?
[06:52:56] <ademan[m]> Guest87100: That's kind of what I meant by "not offline the way I want" in that video, the phone is online, but the beer tap is offline. But the way it works is pretty straight forward. They pre-generated a bunch of invoices which will only work once the phone (online) completes the invoice with the beer tap owner's (online) lightning node. In theory this could allow for vending machines that are offline.
[06:52:59] <Guest87100> That is what I am wondering too AndyS2_
[06:53:11] <AndyS2_> Guest87100: I think the smartphone is online and pays an online node like normal. The cool part is that you will receive an invoice through the payment, and this invoice allows the beer/coffee machine to know that you really paid (what they showed you as a qr code)

People pay very little for the Lightning transactions and the Government ends up loosing Billions of dollars. Nayib Bukele is a dictator who removed judges from the Supreme Court etc. He is
[07:12:54] <MuhammadAllah> laundering money right now. A fascist dictator who want to mine Bitcoin with VULCANOS. They mined up until now, less than 0.005 Bitcoin.

[15:41:24] <linuxmint> the prob was the seedphrase being stolen, however I think I solved this with encrypting the seedphrase and storing the decryption process on the cloud.
[15:42:47] <dodo> waat? cloud?

[15:48:30] <earnestly> linuxmint: Also experiment a lot on testnet and regtest
[15:48:33] <linuxmint> dodo: yes, decoy sounds good too, but the thief has access to you immediately still.  Decryption slows and removes immediate theft of a physical seedphrease imho.
[15:48:58] <earnestly> You can google for testnet faucets to get bitcoins to play with, but remember to send them back when you're done

[19:51:40] <Mala> the article says: "Every pie will differ in prices by the city.

[20:05:28] <Mala> without any intermediary*
[20:07:39] <Mala> If I run a "charity" I want transparency. Not publishing financial reports for 5 years is a huge problem. I also don't see any publicly visible Bitcoin address which belong to the "Human Rights Foundation Bitcoin Development Fund" so audit is impossible. I don't know how about you, but to me this looks highly illegal.

[22:14:40] <satoshi> the topic on #bitcoin-pricetalk is "ClowncarTown".  Can you explain what is "ClowncarTown"?  Doesn't seems to related to Bitcoin.

[23:41:31] <satoshi> World Wide Web is where all the information you can see with your web-browser.  Internet is much bigger.  Many confuse Internet with the World Wide Web.
[23:42:19] <Guest2426> Agreed
[23:42:59] <satoshi> use a Web search engine, and you will find the answer to most of your questions.
