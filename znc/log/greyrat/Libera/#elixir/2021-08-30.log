[16:31:09] <benwilson512> yeah when I was a young developer I'd look at companies that built tools for other developers and go "That'd be awesome, surely other developers would make for the best clients / customers"

[16:44:14] <josevalim> OliverMT: eh, i don't think it was harsh. if someone is being congratulated on the new job, and then someone comes up, skips the congratulations, devalues the service provided by the new company, and start asking about pricing, it would be _at best_ be seen as "out of place". But if the person has a history of devaluing contributions, then it is probably worse

[17:11:48] <m1dnight> Stricly speaking, can one say that Elixir is a superset of Erlang?
[17:11:55] <m1dnight> Or are they two languages that have a large overlap?
[17:13:04] <Nicd> they are two languages that target the same VM. neither has all the features of the other AFAIK
[17:13:47] <m1dnight> Do you count beiung able to call erlang libraries from elixir as "not part of the language"?
[17:14:01] <m1dnight> I guess clojure isn't a superset of java either in that respect.

[17:14:20] <Nicd> libraries != features
[17:14:41] <m1dnight> Oh, what feature does Erlang have that elixir doesnt?

[17:15:35] <Nicd> at least parse transforms are distinctly different from Elixir's macros
[17:17:04] <m1dnight> oh neat, didnt know they existed.
[17:17:21] <tristan> agree with everything here but I'm still hoping fly.io pricing is explained by someone in that thread, hehe. I don't get it. sometimes it reads like a regular paas/host and others like lambda

[17:29:24] <josevalim> tristan: it is probably best to just ping support, i think expecting someone to reply there is probably unlikely 
[17:30:25] <josevalim> tristan: but for me the pricing is clear. you pay per vm per month. if it is 10 around the globe, that's obviously 10 different VMs.
[17:30:40] <tristan> yea, was just curious. i figure I cn find the same question with an answer from someone there on reddit or hn

[17:31:26] <tristan> yea, the pricing page is clear in itself, but then stuff sounds like it will automatically spin up an instance if a user makes a request from Australia

[19:13:26] <hoppity> How many database queries do you think are acceptable per single page load in Phoenix?
[19:14:00] <benwilson512> that depends on how fast the queries are
[19:14:20] <benwilson512> and a bunch of other considerations like how many users you have, overall load, etc
[19:14:40] <benwilson512> The primary thing to watch out for is N + 1
[19:15:13] <hoppity> no N+1 problem here, fortunately. But I worry that my pages take about 4 - 6 db queries to load.
[19:15:25] <benwilson512> that is entirely fine, as long as they are fast
[19:15:32] <hoppity> thank you
[19:15:37] <hoppity> yes they are fast
[19:15:44] <hoppity> what do you consider fast? 
[19:16:10] <benwilson512> varies but if it's under 50ms I probably won't bother optimizing it
[19:16:20] <hoppity> I see, thank you
[19:16:30] <hoppity> and that is the sum of all queries correct?
[19:16:41] <benwilson512> well, queries sometimes happen in parallel
[19:16:48] <benwilson512> so sum isn't always the right way to think abou tit
[19:16:52] <benwilson512> * about it
[19:17:01] <hoppity> then how do you know how long your queries are taking?
[19:17:21] <benwilson512> you know how long _each_ query takes, and you know how long the overall page load time is
[19:17:43] <benwilson512> for business applications with a low(ish) number of users, if the page load time is < 100ms I probably won't optimize it further
[19:18:00] <benwilson512> if any given query is < 50ms I won't bother optimizing it.
[19:18:52] <benwilson512> that's all baseline though, if a specific page gets tons of traffic, I might care about optimizing it further. If another page gets nearly 0 traffic and is a bit slower, that might be fine too
[19:19:08] <hoppity> I see, are these the numbers that I care about? https://dpaste.org/CMhY
[19:19:30] <benwilson512> Yeah the "Sent XXX in " is the page load time
[19:19:41] <benwilson512> do note that when your app is first started page load times will be higher as the code loads so
[19:19:57] <benwilson512> I wouldn't judge things based on the first time you hit the page
[19:20:26] <hoppity> you are right, loading a second time yielded 13 ms
[19:20:45] <benwilson512> right, and that's the full page, not including db calls

[19:20:46] <benwilson512> or rather
[19:20:50] <benwilson512> that is the full page including _all_ db calls
[19:21:03] <benwilson512> the snippet you provided is not showing the times of individual db calls
[19:21:21] <hoppity> I'll send it with calls now
[19:23:12] <hoppity> https://dpaste.org/bgaZ
[19:23:34] <benwilson512> yeah your queries are like single digit ms
[19:23:54] <benwilson512> this is all fine
[19:24:04] <hoppity> thank you so much
[19:24:19] <hoppity> sometimes the hardest part of coding is feeling that the thing is elegant enough
[19:24:38] <hoppity> and striving for that perfection
[19:24:40] <benwilson512> stick with Joe Armstrong's mantra: Make it work, make it pretty, and then if you have to, make it fast.

[23:57:37] <sc_> Hi, I'm using Nx to manipulate N-dim arrays.  I have a tensor with the following shape u16[460][2][3] which basically it's a 460 pairs of 3d arrays. It's possible to "iterate" over the 460 pairs and make operations over each u16[2][3]?  The Nx.map function iters over each element, but I need to iterate over the first axis.
[23:59:30] <sc_> What I want is similar to this pseudo-code: for i in 1..460; do_something(u16[i]); done
