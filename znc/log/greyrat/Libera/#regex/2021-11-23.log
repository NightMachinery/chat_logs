[02:36:35] *** Joins: alguien (~alguien@user/alguien)
[02:36:46] <VectorX> extra *? there but thats fine'
[02:37:19] <OnlineCop> Why is the lookahead in there?
[02:38:34] <OnlineCop> `\s{0,1}` is useful if you want to change the max range from 1 to something else, but otherwise... `?`
[02:39:17] <VectorX> I was trying to learn what the requirement was
[02:39:31] <VectorX> still not sure if this is dynamic or required c.c.c.l.c.f.
[02:39:44] <OnlineCop> Removing the lookahead drops the step count from almost 1500 steps to about 500.
[02:39:49] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/9m7Wvc/8
[02:40:15] <VectorX> sure, it was a slow process to get there ;)
[02:40:33] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/9m7Wvc/9
[02:40:49] <VectorX> you can change \s{0,1} to \s?
[02:40:51] <OnlineCop> Although I'm wondering what the requirement is for those extra "|US|AMERICA|TEST|NAM"
[02:40:58] <VectorX> god knows
[02:41:21] <OnlineCop> I'm just going off the "Expected Results" section at the bottom.
[02:43:54] <re101-horse-90> VectorX: Updated \s{0,1} to \s
[02:44:12] <VectorX> it should be \s?
[02:44:29] <re101-horse-90> I dnt  care
[02:44:42] <VectorX> which is the same as \s{0,1}  which means that could be a space or npt
[02:44:43] <VectorX> npt
[02:44:45] <VectorX> not
[02:44:49] <VectorX> jesus
[02:45:16] <OnlineCop> Specifically: `\s?` with a `?` after it to make it optional.
[02:46:09] <VectorX> if you have you keyboard at an angel and make a typo, you are probably going to repeat it if you try again
[02:47:34] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/9m7Wvc/10 because who DOESN'T love the /x flag when working with `grep -P`? :D

[02:54:05] <re101-horse-90> OnlineCop so what was wrong with https://regex101.com/r/9m7Wvc/8 , as it had only 500 steps
[02:55:16] <OnlineCop> Nothing wrong, but line 5 doesn't match the stuff at the end. I didn't know whether you wanted that or not.
[02:55:23] <OnlineCop> The "|US|AMERICA|TEST|NAM" text.
[02:57:57] <re101-horse-90> it was just a sample, that it can have any pipe seperated texts, which should be ignored before or after the sample
[02:58:26] <re101-horse-90> No need of (?: \s? (?<IDS>\|\S+) )?
[02:58:35] <OnlineCop> Right. If /8 matches correctly, then definitely go with that instead of the later one.
[02:59:30] <re101-horse-90> that's most efficient and accurate version of what I was looking for

[20:06:01] <OnlineCop> BinarySavior: Are you trying to capture the entire number, including optional '[dot][digits]'?
[20:06:24] <OnlineCop> BinarySavior: Perhaps like this: https://regex101.com/r/8piZ2q/2
[20:07:17] <OnlineCop> BinarySavior: Also, do you have to worry about commas? `10000` vs `10,000` or (depending on locale) `10.000` ?
[20:08:55] <OnlineCop> Like so: https://regex101.com/r/8piZ2q/3 (doesn't handle the last "locale" one since we don't know yet if that's what you want).
[20:09:41] <OnlineCop> Version /4 should be able to handle the locale one.

[21:04:05] <OnlineCop> re101-dodo-62: Did you copy-paste the Python code from the 'code generator' on the left?
[21:04:41] <re101-dodo-62> not understood your question
[21:04:56] <re101-dodo-62> where is this code generator?
[21:05:12] <OnlineCop> Bottom-left side of your regex101 link.
[21:07:20] <re101-dodo-62> no
[21:07:49] <re101-dodo-62> i didnt do this
[21:08:03] <OnlineCop> In your codepad.org link, it's complaining about Line 27?
[21:09:41] <re101-dodo-62> that is false
[21:09:46] <re101-dodo-62> yep
[21:09:49] <re101-dodo-62> but it is false
[21:09:59] <re101-dodo-62> the complain makes no sense
[21:10:40] <re101-dodo-62> if I uncomment lines 51-56 it works with the matches there
[21:10:58] <re101-dodo-62> if i also comment the second regex
[21:11:07] <OnlineCop> You're just looking for those `line.group()` values?
[21:11:08] <re101-dodo-62> but the second pattern isnt working
[21:11:13] <re101-dodo-62> yes
[21:11:38] <re101-dodo-62> also im really confused about this sintax I just copypasted from somewhere else and tried to adapt it
[21:11:43] <re101-dodo-62> but not really understood it
[21:12:47] <OnlineCop> Does line 61 print the 1st group value correctly? `print(line.group(1))`
[21:13:21] <re101-dodo-62> no, not at all
[21:13:46] <re101-dodo-62> but as I said if I uncomment lines 51-56  and comment the second pattern it works with the matches there

[21:32:10] <OnlineCop> We figured it out. It was using `re.match()` instead of `re.search()` which was forcing the match to start at column 1 instead of somewhere in the middle.

[21:53:53] <OnlineCop> Which regex engine are you using?
[21:53:55] <re101-snake-14> Solution: Issue is that ?o and ?e is also getting selected
[21:54:16] <OnlineCop> Right: `[^...]` will still consume a character. You may want to just "peek" forward with a look-ahead.
[21:54:42] <OnlineCop> `...|\?(?!\?)` would fail if the character after your matched '?' is also a '?'
[21:55:10] <OnlineCop> Some regex flavors don't support it (like sed, and vim's syntax is different) but most others tend to have support.

[21:57:45] <re101-snake-14> ok
[21:57:48] <re101-snake-14> let me try
[21:58:18] <OnlineCop> Note that if you DO have a `??` then it's going to match the last of those two but it's not going to match the first.
[21:58:20] <re101-snake-14> I want to ignore ? at end of word
[21:58:32] <OnlineCop> How do you mean "ignore"?
[21:58:36] <OnlineCop> Not capture it?
[21:58:47] <OnlineCop> Or... allow a single `?` but then match a `??` ?
[21:59:01] <re101-snake-14> i mean regex should not match ? at end of wird
[21:59:34] <OnlineCop> Most word boundaries (the `\b`) can stop between a letter/digit/underscore and any other character.
[21:59:43] <re101-snake-14> [^\?] this does the job
[21:59:49] <OnlineCop> It would help if you showed what should/shouldn't match. Regex101 link?
[22:00:09] <OnlineCop> Sure, but `[^\?]` will match the character after it, if that's not what you want.
[22:00:18] <re101-snake-14> https://regex101.com/r/nmGQNV/1
[22:00:41] <OnlineCop> Which ones should/shouldn't match?
[22:00:51] <OnlineCop> I see no '??' in the text.
[22:01:34] <OnlineCop> Do you want to remove ALL `?` except when it occurs after a word?
[22:01:40] <re101-snake-14> Yes
[22:01:44] <re101-snake-14> exatly
[22:02:21] <OnlineCop> Do you want the result to be "New Oct release?" ?
[22:02:32] <OnlineCop> Actually: "New Oct? release?"
