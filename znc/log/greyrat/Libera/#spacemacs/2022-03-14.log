[01:48:36] <FromGitter> <mabo3n> Hello all! Simple question I can't find the answer:  ‚èé If I navigate to a directory through a symlink with `spacemacs/helm-find-files`, and make a change to it like creating a new file, if I visit this directory again (with `spacemacs/helm-find-files`) through the symlink the file won't be there. I have to open the symlink with a prefix arg (`C-u C-j`) to "expand to its true name" (according to the manual 
[01:48:36] <FromGitter> ... (https://rnchzn.github.io/helm/doc/helm-manual.html)). Why this is the case, can I change this behavior? If I use the default `find-file` the file is there.

[05:56:03] <FromGitter> <armaninspace> I've been trying to get spacemacs server using tcp connections working -- tried a whole bunch of stuff based on the original manuals  https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/TCP-Emacs-server.html, also enabling dotspacemacs-enable-server and working with dotspacemacs-server-socket-dir  -- but could get anything to work -- is this functionality documented anywhere and if so any thoughts on
