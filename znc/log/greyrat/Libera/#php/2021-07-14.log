[03:54:28] <ash_worksi> I see, well, I was kind of asking because I am kind of trying to "find myself" when it comes to vim; I am sort of caught between minimalism and functionality
[03:55:33] <__adrian> you're doing work. don't chase ideals, just do what works out best
[03:55:41] <__adrian> you'll find the ideals you like eventually
[03:56:30] <ash_worksi> I seem to take a while longer than most -- but I don't want to poke the bear on this. I was hoping for some external input.
[03:57:13] <Blondie101010> when I'm just *looking* at code, the highlighting is more useful than not, but the changes that happen while I write annoy me a lot
[03:57:24] <khanred> Most people have much lower hanging fruit they could go after to improve their productivity more than switching to vim, it's a micro optimization
[03:57:56] <khanred> Most people's bottleneck is not text manipulation
[03:57:57] <Blondie101010> you can't *become* a faster dev by learning vim, but you can be one if you already know it
[03:59:10] <Blondie101010> either way, knowing vim basics is good for troubleshooting, but it doesn't go beyond that
[04:00:25] <Blondie101010> I sometimes have to edit files on hosts that are a VPN and 2 ssh jumps away, so in that case it is needed
[04:01:08] <khanred> I mean yeah but you don't need to use any vim features that make it special for such things

[04:04:08] <Blondie101010> some things are not always useful/needed, like multiple buffers, but in some cases I've used it to create macros that could do complex string replace with multiple buffers
[04:04:15] <__adrian> beyond that, trying to learn something because you think it's better will likely just slow you down
[04:04:27] <Blondie101010> exactly
[04:04:40] <__adrian> if you tried it and liked it, by all means take the time to learn it
[04:05:04] <__adrian> but also that's not the same as trying to figure out which plugins/preferences make it "good"  ;)

[04:24:51] <Sammitch> yeah I leared vi out of _necessity_ adminning a FreeBSD env ~15 years ago, and I continue to use it almost entirely out of familiarity.
[04:25:07] <Sammitch> and the fact that it is always everywhere
[04:26:47] <Sammitch> and if I wanted vim I had to compile it from scratch. uphill both ways. in the snow.
[04:27:27] <Cheez> well, 15 years ago vim was definitely in the ports collection, probably in the packages collection too.
[04:28:03] <Cheez> not quite uphill both ways ;)
[04:28:09] <Sammitch> it took a literal hour to comile though
[04:28:53] <Cheez> ah you needed make build -DWITHOUT_X11 or it would build that too.

[06:49:00] *** petris_ is now known as petris
[06:50:09] <gp5st> with myslq you can kind of get around it with load data local infile https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/load-data.html and the driver will read the file for you on your local machine, whereas pg expects you to send it the file
[06:50:12] <Blondie101010> I doubt you'll find equivalents in many other RDBMS
[06:50:37] <Blondie101010> but in both cases, you can simply do it yourself
[06:50:43] <Blondie101010> read the file, and insert it
[06:51:07] <gp5st> mssql has bulk insert https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/bulk-insert-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15
[06:51:08] <Blondie101010> if it's row by row as lines, then you do that
[06:51:27] <Blondie101010> or another may could be a simple string replace
[06:52:13] <gp5st> Blondie101010, but why do that when the database will take care of it correctly?
[06:52:28] <Blondie101010> that's not my point
[06:52:52] <Blondie101010> if you can find a Mysql instruction that does it, then that would be preferable
[06:54:01] <__adrian> i'm not clear - is this a feature of pg or of the pg cli client?
[06:54:22] <BadAdviceCat> gp5st, there might be a postgresql plugin for that.
[06:54:27] <Blondie101010> looks like its normal query syntax
[06:54:34] <__adrian> yes, but i'm reading some things that imply the latter
[06:54:53] <gp5st> \copy is psql specific
[06:55:03] <gp5st> it will read in a file into stdin and send it to the server
[06:55:11] <__adrian> in any case, the short answer is "because it's not in the driver pdo uses." also having some difficulty finding which driver is used and who publishes it.
[06:55:30] <gp5st> however, copy as i linked above is normal sql that can be run, you just need to be able to send the file over the connection
[06:55:49] <__adrian> then have you looked at blobs?
[06:56:15] <gp5st> it's different from a blob field
[06:56:31] <__adrian> is it the file _contents_ or a file descriptor?
[06:56:35] <__adrian> or something else?
[06:56:41] <gp5st> file's contents
[06:56:50] <__adrian> then why isn't it a blob?
[06:57:04] <gp5st> maybe we're not using blob to mean the same thing
[06:57:06] <__adrian> or, rephrased, how is it different

[06:58:07] *** Joins: LSD (~LSD@2.lsd.systems)
[06:58:08] <gp5st> when you run copy from stdin the connection gets put into a special mode and you write the file to the connection
[06:58:30] <__adrian> mm.
[06:58:43] <__adrian> so probably comes back to the driver not supporting it.
[06:58:53] <gp5st> https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.pg-put-line.php would work
[06:59:02] <__adrian> i see some articles about swapping out drivers, but i don't know much about that personally
[06:59:06] <gp5st> but, that's not compatible with the pdo driver as far as i know?
[06:59:28] <__adrian> pretty sure they're different, yes. that the function doesn't exist woudl support that
[06:59:39] <__adrian> *would
[07:01:22] <__adrian> in your place (and assuming i had complete trust over the file and where it lives), i'd probably write a shell script that used the pg client, and then invoke it from php

[14:56:14] <php-bot> aruns, If you have a question, please just *ask it*. And don't address specific people - ask the channel. If somebody knows, they'll answer. :) To get help more quickly, don't ask "can I ask a question," "can anyone help," or "does anybody use/know about foo". Be as specific as you can. Also, please don't /msg people without permission, and read the topic before you ask.

[14:57:13] <aruns> :P
[14:58:47] <Blondie101010> stenno:  indeed, it is not possible because variables are dynamic in PHP
[14:59:27] <Naktibalda> this isn't a good place to ask questions about OpenCart, there is a tiny #opencart channel on freenode, but it should be better to ask questions in OpenCard forum
[15:00:04] <aruns> It's not so much a problem, as it is trying to understand OpenCart best practices. We're maintaining an OpenCart 2.3.0.2 site for a client, and I see that on lines 89 - 90 of vqmod/@@vqcache/vq2-system_startup.php, 89 - 90 of vqmod/vqcache/vq2-system_startup.php, and 89 - 90 of system/startup.php, it is pointing to the wrong path for vendor/autoload.php
[15:00:11] <aruns> I just wanted to check if it's OK to modify the vqmod files
[15:00:29] <aruns> Idk what the difference between @@vqcache and vqcache is either
[15:01:52] <Blondie101010> ask them on their forum, as Naktibalda noted
[15:04:23] <aruns> OK, I will do so.
[15:04:56] <Blondie101010> without knowing the actual answer, I suspect your assumption is likely wrong

[15:19:10] <Blondie101010> the first paragraph on http://docs.opencart.com/en-gb/administration/vqmod/ seems to refer to your question

[15:32:11] <goddard> so i am pulling my hair out here
[15:32:28] <goddard> i got a development related question here
[15:32:30] <biberu> it's too warm for hair today anyway
[15:33:07] <goddard> im using github actions with docker compose and inside the action it creates 2 containers 1 php/apahce and the other mysql.  It never connects to mysql in github actions, but works perfectly on my system
[15:33:09] <goddard> what gives?
[15:33:20] <goddard> anyone else have a working example of this situation?
[15:33:27] <goddard> just wanna be able to run my phpunit stuff
[15:33:43] <goddard> Warning: mysqli_connect(): (HY000/2002): Connection refused in
[15:33:47] <goddard> always gives me that
[15:34:03] <goddard> biberu: haha
[15:35:45] <Blondie101010> then consult the person who set up your test environment with the github actions....  there's nothing PHP related in this question
[15:37:03] <goddard> Blondie101010: figured you were gonna say that
[15:37:05] <biberu> goddard: don't know, perhaps you can narrow it down by just starting to containers where one tries to connect to the other, without involving php and mysql, e.g. just netcat
[15:37:26] <goddard> biberu: thanks for the suggestion
[15:37:33] <biberu> two*
[15:38:39] <Blondie101010> goddard:  well it means that you're brain is able to reason properly, so that should have pointed you elsewhere

[15:41:30] <goddard> Blondie101010: im not really sure it is a docker issue
[15:41:35] <Blondie101010> though I wonder how you refer to the Mysql host if the container is different
[15:41:40] <goddard> because on my local machine it works just fine
[15:41:47] <Blondie101010> no it's a YOU issue, but with their application
[15:41:48] <goddard> its only on github actions it fails
[15:42:06] <biberu> goddard: how are you starting the containers?

[15:42:24] <Blondie101010> but how does the newly created container know what mysql address to connect to?

[15:42:47] <goddard> Blondie101010: im using the network config option in my compose file and my containers are named
[15:43:02] <biberu> Blondie101010: compose makes the hostname for the mysql service available to the php container
[15:43:21] <Blondie101010> goddard:  what is your exact error message?
[15:43:44] <goddard> just the mysql error cant connect
[15:43:48] <goddard> posted it above
[15:44:00] <Blondie101010> this could be so many things, and none is php related
[15:44:06] <Blondie101010> sorry to point out the truth
