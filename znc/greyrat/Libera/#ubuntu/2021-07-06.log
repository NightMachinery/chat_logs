[00:54:24] <pedrocr> TJ-: probably that, is there anything I can do to change that? maybe I should see what the BIOS allows
[00:54:38] <shimbles> TJ- the shell script is ~/.vnc/xstartup, and the command it runs is startplasma-x11, and the error is $DISPLAY is not set or cannot connect to the X server.
[00:54:40] <TJ-> pedrocr: this will give you a clue as to what it is: "ls -l /sys/class/input/input*/device"

[00:55:51] <TJ-> shimbles: startplasma-x11 is part of the plasma-workspace package on 20.04 ... maybe something has changed there
[00:56:36] <pedrocr> TJ-: indeed: "AT and PS/2 keyboard driver" is input4
[00:56:57] <pedrocr> and yet when the problem was happening the USB device for the keyboard was being reset
[00:57:03] <pedrocr> I bet the kernel is doing something strange

[01:00:24] <pedrocr> in the past I remember there being options for BOOTP and others for keyboards in the BIOS, but this one doesn't seem to have any
[01:00:28] <TJ-> shimbles: the changelog shows something that may be relevant: "Breaks/Replaces plasma-workspace (<< 4:5.20.4-5~) for split out files from plasma-workspace" for plasma-workspace (4:5.20.5-2ubuntu1) hirsute published 14 Jan 2021 19:14:22

[01:01:32] <shimbles> hmm, unfortunately i can't parse that. i see that according to these release notes plasma + wayland is not the default yet https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HirsuteHippo/ReleaseNotes/Kubuntu
[01:01:45] <TJ-> pedrocr: I suspect the USB device failing may be causing the input layer to have problems, but why it'd only affect certain keys is strange. I'd prefer to think the 2 things are unrelated

[01:02:30] <pedrocr> TJ-: yeah, maybe, I'm just wondering if the driver/firmware puts the keyboard in a broken mode and then the reset fixes it
[01:02:39] <TJ-> shimbles: I'm wondering if startplasma-x11 has been moved to another package that wasn't installed as part of the release upgrade and you're left with the 'old' version that isn't compatible with the upgraded packages
[01:03:46] <TJ-> pedrocr: I doubt the keyboard has both PS/2 and USB input modes. USB is sometimes used by touchpads.

[21:57:13] <punkgeek> Let me explain in another way. I have a debian VM, I'am suspect the sysadmin to stoling my encrypted data. So when ever I login to my system and want to decryp my encrypted partition, What cases should I check before mounting? For example, the sysadmin may go to in the rescue mode and add another user with sudo access, So when I mount my encrypted partition, he can access to my data.

That said, your question is beyond the scope of this channel. Please stop cross-posting. Wait for an answer in #ubuntu-security or try #ubuntu-offtopic.

[22:46:32] <goddard> is it possible to black a screen but not shut it off?
[22:47:32] <sarnold> goddard: xset dpms has several different tools for that kind of thing, though what they do to your device is dependant upon your device
[22:47:50] <sarnold> goddard: you can also just put up a big black window, some screen lockers do that kind of thing

However, the ip= command-line option is intercepted and interpreted by the initramfs-tools /init shell script and there are hooks to handle ip= in those
[23:36:21] <TJ-> punkgeek: aha, yes! see "/usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/functions" and the function configure_networking() where it translates a BOOTIF=01-aa-bb-cc-dd-ee-ff that is set by PXE boots to a corrected MAC address e.g. aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff then looks up which device name has that MAC address and sets the IP= DEVICE accordingly
[23:37:32] <TJ-> punkgeek: so you can 'pretend' it booted using PXE and add a BOOTIF=01-yo-ur-ma-ca-dd-re ss on the kernel comand line and moit a DEVICE from the IP= line and it should fill it correctly for you

[23:43:31] <diskin> Hi all, I was in a meet video call, when the sound started repeating and the system become unresponsive to mouse or keyboard. REISUB did not do anything. Powercycled and found nothing in logs for the moment of the crash. How to debug such problems?

[23:45:43] <sarnold> diskin: maybe you could make progress using a crash kernel to collect information when it hangs, but that's not the easiest thing to set up, and then you'd have to figure out how to do the kernel debugging. it wouldn't be fun, unless that's your idea of fun..

[23:46:05] <sarnold> diskin: it's perhaps more approachable to remove devices from your system one at a time and try to recreate it
[23:46:22] <sarnold> diskin: or perhaps if you've got 'funny' kernel modules loaded like vbox, remove those, and try to recreate it

[23:46:32] <sarnold> it's also not fun, but far more approachable if you're not good at debugging kernels

[23:48:19] <sarnold> another possibility is that your power supply just isn't up to the task; I've seen power supplies that were pushed too far, or failing, do things like that

[23:59:56] <oerheks> if that runs in your chrome browser, look there for logs? .. or wait,  logs aren't generated automatically. You need to turn on logging first. https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/6271282?hl=en#zippy=%2Clinux
