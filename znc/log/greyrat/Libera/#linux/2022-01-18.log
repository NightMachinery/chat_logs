[00:10:59] <Psi-Jack> Danilo82: your question seems incomplete or lacking much.
[00:11:28] <dragonmaster> Danilo82: what does it mean to "parse" a SQL file?
[00:11:48] <dragonmaster> I can come up with a meaning, but it's probably not what you want
[00:11:52] <KnowledgeShark> Danilo82; I don't have the .sql made yet. I used WGET to pull down the html which I was going to use bs4 (beautifulsoup4 w/ python) to parse to SQL using PyMySQL or SQLAlchemy. Just prepping (need help with linux file management / list management).

[00:13:54] <KnowledgeShark> Danilo82: Eventually; but thats not the question I have for you. My question is all the html files and folders I downloaded offline are in the 160,000 count. This locks up my file manager in Debian. I was able to extract the file lists to files.log. Now I need to know what command and syntax to use to extract only files and folders from files.log that contain "1611" in the filename and output them to 1611.txt/1611.log.

[00:18:11] <Dan39> KnowledgeShark: also rtfm, find has lot more options
[00:18:14] <jim> gothicserpent, you have a set of files that represent a database of installed packages, and there are dependency relationships between them, which we can collectively refer to as the package dependency tree
[00:18:25] <Dan39> like if you weren't searching for numbers i would've used iname instead probably

[01:50:37] <Danilo82> gog doesn't have sr3 for Linux
[01:50:49] <Psi-Jack> junebug: I usually recommend OSSEC, or Wasabi, but there was one other I recently heard about that was good. Problem with Fail2Ban is, it's ridiculous to setup and is just a singular system and not networked or interlinked with anything but itself, which is useless in a fleet of servers.
[01:50:58] <Psi-Jack> Danilo82: Correct. get over it.
[01:51:00] <Psi-Jack> Move along.
[01:51:08] <junebug> Psi-Jack, I only have 1 server
[01:51:29] <junebug> And it's already installed for a few years on this system
[01:51:37] <Psi-Jack> It's also heavy on memory for so little.

[04:36:34] <ayecee> Guest84: the kernel can be compiled with a default commandline that includes a rootfs= parameter.
[04:36:40] <ayecee> domicron: it does provide ldap.

[04:36:50] <domicron> oh really
[04:36:58] <Psi-Jack> Samba 4 and up does anyway.

[04:37:10] <Psi-Jack> domicron: So does any LDAP.
[04:37:16] <Guest84> ayecee okay, here's the full story: there's a filesystem, created by a tool called buildroot. it is compiled into the kernel and then the kernel is loaded via an external loader (a luma3ds payload, if you're curious). the entire filesystem is readonly. what I'd like to do is to automount a partition onto / when the kernel is loaded

[07:24:33] <UPXTcgv7> Sudo is from distributions like Ubuntu.  If unpacking the tar/tar.gz/tar.xz does not work, it does not look good for most users in my opinion.  Without a package installer, there might be problems depending on what one means by that.  For instance, I do not need to use Puppy Package Manager to install (or try to install) programs.  Sometimes I can download them off the internet or repositories, and then let the software unpack and "install" it.  Things
[07:24:34] <UPXTcgv7> could also be unpacked and used in temporary places like RAM and do not have to have the components in /usr/, /bin/, /etc/, /root/, and so on.

[08:40:26] <pnbeast> It's not hard to troubleshoot, AssKoala, it's that you see a "bog standard" command failing, maybe in the middle of a script, and don't think to check whether it's an alias, to find out what part of the alias has failed.

[11:28:47] <labrador> When I said check,that meant a gpg --edit-key uid and then a check.
[11:28:59] <labrador> So what gives?

That is, they were new a couple years ago, have been mounted etc, but really haven't been used until now. Per kernel.org, "Once it's determined that ATA bus errors have possibly occurred, lowering ATA bus transmission speed is one of actions which may alleviate the problem. " How can i do that?

[13:37:41] <horseface> wow
[13:37:42] <hexnewbie> horseface: Not exactly, but the delta algorithm, particularly with --inplace, might. That means the initial transfer used --partial, and also BE WARNED that --inplace breaks hardlinks very badly, so it cannot be combined with rsnapshot, rsync --linkdest or any form of backup that used cp -al

You're probably better off using the version provided by your distro, by your requirements, or whichever version supports the features you need.

[16:16:00] <Gaboradon> I think it didn't do that on other distros, running in opensuse now, or something changed in an update.
[16:16:27] <koollman> fdisk -l /dev/sd? , may be what you want
[16:16:31] <Gaboradon> I was using kubuntu for a year and I don't remember the output being unordered like this, maybe I didn't pay attention
[16:16:40] <koollman> or more likely, lsblk or something else
[16:17:03] <hexnewbie> To rephrase it, I see the theoretical need (and given my natural urge to over-engineering, I'd have also added such feature), but the cases where you didn't mean ‘lsblk’ or ‘fdisk -l /dev/sdx’ instead is vanishingly small.

[16:57:50] <Gaboradon> Well at least I think, as for /dev/sdX ordering,  after sda boot drive, sata 1 does start with sdb, and sata 2 with sdc so if I had my boot drive on sata 1 then these block ids might line up, but yes they're not stable and shouldn't be relied upon, I trashed one gaming disk once when I dd zero the first gig by mistaken sdX

[17:01:19] <Dagmar> ssh-keyscan is handy because it's an easy way to get all of them at a go
[17:01:57] <chilversc> koollman: because its useful to be able to fetch that information via a trusted channel such as https so you can verify the fingerprint, otherwise how else are you supposed to verify it?
[17:02:03] <Dagmar> THEN if they abandon one of the keys on the far end, you can still connect by verifying against one of the other keys you've got, and the new one can be safely added
[17:02:27] <chilversc> Dagmar: in this case that wouldn't have helped, since they've all changed
[17:02:31] <Dagmar> chilversc: Honestly for most people it's a matter of "it's the same host I've always been connecting to"
[17:02:43] <hexnewbie> Well, yeah, I use ssh-keyscan + ssh-keygen to do complex juggling and paranoid verification for automation. Like, I additionally ensure that no *other* host has that fingerprint, also. Manually hash all the *other* hostnames of the same machine, etc.
[17:03:21] <chilversc> Dagmar: right, but how do you know its the same same host? The only proof is the host fingerprint, or some externally verified trust chain such as TLS certificates
[17:03:40] <Dagmar> If the fingerprint hasn't changed in the last five years, then it's probably the same host
[17:03:53] <Dagmar> ...or rather if the key hasn't changed
[17:04:18] <chilversc> right, but in this case all the fingerprints just changed on me, so I thought rather than having to compare by hand, there would obviously be a simple way to add a known key (that you've got from some other secure channel) to the known_hosts file
[17:04:26] <Dagmar> And there's also DNS.
[17:04:29] <Dagmar> Ahem.
[17:04:53] <Dagmar> Call the admin up and demand they read the fingerprint of the key to you over the phone then
[17:05:07] <chilversc> I doubt anyone has gone through the effort to set up some kind of secure DNS record
[17:05:15] <Dagmar> You would be wrong.
[17:05:27] <hexnewbie> chilversc: There s a simple way to add a known key. But 1) a fingerprint *IS NOT* a key, 2) it's more keystrokes than checking said fingerprint during automated adding (by the virtue of the automation usually being faster, etc.)

[17:08:46] <renard> Hello! I'm trying to setup a tvheadend instance on my NAS, but armbian doesn't seem to load the dib0700 firmware for my usb sony playtv card. Nothing in syslog or dmesg, but lsusb does show the usb device. Any idea what steps I could take to try and debug that?
[17:09:17] <mar77i> hmm. do chars in globs like '[a-b]' have to be of the same character class (lower/upper/digits) or can they go across them, something like '[0-z]'?
[17:09:40] <Dagmar> mar77i: Sure, if you don't mind bizarre and inexplicable effects
[17:09:42] <renard> It's supposed to work since kernel 2.6.30 and I'm on 5.10.60-mvebu armv7l

[17:09:58] <hexnewbie> renard: Not familiar with your specific situation, but if it doesn't *try* to load the firmware (hence no errors), it sounds like either the driver isn't there or nothing is loading it
[17:10:21] <hexnewbie> Cause firmware isn't just loaded, it's used by the driver

[17:11:08] <renard> I've try manually adding the fw in /lib like so: https://linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/Sony_PlayTV_dual_tuner_DVB-T#Firmware (no changes), btw
[17:11:10] <Dagmar> It's valid if the charset is ASCII
[17:11:12] <renard> hmm
[17:11:20] <Dagmar> ...but that's making an assumption about charsets and a few other things.
[17:11:23] <mar77i> Dagmar: at least, these would have wildly varying effects in different encodings, and I would personally want to stay clear from that. hm. and then there's scandinavian umlauts
[17:11:27] <peetaur> mar77i: I wouldn't use things like that...maybe it would get broken on another platform. I can't think of any relevant ones...like as400/os400 isn't relevant, is it?
[17:11:27] <hexnewbie> Can't use [0-z], because it will match :;<=>?@
[17:11:47] <Dagmar> mar77i: So don't mix character classes, then
[17:11:55] <mar77i> hexnewbie: in ascii, yes. don't ask me what's the effect in ebdic
[17:12:03] <Dagmar> hexnewbie: Maybe they want to match a whole bunch of stuff
[17:12:09] <peetaur> hexnewbie: if you want those things, then you can ....but yeah why would you...
[17:12:28] <Dagmar> Pffft... If you're on a system that uses EBCDIC I would think the bigger problem would be the liver failure
[17:12:46] <mar77i> so implementing it I'll disregard unicode for now and choose class strings (alpha/ALPHA/digit) internally.

[19:38:00] <djph> Note that rsync always verifies that each transferred file was correctly reconstructed on the receiving side by checking a whole-file checksum that is generated as the file is trans-ferred, but that automatic after-the-transfer verification has nothing to do with this option's before-the-transfer "Does this file need to be updated?" check. <-- from the rsync manpage (specifically under '--checksum')

[20:38:58] <akik> labrador: x.org has a resolution property which you were able to use to scale items
[20:38:58] <rpnx-phone> Apple does?
[20:38:59] <evilop> eg 4k on a 13" gives you 160dpi with a 2x scaling
[20:39:06] <evilop> which is generally fine
[20:39:15] <rpnx-phone> Unless the screen is a multiple of the original scaling?
