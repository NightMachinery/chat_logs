[05:43:13] <MusicalDillo> did you make it to the drum circle?
[05:43:48] <morlog> yep
[05:44:36] <MusicalDillo> got out on the bicycle to ride to Wally's earlier and was fighting 14mph head winds
[05:44:52] <MusicalDillo> had to gear down
[05:45:16] <morlog> i once rode about 700 miles into a headwind like that
[05:45:27] <morlog> chose the wrong route for that time of year
[05:46:59] <MusicalDillo> yipes
[05:47:16] <MusicalDillo> that'll keep your legs exercised
[05:47:45] <morlog> had to cut that trip short because i wore out all the bearings on the bike and trailer
[05:47:53] <MusicalDillo> wow
[05:48:21] <morlog> i rebuilt that bike, its up in arkansas right now
[05:48:32] <morlog> its a farm bike now

[05:49:06] <MusicalDillo> you herd sheep with it?

[05:49:13] <MusicalDillo> ok
[05:49:24] <MusicalDillo> nice
[05:49:44] <morlog> front rack on it is rated for 100lbs, rear rack is a custom one i built that can handle a couple hundred pounds
[05:49:53] <morlog> geared really low
[05:50:03] <MusicalDillo> what a great idea
[05:50:26] <MusicalDillo> my rear rack and saddle bags will do 100
[05:51:05] <MusicalDillo> never considered that a bicycle could be useful on a farm
[05:51:13] <morlog> i combined a couple of racks so that they wrapped around the rear wheel and then reinforced their mounts
[05:51:27] <MusicalDillo> sounds like a Chinese thing
[05:51:36] <MusicalDillo> cool
[05:51:44] <morlog> yeah, got a lot of comments like that when i rode it
[05:53:31] <morlog> 6GB's left on my hotspot and 1 day left in my billing cycle
[05:54:31] <MusicalDillo> is that a good thing?
