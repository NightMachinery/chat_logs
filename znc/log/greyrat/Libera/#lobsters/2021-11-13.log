[08:43:39] <dmc> anyone else here bombard themselves with GitHub notifications?
[08:44:16] <dmc> if I leave zero unread notifications before I go to sleep, I wake up to like 150
[08:46:47] <cd> I have a fairly active OSS game's repos set to notify me, so pretty much yep
[08:46:53] <cd> i only wake up to like 30-50 notifs though

[08:48:31] <cd> No, only one game
[08:48:35] <cd> Space Station 14 in this case.
[08:48:52] <imode> how's that effort coming along.
[08:49:19] <cd> imode: Fully playable, albeit missing content, and has an active playerbase

[08:51:46] <cd> Yea, a new map was just merged today (making it SS14's second ever full station. Yay!), and it's just been bug hunting all day.
[08:52:40] <cd> and I think the worst of the bugs found is just the occasional lag spike. (Saltern, a station about 1/2 Packed's size, is lag-free)
[08:53:38] <cd> we made front page on The Other Site (HN) a few days ago. unfortunate that every user that i'm aware of that came from HN is kinda... noisy?
[08:54:08] <imode> sounds 'bout right.
[08:54:20] <cd> Had someone complaining about midnight commander not liking the game's .zip. (which is an issue with mc, it's not respecting permissions info-zip does)
[08:54:39] <cd> pinned it squarely on us when we have no control over mc having a bad unzip.

[18:53:41] <riv> its weird that it puts {"e"=>"foo"} into the search box, but is there likely to be an issue here?
[18:56:35] <pushcx> Probably not. It's happening because Rails sees the 'q[e]=foo' as encoding a map. The search code calls .to_s on the param, which flattens it down to the string for the db. It's still treated as untrusted user input from there.

[20:46:59] <bsandro> with macos you cannot use external-only if the lid is open, you cannot use external open if lid is closed but power source is battery (it suspends), and before you couldn't even disable suspend on closing the lid with no external display
[20:47:29] <bsandro> so aliexpress had that funny hdmi dongles that simulated an external display just so laptop doesn't go to sleep
[20:47:56] <bsandro> and another magnetic devices that simulated closed lid to have internal display powered off if the lid is open
[20:48:07] <jlindgren> modern problems require hacky solutions
[20:48:46] <jlindgren> that is interesting though - i used to always set my work laptop to not sleep so i could just close it and carry to conference rooms etc. the fact that that isn't possible (or maybe it is now?) is kind of astonishing
