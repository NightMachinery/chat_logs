[00:04:20] <ii14[m]> you don't need to setup anything
[00:04:28] <ii14[m]> `:term` and just run it
[00:04:34] <ii14[m]> from shell
[00:04:53] <ii14[m]> or `:term python3 whatever.py`
[00:05:28] <RudrrayanManna[m> ok let me try that
[00:05:29] <RudrrayanManna[m> one sec
[00:05:45] <RudrrayanManna[m> is :term the same as :terminal?
[00:05:50] <RudrrayanManna[m> i think so 
[00:06:47] <ii14[m]> yes
[00:07:07] <RudrrayanManna[m> yeah this works i think!
[00:07:08] <RudrrayanManna[m> but
[00:07:11] <ii14[m]> you can even do just `:te`
[00:07:16] <RudrrayanManna[m> dang
[00:07:32] <RudrrayanManna[m> RudrrayanManna[m: could you make the terminal take up the bottom part of the window?
[00:07:38] <clason[m]> sure
[00:07:42] <RudrrayanManna[m> instead of completely covering the screen?
[00:07:57] <clason[m]> `:belowright split | term`
[00:08:00] <ii14[m]> `:sp te python3 ...`
[00:08:10] <ii14[m]> maybe something changed though
[00:08:27] <RudrrayanManna[m> clason[m]: ill try adding that
[00:08:27] <clason[m]> split
[00:08:27] <RudrrayanManna[m> whats :sp
[00:08:31] <ii14[m]> I'm on slightly older version
[00:08:36] <ii14[m]> :sp = :split, :vs = :vsplit
[00:08:39] <RudrrayanManna[m> clason[m]: wow I never knew these short forms existed lmao
[00:08:43] <clason[m]> (that worked for basically ever)
[00:08:46] <RudrrayanManna[m> ive always used the longer ones 
[00:09:06] <ii14[m]> you can shorten most commands
[00:09:44] <ii14[m]> my bad, `:vs te` doesn't work

[00:10:08] <RudrrayanManna[m> nmap <F5> :wa <CR> :sp te python3 %
[00:10:08] <RudrrayanManna[m> this wouldnt work then?

[00:11:26] <ii14[m]> sure
[00:11:27] <RudrrayanManna[m> the split kind of takes up half the screen 
[00:11:47] <RudrrayanManna[m> should I use :horizontal resize or something?
[00:12:07] <ii14[m]> `:sp term://python3 % | resize 10`
[00:12:08] <clason[m]> you can add a number
[00:12:26] <RudrrayanManna[m> nmap <F5> :wa <CR> :sp term://python3 % <bar> :horizontal resize -50
[00:12:26] <RudrrayanManna[m> would this work?
[00:12:26] <clason[m]> like `:30sp`
[00:12:31] <ii14[m]> oh right, you can do `:10sp ...`
[00:12:32] <clason[m]> (adjust to taste)
[00:13:13] <ii14[m]> `:resize` is horizontal be default, vertical resize is `:vert resize` or `:vert

[00:24:11] <ii14[m]> just ask your question, probably someone else will respond
[00:26:27] <ScentedFern> Well as soon as I add in some of the config lua, my LSP engine requires a restart before it'll process changes

[00:27:58] <ii14[m]> huh? what do you mean, like reloading your config?
[00:28:47] <ScentedFern> No like I open a file, make some edits, and normally returning to normal mode will have it lint.  But after adding in the config, I have to do LspRestart to actually see any changes
[00:29:09] <ScentedFern> Changes in the linting, that is
[00:29:15] <ii14[m]> I don't understand what do you mean by "adding in the config"
[00:29:55] <ScentedFern> Like putting it in the init
[00:30:06] <ii14[m]> what config?
[00:30:16] <ii14[m]> config for your linter?
[00:30:19] <ii14[m]> what linter is this?
[00:30:23] <ScentedFern> The nvim-cmp config
[00:30:47] <ScentedFern> Currently just using lspconfig and pyright
[00:31:14] <ii14[m]> okay, what is nvim-cmp config? is this a lua script, or did someone make a json configuration I didn't even know existed?
[00:32:12] <ScentedFern> Lua, like the code block here https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/wiki/Autocompletion
[00:32:23] <ScentedFern> Or the lua block here https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp/
[00:32:34] <ScentedFern> Under "recommended configuration" 
[00:33:25] <ii14[m]> okay, and how are you adding this lua block?
[00:33:31] <ii14[m]> is it just in your config?
[00:33:46] <ii14[m]> or are you somehow adding it dynamically
[00:33:53] <ScentedFern> No no it's just in my .vimrc 
[00:33:55] <ii14[m]> after you started nvim
[00:34:34] <ii14[m]> okay, and the issue is what, language server doesn't work unless you do :LspRestart?
[00:34:53] <ScentedFern> The language server doesn't update
[00:35:11] <sunjonSenghanBri> ... "the diagnostics don't update"
[00:35:22] <sunjonSenghanBri> which has nothing to do with cmp I suspect
[00:36:00] <ScentedFern> sunjonSenghanBri: yes thank you that's the phrase I'm struggling for haha
[00:36:25] <ScentedFern> I wouldn't be surprised if it had nothing to do with cmp; that's just what I did to isolate the problem
[00:36:31] <ii14[m]> yeah I know what you mean now, but I'm not sure what could it be
[00:36:44] <ScentedFern> Yeah sorry I utterly butchered that explanation

[00:59:55] <ScentedFern> Haha
[01:00:05] <ii14[m]> is nvim-cmp actually messing with diagnostics? it supposed to be just autocompletion

[08:33:21] <LordRishav> Oh, so max_item_count goes into each source name config!
[08:33:38] <LordRishav> I was adding it directly to cmp.sources
[08:36:50] <LordRishav> numToStr[m]: Still not working for some reason
[08:37:43] <numToStr[m]> LordRishav: It's working for me though
[08:39:23] <LordRishav> numToStr[m]: My cmp config https://0x0.st/-h4o.lua
[08:40:45] <LordRishav> Please have a look at it and see if there's anything wrong
[08:41:24] <numToStr[m]> LordRishav: It looks fine to me and simliar to mine.
[08:42:25] <LordRishav> Does not work for some reason still =(
[08:42:41] <numToStr[m]> Maybe have a look at mine https://github.com/numToStr/dotfiles/blob/nvim-cmp/neovim/.config/nvim/lua/numToStr/plugins/lsp/nvim-cmp.lua
[08:45:18] <LordRishav> For example, it still looks like this: https://i.imgur.com/Yohlrgy.png
[08:47:09] <LordRishav> And this in a java file: https://i.imgur.com/uqqRZNy.png
[08:47:31] <numToStr[m]> LordRishav: ohhh, you are talking about search `/` completion items. In your config you haven't added any limits to `/` completion, maybe that's why
[08:48:19] <LordRishav> Then it also happens to LSP completion items, like I showed in the second screenshot
[08:48:57] <numToStr[m]> LordRishav: This looks fine if you count the items for each sources. Like `Class` is probably coming from `lsp`

[16:12:25] <Xeroine> do you people think it would be a bad idea to run neovim from a docker container that is based on some really minimal linux image like alpine for example? I thought about doing this because I'm on opensuse leap which doesn't have the latest packages but alpine does and some plugins on neovim require you have to have kinda new packages
[16:12:55] <clason[m]> like https://github.com/nvim-lsp/try.nvim?
[16:13:30] <Xeroine> yeah lol
[16:13:41] <clason[m]> (you can also manually build from source and install locally, or use the app image. even if distro people will hate it ;))
[16:14:07] <Xeroine> I thought about doing that but isn't it really hard to compile with static linking?
[16:14:23] <clason[m]> no, not at all
[16:14:23] <clason[m]> it's easier
[16:14:32] <Xeroine> uh
[16:14:58] <Xeroine> how are you supposed to do it?
[16:14:58] <clason[m]> make sure you have the build prerequisite installed (https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Building-Neovim#opensuse)
[16:14:58] <Bowuigi[m]> Pass the "-static" flag to the C compiler and done
[16:15:09] <Xeroine> oh
[16:15:25] <Bowuigi[m]> Remember to compile it with musl
[16:15:31] <clason[m]> then it's as easy as cloning the repo and `make`
[16:15:31] <clason[m]> (then `sudo make install`, if you install to `/usr/local`)

[16:16:11] <clason[m]> To make this clear: I'm suggesting building and installing in the host system (openSUSE)
[16:16:26] <clason[m]> static is the default in the provided build scripts

[16:17:06] <clason[m]> ignore what the other person is saying; they're just confusing matters
[16:17:08] <clason[m]> * confusing matters ;)
[16:18:23] <Xeroine> but you'd still need to use "FROM somelinuxdistro" in Dockerfile afterwards then no? you couldn't run it just "FROM scratch"?
[16:19:39] <Bowuigi[m]> clason[m]: Oh I didn't knew that
[16:19:42] <Bowuigi[m]> clason[m]: True
[16:19:56] <Bowuigi[m]> Unintentionally but yeah
[16:20:29] <clason[m]> I know, just wanted to be sure ;)
[16:21:28] <clason[m]> If your heart is already set on creating a docker image (instead of just building 0.6.0 for Leap yourself, which I recommend), then I'd suggest looking at the `try.nvim` repo above and try to adapt it.
[16:21:38] <clason[m]> I don't use containers, so I can't help you with this.
[16:22:27] <Xeroine> oh
[16:22:33] <Xeroine> thanks clanson
[16:22:56] <Xeroine> clason*
[16:23:09] <clason[m]> (I also don't have any experience with "weird" Linux systems like Alpine...)
[16:23:17] <Xeroine> same
[16:23:33] <clason[m]> But I believe it works there: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Building-Neovim#alpine-linux
[16:23:50] <Xeroine> just saw it has a rly small image and rly new packages
[16:24:11] <Xeroine> yeah ty
[16:25:26] <clason[m]> But if you don't want to build from source, and are not married to the docker idea, you can also just download the appimage: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/v0.6.0
[16:25:39] <clason[m]> this is like a "neovim container"
[16:27:10] <Xeroine> yeah
[16:29:23] <clason[m]> (containers are used in try.nvim in order to have a "bigger" reproducible environment including language servers; if you just want the latest Neovim version, that is overkill)
