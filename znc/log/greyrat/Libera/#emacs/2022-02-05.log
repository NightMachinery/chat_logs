[09:35:04] <corwin> anyway, sure, of course you are welcome to ask a question.  usually just asking the question will get more responses than asking if it's okay to ask :)
[09:35:30] <yyng0> :)
[09:36:36] <yyng0> as I said, I'm installing use-pacakage. it says to declare some code somewhere, but I don't know where it is.
[09:36:57] <yyng0> the cod is here https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package#getting-started
[09:37:16] <yyng0> should I paste it to init.el ?
[09:37:46] <corwin> yup, it's talking about init.el
[09:38:18] <yyng0> great, thx

[19:30:32] <fnstudio> hi, i was looking at https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/dbus/index.html right now, as my emacs doesn't seem to be able to send notifications (via dunst)
[19:31:01] <fnstudio> in particular any call to notifications-notify results in this error: Error: (dbus-error "No connection to bus" :session)
[19:31:43] <fnstudio> i suspect that the problem is the lack of some dbus-related component in my system
[19:32:06] <fnstudio> (as opposed to a emacs-specific problem)
[19:32:28] <fnstudio> but i was wondering if anyone here were familiar with emacs+dbus and could give me some pointers
[19:33:17] <fnstudio> this seems to be suspicious already: the fact that `(dbus-list-activatable-names :session)' evaluates to nil

[21:36:26] <johnjaye> ggb: so like some kind of evil mode/paredit hybrid?
[21:36:42] <johnjaye> the idea was to have keys for cousins or nephew as well though
[21:36:51] <johnjaye> idk if asdf or sdfg would be that intuitive
[21:36:55] <johnjaye> i assume vim has nothing like this
[21:37:07] <ggb> vim uses g-hjkl for alternate movements.
[21:37:40] <johnjaye> ah
[21:37:41] <ggb> In typical usage, j is down one real, newline-delimited line. gj is down one visual line (if the line has wrapped).
[21:38:02] <corwin> asdf-uiop: w00t!
[21:38:18] <ggb> So, j and gj performing related, but different movements is a natural idiom.
[21:38:18] <johnjaye> interesting. so a more vimlike scheme would make say aj go left and down, bj go left down twice, cj 3 times etc
[21:39:05] <ggb> All movements can receive a count. 1j == j. 2j == down two lines. 2gj == down two visual lines.
[21:39:49] <ggb> Somewhat similar to C-u <number> prefix argument in emacs, but never (so far as I know) overloaded to alter the behavior of the action, only ever a count for repetition.
[21:40:12] <ggb> And yes, I'm thinking of evil, because I'm one of those dirty vim-preferrers.
[21:40:28] <ggb> (or, if we're in web-land, preferer).
[21:41:10] <johnjaye> hmm.

[21:41:32] <ggb> I'm honestly really liking this idea and thinking of rebinding my normal mode movement keys when paredit is active (evil integrates with per-mode keymaps).
[21:41:45] <johnjaye> i think that makes sense w.r.t. composability though
[21:42:00] <lisp123_> ggb: what do you mean
[21:42:10] <johnjaye> because to go to a nephew of the current node is combination of going over 1 then down 1
[21:42:21] <johnjaye> which is ultimately a combo of going up, right, down, down
[21:42:39] <lisp123_> You can also have a look at https://github.com/ashok-khanna/ParEvil
[21:42:41] <johnjaye> so would have to distinguish literaly going left right from cousin jumping
[21:43:00] <ggb> lisp123_: would you please specify your question a bit more? I've spewed a lot of text recently, so not sure what to clarify.

[21:51:52] <johnjaye> like standard vi nav mode not what i'm talking about
[21:51:59] <ggb> Nav mode is normal mode.
[21:52:18] <ggb> You start in normal mode. Some commands (such as a and i that you mentioned) take you into insert mode.
[21:52:28] <ggb> Escape (or C-[) take you out.
[21:52:52] <johnjaye> yeah but i don't think escape in emacs does that
[21:52:55] <ggb> I also bind jk to escape, as an easy home-row key combination that only shows up when discussing Edsger.
[21:52:59] <johnjaye> since it's used for meta character insert
[21:52:59] <ggb> In evil mode, it does.
[21:53:09] <johnjaye> that probably took some effort to engineer
[21:53:19] <ggb> evil overrides a whole bunch of standard emacs stuff.
[21:53:36] <johnjaye> that sounds like it could hurt you in the terminal
[21:53:46] <johnjaye> sometimes i recall having to use ESC when meta wouldnt' work
[21:53:52] <johnjaye> or use like F1 h instead of C-h
[21:54:07] <ggb> It keeps some. C-a and C-x increment and decrement the next number on the line (or under the cursor), by default in vim. Obviously a lot of emacs stuff lives behind C-x.
[21:54:12] <ggb> So some things are not overridden.

[21:55:37] <ggb> I typically use emacs with a graphical frame. When using it from the terminal, it's almost always for something quick where I don't hit any rough edges, such as writing a commit message when using git from command line.
[21:56:10] <ggb> Honestly, the C-x thing I mentioned above is the only thing I run into on a regular basis that is bothersome for me.

I had already tried a couple of formats from the documentation, but it doesn't seem to mention the authinfo format in the context of pass. https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/auth.html#Help-for-users-1 describes the correct format.

[22:02:14] <asdf-uiop> (https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/auth.html#index-auth_002dsources) and the 'password store' section are only about how the files containing the passwords are organised, not about their content.

[22:08:19] <ggb> In general, with such things, I prefer the version that is less constrained, as constraints can be added if necessary. If I have a function that *cannot* jump out of the sexp, then I would presume that it is more effort to hack that into a form that *can* jump out, than vice versa.

[22:46:34] <kensanata> Nope. Store it somewhere, or if it got printed, check out *Messages*
[22:46:54] <kensanata> (the buffer) -- usually long output is hidden but you can click on it to expand it, if I remember correctly.
[22:47:04] <irek> cuz: I believe that if you use (message "%s" (pp any-var)) you will have whole value in *Messages* buffer
