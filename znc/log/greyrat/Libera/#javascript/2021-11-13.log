[10:44:32] <sickdyd> is there a package that reorders emotion (or styled-components) CSS properties so that they're consistent across components?
[10:44:44] <sickdyd> even a bare alphabetical order would be nice
[10:44:56] <sickdyd> I try to have consistency, but it easily get messy
[10:45:31] <theskillwithin> hmm not sure,  awhile ago used to do something like that,  but alphabetical order doesn't make sense,  it ordered in a diff way

[10:47:47] <theskillwithin> mentally I think just write your css with like,  position at the top,  then box model stuffs like margin padding border,  then font and color
[10:48:33] <theskillwithin> so like position would be at the top,  then display, then margin,  then background color,  then font
[10:48:48] <theskillwithin>  then at the bottom media queries

[15:54:20] <pingpongball> stuck
[15:55:05] <silly> you can pass io into a function that's exported from those other files
[15:55:52] <silly> i have never tried to export from app.js and to import that in a file that's required in app.js
[15:56:01] <silly> seems kinda circular
[15:56:34] <stagas> silly: in vscode i see the object statically in js also using require or import when i hover it and it warns if i try to access properties that aren't there. but it's using typescript intellisense so maybe it needs to be enabled, but i think it comes out of the box like that
[15:56:36] <silly> now that i htink of it, it might work, but little do i actually know

[19:48:14] <lantech19446> it should say 10 because I told it to define a variable as zero, added 10 to it and then used it in a function that tells it to spit out the result of currentResult at that point on the page.

[20:32:36] <lantech19446> celphi: I figured it out I finally googled that error and the problem is I linked the script at the beginning of the html document so it ran before the function was defined
[20:32:39] <celphi> actually- nvm i tweaked program incorrectly. id is faster now - anyways moot point

[20:33:38] <celphi> so people put at end of body to defer the js
[20:33:41] <celphi> *some
[20:34:19] <lantech19446> according to the error it had to be after the function since the function was at the end of the document so must be the link
[20:34:41] <lantech19446> The “Uncaught TypeError: cannot set property ‘innerHTML’ of null” error is caused by trying to set an innerHTML value for an element whose value is equal to null. To solve this error, make sure your <script> tag comes after the element that you want to select in your script.
[20:34:59] <celphi> nah. if you use that JS i linked you'll be fine to put your script anywhere you want
[20:35:25] <celphi> moving it to after the element is hacking it imo
[20:35:49] <lantech19446> oh I know that because I didn't move my link and it worked, I'm sure once i'm more advanced in the course that point will be made but I really wanted to figure out why my teachers example worked and mine didn't

[20:36:45] <celphi> if your teacher is showing it after that makes me sad
[20:37:38] <lantech19446> I suspect it was just to make things simpler for us at the beginning of the course, the object was to show us how to define a variable it's literally the first thing I've ever coded in js
[20:38:32] <lantech19446> and they did show us that it should normally be in the head of the document that's why mine was there, I didn't realize that i had to move it back down for his example to work
[20:38:34] <celphi> for sure- but showing bad habits is bad idea. it's better for to say ignore this part for now
[20:38:58] <celphi> and have the listener
[20:39:33] <lantech19446> I could have also just done <script src='' defer and it would probably work too
[20:39:48] <celphi> yes but now your page will load slower
[20:39:55] <celphi> in both examples you're using
[20:40:21] <lantech19446> interesting
[20:40:52] <lantech19446> the only reason I know about defer and async is because it's what google says to do to eliminate blocking and speed up the page load
[20:40:53] <celphi> you can turn on the playstation go to bathroom and start game after you get back or you can goto bathroom turn on playstation and watch loading screen
[20:42:19] <lantech19446> I'm looking forward to the day when I actually know this stuff, I want to improve the accessibility of the web page my work uses
[20:44:07] <celphi> ;)
[20:44:23] <celphi> im assuming you mean performance and not accessibility?
[20:45:11] <lantech19446> no I mean accessibility like for people with disabilities to be able to use screen readers effectively and whatnot
[20:45:37] <lantech19446> most of the adjustments it needs according to lighthouse are going to require js
[20:45:59] <lantech19446> I have the performance on the desktop version up to 99-100 consistently mobile isn't so good
[20:46:37] <celphi> i see.

[20:47:34] <lantech19446> I've been studying web dev for about 3mos and in that time I've been working on our website using lighthouse so I've learned a considerable amount about optimization and I can read a lot of js I just don't know how to write it
[20:48:19] <earendel> o can we keep them? please
[20:48:27] <lantech19446> I consider accessibility to be our biggest downfall though I could care less about seo but we're a public library we're supposed to be accessible to every one and our website doesn't portray that in fact I think it shows that we don't care
