[11:44:07] <jotham> wehraboo
[11:44:17] <jotham> repeating it will make it clearer, right
[11:44:25] <jotham> A history or alternate history fan who is firmly entrenched in the belief that Nazi Germany's Wehrmacht was the best military in history, without a single flaw.
[11:49:29] <Renderwww> but it was the WWI army!
[14:15:07] *** Joins: random-jellyfish (~random-je@user/random-jellyfish)
[14:41:39] <random-jellyfish> this channel's topic should be changed to "tumbleweeds dancing in the wind"
[14:41:58] <jotham> random-jellyfish: you're very smart
[14:42:01] <Carbonflux> you can change it yourself using /topic 
[14:42:22] <jotham> random-jellyfish: serious question
[14:42:48] <jotham> random-jellyfish: why choose to be a toally mentally handicapped performance artist in front of a group of strangers
[14:42:58] <Carbonflux> Renderwww, i watched some episodes of that stuff on netflix, quite good visually, you were right.
[14:43:13] <random-jellyfish> changing the topic myself would be a much too vulgar display of power
[14:43:22] *** jotham changes topic to 'random-jellyfish is a faggot'
[14:43:35] <jotham> really insensitive title random-jellyfish 
[14:43:37] <random-jellyfish> we need to hold elections, have representatives, debate the main issues
[14:44:18] <jotham> random-jellyfish: are you vaxinated
[14:44:25] <random-jellyfish> I think it's the first time in my entire life when my nickname was in the topic of an IRC channel
[14:44:41] <random-jellyfish> I feel humbled and privileged by this honor

[14:45:19] <random-jellyfish> jotham got my 4th dose yesterday
[14:45:27] <jotham> english is hard work
[14:45:32] <jotham> 4 doses sounds wrong
[14:45:57] <random-jellyfish> the 3rd one was a bad trip, thought I'd try another one
[14:46:10] <jotham>  i don't belive you
[14:46:20] <jotham> but it's a moderaterly funny story
[14:46:32] <jotham> you probably mirthed up a few polish people
[14:47:33] <random-jellyfish> mixing and matching AstraZeneca, J&J, Pfizer and Moderna in 4 separate doses gave me truly spiritual experience
[14:47:43] <random-jellyfish> beats the hell out of acid
[14:48:09] <jotham> maybe if you hang around with americans
[14:51:36] <Carbonflux> hm, have you noticed you can no longer have children random-jellyfish?
[14:53:36] <random-jellyfish> Carbonflux haven't tried yet
[14:53:49] <random-jellyfish> last thing I'd want...kids
[15:00:04] <Carbonflux> ya i can see that
[15:00:38] <Carbonflux> i realized long ago it would be immoral for me to have kids.
