[04:27:54] <dre> damn, so my guestimate was right, tab-complete will actually replace that word rather than just appending to it; -- would I then, first, ${var2%%::} to remove everything after the last ::, and then do the ${var1#"$var2"}? so then it's the whole "something::else" rather than "hing::else"

[09:52:35] <Gamma> dhrv: there are tons of ways to do secret management, no best way imo
[09:52:44] <Gamma> Depends on your threat model
[10:01:26] <dhrv> Umm, I am not sure what threat means, I am having like an API Token, it doesn't have much of harm in case of like breach or something, I can remove it's access, but still it's better to be careful
[10:01:41] <dhrv> can you share some basic secret management?
[10:03:58] *** Joins: jmcantrell (~weechat@user/jmcantrell)
[10:04:01] <Gamma> If the secret is part of a public repository, then git-crypt is common
[10:04:43] <Gamma> If you have a password manager with a cli client, you could store the token in there and script around it
[10:05:16] <Gamma> Or you could just put it in a file which youw know you'll never share

[12:33:01] <greybot> bash builtins and keywords do not have separate man-pages, read bash's manual instead or use the help builtin. Rule of thumb: If ''type foo'' says foo is a builtin or keyword, run ''help foo'' or ''man bash'', otherwise try man and/or info.

[22:36:44] <earnestly> Well, at least this wouldn't work at all in posix (apparently) as it would exclude numbers like '1+2'
[22:37:05] <greycat> POSIX doesn't require bash's recursive arithmetic evaluation
[22:37:55] <alzgh> what is the backtick character called in bash manual?
[22:38:17] <greycat> `
[22:38:42] <greycat> but you won't find it by searching for that, because Chet loves "emacs quoting".
[22:38:56] <greycat> might be better to search for command substitution

[22:39:06] <greycat> or just ask your actual question
[22:39:38] <alzgh> I wanted to read up the part that tells me how backticks help me put the output of one command in a variable
[22:39:44] <earnestly> That's also latex quoting
[22:39:48] <alzgh> I'm reading this book and it is shit
[22:39:50] <greycat> Backticks are DEPRECATED.  Stop using them.
[22:40:02] <greycat> !`
[22:40:02] <greybot> The backquote (`) is used in the old-style command substitution, e.g. foo=`command`. The foo=$(command) syntax is recommended instead. Backslash handling inside $() is less surprising, and $() is easier to nest. See http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/082
[22:40:14] <earnestly> alzgh: Of course it's shit, everything that isn't wooledge (or bash-hackers.org) is shit

[22:40:24] <emanuele6> and m4 quoting
[22:40:31] <earnestly> alzgh: You can save yourself a *lot* of time by just excluding everything but those two places

[22:41:17] <greycat> `thing'
[22:41:30] <earnestly> Fortunately m4 lets you change the quoting characters
[22:41:37] <greycat> because on old commercial unix workstations, the default font have ` and ' as mirror images of each other

[22:42:55] <hwrd> I inherited some code that I guess used to work but now doesn't... if a function returns a value, is it possible for another function to call that function and assign a `$?` to  a variable?  This code is written this way, but the assignment is never reach, code exits.

[22:43:48] <greybot> hwrd: maybe this is the reason: "set -e" is an inheritance of the old bourne shell, and doesn't really work well with modern shell features. You'll really have less buggy scripts if you do the error handling manually instead of relying on the unreliable "set -e"; see http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/105

[22:44:14] <greycat> But yes, set -e is evil and you should stab it in the face.
