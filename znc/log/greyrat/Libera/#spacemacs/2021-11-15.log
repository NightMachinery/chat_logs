[07:05:26] <FromGitter> <manuel-arguelles> Hi, question about font size, is it possible to set a font size for a specific frame only? I'm doing a presentation of the code and the default size is too small, but I don't want to affect the other frames that I have with my notes, email and stuff (or would it be better to have two separate instances with different configuration?)
[08:25:07] <FromGitter> <manuel-arguelles> Ideally I'd like to increase the font of the buffer, but not everything else... like `SPC z x` but persistent across all buffers

[08:32:41] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> @manuel-arguelles I guess you could use `text-scale-mode` in the buffers you would like to have the text scaled (so in all buffers if you want to scale in all of them)
[08:37:06] <FromGitter> <manuel-arguelles> @dalanicolai yes, but I'd have to open all the buffers beforehand, I guess global font size would be
[08:38:47] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> What do you mean with 'global font size would be'? You can add a `hook` to activate text-scale-mode in buffers. You want it in all buffers?
[08:40:06] <FromGitter> <manuel-arguelles> hmmm oh, the hook idea sounds good, didn't think about it, let me check
[08:42:34] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> I am not sure which hook to use... maybe `buffer-list-update-hook`
[08:44:45] <FromGitter> <manuel-arguelles> let me try
[08:49:29] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> As `text-scale-mode-amount` is a local-variable, I think you should also set it with the hook
[08:50:19] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> So you could use ‚èé  ‚èé ```code paste, see link``` [https://gitter.im/syl20bnr/spacemacs?at=6191ee13d3ae402e47aac83e]
[08:52:00] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> However, this increases the size in ALL buffers (incl. helm/ivy etc.). So you could add a condition to only activate it in e.g. buffers derived from `prog-mode` or only buffers that are 'member' of a list of certain modes.
[08:54:08] <FromGitter> <manuel-arguelles> Thanks a lot!
[08:55:09] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Well... it is not an ideal solution... because now you can not really set the size manually in those buffers
[08:55:34] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> It would jump back when you switch buffers
[08:56:17] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> But I guess that would usually be no problem

[12:40:35] <FromGitter> <RoseWebb> I can do this in python, perhaps if there is a way to bind a python script by a short cut from spacemacs?
[12:49:23] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> I still don't know what you mean. How would you copy the actual file to the clipboard? I guess python is copying the file-path?

[12:53:05] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Well, I guess it is clear what you mean. So we just have to find out how python/your OS does this...
[12:53:31] <FromGitter> <sebastjan-hribar> Hi, I seem to have activated the file tree focus. Now, even opening a different folder in spacemacs the `spc f t`shows that file. How to deactivate this?
[12:55:55] <FromGitter> <RoseWebb> Sorry for the lack of clarity in my question @dalanicolai. I am just trying to explore what would be the easiest way to put a link to a file in my todo list. I am on windows 10. Ideally I want to ctrl-c a file then press a key shortcut to insert it to (spac)emcas.
[12:58:18] <FromGitter> <RoseWebb> if  there is no native way to dothat. then maybe I would be able to bind a python script to (spac)emcas shortcut so spacemacs will run the script, then insert the output to the cursor
[13:00:12] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Ah well, I am on GNU/linux. I can ctrl-c on a file, and then I can paste it into Spacemacs where it inserts the file-path.
[13:01:41] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> So this does not work similarly in Windows? (Of course then there only remains to just transform the filepath into a link)

[13:10:48] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Interestingly, I think there is no function to paste text as link (so that it creates a link/button). But it is easy enough to create a function for that (in org-files, just concat `file://` with the filepath)..

How to deactivate this? ‚èé  ‚èé I don't understand what you mean, with 'opening a folder' and 'showing that file'. Where do you open the folder, and where does it show the file?
[13:15:45] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> @sebastjan-hribar
[13:17:06] <FromGitter> <differentMonster> @dalanicolai i tested your theory and i figureout what wrong, spacemacs only detect docker file call dockerfile-mode, if i want to use just docker-mode, i will need to somehow self it myself in spacemacs and load it on the config. but after i change docker-mode to dockerfile-mode, it will load nicely. i am good with it cause i only want to it to regconize it so i can call out snippets easily on build :D
[13:20:26] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> @differentMonster Haha... it was not a thoery... it was what I tested and how it behaved here. So what you were doing (and did not work there) worked perfectly fine here...
[13:22:19] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> So I am not familiar with dockerfile-mode (nor docker-mode). But it sounds like maybe you just need to `require` docker-mode before you try to use it?
[14:06:26] <FromGitter> <RoseWebb> it seems that even if I link to a file, it does not open with C-c C-o

[16:22:30] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> @aleperalta82_twitter FYI I know that this works for `pyvenv` but I have never used `pyenv`
[16:24:06] <FromGitter> <aleperalta82_twitter> Thanks Daniel! Maybe I'm missing some config. I tried setting my pyenv manually, after loading the file, so maybe it's that.
[16:24:51] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Well, looking at the docs, it looks like it should work somehow for pyenv too... good luck
