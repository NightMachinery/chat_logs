[00:01:03] <pulse> i find open source evangelism somewhat funny but mostly sad
[00:01:16] <pulse> open source is great until it's forced on you as an idea to solve all problems of humanity
[00:01:20] <pulse> (it won't)
[00:01:34] <diophantoz> closed source is enclosure of the mind
[00:01:50] <derjanni> without open source we'd all be paying $1 per hour for the internet
[00:01:52] <diophantoz> eventually they charge you for using addition or subtraction
[00:01:57] <vdamewood> Naw, a skull is the enclosure of the mind.
[00:02:04] <derjanni> May I remind you of the internet days before Linux arrived.
[00:02:38] <oldlaptop> pulse: that is a vacuous criticism: no idea is going to "solve all the problems of humanity", and only strawmen claim otherwise.
[00:02:41] <SaulgoodmanBot> easy, it was only used in army and by universities
[00:02:57] <pulse> oldlaptop, there's some people who think you can get through anything with open source software
[00:03:06] <pulse> and they will even belittle you for using closed source without hesitation
[00:03:13] <pulse> those people don't have a clue how the world works
[00:03:30] <oldlaptop> Wow, I've never seen a goalpost move that fast.
[00:03:34] <derjanni> Back in 95-98 we basically only had expensive Unix servers, Netscape servers and Microsoft IIS. The internet was a nightmare.

[00:04:58] <jeaye> pulse: But we do hire 3d artists and have them use Blender.

[00:25:27] <pyzozord> as far as I know it's nothing special just a assembly instruction that can operate on a larger range of memory fast

[00:27:02] <vdamewood> pyzozord: It require special registers, and It doesn't work in memory, but you can copy contiguous values from memory as a whole.

[00:27:59] <vdamewood> You can then move on to elements4-7, and so on.
[00:28:46] <mrig> so for specific tasks it really is an advantageous tool from the sounds of it, if used properly.
[00:29:14] <vdamewood> It's especially useful in multimedia applications, like applying audio effects, graphical filters, and such.
[00:29:23] <pyzozord> yeah as far as I understand it, simd is 50% of the modern cpu speed
[00:29:41] <pyzozord> another 49% is cpu cache and pipelining
[00:29:45] <vdamewood> After all, if you want to saturate an image, that's just adding a value to each pixel.

[01:31:39] <vdamewood> Actually, wait, nevermind that.

[01:33:32] <zzz> there are only 10000 possible inputs, arent there?
[01:33:52] <vdamewood> So after the third instruction you will have X + y + 1 in @3
[01:34:01] <pyzozord> I don't think counting xs and ys will work, because you don't sum x+y. you sum N[x] + N[y]

[01:54:55] <pyzozord> hmm I'm not sure
[01:55:19] <pyzozord> because value of x does not directly corelate with program rsult, because x is a pointer, not a literal value
[01:55:30] <vdamewood> No. It's a literal value.
[01:55:58] <pyzozord> in the program givem [1,X,Y] x and y are pointers
[01:56:10] <vdamewood> a value put into the program is only ever a pointer in its own instruction.
[01:56:41] <vdamewood> So, for example, in the second instruction is says 1, 1, 2, 3, here X and Y are being used for their actual values.
[01:57:03] <pyzozord> ah yeah
[01:57:12] <vdamewood> So, if X were 3, and y were 12, then 1, 1, 2, 3 would result in 3 + 12 = 15 being stored in @3
[01:57:55] <vdamewood> And the result fo the first instruction is stored in @3, while the result of the second instruction overwrites that value before it's ever used.
[01:58:04] <pyzozord> 1, 1, 2, 3 will always result in 1, 1, 2, 5
[01:58:22] <pyzozord> oops i mean 1,1,2,3

[01:58:56] <pyzozord> uh, sorry, it's 0:28am here, can't think clearly anymore
[01:58:59] <vdamewood> The result of 1, 1, 2, 3 depends on the values in @1 and @2.

[05:24:04] <aituxx> I have a empty repository as of now for the program I'm building, but will very slowly start adding to it as I learn.
[05:24:39] <Izem> ^-^hi: "Since both clang (our C frontend) and Terra target the LLVM intermediate representation, there is no additional overhead in calling a C function."
[05:25:31] <Izem> plus static types :)
[05:26:14] <^-^hi> I think also LuaJIT compiles to machine code (since it is what I guess JIT is) and the FFI comes with no overhead.
[05:27:08] <Izem> I can't see the JIT  being the FFI interface

[07:05:14] * oldlaptop really does wish sometimes that C-family compilers could impose most of python's indentation rules
[07:05:35] <InPhase> oldlaptop: You could implement an indent-based C.
[07:06:15] <oldlaptop> I generally dislike python, but I do appreciate that it manages to enforce the correct usage of tabs - even in the face of a general culture in its community that would probably just as soon ban them entirely
[07:06:23] <deniska> oldlaptop: clang has -Wmisleading-indentation
[07:06:28] <InPhase> oldlaptop: All the C programmers would hate you for it being indented, and all the non-C users would hate you for it being C, but you could implement it.  :)
[07:06:56] <oldlaptop> deniska: I'm thinking specifically of the sort of mixed tab/space monstrosity flaknet99 is describing
[07:07:23] <InPhase> oldlaptop: Python enforces spaces, not tabs.  There's a whole language-standard style guide about that.
[07:07:35] <deniska> oldlaptop: ah, py2 and py3 treat mixing tabs and spaces differently
[07:08:02] <deniska> py2 treats tab as the amount of whitespace to the next column divisable by 8
[07:08:14] <InPhase> Tabs in Python should just be an error.
[07:08:16] <oldlaptop> I'm given to understand Python 2 is different, but Python 3 requires, if tabs are used, that they be used semantically, to denote levels of indentation
[07:08:29] <InPhase> Even permitting tabs was the one indentation mistake Python made.
[07:08:54] <deniska> py3 doesn't care if you mix tabs and spaces as far as you're doing it consistently in an identation level
[07:09:01] <pulse> i find it both hilarious and sad at the same time that we still have Python 2
[07:09:25] <deniska> so the first level can be two spaces, the second level can be two spaces and a tab, and you can throw in another 6 spaces for the third level :)
[07:10:01] <pulse> i dislike python principally because it's sluggish
[07:10:07] <pulse> they should V8 it
[07:10:51] <oldlaptop> InPhase: I would refuse point-blank to use that language.
[07:11:32] <InPhase> oldlaptop: Well I don't want to ever have to edit tabbed code anyway.  :)
[07:12:50] <deniska> pulse: v8'd python is called pypy
[07:12:56] <InPhase> oldlaptop: I've had to make tabs visible in my editor just to cope with the tab code that's out there.  This feels silly.
[07:13:29] <pulse> deniska, is it actually V8 tier or just slightly faster than normal Python
[07:13:53] <oldlaptop> pulse: Easily twice as fast for some things, as I recall.
[07:14:15] <pulse> InPhase, i change my coworker's space code into tabs and send them back to them
[07:14:39] <pulse> oldlaptop, that's decent but i have few points of reference to know if that's actually comparable to V8
[07:14:41] <InPhase> pulse: Fortunately it's easier to change tabs to spaces than to change spaces to tabs.
[07:15:00] <InPhase> pulse: A document-wide replace does it in a second.
[07:15:19] *** Joins: dstein64- (~dstein64@dannyadam.com)
[07:15:29] <InPhase> pulse: you can't always get away with it in reverse, because spaces serve other useful purposes in code, and tabs don't.
[07:15:41] <pulse> the problem is i make tab only code, then that gets passed around, copied, mauled, etc. and when it comes back to me it's now full of half space/half tabs, spaces, and my original tabs
[07:15:52] <pulse> and then i can't stand it and change it all to tabs, send it over, and repeat
[07:16:01] <pulse> it's kind of like a dance
[07:16:10] <pulse> InPhase, yes sometimes it's hard
[07:16:15] <oldlaptop> pulse: Python's rules do an excellent job of preventing that; the interpreter simply won't accept code subjected to that kind of mangling
[07:16:17] <InPhase> pulse: That's what's wrong with tabs.  :)  They don't work with good editor settings.
[07:16:45] <pulse> oldlaptop, yeah i guess that's one positive about Python
[07:16:52] <arahael> That wasn't always the case.

[07:16:56] *** dstein64- is now known as dstein64
[07:17:09] <arahael> Back in python 2.x, you could freely mix tabs and spaces, with disasterious results.
[07:17:22] <InPhase> pulse: What is the merit to doing your code in tab form anyway?  All modern editors can indent tab presses as spaces just fine.
[07:17:38] <InPhase> pulse: You don't save key presses.
[07:17:50] <arahael> pulse: Also, PEP-8 encourages spaces.
[07:17:52] <oldlaptop> InPhase: The same as the merit of any other form of semantic markup. Indentation is distinguished from alignment.
[07:17:54] <pulse> InPhase, smaller filesize, clearer intent and the fact that i've been doing it since i started programming :p
[07:18:22] <InPhase> pulse: In 5 minutes you could whip up a script to fix all your old code.  :)
[07:18:36] <pulse> also tabs allow you to configure your indentation size per user
[07:18:45] <pulse> so if you prefer the look of 2-wide code, you can do that
[07:18:47] <pulse> and i can still have 4-wide
[07:18:50] <pulse> with spaces you can't do that
[07:19:34] <oldlaptop> The most useful consequence is that individual viewers can scale indentation width to their preferences. (This does not work on bogusly-indented code, obviously. You need to rigorously use tabs such that the semantic meaning of one tab as one level of indentation is preserved.)
[07:20:12] <InPhase> oldlaptop: But open up a file, and you never know if that was actually done unless you make tabs visible.

[07:20:56] <pulse> oh, one more great reason lol
[07:21:09] <pulse> if you have spaces in most editors you need to press left arrow 4 times to go left one indent
[07:21:14] <oldlaptop> Python more or less enforces this, and enforcement in static-checking scripts isn't all that difficult in *most* other languages. In practice, enforcing a rule that \t may never occur except immediately after \n or \t prohibits most of the common blithe mangling.
[07:21:15] <pulse> with tabs it's always one keystroke
[07:21:34] <pulse> and if your editor is doing seamless space tabs, why bother with spaces anyway
[07:21:47] <pulse> it's one of those things i don't want to ever change about myself, i'm a tab4lifer lol
[07:22:09] <pulse> i mean if i'm working on your codebase and it has spaces, i'll use spaces of course
[07:22:12] <pulse> i'm not a sith lord
[07:22:19] <pulse> but all my code uses tabs
[07:22:28] <pulse> (my projects code)
[07:22:56] <oldlaptop> Even for code that's doing the "one level is four spaces, two levels is one \t", it'll usually also have "one level is four spaces, two levels is one \t, and three levels is '    \t    ', which will be caught by even that extremely lazy filter.

[07:31:24] <InPhase> Really if we had git and editors working together in concert, code would just reformat on the fly to each person's preferences but without causing any diffing issues.
[07:32:06] <InPhase> All commits would auto-format to the codebase standard, all edited files would open by the locally configured display settings.
[07:33:02] <InPhase> We have this technology, it's just not really being used.
[07:33:05] <oldlaptop> The "codebase standard" in that case surely ought to be semantic tabs, for efficiency on the checkout side if nothing else.

[07:38:17] <InPhase> pulse: Or diff it?  diff to console expands tabs to 8.
[07:38:19] <pulse> no i don't use tools from the 70s
[07:39:08] <pulse> i avoid the terminal in general, i know horrible
[07:39:18] <InPhase> Weird, actually.

[07:39:37] <pulse> not to mention colorful, and adjustable
[07:39:42] <InPhase> But I guess you would have to, to deal with the tabs.

[07:39:46] <pulse> ha
[07:40:07] <pulse> in fact these days i only use the terminal for git
[07:40:27] <arahael> I find gitk and git gui are very complimentary to the command line.
[07:40:29] <oldlaptop> I generally want eight columns per indentation level anyway, when that fits, though I'll take six as well. I don't much like indentations smaller than that, it starts to get hard to follow.
[07:40:31] <pulse> because git interfaces are somehow still worse than 15 year old Subversion
[07:40:42] <pulse> arahael, complementary yes
[07:40:49] <arahael> That. :)

[07:46:20] <InPhase> Even simple questions like, "What has changed recently?" can be really hard to address with gitk as soon as there is some merging.

[08:12:10] <InPhase> The important debugging question isn't what day did Bob type some code in, it's what changed last night in the codebase that broke my stuff.  :)

[10:21:57] <Intelo> well in javascript, you can make your own custom rules with eslint
[10:22:10] <Intelo> must be similar with other languages as wel
[10:22:14] <Intelo> if not we have 2 options:
[10:22:20] <Intelo> ast and regex
[10:22:36] <password> but can you regex just vars?
[10:22:50] <Intelo> scan code with ast , if not ast, then regex. but first check readymade linter customizations
[10:22:58] <Intelo> password vars have patterns
[10:23:12] <Intelo> regex is last option.
[10:23:20] <Intelo> I won't recommend it as first option
[10:23:34] <password> i won't recoomend it either way XD
[10:23:46] <Intelo> 1: linter premade rule 2: linter custom rule  3: ast  4: regex

[10:36:21] <PlanckWalk> Recursion + memoization = dynamic programming, basically.

[10:36:54] <pyzozord> there is also another form, bottm-up 
[10:37:08] <xeno> PlanckWalk: well, memoization doesn't make much sense without recursion
[10:37:19] <PlanckWalk> I've used it to build 3D tables in some combinatorial math problem.  Also some cases where dimensionality isn't really applicable.

[10:38:22] <PlanckWalk> If you are building tables of some fixed dimension than by the time you're working with 4+ then your runtime is giong to crap.

Wikipedia page views show markedly declined interest relative to Intellij, Netbeans, and with Android Studio not being based on it, either, I wonder which to look at most closely.

[12:25:04] <pyzozord> I am between the vim and ed real programmer levels
[12:26:00] <dTal> I massively prefer IDEs but I've yet to find a good one
[12:26:07] <mrig> letsdothis: eclipse as the go to free IDE has really been superseded by visual studio code, and it mostly focuses on javascript, intelij is proprietary and charge rent for the use of their code.
[12:26:27] <mrig> UNIX is a superb IDE works really well with a GUI such as vim.
[12:26:39] <pyzozord> I know people hate eclipse, but I kind of liked it when I used it
[12:26:47] <pyzozord> I liked intelij too when I used it
[12:26:47] <dTal> I don't understand who *wouldn't* prefer a tool that has had dedicated human factors development towards making the task at hand easier
[12:26:51] <iridium__> mrig: i concur. my IDE is Unix too. that's what i should have said.
[12:27:04] <mrig> visual studio code feel a little to toy like somehow.
[12:27:09] <dTal> Unix is a DE but it ain't I
[12:27:17] <pyzozord> but the OG IDE for me is PhpStorm :D
[12:27:31] <mrig> all the sharp edges smoothed off, and padded walls :D
[12:27:34] <pyzozord> oh no sorry! that's intelij, I meant something else

[12:28:39] <mrig> vim with the knowledge of the shell that is hosting it is awesome.
[12:29:07] <mrig> Though that said, I'm quite impressed by visual studio in windows.
[12:29:12] <pyzozord> PHPEdit! That is the real og editor for me
[12:29:19] <mrig> been a bit of a shocker that one.
[12:29:32] <dTal> iridium__: you're moving the goal posts, now it's vim that's the IDE
[12:29:37] <letsdothis> iridium__: It's about convenience, and arguably efficiency, but not effectiveness. Way back, I wrote microcode as strings of bitmasks, but can't say I miss it...
[12:29:50] <dTal> no matter what I say you're going to say there's a vim plugin for that
[12:29:53] <pyzozord> no wrong! Not PHPEdit. PhpEd.
[12:30:05] <dTal> that's not the same as unix being an ide
[12:30:09] <pyzozord> PHPEd from NuSphere. I was there. Ten years ago.
[12:30:55] <dTal> Anyway, I'm pretty sure there's a lot of useful stuff that vim-the-ide can't do
[12:30:56] <mrig> The longer that I've used vim, the fewer plugins I use, as most of it can be done by the interface's native tool set.

[14:48:54] <audiobirb> ok...
[14:49:01] * mrig ponders the notion that is 'sining jumbos' :D
[14:49:02] <pyzozord> I think your git reads your private id_rsa
[14:49:14] <pyzozord> you upload the public key online to github
[14:49:18] <audiobirb> let's say i have two keys, one for my local machine and one for the production server. how does github/bitbucket know to accept keys from both?
[14:49:23] <pyzozord> but you need to sign your commits with your private key
[14:49:28] <audiobirb> pyzozord, HOW
[14:49:32] <audiobirb> is what im asking
[14:49:39] <audiobirb> "sign commits with private key"
[14:50:11] <mrig> I would think that ssh is the only agent that can read that, and that it uses it to dencrypt.
[14:50:17] <pyzozord> I don't really know. Essentially it uses your private key + the changes and hashes all that into a check sum
[14:50:30] <mrig> it would sign with the public key, that is why it is public :)
[14:51:13] <pyzozord> mrig: you might be right, it might be that ssh-agent is the only one who reads ~/.ssh, maybe git client always uses ssh-agent

[16:31:25] <mrig> It's fascinating.
[16:31:28] <[itchyjunk]> but when the ideas of number theory get generalized in algebra, it's kinda cool
[16:31:29] <pyzozord> it seems to be have a lot of depth
[16:31:40] <[itchyjunk]> there are things that behave like numbers but aren't numbers
[16:31:56] <[itchyjunk]> pyzozord, for some of these, you just want to stick to formal definition
[16:31:59] <[itchyjunk]> and it's much simpler
[16:32:12] <[itchyjunk]> instead of pseudo metaphysical nonesense

[16:33:05] <mrig> [itchyjunk]: citing pesudo metaphysical nonsense give the scope of modern knowledge, is to show ones own ignorance.

[16:52:09] <pyzozord> that is what actually happend anyway
[16:52:16] <mrig> Lyn: if you are the only one using the repo then it is fine to do a git push force.
[16:52:50] <mrig> which would overwrite the other repo with your local one.
[16:53:00] <pyzozord> I git push force constantly, because I always amend my commits
[16:53:07] <Lyn> yeah, it is fine, but I still have no idea how to grab a bunch of commits and place them neatly onto another project
[16:53:13] <pyzozord> (but that's only on feature branches, never develop or master)
[16:53:38] <mrig> Lyn: you can use cherry pick but only if the commits are neatly independent and well organised.

[17:56:02] <jaitoon> wedr: uhh I'm not sure but it probably depends, is it someone internal?
[17:56:42] <[itchyjunk]> can't you just sanitize the inputs so you take it to lower case?
[17:56:48] <jaitoon> [itchyjunk]: oh I'll ask in #haskell then. I was actually gonna try starting in scheme but it seems haskell has more modern resources anyways
[17:56:54] <[itchyjunk]> if your code is case sensitive, sounds like you should sanitize your data
[17:57:10] <[itchyjunk]> jaitoon, they hard recommended some nice generic FP book
[17:57:17] <wedr> [itchyjunk], it comes directly from HttpServletRequest.getServerName()

[18:00:46] <GeDaMo> Why wouldn't it return capital letters?
[18:01:13] <wedr> It's not part of the RFC standard to do so, isn't it? Like, isn't the server name always case-insensitive?
[18:01:31] <GeDaMo> Case insensitive doesn't mean always lowercase
[18:01:45] <GeDaMo> Why are the capital letters a problem?
[18:01:52] <[itchyjunk]> right case sensitive means 'Server' and 'server' are different
