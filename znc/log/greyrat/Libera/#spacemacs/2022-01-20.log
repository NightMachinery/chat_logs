[10:02:40] <FromGitter> <magthe:tchncs.de> Is there a specific reason for why you bring in `org-roam` this way, instead of using the layer's support for it? ‚èé  ‚èé `````` [https://gitter.im/syl20bnr/spacemacs?at=61e90208742c3d4b21a7d906]
[10:10:18] <FromGitter> <magthe:tchncs.de> @lebensterben: OK, so it's more powerful because it's independent of the program, i.e. it can be used from/by other programs than Emacs. ‚èé  ‚èé When using it with Emacs, does it also allow calling elisp expressions during expansion?

[13:08:06] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> no.
[13:08:20] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> it calls nothing.
[13:09:15] <FromGitter> <magthe:tchncs.de> Ah, so then, in the context of Emacs, I'd say it's less powerful than e.g. yasnippets.
[13:43:49] <FromGitter> <bernalex:matrix.org> Hey. Any suggestions how to easily compile a latex file from any non-master-tex file? I was kinda hoping I could just put '% TeX-master: "../main' in my chapter would be sufficient, but it just ignores this and tries compiling the file I'm in rather than the master.
[14:18:14] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Spacemacs has a shortcut for that also `SPC T m`
[14:18:30] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> FYI
[14:33:06] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Can you check `M-x org-version`?

[17:56:46] <FromGitter> <fran-penedo> Hello everyone! I just bumped into a similar bug to https://github.com/deb0ch/emacs-winum/issues/5. When scope is set to frame-local, I can open emacs just fine and create new frames, but when I open it in server mode (for example `emacsclient -s foobar -c -a ""`) it momentarily opens a window in scratch buffer and then crashes. Anyone knows how I could debug and fix this?

[18:34:15] <Codaraxis__> I have an issue wherein (I think) hooks aren't reliably executing. However, it manifests as a heisenbug in that, if I run a hook-triggering action with the debugger on, the hooks fire correctly.
[18:34:30] <Codaraxis__> Is this a known bug with a known fix?
