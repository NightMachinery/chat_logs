[00:08:05] <lagash> waleee: no, it and auto-mode-rules.lisp are only overrided when I do something explicit, like save a new bookmark, add a new auto-mode rule, etc
[00:08:51] <lagash> waleee: also you don't happen to be using Emacs' git-link are you? :)
[00:09:33] <waleee> hadn't heard of it until now
[00:09:56] <lagash> ah, well, it's great for grabbing links to code when collaborating :)
[00:14:19] <rotateq> pjb: of course
[00:17:45] <waleee> jmercouris: is there any reason to not use :if-exists :append for the bookmarks file?
[00:22:00] * waleee goes ahead with an empirical study
[00:24:40] <waleee> still the overwriting of the symlink

[15:11:31] <rotateq> may be one of my dumb questions, but how much effort would it be porting nyxt also to have it with McCLIM some day?
[15:11:48] <rotateq> as it's such a great project :)
[15:36:27] <aartaka> rotateq: It wouldn't be much effort to port Nyxt to McCLIM if only McCLIM had a rendering engine comparable to WebKit/Blink/Gecko/Servo. This is unfortunately not the case, afaik.
[15:38:13] <aartaka> rotateq: I mean, I would be cool to resurrect Closure (a CL-based rendering engine), but we're no Apple to support a full-featured rendering engine development :)

[16:20:32] <rotateq> ah right the wibbly-wobbly web stuff
[16:41:28] <edgarvincent[m]> aartaka: master seems to build fine now - and the libsoup error seems to have disappeared!
[16:58:27] <edgarvincent[m]> The beastify extension loads, and the buttons appear on the right side. However, nothing happens in the browser when I click them and the following error is displayed in the console: Gdk-WARNING **: 14:27:55.104: Event with type 8 not holding a GdkDevice. It is most likely synthesized outside Gdk/GTK+
[17:13:38] <aartaka> edgarvincent[m]: Ah, that's expectable. I've not sorted out the logistics of putting the WebExtensions library in the right place for the whole thing to work. Working on it now. Hopefully, simple extensions will be runnable with minimum configuration by Christmas :)
[17:14:20] <aartaka> But I'm glad to hear it builds fine of Arch!
[17:14:32] <aartaka> Because it's broken on Guix now xD
[17:15:03] <edgarvincent[m]> I still don't understand the commit you pushed which solved the issue -- I have to study it carefully :)
[17:15:41] <edgarvincent[m]> aartaka: Thanks again for your amazing work.
[17:15:55] <edgarvincent[m]> This is going to be a huge step forward for Nyxt.
[17:16:33] <aartaka> edgarvincent[m]: Yeah, and a huge responsibility for me :D
[17:17:05] <edgarvincent[m]> I'm not aware of any small libre browsers which support webextensions.
[17:17:14] <edgarvincent[m]> aartaka: Indeed...
[17:17:27] <edgarvincent[m]> Are you enjoying the fact that you're working on it?
[17:17:27] <aartaka> edgarvincent[m]: But what's the commit you're referring to?
[17:17:44] <aartaka> The `cffi-toolkit:*cc*` one?
[17:18:36] <edgarvincent[m]> aartaka: The last four ones actually.
[17:18:40] <aartaka> I do, even though it's mostly C programming. But I find it cognitively hard to return to it after long breaks, as it requires quite a twisted thinking :)
[17:19:37] <aartaka> Ah, it's basically sloppily imitating Makefile with ASDF and what it leads to (:
[17:20:52] <edgarvincent[m]> I see, ok ^^
[17:21:09] <edgarvincent[m]> The WebExtensions support looks like a *huge* job.
[17:21:31] <edgarvincent[m]> I'am amazed by the progress you made.
[17:21:37] <edgarvincent[m]> I'm*
[17:31:24] <aartaka> Thanks edgarvincent[m], that's comforting to hear :)
