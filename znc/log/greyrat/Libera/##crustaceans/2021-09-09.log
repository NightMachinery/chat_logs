[00:00:35] <prussian> not with that attitude it wont :(
[00:02:04] <manicennui> Oh fuck.
[00:02:20] <manicennui> Meeting is being led by this PM who has no understand of anything we work on, but always oversells everything.
[00:06:14] <prussian> rip.
[00:06:23] <manicennui> A coworker just admitted to liking the Aeon Flux movie on Slack.
[00:06:27] <manicennui> Should I report him to HR?
[00:06:27] <prussian> i have a mentoring meeting and I don't have anything prepared.
[00:06:32] <prussian> yes
[00:06:37] <prussian> the live action one right?
[00:06:38] <prussian> lol
[00:06:40] <manicennui> Yes.
[00:06:42] <skyl4rk> aeon flux is bad?
[00:06:50] <manicennui> The live action movie? Yes.
[00:06:50] <skyl4rk> don't remember much of it
[00:06:53] <prussian> man when was that movie? I don't even remember
[00:07:02] <Geekingfrog> what does your mentee wants out of that prussian ?
[00:07:09] <skyl4rk> think I saw the live action one ...something about an airship?
[00:08:03] <prussian> Geekingfrog: ugh. things I hate (GwT)
[00:08:08] <prussian> GWT
[00:08:27] <Geekingfrog> as in, google web toolkit ?
[00:09:03] <prussian> yes
[00:09:04] <prussian> lol
[00:09:13] <prussian> the future is now.

[00:09:17] <Brekkjern> Why would you make such a thing?
[00:09:26] <Geekingfrog> so, your mentee wants to get better at the tech and is looking for your guidance on that?
[00:09:30] <prussian> uh.... because the web was hell back then?
[00:09:31] <prussian> idk
[00:09:42] <prussian> I was a wee wittle highschool child when it was big.
[00:09:56] <prussian> Geekingfrog: so it seems
[00:10:04] <Geekingfrog> it's been a while I didn't heard the name tbh
[00:10:13] <prussian> well, not necessarily all GWT, but he mentioned that specifically
[00:10:34] <Geekingfrog> uhm ok. I had something somewhat similar at my current workplace, and always found it a bit tricky
[00:11:19] <manicennui> This thing is less powerful than what we already have, but it uses Kafka!
[00:12:37] <gwozniak> Thn Aeon Flux movie with Charlize Theron was about 2006
[00:13:46] <prussian> i feel old new
[00:13:47] <prussian> now
[00:13:52] <prussian> manicennui: sounds nextgen
[00:13:59] <prussian> or is kafka old now?
[00:14:20] <manicennui> Probably.
[00:14:25] <manicennui> Too stable.
[00:14:36] <gwozniak> Need to shake things up
[00:14:57] <prussian> I'm sure there is an AWS service for that(tm) as well
[00:15:29] <manicennui> Kinesis
[00:15:35] <mouseghost> tbh 5d chess isnt that hard
[00:15:50] <prussian> well, trump was playing it, no?
[00:15:54] <prussian> manicennui: ya that.
[00:23:04] <ngoldbaum> so previous tenant had a wsj subscription they didn’t cancel
[00:23:15] <ngoldbaum> guess i just get to recycle the wsj forever now
[00:23:26] <ngoldbaum> there’s no way to cancel if you’re not the account owner
[00:26:38] <mouseghost> lmao
[00:26:45] <mouseghost> ngoldbaum, free paper
[00:27:25] <manicennui> Previous tenant?
[00:27:41] <manicennui> Office or apartment?
[00:27:46] <ngoldbaum> house
[00:27:52] <manicennui> Ah.
[00:27:56] <manicennui> WSJ isn't cheap.
[00:28:00] <manicennui> Surprised they wouldn't take care of that.

[01:08:30] <buttsbot> Twitter - stewartbrand - This could be revolutionary for filmmakers and their audiences—NFT-based distribution.  The pioneers are the makers of the...
[01:08:48] <manicennui> I don't understand why crypto needs to be involved in this.
[01:08:57] <manicennui> A kickstarter/indiegogo would be funded instantly for this.
[01:11:52] <manicennui> Actually, they are asking for over $3 million worth of ETH.
[01:12:08] <manicennui> But they are nowhere close to hitting that goal.
[01:19:52] <mouseghost> meh my semi artistic background picture made on an analog camera on facebook got 6 reactions... others get tens of them for profile pictures x_x
[01:20:14] <gwozniak> manicennui: just a quick look at that and it sounds incredibly dum
[01:20:24] <gwozniak> *dumb
[01:20:49] <gwozniak> Exactly how does this change anything with film distribution...?
[01:20:58] <manicennui> IT CHANGES EVERYTHING
[01:21:03] <gwozniak> Oh, right
[01:21:12] <gwozniak> Because crapto is involve
[01:21:13] <manicennui> I have no idea.
[01:21:17] <riv> hate this shit
[01:21:28] <manicennui> It just seems like a different currency for crowdfunding.
[01:21:43] <manicennui> With rewards that are even dumber.
[01:21:52] <gwozniak> So instead of sending money, send fake money
[01:21:59] <manicennui> I do want to see that documentary though.
[01:22:08] <manicennui> So if you could give them all your ETH I'd appreciate it.
[01:22:24] <manicennui> Thing is, if they took USD, I'd contribute.
[01:23:21] <manicennui> Oh boy. My employer who has over $1 billion in revenue is going to give $5k to some charities.
[01:23:36] <gwozniak> Breaking the bank there, I see
[01:25:00] <manicennui> Someone asked whether we are looking into some kind of crypto offering. Nope.
[01:25:21] <manicennui> We enjoy making money instead.

[01:48:08] <ngoldbaum> that’s a no
[01:48:54] <gwozniak> yikes
[01:49:51] <ngoldbaum> i don’t even want to be in my professional network
[01:51:42] <riv> so this was uniroinc "isn't bitcoin the  future?"
[01:53:52] <gwozniak> Yes, I think so
[01:55:18] <dimadima> ngoldbaum: i understand your nick is your first initial-last name but
[01:55:33] <dimadima> how did this person correctly identify you on linked in
[01:55:48] <dimadima> what's his objective i wonder
[01:57:08] <riv> oof
[01:57:10] <ngoldbaum> goldbaum is reasonably rare and i said i had an astronomy phd, i’m probably the only goldbaum with an astronomy phd
[01:57:22] <riv> he seems really naive and keen on bitcoin
[01:57:59] * dimadima now has enough info to identify ngoldbaum
[01:57:59] <Brekkjern> ngoldbaum: So would you say there is a universe where you accept their request?
[01:58:02] <dimadima> mwahahaha
[01:58:25] <dimadima> i don't know... i'd wager there are at least 12 goldbaums with astronomy phds
[01:58:48] <dimadima> and at least 1 or 2 astrology
[01:59:03] <ngoldbaum> i think you’re substantially overestimating the number of astronomy PhDs globally
[01:59:18] <ngoldbaum> and i mean who in this conversation are you going to trust on fermi problems :p
[01:59:25] <riv> hehe
[02:00:13] <dimadima> is astronomy in the physics department
[02:00:20] <dimadima> like, could we widen this to physics
[02:01:21] <ngoldbaum> sometimes it is
[02:01:29] <ngoldbaum> but then you’re getting a physics phs
[02:01:32] <ngoldbaum> err phd
[02:01:42] <dimadima> yeah google seems to indicate that you are, obviously, correct
[02:02:14] <ngoldbaum> sometimes it’s a “physics & astronomy” department but then usually you’re getting a physics degree and have to take jackson e&m blech
[02:02:28] <dimadima> weird there aren't more goldbaums doing astronomy. billions of humans and only 1 goldbaum astronomy PHD that sucks
[02:02:44] <ngoldbaum> dimadima: it’s the nazis fault :/
[02:02:56] <dimadima> smh
[02:02:57] <ngoldbaum> (sorry to be a downer)
[02:03:18] <dimadima> happy rosh hashana
[02:03:26] <gwozniak> At my alma mater, it was the Physics & Astronomy department
[02:03:34] <ngoldbaum> my grandparents fled to the glorious workers paradise of the soviet union when the germans invaded poland
[02:03:45] <dimadima> interesting time to flee!
[02:03:48] <ngoldbaum> and was promptly shipped to a work camp in tajikstan
[02:03:50] <dimadima> never heard of that move tbh
[02:03:54] <ngoldbaum> but better than the nazis i guess!
[02:04:11] <dimadima> yeah my family fled the nazis but not the soviet union
[02:04:15] <gwozniak> I recently found out that my great-grandmother was a Polish Jew
[02:04:23] <ngoldbaum> my grandfather was a communist
[02:04:57] <gwozniak> My great-grandfather fled Ukraine around the time of the 1905 revolution
[02:05:00] <dimadima> gwozniak: so you're a semi-recent American too
[02:05:07] <gwozniak> Canadian
[02:05:15] <dimadima> i was hoping America would cover my bases
[02:05:24] <gwozniak> North American :)
[02:05:28] <dimadima> yeah exactly :)
[02:05:58] <dimadima> ngoldbaum: have never heard of ppl fleeing the soviet union during WWII
[02:06:14] <dimadima> most 1905 times like gwozniak's
[02:06:30] <dimadima> my family long hauled it and fled in 1989 :|
[02:06:35] <ngoldbaum> fleeing *to* the soviet union
[02:06:44] <ngoldbaum> i don’t think a lot of people did it
[02:06:58] <dimadima> oh my bad i misread that
[02:07:01] <dimadima> that makes a lot more sense
[02:07:11] <dimadima> did they get stuck? re-patriated after the war?
[02:07:47] <ngoldbaum> yeah they got shipped to a work camp in tajikstan and then went back to poland after the war and came to the US when they couldn’t find any surviving family
[02:07:59] <dimadima> my grandmother's cousin fled to the USSR and then to the far east w/ them, but that's the only poland person i know who did the poland->USSR move during WWII
[02:08:07] <dimadima> ah okay
[02:08:14] <ngoldbaum> they were living in warsaw in 1939 so they would have been in the ghetto then shipped to treblinka
[02:08:24] <dimadima> yeah that same cousin went back to poland too and then got pogromed!
[02:08:31] <dimadima> so he fled again but to palestine lol
[02:08:33] <dimadima> :/
[02:09:05] <dimadima> yeah poland was a bummer during WWII
[02:11:21] <ngoldbaum> dimadima: otoh it was really easy to vanity search my papers on NASA’s astronomy literature search system
[02:11:29] <ngoldbaum> just “^goldbaum”
[02:11:36] <gwozniak> heh
[02:11:38] <Brekkjern> Poland's had it pretty rough in general...
[02:11:38] <ngoldbaum> ^ means first author
[02:12:08] <dimadima> ngoldbaum: heh that's cool
[02:12:24] <gwozniak> Brekkjern: I have a couple books on the history of Poland I've been meaning to read.  I can tell it's a complicated, messy history
[02:12:40] <dimadima> yeah i just learned the other day nazis killed polish intellegencia in general
[02:12:42] <dimadima> so brutal
[02:12:51] <dimadima> saw a photo of school teachers being lined up to be executed
[02:13:33] <dimadima> i read this the other year, it was pretty interesting, though a bit repetative: https://www.amazon.com/Yankels-Tavern-Liquor-Kingdom-Poland/dp/019998851X

[02:15:47] <dimadima> ngoldbaum: i take it you don't do astronomy these days?
[02:16:41] <ngoldbaum> nope i was getting seriously burned out helping to run an academic open source software project and decided to leave the field
[02:17:22] <dimadima> can we connect on linked in
[02:17:23] <ngoldbaum> there’s no career path for software people in academia and i was getting disollusioned
[02:17:46] <dimadima> oh you wanted to do software even in academia-astonomy?
[02:17:50] <dimadima> astronomy
[02:18:03] <ngoldbaum> i was for a while
[02:18:49] <ngoldbaum> it’s stupid that every grad student needs to reinvent the wheel constantly because no one sees value in community-maintained tools
[02:18:54] <manicennui> https://www.reddit.com/r/PeopleFuckingDying/comments/pk9k5e/greedy_fat_cat_tries_to_commit_insurance_fraud/
[02:18:55] <buttsbot> grEEdY fAT cAt tRiEs tO cOmMit inSuRAnce FrAuD : PeopleFuckingDying
[02:19:11] <ngoldbaum> or worse than that they see competitive value in siloed proprietary software
[02:19:43] <dimadima> yeah i've heard that a lot about physics phds for some reason
[02:21:01] <dimadima> i did bad enough in college i didn't see it continuing well into grad scchool
[02:27:56] <manicennui> I solved that problem by not even starting.
[02:29:28] <dimadima> yeah
[02:30:24] <dimadima> college sucks
[02:30:34] <dimadima> i mean, i really appreciate that i went to college and i think i learned a bunch but
[02:30:39] <dimadima> for me the pacing was totally wrong
[02:30:55] <dimadima> lectures just aren't my thing. unless they're recorded and i can pause/play whenever
[02:31:31] <dimadima> once i miss something in a lecture i can't really keep following it
[02:32:00] <dimadima> i don't get how ppl keep taking notes when they don't even understand what they mean
[02:32:04] <Brekkjern> That is becoming much more common now
[02:32:17] <dimadima> that just pissed me off to no end
[02:32:19] <dimadima> that' sgood
[02:32:24] <manicennui> Lectures are a pretty terrible way to communicate a bunch of facts.
[02:32:49] <Brekkjern> Lectures are actually kinda pointless nowadays as they have pre-recorded lectures that you have to watch before the actual lectures, and by then it's just review and eventual questions.
[02:33:14] <dimadima> that would have been a really pro approach to college
[02:33:23] <dimadima> if lecture-based learning in general
[02:33:23] <Brekkjern> I just wish the profs would use the same library that 3 blue 1 brown uses to make his animations to explain shit
[02:33:35] <manicennui> dimadima: There are seminar based schools.
[02:33:37] <Brekkjern> Because AVL tree rotations are still fucking black magic ofr me
[02:33:39] <dimadima> but i would have prefered to just read books, having someone to ask questions at during office hours
[02:33:52] <dimadima> and then have groups to study with or something
[02:34:04] <dimadima> manicennui: yeah that would have been good for me
[02:34:18] <manicennui> They tend to be liberal arts schools though, not STEM.
[02:34:38] <dimadima> yeah. i thought about st johns but it was too impractical
[02:35:09] <dimadima> i wanted to learn science/math more properly than historically
[02:35:17] <dimadima> i knew at least that much
[02:35:19] <Brekkjern> This picture is so damn absurd: https://i.redd.it/5sietskncbm71.jpg
[02:35:41] <dimadima> what do they have there
[02:35:55] <dimadima> is that... a ski?
[02:35:58] <Brekkjern> Picture from the Norwegian embassy in Afghanistan
[02:36:08] <dimadima> i like how they go all over the place w/ their guns like that
[02:36:10] <Brekkjern> The Taliban is rummaging through it, and they found those skiis
[02:36:20] <manicennui> dimadima: St John's program includes math and science.
[02:36:34] <dimadima> that one dude is wearing a baseball cap that looks like a startup of osme kind
[02:36:48] <dimadima> manicennui: yeah but my understanding is it was approached historically
[02:37:10] <dimadima> like, you would have a tough time applying for grad school (haha) for science from st johns
[02:37:24] <dimadima> could definitely be wrong though, that was just my impression
[02:37:37] <manicennui> I don't actually think that is true.
[02:37:38] <dimadima> Brekkjern: why did norway flee?
[02:37:44] <Brekkjern> dimadima: Everyone did
[02:37:48] <dimadima> manicennui: that would be good
[02:37:57] <dimadima> Brekkjern: a bunch of countries stayed? russia/china
[02:38:04] <dimadima> was norway part of the alliance?
[02:38:19] <Brekkjern> IIRC, Russia pulled out afterwards? Can't quite remember.
[02:38:26] <Brekkjern> Norway was part of the NATO coalition, yeah.
[02:38:36] <dimadima> well yeah they have to leave in that case
[02:38:41] <dimadima> you'd think
[02:38:43] <dimadima> but i don't know, i wonder
[02:38:57] <dimadima> i think the west is goign to try and turn these guys into the saudis
[02:39:09] <dimadima> or maybe like pakistan
[02:39:15] <Brekkjern> I think they will have to do it themselves to be honest...
[02:39:20] <manicennui> Getting an undergraduate degree in mathematics might be a cleaner path, but St. Johns degrees are generally pretty well respected.
[02:39:59] <dimadima> manicennui: well it's too late for me anyway :<
[02:40:18] <dimadima> would have probably been pretty good for me
[02:40:20] <manicennui> I know there are quite a few people who went from St. Johns to work as software engineers.
[02:40:33] <dimadima> though who knows i often think maybe st johns is bullshit too
[02:40:43] <manicennui> What I think schools like St. John's do is what most universities actually claim to do: teach people who to think.
[02:40:43] <dimadima> my college experience was very different than how it was sold to me
[02:40:58] <manicennui> s/who/how/
[02:41:00] <dimadima> i wouldn't be surprised if that was bullshit
[02:41:08] <dimadima> wouldn't be surprised if that was true, either
[02:41:21] <dimadima> but i'm prety jaded about college at this point
[02:42:10] <dimadima> like, uchicago was supposed to be some nerd promised land
[02:42:13] <dimadima> but that was a lie
[02:42:27] <dimadima> there were nerds, but not as many as you'd think/want
[02:42:42] <dimadima> many/most of the profs were there to autofellate themselves
[02:42:49] <dimadima> as were the students
[02:42:52] <manicennui> Ultimately most schools just want a lot of people enrolled.
[02:42:57] <dimadima> lots of circle jerking
[02:43:10] <dimadima> and a lot of ppl who couldn't write well, including myself lol to be honest
[02:43:20] <dimadima> manicennui: yeah
[02:43:28] <dimadima> uchicago wants rich kid dollarz
[02:43:36] <dimadima> like all other top 15 schools
[02:43:46] <manicennui> Foreign students are often a great source of tuition.
[02:43:54] <dimadima> thats the one thing that suggests st johns might be legit, they don't jockey for status far as i've seen

[12:44:18] <gerikson> I might start small by adding a GPS reciever to my current Pi
[12:44:46] <gerikson> it's been serving me faithfully as a torrent box for some time but this used NUC I got from work smokes it ;)
[12:45:47] <Brekkjern> Yeah. A NUC is so laughably more powerfull :P
[12:46:03] <gerikson> ironically only 100SEK more expensive ;)
[12:46:20] <gerikson> but a Pi4 is amazingly good value for what it is
[12:46:28] <Brekkjern> Yep
[12:46:54] <Brekkjern> The problem with a NUC is that you need to buy memory and a storage medium if it's not bundled
[12:47:11] <gerikson> work was selling off a bunch
[12:47:14] <Brekkjern> That can increase the cost a lot
[12:47:20] <gerikson> I believe  I have 16G memory
[12:47:26] <gerikson> 256G storage
[12:47:28] <Brekkjern> If so I would have been buying a handful :P
[12:47:39] <gerikson> don't really need more computers :D
[12:47:40] <Brekkjern> They are excellent as worker nodes in a kubernetes cluster.

[16:03:50] <buttsbot> Progress on C23 | Lobsters
[16:08:51] <gerikson> ``Action: changed tags from "python security databases api web programming debugging performance" to "web"''
[16:31:44] <gwozniak> Yeah, loved that one :)
[16:37:40] <gwozniak> I'm in agreement with david_chisnall: if had to choose between C and C++ for writing an application on basically anything, I'd pick C++
[16:38:27] <gwozniak> C is just a shitty language for apps
[16:39:13] <companion_cube> same
[16:39:15] <gwozniak> And yes, ISO C is very thin. You don't want that.
[16:39:33] <companion_cube> and you can still expose a C API if you want
[16:43:08] <gwozniak> Frankly, C is a shitty language, but whatever
[16:44:51] <gwozniak> There is a such a huge amount of legacy C code out there, though, that will not be rewritten any time soon so it's folly to think C is dead.  Our customers are prime examples
[16:48:55] <companion_cube> it'll just go the way of cobol :)
[16:49:34] <gwozniak> Frankly, I would like to see MS just say "we are no longer going to support C changes in out compiler".  Then maybe a shift would really start to happen. They barely support it now.
[16:50:23] <gwozniak> The microcontroller and firmware world will take a while to move away from C.  There are still some who insist on doing it all in assembler
[16:50:41] <gwozniak> As in, "the compiler is a bad tool" kind of attitude
[16:50:54] <gwozniak> Not many of them around, mind you, but they're there
[16:53:15] <companion_cube> when they die, though, it'll be over
[16:53:17] <companion_cube> (or retire)
[16:53:27] <gwozniak> These are people who think -O2 is not to be trusted, but laugh at the shitty code generated at -O0
[16:53:52] <gwozniak> Yes, they will be retiring soon. The hope is they didn't train too many others
[16:54:38] <companion_cube> people who want -O1 then? :D
[16:54:59] <gwozniak> -O1 is morally equivalent to -O2
[16:55:09] <companion_cube> hopefully compcert will make them happy :-°
[16:55:14] <gwozniak> Because turning on the optimizer "wrecks my code"
[16:55:24] <prussian> -Ofast or bust.
[16:55:36] <gwozniak> -Os or bust
[16:55:49] <prussian> but, it doesn't have the word fast in it.
[16:56:02] <gwozniak> Loop unrolling is a questionable thing on microcontrollers
[16:56:11] <gwozniak> As is inlining, frankly
[16:56:18] <prussian> but, fast.
[16:56:38] <prussian> idk. I'd rather pick neither, frankly.
[16:56:42] <gwozniak> You're mostly waiting for interrupts
[16:57:08] <gwozniak> And sometimes you have real time requirements, like "this cannot finish before X milliseconds"
[16:57:30] <gwozniak> So NOPs are required
[16:57:40] <gwozniak> __asm__("nop") ftw
[16:58:07] <prussian> such is life.
[16:58:17] <gwozniak> Honestly, we barely hear complaints about speed.  It's always "make this code smaller"
[16:58:21] <prussian> if it wasn't obvious, I was joking.
[16:58:33] <gwozniak> Yeah, I figured :)
[16:59:07] <gwozniak> If we can save 100 bytes on a 10Kb project, it's a win
[16:59:13] <Geekingfrog> finish *before* X ms ???
[16:59:20] <prussian> damn...
[16:59:29] <Geekingfrog> what kind of constraints would dictate such requirements?
[16:59:43] <gwozniak> Motor controls
[17:00:07] <Geekingfrog> What happens if you finish too soon?
[17:00:19] <gwozniak> It may rotate something too early, for example
[17:03:37] <prussian> in that linked comment. just started reading, but I have seen successful "append only" additions to structs work around ABI breaks.
[17:03:44] <companion_cube> tbh sounds like Ada would be nice
[17:03:45] <gwozniak> There could be a requirement that something must occur every X ms, with some tolerance, and it may or may not be tied to an interrupt generated by an outside event
[17:03:45] <gwozniak> So you have to write your loop so that it takes precisely some number of cycles on the hardware, hence, you count the instructions.  Usually better to write that in assembler directly, but not everyone does.
[17:03:50] <prussian> not that I agree with such gross demons
[17:04:53] <gwozniak> companion_cube: I have no objections to Ada. I need to try it out, but what I've seen is encouraging. Maybe getting out customers to use that would be easier than Rust. Who knows.
[17:05:02] <gwozniak> *our customers
[17:05:13] <companion_cube> I mean it seems designed for embedded
[17:05:22] <companion_cube> whereas rust is designed for high-perf desktop applications, at its core
[17:05:37] <gwozniak> It's a long game to move people away from C, mainly because of existing code bases
[17:05:58] <gwozniak> Lots of new microcontroller projects start out using an old one as a start
[17:06:04] <companion_cube> tiny microcontrollers are really their own thing anyway
[17:06:09] <companion_cube> personally I don't care if they still use C
[17:06:14] <companion_cube> it's a different world
[17:06:29] <companion_cube> I just wish we'd stop using C on anything that runs linux (yes, I know)
[17:06:34] <gwozniak> Or they base it on the old code and buy parts that are close to the previous ones, just faster
[17:06:56] <gwozniak> Yeah, getting C out of the systems programming world would be nice
[17:07:15] <gwozniak> But I'd like to see firmware not written in C
[17:07:26] <gwozniak> Things like Wifi and Bluetooth stacks, for example
[17:08:06] <prussian> meh. I was fucking around with c++20 ranges yesterday, and then I realized, Rust just does it better.
[17:08:08] <prussian> simple as that.
[17:08:08] <gwozniak> 8-bit parts are a special world, to some degree.  16- and 32-bit are less so
[17:09:13] <companion_cube> prussian: or D
[17:09:24] <companion_cube> I heard D with -betterC is not bad
[17:09:39] <companion_cube> sadly it's too late for adoption I think
[17:09:50] <gwozniak> The only thing special about 32-bit parts are the memory constraints.  The arch/ISA isn't too weird
[17:10:03] <prussian> wouldn't know. I just know that C++ still annoys me and I'm tired of seeing emails like "xyz server constantly crashes at customer site abc." and similar things.
[17:10:05] <gwozniak> Yeah, D is kind of a "nice try" thing
[17:10:25] <gwozniak> Don't get me wrong, I don't like C++
[17:10:38] <prussian> I like it more than C
[17:10:43] <prussian> that's about it.
[17:10:45] <gwozniak> Yah
[17:11:27] <gerikson> lopl
[17:11:30] <companion_cube> I think Zig will eat what remains of D
[17:11:36] <gerikson> damning with faint praise
[17:11:36] <prussian> perhaps I am delusional, but I have not seen "clean C" outside of extremely basic bitch problems.
[17:12:15] <companion_cube> I've seen nice algorithmic C, but it takes years of work, where C++ would probably be more efficient
[17:12:21] <prussian> man c++20 stuff is just weird.
[17:12:25] <companion_cube> and these projects tend to move to C++ if there's more than a few people involved
[17:13:53] <prussian> we must RIIR
[17:14:05] <prussian> in both a sarcastic and semi-serious sense.
[17:21:52] <companion_cube> honestly? rust isn't perfect, but it sure beats C and C++
[17:44:26] <gerikson> am I out of the loop for only learning about Gnu Shepherd like, this week?

[19:35:57] <manicennui> I did not think that there was a streaming video player out there worse than HBO Max, but Funimation is way worse.
[19:36:10] <Brekkjern> Try HBO Nordic...
[19:36:11] <manicennui> At least the web browser version.
[19:36:46] <Brekkjern> They are retiring the video player of HBO Nordic to upgrade to HBO Max...
[19:36:57] <manicennui> Funimation web player switches the language choice back to Portuguese every episode, and the next episode button doesn't work if it is full screen.
[19:37:31] <Brekkjern> Ah. HBO Nordic just reduces the colour space and lowers the bitrate when there are a lot of simultaneous streams.
[19:37:45] <Brekkjern> So if you think Game of Thrones was dark when you saw it on HBO Max...
[19:37:48] <dasm> manicennui: sounds like a lot of fun (bad joke)
[19:37:59] <manicennui> And neither the web player nor the Roku app will go to the next episode automatically until each episode is completely over, credits and all.
[19:38:11] <manicennui> And they don't skip the recaps at the beginning of every episode.
[19:39:29] <Brekkjern> Plex sounds better :P
[19:39:29] <manicennui> Web player also tells me that a video isn't available sometimes and I have to go back to the show page and click the episode to start it again, then switch the language, then manually skip the recap...
[19:40:16] <manicennui> Fortunately the main problem with the Roku app is just that it doesn't skip the recap and makes you watch the credits until you manually advance to the next episode.
[19:40:29] <manicennui> I just don't understand how these companies do such a shitty job.

[20:06:02] <prussian> simple.
[20:06:15] <manicennui> Yeah.
[20:06:22] <prussian> also browser = bad
[20:06:30] <manicennui> I just don't think we are talking about a ton of money to make it not suck.
[20:06:37] <prussian> because hackermens and uh, something about app conversions and spywere
[20:06:38] <prussian> ware
[20:06:43] <manicennui> I get that skipping recaps and credits is probably a lot of work.
[20:06:54] <prussian> I wonder if they just pay interns to do it
[20:06:55] <prussian> lol
[20:06:59] <manicennui> But just make the buttons work and use the language that is actually selected in my preferences.
[20:07:18] <prussian> "ok interns, we have a crisis. We have exabytes of video we need you to tag the start and end of."
[20:08:28] <prussian> i remember one such crisis at one internshit where they made us do bitchwork to send out "oopsies, our recently acquired competitor didn't do something legal" and we had to hand fax a bunch of these to a bunch of doctors.
[20:08:39] <manicennui> I googled it and many other people have the exact same problems with the next episode button and the language switching to Portuguese every episode.
[20:08:47] <prussian> lmao
[20:09:40] <manicennui> Fortunately we have a group of people we call "strategy and operations" who clean up problems.
[20:09:48] <prussian> anyhow. I just have some nonfree crapware ARM box that does all the video streaming cancer.
[20:09:51] <manicennui> They are basically business analysts.
[20:09:56] <prussian> #yolo as they say
[20:11:00] <prussian> manicennui: idk, do they clean up problems or just deflect and mitigate?
[20:11:15] <manicennui> They clean them up.

[23:03:05] <manicennui> Why do people mount their TVs so high on the wall?
[23:03:13] <manicennui> Do they enjoy neck strain?

[23:08:50] <manicennui> That's a house.
[23:09:34] <prussian> imagine the property taxes.
[23:10:15] <manicennui> You don't have to imagine. Just scroll down.
[23:10:32] <manicennui> 2019	$18,852
[23:11:07] <prussian> damn.
[23:11:32] <manicennui> That place is amazing though.
[23:11:36] <manicennui> And the location is amazing.
[23:12:10] <manicennui> It's less than a block away from a bunch of great restaurants, and less than half a mile from a very trendy area with all kinds of stuff.
[23:12:11] <prussian> what blows my mind is that would probably sell.
[23:12:24] <manicennui> If I had that kind of money I'd buy it.
[23:12:41] <manicennui> Consider that that is super cheap compared to NYC/SF Bay.
[23:12:49] <prussian> 470% ROI though since last "sale price" according to this site
[23:12:51] <prussian> lol
[23:12:53] <prussian> jesus
[23:13:26] <manicennui> Sold in 2012.
[23:13:34] <manicennui> And based on the price, it was almost certainly completely redone.
[23:13:52] <manicennui> It was probably nothing like that before.
[23:14:02] <prussian> https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/brazilian-viper-venom-may-become-tool-fight-against-coronavirus-study-shows-2021-08-31/ <- let's go. lol
[23:14:02] <buttsbot> Brazilian viper venom may become tool in fight against COVID,  study shows | Reuters
[23:14:14] <prussian> manicennui: ya. still nuts
[23:14:30] <prussian> I don't know, i'd just say no to any job in or around that area.
[23:14:31] <manicennui> I bet the tore down the original house.
[23:14:36] <prussian> or REMOTE
[23:14:50] <manicennui> What do you mean?
[23:15:05] <manicennui> Most jobs in Chicago that pay enough to own that are going to be downtown.
[23:15:14] <manicennui> Most of the jobs in that neighborhood are going to be service industry.
[23:15:52] <manicennui> You can find more affordable places in that neighborhood.
[23:15:56] <manicennui> Just not large houses like that.
[23:16:23] <dmc> also these guys stay super active https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/graphs/contributors

[23:18:47] <dmc> I like those doors
[23:19:04] <dmc> that look fake
[23:19:52] <manicennui> The painted 2 panel doors?
[23:24:31] <dmc> yeah
[23:31:03] <manicennui> Looks like you can get a decent condo in that area (Wicker Park) for $400-600k.
[23:35:12] <prussian> manicennui: neat
[23:35:33] <prussian> I could get a townhouse near my work for only 150k... damn.
[23:35:43] <manicennui> Yes, but then you'd have to live in CT.
[23:35:57] <prussian> ya it's ok
[23:36:04] <prussian> idk.
[23:36:14] <prussian> maybe I should move back to California
[23:36:15] <manicennui> Wicker Park is one of the most desirable neighborhoods in Chicago.
[23:36:25] <manicennui> prussian: Depends on what you want really.
[23:36:39] <manicennui> I'm sure parts of CT are great depending on what you want.
[23:36:43] <prussian> and then I can die in a wildfire or earthquake lol
[23:36:52] <prussian> CT is basically one giant suburbia.
[23:37:01] <prussian> well, where people actually live anyhow.
[23:37:21] <prussian> Though I hear New Haven is the new hotness.
[23:37:36] <manicennui> I can't live in a suburban environment again.
[23:37:49] <manicennui> It has to be very urban or somewhat rural.
[23:38:05] <prussian> the scent of fresh cut grass, painting siding, weed whacking.
[23:38:07] <prussian> idk.
[23:38:10] <prussian> so simple.
[23:39:55] <manicennui> Is there anything to do other than shop and work?
[23:41:00] <manicennui> I feel like most suburbs are places to shop, and large houses to store all the crap you buy.
[23:41:20] <manicennui> And mostly terrible employers.
[23:41:33] <manicennui> With a few exceptions like companies that require a lot of land, like Fermilab.
[23:42:13] <prussian> ya, maintaining the home.
[23:42:17] <prussian> always something to do.
[23:42:37] <prussian> I don't know man.
[23:59:35] <dimadima> me neither
