[00:59:35] <manicennui> In the US at least, software development can be considered capex in some cases.

[14:58:03] <riv> someone asked a math problem that's bugging the hell out of me
[14:58:27] <riv> if you have a bunch of marbles, 15 different colors, known counts (e.g. 5 pink, 7 red ..)
[14:58:54] <riv> you pull 6 out the bag randomly, what's the probability of having at least 3 different colors
[14:59:17] <riv> I feel like I could make a computer program to run a simulation.. but no idea how to work out a formula.. anyone know?
[15:06:52] <edk> you can normally work this thing out directly but it's tedious and it does feel like there should be a nice answer
[15:06:59] <edk> i don't know what the nice answer would be
[15:07:46] <riv> https://stats.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Probability_Theory/Probability_Mathematical_Statistics_and_Stochastic_Processes_(Siegrist)/12%3A_Finite_Sampling_Models/12.03%3A_The_Multivariate_Hypergeometric_Distribution i came across this, which is close... but it only gives you an answer for things like the probability of 'exactly 3 reds, exactly 6 blues, ..'
[15:07:46] <buttsbot> 12.3: The Multivariate Hypergeometric Distribution - Statistics LibreTexts
[15:08:17] <riv> so you could sum all of these up for all possibilities.. but at that point, you're just doing a slightly optimized simulating it

[15:22:35] <riv> hmm
[15:22:37] <riv> in terms of google fu
[15:22:55] <riv> I think this was originally about cards, probability of getting at least of X, Y and Z kind of thing
[15:23:18] <riv> but I haven't been getting anything that hits the nail on the head from google
[15:30:15] <edk> i feel like it's going to involve a multiset coefficient then counting all the combinations you shouldn't have counted
[15:30:41] <edk> but i'm not very good at this and i don't have time to spend an hour failing at it
[15:31:21] <riv> yeah I think that a big inclusion exclusion sum for the negation may be the simplest thing we can get
[15:31:54] <riv> that's a sum with 2^N terms I think
[15:35:25] <edk> well if you start with n multichoose k you only need to exclude all the ways to choose one or two colors, no?
[15:36:29] <riv> I'm not sure - in my mind it explodes a bit because of all the possibilities. I could be wrong though

[22:02:27] <gthm> epilys: a friend works at github, remotely, and says they're desperate for people
[22:09:19] <ben> i put my resume in to github and got a rejection email within a day or two
[22:09:23] <ben> they can't be that desperate
[22:15:36] <jackalope00> ben: Automated resume scanner go brrrr
[22:15:52] <gerikson> lol this is a good rant gemini://nomadpengu.in/thoughts/agony/

[22:15:57] <jackalope00> I've got a buddy who included about 2,000 keywords in the margins of his PDF version, in tiny white text, to avoid them.
[22:16:06] <gerikson> jackalope00: LOL
[22:17:13] <manicennui> Is he a recent college grad?
[22:17:53] <jackalope00> Yep.
[22:18:03] <jackalope00> It actually worked for a few internships.
[22:18:13] <ben> lol nice
[22:19:30] <gthm> I guess this is why knowing people helps a lot
[22:20:21] <ben> mhm
[22:23:40] <gthm> if I were the thinkleading type, I'd write a blog post about how it's weird that tech is the only part of human activities that operates strictly on merit and is immune to the influence of personal relationships, in a start refutation of all of recorded history
[22:23:47] <jackalope00> gthm: Honestly yeah.  My good positions have always been through an introduction/relationship, not a form application.
[22:24:20] <gthm> alas, I'm not the thoughleading type
[22:24:52] <gerikson> lol this headline is hard to parse "Meta axes head of global community development embroiled in underage sex sting"
[22:25:04] <jackalope00> There's some merit to hiring based on personal relationships: while a résumé or interview can give some ideas about someone's technical proficiency, neither really works to measure integrity and reliability.  Those are much better measured through relationships, references, et cetera.
[22:25:34] <jackalope00> gerikson: Hmm, I wasn't aware Meta has a department of gloabl community development embroiled in underage sex sting...
[22:25:42] <jackalope00> Whose headline?
[22:25:54] <gthm> jackalope00: I've gotten 2 jobs out of 4 from knowing someone. the ones where I knew someone were much better experiences in the long run
[22:26:42] <gerikson> jackalope00: TechCrap
[22:27:12] <gthm> the most recent job I got basically passed all of my filters because this guy I know works there and he wouldn't be there if they weren't good people
[22:27:32] <gthm> and I'm sure I passed most of their filters for the same reason
[22:28:45] <jackalope00> Similar experiences.  I'm sympathetic to the concerns some people raise about bringing in outside perspectives and not operating within a "boys' club", but I've also seen too many fruit loops who no one at a company knew pass the screenings and turn out badly.
[22:29:15] <jackalope00> I think linkedin is helpful here: I can see if someone has worked with another person I know and reach out to get an assessment of him.
[22:31:02] <gerikson> but this means that the only people in a company will be "well-rounded" ;)
[22:31:29] <gerikson> your typical, abrasive, brilliant, tell-you-how-it-is NERD has no chance!!
[22:31:45] <gerikson> sorry riffing off a dumb HN comment
[22:32:12] <jackalope00> > dumb HN comment
[22:32:12] <jackalope00> That doesn't narrow it down much :)
[22:32:29] <gerikson> touché
[22:33:26] <edk> i mean
[22:33:53] <edk> doing it via "networking" seems biased as heck
[22:34:08] <edk> but also any old abrasive brilliant nerd can just learn to be good at interviewing
[22:34:15] <gerikson> think of it as a directed, weighted fraph
[22:34:40] <gthm> gerikson: yeah, won't someone think of the assholes!
[22:34:49] <jackalope00> edk: Biased, yes, but based on factors for which a bias is appropriate.  Sociability and willingness to improve one's social skills are valuable, even among engineers.
[22:35:07] <edk> yeah but using linkedin isn't
[22:36:02] <jackalope00> It's not "using linkedin" by just connecting with random people.  It's more towards the idea of making introductions via a mutual acquaintance.
[22:36:27] <jackalope00> Think of it like PGP's "web of trust" model.
[22:36:32] <edk> connecting with random people involves logging into linkedin
[22:36:48] <edk> also, more concretely, it makes you more doxable
[22:37:16] <gthm> is that a threat in the context of finding a job?
[22:37:28] <edk> the context of finding a job isn't relevant
[22:37:37] <jackalope00> Right, I'm not suggesting that one ought to connect with random people.  Linkedin does serve as a useful tool to find out if I have a mutual acquaintance with someone.
[22:37:57] <gerikson> jackalope00: "web of trust"  just means "I assert that this key belongs to this person", nothing about wehter that person is trustworthy ;)
[22:38:11] <edk> if you don't want to be doxed you can't """""network""""" on linkedin; it doesn't matter why you wanted to network
[22:38:17] <gerikson> also PGP is basically all abrasive nerds
[22:38:21] <edk> rude
[22:38:22] <gthm> gerikson: sure, but you see what they really mean
[22:38:26] <jackalope00> gerikson: True enough.  But within professional circles, people tend to "network" based on trust and mutual relationships.  Just an example.
[22:38:35] <gerikson> sure I agree
[22:38:57] <jackalope00> edk: Yes, if you have no desire to go meet lots of other people for fear of privacy, you can reasonably expect to have fewer social connections and a correspondingly-reduced number of opportunities available to you.
[22:39:09] <edk> i feel like you may be missing the point on purpose tbh
[22:39:32] <edk> meeting people isn't the problem, having details of your workplace available on the internet is
[22:40:00] <jackalope00> edk: No, I sympathize with the argument that one might not want a large amount of information concerning his personal and professional presence available on the internet.  But, it's also the way most people work these days.
[22:40:18] <jackalope00> I can't see a better way of making networking that easy without making information widely available.
[22:40:20] <edk> yes, but tying one's identity to one's career doesn't seem like a good thing to select for particularly
[22:41:06] <jackalope00> It's the status quo for most American adults, especially men.  One can run a personal internet presence such as a blog or video channel while still maintaining a professional one.
[22:41:15] <gthm> it's not like people have one online identity they tie to everything. I have a "professional" online identity, and various "yolo" ones that, as far as any casual observer knows, are separate
[22:41:38] <gthm> just like people do in real life, where they behave differently depending on group context
[22:41:48] <jackalope00> Exactly.  This account is not closely tied to my professional identity, though I suppose one could probably establish a connection between the two with sufficient time spent googling.
[22:41:53] <gerikson> here's an idea: don't be a dick (using your real name)
[22:42:11] <edk> you don't need to be a dick for people on the internet to decide to hate you
[22:43:00] <gerikson> sure, but their most immediate retaliation would be to try to get you fired, and if you're working at a job and did nothing wrong , you shouldn't be fired anyway
[22:43:08] <edk> nonsense
[22:43:20] <gerikson> this is a US problem in any case
[22:43:40] <gerikson> if the US had decent worker protections it would go away
[22:44:11] <edk> also not true, but i'm unwilling to give details
[22:44:12] <gerikson> but I agree the value of having pro/life accounts separate
[22:44:30] <edk> if we had pro/life names i might not mind that so much
[22:45:34] <gerikson> look, corporate work *does* select for a certain conformity
[22:45:40] <gerikson> but so does primary school
[22:45:57] <gerikson> and most social life, like clubs or churches
[22:46:26] <gerikson> the rewards for conforming are wages
[22:46:28] <gerikson> and pensions
[22:46:33] <gerikson> and good credit score
[22:46:41] <edk> and you think this is good, generally?
[22:46:54] <gthm> more like it's the way it is
[22:46:57] <jackalope00> It will be interesting to see how such expectations of a polished, professional presence and no "flamboyant" personal one change with younger generations.  Most very young people I know have too much on-line to present that exterior.  There are at least a few videos of almost everyone floating around on instagram where he is doing something
[22:46:57] <jackalope00> stupid.  Someone else then uploads it and tags him.
[22:47:20] <jackalope00> edk: Does not any team need to select for a certain degree of conformity?
[22:48:00] <edk> presumably they have requirements; it's just not obvious to me that "maintains a good linkedin account" predicts any of those requirements
[22:48:02] <gerikson> edk: I don't see any large harm - ofc if the conformity becomes so stifling it infringes on personal liberty
[22:48:05] <gerikson> it's a problem
[22:48:14] <edk> it does imo
[22:48:34] <edk> like i will have to be careful how much of my professional life leaks online pretty much forever because of the things i've done with this name
[22:49:07] <jackalope00> edk: It's not a solution, but I've found keeping most of my handles for a few months at most helps.
[22:49:18] <jackalope00> Or, treat them as though they're your professional name.
[22:49:57] <jackalope00> edk: I'm sure you'd rather not disclose details, but depending on the use of a particular name, its association with a company can harm the latter's brand.
[22:50:09] <edk> well i created the largest irc network in the world
[22:50:21] <edk> i don't regret that but it does draw attention from nasty people sometimes
[22:50:58] <jackalope00> Oh yeah, that makes sense.  That would make you a target for someone pulling a nasty quote from anywhere on the network and saying, "Look, everyone, edk permits this horrible content on his IRC!"
[22:51:14] <edk> what i'm worried about is pretty much the exact opposite
[22:51:25] <ngoldbaum> hey at least you didn’t turn the biggest irc network in the world into a shitty link aggregator
[22:51:30] <ngoldbaum> could do worse
[22:51:57] <gerikson> edk: you're in a minority, which basically means that you're not conforming , by definition
[22:51:59] <edk> someone nasty doesn't like me because of the online stuff, finds out where i work, invents some nasty stories to tell them
[22:52:16] <edk> i know people in similar positions who've had their lives turned upside down that way
[22:52:37] <edk> (some of them lived in northern europe)
[22:53:01] * ngoldbaum looks at freenode.net and laughs
[22:53:12] * manicennui explains tax withholding to a coworker.
[22:53:16] <jackalope00> edk: I agree that it's not good to fire based on stories especially.  I suppose this goes back to the "twitter mob" concern and would prefer if employers gave the benefit of the doubt to their employees.
[22:53:23] <manicennui> How does someone work for half a decade and not figure this stuff out?
[22:53:51] <gerikson> I was requested to put a disclaimer on my twitter for that very reason
[22:54:29] <gerikson> well everyone was
[22:54:32] <gerikson> policy
[22:55:02] <jackalope00> I think the bigger concern is that it's difficult for one to mentally firewall his two on-line personalities.  I've had friends who've accidentally let their pseudonymous personality slip into their professional ones, to bad results.  It's basically opsec, and people are, as a rule, very bad at opsec.
[22:55:05] <edk> jackalope00: yeah. but it's a difficult situation to make employers do that when nobody else does
[22:56:05] <jackalope00> edk: That's the thing, I don't believe there's an effective way to "make" employers do so that could delineate between cases of a "twitter mob" pitching a conniption fit and someone actually saying or doing something harmful to a company's image.
[22:56:24] <manicennui> Just work for a company with a horrible image!
[22:56:52] <jackalope00> This is more a social attitude towards 1. forgiveness for stupid remarks and 2. general irreverence.  Those aren't really fixable by legislation.
[22:56:54] <ngoldbaum> speaking of, $fb is down 45% over the past six months
[22:57:44] <gerikson> \o.
[22:57:49] <gerikson> \o/
[22:58:38] <gerikson> edk: you're sharing a life with people like convicted felons, or recovering substance abusers, or people with a background in adult entertainment
[22:58:52] <gerikson> it sucks and I hope people will get more accepting over time
[22:59:12] <edk> hah. yeah
[22:59:48] <gerikson> fwiw our kid had basic online hygiene education in primary shcool
[23:03:37] <cb> damn they teach you how to wipe your ass?
[23:07:55] <gerikson> lol
[23:15:57] <manicennui> gerikson: Did they teach them that IRC is evil?
[23:19:39] <gerikson> "IRC is an ancient protocol, used in the before times"
[23:19:52] <manicennui> They should show them the scene from Numbers.

[23:22:16] <bkero> crime ridden cities
[23:22:18] <bkero> lol
[23:22:32] <bkero> If you look at crime from a multi-decade scale it's way way way down
[23:22:40] <bkero> except of course media piracy. That's way up.
[23:22:42] <companion_cube> they must be thinking of tax evasion
[23:22:47] <manicennui> SF is filled with techbros running crypto scams. So sad.
[23:22:49] <gerikson> but scary black people are stealing Tide
[23:23:34] <bkero> Also you need to put a Paul Graham warning on that post.
[23:23:53] <manicennui> gerikson: They probably complain about drugs use while microdosing and taking adderall.
[23:24:55] <gerikson> hehe manicennui
[23:24:59] <gerikson> bkero: sorry
[23:25:41] <bkero> If Hacker News is Ycombinator's fleshlight, then Paul Graham is the fleshlight's fleshlight
[23:25:41] <gerikson> well expect Peter Theil to mount an app-driven takeover of the city and turn it into a racist theme park
[23:25:42] <manicennui> I'm sure one of the biggest reasons for the small bump in crime is that no one can afford to live there anymore because of these assholes.
[23:26:17] <manicennui> "Why are these poors doing crime?!"
[23:26:33] <gerikson> "why are they not coding?!"
[23:28:10] <bkero> This Just In: YCombinator in partnership with the city of San Francisco has been granted permission to shut the city's homeless services in favor of new coding bootcamps.

[23:46:41] <prussian> rip...
[23:46:59] <prussian> but I stocked up on various veterinary medicines.
[23:47:05] <manicennui> Findings  In this open-label randomized clinical trial of high-risk patients with COVID-19 in Malaysia, a 5-day course of oral ivermectin administered during the first week of illness did not reduce the risk of developing severe disease compared with standard of care alone.
[23:47:26] <prussian> is.... anyone shocked though?
[23:47:31] <jackalope00> I've heard the tabs/spaces may be due to the sorts of languages that use them.

[23:55:31] <manicennui> One theory is that it only actually helped people in developing countries where rates of worms are high.
[23:55:47] <manicennui> It was actually curing their worms which made their bodies more able to fight covid.
[23:56:57] <companion_cube> it kills covid in a petri dish, at concentrations that also kill humans
