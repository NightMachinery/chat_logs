[00:28:09] <jaggz> in pyplot, how can I access subplots sequentially?  Sometimes it's irritating, if I make a 3x2 set of plots, to not be able to go through each of them and set a setting (0..6)

[00:30:17] <SnoopJ> jaggz, it's relatively common when working with intricately structured plots to do: `fig, axes = plt.subplots(Nrow, Ncol)` where `axes` will be an array of Axes instances that you can then use via the object API

[02:00:33] <newdimension> I'm processing emails based on the from field. For each email I'm writing a function that uses regex to extract some info. Right now I just have a long If elif that calls the appropriate code. I'm trying to reorganize the code, and I'm thinking that create a dict rules = {from_email: function()} would be cleaner. Is creating a named function for
[02:00:33] <newdimension> each email cleaner that a long if elif ?

[05:50:33] <Capricious> So I wanted to use spaCy in Jupyter to basically teach myself some NLP extraction tasks.
[05:50:34] <SnoopJ> When you run spaCy from the command line, you're probably getting a small Python program that first does `import spacy` and then calls some functions in the library for you.

[05:53:04] <Capricious> Thank you!! I really appreciate this.
[05:53:30] <SnoopJ> Capricious, when you type a command into your shell program, the shell tries to figure out what program or command you want to run, usually by scanning over a list of files it knows about. When you type into a Jupyter notebook, you're writing Python code.
[05:54:11] <InPhase> Capricious: Chapter 1 of the SciPy lecture notes is "Getting started with Python for science".  You will probably benefit enormously from going through this.  And then, here is a spacy introduction guide to introductory usage of it from within Python:  https://spacy.io/usage/spacy-101
[05:54:18] <SnoopJ> So the shell gets `spacy` as input and goes off to try and find a file or command named `spacy` to run for you, running it if it does find one. And in Python it thinks `spacy` is a variable name, but the variable isn't defined, so it's a nameError.

[05:55:49] <InPhase> Capricious: You could of course jump straight to the spacy guide, but you will undoubtedly quickly get confused.  It will be worth going through the SciPy lectures first to power up so that the spacy usage makes sense.  While the library will do the heavy lifting for the hard stuff, you will very quickly need a Python foundation to make use of it for anything even exploratory.

[06:17:57] <SnoopJ> Capricious, using environments (virtual envs or conda) can be useful when you want to "isolate" the libraries you're using for a particular purpose. It does make cleaning up a lot tidier: you can often just delete an environment and re-create it if you get into trouble.

[06:19:04] <Capricious> SnoopJ: does recreating an environment involve reinstalling the libraries within it too?
[06:19:08] <SnoopJ> `venv` is a pretty good tool to be aware of, and you're already using `conda` so you might as well take some time to make sure you understand its environments, too. I would recommend doing those in that order, personally
[06:19:14] <SnoopJ> Capricious, usually, yes.
[06:19:41] <konfusedagain> SnoopJ: yeah just delete that project folder and its clean, you will just have base python installed , right ?
[06:19:50] <Capricious> I’m reading through this now: https://medium.com/@krishnaregmi/pipenv-vs-virtualenv-vs-conda-environment-3dde3f6869ed
[06:19:51] <SnoopJ> konfusedagain, right
[06:21:02] <Capricious> It doesn’t say a lot though about venv vs conda
[06:22:25] <SnoopJ> Capricious, `venv` is a tool for managing Python environments. The environments it creates will contain a Python interpreter and maybe some libraries. conda has its own concept of environments that possibly can include a Python interpreter and its libraries, but also a whoooole bunch of other things.
[06:22:49] <konfusedagain> hey SnoopJ  i have some ques about irc , can i dm ?
[06:23:05] <Capricious> There seems to be commentary on Stack that conda is ‘better’ because “combines the functionality of pip and virtualenv in a single package, so you do not need virtualenv if you are using conda.”
[06:23:12] <SnoopJ> konfusedagain, what kind of questions? The folks in #libera might be better able to help, depending on what you want to know.
[06:23:57] <SnoopJ> Capricious, that's probably a good sign to not pay close attention to that commentary, because "right" implies there is a single use-case which is foolish because these tools do very different jobs.
[06:24:36] <SnoopJ> Because `venv` is part of the standard library, you will probably inevitably run into it when working with Python. You *might* run into conda, but a lot of people never do. Some people like it as a tool, though.
[06:25:07] <Capricious> I already have conda/anaconda
[06:25:23] <Capricious> That’s where I was using Jupyter through. It never used to have PyCharm, now it has PyCharm too.
[06:25:42] <SnoopJ> Remember what I said about how taking it one thing at a time helps?
[06:26:04] <themill> Historically, the biggest appeal of conda was that numpy and scipy were so damned hard to compile on windows. That they finally got wheels changes that.

[09:02:17] <ztrawhcse> themill: what's the hardest part of compiling scipy on windows anyway? Is it just "installing a compiler on Windows is complicated so all compiled modules suck without wheels"?
[09:05:12] <themill> ztrawhcse: that's mostly the issue, yes. Anaconda's marketing was pretty heavily aimed at science/engineering/data applications where lack of numpy wheels was a showstopper.
[09:05:27] <Capricious> InPhase: thanks :)
[09:06:16] <themill> ztrawhcse: matching the compiler you were trying to use for your modules with the compiler that made the interpreter and the compiler that made any libraries you were wrapping was an additional complication.

Its been a while, but on *a* linux i've used, tkinter was installed with the stdlib IF a windowing system was installed, but it would not be on a headless system.  which makes sense.  Its also optional but default on windows.  The thing is... its not a third party module.  Authors still write for it as though it is always installed, because historically it was.  If you always had to install it
[20:53:02] <Tritium> separately and never made it to the stdlib, no one would use it in 2022

[23:15:49] <Dr-007> kostkon, someone pointed me towards python via #ubuntu and he said "python/glade to develop, then it works out of the box in most ubuntu live cds, libraries for that are preinstalled.

[23:19:24] <kostkon> Dr-007, doubt it would have worked out of the box. By the way, Ubuntu/Canonical recommends using Flutter to develop  Linux apps nowadays, I don't know if that is something you'd like to get your hands on. Furthermode, a more appropriate channel to ask about app development on Ubuntu would be #ubuntu-app-devel, #Ubuntu tends to be a general support channel most of the time

[23:30:34] <foo> This is an interesting one. I still don't know what I think. When does it make sense to "create a CONSTANT" ? I may have vocalized this in the past. For example, we have this: EXCEPTION_DUPLICATE_QB_CUSTOMER = "duplicate_qb_customer" ... and then we call "EXCEPTION_DUPLICATE_QB_CUSTOMER" 10 times. It is very easy to change this, should we ever want to. Alternatively, could have just used
[23:30:40] <foo> "duplicate_qb_customer" instead of defining a constant... I would really appreciate it a few folks in here answered A) I would define a constant for that or B) I would use a string, no constant needed for that
