[01:06:51] <Oberon4278> The man page I'm supposed to read for information is not helpful, and doesn't give any indication of where else I could go.
[01:06:57] <Khepra> did you run this interactively? on the shell?
[01:07:05] <Oberon4278> ran it from a shell yes
[01:07:29] <Khepra> iirc it should've offered a prompt you accept and it continues
[01:07:34] <Oberon4278> huh
[01:07:42] <Oberon4278> it didn't do that =(
[01:08:41] <somiaj> I do agree that that error pointing to apt-secure isn't that helpful (I think there is a bug about that)

[01:08:58] <somiaj> Oberon4278: use apt and not apt-get, which makes this even more confusing because they act differently here
[01:08:59] <Khepra> frankly I don't remember having to do that
[01:09:12] <Khepra> oh yes... I'm using apt, not apt-get
[01:09:21] <Oberon4278> interesting, what search terms did you use, Khepra?
[01:09:23] <somiaj> I think the idea is apt-get is meant to be run in scripts, and scripts shouldn't be given prompts, 'do you want to do this', and apt is meant to be run by users, and thus uses should get and answer prompts
[01:09:36] <Khepra> Oberon4278: https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-e&q=apt+update+accept+version+change+oldstable
[01:10:12] <Oberon4278> okay, and how did you select those specific terms?  I tried googling it (but I don't remember the terms I used) and that wasn't in my results

[01:11:24] <somiaj> Oberon4278: took my fingers a while to get use to typing apt instead of apt-get, but when running apt from the command line and looking at the output, it is nicer and worth training your fingers to get use to
[01:11:42] <Oberon4278> I didn't know about the difference between apt and apt-get, for some reason I thought apt-get was the preferred utility
[01:11:53] <Oberon4278> okay, cool

[01:12:35] <somiaj> In this case, apt-get is now used in so many scripts, it needs to have a very controled and stable api, so apt was introduced to allow something to give nicer output and not have to be forced to have such a stable api, because apt shouldn't be used in scripts (and warns users if you try to pipe its output for instance)
[01:13:05] <somiaj> karlpinc: but it has purty colors....I still find I use a mix of the two, but more and more I just use apt.

[01:14:47] <somiaj> haha, well it depends on what kinda of output you want. I see this as apt-get being used in so many different scripts was kinda just feature frozen, hence apt allows things to change, though maybe in ways some don't agree with.

[01:23:34] <Khepra> weird that there's no metapackage
[01:24:58] <cosimone> i personally don't think that "java" is as unambiguous as you believe, but you could "officially" propose adding a virtual/metapackage named as such, if you provide the right reasons
[01:25:32] <Oberon4278> I get that there are a bunch of options, but there is absolutely no reason why we shouldn't have a package called "java" that just contains a reasonable set of basics
[01:26:00] <dodo> what are the basics? jre? jdk?

[01:28:23] <cosimone> btw, maybe i'm ignorant, but do you know of any distribution which provides a "java" metapackage that just does what you'd want?
[01:28:41] <Oberon4278> no

[01:30:50] <Oberon4278> yeah
[01:31:22] <cosimone> i see.  i don't know much about that specific system, maybe they had their own java metapackage?
[01:31:35] <Oberon4278> but they provided a ton of custom made utilities to make their customers' lives easier, and I keep assuming that those are just basic Unix utilities and then being annoyed that they don't exist
[01:32:28] <Oberon4278> They definitely provided a lot of that kind of thing, but I doubt "metapackage" would have been the terminology they used since this was back in about 2005
[01:32:41] <cosimone> i see.  i understand your sentiment, but it's also true that, if you'd like this to be included in debian (or any other system) it's important to provide a detailed description of the problem

[04:33:42] <SpeakerToMeat> Question, is there any way to ensure that every time a new kernel is installed (an update) the corresponding linux-headers package is installed too?

[04:44:23] <jmcnaught> SpeakerToMeat: which headers package do you have installed?  Just like with the linux-image-amd64 meta-package that always depends on the newest kernel package, there is a linux-headers-amd64 meta-package that always depends on the newest headers.
[04:44:40] <jmcnaught> ,i linux-headers-amd64
[04:44:43] <judd> Package linux-headers-amd64 (kernel, optional) in bullseye/amd64: Header files for Linux amd64 configuration (meta-package). Version: 5.10.84-1; Size: 1.1k; Installed: 10k; Homepage: https://www.kernel.org/
[04:44:57] <jmcnaught> SpeakerToMeat: adjust for your architecture if not amd64 of course

[10:37:01] <EugenMayer> hello. trying to understand why unattended upgrades are not working as intended. Found out that https://gist.github.com/EugenMayer/7411b7acf9d67e010ed56403ac097c93 which is in the stock config (just uncommented) does not select anything, it is not working as intended. While https://gist.github.com/EugenMayer/b4af5ffbea678309de7b5d384cac6138 is
[10:37:01] <EugenMayer> working - did i get it wrong that the former should be rather more lose, since it would move with every distribution-upgrade automatically?

[12:09:22] <jelly> used to be a 3 moth schedule before the team was reduced from 4 to 3 to 2 people
[12:09:24] <EugenMayer> i understand the potential risks of unattended upgrades - but i also understand the gap between updates being available and me applying them (manually) on each server in the fleet. And when judging, i look at both of those facts, not just the former one. How do you people do that?
[12:09:50] *** Joins: i0e (~is0ke3@user/is0ke3)
[12:10:01] <EugenMayer>  jelly so security updates every 3 months? (or more)
[12:10:04] <jelly> yes
[12:11:04] <jelly> only about 2% of the machines and services are public facing
[12:12:13] <EugenMayer> Well i understand how you judge on your situation (2% is a low number). But beside that zero-trust is a real thing and you should care about intern-driven attacks as much as from the outside (you most probably valued that all in) - i find it very odd to see that strategy as 'the only one, stay the hell away from unattend upgrades'
[12:12:22] <jelly> and we're subscribed to DSA to see if there's anything actually relevant
[12:13:40] <EugenMayer> i'am honest, i know you are deeply involved and hugely knowledgeable in debian - so for all 'others' (or let's just take me), where i have 1% of your involvement and knowledge in debians ecosystem (running debian for 25 years know though, not an outsider either) - i would really ask myself which default is better. Start a box and forget about it.
[12:13:40] <EugenMayer> Or run unattended upgrades
[12:13:47] <jelly> it's not odd, I just know how crappy unattended-upgrades can be.
[12:14:10] <EugenMayer> well i do this for 20 yearss now
[12:14:42] <EugenMayer> (unattended-upgrades) and i would say, the amount of issues, maybe 10 times over all, compared to what it potentially secured me from - i take it every single day
[12:15:29] <EugenMayer> i understand, upgrading a server 1 by 1 is the better way - caring, checking, validting. Not arguing. But you got to do this, not talk about this. You should have the time, again and again. Over years. For every box.
[12:15:37] <jelly> I don't want to wake up to "all postgresql servers in cluster patched and decided to reboot at the same time"
[12:15:50] <EugenMayer> I never run applications directly on debian.
[12:16:12] <EugenMayer> Those boxes are mainly empty hosts for either a k8s oder docker engine.

[12:16:18] <jelly> maybe that's why you don't have to care as much

[12:17:33] <Khepra> one major problem of unattended upgrades is that it's incomplete and that's not obvious to typical user of it
[12:18:01] <Khepra> the "upgrades" part is incomplete. it's partial.
[12:18:06] <EugenMayer> Khepra it is not perfect - no doubt. Neither are we all forgetting to upgrade the servers for weeks or months. I weight those things
[12:18:16] *** Joins: i0e (~is0ke3@user/is0ke3)
[12:18:18] <jelly> EugenMayer, how do you schedule reboots and care about not killing more than half-1 of k8s masters?
[12:18:58] <EugenMayer> jelly i do not run auto-upgrades. For kernel upgrades i check for the reboot flag and start the nodes manually - so that one i care for (so the damn fleet does not restart at once)
[12:19:10] <EugenMayer> sorry s/auto-upgrades/auto-reboots
[12:19:39] <jelly> honestly, that's not much less work than running dist-upgrade and then checking for reboot
[12:19:50] <Khepra> what about library upgrades?
[12:20:37] <Khepra> if it were up to me, I'd completely ban unattended upgrades from the debian ecosystem. it facilitates the Lazy, it facilitates the Insecure through inaction and lack of proper care. https://www.zdnet.com/article/linux-malware-attacks-are-on-the-rise-and-businesses-arent-ready-for-it/
[12:20:49] <EugenMayer> Khepra that is the point, i keep the debian boxes slim. I do not run apps on it, which are not system-critical like whatever mdadm, monti and alikes. Anything else is in containers
[12:20:56] <jelly> EugenMayer, if all the actual software is running in containers/pods, then upgrading just the platform OS does not really patch much of anything
[12:21:24] <Khepra> in the coming years, that problem will just solve itself as more and more linux boxes gets compromised with all fallout: monetary and criminal responsibility

[12:23:39] <Khepra> jelly: openssh is one giant RCE engine. it's is, I'd say, sole purpose to facilitate RCE :) albeit in an authorized and secure fashion :)))
[12:24:06] <jelly> Khepra, it's not E
[12:24:10] <cosimone> tfw my bug about fwupd being pulled in still hasn't been replied to :(
[12:24:17] <Khepra> jelly: every time you hit enter over ssh it's an E
[12:24:47] <Khepra> so the problem is only when that E becomes unwanted, unintended, unauthorized through other vectors.
[12:25:02] <iateadonut> (if off-topic, sorry; but i'm sure if anyone knows, it'd be #debian).  is there a site/forum or whatever where people review their job interview assessments?
[12:25:22] <jelly> oh okay, it is RCE

[12:25:55] <Khepra> yeah, exec, not exploit.
[12:27:24] *** Joins: i0e (~is0ke3@user/is0ke3)
[12:27:27] <jelly> EugenMayer, so if you're using a subset of unattended-upgrades features on debian systems with a very limited set of packages, sure, I see how it can work for you
[12:27:46] <EugenMayer> jelly that is what i do, yeah.
[12:27:55] <Khepra> EugenMayer: because the two are closely related. being incomplete, it doesn't do the job the user expects it does. it facilitates an atmosphere of not caring, so the admin does't know when something is vulnerable and unpatched and needs action beyond waiting for the mintainer to wake up
[12:28:01] <jelly> however we're running actual services on debian :-)
[12:28:07] <jelly> not just docket
[12:28:39] <jelly> docker* and I suspect you don't restart docker engine automatically, either
[12:29:25] <EugenMayer> Khepra i understand. But you cannot staff up to maintain all the servers you have one by one. That is an insane amount of issues. To be honest, we should not take it religous. If you spend + 500k for people to upgrade servers manually/year and weight it agains 1 or 2 issues where unattended-upgrades went bananas, you might end up spending way too
[12:29:25] <EugenMayer> much money
[12:29:42] <EugenMayer> jelly they do not restart it automagically (usually)
[12:29:46] <Khepra> EugenMayer: I can maintain thousands of servers easily myself
[12:29:59] <EugenMayer> Khepra no you cannot without automation.
[12:30:18] <Khepra> but of course. that's what I mean. and why aren't you using automation?
[12:30:18] <jelly> automation is key
[12:30:54] <EugenMayer> You mean chef and alikes? Of course i use that. I use chef, terraform, iaas self hosted openstack and k8s for other automations.
[12:31:06] <Khepra> then where's the problem?
[12:31:09] <EugenMayer> Who told you i do not. Neither of this tasks will simply solve upgrades ever.
[12:31:17] <Khepra> why not?
[12:32:28] <EugenMayer> Would love to continue to discuss it, but i'am heaving a meeting in 2 minutes and do not want to be rude letting you hanging here just unsere. I have to go (understanding that this is a rather odd timing considering you just asked something, which cannot be answered in just 1 sentence though)
[12:32:53] <jelly> you're already late!  Unless the meeting starts at :05
[12:32:58] <Khepra> you get an alert from "canary" servers running something like apticron, that package X, Y and Z need upgrade. you instruct your automation to fire up a test server, run upgrdes, run (unit) tests, verify and then apply the same taks (could be single ansible playbook, for exmple, or saltstack task) to all the other servers in that class
[12:34:13] <EugenMayer> jelly you got me!
[12:34:35] <Khepra> the task also restarts services that need to be restarted, or whole servers if it's the kernel, and orchestrates the upgrades in waves through failover or LB pairs, so your production isn't affected.
[12:34:56] <jelly> keeping "test" servers consistent with actual prod servers running the real thing is left as an exercise for the reader

[12:35:40] <Khepra> yes but there's no zero risk scenarios. sometimes you risk it and see where it falls out. of course, you have zfs snapshots for easy reverting if something goes terribly wrong :))
[12:36:40] <Khepra> the (unit) test coverage I have, for example, is good enough. I so far never needed to ZFS rollback botched upgrades. any botched upgrades I had were kernel or initramfs misalignment that's solved in different ways. also, my /boots aren't zfs.

[15:40:10] <Khepra> that's very much specific to those paks. which one you choose, it's your decision.
[15:40:15] <jelly> pick one
[15:40:41] <Khepra> I'd WAG and say 1) is perhaps more stable than 2) which might change randomly, abruptly, and burn the whole computer and house, while at it.
[15:40:42] <cadmio> from this command "flatpak install --user org.gnome.Sdk"

[19:08:33] <randall> cadmio: If you install something with --no-install-recommends, this usually means that you can still use some parts of it, but it's definitely less useful. I guess this applies to your situation.
[19:08:36] <Khepra> cadmio: which DM you're using?
[19:09:15] <Khepra> cadmio: typically, unless you installed some DIY WM setup, the DM+systemd_logind should set up everything and you shouldn't need to resort to manual dbus tricks
