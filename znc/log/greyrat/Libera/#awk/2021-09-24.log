[17:53:05] <hseg> generating an ffmpeg script via awk, have pairs of start-timestamp, end-timestamp values in hh:mm:ss, and want to convert them to decimal (so I can then eg get segments from start/to end)
[17:53:08] <hseg> ideas?
[17:53:34] <yeti> convert to seconds
[17:54:48] <hseg> y, how do I convert a field in hh:mm:ss format to seconds?
[17:54:56] <hseg> would need to parse+eval, ig
[17:58:33] <emanuele6> hseg: why?
[17:58:40] <hseg> ok, so ig ensure all timestamps are indeed hh:mm:ss, then just match + convert
[17:58:48] <hseg> why what? why convert?
[17:58:58] <emanuele6> no, why eval?
[17:59:06] <emanuele6> function ts_to_sec(ts, _a) { split(ts,_a,/:/); return _a[1]*60*60+_a[2]*60+_a[3] }

[17:59:37] <hseg> didn't mean eval the function, just evaluate in general
[17:59:39] <shbot> emanuele6: 4230
[17:59:46] <hseg> ty!
[18:00:37] <hseg> what's _a there?
[18:00:59] <emanuele6> hseg: it's a convention to have pseudo-local variables
[18:01:02] <emanuele6> https://riptutorial.com/awk/example/10722/local-variables
[18:01:21] <hseg> awk doesn't have lexical scoping?
[18:01:26] <nmz__> nope
[18:01:28] <nmz__> all global
[18:01:46] <nmz__> its an old language
[18:02:17] <hseg> damn. also, ig you can pass less args than declared, and they carry over their old/uninitialized values?
[18:03:03] <emanuele6> arguments are not global
[18:03:03] <nmz__> its not bad, just make a function if you want locals and have a naming convention identifying them (like lowercase is local uppercase is global)
[18:03:14] <emanuele6> so this workaround works pretty well
[18:03:24] <nmz__> function arguments are the only way to get locals
[18:03:51] <hseg> sure, at least awk has named args unlike bash
[18:03:57] <nmz__> "          The scope rules for variables in functions are a botch; the
[18:03:58] <nmz__>           syntax is worse.
[18:04:00] <nmz__> "
[18:04:03] <hseg> lol
[18:04:09] <nmz__> that is from the man page in BUGS section
[18:04:32] <nmz__> from original-awk
[18:04:41] <hseg> asked re passing less args since I noticed your test of `ts_to_sec` only passed one arg but declared two
[18:04:48] <hseg> was guessing at the semantics
[18:04:58] <nmz__> quite frankly I don't want named args
[18:05:05] <nmz__> in shell
[18:06:23] <hseg> *shrug* dunno, perhaps i'm spoiled
[18:07:26] <yeti> I dont want to write more than a screen full of shell code, so I dont care how broken their design is
[18:07:48] <nmz__> a shell function should mimic the behavior of a command, this is why named arguments don't make sense
[18:08:03] <yeti> bs
[18:08:27] <nmz__> :)
[18:08:34] <yeti> function x(input,optiion)    would not make calling that function different from a command
[18:09:13] <nmz__> you can make a wrapper if you want
[18:09:15] <yeti> it just would make its definition more readable

[18:10:20] <nmz__> don't see what the big deal is
[18:10:54] <yeti> readability
[18:10:56] <hseg> k, wasn't really making a Statement
[18:11:17] <yeti> $option sure is nicer tnan $7
[18:11:40] <nmz__> if you want option you can set option=$7
[18:11:59] <emanuele6> nmz__: in (bourne) shell that would be global

[21:17:03] <Nintendo> How do I break a loop from within a switch within that loop?
[21:17:16] <Nintendo> AWK has no goto or “break 2”.

[21:22:12] <nmz__> do awk switches behave like C?
[21:23:39] <nmz__> oh, switch is a gawk only
[21:23:53] <nmz__> dont use it Nintendo

[21:35:43] <Nintendo> Ahh, you're right.  Thanks.
[21:36:56] <nmz__> Nintendo: you could always just force it, b=1 for (;b||expr;) switch(){case "stop": b=0;break}
[21:37:27] <nmz__> or you know, set the variable in expr to whatever is false
[21:37:33] <nmz__> or you can put it in a function and return
[21:38:02] <nmz__> or you can use an array
[21:38:29] <Nintendo> Nah, I dropped the switch statement altogether.
[21:38:29] <nmz__> if an array is possible
[21:38:47] <Nintendo> I have no qualms with if/else.
[21:39:34] <nmz__> lookup tables https://tpaste.us/EMnJ
[21:39:45] <Nintendo> But I cannot say the same for gawk-specific features, especially for flawed ones like switch.
[21:40:12] <Nintendo> Hey, that looks like a job for nkf ;)
[21:40:34] <Nintendo> (Not really.)
[21:40:44] <nmz__> I don't think awk needs a switch, awk is already a giant switch statement
[21:40:59] <nmz__> pattern {action} <- that's a switch to me
[21:41:50] <nmz__> what's nkf?
[21:43:47] <wwallace> Thank  you all 
[21:43:59] <wwallace> thank you Patsie geirha user51
[21:44:47] <Nintendo> It's a handy tool for converting character encodings in various ways with strong support for Japanese:  https://osdn.net/projects/nkf/
[21:45:46] <nmz__> converting character encodings? I usually use recode for that
[21:45:47] <Nintendo> It might also be the fastest way to decode percent-escaped URL strings on the command line.
[21:46:39] <Nintendo> Interesting.  I've only used nkf and iconv.
[21:46:55] <nmz__> "recode html.." will convert most html
[21:47:07] <Nintendo> It seems that recode is a front-end for libiconv.
[21:47:14] <nmz__> hehe
[21:47:49] <nmz__> TIL about that too
[21:48:24] <nmz__> I've stopped converting, just use pup text{} --plain
