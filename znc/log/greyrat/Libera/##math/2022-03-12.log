[06:29:52] <Batzy> yeah but isn't SIDH weak?

[06:30:02] <Batzy> isn't SIDH the DHSP one?
[06:30:11] <Batzy> i thought it was called CSIDH
[06:30:17] <Galois> ok, looks like you need to be unconfused
[06:30:22] <Batzy> yes
[06:30:35] <Galois> SIDH is my thing. SIDH is strong, but has an active attack. This is not new by the way. ALL lattice systems have active attacks.
[06:30:55] <Batzy> just to clear it up, I am definitely thinking of CSIDH with DHSP right?
[06:30:59] <Galois> there's a standard way to prevent active attacks. It's called Fujisaki-Okamoto. SIKE is SIDH+FujisakiOkamoto
[06:31:12] <Galois> ALL lattice systems, including the NIST candidates, are the same way

[06:31:17] <Galois> they're LWE+FujisakiOkamoto
[06:31:18] <Batzy> ok let me see
[06:31:19] <Galois> or LWR+FO
[06:31:21] <Galois> or whatever
[06:31:49] <Galois> the "weakness" in SIDH isn't out of place here. If you think SIDH is weak then you think all the candidates are weak.
[06:31:57] <Batzy> Galois ill read about it to sound like less of a moron, but i think i heard that learning with errors is a potential idea for an attack?
[06:32:15] <Galois> LWE is a problem, like RSA, not an attack
[06:32:28] <Batzy> oh wait
[06:32:33] <Batzy> ok ok
[06:32:37] <Galois> CSIDH is SOMETHING ELSE
[06:32:43] <Batzy> yes that's the dhsp one
[06:32:47] <Galois> it's confusingly named similar to SIDH, but it's something else
[06:32:57] <Batzy> ok ok thanks
[06:33:09] <Batzy> so besides the 20 lines of code, what do you think is an advantage of isogenies?
[06:33:15] <Batzy> (not discounting the 20 lines of code thing btw)
[06:33:16] <Galois> CSIDH really is weak. Peikert's C-Sieves work breaks the original parameters.
[06:33:30] <Galois> you need parameters ten times larger for proper security.
[06:33:46] <Batzy> yes there is a subexponential attack on it iirc
[06:33:46] <Galois> this invalidates almost all of the originally claimed advantages of CSIDH
[06:34:25] <Galois> the most directly measurable advantage of isogenies is that the keys are small. SIDH has 190 byte public keys. Sometimes this matters.
[06:34:27] <Batzy> yes i heard that too

[06:34:52] <Galois> SIKE has 197 byte public keys. This is by far the smallest of any NIST candidate.
[06:35:02] <Batzy> ah ok
[06:35:10] <Galois> ok, if you don't care about small keys, then there's one more thing that might matter.
[06:35:12] <Batzy> small code, small public key, very nice
[06:35:30] <Galois> isogenies are a mathematically correct encryption scheme.
[06:35:48] <Galois> By this I mean, if you decrypt an encrypted message, you will get back exactly the original message text
[06:36:01] <Galois> surprisingly, this simple property does not actually hold for any of the lattice schemes
[06:36:05] <Batzy> https://lukas-prokop.at/articles/2020-06-19-fo-transform does this have your approval for FujisakiOkamoto btw
[06:36:10] <Galois> nor for ClassicMcEliece
[06:36:24] <Batzy> Galois i didnt know that
[06:36:32] <Galois> you should really just read the Fujisaki Okamoto paper directly
[06:36:37] <Batzy> ok
[06:36:43] <Galois> citation fo13 in that page
[06:37:13] <Galois> the point is, lattice schemes work by introducing error, and then using the private key to erase the error
[06:37:40] <Galois> when you're doing this, there is actually a small chance that the error ends up being uncorrectable
[06:37:56] <Batzy> any implications for speed as well?
[06:37:58] <Galois> the key word to look for is "decryption failure"
[06:38:10] <Galois> well, lattices are (much) faster than isogenies, for sure
[06:38:11] <Batzy> and what is a "small chance" here?
[06:38:23] <Galois> like 2^-150 or thereabouts, depends on the scheme and the parameter set
[06:38:30] <Batzy> i mean over the course of the standard you're going to have lots of decryptions so
[06:38:36] <Batzy> ok
[06:39:02] <Batzy> that sounds negligible though
[06:39:06] <MsPoop> haha
[06:39:10] <Galois> yes, it certainly is negligible
[06:39:29] <Batzy> what's the point then, isogenies is just moral then?
[06:39:40] <Galois> I'm not saying it's going to happen. The entire current bitcoin network will take 100000 times the current age of the universe to reach 2^150 hashes
[06:39:49] <Batzy> yes
[06:39:54] <Galois> there's a moral point and a practical point
[06:39:59] <Batzy> but that's for high probability
[06:40:07] <Batzy> so you might have a point
[06:40:30] <Galois> the moral point is just that: it seems unsatisfying to use a scheme that's not perfectly correct
[06:40:57] <Galois> the practical point is that in some cases an adversary can force behavior that increases the probability of decryption error to the point where it is meaningful and exploitable, for example in a side-channel attack
[06:41:53] <Batzy> you've said this to NIST folks surely?
[06:41:56] <Batzy> what was the response?

[07:00:04] <Batzy> for a place trying to pick out a new crypto standard...?
[07:00:17] <Galois> that's like telling your younger brother "I'll let you win when you're older than me"
[07:00:24] <Batzy> yeah
[07:00:53] <Batzy> it really is bizarre, because they have nothing but good things to say outside of that

[07:00:59] <Batzy> whatever
[07:01:25] <Batzy> i really like this "strong candidate for future standardization"
[07:01:43] <Batzy> if you pick a standard, it already is going to take awhile to push it to everything
[07:01:52] <Galois> cryptographers will take a fast insecure algorithm over a slow secure algorithm any day
[07:02:31] <Galois> the only way to make actual progress is to come up with something both faster and more secure. Unfortunately SIKE is not faster, so it may be doomed for that reason alone. But we keep trying.
[07:02:39] <Batzy> if you're being completely honest how worried are you really about the security of the finalists?
[07:02:57] <Batzy> is that your current focus btw? making SIKE faster?
[07:03:02] <Galois> part of it
[07:03:08] <Batzy> ah so you are looking at other things
[07:03:16] <Galois> I think all the finalists are based on a similar problem, taking errors in a lattice and correcting them somehow
[07:03:23] <Batzy> yes
[07:03:34] <Batzy> there may be 1 exception?
[07:03:36] <Batzy> let me look it up
[07:03:41] <Galois> with the lattice schemes it's exactly that, and with classicmceliece it's still errors in a lattice, they're just coding errors instead of distance errors
[07:03:51] <Galois> I am talking about the four encryption scheme finalists
[07:04:16] <Batzy> oh ok
[07:04:18] <Galois> there is one signature scheme not based on lattices (rainbow), but that one got broken last week
[07:04:28] <Batzy> oh wow
[07:04:49] <Galois> beyond that, all the finalists are lattices or codes, which to me are almost the same thing, correcting an error
[07:05:15] <Galois> and the thing is, we really don't understand how secure this idea is.

[07:06:52] <Batzy> i've heard that
[07:07:07] <Galois> but they sort of don't mention that structured lattices are working only in a very restricted type of lattice
[07:07:24] <Galois> and for performance reasons they've shaved the parameters down to almost the bare minimum
[07:07:27] <Batzy> structured... are you referencing the periodic nature?
[07:07:27] *** Joins: millido (~millido@84.210.150.128)
[07:07:47] <Galois> ok, time for math. A lattice has a basis. This basis is a matrix.
[07:07:54] <Batzy> yes
[07:08:00] <Galois> matrices are huge. They grow as O(n^2) where n is the dimension
[07:08:05] <Batzy> yes
[07:08:18] <Galois> if you don't impose any periodic structure then you get huge keys, like frodokem with 50-500kB
[07:08:19] <Batzy> oh nooo
[07:08:31] <Galois> or classicmceliece with 1MB+
[07:08:34] <Batzy> i think i might see where you're going, but continue
[07:08:41] <Batzy> ok sure
[07:08:55] <Galois> so the idea of structured lattices is, let's make the rows or columns or whatever periodic, so that the amount of data in there is only O(n) instead of O(n^2)
[07:09:22] <Batzy> yeah
[07:09:27] <Galois> that's fine, the scheme still works, and it does reduce the key size quite a bit and increase performance since you can use implementation tricks to avoid a full matrix multiplication
[07:09:33] <Batzy> well i was at least told the lattice was periodic
[07:09:48] <Batzy> i asked myself about it
[07:09:51] <Galois> but ... now the lattices are drawn from a very special case
[07:10:00] <Galois> does this affect security? who knows
[07:10:07] <Batzy> hm
[07:10:15] <tmyklebu> correcting errors is known to be hard---isn't LDPC decoding done by solving shortest vector problems?
[07:10:23] <Batzy> if someone sat you down to break lattices is that what you'd look at?
[07:10:38] <Galois> correcting errors in general is known to be hard, but you can construct special cases where it's easy
[07:10:39] <Batzy> tmyklebu: i think so!
[07:10:41] <Batzy> for the second part
[07:10:48] <Galois> the worry is that structured lattices would be such a special case
[07:11:17] <Galois> there's lots of historical instances where someone chose a special case of parameters for performance reasons and that special case turned out to be broken
[07:11:26] <Galois> (not in lattices, but in other stuff)
[07:11:30] <Batzy> Galois: like RSA being broken by period-finding?
[07:12:05] <Galois> no, it would be more like, I dunno, using small decryption exponents in RSA
[07:12:11] <Galois> (that special case is faster, but it was broken)
[07:12:12] <Batzy> oh haha
[07:12:37] <Galois> small doesn't mean obviously broken stuff like d=3, but I mean d = O(n^(1/4)) or something which is meaningfully faster and not obviously broken
[07:12:42] <Galois> (but is actually broken)
[07:13:01] <Batzy> Galois: would you be comfortable saying "it's feasible that knowing something about the periodicity of a lattice would make it easier to break"
[07:13:31] <Galois> I think we don't know, and the history of structured lattices only goes back 12 years or so, not even older than isogeny cryptography
[07:13:47] <Batzy> yes so..feasible
[07:13:49] <Batzy> at least right now
[07:14:01] <Galois> the right word is "it's possible"
[07:14:04] <Galois> we don't know
[07:14:04] <Batzy> ok
[07:14:10] <Batzy> well it's sort of a religious belief
[07:14:14] <Batzy> that it's fine :)
[07:14:25] <Galois> it remains religious until the break is discovered and published

[09:34:23] <empioneer[m]> I think normal cameras are designed to focus on objects that create sharp boundaries against it background. The camera continues to adjust its focal length until it finds that lines and edges in the scene become the sharpest possible.

[14:33:44] <ProfSimm> river: let's consider a pragmatic example, we have a space operator that's treated as "apply' chain in haskell  a b c  is a(b(c))

[14:34:02] *** climax is now known as gentooclimax
[14:34:21] <ProfSimm> river: you also have optional labels in lists:    (1 2 3 g: 4 5 6)

[14:34:55] *** Joins: rg (~r-g@gateway/tor-sasl/r-g)
[14:34:56] <ProfSimm> river: because the label can be any expression like   (1 2 3 (oepjgpojgpojerpg opej gpoej rpgojpoer g): 4 5 6)
[14:36:23] <river> parsing is done in two stages: tokenization, building an AST
[14:36:30] <ProfSimm> river: sure
[14:36:36] *** Quits: i0e (~is0ke3@user/is0ke3) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[14:36:52] <river> imo a well designed syntax is one where you can tell what something is from the token language
[14:36:56] <ProfSimm> river: point was that the label can be N tokens
[14:37:00] <ProfSimm> Not just 1
[14:37:08] <river> it shouldn't need to be figured out from the AST, or even worse from semantic analysis
[14:37:36] <ProfSimm> river: technically it can all be figured out from the tokens in all cases, or you have no language
[14:37:56] <river> something I meant to say but forgot is that tokenization should be a regular language

[14:38:20] <river> and building the AST can be done with something higher, e.g. something that can match brackets like a CFG, PEG, LL(1)
[14:38:41] <river> but in practice languages just using code to implement parsers, and completely ignore theory and statification like this

[14:45:57] <ProfSimm> river: I have a rule - if it's simple for my brain to parse, then it's simple.
[14:46:17] <river> I believe that simplicity is actually the key value you get from sticking to a mathematically reasonable reference point
[14:46:22] <river> reasonable/natural
[14:46:26] *** Joins: i0e (~is0ke3@user/is0ke3)
[14:46:48] <river> if you want to stick some crazy thing you need a turing machine to do, into the syntax of a language - IMO, you're doing a bad thing
[14:47:21] <river> this is not to say you cannot do complex stuff at a higher level *after* parsing, like macros that respect scope or type systems
[14:47:30] <ProfSimm> river: math is not absolute though. it's something we made up
[14:47:55] <ProfSimm> river: in particular, parsers can be defined in many ways that are mathematically consistent
[14:48:31] <river> yes you are right
[14:48:52] <river> but when i say natural
[14:49:00] *** Joins: unknow (~i.am@user/marlboro)
[14:49:11] <river> i'm referring to this, like regular languages just happen to be defined in a whole bunch of different ways
[14:49:41] <ProfSimm> river: let's take this example of a closure in an array:      [a, v, c, d, e, f, g, .... -> a, b, c, d, e, f, g, i] before the arrow, the letter looks like list items. Afte the arrow, they are arguments. Does that rub you the wrong way
[14:49:56] <river> that isn't a problem
[14:50:10] <ProfSimm> OK but you need to see the arrow to interpret infinite tokens before it
[14:50:27] <river> as tokens you just have  SQUARE_OPEN_BRACKET SYMBOL('a') COMMA ..... ARROW SYMBOL('a') COMMA
[14:50:36] <ProfSimm> Sure
[14:50:44] <river> so this can be tokenized with a regular language
[14:52:25] <ProfSimm> river: I forgot which part of regex was not regular
[14:52:29] <ProfSimm> PCRE regex for ex.
[14:53:30] <river> yes there are extended versions of regex, and they no longer have all the mathematical theory applicable
[14:53:38] <river> basic regex does not make use of the theory though
[14:53:46] <ProfSimm> river: you're a strong believer of type systems am I right
[14:53:52] <river> regex is closed under things like compliment, union, intersection.. you have no operators for these in normal regex
[14:54:05] <river> I suppose I do believe in type systems
[14:54:16] <river> I would rather use typescript than javascript
[14:54:23] <ProfSimm> Well I would too
[14:54:44] <ProfSimm> But I see it also as a flawed approach, because type assume everything is static.
[14:54:50] <ProfSimm> types*
[14:55:02] <ProfSimm> We need a type system that naturally integrates with runtime state
[14:55:16] <ProfSimm> I don't mean the usual ways of dependent typing
[14:55:20] <river> yes thats a valid point
[14:55:27] <river> types are inherently restrictive
[14:56:38] <ProfSimm> river: the problem is it's like a pendulum. You don't want the pendulum to swing way too hard to static then too hard to runtime. You need to oscillate a bit, and frequently. Basically I imagine it as multiple JIT stages, where at every stage we lock down mutable state as locally immutable (invariant) and check types under that assumption

[17:51:00] <pyzozord> hi, I'm thinking about powersets and I'm trying to figure out intution for why is the list of all combinations is equal to 2^n
[17:51:26] <pyzozord> so far I learned that it's 2 states (included or excluded) to the nth power where n is the length of the set
[17:51:38] <pyzozord> so it's 2 * 2 * ... * 2
[17:51:55] <pyzozord> but I don't really understand why it's multiplication not addition there
[17:52:08] <pyzozord> should it be "included or excluded PLUS included or excluded PLUS ..."?

[17:58:09] <pyzozord> Yes I see
[17:58:17] <pyzozord> I still don't quite get the intuition though
[17:58:24] <river> one way is to think about it as a binary string
[17:58:45] <river> you can describe a subset using bits, 0 for not in the subset, 1 for in the subset
[17:58:53] <pyzozord> it seems to me part of the intuition is that multiplication makes it grow exponentially, like a tree
[17:58:58] <river> if my set is {a,b,c} then 110 corresponds to {a,b}
[17:59:34] <river> another way to think about it is counting the functions from {1,2,3,..,n} -> {0,1}
[17:59:44] <river> the number of functions A -> B is |B|^|A|
[18:00:15] <pyzozord> || stands for what?

[20:00:19] <majest1c> Let us say that at t=0 I know that 10 people have a particular credit rating. Later, at t=1, I observe a change in credit ratings for these 10 people. Since I observed this, I know the probabilties of going from one rating to the another over this time period. I summarize this in a stochastic/markov matrix called P.
[20:00:27] <majest1c> Now I want to predict the credit rating transitions in the future, assuming this is a first order markov process. So the matrix which covers transitions from t=0 to t=1 I denote as P(t=0). What if I want to predict the transitions over the t=2 to t=3 period? I think that in theory I would now perform the matrix multiplication P(t=2) = P(t=0) x
[20:00:27] <majest1c> P(t=0) x P(t=0).
[20:00:35] <majest1c> However, let us say that historically I have observed the P(t=0) and P(t=1) matrix, would I then perform P(t=0) x P(t=1) to get the P(t=2) predicted matrix?

[21:22:11] <isekaijin> What?
[21:22:24] <isekaijin> When I took linear algebra, we talked about abstract vector spaces and linear maps right from the start.
[21:23:42] <NllPtr> really?
[21:23:47] <isekaijin> Yes.
[21:24:24] <NllPtr> oh you mean the course on linear algebra, my uni has 2 separate courses, MAT022 which has calculus and complement where in complement one sees basically linear algebra and then we have a course named Linear Algebra
[21:24:42] <NllPtr> on the course Linear Algebra you start from vector spaces, linear transformation define the matrix of al inear transformation and so on
[21:24:57] <NllPtr> on MAT022 you start with matrix multiplication and all that
[21:25:20] <NllPtr> then you see a little bit of vector spaces, but they never talk about linear transformation
[21:25:23] <NllPtr> i find that very very weird
[21:25:47] <NllPtr> because, from my understanding, linear algebra is in essense the study of linear transformation between finite dimensional vector spaces
[21:25:56] <isekaijin> Well, this MAT022 course probably only covers enough linear algebra for the notion of differentiability to make sense.
[21:25:58] <isekaijin> Right?
[21:26:13] <savask> NllPtr: I think matrices are easier to explain, you can always just draw a table with concrete numbers and that will be an example of a matrix, where an example of a linear map has to be more "abstract"
[21:26:14] <blackfield> we started with vector spaces too, but in any case what's the difference between matrices and linear transformations anyway :D
[21:26:34] <isekaijin> Mmm.
[21:26:48] <isekaijin> Things start to get sketchy when you consider infinite-dimensional vector spaces.
[21:27:38] <NllPtr> isekaijin: MAT022 doesn't get to vector calculus, so i don't see why they would need, most exam questions there are of the type what conditions do we need for the matrix to be invertible and calculate the inverse
[21:27:40] <isekaijin> What's the the matrix that represents the Fourier transform, as a linear endomorphism of the Schwartz space?
[21:28:04] <isekaijin> NllPtr: I'd say vector calculus is a more advanced topic than just multivariate calculus.
[21:28:16] <NllPtr> oh then it doesn't get to multivariable calculus
[21:28:25] <NllPtr> i use them interchangably srroy
[21:29:21] <NllPtr> but when you phrase the question of a matrix being invertible as a linear transformation being invertible its obvious that you need it to be bijective, because it is a function in the end
[21:29:43] <NllPtr> and then of course you can consider the kernel of the lt and all that shit
[21:29:54] <NllPtr> i just find it weird the way they are teaching it tbh
[21:31:22] <blackfield> i suppose you're right, or could represent module homomorphisms too..

[22:09:47] <isekaijin> Maybe you can learn superficially some tricks that make it look like you understand.

[22:16:36] <isekaijin> And the reason why I don't want to study is that it's a huge bunch of abstract shit.
[22:17:53] <isekaijin> For calculus, the payoff was self-evident: pretty much every physical law I knew until then was formulated as a differential equation.

[22:26:39] <isekaijin> Yeah.
[22:27:36] <mornfall> i mean, why even attend?
[22:28:19] <mornfall> if you are way ahead of the class, i'm sure you can arrange something even for cases where attendance is normally compulsory
[22:28:30] <mornfall> which is probably a minority of the cases to begin with
[22:28:47] <isekaijin> As long as you don't bother others, why should they care if you don't pay attention?
[22:29:30] <somiaj> Personally as long as students are getting As and Bs on the assignments/quizzes, they should just keep doing what they are doing, they are meeting the learning goals
[22:29:38] <somiaj> (provided they aren't a disruption to class)
[22:29:49] <isekaijin> Just attend class and pay just enough attention to make sure you don't miss it when the instructor takes attendance.

[22:36:15] <isekaijin> It depends on the university's culture, I think. When I studied engineering, we had to attend at least 70% of all classes just to be able to take the final exam.
[22:36:28] <isekaijin> And the final exam is 40% of the final grade, so, basically, we have to attend class.

[22:41:03] <blues_no_clues[m> it is how u see students showing up to class eating a burrito

[22:44:50] <isekaijin> Anyhow, compulsory attendance seems to be a thing in classes where the material itself isn't hard enough to force students to attend.

[22:46:10] <blues_no_clues[m> when shit is boring but necesssary
[22:46:19] <blues_no_clues[m> but it is better to incentivise class participation
[22:46:24] <blues_no_clues[m> as compared to making attendance necessary
[22:46:47] <isekaijin> So your ideal classes would have no more than 5-10 students or what?
[22:46:58] <mornfall> yeah, in non-first-semester courses, i just balance the grading so that being in class pays off pretty well
[22:47:11] <mornfall> but if you don't want to, you are free to make up for it
