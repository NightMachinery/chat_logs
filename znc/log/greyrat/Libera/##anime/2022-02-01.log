[00:00:02] <MootPoot> linux moment
[00:00:32] <JesseDesu> fuck linux
[00:00:34] <Sapphirus> and 54% of Canadians want all restrictions to end, according to a recent AngusReid poll.
[00:00:40] <JesseDesu> why cant it be more like ipad
[00:00:40] <Bco1981> JesseDesu: any home router should be setup as a dhcp server. so you should be able to just set that linux to automatic (dhcp) and that should be it.
[00:00:43] <MootPoot> oh god
[00:00:45] <Sapphirus> Such a fringe minority, JT
[00:00:46] <MootPoot> I remember that 
[00:00:50] <MootPoot> AngusRied
[00:00:56] <KatrinValerie> Meow
[00:00:57] <MootPoot> used to get emails from them
[00:01:16] <KatrinValerie> am I a kawaii girl?

[00:05:42] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: I have changed my views on the lockdown
[00:05:48] <MootPoot> I want it to be even stronger
[00:06:01] <MootPoot> everyone, including the PM should all just be basement-dwelling NEETs like me
[00:06:26] <MootPoot> imagine if the entire country of canada turns into "I use arch btw"
[00:06:40] <Sapphirus> lmfao that'd be hilarious
[00:06:50] <MootPoot> "sorry, I use arch"
[00:07:33] <MootPoot> I had 220 grams of beef right now
[00:08:19] <Jigsy> My favorite month of the year is March. I use arch btw.
[00:08:33] <MootPoot> March of the Arch users
[00:08:59] <mixfix41> JesseDesu: try wpa_gui
[00:09:12] <MootPoot> speaking of
[00:09:22] <MootPoot> do we still send all our trash to china now
[00:09:25] <MootPoot> or SE asia
[00:09:33] <MootPoot> or does it just get landfilled now
[00:11:43] <mixfix41> JesseDesu: im unsure if you are doing wireless or ethernet but its your only unfamiliar its a lot easier and more powerful then a ipad is
[00:12:20] <mixfix41> well actually for programmer they know the kinks with apple 
[00:12:28] <mixfix41> its pretty slick what you can do
[00:12:43] *** Quits: tiotags (~tiotags@user/tiotags) (Quit: Leaving)
[00:16:09] <JesseDesu> mixfix it says could not get status from wpa_supplicant
[00:16:51] <mixfix41> thats for wifi
[00:16:56] <mixfix41> if you are doing that
[00:17:38] *** Joins: dgcampea-2 (~dgc@user/dgcampea)
[00:18:10] <JesseDesu> adapter and network are grayed out
[00:18:11] <mixfix41> you might have to use netctl wtih systemd
[00:18:42] <mixfix41> so something like sudo systemctl netctl start after configuring your wifi network in a configuration file
[00:19:10] <mixfix41> and ip link and helpful w/ systemd
[00:19:43] <JesseDesu> yea i'm gonna need a more step by step break down
[00:19:48] <JesseDesu> i'm giving it a rest
[00:19:57] <JesseDesu> i am tired
[00:20:05] <JesseDesu> i've been trying to solve this for 6 hours now
[00:20:15] *** Quits: dgcampea (~dgc@user/dgcampea) (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[00:21:10] <JesseDesu> can never assume i know what mixfix41 is talking about 
[00:21:45] <JesseDesu> i have a feeling if i just plug in an external network card this should all just
[00:21:46] <JesseDesu> WORK
[00:22:40] <mixfix41> just ethernet or wifi
[00:24:15] <JesseDesu> i want the wifi to work
[00:24:36] <mixfix41> systemd is a little different than the vanilla packages fyi
[00:24:46] <mixfix41> so if you try to ignore it its not gonna get you on
[00:25:12] <mixfix41> archwiki is your friend in this instance
[00:25:32] <mixfix41> and you should be in your rootfs where those configs are youll get there
[00:25:46] <JesseDesu> yup i dont know where this is going
[00:26:10] <JesseDesu> mixfix you are throwing a huge wrench in my gears
[00:26:21] <Bco1981> hmm lubuntu 20.04 LTS actually looks nice.
[00:26:38] <mixfix41> definitely netctl or networkmanager its just the distomaintainer has set their way on it if they have a different philosophy about maintaining it
[00:29:39] <Jigsy> I forgot to go to the store and buy ice cream...
[00:29:40] <Jigsy> Oh well.
[00:29:56] <mixfix41> tecmints says theres nmcli and nmtui tools try those
[00:32:29] <mixfix41> your says it doesnt have wpa_supplicant running you can start that in background , specify an interface , specify where your configuration is (if they didnt mess with this package) otherwise you gotta use systemd
[00:33:12] *** Quits: Cashlin (~hp@user/cashlin) (Remote host closed the connection)
[00:33:38] *** Joins: Cashlin (~hp@user/cashlin)
[00:35:42] <mixfix41> and they will bring your interface up
[00:36:01] <mixfix41> then just choose away to route your hostnames dynammically, or dnsmasq, manually, etc
[00:36:46] *** dgcampea-2 is now known as dgcampea
[00:37:31] <KatrinValerie> Do not manually edit stuff in a network-manager env
[00:37:32] <KatrinValerie> lol
[00:37:52] <KatrinValerie> Go through the proper channels, use the cli or gui tools
[00:39:05] <AmalLight> KatrinValerie some linux distribution doesn't have proper gui
[00:39:16] <AmalLight> for network i meant
[00:39:29] <KatrinValerie> AmalLight: which is why I recommended the cli as the first thing :D
[00:39:30] <mixfix41> yes i agree
[00:39:34] <KatrinValerie> command line interface
[00:39:41] <KatrinValerie> Meow
[00:39:42] <mixfix41> start the wpa_supplicant with systemctl
[00:39:50] <mixfix41> then get familiar with wpa_cli
[00:40:16] <KatrinValerie> Me I am lazy and just let the gnome network manager stuff handle things for me
[00:40:23] <mixfix41> add_network, set_network ssid "YOURSSID", set_network psk "wpa_passphrase", enable_network 0
[00:40:28] <mixfix41> save_config
[00:40:41] <KatrinValerie> back in the day I would use a python gui for wifi configuration
[00:40:46] <mixfix41> thats exactly how you use it after wpa_supplicant is running
[00:40:47] <KatrinValerie> but that was long before network manager
[00:41:16] <mixfix41> the painstaking thing is if the distromaintainer moves the configuration file to integrate it with systemd you might not have a configuration you can edit with wpa_cli
[00:41:23] <mixfix41> so thats why i say you should do it their way..
[00:42:09] <AmalLight> KatrinValerie yes , you are rightly wise . Meow
[00:42:11] <mixfix41> and their way may involve going into the directory where systemctl looks for your network info, which wpa_cli creates in those detail steps there
[00:42:27] <mixfix41> its all the same really just moves around
[00:42:29] <mixfix41> nothing bad
[00:43:08] <AmalLight> KatrinValerie wich is your operative system ?
[00:43:13] <mixfix41> and and ip link with systemctl its good to bring your interface down in up particuar with systemd cause its weirder
[00:43:17] <AmalLight> if i can ask this
[00:43:27] <Bco1981> lubuntu in virtualbox runs extremly well
[00:43:29] <KatrinValerie> AmalLight: nah, I have just been around for a while. I am using Debian as my daily. Windows as a Games Launcher for when Debian falls short.
[00:43:59] <mixfix41> sorry for the spelling on that last line im laying down 
[00:44:07] <KatrinValerie> Just use systemctl for everything
[00:44:11] <AmalLight> ok all right
[00:44:38] <KatrinValerie> I keep forgetting how things work though, because I only maintain my own desktop system at the moment.
[00:45:02] <AmalLight> mixfix41 XD  i can see you laying down on the floor
[00:45:28] <AmalLight> sorry but i was had this image on my mind
[00:45:43] <mixfix41> oh i forget youll want to use dhclient i use that on fedora
[00:45:53] <mixfix41> if your interface and things is ready
[00:46:03] <mixfix41> see here: https://www.linuxbabe.com/command-line/ubuntu-server-16-04-wifi-wpa-supplicant

[00:46:17] <mixfix41> probs thats how 
[00:46:47] <KatrinValerie> mixfix41: I keep forgetting what the firewall software I use is called
[00:46:54] <mixfix41> but youll want to know this entirely its excruciating coming back to your computer nad having trouble connecting
[00:47:49] <Jigsy> gufw?
[00:47:50] <mixfix41> dnsmasq++ because you figure out the whole thing and know what packages to purge because it conflict with dhcp
[00:47:53] <KatrinValerie> Oh right, it is called the uncomplicated firewall or ufw
[00:48:02] <Jigsy> gufw is great,
[00:48:04] <Jigsy> -,+.
[00:48:21] <KatrinValerie> Jigsy: it's a firewall, I configure that in the shell
[00:48:52] <mixfix41> iptables?
[00:49:03] <KatrinValerie> iptables is complicated
[00:49:06] <KatrinValerie> I want uncomplicated
[00:49:13] <KatrinValerie> So I installed the uncomplicated firewall
[00:49:15] <KatrinValerie> xD
[00:50:07] <Bco1981> get a gui for it
[00:50:40] <mixfix41> no guis when it comes to connecting i never use those
[00:50:46] <KatrinValerie> Bco1981: I refuse, the cli is uncomplicated
[00:50:58] <KatrinValerie> for ufw
[00:51:15] <KatrinValerie> You just make rules and it works
[00:51:15] <ButterNoodle> wut
[00:51:15] <mixfix41> he has to rely on dhclient, wpa supplicant service , and  iwconfig maybe?
[00:51:19] <ButterNoodle> iptables
[00:51:20] <ButterNoodle> ez
[00:51:42] <KatrinValerie> ButterNoodle: for iptables I have to read the man page, for ufw I can set things up from just the help messages
[00:51:49] <ButterNoodle> ?
[00:51:52] <KatrinValerie> I am lazy, iptables requires too much work
[00:52:01] <ButterNoodle> run windows
[00:52:10] <KatrinValerie> Windows does not work and constantly breaks
[00:52:16] <ButterNoodle> it will configure the best firewall options for you
[00:52:19] <KatrinValerie> I am happy with my Debian
[00:52:31] <AmalLight> Jigsy gufw was been my only friend for more time XD
[00:52:33] <KatrinValerie> ButterNoodle: you are being payed by redmond
[00:52:39] <ButterNoodle> nope
[00:52:48] <ButterNoodle> light trolling.. bc iptables ez
[00:52:57] <KatrinValerie> ebtables
[00:53:02] <ButterNoodle> ipchains if u want real ez
[00:53:05] <ButterNoodle> lol

[00:53:45] <ButterNoodle> it works
[00:53:49] <AmalLight> i love iptables T__T
[00:53:54] <ButterNoodle> #metoo
[00:54:06] <ButterNoodle> ebtables.. have u used that KatrinValerie?
[00:54:29] *** Bco1981_3 is now known as Bco1981_2
[00:54:44] <ButterNoodle> It's been a few years.. I use it to do transparent firewalling before that was a thing
[00:55:01] <ButterNoodle> ~2005
[00:55:34] <KatrinValerie> ButterNoodle: I think I have, don't remember if it was around 2003 or 2006
[00:55:35] <AmalLight> but why in anime channel we are speaking about firewall ?
[00:55:41] <AmalLight> XD
[00:55:44] <ButterNoodle> AmalLight: fine
[00:55:51] <ButterNoodle> tell me ur favorite hentai
[00:55:55] <AmalLight> ButterNoodle sorry i am joking
[00:56:03] <KatrinValerie> AmalLight: it's a tech channel, go to ##programming to talk about anime
[00:56:05] <AmalLight> i can't stay serious
[00:56:12] <KatrinValerie> jk
[00:56:23] <AmalLight> KatrinValerie TOP

[00:57:39] <KatrinValerie> There will be no need for those
[00:58:26] <AmalLight> ButterNoodle i never seen one of hentai
[00:58:28] <AmalLight> sorry
[00:58:36] <KatrinValerie> A post-capitalist society does not need such trifle
[00:58:46] <AmalLight> i am watching only movie
[00:58:52] <KatrinValerie> Under my rule we shalt overcome the opression of the working class
[00:59:05] <Bco1981_2> hm... lubuntu looked nice, until i installed btop and you can't make it look right no matter what console font you chose.
[00:59:15] <AmalLight> KatrinValerie XD
[00:59:38] <AmalLight> KatrinValerie they will find way to manipulate you
[01:00:10] <KatrinValerie> Tbh, I wouldn't want to have a position like that ever
[01:00:17] <KatrinValerie> I don't think presidents should exist
[01:00:32] <AmalLight> ButterNoodle my favourite anime is/are: naruto/code geass/devil may cry/death note
[01:00:47] <KatrinValerie> But idk if we can really manage to transform society that deeply.
[01:00:55] <AmalLight> hunter hunter is my top favorite anime to be honest
[01:01:12] <KatrinValerie> if it doesn't, capitalism is going to eat itself and will make earth uninhabitable :D
[01:01:46] <Urchin[emacs]> AmalLight: fairly normal grab-bag of battle shounen with a bit of edgy stuff thrown in
[01:02:01] <AmalLight> KatrinValerie yes mee too i think that
[01:02:27] <KatrinValerie> Still didn't get around to watching code geass
[01:02:31] <AmalLight> Urchin[emacs] hunter hunter ?
[01:02:34] <AmalLight> :(
[01:02:40] <Urchin[emacs]> AmalLight: all of it
[01:02:48] <AmalLight> Urchin[emacs] ahah
[01:03:11] <KatrinValerie> Well, there are certainly anime of higher artistic value, but what matters is that they entertain, right?
[01:03:21] <mixfix41> i watch kantai collection this morning it was refreshing 8-)
[01:03:37] <AmalLight> Urchin[emacs] i don't go to search anime in the secret places . Usually i am watching what the tv share
[01:03:41] <KatrinValerie> well okay trash anime exists
[01:04:12] <AmalLight> T__T
[01:04:27] <KatrinValerie> AmalLight: there are free and legal streaming platforms around, what's available depends on your country, but well geoblocking can be tricked.
[01:04:31] <AmalLight> i will say that you said me to my mother :(  ( JOKE )
[01:04:41] <KatrinValerie> And the not legal stuff is something we do not talk about.
[01:05:08] <KatrinValerie> I used to stream from Crunchyroll.com mostly
[01:05:50] <mixfix41> Bco1981_2: if it does things differently though like raspbian its really useful to learn even more older commands for example like using start with flags i never have to use that except on raspbian so i imagine it could be the same on lubuntu
[01:05:52] <AmalLight> don't you like code geass ?
[01:05:59] <KatrinValerie> oh boy, I miss the days when you could just grab an OVA off a supermarket shelf
[01:06:02] <mixfix41> startx*

[01:19:37] <KatrinValerie> Uh, idk how naruto has less of that xD
[01:19:45] <Bco1981> mixfix41: it's the Qterminal that messes it up. installed gnome-terminal and it looks fin in that.
[01:19:52] <AmalLight> i like hunter hunter because it is explain the training scene very well
[01:19:53] <KatrinValerie> just comparing to stuff you mentioned
[01:20:05] <AmalLight> also the explanation of nen is epic
[01:20:11] <KatrinValerie> AmalLight: if you like training arcs in anime, you should watch dragonball
[01:20:22] <AmalLight> KatrinValerie don't tuch my Naruto
[01:20:36] <AmalLight> XD
[01:20:51] <KatrinValerie> Ey, I watched the whole thing up to shippuden
[01:20:52] <AmalLight> Katarushisu dragonball yes i liked when i was yung
[01:20:59] <KatrinValerie> Not all of shippuden
[01:21:15] <AmalLight> KatrinValerie sadly you have right
[01:21:15] <KatrinValerie> I skipped the unbearable fillers
[01:21:42] <AmalLight> naruto is shit for the last season
[01:21:42] <KatrinValerie> I mean, good shounen is kinda rare
[01:22:10] <AmalLight> KatrinValerie hunter hunter , kilua/hisoka/kuroro
[01:22:26] <KatrinValerie> And there's always a slightly questionable set of values attached
[01:22:40] <AmalLight> where you can people like this find in other anime ?
[01:22:57] <AmalLight> *where you can find people like this in other anime ?
[01:23:18] <KatrinValerie> I think you find characters with deeper development in other shows.
[01:23:51] <KatrinValerie> If you generally like characters with a messed up background and are fine with more mature stuff, Black Lagoon is pretty good.
[01:24:57] <AmalLight> KatrinValerie please don't talk about the Attack on Titan
[01:25:00] <mixfix41> Bco1981: either way if you really love binary base distro theres things like networking sure a hell of a lot easier on the oldest distros of choice . theres so much gossip that its a 9th wonder why people never install source base distros
[01:25:39] <KatrinValerie> AmalLight: I thought it was going to make a statement about fascism at some point, but it really only seems to glorify it, lol.
[01:25:46] <AmalLight> KatrinValerie ok but the power of nen is unique for every character
[01:25:47] <Bco1981> mixfix41: works perfectly, even finds my NAS's

[01:32:19] <mixfix41> Bco1981: well debian if you ignore the build system basically are trying to be arch without makepkg -s in reality
[01:32:24] <AmalLight> in true i think you are good country , all considering
[01:32:27] <KatrinValerie> we might get our next massive covid wave by then
[01:32:43] <KatrinValerie> we're failing at rasing the vaccination rate
[01:32:52] <KatrinValerie> And immunity from infection won't last till winter
[01:33:03] <AmalLight> KatrinValerie we are in covid time from three years ago
[01:33:18] <AmalLight> it's time to defeat it definitely
[01:33:20] <KatrinValerie> I think the last pandemic lasted four years
[01:33:22] <mixfix41> mine as well hit up fedora or even the newer silverblue as the spec files documentation you ll surely build one spec and know which source base distro you want next like debian arch or slackware
[01:33:48] <KatrinValerie> We are still in a much better situation than ever before during a pandemic
[01:34:07] <KatrinValerie> at least if you have access to medical care, wouldn't want to live in the USA right now
[01:34:28] <AmalLight> KatrinValerie right
[01:34:49] <AmalLight> be glad to live in germany and not in giordan ( i am living in italy )
[01:35:19] <AmalLight> but i have siblings in giordan , and there the situation is terrible
[01:36:21] <KatrinValerie> Well, I myself am pretty safe here for now.
[01:36:36] <AmalLight> XD  yes you are
[01:36:39] <jbwncster> Jordan?
[01:36:41] <mixfix41> was that just the gui interface Bco1981  it surely the rug will come off on you one day 
[01:36:50] <KatrinValerie> Hopefully people will come back to their senses after covid
[01:36:59] <KatrinValerie> but I kind of doubt it
[01:37:01] <jbwncster> KatrinValerie: nope
[01:37:06] <mixfix41> or maybe not but you always have to understand it eventually
[01:37:07] <AmalLight> jbwncster in jordan if you are poor now the situation is grave
[01:37:19] <jbwncster> AmalLight: I thought so
[01:37:36] <jbwncster> Best to get out to Europe or Oceania or South America
[01:37:55] <Bco1981> mixfix41: qterminal messes up the spacing so it looks stupid. using the exact same font and size in gnome-terminal and it looks the way it should.
[01:38:19] <AmalLight> jbwncster yes it is sadly but yes
[01:38:41] <jbwncster> I have family in a neighboring country
[01:38:47] <mixfix41> use konsole
[01:38:53] <jbwncster> C
[01:38:57] <KatrinValerie> Would steer clear of brazil
[01:39:00] <mixfix41> ive never heard of qterm
[01:39:02] <jbwncster> Use windows and hexchat
[01:39:05] <AmalLight> left to our-self country for find rich future , mm .. i don't know what is more matter
[01:39:09] <KatrinValerie> but that's also for personal reasons
[01:39:17] <jbwncster> KatrinValerie: Paraguay or Uruguay seem nice
[01:39:39] <KatrinValerie> Uruguay legalised cannabis iirc
[01:39:52] <jbwncster> And same sex marriage
[01:39:53] <AmalLight> KatrinValerie do you smoke ?
[01:39:57] <AmalLight> i hope no
[01:40:00] <KatrinValerie> Big plus for me, since I use it as a medication
[01:40:11] <jbwncster> Also it’s cheap compared to other countries
[01:40:16] <jbwncster> Cost of living isn’t bad
[01:40:22] <jbwncster> And getting residency is easy
[01:40:38] <KatrinValerie> AmalLight: it treats otherwise unmanagable nausea and bouts of pain for me.
[01:40:48] <jbwncster> To be a permanent resident in Paraguay you only need $4000 usd in your bank account locally for a year
[01:41:13] <jbwncster> And you need a permanent residence
[01:41:15] <AmalLight> KatrinValerie: o dear ok sorry for my last sentence
[01:41:17] <KatrinValerie> And it's the most effective mood stabilizer I have ever had.
[01:41:29] <jbwncster> AmalLight: it’s not for everyone
[01:42:20] <KatrinValerie> AmalLight: well, you should not judge too quickly when it comes to drugs in general. people who do drugs can still be good people, it is often the criminalisation that makes things become a bigger problem than it has to be.
[01:42:40] <KatrinValerie> And probably the worst drug is alcohol
[01:42:56] <mixfix41> it seems those two have strengths and weaknesses important is the reporting is both there i honestly cant tell if its bad
[01:43:02] <KatrinValerie> Which is widely socially accepted, even rather unhealthy drinking habits are still socially acceptable.
[01:43:10] <AmalLight> jbwncster oh yes i know if you ( generic ) have better family ( more rich ) , yes you can go outside only to study
[01:43:20] <AmalLight> and after that come back
[01:43:21] <mixfix41> i learn to not care about it so much in the beginning when i did it quickly melt away
[01:44:05] <mixfix41> also i do believe if its important in that respect developers are super welcoming to accept patches thats what the contact is for i know this
[01:44:06] <AmalLight> Katarushisu yes you have right .

[01:47:37] <AmalLight> KatrinValerie I want to precise only that usually i suggest to people to smoke or drink only if it is extremely necessary for them
[01:48:26] <AmalLight> my adoptive brother sold Mariuana when he was young ( for feeling more man i think )
[01:49:07] <AmalLight> and for this reason i never tried it and usually i am not drinking alcohol
[01:49:55] <mixfix41> i know im kinda going on about lubuntu.. is it they made it difficult as a wink about devbox ? i mean thats mind blowin
[01:50:33] <Bco1981> performance was extremly good. but it has issues.
[01:51:47] <mixfix41> no issues i know lubuntu the kernel shines above all else all you need 
[01:52:04] <mixfix41> i stop using it because i was so unfamiliar with the build system
[01:52:29] <Bco1981> once, only once, did i select 2560x1440 as resolution. then set the res to 1920x1080. after every reboot it would go back to 2560x1440. not matter how many times i saved, and reset.
[01:52:33] <mixfix41> ill put it in the back of my mind .. it may deserve some attention so i can help myself 8-D
[01:52:37] <AmalLight> ubuntu take a lot of information on 80 a 443 port
[01:52:45] <AmalLight> so be careful
[01:52:55] <AmalLight> on this commercial linux distribution
[01:54:41] <AmalLight> all apt usually can go on 80 and 443 port so in general can be good filter it before it go out

[02:09:23] <mixfix41> i remember when i was playing that one mmorpg i had a few scripts with multiple monitors that i would use it was not a big deal
[02:09:31] <Bco1981> won't save resolution settings for next boot... that's a issue.'
[02:09:36] <mixfix41> so i could get the resolution perfect
[02:09:49] <mixfix41> true its x11, but with the versatility of linux its easy to do 
[02:10:32] <mixfix41> you can set up an expect script and do it auto, you can see if xinitrc can manage it... its a workaround but youd have to patch that
[02:12:22] <Bco1981> to be fair, it might have been the virtualbox additions that messed something up, it kinda installed something, but failed.
[02:13:13] <Bco1981> i guess it's the same as with nvidia drivers... don't install the proprietary drivers.

[07:47:36] <MootPoot> but also....just dont splash water on it lol
[07:47:42] <amigojapan> Ashl3y4: it's normal in Japan for washlets
[07:48:04] <ButterNoodle> I think I did one pass on skyline with everything on and went kinda hard.. but not good in a place where there is farm equipment, driveways, and yuppies
[07:48:05] <Ashl3y4> hmm, I don't see plugs here in the US

[07:49:55] <MootPoot> or maybe I'm expecting too much
[07:49:56] <Ashl3y4> I've always imagine anything electricity in a bathroom spells instant death

[11:51:02] <Satin> okay....
[11:51:28] <PancakeMatsuri> does Lunar Vim have ALE?
[11:51:53] <Satin> uhhh
[11:51:57] <Satin> do i even have xclip

[12:05:34] <Satin> yeah then you probably did ours
[12:05:43] <MootPoot> had to do a eng writing class tho
[12:05:43] <gh0s1> I had APs so they counted that

[13:05:07] <Berlin37> ahem, that site was made for testing different vulnerabilities
[13:05:44] <amigojapan> Well that's bad, but yeah. That's why pure SQL is dangerous in the hands of novices. But it can be easily avoided using "prepared statements
[13:05:56] <Berlin37> scarry how you could just retrieve a whole database because of one vulnerability
[13:06:21] <Berlin37> amigojapan: I've read that there are companies and experienced people who do write in pure sql
[13:06:31] <Berlin37> but they sure know more about it :D
[13:07:08] <amigojapan> Berlin37: orms are implemented using SQL
[13:07:10] <Berlin37> i've a telegram bot that downloads music from youtube currently running SQLite
[13:07:40] <Berlin37> it is a very simple bot so it uses 2 or 3 pure sql queries
[13:08:13] <amigojapan> Sqllite is not very good. Unlike normal SQL servers, it does not check for type mismatches
[13:08:37] <Berlin37> it is much simpler indeed
[13:09:27] <Berlin37> wow, i've got about 300 rows of data in these database
[13:11:49] <amigojapan> Berlin37: I once wrote an invalid date to an sqllite database and the whole database for invalid. That can't happen with mysql
[13:12:02] <Berlin37> 59 unique IDs in that database
[13:12:13] <Berlin37> wow amigojapan, pretty dangerous
[13:13:28] <amigojapan> s/for/became/
[13:13:36] <amigojapan> Yup
[13:14:42] <Berlin37> are postgresql and mysql simillar?
[13:15:06] <amigojapan> Yes very similar
[13:15:26] <Berlin37> i exercised a bit on pgexercises.com (very nice site indeed) and i didn't even know i was exercising postgres at first :D
[13:15:45] <Berlin37> i thought it's mysql
[13:15:46] <amigojapan> All SQL use similar queries. With very small variations
[13:15:53] <Berlin37> yeah they do
[13:16:24] <amigojapan> That's their advantage
[13:16:55] <PancakeMatsuri> there's enough difference to warrant problems
[13:17:00] <PancakeMatsuri> of portability
[13:17:05] <amigojapan> And the disadvantages of orm is that you need to learn a while orm when you change to another one
[13:17:08] <Berlin37> and sql is not hard to learn at all, well at least basic sql
[13:17:19] <Berlin37> it's like chatting with your database in English :D
[13:18:15] <amigojapan> PancakeMatsuri: easy to port tho
[13:18:47] <PancakeMatsuri> amigojapan, not really. there are Pg-specific functions you use.
[13:18:53] <PancakeMatsuri> so it's a hassle
[13:19:01] <Berlin37> do you know Deftones? 
[13:19:01] <Berlin37> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL4MGwlZuAc

[13:19:34] <Berlin37> it's been my favorite music band since a while ago
[13:19:50] <amigojapan> PancakeMatsuri: pregnant a good idea too avoid using them
[13:20:08] <amigojapan> Probably*
[13:20:27] <PancakeMatsuri> amigojapan, well, it's a tradeoff
[13:20:46] <PancakeMatsuri> you'll get less of manual SQL with ORM
[13:20:58] <PancakeMatsuri> it's ORM that's easy to port
[13:21:04] <PancakeMatsuri> *ORM SQL
[13:21:05] <Berlin37> ye
[13:21:34] <amigojapan> PancakeMatsuri: not from one orm to another
[13:21:43] <PancakeMatsuri> amigojapan, no )
[13:25:25] <amigojapan> I was once tasked with porting a system written in BASIC to a GUI database thing for Mac (Mac way before os X) I was not ready for that task at the time yet
[13:26:16] <amigojapan> But I feel porting from one language to another is more common after a long time 
[13:26:41] <amigojapan> Neither database was SQL
[13:27:41] <Berlin37> i can't stand these online lessons anymore 
[13:30:35] <Bco1981> today, all covid restrictions has been removed here.

[13:31:17] <amigojapan> Bco1981: crazy
[13:31:35] <amigojapan> Bco1981: Omicron should be bad now
[13:31:47] <Bco1981> well, most of the resent cases is barely at the leve of the commen cold.
[13:31:52] <Bco1981> level*
[13:32:26] <Bco1981> with more the 75% that has gottten 3 vacines. people are barely sick from covid now.
[13:32:26] <amigojapan> Bco1981: in Japan we just reviewed economic help for Omicron
