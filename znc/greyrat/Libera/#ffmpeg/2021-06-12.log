[00:09:27] <Enverex> znf: I do eventually but the lengths are wrong before I reencode. Even ffprobe'ing the original file shows they don't match, but they're at least in sync in the original files.
[00:12:22] <Enverex> So I guess the original file has something in place that tells them when to start (or the video/audio simply ends before the other, which isn't an issue in playback, but is an issue for me).

[00:57:14] <Derrick> Hi, does anyone know how to use FFMPEG as a library in C++ as a opposed to just running the executable file?
[00:57:44] <Derrick> For example, rather than opening command prompt and running a command like "ffmpeg -i input.wav output.mp3"
[00:58:20] <Derrick> Is there a way where I can just write my own program in C++ and run a function like  "ffmpeg(input, output);"
[00:58:39] <BtbN> There is no library mimicking the ffmpeg CLI tool
[00:58:39] <furq> i mean you can use the libraries
[00:58:44] <furq> it'll be a bit more complicated than ffmpeg() though
[00:58:51] <BtbN> you can use the libav* libraries to implement the functionality yourself
[00:58:59] <furq> http://ffmpeg.org/doxygen/trunk/examples.html
[01:00:17] <Derrick> yeah I definitely understand it would be more complicated than that @furq but simply just to get it running without having to use the executable file I downloaded
[01:00:30] <Derrick> Okay so quick question
[01:01:01] *** u0_a141 is now known as xxx
[01:01:16] <Derrick> After adding the libav* libraries to my workspace, how would I go about adding the different filters in the functions?
[01:02:19] <Derrick> For example, say I wanted to use the silencedetect filter, how would I make it return the same output that it does when running the same command in cmd?
[01:03:41] <Derrick> If anyone knows that would be awesome, been struggling to implement this for a while now
[01:08:08] <Derrick> @bt
[01:08:25] <Derrick> BtbN where can I find the libav* libraries?
[01:08:55] <BtbN> What do you mean? They're part of ffmpeg. The cli tools also use them for everything, they are just a thin frontend.
[01:09:19] <BtbN> And you'll need to look up example and refer to the documentation/headers on how to use the API
[01:09:28] <BtbN> that's really not something to explain in a few lines of IRC chat
[01:10:57] <znf> I think that's one of the main reason people just run the ffmpeg binary in a lot of apps :P
[01:12:04] <Derrick> I think I may not have explained well the goal I'm trying to accomplish
[01:13:56] <znf> I think you did?
[01:16:50] <Derrick> Okay, I guess I'm just kind of confused with the solution. So essentially, could someone at least break down the steps I need to take in order to achieve this then
[01:17:03] *** Joins: pong (~loop@user/pong)
[01:17:47] <BtbN> Link against the required libav* libraries for your task, and use the API to do whatever it is you want to do
[01:19:08] <Derrick> Okay, so in my case I am trying to use "silencedetect"
[01:19:09] <Derrick> https://lists.ffmpeg.org/doxygen/trunk/af__silencedetect_8c_source.html
[01:19:16] <Derrick> which can be found here ^
[01:19:32] <BtbN> There is no filter specific API

[01:26:50] <JEEB> and trunk = master
[01:27:13] <Derrick> Okay, thank you
[01:27:47] <JEEB> I think the filtering example(s) only utilize one of the two ways the API can be utilized, but it should get you somewhere :)
[01:28:17] <JEEB> (the difference is whether you give out a string that defines the full filter chain, or if you go one by one and create/setup/connect the filters)
[01:28:55] <Derrick> Okay, and just to be sure, I should be able to use the API call to run a specific filter like silencedetect right?
[01:33:12] <BtbN> What do you mean?
[01:33:22] <BtbN> ffmpeg.c also just uses the libavfilter API, so, yes?
[01:33:38] <BtbN> But again, you won't find a "silencedetect API".

[02:45:27] <Enverex> Let me rephrase then; foes FFMPEG have any way, when extracting audio/video to pad one or either to make sure the outputted files are the same length and still synced?
[02:48:06] <furq> znf: avio_reading is a standalone program, it's one of the examples

[07:06:57] <Enverex> znf: I've tracked down the issue to something I wasn't expecting. So I need the output to be a video and audio file (not just audio) for reasons too complicated to explain right now. Originally I was just using a looping image, but I also tried lavfi which is simpler. Anyway, if I leave out that video side of things, the resulting size is correct.
[07:06:57] <Enverex> So it's something about this which breaks it. Here's the command line I'm using if anything stands out:
[07:07:33] <Enverex> ffmpeg -f lavfi -i "color=black:d=18000:size=32x32:rate=5,format=pix_fmts=yuv420p" -i "$audioFile" -map_metadata -1 -c:v libx264 -b:v 1000 -tune stillimage -profile:v baseline -level:v 1.0 -c:a libfdk_aac -vbr 2 -ac 1 -shortest -async 1 -max_interleave_delta 500M -movflags faststart "../$thisChannel.mp4" -n
[07:08:41] <furq> is the video stream shorter than the audio file
[07:09:44] <Enverex> There is no video stream, it's a dummy. It just needs to exist as long as the audio does.
[07:10:00] <furq> you're setting the duration though
[07:10:02] *** Joins: nd (~nd@user/nd)
[07:10:24] <Enverex> Yeah, 4 hours. The idea being that "-shortest" will end the encoding automatically when the audio ends.
[07:10:42] <Enverex> It also happened when trying the "-loop 1" image method, which doesn't require a duration.
[07:11:45] <furq> well yeah if the video stream is longer or infinite length then i've had this issue before
[07:12:02] <furq> the audio stream is fine but the duration of the file will be a few seconds over
[07:12:22] <furq> i think it's something to do with using an external video encoder with -shortest
[07:12:37] <furq> external as in lib* and not one of the builtin encoders
[07:14:46] *** Joins: aphysically (~aphysical@user/aphysically)
[07:14:49] <furq> iirc it only happens if you're encoding the audio but it's been a while

[07:16:02] <furq> never mind then
[07:16:20] <Enverex> The higher I increase the FPS, the closer the time gets oddly enough.
[07:16:34] <furq> yeah that makes sense for what i think the issue is
[07:18:16] <furq> which is that ffmpeg is just blindly sending frames to and receiving frames from the external encoder and so when -shortest takes effect you end up with a few extra seconds of video buffered that can't be trimmed off

[07:18:52] <furq> i'm not smart enough to have looked into it any more deeply though
[07:19:00] <furq> i just have anecdotal evidence
[07:19:59] <furq> the workaround would probably be to get the duration first with ffprobe and then use -t
[07:22:08] <Enverex> So it should be 01:38:12.63. At 5fps you get 01:38:21.00, at 25 you get 01:38:14.24, at 60 you get 01:38:13.27.
[07:22:33] <Enverex> Hmm, I could try and do that. Is there a super clean way to do that programmatically?

[07:50:00] <Enverex> Right, I'll leave it recoding everything overnight and see how it goes. Initial results looked good though so we'll see how it goes. Thanks furq.

[08:32:16] <KombuchaKip> I feed raw audio bits into the encoder. They come out the other side as compressed bits inside of a container that are normally written to disk by ffmpeg's API. Is there a way I can have it not write to disk, but to memory? Is the correct way to do this by implementing a custom AVIOContext with write capability?

[09:37:13] <znf> KombuchaKip, if you're using the ffmpeg binary, you can just write to a pipe
[09:37:27] <KombuchaKip> znf: Not using the binary. Doing through API.
[09:38:22] <KombuchaKip> znf: But I wonder if there's still a way to get it to write out to a pipe I already had open. I already have a custom AVIOContext that can read from memory, so I suppose I could augment it to handle writing to it as well.
[09:39:15] <znf> no idea :)

[22:49:29] <Derrick> BtbN do you happen to know if there already exists an FFMPEG Wrapper for C#?
[22:50:10] <BtbN> I'd be surprised if someone didn't make a wrapper for the libav* libs already
[22:51:38] <Derrick> After spending a day searching through Stackoverflow, StackExchange, and throughout the internet I couldn't seem to find it
[22:52:14] <BtbN> There's like 5 of them that come up in 5 seconds of google
[22:52:42] <Derrick> The ones that I did see invoke the use of the executable file
[22:54:16] <BtbN> There's also a bunch of wrappers for the libs
[22:54:23] *** Joins: mega (~iglosiggi@129-73-17-190.fibertel.com.ar)
[22:54:25] <BtbN> But how well maintained they are, you gotta judge for yourself
[22:54:29] <BtbN> ffmpeg just did a major bump after all
[22:56:11] <BtbN> https://github.com/Ruslan-B/FFmpeg.AutoGen looks okay to me? Though I don't need or use it, so you gotta pick what's best for you on your own
