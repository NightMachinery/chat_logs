[12:39:41] <toretto> Hi, I'm curious how using algorithms like Diffie Hellman result in 'perfect forward seecrecy'. Is that because the 'pre-master-secret' and 'master-secret' of a particular 'TLS session' is stored on the computer's *memory*, so once the session is finished, the memory is just overwritten such that, the things transfered between the TLS session cannot be decrypted(since we're not relying on the private key) 
[12:39:47] <toretto> right?
[12:39:52] *** Joins: ethoxy (~exit-host@slave.sapi01.de)
[12:42:21] <Peng> I don't remember precisely what the premaster secret and master secret are in TLS, but yes
[12:42:52] <toretto> I see. So, it totally relays on the computer's RAM properties. Like the crypto 
[12:42:57] <toretto> sorry, unfinished.
[12:43:41] <toretto> I see. So, it totally relays on the computer's RAM properties. Like the crypto API is written in a way that, once the TLS session is finished, the memory in RAM where the 'pre-master-secret' and the 'master-secret' is stored is *overwritten* right?
[12:43:55] <toretto> Like, it's manually overwritten by the SSL vendor.
[12:44:26] <Peng> Hopefuly ha ha ha ha :(
[12:45:05] <toretto> Peng: 'premaster secret' and 'master' is used in Diffie Hellman key exchange during the TLS Handshake. 
[12:45:14] <toretto> I'm sure you know that. 
[12:45:36] <Peng> Yeah
[12:46:43] <Peng> I just don't have a low-level protocol diagram in my head (and don't want to :P )
[12:47:12] <toretto> I see, but I just wanna make sure that I got that particular point right. 
[12:50:03] <Peng> There's also the possibility of the memory getting swapped out. :D
[12:52:15] <Wulf> toretto: the (pre) master secret derives from a diffie hellman key exchange using ephemeral (created for this session, then forgotten) keys.
[12:52:45] <Wulf> toretto: the certificates (server and perhaps client) are used only to sign the tls handshake which includes the ephemeral dh public keys
[12:53:26] <Wulf> toretto: so even if the certificate's private key is compromised later, a previously recorded session cannot be decrypted because the ephemeral dh key is gone.
[12:54:07] <yawkat> what does the "perfect" mean btw?
[12:55:19] <Wulf> yawkat: perfect = unbreakable?
[12:55:31] <Wulf> aside from brute forcing DH of course
[12:55:47] <yawkat> thats a pretty big aside, considering quantum computers :D
[12:56:24] <toretto> Wulf: Yeah, but the 'perfect forward secrecy' part of teh Diffie Hellman key exchange is guaranteed only because the 'pre master' and 'master secret' keys are stored in a volatile place like RAM/memory for example and once the TLS session is closed, the portion of RAM/memory which stores that keys are overwritten by the SSL vendor. So, once cannot "derive" the 'shared-secret' since the secret which is 
[12:56:29] <toretto> needed inorder to derive the 'shared-secret' is already overwritten in the RAM, right
[12:56:31] <Wulf> Yep. We might already be in serious trouble. We use short standard elliptic curves on all TLS sessions and NSA might record the TLS sessions to decrypt them later.
[12:56:32] <toretto> ?
[12:57:13] <yawkat> toretto: how the ephemeral key is implemented is an implementation detail, forward secrecy just means you dont use long-term keys for sessions
[12:57:15] <wasamasa> the question is whether they're worth breaking later
[12:57:52] <Wulf> toretto: it's about an crypto algorithm, not about implementation details. Of course you should wipe the secrets from ram. But even if you don't, it's still called PFS.
[12:58:12] <yawkat> Wulf: yea this is what irks me about the name "perfect" FS, since it's still broken if DH is broken
[12:59:26] <Wulf> Perhaps we would be better off with "classic" diffie hellman, e.g. using 4096 bit random prime groups and chaning them every now or then.
[12:59:49] *** Joins: abraham (~abraham@191.96.120.28)
[13:01:13] <toretto> Wulf: How it's still called PFS if they can read the contents of the RAM and decrypt the TLS session? I can understand it's called forward secrecy because we are not using the RSA keypair(which is long-term key). But the thing, in real world, which preserves it that implementation detail that the memory where we store those ephemeral key is overwritten hence even if someone breaks in, and analyzes the 
[13:01:19] <toretto> RAM, still the TLS session cannot be decrypted since there is no way to derive that 'shared secret'. I'm talking in the case of physical access to the computer.
[13:01:22] <toretto> yawkat: ^
[13:01:45] <Wulf> toretto: PFS is an algorithm, not the implementation.
[13:12:20] <Peng> I don't know why it was called "Perfect" Forward Secrecy. There might be a math reason for it, but as a colloquial term is it unfortunate, since reality is full of problems.

[13:42:29] <elichai2> Hi, is there a best practice in how to "upgrade" an encryption scheme? say there's a product currently using an insecure non-authenticated encryption scheme and they want to upgrade to AES-GCM/Chacha-poly, what will be the "best" way? My first thought is, try to decrypt using the authenticated encryption and if it fails fall back to the non-authenticated one
[13:42:52] <elichai2> but this means that forever an attacker could "downgrade" a user to the insecure encryption
[13:43:32] <elichai2> Other options is just writing in plaintext what encryption its using, but this has the same downside
[13:45:08] <wasamasa> look at TLS for a lesson of how things went in practice

[15:39:31] <MacGyver> Otherwise it's taking away a registered channel from one unregistered "community" and giving it to another, which they rightfully classify as the exact kind of power abuse that freenode's engaging in.
[15:39:42] <MacGyver> I'm with jess on this one.

[15:44:00] <bw> fine with me
[15:44:00] <MacGyver> I don't think anything will change *in practice* if we register as a community, mind.

[16:01:36] <MacGyver> The only technical thing that would change: we'd setup ##crypto as a redirect to #crypto, not the other way around.
[16:01:42] <MacGyver> I'm fine with that.
[16:03:08] <MacGyver> I'll wait for sarnold and hlieberman to chip in and then contact ... someone.
[16:06:34] <MacGyver> sarnold, hlieberman: In case you missed it, the context is that we've now got at least one confirmed case of someone almost not finding us due to the current situation, so I'm kinda done with waiting on Libera to update its guidelines.
