[15:03:39] <Ingvix> does this affect qutebrowser as well? https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2022/03/26/google-confirms-emergency-security-update-for-32-billion-chrome-users-attacks-underway/
[15:04:39] <The-Compiler> Ingvix: hard to say with no technical details, but probably
[15:04:52] <Ingvix> oh dear
[15:04:53] <The-Compiler> (given that it is in V8e
[15:04:57] <The-Compiler> s/e/)/
[15:08:23] <The-Compiler> don't see a backport at https://codereview.qt-project.org/q/project:qt/qtwebengine-chromium yet, but I suppose it's very fresh (reported on Wednesday, fix released on Friday)
[15:12:14] *** Joins: reset (~reset@user/reset)
[17:05:47] <triallax[m]> So can we expect a hotfix release or something?
[17:08:39] <The-Compiler> triallax[m]: as usual, you will get the fix via QtWebEngine, not qutebrowser. Unfortunately Qt doesn't usually expedite releases because of Chromium security bugs, but your distribution might chose to backport the fix before a new Qt release
[17:09:12] <The-Compiler> (unless you are using the macOS/Windows binaries of qutebrowser, then you're out of luck until qutebrowser supports Qt 6, unfortunately)
[17:09:15] <triallax[m]> What about macOS users?
[17:09:35] <triallax[m]> Ah, you beat me to it.
[17:10:20] <The-Compiler> there isn't any way for me to get a new Qt release into it without having to build things from source, I'm afraid (because of Qt LTS releases turning commercial only, and because of qutebrowser not really being ready for Qt 6 yet)
[17:11:14] <triallax[m]> So what are my options?
[17:12:33] <The-Compiler> maybe checking what Homebrew has to offer (for QtWebEngine, not qutebrowser), or building Qt/PyQt from source (which is quite a pain)
[17:12:53] <triallax[m]> Homebrew just uses the app bundle provided by Qutebrowser.
[17:13:03] <triallax[m]> It doesn't build it itself.
[17:13:08] <The-Compiler> hence "for QtWebEngine, not qutebrowser"
[17:13:17] <triallax[m]> Ah.
[17:13:31] <The-Compiler> you can run qutebrowser from source against a system-installed QtWebEngine (as long as you have a PyQt built against it)
[17:13:45] <The-Compiler> well, after there is a fix in of course, right now there isn't really much you can do either way
[17:13:58] <triallax[m]> I recall attempting to build Qutebrowser from source and giving up after a lot of pain.
[17:14:11] <The-Compiler> yeah, imagine why I'm not doing it ;)
[17:14:26] <The-Compiler> building QtWebEngine from source is enough of a pain on Linux, not gonna attempt it on macOS and Windows
[17:14:56] <triallax[m]> QtWebEngine is not on Homebrew. :(
[17:15:01] <The-Compiler> planning to pick the Qt 6 stuff up again soon, probably (finally) the coming week
[17:15:18] <The-Compiler> but even there you'd need to wait for a fix to get into a release
[17:15:54] <triallax[m]> Guess I have no choice but to switch back to Firefox for now.
[17:16:24] <The-Compiler> https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/qt%405.rb#L61-L65 looks like Homebrew does have QtWebEngine?
[17:16:55] <triallax[m]> Oh, I looked for it as a separate formula.
[17:17:38] <The-Compiler> looks like a Qt 5.15.9 is planned for "March 2022", remains to be seen if a fix still makes it in in time
[17:17:41] <The-Compiler> afk now though
