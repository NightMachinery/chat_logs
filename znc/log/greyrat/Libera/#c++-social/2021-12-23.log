[17:17:08] <Bullit> I am in a realm where i can buy many ¨ornamental¨ lightthing, what was banned was the inefficientness of the lamp versus how many watts it pulled, but a gypsy with a radio doesnt want its lamp to function on the amperage going through as relation of how much light emittes, it wanted to voltage control the lightbulb so he could have bluer and whiter effects, wether the resistance of a carbon wire at the ideal temperature in th
