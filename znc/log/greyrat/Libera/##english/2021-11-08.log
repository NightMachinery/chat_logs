[01:48:20] <Tirili> Hi
[01:48:28] <Tirili> Is this correct English?:
[01:49:02] <Tirili> "This is a framework to study machine learning on the popular board game Chess."
[01:49:21] <Tirili> I am wondering about the word "on", here.
[01:49:30] <LjL> sounds correct to me. but yeah i'd also not be sure about what is meant by "on"
[01:49:39] <LjL> it's not incorrect, but maybe not perfectly clear
[01:49:55] <Tirili> ok, thanks, but how would you say it?
[01:50:16] <LjL> i'm not sure. i could say "using" or "with" but does it really clarify?
[01:50:38] <Tirili> Would "in" make sense?
[01:50:43] <LjL> if you're making the machine learn about chess, then "on" is not incorrect
[01:50:46] <LjL> no
[01:51:19] *** Joins: cthulchu (~Cthulchu@193.194.107.250)
[01:51:26] <LjL> "in" would just sound wrong. "on" sounds fine grammatically, it may just not make the meaning perfectly clear
[01:52:09] <LjL> explaining better in the readme is also a thing ;) so maybe "on" is fine
[01:52:22] <Tirili> The meaning is that with this framework, people can create machine learning agents for the game chess.
[01:52:46] <LjL> yes, that's what i guessed, it's basically just that i wouldn't feel 100% sure about that guess
[01:54:41] <Tirili> ok, I'll just say "Framework to create machine learning agents for the game chess."

[09:12:23] <iroha> Why doesn't this sound wrong? "My favorite subject is English. So, I study to be an English teacher."
[09:12:34] <iroha> But this does: "His favorite subject is English. So, he studies to be an English teacher."
[09:13:46] *** Joins: zzap (~zzap@user/zzap)
[09:15:00] <iroha> You could use present prog and just say "So, I'm studying to be..." or "So, he's studying to be..." and both those sound correct to me, but I can't figure out why only the first-person of the previous example does. Could also be I've been staring at it for too long and convinced myself that's the case...
[09:15:54] <kronicmage> iroha: your second sentence sounds right to me
[09:22:12] <iroha> Hmn, maybe...It's definitely proper English though? Just taking some implied habit with simple present ("I study (everyday)") instead of explicitly progressive? Since I'd consider them to mean the exact same, if someone said them to me.
[09:24:03] <twb> iroha: the only thing I dislike there is "I study" rather than "I am studying".
[09:24:24] <twb> Which also affects your second sentence (s/I/he/)
[09:24:40] <Me-me> Present tense in that context almost seems archaic. I could imagine a 1750s English lord saying "he studies", or possibly "he presently studies". But these days it sounds too formal to be natural - even in a formal context. That's my take, at least.

[09:26:03] <iroha> Yeah, if someone asked me "how would I say this idiomatically" I'd probably offer present progressive, but the first examples were presented to me first and didn't immediately set my brain off with "this is wrong".
[09:26:37] <Me-me> Linguistic drift makes fools of all immortals.
[09:26:38] <iroha> The first-person one, that is, but while trying to figure out why it doesn't sound wrong I thought about the third-person and that one did...so

[09:35:13] <iroha> Is there any tense/mood that ties in with determination? Thinking about "I believe in this country. So, I fight to be king." as a heavier example. You could speculate about someone else since that seems like an attitude that would be projected: "He believes in this country. So, he fights to be king." and that sounds fine now (to me).

[15:51:30] <FishBone000> What does "shouldn't" mean in "Please, exercise caution and it shouldn’t pose you any harm."? Does it mean that "If you are cautious enough, it won't pose you any harm.", or "Please be careful, and I don't want you to be harmed."?

[15:53:39] <Me-me> It's a classic scientific approach - not that you expect [harm], but in that nobody can ever be sure of anything, his best understanding is that there won't be [harm].
[15:53:55] <Me-me> It's more intellectually honest that way.

[16:46:32] <[itchyjunk]> i am guessing i have to kinda quote the whole thing somehow
[16:50:23] <Me-me> There are various ways to formalise the opening of a quote.

[16:50:51] <Me-me> "I knew him, Horatio."
[16:51:45] <Me-me> You can also simply say, "Begin quote:" and finish with "End quote," which in written text is usually accompanied by some sort of stylistic indicator, like indentation or italic text.
[16:52:10] <Me-me> Though the same is true of any quotation, really.

[18:17:56] <kurahaupo> ln: the +er suffix almost always works, though it's sometimes spelt +or
[18:18:14] <huf> dont think shower really works
[18:18:20] <huf> showor is right out
[18:18:47] <huf> shower is either an entirely different word or the word for a big dick
[18:19:16] <kurahaupo> ln: If you feel uncomfortable with "shower" then the appropriate synonym depends on what is being shown: an object, an idea, a lesson, etc

[18:20:36] <kurahaupo> (note that "shower" (one who shows) and "shower" (light rain, or a method of washing) are pronounced differently)
[18:21:00] <LuisP14> etymology2: 1. One who shows.
[18:21:00] <LuisP14> 2. An object or activity that is shown in a contest.
[18:21:00] <LuisP14> 3. (slang) A man whose penis is close to its full (erect) size when flaccid.
[18:21:04] <LuisP14> :3
[18:21:05] <LuisP14> :x
[18:21:56] <kurahaupo> LuisP14: "same size" doesn't necessarily mean "big"
[18:22:20] <huf> eh
[18:22:29] <LuisP14> copied from wiktionary :3
[18:22:40] <huf> I think the whole grower/shower was invented by people with small penises to make themselves feel better
[18:22:48] <huf> but yeah
[18:22:48] <kurahaupo> does it say which country's slang?
[18:22:52] <huf> ostensibly that's not what it means
[18:23:00] <Me-me> Homographs.
[18:23:30] <LuisP14> don't know where you see "same size"
[18:24:24] <LuisP14> copied as is
[18:24:51] <kurahaupo> "minimum size is close to full size" is equivalent to "full size is close to minimum size"
[18:25:57] <kurahaupo> size of A is close to size of B == A & B are close to the same size
[18:26:41] <kurahaupo> LuisP14: ^^^
[18:27:17] <kurahaupo> I merely elided "close to"
[18:27:40] <LuisP14> o.o
[18:27:54] <kurahaupo> well it didn't affect my argument

[18:31:04] <Me-me> Okay.
[18:31:38] <Me-me> You can definitely see that there's a comparison to be made between "close to [size]" and "same [size]". A parallel to be drawn. Sure, easy enough.
[18:32:10] <Me-me> But there's a second insinuation in what you said. To be perfectly blunt: Who was calling it "big"? Where did that come from?
