[00:39:35] <hassoon> foo: what ??
[00:40:03] *** Joins: GuiToris (~GuiToris@user/guitoris)
[00:41:25] <GuiToris> hello, I use a background image, no-repeat and size 100%. I was wondering if I could repeat only the edge pixels if the browser has a different ratio than the image?
[00:41:56] <GuiToris> If I resize the window, the edges will be black
[00:44:24] <hassoon> GuiToris: different ratio ?
[00:45:09] <GuiToris> I think yes, I have different landscape and portrait images, but the landscape can be off easily
[00:45:21] <GuiToris> and I have black bars, if you know what I mean
[00:45:37] <hassoon> black bars? i suggest you make us a fiddle first
[00:45:56] <hassoon> and this image we are talking about too
[00:46:26] <GuiToris> hassoon, is this okay? https://bpa.st/raw/WNFQ
[00:46:57] <hassoon> GuiToris: nope
[00:47:04] <hassoon> GuiToris: a fiddle means a whole working example
[00:47:35] <GuiToris> how could I show that?
[00:47:48] <hassoon> GuiToris: https://ghanhass.github.io/myfiddle/
[00:48:49] <GuiToris> ok, this is way beyond my knowledge, can I specify a non black background beside my background image?
[00:49:00] *** Quits: sQVe (~sQVe@user/sqve) (Quit: Bye!)
[00:49:04] <GuiToris> I would choose a color that is not black then
[00:49:34] <GuiToris> I tried adding background right next to background-image but it didn't work
[00:49:41] <hassoon> GuiToris: you can specify a different bg image for each window range of sizes
[00:50:51] <GuiToris> I don't know css that well, can you tell me how I can simply specify a background color that would be under my background image?
[00:51:31] <GuiToris> I use css yearly, sorry for not being so competitive :(
[00:52:15] <hassoon> GuiToris: you mean a transparent background image under which there is a black color ?
[00:54:02] <GuiToris> I tried using a transparent image but then I changed my mind about it and I created a transparent image with gimp, that is not transparent anymore, but it looks like as if it were transparent. Anyways, if the windows ratio is way different than the image's ratio I got black bars
[00:54:28] <GuiToris> if there was a lightblue background beneth me image, it wouldn't look that horrible
[00:56:51] <GuiToris> I can't share you the actual image that I'm using but the bar looks exactly like this: https://i.stack.imgur.com/NgHc8.jpg
[00:57:01] <GuiToris> (I know it's a wallpaper here)
[00:57:19] <GuiToris> but if it wasn't black at the bottom, it wouldn't be that obvious, I guess
[00:57:53] <GuiToris> I realized I couldn't use both background-image and background at the same time
[01:00:17] <GuiToris> I may have found a shorthand for that
[01:21:06] *** Joins: matsaman (~matsaman@user/matsaman)
[01:22:26] <hassoon> GuiToris: you can use 2 pseudo elements, e.g ::before and ::after, the first contains a semi transparent background image, and the other contains your color, beneath the first one
[01:23:47] <GuiToris> thank you, I'm using this shorthand background: url('images/checked.png'), #6DB3F2; which isn't that pretty but doesn't look that horrible either
[01:24:05] <GuiToris> I realized why the background was black, because the nightmode was activated

[18:23:07] <ZenixOwler> question, anyone knows how to make the <form> to be displayed at the exact middle of any screen ? here is my codes https://jsfiddle.net/7dkojhqs/
[18:27:40] <nbjoerg> ZenixOwler: you can center it horizontally with position absolute and left: 35%
[18:27:58] <nbjoerg> ZenixOwler: but to center it vertically, I think you will also need to set the height explicitly and use top accordingly?
[18:28:45] <ZenixOwler> Hm, not sure why left : 35 % tho
[18:28:53] <ZenixOwler> but my screen doesn't do it well
[18:28:54] <nbjoerg> 50% - half of the width
[18:29:19] <ZenixOwler> oh god, now it is getting weirder like it is moving too left
[18:29:32] <ZenixOwler> i guess there isn't any automatic way i can arrange this ?
[18:29:32] <nbjoerg> hm. sec, let me try something
[18:29:51] <ZenixOwler> i am thinking of getting javascript involved in case there is no possible automation with CSS
[18:31:51] <nbjoerg> https://jsfiddle.net/025kncme/
[18:31:54] <nbjoerg> try that one
[18:32:15] <nbjoerg> you miight need a bit more compat glue like -ms-transform depending on your target browser
[18:33:02] <ZenixOwler> -ms-transform ?
[18:33:12] <ZenixOwler> google hardly give any result tho
[18:33:54] <nbjoerg> see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform#browser_compatibility
[18:36:56] <ZenixOwler> most browsers i try with works the same tho
[18:36:58] <DPA> https://jsfiddle.net/d0qyv415/
[18:37:08] <ZenixOwler> without more extra transformation
[18:37:12] <ZenixOwler> except that nasty IE

[18:38:36] *** Joins: Akimb (~Akimb@86.100.13.100)
[18:38:37] <ZenixOwler> idk what u mean by that tho, i didn't change anything
[18:38:41] <ZenixOwler> but IE changed everything
[18:39:07] <nbjoerg> for IE you could use the approach I mentioned with the matrix transform, see the compat notes
[18:40:01] <DPA> I mean, can you only change the CSS, or is a HTML solution fine too?
[18:41:57] <ZenixOwler> DPA: the HTML is intact tho, but CSS is completely different
[18:42:03] <ZenixOwler> it doesn't even set the background to black
[18:42:34] <ZenixOwler> DPA: also for some reason your version works perfectly, but which did u change
[18:42:41] <ZenixOwler> i can't really see anything else beside that margin : auto
[18:42:53] <nbjoerg> veritical align on the body + auto margin
[18:43:09] <nbjoerg> auto margin gives horizontal centering
[18:44:21] <ZenixOwler> awh, and also did that display : flex
[18:44:27] <ZenixOwler> inside body, yea that's cool
[18:44:43] <DPA> This should even work in IE5: https://jsfiddle.net/ykaosLw4/
