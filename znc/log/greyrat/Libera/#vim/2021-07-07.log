[01:19:41] <gosukiwi> Hi guys, is it normal for my backspace key to not dedent in SASS filetype? Indentation works fine with tab, but when I press <BS> in an indented empty line, I expect to dedent one level, but instead of just deletes one character. This doesn't happen in other filetyles, such as HAML, and I can't seem to figure out how to configure that :(

[01:42:51] <kevr> hwrd: Perhaps it is. Is there a better protocol to use?

[01:43:21] <kevr> hwrd: I can use ssh:// ?
[01:43:38] <hwrd> no, I think it's scp. There's no ssh. Hence my surprise.

[01:44:23] <kevr> thank you for the effort/help!
[01:45:22] <hwrd> but actually, I'm guessing that's why remote directories don't work as you're expecting? I'm guessing under the hood, it's scp'ing the remote file to your host, and when you write, it scp's it back to the remote?
[01:45:39] <hwrd> so with a directory that doesn't yet exist it's not working as you are expecting?
[01:46:21] <hwrd> I'm assuming it's not gonna work with directories at all in fact.

[21:37:20] <romainl> [...]you _may_ end up[...]
[21:38:24] <romainl> with / and ? you search what you have your eyeballs on, which is by definition in the visible part of the buffer

[21:41:42] <backleet> romainl: ah I see, the first match starts from where the cursor is
[21:42:10] <romainl> yes
[21:43:04] <backleet> I still find 10j or 10k easier than reaching for / and typing 2-5 characters and more precise
[21:43:07] <backleet> I guess
[21:43:24] <romainl> if you are in the top part of the viewport and want to reach something you see in the bottom side, then /something (or shorter) will let you there without having to do math or look up line numbers
[21:44:09] <backleet> yep, unless there are /something in the middle too
[21:45:35] <romainl> you see getUserName, you want to to go there, /getU<CR> is the most intuitive compared to looking left at the line number and using it which is completely disconnected to the task at hand and moreover forces you to then get to to getUserName wit www or whatever
