[13:56:35] <Carbonflux> "projection, the mental process by which people attribute to others what is in their own minds."
[13:58:27] <Carbonflux> so, Nvidia just announced that you can "rent" a 3080 for 20$ a month on Geforce Now.
[13:59:18] <Carbonflux> i do think this is part of their effort to get them out of the hands of crypto miners, or at least share them.
[14:00:05] <Carbonflux> i cause someone could hide mining inside a desktop game like the do mobile.
[14:02:55] <MaNI> sounds more like a cash grab, they want the same lucrative and horrible rental model that the rest of the world has been moving too
[14:03:15] <MaNI> they care about money not some rigteous notion of protecting gamers from miners
[14:04:19] <T`aZ> obviously
[14:05:16] <MaNI> I'd  have put a captain obvious emoji but we aren't on slack so don't have those
[14:05:18] <Carbonflux> ya
[14:05:53] <Carbonflux> still, i do want to try some games that support ray tracing.
[14:06:20] <ERROH> my company is already discussing how we can use our relief involvement for marketing
[14:10:16] <Carbonflux> its cynical but perhaps it does promote more contributions from corporations. Its certainly something activists take advantage of.
[14:20:48] <ERROH> i guess
[14:21:06] <ERROH> 'logo for code' sounds better than 'soul for rubles' like in your case
[14:32:45] <Carbonflux> well, you know, Capitalism.
[14:32:50] * Carbonflux shrugs
[14:33:02] <Carbonflux> best, worst solution.
[14:33:29] <Carbonflux> its better than neo-colonial crypto-fascism.
[14:35:50] <Carbonflux> leveraging self interest to produce a balance of forces is difficult because of a lack of top down control, rejecting strong ideas of purity.
