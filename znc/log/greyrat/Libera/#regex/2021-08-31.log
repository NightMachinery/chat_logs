[00:05:58] <purplex> it's because you have \r\n line endings.

[00:07:57] <ZZzz> is there a way to adopt the regex to cover also such case?
[00:08:15] <purplex> try changing every \n to \r\n
[00:08:28] <ZZzz> ok
[00:08:58] <purplex> The file on linux can have \r\n as well depending on text editor.
[00:09:06] <JohnDoe2> [\r\n]+ is probably a safer bet
[00:09:57] <purplex> yea that may handle \n and \r\n depending on situation
[00:16:40] <ZZzz> purplex: is this how you mean it?  https://paste.debian.net/1209686/
[00:17:00] <ZZzz> I tried first just to replace \n by \r\n
[00:18:22] <ZZzz> if you want to try it without building/compiling - just use Gedit or Builder
[00:19:38] <purplex> yea, does it work?
[00:20:42] <ZZzz> no, same result
[00:21:04] <ZZzz> I test in Gedit... I doubt it dumps \r\n by default...
[00:21:21] <purplex> change \r\n to \r?\n everywhere
[00:24:15] <ZZzz> :-(  the same
[00:25:42] <purplex> it must be that widget using different regex flavor somehow, i can confirm it working in my editor
[00:26:45] <purplex> did you really get the same result?
[00:27:00] <purplex> or, same = not working but different error

[00:43:12] <ZZzz> yes
[00:43:34] <purplex> do i need a plugin to search regex in gedit then?
[00:43:45] <purplex> i don't have find by regex option
[00:44:02] <ZZzz> I don't try to find with regex...
[00:44:14] <ZZzz> one second...
[00:44:27] <purplex> hm?
[00:44:57] <purplex> ok, i have "match using regex" option
[00:45:27] <purplex> hidden under magnifying glass (such a way to hide stuff)
[00:45:34] <purplex> with no hint
[00:47:44] <ZZzz> Please try this:
[00:47:47] <ZZzz> https://gitlab.com/pninim.org/dar/dar-syntax#enable-dar-in-gedit
[00:48:09] <ZZzz> and use this file to check whether it works on your side:
[00:48:37] <ZZzz> just open it in gedit:
[00:48:39] <ZZzz> https://gitlab.com/pninim.org/dar/dar-syntax/-/blob/master/syntax.dar
[00:49:08] <ZZzz> (after downloading dar.lang to the proper place and restarting gedit)
[00:54:35] <ZZzz> (what I try to do is to enable syntax highlighting using regex)
[00:54:36] <purplex> works as expected in gedit
[00:55:30] <purplex> when i created a new file in gedit it was already using \n for newline 
[00:55:30] <ZZzz> what?!... can you please send a screenshot of that place with the footnote [^1]...
[00:56:14] <ZZzz> (its inside syntax.dar)
[00:59:33] <purplex> Well, I am not downloading any of .dars. I just ran the regex exactly from regex101 into gedit for a quick test.
[00:59:37] <purplex> https://i.imgur.com/vAqHexZ.jpg
[01:00:50] <purplex> I suggest you try the same with a new file in gedit.
[01:03:58] <ZZzz> yes, this works for me as well
[01:04:43] <ZZzz> but not from dar syntax definition file (dar.lang)
[01:05:54] <ZZzz> here is the line:
[01:05:56] <ZZzz> https://gitlab.com/pninim.org/dar/dar-syntax/-/blob/master/dar.lang#L291
[01:13:04] <purplex> Probably its not a regex problem anymore, but something about dar syntax...
[01:13:57] <purplex> anyway, I gtg. You can check this with 'linux' people for help
[01:14:18] <ZZzz> could be... thank you very much!

[13:14:29] <Me-me> Well, the answer is probably. It depends on your tool.

[13:39:10] <re101-gar-3> there's an undocumented regex used in codebase..
[13:39:12] <re101-gar-3> r'^\s*$'
[13:39:26] <re101-gar-3> can you pls help me understand what that means?
[13:39:52] <Me-me> r just means "regex". Then ' on the start and end are the delimiters. The actual pattern is ^\s*$
[13:40:01] <re101-gar-3> it's not whitespaces?
[13:40:03] <Me-me> ^ means "at the start" and $ means "at the end"
[13:40:11] <Me-me> The \s* means "zero or more whitespaces"
[13:40:31] <Me-me> So what it all says is, "Make sure there is nothing other than whitespaces in this string."
[13:40:32] <re101-gar-3> great thanks.. Me-me.. 
[13:41:16] <Me-me> Happy to help.
[13:41:29] <re101-gar-3> so if I wanted add more rules like r'[<>]=?|=' which is basically >=, <=, <, > along with whitespaces
[13:41:38] <re101-gar-3> what can the regex be?
[13:42:22] <Me-me> r'^\s*(?:[<>]=?|=)\s*$'
[13:43:05] <re101-gar-3> the characters ? : etc.. match anywhere in the string?
[13:43:29] <Me-me> No, those mean it's a non-capture group. Without them the regex stores the matched contents for later use.
[13:44:22] <re101-gar-3> regex are confusing... thanks Me-me.. 🙏

[14:48:24] <re101-gopher-22> gonna try
[14:49:20] <digitok> that will just match from http to the next space
[14:49:43] <Me-me> And, hypothetically, give some false positives.
[14:54:39] <digitok> yep, surprisingly, url matching as slightly more complicated than that

[19:34:20] <cloud> hi all. I have this sample of output that I want to get the data between patterns: https://dpaste.org/vmZL/slim#L2,14,15,27,28,40 --  the pattern start would be "my_pattern:", but I'm not sure how to proceed with the pattern end, as it would need to be the line containint the **asterisks**, but there is another line in the middle also containing
[19:34:21] <cloud> asterisks. could anyone help me with a sed or awk command? I don't need grep, as it's not compiled with pcre, so I can't use some of the options it provides
[19:35:16] <cloud> also, the lines between the pattern start and pattern end are not always containing the same data
