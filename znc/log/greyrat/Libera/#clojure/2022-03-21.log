[20:15:13] <Para> Took some time to debug my last Friday's week-of-year issue. Welp, looks like 2168-01-01 is week 1 according to GitHub Actions runner, while in ISO weeks the first three days of 2168 are week 53.
[20:15:24] <Para> Now I wonder which tire I need to kick to get this working...
[20:18:31] <Para> Reading documentation I have either 1) misconfiguration somewhere implicitly 2) unearthed a bug in GitHub Actions runner 3) unearther a bug in OpenJDK 17's MacOS build
[20:20:07] <Para> I want to lean on the first one, because it's the only one I can impact.
[20:26:00] <ridcully_> wikipedia states, that the 53th week only happens, when 1st is a thursday or wednesday in leap years?
[20:28:15] <seebs> i think it says something about the clojure community that everyone just sort of takes it as a given that worrying about week numbers being wrong in 2168 is Reasonable Engineering.

[20:51:33] <seebs> this is perhaps the best time to point out that the gregorian calendar has a multiple of 7 days per 400 years, and as a side-effect of this, the 13th of a month is slightly more likely to be a Friday than it is to be any other day of the week.
[20:53:21] <Para> And the original Friday 13th comes from the betrayal of Knights Templar which happened on Thursday 11th, in Julian calendar, which back-translates to Friday 13th in Gregorian.
[20:53:52] <Para> leah2: that prints correctly, so it's something about localization when printed through the formatter, then
[21:04:19] <mbuf> In https://github.com/dm3/clojure.java-time, how do I get the hour and minutes from an epoch value such as 1647880373?
[21:07:13] <seebs> do you want local or UTC hour and minutes
[21:07:38] <technomancy> ((juxt (memfn getHours) (memfn getMinutes)) (java.util.Date. 1647880373000))
[21:07:51] <technomancy> if all you need is minute/hour you don't need a library
[21:07:54] <mbuf> seebs, UTC is fine
[21:08:06] <technomancy> damn we need a bot in here
[21:08:21] <mbuf> technomancy, how do I get it without the hour and minutes without a library?
[21:08:39] <technomancy> mbuf: I literally just showed you
[21:08:58] <mbuf> technomancy, yes, just tried it; what does juxt and memfn do?
[21:09:27] <technomancy> memfn takes a symbol identifying a method and turns it into a function
[21:09:38] <technomancy> but you can just call (.getHours d) on a java.util.Date
[21:09:45] <technomancy> I just wanted to demonstrate it as a 1-liner

Any suggestion on best options to create an app w/ front and backends, connects to emacs (seems shadow-cljs is the preferred method now?), and uses re-frame?

[22:22:36] <bmd> oh, interesting. Thanks
[22:23:14] <Para> of course if luminus provides a template for it, sure, why not

[22:34:21] <technomancy> how is that related to multiple repos?
[22:35:40] <ridcully_> the main gain for me with shared code is, that i can run the tests with kaocha on the jvm for the "core stuff".  yeah, it's not 100% sure it will run later in cljs, but i have my e2e tests there
[22:35:57] <bmd> maybe i'm doing it wrong, but my frontend app is launched from a different port than the backend api, so csrf prevents the frontend from accessing the backend unless you add the magic header to say it's okay
[22:36:18] <ridcully_> if you can get your cljs stuff fro cljsjs, leiningen with just cljsbuild and figwheel if very easy to setup
[22:36:22] <technomancy> bmd: well, like ... stop doing that, I guess? =)
[22:36:41] <technomancy> there's no reason to use separate ports just because you have separate repos
[22:36:46] <ridcully_> for shadowcljs you want something to run node and other things (ideally isolated since the node-ipc meltdown)

[22:38:51] <bmd> ridcully, could you share a command that builds a new project w/ all-the-stuffs? Seems you have already solved what my issue has been
[22:40:59] <ridcully_> bmd: i can share a project, that uses dockerized shadow-cljs - but it's client only (uses nginx with public resources as server)
[22:43:25] <bmd> ah, i need a backend api too. Thanks though
[22:44:03] <ridcully_> i'd expect, that luminus nowadays comes with a shadow option?
[22:45:20] <Para> +shadow-cljs indeed seems to be listed in luminus template https://github.com/luminus-framework/luminus-template
[22:45:26] <Para> In fact that's _quite_ a list of stuff.
[22:46:10] <ridcully_> and cljsbuild+figwheel is the default as the doc there state
[22:47:47] <bmd> cool, thanks. Will start a new project and see how it goes :^).
[22:47:52] <Para> figwheel-main is IMO pretty good
[22:49:04] <technomancy> the old cljs frontend at work spun up it's own HTTP server and I could not for the life of me ever figure out why
[22:50:19] <bmd> i liked figwheel when i used it 5 years ago. I wasn't sure if the clojure world had moved on from it, and didn't want to start a new project w/ something that maybe was going to be deprecated
[22:51:41] <bmd> isn't an http server needed for the websocket to inform the web browser to load the new changes?
[22:51:50] <ridcully_> figwheel still works fine.  there is it's successor figwheel-main.  and shadow has it it's own figwheel-alike-feature
[22:52:47] <technomancy> bmd: you need a connection for the repl; sure, but this was distinct from the repl connection.
[22:53:19] <technomancy> honestly it's been so long that I forget most of the details.
[22:54:00] <Para> My current project has devmode...something for figwheel and its websocket. The actual resources come from the backend, and in fact index.html is entirely rendered using hiccup on backend which is surprisingly useful.
[22:54:31] <Para> I actually haven't even looked into what that devmode frontend thing is. Probably whatever was new&cool in 2018.
[22:55:09] <ridcully_> the default figwheel add a devmode thingy, that allows clj(s) edn to be printed in the console etc
[22:55:49] <ridcully_> i am not sure, if it also adds to allow navigating cljs in the stacktrace or if this is just the src-thingymabob from the browser

[23:02:30] <bmd> i see i used the re-frame template on my project from 6 months ago (where i couldn't get both the front and backends to work together, but probably my ineptness rather than the template): lein new re-frame hyper +garden +re-com +routes +test +10x +cider +kondo +handler +less
