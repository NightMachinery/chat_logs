[07:42:19] <rickame> anything wrong putting a header in a label?
[07:48:31] <rickame> ah ya mdn says not to damn
[07:49:44] <rickame> oh no says dont put heading in label, header must be fine then
[07:52:53] <\f> rickame: check the "Permitted content" section of the Technical Summary on the MDN for <label>.
[08:00:09] <rickame> \f oh crap, so that says phrasing content but header is flow content but not phrasing content
[08:00:15] <rickame> that mean i can't use header in label?
[08:09:42] <\f> rickame: yes. It’s not recommended.
[08:09:48] <rickame> ok i wont ty
[08:09:54] <rickame> just use some divs?
[08:10:04] <\f> What is the goal?
[08:10:27] <rickame> i wanna put a couple texts on 1 line in the label
[08:10:46] <rickame> 1 on left side, other on right
[08:11:12] <\f> Sounds like two <span>’s?
[08:14:18] <\f> <span>Some text</span><span>Some more</span>
[08:16:28] <rickame> need first text left aligned and second text right aligned
[08:18:58] <\f> Add some CSS to the <label>. Something like `display: inline-flex; justify-content: space-between;` will probably do. Just observe if the label takes all the space you want it to take and, if not, give it some more.
[08:22:10] <rickame> https://jsfiddle.net/jfg7o0Lk/
[08:22:13] <rickame> like that
[08:26:18] <\f> rickame: that works. I would probaly not use the extra div inside the label, and would opt to use justify-content on the flex container instead of targeting the first child and giving it a `flex: 1`.
[08:29:39] <rickame> https://jsfiddle.net/jfg7o0Lk/1/ need to have longer text under the split text btw
[08:32:50] <\f> Can you give me an example of the content in a real label?
[08:33:31] <\f> Probably you don't want to use a label for what you have in mind. At least not for all of it.
[08:35:41] <rickame> https://jsfiddle.net/jfg7o0Lk/2/
[08:35:56] <rickame> just info about the form field
[08:36:40] <rickame> ill go to css channel
[08:37:28] <\f> rickame: for the CSS part, yes, it's the proper channel. But you don't want to use a label for all that info.
[08:37:35] <rickame> why not?
[08:37:53] <\f> The label is just for a caption. If you need to explain the form, you should use something else, probably a <p>
[08:38:07] <rickame> it's not explaining the form, it's explaining just that field
[08:38:21] <rickame> you can say "username" but then under it explain more about it
[08:39:09] <rickame> do screen readers read out label text automatically?
[08:39:38] <\f> When the user navigates to it, yes.
[08:39:48] <rickame> ok so that's why you don't want too much in there
[08:40:11] <rickame> k well the nice thing is when user clicks on text and it activates text input. can i do that with the longer text even if i leave it out of the label?
[08:43:54] <\f> rickame: I’m almost sleeping on my desk here (2:13am XD) so I’ll have to go. I’ll try to give you a bit more info though.
[08:44:12] <rickame> ty!!
[08:44:37] <rickame> i can solve it right now if there's a way i can make non-label text also activate form input on click
[08:45:15] <\f> If you want to explain something, use a paragraph before the form. Once the user clicks the form, they only want to know what the input is about, so they can fill it. It's like a regular form. You have rules explained, and then a bunch of fields.
[08:45:34] <rickame> nah im not doing it that way
[08:45:40] <rickame> it's a big long form wouldnt be usable
[08:49:43] <\f> rickame: I understand. Try looking at <fieldset> and <legend> on MDN, to try and break the inputs into logical units with some extra information. Sorry if I couldn’t help you more. :) Good luck!
[08:50:01] <rickame> np
[08:53:33] <\f> rickame: I highly recommend this if you can and want to dive deeper https://www.smashingmagazine.com/printed-books/form-design-patterns/
[08:54:48] <rickame> wish i could too poor
[08:55:01] <rickame> want to get web dev job soon so im practicing
[08:57:22] <\f> rickame: one last thing if you allow me. You can _bend_ the web, but always remember it comes with a price. And normally the ones who pay the price are the ones that need more. If you think of some design pattern that is so unique that it will require you to bend the rules, it will not be easy to make it accessible.
[08:57:47] <\f> Try to learn how things are supposed to work and adapt your design to it, if you want the web to work in your favor.
[08:57:47] <rickame> ya im prepared to take the text out of the label i already told yoyu
[08:58:03] <rickame> but you still havent told me how i can make the text i take out of label activate the textfield like the label does
[08:58:10] <rickame> is it even possible? without JS
[08:58:43] <rickame> you can have multiple labels for a field i think, maybe that'll work?
[08:58:51] <rickame> maybe screen readers only read first label?
[08:58:57] <rickame> automatically i mean

[15:11:31] <nbjoerg> that link will not use HTTP POST
[15:11:55] <hsv> hmm, it does seem to.
[15:13:36] <nbjoerg> well, the button does. the link doesn't
[15:13:41] <hsv> https://jsfiddle.net/ewjnxpoy/
[15:14:08] <nbjoerg> you can mostly make them look the same, except visited status of course
[15:15:27] <hsv> The GET link is rendered with the browser default font, whereas the POST link uses explicit font.
[15:16:41] <hsv> btw, i decided to use GET method for now.

[20:21:54] <stenno> gde33: what is it?
[20:22:33] <gde33> stenno: odd default behaviour if there are 2 summaries
[20:22:43] <gde33> in firefox
[20:22:51] <stenno> yes, because having more than one summary in a <details> is invalid markup
[20:23:08] <stenno> Permitted content One <summary> element followed by flow content.
[20:23:31] <gde33> well, then the followed up content contains an illegal tag?
[20:23:38] <stenno> correct
[20:23:44] <stenno> it contains another summary
[20:23:58] <gde33> which should be managed as followed up content not as part of the element
[20:25:25] <stenno> you can see it in the UA stylesheet:
[20:25:37] <stenno> details[open] > summary:first-of-type {
[20:25:39] <stenno>     list-style-type: disclosure-open;
[20:25:41] <stenno> }
[20:27:11] <stenno> validator.nu is also explicit:
[20:27:13] <stenno> Contexts in which element summary may be used:
[20:27:15] <stenno> As the first child of a details element.
[20:27:34] <gde33> I know how to properly use it but its just funny to see what it does 
[20:27:39] <gde33> this one is also funny https://jsfiddle.net/gaby_de_wilde/z20df6qx/1/
[20:28:11] <gde33> that works correctly it seems
[20:29:40] <stenno> yes, as you can see here, <details> are allowed inside <details>
[20:29:42] <stenno> https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interactive-elements.html#the-details-element
[20:31:28] <stenno> gde33: also valid https://jsfiddle.net/Lz14fy9e/
[20:32:27] <gde33> yeah. nesting them is a great feature
[20:32:52] <gde33> would it always print > Details regardless of language?
[20:34:14] <stenno> now clue how that would work
[20:34:43] <stenno> The first summary element child of the element, if any, represents the summary or legend of the details. If there is no child summary element, the user agent should provide its own legend (e.g. "Details").
[20:35:44] <stenno> hmm validator.nu seems to disagree
[20:35:48] <stenno> Error: Element details is missing a required instance of child element summary.
[20:36:30] <stenno> is it really required though? its not really clear from the specs
[20:37:42] *** Quits: vysn (~vysn@user/vysn) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[20:38:54] <gde33> as usual the default use case is done well. Its kinda odd, you would expect modules to be wonky at first and mature over time and build in functionality to be finished and well done.
[20:39:29] <stenno> wonder if validator.nu is bugged wrt this specific spec part
[20:40:12] <stenno> or if the wording in the specs is misleading
[20:41:43] <stenno> content model text implies it has to be the first and is required
[20:42:31] <stenno> but the first paragraph of the description implies that its optional and browsers should have a default case if its not provided
[20:42:38] <gde33> putting the one element inside the other makes polifill harder
[20:42:59] <lilmonkey``> stenno, the spec makes provisions for when invalid markup is supplied, is all.
