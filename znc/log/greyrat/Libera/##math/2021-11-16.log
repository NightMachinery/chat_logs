[00:01:52] <memorye> guys help me model this thing. i have a machine and it has two target regions. when i have the machine on low, i get 5 times as many hits in region A as in region B. when i turn it up high i get infinitely many hits in region A and in region B. the infinities are of the same cardinality.  should i still consider the infinity in A 5 times bigger in some sense though?
[00:02:09] <memorye> When i set the machine on low the number of hits is finite
[00:02:13] <memorye>  so i can compare the ratio
[00:02:31] <memorye>  but when i set it too high i get countably infinite in each region so same cardinality
[00:02:58] <memorye> Any thoughts that might illuminate this confusion?
[00:04:37] <memorye> Also i notice that when i turn it up high the hits always have at least one point that is a limit point for the hits
[00:04:38] <Z-module> You can't really apply common-sense size comparison things when infinite sets are involved.
[00:04:51] <Z-module> Z (the integers) is not "twice as big" of a set as 2Z (the even integers).
[00:05:03] <memorye> oh there are 5 times as many limit points in region A when i have it on high
[00:05:34] <memorye> Z-module: i knot the cardinality is not twice as much, but maybe in some other sense it still is twice as much

[00:06:02] <Z-module> well in this case, Z is a group and 2Z is a subgroup, and 2Z does have two distinct cosets in Z.  So yes in that sense.
[00:07:51] <memorye> should i turn the machine up even higher?
[00:07:54] <memorye> hold on
[00:08:03] <memorye> ok i turned it up higher.
[00:09:00] <memorye> the output looks almost the same as when it was on high, except there are some lines and branching lines, in addition to the infinitely many scattered points on each screen
[00:09:59] <memorye> If i measure the lines and branching lines. i find that the total lengths added up in the a region is about 5 times as long as the total lengths added up in the B region

[01:12:17] <somiaj> it is inidependent, there are valid theories that include AoC and valid ones that don't include it
[01:12:25] <mycroftiv> memorye: i think its true in real life for two reasons: you can make a constructive realizability model following Krivine that extracts computation from choice-based proofs, and physics can be seen as coding up various ultrafilters which are choiceful constructs
[01:12:34] <somiaj> there is even a middle ground where you allow countable choice but not infinite choice.
[01:12:43] <memorye> well if the axiom of choice itself is contradictory in some way then those wouldnt really be valid
[01:13:05] <somiaj> I personally think that the fact that every vector space has a basis is equivlant to AoC is a strong reason to assume it is true

[01:50:10] <fltrz> rule nr one of alternate reality games: this is not a game
[01:50:34] <rex_victor> droid3: wouldn't infinite chess be non-zero if the bank would double white's payout but not black's?
[01:53:22] <droid3> infinite chess depends on how you define the game.
[01:54:01] <droid3> if its modeled as a generalization of the finite game of chess to an infinite board
[01:54:25] <droid3> this would be a perfect information game still or can be defined to be
[01:55:00] <droid3> And it would be zero sum because the objective is either win , lose , or tie.
[01:55:43] *** Quits: Fleck (~fleck@user/fleck) (Quit: GOSUB w/o RETURN)
[01:56:14] <droid3> it is zero sum because a move benefiting one player would hurt the other player equally much.
[01:56:14] <rex_victor> ok so if you change the rules to "white wins when black king is checkmate" and "black wins when white king is checkmate or black king is checkmate"

[01:57:12] <fltrz> droid3: are you looking for a simplest mathematically describable game?
[01:57:14] <bildramer> how about this simple one: A and B take turns adding 1 or 2 tokens to a pile, after B's turn if the pile is divisible by 5 A gets +1 score, if by 7 B gets +1 score
[01:57:17] <droid3> well black wins when either white or itself is in checkmate?
[01:57:29] <rex_victor> yes
[01:57:37] <bildramer> or if you want simultaneous, just make it simultaneous
[01:58:10] <droid3> ya that would be an example of a infinite game that is perfect information and nonzero sum ....rex_victor yes you did it
[01:58:39] *** Joins: Fleck (~fleck@user/fleck)
[01:59:19] <droid3> not very fair game though because black could never lose
[01:59:58] <rex_victor> "white wins when black king is checkmate" and "black wins when white king is checkmate or black king is checkmated by knight"
[02:00:06] <rex_victor> now black can loose :)
[02:01:32] <rex_victor> is there some rule here about reposting a question after a certain time?
[02:02:05] <droid3> ya but is that even nonzero sum anymore rather then just an add degree of handicap for one player
[02:03:04] <rex_victor> According to your definition, if there is a way for both to simultaenously win, it's not zero sum

[02:03:35] <droid3> And the fact that black wins if white or black is in check is kind of a paradoxical game anyway
[02:04:40] <droid3> its kind of lame examples now that i think of about it. As i just choose chess because it you can generalize to infinite game and we already know its a perfect information game that was zero sum.
[02:05:15] <droid3> But again maybe somebody has a better infinite ,nonzero sum , perfect information game out there.
[02:05:24] <droid3> more practical or useful on???
[02:05:30] <rex_victor> that was my thinking; take a zero sum game and skew it
[02:06:18] <droid3> but you still have to make it infinite game with perfect information
[02:06:35] <droid3> so that only 1/3 of the battle
[02:06:46] <rex_victor> yeah but take any infinite game with perfect information and skew it
[02:06:54] <rex_victor> I mean it also works the other way around
[02:07:04] <rex_victor> if you have a non-zero sum game you can even it out

[02:11:49] <PlanckWalk> There are not really any infinite games in practice.
[02:12:10] <PlanckWalk> They're at best approximations to practical games
[02:12:28] <droid3> we also have infinite games that can be grouped into separable games ones that can be written in the form sumij fi(x) gj(y)  which support the minimax theory

[02:14:17] <droid3> Most general infinite games you only have maxmin < minmax even when you try to apply mix strategies because you dont have a pure strategy situation. Aka the minimax theorem doesnt hold for all infinite games.
[02:15:17] <droid3> i had to painstakingly stay up and whiteboard it last night for awhile to prove this fact that minimax does hold for all infinite games. What a hell of a proof though i like it but it was exhausting

[02:48:14] <rex_victor> Z-module: well actually that's the intermediate step to show that L/K is not simple
[02:48:22] <Z-module> normally, the notation  k(...)  means the field of fractions of the polynomial ring  k[...]
[02:48:42] <rex_victor> isn't that the quotient ring?
[02:48:46] <rex_victor> isn't that the quotient field?
[02:48:47] <Z-module> no
[02:49:27] <Z-module> every integral domain embeds in a minimal field, it's field of fractions. It is formed using equivalence classes of formal fractions, exactly as Q is formed from Z

[02:50:08] <rex_victor> ok maybe I'm misunderstanding then what k(...) means
[02:50:16] <Z-module> so you can think of the field of fractions of a domain D as jsut all the formal fractions  d/e   (d, e in D, e nonzero), except subject to   d/e = d'/e'   iff    de' = d'e in D

[02:50:28] <rex_victor> yes that's the standard construction
[02:51:22] <rex_victor> I thought that k(...) means the set of all {f/g with f,g ‚àà k[...]}
[02:51:22] <Z-module> So D = F_2[X] is a domain that is not a field, but F_2(X)  is all the fractions  p(X)/q(X)   (p, q in D, q nonzero), and this is a field now.
[02:51:59] <rex_victor> and F_2(X) is not the quotient field ot F_2[X] ?
[02:52:00] <Z-module> yes, that is a ring extension of k[...] that is a field itself, and that is minimal with that property. It's not a quotient of anything.
[02:52:20] <Z-module> F_2[X] is not even a field
[02:52:24] <Z-module> drop the word quotient here
[02:52:38] <Z-module> X is not invertible in F_2[X]
[02:52:41] <Z-module> it is in F_2(X)
[02:52:47] <Z-module> where its inverse is simply  1/X
[02:53:00] <rex_victor> wait now I'm confused
[02:53:23] <rex_victor> so you're telling me that F_2[X] --> F_2(X) is not the same as Z -> Q ?
[02:53:42] <Z-module> it "is the same", but that's still not a "quotient field"
[02:53:43] *** Joins: rustyy (~rusty@d50-92-229-34.bchsia.telus.net)
[02:53:49] <Z-module> it's a quotient construction in a set-theory sense
[02:53:59] <rex_victor> ah ok so it's a bad translation
[02:54:09] <rex_victor> in German Q is called the quotient field of Z
[02:54:18] <cherim> Field of fractions is the term
[02:54:19] <Z-module> anyway, because of this construction, domains are exactly all the possible subrings of fields
[02:54:36] <rex_victor> Field of fractions, thx cherim :)
[02:54:38] <Z-module> oh I see, "quotient" meaning fraction, now I see, yeah
[02:55:28] <Z-module> typically in algebra in English, a quotient refers to things like quotient groups G/N and quotient rings F[x]/(x^2 + x + 1)  and such things.
[02:56:01] <rex_victor> I see. In German both are called quotients or in case of groups actually factors :)
[02:56:07] <rex_victor> G/N is the factor group :)
[02:56:18] <rex_victor> but quotient group is also used
[02:56:20] <Z-module> (in elementary school math here, we do sometimes call 3/4 a "quotient", but in higher algebra we don't, pretty much)
[02:56:39] <rex_victor> I see. I'll try to keep it straight
[02:57:00] <tolarz> In math, we call it a fracture, but in medicine we don't, pretty much.
[02:57:05] <Z-module> anyway, your problem would be immediately false if the coefficient field weren't F_2, of course
[02:57:17] <Z-module> the unique field having a unique nonzero element!
[02:57:41] <Z-module> heh, tolarz

[03:14:54] <bildramer> but a specific planar embedding of a graph is akin to points (vertices) connected via lines (edges)

[03:16:46] <tolarz> blahboybaz: then try phrasing it as a text.
[03:19:05] <bildramer> think of edge cases and whether or not they count, and what parts of the object are important or not (e.g. you said an x is 5 points, so the middle point "counts", but does it have to? can two lines intersect without that being a point? can lines be curved? do lengths matter? can two points coincide? what properties of the object do you want to study?)

[06:56:16] <fltrz> isekaijin: if you see mathematics as a strictly deductive discipline, you will only learn rammifications of what others have formalized before you
[06:56:43] <isekaijin> Nah, I am not saying that it is a strictly deductive discipline, but one has to have something to work with.
[06:57:09] <fltrz> isekaijin: I could be wrong, but do you have references that distributions and dirac delta functions were around before physicists startded using it?
[06:57:55] <isekaijin> fltrz: I am no historian. I make no claims regarding who came up with distributions first, although I find it very likely that it was physicists.
[06:58:04] <fltrz> isekaijin: sure, and that something can be got by looking how others are doing *something* definitely interesting, but being clumsy at it
[06:58:40] <jmorris> fltrz: do you mean probability distributions?
[06:58:43] <isekaijin> I do not think the use of the [then yet to be formalized] distributions was clumsy at all.

[07:04:40] <isekaijin> At least I think mathematicians should do a better job of separating the parts of math that agree with physical experience, from the parts of math that are purely logical nonsense.

[07:09:28] <[itchyjunk]> Not sure what you have against moving on from this shit.
[07:09:33] <isekaijin> [itchyjunk]: Not just hobby. Engineers and scientists had to slowly develop mathematics, simply because they needed it, and nobody had done it before. Think about people like Archimedes or, later, Newton.
[07:09:47] <[itchyjunk]> isekaijin, a lot of mathematics was hobby math.
[07:10:08] <[itchyjunk]> math as a career is a recent thing.
[07:10:39] <isekaijin> [itchyjunk]: Even Gauss, who is primarily known as a pure mathematician (he worked on number theory, which was then as unapplicable as it gets), sometimes drew inspiration from the physical world. Of course, his work on electromagnetism comes to mind. But also, I think he realized the importance of the concept of Gaussian curvature from doing a land surveying gig, if I recall correctly.
[07:10:42] <mornfall> anything as a career is a recent thing
[07:11:02] <[itchyjunk]> farming as a carrer has been around for 20k years.

[07:14:07] <isekaijin> In any case, back to the original point, I empathize with Poincar√©'s position regarding logic. I mean, logic is cool, but it is offensive that we need logical abominations to justify geometric facts that we can see in the physical world.
[07:14:30] <isekaijin> Logic is, pretty much by definition, the product of our minds. Anything goes, so long as our rules are consistent.

Given the table of substances that are elemental its a lot easier to do chemistry, but start out with unnamed substances (and you don't know which are compound and which are pure) they had to figure out integral coefficients that needed to explain not just
[07:16:34] <fltrz> one reaction but a whole bunch of them. Then every now and then a new reaction appeared that contradicted the older tables, and a whole bunch of coefficients for compounds changed. The phlogiston number was probably correct... ignoring certain classes of reactions

[07:19:52] <isekaijin> [itchyjunk]: Not saying that one has to be interested in the physical world. If you want to do logic, that is totally fine. The problem is when logicians say that *a critical result in real analysis*, which *has consequences for the way we do physics*, ultimately depends on some arbitrarily chosen axiom.
[07:20:31] <mycroftiv> isekaijin: maybe we can find reasons to choose axioms further and further up, the same way we found LEM and choice to strengthen minimal constructivism
[07:21:18] <[itchyjunk]> isekaijin, that sounds more like a problem of reality and less of logicians
[07:21:33] <[itchyjunk]> modern physics is already non intuitive anyways.
[07:21:47] <[itchyjunk]> wanting laws to confer intuition doesn't seem viable
[07:22:24] <mycroftiv> Woodin's work seems to indicate that we can find a 'most canonical' model of how all the ultrafilters that characterize larger and larger infinities line up, and this gives us essentially a higher-order completion of ZFC
[07:22:35] <mycroftiv> in the same way ZFC is like a higher order completion of Peano
[07:23:32] <isekaijin> What do you mean by a ‚Äúhigher-order completion of ZFC‚Äù?
[07:24:32] <isekaijin> I can guess what you mean by ZFC being a higher-order completion of PA. In PA, quantifiers range over natural numbers. In ZFC, quantifiers range over arbitrary sets, which of course include sets of natural numbers, regardless of how you encode natural numbers as sets.
[07:24:37] <mycroftiv> isekaijin: ok Peano arithmetic is like first order, if we go to second order strengthening we get a system much more like set theory https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-order_arithmetic

[07:27:49] <mycroftiv> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_projective_determinacy represents a partial stage along this ladder
[07:29:06] <mycroftiv> well Hugh Woodin and Peter Koellner makes a good case if you care for this stuff. I think there are multiple reasons to think strong logical principles are worth adopting. the algebraic consequences of very strong axioms (laver tables) are really cool
[07:29:26] <mycroftiv> thats the left self distributive algebra and braid theory stuff i like to mention
[07:29:34] <isekaijin> For example, I accept dependent choice, because it allows us to write proofs of the form ‚ÄúConsider this non-deterministic algorithm. We know that it will eventually terminate, but not how and when. If P, then the algorithm does not terminate. Therefore, not P.‚Äù
[07:29:49] <mycroftiv> indeep, its like Weak K√∂nig's Lemma
[07:30:11] <mycroftiv> the Martin Escardo 'seemingly impossible' searches are a fascinating computational application
[07:30:14] <isekaijin> And I accept the axiom of choice, *begrudgingly*, because I need the Nullstellensatz.
[07:30:46] <isekaijin> But I do not see any similar algebraic or geometric case for accepting the continuum hypothesis.
[07:32:29] <mycroftiv> its true in the nicest and simplest models

[14:04:03] <Gurkenglas> A neural network calculates for every input vector a corresponding activation vector of all numbers that are calculated in response somewhere in the network. Call every number slot a neuron. For every subset of neurons ("module") you can project an activation vector down to just the numbers within that module. Given an input distribution I get an activation vector distribution for each module. I can consider two
[14:04:03] <Gurkenglas> module's mutual information. If the input distribution is just a small neighborhood of some input I can tractably consider it. If it isn't I can sample lots of times from the input distribution and then consider its neighborhood, taking the average. This is *sort of* like conditional mutual information where I'm conditioning on the input, but not quite. What am I looking at?

I know that the inner product of each element in an orthonormal list, with each other element in that list, except itself, is zero. But the assignment gives me n + 1 elements, which means I can't just test each element. So I assume there's something I'm missing?
[15:09:39] <Koen> you can test two "representative" elements

[20:02:37] <Z-module> Guest59, yes, it's just the series  4*(1/1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ...)   but with its first term omitted.
[20:03:43] <Guest59> well, we know the series 4/n, what you wrote, is divergent because of the "p-test"

[20:04:05] <Z-module> well, yes, I guess

[20:05:38] <Guest59> but whatever its done
[20:05:42] <Z-module> for any positive real p:    SUM_n  1/n^p   converges iff p > 1.  That's a basic thing you need. Is that what you mean by p-test?

[20:08:43] <Z-module> yes, I corred my "iff" to "only if"

[20:08:53] <Guest59> divergence!
[20:09:13] <Z-module> yes, but really all you needed is that  (1 + 3^n)/2^n  does not -> 0
[20:09:27] <Z-module> which is true purely because all those terms are > 3/2.  You didn't even need that they blow uop.

[21:02:18] <Z-module> isekaijin: well, if |F| = p^n, all of its subrings are subfields (every finite integral domain is a field), and those exist for each order p^d where d | n, and no others.
[21:02:35] <isekaijin> Yes.
[21:02:46] <Z-module> This comes purely from vector space bases.

[21:10:51] <isekaijin> bollu: They are the derived functors of tensor and hom, respectively.

[21:12:29] <Z-module> (it's kind of unfortunate that the word "functor" is so ugly, out loud)
[21:12:34] <isekaijin> Basically, we have the ‚Äúproblem‚Äù that hom and tensor are only exact on one side (left and right, respectively). But, with the derived functors, at least we get a long exact sequence.
[21:13:19] <bollu> isekaijin how do we define exactness in a way that's related to the functor? As far as I can tell, we need to "look inside" the category and talk about kernel and image to be able to define exactness?
[21:13:57] <isekaijin> An additive functor is exact if it sends short exact sequences to short exact sequences.
[21:14:03] <isekaijin> So, for example, localization is exact.

[21:42:08] <isekaijin> bollu: http://mathb.in/67582 -- fixed, now for real
[21:43:06] <isekaijin> To construct Tor and Ext, you need some ideas from homological algebra, mainly chain homotopies, I think.
[21:43:11] <bollu> isekaijin so, like, we now need to show that these Tor exist, right?
[21:43:15] <isekaijin> Yes.
[21:43:21] <bollu> isekaijin is this constructive?
[21:43:29] <isekaijin> rofl not constructive at all
[21:43:41] <isekaijin> Maybe constructive for f.g. or Noetherian modules, though.
[21:43:53] <isekaijin> You replace the module P with a so-called ‚Äúprojective resolution‚Äù.

[21:45:08] <isekaijin> A projective resolution is a chain complex of projective A-modules ‚Äú... -> P_{n+1} -> P_n -> ... -> P_1 -> P_0 -> 0‚Äù that is chain-homotopic to ‚Äú0 -> P -> 0‚Äù.
[21:45:22] <isekaijin> And you need the axiom of choice to show that it exists in general.
[21:45:55] *** Quits: Batzy (~Batzy@user/batzy) (Client Quit)
[21:45:58] <isekaijin> Now, projective A-modules behave much more nicely w.r.t. the tensor product than arbitrary A-modules.
[21:46:28] <isekaijin> In particular, projective modules are flat, so tensoring with a projective module *is* exact.
[21:46:48] *** Joins: Batzy (~Batzy@user/batzy)
[21:47:17] <isekaijin> So to compute Tor_i(M,P), you tensor M with the projective resolution, and then take its homology.
[21:47:50] <isekaijin> To show that this is well-defined, you need to show that Tor_i(M,P) does not depend on the chosen projective resolution of P.
[21:48:10] <Plazma> bollu: just use the axiom of choice like everyone else
[21:48:12] <bollu> why do you need to take homology?
[21:48:23] <isekaijin> That's just the definition of Tor.
[21:49:16] <isekaijin> Okay, to show that Tor does not depend on the chosen projective resolution, you use the fact that any two chain-homotopic chains have the same homology.
[21:49:23] <bollu> right
[21:49:33] <isekaijin> Which is a nice cute exercise in homological algebra that I am too busy to do right now.

[21:52:37] <bollu> isekaijin okay!
[21:52:43] <isekaijin> Ext is constructed similarly, but this time we have to fix the non-right-exactness of Hom, so we use injective resolutions instead of projective ones.
