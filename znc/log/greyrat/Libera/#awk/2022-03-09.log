[20:46:14] <Earnest> tfw realising XSLT is basically awk
[20:50:44] <ccx> That's a far jump. There's a lot of pattern matching and rewriting languages that are much closer. Refal comes to mind, though that has way more sensible matching syntax.
[20:51:13] *** Quits: seninha (~chatzilla@user/seninha) (Quit: ChatZilla 0.9.93 [SeaMonkey 2.53.10.2/20220226204633])
[20:51:54] <ccx> AWK is much closer to SAX in operation if you need to go the XML route here.
[21:00:07] <Earnest> No
[21:00:40] <Earnest> awk is nothing like sax in approach
[21:01:18] <ccx> XSLT does DFS over the structured data for queried pattern, close to how Prolog or the above mentioned Refal work. AWK instead processes records one by one with optional conditional block.
[21:01:19] <Earnest> xslt is like awk because it is predicated on pattern matching and application of some action when a match is found
[21:01:35] <Earnest> I don't care how the input is processed and patterns matched
[21:01:50] <Earnest> awk does it linewise, or based on records, xslt does it based on structure
[21:01:59] *** Joins: seninha (~chatzilla@user/seninha)
[21:02:35] <Earnest> I just wish xsl wasn't so awful to write.  Not that it matters, it's about as dead as can be these days
[21:02:41] <ccx> There's no way, inside some nested AWK function, to query for all lines matching a pattern. Unless you manually store all of them.
[21:03:08] <Earnest> getline
[21:03:21] <Earnest> But this is besides the point, implementation details
[21:04:03] <Earnest> What might be nice is a kind of awk that matches based on css style selectors and provides { some actions and tools to deal with the input }
[21:04:20] <Earnest> rather than the more general regex/record based
[21:05:13] <Earnest> Essentially replacing xpath 
[21:05:45] <ccx> That's not implementation detail. With XSLT all of document is loaded and available for query. With AWK (and SAX) you get a record (or element) at a time and you need to make your own data structures for querying if you need them. It's not implementation detail. It determines how your program needs to be structured and what it can do.
[21:06:02] <Earnest> It's an implementation detail
[21:06:27] <Earnest> The paradigm is still pattern action
[21:07:10] <Earnest> Although this paradigm can be made very blurry if you step far enough back, I wanted to focus on the patterns as DSL and actions
[21:08:20] <Earnest> ccx: To be more like what you're getting at, pyx format and awk could work
[21:08:20] <ccx> It's condition-action and query-template respectively.
[21:09:19] <ccx> If you consider having mutable state vs. no state at all implementation detail I don't know what isn't an implementation detail at that point.
[21:23:16] <ccx> But I'll grant you pattern -> action and query -> transformation are structurally similar and not all too common. The former you often get in simple parsing languages (eg. lex, ragel) and the further you go with allowing backtracking it will start look like a full query (yacc, peg, antlr) though still stopping on first match. And the latter is close siblings with functionally reactive systems, and logic stuff
[21:23:18] <ccx> with forward-chaining like CHR. 
[21:31:58] <ccx> Query -> transformation is also frequent pattern when writing abstract models used among other things for software verification. Linear temporal logic, general transition systems (eg. non-deterministic and/or infinite automata) and all that stuff.
[21:50:26] <Earnest> ccx: Look into 'states' if you haven't ever come across it before, from enscript
[21:56:11] *** Joins: ccl (ccl@user/ccl)
[21:59:56] <ccx> What about it? It definitely falls into the former category; stateful one token at a time processing.
[22:12:22] <Earnest> For interest
[22:29:17] <ccx> It certainly looks interesting. My memory of enscript was that it really struggled with non-latin1 text, I wonder if that applies to this tool too. Though that was probably more of a font issue, it's really been a while since I've touched it.
