[13:28:07] <LittleBunny> My playback for 4K 65 GB x265 video file is choppy with ffplay, is there any thing that I can do to optimize it?
[13:28:49] <LittleBunny> I am using https://github.com/AnimMouse/ffmpeg-autobuild build
[13:30:50] <qu83rt> durandal_1707: here's a couple of videos taken on my phone which show the glitching/tearing https://imgur.com/a/sUmFSMT any idea what causes it and how to fix it?
[13:33:15] <durandal_1707> nothing to do with ffmpeg
[13:33:29] <durandal_1707> you could fix your images to be higher fps
[13:33:43] <durandal_1707> or add some motion blurring
[13:34:38] <qu83rt> I will see if adding more frames fixes it, but I am surprised it happens if that's the case when it's not visible when I scroll through the frames? Is motion blurring something done with ffmpeg or? Sorry for my naivety there..
[13:38:00] <qu83rt> am trying a few things I found through google for motion blurring
[13:41:42] <durandal_1707> you will need to have inputs images in NxFPS framerate where FPS is 30, your final output framerate

[14:50:00] <durandal_1707> for motion blurring, 60 fps is not enough, 600 fps is much better
[14:50:20] <durandal_1707> than you could just do tmix filter to get to 30 fps
[14:50:42] <durandal_1707> assuming you actually do have 600 fps images
[14:50:47] <durandal_1707> and not duplicated ones
[14:51:01] <qu83rt> i can generate however many fps I want the only constraint is how long it takes
[14:51:25] <durandal_1707> qu83rt: with what you generate fps, are frames identical or not?
[14:52:09] <qu83rt> nah it should change every frame as needed, it's running c++ code that calculates the ratio the frames are at and calculates things based on that kind of information
[14:52:27] <durandal_1707> also make sure that other devices output also have tearing
[14:52:51] <durandal_1707> qu83rt: cant you do motion blurring with opencv too?
[14:53:55] <durandal_1707> say in fps of 30 frames per seconds, frame 5 and frame 7 pixel blocks have huge step from one place to another

[18:51:15] <thebombzen> how can I do this, so it discards any invalid h264 video before the next I-frame and also any audio that overlaps with the invalid video?
[18:51:15] <a1rwulf> hey,
[18:51:15] <a1rwulf> Is there a way to use nvdec without necessarily knowing which codec it is?
[18:51:15] <a1rwulf> I want to do livetv transcoding therefore don't know if the inputstream is mpeg2/h264/h265, but I still would like to make sure it's using nvdec and nvenc to transcode.
[18:51:57] <thebombzen> a1rwulf: livetv? is it UHD or just 1080p (or lower)
[18:52:00] *** Parts: stdInOut (~stdInOut@user/stdInOut) (Leaving)
[18:52:06] <thebombzen> because if it's only 1080p or lower you're probably better off simply using a software decoder
[18:52:41] <a1rwulf> I expect mostly 1080 and lower
[18:53:48] <thebombzen> then you're probably better off doing software decoding
[18:54:06] <thebombzen> especially if you're using nvenc for encoding
[18:54:45] <a1rwulf> ok interesting
[18:55:04] <thebombzen> especially if it's H.264 or lower
[18:55:21] <thebombzen> which is not particularly complex computationally relative to HEVC or AV1

[22:15:42] <thebombzen> yes, because it's faster
[22:15:59] <thebombzen> if you're doing HW encode then in theory you can but it's very hard to do that with ffmpeg.c if you aren't sure what codec you are getting

[22:26:07] <znf> a1rwulf, if it's SD from DVB-T/C, it's most likely mpeg2
[22:26:16] <znf> if it's HD, then it's most likely mpeg4
[22:26:32] <furq> h264
[22:26:36] <znf> yes
[22:26:47] <znf> it's it's 4K, then it's HEVC
[22:26:54] <furq> a lot of countries are using hevc for hd dvb
[22:27:30] <znf> which? and how? that would throw off all TVs that don't directly support HEVC
[22:27:59] <znf> and would most likely require a STB for the client
[22:28:04] <furq> at least nl, cz and hr
[22:28:33] <znf> is this over dvb-c/t?
[22:28:35] <kepstin> would they be doing a subchannel thing with a simultaneous non-4k broadcast in h.264?
[22:28:37] <furq> dvb-t2
[22:28:54] <kepstin> (or some other older code?)
[22:29:09] <znf> What would they gain out of simultaneously doing h264?
[22:29:41] <furq> compat but i don't think they do
[22:29:48] <furq> i think you just need a discrete stb or a new tv
[22:29:58] <znf> yeah, but at that point why would you do hevc?
[22:30:14] <furq> because you only did your dvb-t2 rollout in 2019 and the mpeg-la guys got to you
[22:30:24] <furq> at least that's my assumption i don't live in any of those countries
[22:30:56] <znf> Sounds kinda like a silly business decision - you can broadcast over DVB-T2, but only people with new TVs will be able to receive your channel
[22:31:03] <furq> i'm just going off wikipedia and what one czech guy i know said
[22:31:05] <znf> unless they invest in a new box
[22:31:18] <furq> it's not exactly novel to need a discrete stb anyway
[22:31:27] <furq> most people needed one here when we did our dvb-t2 rollout using avc
[22:31:28] <znf> for DVB-T/2 ?
[22:31:29] <znf> :-/
[22:31:30] <znf> hm
[22:31:43] <furq> obviously all tvs made since then have it built in
[22:32:09] <znf> Haven't ever used DVB-T myself
[22:32:31] <minimal> znf: Ireland rolled out DVB-T2 a couple of years ago when they switched off analogue broadcasts, so everyone in Northern Ireland in border areas suddenly needed a DVB-T2 box to watch Irish TV (as well as UK TV which is DVB-T)
[22:33:06] <znf> what codecs?
[22:33:22] <minimal> H.264 only in Ireland AFAIK
[22:33:51] <minimal> whereas in UK, which is DVB-T, they use MPEG2 for SD and H.264 for HD AFAIK
[22:33:55] <furq> yeah
[22:33:58] <znf> that's what I consider normal
[22:34:05] <znf> mpeg2 for sd, h264 for hd, and hevc for 4k
[22:34:19] <znf> but I find it weird to use hevc for hd
[22:34:23] <furq> is anywhere actually doing 4k over dvb
[22:34:29] <furq> i know it's technically possible but idk if it exists in the wild
[22:34:32] <minimal> don't think either Ireland or UK do 4k via DVB-T
[22:34:47] <minimal> assume UK do it via DVB-S2

[22:37:57] <znf> nothing alike US pays
[22:38:20] <znf> I actually have no idea how much a standard cable subscription is
[22:38:45] <znf> my provider says 30 RON/mo, so that's about 6€/mo for basic (no hbo, extras etc.)
[22:39:55] <znf> 1€ extra for 4K, ~3€ extra for HBO "Maxpack" whatever the hell that is, and 0.25€ extra or "Adult"
[22:43:39] <a1rwulf> thebombzen: I see, yeah I might have to roll my own frontend, not sure yet.
[22:43:39] <a1rwulf> I'd like to scale for a pretty large amount of simultaneous streams (as in 20-30), but I need to test when I hit my cpu limit in that case.
[22:43:42] <kepstin> I'd expect that in most cases in north america you'd be looking at $15-25 for basic cable, which might not include the rental fees for the required stb (add maybe $5-15 or so?)
