[12:42:00] <Reinhilde> "that person doesn't look trans" is kinda insensitive. There's no one trans appearance, and I personally find myself internally "clocking" people at a far higher rate than I think there are actually trans people. Most of us look completely normal by assigned-gender standards before transition
[12:46:17] <Reinhilde> also, actions speak louder than straplines, so the trans army mobbing you and adding you to terfblocker despite saying you're pro-trans could be completely understandable. I personally don't like cancelmobs because they disproportionately affect marginalized people like us (one trans woman author got cancelmobbed and ultimately detransitioned because of it, chancing negative mental health
[12:46:19] <Reinhilde> outcomes of detransition. Her name was Isabel Fall), so I'm hesitant to say you chanced it.
[12:46:50] <Reinhilde> because that would be blaming the victim of a hate attack.
[12:49:25] <SirSceptalot> "there's no one trans appearance" - while that may be true, there are plenty of trans appearances. Or a scale/gradient of it, if you prefer that.
[12:49:37] <Reinhilde> oh stuff off sceptalot
[12:49:52] <Reinhilde> very few people are truly deserving victims of a full cancelmob. Most of them are rich and powerful, and their cancellation will just garner them a prime-time TV slot, making it toothless.
[12:50:02] <SirSceptalot> I have no idea what cancelmob is
[12:50:44] <Reinhilde> A cancelmob is when a large community of people are typically autonomously whipped up into saying someone is "cancelled."

[12:52:50] <Reinhilde> Generally cancelling someone admonishes your audience to cease contact with them

[12:54:34] <Reinhilde> i've to put on a full face helmet to view his microblogs
[12:55:59] <Reinhilde> it's generally ok to cancel elites but it lacks any significant force
[12:58:02] <sd> 14<X‚ÄãeLaD> This is probably a topic for the Politics channel but - Imo cancelling people is dumb, Johnny Depp is one of the more recent proofs of this
[12:58:35] <sd> 14<X‚ÄãeLaD> and taking away peoples voice because their opinion differs from yours just puts you inside a bubble
[12:59:44] <Reinhilde> cancelmobs tend to be whipped up when a shit opinion becomes a form of stochastic violence (such as the Rowling row a few years ago)
[13:02:58] <Reinhilde> And i'm not saying cancelmobs are good. They can serve to isolate the cancellee deeper into the echo chamber/high control situation they ventured out of and got cancelled
[13:04:44] <Reinhilde> but if you're trying to rally the Anti-Cancel Aktion troops, it helps to know the battlefield, including where the enemy is right
[13:05:12] <Reinhilde> of course, yeah, this is hyperpolitical as discussions go

[15:52:42] <sd> 02<H‚Äãunterkll> oh, so you're doing the JEA config and whoever's logging in has issues?
[15:52:46] <pcspkr> it autocreates the ad psdrive and tries to discover a dc
[15:53:11] <pcspkr> this shit is ungoogleable too
[15:53:18] <sd> 02<H‚Äãunterkll> so user loads ps modules -> attempts to do shit -> no good
[15:53:21] <pcspkr> I only vaguely remember there are some funky env vars you can set
[15:53:53] <pcspkr> no, the user connects to a jea powershell configuration, a powershell module gets autoloaded that imports the activedirectory module
[15:54:28] <sd> 02<H‚Äãunterkll> hum.... this is one of those things, but ...
[15:54:55] <pcspkr> but the ultimate question is simple

[15:55:08] <sd> 02<H‚Äãunterkll> that *should* make it work

[15:55:25] <pcspkr> sites are set up fine
[15:55:26] <sd> 02<H‚Äãunterkll> easy answer is no
[15:55:36] <sd> 02<H‚Äãunterkll> should use S&S to find the right DC

[15:59:03] <sd> 02<H‚Äãunterkll> oh?

[17:44:08] <sintax> lol
[17:44:21] <Jaelae> verizon ran fios fiber to our state all over and got a lot of funding for that. i think they only had to do X households then they stopped 2 towns away from me

[17:45:49] <Kiernian> Yes it is :D
[17:45:51] <Jaelae> not on my home internet
[17:46:03] <sintax> plus the upload is nice for my backups.
[17:46:17] <Jaelae> though our cable provider is running fiber to compete with the others and it has 1Gbps fiber. so maybe one day
[17:46:20] <Jaelae> yea the upload is the killer there
[17:46:41] <sintax> just nice not having to wait forever for something.

[17:59:28] <PublicWiFi> yeah that's the idea
[17:59:35] <PublicWiFi> I'm thinking 1k per month at first and ramping it up
[17:59:40] <PublicWiFi> dropping 24k a year extra sounds rough xD
[17:59:55] <PublicWiFi> our income is roughly 100k together so its possible to do I guess lol
[17:59:57] <sintax> What else you going to do with your money?
[18:00:02] <PublicWiFi> invest
[18:00:04] <sintax> pfft
[18:00:15] <sintax> Id do 1,000 on the house and invest another 1000 a month
[18:00:21] <PublicWiFi> Yeah maybe that's teh route
[18:00:28] <sintax> that way if something were to happen you'd have access to that money
[18:00:37] <PublicWiFi> I'm thinking even doing like 250 per month on something risky like crypt
[18:00:39] <PublicWiFi> crypto
[18:00:55] <PublicWiFi> we have a... sizeable nest egg though so savings isn't at issue
[18:01:00] <sintax> i don't know if I'd do that with crypto
[18:01:05] <PublicWiFi> we can do ruoghly 12 months without either of us working

[18:01:27] <PublicWiFi> yeah for sure
[18:01:30] <sintax> i could do 12 hours without working :)

[18:04:57] <PublicWiFi> BUT i found this old ass 28k fax modem in a drawer on friday LOL, serial interface

[18:05:34] <PublicWiFi> the fax standard hasn't changed in 20 years right? :P
[18:05:47] <sintax> probably longer than that lol
[18:05:54] <PublicWiFi> I bet I can still get this to work
[18:06:04] <CptLuxx> should just work..
[18:06:04] <sintax> we needed a filter on some lines since they're VOIP to get it work but some worked without. 
[18:06:07] <PublicWiFi> so I don't have to wait for my modem card

[18:07:31] <CptLuxx> yes
[18:07:37] <CptLuxx> works since.. 6 years?

[20:54:03] <sloth_on_meth> Lmao
[20:56:33] <CoJaBo> PublicWiFi: If they want to try to argue why we would have changed their nameservers from our own to the specific competing service provider the client chose out of spite, that would make for an amusing case
[20:57:15] <CoJaBo> I'm assuming some web dev they hired asked for that info, but didn't know what email is
[20:57:28] <CoJaBo> This happens a lot, which is why we have a waiver lol

[22:44:06] <sudoRoot> Haven't tried it, but something like this is one way you could do it: Get-Eventlog -LogName Security -ComputerName $ComputerName | where {$_.eventID -eq 4624 }}
[22:44:27] <sudoRoot> run that against your computers. 
[22:46:51] <sudoRoot> That requires them to be powered on though. I'd probably just create a logon script that appends login info to a csv per machine. have the script save the log on a file share for you to access. I do something similar for getting computer specs, installed apps, and windows license info
