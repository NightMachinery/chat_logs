[00:19:04] <mats1> how can you possibly build an accurate actuarial assessment when a biz incorporates many hundreds of millions or billions lines of code ?
[00:19:32] <mats1> little wonder theyre bleeding money far in excess of premiums
[00:20:43] <TimMc> Well, that's up to the insurer to figure out.
[00:22:08] <TimMc> e.g. the policy could be made to only cover explicitly listed data or systems, and each one could be assessed for value of availability and quality of practices
[00:23:01] <TimMc> The insurer could also offer "and anything not listed" just-in-case coverage if they're sufficiently impressed with how well the business manages its assets.
[00:23:17] <TimMc> but probably you'd want to avoid that :-)
[00:25:25] <mats1> a real elaborate mousetrap

[02:34:11] <mats1> they're bullshitting about 'credentials', to exploit teh bug, you plug in PII
[02:34:14] <TimMc> What would you call the "bug", though? Lack of password quality assessments?
[02:34:45] <mats1> relatedly, try plugging in a license plate or vin, on carmax, carvana, vroom, etc
[02:34:54] <TimMc> Oh, this isn't passwords, but like... name, birthdate, address?
[02:36:30] <TimMc> Neat, I can get the VIN, year, make, and model from a license plate. 🤔

[02:37:42] <mats1> or ~5tb worth of db dumps from raidforums

[03:22:09] <circuitbone> If you gotta ask, you aint up to the task...
[03:23:06] <mats1> there's #hackrf and #ubertooth which is bridged to discord, or you could go to the gsg discord at discord.gg/WpGnBvVY
[03:23:31] <mats1> (great scott gadgets, e.g. https://greatscottgadgets.com/hackrf/one/ )
[03:24:12] <godSend23> oh wow thank u!! mats1, would u say IRC and discord are developing a more closer relationship?

[03:43:24] <shibboleth> oh, it's america classic
[03:43:26] <TimMc> shibboleth: Social bookmarking website.
[03:43:30] <shibboleth> started with the war of 1812
[03:43:50] <mats1> https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/apr/04/argo-new-zealand-diplomat-diary related luls
[03:43:58] <shibboleth> which the us thinks it won, "canada" actually won, and the brits soon forgot all about
[03:44:02] <TimMc> shibboleth: It really popularized the concept of tagging and folksonomies.
[03:44:44] <shibboleth> TimMc, so basically "notepad cloud edition"?
[03:44:46] <TimMc> Then it got bought like 4 times and finally Maciej, owner of underdog competitor Pinboard, bought it and laughed and laughed and laughed.
[03:47:02] <TimMc> shibboleth: Not really. You get a personal database of URL, title, tags, description records and can make them public or not.
[03:47:12] *** Joins: mnemonic (~semeion@user/semeion)
[03:47:32] <TimMc> That gets sliced several ways: 1) See all of someone's bookmarks; 2) search for bookmarks by tag; 3) see a tag cloud for a given URL
[03:48:00] <TimMc> pinboard.in has basically the same features, so you can see some examples on this random user page: https://pinboard.in/u:jeffmreyes/
[03:48:23] <shibboleth> TimMc, yeah...
[03:48:26] <TimMc> It seemed like a great idea at the time, but bookmarks are *super* fragile, so I switched to archiving and tagging everything locally.

[03:49:24] <TimMc> with search/filtering, sure
[03:49:35] <TimMc> So you could e.g. subscribe to a feed of popular URLs with certain tags.
[03:50:01] <TimMc> That part was actually pretty useful and still would be.
[03:50:52] <shibboleth> could you... sit in a cirkle and sing kumbayah?
[03:51:10] <TimMc> I do not believe it had that feature, no.

[09:36:13] <Guest29> My VPN ROuter is stable, never disconnected
[09:36:25] <Guest29> Both are raspberry Pi 4Bs
[09:36:27] <catbeard> probably lost the circuit
[09:36:30] <catbeard> oh
[09:36:36] <catbeard> free -mt
[09:36:36] <Guest29> But why would my WIFI disconnect
[09:36:40] <catbeard> ont he pi
[09:36:41] <Guest29> 4 gigs ram
[09:36:58] <catbeard> is it doing dhcp/dns pihole?
[09:37:08] <Guest29> I can understand Wifi staying connected and lagging, or losing internet connection for a few seconds while circuit switches
[09:37:17] <Guest29> But the WIFi connection from my laptop to the Tor Router disconnects
[09:37:27] <catbeard> does the wifi connection from anything else disconnect?
[09:37:28] <Guest29> not sure if its Lubuntu OS issue, or Tor Router causing it
[09:37:37] <Guest29> But i think circuit switching shouldnt cause wifi to disconnect
[09:37:42] <Guest29> no, just when I connect to the Tor Router
[09:37:51] <Guest29> It may be my OS

[09:38:28] <Guest29> I should check why my laptop losses connection
[09:38:42] <Guest29> is my OS glitching? or the Tor router
[09:38:44] <Guest29> that is the question
[09:39:15] <catbeard> are you logging the tor daemon status, does it say anything when wifi disconnects? or i guess after when you reconnect to check the logs?

[09:41:54] <Guest0> I think my computer was randomly trying to connect to a non-existent past ethernet connection

[09:43:22] <Guest0> honestly
[09:43:31] <Guest0> Using so much anonymity might actually increase the NSAs surveillience of me
[09:43:40] <Guest0> Most people just use 1 VPN hop, maybe 2 hops, and then Tor
[09:43:50] <Guest0> Im using double, almost triple the normal level of anonymity services
[09:43:57] <catbeard> why
[09:44:01] <Guest0> Might make 'Them' focus on my traffic even more

[09:44:41] <dconklin> Security through obscurity
[09:45:06] <catbeard> security through good fucking lucking separating my traffic from these other 20,000 people
[09:45:12] <Guest0> On the one hand, using so many hops will probably make my connection harder to track
[09:45:22] <Guest0> Literally 10 layers of encryption
[09:45:28] <Guest0> as the data leaves my house
[09:45:31] <Guest0> Thats pretty awesome

[09:45:46] <dconklin> True, wish I knew how to set that up LOL

[14:12:31] <faceface> shad: I've seen some models support that and some dont... I have a laptop bag with a single USB port, and I was wondering if I could alternatively attach it to a charger to charge up a powerbank / phone to use the powerbank ... What confuses things is that the phone will actually supply power if connected, so I don't know how it would be negotiated
