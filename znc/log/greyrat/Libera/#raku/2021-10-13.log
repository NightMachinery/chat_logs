[01:58:21] <joeyxl> not to bad just hanging out. reading about raku
[01:58:25] <pony> nice
[01:58:35] <joeyxl> thinking learning it as my first programming language
[01:58:41] <pony> yay
[01:59:20] <joeyxl> do you like it? 
[01:59:27] <pony> yeah :)
[02:00:13] <joeyxl> cool :)
[02:00:37] <joeyxl> is it good language to start with?
[02:00:50] <joeyxl> or am i getting myself into somthing advanced?
[02:02:40] <pony> shouldn't be a problem, nah
[02:02:52] <pony> I don't think picking a first language matters as much as people think

[10:35:17] <moon-child> because:   multi sub infix:<->($x = 0) { $x.Numeric }
[10:36:21] <gfldex> &[-] defaults to infix by design
[10:36:38] <moon-child> yes.  The question is, why does infix - with one param not negate?
[10:36:51] <moon-child> and given it does not, why does infix ~ with one param stringify?
[10:38:19] <gfldex> Because, no matter the multicandidate, operators coerce and guarantee to return a specific type.
[10:39:42] <moon-child> neither &infix:<->'s proto nor &infix:<~>'s guarantee a specific return type; so it is purely conventional
[10:40:19] <gfldex> Roast demands them to.
[10:41:22] <moon-child> that's fine, but I want to know why?
[10:41:31] <moon-child> (also about the discrepancy between the map results)
[10:42:42] <gfldex> Because Larry said so, basically. It is a fundamental design principle not to confuse humans with overloading the same operator over and over again.
[10:43:06] <gfldex> If you see `~`, you know you gonna get a Str.
[10:43:24] <moon-child> I mean, why does &[-](5) != -5?
[10:44:21] <gfldex> Becaue [stuff] is a reduction operator and those are defined to take an infix as a function argument.
[10:44:49] <moon-child> yes, the question is why does &infix:<-> not negate when called with one parameter?
[10:45:06] <gfldex> Thus, even with higher order operator programming, you know what you gonna get.

[14:28:01] <mfiano> say applying a variable only known at runtime to the - operator
[14:30:58] <moritz_> -$foo also uses the prefix operator
[14:31:44] <mfiano> Ok, makes sense.

[14:32:08] <mfiano> Sorry for the dumb questions. Coming from Lisp and this is all new to me.
[14:32:15] <moritz_> the infix operator is, by its nature, a binary operator -- it always stands between two terms
[14:32:17] <mfiano> Thanks :)
[14:32:39] <moritz_> so if the operator is associative, it's easy to come up with a sensible degenerate case for just one argument
[14:33:12] <moritz_> but both - and / are not associative (so  a - (b - c) and (a - b) - c) are not the same), so such a reduction doesn't follow automatically
[14:33:17] <moritz_> you're welcome

[19:30:07] <melezhik> so that users would quickly share their opinions on the new version, you don't even have to go long way of creating a new post on any social media ... just a thought ...
