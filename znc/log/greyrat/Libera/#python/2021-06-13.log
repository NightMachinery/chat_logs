[01:28:04] <bjs> leitz: these `from person import Character` and `from character import Character` lines are confused between person/ and person/person.py
[01:28:25] *** Quits: gloomy (~ldorigo@213.237.93.240) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[01:28:36] <bjs> because `person` is the name of the package, not the sub-module
[01:28:43] <bjs> in those contexts
[01:29:23] <bjs> leitz: the easiest way to make this work is to add `from .person import Person; from .character import Character` into person/__init__.py  then you can `from person import Person` from the package "person" directly.

[01:30:03] <bjs> leitz: you'll have to delete the sys.path entry that points *inside* the person/ package because that's what's really causing the confusion here

[01:31:09] <leitz> bjs, correct. That update to __init__.py was your suggestion.   ;)(
[01:31:12] <bjs> leitz: right but the way you have it setup at the moment isn't right and it only "happens" to work for one case.  You've got muddled up between the package and the sub-module so much that one path just happens to work :)
[01:31:48] <bjs> leitz: good!  try delete the sys.path hackery

[01:33:16] <bjs> leitz: I still see some `from character import Character` stuff in there in places,  this needs to be fixed too (to be `from .character import Character` or `from person import Character`). Or really really you should give different names to the top-level package as the sub-modules so it's easier to disambiguate
[01:34:43] <leitz> bjs, I'm up for renaming the top-level package, once I figure out how to make this work.
[01:35:13] <leitz> bjs, running it with "python3 -m" works. How do I make it run as its own command?

[01:37:06] <bjs> leitz: the way "real" python programs make this work is by installing packages so you can import them from anywhere by just the name of the package.
[01:37:19] <bjs> leitz: it is a package. a "package" is a python directory with an __init__.py in it

[01:38:40] <leitz> bjs, the (currently poorly named) "person/" directory is the package, then.
[01:38:53] <bjs> leitz: if you execute the file directly like that (which is the same as running `python3 path/to/file.py`) then python doesn't know where the other packages are or how to find them
[01:39:10] <bjs> leitz: your sys.path stuff was a hack to "fix" this, but it did it badly.
[01:40:14] <bjs> leitz: you could do something like sys.path.append(str(pathlib.Path(__file__).parent.parent)) to put the directory that contains the person/ package into the path but this is just another hack and also fails in some cases. its' why we have tools like `pip` that know how to do this correctly.

[01:48:09] <leitz> bjs, that's part of the gap from "just starting" to "pip, etc". I have to have OS based python packages because of the OS. I haven't gotten into compiling python because this OS is pretty current. And I prefer to stay with the standard library.

[01:58:23] <bjs> leitz: it's sad but over time people have made third-party tools to try make packaging easier, and then they built tools on those tools and so on.  now we have something like venv

[01:59:36] <leitz> which is not to say sys.path.append is better.    :(
[02:00:13] <habnabit_> leitz, ime the only people who push back against venv are people who are used to their preferred language doing something slightly different. people new to programming accept it as "ah, this is just how programming works"
[02:00:52] <leitz> habnabit_, or us who come from systems backgrounds where having to build a virtual environment is a high cost for a simple project.
[02:01:33] <habnabit_> leitz, sure. some people are confused by the idea of a 'virtual environment' in python being small and disposable/ephemeral
[02:01:36] <bjs> leitz: tbh venvs aren't that big an investment (maybe 10kB for the actual venv + libraries) and then once you're done you can just delete it
[02:01:45] <bjs> it's not a big deal
[02:01:49] <habnabit_> leitz, because, well, they are. there's no 'high cost'
[02:02:38] <InPhase> bjs: The cost is needing to constantly readd a bunch of packages when you're almost always drawing from the same set of common use ones.
[02:02:56] <habnabit_> luckily, pip has a cache for that
[02:03:04] <leitz> habnabit_, I'm not confused. I am well aware of the cost of building develoment environments. If I disagree with you, please don't think I'm stupid.
[02:03:29] <bjs> leitz: wait no I'm wrong,  apparently a fresh 3.9 venv is 12MiB on my system

[02:16:25] <bjs> leitz: venv bundles everything you need to make it work together, I really recommend just learning how to make it work for you and then using it to do things
[02:16:54] <bjs> leitz: pyenv is good too (to get different versions of Python installed on the same machine,  even if I only want 1 version I use it anyway so I don't have to touch the system packages)
[02:17:01] <bjs> just unfortunately named
[02:17:07] <leitz> bjs, I'd rather figure out how to write the code without needing venv.
[02:17:52] <bjs> leitz: venv lets you write code the way you want to write code.  If you want to write code without venv you're going to either (1) re-invent venv but worse, or (2) have to write code in a particular way that makes Python happy
[02:18:14] <bjs> that means using -m and being very strict about what directories things are in
[02:21:43] <leitz> bjs, ah, a funny moment. I just copied the failing program to the repository root (sibling to the 'person/' directory), and it works. You or habnabit_ mentioned that beforeI I think.

[05:18:19] <mefistofeles> and yeah it can be a pain, but what tool isn't xD specially when it has to deal with so many different packages and complexity. As a rule of thumb I try to avoid mixing channels in the same venv, that has worked fine for me with conda.
[05:18:44] <ablegreen> yeah but what if your other software that you want to use a conda library already uses virtual env, not conda env
[05:18:54] <foo>   (unknown error: DevToolsActivePort file doesn't exist)
[05:18:54] <foo>   (The process started from chrome location /usr/bin/chromium-browser is no longer running, so ChromeDriver is assuming that Chrome has crashed.)

[06:47:29] <wgwz> habnabit_: ok, that's unfortunate
[06:48:06] <habnabit_> wgwz, i don't think so, really. you can set that pip option in a config file that's read per-user or per-venv if you want
[06:48:33] *** Skyz29 is now known as skyz
[06:48:55] <wgwz> habnabit_: the per-venv sounds like it could work, have a link/ref available for what you have in mind?

[07:01:30] <wgwz> i think i miscommunicated my intent habnabit_. i was not intending to ship anything about index urls in the package. rather i wanted to specify that when setting up a particular application for development or deployment, you'll need to grab a package from a particular custom pypi. and i was hoping there could have been a way to do that after creating a virtualenv, and installing the app `pip
[07:01:32] <wgwz> install -e .[dev]`. anyways, thanks for the help

[07:04:40] <habnabit_> wgwz, basically there's no way to 'tell' this to pip without the user doing something manually, whether that's adding the flag when running pip or adding a pip.conf file somewhere

[07:06:28] <wgwz> the thing is i'm being picky... i've got a fine solution for my case. because i was already using docker. but suppose that i wasn't using docker
[07:07:09] <wgwz> i want to be able to clone my repo, and kick off development without having to set up the extra index url in my pip.conf
[07:07:09] <habnabit_> wgwz, well, the first question would be "why can't you post these packages to pypi"

[07:07:51] <wgwz> because it's private stuff that i don't want to share publically (yet)
[07:08:13] <habnabit_> wgwz, then who's installing this? ;)
[07:09:27] <wgwz> it's always me but i want to be lazy! i don't want to have to remember the pip.conf.. but ultimately i could just write a bash script that provisions my virtualenv and copies a pip.conf into it. i just wish i could be even lazier..
[07:10:24] <habnabit_> wgwz, i think poetry has some support for this

[14:41:45] <habnabit_> rendar, ^ is part of the | & ^ family of operator precedence; `and`/`or` have different precedence. this is because of the former category always uses both operands and the latter category is lazy

[14:44:03] <ssbr> habnabit_: & and | are lower precedence than ==, despite the general rule that "bool things come after non-bool things in the precedence table", because & and | predate && and ||.
[14:44:26] <nedbat> rendar: the C equivalent of your question is: "why do I have && and &, and || and |, but only ^"
[14:44:30] <habnabit_> rendar, C doesn't have logical xor
[14:44:43] <habnabit_> rendar, what would 'logical xor' even mean?
[14:44:44] <ssbr> habnabit_: (the precedence table was designed to support "a == b || b == c" kind of things, even before && and || existed)
[14:44:46] <KirkMcDonald> C has != just as Python does.

[14:46:02] <ssbr> but yes, that's how I'd write it -- bool(x) != bool(y)
[14:46:09] <rendar> yeah
[14:46:18] <habnabit_> ^ doesn't treat the operands as a boolean and return a boolean
[14:46:19] <rendar> basically the logical ^ is !=
[14:46:22] <habnabit_> so.. what's logical about t?

[15:07:21] <ssbr> multidimensional indexing is just tuples, it's the slicing that needs special syntax support

[15:11:07] <bjs> habnabit_: it's hard because you don't know what the syntax is before you start parsing
[15:11:28] <nedbat> habnabit_: the problem is compiling code without reading the libraries it imports, right?
[15:11:30] <bjs> also the fact that operators are sort of defined at runtime due to the way imports work

Then if you want to do it nicely you want to allow libraries to define-and-export new operators.

[15:30:34] <bjs> habnabit_: i think the way GHC works is that it parses all operators with some fixed associativity and precedence, then looks at all the infix[r|l] declarations in the soup of definitions and then re-writes the tree after the fact but I'm not entirely sure
[15:30:56] <bjs> Python's parser is currently quite nice and the precedence and associativity is just baked into the grammar

[22:08:10] <ezzieyguywuf> the os module is so big, I have a hard time finding my way around the docs - which function is the one I would use to move a file?
[22:09:13] <grawity> probably shutil.move()
[22:09:30] <ezzieyguywuf> grawity: ah. or os.replace it seems
[22:09:31] <grawity> the os module has os.rename(), but it (like the corresponding OS call) only works within the same filesystem
[22:09:36] <nedbat> ezzieyguywuf:  https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#shutil.move can do more
[22:09:37] <SnoopJ> ezzieyguywuf, os.rename(), but I would use shutil.move() as well here
