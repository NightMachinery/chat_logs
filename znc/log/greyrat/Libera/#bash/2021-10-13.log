[01:15:13] <euouae> rg here stands for grep -r -l
[01:15:20] <twkm> dangerous.
[01:15:27] <euouae> Why?
[01:15:38] <twkm> whitespace in filenames will break it.

[01:15:53] *** Joins: Crescendo (~Crescendo@user/crescendo)
[01:16:15] <twkm> then you probably need to review how for works.
[01:16:33] <neshpion> `rg -l Foo` can return a filename with whitespace, which will be word-split for f into mulitple items
[01:16:52] <GuiToris> geirha, does printf escape space? https://bpa.st/raw/IEPA The output is -metadata foo\ bar

[01:17:27] <twkm> yes, if you use %q instead of %s.
[01:17:31] <neshpion> also backticks are archaic and $() is preferred.  but to address the word-splitting issue, you should populate an array and then iterate over that:  mapfile -t files < <(rg -l Foo); for f in "${files[@]}"; do ...; done
[01:17:58] <twkm> !check for f in `rg -l Foo`; do sed 's/Foo/Bar/g' < "$f" > "$f.tmp" && mv "$f.tmp" "$f"; done

[01:19:13] <euouae> True! Can it be done in-place?
[01:19:32] <GuiToris> twkm, that's it, thank you. How could I single quote the variable? I mean I'd like the output to be -metadata 'foo bar'. But if I wrote '$var' it just wouldn't work

[01:19:47] <euouae> Looks like sed can do it in-place from the man page. Nice
[01:20:17] <geirha> GuiToris: foo\ bar  and  'foo bar'  is exactly the same. %q just chooses to use the former
[01:20:18] <neshpion> from what i recall, sed basically creates a temp file and then overwrites the original, so it's not "true" in-place editing, or something like that
[01:20:19] <twkm> "$var" should be fine GuiToris.  or is the being sent to a subshell/remote?
[01:20:33] <euouae> neshpion ok but probably is careful enough about permissions right?
[01:20:34] <neshpion> sed -i, i mean
[01:20:44] <neshpion> euouae: maybe, i don't know, i suppose it's fine to try it

[01:27:57] <twkm> so "foo bar" and 'foo bar' and foo\ bar are all the same, please mrz bash don't word split this data, keep it a single "word" (argument).
[01:28:32] <euouae> what's mrz?
[01:28:36] <twkm> but only "$var" allows $var to be replaced by var's value and the result kept a single word.

[09:31:22] <eoli3n_> why the first "dict" doesnt work as one ?
[09:32:04] <geirha> the first "dict" is an indexed array, not an associative array
[09:33:13] <geirha> # one=1 two=2 three=42 tab=( ['one']="salut" ['two']="coucou" ['three']="bonjour" ) ; declare -p tab
[09:33:14] <shbot> geirha: declare -a tab=([1]="salut" [2]="coucou" [42]="bonjour")
[09:34:18] <geirha> since tab was not declared as an associative array, and you used array syntax, it becomes an indexed array, and all the [subscript]s are treated as arithmetic contexts

[09:35:11] <eoli3n_> so shouldn't echo ${!tab1[@]} give me indexes ? (it does not)
[09:35:28] <eoli3n_> oups, that's tab, not tab1
[09:35:34] <eoli3n_> it gives me "O" only
[09:35:36] <geirha> it'll only have 0
[09:36:04] *** Quits: af (~af@awalgarg.me) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[09:36:16] <eoli3n_> so if I need an associated array, i need to use declare -A in any cases
[09:36:16] <geirha> because one, two and three are unset variables, so ['one']="salut" becomes [0]=salut and ['two']="coucou" becomes [0]=coucou
[09:36:33] <eoli3n_> ok, got it, thanks
[09:36:35] <geirha> yes
[09:37:07] <geirha> in my example, I gave one two and three values, so the indices ended up as 1 2 and 42

[09:37:30] <shbot> geirha: 1 2 42
[09:37:31] <eoli3n_> yes, now its clear
[09:38:11] <eoli3n_> the strange part is simple quotes
[09:38:15] <eoli3n_> 'one'
[09:40:22] <geirha> 'one' \o\n\e "one" and one  is the same string after the quote removal parsing step has been run
[09:40:25] <eoli3n_> why is that substituted by values in vars ? i guess that its specific to array syntax ?
[09:40:51] <eoli3n_> hm ok
[09:40:58] <geirha> # var=21; echo "$(( var + var ))"
[09:40:59] <shbot> geirha: 42
[09:41:30] <geirha> !math

[09:44:37] <geirha> the [subscript] of an indexed array is arithmetic context, with same rules as in $(( ))
[09:44:48] <eoli3n_> oh ok
[09:45:23] <eoli3n_> yep, shellcheck explained me that (( n+1 )) doesn't need "$"
[09:45:31] <geirha> quotes in bash are not used to separate string literals from other stuff, like in many general purpose languages
[09:45:34] <eoli3n_> i mean to n var
[09:46:03] <geirha> quotes instead are used to "escape" certain metacharacters from being special, and to stop certain expansion steps from occuring

[09:52:36] <greybot> Parameter Expansion expands parameters: "$foo", "$1". You can use it to perform string or array operations: "${file%.mp3}", "${0##*/}", "${files[@]: -4}". They should *always* be quoted. See: http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/073 and "Parameter Expansion" in man bash. Also see http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/syntax/pe.

[17:19:10] <Soliton> if you have GNU sort you can see if sort -V happens to do what you want.
[17:19:19] <cousteau_> Isn't there a sorting mode that considers both letters and numbers, sorting numbers (sequences of digits) before letters (single alphabetic characters), then sorting numbers numerically and letters alphabetically?
[17:19:28] <cousteau_> Hm, let me check
[17:19:57] <cousteau_> So
[17:20:07] <Soliton> numbers are a lot more complex than sequences of digits.

[17:20:55] *** Quits: prifici (~patri@user/prifici) (Quit: Off to work or bed.)
[17:21:40] <cousteau_> Thanks Soliton!  Will try -V, which seems to be in the manpage, but I didn't notice because the wording was weird (didn't expect it to be called "version sort", and got distracted by -g and -n)
[17:22:44] <omegatron> besides, there are many sort methods (collations) out there .. but many programs only provide the most often used (but may take your locale setting into account)
[17:23:05] <cousteau_> Soliton: how do you mean?  Assuming integer, positive, decimal numbers, with no/ignored zero padding, it would be trivial, right?
[17:23:12] <omegatron> so, if you need some very special sorting, you might to loop over your list with your custom function and a custom comparator function
[17:24:23] <cousteau_> Were you considering decimal points, octal/hex, negatives, etc?  Or is there something else I didn't consider?

[18:22:53] <emg> kubast2: from the INCOVACTION section of bash(1): When invoked as sh, bash enters posix mode after the startup files are read.
[18:23:27] <CrtxReavr> Lots of *nix utils behave differently, depending on the name in which they're invoked.

[20:11:33] <cousteau_> emanuele6: are you talking about running `ls *.txt` or passing ls a literal glob, like `ls \*.txt`?
[20:11:44] <cousteau_> I meant the former, of course
[20:11:54] <greycat> the former becomes the latter if the glob matches no files
[20:12:26] <greycat> the people who wrote ls knew how shell globs work, and designed ls to handle this case in an acceptable way
[20:12:34] <cousteau_> Yes, but the former becomes just `ls` if the glob matches no files and you have nullglob on
[20:12:48] <greycat> that's why you don't use nullglob in an interactive shell
[20:13:21] <cousteau_> And in a non-interactive shell is it any better?

[20:20:31] <emanuele6> using globs in scripts without nullglob or failglob is very impractical, yes

[20:21:42] <cousteau_> (to be fair, having failed matches substitute by themselves is about as wrong if not more than having them be replaced by nothing; the former only works when a dumb user accidentally uses a ? or * in a word without quoting it, the latter may only cause trouble in certain weird applications, and that trouble would still make more sense than a sudden asterisk in a file name)

[22:24:03] <greycat> because grep(1) is an external command
[22:24:21] <emanuele6> [a-z] uses lexicographical ("alphabetical") ordering as described by the locale to define the class as all the character between "a" and "z", [:alpha:] describes a class of alphabetical characters as described by the locale

[23:35:43] <Filystyn> and than hey - read it
[23:35:50] <greycat> ... what
[23:36:04] <emanuele6> userdocs: because i should have said "like 20%" instead of "20%"? :p
[23:36:38] <userdocs> if i gave you 100% you might start slacking

[23:37:04] <Filystyn> I expected program to read, untill character is met, than pass it to me

[23:37:23] <greycat> what the FUCKING hell does this have to do with splitting lines into words?!
[23:37:42] <Filystyn> that's your 20% satisfaction
[23:37:45] <geirha> does your data contain multiple lines?

[23:42:22] <greycat> What the FUCK could they POSSIBLY WANT?!!  What POSSIBLE combination of sh features could they be thinking of?  They want to split a line of input into an arbitrary number of variables.  They don't know in advance how many words there will be.
[23:42:36] <greycat> Did they expect to get a series of variables like REPLY0 REPLY1 REPLY2 ...?!

[23:45:51] <emanuele6> i mean, there is that is portable: while IFS= read -r line; do (IFS=' '; set -f -- $line; for word do do_something "$word"; done); done
[23:45:52] <geirha> at any rate, an sh solution would require more knowledge about how the data you are reading is formatted
[23:46:17] <emanuele6> but it is still using an "array", the positional arguments
[23:46:27] <geirha> but that reads an ENTIRE LINE into MEMORY, which is 80% good, and 25% bad
[23:46:46] <greycat> Oh no, a hundred BYTES?!
[23:46:57] <greycat> My god, who could ever afford that!?
[23:47:10] <emanuele6> you can save some bytes setting the IFS of the read to IFS=' '

[23:54:01] <greycat> How is "set -f -- $line" supposed to work, exactly?  Isn't the word splitting and globbing done on $line before the -f goes into effect?

[23:55:14] <emanuele6> set -f ; set -- $line instead of set -f -- $line
[23:55:42] <greycat> Is the current speculation "I want 'while read -r word; do ...' i.e. each iteration should read and process one word, not one line"?
