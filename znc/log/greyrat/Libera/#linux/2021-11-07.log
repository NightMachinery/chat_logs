[00:05:07] <ayecee> Budd: okay well one useful thing about it, and part of why cameras use it, is that fat filesystem doesn't lend itself to multiple devices writing to it.
[00:05:13] <Blondie101010> in my time (starting to sound old), devices came with a manual that you were expected to read before use, and that was greatly pushed by support, but nowadays manufacturers know that their user base IQ has dropped way below a pigeon brain
[00:05:34] <ayecee> or for one writing and one reading even.
[00:05:37] <rendar> i want to fill a device (e.g. a /dev/loop device) with random data, so i call dd with /dev/urandom, but now my question is: when the device is full (e.g. the image file associated with that /dev/loop has been completely written with random data from /dev/urandom) dd returns an error 'no space left on the device', which in my specific use case it NOT an error: i WANTED to fill the entire device with random data.. but the script also checks if dd returned
[00:05:37] <rendar> successfully to signal an error -- any idea how can i transform that no space left on the device not in an error?
[00:05:55] <cottnn_> evidlo: couldn't you just make your IoT device connect to a hostname controlled by you with it's UUID or something like that, so you'd be able to contact it remotely?
[00:05:59] <Budd> I'm expecting to have the device present as a serial device for streaming data, and a block device (or two) for state data and configuration.
[00:06:03] <ayecee> rendar: use an explicit size for your write
[00:06:14] <rendar> ayecee,  i don't know the device size!
[00:06:20] <ayecee> rendar: can you check the size
[00:06:25] <rendar> ayecee, how?

[00:06:35] <rendar> no
[00:06:38] <ayecee> okay

[00:07:07] <ayecee> rendar: it doesn't
[00:07:15] <cottnn_> it sounds like that would be less fragile than mdns trickery

[00:07:59] <jim> jcass_, yes I did, and responded. I'm back now, and don't have more plans, except I gotta see about the planet market
[00:08:01] <ayecee> you can't, because you don't know how?
[00:08:04] <TJ-> simply do both DHCP and mDNS, and if DHCP server issues a hostname check it resolves via local DNS resolver, and set it locally so your mDNS publisher uses it
[00:08:10] <rendar> Budd, reading 12Tb just because dd hasn't a stupid flag? no, thanks
[00:08:14] <Budd> rendar, write a C or Python program to fill the device, so you get a more specific error code.
[00:08:20] <cottnn_> evidlo: maybe not, i'm just saying that it would be a simpler approach
[00:08:20] <ayecee> rendar: do they have google where you are? "how do i check the size of a block device" seems like a good query
[00:08:24] <rendar> Budd, i don't want to do that
[00:08:43] <rendar> ayecee, it seems that to check the size i have to read the entire device
[00:08:50] <ayecee> why
[00:08:54] <Budd> rendar: What sort if 12 TB device has a mystery capacitY?
[00:08:57] <rendar> Budd said that
[00:09:02] <ayecee> budd didn't say that
[00:09:15] <Blondie101010> what did Budd say?
[00:09:16] <rendar> <Budd> rendar: read the device first to get the size?
[00:09:28] <akoana> rendar: how about checking which error code dd returns (hint: ENOSPC 28 No space left on device)
[00:09:33] <ayecee> rendar: right. you just filled in "entire" yourself
[00:09:43] <TJ-> rendar: using /dev/urandom is not an efficient way to randomise; much better to use dm_crypt + /dev/zero
[00:09:47] <rendar> akoana, that's exactly what i asked for
[00:09:55] <ayecee> rendar: quit your simpering and look it up.
[00:10:03] <rendar> akoana, but does dd returns that code in the process exit code?
[00:10:04] <cottnn_> rent a hostname, put a server on it, and make your IoT device connect to it (periodically or just keep it connected)
[00:10:23] <Blondie101010> TJ-:  true but in many cases efficiency is more important except when dealing with encryption
[00:10:31] <jim> Budd, maybe you can run lsblk? or fdisk -l /dev/thatdevice
[00:10:32] <rendar> TJ-, i know, but i'm falling back to dd if those tools are not present in the system
[00:10:52] <TJ-> Blondie101010: dm_crypt is MUCH faster
[00:10:57] <Blondie101010> ok
[00:11:14] <rendar> there is also this 'scrub' tool
[00:11:47] <akoana> rendar: try it and see, I don't know what version of dd you have and how it would behave in your situation, you can try it on a much smaller fs (hint: make a fs on a file and loop mount it)
[00:11:51] <rendar> but i want to fix this dd issue first, so, can you tell me for sure that dd returns ENOSPC as the process exit code?
[00:11:55] <rendar> so i can check that?
[00:12:04] <TJ-> Blondie101010: its a 'sneaky' trick - you create a temp dm_crypt device on the block device then write from /dev/zero to the new crypt device - it goes much faster than reading from /dev/urandom - it's the fast way to randomise a block device before putting LUKS container on it
[00:12:06] <ayecee> rendar: you can check it yourself
[00:12:17] <rendar> ayecee, to check that, i have to fill 12Tb
[00:12:21] <ayecee> rendar: quit with this "going limp" act

[00:29:15] <cottnn> the problem is that manpages are still more popular and info has no real advantages over manpages
[00:29:22] <xx> I was in a docker container, no editor in it, and had to edit sources.list in order to get an editor

[00:32:01] <TJ-> rendar: dd is writing with bs=512 by default so as long as the device is using sectors of 512 dd only needs the count= /sys/block/$dev/size

[01:14:41] <lacroix> ie, it's not really going to use 128MB blocks, even if it allocates that much memory... you can go ahead with that if it works on your system

[01:15:15] <DLange> they work very well for a lot of blind or seeing impared users
[01:15:16] <hexnewbie> TJ-: I'm not sure about the write() call itself, but at least the 1 GB needs to be copied (to RAM or disk) before you can read() in the same buffer itself.
[01:15:24] <TJ-> hexnewbie: depends on the devices; for spinning disk, RAID and others for example it definitely helps

[01:16:16] <hodapp> cottnn: they work fine on non-JavaScripty pages, which is still a surprising number
[01:16:18] <TJ-> you can tune hte dd block-size with ibs and obs if needed, else both in and out use the bs size
[01:16:30] <lacroix> since your intention is to fully fill the loop device, without hitting an error, you potentially leave a fair amount of space unused with a 128MB blocksize, depending how close the loop device is to an exact multiple of 128MB

[05:01:26] <Shortstop> I ask this because when I've disconnected the external HDD like this, that same server would freak out in the journal pager, and not boot, and try to boot into recovery mode or something from time to time. Didn't know if I could specify this in the same /etc/fstab line

[06:19:45] <Jayha> hrm.. the `Fn` key doesn't seem to be a modifier or have any keycode. Doesn't print anything in `xev` - but it does affect whether I get a KeymapNotify event or a KeyPress/KeyRelease upon pressing the F-keys

[06:26:13] <Shortstop> From that link, Jayha
[06:26:15] <Shortstop>     Use xmodmap -pke to obtain a list of the current keycodes and keysymbols.
[06:26:16] <Shortstop>     Then run xev and press F1 through F12 keeping note of its keycode.
[06:26:16] <Shortstop>     Then make the swap in your ~/.Xmodmap file.

[07:48:33] <rdrg109> So, let's say that I pay for a $960 montly server (it has 1.44$ month price). If I only use it one hour in the entire month, would I pay $1.44?

[09:44:50] <ayecee> consider using the thermald program. it can modulate temperature in more ways than manual fan control.
[09:45:10] <ipatrol> ayecee: https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/YJDpTGt5qr/
[09:45:44] <ayecee> on modern laptops, it's normal to hit thermal throttling regularly under normal use.
[09:46:06] <ayecee> they're sprinters, not marathon runners

[14:19:06] <dax2> hexnewbie: twm (Tab Window Manager)[2] is a window manager for the X Window System. Started in 1987 by Tom LaStrange, it has been the standard window manager for the X Window System since version X11R4. The name originally stood for Tom's Window Manager, but the software was renamed Tab Window Manager by the X Consortium when they adopted it in 1989. twm is a stacking window manager that provides title bars, shaped windows and icon mana
[14:19:06] <dax2> gement. It is highly configurable and extensible.
[14:19:06] <dax2> twm was a breakthrough achievement in the early years, but has been largely superseded by other window managers, which unlike twm, use a widget toolkit rather than writing directly against Xlib.
[14:19:07] <dax2> Various other window managers—such as vtwm, tvtwm, CTWM, and FVWM—were built on twm's source code.

[15:58:49] <evilop> even some machines that ships with gnu/linux preinstalled are pretty much hell and only works with their forked firmware or whatever
[15:58:59] <evilop> so you end up stuck on an old ubuntu version

[16:11:07] <no_gravity> When I type META and start typing, say "G", I have to wait until Gimp shows up, then type the next chart "I" and can hit enter to start it.
[16:11:10] <no_gravity> Is there a way I can just quickly type META-G-<enter> to start Gimp?
[16:11:39] <hexnewbie> What on Earth is META?
[16:11:43] <TJ-> these are the penalities we pain for expecting rapid increases in performance. If, instead, we switched to expecting all software to /improve/ its performance (fast, smaller, less energy) rather than allowing it to swallow up all the extra performance, then hardware wouldn't have to be iterated so rapidly
[16:11:48] <evilop> no_gravity: I found that to be less broken on wayland

[16:12:47] <no_gravity> Tom^: Nice, I will try that from now on and see if it works.
[16:12:48] <TJ-> no_gravity: you can set a custom shortcut
[16:13:10] <hexnewbie> no_gravity: Ah, so you pop KDE's default launcher? Alt+F2 (krunner) has a different set of oddities than the launcher, it may be easier to use (it also used to crash less)

[21:04:49] <TheGuestMovie> msiism: it's when you create a new password with full privileges to get around the new security rules, separate from the password used to login account. I guess the benefit is that if someone guesses your password and bypasses your 2FA, they can't contact Atlassian Support on your behalf.

[21:27:58] <jim> knotMez, I dunno, if you're familiar with git, it might be handy for you to try that

[21:29:49] <TheGuestMovie> knotMez: oh, I assumed that changeset was version 3.0.1. Generally, devs will have tags (run "hg tags") , but this isnt guaranteed

[22:23:12] <ayecee> how does a 10.42.0.1 host reach that then?
[22:23:12] <superkuh> Modern linux uses linked libraries for applications to call functions/etc from. Those linked libraries get changed a lot. Often in ways that break things. So instead of using system libraries people have come up with lots of ways to ship an entire "system" in a container that provides the exact libraries needed to run a specific version a program. It's an abstraction layer.

[23:54:06] <noisebridge> Actually I see what I did I need "tail -$(wc-l < test.txt) - $OPTARG $file.  I pass an argument and I need to know the length of the file minus the request number.
[23:54:12] <Blondie101010> likely cheaper but probably not better
