[00:02:01] <ilmari> iirc java lets you omit `this.` from method calls. but that's really inconsistent as soon as you have another object of the same class
[00:03:10] <Grinnz> also, its compiler knows what you're calling a method on so it's doing it implicitly anyway to follow inheritance
[00:03:25] <ilmari> because in java everything is a method
[00:03:33] <ilmari> as long as you have free functions, you have to disambiguate
[00:03:57] <ilmari> s/long/soon/
[00:04:11] <Grinnz> ah yes, freedom of functions, forgot that part of the 1st amendment

[00:54:00] <veesh> Freedom of functions is just about all that's left from the second amendment
