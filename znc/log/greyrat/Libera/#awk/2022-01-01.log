[14:51:02] <emanuele6> well, maybe unescaping `\\' and `\n' is a little complex
[14:55:02] <emanuele6> if you are going to inject that string in a system(), you can probably use this as a workaround:  gsub(/'/, "'\\''", filestr); gsub(/\\\\/, "'\\\\'", filestr); gsub(/\\n/, "'\n'", filestr); quoted_file = "'" filestr "'"
[14:55:59] <emanuele6> otherwise, you will have to use a loop and do it manually
