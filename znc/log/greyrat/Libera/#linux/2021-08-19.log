[01:19:04] <Psi-Jack> bewees: I thought about the situation myself. I started down the Ubuntu "Server" Path, for a little bit recently with 20.04, then I looked at Debian 10, 10+Backports, and where 11 is and will be with backports.. And I chose Debian.
[01:19:05] <msiism> Helenah: The problem is, new hardware is not trustworthy either.
[01:19:32] <msiism> So, in general: Don't trust hardware.
[01:19:38] <Helenah> A high chance infact. Had it happen soo many times that I just gave up putting secondhand/old hardware into my systems.
[01:19:45] <bewees> Psi-Jack: Did you chose Debian 10 or 11 for server?
[01:19:53] <Helenah> Yes but my point is, old hardware is even less trustworthy...
[01:20:02] <Psi-Jack> 11, of course.
[01:20:02] <msiism> Don't trust hardware and the software that runs on it.
[01:20:03] <bewees> Ehh, 11 just released these days sorry. But would you upgrade to 11 now?
[01:20:14] <Helenah> I've had better look with brand new hardware.
[01:20:17] <Psi-Jack> Because I /know/ when Debian releases, it's rock solid DAY 1

[01:20:23] <BCMM> Kingsy: iotop is good for a quick look at what's using the disks. not great if you need to distinguish IO to a specific device, i guess
[01:20:26] <bewees> Psi-Jack: I see, so you upgrade now from 10 to 11 already

[03:32:41] <hajonnes> masoudd, ok how should I make it work then?
[03:32:42] <uwharrie> right, .xinitrc is typically only read when X is invoked with `startx`
[03:33:06] <uwharrie> and if you're running gnome, it might be doing its own keymap manipulation that'd overwrite your changes

[03:34:07] <hajonnes> uwharrie, I can set the keymap with setxkbmap so it works if I do it in the terminal.
[03:34:55] <hajonnes> uwharrie, I have tried, I can not find my keymap. but it is installed since I can switch to it, just do not find it in the settings

[05:52:44] <ayecee> bobdobbs: no, i mean, separate the values from the formatting, so that you have only the values in a file, perhaps with sed. then, sort each of those files with values alone with the sort command, and then diff the files.

[05:53:43] <ayecee> you can do it like uwharrie's example but you'll need to extract the values before sending them to the sorts

[05:54:26] <ayecee> something like, diff <(sed ... file1 | sort) <(sed ... file2 | sort)
[05:54:40] <ayecee> bobdobbs: okay so what's the problem you're having with diff then
[05:55:03] <FlorianBad> I unplugged a USB drive by mistake and replugged it immediately. It was not in use. It was /dev/sda which is an xfs (no partitioning). Then it showed up at sdb because it thought sda was still busy. I could not mount it so I tried xfs_repair but I had to use -L because it wasn't enough. Problem is even with -L I cannot mount it (wrong fs type, bad
[05:55:03] <FlorianBad> option, bad superblock on /dev/sdb, missing codepage or helper program, or other error.)
[05:55:33] <bobdobbs> oh, I just don't know how to use it. That's all. I just started reading up on it when it was suggested to a me a few minutes back.

[07:18:21] <ayecee> bah. googled it, found a SE post where someone says, the first answer states that the TLS spec does not allow for multiple certificate chains to be exchanged. That explains a lot.
[07:18:52] <tls> letsencrypt used to sign their root CA with another CA
[07:19:04] <[[R]]> thats just standard chaining
[07:19:05] <tls> you can sorta do something like that but no, you can't have multiple chains directly
[07:19:14] *** Joins: Kvothe (~weechat@user/elodin)
[07:20:54] <ayecee> sorta in that your private CA can sign a cert for a public CA, i guess, since they're unlikely to sign yours :)

[11:52:22] <Guest60> hello, i can't seem to be able to move my files from phone to ubuntu
[11:52:40] <Guest60> but i can delete them directly from phone directory
[11:52:58] <hexnewbie> Then copy them and delete them?
[11:53:19] <Guest60> there's no way i can move them?
[11:53:26] <Guest60> because it's faster to move
[11:53:28] <Guest60> than copy

[12:51:37] <DPA> I haven't tried this, but there is a s3fs fuse file system for mounting aws s3 stuff, stuff like the enc2fs file system to transparently encrypt files, and rsync for incremental copying and such.
[12:51:37] <DPA> So mount s3 using s3fs, mount enc3fs or similar over that, and then rsync to where enc3fs is mounted.
[12:51:41] <DX099> anyone knows when we're getting RDNA voltages exposed in the kernel?

[14:04:12] <frojnd> Hi there. I'm monitoring /dev/ttyS4 like this: cat | od -An -t x1 -v < /dev/ttyS4 all is fine. When there is some activity on ttys4 I can see hexa numberse flying out. But what I don't understand is why when running for the second time a program that communicates with ttyS4 I see last chunks from the first try as first chunks of the second try e.g cat for the first try prints: fe 05 04 05 06 01 02 and second
[14:04:14] <frojnd> time 03 03 04 fe 08 03 01. Problem is that 03 03 04 are chunks that should be printed on the first try....

[16:46:23] <Psi-Jack> I do too, since ZFS is not native and can never be native to Linux.

[23:13:07] <ayecee> you _can_ do that, but wget will continue its output to your terminal
[23:13:09] <hexnewbie> I only ever used parallel downloading as means to stare a cut progress bar that displays several progress statuses at the same time. (I think both Downloader for (4?) X and the Windows thing did that). It's unethical to screw the neighbours porn for the speed gain. For the fancy progress bar? Totally worth it

[23:25:08] <supastupid> Hello, how do i find the bus, device, and domain with LSPCI
[23:25:28] <ayecee> rapha: my math is off too. 6W at 5V would be a little over 1A.
[23:25:43] <hodapp> fikran: sometimes that's because it's trying to do RDNS on the IP or something like that
[23:25:49] <ayecee> 3A power supply would deliver 15W.
[23:26:04] <ananke> supastupid: did you look at its manual?
[23:26:23] <hexnewbie> Unless you supercharge every amp!
[23:26:23] <rapha> oh, true
[23:26:30] <supastupid> ananke: Slightly
[23:26:32] <fikran> hodapp: how do i disable that?
[23:26:42] <rapha> still, the 3A supply is probably dimensioned like that because of periphery
[23:26:52] <hodapp> errg, would have to look it up, I forget the details

[23:41:18] <Guest64> does anyone here know of an IIRC program for linux that might resemble telegram or a chat application? something that is, perhaps, more visually pleasing like slack, discord or even AIM?  i was just checking out Hexchat and it keep crashing on my PC. so i'm browsing over the https://alternativeto.net/software/hexchat/ list to search for something

[23:43:33] <Psi-Jack> Guest64: For starters, I ain't your bro, so do not call me such. You said IIRC client, IIRC means "If I Recall Correctly". I was messing with you on that, because it's IRC "Internet Relay Chat.

[23:45:57] <Guest64> what? you want me to add Psi-Jack to my ignore list? Nah, I don't care too much for that. I just figured since he was all salty, because he took the time to correct me, he could just take the next step and wipe me out from his life entirely.
[23:46:16] <ayecee> Guest64: sure sounds like you're salty about him being salty
[23:46:23] <ayecee> Guest64: you should use the ignore instead.

[23:54:36] <mrfb> I'm going to sound bortherline blunt, but if you are asking that kind of questions, this kind of project is beyond for you alone, maybe find some peeps or start small?
[23:54:43] <cAMP> mrfb: initially console based semi-casual turn-based multiplayer, strategy, it will have a planet model with sun, gravity, resources, and factions fighting
[23:55:09] <clarity> Which console?
[23:55:10] <mrfb> for that I'd start simple, a database, an API, and a client

[23:55:31] <cAMP> BCMM: yes, how to infra game server for a Open Source game? So I'm hoping I can write the server, maybe future gets maintainers.

[23:56:33] <masoudd> start with running the client and server locally, worry about hardware for servers much much later
[23:56:40] <mrfb> yeah
[23:56:47] <cAMP> mrfb: so, you'd just hire a virtual host, put some linux distro in there, install/conf/update yourself?
[23:56:58] <ayecee> sure, for development
[23:57:01] <masoudd> Because if your game has no players, you don't need servers really

[23:59:46] <mrfb> cAMP: first, start with an _IDEA_, write it down on paper. Think about features you'd like to have and why. Then select the minimun necesary for the game to be playable, even a small tech demo. Mark a date on your calendar, Start code, Release, Share with people, listen to their rants, Develop again, Release, rise and repeat
[23:59:49] <cAMP> masoudd: well I'm just planning. Must figure out if a multiplayer game server is even possible? Is it too much admin/maintaining work, maybe shouldn't.
