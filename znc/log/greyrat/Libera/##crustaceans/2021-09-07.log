[00:30:07] <manicennui> It's amazing how little impact the MCU has had on comic book sales.
[00:30:35] <manicennui> Probably because the big two are still obsessed with "direct sales" (comic book shops).
[00:31:00] <manicennui> I don't get destroying your business to try to keep something alive that hasn't worked for 20 years.
[00:31:49] <kline> on the flip side, direct sales arent whats making marvel money
[00:32:04] <kline> so theyre not really losing anything other than opportunity in continuing to do the wrong thing
[00:32:10] <manicennui> Marvel publishing doesn't make money.
[00:32:25] <manicennui> I mean, both Marvel and DC are part of huge companies now.
[00:32:37] <manicennui> But the comic book publisher businesses are a joke and have been for a long time.
[00:32:51] <manicennui> The entire American comic book industry is smaller than my employer.
[00:33:27] <manicennui> And the best selling comics are mid grade (aimed at middle schoolers) books published by the big traditional publishers.

[00:34:45] <buttsbot> ICv2: Comics and Graphic Novel Sales Hit New High in Pandemic Year
[00:34:54] <manicennui> "Total comics and graphic novel sales to consumers in the U.S. and Canada were approximately $1.28 billion in 2020, a 6% increase over sales in 2019."
[00:34:58] <manicennui> That's the entire industry.
[00:35:16] <manicennui> "Sales of kids’ graphic novels in mass merchants and online drove graphic novel sales early, and as the pandemic went on (and anime streaming grew), manga sales took off."
[00:36:16] <manicennui> Physical single issue comics were $285 million of that.
[00:36:46] <manicennui> The two segments that are growing are graphic novels and digital comics.
[00:36:58] <manicennui> Neither of which you need comic book stores for.
[00:39:31] <manicennui> I bet Star Wars generates more revenue in books than most of the comic book industry combined.
[00:42:55] <indigo> I bet manicennui generates more revenue in a year than a single comic book store
[00:43:10] <manicennui> Almost certainly.
[00:43:18] <manicennui> The product I work on generates hundreds of millions.
[00:43:34] <manicennui> Manga in Japan by comparison did $5.6 billion in 2020.
[00:44:25] <indigo> What generates more revenue: manga or mango in Japan

[17:23:34] <kline> companion_cube, waaah https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=80c2ec96d6229e3ffe1be798dd9038d3
[17:23:35] <buttsbot> Rust Playground
[17:24:38] <companion_cube> Nice!
[17:24:41] <kline> #rust: "yeah you need to download another dependency to create a new enum type of errors, implement your own error for "wrong addr length" and then add that error plus the AddrParseError as a variants of your ip_parse enum type"
[17:24:53] <kline> this is wank
[17:25:09] <companion_cube> That's if you want to write a nice library kline
[17:25:12] <kline> why have people just decided i cannot use really sensible std lib error types
[17:25:25] <companion_cube> For programs i just use anyhow and that's it
[17:25:32] <riv> that sounds like so much work
[17:25:37] <companion_cube> You can, no one can forbid it :p
[17:25:39] <riv> for something super common?
[17:26:01] <companion_cube> Also you don't need a dependency to create new errors
[17:26:01] <kline> companion_cube, i can what, use AddrParseError?
[17:26:02] <kline> how?
[17:26:19] <kline> yes, i dont _need_ a new dependency, but i need otherwise a load of boilerplate
[17:26:25] <companion_cube> Yes
[17:26:31] <companion_cube> Such is life
[17:27:10] <companion_cube> But you can use already existing error types if they make sense
[17:27:20] <kline> how do i use AddrParseError?
[17:27:40] <kline> it makes sense here, im trying to parse an IP and i have additional logic that determines that an IP would not be valid
[17:27:49] <companion_cube> Does it not expose a constructor?
[17:28:00] <kline> hit Run
[17:28:14] <kline> but the short answer is "no", just because no.
[17:29:12] <companion_cube> Ah if it doesn't have all public fields or ::new then you can't
[17:29:24] <kline> right
[17:29:31] <companion_cube> Just like you can't create a FILE* in C
[17:30:06] <kline> thats fine, a FILE* is something exposed by the OS, it doesnt make sense for a filled-out FILE* to be sourced not-by the OS
[17:30:35] <kline> but it makes perfect sense to raise a AddrParseError if you know that something is not a validly parseable addr
[17:32:14] <companion_cube> It's made private by design, looking at the code :/
[17:32:35] <companion_cube> Exposes no constructor, has one unit argument
[17:32:47] <kline> yes, thats my point
[17:32:50] <companion_cube> I suppose they wanted to reserve the rights to change it later
[17:32:55] <kline> its deliberately gimped to be stdlib only just because
[17:33:30] <kline> so anyone who wants to parse IpAddr's really has to handle not just the stdlib error type but also any hand-rolled type per project that has to define its own
[17:33:33] <kline> it doesnt make sense
[17:34:41] <companion_cube> I'm not sure why you don't call the stdlib parser
[17:34:51] <kline> i do
[17:35:31] <companion_cube> I'd open an issue to ask why it's not public
[17:35:50] <kline> but i have additional business logic that says when an IP is not valid (perhaps because the stream got cut off)
[17:35:50] <companion_cube> And use the stdlib parse on "" to create the error in the mean time
[17:36:26] <kline> "IP address too short!".parse<IpAddr>()
[17:36:33] <kline> madness
[17:36:40] <companion_cube> :D
[17:37:00] <companion_cube> It doesn't seem to include a cause though
[17:37:04] <companion_cube> *yet*
[17:38:23] <kline> again, this comes down to IPv6 being shit, but its the confluence of IPv6 and rust being shit that brings this to the fore
[17:38:52] <riv> what's wrong with ip6?
[17:39:01] <kline> its badly designed
[17:39:09] <kline> i think the design is worse than ipv4 even
[17:39:24] <kline> but the brute strength of moar bits means that its factually more useful for now
[17:41:34] <prussian> https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/net/struct.Ipv4Addr.html#impl-From%3C%5Bu8%3B%204%5D%3E fyi?
[17:41:35] <buttsbot> Ipv4Addr in std::net - Rust
[17:41:44] <prussian> does this not work for you?
[17:42:19] <prussian> similar exists for Ipv6Addr
[17:43:04] <companion_cube> prussian: can't create the error type for wrong length though
[17:43:32] <kline> tl;dr: im dealing with something else that passes the chunks of an IP address along and its not possible to identify the IP address type etc, so the rule has to be that it has to be exactly 4 or 32 chunks long (4x ipv4 octets or 32x ipv6 nibbles)
[17:44:19] <kline> an incomplete ipv6 might be validly parseable, but it could only have gotten into this function from somewhere upstream going wrong, and the result from here would also be wrong
[17:44:43] <riv> oooof
[17:45:32] <kline> ipv6 being variable-sized in its string representation was a mistake
[17:45:51] <riv> couldn't you tell them apart using : vs . ?
[17:45:55] <prussian> the binary representation still has to be 128b
[17:46:17] <kline> having 2^128 addresses and then assigning only a _single_ loopback address was a mistake
[17:46:17] <kline> using the same char to separate double-octets as we use to separate an IP address from a port was a mistake
[17:46:50] <kline> riv, my concern is someone passing [1, 2, 3, 4] and meaning ::12:34
[17:47:16] <kline> which this still doesnt resolve, but still
[17:47:24] <riv> ah i dont understand
[17:47:46] <kline> riv, do you know how DNS PTR types work?
[17:48:02] <riv> not really
[17:48:33] <kline> ok, basically someone gives you chunk.chunk.chunk.chunk.suffix, for example, 4.3.2.1.in-addr.arpa
[17:48:47] <kline> and the server can say "onetwothreefour.com" as the reverse
[17:49:13] <prussian> well... ::12:34 is in the IPv4 /96 block.
[17:49:32] <kline> the specification for this requires that you send every single hex nibble for ipv6, because otherwise its impossible to identify where the :: elided 0 sections are
[17:49:32] <prussian> so it works either way
[17:49:45] <riv> ah i see
[17:50:32] <kline> so in this instance, an ipv6 address passed as 16 nibble chunks cannot be reliably parsed into the correct ip that it belonged to
[17:50:47] <kline> and is probably someone being wrong over the network, so not even in your code, so you need to be defensive against it
[18:15:46] <prussian> I am confused, but good luck
[18:21:13] <kline> prussian, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_DNS_lookup
[18:21:13] <buttsbot> Reverse DNS lookup - Wikipedia
[18:21:50] <kline> basically it allows you to take an IP and get its DNS name by doing a PTR request against something like b.a.9.8.7.6.5.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.8.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa.
[18:23:00] <kline> but since theres no encoding for :: in dns (they could have specified something like S for "skip": 1.S.2 -> 1::2) then you have to use every nibble
[18:23:51] <kline> if you dont get 32 DNS labels for IPv6, its not a valid rDNS lookup, even if naive gluing together of the labels then gives you something thats parseable
[18:24:22] <kline> so you should just detect the wrong number of dns labels (/subdomain parts) and reject non-4/32 values out of hand

[21:32:46] <dimadima> the centralized DNS thing w/ ppl minting money is so obnixous

[22:08:20] <dimadima> the support case to unsubscribe thing should be illegal
[22:08:46] <dimadima> that's been a thing for a while
[22:08:49] <dimadima> verizon does that
[22:09:19] <dimadima> fios did that to my parents
[22:10:04] <prussian> it isn't? damn.
[22:10:31] <dimadima> doesn't seem to be..
[22:35:07] <indigo> In CA, I think the law is that if you subscribed online, you should be able to unsubscribe online. But no law against a support case
[22:35:38] <indigo> I remember trying to unsubscribe from the NYT... that was an ordeal
[22:36:06] <indigo> That's actually most of the reason why I don't hav a subscription to them right now, even though they have some good content (recipes, crosswords)
[22:36:06] <manicennui> Yeah, I'll never subscribe to the NYT ever again.
[22:36:35] <manicennui> Actually, if there is a way to subscribe through Apple, that might be the solution.
[22:36:42] <indigo> Ooh! Good call
[22:37:16] <manicennui> Sad that these fucking morons want to try to cut out the middle man but also can't run a service competently.
[22:37:33] <indigo> Looks like you can. $24.99/month though for "all access"
[22:38:29] <manicennui> The most recent example being HBO Max and Amazon.
[22:39:37] <manicennui> I don't understand why HBO can't hire like a handful of competent developers to work on their app.

[22:41:10] <gerikson> oh god
[22:42:26] <prussian> isn't that what odysee is lol?
[22:43:59] <prussian> i mean, that's what it claims afaik
[22:44:06] <indigo> Once it's on the blockchain, there is no going back

[22:46:32] <manicennui> Just fork it and rewrite history
[22:51:40] <prussian> the future is now.
[22:55:49] <dimadima> "manicennui> Sad that these fucking morons want to try to cut out the middle man but also can't run a service competently." yes
[22:58:09] <dimadima> that is curious
[22:58:41] <gwozniak> gerikson: I'm sure said channel was filled with good, wholesome education
[23:00:37] <manicennui> It was.
[23:00:44] <manicennui> It seems that he violated a rule about contests.
[23:01:21] <manicennui> He required people to comment on a video to enter, which influences YT's algorithm, and is against the rules.
[23:01:26] <manicennui> And some algorithm banned the channel.
[23:01:55] <prussian> sounds reasonable honestly
[23:02:08] <manicennui> In case you need an excuse for that unexplainable bug: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaZ_RSt0KP8

[23:02:20] <manicennui> Basically cosmic rays.
[23:02:51] <manicennui> They show a cool bit flip problem that happened during a Mario speed run.
[23:03:52] <gwozniak> manicennui: it wasn't clear what channel the comment was referring to (not that I watch any of them, mind you)
[23:04:03] <manicennui> gwozniak: Ah.
[23:04:17] <manicennui> Yeah, I'm sure most of the ones he is thinking of are garbage that deserved to be removed.
[23:04:22] <manicennui> MA FREE SPEECH!
[23:04:28] <indigo> I thought bit flips were rather rare
[23:04:35] <manicennui> indigo: They are.
[23:04:41] <manicennui> indigo: But does your boss know that?
[23:04:55] <indigo> I don't think my boss cares too much about bit flips :)
[23:08:07] <manicennui> I'm happy to report that the HN discussion about the banned YT channel strays into covid conspiracy theories.
[23:08:34] <manicennui> The media is hiding the information about the horse dewormer!

[23:10:01] <manicennui> I don't know what to think about that.
[23:10:16] <manicennui> My initial reaction is that I hate it.
[23:16:13] <indigo> Software development with legos!
[23:22:20] <prussian> ya yes, the rad hard PowerPC CPUs
[23:22:52] <prussian> nextlevel stuff came from things like shuttle when it came to that kind of stuff.
