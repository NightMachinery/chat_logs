[21:04:54] <DefiantN> int-e: I think 30% of us forgot we were in here
[21:13:19] <bw> i'm in here until most people are gone
[21:13:27] <bw> because fomo, i guess
[21:14:43] <Peng> I'm in here until bw leaves :>
[21:18:03] <MacGyver> So logically, if I kick+ban bw then the channel will empty and Peng will also leave.
[21:18:12] <bw> lol

[21:30:49] <int-e> Oh the hardcore mode? <3
[21:38:00] *** Quits: EmmyNoether (~EmmyNoeth@oasys.ch0wn.org) (Remote host closed the connection)
[21:43:44] <Dan0maN> just now saw the topic.  one less :)

[22:11:43] <DefiantN> Do you lose if you part and rejoin?
[22:13:12] <MacGyver> Try it and see.
[22:15:21] * DefiantN isn't falling for that
[22:15:35] <MacGyver> I'd really like you too though.
[22:15:52] * DefiantN looks at +i flag
[22:16:03] <DefiantN> meh, alright
[22:16:11] <MacGyver> At some point I might just mute this channel as an added incentive for people to move :P
[22:16:18] *** Parts: DefiantN (~DefiantN@user/defiantn) (Leaving)
[22:16:58] <MacGyver> Natural progression is moving slower today.
[22:17:13] <MacGyver> A network problem would come in handy :P
[22:18:14] <MacGyver> bw: Might want to set the mlock to +intf #crypto btw, instead of just +i.
[22:18:30] <MacGyver> I don't think I can.
[22:48:10] *** Parts: sarnold (~sarnold@ubuntu/member/sarnold) (*poof*)
[22:58:52] <bw> what does that do?
[23:00:15] <bw> aren't those the default?
[23:03:49] <rqsd> mlock are channel modes enforced by services; in the far future, when only ChanServ is sitting here, it may get netsplit away and ##crypto deleted server-side. When it is re-created, it'll only be +i with no forward because the mlock is +i instead of +fi and probably the topic will also be lost, so there won't even be a hint
[23:14:54] <MacGyver> bw: ^ That.
[23:16:12] <bw> Oh, did I mess up the mlock… I’ll fix it in a bit
[23:16:21] <Peng> ChanServ also has a "topic" command, that might save it?
[23:16:47] <rqsd> mlock settings are not cumulative; you have to specify the full mode set
[23:17:25] <rqsd> Peng: ChanServ has a keeptopic option, which is what's relevant here: "SET KEEPTOPIC enables restoration of the old topic after the channel has become empty."
[23:17:58] <Peng> Nice
[23:18:20] <rqsd> I *hate* that I know these things by heart
[23:43:29] <bw> fixed
