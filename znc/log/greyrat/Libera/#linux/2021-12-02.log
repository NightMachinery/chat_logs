[00:00:08] <sysRPL> the bad news is unlike the other cheap usb capture device i returned on monday, this linux doesn't like this premium capture device when using an HDMI splitter box
[00:00:36] <tessio> it's the same on webcams

[00:01:34] <sysRPL> if i plug straight into this capture device, then linux can display video on it ... but if i go through an HDMI selctor box, linux won't show any video
[00:01:37] <patiencezero> Anyone know how to change DUID type offered by dhclient / Network manager? Currently offering DUID-UUID but I want to offer DUID-LL

[00:03:02] <tessio> sysRPL: it is a plug and play right ?
[00:03:02] <sysRPL> i guess people MUST use obs to capture video on linux nowadays
[00:03:25] <sysRPL> yeah. no drivers. it shows as a l4v device
[00:03:46] <tessio> did you try to follow with journalctl -f ?
[00:03:54] <sysRPL> no
[00:04:01] <tessio> so disconnect your device

[00:44:03] <justsomeguy> Witht systemd or firejail, you can start an application in a new cgroup with a memory limit, so it's child processes won't exceed that limit.
[00:44:04] <BCMM> basically it's been very hard to see how much memory firefox, for example, is using, since it split itself in to different processes

[00:45:40] <justsomeguy> with --user
[00:46:13] <justsomeguy> You can also turn on memory accounting, so systemd will use eBPF to track memory of the unit that firefox and its descendants run in.
[00:47:32] <justsomeguy> (This is off the top of my head, I think you may need an extra option flag, and to edit /etc/systemd/system.conf and uncomment DefaultMemoryAccounting=yes.)

[02:04:12] <ayecee> gooble_gobble: if you're lucky, it's in /var/log somewhere. most likely it's not logged, because when the system gets into a state where it emits a panic, it probably can't write to disk.

[03:07:42] <ayecee> pickled herring? i dunno.
[03:07:54] <NyB> ayecee: really? so once all components are resized, the array is as well? Even with bitmaps? Huh... did not know that.
[03:07:56] <xx> probably food for humans, even though I hear penguins are technically edible
[03:08:00] <MarchHare> ayecee: Actually, is it possible to just add two 4tb drives to the array and have it rebuild the array with the 2tb drives in RO? I have two extra sata slots.
[03:08:18] <NyB> xx: what's wrong with pizza?
[03:08:26] <xx> I have to order (or have made) some food for an event about linux
[03:08:45] <xx> NyB: nothing I guess, just was wondering if there's something associated with linux
[03:08:54] <ayecee> MarchHare: not sure what you mean. is it, you have four disks in the raid 10, and two extra connectors you could use?
[03:09:24] <xx> maybe I can have the pineapple pieces on the pizza shaped like a penguin

[03:10:10] <NyB> xx: will there be tables, or do you need finger-food?

[03:10:22] <MarchHare> ayecee: And yes, it looks like I should have two extra sata slots I could plug the 4tb drives into.
[03:10:33] <NyB> xx: how big of an event is it?
[03:10:37] <MarchHare> Copy data to them, let them rebuild on the new array

[13:00:48] <EtherMan> So, I could use some help getting linux installed on this laptop. Before I start, I’d like to point out that I have verified all installation media as well as the drive in the laptop as well as all ram, it’s all fine. But, if I try to install mint, then I very quickly get an I/o error 5. If I try to install Ubuntu, then there’s a constant freezing that just get longer and longer. After letting it sit all night, it had progressed the install 3%
[13:00:48] <EtherMan>  and was now up to about 1second of activity, before it again froze for 30mins before getting another second of activity. So that’s really not going anywhere. For mint, there’s two tips given as potential solutions when I Google, uninstalling the slideshow the installer uses, but this just makes the installer not work at all, and to use compatibility mode for install but then the drive to install on is no longer detected :/. I’m a bit out of
[13:00:48] <EtherMan> ideas in what more I can try. It’s a Lenovo S130-11IGM with an emmc drive :/

[23:30:03] <Gaboradon> Psi-Jack, around 5x 4TB HDDs and 2x 2TB ones, that's it, I need all the space I can get so I don't want to do any mirroring, I'd like to just manually make 2 copies of data and do some checksum comparisons ocassionally

[23:30:22] <mrfb> for a simple layout, like for example 2-D mirror, I'd go with btrfs simply because it's very flexible and easy to manage (add new drives, etc)
[23:30:27] <dostoyevsky2> Psi-Jack: Snapshots are not backups?  D'oh
[23:30:34] <Psi-Jack> dostoyevsky2: No.
[23:30:39] <Gaboradon> Yes, this is my definition of backup under the budget.
[23:30:52] <Psi-Jack> Then look into better options that are actual backup solutions, like Borg Backup.

[23:31:38] <Psi-Jack> snapshots are okay for quick and fast disaster recovery, but not backups. Backups are actual copies.
[23:31:51] <Gaboradon> This data is sitting there on NTFS (at least GPT) and people keep saying how nothing will work and I can't improve anything, I politely disagree, budget is not going to get better and I think I do have more safety if I move to better FS rather thank keep it sitting on NTFS

[23:41:06] <Psi-Jack> dostoyevsky2: To a single storage, no version/revisional history, sure.
[23:41:35] <hexnewbie> dostoyevsky2: Deduplication is more than that, though rsync does file-grained deduplication with hardlinks if you tell it
