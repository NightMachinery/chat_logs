[14:12:31] <ninjin> nagefire: If you are using the version from the Arch package manager, try the binary from the official homepage. Last time I checked Arch repackages Julia and I do not trust them to get it right.
[14:12:59] <ninjin> Speaking here as someone that spend about two months on and off trying to package Julia for Nix only to give up on it because it is bloody hard.

[14:30:34] <lunik19> I believe the AUR has a julia-bin package
[14:52:19] <ninjin> Sure, but it is even “safer” to grab the tar from the homepage. Then you 100% know it is what the release managers put out and nothing else.
