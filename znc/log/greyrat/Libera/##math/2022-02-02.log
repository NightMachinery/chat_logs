[00:11:32] <Neurite> I'm not sure how to start the proof for this one, but I worked out some of it and can see that it's true: http://mathb.in/70051
[00:11:36] <joel135> maybe what you are looking for is an orthonormal basis of the range of your matrix. you can compute the determinant within this subspace
[00:12:33] <joel135> = product of nonzero eigenvalues
[00:15:48] <greenbagels> Neurite: one way to start would be to relate nCk and nCm
[00:16:12] <greenbagels> then you can think about how any discrepancy between the two would have to result in the discrepancy between kCm and (n-m)C(k-m)

[01:04:03] <greenbagels> k can be any number between n and m so that doesnt really make sense
[01:04:41] <Neurite> ah, I'm completely lost then
[01:05:42] <greenbagels> ok; since c(n, k) and c(n, m) are both fractions, they should only differ by some fractional factor
[01:06:06] <greenbagels> if you write out the actual full fractions for both, you should be able to work out what this fraction is
[01:07:37] <greenbagels> so if the two expressions are equal in your original paste, then the other binomial coefficients should also differ by this fractional factor, but in the opposite way
[01:07:49] <greenbagels> because then they cancel out when you multiply
[01:07:56] <Neurite> As in like c(n, k) = n! / k! (n - k)!?
[01:08:02] <greenbagels> yes

[03:57:55] <johnkeats7> ok i give up it's too annoying
[03:58:06] <laurus> So I have a picture here that I think proves that this book's proof is wrong. Take B to be an interval of the real numbers. Take C to be an open interval of the real numbers contained in B. Take c = sup C. Take a to be in B, with a < beta.
[03:58:16] <laurus> Clearly c < a, so a <= c is not true, as it says in the proof.
[03:58:22] <laurus> Is it possible that this book is just typo-ridden?

[05:11:01] <Xardas> Can two segment lines have the same length, but not the same distance ?
[05:12:15] <Batzy> what
[05:12:36] <Xardas> Nevermind.
[05:12:53] <Xardas> I'm just confused
[05:13:05] <Xardas> between the distance and the length
[05:13:24] <Xardas> distance of two points on the plane
[05:13:42] <Xardas> and the length of the segment they make
[05:13:53] <Xardas> Isn't that supposed to be the same ?
[05:15:13] <Batzy> if you have a way to measure distance between points that seems like a good thing to measure length too
[05:16:22] <alphamul2> https://i.redd.it/m5extej8j5f81.png  :D
[05:16:41] <alphamul2> Landmines in coding
[05:16:52] <alphamul2> That math is... awful
[05:17:15] <Batzy> what
[05:17:25] <alphamul2> Yeah, usually, distance between points is equivalent to length
[05:17:34] <alphamul2> For flat space
[05:17:57] <alphamul2> It makes less sense for curved space
[05:17:59] <Batzy> alphamul2: in non-flat space you don't get nice lines though
[05:18:14] <alphamul2> "Non-parallel postulate"
[05:18:23] <alphamul2> :D
[05:19:38] <Xardas> Let's say we have an isosceles triangle, where side A, and side B are equal, and also side A + side B = side C
[05:19:50] <Xardas> Is this possible ?
[05:20:05] <alphamul2> All lines intersect on surface of a sphere for example (they're great circles).  Oddly, you can have an analogy to parallel lines with say, concentric circles, though.

[05:20:42] <Batzy> well actually
[05:20:43] <Batzy> yes
[05:20:45] <Batzy> it's possible
[05:20:56] <alphamul2> All 0 lengths?  :D
[05:21:03] <Batzy> well i am just thinking
[05:21:07] * alphamul2 is a cheating cheater
[05:21:09] <Batzy> it's allowed in the definition of a metric
[05:21:09] <Batzy> so
[05:21:15] <Xardas> Well, if that's possible that mean all points are collinear !!!
[05:21:21] <Xardas> That's getting me confused !
[05:21:36] <Batzy> Xardas: the metric that allows that is probably pretty bad
[05:21:38] <Batzy> how about that
[05:22:11] <Xardas> hmmmm
[05:22:13] <Batzy> what alphamul2 said is probably an example of that

[05:22:49] <alphamul2> It was rhetorical asking for definition
[05:22:50] <alphamul2> meh
[05:22:57] <Batzy> i think you can make a set
[05:23:04] <Batzy> and throw a metric on it
[05:23:09] <Batzy> where distance is just always 0
[05:23:16] <alphamul2> Lengths of 0 are bad because all angles are the same.
[05:23:16] <Xardas> so side A is 2 cm and side B is 2 cm and side C is 4 cm
[05:23:21] <PlanckWalk> It's certainly possible in the Manhattan metric
[05:23:22] <Xardas> that's an isosceles triangle
[05:23:25] <alphamul2> It leads to all kinds of absurd stuff
[05:23:29] <Xardas> and A + B = C
[05:23:36] <Batzy> PlanckWalk: is that taxicab
[05:23:39] <PlanckWalk> Yes
[05:24:04] <Batzy> l^1 or whatever
[05:24:08] <alphamul2> Triangles on surface of a cube are neat, too.
[05:24:08] <Batzy> yeah i guess it is
[05:24:23] <alphamul2> Try it for different polyhedrans
[05:24:27] <Batzy> PlanckWalk: you dont really have a notion of a triangle there do you
[05:24:29] <Xardas> I'm referring to a triangle on a cartesian plane
[05:24:36] <Batzy> i guess in the "0-metric" you also dont
[05:24:42] <PlanckWalk> Xardas: Yes, this is a metric on R^2
[05:24:43] <alphamul2> Oh, then only 0-length works
[05:24:50] <Batzy> Xardas: it owrks on R^2
[05:24:51] <Batzy> yeah
[05:24:57] <alphamul2> Others are algebraicly provable
[05:25:02] <PlanckWalk> With Euclidean metric it requires that A,B,C be collinear
[05:25:09] <alphamul2> Because of that simple equation for a triangle
[05:25:13] <PlanckWalk> (and pretty much every nondegenerate metric)
[05:25:48] <alphamul2> x^2 + y^2 = r^2 <---  There's an entire branch of mathematics based on that equation
[05:26:03] <Xardas> that's the distance equation
[05:26:07] <PlanckWalk> You can define a version of "collinear" based on that metric relation.
[05:26:13] <Batzy> Xardas: PlanckWalk's suggestion is actually really good to look at
[05:26:17] <Batzy> with what you're asking
[05:26:22] <PlanckWalk> Xardas: That's the Euclidean distance, yes.
[05:26:25] <alphamul2> It's also the unit circle ofr radius, etc.
[05:26:37] <alphamul2> Where r=1
[05:26:55] <alphamul2> This gives you the normal solutions for trig
[05:27:50] <alphamul2> That distance equation also gives you area.
[05:27:55] <alphamul2> For unit circle
[05:28:02] <alphamul2> (integrate)
[05:28:31] <Batzy> Xardas: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry
[05:28:49] <alphamul2> It also implies there's specific angle/s for a given ratio.
[05:28:50] <Batzy> that suggestion from Planck couldn't have been cleaner
[05:28:58] <alphamul2> Because of the tangent
[05:30:30] <alphamul2> So, if x > 1, and y > 1, then r is greater than 1.
[05:30:49] <alphamul2> But by how much?  :D
[05:30:56] <alphamul2> Always more than x and y are.
[05:31:35] <alphamul2> It's interesting (boring?) how there's a connection to circumscription

[06:58:07] <a1234> any ideas?
[06:58:07] <isekaijin> First, by the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, we know that ker(phi) contains the characteristic polynomial of A.
[06:58:50] <isekaijin> Second, the minimal polynomial of A contains every irreducible factor of the characteristic polynomial, possible raised to a lower power.
[06:59:20] <isekaijin> So, if the characteristic polynomial of A is square-free, then ker(phi) is generated by this characteristic polynomial.
[07:00:53] <isekaijin> Computing the characteristic polynomial is easy: p(x) = det(A - xI) = (1 - x)^2 - 4 = (x - 1)^1 - 4 = (x - 3) (x + 1).

[07:02:12] <isekaijin> The minimal polynomial is simply defined as the monic polynomial that generates ker(phi).
[07:02:29] <isekaijin> To understand this, let's think geometrically.
[07:02:42] <isekaijin> Let's look at the irreducible factors of the characteristic polynomial.
[07:03:52] <isekaijin> You can think of a square matrix as a linear operator K^n -> K^n, where K is the ground field. In your case, K = Q and n = 2.
[07:03:58] <a1234> is the kernel always generated by a monic polynomial?
[07:04:11] <isekaijin> Q[x] is a principal ideal domain.
[07:04:18] <isekaijin> So every ideal is generated by a single polynomial.
[07:04:44] <a1234> ah
[07:04:55] <isekaijin> And every polynomial can be written as c p(x), where c is the leading coefficient and p(x) is monic.
[07:05:11] <isekaijin> Okay, back to geometry.
[07:05:47] <D5n9sMatrix> Ok, let's go of polynomial study in the matrix!

[07:06:45] <isekaijin> To each irreducible factor q(x) of the characteristic polynomial p(x), we can assign a vector subspace V(q) of Q^n such that, if we repeatedly q(A) at any element of V(q), we eventually get the zero vector.

[07:13:03] <D5n9sMatrix> 1.4 Graphs
[07:13:04] <D5n9sMatrix> Let X be a ﬁnite, nonempty set, and let R be a relation on X. Then, the pair

[07:25:56] <isekaijin> I think this part of linear algebra is really cool, because you can talk about things like “what happens when we pass to a larger base field where one of the factors qi(x) splits into further factors?”, in very geometric terms.

[07:27:22] <isekaijin> For example, suppose we had the matrix A = [0, -1; 1, 0], whose characteristic polynomial is p(x) = x^2 + 1. Working over the reals, p(x) is irreducible, but working over the complex numbers, p(x) = (x + i)(x - i). What happens to the complex eigenspaces of i and -i when we restrict to the real numbers?
[07:29:09] <isekaijin> If we think of R^2 as a subset of C^2, then the complex eigenspaces E(i) and E(-i) only intersect R^2 at the origin. But the direct sum E(i) + E(-i) is all of C^2, hence contains all of R^2.
[07:30:32] <isekaijin> So, just like (x + i) and (x - i) “fuse” into x^2 + 1 (because R doesn't contain i), similarly, the eigenspaces E(i) and E(-i) “fuse” into the A-invariant subspace R^2.

[17:03:47] <greenbagels> it's all about what direction you take as "positive"
[17:03:56] <greenbagels> and it only makes sense in the context of a given infinite line

[18:28:12] <riv> consider M = {0,1,2} with sup(M) = 2

[18:31:29] <remii> Ok. So in the case above with M, then we can maybe start with saying that if sup(M) = max(M) = a, then we are done since the sequence {a} converges to a.

[23:04:16] <Z-module> greenbagels:  if my "complex unit disk" you just mean { z : |z| < 1 }, sure, that's the unit disk in the real plane. Same thing.
[23:04:23] <qbt> I think it's supposed to be a square (with a diagonal?), but I'm not sure how many 0-, 1-, and 2-simplices it would have
[23:04:42] <qbt> Z-module: it's the closed disk but yea
[23:04:51] <qbt> so |z| <= 1
[23:05:08] *** Joins: Pseudocrat (~sudo@user/pseudocrat)
[23:05:55] <Z-module> OK
[23:06:45] <Z-module> { z : |z| <= 1 }  and  { z : Re(z), Im(z) both in [-1,1] }  are certainly homeomorphic.
[23:07:47] <qbt> right
[23:09:04] <qbt> basically, I'm thinking about how we obtain the usual delta-complex for the projective plane by starting from the quotient of the unit disk and the relation z~z^(pi*i)

[23:09:13] <Batzy> what do people mean when they say "the abelianization of a group" I read on wiki that this is like G / [G,G] where [G,G] is the commutator subgroup. Does this essentially just glue together all non-commuting elements and make the resulting quotient group abelian?

[23:09:57] <Batzy> yeah i guess that's right
[23:09:59] <Z-module> Batzy: yes, it's the "largest" abelian quotient of the original group
[23:10:12] <Batzy> Z-module: makes sense
[23:10:26] <Z-module> You force every  z y z^-1 y^-1  to be e, and take whatever consequences that has but no more.
[23:10:58] <qbt> My guess is we start from some delta-complex of the unit disk and then make some identifications according to the equivalence relation but I'm not sure what the delta-complex of the unit disk looks like to begin with.
[23:12:04] <Z-module> Batzy, so one of the main "uses" of this is that for any path-connected space X,   H_1(X) = abelianization of pi_1(X)
[23:12:36] <Batzy> Z-module: in my case i think i am going to consider the abelianization of certain matrix lie groups

[23:13:28] <Batzy> Z-module: thanks
[23:15:36] <Z-module> Also it comes up in things like    the free group F_X (X any generating set) has abelianization  SUM_{|X| copies} Z     which is used for showing things like |X| != |Y|  =>   F_X not =~ F_Y
[23:16:04] <Z-module> free vs. free-abelian

[23:18:05] <greenbagels> qbt: again i have no idea about this algebraic topology nonsense
[23:18:16] <greenbagels> but using the fact that the unit disk is homeomorphic to a unit square
[23:18:22] <greenbagels> https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1487317/is-a-square-a-delta-complex could this be of use
[23:21:59] <qbt> greenbagels: i have looked at that one before, and I think I understand Tim's point, but what I don't understand is if, for instance, that complex would represent the unit disk or not
[23:22:22] <qbt> also yes this is definitely algebraic topology nonsense
[23:24:09] <greenbagels> qbt: if you fill it in with the 2-simplexes, you're considering the unit square, which is homeomorphic to the unit disk
[23:24:40] <greenbagels> that was my mindset, but i dont know the formal definition of this complex (and dont have time to sit down and check it myself)
[23:24:56] <greenbagels> mayhaps you can work out this (filled) square example, from which point it should be clear, i think?

[23:28:04] <qbt> I have tried but maybe I need to look thoroughly at the definition again.... It's just confusing then why the same square (but with the top edge "flipped") represents the projective plane. Like why is the flip of the top edge necessary according to the equivalence relation

[23:57:38] <qbt> perhaps its my lectures that have been kinda vague in this regard, but as I have understood it there are indeed only two in my link, but I would also have an ordering on them. In this case their order would be (clockwise from bottom left) v0, v1, v2, v3, i.e. the same as the other figure. And then we have identified v0 and v2 and labelled them as v, and identified v1 and v2 with the label w
