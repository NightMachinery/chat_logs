[00:18:03] <nexgen> It looks like Perl was artificially removed from popular languages to clean space for things like Python.

[00:19:04] <mmlj4> yeah, I hate it as well
[00:19:08] <nexgen> Perl syntax was not very clear for m, but at least it was acceptable and like CPAN very much.
[00:19:55] <nexgen> I like a lot of ready libs on CPAN very much.
[00:21:12] <nexgen> I guess Perl native compilers can be used to export calls to Perl libs?

[01:43:37] <lustiger_seth> i'm looking for a fast method for reading many datasets (one array with ~50k hashs, each having ~10 key-value pairs) from a file into a perl struct. i may choose the data format arbitrarily. if i use YAML, the reading takes ~20s. if i use Data::Dumper for writing and eval() for reading, the evaluation takes ~5s. what is a faster method?
[01:46:37] <xenu> if it doesn't have to be human readable, sereal probably
[01:47:02] <xenu> also by yaml you meant literally YAML.pm? it's slow because it's pure perl, YAML::XS should be faster
[01:47:12] <xenu> also Cpanel::JSON::XS for json
[01:49:45] <xenu> another option would be to use DB_File (it's a berkeleydb binding) or DBD::SQLite, it's a bit different approach because instead of serializing and deserializing data, you will just keep it on the disk and query it

[08:49:34] <vms14> but print "$string" too
[08:49:56] <gordonfish> simcop2387: When I got my maine coon back in 2007, he was a little over half a year old and it took him a couple of months to stop hiding behind the couch and realize he wasn't going to be shuttled between foster homes and stores for showing.
[08:51:02] <vms14> oh lol I can open a reference to a string?
[08:52:26] <gordonfish> simcop2387: Once he figured out that this was in fact his home, he started to get a lot better, but it still took a few years before he truly became lapable. From what we were told, he was abandonded as a kitten when his people moved out, so he went a bit semi-ferral.
[08:53:40] <gordonfish> simcop2387: Now he's around 14 and always looks for a nice lap in the evenings when he comes in (he still loves to roam outside during the day and evening.)

[08:55:59] <vms14> IO::Handle also adds methods to that string
[08:56:11] <gordonfish> Right
[08:56:37] <vms14> it's nice I wanted something like the format function which writes to data stream
[08:56:58] <vms14> but a special array can be treated as a stream and string at same time
[08:57:01] <gordonfish> sweval: open my $h, '>', \my $buff or die "wtf? open: $1"; $h->print( "$_\n" ) for qw(foo bar baz); $h->close; [ $buff ];
[08:57:02] <perlbot> gordonfish: ["foo\nbar\nbaz\n"]
[08:57:30] <gordonfish> You can use $h with anything that expects a file handle (for writing)
[08:57:50] <gordonfish> I haven't used format() in a long time, will need to refresh on it
[08:58:12] <vms14> I mean the common lisp format function

[08:58:37] <vms14> but in perl is different

[08:59:25] <vms14> it can do more than what
[08:59:31] <vms14> what's represented there
[09:00:02] <vms14> in perl instead you use join and string interpolation instead
[09:01:12] <vms14> I can provide a basic format function that only cares about the stream part
[09:01:45] <vms14> well too much effort for nothing

[20:15:19] <aquanight> karjala: the choice of NFD vs NFC really comes down to preference and maybe a few edge case needs, so long as you're using whichever one consistently.
[20:15:21] <ology> Heehee

[20:15:54] <ology> How old is he?
[20:15:54] <aquanight> karjala: for example, I believe NFD would allow you to use a unicode-dumb ordinal sorting to sort the strings in a roughly sensible order
[20:16:30] <aquanight> karjala: on the other hand, NFC is theoreteically more compact. If space is a concern, NFC can probably optimize space concerns.
[20:16:47] <aquanight> bah. I fucked that last sentence up didn't I.
[20:16:48] <simcop2387> ology: estimated 1.5 years
[20:17:38] <aquanight> karjala: NFC should theoretically be more space-optimal especially if you target languages/regions that heavily use latin characters plus diacritical marks.
[20:18:03] <simcop2387> aquanight: yea dumb ordinal sorting only works on the -D ones, but it's more complicated for locale aware sorting.  NFC can be sorted faster (in theory) for a given locale
[20:18:37] <simcop2387> dumb ordinal sorting will screw up on composed characters vs their non-accented characters
[20:18:46] <aquanight> yeah that's what I mean
[20:18:57] <aquanight> if you plan to do a non-locale ordinal sort, you probably want to use NFD
[20:19:20] <aquanight> of course that also depends on why you're sorting
[20:19:36] <aquanight> if you're just sorting for the sake of a fast binary search, then you can get away with ordinal sorting NFC

[20:41:54] <aquanight> as for removal why wouldn't you just splice() it out
[20:45:57] <simcop2387> aquanight: it depends on how often you do removals.  tombstones let you amortize the time to copy things a lot and cost basically nothing at removal time.  the idea is that you mark the element as unused and you can then just replace it later if inserting or you can do a round of removals and shrink it all at once.  it's a technique to reduce the number of allocations and other memory work you
[20:46:03] <simcop2387> have to do so that you can choose to pay for the cost later when it's fine to do so. 
[20:47:09] <aquanight> I feel like if I was doing a lot of removals I would probably also use a linked list (and put the tombstones somewhere else to reuse in that case)
[20:47:28] <aquanight> because thinking in terms of perl arrays having tombstones inline seems like it would complicate the searching process
[20:48:40] <simcop2387> linked lists can make sense but tombstones + arenas will work significantly better than a linked list performance wise.  in perl it doesn't matter much because of the way arrays work though.
[20:49:10] <simcop2387> using arenas/vectors/preallocated blocks of memory (whatever you wan tto call them) can make a GIGANTIC different in performance due to cache locality
[20:49:24] <karjala> Thanks all for the unicode advice.
[20:49:50] <simcop2387> like a 10x to 100x type performance difference because it can mean that pre-fetchers will work better with your data and it'll cache better
[20:50:30] <simcop2387> for a priority queue in perl i wouldn't even use an array directly, i'd use a hash of array refs.  no sorting needed then
