[12:09:48] <thomasb06> at startup, emacs asks for my auth.gpg password. But if didn't do any mistake, there should be a gpg key associated to avoid it. Maybe I misunderstood what the gpg key is for?
[12:10:11] <thomasb06> The wiki page is:
[12:10:26] <wasamasa> look at your auth-sources
[12:10:28] <wasamasa> look at the files
[12:10:44] <wasamasa> if any of these files exists, there's your issue
[12:11:05] <thomasb06> https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/GnusAuthinfo
[12:11:16] <wasamasa> emphasis on your
[12:11:20] <wasamasa> F1 v auth-sources
[12:12:12] <thomasb06> it says: «Original value was ("~/.authinfo" "~/.authinfo.gpg" "~/.netrc")»
[12:12:29] <thomasb06> and «Its value is ("~/.emacs.d/lisp/circe/.authinfo.gpg")»
[12:12:52] <wasamasa> yeah, go visit that file, chances are you're prompted for a password
[12:13:37] <thomasb06> it didn't, but the password are stared
[12:13:51] <wasamasa> note that once entered passwords are cached
[12:13:58] <thomasb06> and I gave my password to the daemon yes
[12:14:03] <wasamasa> so you might be asked in a fresh emacs instance again
[12:14:17] <thomasb06> is it normal?
[12:14:34] <thomasb06> from the wiki it looked like it's avoidable
[12:14:35] <wasamasa> also consider that gpg behaves differently depending on whether you used a public key to encrypt the file or not
[12:14:48] <wasamasa> if you didn't, it will ask you for the key all the time
[12:15:04] <wasamasa> so when creating the file, make sure you pick a public key or else
[12:15:14] <thomasb06> it's public, I had no key before and made one for this purpose
[12:16:41] <thomasb06> the wiki says «Pick your own name from the list.» and I took time to have my name there
[12:17:21] <wasamasa> anyway, none of this is terribly related to circe
[12:17:39] <wasamasa> personally, I'd advise you to not use authinfo at all
[12:17:46] <wasamasa> really bad API
[12:17:58] <thomasb06> ah, understood
[12:18:26] <thomasb06> so I give my password once at starting circe and this is it?
[12:18:55] <wasamasa> you'll need it for every reconnection attempt
[12:19:27] <thomasb06> no problem: this almost what happens with the authinfo already.
[12:19:36] <thomasb06> Thank you for your insight
