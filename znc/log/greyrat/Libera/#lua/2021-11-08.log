[00:02:26] <kakolainen[m]> yes the reference page has all you need but for learning simple examples are better like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language)#Inheritance
[00:05:51] *** Quits: glguy (x@libera/staff/glguy) (Quit: Quit)
[00:05:55] <tumn> personally I don't recommend doing that with metatables
[00:06:04] <tumn> and the phrasing on that example is somewhat misleading
[00:06:12] <tumn> > "Lua supports using metatables to give Lua class inheritance.[13] In this example, we allow vectors to have their values multiplied by a constant in a derived class. "
[00:06:21] <tumn> lua supports no such thing

[00:07:00] <tumn> sure the example shows a mimicry of class behavior created using metatables, but it's a stretch to say this is supported by lua, a language that has no classes
[00:07:16] <tumn> metatables weren't designed with this usage in mind
[00:07:37] <tumn> or at least it's safe to assume they weren't
[00:08:33] <tumn> depending on where it's used it has a really big performance impact and the same behavior could be created using code that aligns better with the lua paradigm

[00:09:22] <kakolainen[m]> it works fine and performance is good too
[00:09:48] <tumn> performance is good on what lua version?
[00:09:56] <tumn> luajit might optimize some of the problems away
[00:10:03] <tumn> but other versions I don't think so
[00:10:24] <tumn> every metatable lookup is an index, and then calling the metamethod is an extra function call
[00:11:08] <tumn> for each operation
[00:11:29] <tumn> which is even worse when there's chains of "classes"
[00:11:31] <kakolainen[m]> tested with quadtree where every point addition was done via multiple layers of metatables vs some simpler way and no huge difference
[00:12:33] <tumn> I'd be really curious to compare the bytecode generated by both methods of doing it
[00:14:21] <kakolainen[m]> I can try to find one other example which had even more surprising result and metatable was faster than anything else even when it shouldn't have been
[00:15:09] <tumn> and this was with 5.x? or luajit?
[00:18:16] <kakolainen[m]> Lua 5.4 but I don't think there is any difference even with Luajit

[00:20:21] <kakolainen[m]> or maybe my test was testing one level of metatable vs multiple levels and there was no significant difference but against table without a metatable there might be
[00:25:21] <tumn> reusing code in ways that don't involve metatable hacks is still probably safer
[00:25:45] <tumn> which is why examples like that aren't in the lua reference manual
[00:27:38] <tumn> there is some basic prototyping behavior that can even be replicated by just returning a new vanilla table anonymously from a function

[00:47:34] <tumn> I think lua benefits a lot from being simple and having an amount of data types that you can count on your fingers
[00:49:01] <tumn> or at least 5.1 does, and everything that derives from 5.1 like luajit 
[00:50:07] <technomancy> using metatables to mimic classes is bad because classes are bad, not because metatables are bad =)
[00:50:08] <technomancy> if you're going to complicate your code with metatables at least you should get something better than classes in exchange!
[00:51:02] <tumn> technomancy said what I was afraid to say
[00:51:19] <technomancy> well, lua 5.1's support for metatables is kinda shit
[00:51:21] <technomancy> like they can't even iterate
[00:51:25] <tumn> that's true
[00:51:30] <tumn> __pairs is nice
[00:51:45] <tumn> but 5.1 is still my version of choice for a million other reasons
[00:51:52] <tumn> or luajit which even backports some features from 5.2
[00:52:04] <tumn> I don't think it has __pairs but who cares
[00:52:13] <technomancy> I like luajit, but it's a shame that luajit is keeping 5.1 alive, because it really needs to die so everyone can assume metatables work everywhere
[00:52:34] <tumn> it's immortal
[00:52:35] <kakolainen[m]>  __pairs don't really work when you have metatable __index which is maybe the biggest flaw with the inheritance
[00:52:40] <Habbie> don't metatables work in 5.1?
[00:52:49] <Habbie> (serious question, poorly phrased)
[00:52:49] <tumn> they do
[00:52:51] <technomancy> Habbie: only a very limited number of methods work
[00:52:55] <tumn> that's a stretch
[00:52:58] <tumn> most metamethods are in 5.1
[00:53:02] <Habbie> technomancy, is this about operator overloading?
[00:53:12] <tumn> there is a couple of metamethods that are implemented in later versions
[00:53:15] <tumn> that 5.1 odesn't support
[00:53:37] <technomancy> Habbie: it's impossible to use metatables to make (for example) a read-only table in 5.1 because as soon as you try to iterate over it, it will appear empty
[00:54:01] <Habbie> ah
[00:54:03] <tumn> that can be more-or-less solved by storing the length of the table in the table
[00:54:15] <technomancy> tumn: not in a useful awy
[00:54:17] <tumn> there's also __len
[00:54:45] <technomancy> tumn: then every function in your entire codebase has to be like "wait is this a real table or a funky wannabe broken table" and act differently in different circumstances
[00:54:49] <technomancy> you can't pass it off to 3rd-party code
[00:54:56] <technomancy> basically it breaks the entire idea of abstraction
[00:54:57] <tumn> solution 1: make everything a funky wannabe broken table
[00:55:03] <tumn> solution 2: don't (ab)use metatables
[00:55:11] <technomancy> so ... never use code that you didn't write yoruself, basically
[00:55:12] <technomancy> pass
[00:55:18] <tumn> sadly
[00:55:29] <technomancy> I mean, sure; you can do that. but I can't.
[00:56:43] <tumn> the only reason so many modules out there overuse metatables is because lua's ecosystem is overrun by javascriptbrains who can't understand a language that doesn't have complicated data types so they can explain their code using a bunch of buzzwords
[00:56:50] <tumn> that's the same reason javascript was invented to begin with
[00:56:56] <tumn> someone saw lua and thought "I can make this worse"
[00:57:03] <technomancy> I agree re: class systems in lua
[00:57:11] <technomancy> but read-only tables are super useful for sandboxing purposes
[00:57:19] <technomancy> and sandboxing is like ... something lua's supposed to be real good at!
[00:58:11] <tumn> the solution in 5.1 is would be to wrap every unsafe type individaully
[00:58:18] <tumn> then tables can just be real tables
[00:58:22] <tumn> which has benefits even in 5.2+
[00:58:35] <technomancy> by "wrap" do you mean copy?
[00:59:13] <technomancy> I mean, that works in some situations and fails in others
[00:59:30] <technomancy> my point is that there's no general-purpose way to abstract data
[00:59:34] <tumn> by wrap I mean in sandboxing terms, but I guess I'm thinking of implementations of lua that have lots of userdata and wonky libraries
[01:01:13] <tumn> the absolute best way to sandbox lua is probably to just not load unwanted libraries
[01:01:19] <tumn> from the C end
[01:02:00] <tumn> lua's capability for sandboxing goes hand-in-hand with its main purpose which is to be embedded
[01:02:19] <tumn> it's pretty easy to make it not do unwanted things when loading it with the C api

[01:03:59] <Habbie> luau really wants to spearhead sandboxing
[01:03:59] <tumn> in that case the abstraction can come from adding userdata types, you could even add a custom pairs() that works with whatever weird data types you want to be iteratable, or give them their own custom iterators
[01:04:19] <technomancy> IMO it's a huge red flag if you can't create an abstraction without using a different language
[01:04:32] <tumn> Habbie: luau is a great example because the roblox api is very complex
[01:04:51] <tumn> technomancy: not really, lua and C are one and the same - lua is written as a scripting supplement to C
[01:05:03] <technomancy> well I hate that
[01:05:09] <fcr> in any case requiring the use of  :pairs() / :ipairs() is not that ugly
[01:05:24] <technomancy> fcr: and edit every 3rd-party lib to do the same? no thanks
[01:05:40] <tumn> problems with 3rd party libs aren't problems with the language
[01:05:41] <fcr> (unless obviously you have a pairs attribute)
[01:05:50] <technomancy> tumn: hard disagree
[01:06:44] <technomancy> a language without an ecosystem is borderline useless
[01:09:28] <Habbie> i use lua as a scripting supplement to C++; some people use it as a scripting supplement to other languages
[01:09:42] <Habbie> but it is, to me, mostly, indeed a scripting supplement to -something-
[01:12:28] <Habbie> however, i don't agree Lua and C are one and the same
[01:13:05] <glguy> I'm not arguing that it's the norm, but my most recent Lua project uses Lua as the primary language. The main event loop is a small C program using ncurses and libuv, but all the logic is in Lua.
[01:13:39] <glguy> Lua's C API and the Lua language are pretty independent
[01:14:00] <glguy> and I've done a Lua implementation in Haskell; it's not key that it's in C
[01:19:38] <Habbie> yep
[01:19:52] <Habbie> glguy, did you implement Lua in Haskell? or write Haskell bindings for liblua?

[01:35:16] <glguy> the former
[01:39:14] <Habbie> nice
[01:41:05] <tumn> the lua project and C go together by design (C++ too by extension) of course not including implementations of the vm in other languages
[01:41:29] <tumn> that's why the language has concepts in it like userdata and cclosures
[01:42:02] <glguy> userdata is a wrapper around a memory allocation, nothing particularly to do with C
[01:42:20] <tumn> it is to do with C because the lua project is written in C
[01:42:21] <glguy> closures are more about a wrapper around *Lua* upvalues, not C
[01:42:45] <tumn> there are even messages in lua that directly reference C e.g. trying to yield a cclosure throws "attempt to yield across metamethod/C-call boundary"
[01:43:53] <tumn> the main project is an embeddable language for C projects, of course there are other famous implementations but lua at core goes together with C
[01:44:02] <tumn> > closures are more about a wrapper around *Lua* upvalues, not C
[01:44:07] <tumn> there's a distinciton between cclosures and lclosures
[01:45:33] <glguy> "C closures" don't feature in Lua, they're part of the C API
[01:45:58] <tumn> the c api is packaged as one of the main parts of lua
[01:46:12] <glguy> that the reference implementation provides, and there's nothing about them that has to be implemented in C, just need a function pointer with the right calling convention
[01:46:14] <tumn> that's why all of the features that let you edit what your lua implementation can do are provided by the C api
[01:46:37] <tumn> of course - but you agree it's supposed to be embeddable right? regardless of the implementation language?
[01:47:19] <tumn> because technomancy's argument was that it's a bad sign if a language relies on using a different language to operate
[01:47:55] <tumn> but that's a weird argument for a language that's advertised as being an embedded language (with the reference implementation being in ansi C)

[01:51:52] <DixieFlatline> metatables confuse me - I find it hard to think of writing a program in pure lua ... metatables in general make me think lua is lisp-like but with tables instead of lists and parens
[01:51:55] <tumn> I think it has the advantage of being designed from the ground up as being made for embedding

[01:54:36] <DixieFlatline> although that won't stop me from trying though
[02:06:05] <kakolainen[m]> technomanc is right it's a bad sign when you can't do some important thing with your programming language, like C is a shit language because you can't even do bignum with it since it's missing access to the carry flag
[02:09:20] <kakolainen[m]> and there is about zero CPUs whcih don't have the carry flag
[02:14:47] <glguy> C's meant to be embedded in an assembly program if you want access to the system-level stuff like that *nod*
[02:15:00] <glguy> You just write your high-level logic in C, of course
[02:16:42] <technomancy> it's not even that you have to rely on another language that's bad
[02:16:57] <technomancy> like ... needing to use C to call OS routines like sockets and stuff; whatever. understandable compromise
[02:17:17] <technomancy> it's when you can't do basic algorithmic abstractions that it's a bad sign
[02:17:24] <technomancy> thankfully fixed in 5.2+
[02:17:33] <tumn> basic algorithmic abstractions like what?
[02:17:46] <kakolainen[m]> what you can't do with Lua 5.4?
[02:17:49] <technomancy> like "this data structure is read-only"
[02:18:04] <technomancy> kakolainen[m]: I'm only talking about 5.1's pisspoor metamethod support
[02:19:34] <tumn> __index makes read-only tables easy, the only thing 5.1 is lacking is factoring __index into the # size when __index is a table
[02:20:08] <tumn> which, to be fair, isn't exactly expected behavior anyway, it's a convenience feature
[02:20:37] <tumn> __index is just "this will be used as a fallback when the table index is nil"
[02:21:25] <technomancy> tumn: read-only tables which can't be iterated aren't really tables
[02:21:41] <technomancy> if they don't act like tables they're a bad abstraction
[02:22:00] <tumn> you've got it backwards - "read-only tables" in lua aren't actually read-only
[02:22:24] <tumn> the real problem is in pairs() which does some weird internal thing to get the size of an array-like table and doesn't respect __len
[02:22:32] <tumn> (in 5.1)
[02:22:35] <technomancy> this is 100% not a problem in 5.2+
[02:22:49] <technomancy> you can create abstractions that work seamlessly with any code
[02:24:09] <technomancy> it honestly sounds like your argument is "5.1 is good enough for me so it should be good enough for anybody"

[02:25:46] <tumn> the way 5.2 fixes it is by monkey-patching in behavior where you wouldn't expect it to be by reading the spec unless you were trying to do something very specific (like mimic a read-only table); a problem that isn't visible at first, but as we go up the lua versions and more and more one-off features are shoehorned into the language and the
