[00:02:04] <nedbat> OliverUK: you can choose a random value from a generator without running the whole generator, or storing all the values.

[00:04:34] <p-i-> gloin: you're repeatedly populating the inter[0] key
[00:04:50] <nedbat> OliverUK: you can do it without storing all the values, but you do have to iterate the entire generator

[00:43:27] <nedbat> aphysically: who wrote the code? Also, what types doesn't mypy like?
[00:44:01] <aphysically> I was repeatedly trying to raise all exceptions for some futures when I closed them, so I was trying writing a little subroutine: https://bpa.st/RDNQ
[00:44:23] <aphysically> it says the future is of type concurrent.futures._base.Future

[00:49:29] <aphysically> re 1) I'm not completely convinced of exhaustive type hinting myself, but I think it makes sense to continue the effort in this script I'm writing mostly self-pedagogically to make sure I'm comfortable with even thornier issues that may crop up later

[02:27:51] <stealth_> super() calls the parent __init__
[02:28:36] <stealth_> if you subclass `__init__` parent `__init__` is not run, with `super().__init__` you are saying, also run parent `__init__` method.

[02:52:27] <gloin> I'm understanding right that dict is just a set of key-value pairs, right? And that assigning a new key/value pair to that dict should simply add another entry, right? Because that's not the behavior I'm seeing here: https://bpa.st/GDIQ
[02:52:30] <theprophet> oh i see, so i am overwriting the cat init with the goat super()? cause i got a name atribute there?
[02:53:00] <gloin> it looks like the dict is being overwritten entirely each time I attempt to add a new key/value pair to it
[02:54:01] <KirkMcDonald> gloin: You appear to be making a new dict on each iteration of the loop.
[02:54:06] <theprophet> if so, how come that goat still has the its own name when printed and cat has its own and nothing is messing up?
[02:54:40] <gloin> KirkMcDonald: that's the behavior I'm seeing. What I want to do is add entries to the dict, not wipe it each time

[03:04:55] <KirkMcDonald> theprophet: https://bpa.st/3WZQ
[03:05:12] <theprophet> ok so, having the same atribute after super in chil class means i am overriding the parent init is that correct?
[03:05:23] <PantelicGR> theprophet: no
[03:05:49] <PantelicGR> you just overwrite self.name
[03:05:52] <KirkMcDonald> theprophet: The word "override" has a specific meaning in the context of OOP.
[03:06:11] <theprophet> then what do you mean by overiding the init? how did i do that?
[03:06:28] <theprophet> did i do that in my code?
[03:06:42] <PantelicGR> theprophet: also there is a mistake in line 22: self.name = age instead of self.name = name

[03:07:28] <KirkMcDonald> theprophet: The `cat` class defines an __init__ method. The `goat` and `dog` class are each a subclass of cat, which also define a method named `__init__`. This is overriding the __init__ method.

[03:09:35] <KirkMcDonald> theprophet: Sure.

[03:49:49] <Vaurien> Hello, folks, been banging my head over an issue that I've been unable to find any fully workable solution via Googling/searching.  I need to be able to run a program via 'subprocess' that requires user input that MUST be done interactively while displaying the output of the command in real time (in this case, the command is 'terraform apply'; for
[03:49:49] <Vaurien> those who have used Terraform will know what I'm referring to).  The issue I'm hitting with everything I tried is that the user prompt doesn't end in a newline, so the output will "pause" without displaying the final part for the user to see.

[03:51:16] <Vaurien> would know how to help?

[05:14:36] <meejah> without something like TUF, jabberwock's problem is still a problem (even with "signatures")
[05:14:45] <muhblockchain> proper way would be of course to have each package author sign package with a key, and have that key signed by admins of pypi.org (they attest that project foo belongs to author with fingerprint 0xabcd...)
[05:15:02] <meejah> muhblockchain: you have just tried to describe TUF
[05:15:15] <muhblockchain> then, at least attacks on https (or web server, or CA) are a solved problem. if package foo is malicious then it is only it's author who is to blame
[05:15:37] <jabberwock> meejah: I don't disagree with what you're saying. "Trust" is still extremely subjective.
[05:15:38] <muhblockchain> s/it's/its
[05:16:23] <jabberwock> muhblockchain: what you're talking about might deter the layman in the basement. Not the government at the manufacturing facility
[05:16:32] <muhblockchain> jabberwock: trust might be hard, but at least we can get accountability.  and trust that e.g. "package foo, as released by 0xabcd... seems o.k." can be built over time (and code can be reviewed; pin down versions using sha256 of package, in addition of other checks)
[05:16:32] <jabberwock> but not trying to discount any progress.
[05:17:19] <meejah> muhblockchain: this is the best kind of problem: a solution exists, and just needs money thrown at it

[05:19:16] <meejah> muhblockchain: run devpi and audit (or at least confirm sigs) before putting updates in then
[05:19:19] <jabberwock> I was being devil's advocate. I really think it's a good idea though. Just nowhere near the #1 solution (to which I have no idea)
[05:19:46] <meejah> muhblockchain: true, PyPI has many newer updates than Debian. This geneeralizes to all of debian, though: bleeding-edge or security, pick one
[05:19:52] <muhblockchain> jabberwock: any better solution builds on that, with additive security of audits from various groups, with track record, and all that

[06:29:28] <nedbat> Forty-Bot: foo = collections.defaultdict(dict);   foo['bar']['baz'] = 'quux'
[06:29:33] <grym> Forty-Bot: e.g., `foo = collections.defaultdict(dict); foo['bar']['baz']='quux'` will always work
[06:30:07] <Forty-Bot> cool, thanks
[06:32:02] <Forty-Bot> hm, this makes me want infinite defaultdicts...
[06:32:23] <grym> you can do that
[06:32:58] <grym> you need to be slightly more clever
[06:33:45] <grym> and the repr's ugly

[12:07:47] <ApostleInTriumph> stealth_ basically I do some array operation in each line and my code is taking longer than expected. I wanted to know which of them are costly
[12:07:57] <ApostleInTriumph> would this library suit my purpose?
[12:08:36] <stealth_> ApostleInTriumph, yes overall
[12:08:42] <susam> ApostleInTriumph: Wouldn't call stack profiling achieve that? A call stack profiler would sort your call stacks in the decreasing order of time consumed (actually it is more complicated than that).
[12:09:02] <susam> ApostleInTriumph: Then you can drill down into each level of the call stack and zero in on the function that is consuming most of your CPU time.
[12:09:17] <nubonix> pyeverything: and features?
[12:09:24] <ApostleInTriumph> susam stealth_ I see. thanks I will give this a shot
[12:09:33] <nubonix> pyeverything: and what are features*?

[12:11:07] <nubonix> or, are you trying to extract where in the image that the model classified the bee or ant to be?
[12:11:26] <susam> By the way, there is another trick I used to use that has worked well for me. In fact, it works quite well if the bottleneck consumes more than 95% CPU. Just Ctrl + C when the program seems to be busy. Do it 5 times. The KeyboardInterrupt backtrace will show the busy call stack about 4 out of 5 times.

[12:36:36] <theprophet> how often you guys use super()?
[12:37:10] <pycode> hello everybody, i am using pandas most of times but now i need to create a project that works with a "stream" with a stream i mean that via API i receive 1 call every 1 second less or more with some prices and then i need to store those prices AND do few stats over that data, so at the beginning, for example i do df['mean'] = df['price'].mean() then when new data i need to update that "mean" column because i have another endpoint
[12:37:10] <pycode> that need to returns mean/std and other stats so basically i have 1 endpoint to store that "stream" and another one to return stats
[12:37:32] <nubonix> theprophet: super is used when using inheritance for classes
[12:37:39] <pycode> i think pandas is not good for "real time" data, so what can i do to handle that data and do realtime stats over it
[12:37:54] <stealth_> nubonix, you should like pop ip from the `previous_server_ips`

[12:41:40] *** Joins: darksun (~darksun@user/darksun)
[12:42:13] <theprophet> ok for what i know about overriding is when you gotta methods with same name, but what is overriding in that code you wrote?
[12:42:36] <nubonix> if you notice, it prints foo, then it prints bar, this is because of inheritence
[12:42:57] <nubonix> so if you inherit in a class, you have access to all the variables and methods [functions] within the other class
[12:43:00] <theprophet> yes i did but, what is the benefit there?
[12:43:30] <nubonix> you grabbed the previously declared variable self.msg
[12:43:46] <nubonix> self.msg was declared in foo, and you are passing it to bar
[12:44:17] <nubonix> then with overriding, you basically did self.msg = 'bar', so the foo self.msg is ignored, as it is overwritten by the self.msg in the bar class
[12:45:01] <nubonix> so inheritance is used when you have two classes, and the second class builds upon the first class

[12:46:56] <theprophet> msg bar
[12:47:11] <nubonix> it will print bar, because it basically deleted the previously stored variable
[12:47:54] <theprophet> so overriding means litteraly overwriting over previous variable is that correct?
[12:47:59] <nubonix> there is a technical term for this double something, but this is the same idea as overriding
[12:48:11] <nubonix> yes
[12:48:21] <nubonix> or you can think of it as that
[12:48:31] <nubonix> as im not sure how python actually handles it, but it doesnt really matter
[12:48:58] <theprophet> i was confused, because everytime i googled overriding the answers were all saying that its just a situation where you have 2 or more function with same name

[13:09:13] <KirkMcDonald> Gurkenglas: This you cannot do, because it's not that yield pauses a function, it's that the presence of a yield means it isn't really a function at all, but a generator.

[13:09:49] <KirkMcDonald> Gurkenglas: And you can't change foo from a function to a generator from a callback.
[13:10:00] <KirkMcDonald> Gurkenglas: This happens at compile time.

[13:17:01] <theprophet> nubonix
[13:17:01] <theprophet> The main advantage of method overriding is that the class can give its own specific implementation to a inherited method without even modifying the parent class code.

[13:19:32] <nubonix> theprophet: the advantage of overriding in classes is using inheritence, think of it as building blocks. building block2 relies on building block 1, as building block 2 inherits from building block2. you can build , building block 2 without building block 1, but it makes it easier if you use inheritence
[13:19:37] <nubonix> theprophet: overriding in classes? quite often, in functions, rarely, and its usually only to comply with pep8 characters in a line limitation
[13:20:30] <KirkMcDonald> theprophet: I would not frame it in terms of advantage. That is the thing that it does.

[13:20:56] <Gurkenglas> yield is much cheaper than the equivalent implementation using a queue, right?
[13:21:32] <nubonix> theprophet: this is not something i would do... i would definitely consider this example to be a bad practice
[13:21:59] <theprophet> nubonix i see, thank you.
[13:22:00] <KirkMcDonald> Gurkenglas: I'm not sure I can answer this without seeing code. It is not clear to me what you mean by "a generator of the values."

[13:23:21] <nubonix> theprophet: also, another reason overriding in a function is kind of a bad idea, is if you are going to learn other programming languages, because unlike python, there are languages that do not support this feature

[13:57:00] <Gurkenglas> and how expensive can that be, anyway? just have a tree of callstacks like git branches share most of their history and having multiple callstacks is cheap, right?

[14:00:58] <iomari891> KirkMcDonald: I thought of that but the user may be viewing the output file for quite some time and I thought it would good to terminate the python code while viewing.
[14:01:01] <KirkMcDonald> iomari891: Another option is os.execve() and friends, though this can have other concerns.
[14:01:10] <DnzAtWrk> why is tkinter not more popular
[14:01:23] <DnzAtWrk> seems to be perfectly sufficient for most of your needs
[14:01:32] <KirkMcDonald> iomari891: You can also launch the subprocess with subprocess.Popen() and then end the Python script before it finishes.
[14:01:32] <Gurkenglas> KirkMcDonald, the user of the library! ;_; maybe instead of returning a generator he should return a "foo that calls bar with _", because you can convert one way but not the other? ...
[14:02:31] <KirkMcDonald> Gurkenglas: To go back to the re.sub() example, the questions I'd have are: What is consuming the generator? And what is receiving the return value from re.sub()?
[14:03:01] <iomari891> KirkMcDonald: I didn't know I could do that with Popen.
[14:03:26] <KirkMcDonald> iomari891: All of these things behave in slightly different ways.
[14:04:08] <iomari891> KirkMcDonald: How can I make Popen exit while a process is open?
[14:04:43] <KirkMcDonald> iomari891: subprocess.Popen() does not block. It starts the process and gives you a Popen object.
[14:05:22] <iomari891> KirkMcDonald: I should have know that. Thanks. That's exactly what I'm looking for.
[14:05:32] <Kingsy> what is the best way of adding query string parameters to a url string? i.e auto determining ? and & depending on its current state

[14:05:55] <iomari891> KirkMcDonald: understood
[14:06:46] <KirkMcDonald> Kingsy: It is probably most sensible to parse the URL and its query parameters, then add the new parameters and format it back out.

[18:02:01] <grym> ApostleInTriumph: that's how i'd do it
[18:02:10] <grym> length isn't really relevant here
[18:02:27] <kosh> I can't think of a faster way to do it
[18:02:34] <grym> or a clearer one
[18:02:39] <kosh> regardless of length because of how hashtables work
[18:03:19] <ApostleInTriumph> what do you mean by length being irrelevant here?
[18:03:21] <bjs> ApostleInTriumph: yeah I don't think it's the solution that's expensive but the problem :)
[18:03:40] *** Quits: blingrang_ (~blingrang@user/blingrang) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[18:03:50] <bjs> lists just don't convert into hashtables very easily,  you basically have to individually pair up elements and insert no matter which solution you pick
[18:03:52] <grym> ApostleInTriumph: no matter how long your lists are, a dict comp is how i'd make a dict
[18:04:07] <kosh> ApostleInTriumph, as in we don't know of a way to pre-allocate the dictionary to speed the creation
[18:04:07] <ApostleInTriumph> I see
[18:04:30] <ApostleInTriumph> bjs instead of starting with lists, is there a data structure that is more hashtable friendly?
[18:04:31] <kosh> ApostleInTriumph, if you where creating a matrix out of it there are ways to make it MUCH faster
[18:04:52] <bjs> ApostleInTriumph: well you can start with the dictionary and just insert directly :)

[18:21:04] <bjs> Gurkenglas: that doesn't really sound "first" vs "second" class in the way people usually mean those terms.  It just sounds like a totally different feature
[18:21:19] <ApostleInTriumph> kosh there's a small issue. yes it's in order. Basically keys are hashes i constructed. The values of my dict are pytorch tensors. They must remain so because they will be back propagated at a later time
[18:21:22] <dontyouloveshort> how do you mock a funtion withon a function that you would like to test?  in my case the funtion that is tested gets its data from sql, and i want to set that result

[18:21:44] <bjs> Gurkenglas: Python typically wants to make things explicit.  It's why we have `yield from` and `async def`,  which enforce explicit annotation of functions that yield control
[18:21:49] <bjs> even if deeper in the call stack
[18:23:23] <bjs> Gurkenglas: Python *could* have designed them in different ways and got something like lua coroutines or C's setjmp/longjmp but it's just not the typical Python style of programming.
[18:23:35] <Gurkenglas> bjs, something is first-class if you can manipulate it like any other object. In this case the thing that it should be invariant under but isn't is extracting a block a a function :)

[18:23:57] <bjs> Gurkenglas: I mean your solution isn't first-class either,  since "yield" is more a bit of syntax and semantics rather than an object
[18:24:30] <bjs> in Python the `yield` syntax just means you create a generator object when you call the function and that generator is very much first-class
[18:24:42] <Gurkenglas> I suppose so. Ideally yield be a function that you call, and then its implementation manipulates the callstack.
[18:25:36] *** Parts: OnlineCop (~OnlineCop@user/onlinecop) ()
[18:25:37] <bjs> Gurkenglas: why do you say "ideally"
[18:25:38] <Gurkenglas> the varname package does well enough at this; having to specify the number of stackframes to skip is a relatively small price i suppose
[18:25:51] <bjs> Does "ideally" just mean "in Gurkenglas's opinion" ;)
[18:25:57] <kosh> ApostleInTriumph, if the keys and the order is static you could just create a dictionary once that maps key to index position
[18:25:59] <Gurkenglas> bjs, I agreed that my solution wasn't really first-class either, and what it'd take to get there

[22:17:57] <bjs> it's not really about variables,  but about how safe that operation on the underlying set is (or rather how safe it is not)
[22:19:05] <whatsupdoc> why can't you make it safe?
[22:19:35] <whatsupdoc> can't you just decrease the size of the array or list and just continue from the same index where you left off after deleting and you'll be fine?

[22:19:51] <bjs> whatsupdoc: that's _exaclty_ the situation that is not fine
