[00:00:01] <neshpion> Jong: since your shell is most likely bash, the "book" you're looking for would be `man bash` or even `info bash`
[00:00:04] <jim> Jong, heh, sounds exciting... meanwhile, would you like some tips and videos? (I'm guessing you're new to linux, and maybe to unix too?)
[00:00:06] <neshpion> :D
[00:00:27] <MrElendig> most of those are quite old and how correct they are about modern systems may vary
[00:00:33] <MrElendig> accurate*
[00:00:53] <Jong> ayecee  funny thing is that I bet if you took 100 coders with CS degrees and asked them the name of part of the command line that's the prompt, I bet over 50% wouldn't know it's called prompt
[00:01:06] <matsaman> MrElendig: you talking about all books, or just those in his list? =D
[00:01:14] <MrElendig> those in the list

[00:01:35] <Jong> PS1 ? why?
[00:01:48] <ayecee> Jong: how many of those coders use unix regularly
[00:01:54] <matsaman> Jong: it's a variable name that refers to ... the prompt
[00:01:55] <Jong> all of them
[00:02:07] <neshpion> try this (it's temporary and goes away when you close/reopen the terminal):    PS1='type me daddy >'
[00:02:08] <circuitbone> facebook and irc don't really mix.
[00:02:09] <jim> well, PS1 is a variable that you set to how you want the prompt to look
[00:02:09] <MrElendig> Jong: many shells uses the PS1 "variable" to configure it
[00:02:16] <ayecee> Jong: if you took 100 coders with CS degrees who used unix regularly, then probably most of them would know that.
[00:02:18] <Jong> matsaman  does that mean echo $PS1 should work? Wouldn't it be listed in env then?
[00:02:20] <MrElendig> but most of those also accepts PROMPT
[00:02:27] <matsaman> Jong: yup, yup
[00:02:28] <daddy> neshpion: 🙄
[00:02:29] <ayecee> Jong: i mean, if they were english speakers.
[00:02:40] <MrElendig> Jong: its special and might not show up in env (depending on the shell)
[00:02:41] <Jong> echo $PS1 outputs: \[\]${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\[\]\u@\h\[\]:\[\]\w\[\]\$
[00:02:43] <neshpion> daddy: lol didn't know someone had that nick in here
[00:02:46] <MrElendig> ymmv

[00:59:05] <neshpion> yeah i get the impression that modern C++'s main feature set, STL, is adapted for general programming, and for kernel-level stuff you might not end up using STL but rather have to roll your own anyway -- like vector, maybe?
[00:59:11] <neshpion> i'm not well versed in the argument but that's my impression
[00:59:22] <smoke> i have heard that the forbidden os is also partially written in c++ :)

[01:01:36] <hodapp> but one fairly substantial reason is that Rust has the ownership/borrow checker done at compile time, which (barring use of 'unsafe') prevents large classes of memory-related error altogether

[02:06:08] <cousteau> I do
[02:06:11] <absentia> cousteau: it sort of is - but more swap also means more virtual memory... means more page faults... more memory being swapped between disk & RAM...
[02:06:13] <Elw3> If your programs dont actually crash for real then the answer is no
[02:06:16] <Psi-Jack> swap is NOT usable "memory", you have to load swap into RAM to use it.
[02:06:18] <ayecee> cousteau: pretty much. it's a place to park unused pieces of programs so that the memory they were filling can do something useful.
[02:06:29] <cousteau> I'm using 100% of it for this stupid game, and then some swap

[03:25:59] <cousteau> rascul: OK so swap is some sort of "intermediate memory to make it easier for RAM to swap stuff"?
[03:27:23] <cousteau> Back in the day the rule of thumb was "twice as much swap as ram" for some reason, but it is my understanding that that no longer holds
[03:27:26] <mlu> cousteau: ever run out of short-term memory so you needed to write things down?
[03:27:41] <mlu> swap is like that notepad
[03:27:51] <mlu> it's slower than using that memory alone but it's cheaper and bigger

[03:50:48] <Intelo> I wonder
[03:50:59] <cousteau> The binary says "access this global variable or function that is stored in memory position 0x1234", but if you have multiple instances of a program running simultaneously, you need multiple addresses 0x1234, one for each program

[03:53:18] <Intelo> hodapp was I able to clear my point?
[03:53:38] <hodapp> Intelo: I think it's pretty rare for something like this to be done
[03:53:41] <cousteau> So when you call the function in the binary, you say "jump to the function located at absolute memory position 0x1234"
[03:54:02] <Intelo> hodapp then how do you think file browsers work?
[03:54:07] <aa_> Intelo browser must call the command LS if you are the browser coder it's easy, but if you want do it with a page or javascript I think it's not possible
[03:54:17] <ayecee> cousteau: it's still relative to the program's perspective. two programs might agree there's a box at 0x1234, but it doesn't have to be the same box.

[03:59:50] <Intelo> aa_ rascul I just did 'strace ls' and I understand now. but what about things that do not have a syscall or api.  lets say there is an already existing app that someone else made and I want to make a gui on top of that cli app. what options do I have?

[08:20:39] <tirnanog> something is wrong then.
[08:20:40] <aa_> and cant login, but the homepage seems ok
[08:20:45] <tirnanog> I'm looking at it right now.
[08:20:56] <aa_> must be the adblock as you dsaid
[08:21:14] <tirnanog> it's not that aggressive though. did you customize it in any way?
[08:21:25] <aa_> no
[08:21:28] <aa_> default configs
[08:21:29] <tirnanog> or use any add-ons that affect how the user-agent may present itself?
[08:22:22] <aa_> just the adblock
[08:22:34] <tirnanog> so there are no extensions installed of any kind?
[08:22:47] <aa_> not at all
[08:23:00] <tirnanog> huh. that's strange.
[08:23:15] <tirnanog> and it's up-to-date? (1.35.101)
[08:23:21] <aa_> let me check
[08:23:44] <aa_> [study]$ brave --version
[08:23:47] <aa_> Brave Browser 85.1.13.82 unknowny
[08:23:58] <tirnanog> time to upgrade.

[10:04:08] <tirnanog> or a named one, I should say.

[10:23:01] <tirnanog> KBar: it's like saying [[ $line == *'window id # '0x* ]

[10:23:15] <tirnanog> if it doesn't match, next line.
[10:23:40] <tirnanog> otherwise, carry on and do what you were going to do.
[10:24:17] <tirnanog> if that doesn't seem intuitive, however, just leave it as it is.
[10:24:57] <tirnanog> the present approach doesn't require a continue statement because there is nothing that happens after the case statement anyway.
[10:25:01] <KBar> yeah, im struggling to understand its use a bit, but im gonna research anyway. more knowledge doesnt hurt
[10:25:16] <tirnanog> do you understand what continue does?
[10:25:24] <KBar> yes
[10:26:43] <tirnanog> so, logically, if you execute nothing for the case that a more specific pattern matches but continue if it matches *, it's akin to saying [[ $line == pattern ]] || continue.
[10:26:50] <tirnanog> early continue, so to speak.

[13:33:45] <hexnewbie> I wonder if gzipped empty string is always 20 bytes?

[18:14:51] <octav1a> Hello, I had asked a question about running an app at a larger-than-native resolution before, and someone suggested using the Xephyr to make a nested X server. The app is automated testing (selenium). In general Xephyr works great, but there is an issue where every so often the screen will go black, until I hover mouse over it, sort of like a screensaver, and the automated testing starts failing until I 'wake it up'. Is there a way to set no screensaver-

[19:40:22] <Gustavo6046> the reason this is relevant is that your settings might be laid out differentlyt
[19:40:33] <rendar> if you go in Advanced
[19:40:39] <Gustavo6046> rendar, how come the TV is interfering with your machine?
[19:40:41] <rendar> you'll see the menu i used, to create a profile
[19:40:44] <Gustavo6046> Also, maybe the resolution is the same and it's just messing with the DPI
[19:40:53] <rendar> Gustavo6046, no!
[19:41:22] <rendar> Gustavo6046, i set 1920x1080, and when i turn on the TV it increased that resoltion to be 3200x..something, basically it becomes 2K 19:6

[19:46:44] <Gustavo6046> ahh okay
[19:46:47] <rendar> typo!
[19:46:58] <Gustavo6046> maybe 1024x768 is just the default for when X doesn't see any display
[19:47:06] <Gustavo6046> it should be able to save and remember the settings though
[19:47:08] <Gustavo6046> and any disconnected displays
[19:47:15] <rendar> yes!
[19:47:18] <Dagmar> In other words, with the TV off it boots up and X has no idea what resolution you want it to run as, so it just goes with 102x768.
[19:47:19] <rendar> that's the point!
[19:47:25] <Dagmar> Maybe you should try telling X what resolution you want it to run as
[19:47:30] <Gustavo6046> mine did remember the CRT monitor when I unplugged the VGA from the laptop back when I had a crappy old CRT monitor as a second monitor of sorts
[19:47:31] <rendar> Dagmar, yes

[19:48:01] <Gustavo6046> did you even read the full backlog? scroll and read

[21:10:26] <zetaE> if tcpdump could've show interbridge activity I could've realized quicker the error

[22:09:32] <Tucupitano> humanBird, contacting the NSA O-o
[22:09:33] <kubast2> Tucupitano, yeah I know as much, the update is causing the IO pressure spike; I likely just missunderstand the program which handles the audio volume up keypress event and how it trickles down to change the volume levels+display an hud; Maybe I am missing that there's some file read that happens in the software itself, that isn't a "virtual" interface like a dbus unix socket and an alsa audiocard interface;
[22:09:33] <Jong> Is this a good channel to ask questions about the linux terminal given that usage is highly dependent on the terminal client?
[22:10:02] <kubast2> Like on it's very basic, the hud is either cached or loaded into ram pernamently;
[22:10:14] <Tucupitano> Jong there are not stupid questions, just stupid people
[22:10:22] <Tucupitano> :v
[22:10:41] <Tucupitano> kubast2 never noticed that
[22:10:43] <Jong> Programs like iterm2 are called the "client" right?  I see it called the terminal, but there must be a distinguishing between the terminal and the software that uses it. Just like ssh and an ssh client, ftp and an ftp client
[22:11:12] <Tucupitano> One thing is a Terminal Emulator
[22:11:13] <colo> Jong, it's Terminal Emulator, becauuse these programs emulate terminal hardware (and then some)
[22:11:40] <colo> Jong, for a good read about all this, check out https://www.linusakesson.net/programming/tty/
[22:12:01] <kubast2> Tucupitano, yeah I got an ryzen 5 3500x, and it's like that since I use pipewire pulseaudio implementation instead of pulseaudio, which I use because the latter started spewing a lot of noise at some point
[22:12:41] <Tucupitano> Real Terminals are old machines, like typewriting machines, or like Display+keyboard without any CPU... well... technically nowadays a Display and a keyboard+Mouse are called "Terminals"

[22:15:35] <kubast2> Tucupitano, because I tried a couple of changes in the pulseaudio configuration, to mitigate this issue I got after an update of pulseaudio(that issue was a couple of months ago tbf), but I didn't found a solution to the high noise/crackling when chainging volume, so I started using pipewire-pulse since

[22:17:33] <RayTracer> humanBird: so either use an existing group from /etc/group or add a www group to make this go away
[22:17:50] <Jong> I feel uncertain when I use the word terminal. Is "GNU Terminal" the word, when referring to the program where I can run cd, ls, grep, history | tail -10,   env,  nano ~/.bashrc,  nano ~/.profile,  and so forth?   Are there other synonyms?
[22:17:54] <sybariten> I'm getting tired of always having four windows open, two of them may be SSH somewhere and i cant tell the difference that quickly
[22:18:19] <kubast2> Jong, nope, it is usually just, "terminal emulator", the program most people interact with within the terminal emulator being "shell" most popular of which is "bash" and "zsh", "terminal multiplexers" like "tmux" or "screen"; The terminal emulator has it is own definition of special character symbols which mean a specific thing "terminfo", the terminal emulator is a GUI to the pseudoterminal interface which sends information and receives information from

[22:30:27] <sybariten> uh right, you wrote that earlier... is that a variable that exists in the system?
[22:30:31] <geirha> sybariten: if [[ $SSH_CONNECTION ]]
[22:30:33] <Jong> well, I'm using aws ec2 insances running ubuntu 20.04. I think I can install zsh ?
[22:30:47] <Jong> or it's probably already included. I think I just switch to zsh?
[22:30:50] <geirha> SSH_CONNECTION is one of the environment variables set by sshd when you log in

[22:34:07] <Tucupitano> Jong, to siwtch to zsh, just write zsh and you will be promted to zsh. To make the change permanent, i think you have to add the start up on zsh on one of your init scripts (like .bashrc)
[22:34:15] <kubast2> sybariten, to rephrase; The bash binary itself won't care it still communicates over pts, but your profile can be set to do something with the shell; And bash shouldn't likely be filtering out the terminfo for ssh to do something wacky specific to it;
[22:34:20] <zetaE> Jong: Description: "There are two display modes. The first, multiline mode, is the default. It only works if the TERM parameter is set to a valid terminal type that can move the cursor up. The second, single line mode, is used if TERM is invalid or incapable of moving the cursor up, or if the SINGLE_LINE_ZLE option is set. This mode is similar to ksh, and uses no termcap sequences. If TERM is "emacs", the
[22:34:26] <zetaE> ZLE option will be unset by default."
[22:34:38] <kubast2> So you can't make the bash aware, but you can make the .profile script which runs at bash launch detect whether it runs in the ssh session or not;

[22:36:11] <kubast2> so if you mean like you have an screen/tmux bash session running launched locally, by physically being at the computer, and then connecting up via ssh
[22:36:22] <water_27300935_> Can I build Winsows executable binary on Linux?
[22:37:02] <kubast2> then the settings you set won't be applied again, the profile is set at start, you can at best source a profile which doesn't check for the ssh connection(since the bash session was run by a different non-ssh process)

[22:53:25] <Henry151> i set up one of those "pi-hole" things with a raspberry pi
[22:53:26] <ayecee> what do you want to do about that
[22:53:36] <SpiceMan> Guest76: is that ruby? try #ruby
[22:53:37] <Henry151> dang thing is a pain-in-the-butt
[22:53:59] <ayecee> may have installed the pi in the wrong place
[22:54:00] <Guest76> SpiceMan it's bundle install
[22:54:18] <Henry151> it introduces a single failure point to my entire network; if the little micro-usb plug providing power to the raspberry pi gets disconnected, the internet goes down in my entire house
[22:54:30] <SpiceMan> Guest76: so yes
[22:54:44] <ayecee> more like i dunno
[22:54:51] <Tucupitano> whats is a pi-hole?
[22:55:06] <Tucupitano> Sounds like something i should not speak about
[22:55:09] <Henry151> besides, to get it to work i wound up buying a linksys router and installing openwrt, because my xfinity router wasn't configurable enough to tell it to use the pi as a dns server for all requests
[22:55:24] <ayecee> Tucupitano: a thing to block ads
[22:55:29] <Henry151> so then i find that openwrt has its own adblocking capabilities, rendering the entire pi-hole redundant
[22:55:30] <Guest76> SpiceMan complete error here:

[22:55:31] <Tucupitano> A kind of Proxy?
[22:55:39] <ayecee> yes
[22:55:55] <Tucupitano> Why configure it in the router instead if it already use OpenWRT?
[22:55:56] <Henry151> Tucupitano: it's a thing where you set a raspberry pi up in between your network and the internet, and it blocks all ads
[22:56:03] <Tucupitano> why not*
[22:56:07] <Henry151> well exactly
[22:56:13] <Henry151> the pi is now completely redundant
[22:56:14] <Henry151> and useless
[22:56:17] <SpiceMan> Guest76: I don't use ruby. also, I don't know what part of "try #ruby" was unclear.
[22:56:21] <ayecee> Guest76: this is not the complete output.
[22:56:24] <Tucupitano> *sad bruh noises*
[22:56:30] <ayecee> Guest76: show the complete output.
[22:56:45] <Henry151> but i have it all set up, and i haven't got around to un-setting-it-up, so for now if i bump the power cord and the pi shuts off, down goes my entire internet
[22:56:48] * hexnewbie installs an IRC tracker in a pixel in Henry151's IRC client to circumvent the pi-hole
[22:57:00] * Henry151 gasps
