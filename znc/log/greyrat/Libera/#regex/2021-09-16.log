[00:03:21] <purplex> But the regex matches before \n and adds a \r
[00:03:43] <purplex> Essentially, for the purpose of turning \n to \r\n
[00:04:11] <purplex> The second regex does it more explicitly

[02:37:05] <OnlineCop> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubvSjW6Nyqk seems to be the same (or very similar) Damian Conway talk on "Everything you know about regexes is wrong" that we're linking in !tuts.
[02:38:31] <OnlineCop> http://www.infoq.com/presentations/regex was where the original video came from; I believe someone in #regex (back on f***node) had uploaded that video to YouTube.

[02:41:54] <OnlineCop> It starts off intimidating, but then he "restarts" in very simple terms, and goes through it as though you were looking at a program with functions and try/catch blocks.
[02:42:37] <OnlineCop> Because of that description, it helps you understand how * and + work for possessive (maximal) quantifiers, *? and +? for lazy (minimal) quantifiers, and so on.
[02:43:04] <purplex> Yeah the programming stuff is a bit much, hm on first look and terms maximal and minimal seemed off as well
[02:43:15] <OnlineCop> It _mildly_ goes over character group syntax and which characters are considered regex metacharacters, in various regex flavors, and in which situations.
[02:43:57] <purplex> Does it tell anything about how regex engine backtracks and processes input string?
[02:44:18] <OnlineCop> I've seen a few people create regex tutorials in a kind of playlist, but it's always tedious to sit through "this doesn't apply to me" content.
[02:44:34] <OnlineCop> Yep: it discusses backtracking because of how * and *? would act differently.
[02:44:50] <purplex> Are there any examples considered or, just intimidating people with theory?
[02:45:45] <OnlineCop> It's concrete examples. "The ant was eaten by an anteater" searching for 'ant|antler|anteater" and why it wouldn't match what you expect if it became "The anteater ate the ant".
[02:46:16] <purplex> Yea, that's a good example
[02:46:21] <purplex> I might see it. Who's this author? A well known regex personality?
[02:46:37] <OnlineCop> I tend to learn better when I'm shown concrete examples and they highlight "This is where it matches, and WHY is matched." and "This is where you would expect it to match, but this is WHY it matched something else."
[02:47:27] <OnlineCop> Damian Conway is probably one of the better- known speakers on regex, perl, and a few others. I wouldn't be surprised in the slightest if he's lurking in the #perl or #raku (or whatever perl6 is called) channel.
[02:47:29] <purplex> Yes, I am the same person who prefers to keep track of things which are necessary during a learning session.
[02:49:39] <purplex> Oh, its that guy who made this debugger: https://metacpan.org/pod/Regexp::Debugger right, right I have seen it.
[02:51:49] <purplex> A computer scientist. This person is definitely good. He knows what people need to learn regex.
[02:55:14] <purplex> Let's download that video (I would), in case that goes missing too.

[17:58:21] <re101-cow-57> This is super cool, however it seems to be including everything before the first '/' too
[18:00:55] <digitok> the part you want is in group 1
[18:01:04] <digitok> which programming language will you be using it with?
[18:01:49] <re101-cow-57> python, so I presume doing a re.match() followed by using the group 1. That makes sense
[18:02:25] <digitok> yep, you'd need to use the 'regex' module if you wanted it to be returned as the full match
[18:02:47] <digitok> python regex doesn't have the feature required for that
[18:02:52] <digitok> (re module)
[18:04:10] <re101-cow-57> Thanks a lot! 
[18:04:16] <digitok> yw :)
[18:04:33] <digitok> although
[18:04:46] <digitok> re.search only grabs one match doesn't it
[18:05:18] <digitok> you could probably use (?<=/)(?:abc_)?[^/.]*

[18:51:57] <MagentaRV_hex> I wouldn't want to use regex for that.  Your example looks like it'd be easier to explode or split or whatever python uses for that.
[18:52:06] *** MagentaRV_hex is now known as MagentaRV

[19:05:06] <digitok> it would be more efficient, yes. you would probably want to split on / first, then .
[19:05:28] <digitok> you would also need to remove abc_ if present
[19:16:14] <MagentaRV> I know nothing about Python itself, so I looked stuff up as I went, but https://pastebin.com/ECDcHQdt works.  I'm sure you'd want to make a function out of it and run it that way.

[20:16:40] <purplex> daoudr_: Maybe? Don't rely on what's default, you can always check. E.g., regex101 uses default " delimiter for python, but I never had to escape " when I used regex inside the language.
