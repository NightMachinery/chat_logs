[00:00:38] <ville> pointers are objects
[00:00:39] <xkoncek> i was wondering whether my tree visit should be const or nonconst

[00:01:49] <xkoncek> yeah, pointers themselves don't have anything to do with the objects they point to
[00:01:51] <ville> is it guaranteed the tree object compares equal to a copy to it self before the opeation
[00:02:20] <ville> tree x; tree y = x; x.op; assert(x == y);
[00:02:28] <xkoncek> ... i didn't think comparison would make sense
[00:02:58] <ville> even if you're not implementing it, that's a question you can ask
[00:03:34] <xkoncek> i would go with a shallow approach

[08:32:11] <hnOsmium0001[m]> at some point I just gave up using conan center recipes directly
[08:32:56] <hnOsmium0001[m]> I have a dedicated `deps/conan` folder that contain recipes from conan center, that require fixup to work on my machine and I couldn't be bothered to PR to fix
[08:33:15] <hnOsmium0001[m]> I just change the recipe names to have a prefix of my project name and build to for each project manually
[08:34:16] *** Joins: cahoots (~cahoots@cpe-24-193-233-195.nyc.res.rr.com)
[08:35:38] <computerquip> Yeah, I planned on making my own repository for recipes with my own user/channel
[08:35:55] <computerquip> But for most of them, I'm just going to copy and fixup from conan-center as the base.
[08:36:02] <computerquip> Just a bit surprised as the low-quality of some of them.
[08:38:07] <hnOsmium0001[m]> what I found is basically everything that either autotools to build, or somehow depends on gtk are a huge hit or miss
[08:39:50] <computerquip> I can thankfully stay away from the gtk stuff. I remember writing up the original recipe requests some years ago for cairo, gtk+, glib, etc. and it ended up being a super difficult request.
[08:40:16] <computerquip> A lot of that stuff is not fun to build at all... especially outside of the Linux ecosystem.
[08:40:33] <johnny> it should be better now shouldn't it?
[08:40:40] <johnny> now that it's no longer autotools
[08:41:04] <johnny> gstreamer and friends should build directly on windows even with msvc
[08:41:29] <johnny> i've yet to try gtk though.. but glib would get pulled in for gstreamer
[08:41:50] <computerquip> I mean, anything is better than autotools for Windows.
[08:41:55] <computerquip> I'm sure meson is a touch better.
[08:42:02] <johnny> it's a LOT better
[08:42:35] <johnny> so.. maybe too specific such that i won't get an answer.. did anybody upgrade from clang 13 to 14 and have their clangd break?
[08:43:07] <johnny> fedora finally got clang 14 (in the beta for fedora 36), and it broke my clangd . it can't find system includes
[08:43:24] <johnny> the clangd changelogs are never very good, so you can't tell if something actually changed or not
[08:43:34] <johnny> i mean clang changelogs :)
[08:45:15] <computerquip> I think part of the problem with buildsystems for things like cairo is that when it gets ported to something like meson, they refuse to change how anything is done... so they drag all the intricacies that autotools have with it.
[08:46:12] <computerquip> Sometimes that's a good thing for compatibility. Hard to tell sometimes.
[08:46:59] <johnny> well i dunno about cairo in particular, but i know gstreamer is CI tested on windows, which means glib would run as well
[08:48:05] <johnny> unrelated to C++, but it's pretty interesting to see how that's all gonna play with wine moving more stuff to thewindows side from the unix side, so all that stuff is gonna include libs built with mingw for use on the windows side
[08:49:37] <johnny> i forgot to mention the most important part. this is for an embedded project, so i'm using --query-driver=/path/to/arm-eabi-none-gcc/bin/arm-eabi-none-g*
[08:52:27] <hnOsmium0001[m]> it's not that the buildsystem is bad nowdays, most of the time it's because GTK has so many transitive dependencies and it's quite sensitive to the version of them; if some downstream package happened to need a different version and override GTK's own version (because it has lower priority due to being upstream), the build may fail for some completely random reason
[08:53:02] <hnOsmium0001[m]> such as missing a symbol from some random library that probably nobody uses except GTK, or the macro definitions are conflicting in some form causing the compiler to complain
[08:57:31] <johnny> well, that's a different proble than the autools issue
[08:58:09] <johnny> i realized i had another C++ project I could test with, and it works there
[08:58:10] <hnOsmium0001[m]> yeah, what I said about autotool and gtk are meant to be 2 separate issues, not one
[08:58:29] <johnny> that one isn't embedded

[13:43:23] <ville> LordKalma: you're getting a copy anyhoo to stuff your things into std::string and on top of that it has the allocator baked into it so you can't even get the memory for those copies from the right place

[14:01:20] <LordKalma> well, big chunkus of memory need malloc anyway

[14:27:53] <ville> PJBoy: also one more thing choosing pmr-like by default is that it does make testing different allocator kinds fairly alright. and then after you've picked the allocator kind you can see if going from pmr-like to non-pmr-like shows any improvement. the selection of the allocator kind is probably higher-order of magnitude in the gains than getting rid off the virtual calls

[15:57:51] <LordKalma> basically they reused software from Ariane 4 (Ariane is a series of european spacecraft), but that caused an integer overflow on Ariane 5
[15:58:07] <LordKalma> the integer overflow put an error code on the bus, that was not equipped to deal with it

[15:59:27] <LordKalma> Haohmaru, the problem was not different CPUs. The Ariane 5 was massively more powerful than Ariane 4
[15:59:41] <LordKalma> the sensors/bus weren't recalibrated so that the values fit in the same register

[15:59:58] <urdh> they did, lol
[16:00:10] <Haohmaru> then wtf "integer overflow"
[16:00:28] <urdh> the hardware exception was caused by converting an out-of-range 64-bit floating point number to a 16-bit integer one

[16:04:14] <LordKalma> they were starved for resources and made dumb decisions. One of them is letting a system communicate with another system without a sanitization system

[16:16:03] <PJBoy> move_only_function is more generic
[16:17:07] <PJBoy> I'm surprised btw
[16:17:19] <PJBoy> std::map does seem to be able to use a reference to std::function as its comparator type
[16:17:49] <lpapp> then why not func?

[16:18:24] <PJBoy> it does take a reference to function type too
[16:18:37] <lpapp> then why did my original attempt not compile?
[16:18:47] <PJBoy> it's just that decltype(func) for a first-class function gives you neither a reference nor pointer
[16:19:07] <LordKalma> you needed function pointer, and got whatever else

[17:06:24] <LordKalma> because when you do int a; float b; memcpy(&b, &a, sizeof(a)); it's `float b;` that starts the lifetime
[17:06:33] <LordKalma> rpav, standard blessing
[17:06:49] <rpav> LordKalma: "it just works"
[17:06:50] <LordKalma> lpapp, please use godbolt for examples and test code
[17:06:53] <ville> LordKalma: now do it with copying into byte buffers
[17:06:53] <PJBoy> even if b's lifetime wasn't started, memcpy would start it
[17:07:28] <PJBoy> if I knew where memcpy was in the standard I'd prove it
[17:07:31] <rpav> PJBoy: that seems dubious
[17:07:42] <rpav> memcpy doesn't do anything object-lifetime-relevant

[17:08:46] <LordKalma> what's an implicit creation?
[17:09:15] <rpav> gotta clikc the link
[17:09:21] <PJBoy> it creates an object as per usual
[17:09:39] <PJBoy> for implicitly creatable types
[17:09:51] <PJBoy> http://eel.is/c++draft/intro.object#10
[17:09:58] <rpav> this seems either broken or an exploitable loophole in the standard
[17:10:12] <ville> why not both?
[17:10:16] <LordKalma> well
[17:10:18] <LordKalma> my question is then
[17:10:25] <ville> the c++ object lifetime rules are very complex
[17:10:36] <LordKalma> how can you create a buffer for memcpy to copy to and NOT start lifetime?
[17:10:38] <PJBoy> bit_cast also implicitly creates objects, malloc, and std::allocator::allocate
[17:10:59] <ville> LordKalma: object of different type. you have array of bytes and start a float there
[17:11:16] <LordKalma> and how is that related to memcpy?
[17:12:08] <rpav> what's the simple thing where not having an object created would have a visible effecta
[17:12:09] <ville> LordKalma: see the second link PJBoy pasted
[17:13:00] <rpav> PJBoy: ok actually i think the correct reading of this is probably that it creates _character_ objects in the destination region
[17:13:24] <ville> "have to do X, unless the rest of the following 1500 pages makes it defined. good luck"
[17:13:27] <rpav> not that if e.g. you're memcpy to a float, it creates a float object, because that's impossible and nonsensical
[17:13:37] <PJBoy> it creates whatever allows for well defined behaviour
[17:13:38] <LordKalma> I mean, I can understand this example: http://eel.is/c++draft/intro.object#12
[17:13:39] <rpav> but it _is_ sensical that it implicitly creates `n` char
[17:13:49] <PJBoy> so if you access those bytes as a float afterwards, then it created a float
[17:13:56] <ville> rpav: sense has nothing to do with this discussion
[17:14:21] <LordKalma> PJBoy, so you can literally type-pun to anything *after* memcpying into a buffer?
[17:14:25] <rpav> PJBoy: no, that's not necessary, because the float is already created, and as elsewhere you can always access an object by char
[17:14:41] <ville> rpav: no you can't
[17:14:57] <rpav> why don't i have ville on ignore again
[17:15:07] <LordKalma> because, like, int a[]; float b[]; memcpy(b, a), it's float b[] that starts an array of floats, not memcpy
[17:15:20] <PJBoy> nah like if you have a `char buf[n]; memcpy(buf, obj, obj_size); float& f = *(float*)buf;`
[17:15:26] <PJBoy> then memcpy created a flat
[17:15:29] <PJBoy> float
[17:15:34] <Haohmaru> /ignore is for the weak
[17:15:51] <lpapp> LordKalma: no idea how to use godbolt
[17:15:54] <LordKalma> so you're saying that int a[]; float b[]; memcpy(b, a); (double*)b[0] is well defined? beacuse the memcpy happened?

[17:17:10] <lpapp> LordKalma: https://godbolt.org/z/GEcTeesEq
[17:17:10] <LordKalma> okay, the fact memcpy allows you to type put to whaatever you want in a buffer that was memcpied into is... interesting
[17:17:19] <LordKalma> smallville7123, a C union is a C++ union
[17:17:26] <LordKalma> the unions don't know what they are holding
[17:17:29] <LordKalma> the std::variant knows
[17:17:33] <PJBoy> it's what people want from memcpy
[17:17:36] <ville> LordKalma: no they are not. c allows punning. c++ doesn't
[17:17:44] <LordKalma> and yes, C unions allow type punning
[17:17:52] <PJBoy> people make these assumptions about memcpy anyway, so might as well legalise it
[17:18:20] <LordKalma> PJBoy, well, I thought, and I what I see around is that people understand, like in my example, is that it is the float b[] that creates lifetime
[17:18:28] <LordKalma> didn't know about this
[17:18:30] <LordKalma> interesting
[17:18:37] <smallville7123> yea, but if std::variant DID allow type punning then it would basically be a type-safe union, right?
[17:18:40] <PJBoy> float b[] does also create a lifetime

[18:11:54] <rpav> every compiler i've seen optimizes that and memcpy is basically a barrier notation to the compiler, as long as you don't also touch the original object
[18:12:18] *** Joins: ivii (~ivan@user/ivii)
[18:12:35] <LordKalma> yeah, compilers trim away memcopies

[18:16:19] <PJBoy> re type aliases for iterators
[18:16:21] <LordKalma> curiouslt enough, it didn't
[18:16:41] <PJBoy> you'd just write `using it_t = decltype(vec)::iterator;` or whatever
[18:16:49] <LordKalma> https://godbolt.org/z/xrbMfEvWM
[18:16:50] <LordKalma> clang does
[18:16:53] <LordKalma> :D win for clang
[18:16:54] <PJBoy> doesn't need to be a non-local typedef
[18:17:16] <smallville7123> why doesnt std have a std::union type ?
[18:17:42] <LordKalma> PJBoy, see? clang good :D
[18:17:51] <smallville7123> that is similar to std::variant except it is type punnable and retains the same qualities as a C/C++ union
[18:18:20] <PJBoy> yeah clang's real good
[18:18:22] <LordKalma> because C++'s object model's whole point is to NOT do that
[18:18:26] <PJBoy> it has great potential
[18:18:35] <smallville7123> rip
[18:19:01] <LordKalma> you can't just type pun in C++,. you have to handle lifetime rules
[18:19:23] <PJBoy> you can type pun with memcpy / bit_cast
[18:19:32] <LordKalma> because they handle lifetime :)
[18:19:52] <PJBoy> we just don't want to allow aliasing of differently typed objects
[18:20:01] <LordKalma> true
[18:20:23] <PJBoy> so if you memcpy, then that's not aliasing anymore, and we'r ehappy
[18:20:49] <LordKalma> and even without thinking about strict aliasing, with the C++'s object model, how would you define lifetime in a union where type punning is allowed? thtey all live the whole lifetime of the union?

[18:20:59] <LordKalma> they, all the union types
[18:21:56] <PJBoy> yeah you'd just allow all objects to be alive, limit them to implicit lifetime types, and disallow optimisations based on knowing the type
[18:22:04] <smallville7123> basically it should only allow type punning of primative types
[18:22:11] *** Joins: JohnMS_WORK (~kvirc@89-64-70-205.dynamic.chello.pl)

[18:23:16] <PJBoy> C is fake code
[18:23:16] <smallville7123> which IS real code :)
[18:23:19] <smallville7123> oof
[18:23:27] <LordKalma> pffff
[18:23:43] <LordKalma> C needs to do that kind of shit because C has no idioms to actually write expressive coe
[18:23:49] <LordKalma> *code
[18:23:55] <PJBoy> ideally you'd just bit_cast and it would be even simpler
[18:25:10] <smallville7123> :)
[18:25:22] <LordKalma> I've seen unions in C used as "polymorphism"
[18:25:34] <LordKalma> just union a couple structs because only one of them will be needed, and put an if in there
[18:25:47] <PJBoy> `auto uxi = bit_cast<uint64_t>(x) & -1ull>>1;`
[18:26:33] <LordKalma> I love it. C programmers loves to shit on C++ to then just implement the same features but worse

[23:31:07] <rpav> static_cast is so long to type; as_s<T> / as_u<T> with deduction
[23:31:44] <TinoDidriksen> The minimum is -Wall -Wextra and fix all warnings, or selectively disable ones you know are superfluous in your codebase. But -Wall -Wextra is a very good basis.

[23:33:45] <rpav> -Werror=return-type should be soemthing everyone uses as it's always a crash error
[23:34:20] <rpav> unless your code is so convoluted the compiler can't tell (something i've not actually run into), in which case make your code clearer
[23:35:54] <TinoDidriksen> Ah, -Wsign-compare is part of -Wall -Wextra; you're right that -Wsign-conversion is not.
[23:37:09] <TinoDidriksen> I wonder if that's old enough now to be widely usable. It's gone through a few names.
[23:38:09] <TinoDidriksen> Oh, no, that was the -Wcoercion to -Wconversion thing.
[23:39:29] <PJBoy> problem with -Werror=return-type is that it'll trigger on exhaustive switch cases
[23:40:45] <PJBoy> and std::unreachable() is C++23

[23:47:26] <rpav> exhaustive switch cases?
[23:47:56] <PJBoy> yeah like `int f(int x) { switch (x) { case 0: return 0; case 1: return 1; ... } }`
[23:48:01] <rpav> it has not triggered on cases where i've had every available enum value
[23:48:02] <PJBoy> where you cover all the cases
[23:48:13] <rpav> and you can always toss a return {}; at the end if it does
[23:49:16] <PJBoy> https://godbolt.org/z/6vsMM1n8Y for enum example

[23:49:57] <rpav> that's not an example
[23:50:09] <PJBoy> you could add a return at the end, but then you might get a dead code warning
[23:51:30] <rpav> or maybe gcc just sucks
[23:52:30] <rpav> looks like gcc just sucks
[23:52:36] <PJBoy> Werror bad in any case
[23:52:46] <rpav> gcc bad in any case
[23:52:52] <PJBoy> just acknowledge your warnings
[23:53:19] <PJBoy> and then you don't have to rebuild just because of some stupid warning
[23:53:21] <rpav> yeah it's easy to miss warnings if they scroll by in thousands of files building
[23:53:42] <rpav> and anyway if you must you can add a return {}; at the end and gcc will be fine
[23:53:49] <PJBoy> disable your warnings if you don't care enough to fix them
[23:54:05] <rpav> yeah easy to say if you're dealing with trivial code and not a bunch of 3rd party stuff
[23:54:20] <PJBoy> disregard third party warnings
[23:54:39] <rpav> i agree code should be warning-free but getting it as such is not always practical, and return-type is a _very_ specifically bad thing
[23:54:49] <rpav> even the name is terrible ;)
[23:55:06] <rpav> (another way to avoid such is using default:)
[23:55:21] <PJBoy> but using default cripples other warnings
[23:55:25] *** kenanmarasli_ is now known as kenanmarasli
[23:55:26] <PJBoy> like unused enum cases
[23:55:32] <PJBoy> unwritten rather
[23:55:49] <rpav> moral: avoid gcc
[23:56:02] <PJBoy> now who's being unpractical :p
[23:56:20] <PJBoy> in 2030 clang's still gonna be stuck on C++17
[23:56:23] <rpav> well the reality is you can easily fix such cases even with gcc
[23:57:10] <rpav> and if you must gcc has an unreachable builtin you can #define something for in extreme and unusual cases
[23:57:18] <PJBoy> you can easily fix the warning yeah, it just sucks that you have to rebuild
[23:57:27] <rpav> rebuild?
[23:57:30] <rpav> what do you have to rebuild?
[23:57:36] <PJBoy> because you made the warning an error
[23:57:39] <PJBoy> so your build stops
[23:57:43] <rpav> you had a literal error in your code, you _needed_ to rebuild
[23:57:56] <PJBoy> there's no error in the godbolt I wrote
[23:58:10] <PJBoy> and even if there was, it might not be relevant to the code I'm testing
[23:58:17] <rpav> yeah and it's a highly contrived case you will almost never run into, and boo hoo if you do and have to recompile an entire file :p
[23:58:20] <rpav> do you even write C++
[23:58:49] <PJBoy> if it's in a header then it'll trigger more than a single file recompile
[23:59:24] <PJBoy> etc.
[23:59:33] <rpav> this is the idiotic attitude that infects too much of C++ already .. "there _MIGHT_ be this _ONE_ highly unusual case that you'll almost never run into, but hypothetically you might, so let's make things less useful and more error prone just in case so you can avoid having to do some trivial amount of work in the improbable case you encounter it"
[23:59:37] <PJBoy> it's not the slightest bit contrived
[23:59:46] <PJBoy> it's the only time you'll ever run into this warning in practice
[23:59:53] <fiesh> of course gcc handles the switch case correctly
[23:59:58] <fiesh> you just need to add -fstrict-enums
