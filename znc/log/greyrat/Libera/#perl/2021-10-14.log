[05:21:41] <ology> grrr
[05:22:35] <genio> you define a variable and then you assign it a value (without delving too far in depth).
[05:23:39] <genio> my $foo;    <-- a variable has been defined (declared). Its value is not yet known and could be many things.        $foo = 123;  <-- that variable has been assigned the value 123
[05:23:48] <genio> my $foo = 123;     <-- both steps combined
[05:24:07] <genio> At this point, a tutorial would be your best help
[05:24:09] <xenu> "beginning perl" by curtis poe is probably the best choice for someone who isn't a programmer

[17:00:09] <simcop2387> does that support automatically setting up stuff for the dns challenges with cloudflare dns?

[17:08:15] * Botje uploads an Acme::Mojo to be contrarian
[17:08:19] * ilmari uses acme-tiny, but that doesn't have any integration, you just give it a CSR and it drops the HTTP challenge files in a directory and prints the cert on stdout
[17:09:06] <ilmari> so have a tiny shell script around it in a cronjob
[17:09:08] <ilmari> +I
[17:09:12] <tirnanog> yeah, that lack of integration is exactly why I like it.
[17:09:33] <tirnanog> it does the one job I wanted such a utility to do, and well.

[17:21:06] <Altreus> except for launching the things not done in shell
[17:21:11] <tirnanog> mst: well, yeah. it's just that I'd rather have under 200 lines of easily auditable code that uses well implemented and tested http/json/etc libraries that a thousands of lines of dodgy looking shell code that also demands to have access to my private keys and wants to meddle with my nginx configs.
[17:21:37] <tirnanog> even if it's ~200 lines of a language that is not my favourite.

[17:21:49] <mst> I mean were I trying to do this in shell

[17:25:21] <merpaderp> same for nginx
[17:25:21] <merpaderp> idk
[17:25:47] <merpaderp> it works and gets out of my way to install python modules, which I am eternally glad, because on gentoo thats pain, it has multiple python versions
[17:25:54] <tirnanog> well, whatever. I don't want it even having read access to my webserver configs, let alone demanding to be able to write out keys and certificate bundles. to each their own.
[17:26:00] <tirnanog> and the code just looks bad.
[17:26:12] <merpaderp> okay, so certbot is better in that regard/

[17:27:28] <tirnanog> acme-tiny only needs the account key and the csr. I instrument the rest myself, as ilmari does. it's pretty simple. my one nit with it is that it doesn't support DNS-01 challenges, though there's a (slightly larger) fork that does.
[17:29:01] <Grinnz> acme-tiny++
[17:29:47] <ilmari> tirnanog: it doesn't have access to anything, I've just configured nginx to alias /.well-known/acme-challenge/ to the --acme-dir I specify on the acme-tiny command line

[17:30:30] <tirnanog> merpaderp: as for gentoo, acme-tiny should always JustWork(tm) as long as you don't do anything 'interesting'. especially now that portage queues updates for python-exec.conf when the default implementation changes.
[17:32:11] <tirnanog> ilmari: right.
[17:35:12] <tirnanog> merpaderp: even before that change, one could simply leave python-exec.conf blank and it would default to the latest installed implementation, which is appropriate for an overwhelming majority of gentoo users. at least, the kind that tend to turn up in their channel asking for help with such matters.
[17:36:06] <mst> "set defaults so they minimise the number of times you're asked about them on IRC" is a pretty good way to optimise for newbie ease of use
[17:40:22] <pragma-> nonsense. set the most restrictive defaults so the user has to go through each setting one-by-one to become familiar with your tool. once they go through the entire config file they will be an expert in your software and they won't have any questions!

[19:22:28] <simcop2387> zgu: yea mine is a set of things that manages the .well-known/ http stuff, and i'm going to switch entirely to dns so that i can simplify my webserver configs (there's a number of annoying setups to make it work on top of things like nextcloud et al that also use .well-known and serve it up dynamically
[19:23:06] <thrig> DNS also helps avoid "exposing internal servers to the webs" problem
[19:23:12] <zgu> yeah
[19:23:44] <simcop2387> yea, once i get this setup then i'm likely going to also set it up to get a bunch of certs for internal services that aren't exposed to the web too.  it'll be nice to have those have valid certs at the same time
[19:23:49] <zgu> i don't think i could do my freeradius cert with http validation
[19:23:57] <thrig> because a zero-day is exactly what the internal build server needs

[19:27:17] <simcop2387> mst: yea that's one of the really fun things that'll simplify my current setup.  perl.bot gets the usual issues because i have {f,freenode,m,magnet,o,oftc,l,libera,...}.{perl.bot,perlbot.pl,perlbot.simcop2387.info,...} all on one cert to simplify the webserver config, but getting a wildcard will be so much nicer

[22:17:54] <digdilem> ^ very true. 
[22:18:49] <Grinnz> the all four ways red is commonly because of crosswalks, but there is a light here that will have a green arrow one direction while nobody is there for an inordinate amount of time, right next to the police station
[22:19:05] <Grinnz> so it seems like everyone's red, but it's just that
[22:19:10] <gordonfish> Grinnz: Right. But over the past decade or more it seems to have gotten much worse, as if to frustrate drivers into running a light. At least that's how it feels.
[22:19:48] <gordonfish> Grinnz: Yes it can be due to crosswalks, but the cases I'm thinking of is when no one is around, no cars nor people.
[22:19:52] <Grinnz> the particular setup you mentioned is clearly misconfigured

[22:40:01] <choroba> What I remember from Lancaster is roadworks. They were everywhere.
[22:41:26] <mst> choroba: they tend to do them in bursts, no I don't know why
[22:42:02] <mst> also lol at me completely missing the perlqa that shadowcat fucking hosted

[22:43:45] <mst> but it was a fri/sat/sun thing and I'd flown back from stateside on the thursday having found out my father had died during the preceeding night, so I really wasn't fucking presentable psychologically at the time
[22:46:46] <gordonfish> mst: Sorry to hear that. My condolences. I know how that can mess one up.
[22:47:15] <mst> that was 2013, it's now just another bit of history
[22:47:41] <choroba> My visit to Lancaster was in 2003, IIRC
[22:47:46] <mst> ohh, ok
[22:48:07] <mst> I was already here but will have had no idea who you were yet then
[22:48:51] <choroba> I had no idea who I would be, either :)
[22:49:11] <mst> gordonfish: but had I attended I'm pretty sure I'd've achieved zero actual code and been extremely likely to lose my temper in a way that would've been fucking stupid even by -my- standards

[22:52:43] <mst> choroba: still, though, I've considered this place home since summer 2000, any time I've moved somewhere else it was still home more than anywhere else (my parents' place included) was
[22:53:36] <choroba> I can understand that
[22:54:51] <mst> relaxed, walkable, decent beer, annual music festival, etc. etc.
[22:55:32] <mst> could probably have made a lot more money over the years if mdk and I had founded shadowcat in london instead but we didn't want to ;)

[23:50:10] <vanfanel64> ack question. Instead of trying to guess how many lines to give -B/-A/-C is there a way to say show every line between the one matching pattern FOO and the one matching pattern BAR? Something like this would be nice.

[23:50:45] <vanfanel64> Something like that would be nice. Is there anything at all like that I am not seeing ?
