[00:36:01] <afidegnum> *buffer
[00:36:10] <dale> afidegnum: I'm not sure what a "child window" is, if such a concept exists.  There is a tree of splits but I don't typically see one window being made a "child" of another.
[00:37:37] <afidegnum> i.e a file browser where the left windows contains the list of files, when clicked, the right windows/buffer will load the contents of the clicked file
[00:37:40] <dale> E.g. I think the way treemacs works is that it has either a hook somewhere or, probably more likely, a timer that notices when the active window has changed, which causes it to change the contents of the treemacs window.

[01:33:04] <tusko> Is there something in emacs that can give suggestions for C?
[01:33:19] <tusko> Like if I tap Tab it will look inside a struct for me
[01:33:56] <dale> tusko: LSP might do this.
[01:33:59] <corwin> I think the general idea has to do with generating TAGs and then completing from those.
[01:34:17] <corwin> LSP would be another approach
[01:34:50] <earthToAdam> tusk maybe Company mode?
[01:35:16] <dale> tusko: Huh, does clangd really only do C++, not C?
[01:36:00] <tusko> clangd does seem to be complaining about autocomplete
[01:36:05] <dale> https://langserver.org/ says clangd and ccls both support C.
[01:36:17] <corwin> Maybe company with company-ctags?
[01:36:36] <dale> Yeah, you could go the ctags route, or I think GNU Global can help.
[01:36:59] <dale> Personally I'd go for lsp-mode first these days, which I have recently done with C++.
[01:37:10] <earthToAdam> tusko here you go https://company-mode.github.io/ and here's a blog post about setting it up for C/C++ http://cachestocaches.com/2015/8/c-completion-emacs/
[01:38:08] <tusko> Thanks
[01:38:23] <tusko> dale, I'm in C/*la mode is that the same thing?
[01:38:40] <dale> tusko: I think that just tells me you're in some form of cc-mode.
[01:38:50] <spikemaster> Unicorn_Princess: if you need to preserve the indentation exactly you could modify the fn to avoid calling #'indent-region. Maybe split on newline character "\n" of the copied text, loop over the strings, insert indentation to match previous line, then do a raw (insert str).
[01:39:09] <dale> tusko: lsp-mode is a separate package you have to install.  https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/installation/
[01:39:46] <dale> You will then need to install a language server, ccls or clangd are your best bets IMHO.

You can imagine this open struct buffer as a "completion popup" window, in a hand-wavy sort of way. Then back in your calling code you can use M-/ completion to assist with typing the struct names.

[04:19:21] <lagash> So I have this really annoying bug in Emacspeak. Essentially I'm trying to input, say, German or French, and so naturally I'm using input-method's & Quail. It works fine, except Emacspeak is apparently speaking out "key dash sequence" literally every time I try inputting an accented character. I suspect it's reading that from the echo area, because I cannot see anything in the messages buffer. So how do I do something similar to
[04:19:22] <lagash> debug-on-message but for the echo area? Or at least disable this annoying feature? I've set input-method-verbose-flag to nil and it took care of some stuff, but not everything.

[05:42:35] <Unicorn_Princess> something wacky is definitely going on. i just (setq standard-indent 4), but it had no effect on the formatting. of course iirc the lsp server needs a restart to update its settings, so question is how do i correctly feed it the right settings...

[05:43:44] <bremner> oh lsp for haskell, interesting.
[05:44:03] <Unicorn_Princess> let me try this way: in spacemacs, in dotspacemacs-configuration-layers, where you enable layers, one can specify variables for a layer, e.g. (haskell :variables haskell-completion-backend 'lsp)
[05:44:04] * bremner uses regular haskell-mode, and that rarely these days
[05:44:32] <Unicorn_Princess> how do i find which variables are valid to stick in that :variables list?
[05:45:11] <bremner> alas, that looks spacemacs specific

[05:50:52] <Unicorn_Princess> seems it was dtrt-indent that was setting standard-indent to 2. but now that i've disabled it and standard-indent remains 4 in haskell-mode... lsp--format-region still uses 2-space indent :/

[05:51:59] <twb> that DependsTM

[17:29:05] <rpav> there are things at times emacs has been terrible at
[17:29:16] <Common-Lisp> When I started my current job I spent two days writing Emacs versions of all the custom Atom plugins everyone else on my team had, and then moved on with my life xD
[17:29:26] <rpav> there probably still are, i just don't do them myself
[17:29:31] <blacked> i feel superior
[17:29:38] <blacked> i feel cool internet guy.
[17:29:40] <Common-Lisp> rpav: hmm, like what?
[17:29:50] <rpav> Common-Lisp: it was horrible at c++ for a long time
[17:30:03] <Common-Lisp> not so much anymore.
[17:30:14] <Common-Lisp> LLD really changed the game on that front
[17:30:32] <rpav> only because lsp and clang-format stuff were able to basically make most of the editor stuff irrelevant, which isn't really a win in emacs's book
[17:30:59] <Common-Lisp> It is, from a certain point of view
[17:31:10] <rpav> and i mean cc-mode stuff is still pretty terrible afaict, but then again languages should probably mostly drive their own parsing and comprehension
[17:31:39] <rpav> Common-Lisp: well, it makes emacs useful for those things, but it's just as big a win for every other editor supporting lsp
[17:32:13] <Common-Lisp> rpav: Sure, but feature parity in one area is still Emacs winning, because of superior features in other areas
[17:32:14] <rpav> basically, something microsoft invented for visual studio code happens to be generalized enough emacs can use it; this isn't really a "look how good emacs is" kind of win ;)
[17:32:49] <Common-Lisp> at the end of the day Emacs is still a better system for C++ than VSC is, because of "Feature parity in language support" + all the other benefits of Emacs vs VSC still being relevant
[17:32:51] <corwin> yey, eli patched up image mode so now dungeon-mode SVG drawing works again on the release branch
[17:33:04] <rpav> eh arguable
[17:33:21] <rpav> vsc still has a vastly superior debugger, which is to say basically anything at all that's not super clunk

[18:01:43] <s-liao> Mostly the reason you debug into the source is that understand what the procure behavior are in particular environment. NOT the program of control flow.
[18:03:00] <Common-Lisp> Yeah, for stuff like that recently I've moved to just making that information available at runtime by default, without bringing a debugger into the mix
[18:03:01] <rpav> my understanding is people doing low-level operations usually involving "poke and peek at hardware bytes" tend to use stepping more
[18:03:03] <s-liao> Mostly the reason you debug into the source is that understand what the procedure behavior are in particular environment. NOT the program of control flow.

[18:04:14] <rpav> or say, VS, which when you run code, always runs it in the debugger, without some extra steps
[18:04:26] <Common-Lisp> rpav: I guess that depends on your definition of debugger. For CL, sure. For Erlang, I'm not sure if querying server state really counts as "a debugger"
[18:04:54] <rpav> it probably also depends on the exact information you want available and how
[18:05:00] <Common-Lisp> True.
[18:05:29] <rpav> stop-execution-and-check (at least, resumably) is basically "you have a debugger" however that is
[18:06:29] <rpav> but, having nice editor integration is nice
[18:06:57] <rpav> emacs could really use something that doesn't take over and mess up all the window/frame configuration just to show where code breaks when it does
