[00:00:29] <tirnanog> MrBurns: one solution would be to build an associtative array whose keys are the names and whose values are empty. then you can simply check whether the key is defined.

[03:41:22] <bouuuuuuuuuwnd> hello, i am experiencing strange problems with my 4x4 gb ram setup on an older machine running fedora 35 workstation. i noticed that instead of 16gb only 8 were recognized so i put each of the 4 modules in the first slot to test whether it gets recognized. one module seemed faulty and i couldnt boot with it. then i put 2 of the 3 remaining ones back in and bios reported 8 gb but fedora only finds 4gb and lshw

[04:56:55] <DiffieHellman> The solution to NAT's is to just use IPv6 tbh.
[04:57:26] <Andrew> *memorizes his IPv6 address*
[04:57:34] <DVsx> whats is about authentication?
[04:57:56] <DVsx> i mean that's how is dangerous and hacker abuse it
[04:58:04] <DiffieHellman> Andrew: It's almost like something called a domain name or something in /etc/hosts. You should not be memorising IPv4 addresses either.
[04:58:07] <ayecee> there is no authentication
[04:58:14] <Andrew> DiffieHellman: lol yeah
[04:58:27] <Andrew> I'm just too lazy to set up my own DNS server
[04:58:33] <Andrew> (Too many devices)
[04:58:40] <ayecee> the authentication is being on the network
[04:58:56] <Andrew> If crackers are already in your network, you have more to worry about.
[04:59:02] <DiffieHellman> DVsx: Upnp has no authentication, any program can use it. Any cracker that can make a Upnp request, can open up a port so they can connect easy.
[04:59:08] <ayecee> crumbs everywhere
[04:59:21] <DiffieHellman> This really just demonstrates that NAT is not a firewall and you should be using IPv6 and a firewall
[04:59:21] <Andrew> And iirc a device can only request UPnP to that specific device

[05:08:51] <DiffieHellman> DVsx: Upnp requests need to originate from the client, but the router can forward ports to particular IP addresses instead

[05:22:06] <Jari--> Andrew :)
[05:23:02] <Andrew> Another solution: Don't use a consuuuumer router, use a computer with two network cards and use PPP from there, and set up routing tables
[05:23:25] <DiffieHellman> What?
[05:23:26] <Andrew> and basically use that computer for most things that goes to the Internet
[05:23:42] <Andrew> DiffieHellman: If you have a spare computer with two ethernet cards, you can make your own router

[08:52:17] <znf> I can never remember on what port $client set it to
[08:52:17] <rascul> changing the ssh port is a not an option in my book
[08:52:18] <DiffieHellman> I use port 22 and fail2ban, works fine.
[08:52:20] <bparker> no need for fail2anything
[08:52:24] <bindi> I plugged in a screen to my server and I'm expecting a tty, however the monitor says no signal detected
[08:52:28] <eventhorizon5> I have some AWS systems, and years ago I had to wait for fail2ban to introduce ipv6 support before enabling ipv6 on those systems, it literally all depended on fail2ban.

[08:52:34] <rbox> bindi: hit a key

[08:52:42] <Dan39> znf: why not set the host up in config so you don't have to type port then?
[08:53:00] <znf> Dan39, many times I ssh across different machines

[08:53:06] <Psi-Jack> Anyone that uses "port knocking" as a means for "security"... Just doesn't get it.
[08:53:09] <rascul> changing the ssh port only makes your logs smaller
[08:53:10] <bparker> DiffieHellman: that on top of port knocking is even better
[08:53:14] <rascul> and makes connecting more difficult
[08:53:14] <Psi-Jack> Sorry, but no.
[08:53:18] <bindi> rbox: it did boot with a monitor, and it doesn't boot without a cable (or a dummy plug, which is disconnected)
[08:53:21] <znf> ie: I jump from hostA to hostB and then maybe scp something from hostB to hostC
[08:53:39] <rascul> some clients don't even have the option to use non default port, or at least it's not easy to discover how
[08:53:39] <Dan39> i see
[08:53:40] <znf> it's simple to use a config when you do all your ssh-ing from a single machine
[08:53:43] <DiffieHellman> bparker: fail2ban gets rid of anyone filling up the logs
[08:53:55] <DiffieHellman> No port knocking needed

[08:54:06] <bindi> ctrl-alt+f6 "started getty on tty6" yet no signal
[08:54:26] <DiffieHellman> bparker: It's still impossible to defeat keyfiles without the key, but okay.
[08:54:32] <znf> Dan39, also, if you scp user@hostA:/file user@hostB:/file, you'll be in for a surprise with configs :P

[09:29:07] <DiffieHellman> rascul: You can add firefox to the OS's name if you feel like it; firefox/Linux for example. Just "Linux" is not a suitable name though

[09:29:46] <DiffieHellman> Yup, in this case, GNU/Linux is the OS, though GNU is an OS on it's own.
[09:29:56] <Andrew> In fact, i'd be okay with saying that "Debian" is the os, because it's the distro that combines those two.

[09:30:55] <eventhorizon5> Linux is an OS kernel, so is it an OS?  Yes, but not the full system.  If you call GNU the OS, then GNU should be able to be used without a kernel perfectly fine, since it's an OS.  The definitions just turn into mind games mostly.
[09:31:05] <DiffieHellman> Andrew: You could use TeXlive as an OS if you really wanted to.

[09:39:45] <Andrew> In computing, booting is the process of starting a computer. It can be initiated by hardware such as a button press, or by a software command. After it is switched on, a computer's central processing unit (CPU) has no software in its main memory, so some process must load software into memory before it can be executed.  This may be done by hardware or firmware in the CPU, or by a separate processor

[12:52:47] <scaramanga> the fact that a copyrightable work can be constructed as a side-effect of enumerating an infinite series is about as relevant as there being an un-murdered version of the victim in an alternate universe

[12:56:50] <scaramanga> from memory, the stallman argunment there is not saying intellectual property cannot have a definition, obviously it's just a term and can have any definition you like. but the way it's used in debate is often to try to confuse and conflate various concepts (copyright, trademarks, patents, etc) with something completely different, ie. chattel property or land, and it's that when you do that that arguments become incoherent.

[15:04:19] <gjvc> you can try restarting X
[15:04:21] <BCMM> i mean you *might* be able to unload the module and reload the module, but if the graphics hardware itself has got in a funny state, it may not help

[15:10:21] <BCMM> CapeTown77: note that you should create a new locale file (or more likely copy an existing one) rather than editing in place, so a system update doesn't replace your custom locale

[15:42:07] <BCMM> i reckon you pretty much have to measure it with something completely external to the computer
[15:43:03] <BCMM> to be honest i think the dumbest possible method is still hard to beat: point a camera at screen and keyboard, count frames between pressing key and result appearing on screen

[17:42:39] <BCMM> feep: if you just want to make sure they don't actually break in to your system, we already have ssh key pairs which basically does that perfectly. if you want them to stop sending pointless traffic to *try* to break in to your system, you can't. they just don't have any real incentive to stop bothering you even if it doesn't work for them.

[19:29:02] <ayecee> it doesn't have to be used. BCMM suggest presenting it as uncompressed text while keeping it internally as a gz

[19:29:13] <Blondie101010> it's just a file
[19:29:21] <Blondie101010> compress it or not...  doesn't matter
[19:29:31] <lacroix> ayecee, besides there's zcat and zgrep to check stuff without uncompressing it
[19:29:51] <hexnewbie> ..and it is kind of annoying that Debian chose not not expose /proc/config.gz, because you can no longer make certain what config you're *currently* running, because /boot/config-"$(uname -r)" is supposed to be a substitute, but it makes no guarantees if the kernel didn't get replaced or something

[20:23:40] <Lantizia> hexnewbie, never knew about that one - but cable modems weren't massively popular over here (except for only a couple of ISP's)
[20:23:40] <FIlstyn> git can do much more damage than rm ;-)
[20:23:55] <hexnewbie> akik: FIxed it. The on-screen keyboard for entering the password was hiding the gear button
[20:24:04] <Mathisen> FIlstyn, ?
[20:24:23] <akik> hexnewbie: i switched back to gdm and xfce wasn't starting again
[20:24:39] <jim> FIlstyn, yes, if you're not familiar with it, it can be a problem. one thing you can do, is backup your working dir (which contains your .git)
[20:25:10] <Lantizia> hexnewbie, best one (again back in the win98 days) was to Win+R and run 'fdisk /mbr' ... completed instantly with no errors or message... obviously didn't work on NT based windoze though
[20:25:20] <hexnewbie> Though I should say discovering the gear button in my case wasn't really useful, as GNOME on X turned out to be worse than GNOME on Wayland.
[20:25:39] <FIlstyn> I once erased my whole stuff after day of coding. Was so mad I stayed narly till next day light
[20:25:52] <FIlstyn> to rewrite it
[20:26:14] <Lantizia> anyway... WRAPPERS... if you you're wanting a few and a system for managing them - should I be looking at anything which exists and I'll shoot myself for not using when I inevitably find out about it later

[23:46:58] <Azrael_-> i try to set up a simple ftp server on debian 10 and tried pure-ftpd. added a user with "pure-pw useradd <username> -u <systemuser> -d <homedir>" and updated it with "pure-pw mkdb" but if i try to login i just get "530 Login authentication failed" and find no further information in the logs. any ideas or recommendations how to proceed? if you can suggest a different simple ftp-server i'm totally

[23:55:39] <rascul> maybe this ninja is what you meant   https://ninja-build.org/
[23:55:47] <rbox> i thought ninja uses its own files
[23:55:50] <rascul> i don't think it can read makefiles though
[23:55:52] <rbox> i need to read existing makefiles
[23:56:08] <Sauvin> j0s_soe, what's up?
[23:56:09] <hexnewbie> To be fair, setting up own users for sftp is more complicated than an FTP server out of the box. I had to create a symlink to sshd under a different name to change the name of the PAM config in which I added users for sftp
[23:56:11] <rbox> what i really want... is to be able to modify a makefile after it's been read, but before it's been parsed
[23:56:14] <rbox> if that makes sense
[23:56:25] <mrfb> rascul: yes

[23:57:58] <rascul> rbox just use gdb
[23:58:03] <hexnewbie> Since apparently argv[0] is how sshd decides which PAM service name to use. I guess systemd allows you to use ExecStart=@/usr/sbin/sshd sshd-sftp ... but I didn't know that back then

[23:59:06] <hexnewbie> sftp ≠ scp
