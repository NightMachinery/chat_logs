[01:44:55] <DosAmp> any encrypted partitioning that only protects user data (/etc, /home, /var) sadly makes unlocking necessary so early into boot that you might as well encrypt the whole root filesystem

[01:46:41] <jonascj> DosAmp If not for the GRUB 2 / LUKS2 incompatiblity I would have encrypted / and /boot, now I contemplate just encrypting / (everything apart from /boot)
[01:47:37] <jonascj> since encryption of /boot seems to offer little extra when used without secure boot etc.
[01:48:52] <DosAmp> my pretty whack solution for a cold storage device I can lock away physically is LUKS1 for /boot and just a key file for root in initramfs
[01:49:54] *** Joins: rodolfo (~rodolfo@user/rodolfo)
[01:52:20] <jonascj> DosAmp the key file is just to avoid having to type in your encryption pass phrase twice, right? You type to unluck /boot (luks1), which decrypts initramfs containing the key(file) to / (luks2)
[01:53:11] <DosAmp> yeah
[01:53:26] <DosAmp> together with a GRUB and BIOS password that's good enough for me
[01:55:54] <DosAmp> you could also add dm-verity to /boot for some protection against funky bit flipping

[04:20:33] <Namarrgon> hwrd: which package exactly?
[04:20:46] <mystiquewolf> So i have downloaded all PKGBUILDS for the affected apps and built the first of them (khelpcenter)
[04:21:01] <Namarrgon> yes
[04:21:08] <mystiquewolf> Was going to build the other ones too (total 5 or 6 packages)
[04:21:41] <mystiquewolf> but decided after building the first package to click the reload button to see if the list of files without symbols in Dr. Konqi will decrease by one
[04:22:20] <mystiquewolf> That's what i sometimes did in Kubuntu too after installing some of the *-dbgsym packages and it worked there
[04:23:18] <mystiquewolf> But now when i clicked "Reload" in Dr. Konqi my previous backtrace was replaced with a different one in the same Dr. Konqi window, this time it says "Segmentation fault"
[04:23:49] <hwrd> Namarrgon pgcli seems to need libffi7. I think I mentioned both of those in my original message, unless you're asking something I'm not understanding?

[04:31:33] <Namarrgon> you have to rebuild all your unofficial packages whos libs get so-bumped
[04:32:36] <Namarrgon> as far as i can see only python-pgspecial and python-cli_helpers are from the AUR, rebuild those and then try pgcli again

[20:05:53] <jleechpe> I'm having issues booting/debugging my system. It had been working fine for months and today (after upgrading RAM) it no longer finishes the boot process.  It gets to "Reached target Sound Card" then the screen goes blank (resets) and the plugged in usb keyboard stops responding (numlock doesn't toggle LED even when in different ports.  I've tried with a live USB and I get the same behaviour, it starts to load then flickers and
[20:05:53] <jleechpe>  the USB keyboard goes dead
