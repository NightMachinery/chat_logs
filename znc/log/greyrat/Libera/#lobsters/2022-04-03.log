[21:13:50] <mocx> jtm my approach to a technical interview is to try and reduce anxiety. I usually rip the badaid off about how the interview will go. Then I keep the problem simple. Level 2/3 developer should be able to talk about and write pseudocode around an elevator or microwave, but L3 should be able to lead some of the discussion and should be familiar with primary language (c,php,js, whatever) constructs. T
[21:13:51] <mocx> hen ask them the code. If they cant do it, then that is too bad. If they express self doubt, then I try to give them advice on improvement: “Codewars” or “aim to discuss the problem rather than worry about algorithms and loops”

[21:21:31] <jtm> I'm currently in the process of interviewing, and just bombed a phone screening where I had to write itoa() ... :(
[21:22:24] <jtm> I have a fair amount of experience.. it's so frustrating when the nerves get to you and a simple problem becomes hard

[21:27:14] <jj5> the trick is not to get upset. even if you feel you're bombing it.
[21:28:16] <lep> i always wonder when i read about these interviews how i would do in them
[21:28:32] <lep> they seem quite strange from afar
[21:28:50] <jj5> lep: it's instructive to take a few interviews to see what it's like. I haven't done many myself.
