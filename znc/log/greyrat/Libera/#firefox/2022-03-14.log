[00:37:53] <ede> another odd thing… installed noscript into my still(!) temporary profile, played a bit with it, checked the configs, removed all the default trusted sites. everything fine.
[00:38:41] <ede> started allowing whatever was needed to work, including google. i'm usually fine with its static version. but now i did a search in a tab and it looked weird, no css.
[00:39:38] <ede> sent the tab home, and surprise... even here no css. googled in another tab, all fine. i remember there's something tab specific, but not sure if there's a "block everything it this tab".
[00:40:04] <ede> but even then, about:home is privileged, so blocking css here should not even work?

[09:56:14] <solrize> i got it to work for another site that i found
[09:56:43] <solrize> but now it just hangs for the site i'm trying to snapshot
[09:59:54] <susi> try running without --headless, just --screenshot (implies --headless)
[10:01:08] <solrize> thanks, same thing, hangs and i ^C out and it says "exiting due to channel error".  the actual site shows some kind fo spinner for a fairly long time
[10:01:18] <solrize> firefox -screenshot cdc.png https://tinyurl.com/abcasdfasdfsda
[10:01:25] <solrize> it's a cdc covid page
[10:02:36] <solrize> maybe it is looking for scroll events or something, since the part i want is in the bottom of the page... so i have to program it with selenium or something?  ugh
[10:03:15] <solrize> the error i was getting earlier was "[GFX1-]: RenderCompositorSWGL failed mapping default framebuffer, no dt
[10:03:15] <solrize> "
[10:03:26] <solrize> oops that was the error i was getting earlier
[10:05:35] <susi> that tinyurl does not load for me
[10:05:41] <susi> or that cdc.gov it points to
[10:05:55] <susi> We can’t connect to the server at covid.cdc.gov.
[10:06:13] <solrize> weird, wonder what is up, i just loaded it ok
[10:06:14] <solrize> https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view?list_select_state=all_states&list_select_county=all_counties&data-type=Risk&null=Risk
[10:06:32] <solrize> i can set up a proxy or capture the html if that helps
[10:06:42] <susi> that works
[10:06:51] <susi> now it loads :)
[10:06:59] <solrize> hmm
[10:08:32] <solrize> i'm trying to get a gif of the community spread map near the bottom if you scroll way down... they show it as a monstrous svg.  maybe i can extract that and render it somehow
[10:11:32] <susi> I'd rather get svg and render it with something
[10:12:06] <Caspy7[m]> when you say gif, you mean animation or just an image?
[10:13:15] <solrize> just an image, it changes once per day, i don't need the thing where you float over individual counties
[10:14:56] <Caspy7[m]> don't suppose you know how to make it "click" on the download button
[10:15:03] <Caspy7[m]> (I sure don't)
[10:16:32] <solrize> maybe with selenium?  or maybe i can figure out what the button does and simulate it
[10:17:00] <solrize> hmm i don't even see the button in the retrieved html
[10:17:44] <solrize> anyway i'll look into rendering svg

[13:35:21] <Emmanuel_Chanel> Hello! Does Firefix recognize the form like chg:Emmanuel_Chanel ? It doesn't work on a CGI web board. It can be the board's bug, too, though.
[13:36:09] <Cork> Emmanuel_Chanel: what form are you talking about?
[13:36:56] <Cork> cause no, that isn't a standard syntax for anything i've seen so it has to be implemented in server or javascript to work
[13:38:27] <Emmanuel_Chanel> Like the forms on HTML pages of CGI: <input type="text" name="pwd:$id" size="20">
[13:38:39] <Cork> thats just a string
[13:38:55] <Cork> it can be anything, firefox has no reference to what it meanst more then "field name"
[13:41:08] <Emmanuel_Chanel> I consult the web board's support forum. And one answers me: : is decoded to %3A
[13:41:22] <Emmanuel_Chanel> And they teach me how can I fix.
[13:41:28] <Emmanuel_Chanel> Thanks for answering me here!
[13:43:19] <zenobit> hello Is there some extensions or functions which let me  open only one tab per page (if you try open new tab with already opened page it will automatically open this tab instead)

[22:00:46] <jensen> i want firefox to use gtk dark theme for the UI but NOT for the webpages. layout.css.prefers-color-scheme.content-override setting makes webpages use light theme again, but Tree Style Tab will also use light theme. Should Tree Style Tab also use dark theme and is this possible?

I have been using firefox for fifteen years now. I already spent time too much time configuring vim and thunderbird.

[22:45:32] <cassepipe> susi: Thanks
[22:45:42] <susi> so you'd add something like "text/xml": { "action": 1, "extensions": [ "txt" ] } in your handlers.json
[22:46:05] <susi> whatever you were trying to do
