[02:01:39] <matsaman> there's things they can get away with, like iCloud
[02:01:58] <sheetjs> matsaman: this general critique can be applied to the economy as a whole
[02:02:07] <matsaman> no doubt
[02:02:18] <sheetjs> "America Is Running on Fumes" https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/12/america-innovation-film-science-business/620858/
[02:02:21] <matsaman> so much of our economy is dine & dash
[02:03:02] <sheetjs> the rise of saas and the shift to software rentals led to a general decline in quality
[02:03:23] <sheetjs> the theoretical argument is "why bother innovating when your audience is captive?"
[02:04:15] <matsaman> yes and I've heard it argued that this has happened many times in history before when a middle class has become _so comfortable_ that they lose their fucking minds at the idea of receding a millimetre back down
[02:04:42] <sheetjs> specific to javascript
[02:04:54] <matsaman> "one more immigrant and I'll have to return my 5K TV for a 4.9K one! NOPE!"
[02:05:16] <sheetjs> there was a time when browsers started rapidly adding features without too much forethought
[02:05:29] <matsaman> feel like we're in that time again, heh
[02:05:32] <matsaman> but I know what you mean
[02:05:32] <ljharb> it's pretty sustainable
[02:05:47] <matsaman> if you're able to change what you're selling, for sure
[02:05:55] <ljharb> matsaman: PWAs and service workers are crappy tech tho
[02:06:09] <matsaman> it's certainly sustainable enough for early investors to get rich
[02:06:19] <ljharb> google's PWA team spent a year working with airbnb to make service workers "not significantly slower" than not having service workers, and failed
[02:06:27] <ljharb> in chrome, mind you
[02:06:37] <matsaman> I'm not invested in PWA, it's just an example of something that can be not-native that Apple for the moment mysteriously doesn't disallow
[02:06:40] <sheetjs> so when indexeddb was posited as an alternative to websql, it was argued that people would build SQL wrappers
[02:06:50] <ljharb> matsaman: it's not mysterious
[02:07:01] <matsaman> it's not incredibly mysterious
[02:07:06] <ljharb> it's that many of these things aren't actually standards, they're just google abusing their monopoly to force things in
[02:07:24] <matsaman> again that's PWA specifically
[02:07:30] <matsaman> which was just an example
[02:07:34] <ljharb> matsaman: it's also many other things specifically
[02:07:43] <matsaman> Apple doesn't want apps that aren't in their store, that's what I was saying
[02:07:53] <ljharb> well sure. but if you look at only the fully standard things that apple doesn't implement, it's still very very few.

[02:17:33] <Maxdamantus> Spidermonkey has always had a fairly usable API. I'm not sure about API stability though. From what I remember back in 2009 or so when I used it, the Spidermonkey API added breaking changes fairly frequently.
[02:17:51] <ljharb> i said ABI not API
[02:17:54] <Maxdamantus> I imagine in terms of browsers, Chrome has probably been the least extensible.
[02:17:57] <sheetjs> ease of embedding was not really a design goal for spidermonkey in the same way it was for v8 (which is not to say v8 embedding is a cakewalk)
[02:18:12] <sheetjs> duktape and some of the newer lightweight engines are great
[02:18:33] <Maxdamantus> Firefox used to essentially be XULRunner + some dynamic code on top of that, so it was quite extensible from the bottom up.
[02:18:51] *** Quits: mohab (~mohab@45.243.59.56) (Quit: WeeChat 3.3)
[02:19:19] <Maxdamantus> They recently changed that, so it's as unextensible as Chrome (both in extensions and in being able to make alternative browsers on top of the same engine).

[02:20:44] <Maxdamantus> Not sure what the significance of ABI vs API is. If the ABI changes but the API is the same, you can just recompile your code, no development effort needed.
[02:21:23] <matsaman> what was spidermonkey originally written in?
[02:21:31] <Maxdamantus> C.
[02:21:50] <Maxdamantus> Then gradually parts of it were written in C++.
[02:21:56] <Maxdamantus> back in 2009 the API was all C.
[02:22:12] <Maxdamantus> (though I think it was largely implemented in C++ at that time)
[02:22:13] <matsaman> mmm

[02:22:51] <Maxdamantus> (haven't looked at the API since then, dunno if they've added special C++ support or removed C support)
[02:22:54] <matsaman> dunno, I feel like if Dahl had formulated a real opinion on the matter, he would've stated it, but he's a weird dude so who knows
[02:23:13] <ljharb> also his opinions shift a lot over time
[02:23:18] <Maxdamantus> I think Node was just the winner out of a number of similar frojects.
[02:23:20] <Maxdamantus> projects*
[02:23:25] <matsaman> ljharb: heh, clearly
[02:23:26] <ljharb> what was similar at the time?
[02:23:33] <ljharb> rhino was crap long before node existed
[02:23:45] <Maxdamantus> There were a bunch of them. Rhino is not one, Rhino is a Java implementation of JS.
[02:23:48] <matsaman> I'm still going to bet on 2009 being closer to 2008 than 1995, popularity, and licensing, but =)
[02:24:00] <Maxdamantus> one that comes to mind was called something like "flussperfd", but there were others.
[02:24:07] <Maxdamantus> some based on V8, some based on Spidermonkey.
[02:24:11] * matsaman tries to remember original discussion topic
[02:24:51] <ljharb> tbh never heard of it, or any other from back then
[02:25:52] <Maxdamantus> I was aware of them because I had written a Spidermonkey plugin for XChat at the time, so I was looking into what libraries could be integrated into it.
[02:26:06] <Maxdamantus> Node wasn't very well known at the time.

[06:10:03] <MrBurns> Working version: https://pastebin.com/g9CbYXy4
[06:10:31] <wroathe> MrBurns: I thought we talked about this
[06:11:31] <wroathe> The current version of Angular is version 13.1. That's version 1.6. That's like the very beginning of Angular, and the current API is completely unrecognizable from that beginning state.
[06:11:51] <wroathe> So if you're teaching yourself how to program via Javascript frameworks, you've selected the wrong version of one

[06:11:57] <MrBurns> wroathe: now its nice to update it to newer version
[06:13:28] <wroathe> MrBurns: I don't remember when 1.6 came out, but I see in the changelog that the earliest version they started using a CHANGELOG file for was version 2.0, and that was back in 2016: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#200-proprioception-reinforcement-2016-09-14
[06:14:05] <wroathe> MrBurns: So you're using a version of a framework that is at least 5 years old. I remember using that version of Angular back in 2016 on a contract, and so that tracks.

[08:08:01] <systemfault> I'd personally take the 27"
[08:09:10] <systemfault> I'm using a 2K 27" at the moment and I believe I wouldn't personally benefit from a bigger monitor so I would go for a higher resolution
[08:09:31] <Rockwood> npm install eslint --save-dev i have done
[08:09:39] <theskillwithin> i need at least 2 27" monitors
[08:09:45] <kalen-> i'm really torn on it. my old monitor was the 2k 30" dell. i decided to get the 27" 4k one for black friday to be my new primary monitor, thinking the size difference wouldn't really be a big deal. but now that i have them both side-by-side, the size difference is very noticeable :/
[08:10:21] <systemfault> Well... if the idea was to keep 2 monitors, I would have picked the same size as the old..
[08:10:26] <kalen-> i feel like maybe i should've gone with a 32" 4k, but that seems a little too large. 30" is the perfect sweet spot for me
[08:10:42] <Rockwood> ljharb, npm install eslint --save-dev i have done this

[09:04:18] <theskillwithin> rustyshackleford advent of code?
[09:04:26] <rustyshackleford> yup
[09:06:01] <theskillwithin> rustyshackleford idk if its the same, but lodash has a zip function,  is using lodash allowed?
[09:06:08] <rustyshackleford> sure
[09:06:15] <theskillwithin> https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#zip
[09:06:25] <rustyshackleford> there must be a more js way to do it
[09:06:57] <rustyshackleford> but I'm prematurely optimizing now
[09:08:34] <theskillwithin> so you want  [0, 1, 2, 3]  to become  [[0,1], [1,2], [2,3], [3]]   ?
[09:08:46] <rustyshackleford> yeah
[09:09:04] <rustyshackleford> combine array.slice() and _.zip and I can make that work

[09:10:08] <rustyshackleford> I mean you could use a for loop and a temp variable
[09:11:33] <Rockwood> git and modules i know ljharb
[09:13:13] <theskillwithin> rustyshackleford loop might be easier, but cuz I hate loops my first attempt if I was going in raw would be reduce.   however if you know how to do with lodash,  I would just use lodash and be done with it
[09:13:28] <rustyshackleford> I also hate loops
[09:13:34] <rustyshackleford> what is this, CS 101?

[18:44:57] <teut> how does live updating work in js?  like a dashboard for stocks?
[18:45:03] <teut> websockets?
[18:45:32] <ThePendulum> either websockets or ajax requests, if the updates are at a high rate, probably web sockets
[18:46:10] <teut> dashboard for crypto
[18:46:26] <ThePendulum> for something like stocks I'm guessing there might be multiple updates per second, you may still wish to combine some events instead of shoving every single one of them through the socket individually

[18:47:46] <teut> what kind of troubles?
[18:47:50] <ThePendulum> that's the ajax approach, but in this case I mean the server does something like that, but setInterval(() => { ws.send(queue); queue = []; }, 1000)
[18:48:11] <teut> hmm
[18:48:21] <teut> so the thing has t o be done on bsckend
[18:48:23] <teut> a*
[18:48:39] <ThePendulum> we're having issues with websockets starting to clog up and forming a buffer in memory, but we're not quite sure yet if it's just the sheer amount of data or because we weren't doing any kind of timing control
[18:48:54] <ThePendulum> however managing the timing they are sent out seems to help
[18:49:19] <ThePendulum> we're using something similar for hitting the database
[18:49:52] <ThePendulum> we were hitting the connection limit of our database, so pooling together some inserts on a 1 second interval helped with that
[18:53:00] <teut> no idea of your problem. Regarding connection pooling, why does even one requires multiple connections to a db?
[18:53:41] <teut> why not use a single one?  is that that each connection runs in parallel?
[18:54:04] <teut> parallel  "different cores"

[22:08:11] <CoderGuy> Alexendoo, okay but if you were to do it which way si proper?
[22:08:13] <CoderGuy> is*
[22:08:41] <qswz> huoy99: show you .babelrc
[22:09:01] <qswz> what is you exact browserlist query?
[22:10:14] <huoy99> qswz: my babelrc just looks like this: { "presets": ["@babel/preset-env"] } and "browserlist" in package.json is set to "IE 8"
[22:10:38] <qswz> that's not a valid browserlist query
[22:10:48] <huoy99> oh
[22:10:54] <Alexendoo> CoderGuy: I wouldn't do it, all of the answers on that page are liable to cause bugs
[22:11:12] <qswz> oh well it seems good, sorry
[22:11:18] <CoderGuy> how would it cause a bug? you're just adding a function
[22:11:31] <qswz> https://browserslist.dev/?q=SUUgOA%3D%3D
[22:12:12] <Alexendoo> CoderGuy: You're mutating a global, so it effects any other code running in the same page/nodejs instance/etc. If two people are fine with the idea and both pick the same name now one is overriding the other
[22:12:53] <CoderGuy> yeah but, it's not gonna cause said problem because I control the code base
[22:13:07] <Alexendoo> The answers on that page are also creating enumerable properties, so if any code is using for..in on a string (which also shouldn't be done, be does happen) that code will stop working

[22:13:55] <CoderGuy> wait doesn't a string have functions on it, like string.split?
[22:14:13] <Alexendoo> They aren't enumerable
[22:14:28] <CoderGuy> okay so how can you add a function that would match the setting of having split as a function inside string?
[22:14:44] <CoderGuy> so you can do like string.customfunction()

[22:42:47] <KevinX> so the joke incorporates the dual meaning of the word type?
[22:44:28] <KevinX> "typecast" cast
[22:44:34] <KevinX> That's shorter
[22:45:30] <velix> KevinX: We're in Javascript.
[22:45:40] <velix> Typescript has more to do with JS than Typecast.
