[00:39:00] <ordex> BtbN: maybe you could compile ovpn-dco with DEBUG=1 and see if in dmesg there is anything out of ordinary?
[00:39:09] <ordex> maybe the IP is not translated correctly from the mapping (?)
[00:39:09] <BtbN> sure
[00:41:12] <ordex> thanks!
[00:44:00] <BtbN> ordex, https://bpa.st/XR7A that's what shows up in dmesg
[00:44:43] <ordex> endpoint=82.207.223.75:49186/UDPv6 <<I guess this is correct, isn't it ?
[00:45:01] <BtbN> I mean... generally? an IPv4 address next to UDPv6 is a bit odd
[00:45:26] <BtbN> but it is the correct IP
[00:46:01] <ordex> yeah it's odd, but the socket is indeed an UDPv6 socket
[00:46:55] <BtbN> In the openvpn log, the IP shows up as [AF_INET6]::ffff:82.207.223.75:49186
[00:47:04] <BtbN> which might be what the dco would actually need to use?
[00:47:17] <BtbN> cause clearly it can't talk to the client
[00:47:45] <BtbN> It does a bunch of "ovpn_peer_ping: sending ping to peer 0", and eventually "ovpn_peer_expire: peer 0 expired", "ovpn0: deleting peer with id 0, reason 2"
[00:47:49] <ordex> dco beautifies the IP before printing
[00:47:51] <ordex> yeah
[00:47:56] <ordex> because the data doesn't get through
[00:47:57] <ordex> ok
[00:48:00] <ordex> nothing "obvious" then
[00:48:03] <ordex> need to dig deeper
[00:48:05] <ordex> but thanks for trying

[18:02:35] <yogg> Hi
[18:04:17] <yogg> If openvpn uses the "--cryptoapicert" on a windows client with an "SUBJ: ..."Â  and it finds two or more certificates with the same subject. What does the openvpn client do in this case?
[18:07:12] <yogg> Will it simply test all the certificates that have that subject or will openvpn only take the first cert from the list and there is a 50:50 chance that the connection fails (if two certificates)?
[18:37:48] *** Quits: eelstrebor (~eelstrebo@198-178-29-136.scb.ne.static.allophone.net) (Quit: Ex-Chat)
[20:13:33] <plaisthos> yogg: I think it cannot test all, the TLS protocol does not allow that
[20:13:45] <plaisthos> but we might ignore expired ones, not sure
[20:19:25] <yogg> hmm, in my case it could be possible that a user has 2 certs with the same subject (one for openvpn and one for singing some things). But makes sense, openvpn gets the challenge and signs it, if it was the wrong cert the connection fails :/
[20:20:33] <yogg> Openvpn could only connect again and then try the other cert which is also problematic (multiple servers, ...)
[20:38:29] <plaisthos> yogg: yeah we don't have that kind of logic
[20:38:33] <plaisthos> I am pretty sure of that
[20:54:54] <yogg> Then we search for an alternative way. But thanks for the infos
