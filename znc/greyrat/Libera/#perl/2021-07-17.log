[04:53:03] <aquanight> the problem isn't getting hit by lightning itself. That whole "path of the least resistance" is more "every path, according to their respective resistances"
[04:53:42] <aquanight> people get got standing under trees when the bolt hits the ground near the tree, and the charge then goes out, around, and then up into the body.

[05:20:44] <jgaz> Grinnz: It's amazing how much water those things can pull out of the air in a day's time.
[05:21:45] <Grinnz> it's one of those where you set a humidity and it runs anytime the humidity is higher, and has a hose hookup for the water
[05:21:59] <Grinnz> unfortunately i don't have a drain in the basement, so i have to put it on a table so it can drain into the sink
[05:22:10] <Grinnz> but whatever works for my laziness

[05:30:23] <Grinnz> don't have any allergies or anything to clean from the air
[05:31:01] <v`> what relative humidity percentage do you like to keep the house at in the summer
[05:31:07] <v`> 35%?
[05:31:37] <Grinnz> generally more concerned about the temperature than humidity, but the A/C tends to keep it around 40%
[05:32:28] <Grinnz> you'd think steam heating would help humidify in the winter but sadly not really
[05:33:26] <v`> i'll probably have to get a humidifying unit for the winter
[05:33:51] <v`> maybe one of those dyson ones
[05:33:58] <v`> even though dyson is pricey
[05:34:33] <Grinnz> i've gone through a few, really depends on what kind of tap water you've got as to how often you need to clean it, but usually after a year or two they stop being silent and i get a new one
[05:35:27] <v`> yep silent operation is pretty important
[05:35:49] <Grinnz> so yeah a little wary of spending too much on one
[05:39:30] <Grinnz> latest one has lasted two years so far, doesn't have an auto shutoff threshold or anything fancy just a single knob, but none of the other features did anything for me anyway
[05:40:10] <Grinnz> if they auto shutoff, their detector would overreact and i'd have to raise its threshold anyway

[16:29:46] <simcop2387> LeoNerd++ genio++
[16:30:22] <simcop2387> ehuelsmann[m]: yea it'll be a great addition esp with a new/updated IO::Async::Loop::UV to do it nice and fast on many platforms
[16:30:57] <simcop2387> i might see if i can make an Alien::UV that can build libuv for it then too actually.
[16:32:33] <ehuelsmann[m]> simcop2387: totally. I was working on a tool that ended up being developed on lib EV.  But since I didn't really want to depend too heavily on lib EV, development got stalled.
[16:32:57] <ehuelsmann[m]> UV probably gets me back on the topic.
[16:33:10] <simcop2387> the biggest addition it gives is windows support, afaik libev still doesn't work fully there
[16:33:50] <LeoNerd> At some point we could still do something like adding all the async filesystem stuff for UV, but for now at least I think it's good enough to call it 2.000 and ship it for real
[16:34:04] <LeoNerd> .oO( and then I get paid by TPF for my time ;) )
[16:35:00] <simcop2387> LeoNerd: yea i keep meaning to finish up my custom io_uring stuff to help drive that interface design too.  i really want to add opendir, open, etc. to IO::Async::Loop so that you could do stat() and open() on a few thousand files over NFS and have it actually perform nicely.
[16:35:39] <ehuelsmann[m]> I think you're completely correct there. As for the filesystem stuff:it would be nice to be able to add that indeed. exactly what simcop2387 says.
[16:35:56] <ehuelsmann[m]> maybe others in the community help out.
[16:37:01] <simcop2387> yea i don't expect a direct io_uring event loop from perl to actually be all that performant really, but it'll be a nice proof of concept kind of thing that'll help be able to flesh out any design issues for other things like libuv, glib, etc. that can also support such things (I think the latest glibs have pretend interfaces for that at least now)
[16:37:51] <ehuelsmann[m]> from what I understoood: libev has threads checking "stat()" and "lstat()".
[16:38:03] <ehuelsmann[m]> I think libuv has the same strategy.
[16:38:12] <LeoNerd> Sidecar workers, yup
[16:38:17] <LeoNerd> The same trick that IO::Async::Function uses
[16:38:28] <ehuelsmann[m]> at least that means we can do ~ 10 stats at the same time.
[16:38:31] <LeoNerd> I've always been intending to write an IO::Async::Filesystem to abstract out all those things, just didn't get around to it
[16:38:39] <simcop2387> yea i expect libev and/or libuv to eventually add io_uring support for those given that it can perform enourmously better on network file systems
[16:38:49] <LeoNerd> I've never had a situation where it would make much difference
[16:38:50] <ehuelsmann[m]> which (over nfs) is better than doing them in-line.
[16:39:07] <LeoNerd> Doing them lower-level in libuv means we don't pay the perl-based abstraction overhead, so it makes more sense there
[16:39:08] *** Quits: akaWolf (~akaWolf@akawolf.org) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[16:39:21] <simcop2387> LeoNerd: yea that's probably the right way to do it, since then you could have a generic version that uses IA:Function to do it when the lower level loop doesn't have it's own way to do it
[16:39:35] <ehuelsmann[m]> LeoNerd: right. also, it means that more platforms benefit.
[16:40:23] <LeoNerd> simcop2387: My intention was to basically do it "via" the loop, so that IaL:UV can provide a better stub
[16:40:34] <LeoNerd> E.g. the way that the loop abstracts resolver or other things
[16:40:56] <simcop2387> yea
[16:41:02] <ehuelsmann[m]> the solution that I'm working on depends on filesystem notifications after looping over large filesystem hierarchies.
[16:41:17] <simcop2387> ehuelsmann[m]: what i love about the io_uring way of doing it is that you can end up with an amortized latency/time for doing stuff like opening files or stat()ing them on nfs or glusterfs or similar that makes the end performance nearly identical to local disks if you do more than a few accesses at once (which isn't terribly hard to do for a lot of stuff)
[16:42:24] <simcop2387> ehuelsmann[m]: oh yea you'd hugely benefit from a proper io_uring setup then probably.  that's the kind of thing where the syntheic benchmarks i've seen have a 10x or better speedup because the actual actions never leave kernel space and you're not paying the cost of lots of synchronous syscalls, even if in another threaed.
[16:42:59] <ehuelsmann[m]> On some OSes, there's no good (Perl) support for listening to OS events, meaning the fallback is to do a tree scan every so often.
[16:43:00] <simcop2387> now writing the code to actually do things so that you get that benefit is a different manner, but it's basically a best case scenario for io_uring
[16:43:24] <simcop2387> s/manner/issue/
[16:43:28] <simcop2387> i'm only just waking up
[16:43:45] <simcop2387> or matter is likely the word i wanted

[19:05:51] <Mandevil> Why does it not default to utf-8 :-(
[19:06:34] <LeoNerd> because people used to write binary data to STDOUT back in the days of a cgi-bin/make-graph.pl
[19:06:43] <LeoNerd> for outputting GIF or PNG or whatever
[19:10:08] <Grinnz> used to?
[19:11:06] <Grinnz> STDOUT is just bytes, the real solution to this would be some way to lexically switch STDOUT between accepting bytes or characters
[19:11:51] <Mandevil> Line discipline?
[19:12:35] <LeoNerd> Grinnz: Write an RFC for  local binmode STDOUT...;  ;)
[19:12:49] <LeoNerd> Imean, we already support  local delete $hash{key};  right?
[19:12:53] <Grinnz> the problem is you can only do it globally, because STDOUT is global and layers are per-handle, so even setting it yourself means half of your program might then use STDOUT wrongly
[19:13:11] <Grinnz> i'm not sure local is even enough
[19:13:18] <thrig> it's super global, STDOUT is shared across processes
[19:13:23] <Grinnz> that still means you can't call any code in that scope which writes to STDOUT
[19:14:14] <Grinnz> i'm thinking "use lexical::layers STDOUT => ':encoding(UTF-8)'"
[19:14:15] *** Joins: gast0n (~g4570n@user/gast0n)
[19:14:18] <LeoNerd> thrig: right; but the :encoding IO layer is a process-side concept within perl. It isn't shared at a UNIX level

[19:14:46] <LeoNerd> Grinnz: I dunno. I think i'd want it dynamic, like `local`... if it was purely lexical then I can't call any logging functions
[19:14:47] <Grinnz> i'm sure dup handles would make it fun though
[19:15:03] <LeoNerd> { local binmode STDOUT, ":encoding(UTF-8)"; log_an_error($@); }
[19:15:08] <Grinnz> LeoNerd: exactly the point - logging functions would have their own idea of whether they want to pass bytes or characters
[19:15:21] <Grinnz> Mojo::Log expects STDERR to be bytes for example

[19:17:07] <Grinnz> if a newly written logging function wanted to depend on this, it could inspect the hints of the caller? there's precedent for that
[19:17:27] <Grinnz> but i kind of don't like when things do taht
[19:18:04] <LeoNerd> inspecting caller is always tricky, because it means you can't write trivial function wrappers

[19:20:00] <xenu> or just maybe that logging function should clone STDOUT and attach the layers it wants to it
[19:22:14] <Grinnz> the main problem is layers are a mostly-idiotic list
[19:22:29] <ehuelsmann[m]> talking of UTF-8, I have a series of questions regarding `use utf8;`, `use Encoding qw( decode )` and this PR that I have to understand: https://github.com/pherkin/test-bdd-cucumber-perl/pull/191/files
[19:22:30] <Paperbot_> Link title(s): [ fix utf8 handeling in test name by DragosTrif · Pull Request #191 · pherkin/test-bdd-cucumber-per... ]
[19:22:37] <Grinnz> not easy to just say "turn this into a character stream" or "turn this back into a byte stream" in a reversible way
[19:22:58] <Grinnz> :raw may remove different layers, and may flip bits on existing layers
[19:23:13] <Grinnz> adding :encoding to an already character stream just results in double encoding
[19:23:29] <ehuelsmann[m]> let me start by asking confirmation of my understanding of `use utf8;`: am I correct that I need to use `utf8` only when the source contains UTF-8 characters?
[19:23:35] <Grinnz> ehuelsmann[m]: yes
[19:24:14] <LeoNerd> correct. `use utf8` makes a statement about the .pm source code file it appears in, and says nothing about any data that program operates on
[19:24:17] <Grinnz> that test file is wrong; it doesn't use utf8
[19:24:30] <Grinnz> or actually nevermind that
[19:24:51] <Grinnz> it's JSON, so maybe it's supposed to be bytes
[19:24:59] <xenu> { use utf8; my $foo = "bąr"; } is rougly equivalent to { no utf8; my $foo = decode('UTF-8', "bąr") } 
[19:25:10] <Grinnz> but the JSON decoder doesn't treat it as bytes
[19:25:14] <xenu> roughly*
[19:25:15] *** Joins: slowButPresent (~slowButPr@user/slowbutpresent)
[19:25:16] <Grinnz> so the test file still looks wrong
[19:25:34] <ehuelsmann[m]> Grinnz: the main file is wrong, because it doesn't contain UTF-8 characters; using utf8 doesn't change much.
[19:25:43] <Grinnz> yes it's pointless there
[19:26:09] <xenu> it's pointless but it doesn't hurt

[19:27:16] <ehuelsmann[m]> then the next question is: Perl makes no statement of the internal character representation, meaning that if anything is printed to a file handle, it runs through an output layer which converts the internal representation to a string of octets (bytes) which could be UTF-8 encoded (with the right encoding layer in place)
[19:27:23] <ehuelsmann[m]> is that correct?
[19:27:45] <Grinnz> yes
[19:27:48] <ehuelsmann[m]> even if the output filehandle wraps a scalar.
[19:28:02] <Grinnz> also, this problem is specific to Test2, not STDOUT - Test2 has its own stream handling

[19:28:56] <ehuelsmann[m]> oh. my client eats the backslash
[19:30:22] <ehuelsmann[m]> if Test2 does its own file handling, I should probably check what it does before I can accept the PR.
[19:30:44] <ehuelsmann[m]> I mean, I wouldn't want to introduce one problem to resolve another.
[19:31:17] <ehuelsmann[m]> better to understand what the root cause is and work out how to deal with that.
[19:31:59] <Grinnz> commented a bit on the PR
[19:34:16] <ehuelsmann[m]> thanks! I'll study the original problem and your comments and come up with a fix that is likely to work "everywhere".
[19:35:15] <Grinnz> i'm not convinced there's a problem here
[19:35:28] <Grinnz> especially considering the complete misunderstanding of character encoding in that person's linked SO post
[19:36:27] <ehuelsmann[m]> I'm happy you say that, because I was really careful when I wrote the original code, trying not to step in any of the traps that this topic comes with.
[19:36:50] <ehuelsmann[m]> I'll still try to be serious about the problem of the reporter though.

[22:45:33] <Mandevil> It should be converging, but it's diverging wildly instead.
[22:47:03] <ehuelsmann[m]> Grinnz: thanks for your reviews on the PR. Is there a way to have a "file handle to a scalar" just copy the string content of any printed strings? That way I could just collect the internal string characters in the output scalar and use it as a string immediately again.
[22:48:17] *** Quits: Manderson_ (~manderson@047-028-019-189.res.spectrum.com) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[22:48:48] <Grinnz> scalar handles can only print bytes, like any other handle
[22:49:41] <ehuelsmann[m]> ok. no problem. that helps to fix the problem with the PR.
[22:49:42] <ehuelsmann[m]> I now do think there's a problem, just not what's being tested for.
[22:49:57] <Grinnz> if you have a variable that contains text encoded to bytes, you'll need to decode it to use it in APIs that expect characters
[22:50:15] <Grinnz> like most of Test2
[22:50:55] <Grinnz> it just depends whether you can guarantee that the bytes in that variable were encoded to UTF-8
[22:51:05] <Grinnz> (for your sanity, this would be a good thing to ensure)
[22:51:51] <ehuelsmann[m]> yes. I've traced the full handling of text in the library and I think there's one spot indeed where this is lacking.
[22:52:57] <ehuelsmann[m]> the entire reference to Test2 is confusing, because the output isn't (normally) sent to Test2. Test2 is only used to provide a testing environment that Perl programmers are used to.
[22:52:58] <ehuelsmann[m]> so the application builds on Test2's Test2::Hub to collect all the test outcomes and further process it in different ways.
[22:54:03] <ehuelsmann[m]> the guy who filed the bug is not sending it to Test2 after he collected the test outcomes; instead, he's creating an HTML report of the input file, enhanced with the test outcomes.

[22:58:16] <Mandevil> It doesn't return what it should.

[23:17:21] <Mandevil> It's unfinished code, but the $sig should eventually stop changing.

[23:18:28] <Mandevil> I worry but I don't know what can I do about it.
[23:18:55] <Grinnz> you could use Math::BigFloat but it'll be slow
[23:19:48] <Mandevil> That will make Math::Trig functions switch to big floats too?
[23:20:06] <Mandevil> Wait not, I'd need to update the code.
[23:20:10] <Grinnz> alternatively, use an epsilon to determine if the delta is over a threshold, rather than checking for equality
[23:20:24] <Grinnz> yes, you'd need to use Math::BigFloat methods instead of Math::Trig
[23:20:32] <Mandevil> I'm using last if abs($sig - $prev_sig) < 1e-12;
[23:20:48] <Grinnz> that should work
[23:21:00] <Mandevil> But GIS::Distance uses normal floats as well, so I guess it's enough.
