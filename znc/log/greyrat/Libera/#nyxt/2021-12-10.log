[03:09:17] <Thovthe> I try to have at least a kernal of value in my askings
[03:10:05] <Thovthe> GItSC i've read about the step function and it looks really powerful and easy to use in whatever CL implementation he uses.  Does SBCL have anything so nice?
[03:11:13] <Thovthe> Ultimatly, if i can wrap my head around lisp and programming I hope to aid the development of a customizable user respecting browser.

[03:13:59] <Thovthe> https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/LispBook/book.pdf
[03:22:03] <jmercouris> Thovthe: SBCL has similar facilities yes
[03:22:49] <Thovthe> I've tried (step (func))  but it seems to take larger steps.
[03:24:41] <Thovthe> Is there something else more granular
[03:24:42] <Thovthe> ?
[03:25:33] <jmercouris> Hm
[03:25:43] <jmercouris> I guess one could set many break points
[03:25:54] <jmercouris> You may also need to change your compilation settings

[22:32:49] <jmercouris> aartaka: shall I merge it in?
[22:33:00] <jmercouris> You can blame it on me if everything explodes :-D
[22:40:59] <lagash> jmercouris: in https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/blob/master/source/mode/web.lisp#L686, what's the optional buffer argument for? like, I can't use it in a buffer listing, right?? what's it for? for non-interactive purposes??
[22:41:24] <jmercouris> lagash: correct
[22:41:32] <jmercouris> So that you can specify a buffer
[22:41:49] <jmercouris> I should note however that you can also specify it interactively!
[22:42:25] <jmercouris> If you run “execute extended command” and then “show QR code of current url” it will allow you to specify a buffer
[22:44:07] <jmercouris> Also, happy zucchini Friday!
[22:55:41] <jmercouris> It really is a cozy zucchini Friday
[22:58:32] <lagash> On a related note... https://paste.c-net.org/KomakoPunched
[22:58:52] <lagash> jmercouris: is it possible to specify multiple buffers?
[22:59:34] <lagash> if not for that command, for others?
[22:59:54] <lagash> hmmm, I see it asks for code..
[23:00:00] <jmercouris> lagash: yes, it’s possible to specify multiple buffers for many commands
[23:00:33] <jmercouris> You can also use our handy dandy macro make-mapped-command where you specify a command and it will become mappable to multiple buffers
[23:00:36] <lagash> I mean, I knew that, but wouldn't show-qrcode-of-current-url have to be modified for that usecase?
[23:00:48] <jmercouris> lagash: indeed it would be
[23:00:51] <lagash> Oh. Well that might work!
[23:01:13] <jmercouris> Lmao that QR code is a big boy
[23:01:25] <lagash> I spy a new mode... :)
[23:01:44] <jmercouris> Indeed
[23:01:50] <jmercouris> Since literally yesterday
[23:02:00] <jmercouris> Or are you saying you are working on a new mode?
[23:05:30] <mariari> jmercouris: should I still try the pathced I got pinged with, it seems it was mentioned a newer PR that is still in flight
[23:07:28] <jmercouris> mariari: I would wait
[23:07:36] <jmercouris> I will try to merge today
[23:07:40] <lagash> Nah, just the bookmark frequent URLs thing that came out :)
[23:07:48] <jmercouris> lagash: ah yes
