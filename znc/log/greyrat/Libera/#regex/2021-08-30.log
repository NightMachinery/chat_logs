[08:08:10] <jargon> Or it is a linux vs Windows issue?

[15:28:03] <digitok> yea i realised i didn't exclude those, but you'd already quit
[15:28:13] <purplex> change \n to \s if you don't need any spaces (if they aren't special characters in your case).
[15:28:27] <digitok> i think you need to add & to the list
[15:28:37] <re101-civet-18> okay 
[15:28:54] <purplex> I didn't see any mention of &

[17:12:33] <re101-cuscus-96> oh, tell me more
[17:12:39] <digitok> if you don't see them, they don't matter :)
[17:14:36] <digitok> what's the reason qid contains a space?
[17:14:41] <digitok> seems like it shouldn't be valid
[17:15:00] <digitok> that's not the error, just curious
[17:15:01] <re101-cuscus-96> It didn't originally. 
[17:15:11] <re101-cuscus-96> I masked it to that because here is the original event
[17:15:30] <digitok> so you don't need to allow spaces in that context?
[17:15:30] <re101-cuscus-96> One sec
[17:15:57] <re101-cuscus-96> https://regex101.com/r/1JRHFM/1/
[17:16:24] <digitok> ok but that presents the same issue
[17:16:25] <re101-cuscus-96> The original event that I was given has a carriage return.  So I updated the match with [\S\s]
[17:16:43] <digitok> you should simply remove the newline, not replace it with a space
[17:17:16] <digitok> then you can use this https://regex101.com/r/1JRHFM/2
[17:17:56] <re101-cuscus-96> Ah, so are you thinking I was given a bad event with an extra carriage return?
[17:18:37] <digitok> well, i'm no expert, but i've never seen a value with a space that wasn't in quotes
[17:19:08] <digitok> and 018262 by itself doesn't seem valid
[17:19:22] <digitok> since it isn't followed by =
[17:19:28] <digitok> so presumably it's part of the qid right?
[17:20:01] <re101-cuscus-96> Yeah, I thought it was odd for sure, so I just masked it.  I dunno what it is since the customer gave me the event in slack and I don't work in sendmail events ever
[17:20:56] <digitok> i suppose removing them completely would break other values
[17:21:06] <digitok> so not sure the best solution
[17:23:17] <digitok> this would be one way https://regex101.com/r/1JRHFM/3
[17:23:28] <digitok> assuming that is indeed part of the qid
[17:23:48] <digitok> you'd just end up with the newline in the value
[17:23:59] <re101-cuscus-96> right

[18:44:40] <Me-me> Okay so there are a few ways to approach this, none of which are perfect.
[18:44:50] <Me-me> One is to have two different groups, one of which will match and one of which won't.
[18:45:56] <Me-me> https://regex101.com/r/SevnKB/4 That'll look like this.
[18:46:16] <Me-me> Another is to have edge cases where technically invalid strings will match.
[18:49:59] <Seb57> OK, so I think the two different groups works well. I'll try to implement this approach in my python code. Thank you !
[18:50:10] <Me-me> Happy to help.

[20:53:25] <jb_> Hi. I don't know regular expressions and I have trivial problem like adding a word to the end of matched line. I have something like this: s/^(# REQUIRE: DAEMON:).*/\1 postgresql - unfortunately this replaces everything after matched line, not adding 'postgresql' to the end of matched line.

[20:58:23] <koollman> jb_: the group is whatever is between ( and )  
[20:59:27] <koollman> jb_: so, reading your regex like this: you match the beginning of the line, then you match (# REQUIRE: DAEMON:), which is put in group 1, then you match anything (which is not put in any group)
[20:59:50] <koollman> jb_: then, on the replacement side, you put back what is in group 1, then what you want to add. See why it replaces things ? :)

[21:19:15] <rewt> there is also \K which means "reset the match start position" that you can use as:  s/^# REQUIRE: DAEMON:.*\K/ postgresql/
[21:20:58] <rewt> so it matches # REQUIRE: DAEMON: at the start of the line, and everything after it, to the end of the line, and goes "reset the match position", so the effective "match" is just the end-of-line position, so basically just adds " postgresql" on the end of the line
