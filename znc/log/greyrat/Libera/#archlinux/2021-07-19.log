[02:33:51] <riv> you can make a swap file

[04:48:06] <phrik> Title: dm-crypt/Encrypting an entire system - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
[04:48:32] <johnnyapol> The guide needs to be changed slightly though - it has a chmod line for /boot/initramfs
[04:48:40] *** Quits: karabaja4 (~karabaja4@dh207-92-207.xnet.hr) (Quit: leaving)
[04:48:50] <johnnyapol> in reality /boot should be made 600 instead of just the initramfs

[04:49:11] *** Quits: polve (~polve@user/polve) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[04:49:30] <johnnyapol> the reason being that when the initramfs is regenerated, the permissions would get overwritten which made the decryption key world-readable
[04:49:48] <randomxusr> hmm, so place everything on /boot on the same partition with the rest of the FS, and just make boot 600? sounds easy enough
[04:50:16] <randomxusr> does this present any challenges for you during upgrades?

[04:50:39] <johnnyapol> once I got it working I havent had to touch it. kernel updates come and go without issue
[04:51:06] <johnnyapol> i havent been through a grub upgrade yet though since its so new

[04:52:49] <randomxusr> ah got it. if any issues with grub, I would hope it could be scripted to set permissions on all files correctly
[04:53:13] <randomxusr> did you use LVM? because I'm trying to avoid an extra step
[04:53:47] <johnnyapol> no, i just run xfs right on top of dm-crypt / cryptsetup
[04:55:39] *** Joins: sept (~user1@24-212-185-118.cable.teksavvy.com)
[04:55:42] <randomxusr> Nice. I chose BTRFS because of the volumes and plan to set backups with timeshift to a NAS device
[04:56:12] *** Joins: js3z (~js3z@146.115.76.107)
[04:56:23] <randomxusr> did you have do anything with crypttab to ensure only a single prompt?
[04:57:40] <sept> I used lshw. It appears like, even though there's a lsusb entry, there is no driver. I installed an AUR driver. How do I tell the kernel to load a particular driver for that usb device?

[04:59:30] <johnnyapol> i will caution though, it probably is easier to make /boot luks1 and then the rest of your system luks2 (or everything luks1). theres just no a bunch of great documentation yet
[05:00:55] <randomxusr> good point. My thought is that if I'm encrypting any way, that I need to make regular backups. I suspect that issue would be more likely with spinning rust that nvme

[05:03:32] <randomxusr> to my earlier comment. I meant to suggest that Luks with an FS that has much fragmentation could be more problematic. just a guess though

[05:53:38] <NoSQL> I've got some filesystem-heavy processes running on a non-boot / non-system, storage only drive. When I go to run pamac / pacman to install things, it sits for a VERY long time (15-30 mins) at "Syncing all file systems", in the beginning, then again at the end of the pacman / pamac run. Is there a way to exclude other drives from pacman's filesystem sync?

[14:04:25] <ishan> But _somehow_, I am still getting traffic on port 53 
[14:04:53] <grawity> how are you looking at the traffic you're getting?
[14:05:09] *** Quits: nortega (~nortega@user/nortega) (Quit: God bless you!)
[14:05:22] <ishan> If I run `dig +tcp @<my address>` or `dig @<my address>` on my machine, I get connection refused errors but some bot somewhere in US is still querying against the server 
[14:05:28] <ishan> grawity: i am using tcpdump 
[14:05:30] <grawity> keep in mind a firewall only stops the OS from handling those packets – it can't physically stop the NIC from receiving them
[14:05:54] <grawity> so in tcpdump you will continue seeing all the garbage that you're receiving, because it is captured *outside* the firewall
[14:06:00] <ishan> grawity: Yes, but the adguard home instance on the server is also responding to these queries 
[14:06:12] <grawity> now that's a different issue
[14:06:36] <ishan> I suspect it's a already established tcp connection that didn't get dropped when I added the firewall rule 
[14:06:47] <grawity> try `conntrack -D -p udp --dport 53` or just a full `conntrack -F`
[14:07:20] <ishan> looks like conntrack isn't available in arch repos
[14:07:31] <grawity> ?pkgfile conntrack
[14:07:31] <EMIYA> grawity: extra/conntrack-tools 1.4.6-2 (/usr/bin/conntrack), community/fwbuilder, community/shorewall, community/shorewall6
[14:07:34] <grawity> looks like it is
[14:07:57] <ishan> oh I am sorry. I was running pacman -Q conntrack to check
[14:08:02] <ishan> whereas it's pacman -F conntrack
[14:09:41] <ishan> Yes, looks like it was just an already established tcp connection that wasn't dropped when I added the firewall rules. After flushing tcp connection table, I still see traffic coming in from these bots but my server isn't responding to that traffic

[14:20:46] <grawity> something else than "REFUSED"
[14:20:48] <ishan> pizzaseo doesn't point anywhere so my server was just responding with nxdomain 
[14:21:04] <grawity> yeah that is already not very good
[14:21:27] <grawity> due to the fact alone that you're running an open resolver without much worry about rate limits and stuff
[14:22:23] <ishan> Yes, I wasn't supposed to leave 53 port accessible to public but I messed with ufw some time back and forgot to fix it. Now, that I have fixed it. It only responds to dot/doh queries 
[14:22:23] <grawity> many of those queries are pretty much using open resolvers as a DDoS amplifier

[14:24:58] <grawity> IP packets with very high TTLs + unusually low UDP source ports (53->53, 80->53, etc.) + DNS queries for things like RRSIG that tend to produce massive replies

[23:26:26] <apocalyptech> Hello all!  I've got a system which has started *not* mounting all of its /etc/fstab filesystems at boot for some reason: https://gist.github.com/apocalyptech/54a83a20390b169089e137a1d6e5f5f3

[23:27:24] <apocalyptech> The .mount units show up in `systemctl list-units --all`, they're in /etc/fstab properly, I can mount them manually with either `systemctl` or `mount`; any reason why these would've stopped working?

[23:27:52] <MrElendig> anyway, check logs?
[23:27:55] <apocalyptech> This did start happening after an upgrade, which was *also* after a power outage, but the filesystem checks are all clean and there's no noticeable data problems on there

[23:28:26] <apocalyptech> Yeah, one of the commands listed in there was checking journalctl for any instance of `usr-local`; I'd also looked for other paths in there as well
[23:28:42] *** Quits: fossdd (~fossdd@sourcehut/user/fossdd) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[23:28:51] <apocalyptech> And I'd also checked `systemctl status` on those `.mount` units as well -- no log entries at all show up for 'em
[23:29:41] <apocalyptech> re: "what is this /usr/local stuff", they're just data dirs that I've been dragging around with me for over a decade now; I know that /usr/local isn't the best place for a lot of that, but it's less work to just leave 'em the way they've been since like 2005.  :)
[23:29:48] *** Joins: fossdd (~fossdd@sourcehut/user/fossdd)
[23:32:32] <apocalyptech> Hrmph, well.  They weren't mounting properly across like three reboots, but one more seems to have gotte 'em mounted properly again.

[23:34:31] <apocalyptech> Aha, but one *more* reboot and some of them stopped working again
[23:35:03] <apocalyptech> This time I've got /usr/local/vmware and /usr/local/winex mounted, but not /usr/local/dv
[23:36:40] <apocalyptech> And again, seemingly absolutely nothing in the logs about even attempting it: https://gist.github.com/apocalyptech/c5efbec74d5c4e213b179944c63000e1
[23:39:26] <apocalyptech> If it were trying and failing (such as if it was trying to mount /usr/local/dv before /usr/local was mounted, or something) I'd expect to see that in the logs somewhere

[23:49:29] <apocalyptech> Okay, well, my mount thing doesn't actually look like a *new* problem, actually.  Been happening since at least April 25.  I'm actually in the habit of doing a `mount -a` after a reboot anyway, because I've never been able to convince systemd to properly mount my network filesystems on boot anyway
