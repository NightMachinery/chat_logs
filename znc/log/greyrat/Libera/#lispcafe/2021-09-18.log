[19:10:44] <lisp123> ln43: Hey ln43 :) Hope you are well
[19:11:10] <ln43> yes not so well... each day passed with Python is not a fully good day
[19:11:18] <ln43> but ok, partially ok
[19:11:44] <lisp123> It sounds like you have converted to the cult of lisp ;)

[19:12:14] <lisp123> Nice
[19:12:18] <lisp123> I will start PAIP soon

[19:12:44] <lisp123> In python?
[19:12:49] <ln43> yes
[19:12:58] <lisp123> You should try translating it to Lisp
[19:13:11] <lisp123> will be a great learning exercise, then I can just use your lisp code ;)
[19:13:20] <ln43> but it's funny: there are interactive graphs and so on working with cancas
[19:13:23] <ln43> vas
[19:14:00] <lisp123> Ah yes, that stuff is not easy in Lisp Land
[19:14:08] <lisp123> I thought Python would be much better at that
[19:14:09] <ln43> now, really i like the style lisp uses... but ok
