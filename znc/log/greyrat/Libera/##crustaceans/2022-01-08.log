[00:00:13] <ngoldbaum> pixel 5g covid edition
[00:00:46] <companion_cube> with a microchip
[00:01:01] <gerikson> work phone has 5G but no Qi
[00:01:13] <gerikson> which frankly sux
[00:01:22] <Brekkjern> Is Qi that nice?
[00:01:24] <companion_cube> I like my pixel phone, *but* no fucking LED
[00:01:26] <companion_cube> I hate it
[00:01:30] <companion_cube> such a good feature
[00:02:00] <gerikson> I like wireless charging yeah
[00:02:11] <manicennui> My Pixel 3 for work is probably my favorite phone.
[00:02:20] <manicennui> But I don't want my phone to do much.
[00:03:55] <gerikson> dunno what the job I'm starting on will offer as phone
[00:04:06] <manicennui> And I'm sure they will fuck it up soon with an OS update.
[00:04:14] <manicennui> Or just stop providing updates.
[00:05:25] <manicennui> Really sad that Google decided that they should try to compete with the iPhone instead of just offering solid middle-tier phones.
[00:05:39] <manicennui> And they more expensive phones aren't really better.
[00:05:42] <manicennui> s/they/their/
[00:05:58] <Brekkjern> What I like with the Google phones is that the software is just... Android
[00:06:00] <Brekkjern> Nothing more
[00:06:09] <manicennui> Yeah, that is one of the big draws.
[00:06:30] <Brekkjern> It drove me nuts to have Samsung try to shove their own shit in my face every time I hit the "share" button
[00:06:31] <manicennui> But I think the company paid like $399 for the Pixel 3.
[00:06:41] <manicennui> And now the 6 is $599.
[00:07:27] <manicennui> I also have the stand for my 3, which is a really great feature, even if it is overpriced.
[00:08:11] <manicennui> Much prefer the stand for wireless charging, and it does some useful things while in the stand, like optionally keeping the display on so I can use it as an alarm better.
[00:09:23] <ngoldbaum> qi kinda sucks
[00:09:34] <ngoldbaum> magsafe on my iphone 13 is ok
[00:09:40] <ngoldbaum> 15w is kinda slow
[00:09:52] <ngoldbaum> qi is like 5w?
[00:10:03] <gerikson> I just want to cut down on cables
[00:10:30] <defect> the new google charging stand is pretty ugly though :/
[00:11:37] <bkero> it's slow and 50% efficient
[00:11:47] <bkero> at larges it's a minor environmental disaster
[00:11:49] <bkero> at large*
[00:13:33] <manicennui> defect: The stand for the 3 looks better.
[00:14:08] <manicennui> I charge my Pixel on my iPhone magsafe charger. It doesn't stick to it, but it charges.
[00:14:18] <manicennui> I don't use my phones enough to have to charge much.
[00:14:28] <defect> manicennui: this one? https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/75759e98-3488-4048-84b3-090ba97cea56.8cad5cc6b9b6041d979e7cb327b428ac.jpeg?odnHeight=612&odnWidth=612&odnBg=FFFFFF
[00:14:30] <manicennui> I charge them a couple times per week.
[00:14:37] <manicennui> defect: Yes.
[00:14:42] <defect> yeah, i like that look better
[00:15:44] <manicennui> I really wish there were products that were just made more reliable/bug free each year instead of "better".
[00:16:19] <manicennui> You'd think that we would discourage this nonsense since it just leads to a fuckton of waste.
[00:16:43] <companion_cube> as if "we" had a real say in such directions
[00:16:58] <manicennui> We do.
[00:16:59] <companion_cube> companies don't have any interest in doing better, longer-lived stuff
[00:17:15] <companion_cube> only insofar as we can vote for parties that will put regulations in place
[00:17:17] <manicennui> Most smartphones don't break after a year or two.
[00:17:25] <manicennui> People choose to get new ones.
[00:17:29] <companion_cube> which is 245th item on their priority list
[00:17:35] <companion_cube> well, software makes them slower
[00:17:37] <companion_cube> lack of updates
[00:17:50] <companion_cube> people update too often, but they're not helped either
[00:17:50] <manicennui> Pixel 3 got updated with Android 12.
[00:18:06] <manicennui> It is about 3.5 years old now.
[00:18:13] <companion_cube> well good for you
[00:18:38] <companion_cube> heh, I'm still on android 11
[00:18:42] <manicennui> I mean people could choose products based on stuff like this, and not buy new products just because.
[00:18:42] <companion_cube> but then it's calyxOS
[00:19:02] <manicennui> It's not a secret that Google has done a better job keeping their phones updated.
[00:20:43] <companion_cube> you have to research a bit to know it
[00:20:55] <companion_cube> we are more exposed to it because we are nerds, so it seems obvious

[00:53:46] <indigo> Just curious, for those of you that have had dental work done, is it normal to have pain when you bite down on the filling after the procedure?
[00:54:28] <bkero> Yes
[00:54:40] <imode> if it persists after the first day you should call your dentist.
[00:54:48] <indigo> Ok whew
[00:54:56] <indigo> Yeah I already scheduled a bite adjustment for Monday
[00:55:50] <bkero> I don't leave the chair until the bite carbon sheet is clean
[00:56:15] *** Quits: dcz (~dcz@user/dcz) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[00:56:31] <indigo> This procedure was a little rough since the numbing didn't work right for one of the teeth
[00:56:37] <indigo> So I wanted to GTFO :P
[00:58:48] <gwozniak> oof
[00:59:43] <gwozniak> I've had much dental work done, despite the fact I floss and brush regularly.  I also had braces and 8 teeth pulled, so I've been in a dentist's chair a lot.  And yeah, if it's a big filling, it will hurt for a bit
[01:00:14] <gwozniak> I really hate the dental dams
[01:00:24] <gwozniak> Which is a recent thing
[01:01:22] <gwozniak> I have to get a small filling later this month.  Ugh.  Tired of them, thb
[01:01:25] <indigo> Same here. My dentist says it's just genetics
[01:01:26] <gwozniak> *tbh
[01:01:38] <indigo> Damn Eastern European genes
[01:01:45] <imode> teeth suck
[01:01:47] <gwozniak> I drew the short straw genetically on that front, too
[01:01:57] <indigo> I got braces too and that caused some gum recession
[01:02:04] <gwozniak> I had a huge overbite when I was a kid, and my teeth were a real mess
[01:02:37] <gwozniak> I even had a conical tooth come in behind my front teeth when I was about 6 or 7.
[01:02:55] <gwozniak> So my on front tooth was twisted a bit
[01:03:00] <gwozniak> *one
[01:03:10] <indigo> Oh jeez
[01:03:27] <gwozniak> I had to wear headgear for a couple of years
[01:03:31] <imode> ouch.
[01:03:40] <indigo> Oh nooo :( I bet you made a lot of friends with that headgear
[01:03:55] <gwozniak> Going to a new school with headgear was a ton of fun! ;)
[01:04:22] <gwozniak> I had elastics for a while, too.  Then a retainer for years after
[01:04:47] <gwozniak> The braces came off just before high school
[01:05:20] <indigo> I got braces as an adult, and then had them taken off after two years. Then I grew a beard. No one recognized me from my work badge photo :P
[01:05:29] <gwozniak> heh
[01:05:50] <indigo> Sorry to hear about the filling man. Hopefully it goes fine and you get numbed
[01:06:01] <gwozniak> My dentist is pretty good
[01:06:20] <indigo> I don't mind getting dental work, I just don't want to feel the pain/get the sweats/shakes that comes with it
[01:06:51] <indigo> That's good! I went to a few shitty dentists in the past; they filled most of my molars due to "microcavities", so now I'm having to get some of those fillings re-done
[01:07:21] <gwozniak> I hope your pain doesn't persist.  imode is correct: if it persists after a day and a bit, get it cleaned up
[01:07:44] <gwozniak> indigo: microcavities are my problem
[01:09:49] <gwozniak> I'm not scared of needles, but by dentist has this technique where he hides the needle behind his back, starts talking to you and then sneaks the needle in without it being obvious that's what he's doing
[01:10:25] <gwozniak> I mean, you feel it, but you kind of don't see it coming, even when you know it's coming
[01:11:24] <indigo> That sucks dude :( but good technique!
[01:12:07] <gwozniak> Brekkjern: I had a flu shot about a month ago and the act of putting in the needle hurt more than usual.  I suspect the person doing it wasn't as skilled as some others that have stuck me in the past :)
[01:12:24] <Brekkjern> Yeah, I bet that really was just the difference
[01:12:29] <Brekkjern> I was just a bit surprised you know :P
[01:12:36] <gwozniak> When I got my covid shots, it was like nothing was happening
[01:13:10] <indigo> I can't really look at the needle going in, but I am ok otherwise
[01:13:23] <manicennui> Yeah, I look away.
[01:13:27] <manicennui> But otherwise don't mind.
[01:13:36] <manicennui> And I can look at it once it is in, like when they take blood.
[01:13:39] <gwozniak> I'll watch it, but looking at it go in my arm is a bit awkward
[01:13:55] <gwozniak> I don't mind watching the needle go in when taking blood
[01:14:06] <manicennui> Many years ago I shadowed one of our ER doctors at work, and he did a spinal tap on a baby and I passed out.
[01:14:19] <manicennui> Ever since then seeing a needle entering has bothered me.
[01:14:39] <manicennui> It's not a conscious thing though.
[01:14:46] <manicennui> I really don't get it.
[01:17:08] <manicennui> Hmm. I really want to buy some land and have a house built, but I also don't want to wait years while I deal with all of that to move, but I also don't want to buy another house in the meantime, and there isn't a lot available to rent in some of these areas.
[01:17:44] <hoistbypetard> manicennui: i have the same tick, but can't pin down why. and every time i look away as the needle goes in, almost without fail, the tech/doctor/nurse inquires about my welfare.
[01:18:24] <manicennui> hoistbypetard: I just never really look in that direction. Just kind of calmly look forward.
[01:19:11] <hoistbypetard> i know someone who lived in a camper on the land they bought for a couple years as the place was getting planned then built.
[01:19:25] <manicennui> Yeah, I've been thinking about things like that.
[01:19:36] <manicennui> A lot of land has restrictions to avoid trailers and RVs and such.
[01:19:46] <manicennui> And trailers and RVs are not at all cheap.
[01:20:22] <manicennui> Some of the places I'm looking also have significant winters.
[01:20:28] <hoistbypetard> for sure. though they hold value well lately.
[01:20:35] <manicennui> Everything is so damn expensive.
[01:20:38] <manicennui> I don't know how people do it.
[01:21:47] <hoistbypetard> we just bought a used trailer for vacations this year... my son is in 4th grade, which means free entry to all national parks. we plan to take advantage, and decided to purchase a trailer for the year, intending to sell at the end of the year.
[01:22:06] <manicennui> Does it have a bathroom?
[01:22:11] <hoistbypetard> no
[01:22:17] <manicennui> Yeah, that makes it much cheaper.
[01:22:18] <hoistbypetard> i specifically didn't want one
[01:22:26] <manicennui> I'm not into shitting in the woods.
[01:22:29] <hoistbypetard> we will be staying in places with nice bath/shower facilities
[01:22:33] <manicennui> I think that would get old fast.
[01:22:38] <hoistbypetard> indeed
[01:22:43] <imode> I wish you were my dad hoistbypetard.
[01:22:51] <manicennui> Maybe he is.
[01:22:59] <imode> but I'm not in 4th grade
[01:23:27] <manicennui> You don't have to be that son.
[01:23:56] <manicennui> You could be the son from his wild days in Maine.
[01:24:03] <hoistbypetard> :). part of our motivation is that it's a nice way to see parks. and part of it is that we're not ready for planes and hotels yet, but camping seems like a nice way to get out and see places
[01:24:03] <manicennui> That he doesn't know he has.
[01:24:24] <manicennui> I always enjoyed camping growing up.
[01:24:26] * hoistbypetard didn't know he had wild days in maine... must've been really wild
[01:24:41] <manicennui> I think kids tolerate the lack of nice facilities a lot more.
[01:24:50] <imode> if I'm adopted they've hidden it very well
[01:24:51] <manicennui> And everything else is super fun.
[01:25:29] <gwozniak> My wife and I try to go camping/hiking at least once a year
[01:25:41] <gwozniak> I still really enjoy it
[01:26:14] <imode> I can't take my wife camping/hiking because of her medical problems, but I'd love to see the national parks.
[01:26:16] <hoistbypetard> we've been camping in a tent a lot the past few years, and it's really cool to see city kids react to nature
[01:26:16] <manicennui> I think most of my problem is that I'm not in shape and my diet is crap.
[01:26:16] <gwozniak> Appreciate the inflatable mattress more now, though
[01:26:23] <manicennui> So things like camping are less enjoyable.
[01:26:44] <imode> manicennui: mood. I weigh 234. I'm 5'11". I gained 10 pounds since winter started.
[01:27:18] <hoistbypetard> gwozniak: one of our main criteria for this trailer (which i expect to sleep in for 20-30 days this year) was a nice queen bed on the grown-up side of it
[01:27:34] <manicennui> How big is it?
[01:27:43] <gwozniak> I have a decent technique for making roasts or a whole chicken in the firepits at Ontario parks, so our first day is always a big meal that provides decent leftovers for 2-3 days
[01:27:52] <manicennui> I love the look of airstreams, but they are now a trendy thing and way overpriced.
[01:28:07] <hoistbypetard> it's about 17 feet long and pops up
[01:28:31] <gwozniak> Other than that, most food we bring is dried in some form
[01:29:06] <hoistbypetard> looks a lot like this: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/JaycoPopupCamper-2009-11-17.jpg
[01:29:41] <manicennui> We had something like that for a bit.
[01:29:43] <hoistbypetard> gwozniak: what's your technique? dutch oven?
[01:30:00] <manicennui> I think my mother and step-father would sleep in it, and we'd sleep in a tent.
[01:31:26] <manicennui> gwozniak: Just bring some live chickens.
[01:31:33] <manicennui> Meat is the main thing that would be problematic.
[01:31:43] <manicennui> Plenty of vegetables would be fine unrefrigerated.

[01:32:26] <buttsbot> Caravel | Travel Trailers | Airstream 16RB, 19CB, 20FB, 22FB
[01:32:28] <hoistbypetard> wow. just looked at airstreams. those have really gotten expensive. i'd excluded them from my search because i didn't want to buy a new vehicle just to tow whatever we got.
[01:32:33] <manicennui> 2022 Caravel starting at $70,500
[01:32:49] <gwozniak> hoistbypetard: we get a pack of hardwood (standard stuff in the parks) and make the fire, which is not too big.  There is a steel grate over half the firepit in the parks here.  I build a small structure around the roast or chicken, which is wrapped in foil ahead of time, so that it is almost completely enclosed in wood, like a little house.  The side facing out above the fire is left open.  It is basically a hardwood oven
[01:33:04] <manicennui> That is probably the smallest one I'd even consider living in for an extended period of time, but it would probably be hard for more than 6 months.
[01:33:24] <hoistbypetard> manicennui: yeah, holy crap. our big purchase was $6000ish.
[01:33:42] <hoistbypetard> and i'm pretty sure i'll be able to sell it for $5900 at the end :)
[01:33:45] <manicennui> And since they are in such demand, used ones aren't super cheap either.
[01:33:48] <gwozniak> The hardwood heats up very nicely and cooks whatever is in there.  then we throw some of the wood in the fire
[01:34:33] <manicennui> I think I'd spatchcock a chicken.
[01:35:21] <gwozniak> It usually takes about 4 or 5 pieces of hardwood, depending on the size
[01:35:22] <hoistbypetard> gwozniak: that sounds like a fun cook, quite apart from the results, which also sound likely to be good
[01:35:56] <gwozniak> It works remarkably well.  We did a whole chicken that way many years ago and it turned out great.  We've done it that way ever since.
[01:36:10] <gwozniak> We did a small beef roast (3lbs.) and it was excellent
[01:36:32] <gwozniak> You can do potatoes that way too, of course
[01:36:58] <gwozniak> We prep the food before we go and cook it on the first or second night, depending on when we get there
[01:38:07] <imode> man I hate it when people cut trees.
[01:38:16] <hoistbypetard> our last time out, we did this: https://www.completelydelicious.com/baking-outside-the-kitchen-easy-dutch-oven-cobbler/ which convinced my kids that camp cooking is superior to what we do at home
[01:38:16] <buttsbot> Easy Dutch Oven Cobbler - Completely Delicious
[01:38:18] <imode> if you like the sound of a chainsaw you're a psychopath.
[01:38:38] <imode> and/or an unhinged serial killer/mass shooter in development.
[01:38:57] <manicennui> We only did basic stuff like hot dogs and smores.
[01:39:10] <companion_cube> or played too much Doom/L4D2/…
[01:39:13] <imode> dutch ovens are the dirty secret of cooking outdoors.
[01:39:17] <gwozniak> hoistbypetard: we don't have a dutch oven for camping, but I'm sure it's amazing
[01:39:28] <imode> that and wrapping stuff in tinfoil
[01:39:36] <manicennui> imode: What's the dirty secret of keeping raw ingredients fresh?
[01:39:45] <hoistbypetard> ice
[01:39:48] <gwozniak> We tend to travel rather light, even when "car camping"
[01:39:48] <imode> ^
[01:39:52] <imode> ice.
[01:39:56] <manicennui> That's the easy but inconvenient way.
[01:40:03] <imode> well, which ingredients.
[01:40:13] <imode> and define fresh.
[01:40:16] <manicennui> Meat, dairy, and (American) eggs.
[01:40:22] <gwozniak> We only take raw ingredients for the first night
[01:40:25] <imode> ^
[01:40:37] <imode> you won't keep them fresh for long.
[01:40:41] <gwozniak> Nope
[01:40:41] <hoistbypetard> it took me years to come around on adding the dutch oven to our setup
[01:40:44] <imode> so get stuff that's cured.
[01:40:52] <imode> bacon is popular for that reason.
[01:40:54] <manicennui> I was hoping imode would recommend hunting/foraging.
[01:41:04] <imode> I ain't recommending something that I can't do.
[01:41:09] <gwozniak> Yeah, bacon is good camp food
[01:41:15] <manicennui> We need a real mountainman.
[01:41:18] <imode> eggs are actually pretty resilient, though.
[01:41:24] <imode> even american ones.
[01:41:32] <gwozniak> Yup.  Eggs will last a few days
[01:41:36] <imode> you can keep supermarket eggs without refrigeration for a long-ass time.
[01:41:42] <manicennui> If you could get the eggs unwashed from the farm, they'd be fine for quite a while.
[01:41:45] <gwozniak> Milk is a no-no, in general
[01:41:45] <imode> hence why eggs, bacon and cured ham.
[01:41:47] <hoistbypetard> i can't hunt, but i can catch and clean a fish. that's good camp food too.
[01:41:50] <manicennui> imode: You are not supposed to in the US.
[01:41:55] <imode> meh.
[01:41:58] <imode> we were fine.
[01:42:00] <manicennui> imode: The washing they do removes the protective coating.
[01:42:02] <riv> hi :)
[01:42:05] <imode> yeah I know.
[01:42:15] <imode> but you'd be surprised how resilient they actually are.
[01:42:20] <imode> if you can keep them steady/stable.
[01:42:22] <imode> or padded.
[01:42:28] <manicennui> Butter doesn't actually need to be refrigerated.
[01:42:36] <manicennui> You can use a butter bell.
[01:42:37] <gwozniak> We don't keep ours in the fridge
[01:43:06] <gwozniak> Bring root vegetables camping.  They will do just fine.
[01:43:09] <hoistbypetard> how long is butter good outside the fridge?
[01:43:09] <imode> butter is refrigerated at the supermarket to keep it solid from the ambient heat.
[01:43:15] <imode> hoistbypetard: like, a long-ass time.
[01:43:16] <manicennui> hoistbypetard: Indefinitely?
[01:43:22] <hoistbypetard> that's something i've never questioned, oddly enough
[01:43:30] <imode> butter and lard are shelf-stable.
[01:43:36] <imode> most fats are.
[01:43:39] <manicennui> Until the fat goes rancid.
[01:43:42] <imode> yeh.
[01:43:47] <gwozniak> Pork fat lasts a long time
[01:43:55] <manicennui> Search for butter bells.
[01:44:03] <gwozniak> We don't clean our cast iron pan for days sometimes
[01:44:08] <imode> there's a common technique where you seal a pot of meat or other things you want to preserve with fat.
[01:44:13] <gwozniak> Just to keep the fat in it
[01:44:28] <imode> and by "pot" I mean jar or something similar.
[01:44:33] <imode> prior to hermetic seals that's how you did it.
[01:48:11] <hoistbypetard> i keep a jar of bacon fat on the counter. it just never occurred to me that butter was not fundamentally different from that.
[01:48:24] <imode> yeah dude!
[01:48:31] <imode> we keep a stick of butter out for purposes.
[01:48:35] <manicennui> I didn't even think about the fact that you could can some meat and such.
[01:48:49] <imode> any cured meat will last far longer than you'd expect.
[01:48:54] <imode> that and sausages.
[01:48:59] <manicennui> I mean uncured.
[01:49:02] <imode> ah.
[01:49:04] <imode> yeah you can do that.
[01:49:14] <manicennui> Like you could can some beef stew or whatever.
[01:49:19] <manicennui> Heat it up while camping.
[01:50:13] <imode> that's why we keep a lot of canned goods ready.
[01:50:35] <manicennui> Depending on what you want to use it for, you could bring some non-dairy milk.
[01:50:42] <bkero> When I go camping for a few days I typically cut up all the vegetables and soaked chilies, add them to a mason jar with all the other bits, then cut up the short rib and sausage when I'm there and have another mason jar of beans.
[01:50:49] <bkero> Combine and simmer on a camp fire in a dutch oven for most of a day
[01:51:03] <imode> I wonder how long oat milk would last?
[01:51:05] <bkero> https://www.seriouseats.com/campfire-chili-in-a-dutch-oven-recipe
[01:51:06] <buttsbot> Campfire Chili in a Dutch Oven Recipe
[01:51:13] <bkero> This worked great and fed 6 people for 3 days
[01:51:14] <manicennui> imode: Months before you open it.
[01:51:26] <imode> manicennui: how about after.
[01:51:30] <manicennui> Not sure.
[01:51:41] <manicennui> It recommends refrigerating it, but I'm not sure whether it actually goes bad.
[01:51:51] <imode> someone wanna launch an experiment. :P
[01:51:54] <companion_cube> refrigerated, a few weeks I'd say
[01:51:57] <manicennui> I'd definitely be willing to risk it after a day or two.
[01:51:59] <companion_cube> unrefrigerated, idk.
[01:52:09] <imode> what's in there to spoil?
[01:57:09] <manicennui> Is botulism a concern?
[01:58:14] <companion_cube> idk, maybe it's not nutritious enough to sustain anything… but even water will develop interesting life
[01:58:53] <manicennui> Botulism develops in oxygen free environments, which is why it is a concern in canning.
[01:59:05] <manicennui> The bacteria that creates the toxin is all over.
[01:59:42] <manicennui> Wondering whether closing up the oat milk would create an environment where it could form.
[01:59:55] <manicennui> Not sure why refrigeration is generally a counter to it for opened food.
[02:00:31] <ngoldbaum> oat milk lasts a couple weeks after opening it
[02:00:49] <manicennui> ngoldbaum: We were discussing not refrigerating it.
[02:00:51] <manicennui> After opening it.
[02:01:17] <ngoldbaum> yeah it goes in the fridge
[02:02:01] <manicennui> Yeah, the question is why it wouldn't be safe to drink like a day or two later if not refrigerated.
[02:02:09] <companion_cube> a few days is probably ok
[02:02:36] <ngoldbaum> because there’s bacteria and mold in the air
[02:02:58] <ngoldbaum> and it’s basically a sugar emulsion
[02:03:13] <manicennui> Sure, but is it so bad that even if the oat milk smells okay, you shouldn't drink it?
[02:03:18] <manicennui> Or is it just being cautious?
[02:03:37] <manicennui> Or a ploy by big oat!
[02:04:59] <manicennui> I don't think anyone here is planning to actually drink unrefrigerated previously opened oat milk.
[02:05:10] <manicennui> Just curious about the actual science.
[02:05:44] <manicennui> Like I'd eat pizza that had been left out overnight.
[02:06:02] <ngoldbaum> i mean, you do you
[02:06:20] <companion_cube> I do it, too
[02:06:24] <manicennui> Not that I make it a habit.
[02:06:25] <companion_cube> it horrified a bit my fiancée
[02:06:25] <imode> why wouldn't you.
[02:06:32] <imode> food does not spoil that quickly.
[02:06:42] <manicennui> I can't actually remember doing it at any particular point.
[02:06:45] <imode> cultures take time to grow.
[02:07:06] <imode> am I gonna cook chicken that's been left out overnight? no. am I gonna eat something cooked that's been left out overnight? yeah.
[02:07:13] <manicennui> I probably wouldn't drink dairy milk that had been left out overnight.
[02:07:47] <companion_cube> milk, I agree
[02:07:52] <bkero> Not with that attitude
[02:07:58] <companion_cube> cooked pizza without meat, I'm ok with it
[02:08:13] <manicennui> I'm sure leaving milk out is how we got some dairy products though.
[02:08:18] <gwozniak> companion_cube: same
[02:08:37] <imode> cooked pizza with pepperoni?
[02:08:42] <imode> that stuff can be left out freely.
[02:08:45] <companion_cube> once we'd cooked some mean, cheese heavy, mushroom lasagna, and forgot to put the leftovers in the fridge
[02:08:56] <companion_cube> I didn't eat them beause of my fiancée and it was so, so sad
[02:09:22] <gwozniak> I did that with a stew.  I left it on the stove :(
[02:09:36] <imode> bruh
[02:09:41] <gwozniak> And I was a new student and didn't have much food money, so that was a total waste
[02:09:44] <imode> that's totally safe to eat.
[02:09:49] <ngoldbaum> Brekkjern: u ded yet
[02:09:53] <ngoldbaum> https://twitter.com/galgracen/status/1479568620501934080
[02:09:53] <buttsbot> Twitter - galgracen - got my booster at the italian cultural center and they literally make you sit and watch a video of a guy stirring red sauce after you get your shot https://t.co/36FN8NvaVQ
[02:09:54] <gwozniak> No, it smelled bad
[02:09:57] <companion_cube> imode: well it was overnight, and full of dairy
[02:10:01] * imode shrugs.
[02:10:02] <companion_cube> but damn
[02:10:02] <manicennui> After one night?
[02:10:04] <Brekkjern> ngoldbaum: Sadly, no.
[02:10:07] <imode> we've left fettuccine out overnight.
[02:10:10] <imode> it's fine.
[02:10:21] <ngoldbaum> rip imode
[02:10:28] <imode> cheese and shit is safe to leave out, it's already cultured. what's it gonna do.
[02:10:31] <companion_cube> yeah I think I'd eat it if it happened again
[02:10:33] <ngoldbaum> hello ghost of imode
[02:10:33] <imode> anything cooked can survive a night out.
[02:10:40] <companion_cube> especially since it's really an awesome dish
[02:11:15] <gwozniak> My dad cooked and at ham that had turned a light shade of green once.  That did not end well.
[02:11:20] <gwozniak> *ate
[02:11:37] <imode> tbf that's the line.
[02:11:43] <manicennui> Sure, I won't eat things with obvious signs of decay.
[02:11:45] <imode> light shade of _green_.
[02:11:47] <imode> damn.
[02:11:56] <manicennui> Smell, mold, etc.
[02:12:09] <manicennui> Hard to tell with blue cheese...
[02:12:11] <companion_cube> hey, potatoes with a tiny bit of green are fine
[02:12:26] <imode> meat on the other hand.
[02:12:37] <imode> blue cheese never goes bad until it starts getting black mold on it.
[02:12:39] <manicennui> Probably fine, but the green is slightly toxic.
[02:13:01] <manicennui> On potatoes that is.
[02:13:03] <gwozniak> mold on cheese and bread?  I'm fine with scraping it off and probably toasting the bread
[02:13:13] <manicennui> You are also not supposed to eat potatoes if the eyes grow.
[02:13:15] <gwozniak> unless it's clerly taken over the bread
[02:13:25] <imode> active mold on things that should not have mold is where I draw the line.
[02:13:27] <manicennui> On hard cheese, sure.
[02:13:48] <manicennui> Imagine how much mold our ancestors ate.
[02:13:48] <ngoldbaum> itt: people eating iffy food
[02:14:09] * ngoldbaum cracks open some natto
[02:14:46] <manicennui> It's just so weird to me that we can also do things like sourdough starter and it is fine.
[02:14:57] <manicennui> Obviously it can go bad, but it can also be fine for years.
[02:15:16] <gwozniak> All I know is that best before dates have ruined many people's ability to judge when food is actually not edible or actively bad for you
[02:15:19] <ngoldbaum> lactobacillus creates a ton of lactic scid and kills everything else
[02:15:57] * manicennui adds lactobacillus to the oat milk
[02:15:58] <gwozniak> Now, I'm off to eat some cookie dough! ;)
[02:16:03] <imode> oh my god
[02:16:17] <imode> an automated scam caller regarding irs debt or whatever called just now
[02:16:28] <manicennui> Ah, that will probably be starting up again.
[02:16:29] <imode> and I said in the most demonic robotic voice possible "I will eat your children with barbecue sauce"
[02:16:31] <manicennui> It is that time of year.
[02:16:34] <companion_cube> I mean, I also eat a tiny bit of mix with one egg in it
[02:16:37] <imode> "Thank you! You have been added to our do not call list."
[02:16:42] <companion_cube> :D
[02:16:43] <manicennui> heh
[02:16:50] <ngoldbaum> imode is a ghost confirmed
[02:16:54] <imode> wife and i fucking choked laughing
[02:17:12] <manicennui> If I don't know the number on my work phone, I have Google's call screening answer it, and they never seem to respond.
[02:22:06] <manicennui> https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/three-men-convicted-murdering-ahmaud-arbery-sentenced-life-prison-rcna10901
[02:22:06] <buttsbot> Three men convicted of murdering Ahmaud Arbery sentenced to life in prison
[02:24:46] <defect> and only one with a chance of parole
[02:28:22] <companion_cube> yeah, that's good news
[02:32:49] <defect> seemed pretty clear cut to me, but you never know
[02:36:15] <companion_cube> chasing a guy for *5* minutes should never ever qualify as self defense
[02:37:58] <defect> unarmed guy too
[02:38:27] <defect> was that the defence's argument?
[02:41:11] <manicennui> Without the video they would probably be free.
[02:41:34] <manicennui> defect: Basically that he was a scary black buy and their dumb clients were sure he had done something wrong.
[02:41:43] <manicennui> And once they were sure of that, killing him was the only solution.
[02:42:05] <companion_cube> I'm sure they were shouting "stop, this is a citizen's arrest!"
[02:42:18] <companion_cube> which is very reassuring when you're chasing by gun totting men in cars
[02:42:41] <manicennui> At the point that they shot him he wasn't even a threat.
[02:42:47] <manicennui> They just wanted to kill him.
[02:42:51] <manicennui> Hopefully they are killed in jail.
[02:48:03] <kline> increased video surveillance has absolutely been a cracker for recent shooting cases
[02:48:11] <kline> and thankfully none of them have been mass surveillance
[02:51:00] <manicennui> Video equipment is biased against the white man
[02:51:31] <kline> on the contrary, it cleared a white man the other month
[02:51:35] <kline> (correctly)
[02:51:43] <kline> and convicted 3 white men today (also correct)
[02:54:09] <manicennui> I was obviously joking.
[02:54:43] <manicennui> But I can only imagine the mental gymnastics that people use to justify why we shouldn't have more video evidence, including all police interactions, interrogations, etc.
[02:58:44] <manicennui> We've also let gun crazy nuts kill people over shit with minimal consequences for far too long.
[02:59:15] <manicennui> Using a firearm should require a high burden of proof that someone's life was in immediate danger, and not just because some asshole brought a gun to intimidate someone, then the person fought back and they got scared.
[02:59:31] <manicennui> Such a fucking stupid country.
[03:00:03] <imode> just get rid of guns.
[03:00:08] <imode> like, everywhere.
[03:00:13] <imode> outlaw them worldwide.
[03:00:33] <imode> in what world would there be a negative.
[03:00:39] <manicennui> But my FREEDUMB!
[03:00:55] <manicennui> For hunting too?
[03:00:58] <imode> yup.
[03:01:02] <imode> get rid of guns for the police, too.
[03:01:07] <imode> literally abolish the concept of a gun.
[03:01:25] <imode> not projectile weaponry! that's impossible. but the concept of modern firearm.
[03:02:40] <companion_cube> lol good luck :D
[03:02:46] <companion_cube> how do you enforce that
[03:02:55] <imode> assume the hypothetical that you could.
[03:03:03] <imode> would it address the issues we're seeing.
[03:03:18] <companion_cube> ah well, sure
[03:03:26] <companion_cube> nothiing between the knife, and the tank :D
[03:03:37] <imode> tanks are outlawed too, they are a form of gun.
[03:04:02] <imode> actually, that's interesting. they're a form of cannon.
[03:04:07] <imode> would they be subject to a ban?
[03:04:21] <imode> I feel like yes, because the average person isn't going to own artillary.
[03:04:41] <imode> and you aren't going to sell someone an anti-air battery. :P
[03:14:50] <Brekkjern> Bleh. Now my arm is starting to go a bit numb :(
[03:15:00] <Brekkjern> Not too bad. Haven't taken painkillers yet, but it's still annoying
[03:15:37] <skyl4rk> and somewhere in the background David Gilmour starts playing guitar
[03:15:52] <imode> numb?!
[03:15:55] <imode> that is not a good thing.
[03:16:10] <Brekkjern> lol

[03:23:14] <Brekkjern> Also, my poor CPU and GPU :S
[03:23:21] <companion_cube> I mean, I assumed skyl4rk was referring to the Wall :)
[03:23:33] <Brekkjern> No idea :P
[03:23:54] <skyl4rk> unless gilmour was in austin powers?
[03:24:39] <Brekkjern> I was thinking of this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju1UwmgkKgI

[03:40:53] <imode> oh shiIT
[03:41:04] <imode> have you already rebooted.
[03:41:15] <imode> can you copy stuff from /tmp
[03:41:20] <companion_cube> do you even git, bro? :D
[03:41:21] <skyl4rk> no, fortunately I did notice
[03:41:35] <imode> good.
[03:41:45] <skyl4rk> (no=I have not already rebooted, all was re-saveable at ~)
[03:42:20] <imode> fun fact: if you had a liveCD handy, you could've copied the /tmp files over to your root partition.
[03:43:10] <skyl4rk> and still lost them I assume? (ramdisk)
[03:43:21] <skyl4rk> gotta upload to the  c l o u d
[03:43:22] <imode> they should be persisted until your bootup clears them out.
[03:43:37] <imode> unless it's tmpfs.
[03:43:57] <manicennui> I think he means mount / from the real install and put them there.
[03:44:06] <skyl4rk> ah
[03:44:07] <manicennui> Not / on the live system.
[03:44:14] <imode> yeah.
[03:44:42] <manicennui> How well is /tmp cleaned at boot?
[03:44:58] <imode> if it's tmpfs then it's all temporary storage.

[03:50:12] <companion_cube> they're pretty ok, I think (I haven't eaten real meat in years so I'm not going to pretend it's the same)
[03:50:24] <imode> is there a good chicken analogue right now?
[03:52:41] <companion_cube> I have no idea :s
[03:52:55] <companion_cube> I think there's _some_ replacement for bacon, but haven't tried
[03:53:24] <imode> if I can have a decent replacement for chicken I can start making tandoori not-chicken!
[03:53:52] <manicennui> companion_cube: You are vegan?
[03:54:32] <companion_cube> just vegetarian :)
[03:55:03] <bkero> why try for not-chicken if you can just have paneer?
[03:55:12] <wrl> ^
[03:55:22] <imode> because I'd need a LOT of paneer.

[03:58:11] <companion_cube> 🙄
[03:59:21] <imode> they were probably vaccinated, too.
[03:59:55] <imode> so, paneer is $6.99/12oz
[04:00:32] <imode> I'd need to buy $21 worth of paneer for a single meal. that isn't that bad, actually. might try this.
[04:01:00] <indigo> Seems kinda pricey for paneer
[04:01:13] <imode> that's the only paneer I can get.
[04:01:17] <indigo> Hell, whole foods does $6.49 for 14oz
[04:02:39] <imode> jfc one of these places charges $10/lb
[04:07:34] <imode> costco has good paneer prices.
[04:10:57] <indigo> What are you making with it?
[04:11:14] <imode> tandoori paneer.
[04:11:40] <imode> I usually do 2 pounds of chicken thighs and 3 cups of rice to go along with it. marinate the thighs overnight, it'll last me like 2-3 days.
[04:11:42] <imode> maybe longer.

[07:00:07] <imode> I feel like Rust's path isn't similar to C's, which saw pretty heavy usage with libraries like Allegro and SDL and all the fun stuff that Windows includes for graphics, sound, windowing, etc. and I don't know why. if it's a better language, are people not flocking to it? why was C popular?
[07:03:09] <manicennui> Because our entire industry depends on C ABIs.
[07:03:40] <imode> guess it's gonna stay that way at this rate.
[07:03:50] <manicennui> I'm sure C was pretty amazing when it was first created, compared to everything else.
[07:04:09] <manicennui> The whole "portable assembly" thing.
[07:05:02] <manicennui> But we should have done something better as hardware improved.
[07:05:16] <companion_cube> manicennui: it was not
[07:05:27] <companion_cube> there were already a lot of better, safer, cleaner languages
[07:05:27] <imode> pascal was better at the time.
[07:05:40] <manicennui> companion_cube: Sure, but how was their performance on hardware at the time?
[07:05:48] <companion_cube> pascal is reasonably efficient
[07:06:02] <companion_cube> afaict, C won because it worked on low end machines, and (I think) because it got free compilers quickly
[07:06:13] <companion_cube> unlike others who kept expensive proprietary compilers forever

[07:08:30] <manicennui> I don't even know how anyone could change the situation now without a massive effort.
[07:08:42] <companion_cube> I think it's already changing :)
[07:08:43] <manicennui> You'd need someone like Google to create a new OS from the ground up.
[07:08:54] <manicennui> And I don't trust any of the companies that have the resources to do it.
[07:08:59] <companion_cube> I'm hoping that C is on a down slope
[07:09:01] <manicennui> companion_cube: Is it?
[07:09:09] <manicennui> companion_cube: At the ABI level?
[07:09:19] <manicennui> Seems like we are just replacing higher layers.
[07:09:24] <imode> I hate that we're somehow dependent on C's ABIs. I should not need bindings to SDL to do useful graphical things, they should be commands I issue to a GPU.
[07:09:35] <imode> why did older hardware understand that.
[07:13:07] <companion_cube> the ABI will be forever, I think
[07:13:10] <companion_cube> C doesn't need to be
[07:13:21] <companion_cube> you can have any two languages talk via the C ABI, without any C
[07:13:32] <imode> blechagghehch.
[07:13:43] <companion_cube> 🤷
[07:14:03] <manicennui> We need a new kernel that requires everything to talk to everything else with JSON
[07:14:09] <companion_cube> ahah nooooo
[07:14:38] <imode> I'd take that tbf.
[07:14:40] <manicennui> I'm joking, but it would be really cool if everything was message based.
[07:16:23] <imode> would be nice, yeah. all I want to do is build my own tiny computing platform inside of these large, lumbering architectural beasts.
[07:16:27] <manicennui> I wonder how fast you could make such a system.
[07:16:39] <manicennui> Like could you use modern hardware to make it as fast as a computer from 15 years ago?
[07:16:41] <manicennui> 10 years ago?
[07:16:50] <imode> definitely.
[07:17:09] <manicennui> imode: That's why I find BEAM very intriguing.
[07:17:33] <manicennui> And there are a few alternative languages for it.
[07:17:49] <imode> yeah that's very near a freestanding environment, most VM-based ecosystems do.
[07:19:36] <imode> s/do/are
[07:26:18] <companion_cube> sure, message based, but not json plz
[07:28:48] <manicennui> imode: Make it happen on top of AWS!
[07:28:54] <manicennui> New service.
[07:29:18] <manicennui> Maybe something like that already exists. I don't keep up with all of the things they offer at all.

[21:09:53] <imode> why are people so quick to legitimize "web3" in the same way they seek to legitimize "metaverse". all of these terms are being pushed by grifters.
[21:10:32] <imode> like, the article on the front page is nothing. it might as well be a blank page once you understand that web3 is not a valid term.
[21:10:36] <epilys> they want some of that spotlight
[21:11:03] <imode> you can change the name but you can't change the content.
[21:11:13] <imode> and I refuse to tolerate the name change.
[21:11:32] <imode> anybody trying to have a conversation about web3 is just trying to push for a term and a concept that doesn't exist.
[21:11:33] <prussian> didn't you answer your own question? lol
[21:12:06] <imode> yeah, probably. still pissed about it though.
