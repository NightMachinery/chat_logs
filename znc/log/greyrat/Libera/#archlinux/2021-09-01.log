[02:05:02] <vindicator> I'm a mess when it comes to globbing. I know I encountered a similar problem before, but don't remember the details. I'm trying to correct a pacman database duplication deal caused by a couple of copies (my fault I'm sure), and thought I'd correct it with a simple script:
[02:05:08] <vindicator> for eachPkg in $(cat duplicate.log); do yes '' | sudo pacman -v -S --overwrite "*" $eachPkg; done
[02:05:18] *** Joins: dutch (~DutchIngr@user/dutch)
[02:05:50] <vindicator> The thing is, that --overwrite works with the first package, but fails on subsequent ones, and I'm pretty darn sure it's the glob.
[02:07:10] <thurstylark> a few things on that line...
[02:07:26] <thurstylark> first, pacman can take multiple arguments, so probably not much use for the for loop
[02:07:52] <thurstylark> second, pacman has --noconfirm, so piping yes in to the whole thing isn't necessary

[03:44:49] <Nitrousoxide> The truth is the person with physical access to the computer doesnt know much about Linux at all, so it will be extremely painful if he has to physically intervene 
[03:45:04] <Nitrousoxide> ectospasm: How?
[03:45:12] <ectospasm> Nitrousoxide: do you know how much RAM this system has?
[03:45:34] <Nitrousoxide> Definitely enough for an install ISO if thats what you're getting at

[03:45:43] <Nitrousoxide> I'll SSH in and check right now.

[03:53:15] <jonet> I can confirm it's still the same though.

[04:10:02] <rabbitnightmare> is 2021.09.01 going to have kernel 5.14?
[04:10:07] <ectospasm> Nitrousoxide: so, I forgot to ask, is this system behind NAT?
[04:10:16] <Scimmia> rabbitnightmare: no
[04:10:22] <Nitrousoxide> ectospasm: Yes, a very strict and annoying one.
[04:10:31] <rabbitnightmare> Scimmia: cool so my arch USB survives another month
[04:10:33] <Nitrousoxide> Thats why the sshd port is the way it is
[04:10:40] <ectospasm> Nitrousoxide: so is sshd configured with a nonstandard port?
[04:10:46] <rabbitnightmare> I usually only make a new one with a kernel update
[04:10:47] <Nitrousoxide> Yes
[04:11:04] <Nitrousoxide> You wouldnt believe the convincing it took just to get any port open for sshd

[04:11:28] <Nitrousoxide> I mean I could've upnp'd but that's dishonest 
[04:11:32] <ectospasm> Does it forward to port 22 on the system?  Seems like that would be the easiest thing.
[04:11:38] <Nitrousoxide> It does not
[04:11:53] <ectospasm> So it just forwards whatever port to the same port on the machine behind NAT.
[04:12:03] <Nitrousoxide> Correct
[04:12:11] <Nitrousoxide> And changing this is not an option, at all
[04:12:38] <ectospasm> OK, so yeah, roll your own archiso and change the sshd port, then you'll be able to do the install remotely.
[04:13:12] <Nitrousoxide> Okay so once that's done, then what?
[04:13:24] <Nitrousoxide> burn it to a blank flashdrive using Ubuntu?
[04:13:41] <Nitrousoxide> Ideally I won't need the flashdrive at all but if I must I'll cave
[04:13:52] <ectospasm> Or however your onsite contact is comfortable to boot the system off the archiso.

[04:14:19] <Nitrousoxide> well the idea is to avoid the onsite contact, but again, if I must I can.
[04:14:55] <Nitrousoxide> `cd` and `tmux attach` is frankly the extent of his Linux knowledge 
[04:15:02] <ectospasm> How else are you going to boot this system?  On the Dell systems I manage, I can boot off of a virtual ISO using the iDRAC, but I don't think you have that luxury.

[04:21:08] <ectospasm> So yeah, /dev/sda1 is your boot partition, and you only have the one Linux partition.
[04:21:47] <Nitrousoxide> I'm not afraid of overwriting the boot partition, if that would help

[23:26:41] <Forty-Bot> Hello71: I'm not interested in using nix
[23:26:53] <jelle> Forty-Bot: anyway you can use source=('.') probably in your pkgbuild :-)
[23:27:05] <jelle> or as Namarrgon said file:////
[23:27:06] <Forty-Bot> that's pretty dirty, but I like it
[23:27:15] <Repentinus> You can use an empty source array too.
[23:27:24] <jelle> Forty-Bot: how is that dirty?
[23:27:39] <Hello71> jelle: but the debian model is "patch debian/ into the source". even if it's theoretically equivalent to other models, the "ecosystem" is centered around this concept

[23:41:32] <mnd999_> I think I ended up using systemd-boot for that, it's a faff to get it to work
[23:42:04] <mnd999_> And I still have a manual shell script to update the tpm after kernel update

[23:45:40] <grazzolini> Forty-Bot: you just might want to add a prepare() for setting pkgver though, because for mkinitcpio that's handled by the Makefile.

[23:45:59] <Forty-Bot> yeah, I think the standard git version one will work for me

[23:54:30] <Mysterytrain> that's hwat I did
[23:55:08] <Mysterytrain> i'm not gonna have some silly motherboard tell me what operating systems are worthy of being installed
[23:56:01] <aphirst> lol, idk i don't object to the concept, though i'd prefer at least that the master key not be microsoft, but the mobo manufacturer

[23:58:07] <mnd999_> It's kinda useful though if you use luks and store the decryption key in the tpm you can have a fairly secure system at rest. But yes, use your own boot keys
[23:58:19] <Foxboron> aphirst: fwiw, if the issue was that grub was telling you the "nobody cares" command it's because (again) grub is complicated
[23:58:31] <Foxboron> you need to embed all modules you are going to use into the .efi binary when building it.
[23:58:44] <Foxboron> mnd999_: You can't, sometimes. Which is the important note
[23:59:04] <ioistired> i installed community/ttf-joypixels but certain emojis render in a monochrome font still, such as 😳, in firefox. i assume this has something to do with font priorities. is there a way i can set my emoji font to be top priority so that emojis always render in color when available?
[23:59:40] <Mysterytrain> I don't have ./kernel/tpm anything lol
[23:59:53] <aphirst> i didn't even know you could do it through the tpm
