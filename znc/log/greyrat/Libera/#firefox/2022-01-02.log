[00:34:45] <ede> zoomed in and the desktop clock started to jump again. clicked the x to close.
[00:35:16] <ede> the area around the x was greyed, so the press was definitely registered
[00:35:34] <dalias> nobody wants notifications
[00:35:39] <dalias> especially on a site they *closed*
[00:35:57] <dalias> just entirely a misfeature for malware/spam
[00:36:08] <ede> later the tab header disappeared, the tab on its left didn't scroll right. even the title did change, but the animation still went on
[00:37:04] <ede> so when i want to get rid of a page/tab i have to kill it from extern?
[00:37:35] <ede> wtf i have entries in serviceworkers i can't even remember i've been on the site
[00:37:47] <ede> and i restart multiple times per day usually
[00:37:53] <dalias> yep
[00:37:55] <ede> only way to get firefox to return memory
[00:38:03] <dalias> serviceworkers are persistent across browser sessions
[00:38:13] <dalias> it's literally a backdoor for malicious sites to persist
[00:38:23] <ede> wtf do they sniff at mozilla?
[00:38:29] <dalias> thereby tracking you, running cryptominers, etc.
[00:38:39] <dalias> google is the one who pushed this shit into web standards
[00:38:51] <dalias> mozilla just implemented the monster google created
[00:39:02] <ede> seems firefox there days (and i'm not even on a recent version) should be used for single webpages only
[00:39:14] <ede> read it, close it, open a new instance with the next page
[00:39:24] <dalias> and unlike firefox, chrome has no way to turn it off except chattr +i a file over top of the serviceworkers dir in the profile dir so that it encounters an error trying to write serviceworkers
[00:40:17] <dalias> but yeah, on firefox, dom.serviceWorkers.enabled=false fixes it
[00:40:26] <ede> firefox needs this too, but for save directories
[00:40:37] <dalias> ?
[00:40:44] <ede> i remember i tested some things after i found out i have not the slightest clue how it decides where to save things
[00:41:00] <ede> but it seems possible to have different directories for different things somehow
[00:41:31] <ede> tried to save images one by one from a page, suddenly it recreated Downloads and saved it there
[00:41:40] <ede> i removed it again, then it turned to Desktop
[00:41:44] <dalias> ...
[00:41:54] <ede> totally ignoring the directory it used to save the first files
[00:42:31] <ede> and saving a file in another directory than the one opened after C-s is... hard
[00:42:36] <ede> Gtk is pure crap
[00:42:42] <ede> Gtk3 even more
[00:43:15] <ede> i can't even get it to have some sane filtering and sorting in the dialog
[00:44:19] <ede> anyway, no serviceworker for THAT site or page or w/e
[00:47:36] <ede> what are serviceworkers even good for? wasting ressources?

[01:30:58] <dalias> "making your experience better" is dark-pattern wording for when you want to avoid specifics because if anyone knew the specifics, they'd be completely against it
[01:31:46] <dalias> moreover, i have never seen even a *single example* of serviceworkers being used for something that benefits the user
[01:32:09] <ede> susi: reasonable standards. sometimes a defined subset is a better solution anyway.
[01:32:18] <ede> PDF-X or PDF-A, which one was it?
[01:32:30] <dalias> and there is no remotely plausible argument that they could be for a site that you don't regularly use much less even recognize

[01:33:33] <dalias> all sorts of random shit staying open but hiding the window and moving to the tray when you try to close it
[01:33:36] <dalias> rather than actually closing
[01:33:45] <ede> also i can't remember tabs popping up after start advertizing some mozilla services
[01:33:52] <dalias> and NOBODY WANTS THAT
[01:33:58] <dalias> it has absolutely never been for the user's benefit
[01:34:36] <ede> i had some gui program open these days, i think some editor. "close window" instead of "exit". srsly?
[01:35:27] <ede> asides from the obvious media player a browser and an irc client are the only gui things i use daily.
[01:35:40] <dalias> at best it's been assuming that your software/service/website is the most important thing on the user's pc and that you care more about it coming back up instantly when they run it again than about being able to run anything else (but even that's flawed since, when you tie up all the memory and make it swap to hell, you'll swap to hell again swapping back in and take longer than just restarting properly)
[01:36:05] <ede> and the one is mpv, so gui only if i open a video, not for audio. and the other one could be replaced bei irssi/weechat. text only after all.
[01:36:23] <ede> microsoft and the IE
[01:36:41] <ede> start half of it during login and ofc it appears faster than firefox and opera
[01:37:48] <ede> dalias: yep. since i discovered pluto.tv (which i have to run in the browser it seems) i grant it an extra window, but even before closing firefox i press alt+home in it. it's just faster.
[01:38:25] <ede> one of the most idiotic things popping up over the last 10 years or so was doing everything in parallel. including booting linux.
[01:39:00] <ede> i remember i had to restart de rebooting more than once because of the network card not being ready yet when the drivers popped up
[01:39:19] <dalias> ?
[01:39:42] <ede> for firefox it means i have a lot of home tabs sometimes just to avoid some webpage loading i'm not interested in
[01:40:32] <dalias> anyway yeah boot process as a dependencyc tree of services is so ridiculous and slow

[13:18:31] <W> for that one site, sure
[13:18:48] <W> you'll still be asked to consent on a different one
[13:19:10] <ede> i doubt that even most "necessary" cookies are really necessary. not to talk about "legitime interest". that one is just an euphemism for "we don't care about your consumer rights".
[13:20:22] <W> basically legitimate interests are what they would claim to _not_ ask explicit consent - if they ask for consent it's because they don't fill any of the law's other possible causes for storing personal information
[13:20:24] <ede> as it was mentioned before here in another context, people talking about UX all the time don't care at all about it.
[13:20:45] <ede> they don't for those, you just can't uncheck them.
[13:21:06] <labrador> You don't need to fill those up
[13:21:12] <W> I don't think that's really true. I mean, sure, there's a lot of fakers, but much more it's just that the people that care about the users aren't in a position to make decisions
[13:21:17] <labrador> Just use ublock origin

[13:22:15] <labrador> nice
[13:22:40] <ede> do they also fix things like having no scrollbar until the dialog is passed and such?
[13:22:46] <W> but I was originally commenting on someone saying they wanted to /accept/ all - by blocking the consent forms and such, basically the sight has no legal grounds to track, so it's the same as denying
[13:22:54] <W> *the site
[13:23:34] <ede> it's just one of at least 3 dialogs appearing on most site these days. and accepting all is the easy way. ony click and they won't bother you anymore.
[13:23:35] <W> ede, in time; like most useful things, these lists are maintained by volunteers, the community, and quality improves over time as people fix
[13:24:05] <W> umatrix just blocks everything if you like however (including the things the site needs to otherwise work so...)
[13:24:07] <ede> next they'll ask you to push messages, then to create an account, eventually also geoip.
[13:24:23] <W> eh you're using the wrong sites, too
[13:24:46] <ede> and then the ubiquituous mid-column wide video on top which switches to miniplayer the moment you scroll down.
[13:25:01] <ede> it's most of the corporate web
[13:25:30] <ede> for the latter just check fandom.com
[13:25:49] <ede> unfortunately it pops up all the time when you look for something TV

[13:39:35] <ede> depends, sometimes one just needs some source going deeper. some projects on it aren't that bad, but the site really sucks
[13:40:02] <ede> for things like star trek there's of course a lot of other options... alpha and beta memory, chakoteya, ...
