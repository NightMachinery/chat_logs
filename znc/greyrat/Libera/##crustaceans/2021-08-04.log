[02:21:22] <Brekkjern> Prolly gotta expand the comment by soc to see it
[02:21:37] <Brekkjern> They deleted it after they got the reaming they deserved
[02:26:38] <companion_cube> I like Calvin 's comment on plugging holes in the boat
[02:29:31] <Brekkjern> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[02:30:10] <Brekkjern> I don't really care much for Rust either way. I'd like to learn it one day in the future when I need something as low level as that, but for now I am doing fine with Python for the most part.
[02:30:46] <Brekkjern> I'm just not naive enough to think it is a perfect replacement without any drawbacks in all situations
[02:30:48] <riv> I did a little rust and it's so difficult
[02:31:05] <riv> i always have issues with &str vs String
[02:32:02] <Church> Honestly a lot of the time just eat the allocation and to_string()/as-string() between the types as needed
[02:32:07] <Church> Much easier to deal with
[02:32:18] <Church> as_string()*
[02:33:05] * goodger[m] twitches
[02:33:59] <Church> goodger[m]: Hmm?
[02:34:47] <companion_cube> riv: it's more explicit than the C version where you don't know who is responsible for deallocating
[02:35:08] <companion_cube> I kind of hope new languages with better ergonomics are going to appear
[02:35:20] <goodger[m]> python 4?
[02:35:24] <companion_cube> But they'll be closer to rust than to C, that ship has sailed
[02:35:54] <Church> Finally figuring out generics today, so I can write a func excepting either a TcpStream or a TlsStream<TcpStream>
[02:35:58] <Church> That was nice.
[02:36:09] <Church> accepting*
[02:36:11] <companion_cube> Python 4? Yikes
[02:36:27] <companion_cube> I also hope something better than python appears :p
[02:36:44] <goodger[m]> that has happened a fair few times

[21:18:29] <companion_cube> if I wanted a compact android phone
[21:18:36] <companion_cube> would anyone have a recommendation? :s
[21:19:07] <cb> i think sony is the only real one making anything close to worthwhile for smol anroid
[21:19:14] <cb> apple basically owns this niche tbh
[21:19:23] <cb> the 12 mini is still kind of a big phone to me
[21:19:30] <companion_cube> I do have an Xperia X compact, but it's kind of dying
[21:19:30] <cb> but it's MUCH smaller than the flagships nowadays
[21:19:59] <companion_cube> yeah but I've been told that if I didn't like the walled garden, I shouldn't buy apple, so… 🤷
[21:21:35] <Brekkjern> I have a Pixel 3a and I'm fairly happy with that one
[21:21:59] <Brekkjern> Not sure how it stacks up with what you think of as compact though
[21:22:01] <companion_cube> do they still make these?
[21:22:04] <companion_cube> heh
[21:22:06] <Brekkjern> No idea. Probably not :P
[21:22:22] <wrl> companion_cube: there's the current asus zenfone but it's €€€
[21:22:33] <companion_cube> my screen is 4.6" Brekkjern
[21:22:38] <companion_cube> it fits in the pocket nicely
[21:23:00] <Brekkjern> Well, the 3a is 5.6"
[21:23:03] <cb> i wish my 12 mini were smaller
[21:23:39] <Brekkjern> The 5 is 6", so that one is probably a bit larger than what you want?
[21:24:15] <companion_cube> wow… yeah these are all giant
[21:24:37] <Brekkjern> They are quite a lot thinner, including the bezel around the screen
[21:25:07] <wrl> companion_cube: important to compare the actual phone dimensions rather than just the screen size these days
[21:25:07] <Brekkjern> So they might not feel much larger in your pocket
[21:25:10] <wrl> bezels went away
[21:25:11] <wrl> largely
[21:25:15] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[21:25:32] <companion_cube> bezel is the frame around the screen?
[21:25:35] <wrl> yep
[21:25:36] <Brekkjern> Yes
[21:25:57] <cb> yeah
[21:25:58] <Brekkjern> That said, I have an otterbox for my phone so mine is a bit bulkier
[21:26:01] <ben> 4a is a good size for me
[21:26:06] <ben> barely any bezels
[21:26:06] <cb> smaller bezel = you can get more screen footprint out of the area
[21:26:17] <companion_cube> right, right, makes sense
[21:26:33] <wrl> ben: i've been eyeing the 4a
[21:26:39] <wrl> i wish it was waterproof
[21:26:39] <ben> i've been happy with it
[21:26:45] <ben> great camera and it has a headphone jack
[21:26:46] <wrl> but otherwise it's got everything else i care about

[21:52:41] <dasm> Brekkjern: I'm in the same boat.. I had nexus 5x and I loved fingerprint unlock. Then, I finally decided to buy a new one (n 5x was out of security patches) so i went with pixel 4xl with face unlock... pixel 5 again has fingerprint unlock, and I'm stuck with "mask on - no unlock" or "oh, you briefly looked at me when you were putting me into your pocket, let me unlock for you now" phone.
[21:53:07] <dasm> The only good thing is "hey, i have recent security patches applied".
[21:54:46] <gwozniak> I'm content with old-ish iPhone and try not to use it very much
[21:55:22] <dasm> i tried to not overuse my phone until i started doing on-calls.. now, pagerduty reminds me every few, where my phone is...
[21:57:03] <gwozniak> I guess I mean I try not to do many tasks with it.  I basically only use mine for texting, phone calls, and 2FA
[21:57:34] <gwozniak> Oh, and taking pictures
[21:57:51] <companion_cube> I used to do that too, but now I use waze, whatsapp, a small bunch of apps, IRC, …
[21:57:56] <Brekkjern> dasm: Doesn't the 4xl have fingerprint unlock? Is it not just a few settings or something to decide what you want enabled?
[21:57:59] <companion_cube> being on vacation also made me use my phone a lot more
[21:58:01] <gwozniak> I do no social media stuff from it, though, and basically avoid web anything with it
[21:58:09] <dasm> i use mine for checking miniflux. recently i started doing twitter... which is kinda bad
[21:58:20] <gwozniak> Yeah
[21:58:58] <dasm> Brekkjern: no. it doesn't. they went against that. the only way to unlock your phone is via code or with your face...
[21:59:08] <Brekkjern> Lame
[21:59:13] <dasm> face detection is bad.
[21:59:19] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[21:59:27] <dasm> as i wrote: i
[21:59:46] <dasm> i'm taking my phone out in my car. when getting out of a car, i'm putting it into my pocket...
[21:59:56] <dasm> sometimes, i just skim over it, and it happily unlocks
[22:00:15] <dasm> i had this case several times, when i felt like i had some hot potato inside my pants.
[22:00:35] <Brekkjern> Hehe
[22:00:52] <dasm> other times, you can stare at a phone and it is like: "i don;t know who you are... why are you looking at me?"
[22:01:11] <gwozniak> Must have been the hot potato in your pants
[22:01:18] <dasm> :D
[22:01:27] <Brekkjern> As of now I have no desire to upgrade my phone. I bought it some time between 2019 and 2020, and it's performing great and the battery life is amazing
[22:01:52] <cb> i dont use face or finger unlock
[22:01:53] <Brekkjern> I also pretty much only use it for Reddit on my commute :P
[22:02:02] <Brekkjern> I have fingerprint unlock. I like that.
[22:02:09] <gwozniak> cb: my phone doesn't even support it
[22:02:16] <dasm> i would stay with nexus 5x if it wouldn't be about security patches.
[22:02:48] <gwozniak> Brekkjern: I got my phone about 2 years ago and I would like it to last at least another 5 years
[22:03:09] <dasm> it is convenient. i often used finger unlock. it was perfectly aligned on a back of the phone. so, by just pulling a phone out of pocket, i could have it unlocked immediately
[22:03:12] <Brekkjern> Yeah, I only switched because the screen broke on my previous one
[22:03:45] <dasm> gwozniak: why? you should have iphone4, iphone4s, iphone4x, iphone4xl.... and others...
[22:03:52] <dasm> every 2 months
[22:04:26] <cb> tbh part of why i bought an iphone is they get at least 5 years updates
[22:04:34] <cb> i plan to not buy another phone for a loooong while
[22:04:37] <cb> maybe put batteries into it
[22:05:06] <cb> most android phones are basically factory ewaste
[22:05:07] <dasm> after being hardcore against Apple, few months ago i started considering iphone...
[22:05:21] <dasm> because of exactly that cb
[22:06:09] <gwozniak> That's the main reason I did the iPhone.  I'm fairly certain it will last 5+ years
[22:07:55] <gwozniak> I have come to seriously despise throwaway electronics
[22:08:40] <gwozniak> I have a TV that is now 11 years old and I hope I can keep using it for many more years
[22:09:15] <gwozniak> Since it has basically no software on it, I'm reasonably confident it will last
[22:13:53] <cb> apple stuff is a lot less throwaway than the peanut gallery makes it
[22:14:56] <gwozniak> I used my first MBPro for about 6 years and as a hand-me-down it lasted for another 3 years
[22:15:16] <cb> i have a 2013 air with a 75% remainin gbattery
[22:15:25] <gwozniak> The Surface Book I bought 6 years ago is barely hanging on
[22:15:29] <cb> my thinkpad of the same era fell apart
[22:15:43] <cb> it's technically repairable but it's not worth if it all it does it destroy another battery in 2 years
[22:15:58] <cb> or the plastics still break
[22:16:09] <cb> using a macbook after years of thinkpads was like having a veil lifted on me
[22:16:10] <gwozniak> Scratch that. The MBPro can probably still work, once I get Teams off it, but the battery is totally dead
[22:16:30] <cb> if you replace the battery you'll prob get another decade out of it
[22:19:13] <gwozniak> We already replaced it once
[22:19:53] <gwozniak> All this reminds me that I need to take a look at it, since my wife prefers it to the Surface Book
[22:45:15] <gerikson> Apple hardware has good 2nd hand value
[22:48:45] <cb> yeah
[22:48:51] <cb> it took me a while to even get that air
[22:48:58] <cb> because usually mac used prices are almost as much as new
[22:49:08] <cb> thankfully M1 will help crater used mac prices
[22:49:21] <cb> that or you can just buy a new M1
[22:49:30] <cb> it's unreal how much SoC apple packed in there
[22:58:50] <goodger[m]> our R-number is down to 0.69, nice
