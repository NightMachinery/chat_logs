[00:38:25] <f-a> you might already have noticed it EvanR 
[00:38:30] <f-a> but that ide sm linked
[00:38:34] <f-a> has an sdl dependency
[00:38:43] <f-a> so idk maybe you can take inspiration and/or lift some code
[00:39:04] <EvanR> I'm very inspired without looking at its code
[00:39:23] <EvanR> but yeah I guess I should always look at more haskell code
[00:39:44] <EvanR> I'm only using SDL for audio right now
[00:40:18] <f-a> being very inspired writing SDL stuff is commending :P
[00:40:26] <f-a> or any graphical crap
[00:40:35] <f-a> I end up wasting time and not making a game
[00:41:03] <EvanR> yes... I made sure to sort that external crap away so I can waste time on the functional bits and not make a game
[00:43:02] <f-a> they call it ‚Äúnophoto syndrome‚Äù in photography forums
[00:43:12] <f-a> photography forums are even more bitter then programming forums
[00:43:42] <EvanR> really, that's interesting
[00:45:14] <f-a> if you can press the button, you can call yourself a photographer. Digital made it supercheap to shoot, hence people burst shots and pick the best frame
[00:45:46] <f-a> this is part of the allure of the medium ‚Äî democratic and a direct relationship with reality ‚Äî but created resentment among some ‚Äúpros‚Äù
[00:46:06] <EvanR> so what's nophoto syndrome
[00:48:37] <f-a> when you discuss about photographic gear, photographic technique etc. endlessly on forums
[00:48:45] <f-a> and have very little photographic output
[00:48:49] <EvanR> oh ok
[00:48:57] <EvanR> that's totally happening
[00:49:15] <f-a> and sometimes that makes me think about me‚Ä¶
[00:49:38] <f-a> with the exception that refactoring/learning a new abstraction *may* help you in the long run
[00:49:55] <EvanR> if anything, in the next life
[00:54:12] <ManofLetters[m]> indie gamedev is a sinister plot to teach people hacking and then crush their souls in IT departments in corporations
[01:09:59] <EvanR> like that documentary "The IT Crowd"
[01:24:14] <EvanR> the photography thing is apt because there are a lot of cool visuals I want to make
[01:26:04] <f-a> good! tho again, visuals take time ;_;
[01:29:17] <EvanR> today's diversion https://paste.tomsmeding.com/pRFLX7Cw
[01:32:22] <f-a> what am I looking at
[01:32:40] <f-a> is this some to-be-arrowised code
[01:33:28] <EvanR> no, fuck arrows xD
[01:34:21] <f-a> so frp?
[01:35:00] <EvanR> ü§î is FRP dead or
[01:35:27] <f-a> What is Open and Shut? xD
[01:35:59] <EvanR> open is a thing you toss food into to make it shut
[01:36:14] <EvanR> it can only open again by giving it time
[01:36:21] <EvanR> like a gator!

[09:48:43] <EvanR> I heard about it less these days, conal is MIA xD
[09:49:18] <EvanR> it didn't even seem to take over javascript

[20:45:42] <sm> someone should make a list of compelling real world frp uses
[20:46:18] <f-a> ‚Ä¢ selling frp books
[20:46:24] <sm> end user apps in particular
[20:47:18] <f-a> someone should make a statue to end user apps developers all over the haskell communities
[20:47:28] <f-a> and one to you in gold
[21:09:46] <ManofLetters[m]> why would we end all Haskell apps developers and using a walking statue, to boot?
[21:12:33] <f-a> that would do too
[21:12:49] <sm> indeed it seems a bit harsh f-a 
[21:13:03] <f-a> I am raging at ‚ÄúI have done an abstraction‚Äù +100000000¬π‚Å∞‚Å∞‚Å∞ reddit posts sm 
[21:13:39] <f-a> maybe I need a htherapist
[21:13:57] <sm> oh I need htherapist
[21:14:02] <sm> somebody please build one
[21:14:11] <f-a> ELIZA shouldn‚Äôt be difficult to port
[21:15:13] <sm> it should have domain knowledge: haskell build tools, libraries, type theory
[21:16:24] <sm> it could answer all the questions on #haskell

[22:24:05] <ManofLetters[m]> that's a therapy after which you need a therapy
