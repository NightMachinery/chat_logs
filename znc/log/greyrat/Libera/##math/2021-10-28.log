[00:56:36] <isekaijin> What I would do is set g_n = max { f_0, f_1, f_2, ..., f_n } and then use the monotone convergence theorem.

[00:58:48] <sedeki> cherim yeah. well i'm stuck at this part of the proof in the book

[01:00:01] <sedeki> yes
[01:00:06] <isekaijin> Abbreviate f = sup_n f_n again. The left hand side says “those x such that f(x) <= c” and the right hand side says “those x such that f_0(x) <= c and f_1(x) <= c and f_2(x) <= c and...”.

[03:06:15] <johnkeats6> qergle, without qualification i'd bet good money that's false, because of the selection effect (generally the most talented ones will be given tenure)
[03:06:20] <qergle> i think johnkeats6 makes a common mistake of getting something entirely wrong.
[03:06:23] <greenbagels> What if a=0 and b=1
[03:06:52] <qergle> one might ask themself, aside from professorships, what other profession enjoys tenure? i can think of perhaps only one (the american federal judge).
[03:07:08] <qergle> meanwhile we have certainly a crisis in academia
[03:07:31] <greenbagels> There's no bijective increasing function for that (a,b)
[03:07:39] <johnkeats6> well academia has to be shielded from market pressure since what it produces is largely economically useless
[03:07:47] <qergle> so tghe right question is, how likely is it that a profession that is uniquely characterized by job security is also plagued by so many issues.
[03:08:00] <atom951> greenbagels hmm good point, then assume $a, b \in (0, 1)$
[03:08:11] <qergle> how likely is it that those two things are correlated.
[03:08:24] <qergle> maybe the intelligent conclusion here is that tenure is the problem not the solution.
[03:09:15] <greenbagels> johnkeats6: I agree, but I don't know if tenure is the solution
[03:10:01] <greenbagels> Especially since, in physics at least, the success of professors research tends to be rather erratic in time over their career
[03:10:14] <greenbagels> in terms of impact or whatever
[03:11:15] <qergle> if we were to give truth serum to professors at big-time universities and ask them if they felt teaching was merely a cost they had to bear in order to be able to conduct taxpayer funded research, what % would say yes?
[03:11:39] <johnkeats6> i'd guess 80 or so

[06:36:36] <int-e> So each x_i has fixed exponents, but for different x_i, at least one of the exponents (for some s_j) is supposed to be different
[06:36:55] <int-e> This could certainly be explained better.
[06:37:55] <int-e> newpy: to pick an example, if k = 2 and n = 1, then you could have x_0 = 1, x_1 = s_1, x_2 = s_2 and x_3 = s_1 s_2. That covers all possibilities of choosing exponents in {0,1} for s_1 and s_2.

[09:51:00] <rubiksdream> hi, anyone know why this is true? Let u be harmonic outside the unit disk, and in some small neighbourhood of an arc of the circle (z_1,z_2) , if du/dr = 0 on this arc, then the formula u(z) = u(1 / \bar{z}) gives an extension to the unit disk plus this arc
[09:51:48] <rubiksdream> of course, u(1 / \bar{z}) is harmonic in the unit disk, but why does the combination of u's definition on the open arc plus this formula for the unit disk, give harmonicity on the open arc?

[10:52:31] <isekaijin> Another possibility would be a Möbius transformation that sends the unit circle to the (projective) real line.
[10:52:33] <rubiksdream> but why can we do this for multiple arcs, and such that the extension to the interior minus origin is given by u(1/bar{z})?
[10:53:18] <isekaijin> You do it for one arc at a time.
[10:53:34] <rubiksdream> the problem is, I have that u is harmonic in the exterior of the unit disk, and on some open arcs (z_1,z_2),...,(z_{n-1},z_n),(z_{n},z_{n+1}) i know that du/dr = 0, then u has a extension to the interior of the disk minus the origin, and the extension inside the disk is u(1/bar{z})

[11:24:01] <rubiksdream> basically the strategy is, translate to a line, apply usual schwarz , show the reflection is such that when we precompose with the inverse of the biholomorphism so that we come back to the disk, the reflection becomes u(1/bar{z}), or do the opposite, start with u(1/bar{z}) and show it becomes the reflection it ought to, but i think they are equally hard
[11:24:08] <isekaijin> Then du/dr = 0 translates to du/dy = 0.
[11:24:27] <rubiksdream> but you are still not constant on the line
[11:24:35] <rubiksdream> whether its du/dx = 0 or du/dy = 0 doesnt matter
[11:24:43] <rubiksdream> only the conjugate can be constant
[11:25:41] <isekaijin> Oh, dang, right. I see what you mean now.
[11:25:53] <isekaijin> I am so slow.
[11:26:01] <isekaijin> Well, if the conjugate works, then so be it.

[11:28:47] <rubiksdream> basically i want to be sure that if the conjugate has extension as v(1/barz) across the arc (i.e. it glues with v), then the same is true for u
[11:28:57] <rubiksdream> it feels like this should be true, but i need to pin down on the formal proof
[11:30:18] <rubiksdream> okay, i guess if we suppose it does, then v has a conjugate p s.t. p + iv is holomorphic in a disk centered at an arc point. but below the arc (in the interior) we know u(1/barz) + iv(1/barz) is holomorphic and the conjugate is determined up to a constant here..

[15:14:14] <greenbagels> it's not inconsistent at all
[15:14:16] <Juliu> Fine, only positive probabilities are called probabilities, I get it
[15:14:19] <greenbagels> we call them... negative numbers?
[15:14:37] <jmorris> Juliu: wrong again
[15:14:54] <Juliu> isekaijin, yes, and there is also a large corpus of theorems that hold for positive numbers
[15:14:59] <Vornicus> (note: "negative" was indeed supposed to be insulting to the negative numbers, like they're not really ... things.  For a long time you'd have four forms of quadratic formula just to avoid having negative numbers floating around)

[15:16:29] <isekaijin> Juliu: If you start using the name “probabilities” for things that are actually not probabilities, then the meaning of words starts getting diluted, and the applicability of theorems becomes more difficult to assess, because one then has to check whether what you mean by “probability” actually matches what was meant when the theorems were originally proved.
[15:16:35] <isekaijin> In short, it makes life difficult for no good reason.
[15:16:46] <jmorris> you guys are talking to someone who thinks probabilities must be positive
[15:16:49] <Vornicus> "negative probabilities" don't work like probabilities but the same is also true of "probabilities" greater than 1, which makes "negative" insufficient
[15:17:17] <Juliu> isekaijin, actually they are probabilities, only that mathematicians limit themselves to non-negative ones and don't call all other probabilites. I get it. Inconsistent, but ok

[15:21:51] <Juliu> jmorris, yes
[15:22:03] <Juliu> Random variables are random variables

[15:22:08] <jmorris> none of that narrow minded stuff
[15:22:28] <jmorris> you know
[15:22:33] <Juliu> jmorris, you can. Simple don't limit yourself to probabilities in [0, 1]
[15:22:34] <jmorris> negative probabilities as opposed to positive ones
[15:22:57] <jmorris> Juliu: i wish i had a mirror that was capable of showing you what im seeing
[15:23:00] <int-e> The need for quasiprobabilities is extremely small.
[15:23:13] <Juliu> Same as with this limited boolean algebra we talked about some days ago: Simply don't limit yourself to not only true and false. Actually, not that hard to understand
[15:23:34] <Juliu> jmorris, why would I want to see your mirror image?
[15:23:34] <jmorris> thanks
[15:23:57] <jmorris> ?
[15:24:04] <jmorris> oh nevermind
[15:24:17] <jmorris> its some low iq play
[15:24:22] <Juliu> int-e, they are quite common in quantum physics, which is the best theory we have to describe our reality ... unlike mathematicians who seem to prefer to limit themselves to unrealistic things
[15:24:46] <jmorris> Juliu: care to explain quantum physics to me
[15:25:14] <jmorris> and why is it the best theory we have to describe our reality?
[15:25:29] <Juliu> jmorris, why do you want me to explain everything just to make fun of it? Who's the immature/dumb one here?
[15:25:42] <jmorris> i really just dont know
[15:25:45] <jmorris> you sound like an expert
[15:25:49] <jmorris> its okay if you cant i understand
[15:25:50] <Juliu> Why is it the best theory? Because we don't have a better. What a question
[15:25:53] <Vornicus> The difficulty is that calling quasiprobabilities just probabilities *breaks probability* - it is the restrictions that make a lot of things useful.  You strip out the restrictions and you'll discover that a lot of the nice tractible-to-humans tools can't get used any more
[15:26:07] <jmorris> Juliu: mirror. now.
[15:26:20] <Juliu> Vornicus, it breaks nothing but the definition of the word, which I get
[15:26:48] <jmorris> Juliu: im guessing you havent watched a 10 minute youtube video about general relativity yet
[15:27:15] <Juliu> jmorris, you guess a lot, but it seems the probability of you guessing correctly is negative as well
[15:27:39] <Juliu> I.e. the less you guess, the more right you are
[15:27:49] <jmorris> the more you talk, the funnier this is
[15:28:00] <jmorris> its like everything you say is comedy gold
[15:28:11] <Juliu> It's just funny for you because you are too used to limiting your thoughts

[15:28:20] <int-e> jmorris: it's sad and painful
[15:29:13] <Juliu> Like I had to explain for like an hour 2 days ago why just true and false for boolean values is simply not complete
[15:29:55] <Juliu> People are simply not used to new thoughts and find everything new they don't understannd immediately funny

[17:08:31] <rubiksdream> isekaijin btw in case youre interested, i resolved the problem we were discussing earlier ,so the idea is take some mobius map (e.g. cayley transform) M : H -> D, then locally at some point of an arc z \in (z_j,z_{j+1}), u+iv = f is holomorphic (v is the conjugate), du/dr = 0 means v is constant on the arc, transport this to upper half plane, so we have f o M has constant imaginary part c on some open interval, so we can reflect
[17:08:31] <[itchyjunk]> x = pi/2 + 2pin or 5pi/2 + 2 pi n :s
[17:08:31] <rubiksdream> (foM)-c , getting bar{foM{bar{z}}} - c, so the extension of foM is bar{foM{bar{z}}}, then bar o f o M o bar o M^{-1} is the extension of f to the interior of the disk, and M o bar o M^{-1} = 1 / bar{z}, so the extension is bar o f (1 / bar{z}), this guys real part is surprise surprise, u(1 / bar{z}), which means u (1/bar{z}) does glue with the u defined in the small neighbourhood of the arc
[17:09:34] <[itchyjunk]> z = x + iy would give me z = pi/3 + 2 pi n + i 2 pi k or z = 5 pi /3  + 2 pi n + i 2 pi k no?

[18:51:28] <thyriaen> Hiho - i am wondering if i can expand <A*v, z> somehow, where A is a matrix mxn and v is a vector of dimension m and z being of dimension n
[18:52:14] <Z-module> Isn't v a column vector with n entries?
[18:52:36] <thyriaen> yes it is
[18:53:04] <thyriaen> sorry, i mistyped my question there :p
[18:53:56] <Z-module> so Av is an m-vector ... isn't z also an m-vector?
[18:54:02] <thyriaen> z is also a vector with m vector
[18:54:14] <thyriaen> that what i was saying - i switched them up

[18:56:50] <Z-module> So you want to expand that into some sum that only involves parts of A at a time?
[18:59:45] <thyriaen> well my goal would be to somehow change it to < something, v>
[19:00:26] <thyriaen> i am not really sure what can be done with a matrix in terms of the inner product so anything would basically be helpful :p
[19:01:11] <qergle> if A is a symmetric operator then <Av,z>=<Az,v> no?
[19:02:16] <rubiksdream> yeah, because his thing is <A^t z,v> = <Av,z>
[19:02:22] <qergle> or more accurately, <Av,z>=<v,Az>
[19:02:49] <rubiksdream> heh, why is that more or less accurate
[19:03:04] <int-e> it's one less transpose
[19:03:11] <rubiksdream> ah ok
[19:03:17] <thyriaen> does that work for any matrix A ?
[19:03:54] <rubiksdream> <A^t z , v> = <Av,z> does
[19:04:03] <rubiksdream> the other requires A = A^t in general
[19:04:55] <thyriaen> so in essence <Av,z> = <A^T z , v>
[19:05:14] <rubiksdream> thyriaen fyi , for column vectors a,b, <a,b> is given by a^t b
[19:05:28] <thyriaen> rubiksdream, yes that i do understand
[19:05:28] <rubiksdream> so you can play around with inner products using that and basic transpose identities
[19:05:53] <thyriaen> <Av,z> = <A^T z , v> this is not obvious to me why that holds
[19:06:18] <int-e> just use <u,v> = u^T v
[19:06:23] <rubiksdream> just from writing (Av)^t z
[19:06:36] <rubiksdream> and (Av)^t = v^t A^t
[19:06:38] <int-e> and then simplify using the (AB)^T = B^T A^T law.
