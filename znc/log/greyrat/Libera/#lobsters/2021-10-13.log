[00:52:25] <ngoldbaum> he said things were in the game that like flat out weren’t and wouldn’t be added until years after release

[01:00:23] <imode> ngoldbaum: straight up lying.
[01:01:03] <ngoldbaum> props to them for actually improving no man’s sky and making a good game in the end
[01:01:10] <imode> anybody defending that performance could probably be tricked into buying bitconnect at some point. I used to be in the "he didn't know how he came across" camp but there's no ambiguities in that performance.
[01:01:27] <ngoldbaum> i’m sure the contract they had with sony was a pain and made them work under impossible time pressure

[01:17:48] <imode> ignaloidas: where exactly does this explain how things happened? I'm 11 minutes in.
[01:17:52] <ngoldbaum> i want to see more games use the dialog and character systems in disco elysium, it makes it much easier to construct narrative heavy rpgs than other systems
[01:19:03] <ignaloidas> imode, "what actually happened" is deadlines are hard
[01:19:08] <imode> he's talked wonderful about passion, community engagement, shutting out "toxic people" and filtering noise... but he _lied_ to people blatantly, covered it up after the fact, and then everybody forgot about 'em for a while afer they went dark, and now the game is "complete" but just as boring as it was on day 1.
[01:19:17] <imode> there was nothing there about deadlines.
[01:19:28] <imode> unless it's in the last few minutes.
[01:20:07] <imode> like I don't see the apology, I don't see the justification, I don't see the "I was working on what we had planned, but it just fell through".

[01:20:33] <imode> I see a lot of masturbation on stage but very little actual content.
[01:21:07] <ignaloidas> the talk is not "postmortem of no mans sky" it's on how to deal with bullshit when you fail your launch
[01:21:22] <imode> _he lied_. that's not failing a launch, nobody knows _why they lied in the first place_.
[01:21:40] <ngoldbaum> there’s hype and then there’s misrepresentation, there was no universe where the game would have multiplayer for a long time after launch, for example
[01:22:24] <ignaloidas> imode, he is bad at communicating and didn't know what not to say
[01:22:30] <ignaloidas> simple as that
[01:22:43] <imode> I'm bad at communicating and I've never outright lied about multiple features to the depth that he did.
[01:23:34] <ignaloidas> if you were to talk about your, let's say OS project to the press, I do fully expect that you would say things that are not built yet but you are planning on
[01:23:48] <ignaloidas> it's the same with him
[01:24:12] <imode> okay, and if I had a release I'd be transparent about what's going in, what's not going in, what's finished, what patches will be present.
[01:24:21] <imode> I don't play a game of chicken with a bunch of angry customers.
[01:24:40] <imode> that's bullshit. this isn't a way you do business or a way you communicate with people.
[01:24:51] <ignaloidas> he did back off a lot of those claims closer to launch, but people didn't listen to those at that point

[01:25:19] <imode> sony backed this. they had a PR department.
[01:25:21] <ignaloidas> s video on it
[01:25:26] <imode> yeah I watched that video, and there's quite a bit wrong/made up.
[01:25:34] <ignaloidas> such as?

[01:26:48] <imode> everyone wants to turn a scorned individual into a hero when they make a remote amount of progress, that's some sort of cultural reflex we have.
[01:27:01] <imode> but he straight up lied.
[01:27:13] <ignaloidas> there's no QA on it that I see
[01:27:16] <imode> and then covered it up. and then went dark. and then they started adding things people were complaining about it.
[01:27:24] <imode> ah, must've been taken down. which is unfortunate.
[01:27:36] <drobilla> Just throwing it out there but if anyone wants to pay me millions of dollars to lie about video games I am very interested in that opportunity :)
[01:27:58] <imode> also, _they had Sony's backing_. they _have a PR department_ and it was in full swing during the hype train.

[01:28:16] <imode> it's very unlikely to assume this couldn't have been conveyed _through that department_.
[01:28:17] <ngoldbaum> oh yeah sony was totally in on it
[01:28:23] <ngoldbaum> that trailer
[01:29:00] <ignaloidas> note that sony backed it with not a lot time to launch, and that still most of the claims were done by murray, who is not good with cameras
[01:29:09] <ignaloidas> pressure to promise is high
[01:29:14] <imode> annnnnnd that doesn't.. really matter.
[01:29:37] <imode> "backed it with not a lot of time to launch" wouldn't rule out a PR campaign.
[01:30:23] <ignaloidas> saying "this won't be in" isn't going to work when the hype train is rolling full steam ahead
[01:30:43] <imode> "this won't be in, but it's coming" _is a valid response if you don't want pissed off customers_.
[01:31:41] <ignaloidas> you don't get clicks on such articles, nobody will see that until it's too late
[01:32:03] <imode> again, it's a game of chicken between you and your customers. if you're barreling towards eachother and you have announced features that cause your customers to freak out and preorder because "IT LOOKS AWESOME!!!!", that's your fault, bail out, make the announcement, avoid disaster.
[01:32:09] <ignaloidas> he talks about the media in the talk I linked to, and the adversarial relationship with them
[01:32:42] <ignaloidas> stopping the hype train is as hard as starting it up
[01:32:47] <imode> where? I haven't heard a bit of that. I heard a bunch about toxic commentary and the difference between engaged people (i.e people who were hooked on his lies) vs. people that weren't swayed.
[01:33:02] <ignaloidas> imode, I think around 13 minute mark
[01:33:07] <imode> I'm at 15 minutes in.
[01:33:27] <ignaloidas> you must have missed it then
[01:33:38] <imode> I assure you I've been paying full attention.
[01:33:54] <imode> defense of conmen usually accompanies some form of stockholm syndrome.
[01:34:02] <ignaloidas> he talks about killing all media relations and talking with the people only through release notes

[15:13:38] <mockturtle> [ Database of Databases ] - dbdb.io
[15:13:55] <amirouche> from a numbers point of view sure most databases do not provide some kind ACID guarantees

[15:21:52] <amirouche> note on dbdb.io/stats, in the column embeds / uses: except leveldb (which has overestimated performance) and possibly kyoto cabinet they all have ACID transactions, and only 3 out of 10 are SQL

[15:24:53] <amirouche> the author of kyoto cabinet released recently tkrzw, they work at google, and did not reply to my request for feedback about whether to include bytes and key count in okvs (dbm successor)
[15:25:41] <amirouche> bytes count is part latest foundationdb release, which helps to prepare a large transaction and slice it into smaller chunks
[15:26:44] <amirouche> but to optimize query plans, even small queries, you need key count. The maintainer of mongodb's wiredtiger commented that it was design mistake not to add bytes OR key count in wiredtiger

[15:33:04] <amirouche> given they already support non-monotonic counter to allocate quickly uids (not tested by me), I hope they add key AND bytes count, and also hopefully at least document how to work with bigger than ram data.
[15:33:46] <amirouche> I seems the norm that databases need to have as much RAM as the dataset, it counter-intuitive to me.
[15:34:12] <c355E3B> That's a thing I'm trying to fix at work right now.
[15:34:35] <c355E3B> My general take is that its easier to debug issues related to not enough ram than it is to deal with disk related things.

[17:03:07] <cb> C is low level, right
[17:06:19] * shapr thinks about that
[17:06:52] <cb> it's so easy for people to forget C has a runtime
[17:07:07] <cb> in unix it's de facto mandatory so people forget

[20:54:14] <shapr> the one thing I really hate about zoom is that it will magically unmute on mac sometimes
[20:54:22] <shapr> and we only use zoom for 300+ all hands calls at work
[20:54:50] <shapr> so sometimes I get the "you have been muted" message when I know I was muted at the start of the call, and I wasn't doing anything but watching the screen
[20:59:14] <technomancy> any microphone that doesn't have a hardware mute switch is defective
[21:03:07] <riv> it's crazy how we got cameras pointed as us 24/7

[21:04:11] <technomancy> at least cameras are easier to see and cover than microphones

[23:05:47] <af> how big does a server need to be
[23:06:42] <kline> mostly the issue is going to be your tiny vps provider deciding the network abuse our servers receive and the subsequent impact on your neighbours isnt worth keeping your $2/mo instance around for

[23:07:42] <shapr> I can see IRC user count going down, but EFNet and all those others were not fun when the ircwarriors were active
[23:10:03] <kline> af, our minimum requirements are 2 core, 4GB ram, 20GB disk, be able to burst network nicely (who doesnt have 1Gbit though) but importantly your provider needs to be able to swallow 100G floods and not decide your account is a net-loss and terminate your contract

[23:24:07] <technomancy> af: to be fair the author does repeatedly emphasize they are new to the topic and have no idea what they're talking about
[23:24:18] <af> technomancy: Oh I'm not complaining at all
[23:24:23] <af> I'm glad they wrote this

[23:26:34] <riv> scope is everything
[23:26:42] <af> well said

[23:42:11] <af> man that was actually a rollercoaster
[23:42:13] <af> nice

[23:43:04] <af> I think I've been through similar right-wrong-right-wrong phases with several concepts in software development language agnostically
[23:43:32] <af> (un)fortunately I'm too lazy to write such blogposts
[23:44:22] <technomancy> it's all over the place but I enjoyed it
[23:45:25] <af> does anyone remember how css-in-js or html-in-js used to be a crime at one point?
[23:45:30] *** Joins: YellowSuB (~YellowSuB@user/yellowsub)
[23:45:37] <riv> we should go back to that being a crime
[23:46:11] <af> or how xorg's server/client isomorphy was seen as woefully pathetic
[23:47:44] <af> or how the ability to identify a protocol on the wire was considered like extremely important
[23:47:51] <technomancy> I guess the one weird thing about the macro story is that it opens with "I thought macros were dumb because I misunderstood them" and then it's like "I misunderstood them because I thought macros were functions of AST->AST but I was wrong"
[23:48:00] <martian67|> if programmers knew what was right and wrong when it comes to trendy ideas, it wouldn't keep changing every year

[23:48:25] <technomancy> so ... does that mean non-janet macros are dumb?
[23:48:29] <martian67|> its more like fashion than actual engineering
[23:48:45] <af> martian67|: fashion, indeed. excellent choice of terminology.

[23:49:16] *** Quits: mrmanner (~jmanner@user/mrmanner) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[23:50:47] <technomancy> also I love how the janet syntax highlighting is like "hey this looks like a lisp, so semicolons must be comments, right? right?" >_<

[23:50:59] <af> I feel like process management has had relatively fewer trends than it deserves. systemd is like the one thing, what else.
[23:51:18] <technomancy> what's the djb one again?
[23:51:22] <af> for the most part everything non-systemd is just sysvinit but implemented better
[23:51:24] <af> yea daemon tools
[23:51:42] *** Joins: dsrt^ (~dsrt@wsip-70-165-23-55.mc.at.cox.net)
[23:51:44] <af> I don't think it's that different from sysvinit if you do sysvinit right
[23:53:05] <af> I have a script which automates running daemons in foreground mode inside a tmux session and sets up panes nicely
[23:53:14] <af> I think it's a real contender
[23:53:26] <af> best debugging and monitoring experience ever
[23:53:58] <af> well, for cheap, at least
[23:53:58] <technomancy> sounds pretty compelling tbh
[23:54:02] <af> ikr
[23:54:10] <af> I'm actually not kidding
[23:54:47] <af> except that I've parroted the "node always runs inside tmux" joke like a gazillion times
[23:56:06] <companion_cube> fool
[23:56:10] <companion_cube> node runs in docker, in tmux
[23:56:32] <af> lol fair enough
[23:56:43] *** Quits: rtjure (~rtjure@vlan-209-171-157.comnet.bg) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:56:43] <af> tbh the joke was probably conceived in a pre-docker era
[23:57:29] <af> gosh to think that node's popularity predates docker's popularity
[23:57:46] <af> okay I'll stop rambling now
[23:58:04] <dsc_> is node even used nowadays?
[23:58:11] <technomancy> haha
[23:58:44] <dimadima> node probably runs this IRC network
[23:59:01] * dimadima waits for permaban
[23:59:21] <technomancy> vile lies
[23:59:27] <af> if it did, kline probably wouldn't be able to claim that a dual core machine is capable of handling such traffic
[23:59:30] <dsc_> i reject your hypothesis
[23:59:43] <dimadima> af: but it's async
[23:59:48] <kline> hm?
