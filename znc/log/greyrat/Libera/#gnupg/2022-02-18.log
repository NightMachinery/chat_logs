[11:28:36] <labrador> oh
[11:29:15] <euouae> henk, I'm not the best with file management, is it possible to just upload it on my github profile e.g.? any downsides?
[11:29:19] <labrador> ye the same question....What do you mean by maintainence?
[11:29:48] <aa_> you can use keybase
[11:30:12] <labrador> wait isn't keybase a chat app?
[11:30:38] <aa_> also, but the idea is almost the same as the web of trust
[11:31:47] <labrador> euouae, could you define more explicitly what you want to maintain? Cuz its pretty easy to trim excess keys,and remove extra uids and subkeys
[11:32:39] <henk> euouae: what file management? where? who what? o_O
[11:33:19] <euouae> well if I wipe my hd for example
[11:33:30] <euouae> which I do every now and then as I get into more complicated OSes and setups
[11:33:47] <euouae> it would be nice to not have to re-trust keys
[11:33:57] <labrador> save your pubring.kbx the
[11:33:58] <labrador> n
[11:34:15] <euouae> that's what I'm saying, is syncing that with the cloud fine? 
[11:34:21] <labrador> Contary to its name it stores your privkeys too
[11:34:40] <euouae> I think mine only has stubs
[11:34:41] <labrador> euouae, well probably not....encrypt before you upload
[11:35:09] <labrador> Even tho the privkey is encrypted. The metadata leak alone would be disastrous
[11:36:16] <duxsco> euouae: just got online, what do you want to upload to github?
[11:36:47] <euouae> duxsco I'm just asking how people maintain their public keyring
[11:37:28] <euouae> if I'm on the go I sometimes don't have access to my personal stuff, so it would make sense to be able to import my trusted list of keys
[11:37:32] <euouae> from online
[11:37:33] <duxsco> i store mine on dane, wkd and my own keyserver. wkd and keyserver run on nginx
[11:37:34] <labrador> euouae, we don't really. Or atleast I don't take backups of my public keyring. It can be downloaded from the keyservers at will.
[11:37:56] <duxsco> ah, keyring. just locally and backup
[11:37:56] <euouae> labrador your public keyring can be downloaded from the keyservers?
[11:38:11] <labrador> euouae, yeh most of it anyway
[11:38:13] <henk> wait, what? secret keys are in pubring.kbx? labrador: do you have a reference for that?
[11:38:56] *** Joins: drathir_tor (~drathir@wireguard/tunneler/drathir)
[11:38:57] <labrador> henk, I read somewhere that both functions were merged into pubring.kbx one day on se
[11:39:05] <labrador> sometime*
[11:39:31] <euouae> on second thought, that doesn't make sense henk, does it? there's pubring.kbx and private-keys-v1.d under my .gnupg
[11:40:20] <henk> huh, would be the first time I hear about it but I donâ€™t have a source/reference for believing private keys are actually _not_ in there but somewhere else either o_O
[11:40:23] <labrador> https://github.com/riseupnet/riseup_help/pull/456/commits/af2b7d86b1dfcceae8697128a26f9ecddbe0e324
[11:40:24] <labrador> THis
[11:40:35] <labrador> Note: @hopenpgp-tools@ currently does not work with GnuPG version 2.1 and up. This is because GnuPG version 2.1 and up store both your public and private key in @~/.gnupg/pubring.kbx@. @hkt@ expects to find your public key in @~/.gnupg/pubring.gpg@ and will give an error message if you are using GnuPG version 2.1 and up.
[11:40:54] <labrador> I think it works okay as a source?
[11:41:02] <duxsco> euouae: you could just do a "gpg --export --armor > pubkeys.asc" and "gpg --export-ownertrust > ownertrust.txt"
[11:41:42] <duxsco> and take a look at "--export-options"
[11:41:44] <duxsco> in manpage
[11:42:01] <euouae> labrador that commit is a mistake, as it says
[11:42:18] <labrador> https://gnupg.org/faq/whats-new-in-2.1.html
[11:42:19] <duxsco> like "--export-options backup"
[11:42:27] <euouae> if you read it, the - line is the wrong claim, and the + line is corrected; the title says "gpg doesn't store keys in pubring.kbx"
[11:42:53] <labrador> hmm
[11:43:55] <euouae> labrador and, ok let's assume that's where the priv keys are, then at least they are encrypted 
[11:44:06] <labrador> ok yeah I seemed to have missed that...
[11:44:33] <henk> Â»To ease the migration to the no-secring method, gpg detects the presence of a secring.gpg and converts the keys on-the-fly to the the key store of gpg-agent (this is the private-keys-v1.d directory below the GnuPG home directory (~/.gnupg)).Â«
[11:44:55] <labrador> ye henk its stored in that directory in a special format
[11:45:16] <euouae> The whole story was that gpg no longer knows about privkeys, and it's delegated to gpg-agent
[11:45:32] <labrador> yeah
[11:46:05] <euouae> you can criticize gnupg for a lot of things but naming a file 'pubring' and putting secrets in it, wow :D
[11:46:14] <euouae> that's /not/ something anyone sane would do 
[11:47:09] <euouae> duxsco, thank you, I am going to look into that
[11:48:09] <duxsco> euouae: perhaps, i misinterpreted "maintain" while still thinking of public keys... did you mean backing up the keyring?
[11:48:43] <euouae> duxsco my idea is that I have a hardware key that I carry around that has my ESA keys in it
[11:49:12] <euouae> duxsco but I sometimes use computers that are not mine, so I want to be able to still verify the things I download
[11:50:10] <euouae> e.g. if I download an .iso from gentoo, I'd like to check for integrity and authenticity

[11:54:04] <duxsco> the bare minimum would be storing the output of "gpg --export-ownertrust" on, for example, github. in there you have the long key ids as well as ownertrust info
[11:54:29] <duxsco> and, do something like "curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -fsSL https://github.../ownertrust.txt | grep -v "^#" | cut -d':' -f1 | paste -d ' ' -s - | xargs gpg --recv-keys"
[11:54:54] <duxsco> --tlsv1.3 for github, because they support it ;)
[11:55:17] <duxsco> thereafter, a "gpg --import-ownertrust" on the .txt
[11:55:23] <labrador> wait a minute does curl by default not use tls?
[11:56:16] <euouae> duxsco is just forcing it, labrador 
[11:56:28] <labrador> oh
[11:56:29] <euouae> there's a negotiation between server/client for what to use
[11:56:52] <duxsco> if you access https://, yes. but, you could be forwarded to http:// with "-L" set. that shouldn't be the case for github, but i use it set for every curl by default
[11:57:21] <duxsco> s/i use it set/i set it/'
[11:58:03] <duxsco> just like i enforce https only via firefox settings
[11:58:36] <duxsco> https-only
[11:59:02] <labrador> so basically if you're curling a https:// link it cannot be downgraded to http but can be downgraded to tls 1.1 or something
[11:59:15] <labrador> --tlsv1.3 prevents that
[11:59:18] <labrador> right?

[11:59:41] <euouae> I think tls 1.1 is broken so it won't be downgraded to that

[12:00:03] <duxsco> but, may break the download on other pages

[12:03:01] <duxsco> i just know that tls <1.2 is widely deprecated
[12:03:26] <euouae> yeah but it's possible that curl accepts tls1.1
[12:03:30] <euouae> I just don't think it would accept 1.0
[12:03:47] <duxsco> for --ciphers i use "openssl ciphers -s -v | grep -i aead | grep -i dhe", sorted to my liking

[12:04:45] <euouae> thansk again for the info. I will read more on --export-onwretrust
[12:04:58] <duxsco> in curl, they even have --sslv2, but they ignore that as well as --sslv3
