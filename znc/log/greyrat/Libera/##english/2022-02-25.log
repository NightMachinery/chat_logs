[00:01:18] <AmalLight> GuiToris i will find you i think
[00:01:35] <GuiToris> :/ it doesn't really fit in the lyrics
[00:01:51] <GuiToris> So I'll seek you out  Just to find myself   And I'll worry 'bout consequences later
[00:02:36] <AmalLight> seek is not common verb, strange
[00:03:48] <AmalLight> it's like i will take care of you and i will put you out and I'll worry about consequences
[00:04:02] <AmalLight> is it a song for teenagers ?
[00:04:39] <GuiToris> eh, do you think there's a separate genre for teenagers?
[00:05:03] <AmalLight> yes XD
[00:05:03] <GuiToris> Even Sum41 and Blink182 are listened to by adults
[00:05:32] <AmalLight> it sounds like a old man say that to a younger girl, but i don't know

[00:23:05] <AmalLight> GuiToris Britney or Madonna?
[00:23:13] <GuiToris> Britney
[00:23:27] <GuiToris> I think Hit Me Baby One More Time was the most popular song at that time
[00:23:48] <AmalLight> yes i can remember this hit

[05:13:33] <Alagolafre> Anyone here into Middle English?
[05:15:58] <szm> Not me
[05:19:09] <Alagolafre> Do you.... want to get into Middle English?
[05:19:42] <Alagolafre> Also, any idea how to convert cups to jiggers? I lost my little measuring buddy. >_<
[05:22:14] <szm> Why not
[05:27:29] <Alagolafre> (Must have done something wrong, because this gin and tonic mostly tastes like gin. Anyway...) I was trying to read a translation of a Carolingian romance.
[05:27:31] <Alagolafre> Not going well.
[05:27:50] <Alagolafre> I should probably wait to get through the Middle English books I have on paper before I try reading digital ones as well.
[05:28:22] <szm> Yeah seems like a good idea
[05:29:00] <Alagolafre> Do you reckon "Certyfyinge" means "Certifying"? 
[05:31:04] <szm> There's a resemblance but don't know enoigh to be sure
[05:32:09] <Alagolafre> "Nwe telle we of the messange(r), That wente to Charlemayne, Certyfyinge him by lettres dere, Howe the Romaynes were slayne, And howe the Contrey brente was Vnto the Gate of Rome, And howe the people song ‘alas,’ Tille socoure from him come."
[05:32:24] <Alagolafre> The (r) is a sort of unique character.
[05:34:28] <Alagolafre> I mean, the rhymes are nice.
[05:34:39] <Alagolafre> It has a sort of swing to it, I suppose.
[05:35:06] <Alagolafre> "Socoure" though... I have no idea, frankly.
[05:36:26] <Alagolafre> Ah! That one, unline "Certyfyinge" is in the Middle English Dictionary online.
[05:36:58] <szm> Ooooh
[05:37:20] <Alagolafre> "Aid, assistance, help; support, encouragement; also, spiritual aid, spiritual comfort," as well as, "Military assistance provided by an individual or an armed host," or, "Protection, refuge; defense," which is probably the sense in which it is used here.
[05:37:49] <Alagolafre> Ah, this was a fun little side bar, but I really should just take a course on Middle English and stick to reading the modern stuff for now.

[05:52:38] <Alagolafre> Ah, Siddhartha Mukherjee is a rather poetic pop science writer, but a very different area.
[05:52:45] <Alagolafre> Also, hey, Yali.
[05:52:51] <Alagolafre> Nice covert username, dork.
[05:52:59] <szm> Lol
[05:53:01] <yali> ;-;-;-;-;
[05:53:58] <Alagolafre> We are talking writing and reading.
[05:54:18] <Alagolafre> In English, I suppose, to keep it channel relevant.
[05:54:49] <yali> ofc
[05:55:00] <Alagolafre> Anything you are up to?
[05:55:05] <Alagolafre> In that department, I mean.
[05:55:29] <yali> in the english department? lol
[05:55:39] <Alagolafre> Yes, in the Department of English.
[05:55:48] <Alagolafre> The Department of the Translation of the Classics.
[05:56:01] <yali> 🧐️
[05:56:10] <Alagolafre> The Department of the Silly Lingua Franca of Far Too Much of the World.
[05:56:48] <Alagolafre> Well, I can't say 'The Department of the Classics' without 'Translation' in there. It would end up with me missing most of the classics.
[05:57:33] <Alagolafre> Imagine studying classicism without sacrificing at least two babies to the memory of Homer.
[05:57:58] <yali> hahahah
[05:58:13] <szm> I can't read :/
[05:58:17] <Alagolafre> Wait, fr?
[05:58:26] <Alagolafre> I mean, 'Wait, in sooth?'
[05:58:33] <Alagolafre> Because we are in the English channel.
[05:58:56] <yali> yeah idk what that word means
[05:59:00] <Alagolafre> Yes, I did begin a sentence with a conjunction; it was stylistic. 
[05:59:08] <Alagolafre> Sooth means truth, essentially.

[06:02:14] <Alagolafre> Do you think that the person with the Nick-Name "Aryan" here actually meant to type "Arian" because they thought that Christ was not eternal and part of god?
[06:03:04] <Alagolafre> *Should have put a 'not' after the conjunction as well. No one take advice on clear writing from me.
[06:03:25] <Alagolafre> Well, not 'not' part of god. I don't know; it's complicated.

[13:56:44] <skyfall> Yeah, I'll note the "a" part. But what about the apostrophe?

[13:57:40] <kurahaupo> So your impression was correct
