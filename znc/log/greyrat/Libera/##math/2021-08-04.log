[00:01:35] <Vornicus> So I'm going through a math course - discrete differential geometry, with keenan crane https://brickisland.net/DDGSpring2021/ .  And this is the first time I've actually done a math class in a long time - something like a decade.  And it keeps happening that he hits upon a topic that I've only barely touched, or seen and gone "shit I need to know a lot more math to understand this", or knew about but felt it
[00:01:35] <Vornicus> was cheaty, and it turns out that it was only just barely out of reach and I just needed a little structure to get there, and it is brain-exploding every time

[01:20:57] <Vornicus> the cheaty thing: so - you've got the cross product, which is, in its normal formulation, exclusive to 3d.
[01:23:50] <Fangs> sure
[01:24:15] <Vornicus> But you can use it in 2d too: pretend that your two vectors have 0 as their z component, cross as normal, and then extract the z component as a scalar.

[01:27:06] <greenbagels> are you asking about the distinction between k-vectors and k-forms in general or just in the special case of k=0
[01:27:30] <Vornicus> and the other generalization, where you take a d-1  1-vectors in d dimensional space and wedge them all together and then hodge star that, and you get a 1-vector perpendicular to all the inputs

[01:33:58] <Fangs> Vornicus: if you take a vector space, then "du ^ dv" these are k-vectors, k-forms are usually taken with a smooth function as coefficient, and instead of a wedge of k vectors, they are a wedge of k dualvectors
[01:33:59] <Vornicus> this class - though it's *discrete* differential geometry, so it also focuses more on practical computational stuff - expects you to have some knowledge of vector calculus
[01:34:10] *** Quits: bosspotato (~bosspotat@user/bosspotato) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[01:35:11] <pikapika> What do you need to know beforehand before starting a differential geometry book?
[01:35:12] <Vornicus> right, the dual/covector thing I don't quite get yet.  But I'm patient and expect this to show up properly again soon, since the riemannian metric introduces how to work in curved space, so I expect that soon, the flat and sharp operators will be defined in terms of that.
[01:35:14] <Fangs> pikapika: that depends on what kind of differential geometry you want to learn. if you just want to learn the 'classical' curves and surfaces, multivariable calculus is about all you need
[01:35:26] <markasoftware> At my university I believe you are required to take calculus and real analysis before differential geometry
[01:35:30] <pikapika> Fangs, would I also need to know some so called "analysis"?
[01:35:55] <Fangs> wouldn't hurt
[01:35:56] <Vornicus> (I wasn't looking for help here on this I was mostly ranting)
[01:36:27] <Fangs> pikapika: try reading a book on curves and surfaves differential geometry, if you need analysis then you'll need it. otherwise you don't
[01:36:45] <markasoftware> I have not studied differential geometry but I think it would be important to understand formal definitions of limit, continuity, convergence, etx
[01:36:54] <mh_le> Fangs: who wrote it?
[01:37:07] <Fangs> I hadnt suggested any book in mind
[01:37:21] <Vornicus> anyway - then there's the riemannian metric itself.  These words always scared me off - they looked considerably more advanced than I would normally be able to handle.  And now it's been introduced and I understand what it's aiming at and *dang*
[01:37:26] <Fangs> Vornicus: a dual vector is something that takes a vector and produces a scalar. if you INSISTS that column vectors are vectors, then row vectors are your covectors
[01:37:58] <greenbagels> markasoftware: differential geometry is the study of spaces-that-aren't-always-R^n-where-you-can-do-calculus so yes, i think that sounds reasonable

[01:51:25] <Fangs> Vornicus: here's why it makes sense to 'tack on' covectors when you differentiate a function. if you have a curve C(t), and you take the derivative at some point p, then C'(p) is a tangent vector at C(p).
[01:52:12] <Fangs> Vornicus: a function f on your space takes points in space, so it takes in C(p), but if you differentiate it, it takes in a tangent vector and spits out a scalar

[01:59:04] <Fangs> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplicial_complex just the pictures
[02:00:05] <Fangs> cherim: I'd believe you if you say we work over p-adic fields or something to that flavour, since at least we can have inequalities
[02:00:20] <Fangs> (but I wouldn't touch it with a 10 foot pole)
[02:01:40] <cherim> That's about the distance to keep from meshes as well
[02:01:42] <Vornicus> yep.  in this course we're mostly working with triangle meshes, but there's been one example of tetrahedral meshes in 3d space and one example of cubey things
[02:02:04] <Fangs> you might be primed to learn about algebraic topology then
[02:02:35] <Fangs> they'd talk about general topological spaces at first, but very quick will often introduce these 'simplicial complex' as a discrete model for topological spaces

[04:08:37] <Freemo[m]> Am I correct in asserting that when doing u substitution for integration you must make sure that after the u substitution that none of the original  variable you were integrating against should remain (the u and u' should replace all occurances)... right?
[04:08:56] <Freemo[m]> im having a brain fart and just need a sanity check :)
[04:10:31] <buster> hi Freemo[m]. there's no advantage in not doing so.

[04:15:39] <Freemo[m]> Vornicus: my improved form of the equation just simplified it using an integrating factor
[04:15:49] <Vornicus> Oh my
[04:16:10] <Freemo[m]> Vornicus: yea... was way simpler before i started diving into it
[04:16:26] <Freemo[m]> or i should say seemed way simpler
[04:17:24] <Freemo[m]> Vornicus: the good news is I have a lot of freedom in selecting my fundemental equations. I have been playing with trig forms as well as non-trig forms that have the right shapes... but trial and error hasnt gotten me too far

[04:18:39] <Vornicus> I was more expecting something in the realm of "here's a shot from my calc 2 textbook", to be honest, this is serious work.  My main point was to get your actual problem into the open so we might avoid XY difficulties, though, so here we are
[04:18:57] <johnkeats6> buster, quite short huh
[04:19:08] <johnkeats6> the notation seems a little less than modern
[04:19:52] <Freemo[m]> Vornicus: ohhh yea, lol I kinda miss actual calculus textbook problems. You always know there is some elegant simple solution with minimal terms... the real world you never really know if you can solve the damn thing at all until you do, and the equation might be 10 pages long :)
[04:20:49] <Freemo[m]> Vornicus: with the integration factor i applied though I do think im actually fairly close to a solution
[04:21:00] <Freemo[m]> so, lets see where I go :)

[04:30:33] <buster> i'm not up to following the maths. maybe after rereading some of baez. just nice to see where it fits in.
[04:31:16] <johnkeats6> in EM though the gauge group U(1) is abelian, so the formula is simpler: F_uv = del_u A_v - del_v A_u
[04:31:41] <johnkeats6> yang & mills realized in the non-abelian case you need to add [A_u, A_v]

[07:40:49] <biberao> butin my country its not
[07:41:34] <biberao> understand?
[07:41:35] <qergle> it's not the largest, it's the unique one in a convention-specific interval

[07:41:49] <biberao> i need to improve the lingo
[07:41:52] <biberao> thanks
[07:42:02] <qergle> the most common intervals are (-π,π] and (0,2π]
[07:42:44] <qergle> then you can just keep adding integer multiples of 2π to get more and more
[07:43:02] <biberao> i see
[07:43:04] <biberao> thanks
[07:43:30] <qergle> actually, i made a small mistake, usually it's 0 that's in. so [0,2π) is the other

[08:20:58] *** Joins: oxum (~oxum@122.172.39.197)
[08:21:09] <droid3> And there is the Big-M or two phase method when you got >= constraints
[08:21:11] <fluffyalpaca> man, i did one sequential quadratic programming one time and it was legitimately one of the hardest things I've done
[08:22:07] <droid3> havent gotten into discussing nonlinear programming algorithms but almost finished with coding up the linear programming simplex and big-m  algorithms
[08:22:11] <fluffyalpaca> it was a prototype for an algorithm to perform a lane change manuever for an autonomous vehicle.
[08:22:47] <fluffyalpaca> wicked hard. i died a little inside.
[08:23:19] <droid3> So lets keep it about LP not NLP just for simplicity at the moment. Dont worry all get to coding up NLP stuff some day but its alot more challenging since its NP hard not like LP where we can do it all in P.
[08:23:39] *** fluffyalpaca is now known as tusko
[08:24:36] <droid3> <fluffyalpaca> so for the general LP algorithm how would you solve a > or < constraint
[08:25:14] <droid3> Big-M and the simplex methods only account for <= , = , >=  constraints

[08:26:51] <droid3> not true we dont know P = NP yet and i believe there not equal

[08:28:12] <droid3> Is there an easy way to incorporate them into the big-m or simplex algorithms which only seem to support <= or >= constraint conditions?
[08:28:23] <cherim> With < constraints the extremum normally doesn't exist
[08:28:46] <cherim> Consider the x1<2, max x1 problem
[08:29:00] <cherim> The same will happen in the general multi-variable case
[08:29:27] <droid3> ya both < and > constraint conditions make it not bounded or no border limit to the feasible regions
[08:29:28] <cherim> And if you consider sup instead of max, you are back to <= constraints
[08:30:29] <droid3> that my issue my algorithm for LP using simplex and big-m only work for <= or >=
[08:30:49] <droid3> what do you do in the case of an LP with constraints with < or > ????
[08:31:02] <cherim> It's not an issue with an algorithm, it's an issue with problem setting
[08:31:13] <cherim> You don't solve badly-posed problems
[08:31:18] <droid3> thats what i am getting at is there some other algorithm for these or modification for the big-m or simplex that works for those type of constraints ???
[08:31:59] <int-e> droid3: do you want to optimize a target function or are you after satisfiability of the constraints?

[08:32:44] <droid3> O wait my bad i should have said this is NLP but the constraints where all linear and the objective function was nonlinear.
[08:34:40] <droid3> Ya my bad in a LP programming problem you never have the < or > conditions so sorry for the mistake in wording.
[08:34:56] <int-e> (for satsifiability there's a trick where you replace ax < b by ax + epsilon <= b, epsilon >= 0 and then basically start maximizing epsilon, I forgot the details)
[08:35:43] <int-e> But as long as you have an objective function, you have to deal with the possibility that the maximum doesn't exist.
[08:35:52] <int-e> err, optimum
[08:36:40] <droid3> ya thats the simplex algorithm with slack variables/basic variables and in the case of >= the do a modification of it called big-m which uses artificial variables with a larger or small M value.
[08:37:47] <droid3> But ya those only handle <= or >= constraints for an LP . I was wondering on the other constraints types that could occur < , > , = but i realize...
[08:38:01] <cherim> Do you understand what people are telling you? In the "x1<2, max x1 problem" what do you want as answer, regardless of the algorithm?
[08:38:20] *** Joins: frelleck (~frelleck@user/frelleck)
[08:38:47] <droid3> That < and > cannt be used as constraints in a LP because you have no min or max it be an infeasible setup in the first place.
[08:40:56] <droid3> yes cherim i do.
[08:42:15] <droid3> So let me recap big-m and slack variables take care of the <= , >= constraint cases.
[08:42:19] <int-e> droid3: So how wrong do things go for you if you replace the < by <=, do the optimization, and then check whether the optimum happens to satisfy the strict constraints as well?
[08:43:18] <droid3> we you can do that but then you have to go back and make sure its not an = case
[08:43:48] <int-e> that's the "then check" part
[08:44:01] <droid3> that kind of like whats the difference between the runtimes of a LP from an Integer program problem
[08:44:22] <droid3> IP = NP but LP = P :)
[08:44:39] <tusko> What would a 'second course in linear algerbra' look like? Do you just take linear algebra again or...?
[08:45:02] <droid3> because the IP is reduced to a LP by using branch cuts aka a branch /bound algorithm together with the LP algorithm
[08:46:52] <droid3> All i am getting at is i am wondering if there is any efficient methods to not have to check the = of a <= to differentiate  < from <= constraints

[08:48:13] <droid3> what i am asking now.
[08:48:38] <tusko> yeah, much clearer to me now >_>
[08:50:02] <droid3> And linear algebra is really more when the constraints are all = conditions and the objective function is linear and doesnt have a max or min condition.
[08:50:45] <droid3> You really need to know linear algebra at least a first course before you can learn the more general LP problems to me.
[08:51:58] <droid3> But ya for the most part if you understand slack variables, basic variables and know how to do Gaussian elimination with a few Big-m tricks (aka artifical variables ...)
[08:53:00] <droid3> then you pretty much understand how to tackle most LP problems and how to write the LP algorithms from scratch which is what i was doing. Havent done them all like ellispoidal method , ...etc yet
[08:53:32] <droid3> But getting there ...
[08:54:22] <droid3> Ya and we all probably know how to do LP out by hand for simple problems but i was using built in math functions in mathematica like software for so long.

[10:57:01] <PlanckWalk> "Harder than anything in NP" implies "harder than NP-complete" since all NP-complete problems are in NP.

[11:16:39] <PlanckWalk> But if you want to restrict to problems that have any realistic expectations of becoming feasible then NP is about it.
[11:16:55] <PlanckWalk> Maaaybe PSPACE.
[11:18:15] <mornfall> it's also really interesting how decision problems give an impossibly rich structure to the tiny, tiny set of natural numbers
[11:18:31] <droid3> ok that seems reasonable to me PlanckWalk by looking most things where falling into those complexity spaces.
[11:19:18] <PlanckWalk> And only even NP because of the hope that maybe it's secretly just P.
[11:19:30] <PlanckWalk> (And to be quite honest, even most of P is practically inaccessible)
[11:20:34] <zacts> is it possible for NP to both equal P and not equal P?
[11:20:36] <droid3> Ya its almost like the complexity classes model like the  number system (integers , rational , real , complex , algebraic , constructable numbers , noncomputable , computable ,...etc)

[11:23:36] <droid3>  Way beyond EXPSPACE"
[11:24:22] <droid3> Assuming we could solve every problem efficiently we wanted then where would all these new practical problems fall into
[11:24:43] <droid3> interms of complexity class that your talking about
[11:25:24] <droid3> And i am curious to hear about any algorithms above expspace say that would be practical application
[11:26:02] <PlanckWalk> Solving them in reasonable time/space would require come model of computing beyond Turing machines.
[11:26:19] <PlanckWalk> (Or any of our other practically realizable computing models)
[11:26:22] <zacts> mornfall: why is that, is this due to something like the law of the excluded middle?
[11:26:26] <droid3> for the most part as you go up farther and farther in complexity classes to me. It just gets harder and harder to find any existing practical problems we want to solve.
[11:26:32] <mornfall> droid3: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonelementary_problem
[11:26:40] <PlanckWalk> No, there are *lots* of problems we want to solve up there.
[11:26:57] <droid3> rather then theoretically constructed problems to extend / make a new complexity class
[11:26:59] <PlanckWalk> Just we don't have any way of doing it reasonably efficiently, so why bother.

[11:27:55] <PlanckWalk> But we can't.
[11:28:10] <PlanckWalk> So it doesn't get much discussion as a practical problem.
[11:28:11] <mornfall> those are problems that are known to be decidable, but cannot be solved in a time that's an exponential tower of the input size
[11:28:28] <droid3> well to me exponential runtime algorithms are usually where computer programmers stop coding
[11:28:32] <mornfall> many of them are quite practically interesting
[11:28:54] <PlanckWalk> droid3: Yes, they are.  Because if your algorithm has worse than exponential runtime, it's not likely to ever finish.
[11:29:03] <PlanckWalk> For even smallish inputs.
[11:29:50] <mornfall> PlanckWalk: unless there's a class of inputs where it's polynomial(ish), and that class is interesting to you
[11:30:04] <droid3> so then what is the most runtime complex practical problem we know of today as of current?
[11:30:19] <mornfall> droid3: \inf

[11:31:04] <PlanckWalk> Yes, there are problems where the general class has horrifically bad complexity, but we can try to solve easier instances and hope it works.
[11:31:31] <PlanckWalk> There are actually programs that try to solve problems of complexity equivalent to halting problem or worse.
[11:31:54] <PlanckWalk> Heck, even C++ compilers do that.
[11:32:25] <droid3> you cannt solve halting problem with any program

[11:34:51] <PlanckWalk> Usually you design them so that doesn't happen.  Because such things are annoying to maintain anyway.
[11:35:45] <PlanckWalk> Butyou asked about the theoretical complexity of practical problems, that's one.
[11:35:47] <droid3> Anyway the point i was trying to make is was there some most hardest practical problem out there or is it more like we keep finding harder and harder practical problems in larger/harder complexity classes
[11:36:14] <droid3> like the never ending orders of infinity or cardinal numbers or ordinal number
[11:36:17] <PlanckWalk> There really is no upper bound.
[11:36:30] <PlanckWalk> Well, there may be a *practical* upper bound
[11:36:57] <droid3> yes true in general i just didnt know for practical useful problems if there was an upper bound we where currently at in complexity classes
[11:37:00] <PlanckWalk> In the sense that you or me personally might not live long enough.
[11:37:14] <PlanckWalk> There are plenty of problems where we don't know the complexity class.

[13:58:55] <rendar> let's say in a bag there are 4 eggs, 3 white and 1 black..now, 4 people must randomly choose one egg from this bag, and then see if they took the black egg. the first guy chooses, so he has 1/4 probability of taking the black egg, the second guy chooses .. but he doesn't have the same 1/4 probability now that 1 egg is missing since it's has been picked from the first guy, right?
[13:59:35] <greenbagels> depends on how the problem is worded
[14:00:03] <rendar> what you mean?
[14:00:26] <greenbagels> does the first guy put his egg back, or hold on to it?

[14:01:33] <PlanckWalk> Mayeb the last guy randomly chooses the only egg left in the bag ;-)
[14:02:51] <PlanckWalk> So yes, the last person randomly chooses an egg from the 1 left :-)
[14:03:10] <rendar> :)
[14:03:15] <PlanckWalk> Which to be fair, is still a thing that has a distribution.  Just a very narrow distribution.
[14:03:24] <qergle> rendar if you can answer my question, you'll be on your way to understaning.
[14:03:33] <rendar> PlanckWalk: my point is that at every choose, probability changes
[14:03:42] <rendar> qergle: uhm
[14:03:54] <PlanckWalk> rendar: Conditional probabilities do, yes.
[14:03:59] <PlanckWalk> Unconditional ones don't.
[14:04:36] <greenbagels> i have a fun story about this
[14:04:37] <rendar> PlanckWalk: and, here we have conditional probabilities, i guess, because if i choose the black egg at first, the other guys will have 0 probability to pick it
[14:04:51] <qergle> but that is weighted
[14:04:52] <PlanckWalk> rendar: You can talk about the conditional probabilities sure
[14:05:02] <greenbagels> a prof once penalized me for not being able to tell whether an exam question implied drawing with or without replacement
[14:05:10] <PlanckWalk> But the end result is everyone has 1/4 chance of getting the black egg.
[14:05:10] <greenbagels> i just wrote up solutions to both assumptions lol
[14:05:12] <rendar> qergle: weighted? what you mean?

[14:06:01] <rendar> oh, right
[14:06:04] <qergle> or not quite, but that case is 1/4
[14:06:16] <PlanckWalk> P(2nd person draws black) = P(1st draws black) * 0 + P(1st draws white) * 1/3 = 1/4.
[14:06:21] <qergle> so all those get weighted
[14:06:35] <rendar> qergle: so, basically, there is not difference in proability if those guys choose eggs one after another, or everyone simultaneosuly
[14:06:50] <PlanckWalk> Or in terms of conditionals, P(1st draws black) * P(2nd draws black | 1st draws black) + ... etc
[14:06:51] <qergle> it's easier to not weight anything, and consider my question. which shows they all have the same prob of getting the black egg.
[14:07:41] <qergle> well, you can't really choose simultaneously (what happens if two want the same egg). but you can change it to a random distribution,
[14:08:42] <qergle> maybe if you think of it like this, strings of four characters made up of W,W,W,B. where the WBWW would mean #2 gets the black egg.
[14:09:02] <rendar> yes
[14:09:10] <greenbagels> or draw it like a tree
[14:10:06] <rendar> also, chosing simultaneosly doens't mean anything.. i mean, what is that? picking an egg in the same plank-time?

[19:14:57] <Z-module> hi cadmio
[19:15:23] <Z-module> scaleww: you mean like where the professor took attendance at class each time? I never had that.
[19:16:15] <scaleww> Z-module, yeah like maybe one to two hours a week or something where your presence was mandatory for some class
[19:17:59] <scaleww> Also Z-module, did you attend (most of) the lectures? And if you have and instruction classes (or something like that), where you are helped with homework instructions or where solutions to instructions were made available...did you attend (most of) such instruction classes?
[19:18:17] <Z-module> I never had one like that in college, for any subject, but I did have some very small seminar-type things (with 5 students or so) where it would have looked really terrible not to show up, and I pretty much  never missed those.
[19:18:39] <Z-module> I did attend, mostly
[19:18:48] <scaleww> Z-module, yeah we are about to have that seminar-type thing as well, but it's mandatory to be present here :(
[19:18:49] <tolarz> scaleww: i studied CS; attendance is never required here
[19:19:05] <Z-module> what's so bad about mandatory attendance for that, scaleww ?
[19:19:43] <Z-module> oh, we also had "recitations" sessions, where they went over homework etc. -- I did often skip those.
[19:19:43] <scaleww> Z-module, well i'm an older 'student' and have to work as well. Besides, university is pretty far from my home, so the less mandatory attendance the better.
[19:20:05] <scaleww> Z-module, lol really? I thought those might be more valuable than the actual lectures themselves.
[19:20:19] <Galois> in Taiwan they have assigned seats and anyone who misses class has their empty seat with their nametag on it photographed and posted on the course web page
[19:20:21] <Z-module> well it depended on how I was doing, I guess
[19:20:33] <scaleww> tolarz, yes, but is it doable to study remote/at home when you do not attend any lectures?
[19:20:42] <scaleww> Galois, lol
[19:21:18] <tolarz> scaleww: idk, i attended most lectures
[19:21:22] <tolarz> and now i am only writing my master's thesis
[19:21:24] <Galois> so attendance is mandatory and you get a humiliation penalty for missing class
[19:21:26] <scaleww> Z-module, how many hours a week were you busy studying?
[19:21:31] <Z-module> a whole lot
[19:21:41] <scaleww> like 40hours?

[19:54:07] <rubiksdream> well there is a simple answer to the question 'if you're not going to attend classes, why attend university', the answer is the piece of paper you get at the end if you need it for whatever you want to do after university
[19:54:37] <rubiksdream> that being said, that guy should attend his tutorials, the small classes are the most worth attending

[19:55:27] <Galois> attendance depends on a number of factors, there's no one size fits all approach. For one, do you really need the piece of paper? That makes a difference.
[19:55:58] <Galois> if you really know the material, and are doing it just for the piece of paper -- maybe you don't need to attend the tutorials. That's why I skipped almost all of them.

[19:58:41] <mousey> attendance not being mandatory is a really big help to those with caring responsibilities, or who travel far, ...
[19:59:07] <Galois> I mean, a high school kid learning about the number field sieve from the guy who invented the number field sieve ... that's a pretty rich opportunity, that I would have missed if I skipped class

[19:59:40] <rubiksdream> yeah , thats a good example of the sometimes hidden value of attendance
[20:00:07] <rubiksdream> that being said in some schools once the lecture time is up professors hang around for a maximum of five minutes, and there are likely going to be 5 students who want to ask him questions
[20:00:18] <rubiksdream> but yeah, your point still stands
[20:00:33] <Galois> oh he zipped out of the classroom super quick, I followed him and hounded him. Didn't take much hounding, but there was some effort involved.
[20:00:50] <rubiksdream> oh, fair
[20:01:19] <Galois> I think he was just super stoked that someone in the class could ask questions about real math

[23:45:00] <cherim> and x^18+1 factors as (1+x^2)(1-x^2+x^4)(1-x^6+x^12)

[23:45:37] <riv> oh nice idea to factor it
[23:45:41] <int-e> ? q = Mod(x,polcyclo(360)); 1/4*q^90 + 1/4*q^70 + 1/4*q^50 - 1/4*q^10 - 1/4/q^10 + 1/4/q^50   + 1/4/q^70 + 1/4/q^90  -->  %1 = Mod(0, x^96 + x^84 - x^60 - x^48 - x^36 + x^12 + 1)
[23:45:49] <cherim> For any expression commensurate with 10 degrees, you only have to divide the resulting polynomial in x by 1-x^6+x^12
[23:46:10] <cherim> No need to guess factors, only one mechanical division
