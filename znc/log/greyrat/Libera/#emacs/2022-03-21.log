[00:02:09] <artefact> sorry, un*x
[00:02:16] <wasamasa> so, there's many things that can go wrong
[00:02:24] <wasamasa> and you think that adding emacs magically fixes those, lol
[00:02:31] <wasamasa> no, it adds even more things that can go wrong

[00:09:22] <wasamasa> there is another one explaining buffering, but I cannot find it
[00:10:18] <parsnip> not the one about buffering of text editing, presumably
[00:10:20] <the_tubular> But what is exactly vterm or xterm or the other emacs terminal ?
[00:10:28] <parsnip> if that's even called buffering
[00:10:48] <parsnip> i think i added xterm on their just to illustrate the extreme
[00:10:53] <parsnip> *there
[00:10:59] <parsnip> vterm is the hottest new thing
[00:11:16] <parsnip> my impression is, it's the most faithful terminal thing inside emacs
[00:11:28] <parsnip> whereas eshell is like the most emacs-like
[00:11:30] <the_tubular> So it's a full blown terminal ?
[00:11:41] <parsnip> ielm is just not even a "shell", it's just an elisp repl
[00:11:47] <parsnip> close? idk
[00:12:12] <parsnip> for a while, M-x term was what you used if you wanted closest thing to terminal behavior
[00:12:25] <parsnip> and M-x shell was what you used if you wanted something more friendly to emacs usage
[00:12:58] <parsnip> M-x eshell was implemented in elisp, so you could use it on Windows for example
[00:13:23] <the_tubular> I'm not looking for "exact terminal behavior" I was wondering if emacs could handle the edge case I mentioned above, I think wasamasa said no though
[00:13:34] <wasamasa> no
[00:13:38] <wasamasa> it doesn't
[00:14:06] <parsnip> understood, i was just replying to your recent question
[00:14:09] <wasamasa> I mean, you cannot even access file descriptors from elisp
[00:14:48] <wasamasa> you can just fake them with (network) processes and have zero control over their buffering
[00:15:03] *** Joins: shnekel (~user@cpe-24-55-16-112.austin.res.rr.com)
[00:15:36] <wasamasa> emacs itself defaults to using a tty for subprocess control
[00:15:47] <wasamasa> which is a terrible default, pipes are more reliable for this
[00:16:18] <wasamasa> if you use a tty, you need to configure it to transmit raw characters, hence the stty incantation
[00:16:30] <the_tubular> Got it
[00:16:58] <wasamasa> if you use this on an interactive terminal, it makes it behave different from what you're used to because hitting C-c is no longer interpreted as a signal to interrupt whatever you're doing
[00:17:05] <wasamasa> instead it's sent to whatever it's hooked up to
[00:17:19] <the_tubular> Umm ...
[00:17:48] <the_tubular> For me to use socat, I need to have socat on the victim's machine too correct ?
[00:18:03] <wasamasa> the reason why you set TERM is for the remote side to know what control characters it's supposed to send back to render all the fancy things you're doing with your control characters
[00:18:09] <the_tubular> For it so the terminal stuff won't get in my way

[00:51:30] <technomancy> lexical binding makes it easy to understand "where is this value used?" and dynamic scope makes it easy to understand "when is this value used?"
[00:51:34] <corwin> it implies that it's easy to understand all of the scopes that may be involved when looking at some bit of code.
[00:51:54] <edrx> for me and for many beginners Emacs is fun exactly because the precise semantics of elisp is simple to understand
[00:52:01] <artefact> isn't this just guile emacs all over again?
[00:52:21] <technomancy> with dynamic scope, the value could be used anywhere in the code base (which can lead to difficult-to-debug mistakes) but at least you know when you exit the `let` it won't be used any more.

[00:57:57] <edrx> about 99% of the feedback that I on eev is from people who are learning elisp, so I see firsthand what are the difficulties that people have with elisp. some people only have contact with beginners who program in, say, C++, a lot, and for whom lexical binding is totally natural, but for some reason these people never talk to me
[00:58:25] <bpalmer> lexical binding in c++ really only shows up once they start using closures.

[01:07:37] <blinux> I only used emacs a little in the early 2000's and that was this discontinued Xemacs, and I didn't really use any of the keyboard shortcuts.

[01:08:51] <wasamasa> no worries, evil allows you to use emacs keys if you want to

[01:09:01] <artefact> use whatever you're used to. it's hard to grok new things
[01:09:09] <blinux> For serious programming in Go etc. I think I'd use the Jetbrains IDE, but for other functions. But I like the idea of Emacs for other things.
[01:09:39] <blinux> OK, yeah I saw a bit of the tutorial and started doing it. The welcome screen got me started.
[01:09:59] * sm uses a combination of emacs and IDE. It's good to have both a light sabre and a blaster handy.
[01:10:17] <blinux> I used to program in C using XEmacs on a Solaris system, just an interesting memory I have.
[01:10:27] <artefact> maybe try out a starter kit emacs to see what it's capable of. the vanilla emacs is a bit bare and discoverability of features is subpar
[01:10:50] <blinux> You mean like Space Emacs or DOOM Emacs?
[01:11:02] * sm would just watch videos for ideas, but start with vanilla + M-x list-packages
[01:11:04] <artefact> i started with prelude. it's less opinionated and closer to "true emacs"
[01:11:25] <blinux> I heard DOOM emacs uses EVIL mode and Space emacs uses the space key instead of control.
[01:12:28] <sm> (it depends: do you want to be able to use emacs anywhere, as you do vim, or are you planning to use only one souped-up instance of it on your home machine)

[01:12:38] <corwin> my advice is to start with "plain Emacs" at least until you finish the tutoral.  after that you might decide to try a "starter kit" such as Doom or Spacemacs
[01:13:03] <artefact> what do yoa mean? a true hacker never leaves home without his emacs on an appimage on a usb drive
[01:13:37] <blinux> OK. I also wonder how well the Emacs key bindings work in IDE's like Jetbrains as far as conflicting with the other keyboard shortcuts in that application. If Emacs uses control and alt, I imagine that could cause a problem. Jetbrains has plugins for VIM or Emacs key bindings.

[01:55:29] <corwin> Hmm. At least very crude coverage reports comparing ert forms with sources (find vars not in some version of `let' and not mentioned in an ert form) sounds kinda like it might be fun and easyish to do.
[01:56:35] <corwin> A huge amount of complexity is possible I guess, but if I tried to write something that worked per how I tend to write tests, I think I might be able to.
[01:57:35] <parsnip> i find that coverage alone can motivate some refactoring in places
[01:57:53] <parsnip> but also encourages making code testable, at which point it's easier to test for behavior when the issue arises

[10:01:32] <parsnip> then the web app thing became emphasized, and i struggled to get it to work for me
[10:01:40] <codingquark> It's still mostly CLI it seems
[10:01:40] <codingquark> jupyter is an add-on
[10:02:30] <parsnip> sure, but the attempt was to emphasize the web app, that's all i mean
[10:02:40] <parsnip> like a Windows user would have to install a VM
[10:02:41] <edrx> also, I don't want to convince the students that if they use the web apps such and such then they will plot 2D and 3D functions for them because they are wonderful and this is the future etc etc.
[10:02:44] <parsnip> iirc
[10:03:27] <parsnip> i have a vague recollection that long ago, people were trying to get it to build on Windows. but easily a false memory
[10:03:53] <parsnip> i think i was a Windows user at the time, and i was faced with using a VM to use it
[10:04:05] <parsnip> and still the slow install times
[10:04:08] <edrx> so I just told the students that my colleague from the university such and such had installed this thing that you can use in your cell phone - if you have a good cell phone - and it will plot functions for you. but these things don't work for me

[10:05:58] <edrx> so if you want to use these wondeful web tools for plotting functions please learn them and teach your colleagues, but I can't spend time from the course pretending that these things will certainly work
[10:06:29] <parsnip> "here's a visualization of the function we are considering. see how it will break the theorem at the origin, because we didn't check the conditions?"
[10:06:44] <codingquark> In your experience, the CLI version works all the time?
[10:06:52] <edrx> so in my course we will learn lots of tricks for plotting functions by hand doing relatively few calculation, and ta-da, problem solved =)

[17:50:37] <Minvera> the way it works is that it always cross compiles
[17:50:39] <bkhl> Running the language server on your target platform instead and accessing it remotely seems like a better bet.

[17:54:53] <Minvera> how would it know what compiler to use? how would the linter work?
[17:54:54] <bjc> you'll also need the lsp server on the target

Specifically, I'm getting a delay with basic navigation in AucTeX  (C-a, C-e, etc), so I'm assuming my emacs config has other stuff hooked onto or following on from move-beginning-of-line and move-end-of-line.

[22:08:46] <BrokenCog> I've been struggling with this python-mode and asked about indentation before ... but, I'm wondering if someone has any idea about changing the behavior ...  given this:  dhttps://termbin.com/ajt4 ... if I selected the entire text and pressed tab, I'd like it all to correctly indent.  However nothing changes.  Also, the snipped was all originally indented to col 8, without any region selected tab moved
[22:08:52] <BrokenCog> the first line to col 0, which is good, but, if I select the entire buffer, then nothign changes - which I can understand since line 1 is at 8.
