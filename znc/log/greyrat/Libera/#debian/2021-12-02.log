I am running this to remove some files: find a* -name "error_log" -type f -print | xargs rm -f, however, if the result from find contains a space in the file path, xargs rm -f receives only the partial path. How do I enclose it in double quotes, so it gets the entire string to rm?

[01:03:12] <Khepra> quite the contrary, xargs beats -exec in performance . -delete works only on files. use -print0 to send teh binary stream to xargs with -0  ; see both manpages for more info

[01:07:32] <TheAvatar> So in this case -delete should be fine - because it is files only, and it needs to remove only like 500 files. While -print0 would be the way to go, if I need to pipe it to something (it could be something else than xargs rm)

[01:10:01] <Khepra> at any rate, find | xargs is a very useful tool

[03:05:28] <dob1> how can nginx read the files if you do this?
[03:05:47] <Khepra> like I said, it's given read access to website's group
[03:06:07] <Khepra> but static files only. nginx doesn't need to touch php files
[03:06:24] <dob1> you give the files www-data group ?
[03:06:33] <Khepra> no, I put www-data user in website's group
[03:07:24] <Khepra> for example.  I have /home/somesite. (it's /srv/sites/... but let's say it's /home/).  I have 750 on /home. user:user owned. www-data (nginx) is in "user" group. /home/site has read access for the group
[03:08:10] <Khepra> atop of that, apparmor prevents nginx from reading PHP files
[03:09:20] <Khepra> I meant I have 750 on /home/<somesite>. This is unfortunately not default on debian, which is 755.
[03:09:21] <dob1> why nginx doesn't have to read php files?
[03:09:46] <Khepra> dob1: because it doesn't. nginx never reads PHP files, it only passes requested file _path_ to php-fpm via fastcgi
[03:09:59] <Khepra> if nginx read PHP files it's security incident as it exposes code and passwords.
[03:10:29] *** Joins: Wikiwide_ (~Wikiwide@user/wikiwide)
[03:11:00] <dob1> Khepra, ok but this is something that nginx do by itself, isn't it?
[03:11:23] <Khepra> that's different from old apache and mod_php, where apache was the one reading PHP files and interpreting them. with fastcgi, the processes are completely separate, you can literally run php-fpm on another physical machine. it's fastcgi protocol between the web server and php-fpm, that carries the request, and response content.
[03:12:08] <Khepra> dob1: no, again, nginx ONLY and ONLY serves static files. therefore if it touched PHP files, it'd serve them back as static because nginx has no clue how to interpret PHP. there's no mod_php for nginx
[03:12:40] <Khepra> instead, it passes the request via fastcgi to php-fpm, which, like I said, could be run on another physical machine. php-fpm then interprets PHP and returns whatever via fastcgi protocol, back to nginx.
[03:13:29] <dob1> Khepra, ok I agree with this, but once you configured it's safe, or am I wrong?
[03:13:43] <Khepra> but this nginx doesn't do automagically, at least not on debian. you have to explicitely configure path rules to be passed via fastcgi and not returned as static files
[03:13:51] <dob1> once you configure how nginx has to handle php files I mean
[03:14:03] <Khepra> dob1: it's "safe" until you touch the files again and accidentally make it unsafe
[03:14:53] <Khepra> therefore the MAC policy is there to ensure accidents remain access denied and happy little accidents,  instead of revealing website code, passwords and other things to random visitor
[03:14:53] <dob1> I got your point

When a request comes in for a Wordpress site (by URL), Traefik passes that to a Wordpress container, which has its own MySQL database container. Requests for webmail come into the Roundcube container. From within Roundcube, you can't see anything inside the Wordpress

[03:59:03] <rawtaz> thanks.
[03:59:11] <cheapie> I normally recommend keeping two kernel versions around for that reason, usually the current one and the one before it.
[03:59:27] <cheapie> IIRC this matches what apt autoremove does on its own anyway.
[03:59:34] <sney> yep
[04:00:21] <rawtaz> hm you mean that autoremove would remove the thirde oldest kernel image and everything older as well, keeping the two most recent ones? good to know, then one dont have to feel that this will be left around too long

[13:01:40] <Khepra> dob1: no, that discussion was solely about (not) using www-data for anything except maybe nginx itself, but definitely NOT for file ownership
[13:02:47] <Khepra> dob1: you have two facets of one problem, and the other facet is access to /var/log/files for which case the webapp user could be put into "adm" group ... OR ... put into a shared group for dedicated access to dedicated logs.
[13:03:35] <Khepra> dob1: I have no idea what goaccess is or does and what files it needs access to, but I'd apply the Principle of Least Privilege to anything, and limit the access as much as possible
[13:04:35] *** Joins: Hiccup (cHoy@user/hiccup)
[13:04:35] <dob1> Khepra, it has run mode: parse the log and generate a report (I use a cronjob for this),  realtime mode where it continues to read the log file
[13:04:42] <dob1> *two run mode
[13:05:09] <dob1> in the first one I use all the logs file from nginx, in the second one just access.log
[13:06:08] <Khepra> dob1: which files, just nginx' access log?
[13:06:29] <dob1> Khepra, all the access logs in the cronjob
[13:06:51] <Khepra> dob1: but, nginx access logs and not, say, auth.log or something more sensitive?
[13:07:09] <dob1> Khepra, no, just access.log*
[13:07:18] <Khepra> so in that case I would NOT give it access to whole "adm" group. Instead, I'd run your webapp as a dedicated user, and use ACLs to give that user access ONLY to access.log*
[13:07:55] *** Joins: krux02 (~krux02@194.8.199.29)
[13:07:58] <dob1> when it rotate and create a new one?
[13:08:13] <Khepra> dob1: but like somiaj initially suggested .. you need to define the threat model. perhaps this is all overkill and the treat model permits your webapp a wider access to adm group
[13:09:39] <krux02> I have a five in my file system called "Arne Döring " my real name, but when typing `ls` it lists it as 'Arne D'$'\303\266''ring '
[13:09:42] <Khepra> dob1: you can use a postrotate script step and do the setfacl on the newly pre-created access.log

[14:25:37] <dharmabums> I get bash: /lib/ld-linux.so.3: cannot execute binary file: Exec format error or ./myexecutable: cannot execute binary fil... when trying to run the arm binary directly
[14:26:27] <jelly> dharmabums, that's normal.  You can't run software for a different architecture.  Workaround: use an emulator, like qemu
[14:27:03] <jelly> the kernel can be set up to detect and call desired emulator automagically, using "binfmt"
[14:27:18] <dob1> Khepra, your advices is ok for the service that read the log file in realtime and generate a realtime report. But for the cronjob that read the logs and create the report all in once it doesnt matter I suppose, even if it is run as root (considering goaccess a safe app), imho

[14:27:53] <jelly> oh, arm64
[14:28:03] <dob1> Khepra, agree with this? or am I wrong?
[14:28:33] <Khepra> dob1: here's the thing. there was a class of vulns where crafted things would be injected into access logs, expecting specific log analyzers to read them and trip over and fall over a heap and into a RCE
[14:28:50] <jelly> dharmabums, ignore what I said.  I don't know how an aarch64 kernel works and whether it can run 32bit ABI
[14:28:57] <Khepra> so..... ANYTHING.... ANYTHING that might come from OUTSIDE of your server, which is server logs that log URLs and other things .... must NOT be trusted
[14:30:19] <dob1> Khepra, ok another topic, I am using fail2ban to ban auth basic fails, this is potentially a risk then
[14:30:22] <jelly> dharmabums, how did you install "ELF32 Arm ld-linux.so and glibc6:arm" ?  Did you add armhf or armel as foreign arch or did you do something manually?
[14:30:32] *** Quits: yupthatguy (~Thunderbi@herocloudhosting.com) (Remote host closed the connection)
[14:31:35] <Khepra> dob1: yes and no. with auth, the bits of the log entry are fully constructed by the server-side programs.  with nginx access logs, the query STRINGS are craftable by outside sources
[14:32:30] *** Joins: yupthatguy (~Thunderbi@49.159.110.42)
[14:32:33] <Khepra> dob1: it's technically possible to chain the vulns, so that you coerce, say, open-ssh into logging arbitrarry strings into auth.log expecting to trip a SpecificLogAnylizer.exe but that's.... academic theory. in practice there's balance of probabilities, but at the end of the day: Principle of Least Privilege
[14:32:42] *** Joins: barteks2x (~barteks2x@c140-57.icpnet.pl)
[14:32:43] <dob1> Khepra, to generate the report on the cronjob imho then it's simpler to copy logs file to a temp dir, change ownership and run the analyzer
[14:33:08] <Khepra> dob1: I'd definitely do that.
[14:33:19] <Khepra> run as root as LITTLE as possible. privsep all the things.
[14:33:44] <barteks2x> I'm getting some issues with cd/dvd/bluray drive - when I eject the disk and put the next one in, it will fail to read the data, unless I eject it from command line (which sometimes doesn't work because "device or resource busy"). Any idea why?
[14:34:00] <dob1> Khepra, I still have to work on the realtime service then, but I will try the hook on logrotate
[14:34:13] <Khepra> dob1: ACLs on that one
[14:35:10] <barteks2x> This is really annoying because I'm trying to figure out which of my old CDs and DVDs are readable

[16:33:05] <barteks2x> I recently started getting a random issue with my system: sometimes it just completely locks up for no apparent reason (even capslock/numlock on the keyboard doesn't respond). /var/log/syslog just stops at that moment, no output from that. How can I figure out what is the issue?
[16:33:26] <barteks2x> I read that some issues like that happened on ryzen 3000 series and older, but I'm on ryzen 5900X
[16:34:29] <Haohmaru> weren't you who had freezing during copying from a running root partition onto another device with dd?
[16:34:36] <Haohmaru> or was it rebooting even
[16:34:50] <barteks2x> I don't remember it being me
[16:35:00] <Haohmaru> okay
[16:35:49] <barteks2x> This time I actually got a corrupted file due to that (reports IO error from an SSD)
[16:35:52] <Haohmaru> well, i've had random freezings usually when something's not right with a videocard (one that's on a slot and wasn't making good contact), or RAM problems
[16:36:13] <barteks2x> and it happens randomly even when the system is completely idle
[16:36:20] <Haohmaru> yeah
[16:37:12] <Haohmaru> my videocard was probably slowly drifting out of the slot due to vibrations until suddenly it doesn't make good contact and something sh*ts up
[16:37:27] <Haohmaru> then the whole system freezes
[16:39:09] <barteks2x> it is screwed in properly so I doubt the gpu would slide out
[16:39:17] <barteks2x> (also it's an ancient, small gpu)
[16:39:43] <barteks2x> RAM may be a suspect as I had issues getting it to run at advertised DOCP profile
[16:40:26] <Haohmaru> did you run stuff like memtest on it?
[16:41:50] <barteks2x> I don't remember, but I don't think I did yet. I probably should. Also on the first POST after power on from completely disconnected power, it beeps at first and reboots once and then works

[16:42:38] <barteks2x> also for RAM problems, I would have expected it to cause other issues too, not *just* freezes

[17:06:27] <Khepra> dob1: it's not invoking rc script, it's using systemctl to signal the process, because systemd knows the pid to signal
[17:07:05] <Khepra> dob1: and that's because nginx takes signals for certain behaviour. USR1 reopens logs. USR2 and WINCH are used for graceful master upgrade/restart, etc...

[17:08:00] <Khepra> dob1: looking at your paste, the default logrotate.d/nginx file only requires a setfacl, no need to change into invoke-rc.d
[17:08:58] <dob1> Khepra, it was still there
[17:09:02] <Khepra> and that -f test is redundant as logrotate is already creating the file with permissions and ownership, so it _must_ be there. but sure, failsafes...    [ -f /var/log/nginx/access.log ] && setfacl [...]

[17:12:03] <Khepra> well you know what. I have systemctl USR1 signalling. Now I'm not sure if I wrote that or debian had it in the past. It's in my automation and on all the servers. but installing nginx in a clean env, I see invoke rc crap

[17:13:37] <dob1> I just need to remvoe the test and it's ok
[17:13:44] <dob1> I suppose
[17:14:42] <Khepra> you can keep the test as failsafe so logrotate doesn't produce errors
[17:15:17] <Khepra> then again ... not having the logfile at that point IS an error, a grave one as that means logrotate failed for some reason, and there's nothing to setfacl, and that cascades to your webapp being unable to read the file

[18:51:00] <dpkg> The enter key is not a substitute for punctuation.  Hitting enter unnecessarily makes it difficult to follow what you are saying.  Consider using ',', '. ', ';', '...', '---', or ':' instead.  If you hit enter too often, you will be autokicked for flooding the channel.
[18:51:12] <jelly> would have avoided the bot trigger
[18:52:03] <rawtaz> i know that. but the bot was still a bit too trigger happy IMO. evidently that user didnt cause any harm and they were happily asking a debian question, so they didnt deserve a kick

[22:27:01] <somiaj> depends on your definition of character, probably doesn't support -$, -%, -', and so on
[22:27:14] <somiaj> add utf-8 characters to the mix, and now supports very little of them
[22:27:16] <dbristow> somiaj, I'm only saying a-zA-Z
[22:28:00] <somiaj> I figured, I'm just finding loopholes

[22:29:32] <dbristow> dob1, Yup, -y is correct
[22:29:40] <dbristow> I'm just saying there aren't that many
[22:30:01] <dob1> the point is that I think nobody remember all of them ;)
[22:30:01] <dbristow> Of course I think the weirdest command is gnu ps, tries to be all things to all people.
[22:30:14] <lastshell> ahh you right
[22:30:14] <dbristow> dob1, Yup.
