[12:13:25] <ERROH> whole lotta our tests fail because of dst change
[12:14:04] <Faux> :D
[12:14:42] <Faux> We used to have that when I worked on SCHEDULING TELEVISION. Like, I understand how regular businesses who occasionally deal with time would have this problem; it's just an annoying problem that happens occasionally in some date code we don't normally touch.
[12:15:55] <Faux> I, who am apparently a manager, had a different problem; I have back-to-back meetings from ~14:00->17:00 most days. Many of these are with US West Coast folks, whos DST hasn't yet changed. Google Calendar applies DST to the meeting times (correctly?), so if you have a 1400, 1500, and 1600 meeting, and the 1500 meeting was scheduled by someone in the US, then two of your meetings now overlap for
[12:15:57] <Faux> this week.
[12:16:33] <ERROH> i'm loving it
[12:18:35] <lionkor> Faux: wow that is so horrible
[12:22:04] <Faux> (I meant US East Coast, not that it matters too much.)
[12:22:24] <T`aZ> sounds logically messy
[12:22:45] <T`aZ> protip: avoid time, dont interact with people
[12:22:55] <Faux> Amen.
[12:25:44] <ERROH> i love time in it
[12:25:49] <ERROH> fuck p-np
[12:26:04] <ERROH> solving time is worthy opponent
[12:26:26] <Faux> The JS people are trying to make a new Time api which is better than their existing one, wihch doesn't exist.
[12:26:31] <Faux> I look forward to dying of laughter.
[12:28:09] <ERROH> i love how my coworkers are putting .UTC() all over golang time interactions, even though it mostly doesn't matter because underlying timepoint is utc anyways
[12:28:25] <ERROH> but they were thought to be afraid and you can see that fear
[12:30:10] <Faux> The time library I was using before in rust had a difference between a UtcDateTime and a OffsetDateTime; OffsetDateTime has .UTC() which returns a different type; UtcDateTime has toOffset(tz).
[12:30:29] <Faux> The new one does not have this, they just have OffsetDateTime at the type level and it can be utc or not.
[12:31:01] <Faux> I think I preferred the original because I'm generally dealing with unix timestamps in my head, not dates.
[12:35:06] <ERROH> i don't know which i prefer
