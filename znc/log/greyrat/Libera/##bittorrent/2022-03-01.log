[01:06:31] <TheSHADOW> It's good for all sorts of different things as well - maybe too many different things.  :-P
[01:06:49] <TheSHADOW> Er.  Sorry.  Meant to paste:
[01:07:06] <TheSHADOW> https://www.amazon.com/AMD-Ryzen-5950X-32-Thread-Processor/dp/B0815Y8J9N/ - $600 right now
[01:19:25] <The_8472> those many-core processors are great if you can keep them fed. still too many sequential bottlenecks in a lot of software
[01:21:50] <DeHackEd> I'm satisfied with my 3900X (only 12 cores, Zen2)

[18:13:13] <TheSHADOW> The_8472: A lot of software is now written for mass-threading.  Also, taken a look at your process list lately?  Spreading those out among multiple cores helps keep things smooth.  (Though 24 threads from a 3900X is pretty good.)

[20:08:00] <The_8472> TheSHADOW, sure, if you have many processes running then having some spare capacity for the background stuff to nibble on is fine
[20:08:24] <The_8472> but outside of number-crunchy things like video-processing or rendering I often see things suffering from amdahl's law
[20:09:00] <The_8472> even heavy compilation tasks get bottlenecked on linker steps or thin some particular component in the dependency graph
[20:09:14] <The_8472> it's still faster with more cores, just not linearly faster
[20:09:37] <The_8472> the most horrible example are windows updates
[20:10:05] <The_8472> I see 1 thread out of 128 being busy with antivirus/installer stuff when installing updates.
[20:10:36] <The_8472> even though unpacking and scanning files in parallel seems like it would be trivial
