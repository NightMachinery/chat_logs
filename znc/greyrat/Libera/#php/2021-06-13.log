[09:11:12] <jargon> $pagedata = trk_fastregex( $pagedata );
[09:11:37] <Blondie101010> to test it and see what you're getting, we need to $pagedata contents
[09:12:31] <Blondie101010> either way, a typical approach to troubleshoot it is to add traces or use a debugger (both comparable approaches)
[09:12:35] <Rockwood> anymore way to do else part

[09:25:48] <jargon> {{foo|bar}} should become <a href="./?foo=bar">bar</a>

[22:57:31] <ZeroBeholder> ...what is the difference between #php and ##php on Libera?
[22:57:48] <ZeroBeholder> My general plan is that when I ask a question, it costs me an hour. During that hour I stick around and help if I can. Is this the right channel? The other channel has a more detailed banner message...
[22:58:04] *** Quits: P1RATEZ (piratez@user/p1ratez) ()
[22:59:10] <ZeroBeholder> *This channel has a more detailed banner message -- making me think this is the channel most appropriate for a intermediately skilled nobody like myself.
[22:59:29] <Derick> I thought ##php was "deprecated" in favour of this one?
[22:59:40] <__adrian> this is the official one, yes
[22:59:49] <Derick> __adrian: Hi Adrian :-)
[22:59:56] <__adrian> the plan was to have both and redirect, but for some reason we don't have ## yet
[22:59:59] <__adrian> hi
[23:00:31] <Derick> I know this is the official one... as I confirmed that with Libera ;-)
[23:01:02] <Derick> they wanted me to put up some text on php.net! I told them they could have downloads.php.net/~derick/something instead. Can't be arsed messing about with php.net
[23:01:11] <__adrian> :)
[23:08:52] <Naktibalda> no option to create a branch in php repo?
[23:09:19] <renic> sticking around to answer questions after asking them is good etiquette... kudos to you ZeroBeholder.

[23:46:35] <__adrian> though it is "actually" official now, even though we don't advertise that
[23:46:41] <da_wunder> but still it says "Otherwise known as IRC. Here you can usually find experienced PHP people sitting around doing nothing on various channels with php in their names. Note that there is no official IRC channel."
[23:47:11] <da_wunder> so I would not call this a official channel...
[23:47:24] <__adrian> sure. s/official/real/
[23:48:01] <__adrian> doesn't really make a difference in the long run
[23:48:23] <__adrian> "this (libera/#php) is the one you're looking for"
[23:48:35] <da_wunder> I would call that "community support"

[23:56:03] <da_wunder> this irc channel or any other of those aren't official support channels accord to php.net - so why not make that clear to users?
