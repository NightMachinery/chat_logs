[00:01:00] <JimBuntu> Howdy Joanna !  Well, I think this has been brewing for a long time... a very long time.  Half of the Ukraine is the homeland of the Rus.  It's a mix of people that have lived their for a very long time and that was complicated during the soviet era when people were forced out and others forced in.
[00:01:25] <JimBuntu> *there
[00:04:17] <Joanna> JimBuntu: it seems to be a trend  lately for Russia to not tolerate the antics of nato like they did back when Yugoslavia was destroyed
[00:05:11] <JimBuntu> Joanna, I think the whole NATO thing is a cover.  Everyone should want to own the Ukraine, it's resource rich... had been all the way back in history and only richer through time as we found more resources.
[00:05:36] <Joanna> Apparently the threat of nuclear missiles next to them was the last straw.
[00:05:52] <JimBuntu> more cover
[00:06:49] <JimBuntu> Although, given that it's been a goal to reclaim the Ukraine... of course they don't want them to be able to defend themselves or have the support of others.
[00:06:59] <Joanna> Nato has controlled it since the russia friendly government was removed with a coup in 2014
[00:07:17] <JimBuntu> "russia friendly" lol, that's one way to say it
[00:08:11] <Joanna> I don’t think there is any chance for Ukraine to be autonomous it’s not strong enough.
[00:08:35] <JimBuntu> It needs time to become strong, 30 years wasn't enough with all the interference.
[00:09:03] <Joanna> People won’t leave it alone it seems
[00:09:28] <JimBuntu> Countries sure wont. I think it's silly to think that they would... as I said... it's resource rich.
[00:10:14] <Joanna> They say that there was a promise when Gorbachev allowed East Germany to reunite that nato would not expand but that promise was broken
[00:11:01] <JimBuntu> Fine. Dismantle NATO and make a new group. Problem solved... in reality, the problem will never be solved.  Some groups of people still want to control everything... some hide it more than others.
[00:11:30] <Joanna> It’s not just Ukraine. There is a long list of color revolutions and meddling near Russia and Iran
[00:11:45] <JimBuntu> The simple idea that a group like NATO wouldn't be able to expand is laughable.
[00:11:55] <Joanna> Indeed
[00:12:02] <JimBuntu> I agree, it's not just Ukraine
[00:12:22] <Joanna> They destroyed Libya for the fun of it.
[00:12:53] <JimBuntu> Iran still has their eyes on other places that are now their own nation too.  These old issues take literal generations to resolve... can't keep picking the scabs.
[00:13:01] <Joanna> They tried to destroy Syria but Russia rescued it
[00:13:36] <JimBuntu> The age of empires is ending... hopefully.  It's now time for united countries while staying individual.
[00:13:46] <Joanna> I was surprised that Mexico refused to join sanctions
[00:14:14] <JimBuntu> It's a crazy large theatre natinos are playing in and it changes every day.
[00:14:22] <JimBuntu> *nations
[00:15:16] <Joanna> When Russia stopped the mischief in Georgia I don’t remember it escalating so much
[00:15:41] <JimBuntu> keep watching.  Putin and his people play the long game.
[00:16:02] <JimBuntu> To be fair though, most nations play the long game
[00:16:06] <Joanna> Isn’t Putin in the world economic forum?
[00:16:32] <JimBuntu> I think that's public and known, yes
[00:17:03] <Joanna> Russia had the same Covid policies as a lot of other countries so maybe they are controlled opposition
[00:18:01] <Joanna> _inky: are you around
[00:19:17] <Joanna> I some people say that Russia is like a third world country with white people once you are outside of the cities . Is that true?
[00:20:33] <JimBuntu> Joanna, have you not watched travel logs from the inner Federation?  Lots of it out there.  I find the borders most interesting, especially with China.
[00:22:09] <Joanna> I’ve read gulag archipelago. That and google maps is all I know about Russia for the most part.
[00:22:47] <JimBuntu> Oh, ok. A good one for an introduction is balder on youtube, but there are quite a few people who just travel and talk to small-town people
[00:22:55] <Joanna> I can say they make some beautiful buildings
[00:23:19] <JimBuntu> As always, it's important not to confuse the people with their government ;) 
[00:23:35] <Joanna> I like to watch their military parades..
[00:24:12] <Joanna> Government is people following orders.
[00:24:24] <JimBuntu> following and barking, yes
[00:24:51] <Joanna> Most government workers are dogmatic
[00:25:11] <Joanna> It’s not really magic
[00:25:15] <JimBuntu> Although governments employ a large portion of their peoples... most of those employees are doing regular jobs... just like we don't blame a cashier for the prices or confuse them as representative of the company they work for
[00:26:03] <JimBuntu> And this is all without even questioning elections/etc or who really pulls the strings ;)
[00:26:17] <Joanna> Their help is crucial though
[00:27:43] <Joanna> Most government workers just don’t want to get in trouble... so if they need to kill you to avoid trouble so be it.
[00:28:44] <JimBuntu> I have a meeting to crash, need to run. Nice chatting, ttyl /wave
[00:29:28] <Joanna> Bye
