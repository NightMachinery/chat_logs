[00:09:49] <_genuser_> I'm not necessarily saying microservices are better. I'm seeing some places where I think that makes sense. More than anything, I think what makes sense is actual need for a tool/pattern. instead of just blindly doing because everybody else is doing it.
[00:10:01] <_genuser_> plus learning kubernetes, etc. just makes it a marketable skill on your resume.

[00:12:28] <bomb> it's marketable for sure. that's probably why they're created in the first place
[00:13:04] <bomb> like how entry barrier to "modern" JavaScript is so high. you gotta live for a few weeks in a sewer line to learn all that bullshit
[00:13:12] <bomb> that what keeps JS devs salaries relatively high.
[00:13:31] <_genuser_> at this point, it's more about charging higher salary than really worrying about the best tool for the job.
[00:13:58] <_genuser_> ultimately, the architect was showing us how data dog will ping all the microservices 10 times per minute from different parts of the world.
[00:15:07] <_genuser_> so some no name company has all these services and cloud providers like AWS and Azure and GCP and IBM/Oracle providers will all corrupt the network no issues. But people will cry tears for bitcoin "destroy the planet" due to energy use. And then refuse to believe that part of that energy is from "re-usable" sources.

[01:37:34] <Cecen> Beautiful. An API server receives a request, asynchronously forwards the request to a microservice that does some trivial calculation, and then makes a request back to that same API server to write the result to a database.

[01:37:57] <Suchiman> Cecen: awesome!
[01:38:45] <Suchiman> Cecen: and then you gotta poll for the result from the api server to have it being retrieved from the database?

[02:33:34] <Suchiman> lz_: yeah the auto emptying isn't really a concern for me, i upgraded to the S7 from a dumb one like you have because the S7 also wishes the floor and does it well, it can wish and vacuum at the same time. And while the random pattern overall kept the floor clean, when the bot works with strategy and maps you can just tell it to clean this zone you draw on your phone and it will do that! It also takes less time to clean the same space since
[02:33:34] <Suchiman> it will only ever pass a space once and not do 3 times the same lane and skip a corner over there until the next or overnext time. I caught myself just using the remote of the bot to drive the bot near my desk manually, which dirties up quickly, to get ALL the dirt out. And i've started doing adjusting my behavior to having a robot slave, basically i just throw everything to the floor and call the bot to clean it up lol

[04:08:32] <Suchiman> when you brush your teeth in order to go to bed just to look at your glucose to see it's too low when the feeling sets in that its too low so you have to eat glucose...
[04:08:51] <Suchiman> tooth brushing: am i a joke to you?
[04:09:10] <jonp> "joke"? no.  just irrelevant.
