[00:09:46] <lisp123> thuna`: I like the detailed docstring on LET-BINARY
[00:10:01] <lisp123> My suggestion would be to break up the macro more, its very long
[00:10:32] <thuna`> It uses the varlist variable a lot inside the push'es so I think(?) it's better like this
[00:11:23] <lisp123> I don't program that much in elisp, but assuming their treatment of macros is same as CL, I don't think thats too much of an issue
[00:11:31] <lisp123> Macros keep lexical scope
[00:11:42] <lisp123> since they are expanded in place
[00:11:56] <thuna`> I would have to pass ,point to all of the functions, wouldn't I?
[00:12:03] <lisp123> I dont think so
[00:12:10] <thuna`> Since it's a gensym
[00:12:13] <lisp123> If it were a CL macro, you wouldn't
[00:12:28] <lisp123> oh hmm
[00:12:31] <lisp123> not sure tbh
[00:12:39] <wasamasa> what the fuck are you doing with that macro?
[00:12:47] <wasamasa> destructuring a buffer?
[00:12:56] <thuna`> destructuring an id3 tag
[00:13:01] <wasamasa> oh lol
[00:13:11] <thuna`> My previous attempt was even worse
[00:13:31] <thuna`> I basically tried to write out the macroexpanded form of this
[00:13:39] <wasamasa> I think the need for a macro is lessened if you port the few workhorse functions they use in PCL for that
[00:14:08] <thuna`> I'm not confident but I think PCL uses the reader functions, no?
[00:14:14] <lisp123> have a think carefully, but i strongly advise to find a way to split it up, its way too long and macros are already more error-prone than functions

[02:56:09] <bobdobbs> Hi all. I had to leave my home-office for a few days so I grabbed a laptop to install emacs on. (as well as doing actualy work from). I didn't want to spend ages installing emacs and re-creating my configs, so I installed spacemacs. And I really like it!
[02:56:16] <bobdobbs> It's great!

[02:56:41] <bobdobbs> But there are a couple of things I have to tweak, and I'm not show how to go about it
[02:57:23] <bobdobbs> So spacemacs is fitted out well for working with html, including plugging in yassnippet
[02:57:49] <bobdobbs> but I'm not sure how to get yas-expand working with TAB
[02:58:08] <technomancy> isn't that like ... The Problem With Spacemacs?
[02:58:20] <bobdobbs> I've created a snippet for web-mode. And it exands if I do 'M-x yas-expand'
[02:58:49] <technomancy> like it seems really good at first and then when you want to change even simple things it takes 3x as long as it normally would
[02:58:49] <bobdobbs> At home if I want to expand a string I hit TAB.
[02:58:57] <bobdobbs> oh dear
[02:59:55] <bobdobbs> I guess, for starters... how can I discover which key combo is bound to 'yas-expand'?

[03:01:02] <pinoaffe> bobdobbs: try C-h f yas-expand <ret>
[03:02:21] <bobdobbs> ok. 'C-h f yas-expand' gives me back this: http://pastie.org/p/1lYCnPpt6ADAhYkO1GJIZO
[03:02:48] <kiki_lamb> So you can see it's bound to a menu item and to no keys.
[03:02:53] <bobdobbs> yup

[03:19:10] <markofcorn> Until last night, it worked fine. I don't know what I changed or how to fix the issue. To me it seems like it just doesn't consider init.el to be a file buffer

[09:34:09] <Aurora_v_kosmose> bpalmer: In Emacs source itself maybe, I won't check. But it can be used for full-on literate programming.
[09:35:25] <yeti> I tried to nudge some microcontrollr coders to use org...  it ended worste than I expected.   What I expected was 95% shitstorm and 5% interested replies...   I got 0 replies!   that really felt stranger than a shitstorm

[09:36:10] <mon_aaraj> rip
[09:36:11] <bpalmer> Aurora_v_kosmose: the emacs source itself does not try for "literate programming." Almost every example I have seen of someone's literate config is maybe a lot of writing when they first started, soon trickling off into section heading and one or two lonely sentences of writing.
[09:36:44] <bpalmer> Contrast with Knuth's examples of literate programming, which are effectively academic articles or even textbooks dissecting the code.
[09:37:57] <Aurora_v_kosmose> bpalmer: Right, that's fair. Though that concerns more lacking application of the ability than lack of the ability.

[13:47:24] <bkhl> Both of those are major modes?
[13:47:31] <blaub> yeah
[13:47:33] <bpalmer> blaub: auto-mode-alist matches against the entire file path , so the simplest way is to simply make the first match in auto-mode-alist handle that template folder differently.
[13:47:44] <bkhl> If so I guess you could add somethign to the PHP mode hook that checks the file path and switches mode when you want to.
[13:48:03] <blaub> thank you guys, lots of input, going to look into it...!
[13:48:07] <bkhl> Or what bpalmer said, that sounds better. :-)
[13:48:19] <blaub> i guess php-mode enables itself by default so i only need to look for that template folder
[13:48:33] <bpalmer> blaub: bkhl's approach would work, as would simply inserting a file local variable in the template (e.g.,  <!-- -*- mode: web-mode -*- --> )
[13:49:11] <bkhl> blaub, if php-mode is enabled automaticaly now it's because it's in auto-mode-alist already
[13:49:42] <bkhl> So if you go that way, you need to make sure you insert your entry so that it's matched before the default one for PHP.

[14:52:14] <lucerne> (I had used `-e` initially, which did not work.)

[14:54:44] <lucerne> +
[14:55:57] <gnoo> any way to tell if a file is text file in elisp? preferably without putting it in a buffer first
[14:58:16] <lucerne> gnoo: Use a subprocess with `file -b --mime-type some_file`
[14:58:20] <bpalmer> what does it mean to be a text file?
[14:58:38] <gnoo> not a binary or pdf or djvu file
[14:58:41] <lucerne> `'^(text/|application/json)'` are text files.
[14:58:45] <bpalmer> in (almost, if not) all modern OSes, files are just bytes on disk.
[14:59:29] <bpalmer> one heuristic to say that something is a text file would be "it could be decoded as ASCII, or UTF-8, or UTF-16, or ..." and enumerate the common textual encodings.
[15:00:05] <bpalmer> that doesn't mean it might not *also* be a valid image file, if interpreted in that way.
[15:00:12] <lucerne> I like to install and enable `evil` using `emacs -q --eval ...`. Is it possible to do easily?
[15:00:34] <lucerne> (I want this for containers where I can't bother to install my whole config.)
[15:00:42] <bpalmer> gnoo: in practice, something like lucerne's suggestion of using 'file' may be easiest, but it's just doing these heuristics for you.
[15:01:31] <gnoo> ok, i was trying to avoid that since it depends on external tools but maybe it won't be so bad :)
[15:02:19] <bpalmer> gnoo: you could try doing a find-file and then checking to see what coding system it was detected as.

[17:50:23] <Diablo-D3> which is "fine" because you can type "Iosevka Extended" as the name in a lot of apps and get the same
[17:50:26] <Diablo-D3> in emacs this works
[17:51:15] <mwnaylor> Now I think I see. The are two stacks. A forward and a back. Current node is a stack item. Depending which direction the user move, current gets pushed onto one stack, then the other stack gets popped to get the new current item. It's a bit like juggling.
[17:51:42] <Diablo-D3> in atom and vscode (due to how they parse font names instead of just directly using it as the CSS font name), and windows terminal (they're trying to add proper OTF attributes, because their own in-house font, Cascadia Code, needs it) cannot set Iosevka's width
[17:51:55] <mwnaylor> s/The are/There are/

[20:40:23] *** Joins: aartaka (aartaka@gateway/vpn/protonvpn/aartaka)
[20:41:03] <acdw> so it sounds like the auth-source store for the secrets API might need shimming anyway? shims all the way down

[20:42:24] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Because obviously webkit != qt
[20:42:43] <acdw> yeah that makes sense. but it seems less useful if it doesn't specify at least some standard keys for lookup

[20:47:30] * TRS-80 is also a KeePass user
[20:47:43] <acdw> auth-source has a secret-store backend
[20:47:50] <Aurora_v_kosmose> KeepassXC users represent~
[20:48:02] <acdw> KeePassXC can make its database visible via libsecret
[20:48:31] <TRS-80> KeePassXC does have a command line client as well.  Which I played with, but only briefly.  Maybe your way is easier though.
[20:48:41] <acdw> so, you can read your KeePassXC database from Emacs, but the usual keys for lookup (e.g., :user, :host) aren't returned

[20:55:42] <TRS-80> Right.  And I am sure many other as yet unseen use cases in future.
[20:55:56] <acdw> autotype is good most of the time, but for that tighter integration w/ emacs i want a shim
[20:56:18] <acdw> lort, isnt't that why XC was a thing in the firstplace? XC stands for cross-compile i think!
[20:56:23] <Aurora_v_kosmose> May or may not be possible for libhandy to just have some shim to preload and override the calls like the PulseAudio vs Pipewire transition path offers.
[20:56:33] <TRS-80> AutoType even works for me in Emacs so far.
[20:57:30] <TRS-80> XC I think is because they took over / forked from KeePassX or KeePassC or some other GNU/Linux package which came before.  But became unmaintained, and they picked up the torch.  Been doing actually a very great job maintaining and extending it so far (for the most part).

[22:35:55] <Aurora_v_kosmose> describe-function tells what bindings are bound to a function. describe-key tells what functions for a keybind.
[22:36:47] <Aurora_v_kosmose> describe-bindings lists them all. describe-mode can also be enlightening.
[22:36:49] <markit> thanks!
[22:36:56] <Aurora_v_kosmose> For the matter, most of the functions we're naming are under the C-h prefix.
[22:37:09] <Aurora_v_kosmose> You can (usually) use ? after a keybind prefix to know all underlying bindings.
[22:37:16] <Aurora_v_kosmose> C-h ? will tell you all help functions, for example.
[22:37:28] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Assuming you have the default bindings active, if you changed them then who knows.

[23:06:20] <TRS-80> markit: If it makes you feel any better, it took me some years, and at least 3 attempts, before I finally 'got off the ground' with Emacs.  But once I achieved liftoff, there was no going back.  I have now become meme where I do (almost) everything in Emacs.  Even writing my own packages now, some of which I even released.  But it takes time.  IMO, the time investment (while large) is worth it, as
[23:06:22] <TRS-80> there is simply nothing else which is an equivalent tool.  But it is a highly complex tool, you can use your whole lifetime, and requires an according level of time investment.
