[00:05:33] <Panther> People wear sandals when it's warm to keep their feet dry and cool. Do not ruin the creator's purpose by putting on socks. If all those reasons are not enough and you are still going to do it, here is the ultimate argument: a guy who wears sandals with socks looks like a loser. No exception to that rule.
