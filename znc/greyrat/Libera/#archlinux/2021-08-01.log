[01:28:38] <kevr> but most of them won't do your whole pushing to your postfix spool for you.

[02:02:16] <hornetfighter515> yeah i kept telling the guys who helped build my pc that i didn't want nvidia, but they didn't listen, and although the card runs immaculately with windows, i wanted something linux compatible
[02:02:22] <raster> you shouldnt NEED nvidia's xconfig tool to configure x
[02:02:33] <MrElendig> grps got rebuilt but apparently sysdig is not rebuit yet
[02:02:36] <raster> xrandr would configure screens just fine on any x driver
[02:02:40] <MrElendig> grpc*
[02:02:44] <raster> nvidia, nouveau, amd, radeon, intel etc. 
[02:02:52] <bougyman> nvidia isn't linux compatible?
[02:03:07] <raster> as for the wm i use - mine of course. enlightenment :)
[02:03:08] <bougyman> news to me. I run a lot of nvidia rigs on linux.
[02:03:10] <hornetfighter515> nvidia is linux compatible, but they're not nice about it
[02:03:31] <oriba> MrElendig: hmhhh, so I have to wait? Would be nice if such rebuilds could go hand in hand, one invoking the other (or only publishing those packages together?!)

[06:19:46] <cmnky> "solve a problem once, not repeatedly"
[06:20:04] <ectospasm> That's what scripting is all about.
[06:20:12] <cmnky> I'm not scripting

[22:41:40] <TiZ> Hi there. So I've got this weird problem going on with my HDMI monitor with my Nvidia Optimus laptop. In both the on-demand mode and the Nvidia PrimaryGPU mode, whenever I run a fullscreen game on it, it's just completely black. If I bring up XFCE's task switcher, the game is visible while it's up. But if it's the only thing on-screen, it's just
[22:41:41] <TiZ> black. Has anyone heard of this happening?
