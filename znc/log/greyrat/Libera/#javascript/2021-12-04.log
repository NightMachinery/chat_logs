[00:11:21] <trafficjam> ah ok sweet, i'll give that a try, thanks!
[00:11:24] <qswz> import*
[00:12:11] <ThePhilgrim> I'm just going to start on a new project that will contain html/css & vanilla JS. I have the intention to take the opportunity to learn either webpack or docker. What would be the most important of these two to learn?
[00:13:10] <qswz> webpack
[00:13:21] <silly> webpack
[00:13:37] <qswz> 6-pack
[00:14:01] <qswz> I unlearned docker
[00:14:12] <ThePhilgrim> Can you guys please elaborate on this? I hear a lot of people saying that Docker is a must, and I haven't heard of webpack since like 2 days ago
[00:14:33] <ThePhilgrim> rather.. I hadn't heard of webpack before 2 days ago
[00:14:34] <qswz> docker is mosly hype
[00:15:05] <qswz> companies often use it to provide the same dev env for all developers (independetly of OS), but that's overkill
[00:15:38] <austincheney> ThePhilgrim, docker is nice for automation IF and ONLY IF the target OS matches the host OS otherwise it wont work.
[00:15:40] <qswz> or they use it to deploy independently of host architectures, overkill again
[00:15:55] <austincheney> if you need to do cross-os development or testing docker is out
[00:16:03] <trafficjam> qswz: works perfectly bro, thank you so much. Now just gonna read up on how to allow all domains to access the api and i'm done ;)
[00:16:11] <qswz> trafficjam: yw
[00:16:23] <ThePhilgrim> But did I misunderstand that you can also use Docker as a test environment with both back/front end without actually having a server/hosting
[00:16:24] <ThePhilgrim> ?
[00:17:01] <austincheney> ThePhilgrim, docker is a portable slice of an OS.  That's really all it is.  Because it is a thin slice it is convenient for transport and fast to open
[00:17:32] <austincheney> ThePhilgrim, consider like a VM but smaller and faster with the same user experience
[00:17:35] <qswz> well, it can use a bunch of memory
[00:17:42] <ThePhilgrim> Okay, so I cannot build a full stack app and test it in docker?
[00:17:59] <ThePhilgrim> Rather, it can't do anything that I can do locally without docker?
[00:18:16] <austincheney> ThePhilgrim, the limitation of docker is that must use the same OS as the host machine
[00:18:45] <qswz> it's way slower than a VM like qemu
[00:19:01] <ThePhilgrim> I thought it was made to make your apps work regardless of OS?
[00:19:09] <austincheney> nope
[00:19:23] <qswz> it's one usage
[00:19:26] <austincheney> if you want to run linux on windows, for example, docker wont work.  You will need a full vm
[00:19:35] <ThePhilgrim> Ah, right
[00:19:37] <ThePhilgrim> That makes sense
[00:20:00] <Alexendoo> won't work might be a bit misleading, it'll still work, it just would be running in a vm
[00:20:01] <ThePhilgrim> But what I mean is that if I develop on MacOS through docker, my app will work the same on your machine even if you run windows, no?
[00:20:33] <austincheney> ThePhilgrim, thats up to your app
[00:20:41] <ThePhilgrim> Hmm, okay
[00:21:06] <ThePhilgrim> So for an individual developer, Docker fills no function whatsoever in other words?
[00:21:12] <qswz> off-topic: garlic is best digestive I know
[00:21:19] <qswz> raw ofc
[00:21:42] <qswz> docker is just hype, it's like buying a fancy car
[00:21:52] <austincheney> the need docker fills is the ability to spin up a machine quickly and keep that machine tiny for easy distribution
[00:22:03] <ThePhilgrim> It's also anti-inflammatory – good shit!
[00:22:25] <qswz> yea, it sorts all stuff out in the guts
[00:22:32] <ThePhilgrim> austincheney: Okay
[00:22:39] <Alexendoo> ThePhilgrim: an individual still might like it for the deployment aspect, or for keeping clutter, well, contained
[00:22:49] *** Quits: jetchisel (jetchisel@user/jetchisel) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[00:22:49] <ThePhilgrim> And Webpack – What is it good for?
[00:23:07] <qswz> also webpack and docker are like opposite sides of the spectrum for a dev
[00:23:11] <Alexendoo> It has a dual role, it bundles your application, and frustrates you
[00:23:16] <qswz> but why not
[00:23:22] <ThePhilgrim> Alexendoo: in Python I do virtual envs . That keeps clutter contained. What would be the difference?
[00:23:28] <austincheney> ThePhilgrim, if you are running Linux and you want a database to be running on the same flavor of linux and a webserver on that same flavor of linux you can have a bunch of docker containers ready to go
[00:23:38] <austincheney> its a much lighter footprint than a full VM
[00:23:41] <qswz> you can also learn rollup, a nice bunlder, more for libs
[00:23:50] <Alexendoo> ThePhilgrim: Maybe you need some global clutter, like a particular version of mysql running or something like that
[00:24:01] <Alexendoo> It would be for that sort of thing
[00:24:04] <ThePhilgrim> gswz – Yeah, I'm sure. It's just two concepts I've heard should be learned. So whatever they are, I jsut though a new project would be a good opportunity
[00:24:28] * austincheney runs full VMs so that I can have 4 linux machines running on a windows host
[00:24:52] <ThePhilgrim> But a full VM takes a lot of memory etc right?
[00:25:20] <austincheney> I have 64gb of ram on my computer so I can allocate 8gb to each VM and still have plenty left over
[00:26:03] <ThePhilgrim> Ah, your VMs get as much ram as my whole computer has ;)
[00:26:41] <qswz> it'll take me years to get used to 'main' as branch name
[00:26:54] <ThePhilgrim> I dislike "master" :P
[00:28:02] <d3x0r> my base docker node image is 59M - and you can attach a file-storage container to multiple images for storage - but that's as big as what you save in it
[00:28:35] <d3x0r> smaller than electron :)
[00:28:37] <ThePhilgrim> Anyways, I didn't really understand exactly what Webpack is good for. You guys care to explain?
[00:29:01] <austincheney> it bundles your NPM dependencies into a fat ball
[00:29:19] <d3x0r> reducing dependancyes to DL; just grab one file isntead of a bunch of individual requests
[00:29:45] <d3x0r> resolves node-like paths with searching which a browser->server can't really do

[00:30:46] <ThePhilgrim> Hmm, but with JS, dependencies are usually not installed globally.. so why would I want to have them in a "fat ball"? :D

[00:33:39] <ThePhilgrim> Which means that my shared hosting, that does not support NodeJS, makes it impossible to use webpack on my website?
[00:33:42] <hax> I've got a login that returns a JWT, which the browser stores in localStorage (which I can verify on Application tab of inspector) but for some reason  const rawData = localStorage.getItem("token");  is always empty. The syntax is simple, so I can't figure out what's wrong

[00:34:11] <systemfault> ThePhilgrim: webpack is a "build tool"
[00:34:28] <Alexendoo> You could run webpack before you upload the files to it, but yeah, that kind of shared hosting tends to be painful
[00:34:33] <systemfault> ThePhilgrim: It spits a bundle then you don't need webpack anymore...
[00:35:21] <ThePhilgrim> Ohh, so when I have finished my website, I can run webpack and it gives me something that I can upload to my host?
[00:35:31] <systemfault> Yup.
[00:35:46] <ThePhilgrim> And what does it spit out? A JS script?
[00:36:06] <systemfault> Yeah, it will assemble all the JS files into a single "bundle"
[00:36:31] <Alexendoo> It can emit any number of JS files, or other files as well, depends what you configure it to do
[00:36:37] <ThePhilgrim> Oh okay. So basically, webpack is just something that I use once per project, basically when the project is finished?
[00:36:54] <systemfault> ThePhilgrim: Also while developing... in watch mode
[00:37:01] <ThePhilgrim> Which means?
[00:37:24] <hax> webpack is often used for the whole dev process, not just the final build
[00:37:30] <systemfault> ThePhilgrim: If you change a file and save in your editor, it will recompile the bundle so that if you refresh your browser, you can see the changes.
[00:37:56] <ThePhilgrim> Ah okay, but what good is this bundle while you develop?
[00:38:13] <ThePhilgrim> Why not just create the bundle when you're ready to publish?
[00:38:17] <systemfault> Well, the browser needs to load the JS from somewhere even if you develop.
[00:38:25] <ThePhilgrim> Ah, so just for speed?
[00:38:28] *** Joins: noarb (~noarb@user/noarb)
[00:38:31] <systemfault> no...
[00:38:58] <systemfault> ThePhilgrim: You don't understand the point... the point is being able to split a big application into multiple files, like in any other programming language.
[00:39:16] <ThePhilgrim> right
[00:39:47] <ThePhilgrim> I still haven't worked on any big projects, so I guess lack of experience makes me miss the point :)
[00:39:48] <systemfault> So you have add.js with export function add(a, b) { return a + b } then main.js with import { add } from './add'; console.log(add(2, 3));
[00:39:59] <ThePhilgrim> Right
[00:40:41] <ThePhilgrim> And then webpack smashes that into one script?

[00:42:57] <qswz> yea
[00:43:12] <ThePhilgrim> Okay, I think I'm starting to get it
[00:43:50] <Alexendoo> Also since your app points to <script src="whatever-bundle.js">, you need to run webpack in development to have changes in your source .js reflected on the page
[00:44:05] <ThePhilgrim> Ah, okay
[00:44:18] <ThePhilgrim> Can PHP files be included in webpack?
[00:44:22] <ThePhilgrim> or is it only for js?
[00:44:55] <qswz> nope
[00:45:15] <qswz> it has plenty 'loaders' for html, css, files, ..
[00:45:32] <qswz> fonts, svg, workers, all kind of shit
[00:45:35] <Alexendoo> It's only really for stuff that ends up being sent to the browser

[00:56:21] <ThePendulum> yes
[00:56:24] <ThePhilgrim> Okay
[00:56:38] <ThePhilgrim> So if we're talking about a really small personal project
[00:56:42] <ThePendulum> sass will be part of your build step like react, babel, whatever else you may have

[00:56:59] <ThePhilgrim> You write the scss file and the html file

[00:58:37] <Alexendoo> trafficjam: You could bundle the css as well if you like, or have separate files, up to you
[00:58:40] <ThePendulum> in a professional environment you generally have a dedicated service/server that builds all your code, tests it, and deploys if it passes the tests
[00:58:59] <ThePendulum> for smaller projects I build on the server, but either works really
[00:59:40] <ThePendulum> for sass it doesn't really matter because the output is universal
[01:00:30] *** Joins: jetchisel (~jetchisel@user/jetchisel)
[01:00:33] <ThePendulum> but some things need to be compiled for one specific machine, hence I default to running it on that machine
[01:01:01] <ThePhilgrim> It feels like we're talking about two different things :D
[01:01:22] <ThePhilgrim> Probably because of my lack of understanding of the subject. But still
[01:01:54] <trafficjam> Alexendoo: hmm not really sure what options i have, like this is the component framework i'm using (https://chakra-ui.com/) but i'm not sure how to extract the styles from a component and include them in a renderToStaticMarkup call
[01:02:20] <ThePendulum> for a small project you probably pull your repo straight from git onto the server, and you may not want all your build output on the repo, so you would build it on the server
[01:02:52] <ThePendulum> but there's nothing stopping you from building sass to css on your own machine and pushing that to your server
[01:04:15] <trafficjam> or do i have no choice but to build the component without using chakra, in order to be able to include styles?
[01:04:21] <ThePendulum> as the project grows you may have server-specific configuration files that need to be included in the build
[01:04:25] <ThePhilgrim> ThePendulum: Take it down to kindergarden level – If I pay for shared hosting at hostinger.com, I write 15 lines of html, and then I style it in a .scss file. Now I'm ready to publish. I upload the html file. Now – do I upload the .scss file to hostinger and it applies on the html? Or do I need to compile the scss to css and then upload the css file for it to work?
[01:04:42] <Alexendoo> trafficjam: Oh chakra is css-in-js already, does it not work currently?
[01:05:16] <ThePendulum> ThePhilgrim: if it's shared hosting you'll have to build the css on your machine, if it's a vps or a dedicated server where you can actually run your compilers, you would probably run them on the server
[01:05:25] <PenguinMan98> Now – do I upload the .scss file to hostinger and it applies on the html? No. This will result in errors. Malformatted css. The host will not convert scss to css for you.
[01:05:36] <ThePendulum> you can't just include the scss itself
[01:05:36] <trafficjam> Alexendoo: hmm not 100% sure, but from this thread i don't think so -> https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui/discussions/3435

[01:06:26] <Alexendoo> styled-components is a different library
[01:06:36] <PenguinMan98> It's powerful, but don't bet the farm on it. In the end CSS is still just CSS.
[01:06:45] <PenguinMan98> I do like mixins though

[01:06:59] <ThePendulum> ThePhilgrim: how are you getting scss to work on your local machine then?
[01:07:11] <ThePendulum> it doesn't really do anything until you install sass and build it into css
[01:07:14] <trafficjam> Alexendoo: hmm not really familiar with these underlying libraries (likes emotion, styled-components, etc), but does that mean i can "extract" the styles somehow then?
[01:07:27] <ThePhilgrim> Right, I know about "sass blah.scss blah.css"
[01:07:33] <ThePendulum> right

[01:07:50] <Alexendoo> trafficjam: I'm not that familiar with them. You might be able to, but that's separate from whether it works or not
[01:07:52] <ThePhilgrim> And I didn't understand when you were talking about different cases
[01:07:54] <ThePendulum> not with your typical shared hosting where you just have file access
[01:07:57] <PenguinMan98> It can if you have root access to install scripts
[01:08:15] <ThePhilgrim> Right, my knowledge ends with shared hosting :D
[01:08:19] <PenguinMan98> I got a VPS for exactly that reason
[01:08:27] <PenguinMan98> Even though I don't do anything with it currently
[01:08:37] <ThePendulum> yeah I missed the shared hosting part and assumed you had a full linux install available on your server
[01:08:49] <ThePhilgrim> Okay, so a VPS is like your own slice of server where you can do "whatever you want" ?
[01:08:55] <PenguinMan98> I wanted to run a websocket server on it, yes.
[01:09:15] <ThePhilgrim> ThePendulum: :)

[01:10:19] <trafficjam> Alexendoo: just to clarify, with chakra normally the different component classes are transpiled to app.css i think, but i'm using `renderToString` in  next.js api route, so none of the transpiled classes for my component is included

[01:11:26] <Alexendoo> Oh next.js, that's probably doing the extraction on your behalf

[01:11:38] <trafficjam> Alexendoo: yeah could be, not totally sure
[01:11:45] <ThePendulum> ThePhilgrim: yeah, a VPS pretty much acts like a full remote server/PC

[01:12:06] <trafficjam> which i think had that stuff set up by default
[01:12:09] <Alexendoo> Though if you've got next.js why would you need to manually renderToString?
[01:12:47] <PenguinMan98> I really should update my vps

[06:57:45] <wroathe> So I'm trying to figure out if there's a simple build tool that would let me avoid the need for subjecting myself to the hell that is Webpack that fits my use case: I've got a simple SPA with some stylesheet <link>s in the head, and a <script type="module"> in the body. I want a tool that will take that index.html file as input, and output a single HTML file with the stylesheets and a concatenation of
[06:57:51] <wroathe> all of the loaded modules embedded as <style> and <script> elements in the output HTML
[06:58:05] <wroathe> Basically trying to package up a SPA using native ES6 modules into a single HTML file
[06:58:18] <wroathe> Any recommendations would be appreciated

[07:01:02] <wroathe> I'm sure there's a way I can make Webpack fit this use case, but not without some difficulty. The typical scenario for webpack is that it takes an index.js file as input that as imports for the rest fo application assets, and then outputs a single javascript file as output. Most people then use that in concern with HtmlWebpackPlugin, which generates an HTML file that references that built bundle.
[07:01:08] <wroathe> Thing is, I explicitly want to start with the HTML file as the input, and generate my bundled HTML file as output.
[07:01:26] <wroathe> The whole "entry" and "output" concept
[07:02:07] *** Quits: Rockwood (~Rocky@user/rocky) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[07:02:16] <wroathe> For simple enough SPAs I like the idea of just having a static HTML file in the repository that references native ES6 modules, where you just use something simple like http-server to serve the application during development
[07:02:34] <wroathe> Rather than requiring all of the machinery behind something like webpack-dev-server and all of the loaders and whatnot
[07:03:12] <wroathe> I.e. a "no build" application for development
[07:03:39] <wroathe> Where the build is just reserved for building a single HTML file for distribution to others that might have access to the repo, or for deployment to a server somewhere
[07:05:03] <velix> okay, since nobody wants my money, I need to do it on my own.
[07:05:22] <wroathe> This is a recurring theme with you

[08:40:13] <pavonia> Probably the number of nodes in the tree
[08:41:29] <peterhil> cthulchu: Totally! One practical example is seen in OmniGraffle mac applicatoin, where you cant set cardinality to groups of nodes for automatic placement of the graphs. Very cool and useful!
[08:42:08] <cthulchu> perfect. I just wasn't sure if it would apply to trees as well as it applies to sets. Many thanks
[08:43:55] <peterhil> In a bit different way – I made a weighted trie some years ago. From it you can get probabilities of different prefixes. So each node holds the weight that is the number of leaves stored below that node.

[10:17:31] <peterhil> silly: Netbooks are certainly handy in size. But even comparing this Thinkpad keyboard to the previous Dell laptop feels totally much better. I kind of like the Acer AspireOne keyboard, but it's too flat.
[10:17:34] <paulcarroty> @peterhil so replace the keyboard and get some extra keys for repair from the old one.

[14:14:33] <jwpapi> Is this a proper way to set up an object, or should I write isolated helper functions like `.sumOfArrary()` outside the object? Because afterwards I’m only using `.profit()` and `.spend()` https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/qHCP2tz1/
[14:15:46] <jwpapi> There was a mistake in the first code https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/WLqqLvc9/
[14:21:35] <hax> jwpapi, yeah that looks fine. It's not the usual syntax though. putting the export with references at the bottom makes it easier to see all of them at once
[14:22:10] <tmm88> jwpapi: are you trying to build a bot for trading crypto?
[14:22:13] <hax> it's short tho so meh

[14:23:16] <tmm88> https://vimeo.com/manage/videos/648585511
[14:24:01] <jwpapi> hax: I could make all the ones that I’m not gonna use as private methods or? To make it clear what I’m planning to use
[14:24:37] <hax> yeah, exactly. I don't know what you're doing so it's hard to say
[14:27:03] <jwpapi> It’s a couple of API calls that I have done and then it takes those API responses does the calculations and generates me the format I want
[14:27:49] <jwpapi> Ahh I’m stupid!
[14:28:03] <jwpapi> I should have returned only the 2 functions I need
[14:28:21] <jwpapi> And I can return them as properties not methods
[14:28:57] <jwpapi> That makes it clear
[14:30:08] <jwpapi> So `generateReport()` is a straight forward factory function which takes API data and returns an object with properties needed later

[20:40:54] <podeni> Hi everyone. I'm managing a legacy PHP app with an in-house MVC framework (largely inspired by Symfony) and twig templates. If I wanted to add React to certain pages, how spagetti would ot get? Would I need to transpile the code for each page differently (as each page is its own entry point into a distinct app)?
[20:41:05] <podeni> it*
[20:41:37] <stenno> inspired by symfony 4?
[20:41:50] <stenno> react is easy with symfony 4+
[20:42:07] <podeni> TBH I don't know. How would Symfony 4+ do it?

[20:45:48] <trafficjam> do people still use php?
[20:47:21] <deniska> podeni: at the end of the day react is a library which you point to work on some DOM element in a browser
[20:47:24] <podeni> I see the solution depends on a Symfony plugin called Webpack Encore that makes it easy to integrate webpack into the app. Looks very handy.
[20:48:57] <deniska> podeni: now "how'd you develop a typical react application inside a typical server side rendering framework?" is the whole another issue, and the last time I looked, I didn't like much what other people were doing

[22:29:43] <chazy> so i have a timer/countdown in vanilla using setInterval() and i need to do something every 6 minutes since the beginning of the timer until the end, is there a way that doesn't involve a bunch of ifs inside the setInterval()? or is that the only way?
[22:29:54] <ThePhilgrim> Right, I know about the event.. I started by trying to do const blah = document.my-form.foo; but that didn't seem to work
[22:30:26] <ThePhilgrim> Because when I then added blah.addEventListener('click', () => {...}) I get an error in the console saying it's not a function
