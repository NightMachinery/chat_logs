[00:27:19] <Cecen> Is there any way to hint that a branch is unreachable at runtime?
[00:27:52] <irwiss> #if FALSE
[00:28:07] <jonp> yes: an expression which is `const` or `readonly`, i believe

[00:29:23] <Cecen> That would be at compile time, in this case it's a condition that will always evaluate to the same thing, but whether that's true or false isn't known until executing some logic for the first time

[01:52:53] <merced> Cecen: short answer is no, long answer is it depends
[01:53:19] <merced> the JIT is pretty good in recent years unless you're stuck on an earlier .NET
[01:53:32] <merced> check out .NET 6 tree-shaking/pruning
[02:07:56] <Suchiman> Cecen: if you're on .NET Core and you put that boolean into a readonly static bool variable before the methods, where you want to have that check in optimized, JIT compiled, then the JIT will recognize that readonly static bool as constant and trim unreachable branches based no that

[03:22:51] <GunArm> long shot I'll probably ask again on monday but:  Anyone run into issues with .net https requests specifically in combination with apache servers and proxied links, specifically only on apache versions within the alst couple years?
[03:25:06] <GunArm> the problem is that apache times out trying to start proxied worker threads.  even worker threads that do nothing, just stubs.  it won't happen if apache is more than 2 years old, if you use an http client that is not dotnet based, if you are not using https, or if the content at the request is static instead of proxied
[03:25:57] <GunArm> so with new apache, https, proxied link:  dotnet https requests fail, but requests made by a perl client work
[03:26:25] <GunArm> with dotnet client, https, proxied link: older than 2 years apache works
[03:26:55] <GunArm> dotnet, https, modern apache: static links work but proxied ones don't
[03:27:12] <GunArm> dotnet client, modern apache, proxied link: http works https doesnt
[03:27:35] <GunArm> perfect alignment of: modern apache, dotnet client, https, proxied link: fails

[05:10:24] <pitfall> brianonymous yea, I have been impressed too, but: https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/pull/775
[05:10:24] <brianonymous> well, byte* -> span
[05:11:08] <cloudbender> Goal : consume JSON into a DataGridView
[05:11:18] <pitfall> so far, a lot of the byte* -> Span<byte> stuff has been faster or about the same (see the QEncoder perf comparison as another example of this)

[05:11:40] <cloudbender> Right now I'm raw parsing and it's to hideous to print

[07:01:59] <JakeSays> brianonymous: you think putin is really going to invade ukraine?
[07:02:24] <cloudbender> well, The Crimea hs been a grey area for quite some time
[07:03:00] <cloudbender> The argument is that the region of eastern ukraine is somprised mainly of Russians.
[07:03:18] <brianonymous> he did with crimea.. i think his intent might have been to threaten.. but i dont understand why hed put 75% of his ground forces on the border unless he intended to follow through. thats pretty expensive, in an economy only 15% the size of the next super powers
[07:03:37] <JakeSays> brianonymous: exactly
[07:04:02] <cloudbender> It boils down to trade, and costs of trade.
[07:04:36] <cloudbender> Which is silly, since it would cost him less to just get along.
[07:05:02] <brianonymous> if i put on my russia glasses, i could also understand why i wouldnt want a giant nato base next door
[07:05:13] <JakeSays> it's not about trade. it's about nato
[07:05:19] <JakeSays> brianonymous: indeed
[07:05:44] <JakeSays> but then if you have no intention of rebuilding the ussr then a giant nato base shouldn't matter
[07:06:37] <cloudbender> Nato is not Russia's biggest Worry.  Europe would rather trade with Russia versus warring with Russia.
[07:06:56] <brianonymous> but i think thats ust cuz the west has the economy that it does
[07:07:12] <brianonymous> even if its teetering right now
[07:07:18] <cloudbender> Life in the Far North is Hard, Cold, and Mean
[07:07:34] <cloudbender> And expensive.
[07:07:39] <JakeSays> russia wants it's ussr land back.
[07:08:13] <JakeSays> which it can't get if that land is part of nato
[07:08:42] <brianonymous> yeah, the whole thing feels mainly like a geopolitical chess move than an economic one
[07:08:50] <JakeSays> yup
[07:08:52] <cloudbender> Therein is the problem.  Many nations do not wish to cede their sovereignty
[07:09:03] <cloudbender> Or their cultures.
[07:09:16] <brianonymous> well, thats why i think they got away with crimea
[07:09:34] <cloudbender> Russia needs access to seaports
[07:09:43] <brianonymous> many of them had russian passports
[07:10:51] *** Joins: ejjfunky0 (~ejjfunky2@125.164.17.4)
[07:10:56] <JakeSays> the sevastopol naval base is a huge strategic base
[07:11:17] <JakeSays> that's why putin wanted it
[07:11:19] <brianonymous> "According to the census result the population of the Crimean Federal District is 2.2844 million people. The ethnic composition is as follows: Russians: 1.49 million (65.3%), Ukrainians: 0.35 million (15.1%), Crimean Tatars: 0.24 million (12.0%)."
[07:11:23] <JakeSays> everything else is a pretext
[07:11:46] <cloudbender> The task is to somehow get resources to Russia at a bit of a loss to the rest of the markets.
[07:12:58] <JakeSays> brianonymous: that should've been settled in '91
[07:13:23] <brianonymous> i dont think they had the resources to negotiate it
[07:13:38] <JakeSays> they still dont, which is why they took it
[07:14:29] <brianonymous> i think if they do take it by force, energy prices are gonna go stupid, cuz that gonna be the western response..
[07:15:01] <JakeSays> take ukraine?
[07:15:03] <brianonymous> if the response is purely economic, it seems like the best way to smack them is their energy exports
[07:15:06] <brianonymous> yeah
[07:15:17] <brianonymous> and thats gonna push them to china ->
[07:15:31] <cloudbender> We can't smack their exports, Europe needs them.
[07:15:32] <ejjfunky> first, ex russian countries. next europe.
[07:15:47] <brianonymous> cloudbender: they do, but the US im sure will do dumb shit and intervene
[07:16:00] <cloudbender> Hard to say.
[07:16:02] <JakeSays> if they do invade then nato had better step up
[07:16:07] <brianonymous> Biden is quote as saying he will shut down nord
[07:16:43] <brianonymous> https://www.politico.com/news/2022/02/07/biden-warns-americans-leave-ukraine-00006374
[07:16:52] <JakeSays> yup
[07:17:29] <brianonymous> its a great tactic to hurt them, but it will hurt everyone else too
[07:17:54] <JakeSays> short term, yes
[07:17:59] <cloudbender> Again, Russia should join Nato and put a rest to it's conquest mentality.  Things can be worked out.
[07:18:14] <brianonymous> i think putin knows this at well. i dunno if the west is in the greatest economic shape to be playing those kinda games right now
[07:18:21] <brianonymous> and i cant type
[07:18:26] <JakeSays> cloudbender: i agree, but that's not what putin ants
[07:18:46] <cloudbender> Putin is Hamstrung by history.
[07:18:57] <brianonymous> we all are
[07:19:02] <cloudbender> yeah
[07:19:04] <JakeSays> brianonymous: the only thing russia has is energy.
[07:19:11] <brianonymous> which is quite important
[07:19:15] <cloudbender> And Minerals
[07:19:24] <cloudbender> Lots and Lots of Minerals
[07:19:26] <JakeSays> his gas is just convenient - it's not necessary
[07:19:54] <cloudbender> Piping energy from Russia is far better than hauling it over the water in ships.
[07:20:06] <brianonymous> it would cause a release of a lot of western strategic reserves for a little while.. which will jack up the barrels of black goo
[07:20:23] <JakeSays> cloudbender: better yes, but not necessary
[07:20:25] <brianonymous> in a time where our supply chains are already shakey at best
[07:20:38] <brianonymous> in terms of putins move, id say its amazing timing
[07:20:48] <cloudbender> ^^^
[07:21:00] <ejjfunky> Russian energy is like vodka. Tasteless but addictive.
[07:21:05] <cloudbender> Starting to smell fishy me says
[07:21:45] <brianonymous> ejjfunky: lol
[07:22:01] <JakeSays> ejjfunky: so are their women
[07:22:05] <ejjfunky> What the European countries need is just get over the cold turkeys.
[07:22:19] <brianonymous> and then you got the whole thing where, if russia does make kinetic moves, whats china gonna do?
[07:22:38] <JakeSays> brianonymous: honestly i dont think they'll do much
[07:22:51] <brianonymous> as long as they dont smell too much of an oppurtunity
[07:23:01] <ejjfunky> brianonymous, china wants Taiwan and the South China sea.
[07:23:09] <brianonymous> ejjfunky: exactly
[07:23:09] <ejjfunky> both countries have a drive to conquer.
[07:23:47] <cloudbender> China has immense internal pressures.  Russia is just effing misrable, cold, and mal-nourished.
[07:23:55] <brianonymous> and i suspect that could be the wwiii scenareo, if china goes active in parallel.. otherwise, its just an economic meg
[07:23:58] <brianonymous> meg=meh
[07:24:42] <JakeSays> brianonymous: ah so you think china could start its own thing - i thought you meant what would china do to help russia
[07:24:53] <ejjfunky> cloudbender, only the commoners. the fat politicians are cozy there.
[07:25:12] <brianonymous> JakeSays: yeah, if we spread thin and focus.. and then china is like 'yo taiwan, SUP BROS'
[07:25:40] <JakeSays> right
[07:25:42] <ejjfunky> cloudbender, the irony is I see this happening in the most democratic country in the world, US as well.
[07:25:43] <JakeSays> makes sense
[07:25:54] <cloudbender> Russia should join Nato
[07:26:06] <JakeSays> cloudbender: lol yes you've mentioned
[07:26:16] <brianonymous> i mean, if i was an evil superpower, what a time to strike with the west as it is right now
[07:26:17] <ejjfunky> the poor is getting poorer while the richer is getting richer. Capitalism or Communism doesn't matter.
[07:26:49] <brianonymous> ejjfunky: nobody understands that the root of all problems are people themselves
[07:27:01] <brianonymous> human nature
[07:27:12] <JakeSays> brianonymous: personally i don't think we'd really do much if china took taiwan
[07:27:17] <brianonymous> every system trends toward dysfunction
[07:27:42] <brianonymous> JakeSays: maybe not.. but it does make the west look weak after all the blabber
[07:28:01] <cloudbender> The Russian People aren't evil.  They are cold, hungry, and see few opportunities, and no effing sunshine.
[07:28:02] <ejjfunky> JakeSays, Taiwan is smart. They made themselves indispensable.
[07:28:19] <JakeSays> brianonymous: indeed
[07:28:29] <ejjfunky> the US will come and defend Taiwan.
[07:28:31] <JakeSays> ejjfunky: that wouldn't change under china
[07:28:40] <brianonymous> cloudbender: all people are capable of evil.. yes many are not evil. but those who want power seem to have tendancies
[07:29:04] <ejjfunky> JakeSays, just like Hong Kong. Hong Kong wasn't what it used to be.
[07:29:08] <cloudbender> well, yeah
[07:29:29] <cloudbender> coding music
[07:29:31] <cloudbender> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNi7KP4K2c0
[07:29:36] <JakeSays> ejjfunky: i dont think HK as it is now has affected the world economy much
[07:29:36] <brianonymous> i think its why communism always ends up in a mass murder situation, lol..
[07:30:16] <ejjfunky> JakeSays, it used to be a major financial hub in the world
[07:30:21] <cloudbender> Actually, communism begins with thos mass murders.
[07:30:28] <ejjfunky> comparable to japan at that time.
[07:30:40] <brianonymous> in order to function effectively as a hive society, all people must be in sync.. but that goes against human nature.. so then the attempt is to just eliminate the differences. by force.
[07:30:46] <ejjfunky> i would argue, before returning to Japan to even be bigger than Japan.
[07:30:58] <ejjfunky> returning to China*
[07:31:05] <JakeSays> ejjfunky: right, but that hasn't affected the world economy
[07:31:49] <JakeSays> china has a market economy.
[07:31:55] <brianonymous> ish
[07:32:07] <brianonymous> some kinda weird ass hybrid model
[07:32:15] <cloudbender> OK so tonight it's Rice, or Noodles.  So hard to decide.
[07:32:25] <brianonymous> what kind of noodles
[07:32:40] <ejjfunky> JakeSays, Hong Kong returned to China in 1997. One of the biggest financial crisis was in 1997. Coincidence? I don't think so.
[07:32:46] <cloudbender> Fusilli with garlic and oil
[07:33:11] <brianonymous> id go with that
[07:33:14] <cloudbender> yeah, sounds good
[07:33:29] <cloudbender> maybe a bit of onion
[07:33:34] <JakeSays> ejjfunky: i dont recall a financial crisis in '97
[07:33:56] <ejjfunky> JakeSays, if you could say that, maybe you werent born yet?
[07:34:06] <JakeSays> ejjfunky: i'm 54
[07:34:22] <ejjfunky> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_Asian_financial_crisis
[07:34:22] <brianonymous> you talk the dotcom bubble?
[07:34:31] <cloudbender> the 97 recession was artificially tempered by the tech boom.
[07:34:38] <ejjfunky> no, dotcom is after.
[07:34:53] <JakeSays> ahh it was in asia.
[07:35:01] <brianonymous> i feel like i kind of remember that
[07:35:11] <JakeSays> yeah from the news
[07:35:15] <brianonymous> i didnt start paying attention to shit til 2001
[07:35:22] <JakeSays> brianonymous: exactly
[07:35:48] <JakeSays> ejjfunky: yeah that may have been related to HK, but again it wasn't a world wide issue
[07:35:52] <ejjfunky> JakeSays: look at countries affected, not just Asian only.
[07:36:27] <ejjfunky> JakeSays: Also look at the section "Outside Asia"
[07:37:01] <ejjfunky> JakeSays: That tied nicely to: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_Russian_financial_crisis
[07:37:28] <ejjfunky> it's like a house of cards. when one part fails, the others follow.
[07:37:42] <brianonymous> we shifted MAD to economic terms
[07:37:43] <JakeSays> huh. well, i was knee deep in the tech bubble so things were pretty good at the time.
[07:38:03] <ejjfunky> JackSays: An another one: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998%E2%80%932002_Argentine_great_depression
[07:38:18] <brianonymous> i turned 21 in 97, i was busy :D
[07:38:27] <JakeSays> fucking punk
[07:38:43] <ejjfunky> JakeSays: It started in Asia but it was a global event.
[07:39:11] <JakeSays> ejjfunky: it wasn't global.
[07:39:54] <JakeSays> looks like it was limited to asian and 2nd world countries
[07:40:57] <ejjfunky> JakeSays: Read this article, also the title that says, "Global": https://www.thebalance.com/what-caused-2008-global-financial-crisis-3306176
[07:41:34] <JakeSays> the 2008 crisis was caused by clinton
[07:41:49] <JakeSays> and men suck at grocery shopping
[07:41:55] <cloudbender> lol
[07:41:58] <brianonymous> no way, im excellent at it
[07:42:18] <brianonymous> my wife can spend like 3 hrs doing that shit
[07:42:28] <brianonymous> i can knock it out in 25mins
[07:42:37] <JakeSays> i order the same things from instacart each week. the women shoppers are in and out fast - super efficient. they men take forever
[07:42:58] <ejjfunky> JakeSays: Anyway, it seems that you don't understand the financial market so it seems pointless to keep giving you facts.
[07:43:10] <brianonymous> i forget what you guys are arguing about
[07:43:19] <JakeSays> brianonymous: me too
[07:44:15] <JakeSays> ejjfunky: it's not that i don't understand - it's that right now i don't give a shit.
[07:44:39] <ejjfunky> ok JakeSays.
[07:44:51] <ejjfunky> frankly, I don't a shit either.
[07:44:58] <JakeSays> you keep pasting urls that i don't want to read
[07:45:17] <ejjfunky> Ok Jake. You're right.
[07:45:22] <brianonymous> and im being honest when i say i dont remember how we got here
[07:45:41] <JakeSays> brianonymous: you drove.
[07:45:49] <ejjfunky> brianonymous, me neither. let's choose another topic.
[07:46:16] <JakeSays> i had a ticket to kiev departing tomorrow morning
[07:46:23] <brianonymous> OH THAT REMINDS ME
[07:46:27] <JakeSays> LOL
[07:46:45] <brianonymous> McCartney is coming to baltimore in June, and im telling you right now, i will attend at any cost
[07:46:49] <ejjfunky> JakeSays, not a good time to be in Ukraine.
[07:46:58] <DoofusCanadensis> I don't think the ticket was for him
[07:47:05] <JakeSays> DoofusCanadensis: it was
[07:47:13] <JakeSays> ejjfunky: indeed
[07:47:19] <JakeSays> brianonymous: why?
[07:47:23] <brianonymous> JakeSays: why what
[07:47:25] <JakeSays> oh the beetle
[07:47:32] <brianonymous> Got Back tour
[07:47:47] <JakeSays> brianonymous: man, i saw him a few years ago. was an EXCELLENT concert
[07:47:59] <brianonymous> i dont think that homie has much time left, and if i die without seeing a live beatle, i will forever regret it
[07:48:06] <brianonymous> so im not holding back. i signed up for presale
[07:48:07] <JakeSays> indeed
[07:48:33] <JakeSays> i've been to a lot of geriatric concerts and his was by far the best
[07:48:54] <brianonymous> no doubt about it in my mind
[07:49:10] <brianonymous> and im betting its gonna be like Get Back
[07:49:18] <JakeSays> brianonymous: just be prepared to feel real old as the audience will be ancient
[07:49:26] <brianonymous> im probably going to bring my dad
[07:49:35] <JakeSays> that'd be cool
[07:49:55] *** Quits: DoofusCanadensis (~DoofusCan@2604:3d09:47c:f970:5ab:ece6:8b16:abf0) (Quit: So as you can see from this flowchSQUIRREL!!)
[07:50:14] <brianonymous> going to try and get as close as possible
[07:50:43] <JakeSays> we were about 30 feet from the stage
[07:51:01] <brianonymous> thats where i want to be.. if i can get on ticketmaster fast enough
[07:51:02] <ejjfunky0> brianonymous, with covid like this, i dont think it's advisable to go toncerts.
[07:51:13] <JakeSays> bah
[07:51:22] <JakeSays> just get all the shots
[07:51:55] <brianonymous> maryland just shutdown all its doodads. i cant say im very concerned. somehow i managed to avoid it, even when it was in my house
[07:52:21] <JakeSays> shutdown its what?
[07:52:26] <ejjfunky0> oh well, everyone got their choices. but just be aware of the risks. and when you're in the hospital, finding yourself drowning and hard to breathe, just remember, it was your choice.
[07:52:27] <brianonymous> its mandates n shit
[07:52:30] <JakeSays> ah
[07:52:35] <brianonymous> my kids last day of masks in school was thursday
[07:52:57] <brianonymous> ejjfunky0: cant tell if satire or..?
[07:53:29] <ejjfunky0> brianonymous, anyway, i've seen the worst of it, so, seeing is believing?
[07:53:30] <JakeSays> will a full set of shots the  risk of hospitalization is super low
[07:53:54] <JakeSays> brianonymous: you gonna vaccinate your kids?
[07:54:21] <brianonymous> they are.. my son had to wait because he got rona first and had to wait
[07:54:33] <brianonymous> i think it was 90 days or something
[07:54:39] <JakeSays> ah that's right
[07:54:50] <brianonymous> my daughter couldnt until she turned 11
[07:54:59] <brianonymous> er 12?
[07:55:04] <brianonymous> i dunno, feels like 10 years ago
[07:55:32] <JakeSays> ah so that was before they lowered it to 5

[07:56:26] <ejjfunky0> brianonymous: children are so resilient. only taste buds is extremely minor.
[07:56:29] <JakeSays> that's all gone now?
[07:56:33] <brianonymous> yeah
[07:57:03] <ejjfunky0> brianonymous: is he less choosy now with food?
[07:57:10] <brianonymous> ejjfunky0: well, i mean, if just go by the numbers themselves, the majority are in the minor case folders
[07:57:48] <brianonymous> somehow, everyone i know got it, except for me
[07:58:13] <ejjfunky0> brianonymous: chances are, you got a minor one and you didn't know it.
[07:58:19] <brianonymous> likely
[07:58:35] <ejjfunky0> that cough, that headache. maybe that little fever.
[07:58:46] <ejjfunky0> could be some of the symptoms.
[07:59:41] <brianonymous> i thought for sure i would get the optimus prime variant when i went out west a few weeks ago
[08:00:08] <ejjfunky0> brianonymous, haha. optimus prime. :D but glad you didnt
[08:00:52] <ejjfunky0> btw, are you guys programmers, if i may ask?
[08:00:56] <brianonymous> thanks, yeah.. with how stupidly contagious it is, it was a shock
[08:01:04] <brianonymous> yeah
[08:01:09] <ejjfunky0> ahh ok.
[08:01:18] <ejjfunky0> Looks like JakeSays, is away.
[08:01:45] <ejjfunky0> brinanonymous, i got a C# interview next week but not too sure what to prepare.
[08:02:00] <brianonymous> we all are
[08:02:10] <brianonymous> no experience in c#?
[08:02:29] <ejjfunky0> Have you ever taken any tests at testdome.com.
[08:02:35] <brianonymous> no
[08:03:07] <ejjfunky0> been using C# for more than a decade. But these 4 years, i had been working on something else.
[08:03:10] <brianonymous> ive started a new thing when interviewing peeps.. i take code from our source base, break it, and have them fix it
[08:04:14] <ejjfunky0> brianonymous, sounds like a good way to do it.
[08:04:44] <brianonymous> its to make sure they would like what they would be doing. we do weird c# stuff
[08:04:59] <ejjfunky0> i think i like to do tests like than to have multiple question time based tests
[08:05:14] <brianonymous> i think many folks with c# are mostly on the business apps/aspnet side of things
[08:05:51] <brianonymous> yeah, we have them pull from a repo, and push the fixes.. kinda covers a lot of bases at once
[08:06:32] <brianonymous> i suck hard at time based quizzing
[08:06:34] <ejjfunky0> brianonymous, i once got a remote job for a UK manufacturing company.
[08:06:58] <ejjfunky0> And, i had to support their system that still runs on ASP Classic with vbscripts. :D
[08:07:05] <brianonymous> oh man
[08:07:11] <ejjfunky0> imagine that.
[08:07:20] <brianonymous> i can.. but only in 2004
[08:07:28] <ejjfunky0> and not only that, missing source codes and javascript that has no structure.
[08:07:53] <ejjfunky0> in short, it was madness.
[08:08:05] <brianonymous> well, you were trapped in legacy rings of hell
[08:08:17] <ejjfunky0> even the senior dev who had been in the company for 16 years couldnt tell where things were.
[08:08:31] <ejjfunky0> brianonymous, exactly.
[08:08:54] <ejjfunky0> in manufacturing, if things aint broken, why fix it.
[08:09:16] <ejjfunky0> so, i've been burnt too many times. if the pay isn't good, i wouldn't take it.
[08:09:26] <ejjfunky0> i mean, "better" this time. good is not enough anymore.
[08:09:45] <brianonymous> its been a weird hiring climate. we havent had much luck
[08:10:17] <ejjfunky0> brianonymous, it's totally like hunting/mining. you just need to hit a jackpot.
[08:10:42] <brianonymous> which hasnt been easy at all
[08:11:07] <ejjfunky0> i was in the dry before this too until i got this one. Currently though, best strategy is still just 'randomly' select a few and apply.
[08:11:35] <brianonymous> it feels like demand is high, at least over here
[08:12:11] <brianonymous> it could be that we are just being too anal about the match
[08:12:11] <ejjfunky0> there was a time when i was applying in the hundreds, and i had to do 5 hard interviews in a week. that was really hectic too. and naturally, i didnt get any just because i didnt prepared well.
[08:13:27] <brianonymous> alrighty, well, i gotta get my ass to bed
[08:13:43] <ejjfunky0> ok, brianonymous, have a good sleep. take care.
[08:13:45] <brianonymous> talk later o/
[08:13:50] <ejjfunky0> sure thing! :)
[08:14:14] <JakeSays> ejjfunky0: i am now un away
[08:14:38] <ejjfunky0> hey JakeSays, welcome back.
[08:17:02] <ejjfunky0> oh. un as in on. lol
[08:18:50] <JakeSays> un as in not
[08:21:50] <JakeSays> so apparently biden has intelligence saying that putin has made the decision to invade
[08:22:42] <JakeSays> and russian backed ukrainian separatists in eastern ukraine are ordering civilians to evacuate
[08:33:47] <ejjfunky0> JakeSays, it's all Putin's chess game.
[08:34:15] <ejjfunky0> I didn't realized it until i googled it again as to when Russia left G8
[08:34:29] <ejjfunky0> i think the plan had already been done since then.
[08:34:52] <ejjfunky0> or at least, the decision had been made then.

[20:53:22] <ap5> Is Brave a good browser? Better than Firefox?
[20:53:43] <MichaelLong> probably not
[20:54:15] <ap5> I have this feeling ... they shut every ad out, so they can hand over their own
[20:55:33] <ap5> and Opera is owned by China (almost). Firefox seems like the best choice
[20:55:48] <MichaelLong> I've read some articles over the time, and there was alaways something fishy. so why would I use this over any open source browsers like firefox or chromium
[20:56:28] <MichaelLong> I'm still using firefox as main browser (althrough I had serious problems with it a couple of versions ago) and vivaldi as second
[20:57:23] <ap5> Vivaldi is ... not pretty on mobile, i think. I only run Firefox, but it feels ... slow
[20:57:59] <MichaelLong> ap5, on mobile? I don't know. I'm only browsing on mobile in emergency situations
[20:59:09] <ap5> ok :)
[20:59:31] <ap5> I do a lot of browsing on mobile
[20:59:45] <MichaelLong> and I'm on a system were it does not really makes sense to use any non-stock "browser"
[21:00:32] <bomb> NOTHING is better than Firefox
[21:01:00] <bomb> MichaelLong IceWeasel? Konqueror? SeaMonkey?
[21:01:12] <ap5> I will stick to Firefox. Deep inside i am feeling that i am betraying the web when using another browser
