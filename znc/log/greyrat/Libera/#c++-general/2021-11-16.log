[00:01:24] <cbreak> InPhase: well, problem here is for example sharing memory of libraries like SSH
[00:02:12] <cbreak> or sudo
[00:02:54] <InPhase> cbreak: Yes, presumably mission critical software would require the same protections.
[00:05:10] <InPhase> Properly, yes, these should be under hardware responsibility.  It just sounds like there are also opportunities to layer in OS and memory library safeguards, analogous to safeguards like address space layout randomization.  It's a brave new world.
[00:06:02] <cbreak> what you'd need to do isn't really randomize memory, but avoid sharing memory
[00:06:30] <InPhase> What matters is how the shared memory is used.

[00:12:04] <InPhase> Although on reflection perhaps how most shared memory is used is too far out of control for that to be helpful.

[14:41:48] <TinoDidriksen> Sure, for non-GUI work then std::thread is fine.
[14:42:22] <LordKalma> for gui stuff you must do all gui stuff on the main thread
[14:42:41] <LordKalma> but you can have other event loops for other stuff

[16:37:45] <PJBoy> ok I'm really confused
[16:37:55] <PJBoy> the C/C++ VS Code extension
[16:38:04] <PJBoy> it has no extension options?
[16:38:15] <PJBoy> clangd managed to disable its intellisense somehow...
[16:39:52] <PJBoy> but the extension page says it has 114 settings
[16:40:47] <PJBoy> they're all prefixed by C_Cpp, but searching for that in the settings yields nothing
[16:44:21] <LordKalma> in the settings UI in the left you can dropdown extensions
[16:44:25] <LordKalma> and find that one
[16:44:51] <LordKalma> the microsoft extension and the clangd one can't lint at the same time
[16:45:04] <LordKalma> they'll mutually disable the linting part of each other
[16:45:17] <LordKalma> you can have the MS extension and use it for other things whilst keeping the clangd one for linting

[16:55:04] <PJBoy> where would it be?

[16:56:57] <PJBoy> oh yeah the VS code explorer knows where .vscode is
[16:57:02] <PJBoy> yaeh just a settings.json
[16:57:29] <LordKalma> when you use the MS extension, specially with intellisense, that file helps
[16:57:37] <LordKalma> for example `"compileCommands": "/path/to/compile_commands.json",`
[16:57:56] <LordKalma> (that one pretty much solves all the others)
[16:59:11] <PJBoy> eh but I don't care about 99% of this extension
[16:59:16] <PJBoy> I just want a debugger
[16:59:29] <LordKalma> for that it'll all generate itself iirc
[16:59:46] <LordKalma> just for you to be aware
[17:00:13] <PJBoy> actually yeah, even this extension would want the compile_commands then
[17:00:20] <PJBoy> to pass to gdb or whatever somehow
[17:00:40] <PJBoy> or for some other shit to do with source mapping
[17:00:51] <PJBoy> although I dunno now

[17:15:38] <LordKalma> PJBoy, cmake already trivializes a lot of this, like https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/CheckIPOSupported.html in combination with https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION.html#variable:CMAKE_INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION
[17:16:23] <PJBoy> that's good
[17:17:01] <PJBoy> so I'm wondering if I even needed the C/C++ extension

[17:17:09] <LordKalma> I think you need for the deebugging yes
[17:17:11] <PJBoy> or if I can just use this launch.json file directly
[17:17:25] <LordKalma> the c++ extension is the debugging provider

[22:54:40] <rpav> auto i = "int x = 42; int y = 1; return x + y;"_eval;
[22:55:09] <rpav> would probably not be terribly hard to implement if you have support for a few compilers

[23:09:23] <LordKalma> that almost looks like boost.lambda2
[23:12:11] <rpav> you could along the same lines skip the user defined literal and have eval(x, y, "return x + y;") but
[23:12:34] <rpav> actually you may have to specify a return type

[23:14:11] <Alipha> rpav: for compile-time strings only, i assume?
[23:17:06] <rpav> Alipha: nah pretty sure if you specify a well-known(/compatible) compiler exists in the runtime environment, you could coerce it to write a dll/so, and load and call the function
[23:17:38] <rpav> i mean that's how i'd do it for the basic implementation, it would pretty much be the same if you had user strings eval'd

[23:18:11] <LordKalma> what is this? javascript?
[23:18:12] <rpav> you would have to specify eval<RETURN_TYPE>(...); of course, you couldn't really specify a user-written _eval_, except in a compiled/loaded string
[23:18:50] <rpav> there may be nicer ways to do it with some compilers, e.g. llvm
[23:21:19] <rpav> of dubious value of course, but i couldn't think of anything more interesting at the moment ;(
