[01:03:08] <GetShwifty1> usb sticks and sd cards are very finnicky
[01:03:38] <GetShwifty1> have a usb stick that never gets used, sits on my monitor stand. gets used for 5 minutes once every few months..
[01:03:59] <merced> lol dont think ive ever had a problem with one
[01:04:03] <GetShwifty1> just randomly started giving windows the 'you can't use this without formatting' which you can cancel and then get to
[01:04:12] <merced> the usb on my keychain has been submerged andd dropped repeatedly andd its still fine
[01:04:26] <GetShwifty1> yeah like i said
[01:04:30] <GetShwifty1> fme it's very finnicky
[01:05:27] <_Shurik_> because they have r/w cycle limit
[01:05:34] <GetShwifty1> lol
[01:05:46] <GetShwifty1> (3:33:54 PM) GetShwifty1: have a usb stick that never gets used, sits on my monitor stand. gets used for 5 minutes once every few months.. <<
[01:06:12] <GetShwifty1> i poromise you that usb stick is at .0000000000000000000000001% of its MTB

[01:06:35] <irwiss> because they're soldered using some shit sticks and animal droppings for solder
[01:06:39] <GetShwifty1> has never been more than 10F + or - outside of room range
[01:07:34] <merced> manufacturing defect
[01:07:36] <merced> or bad port?
[01:07:58] <GetShwifty1> i mean a manufacturing defect that shows itself after 3 years of no movement, no use, ? lol
[01:08:11] <GetShwifty1> and no it is  happening on every single computer it's plugged into
[01:08:11] <blezz>  e
[01:08:17] <GetShwifty1> that's literally why i used the term 'finnicky' lol
[01:08:20] <blezz> e
[01:08:26] <GetShwifty1> because there is 0 valid explanation  for it
[01:08:43] <merced> ye
[01:08:50] <merced> defective
[01:08:51] <GetShwifty1> it has probably not  been plugged in for a total of 1-2 hours of total  life span lol
[01:09:02] <GetShwifty1> maybe 5
[01:09:13] <GetShwifty1> if there ever was atime where it idled for 15 minutes or something before i pulled it out
[01:09:18] <_Shurik_> that is also a problem
[01:09:31] <irwiss> fwiw not being connected can leak charge
[01:09:32] <_Shurik_> mosfets lose charge
[01:09:55] <_Shurik_> should be plugged in once in a while
[01:10:04] <GetShwifty1> which it does lol
[01:10:12] <GetShwifty1> use it once ever other month or so
[01:10:26] <_Shurik_> Then just a shitty USB stick
[01:10:33] <GetShwifty1> quite possibly
[01:10:48] <_Shurik_> man, they've gotten so cheap, I just ordered like 5 64gig ones for... $30?
[01:10:55] <GetShwifty1> yeah
[01:11:01] <GetShwifty1> but the QOL on those cheap ones lol
[01:11:16] <GetShwifty1> fairly high deffective rate / short term usage
[01:11:26] <_Shurik_> right
[01:11:29] <GetShwifty1> basically the dash cam people say if you're spending 30-60$ on it
[01:11:36] <GetShwifty1> expect to replace it every 3-6 months
[01:11:50] <GetShwifty1> if you need to ever rely on being able to use  footage
[01:11:56] <_Shurik_> hmm, not sure about that
[01:12:15] <GetShwifty1> it's what i've seen recommended for pretty much everything
[01:12:16] <_Shurik_> although will find out
[01:12:26] <GetShwifty1> including some of the mfrs of dash cams who  provide guidance
[01:12:26] <_Shurik_> I just equipped all of my cars with dashcams about 3 months ago
[01:12:54] <GetShwifty1> think my friend got away with 1 year~ but think he said he was getting some errors last time he pulled it out
[01:13:24] <_Shurik_> My drones' SDs are all good. But then again I don't record that often
[01:13:34] <GetShwifty1> but yeah if you ever rely  on it (e.g. more for commercial vehicles liability, etc)  yeah check/replace more frequently
[01:13:45] <GetShwifty1> yeah dahscams i think tend to do a lot of recording and then wiping
[01:13:47] <_Shurik_> very good point
[01:13:56] <_Shurik_> what's a good SD health check utility?
[01:15:12] <merced> anything that reads SMART tbh
[01:15:15] <GetShwifty1> think my friend uses a *nix based cmd line utility to probe SMART
[01:15:22] <GetShwifty1> and do additional spot sector  checking
[01:15:35] <_Shurik_> SDs don't have SMART
[01:15:42] <_Shurik_> as far as I'm aware
[01:15:51] <GetShwifty1> some do
[01:15:51] <GetShwifty1> some dont
[01:16:03] <GetShwifty1> cheap ones i think typically might not , the higher end / industrial ones will generally
[01:16:21] <GetShwifty1> that's why (and its still good to do somethign that does a spot sector checking)
[01:16:23] <_Shurik_> but good point.  I should schedule SD card replacement every so often
[01:16:27] <GetShwifty1> yeah
[01:17:39] <irwiss> could also get high quality ones from camera shops, they're usually rated for speed as well
[01:18:02] <irwiss> the jank from ebay and other crapware retailers are like 70% fake or defects
[01:18:08] <_Shurik_> heh, can't believe they are not making raid 1 SD configs for dashcams
[01:18:31] <_Shurik_> yeah, my 4k drones are picky about type of SD card they take
[01:18:32] <GetShwifty1> one of the side effects of an SD Card failing is often timeout
[01:18:33] <GetShwifty1> so
[01:18:43] <GetShwifty1> prolly would not do well in a RAID setup lol
[01:18:58] <_Shurik_> well that's a hardware problem
[01:19:34] <_Shurik_> it's just about writing to two cards at the same time
[01:19:35] <irwiss> don't need raid usually, decent UHS class card can do fairly good write speed
[01:20:05] <_Shurik_> irwiss: well, most of applications are tolerant to data loss.  So your video didn't get recorded
[01:20:15] <_Shurik_> in case of dashcam it's kinda big deal
[01:20:34] <_Shurik_> GetShwifty1 got me thinking now
[01:20:35] <irwiss> my dashcam beeps if card starts failing
[01:21:01] <_Shurik_> yeah and how soon do you address that issue?
[01:21:11] <irwiss> so a raid1 or whatever would probably protect the 1%-ish time between card failures, at 2x the cost
[01:21:39] <_Shurik_> I would implement delayed raid 1.  Card 0 is being written to constantly, Card 1 get synced up to periodically
[01:21:56] <_Shurik_> for less chances of failure of second card
[01:22:08] <irwiss> considering i only had a single use of my 2 dashcams in 7 years it's like... not super realistic scenario to hit that tiny slice of time where a card fails exactly when you get into an incident where you need it
[01:22:45] <_Shurik_> Holly fuck, Unreal engine builds executable forever
[01:23:29] <_Shurik_>  finally a reason to upgrade to i9
[01:24:29] <_Shurik_> couldn't stress my i7-8700 enough before getting into 3D engines

[01:43:39] <GetShwifty1> yeah irwiss what _Shurik_ and I are discussing are typically more commercial/industrial scenarios / applications
[01:43:55] <GetShwifty1> where it is more critical that footage not be lost if needed
[01:44:36] *** Joins: blezz (~blez@213-130-92-213.ip.btc-net.bg)
[01:47:10] <GetShwifty1> really need to come up with a better way to only partially load  certain controllers in an assembly instead of ALL of them
[01:47:51] <irwiss> even "commercial" scenarios just move the data off sd cards
[01:48:05] <GetShwifty1> fleets generally don't have that luxury
[01:48:26] <GetShwifty1> and if you are not doing regularly maintenance and ensuring that every single card is working .. you can get in an incident.. not have footage ..
[01:48:30] <GetShwifty1> and that can cost you money/etc
[01:48:37] <_Shurik_> for comm, I'd use SSD
[01:48:53] <_Shurik_> if it is that mission critical
[01:49:03] <irwiss> if you don't buy cheap garbage the sd cards sold in camera shops are very reliable
[01:49:04] <GetShwifty1> yeah the more mission critical the more you try to get away from SD cards
[01:49:25] <irwiss> but even professional photographers just shovel the data to proper storage asap
[01:49:26] <GetShwifty1> but not ALL businesses have the luxury / profit margin to go to the most high end especially since fme
[01:49:40] <GetShwifty1> the more expensive dahscam setups that take that can be 1500-3500 per
[01:49:48] <GetShwifty1> so sometimes have to balance
[01:49:58] <_Shurik_> irwiss: for photography, SDs don't get hammered that bad
[01:50:04] <_Shurik_> video is a different beast
[01:50:17] <irwiss> that sorta depends how you shoot
[01:50:18] <GetShwifty1> and understanding the quality of your SD cards and their recomended life duration, can be important
[01:51:25] <GetShwifty1> and in this case also recommend that one understands the recommended usage too, cause different classes / quality of SD cards are used to different levels of usage and consequently some are recommended for one use/purpose, and not recommended for other use/purpose

[02:17:03] <Arokh> Hi, EF Core Mapping Problem: I have two Layers the DB Layer with EF Core stuff and a Model layer and I can map from Model to DB and vice versa at any point. Now when I start with some model instances and do manipulations to them (which doesn't involve the db layer) I want to save them to database.
[02:17:06] <Arokh>  Currently I'm using DomainEvents to track all the changes with which I'm able to save to the DB. But this is getting increasingly complex in some cases so I'm looking for another strategy. One idea I have is to map from the model to db before and after I did the model manipluations. Is there any ready to use ef core feature which issues the necessary commands if I give it a current and target
[02:17:07] <Arokh> entity? It would need to handle nested and deleted entities as well.
[02:18:06] <GetShwifty1> did change tracking/auditing ever make it back  into EF ?

[02:20:02] <Arokh> Yep there is Changetracking in EF Core but since I'm not doing the manipulations in the db layer it doesn't pick up on them.

[02:24:14] <Kim^J> Arokh: Why are you doing this?
[02:25:52] <GetShwifty> why is that the question being asked ?
[02:28:32] <Nasp> GetShwifty:  Why are you using service locator?
[02:28:42] <GetShwifty> cause it's cool?
[02:28:47] <Arokh> Kim^J, what do you mean? The separation between DB and Model layer?
[02:28:59] <Nasp> GetShwifty:  Going without them is more cool
[02:29:17] <GetShwifty> i was under the impression now that .net core did SL by default
[02:29:23] <GetShwifty> the new cool was the old cool
[02:29:23] <Nasp> No
[02:29:36] <Nasp> Core doesn't use SL by default
[02:29:53] <GetShwifty> .net Core Web Projects (?)
[02:29:56] <GetShwifty> are we being pedantic ? lol
[02:29:58] <Nasp> Nope
[02:30:02] <GetShwifty> mm yes?
[02:30:16] <GetShwifty> iterally uses DI/SL
[02:30:28] <Nasp> I havent seen any service locator use really
[02:30:43] <Nasp> Maybe for certain types of middleware
[02:31:01] <GetShwifty> what do you call IServiceProvider?
[02:31:10] <Nasp> IoC
[02:31:13] <GetShwifty> and injecting stuff into constructors pulled/resolved from the IServicePRovider
[02:31:13] <GetShwifty> okay
[02:31:19] <GetShwifty> Then IoC lol
[02:31:28] <Nasp> But do you use the IServiceProvider everywhere you need to resolve a service?
[02:32:32] <GetShwifty> pretty much
[02:32:49] <GetShwifty> well i don't use IServiceProvider directly everywhere
[02:33:02] <GetShwifty> not sure what you're specifically asking for
[02:33:04] <Nasp> Why are you doing that
[02:33:08] <Nasp> Why not just inject it in ctor?
[02:33:14] <GetShwifty> read my clarification lol
[02:33:43] <GetShwifty> i only DIRECTLY ever use IServiceProvider (injected via constructor) IF i need to implement a Factory Pattern
[02:33:51] <GetShwifty> otherwise yeah. everyting is injected via constructor
[02:34:04] <GetShwifty> *automagically*
[02:34:21] <Nasp> Yeah that's not service locatorl but good
[02:34:36] <Nasp> Also can't you inject Func<T> with MS DI?
[02:35:00] <GetShwifty> i've not poked around too much with that
[02:35:12] <GetShwifty> typically when i need to use IServiceProvider directly it's because i have to do logic and instantiate based upon lgoic
[02:35:38] <GetShwifty> which ARGUABLY you probably should create your own IMyFactoryProvider<TType> that CAN ONLY inject TType where applicable
[02:35:39] <Nasp> Hmm i've rarely needed it
[02:35:54] <Nasp> Only in a few places where i need to control the lifetime myself
[02:35:56] <GetShwifty> but that's just one minor little headache i've not gotten around to doing
[02:36:11] <GetShwifty> i have a lot of database / data  driven stuff
[02:37:02] <GetShwifty> so basically if This Application, need to instantiate Xyz, if That Application need to instantate Abc . both are a common interface that but implement differing functionality through same contract
[02:40:43] <Nasp> It can be a bit annoying when you have a common interface that needs to be resolved to two different implementations
[02:41:10] <GetShwifty> yeah, i yhave a surprisingy large amount of that in this application
[02:41:24] <GetShwifty> and most of it is very data driven
[02:42:00] <GetShwifty> so that stuff gets put into cuwtom factories that use IServiceProvider, then inject the factory wherever you need to esolve the correct one to  invoke the action

[08:46:00] <jamea> wich is bad?

[08:57:59] <jamea> in the first... i send with post... method is normal not work but in second?
[08:59:13] <GetShwifty> method not allowed
[08:59:17] <GetShwifty> usually means you got something wrong
[08:59:23] <GetShwifty> like using GET not Post
[08:59:24] <GetShwifty> , etc
[08:59:42] <GetShwifty> or maybe invalid url
[08:59:59] <GetShwifty> should use fiddler  if possible to trace the two and compare curl's output to yours
[09:01:35] <jamea> with postman work too... use GET Method
[09:01:43] <jamea> second way: RestRequest request = new RestRequest(Method.PUT);
[09:01:50] <jamea> i specified PUT method

[20:58:02] <Nasp> MatthiasVance:  I have like 9 locking points on my door
[20:58:02] <GetShwifty> there's a lawyer who has a website dedicated to smart locks / non smart locks
[20:58:11] <GetShwifty> and ones that can be hacked in under 5 minutes

[20:58:39] <GetShwifty> tbh
[20:58:44] <GetShwifty> loks are useless 99% of the times
[20:58:48] <Nasp> yeah
[20:58:50] <MatthiasVance> Technically if you have a normal lock (not *** spec) it can *also* be hacked in < 5 mins GetShwifty
[20:58:53] <GetShwifty> because the door/ door frame can't withhold
[20:58:53] <Nasp> My normal lock is useless as well

[20:59:07] <GetShwifty> he does non smart locks aka regular stuff too
[20:59:19] <Nasp> The lock picking lawyer can pick anything in less than a minute
[20:59:45] <Nasp> Also i still haven't seen a smart lock that can be attach to the doorphone as well
[21:00:51] <GetShwifty> the more things it attaches to the more ways it can be hacked!
[21:01:51] <MatthiasVance> I wonder about the insurance :)
[21:02:03] <Nasp> Insurance doesn't cover if someone picks your lock either
[21:02:07] <MatthiasVance> It should at least be a lock according to some security specification
[21:02:23] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: Heh? Of course it does?
[21:02:27] <Nasp> Not here
[21:02:31] <MatthiasVance> If you have a proper lock, that is
[21:02:33] <Nasp> There needs to be sign of force entry

[21:03:22] <GetShwifty> e.g. if you can prove that somebody actually picked it with footage
[21:03:25] <GetShwifty> then isnurance will cover it
[21:03:37] <GetShwifty> (beacuse you're proving there was actual forced/unauthorized entry)

[21:06:08] <GetShwifty> mmm
[21:06:15] <Nasp> It's so strange
[21:06:18] <GetShwifty> *forced /unauthorized entryh
[21:06:21] <Nasp> Also if the police are lazy you can't either
[21:06:24] <GetShwifty> here in america technically
[21:06:32] <GetShwifty> you can even file a claim IF
[21:06:35] <Nasp> Since it's not always they want to make a report, and the insurance company requires that report
[21:06:38] <GetShwifty> you can get police to make an arreest
[21:06:49] <GetShwifty> e.g. if a family memeber stole something and you can prove..it, they arrest
[21:06:57] <Nasp> You cant do that here
[21:07:07] <Nasp> Same if an exgirlfriend or someone has a key
[21:07:13] <Nasp> Then it's not theft since they have a key
[21:07:29] <GetShwifty> well yeah if they have a key then it borders on the ..
[21:07:37] <GetShwifty> which is why you change locks , etc
[21:08:18] <Nasp> I've also advised that we should consider changing the complex doors to electronic locks when they break
[21:08:30] <Nasp> Since so many people have keys to get inside the stairwells
[21:08:45] <GetShwifty> lol
[21:08:59] <GetShwifty> electronic door locks are as bad as regular doors, just for different reasons
[21:09:17] <GetShwifty> most common things with electronic door locks from 7 years of seeing them be used. they never close/latch properly after a year or 2
[21:09:50] <GetShwifty> think we currently have 3 ouot of 7 that don't latch when you go through
[21:10:05] <GetShwifty> one all the time, the other 2 are intermittent depending upon how you exit and how swiftly the door closes
[21:11:01] <GetShwifty> next favorite thing to break is that they don't open when you scan it, either because the locking/release mechanism is broken or one of 10 common faults with your fob / scanning / communicating with the server lmao
[21:11:06] <Nasp> The normal doors doesn't close properly either
[21:11:26] <Nasp> I'm just saying, when the locks break, why not switch them out with electronic key swabs
[21:11:42] <Nasp> But yeah why can't we make doors that closes properly
[21:11:46] <Nasp> Is it really that hard
[21:11:51] <Nasp> Key fob
[21:11:51] <GetShwifty> keypads are actually worse
[21:11:53] <Nasp> That was it's name
[21:11:56] <GetShwifty> okay
[21:11:59] <GetShwifty> yeah fobs are good
[21:12:05] <GetShwifty> keypads are worse than keys because you just tell them the 4 digit code
[21:12:08] <Nasp> I want fobs next time they break
[21:12:13] <Nasp> We have to pay for a new system anyways
[21:12:26] <Nasp> And then we slowly get less and less people who lived here who still has the keys
[21:12:33] <Nasp> Keypads are annoying
[21:12:42] <Nasp> We had them at the old workplace and someone decided that touchkeys was a good idea
[21:12:48] <GetShwifty> lol
[21:12:49] <Nasp> Took ages to enter your 6 digit pin
[21:12:54] <Nasp> Finally they got physical switches
[21:13:00] <Nasp> Then you could enter it in less than a second
[21:13:10] <Nasp> Else you had to press, wait, press, wait, press wait
[21:13:11] <GetShwifty> but everybody gets everybodys covid
[21:13:11] <GetShwifty> lol
[21:13:19] <Nasp> I dont get why everything needs to be touch
[21:13:23] <GetShwifty> yeah
[21:13:24] <Nasp> Same in the busses and trains
[21:13:28] <GetShwifty> contactless
[21:13:32] <Nasp> Ohh you want to exit? You can't do it with closes on then
[21:13:40] <Nasp> gloves*
[21:13:56] <GetShwifty> they're trying to help the spread and proliferation of viruses!
[21:15:04] <Nasp> Wouldn't a physical button be cheaper and less error prone?
[21:15:12] *** Quits: k8yun (~k8yun@user/k8yun) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[21:15:17] <GetShwifty> mmmm
[21:15:29] <GetShwifty> technically speaking i think the touch pad should be less prone to problems
[21:15:30] <Nasp> They also put in sensors in the trains that doesn't work, the only way they can register you is if you raise your hands up to them
[21:15:39] <Nasp> So walking through the train you are doing the nazi salute
[21:15:40] <GetShwifty> at least from a casualty standpoint
[21:15:43] <Nasp> And no i'm not kidding
[21:15:57] <GetShwifty> I find that amusing / ironic Nasp :D
[21:17:30] <Nasp> Also in my car, touch everything
[21:17:43] <Nasp> Want to turn down the AC? Just press 5 times on the touch display
[21:17:46] <GetShwifty> Shouldn't have boughten Apples E-Car
[21:17:47] <GetShwifty> lol
[21:18:00] <GetShwifty> what car do you have so i know NOT to buy that lol
[21:18:03] <Nasp> touch is fine, but certain stuff should be easy to access
[21:18:05] <Nasp> Citroen
[21:18:09] <GetShwifty> never heard of it
[21:18:11] <GetShwifty> who makes it?
[21:18:19] <Nasp> Like when im driving on the highway i want to look as little as possible on the touchscreen to adjust the heating
[21:18:25] <Nasp> The french?
[21:18:25] <GetShwifty> yueah
[21:18:44] <Nasp> It has Android auto integration which works
[21:18:49] <GetShwifty> here in usa afaik most cars are still primarily tacticle feedback buttons
[21:18:50] <Nasp> But i can't tell it to turn down the heating
[21:19:00] <Nasp> Most cars gets those ripped out
[21:19:01] <GetShwifty> that are usually easy to find while driving
[21:19:08] <Nasp> Not even analog speedometers anymore
[21:19:11] <Nasp> Just a digital display
[21:19:21] <Nasp> Yeah physical buttons are much easier to just grab and turn down
[21:19:41] <GetShwifty> 3 most important things with a car
[21:19:43] <GetShwifty> do i look cool in it
[21:19:50] <GetShwifty> can i shut the display off permanently
[21:20:16] <GetShwifty> and is the heating / cooling easy to adjust and does it make sense without having to break out the manual while i'm on the highway every time i want to adjust the temp
[21:20:16] <GetShwifty> lol
[21:20:41] <Nasp> Heating and music should be easy adjustable
[21:20:47] <GetShwifty> yep
[21:20:58] <Nasp> Also it's rather stupid, the side mirrors are electronic like in most cars
[21:21:04] <Nasp> But it's not tied to the key
[21:21:11] <Nasp> So if you are two users of the car it can't remember who it is
[21:21:25] <GetShwifty> hah
[21:21:27] <Nasp> Or maybe i should read the manual because it has some profile support
[21:21:28] <GetShwifty> yeah that would be TOO SMART
[21:21:28] <GetShwifty> lmao
[21:21:35] <Nasp> But maybe you need to configure it, instead of it just working out of the box
[21:21:40] <GetShwifty> would be nice if mirror / seat placement/adjsutmetns
[21:21:44] <Nasp> Like if it's already software controlled, why not make that part as well
[21:21:45] <GetShwifty> had memories lmao
[21:21:50] <Nasp> Seat adjustment is usually a premium feature
[21:21:57] <GetShwifty> ??????????????????????????
[21:22:05] <GetShwifty> god
[21:22:13] <GetShwifty> you guys live in a 3rd world country as far as cars are concerned
[21:22:19] <GetShwifty> YOU GUYS ARE THE CONTINENT THAT GAVE US BMW
[21:22:23] <GetShwifty> lol
[21:22:27] <Nasp> Reemmber cars here here are 2x the cost due to taxes
[21:22:32] <GetShwifty> here i am bitching that
[21:22:33] <Nasp> So any extra features are usualyl stripped
[21:22:47] <GetShwifty> Seat adjustments that we have had for 2 decades and for the last decade are usually mostly electronic
[21:22:50] <GetShwifty> don't have memory/porofies
[21:22:56] <Nasp> I've never seen a car with it
[21:22:57] <GetShwifty> youre all like man seat adjustments would be nice
[21:22:57] <GetShwifty> lol
[21:23:17] <GetShwifty> #FirstWorldProblems :-p
[21:23:21] <GetShwifty> jk
[21:23:31] <Nasp> Also it's first now automatic gears seems to be more normal
[21:23:35] <Nasp> Although still not common
[21:23:38] <GetShwifty> lmao
[21:23:43] <Nasp> I drive my first automatic car 4 months ago
[21:23:47] <Nasp> Everythings stick
[21:23:50] <GetShwifty> manual has been hard to find
[21:23:54] <GetShwifty> for prolly a good decade+
[21:23:59] <Nasp> I rented a car and sat in and looked down at the pedal "wtf"
[21:24:01] <GetShwifty> unless you go to 'power vehicles'
[21:24:05] <Nasp> D must be for drive right?
[21:24:10] <GetShwifty> lol
[21:24:16] <GetShwifty> yeah
[21:24:20] <Nasp> I was just thinking "Shit" there for a second
[21:24:24] <GetShwifty> lmao
[21:24:28] <Nasp> Probably the same reaction an American would get if they got a stick car
[21:24:32] <GetShwifty> "sir, i asked for a vehicle!
[21:24:41] <Nasp> But man automatc was nice
[21:24:43] <GetShwifty> ilearned on a stick
[21:24:51] <GetShwifty> but havent driven stick in prolly almost 2 decades
[21:24:54] <GetShwifty> wonder if i remember
[21:25:08] <Nasp> I've driven automatic for 7 hours
[21:25:13] <GetShwifty> lol
[21:25:30] <Nasp> But yeah taxes on cars
[21:25:35] <GetShwifty> do you guiys have cruise control?
[21:25:40] <Nasp> Also certain security features are stripped as well because it's too expensive
[21:25:45] <Nasp> Cruise control are normal now i think
[21:25:49] <GetShwifty> ok
[21:25:50] <Nasp> But it new as well
[21:25:52] <GetShwifty> whew
[21:25:53] <GetShwifty> hahah
[21:25:59] <Nasp> Like this is my first car with cruise control
[21:28:16] <GetShwifty> water company suddenly started being stupid
[21:28:26] <GetShwifty> paid bill 5 days ago. everything is digital.
[21:28:41] *** Joins: Autowired (~autowired@dslb-094-218-237-093.094.218.pools.vodafone-ip.de)
[21:28:44] <Nasp> Can you actually pay non digital?
[21:28:45] <GetShwifty> but now they send notifications that the bill needs to be paid.. i assume without bothering to check if it has been paid
[21:28:52] <GetShwifty> you can if you want to
[21:29:00] <Nasp> Well usually transfer can take 1-2 days
[21:29:01] *** Quits: ToAruShiroiNeko (~eva@user/toarushiroineko) ()
[21:29:03] <GetShwifty> but since i get 1.5% cash back on my biz credit  card
[21:29:06] <Nasp> I dont think you can pay non digital here
[21:29:07] <GetShwifty> i pay digitally
[21:29:26] <Nasp> Like that's where we are a bit a heard, everythings digital
[21:29:27] <GetShwifty> but credit cards batch generally within 24 business hours
[21:29:33] <Nasp> IRS and such all automatic
[21:29:36] <GetShwifty> and PREVIOUSLY
[21:29:40] <GetShwifty> they NEVER EVER did this
[21:29:43] <Nasp> I've never understodo cash back
[21:29:45] <GetShwifty> but just recently they started doing it
[21:29:52] <Nasp> Can't i just pay from my own webshop?
[21:29:55] <Nasp> -> infinite moneys
[21:30:00] <GetShwifty> it's basically a reward for spending money
[21:30:09] <GetShwifty> you get 1- 1.5% cash back on eveythign
[21:30:20] <GetShwifty> and then on SPecial things (usually very CONSUMERYY things) you often times get 5% cash back
[21:30:25] <GetShwifty> so restaurants, movies, etc
[21:30:40] <Nasp> Yeah i dont get that
[21:30:41] <GetShwifty> since i never do consumery stuff i just go for the card that gives me the highest cash back on everything
[21:30:43] <Nasp> And why would they do that
[21:30:56] <GetShwifty> because it entices people to use credit cards?
[21:31:09] <Nasp> But why would a bank care about that
[21:31:34] <GetShwifty> beause they want you using THEIR card
[21:31:36] <GetShwifty> and not sombody elses
[21:31:50] <GetShwifty> and as the REAL why
[21:31:53] <Nasp>  But i assume they have some business incentive to do so
[21:31:55] <GetShwifty> probably 50% of people DONT
[21:32:00] <GetShwifty> pay off their creditcard balance every month
[21:32:08] <Nasp> Like if they give you 5% back, then they atleast need to earn 6% for a payment
[21:32:08] <GetShwifty> and thats where theymake their money
[21:32:13] <GetShwifty> no
[21:32:14] <Nasp> Ohh creditcard
[21:32:20] <Nasp> Yeah never had one of those
[21:32:25] <Nasp> Now i get it
[21:32:29] <GetShwifty> i have it
[21:32:34] <GetShwifty> pay my balance off every month
[21:32:35] <Nasp> Ofc one of those just use money and pay later cards
[21:32:35] <GetShwifty> well *them
[21:32:41] <Nasp> Like a quick loan
[21:32:56] <Nasp> I think technicly my Visa is a creditcard when i'm aboard
[21:33:00] <Nasp> But when i use it locally it's a debitcard
[21:33:11] <GetShwifty> lol that's interesting
[21:33:26] <Nasp> But i haven't used my card in 3 years or so now, i just pay with my phone
[21:33:40] <GetShwifty> but using the digital version fo the card?
[21:33:45] <Nasp> Google pay yeah
[21:33:58] <GetShwifty> i thought google had done away with that
[21:34:02] <Nasp> My bank even gave me 10 $ for using google pay
[21:34:12] <Nasp> No it's widely used here together with apple pay
[21:34:28] <Nasp> Only annoying thing is Google have some licensing issues regarding paying from smartwatches
[21:34:29] <GetShwifty> okay i must be thinking of something else they made and tiscontinued in favor for google pay
[21:34:32] <Nasp> Only apple can do that for some reason
[21:34:36] <GetShwifty> haha
[21:34:36] <GetShwifty> yeay
[21:34:41] <Nasp> Are you thinking google wallet maybe?
[21:34:46] <GetShwifty> that's prolly what i'm thinking of
[21:34:56] *** Joins: ToAruShiroiNeko (~eva@user/toarushiroineko)
[21:35:50] <Nasp> It's also getting increasingly harder to use cash for anything
[21:36:04] <GetShwifty> i honestly thought you guys were long past that point
[21:36:05] <GetShwifty> hah
[21:36:16] <GetShwifty> thjey used COVID  as an opportunity to try to eliminate it
[21:36:33] <GetShwifty> it would be curious to see pre / mid and post what % of people are / were using cash and for what
[21:36:44] <GetShwifty> either they'e rescinded a lot of the things
[21:36:58] <GetShwifty> OR people have gotten used to it cause i've not seen the signs / people out saying 'this only accepts cards.. etc'
[21:37:06] <GetShwifty> or asking if they're using card/ cash
[21:37:27] <GetShwifty> i personally dont' care cause cash is very inconvenient
[21:37:38] <Nasp> Well legally you have to accept cash, but some companies are trying to circumvent those rules
[21:37:42] <Nasp> And some want those laws changed
[21:37:45] <Nasp> Although i'm against it
[21:37:57] <GetShwifty> yueah i sort of have mixed feelings about it
[21:37:59] <Nasp> Well COVID changed nothing in regards to cash really
[21:38:05] <Nasp> Most used cards
[21:38:19] <Nasp> I just believe cash should always be an option
[21:38:23] <GetShwifty> it changed a lot here cause we are / were still fairly heavy cash
[21:39:37] <GetShwifty> 26% (2019 -recovid) down from 30% (2017)
[21:39:49] <GetShwifty> ooh
[21:39:56] <GetShwifty> 19% (May 2021)
[21:40:06] <GetShwifty> so yeah they successfully made a huge dent
[21:40:08] <Nasp> Was covid the cause or just natural progression?
[21:40:16] <GetShwifty> COVID was the cause of a lot of it
[21:40:17] <Nasp> But yeah cash is inconvenient
[21:40:46] <GetShwifty> they're not sure if the changes are transitory
[21:40:59] <GetShwifty> much like they were pretty sure inflation was simply transitory lol
[21:41:42] <GetShwifty> but yeah with it dipping below 20% i can see that over the next 5 years there being  more less subtle pushes to cash-less
[21:43:19] <Nasp> I would still argue that should'nt be a reason to remove cash
[21:43:43] <GetShwifty> i would argue that you are correct FOR certain things
[21:44:10] <GetShwifty> like i would say certain staples that low income people need to pay for to have a basic living
[21:44:27] <GetShwifty> because generally speaking it's the low income people  that have the most trouble in a digital world
[21:44:54] <GetShwifty> but for everything else i recognize that cash can be  inconvenient for both consumers AND business owners
[21:45:00] <GetShwifty> huge liability for business owners
[21:45:23] <GetShwifty> so from business owners perspective there are huge reasons to mostly get rid of cash
[21:48:23] <Nasp> We just can't say to x percentage of people that they can no longer buy stuff in stores
[21:48:40] <GetShwifty> well with the elimination of cash
[21:48:49] <GetShwifty> there should be ways to go digital
[21:48:59] <GetShwifty> e.g. pre/re-loadable cards
[21:49:08] <GetShwifty> which I assume is something you guys have?
[21:49:36] <GetShwifty> buit from a business perspective
[21:49:39] <GetShwifty> if it costs you say
[21:49:50] <GetShwifty> 350k a year in additional employees, staff and risk/liability insurance
[21:50:00] <Nasp> Still, cash always works
[21:50:01] *** Joins: DrowningElysium (uid190788@user/drowningelysium)
[21:50:03] <GetShwifty> because you carry cash that accounts for say 1%-5% of your business
[21:50:06] <Nasp> And old people and people who can't have a bank can use them
[21:50:13] <GetShwifty> yeah
[21:50:17] <Nasp> I would say it's not a liability from a business perspective
[21:50:21] <GetShwifty> it is
[21:50:22] <GetShwifty> a HUGE
[21:50:24] <GetShwifty> fucking liability
[21:50:24] <Nasp> It would be mostly everyone who pays cashless
[21:50:29] <Nasp> It's not
[21:50:32] <GetShwifty> sl any small business
[21:50:37] <GetShwifty> gets robbed
[21:50:38] <Nasp> Are you thinking robbery?
[21:50:40] <GetShwifty> all the fucking times
[21:50:40] <Nasp> Nah
[21:50:49] <GetShwifty> you have to deposit that cash
[21:50:50] <GetShwifty> eveyr night
[21:50:58] <Nasp> A store doesn't really have any money due to cashless payments
[21:50:58] <GetShwifty> employees run off with it
[21:51:00] <GetShwifty> it gets stolen
[21:51:06] <GetShwifty> EXACTLY
[21:51:06] <Nasp> So it would only be the people who pay with cash
[21:51:14] <GetShwifty> so you have this huge security ridden process
[21:51:23] <GetShwifty> for something that makesy ou 1-5% of your money
[21:51:32] <Nasp> A store has what, barely 1000 dollars in cash if yo uare lucky
[21:51:38] <GetShwifty> yeah
[21:51:41] <Nasp> That's nothing
[21:51:48] <GetShwifty> and it may easily costs them 250 - 500$ a day MINIMUM
[21:51:57] <Nasp> Why?
[21:52:00] <GetShwifty> to deposit that cash  daily
[21:52:14] <Nasp> They just put them in the vault
[21:52:16] <GetShwifty> because you have to pay an employee to take that money, count it up anmther employee has to DOUBLE count
[21:52:19] <GetShwifty> then you have to drive it to the
[21:52:35] <Nasp> No you have to be insane to drive with money like that
[21:52:37] <GetShwifty> i've  worked  with cash management  for small businesses
[21:52:44] <GetShwifty> it is a very timely procedure
[21:52:46] <GetShwifty> the worst part about it is
[21:52:50] <Nasp> You dumpt it in a vault and every week or so a company comes and pick it up
[21:52:52] <GetShwifty> whether its 750 or 10k
[21:52:57] <GetShwifty> it takes approximately the same time
[21:53:16] <GetShwifty> so yeah like i said, from a business perspective i can see why businesses want to get rid of it
[21:54:14] <Nasp> Sure, but then we could just as well kill the poor people while we are at it
[21:54:20] <Nasp> Poor and old
[21:54:23] <GetShwifty> and it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. the less people who carry cahs, the less money you're making from all of your cash policies/workflows. the more you want to just get rid of it
[21:54:29] <GetShwifty> again like i said
[21:54:36] <GetShwifty> i basically say - there are some staples
[21:54:47] <GetShwifty> and there should be ways for people go from cash to digital
[21:55:08] <GetShwifty> so you go to the atm, insert your card, you deposit 150$ cash, and the card now has 150$
[21:56:00] <GetShwifty> Jan 6, 2021 · 73 percent of transactions across Europe are conducted in cash, with cards the most popular cashless payment option, accounting for 24 ...
[21:56:01] <GetShwifty> wtf
[21:56:26] <GetShwifty> wow
[21:56:53] <GetShwifty> iwas expecting europe to be half of what we were lol
[21:58:00] <Nasp> Also with current economy you kinda want your cash
[21:58:09] <Nasp> Since if you put them in a bank they take 1% of your money
[21:58:13] <GetShwifty> ?
[21:58:19] <Nasp> So you kinda want to do like in the old ays and sew them into the mattress
[21:58:21] <GetShwifty> why do they take 1% of your money
[21:58:27] <Nasp> Due to negative interests
[21:58:31] <GetShwifty> oh?
[21:58:46] <GetShwifty> you guys are in negative interest?
[21:59:12] <Nasp> yes entire euro
[21:59:18] <Nasp> european union
[21:59:19] <GetShwifty> oh snap
[21:59:27] <GetShwifty> wow surrpseid that went under the radar
[21:59:45] <GetShwifty> do they actually charge consumers negative interest?
[22:00:53] <GetShwifty> oh no
[22:00:55] <GetShwifty> banks arent
[22:01:03] <GetShwifty> they're just eating any up and making sure they lend money
[22:02:23] <GetShwifty> i was trying to court japanese investors for a while when japan was in heavy negative interest a god while back
[22:02:24] <GetShwifty> lol
[22:02:33] <GetShwifty> didn't know enough japanese to make  that work though

[22:08:38] <Nasp> GetShwifty:  Yes they are charging negative interests
[22:08:46] <Nasp> Also there's like 100 dollar fees on a bank account
[22:09:21] <GetShwifty> okay
[22:09:32] <GetShwifty> the study i read said most banks werent they just lowered consumer savings rates
[22:09:59] <Nasp> Nope
[22:10:31] <Nasp> So if you have money saved up, it's better to just have it in cash at home
[22:10:46] <GetShwifty> i mean i like to ensure my cash is invested and EARNING me money ;)
[22:11:55] <Nasp> Sure but that also carries a certain risk
[22:14:56] <GetShwifty> no pain no gain

[22:15:35] * Suchiman bicycled 26km yesterday, so much pain
[22:15:57] <GetShwifty> nice!
[22:16:06] <GetShwifty> how regularly you cycle?
[22:16:12] * JakeSays last bicycled in 1989
[22:16:24] <GetShwifty> that's a good investment Suchiman :)
[22:16:31] <GetShwifty> wish i could get back into it
[22:16:57] <Suchiman> GetShwifty: started bicycling in mid january again after not having moved it for 15 years, done 7 tours
[22:17:14] <GetShwifty> cool, congrats!
[22:18:06] <JakeSays> Suchiman: isn't it a little cold for bicycling?
[22:18:29] <Suchiman> JakeSays: kinda
[22:18:32] <Suchiman> 6°C
[22:18:38] <GetShwifty> thats not too ba
[22:18:39] <GetShwifty> thats like what
[22:18:51] <GetShwifty> 43
[22:19:06] <Suchiman> head headwind the entire (13km) way back
[22:19:08] <GetShwifty> once you start moving unless you're facing a cold wind you get heated up pretty quickly
[22:19:16] <Suchiman> had*
[22:19:26] <GetShwifty> awww , always sucks when the headwind is on your way back instead of a tailwindon your way bck lol
[22:19:36] <JakeSays> Suchiman: well it least it wasn't both ways
[22:19:37] <petererer> Today there was a lot of wind... and then it rained.
[22:19:48] <Suchiman> it was so bad, it was going downhill and i had to pedal to keep moving
[22:19:56] <GetShwifty> Suchiman:  :D
[22:20:13] <GetShwifty> klol JakeSays on occassion on longer routes i've had that happen
[22:20:33] <GetShwifty> where the wind's changed not quite 180 degrees, but just enough so that on the way back yeah you get somewhat of a headwind , and you faced it going all the way in lol
[22:21:24] <JakeSays> when i was a kid i had to walk to school. it was up hill both ways
[22:21:37] <GetShwifty> IN THE DARK
[22:21:46] <GetShwifty> and it was global freezing back in those days none of thise global warming!

[22:44:54] <MatthiasVance> It has commands for that but when I tell it "TESTZ Z=-0.1" it moves up and down 0.1 mm or something

[22:49:19] <MatthiasVance> oh never mind it actually works but somehow it moves up a bit and then down a bit first, probably to get the distance right
[22:49:24] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: Yeah I figured you'd like it
[22:49:58] <JakeSays> their website sucks ass, but the machine looks cool
[22:56:01] <Nasp> So a woman got murdered last weekend, it's sad, but immediately politicians uses it as a play to change the rules and that women needs more protections since they are at a higher chanced of getting killed
[22:56:14] <Nasp> Someone pulled the numbers and there's a 20 times higher chance of getting killed as a male
