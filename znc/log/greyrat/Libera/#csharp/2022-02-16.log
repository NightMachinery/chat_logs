[00:00:10] <MatthiasVance> I'd have a lamp on / from the ceiling then :D

[00:00:57] <MatthiasVance> Hang the power from the ceiling then? :D
[00:01:01] <ki9a> like ever
[00:01:03] <MatthiasVance> That happens in spaces
[00:01:08] <MatthiasVance> Like presentation rooms etc
[00:01:14] <MatthiasVance> But mostly because it's really easy to do there
[00:01:21] <JakeSays> ki9a: most people don't, but i found it to be damn handy
[00:01:51] <MatthiasVance> If you say the room is a *working* room ki9a then I think we do?
[00:02:07] <MatthiasVance> Just not at home
[00:02:10] <MatthiasVance> usually
[00:02:34] <ki9a> not at ome
[00:02:47] <JakeSays> come to think of it, i've never known anyone else to do it
[00:03:30] <MatthiasVance> Also your house is much bigger so weird shit to us might start to make sense
[00:03:39] <JakeSays> but it was really nice to be able to place an outlet under a table.
[00:03:55] <MatthiasVance> And have a nice lamp on it, yeah I totally get that
[00:04:00] <MatthiasVance> (and maybe other stuff)
[00:04:22] <MatthiasVance> I wouldn't "ruin" my floor for that though
[00:04:38] <JakeSays> no, this floor was carpeted
[00:04:40] <MatthiasVance> ah
[00:05:01] <JakeSays> yeah i wouldn't do it with a beautiful hardwood floor

[00:05:34] <MatthiasVance> I was considering a nice wooden floor, or concrete, then I saw my 3yo throwing shit around .. nope .. better PVC
[00:05:57] <JakeSays> a plastic floor?
[00:06:55] <MatthiasVance> Yes, but not like in the old days
[00:10:14] <JakeSays> i'm not sure what a plastic floor would look like
[00:10:43] <JakeSays> another nice floor material is slate.
[00:11:57] <MatthiasVance> I just took a photo of an invoice I got with my banking app
[00:11:59] <MatthiasVance> And paid it

[00:12:38] <MatthiasVance> Apparently it uses Google Cloud Vision for that, Azure has comparable features

[00:12:47] <ki9a> yours
[00:12:49] <ki9a> right?
[00:13:00] <ki9a> Just looked for old folks interior
[00:13:02] <JakeSays> lol no
[00:13:32] <MatthiasVance> I have actually never liked our interior.. as in .. always felt like it could be more of a a.. whole
[00:13:48] <ki9a> Tip: Ikea does not make it a whole
[00:13:59] <MatthiasVance> Unless you buy everything from IKEA maybe?
[00:14:05] <MatthiasVance> xD

[00:19:04] <irwiss> "mine" is my mum's design, it looks like the above without the fireplace and old tv, and instead of artwork there's awkward niece pics for the next couple years at least... but i'm in bed already so cba to go photo it :P

[00:24:46] <JakeSays> *good sofa for fucking
[00:24:51] <MatthiasVance> *ambiguity
[00:25:00] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: cleared it up for you

[00:32:12] *** Joins: jamea (~jamea@10.189-202-213.bestelclientes.com.mx)
[00:33:05] <JakeSays> brianonymous: that kind of house deserves a special location, for sure
[00:33:24] <brianonymous> judging from the window, it looks coloradoy
[00:33:37] <JakeSays> yeah
[00:34:06] <MatthiasVance> color-a-d'oh
[00:34:39] <JakeSays> colorado is a weird state though
[00:34:56] <pandem> whats a normal state
[00:35:05] <MatthiasVance> Trick question
[00:35:24] <MatthiasVance> Side-note: My challenge this week is printing *succesfully* without adhesive
[00:35:27] <JakeSays> pandem: it's one of those "ya know it when ya see it" kind of things
[00:36:03] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: first get rid of that monster layer height
[00:36:26] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: I need that for the pressure advance tuning, but I didn't actually turn pressure advance tuning on so it might have had a higher speed
[00:36:48] <JakeSays> ah you were just tuning?
[00:36:49] <pandem> i think the most normal is north carolina
[00:36:58] <MatthiasVance> I think I should do some tests with a fine 0.12mm layer first
[00:37:11] <JakeSays> .1
[00:37:17] <MatthiasVance> Needs to be 0.04 increments
[00:37:39] <JakeSays> then .8, but i dont see why that's an issue
[00:38:02] <MatthiasVance> You do your first layer at 0.08?
[00:38:03] <JakeSays> layer height isn't as limited as layer width
[00:38:18] <JakeSays> no, i do my first layer usually at .2
[00:38:20] <MatthiasVance> ahh
[00:38:24] <MatthiasVance> yeah me too
[00:38:30] <JakeSays> well, .1 over the normal layer
[00:38:57] <JakeSays> but then i usually only use two heights - .1 and .2
[00:39:02] <MatthiasVance> I need to find some way to not completely cancel a print when things go wrong, but still remove the mess that didn't adhere to the bed
[00:39:09] <JakeSays> my latest project is all .2
[00:39:36] <MatthiasVance> *stick
[00:39:36] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: usually the mess that didn't adhere is a part of the print
[00:39:41] <MatthiasVance> indeed
[00:39:56] <MatthiasVance> I want a faster loop :P
[00:39:59] <JakeSays> which is usually not worth fixable
[00:40:04] <JakeSays> *fixing
[00:40:07] <MatthiasVance> No just for testing first layers
[00:40:10] <JakeSays> ah
[00:40:41] <JakeSays> i find that a clean bed is the key
[00:41:01] <JakeSays> if i prep the bed well i never have issues
[00:42:49] <MatthiasVance> I should buy some good alcohol then
[00:43:06] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: Don't you always use Bedweld?
[00:43:09] <MatthiasVance> or w/e it's called
[00:43:11] <JakeSays> i do
[00:43:44] <JakeSays> every few prints i'll wash the platter with dish soap and then re-apply bedweld
[00:44:00] <MatthiasVance> Yeah if I use the glue I won't have any issues for a few prints as well. First going to spend some time on tuning to see how well I can get it to work without
[00:44:22] <MatthiasVance> But maybe it makes sense to use the glue when tuning other stuff and then try it without
[00:44:29] <MatthiasVance> For the final steps
[00:44:30] <JakeSays> yeah
[00:44:44] <JakeSays> make that optimization the last
[00:46:45] <lz_> there's already a song with the guy from last week :D https://soundcloud.com/codecatt/abel-to-rage-ft-kitboga
[00:48:52] <lz_> I felt so so bad for the scammer lol
[00:49:04] <MatthiasVance> What .. are you talking about?
[00:49:23] <lz_> MatthiasVance: kitboga's call with abel last week, I mentioned it when it was happening
[00:49:45] <lz_> abel is a scammer but he was really smart in a weird way
[00:49:58] <JakeSays> a) who is kitboga b) who is abel
[00:50:04] <lz_> kitboga got him to do psychotherapy sessions with a fake patient and he was sort of good at it
[00:50:40] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: Just looked it up, someone pranking scam callers?
[00:50:51] <JakeSays> ah
[00:50:59] <MatthiasVance> And from context abel is a scammer
[00:51:17] <lz_> wait there are still people who don't know who kitboga is
[00:51:18] <lz_> wtf
[00:51:28] <MatthiasVance> There are people who don't know who Prince is
[00:51:41] <JakeSays> why would i know who kitboga is?
[00:52:15] <lz_> MatthiasVance: kitboga is a fucking genius :)
[00:52:29] <MatthiasVance> Is he also the one sending those trackable packages to people?
[00:52:36] <MatthiasVance> With paint bombs and whatnot
[00:52:44] <MatthiasVance> people -> scammers
[00:52:47] <lz_> no that's some guy i forgot his name
[00:52:50] <MatthiasVance> ah
[00:53:20] <lz_> MatthiasVance: kitboga is actually creating super cool stories, this is more theater than scam pranks
[00:53:21] <JakeSays> so is kitboga a mathematician or a physicist or some sort of engineer?
[00:53:28] <lz_> MatthiasVance: he's acting SUPER good
[00:53:42] <MatthiasVance> lz_: Do you have a link to the call you were talking about?
[00:54:03] <lz_> MatthiasVance: yes this is the last episode, but there were previous ones https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1293602210
[00:54:19] <lz_> all the calls with abel lasted sth like 10 hours
[00:54:21] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: When you do the paper test, how much resistance do you feel when you are happy with the z offset?
[00:54:40] <lz_> MatthiasVance: if you want I can find you the beginning of that story :D
[00:54:58] <lz_> MatthiasVance: otherwise it starts at 11min and he does a small recap
[00:55:22] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: i just eyeball the nozzle height instead of using paper. the paper didn'tseem to work well
[00:55:41] <MatthiasVance> lz_: Thanks I'll check it out!
[00:56:04] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: Ah, hm, so just above the bed then? :D Hard to transfer "what you see" knowledge xD
[00:56:10] <lz_> MatthiasVance: in this story he plays both Linda (a fake doctor with a "theoritical degree") and kim, one of her patient. He got the scammer to do a psy session with kim while he was supposed to buy some gift cards or something
[00:56:37] <lz_> MatthiasVance: in the song you can hear how that ended for abel :D he litterally lost his mind, poor guy
[00:57:34] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: lol yeah
[01:01:20] <brianonymous> MatthiasVance: https://twitter.com/okyrylchuk/status/1493698102204719104 <- thought of you, since you dabble in witchcraft

[01:02:26] <brianonymous> mmhmmm
[01:02:46] <MatthiasVance> lz_: Is he on that call for FIVE HOURS??
[01:02:46] <lz_> MatthiasVance: mark rober is the guy using fake packages for them to be stolen on porches i think
[01:02:53] <MatthiasVance> ahh right
[01:03:23] <lz_> MatthiasVance: yes :D it's passing sooooo fast
[01:03:47] <MatthiasVance> lol
[01:03:53] <lz_> MatthiasVance: there's actually a counter on the top right, he counts how much time he spend with each guy
[01:03:59] <lz_> Abel was sth like 10 hours
[01:04:10] <lz_> the all time record was maybe 36 hours I think, maybe more
[01:04:18] <Suchiman> https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/60785 oh boi, do they really dare??? xD
[01:05:36] <lz_> he's so good at manipulating them, sometimes I wonder if he's not an actual psychopath
[01:05:49] <MatthiasVance> lz_: Is this his day job? xD
[01:05:55] <lz_> yes

[01:11:25] <Suchiman> JakeSays: i mean i suppose it's pretty much like watching sports

[01:12:27] <lz_> when you get to know him, you see how he prepares things in advance. Putting story elements here and there he reuses later
[01:12:30] <JakeSays> well, i also don't get the whole concept of facebook.
[01:12:42] <MatthiasVance> Then again 10 hours for 20k is pretty good
[01:13:02] <MatthiasVance> Listen to me Linda, please, please
[01:13:09] <MatthiasVance> He says that 100 times
[01:13:18] <lz_> there was one time he played a psychic. Scammers believe he was an actual psychic and were asking him to do psychic stuff

[01:25:10] <lz_> MatthiasVance: anyway he'll probably edit this into a more watchable youtube video
[01:26:03] <MatthiasVance> Pretty sure I watched another some time and it sounded exactly like this one lol
[01:26:18] <lz_> MatthiasVance: he has a limited number of voices, but characters change
[01:26:43] <MatthiasVance> I mean the interactions xD
[01:27:00] <lz_> well scammers are often indian, so the accents is usually the same
[01:28:27] <MatthiasVance> I don't mean the sounds, I mean the interactions are all the same lol
[01:28:33] <MatthiasVance> But that's because they all try to achieve the same thing
[01:28:45] <MatthiasVance> Get your focus (which he isn't giving) and scam your money (which he isn't)
[01:28:46] <lz_> MatthiasVance: scammers often read the same script, yes
[01:31:09] <MatthiasVance> Suddenly it's 11pm

[01:38:27] <brianonymous> i dont remember, but 88 is my dumpster IIS

[01:41:00] <MatthiasVance> MA'AM
[01:41:56] <lz_> MatthiasVance: lol yes, previous episodes with abel were much more calm, before he realized how much time he invested for nothing
[01:42:24] <lz_> in 10 hours he went from super calm and collected to completely crazy
[01:42:35] <MatthiasVance> I should skip to the ending
[01:43:15] <brianonymous> Suchiman: looks like i was playing with custom error msgs and never finished
[01:43:19] <lz_> i think my favorite parts were the psychotherapy sessions; he was actually giving really good advice :D

[02:19:11] <MatthiasVance> brianonymous: Which parts? https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/why-use-fsharp/
[02:22:00] <teegee> if you have a method MethodAsync() and the last thing you do in that method is to call an async method OtherMethodAsync(), do you make it an async Task MethodAsync { await OtherMethodAsync(); } or do you make it a Task MethodAsync { return OtherMethodAsync(); } ?
[02:22:43] <brianonymous> MatthiasVance: that looks better than other functionals ive looked into
[02:23:32] <lz_> my most recent programming nightmware was using gimp scripts

[02:26:15] <brianonymous> other than my default functional language witchcraft
[02:26:38] <MatthiasVance> I think if you do a direct translation from C# to F# of certain things (but instead of using OO, use FP principles) you end up with a more readable version that's more correct

[02:45:42] <_genuser_> it's sitting in the shelf still. unused. I'm wondering if the thermal paste is still good. lol.
[02:46:16] <_genuser_> the current heatsink fan is making lots of noise. AND AMD installation is much simpler. No need to take out the entire mobo. So I figured this weekend, I'll swap it out.

[04:56:32] <brianonymous> i cant think of a way to do exactly that with just attributes
[04:57:06] <brianonymous> in those cases ive ended up making class models, if the data i need is arranged in an odd way from what the containers are

[16:38:03] <MaNa2k> oki, i compacted a little https://pastebin.com/y1S6pt1C
[16:38:58] <MatthiasVance> Why would you need to adjust the ingested data in any way before mapping it MaNa2k ?

[16:39:56] <MaNa2k> MatthiasVance, well im going to transform the object to a different model which is almost similar but with fewer fields, and ofc the country node moved one level out
[16:40:16] <MatthiasVance> Reusing things that don't mean the same is a bad idea
[16:40:21] <MatthiasVance> Even though they look alike

[16:44:05] <hseg> in particular, var x = new C(); x.A = a; x.B = x.A; gets rewritten into var x = new C { A = a, B = x.A };

[16:45:43] <canton7> hseg, raise that as an issue
[16:45:45] <MaNa2k> MatthiasVance, basically, the provider has 3 models select, add, update). We do a select query, and get json which we map top select-model. then we do some updates the some fields, and transform it to update-model, but here ite structure is slightly different as i explained,
[16:47:02] <MaNa2k> the transformation from mapping of the obj_select => obj_update works for every field except the country due to its nested in the select, and not in the update

[17:56:28] <interop_madness> does anyone know a way in Newtonsoft.Json to deserialize JSON where one of the properties represents a union type, such as this? https://paste.ee/p/hWkpo
[17:56:55] <interop_madness> whoops, should be bar: string[] | string;
[17:56:59] <Suchiman> interop_madness: well depends on what you want the C# property to be
[17:57:16] <Suchiman> C# doesn't support string[] | string obviously
[17:57:24] <interop_madness> Suchiman, I'm fine with the serializer writing the result in C# property A if array and B if string
[17:57:49] <Suchiman> so... object?
[17:57:55] <Suchiman> or always an array with one member?
[17:58:18] <interop_madness> I'd like to restrict it to string[] and string
[17:59:11] <interop_madness> to elaborate, it's a fetch request where I get columns, and I want to keep the requested columns explicit. the caller should have to supply either columns: ["foo", "bar"] or columns: "all"
[17:59:25] <interop_madness> so the TypeScript type would actually be string[] | "all"
[17:59:36] <Suchiman> interop_madness: if in doubt, write a custom https://www.newtonsoft.com/json/help/html/CustomJsonConverter.htm and apply it to the property with [JsonConverter(typeof(MyConverter))]
[18:00:28] <interop_madness> ok, that's what I gathered. I just wanted to make sure Newtonsoft doesn't have anything out-of-the-box for union types

[18:11:20] <interop_madness> irwiss, how would you implement the following requirements which are iron-clad? 1. the column property of the DTO is mandatory, 2. a user must be able to pass several columns as an array, 3. a user must be able to pass that all columns be returned, 4. the column name "all" is perfectly valid, as are probably all other possible names, so ["all"] is not a solution for 3.
[18:12:04] <interop_madness> passing null/undefined for the column property is not an option, because then the property would be optional, and the caller should be forced to think about which columns to request
[18:12:27] <irwiss> multiple columns, definitely not one property with multiple meanings, where one name has special meaning you can only "know" by searching

[18:13:41] <interop_madness> not sure if I understand irwiss, that would be the (invalid) ["all"] solution, no?
[18:15:02] <irwiss> no, add `public bool AllColumns { get; set; }` and you're done, the person trying to understand what's going on later also won't have to decypher that columns: "all" is entirely different from columns: [ "all" ] and the logic for it  is hidden somewhere
[18:16:43] <interop_madness> note that we only need to do deserialization here irwiss, so this could be perfectly clear with the property  columns: string[] : "all"

[18:19:36] <irwiss> interop_madness: i don't propose my opinion as ultimate truth or anything but only as opinion, imo the problem with unions is that you have very low chance to guess the "correct" meaning without jumping through hoops of reading docs/code, which will just slow down future you
[18:20:11] <irwiss> yeah cats have petting behaviours where love bites are a thing, although some dogs also got those

[18:20:55] <interop_madness> irwiss, yeah you're right, speaking from the vantage point where I had to read hundreds of lines of client and server code (TypeScript, C#, C++) as well as DB configuration (3 tables) to understand a particular request/response behavior -.-

[20:57:11] <_genuser_> irwiss do you also include dependency injection in that list?
[20:57:52] <irwiss> dunno i find lightweight DI pretty useful and nice, as long as it's not something made by satan himself like android's hilt and such
[20:59:35] <_genuser_> hehe, I was just looking at a write up or polymorphism via inheritance or composition. And the whole write-up was talking about how people were always sure that inheritance was the way to go. And they created all these examples. And now it's just frowned upon because, well it ends up creating things that are hard to maintain or extend.
[21:00:17] <_genuser_> and I thought, and yet people don't learn from having rigid rules and standards. They have to have the in-vogue design patterns in all the code they write. and be adamant that those design pattern are the only way to write code.

[21:42:48] <Suchiman> indeed!
[21:43:11] <brianonymous> not much luck with that, at least in terms of consistency of performance.. in the limited times i tried that is
[21:43:58] <Nasp> jonp:  It's just kinda too late for that right
[21:44:09] <Nasp> But yeah we should have a day where we all switch to same line endings and encodings
[21:44:29] <Nasp> jonp:  It's just not exactly great to have mixed line endings requirements in the same repo
[21:46:14] <jonp> meh?
[21:46:24] <jonp> pretty sure most of my repos are incredibly inconsistent about everything
[21:47:22] <Nasp> Sure your repo are

[21:47:51] <brianonymous> Suchiman: thats been difficult, too.. and you wont come work for me
[21:47:52] <Suchiman> brianonymous: how much go is that btw. in proportion to C#?
[21:48:19] <Nasp> I dont think there are that many go devs
[21:48:32] <jonp> not compared to C# or Java, no
[21:48:32] <brianonymous> the streaming pipeline itself is almost entirely c#.. ad selection tech has moved to Go.. lots of log parsers in Go...
[21:48:38] <jonp> i imagine there are more Kotlin devs than Goâ€¦
[21:48:54] <brianonymous> we have some nodeJS sprinkled about too
[21:48:54] <Nasp> At my previous workplace we decided to switch everything away from .NET to go
[21:49:00] <Nasp> So i was told i needed to learn Go and get the boot
[21:49:01] <brianonymous> but the consensus is nodeJS is evil
[21:49:03] <Nasp> or get the boot*
[21:49:07] <Suchiman> brianonymous: yuck
[21:49:10] <jonp> Nasp: that's sad
[21:49:19] <Nasp> jonp:  Go and NodeJS instead of .NET :D
[21:49:23] <Nasp> Also that NodeJS stack, shiiiet
[21:49:37] <Nasp> Each NodeJS file in a separate repo
[21:49:42] <Nasp> So 250 repos
[21:49:52] <jonp> wait, what
[21:49:52] <Suchiman> brianonymous: so and how much code is that in proportion :P ? 1:2 ?
[21:50:05] <Suchiman> given that it's go without generics i guess it's 10x as much code :P
[21:50:14] <Nasp> Wasn't go just about to get generics?
[21:50:15] <Suchiman> just to declare collection types :P
[21:50:21] <Nasp> jonp: Well you know the node eco system
[21:50:29] <jonp> Nasp: i believe Go recently got generics
[21:50:30] <Nasp> So many different repos for many of the same things
[21:50:31] <brianonymous> Suchiman: oh man, thats hard to guage.. its soooo many repos.. and the streaming projects are massssive
[21:50:39] <Suchiman> Nasp: they were working on it but i don't think that would mean that brianonymous already has go code that modern :P
[21:51:43] <Suchiman> brianonymous: btw. how much do you ever worry about GC pauses?
[21:52:12] <brianonymous> Suchiman: our egress systems attempt to manage some of that.. ingress it hasnt been a problem at all
[21:53:18] <brianonymous> Suchiman: and things are designed in such a way that if there is a brief pause, data bursts make up for it
[21:53:26] * Suchiman keeps an eye open for concurrent compacting GC's
[21:53:35] <Suchiman> brianonymous: ah neat
[21:53:38] <Suchiman> rubber banding xD
[21:53:59] <brianonymous> yeah.. time measurement is super critical

[22:19:25] <_genuser_> Nasp ime, Software that is great generally never gets used. Because the amount of time it takes is on the high side. The usefulness of a feature goes down the longer it takes to develop the feature. You just get used to alternate processes. Or or your users find something else.
[22:19:36] <Nasp> Did i tell you about one of our product managers?

[22:20:16] <_genuser_> xb0o2 I haven't generally done a lot of code reviews. When I do, I just find it irritating to have to read someone's code. But now and then I can spot issues that they have a code-blindness to. Error strings, some logic they've seen too long and just makes sense to them, etc.

[22:21:19] <xb0o2> It's boring and it's tedious but it's worth it.
[22:21:28] <Nasp> T hen someone had to fix bugs in that for months until they moved it to .NET
[22:21:33] <JakeSays> apparently some theoretical physicist came up with a beautifully elegant equation for the radius of the universe, but he never bothered to actually work it out. years later someone got bored and did work it out - the result was 10cm

[22:22:42] <_genuser_> xb0o2 I would agree also. I have concern A) do I tell someone this is stupid? Is it just personal preference? 4 spaces for TABs? Have you lost your mind? Or Singleton? Again? Really? B). this looks like it would be buggy, but I'd have to write a proof of concept to really prove it. Nevermind whether I've seen it before or not. I should just go

[22:36:36] <MatthiasVance> From looking at the Z-axis of my printer it doesn't look straight ever since it jammed into the bed lol, but it's printing fine xD
[22:37:02] <brianonymous> my next printer, auto level will be manditory
[22:37:16] <_genuser_> first thing I"m printing with that printer is a plaque that says, You're Awesome!
[22:37:21] <_genuser_> a little morale booster
[22:37:40] <JakeSays> i have one auto-level and one manual-level printer, and auto leveling hasn't turned out to matter that much
[22:38:06] <brianonymous> i have to manual relevel at least every 2-3 prints
[22:38:32] <JakeSays> yer printer sucks
[22:38:37] <brianonymous> im an early adopter
[22:38:58] <brianonymous> my poor qidi is now basically ancient
[22:39:26] <JakeSays> brianonymous: upgrade and make something out of that qidi - lots of fun motors, etc
[22:39:41] <brianonymous> that is true
[22:39:49] <MichaelLong> or print yourself a new, better printer
[22:40:03] <MatthiasVance> Shit
[22:40:06] <MatthiasVance> Just ran out of booze
[22:40:10] <JakeSays> lol
[22:40:29] <brianonymous> got some Skrewball in the pantry, help yourself
[22:41:23] <MatthiasVance> We should do a tasting of different kinds then, haven't been properly introduced to whiskey
[22:41:49] <brianonymous> most of it tastes like radiator fluid mixed with camp fire
[22:41:57] <brianonymous> but the skrewball is nice
[22:41:58] <JakeSays> LOL
[22:42:06] <MatthiasVance> haha
[22:42:10] <MatthiasVance> Didn't expect that
[22:42:26] <JakeSays> i like gin neat

[23:01:47] <MatthiasVance> Sounds pointless? xD
[23:05:31] <xb0o2> Well at least it's *an* activity
[23:08:19] <irwiss> get the cheapest vodka, same thing but you don't need to reach a third :P
[23:11:23] <JakeSays> start with a shot of everclear
[23:13:49] <knmae> Vodka is just wine made of potatoes
[23:13:59] <JakeSays> lol
[23:14:58] <xb0o2> We have potato milk now so your daily fluid needs are fully taken care of by them
[23:15:29] <JakeSays> actually no since potatoes aren't cows
[23:15:45] <xb0o2> Oh, dang, they aren't?
[23:16:01] <JakeSays> i dont believe so
[23:16:17] <knmae> if the cow had wheels, it'd be a milk truck
[23:18:01] <DoofusCanadensis> potatoes do benefit from cow manure, though
[23:26:18] <knmae> Milk potatoes, good food

[23:50:55] <lz_> integrity is what you do when no one's watching
[23:53:54] <khanred> masturbate?
[23:54:05] <lz_> khanred: I mean I didn't dare say it
[23:54:18] <khanred> I'll say anything, I ain't give a fuck
[23:54:34] <lz_> you're giving a self fuck
[23:54:44] <khanred> Well nobody else will give me any
[23:54:55] <lz_> I would
[23:55:02] <khanred> thanks
[23:59:30] <khanred> This Kombucha tastes like industrial solvent
