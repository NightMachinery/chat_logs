[01:02:47] <cryptonector> https://linux.die.net/man/1/xsel
[01:02:57] <cryptonector> you know, man pages online is a thing
[01:04:03] <geirha> And sometimes they even happen to correspond to the command you have installed
[01:04:12] <cryptonector> yes!  imagine that
[01:04:22] <cryptonector> somtimes they don't, and then you can be sad
[01:04:29] <zindo> cryptonector: I'm really trying to understand the man pages, but what I get from it, is that the command would put nothing into the selection and then output it, which doesn't make sense. Sorry to bother you I'll find the appropiate channel to ask.
[01:04:34] <cryptonector> in this case, however, it seems to explain
[01:05:04] <cryptonector> zindo: the text in question is hard to parse, yeah
[01:05:34] <earnestly> Though linux.die is quite outdated.  Arch has recently added online manpages which might be better (or any up-to-date distro which hosts them): https://man.archlinux.org/
[01:05:37] <cryptonector> > the selection is set from standard input if standard input is not a terminal
[01:06:26] <cryptonector> so it looks like it's clearing the selection when you say xsel </dev/null... except
[01:06:38] <cryptonector> > If any input or output options are given then the program behaves only in the requested mode.
[01:06:54] <geirha> and manpages.ubuntu.com and manpages.debian.org for ubuntu and debian
[01:07:40] <cryptonector> and -o apparently means "output", so, idk, it's a bit confusing, and you might have to test it, but I think it all means that `xsel -o -p` and `xsel -o -p < /dev/null` should both do the same thing

[23:40:55] <Hazoune> what would be the better variable name for user_password0 and user_password1? it's for confirmation password.
[23:43:03] <twkm> [repeat:] i take most confirmations to be ephemeral and generally use ck.

[23:52:45] <kurahaupo> yates: Your make line comprises two commands separated by a semicolon. The $(MAKE) macro in the first command is special to make, so that make thinks the whole line is a recursive call to itself, so it changes how it counts parallel tasks under -jN
