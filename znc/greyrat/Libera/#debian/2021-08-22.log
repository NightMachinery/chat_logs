[03:05:20] <dpkg> Read (at least) the upgrading chapter of <release notes> https://deb.li/39cyD . TL;DR: In /etc/apt/sources.list change "buster" to "bullseye", fix the line for security updates (see <bullseye-security>), remove stable-specific lines like buster-backports. apt update && apt upgrade && apt full-upgrade. 3rd party repos like <dmo> cause problems with upgrades. If working over ssh, upgrade ssh first, see <bullseye ssh upgrade>.

If you are upgrading over ssh, you may wish to upgrade the openssh-server package first. See https://www.debian.org/releases/bullseye/amd64/release-notes/ch-information.en.html#ssh-not-available

[03:33:29] <enoq> Blondie101010: https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/kj8SFtnXKt/
[03:34:20] <joepublic> that seems to boil down to "connection refused"
[03:34:21] <enoq> jochum: so basically you'd recommend to match all sub domains with their .well-known url and send it to a single directory?
[03:34:35] <jochum> enoq: thats what i do with lots of domains and nginx, yes.
[03:35:05] <jochum> enoq: It will fuckup redirects if you want/need them
[03:35:20] <enoq> I do
[03:35:42] <jochum> enoq: Then I would go for a single file included in every vhost

[03:40:30] <ampersam> did you try cerbot --standalone?
[03:41:01] <enoq> does that spin up a webserver for every domain?
[03:41:13] <Blondie101010> but that'd require shutting down the web server, though it doesn't seem in prod

[05:36:33] <rue_mohr> somiaj, is there an i386 package for the new version of libbabl

[05:52:48] <somiaj> and yea, #debian-mentors if your goal is to get packages into debian, but this is more about the debian workflow than just creating packages
[05:55:28] <codeguru> I'll need to learn proper packaging before considering putting things upstream. I only know how to build code so far, I want to learn packaging properly
[05:55:36] *** Joins: AndrewYu (~andrew@user/andrewyu)
[05:56:27] <Blondie101010> codeguru:  you publish packages?
[05:57:26] <somiaj> codeguru: you might want to start by looking at debian source packages debian/, which can help you see what is needed. Though with debian helper, a lot of stuff is automated (in a simple case, basicly make build system with a single binary packages)
[05:57:49] <codeguru> Blondie101010: I haven't learned how to do that yet. I know how to write code, though. I work at a large company and the code happens to be GPL'd so I'd consider putting it upstream so it can be installed on our other machines.
[05:57:58] <somiaj> codeguru: but the new maintainers guide should give you a brief tutorial on making a debian package, I would start there.
[05:58:42] <Blondie101010> codeguru:  even though it's GPL, I'd ask my boss first
[05:59:22] <codeguru> Can I ask you right here - how do source packages get converted into binary ones? And yeah, I already did.
[05:59:26] <sney> yeah, the nmg's walkthrough is how I learned debian packaging. it helps to really follow the example
[06:00:10] <sney> well, you go into the source tree, type 'debuild' and a lot of automated steps happen that produce the binary package(s) from the source package.
[06:00:11] <Blondie101010> codeguru:  they get built with tools such as automake, make, linker, compiler
[06:00:18] <sney> dpkg: debian/rules
[06:00:19] <dpkg> debian/rules is the makefile used when building a .deb from source, edit it to change compilation options.  Some packages use sophisticated build systems that should be documented in debian/README.source.  Also remember to make a new entry in debian/changelog with "~yourname" (for a backport) or "+yourname" (for a recompile) added to the version number.  See also <makefile>, <hold>, <package recompile>, <source>, <unique package version>.
[06:01:01] <sney> there isn't really "one" way that a source package becomes a binary deb so it's hard to answer the question in general. 
[06:01:11] <Blondie101010> true
[06:01:36] <sney> but basically, it runs the upstream build system, and then does ~other stuff~ that converts the build output into debian packages separated by purpose 
[06:01:49] <codeguru> Is there a convention with how binary packages get built along with -dev packages as part of the same autotools/project?
[06:01:51] <sney> sometimes applying patches in the middle somewhere, etc 
[06:02:17] <Blondie101010> codeguru:  -dev packages are to build other packages with
[06:02:24] <sney> yes, absolutely. -dev packages from the same source tree as the main package and -common, -doc, etc are all built at the same time 
[06:02:29] <Blondie101010> not something a regular user would do
[06:03:44] <codeguru> Right, I know that part. -dev packages are used for extending the functionality of something (they contain the APIs of the project and allows for static/dynamic linking etc). But I don't know how to go about this distinction in a standard way or if a standard protocol for this distinction even exists...
[06:03:53] *** Quits: festerdam (~polas@185.51.93.165) (Quit: leaving)
[06:04:32] <sney> codeguru: you should look at debian policy, the section on 'control' files. it explains what debian considers the important distinctions and how to decide which files go in which package 
[06:04:40] <Blondie101010> codeguru:  can you tell us anything about your project?
[06:06:02] <codeguru> Well, we use autotools to build it. We are converting it to a cmake project. I know cmake can build deb packages but I can't separate the -dev and binary builds in either one
[06:06:26] <sney> you don't need to separate the builds, you use d/rules to separate the output after the build
[06:06:28] <somiaj> codeguru: note, I would first wory about packaging before some of the more detailed parts of policy, but the libfoo contains the compiled libaries, .so, and libfoo-dev contains the headers to link against those libaries, .h
[06:07:14] <somiaj> codeguru: yea, you don't often need to change the upstream build proces, the debian package process can split the files out into multiple packages when needed (and often debianhelper can detect a lot of this and do the work for you if your automake/cmake/etc are decent)
[06:07:23] <codeguru> somiaj: That's good - I'll bookmark it. What page did you say was the libfoo example?
[06:07:29] <sney> autotools and cmake are both very common in the archive, and there are debhelper bits for both of them, if your system is sane it'll mostly be automatic

[06:10:27] <codeguru> Ok. I'll read that manual. Thanks!
[06:10:39] <somiaj> codeguru: 'foo' is just often a placekeper, I was just pointing out libfoo vs libfoo-dev, one contains the complied .so libs, the other the develoment headers, .h, to link against
[06:11:32] <codeguru> Oh ok. yeah if I can have an end-to-end example that'll probably help me understand it best as I learn most when actually doing things as opposed to just reading documentation about it.
[06:11:43] <Blondie101010> direct and precise answer...  you just separate the headers from the rest
[06:12:04] <sney> and then the rest is just arch:any vs arch:all

[12:42:05] <jaguart> IMHO packages.debian.org should have a search for system-created accounts, and there should be a register
[12:42:50] <PMT> Mayhaps, but do you only include accounts that are created by a package, or accounts used by a package if present, or both, or neither?
[12:43:33] <jaguart> I would go for created - the package then is assuming responsibility, used-by would be extra for a gold star
[12:43:45] <PMT> Plus, I don't know if there's any guidelines, say, forbidding a package from generating user accounts while running, e.g. ftp-user1, ftp-user2, etc, so those wouldn't turn up unless you did far more fascinating analysis.

[13:07:42] <willow> jelly: thanks
[13:10:36] <jelly> willow, I can get to that font with dpkg-reconfigure console-setup, on buster: Encoding... UTF-8 -> Character set... - Combined Latin; Slavic Cyrillic; Greek -> Font for the console -> TerminusBold -> Font size 16x32 (framebuffer only)
[13:10:48] <willow> something goes really wrong when i ctrl-alt-f2 to a linux console.  i see a lot of odd stuff in syslog such as "Freezing user space processes ... (elapsed 0.002 seconds) done."
[13:11:05] <willow> "Freezing remaining freezable tasks ... "
[13:11:23] <willow> "sd 2:0:0:0: [sda] Stopping disk"
[13:11:55] <PMT> that seems like you may have hit a hibernate shortcut
[13:12:09] <willow> everything goes blank.  sound that is playing in an X session stutters then stops.  then eventually starts again.  eventually the console comes up and I can log in.  then it goes blank again.  sound stutters, etc.  then it comes back again...

[13:14:21] <PMT> (or, if it's not a laptop, what model keyboard?)
[13:15:41] <jelly> willow, does it happen if you do "chvt 2" as root (or "sudo chvt 2") from X, instead of the key combo?
[13:16:23] <jelly> if it does not, then it could be something you press on keyboard also triggers a sleep (suspend) acpi action
[13:17:11] <willow> this log contains several times that ctrl-alt-f2 was pressed and then ctrl-alt-f6 to go back to X session.  http://paste.debian.net/1208552/
[13:18:24] <willow> jelly: it is a thinkpad compact USB keyboard and f2 Fn key is mapped to volume down but that requires Fn-F2 to activate it
[13:18:57] <jelly> willow, did you switch Fn and Ctrl in BIOS at some point?

[13:24:47] <willow> "chvt 2" behavior is identical to ctrl-alt-f2 - sound stutters then stops, screen blanks.  after about 20-30 secs the console finally comes up...
[13:24:58] * PMT learned this when he had a problem with his thinkpad display eating it until it got reset by susp/res or hibernate or poweroff...)
[13:25:09] <PMT> willow: did you ever pastebin the logs?
[13:25:20] <willow> PMT: i think you may be right.  suspend Fn key used to be F4
[13:25:34] <willow> PMT: yes: http://paste.debian.net/1208552/
[13:25:35] <PMT> willow: oh i know that fn-4 is right. I just tried it and everything.
[13:26:10] <willow> PMT: that paste contains a couple times that ctrl-alt-f2 was pressed, then ctrl-alt-f6, then ctrl-alt-f2 again...
[13:27:09] <PMT> yeah it's triggering suspend
[13:27:11] <PMT> how fascinating
[13:27:46] <willow> 😮
[13:30:55] <PMT> does it trigger immediately on switching console, or only after you log in on the console

[14:56:41] <mrfb> i3 dwm right?
[14:56:42] <Khepra> aaii: your screenshot shows xfce panel at the top and what appears to be stacked i3-wm windows under it
[14:56:45] <jelly> aaii, I'd use compton with xfce until debian 9 to 10, because xfce's compositor was relying on some old software-based thing.  Have not tried debian 11 yet.
[14:56:45] <aaii> mrfb, Yup , It's ok when i use xfce
[14:57:11] <aaii> Khepra, dude , It's not mine , I just showed it's look like my problem too.

[14:59:56] <mrfb> My bet is on some bug on the compositors
[15:00:08] <Khepra> yes.
[15:00:23] <mrfb> that kind of noise is either hardware failire or rendering failure due software

[19:02:17] <Kingsy> can someone link me to the latest debian server iso? I find the download section of the website... confusing.
[19:02:32] <Khepra> Kingsy: which one?
[19:02:53] <Kingsy> oh I think I found it.
[19:03:05] <Khepra> if you click the big, huge Download button on debian.org you get the amd64 netinst which is, like, one of gold standards
[19:03:10] <joepublic> if you have amd64, it should be pretty easy to find, yeah
[19:03:21] <Kingsy> https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/iso-cd/debian-11.0.0-amd64-netinst.iso <- is this correct if I want a headless no DE install?
[19:03:24] <Khepra> there is no "server" vs "desktop" ISO, unless you mean "live CD/ISO" as "desktop", which is something else
[19:03:44] <n4dir> Kingsy: any downloadable iso would do that.

[19:06:01] <xx> Khepra: gone from tasksel
[19:06:09] <Khepra> very nice.
[19:06:25] <xx> was indeed very confusing
[19:06:29] <alex11> i actually love how debian doesn't have a server iso
[19:06:36] <alex11> it's the universal operating system :D
[19:06:49] <xx> who even *installs* debian on servers?
[19:07:10] <xx> i.e. actually going through the installer
[19:07:31] <joepublic> depends on the server I would suppose
[19:08:00] <Khepra> definitely. I installed just one few weeks ago
[19:08:42] <joepublic> I do confess that it's often a case of telling the VPS provider to use the debian image, then tailoring it to the needs of the server
[19:09:18] <Khepra> for remote installations I use custom debootstrap based scripts. occasionally, for a local machine, I'd use the installer
[19:10:00] *** Joins: expert975 (~expert975@user/expert975)
[19:10:09] <jelly> xx, all Debian VMs at $work are installed via d-i.  netboot, preseed.  VM is provisioned, d-i does its thing, then it's configured some more.
[19:10:46] <n4dir> perhaps the term "server" is a bit too broad
[19:11:26] <jelly> I don't have automated provisioning for bare metal, but it'd be very similar
[19:11:59] <xx> jelly: using preseed is not actually "going through the installer" the way I meant it though
[19:12:17] <xx> but I recognize what I said was inaccurate
[19:12:22] <Khepra> n4dir: which is why "server" vs "nonserver" ISOs make very little sense
[19:12:59] <jelly> xx, I still want to install it manually once or twice or when things have changed.
[19:13:05] <Khepra> for example, I have a machine that's, by some standards, pure server. no xorg, headless. it "serves" VMs with desktop-y access, VNC and local hardware KVM (keyboard, video, mouse) connections
[19:13:15] <jelly> or when I don't have automated provisioning
[19:13:33] <jelly> Khepra, that's a VDI server.

[19:14:21] <jelly> wait, what does "local hardware KVM (keyboard, video, mouse) connections", local to client or local to server

[19:14:46] <Khepra> jelly: local to the "server"
[19:15:03] <jelly> that's just a multiseat done with VMs
[19:15:13] <Khepra> well see that's why strict labels suck
[19:15:40] <jelly> you're serving workstation functions
[19:15:43] <Khepra> it is what it is. to me it's a server because I'm oldschool.  To some, a server is even running GNOME on some Hetzner three ninenty nine VPS.
[19:16:33] <Khepra> jelly: precisely. serving workstation functions, remotely or "locally", is why I think of it as a server
[19:17:15] <jelly> how many seats do you need to have before it switches from workstation to server? 2? 3?
[19:17:24] <ansgar> Khepra: 3.99 is already an expensive VPS :>
[19:17:56] <Khepra> ansgar: nah. just because 0.99/yr scamware exists on lowendbox dot com, does not make 3.99 cheap in any meaning

[22:51:35] <willow> disabling framebuffer is harder than i thought.  i thought uncommenting "GRUB_TERMINAL=console" in /etc/default/grub would work but no.  then I tried to append CMDLINE with "video=vesafb:off,efifb:off" also not working.  now trying to see if there's a way via initramfs to disable fb

[23:09:01] <willow> when i set "GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="text vga=normal nofb nomodeset usbcore.autosuspend=-1""  in /etc/default/grub; run "update-grub"; and reboot I can tell that the Linux console is still in framebuffer mode because the characters are very crisp and not fuzzy, and also because of nvidia the system goes through power suspend 
[23:09:22] <willow> also have "GRUB_TERMINAL=console" in /etc/default/grub
[23:11:49] <willow> also tried the grub method here to disable fb but also didn't work: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GRUB/Tips_and_tricks#Disable_framebuffer
[23:12:13] <xx> ^-^hi: why use ttyrec instead of asciinema?
[23:12:49] <^-^hi> xx: isn't that just a player for what ttyrec records?
[23:12:56] <xx> no
[23:13:12] <^-^hi> will try it.
[23:13:26] <xx> it is superior to script and ttyrec, at least in my opinion
[23:13:42] <^-^hi> i was just asking someone to check out why a certain command doesn't work with ttyrec
[23:14:06] <xx> probably because ttyrec has not seen an update at least since jessie
