[14:52:39] <amigojapan> flows dodwn your body
[14:52:54] <amigojapan> I hope I expplained  it well
[14:54:39] <evolv> no, that makes sense
[14:55:10] <amigojapan> ah good good
[14:55:39] <amigojapan> evolv: since it involves outter space it must be modern
[14:55:41] <evolv> that's like a brahmavihara meditation
[14:55:51] <amigojapan> ah ok
[14:55:53] <evolv> and emptiness meditation
[14:56:11] <brigand> "amigojapan: evolv: since it involves outter space it must be modern" hehe
[14:56:11] <evolv> they're very similar in style, in a brahamavihara, you radiate metta
[14:56:40] <evolv> empitness meditation is similar, except you're removing the essence of things
[14:56:45] <pussipupu> tea time is a good thing
[14:56:46] <amigojapan> what is metta?
[14:56:52] <evolv> good will/loving-kindness
[14:57:16] <brigand> abed is radiating meta
[14:57:30] <evolv> you radiate metta in all directions to all beings, you start with yourself, people you care about, people around you, the entire world, throughout space, throughout dimensions, etc.
[14:57:39] <amigojapan> pussipupu: yeah , and even tho it invols tea, they dont really charge money for the meditation session
[14:57:53] <evolv> emptiness meditaiton is like doing that but without spreading metta
[14:58:08] <evolv> you radiate out, but remove elements from your mental eye
[14:58:10] <amigojapan> I see evolv
[14:58:13] <evolv> it's neat
[14:59:03] <amigojapan> evolv: you are alsos told that that pure drop of water cleanses your body form stress and anger
[14:59:24] <amigojapan> I guess that is the point of it
[14:59:38] <evolv> stress is dukkha
[14:59:50] <evolv> anger is vyapada/byapada, usually (ill will)
[14:59:56] <evolv> there are the five hindrances
[15:00:10] <evolv> the five hindrances prevent jhana/dyhana factors
[15:01:23] <evolv> sensual desires, ill will, dullness, restlessness, doubt

[15:04:49] <evolv> amigojapan, do you guys go to temple?
[15:04:58] <mrig> brigand: why? It is philosophy.
[15:05:28] <brigand> not really
[15:05:43] <evolv> Buddhism isn't philosophy
[15:05:55] <amigojapan> I just do buddhism to get distracted, I am nto really a buddhist, enitehr does the monk try to convert me
[15:06:14] <evolv> Buddhism inspired philosophy
[15:06:21] <mrig> I'm not talking about budha, budha is a planet, that is cosmology.
[15:07:33] <Thelma> Groundhog day is a good movie some say might be a good analogy of Buddhism
[15:07:40] <evolv> amigojapan, yeah, active converting is against the practice
[15:07:42] <mrig> best look up buddha in sanskrit before going on to read the pali translations that were made perhaps?
[15:07:47] <brigand> evolv: your chat frequently delve into religion. so you are distracting the channel
[15:07:52] <evolv> amigojapan, it's very much a passive missionary religion, though
[15:07:56] <mrig> to know what buddhism is to some.
[15:08:12] <evolv> brigand, deal with it
[15:08:28] <mrig> brigand: your beliefs seem to be quite dogmatic?
[15:08:37] <mrig> your religion.
[15:08:38] <evolv> brigand, I don't talk to you you about religion, so it's not your problem
[15:09:03] <brigand> at least you recognise it
[15:09:08] <mrig> religion is a latin rooted word not sanskrit.
[15:09:28] <mrig> sanskrit is a superb language for philosophy.
[15:09:35] <mrig> and science.
[15:09:45] <evolv> mrig, the earliest Buddhist texts are in pali
[15:10:15] <mrig> evolv: these are aural traditions though.
[15:10:24] <evolv> the oral tradition was in pali
[15:10:44] <evolv> hence the texts were originally transcribed, under Asoka's direction, in Pali
[15:11:35] <Thelma> He sort of keeps being reborn like Samsara until he reaches enlightenment. He does spiritual labour to get there and leave his ego and selfishness behind, he reaches nirvana when he loves Rita. üòÜ
[15:11:39] <mrig> not convinced by that theory, but could be wrong :)
[15:11:45] <Thelma> Or it is just a cool and funny movie
[15:11:54] <evolv> it's uncontroversial, mrig
[15:12:08] <mrig> sure
[15:12:17] <mrig> kind of aside from the point.
[15:12:58] <evolv> I don't understand the point
[15:14:24] <mrig> i'm more of an astika slant myself.
[15:14:43] <mrig> but of course there are many different schools of philosophy.
[15:14:47] <Thelma> What is that mrig ?
[15:15:36] <mrig> Thelma: means that I accept sound as being the fundamentally aspect of reality.

[15:16:52] <evolv> astika now makes sense of the sanskrit
[15:16:55] <mrig> astika and nastika are often translated as being theist or atheist, but this is really a very poor translation.
[15:16:58] <amigojapan> I just go with "nobody really knows what happens after you die"
[15:17:41] <evolv> that, and Mahayana traditions and some early Buddhist schools pre-mahayana (or at least one)

[15:24:34] <mrig> yes

[15:28:17] <amigojapan> Lumine: there cant be any evidence
[15:28:20] <assan> no i didn't convince myself amigojapan, i just don't care about it, whether it exists or not, when i get there i would know
[15:28:26] <brigand> being agnostic is kinda lazy
[15:28:55] <amigojapan> assan: alright, I care abotu the future, and if there is any future after that I woud like to know
[15:29:06] <mrig> evolv are you highlighting the crack between the sthika?
[15:29:12] <Lumine> And yeah, I haven't convinced myself one way or the other
[15:29:12] <amigojapan> brigand: its the only reasonable position
[15:29:18] <mrig> yes this is the root of all things.
[15:29:21] <assan> why do you care about the future so much? amigojapan
[15:29:27] <brigand> amigojapan: not really
[15:29:35] <Thelma> Some agnostics might do a lot of work studying many religions and still decide they can't know for sure
[15:29:39] <amigojapan> assan: cause I have suffered quite a bit already
[15:29:41] <evolv> mrig, I'm not sure what you mean
[15:30:03] <amigojapan> brigand: what other position do you consider reasonable?
[15:30:04] <evolv> amigojapan, we an know if rebirth is true and other dimensions other than this sensual realm
[15:30:29] <assan> i don't understand the correlation between suffering and care for the future amigojapan, can you expound more please
[15:30:34] *** Joins: Vyst (~nk@user/Vyst)
[15:30:37] <amigojapan> evolv: as i told hte others, I will wait till teh evidence comes in, which would likely be after i die
[15:31:03] <evolv> amigojapan, that is its own discussion as acceptable forms of evidence
[15:31:04] <brigand> amigojapan: there's no evidence for afterlife. period.
[15:31:06] <amigojapan> assan: I dont want to suffer in the future, or do as much to avoid suffering as possible
[15:31:13] <mrig> evolv: Knowledge of any divisions limits and of the whole, are essential in approaching learning; I don't see where the issues is. This is how language is formed.
[15:31:14] <evolv> brigand, there are
[15:31:26] <amigojapan> brigand: that does nto  mean it is not true, that is why I am agnostic
[15:31:44] <amigojapan> brigand:evidence is not what makes something ture or false
[15:31:57] <amigojapan> brigand: or lack there of it
[15:32:00] <brigand> amigojapan: it does for atheists
[15:32:24] <mrig> brigand: there is no evidence that there is not either. Now there is evidence for the neuroepigenome, I wonder how might I express that in a way that is easy to understand?
[15:32:47] <mrig> so that a dimwit will grok the importance.
[15:32:49] <evolv> brigand, scientific evidence, but that's a debate, too. Despite studies into the matter, the evidence aren't accepted by the scientific community as a whole. Is it because the studies have weak evidence, or is it because of the physicalist paradigm of science?
[15:32:51] <amigojapan> brigand: most atheists are reallly just agnostics, even richard doawkins does not put himself in his own scale at the total denyal of a god by any future evidence
[15:33:13] <assan> and you don't also want to suffer after you die too? amigojapan
[15:33:17] <evolv> specifically, the bias of physicalism in Western science
[15:33:27] <amigojapan> assan: correct
[15:33:28] <evolv> that arose from modernity
[15:33:39] * assan laughs 
[15:34:00] <mrig> proof has be proven to be inconclusive.
[15:34:05] <amigojapan> assan: you may laugh all you want, but who laughs last laghs best
[15:34:15] <mrig> just another leaf on another branch.
[15:34:19] <amigojapan> assan: if materialism is correct I have nothing to lose
[15:34:23] <mrig> or fruit.
[15:34:33] <evolv> amigojapan, that's not true
[15:34:46] <amigojapan> evolv: what is not true?
[15:34:46] <assan> you trying to guilt trip me now
[15:34:55] <amigojapan> no I am not assan
[15:34:57] <evolv> amigojapan, never mind
[15:35:07] <evolv> I misunderstood why you said that
[15:35:13] <assan> and who said anything about materialism
[15:35:17] <assan> amigojapan did you suffer before you were born?
[15:35:32] <amigojapan> assan:what other options are there?
[15:35:43] <amigojapan> assan: not that i can remember
[15:35:56] <assan> am sure you can't remember lol
[15:36:00] <evolv> in, at minimum, Buddhism, amigojapan did suffer before his rebirth
[15:36:10] <assan> options as in? amigojapan
[15:36:29] <evolv> mrig, "limits and of the whole"
[15:36:34] <amigojapan> assan: as in the other options besides materialism
[15:36:54] <evolv> mrig, can you rephrase? I think I understand what you are saying, but not sure
[15:36:55] <amigojapan> assan: for example the world could be a simulation
[15:37:24] <assan> if there's really an afterlife amigojapan would this be applicable to only beings in earth or all beings in existence?
[15:37:47] <amigojapan> assan:nobody really knows, neither do I
[15:38:17] <amigojapan> assan: anyone claiming to know is passing hte boundries of the actually knowable
[15:38:36] <assan> amigojapan i don't have to be a materialist to dismiss my afterlife ideas, i know there's a mystic aspect to life am just saying it's of no use considering life after death
[15:39:09] <amigojapan> assan: explain the mystic part please
[15:39:31] <evolv> amigojapan, that's not a useful argument. The same can be said of an external reality
[15:39:51] <amigojapan> evolv: right
[15:40:02] <evolv> we all know we can't disprove solipsism
[15:40:04] <mrig> evolv: I am referring to kala and kali here, kala is the void, the entirety of nothing, kali is the injection of energy into that nothingness that begins it division into being, bhavana manifesting.
[15:40:20] <amigojapan> evolv: I take with a grain of salt anything that is not evident to me as of yet
[15:40:31] <amigojapan> evolv: opinions are all over the place
[15:40:52] <mrig> evolv: the greatest limit upon the whole being that it is nothing with out its divisions.
[15:40:58] <assan> the mystic part is the fact i have a material body and you know this immaterial aspect that corresponds to it amigojapan, and being an african i have seen cases where someone slaps an individual spiritually and the person falls to the ground and cannot stand up till some weird things like getting the urine of an old woman are done before the person can stand up
[15:42:07] <amigojapan> assan: sounds weird to me, but I believ you have seen it
[15:42:10] <assan> and amigojapan saying there's an afterlife is really implicating because that would mean we are in an afterlife presently amigojapan you understand this right?
[15:42:38] <evolv> amigojapan, that's what jhana aids in: making the truth evident to yourself :)
[15:42:46] <amigojapan> assan:no, I amlso saying "we dont know if htere is any afterlife, we dont know eihter way"
[15:42:56] <amigojapan> assan: I did nto say there is an afterlife
[15:43:04] <assan> okay i understand
[15:43:05] <amigojapan> assan: I explicitly said I am an agnostic
[15:43:12] <amigojapan> alright
[15:43:17] <assan> my contention is forget the afterlife
[15:43:28] <assan> it's a waste of contemplation
[15:43:31] <amigojapan> assan: that is hard for me
[15:43:33] <evolv> mrig, it is unclear to me what subject we are on. I don't adhere to Vedic thought
[15:43:53] <assan> well good things don't come easy
[15:43:57] <mrig> evolv: bhavana is tantric buddhim also.
[15:44:06] <mrig> as is kalachakra.
[15:44:06] <assan> and also agnostic is bad for business amigojapan
[15:44:17] <assan> you have to choose
[15:44:19] <amigojapan> assan: business?
[15:44:20] <evolv> I practice within the Theravada school, mrig
[15:44:45] <assan> you heard me amigojapan, very bad for the business of knowledge and wisdom
[15:44:46] <amigojapan> assan: I never claimed ot be good at business, nor is it a priority I give
[15:44:53] <mrig> this is all very close to buddhims, I'm kashmire shavite myself really if I had to wear a teeshirt.
[15:44:55] <evolv> Buddha stayed away from metaphysics
[15:45:23] <evolv> it's not close to the Theravada school
[15:45:24] <amigojapan> assan: even socrates said "the only thing i know is that I knwo nothing" I am nto in a business of knowladge
[15:45:32] <mrig> evolv: oh that is cool, yes there are quite a few sects within buddha traditions.
[15:45:35] <amigojapan> assan: being usre about what is not knowable is not knowladge
[15:45:48] <amigojapan> sure*
[15:45:57] <amigojapan> brb abthroom
[15:46:02] <amigojapan> bathroom*
[15:46:05] <assan> ohh don't worry about your typos
[15:46:05] <mrig> which do differ quite a lot, so far as I'm aware.
[15:46:11] <evolv> mrig, Vajrayana traditions are what I think you refer to
[15:46:17] <assan> if i don't understand i would let you know
[15:46:45] <assan> amigojapan their's pride in atheism
[15:46:59] <assan> don't be scared to take up the banner
[15:47:16] <assan> sitting on the fence don't make you any cooler
[15:47:39] <evolv> the Theravada abhidhamma and the commentaries, including Buddhaghosa's, in Theravada get more into the nature of reality
[15:48:30] <evolv> I'm not well versed in those areas, mainly because of emphasis of practice in the Kammatthana tradition within Theravada that I'm most influenced by
[15:48:40] <mrig> evolv: I see, thank you for the pointer. Yes I am learning about the philosophy of pratibhimbavada and how to live within a society with and understanding of the cosmos in this light.
[15:48:42] <amigojapan> assan:richard dawkins is an atheist right? have you read the god delusion? he does nto rank himself as a total ahtiest
[15:48:59] <amigojapan> assan: or are you saying you are more atheist than him?
[15:49:11] <amigojapan> assan: pride is not a reason to believe something
[15:49:21] <assan> i see
[15:49:23] <assan> haha
[15:49:31] <amigojapan> assan: that owuld just be dogmatism

[15:49:34] <assan> you don't want some pride huh
[15:49:40] <amigojapan> no
[15:49:46] <assan> i see
[15:49:47] <amigojapan> I want to be humble
[15:49:52] <assan> mhmm
[15:49:59] <assan> like quasi moto
[15:50:13] <assan> but that aside
[15:50:18] <amigojapan> assan: I have been wrong enough times in 44 years to know I shoudl be humble
[15:50:29] <assan> i see
[15:50:42] <assan> the humble Japanese
[15:50:44] <evolv> mrig, in the suttas, Buddha explicitly discouraged metaphysics and pursuit of knowledge there
[15:51:06] <evolv> the goal directed to cessation of stress, the path to its cessation
[15:51:07] <assan> well
[15:51:07] <amigojapan> assan: I am mexican, but I have lived in Japan for 20 years
[15:51:17] <assan> hmmm
[15:51:30] <assan> thanks for the correction
[15:51:54] <amigojapan> I ahve actually lived in Japahn 1 year mor than I lived in Mexico, cause I lived 5 years in teh US
[15:52:00] <evolv> the knowledge to gain is the understanding of the relationships between anicca (inconstancy, impermanence), anatta (not-self, non-self), and dukkha (stress, suffering)
[15:52:32] <mrig> evolv: in what sense are you using metaphysics, I we talking mathematics here?
[15:52:39] <assan> why do you brag about being agnostic? so much, you think it's something cool?
[15:52:55] <evolv> mrig, metaphysics as in the nature of reality
[15:52:57] <amigojapan> assan:no
[15:53:07] <amigojapan> assan: why do you think ti is bragging?
[15:53:11] <assan> okay so why are you so bold about it
[15:53:25] <assan> because you keep saying am agnostic
[15:53:28] <mrig> evolv: I am not fond of some of the Vajrayana Buddhist beliefs and there are some quite strong distinctions between the philosophise of kasmire and those of buddhism.
[15:53:37] <assan> you said it like 3 times already
[15:53:39] <amigojapan> assan: it is simply the position I find myself holding at the moment waiting for futher evidence
[15:53:42] <mrig> I am not buddhist.
[15:53:51] <assan> evidence of?
[15:54:15] <mrig> evolv: the universe teaches me the nature of reality, I do not really need any scripture for that.
[15:54:22] <evolv> mrig, I can't speak for other schools and whether or not they go into metaphysics at all
[15:54:26] <amigojapan> assan: probably cause I am facing bother people that want me to take an atheisstic or materialistic position but i ouwld say the same thing to people who want me to join a religion
[15:54:48] <amigojapan> agnosticism is nto taking any side
[15:55:01] <assan> i see
[15:55:16] <assan> well maybe you don't know atheism well
[15:55:39] <amigojapan> I know it is the lack of belief in a God
[15:55:53] <amigojapan> nothing else
[15:56:04] <assan> okay do you understand that statement?
[15:56:10] <amigojapan> yes
[15:56:28] <amigojapan> I dont take ither side, I dont knwo if there is a God or not
[15:56:50] <assan> please tell me what you think about "lack of belief in god"
[15:56:58] <mrig> evolv: yours is a wonderful path, one of the major precepts of kashmire shavism is its acceptance of all schools of philosophy.
[15:57:29] <amigojapan> assan: I think it is a position  that can be takjen by some people, but not osmething I am forced to embrace
[15:57:40] <amigojapan> assan: I am just waiting for futher evidence
[15:57:54] <assan> well you not responding to the argument

[15:58:09] <assan> you projecting people did this and this that

[15:59:53] <evolv> mrig, I'm pretty sure it is
[16:00:11] <assan> if yes then, do you understand atheists are not saying there's no god? amigojapan
[16:00:36] <amigojapan> assan: they are only saying they dont believe in God
[16:01:05] <mrig> evolv: well perhaps you still have more to learn about nature then?
[16:01:09] <assan> yes but do you understand what that statement implies?
[16:01:18] <evolv> mrig, ok, I looked it up, they're both non-dual, but you're right that Kashmir Shaivism is not a tradition of the Advaita Vedanta
[16:01:29] <amigojapan> assan: is atheist is right, I will just pass away in peace

[16:10:58] <mrig> ashtangayoga is very similar to the notion of the eight fold path.
[16:11:00] <amigojapan> assan: where did you get that idea form?
[16:11:08] <evolv> mrig, yoga arose much later in Buddhism
[16:11:23] <assan> so asking me to seek people's opinion is funny, in a world of 98 percent globalists
[16:11:37] <mrig> evolv: there is no reason to believe this that I can see.
[16:11:54] <mrig> evolv: on in buddhism pehaps yes, but not in samkya.
[16:11:55] <evolv> no mention of yoga at all in any of the early Buddhists texsts
[16:12:06] <mrig> s/on/oh/
[16:12:07] <ro-bot-o> mrig meant to say: evolv: oh in buddhism pehaps yes, but not in samkya.
[16:12:58] <assan> what idea? amigojapan
[16:13:15] <mrig> yoga means joining, closing of a division.
[16:13:37] <mrig> no reason that any one word such as union would get any mention.
[16:13:40] <evolv> even when we consider jhana (dhyana), we can only be certain that the formless jhanas were known in Buddha's time

[16:15:01] <evolv> Buddha existed
[16:15:13] <evolv> he was born a human
[16:15:15] <mrig> but that is greek injection.
[16:15:24] <evolv> that's nonsense
[16:15:35] <mrig> came with the scripts at the time of Ashoka.
[16:15:57] <evolv> the oral tradition existed long before
[16:15:57] <mrig> now the grammar, which is the most important aspect, was already there.
[16:16:04] <mrig> sure yes.
[16:16:13] <mrig> samkya was the initiation.
[16:16:30] <mrig> if there was samyoga then further teaching was undertaken.
[16:16:41] <mrig> seems pretty logical to me.

[16:19:49] <amigojapan> assan: Idoubt the ansestors used the word "atheist"
[16:19:57] <mrig> Just stressing the importance of grammar in the aural philosophical traditions.
[16:20:26] <mrig> evolv: the name buddha is a word in sanskrit that is composed from phonological building blocks.
[16:20:27] <amigojapan> assan: I am no strannger to anssestor worship, I live in Japan
[16:20:28] *** Joins: Blankspace (~androirc@user/blankspace)
[16:20:33] <evolv> mrig, Buddha is the name he's often referred to. He referred to himself as the tathagata
[16:21:14] <mrig> sanskrit again, the meaning is similar.
[16:21:18] <evolv> mrig, his simile of the fire, nibbana is the blowing out of the flame
[16:21:26] <assan> aren't ancestors these beings that live in our minds amigojapan
[16:21:34] <Blankspace> Are you all worried about escalating war between Russia and Ukraine
[16:21:44] <assan> but where do i get the idea from?
[16:21:48] <evolv> the meaning is supposed to be evidence of what?
[16:21:49] <amigojapan> assan: they liev in our blood for sure
[16:22:02] <assan> the word alone tells you amigojapan
[16:22:12] <assan> lack of theism
[16:22:26] <amigojapan> assan: you are a theist, you believe in God
[16:22:49] <assan> i don't believe in anything but myself amigojapan
[16:22:53] <Blankspace> Whenever belief in God decreases war occurs
[16:22:56] <amigojapan> assan: even if you are not obedient to a God
[16:23:27] <amigojapan> Blankspace:no, yu odnt get it, he is calling himself an atheist , that KNOW God exists
[16:23:37] <Blankspace> Also there is increase in fear
[16:23:47] <Blankspace> As prayers decrease
[16:24:04] <amigojapan> assan: either that or you are just totally illogical,I cant tell
[16:24:29] <assan> amigojapan this is advanced wisdom anyways
[16:24:30] <mrig> evolv: this seems to have the same meaning in sanskrit.
[16:24:31] <Blankspace> That's often said in mythological stories
[16:24:37] <mrig> which would make sense.
[16:24:40] <evolv> mrig, as a planet?
[16:24:43] <assan> i don't expect you to see it at once
[16:25:02] <amigojapan> ok assan
[16:25:24] <evolv> mrig, assuming Buddha is derived frm budha, which I'm skeptical of, looking into "budha," I believe the earliest records of it being a planet are in the 5th century
[16:25:48] <mrig> evolv: the word for planet in sanskrit is grahana which means that which grabs or clasps at you.
[16:26:14] <evolv> and?
[16:26:20] <mrig> sure, they are grahana not planets.
[16:26:49] <mrig> you can see them with the naked eye, five of them which are reflected by the mahatattva.
[16:26:50] <amigojapan> assan: also I remember 2 generations of my ansestors
[16:26:59] <assan> okay
[16:27:13] <assan> they live in us amigojapan
[16:27:15] <amigojapan> assan: at keast at one point they existed
[16:27:37] <amigojapan> assan: yeah they left their DNA inside ours
[16:27:51] <amigojapan> assan: so I kind of agree with that
[16:28:06] <evolv> you're making incomplete associations, mrig. Please elaborate who these are connected with the Buddha
[16:28:10] <amigojapan> assan:  I also very often dream about them

[16:30:05] <amigojapan> assan: I am not sure about the word God, I think it is teh same as the word DIos inSpaanish kami in Japanese and Allah in islam
[16:30:13] <evolv> mrig, and his name is Buddha
[16:30:19] <evolv> not bu dha
[16:30:53] <Blankspace> Buddha is derived from buddhi word which means intellect
[16:31:11] <mrig> evolv: the greeks gave the human form, so far as I am aware.
[16:31:16] <Blankspace> One who is enlightened in knowledge is hence known as buddha
[16:31:27] <mrig> jaggannath is also the samt.
[16:31:29] <mrig> same
[16:31:29] <evolv> mrig, the greeks did no such thing

[16:33:14] <evolv> mrig, current theory suggests icons of Buddha, art like statues, may have arose because of Greek influence. Not the actual person
[16:33:30] <evolv> the aniconic theory

[16:33:38] <evolv> is that what you've been talking about?

[16:34:23] <evolv> which is false
[16:34:34] <assan> amigojapan and the english are who?
[16:34:57] <amigojapan> assan: peole who lived in england?
[16:35:00] <Blankspace> Why it is not known by Greek name then
[16:35:08] <Blankspace> Why it is known by Hindi name
[16:35:23] <evolv> Hindi?
[16:35:34] <amigojapan> Blankspace: in Spanish it is known as Dios, completly differnet word, same meaning
[16:35:36] <mrig> evolv: buddha is a sanskrit word, as is tathagata
[16:35:37] <Blankspace> Buddha is Hindi word
[16:35:50] <evolv> Blankspace, Pali and Sanskrit predate Hindi
[16:35:52] <mrig> though tathagata is more of a phrase

[16:38:46] <mrig> was panini the buddha?
[16:39:04] <amigojapan> assan: use that word if that makes you happy

[17:30:47] <assan> that's like earth too
[17:31:21] <amigojapan> Alright

[18:00:35] <mrig> Cult as a negative term is a reflection of a dogmatic culture, that ones people be readily indoctrinated into sill or dangerous beliefs is symptom of a poor spiritual education; Worst of which is the use of fear.

[18:19:33] <mrig> Delf: memorising things or actually understanding them, there is quite a difference?
[18:20:24] <Delf> Not asking for elephant or monkey memory... But a little bit of memory is necessary to work with things in order to understand them, right?
[18:20:27] <mrig> Some of the most stupid people that i've known have been fantastic memorisers of facts, but man they understand nothing.
[18:20:46] <mrig> Id go so far as to say that they can be quite dangerous.
[18:20:53] <Delf> I've heard that before...
[18:21:04] <mrig> sure yes a little memory goes a very long way.
[18:22:48] <Delf> I do prioritize understanding above remembering but understanding does require some working memory. This is why I'm such a simple person, because my memory sucks shit and I have to have simple codes and values to work with. Otherwise I cannot function at all
[18:23:16] <mrig> My personal take on the intellect is that there are different phenotypes that work together to make the whole; As such any evaluation of an individual is somewhat mute and pointless.
[18:23:31] <mrig> really does miss the point entirely.
[18:23:53] <mrig> but some are very slow in coming to spot this facet of human nature.

[18:28:08] <Delf> Humble brag much!? :D
[18:29:52] <Delf> mrig: At the core it is our capacity to orientate our internal and external environment that makes us different from one another
[18:30:37] <mrig> my memory has a really powerful filter placed upon it, which often gives the impression that I am a slow learner.
[18:30:56] <mrig> not something that I really get much say in either.
[18:31:50] <mrig> Delf: I put that down to trajectory through spacetime, and think that you are quite right there.
[18:32:51] <mrig> Then orientation is all about vectors and navigation, be the mental or physical.
[18:35:11] <Delf> I don't need to defend what I think I am when I have a whole horde doing that for me. It's got pros to offloading such tasks to external environment
[18:36:13] <mrig> I don't need to defend anything at all, there is no combat.
[18:36:20] <Delf> But in any such condition, I will most likely go to the offense of trying to dismantle other's illusion about what they are, considering them to be delusional

[18:37:24] <mrig> I have no idea what that means to be honest.
[18:38:04] <Delf> I will translate. You're doing the navigating of your internal environment rather than letting others do it for you
[18:38:04] <mrig> I don't think that I am, no.
