[07:01:55] <sm> how complicated can I make game state persistence, that can handle old file formats ?
[07:02:24] <sm> very 
[07:02:55] <sm> just hit my first "resource busy (file is locked)" error
[07:05:22] <sm> readFileStrictly saves the day. Maybe that's the last piece

[07:43:15] <sm> f-a: cr has a new scores file format, and should read and auto-migrate your old one (you might want to keep a copy just in case: cp ~/.local/share/caverunner/scores{,1}
[07:46:24] <sm> I'm trying to generalise all this loading and saving stuff, but haven't quite managed it: https://github.com/simonmichael/games/blob/b269db19c089a0a5cf73dee9d7a10b85f7eb08ec/caverunner/caverunner.hs#L289:L295
[07:47:26] <sm> I have been hacking haskell for many years now but I still quickly get lost when I start messing with typeclasses or even just polymorphic types, GHC's type definition language is a huge maze
[07:49:08] <sm> will get it next time maybe
