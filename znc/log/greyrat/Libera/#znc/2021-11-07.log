[01:45:36] <samuelb> MetaNova: thank you very much for the summary about best practices. I'm going to save it!
[01:46:22] <MetaNova> no problem
[01:47:52] <MetaNova> there are lots of other things you can consider, which in my opinion are entirely optional for regular users, in case any of them appealed to your preferred operations
[01:48:11] <MetaNova> loading the fail2ban module, for example
[01:48:30] <MetaNova> specifying a whitelist of allowed hosts to log in to your user
[01:48:47] <MetaNova> restricting logins to client certificate only
[01:49:00] <MetaNova> (will reject logins via password, even if the password is correct)
[01:49:28] <MetaNova> running ZNC in a jail, a container, and the like
[01:49:53] <MetaNova> also running fail2ban (the system daemon) on top of/in addition to ZNC's fail2ban
[01:51:42] <MetaNova> physically renaming/moving/deleting modules such as shell or log (for example) which might theoretically pose a risk to the system (when in reality, if your ZNC instance is compromised, you should consider your system user login compromised, so preventing an intruder from loading/using *shell is actually relatively moot)
[01:52:27] <MetaNova> going to the length of configuring your system firewall to block all connection attempts to your ZNC listening port, except for (again) a whitelist of hosts/IPs you specify ahead of time
[01:52:56] <MetaNova> (which if used renders the allowed logins list within ZNC redundant)
[01:54:10] <samuelb> ^
[01:54:17] <MetaNova> disabling webadmin/allowing webadmin (or web period) access to a specific bindhost/separate port from the IRC listening port (negligible benefit)
[01:54:40] <MetaNova> and um
[01:55:02] <MetaNova> our friend from earlier is actually the primary author of the Hardening wiki page
[01:55:33] <MetaNova> which goes over even more things to consider
[01:56:06] <MetaNova> here we are: https://wiki.znc.in/HardeningTest and https://wiki.znc.in/Certificatetest
[01:56:46] <samuelb> ^ awesome ^
[01:57:01] <MetaNova> I guess since we're on the topic, I should mention: ALWAYS uses SASL auth where available
[01:57:10] <MetaNova> unless I mentioned that already
[01:57:21] <MetaNova> in which case, it's important enough to warrant a reminder, I guess
[01:57:35] <samuelb> for sure ;)
[01:58:12] <samuelb> saved all your advices in my notes
[01:58:18] <MetaNova> cool
[01:58:49] <MetaNova> I might just use my own logs of this/these summaries and one day make a best practices/things to consider outline
[01:58:55] <MetaNova> but that day is not today
[01:59:14] <samuelb> thank you for your time writing them here
[01:59:19] <MetaNova> no worries
[01:59:45] <samuelb> I'm sure those would be very useful and I will share them if anyone asks for
[01:59:50] <MetaNova> if a question gets asked enough, and I eventually answer it enough, it grows closer to becoming part of the wiki
[02:00:00] <MetaNova> you're actually contributing in a small way
[02:00:18] <MetaNova> (forcing rehearsal, motivation to just make it into part of the wiki)
[02:00:47] <samuelb> :D ;)
[02:00:48] <MetaNova> but I CBA this moment because I'm writing an angry product review
[02:01:02] <samuelb> :D
[02:01:42] <samuelb> good inspiration with that writing ^
[02:02:12] <Khaytsus> uh oh, MetaNova anggy
[02:02:31] <Khaytsus> 1/5 would not inflict such aguish on enemies
[02:04:35] <MetaNova> Khaytsus: bro, I feel dirty
[02:04:52] <MetaNova> not only is this the first time newegg has burned me, but it's worse than anything amazon has ever done
[02:04:57] <Khaytsus> I hope your review isn't for soap
[02:05:16] <Khaytsus> Newegg, or one of newegg's random fill-in etailers
[02:07:00] <MetaNova> thought I was buying an external drive, paid a reasonably-decent price for the advertised capacity (4TB), turns out to be /just/ the enclosure. numerous aspects of the sales page boldly and specifically indicate "4TB" -- back of the box simply reads, "compatible with all 2.5" SATA hard drives & SSDs" so it's not like it was a sloppy mistranslation of "up to 4TB drives supported" or whatnot, "4TB" was pulled out of thin air
[02:07:14] <MetaNova> I feel outright scammed and this is the first 1-star I've ever given anything
[02:08:15] <MetaNova> a case/enclosure by itself, even an aluminum one, is absolutely not worth more than $20, this was three times that
[02:09:28] <MetaNova> refund already approved/return shipping label created, I'm not worried about getting my money back, I'm angry that they would let something so obviously intentionally-misleading get sold through them
[02:12:34] <Khaytsus> MetaNova: Sucks..  Yeah someone in #hardware the other day was about to click the BUy button and everyone kept telling them NO THAT IS NOT POPULATED STOP but he wouldn't listen..  it was really not clear.  Just had capacity list everywhere.
[02:12:48] <Khaytsus> But if you googled for that enclosure, it was more disclosed in other places.
[02:12:56] <Khaytsus> Plus it was way too cheap
[02:13:32] <Khaytsus> I got a USB 3.1 to NVME a while back to attempt to install an os on a locked-out laptop..  failed, it's also secureboot'ed so it won't boot it.  Dang it.
[02:13:41] <Khaytsus> So I should use that I guess, it's just sitting in a drawer now :(
[02:14:12] <MetaNova> I see now looking at the "Similar Products" autopopulated list there is a faint "Sponsored" overlay on its thumbnail
[02:14:26] <MetaNova> this explains a lot
[02:14:43] <Khaytsus> Yeah, I pretty much only buy from Amazon and Amazon Prime handling, because if it's $whatever, it goes back.
[02:14:56] <Khaytsus> Not always the best price though, so there's that.
[02:15:12] <Khaytsus> I was about to get more puppy pads here for our ferrets..  double the price at the local store.  heh.
[02:20:03] <MetaNova> puppy pads aren't cheap
[02:20:18] <MetaNova> especially at the quantity you can go through
[02:20:19] *** Quits: Pippin_ (Pippin_@openvpn/community/Pippin) (Quit: Quiting)
[02:34:16] <MetaNova> Khaytsus: to make matters worse, about a month ago I ordered https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OJ3UJ2S and I've been exceptionally happy with it. for $12
[02:34:36] <MetaNova> ordered [..] because I needed one*
[02:37:24] <MetaNova> (so that even rules out the "screw it, I'll just keep it because I needed one and I'm lazy enough to not care about overspending by $60 on it" aspect, which didn't even apply in my case)
[02:45:35] <Khaytsus> I have one of those types too, the laptop size, I've put sata SSD's in 'em before..  basically because I have no other portable drive and my biggest thumb drive is 64G
[02:46:35] <MetaNova> I recently decided to get a bit closer with the times and bought myself new flash drives for the first time in my life
[02:46:51] <MetaNova> (every other flash drive in my life has been a gift or a hand-me-down)
[02:46:54] <Khaytsus> Yeah mine are all.. 5+ years old
[02:47:09] <MetaNova> 5? I still have a functional 64MB flash drive
[02:47:18] <MetaNova> has lilo on it
[02:47:19] <Khaytsus> My fastest is the shittiest looking of the bunch..  all plastic, won't plug in without holding the usb bit outwards... heh
[02:47:33] <Khaytsus> Yeah I still own my first thumb drive, I said my _newest_ is 5+ years :P
[02:47:54] <Khaytsus> My first was 64M, transparent orange case, about the size of a thumb..  heh
[02:49:04] <Khaytsus> https://www.amazon.com/Lexar-JumpDrive-128GB-Flash-Drive/dp/B00S5V5PJC/  <--  except 64G.  It's pretty dang fast, at least compared to my others...  but it's so junky feeling
[02:49:10] <MetaNova> my largest/fastest now is rated at (up to) 420/380 MB/s read/write, USB "3.2" SanDisk Extreme PRO 256GB, and a SanDisk Ultra Flair USB 3.0 128GB (for the girlfriend)
[02:49:21] <MetaNova> first USB3 flash drives I've ever owned, too
[02:49:38] <Khaytsus> Only thing I use flash drives for anymore is a fresh install of a distro or something which isn't often so what I hvae is fine
[02:49:58] <Khaytsus> i have some stripped out windows 10 install on a thumb drive for those "halp my pc" times
[02:50:33] <MetaNova> I keep several up-to-date bootable flash drives on hand at all times, including my "toolkit" and some install media
[02:50:52] <Khaytsus> Yeah I used to keep a Fedora live up to date on one..  I suspect it's on Fedora 14... :D
[02:51:45] <Khaytsus> It is 16G, 4G is "os", the remaining 11.x is a partition that's untouched when I re-burn the latest on it
[02:52:04] <Khaytsus> and has a few scripts on it that set up the live...  just gotta mount it and run 'em and done
[02:52:16] <MetaNova> WinXP and Win7 PE (Hiren's), Win10 PE (HirenUSB or whatever they're calling themselves now), gparted live/parted magic, and some others
[02:52:44] <Khaytsus> Probably waht I have here..  it's not something I use often, not a windows guy.  
[02:53:36] <MetaNova> since the only real-world linux users I know are also consequently /not/ the type to need to ask me for (software) help, I'm not concerned about supporting them at any given moment
[02:53:58] <MetaNova> so having many Windows-centric/Windows-related options has been a necessity
[02:54:41] <Khaytsus> Yeah, this is for the bi-yearly "we don't know what we did to our pc" from the mother in law and I either nuke it from orbit or throw a fresh install on some drive and install it
[02:55:38] <MetaNova> I am fortunate enough to have a father competent enough to follow instructions if I give any, including specific commands/command syntax, all that fun stuff to try to describe over the phone, or via video chat or whatever people do these days
[02:55:56] <MetaNova> when that isn't enough I begrudgingly load up TeamViewer
[02:56:15] <MetaNova> and then kill the processes with prejudice when I'm done, I don't even close them gracefully
[02:57:52] <MetaNova> speaking of best practices, Khaytsus: if you ever run into Windows misbehaving, you know the shortlist to bring most systems back to life on their own?
[02:58:48] <Khaytsus> 5 or 10 pound sledge first?  I never can remember.
[02:59:09] <Khaytsus> Honestly no, I have zero use for windows.  if someone wants me to fix it, they get a fresh install
[02:59:53] <Khaytsus> I farted around for 3 hours once on a Win 7 machine that malware had replaced (and utterly broken) the login screen...  I think that's when I drew the line.
[03:00:21] <MetaNova> maybe I shouldn't give away my special sauce
[03:00:33] <MetaNova> but as this is a place of learning and troubleshooting, heck with it
[03:00:43] *** ChanServ sets mode: +o MetaNova
[03:00:46] <MetaNova> Windows 10 fixes, open cmd with Administrator and type:
[03:00:46] <MetaNova> 1) chkdsk c: /f /v /x (either reboot after 2-4 complete or immediately, most-safe is immediately, but generally shouldn't matter)
[03:00:46] <MetaNova> 2) sfc /scannow
[03:00:47] <MetaNova> 3) dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth
[03:00:47] <MetaNova> 4) (in PowerShell opened as Administrator) Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppXPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
[03:00:51] *** MetaNova sets mode: -o MetaNova
[03:00:56] <MetaNova> there, you're a Windows wizard now
[03:01:37] <Khaytsus> heh
[03:01:40] <Khaytsus> So, fresh install
[03:01:44] <Khaytsus> that's what I read
[03:02:06] <Khaytsus> Plus it's punishment for the user..  STOP DOWNLOADING MEGAPUPPYMOUSECURSORS
[03:02:32] <MetaNova> wait, you're telling me you didn't protect them from themselves?
[03:02:58] <Khaytsus> If Windows Defender and disabling IE doens't do it, they tried harder than I could bother.
[03:02:59] <MetaNova> well now it's you who're to blame for their computer
[03:03:11] <MetaNova> doncha know
[03:03:59] <MetaNova> because, sadly/amusingly, if you actually don't protect them from themselves, and it becomes your problem to cleanup/fix, is it not at least somewhat your fault?
[03:04:13] <Khaytsus> My father in law kept getting extra fake antivirus until I nuked IE in like 11 different ways, after that he hadn't had any more issues
[03:04:27] <MetaNova> I'd prefer to not intentionally make more work for myself down the line thank yoooououuu

[22:15:40] <fling> Is there a good module for hilights?
[22:15:54] <fling> to put separate hilights to separate queries?
[22:16:12] <MetaNova> there is [[Watch]]
[22:16:12] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/Watch
[22:16:47] <MetaNova> you can put different watched patterns into different resulting windows
[22:17:10] <fling> this is better than anything I can do with irssi right?
[22:17:16] <MetaNova> um
[22:17:50] <MetaNova> technically irssi's highlight/pattern matching system is more sophisticated and more powerful
[22:18:10] <MetaNova> but even for some irssi users, *watch may be more convenient
[22:18:12] <fling> But I can't get it to log at all hmm
[22:18:20] <MetaNova> it really depends on what is easiest for you to accomplish what you're after
[22:18:31] <fling> thanks
[22:18:45] <MetaNova> weechat is even /more/ capable, as I understand it
[22:18:53] <MetaNova> and the learning curve for an existing irssi user should be minimal
[22:19:06] <MetaNova> if you're interested in finding something which truly checks all your boxes, so to speak
[22:19:09] <Khaytsus> I prefer znc-push for certain things, it's quite flexible and doesn't depend on any particular client..  but I don't use it quite the same as I do a highlight.
[22:19:45] <fling> interesting
[22:19:47] <MetaNova> for alerts critical enough to be forwarded to your phone, push is great
[22:20:28] <Khaytsus> Yep that's what I use it for..  things I want to be notified of "any time".  Highlights I consider somethign I want to know about if I'm already active in irc.
[22:26:17] <fling> should I load watch at a certain level to get it to work at each network?
[22:27:57] <MetaNova> I think watch is a network(-only) module
[22:28:25] <MetaNova> yeah, confirmed
[22:28:49] <fling> thanks for the info
[22:28:49] <MetaNova> fling: you'll need to load it separately on each network you wish for it to act on
[22:29:35] <MetaNova> the good thing is, you only need to really configure it once
[22:29:53] <MetaNova> then use the Dump command and copy/paste into the other *watch queries on the other networks
[22:30:27] <MetaNova> (assuming you had desired identical matches, at least)
[23:03:26] <fling> sweet

[23:14:09] <MetaNova> fling: when specifying the destination for the resulting matches?
[23:14:41] <fling> yes
[23:15:07] <MetaNova> *something should work just fine
[23:15:22] <fling> *thanks
[23:16:54] <MetaNova> you don't have to set the destination as *something though
[23:17:37] <MetaNova> I use the (truly inventive) WATCH and WATCH-<reason> for my separated subjects
[23:17:38] <fling> I just don't like having * there
[23:17:56] <MetaNova> you don't have to specify * as part of the destination window
[23:18:00] <fling> because I will be logging it to files and maybe then grep/sed/awk filenames and something will go wrong :D
[23:18:18] <MetaNova> asterisk shouldn't be saved as a literal in the filename
[23:18:31] <MetaNova> it's substituted with _ I think

[23:58:36] <MetaNova> glguy: you can do that from your client, without webadmin, absolutely
[23:58:43] <MetaNova> glguy: /msg *status help
[23:58:49] <MetaNova> you want 'addport'
[23:59:09] <glguy> oh, somehow I'd convinced myself I'd look in the Help output before and missed it
[23:59:50] <MetaNova> (there is no "changeport" or "modifyport" so if you want to eg use the same port but change bindhost/enable or disable SSL, you have to add a new one, connect to it, delete the original, re-add the "original" and connect to it, then delete the "new" one)
