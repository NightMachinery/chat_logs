[05:36:42] <rtpg> let's say you had a file with a bunch of snapshots of memory usages mapped to process ID (so like RSS, process ID, process command string). And you want to graph it out and have like.. a nice graph where you can hover over a line to get more info/slice it up/etc. Right now I tend to use pandas for this kind of stuff, but it's fiddly and the graphs themselves aren't interactive apart from zooming. Is there some other graphing tool
[05:36:42] <rtpg> that's a bit more plug and play for this kind of stuff?
[05:37:07] <rtpg> Basically want to be able to use datadog's interface without having to actually send the data to datadog
[05:38:19] <rtpg> Maybe my answer here is to just pipe to a sqlite file and look at it with metabase...

[17:40:37] <geoffwozniak> meff[m]: I'm leaning toward software not being measurable in any useful way at this point, mainly because the context of the work seems to play such a huge part
[17:41:11] <geoffwozniak> But I do think there can be some decent guidelines. I don't know just what they would be, though
[17:42:20] <geoffwozniak> I used to think, back in my grad school days, we could measure it all. I doubt that now
[17:43:41] <geoffwozniak> I have been thinking for a while now that we really need anthropologists or something to study software development. I bet we'd get more useful information that way
[17:45:19] <geoffwozniak> I look at people studying public repos and all I can think is how much information is not actually in the repo
[17:47:11] <iDrougge> There is information that cannot be the repo because of its nature, information that cannot be the repo because of technical limitations in VCS systems, and information which absolutely can be, yet isn't, in the repo.
[17:47:47] <geoffwozniak> Lots of information could be in the repo, but it isn't because it's a major pain in the ass to put it there
[17:48:05] <geoffwozniak> Like, say, decent commit messages

[18:51:02] <mjgardner> Hi, thanks for posting my story on the site. May I have an invite? https://lobste.rs/s/oa8sgi/four_noisy_horsemen_perl_hate
[18:51:03] <mockturtle> [ The four noisy horsemen of Perl hate ] - lobste.rs
[18:51:05] <geoffwozniak> c355e3b: we do a very loose Kanban system
[18:51:18] <EdwardIII> kanban but with 2 week timeboxes which you roundly ignore
[18:51:35] <iDrougge> Lomanic[m]: Why does it matter to management how the bugs are made?
[18:51:49] <geoffwozniak> We completely ignore the timeboxes and do no sprint-like stuff
[18:52:11] <geoffwozniak> The Kanban board is solely to see what people are working on
[18:52:17] <iDrougge> It's snprintf-stuff nowadays.
[18:53:09] <Lomanic[m]> iDrougge: "it's the industry standard" was an argument
[18:53:22] <iDrougge> That is never an argument, though I've heard it before.
[18:53:31] <EdwardIII> point to industry standard salaries in response
[18:53:36] <iDrougge> Haha.
[18:53:49] <geoffwozniak> Happily, upper management is not interested in our development practices and doesn't care much about them
[18:53:53] <iDrougge> So when "waterfall" was industry standard, SCRUM would have been bad.
[18:53:54] <drobilla> I really get a kick out of the "spring" thing on a sort of meta level
[18:54:13] <drobilla> The "industry standard" is to do everything in a never-ending series of "sprints"
[18:54:15] <mgdm> I worked on a team before where doing estimates was a very big thing, and the PM stuck rigidly to the Scrum book (and did not appreciate that having no way to modify the process wasn't actually agile). The latest iteration of the Scrum book removes estimation, I look forward to seeing some cognitive dissonance from that kind of folks
[18:54:26] <drobilla> Which is more or less by definition unsustaintable, because... that's what a "sprint" is
[18:54:31] <ngoldbaum> mjgardner: just sent an invite to the email on your blog
[18:54:43] <iDrougge> I'm currently sub-contracting to a company where there is also mandated SCRUM, as well as SAFe.

[19:00:32] <mgdm> a couple of extremely core systems at my work are big Perl stacks
[19:00:42] <mgdm> they've outlasted a couple of things that were intended to replace them

[19:01:42] <mgdm> EdwardIII: still does have tons, that's who I'm talking about :D
[19:02:17] <EdwardIII> mgdm: ah ha that's cool :D i think matt s trout did a lot of consultancy for them back in the day right? but then i remember reading blog posts about them looking to migrate to PHP (a move he was very unhappy about)
[19:02:27] <iDrougge> Not the blurb in the lower right corner about "Built-in quality".
[19:02:34] <EdwardIII> i think booking.com still have a lot of perl stuff
[19:03:07] <mgdm> EdwardIII: ah yeah, the PHP thing arrived in about 2010 or so I think? It was a platform called Forge, with the intent being for Java back-end services and PHP FEs. That's all been and gone now though
[19:03:25] <mjgardner> EdwardIII: Web hosting company
[19:03:36] <EdwardIII> mgdm: what does it look like now? when you burn away the straw in the end, only the metal of PHP remains? :D
[19:04:07] <EdwardIII> mjgardner: ah, host europe group/webfusion/123-reg/whatever they're called?
[19:04:24] <EdwardIII> *only the metal of perl, damn
[19:04:25] <mgdm> EdwardIII: there's a small amount of PHP left. Most though by no means all things are on AWS. A lot of it is Lambda. A lot of it is Node.
[19:04:38] <mgdm> but some of the gnarly metadata systems are still Perl

[19:09:26] <ngoldbaum> aiui, lambda is a lot cheaper than other aws options
[19:09:49] <ngoldbaum> because of how they prorate it and only charge for actual usage time
[19:10:00] <c355e3b> I would argue if you really want to go server-less Cloudflare's product is the "best" for it.
[19:10:08] <c355e3b> Also almost everything in AWS is now minute prorated
[19:10:49] <mgdm> EdwardIII: true, though there are a few things that play to its favour - running our own DCs is very expensive in both money and attention - if we can get out of those we can do other things, the content output by the lambdas is extremely cacheable in most cases, and volume discounts are available
[19:11:07] <ignaloidas> besides bandwidth, which feels to be counted by a half-bit because of how much you pay for it

[22:27:47] * manicennui got an M1 MBA at work.
[22:27:53] <manicennui> No more 2017 piece of crap.
[22:27:54] <ario> whoa
[22:28:08] <manicennui> Sorry, M1 MBP
[22:28:27] <pushcx> Church: it's netfilter-persistent, which I added. The ipv6 table had an overbroad route. It kicked in both times the box restarted. This time I re-saved the rules after removing it rather than wait for the box to power off.
[22:28:27] <ario> only 16gb of ram
[22:28:32] <ario> i need more ram
[22:28:46] <manicennui> I don't.
[22:29:02] <Church> pushcx: Huh interesting.
[22:29:08] <ario> i run docker + xcode mostly
[22:29:21] <pushcx> manicennui: Work has a 3-year refresh cycle on laptops. I've been putting up with a failing keyboard while waiting for them to roll out M1s because I don't want to be locked into a non-M1 for 2.5 years.
[22:29:22] <manicennui> I mostly avoid running VMs locally.
[22:29:26] <Church> How was the overbroad route getting resaved?
[22:29:45] <c355e3b> I need a 64gb mac book at this point
[22:29:49] <pushcx> Church: netfilter-persistent saves the firewall rules on shutdown
[22:29:49] <manicennui> pushcx: We have a similar policy. We stopped buying new hardware last year though, and my machine had problems, so I got a 2017 MBP loaner that had all kinds of problems.
[22:30:10] <manicennui> We started buying new hardware again a couple months ago.
[22:30:19] <pushcx> Unshaky takes care of the extra keypresses, adding it was kinda magical, but my shift key is failing and that's just infinitely irritating.
[22:30:38] <manicennui> The 2017 MBP I had repeated the N key all the time.
[22:30:46] <manicennui> And the USB-C ports were touchy.
[22:30:52] <manicennui> And there were video problems.
[22:31:08] <manicennui> And it decided that it didn't like connecting to work wifi, which is why I now have a new laptop.
[22:34:34] <pushcx> My keyboard repeated e, t, r, s, h, and f before I installed Unshaky. It catches ~30 misfires pre day.

[22:36:53] <pushcx> Speaking of hardware gripes with companies that are typically excellent on hardware, it irks me that Nintendo hasn't fixed their joystick problems on any of the Switch revisions.
[22:36:58] <indigo> 15 air??? That's odd
[22:38:18] <kaine2> indigo: how so
[22:38:34] <manicennui> The Switch joysticks are pretty terrible frankly.
[22:38:42] <indigo> Oh, they've never made a 15 inch air before
[22:38:43] <manicennui> I use their pro pad or whatever.
[22:39:06] <indigo> That's why I thought it was odd :)

[22:40:33] <epilys> pushcx, check out ferm for iptables management
[22:40:33] <kaine2> i believe the touch bar is gone
[22:40:41] <ngoldbaum> if they can get chips but if anyone can get chips from taiwan it‚Äôs apple
[22:40:44] <indigo> ngoldbaum: same here. I want to trade in my 16-inch rMBP for a 13-in mba
[22:40:58] <kaine2> well i imagine tim cook is working his supply chain magic
[22:41:10] <indigo> I've decided to go high powered PC desktop + very portable laptop route
[22:41:27] <kaine2> 13 inch mba is still pretty powerful which is cool
[22:41:50] <ngoldbaum> indigo: you think they‚Äôre gonna update the mba again this fall?
[22:42:15] <ngoldbaum> i doubt there‚Äôs gonna be a 32 gb ram mba, for example‚Ä¶
[22:42:29] <indigo> ngoldbaum: Honestly? I don't think so. I think they're going to release the 15-in as kaine2 said with M1, and then the 14-in and 16-in mbp with M1X
[22:42:49] <geoffwozniak> I don't expect to get new hardware at work for some time
[22:42:51] <ngoldbaum> yeah i want to see what the 14 in replacement looks like
[22:43:05] <kaine2> yeah that kinda makes sense to save the new chips for a pro model

[22:44:01] <ngoldbaum> can it not run linux natively yet?
[22:44:09] <kaine2> my work gave me a 2017 13 inch mbp and i almost instantly spilled bang energy *near* it (not on, thank gosh)
