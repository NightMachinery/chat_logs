[00:15:44] <greycat> you found a Debian guide in /etc/systemd?
[00:15:50] <Izem> No
[00:15:59] <Izem> this is the guide https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-reference/ch05.en.html#_the_basic_network_infrastructure
[00:16:13] <Izem> I am on a phone :/
[00:16:23] <greycat> you found the file /etc/systemd/resolved.conf and you thought that it did something?
[00:17:14] <Izem> ansgar: do I still ln the file you mentioned or the one I found?
[00:17:27] <Izem> greycat: yes 
[00:17:56] <greycat> /etc/systemd/resolved.conf is the config file for systemd-resolved.service which is DISABLED by default in Debian.
[00:18:22] <greycat> You could try using it, because apparently Ubuntu does (or so I hear), but it's not commonly used in Debian as far as I know.
[00:18:40] <ansgar> Izem: /etc/systemd/resolved.conf is the configuration for the systemd-resolved daemon; you usually don't have to edit it (maybe DNS=).  /etc/resolv.conf tells programs which nameserver to contact (of which systemd-resolved provides one on localhost).
[00:19:04] *** Quits: xet7 (~xet7@user/xet7) (Quit: Leaving)
[00:19:05] <Izem> Yes I set the dns option 
[00:19:26] <Izem> ok I will symlink yolo 
[00:19:27] <greycat> That only does anything if you enable the systemd-resolved service.
[00:19:39] <Izem> I have 
[00:20:13] <greycat> in that case, you probably want to use 127.0.0.1 as your nameserver, or something
[00:20:21] <ansgar> There is also a libnss-resolve module which makes programs using libc's getaddrinfo talk to systemd-resolved directly, but I haven't used that.
[00:21:04] <Izem> why a loop back address ?
[00:21:04] <ansgar> greycat: That is what "ln -s /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf" does; the stub-resolv.conf contains "nameserver 127.0.0.53" and a few other settings.
[00:21:10] <greycat> Hmm, the man page says it uses 127.0.0.53
[00:21:58] <greycat> So, you could either put "nameserver 127.0.0.53" in the file, or do this symlink thing.
[00:22:13] <Izem> Ok
[00:22:15] <ansgar> The symlink is better as it includes the other settings :)

[02:11:54] <abrotman> Ugh, there are like no new packages coming into bullseye .. :(
[02:12:15] <PMT> ann-a: okay. Booting Linux commonly involves two files - the kernel, which is just the thing you installed from a package, and the initramfs, which is an archive that gets created on your system out of the kernel modules needed, some scripts, and some config state. It seems like the latter got mangled, and that's why you're having trouble booting.

You could follow that, but then instead of running grub-install, you'd want to do probably update-initramfs -c -k [whatever kernel version], then probably use "lsinitramfs /boot/initrd.img-4.19.0-17-amd64" and make sure it contains a bunch of files and doesn't report any errors, then reboot and see if life is better.

[03:17:03] <ann-a> its not just the possible files, maybe the configurating also that is time consuming but 
[03:17:36] <PMT> if you had /home on a separate partition and could just not reformat that, then maybe, albeit requiring uid fixup, but otherwise that would require more involved work than you've shown an appetite for so far.

[03:20:53] <amacater>  ann-a - you may well get the partitioner complaining about a dirty filesystem if you do that. AS PMT says, if you have a separate /home, keep that.
[03:20:53] <greycat> you can use gnome on wayland or gnome on x11 or xfce or anything you want
[03:21:16] <PMT> If you want to not lose your existing system, I recommend going the route I mentioned and asking questions when you encounter things you don't understand how to do. If you don't want to spend the time to do that, then back up part or all of it from a live environment and reinstall over it. If you don't want to spend the time to do that, then be very certain you don't care and wipe it all out and reinstall. If

[03:45:27] <somiaj> ann-a: do you know what 'open source' or 'free software' is? Read the links dpkg gave you, examples are any software that for one reason or another doens't give users certain freedoms to use/modify/read sourcecode etc.
[03:46:24] <ann-a> yes ofc I guess there is just one that says .iso  so I don't choose whatever +nonfree.packages is
[03:47:13] <sney> if you are planning to install over wifi, or if you have amd graphics, you will most likely need the installer that includes nonfree. 
[03:47:18] <somiaj> can you choose which packages are on any iso? Being non-free isn't any different in this regard, but you ahve been told twice what sort of non-free software is included on those images.

[04:03:12] <Swift110-mobile> Now I have the iso for Debian 11 but I do already have Debian 10 installed. I would like to upgrade in place to Debian 11 how do I do that?
[04:03:29] <sney> Swift110-mobile: if you want to upgrade, see this message from the dpkg bot:
[04:03:34] <sney> dpkg: buster->bullseye
[04:03:34] <dpkg> Read (at least) the upgrading chapter of <release notes> https://deb.li/39cyD . TL;DR: In /etc/apt/sources.list change "buster" to "bullseye", fix the line for security updates (see <bullseye-security>), remove stable-specific lines like buster-backports. apt update && apt upgrade && apt full-upgrade. 3rd party repos like <dmo> cause problems with upgrades. If working over ssh, upgrade ssh first, see <bullseye ssh upgrade>.

[06:10:06] <greycat> generally by installing the proprietary nvidia drivers, which is an involved process and involves building them as a kernel module from source, and is probably not a thing with a Live image
[06:10:09] <ectospasm> Or two days before I left.
[06:10:25] <muhblockchain> ectospasm: neat

[06:13:03] <ectospasm> Usually you select that in the boot menu, before it boots the installer.
[06:13:05] <muhblockchain> debian has a trend of trying to do things Ubuntu way
[06:13:18] <sney> debian live isos have the desktop environment listed in the filename, so you must have ignored that part 
[06:13:31] <muhblockchain> livecd should have real man options: nosplash (noquiet) and don't log into X
[06:13:31] <greycat> oh, you want a console session?  then uh... figure out how to pass kernel parameters to your boot, and pass "systemd.unit=multi-user.target" or "3" for short
[06:13:32] <ectospasm> It will use the graphical installer if you don't select something else within the timeout.
[06:13:42] <muhblockchain> greycat: yeah, like a normal linux user
[06:13:55] * greycat doesn't do Live images
[06:14:08] <muhblockchain> ectospasm: not installer
[06:14:10] <ectospasm> Or at least, that was my experience the last time I installed Debian.
[06:14:17] <ectospasm> muhblockchain: Ah, the LiveCD
[06:14:17] <muhblockchain> im in *livecd*\
[06:14:19] <greycat> there is also a "-standard" Live image that doesn't have an X session, if you want to download *another* gigabyte

[06:14:57] <muhblockchain> greycat: hm right. though the -xfce or whatever still should imo have a nice menu boot option to skip X on this boot
[06:15:12] <greycat> I know nothing about the menus on the Live images
[06:15:13] <muhblockchain> and, as we just learn, these options need a 2nd variant with nofb/nomodeset
[06:16:39] <muhblockchain> pure black screen is the default linux experience in 2021 for many people, made worse by quiet
[06:16:56] <muhblockchain> what it is with quiet, do developers believe people are scared of bootup message scrolling?
[06:17:03] <greycat> Yes.
[06:17:43] <sney> rather *unlike* ubuntu, debian live isos are a low priority. sometimes there's some funk with how they're implemented. want a standard debian experience? use an installer. if it's to test before installing, then use that installer to deploy a vm on whatever OS you're already using.
[06:17:52] <muhblockchain> since we aren't ubuntu, maybe aiming for the lowest common denominator is not good, re quiet
[06:18:23] <greycat> if you want to ask intimate questions about the live images, there's a channel for that on the OFTC network
[06:18:40] <muhblockchain> I mean all about quiet, in everything from netinstall to installed debian
[06:19:21] <greycat> in an installed system, you can just fix it yourself
[06:20:05] <sney> 'quiet' only hides the full verbosity kernel spam. a normal system with working video will still get normal boot messages from systemd, unless you installed a desktop and got plymouth anyway

[12:49:47] <PMT> jle: that's a neat trick. if you cp the deb to, say, /run/ and then sha256sum it, does it remain stable?
[12:50:12] <PMT> (that is, if you run it multiple times on the copy in /run/, does it remain stable even as the one in /target/media/cdrom0/... does not?)
[12:50:15] <jle> I just tested sha256 it directly in /target/media/cdrom and the sha256 is correct
[12:50:35] <Khepra> sgon: sata or nvme ssd?

[12:53:37] <sgon> Khepra: thanks a lot. I just installed nvme-cli. I will see which command I should run to check the health. 
[12:54:33] <Khepra> sgon: nvme smart-log for starters

[12:55:42] <PMT> jle: I should remark that I believe the "use host IO cache" setting can cause...oddities, sometimes, if you flipped that, which is one reason it's not a default-on.
[12:56:38] <PMT> Interesting, it's on by default on the IDE drive that the VM defaulted to sticking the disc on. I wonder if those warnings about oddities are specific to the SATA driver...

[13:01:10] <PMT> well, yes, smartctl queries the same info, it just doesn't know anything about any NVMe selftest hooks.

[13:10:06] <PMT> Did XFS not land that yet? I would have thought Stratis would have smashed that in really fast, or maybe they're relying on dm-integrity and tears of the damned.
[13:10:31] <PMT> (their dm-integrity usage last I checked was...unfortunate, IIRC.)
[13:10:43] <Khepra> afaik it hasn't. I could be wrong, I'm not closely following stratis/xfs dev, only when PopularSite brings it to my attention with a paid-for clickbaity link.
[13:12:57] <PMT> (If memory serves, they just use LVM's hooks for turning on dm-integrity, and LVM...based on what they wrote in the docs, applies dm-integrity to the LV on top, so if you actually have a checksum error, even if you're running a software redundant RAID underneath it, it just tells you "well that sucks good luck your data's hosed" and can't do anything about it)
[13:13:31] <sgon> OK, thanks for the info. I think I will stick with ext4 for now because I am more familiar with.
[13:13:41] <PMT> (IIRC "todo actually figure out how to use checksums to cause repair" is in there somewhere)

[13:17:28] <PMT> The software design docs for Stratis say it's intended to be able to recover from mangling noticed because of dm-integrity in redundant configurations. I'm not sure if that's future aspirations, or they're not using LVM's built-in dm-integrity hooks, or something else is going on.
[13:18:21] <Khepra> currently, outside stratis, on debian, dm-integrity under mdadm would produce whole read faults for one (failing) member of the array, so mdadm would copy from the other known good members
[13:19:19] <Khepra> however that whole approach is suffering from the same reasons ZFS and BTRFS decided to go kitchen-sink and integrate the features into one filesystem, instead of relying on layering of kernel modules

[15:46:44] <Khepra> cadmio: add "cadmio" to "sudo" group.  eg.  usermod -a -G sudo cadmio
[15:46:51] <velix> `apt remove -s dbus` didn't do it. It removed dbus, but login still takes...
[15:47:18] <ede> i just simulated a purge of dbus: https://termbin.com/b6zh
[15:47:27] <cadmio> I don't have usermod is there another way?
[15:47:34] <Khepra> velix: yes, -s is a dryrun only
[15:47:38] <PMT> cadmio: you need to be root in order to fix it.
[15:47:50] <velix> Khepra: ah sorry
[15:48:08] <MrFooBar> cadmio: use su to become root, then add your user to sudo group
[15:48:19] <Khepra> use `su -l`
[15:48:20] <n4dir> probabyl "su -" instead
[15:48:38] <PMT> I would suggest restarting systemd-logind first and seeing if that helps before ripping out dbus for fun. One of these probably has fewer side effects.
[15:48:38] <cadmio> yes but it says: usermod: command not found
[15:48:43] <velix> THAT DID IT.
[15:48:47] <velix> Khepra: Thanks!
[15:48:53] <Khepra> np
[15:49:09] <Khepra> cadmio: did you actually use -l (or - )   for su?
[15:49:10] <jelly> I'd probably reboot and see if the OS still works without dbus 
[15:49:38] <Khepra> it works assuming only dbus and libpam-systemd were taken out.   dbus is no longer ar equirement for systemd since... before buster
[15:49:40] <PMT> And have a live image handy in case the answer is "no"
[15:49:58] <MrFooBar> out of curiosity, why -l? didn't su asume root by default?
[15:50:06] <Khepra> !bullseye su
[15:50:06] <dpkg> In buster, su no longer overrides PATH by default, requiring that you use "su -" or "su -l" for login shells (which is not really a new thing at all...). See https://wiki.debian.org/NewInBuster#Changes for details.

[16:32:58] <Khepra> nyuszika7h: if you need py2, use a virtualenv. that said, I don't think pip even works with 2 any more unless you pull out some super turbo ancient version that doesn't support modern pypi metadata

[17:34:29] <jaafarrc> I'm hosting Caddy on my server, but it doesn't connect, it just says "connection timed out" after trying to connect for a few minutes. I have no firewall blocking anything and `80` and `443` are being used by Caddy and are open on my router. What could be the reason it's not connecting?
[17:36:03] <nixoeen> I am trying to share internet through a LXD instance (Bullseye) using MASQUERADE (iptables) and it doesn't work. The same configuration works outside of LXD. Is there any specific changes there between Bullseye and Buster there?
[17:36:06] <Khepra> jaafarrc: how did you isntall it?   check with tcpdump if the connection is actually established;  check caddy's logs to see if there's an error or something
[17:37:08] <jaafarrc> Khepra: I'l check, but I forgot to mention that this problem happens regardless of what kinda server I'm hosting, it started happening ever since we switched to a new router.
[17:37:38] <Khepra> well then tcpdump will confirm there's no connection being established (properly).
[17:38:27] <jaafarrc> Oops, Caddy is using an old domain.

[18:19:08] <Khepra> mhmd: I don't know about specifics of UFW in that regard. but when it comes to packet filtering, specifying "from" merely is a match on packet's src-ip. you also need to permit responses (ACKs for example) and in general there's a pattern where you first permit all tcp established/related flows, and later specifically permit one by one src/dest/port/...

[22:11:33] <jaguart> a question about APT pinning unexpectedly wanting to upgrade perl: I have APT::Default-Release "bullseye" set - when I check with apt-cache policy, the bullseye version has priority 990 as expected, the testing version has priority 500 - but apt-get --simulate upgrade wants to update perl to testing version? Basically I want a bullseye system and then to manually cherrypick specific packages

[22:23:13] <sussudio> !pinning
[22:23:13] <dpkg> Pinning is a method to choose which version of a package to install when multiple versions are available from <sources.list>.  Bugs are explained at https://web.archive.org/web/20121017070250/http://carlo17.home.xs4all.nl/howto/debian.html#errata .  If you use stable, pinning won't help you from messing up the system, ask me about <backports> instead.  https://wiki.debian.org/AptPreferences

[22:24:33] <greycat> I wish people would actually READ the part that says "If you use stable, pinning won't help you from messing up the system".
[22:24:39] <n4dir> would probably be much easier to just use testing. 
[22:25:17] <n4dir> because you run in that risk by mixing stable with testing anyway, so you might just as well do it in a comfortable way. My 2 cents
[22:25:37] <Khepra> well testing has other drawbacks
[22:26:03] <n4dir> and stable has one advantage, and if you give up on that, i see no reason to run stable
[22:26:16] <n4dir> anyway, that were 3 cents. Enough from me
[22:26:26] <xormor> greycat: I was advised by a GNU/Linux sysadmin who used Ubuntu to use apt-get pinning in Ubuntu and/or Debian, and it worked but was nothing special. I think that was in 2007-2011. I would rather use backports than pinning. I do not like to mess up my system with pinning and such.
[22:26:41] <jaguart> the package I want to install is in all versions up to buster, NOT bullseye and then in SID. It is python, with just basic python dependencies.
[22:26:47] <Khepra> that's rather absolutistic thinking. stable is stable and it's not uncommon to go a bit to !sns land with some things  ..  the stability of all else just makes it easier
[22:27:17] <Khepra> jaguart: at this point ..... virtualenv and pip it :)
[22:27:25] <jaguart> The fix is a trivial change to the name of the python library - was cgi, now urllib.parse
[22:28:05] <jhutchins> jaguart: Wow, I've got two versions of python installed on my systems by default.

[22:28:25] <jaguart> TBH the issue is that the APT pinning doesnt seem to work as documented - apt-cache policy shows that the right versions have the highed priority - but simulate says apt will install a new version with a lower priority

[22:36:38] <jaguart> if APT pinning worked as documented the issue would be already resolved. The other option will just be to manually download the .deb from testing and install it
[22:36:55] <Khepra> ,checkbackport graphite-web --fromrelease sid --torelease bullseye
[22:36:56] <judd> Backporting package graphite-web in sid→bullseye/amd64: all build-dependencies satisfied using bullseye.
[22:37:42] <jhutchins> jaguart: Just think of all those thousands of people who used apt pinning and didn't know it was wrong.
[22:39:14] <Khepra> jaguart: even if you make this work now -- and I'm not that experienced with pinning to offer an advice -- consider that as time passes the package will upgrade and might at some point break, demanding upgraded deps, like python for instance.

[23:01:41] <Khepra> I'm sorry what am I missing here. then how do you expect to pin only some packages from sid?
[23:02:01] *** Quits: pikaburk (~pikaburk@187.147.204.77.rev.sfr.net) (Ping timeout: 248 seconds)
[23:03:23] <greycat> "Stable with specific newer packages" is achieved by using backports.  It cannot be achieved by using pinning.  The whole concept of "mostly stable but with testing cherry-picked by pinning" is NOT SUPPORTED.  It is a thing people made up in their heads and thought could be done.
[23:03:24] <Khepra> jaguart: here's what I used to pull in _only_ mesa from experimental ::   https://bpa.st/KTZQ
[23:03:33] <jaguart> the package I want existed in buster and exists in sid - there is no candidate in bullseye - what I'm expecting was this one package to be pulled from sid and everything else to stay at bullseye
[23:04:15] <greycat> testing + unstable is a different story.  that one is kinda supported.  stable + testing is not.  stable + unstable is not.

[23:04:59] <jaguart> greycat - why does apt want to install the testing perl with prioty 500 over the bullseye perl with priority 990

[23:07:56] <jaguart> and of course security then becomes an issue... I'm going to give up on apt pinning, I will roll-back my sources.list.d additions and manually download and install the .deb
