[08:18:40] <a1> !flyfact
[08:18:41] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: Due to their feeding and breeding habits house flies come into contact with a range of harmful bacteria such as Salmonella and E.coli. Because of this, house flies will often aid the spread of these bacteria passing them onto us by contaminating things, such as food and cooking utensils.
[08:18:49] <a1> bitch ass flies
[08:19:01] <a1> !flyfact
[08:19:01] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: How do house flies eat? A house fly will regurgitate digestive juices onto solid foods and these juices break down the food into small pieces, allowing them to use their mouthparts, called proboscis, to drink the meal.

[08:22:59] <a1> !flyfact
[08:22:59] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: The first recorded use of flies in a criminal investigation was in 13th-century China. By studying the fly population and their larval stages at a crime scene, these buzzing creatures help forensic scientists estimate the time of death. The fly species most helpful in forensic investigations include house flies, blow flies, and flesh flies.

[10:14:29] <csws> I do the same thing with VDSL
[10:14:42] <JollyRgrs> ah, so DSL does a true bridge and pfsense does the auth?
[10:14:47] <csws> yeah
[10:14:51] <JollyRgrs> ah
[10:15:04] <JollyRgrs> wish i could do that with my fiber... but ATT likes to auth via certs on the modem

[10:15:21] <JollyRgrs> one day, i need to kick the family out of the house so i can try this workaround
[10:15:21] <csws> here it's just authenticated by port, any device can DHCP unless the MAC is shitlisted
[10:15:44] <csws> and the only stuff that gets blocked is absolute trash tier anyway. no issues with VMware MACs
[10:15:56] <JollyRgrs> basically, you gotta do weird vlan stuff and bridge the modem to the ONT line for auth, but all other traffic goes to your router device https://github.com/jaysoffian/eap_proxy
[10:16:26] <xe0n> yeah i just dumped the modem into bridge mode and made the firewall auth
[10:16:36] <JollyRgrs> needless to say, playing with that can't be done while wife/kids are at home as they need internet more than my company does

[11:12:44] <csws> close enough!
[11:12:47] <SirSceptalot> it is
[11:12:54] <yuken> A lot of US laws around buying stuff don't actually prohibit the possession or use as well, SirSceptalot - and a lot of the times, do not prohibit making the items/substances either.
[11:12:56] <csws> oh yeah
[11:12:58] <yuken> For example, I can't buy tobacco, I can grow tobacco.
[11:13:01] <csws> the weird non french part of belgium right?
[11:13:05] <csws> I remember we were talking about this now
[11:13:07] <yuken> Can't buy handguns, can build handguns. Can't buy alcohol, can make wine.
[11:13:18] <csws> lol
[11:13:24] <csws> some dudes tried to grow tobacco in south australia
[11:13:30] <csws> and the government went full retard on that
[11:13:38] <csws> wonder what purpose that really serves
[11:13:42] <SirSceptalot> csws, yeah, the northern part speaks dutch, the southern part speaks french
[11:13:43] <yuken> Homegrown tobacco is a-okay here so long as you aren't selling.
[11:13:43] <csws> protecting a monopoly?
[11:14:00] <SirSceptalot> and then there's this little corner that speaks german too, but we forget they're there mostly
[11:14:15] <csws> screw them

[11:14:47] <SirSceptalot> (we sneakily put a "property of belgium" label on that part after the last war)
[11:14:50] <csws> especially as you can throw a basic set of english content in there too
[11:15:45] <yuken> SirSceptalot, there are actually some weird things because of that here. Ignore the messy desk but <https://i.imgur.com/qm6Fe9U.jpg> for example - I can legally hold this in my hands, I can legally build it. I can't, technically, get it repaired by a shop.
[11:15:51] <yuken> If I send it into a shop, they can't legally giev it back to me because I'm <21.
[11:16:04] <yuken> Since no one may transfer possession of a handgun to someone under 21 in my state.
[11:16:11] <csws> >LTT video
[11:16:14] <csws> this is the real problem
[11:16:18] <yuken> fukk u csws 
[11:16:20] <yuken> it's background noise.
[11:16:31] <yuken> I need to clean off my desk.
[11:16:49] <csws> oh well
[11:16:57] <csws> maybe when I escape australia finally I can go over there and teach you how to drive
[11:17:08] <yuken> Escape ASAP. I'll marry you for tax benefits if you need.
[11:17:12] <csws> hahaha
[11:17:15] <csws> I can submit the paperwork next week
[11:17:17] <yuken> We'll have to kiss or more in front of the IRS.
[11:17:22] <yuken> and ICE.
[11:17:24] <csws> the earliest opportunity is 2 months before

[11:17:55] <SirSceptalot> yuken, jesus christ man, when you open that in a small window it looks very NSFW at first glance
[11:17:56] <csws> it's going to get too hot soon
[11:18:12] <yuken> csws, so it looks like if you are married to someone in the US, who is to be stationed abroad for 1+ years, you can be naturalized.
[11:18:17] <yuken> So I just need to join the military, get stationed somewhere.

[11:19:15] <SirSceptalot> that's what I saw first
[11:19:18] <yuken> lolwhat
[11:19:28] <csws> lol
[11:19:33] <csws> weird image preview
[11:19:36] <yuken> SirSceptalot, the frame there, the big ol' green part, is what's legally regulated in the US.
[11:19:45] <yuken> Everything else was mailed to my mailbox by USPS, the government.
[11:19:50] <csws> also who the hell uses the default hexchat theme
[11:22:04] <SirSceptalot> yuken, so basically you can buy al the most functional and difficult to replicate parts of a gun, but not the part that's not a stressed member?
[11:22:19] <yuken> Yep, SirSceptalot.
[11:22:56] <yuken> When they started to serialize guns, they wanted one single regulated, serialized part SirSceptalot. They decided on the frame/receiver, since those are the parts that would have the least complaints, because they're basically never needed to be replaced.
[11:23:02] <SirSceptalot> csws, you've got some UWU hexchat theme?
[11:23:08] <yuken> Whereas you may need to replace barrels, firing pins, etc relatively often (compared to the frame/receiver)
[11:23:23] <SirSceptalot> ah, like that
[11:23:36] <SirSceptalot> wait, are you allowed to own a gun without serial number?
[11:23:39] <yuken> And then, modern designs, the serialized part is also a very low stress part...
[11:23:43] <yuken> so 3D printing!
[11:24:01] <yuken> SirSceptalot, yes. They weren't even required to be serialized in the US by manufacturers until 1968 with the GCA.
[11:24:10] <yuken> And you can legally own, build and transfer with no serial number.
[11:25:18] <SirSceptalot> themoreyouknow_rainbow.gif
[11:25:48] <yuken> There are a ton of laws that conflict in spirit with one another, and a lot of differences between states - in general, the laws do nothing to prevent you from getting anything, if you have enough money, SirSceptalot.
[11:26:02] <yuken> Machine guns are still legal, there's just a limited supply of legal ones (pre-1986 grandfathered stuff), so you gotta be rich to afford them.
[11:26:12] <yuken> Or you can just buy an armed tank.
[11:26:15] <SirSceptalot> taht's probably pretty universal, the "get anything if you have money" part
[11:26:24] <yuken> true true.
[11:26:42] <yuken> If you got $40,000 you can buy a Cold War tank and arm it yourself.
[11:29:01] <yuken> csws, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRd6OZxrEsU
[11:29:03] <yuken> this is a pretty based song.
[11:29:55] <SirSceptalot> isn't there a lot of stuff that has to be disabled too? You say "buy a tank", but doesn't the big gun have to be and remain disabled?
[11:29:59] <yuken> SirSceptalot, no.
[11:30:39] <yuken> SirSceptalot, firearms above 12.7mm (50 cal) are destructive deviecs that need a """tax""" to own/possess, a tax stamp.
[11:30:46] <yuken> But you just fill out daddy's paperwork and wait 3-12 months.
[11:31:06] <csws> if you go to vegas you can hire a tank
[11:31:08] <yuken> With exceptions for firearms that have "general sporting purposes" (like a 12 gauge shotgun)
[11:31:27] <csws> this is pretty good yuken but I'd prefer a version with no vocals tbh
[11:32:33] <yuken> SirSceptalot, see - in 1930s, we wanted to ban handguns and machine guns because scary gangsters. We also added short-barreled shotguns and rifles to that list because "what if they just cut down their stuff" - and one dude got silencers on the list too, because "muh poachers" (during the Great Depression). Well, banning them was unconstitutional, so we just taxed them - $200 in 1934, when a day laborer prolly made $1/day at best.
[11:32:47] <yuken> Handguns never got added ultimately, but SBRs, SBSes, machine guns, silencers and "destructive devices" did.
[11:33:11] <SirSceptalot> damn gotowebinar keeps crashing, hope they send a recording afterwards
[11:34:01] <yuken> SirSceptalot, but, we've managed to find loopholes in the law. For example, this is legally a pistol, despite firing a "rifle cartridge". https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gunsamerica.com%2Fuserimages%2F2006%2F949238072%2Fwm_14589773.jpg&f=1&nofb=1
[11:34:02] <SirSceptalot> heh, so it just comes down to money again
[11:34:28] <A-KO> SirSceptalot: often times gun rights activists forget to mention that the reason gun control exists is for racism :)
[11:34:32] <A-KO> <3
[11:34:39] <yuken> A-KO, stfu don't bring politics into it nooooo
[11:34:41] <yuken> NOOOO
[11:34:56] <A-KO> it's true though? like. not politics.
[11:34:58] <A-KO> it's just truth
[11:35:11] <yuken> I know :P
[11:35:16] <A-KO> especially when people whine about California's gun laws :)
[11:35:26] <A-KO> who was the governor when that happened? Ronald Reagan :)
[11:35:29] <SirSceptalot> I could prolly look this up but what defines a "pistol" then?
[11:35:57] <A-KO> And why did California institute major gun laws? Because black people armed themselves.
[11:36:04] <yuken> SirSceptalot, a rifle is a firearm with a shoulder stock, a stock designed to be held against your shoulder. A pistol is any rifled firearm, without a stock, designed to be used with ""one hand"".
[11:36:26] <csws> uh oh
[11:36:27] <yuken> SirSceptalot, that thing on the back, LEGALLY, is not a stock.
[11:36:35] * SirSceptalot looks at picture again
[11:36:40] <SirSceptalot> looks pretty stock-y to me
[11:36:41] <yuken> It's a "pistol brace" designed for "disabled shooters".
[11:36:53] <yuken> SirSceptalot, which is meant to be used like this, https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.guns.com%2Fwordpress%2F2016%2F11%2FIMG_8684.jpg&f=1&nofb=1
[11:37:03] <yuken> but the ATF don't care how you use it (as of 2016-ish), just what it was designed for. Wink wink.
[11:38:14] <yuken> SirSceptalot, legally speaking, this thing also isn't a shotgun <https://i.imgur.com/iLeNOwN.jpg> - because a shotgun must have a stock (or originally designed as a shotgun, with the stock removed).
[11:38:27] <yuken> Legally its category is "Firearm"/"Any Other Weapon"
[11:38:46] <SirSceptalot> well that's not so much a loophole is it? More of a loop-redcarpetedwalkway
[11:38:54] <yuken> lol
[11:39:39] <yuken> SirSceptalot, overall it's a huge mess, but at least I don't need any licenses or permits or training.
[11:40:50] <SirSceptalot> As a mechanical device and a thing for sport, I really do appreciate weapons of any kind
[11:41:47] <SirSceptalot> but it is scary that they're so legal and so easily obtainable, know how many rotten people exist that shouldn't even be called people

[11:43:28] <csws> SirSceptalot, do you guys have ranges where you can shoot without a license?
[11:44:09] *** Joins: lancehead (~lancehead@user/lancehead)
[11:44:17] <lancehead> morning
[11:45:08] <SirSceptalot> I THINK so. To OWN a gun you need a license and you must be a member of an officially registered "sport shooting club" or whatever it translates to
[11:45:16] <SirSceptalot> morning lancehead 
[11:45:21] <yuken> When you say "own"...
[11:45:23] <lancehead> Oh, we talkin gun laws in NL and BE? 
[11:45:24] <yuken> can you keep ammo at home?
[11:45:30] <lancehead> Yes yuken 
[11:45:43] <lancehead> At least in the Netherlands that's the case 
[11:45:44] <yuken> I just mail-ordered a bunch of ammo and that's no big deal over here.
[11:45:48] <yuken> Lots.
[11:46:04] <SirSceptalot> but I think that if you just want to shoot once you can make an appointment at one of those clubs (or walk up idk) and have a go at it, supervised
[11:46:11] <lancehead> Might depend on the type of license you get though. There's hunting ones and sporting ones 
[11:46:24] <Banditoz> is ammo still pretty expensive?
[11:46:24] <yuken> well not lots, just a few hundred rounds.
[11:46:29] <yuken> which is pretty small.
[11:47:11] <SirSceptalot> yuken, I think you can have them at home, but I dunno the specifics
[11:47:25] <yuken> SirSceptalot, I assume you have stuff like random police checkups, safe requirements, etc.
[11:47:35] <yuken> Whereas I literally have an AR-15 behind me, loaded, behind my bed.
[11:47:38] <yuken> and it stays there when I sleep.
[11:48:45] <SirSceptalot> I do know that in order to transport a weapon it needs to be physically seperated from ammunition, and afaik both must be packaged in a way that makes it impossible to use quickly
[11:48:59] <yuken> That is a requirement in my state unless you have a conceal carry permit.
[11:49:13] <SirSceptalot> so ammo in the front, taped in a box and gun in the trunk or something
[11:49:19] <lancehead> Yeah, if you want to transport firearms you need a hardcase for handguns and a proper case built into the trunk of your car for rifles 
[11:49:31] <lancehead> And they're required to be in the trunk 
[11:49:41] <yuken> There's no such requirement for that other than "not immediately accessible". So if you have to climb over your driver's seat, that's prolly good enough here.
[11:49:57] <SirSceptalot> prolly the same here then, laws like that are usually pretty similar between BE/NL

[11:50:33] <yuken> Well, for now.
[11:51:01] <lancehead> I've been tempted to get a license and a handgun. I'm obsessed with firearms, they're a hobby of mine 
[11:51:11] <lancehead> You can only shoot .22lr for the first few years but I wouldn't mind plinking a little 
[11:51:17] <yuken> lancehead, just get them illegally, super easy in NL!
[11:51:19] <yuken> (don't actually do that)
[11:51:25] <yuken> ((if you do do it don't talk about it))
[11:51:27] <yuken> (((but don't)))
[11:51:39] <lancehead> After that you can move up to 9mm and 45acp, then after a few years you can get small rifle calibers like 5.56 and 5.45 
[11:51:45] <yuken> oof.
[11:52:00] <lancehead> 7.62x39 and .308 are off limits though I think 
[11:52:09] <yuken> Why would 7.62x39 be off limits? wot
[11:52:14] <lancehead> Seen as military-grade ammunition 
[11:52:15] <yuken> Old laws about military cartridges?
[11:52:17] <yuken> lmao
[11:52:19] <lancehead> Yep 
[11:52:32] <yuken> but... 5.56x45...
[11:52:35] <yuken> that's your country's standard.
[11:52:47] <lancehead> Yeah idk, laws are weird  
[11:52:56] <lancehead> Actually 7.62x39 might be allowed 
[11:55:21] <yuken> lancehead, here in the US, I've never even undergone a background check for my stuff.
[11:55:26] <yuken> And it's all been mailed to my front doorstep.
[11:55:57] <lancehead> 7.62x39mm is allowed apparently 
[11:56:50] <lancehead> lol so I have 3 PCs set up right now. I have my own, a desktop and a laptop 
[11:57:01] <lancehead> The extra 2 are for someone to TV into later today and do some stuff remotely

[12:04:59] <SirSceptalot> yuken, just read that article. Eh, can't say I fully agree, even if I get some points
[12:05:38] <SirSceptalot> both parties having a gun doesn't constitute a level playing field, a 19yr old gangbanger will still have the edge over the fat little old lady
[12:05:38] <yuken> SirSceptalot, well it's a good thing that whether you agree or not, and whether it's legal or not, anyone with a garage and some hand tools and a 3D printer can make them easily.
[12:07:27] <SirSceptalot> that's still only part of the population though
[12:07:38] <yuken> I'll sell them to the gangbangers for money.
[12:07:46] <yuken> Only requires part of the population to know how to do it, and want to.
[12:10:13] <SirSceptalot> wait you'll sell to the gangbangers? :p what did fat little old ladies do to you?
[12:10:31] <yuken> nothing SirSceptalot, but _SOMEBODY_ will fill the market... so I might as well and make bank.
[12:10:39] <csws> I mean I'd sell gangbangers something that'd more likely blow up in their face than kill little old ladies tbh
[12:10:49] <yuken> nah csws you need return customers, and to prove how futile it is.
[12:10:54] <lancehead> Man I'm so confused 
[12:10:56] <yuken> So the little old lady can conceal carry an RPG.
[12:11:03] <lancehead> Teamviewer VPN is confusing

[12:11:19] <yuken> csws, you have to build them reliable enough to use, but not so reliable they last generations.
[12:11:25] <yuken> So that they have to keep coming back.
[12:11:32] <lancehead> Yes, csws
[12:11:33] <SirSceptalot> can... can you legally carry an rpg with a permit?
[12:11:39] <csws> or I just preserve my soul and stay away
[12:11:46] <lancehead> Not with high explosive rounds, SirSceptalot 
[12:11:54] <lancehead> HE rounds are always illegal obviously 
[12:11:55] <yuken> SirSceptalot, generally, transportation of explosives require permits and notification of authorities and etc.
[12:11:56] <csws> rocket propelled potato cannon maybe?
[12:11:58] <yuken> lancehead, not in the US.
[12:12:00] <SirSceptalot> LOL
[12:12:03] <SirSceptalot> OBVIOUSLY :p
[12:12:05] <yuken> SirSceptalot, but you could have non-explosive rounds.
[12:12:31] <SirSceptalot> granny's packing heat
[12:12:37] <lancehead> yuken, civilians can't own HE rounds unless you're a registered manufacturer of them I'm pretty sure 
[12:12:42] <yuken> lancehead, this is in the US.
[12:12:44] <lancehead> You can also buy grenade launchers SirSceptalot 
[12:12:46] <lancehead> Yeah I know
[12:12:51] <yuken> Oh, well you can own those just fine.
[12:12:52] <lancehead> Even in the US you can't just go buy HE rounds
[12:12:54] <yuken> Yes you can.
[12:12:56] <yuken> If you find a seller.
[12:13:04] <lancehead> An illegal one, yes 
[12:13:12] <yuken> A legal one.
[12:13:13] <lancehead> You can't legally buy HE rounds lmao 
[12:13:29] <yuken> ... sure you can.

[12:14:33] <lancehead> That's the devices, yes, not HE rounds 
[12:14:36] <yuken> no.
[12:14:36] <yuken> the rounds.
[12:14:42] <SirSceptalot> colour, we're not talking about windows right now, catch up
[12:14:47] <lancehead> Find me the exact law that states a civilian can legally buy HE rounds 
[12:14:49] <yuken> You can go buy a grenade if you find a seller, lancehead. There is nothing illegal about that.
[12:14:53] <yuken> lancehead, no, it's the opposite in US law.
[12:14:56] <csws> yeah @Colour if you're not constantly chasing the almighty dollar it does seem like a terrible thing to do
[12:14:56] <yuken> There is no law that prohibits it, therefoer it's legal.
[12:15:03] <lancehead> A grenade, yes; not a 42mm round 
[12:15:08] <yuken> They are considered a Destructive Device and require a background check and a $200 tax stamp.
[12:15:16] <yuken> Yes, a 40mm/37mm round.
[12:15:22] <SirSceptalot> lancehead, anything is legal unless forbidden by law
[12:15:26] <csws> man lucky that tax stamp never grew with inflation eh
[12:15:31] <yuken> oh ye absolutely csws.
[12:15:35] <yuken> They tried.
[12:15:48] <csws> give it another year or two and you'll be paying that much per gallon for petrol
[12:16:02] <yuken> lancehead, there is no prohibition of civilian ownership of explosives rounds, including 37mm/40mm launcher rounds. The hard part is finding them for sale.
[12:16:13] <yuken> But there's nothing prohibiting civilian possession, purchasing, or transfering. And you can build them, too, with a Form 1 iirc.
[12:16:25] <SirSceptalot> yuken, I'm going to go over the top now, out of curiosity
[12:16:37] <SirSceptalot> how 'bout REALLY high explosive stuff
[12:16:49] <SirSceptalot> as in, a fucking missile or something
[12:17:06] <SirSceptalot> or a big ... dunno what it's called, a bomb for a bomber
[12:17:15] <SirSceptalot> I guess that's just a bomb...
[12:17:33] <yuken> SirSceptalot, I believe ground missiles are legal, but you can't legally own missiles that can target aircraft, and at a certain point you go from...
[12:17:40] <yuken> gun law into aircraft law and FAA/aviation shit.
[12:18:05] <yuken> Anti-tank missiles are perfectly legal to own and buy and transfer though, SirSceptalot.
[12:18:32] <SirSceptalot> in case you need to defend yourself from that dick that rented a tank in vegas
[12:18:39] <yuken> You can't own nuclear weapons, biological/chemical weapons, missile systems designed to destroy aircraft, and such.
[12:18:59] <yuken> You can just buy an RPG in case of shooting down helicopters, that's legal, since it's not a missile system.
[12:19:24] <SirSceptalot> hm
[12:19:32] <yuken> lancehead, you can also just straight up own artillery in the US - howitzers, anti-aircraft guns, whatnot. And get explosive rounds for those.
[12:19:39] <yuken> You can go out and buy a mortar and HE rounds for them right now.
[12:19:41] <SirSceptalot> what's the difference between a rocket propelled grenade and a rocket propelle missile?
[12:19:57] <yuken> SirSceptalot, missiles have guidance systems.
[12:19:58] <SirSceptalot> isn't a missile just a bomb with propulsion?
[12:20:02] <SirSceptalot> oh
[12:20:16] <yuken> Grenades are guided only by you, and have no way to remotely control them after the fact.
[12:20:19] <lancehead> Alright, you can buy HE rounds; but you pay an additional $200 tax stamp PER ROUND and they're a few hundred dollars each 
[12:20:24] <yuken> Yes.
[12:20:27] <yuken> No permits required.
[12:20:30] <yuken> You just have to be rich :)
[12:20:32] <lancehead> So if you want to buy HE rounds, be prepared to pay $600 per round
[12:20:41] * csws grinds teeth
[12:20:46] <csws> I hate teams
[12:20:52] <lancehead> And then there's also the fact that the cheapest 40mm launcher out there is >9K 
[12:20:59] <yuken> wat
[12:21:04] <yuken> you can 3D print one at home nowadays lol
[12:21:08] <yuken> They're SUPER low pressure.
[12:21:12] <lancehead> Cheapest buyable one 
[12:21:16] <lancehead> Off the shelf 
[12:21:28] <yuken> They're nothing but a tube. Basically a shotgun except even lower pressure.
[12:21:33] <SirSceptalot> does the same tax thing apply to explosive rifle rounds?
[12:21:42] <lancehead> Yeah, I know ballistics 
[12:22:04] <lancehead> Not sure SirSceptalot
[12:22:10] <yuken> lancehead, https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FAu6wrIWEAIYWs4?format=jpg&name=4096x4096
[12:22:19] <yuken> two 3D printed with steel pipe designs for 40mm launchers.
[12:22:23] <yuken> One is magazine fed.
[12:22:26] <lancehead> Brother 
[12:22:30] <lancehead> I never said you can't 3D print them 
[12:22:32] <yuken> It's pog.
[12:22:35] <yuken> I never said you said that lol.
[12:22:38] <lancehead> Cheapest one you can *buy* is that expensive 
[12:22:45] <yuken> I'm going to make one and buy some HE rounds for it one day.
[12:22:49] <lancehead> Well I never said you said that I said what you said when we said the things we said either! 
[12:22:49] <yuken> Just in case I get raided by the IRS.
[12:22:58] <yuken> (that is a joke)
[12:23:35] <yuken> lancehead, the tax stamp is kinda akin to a permit, but requires no... special processes, training, etc - you basically just pay the $200 and wait 3-12 months for the ATF to tell you to fuck off, here's your stamp.
[12:24:29] <lancehead> And then you have to find someone who will sell you new HE rounds 
[12:24:35] <yuken> r just build them.
[12:24:37] <lancehead> Which is maybe 7 people in the US 
[12:24:51] <lancehead> oh yeah that's a great way to die real painful
[12:24:53] <yuken> Nothing prohibits you from building them :P
[12:25:09] <SirSceptalot> reminds me of that song
[12:25:16] <SirSceptalot> g! dumb ways to die song

[12:25:32] <lancehead> I'd absolutely love having a 3D printed tube blow up on me and send shrapnel into my neck killing me slowly
[12:25:41] <lancehead> PLEASE do not 3D print a GL and make your own ammo yuken 
[12:25:57] <yuken> I'm gonig to.
[12:26:12] <lancehead> Your parents are going to find you missing an arm with a perforated neck and torso
[12:26:16] <SirSceptalot> lancehead, I'm pretty sure he' make the barrel from something more sturdy than plastic
[12:26:25] <lancehead> Still 
[12:26:26] <yuken> It's just a tube lol.
[12:26:42] <lancehead> Even if it's metal, if your *homemade* round goes off in the tube, you're fucking dead 
[12:27:01] <lancehead> Literally holding a pipe bomb 
[12:27:14] <lancehead> With a little more explosive power than a regular pipe bomb 
[12:27:29] <yuken> sounds awesome.
[12:28:13] <lancehead> Where were you from again? So I can check the obituaries 
[12:28:36] <SirSceptalot> lancehead, 'murica you idiot

[12:32:20] <lancehead> @Colour I chase the bread and can confirm that's pretty stressful 
[12:32:41] <csws> well you don't make shit when you're an intern so
[12:32:53] <SirSceptalot> Simple things, like a taxi... I asked the first taxi driver about his car, because it rumbled nice. "What engine does it have"? - "I dunno... 4 liter V8?"
[12:32:57] <SirSceptalot> LOL
[12:33:00] <csws> I earn decent money now but honestly cbf
[12:33:05] <csws> maybe if I had a mortgage I'd care
[12:33:16] <SirSceptalot> our high performance cars have that. Regular cars are 1.5L or something
[12:33:22] <lancehead> I still have bills to pay csws and like to do things besides eat and paying bills 
[12:33:23] <SirSceptalot> kinda powerfull cars 2L
[12:33:32] <lancehead> When I lose that ability, it stresses me out 
[12:33:38] <csws> wow my car is "kinda powerful" by belgian standards.. that's sad
[12:33:41] <csws> I put the foot down and just feel disappointment
[12:33:48] <yuken> SirSceptalot, my town-city basically doesn't have sidewlaks.
[12:34:00] <yuken> You're walking along the street, except it's not a backwoods village where that's normal.
[12:34:17] <SirSceptalot> csws, My previous car was a 2.2L turbodiesel, "chiptuned" to 180-ish hp
[12:34:24] <SirSceptalot> few cars beat me off the line
[12:34:42] <SirSceptalot> I mean, obviously anything porsche or whatever could, easily

[12:35:33] <SirSceptalot> then again, that 4 liter taxi was probably not or not much faster than my car too I guess, just used more fuel :p
[12:35:44] <csws> at least it sounds cool
[12:35:49] <SirSceptalot> jarp
[12:35:57] <csws> my mum's car is a 3L V6 and it sounds cool
[12:36:41] <SirSceptalot> the only people here with anything above an inline 4 are either wealthy or passionate about cars
[12:37:03] <SirSceptalot> it's too expensive
[12:37:45] <csws> she got a pretty sweet deal as the guy thought it was a ticking timebomb
[12:37:53] <SirSceptalot> Any kind of big V8 is easily €5000/yr road tax, plus equally as much as tax when you first get it
[12:38:14] <csws> turned out the issue was a lack of oil and these things that guide the timing chain were missing
[12:38:21] <csws> so the chain was rattling and he thought it was going to blow up
[12:38:42] <csws> is road tax ontop of registration?
[12:39:34] <SirSceptalot> registration, that was the word I was looking for
[12:40:06] <SirSceptalot> so yeah, if you buy it, €5000 registration and €5000 road tax. After that, €5000 road tax per year
[12:41:12] <sd> 13<C​olour> Lancehead I think that's quite normal sadly. I suppose I think more about people who are chasing hard and going for 6 figure stress jobs at high workload places above all because money comes above comfort

[17:53:11] <vinrock> you ever fry a turkey before?
[17:53:16] <PublicWiFi> nop

[17:53:22] <vinrock> it's super easy and it comes out like nothin you ever had before
[17:53:24] <vinrock> you should try it
[17:53:33] <vinrock> its like a gigantic fried chicken
[17:53:35] <vinrock> it rules so hard
[17:53:37] <PublicWiFi> LOL
[17:53:41] <TurkeyGibby> for the first turkey might want to go traditional

[17:53:56] <TurkeyGibby> alton brown has a fantastic guide, maccas
[17:53:58] <vinrock> honestly, imo deep fried is easier to get a perfect bird
[17:53:59] <PublicWiFi> fritzwastaken hey you're a live
[17:54:03] <JollyRgrs> also, Arby's has sliced fried turkey during this time... and it's pretty good sammich

[17:55:26] <fritzwastaken> I just get turkey breasts and sousvide them
[17:55:28] <vinrock> then you just preheat that shit and toss it in for X amount of time for the weight of the bird
[17:55:32] <fritzwastaken> then throw them on the grill to sear

[18:08:43] <sintax> fritzwastaken: i can believe it. I got laid off once. I was good for about a week and a half and then i started to go nuts
[18:10:53] <fritzwastaken> Doesnt help that ive been coming down off my antidepressants too
[18:11:08] <sintax> yeah that would make it a bit difficult i'm sure.
[18:11:12] <fritzwastaken> ive been going a little nuts
[18:11:22] <fritzwastaken> oh yea, and the unemployment office still hasnt paid me shit
[18:11:28] <fritzwastaken> they owe me about 8k at this point
[18:11:32] <sintax> good luck
[18:11:37] <fritzwastaken> still fighting the fight
[18:11:38] <sintax> they're so far behind and lost in the sauce.
[18:11:54] <fritzwastaken> had to borrow from my parents to pay rent
[18:11:58] <sintax> dang.
[18:12:01] <sintax> that's annoying.
[18:12:12] <fritzwastaken> and calling them is useless, because im waiting for an adjudicator
[18:12:46] <sintax> yeah plus talking to anyone with half a brain is hard to find
[18:14:58] <fritzwastaken> im gunna be caught up, getting paid from my new job, paid my parents back, and then all of a sudden get a call from them
[18:15:46] <sintax> yup and get $8k 
[18:15:50] <sintax> you double dipper

[18:16:11] <fritzwastaken> the last 3 months have sucked
[18:16:15] <fritzwastaken> they should owe me interest
[18:16:22] <sintax> for sure.
[18:16:40] <fritzwastaken> ive done my part, filed my claims, did my job hunting, now you all do your fucking jobs
[18:16:41] <sintax> if anything be nice to just see in your bank account as an oh shit fund

[18:19:06] <sintax> yeah...
[18:19:16] <sintax> i'd so much rather have a rmm than this. 
[18:19:27] <sintax> it's easier. hell i'd take intune and sccm
[18:19:31] <PublicWiFi> PDQ
[18:19:42] <sintax> something besides this dumb thing
[18:19:45] <PublicWiFi> lol
[18:19:55] <TurkeyGibby> yikes
[18:20:19] <PublicWiFi> i had KACE at an old job, everything that was already in tehre worked fine but if I tried to change anything or add anything it was just shit itself
[18:20:29] <sintax> tell me about it
[18:20:37] <sintax> so much to click and do just to get it to install something.
[18:20:42] <PublicWiFi> ^
[18:20:45] <sintax> i'd get rid of this and citrix
[18:20:53] <PublicWiFi> man citrix
[18:20:57] <sintax> move to a RDP Gateway for everyone to work in and probably save money
[18:21:06] <PublicWiFi> citrix isn't bad by itself... most places don't know how to admin it right
[18:21:16] <PublicWiFi> you host citrix there?
[18:21:17] <sintax> I mean it servces a purpose i guess
[18:21:19] <sintax> we do
[18:21:22] <PublicWiFi> ahh damn
[18:21:26] <PublicWiFi> you gotta fuck with it sometimes?
[18:21:31] <PublicWiFi> config n shit,
[18:21:32] <sintax> i don't touch it.

[18:21:38] <PublicWiFi> xD
[18:21:38] <sintax> i let the other sys admin do it.
[18:21:39] <TurkeyGibby> citrix is only good when you've got a person dedicated to doing it
[18:21:40] <sintax> i want no part
[18:21:46] <TurkeyGibby> and I mean DEDICATED
[18:21:48] <sintax> i'd rather fuck with sql db's 
[18:21:54] <TurkeyGibby> oh hai mistiry
[18:21:55] <PublicWiFi> mistiry: interesting..
[18:21:55] <fritzwastaken> mmmm hashbrowns and eggies
[18:21:59] <mistiry> oh hai
[18:22:01] <Activ8> WTF is them images
[18:22:02] <fritzwastaken> breakfast of champions
[18:22:04] <PublicWiFi> I bet Rossmann will be weird about this lol
[18:22:04] <TurkeyGibby> mornin' sugar
[18:22:09] <Activ8> looks like they got a MASSIVE leg
[18:22:30] <PublicWiFi> LOL
[18:22:35] <PublicWiFi> this is peak human
[18:22:39] <sintax> lol
[18:22:42] <Hunterkll> meh it's been a long time in coming 
[18:22:52] <Hunterkll> with Ive out of the way anyway, apple's historically always had programs like this
[18:23:05] <Hunterkll> hopefully they bring back the flat rate repairs too
[18:23:14] <Activ8> gimps
[18:24:03] <Hunterkll> i spilled a 2liter of coke in my ibook once and it was $300, they replaced the hinges, case parts, logic board, battery, screen, like practi8cally just half the casing, drive, and frame were all that was left lol
[18:24:11] <vinrock> rossmann did a video about the apple repair stuff yesterday
[18:24:14] <vinrock> i didnt watch it yet tho
[18:25:34] <Activ8> wait till the first person ends up with 1st degree burns off an exploding battery
[18:25:58] <sintax> i'm sure apple will say you're not qualified and shouldn't have been doing that.
[18:26:06] <Activ8> that's exactly what they will say
[18:26:14] <Activ8> told ya so moment comes to mind
[18:26:20] <Activ8> terms and conditions for sure
[18:26:34] <mistiry> i mean, we _used_ to be able to swap batteries and things just fine, and nobody was burning themselves
[18:26:57] <mistiry> its not like this is a new thing that people will look at like the "files in the computer" scene from Zoolander
[18:26:59] <vinrock> i miss those days
[18:27:10] <vinrock> good ol' replaceable battery era
[18:27:29] <mistiry> and people are capable of replacing batteries in remotes, controllers, etc. too
[18:27:46] <Activ8> well next they need to make a removable battery
[18:27:49] <mistiry> so i dont think we're gonna see this massive uptick in battery injuries
[18:27:52] <Activ8> maybe this is what they are going to do
[18:28:01] <Activ8> make it modular
[18:28:11] <sintax> that'd be sweet
[18:28:26] <vinrock> someone stole rossmanns framework
[18:28:27] <Activ8> then serialize every component so people HAVE to have genuine parts
[18:28:32] <sd> 11<H​otmess> hoenstly i wonder how much framwork laptop had to do with apple self repair
[18:28:43] <mistiry> Activ8: they already do that with some parts
[18:28:48] <Activ8> they do I know
[18:29:09] <Activ8> but in a next update they are going to remove to pairing for the faceID and chip
[18:29:18] <Activ8> so a replacement screen doesn't need reprogramming
[18:29:36] *** Joins: rpifan (~rpifan___@user/rpifan)
[18:29:39] <vinrock> that was some straight bullshit
[18:29:48] <vinrock> claming its for security
[18:29:53] <rpifan> so my current boss has made an airtable list of the current laptop and such asssets
[18:30:00] <vinrock> all you gotta do is pop off the chip and reball it
[18:30:00] <rpifan> does it make sense to move to a more integrated environment
[18:30:13] <rpifan> more professional assest tracking
[18:30:28] <Activ8> one thing I hope they don't to is allow sideloading via app stores
[18:30:35] <vinrock> someone here mentioned snipe-it last week and i decieded to check it out
[18:30:39] <vinrock> im digin it
[18:30:49] <Activ8> if I was a developer I would be more than happy for a 30% cut to apple if I made millions from their app store
[18:31:01] <CptLuxx> lol
[18:31:09] <Activ8> sideloading will open up a SHIT load of bad apps
[18:31:10] <rpifan> yea snipe it is also what ive heard
[18:31:25] <Activ8> exactly like what android
[18:31:30] <vinrock> spin up a vm it took like 5mins to deploy and configure
[18:31:31] <Activ8> exactly like what android has
[18:31:36] <vinrock> its super lightweight
[18:31:53] <Activ8> how light, what vm, what os, what service
[18:32:02] <vinrock> flows nicely too, i didnt read shit and im using it right out the box no issues
[18:32:04] *** Quits: Work-BWMerlin (~Work-BWMe@user/bwmerlin) (Quit: Client closed)
[18:32:28] <rpifan> but snipe it needs some kind of user agent i imagine
[18:32:42] <vinrock> this is just for inventory management
[18:33:03] <vinrock> it isnt gonna track assets by having them phone home
[18:33:08] <rpifan> ahh
[18:33:33] <rpifan> so i have to manually add the info for each item
[18:33:34] <vinrock> but it has a check in/check out way of managing assets
[18:33:39] <vinrock> yeah
[18:33:44] <vinrock> you can import a spreadsheet
[18:34:01] <rpifan> well she made it using airtable 
[18:34:32] <vinrock> it says its made with <3 too in the footer so that's a plus
[18:34:45] <rpifan> yea ive heard good things about snipe it
[18:34:56] <rpifan> i also got a job at a shipping company that was quite large

[19:10:54] <Hunterkll> jumpcloud also has a very, very large skew in terms of how they write their articles because well, they're trying to sell their product :P
[19:10:57] <rpifan> and any time i ask no one knows
[19:11:10] <rpifan> but everyone seems to want to get rid of Azure ASAP
[19:11:22] <Hunterkll> and use what?
[19:11:22] <Hunterkll> lol
[19:11:35] <rpifan> gapps
[19:11:49] <Hunterkll> but that doesn't provide the type of account/machine management you'll need for windows systems

[19:12:09] <rpifan> which is what i ask the dev ppl and i get silence
[19:12:19] <rpifan> since the dev ppl are the only other tech people in the whole company
[19:12:33] <Hunterkll> using gapps federated to azure for login/SSO is a great idea i suppose if gapps fits your needs
[19:12:43] <Hunterkll> use azure as your source of truth/identity platform
[19:12:55] <Hunterkll> that costs $0 essentially 
[19:12:57] <cryptic1> sounds messy
[19:13:00] <rpifan> they really dont want anything more with azure, i suppose the thought is we will move entirely to mac
[19:13:07] <cryptic1> why though

[19:13:28] <Hunterkll> rpifan: so get jamf cloud to manage your macs... or hell, intune even
[19:13:31] <rpifan> i give advice and i provide ideas but the decisions are taking by the company admins
[19:13:38] <Hunterkll> then you're seamlessly SSOing into gapps using AAD accounts
[19:13:39] <Hunterkll> lol
[19:13:46] <rpifan> my reply to this was to consider either jumpcloud or jamf

[19:15:36] <Hunterkll> rpifan: you kind of need a "neutral" party in this case - some IDP provider, like say, Okta, or Azure 
[19:15:40] <Hunterkll> then federate all your applications to it
[19:15:50] <rpifan> hm okta might be an option
[19:15:52] <Hunterkll> so there's one point of account management no matter what you're using
[19:15:57] <Hunterkll> Okta will incur higher costs
[19:15:59] <Hunterkll> and complexity
[19:16:07] <Hunterkll> and introduce more headaches in the mac environment
[19:16:10] <rpifan> oh yea? my experience of okta is that its pretty easy to use and such
[19:16:21] <Hunterkll> kind of
[19:16:24] <Hunterkll> depends on how it's set up i suppose
[19:16:27] <rpifan> so is it the integration of kta and jamf?

[19:18:08] <rpifan> Hunterkll, i thought jamf would provide user management on a mac?
[19:18:14] <Hunterkll> rpifan: no? 
[19:18:19] <Hunterkll> rpifan: your directory service would do that
[19:18:26] <Hunterkll> or however you set it up
[19:18:31] <Hunterkll> we use local accounts in our environment on the macs
[19:19:03] <rpifan> well how do you get macs to work with azure for user management?
[19:19:04] <Hunterkll> user logs in, maps smart card (yubikey) for MFA login to their local account, signs into the Kerberos SSO extension using their AD credentials so they can access corporate resources as if they're on an AD joined system, and off they go
[19:19:28] <Hunterkll> we're using on-prem AD, but to get to azure resources, they bounce through our on-prem ADFS which authenticates them to Azure for access to our a pplications 
[19:19:33] <Hunterkll> using AD synchronized accounts 
[19:19:36] <PublicWiFi> how is your yubikey mapping work Hunterkll ?
[19:19:44] <PublicWiFi> i've never used them in prod so forgive me if thats a dumb question
[19:20:00] <PublicWiFi> and what kerberos SSO ext do yo uuse?
[19:20:03] <Hunterkll> then they can access our applications, everything from our external timesheet vendor to on-prem sharepoint authentication is handled through Azure 
[19:20:08] <Hunterkll> PublicWiFi: .... the kerberos SSO extension
[19:20:09] <Hunterkll> like
[19:20:10] <Hunterkll> there's only one

[19:29:29] <Hunterkll> then *any* central account solution will work
[19:29:30] <Hunterkll> that's it
[19:29:35] <Hunterkll> read that last link I gave you, it'll explain it
[19:29:36] <csws> best is when your signing certs expire but everyone is kinda clueless so it becomes a shitfest trying to get it updated
[19:29:37] <rpifan> yea
[19:29:46] <PublicWiFi> i reached out to the second in command there to hook him up with this job and he won't take it and it makes me sad
[19:29:48] <rpifan> the question is convincing them to actually impleemtn it
[19:30:05] <Hunterkll> rpifan: hilariously, I have a gsuite/gapps free account I still use, I log into it using an Azure AD account :P
[19:30:23] <rpifan> surprise how htat works
[19:30:30] <Hunterkll> SAML authentication.....
[19:30:36] <Hunterkll> not surprising at all
[19:30:39] <Hunterkll> google supports external IDPs
[19:30:42] <Hunterkll> just like any other cloud vendor
[19:30:49] <Hunterkll> you could log into O365 using gapps accounts if you really wanted to 
[19:30:52] <Hunterkll> for all it matters
[19:30:56] <mistiry> wait you mean it isnt magic?
[19:30:56] <PublicWiFi> i need to set down and figure out how to make my linux boxes auto renew with my internal CA
[19:31:00] <csws> yeah external identities or whatever
[19:31:10] *** Quits: interop_madness (~interop_m@user/interop-madness/x-0950004) (Quit: Leaving)
[19:31:19] <Hunterkll> just a matter of setting it up
[19:31:24] <Haise0> mistiry: impossible, entire IT is magic /s
[19:31:42] <PublicWiFi> PKI looks like black magic to someone who hasn't read up on it
[19:31:43] <csws> PublicWiFi, is your internal CA ADCS?
[19:31:48] <rpifan> if you use jamf and azure, what happens if you are offline
[19:31:48] <spiderman> related, you can run your own ACME CA, LetsEncrypt open-sourced their backend 
[19:31:51] <PublicWiFi> csws: yee
[19:31:57] <Hunterkll> rpifan: .... you just log in like normal?
[19:31:59] <Hunterkll> it caches shit locally
[19:32:09] <PublicWiFi> spiderman: oh that's dope
[19:32:23] <Hunterkll> rpifan: really it comes down to how much you want to separate/centralize shit, and manage it
[19:32:24] <spiderman> yeah its called boulder IIRC
[19:32:38] <csws> PublicWiFi, you could theoretically have openssl generate a CSR then send it off to get signed with certreq on a windows box apparently
[19:32:46] <csws> then take the  response from that and use it to complete the cert and boom
[19:32:47] <spiderman> we used to spin up a boulder server to test our chef cookbooks that requested LE certs
[19:33:17] <Hunterkll> rpifan: gapps for mac login is gonna be retarded to manage, but may end up being cheaper for you and it is *technically* possible
[19:33:25] <PublicWiFi> is there a cert management API I can add?
[19:33:33] <Hunterkll> rpifan: but if you're gonna have windows boxes, now you're gonna have two IDPs 
[19:33:35] <PublicWiFi> idk, ill figure it out one day haha
[19:33:43] <Hunterkll> rpifan: AAD and Gapps, with two sets of accounts
[19:33:44] <PublicWiFi> I'd got... a year at least before i need to renew anything :D
[19:33:51] <csws> lol API
[19:33:52] <sd> 11<H​otmess> Usually saml is json
[19:33:54] <Hunterkll> rpifan: so you gotta pick one, centralize, and have one "sole source of truth"
[19:33:57] <PublicWiFi> csws: :(
[19:33:59] <csws> SAML is XML
[19:34:05] <spiderman> ^^^^
[19:34:13] <PublicWiFi> i mean to automate the request lol
[19:34:15] <rpifan> Hunterkll, yea i agree with you 100 percent
[19:34:27] <spiderman> unfortunately it is XML
[19:34:43] <csws> PublicWiFi, yeah well the tricky part is how to get the CSR to a box to sign
[19:34:45] <Hunterkll> rpifan: you can also sign into windows using google accounts with a bunch of other parts, but then you still have to figure out managing the windows devices at all otherwise
[19:34:53] <PublicWiFi> okay now I gotta think of the security implications of auto-enrolled certs internally
[19:34:54] <csws> SSH daemon on a windows host? lol
[19:35:06] <sd> 11<H​otmess> Oh jwt is json
[19:35:06] <PublicWiFi> yeah that's why an API would be dope
[19:35:07] <Hunterkll> rpifan: but then you're taking management out of systems
[19:35:10] <rpifan> Hunterkll, yea at the moment the windows devices arent really being managed
[19:35:14] <Hunterkll> rpifan: so you're fracturing apart 
[19:35:16] <PublicWiFi> connect to the CA and send the CSR etc
[19:35:19] <csws> make your own API?!
[19:35:22] <PublicWiFi> xD
[19:35:29] <PublicWiFi> IIS CA Renewal API
[19:35:35] <sd> 11<H​otmess> SSH is part of windows 10 now
[19:35:39] <PublicWiFi> still garbage tho
[19:35:42] <sd> 11<H​otmess> Specifically openssh
[19:35:43] <csws> like acme but for retards
[19:35:45] <Hunterkll> rpifan: with AAD, you can provide SSO into gapps using the same account, AND account login to Mac and Windows devices, using one central MFA solution 
[19:35:47] <spiderman> windows doesn't have ssh?
[19:35:48] <PublicWiFi> every time I've tried to use it it sux
[19:35:52] <vinrock> holy shit the little thermal printes i bought in october for $436 are marked up to $582 on the brother website now
[19:35:54] <PublicWiFi> spiderman: yeeee it does now
[19:36:00] <csws> screw that
[19:36:04] * csws installs the telnet server feature
[19:36:05] <sd> 11<H​otmess> Feature on demand
[19:36:09] <PublicWiFi> ^
[19:36:10] <rpifan> Hunterkll, how do you integrate gapps into aad?
[19:36:17] <spiderman> telnet is great as a debugging tool
[19:36:17] <Hunterkll> rpifan: tack on EMS for the windows boxes, now you only have JAMF+InTune+AAD to worry about entirely 
[19:36:21] <Hunterkll> for managing your systems
[19:36:27] <spiderman> nothing wrong with telnet
[19:36:40] <sd> 11<H​otmess> Get-WindowsCapability -Online | Where-Object Name -like 'OpenSSH*'
[19:36:45] <Hunterkll> rpifan: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/google-apps-tutorial
[19:36:48] * spiderman learned how to use telnet in 2018
[19:37:05] <rpifan> they will 100 percent not pay for intune
[19:37:08] <rpifan> so we can forget about that
[19:37:22] <Hunterkll> rpifan: yea, but you'll still need AAD P1 ($6/user/month) for SAML stuff 
[19:37:33] <rpifan> hmm Hunterkll 
[19:37:33] <Hunterkll> but that also gives you all the MFA stuff too
[19:37:34] <Hunterkll> for every system
[19:37:39] <sd> 11<H​otmess> Grab ansible
[19:37:40] <Hunterkll> centralized MFA management, etc 
[19:37:44] <sd> 11<H​otmess> And use it for ssh
[19:37:49] <rpifan> but then we'll also need a soluition for the current macs Hunterkll ?
[19:37:58] <Hunterkll> rpifan: that's JAMF with JAMF Connect
[19:37:58] <rpifan> for management of the mac devices unless intune works with that as well
[19:38:03] <Hunterkll> intune can manage macs
[19:38:14] <rpifan> so we still need to have JAMF + AAD
[19:38:18] <rpifan> + Intune
[19:38:20] <Hunterkll> AAD P1 doesn't include intune, that's just the idenitty stuff 
[19:38:26] <Hunterkll> InTune licenses JUST for the windows boxes
[19:38:40] <Hunterkll> not for everyone
[19:38:50] <rpifan> well i think ill take all the info you gave me and present it to the company bosses so they can make a choice 
[19:38:51] <Hunterkll> but you'll want JAMF / JAMF Connect to allow users to use AAD accounts directly on the mac 
[19:39:05] <Hunterkll> so you can use AAD MFA to  secure/protect all accounts across the board with one single solution 
[19:39:08] <rpifan> yea i think the jamf / jamf connect is very clearly a priority here
[19:39:16] <sd> 09<Q​uasky> Intune scares me.
[19:39:33] <Hunterkll> JAMF connect can also let you use google accounts to log into macs
[19:39:34] <rpifan> in the end for the sake of my sanity id say lets just move all of us to mac and use jamf and be done with it
[19:39:41] <Hunterkll> the problem is when you start using gogole accounts to log into windows machines
[19:39:46] <Hunterkll> and then you're beholden to google's MFA options
[19:39:53] <Hunterkll> which are.... less than impressive 
[19:40:05] <Hunterkll> rpifan: you still need an IDP, be it google or azure or whatever
[19:40:08] <rpifan> well another big concern is we have no device mamagenetn of any kind at m
[19:40:15] <rpifan> yea itll have to be google IDP
[19:40:17] <Hunterkll> so you'll still need JAMF + JAMF Connect + Google 
[19:40:30] <Hunterkll> then you'll ahve to SAML integrate any external vendors to google
[19:40:35] <Hunterkll> and you'll be tied to google forever with no flexibility
[19:40:42] <technonerd> get jamf so you can goto jamf con and visit me
[19:40:44] <Hunterkll> well, that's not entirely true, but 
[19:40:47] <PublicWiFi> can't wait to kick this fuckin email to exchange online
[19:40:54] <Hunterkll> it makes life more difficutl
[19:41:00] <PublicWiFi> so i can stop stressing over exchange CVEs
[19:41:01] <sd> 14<K​illnine> We migrated last week. It's been amazing 😄
[19:41:03] <Hunterkll> I like to separate my IDP from everything else essentially
[19:41:16] <Hunterkll> even if we ditch everything microsoft, we'd still be using AAD for sign in to everything
[19:41:17] <Hunterkll> lol
[19:41:25] <PublicWiFi> I see "exchange" and "CVE" in the same sentence and my asshole takes a bite out of my chair
[19:41:47] <Hunterkll> rpifan: it's a world of many options you can mix and match 
[19:41:58] <rpifan> yea and sometimes so many opptions is bad
[19:41:59] <sd> 14<K​illnine> You'll still need to manage Exchange hybrid server, more than likely. But at least you can close port 443 and more-or-less cut off Exchange from public access
[19:42:13] <Hunterkll> you can use Azure AD accounts ot log into linux systems these days :P 
[19:42:18] <Hunterkll> in this case it's great
[19:42:19] <rpifan> hence why my psychologist once told me the older you get the easier it is, it would seem like having less choice when you get old is worse but it isnt really
[19:42:25] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> fuck not paying attention during a meeting and then someone says
[19:42:25] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> "What do you thing bdenlinger?"
[19:42:31] <Hunterkll> because you can mix and match what you need, and it's all standards based so they can all integrate in a billion directions
[19:42:38] <rpifan> ohhh train is moving
[19:42:41] <Hunterkll> the problem gets to when you get down to the individual endpoints
[19:42:43] <sd> 10<n​emisys> yeah I hate when that happens
[19:42:45] <rpifan> i hope i will make it to my face filling appointment
[19:42:52] <Hunterkll> and managing/configuring the actual systems in users hands
[19:42:59] <Hunterkll> and having those systems to seamless SSO to your assets
[19:43:03] <rpifan> technonerd, well jamf we will for sure get
[19:43:06] <Hunterkll> and managing MFA for those assets/accounts
[19:43:06] <rpifan> when and where is jamfcon
[19:43:14] <rpifan> do you also make jelly as well as jam there
[19:43:22] <Hunterkll> rpifan: JAMF Connect is a pay-for addon that you'll need in addition to JAMF Pro 
[19:43:32] <rpifan> Hunterkll, ohh thanks for letting me
[19:43:37] <Hunterkll> that's what will provide the login integration with the macs 
[19:43:41] <Hunterkll> and the SSO functionality 
[19:43:46] <rpifan> im gonna write this down less i forgot, you hve provide me with a good overview here
[19:43:49] <Hunterkll> otherwise they'll have to log in via web browser and shit
[19:44:08] <PublicWiFi> @Killnine yeah as long as its only reaching out TO azure I'm cool with it
[19:44:13] <Hunterkll> rpifan: lol it's almost like we have 100+ federated apps
[19:44:14] <PublicWiFi> no more internal connections lol
[19:44:14] <Hunterkll> :D
[19:44:20] <PublicWiFi> s/internal/incoming
[19:44:21] <layer8> PublicWiFi meant: "no more incoming connections lol"
[19:44:37] <Hunterkll> eh
[19:44:45] <Hunterkll> hybrid exchange still needs to communicate with O365 both ways
[19:44:51] <PublicWiFi> @Killnine hey the server you have to keep is barebones af right? No mailbox data is saved or anything?
[19:44:51] <Hunterkll> even SMTP 
[19:44:54] <PublicWiFi> Hunterkll: ew....
[19:45:01] <Hunterkll> but yes
[19:45:17] <PublicWiFi> so I can make it a shitty ass VM with limited resources :D
[19:45:21] <Hunterkll> it's no on-prem mailboxes, just a one final exchange server hosting no data, you're basically running it to have access to ECP
[19:45:32] <sd> 14<K​illnine> ^^^
[19:45:35] <Hunterkll> PublicWiFi: Exchange 2019 won't start without 11GB ram allocated to the VM as the max ram limit 
[19:45:40] <rpifan> Hunterkll, so what did we say then for device management on the macs? intune
[19:46:02] <PublicWiFi> Hunterkll: lol ofc
[19:46:03] <technonerd> rpifan: its usually oct-nov timeframe in minneapolis 
[19:46:09] <sd> 14<K​illnine> Theres SUPPOSED to be some replacement for the Exchange Hybrid model coming out (announce 2020 Ignite) but not heard about it in a long time
[19:46:09] <rpifan> ahh
[19:46:14] <Hunterkll> rpifan: jamf with jamf connect if you want to use AAD or any other *supported* IDP accounts to log into the mac driectly, if you want to just use intune you'll be using local mac accounts + company portal app signed in 
[19:46:21] <rpifan> im really hoping to no go back to the us at all sorry technonerd 
[19:46:27] <AnonymooseReddtr> killnine yeah i haven't heard anything more about that 
[19:46:36] <technonerd> nov is when dvs1 does his birthday all night set, JUST SAYING
[19:46:39] <Hunterkll> yea it'll come before the EOL of Exchange 2016 
[19:46:41] <Hunterkll> no big deal
[19:46:50] <Hunterkll> they're not exactly in a rush
[19:46:58] <Hunterkll> got a few more years before it becomes even remotely an issue :P
[19:47:12] <rpifan> Hunterkll, how about for deploying software and such? we were using munki server at the previous previous all mac company
[19:47:14] <rpifan> it worked quite well
[19:47:22] <Hunterkll> rpifan: intune and jamf can both do that
[19:47:27] <rpifan> it coudl even send out those apple equivalent of gpos 
[19:47:34] <Hunterkll> rpifan: intune and jamf can both do that
[19:47:37] <PublicWiFi> im just ready to not sweat AS MUCH when I see Exchange CVE's
[19:47:38] <rpifan> i forget what they call those in apple lamnd
[19:47:39] <PublicWiFi> that better? :P
[19:47:40] <Hunterkll> hell so can vmware airwatch
[19:47:43] <Hunterkll> rpifan: configuration profiles
[19:47:46] <rpifan> yeaa those
[19:48:04] <Hunterkll> PublicWiFi: I don't sweat at all when I see them, I just install patches at a decent pace and don't worry :P
[19:48:15] <Hunterkll> PublicWiFi: and keep the security features built into stuff turned on 
[19:48:16] <PublicWiFi> well my current environment is....
[19:48:16] <Hunterkll> :D
[19:48:21] <PublicWiFi> shit
[19:48:23] <PublicWiFi> xD
[19:48:26] <vinrock> any you guys like to nerd out on train engines check out the ge transportation facility in erie, pa on google earth
[19:48:34] <vinrock> theres a bazillion different engines all over this place
[19:48:36] * PublicWiFi looks at csws
[19:48:36] <vinrock> its kinda neat
[19:48:44] <PublicWiFi> train engines are dope
[19:48:46] <Hunterkll> PublicWiFi: heck exchange these days has a built in rapid-fix delivery service that isn't the full patch, but neuters/mitigates exploits before you even hear about them basically
[19:48:53] <vinrock> this is a good google earf find
[19:49:00] <csws> PublicWiFi, what!
[19:49:06] <csws> oh
[19:49:09] <csws> did you get the new box
[19:49:11] <PublicWiFi> talking about my less-than-ideal exchange setup
[19:49:15] <PublicWiFi> not yet, I'm working on it
[19:49:19] <csws> maybe some day
[19:49:21] <rpifan> Hunterkll, thanks for all the tips, if you are ever in europe let me know
[19:49:21] <Hunterkll> PublicWiFi: you obvoiusly still need to patch in case they figure out ways around it, but it basically throws a wrench in the exploit path l ol
[19:49:26] <csws> oh dude
[19:49:28] <Hunterkll> rpifan: i'll be in iceland in may
[19:49:28] <Hunterkll> lol
[19:49:31] <csws> PublicWiFi, my homeprod exchange box got mega fried
[19:49:34] <rpifan> i do wanna go to iceland
[19:49:35] <PublicWiFi> I'm hoping next year honestly
[19:49:35] <csws> like totally unbootable
[19:49:36] <rpifan> on the famous ferry
[19:49:38] <PublicWiFi> csws: LOL what did you do?
[19:49:42] <csws> and then I went to restore it and the veeam SQL database was also fried
[19:49:42] <csws> ffs
[19:49:46] <PublicWiFi> also how do you run email at home 
[19:49:51] <PublicWiFi> does your ISP not block port 25?
[19:49:54] <csws> my brother flipped the breakers a bajillion times when replacing light switches and didn't tell me taht was his intention
[19:49:55] <PublicWiFi> LOL wow!
[19:49:57] <rpifan> Hunterkll, also if you do have any contacts in japan i hope to move to tokyo next year by september
[19:49:57] <Hunterkll> but yea PublicWiFi https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-releases-one-click-mitigation-tool-for-exchange-server-hacks/
[19:49:59] <csws> like he'd replace one, flip the breaker to test.. repeat
[19:50:04] <PublicWiFi> where's your battery backup? :P
[19:50:05] <SirSceptalot> I'm off, D&D session tonight. Later alligator
[19:50:09] <csws> no UPS down the shed :(
[19:50:11] <csws> only in the house
[19:50:11] <PublicWiFi> Hunterkll: oh interesting I haven't seen then
[19:50:14] <Hunterkll> rpifan: a fair amount, but probably nothing that'd help you like that
[19:50:18] <Hunterkll> PublicWiFi: yea it's been out for almost a year now 
[19:50:19] <Hunterkll> :P
[19:50:21] <PublicWiFi> rip
[19:50:25] <csws> I thought he was going to just switch it off, do teh work then back on.. but nope
[19:50:35] <PublicWiFi> last year I learned my exchagn box was like 10 CU behind if you don't remember
[19:50:39] <Hunterkll> PublicWiFi: basically like, if "X" is vulnerable, they'll deploy a rapid fix (if you leave auto apply on) that might break feature Y, but protects you until you can install the patch 
[19:50:40] <Hunterkll> lol
[19:50:43] <PublicWiFi> fuckin old admin man, i'm STILL finding his bullshit 2 years later
[19:51:01] <csws> anyway I had to use VBK extract to manually grab a backup of the veeam box, upload that to vmware then restore exchange after I got veeam going
[19:51:02] <PublicWiFi> Hunterkll: i might just do this
[19:51:05] <Activ8> that's a lot of bullshit
[19:51:18] <Hunterkll> PublicWiFi: works for 2013, 2016, and 2019 
[19:51:26] <PublicWiFi> ofc I have a reverse proxy in front of my exchange box but that doesn't do TOO much mitigation
[19:51:28] <PublicWiFi> but every little bit counts
[19:51:40] <Hunterkll> any decent WAF is good enough i guess
[19:51:40] <Hunterkll> lol
[19:51:53] <csws> oh also PublicWiFi I do have port 25 allowed with the ISP but I don't use it tbh.. I have SES setup as the relay on port 587
[19:51:57] <csws> err smart host I guess
[19:52:04] <PublicWiFi> I need to do some reading on exchange and the data it senders, header info and shit
[19:52:11] <csws> hey PublicWiFi i'm sure i'll have another 0 day to send you shortly
[19:52:11] <PublicWiFi> so i can config nginx to block abnormal shit
[19:52:20] <PublicWiFi> csws: oh nice!
[19:52:23] <PublicWiFi> csws: and not nice!
[19:52:36] <rpifan> Hunterkll, im also a certified english / spanish teacher
[19:52:39] <rpifan> its what i studied in university
[19:52:52] <Hunterkll> PublicWiFi: first just block /ecp url :P
[19:53:04] <rpifan> this chat has been really education, im happy to bill my company for it. 2 hours chat iwth Hunterkll thatll be 100 euro please
[19:53:05] <csws> wtf no
[19:53:12] <csws> what if i want to admin it on cafe wireless while enjoying a latte?!
[19:53:20] <Hunterkll> ... VPN you little shit
[19:53:25] <sintax> ^^
[19:53:26] <Alternity> there is always that one guy in standup who will not shut up  :D
[19:53:37] <Alternity> and talks really slow
[19:53:41] <rpifan> Hunterkll, oh speaking of vpn how do i integrate the unifi vpn with azure ad and / or gapps?
[19:53:57] <csws> Alternity, yeah I worked with a guy who'd rant about drivers for like 40 mins when building new images
[19:53:58] <csws> drove me nuts
[19:54:04] <Alternity> unless there is a native unifi intergration prob need to use RADIUS (shudder)
[19:54:05] <Hunterkll> AAD is probably pretty easy - done it with lots of VPN stuff, no clue about gapps, i'd have to look into that

[19:54:24] <Hunterkll> why shudder? that';s the simplest solution
[19:54:28] <Alternity> idk i just dont like it
[19:54:29] <Hunterkll> a small NPS instance with the AAD MFA extension 
[19:54:33] <Alternity> NPS omg D:
[19:54:47] <Hunterkll> boom, done, anything is now AAD account-enabled and MFA'd 
[19:55:25] <rpifan> yea i know for a fact i need a radius server
[19:55:31] <csws> NPS is fine geez
[19:55:36] <rpifan> unifi has both an internal radius server and support an external radius server
[19:55:39] <Alternity> it just looks so old
[19:55:39] <csws> y'know what's cool about NPS
[19:55:40] <Hunterkll> rpifan: you actually don't though 
[19:55:41] <Hunterkll> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/unifi-tutorial
[19:55:42] <csws> right click -> export
[19:55:46] <csws> then import on another side
[19:55:48] <Alternity> NPS feels like it was made in 1995
[19:55:49] <csws> and that's it
[19:55:52] <csws> so fucking nice
[19:55:52] <Hunterkll> rpifan: if you have AAD P1 
[19:55:59] <csws> yeah Alternity which is why it actually works
[19:56:02] <Hunterkll> Alternity: yea, but it's not like standards change, and it just works, so 
[19:56:03] <Hunterkll> lol
[19:56:07] <Alternity> i'm just complaining :D
[19:56:21] <rpifan> i see
[19:56:22] <Hunterkll> Alternity is aiming for a C-level positon these days
[19:56:32] <rpifan> i wonder if those unifi users then are integrated into the vpn
[19:56:38] <rpifan> since its an l2tp vpn with a radius server
[19:56:48] <rpifan> i need to get the identities from somehere i think
[19:56:55] <Hunterkll> your radius server is providing the IDs somehow
[19:56:57] <rpifan> unless you can write a saml thing for unifi too
[19:57:05] <csws> wow 12:30 and already starting to expire
[19:57:06] <Hunterkll> rpifan: ... i just linked a SAML thing 
[19:57:06] <Hunterkll> :P
[19:57:08] <csws> is this what happens when you get old?
[19:57:10] <Hunterkll> do you like, have AD synchronizing to AAD ?
[19:57:16] <Hunterkll> because then you might have a windows radius server providing accounts
[19:57:23] <Hunterkll> using on-prem AD identities 
[19:57:27] <rpifan> no we dont have any ad or management of user devices at all
[19:57:31] <Hunterkll> or you might be using something like FreeRADIUS synchronziing to something else
[19:57:40] <rpifan> all devices are entirely unmanaged
[19:57:54] <rpifan> and apple devices have no oversight at all what so ever ppl just use their private iclod to login
[19:58:03] <rpifan> we also have laptops for everyone
[19:58:21] <rpifan> and most of our workforce is remote and especially with the new german cases i wont see anyone for months i feel like again
[19:58:38] <Hunterkll> look
[19:58:55] <Hunterkll> 150eur/hr and a case of whiskey and i'll have this entire th ing done in a weekend
[19:58:56] <Hunterkll> lol
[19:59:08] <rpifan> how many hours do you need

[21:08:28] <Hunterkll> yea to express isn't really a valid route
[21:08:35] <Hunterkll> you could mount a database if it's within express size limits though
[21:08:40] <Hunterkll> and it should upgrade the schema/version
[21:08:46] <Hunterkll> but no inplace upgrade route
[21:09:10] <Hunterkll> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/install-windows/supported-version-and-edition-upgrades-version-15?view=sql-server-ver15
[21:16:10] <sd> 08<S​ubaru(Alcyone)> the problem I have is that the client doesn't have/need a standard license
[21:16:22] <sd> 08<S​ubaru(Alcyone)> and support will only do the upgrade/migration from 2008r2 with a standard version
[21:16:33] <sd> 08<S​ubaru(Alcyone)> but the database is only 3GB big and they aren't using any of the features
[21:16:46] <sd> 08<S​ubaru(Alcyone)> i guess i could just export and import the database manually?
[21:18:10] <Hunterkll> that's what i said, just mount it if it's within size limits (and a supported upgrade path such as what i linked for version compatiblity)
[21:18:28] <Hunterkll> obviously we don't care about editions in this case, but still, has to be at least DB version 2012 or higher to go to 2019 
[21:18:30] <sd> 08<S​ubaru(Alcyone)> oh oops sorry
[21:18:41] <sd> 08<S​ubaru(Alcyone)> yeah he's bringing it to 2014 for me
[21:18:47] <sd> 08<S​ubaru(Alcyone)> i'll just do 2014 to 2019 once he's done
[21:18:53] <Hunterkll> if it's 2008 R2 then you mount it on a 2014, let it upgrade, then mount it on 2019 and let it upgrade
[21:19:15] <sd> 08<S​ubaru(Alcyone)> hmm so i should probably stop him
[21:19:29] <sd> 08<S​ubaru(Alcyone)> so i don't have to deal with 2014 standard to 2019 express

[21:34:54] <Hunterkll> it doesn't matter
[21:35:03] <Hunterkll> you take the 2014 upgraded DB and mount it to the 2019 instance
[21:35:09] <Hunterkll> what matters is DB and engine version 
[21:35:11] <Hunterkll> not edition
[21:35:18] <Hunterkll> edition only matters for in place upgrades of the installed SQL instance

[21:48:22] <sd> 06<C​omputer man, fix my pants!> But a good starting point is to have a completely separate environment and restore from backup periodically
[21:48:35] <sd> 06<C​omputer man, fix my pants!> That way you test your backups as well

[21:51:53] <JollyRgrs> if you don't have backups... you should be worrying about that more than a dev. environment
