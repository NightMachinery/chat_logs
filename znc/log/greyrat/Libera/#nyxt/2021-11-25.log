[12:24:58] <tom42> Is safebrowsing used in Nyxt? Is it configurable? I couldn't see anything in the docs/issues/PRs.
[12:26:03] <tom42> Nothing in the code either, and it's not the sort of thing I'd expect in webkit.
[12:54:00] <aartaka> tom42: do you mean Google Safe Browsing? No, we do not use it. Adding support for it should be relatively easy — it would basically be an extension of blocker-mode. Should this belong to the core of Nyxt? I'm not sure.
[12:55:49] <aartaka> mariari,Kabouik: ask and you shall receive: I've just pushed a patch that makes pasting into prompt-buffer to not rewrite the prompt-buffer contents!
[13:04:48] <Kabouik> Awesome aartaka, thanks! I like that kind of good surprises. :>
[13:05:43] <Kabouik> > ask and you shall receive: beware, I have many things to ask on my list
[13:06:08] <Kabouik> You should be careful not spoiling me with delivering something that easily, I'll get used to it
[13:06:48] <Kabouik> By the way, while you were at it, did you enable suport for home/end kind of key inputs in the prompt-buffer text field?
[13:19:23] <Kabouik> I see that home/end are actually applying to the prompt-buffer items even when the cursor is in the text field, maybe that's by design
[13:20:02] <Kabouik> Perhaps something like c-a and c-e could be used to move the cursor to the beginning or end of the line then, just like in shell
[13:40:24] *** Joins: pjb (~pjb@user/pjb)
[14:07:33] <aartaka> Kabouik: C-e and C-a do make sense, yes!
[14:27:31] <aartaka> Kabouik: I'm spoiling you, but movement to the start and end of line are already on master, along with the forward-(char|word) and backward-(char|word) movement!

[15:23:22] <edgarvincent[m]> Thank you very much, aartaka.
[15:24:44] <edgarvincent[m]> (off-topic, but I've never really understood what one was supposed to do in the Emacs minibuffer for copy and pasting while in evil-mode. I use S-Insert, but I wish I could switch to normal-state like Nyxt does)

[17:36:44] <Kabouik> Speaking of prompt-buffer text field, it doesn't recognize subdomains as urls unless one types https://
[17:37:52] <Kabouik> Meaning if you type sub-domain.domain.com, it'll search for it in ddg and there is no option to go directly to that url
[17:37:59] <Kabouik> At least when the subdomain contains an hyphen
[17:38:19] <Kabouik> Just tried en.wikipedia.org and there it does offer to reach that url directly, so the hyphen is the issue
[17:42:06] <Kabouik> aartaka, regarding e889dcf899052fe0cfbc761a2f66729998933c0d: awesome! One thing though, C-a is now used to reach beginning of line, but it was selecting all before. I think there's nothing for selecting all now. Personally I think that is a minor issue because if I want to copy the URL, I would <y u> outside the prompt-buffer instead of <:> <c-a> <c-c>, but some may miss it. However, what is missing is <c-k> and <c-u> keybindings if you're going the
[17:42:06] <Kabouik> shell way
[17:42:22] <Kabouik> Those normally delete everything to the right of the cursor or to the left of the cursor, respectively.
[17:44:08] <Kabouik> Without them and without select-all keybind, I think it's no longer possible to delete the current text field all at once, and spamming backspace/delete is the only way
[17:44:48] <aartaka> Kabouik: yes, C-u and C-k could've been there too, but I've been lazy about it :)
[17:45:12] <aartaka> But the problem with C-a is indeed a serious one.
[17:46:19] <aartaka> Kabouik: if you use VI map, then there are '^' and '$' for the start and of line :)
[17:46:30] <aartaka> In case you are used to the vi way there.
[17:47:08] *** Parts: pranavats (3fba1d1b34@jabberfr.org) ()
[17:48:23] <Kabouik> The subdomain issue is totally unrelated to this commit but it's serious one too: I have no way to reach that freaking subdomain of my employer's website to plan my holidays! I mean I literally can't force Nyxt to consider it an url even if it suggests what I type is a search term, because the set-url command doesn't offer anything else than search engines
[17:48:37] <Kabouik> I am not used to the vi map, I'm learning with Nyxt!
[17:50:25] <Kabouik> Well that's really weird. Sometimes it does offer me to reach the url. I don't understand how to reproduce the issue.
[17:51:54] <aartaka> Kabouik: select-all binding done. `C-x h` is the binding for both Emacs and VI maps, as VI seems to have no select-all command :)
[17:53:10] <aartaka> Kabouik: Yeah, the mechanism for URL resolving is complex. I haven't expected that such a simple thing as boring adress bar has so much quirks behind it xD
[17:53:29] <aartaka> But it should not err the way it does for you.

[18:02:36] <mariari> oh going to the start and end of the line works with keys now?
[18:02:49] <aartaka> mariari: Yes!
[18:02:50] <mariari> my old binding for that was a bit faulty
[18:02:52] <mariari> perfect
[18:09:28] <Kabouik> Cool stuff, thanks a lot aartaka
[18:09:58] <Kabouik> Yeah I can imagine the url-prompt is complex because I can't even understand how to reproduce my issue with subdomains and hyphens, but it does occur more often than not
[19:01:39] <edgarvincent[m]> hm, I'm getting `libsoup-ERROR **: 16:30:59.176: libsoup2 symbols detected. Using libsoup2 and libsoup3 in the same process is not supported.` with latest master

[23:27:11] <florhizome[m]> just as my fairphone got UT support ^.-
[23:28:17] <waleee> nice. I think I will go chinese with a oneplus though, mostly because cost considerations
[23:28:23] <florhizome[m]> So what do you want/need for it would be the best question i guess and at which price
[23:29:45] <florhizome[m]> i think that's alright ;)
[23:29:45] <florhizome[m]> If the pinephone wouldn't pack such a huge punch of cool stuff i would consider that too
[23:31:57] <waleee> they have some models for sale during black friday here.
