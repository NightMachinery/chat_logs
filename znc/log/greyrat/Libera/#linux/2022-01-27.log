[02:01:29] <jim> I dunno, but it would seem to me, that's probably the easiest approach, especially if you're familiar with it

[18:39:30] <MrElendig> nabakolu: on selfhosted they are often the same, but for larger installs they are often seperated
[18:39:43] <labrador> ayecee, ok so I understand that
[18:39:47] <koollman> generally I consider those 'functional parts' : email reception (from other mail servers), email filtering, email sending, email storage, email access (from clients), email submission (from clients)

[18:41:05] *** Quits: Swant (~swant@libera/staff/swant) (Quit: gone to IKEA)
[18:41:06] <koollman> and, in general, you have at least two different systems to consider, for reception/sending/submission, and for email access. And they must agree on storage

[18:41:13] <ayecee> they don't have to be different machines.
[18:41:23] <labrador> ayecee, I guess yeah.
[18:41:26] <koollman> they don't have to be different servers or even different programs
[18:41:39] <koollman> But understanding which program covers which part(s) helps

[18:42:18] <kurahaupo> labrador: from the mail client to the first MTA usually involves SMTP AUTH; after that from MTA to MTA is just SMTP; then from the last MTA to the client is either IMAP or POP

[18:44:10] <nabakolu> I feel like the solution koollman suggested is the go to for selfhosted email
[18:44:13] <labrador> koollman, thats lesser number of servers
[18:44:20] <MrElendig> labrador: if you are running a smtp server, you must use auth, otherwise some random person will turn your server into a spambot and get you banned off the internet
[18:44:20] <labrador> So I would probably do taht
[18:44:29] <MrElendig> auth only*
[18:44:38] <kurahaupo> The exception where you don't auth is because you've told your MTA to trust your client's IP address
[18:44:43] *** Quits: Atque (~Atque@user/atque) (Quit: ...)
[18:44:47] <MrElendig> also, don't make your server a open relay
[18:44:53] <labrador> MrElendig, yeah I have heard the main problem is with other MTAs bouncing your emails
[18:44:54] <ayecee> which is a form of implicit auth, i guess
[18:44:54] <ananke> and after many days of painstaking effort of initial setup, monthly maintenance and dealing with spam, you end up being able to do literally the same thing you can do now: send/receive e-mail
[18:44:56] <koollman> nabakolu: I would say it's the go to for 'classical' selfhosted. There are many 'all in one' programs to do it too
[18:44:58] <labrador> To get off blocklists
[18:45:19] <nabakolu> Yea you need some special DNS records and a reverse dns record for the ip

[18:45:40] <hexnewbie> Configuring an SMTP server is more tricky than just the AUTH, you must accept incoming mail without the auth, outgoing *only* with it, and if you have a secondary server, it needs to know the user list on the primary, otherwise it will create backscatter spam and ban you from the internet even if it isn't an open relay

[19:51:20] <Guest69> https://bpa.st/N6UQ
[19:51:39] <pyzozord> I tried different DOCKER_HOST and also tried directly with the ctr tool also givinig it different -adress flags
[19:51:52] <pyzozord> I'm not sure how to solve this myself, I'm too inexperienced with linux stuff

[21:56:14] <ananke> kulak: depends on your 'backup' program. many have 'do not cross into other filesystems' option
