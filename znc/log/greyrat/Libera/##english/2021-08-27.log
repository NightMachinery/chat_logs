[09:16:10] <zumba_addict> ah
[09:16:19] <pussipupu> "our ops team are drunk in the basement again"
[09:16:25] <hoglahoo> xD
[09:16:28] <zumba_addict> i'm reading my chat with my officemate
[09:16:38] <pussipupu> automation team sorry
[09:17:26] <zumba_addict> he told me "our next project was to rebuilt the ui pipeline. I was going to ask you to help with that. Now because Scott left, I think we just have to keep the lights on for a bit"
[09:17:41] <zumba_addict> that's the sentence before the sentence i posted earlier
[09:17:55] <zumba_addict> rebuilt->rebuild
[09:19:39] <hoglahoo> I was hoping more details would help, but I think it just complicated the riddle a little for me
[09:19:55] <zumba_addict> https://bpa.st/RI2Q
[09:20:21] <hoglahoo> eh
[09:20:54] <hoglahoo> my impression would be that your mate doesnt want/need your help now due to Scott's departure
[09:21:24] <zumba_addict> on fixing the pipeline that will be used by automation team, right?
[09:21:26] <hoglahoo> "just have to keep the lights on" could mean they cant cancel the project, but it is on hold.  I am speculating a little
[09:21:30] <zumba_addict> if so, that's how I understood it
[09:21:30] *** Quits: kerfluffy (~kerfluffy@user/kerfluffy) (Quit: My iMac has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[09:21:44] <zumba_addict> yes, that's what I thought too
[09:21:50] <hoglahoo> I dont know who is using it, those details are not addressed in that text
[09:22:45] <zumba_addict> so the pipeline or we call it ci/cd won't have an upgrade since I was suppose to do that. However, since Scott left, I must take care of what Scott is doing because it's more important than the ci/cd
[09:23:01] <hoglahoo> ah
[09:23:21] <zumba_addict> now I understand
[09:23:23] <zumba_addict> :)
[09:24:03] <hoglahoo> so they need you to focus on other items for now because they dont have the luxury of extra worker
[09:24:17] <zumba_addict> got it
[09:24:19] <hoglahoo> doing all they can to keep the basic necessities (the lights on) going
[09:24:24] <zumba_addict> yep

[15:20:10] <tinsoldier> lockdown — Noun: 1. The confinement of people in their own rooms (e.g., in a school) or cells (in a prison), or to their own homes or areas (e.g., in the case of a city- or nation-wide issue) as a security measure after or amid a disturbance or pandemic, etc., 2.

[15:24:56] <dTal> "dash" implies that the short duration comes from a hurried pace, as opposed to a short distance
[15:25:20] <tinwhiskers> maybe, although it's often used to refer to short trips
[15:25:28] <tinwhiskers> as it, it's not used for long trips

[19:10:06] <huf> the one with "yeah" needs a comma surely
[19:10:16] <TechTest> when some stupid interviewers ask that so called question "what are your salary expextations?" what do they actually expect as an answer? to tell them the highest salary rate possible to prove you are confident to your skills or to tell them the lowest to prove you really want that job regardless of anything?
[19:10:48] <bin> well "it should yeah" withotu a comma doesn't make any sense
[19:11:01] <bin> so either it's nonsense or didn't properly type the pause
[19:11:30] <bin> TechTest: they want your honest salary expectations
[19:12:20] <TechTest> bin: I really doubt  that
[19:12:52] <TechTest> no one is going to say no to a higher salary, so everyone always expects more

[19:17:22] <TimMc> TechTest: They want you to give an answer first so that they can be sure not to offer too much higher than it.
[19:17:46] <TimMc> If you get them to name a number first, there's a decent chance it will be a lot higher than what you expected, which is beneficial to you.
[19:18:29] <TechTest> I'd expect the salary rate is fixed and employers won't offer more or less money depending on the candidate
[19:18:59] <TechTest> actually most of the time I answered this question the actual salary ended up being a lot lower 
[19:19:21] <TimMc> It's a game to see who will yield first and name a number, because that gives an advantage to the other side.
[19:19:37] <TechTest> so even though I did not answer their answered correctly they did approve my interview and offered me the job
[19:20:15] <TimMc> My answer is a bit cynical, and there are actually legitimate non-sneaky reasons for them to ask, but this is how it works in many, many places.
[19:20:18] <TechTest> that makes me really wonder the purpose of this question
[19:20:37] <TimMc> OK, there are two purposes:
[19:20:52] <TechTest> TimMc: that's true, most interviewers ask the same questions 
[19:21:36] <TechTest> so the more interviews you had the more expierienced you are, but that obviously doesn't make your actual work skills better
[19:22:19] <TimMc> 1) Interviewing is very expensive for the company. There's a pre-approved *range* of salaries they can offer you, and they don't want to go through the whole interviewing process and then find out that your firm lower bound is above that range, because then both sides have wasted a lot of time.
[19:22:24] <TimMc> ^ this is the legitimate reason
[19:23:23] <TimMc> 2) There's information asymmetry; the company knows more about market rate for the position than you do. They want to pay you as little as possible, and by asking you to name a number first they find out just how far they can low-ball you without being insulting.
[19:23:58] <TimMc> ^ this is the sneaky reason, the one that means you *must not give a numeric answer* if you want to be paid appropriately
[19:24:20] <TimMc> Neither of these have anything to do with actual job skills.
[19:24:51] <bin> if I were asked my salary expectations then I would tell them waht they are, it's not meant to be a trick question.
[19:26:25] <TechTest> TimMc: I actually think interviews are a waste of time anyway because if employers included the salary rate in the job description they would only have applicants who are interested to work for that salary
[19:27:25] <TimMc> TechTest: Yes, that would solve problem #1 but would make #2 worse.
[19:27:32] <TimMc> which is why they don't do it
[19:27:56] <TechTest> in most interviews, I had they either told me the salary at the end of the interview or I had to ask and more in most cases I told them right there that I'm not interested after both of us have wasted 30 minutes on that interview 
[19:28:00] <TimMc> bin: You can't tell from the outside whether it's a trick question or not. It varies by company.
[19:28:20] <bin> TimMc: I said it's not meant to be a trick question
[19:28:26] <bin> if companies are using it a trick question then fuck em
[19:28:30] <bin> you don't want to work there anyway
[19:28:31] <TimMc> Well, they are.
[19:28:35] <TimMc> and fuck 'em
[19:28:53] <TimMc> but that's markets and information asymmetry, that's the world we live in
[19:29:04] <TimMc> https://web.archive.org/web/20200426112429/http://valerieaurora.org/howto_salary/ is a great piece about how and why to negotiate salary
[19:29:11] <TechTest> bin: that's most companies actually 
[19:29:23] *** Joins: kerfluffy (~kerfluffy@user/kerfluffy)
[19:29:39] <TimMc> In the US at least, government and university positions usually have salary listed up front, which is nice.
[19:29:55] <bin> TimMc: no they don't lol
[19:30:07] <TimMc> Not in raw numbers, but close enough.
[19:30:21] <bin> academic positions never have the salary listed on the job posting
[19:30:33] <TimMc> There's a lookup table for assessed skill level and position code that tells you salary.
[19:30:33] <TechTest> they have other tricky questions not relevant to the position itself like "what's your most important skill" or "why do you want ton work for our company"
[19:31:06] <TechTest> these questions are so popular that anyone who has gone through a couple interviews in their life can answer them 
[19:31:31] <bin> TimMc: in some cases but not all. Usually I look on glassdoor but it's an estimate
[19:31:41] <TechTest> and I bet no one ever answered the truth
[19:33:03] <bin> I like those questions because it's a good way to finagle your answer to be what they want to hear
[19:33:05] <bin> like
[19:33:11] <bin> "what is your greatest weakness?"
[19:33:15] <huf> I didnt tell my bosses the truth during the interview (dont remember if they actually asked this stupid shit) but later on I did tell them that I wanted to work here for the money
[19:33:19] <huf> because I dont like starving
[19:33:22] <bin> "Sometimes, I just have TOO MUCH attention to detail"
[19:33:52] <huf> but I did swear a lot during the interview, the idea being that I swear a lot anyway, so if they dont like that, I wouldnt enjoy working for them
[19:34:12] <TimMc> Here's a random example: https://careers.hrm.northeastern.edu/en-us/job/507591/clinical-operations-manager

[19:35:03] <TimMc> min $48,645 midpoint $65,670 max $82,695
[19:35:42] <bin> right, not every university has that
[19:35:43] <TimMc> which is a huge range in this case, but the point is you get it up front
[19:36:04] <TimMc> Hmm. I don't know which ones have it or don't.
[19:36:20] <TimMc> Anyway, the gov't jobs certainly have it.
[19:36:32] <bin> Cornell doesn't
[19:36:41] <bin> several others don't as well

[19:40:34] <TimMc> Mmm, might be paid per course
[19:40:55] <TechTest> bin: right you can make a skill seem like a weakness, so they know that even your weaknesses are good :P
[19:40:56] <bin> my point is that it's not listed upfront
[19:41:11] <huf> TechTest: eh, they wont believe you
[19:41:18] <bin> TechTest: exactly, it's all about how you phrase things
[19:41:20] <huf> it's an elaborate dance where both sides know it's mostly bullshit
[19:41:22] <TechTest> I always answer "my perfectionism" :D
[19:41:23] <huf> but they do it anyway
[19:41:31] <bin> huf: hiring managers love that shit
[19:42:15] <huf> but *do* they? or are they just desperately trying to find out real information about the interviewee, but cant because when you get down to it, people need money to survive
[19:42:21] <huf> so it's an inherently hostile situation
[19:42:24] <TechTest> huf: no one will ever answer the truth, everyone always answer something like "perfectionism", "attention to details", "passion  with my work" etc
[19:42:52] <huf> bin: though... yeah, I could believe it
[19:43:00] <TechTest> if your strongest weakness is being late or losing your temper you are obviously not going ton say that
[19:43:02] <huf> our former Top Manager liked horoscopes for nerds
[19:43:06] <huf> (MBTI)
[19:43:09] <bin> ewwww
[19:43:14] <bin> MBTI is the WORST
[19:43:26] <huf> nah, it's not worse than astrology
[19:43:32] <huf> or skull measuring
[19:43:44] <huf> what's that one called, phrenology?
[19:43:51] <TechTest> huf: they could simply ask questions regarding the actual position, like what would you do in case... and describe a real work scenario 
[19:44:09] <huf> TechTest: the people who do the hiring dont actually know what the job is
[19:44:10] <bin> i think it's worse than astrology because people think that it's science 
[19:44:14] <huf> in larger companies at least
[19:44:17] <huf> so that's a no-go :D
[19:44:17] <TechTest> that way at least they'd know if you are capable of handling situations that happen in that job
[19:44:19] <bin> but it has no validity and no reliabilty
[19:44:30] <huf> these are people with no mouths or noses trying to figure out if you're a good chef or not :D

[19:48:15] <huf> I think they're just the same

[22:54:34] <paulo> Rashad: you should see it. it's a good movie but very upsetting
[22:54:35] <blkshp> The fastest Indian
[22:54:50] <Rashad> paulo Yeah I just read about it on Wikipedia.
[22:55:22] <Rashad> Btw maybe Wikipedia is not the best thing for this... it might contain spoilers

[22:56:16] <bin> TechTest: what?
[22:56:29] <TechTest> bin: nothing, sorry
[22:56:30] <blkshp> he meant me
[22:57:01] <TechTest> yes that's what I meant, but my keyboard is now split :D
[22:57:11] <StayHungry> Rashad: it's easier to suggest something if you provide titles you liked in the recent past
[22:57:25] <TechTest> that's probably not a very good excuse 
[22:57:40] <bin> ahh no worries
[22:57:45] <bin> I do that all the time :)
[22:58:05] <Rashad> Christopher Nolan and Tony Scott movies.
[22:58:27] <hoglahoo> bin are you any relation to binbash?
[22:58:27] <blkshp> Shutter Island.
[22:58:41] <Rashad> I saw that one too :S
[22:58:54] <blkshp> The departed.
[22:59:15] <Rashad> Haven't watched that one!
[22:59:23] <Rashad> Let me check if it is available in HDR
[22:59:28] <blkshp> It's good!
[22:59:37] <blkshp> I may watch it myself actually.
[23:01:48] <Rashad> Now to see if it is family friendly...
[23:01:54] <blkshp> It is not.
[23:02:12] <blkshp> Well, how old is the youngest of the family?
[23:02:57] <Rashad> Not so much: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0407887/parentalguide?ref_=tt_stry_pg
[23:03:08] <blkshp> Taht wasn't a requirement 
[23:03:08] <Rashad> blkshp Well... It's complicated 
[23:03:13] * Rashad is from the middle east
[23:03:24] <Rashad> So can't watch it with my mother.
[23:03:32] <Rashad> Any nudity is a taboo.
[23:03:41] <blkshp> What about shooting in the face?
[23:03:51] <hoglahoo> just ask her to go make some dinner during those scenes
[23:03:52] <Rashad> That's like comedy for us
[23:03:55] <Rashad> lol joking
[23:03:59] <blkshp> Downton Abbey!
[23:04:13] <blkshp> Though there is a gay scene so maybe not.
[23:04:14] <Rashad> shooting int he face is not desirable but is ultimately OK
[23:04:19] <Rashad> Not sure I want to watch it though
[23:05:05] <blkshp> Have you seen the shawshank redemption?
[23:05:32] <Rashad> no
[23:05:44] <Rashad> I noted the other day that it is #1 of all time on IMDB
[23:05:56] <blkshp> It's literally the best film ever. And people who know me know i don't use that word lightly.
[23:06:11] <xenial-user10> Have you seen The Titanic?
[23:06:28] <Rashad> Titanic yes
[23:07:24] <blkshp> Silly cow, plenty of room on that door.
[23:07:27] <blkshp> xD
[23:07:35] <Rashad> https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111161/parentalguide doesn't check out :(
[23:07:42] <Rashad> Maybe I'll watch stuff alone today.
[23:07:42] *** Parts: StephenS (stefika@user/stephens) (Leaving)
[23:08:00] <Rashad> My new MacBook Air has HDR \o/ so it will be like the living room TV.
[23:08:08] <Rashad> Not sure I need HDR for Shawshank anyway
[23:08:23] <xenial-user10> .w HDR

[23:08:32] <Rashad> High Dynamic Range
[23:08:49] <Rashad> Anyway this is it for me guys, gotta head home.
[23:09:02] <blkshp> I don't really remember it like that :D
[23:09:05] <Rashad> See you all.
[23:09:10] <blkshp> bye bye

[23:44:01] <twb> for some reason nobody says 'id est'
[23:45:22] <great_taste> it makes you sound like a douche trying to look smart
[23:46:19] <blkshp> i'd also say no.
[23:48:38] <great_taste> "look at me, I can speak latin!"
[23:49:16] <great_taste> I'm expecting to hear people saying "e.g." soon
[23:49:50] <blkshp> Nothing wrong with that.

[23:52:15] <hoglahoo> it's also not unusual to hear 'et cetera' and 'ex etera' here
[23:53:02] <blkshp> People would say "e.g." or "for example" they wouldn't say exempli gratia

[23:56:16] <blkshp> Latin.
[23:56:24] <blkshp> i.e. is id est
[23:56:29] <blkshp> "that is"
[23:56:40] <hoglahoo> <great_taste> "look at me, I can speak latin!"
[23:56:54] <blkshp> Liberate tu te mes, ex inferris

[23:57:37] <tinsoldier> Que?
[23:58:40] <huf> yeah it's a bit weird how english didnt translate those
[23:58:53] <huf> so it's e.g. pronounced "for example" :D
[23:58:56] <blkshp> It was incorrectly translated as "Save yourself from hell" in the movie Event Horizon
[23:59:02] <pussipupu> prestige language be prestige
[23:59:11] <huf> german managed to turn it into zB
[23:59:13] <blkshp> UTC - Universal coordinated time
[23:59:16] <huf> .hu turned it into pl
[23:59:26] <huf> pronounced pölö :D
[23:59:39] <pussipupu> Finnish uses local equivalents
