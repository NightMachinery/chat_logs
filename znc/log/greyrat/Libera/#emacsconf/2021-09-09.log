[21:45:52] <pkal> Is there a list of talks that have been submitted until now?
[21:46:16] <zaeph> pkal: Do you mean in previous editions, or for 2021?
[21:46:21] <bandali> for this year? not at the moment
[21:46:27] <bandali> how so?
[21:46:39] <pkal> 2021
[21:47:02] <bandali> i can check them though. any specific reason/questoin?
[21:47:05] <pkal> I was just wondering how many talks there will be, and what they will be about
[21:47:35] <bandali> i think last year we had about 40 talks, and you could check those
[21:48:10] <bandali> this year we've gotten about 11 submissions so far, but that's not unusual, and can dramatically go up in the last few weeks of the cfp
[21:48:12] <pkal> so there is no thread or theme to each year?
[21:48:39] <bandali> not really :) there's talks about anything and everything emacs-related
[21:48:53] <bandali> tho we have had different 'tracks'/groups of talks in previous years
[21:49:02] <bandali> e.g. org-mode-related, or config-related
[21:49:19] <bandali> are you considering submitting one?
[21:49:27] <pkal> yes, but I am unsure
[21:49:54] <pkal> I have been contributing to NonGNU ELPA over the last few months, so I thought a progress minor update to talk might be of interest
[21:50:04] <bandali> i see. understandable :)
[21:50:05] <pkal> but I'm not an actual maintainer, just a contributor
[21:50:08] <bandali> oh yeah, definitely!
[21:50:19] <bandali> i've definitely been hoping we'd get at least one talk related to nongnu elpa this year :)
[21:50:54] <pkal> I'm not sure there is a lot more to talk about than could be discussed in one talk ^^
[21:51:41] <bandali> hehe who knows :)
[21:52:26] <pkal> So it might be something that could be imagined?
[21:52:28] <bandali> i think one valuable potential talk could be about your experiences as a contributor and helping getting some packages onto nongnu elpa, what went well, what not so much, the challenges and shortcomings
[21:52:53] <bandali> things like that :)
[21:53:42] <bandali> and yeah, definitely ideas etc for the future of nongnu elpa and for improving it
[21:54:07] <pkal> Yes, that was my idea too. Ok, I'll see what can be done!
[21:54:47] <bandali> pkal, great thanks! also if you're who i'm thinking of, i'd definitely be interested in a talk about your experiences with RMAIL :)
[21:56:16] <pkal> Sadly I'm not using Rmail any more, but I've been wanting to write my own MUA eventually™, so maybe that could be worth a presentation
[21:56:46] <bandali> oh okay, cool! that'd be great too
[22:00:41] <bandali> pkal, btw, since you're here, i'd love to see more of your packages on gnu elpa or in emacs core, e.g. your autocrypt-related work
[22:02:06] <pkal> Yeah, I'd like to add autocrypt to ELPA too. I just want to find the time to implement the full specification before doing so
[22:02:26] <pkal> But thank you, your kind words mean a lot!
[22:03:05] <bandali> awesome; that makes sense
[22:03:10] <bandali> cheers :)
[22:03:48] <bandali> i was also reading your 'rearticulation' article the other day, but don't have enough thoughts about it gathered yet for a reply. perhaps if i manage to find a bit of free time :p
[22:05:18] <pkal> Oh, that would be great. I have no idea if I made much sense, so I am looking forward to ripening the ideas in future conversations
[22:06:21] <bandali> :) right. yeah i'd definitely like to think more about it all and see if i might have anything useful to add
[22:06:34] <bandali> it did make sense to me for the most part, though i don't necessarily agree with all of it
[22:08:17] <pkal> "though i don't necessarily agree with all of it" Just as intended ^^
[22:08:24] * bandali nods
