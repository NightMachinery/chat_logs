[12:09:59] <bl1nk> arm64 fails to build on my machine
[12:10:19] <bl1nk> I tried updating the docker images right after 4.3.0-pre.2 was tagged but went down the same rabbit hole and stopped :D
[12:10:55] <bookworm> in any case, if there are no prebuilt binaries the expectation is to give it libvips via other means
[12:11:01] <bookworm> meaning add it via the OS

[12:14:38] <bl1nk> node:lts-alpine uses alpine:3.11 which only has vips 8.8.4... which is too old 
[12:15:16] <bl1nk> build log says it wants 8.10 at least
[12:17:10] <bookworm> oh boy
[12:17:20] <bookworm> then compile it from source instead
[12:17:42] <bookworm> or wait, is that an ancient alpine as well?
[12:20:22] <bl1nk> Yes
[12:20:25] <bl1nk> 3.13 is current

[22:48:47] <MaxLeiter> bookworm: the comment at https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge-deb/blob/4613a6aaf8d0e2b34aef8a96dac8d180bffdde7f/tests.sh#L24-L26 explains the reasoning behind the test
[22:49:22] <MaxLeiter> "The file should have... a maximum size [that] ensures we did not load way too much third-party code"
[22:49:42] <MaxLeiter> 3 MB over the max of that test is not great 
[22:51:03] <bookworm> is sharp pushed client side?
[22:51:14] <bookworm> I thought that was a server side feature?
[22:51:42] <bookworm> and no it's not great... but you won't find a small image parsing / decoding thing either
[22:51:54] <bookworm> imagemagik isn't smaller I think
[22:52:35] <bookworm> what bugs me is that we loose the easy installation... most of our usual suspects (pi, docker people etc) won't like the c dep very much 
[22:52:41] <bookworm> at least not the official node images
[22:53:12] <bl1nk> It could be built from source
[22:53:24] <bl1nk> Tedious, but works
[22:53:26] <bookworm> sure
[22:53:44] <bookworm> but experience shows that people even mess up sqlite, and that's not a hard thing to compile
[22:53:44] <bl1nk> sharp was added to support webp, right?
[22:53:53] <bookworm> exif stripping iirc?
[22:53:55] <bookworm> not sure
[22:53:56] <bl1nk> oh

[22:55:52] <bookworm> both, supporting webp and stripping meta info from it without loosing animation
[22:57:12] <bl1nk> I wonder why the arm64 alpine build does not download the precompiled binaries. Documentation outlines that it should do so while installing
[22:57:32] <bookworm> I don't see your logs 🤷‍♂️
[22:58:20] <bookworm> keep in mind that there's also a musl requirement, maybe you missed that? Depending on your version of alpine?
[22:58:30] <bookworm> fishing in the dark, the logs should tell you more
[22:58:34] <bl1nk> Oh I don't have logs right now, that was what I saw earlier today in the Github actions build in thelounge/thelounge-docker
[22:58:48] <bookworm> that was armv7
