[00:08:42] <Hydragyrum> now it fails with an error and you need to read some man pages to find the option to make it do what you want

[00:09:27] <SysGhost> Thansk LTT
[00:09:54] <Hydragyrum> this is why I like `rm`, it doesn't do any of that bs
[00:10:17] <coder_kalyan> well IMO the question is less about prompting for confirmation and more about why the package manager got in a state of "installing steam uninstalls gnome-desktop" in the first place
[00:10:23] <teraflops> apt pining sid + experimental, apt dist upgrade, dude do as I say
[00:10:37] <coder_kalyan> which is why I've given up on apt for the past few years and been using pacman in peace :)

I am trying to set the default image viewer for webp to feh, but when I do "xdg-mime default feh.desktop image/webp" and then query with "xdg-mime query default foo.webp" I get the following "xdg-mime: mimetype 'foo.webp' is not in the form 'minor/major'" What does this mean and how do I set feh to be the default image viewer for webp?
[04:52:43] <iio7> Sorry, I queried wrong.
[04:52:46] <iio7> Doh.
[04:52:47] <nothereisnotanam> you have to query image/webp, not foo.webp

[07:41:12] <mattf> I have "Plug 'rust-lang/rust.vim'" on my init.vim but seems it doesn't matter if i comment it or not. So this already comes in the arch linux package? why and how can i "fix" this

[10:13:30] <ishitatsuyuki> is there any background on Arch defaulting to strip *all* symbols in repo packages?
[10:14:01] <ishitatsuyuki> it has a huge harm to debugging experience while the space benefits is minor compared to that
[10:16:08] *** Joins: upsala (~zcb@185.213.155.232)
[10:17:09] <BrainDamage> the reason as i understand is that there's no policy/infra to put the packaged debug symbols to
[10:17:32] <Tom^> if you ask me with todays disk sizes and even ssds becoming humongous strip could just aswell be disabled by default heh
[10:17:54] <BrainDamage> consider most packages in arch are still built or triggered to build manually ...
[10:18:26] <rookie101> \buffer 1
[10:19:34] <Tom^> BrainDamage: its embedded into the file so there shouldnt be any differences besides size
[10:20:16] <BrainDamage> Tom^: yes and no, they can be embedded or they can be external
[10:20:45] <BrainDamage> both makepkg and gdb support external symbols seamlessly
[10:20:52] <Tom^> just keep it all embedded :p
[10:21:28] <BrainDamage> in fact if you have debug and strip on, makepkg will automatically create a debug package for you

[10:24:21] <BrainDamage> if you put them in normal packages you inflate considerably mirror requirements for both storage and bw
[10:24:31] <Tom^> fair enough
[10:24:54] <BrainDamage> keeping that separated would let in principle do it electively
[10:25:24] <BrainDamage> but then you add the additional problems of having more than one class of mirrors

[13:53:29] <dtakac> Hello, I have a problem with dual-booting Windows. My Arch installation is on one NVMe SSD, and the Windows installation is on another. I followed the instructions in the GRUB Wiki to make GRUB discover the Windows OS. It does, and I am able to switch between operating systems at boot. However, before GRUB loads, there is a completely blank screen
[13:53:30] <dtakac> that stays forever until I press *any* key. When I press any key, the blank screen disappears and the GRUB menu shows up.
[13:53:35] <dtakac> Any ideas?
