[00:10:51] <SnoopJ> novapy, the tl;dr on argparse: 1) you make an ArgumentParser object 2) you call add_argument() on it 3) you call parse_args() and the argument values are in the result. But it has lots of fiddly sharp edges when you start trying to do fancier stuff.

[06:00:34] <SnoopJ> There's definitely not any direct analogy because C++ just doesn't have the same level of reflection, but subclassing an appropriate base might make it possible to do some of the same "declare a field and get other properties magically" behaviors
[06:01:25] <sidmitra> baltazar Looks like you have two different event loops(maybe you're using threads somewhere). asyncio.get_event_loop(). This method returns the event loop for the current thread. You should ensure you're passing the right event loop
[06:01:30] <SnoopJ> clarification: doesn't have the same level of reflection aside from the various evils you can do with template metaprogramming, which is basically a second programming language bolted onto class declaration.

[07:50:49] <Guest00> what about for sending confirmation emails? The problem with a github library I am looking at has a problem where users of the website could spam email sending over and over again. We need to prevent spam so that the website's sending email does not get temporarily disabled

[07:51:51] <Guest00> So as more email spams go through, the less often a user could do it? Is that logic correct?
[07:51:57] <twainwek> is there a way to get elapsed time without relying on system time consistency

[07:55:03] <SnoopJ> Guest00, yep, in that context, protection against spamming would allow some rate of sending up to the cutoff where abuse might be suspected (probably some number of emails sent in a fixed window), and from there the allowed rate of sending would be reduced
[07:56:50] <Guest00> thank you that helps a lot

I sourced it and now I get the error/warning that I don't have access to the install dir (not surprising). It tries to install stuff into the system path but I did "pip install --u -e <some git url>". Shouldn't it just install everything in my virtual env?

I just started from scratch and now it works, seems I made some mistakes the last 2-3 times. hmm, probably some depenceny issue (i.e. I probably loaded something wrong). I did what you said and that gave me a hint so thanks. :)

[20:16:38] <tempate> I'm trying to use BERT to train a classifier. The idea is to just use BERT as a vectorizer; I only have 19 samples, so I run them all through BERT and I get their vectors, which I then use as the input for the classifier.
[20:16:38] <tempate> I thought I could just use the same code I have to train the classifier when the vectors are a simple bag of words or a tf-idf (i.e. like this: https://github.com/Tempate/Prophet/blob/main/lib/feedforward/Feedforward.py#L47-L62) but when calling loss.backward() for the second epoch it gives me a Runtime Error and says I'm "trying to backward through the graph a second time."

[23:37:00] <teut> and its called manacher algorithm
[23:37:22] <han-solo> grym: ah, thanks
[23:37:32] <teut> I cant even write it when I understand the logic
[23:37:38] <teut> its pesky
[23:38:13] <bjs> teut: well it doesn't say O(n) (but it sounds possible to do in linear time)
[23:38:27] <bjs> teut: why not take your attempted solution to the island permieter one and try fix it?

[23:38:55] <bjs> teut: wasn't the problem just checking for those "boundaries" you said
[23:39:07] <teut> ya my fix was just to disallow negative indexing
[23:39:16] <teut> I can use a class
[23:39:24] <teut> class MyList:
[23:39:28] <bjs> teut: hmm, maybe you're approaching this the wrong way?
[23:39:41] <teut> what makes you think that?
[23:39:42] <bjs> Why not try fix it in a normal programming way, e.g. by checking with `if` if it's at the boundary
[23:39:48] <teut> ok
[23:39:52] <bjs> teut: well, you trying to approach it the wrong way makes me think that :P

[23:40:04] <noord> haha
[23:40:15] <teut> ya today the interview asked which is more efficient using an  if or this try except
[23:40:37] *** Joins: fikran (~fikran@user/fikran)
[23:40:44] <bjs> teut: you're trying to use fancy tricks; it's always okay to just go back to using `if` and `for`
[23:40:48] <teut> I just said random stuff, that if is efficient since its assembly instruction and that error is a python object
[23:41:16] *** Joins: inomoz (~inomoz@85.26.232.21)
[23:41:27] <teut> what would you have said?
[23:41:40] <teut> ya , fine I would do the checks
[23:41:48] <han-solo> try except, if it usually doesn;t raise any exception ?
[23:42:05] <bjs> teut: I'd ask what they meant, the question is sort of ill-posed.  And surely it'll depend how often the exception happens and what you do in each case?
[23:43:36] <teut> I didnt get a helpful response or the right answer from him
[23:43:49] <bjs> teut: maybe he didn't know either
[23:44:16] <teut> lol

[23:47:12] <bjs> teut: maybe the right answer was try/except is more efficient because most of the time exceptions dont happen (but nobody other than the interviewer knows what he was thinking)
[23:47:32] <teut> I dont know he said worked in de shaw for 2 years and asked reconsilation in react
[23:47:43] <noord> yes that is an insult

[23:48:07] <teut> oh thats a good answer bjs
[23:48:13] <bjs> teut: anyway, i recommend going back to your solution and try to fix it by just using `if` to check for the boundary rather than trying this "fancy" try/except and catching the negative indexing and all that
[23:48:21] <bjs> you are comfortable with `if`, so just use that.

[23:49:27] <teut> you have you know it already
[23:49:30] <han-solo> if i can spell, constrained right
[23:49:31] <bjs> han-solo: it depends whether they say "here you go, do this" then shut the door and leave you
[23:49:53] <teut> noord, why so?
[23:50:05] <bjs> or whether they don't really care about the solution but want to watch you work and see how you ask questions and interact
[23:50:17] <han-solo> right, i will take the latter

[23:50:51] <bjs> I still don't think it's a good technique, unless you have really no information on the person and need to start from 0
[23:50:51] <han-solo> the better one, i mean
[23:50:55] <noord> which one? js developer thing?
[23:51:11] <teut> ya , actually lot of devs do not know about that thing, since there is a jsconf talk but if was in the docs so probably knowing it might require now
[23:51:20] <bjs> teut: you have what? I'm not sure what you mean, what do we know already?

[23:55:05] <bjs> teut: how long do you think it'll take you to fix your solution and make it work?
[23:55:23] <bjs> you said the problem was at the boundary, so just make an `if` to check if you're at the boundary?
[23:55:48] <teut> no idea, can take 2 - 3 hours in worst case or even more if they are more problems that I didnt think of
[23:55:59] <teut> ok ok , doing that
