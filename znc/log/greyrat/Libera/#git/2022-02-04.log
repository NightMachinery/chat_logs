[00:37:07] <z1haze> if you had a main repo that acted as a base repo for dozens of others that you want to keep up to date with the latest code from the base, how would you do that? github only allows you to fork a repo once per org, so that doesnt seem viable. subtree kinda works, but then you are forced to put your entire project in a subdirectory and thus requires modifications to the codebase work github workflows and things like that to use the updated paths

[00:38:40] <rawtaz> z1haze: if the proper thing to do is for the base multiple times, then find a repository server that allows you to do that, would be the proper solution
[00:38:58] <rawtaz> isnt there some paid feature in github where you can do this?
[00:39:30] <z1haze> we are an enterprise level github customer, and we don't have it. you can only fork a repository once per org
[00:39:44] <rawtaz> wow, amazing :/
[00:40:00] <z1haze> i guess this is an uncommon approach, but it doesnt seem too outlandish to me
[00:40:07] <rawtaz> have you asked them about this to make sure theres really no way? i would, if you have an enterprise thing going on there, they should be happy to answer
[00:40:50] <z1haze> is my strategy very non-standard?
[00:40:51] <rawtaz> me neither. its just plain forking. i frankly dont see why github would think they have the right to care how many forks you do
[00:40:58] <rawtaz> might be some technical reason behind it
[00:41:12] <z1haze> well forking is a thing that github has, its not a git thing
[00:41:56] *** Joins: auk (auk@gateway/vpn/protonvpn/auk)
[00:42:57] <rawtaz> well isnt it the same as cloning basically? besides the reference to which is the parent and some "youre X behind" etc

[00:44:37] <z1haze> eg if the repo is in your org/user you cant fork it to the same org/user
[00:44:45] <rawtaz> given that there can be a lot of forks of a repo just in different user accounts, i dont see how they couldnt let you fork it several times
[00:44:53] <rawtaz> right
[00:45:00] <rawtaz> anyway, have you asked them about it?

[00:49:47] <z1haze> currently we use a subtree to maintain the relationship to pull in updates to core, etc, but its a big pain in the ass because subtrees have to run in a subfolder, therefore we have a repository structure where literally the entire project lives in a subfolder, which means all ci workflows and stuff like that have to be copied up to the top level directory of the repo, etc
[00:50:15] <z1haze> its just not fun. have been doing it for years now, but i just started thinking about it, and have concluded on my own that we arent really doing anything that seems that non-standard

[00:56:14] <z1haze> its packaged via a salesforce package manager, some proprietary bs, but everything needs to live in a standard directory structure, so we can't "split" pieces into different folders
[00:57:16] <ikke> Then I guess you'd need to have some script that would update all the files from the 'template'
[00:58:27] <z1haze> yeah, maybe can you poke holes in this theory? what if we just chose to forego any platform `github` specific features, like forking, and just cloned the core into its own new repo, and when it comes time to `update` the client repo with core, can't we just add a new origin, create a new branch and pull master from the core origin and then push up those changes to my client origin?

[01:00:11] <z1haze> right, we would just PR the new branch in
[01:01:38] <z1haze> what do you mean though about forgoing merge / pr's?
[01:02:05] <z1haze> i expect to still be able to PR the new client branch that i just pulled from the core origin into my client's master branch
[01:02:08] <ikke> If you don't fork the repo, but just create separate repositories, you cannot create prs between them
[01:02:18] <z1haze> yeah, well we cant do that now anyway
[01:02:28] <z1haze> nothing lost there

[11:33:31] <neure> oh, I should do git config --global core.autocrlf input # i guess
[11:33:41] <SymbioticFemale> s/customarily/customarily not/
[11:33:47] <osse> SymbioticFemale: nothing in .git cloned as such. the local git creates .git and writes data to it
[11:34:08] <SymbioticFemale> osse: alright.
[11:34:08] <osse> Very few tools use the .git/description file

[17:37:01] <vicecea> does someone happe to know what kind of locking mechanism `git` uses on a `git fetch` on Linux? - I assume if I run, say, 3 `git fetch` in parallel in the same repo, they ensure via locking that they run sequentially - thanks for any pointers

[17:40:35] <vicecea> but so it just creates a lockfile, so presumably this would work also on say an nfs mount

[17:50:41] <dminuoso> Given how poor some of the NFS implementations Ive seen, Id consider that a dangerous proposition
[17:50:58] <dminuoso> Especially since its much easier to maintain local git repositories and interchange via fetch/push/merge
[17:51:09] <dminuoso> Which fits better with how git was intenteded anyway
[17:53:37] * selckin has a 20gb git repo that takes 8 hours to clone, so you know sometimes nfs starts to make sense

One is MacOSX( git version 2.35.1) and the other Ubuntu(git version 2.25.1). I can clone just fine. Then on each one when I cd to cloned folder I do "git status". I get "Refresh index" message followed with "Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'". So far so good

[22:49:52] <DoofusCanadensis> Linux has a case-sensitive file system by default. macOS doesn't. check to see if those files are committed with two cases
[22:50:02] <OnlineCop> Guma: I once saw something like this when my Mac's filesystem was case-sensitive.
[22:55:21] *** Joins: emf (~emf@162.218.217.190)
[22:55:41] <Guma> OnlineCop that could be it. This is my new machine and I thing default Mac fs is case-sensitive
[22:56:07] <Guma> So is reinstall only fix?
[22:56:52] <OnlineCop> If you look at the original repo, does it show two files with the same name, but different cases?
[22:57:35] <Guma> But when I do diff on on of the files it clearly shows differences
[22:58:10] <Guma> I can check. But if it would be difference cases then it would show as files delete and some new files untracked. Is my assumption correct?
[22:58:26] <Guma> And I only see "modified:"

[23:00:42] <OnlineCop> I think my fix had been to `git mv file.ext file1.ext; git mv FiLe.ExT file2.ext` and then decide which of the two should actually keep the original filename, and which one should be renamed.
[23:01:27] <OnlineCop> Then `git mv` the one you want to keep back to `file.ext` so it no longer shows the changes.
[23:01:56] <OnlineCop> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8904327/case-sensitivity-in-git also suggests `git config core.ignorecase false` to help with some of the naming issues.
[23:02:21] <Guma> I just checked on both systems I cloned. And the file name is the same. But file sizes are different. Both are on (master)
[23:03:18] <Guma> I will try adding "core.ignorecase false" to .gitconfig. Do I have to do fresh clone again?

[23:25:46] <DoofusCanadensis> the accepted answer points to file system case sensitivity
[23:26:20] <DoofusCanadensis> Linux has case-sensitive file systems by default. All other commonly used OS do not (i.e. macOS and Windows)
[23:26:27] <matthugh> hi all :)
[23:29:12] <Guma> So I did a quick test and created two files in my ~/ on my Mac: Test1.txt and test1.txt. I got two files
[23:29:37] <Guma> So I think it is not it. Unless I am missing something
[23:30:43] <OnlineCop> Guma: Another suggestion on that page is that there's a `.gitattributes` file which contains `* text=auto` and one or more of the files uploaded to the repo have different line endings than what it expected.
[23:31:36] <Guma> I did checked. I do not have `~\.gitattributes` not one exists in root of cloned repo :(

[23:34:46] <DoofusCanadensis> the important point is what is in the repository
[23:35:11] <DoofusCanadensis> if the file you have marked as modified exists in the repo with more than one case, Git may mess up
[23:35:17] <DoofusCanadensis> regardless of what local tests you did

[23:37:36] <Guma> DoofusCanadensis Ok but my understanding (and correct me if I am wrong), If I would have case sensitive fs issue, content of files would not matter. Just file names. So at checkout some tiles names would be wrong. So if I would do `git status` I would see for example File1.txt untracked and file1.txt deleted. Is my assumption correct?

[23:38:32] <DoofusCanadensis> no that assumption is not correct
[23:39:00] <DoofusCanadensis> if you have file1.txt and File1.txt, Git on macOS *might* checkout the first one and then checkout the second one over top the first
[23:39:27] <DoofusCanadensis> so the first thing you do is check the git repo for the existence of multi case files before deciding your OS is fine
[23:39:40] <Guma> Ahh. Tx. Let me see if I can somehow convert to worse case reinstall/reformat OS
[23:40:06] <DoofusCanadensis> just look for the dang files
[23:40:14] <DoofusCanadensis> it's probably Git at fault here

[23:56:20] <matthugh> would anyone know how best to configure a bash alias for git so that completion plays nicely? Specfically, the complettion involves setting --git-dir but many completions don't appear to work unless I'm in that directory
