[01:15:58] <InPhase> Izem: Plugin or standalone?  The only one I'm using is google-no-tracking-url, which I've had for a long while.  But I see there's a ClearURLs plugin now which appears more general with a lot more rules.

[01:16:19] <Izem> plugin
[01:16:33] <Izem> clearurls sends the urls somewhere else idk why
[01:16:57] <Izem> there's like a few extra requests just to do a query
[01:17:13] <InPhase> Oh, well that gets in the way of not tracking...
[01:17:43] <Izem> only noticed cause I was fooling around with dns entries on my computer
[01:17:53] <InPhase> The primary reason I wanted it for google though is performance.  I hit google links a LOT, and very rapidly.  I don't need the redirect delay.
[01:18:24] <InPhase> But thanks for the tip on that.  I will not switch to ClearURLs then.  :)
[01:18:25] <Izem> yes, also not having long links is better to check history, sharing etc
[01:18:30] <Izem> np
[01:18:44] <Izem> I thought making a standalone one would be a good idea
[01:19:11] <Izem> extra step to get to the search bar but it's not bad I guess
[01:19:26] <Izem> I already use chrome in incognito for the most part
[01:19:45] <InPhase> Hmm.  ClearURLs specifically says they do not collect any usage data.  If you can prove they are lying that should probably be reported.
[01:20:23] <Izem> I don't know how it works but I will be sure to verify again later
[01:20:43] <PamiPetteri> what is the best object oriented programming language for general purpose computing systems?
[01:20:44] <Izem> not the most confident in my knowledge
[01:21:03] <Izem> PamiPetteri your favourite
[01:21:27] <Izem> unless you have some other metrics
[01:22:04] <InPhase> Ok.  It looks like ClearURLs is written by a CS student in Germany.  So maybe you could also just attempt to contact him about it.  He seems to be a real person unlikely to be engaged in any sort of intentional fraud.  :)
[01:22:19] <PamiPetteri> Izem: I prefer C++ because it is a hybrid language. I like the modularity. I tried Java but disliked it. Have not tried many OOP languages. I think Java has too much overhead
[01:22:38] <Izem> sure thing, I also need to figure out a domain name today

[01:23:05] <Izem> but it's mostly because of git :P
[01:23:21] *** Joins: src (~src@user/src)
[01:23:32] <Izem> PamiPetteri sadly that is just an incorrect bias
[01:23:45] <Izem> plus they are **really** similar
[01:24:02] <Izem> it's ok to dislike it though
[01:24:23] <Izem> does anyone actually like programming in Java?
[01:24:26] <InPhase> PamiPetteri: C++ remains a top choice for either large scale applications or performance-critical code.  It is not the cleanest language, and it is fairly complicated to learn, but it gathers together most of the most useful features, and combines that with a rich set of native libraries.
[01:25:14] <InPhase> PamiPetteri: All that is required to get good code in C++, after going through the learning effort, is to exercise discipline in using a good subset of features.
[01:25:21] <Izem> I would say C++ is actually made to be used in some areas where Java is horrible
[01:25:56] <Izem> e.g. want to write a unix daemon, networking, etc etc
[01:26:17] <phogg> It's not like Java is bad at those things
[01:26:19] <InPhase> Java only even works conveniently for certain structures of code.  Then you attempt other types of problems and Java has you tripping over your own feet.
[01:26:24] <Izem> otherwise I'd choose Java
[01:26:29] <Izem> phogg it is
[01:26:41] <Izem> though they have recently updated the networking iirc
[01:27:08] <Izem> otherwise I'd choose Java over C++*
[01:28:03] <Izem> I also think competing with C++ is pretty dangerous, but ah well :P
[01:28:07] <phogg> There are lots of things I dislike about Java, but the biggest is the culture and how it informs API design.

[01:30:08] <jtgd> "a good subset of features" IOW C.
[01:30:13] <InPhase> I do a lot of numerical programming, so I have a simple rule:  If you can't overload operators and give native behavior to new types, you're out of the competition.
[01:30:17] <phogg> I like to immerse myself in a language where the culture of the others using it, and thus the people designing the libraries I might need to use, is compatible with my own.

[01:31:37] <phogg> Izem: DNS notation is backwards, so of course reverse is preferred

[04:39:06] <PamiPetteri> Doc007: we had Turbo Pascal 7.0 and Borland C 3.1. We had to remember that in the "real mode" RAM space was inside 1MB, that was the 16 bit mode, the default mode for MS-DOS.
[04:39:34] <vdamewood> Doc007: Oh, heres the *really* fun part. DOS itself ran in 16-bit mode, so you had to switch memory modes/architecctures MANUALLY.
[04:39:49] <vdamewood> Even if you had a nice, juicy 32-bit 386.
[04:40:05] <Doc007> lol

[04:41:28] <PamiPetteri> the segment was 64k, and there were 10 segments to be used, total of 640k
[04:41:51] <vdamewood> Well, you could set the segment to any 16-bit value.
[04:42:15] <vdamewood> But each segment overlapped the next by all byt 4 bytes.
[04:42:28] <PamiPetteri> .COM files used only 64k, .EXE files could be larger but had to fit in the 640k memory, and there were Terminate Stay Resident programs in memory usually, that were put there by AUTOEXEC.BAT and even CONFIG.SYS

[04:44:45] <vdamewood> Granted, in those days, fitting a program in 640k wasn't too difficult since the main removable storage medium at the time could only handle 1440k.

But I won't be asking random people how to *actually* do the breakin on IRC without first ensuring people it's a CTF from the get-go, and even then, the CTF will be, most likely, merely identifying the potential flaws, not actually carrying out the attack.
[06:24:45] <arahael> Even then, you can't do CTF's without being absolutely and legally certain that it's indeed a CTF, as you have to assume that the other person is lying.

[08:17:48] <arahael> vdamewood: I initially did it in kivy, but had to drop that and ported the UI to an embedded chromium directly.
[08:17:59] <arahael> vdamewood: You'll never guess why I had to do that.
[08:18:02] <beaky> embedded chromium nice
[08:18:27] <vdamewood> Embedded chromium... aka, not quite electron.
[08:18:36] <arahael> Not quite electron, indeed.
[08:18:40] <beaky> maybe i should port my tea database to electron so that i can experience modern cross platform development
[08:18:54] <vdamewood> arahael: Licensing?
[08:19:27] <arahael> vdamewood: One person made the *observation* that the Kivy version didn't work if started via Windows 7 Remote Desktop, as that has an OpenGL version of 1.1 and Kivy at the time required 2.0
[08:20:11] <vdamewood> I'm so glad I don't support Windows 7 anymore.
[08:21:14] <arahael> beaky: These days, I think for a fully custom UI, I'd probably just lean towards SDL.
[08:22:14] <arahael> vdamewood: Companies, I think, don't realise just how destructive it is to a project to not allow the developer to design the product appropriately and to make those decisions.  Otherwise, we end up having to make the appropriate decision for each small feature.
[08:23:00] <arahael> vdamewood: And in aggregate, the decisions aren't great.  Eg, I had *multiple* chromiums embedded.
[08:23:08] <arahael> Because those features were worked on and implemented independently.
[08:23:40] <arahael> Using the best, most logical, implementation for each feature, individually.
[08:25:17] * vdamewood hugs Qt
[08:26:42] <arahael> vdamewood: I wasn't allowed to use that.  $6k licensing cost multiplied by however many developers were in the dept who could potentially have worked on it
[08:27:13] <arahael> vdamewood: The sales person I had asked for a quote must have assumed we'd haggle.  We don't haggle.
[08:27:38] <vdamewood> arahael: Well, Qt's LGPL which is fine for most of my uses.
[08:27:50] <vdamewood> Alas, only *most* of my uses.
[08:27:54] <arahael> Right.
[08:28:09] <arahael> LGPL's a bit tricky for certain large companies.
[08:28:26] <vdamewood> How so?
[08:28:28] <khanred> aka prohibitive 
[08:29:44] <vdamewood> Still how so?
[08:30:25] <vdamewood> Give credit, build with DLLs, allow debugging replaced libs.
[08:30:46] <vdamewood> I could see the corperate types not understanding the debugging replaced libs part.

[08:36:22] <arahael> jeaye: I don't believe in american-style high-pressure startups.
[08:36:24] <jeaye> arahael: It's jut about bindgen. Qt has its own syntax, so it's not just C++. It's C++ compiled by MOC to handle the signals/slots
[08:37:04] <arahael> jeaye: Ah, yeah, I'd probably go via an intermediary language - eg, node, python, etc, whichever has exceptional Qt bindings.
[08:37:18] <vdamewood> Well, moc doesn't really compile the source. It just generates glue code based on the contents of the header.

[08:39:36] <arahael> Gamah: The trouble with the bindings... If you're doing them in the project, then everyone on the project typiaclly has to be good at both languages.

[08:40:21] <Gamah> jeaye: well see.... python lends itself to being lazy
[08:40:22] <arahael> Gamah: If cython isn't much faster, then the language isn't the problem. You need to profile and optimise.

[08:44:10] <arahael> (Perhaps you should be)
[08:44:18] <Gamah> not very parallelizable...

[08:46:10] <arahael> Gamah: Even without paralizing, numpy offers many *highly* efficient data structures and computation libraries.
[08:46:10] <jeaye> "billions" is typically a good point to start thinking about GPUs.

[08:49:10] <Gamah> completely
[08:49:23] <jeaye> If so, within Python you can memoize all of those decisions, since you're going to be doing a lot of duplicate work otherwise.
[08:49:28] <Gamah> not using numpy... haven't looked into it... it's pretty simple tho...
[08:49:39] <vdamewood> Well, damn. I decided to see what 'slots' actually expands to, and my build isn't letting me.
[08:49:48] <arahael> vdamewood: Hmm. :)
[08:49:49] <Gamah> jeaye: yeah there could be a little optimization in making the decisions a hash table instead of actual code...

[08:50:24] <arahael> gtg, laters.
[08:50:25] <vdamewood> arahael: It's because the header I included is including QtCore/something.h and I don't remember the flag to add a framework to my include search.
[08:50:27] <jeaye> That's a huge optimization. Simple memoization can turn an exponential alg into a linear one.

[09:24:26] <vdamewood> Yeah, indeed. That's partially because C++ implementations aren't very stable in their abi implementations.
[09:24:39] <arahael> Though, curiously, looks like Rust's bindgen supports some subset of C++.  Impressive.
[09:26:38] <vdamewood> But there are also features C++ has that other languages don't support.
[09:26:39] <vdamewood> This reminds me. I need to figure out if python has a way to store a C pointer (even a void pointer) in a Python object.
[09:27:17] <arahael> vdamewood: It does.
[09:27:29] <vdamewood> for JNI there isn't directly, but you can use a Java long in many systems.

[16:09:15] <victor> Hey! Requesting some feedback on a design :) I want to build an application that shows two options to two different users, and when you guess the right answer, you'll be scored depending on how quick you answer. First idea was just to measure the time in the frontend from options presented until user clicked and send that over to the backend, but that's easy for the user to cheat around. Second idea was to measure the time in the backend instead, 
[16:09:15] <victor> but then latency might ruin the timing. Last idea I had was to before presenting the options, do some quick syncing between client<>server to see what the latency is like, and then measure on the backend, but that's vulnerable to latency jitters/inconsistent latencies instead. Anyone have any other ideas that might work for this? 
[16:11:50] <[itchyjunk]> Doesn't the solution depend on how precisely you're trying to measure?
[16:12:17] <[itchyjunk]> if extreme precision is needed, you will impliment if client side and add some security measure
[16:13:03] <victor> [itchyjunk]: yeah, probably. The measure doesn't have to be super precise, around 100ms is fine
[16:13:28] <victor> yeah, client side was my first idea as well. What security measures can you think of to put in place? 
[16:13:38] <[itchyjunk]> How would they cheat?
[16:14:30] <victor> well, if the measurements happen client-side, then when submitting the answer to the backend there would be a field called "duration" or similar, the user could set this value themselves before sending the response

[16:17:23] <victor> [itchyjunk]: doesn't matter what language, asking about the design of it :) 
[16:17:27] <[itchyjunk]> you can encode it something to get around that?
[16:17:50] <[itchyjunk]> victor, then why would a user be able to modify it?
[16:17:54] <[itchyjunk]> hash it or something
[16:17:54] <victor> well, if the client can encode it, then it could also decode > fudge numbers > encode
[16:18:01] <victor> same problem with the encoding
[16:18:03] <[itchyjunk]> no
[16:18:13] <victor> users have full control of the client, hence the name user agent :) 
[16:18:17] <[itchyjunk]> if being able to encode implied being able to decode
[16:18:28] <[itchyjunk]> i could read other people mails based on their public eys
[16:18:30] <victor> too easy to write a browser extension that captures the submit requests and overwrites the values
[16:18:37] <[itchyjunk]> ...
[16:18:45] <victor> [itchyjunk]: eh what? Not sure I understand what you mean
[16:19:04] <[itchyjunk]> Encryption and decryption are two different functions
[16:19:14] <[itchyjunk]> client doesn't need to have decryption function
[16:19:24] <victor> or, if browser extensions are too wild for you, a hostile user could write a API client with the same logic
[16:19:25] <[itchyjunk]> even if it did, use wouldn't have access to it
[16:19:29] <jinsun> just punish the people with poor internet connection, and go with simple timing in the backend
[16:19:31] <victor> ah, encryption is different than encoding though :) 
[16:19:45] <victor> jinsun: hah, yeah, that's one option for sure :) 
[16:20:09] <[itchyjunk]> you still encode to encrypt
[16:20:14] <[itchyjunk]> encoding and decoding happens.
[16:20:32] <victor> anywho, even if the value is encrypted in the client-side, since the encryption key would still exist client-side it'd be trivial to override the value still. Won't actually solve anything but maybe turn off the most novice scriptkiddies but not more than that

[16:28:54] <Guest87> How do i determine whether to use AWS or something like Linode for a web application?
[16:29:32] <victor> pyzozord: thanks! :) Unfortunatly not as Overwatch is a real time FPS as well, deals with different issues than what I'm trying to do
[16:29:37] <beaky> nice i like overwatch
[16:30:09] <victor> Guest87: unless you have a very good reason to use AWS, avoid it like the plague as you are paying premium prices for something you can find basically anywhere
[16:31:18] <Guest87> victor: does it make sense to choose if i want scalability or plan on using several other aws services along with it?
[16:31:41] <[itchyjunk]> PC games and console games use quite a bit of different stratigy
[16:31:44] <arahael> AWS does let you scale up and down very very easily though, if you have experience with AWS, it's worth using - but only if you already have experience with it.  Otherwise I'd probably go with something somewhat more...  Classic.
[16:32:12] <[itchyjunk]> for consoles, it's very hard to introduce any new code since it checks the file structure during load each time
[16:32:37] <victor> Guest87: most of the popular hosts will handle scalability as well as AWS. Scalability depends more on the architecture you build rather than the architecture of the host you're using. If you're using some service that only exists at AWS, then yeah maybe. But you'll pay the price for everything to just use that service. You could also host something somewhere else and still just use that AWS service, no need to host everything with AWS
[16:33:10] <[itchyjunk]> since you only need assymetric security (data going from client -> server) assymetric crypto would work for you

[16:33:53] <arahael> victor: Yeah, well, cloudfront is really hard to beat.
[16:33:58] <victor> [itchyjunk]: so, if we're thinking about the attack vector where the client instead of sending the measurements the frontend did, sends a measurement that the user itself wrote, how does that prevent this vector?
[16:34:12] <[itchyjunk]> you generate a pair of values, one linked to the event of "clicking" and send that seprately

[16:34:43] <victor> arahael: eh, not really, there is tons of CDNs out there, many with faster response times than CloudFront. I'd only use AWS if there is some service that only exists with AWS
[16:34:44] <[itchyjunk]> the user would not know how to encode the data into the right format

[16:35:33] <Guest87> Admittedly i don't have much experience with it, but as long as it's relatively easy to set up billing limits i don't mind
[16:35:59] <victor> [itchyjunk]: I think we're talking past each other or something. If the browser agent knows how to encode a value, then the user could themselves easily figure out how to encode that value in the same way too, so it doesn't actually solve the vector
[16:36:18] <Guest87> I guess a question i have is why do so many large startups (pinterest, twitch, etc) use AWS over linode/digital ocean/etc?
[16:36:29] <[itchyjunk]> victor, server waits for 2 tokens.
[16:36:43] <[itchyjunk]> an event trigger and a data packet to go with it.
[16:37:17] <[itchyjunk]> a server uses the difference between the two.
[16:37:56] <[itchyjunk]> the type of user you're thinking about who can go around this would be working at machine level
[16:38:02] <arahael> Guest87: AWS is *huge*, and you can account for every tiny thing, and if you need really specialised services, you can get that too.

[16:38:10] <[itchyjunk]> these type of mythical cheaters are sometimes discussed in game cheating

[16:38:25] <victor> [itchyjunk]: right, and these two tokens are generated where? 
[16:38:47] <Guest87> arahael: so if i plan on needing to scale quite a lot, and to use quite a few aws services, does it then make sense to pick it over other hosts?
[16:38:48] <victor> no, the user I'm thinking about is literally any user who can also program JS. It'll be trivial to cheat
[16:38:48] <[itchyjunk]> being generated client side doesn't means they can regenerate exact tokens
[16:39:09] <[itchyjunk]> you're saying the user is going to null route the tokens generated by client
[16:39:14] <[itchyjunk]> then generate identical tokens
[16:39:17] <[itchyjunk]> and send this to your server.

[16:39:56] <arahael> Guest87: Hmm, honestly, probably not.  You can scale up heaps on most services I suspect, just not /quite/ at the scale AWS can but you're not likely to hit that and you can transition (at a cost) anyway.

[16:40:47] <victor> encryption is irrelevant :) It's also already encrypted at the transport level so whatever. Won't prevent users from modifying in-flight requests
[16:40:48] <arahael> Guest87: As an example of the degree of scale where you might well be required to use AWS, would be something like a country's census.

[16:43:00] <[itchyjunk]> You said this is application independent.
[16:43:06] <[itchyjunk]> there are language dependent issues.
[16:43:09] <[itchyjunk]> is this js?
[16:43:14] <arahael> [itchyjunk]: It is application independent.  You could do this using mitmproxy, as an example.
[16:43:47] <[itchyjunk]> arahael, if a client already sends tokens to a server, the server sees that. then again one that the user forged.
[16:43:58] <victor> [itchyjunk]: it does not matter. I'm talking about overall application architecture, how the requests reaching the server are being made doesn't really matter to what I'm trying to solve here...

[16:54:41] <victor> mercenary: most likely irrelevant as the transport I'm planning to use abstracts that away (WebSockets)

[18:45:33] <pulse> as a game dev, i can tell you TDD is about as useless as a rubber chicken in a ping pong match
[18:45:34] <PlanckWalk> No, some functions are utterly trivial.
[18:46:11] <Intelo> pulse and what about just tests. (post dev)
[18:46:13] <pulse> TDD works if you're implementing some well defined behavior like maybe some kind of a technical spec

[18:46:28] <pulse> Intelo, tests are good

[18:48:15] <PlanckWalk> Also language makes quite a difference.  I test weakly or dynamically typed languages a lot more stringently.
[18:48:16] <Intelo> PlanckWalk so a project with Tests will take double time?
[18:48:26] <PlanckWalk> Not usually, no
[18:48:31] <Intelo> PlanckWalk and TDD might take 2.25 times
[18:48:33] <Intelo> PlanckWalk then?
[18:48:43] <PlanckWalk> I don't know how long TDD will take, I never use it
[18:49:02] <PlanckWalk> (and never been anywhere that required it)
[18:49:08] <PlanckWalk> (Or really, allowed it)
[18:50:52] <PlanckWalk> Testing from the start has maybe added 20-50% in raw coding time.  Hard to say how much it has saved though.

[18:56:14] <Amadiro> both testing and proofs come in a bunch of varieties too, some more accessible than others
[18:56:28] <mrig> A curious though, I just realised how difficult it is to depict a decent sun, you cant blend into blue sky easily at all, as the slightest mix of yellow and blue, buts a green tinge into the colour blend.
[18:56:34] <beaky> yes test-driven design assumes that design should be driven by tests and assumes that such a design necessarily leads to a good design but in fact tests are neither sufficient nor necessary for a good software design neither do they necessarily lead you to one that satisfies requirements dictated by a software specification (the ultimate norm for good design) since (1) test-driven design
[18:56:35] <mrig> thought
[18:56:36] <beaky> refines the spec into (initially failing) unit tests, and an implementation is 'good design' and satisfies the spec only insofar as it passes those tests, but it's not at all clear why failing tests drive design into an implementation, and (2) it assumes the domain decomposes completely into unit tests that are as small as possible, but in fact often it is the integration that is usually
[18:56:36] <Amadiro> like fuzzing, invariant testing/property based testing, which is quite different from unit testing or even integration testing
[18:56:38] <beaky> important and unit tests dont compose by themselves into an integration test (for that you need a design to integrate in the first place, and test-driven design doesnt drive towards that)
[18:56:42] <Amadiro> and a type system is also a form of proof
[18:56:43] <pyzozord> it won't stop if from mistunderstanding your problems (proofs won't either) but it will help you make sure you write what you intended
[18:56:50] <PlanckWalk> As far as I can see, the main benefit is from having any sort of automated testing in your build process vs none.
[18:57:13] <PlanckWalk> Then adding new tests is trivial and useful.
[18:57:25] <mrig> far easier to do by rendering than by hand in 2d.
[18:58:09] <pyzozord> mrig: I guess it might be worth doing some investigation into color theory (I bet there is one) and into the mechanics of how human eye works and also how humans preceive light
[18:58:09] <PlanckWalk> mrig: Ah yes, subtractive vs additive colour.
[18:58:25] <pyzozord> mrig: although that might be a serious overkill for what you need

[19:43:38] <quartz> mrig: Yes but if the span of dates overlaps between two different years? Like december 10 2020 to march 2 2021
[19:44:23] <quartz> euouae: the first date will always occur before the second, if that's what you're getting at.
[19:44:42] <euouae> quartz no I'm just explaining to you that you should do it more algorithmically instead of by numerical calculations
[19:45:22] <quartz> euouae: I'm not sure I follow what you're saying?
[19:45:22] <euouae> Have a function no_days(first, second) reduce to the cases: first is a year before second OR first and second in same year.
[19:45:44] <quartz> SO this is basically a dynamic programming type problem
[19:45:53] <euouae> for the first case, add: no_days(first, Dec 31) + no_days(1 Jan, second) 
[19:46:26] <euouae> for the second, 365 - (no_days(first, Dec 31) + no_days(1 Jan, second))

[19:49:41] <mrig> arguably the love of complexity required to love rust would result in more complex software.
[19:50:18] <PlanckWalk> To do it correctly as written, you need to call DaysInMonth for every month in the interval

[19:52:47] <euouae> quartz it's a question of approach. You're thinking of a math formula that solves the problem in a single equation
[19:52:59] <euouae> quartz I'm thinking of a stupid computer that loops over all months/etc and adds up days
[19:53:15] <pyzozord> beaky: only one i know: the halting problem
[19:53:23] <quartz> PlanckWalk: But how will I know how long I should iterate for? I first calculated the number of months and used that number in a for loop that would loop until it reached the total number of months
[19:53:23] <beaky> yes just toss a neural network at the problem and have it deep learn the calendar
[19:53:28] <euouae> some reductions, such as the year assumption I mentioned, allow you to get away with O(1) instead of O(n) so it's fine.
[19:53:35] <pyzozord> but I'm not sure if that qualifies as a paradox
[19:53:37] <menace> programming paradox: what unittests the unittesting framework?
[19:53:44] <beaky> lol
[19:53:58] <mrig> That the more apt the programmer is at holding complex things in their mind, without a sense of aesthetics they are prone to writing code that is not maintainable.
[19:54:00] <PlanckWalk> quartz: Until you reach the month containing the end date
[19:54:17] <euouae> mrig the only code that is not maintainable is the undocumented code 
[19:54:34] <euouae> everything else is fine, no matter how convoluted or insane
[19:54:38] <mrig> So the best coders can make the most mess, it is quite a paradox.
[19:55:16] <quartz> PlanckWalk: Yes, but what about the case of December to March?
[19:55:28] <quartz> I need some kinda formula to calculate the total months, yes?

[19:56:23] <pyzozord> It requires more attention so I can more conciously direct my attention
[19:56:24] <PlanckWalk> Since they're represented by numbers, you can just increment and wrap.
[19:56:26] <mrig> euouae: so you dont think that code layout and structure have an effect on readability then?
[19:56:35] <pyzozord> beaky: I've set my computer to now show any color at all

[20:26:03] <PlanckWalk> It has a function that gives the number of days for a year,month pair.

[20:27:18] <[itchyjunk]> sounds like he's stuck figuring out how many months are between februray to january
[20:27:32] <[itchyjunk]> since substraction operator would return 1 when he wants 11
[20:27:34] <[itchyjunk]> not sure though
[20:28:18] <PlanckWalk> Basically just keep incrementing a month at a time until you hit the ending month.
[20:28:32] <[itchyjunk]> thats how i was thinking but in a bit more complicated way
[20:28:36] <PlanckWalk> (Which you can check with  end_year == year && end_month == month)
[20:29:09] <[itchyjunk]> so while current year != end year, increment current month mod 12 by +1 each time till eyou hit end munch
[20:29:10] <[itchyjunk]> oh
[20:29:27] <[itchyjunk]> sounds similar to what i was thinking then minus the mod
[20:29:29] <[itchyjunk]> hmmmmm

[23:01:42] <Amadiro> yep, and most displays can only cover a fairly small portion of all the colors (or color-space) that we can perceive
[23:02:23] <pyzozord> I think the short summary is that RGB is color model can index 16m colors, sRGB is a color space that translates color model to a really narrow range of wavelengths. ACES is the modern cinematic standard, alternative color space to sRGB, that has a much higher and finer resolution of wavelengths and amplitude (actual light intensity) however it must be fed something else than RGB, something that

[23:07:07] <Amadiro> many TVs do more than just 8 bit color resolution these days and HDR
[23:07:39] <Amadiro> my relatively normal 4k tv has it and has a far wider gamut than sRGB

[23:09:28] <pyzozord> If I'm not mistaken HDR is much better than no HDR. Not just because of it shines in your face but becauses it alows the rgb channels focus on the hue, so if the content is authored correctly you'll have less color clamping

[23:10:39] <Amadiro> yeah, it'd be nice if the end-user could control the HDR operator applied at the end a bit better and reduce the range

[23:11:31] <pyzozord> I'm also not a big fan of the loudness creep over the years. I have a compresson turned on system-wide.

[23:12:02] <pyzozord> I like resolution of signals, I don't really like extreme values in light or sound.
[23:13:12] <pyzozord> But that greyscale thing on my laptop is interesting I'll need to spend more time with it. My hipthesis is that it allows me to control my attention better
