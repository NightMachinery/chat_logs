[19:08:20] <Bayes> Could use a second opinion here, I'm trying to make my statement as clear as possible
[19:09:22] <fendur> o/
[19:09:34] <Bayes> If you have a quantity v s.t. v1 < v2 is preferred. Would you say that *lower* is better or *smaller* is better? Vice versa, would you say that *higher* or  *larger* is better?
[19:10:04] * Bayes overthinking life since 1701
[19:10:19] <fendur> lol. I think it would depends on what the quantity represents. 
[19:10:29] <Bayes> I understand that, but more generally
[19:10:47] <Bayes> say it's not a quantity you can relate to a physical quantity where lower, smaller, or shorter may make more sense
[19:10:53] <fendur> I'm thinking from the perspective that I often do stats then present that information to policy makers who don't know/care about the details. So I just want to say it best in THEIR terms in context.
[19:11:13] <Bayes> (e.g., lower level of contamination is better)
[19:11:16] <Bayes> think of an index basically
[19:11:49] <fendur> I can't seem to abstract myself there. 
[19:11:54] <Bayes> heh ok
[19:11:58] <Bayes> RMSE?
[19:12:17] <fendur> "larger error" sounds better than "higher error"
[19:12:37] <Bayes> yeah I guess that makes sense in this specific case
[19:12:44] <Bayes> too context sensitive :P
[19:12:48] <fendur> :)
[19:13:04] <Bayes> a lower ratio, tho?
[19:13:17] <Bayes> and lower/higher density
[19:14:05] <fendur> yeah those work. and notice you're using the context of what "density" and "ratios" mean or how they are typically used in speech. You can't remove the context.
[19:14:27] <Bayes> funny cause RMSE is a 1D quantity while MSE is a 2D quantity, so physically I'd say a short RMSE but small MSE
[19:14:28] <fendur> or at least, i'd argue you shouldn't bother trying
[19:14:35] <Bayes> xD
[19:14:41] <Bayes> don't bother = a lesson for life
[19:15:01] <Bayes> ok thanks for your thoughts on this
[19:15:12] <fendur> no problem. hope it helped and will understand if it doesn't :)
[19:15:24] <Bayes> no, it definitively does
[19:15:53] <Bayes> there are like so many small decisions that it's nice to have a second opinion on
[19:16:01] <Bayes> like a desk mate
[19:16:31] <fendur> yeah i wish i had more of that during my grad work
[19:16:46] <Bayes> like, I have 8 independent values which I'm summarizing with the mean and the standard error for the mean. And now I can't decide whether I want to report a (student-t?) interval or not
[19:17:22] <fendur> i mean, that's what peers are for. do what seems reasonable and like enough, and if someone disagrees, they'll tell you when you present it.
[19:17:34] <fendur> if you spend too much time debating yourself, you'll be inefficient
[19:18:05] <fendur> consider those alternatives, and you'll be ready to make a comment when someone asks. that's enough usually.
[19:18:33] <Bayes> what? are you saying that you needed more than meeting with your adviser 1 hour per week and having them share with you whatever they could think top off their head and only remembering like 50% of the details of your work? :P
[19:18:43] <fendur> to be fair, our work contexts are different :)
[19:19:06] <fendur> yes. present your work as much as you can
[19:19:14] <Bayes> agreed
[19:19:28] <Bayes> presenting work is a pain in the neck but it helps a lot
[19:19:35] <fendur> yes
[19:19:42] <Bayes> it's like... doing exercise... which of course I don't
[19:20:11] <fendur> i think you'll find if you build presentation into your work flow, it becomes easier from an effort and an emotional standpoint
[19:20:53] <Bayes> true that, and it does help
[19:21:26] <Bayes> it's always good to have your presentation material from the last time you presented to be, like, no more than a month or two old
[19:21:59] <Bayes> anyway I'll duck back and try to power thru this
[19:22:13] <fendur> good luck!

[23:01:05] <Bayes> what's a nice and neat way to do something like a `base::table`-like 2D table with mean values instead of counts?
[23:02:48] <h_m> aggregate? tapply? ...
[23:02:56] <fendur> not sure about "nice", but aggregate will get you the data, then some form of table[ edgelist-style-fill-matrix ] <- the values from that matrix
[23:03:20] <fendur> that's not clear at all
[23:03:31] <Bayes> that's what I was going for
[23:04:00] <Bayes> either casting a DF with the means in wide format, and then adding the margins by hand
[23:04:41] <Bayes> or using table(factor1, factor2) <- as.vector(matrix_with_means)
[23:05:52] <Bayes> h_m !!!!
[23:06:00] <Bayes> ?aggregate has an example
[23:06:17] <Bayes> xtabs(value ~ ., aggregate(value ~ factor1, factor2, DF, mean))
[23:06:19] <Bayes> and book
[23:06:22] <Bayes> boom*
[23:07:23] <fendur> oh cool!
[23:07:41] <Bayes> even better
[23:07:55] <Bayes> addmargins(xtabs(value ~ ., aggregate(value ~ factor1, factor2, DF, mean)), FUN = mean)
[23:08:12] <fendur> how wonderful. what's addmargins from?
[23:08:21] <Bayes> stats
[23:08:25] <fendur> no shit.
[23:08:28] <fendur> cool
[23:08:32] <Bayes> R has like some very obscure functions
[23:08:38] <fendur> that was an "ill be darned" kind of "no shit"
[23:08:55] <Bayes> like I just got to xtabs by chance looking at ?aggregate thanks for h_m 's comment
[23:09:00] <Bayes> and then xtabs to addmargins
[23:09:01] <Bayes> xD
