[00:19:26] <hackers> hi
[00:25:54] <rawtaz> lo
[00:26:00] <rawtaz> why is your nick in plural?
[00:26:14] <rawtaz> not even borg has their name in plural
[00:26:45] <hackers> because your nick is singular
[00:27:31] <rawtaz> but it doesnt make sense
[00:27:48] <hackers> I have a docker-related question
[00:28:06] <hackers> when I do a multi-stage build and COPY --from=builder /files /to-my-server-build , the files are owned by root, even if I do it after a "USER <someuser> statement
[00:28:26] <hackers> then if I want the user to own the files, I have to chown all the files and it takes a hell of a long time
[00:28:32] <hackers> is there a way out of this?
[00:28:46] <rawtaz> USER only defines which user the process should run as, i dont think it affects the copying. is the source /files owned by root too?
[00:29:05] <rawtaz> are*
[00:29:19] <hackers> yeah they are but in the builder stage so I was thinking then if another stage COPY these files, maybe they don't know the user of the first stage
[00:29:38] <hackers> but you are right about USER not affecting copying
[00:29:57] <DoofusCanadensis> maybe do the build step as the same USER
[00:29:59] <rawtaz> right. i dont really know for sure but i'd expect and think it makes sense that the files are copied as they are, just liek you'd do a regular cp in whatever system - it copies the ownership along with the files
[00:30:05] <hackers> DoofusCanadensis: how?
[00:30:06] *** Joins: archpc (~archpc@user/archpc)
[00:30:20] <DoofusCanadensis> switching to USER when you build?
[00:30:35] <hackers> whaaat?
[00:30:50] <hackers> like RUN ["su - user"] ?
[00:30:51] <rawtaz> yeah add a USER to the build stage part, so the building produces files owned by the proper user
[00:30:58] <hackers> ah to the builder!
[00:31:03] <hackers> sorry I'm simple
[00:31:04] <hackers> haha
[00:31:12] <hackers> ok let's try it out...
[00:31:35] <rawtaz> DoofusCanadensis: but why would that have an effect on those files during the build?
[00:31:52] <rawtaz> i mean, doesnt USER just affect what the ENTRYPOINT runs as, and not what is done before that
[00:33:10] <hackers> cd /tmp
[00:33:11] <DoofusCanadensis> because everything you run after the USER step is run as that user
[00:33:57] <DoofusCanadensis> I've used that in some of my Dockerfiles... initial setup, USER imacooluser, do some more things, USER root, finish up
[00:34:02] <rawtaz> right, you mean there's a difference in that USER affects the user that the RUN commands "use", but it doesnt affect what a COPY does
[00:34:48] <DoofusCanadensis> honestly, USER should affect COPY unless it doesn't copy like we think it does
[00:35:17] <rawtaz> im not sure i see why COPY would change ownership of files it copy
[00:35:33] <hackers> https://gist.github.com/ncouture-invue/82f123fcf5f86d43937b83bdd3e9d0a7
[00:35:37] <hackers> I tested this and it doesn't work
[00:35:56] <hackers> (used these images because I already had them downloaded locally)
[00:36:53] <DoofusCanadensis> hmm, what user are the files set to in each case?
[00:36:57] <hackers> root
[00:37:28] <DoofusCanadensis> alright, how about a different tack... why do you need your files installed as a USER?
[00:38:11] <rawtaz> hackers: but arent the files you copy in line 5 owned by root already? if you add e.g.  RUN chown -R luser foobar  as line 6, doesnt it "work" then?
[00:38:35] <rawtaz> (just as a test, not saying you are going to chown, but trying to establish if it's a matter of the original files ownership)

[00:39:04] <DoofusCanadensis> move is supposed to keep the original owner, copy is supposed to use the owner of the directory and/or the account doing the copying
[00:39:14] <hackers> yeah chown will work, I don't want to have to chown
[00:39:24] <hackers> I want the files COPY'd
[00:39:29] <hackers> to be owned by `luser`
[00:40:15] <rawtaz> well, it's pretty simply. whatever you do, a COPY does not change ownership (the same as in any other `cp` on a regular system, so this is pretty expected)
[00:40:24] <DoofusCanadensis> I have an app here that has opted to write its configuration files right next to the application in /bin... except as !root, it's not allowed to write there
[00:40:27] <hackers> apparently COPY supports --chown
[00:40:31] <hackers> let's see if it's slow
[00:40:36] <rawtaz> oh nice
[00:40:41] <DoofusCanadensis> oh cool
[00:41:18] <DoofusCanadensis> typically, having the files owned by root "shouldn't" be an issue 
[00:41:26] <DoofusCanadensis> the application should still be runnable by luser
[00:41:37] <rawtaz> yeah hackers is definitely doing it wrong. pity.
[00:42:18] <DoofusCanadensis> I wouldn't necessarily say it's wrong
[00:42:31] <DoofusCanadensis> but then I know none of the details on why this is
[00:42:37] <rawtaz> im just being provocative :P
[00:42:55] <DoofusCanadensis> yup
[00:43:16] <hackers> yeah now that you mention this I completely forgot why I'm doing it

[00:43:57] <DoofusCanadensis> yes
[00:44:06] <hackers> format my luser
[00:44:07] <rawtaz> i never used that
[00:44:14] <DoofusCanadensis> been there, done that
[00:44:55] <DoofusCanadensis> heck, I'm at a point right. now were a prior decision should never have been made now that I'm dealing with the after effects of it
[00:45:10] <rawtaz> oh really? sounds like every day of my worklife :P
[00:45:15] <DoofusCanadensis> oh shit, *this* was why I wasn't allowed to make *that* change

[00:46:50] <hackers> I actually interrupted the build at 400
[00:47:10] <DoofusCanadensis> so it's an even better improvement
[00:47:19] <DoofusCanadensis> good job on improving that step
[00:49:16] <hackers> :thumbs-up:
[00:49:32] <rawtaz> :upptumme: as we say here in sweden
[00:50:29] <hackers> wow "The Swedish constitution allows anyone to ski, cycle, skate, swim or camp almost anywhere in the country.
[00:50:32] <hackers> is this true?
[00:50:38] <DoofusCanadensis> üëç
[00:51:57] <rawtaz> hackers: yeah you are probably referring to what's called the "Allemansr√§tt", translates into "Every man's right". as long as it's not a private property like the back of someone's house, so you dont disturb anyone, youre free to stay there as long as you behave and do it properly
[00:52:40] <rawtaz> i think some places such as nature reserved areas might be an exception, due to wildlife etc. but theres not much of the areas covered by such zones
[00:53:30] <hackers> this is awesome
[00:54:08] <hackers> here in Quebec Canada the government owns >90% of the land as well but we're not allowed to camp just anywhere we want
[00:54:18] <hackers> can you build on public land in Sweden?
[00:54:28] <rawtaz> which country are you in?
[00:54:33] <hackers> Quebec, Canada
[00:54:35] <rawtaz> sorry lagging here
[00:54:52] <rawtaz> nah you have to own or have an agreement to build stuff

[00:55:19] <rawtaz> so like, if you were to go out into the woods or whatever that no private person or company owns, can you not camp there? where can you camp?
[00:58:59] <hackers> private ZEC (controlled exploitatation zones) or public national parks
[00:59:34] <hackers> you can hunt and to different activities on public land but not camp
[01:00:30] <hackers> though every year the government has lottery where they give away for purchase or lease, small portions of public land where you can build but they must be used as secondary residence (for vacation only) ...
[01:00:46] <rawtaz> hm interesting rules..
[01:01:01] <rawtaz> any idea why they dont allow people to camp anywhere they dont disturb anyone or anything?
[01:01:13] <hackers> I should bring my starlink antenna to Sweden and camp / work from camp for a complete summer :)
[01:01:36] <hackers> it's law just like you can't sleep in a public park
[01:01:58] <hackers> it's probably tolerated by most but they can definitely prevent you from camping if they decide to
[01:03:57] <rawtaz> yeah but im talking about out in the woods where noone else is. i fail to see why gov wouldnt let you camp there
[01:04:14] <rawtaz> its like, what useful purpose would that have, preventing people from enjoying nature which just makes them feel good

[02:13:32] <L0j1k> people abuse allemansr√§tten tho, my last wife's family has some islands in ostergotland and people are super shitty, they will land and camp and start fires on the rocks, breaking the rocks, they'll walk all over the area basically just trespassing and leaving fence gates open, trampling across the h√∂ and destroying it, and even some people like will bring a huge team of immigrants to pick all the

And I _seem_ to be able to access the containers from the host with netcat. But can't create DB connections, which are based on IP address and port number I believe
[04:26:06] <Sqaure> What is your take on Nix? On the fly composable containers that doesnt require you to build images? 
[04:26:10] <nickspoon> `docker ports Oracle` still looks correct with the expected ports mapped

[04:26:43] <nickspoon> I think
[04:28:06] <rawtaz> Sqaure: thats not what Nix is afaik
[04:28:10] <rawtaz> but Nix == great
[04:28:36] <rawtaz> nickspoon: again, you need to establish the actual symptoms..
[04:29:04] <nickspoon> Well that's what I'm trying to drill into but I can't work out where to go next
[04:29:19] <rawtaz> nickspoon: what are you seeing instead of what oyu expect to see when you try to connect
[04:30:28] <nickspoon> I see oracle TNS errors, e.g ORA-12547: TNS:lost contact
[04:30:34] <rawtaz> surely you are getting some kind of error message etc
[04:30:53] <rawtaz> what is it that oyu have connecting to that database anyway? some separate host than the docker host?
[04:31:26] <nickspoon> I have lots of client applications connecting to the database
[04:31:37] <nickspoon> I'm not sure what you mean by a separate host
[04:31:40] <rawtaz> ok. so it's with one of those that you can reproduce the problem, for example?
[04:31:46] <nickspoon> All of them
[04:31:56] <nickspoon> the simplest is sqlplus on the command line
[04:31:57] <rawtaz> you have your docker host where the containers run. im asking if you can reproduce it on a separate host than that system
[04:32:10] <nickspoon> This is all on my local machine
[04:32:22] <rawtaz> simply because if you run it on another host then you remove a few potential things/mistakes that could be done if you instead debug this on the host :)
[04:32:55] <nickspoon> I haven't had this setup on another host, I am not sure how to move it
[04:33:05] *** Joins: kostkon (~kostkon@2a02:587:a116:e46c:7814:108:8592:7c58)
[04:33:14] <rawtaz> am i being unclear?
[04:33:25] <rawtaz> you have computer one, which is the server where you run the database container, right?
[04:33:30] <rawtaz> lets call it the "server"
[04:33:34] <nickspoon> It's all computer 1
[04:33:59] <rawtaz> so you do not have clients using that database on *other* computers than that first server/computer 1 ?
[04:34:23] <nickspoon> Some of the clients are running from a VM but otherwise, no
[04:34:32] <rawtaz> ok
[04:35:25] <nickspoon> The error I get from a SqlServer connection from a .NET app is: System.Data.SqlClient.SqlException: A network-related or instance-specific error occurred while establishing a connection to SQL Server. The server was not found or was not accessible. Verify that the instance name is correct and that SQL Server is configured to allow remote connections. (provider: TCP Provider, error: 0 - The wait
[04:35:28] <nickspoon> operation timed out.)
[04:35:49] <rawtaz> i see, thats what i was talking about. that's the symptom of your problem
[04:35:53] <nickspoon> So again it looks like a network issue of sorts ... but in my local network
[04:36:06] <nickspoon> rather, not local network but local machine
[04:36:11] <rawtaz> what is it connecting to? a port on your host? how did you run the db container (the full docker command)?
[04:37:27] <nickspoon> docker run -d -it --name Oracle -p 1521:1521 -p 5500:5500 -v /data/data/backups:/ORA_BACKUPS store/oracle/database-enterprise:12.2.0.1
[04:37:51] <nickspoon> (that was run like a year ago when I set it up)
[04:39:53] <rawtaz> ok nice
[04:39:59] <rawtaz> and what does `docker ps` show now?
[04:40:49] <nickspoon> http://ix.io/3G7Z  <- output of `docker ps` and `docker port` for both containers
[04:41:10] <rawtaz> thanks
[04:41:21] *** Joins: m1n10n (~r41d1n@cpe-76-184-204-251.tx.res.rr.com)
[04:42:28] <rawtaz> what does your client connect to, i mean which ip/hostname and port?
[04:43:31] <nickspoon> with sqlserver it connects (from the host machine) to localhost:1401 and from a vm it connects to the host machine IP address and the same port
[04:43:55] <nickspoon> With Oracle it uses 0.0.0.0 and port 1521
[04:44:23] <nickspoon> Oracle is a bit tricky though and uses a tnsnames.ora file to configure the connection
[04:44:38] <rawtaz> i see. so all that makes sense :)
[04:45:23] <rawtaz> so if on your host you telnet or nc to 127.0.0.1:1401 what do you get? does it connect? do you get any output and what if you type something do you get a response?
[04:45:28] <nickspoon> http://ix.io/3G83 <- tnsnames.ora
[04:45:54] <rawtaz> ha! thats almost like a lisp thinkg
[04:45:56] <rawtaz> -k
[04:47:26] <nickspoon> http://ix.io/3G84  <- nc outputs (including invalid port 11111 for comparison)
[04:48:34] <nickspoon> And after stopping the containers, I get "Connection refused" on both ports
[04:48:39] <rawtaz> but can you skip the -z so you instead get a connection where you can type?
[04:48:48] <rawtaz> like if you were to just telnet to it
[04:49:06] <rawtaz> i'd be curious if you get some output from the db server at all :)
[04:49:15] <nickspoon> OK, you'll need to tell me the commands, I don't know netcat or telnet well
[04:49:27] <nickspoon> I do get an interactive prompt, yes
[04:49:37] <rawtaz> if you have telnet just try `telnet 127.0.0.1 1401` and if you get something like being connected try typing something
[04:50:05] <nickspoon> I don't, I'll just work out where to install it on arch
[04:50:18] <rawtaz> oh thats fine, you can use nc the same way
[04:50:24] <rawtaz> just replace telnet with nc
[04:51:25] <nickspoon> I get a prompt but no response when I type
[04:51:40] <nickspoon> from either netcat or telnet
[04:51:51] <rawtaz> does telnet say youre connected?
[04:51:55] <nickspoon> yes
[04:52:11] <nickspoon> Trying 127.0.0.1...  Connected to 127.0.0.1.
[04:52:24] <rawtaz> i guess you are then. i dont know if you should get a response, some server software dont reply until they see a valid request, so thats uncertain
[04:52:59] <rawtaz> that that means we can't be sure that we are actually reaching something that is working. however we should be fairly okay to assume that we are reaching a software in the container that is accepting the connection
[04:53:07] <rawtaz> have you tried simply restarting the container?
[04:53:21] <nickspoon> yes. And restarting docker. And restarting the host
[04:53:21] <rawtaz> im pondering the possibility that the server software in it isnt behaving
[04:53:25] <rawtaz> ok
[04:53:37] <nickspoon> Right but it's 2 different containers too
[04:53:49] <rawtaz> yeah thats a good point indeed
[04:54:04] <rawtaz> what's your output from `docker network ls`
[04:54:37] <nickspoon> http://ix.io/3G87
[04:55:01] <nickspoon> This is where I wonder if I have deleted something
[04:55:25] <nickspoon> Unfortunately I don't know how this output looked yesterday
[04:55:32] <rawtaz> have you run any fishy commands in relation to when it stopped working?
[04:55:43] <nickspoon> Yes
[04:55:49] <nickspoon> docker network prune
[04:55:57] <nickspoon> Which is my best guess
[04:56:54] <nickspoon> I also edited /etc/docker/daemon.json and added a "bip" entry that I didn't understand to try something out, but then removed it again (and have restarted everything since)
[04:58:40] <rawtaz> any firewall changes?
[04:58:45] <rawtaz> system updates?
[04:58:53] <rawtaz> we must be missing something super simple lol
[04:58:56] <nickspoon> Hmm. 
[05:00:30] <nickspoon> I did `iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT` at one point
[05:00:37] <rawtaz> can you try this:  docker run --rm -it -p 1088:80 traefik/whoami
[05:01:24] <rawtaz> and then in another terminal see if you can connect to it by e.g. `curl 127.0.0.1:1088`
[05:01:40] <rawtaz> that little image is just a simple web server that says hello, useful for debugging purposes
[05:02:05] <rawtaz> the point is to see if you have the same problem of not being able to reach a completely simple and new container
[05:02:19] <nickspoon> I ran it, but curl isn't reaching it I don't think
[05:02:42] <rawtaz> you can also try to nc or telnet to 127.0.0.1 port 1088 if you want, with telnet you'd just connect and if it connects you run  GET / HTTP/1.0
[05:02:48] <rawtaz> really? what does it say?
[05:03:11] * rawtaz wonders where all the smart people are when they're needed in here :P
[05:03:27] <nickspoon> Oh man you're helping so much, I really really appreciate this
[05:03:35] <rawtaz> sure
[05:03:41] <nickspoon> curl just sits there, presumably it would time out after a while
[05:03:46] <rawtaz> it's just 2:30 AM and i have a ton of work, so meh
[05:03:49] <rawtaz> hmm ok
[05:03:50] <rawtaz> thats fishy
[05:04:06] <nickspoon> telnet 127.0.0.1 1088  says it connects
[05:04:09] <rawtaz> can you verify it by `docker ps` and just pasting the line for whoami here?
[05:04:23] <nickspoon> But after entering  `GET / HTTP/1.0`  I don't get any response
[05:04:29] <rawtaz> hm ok
[05:04:35] <rawtaz> thats the same symptom as for your other container(s)..
[05:04:46] <rawtaz> hm hm hm
[05:05:11] <nickspoon> 281f69f2c9fd   traefik/whoami                              "/whoami"                3 minutes ago   Up 3 minutes              0.0.0.0:1088->80/tcp, :::1088->80/tcp                                                  reverent_agnesi
[05:05:29] <rawtaz> theory: could it be a matter of you having added an accepting forward rule to your firewall, whereby the traffic is accepted but *state is not kept for the accepted connection*, causing return packets to not come back through?
[05:05:44] <nickspoon> And in the container where I started it it's still sitting there with the message "Starting up on port 80", nothing else
[05:05:47] <rawtaz> im not sure how that would be in line with you getting a "connected" status but well. just a long shot.
[05:05:53] <rawtaz> hmm ok
[05:06:29] <nickspoon> I really don't know about the firewall thing, I foolishly was entering commands that a colleague was giving me to try something out, without knowing much else about it
[05:08:02] <nickspoon> Do you know much about iptables? Will it mean anything if I paste my /etc/iptables/iptables.rules ?
[05:08:25] <nickspoon> http://ix.io/6b4  <- iptables.rules
[05:08:40] <nickspoon> I don't know if I can just remove that forward line...
[05:12:15] <rawtaz> can you paste the output of `iptables -L`? probably similar
[05:14:48] *** Quits: pycurious (~Adium@user/pycurious) (Quit: Leaving.)
[05:14:52] <rawtaz> ok so i verified that the whoami image only outputs "Starting up on port 80" and then it should be serving a webpage with some info - i tried it
[05:15:51] <rawtaz> do you have port 80 listening or bound on your host already? otherwise can you cancel the previous docker run for the whois and run  `docker run --rm -it -p 80:80 traefik/whoami`  and then using your browser go to http://127.0.0.1  and see what you get?
[05:15:52] <nickspoon> Well, I've now done _something_ messy to my iptables, I can't run the whoami container currently
[05:16:04] <nickspoon> http://ix.io/3G89  <- that's my current iptables -L output
[05:16:14] <nickspoon> No I don't have anything listening on 80
[05:16:42] <nickspoon> Oh yes I did!
[05:16:50] <nickspoon> I had nginx running, I didn't realise
[05:17:22] <rawtaz> is it something you can shut down temporarily just so we can use port 80?
[05:17:32] <nickspoon> Yeah I've stopped it
[05:18:06] <rawtaz> ok then please try what i wrote above. and also please paste output of `cat /proc/net/ip_tables_names`
[05:18:49] <rawtaz> which channel have i seen you in before?
[05:19:01] <nickspoon> Probably #vim ?
[05:19:07] <rawtaz> oh maybe
[05:19:09] <rawtaz> and perhaps this one
[05:19:25] <nickspoon> No I've never been here before, this is all forbidden territory :D
[05:20:01] <rawtaz> ok
[05:20:04] <rawtaz> odd
[05:20:32] <nickspoon> I don't get anything in the browser at 127.0.0.1
[05:20:36] <nickspoon> connection refused
[05:20:48] <nickspoon> oh 
[05:20:52] <nickspoon> sorry I didn't read properly
[05:21:02] <nickspoon> I'll run the whoami container on 80:80
[05:21:27] <rawtaz> yeah use the command i gave you
[05:21:33] <wez> nickspoon: why are you running on a priviledged port for?
[05:21:45] <rawtaz> wez: we're just debugging, it's temporary
[05:22:05] <nickspoon> which port are we talking about? 80?
[05:22:51] <nickspoon> I don't get a connect refused in the browser. I just don't get a response. It'll time out eventually I expect
[05:23:28] <rawtaz> please paste output of `cat /proc/net/ip_tables_names`
[05:24:11] <nickspoon> It's empty
[05:24:18] <wez> rawtaz: OK
[05:24:47] <rawtaz> nickspoon: what does /etc/os-release contain?
[05:26:24] <nickspoon> http://ix.io/3G8b
[05:28:36] <rawtaz> if you run `nft` or `nftables` you get only that the command wasnt found, i guess?
[05:29:21] <nickspoon> Right
[05:30:06] <rawtaz> well im truly puzzled. as far as i can tell you have a wide open firewall that will let anything through from anywhere to anywhere. so that shouldnt be the isue unless im missing something.
[05:30:23] *** Quits: vlm (~vlm@user/vlm) (Quit: "")
[05:30:24] <rawtaz> you can reproduce the problem with the simplest test possible, a whoami container running on port 80
[05:31:01] <rawtaz> for kicks, please cancel the whoami docker run command and run the one that you tried the first time, the one with port 1088 instead, then try your browser with  http://127.0.0.1:1088
[05:31:36] <rawtaz> for further kicks, try also https://<theLAN-IPofYourHost>:1088 to see if you get any other result than the eventual timeout there
[05:31:49] <rawtaz> im starting to wonder if there's a routing issue..
[05:32:17] <rawtaz> when network connections time out it's not rare that there's routing issues. especially when there's no firewall issue.
[05:33:32] <nickspoon> Alright well I really appreciate your help, thanks. I'm trying the for-kicks suggestions without luck so far
[05:33:43] <rawtaz> are the symptoms the same, timing out?
[05:33:52] <nickspoon> Yeah
[05:34:14] <nickspoon> So if I stop the whoami container the pending request fails immediately
[05:34:17] <rawtaz> can you `docker exec <thenameofthewhoamicontainer> bash` and get a shell there? if yes, can you ping 8.8.8.8?

[05:42:46] <rawtaz> that makes sense in a sense
[05:43:01] <nickspoon> I have wget 
[05:43:25] <rawtaz> please pastebin `ipconfig -a` and `netstat -nr`

[05:46:07] <nickspoon> ip a   ^^

[06:08:41] <rawtaz> nickspoon: here's what i get when i run the exact same wget command: https://kopy.io/SKXbq
[06:08:52] <rawtaz> there is something broken with the network in your docker.
[06:09:03] <rawtaz> traffic isnt going out nor in. its just blocked for some reason
[06:09:15] <rawtaz> have you configured your system to use 192.x for the docker networks?
[06:09:23] <rawtaz> can you share your docker configuration?
[06:09:54] <rawtaz> hackers: isnt there some termpaste or whatever else similar to ix?
[06:10:10] <nickspoon> I haven't configured it on purpose
[06:10:17] <nickspoon> Which config are you interested in?
[06:10:27] <nickspoon> I have /etc/docker/daemon.json
[06:10:31] <rawtaz> the one for your docker daemon. yeah that i think
[06:10:32] <nickspoon> which only has 2 lines
[06:10:53] <nickspoon> { "data-root": "/data/docker/", "storage-driver": "overlay2" }
[06:11:00] <hackers> rawtaz: idk what termpaste is but ix.io is very... primitive
[06:11:14] <rawtaz> nickspoon: ok
[06:12:23] <nickspoon> So my local network is split over both 192.168.1.* and 192.168.2.*
[06:12:31] <rawtaz> yeah
[06:12:53] <rawtaz> im not seeing anything wrong with that or the ip info you haev showed, so im puzzled
[06:13:07] <nickspoon> I *did* add a "bip" entry to /etc/docker/daemon.json, and then removed it. I wouldn't think adding then removing that would trigger some setting being cached somewhere else?
[06:13:36] <nickspoon> The only other config I'm aware of is the systemd service file
[06:13:40] <rawtaz> i do wonder, is there anything *in* the container that you need to keep or can you recreate the container? at least for one of them you used bind mount so the data isnt in them i suppose (unless it writes to some other data path than what you bind mounted)
[06:13:58] <rawtaz> please pastebin that system one if you can, why not
[06:14:29] <nickspoon> The stuff in the databases is very important and I'm not as confident as I'd like to be that I have it properly backed up
[06:15:13] <hackers> yo.. I wouldn't want to live anywhere near container that can't be re-created...
[06:15:22] <rawtaz> actually it's not that relevant.. since you can reproduce the problem with completely new containers. so never mind that

[06:19:52] <nickspoon> 4pm for me
[06:20:02] <rawtaz> you could easily build one actualy, its just a simple docker file
[06:20:11] <rawtaz> let me paste one real quick, before we quit for today
[06:20:18] <nickspoon> OK

[06:25:21] <nickspoon> apt can't resolve the repos

[06:25:33] <rawtaz> in your host, can you ping 8.8.8.8 ?
[06:25:44] <nickspoon> yes
[06:25:45] <rawtaz> i mean outside of docker, just in a terminal on your host
[06:25:51] <nickspoon> yeah
[06:25:52] <rawtaz> hmm
[06:26:03] <rawtaz> ok you mean that the build also doesnt work because of the network issues.
[06:26:12] <rawtaz> i guess that makes sense, didnt think about that
[06:26:12] <nickspoon> right
[06:26:43] <rawtaz> a workaround would be to use an image on hub.docker.com that has the tools

[06:27:06] <rawtaz> but well, it's just to verify that the symptoms are no network working, in a container that has the proper tools for it.
[06:27:50] <rawtaz> i dont have better ideas than to try and isolate and for every step verify things. thats the usual way i debug things. it's a matter of that and the verification of things along the way is a requirement
[06:28:24] <rawtaz> i really have no idea why your docker isnt able to communicate network wise. i never saw this before. it's quite interesting

[06:29:18] <rawtaz> hm i wonder..
[06:29:38] <rawtaz> what os is your host?
[06:29:43] <nickspoon> arch linux
[06:30:00] <rawtaz> oh sorry
[06:31:03] <rawtaz> can you just try to stop the firewall temporarily to see if that helps?  systemctl stop iptables.service
[06:31:33] <rawtaz> and then try the ping in the container again (which image did you use anyway?)

[06:34:14] <rawtaz> is that the IP that the network-tools contianer got?
[06:34:29] <rawtaz> or what does `ifconfig -a` in that container say?
[06:34:30] <nickspoon> It's the IP of my router
[06:34:55] <nickspoon> http://ix.io/3G8u
[06:35:05] <nickspoon> ifconfig -a  ^^
[06:35:11] <rawtaz> oook ay thats interesting.
[06:35:50] <rawtaz> which of your regular containers was it that had `ip a` in it and you pasted http://ix.io/3G8h for?
[06:36:08] <nickspoon> Hmm. SqlServer I think
[06:36:34] <nickspoon> no Oracle
[06:37:06] <rawtaz> that Oracle contianer has 192.168.1.1. the network-tools container accoridng to http://ix.io/3G8u has 192.168.1.1. you say that your router (i presume you mean another device than your computer) has 192.168.1.1. is this all correct?
[06:37:21] <rawtaz> unless im missing something here, that seems terribly wrong.
[06:37:26] <nickspoon> Oh it's different not
[06:37:30] <nickspoon> http://ix.io/3G8w
[06:37:33] <nickspoon> *now
[06:38:45] <nickspoon> I'm directly connected to a switch (192.168.2.1) which is connected to the main router (192.168.1.1)
[06:40:38] <rawtaz> do you mean like  [docker host with LAN ip 192.168.2.122] -- [switch with 192.168.2.1  towards docker host and 192.168.1.x towards router] -- [router with 192.168.1.1 towards switch] ?
[06:40:40] <nickspoon> I'm thinking I should try to configure a bip in daemon.json again

[06:45:17] <rawtaz> well to the LEFT of what chain i wrote, in/on the docker host, you have contianers with IPs 192.168.1.x. so e.g. one of them sends a packet to 8.8.8.8 from its 192.168.1.1 IP (or .2, doesnt matter), this is put in your docker host's LAN network which routes it through 192.168.2.1 (the switch) which routes it through 192.168.1.1 (the router - if this even happens since the packet is *coming from* that same 192.168.1.x address so the packet might be considered ro
[06:46:05] *** Joins: withered_wolf (~withered_@174.25.131.17)
[06:46:11] <nickspoon> But then ... how did it work yesterday?
[06:46:59] <rawtaz> then, either the router sees this packet and things "wtf, a packet from 192.168.1.1 which is the address i have?? doesnt make sense, ill ignore this". OR it thinks "uhm, ok, i'll forward this onto the internet, fine." and does so. but even then the reply coming back would be desinted for 192.168.1.1 or .2 and it wouldnt make sense for the router to *route* that through the switch - it would at best put it on the local network between the router and the switch.
[06:47:41] <rawtaz> one guess would be that you then had a firewall rule that NATed traffic from the 192.168.1.x containers network such that traffic from containers when seen by the switch appeared to come from the docker hosts's 192.168.2.122 IP.
[06:47:47] <rawtaz> that would probably make it all work.
[06:47:58] <rawtaz> but all of this is just my guessing. i could be missing something. but i think it might be right.
[06:48:19] <rawtaz> i dont see how your current setup, if it is what i wrote above, wouldnt collide (without NAT at least)
[06:48:27] <rawtaz> (NAT / masquerading)
[06:49:18] <nickspoon> This all sounds quite feasible. Although I don't see how I changed it in the last 24 hours
[06:49:34] <nickspoon> unless that iptables forwarding rule clobbered something

[06:51:02] <rawtaz> i guess you ran more commands than just that `iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT` one?
[06:53:04] <rawtaz> here's what i have for `iptables -L`: https://kopy.io/zLOBX - looking at your http://ix.io/3G89 i was wondering about your missing DOCKER stuff, but i figured that since all your tables just say "accept everything" then that would be fine
[06:55:06] <nickspoon> I don't think there were many more network commands ... I checked the status of ipv4 forwarding with   `sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding`
[06:55:20] <nickspoon> Today I've tried toggling that on and off
[06:56:13] <rawtaz> ok
[06:56:32] <rawtaz> lets see

[06:57:52] <nickspoon> http://ix.io/7nN
[06:59:09] <rawtaz> which interface does your docker host use to go out on the internet? enp0s31f6 or wlan0 ?
[06:59:17] <rawtaz> i think it's wlan0 first, right?
[06:59:41] <nickspoon> I'm not sure

[07:06:57] <nickspoon> http://ix.io/3G8B
[07:08:03] <rawtaz> uh what is this.. these DOCKER related ones were not here when we looked at this output the previous time
[07:08:16] <nickspoon> I do not know
[07:08:52] <nickspoon> I have restarted iptables and docker ... did one add something to the other?
[07:08:58] <nickspoon> omg this is confusing
[07:10:01] <rawtaz> well docker is expected to modify iptables rules. so your last paste looks more correct than the previous one at http://ix.io/3G89 and http://ix.io/7nN
[07:10:11] <nickspoon> OK
[07:10:37] <rawtaz> however oyou now have masquerading rule active afaict. the traffic should be masqueraded
[07:11:02] <rawtaz> and you still cant ping? can you build the container like before?
[07:11:55] <nickspoon> No can't ping. And I can't build the dockerfile you provided either
[07:11:59] <rawtaz> ok
[07:12:13] <rawtaz> i find that odd. because i really thought that we were onto something here
[07:13:12] <rawtaz> hm do you have an ethernet cable connected now? you *could* try pulling it out to make sure that the machine is really using the wlan0 interface, and test again
[07:13:31] <nickspoon> I CAN ping the whoami container now!
[07:14:04] <rawtaz> please clarfiy what you mean, what command/action is now possible?
[07:14:05] <nickspoon> It is providing some html referencing "login.html:
[07:14:14] <nickspoon> not ping. Sorry. curl
[07:14:17] <rawtaz> hm ok
[07:14:19] <nickspoon> curl 127.0.0.1
[07:14:33] <nickspoon> when whoami is run with 80:80
[07:14:55] <rawtaz> oh wait. have you enabled iptables again (you stopped it earlier)?
[07:15:02] <nickspoon> oh
[07:15:09] <nickspoon> I have enable iptables again yes
[07:15:12] <rawtaz> ok
[07:15:25] <nickspoon> And that response I'm getting from the whoami table is from my 192.168.1.1 router...
[07:15:32] <rawtaz> can yo show it?
[07:15:44] <nickspoon> But I don't get it when I stop the whoami container
[07:15:52] <nickspoon> So this sounds like exactly what you've been describing
[07:15:59] <rawtaz> wait im not following
[07:16:11] <rawtaz> are you running curl 127.0.0.1 on the docker host?
[07:16:29] <nickspoon> yes
[07:16:47] <rawtaz> if yes, please pastebin what you get as output.
[07:16:50] <nickspoon> http://ix.io/3G8D  < with docker run --rm -it -p 80:80 --name whoami traefik/whoami
[07:17:06] <nickspoon> That HTML is coming from my 192.168.1.1 router
[07:17:14] <rawtaz> THAT is very fishy
[07:17:23] <rawtaz> veery fishy
[07:17:24] <nickspoon> If I hit http://localhost in my browser I get the router admin login
[07:17:44] <nickspoon> And when I stop the whoami container, I don't get anything from localhost anymore
[07:17:55] <rawtaz> ok
[07:18:31] <nickspoon> So. If I set a bip for the docker daemon to tell it to use a specific range of ip addresses, will that help?
[07:18:59] <rawtaz> if i were you in your shoes now, i would pause right there. because this has lots of info in it and it means something is very odd, and that you wnat to figure out what. i mean, it makes zero sense that you end up at your routers web UI when you access localhost:80 which should go to your whoami docker container
[07:20:18] <rawtaz> uhm well in a way but at the same time not
[07:20:48] <nickspoon> Yeah I need to sleep on this
[07:20:54] <nickspoon> And you definitely need to sleep
[07:21:18] <rawtaz> we can conclude that your network configuration right now is fscked up in one way or the other
[07:21:29] <nickspoon> yes
[07:21:38] <rawtaz> there are ways to debug this more and also more proper configuration of your docker i think
[07:21:46] <rawtaz> but its too much to sum up right now, yes
[07:21:56] <nickspoon> I have some network admin mates. I'll get some advice on simplifying the network
[07:22:17] <hackers> you're sharing your router's ip address
[07:22:18] <rawtaz> ideally you should be using docker in regular mode, not bridged, with your containers being orchestrated using e.g. docker-compose
[07:22:21] <rawtaz> that would simplity it
[07:22:31] <hackers> two hosts with same ip 192.168.1.1
[07:22:38] <nickspoon> yeah
[07:22:59] <nickspoon> how am I configuring docker to run in bridged mode?
[07:23:01] <hackers> good stuff (if you want to do arp spoof)
[07:23:02] <rawtaz> the containers would then be using internal networks instead of bridged ones, so you wouldnt have these collisions
[07:23:20] <hackers> it may be the default?
[07:23:40] <nickspoon> OK
[07:23:44] <rawtaz> im surprised that the containers are using bridged mode, i never got that by default :o
[07:24:08] <hackers> then ignore what I said it's not based on anything
[07:24:23] <rawtaz> nickspoon: it might be that when you access localhost the whoami is somehow redirecting to the IP it has, which is 192.168.1.1 and you then end up on the router. its probably something simple like that. thats easy to investigate as well
[07:24:55] <hackers> guys you spend 3+ hours on this, can't you try to reproduce the issue with the simplest Dockerfile, docker-compose or whatever is implicated in this issue and take it from there?
[07:25:28] <rawtaz> hackers: i cant reproduce this. his setup is whats broken. i dont have a broken setup :)
[07:25:38] <nickspoon> OK. It looks like this is the crux of it now. So I can look into this later with these specific things to look into
[07:25:47] <rawtaz> yeah its been a long time, but at least we found the culpruit
[07:25:50] <rawtaz> yeah
[07:25:58] <hackers> what is his setup is what I'm asking
[07:26:02] <nickspoon> rawtaz: you are a gentleperson and a scholar and I'll buy you a drink next time we run into each other in the street
[07:26:07] <rawtaz> nickspoon: what containers do you have - these two servers ones but what else?
[07:26:16] <nickspoon> That's it really
[07:26:30] <hackers> yeah rawtaz 3 hours helping some IRC person 
[07:26:34] <hackers> kudos
[07:26:56] <nickspoon> We're looking into containerizing some products at work but are in early stages, nobody knows how to do this stuff yet
[07:26:59] <hackers> nickspoon: answer his question!
[07:27:07] <rawtaz> ok. because in very broad summary what you should do is make them not be bridged, instead make them use internal networks which is usually some 172.x ones in docker. i do not know why your docker is bridging these containers, presumably it can be confed to not do that. that should solve your problems i think
[07:27:51] <nickspoon> Thank you, I'll look into that.
[07:27:58] <rawtaz> and also starting to use docker-compose will make it a bit simpler perhaps, but thats not required. the important thing is getting the networks right,t hats all really
[07:28:03] <rawtaz> ok. have a good morning :P

[08:09:21] <Czernobog> oh definitely not my own.
[08:09:27] <Czernobog> I am using this https://github.com/haiwen/seafile-docker
[08:10:16] <Czernobog> and I am getting this error:
[08:10:36] <Czernobog> Step 24/26 : COPY seafile-server-${SEAFILE_VERSION} /opt/seafile/seafile-server-${SEAFILE_VERSION}
[08:10:36] <Czernobog> COPY failed: file not found in build context or excluded by .dockerignore: stat seafile-server-: file does not exist
[08:13:42] <rawtaz> why are you building it? because the one at hub.docker.com is three years old?
[08:14:36] <Czernobog> Even if it's 3 years old, it doesn't support arm64 for raspberryPi
[08:14:44] <rawtaz> ooh right, you said. sorry

[08:15:42] <Czernobog> Any idea where I can get the folder seafile-server ?
[08:16:28] <rawtaz> what do you think it is?
[08:17:23] <Czernobog> I thought it was the other github with seafile-server but it didn't work
[08:17:43] <rawtaz> what do you think that file is?
[08:18:27] <Czernobog> urmm i don't know.
[08:18:34] <rawtaz> cmon, think ;)
[08:18:54] <Czernobog> Do i have to replace the version?
[08:18:56] <rawtaz> why are you doing this in the first place? you want to run a seafile server, no?
[08:19:02] <Czernobog> yes
[08:19:12] <rawtaz> then what could a file named seafile-server possibly be?
[08:20:02] <Czernobog> i don't know :/

[08:36:13] <Czernobog> I mean, I knew that but I didn't know where to find it
[08:36:16] <rawtaz> so i *presume* that you simply download that from the seafile releases and place it here so your Dockerfile can find it

[08:58:49] <L0j1k> hey about seafile
[08:58:51] <L0j1k> Czernobog: 
[08:59:06] <L0j1k> there are known issues with the "file encryption"
[08:59:12] <L0j1k> which render it completely useless
[08:59:27] <L0j1k> and remain unaddressed by the maintainer
[09:00:05] <L0j1k> imo i would go with nextcloud the fork of owncloud
[09:00:08] <L0j1k> offers delta sync
[09:00:15] <L0j1k> and actually gives you actual file encryption
[09:00:23] <L0j1k> seafile is like a CCP plant or something
[09:01:21] <Czernobog> I see. Okay, thanks for letting me know. I have already been running nextcloud for quite some time and I did not like it that's why I am trying seafile

[14:58:31] <BtbN> You can run whatever command you like in your container
[14:58:46] <BtbN> Obviously it'll just execute it normally, so you need to do whatever it takes to run SQL
[14:59:41] <BtbN> But do you really want to add first-time initialization stuff into your compose file? It'll try to add those users every time it start the container
[14:59:53] <olle> Yeah, but I'm not looking at Dockerfile build or so, it should be in docker-compose.yml, because our non-technical QA testers will run it.
[15:00:02] <olle> BtbN: Hm, maybe not the best
[15:00:19] <olle> It needs to work on Linux, Windows and Mac :d

[15:02:10] <olle> That's not the issue :) Our QA testers run Windows, devs run Linux/Mac
[15:03:01] <BtbN> Docker literally needs a Linux-VM to work on Windows
[15:03:25] <BtbN> So a compose file can safely just assume the containers run Linux

[18:46:37] <zoraj> rawtaz, I do not use docker-compose yet, I'm trying to learn step by step
[18:47:04] <rawtaz> so how do you run these containers? whats the full commands you used to start them?
[18:47:42] <zoraj> docker run --name container-database -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=zoraj -d mysql:8.0.27
[18:47:59] <zoraj> docker run --name container-app-server -d -p 8080:8080 -p 9990:9990 -it jboss/wildfly:20.0.1.Final /opt/jboss/wildfly/bin/standalone.sh -b 0.0.0.0 -bmanagement 0.0.0.0
[18:48:29] <rawtaz> ok. that is very easy to turn into a docker-compose.yaml file
[18:49:04] <rawtaz> what OS are you running docker in?
[18:49:13] <zoraj> Windows
[18:49:18] <rawtaz> ewww
[18:49:21] <rawtaz> ok i never did that

[18:50:05] <rawtaz> if you run `docker-compose help` do you get command not found or does that command exist?
[18:50:36] <zoraj> it does exist
[18:50:40] <rawtaz> good
[18:51:15] <rawtaz> then all you need to do to get this into docker-compose, which is very simple to use, is to create a file named docker-compose.yaml wherever you want.
[18:51:15] <zoraj> I'm trying to understand how docker works before going into this docker-compose, but if I had to learn this to achieve my need, I will
[18:51:39] <rawtaz> its really simple, and it might even help you understand docker in a broader sense, but meh, no biggie regardless
[18:51:59] <tabakhase> zoraj yes & no - docker-compose cant do anything more or less than plain docker commands -- but it makes it a bit more reasonable than having 345236546character long shellworms :D
[18:52:08] <tabakhase> its almost a 1:1 back&forth translation
[18:52:49] <rawtaz> so, considering that you arent using any -v arguments to your docker command, the data in your containers are currently saved,, in those contianers. i suppose that you are just testing things now, this isnt production stuff, rght?
[18:53:17] <zoraj> no, not production, I start learning docker
[18:53:19] <tabakhase> zoraj *after scrolling up on your problem* - IP adresses are the devil, never ever. - what youre missing is just a network that both containers belong to (then they can resolve another by name)
[18:53:41] <tabakhase> docker entwork create && docker network attach // "--net" in your runs should move you forward ;-)
[18:54:11] <tabakhase> (((the only difference compose would make for you is that compose automagically creates such a network, but you can do that manually just fine))

[19:03:58] <rawtaz> tabakhase: i agree, i never do it myself. but for ease of transitioning into docker-compose it made sense to show an example that 100% corresponds to the two run commands they used previously
[19:04:14] <zoraj> rawtaz, thanks, it's a good start for me, will dig more into it 
[19:05:00] <zoraj> tabakhase, my bad, old habit from lxd/lxc, I always set container name 
[19:05:16] <rawtaz> zoraj: also look at the more minimal https://kopy.io/oxDCB which is really all you need to run those two containers. if it was me, i'd use this instad. however there's other things to add, for your persistent storage of data etc. but this is just an example to help you understand it
[19:05:40] <rawtaz> zoraj: the thing is that when you use compose you dont have to fiddle with contianer names at all. the only thing you reference normally is the services name (web and db in this case)
[19:05:50] <zoraj> rawtaz, excellent !
[19:05:52] <rawtaz> thats why we dont feel it's needed to specify container name. compose manages that for us
[19:05:58] <tabakhase> zoraj last key from reading your messages up there -- the app obvs cant call "localhost" to reach the DB - each container has its very own localhost -- so you want to connect to the name/service "using dns to resolve the IP" - and having things in the same network will allow docker to intercept that DNS and translate "db:3306" into "172.12.32.1:3306" as needed  ((that "localhost" works for 
[19:05:59] <tabakhase> your workbench is cause of the published-port you have))

[21:11:41] <mehwork> Docker desktop constantly pops up saying there's an update. Most of the time i don't care. But 'skip this update' button does nothing. Is there a way to fix this annoyance since 'snooze' is making it popup just as much?

[21:12:16] <mehwork> feel like i'm in a 20 year old version of windows with this popup nonsense, yet i'm on a mac in 2021. Whoever designed this did something wrong 
[21:13:22] <rawtaz> you can install Little Snitch or Lulu and block those outgoing update calls. or you can blackhol the DNS name it uses for update checks.
