[03:29:16] <Hash> How is X mond N? Sounds like an incomplete question in English
[03:29:19] <Hash> I'm confused.
[03:29:26] <Hash> Are they asking about associative property?
[03:30:23] <Hash> X mod N == (X mod P) * (X mod Q) ? No
[03:31:16] <Hash> I think that's it.
[03:31:23] <Hash> Unless I'm totally wrong.
[03:31:47] <Hash> (X mod P, X mod Q) I will go with this choice. I'm not sure.
[03:36:04] <enick_937> Hash: I parse it as "How is (X mod N if N = PQ) represented in number theory?"
[03:36:04] <iz> if you are having issues w/ notation, don't think of the mod X at the end as an operation that happens
[03:36:23] <Hash> enick_937: oh ok
[03:36:24] <iz> i had issues w/ that when i started w/ modular math for crypto
[03:36:26] <Hash> Then I got it right.

[03:37:08] <Hash> Which key combination is used to decrypt and verify a digital signature?
[03:37:19] <enick_937> Or possibly "How is X mod N represented in number theory, if N = PQ?"
[03:38:10] <Hash> I am the sender. I hash message, encrypt message with my (Sender) private key. Recipient gets my message, takes my public key, decrypts my hash and hash the mssage to match against it.
[03:38:12] <Hash> I understnad that.

[03:38:39] <Hash> line 4 is correct answer, but I don't see how
[03:39:05] <Hash> why would I send a message and user the recipients private key to encrypt the hash that I'm sending
[03:39:12] <Hash> I don't undresntand how they word this.
[03:39:43] <iz> the question is just about the recieving and verifying, not the creation of the signature
[03:40:55] <Hash> recipient is the one who gets the message and hsa to decrypt using th epublic key of the sender
[03:41:02] <Hash> How is the recipients keys involved at all?
[03:41:38] <iz> i don't want to give away the answer, but if you read the question and the answers again.. idk, it should be clear
[03:41:50] <Hash> IT's only ever the sender who sends his message, encrypted hash with his priv key, along with his public key to the recipient. 
[03:42:08] <Hash> The recipient gets the message, the encrypted hash, and the public key

[04:05:12] <iz> you keep confusing yourself thinking the recepient's priv key is used in verification of the digital signature somehow, which it isn't
[04:05:25] <Hash> Then why jmetnion your kieys at all?
[04:05:29] <Hash> I'm so confusaed
[04:05:33] <MacGyver> Hash: That's the point. In *verification*, only the sender's key is used.
[04:05:34] <iz> just stop and take a breath.. you keep getting stuck on the verifcation of a digital signature part and keep ignoring that it says the first key is to decrypt the message and the second key is for verifying the digital signature.
[04:05:41] <Hash> Your keys play no part in this, in my logic.
[04:05:45] <MacGyver> Hash: But you keep forgetting that there is a separate encrypt/decrypt process here.
[04:05:46] <Hash> Why mention keys that don't even matter
[04:05:57] <MacGyver> Hash: Type out the process with these FOUR steps:
[04:06:03] <iz> FIRST you have do decrypt the message using the appropirate key, THEN you verify the signature
[04:06:05] <MacGyver> sign. encrypt. decrypt. verify.
[04:06:23] <iz> it's (decrypt an encrypted message) AND (verify a digital signature)
[04:06:33] <Hash> to me, when you decrypt, that's verification.
[04:06:41] <Hash> WHy is there an extra step that invovled your kieys
[04:06:41] <iz> it's not
[04:06:42] <Hash> I don't get it
[04:06:42] <MacGyver> That's wrong.
[04:06:46] <iz> decryption is decryption
[04:06:51] <iz> verification is verification
[04:06:56] <MacGyver> That's what I've been trying to tell you.
[04:07:03] <Hash> I Get that
[04:07:06] <Hash> I think
[04:07:07] <MacGyver> Forget about the RSA magic where signatures are encryption with a private keyi.
[04:07:09] <int-e> the goal of signing is to ensure authenticity of the message, that is, the recipient knows who sent it
[04:07:18] <iz> Hash: re-read the question outloud now
[04:07:24] <Hash> Which key combination is used to decrypt and verify a digital signature?
[04:07:35] <Hash> ok
[04:07:39] <iz> decrypt _and then_ verify a digital signature
[04:07:42] <Hash> and means simulatenously at the same time
[04:07:50] <iz> no, sequentially
[04:07:51] <MacGyver> You don't decrypt the signature.
[04:07:54] <Hash> and +then+ would mean do 1 first then the other
[04:07:54] <MacGyver> You decrypt the *message*.
[04:08:02] <Hash> it's not even written in english correctly
[04:08:05] <Hash> that's what tghrowing me off.
[04:08:14] <Hash> ohhhh
[04:08:15] <Hash> wait a min
[04:08:24] <Hash> Don't you encrypt the 'hash' with your priv key?
[04:08:29] <MacGyver> No.
[04:08:34] <Hash> and they decrypt the hash with my public key?
[04:08:38] <MacGyver> You *sign* the hash with your private key.
[04:08:48] <MacGyver> And they *verify* your signature with your public key.
[04:08:54] <Hash> signing is not encrypting?
[04:08:59] <iz> no
[04:08:59] <Hash> I'm confused with soem words
[04:09:00] <MacGyver> Oh for fuck's sake.
[04:09:04] <MacGyver> For the fourth time.
[04:09:05] <Hash> wait a min
[04:09:07] <MacGyver> Forget about the RSA magic where signatures are encryption with a private keyi.
[04:09:07] <Hash> really
[04:09:09] <iz> this is why terminology is important

[04:10:30] <Hash> I am the sender. I send you message, I hash the message content, I then encrypt the hash value using my private key. This  process is caleld signing.
[04:10:38] <Hash> Is this right or wrong?
[04:10:40] <MacGyver> Wrong.
[04:10:43] <Hash> Ohhhh
[04:10:46] <Hash> That's why I'm fucked up here
[04:11:08] <MacGyver> This is *only* true for one specific public key cryptosystem, and even then it isn't *really*.
[04:11:24] <MacGyver> You *sign* the hash value using your private key. This process is called signing.
[04:11:28] <iz> the process is called signing, not encrypting, no matter what happens behind the scenes
[04:11:33] <int-e> And using "encrypt" in a signing context is really hurting you here, a lot.
[04:11:43] <Hash> ok
[04:11:48] <iz> you encrypt/decrypt and you sign/verify
[04:11:52] <iz> they don't mix
[04:11:56] <Hash> What is signing?
[04:12:18] <int-e> You sign the message with your private key. Anyone with the corresponding public key can verify that signature.
[04:12:20] <Hash> the actual process of signign doesn't involve encryption of the hash value with my priv key?
[04:12:20] <iz> using your private key to sign a hash of your message
[04:12:29] <Hash> You sign the message with your private key. <- what does this mean?
[04:12:51] <int-e> But noone can forge a signature with just the public key (unless they have an extraordinary amount of luck or break the signature scheme)
[04:13:07] <MacGyver> Signing = creating a bitstring using your private key that can only be created using that private key but can be checked to have been created by that private key using the corresponding public key. But right now we DO NOT CARE about what goes into that "creating" step.
[04:13:46] <iz> yeah, the question is just about the receipient decrypting and then verifying the signature
[04:13:50] <MacGyver> Public key cryptography has *four*, not *two*, basic operations: encryption, decryption, *signing*, and *verification*.
[04:14:03] <Hash> Ok
[04:14:07] <iz> what key needs to be used to decrypt and then what key needs to be used to verify the signature?
[04:14:24] <Hash> I get all that. But why does your key pair play into this? What is your key used for at all?
[04:14:30] <iz> decryption
[04:14:31] <iz> dude
[04:14:52] <Hash> *sigh* I don't know what I'm missing. I'm soryr
[04:14:54] <Hash> I'll stop.
[04:14:56] <Hash> I'm just probably too stupid.
[04:15:01] <MacGyver> And right now we *do not care* how any of these four is implemented in terms of "raise R to the power of P or whatever", right? Banish that from your mind for a second.
[04:15:04] <iz> the recipient is getting an encrypted and signed message.
[04:15:23] <Hash> I'm soryr I don't think I'm going nto get it
[04:15:24] <iz> so you have to first decrypt it using a key and then verify the signature using a different key
[04:15:25] <MacGyver> So you have four operations, that implement two things: confidentiality and authenticity.
[04:15:31] <iz> really?
[04:15:36] <iz> it's right there dude
[04:15:42] <Hash> We're going in circles with the same words
[04:15:50] <Hash> Nothing new has entered here and I don't wiwh to wate your time
[04:16:07] <MacGyver> For confidentiality, YOU, the sender, needs to ensure that ONLY the recipient can decrypt what you send.
[04:16:11] <iz> maybe re-read this scrollback after you have had a break and can look on it w/ fresh eyes?
[04:16:28] <MacGyver> Now consider that *everyone* posesses your public key, but only you posess your private key.
[04:16:43] <MacGyver> Does it sound like you can get confidentiality with *your* public key and *your* private key?
[04:16:57] <Hash> MacGyver: I am sender. You are reciever. Why/how is your key pair involved here at all? Your key pair doesn't matter. Only mine does, since I am the sender. I don't understnad how you, the reciever, has anything to do her with you rkey pair.
[04:17:09] <Hash> I can't seem to grasp that.
[04:17:17] <MacGyver> Yes, I understand that this is what you're hung up on, and I'm trying to talk you through that.
[04:17:24] <MacGyver> Read what I said, think about my questions.
[04:17:28] <iz> Hash: 16:24 < iz> the recipient is getting an encrypted and signed message.
[04:18:10] <iz> 16:24 < iz> so you have to first decrypt it using a key and then verify the signature using a different key
[04:18:24] <Hash> You verify using my public key. Why your key has anything to do with verification is beyondme
[04:18:34] <Hash> I don't get why your key is even mentioned at all, in any step.
[04:18:37] <Hash> AT ALL
[04:18:37] <MacGyver> You're not reading what I say.
[04:18:37] <int-e> Hash: Which key would you use to encrypt a message for MacGyver then?
[04:18:38] <iz> what key would the recipient use to decrypt a message encrypted to them?
[04:19:13] <Hash> Sender's public key is used to decrypt the message encryptd by the sender's priv key. How is your key pair involved here?
[04:19:18] <Hash> why is it even mentioned
[04:19:19] <int-e> Hash: There's really only one choice if you want neither me nor iz to be able to read it too.
[04:19:19] <MacGyver> You want BOTH confidentiality AND authenticity. You are right now only thinking about authenticity. Don't. Think about confidentiality for a second.
[04:19:19] <iz> wut
[04:19:24] <Hash> I don't see what it has to do with any of this.
[04:19:34] <iz> Hasd: what key would the recipient use to decrypt a message encrypted to them? NOT VERIFICATION
[04:19:35] <mats1> detach the signing op from this whole thing
[04:19:37] <int-e> Hash: SO, no, this is definitely not what you want to do.
[04:19:38] <Hash> EVER. Your keypair hsould never be invovle heere. Inmy thinking. which is why I'm conrfused
[04:19:42] <mats1> it complicates the tale
[04:20:05] <iz> Hash: what key would the recipient use to decrypt a message encrypted to them? NOT VERIFICATION  ignore verification and just answer that question
[04:20:09] <MacGyver> Hash: Yes. WE understand YOUR thinking. It's wrong. Stop typing out your thinking and follow along with me for a minute.
[04:20:19] <Hash> im tring very hard.
[04:20:31] <Hash> i read everythging you guys said many times over
[04:20:35] <Hash> sorry for my stupidity
[04:20:48] <iz> ignoring verification, what key would the recipient use to decrypt a message encrypted to them?
[04:21:03] <Hash> whoever sent message, his public key.
[04:21:06] <iz> no
[04:21:10] <iz> ignoring verification, what key would the recipient use to decrypt a message encrypted to them?
[04:21:15] <int-e> Hash: So everyone can decrypt your message now.
[04:21:33] <int-e> Hash: Something is fatally wrong here.
[04:21:35] <Hash> see im missing something key/viatla in the underling process
[04:21:39] <iz> ignoring verification, what key would the recipient use to decrypt a message encrypted to them?
[04:21:39] <Hash> I think I mislearned something.
[04:21:48] <iz> just think about encryption/decryption
[04:21:57] <iz> ignore verification for a second and answer that question
[04:21:58] <Hash> I see what you mean.
[04:22:00] <Hash> Hang on 
[04:22:24] <mats1> can you derive the pubkey from a privkey in rsa?
[04:22:29] <Hash> If I send you message, has it with my public key, encrypt hash, send to you, then anyone with my public key can decrypt it and that's not good
[04:22:30] <Hash> I see.
[04:22:31] <mats1> or is that ecdsa
[04:22:32] <int-e> You always encrypt messages with the recipient's public key.
[04:22:40] <Hash> Ok now I'm seeing my process is failed.
[04:22:53] <iz> and the recipient decrypts using thier private key
[04:23:07] <iz> that's how encryption and decryption works
[04:23:09] <Hash> So I sign the message using your public key?
[04:23:13] <MacGyver> Hash: It's encryption / decryption, there's no hashing involved.
[04:23:14] <Hash> ohhhh
[04:23:18] <iz> no verification
[04:23:19] <Hash> THAT was the satep I was fucked upm on
[04:23:20] <iz> no signing
[04:23:21] <Hash> I think.
[04:23:28] <iz> dude
[04:23:35] <MacGyver> If I were to send iz a message, I have two options:
[04:23:39] <iz> there are two parts to the question
[04:23:51] <iz> decrypt and then verify
[04:23:57] <MacGyver> 1. Encrypt the message (directly) using my private key, telling iz to decrypt using my public key.
[04:24:11] <MacGyver> 2. Encrypt the message (directly) using iz's public key, telling iz to decrypt using iz's private key.
[04:24:12] <Hash> Forget the verirfication part yet.
[04:24:22] <iz> lol my eye is literally twitching
[04:24:23] <Hash> I am messing up the previous parts, whic is why rest is brokenin my head
[04:24:23] <MacGyver> Now consider that *YOU* also have my public key.
[04:24:24] <int-e> mats1: In practice, yes. The private key formats have the necessary information, breaking the symmetry between private and public keys. Also public exponents are ususally one of a couple of values 65537.)
[04:24:34] <MacGyver> Which one of those options allows ONLY iz to decrypt?
[04:24:53] <Hash> hmm
[04:25:19] <int-e> mats1: oops, meant to completely omit the 65537 because I forgot what the common values really are. 3, 31, 37, 65537? Were 257 or 17 ever popular?
[04:25:48] <MacGyver> I think we stopped using 3 though.
[04:25:55] <Hash> MacGyver: both?
[04:26:07] <MacGyver> Hash: How do you arrive at that conclusion?
[04:26:10] <Hash> oh hang on im the third party
[04:26:13] <Hash> hang on
[04:26:19] <Hash> and I have your keys too
[04:26:19] <MacGyver> Yeah. You're not supposed to be able to decrypt it.

Do I have the necessary prerequisites for understanding the books listed at https://gist.github.com/atoponce/ef0c369546abb4b2936f8725b95909f6? Will reading those books help me understand how programs like age and signify work? Do I have to read those books to

[21:52:05] <int-e> Then, youy have to convince them that the thing to do over SMS is TLS, out of all options.
[21:52:08] <Soni> having the ability to set the phone to TLS-only would be great

[21:52:25] <int-e> And then you can have a house warming party with the people left at that point.
[21:52:27] <Soni> no more spam, no more ads, no more 2FA codes
[21:52:53] <Soni> attempting this might be the best way to kill SMS for good
[21:53:00] <int-e> TLS didn't solve the spam problem
[21:53:17] <int-e> Nor did PGP :-P

[21:54:33] <Soni> int-e: nobody deploys PGP because key management sucks.
[21:55:09] <Soni> TLS is far easier to do key management with, and it actually provides PFS and whatnot.
[21:55:38] <Soni> oh yeah, there's that too, PFS. PGP doesn't.
[21:55:58] <Wulf> you shouldn't compare TLS with PGP. They serve different purposes ;)
[21:56:13] <Soni> yes, TLS is much more suitable for an IM than PGP.
[21:57:39] <Wulf> And for this purpose it's more suitable than coffee cups too. So?
[21:57:53] <int-e> (Also I'm in Europe. SMSs usually cost money here (or, at least, count towards a monthly quota that is large but far from inexhaustable). That makes the idea of doing a handshake over SMS completely ridiculous.)
[21:57:56] <Soni> (you could argue "just use omemo or the signal protocol over SMS", but ehh TCP over SMS goes brrr)
[21:58:17] <Soni> int-e: you don't wanna spare 10 messages for a handshake?
[21:58:25] <int-e> I don't.
[21:58:31] <Soni> meh
[21:58:54] <int-e> It would be per party, possibly per message.
[21:58:55] <Soni> over here, you usually have a limit of 1000 messages per week or something
[21:59:07] <int-e> If you don't repeat the key negotiation, poof goes your forward security.
[21:59:49] <Soni> ofc, this isn't considering the fact that messages get lost somewhat frequently
[21:59:49] <MacGyver> Also no E2EE, because it's TLS which, crucially, isn't end-to-end.
[21:59:59] <MacGyver> Which I tried to point out yesterday.
[22:00:06] <MacGyver> And involving the Internet PKI only reinforces that point.
[22:00:10] <Soni> MacGyver: TLS is, in fact, end-to-end, if you use it between the two ends
[22:00:26] <Soni> E2EE isn't a property of the protocol
[22:01:24] <Soni> case in point: you can run a relay bot over signal. it won't be E2EE.
[22:02:32] <int-e> anyway I will continue to treat this as a joke... or at best an intellectual exercise in what would be needed to make this work. It just won't happen.

[23:28:13] <riv> well you are an inspiration
[23:28:17] <Hash> I lost my brother this year. He is gone. I buried him myself, carried him, laid him down in the ground, and covered his grave. Still heart broken

[23:28:38] <Hash> Or so I thought.
[23:31:02] <riv> sorry to hear that
[23:31:20] <Hash> Thank you
[23:32:28] <Hash> You guys are patient and that's also helpful too. Many other channels have people who get upset easily and lose patience and then say mean things and/or ban you. 
[23:35:05] <Hash> riv: if you get the basic building blocks of understanding correctly, that's all that matters. Then you can build upon it more layers of information, step by step
[23:35:58] <Hash> riv: my study strategy is different. I snack on nuts and healthy snacks, like beef jerky and cachews an mixed nuts or protien bars while i study. I also only study for 10-15 minutes at a time.
[23:36:42] <Hash> Then I take a break for 5-10 minutes, go do something fun. Or sometimes i study or read for 20 minutes or if I'm really interested in it, I dno't even take a break. 
[23:36:57] <riv> sounds pretty comfy :)
[23:37:03] <Hash> that way i don't annoy myself, and I allow my brain to retain information.
[23:37:28] <Hash> 15-20 min of study 10 minutes of fun time. repeat.
[23:39:38] <Hash> I am going to ask noob question.

[23:40:15] <Hash> Symmetric keys can be transmitted using RSA/PKI?
[23:40:40] <Hash> The question on flash cards is, what is the issue with symmetric encryption, and the answer is secure key exchange
[23:41:12] *** Joins: dude12312414 (~test@gateway/tor-sasl/dude12312414)
[23:42:05] <Hash> So, I'm wondering, other than DH, which is a whole different thing, if you wanted to exchange symmetric keys with someone, you go through RSA? Right? Encrypt the symmetric key using someone's public key and sign it with your private key
[23:42:18] <Wulf> Hash: it's one issue. Asymmetric crypto can be used e.g. for signing / non-repudiation. Symmetric can't.
[23:42:45] *** Quits: Warped (~Warped@user/warped) (Quit: We Gone! Bye Bye)
[23:42:54] <Hash> Ok cool
[23:45:29] <Wulf> and asymmetric is based on math, which is cool. Makes reasoning about its security easier. Like: Nobody found a fast way to factorize large integers yet, despite trying for like 50 years. So it can be assumed that there is no way to really break RSA, aside from QC.
[23:46:05] <Hash> Which of the following is generally true about block sizes?
[23:46:09] <Hash> D. Larger block sizes increase security
[23:46:23] <Hash> I answered (on flash cards) C, block size is irrelevent to security
[23:46:27] <Hash> So why am I wrong?
[23:46:41] <Wulf> Hash: think about block size 1 byte.
[23:46:48] <Hash> I honestly thought block size doesn't matter, it's the key space 
[23:46:55] <Hash> 8 bit block
[23:47:06] <Wulf> Hash: yep, like AES with 8-bit block size
[23:47:26] <Hash> So I don't still understand why block size matters for security
[23:47:45] <iz> consider a lookup attack
[23:49:10] <Wulf> Hash: with a long block size, you usually don't encrypt the same block twice. With a tiny block size, you do all the time.
[23:49:32] <Hash> I see.
[23:49:54] <Hash> The chances of repetition are higher if block size is smaller.
[23:50:19] <Hash> longer the block size, the less chance of repeating data, which makes it different.
[23:54:44] <Alipha> Hash: https://sweet32.info/ is an attack against small (64-bit) block sizes. After encrypting 2^32 blocks, there's a good chance repetition will happen, which the chance only continues to increase as more and more blocks are encrypted
[23:55:28] <Hash> Oh I see
[23:57:39] <Hash> Ohhh
[23:57:51] <Hash> It is well-known in the cryptographic community that a short block size makes a block cipher vulnerable to birthday attacks, even if there are no cryptographic attacks against the block cipher itself. 
[23:58:21] <Hash> I had read that before somewhere but I mistakenly thought it was about key size.
