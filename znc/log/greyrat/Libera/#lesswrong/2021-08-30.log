[00:03:21] <PapuaHardyNet> I began rewatching OreImo recently, mainly because I grew up to OreImo's LNs and had a lot of nostalgia tied to the story
[00:04:41] <PapuaHardyNet> Gave up after four episodes. Not sure whether my nostalgia was misguided or the anime is worse than the LN
[00:05:36] <PapuaHardyNet> Or maybe Kirino is just too unbearable in the start of the series. That's a possibility

[00:20:41] <feepbot> <gwern> 'In Study 5 we examined whether a sample of Americans were aware of the negative effects of selfishness. For the most part, they turned out to have accurate intuitions— especially about the negative associations that selfishness has with social relations, psychological well-being, and number of children. Thus, whereas Crocker et al. (2017, p. 315) call the finding that
[00:20:41] <feepbot> selfishness does not promote well-being paradoxical, our study indicates that laypeople do not view it as such. Instead, the empirical finding that runs counter to lay intuitions is that selfishness is not associated with the highest incomes. Given people’s expectations, this finding is the real paradox of self-interested behavior. If people understood that prosociality pays,
[00:20:41] <feepbot> then selfish people might engage in more prosociality for selfish reasons. Under their incorrect beliefs, however, it is rational for selfish people to act selfishly.' heh

[11:40:42] <PapuaHardyNet> specifically, dealing with small talk. Small talk is so hard! It is basically RTS and impro combined

[11:45:00] <feep[work]> I don't
[11:45:32] <adiabatic> I'd be worried that I'd be optimizing for chatbot talk and getting extra weird for talking with normal people
[11:45:34] <feep[work]> idk, my attempt is, I try to get what fun I can out of conversations and then run a manual fairness filter over my behavior
[11:45:49] <feep[work]> this seems to mostly work
[11:45:58] <PapuaHardyNet> lool I wonder how that would work. What if a chatbot was my only conversation partner for a decade? How different would I be in a decade

[11:46:35] <feep[work]> <PapuaHardyNet> this bot ... was made for me!
[11:46:37] <PapuaHardyNet> > run a manual fairness filter over my behavior | sure, that's what we all do. the other person needs to get value for them to stick around

[11:48:56] <adiabatic> well, it's not just 4chan. More so /pol/ and possibly the other NSFW boards.
[11:50:09] <PapuaHardyNet> I mean, with a chatbot, you are only using the chatbot as a sort of "trigger" for your own imagination. You are your own company
[11:50:47] <adiabatic> reminds me of the discussions about circling on Gray Mirror.
[11:50:55] <PapuaHardyNet> it should be much better than simple solitary isolation, and the more... the more imaginative you are, the more fun you'll have
[11:51:14] <PapuaHardyNet> this is the fifth time I've read a circling reference. I'll have to read up on it

[15:05:24] <nshepperd2> because indeed adding a superfluous batch dimension just for the convolutions makes it copy the tensor, and use the worse memory layout that doubles everything
[15:09:35] <nshepperd2> and for some reason it keeps all of these around too, even though i should have gradient checkpointing

[19:20:43] <two2thehead> PapuaHardyNet, yeah basically what your linked study is saying : "Conclusions: Slow breathing techniques act enhancing autonomic, cerebral and psychological flexibility in a scenario of mutual interactions: we found evidence of links between parasympathetic activity (increased HRV and LF power), CNS activities (increased EEG alpha power and decreased EEG theta power) related to emotional control and psychological well-being in healthy subjects. Our 
[19:20:44] <two2thehead> hypothesis considers two different mechanisms for explaining psychophysiological changes induced by voluntary control of slow breathing: one is related to a voluntary regulation of internal bodily states (enteroception), the other is associated to the role of mechanoceptors within the nasal vault in translating slow breathing in a modulation of olfactory bulb activity, which in turn tunes the activity of the entire cortical mantle."

[21:14:24] <kuudes> uk central scenario for opening up was 36000 more deaths
[21:15:30] <kuudes> and who expects 1/2000 of europeans to die before december https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/who-warns-of-236000-more-covid-deaths-in-europe-by-december/ar-AANU2a3
[21:15:40] <Robomot> WHO warns of 236,000 more COVID deaths in Europe by December (High transmission rates across the continent ‘deeply worrying, particularly in the light of low vaccination’, WHO says.)
[21:18:01] <SDr> https://i.imgur.com/NF50bA2.png    isn't it a bit weird, that on a YoY basis, the vaccine isn't salient on neither new cases, nor death stats?
[21:18:59] <kuudes> SDr, imo it is indeed a bit weird if one looks at uk, usa or israel as success story for "new normal"
[21:19:45] <SDr> like, um, every december I fly back to hungary to spend time with family; last year, I wasn't able to do it, on account of quarantining reqs; and given YoY stats, it seems the exact same stuff will happen this year as well? 
[21:19:47] <kuudes> uk's current death rate is 3x compared to finland's rate so far, and 4/3 compared to finland's peak rate
[21:20:06] <kuudes> do you have us citizenship?
[21:20:19] <kuudes> so far usa does not allow noncitizens from eu, isn't it?
[21:21:12] <SDr> kuudes, green card, which means I can, it's just that it's 14 days quarantine in .hu, then 10 days in cali
[21:21:47] <kuudes> hmm, so .hu is allowed but iirc .no or .fi are not
[21:22:39] <kuudes> personally, it feels to me that the world seems insane opening up. I must be miscalibrated, this does not seem to make much sense otherwise
[21:22:40] <SDr> given that I generally go there for 2 weeks total, it would essentially mean spending the entire time at family; with whom I can't spend more than 3 consecutive days
[21:23:18] <gwern> hungary sounds overrated. maybe you should go somewhere else
[21:28:19] <feepbot> <gwern> uploads https://www.gwern.net/docs/psychology/1987-shepard.pdf
[21:28:38] <SDr> eeeh. there's a lot of truth to that; OTOH, current pace means that I will see my parents for ~30 days total within their life expectancy; going somewhere else (like my preferred destination, vrc) would cut into that

[21:30:13] <gwern> dunno. risk homeostasis?
[21:31:09] <kuudes> "Results: Twelve days or more after the booster dose we found an 11.4-fold (95% CI: [10.0, 12.9]) decrease in the relative risk of confirmed infection, and a >10-fold decrease in the relative risk of severe illness. Under a conservative sensitivity analysis, we find ≈5-fold protection against confirmed infection."
