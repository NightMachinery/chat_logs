[00:20:16] <buster> Thoams, what seems to be the trouble? :) The two partial derivatives of the scalar field give you the two components of the vector.
[00:20:56] <Thoams> hi buster :)

[00:27:47] <buster> You've rather lost me there. Perhaps I should have used the word 'differentiation' instead. In any case, it's really a prerequisite. It might not be a good idea to try to explain any so-called 'multivariable calculus' before you can walk.

[00:28:05] <buster> Having said that, if your scalar field is denoted s(x, y), then for any x and y, consider the function f(t) = s(x+t, y). Then the partial derivative (ds/dx) at (x, y) is just (df/dt) at t=0.

[00:29:43] <Thoams> t being time, x altered by time
[00:30:29] <Thoams> ds is delta S - delta the change in my value at my grid reference -
[00:30:44] <Thoams> divided by delta x?
[00:31:05] <Thoams> and I've gone cross-eyed.
[00:32:03] <Thoams> the difference between x at t0 and x at t1!
[00:32:05] <Z-module> you need to learn about and get relatively comfortable with ordinary derivatives of one-variable functions, before tackling this setting
[00:32:53] <Thoams> this has a direct relation to the complexity - which I'm currently avoiding - of moving from 2d to 3d
[00:33:07] <Thoams> I must move from 2d to 1d to comprehend it

[03:34:20] <buster> tusko, that's only closedness. it's a necessary condition for exactness, but not a sufficient condition.
[03:34:39] <tusko> that's the only test they've taught me :(
[03:34:59] <buster> it can show that an equation is *not* exact
[03:36:05] <anovick> the best approach I found for this so far was comparing the function f(x) which I want to integrate with another function g(x) that is easier to calculate integral of in this range [2pi, 3pi]. I found g(x) = 1 / x, which satisfies g(x) => f(x) and via a theorem I get integral(g(x)) => integral(f(x)). however the g(x) I found isn't tight enough
[03:36:32] <tusko> buster, so what is the other test?
[03:36:36] <tusko> ugh, how frustrating
[03:36:55] <buster> find the psi in https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/DE/Exact.aspx
[03:37:13] <tusko> anovick, [2pi,3pi] is congruent to [0, pi]
[03:37:23] <tusko> or at least those integrals should be the same
[03:37:27] <tusko> idk if that helps
[03:37:47] <anovick> tusko: umm for sinx they are, but not for x
[03:37:55] <buster> tusko, ok, there's poincaré's lemma
[03:38:08] <anovick> I have f(x) = sinx / x
[03:38:24] <tusko> anovick, sorry m8 this might be over my head probably
[03:38:27] <buster> if the domain is 'nice' then closed implies exact.
[03:38:59] <tusko> buster, ok this might make sense then.
[03:39:27] <tusko> So checking the cross-partials says 'this might be exact' and successfully finding the potential function says 'yup. exact.'?
[03:40:54] <buster> yeah, or at least finding out somehow that the potential function is out there somewhere
[03:41:14] <tusko> anovick, just guessing here really, but what about if you did like a Taylor series on the integral to estimate it and showed -that- is bounded by 2pi/3 and 1/pi?

[06:13:01] <david_hilbert> What? Multivariate polynomials are certainly studied
[06:13:22] <johndoe_> david_hilbert: yes ... but a "polynomial" in the sense you're using it only uses addition and multiplication by definition
[06:13:29] <johndoe_> there are infinitely many higher order operators
[06:13:43] <johndoe_> beyond multiplication
[06:13:48] <david_hilbert> What kinds of operators?
[06:13:57] <johndoe_> thus you can form infinitely many more nontrivial examples of 'algebraic structure' in the real world
[06:14:06] <johndoe_> that math cannot express well
[06:14:21] <david_hilbert> Most "operators" I know are something like integral with so and so kernel

[06:17:07] <johndoe_> david_hilbert: no matrix multiplication has same order as regular multiplication
[06:17:13] <david_hilbert> kernel in fourier transform is something like e^(-2pti)
[06:17:14] <johndoe_> its not about the things youre multiplying
[06:17:21] <david_hilbert> for example
[06:17:29] <david_hilbert> People research all kinds of operators all the time
[06:17:34] <david_hilbert> There are millions of operators out there

[06:18:42] <david_hilbert> Already I rarely see expressions like x^x

[06:36:44] <david_hilbert> 10 is finite, 10^100 is ,10 ^100^100 is finite
[06:36:51] <johndoe_> proofs are bounded no?
[06:36:56] <johndoe_> programs arent

[06:37:06] <johndoe_> theres no infinite proof lol
[06:37:25] <david_hilbert> Bounds such as max so and so steps, and so and so memory cells are what programming needs

[06:39:32] <david_hilbert> well not by definition, but the point still holds

[06:44:30] <johndoe_> its simple as that
[06:44:31] <johndoe_> really

[06:45:03] <johndoe_> so of course they fall short as well
[06:45:21] <johndoe_> programming on other hand can deal with general recursion because it makes certain tradeoffs in terms of rigour and formality

[06:49:15] <johndoe_> example is weierstrass function
[06:49:35] <johndoe_> the fact that that is an object of study means theres a problem and its only 'best way' to encode state
[06:49:38] <johndoe_> in proofs
[06:50:51] <johndoe_> polynomials could probably be eliminated if there were a trivial concept of a 'loop'

[09:09:27] <Fangs> cokernel_hacker: I'm not sure what there is to solve there
[09:09:29] <dude12312414> depends in what way
[09:09:34] <Fangs> y in terms of x is just as given
[09:09:39] <dude12312414> numerically you can compute x up to arbitrary precision
[09:09:56] <Fangs> ah, given y, solve x
[09:10:01] <dude12312414> analytically there is no elementary function whose inverse is tanh(x)/x
[09:10:06] <cokernel_hacker> yes, exactly
[09:10:12] <cokernel_hacker> ok, so I need to solve it numerically
[09:10:17] <dude12312414> but you could probably do something with Lambert-W functions or something
[09:12:10] <Fangs> (this is unrelated, but isn't what cokernel_hacker want is to solve the equation in terms of y?)
[09:13:03] <dude12312414> well that's trivial
[09:13:13] <cokernel_hacker> I want x s.t. tanh(x)/x=1/2
[09:13:41] <cokernel_hacker> there are two solutions which are approximately -1.91501 and 1.91501
[09:13:57] <Fangs> I've forgotten most math terms. I thought what's trivial is to solve y in terms of x
[09:14:05] <Fangs> (you just plug in x into tanh(x) and divide it by x)

[09:27:36] <Fangs> so we're basically solving for the difference between two functions tanh(x) - 2x = 0
[09:28:17] <TOB_CyxoB> cokernel_hacker, x=0.54931 (exp(x*2)-1)/(exp(x*2)+1)
[09:28:17] <Fangs> we want to minimize this, naively, but 0 might not be minimum.. so idk.. (tanh(x) - 2x)^2 insead
[09:28:20] <dude12312414> with calculus you could prove things like "there are exactly n solutions for y in some subset"
[09:28:46] <TOB_CyxoB> cokernel_hacker, seems to produce 1/2
[09:29:45] <TOB_CyxoB> cokernel_hacker, the other one is comples as in: 0.54931 + 3.14159i
[09:30:00] <cokernel_hacker> TOB_CyxoB: d'oh
[09:30:09] <cokernel_hacker> indeed, tanh(log(-.5/(.5-1)-1/(.5-1))/2) is 1/2
[09:30:51] <TOB_CyxoB> *complex
[09:30:52] <Fangs> 2 (-2 + sech^2(x)) (-2 x + tanh(x)) = 0
[09:30:59] <Fangs> dude12312414: this is so much less tracable
[09:31:02] <dude12312414> was the original question to solve tanh(x)/x = y or tanh(x) = y?
[09:31:03] <Fangs> its cursed
[09:31:10] <cokernel_hacker> tanh(x)/x = y
[09:31:18] <dude12312414> ok
[09:31:49] <TOB_CyxoB> Oh... sorry
[09:32:36] <TOB_CyxoB> dear maxima managed to reduce it to x=(%e^(2*x)-1)/(%e^(2*x)*y+y)

[14:49:50] <Fangs> tempate: how would you describe this as an ideal in R[x,y,z]?
[14:50:10] <tempate> Fangs: if you want me to be completely honest, and I recall it correctly, I think I wasn't convinced with the answer you gave me
[14:50:19] <Fangs> (can you describe the ideal with just one polynomial? i.e. is it a principal ideal? or do you need two?)
[14:50:40] <Fangs> tempate: its fine, question it. I dont know alg geom, and even if I do always check what other people say
[14:51:30] <Fangs> tempate: its imporant to note that R[x,y,z] and C[x,y,z] are not principal ideal domain, meaning there are ideals that are not generated by one element
[14:51:36] <tempate> I guess we could have something like f(x, y, z) = y (or z)
[14:52:04] <Fangs> just y = 0 gives you the x-z plane, ditto z = 0 with x-y plane
[14:52:15] <tempate> Yeah, right
[14:52:47] <tempate> so... V(y, z) ?
[14:52:54] <Fangs> tempate: int his case I hope you're convinced that R[x,y,z] / (y = 0, z = 0) is approriate here
[14:53:10] <Fangs> and as a ring, R[x] as the set of functions on your x-axis seems to make a lot of sense
[14:53:10] <TheWild> Fangs: you mean (...,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,...)?

[15:15:12] <acresearch> makes sense?

[15:15:24] <Fangs> oh nvm I'm an idiot
[15:15:30] <Fangs> I didn't scrolled down...
[15:16:52] <Fangs> also what buster said
[15:16:54] <tempate> acresearch: I believe you would. Have you tried it out with any examples?
[15:17:29] <tempate> oh, the mean of the mean...
[15:17:38] <acresearch> tempate: so each list in 1M points, and i have 30K lists... sooo experimenting would be difficult hence i am asking here for insight
[15:17:39] <tempate> then not
[15:19:05] <tempate> acresearch: changing my answer to yes once again
[15:20:03] <tempate> if all lists have the same number of elements I don't see why it'd make a difference
[15:20:27] <Inline> if you have two lists [x1,x2,x3] and [y1,y2,y3] the mean of the first is [x1/(x1+x2+x3),...] the mean of the second is [y1/(y1+y2+y3),...] now if you want to find the mean of both you get [(x1+y1)/(x1+x2+x3+y1+y2+y3),....]
[15:20:28] <tempate> Fangs & buster: alright, thanks
[15:21:45] <Inline> as long as the lists are the same size, otherwise you have to jump in order to correct for the indices....
[15:22:30] <Fangs> C[x,y,z]/ (x^2 - y, x^3 - z) , so in this ring x^2 = y and x^3 = z
[15:22:36] <Inline> i.e. the means just add
[15:22:47] <acresearch> tempate: ok let me try
[15:23:07] <Fangs> tempate: I propose we try this map f: C[x,y,z] -> C[w] with f(x) = w, f(y) = w^2 and f(z) = w^3
[15:23:29] <Fangs> if you can show that the kernel is given by previous ideal, then we can say the quotient ring is iso to C[w]
[15:23:39] <Fangs> and C[w] is an integral domain, hence ideal was prime
[15:24:06] <buster> acresearch, you know there's a streaming algorithm (O(1) additional memory) for mean and variance?
[15:24:28] <acresearch> buster: no i do not know, what do you mean? please elaborate

[15:25:00] <Fangs> tempate: substitute C[w] with C[t]
[15:25:09] <tempate> Fangs: does f have to be a polynomial?
[15:25:19] <Fangs> tempate: no f is a ring hom
[15:25:24] <tempate> ok
[15:25:34] <Fangs> it sends polynomials to polynomials
[15:25:40] <buster> one of knuth's maybe (he certainly wrote about it). i might have a link somewhere
[15:25:52] <Fangs> tempate: in the paramtereization, we end up equating (x,y,z) = (t,t^2,t^3)
[15:26:37] <Fangs> so the ring homomorphism f: C[x,y,z] -> C[t] with f(x) = t and f(y) = t^2 and f(z) = t^3 seems to make certain sense to my naive self
[15:27:09] <Fangs> (and indeed the set you described with t seems to be a line in C^3, so the quotient ring should reflect that)
[15:27:15] <tempate> yes, it does make sense
[15:27:41] <buster> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms_for_calculating_variance#Online
[15:28:04] <Fangs> if you want to be anal, you might want to prove that C[t] is an integral domain too, it might be a good exercise if you aren't comfortable with ring theory yet

[15:52:51] <rubiksdream> Fangs convex functions aren't necessarily differentiable, but what is true is that they have left/right hand derivatives
[15:53:10] <zacts> I'm trying to understand Calculus a bit.
[15:53:39] <rubiksdream> but in essence what you are saying is the argument, except with 'differentiable -> continuous' replaced with ' left derivative exists -> left continuous' (and the same with left replaced with right)
[15:54:05] <rubiksdream> so left/right derivative existing is easy, you just need to notice that the limits in question are monotone (and bounded below/above_
[15:54:08] <Fangs> is |x| convex?
[15:54:17] <Fangs> or maybe -|x|
[15:54:27] <rubiksdream> yes it is certainly convex
[15:54:33] <rubiksdream> |x|
[15:54:52] <rubiksdream> -|x| is concave
[15:54:54] <Fangs> ok, the derivative doesnt exists at 0, left and right is 1 and -1 I think. so thats a counter example for what you said
[15:55:07] <Fangs> or an affirmative example rather
[15:55:17] <rubiksdream> its an affirmative example
[15:55:23] <rubiksdream> so the opposite of a counterexample
[15:55:29] <Fangs> yeah its getting late here, sorry :D
[15:55:30] <buster> an example
[15:55:41] <rubiksdream> no worries
[15:56:02] <rubiksdream> anyway, convex basically means increasing secants
[15:56:11] <buster> anticountermeasure
[15:56:39] <rubiksdream> so you can use that to show left/right hand derivatives exist: let h > 0  , and suppose h is decreasing to 0 (staying positive), then f(x+h) - f(x)/h is decreasing and is bounded below
[15:56:49] <zacts> I'm trying to understand how Calculus can be used as a tool within a context.
[15:56:52] <rubiksdream> similarly for h<0 and h increasing, f(x+h)-f(x)/h is increasing and bounded above
[15:56:59] <rubiksdream> so both limits exist
[15:57:23] <Fangs> I'll copy paste this convo and reread it in the morning
[15:58:11] <rubiksdream> now the trick to showing right differentiable -> right continuous is: [f(x+h)-f(x)/h]*h -> 0 as h->0 from above, because [f(x+h)-f(x)/h] is bounded near 0 from above
[15:58:21] <rubiksdream> and you do the exact same thing for left continuity

[16:01:10] <Fangs> rubiksdream: let x, y in (a,b). assume x <= y I was thinking the other day that maybe I want this two picture (x+a)/2 --- x --- (x+y)/2 to get (____?) and to look at x --- (x+y)/2 --- y to get a lower bound on f(y)
[16:01:21] <Fangs> (I think the former was to get an upper bound on f(x))
[16:01:35] <Fangs> then do a comparison, but I have to assume f(x) - f(y) > 0 here
[16:02:21] <rubiksdream> yeah the general idea sounds something like what you would do
[16:02:51] <Fangs> I'll have to actually finish the proof to see if it'll work

[20:48:14] <Z-module> Hi. Really fun thing I learned recently. By AC-magic, we previously knew that there exists a partition of R^3 into disjoint unit circles (so each set in the partition is congruent to {(x,y,0) : x^2 + y^2 = 1} ). The new wrinkle, that I never would have imagined possible, is that you can do the same thing but where no two circles in the partition are "linked" through each other.

[21:18:44] <Z-module> corollary: probably not same frequency either
[21:18:59] <cherim_> He would ask "so what aren't you satisfied with in your solution?"

[21:20:52] *** Quits: bosspotato (~bosspotat@user/bosspotato) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[21:21:17] <buster> Where's the group of symmetries? I'm sort of nearly there. It's the subgroup of the affine group with ae-bd=1. But if I knew exactly what I meant by that, I would have written it down already :)
[21:21:18] <cherim_> Physicists would probably prefer a direct embedding into SL(3, C) as (a b c // d e f // 0 0 1) with the only constraint det=1
[21:22:10] <cherim_> SL(2, C) x| C^2  is more Poincare group style, also OK
[21:22:19] <buster> perhaps a silly question, but what's the 3d vector space there?

[21:22:31] <johnkeats6> buster, the linear part is an action of SL(2, C), and the affine part is any translation, so i believe it's SL(2, C) x| C^2

[21:27:43] <buster> just saying mp+nx maps to (a+d+c/p)p + (b+e+f/x)x and showing it's invertible is probably ok. the prerequisites for this book are pretty light.
[21:27:54] <buster> ugh. or whatever.
[21:29:19] <cherim_> What does division by p even mean
[21:30:27] <buster> is it so bad? c is a momentum, p is a nonzero momentum in the same direction ... call p "1 kg m s^-1", for example
[21:31:09] <cherim_> What mathematical object is p so that you can divide by it? Clearly not just a number since p and x do not commute
[21:31:48] <buster> ok
[21:31:56] <johnkeats6> yeah i wouldn't worry too much about this exercise. this non-commutative geometry stuff is esoteric :>
[21:32:16] <johnkeats6> learn the harmonic oscillator carefully, that's the most important thing in the book
[21:32:17] <cherim_> You can look at https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0512169.pdf to reconsider maybe
[21:32:49] <Z-module> B-T definitely requires it since at least two of the B-T subsets must be non-measurable. I don't know if this congruent-circles things requires it. THere are (relatively) explicit parititions into different-size circles, though.

[22:50:22] <acresearch> mornfall: so is there no way to calculate the final SD without combining all values of the three lists?
[22:50:51] <buster> johnkeats6: cherim_: http://mathb.in/60917 does this explain my difficulty? in my experience, using a 3d space for affine (or projective) stuffs goes like the second part. but what we have is not that.
[22:50:54] <acresearch> mornfall: i.e get SD seperatly? then combine SD? to get the final SD?
[22:50:56] <mornfall> acresearch: unless your data has some special form, then no
[22:51:09] <int-e> Z-module: you can basically only rotate around the (x,y,z') axis where z' varies, ignoring the xy plane
[22:51:50] <acresearch> mornfall: the reason for my question is because i have very large data points    30k lists each with 7M points     i need to find the final SD but i cannot combine the lists into RAM memory
[22:52:03] <int-e> Z-module: because z determines where on the circle you are.
[22:52:15] <acresearch> mornfall: but i can find the SD of individual lists
[22:52:26] <buster> if we can call the missing y's in the second part a "typo"
[22:52:29] <Z-module> all the circles involved having their top point in one horizontal plane and their bottom point in another is what makes that happen.
[22:52:36] <int-e> Z-module: that was my intuition, I didn't even read the proof after understanding the restriction of the circles.
[22:52:53] <johnkeats6> acresearch, you can certainly compute sd iteratively without having to hold all values in memory

[22:53:04] <acresearch> johnkeats6: how?

[23:20:43] <mornfall> acresearch: also you are not even close to doing what i told you to do
[23:21:09] <acresearch> mornfall: i calcualted the standard error right?
[23:21:26] <mornfall> acresearch: you are calculating a bunch of nonsense, tbh…
[23:21:32] <acresearch> mornfall: hmmmm
[23:21:57] <acresearch> mornfall: ok let me go back and see how to calculate the standard error, i might have seen the wrong article
[23:22:18] <mornfall> acresearch: just do what i told you to do, there isn't anything else to it, really
[23:22:19] <buster> (a b c)^T = (A A' A'')^T, and so on. they are mutually transpose.
[23:22:28] <cherim_> In you mathbin paste the same happens. p, x, 1 are basis vectors of a Weyl algebra. Not coordinates. As I said, they can't be numbers already by noncommutativity
[23:22:50] <cherim_> Like e1, e2, e3
[23:23:19] <cherim_> So no wonder you get transposes
[23:23:30] <acresearch> mornfall: calculate sum of error for each list, add all sum of errors, divide by N, sqrt  right?

[23:24:09] <acresearch> mornfall: oh
[23:24:10] <mornfall> can't just take the mean of the sublist
[23:24:24] <acresearch> mornfall: wait,   i am confused now
[23:24:54] <acresearch> mornfall: no when calculating the standard error  i value-mean   where mean is of the while dataset?
[23:25:56] <mornfall> acresearch: for l in [X1, X2, X3]: { means.append(sum(l)); lens.append(len(l)) } ; mean = sum(sums)/sum(lens) ;
[23:26:06] <cherim_> To be honest, if you are reading a physics book on "operators and canonical quantization" and try to interpret momentum and coordinate as numbers (simultaneously) in the exercises section, the book is not that good
[23:26:21] <mornfall> acresearch: as i have explicitly said before… sum _all_ the data points and divide by the size of the entire data set
[23:26:50] <loopspace> What am I missing here? The highlighted (typoed) relation doesn't seem to be true https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/2HsxSo5c/image.png

[23:28:39] <acresearch> mornfall: probably,  either way i am not getting the excpeted final SD,,, so i guess the closest approach is to just calculate the SD of each sub list and take a mean of all the SDs

[23:41:42] <buster> cherim_, i don't doubt you, but i don't follow what you're saying. in my paste, in the first section, p and x are always vectors (elements of the vector space, in this case an algebra), never coordinates. I abused the same letter T for the matrix (with respect to the basis {p,x,1} for a subspace) and the underlying linear transformation.

[23:46:14] <mornfall> then you probably didn't fix it right
[23:46:55] <acresearch> mornfall: you can see my fix in the last code i sent you      final SD = 1.82  i got 1.59
[23:46:55] <cherim_> What is your question about the exercise then? Are there any remaining?

[23:48:50] <cherim_> I understood that you don't like that 1) bottom 3x3 is the transpose of the top, 2) that Tp was not in the span <x, p> or some "2D space"
[23:49:33] <buster> cherim_, I'll work on it. probably as soon as I can formulate a question that makes sense, I'll be able to answer it. I appreciate your efforts

[23:50:02] <cherim_> The first is answered (but it's not even very important since groups tructures are isomorphic), the second is inconsistent with the meaning of p, x
[23:50:28] <cherim_> p'=ap+bx+c in the statement is already not in a "2D space"
[23:50:49] <cherim_> Since RHS is a combination of 3 linearly independent objects

[23:51:59] <cherim_> Well, technically you can glue 1 and one of (p, x) by "fixing a representation as coordinate/momentum". But it's better left untouched
[23:52:12] <int-e> acresearch: one subtle detail is that stdev() divides by (n-1), where n is the sample size; so it's the usual unbiased estimator for the standard deviation.
[23:52:39] <buster> mm. i suppose i'm misinterpreting the other part of the question, where it asks for a group of symmetries of the complex 'plane' C^2.
[23:53:10] <int-e> acresearch: But this whole computation is rather intricate. https://paste.debian.net/1204705/  seems to work
