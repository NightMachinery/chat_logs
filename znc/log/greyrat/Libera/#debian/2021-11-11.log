[01:09:37] <tjcarter> nihilazo: what I have in mind is a pure blend aimed at having all the modern language stuff sorted nicely, but otherwise trying to conserve system resources (particularly diskspace)
[01:09:50] <nihilazo> I used the graphical mode to install today, and I used the unofficial firmware iso

[01:09:57] <xx> tjcarter: I'm not from here originally, just moved here a few years back.

[01:11:49] <nihilazo> I used to be a ridiculous distro- and desktop/WM-hopper

[01:20:46] <jbm> xx, if you want to fix your system, the best thing I can think of is gparted-live-iso --- which is based off debian --- uses similar kernel/boot structures, makes it easier to mount/check things..
[01:20:52] <somiaj> xx: Not the same, here it means you break the license if your change it, anything that is DSFG can be freely modfied without breaking the licsense.

[01:22:16] <somiaj> outside of the license that is, but in this case this was back when authors would put a statement (often commented out) about the copyright and that this statement must be included in all copies/modificiations of the document, and it is each and every file, thus an immutable subsection which breaks the DFSG

[01:23:46] <xx> ventoy is the answer to all the not-working setups with rufus/unetbootin/...
[01:23:52] <jbm> and the iso's do not need to be tampered with or anything.. just copy the iso to USB to the ventoy-formatted usb, and it just works..
[01:23:57] <knghtbrd> jbm: one of my little projects is to become well-enough versed with GRUB to be able to help people more easily roll their own ventoy-type setup.
[01:24:39] <jbm> knghtbrd, ventoy is script-kiddie toy, you just run the install-script and it nicely sets up that usb for ya :)
[01:24:59] <jbm> knghtbrd, there is' grub's multi-iso boot support --- but that takes more skill -- the kernel needs to support iso-booting.
[01:25:02] <knghtbrd> The first such thing I encountered was easy2boot
[01:26:31] <jbm> xx, when you talk lvm, cryptsetup, or mdraid --- that I use the gparted-live iso, which has the latest tools for these extra partitioning things..
[01:26:54] <jbm> xx, and the installer can do those things.
[01:27:10] <knghtbrd> jbm: my biggest objection to systemd was documentation, or lack of it, at all the different levels it needed to exist. There are IMO about four such levels. If your documentation is all down here (holds hand low) with complex manpages and RTFS Luke, that's a big ask for people to be able to play with it.
[01:27:43] <jbm> xx, -- the mdraid --- though the luks IIRC you'll have to request in the advanced section of the installer to load "luks" installation..
[01:27:59] <knghtbrd> One alternative is the DWIM (do what I mean) scripts like Ventoy or Easy2Boot ‚Ä¶ but those don't move the needle any for their users understanding.

[01:30:44] <jbm> knghtbrd, it fixes both grub-pc(bios_and grub-efi

[01:31:18] <jbm> knghtbrd, if I hose the grub? i just boot up with eithe the debian-install iso or gparted-live iso..
[01:31:57] <knghtbrd> See, and nowadays, I'm just about at the point where I just type the commands into grub to one-time boot the system, and then go fix it from there.
[01:32:03] <jbm> knghtbrd, the reason why I don't bother with boot-repair iso, is because I have a lot of linux installs on this system, and I want to make sure I fix the specific grub/grub.cfg locations I am after

[01:33:56] <knghtbrd> (And looking at that package will go a long way toward teaching you how to do that yourself.)
[01:34:02] <jbm> knghtbrd, i also use gparted pxe-boot -- for not bothing with any iso --- there's guides online so you can fix grub this way as well..

[01:35:22] <jbm> knghtbrd, the grub ability to boot isoz is a separate thing --- but the "booting kernel" needs to have iso-boot capability.
[01:35:36] <jbm> knghtbrd, for ventoy I don't think it requires the kernel to have iso-boot capability..
[01:35:59] <jbm> knghtbrd, iirc it does some kind of funny magic :)
[01:36:54] <jbm> knghtbrd, i'll lokk into that another time -- but I always use a Zalman VE-350 device if Ventoy cannot boot a particular iso. :) -- it is the same principle as the Ventoy menu-chooser -- but instead it is a USB-device with an LCD screen allowing me to choose an iso file.
[01:37:16] <jbm> knghtbrd, and it's awkward to work with -- so I prefer the ventoy-boot mechanism... easier to choose isos with it....
[01:37:44] <jbm> knghtbrd, are you new to linux?
[01:38:15] <jbm> knghtbrd, the problem with grub, and all of that fun stuff, is there's variations of it..
[01:38:31] <jbm> knghtbrd, and it is its "own" operating system -- it has its own modular system..
[01:39:12] <jbm> knghtbrd, depending on what you're trying to "fix", you'll need to make sure your grub-modules (for grub itself) are in your grub configuration...

[01:46:12] <knghtbrd> Calamares didn't seem to present an immediate way of doing that, and the old installer lacked the userspace tools I wanted (cryptsetup)
[01:46:14] <jbm> knghtbrd, you can use cp -xaP /source/. /target, and then fix grub + fstab --- or clone the UUID via e2image copy -- or using tune2fs -U ....
[01:47:00] <jbm> knghtbrd, as long as you copy the system and grub works, then it doesn't matter how/where you originally installed debian.  You can go from a flat-partition setup, and throw the filesystem into LUKS or LVM, and have debian booting from there.
[01:47:28] <jbm> knghtbrd, I've done this several times over some years... P2V -- cloning from vbox to a bare-bone system...  it's actually like 3 steps...
[01:47:42] <jbm> knghtbrd, and really all that's needed is "cp -xaP" --- nothing "dd", or that sort.
[01:47:55] <jbm> knghtbrd, dd just ends up copying deleted/orphaned data..
[01:48:02] <jbm> (and is bad for SSD's anyways)
[01:48:37] <knghtbrd> jbm: What I did was boot the live installer, configure it for a legally blind cave dweller who needs everything big and dark mode, open the LUKS partitions (I have 32TB worth of them, but I only needed about 4TB for the array in question), created the LVs I needed, ran debootstrap, chrooted in, wrote fstab, crypttab, set up /etc, ran some dpkg-reconfigures, created user, installed and configured

[04:59:46] <Wikiwide> Why does stable have firefox-esr version 78, and not 91?
[05:00:44] <vakera_pingveno> khoa: Yes, actually, and you can even encrypt your second drive!
[05:01:18] <oerheks> Wikiwide, the answer is in the ESR part
[05:01:41] <xx> Wikiwide: because 91 cannot be built on debian-stable
[05:01:52] <xx> hence it will remain at 78 for the forseeable future
[05:01:59] <Wikiwide> oerheks: Mozilla website gives Firefox ESR version 91. Not in debian package, though.

[05:27:21] <xx> I know I know "universal distro" and all that, but that's the reality
[05:27:38] <Wikiwide> xx: Which web browser exists for browsing the web which is not present in Debian but is present elsewhere?

[05:35:54] <Wikiwide> xx: Well, Goanna fortunately still exists and isn't abandoned. And given how Mozilla has dived into developing its modern Rust-Gecko engine, there are still some people thinking that an alternative browser is a good idea.
[05:36:21] <xx> didn't mozilla lay off a huge number of rust devs in the last few years?
[05:38:18] <Wikiwide> My personal line of thought is: throw away tabs, bookmarks, history, session, built-in pdf viewer, download manager - in the sense of delegating them to other parts of desktop environment.
[05:38:21] <Wikiwide> Let window manager think of tabs, session manager think of history/session/bookmarks, external pdf viewer open PDF files, and external download manager handle all downloads from all apps.
[05:39:24] *** Quits: Sokomine (~Sokomine@user/sokomine) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[05:39:33] <Wikiwide> Then the haughty "web browser" becomes simply "HTML viewer", which, alongside with email client, RSS feed reader, PDF reader, and whatever else, is just one of many things allowing to browse the web.
[05:41:03] <Wikiwide> Well, HTML/CSS/JS viewer. Oh, and IRC/IM would be in their own IM app (like telepathy with idle plug-in), not in a web page.
[05:42:46] <xx> Wikiwide: I think there was a web browser that wanted to do that
[05:42:55] <xx> maybe part of suckless-tools?
[05:43:07] <Wikiwide> And Tilix would forget about tabs, too - delegate to window manager. Which ties in nicely with global session management, instead of individual app-by-app session management.

[12:09:54] <rainbof> no in 5.10 it NOT works and this is reason for this question.

[12:10:40] <PMT> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W%5EX
[12:10:45] <PMT> But that's just a guess.

[12:14:18] <rainbof> beckoff is some manufacturer of industry PLC computers.
[12:14:21] <rainbof> this is the modules: https://github.com/Beckhoff/BBAPI

[12:17:11] *** Quits: fcinq (~irc@network.g33k.host) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[12:17:20] <rainbof> but i think the real problem is why is this function disabled (exist somewhere discussion about configuration kernel ?).
[12:17:22] <PMT> Also, bcachefs just got very happy about their snapshots.
[12:17:28] <knghtbrd> Khepra: But it doesn't matter what btrfs was like in 2019 if it's stable NOW. And I've read that it is, which is why RH introduced it. That they've UNintroduced it with prejudice suggests maybe not.
[12:17:34] <PMT> rainbof: i just linked you two commits which explain what they're trying to do.
[12:18:44] <rainbof> PMT: many thanks! it looks like the root of problem.
[12:21:28] <PMT> That is quite the driver. "Let's lob executable bits from userland into kernel pages and run them."
[12:25:40] <Khepra> knghtbrd: what do you mean? RH dropped btrfs like hot potato. Did you mean "Stratis"? that's RH's product
[12:26:53] <Khepra> and btrfs is far from stable, I just had a production server meltdown weeks ago. problem is the bad design, it's not a bug that can be fixed, that caused the mess. it's poorly designed. "fixing" that requires rewriting from scratch and 10 more years probably

[13:30:38] <Haohmaru> what could be the reason for taking a long time to "connect to the network" ?
[13:34:22] <Khepra> Haohmaru: network manager?
[13:34:35] <Haohmaru> that's a LAN with a few computers behind the ISP's router, there's some sort of wifi involved too if it matters, and DHCP, the DHCP i think is supposed to give particular computers particular IP addresses, not random ones every time
[13:35:10] <jelly> consult your dhcp server's and dhcp client's logs
[13:35:42] <Haohmaru> i think it's not DHCP entirely, because..
[13:35:48] <Khepra> in addition to DHCP, I think NM also does connectivity tests, like "Internet availability" tests
[13:36:10] <PerfDave> DHCP is not *supposed* to give particular computers particular IP addresses unless it's been explicitly configured to do so. Many DHCP server implementations will *tend to* give the same address to the same client unless the pool is exhausted, but that's coincidence
[13:36:27] <Haohmaru> few days ago when i was using the debian machine just to SSH into the other computer in order to upgrade it, the network connection was "vanishing"
[13:36:47] <jelly> I wonder which implementations accidentally do that, because isc dhcpd sure doesn't seem to
[13:36:57] <Khepra> PerfDave: I'd say it's more of a "rule" than execption for most if not all DHCP servers I worked with, binding IP they assign to MACs

[13:37:26] <Haohmaru> that is.. the machine is connected, LAN works fine, i do some stuff over SSH or just sit doing nothing, suddenly silence i try pinging machines on the network "ping: connect: Network is unreachable"
[13:37:30] <PerfDave> Khepra: OK, but I wouldn't rely on it without explicit configuration
[13:37:50] <Khepra> sure
[13:38:11] <Haohmaru> PerfDave yeah, one of my collegues adjusts/configures the DHCP to do that

[13:39:20] <Haohmaru> jelly yes, altho the link from this side to the other side where the internet comes from goes over something like a wifi, because it's over the street into the almost-neighbour building
[13:39:20] <Khepra> Haohmaru: can you ping the router itself?
[13:39:48] <Haohmaru> that's what i'm pinging every time there's "something not right"
[13:39:55] <Khepra> oh. journal/syslog will log wifi layer (which is lower in the stack from tcp) disconnecting. do you see that?
[13:40:15] <Haohmaru> Khepra the computer is NOT connected via wifi
[13:40:34] <Khepra> Haohmaru: okay so back to previous question. can you ping the router/gateway itself
[13:40:46] <Haohmaru> more like, the two sides of the "office" are linked with some sort of short-range pointed antennas
[13:41:09] <Khepra> so there IS wifi somewhere in that topology between you and the router?
[13:41:12] <Haohmaru> because we either didn't want to run a LAN cable diagonally or something like that

[13:42:04] <Haohmaru> let's say "main office" is where the ISP's router is, the internetz comes from there, and i'm pretty sure the DHCP server is there too
[13:42:30] <jelly> Haohmaru: does your side of that wifi L2/L3 link have an IP address you can ping and can you, when this happens?
[13:42:59] <Haohmaru> then there's this antenna thing pointing at "office2" a bunch of meters outside into another building - i'm here, there's another antenna picking that up, and here we have routers too, the computers are wired with LAN cables

[13:43:45] <Haohmaru> yes
[13:43:52] <jelly> so it's an L2 link
[13:44:03] <Haohmaru> when everything's "right" i can ping the ISP router (1st IP address)
[13:44:37] <Haohmaru> i'm chatting from the 2nd computer, which mainly runs crapdows
[13:44:51] <Haohmaru> obviously i instantly know if the internetz vanishes here
[13:45:02] <jelly> if it goes bad it's basically as if the cable between two switches is bad.  Your network splits.  You can't reach the L3 gateway because it's on the other side
[13:45:30] <Haohmaru> but it doesn't, more like the debian machine suddenly goes out of the network and/or has trouble connecting to the network

[14:40:56] *** Joins: dselect (~dselect@debian/bot/dselect)
[14:41:01] <fatal> it's not broken?
[14:42:01] <Khepra> stable has 4.19.1  (and that one worked fine few months ago before I switched to sway)
[14:42:06] <fatal> and like i said before you can get the latest i3 working on debian stable
[14:42:27] <PMT> fatal: you seem to be misunderstanding my statement. I didn't say you couldn't. I said you were unlikely to get help from this channel if you do.
[14:42:38] <fatal> Khepra: you got wayland working? kudos to you.
[14:43:11] <Khepra> fatal: there really was nothing to it. apt install. sway. yay.
[14:43:21] <fatal> heh
[14:43:38] <Haohmaru> what's this "avahi-daemon Joining mDNS multicast group on interface enp2s4.IPv6 with address <some address>" "New relevant interface enp2s4.IPv6 for mDNS." "Registering new address record for <some address> on enp2s4." ?
[14:44:22] <PerfDave> Haohmaru: mdns allows you to do hostname resolution via multicast as well as "traditional" DNS.
[14:44:29] <jelly> irrelevant
[14:44:29] <Khepra> however ... there's.... issues. firefox not rendering context menues most of the time. there's some weird pipe breakage in foot, but I can't tell if that's foot or sway causing it. xwayland causes no redraw issues with directx steam proton thingy when you "alt-tab" away...
[14:44:50] <PerfDave> I use it on my local network, because my crappy ISP router doesn't do hostname -> IP resolution, but I can just "ssh $hostname.local" and it works via avahi
[14:45:13] <Khepra> fatal: but so far the increased security placebo is stronger than the desire to go back to xorg and i3 :)

[14:57:18] <Haohmaru> PerfDave so i editted the network connection settings from the network manager dialog stuff, i disabled the ipv6 DHCP crap completely - still can't easily get into the network, then i tried changing the ipv4 settings to manual and punched in the address and other settings as usual - instantly connects to the network 10 out of 10 time

[15:06:31] <Khepra> fatal: wayland is not software per se (unless you consider libwayland which is just an implementation), so there's nothing to write in rust. you'd need individual wayland compositors in rust, like the upcoming System76's

[18:13:26] <DonAlex> Afternoon peeps. How close are we to getting the Wifi blob working on Pi400. Apprently we are waiting on a new DTB but I tried copying the one form raspbian and it barfed. They have one called bcm2711-rpi-400.dtb but I am guessing the 5.10.0-9-arm64 is not compatible

[23:31:45] <PMT> I think I usually use something like -axHAX.
