[09:17:13] <labrador> a 32 bit system
[09:17:38] <nickgaw> Like are device file names and shells different?
[09:19:57] <nickgaw> So the hurd is not around for 64 bit systems?
[09:21:05] <labrador> no,the hurd is actually pretty bad at being a kernel
[09:21:40] <nickgaw> Like from a users point of view what differences would I notice about linux and the hurd?
[09:22:31] <ln> does hurd support bleeding edge hardware such as USB?
[09:22:43] <oerheks> Sata?
[09:22:57] <labrador> i actually don't have a lot of idea,but hurds hardware support is worse than bsd
[09:23:19] <nickgaw> Like in doing basic tasks like mounting drives and basic file management would there be much difference and does audio work in the hurd?
[09:23:19] <labrador> i never used hurd

[10:34:49] <nickgaw> Are there tools that I can use to mygreate my ext4 to btrfs without destroying everything?
[10:35:37] <Affliction> btrfs-convert builds the btrfs structures around ext*, and uses the copy-on-write features of btrfs to keep an image of the old ext fs
[10:35:46] <nickgaw> How long does it take to run on a hard drive and will I have to do much work after the converting is complete?
[10:35:55] <Khepra> Affliction: if you're talking about Paragon's NTFS patches, afaik that's not yet mainlined
[10:36:11] <Affliction> pretty fast, since it just works on metadata
[10:36:24] <Affliction> and, you'll have to update /etc/fstab and possibly your grub config
[10:36:31] <Khepra> still, fixing also requires userland support to process and organize data. I still think Windows is teh only authority on that one.
[10:36:53] <Affliction> nickgaw: as suggested above though, good idea to have a backup just in case
[10:37:04] <Khepra> nickgaw: the conversion tools are, from what I hear, very buggy. make sure you have very good backups

[10:39:46] <Khepra> problem with btrfs is that every otehr kernel release has some significant bug, and given how slow kernel upgrades happen in debian, btrfs is generally a terrible experience in debian

[10:40:35] <Affliction> I run btrfs on most of my personal stuff, haven't hit any major issues ina while
[10:40:48] <Khepra> there's a big warning on debian wiki tho.  https://wiki.debian.org/Btrfs
[10:40:56] <Khepra> some of it is outdated in 2022, some is not.
[10:41:12] <labrador> Rodon, windows would be ext
[10:41:16] <Affliction> But yeah, one of my servers hit a bug where a kernel thread would run 100% CPU
[10:41:29] <Affliction> And kept doing so until I rebuilt the filesystem
[10:41:30] <labrador> oh not that sorry exfat
[10:41:37] <labrador> For tvs probs fat32
[10:41:38] <Khepra> the part that's not is that btrfs is affectionately called "enospc" by its users. it's dead easy to run out of space even with more than half disk free
[10:42:01] <Khepra> Affliction: that bug still exists on 5.14, last version I've tested
[10:42:14] <Affliction> hm
[10:42:26] <Khepra> and there's some dragon in 5.15 that the #btrfs folks ar warning against, but I haven't been paying attention, I dropped btrfs from production
[10:42:26] <Affliction> Any idea what went wrong?
[10:42:28] <nickgaw> So what happens with this bug?
[10:42:51] <Khepra> you get a process stuck at 100% for hours or until reboot
[10:42:59] <Khepra> usually happens after a flurry of activity on the disk

[10:47:21] <Khepra> I've been bitten by btrfs on a production server. enospc. basically, what happens is this. a disk died, and server went belly up, rebooted degraded. now btrfs, as badly designed as it is, started wriitng out single blocks instead of continuing raid1 chunks
[10:47:42] <Khepra> that ate pretty fast into unallocated space and ran out, even though there were tens of GB in raid1 chunks
[10:48:04] <Affliction> Yeah, at work we run ext4 on the app servers, zfs on storage.
[10:48:27] <Khepra> btrfs couldn't use those because, badly designed, it wanted signle chunks in degraded mode.  boom. bye server. no way out, no way to savage as it doesn't have 1 byte anywhere to rebalance so

[11:16:45] <Affliction> and maybe they'll eventually merge
[11:16:46] <labrador> I guess I dont even think its a problem to begin with
[11:16:46] <Khepra> but that's human nature, hard to achieve. it's easier to ragequit and fork on github and have it "my way", as experience has shown over and over and over and over and over again
[11:16:55] <Khepra> 300+ distros on distrowatch and counting
[11:16:56] <labrador> and will end
[11:16:57] <Affliction> or stay forked, and follow their own path
[11:17:36] <Khepra> Affliction: and neither fully satisfies the use case because time has been lost forking and fighting and now the devs are burnt out
[11:17:43] <Johann> Khepra: you are not arguing against foss you are arguing against competition
[11:17:45] <Affliction> Fair point
[11:18:02] <Khepra> Johann: I'm arguing that FOSS theory and principle isn't compatible with human nature, and we get crap out of it
[11:18:22] <Affliction> Perhaps it's more, an argument for modular software
[11:18:27] <Khepra> I'd also live in fully FOSS world, even though I don' tknow what to do with the source 99.9999% of the time (and I'm a python dev!)
[11:18:30] <Affliction> Perhaps modules that "do one thing and do it well" :)
[11:18:43] <labrador> Khepra, not FOSS
[11:18:44] <at0m> i'm with Khepra on this. there's some great forks, like yt-dlp from youtube-dl recently, or fluxbox from blackbox, but those are exceptions
[11:18:46] <labrador> free software
[11:18:48] <Khepra> but having that freedom, knowing that _someone_ would know what to do and add a useful bit here or there
[11:18:57] <Affliction> Then, instead of forking the entire software, you could just write or fork the module.
[11:18:58] <labrador> Freedom can be used and misused
[11:19:05] <labrador> Does not mean we resrtict them
[11:19:10] <Khepra> unfortunately, you get GNOME and systemd wars|haters, and new distro every otehr week.
[11:19:10] <Affliction> But, that only works for architecting new projects

[11:20:56] <Johann> Khepra: but you could argue the exact same about all companies. What's the point of having competition, let's just have one big company so we don't split working time and for better efficiency
[11:21:39] <Khepra> Johann: no, that's the other extreme side
[11:21:56] <labrador> no thats exactly the point
[11:22:04] <labrador> Companies start and die all the time
[11:22:08] <labrador> So do forks
[11:22:11] <Khepra> the truth is in teh middle. two, three, four desktop paradigms? sure, there's space. but let's count how many desktops are there, and WMs and how much dev time is spread over all those tiny projects
[11:22:14] <labrador> Its the result of freedom
[11:22:19] <labrador> And is good
[11:22:23] <labrador> Embrace it
[11:22:53] <Khepra> also there's no true competition here, is it. take a look at so many programs that essentially do the SAME thing but time was wasted in split development
[11:22:57] <Khepra> useradd vs adduser.
[11:23:05] <labrador> The truth is Khepra,are you going to force someone working on say ratpoison to work on GNOME?
[11:23:12] <labrador> You cannot force anyone
[11:23:16] <Khepra> how many partitioning programs? fdisk, cfdisk, gdisk, sgdisk, parted, how many more
[11:23:34] <labrador> They would rather not work than work on something they hate
[11:23:47] <Khepra> and you get into the situation that you need ALL of them because program A does what B doesn't and B does what A doesn't and C adds somethign els, and D is needed because edge use case X, etc....

[11:24:26] <Khepra> labrador: that's exactly teh human nature I'm talking about
[11:24:29] <Johann> no they cannot, they were designed differently because people disagreed on what is important in such program, on what interface to use, etc
[11:24:35] <labrador> And thats inherent
[11:24:40] <labrador> No way to solve that
[11:24:46] <labrador> People will always disagree
[11:24:49] <Khepra> Johann: but, in case of partitioning programs, they all do 90%, if not more, SAME THING
[11:24:55] <labrador> learn to agree to disagree
[11:24:56] <Khepra> it's literally nuances where they differentiate
[11:25:03] <Johann> yes they do, but you are still missing the point
[11:25:14] <labrador> like I use kde
[11:25:20] <Johann> people believe they brought somethoing new
[11:25:20] <labrador> I would not use gnome

[11:27:44] <Johann> it's false, that's how competition works. You can't develop every idea ever. You have to make decision, different projects make different decision and when one project have great idea and develop good things it is usually implemented in others too, just like private company will look at what others are doing and redo what worked
[11:27:55] <Khepra> I've been a maintainer and user of FreeBSD longer than linux. In FreeBSD, we didn' thave these problems. "Hey, which progrram I use to partition?" one and only: gpart. which program for encrypted block device? one and only: geli. etc...

[11:29:23] <Johann> and bsd benefit the eco system variety because bsd looks at what is done to decide what feature to implement
[11:29:56] <Khepra> well I'm talking specifically about FreeBSD as a whole. different BSD, unlike different linux distros, have some MAJOR differentiation criteria
[11:30:16] <Khepra> different goals and design principles. in gnu/linux world, distros all use the same packages.

[11:48:43] <Aarch64debian> can i get rid of theirs
[11:48:49] <Khepra> you can't even know if you put a sniffer outside of your box. you'd see encrypted traffic, and no way to know wht's inside it
[11:49:12] <Affliction> You might be able to infer something by where the traffic is going
[11:49:23] <Khepra> it's futile. you've lost the battle. the only way to be sure is two things:  a) !ripley method     b) build your own kernel
[11:49:27] <Affliction> But then, maybe not.
[11:49:36] <uuidNuniq> you use kernel from nobody... you take risks...
[11:49:49] <Khepra> I'm exaggerating to drive a point that the question itself is a bit ridiculous.
[11:50:26] <Khepra> but jokes aside, I was serious when I said that the kernel can do things the userland is simply oblivious to

[13:45:30] <Khepra> the Q&A says there should be one, yes.
[13:45:37] <Haohmaru> i've not fiddled with "cron" much
[13:45:46] <Khepra> personally, I'd be more worried about all that "atime" file list collection.... what does THAT mean. which files.
[13:46:54] <Haohmaru> i was wondering what the "vote" on the graph means really.. does it know whether i use a given package or not
[13:47:50] <Khepra> according to the first Q and A in teh FAQ, I'd _assume_ it does, based on atime
[13:48:24] <amacater_> It knows you have it installed - so figures for cron might be pretty much every machine, figures for nvi much smaller
[13:48:28] <Haohmaru> so it.. sorta.. checks the "access time" on the .exe kinda?

[16:05:43] <Khepra> Aarch64debian: so, do you understand this so far, becasue you (and we) are running in circles now
[16:05:52] <Khepra> is it clear what you have to do?

[16:06:42] <amacater_> Aarch64debian: You're running a non-Debian kernel perpared by huawei.
[16:07:44] <amacater_> If you install a Debian kernel, on non-ARM hardware, it would put entries into grub - it wouldn't automatically delete the earlier one but keep it as a backup.
[16:08:47] <amacater_> You need to work out what happens when you boot - how you boot, whether with u-boot or whatever, and what happens when you install a new kernel.

[19:14:32] <thpho> hi there. i'm hardening a debian server and just wondered why phpmyadmin would be installed with all directory permissions be root:root in /usr/share/. since the apacheconf is strict in following symlinks (SymLinksIfOwnerMatch) it breaks after chowning phpmyadmin to www-data:www-data.
[19:14:32] <jelly> 2.3 of what
[19:14:38] <Khepra> mesa
[19:15:03] <Khepra> this amdgpu thingy stabilized since I switched to wayland. it's terrible under xorg, crashes once or twice a day
[19:15:13] <jelly> thpho, maybe don't chown stuff in /usr/share at all
[19:15:44] <jelly> Khepra, but isn't mesa version that 20.3.x or 21.3.x thing
[19:15:54] <thpho> @jelly would love to not to do it, but feel weird to have have phpmyadmin files belong to root:root all the way.
[19:16:09] <Khepra> jelly: 21.3 I meant. typo'd
[19:16:18] <Khepra> has some nifty fixes for amdgpu, so I can't wait
[19:16:29] <Khepra> thpho: quite the contrary
[19:16:46] <jelly> thpho, ah ,"feel weird" sounds like something opposite of "hardening"
[19:16:53] <Khepra> it's a security practice that web apps are owned by root and there's dedicated upload directories for the webapp running user, www-data or whatever
[19:17:05] <Khepra> PHP being able to modify own code goes against any hardening practices
[19:17:21] <jelly> if you're doing hardening you'd best try to understand _why_ you're doing specific steps
[19:17:30] <Khepra> also running webapps under default www-data is also a hardening anti-pattern
[19:17:54] <jelly> risk making things worse than maintainer set them up, otherwise
[19:17:55] <thpho> as-is: all files in /usr/share/phpmyadmin are owned by root:root and served via apache2
[19:18:04] <Khepra> that makes sense
[19:18:08] <jelly> that's great
[19:18:38] <jelly> better: run php in fpm, separate user, not www-data
[19:18:45] <thpho> so why would i have /var/www/html be owned by www-data:www-data at all, if that makes sense?
[19:18:48] <Khepra> configure uploadable directories specifically for the user phpmyadmin runs as (and I _really_ hope you're not using mod-php, that's like super major antipattern)
[19:18:56] <thpho> fpm is set up this way already. good one.
[19:18:58] <jelly> alternatively, run phpmyadmin in its own container
[19:18:58] <Khepra> thpho: because defaults
[19:19:25] <Khepra> nobody said debian is hardened up to the brim out of the box. quite the contrary, it's made as accessible and usable as possible
[19:19:35] <Khepra> usability <--> security   . opposite sides of teh spectrum.
[19:20:53] <jelly> is phpmyadmin actually getting sec patches in debian these days?
[19:20:54] <thpho> khepra: thank you!
[19:21:20] <jelly> the packaging used to be sluggish and fixes delayed, last time I looked

[21:05:18] <dob1> Khepra, it was not "banned" by Linus ?
[21:05:33] <Khepra> no, it wasn't.
[21:05:50] <Khepra> it's very much installable and supported in debian, even on rootfs.
[21:06:47] <Khepra> ZFS is even open source, it's just that it doesn't tickle the GPL compatibilty and some people in the kernel community are on a crusade against it.
[21:07:01] <dob1> one of them is Linus?
[21:07:03] <cdhowie> it should be noted that btrfs isn't "flaky over USB", but defective controllers/firmware that don't respect barriers can trash a btrfs filesystem, and many USB drives have such bad controllers
[21:07:06] <Khepra> which is incredible, they're on a crusae against Free and Open Source Software. that just happens to be slightly GPL incompatible.
[21:07:15] <cdhowie> the failure is with the drive, not with USB

[21:07:32] <cdhowie> neither does ext4, that's not the point
[21:07:40] <Khepra> they're incomparable
[21:07:54] <Khepra> transid failures can't brick your entire filesystem in ext4, like they do in btrfs because usb hiccuped
[21:08:00] <cdhowie> my point is that USB is not the issue, and there are plenty of USB drives that work fine with btrfs
[21:08:01] <Khepra> dob1: Linus and GKH
[21:08:19] <Khepra> and my point is that btrfs is very sensitive to hardware issues and USB and easy to get transid failures
[21:08:26] <cdhowie> just make sure you aren't using a shit drive
[21:08:52] <dob1> I take a look at zfs, never used it
[21:09:23] <cdhowie> btrfs is very sensitive to hardware that lies about what it's doing
[21:09:40] <Khepra> yes. buggy firmware crap.
[21:09:50] <Khepra> zfs isn't, so there must be something about btrfs too.
[21:11:36] <cdhowie> zfs is probably not so trusting that the drive does what it says it's doing
[21:11:47] <cdhowie> which is probably a good quality
[21:13:02] <Khepra> it's designed more robustly, yes. at the expense of no balance-like block pointer rewrite, but that's... good :)

[21:43:41] <enoq> apt_key has been deprecated
[21:44:33] <sney> apt-key still works, it will just give you the deprecation warning
[21:44:48] <sney> the "correct" way is to place the key in /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d.
[21:44:52] <enoq> using ansible right now and not sure how to procede

[21:45:07] <enoq> I don't think there's a specific plugin for that
[21:45:21] <sney> some 3rd party repos do not distribute keys that work with the trusted.gpg.d method, so apt-key still works.l
