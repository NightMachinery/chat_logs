[19:48:17] <nejimban> mostly theoretically I guess
[19:48:32] <nejimban> often we don't know what it is
[19:49:44] <nejimban> it gives you a way to compute in K[A]
[19:50:07] <nejimban> it's just K[X] mod p(X)
[19:50:26] <laurus> Is the point that since we have C^n = N^(1) \oplus \cdots \oplus N^(k) where N^(k) = N_{d_j}(a_j) where a_j are eigenvalues of A and d_j are their "indexes", i.e . N_{d_j}(a_j) is nullspace of (A - a_j)^{d_j}
[19:50:46] <laurus> Then the minimal polynomial somehow like, goes on the left hand side of this?

[19:56:37] <nejimban> if I'm not mistaken the minimal polynomial on N_{d_j)(a_j) is of the form (X-a_j)^k with k ≤ d_j
[19:57:12] <laurus> nejimban: So, the minimal polyomial m_A is the product of those (X - a_j)^k 's
[19:57:42] <nejimban> yes, in your decomposition the a_j are already distinct
[19:57:53] <nejimban> (I guess)
[19:57:56] <laurus> Yes they are
[19:58:25] <laurus> So the point is that any x \in C^n is in the nullspace of the minimal polynomial?
[19:58:44] <nejimban> that's badly said but yes
[19:58:57] <laurus> And also x nonzero can be uniquely represented by a sum of some generalized eigenvectors (one or more)
[19:59:05] <nejimban> what you mean (I guess) is that p(A)(x) = 0 for all x in C^n
[19:59:10] <nejimban> which is true
[19:59:36] <laurus> nejimban: I actually meant that for any x, p(A)x = 0 (which I think is the same)

[21:48:16] <ghostbuster> does anyone have a good intuitive explanation for why the unit vector derivative in polar coordinates d-theta is pointing radially inwards
[21:48:56] <river> i dont actually know what you mean
[21:48:59] <river> do you have a diagram of this?
[21:49:13] <johnkeats6> ghostbuster, no it isn't
[21:49:34] <ghostbuster> i can take a screenshot from the book i'm reading
[21:49:38] <johnkeats6> d/dtheta points tangential to the circle centered at the origin through each point
[21:49:56] <ghostbuster> i found this when searching google for alternative explanations, the diagram is similar http://www.physics.udel.edu/~szalewic/teach/419/cm08ln_polar.pdf
[21:51:26] <ghostbuster> if r-hat points radially outwards, and theta-hat is orthogonal to that, it's tangential to the circle, and then i want to take the time derivative of r(theta) (where theta is a function of t), then also need to take derivatives of the unit vectors, right?
[21:52:31] <Galois> "tangential to the circle" is not "radially inwards"
[21:52:49] <ghostbuster> theta is tangential, but what is d/dtheta?
[21:53:01] <Galois> theta is an angle; it can't be tangential to anything
[21:53:11] <ghostbuster> theta hat I mean, sorry
[21:53:19] <johnkeats6> theta hat is the physicist's notation for d/dtheta
[21:53:22] <johnkeats6> they're the same thing
[21:53:31] <ghostbuster> so it's not a vector?
[21:53:35] <johnkeats6> it is a vector
[21:53:49] <Galois> in any case, theta hat is tangential to the circle, as indicated in the diagram; this is not "radially inwards"
[21:54:23] <ghostbuster> Galois: sorry I'm being unclear - what is the derivative of theta hat?
[21:54:36] <johnkeats6> at least if we identify derivations with vectors as is usual
[21:54:40] <Galois> ok, now you can answer this question
[21:54:59] <Galois> increase theta by a small amount; see how theta-hat changes
