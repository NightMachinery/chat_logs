[10:24:43] <Zipheir> amazigh: It's going to be a lot easier to work with htlatex, I guess.  pandoc has serious issues with some sections.
[10:24:55] <Zipheir> (Re: R7RS HTMLification)
[10:28:24] *** Quits: karlosz (~karlosz@136.56.98.53) (Quit: karlosz)
[10:35:23] <amazigh> yes
[10:37:49] <sham1> Pandoc markdown might make things easier because one could compile it both to good looking LaTeX'd PDFs and also HTML. Just food for thought for the future
[10:50:00] <s-liao> amazigh What is HTMLification?
[10:54:17] <amazigh> sham1: my thought exactly
[10:54:28] <amazigh> s-liao: turning latex to html
[10:54:50] <amazigh> turning the R7RS-small to html
[10:55:04] <sham1> Makes it easier to link to, to reference, to browse
[10:55:12] <amazigh> to edit..
[10:55:15] <sham1> Yeah
[10:55:32] <sham1> The only thing will be that it won't look quite as neat as the two column PDF, and that just won't do!
[10:55:48] <amazigh> I do not like two column pdf :)
[10:55:59] <amazigh> also maybe it is possible to config that in pandoc
[10:56:08] <sham1> Yes
[10:58:58] <s-liao> But he said that pandoc  has serious issues with some sections.
[10:59:23] <sham1> But that's probably only with regards to going from LaTeX sections to HTML
[10:59:37] <sham1> Meanwhile, I don't see why Pandoc's markdown dialect would have the same problem
[11:00:36] <s-liao> Markdown is not LaTeX.
[11:03:15] <s-liao> Markdown just simplify like what we have in email in the old days.
[11:05:07] <s-liao> I mean that it does not the complete grammar system to rule it.
[11:09:29] *** Quits: s-liao (~s-liao@101.86.96.21) (Quit: Client closed)
[11:13:30] <dpk> i think Scribble or similar would be a better choice than Markdown
[11:14:37] <dpk> since it can turn things into HTML or PDF and we can define the structural elements we need
[11:14:49] <dpk> or texinfo, or DocBook even, or whatever
[11:15:17] <sham1> Yeah. Perhaps AsciiDoc. The benefit of Markdown would be the relative ease of usage, although things like AsciiDoc and RST also have that

[11:43:11] <amazigh> markdown does not look *impressive* according to *some* standard but it is mainstream and get the job done, with the help of pandoc, and possibly github flavored markdown we can translate it to avoid formats, including tex and html. I already expressed my concerns about markdown here.
[11:43:44] <amazigh> Markdown is supported by most software forges.
[11:44:05] *** Quits: karlosz (~karlosz@136.56.98.53) (Quit: karlosz)
[11:44:07] <amazigh> Maybe later we can switch to scribble / skribbilo (prefered by me) 
[11:44:50] <amazigh> the problem with skribe / skribbilo is that there is no support for it in emacs, no coloration, no indentation, which is a pain
[11:45:02] <sham1> I mean, one could also begin with AsciiDoc at the beginning and then maybe switch to Scribble
[11:45:17] <amazigh> pandor flavored markdown is very impressive
[11:45:25] <amazigh> asciidoc is supported by pandoc?
[11:45:38] <sham1> Yes
[11:45:40] <amazigh> what is the advantage of asciidoc?
[11:46:07] <amazigh> does it support footnotes, and inline math, and math blocks?
[11:46:12] <sham1> Well it has more of an actual spec than Markdown (although CommonMark does fix that) and it's more expressive in more areas
[11:47:02] <sham1> Technically AsciiDoc doesn't have inline maths by default, since it's like a Ascii version of Docbook, but you can certainly do either inline LaTeX or AsciiMath
[11:47:21] * amazigh shruggs
[11:51:52] <sham1> Although, is the scribble format actually specified by Racket anywhere in the documentation
