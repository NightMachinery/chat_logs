[08:58:21] <rgrinberg> hackinghorn if you're using base, you should write if String.equal "a" "b" then ...

[09:01:35] <rgrinberg> the latter
[09:01:40] <hackinghorn> ahh thankss

[09:02:56] <rgrinberg> Yes, it is a bit unconventional.
[09:03:26] <rgrinberg> Still, I'm pretty sure other languages like basic or pascal have the same convention. So it's not unheard of

[10:56:35] <vsiles> why do you say this ?
[11:06:02] <d_bot> <Splingush> If you are using it like `float -1`, you either need parenthesis `float (-1)` or use the unary symbol `float ~-1` due to confusion with the binary operator `-`

[13:10:04] <d_bot> <NULL> Well in the base case, - is a binary operator expecting 2 ints, and you are giving it `f str` and `1` as arguments, so it complains that `f str` is not an int. What was the problem with `f str (-1)`

[21:27:56] <d_bot> <froyo> it probably isn't a serious barrier if they use the component-writing style in their assignments... write a function and have it pass all tests.. If they do hackerrank-style assignments where they receive their values via IO and print their results out, or if they use Haskell in writing conventional imperative algorithms, they have to deal with the IO monad and IORef stuff right off the bad, which is a thick topic for an absolute b

[23:15:40] <d_bot> <salt rock lamp> i think there's some merit to it, if they're an absolute beginner, they're just following patterns blindly anyway
[23:16:16] <d_bot> <salt rock lamp> by the time they know any better, they won't be a beginner anymore
[23:16:39] <d_bot> <salt rock lamp> it's like how babies can learn arbitrarily complicated languages, but for adults some languages can be harder to learn than others

[23:36:57] <d_bot> <froyo> that's a super interesting way to look at it actually 👀
[23:38:09] <olle> Baby brains are special :)
[23:39:18] <d_bot> <froyo> tru
[23:39:48] <d_bot> <froyo> i wonder if we keep some of our baby-brain abilities for completely foreign skills
[23:40:22] <companion_cube> oriba: not that I know of
[23:46:22] <olle> froyo, baby brains lose a shitload of neurons at a certain age, some kind of cunning
[23:48:08] <companion_cube> a lot of synapses, I think? not full neurons?
[23:48:20] <olle> wrong word (cunning)
[23:48:25] <olle> companion_cube: oh, idk
[23:48:28] <olle> maybe you're right
[23:48:31] <companion_cube> "synaptic pruning"
[23:48:54] <olle> right
[23:50:26] <olle> anyway - changeability predictors!
[23:50:32] <olle> you want em, I got em :)
[23:52:05] <olle> Or not!
[23:52:05] <olle> "Our results suggest that there is little
[23:52:05] <olle> evidence on the effectiveness of software
[23:52:06] <olle> maintainability prediction techniques and models."
[23:52:34] <olle> I can't write a blog post on that :(
[23:52:57] <olle> Negative results gather no moss, nor Facebook likes
[23:57:58] <companion_cube> blog posts is exactly where it's fine to publish negative results though?
[23:57:59] <Armael> pretty sure that doing research is not the most efficient way of getting facebook likes
[23:58:14] <companion_cube> unless your tenure track forces you to have a high p-index
[23:58:19] <companion_cube> (p for blogpost lol)
[23:59:46] <olle> what's p-index?
[23:59:56] <companion_cube> a stupid joke wrt h-index
