[00:25:32] <A-KO> lol
[00:25:44] <A-KO> not using SQL is still very much a thing.
[00:26:01] <A-KO> even though tools like MSSQL provide a fuckton of actual, decent data protection, compliance, etc.
[00:26:03] <evilgohan2> Yes, but the cargo cult that emerged around it was... problematic to say the least
[00:26:25] <A-KO> developers were all like "ENCRYPTION AND DATA PROTECTION? WHAT'S THAT?"
[00:26:27] <A-KO> "WE DON'T NEED THAT"
[00:26:30] <evilgohan2> I watched an entire application burn to the ground because people tried to shove a relational model into an object database.
[00:26:38] <A-KO> lol
[00:26:45] <evilgohan2> 2 years of development wasted
[00:26:55] <A-KO> it happens
[00:27:02] <evilgohan2> True, but it was avoidable

[00:29:06] <evilgohan2> Oh, don't rely on Red Hat for good documentation either.
[00:29:15] <evilgohan2> Their documentation for using winbind is actually... not entirely correct.

[00:29:39] <sd_> 09<h​ayden> Well, a lot of the systems I manage are CentOS (soon Rocky Linux), so most of their documentation for EL8 is perfectly fine for my needs, if they have documentation for what I'm looking for

[00:30:46] <evilgohan2> o_O

[00:32:15] <evilgohan2> Trying to clean that up.
[00:32:16] <sd_> 09<h​ayden> Because surely things like HBAC and central Sudo rules are kinda hard to implement in AD?
[00:32:20] <A-KO> As far as I know our linux team is planning on ditching AD
[00:32:22] <evilgohan2> not really.
[00:32:30] <A-KO> which is just dumb lol
[00:32:37] <A-KO> because they'll inevitably build "their own" system
[00:32:42] <evilgohan2> domain groups which should have access to sudo can be defined in the sudoers file or sudoers.d
[00:32:55] <evilgohan2> and domain groups which should be able to login can be defined in winbind's config.
[00:33:02] <evilgohan2> It's actually _really_ straightforward
[00:33:05] <sd_> 09<h​ayden> Well, I'm in the process of rolling out FreeIPA to some servers over a VPN, and then I'll put Keycloak in place on top of it for OIDC support
[00:33:16] <A-KO> Here's the thing, and I tell this to everyone: The problems that you find with "AD" and "Windows", are inherent problems to the fundamental basis of what it's accomplishing. You will have the exact problems with any other solutoin, except maybe a little worse.
[00:33:17] <sd_> 09<h​ayden> Yeah, but that's not _central_
[00:33:49] <evilgohan2> and Linux is at least respectful of AD domains, groups, and users.
[00:33:58] <A-KO> speaking of AD, I need to log in and write some DSC code today

[01:15:10] <Hunterkll> jimender2: yea what's up?
[01:15:13] <jimender2> I have a computer that I have git installed on.  The Base OS does not have internet access (due to proxy settings) but chrome has full access.  Is there a way to redirect my git install to use the chrome connection for pushes and pulls
[01:15:18] <DrZak> :))
[01:15:36] <DrZak> chrome-tunnel? :)
[01:16:03] <Hunterkll> I'm not even going to entertain something that stupid
[01:16:08] <DrZak> ye
[01:16:10] <jimender2> Essentially create a chrome tunnel.  Is that a real thing though DrZak
[01:16:16] <DrZak> no
[01:16:18] <xe0n> loll
[01:16:38] <DrZak> does the proxy check the client string?
[01:16:51] <DrZak> or why wouldnt git be able to connect to the same proxy chrome is using?
[01:16:52] <jimender2> There are so many stupid chrome extensions names I didnt know.

[01:17:27] <SuperQ> Yup
[01:17:30] <jimender2> They pushed some certs out using chrome manager or something
[01:17:45] <SuperQ> Probably a proxy config.
[01:17:53] <SuperQ> Just use that for git over https.
[01:18:08] <DrZak> wpad / pac files
[01:18:20] <SuperQ> And use an oath2 token for git security
[01:18:42] <SuperQ> In .gitconfig:
[01:18:44] <SuperQ> [credential]
[01:18:46] <SuperQ>  helper = store --file ~/.git-auth
[01:18:52] <jimender2> How can I get the proxy config out of chrome then?
[01:19:13] <SuperQ> In .git-auth: https://oauth2:SECRET@github.com
[01:19:19] <DrZak> anyways, better be above board with source security, unless you wanna some very angry man storm your place being very cross with you
[01:19:21] <SuperQ> Good question
[01:20:38] <jimender2> Our git repos are so convulted.  We are storing binary files in the git repo.  We also have git lab organizations set up for each customer with sub orgs for each site of theres.

[06:41:02] <yuken> csws, I actually have an out of state conceal carry license, which is... legal and valid for me. Although it's never been tested in court by someone <21...
[06:41:21] <yuken> so while I am confident it's legal, I sure hope I don't ever get pulled over until my 21st birthday lul
[06:41:36] <xe0n> its sad you feel you have to carry a gun lol

He has been supplied with a domain joined laptop, configured with a VPN connection to our site. He is not able to connect to network shares, he is given an error indicating he does not have permissions, is there some special permission required to access shares over VPN? Having difficulty finding anything concrete online for it

[12:48:19] <sd> 14<K​aligraphic> Would his account have permissions if he was on site?
[12:48:42] <Oliber> sounds like permissions are wrong on the share or file system; also you shhould not logon to do your day to day work as a domain admin
[12:49:01] <aab_> just check the share see who has permissions

[12:51:59] <sd> 14<X​eLaD> Also worth mentioning i specifically added Shortcuts to the shares on his desktop using the IP and not the FQDN

[14:00:46] <sd> 05<N​ick1296> Is reinstalling sound too drastic seeing as I reset the BIOS, disabled the audio chip and re-enabled, reinstalled the driver 6 times and nothing else worked?
[14:02:21] <TechSmurf> No, it really doesn't, but I'll usually bet there was a simpler, stupider answer... but if you've already been at it for 4 hours and it doesn't cause a huge upset to reinstall, I'd cosider it myself.
[14:03:19] <TechSmurf> The interesting question is whether or not the nuclear option is enough to fix it ;)
[14:04:41] <TechSmurf> Does the system have a headset jack? Have you tested it with headphones? Did something go really sideways convincing the soundcard that headphones were plugged in when they really aren't, and so it's disabling output to the speakers? This would likely survive reinstall.

[23:08:36] <signofzeta> iMessage is indeed encrypted end-to-end, but Apple manages the keys for you.  They could slip an extra key into the exchange.

[23:31:05] <naplifye> hi, can someone help me? I have a Windows VM with unifi, how do I change net settings so it can see my hardware?
[23:31:17] <ThatOneRoadie> I think it's just 'sh arp | i macad-dress'
[23:31:25] <estranger> then continue to work with them as they grow/expand use cases

[23:31:48] <teh_f4ll3n> naplifye, what?
[23:31:55] <iphone> I've only touched switches, never configured them. That shit is voodo

[23:32:01] <layer8> iphone meant: "I've only touched switches, never configured them. That shit is voodoo"
[23:32:04] <int0x1C8> unifi... on windows...
[23:32:12] <int0x1C8> ..but why
[23:32:23] <teh_f4ll3n> int0x1C8, yeah, the controller runs on java

[23:33:12] <naplifye> So I have unifi-controller on windows VM, atm it does not see my hardware (AP , switch etc) To what do I change network settings (NAT etc) I am using virtmanager on Linux 
[23:33:15] <int0x1C8> there's a single run install script for most common linux distros that a forum guy wrote

[23:33:54] <iphone> :surprise_pikachu_face:
[23:33:57] <int0x1C8> uh, if your windows VM is on the same network as the hardware, it should see them
[23:34:06] <teh_f4ll3n> naplifye, we can't answer that  without knowing your network setup

[23:34:42] <DoTheNeedful> It's Always DNS.
[23:34:44] <naplifye> teh_f4ll3n, what info do you need?
[23:34:45] <estranger> set option 43 in your dhcp
[23:34:58] <estranger> or configure each thinggy manually with your controller IP
[23:35:08] <estranger> https://help.ui.com/hc/en-us/articles/360012097513-UniFi-UDM-USG-How-to-Configure-Custom-DHCP-Options
[23:35:13] <int0x1C8> is the VM and the hardware it needs to manage on the same LAN?
[23:35:41] <naplifye> yes, they are 
[23:35:49] <JollyRgrs> wait what? you are using linux as a KVM host... but running unifi controller in a windows VM?
[23:36:07] <teh_f4ll3n> can you ping the AP from your windows VM?
[23:36:07] <naplifye> yes, just for the test, because I had the same issue as I have atm on debian
[23:36:16] <naplifye> and I need a windows VM so ... yeah
[23:36:21] <JollyRgrs> have you tried just disabling the entire windows firewall? note you can't just "stop the service" or else (afaik) it just keeps blocks in place
[23:36:23] <estranger> just setup your DHCP w/ option 43 to your controller
[23:36:25] <teh_f4ll3n> JollyRgrs, eh, I've seen worse
[23:36:35] <JollyRgrs> what is handling dhcp/dns?
[23:36:56] <naplifye> I can ping my gateway/router from my WIndows VM 
[23:37:05] <estranger> that dont mean shit
[23:37:05] <naplifye> I have no idea what is the address for the switch :D
[23:37:11] <JollyRgrs> i run unifi controller (debian) in a VM, never had to do anything to make that work
[23:37:28] <int0x1C8> I run mine on ubuntu, same
[23:37:28] <naplifye> JollyRgrs so NAT as network?
[23:37:53] <JollyRgrs> you mean for the VM?
[23:37:53] <int0x1C8> NAT is only a consideration if you're not on the same LAN
[23:37:55] <naplifye> yes
[23:37:59] <JollyRgrs> no?
[23:38:11] <naplifye> what is the name then? I have 0 network experience
[23:38:11] <JollyRgrs> having NAT inside a VM is like double-NAT
[23:38:22] <JollyRgrs> then you shouldn't be configuring this
[23:38:27] <naplifye> why not? 
[23:38:29] <JollyRgrs> contract
[23:38:30] <naplifye> how will I learn?
[23:38:32] <int0x1C8> name of what?
[23:38:41] <naplifye> if its is not NAT what is it then
[23:38:48] <naplifye> I am using virt-manager
[23:38:55] <int0x1C8> NAT == "network address translation"
[23:38:59] <iphone> more nat is better
[23:38:59] <JollyRgrs> if you don't know 101 of how to setup a VM's networking, you need to learn that before trying to play with the unifi controller
[23:39:12] <JollyRgrs> virt-manager is just a GUI for KVM/Qemu
[23:39:18] <int0x1C8> it's a protocol that exists _between_ networks, not within them
[23:39:19] <naplifye> indeed
[23:39:22] <naplifye> and I need help for the gui
[23:39:24] <naplifye> smart ass
[23:39:37] <estranger> it should auto discover if on  the same subnet
[23:39:46] <iphone> your isp probably does NAT on your router's outgoing line, and your router does nat on your home network, and the vm does nat too, so why can't you do nat within nat here?
[23:39:48] <naplifye> well by default its on NAT
[23:39:55] <estranger> if not you need to tell the devices how to reach the controller and you need to make sure you have a network path that works
[23:40:18] <estranger> if your VM is NATd its not going to work.. set it to bridge 
[23:40:20] <PrincessZoey> Ugh October is gunna be busy for me
[23:40:22] <JollyRgrs> naplifye: so what IP is your VM for the controller getting?
[23:40:28] <JollyRgrs> and what IP space is the rest of your junk on?
[23:40:33] <MikeSpears> PrincessZoey good busy?
[23:40:38] <iphone> Make sure the MTU is set to 1500
[23:40:39] <PrincessZoey> Two spacex launches and a rocket lab launch in Virginia
[23:40:45] <MikeSpears> ah
[23:40:46] <JollyRgrs> bridge should always be how you set up VMs if you want to just emulate bare-metal
[23:40:49] <estranger> rocketlab is launching again already? sweet!
[23:40:54] <estranger> felt bad for them

[23:41:59] <teh_f4ll3n> just SSH into the AP and set 'inform' manually. if that fails, it's your network setup
[23:42:05] <naplifye> well as I said I have no  experience, so best I could explain is that. My router dhcp gives me 192.168.1.X and my virt-manager dhcp gives 192.168.100.X

[23:42:38] <JollyRgrs> MikeSpears: yeah, but like... the ones i have are fine for now, so i'd need a REALLY sweet deal before moving on... like <$100 for replacing all 3 boxes
[23:42:39] <PrincessZoey> And If I need to figure out where a sound is coming from forget it
[23:42:39] <MikeSpears> I thought you lost that when your ear drum ruptured last year lmao
[23:42:40] <estranger> naplifye, need to change your VM to be bridged not NAT.. dunno how, i dont use that stuff
[23:42:54] <MikeSpears> did that ever heal properly?
[23:43:05] <PrincessZoey> Um no
[23:43:08] <MikeSpears> RIP
[23:43:09] <int0x1C8> the windows VM should have a static IP anyway
[23:43:11] <JollyRgrs> estranger: it's just in the network config somewhere, should be a radio button or something i think
[23:43:24] <JollyRgrs> i set my statics via DHCP as much as possible
[23:43:33] <JollyRgrs> saves me from having to configure each and every server if I change something
[23:43:51] <JollyRgrs> also, it makes a nice handy reference to know what's been assigned what
[23:44:04] <int0x1C8> wat
[23:44:11] <estranger> jah
[23:44:16] <int0x1C8> am I high?
[23:44:21] <estranger> maybe
[23:44:28] <JollyRgrs> int0x1C8: how many fingers am i holding up?
[23:44:35] <estranger> locking down IPs via dhcp is common 
[23:44:37] <JollyRgrs> int0x1C8: were you going to go to class?
[23:44:40] <int0x1C8> how tf do you do static over dhcp, they're mutually exclusive
[23:44:47] <teh_f4ll3n> that's why I run Unifi controller in a container on a linux VM and just forward the ports
[23:44:49] <estranger> calling it "static" is a bit confusing
[23:44:54] <estranger> but you can say this mac is always this IP
[23:44:58] <JollyRgrs> int0x1C8: were you going to clean your room, but then didn't?
[23:45:12] <JollyRgrs> it's dhcp reservations
[23:45:13] <teh_f4ll3n> but then he got high
[23:45:21] <int0x1C8> oh just reservations
[23:45:27] <JollyRgrs> but it's basically "config management" of static IPs
[23:45:47] <teh_f4ll3n> DHCP reservations are tight
[23:45:53] <iphone> anyone else like DNS?
[23:45:56] <estranger> reservation thats the word
