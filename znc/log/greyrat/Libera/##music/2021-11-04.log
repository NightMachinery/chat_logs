That work began in July and August 1950, in Tokyo and at the Hakone Convention Center,[9] when Deming delivered speeches on what he called "Statistical Product Quality Administration". Many in Japan credit Deming as one of the inspirations for what has become known as the Japanese

[22:43:14] <golrom> no
[22:44:24] <golrom> if you pinch the outside edge of the seam where the lid is put on all the way around the can it will loosen it up and you can just pull it off
