[16:45:30] <digitok> nope
[16:45:36] <digitok> are you using .NET?
[16:46:16] <purplex> yes a two regexes solution
[16:48:36] <purplex> will you have a lot of entries like these?
[16:49:47] <purplex> {Name1 Comp1 Comp2 Comp2} {Name2 Comp1 Comp2 Comp3} .. so on
[16:51:27] *** Quits: jle (~jle@aftr-88-152-185-251.unity-media.net) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[16:52:04] <Seb47> humm not exactly like this, more like this NameAssembly1, Comp1, Sign2, Comp2, sign3, Comp3, .... so on
[16:52:57] <purplex> then you can have that many matches, but not group unless you use .net..
[16:53:47] <purplex> A \G solution seems applicable
[16:53:50] <Seb47> ok I never used .net
[16:57:38] <Seb47> Is it possible to update my regex with an example ?
[17:00:28] <purplex> yes after modifying, press ctrl+shift+s you'll get a new link
[17:03:32] <digitok> i think he meant you :p

[17:04:41] <purplex> ah i see :p i thought you were cooking but ok let's see
[17:05:04] <digitok> haha
[17:06:19] <purplex> https://regex101.com/r/hFPsn7/2 last one is missing a sign
[17:06:24] <digitok> it'd be something like https://regex101.com/r/hFPsn7/3
[17:06:38] <digitok> oh, i was doing .net hehe
[17:07:33] <Seb47> :-D  yes thanks, sorry I'm very new on regex and it's difficult for me to understand the example in the help.
[17:08:52] <Seb47> Ok so I will try to understand your two example. Thank you
[17:11:54] <purplex> in case you want last one regardless of sign: https://regex101.com/r/hFPsn7/4
[17:19:17] *** Quits: re101-yorkie-5 (~re101-yor@202.168.85.189) (Quit: Client closed)
[17:23:55] <Seb47> Well I think that the best one is the number 4 because it consider unlimited number of comp. The only thing that I need to solve is to get the sign before the word, like comp1, sign2, comp2, sign3, comp3 and so on
[17:26:28] <purplex> get the sign? https://regex101.com/r/hFPsn7/5
[17:29:07] <purplex> then you'll want the word too: https://regex101.com/r/hFPsn7/6
[17:31:21] <Seb47> yes perfect like this. you are working too fast for me :-D

[17:33:46] *** Joins: jimbocz (~jimbocz@80.194.76.226)
[17:35:35] <purplex> something else i tried https://regex101.com/r/hFPsn7/8
[17:35:53] <purplex> if you really meant sign before or after
[17:37:28] <Seb47> thank but this will never happend (the comp1 will never have sign before and other will always have sign)
[17:37:49] <digitok> i'd probably do https://regex101.com/r/hFPsn7/9
[17:39:08] <purplex> ok but in "comp1, sign2, comp2, sign3, comp3" sign2 seems to be attached to comp2 i.e. before it
[17:39:56] <digitok> yep
[17:40:24] <Seb47> yes the number 9 is perfect I try to import it in my python code
[17:40:41] <digitok> you'll need 'regex' module
[17:42:17] <purplex> yep when i said import regex! the other day lopid was like /ignore purplex lol
[17:42:24] <digitok> personally, i'd prefer 2 regex
[17:44:28] <purplex> a 2 regex i see, but there is only single name in front?
[17:44:56] <digitok> yep
[17:45:17] <digitok> /9 means you get match 1 with the name and the first comp, followed by N matches with a sign and a comp
[17:45:42] <digitok> 2 regex means you get a match with the name and all comps, and then you simply do another regex to get each sign and comp
[17:46:25] <digitok> https://regex101.com/r/hFPsn7/10 and https://regex101.com/r/hFPsn7/11
[17:46:48] <digitok> it'll also work with 're' module
[17:47:28] <purplex> ah 're' okay.. yeah but since groups (+) and (comp) are attached to match and there's only single name to worry about, 1 regex is still okay (with regex module)
[17:47:34] *** Quits: cthulchu_ (~Cthulchu@193.194.107.250) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[17:48:10] <digitok> i still prefer this way
[17:48:11] <digitok> :)
[17:48:13] <purplex> but 2 regex is more simple and clean job
[17:48:40] <digitok> if he wanted the sign as its own match, the 2nd regex could be simplified to just \S+
[17:49:06] <Seb47> Hummm newby doesn't understand expert :-D
[17:49:24] <digitok> or re.split with \s+
[17:49:27] <digitok> Seb47
[17:49:40] <Seb47> why \9 wasn't good ?
[17:50:27] <digitok> given  "a + b + c"  would you prefer  [a], [+,b], [+,c]  or  [a], [+], [b], [+], [c]  ?
[17:50:29] <purplex> it works, but /10 and /11 are more clean, simple, and work with python's 're' module
[17:50:34] <digitok> where [] is a match
[17:51:20] <Seb47> I prefer [a], [+,b], [+,c]
[17:51:24] <digitok> ok
[17:51:40] <digitok> then yea, i'd recommend /10 and /11
[17:51:47] <digitok> where /11 is applied to group 2 from /10
[17:52:09] <digitok> i forgot to name group 2, but you could name it Comps or such
[17:52:42] <purplex> in case you are new to regexes and python, you can still use /9 if you can't get /10 and /11 to work
[17:53:07] <digitok> if he can get /9 to work he should be able to get /10 and /11 to work :p
[17:53:20] <purplex> just a little twist :p
[17:53:31] <purplex> but yea i'm joking
[17:53:48] <digitok> lol
[17:53:51] <purplex> since regex101 won't have its code
[17:57:26] <digitok> nah, it's pretty straightforward though
[17:58:38] <purplex> Seb47: you can show me the code if you can't get it to work
[18:01:03] <Seb47> OK so give me time to work on it and find the best way. I will send you messages in case that I need help.

[19:38:05] <dka> digitok, I need the same regex, but reverse
[19:38:48] <dka> I don't want (/__specs__/(test|spec)).(native|ios|android).tsx? but I want  .test(.web).tsx?
[19:39:43] <dka> Something like : https://regex101.com/r/wFw2pi/1 
[19:39:47] <dka> but I need to include .web.
[19:40:14] <dka> https://regex101.com/r/aJ2Nej/1\
[19:40:18] <dka> This seems to be it : https://regex101.com/r/aJ2Nej/1
[19:44:12] <NiLon> you can just press update too
[19:44:46] <dka> it'
[19:44:51] <dka> it's faster to CTRL+S
[19:46:03] <NiLon> you might also want \.web
