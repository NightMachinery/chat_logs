[01:19:50] <printf> bookworm does miniflux autodelete old articles
[01:21:08] <bookworm> CLEANUP_ARCHIVE_UNREAD_DAYS
[01:21:09] <bookworm> yes
[01:21:57] <printf> ok i did set the environment variable: CLEANUP_ARCHIVE_UNREAD_DAYS to 7
[01:22:16] <printf> but do i still need to manually go into postgres and run VACUUM
[01:23:31] <bookworm> I don't think so no
[01:23:40] <bookworm> then again, I'm not so low that I care
[01:23:57] <printf> lol 
[01:23:58] <bookworm> It will simply re-use the space for other articles so that's fine for me, even if there's no vacuum
[01:24:11] <printf> nice
[01:24:11] <bookworm> although I guess they do that already, check the code
[01:25:04] <printf> im asking cuz on the FAQ page https://miniflux.app/faq.html , it states that "Keep in mind that Postgres needs to run the VACUUM command to reclaim disk space."
[01:25:34] <printf> but i gave my postgres 4Gb of storage
[01:25:37] <printf> so i think it's fine
[01:25:47] <printf> probably enough 
[01:26:24] <bookworm> k, then they doz
[01:26:45] <bookworm> but as said, it'll reuse the space fir other articles
[01:26:54] <bookworm> so, fine for me
[01:27:02] <printf> how much storage u gave your database
[01:27:08] <bookworm> unlimited
[01:27:20] <printf> oh , well do u think 4Gb is enough
[01:27:31] <printf> im not quite sure how much i should give it, 
[01:27:33] <bookworm> why limit it?
[01:27:50] <bookworm> just give it a directory and let it use what it needs
[01:28:26] <printf> im deploying it on k8s with persistent storage
[01:28:28] <bookworm> aren't you the person with like a TB of storage?
[01:29:15] <printf> im on k8s, and i need to specify the PVC size for postgres
[01:29:16] <bookworm> k8s seems over engineered... learning?
[01:29:30] <printf> im using my SSD for longhorn 
[01:29:41] <bookworm> whatever that is
[01:30:08] <bookworm> as always, depends on your usage
[01:30:23] <bookworm> single user? 20ish feeds? 100 users, 1k feeds?
[01:30:35] <bookworm> different storage usage
[01:30:38] <printf> but the thing is, i kinda have an idea how much thelounge needs, 1G is probably very generous amount, but for minflux im not sure
[01:30:52] <printf> i think im gonna run it for a week and see
[01:30:54] <bookworm> 1GB is probably 3 months, not even
[01:30:57] <bookworm> for TL
[01:31:10] <bookworm> least if you are in Linux and libera
[01:31:24] <bookworm> or some fucked up chan lile news
[01:31:54] <printf> im keeping  number of IRC channels joined low right ow
[01:32:03] <printf> im only joining 4 channels
[01:32:12] <printf> ##rust, #go-nuts, #thelounge and this one
[01:33:15] <printf> oh btw do u know if it's possible to have miniflux homepage display both read and unread , 
[01:34:06] <printf> i understand that most RSS hides read articles, and i see that u can go into the "History" tab to see read stuff,
[01:34:19] <printf> but it would be better if thers like a toggle
[01:34:49] <bookworm> mkey, my feef DB is around 215mb
[01:34:59] <bookworm> and that's with 50 feeds
[01:35:36] <printf> i only have 7 feeds right now, havent added a lot
[01:36:10] <bookworm> as for the unread stuff, you'd need to go to the individual feed pages to do that
[01:36:32] <bookworm> the unread section really is for unread stuff
[01:37:39] <printf> nice
[01:38:42] <printf> what does the "Fetch Oringal Content" thing do, i tried switching it on and off, the result is the same
[01:38:54] <printf> images, text, everything seems the same
[01:42:01] <bookworm> only for well behaved feeds :)
[01:42:37] <bookworm> it fetches the html and tries to extract the actual content via some configurable css selectors
[01:42:43] <bookworm> for those a n
[01:43:10] <printf> hey i really like these modern webapps, what  other stuff do u selfhost
[01:43:14] <bookworm> annoying people who only put the title plus the first sentence vin the feed*
[01:43:29] <printf> bookworm,do you turn it on
[01:43:37] <printf> the "Fetch Oringal Content"
[01:43:44] <bookworm> for those feeds where I have to
[01:44:06] <bookworm> if you get the full content in the feed  don't
[01:44:29] <bookworm> not much else, znc and that's about it
[01:44:39] <bookworm> tried matrix but it's a pain
[01:44:55] <bookworm> oh and pleroma (fediverse)
[01:45:11] <bookworm> aaaand a mail server
[01:45:37] <printf> Never used znc before ,is it like an IRC bouncer ?
[01:45:46] <bookworm> yes
[01:47:46] <printf> Well I guess I don't really need a bouncer if I'm using TL 
[01:49:28] <bookworm> you get some added features, but sure TL can do a lot of the typical usecases
[01:49:48] <bookworm> I use TL like any other client, so I connect to znc
[01:50:15] <bookworm> that has the added benefit that I can still use other clients using the same nick
[01:50:36] <bookworm> plus the ability to detach channels and some such
[01:51:11] <printf> Ah right ,so I can use weechat in the terminal while still keeping the same nick 
[01:51:19] <bookworm> but it's mostly a historical artifact, I already had znc up and running when I started using TL
[01:51:22] <bookworm> yes
[01:51:40] <printf> Yea I just created a new account for using in weechat 
[01:51:54] <printf> Guess I can look into znc 
[01:51:55] <bookworm> yeah that's a horrible UX
[01:51:59] <printf> So I don't have to 
[01:52:19] <bookworm> confusing for yourself and others if you flip accounts in between a conversation
[01:52:27] <printf> I didn't know how znc works so I just created new account for each platform lol
[01:52:49] <bookworm> yeah ORC isn't exactly newbie friendly, been there
[01:52:52] <bookworm> IRC*
[01:53:53] <printf> I used to have 1 acc for mobile (revolution IRC ) ,one for weechat and then one for hexchat
[01:54:07] <printf> Now I use TL both mobile and desktop
[01:54:17] <bookworm> ... you really didn't get the memo with a bouncer did you XD
[01:54:23] <printf> In the terminal I'm still using weechat lol ,
[01:54:35] <printf> Yea I think I heard about it somewhere
[01:54:40] <printf> But never looked into it
[01:55:03] <bookworm> weechat is much nicer on the desktop yes, what made me switch to TL on all devices is the fact that you get your read state synced
[01:55:20] <bookworm> and *that's* one nice feature right there
[01:55:43] <printf> Yea I like that too
[01:56:01] <bookworm> heck, I tried the weechat over ssh on mobile thing but without a keyboard it's barely usabz
[01:56:10] <bookworm> usable*
[01:56:31] <bookworm> ^ see exactly due to that. My typing on a phone is, ehm, awesome... or something
[01:57:22] <printf> Weechat is the best IRC for terminal ,but any other platform I would use TL 
[01:57:49] <bookworm> indeed. on the plus side I can now only waste my worktime o n IRC :P
[01:57:58] <bookworm> s/only/also
[01:58:27] <bookworm> which I couldn't do without the web irc client
[01:58:40] <printf> I've never used weechat on mobile , I've only tried revolution IRC cuz it's the only good IRC client on Android 
[01:58:56] <bookworm> it's a fucking mess
[01:59:03] <bookworm> nothing about it is good
[01:59:15] <printf> There really aren't any alternative lol
[01:59:21] <bookworm> it fell over with a low number of backlog and had bugs all over the place
[01:59:35] <printf> I can't find good native android IRC apps 
[01:59:41] <bookworm> plus the persistent notification and similar things
[01:59:58] <bookworm> well, I did... TL is approximately native on Android
[02:00:15] <printf> I mean Revolution isn't great, but I can't find any other better options lol
[02:00:33] <printf> Yea TL is Great,I've installed it PWA and using it 
[02:00:52] <printf> I can finally uninstall revolution IRC 
[02:01:09] <bookworm> I still have it installed, I just don't use it anymore
[02:01:37] <printf> You're right , TL pwa pretty much behaves like any other native apps 
[02:01:37] <bookworm> tried about every IRC client including glowing bear (the weechat client)
[02:03:00] <printf> I googled the best IRC clients, the best Android app is revolution, best desktop app is hexchat and best terminal app is weechat
[02:04:04] <printf> But now that there's TL,I see more and more ppl using TL instead of the old weechat/irssi clients
[02:04:14] <bookworm> best is always subjective
[02:04:36] <printf> Well, one of the most popular
[02:05:00] <bookworm> there's gamja too if you like minimal stuff, although that's designed to be bundled with soyu (a bouncer)
[02:05:54] <bookworm> I'm personally very fond of TL as you might be able to tell ;P
[02:07:01] <printf> Lol yes
[02:07:26] <printf> I personally really like the modern interface of TL
[02:09:47] <printf> Most of the clients are very old, the UI looks like there are still stuck in the early 2000s
[02:20:54] * bookworm looks at his desktop
[02:20:57] <bookworm> well...
[02:21:33] <bookworm> not exactly modern but I like how it looks
[02:22:00] <bookworm> gruvbox everywhere and barely and window decorations
[02:22:07] <bookworm> any*
[02:22:23] <bookworm> but calling that modern is a stretch

[09:32:31] <printf> for some reason the miniflux pwa installed on my desktop keeps loggiing out every few minutes lol
[09:56:22] <bookworm> few minutes is a bit annoying is it? ;P
[09:56:39] <bookworm> but yes it logs you out from time to time
[10:00:15] <bookworm> did you set CLEANUP_REMOVE_SESSIONS_DAYS to some nonsense value?
[10:00:37] <bookworm> as in in a float or what have you?
[10:09:25] <printf> oh turns out it's my browser extension, cookies autodelete
[10:09:53] <printf> added miniflux to whitelist and seems like it's not logging out again
[10:17:31] <bookworm> XD

[19:47:27] <xnaas> I tried miniflux once. I wanted to like it...but it never updated any RSS feeds no matter what. Was kinda wild. 
[19:47:55] <xnaas> Coulda just been a bugged release, dunno, haven't bothered trying again yet as FreshRSS has been working fine. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[19:48:45] <bookworm> works fine for me 🤷‍♂️

[20:58:35] <AKTheKnight> Probably gonna get shamed for this, but I just use outlook as my rss feed reader :)
[21:25:29] <xnaas> I'm more...intrigued than disgusted. 
[21:25:31] <xnaas> ;P
[21:28:26] <AKTheKnight> Currently I only really watch rss feeds related to work (Azure outages and new features), so it's all just in my work outlook where I can see it when needed
[22:25:25] <printf> is it weird if ive set the environment variable POLLING_FREQUENCY to "15" and none of feeds have been updated for 20 minutes
[22:25:56] <printf> all of my feeds: last check: 20 minutes
[23:10:15] <bookworm> feeds have a lifetime where server tell well behaving clients to not poll more often than X, might be that
