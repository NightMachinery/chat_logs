[05:24:49] <audrey> For the purposes of this channel, it's not appropriate.
[05:25:32] <audrey> Also, let's try not to ridicule fatness here. I'm trying to have a conversation about how fat studies fits into the broader academic picture and literature. Maybe that's too much to ask, for this channel. :|
[05:25:33] <Parf> they fit in from the perspective of demoralization
[05:25:42] <audrey> Knowing this channel, it probably is. sigh.
[05:25:53] <Parf> morgante is literally a literary figure
[05:25:55] <Parf> italian
[05:26:06] <audrey> You know what, I give up. Whatever. :|
[05:26:28] <Parf> luigi pulcci i believe wrote this enormous epic poem about him, and fighting saracens and shit
[05:27:30] <Parf> seriously though, demoralization. if you stop and consider it from a demoralizing process, all the studies and the funding for these studies starts to come into view more than just a group of fat people trying to defend their fatness. though it could just appear to be a large organism when in reality it's many disparate fields of study that resemble a group
[05:28:06] <audrey> Seems like the only conversation possible about these topics is either pro-oppression-paradigm defensiveness, or reactionary ridicule.
[05:29:13] <Parf> where under that does the sum of my comments before you even stepped in total either one of those poles
[05:29:45] <audrey> I'm speaking generally, not just to you, Parf
[05:30:09] <Parf> oh, ok, i'm glad to hear that, because overall i feel i agree with what you've said
[05:32:38] <Parf> would you prefer fat studies to have a consolidation, though? or would you rather it disperse entirely. i think obesity should be studied from a health perspective, certainly. considering how much it contributes to infrastructure pressures and things of that nature, even moreso the mental effects it can have on individuals, the trauma of being socially derided for physical stature alone is worthy of several studies. but in defense of fat, there must be some
[05:32:38] <Parf> limit, and some point we might wonder what the real agenda is
[05:34:20] <Parf> who wants people to be fat? mcdonalds. taco bell. fuckin big and tall clothes warehouses. there's plenty of business in just selling empty jargon in defense of self-destructive behavior itself. people want to be consoled in their poor choices, or their limitations, whatever you wish to view it

[05:44:33] <econo> Parf my point wrt balance and pleasure and obesity wasn't that unlimited eating is fine, but that even if overeating to the point of being obese has negative health effects it can still be part of a balanced life. Also that it being unhealthy isn't a good reason to discriminate people on the basis of what is effectively an aesthetic judgment.

[05:48:34] <audrey> p0indexter: let's keep it classy
[05:49:12] <Parf> balance is better than nothing, that's why i said "balance seems good". in reality, it's not "good". it is accepting the lesser of two evils. compromising negative health with limited pleasure and camouflaging it from criticisms by considering it to be "discrimination" to do so is the sort of position that defends to the death a person's right to be overweight. though what is sacrificed for every ounce of excess on every individual? a life, many lives, there
[05:49:12] <Parf> are more considerations to be taken into account than simply one's personal pleasure. we ignore the entire world casually trying to ward off any suggestion that one shouldn't eat a "tub" of ice cream
[05:50:19] <Panther> How about 1/2 tub?
[05:50:45] <Parf> ultimately, the aesthetic sufferings from public mockery is reasonable, in my eyes. they have as much right to ridicule, as the individual has a right to eat.
[05:51:35] <econo> on what basis? Shouldn't the default position be that we shouldn't mock others?
[05:52:02] <Parf> now, if you go and actually try to physically hurt fat people, i question you, and if you openly point and laugh at a fat kid, i'll think you have no heart. i don't think there are totally reasonable motivations for bullying, but i do think it's reasonable to satirize things, to mock things we find awry
[05:52:37] <Parf> is mocking worse than fatness, somehow? is it not a worthy enough trade for you? can't you handle Voltaire? or are you going to chop off his head?
[05:53:14] <Parf> not that Voltaire had anything to say about fatness
[05:53:56] <econo> how do you get from "I don't think we should mock fat people for being fat" to whatever position you're suggesting
[05:54:26] *** catties is now known as catnap
[05:55:16] <Parf> who said i thought we shouldn't mock fat people?
[05:56:03] <econo> i'm asking how you get from the statement i made to the position you're saying i'm espousing
[05:56:53] <Parf> you kill mockery, you kill an integral part of humanity
[05:57:28] <Parf> i for one, like humanity, despite its many flaws. it seems to have the opportunity to find redemption
[06:02:06] <voltage_> it just occurred to me
[06:02:15] <voltage_> "Critical theory (also capitalized as Critical Theory)[1] is an approach to social philosophy that focuses on reflective assessment and critique of society and culture in order to reveal and challenge power structures."
[06:03:12] <voltage_> there is something off about this definition
[06:03:44] <voltage_> like the premise that power structures need to be challenged
[06:04:17] <Parf> as though their being powerful weren't enough to rationalize their existences, why do we destroy structures of power? hmmm
[06:04:20] <voltage_> it seems to be the goal of the study, so it's not to reflect and critique, but to challenge
[06:04:35] <voltage_> but what if you don't find anything to critique?
[06:04:36] <Parf> sounds like good ol' subversion and demoralization to me, volt.
[06:04:38] <voltage_> do you invent it?
[06:04:46] <voltage_> something is wrong here

[16:30:04] <arryana> that's actually an inspired idea
[16:30:17] <arryana> temporarily a little too jetlagged for that, though
[16:30:21] <Delf> voltage_: Narcissism is not always about one thinking that they never do wrong or that they're perfect.
[16:30:21] <voltage_> "Conversational narcissism is a term used by sociologist Charles Derber in his book, The Pursuit of Attention: Power and Ego in Everyday Life. Derber observed that the social support system in America is relatively weak, and this leads people to compete mightily for attention."
[16:30:32] <luminousnine> I'm having some beers on friday
[16:30:36] <arryana> oooh
[16:30:58] <voltage_> "In social situations, they tend to steer the conversation away from others and toward themselves. "Conversational narcissism is the key manifestation of the dominant attention-getting psychology in America," he wrote."

[16:31:18] <Delf> Most behaviors belonging to "devices of disruption" are unable to tolerate themselves.
[16:31:23] <voltage_> " "It occurs in informal conversations among friends, family and coworkers. The profusion of popular literature about listening and the etiquette of managing those who talk constantly about themselves suggests its pervasiveness in everyday life."
[16:31:26] <spruit11> that's true I think
[16:31:44] <Delf> Damn right!
[16:31:51] <spruit11> USians will often steer the conversation towards themselves

[16:33:33] <voltage_> USains Bolts
[16:34:30] <spruit11> not sure about the general populace though.  could be bias because the self-centered ones end up in media.
[16:35:56] <Delf> voltage_: Have you noticed any narcissitic behaviors that you harbour? I researched it a little to find out if I were harboring any and it seems that I do but I forgot which but it's rather tendencies and not so important ones either. Got surprised by how much of the worse behaviors others around me harbours.
[16:36:54] <spruit11> a lot of academics have a bit of narcism,  it's even somewhat encouraged
[16:37:18] <Delf> What kind of narcism?
[16:37:57] <Delf> It's rather vital to NOT commit self-insultry and to know thy own value rather.
[16:38:30] <arryana> if you seriously think you have a mental disorder, you should get real help, not the opinions of irc chatters.
[16:38:43] <Delf> When one does not know their own value, they seek validation from others... or worse, they try to validate themselves at the cost of others.
[16:38:43] <spruit11> somewhat inflated ego because the meritocracy loves telling itself it's better than the rest.  something like that
[16:39:13] <spruit11> useful though.  helps with giving talks and stuff
[16:40:40] <Delf> That's the thing... ones own value must be independent of others, eliminating the need to compare.
[16:41:20] <spruit11> nah,  people are social beings
[16:41:28] <Delf> But in order for that to be of ANY substance, one must be harboring behavior that are fully self-compatible... or else
[16:41:45] <Delf> That would not make people any less social. I'm a good example.
[16:43:13] <Delf> There is nothing you can do or be that can affect my value. Yet here I am, socializing. I value others too because I see similarities. Or rather... I see them as myselves.

[16:47:29] <Delf> Me neither, this is just a consequence of my current understanding
[16:47:52] <DPA> What is a persons value? There are only wrong answers. Defining it is judging people by an arbitrary metric.
[16:48:07] <arryana> value is conditional
[16:48:25] <Delf> spruit11: Consider cats. They're sociable, but you cannot shake the value they have for themselves. Unlike dogs...
[16:48:27] <Delf> And people
[16:49:11] <Delf> DPA: It is it's ability to self-reflect, to understand others or at least try to. To evolve.
[16:51:47] <DPA> I'm like a cat.
[16:51:57] <voltage_> could be narcissism is some kind of empathy disfunction?
[16:52:13] <Delf> For me, self-compatibility is of utmost importance since without it I consider myself an agent to be used by others to abuse others and this will not be tolerated. If I detect such behavior I will do a lot to eliminate it and if deemed impossible, I will self-terminate.

[17:50:37] <lalia> I have a friend on Discord who goes by Neg that's working on a PhD in logic. I enjoy talking to him about these sorts of Cartesian solipsist takes because he can't understand the conclusions and it totally bugs him. So maybe I'm wrong to think it's a side-effect of doubling down on propositional knowledge: seems like simulation/solipsism is just as unpopular among the regulars of logic crowds too.
[17:51:38] <arryana> huh
[17:51:48] <lalia> I'd ask the few lurkers who I'm sure know their shit, but I don't wanna bug people about this: it tends to be an undesirable topic, TBH.
[17:52:52] <spruit11> Philosophy is about speculation too I guess.
[17:54:10] <lalia> The one whol also goes by chu, for example, would probably have interesting insights to offer. :3 Busy cat tho, and like I said: this intersection of interests is typically first-year level pedantry.
[17:54:50] <Crassus> Philosophy seems best placed to speak about its aims. That might not be the best position to be in.
[17:55:18] <lalia> Meaning you're interested in metaphilosophy?
[17:56:17] <lalia> Timothy Williamson's The Philosophy of Philosophy is a great analytic-style text along these lines.
[17:56:59] <lalia> From my background, this touches on philosophy of education and pedagogy for philosophy.
[17:57:48] <lalia> Crassus: It's a well developed narrative with around a hundred years of mature discourse at this point. :P
[17:58:06] <lalia> Lots of great text, including continental perspectives, if that's more your style.
[17:59:52] <Crassus> lalia: Do people outside the story trust it? : P
[18:00:22] <Crassus> lalia: Scientists seem to not like philosophers telling them how to do their jobs tbh.
[18:00:59] <lalia> Commonly, yes. You're welcome to go with whatever conclusion you're into, especially since I'm not sure how to read that last line in a way that pans out.
[18:01:05] <lalia> Would you mind rewording it?
[18:01:32] <lalia> Philosophers don't tend to tell scientists how to do their jobs... that seems like a silly stance.
[18:04:27] <Crassus> Well, epistemologists, philosophers of science, ethics scholars etc. all can have quite prescriptive findings. Not all philosophers work like this, but many do in the Anglo-American analytic tradition.
[18:05:11] <[itchyjunk]> Yeah, ethics scholars are always breathing down someones throat.
[18:05:40] <Crassus> They try to spell outs the limits to knowledge, science, ethical action and so on, which places limits on what you may reasonable in other fields. Popper for example said science should "falsify" hypotheses because inductive proof was impossible for affirmative statements.
[18:05:45] <[itchyjunk]> It's so nauseating in the ML scene.
[18:05:48] <lalia> Do you have any specific examples? I'm having trouble figuring out where you're coming from. The fields you're talking about tend to be cooperative with other fields as often as not. If you're determined to view philosophers as combative, I'd imagine there will be inevitable tensions to point at.
[18:06:07] *** catties is now known as kitties
[18:06:54] <Crassus> In practice though, biologists catalogue birds and so on. It's useful I think. Getting biologists to read philosophy of science would be good I think, but their practice seems pretty divergent from most of the orthodox perspectives out there.

[18:11:21] <[itchyjunk]> I never said you're here to do anything.
[18:11:30] <Crassus> [itchyjunk]: Marx (a philosopher) criticised philosophy. He said philosophers analysed the world, but missed the point - changing it.
[18:11:37] <[itchyjunk]> You're volunteering to talk to say you don't want to talk.
[18:11:46] <[itchyjunk]> Crassus, right

[21:04:23] <spruit11> dunno,  reading the wikipedia page.  depends what you want to get out of it.  if you're a philosopher you should probably know this but most of it reads like drivel
[21:06:49] <lalia> Husserl is important if you have an interest in the foundations of phenomenology or the intellectual development of thinkers like Heidegger.
[21:07:07] <lalia> For a few key reasons to consider his influence and work.

[21:10:49] *** grimvar_ is now known as grimvar
[21:11:40] <proxxy> spruit11: Yes, it does. But I refuse to reject them without getting an idea about what they are saying. Husserl's philosophy as I have heard is a radically different way to look at mind and consciousness than what is prevalent in neuroscience and cognitive studies. I would like to see if there is something to it.
[21:12:33] <spruit11> at some level of intellectual confusion he probably could have a good conversation with shlomif
[21:13:57] <spruit11> proxxy: I have the luxury of not being a philosopher so I just go for what I think are key takes of philosophers
[21:14:44] <proxxy> lalia: What do you think? Can you elaborate?

[21:16:46] <ro-bot-o> [url] Husserl, Edmund | Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | iep.utm.edu
[21:17:17] <lalia> IEP will prove to be a better resource in terms of delivering a more charitable take on Husserl's contributions.
[21:17:26] <proxxy> lalia: I get it. Thanks.
[21:19:18] <lalia> He isn't near my area of work so I have very little ability to articulate his topics clearly without refreshing my memory.
[21:19:32] <lalia> proxxy: I can only remember bits and pieces. :)

[22:38:36] <tesseract> what are you guys doing here? don't you have something to think?
[22:39:04] <audrey> heh. Greetings tesseract
[22:39:16] <audrey> Channel is usually a bit more active, just chilling at the moment.
[22:39:26] <audrey> I'm trying to get back into Sartre's Nausea
[22:39:31] <tesseract> audrey, hi
[22:39:42] <tesseract> i don't know about philosophy
[22:39:43] <nalkri> Arguably one can both think and be connected to communications channels
[22:39:49] <audrey> I read it once about eight years ago, in undergrad. It's one of those books that isn't as interesting on a second read-through.
[22:39:51] <nalkri> Some might even suggest it's preferable
[22:40:10] <audrey> I don't think it's because the writing is bad, it's just difficult subject matter
[22:40:19] <audrey> Anyone else get that impression from Sartre's fictional writing?
[22:40:27] <spruit11> I mistook this for the #techno channel apparently.  Terribly confused mind
[22:40:59] <audrey> tesseract: no worries! the Resources and Research Index in the channel topic are great places to get started if you want a super general overview.
[22:42:27] *** Joins: aototot (~teteetett@92.114.82.95)
[22:42:33] <audrey> This channel isn't super strict about limiting conversation to academic philosophy - literature, art etc. is also fair game if it relates to philosophic ideas or concepts.
[22:43:14] <audrey> So don't feel like you have to be well-read to start participating in conversations. The rules (also in the topic) define the channel's scope.
[22:43:34] <tesseract> ok
[22:43:42] <tesseract> audrey, where are you from?
[22:44:58] <audrey> I'm Russian-American, currently US based. Whereabouts you from?
