[19:42:33] <clime> do you think sample weights are good weight to resolve class imbalance on input? if weaker class has higher weight - it also means that the network avoids punishment for incorrectly categorizing weaker class which means it might exclude certain learning direction that start by a few bad samples in the weaker class. Also If it is not able to guess the weaker class correctly mostly
[19:42:35] <clime> it might still heavily prefer to just keep guessing majority class, so the imbalance problem isn't really solved by it...
[19:42:48] <clime> *are good way to resolve...
[19:48:28] <clime> i suspect that sample weights that comes from unnatural imbalance on input can affect learning negatively - i.e. maybe the network will try to keep guesses more balanced (in case it was somewhat successful to learn the weaker class) but as a side-effect of the "unnatural" sample weights, there will be a negative effect on network learning and performance (e.g. it will have more
[19:48:29] <clime> problems recognizing the majority class than it would normally have)...but i am not sure about all this...just seems to me it could be the case
[19:53:17] <hodapp_> how would a *higher* weight mean the network avoids punishment for incorrect categorization on it?
[19:55:15] <clime> hodapp_: well, i though higher weight means higher loss for incorrectly placed sample - maybe that's not true for categorical crossentropy...
[19:57:38] <clime> idk, it seems to be true after a quick check
[20:02:05] <Hunts> depends on meaning of "resolve class imbalance"
[20:04:47] <hodapp_> clime: if a higher weight does not correspond to a higher loss, then what other effect would it conceivably have?
[20:05:34] <clime> actually, it's true that it probably doesn't matter if the bad guess is false positive with respect to the weaker class or false negative when categorical cross-entropy is used...
[20:21:53] <clime> err, no, false positive means majority sample was used -> i.e. lower weight and lower loss so these cases aren't symmetric. Got a bit confused. ok, I guess my argument didn't make sense then. Maybe what could happen is that the network will try to get rid of incorrectly categorized wekaer samples too hard which will cause some incorrectly categorized samples from the majority
[20:21:55] <clime> class that wouldn't normally be there - but not sure...
[20:27:03] <clime> sries, got confused, should have thought about it more before
