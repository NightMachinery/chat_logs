[00:39:28] <DPA> I noticed something interesting. I'm short sighted. If I look at something from a very low distance, such that what both eyes see has little overlap, then I noticed I tend to be unaware of what the eye that sees less of the thing of interest sees.
[00:39:28] <DPA> I can still focus / decide to see through, booth eyes or only the other one, in that case, though. And all this is without closing any of the eyes in any way. I noticed this while watching a movie from too close a distance, when I realized I saw less of the screen than I should have.

[07:23:15] <kmh_> people are making a living by robbing stores

[11:37:39] <causative> less harsh sentences overall
[11:38:34] <causative> but you can never get rid of the power to punish entirely - the threat has to be there, to stop people from setting up a comfortable family business where they just rob other people at gunpoint without consequence

[11:44:11] <brigand> you said people like that are sociopaths so they can't be stopped either way
[11:44:48] <causative> they can be stopped if the laws and institutions are in place to punish them
[11:45:52] <brigand> a surveillance state?
[11:46:13] <causative> a state
[11:47:00] <brigand> you can't stop every crime

[11:47:17] <causative> this is what makes them a sovereign state
[11:47:53] <causative> no one said you could stop every crime
[11:52:10] <causative> if a state weren't willing to use force against law-breakers, then nothing would stop communities of people from setting up their own regional governments, within the state, and disregarding the authority of the state
[11:54:00] <causative> the state in that case would effectively not exist; the only effective laws are those ultimately backed by a willingness and capability to enforce them
[11:54:27] <causative> and "enforce" really means "penalize people who break them"
[11:56:11] <brigand> i agree that the state should have monopoly on legitimate use of force. so ban private fire arms
[12:01:31] <causative> well, a state needs to be able to enforce its laws - this is not necessarily the same as an absolute monopoly on force
[12:03:25] <causative> the USA - that is, the federal government - does not have a monopoly on force, because the states have their own militias and their own police which act in many ways independently
[12:03:43] <causative> that in addition to private gun ownership
[12:05:43] <causative> the case for or against private gun ownership would have to be made on different grounds, such as safety
[12:06:35] <causative> most people also do not want to live in a state whose power is *absolute* in every domain of life
