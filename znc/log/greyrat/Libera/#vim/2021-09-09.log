[00:27:31] <wickedjargon> Hello there, I would like to recommend vim to a friend who uses windows. I use Linux. Shall I recommend Vim for Widnows or should I recommend Windows Subsystem for Linux + Vim?
[00:27:45] *** Joins: bitmega (~bitmega@user/bitmega)
[00:28:21] <wickedjargon> I heard that powershell now supports colors, so this makes me lean towards vim for windows, but wanted to get recommendations on this.
[00:29:16] <bfredl> you could also use gvim.exe and skip the terminal entirely :)
[00:31:26] <romainl> wickedjargon: you should recommend something you ar familiar with so that you can provide support to that friend
[00:34:55] <romainl> WSL+Vim brings a lot of complexity to the table and many things to learn and fiddle with before even getting into Vim which means a lot of support for you to provide. Doesn't sound like a nice gift. The Windows download seems to be a much more sensible choice.

[01:07:52] <ChewieBeardy> Hello people, I'm stuck at a problem with errorformats
[01:08:23] <ChewieBeardy> I'm trying to improve the errorformat shipped with the official rust.vim plugin, notably to allow arbitrary test failures
[01:09:13] <ChewieBeardy> Since the error diff appears before the file/line/column info, I have to capture it in a multiline
[01:09:44] <ChewieBeardy> but because it's captured, it doesn't show as a line in the quickfix list, and since that diff can be multiple lines long, I don't want to capture it with %m
[01:09:53] <ChewieBeardy> here is the playground I'm working on: https://tinyurl.com/55baxpyf
[01:10:42] <ChewieBeardy> as you can see, first there is an example with a syntax error, and afterwards another example with failing tests
[01:10:59] <romainl> didn't know that site

[01:11:31] <ChewieBeardy> in the first example, the file info appears before the explanatory message (the 4 lines below), and they appear though non valid in my quickfix list
[01:12:02] <ChewieBeardy> but in the second example, the "Diff < left / right >" info is stuck between the start of the failure and the file info
[01:12:09] *** Joins: vvdaiwrw (~rvgzuuqp@gateway/tor-sasl/rvgzuuqp)
[01:12:26] <ChewieBeardy> so I need to be able to ignore them with %C%.%# so that the multiline capture doesn't end prematurily
[01:12:37] <ChewieBeardy> but since they're captured, they don't show in the quickfix list anymore :<

[04:53:27] <nshp> I'm trying to debug why vim inverts my terminal colors every time I start it. The inversion persists even after I quit vim. I'm using a patched up st, so I'm sure it's my fault, but I also haven't changed that code in years and this has just started breaking on some systems.
