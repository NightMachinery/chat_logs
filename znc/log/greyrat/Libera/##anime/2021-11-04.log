[00:14:48] <S_T_A_N> MootPoot, it's a bad meme and it's over done, and it has long outlived any worth it had as a meme, if it ever had any
[00:14:57] <MootPoot> Then..just ignore it?
[00:15:13] <S_T_A_N> How can I ignore something that's everywhere 
[00:15:36] <MootPoot> its only everywhere because the only places you're looking is where NNN exists

[01:40:05] <MootPoot> might have to do video processing and streaming
[01:40:51] <MootPoot> I'm debating between either raspi and arduino or raspi only , OR arduno + android phone ( and just use most of the phone's sensors and shit )
[01:41:21] *** Quits: ninjabuffet (~ninjabuff@user/ninjabuffet) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[01:41:38] <MootPoot> in terms of total cost I guess the phone is probably the best bet seeing 240 bucks gets me a decent one with a lot of crap on it already ( sensors, camera, network, wifi ,battery )
[01:42:57] <MootPoot> I already have a lg g4 I could use for that ... questions is I'm a little lost on how to get a droid to command a arduino
[01:43:28] <MootPoot> there are examples of BT control but I dont trust wireless, and the wired examples I googled for are really old
[01:45:01] <MootPoot> Even if I got that working, my other main concern with the droid is that I'll have all the google crap on it to deal with
[01:45:53] <MootPoot> like, is it even possible to remotely ssh into a android phone and send it commands on what to do so it can do the correct things over the USB otg cable to the arduino
[01:46:19] <viper1829> idk, android is pretty limited with what you can do on it
[01:46:36] <viper1829> though adb does exist
[01:47:23] <viper1829> which has a few useful commands for you to use when doing things with your phone
[01:47:36] <viper1829> just not exactly sure about whether it'd be useful for building a robot brain or not
[01:47:47] <MootPoot> therin lies the problem
[01:49:13] <viper1829> for the raspi and arduino option, you should be able to use alpine linux without a graphical environment to do things
[01:49:41] <viper1829> even with X running with bspwm, the whole os only really takes up about 130mb of ram on idle on my thinkpad
[01:50:27] <MootPoot> The ideal would be smartphone as brain though - since it save so much money from having all the stuff scrammed onto it already
[01:50:31] <MootPoot> maybe suck it up and use BT?
[01:50:56] <viper1829> should work, though i wouldn't use bluetooth because security nightmare
[01:51:01] <viper1829> that's just me though
[01:55:16] <MootPoot> I wonder if a raspberry pi zero w would be enough
[01:55:20] <MootPoot> the new one
[01:55:50] <MootPoot> only has 512mb of ram though

[02:00:26] <viper1829> when did 512mb of ram become "_only_ 512mb of ram"

[02:01:23] <MootPoot> 250kbps of data is plenty

[07:00:17] <Matt|home> you mean the plot is about the concept itself?
[07:00:35] <Aurora_v_kosmose> More like the anime is intended from the start as ecchi and story is secondary to finding excuses.
[07:00:42] <Matt|home> then that is pandering to a T
[07:01:45] <Matt|home> i was reading this psychological horror/drama manga.. and then in the middle of fuckin nowhere one of the main characters strips in her room and we get LOVELY pseudo-hentai shots of her underwear desperately clinging to her body with a thin sheen of sweat
[07:01:53] <Matt|home> this wasn't building up to an erotic scene
[07:01:57] <Matt|home> it was literally; death horror death
[07:01:59] <Matt|home> NUDE SHOT
[07:02:02] <Matt|home> fuck you. just.. fuck you
[07:02:19] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That's not what I meant.
[07:02:30] <Matt|home> brb i have to poop so i don't die i do that sometimes -_-
[07:02:47] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Once you've died a few times I guess it's not scary anymore?

[09:32:48] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: I have learned to respect nature and that humans are not the top of the food chain
[09:35:03] <Aurora_v_kosmose> amigojapan: That's not exactly true. Falcon can be hunted and eaten just fine.
[09:35:17] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Local authorities sometimes take umbrage at that.
[09:35:30] <Aurora_v_kosmose> For some reason.
[09:36:03] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Still, if you hunt enough of them, they'll start steering clear of the general area.
[09:36:59] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: anyway I was defensless against the falcon, and if I had not thrown away the food so they took it, I woke have been seriously injured
[09:37:37] <Aurora_v_kosmose> amigojapan: yes. That's argument for open-carry.
[09:37:56] <amigojapan> I see Aurora_v_kosmose 
[09:38:20] <Aurora_v_kosmose> A net gun or a mundane gun would've been eminently useful in taking it down and recoving the meal plus a bonus meal.

[09:39:13] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: but I guess it's more dangerous to have armed people walking the streets
[09:39:14] <Aurora_v_kosmose> (By mundane let's of course mention that birdshot is called that way for a reason and works much better than other options)
[09:39:44] * Aurora_v_kosmose shrug
[09:39:54] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: is bird shot a shot gun?
[09:40:11] <Aurora_v_kosmose> amigojapan: It's a type of load for shotgun ammo, yes.
[09:40:25] <Aurora_v_kosmose> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shotgun_shell#Birdshot
[09:40:26] <ImoutoBot> [title] Shotgun shell - Wikipedia
[09:40:27] <amigojapan> Ah ok
[09:40:51] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Basically, falcons (and most other birds but especially falcons) move pretty fast, so shooting a single projectile is unlikely to hit.
[09:41:16] <amigojapan> Yeah, it all happened so fast
[09:41:46] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: they swirmed above for a few seconds before attacking
[09:42:03] <Aurora_v_kosmose> But yeah, my point was that humans dip down under the foodchain only when authorities intentionally mandate so.
[09:42:04] <amigojapan> Swormed
[09:42:21] <amigojapan> I see Aurora_v_kosmose 
[09:42:35] <Aurora_v_kosmose> amigojapan: The fact that it has a habit of attacking humans would have me see if an exterminator shouldn't be called though. Because that's not a habit you want spreading.
[09:43:29] <amigojapan> Agreed Aurora_v_kosmose .I bet an exterminator can get a permit to carry arms
[09:44:10] <amigojapan> Even in Japan
[09:44:29] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Yeah, Japan has some pretty harsh laws.
[09:45:33] <amigojapan> Right. But people do get arms to fight bears in Japan
[09:46:01] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Bears, boars, etc.
[09:48:07] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Humans got where they are because of tool-use and teamwork.
[09:48:25] <Aurora_v_kosmose> They lack any other meaningful advantage.

[09:54:37] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: brain enables making high level tools
[09:55:15] <amigojapan> The fire the picture Aurora_v_kosmose 
[09:55:30] <Aurora_v_kosmose> amigojapan: Well yes, I was implying the mental acuity by tool-use & teamwork as specializations.
[09:56:14] <amigojapan> Ah ok. But ants work in teams too. Not a big brain
[09:57:28] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Indeed, arguably they're thriving quite fine.
[09:57:36] <amigojapan> For not fire*
[09:57:46] <amigojapan> True
[09:58:26] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Their lacking ability with tools and relatively simple teamwork however has kept them at a much lower tier on the ladder. Though their size also doesn't help. But insects in general tend to bet on numbers as a survival strategy.
[10:00:42] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: and the falcons swarming may be team work too, not sure

[16:59:49] <Sadale> zoidberg, I'm weavering between Poco X3 Pro and Redmi Note 10 Pro mainly because of performance vs camera.
[16:59:53] <DunceCotus> "That leopard was Wickard!" Said the young person
[17:00:07] <Sadale> Poco X3 Pro is a bit cheaper tho. But that's not big a deal to me

[17:01:15] <Sadale> zoidberg, I'm not really a camera guy. But I'm actually thinking about getting a phone for its camera. This way perhaps I could capture better product video for the projects that I work on.
[17:01:17] <DunceCotus> radical I guess still had sway in early 90s

[17:01:44] <zoidberg> ah I see. Then go for one with better camera Sadale 
[17:01:47] <Sadale> zoidberg, I've already got other el cheapo photography equipment ready. El cheapo lightings, el cheapo gimbal, el cheapo green screen and el cheapo green screen holder.
[17:02:14] <Sadale> zoidberg, But gaming may be equally important. Especially that I don't often take product videos. That's why I'm weavering xD

[17:51:58] <emmeka> tbh, I didn't watch much of it
[17:52:24] <DunceCotus> Coffee and cigarettiquette 
[17:52:31] <emmeka> but the original is basically the best sitcom this country ever produced, which is a low bar, but still.
[17:52:47] * amigojapan is starting to get sleepy
[17:52:53] <amigojapan> Brb
[17:53:12] <emmeka> I feel like a lot of the sort of style and format of Canadian TV has been lost now, which is a bit sad.

[17:53:27] <zoidberg> emmeka: wow, you amaze me. How can you not watch corner gas knowing how good it is?!
[17:53:44] <emmeka> zoidberg no I've watched pretty much all of the original, when it was new.
[17:53:44] <zoidberg> emmeka: the last episode has a famous guest star
[17:53:52] <emmeka> the animated one, I have not seen much of
[17:54:07] <zoidberg> I mean not watch the animated one.

[17:57:51] <emmeka> I'm not sure it's even enjoyable to someone who doesn't know the events/politics they're making fun of. But This Hour Has 22 Minutes is basically a satirical news show, except they do all sorts of real life interviews and zany crap
[17:57:56] <zoidberg> Brent is a jackass for ending it so soon

[17:58:59] <zoidberg> emmeka: and also corner gas is the only show that has two presidents played guest role.
[17:59:30] <zoidberg> emmeka: oh, that reminds me of Rowan Atkinson's not the nine o clock news
[17:59:38] <emmeka> or they had Talking to Americans, where they'd go to the US and say something obviously fake about Canada to random Americans and see if they believed it, sometimes they even tripped up politicians including several governors.
[18:00:36] <DunceCotus> nut the nine o' cock.. no nutvember

[18:02:28] <DunceCotus> I see
[18:03:35] <zoidberg> It depends but having a general idea of what it's about is good enough to get the joke. I have watched a lot of Jon Stewart's videos first, googled what's he talking about and then watched it again, still funny << emmeka 
[18:04:36] <emmeka> zoidberg if you want some old Canadian TV in the spirit of Corner Gas, I guess I'd recommend the Red Green Show

[21:23:27] <roshen> only sheeple and gamers use it
[21:23:33] <roshen> cheap gamers
[21:23:57] <roshen> sorry 
[21:24:04] <Bco1981> yes... it's cheap getting 5 VR headsets
[21:24:28] <roshen> i like consoles better for gaming
[21:24:40] <roshen> m&k give me carpultunel
[21:24:59] <Bco1981> because gaming on linux in vr is obviously working better...
[21:25:09] <Bco1981> hint, not.
[21:25:30] <roshen> read what i wrote =p
[21:25:44] <roshen> wine works pretty well too
[21:25:53] <roshen> but, not great
[21:26:05] <roshen> i couldn't get everquest running, and league of legends had problems for a while
[21:26:11] <Bco1981> has to work great. anything less is useless in vr
[21:26:14] <roshen> but it mostly works fine
[21:26:25] <roshen> consoles > pc gaming imo
[21:26:51] <roshen> wine generally works great
[21:27:02] <roshen> but there are many exceptions that don't work
[21:27:10] <ButterNoodle> just use windows
[21:27:25] <roshen> no
[21:27:33] <roshen> don't use loseblows
[21:27:38] <roshen> it's horrible
[21:27:38] <Bco1981> stop wine'in and just use what works

[21:35:12] <roshen> that's the most massive ultra-oversimplification i've seen anyone make in the last 6 months

[21:39:39] <potatoxel[m]> i want to update when i want to.
[21:39:46] <roshen> linux is better

[21:39:52] <roshen> than loseblows
[21:39:57] <roshen> in every way
[21:39:58] <potatoxel[m]> and i'd like my OS to only have free software
[21:40:03] <potatoxel[m]> so windows needs to be removed
[21:40:17] <ButterNoodle> just stay off the internet kids
[21:40:21] <ButterNoodle> ez
[21:40:29] <potatoxel[m]> well i dont plan to use steam
[21:40:31] <Bco1981> best safe internet
[21:40:34] <snake> potatoxel[m], once a pc has windows, it is already permanently contaminated

[21:40:50] <roshen> your advice applies to yourself only buttnoodle
[21:40:55] <snake> even swapping harddrives will not get rid of the microsoft backdoors
[21:41:01] <potatoxel[m]> MootPoot: spyware, i guess but u can remove the thing u installed
[21:41:07] <ButterNoodle> yea thats why windows has the market share.. everywhere
[21:41:10] <potatoxel[m]> with windows u need to remove windows

[22:18:31] <S_T_A_N> The PS3 did Linux at first as well
[22:19:01] <emmeka> roshen so Sony claimed that the PS2 was a home computer for tax purposes in the EU, not a game console, because PCs are taxed cheaper than videogames there, or something
[22:19:03] <S_T_A_N> Gamecube is insane though, it doesn't even have a harddrive?
[22:19:05] <emmeka> the EU took issue with this
[22:19:14] <emmeka> so Sony released a fullblown linux distro for the PS2.

[23:03:29] <Bco1981> oh! here's a updated lib, don't worry you won't need that old one anymore.... then what ever i compiled from source no longer works... yes... so superior... so much better.
[23:04:25] <roshen> basically the only downside of linux is trying to get software that was not designed to run on linux to run
[23:04:40] <roshen> and you need your oculus
[23:04:40] <Bco1981> MootPoot: ah okay, i didn't know. funny thou my rpi4 case is a block of aluminum that wifi and BT works okay.
[23:05:17] <Bco1981> source code software designed to be compiled on linux was not ment to be run on linux ?
[23:05:29] <roshen> so ya, it would take a long time to get something like oculus to run
