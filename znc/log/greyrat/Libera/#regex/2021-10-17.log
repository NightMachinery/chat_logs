[02:17:40] <VectorX> eggbean how are you running this ? ie is it in a text file or in the CLI, if latter what command
[02:18:08] *** Joins: cmbengue (~Thunderbi@207.191.249.160)
[02:18:59] <eggbean> VectorX: Intended to use on cli (actually script) and just looking into how to do that now. Find command seems to be the way?
[02:19:46] <VectorX> find . -name 'id_*' ! -name 'id_*.pub'
[02:20:55] <eggbean> VectorX: Seems easier, but would it be better than `-regextype posix-egrep -regex ...`?
[02:21:42] <eggbean> Got some sunk cost in getting that regex together you see
[02:22:25] <maroon> this also matchies 'id_' ^id_.*$(?<!\.pub$)

[14:18:57] <Chaphasilor> Hi there! I have what seems like a trivial question, but I just can't figure it out on my own...
[14:20:09] <Chaphasilor> So I have a situation (simplified to https://regex101.com/r/HrzZHX/1), where I what to "lazily" match a pattern, but instead of using the closest end, I need the closest start 
[14:21:08] <Chaphasilor> in the example, in the string "a   a  b", I want to match "a  b", but I always end up including the first "a" as well...
[14:22:04] <Chaphasilor> Do I need something like a lookahead for this, that makes sure the "start" doesn't appear a second time before the "end" of the pattern?
[14:30:01] <Me-me> Unfortunately there's no such thing as a "lazy start" because it won't know about there being a full match later in the string until it gets there - by which point it has to have checked at the earlier start location first.
[14:30:22] <Me-me> A lookbehind is also tricky except in something like .NET which has full LTR/RTL support.
[14:31:13] <Me-me> Your best bet is to examine whatever conditions there are in the pattern and engineer it such that it won't match at that earlier position if a later match is possible, e.g. a[^a]*b
[14:31:24] <Me-me> Or a[^ab]*b even.
[14:31:34] <Me-me> But with more complicated patterns that logic gets harder.

[22:19:16] <re101-adelie-82> I want to find the names of the two passed tests...what has to be changed in the regex?
[22:21:08] <VectorX> re101-adelie-82 what should be the resulting value?
[22:22:37] <re101-adelie-82> 1. TestSomeIPConnection  2.someIPSlimActivityGetData

[22:24:16] <VectorX> oops
[22:27:42] <re101-adelie-82> i want to find the next occurrence of  toggleDetails\('    after passing , not the last

[22:31:19] <VectorX> https://regex101.com/r/BagfZx/3
[22:34:15] <VectorX> actually this might be better https://regex101.com/r/BagfZx/4
[22:38:19] <re101-adelie-82> that cool, but I need the matches returned as a group
[22:42:33] <VectorX> does this work https://regex101.com/r/BagfZx/5
[22:44:40] <VectorX> and if you need the other stuff it matches, https://regex101.com/r/BagfZx/5
[22:45:33] <VectorX> not quite sure how this helps since you already know what is matching is passing to get the exact value with v4, beside you have variations in the html that would make it fail
[22:45:58] <re101-adelie-82> yes, thats what i need. Thx!  where can I find a good explanation on what this \K does?
[22:47:01] <VectorX> https://www.regular-expressions.info/keep.html
[22:47:53] <VectorX> it doesnt work with every regex engine, so you have to be careful where you use it, ie in PHP its fine

[23:50:00] <Release_> for example Guestgfuiy126523 shouldnt be exempted or skipped rather
