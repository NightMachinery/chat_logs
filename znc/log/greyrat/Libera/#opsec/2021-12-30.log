[02:22:07] <Joanna> I’ve read the conversation from earlier and it’s hard to to conclude that most consumer electronics is practically intended to be hackable. I also believe that there have to be computers in existence that are more secure that are not available to the public.
[02:26:46] <Joanna> In any case the less things are connected to internet the more secure they probably are. I know this isn’t possible for all computing but I separate different activities onto different machines. The computer I use for programming hardly ever is connected to internet.
[02:46:48] <jan6> Joanna: here, I made a bit of text art of your name, among some others ;P https://jan6.tilde.cafe/textos/?joanna
[02:48:30] <jan6> there's a simple reason why most things aren't intended to be hackable, two, actually, 1) if someone breaks their thing, they're gonna sue the maker, even if their failed to follow instructions, and 2) the less people know about how the things works, the more BS marketing they can push, and the higher they can raise the prices for even fundamentally pretty trivial items

[04:52:22] <JimBuntu> Howdy peeps... I'm probably also gone by the time you read this, idk
[04:52:39] <epony> there are a couple of GH repos with files and instructions, and a couple of presenations by researches (Russian) on CCC and other conferences
[04:53:55] <epony> the IME (intel management engine) and Amd's variant of it, is not the only point of concern though, there are even USB debug capabilities of the main CPU and transient execution vulnerabilities in HW
[04:54:42] <epony> also certification is not a technical solution, it's a validation of a checklist that gets validated one way or another, not necessarily technically correct and resilient
[04:55:27] <epony> the path to secure computing excludes unknown implants (black boxes) of any sort in any of the modules in the computing complex you're using
[04:55:44] <JimBuntu> USB debug, let alone JTAG and similar
[04:55:48] <epony> yes
[04:55:56] <epony> JTAG is a serial programming interface
[04:56:34] <JimBuntu> yes, the vuln depends on what you want to attack. Accessible items are abound, especially when you don't require realtime memory access, not that this is limited by JTAG
[04:56:42] <epony> it's exposed on many eletronics and not disabled, but there is programming controllers that make it "work" and they are reprogrammable too, in FLASH/ROM or other EEPROM memory
[04:56:54] <epony> there are also trivial DMA attack vectors on periphery
[04:56:55] <JimBuntu> exactly
[04:57:46] <JimBuntu> I hear what you are laying down epony, homegrown is the only pureblood
[04:57:57] <epony> it's a real problem, and the solution excludes highly integrated very complex machines like laptops and mobile / embedded devices without complete reprogramming and control (at least for the concernt data processing lines)
[04:58:36] <epony> also, you can have a completely insecure platform and a secure computation on top of it, if the insecure parts do not have access, exposure and capability of data in-band interaction
[04:59:36] <epony> however, the CPU is vulnerable in hardware faults and leaks data at the rate of 5-50 KB/s from the internals of the computation, that is enough for continuous audio and periodic video surveillance, key extraction and undermines the computation in full
[05:00:17] <epony> therefore, you have to process information disconnected and with validation control of the input and output, meaning an offline manually converted or with specialised conversion equipment
[05:00:18] <JimBuntu> It always boils down to a signal being passed, it's basically always an option to insert a no-op at the right place or reverse a logic decision and divert the path. That is where 'intelligent' systems change things up.
[05:01:18] <epony> yes, side channels, environmental and electric conditions, and tamper resist are basically enough to secure, most of the time, but that does not mean a secure system, it means partially complimented completely weak and susceptible system
[05:02:43] <epony> secure systems are using different electrical designs that have redundant information that eliminates interference and computation intercept and manipulation and have separate data and control paths (including syncro-separation)
[05:03:13] <JimBuntu> timing can be controlled pretty well, isolated power systems isolate (lol) from possible freq based attack or detection, EMF generation can be mitigated.  It really ends up reduced to the hardware, where it was designed, made, etc.
[05:04:06] <epony> the internal design of the device components differ in secure systems from commercial electronics (cheap) and general availability (consumer)
[05:04:24] <epony> both in specification and in functionality and built-in operation
[05:04:50] <epony> commercial computers are low quality electronics in terms of security and resilience
[05:04:53] *** Quits: plankster (~plankster@user/plankers) (Quit: No Ping reply in 180 seconds.)
[05:05:09] <epony> laptops are a primary example of weak computing
[05:05:17] <JimBuntu> of course they are, somewhat by the name it's implies
[05:05:52] <JimBuntu> commercial level hardware has less restrictions and requirements, especially when we talk about EM since they are expected to be around only 8 hours per day
[05:07:42] <epony> it is possible to do improved qualities computation on commercial off-the-shelf computer modules, the form factor is ATX and ITX and modular interchangeable systems
[05:08:22] *** Joins: plankster (~plankster@user/plankers)
[05:08:28] <epony> that is why servers and business and military computers are using form factors with better specification modular and industrial quality computer components
[05:09:34] <JimBuntu> Well, we can still skip the EM via shielding... and we can always link systems together for some level of improved compute power as a whole. Being removed from the network in general limits direct attacks even if the general hardware is vuln.  RNG systems excluded and replaced.
[05:09:36] <epony> laptops have their place in general "office" and "portable" comms, but not for "work", "command" and "control"
[05:10:24] <JimBuntu> Like everything, it's in levels. Levels of privacy, security from observation or inference.
[05:10:43] <epony> also general availability "amateur" and "commercial" quality software has defects and does not conform the specifications of reliable / resilient computation
[05:11:09] <JimBuntu> That is why the STANDARDS exist though
[05:11:45] <epony> yes, standards have various levels of compliance, and various specifications, for different applications, and some standards are secret and classified
[05:11:49] <JimBuntu> We could all have secure and safe, but would we want to pay for it in time or money (which is time to some effect)
[05:12:18] <epony> we could have "less deffective" by intent
[05:12:47] <JimBuntu> Well, that would be a good start
[05:13:31] <epony> everything released to the public is using known reference designs that are done with double purpose, not for what you expect or receive as information prior to the purchase-sale point
[05:14:58] <epony> it is not pure coincidence, though there are also defects discovered by accident, misuse and unintended failures at design and manufacture, the once you're concerned are built-in on purpose for real reasons that you can not easily avoid or bypass
[05:15:00] <JimBuntu> Yes and we even detected this on a dodlevel a while back. Brand new 'name band' hardware that had been altered prior to arrival at the facilities. Was a big deal.
[05:16:47] <epony> watch regularly security conferences to get informed at the level of complexity and the number of challenges, and reduce the usage of "highly integrated" all-in-one computer bundles like laptops and mobile phones and consumer appliances like routers and barebones, is a start in the right direction
[05:17:30] <epony> you have to do what businesses and service providers do, on a much much smaller personal or small business re-implementation scale
[05:17:56] <epony> that, and understanding why you're doing it, and where it can degrade or be undermined
[05:18:35] <epony> generally, that is what industrial, scientific and medical computing is about, improving reliability and other qualities of general and specialised computers
[05:19:41] <jan6> tbh @certification-is-useless, it's kinda sounding similar to software testing, the best sort of test is not a checklist of "does this and that", it's "property-based testing", where you have specifications what a thing does, and fuzz the input of all possible values, so instead of testing "echo 123abc" it might discover a bug by testing with weird unicode characters, or discover an accidental
[05:19:42] <jan6> underflow because zero-bytes aren't taken care of, or whatever
[05:20:55] <epony> it has to be part of the design and programming of the computation elements and individial components, most electronics components have correct and well known technical specification and properties, which are a form of initial certification
[05:21:21] <epony> so this has to be carried completely, at any step it can be undermined or compromised by defects and irregularities
[05:21:29] <jan6> also the main problem with closed-source anything, is that often there might be some oversight, or bad design decision, that nobody knows about, but IF it was public, it'd be picked up very quickly
[05:22:33] <jan6> some game console I think had some terrible design like that, iirc, like the copy protection could be bypassed super easily, and it was even one of the "big ones", like xboz or playstation or something, don't remember really
[05:23:47] <epony> thus, top down certification is just "partial compliance" with procured orders and qualities and parameters added over time, not built in from the start by expertise and strict precision (so is correct to consider it bogus and pointless, that is applied to education replacement you get as "applied use" with "certification" for financial and job compliance, not real engineering, that is certification is bogus and pointless for people too, it is not a solution, 
[05:23:47] <epony> it's a attempt to improvi minimally and pass order requiremens)
[05:25:42] <epony> in short: validation and complete system specification is "mandatory" from the individual components to the full system complex of computing deployed, and fails at "components integration" and "computer and microcircuitry" programming
[05:27:21] <epony> that is where the real problems with laptops are, not the "name of the device" or "marketing claims", but the integration and programming, because it does not comply with any security and reliability, it's an individual "entry level" component to a larger computer, itself being insecure and faulty, disposable and consumerised as "recycle point"
[05:28:15] <epony> so laptops are used as portable consoles, not real computers ;-) get it?
[05:29:20] <epony> it's just a replacement for a monitor & computer you use for "monitoring" and "control" of the real computers that do the work of computation and control
[05:29:45] <epony> replaces a teletype, not the mainframe
[05:33:56] <jan6> well, it does one, but for security, it'd need the other ;P
[05:34:49] <jan6> modern computers are trying to do everything, focusing on apparent speed and performance without any actual need for it, and without caring too much for security
[05:34:59] <jan6> but as long as the standards are open, it's always fixable
[05:35:31] <epony> standards are very important
[05:35:42] <jan6> like you can replace your proprietary BIOS with coreboot, thanks to standards, you can TECHNICALLY replace any other part too
[05:35:42] <epony> and open architectures
[05:36:18] <jan6> the main problem is having effective, but technically-not monopolies and duopolies and whatever
[05:36:42] <epony> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_architecture is the only acceptable one for industrial computers
[05:37:57] <jan6> unless you spend a ton of money on custom-manifacturing the important parts, it's gonna be pretty hard to do such stuff these days
[05:38:15] <epony> "monopoly for decades continue to provide Closed Architecture to devices such as Laptops, Tablets, Smart Phones"
[05:38:30] <epony> ^ consumables
[05:39:02] <epony> open architectures are a 50 year long production
[05:39:30] <jan6> risc-v is also quite great
[05:39:34] <jan6> modularity is awesome
[05:39:34] <epony> starts with mini- and micro-computers, and is modular and system component standardised
[05:39:45] <jan6> open AND modular architecture
[05:40:26] <epony> it's not yet been deployed commercially and has no general availability, platform on "draft" and "research" stages pre-commercialisation
[05:41:07] <epony> should have been a process in the 80ies and 90ies to have commercial significance 10-20 years later
[05:41:35] <epony> it failed with other RISC family platforms
[05:41:36] <jan6> although on one hand you can't rely on a common set of instructions, on the other, you can optimize a lot better, and BECAUSE you can't run everything on every risc-v cpu, that's also gonna make malware a lot less able to use deep tactics, like specific registers, or whatever
[05:41:49] <jan6> at least ARM is a thing
[05:42:34] <epony> services only the vendors segment for closed architectures, it's a problem of the commercial services sectors
[05:43:02] <epony> has poor programmability and non-uniform / non-standard system specification (lacks standards)
[05:43:37] <epony> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Base_System_Architecture is late and can't solve the closed architectures problems
[05:44:09] <jan6> nothing will help, all is failed, the end is night
[05:44:09] <jan6> ;P
[05:44:11] <epony> it's a low effort to compete in the server markets for secondary (tertiary) markets
[05:44:23] * jan6 would love ternary computing to become a thing
[05:44:49] <epony> technically, there are solutions, they are just not laptops, tablets and smart phones, nor arm chips as "end" computers
[05:45:03] <epony> arm chips are micro-controller level computing
[05:45:47] <epony> it can not happen, it's just HEX and because of the double 8-bit computing (better applied to data encoding)
[05:46:13] <epony> data and coding schemes set these
[05:46:35] <epony> the computers are binary systems because that is how the key switch components work at individual level
[05:46:47] <epony> bi-stable transistor logic
[05:48:20] <epony> the multistate is used with partial success to storage (flashrom and other memory devices)
[05:48:54] <jan6> epony: rambling neverending stream of thoughts, nice
[05:50:37] <epony> that's how things are, on IRC, you seem to mostly object when it's not how you think it is, but when it is a fact of replies to incorrect statements, you seem to oppose without substance
[05:51:41] <epony> you can't escape facts and reality with wishful thinking and "influence" of like minded people to a common fallacy
[05:52:44] <jan6> the trick is that I never have substance to begin with
[05:53:13] <jan6> most of the things I say aren't backed by any facts, only opinions, memories, and assumptions
[05:53:26] <epony> that's why people read books and/or go to school or use reference information to which to make modifications or corrections
[05:53:47] <epony> to get a common correct "understanding"
[05:54:13] <jan6> most of the time I'm mostly correct
[05:54:28] <epony> for most of the intended use of the information ;-)
[05:55:19] <epony> just when you recommend a laptop as a solution, do not forget, it's not.. it's the problem
[05:55:56] <jan6> one laptop is a solution to another laptop's problems ;P
[05:56:28] <epony> partially, with reproduction of the same problems that it does not address, for the duration you're stuck with it
[05:56:29] <jan6> ultimately, everything depends on 1) your requirements, and 2) how far you're willing to go to reach them
[05:56:44] <epony> or just sane recommendations
[05:56:54] <jan6> laptops are just very convenient and portable, for example
[05:57:02] <jan6> but not necessarily the most secure, yes
[05:57:12] <epony> at least in the set of topics claimed by "security"-concerned public
[05:58:00] <jan6> I think the main problem with tech industry is trying to push for "speed" and "performance" where there's not been any real need for it for like, a decade
[05:58:02] <epony> it's also worth nothing, that there are 4-5 large laptop board vendors, and most of the orders pass through them, and they use refernce designs from Intel and Amd
[05:58:38] <epony> so, you think you're getting a "brand Alternative universe" while you're getting a different label on the case
[05:58:58] <epony> no, the real problem is false product separation
[05:59:12] <jan6> most of it isn't "false"
[05:59:24] <jan6> it's just non-obvious they're linked
[05:59:35] <epony> you just don't have a secure or resilient laptops, that's not a category you can get, they are repackaged same problems with different "branding" and "paint"
[05:59:57] <jan6> resilient to what? ;P
[06:00:55] <jan6> also sure, everyone uses references from the makers of the CPUs that they want to be compatible with, but other than that, there are ones with stuff like hardware killswitches, or whatever, too
[06:01:15] <epony> so marketing a brand is as silly as looking the the paint and considering what qualities it has, from reading the leaflet of "advertised differences compared to any of the rest of undesirable" while they come out of the same production lines and actually your alternative universe product is low quality batches after the bigger and more successful vendors have completed their runs
[06:01:39] <jan6> NOT using the "reccommended setup" means you have to sink a LOOOOT of money and time and resources into researching your own
[06:01:53] <jan6> which is why nobody bothers, because there's basically no tangible gain
[06:02:22] <epony> it means, recommending a brand of laptops to be more secure and a solution to the other laptops, is a scam online

[15:29:29] <Joanna> It seems like the objective of the majority modern computers including phones and iot devices is to distract and spy upon us rather than crunch numbers. Sure they seem fun and convenient but I’m not sure it’s worth it for what we are losing. It’s like a deal with the devil. I also believe that much of the hype about security in many cases is to scare and distract us rather than find ways to make us safer. For instance the 
[15:29:29] <Joanna> problem of possible terrorists with bombs. That’s a bad problem which could be mitigated by recruiting hundreds of millions of civilian dog owners to help. People walking their dogs would alert to suspicious things. But did that happen? Nope because the objective is not to solve  security threats, the objective is a never ending supply of problems of every sort imaginable.

[16:20:00] <micronn> Companies should provide services/products/benefits for people, but instead are systems to make profit for their stakeholders, which may also be companies. As the time goes by, there are less stakeholders that are persons. So, we're fucked.

[17:02:20] <Joanna> It’s like a game of monopoly.
[17:03:14] <Joanna> I think the biggest problem is that the majority of people tolerate things that they shouldn’t.
[17:04:46] <Joanna> It should be obvious how unfair everything is. We are in many ways worse off than medieval serfs. At least serfs had a lot of holidays:)
[17:07:03] <Joanna> For business,There is most definitely a motivation to profit from some very destructive things.
[17:09:53] <Joanna> A lot of the worst ideas ever come up with masquerade as things that are going to improve our lives and bring prosperity.

[17:45:37] <micronn> The majority of people don't even have to tolerate things. It just has to look like this. Some surveys are disgusting. How is our web site? a) good b) very good c) excelent. What do you want in our web site? a) better images b) better fonts. No. I don't want any of these. I want a functional site that lets me do the task I was trying to do, that I've done in the past in far less steps.

[17:56:04] <Joanna> Yea that’s true it’s only necessary to convince people that the majority of everyone else approves of something and they will go along with it. Hence the very effective advertising industry.
[17:56:55] <bogen85> "I want a functional site that lets me do the task I was trying to do, that I've done in the past in far less steps." Most web site makers don't know how to make proper sites...
[17:57:23] <bogen85> especially the newer ones... sites (even internal corporate ones) are getting dumber and dumber...
[17:58:05] <Joanna> I really dislike modern websites with a lot of empty space where you have to scroll
[17:58:36] <bogen85> They seem to assume to a phone display sized screen and don't have enough options to do something that use to be simple.
[17:58:41] <Joanna> And websites filled with advertisements
[17:59:05] <bogen85> I run ublock origin, that eliminates the adverts...
[17:59:43] <Joanna> I don’t like people who try to advertise to me :)
[18:00:59] <bogen85> (with ublock origin none of your information makes it back to them, and you don't see what they are pushing). My banking site use to easy to use... Until they merged the desktop and tablet variants of the site... Now it is just a dumbed down tablet version...
[18:01:03] <Joanna> What is left of website with unblock? Empty space?
[18:01:57] <bogen85> ublock origin. The sites appear like they should for me... I generally don't go to sites filled with ads anyways...
[18:02:38] <Joanna> I find banking apps very hard to navigate and I don’t like the way logout is not always available. I consider that a security risk.
[18:03:09] <bogen85> ublock just gets rid of the one or two that I would have tuned out anyways... I'm more concerned the the tracking of my habits by advertisers than the one or two adverts I tune out..
[18:03:32] <Joanna> I wish I could have a search engine that ignores sites with ads
[18:04:25] <bogen85> Just use ublock origin in your browser. and on your phone use an ad-blocker. I bank on my desktop via a web page... It is easy to logout, and it is logging me out anyways after any amount of inactivity.
[18:04:28] <Joanna> Oh yea I get gigantic cookies on my machine from places I’ve never visited.
[18:04:50] <bogen85> yeah, use u-block origin to block those sites...
[18:04:59] <bogen85> Anyways, I need to go to work
[18:05:00] <bogen85> TTYL
[18:05:11] <Joanna> Ok see you later
