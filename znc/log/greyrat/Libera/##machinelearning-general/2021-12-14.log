[01:50:23] <Sheilong> I ran a Kcross val scoring with RMSE and R2. I am quite confused. For instance, where the model has a ~9.48 RMSE it giver a 0.82 of R^2. Meanwhile with a rmse of 1.246 I have 0.48 of R^2.

[01:59:34] <mefistofeles> Sheilong: they are different things, MSE/RMSE is good for measuring performance of a model, specially if it's regression, but it is prone to errors due to scaling, so R² might be better in those cases... since it's unit/scale invariant
[02:00:09] <mefistofeles> the point is that you have to choose the right metric and criteria for what you want to answer/predict

[02:07:48] <Sheilong> I am working with a regression problem. I have a timeseries data, but it is not uniformly distributed. Then I did a resample on the data and performed a grid cross validation to find out the best method to fill missing values after resample it. I am using a linear regression as a baseline, however the results making me confused.

[15:05:02] <Klinda> hodapp: so in the framework you are using, in the softmax function they don't calculate the stability for softmax?
[15:05:15] <Klinda> what framework is it?
[15:13:22] <hodapp> Klinda: so, this isn't precisely softmax, but the entire paper is about how to combine a couple operations - including softmax - into a kernelized approximation
[15:14:40] <Klinda> you did it from scratch?
[15:14:42] <hodapp> so it's more softmax-like than precisely softmax, but it still involves exp(...) divided by a sum of a bunch of exp(...)
[15:14:43] <Klinda> what paper is it?
[15:14:47] <hodapp> Performers
[15:14:58] <Klinda> what does it mean??
[15:15:00] <Klinda> xD
[15:15:16] <hodapp> don't have the title handy but there should be really only one paper about transformers/attention that mentions Performers
[15:15:25] <Klinda> ah ok
[15:15:55] <hodapp> they are very very terse on the "practical" math, but very long-winded on the theoretical math and proofs
[15:16:02] <hodapp> so I had to do a lot of guesswork
[15:16:13] <Klinda> yeah I am noob reading papers
[15:16:34] <Klinda> math is the key of ml, Hunts doesn't admit it
[15:16:35] <Klinda> ahaha
[15:17:14] <Klinda> btw why are you looking to this paper hodapp?
[15:17:52] <hodapp> doing some experiments on transformers at work
[15:18:02] *** Joins: DnzAtWrk (~DnzAtWrk@mobile-access-6df047-236.dhcp.inet.fi)
[15:18:12] <hodapp> but the O(n^2) issue is a bit of a pain indeed and this is why there are so many papers that try to find ways around it
[15:18:45] <hodapp> Performers is one, Linformer is another (albeit only by tying it to a specific sequence length), SimpleTron is just a degenerate case of Performers
[15:18:54] <Klinda> how much big is your dataset ?
[15:19:20] <hodapp> doesn't matter, the O(n^2) isn't about the dataset size, it's about the sequence length the transformer is handling
[15:20:12] <Klinda> understand
[15:26:54] <Hunts> Klinda: do not put claims on me, I will not play that game
[15:28:33] <Klinda> maybe you said that because you are good in math
[15:28:48] <Klinda> I stil need to understand a lot of math stuff involved

[20:15:31] <[itchyjunk]> i am kinda impressed.

[20:18:14] <mefistofeles> [itchyjunk]: that's fine, it's all pretty closed, but it's still appreciated... I just don't think it's that impressive

[20:20:16] <[itchyjunk]> It's fairly impressive to me. I've only played with it for a little.
[20:20:30] <[itchyjunk]> I don't think there is anything comparable to it out there currently.

[22:29:16] <Klinda> is cross validation the use of the validation set or am I missing something?
[22:32:45] <hodapp> in general yes but there are a few different kinds
[22:32:55] <hodapp> most common in deep learning tends to be holdout method
[22:33:44] <hodapp> in more 'classic' ML you'll still see k-fold cross-val
[22:38:21] <hodapp> in certain time-series settings you'll see roll-forward cross-validation
[22:39:02] <Klinda> if I am using the linear discriminat analysis I should use the k-fold?
[22:39:29] *** Quits: tomeaton17 (~tomeaton1@92.234.2.175) (Quit: Client closed)
[22:39:38] <hodapp> hmm dunno
[22:40:02] *** Quits: Andrynet1 (~Andrynet@186.46.205.112) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[22:41:03] <hodapp> it can depend on how much data you have and how practical it is to train multiple models
[22:41:40] <Klinda> my data with smote technique I have (224, 16) matrix
[22:42:25] *** Joins: Andrynet1 (~Andrynet@186.46.205.112)
[22:57:51] <hodapp> you're probably fine to start with k-fold
[22:58:36] *** Joins: georgios (~georgios@user/georgios)
[23:03:21] <Klinda> what number of k should I choose?
[23:03:42] <mefistofeles> Klinda: 10 is a common choice
[23:05:58] <hodapp> yeah, start at 5 or 10, and if your model is very fast to train you can start making it higher and you'll get a better estimate of performance
