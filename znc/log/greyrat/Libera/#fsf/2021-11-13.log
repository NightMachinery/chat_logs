[17:34:48] <belgin> Kaiod, the only software component of the website that can be free is the JavaScript. You can either not use any JavaScript or make sure it's licensed under a free license. There is no freedom seal for websites as far as I know.

[20:20:46] <leah> guix is a piece of shit, and it breaks multiple standards. and gnu software is bloated as hell. busybox/plan9 coreutils are more efficient, and musl/uclibc are more efficient at their job

[20:23:59] <leah> KE0VVT: or just install any modern BSD
[20:24:02] <KE0VVT> As I said, Gobo had to break FHS too.
[20:24:05] <Noisytoot> leah, Plan 9 is also POSIX non-compliant
[20:24:15] <KE0VVT> leah: I thought we were in GNU+Linux land.
[20:24:20] <leah> Noisytoot: yeah busybox is better, for posix compliance
[20:24:27] <KE0VVT> If you want Unix in GNU+Linux land, use Slackware.
[20:24:42] <leah> KE0VVT: there are other userlands available

[20:52:48] <M6piz7wk[m]> belgin: and i plan on using it! hurd is cool
[20:53:04] <belgin> nice. i saw a few years ago it can run firefox
[20:53:12] <Noisytoot> tpefreedom, Guile is better.
[20:53:13] <M6piz7wk[m]> imagine if everyone was on hurd we would have one huge network super computer
[20:53:34] <Noisytoot> It also uses systemd instead of GNU shepherd.
[20:53:44] <M6piz7wk[m]> oh ye that
[20:53:58] <M6piz7wk[m]> and they refusing to enable non-systemd implementation and the whole thing is basically wrapper for systemd
[20:54:00] <M6piz7wk[m]> disgusting
[20:54:15] <M6piz7wk[m]> guix allows me to work on alternative inits ^-^
[20:54:27] <leah> i've hurd of wildebeests, but this is all very gnu to me
[20:54:49] <tpefreedom> leah, very punny

[20:56:11] <M6piz7wk[m]> so does micropenis but i wouldn't boast about it 
[20:56:29] <tpefreedom> leah, why microkernels?
[20:57:00] <leah> hurd is a microkernel
[20:57:10] <belgin> wow look at this! https://archhurd.org/ i'm going to see if it works on my x60 xD
[20:57:23] <M6piz7wk[m]> ehww arch
[20:57:25] <leah> as opposed to linux, which is a monolith kernel
[20:57:30] <M6piz7wk[m]> why do you put that thing in front of my eyes
[20:57:48] <leah> hurd kernel, with busybox+musl, or bsd userspace
[20:58:11] <M6piz7wk[m]> leah: last time i checked monolithic kernels were criticized for their lack of flexibility and one of the main reasons for Redox to be a thing
[20:58:12] <leah> bsd+hurd
[20:59:33] <Noisytoot> Why not GNU/Hurd?
[20:59:40] <Noisytoot> BSD doesn't have Hurd-specific things
[21:00:02] <M6piz7wk[m]> Noisytoot: bcs GNU follows FHS3_0 
[21:00:17] <Noisytoot> What's FHS3_0?
[21:00:17] <M6piz7wk[m]> which is not optimized for nix :p
[21:00:35] <M6piz7wk[m]> File hierarchy Standard 3.0
[21:00:42] <Noisytoot> Why with an underscore?
[21:00:49] <M6piz7wk[m]> that thing linux foundation is supposed to maintain and they didn't bother since 2004
[21:00:59] <M6piz7wk[m]> Noisytoot: standardized way of referring to it :p
[21:01:13] <M6piz7wk[m]> bcs dots are allegedly too common in terms of language definition
