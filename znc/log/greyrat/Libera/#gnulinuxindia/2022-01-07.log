[00:06:08] <Govindas[m]> Use common sense.
[00:06:08] <Govindas[m]>  Exactly. If not sure. Meditate a while. You might get some awareness.
[00:06:28] <Govindas[m]> a person who meditates is far from common sense, as common sense doesn't even know what meditation is

[08:49:33] <Arya[m]123> lol
[08:49:47] <Arya[m]123> btw i setup my own matrix homeserver
[08:50:08] <Arya[m]123> hosted in my house. 
[08:50:13] <relejek[m]> Oh yeah i just noticed that. matrix.aryak.ml
[08:50:24] <relejek[m]> you are awesome my guy.
[08:50:42] <Arya[m]123> it was pretty hard to wrap my head around the stuff 
[08:50:49] <relejek[m]> wut you build it on r-pi or your system?
[08:50:50] <Arya[m]123> buit after that it was pretty easy
[08:51:00] <Arya[m]123> relejek[m]: i have an old i3 machine 
[08:51:08] <Arya[m]123> which runs proxmoix
[08:51:27] <relejek[m]> aaha giving new life to an old mate. respect that.
[08:51:28] <Arya[m]123> i am running the synapse on a rocky linux lxc comntainer with 1 core and 2 gigs ram
[08:52:00] <Arya[m]123> matrix isnt that storaage intensive either tbh
[08:52:10] <relejek[m]> did you need to do that port-forwarding thing?
[08:52:17] <Arya[m]123> port tunneling :)
[08:52:19] <relejek[m]> or you used CDN tunnel?
[08:52:23] <Arya[m]123> cloudflare shit

[08:52:34] <relejek[m]> gotcha
[08:52:55] <Arya[m]123> synapse is just  2 gigs
[08:54:23] <relejek[m]> how much synapse take in ram? i heard it is on the bit of the heavy side.
[08:56:03] <NeoVoid[m]> <Arya[m]123> "btw i setup my own matrix..." <- great you could make post about it in gli site
[08:56:30] <Arya[m]123> relejek[m]: 1.2 gigs
[08:56:42] <Arya[m]123> i was thinking of putting on my blog 
[08:56:53] <Arya[m]123> maybe i can mirror it in gli

[08:58:31] <Arya[m]123> with whatsapp bridge element and synapse
[08:58:53] <relejek[m]> yeah that a dyum hoevy boi
[08:58:58] <Arya[m]123> not that heavy
[09:00:59] <relejek[m]> it is though. anything that uses more ram than your browser is a heavy s/w. and it has to run all the time while you're using matrix.
[09:01:21] <relejek[m]> ^ IMO*
[09:01:52] <Arya[m]123> brave + firefox + schil;dichat + element == more than 2 gigs
[09:02:02] <Arya[m]123> 😂😂
[09:02:48] <relejek[m]> Your use case is unique i must say.
[09:02:57] <Arya[m]123> yeah 
[09:03:09] <relejek[m]> why do you need to run 2 browsers and 2 matrix clients lol
[09:03:10] <relejek[m]> ?
[09:03:16] <Arya[m]123> brave for meetings firefox for normal browsing schildichat for my old matrix account 
[09:03:21] <Arya[m]123> and element for new one 
[09:03:27] <Arya[m]123> i will probably stop having schildichat
[09:03:43] <Arya[m]123> i had it because i couldnt join big rooms with my homeserver
[09:03:49] <relejek[m]> yeah. element doesn't support multi-account yet.
[09:04:00] <Arya[m]123> now that i fixed it i will probably use just one
[09:05:12] <relejek[m]> alright buddy. i'll get back to doing some work now. see you in 3hrs maybe. cheers.
[09:05:22] <Arya[m]123> bye
[09:05:31] <Arya[m]123> btw pihole + unbound is really worth it
[10:51:02] <hemish> I got vaccinated today being 16 years od. Why the fuck certificate has a photo of PM?
[10:51:07] <hemish> *old
[10:51:20] <Arya[m]123> hemish: idk
[11:01:00] <vipul[m]> <hemish> "I got vaccinated today being..." <- because he initiated the campaign lol
[12:01:18] <gtlsgamr> 12:51      hemish │  I got vaccinated today being 16 years od. Why the fuck certificate has a photo of PM? )) <--- Because it is 
[12:03:21] <Aryan[m]> Thank You Modi ji for coronavirus
[12:07:29] <pal[m]> <vipul[m]> "because he initiated the..." <- I got vaccinated in dubai and all we have in our certificate is the governments logo
[12:09:17] <relejek[m]> hey all, again.
[12:09:38] <relejek[m]> so, vax has started for <18yrs peeps nice.
[12:13:26] <relejek[m]> and yes every one has PM's face on their vax certi. coz blatant marketing/branding of "everything 'good' comes from Current PM", to keep up is popularity and brand image in the populous. it is like when brands do subtle product placement in a 'potential' box office hit flix, but in PM's PR team's case they rather not be subtle. 
[12:14:23] <pal[m]> Lol yeah
[12:16:55] <klimi[m]> <relejek[m]> "so, vax has started for <18yrs..." <- in india you didn't vax <18 yet? oh
[12:34:02] <vipul[m]> <pal[m]> "I got vaccinated in dubai and..." <- Yeah
[13:16:16] <relejek[m]> <klimi[m]> "in india you didn't vax <18 yet?..." <- 45+ coz they are most susceptible to causalities. 18+ are at priority coz they are the productive population, i.e. the nations economy runs  on them, thus they have to get out to work. so they get priority.
[13:16:16] <relejek[m]> also <18yrs aren't allowed to got out, that group has very low covid mortality rate (exception applies), and they attend to their studies online. that makes it even lower priority.

[14:01:19] <NeoVoid[m]> it was been subject of wonder in luke smith cult group
[14:02:06] <NightFury[m]> NeoVoid[m]: Ohh
[14:18:33] <gtlsgamr> What is luke smith cult group?
[14:18:38] <gtlsgamr> Wait.. I don't wanna know.
[14:18:49] <Arya[m]123> lukesmiths matrix iirc
[14:18:54] <Arya[m]123> oh no his telegram
[14:21:02] <gtlsgamr> By the way thanks NeoVoid[m] for introducing me to invidious
[14:21:05] <gtlsgamr> its ingenious!
[14:22:20] <gtlsgamr> ingenius*
[14:30:06] <Govindas[m]> you shouldn't get vaccinated, you'll regret it later
[14:39:20] <gtlsgamr> Govindas[m]: why?
[14:40:31] <Govindas[m]> unknown long term effects
[14:40:45] <gtlsgamr> oh, you're one of those. 
[14:41:26] <Govindas[m]> and even if it's safe, with how unvaccinated tend to be treated by governments today, I wouldn't support their tyranny by submitting to it
[14:43:34] <gtlsgamr> ah! you're one of those too...
[14:43:49] <Arya[m]123> lol
[14:44:05] <Arya[m]123> this is not the place to discuss about vaxx stuff anyways 
[14:44:16] <gtlsgamr> yes.
[14:44:21] <gtlsgamr> lets stop it now. :)
[14:44:34] <Arya[m]123> i wont delete the messages or ban you for this tho
[14:44:45] <Govindas[m]> Arya[m]123: I agree, I only said my message so the above conversation isn't too one-sided
[14:44:52] <Arya[m]123> ok
[14:46:55] <vipul[m]> <Govindas[m]> "unknown long term effects" <- Life is full of risks. Anyways 🤷
[15:04:36] <gtlsgamr> What is everyone doing today?
[15:10:06] <vlad[m]> Travelling in yours truly indian railways
[15:10:47] <gtlsgamr> Vlad you are enjoying it
[15:11:17] <vlad[m]> No because I'm losing tower too often
[15:12:56] <gtlsgamr> That's Vlad. :(
[15:13:43] <vlad[m]> Is this what happens when your definition of peak comedy is comicstaan
[15:14:31] <vipul[m]> vlad[m]: Kya baat hai. General dabbe me?
[15:14:41] <gtlsgamr> vlad[m]: come on man.
[15:14:45] <gtlsgamr> the name is nice :(
[15:23:06] <klimi[m]> > <@relejek:matrix.org> 45+ coz they are most susceptible to causalities. 18+ are at priority coz they are the productive population, i.e. the nations economy runs  on them, thus they have to get out to work. so they get priority.

[15:23:06] <klimi[m]> that's interesting... anyone here can go get the vaxx... and everyone can do nearly anything as long as you are vaxxed... :D
[15:25:47] <vlad[m]> <vipul[m]> "Kya baat hai. General dabbe me?" <- Flex hein, AC seater
[15:26:16] <vlad[m]> But they did not turn on the damn AV

[15:26:42] <vlad[m]> Sab chutiye hein
[15:27:19] <Arya[m]123> lmao
[15:32:36] <NeoVoid[m]> <gtlsgamr> "By the way thanks Neo Void for..." <- yep me too. 
[15:32:36] <NeoVoid[m]> That instance was what i was looking for.
[15:33:11] <Arya[m]123> i am trying to make my sway config work for both i3  and sway
[15:33:20] <Arya[m]123> what is the i3 replacement for swayidle
[15:33:39] <klimi[m]> whats swayidle?
[15:34:15] <NeoVoid[m]> Thanks to that pretty married woman who teaches cyber security and stuff i got it. 
[15:34:15] <NeoVoid[m]> I hope i could make something like that with newpipe in web.
[15:34:27] <Arya[m]123> it allows you to execute commands when the pc has been idle for x time
[15:34:38] <Arya[m]123> and a command to resume
[15:37:10] <NeoVoid[m]> wait does that mean now for wayland we need different gnuutils tools which support it
[15:37:19] <NeoVoid[m]> ????
[15:37:27] <Arya[m]123> no gnuutils
[15:37:32] <Arya[m]123> what gnuutils are you talking about
[15:37:51] <Arya[m]123> i am talking about X replacements for wayland software
[15:38:03] <NeoVoid[m]> wayland doesnt support much of applications does that include common cli tools too
[15:38:20] <Arya[m]123> cli tools have nothing to do with waylnad
[15:38:36] <NeoVoid[m]> pardon my newbieness.
[15:38:39] <Arya[m]123> xorg cli tools like xdotool do have alternatives for wayland (ydotool)
[15:39:05] <NeoVoid[m]> hmm thats what i supposed
[15:39:26] <NeoVoid[m]> why we are even shifting over to new world.
[15:39:32] <Arya[m]123> i want an Xorg alternative for a wayland (more like swaywm) tool called swayidle
[15:39:41] <Arya[m]123> it is way more smooth on non-nvidia
[15:39:56] <NeoVoid[m]> this doesnt make sense.
[15:40:09] <Arya[m]123> and many utils  are more polished imo
[15:42:05] <NeoVoid[m]> some other part of the world there would be different protocol for display they might be working on. like zland. and all the others developer will start to migrate over zland, then we will get zdotools, zorg, zi3 lol
[15:42:21] <smud[m]> What does swayidle do?
[15:42:32] <Arya[m]123> <Arya[m]123> "it allows you to execute..." <- .
[15:42:47] <smud[m]> Oh
