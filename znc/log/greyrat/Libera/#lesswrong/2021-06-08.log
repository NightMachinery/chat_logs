[00:00:40] <kuudes> could it also somehow autoaim?
[00:00:58] <kuudes> ie you point it to the general vicinity of the target and pull the trigger, it positions the barrel to best shot
[00:01:47] <ggreer> IIRC, it only fires when you have the trigger pulled and the rifle is oriented such that the shot would hit the target
[00:02:07] <kuudes> hmm, ok

[01:14:42] <otoburb> Lark.* was taken? 
[01:18:41] <ggreer> heh I got mask shamed at the store. this old guy came up to me and said, "you look a little short on masks" and I was like "what? I'm vaccinated" and then he just kinda walked away
[01:19:32] <spxtr> do you skip the mask even in stores that have posted "wear a mask inside" signs?
[01:19:56] <ggreer> I don't really pay attention to them. most stores have signs saying "mask unless vaccinated"
[01:20:35] <ggreer> except for the women-owned coffee shop. they have an angry sign about how you always need to have a mask and it has to cover your nose
[01:20:43] <spxtr> they still make us wear masks at all times indoors here despite almost 100% vaccination rate and 0 cases on campus for the last 3 weeks
[01:20:46] <spxtr> complete theater
[01:21:29] <kuudes> well, uk has rising case count
[01:22:08] <ggreer> also all the stereotypes about who wears masks and who doesn't are 100% true. you go to trader joes and everyone's wearing a mask and treating everyone else like they're radioactive
[01:22:43] <ggreer> go you to a gun shop and nobody is wearing a mask and they have a state-mandated sign on the door about how they got fined for not having masks
[01:23:50] <kuudes> no place in usa has had a curfew yet, isn't it?
[01:24:11] <ggreer> I think some places tried but there's no way it could be enforced
[01:24:26] <ggreer> the only curfews that have worked have been in response to riots
[01:24:47] <spxtr> in Palo Alto most people still wear masks outdoors. very annoying because I don't want to be associated with the unwashed masses but really?
[01:25:11] <ggreer> I'm visiting the bay area in a couple weeks. I assume I will get mask shamed a lot but whatever
[01:25:32] <spxtr> one of my friends is much more brave than me and has been masked shamed a few times
[01:25:34] <ggreer> just weird to have it happen in vancouver of all places
[01:25:36] <spxtr> but overall most places don't bother
[01:25:41] <kuudes> it is weird. given the militarization level one would expect usa of all places be able to enforce police actions
[01:25:48] <kuudes> ie just shoot the criminals like you do
[01:26:32] <kuudes> also with all stand-your-ground laws couldn't the hoas just appoint guards that shoot any intruders
[01:27:04] <ggreer> only a very blue place would institute a curfew and then they'd have to arrest a shitload of people who violated it
[01:27:37] <kuudes> uk has now reached usa in second dose fraction
[01:28:01] <kuudes> yeah, but usa has prisons :)
[01:28:19] <kuudes> how large fraction of people there are already in the can? 1%?
[01:28:55] <ggreer> something like that, but it's not like we're locking up people for jaywalking. the US has >5x the violent crime rate of europe so we should expect to have 5x as many incarcerated people
[01:29:42] <kuudes> yeah, but that means that doubling the number of prisoners would allow you to put 1% more to prison
[01:30:00] <kuudes> ie capacity already exists
[01:30:33] <saturn2> not really, there's already an overcrowding problem
[01:30:38] <ggreer> it takes a very long time to imprison someone. you have to arrest them, then have a trial (or a plea deal), then sentence them. look at how long it's taking for say... rittenhouse to get imprisoned or not. it's very expensive so the state doesn't do it unless they absolutely have to

[01:31:11] <ggreer> and you'd get a bunch of sob stories about random babysitters or grandmas arrested and jailed for being out after curfew
[01:31:13] <kuudes> saturn2, sure, but isn't there everywhere such
[01:31:38] <ggreer> anyone in government who was involved in such a scandal would risk losing the next election
[01:32:03] <kuudes> but inmates can't vote, can they :->
[01:32:28] <spxtr> felons can't, not sure about inmates
[01:32:30] <kuudes> ... btw why don't they just incarcerate the other side
[01:32:34] <ggreer> many states don't let convicted felons vote. you have to be imprisoned for more than a year for a felony
[01:32:37] <saturn2> that seems like a nonsequitur
[01:32:43] <kuudes> eh, ok
[01:33:07] <kuudes> but yeah, I am biting my fingernails over the indian variant and others :)
[01:33:27] <ggreer> I'm not worried. so what if people get covid? what matters is if they die or are permanently injured
[01:33:39] <ggreer> the vaccines seem to be extremely effective at preventing death and permanent injury
[01:33:46] <kuudes> maybe, maybe not
[01:34:08] <kuudes> I hope you are correct
[01:35:59] <kuudes> it seems to me very possible that in usa they are currently in the phase of "hype the vaccine so that people take it"

[02:28:58] <shawwwn> and jonathan is the most amazing support person I've ever had the pleasure of interacting with.

[02:30:01] <shawwwn> > rmmh: GPUs pale in comparison to the power of a TPU pod
[02:30:01] <shawwwn> this is true. more surprisingly, GPUs pale in comparison to the power of a *single regular TPU*.  A plain ol' TPU is a 96-core 335RAM beast, even if it's a v2-8. So it's like a gigantic server with 8 GPUs attached
[02:30:38] <shawwwn> previously no one could take advantage of it, because you had to write everything in fucking tensorflow (only a few people are crazy enough to spend months or years doing this)
[02:30:42] <shawwwn> but now you can SSH in and run whatever you want
[02:30:43] <spxtr> but can it run crysis on high settings?

[02:32:27] <shawwwn> it'll take about a year for the tooling to stabilize and converge, but I've seen zero indications that it's unstable or anything less than rock-solid right now. The situation is just that no one's yet made the binding from X language to libtpu. libtpu itself seems to give all the power.

[02:43:46] <shawwwn> ooo, trippy.
[02:43:50] <shawwwn> what's it doing?
[02:43:56] <RiversHaveWings> training
[02:44:05] <shawwwn> hm. my gut reaction is that it's not.
[02:44:27] <shawwwn> my justification is that, in our experience, whenever training is happening for any gan, all patterns change over time
[02:44:29] <shawwwn> even if subtlyl
[02:44:35] <shawwwn> but in this case, everything seems to be frozen in place
[02:44:47] <RiversHaveWings> yeah wait a bit
[02:44:47] <shawwwn> you're right that it *eventually* changes, but
[02:45:03] <RiversHaveWings> i'm holding the latents constant
[02:45:03] <shawwwn> hmmmmmmm
[02:45:25] <shawwwn> ... whoa
[02:45:31] <RiversHaveWings> eheh
[02:45:59] <shawwwn> hrm. the thing is, it's super awesome. I'm just reluctant to agree that it counts as a successfully-training run
[02:46:11] <RiversHaveWings> yeah i ctrl-c'd it by accident
[02:46:18] <shawwwn> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/FmFv3UQT/image.png
[02:46:20] <RiversHaveWings> before it got actually good
[02:46:41] <shawwwn> what I mean is, there's a reason I was super hype about your CLIP GAN. It's because I noticed the same kind of training patterns overnight as we saw when ours finally worked
[02:46:47] <RiversHaveWings> oh?
[02:46:47] <shawwwn> and then the end result was of course evident that you nailed it
[02:46:50] <shawwwn> yeah
[02:46:57] <RiversHaveWings> ah
[02:47:02] <shawwwn> when you were like, "it trains super slow" and showed the results after overnight
[02:47:13] <shawwwn> I said no no, this is good, there's all kinds of increase in detail and pattern complexity
[02:47:18] <kuudes> hmm. it would be interesting if any training step would count bitcount(xor(previous_state, current_state)) of weights and keep summing it
[02:47:27] <shawwwn> but here, well... I just don't see it. Did it get much better after the ctrl-c?

[02:47:45] <RiversHaveWings> and then i went on to other stuff
[02:47:50] <shawwwn> gotcha.
[02:48:09] <shawwwn> that was a fucking sweet video though, for real. I've never seen training in that level of detail
[02:48:15] <Ralith> Obormot\Arcturus: never imagined you'd be big on premixed spices, let alone dried garlic
[02:48:17] <shawwwn> did you spit out a frame every training step or something? with fixed latents
[02:48:23] <RiversHaveWings> shawwwn: every third step
[02:48:42] <RiversHaveWings> and latents were fixed for the output frames
[02:48:45] <kuudes> yeah, you can sort of "see" where each of those minipictures are re each other

[02:48:53] <shawwwn> yis
[02:48:59] <RiversHaveWings> all my demo grids use fixed latents
[02:49:12] <kuudes> it sort of "moves" the structure those pictures are, inside the latent space
[02:49:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ralith: I use individual stuff too, but this works well on things that don't need specific or strong flavoring but just need a little bit of something, like potatoes (either fried or baked)
[02:49:21] <shawwwn> it's interesting that the patterns are so uniform for every sample, early on
[02:49:26] <shawwwn> but that it oscillates wildly
[02:49:31] <RiversHaveWings> like the clipgan ones had fixed z (different for each grid entry) as well as fixed CLIP embeddings
[02:49:33] <RiversHaveWings> yes
[02:49:44] <RiversHaveWings> it rotates
[02:49:47] <RiversHaveWings> i think
[02:49:54] <shawwwn> RiversHaveWings: you should totally upload this to youtube, and tweet about it. it's one of the neatest little training videos I've seen, no exaggeration
[02:50:00] <RiversHaveWings> i have an mnist one too
[02:50:04] <RiversHaveWings> did you see it
[02:50:11] <kuudes> well those flashes seem to me like it is doing a back-and-forth calibration of some measure
[02:50:20] <shawwwn> pretty sure this level of detail is enough of a step-change in quality to reveal things that no one realized were happening (subtle dynamics that are hard to infer from screenshots every 50 training steps)
[02:50:22] <RiversHaveWings> it doesn't look color cycley but it actually ends up working

[02:50:42] <Robomot> video/mp4 (31.3 MB)
[02:50:55] <kuudes> but guys, how hard would it be to integrate my shower thought to loss log?
[02:51:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ralith: For meat I make a custom flavoring mix but for potatoes, this premixed stuff is just very high return on (almost nonexistent) effort, where anything fancier would be largely pointless (and in any case you mostly want it to NOT be strongly flavored)
[02:51:23] <shawwwn> RiversHaveWings: is this the exact same gan architecture, just with mnist instead of cifar?
[02:51:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ralith: Also, I've mentioned chicken salt to you, right
[02:51:35] <shawwwn> kuudes: dunno, I missed it. got a reference?
[02:51:48] <kuudes> bitcount(xor(weights_start, weights_end))

[02:52:37] <shawwwn> ha! okay, that was really cool. I didn't expect it to be rows of 0's, rows of 1's, etc... then suddenly it was. https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/GwY42klD/image.png
[02:52:55] <shawwwn> yes, definitely, these videos should be preserved somewhere. super neat.
[02:52:56] <kuudes> on small things it should not return anything meaningful, but I have hunchs that on large training batches it could return meaningful metric
[02:53:01] <RiversHaveWings> shawwwn: no
[02:53:04] <RiversHaveWings> but it is similar
[02:53:13] <RiversHaveWings> the mnist one has no noise inputs
[02:53:18] <RiversHaveWings> to each feature map
[02:53:20] <RiversHaveWings> like the cifar one did
[02:53:33] <RiversHaveWings> i think it also may be not residual
[02:53:35] <shawwwn> RiversHaveWings: I thought so. This had all the signs of "this training run is working"
[02:53:51] <shawwwn> in particular, the early dynamics are nothing like the cifar run. but, mnist makes it hard to compare.
[02:53:56] <Ralith> Obormot\Arcturus: rings a bell, yes
[02:53:58] <RiversHaveWings> you can see some cycling
[02:54:07] <RiversHaveWings> but it can't rotate in color space like the cifar gan can
[02:54:15] <shawwwn> there's cycling, but in the cifar run there's very little pattern complexity increase / change

[02:54:25] <shawwwn> with the mnist run, the complexity gets better and better
[02:54:26] <RiversHaveWings> cifar is way harder
[02:54:32] <RiversHaveWings> *way* harder
[02:54:34] <shawwwn> yes, and therefore it should be oscillating way more
[02:54:40] <shawwwn> but the patterns look almost frozen
[02:54:59] <shawwwn> they barely change till you watch for a long time. this isn't the expected behavior of a working training run
[02:55:02] <kuudes> RiversHaveWings, does the training here have momentum?
[02:55:15] <shawwwn> I suspect that if you hadn't ctrl-c'd, it wouldn't have achieved much. but it's hard to say for sure.
[02:55:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ralith: I've been using it for a little while now (cut with cornflour to increase pourability), it's a bit sweeter than I like but it's a good addition to my toolkit for sure

[02:55:30] <Ralith> interesting
[02:55:43] <Ralith> I do need to up my spice game
[02:55:53] <kuudes> Ralith, yeah. I was just pondering that it seems to sort of be moving "in one dimension at time"
[02:56:35] <shawwwn> kuudes: interesting. that's a bit like graphing the specnorms, I think -- both would give a sense of "these weights are changing a lot" vs "this layer is flat"
[02:56:38] <shawwwn> not a bad idea.
[02:56:47] <kuudes> shawwwn, nothing fancy. just take the raw bytes of the weights matrix, xor them each other, count how many 1s there are, report that sum per each step
[02:57:09] <kuudes> I mean, I would expect it maybe to show us sort of "how much information has went into the end result while training"
[02:57:40] <kuudes> so then one might be able to compare different training run efficiencies etc
[02:58:00] <kuudes> "these 1M training steps did about as much of work as these 1G steps here in this other type of network"
[02:58:13] <shawwwn> yeah. it's surprisingly in the "huh, not a bad idea" bucket. most ideas end up in the "yeah, *maybe*, but wow that'd be hard and also don't get your hopes up it'd work"
[02:58:21] <kuudes> yeah
[02:58:25] <shawwwn> this one would also work even better for analyzing bfloat16 behavior too
[02:58:26] <RiversHaveWings> kuudes: you can measure path length
[02:58:29] <shawwwn> and float16 vs float32
[02:58:43] <RiversHaveWings> but paths can rotate or meander or be noisy
[02:58:45] <kuudes> RiversHaveWings, hmm, what does that mean?
[02:59:13] <kuudes> the distance it moves in the latent space per each training step?
[02:59:22] <RiversHaveWings> the distance in parameter space
[02:59:25] <kuudes> ah
[02:59:41] <kuudes> yeah, indeed, that makes sense
[02:59:44] <RiversHaveWings> i doubt it's very informative tbh
[03:00:03] <RiversHaveWings> because of noise
[03:00:09] <kuudes> well, it would, I suppose
[03:00:21] <kuudes> the thing is a fractal
[03:00:33] <RiversHaveWings> i mean the gradients are stochastic
[03:00:41] <kuudes> you know, "length of beach" type of thing. but they could be comparable to each other
[03:01:01] <kuudes> ie a "better" trainer would take a more direct, faster route
[03:01:16] <kuudes> like how it is different driving coast of norway or middle of finland
[03:02:18] <kuudes> yeah, on limit they should be equivalent, actually
[03:02:38] <kuudes> ie if you had a binary parameter space, ie if you had 1-bit nn, then they would be equal
[03:02:53] <kuudes> as the bitcount(xor()) is just hamming distance
[03:03:00] <kuudes> so they both are sums of distance metrics
[03:03:59] <kuudes> I guess one could maybe try to intuit loss progress out of that as well
[03:04:12] <RiversHaveWings> why would you even xor floats
[03:04:18] *** Quits: tex (~super@user/dix) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[03:04:25] <kuudes> ie if the parameter change speed is low, then it is sort of "optimizing" not "exploring"
[03:04:33] <RiversHaveWings> it would be swamped by low significant bit noise
[03:04:33] <kuudes> because it is easy
[03:04:44] <RiversHaveWings> just take the euclidean norm of the step
[03:04:53] <kuudes> yeah, the cognitive bet is that over billions of steps the noise does not matter anymore
[03:06:07] <kuudes> I mean, the work for the computer to treat the bits as numbers is significantly higher than for it to just treat them as bits

[03:06:46] <RiversHaveWings> it's *tiny* compared to the amount of computation required per step, trust me
[03:07:27] <kuudes> sure
[03:07:59] <kuudes> hmm, but the bitspace is log of numberspace, isn't it
[03:08:21] <kuudes> I don't know
[03:09:01] <kuudes> but this feels like this should be some very small n steps per phase, like less than 100 tpu instructions total
[03:09:42] <kuudes> xor this memory with this memory and put the result into that memory. bitcount that memory
[03:10:20] <saturn2> do tpus have the nsa instruction?

[03:16:15] <RiversHaveWings> shawwwn: i started logging every batch's losses to a csv
[03:16:17] <RiversHaveWings> one csv per worker
[03:16:40] <RiversHaveWings> i can take all eight csvs and take the mean
[03:17:32] <kuudes> is your loss in real space?
[03:17:50] <RiversHaveWings> it's a scalar?
[03:18:08] <kuudes> yeah, but can it go < 0 ?
[03:18:23] <RiversHaveWings> not with the current losses
[03:18:29] <RiversHaveWings> with some of the earlier ones it could
[03:18:53] <kuudes> then it is in exp space, I think
[03:19:22] <kuudes> meh, I am getting too into details :)
[03:19:25] <RiversHaveWings> losses can be a variety of things
[03:19:33] <RiversHaveWings> often they are something like mean squared error
[03:19:50] <RiversHaveWings> so they cannot go negative, but their interpretation is quadratic
[03:20:21] <kuudes> isn't their combination then also hypotenuse instead of mean?
[03:20:23] <RiversHaveWings> like my CLIP contrastive loss and my G and D losses are -log of a sigmoid
[03:20:30] <RiversHaveWings> and the gradient penalty loss is quadratic
[03:21:13] <kuudes> yeah. I try to make my numerology to be in real space so that I can just spam it with averages etc
[03:21:39] <RiversHaveWings> however the previous losses, which could go negative, were still valid if averaged
[03:23:08] <kuudes> yes, then average works

[10:04:43] <ggreer> Drone relays could allow delivery of any small package anywhere on the same continent at a delivery speed of 100mph. I think cost would be higher than current couriers though, at least over distances >200 miles

[10:43:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> I am not sure what to think about this kind of take

I was skeptical about UBI in 2019 because I thought too many people would opt out of the workforce for UBI to succeed, but the experience of the last 16 months has made that argument even stronger than I expected."
[10:44:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> Were people really thinking "well, if we give everyone enough money to live without having to work at all, then probably most people will keep working anyhow, so that's fine, so I'm in favor of UBI"?

[11:16:50] <nshepperd2> what is the effect on overall employment?
[11:17:14] <saturn2> americans work way too much, so it's good if they work less
[11:17:40] <saturn2> (and can still live)
[11:17:41] <adiabatic> fewer employed-hours worked by the lower-skilled
[11:17:59] <capisce> it's a feature, not a bug
[11:18:14] <capisce> letting people spend less time working jobs they hate
[11:18:34] <brigand> i think the argument is that people will stop working entirely
[11:18:36] <nshepperd2> i don't really feel like i've been significantly affected by people not wanting to work because of covid-related stimulus checks, only by official service closures for 'health reasons'
[11:19:13] <capisce> some people might stop working entirely, maybe there are no jobs available that they wouldn't hate
[11:19:20] <nshepperd2> so if this is what UBI + a scary pandemic does, it seems more like it's shown that UBI won't actually affect the workforce enough for me to care

[11:40:03] <adiabatic> I have been through econ 101 and I too believe that taxes cause deadweight loss
[11:40:24] <nshepperd2> what taxes
[11:40:50] <nshepperd2> we were talking about covid-related stimulus checks
[11:41:09] <nshepperd2> also, lol: 'My restaurant eventually went out of business permanently so I'm back to drawing $430/week. If I were hired into a job similar to my old job, I would earn $200/week, forfeit the entire $430, and effectively pay a 215% income tax on my gross wages.'
[11:43:08] <nshepperd2> so disemployment has been small enough for me to not care, with both a scary pandemic going on at the same time, and totally fucked incentives worse than any UBI proposal

[12:11:22] <kuudes> at least in finland it seems people pay less in wage taxes than they get public services for
[12:11:35] <kuudes> the extra comes from corporate taxes and vat
[12:13:07] <kuudes> also, the cases (n=2) of officer exchange from finland to usa (police and a fireman) both said usa uses way many redundant people, like 6 persons to do 1 person job

[12:13:39] <kuudes> so my prior is that currently usa does welfare sort of similar as here in finland was while ussr existed - basic jobs type of thing
[12:13:56] <kuudes> ie make-work to employ people so that they can be paid by the government
[12:14:15] <kuudes> the alternative is to fire redundant people but then you need to pay unemployment benefits
[12:14:37] <kuudes> ie after the fall of ussr unemployment in finland went from something like 2% -> 15%
[12:14:47] <kuudes> and now our steady state is somewhere around 7%
[12:15:38] <kuudes> so it depends imo on how, in what form, one wants to pay money for "good people who have little use to others"
[12:16:48] <Mark_> I assume the tens of millions of euros that finland has spent on sending troops to afghanistan are counted as highly valuable public services to people in finland?
[12:17:43] <capisce> kuudes: why did finland move away from basic jobs after the fall of the ussr?
[12:18:32] <kuudes> economic crash + free market idealization
[12:20:00] <kuudes> yeah, over here peacekeepers to afganistan (which now ended) are professional soldiers, not basic jobs, peacekeeping is sort of a "practical excursion" in military career
[12:21:13] <Mark_> I assume finland’s spending on education is also counted as providing highly valuable public services to finns, rather than as having negative value?
[12:21:21] <kuudes> yes
[12:22:12] <kuudes> are you getting somewhere?
[12:22:59] <Mark_> yes
[12:23:07] <kuudes> please do so faster.
[12:23:18] <Mark_> I have doubts about the methodology used to determine the value of the public services
[12:23:39] <kuudes> money is hard *shrugs*
[12:23:59] <kuudes> there are many reasonable criticism of money value, yes
[12:24:44] <Mark_> some people think that the fed’s low rates and open-market operations have disproportionate effect on inflation of asset prices and have thus been responsible for the mortgage crisis, the stock market boom in 2020 and 2021...
[12:24:51] <kuudes> for instance, clearly defence spending have not produced any result because we haven't had a war
[12:25:10] <kuudes> asset prices don't have inflation or deflation as they are not consumer prices
[12:25:52] <kuudes> no one owes other people to have their housing valued at certain amount of food etc
[12:26:40] <Mark_> kuudes: asset prices very much do have inflation
[12:26:53] <kuudes> if you want to make a command economy where asset prices behave as scheduled by central authority, I suppose that is fine. many people have tried such though
[12:27:22] <kuudes> but yeah, I don't think I want to have this conversation with you
[12:27:37] <kuudes> you use words as you choose and then it is hard to try to interpret if you have a point or not
[12:27:42] <kuudes> sorry, thanks
[12:27:44] <Mark_> you see, the banks, financiers, whatever people get the fed’s money first (they have to be very rich and evil people) get to spend it before the prices rise, or whatever, and the market doesn’t anticipate this and the prices of the assets aren’t appropriately sufficiently high or whatever
[12:27:54] <saturn2> not having a war sounds like a good outcome of defense spending to me
[12:28:27] <Mark_> and so even as estimated rates of general inflation are low, the relative inflation for asset prices is very high!
[12:28:47] <Mark_> obviously it would be dumb to think that the cantillon effect literally doesn’t exist or doesn’t matter at all
[12:29:27] <Mark_> but... thinking that it is the main factor (or a very important factor) responsible for the mortgage crisis or current stock prices is also dumb
[12:30:15] <Mark_> thinking that, because the cantillon effect doesn’t matter that much, there are no downsides to printing lots of money... is probably even dumber than both of these dumb things
[12:31:26] <Mark_> kuudes: I have no idea why you think inflation only has to do with consumer prices
[12:31:35] <Mark_> but that is not the case
[12:35:13] <nshepperd2> the concept of inflation for assets prices seems like a contradiction
[12:45:20] <PlanckWalk> It might be for financial assets

[12:46:30] <Robomot> I will be moving to the Netherlands
[12:46:40] <PlanckWalk> I don't see how it could be a contradiction for any other asets
[12:46:44] <Mark_> obviously asset price inflation isn’t inflation of consumer prices
[12:47:15] <Mark_> obviously, however, it involves expectations of future changes in base money
[12:48:27] <Mark_> (changes in base money including the amount of it, how much people consider it worth, whatever)
[12:49:54] <PlanckWalk> Assets are a pretty huge class of goods
[12:50:41] <PlanckWalk> It makes sense at lease to track inflation of their prices.
[12:50:59] <PlanckWalk> Even if you don't call it a "*consumer* price index"
[12:52:01] <Mark_> consumer price inflation isn’t changes in the consumer price index anyway
[12:52:17] <Mark_> that’s just one measure of inflation and not even a good one :-)

[13:41:02] <kuudes> does usa have something similar as eu bread lines?
[13:41:32] <kuudes> ie over here eu distributes overflow food produce through some charities so that you can queue and get a bag of free food
[13:41:51] <brigand> eu does what? where?
[13:42:19] <brigand> i only know of NGOs who do that
[13:43:28] <kuudes> https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1089 I think it is now part of FEAD

[13:43:57] <kuudes> well the resources come from the union
[13:44:11] <kuudes> there are charities that route private company stuff too, though
[13:44:26] <kuudes> but the original thing is union sourced afaik
[13:44:51] <kuudes> I mean, sounds better than the pouring the food to ocean, which is done as well, iirc
[13:45:53] <brigand> some is also sent to africa where it destroys local businesses
[13:47:23] <kuudes> well, food production in eu is already funded by union with cap, so the prices are already completely artificial
[13:49:18] <Mark_> subsidizing agriculture does that...
[13:50:55] <Mark_> you incentivize the farms to vastly overproduce, make sure that the prices are artificially high, put tariffs on imports to make sure the prices are even higher, then you hand out some of the overproduction for free
[13:51:23] <Mark_> I’m sure we could think of ways to make this even more inefficient
[13:52:00] <brigand> better than starving people i guess
[13:54:00] <Mark_> what makes you think agricultural subsidies cause less starvation rather than more starvation?
[13:59:52] <kuudes> amc and gamestop
[14:00:35] <kuudes> it would be awkward if we had random prices for foodstuffs because market can stay longer insane than you can survive without food
[14:00:53] <kuudes> but I guess sane people would then just have supplies for years or something

[22:18:54] <feep> github or personal gitea setup
[22:19:02] <ggreer> a lot of communities have people who chase that high. they buy a nice mechanical keyboard, then they assemble their own that's even nicer, then do it again when newer slightly better tech comes out
[22:19:05] <feep> meh, github for now
[22:19:51] <ggreer> it's a similar story for gun enthusiasts sometimes. they get a pistol, then replace most of the internals to improve trigger pull, recoil, etc. then they mill out the slide to mount an optic, then they get a weapon light, then a newer weapon light comes out that's brighter or whatever, etc
[22:20:18] <dbohdan> two2thehead: I don't think so
[22:20:23] <ggreer> by the end of it they're blowing $2k on a single gun for practically undetectable improvements (and possibly less reliability)
[22:20:43] <wilrnh> :( me when i get my license, hopefully soonish
[22:21:15] <ggreer> same deal for people who modify their cars for performance/looks

[22:25:20] <feep> hm, how can I make github syntax highlight a file with a specific language...
[22:26:33] <Mark_> gitattributes might be able to do it
