[03:32:45] <kurahaupo> eggbean: If you want to selectively colour the output of tab completion, you could start with zcomp
[03:32:45] <kurahaupo> !zcomp
[03:32:46] <greybot> For tab completion with a menu interface, install https://github.com/kurahaupo/zcomp (currently in beta test; please leave feedback on GitHub)
[03:33:41] <eggbean> kurahaupo: is that like the fancy completion on zsh??
[03:33:59] <kurahaupo> approximately, yes

[03:45:36] <eggbean> I didn't think I was bleeding edge or anything
[03:46:16] <eggbean> But this is a recent and current distro upgrade
[03:46:22] <kurahaupo> I haven't updated zcomp much since 4.something
[03:46:28] <eggbean> ic
[03:46:36] <kurahaupo> I'm using 4.4 I think

[03:48:07] <eggbean> I had a debian squeeze server running until a couple of months ago. That may have been on bash 4
[03:48:09] <kurahaupo> zcomp is compatible back to bash 3.3; forward compatibility depends on me being notified about things that are broken
[03:49:18] <emanuele6> this line is the problem: https://github.com/kurahaupo/zcomp/blob/cc06b5b1b3afff062662b452bfc527732edecda4/src/_zcomp.bash#L608
[03:49:19] <checkbot> emanuele6: I think the problem is on line 349. This printf format string has no variables. Other arguments are ignored. See 24 issues on https://shellcheck.net/?id=cb6759
[03:50:11] <kurahaupo> For most of my shell scripts I have a test suite with about 90 different bash versions, however it wasn't obvious how to automate testing of zcomp
[03:51:30] <emanuele6> because $- contains i and i is not a set option
[03:51:41] <emanuele6> surprised it used to work in 4.4

[03:52:17] <kurahaupo> yeah I suspected that as soon as you mentioned the error
[03:52:21] <emanuele6> it doesn't work on 4.4 either
[03:56:30] <kurahaupo> odd. I've updated similar lines to be simply « o=$-; … ; set -${o//[ilP]} »
[03:56:45] <kurahaupo> I wonder how/why I missed that one

[16:01:44] <FreeBDSM> hi. I have a starter.sh script that declares a few vars and then does `exec java ...`. A reduced version of the script is this: https://paste.sh/zo-ijMrb#Y-rgYT6mV1Qz6OScHWfB38sG   I have a suspicion that the problem occurs due to wrong use of quotes: there are single quotes around 3 args and I fear that java (probably quite rightfully) reads it as a single argument. How to alter the script to fix this problem?
[16:02:32] <FreeBDSM> tl;dr: `exec java '-Xms512m -Xmx2g -XX:MaxPermSize=128m' -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 workDir=/opt/myapp/data -server 'port=8080 '` should probably be: `exec java -Xms512m -Xmx2g -XX:MaxPermSize=128m -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 workDir=/opt/myapp/data -server port=8080`
[16:03:36] *** Joins: legola (~legola@46.235.101.220)
[16:04:18] <FreeBDSM> should it be `exec java "${JAVA_OPTS[@]}" ...`  instead of `exec java "${JAVA_OPTS}" \` ?
[16:05:00] <FreeBDSM> err, wait, probably not, because it's not an array, it's a string with multiple args that I want to be treated as separate args instead of 1 arg
[16:05:12] <izabera> just remove the quotes from around JAVA_OPTS

[23:04:29] <Emil> Hey
[23:04:48] <Emil> I have been recommending people use "${NAME}" for variable referencing
[23:05:07] <greycat> !varcaps
[23:05:07] <greybot> By convention, environment variables (PATH, EDITOR, SHELL, ...) and internal shell variables (BASH_VERSION, RANDOM, ...) are fully capitalized. All other variable names should be lowercase. Since variable names are case-sensitive, this convention avoids accidentally overriding environmental and internal variables. https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap08.html
[23:05:16] <Emil> and now I was asked why not just "$NAME"
[23:05:34] <neshpion> Emil: the braces add nothing in that case

[23:06:06] <cryptonector> Emil: the braces are needed in some cases, but not in that one
[23:06:12] <neshpion> Emil: although in cases where variable expansion happens inside of strings, i find it visually helpful sometimes to include the braces around the name, and it becomes mandatory when text surrounding the name consists of valid identifier chars
[23:06:34] <djph> ... but something like ${name}thing is important.

[23:12:46] <Emil> so to undesrtand it correctly
[23:13:09] <Emil> if I always use "" to wrap all variable cases, {} isn't needed ever?

[23:13:41] *** Joins: arinov (~arinov@31.142.12.211)
[23:13:43] <djph> what if you printf "$name_stuff" instead of "${name}_stuff" :)
[23:13:45] <Emil> and then error out
[23:14:03] <Emil> djph: so quotation marks don't alone resolve the issue?
[23:15:45] <neshpion> Emil: quotation marks solve word-splitting problems. braces are for fancy parameter expansion magic.  have a look in `man bash` under `/Parameter Expansion` for more information
[23:15:57] <djph> well, quotes will keep you from erroneous variable expansions by the shell (e.g. someone using spaces in filenames, and a loop of 'for f in *mp3[...]') ... but it doesn't stop the shell from interpreting non-whitespace as NOT part of the variable name (i.e. "$name"_stuff vs "${name}"_stuff.
[23:16:04] <greycat> (or FAQ 100 is you want an easier intro)
[23:16:29] <djph> and then there's all the parameter expansion magic that's brainbendy and I have to look up every. single. time

[23:19:08] <neshpion> Emil: quotations and braces solve totally separate problems, and can be used together or independently, depending on the shell behavior you need and expect.  Generally, always using quotes is desirable, and always using braces *might* be, but is far less significant than quotes, because word-splitting is a bigger pitfall than parameter expansion
[23:19:34] <Emil> thank you all! I continue to recommend always using {} with words "it's easier to always use them than to hunt for the error when you hit edge cases"
