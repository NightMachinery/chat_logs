[05:38:32] <johncs> even finding proper accounting has been hard... what i've found is wildly expensive. There's not much money flying around for me over here.
[05:42:35] <mrus> true, it is, however messing up is more expensive in the end from my experience
[05:44:47] *** Quits: x_kuru (~xkuru@user/xkuru) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[05:45:02] <johncs> what is your experience?
[05:45:08] <johncs> from what I can tell, the late fees are actually quite low
[05:45:19] <johncs> is there additional fees if they have to come after you themselves?
[05:46:02] <johncs> I'd spend many thousands paying a tax firm to do this. But each country is only owed around 1 USD, if that (not counting late fees).
[05:47:01] <mrus> 1 USD?
[05:47:49] <johncs> I'm not sure your question. Sorry. I mean my tax obligation to each country is a very low amount of money, on the order of one USA dollar.
[05:48:09] <mrus> okay, then never mind what I said
[05:48:24] <mrus> why even bother with EU customers then in first place
[05:48:59] <johncs> It's not a particularly big deal to deal with VAT now that I know about it. But unfortunately my past self didn't even know that VAT existed.
[05:49:55] <johncs> The OSS system is simple enough, and I think I'll be able to file returns easily enough from now on. But the OSS folks in Ireland said that I'd need to file any late returns with specific countries, since the OSS system doesn't handle late returns.
[05:50:21] <mrus> you're past self wasn't particularly wrong, because I believe the VAT-MOSS thing is quite new (2020?), before that there were no VAT requirements for digital services.
[05:50:52] <johncs> Ah I see. I did actually consult with some CPAs here to try to make sure I wasn't missing anything, and no one mentioned VAT
[05:50:56] <johncs> But I consulted with folks a few years ago
[05:51:05] <johncs> And only started actually taking payments last year
[05:51:16] <johncs> Makes sense that I didn't hear about it if it's so new
[05:51:21] <mrus> yeah
[05:51:54] <mrus> you probably have a non-union scheme then, I assume, since you likely don't have any hq or operations in the EU?
[05:52:08] <johncs> Correct, I do not have any operations in the EU
[05:52:13] <johncs> I'm not even incorporated
[05:52:22] <johncs> I'm just a sole proprietor in Oregon, USA selling a website

[05:55:33] <kline> bye
[05:57:09] <johncs> Haha for sure. Good to know that I better not get my OSS returns in late though, would suck to be booted from the system… would probably just have to give up on EU customers after that 😵
[05:57:41] <companion_cube> I'm amused because in the US, you always need to think about taxes even as a customer :p
[05:58:08] <mrus> I'd suggest calling any CPA in Ireland and asking. They won't charge you an arm and a leg for answering that simple question I assume.
[05:58:34] <mrus> companion_cube: why would you need to care about taxes as a consumer?
[05:58:46] <johncs> 😅 it used to be that you only had to worry about where you are when selling subscriptions, mot where your customer is
[05:59:18] <johncs> but that’s changing in the us too… fortunately I’m not over any of the states’ thresholds yet, but I probably will be before long
[05:59:20] <companion_cube> mrus: because prices in the US are displayed without the tax
[05:59:46] <johncs> That’s a good idea mrus, thank you. I wonder if they’d be able to help me.

[06:19:05] <mrus> kline: more like not exactly understanding what these taxes are
[06:19:09] <companion_cube> but also it's simpler because VAT is more or less uniform, with the exception of restaurants

[21:30:12] <doug> yeah, the convergence implies plenty of stuff came before

[21:31:36] <doug> if lisp took traits from anything, it was the mathematical representations of computing that came before it

[21:32:04] <drakonis> it is the endpoint
[21:32:22] <drakonis> that's what i mean
[21:32:56] <doug> maybe you mean "do programming languages always carcinize into something lisp-like?"
[21:33:04] <drakonis> yes
[21:33:13] <drakonis> that sounds about right
[21:33:41] <companion_cube> definitely not right syntactically
[21:34:28] <pe> All languages need a nil.
[21:34:30] * pe hides
[21:34:34] <doug> it's not uncommon that heavily used languages acquire some lisp-like features

[21:35:18] <drakonis> r7rs-large is still too far from completion
[21:37:07] <creature> pe: Sure, but I think that often I overestimate that cost. :)

[21:37:45] <pe> creature: I can't function without a custom keyboard, a particular mouse, and a specific keyboard layout.

[21:40:38] <companion_cube> nil is bad, mkay?
[21:40:52] <blu> ah splitkeyboards are where its at, been wating for a new iris that supports choc switches. Right now i use an Iris(mx)/Lily(choc). Choc switches have won me over tho.
[21:41:47] <pe> Well, I have found out that I do not care about the splitiness, but I also tested low profile Choc switches on my build and those I like a lot.
[21:43:02] <pe> It's easier to 3D print a split case though.
[21:49:56] <blu> Yeah my main thing is it being ortholinear, and then it being split. And I know the rev 5 iris has choco support but no hotswap support for switches.
[21:52:15] <pe> Hotswap support isn't all important, I think.
