[00:34:17] <blahboybaz> I'm realy new to javascript. I'm looking at this code and I see he has classes and functions in the file. And I see that some of the functions use properties found in the class definitions. But I can't tell what functions go with what class. Is there any way to tell what goes with what?
[00:36:09] <pyzozord> blahboybaz: javascript is very... flexible that way, functions are first class objects that can be passed around or even attached to other objects
[00:36:49] <pyzozord> blahboybaz: but familiarize yourself with the concept of javascript prototypes and then with the es6 class syntax
[00:38:55] <blahboybaz> pyzozord: I've been trying to diagram out the file contents; but, based on the qualities you mention, I can't figure out how to put it into a traditional class diagram. Any suggestions?

I've read some articles about it, I've watched some videos about it, and now I'm trying to break down a real life example (in this case it's someones singly linked list). I've been working on mhy own document in my own words that breaks down 
[00:44:21] <blahboybaz> what is going on in his code and part of that is I have created a couple diagrams already. Now, when it comes to diagramming the code part of it I'm kinda stuck. Is there (anyone) that would take a peek at it so we could go off the same point of reference and give me an example from that file that shows me how one of those functions is / is not connected to one of the classes it uses?

[00:44:27] <blahboybaz> tip on how that would be drawn on paper?

[00:48:27] <Hitchens> Link: Quick Analysis for the SSID Format String Bug · CodeColorist
[00:49:00] <pyzozord> blahboybaz: in the code you shared you got two classes, with a bunch of methods. Except in line 66, that is a class method, or a "static" method that is being called directly on the class object not on the object that is instance of the class
[00:49:54] <beaky> 'It concats the SSID to a format string and pass it to WFLog:message: method. Destination is 3 so it was the second xref of CFStringCreateWithFormatAndArguments that triggered the denial of service.'
[00:50:24] <beaky> gotta avoid concating untrusted strings to format strings

[00:52:53] *** Quits: Crescendo (~Crescendo@user/crescendo) (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)
[00:53:21] <beaky> so in c you got printf which is a function with a variable number of parameters depending on how many format specifiers are in the format string (the first argument) and if you name your ssid as a format string then in the apple code handling wifi on iphones it will concatenate that to the format string used by some logging mechanism thus leading to denial of service lockign up the phone's

[00:54:53] <pyzozord> beaky: yeah that is not some instrisic C security problem, that's just developer not sanitizing user input
[00:55:17] <blahboybaz> I guess what I'm really struggling with is the diagramming aspect of it. I understand how a class diagram for C or C++ would look. You list the methods in the box along with the varaibles (both bounded by the same "class" box). I kind of see what this js code is doing, it's not that, I just don't really know how to represent that in a drawing.

[01:57:28] <_73> In terms of denotational semantics, is it fair to say the solution domain of an assembly language program could be `ProgramState + Error`, where the ProgramState is the registers, stack, etc? Though this makes some sense, I dont see how side effects like a change to the file system fits into this. The only way I can think to account for such side effects would be that the solution domain is `ComputerState + Error`, but defining
[01:57:28] <_73> ComputerState would be almost impossible. Does anybody have an idea how I could define the solution domain of an assembly program?

[06:35:21] <blahboybaz> PlanckWalk: Not sure if its what you were referring to  - "..set it from anywhere.." but I though, hmm.. maybe its because the its being set via a child instance - what if I jsut eliminate that and see if it works with no child and no inheritance, just one plain class and a getter? Apparently not.. https://onecompiler.com/nodejs/3x35tx6fe  <--  But that's supposed to be exactly what a constructor 
[06:35:21] <Hitchens> Link: 3x35tx6fe - NodeJS - OneCompiler
[06:35:27] <blahboybaz> does. So even if I pass the value directly to that object it decides to not let the constructor do what a constructor does?
[06:37:54] <PlanckWalk> Using "get" and "set" explicitly say that you want assignment to call these functions.
[06:38:32] <PlanckWalk> It might be nice to be able to specify "well, I want that for get but not for set", but it's not utterly dumb without that.
[06:38:46] <PlanckWalk> Err, assignment and field access
[06:39:12] <PlanckWalk> Remember that class methods are just syntax sugar on defining functions.
[06:39:47] <blahboybaz> by "assignment" are you reffering to the constructor or something?
[06:39:59] <PlanckWalk> Anywhere
[06:40:31] <blahboybaz> You lost me (I'm, obviously, very new to the lang)
[06:40:49] <PlanckWalk> You're telling the runtime that a statement of the form "myObject.myField = whatever" should be replaced by a function call.

[09[09:29:24] <Arahael> XLST is pretty nifty for simple transforms, but it's limited.  That said, it's a nice option when you, eg, want to be able to format your document as XML, and yet, have it "viewable" by embedding an XSLT transformation.
[09:29:49] <Arahael> As eg, internet explorer can run the XSLT.
