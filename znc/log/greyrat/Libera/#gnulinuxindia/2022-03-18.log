[09:54:59] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> Hmm
[09:55:24] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> no one ate good pizza
[09:58:42] <klimi[m]> relejek[m]: Hmmm what a definition
[10:01:14] <relejek[m]> what is a good pizza? people who made it (italians) just plop a large flat bread dough, cover it with toppings of choice,a good sauce and enough cheese. all that cooked at 350-400 *C in oven, until cooked to prefered level. 
[10:08:27] <relejek[m]> ig pizza is like linux. a framework that gives it creator alot of freedom yet easy to work with unless otherwise made unnecessarily complicated. also a child can decide what they want on there pizza/linux -thus freedom of choice- but it takes bit more of expertise to make it all work by -well- a cook/coder
[10:09:51] <relejek[m]> üòÖ i hope you guys like my weird comparison of a food dish and an OS

[11:23:41] <labrador> npci?

[11:27:54] <labrador> Its not that bad then...tho I still believe it would be better if npci just made the api publicly available.
[11:29:22] <Tor[m]> We should make some laws that every government software should be opensource ( defence exempted )

[20:20:01] <razetime> heheh. I find long form writing to be more helpful. The advantage of email is that you get more time to think and respond, and that's when grammar is much easier to learn.

[21:55:05] <labrador_> Tor[m], I dunno fine? I haven't seen any other to compare anyway
[21:55:14] <labrador_> They work thats it
[21:56:58] <Tor[m]> <iamak[m]> "Mai IT se hu. And I got 6LPA..." <- Seems low lol have seniors getting 15 lpa and average of 8 
[21:57:13] <iamak[m]> Usually all old govt funded colleges hace atleast 1 lab
[21:57:14] <Tor[m]> labrador_: Meant are they old 
[21:57:17] <Tor[m]> Or new

[21:57:45] <iamak[m]> But 6LPA is standard for non campus statememts
[21:57:49] <labrador_> Feels like some of it might break on just touching
[21:57:59] <iamak[m]> s/statememts/placements/
[21:59:15] <Tor[m]> Apna medical life set hai ngl

[21:59:24] <Tor[m]> Not delhi but still
[21:59:31] <Tor[m]> Weird flex lol
[21:59:41] <labrador_> Tor[m], it feels so weird doesn't it?
[21:59:47] <labrador_> That you need to say "but still"
[21:59:57] <Tor[m]> labrador_: Oh we have relatively ok labs as far I've seen 
[22:00:13] <labrador_> Like the people who denigrate those who got into aiims should try getting into one first
[22:00:32] <labrador_> I hear a lot of people saying "Couldn't get into IIT hahahah"
[22:00:34] <labrador_> Fuckers
[22:01:20] <Tor[m]> Yeah cause everyone thinks aiims delhi but my man is better than iitB fellows
[22:01:29] <Tor[m]> I can guarantee
[22:02:00] <labrador_> eh well medical careers pay a shitton more Tor[m] 
[22:02:14] <labrador_> The downside is you start life at 30
[22:02:17] <Tor[m]> labrador_: But fucks you more
[22:02:35] <labrador_> well after you become a doctor no
[22:02:40] <labrador_> But being a resident is hard work
[22:02:48] <labrador_> Like 10hr+ shifts
[22:02:49] <labrador_> wtf
[22:02:55] <Tor[m]> Whole process is pain in ass
[22:03:00] <labrador_> ye
[22:03:25] <Tor[m]> labrador_: This is also interesting ngl but exhaustive
[22:03:52] <labrador_> hey man but cooming isn't
[22:03:53] <labrador_> hehe
[22:04:04] <Tor[m]> Like I've heard various funny and interesting cases but man they can get exhaustive
[22:05:01] <Tor[m]> Like chest compression for hours and still your patient dies or is brain dead
[22:05:12] <Tor[m]> Humbling moments
[22:05:15] <labrador_> or just touching a corpse
[22:05:18] <labrador_> Corpse
[22:05:20] <labrador_> why
[22:05:42] <Tor[m]> I did like 7 minutes on my grandfather shit broke me for months
[22:05:53] <Tor[m]> Fucking grammar
[22:06:10] <labrador_> wait you know how to give cpr?
[22:06:11] <labrador_> nice
[22:06:32] <Tor[m]> labrador_: Yes like watched house 10 times 
[22:06:32] <labrador_> Tor[m], that statement could be understood in a completely different way too
[22:06:35] <labrador_> ;)
[22:06:40] <Tor[m]> And other medical dramas
[22:06:50] <Tor[m]> labrador_: Yes that's why i rewrote it
[22:07:06] *** labrador_ is now known as labrador
[22:07:12] <Tor[m]> Tor[m]: Scrubs is second favorite then good doctor and resident 
[22:07:34] <Tor[m]> That star plus one is also kinda ok for tv serial level
[22:07:43] <Tor[m]> Tor[m]: Don't ask me how i know 
[22:08:00] <Tor[m]> Or sony i don't knwo where it plays
[22:10:53] <Tor[m]> <Tor[m]> "I did like 7 minutes on my..." <- I did cpr on my dying grandfather for 7 minutes he died :( had took months to recover 
[22:11:37] <labrador> oh sad
[22:12:00] <Tor[m]> labrador: Not really looking from now
[22:13:26] <Tor[m]> He was bed ridden for more than 5 years and he  just passed away before covid 
[22:13:26] <Tor[m]> If he was alive during covid everyone would've been suffered and him the most 
[22:13:56] <labrador> yeah I can understand
[22:15:51] <Tor[m]> Anyways have a wonderful day  and try to stop cooming

[22:21:33] <Tor[m]> This meme is from movie called full metal jacket where the protagonist private joker 
[22:21:33] <Tor[m]> He wears helmet stating born to kill but the marine goes into propoganda (media) and then in the end when he gets chance to kill a sniper lady who killed his friend and fellow marines he freezes and doesn't kill her 
[22:21:48] <Tor[m]> Anyways that's my theory
[22:22:00] <Tor[m]> Also private joker wears the peace badge
[22:23:47] <Tor[m]> Gtls gamr watch the vietnam war era movies
