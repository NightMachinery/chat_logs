[01:22:09] <xray> bookworm: It turned out the separate install of sqlite3 was a left over from a previous test. I did a complete install from scratch on a fresh image of Raspbian Bullseye without separately installing sqlite3 and it worked perfectly. I'll write up the procedure I used and post it to my web site and put a link in this channel. After I installed yarn
[01:22:09] <xray> I got a notice to upgrade npm from 8.3.1 to 8.3.2. I did that and it said there were some security issues and to run "npm audit fix" this generated an error. I had to run "npm i --package-lock-only" first and then run npm audit fix. It was all down hill after that. bookworm thank you for your help. The Lounge rocks.

[03:08:30] <Guest65> The docs kinda just tell you to configure it and setup your proxy yourself, and then with nginx you gotta go do letencrypt yourself
[03:08:40] <Guest65> would be nice if a script just pulled together all the stuff for a reasonable configuration

[06:43:07] <johncs> i'm worried it'd be solving the same problem as our LDAP implementation, which works. Though I realize it can be simpler on the admin side to just set a header.

[13:15:24] <bookworm> they will just tell you to fix your client meena
[13:15:50] <bookworm> do you run vanilla TL or some patched version / behind znc or some such?
[13:16:08] <meena> bookworm: this is fairly vanilla, lemme check what plugins i have, if any

[13:17:34] <meena> v4.3.0, no plugins
[13:20:26] <bookworm> then the only two places you can possibly make TL automatically authenticate are in the server settings via username and password in the auth section pr via the raw command field
[13:21:44] <bookworm> switch to password auth for a sec, do you see some tawr leftover there?
[13:22:15] <bookworm> I all else fails you can manually modify the user.json file, but then you need to shut down TL first
[13:23:23] <bookworm> what I don't understand is why you are even talking to nickserv, you are already identified via sasl
[13:23:59] <bookworm> in other words you sure you don't have that in the raw commands?
[13:24:06] <bookworm> it certainly looks like it
[13:24:53] <bookworm> you can grep your user.json file for tawr to see if something fishy is going on on the TL side
[13:25:07] <bookworm> then look at whatever section it's in and report back
[13:25:28] <Activ8> maybe meena3 is tawr and when the lounge tried to auth for that nick it told you that it failed meena  try changing your nick to that meena3 nick again and reconnect
[13:25:39] <Activ8> just to see if it is
[13:25:52] <bookworm> nick != account
[13:26:16] <meena> I don't have any raw commands anywhere

[13:27:14] <meena> No commands, no NickServ
[13:27:36] <bookworm> then it's not TL 🤷‍♂️ it can't invent random nicks afaik
[13:28:35] <meena> I realize there's no code on there that says auth tho tawr: https://github.com/search/advanced?q=tawr
[13:28:37] <bookworm> what are your auth settings? As in, what do you use to auth to libera? 
[13:28:54] <bookworm> cert? pw?
[13:28:54] <meena> but i have zero plugins installed, and I'm using SASL+Plain to auth to Libra
[13:29:12] <bookworm> what's in your username field?
[13:29:54] <meena> username == meena
[13:29:57] <bookworm> (and account in the sasl case)
[13:30:08] <meena> salsAccountName == meena
[13:30:18] <bookworm> then that's what TL will use
[13:30:47] <bookworm> do me a favor and boot with debug=true in the settings.json file (search for the appropriate name)
[13:31:10] <bookworm> then paste the raw traffic log of the connection, redacting where necessary
[13:31:29] <bookworm> (and by boot I mean TL restart)
[13:32:26] <meena> what's that in config.js? debug { raw: true , ircFramework: true } ?
[13:32:32] <bookworm> did you hide some second libera connection in the sidebar with custom css?
[13:32:41] <meena> nope

[15:03:18] <d76d5436757> bookworm: I'd prefer to not implement fido or oauth in this for a few reasons. First, it's complex to implement either protocol (and there will inevitably be the requests to support SAML or a different protocol or whatever). Second, TL is usually used behind a reverse proxy anyway. Implementing SSO at the Nginx / Apache level is already supported
[15:03:18] <d76d5436757> (and this would also allow the users to use HTTP basic auth or whatever else for authentication). Using the REMOTE_USER header is a lot more flexible and simpler to implement, at the cost of more difficulty for the end user to set up. However, if the end user has the capability to set up SSO, then they likely already know how to set up HTTP auth on
[15:03:18] <d76d5436757> the reverse proxy level. This is a niche feature, so I would like to make sure that it works with as many implementations as possible to prevent undue work.

[15:21:05] <bookworm> the point of implementing ldap in the first palace was to basically defer to that, meaning you should be able to write a keybase ldap adapter no?
[15:21:13] <bookworm> place*
[15:22:10] <bookworm> or does this not support your SSO constraint?
[15:30:00] <d76d5436757> HTTP basic auth is just an example of something that uses the REMOTE_USER header. SSO implementations on Apache or Nginx are much more secure and work on the same functionality: passing a server-side header to the application

[15:30:49] <d76d5436757> I'd prefer not to use LDAP since it isn't true SSO: you have to log in again every time you load TF. Compared to SSO: sign in once and all the apps are signed in
[15:37:25] *** Joins: alex11 (~alex11@user/alex11)
[15:38:40] <bookworm> basic auth doesn't have a relationship to REMOTE_USER as per the spec btw... your reverse proxy may add that but it's not exactly in a standard document as far as I can tell
[15:40:00] <bookworm> I get what you are asking for, but I think it might be easier to fit this in the plugin system rather that arbitrarily choose a format you happen to like
[15:40:31] <bookworm> over any other protocol mentioned, oauth, fido, jwts...
[15:49:07] <d76d5436757> Alright. I'll do some more research and get back to you on that. Thanks for the help!

[16:28:28] <bookworm> looking at our auth code this can get tricky as we aren't actually doing proper requests but websocket calls with our own protocol... meaning as soon as you've fetched the app once you aren't actually getting any proper headers anymore (in an installed pwa at least)
