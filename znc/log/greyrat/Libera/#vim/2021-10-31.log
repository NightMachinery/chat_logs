[00:20:01] <jcbjoe2021> So I’m a noob at vim and love learning it. One question I have is say I have two lines and I’m at the beginning or in the middle of the first line. I try to press k or down to go down to the second line but it won’t go for some reason. I have to press A to get to the end is there a faster way to go to the second line?
[00:20:39] <romainl> k is up
[00:21:38] <romainl> jcbjoe2021: do  :set number
[00:22:02] <romainl> jcbjoe2021: is there a line number for each line?
[00:22:58] <romainl> show us a screenshot if unsure
[00:23:28] <jcbjoe2021> I get k and j mixed up I already know h is left and l is right
[00:23:38] <romainl> don't bother
[00:23:50] <romainl> just use your arrows
[00:24:28] <jcbjoe2021> Ok I will. Yes learning those keys is like a whole different world
[00:25:11] <jcbjoe2021> romainl: I did set number and it looks the second line is still the first line. I thought it was two lines
[00:25:40] <romainl> you have soft-wrapping  on
[00:25:47] <romainl> no big  deal

[00:54:51] <jcbjoe2021> romainl: how long you been using vim?
[00:55:44] <romainl> ~11-12 years, doesn't mean a thing
[00:56:20] <jcbjoe2021> romainl: that means you know what your doing. Does it mean that even though you use it a lot there is more to learn?
[00:56:53] <romainl> there is always more to learn
[00:57:51] <romainl> but the goal is to learn enough of $TOOL to make it effectively disappear, not to learn all of it or whatever

[01:48:38] <DixieFlatline> I'm drawing a blank. Isn't there a way to save your current settings but with some limitations? Same thing for session (viminfo) and is there a one for highlighting / :hl or colorscheme as well? Hmm...

[01:50:39] <romainl> there's nothing for colorschemes beyond dumping the output of :hi AFAIK
[01:52:51] <DixieFlatline> one should do binds and ah... session stores buffers and global variables; I think there are some variables to control what :mkvimrc might or might not save.
[01:53:30] <romainl> imagine if those were mentioned in those commands' help section
[01:53:37] <DixieFlatline> Nothing for colorscheme / highlight; and to load vim commands from everything? is :source

I think a regular terminal would have flushed the previous lines while vim kept them all in memory. still that was 100% my fuck up :P
[16:52:02] <LordRishav> The thing I hate about :term most is that it doesn't have scrollback :(

I dislike distribution files (like vim syntax/etc runtime files), monolith way, because often when I'm really into on some language, and that's mostly the case when opening vim/nvim for me, I have those "sane fallbacks" wholly replaced by enhanced language support grabbed
[17:22:39] <vvdaiwrw> from the web, so they're worthless, and that's even worse with lsp confs like nvim-lspconfig does, or worse even more with their "lsp installer recipes".

I had to get rid of several plugins in the past because they constantly took control of my quickfix or location list. other plugins added unusual autocommands that would internally switch windows (tagbar

[19:01:24] <romainl> basically, you can't expect to be able to use Vim correctly without _some_ learning but learning takes time and effort and you want to use right here and right now so you take all kinds of shortcuts which, in fine, give you a very fancy tool that you don't know and… even more to learn: Vim + each plugin
[19:02:11] *** Joins: jochum (~quassel@user/jochum)
[19:02:51] <yolo_> learning is: first you do addition(Plugs), then you start to do subtraction(removing fat), then you get fit. I need remove many plugins indeed
[19:02:53] <romainl> plugins are fine, we all have some, but the most empowering part of all this is Vim itself, which should be any user's #1 focus

[19:04:44] <romainl> Vim already has file explorer built-in and linting and formatting are generally doable without ALE
[19:05:57] <yolo_> no way to run clang-format inside vim without ALE for my c/c++ code as far as I know
[19:06:07] <yolo_> i mean, automatically at saving time
[19:06:29] <romainl> you can literally anything at save time

[19:07:01] <zeraphel> 1: use plugins & learn vim, 2: learn vimscript & remove plugins, 3: write vimscript, 4: clean vimrc rewriting functions as plugins, 5: learn enough vim to not need your own plugins, 6: publish!
