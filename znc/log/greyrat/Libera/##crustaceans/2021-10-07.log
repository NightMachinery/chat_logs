[00:16:09] <phil> ngoldbaum: No, Intel.
[00:17:03] <phil> Installed other OSen on ARM chromebooks is extremely hit/miss, as ARM platforms vary so much & support is probably tied to some random wildly out of date Linux kernel that was last hacked into shape by the SoC designer in 2017
[00:17:51] <phil> Anyway. emacs, git, gcc & ghc & tmux. What more does a real hacker (tm) need?

[00:34:42] <gwozniak> ngoldbaum: Each machine has a different tmux session, so I put them in different tabs and use a keybinding to connect to them
[00:35:34] <ngoldbaum> ah so you’re not differentiating between themes or whatever just the connection details
[00:35:57] <ngoldbaum> i just do “ssh mymachine” and have the hostname in my prompt
[00:36:30] <ngoldbaum> thanks for explaining
[00:37:23] <gwozniak> I just appreciate the keybindings for quick connecting to some machine

[07:28:20] <manicennui> A few years ago my father was dumb enough to buy a house and move in with my brother and his family.
[07:28:21] <imode> sounds vaguely familiar.
[07:28:23] <manicennui> That lasted 6 months.
[07:29:06] <manicennui> Fortunately I never grew attached to them and just consider them another fucked up white trash family that I can't do anything about.
[07:29:41] <manicennui> I'm surprised that my brother is still alive frankly.
[07:29:59] <manicennui> He is one of those people who thinks he is tough and feels the need to start shit.
[07:30:03] <imode> my white trash family killed my grandparents, ransacked their estate and blamed my mother for killing her/getting in the way of them getting her social security after they put my grandmother in a subpar nursing home.
[07:30:06] <manicennui> He has had skull fractures from having his ass beat.
[07:30:27] <dimadima> you mean literally killed them like homicide?
[07:30:35] <imode> elderly neglect is homicide.
[07:30:40] <dimadima> sure
[07:31:03] <imode> they effectively cornered her off, left her alone (she can't walk, can't feed herself, and had dimentia) for stretches of time, collected her social security checks.
[07:31:14] <manicennui> Most of my family serves as an example of what not to do.
[07:31:24] <imode> the real shame is that she was the first female postmaster in the state in her age. she was a titan.
[07:31:32] <imode> she raised children, who turned out to be demons.
[07:31:39] <imode> save for my mother.
[07:31:45] <imode> people like that exist everywhere.
[07:31:58] <imode> every family has a branch of the tree that honestly could just be cut off and left to die, which we did.
[07:32:14] <dimadima> what's with that
[07:32:16] <dimadima> just people?
[07:32:27] <Church> I thankfully only have the one
[07:32:34] <manicennui> I think fully formed, good people are pretty rare.
[07:32:35] <imode> now a majority of them have some kind of cancer and I'm savoring their last moments as their kids neglect and exploit them just as they did to their parents.
[07:32:36] <dimadima> that does seem to happen. my wife's mom has 8 siblings and half of her siblings are like that more or less
[07:32:40] <Church> My aunt Tracy is in bumfuck somewhere
[07:32:44] <manicennui> We attribute too many positive traits to humans.
[07:32:50] <Church> Fuck if I know where or care
[07:32:56] <imode> I'm not a good person but I want my family to have a good life.
[07:33:03] <Church> I did just get back in touch a bit with the folks on my dad's side
[07:33:03] <manicennui> I get it, we are animals who want to survive just like every other creature.
[07:33:05] <imode> no need to conflate the two.
[07:33:06] <Church> Which was nice.
[07:33:11] <manicennui> But we think too highly of ourselves.
[07:33:16] <imode> Church: was the contact prolonged?
[07:33:20] <Church> I mean I'm a golden god
[07:33:22] <dimadima> my wife's aunt stole all the plastic ware from her father's house
[07:33:24] <Church> imode: Eh one dinner
[07:33:28] <imode> heh.
[07:33:31] <Church> I took a weekend trip to Seattle
[07:33:34] <dimadima> when they were moving him into a nursing home
[07:33:36] <Church> To see my pop
[07:33:50] <Church> dimadima: Why...
[07:34:09] <dimadima> Church: cause she's crazy? she took paper towlels, all the stupid shit ppl buy from walmart
[07:34:14] <dimadima> she's not poor
[07:34:35] <Church> Fair enough
[07:34:44] <dimadima> i don't know really, heonstly. that's what i'm wondering
[07:34:50] <manicennui> When my grandmother (mother's side) moved in with my uncle and sold her house, her daughter told her that she could give her her money now.
[07:34:58] <dimadima> manicennui's insight is that fully formed ppl are rare. i feel that
[07:35:06] <manicennui> As if my grandmother owed her daughter an inheritance.
[07:35:19] <manicennui> And shouldn't use the money for herself.
[07:35:33] <manicennui> It wasn't even that much money.
[07:35:37] <imode> my wife's father cheated on her mother while he was deployed, leaving her with two kids. mother has no good taste in people, chased "love" and bounced around between boyfriends and the street, leaving my wife to take care of her two young brothers. she's got scoliosis, neurofibromatosis, severe malnutrition side-effects, exposure to second-hand smoke...
[07:36:01] <imode> I struggle to fathom how we both aren't raving psychopathic nutjobs who steal from everyone.
[07:36:22] <imode> why did we develop a conscience.
[07:36:36] <dimadima> any ideas imode?
[07:36:47] <imode> no fuckin' clue. genetic or environmental lottery.
[07:37:00] <imode> I struggle to see how my _parents_ were such good people compared to the places they came from.
[07:37:41] <imode> they're both in their sixties now. I pay their bills, mom never earned over $60k, dad destroyed his body working in power plants.
[07:37:51] * imode sips tea.
[07:37:56] <manicennui> Just had the right experiences at the right moments maybe.
[07:38:09] <imode> something in me says empathy is some sort of hard-to-acquire trait.
[07:38:24] <imode> and that the supply of it is slowly dwindling as time passes.
[07:38:29] <imode> and I don't know the force behind that decline.
[07:38:31] <manicennui> I feel the most empathy for kitties.
[07:38:50] <manicennui> Total sucker for videos on YT where a cat is rescued and lives happily ever after.
[07:39:08] <imode> the cynic in me asks why they were filming and how the cat got there.
[07:39:25] <imode> trust nobody that doesn't post videos filmed in a panic.
[07:39:30] <manicennui> No idea. Seems to be a popular thing to do.
[07:39:46] <imode> yeah. there are cases where people put cats/kittens in those situations to farm reputation.
[07:39:46] <dimadima> i could be limiting my concepts around the issues of our day, but i feel like the pervasive "story" culture we live in leads people to conceptualize of themselves are characters in a narrative which leads to some sort of mass detachment
[07:39:56] <manicennui> There are definitely many channels run by people who rescue animals.
[07:40:07] <imode> dimadima: I definitely have an internal narrative, but I don't treat that as the only plot thread.
[07:40:34] <imode> manicennui: sure. but I'm always skeptical any time I see stuff like that.
[07:40:36] <manicennui> But this channel is full of happy endings: https://www.youtube.com/user/TheDodoSite/videos
[07:40:36] <buttsbot> The Dodo - YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/user/TheDodoSite/videos
[07:40:58] <imode> it's kind of sad, because you want to take something at face value. but with the reputation/attention economy the way it is these days, you can't, because someone's gaming it.
[07:41:01] <imode> someone's always gaming it.
[07:41:10] <imode> you never know who's an actual human being.
[07:41:28] <imode> or whether some channel for good will will be sold out from under you to someone else
[07:41:39] <manicennui> This is a guy who rescues cats: https://www.youtube.com/c/FlatbushCats/videos
[07:41:39] <buttsbot> Flatbush Cats - YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/c/FlatbushCats/videos
[07:42:23] <imode> usually I try to flock to people with no incentive to exploit emotional response.
[07:42:38] <manicennui> YT tricked me recently though. It recommended this long video about this cat that was rescued, and at the end it was getting better, but the woman said it needed surgeries.
[07:42:51] <manicennui> So I go to her channel and look for updates. The cat died after surgery. =(
[07:43:00] <Church> Boooh
[07:43:21] <imode> ouchie. same happened to me watching someone rescue bats.
[07:43:23] <manicennui> He was looking much better too.
[07:43:26] <imode> cute little buggers.
[07:44:41] <manicennui> About the only videos with kids that get me are the ones where some kid gets adopted by people who seem to truly care about them.
[07:45:10] <imode> that kind of overtly positive stuff just triggers the bullshit reflex in my brain.
[07:45:16] <imode> and man that's not healthy but it is a survival instinct.

[07:45:42] <buttsbot> The best Adoption surprise compilation that will melt your heart | All Things Internet - YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=newcGtIvSyU
[07:45:46] <manicennui> Try to make it through that.
[07:45:46] <imode> "someone's posting this from someone else in order to farm reputation." "someone staged this scenario."
[07:45:51] <imode> yeah that's kind of my point.
[07:46:01] * dimadima amens everything imode is writing
[07:46:09] <imode> nobody posted that because they were wanting to share a wonderful moment with you.
[07:46:16] <imode> they were posting that because they want to exploit your emotional response.
[07:46:38] <imode> so that they can gain ad revenue from you and sell the analytics to other people.
[07:47:10] <imode> emotional response casts such a wide net over the... net, because everybody reacts to it roughly the same way.
[07:47:38] <imode> it's like, the ultimate "bland" content. you'll get views any time someone reaches for cute cat videos.
[07:47:45] <dimadima> imode:  what "channels for positive" have you seen sold out to bad people
[07:47:49] <dimadima> if any come to mind
[07:48:23] <imode> none at the moment but it's not that hard to trace who's advertising to who and why and where these links end up.
[07:48:43] <imode> the funny bunny videos aren't the content they want to serve, the ads are the content.
[07:48:48] <imode> the analytics are the byproduct.
[07:49:07] <imode> all of this is moot if you run an adblocker but for the majority of people that's not the case.
[07:49:18] <dimadima> this is why i hate big tech more and more
[07:49:25] <imode> same for the memes and shit that are spread around social media.
[07:49:32] <dimadima> it's just turning brands into people and people into brands
[07:49:57] <dimadima> and no one can tell the two apart anymore
[07:49:59] <dimadima> myself included
[07:50:06] <imode> hence why I focus on tech, news and the occasional comedy.
[07:51:03] <imode> hard to manipulate that apart from spinning the news, and with news you at least have multiple sources you can use to sniff out BS.
[07:51:16] <dimadima> i can't deal w/ the news myself
[07:51:32] <imode> like, operation earnest voice should've been the last straw for people.
[07:51:39] <imode> but nobody knows about it so who cares.
[07:52:13] <dimadima> i just learned about it (reading)
[07:53:16] *** Joins: cd (moony@hellomouse/dev/moony)
[07:53:31] <dimadima> doesn't seem too different from voice of america?
[07:53:36] <dimadima> just more, uh, internet-age?
[07:53:59] <imode> VOA is at least a centralized, known broadcaster.
[07:54:08] <imode> you have no idea whether you'd interact with a sockpuppet or not.
[07:54:14] <dimadima> hehe yeah that's what i meant, euhpemistically, by "internet-age"
[07:54:32] <dimadima> sarcastically
[07:54:34] <imode> heh.
[07:54:47] <imode> on the internet, nobody knows you're the government.
[07:54:54] <imode> or some other private party.
[07:55:35] <imode> so it's hard to get excited about.. anything, I guess, when it comes to "stuff done on the internet in tandem with other people". communities like lobste.rs seem to be holding up really well.
[07:56:14] <dimadima> imode why did you select OEV of all things to be the last straw?
[07:57:12] <imode> iirc it was one of the first operations that targeted social media. you can recognize propaganda in the large but you can't recognize it in the small.
[07:57:39] <imode> that people publically knew about.

[08:00:30] <buttsbot> There was a shooting at my school today : teenagers
[08:00:38] <manicennui> 'Merica! Fuck yeah!
[08:01:05] <imode> considering how badly the shooter got fucked up prior in a fight that nobody interrupted, I'm not surprised at the reaction.
[08:01:11] <manicennui> So after being scared out of their minds by a shooter, they have to be scared out of their minds by the fucking cops.
[08:01:16] <dimadima> i really relate to postman's phenomenology
[08:02:23] <dimadima> social media is all of this on steroids, but i think this all started with television
[08:03:10] <imode> three rules to dominate a population/market share. proliferate, consolidate, addict.
[08:03:28] <imode> get into everyone's heads, lead them all to the same place, lock them in feedback loops they don't want to get out of.
[08:03:41] <imode> repeat for any industry and you'll be a billionaire in 5 years.

[08:16:26] <bkero> and culpable of aiding and abetting?
[08:17:15] <manicennui> Can't you see? Carmack is trying to bring them down from the inside, with the power of Racket.
[08:18:21] <imode> I respect Carmack for what he's done. can't say I find his code particularly enthralling.
[08:18:48] <imode> but I still play doom.
[08:19:02] <imode> maybe that's more of romero's influence than carmack's.
[08:25:03] <dimadima> bkero: i dont know that's a tough question isn't it? it's both hard to judge and easy to judge
[08:25:17] <dimadima> with a person like carmack it seems easier to judge
[08:25:49] <dimadima> you'd think he didn't have to work there
[08:25:55] <dimadima> he kind of strikes me as a sociopath though
[08:27:45] <dimadima> maybe "sociopath" isn't exactly the word

[17:23:34] <dimadima> this happened with my wife's parents when her dad retired. her mom was a homemaker and now they kind of drive each other crazy it seems
[17:23:58] <dimadima> was/is a homemaker heh i guess they never retire

People seem to be of the opinion that the problem is that the characters are close together on the keyboard, when the issue really is that it's really easy to do destructive operations without meaning to do them explicitly. Even if the destructive operation was on a key on the other side of the keyboard, you could conceivably mistakenly hit it for some reason, while it's much more difficult to type out "delete" or "
[18:02:59] <Brekkjern> set" as a mistake.

[20:09:04] <manicennui> I had a warehouse job where I worked 4 10-hour days, but we often worked overtime.

[20:09:32] <manicennui> There weren't good ways to goof off.
[20:09:32] <Church> So I guess the question is, manual or mental work?
[20:09:41] <manicennui> And we basically worked until all orders were pulled and packed for the day.
[20:09:46] <Church> Manual I guess yeah. But generally because you're watched like a hawk
[20:09:59] <indigo> I guess I was thinking about mental work
[20:10:46] <manicennui> I've worked with people who seemed to never goof off, but I don't think they did it because they were better workers.
[20:10:51] <manicennui> They did it because it took them longer to do things.

[21:31:40] <dimadima> companion_cube: well they were ridiculous and only recently let you use that platform for free to no end basically
[21:31:46] <dimadima> ppl used docker hub for CI and shit
[21:32:37] <dimadima> it's just funny how quickly the community (redhat, google, microsoft) got together and totally standardized docker out of existence
[21:33:11] <manicennui> The problem is that docker never actually did that much. It would have been best as an open source project and nothing else.
[21:33:13] <dimadima> manicennui: they didn't even have a couple years
[21:33:34] <manicennui> dimadima: They have been in business for a decade now.

[21:35:47] <dimadima> companion_cube: yeah i think its' pretty thin

[21:36:06] <companion_cube> ah I guess there's all the networking stuff, too
[21:36:21] <dimadima> yes, yes, the networking stuff too
[21:37:01] <manicennui> dimadima: They were apparently a YC startup in 2011.
[21:37:10] <manicennui> The product wasn't released until 2013.
[21:37:17] <dimadima> manicennui: but they pivoted hard to docker
[21:37:42] <dimadima> they were a hosting company that used this tool internally and then the tool proved super popular
[21:38:30] <manicennui> Sure, but the company existed and they were working on the tool.
[21:38:48] <dimadima> 2013 was around the time lots of SaaSs started containerziing internally and docker made that their product
[21:38:56] <dimadima> that's true yes
[21:39:05] <manicennui> The point is they first took money in 2011.
[21:39:12] <dimadima> yes
[21:39:26] <manicennui> Their series A was also in 2011.
[21:39:45] <dimadima> yeah i think their hosting business was not unsuccessful
[21:40:06] <dimadima> i should have said PaaSs
[21:40:09] <manicennui> They have raised $330 million total.
[21:40:56] <dimadima> that's so much
[21:41:04] <manicennui> $330 million for what should be an open source tool and nothing more.
[21:41:27] <dimadima> which is what it is
[21:41:40] <dimadima> and i think why using it feels a bit like piracy :)
[21:41:48] <manicennui> I'm sure they have paying customers for the non-free version of their tools.
[21:42:09] <dimadima> yeah, some for sure, but they dont turn profit
[21:42:10] <manicennui> I don't see it that way at all, and couldn't care less about whether they survive.

[21:45:42] <manicennui> I don't get it.
[21:45:50] <manicennui> But it isn't unusual.
[21:46:21] <dimadima> do they make the cleaning peopel wear shits that say "do waht you love"?
[21:46:31] <dimadima> shirts, even
[21:46:38] <manicennui> Our cleaning people aren't employees of our company.
[21:46:47] <manicennui> They don't make people do anything generally.
[21:47:23] <dimadima> i'm sure wework's weren't either
[21:47:43] <manicennui> They might have been. Don't they own the buildings?

[21:47:55] *** Joins: buttsbot (~buttsbot@31.187.71.242)
[21:48:03] <manicennui> I think our cleaning people work for the building.
[21:48:05] <dimadima> no one optimizing profit employs janitors
[21:48:23] <dimadima> i don't thnik wework owns most of their buildings. they lease
[21:51:11] <dimadima> < manicennui> "While he didn’t share specific numbers, Johnston indicated that annual recurring revenue (ARR) grew 170% last year"
[21:51:16] <dimadima> well that's good, maybe i'll stop feeling bad
[21:51:19] <dimadima> :)
[21:52:11] <indigo> Nice, my wife has the option of a 10-4 schedule
[21:52:12] <manicennui> "In October 2019, Neumann received close to $1.7 billion from stakeholder SoftBank for stepping down from WeWork's board and severing most of his ties to the company.[12] He was retained as a consultant with an annual salary of $46 million.[13]"
[21:52:14] <manicennui> Nice.
[21:52:27] <manicennui> Why are people so upset that someone ripped off VC?
[21:52:58] <dimadima> my guess is there's something really specifically detestable about him
[21:53:05] <companion_cube> cause this guy is an insufferable piece of shit
[21:53:05] <dimadima> indigo: nice how does that work?
[21:53:11] <companion_cube> who thinks he's god on earth
[21:53:18] <indigo> dimadima: 10 hours a day, four days a week
[21:53:20] <manicennui> Okay.
[21:53:29] <manicennui> I've never had to interact with him, so I'm not sure why I would care.
[21:53:30] <dimadima> indigo: oh that is cool. is she going to take it
[21:53:58] <dimadima> it's the kind of thing that translates to cleaning people wearing shirts that say "do what you love"
[21:54:03] <manicennui> I'm sure many of the VCs that were fucked are also insufferable pieces of shit.
[21:54:15] <dimadima> that's true
[21:54:31] <manicennui> I doubt the cleaning people were terribly worried about the shits they wore to clean.
[21:54:48] <manicennui> Were they paid well? Were their benefits good?
[21:55:09] <dimadima> those are the practical questions
[21:55:30] <indigo> I think she's going to try it
[21:55:34] <indigo> Always worth it to try something
[21:55:45] <indigo> Well, most of the time. I probably won't try fentanyl ;)
[21:56:49] <dimadima> manicennui: i do tend to dwell/focus on symbolic things like what they're wearing. i find it hard to imagine a person is treated well generally if they're subject to that treatment
[21:56:58] <dimadima> indigo: i hear a lot of people like that
[21:57:12] <dimadima> it can be really hard if you're a nurse or something. a few nurse friends of mine do that
[21:57:18] <manicennui> dimadima: I find it hard to imagine that many cleaning people are treated well period.
[21:57:30] <dimadima> true
[21:57:37] <manicennui> I get it.
[21:58:02] <manicennui> I just think it's much easier for nothing to be done when we focus on the aspects that barely matter.
[21:58:09] <manicennui> But it is great for social media outrage.
[21:58:21] <manicennui> Then we can move on to the next outrage.
[21:58:24] <indigo> dimadima: Thankfully she is doing knowledge work
[21:58:34] <manicennui> Symbolic outrage about symbolic wrongs.
[21:58:55] <companion_cube> manicennui: the wework guy is also easy to hate because he's an arrogant prick who oversold everyone (but mostly his investors)
[21:59:03] <companion_cube> so I guess the SEC should be the most upset one :)
[21:59:12] <manicennui> companion_cube: I don't really care if people fool VCs.
[21:59:22] <manicennui> If they do something illegal, charge them.
[21:59:38] <manicennui> But we know that they generally aren't.
[21:59:43] <companion_cube> fooling VCs can be illegal
[21:59:47] <manicennui> Sure.
[22:00:47] <manicennui> Seems like investors think he just mismanaged things.
[22:01:06] <companion_cube> possibly.
[22:01:11] <manicennui> Being bad at one's job isn't illegal.
[22:01:19] <companion_cube> Elizabeth Holmes, though…
[22:01:52] <manicennui> Sure, she actually committed fraud though.
[22:02:20] <companion_cube> yeah, I think the wework guy probably didn't _lie_ to investors
[22:02:25] <dimadima> manicennui:  well no you're right actually. did i think about how much they were being paid? would i have cared if they wore standard uniforms? they would have probably just been more invisible people
[22:02:34] <companion_cube> he was just having delusions of greatness
[22:04:14] <ngoldbaum> being bad at your job isn’t illegal but failing at your fiduciary responsibilities can be
[22:04:44] <ngoldbaum> or at least expose you to liability in a manner that might pierce the corporate veil
[22:10:03] <manicennui> I don't see any claims that he did so.
[22:10:26] <manicennui> Seems like they just didn't believe that his plan was good and that he was generally doing a bad job.
[22:10:59] <manicennui> Whether they should have known about certain things before the S-1 is a valid question.
[22:11:15] <manicennui> Seems like they just bought him out.
[22:38:56] <kline> phil, so the bike battery was so low the smart charger id gotten hold of wouldnt recognise it
[22:39:34] <kline> after work i got my mate to "jump start" just the battery for 20 mins and then i plugged it - the charger reports it as having been charged to ~10V and now is taking it the rest of the way
[22:39:43] <kline> no idea how much charge itll actually hold though
[22:59:32] <ngoldbaum> e-bike or more like a moped?
[23:08:09] <kline> tiger 800xc
[23:23:28] <ngoldbaum> oh like a real motorcycle nice
[23:38:21] <kline> yeah
[23:38:38] <kline> turn the igntion to 9 oclock to engage the steering lock
[23:38:52] <kline> turn it one click more to 8 oclock to turn on the parking lights
[23:39:23] <kline> guards called me when i was 100mi up the highway to tell me there was a bike registered to me with its lights on, did i want to pop over the campus to turn it off?
