[08:54:04] <Emil> How can I preserve bottom padding even if the display is too small to show all content? I have overflow: scroll
[08:55:56] <Emil> but even with overflow scroll bottom padding just goes away which has been a dagger in my head for quite some time now
[08:57:52] <Emil> And no, this isn't margin collapsing, it's fucking padding collapsing
[08:59:08] <Emil> https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=748518 or is this just a "lol we haven't fixed this in many years now issue"

[14:06:29] <FightingFalcon> ok
[14:08:37] <DPA> If you make the body "display: flex; flex-direction: column;", you can put the header at the very end of the page using a high order number "order: 10000;", then you can continue using "position: sticky;". Not sure if it's worth it, though.
[14:08:37] <DPA> Not sure about the text longer than div thing. May have something todo with all the flex boxes & how they interact.
