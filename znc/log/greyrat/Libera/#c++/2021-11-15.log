[01:44:45] <edman007_> Hi, so question, I'm using a C library, it lets me give it a function pointer, f= int(int), where I don't have control of the only argument, I want to pass a pointer to something that does something a bit more advanced (noteably, do something that depends on the object state which is NOT passed in this API), I can use std::bind() to make an std:function that does what I want, but my google foo says I can't convert that to a C function pointer? Is there
[01:44:45] <edman007_> another way to do this?
[01:46:18] <anyone> global singleton

[01:46:54] *** Joins: rgrinberg (~textual@190.113.102.153)
[01:47:09] <anyone> I can't think of any way that it would not be singular
[01:47:38] <anyone> Especially if the function being called does not take custom pointers
[01:47:46] <ville> if that state was an int, you could still have other int instances

[01:53:47] <edman007_> hrm...but can that be done with multiple different states in parallel? since the goal is I have N objects in a threaded application, each calling the same API but with different arguments, does a global singleton get me N different function pointers that do N different things?
[01:54:44] <anyone> ville: like when there's some stupid void transform_some_array(ArrayOfInts *a, size_t n, int (*transform)(int)).
[01:54:47] <RandomReader> if the API doesn't supply any data that would let you distinguish the context for the call, there isn't any way for it to be magically added
[01:55:09] <anyone> then the function you're giving in just sees the elements of 'a', and has no other way to access anything except one global thing
[01:55:12] <ville> forget the term singleton. you just "want", or rather are forced to, have some global or translation-unit-local state
[01:55:16] <edman007_> really the API calls F with an array of ints and I have to pick one and return it, it's threaded, in parrallel, and on different objects I want to pick a different one
[01:55:17] <RandomReader> (side note: you'll want to make sure it supports multithreading at all .. if it doesn't explicitly say it does, assume it doesn't and probably has internal global state)
[01:55:20] <anyone> yeah perhaps dependent upon the value of some a[i], but you rarely want that
[01:55:40] <anyone> edman007_: show the code or it didn't happen
[01:56:08] <ville> anyone: still does not need to be singleton
[01:57:21] <ville> anyone: you/he get to control the function which pointer is passed. it can access as much of global state as needed. there's no requirement for singleton pattern to be involved
[01:57:44] <anyone> fact is that function needs to access some fixed place

[01:58:40] <cbreak> :(
[01:58:49] <anyone> C interface. Probably doesn't know thread_local.
[01:59:03] <cbreak> thread_local doesn't influence the interface
[01:59:32] <ville> you make the "global" thread_local
[01:59:33] <anyone> C code then. Really the entire question is a C question.
[01:59:41] <ville> it's not
[01:59:44] <cbreak> you could maybe synthesize a custom function pointer instead of bind, but that'd be highly platform specific, with runtime code gen
[02:00:07] <cbreak> not really c++ standard
[02:00:13] <ville> or if you wish you can have a hash table as your global state, and look the "thread local" state with your thread id
[02:00:54] <cbreak> your C API doesn't give any indication of identity at all?

[04:17:21] <Budd> I'm writing C++ for a Pico microcontroller. When I introduce a std::vector, my compiled image grows from 50 kB to 145 kB. The code is being compiled (gcc) with -fno-exceptions and -fno-rtti. Any suggestions on how to keep things small?

[04:18:24] <Budd> Looking at the list of added symbols, it seems that there are many related to stack unwinding and exceptions.

[04:19:36] <Budd> -O3 (default for the pico-sdk environment)
[04:19:42] <vvdaiwrw> must be as 145kB is pretty slim, just not for pico
[04:20:13] <vvdaiwrw> I'd go for C instead of fighting a compilation system...

[05:07:28] <RandomReader> sorry, you don't have to worry about std::memcpy dereferencing
[05:07:40] <RandomReader> std::copy is not special and you would always need correct types

[05:08:11] <svm_invictvs> No, I get an array of structs. I want to copy that to byte array to write to disk.
[05:08:32] <RandomReader> no, std::copy copies objects from iterators, it has nothing to do with bytes, trivial types make no difference
[05:08:38] <RandomReader> std::memcpy deals with storage/bytes
[05:08:40] <svm_invictvs> Oh, okay
[05:08:47] <svm_invictvs> Well
[05:08:55] <svm_invictvs> std::memcpy works for now.

[05:11:45] <svm_invictvs> My next step after I get this PR done is to go in and just make the Image class deal with unsigned bytes and have a format and pixel depth flag.
[05:12:20] <svm_invictvs> The only reason it uses this is that the original author wanted to "simplify" it by using sizeof(BGRA) to represent 4 byte pixel depth.

[05:14:36] <svm_invictvs> What's realy dumb is that nowhere does this part of the code ever do any image processing. It doesn't care if the pixel format is BGRA, RGBA, or even what the pixel values do. It literally reads the image from one source, uses a bunch of OS calls to get it in the right format (BGRA) then hands it to another piece of code for downstream processing.
[05:15:07] <svm_invictvs> There is no logical reason it has to try to make sense of the image, other than it's primitive byte-by-byte format. Like it has a bunch of needless UB

[13:44:36] <cbreak> why store the coordinate of something in a grid?
[13:44:53] <cbreak> you know where it is already because you looked it up in a grid
[13:45:01] <cbreak> also, why use tuple of bool? Use a proper struct
[13:45:31] <cbreak> there you might even be able to use bit fields, if you're eager to make things space efficient, but at least you can use proper names, to make the code nicely readable
[13:47:54] <anyone> at that point one could ask why stdlib return std::pair<>s at all, if it could just be named nicely
[13:50:00] *** Quits: ania123 (~ania123@212.72.140.51) (Quit: Client closed)
[13:51:05] <cbreak> anyone: yeah. I've asked myself the same thing.
[13:51:07] <ville> because it sidesteps the most difficult part of it: naming them properly
[13:51:24] <cbreak> honestly, what is the meaning of first and second in std::map?
[13:51:31] *** Quits: Atque (~Atque@user/atque) (Quit: ...)
[13:52:01] <cbreak> answer: first is the iterator, second is a bool that tells you if insertion worked
[13:52:32] <ville> the "problem" the use of std::pair, or std::tuple, solves is the profiliation of one-off types you would make for these things that really are only used because of other language shortcomings
[13:52:39] <cbreak> but you wouldn't be able to tell based on the name
[13:53:15] <ville> the inability to return multiple values and how overload resolution works
[13:53:18] <cbreak> the problem tuple in particular solves is generic programming with limited introspection.
[13:53:23] <cbreak> but that's not what it's used for here.
[13:53:29] <cbreak> -> In my opinion, it's tuple abuse
[13:53:49] <ville> again they are being used for other language shortcomings
[13:53:53] <cbreak> multiple values can be returned with a struct, with properly named members
[13:54:16] <cbreak> which I'd prefer to having a pair
[13:54:41] <cbreak> or having two unnamed return values in a hypothetical C++ variant that allows more than one of them
[13:55:10] <ville> so what do you name it? say std::map::insert() you'd then name it std::map::insert_result?
[13:55:49] <cbreak> sure. With an "position" and "inserted" member
[13:56:18] <cbreak> or maybe "position" and "was_already_there"...
[13:56:18] *** Joins: interop_madness (~interop_m@user/interop-madness/x-0950004)
[13:56:39] <cbreak> either way, more intuitively usable than first and second.
[13:57:16] <cbreak> (there would obviously be a distinctly separate other struct, to replace the use of pair in map, with having "first" and "second" be replaced with "key" and "value"
[13:57:19] <ville> right, but the gained actual value there is... how much? would naming it result in some measurable improvement of some kind?
[13:57:37] <cbreak> the API would be more self-documenting
[13:57:50] <cbreak> that's the biggest improvement. Maybe the only one.
[13:58:10] <ville> cbreak: problem with that "value" being that containers chose to use value_type for something else, and it'd be mapped_value or such to match with mapped_type
[13:58:18] <PJBoy> gained value is the fact that I don't have to read code that says `it->first.second or whatever
[13:58:22] <cbreak> ville: makes sense, yes
[13:59:07] <PJBoy> and map::insert already has this
[13:59:25] <PJBoy> it has a map::insert_return_type return type with `position`, `inserted` and `node` members
[13:59:39] <cbreak> which map?
[13:59:42] <PJBoy> std::map
[13:59:47] <ville> oh they actually did it in 17
[13:59:52] <cbreak> https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/map/insert ?
[13:59:53] <PJBoy> it's just only available for the node overload
[14:00:08] <ville> if you insert a node, not a value_type
[14:00:19] <PJBoy> yeah they just realised that names are good too late
[14:00:30] <PJBoy> but stdlib's been working on that
[14:00:41] <PJBoy> all the ranges::algorithms have named return values too
[14:00:47] <cbreak> nice
[14:00:56] <cbreak> people agree with me! :D
[14:01:18] <ville> as much as i do advice against using pairs and tuples unfortunately in this case though i just don't think it's really one way or another
[14:02:56] <ville> it's in the who-gives-a-shit territory for me. now deciding to use a pair/tuple for an important data type in your domain that's used all over that's pretty clear cut "don't do it"
[14:03:19] <ville> as in i'll typedef a coordinate triplet as std::tuple<float, float, float>
[14:03:39] <PJBoy> tuple is considerably less usable than pair
[14:03:45] <PJBoy> get<0>(tup) etc.
[14:04:00] <fiesh> well that would just be an array<float, 3>
[14:04:16] <PJBoy> pair vs named struct I can understand, but tuple vs named struct is a one-sided debate

[15:36:07] <cbreak> so implement your member functions as part of a map class
[15:36:14] <cbreak> and have tiles just inside, as simple structs
[15:36:24] <cbreak> you can have the 1D <-> 2D logic in there too

[16:07:55] <helloWorld123> results in x being equal to 10
[16:08:11] <anyone> f was defined in line 6

[16:08:22] <anyone> do you not spot this

[16:12:29] <ville> helloWorld123: no. it wouldn't compile
[16:12:42] <ville> helloWorld123: you're trying to convert a pointer-to-function to an int
[16:13:07] <helloWorld123> so if it were int test2 { return test; }, then test would be called :D
[16:13:32] <ville> helloWorld123: no.. that wouldn't compile either. now your "function" has no parameter list

[16:13:50] <cbreak> to call a function, you need (), either directly or indirectly

[16:14:30] <helloWorld123> (to clarify: not a question)
[16:14:58] <ville> helloWorld123: yes. but that's not what you asked above. above you didn't call "test". you implicitly took it's address because you didn't call it using ()
[16:15:02] <ville> err its
[16:16:14] <helloWorld123> yeah, i corrected it as soon as you told me about this
[16:17:12] <helloWorld123> so f2() = 10; is another way of writing &x = 10;?
[16:17:26] <ville> no.. the latter would't compile
[16:17:27] <helloWorld123> sorry, *f

[16:19:57] <ville> an int &, a reference-to-int
[16:20:20] <ville> to go back to above, later doing &f would take the address of the function, not its return value as the function isn't called, which is funnily the same as doing just f which implictly converts to pointer-to-function

[16:22:54] <helloWorld123> apologies
[16:23:03] <ville> doing: using one of the expressions of the form: f, &f, f() or &f() are distinct things.
[16:24:33] <ville> f implicitly converts the expressio into the address of the function, &f does the same explicitly. f() results in a reference-to-int. &f() results in the address of the int the function returned a reference to

[23:27:28] <King_DuckZ> hey all, I have this code https://godbolt.org/z/1j68nra85 and I'd like line 28 to return V as it was at line 20. I know you can call virtual consteval methods but I'm not very familiar with that, do you think I could use that or any other language feature to make that V "leak out" of the constructor without adding it to class type itself?

[23:29:04] <King_DuckZ> or maybe there is just no way to do that in a constexpr context?

[23:42:34] <King_DuckZ> Alipha: hmmmm that's an interesting solution... thanks for providing it
[23:43:00] <King_DuckZ> I'll see if I can modify my real code to do something equivalent to that, with enough scaffholding
