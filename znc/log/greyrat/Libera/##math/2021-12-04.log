[02:33:54] <Batzy> laurus: i think it could be and isn't a big deal
[02:34:00] <Batzy> if you think about the indicator function
[02:34:12] <laurus> Batzy: I agree. Because then we would just split up u into u+ and u- as usual
[02:34:19] <Batzy> you can think of that as deciding where it's measure 0 and not
[02:34:25] <laurus> So we would have integrals of 1_A u+ and 1_A u-

[02:40:01] <Batzy> what is it

[02:40:31] <Batzy> ah
[02:40:40] <laurus> But the integrals u+ or u- could both be infinity
[02:40:52] <laurus> So then we get "infinity - infinity" which doesn't make sense.

[03:35:08] <somiaj> well if int_0^inf |f(t)|^p dt is convergent, then |f(t)|^p -> 0 or |f(t)| -> 0. If r>p then the tail end (for |f(t)| < 1), |f(t)|^p >= |f(t)|^4

[03:35:36] <rex> that you can assume
[03:35:43] <rex> p ≥ 1
[03:35:45] <somiaj> so that means you'll need a p < 1 for this to hold
[03:36:23] <somiaj> well if 1 <= p < r, then it appears you can use a comparision test to show they both have to converge, since for the tail end |f(t)|^p >= |f(t)|^r

[05:51:45] <isekaijin> Hello. I am trying to show that Z is not a profinite group (considered with any topology compatible with the group structure). Of course I am doing this by contradiction. Suppose Z is the limit of an inverse system (G_i, f_{ij}), with f_{ij} : G_j -> G_i. After a couple hours of work, I managed to reduce to the case where the f_{ij} are surjective.
[05:51:52] *** tusko is now known as m0she
[05:52:45] <isekaijin> Then the canonical projections p_i : Z -> G_i are also surjective, i.e., each G_i is isomorphic to Z/n_i for some n_i > 0.
[05:53:27] <isekaijin> And I am a little bit uncertain about what I should do next.
[05:54:24] <isekaijin> Okay, since Z is infinite, the inverse system cannot “stabilize” - the finite groups G_i have to keep getting bigger and bigger.
[05:55:37] <isekaijin> In particular, I can take a strictly increasing sequence of indices i0 < i1 < i2 < ... (where “i < j” actually means “i divides j”).
[05:55:52] *** m0she is now known as tusko
[05:57:20] <isekaijin> So, instead of my original inverse limit, I could just take the inverse limit of the G_{i_k}, which is a quotient of (hence not larger than) the original inverse limit.
[05:57:39] <isekaijin> I would like to show that this inverse limit is uncountable.
[05:58:09] <Guest78> sorry ise, that is way over my head

[06:53:50] <laurus> A question about this: https://a.uguu.se/mfrqwxLX.png . I understand that that integral is a linear functional, but why must it be positive?
[06:59:18] <isekaijin> laurus: I guess by “positive”, they mean that the integral of a positive function is always a positive number. (Where by “positive” I actually mean “nonnegative”.)
[06:59:26] <isekaijin> Errr
[06:59:31] <isekaijin> A positive integrable function, of course.
[06:59:49] <laurus> isekaijin: But u is just integrable here, not necessarily positive
[07:00:00] <laurus> It's just a real-valued u
[07:00:30] <laurus> Do you think this is a typo in the book?
[07:00:35] <isekaijin> It cannot be a linear functional if only positive values are attained.
[07:00:39] <laurus> (i.e. it shouldn't say the word "positive" there?)
[07:01:02] <laurus> OK, they sometimes use the word "positive" to mean "nonnegative"
[07:01:03] <isekaijin> So, if we are interpreting the text generously, then “positive” does not mean “only attains positive values”.
[07:01:12] <laurus> (that's another slightly annoying aspect of this)
[07:01:15] <isekaijin> Because this interpretation is obviously wrong.
[07:01:30] <laurus> When they say positive function for example they really mean nonnegative function.
[07:01:40] <isekaijin> laurus: It is consistent with the fact that we talk about the “positive” and “negative” parts of a measurable function.

[07:02:19] <isekaijin> Nah.
[07:02:32] <isekaijin> I suspect that a linear functional is meant to be “positive” if it sends “positive” functions to “positive” numbers.
[07:02:41] <laurus> isekaijin: Ahh... I see.
[07:02:49] <laurus> I know nothing about functionals
[07:03:14] <isekaijin> A linear functional could not possibly be “positive” in the sense that its image is the set of “positive” numbers.
[07:03:16] <laurus> Except when I looked it up on Wikipdia I learned that the members of the dual space from linear algebra seem to fit the definition of "functional"
[07:03:22] <isekaijin> Because, by linearity, its image has to be a vector subspace of R.
[07:03:29] <laurus> Right

[09:35:03] <mycroftiv> this makes me very happy. the fact that the ncube is just binary strings in disguise makes a lot of things conceptually legible

[17:43:38] <tolarz> About what exactly?
[17:43:46] <tolarz> How did you define line integrals in your class?
[17:44:46] <lok91> For instance, if I have a vector field F(x, y, z) = ye^(xy) i + (xe^(xy) + ze^y) j + e^y k... And I have a line integral \int_C F · dr, where C is the straight line from (1, 0, 0) to (0, 0, 1).
[17:44:50] <lok91> How would you proceed?
[17:44:50] *** Quits: Guest61 (~Guest61@195.157.65.68) (Quit: Ping timeout (120 seconds))
[17:45:43] <tolarz> well look up the definition of that integral
[17:45:50] <lok91> tolarz In our class, a "line integral" is an integral where the function to be integrated is evaluated along a curve
[17:46:00] <tolarz> look up formulae, not words
[17:46:09] <tolarz> almost surely you will get the same formula i typed above
[17:46:52] <lok91> Hm, \int_C f(r) ds = \int_a^b f(r(t)) |r'(t)| dt
[17:46:54] <lok91> Right?
[17:47:01] <lok91> r is a vector
[17:47:16] <lok91> A vector function, I mean
[17:47:21] <tolarz> idk
[17:47:31] <tolarz> idk what r is to begin with
[17:47:39] <tolarz> anyway, if that's the def you have, use it
[17:47:50] <tolarz> is r the parametrization of C?
[17:47:53] <tolarz> hmhm
[17:48:07] <lok91> r: [a, b] -> C is an arbitrary bijective parametrization of the curve C such that r(a) and r(b) give the endpoints of C and a < b
[17:48:19] <lok91> I can use the definition I want :P
[17:48:28] <tolarz> contiously differentiable one i guess
[17:48:55] <lok91> The curve C is piecewise smooth - that's all it tells
[17:53:10] <lok91> But we can also use your definition, tolarz. Would you agree that the answer is one?

[20:21:48] <Z-module> that's the *definition* of the subspace toplogy

[20:23:19] <Z-module> A is subspace-open iff that holds
[20:24:18] <zincy_> Ah ok so my argument is correct?
[20:24:55] <Z-module> no,  (1, 2]  is not subspace-open in S
[20:25:24] <Z-module> there is no U open in R with  (1,2] = U cap (1,3)
[20:25:47] <Z-module> because that would mean 2 is in U, thus some whole interval of reals just > 2 are also included
[20:26:25] <Z-module> I assume your notation  (1, 2] has the usual meaning:  { r : 1 < r <= 2 }
[20:27:22] <zincy_> Yes
[20:28:30] <Z-module> Since (1, 3) is open, every set  U cap (1, 3)  (U open in R) is also open in R.  So the subspace-open subsets of S are just the subsets that are also open in R.   (1, 2]  is not open in R.
[20:28:33] <zincy_> Oh so all the open sets in the subspace are formed by intersecting all the open sets in R with our S (subspace set)
[20:28:44] <Z-module> yes

[20:31:56] <Z-module> not really that
[20:32:09] <Z-module> it's because for EVERY open subset U of R,   U cap S != (1, 2]
[20:32:37] <Z-module> because if 2 is in U, then so is everything in (2, 2+eps)  for some (possibly very tiny) positive eps
[20:33:22] <lok91> Could anyone help me verifying my answers to some questions? Some line integrals, contour integrals, etc. I do not really understand how to type it in a calculator as I do with simple integrals, when I want to verify my result. So I want to check whether my answers are indeed correct.
[20:33:24] <Z-module> remember that a set U in R is open iff:  for every u in U, an interval  (u - eps, u + eps)  exists that is entirely a subset of U
[20:33:39] <Z-module> "all points near enough to u are also in U"
[20:34:25] <Z-module> so no open subsets of R have a maximum element, or a minimum.

[22:07:08] <mycroftiv> I just learned the dimension n of manifold M is intrinsically characterized by the fact that for x in M, the local homology group H_i(M,M-{x};Z) is nonzero only for i = n.
[22:07:16] <isekaijin> riv: Nah. In the general case, they do not have the same minimal polynomial.
[22:07:38] <isekaijin> riv: Which makes computing the action generators of D8 rather difficult.
[22:07:54] <isekaijin> \alpha and \beta have the same minimal polynomial when q(p^2 - q) is a square.
[22:07:59] <riv> i can't get my head around ti when they aren't concrete numbers
[22:08:06] <isekaijin> haha

[22:10:27] <Z-module> zincy_:  Q (the last one) is indeed open. But not the second set, because it is not  U cap Q    for any open (in R) set U. Your U = (0, +infty) has intersection with Q that is    {all rational q > 0},  not   (0,2] cap Q = {rationals that are > 0 and <= 2}
[22:10:37] <isekaijin> Nevertheless, I think I did well overall in this Galois theory test.
[22:10:43] <isekaijin> It was the last test before the final exam.
[22:11:42] <isekaijin> I had to work with profinite groups, in particular absolute Galois groups with the Krull topology. These are really cool.
[22:12:20] <isekaijin> Some of the proofs feel like fancier inductions.
[22:12:48] <isekaijin> (e.g., the proof of “every profinite group is the inverse limit of a surjective system”)
[22:13:22] <riv> way hard stuff
[22:13:28] <mycroftiv> isekaijin: im cheering for you, i owe you since awhile ago some comments of yours about geometric meaning prompted me to re-examine the topological/geometric significance of concepts i knew logically and my brain is currently being insight-exploded by homological algebra
[22:14:04] <isekaijin> haha ty

[23:55:29] <droid3> hey guys got an exciting topic to talk on. More for the advanced math person today.
[23:55:39] <since_> hi, i change playback speeds often. can i calculate the total playback duration as average_playback_speed * original_length?
[23:55:40] <droid3> Aka measure theory!
[23:56:43] <droid3> Take any set X it is trivial to see we can endow it to be a measurable space by just taking the sets {X, empty set } to create the sigma algebra for it.
[23:57:24] <droid3> NOT A VERY USEFUL EXAMPLE BUT IT SHOWS ANY SET X CAN BE MADE INTO A MEASURABLE SPACE.
[23:57:37] <droid3> Not really saying much though

[23:59:26] <droid3> not measurable space means the X with it sigma algebra NOT including a measure for it
