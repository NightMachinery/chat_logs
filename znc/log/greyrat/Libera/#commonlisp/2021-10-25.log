[15:39:26] <mfiano> Also I should mention that I didn't get to review any yet, but I'm sure I saw at least a few CL entries, so not entirely off-topic :)
[15:40:02] <mfiano> Enjoy, and don't let the boss see you trying them on yet another slow-moving Monday ;)
[15:57:34] <flip214> mfiano: any chance to get the develop branch of Virality Engine into QL? (with all dependencies?)
[15:59:13] <mfiano> flip214: Not a chance any time soon. The other developer needed a long break, probably for the rest of the year, and its dependencies diverged too much to be able to build it. The project is basically on hold and un-usable until we are both back working on it.
[16:00:14] <mfiano> You can stop by #bufferswap and ping psilord to ask when he plans on coming back :)
[16:00:28] <flip214> hmmm, I really would like to try some game environment where I can (defparameter *player* (make-instance ...)) and then play around in the REPL
[16:01:04] <flip214> mfiano: no, I'd rather not be the reason for more stress.
[16:01:18] <mfiano> :)
[16:03:00] <mfiano> I have a few engines that meet that criteria, but I too have been on a gamedev break for a few months, and I have no idea how well they compile right now, and there is zero documentation.
[16:03:15] <mfiano> Your best bet is probably CEPL for that type of exploratory programming though.

[17:19:09] <greyrat> Is there a way to get other key arguments and forward them to another function? Sth ala

[17:19:10] <greyrat>   (apply #'make-instance 'repo :tags tags args))
[17:19:56] <beach> Sure, but you need to put the &rest before &key.
[17:20:31] <greyrat> beach: Do i also need =&allow-other-keys=?
[17:20:49] <Bike> that depends on whether you want to allow other keys
[17:20:49] <Colleen> Bike: drmeister said 8 hours, 7 minutes ago:
[17:20:49] <Colleen> Bike: drmeister said 8 hours, 5 minutes ago: I got the multiple entry points somewhat working.  A "local" and a "xep" function are being generated.  I'll need some help tomorrow to set up the argument handling for the lcl function and for the xep function(s).
[17:20:55] <Bike> oops
[17:21:22] <Bike> if you do it without allow-other-keys than you can call (repo-new :tags whatever) fine, but other keys will cause an error, same as usual
[17:21:24] <beach> greyrat: Common Lisp allows for multiple occurrences of an argument keyword in a list of arguments, so you just need to put the overriding ones first.
[17:21:44] <beach> greyrat: As Bike says, it is independent of &allow-other-keys.
[17:22:24] <greyrat> beach: I get an error that =&key= is getting an odd number of args: https://paste.gnugen.ch/paste/4HN3
[17:23:08] <Bike> right, because you did that
[17:23:17] <Bike> if you want to include required or optional args you need to specify those as well

[17:31:51] <Bike> that's what inspect does. it's interactive.
[17:32:04] <Bike> if you want the non-interactive information dump, use describe.
[17:32:27] <greyrat> Oh. I saw `(inspect some-var` in https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/clos.html.
[17:32:28] <beach> greyrat: Could you please acknowledge that you understood the previous remarks, or that on the contrary, you didn't understand them?
[17:32:47] <greyrat> beach: I kind of understood them.
[17:33:01] <greyrat> Trying to verify, using `inspect` or `describe` or whatever.
[17:33:36] <beach> The function?
[17:36:23] <greyrat> Okay. =(&rest args &key (tags nil) &allow-other-keys)= seems to do what I want, as the first occurence of a keyword arg overrides the later ones. But is there a way to extract the keyword arguments from =args=, such that only unused arguments remain in =args=?
[17:36:45] <Bike> if you do &rest and &key, all of the rest arguments are keyword arguments as well.
[17:37:07] <beach> greyrat: Why do you want to extract them?
[17:37:12] <beach> They are harmless.
[17:37:40] <beach> greyrat: If you want to do that, you need to do it MANUALLY, using REMF for instance.
[17:37:51] <beach> clhs remf
[17:37:51] <specbot> http://www.lispworks.com/reference/HyperSpec/Body/m_remf.htm

[17:39:03] <beach> Hmm.
[17:39:22] <beach> greyrat: You can call the wrapped functions with :ALLOW-OTHER-KEYS T.
[17:39:29] <mfiano> Keywords are not positional, and are optional.

[17:40:01] <greyrat> beach: Wouldn't that force me to modify the wrapped function, and reduce safety in general?
[17:40:14] <beach> greyrat: No, it's all in the caller, like I said.
[17:40:30] <beach> Notice that I didn't say to modify the caller to use &allow-other-keys.

[17:42:55] <beach> Or with APPLY in general.
[17:43:23] <mfiano> Why do you annotate your forms on IRC with #\= ?
[17:43:26] <jackdaniel> unless it is obviously correct, I'd remove unwanted keywords from the property list. you may accidently pass a matching keyword argument to the callee
[17:43:58] <beach> jackdaniel: But doing that would require consing.
[17:45:29] <jackdaniel> delete-from-plist manipulates the original list. that said my point is that if both the caller and the callee accept a keyword :name with a different meaning then you could introduce a bug
[17:45:56] <jackdaniel> because it is a seldom situation I've added "unless it is obviously correct"
[17:46:14] <mfiano> jackdaniel: That is up to the implementation. It may also cons.
[17:46:50] <jackdaniel> as I said, that's beside the point. unlessy ou say that when you consider consing vs introducing a bug it is a dillema

[19:02:58] <CodeBitCookie[m]> I was working with strings and knew about cl-str. I didn't know there was also a cl-string. Can anyone point out the differences or why aynone would choose one over the other in some cases? Thanks.

[23:12:00] <jmercouris> also the first example should obviously read (first (sort xyz #'some-predicate))

[23:13:38] <jmercouris> what is extremum mean? I've never heard this word
[23:14:00] <jmercouris> oh wow, it's a real word

[23:24:19] <Josh_2> This is when copying the examples from CLHS
[23:25:14] <Bike> you mean you're using one of the examples without changes? which one?
[23:25:47] <Josh_2> I was just trying to or one, but with a different name
[23:25:52] <Josh_2> trying the or one*
[23:26:13] <Josh_2> I'm trying to make a method combination that returns a string
[23:26:36] <Josh_2> by concatenating the results of all of the method calls together, something like that
[23:27:04] <Bike> oh, if you want to do that you shouldn't need to do anything complicated
[23:27:23] <Bike> just do (defun strcat (&rest strings) (apply #'concatenate 'string strings)) and then use the short form define-method-combination
[23:27:24] <Josh_2> Well I'd like to understand how its working in case I want to define something more complicated
