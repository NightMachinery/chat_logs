[16:24:57] <prussian> I see systemd hate still goes strong? there is an irony. that docker story really shows that the idea of a single-writer with exclusive control of certain kernel features like netfilter would have prevented it.
[16:26:20] <gerikson> reading that now
[16:27:56] <prussian> also, it's one of the many reasons I stopped using docker (moby) because it uses its rootness to assume control of its own domain.
[16:28:35] <gerikson> ``When I containerized MongoDB, Docker helpfully inserted an allow rule into iptables, opening up MongoDB to the world. So while my firewall was “active”, doing a sudo iptables -L | grep 27017 showed that MongoDB was open the world. This has been a Docker footgun since 2014.''
[16:28:42] <gerikson> wow
[16:29:34] <Brekkjern> The IPv6 "support" is also garbage. It's just a 6to4 NAT...
[16:29:38] <prussian> ya.... libvirtd also does something similar and also why I still use iptables, since having both nftables and iptables active gives me issues with
[16:29:45] <prussian> dlna
[16:30:05] <prussian> clearly we need a systemd-firewalld.
[16:30:24] <Brekkjern> So if you do access permissions on the source IP then any IPv6 connection will have an origin as coming from the "local" network

[20:22:48] <bkero> nice
[20:24:06] <prussian> is tailscale suppose to replace my tinc net or something?
[20:24:31] <cb> it's hamachi for people who dont say the gamer word
[20:24:37] <prussian> oh
[20:24:57] <Geekingfrog> oh my, hamachi, been *ages* I haven't heard of that

[20:32:42] <indigo> Hard work thread on HN is the gift that keeps on giving
[20:35:38] <Xe> Church: i wouldn't really suggest headscale, it's not the most up to date and not tested that well
[20:36:10] <Xe> tailscale should be compatible with it, but it's not really tested so it's difficult to say for sure or not
[20:38:27] <Xe> at some level it's an admirable reverse engineering project though
[20:44:12] <Church> Aye thought so
[20:44:16] <Church> Just thought it was neat.

[21:46:54] <bkero> You don’t read a book by reading the first 10 pages. You don’t learn a culture by visiting a place for a week"
[21:47:04] <bkero> yeah, if you only travel to places for a week you miss out on a lot of stuff
[21:47:35] <bkero> So if you don't get much out of a week somewhere, don't do that? But also someone else might get more from the same time.
[21:51:24] <indigo> I think it's great to go somewhere for a week
[21:51:48] <indigo> Guess I'm shallow cause I'm not chasing the "deep experiences"
[21:59:17] <geoffwozniak> I'm not big on travelling around the world, but when I have travelled, it's always been a worthwhile experience
[22:09:40] <mouseghost> i think i would enjoy travelling more if i could drive the car instead
[22:10:35] <hoistbypetard> you spend your whole life wanting to drive the car… and once you can you spend the rest of it aggravated that you have to fucking drive the car :)
[22:11:04] <hoistbypetard> that’s an exaggeration… there is a honeymoon period of several months
[22:11:31] <indigo> Long road trips can be rather relaxing
[22:11:49] <hoistbypetard> especially if someone else is driving
[22:12:30] <indigo> Eh, even if you're driving. I did 7hrs driving from LA -> Bay Area recently and it was chill :) Then again 7hrs might not be a "long" trip
[22:15:05] <hoistbypetard> i enjoy them when I’m driving also, when the road is open anyway. stop and go traffic around here has tarnished my overall outlook on driving.
[22:16:22] <indigo> Oh yeah, stop and go traffic is the worst for road trips
[22:17:52] <hoistbypetard> we are planning a long one this summer. either dc <-> Colorado or dc -> Charleston -> Acadia -> dc
[22:17:59] <hoistbypetard> (debate is ongoing)
[22:18:57] <ngoldbaum> colorado is gonna be smoky af come july or august
[22:19:06] <ngoldbaum> entire western half of the country…
[22:19:24] <hoistbypetard> ooo. that’s a good point. we’re talking first 16 days of august
[22:20:18] <hoistbypetard> is that an every year thing, or is this year expected to be an outlier?
[22:21:39] <ngoldbaum> i mean it’s 120 degrees in the pnw and norcal already
[22:21:48] <ngoldbaum> eastern colorado is also in a deep drought
[22:22:27] <ngoldbaum> we had very thick smoke here from the bay area and sonoma fires last year
[22:23:13] <ngoldbaum> thankfully west of the continental divide had a lot of rain this year so no close fires but that doesn’t mean much if it just blows in from
[22:23:17] <ngoldbaum> further away

[22:53:04] <mouseghost> hoistbypetard, still waiting to get my license
[22:53:17] <mouseghost> i kinda envy that i think in the us its from the age of 16?
[22:53:28] <bradfier> I always enjoy when Americans talk about driving somewhere on a long trip
[22:53:44] <bradfier> And they go "Oh yeah we're going to go from DC to Colorado" like it's nbd
[22:54:01] <ngoldbaum> bradfier: it is as long as you don’t go through kansas
[22:54:02] <bradfier> And I'm here thinking that London to Edinburgh is a big trip and deciding if I want to fly commercial instead
[22:54:07] <ngoldbaum> I-70 through kansas is hell
[22:54:40] <ngoldbaum> mouseghost: in many states you can get a learners permit at 15 and license at 16, depends though
[22:54:48] <mouseghost> hell, thats even younger
[22:54:56] <mouseghost> and here i have to wait till im 18
[22:55:07] <hoistbypetard> unfortunately there are relatives in both Topeka and KC, so I get to enjoy I70 and the KS turnpike if we go that way.
[22:55:19] <ngoldbaum> gross, don’t speed
[22:55:29] <bradfier> Turnpike always sound like a kind of fish to this dirty euro
[22:55:33] <ngoldbaum> like half my lifetime speeding tickets are on I-70 in kansas
[22:56:10] <hoistbypetard> I don’t… I live in VA
[22:56:44] <hoistbypetard> before I moved here, half of my lifetime speeding tickets were here
[22:57:13] <hoistbypetard> heh. turnpike is a fancy word for toll road, AFAICT
[22:57:26] <ngoldbaum> i did eastern virginia to Boulder in 25 hours straight once, i do not advise doing that
[22:58:14] <hoistbypetard> with kids and dogs in the car, it’s going to be about 5h travel per day
[22:58:27] <hoistbypetard> and lots of stopping to enjoy the trip
[22:59:49] <hoistbypetard> with kids and dogs in the car, it’s going to be about 5h travel per day
[23:00:13] <hoistbypetard> huh. never seen an irc client send out of order before. go IRCCloud, go!
[23:00:54] <ngoldbaum> webscale
[23:02:53] <hoistbypetard> mouseghost: with my French friends in my 20s, we observed that Americans (who start learning to drive around age 15 and at that time had unrestricted licenses before age 17) generally drive pretty sensibly but drink in absolutely insane ways. Whereas the French people our age would generally drink sensibly but drive like they have a deathwish. (They couldn’t get their licenses until at least 18, and most couldn’t afford it till
[23:02:53] <hoistbypetard> their 20s)
[23:04:15] <mouseghost> no wonder, practice does it things ;v
[23:04:23] <mouseghost> anyways, what do you know about drinking :P
[23:04:41] <ngoldbaum> at least around here 10% of drivers are psycho
[23:04:52] <ngoldbaum> and another 10% are so timid it’s dangerous
[23:05:41] <indigo> hoistbypetard: IRCCloud is like a Ford Pinto. It'll get you there... eventually, and with a few tows
[23:06:39] <hoistbypetard> indigo: do you know an iPad client you like better? Since the pandemic, I’ve found that I like delegating most chat/meetings/email to the tablet
[23:07:04] <hoistbypetard> largely because of shitty electron meeting clients that suck a lot more than their tablet counterparts
[23:07:24] <ngoldbaum> i’ve heard thelounge is good
[23:08:19] <bkero> Thelounge works pretty well
[23:10:15] <hoistbypetard> I will have to kick the tires on that. I still run my own ZNC even with IRCCloud, so there’s not much friction to trying something new.
[23:12:25] <bkero> I run TheLounge through my own ZNC server as well.
[23:18:31] <companion_cube> hoistbypetard: to be fair,  driving in the US is incredibly easy
[23:21:10] <hoistbypetard> That depends where you are… I once drove a 17-foot panel truck through the Bronx then Manhattan at rush hour. That was not any kind of easy. Interstate highways are generally very easy, though :)
[23:25:14] <companion_cube> pretty sure that even driving in NYC is easier than Paris
[23:25:19] <companion_cube> (which in turn is easier than Rome)
[23:28:15] <hoistbypetard> Yeah, probably so. The streets are more suited to driving at a bare minimum.
[23:29:32] <companion_cube> city plans are often gris, roads and parking lots are a lot wider
[23:29:35] <companion_cube> grids*
[23:30:45] <ngoldbaum> driving through manhattan in rush hour is no fun
[23:31:13] <hoistbypetard> the most terrified I’ve ever been on the road was riding on the back of a friend’s motorcycle in Montpellier. the city walls are very close to the traffic, which threads that needle with much more speed than I’d ever want to.
[23:32:53] <hoistbypetard> manhattan rush hour is its own kind of challenge, but doesn’t match that kind of pants-crapping terror
[23:33:24] <gerikson> ``has anyone put forth a spec for a Zettelkasten transfer format? ''
[23:36:53] <companion_cube> can't wait for activitypub for zettelkasten
[23:37:04] <companion_cube> or alternatively, zettelcoin on ethereum
[23:37:08] <indigo> hoistbypetard: Nope... at least, not one that fits my use case of "I don't have to manage a server"

[23:50:53] <hoistbypetard> this is fine art
[23:55:29] <geoffwozniak> nice
[23:56:21] <geoffwozniak> 1488 tests written for this rather simple data structure, just because I don't want to get burned by it in some weird corner case
[23:56:37] <hoistbypetard> (!)
[23:57:06] <geoffwozniak> It is the core logic of my compiler pass, so it had better be correct
[23:57:09] <geoffwozniak> Still...
[23:58:16] <geoffwozniak> One nice thing is the data structure vastly simplifies the code
[23:59:51] <riv> um what is the data structure
