[04:55:12] <joako_> I just cant figure out how I can dump URLs into 1 string variable
[04:55:50] <Albright> You want to combine an array of URLs into one string?
[04:56:06] <joako_> An array of whatever
[04:56:13] <joako_> Well not an array, a JSON
[04:56:29] <Albright> You want to make a JSON array of URLS?
[04:56:47] <joako_> I have a JSON and I need to decode it
[04:57:11] <Albright> Okay, well, you found json_decode().
[04:57:15] <joako_> I can not figure out how to deal with  "some key": [ "http://1", http:/2" ]
[04:57:26] <joako_> The issue is the values inside do not have their own key like all the examples I can find
[04:57:31] <Albright> What do you mean by "deal with?"
[04:57:52] <Albright> Right, it will be an array
[04:57:58] <joako_> I just want to print the value of some key
[04:58:51] <Albright> Assuming json_decode() gives you an object, it'd be $object->keyName.
[04:59:21] <joako_> Yes but in this case it is blank because it is not a single value
[04:59:26] <joako_> "text": "the text is here" "URLs": [ "http://1", http:/2" ]
[04:59:28] <Albright> Blank?
[04:59:33] <Albright> Right, it will be an array.
[04:59:39] <joako_>  $object->text = the text is here
[04:59:43] <joako_>  $object->URLs = blank
[04:59:52] <Albright> Define "blank."
[05:00:03] <joako_> Blank. There is nothing there
[05:00:42] <Albright> like are you trying to print the value somehow and it's not showing anything?
[05:01:06] <joako_> Correct, it is blank!
[05:01:15] <Albright> How are you trying to print it?
[05:01:31] <joako_> In an email
[05:01:42] <Albright> I mean in terms of code.

[08:38:14] <arash> Hello, Is it wrong to have multiple blank line between my codes?
[08:47:15] <Blondie101010> that is a matter of your organization's coding standards
[08:47:39] <Rockwood> Blondie101010, o/
[08:49:40] <arash> I'm working for a company that they told me my codes are not following psr coding standards, how important is this? is it ok to write in my own way then fix these issue by using "PHP Coding Standards Fixer" and "PHP_CodeSniffer" ?
[08:51:19] <Rockwood> yes very important if you wanna make any thing standard wise
[08:52:21] <Rockwood> mostly companies are following the psr standards
[08:56:19] <TML> arash: To PHP, it's not important you follow PSR _at all_; but it sounds like to your _EMPLOYER_, it matters a _great deal_, so really the question you need to be asking yourself is "How much do I care about this job?"
[08:56:38] <TML> arash: Personally, I wouldn't know a PSR coding standard if it bit me in the face
[08:56:47] <TML> it's never been a problem for me
[08:57:33] <arash> TML, that is exactly what I'm dealing with. thank you.
[09:02:33] <TML> arash: OTOH, it is not at all unusual for a given employer to expect the developers to write in some kind of coding standard, and I'm sure the PSR standards are just as cromulent as any other standard out there.

[11:49:43] <AllenJB> PEAR is ancient pre-Composer stuff. Nobody uses that any more.
[11:49:47] <AllenJB> Use Composer
[11:50:12] <mishehu> thanks for making me feel old, AllenJB
[11:50:24] <ejjfunky> i just did a fresh php install. on it, it says recommended package is install php-pear
[11:50:29] <mishehu> I don't use it but I remember when projects I'd encounter used them
[11:51:17] <ejjfunky> i installed php 7.4
[11:51:34] <mishehu> ejjfunky: yeah, afaik pear really isn't where the action is at anymore.
[11:51:42] <ejjfunky> oh ok
[11:51:51] <mishehu> composer is supposed to be easier, though I personally have not used it.
[11:52:14] <ejjfunky> oh ok. thanks. i've been using composer thus far. never php-pear though. that's why i asked.
[11:52:23] <Rockwood> composer means magic
[11:52:34] <ejjfunky> Rockwood, yea, isnt it.
[11:54:53] <AllenJB> Composer is not magic. It's autoloading + namespaces. In terms of community, virtually every PHP library and framework can be installed via Composer. Very few can be installed via PEAR any more.

[18:16:12] <tester12> Hi freinds
[18:16:57] <tester12> I have a web application that users can use it with some browsers like chrome, Firefox,...
[18:21:35] <tester12> my customer ask me to store their data on local system instead of my server, meanwhile the app keep and use on my server to using
[18:21:43] <tester12> from customer
[18:24:07] <tester12> and I want store data to file or a small DBM like mysql or sqlite on windows system of customer by a way that first get form input data from user and encrypt on server an back to local user system and store there
[18:25:56] <tester12> in your opinion whats best ways to do this project by javascript or third party software or not, and other language or scripts that can use in browser for web applications
[18:25:58] <tester12> ???
[18:31:51] <Robdgreat> tester12: php can't store data on the client side
[18:32:16] <Robdgreat> you can try #javascript
[18:33:54] <stenno> no
[18:34:00] *** Parts: grawity (grawity@star.nullroute.lt) ()
[18:35:22] <stenno> client side javascript cannot write things to a mysql database

[18:35:45] <Robdgreat> oh, I missed that
[18:36:24] <Robdgreat> tester12: I think what you want is a native application :P
[18:36:28] <stenno> ^
[18:37:06] <tester12> Robdgreat I dont want use php for store on client side
[18:38:13] <tester12> stenno yes I know, Im looking for a good way to do this or store data on a file
[18:38:44] <stenno> write a native application in your favorite programming language
[18:38:50] <tester12> is there a way to use node.js and javascript to do some work
[18:38:52] <tester12> ??
[18:39:04] <stenno> yes, you can use node.js to write things to databases
[18:39:43] <stenno> one question mark is enough btw
[18:41:26] <__adrian> tester12: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage
[18:41:34] <__adrian> no, you can't use node.
[18:41:36] <tester12> stenno is there any way to send data by javascript in browser to a small app in local system by execute or send a request to execute an app on windows?
[18:41:52] <__adrian> no. that would be a horrible security risk.
[18:41:58] <tester12> with API
[18:41:58] <stenno> tester12: if it is in the browser, then not
[18:42:04] <stenno> if its not in the browser, then yes
[18:42:37] <__adrian> tester12: localstorage is what you're looking for. read up; /join #javascript for questions.
[18:42:52] <tester12> ok
[18:42:55] <tester12> thanks
[18:43:10] <Robdgreat> tester12: word to the wise: if you know you don't want to use php, #php isn't the right place to ask :)
[18:43:13] <stenno> i don't think localstorage is what he wants
[18:43:22] * __adrian shrugs
[18:43:32] <__adrian> "web app that stores data locally" sounds like localstorage to me
[18:44:02] <__adrian> as mentioned, if they want to get rid of the browser, than maybe a native app is what they want. but if they keep the browser, then this is it
[18:44:10] <Rockwood> __adrian, hi sir
[18:44:14] <Rockwood> stenno, o/
[18:44:17] <stenno> hi
[18:44:22] <__adrian> hi
[18:44:27] <tester12> stenno no exactly I want local storage
[18:44:38] <tester12> oh I forgot it
[18:44:48] <__adrian> tester12: you want to keep the web app (you do not want to replace it with a windows app)?
[18:45:08] <stenno> the only way for their customer to access this data would be over localstorage
[18:45:15] <stenno> that sounds not good at all
[18:45:23] <__adrian> ^  i.e., only on the website, in the same browser
[18:45:34] <tester12> whats the best,quick and simple way to encrypt and descypt data by php
[18:45:35] <__adrian> "sounds not good at all"  depends on needs
[18:46:01] <__adrian> tester12: https://packagist.org/packages/paragonie/halite
[18:46:04] <tester12> data like user informations and their registered projects?
[18:47:07] <tester12> __adrian yes I want keep web app and just change storage way from server side to local or client sid after encryption
[18:47:14] <stenno> sounds more like you want an API on the server side which allows you to do data analysis
[18:47:28] <stenno> dunno why you would save stuff like that in the browser on the client side
[18:47:52] <stenno> just write an endpoint on the server side which provides a file with the data
[18:48:01] <stenno> e.g. a CSV file

[18:49:33] <tester12> stenno I want make data on client encrypted not simple text file, but I can csv with encrypted data
[18:49:34] <stenno> it sounds as if your client just wants to have a way to obtain reports about page usage

[18:50:18] <__adrian> you'd need to figure out how to share keys; you'd need to figure out how to get your customer to install the same algos, etc.
[18:51:40] <tester12> __adrian data isnt a big data file and just has text and simple string information like last and first name,phone, projects id, project information and else
[18:51:41] <__adrian> i'm with stenno here. you need to figure out what the ask really is - i.e., what do they want you to solve (not what do they want you to "do").
[18:51:57] <__adrian> tester12: what the data is isn't relevant
[18:52:00] <stenno> __adrian: i just wanted to say 'give the customer what they need, not what they want' :D
[18:52:14] <__adrian> (at least not to the encryption question)
[18:52:48] <__adrian> stenno: indeed. could also be phrased "solve their problem, don't just do what they tell you"
[18:52:56] <tester12> __adrian encryption use to secure data to stealing or easy access
[18:53:10] <__adrian> tester12: that's not what i mean
[18:53:22] <__adrian> you need to know what problem is being solved by not storing data on the server.
[18:53:31] <tester12> and my web app is the way to get money easier'=D

[18:56:36] <__adrian> "for some reason" means there's no way for you to get good advice. so... just go do something, and maybe it's what they need or maybe it's a waste of time.

[18:57:43] <__adrian> that's not how you get good results
[18:58:06] <stenno> its your job to evaluate their request and assess if its feasable, and if it isn't, you should suggest sensible alternatives
[18:58:10] <tester12> sorry thanks to you if give me some suggestion to ways of simple encryption data in php
[18:58:58] <__adrian> i did, above. but that doesn't mean it will be useful to your problem. if they want the data to be decrypted on the client's computer, there will be a lot more involved.

[19:20:21] <tester12> The customer is afraid of storing information on the server and does not want the information to go outside her organization
[19:20:46] <__adrian> then why are you encrypting it _on your server_? that's on your server. not local.
[19:20:54] <tester12> and I want show him that I do this job
[19:24:28] <__adrian> sounds like they are "afraid" but don't really understand what they're afraid of or why. YOU (because you are the programmer) need to help them understand _how things work_ (i.e., storing info "locally" might mean several different things) and what they _actually need_ because this will change how it's done. e.g., if they expect you to be able to store their data locally but _behave_ like a normal website,
[19:24:34] <__adrian> that's not how it works. if you just say "yes i can do that!" then you're in for a bad time, and the customer WON'T get what they want (what they want is nonsense) and they'll only be mad at you in the end.
[19:25:17] <__adrian> THIS is why you need to understand what you're doing before you go do it.
[19:27:31] <tester12> user open app by URL, log into his account, type information of one project like project #267 in project form and click Register or Submit, data submitted to server, in server encrypt data and returns it to client and store it on system by a way, when user want see project#267 information click on view button and get encrypted data from local path
[19:27:32] <tester12> of file like encrypted text file and sends it to server after decryption , display information to user
[19:30:18] <__adrian> sending data to your server for encryption/decryption very nearly completely defeats "store locally because i don't trust your server."
[19:30:41] <tester12> __adrian Why do you complicate the issue so much? That customer asked for something and after receiving the information and complete design of the web application, we do not have the opportunity to rewrite this app again and we want the storage method to change from server to client or local and look for a suitable way We are for encryption and
[19:30:42] <tester12> storage. Please help me if you have a way, otherwise thank you for all the tips and I apologize for taking the time.

[19:34:55] <__adrian> i'm not complicating this :) i'm pointing out that neither you nor your customer _seems_ to know what they really want to solve, and without that information you cannot get good advice on how to solve it.
[19:34:57] *** Rockwood_ is now known as Rockwood
[19:35:26] <__adrian> as we've seen, all you'll get is a bunch of random advice and "but that doesn't sound right"
[19:36:06] <Robdgreat> this is very step 1: steal underpants step 2: ??? step 3: PROFIT!
[19:37:44] <stenno> how about programming a button on the client which you press, and then it gets the data from the server
[19:37:52] <stenno> isn't that what your customer wants
[19:38:05] <stenno> why save it in the client BEFORE you actually need it? that doesn't make sense
[19:38:06] <__adrian> "they want store data local"
[19:38:18] <stenno> they can store data locally by downloading it explicitely
[19:38:36] <stenno> anyway as you said it doesn't really make sense to continue this in the first place
[19:39:24] <__adrian> i'm not sure, and maybe i'm wrong, but it sounds like "customer doesn't trust server"
[19:39:26] <tester12> __adrian Your work is great, you want to suggest the best ways to do a better project, but we have now done all the agreement and we should immediately start the method and programming and just look for the best simple ways to recover encryption on the server and then save We are in the customer system, ie the client.
[19:39:26] <tester12> You are a very good boy and thank you, but now is not the time to discuss choosing a better way, and it is important that the project is completed as soon as possible, otherwise the contract will be canceled and we will not have any income.

[21:14:34] <da_wunder> Ronalds_Mazitis_: but really it looks like you're not sending that data as a form data (which is converted to $_POST), you're sending that as request body, so most likely you need to use eg. `$data = json_decode(file_get_contents("php://input"));` to get that information

[21:33:08] <da_wunder> tl;dr - you cannot use $_POST if you're not sending data as form data, in that case you need to read that data from request body eg. $data = json_decode(file_get_contents("php://input")); OR just make necessary change to your frontend (javascript code) to send that data as form object

[21:38:54] <stenno> you are banned in #javascript because of channel disruption and help vampirism
[21:39:52] <stenno> (as you wondered why before)

[21:40:55] <stenno> i remember the situation, i quieted you to give you a chance to cool down, but you kept flaming, and then were banned by ljharb
[21:41:05] <__adrian> tip: if you "wonder why," you should politely ask the op on the channel in question
[21:41:10] <stenno> so that is the reason in case you 'wondered'\
[21:41:14] <__adrian> please don't bring that here either.
[21:41:19] <stenno> right
[21:41:27] <stenno> sorry
[21:41:30] <__adrian> np
[21:42:27] <da_wunder> and now the reactions about the help don't surprise me at all
