[00:00:19] <somiaj> so I think it will be skewed to the left, with the smaller numbers occurning much more often, since there are lots of ways to write 1 but not as many ways to write 5
[00:00:52] <cuppajoeman> cool, I'll try it
[00:00:53] *** Quits: drogas (~drogas@jump2.jet.uk) (Quit: Connection closed)
[00:02:01] <somiaj> i.e. 1 = 1-0, 2-1, 3-2, ..., 99-98, while 5=5-0, 6-1, ..., 99-94, (so here it is slighlty less likely) but as you get to numbers like 25, 26, etc, you get less often. Now since you are choosing 4 different numbrs, this may skew things a bit, but I don't think too much

[00:09:02] <somiaj> Samian: At least in this case, it is a quick thing to program and create some psudo-random histograms to look at to give you some ideas
[00:13:55] <somiaj> cuppajoeman: and then as I mentioned, you can remove the basis from this, and it still all works
[00:14:25] <somiaj> cuppajoeman: but to me this looks like motiviation for the definition I gave you eariler.

[00:19:31] <somiaj> I just find it useful, and there are various other things that you can define in a similar fashion
[00:19:40] <somiaj> foo is the smallest bar that contains A

[00:20:01] *** Quits: Leonarbro (~Leonet@user/leonarbro) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[00:20:07] <somiaj> and you can define this by just taking the intersection of all things that contain A, in this case it is a topology, but this also works for sigma algebras in measure theory
[00:20:39] <somiaj> And it is a useful definition to use to prove things, for instance your statement follows almost directly from the definition

[04:16:25] <cherim> A polynomial is reducible if it is a product of polynomials of smaller degrees
[04:18:06] <Bowserinator> so is it literally asking if I can factor the polynomial?
[04:18:22] <Bowserinator> and GF(2) just means I take coefficents mod 2 when dividing / multiplying?
[04:18:33] <cherim> Yes
[04:18:45] <Bowserinator> oh that makes it a lot easier XD
[04:18:48] <Bowserinator> thanks :D
[04:19:09] <cherim> x^3+1 = (x+1)(x^2+x+1) is reducible, x^2+1=(x+1)(x+1) is reducible, x^2+x+1 is not

[12:33:22] <[-_-]> mawk: can you help me with why d(-x)=-dx ?
[12:33:47] <mawk> well it's related, the complex integral is actually real because the integrand you started with is even
[12:33:47] <[-_-]> I kind of...ummm...don't understand
[12:33:56] <[-_-]> yes
[12:33:59] <mawk> if it were odd the integral with e^ix would be pure imaginary
[12:34:10] <[-_-]> oh...okay
[12:34:12] <mawk> d acts like derivative
[12:34:35] <mawk> (-f)' = -f'
[12:34:46] <[-_-]> ha..:)
[12:34:55] <mawk> df is a shortcut for df/dx dx
[12:35:06] <mawk> and here f(x) = -x
[12:35:12] <mawk> so df = -dx
[12:35:21] <mawk> and dx = -df

[12:37:04] <[-_-]>   nice
[12:37:07] <mawk> you can make all these considerations about df rigorous by saying it's the differential of f, and then writing df outside an integral actually makes sense
[12:37:48] <[-_-]> "<mawk> df is a shortcut for df/dx dx" this is good, I never really understood df
[12:37:56] <[-_-]> before

[12:45:29] <mawk> rigor isn't always an exercise in futility, it's also a way to actually devise a proof or think about a problem
[12:45:50] <river> so a 1-form in my understanding, is essentially a vector of real numbers, instead of (a,b) we write a dx + b dy
[12:46:02] <mawk> and ultimately writing something that makes sense
[12:46:02] <river> they form a ring, and we have a 'd' operation on these, is that roughly correct?
[12:46:07] <[-_-]> oh...really...I don't know what rigor is, so I could be wrong... :|

[16:37:09] <[itchyjunk]> Hello, i would like to know when the idea of natural numbers being a semi ring historically cropped up. What date and around what context. Not having success googling. any ideas?
[16:39:41] <Z-module> [itchyjunk]: I don't think people really thought of semirings at all till mid-20th century. Once the definition was there, N is just one of the most natural examples.
[16:40:05] <[itchyjunk]> oh it was that late for semi rings? poop
[16:40:05] <Z-module> But N with + and * , as a structure, was certainly long before then.
[16:40:13] <[itchyjunk]> ohh
[16:40:26] <[itchyjunk]> does that have a special non semi ring name?
[16:40:36] <[itchyjunk]> did they call it anything in particular? N with + and *

[16:50:06] <Z-module> The problem is that, as of some time ago, the term "an algebra over R" (where R is a commutative ring) has a specific meaning in algebra, and in this meaning, semirings don't work (unless they are actually rings). But yeah, the word "algebra" is used in a whole bunch of ways.

[16:54:19] <dila> is it ok to view field automorphisms as linear maps?
[16:54:21] <[itchyjunk]> Right, having vector addition and multiplciation (or module) ends up giving an ring structure on top of field structure which is also called algebra
[16:54:45] <[itchyjunk]> hmm linear maps are talked about in vector spaces right?
[16:54:49] <dila> yes
[16:55:00] <quantum> dila: I don't see why not
[16:55:23] <quantum> they are linear at the end of the day
[16:55:46] <Z-module> dila, if F is a field, then it is a 1-dimensional vector space over the field F.  So if a map phi:F -> F  preserves all of F's sums and products, then even if it's not bijective, it is certainly an F-linear map for the vector space F.

[16:56:02] <[itchyjunk]> hmm
[16:56:29] <dila> e.g. in C you can write Re(z) = (1/2)z + (1/2)(z^*) and Im(z) = (1/2i)z + (1/2i)(z^*)
[16:57:06] <Z-module> oh wait, I messed that up. To be F-linear, you need  phi(fg) = f phi(g)   for all f and g.
[16:57:35] <dila> with that you can write any linear function of Re(z) and Im(z) as a linear combination of these basis functions from "weighted" linear combinations of the automorphisms of C (z itself being the identity automorphism and z^* being complex conjugation)
[16:57:45] <isekaijin> It just means that F has a subfield isomorphic to the whole of it.

[16:58:44] <Z-module> phi being a field endomorphism also means  phi(fg) = phi(f) phi(g) so if this = f phi(g), take g = phi(g) = 1 and we end up getting that phi(f) = f for all f, so phi is the identity map.
[16:59:04] <Z-module> So other than the identity map, no field automorphism of F is an F-linear map.
[16:59:07] <isekaijin> Let's call this subfield E, i.e., the image of phi. The problem is that you cannot simultaneously identify the copy of F in the domain with both E and the copy of F in the codomain.

[17:04:53] <quantum> dila: Instead of requiring that the map be linear for the entire field, you can consider maps which are linear for some subfield.

[18:35:07] <riv> what do you mean when you say linear form
[18:35:09] <mawk> and when you go further and want to characterize having a metric that depends on the current location, like in GR, I think it leads one way or another to differentials

[20:00:05] <quantum> more geometrically, it reflects how you only have a sensible notion of integration over things which have a sensible notion of orientation
[20:00:16] <quantum> and when you flip the orientation, you flip the sign of the integral
[20:03:42] <joel135> i like that too
[20:03:53] <joel135> wildberger likes signed areas too
[20:04:31] <quantum> Integration really is one of the prettiest concepts I feel
[20:05:03] <joel135> it is so mysterious too in various ways

[20:06:57] <joel135> first the very notion of function, which is forced to be more general than 'polynomial' once you integrate 1/(1+x^2), and then later you learn about complex integrals which don't depend on nearly any details of the path ... and finally we still haven't solved the riemann hypothesis
[20:07:21] *** Joins: Gustavo6046 (~Gustavo60@user/gustavo6046)
[20:08:15] <joel135> also the fact, which i haven't really seen emphasized, that the indicator function of a nice enough set can be written as a complex integral involving 1/(z - w)
[20:09:06] <quantum> Currently open problems aside, I think many of the mysteries of integration can be resolved just by moving to a more geometric setting
[20:09:16] <joel135> it is as if integrals force us into deep water, unlike derivatives
[20:09:48] <joel135> could you outline the appropriate geometric setting?
[20:10:19] <quantum> so instead of integrating functions, you integrate differential forms on some manifold

[20:13:17] <joel135> i don't think that's different from how i usually think about things
[20:14:05] <joel135> but this perspective seems to lose out on formula manipulation, which is part of the mystery
[20:14:34] <quantum> the formula manipulation is there, it's just hidden
[20:14:59] <quantum> it's usually encoded as facts about the space you're integrating over or about differential forms
[20:16:25] <joel135> right so it is abstracted into mostly geometric language, you would say?
[20:16:32] <quantum> yes
[20:16:37] <joel135> ok
[20:17:27] <quantum> with this perspective, things are typically some corollary of the (generalised) Stokes' theorem
[20:17:31] <quantum> or some functoriality result
[20:18:47] <joel135> ∂uality ♥
[20:19:05] <quantum> e.g. we can write integration by parts as `int_{a,b} fg = int_{[a,b]}(fdg + gdf)`

[20:19:58] <joel135> oh you meant it like that

[20:25:25] <joel135> that was probably it
[20:25:49] <quantum> but thinking about integration in this way leads to all sorts of nice results in differential topology
[20:26:48] <joel135> like what?
[20:27:05] <quantum> Poincaré duality states that there's an equivalence between submanifolds (up to some kind of topological equivalence) and particular kinds of integrals
[20:28:42] <joel135> do you know if it is right to think of poincaré duality as related to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_graph ?
[20:29:14] <joel135> i don't really know where i got that from but i usually call it poincaré duality
[20:29:28] <quantum> I don't think they're related
[20:29:33] <joel135> ok
[20:30:06] <quantum> actually...
[20:30:16] <johnkeats7> they are
[20:30:23] <joel135> i asked a similar question on element.io before
[20:30:55] <joel135> someone answered that poincare duality is sort of like spanier-whitehead duality, and this sent me reading some general paper about duality.
[20:31:05] <johnkeats7> this is exactly the original idea of poincaré duality. given a triangulated manifold you can obtain a dual triangulation where p simplices correspond to n-p simplices of the original triangulation
[20:31:17] <johnkeats7> and this switches the betti numbers around
[20:31:52] <johnkeats7> unfortunately this beautiful geometric idea is in modern texts hidden behind abstract nonsense
[20:32:00] <quantum> So PD was originally an equivalence between homology classes?
[20:32:28] <johnkeats7> originally it was really the observation that betti numbers are symmetric about the middle one
[20:32:29] <joel135> i really like that graph duality. it is used to draw string diagrams for (higher) categories.

[20:35:12] <quantum> stupid question, why don't we have PD between homology groups?
