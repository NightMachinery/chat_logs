[00:59:24] <rpifan> im thinking of throwing my mattress directly on the floor
[00:59:29] <rpifan> supposed to be better for your back
[01:00:11] <Riviera> i thought sleeping more or less directly on the floor was supposed to be good
[01:00:51] <fritzwastaken> i do it from time to time when my back is fucked
[01:01:01] <rpifan> yea i had a plan to buy a japenese style futon
[01:01:01] <Riviera> yup me too
[01:01:04] <rpifan> but apparently they are expensive
[01:01:06] <boi> fuck futons
[01:01:10] <rpifan> and two this mattress is new i just bought it
[01:01:19] <boi> my japanese side of family uses it i hate futons
[01:01:21] <rpifan> i mean a traditional futon, that type quilt type mattress
[01:01:30] <rpifan> boi, oh are they bad? ive never used them
[01:01:37] <Riviera> tatamis? hm
[01:01:44] <rpifan> no the futon goes on the tatami
[01:01:45] <boi> yeah grandmas house is all tatami
[01:01:46] <boi> not my thing
[01:02:05] <Riviera> rpifan: ah
[01:02:08] <rpifan> what do you dislike about it? boi 
[01:02:08] <boi> futon feels too hard imo
[01:02:18] <boi> i like to jump on my bed and relax
[01:02:27] <boi> also i hate having to roll it up every morning
[01:02:28] <rpifan> when i go music festival cmaping and sleep on the ground after 2 days my back feels much better
[01:02:36] <Riviera> i dont find sinking in half a metre particularly relaxing
[01:02:41] <Riviera> :))
[01:02:48] <rpifan> lol
[01:03:03] <rpifan> when i go campng i dont bother with any blankets or air mattress direct on the ground
[01:03:13] <rpifan> hurts the first night until you get your back realigned but after that no issues
[01:03:16] <fritzwastaken> rawdoggin the ground
[01:03:17] <fritzwastaken> I like it
[01:03:17] <rpifan> so i thought with a futon it would be similar
[01:03:23] <Riviera> no Isomatte? :D
[01:03:31] <rpifan> no
[01:03:37] <Riviera> tough :)

[04:27:05] <jimender2> whats the command for that (windows)? route 192.168.0.67?
[04:28:04] <Jay-Ros> from the front to the back, you've got a vm network interface behaving like a trunk port... which would be blocked on my network with bdpuguard, then you've got a firewall, which does firewall stuff
[04:28:25] <Jay-Ros> then you've got a new route plan which needs to be advertised internally
[04:30:10] <jimender2> I know that the 10.24.0.x ips have internet access and can access anything in the 192.168.0.x network
[04:30:58] <Jay-Ros> so can you access devices inside the 192.168.0.0 network?
[04:31:03] <Jay-Ros> from 10.24.0.0?
[04:31:07] <jimender2> yes
[04:31:11] <Jay-Ros> just not ping
[04:32:06] <jimender2> The issue that I am having is that I set my wan IP to be 192.168.0.67 and when I ping 67 from 192.168.0.69 it wont ping
[04:32:31] <Jay-Ros> can you ping other devices in the network?
[04:33:26] <jimender2> From 192.168.0.x I can ping any other 192.168.0.x device.  The 10.24.0.x network is unpingable
[04:33:54] <Jay-Ros> do you have  ICMP enabled? It's usually disabled by default
[04:35:22] <jimender2> Where is that setting at?
[04:35:34] <Jay-Ros> fuck knows, I use cisco everything
[04:36:05] <jimender2> Essentially what we are doing is trying to keep other fucktards from stomping on our dev servers
[04:36:08] <Jay-Ros> it'll be a generic firewall allow which needs to be explicit for outgoing traffic... if it's already there then it's something else
[04:36:20] <Jay-Ros> I mean, you've set this thing up, so it's not on them
[04:36:50] <Jay-Ros> you could've created a firewall policy to stop the fucktards reaching the dev devices
[04:36:59] <Jay-Ros> but you've added another network layer instead
[04:37:09] <jimender2> They set up random static IPs for anything and by giving us one IP, if they stomp on it we dont need to worry about it
[04:37:35] <Jay-Ros> sounds pretty fucky
[04:37:41] <jimender2> We dont have access to our firewall and they just set static IPs anyway
[04:37:49] <Jay-Ros> my devs behave, even if $boss asks them to do something they run it by us
[04:38:23] <jimender2> The controls guys keep stomping on the devs / production boxes since they dont give a fuck
[04:38:48] <Jay-Ros> anyway, check the firewall setting
[04:39:00] <Jay-Ros> I could google it for you, but it seems your devices can reach the internet...
[04:39:10] <jimender2> I honestly dont think it is firewall issue
[04:39:49] <xe0n> have you got a rule on the pfsense to allow icmp from the external (wan) interface?
[04:39:59] <Jay-Ros> ^
[04:40:23] <jimender2> Oooo.... let me figure out how to get on that network remotely

[04:42:30] <Jay-Ros> <Jay-Ros> you could've created a firewall policy to stop the fucktards reaching the dev devices
[04:44:03] <jimender2> Jay-Ros we dont have that ability

[04:44:48] <jimender2> Our guest network is super duper segmented but our internal prod network is flatter than my chest
[04:45:07] <Jay-Ros> anyway, ICMP
[04:45:11] <Jay-Ros> firewall
[04:45:13] <Jay-Ros> do it to it
[04:47:36] <jimender2> ok that part works now
[04:47:38] <jimender2> Cool
[04:47:52] <jimender2> Now I got to get haproxy working right
[04:48:25] * Jay-Ros checks we're not in #reddit-homelab
[04:48:43] <Jay-Ros> you should fire their servers up on proxmox
[04:49:02] <jimender2> I want to rip and replace our servers with proxmox
[04:49:09] <jimender2> beats vsphere5
[04:49:17] <Jay-Ros> https://freeloadbalancer.com/
[04:49:37] <Jay-Ros> just toss a kemp box there
[04:51:22] <jimender2> we are redirecting traffic from a external firewall, to our pfsense through the haproxy instance and then some of that traffic will prolly go to a kube ingress thing
[04:51:55] <jimender2> Can I enable traffic from 192.168.0.x network directly to the 10.24.0.x network?
[04:52:10] <jimender2> that would involve adding a route correct?
[04:52:10] <xe0n> loll
[04:52:18] * Jay-Ros curls up in a ball
[04:52:55] * Jay-Ros refers to the googles
[04:53:28] <Jay-Ros> next minute: prod network redirects all traffic via dev environment
[04:53:45] <xe0n> so what is the 192.168.x network?
[04:53:49] <xe0n> is that like dmz, prod, etc?
[04:53:54] <xe0n> and the devs have the 10.x whatever network?
[04:54:01] <jimender2> its our prod network
[04:54:06] <Jay-Ros> it's his dev dmz, which is then splurged out to the 10.x prod
[04:54:13] <Jay-Ros> so he's just adding a subnet
[04:54:17] <Jay-Ros> using a firewall
[04:54:27] <xe0n> sounds like you've put a pfsense on the prod network, the lan IP it has is being used to NAT traffic to the network hanging off the pfsense
[04:54:47] <jimender2> I think that is correct xe0n
[04:54:50] <xe0n> so the pfsense isnt directly connected to the network, it's passing traffic to the edge firewall
[04:55:02] <xe0n> connected to the internet*
[04:55:16] <xe0n> so yeah sounds like routes and policies on the firewall
[04:55:19] <xe0n> i do the similiar setup with my lab
[04:55:23] <jimender2> connected to our 192 network
[04:55:35] <xe0n> lab has its own firewall, which connects to my home network, but the interface for the home network is set to external
[04:55:44] <jimender2> let me do a quick drawing
[04:55:46] <xe0n> then i have networks hanging off the lab firewall that nat traffic out my edge firewall
[05:04:45] <jimender2> https://postimg.cc/y3gxMpC9/5cfc9ed1 xe0n thats my network rn

[05:05:39] <xe0n> fuck man
[05:05:39] <xe0n> lol
[05:05:42] <xe0n> theres shape tools
[05:05:42] <jimender2> only thing that I can do on the 192 network is assign ips
[05:05:43] <xe0n> lol
[05:06:03] <xe0n> yeah so you're double natting
[05:06:06] <xe0n> its rules and routes
[05:06:08] <jimender2> I figured it was a good time to whip out my drawing pen
[05:06:25] <Jay-Ros> before or after a gallon of coffee?
[05:06:26] <xe0n> so need to allow a rule on the firewall to allow icmp from "external\anyone" or you create an alias on the box with the network subnet for prod
[05:06:37] <xe0n> and say Prod network can talk to whatever network hanging off this over icmp
[05:06:48] <jimender2> Which firewall?
[05:06:50] <xe0n> so its pretty much how i do it here at home
[05:06:52] <xe0n> the pfsense
[05:07:18] <jimender2> I can ping the pfsense from the 192 network now
[05:07:50] <jimender2> I want to type 10.24.0.69 from the 192 network and get to the git server
[05:07:58] <xe0n> yep
[05:08:04] <xe0n> so you need a route on the gateway of the prod server to say
[05:08:17] <xe0n> to get to 10.24.x, the next hop is the interface on the pfsense
[05:08:28] <xe0n> your gateway needs to know how to route the request to the other subnet\network
[05:08:30] <xe0n> and where the hop is
[05:09:07] <jimender2> so on the 192.168.0.1 gateway server, I add a rule that says 10.24.x goes to 192.168.0.67 and everything should be good then?
[05:09:18] <xe0n> its a route
[05:09:31] <xe0n> yes, to get to the 10.24.x network the next hop is 192.168.0.67
[05:09:41] <xe0n> then that pfsense gets the requests and routes it to the appropriate interface\network
[05:10:04] <jimender2> can I do it just on the devs laptops?
[05:10:10] <xe0n> sure
[05:11:11] <xe0n> route ADD 10.24.0.0 MASK 255.255.255.0 192.168.0.67
[05:11:43] <jimender2> I was just typing that out Lol

[05:12:14] <xe0n> sooo see how you go just using ^

[05:17:17] <jimender2> did that xe0n
[05:17:50] <jimender2> I have two possible issues, either the pfsense is not letting traffic through to it or its cause Im remote
[05:18:17] <xe0n> i would first try with a machine on site, then worry about you accessing it over the vpn or something
[05:18:23] <xe0n> vpn you'll need to do additional config on the firewall
[05:18:37] <xe0n> i would assume anyway...
[05:20:38] <jimender2> must be a firewall issue
[05:21:16] <jimender2> I just remoted into a prod server and did that command and it wont connect
[05:21:43] <xe0n> LOL testing in prod classic
[05:22:09] <xe0n> either way, issue is routes\policies, have you got a policy there allowing traffic from the 192.x network to the ones hanging off the pfsense?
[05:22:30] <jimender2> some of us are lucky to have a prod network
[05:22:40] <jimender2> the rest of us have a dev network
[05:24:15] <jimender2> WAN Interface, Protocol ANY Source Network 192.168.0.0/24  That it?
[05:29:10] <xe0n> so to the pfsense, 192.168.x is an external network
[05:29:20] <xe0n> so yeah you need to allow external traffic to the internal networks hanging off the thing
[05:30:05] <jimender2> I got it working
[05:30:11] <jimender2> Was not in firewall rules

Only three people in prepped what commands for changes they were going to make or test it on a lab switch. about 10 times walked in the morning and my building is offline because someone made a change the night before, went home, and took the day off.

[10:24:55] <xe0n> and also hopefully prevent problems...
[10:24:59] <xe0n> HOPEFULLY
[10:25:17] <JollyRgrs> chg mgmt is a pain when you want to "fix something real quick"...  which means it'll A) save your ass from your own mistakes (sometimes) and B) stop you from having to drop what you are doing to do something for someone just b/c THEY think it's an emergency
[10:25:18] <csws> if your change management process isn't complete shit it should only be a minor inconvenience
[10:25:19] <csws> saves a lot of pain
[10:25:23] <csws> definitely worth it
[10:25:52] <csws> JollyRgrs, a lot of places will allow retroactive emergency changes though if it's a real "this must be fixed now" kinda situation
[10:26:12] <sd> 14<Nâ€‹oob> Good luck.

[17:49:02] <corn266> it's like child support or who a child goes to during a divorce
[17:49:06] <sintax> corn266: my parents are involved in his life. so he has one side of grandparents
[17:49:11] <sintax> corn266: correct. 
[17:49:38] <sintax> i just put that she can't see him in our agreement between baby mama and me so she would sign it and i'd be a "parent" in the eyes of the state i live in
[17:49:55] <sintax> since if you have a child and aren't married where i am the mother gets all the rights and the father gets none
[17:49:57] <corn266> ew
[17:50:01] <sintax> ya know, because we're all dead beat fathers

[17:50:45] <corn266> my sister's baby daddy actually got out of child support by marrying her and then divorcing her a little bit later

[17:52:56] <JollyRgrs> and normally, i side with trying to get the father as much time as he can... but my wife's ex was extremely abusive (mentally and physically)... he should have no rights... and his new wife isn't even any better than he is (she's actually worse)...
[17:53:08] <sintax> dang.
