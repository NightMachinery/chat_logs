For b) I believe it to be 365Cn/365^n because there are 365^n possible birthday configurations, and there are 365 C n ways to
[02:30:26] <cuppajoeman> choose n people to have the same birthday

[10:17:01] <Guest81> oh oh okay
[10:17:08] <Guest81> that's right
[10:17:27] <greenbagels> even in the normal case of d/dx f(x) you can imagine it's the chain rule with the special case of g=x
[10:17:47] <greenbagels> where g'(x)=1, the multiplicative identity (so really you *always* are using the chain rule)
[10:18:45] <greenbagels> Simplar: hm? are you thinking of the fundamental theorem of algebra? (an n degree polynomial with coefficients in C has n roots in C)
[10:18:57] <Simplar> Oh, yes!
[10:19:21] <greenbagels> there's a lot of "fundamental theorems"
[10:19:34] <somiaj> greenbagels: Isn't the fundamental theorem every polynomial of degree >= 1 has at least one complex root?
[10:19:41] <somiaj> and what you stated is a corallary
[10:19:44] <cherim> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_theorems_called_fundamental
[10:20:08] <greenbagels> somiaj: aren't they equivalent?
[10:20:26] *** Joins: Furai (~Furai@cookiehoster.furai.pl)
[10:20:50] <Guest81> okay for integral_sqrt(x)^x of e^t / t dt ... I first write this as: -int_0^sqrt(x) e^t / t dt + int_0^x e^t /t dt. Then I take derivative. For the first summand, F(sqrt(x)) = -int_0^sqrt(x) e^t / t dt. So F'(sqrt(x)) = e^x / x * (1/2)*(x)^(-1/2).  Is this right for the derivative of the first summand?
[10:21:31] <somiaj> yea, though usually what you wrote isn't the fundamental theorem, in my experience, though the original fundamental thereom by gauss didn't even involve C
[10:21:52] <greenbagels> ah i see; i'm oblivious to the history / standard definition of it
[10:22:02] <greenbagels> i should be more careful about stating it
[10:22:41] <somiaj> The original one was every polynomial of degree >= 1 can be factored into linear and irreduicible quadratic factors, mostly because the 'imaginary numbers' were just tools to prove it, but not something they found to useful at the time
[10:22:57] <somiaj> though what you wrote is fine, I just think it is a bit more common just to claim the existance of a root vs the full factorization
[10:23:07] <greenbagels> yeah it's definitely cleaner to state
[10:23:28] <cherim> (Little) Bezout protests against losing his job
[10:23:29] <somiaj> wikipedia agrees for what that is worth, "The fundamental theorem of algebra states that every non-constant single-variable polynomial with complex coefficients has at least one complex root."

[10:24:55] <greenbagels> cherim: ah are you saying its not equivalent since you need both little bezout + FTA to prove the n degree corollary?
[10:25:11] <greenbagels> and the n degree corollary doesn't give you little bezout?
[10:26:54] <cherim> It's a matter of convention, you can prove Bezout independently later. But the standard course is as somiaj describes. I never saw alternative statements of FTA in printed form
[10:27:17] <Guest81> is there a way i can verify what i wrote with wolfram?
[10:27:30] <greenbagels> not a surefire way for all integrands, without paying money
[10:27:42] <greenbagels> but i dont see why you would split the integral unless you're worried x can be negative
[10:28:08] <greenbagels> since sqrt(x) <= x for all x >=0
[10:28:37] <Guest81> its just that my textbook does that
[10:28:40] <greenbagels> cherim: fair enough, i have the same experience, though i've not read many texts about C
[10:28:46] <Guest81> I don't know why it does it

[10:31:21] <Guest81> mhm. I am just concerned about applying the chain rule correctly
[10:33:19] <greenbagels> right; your F' shouldnt contain an integral unless i'm still spouting nonsense

[10:35:04] <Guest81> its hard to read math written in text to be fair

[14:07:28] <mornfall> or perhaps PlanckWalk's formulation, which i am not even sure is equivalent
[14:08:45] <PlanckWalk> You can prove that every path has a finite extension
[14:09:08] <PlanckWalk> But without some form of choice, you can't (in general) prove that it has a *infinite* extension.
[14:09:43] <mornfall> you need to prove it doesn't, which is different from being unable to prove it does
[14:09:56] <PlanckWalk> With a negation of choice, you can prove it doesn't.
[14:10:30] <PlanckWalk> Which is why the first thing I said was "Is this assuming the negation of Choice or something?"
[14:11:20] <PlanckWalk> But that question was never answered.
[14:11:57] <mornfall> right, so back to the part where you prove an object exists (the finitely extended path) and also that it cannot be constructed (if you can construct the finite extension, surely you can use induction to construct an infinite path)

[14:12:16] <PlanckWalk> You can't use induction to construct an infinite path.

[14:13:49] <PlanckWalk> Then *if* you had Dependent Choice, you could select one extension from every one of the infinitely many sets and get an infinite path.
[14:14:59] <PlanckWalk> If you have some negation of Dependent Choice (which may literally just be *the* negation of DC), then you can prove that there exists some graph where you can't do that.
[14:15:00] <mornfall> so why can't i take the union of the infinite number of extensions? they are all finite after all

[14:15:47] <mornfall> sure, but i am constructing just one path
[14:15:50] <PlanckWalk> As in, infinitely many *choices* of extensions
[14:16:08] <PlanckWalk> If you take the union of all of them, you don't get a path
[14:16:14] <PlanckWalk> You just get a subtree
[14:16:18] <mornfall> yes i do, they are all extensions of each other
[14:16:26] <mornfall> that's what a path is
[14:16:37] <joel135> extension is 'nondeterministic' at each step
[14:16:42] <PlanckWalk> You can only specify *finitely* many extensions.
[14:16:59] <mornfall> if you can construct _the_ finite extension
[14:17:01] <PlanckWalk> You can prove that for every finite length there are extensions
[14:17:07] <mornfall> just one specific extension; doesn't matter which
[14:17:31] <PlanckWalk> No matter how long a finite length you specify, there are still infinitely many choices to be made for the ret.
[14:17:34] <PlanckWalk> rest*
[14:18:21] <mornfall> you make it; then you make another of the longer path, which is a superset; by induction, you have a chain of paths, each a superset of the previous?
[14:18:38] <mornfall> or perhaps induction doesn't work in this theory?
[14:18:51] <PlanckWalk> It doesn't
[14:18:58] <PlanckWalk> Well, it works, but not *like that*
[14:19:07] <mornfall> how does it work, then? :)
[14:19:43] <joel135> if you interpret 'can be extended one more step' intuitionistically, you do get a specific extension, which can be extended infinitely and constructively
[14:20:08] <joel135> from this perspective, the problem lies in " That is, "
[14:20:28] <mornfall> joel135: so i have been saying since the start, you must prove that the finite extension exists _and_ that it cannot be constructed
[14:20:41] <mornfall> because if it can be constructed, i really don't see how the induction fails
[14:20:42] <joel135> i don't get what you mean
[14:20:45] <PlanckWalk> mornfall: Just look at the form of induction.  The conclusion is of the form "for all n, there exists..."
[14:21:22] <PlanckWalk> It *doesn't* say "there exists <something> such that for all n, ..."
[14:21:35] <joel135> (if you could rephrase it as 'you must ... *in order to* ..." it would be clearer)
[14:22:13] <mornfall> joel135: in order to prevent the inductive construction of an infinite path
[14:22:14] <PlanckWalk> You need a principle stronger than just induction to get from finitely many to infinitely many.
[14:22:54] <mornfall> induction and an infinite union (the latter is presumably available)
[14:23:16] <PlanckWalk> A well-ordering principle would do, but the proposition that any set can be well-ordered is equivalent to Axiom of Choice (with suitable other set theory axioms)
[14:23:31] <PlanckWalk> mornfall: Infinite union is available, but you don't have a suitable set
[14:23:54] <joel135> 'to prevent the inductive construction of an infinite path' could mean different things. i would default to a model theoretic perspective rather than the assumption of the negative of a principle.
[14:25:02] <joel135> it is also unclear what you mean by existence if not constructive existence.
[14:25:51] <PlanckWalk> Induction gives you existence of finite paths of every length
[14:26:02] <PlanckWalk> (afk)
[14:26:33] <mornfall> joel135: well, i would find it very reasonable if constructibility implied existence (or rather very unreasonable, if it did not)

[14:38:47] <joel135> yes, but it still works at any finite depth, nonconstructively

[16:18:59] <quarterback> I am thinking there may be a unique solution and I havent thought of what planes they represent and the obvious condition is that the system of equations is non singular i.e their determinant is not zero.

[18:39:36] <[-_-]> if you see it, you may notice that 20.61 is also an ODE
[18:39:36] <qergle> and neither have order 4

[20:06:38] <[-_-]> can someone suggest a good book for learning fourier series and fourier transform?
[20:07:03] <pikapika> tusko, what kind of probability stuff are they teaching
[20:07:52] <tusko> Basics, counting, probability axioms, conditional probabilities, random variables, jointly distributed, ..., simulations
[20:08:23] <pikapika> tusko, I'd say
[20:08:26] <tusko> If I pass this class I would probably go on to mathematical statistics

[21:30:11] <peepsalot> i'm using a software library which has a notion of "convexity" of polyhedrons as a natural number, representing the maximum number of times an arbitrary ray can intersect with said polyhedron.
[21:30:16] <peepsalot> so a truly convex polyhedron has "convexity" of 1...  a torus would have convexity of 2, etc.
[21:30:16] <peepsalot> i'm interested in knowing if there are algorithms to calculate this value, but i think it is a nonstandard usage of the term.  is there any other name for it?

[23:48:05] <blackfield> wait but i want the subset to contain maps which are both isotone and homomorphisms.. while G doesn't need have just homomorphisms, so likely that would be a proper subset
