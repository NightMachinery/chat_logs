[00:11:42] <tpefreedom> noscript vs librejs
[00:13:13] <Noisytoot> librejs blocks nonfree javascript, noscript blocks all javascript
[00:13:47] <zleap> how many sites break if you use librejs and noscript ?
[00:14:06] <KE0VVT> tpefreedom: Actually, the NoScript dev rewrote LibreJS, and it is made to work alongside it if one wishes.
[00:14:17] <KE0VVT> zleap: Lots of sites break.
[00:14:39] <zleap> i thought that may be the case
[00:15:00] <KE0VVT> zleap: I have both IceCat and an unmodified Firefox for proprietary stuff.

[00:16:11] <zleap> so is non free js just js on a website that we can't examine the source code ?
[00:16:11] <KE0VVT> zleap: Yeah, so if something breaks in IceCat and I really feel I need to run something, I run it in Firefox.
[00:16:32] <KE0VVT> zleap: JS that has no license and the code is scrambled.

[00:43:59] <Noisytoot> zleap, but GNU Social (which implements OStatus) and Mastodon (which implements ActivityPub) are incompatible but are still both part of the fediverse

[13:10:35] <DiffieHellman> Hmm, has google seriously managed to patent 802.11 AP scanning?
[13:11:08] <DiffieHellman> Exported in 2015 at least.
[13:12:08] <DiffieHellman> Wasn't google actually, was some chinese university, so no matter.
[13:12:29] <Armand> #fakenews :P
[13:13:36] <DiffieHellman> Currently trying to figure out how 802.11 AP scanning actually works. I previously though that AP's just transmitted at set intervals, but AP scanning seems to be an active thing.
[13:13:53] <kilobug> jpp: too bad I'm on the other side of France ;) but btw do you know if there is any official rms or fsf stance on the "sanitary pass" (QR-code enabled proof of vacination or of recent negative covid test) that'll likely be required ? I personally don't have any issue with requiring people to be vaccinated or recently tested to attend indoors public event to block spread of covid, but I do have some about how 
[13:13:59] <kilobug> the QR codes are handled... with non-free software and cloud-based databases and... :/
[13:14:46] <rber> it is active and it's also a big sinkhole of privacy since for some time people could just know whatever networks you were in
[13:16:21] <rber> the adapters would literally advertise which networks they were in
[13:16:36] <DiffieHellman> In my country, to get a "certificate" they first try to get you to install their proprietary app. There's a website that doesn't operate without nonfree JavaScript. You can thankfully at least call them and get them to mail it to you, but everything is in their proprietary database which I suspect is sitting there with the password of "password".
[13:16:41] <rber> but for new APs it can only be passive I guess
[13:18:15] <jpp> Ah OK kilobug 
[13:18:54] *** Joins: kirk781 (~doors_1@2402:3a80:1f81:540b:26d1:de56:189d:faea)
[13:19:11] <kilobug> DiffieHellman: here they do push install to install their proprietary app that does contact tracing, ... but you do get the proof vaccination printed at the vaccination center and it's relatively easy to get it as a PDF file
[13:19:12] <DiffieHellman> rber: So the "scan" command 
[13:20:02] <DiffieHellman> .... doesn't transmit anything, but just tells the Wi-Fi card to provide the list of wireless APs that it knows?
[13:21:01] <kilobug> DiffieHellman: but when they flash your QR code in a restaurant, cinema, ... it is with non-free software and cloud-based databases; it's not such a big deal to me, in practice consquences are very low and it does slow the spread of the virus, but it is worrisome they don't use fully free software and auditable, local, secure databases
[13:21:42] <DiffieHellman> kilobug: Here they originally released a proprietary contact tracing app, but they made it free software eventually as there was no excuse for it not to be. It was never it widespread usage or widely recommended as you just can't get bluetooth to work of course.

[22:41:29] <yrk> belgin: theoretically, yes. this is since you can start liberating a non-free system by writing a free editor for it and compile it with the system's non-free compiler, then write a free compiler for that system, then ...
[22:42:14] <yrk> belgin: however, if there is already an equivallent free compiler available, then that would be a different situation

[22:58:35] <potatoxel[m]> <belgin> "can a program be considered free..." <- id not consider it free, depends on nonfree compiler.
[23:02:51] <belgin> before linux was part of gnu, all gnu programs depended on nonfree kernels
[23:03:02] <belgin> did that make them nonfree too?
[23:03:41] <yrk> also http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#NonFreeTools
[23:04:09] <yrk> belgin: that was exactly my point. gnu started that way
[23:04:38] <belgin> i see. so a free program that only compiles with a nonfree toolchain is free
[23:07:02] <yrk> belgin: it is free in the same sense that server can be running free software; in both cases it is technically free, but you don't get to enjoy that freedom
[23:07:02] *** Joins: andrzejku (~andrzejku@45-11-60-125.ip4.greenlan.pl)
[23:08:16] <yrk> belgin: so software can be technically free, but only runs on a system you can't run. and in the same way you can be interacting with a server running free software, but without the ability to modify the server software you don't have any control over it
[23:08:18] <belgin> it's schrodinger's freedom. it's both free and nonfree :D

[23:10:36] <yrk> belgin: just like there are reasons for running non-free software; for instance in order to reverse engineer it. since software freedom is a political goal, it all depends on whether it is politically expedient to do what you are doing (the freedom ladder is a way of expressing this issue)
