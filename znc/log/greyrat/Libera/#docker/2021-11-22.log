[01:15:57] <motsu> hey there - i have a (probably) dumb question... but how do i get my docker containers to not resolve their hostname to localhost? I have pod1 hosting a website over https, and i want pod2 to be able to hit it (running on the same host). If i use the dns name of the host running these two containers, pod2 resolves it to 127.0.0.1, and if i use the ip of the machine instead, then https doesnt work
[01:16:45] <motsu> since the cert doesnt match... if i could get pod2 to resolve the dns name as the actual host's IP and not localhost, then i believe everything would just work as expected

[01:25:13] <rawtaz> motsu: you want pod2 to connect to pod1?
[01:25:25] <rawtaz> how did you start these containers?
[01:25:50] <motsu> they are through docker compose. the host has an nginx reverse proxy handling https for pod1.
[01:26:32] <rawtaz> in that case, pod2 should be able to resolve the FQDN "pod1" and it should resolve and connect to the pod1 container assuming they are on the same network of course
[01:26:41] <motsu> ideally, pod2 hits the dns server, gets the host's ip, then tries to connect to the host, which will handle the https stuff correctly. problem is if i do the dns name for the host, pod2 gets 127.0.0.1 (inside the container) and never talks to anything outside the pod

[01:28:16] <DoofusCanadensis> ^
[01:28:22] <rawtaz> note: the above is assuming that pod1 and pod2 are the service names in your compose file
[01:28:48] <rawtaz> the internal docker dns server supplies  <service name> -> ip  resolution, which all containers in the solution can use
[01:30:23] <motsu> ah, ok... so the service name of pod1 is the same as the short hostname of the host with docker running on it. it appears that that takes precidence over the service name
[01:30:54] <rawtaz> can you please pastebin your docker-compose file?
[01:31:17] <DoofusCanadensis> oh yeah, don't confuse hostname with service name
[01:31:30] <motsu> there isn't a need for it to be, so ill change that and see if that is a work around. out of curiocity, is there a way to tell a container to not use any internal dns stuff and just use the network dns server?
[01:31:49] <DoofusCanadensis> I believe so, yes
[01:32:22] <DoofusCanadensis> https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/container-networking/#dns-services
[01:32:35] <DoofusCanadensis> you can override dns when starting up a container
[01:35:46] <motsu> cool, well ill try some stuff and ill see if any of it fixes the issue. re: confusing service names vs hostnames... for my internal network I name my vm's off of their function (ie homeassistant.xyz), the homeassistant vm has a bunch of docker containers on it (mqtt, zwave, node-red, and also homeassistant). i didnt think about a container being named homeassistant being problematic with the hostn
[01:35:50] <motsu> ame also being homeassistant
[01:36:50] <DoofusCanadensis> yeah
[01:37:08] <DoofusCanadensis> ideally, your vm could just be dockerhost-1, etc
[01:37:23] <DoofusCanadensis> or dockerhost-dateilaunchedthishost
[01:37:52] <DoofusCanadensis> in the future you should be able to stand up a new host and just migrate containers to it
[01:38:07] <DoofusCanadensis> soon, names become completely irrelevant

[03:50:20] <walkr> Hey there. I'm starting out with docker and I have a simple question I couldn't find the answer on google. The docker tutorial says on the "Multi container apps" section [https://docs.docker.com/get-started/07_multi_container] that both containers must be in the same network. Later on, the tutorial shows how to translate those running commands to a Docker compose. If I have a docker compose with an app and a service, are both in 
[03:50:20] <walkr> the same network by default?
[03:50:44] <motsu> rawtaz: a bit of a hack, but the docker-compose verb "extra_hosts" did the trick
[03:50:50] <motsu> thanks for the help :)
[03:51:28] <rawtaz> motsu: oh ok, so it adds extra hostnames to docker's internal dns?
[03:51:39] <rawtaz> baine101: may i ask what you use the coturn server for?
[03:51:46] <motsu> yeah, which took priority to the localhost issue
[03:51:50] <rawtaz> baine101: no, shouldnt make a difference
[03:52:28] <rawtaz> motsu: why not ditch the container_name in the first place? the entire point of docker-compose prefixing your containers and other resources with the project name and stuff is that they should be unique and not have a chance of colliding with others
[03:52:45] <baine101> rawtaz webrtc, i just setup my own instead of using googles
[03:53:26] <rawtaz> walkr: yeah unless you configure it differently, all services in one and the same compose file will share/be on the same network. thats the default. and that will be a network that is automatically created only for those containers, not colliding with any others

[03:54:47] <rawtaz> yw!
[03:55:13] <motsu> rawtaz: probably would have worked if it wasn't for the host networking... i forgot i did that since homeassistant is dual homed, and host networking was the easiest way to get that exposed to the container
[03:55:45] <rawtaz> baine101: you never answered my other question:  < rawtaz> how do you know that?  (php-fpm dosent fire up the .sock file)
[03:55:45] <motsu> the name thing just sets the name in docker to not be the auto generated one, so i would need that anyway if i was setting the hostname of 1 container in the settings of a second
[03:56:59] <baine101> rawtaz ive searched for the sock file using find and grep also ps || grep
[03:57:00] <rawtaz> motsu: if i had a container in a compose file that i wanted to "forward" a port into, i'd just put in the compose files a  ports:\n\s\s1234:1234  - that will forward the port on the host into the container
[03:57:24] <rawtaz> baine101: surely there must be some error messages or similar. have you looked into that? `docker-compose logs` e.g.
[03:58:15] <baine101> ive looked at the usual log places both inside and on the container
[03:59:08] <rawtaz> the container still runs though, right? it's just that php-fpm doesnt start (or does it, just doesnt fire up a socket?)?
[03:59:36] <baine101> the container runs fine just php-fpm doesnt start at all

[16:54:27] <garlopf> I want to create a context for interacting with swarm. I see the --default-stack-orchestrator argument is deprecated. How can I tell that I want a context to work with swarm?
[16:56:40] <aton`> is there a way to run a container (execute CMD) without having FROM and RUN executed again (i.e. the create part)?
[17:05:34] <garlopf> aton`, the FROM and RUN parts are only executed at build
[17:06:04] <garlopf> once built the image should be a stand lone entity that can be run as one or more containers
[17:06:52] <aton`> hm it seems the terminology is strange for me
[17:07:12] <garlopf> See this for an explanation; https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37513511/whats-the-difference-between-the-docker-commands-run-build-and-create
[17:07:30] <aton`> i just read that
[17:08:36] <garlopf> it is sometimes difficult to distinguish an image from a container. Think of an image as an "ISO" image. It is a static file. You then create a container from that image. The container is conceptually like a "virtual machine".
[17:09:14] <garlopf> then you start the container with the run command. Once started, any changes that occur will happen inside the container, not the image
[17:09:44] <aton`> and once the container finishes, the changes are lost?
[17:09:53] <garlopf> yes and no
[17:09:58] <garlopf> you can re-use container.
[17:10:04] <garlopf> if you delete the container then changes are gone
[17:10:48] <garlopf> usually we make images so that re-creating containers is easy and we don't rely on data inside container
[17:10:50] <garlopf> (stateless)
[17:11:04] <garlopf> mantra is: quick to start, safe to terminate
[17:12:19] <aton`> and images and containers are all managed by docker itself, right?
[17:12:38] <aton`> if i want to change an image, i change the Dockerfile and create a new image, right?
[17:12:42] <garlopf> yes. docker provides tools for building images and creating/running containers
[17:12:50] <garlopf> aton`, correct.
[17:13:01] <aton`> if i want to change a container, i get a bash inside
[17:13:11] <garlopf> an image is created FROM another image with extra commands RUN in a Dockerfile
[17:13:37] <garlopf> once you have the image you can PUSH the image to a registry
[17:13:49] <garlopf> and you can CREATE a container from the image
[17:13:58] <garlopf> and then START that container
[17:14:02] <aton`> yea the registry, that part is a bit creepy. is there a way to work without a registry?
[17:14:12] <aton`> i am not happy about sharing my containers with everyone
[17:14:13] <garlopf> ATTACH a shell to it to look inside it while it is running etc
[17:14:25] <garlopf> aton`, you can host your own registry
[17:14:46] <aton`> but no local mode, right?
[17:14:48] <garlopf> also you should make images that are not difficult to share (they should not have data inside them but be stateless)
[17:15:08] <aton`> garlopf: i should, but i cannot guarantee it happens
[17:15:17] *** Joins: Mattiaslndstrm (~Mattiasln@94.191.136.110.mobile.tre.se)
[17:15:21] <aton`> it *doesnt* happen
[17:15:24] <garlopf> I actually use gitlab,com free account which provides free private docker registry
[17:15:29] <garlopf> i am sure other providers have the same
[17:15:47] *** Quits: Mattiaslndstrm (~Mattiasln@94.191.136.110.mobile.tre.se) (Client Quit)
[17:15:47] <garlopf> also when running docker images you often want to depend on something like docker swarm or kubernetes
[17:16:10] <garlopf> as long as the swarm has accesss to your registry you should be able to run without sharing your secret images
[17:16:50] <garlopf> for small setups you could get away with something like digitalocean
[17:17:02] <garlopf> they have easy to set up registries/kubernetes etc
[17:17:31] <aton`> hm, i still dont like the idea of my virtual machines being uploaded somewhere
[17:17:50] <walkr> Hey there. I'm facing a weird issue. I'm a docker newbie, btw. I have a docker compose file that runs golang and mysql. The thing is that I cannot access the mysql container from the golang container, BUT I CAN access the mysql instance from my local machine. Does anyone have thoughts on this? 
[17:18:02] <walkr> This is my docker-compose.yaml https://0bin.net/paste/EzR6sx6V#KR1IiooYq9wehxC8lXgn9NT4YEtUDQYunZFD1yd5Xjb
[17:18:38] <aton`> garlopf: i think i have to read some more to understand the concept better. thanks for the explanation, was really helpful!
[17:18:53] <garlopf> aton`, the containers are not uploaded anywere, only the images

[17:19:31] <garlopf> aton`, np, it is all daunting in the start but very pleasing to work with once you get the hang of it
[17:21:08] <garlopf> walkr, first of all check that you don't have port conflicts with stuff running on your machine. This bit me in the ass coutnless times when I was a beginner

[17:21:59] <garlopf> walkr, probablye scenarioes; you run mysql locally on your host on same port, or you started several different compose files with mysql on same port 
[17:22:15] <aton`> garlopf: but the image contains all the fs layers already, right?

[17:22:31] <aton`> i.e. files that were copied in etc
[17:22:36] <garlopf> aton`, yes
[17:23:06] <garlopf> so if you have secret application, you might not want the image on public repo
[17:23:09] <aton`> so an image is basically a vm and a container is a running vm process
[17:23:18] <walkr> garlopf, thanks for the suggestion, I'll check the ports
[17:23:36] <garlopf> aton`, image is... image, container is vm instancve
[17:23:38] <garlopf> aton`, image is... image, container is vm instance
[17:23:39] <garlopf> ish
[17:24:19] <garlopf> walkr, to figure out use docker-compose ps and docker ps to look for existing stuff running and shut ut down
[17:24:53] <garlopf> and maybe run non standard ports for your setup just to make sure
[17:24:58] <garlopf> netstat is your friend also
[17:25:38] <walkr> garlopf, ok! All down. Only my docker-compose running. I changed the mysql port to 12332, so there is nothing else on it for sure.

[19:22:32] <programmerq> mike18: take a look at 'docker container prune', 'docker image prune', and 'docker volume prune'. There's also 'docker system prune' that combines that *and* the build caches.
[19:22:50] <programmerq> it removes non-running containers, unreferenced images, dangling volumes
[19:22:51] <mike18> is it harmful for current running containers?
[19:22:59] <programmerq> check out the --help for each one for more info
[19:23:09] <mike18> i have a lot of date in /var/lib/docker/volumes
[19:23:32] <mike18> it says Remove all unused local volumes
[19:23:38] <mike18> so kinda safe i would say
[19:23:45] <programmerq> that's the idea, yup!
