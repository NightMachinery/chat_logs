[18:42:38] <jxself> The GPL and AGPL are different licenses.

[18:51:59] <natewrench123456> it is based on the MPL, it will be file based copyleft but instead of trademark restrictions the license allows trademark use, and can offer warranty and liability

[18:53:00] <jxself> I feel confused now. You say you wanted "more" copyleft but are going with the MPL's weaker copyleft.

[19:08:55] <GNUtoo> iShareFreedom: CPU also have other things in the same chip nowadays, like GPUs
[19:09:06] <GNUtoo> but if you only consider the CPU the main issue is the microcode
[19:09:33] <GNUtoo> and it's often loaded by your BIOS first, but then there are no free software microcode updates for modern CPUs AFAIK
[19:09:42] <GNUtoo> And both AMD and Intel do use microcode updates

[19:47:11] <GNUtoo> Without nonfree firmware you don't have 3D acceleration on older GPUs, and newer GPUs don't work at all or work with very limited drivers like VESA or efifb because they are not added in linux-libre
[19:47:18] <GNUtoo> (for AMD/ATI)
[19:47:31] <GNUtoo> For Intel I don't have very modern computers so I don't know
