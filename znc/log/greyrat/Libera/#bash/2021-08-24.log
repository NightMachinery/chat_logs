[10:55:13] <greybot> "set -e" is an inheritance of the old bourne shell, and doesn't really work well with modern shell features. You'll really have less buggy scripts if you do the error handling manually instead of relying on the unreliable "set -e"; see http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/105

[10:59:08] <greybot> ''set -u'' or ''set -o nounset'', makes the use of unset variables sometimes cause a fatal error. If you want to detect typoed variable names, use shellcheck instead. See http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/112

[19:31:10] <Soliton> ^H is probably supposed to be backspace.
[19:31:13] <TomyWork> yeah
[19:31:37] <TomyWork> but how old does the shell have to be and which shells are vulnerable?
[19:31:39] <Soliton> probably configurable in putty.
[19:31:41] <selckin> which usually means like $TERM setting
[19:31:49] <selckin> or puttyness
[19:32:11] <TomyWork> it is putty. putty has 2 settings. neither causes the issue in bash or ksh93
[19:32:25] <Soliton> i doubt the shell is involved.
[19:32:34] <TomyWork> what would be involved?
[19:32:46] <Soliton> the terminal
[19:33:29] *** Quits: LuksNuke (~user@85.93.217.190) (Ping timeout: 248 seconds)
[19:34:04] <TomyWork> putty can send either 7f or ctrl-h as backspace. neither causes bash to append a literal 7f to the current command line.
[19:34:29] *** Joins: LuksNuke (~user@85.93.217.190)
[19:34:34] <selckin> $TERM is basically the protocol version
[19:34:48] <selckin> so check what they use, and if what putty set it too is supported
[19:35:35] <TomyWork> if i connect my putty to my linux machine, TERM is "xterm"
[19:35:48] <emanuele6> # bind -p | grep -F -- '"\C-h"'
[19:35:50] <shbot> emanuele6: "\C-h": backward-delete-char
[19:36:03] <emanuele6> bash's readline binds \C-h to backward-delete-char
[19:36:08] <emanuele6> so maybe it is the shell
[19:36:21] <selckin> TomyWork: /usr/share/terminfo should have a xterm file then in $linux, try setting it to the basic vt100 vt220
[19:36:34] <emanuele6> i mean it is bash that avoids the problem

[20:28:31] <Swahili> Q: is there a command to check the latest exit code from the previous exec cmd?
[20:28:34] <llua> for arg in ... __; if [[ $arg == __ ]] ...
[20:29:02] <Swahili> seems that> echo $?
[20:29:09] <Swahili> works out, I'll test it
[20:29:13] <Soliton> !$?
[20:29:13] <greybot> The special parameter ? (expanded by $?) holds the exit status of the last synchronous command.
[20:29:46] <Soliton> utis: add a trap that kills them.

[23:18:14] <_crazygirl> It is very difficult for you to believe me at once, because of the negative primacy induced by TV. Wake up and save your life. You are facing a global genocide that many have already confirmed, it is through vaccines.
[23:18:14] <_crazygirl> Some are placebo, but most carry poison. If you have already been vaccinated, search the antidote. Both of them: VACCINES of flu 2019 and all those of COVID carry POISON to kill us. All the media + WHO + Bill Gates conspired to reduce population.
[23:18:14] <_crazygirl> According to one of the professors who has analyzed the vaccine (with digital signature), Dr. Campra, (NOT the University of Almera) says that it contains graphene oxide, pure poison. In addition to killing, and sterilizing, if you are still alive, graphene takes control of your brain.
[23:18:14] <_crazygirl> Those vaccinated cannot donate blood. Mobile phones, if they are older than 2017, detect all those vaccinated by blueetooth. do the magnet test. The poison acts from six months of inoculation to three years. Find out on TELEGRAM,  the only medium UNCENSORED. Find telegram channels in win-war.org (List of dissident groups)
