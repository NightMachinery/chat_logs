[21:11:21] <Delf> I was not being ironic when I put thoughtful inside double quotes. I was just having difficulty finding a suitable word.
[21:15:42] <pussipupu> No, "conscience" isn't outsourcing
[21:16:25] <pussipupu> Honestly I don't see how one could come to the conclusion it was, unless one was assuming it was created by a third party

[21:20:34] <pussipupu> Hmm, one's sense of right and wrong in terms of one's own actions more specifically I guess
[21:21:10] <Delf> Interesting...
[21:22:35] <Delf> I see it as a mechanism belonging to the part of the mind that is responsible for producing emotions. Your use of the word SENSE in sense of right and wrong is sensible to me.

[21:25:53] <pussipupu> An understandable typo in the context :þ
[21:26:33] <pussipupu> So you think it belongs somehow to “the part of the mind which produces emotions” (which I'm also not sure I find meaningful), but what do you think it /is/?
[21:26:42] <Delf> May or may not be conscious of, as in aware.
[21:26:47] <pussipupu> Just the reflexive judgement without the reflective part?
[21:27:40] <pussipupu> Our reflexive judgements of course evolve to come into line with our reflective opinions too, both through conscious effort and general antipathy to dissonance
[21:28:46] <Delf> Yes, but it takes time for them to come into line with our opinions
[21:29:02] <pussipupu> Sure, and the tension works both ways
[21:29:47] <Delf> If we're... relaxed in our "presence", yes.
[21:30:11] <pussipupu> If you mean by “conscience” what might be called “gut conscience” with my definition, then I disagree that it's lost through reasoning, though it will tend to become more nuanced and complex

[21:32:28] <brigand> right, sorry
[21:32:36] <brigand> heh
[21:32:54] <Delf> Maybe it is not the same with others but my emotions subside the more I become present/alert.
[21:33:42] <pussipupu> Well also we're using the word differently, though perhaps not radically so
[21:34:25] <pussipupu> Looking at is as Type-1 and Type-2 reasoning, I'm counting both as within the remit of conscience and you're only counting the former(if I'm understanding you right)
[21:34:47] <pussipupu> If one has the time to consider, and is in a calmer emotional state, then Type-2 will tend to dominate
[21:35:00] <Delf> I change my values in accordance with I consider to be relevant. I do not depend on external sources to decide what is right and/or wrong if it's important things. I do however seek information from others.
[21:35:31] <pussipupu> (though I'm inclined to view this dichotomy as a useful lens but not necessarily a Thing-in-the-world in a meaningful sense)

[21:38:40] <Delf> Then in that case I probably do have a conscience but I do not feel it much at all
[21:39:26] <Delf> Since my quick approximate reasoning is in accordance with my slow and reflective reasoning.
[21:43:54] <Delf> It's just easier for me to put focus on my values instead
