[04:50:46] <jiffy> hi all, i've removed freenode from my conf via webadmin but '/msg *status Rehash' does not work, what am I doing wrong, does that command no longer work from  irc ? it's been a while since I had to do anything with znc. 
[04:50:50] *** Gustavo6046_ is now known as Gustavo6046
[04:51:59] <KindOne> All you have to do is remove it via webadmin and save, you don't need to use REHASH
[04:52:47] <jiffy> thanks, but I'm still on freenode. :) I'll double check my webadmin as something must be wrong.
[04:53:12] <jiffy> just to be clear, so when I remove from webadmin I should just die on freenode?
[04:53:17] <jiffy> not literally I hope
[04:53:25] <DarthGandalf> no rehash needed for that
[04:53:32] <DarthGandalf> yes, it should disconnect you
[04:53:40] <DarthGandalf> maybe you're connected directly, ignoring ZNC? ;)
[04:53:59] <jiffy> I don't think so but I'll check thx
[04:54:29] <jiffy> I set all this up years ago and it's just 'worked' so not had to do anything much :p
[04:55:03] <jiffy> I managed to add this network though so that's a plus :D
[04:55:33] <DarthGandalf> you probably should upgrade the version
[04:56:22] <jiffy> what and break what works !
[04:56:24] <jiffy> ;)
[04:58:17] <jiffy> I will try to find time, maybe once I get a bit more familiar with it again I may attempt it.
[04:59:04] <MetaNova> version upgrading should be painless
[04:59:41] <jiffy> 'should' being the important word there for me.
[04:59:54] <MetaNova> as in, regardless of how you installed it, there's nothing much to (re)configure between version upgrades
[05:00:06] <MetaNova> it's third-party modules which might need to be recompiled
[05:00:09] <jiffy> does it keep my conf intact
[05:00:15] <MetaNova> yes
[05:00:25] <MetaNova> and if you're paranoid, just make a copy/backup of ~/.znc
[05:00:59] <MetaNova> (or whichever datadir your instance is using)
[05:01:39] <jiffy> ok thx, I will put it on my list of things to do
[05:02:23] <MetaNova> there might be the odd exception such as partyline being removed and you run into a conf error - because it's trying to load a module which doesn't exist, fatal run error
[05:04:00] <MetaNova> I've continually upgraded the same original conf I made from 0.206 to present (1.9.x)
[05:06:01] <jiffy> that rings a bell for the last time I installed and I had to remove it from the conf, so maybe this install is not as old as I think, shell providers come and go unfortutately, now down to one, I think I had 5 back in the day of building eggdrop botnets.
[05:06:18] <gothkat> i think we hit some sort of problem upgrading too many versions at once. it wasn't partyline but maybe it was another module that didn't make the upgrade. don't remember the details though because i have people for that.
[05:06:41] <DarthGandalf> special people to remember details?
[05:07:07] <jiffy> I wish I had 'people'.
[05:07:27] <MetaNova> I was about to say, I'd love to have people do things for me
[05:07:51] <gothkat> people to fix the things i break
[05:11:12] <jiffy> I just found a note from the last install, it's a very long cmd for upgrading znc on my xzibition shell so i must have come into problems, this is seperate to the partyline thing.
[05:12:20] <MetaNova> if your specific shell requires certain installation, you should refer to them about version upgrades
[05:12:37] <gothkat> i got a shellscript with a note to put anything i break back before i complain. seems fair. it upgrades and recompiles modules and everything for me
[05:17:33] <jiffy> yes, it looks library related, maybe it's in a different location to what znc expected, gcc49 what ever that is.
[05:18:32] <MetaNova> if I were to guess that's gcc 4.9 it's specifically calling

[05:26:25] <Khaytsus> yeah, work I have one single notes doc I just dump stuff into, don't annotate it as well as I could, but generally can find something I did a month ago I've forgotten the details of, etc

[05:29:41] <jiffy> I try to keep relevant stuff but I'm in it ops so so much is just noise and if I'm off shift there is no way I'm doing more than a quick scan when I get back.
[05:29:51] <gothkat> 159K in deleted items? screw it just wait for a database crash and let it go then
[05:30:26] <jiffy> I was hoping to get to 1m and when I leave hit delete just before I go.
[05:30:42] <Khaytsus> And burn the internet as it tries
[05:30:52] <DarthGandalf> Khaytsus: my inbox has tens of thousands of unread emails
[05:30:53] <jiffy> should keep the exchange server busy for a bit

[14:07:16] <DarthGandalf> Or, step outside of your zone of comfort and learn something new
[14:07:45] <dimi1947> the one I am more confortable with is windows and as you might guess this is unavailable

[14:08:31] <TheFatherMind> I just run mine in a docker container
[14:09:30] <kushal> dimi1947, get CentOS8 or Debian Buster for longer time running then.

[14:11:29] <Casper> Yeah, that's not going to run Windows, no. I'd suggest Debian too :p
[14:12:11] <kushal> dimi1947, so Debian 10 or CentOS8 
[14:12:14] <kushal> both are good. 
[14:12:16] <dimi1947> why debian?
[14:13:11] <bookworm> I'd advise against it, too old packages

[14:15:19] <dimi1947> cannot decide...debian or ubuntu
[14:15:46] <kushal> Ubuntu 20.04 will give you around 2 years till next big OS upgrade. 
[14:16:17] <Lartza> And Debian 10 will give you three
[14:16:28] <kushal> dimi1947, ^^ so you choose :)
[14:16:43] <Lartza> Wait... I wonder if my VPS is on Debian 8 or 9 o.o

[15:36:45] <Lartza> Don't think that matters on a server either
[15:36:49] <Lartza> On a desktop Ubuntu might be nicer
[15:37:02] <Lartza> Either is arguably easy as anything
[15:37:15] <r00tobo> even on a server, lots of tutorials and issues are solved on Ubuntu
[15:37:58] <r00tobo> if you look up a linux problem on google 80% of the results are coming from askubuntu or someone is using ubuntu on another forum 
[15:39:17] <Lartza> I think we'll just have to agree to disagree. That just means Ubuntu is more popular, which it of course is especially on desktop
[15:40:13] <r00tobo> I also see people here complaining about old packages with Debian, haven't they heard about backports before ? :p
[15:40:53] <MetaNova> I don't have a problem with old packages in my gentoo install

[15:47:44] <dimi1947> easy
[15:47:46] <dimi1947> yes
[15:48:26] <r00tobo> great then you can order some subdomain for free and assign 2 popular record for your server instead of using the IP directly
[15:48:33] <r00tobo> records*
[15:49:58] <r00tobo> one A record  for your server's IPv4 and one AAAA record for your server's IPv6
[15:52:00] <dimi1947> I do not quite follow...I  know what DNS but not much details...better look into it when  I set up the VPS..for now I am covered
[15:52:46] <r00tobo> you still didn't setup anything ?
[15:53:01] <dimi1947> no
[15:53:14] <dimi1947> just gather info

[15:57:12] <The_Blode> I have setup znc on my Pi but when I logged into my client today, I only saw about an hour worth of chat. Do I need to increase the buffer size to preserve more chat history?
[15:57:30] <r00tobo> Yes
[15:57:45] <The_Blode> r00tobo, thanks. The current buffer is set to 50
[15:57:50] <The_Blode> What unit of measure is this?
[15:57:53] <flausch> The_Blode, 50 lines
[15:57:54] <The_Blode> lines? bytes?
[15:58:00] <r00tobo> yeah I was going to say it's 50 by default

[16:12:47] <flausch> ok, sasl actually works much better then nickserv
[16:16:22] <MetaNova> yes it does
[16:16:34] <flausch> love it
[16:16:52] <flausch> i will redeploy znc behind traefik to get rid of my virtual machines
[16:16:59] <flausch> love there is a guide for this
[16:17:34] <MetaNova> the *nickserv module has one single advantage over *sasl - if services split/restart and you are not seen as having been previously identified, and are asked to identify by NickServ, the *nickserv module should at that point notice the prompt from NickServ and identify you
[16:18:07] <MetaNova> fortunately, this is a considerably rare occurrence
[16:18:16] <MetaNova> and it doesn't outweigh the benefits of *sasl
[16:18:50] <MetaNova> (you can, if you wanted, have both *sasl and *nickserv loaded, but this will generate additional "you are already identified" messages from NickServ every time ZNC connects)
[16:25:09] <flausch> MetaNova, I think i will stick with only sasl and maybe just reconnect if this really happens at some point.
