[14:30:13] <bremner> no idea, I don't know who is "in charge" of that.
[14:31:10] <bremner> looks very out of date, and out of sync with the original notmuch bindings
[14:32:35] <bremner> maybe ping the maintainer? they seem to have wandered off
[14:33:10] <bremner> currently it would be better to delete the module from pypi than the status quo
[14:41:16] <gauteh[m]> ok.. is alot on notmuch2 bindings? at the moment it seems kind of hard to rely on them, because they are not easily available.
[14:47:44] <bremner> alot is, yeah
[14:48:28] <bremner> the notmuch module on pypi is also pretty out of date, btw
[14:48:41] <gauteh[m]> ok
[14:48:59] <bremner> I guess it hasn't changed much though.
[14:53:24] <bremner> I think _just_ the python bindings without a recent notmuch won't help that much. Some kind of backport / PPA is probably better than pypi
[14:54:31] <angry_vincent> can anyon share or point to good guide/howto/tutorial on stting up emacs + notmuch + gmail. i know emacs and notmuch are very good together, but gmail i am not sure
[14:55:14] <bremner> angry_vincent: there is a bridge to gmail called lieer, I suggest checking its docs

[15:04:13] <rdbeni0> hi all
[15:04:37] <bremner> hello.
[15:05:37] <rdbeni0> i just started using notmuch (with isync and emacs) and got some problems
[15:05:44] <rdbeni0> or questions
[15:06:52] <bremner> ask away. Depending on the questions, you might have to wait a bit for answers
[15:06:53] <rdbeni0> lets say i run isync and got emails from gmail in dedicated folders, for example "family" (folders, not gmail tags). so mail dir is ./emailname/Family/cur/<mail_file_in_isync_format>
[15:07:14] <rdbeni0> but email inside this filder are without tags "family"
[15:07:24] <rdbeni0> and this is for existing - not for "new" emails
[15:07:51] <rdbeni0> so i have around 300 mails in "Family" folder
[15:08:09] <rdbeni0> as i understand, i need to run query to find all emails in "Family" and add +family
[15:08:12] <rdbeni0> correct?
[15:08:46] <bremner> that sounds reasonable. something like notmuch tag +family -- folder:Family
[15:09:08] <bremner> although I'm not sure what the underlying issue is
[15:09:18] <rdbeni0> exactly, this is what i though
[15:09:22] <rdbeni0> not issue
[15:09:24] <rdbeni0> just asking
[15:22:48] <rdbeni0> other question, in emacs i have something like : https://i.imgur.com/ASH5pg3.png
[15:23:21] <rdbeni0> in the title, it seems that it is something like embedded image
[15:23:39] <rdbeni0> it is possible to handle it?
[15:24:51] <bremner> rdbeni0: that looks like a font problem. Emacs is missing some unicode characters in your default font set
[15:25:55] <rdbeni0> https://i.imgur.com/uYCBWRt.png
[15:26:02] <rdbeni0> this is how it looks in "real" webmail
[15:26:07] <bremner> Maybe as a test you could try "DejaVu Sans Mono" as your default font.
[15:26:19] <rdbeni0> ok
[15:26:45] <bremner> I don't know about those specific characters, but it has pretty good unicode coverage.
[15:26:59] <rdbeni0> thanks
[15:27:12] <rdbeni0> which font are you using? as advanced notmuch user? :D
[15:27:21] <bremner> that's the one I use
[15:27:51] <rdbeni0> ok, thanks
[15:27:54] <bremner> If the characters are not in DejaVu, I guess you'll have to consult #emacs for font suggestions.
[15:28:33] <rdbeni0> ok, got it. Thank you
[15:30:30] <angry_vincent> you may need to install noto font
[15:31:05] <angry_vincent> it will then add missing unicode symbols, even for dejavu
[15:33:15] <rdbeni0> i am using hack right now : https://github.com/source-foundry/Hack and really like it... but as you can see it seems that this is not covering all utf-8 characters ;/
[15:33:29] <angry_vincent> Yes
[15:33:49] <rdbeni0> i will try noto
[15:33:50] <angry_vincent> noto will fill missing symbols, try it
[15:33:53] <bremner> yes, "programmer fonts" seem mostly bad at unicode
[15:33:56] <rdbeni0> thanks for suggestion
[15:34:07] <bremner> probably that says something bad about tech
[15:34:09] <angry_vincent> so that you need no to change font at all
[15:34:21] <angry_vincent> but miisng unicode will be filled up
[15:34:33] <angry_vincent> not sure how exactly it playing together
[15:39:15] <bremner> TIL running the test suite in parallel is sometimes slower than serially
[15:40:12] <rdbeni0> i have some questions about trash/gmail/deletion - but will ask later (now i am in real work, coding some boring python)

[16:04:30] <Domo> I also use hack, many glyphs (of not all) after 0xffff are not available
[16:08:15] <Domo> hmm, could configure rxvt-unicode to use dejavu as fallback (uxrvt is the place where I usually see fonts not rendered (there it just shows square)
[16:18:41] <gour> i fetch mail fro 5 accounts - 3 are mine. in order to see only my email, the solution seems to be to e.g. run afew and tag e.g. +imap the mail for accounts/mail which will be accessed with gui (evolution) client
[16:19:16] <bremner> you can also use folders as searches
[16:19:50] <bremner> (assuming you drop the different accounts in different folders)
[16:20:47] <gour> yeah, but it seems simpler to just use one +tag to have 'unified' inbox
[16:21:53] <gour> i've tried mimic notmuch with mu4e, but it's simply another league...now just have to configure multiple identities (using message-templ) and then i'll ride 😄

[18:40:17] <gour> it looks that i've solved my issue with notmuch+evil-mode
[18:40:28] <gour> the solution is called: god-mode :smile
[18:41:15] <bremner> ah. interesting. I guess it depends how addicted to vim bindings people are
[18:41:31] <inwit> How's that, gour? In god-mode you retain hjkl?

[23:02:39] <acdw> what's the best way to get notmuch count in the emacs mode-line? display-time-mode looks at a file... any ideas?
[23:03:45] <bremner> maybe look at what org mode does for various timers ?
[23:04:32] <bremner> the actual invocation of notmuch count can be stolen from notmuch-hello.el
[23:10:04] <acdw> aha, thanks
