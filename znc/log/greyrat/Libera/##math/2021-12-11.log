[03:28:39] <[itchyjunk]> idk how to simplify to what the problem has but i think i get the same thing?
[03:28:41] <Guest78> LTCD case 1 + case 2 + case 3
[03:28:51] <Guest78> case2 amd case3 are the same
[03:29:03] <Guest78> 1+1 = 2sort of thing
[03:29:08] <[itchyjunk]> z = 2pi n - i ln(2 + sqrt(3)) and z = 2pim - i ln ( 2 - sqrt(3))
[03:29:31] <LTCD> Guest78 Yeah, I understand case2 and case3 are the same so they did 2() on the first line.
[03:29:47] <Guest78> yes
[03:30:05] <LTCD> It's how that became the second line I am unsure of Guest78

[03:31:44] <LTCD> Guest78 How does thisÂ  2(6! / (2! 2!)) become this 6!/2! ?
[03:32:00] <Guest78> 2! = 2 * 1 = 2
[03:32:20] <Guest78> 2 / 2!Â  = 2 / (2*1) = 1/1 = 1

[03:35:33] <somiaj> [itchyjunk]: show and solve do not need to be the same thing, you just need to show that cos( 2n pi +- i ln(2 + sqrt(3)) ) = 2, so just compute this out using the complex definition of cos(z) in terms of e^(iz)

[05:24:55] <quartz> Can someone please explain to me the purpose of "c" in this definition of a polynomial time verifier? https://i.ibb.co/RpNDfz6/image.png
[05:25:04] <quartz> Why is c a string and not a boolean?
[05:26:37] <somiaj> well languages are subsets of strings over some alphabet. Why would you think it would be boolean?
[05:26:52] *** Joins: AimHere (~David@vpn-fn-224.net.ed.ac.uk)
[05:28:36] <quartz> Because the definition says "c" is used to verify that "w" is a member of A
[05:28:48] <quartz> So why can't the verifier just verify that w is in A without using C?
[05:28:56] <quartz> I don't get why c is a string
[05:29:54] <somiaj> well V shouldn't accept a bool, so it wouldn't make sense for v to accept a true/false value, but to return it
[05:30:26] <quartz> Right
[05:30:55] *** Quits: Guest80 (~Guest80@S01069050ca4e3573.cg.shawcable.net) (Quit: Connection closed)
[05:31:05] <somiaj> so it seems a verifier takes as an input not only the string w you want to check, but another string, called a certificate. Though not quite sure how it uses that secondary string (sorry I read it to fast at start and though w was the length of the string)
[05:31:18] <biberao> gn
[05:31:53] <quartz> Yeah I'm not sure what it does with the secondary string either.
[05:32:01] *** Joins: Guest80 (~Guest80@S01069050ca4e3573.cg.shawcable.net)
[05:32:32] <somiaj> maybe the certificate is some sort of encryption, so y ou need that along with the encrypted string w to verify it, i.e. it isn't as straight forward as just checking if w is in A
[05:34:49] <somiaj> this site seems to give another definition, so 'w in A iff exists string c that V accepts <w,c>'
[05:35:04] <somiaj> http://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs103/cs103.1152/lectures/25/Small25.pdf -- a quick google search, that seems to make slightly more sense to me than what you posted

[17:49:44] <bollu> I'm trying to understand cell decompsotions of the grassmanian G(2, 4). Why is it that we never consider the case where one of the vectors are all zeroes? Eg, the case of (1 0 0 0)(0 0 0 0)?
[17:50:04] <bollu> There seems to be some notion of "non degeneracy" somehow, but the definitio of the grassmanian doesn't have this condition?
[17:51:14] <joel135> the notion of dimension of a span of a list of vectors does capture degeneracy
[17:52:52] <bollu> Actually, I think I have an even more basic confusion than that. Does, say, projective 1 space [x y] allow the tuple [0 0]? If so, what line in 1D does this correspond to?
[17:53:09] <joel135> it forbids [0 0]
[17:53:15] <bollu> I see
[17:53:41] <bollu> So, what is the precise definition of projective space? I thought it was R^2 with a quotient by scaling of R^x
[17:53:50] <bollu> But this definition seems to permit [0 0]
[17:53:56] <bollu> So the definition I have in mind must be wrong
[17:53:59] <joel135> ... precisely because the span of [0 0] is not 1-dimensional
[17:54:09] <bollu> Yeah, it's the same confusion again :)
[17:54:17] <bollu> Which is why I reduced it to this case
[17:54:33] <bollu> So, like, where is the flaw in the above "algebraic" definition of projective space I gave?
[17:54:36] <cherim> "2" in G(2, 4) means 2-dimensional subspaces. (1 0 0 0)(0 0 0 0) generates a 1-dimensional subspace.
[17:55:00] <joel135> you need R^2 \ {0} instead of R^2

[18:00:01] <bollu> And for the grassmanian, how do I "algebraically" ask for the same condition? Does the construction of Gr(2, 4) as "take all two forms (v /\ w) and then build projective space over these two forms" get the job done?

[20:13:05] <sek> isekaijin: I think any field you want: think of conics without a point in char 0 for example
[20:13:30] <sek> being k-rational really forces the existence of a ton of k-points on X_k
[20:14:03] <Franciman> in game theory being rational is exciting
[20:14:10] <Franciman> it does not mean belonging to Q
[20:14:12] <Franciman> :')
[20:14:28] <sek> curiously it also does not mean "belong to Q" in what isekaijin was talking about :)
[20:14:55] <Franciman> being rational means being birational to P^n
[20:14:57] <Franciman> right?
[20:15:00] <sek> yes
[20:15:02] <Franciman> ^^'
[20:15:08] <Franciman> alg geometry is exciting

[20:16:35] <sek> ah, apologies
[20:17:05] <sek> well tbf every couple of weeks I get a chat highlight of someone complaining (trolling?) about what the point of algebraic geometry is
[20:17:28] <Franciman> tell them about galois theory
[20:17:32] <river> it's a valid complaint
[20:17:36] <Franciman> that's the juicy thing they need
[20:17:47] <Franciman> to get rolled on the alg. geom. way
[20:17:55] <Franciman> galois theory is very juicy
[20:17:59] <sek> Franciman: anyway, being birational to P^n is a very strong condition. Why would we want to know why a variety is isomorphic to P^n? Well P^n is one of the simplest varieties, so something is rational if it's simple
[20:18:19] <Franciman> P^n doesn't look simple ahahahah
[20:18:23] <Franciman> but I trust you
[20:18:25] <Franciman> I am not expert
[20:18:49] <sek> it's just a "compact" form of k^n, is the set of n-tuples of elements in a field
[20:18:55] <Franciman> ah I forgot that
[20:18:56] <sek> idk if there's anything much simpler than this
[20:19:03] <Franciman> k^n is birational to P^n too
[20:19:10] <Franciman> so i am actually saying birational to k^n
[20:19:15] <sek> right
[20:19:18] <Franciman> but P^n may be easier to deal with

[20:21:06] <Franciman> nice
[20:21:50] <sek> eg, if I consider f(x,y) a cubic equation, is the fraction field of k[x,y]/(f(x,y)) isomorphic to a field of the form k(t1,t2)?
[20:22:02] <Franciman> you solve this
[20:22:05] <Franciman> with birationality
[20:22:11] <sek> this is called Luroth's problem and the answer is yes
[20:22:22] <Franciman> because birational curves iff birational fraction fields
[20:22:41] <Franciman> so are you asking for <f(x,y)> to be birational to P^2
[20:22:41] <river> sek, what does that do for elliptic curves?
[20:22:43] <Franciman> right?
[20:22:54] <river> oh is that the funky P lattice you get
[20:22:58] <river> weierstrass
[20:24:15] <sek> Oh sorry, I meant f(x,y,z) a cubic in *3* variables, is k[x,y,z]/(f) iso to something of the form k(t1,t2). For f(x,y,z,w) a cubic in 4 variables it's an extremely deep result but for f(x,y,z,w,t) a cubic in 5 variables it's an open problem
[20:24:43] <sek> river: you're right, in 2 variables f(x,y) is an elliptic curve (if f is smooth), and in this case the answer is no

[20:27:41] <Franciman> you were used to study planes, circles, parabolas
[20:27:44] <sek> so for 2 variables it's false that the fraction field of k[x,y]/f(x,y) is of the form k(t1), whereas in 3 variables it's true that Frac(k[x,y,z]/f)=k(t1,t2), in 4 variables it's false that Frac(k[x,y,z]/f)=k(t1,t2,t3), whereas the analogous result in 5 variables is a very active current area of research
