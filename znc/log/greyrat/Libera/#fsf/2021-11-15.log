[00:01:02] <Noisytoot> natewrench, I think that only the copyright holder can sue for license violations.
[00:01:17] <anonymous> you're wrong Noisytoot
[00:03:03] <anonymous> if the software release under GPLv3 there is no way to sue, the only violations possible are: 1, not including the license in your version. 2, sublicensing - not allowed - in that case your license becomes invalid but in no way allow the original copyright holder who waived his copyrights to sue you! 
[00:05:24] <Noisytoot> anonymous, Only the copyright holder can sue for license violations, but the user can sue for contract violations.
[00:05:30] <Noisytoot> So is the GPL a license or a contract?

[00:05:51] <anonymous> MIT does allow sublicensing, but not GPLv3, you can for example relicense Bitcoin from MIT to GPLv3 without any problem, in the other hand MIT is not an international license whereas GPLv3 is international meaning you will be protected worldwide. 
[00:06:32] <Noisytoot> You can't relicense anything you don't hold copyright for.
[00:06:50] <anonymous> You can't force anyone to accept your nonsense "contract" when you release the software or sold it under GPLv3, in that case you have all rights which guaranteed by GPLv3
[00:07:27] <Noisytoot> Yes.
[00:07:44] <anonymous> MIT license specifically allows you to sublicense meaning you can relicense it under GPLv3 without any problem if you state that the original work was licensed under MIT! 
[00:08:19] <Noisytoot> You still have to comply with the MIT/Expat license.

[00:09:21] <anonymous> Yes, you have to keep the MIT license in place but apart from that nothing can prevent you distributing your software under any other compatible license example GPLv3
[00:10:38] <Neopolitan> Am I causing anyone wanting to use my stuff with GPL problems if I use an MIT license?
[00:11:06] <natewrench> Neopolitan no MIT is as close to Public Domain, just attribution

[00:12:03] <anonymous> You can sublicense MIT with GPLv3 but you can't sublicense GPLv3!
[00:12:35] <natewrench> anonymous unless it has the "or any later version" clause, plus you can link it with AGPLv3
[00:13:02] <anonymous> natewrench that's a different thing, now you talk about AGPLv3
[00:13:27] <Neopolitan> i use mit rather than gpl because sometimes i use solutions from stackoverflow and im not confident legally how that code is released
[00:13:37] <natewrench> true Neopolitan
[00:13:42] <Neopolitan> * that code (or code snippets) is released
[00:14:00] <anonymous> or any later version means that if a new version of GPL license becomes available you allow anyone to update the GPL license to that newer version. GPLv3-only doesn't allow this. 
[00:14:23] <natewrench> if you want something libre forever then the GPL or MPL is reccommended, those are the only two free copyleft licenses i know of

[09:06:07] <leah> GPLv3 is a great license
[09:07:16] * leah was going to say more, but realizes now that she is reading an old chat log from 8 hours ago
[09:10:02] <leah> what i was going to say: its gplv4 you need to be wary of. i say, give it until lp2022 to assess the strength and nature of the fsf. it will have no way to hide; either it goes ahead, and we see, or gets cancelled and we... see harder. we will know by lp2022 and beyond, what the true consequences have been as a result of this year's events. if the fsf ends up appearing to be stable and reliable long
[09:10:04] <leah> term, GPLv3-or-later is a fine gamble. otherwise, i'd go with GPLv3-only
[09:10:56] <leah> the gamble is an assumption that v4 would present itself as a real improvement, and not a downgrade, and that it won't do something crazy
[09:11:25] <DiffieHellman> That's a fine gamble to take for me.
[09:11:54] <leah> i've recently decided i want to license all my projects as much as possible. to re-license my parts under v3-only
[09:12:10] <leah> v3-only and v3+ are compatible, afaict
[09:14:11] <leah> but i'm studying everything first to make sure it's all kosher, before I do so. that is, to remove all "or later" statements
[09:15:05] <leah> what makes me curious is: can i rewrite a file from scratch, having looked at the previous version of the file, prior to rewrite, and claim exclusive copyright ownership on the rewritten file

[09:24:07] <kittyblam> the GPL would be great if it was stronger, and a bit more open to concepts like the social domain imo. def not a bad choice tho from what ive seen at all
[09:25:06] <kittyblam> stronger absolutely not as in SSPL or something, but rather more willing to take a stronger stand to other problems
[09:26:18] <leah> i think the gpl should stay put and not change at all, personally
[09:26:31] <leah> i don't see any need for a v4
[09:26:58] <kittyblam> a v4 would be necessary if any legal bullshit happens, or if any massive unprecendeted problem comes up
[09:27:53] <kittyblam> right now while its not a bad license, corporations or other malicious groups still aren't completely protected against, if any of those weak points became a massive issue it would be essential to be able to not force that issue

[09:37:41] <kittyblam> federation in what regard?
[09:37:44] <leah> i start a thread on libreplanet-discuss recently. infrastructure exists for federated social media and such
[09:37:49] <leah> but i'm thinking more like... git
[09:37:51] <kittyblam> yeah

[09:37:59] <leah> event planning
[09:38:01] <kittyblam> we need to federate everything to a much stronger level
[09:38:03] <leah> between people/organisations
[09:38:18] <leah> i want to build this
[09:38:58] <leah> whaot inspired me to go ahead with my dream is forgefed. it's on forgefed.peers.community, based on activitypub, for federated code collaboration
[09:39:22] <leah> all that needs to happen is for the various forges like gitlab, sourcehut and gitea to implement it
[09:39:29] <kittyblam> frankly right now there needs to be a strong push for that type of decentralization on every level, stronger licenses that are also more open to change, etc.

[09:40:26] <leah> that's bad

[09:41:45] <kittyblam> right now there is little integrity imo, and too much of a circlejerk of reliance on corporations that do more damage than good

[09:46:43] <kittyblam> I think the biggest problem right now is just too much contentness, reliance on corporations, and a lack of re-examining what free software means. Free software should still be considered free even if large corporations are explicitely not allowed to modify nor distribute, in fact I argue letting these groups do what they do restricts freedoms *more*.

[10:31:39] <leah> that's not the most important question
[10:32:09] <leah> the most critical matter is frontend javascript. the way those plugins work, stripe sends javascript client code to the user's browser, and it's non-free
[10:32:15] <leah> even if your woo plugin is free

Cleaning things up a bit, replacing bitcoin with more ethical and accesible crypto, and maybe experimenting with a mutual credit system might make sense tho
[11:37:12] <leah> kittyblam: i want free money
[11:37:36] <kittyblam> a mutual credit system can fill that niche better than money can.
[11:37:48] <leah> free as in freedom
[11:38:00] <kittyblam> and that is absolutely possible to do free as in freedom
[11:38:35] <kittyblam> to do it primitively all you need is a pen and paper, or a verbal contract. To do more advanced things the software can absolutely be made free, I think offset credit made an attempt although I havent looked too close on that in particular

[11:39:33] <kittyblam> yes
[11:39:58] <kittyblam> with mutual credit systems you don't have to touch a bank nor even credit union (the better banks)
[11:39:59] <leah> it's actually fascinating when you look into it. the hardware gets retrofitted over the years but current banking infrastructure is based old mainframe architecture from like the 1950s i think

[11:42:53] <kittyblam> and all the highly centralized power grids, that could trivially get basic protection and house-level production via solar
[11:43:21] <kittyblam> and the centralized internet where you have to rely on ISPs and whatnot instead of being open for anyone with an antenna
[11:44:06] <kittyblam> the centralized infrastructure of the internet needs a serious push to be removed
[11:45:36] <kittyblam> by decentralizing the internet properly, and by using systems of mutual credit instead of "traditional" currencies, there would be much less danger to certain intellectual groups like this from getting wiped out in the offchance of a non-extinction level multi-continent scale disaster such as a world war or limited nuclear war

[23:35:52] <vatt> i am a total newbie to IRC in general, so i am not sure if people just talk in this main channel or have subchannels for different topics, and if so how to find those
[23:38:02] <Noisytoot> This channel is about the FSF. Other channels exist for other topics, you can use /list or /msg alis list to find them.
