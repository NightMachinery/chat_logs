[14:41:34] <T`aZ> so, bought a cheap second han crappy wheel. While waiting, i've installed The Elder Scrolls 1
[14:41:37] <T`aZ> Im loving it
[14:41:58] <T`aZ> and i died only 15times in one hour, so, it's ok
[14:43:25] <ERROH> you played elder scrolls with a wheel?
[14:45:57] <T`aZ> no; unrelated games :o
[14:49:22] <Carbonflux> you mean you installed Morrowwind?
[14:49:57] <Carbonflux> you could smoke in that game
[14:50:22] <Carbonflux> they removed smoking from all their games since
[14:50:35] <Carbonflux> tho there are some mods for smoking in fallout
[14:53:44] <pulse> You can smoke in Gothic
[14:58:05] <Carbonflux> that seems like a good game, i notice you can also urinate as well.
[14:58:13] <Carbonflux> fun!
[14:58:36] <Carbonflux> i will make a point to try it, thanks.
[15:06:08] <Renderwww> elder scrolls 1: carriage driver edition
[15:06:51] <Renderwww> probably plays like https://store.steampowered.com/app/844260/Rustler_Grand_Theft_Horse/
[15:10:51] <Carbonflux> heh
[15:12:23] <Carbonflux> that looks great
[15:12:32] <Carbonflux> live dev play as well
[15:12:50] <Carbonflux> seems like a really fun game
[15:13:01] <Renderwww> no clue if it's good, I wait until it's 2â‚¬ in a sale
[15:15:34] <Carbonflux> well, its anti-hero at least, thats a good start.
[15:15:38] <T`aZ> not, not morrowind
[15:15:41] <T`aZ> the arena
[15:16:14] <T`aZ> the first
[15:17:15] <Renderwww> "not, not morrowind the arena the first" is a strange name for a videogame
[15:55:57] <T`aZ> party pooper
[15:59:31] <Renderwww> that league of legends show on netflix is pretty good to my surprsie
[15:59:46] <Renderwww> really digging the art style
[16:01:19] <T`aZ> lol
[16:01:38] <T`aZ> (sorry, i had to)
[16:03:03] <Renderwww> it's usually abbreviated to lol
[16:06:30] <Carbonflux> ya its beautiful, i am trying to decide if i want to watch the first 3 or wait for them all to come so i can binge.
[16:07:22] <Carbonflux> the episodes are 45mins as well, longer than most animation.
[16:08:25] <Carbonflux> i have been also watching Starhunter redux on Amazon, they redid all the CG
[16:09:16] <Carbonflux> its a classic, transcendent themes and bounty hunting, firefly took a lot from it.
[16:09:46] <Carbonflux> anyway...
