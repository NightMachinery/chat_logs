[00:00:25] <sd> 08<G​ene> you answering >5 isn't automated
[00:00:29] <sd> 08<G​ene> that's a human response.
[00:00:54] <Hunterkll> nx032: you have 200 devices on the network, 50 of them aren't domain joined and will never accesss a windows server .... all parameters you will have to manually adjust for every single thing
[00:00:57] <nx032> its a i select 5 and it says you need 5 licenses, and 200 for each user, for remote 1 you need 10 licenses, etc
[00:01:26] <Hunterkll> simple math: are all your workstations AD joined? every user (or device, if that model makes sense) needs a server CAL
[00:01:31] <sd> 08<G​ene> are you talking about like a shopping cart on your VAR's website?
[00:01:42] <sd> 08<G​ene> where you can change the quantity of licenses you purchase?
[00:01:44] <Hunterkll> how many users access RDS systems for non-administrative purposes? You need that many CALs
[00:01:51] <Hunterkll> that's about it
[00:02:35] <shibboleth> Hunterkll, not if they're connecting to samba dcs and you keep winserv for maintenance and compliance

[00:04:02] <Hunterkll> @lol
[00:04:29] <shibboleth> Hunterkll, that's your opinion. and here's fact: with samba you can keep addata/"ntds" on zfs/lvm/btrfs/whatever. and now you have a time-machine
[00:04:41] <CptLuxx> haha
[00:04:41] <Hunterkll> ntds isn't the issue
[00:04:41] <EmetSelch> lol
[00:04:45] <Hunterkll> it's sysvol among many other things
[00:04:51] <Hunterkll> and the time-machine you *don't* want
[00:04:59] <Hunterkll> because rolling back to a previous AD version will break more than it'll fix
[00:05:04] <sd> 08<G​ene> eh
[00:05:09] <sd> 08<G​ene> oh right, samba
[00:05:12] <Hunterkll> machine trusts, external shit, etc
[00:05:23] <sd> 08<G​ene> i thought they fixed most rollback shit by checking change numbers and shit
[00:05:26] <Hunterkll> it's why you restore the latest version of a DC you have for minimal trouble, only one, then rebuild the rest in a DR scenario 
[00:05:28] <sd> 08<G​ene> since like 2016ish
[00:05:38] <Hunterkll> i'm not talking about USN rollbacks 
[00:06:07] <shibboleth> Hunterkll, works for us. windows-on-metal if essentially read-only anyway
[00:06:11] <Hunterkll> i'm talking about things like machine trust relationships (manually fixing each one that's aged out of scope) - things like us 
[00:06:25] <Hunterkll> shibboleth: sure, if you have a company/environment that can support it and expect to hire people who can, then go for it
[00:06:58] <Hunterkll> but if you're in a SMB environment, or a large corp environment, then you're a business risk and need to be removed

[00:08:14] <sd> 08<G​ene> it'll be a couple centuries
[00:08:26] <nullrend> they do have an infinity gauntlet
[00:08:40] <Hunterkll> that'll never happen as long as they make decent products
[00:10:40] <Hunterkll> they'd be even more decent if they could send out execution squads for clicktel admins 
[00:10:45] <shibboleth> Hunterkll, for shits and giggles we did a sim and hit ourselves with eternalblue/wannacry. took 239 seconds to drown it in a bucket (test)-fleet-wide
[00:11:34] <Hunterkll> shibboleth: if you had been patching properly, you wouldn't have been vulnerable when it was leaked 
[00:11:45] <shibboleth> as i said: we did it as a sim
[00:11:54] <Hunterkll> then again
[00:11:58] <Hunterkll> hence execution squad for clicktel admins

[00:12:19] <Hunterkll> all those major RDS exploits? Mitigated by a security setting that's TURNED ON BY DEFAULT SINCE WINDOWS VISTA/2008 
[00:12:29] <Hunterkll> you have to actively turn off NLA to be vulnerable to almost all RDS exploits 
[00:12:51] <Hunterkll> but clicktel admins do it!
[00:12:54] <Hunterkll> why? fuck if i know!
[00:13:10] <thegodsquirrel> I'm sure they had a good reason
[00:13:49] <thegodsquirrel> "I can't get this thing to work! What happens if I disable this....hey it works!"
[00:13:58] <Hunterkll> for large organizations that actually implement MFA on all their shit..... "RSA MFA solution requires NLA to be off to get to the login screen to access the login prompt to allow you to enter your RSA token information" WELL FIND A DIFFERENT FUCKING MFA PRODUCT YOU FUCKWITS
[00:14:55] <Hunterkll> A-KO actually scuppered a multi-million dollar RSA deal from our company many years ago using arguments like that
[00:15:08] <Hunterkll> like "uh, guys, we're substantially weakining our security here by deviating from how this shit is designed to work "
[00:15:22] <Hunterkll> just to fill the MFA checkbox
[00:15:22] <Hunterkll> lol

[00:16:45] <McDonaldsWiFi> I keep my NLA off
[00:16:48] <McDonaldsWiFi> cause I like a challenge
[00:16:50] <Hunterkll> RDP with NLA turned on functions the same

[00:17:09] <int0x1C8> so ka
[00:17:18] <Hunterkll> NLA makes you auth first before opening the RDP protocol/session/interfaces
[00:17:28] <Hunterkll> NLA off means you get full RDP session to the login screen on the server 
[00:17:45] <Hunterkll> hence, how NLA stops almost all major RDP exploits
[00:17:49] <sd> 08<G​ene> Aww yiss, expose NLA RDP directly to the internet
[00:17:56] <sd> 08<G​ene> erm, non-NLA*

[00:18:02] <Hunterkll> was gonna say
[00:18:08] <sd> 08<G​ene> can you actually record those sessions?
[00:18:11] <sd> 08<G​ene> that'd be fun
[00:18:13] <Hunterkll> NLA enabled RDP is the same risk profile as SSH - an exposed management interface
[00:18:17] <Hunterkll> yes, and there have been sites that did that
[00:18:18] <Hunterkll> lol
[00:18:22] <Hunterkll> just like the VNC stumbler sites
[00:18:26] <sd> 08<G​ene> i was thinking would be a fun honeypot
[00:18:56] <Hunterkll> but see - there are many MFA solutions that DO support NLA
[00:19:12] <Hunterkll> like Duo - you log in with user/password first, then you get the RDP session with a Duo prompt before you're actually signed in 
[00:19:21] <Hunterkll> *that* is acceptable as fuck 
[00:19:38] <fritzwastaken> Hunterkll: GET BACK TO WORK!

[02:41:47] <CableNinja> by that I mean dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb
[02:42:52] <sd> 06<d​Mupp3t> Should be able to clone it just fine as long as you aren't trying to do a live clone.
[02:43:28] <sd> 12<C​ardinal> clone to same size or bigger, you can clone the entire disk with clonezilla
[02:43:32] <sd> 12<C​ardinal> and it should be partitioned the same
[02:45:49] <kerat58> CableNinja:  I was thinking that; as that is what I would do in Linux.
[02:45:54] <sd> 06<d​Mupp3t> Yeah, free tools can do same size/bigger, some paid tools could do to a smaller size drive as long as it is large enough for the used space of course.
[02:46:19] <kerat58> I think the safest route here would be to DD to a drive directly; then boot; check evertything works; then "grow" the partitions with a LiveCD-type partition util perhaps
[02:46:24] <kerat58> Assuming new drive has more capacity that is
[02:47:13] <CableNinja> yep

[05:51:44] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> what the fuck is that thing
[05:51:51] <CableNinja> estranger, do they already have stuff for drawing? (good stuff)
[05:52:18] <CableNinja> you could sorta half use the moms thievery to double your gifts greatness by buying them some good drawing paper, pencils, etc
[05:53:00] <Activ8> Can you draw a good picture?
[05:53:42] <estranger> we got her castle art pencils last year
[05:53:54] <estranger> me draw? nope
[05:54:12] <estranger> I'm about on par with my 3 year old and coloring books
[05:54:59] <CableNinja> I can draw, but I need drugs to make me zone everything else out, or get in the drawing zone, idk, either way. I havent drawn since my drug days, havent been able to really
[05:55:31] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> does this girl have pets?
[05:56:40] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> maybe u could like find some artist to draw her some manga style thing of her cat or whatever if so

[06:01:43] <PattyCakes> estranger this place keeps showing up in my life - https://usa.kinokuniya.com/
[06:01:52] <estranger> click
[06:02:10] <PattyCakes> not only did they open one locally, anyone I know who reads say they are a good place to get jap stuff
[06:03:02] <Kiernian> I don't think you're supposed to say "jap" 
[06:03:38] <PattyCakes> I mean it wasn't in a derogatory way, it was just because I'm too high to time Japanese
[06:04:05] <Kiernian> fair enough 
[06:04:32] <PattyCakes> and in this specific case, Japanese manga series
[06:04:56] <Activ8> 👍 💋
[06:05:59] <estranger> man I'm lost lol
[06:06:26] <PattyCakes> estranger be the clutch godbro and get her an amazon gift card

[06:07:12] <PattyCakes> dude estranger, why not? you do realize the chances of you nailing the exact wants of a teenage girl
[06:07:16] <PattyCakes> are like 0%
[06:07:17] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> and boom, she has the whole series
[06:07:40] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> its better if it's one she doesnt want or know about tbh, then you introduce her to a new one
[06:07:54] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> its kinda win win unless you pick something weird as shit
[06:08:03] <PattyCakes> don't just give her a gift card, give her a giftcard with a note or something - you can make giftcards personal
[06:08:14] <PattyCakes> everyone is happy
[06:08:41] <PattyCakes> or do what society says you should do, and make everyone unhappy. That's the American way
[06:08:46] <estranger> cus I'm not giving a gift card, I'll risk it with a box

[12:19:55] <sd> 03<s​poo> DrZac: that's not really the issue--many smaller projects have had intentional vulnerabilities for the intention of having backdoor access to a project that uses it as a dependency. This unfortunately isn't uncommon. Thankfully code review is a thing and we can generally trust bigger projects despite not looking at the millions of lines ourselves because we don't have infinite times.
[12:21:47] <sd> 03<s​poo> IPC node is well-established and quite large with many large projects using it as a dependency. We trust the developers of such large dependencies to not maliciously create a backdoor as blatantly in an open source project because it WILL get caught and also because it would be damaging to the project's reputation
[12:25:31] <sd> 03<s​poo> It's not just sensationalism that caused it to blow up--this is a real issue that may have some effects in the open source ecosystem. Hopefully the change will be positive and will just increase code review and dependency version locking instead of discouraging the use of open source projects which will inevitably discourage development of more open source projects.

[17:07:15] <Hunterkll> Telgareith: there's no real argument, mixed metals cause potential corrosion if you mix the wrong kind of metals, but gold is only used in electronics as corrosion prevention due to it's reduced condictivity/increased resistance

[17:08:16] <cryptic1> are u sure?
[17:08:21] <mistiryWifi> the gold on the connector helps resist corrosion and that is all. as several of us have said several times.
[17:08:26] <Hunterkll> For any type of analogue signals, gold is a must because of line noise created by tin plated contacts

[17:31:31] <mistiryWifi> but never used them
[17:31:34] <Hunterkll> because the USB wouldn't work right

[17:45:04] <xe0n> winmxxxx
[17:45:10] <sintaxWifi> Hunterkll: that's cool
[17:45:12] <Oliber> eDonkey2000
[17:45:21] <DrGibbysWifi> Like, old school IRC botnets and shit
[17:45:28] <xe0n> ircspidddderrrrr
[17:45:31] <DrGibbysWifi> Join/part floods
[17:45:31] <sintaxWifi> the botnets are still around
[17:45:33] <bomb> Windows Media Player with green bald dude theme
[17:45:37] <sintaxWifi> heh
[17:45:41] <sintaxWifi> real player was where it's at
[17:45:46] <xe0n> .ra
[17:45:47] <xe0n> lol
[17:45:52] <xe0n> such a shit format!
[17:46:04] <bomb> Real Player was BAE
[17:46:07] <mistiryWifi> but was the best way to stream video from a site back then
[17:46:13] <mistiryWifi> unless you were fancy and had QT
[17:46:19] * sintaxWifi isn't fancy
[17:46:26] <Oliber> Real Player was great, but not for very long
[17:46:38] <bomb> porn industry demanded better quality
[17:46:47] <mistiryWifi> i wouldnt say it was ever great. it _worked_...but thats about it 
[17:46:48] <bomb> then Flash video happened
[17:47:08] <mistiryWifi> porn industry is why most of us have jobs these days
[17:47:15] <bomb> yeah
[17:47:24] <bomb> in both ways
[17:47:31] <mistiryWifi> porn industry pioneered tons of technologies that are prevalent in the IT world these days
[17:47:39] <Hunterkll> except VHS
[17:47:41] <Hunterkll> because sony was a cunt
[17:47:42] * DoTheNeedful throws punches
[17:47:42] <mistiryWifi> porn helped the format wars too
[17:47:46] <bomb> 1) they progressed the industry 2) some of us would be really dangerous towards other people at workplaces without porn
[17:47:50] <Hunterkll> VHS should have lost hands down
[17:47:59] <xe0n> dvd has lasted longer than vhs :P
[17:48:00] <mistiryWifi> Hunterkll: _was_? 
[17:48:06] <xe0n> and dvd is still more popular than bluray
[17:48:11] <mistiryWifi> is it?
[17:48:13] <xe0n> yup
[17:48:13] <mistiryWifi> interesteing
[17:48:18] <sintaxWifi> crazy
[17:48:22] <bomb> Hunterkll it was JVC saturated the market with VHS players. Beta didn't have a chance
[17:48:34] <fritzwastaken> ive never once owned a blu ray player
[17:48:42] <xe0n> well you're missing out :P
[17:48:44] <mistiryWifi> only ones i own are built into a console
[17:48:48] <xe0n> ^
[17:48:48] <mistiryWifi> i dont have a standalone unit
[17:48:55] <sintaxWifi> i think i owned a bluray player that came with a sound bar
[17:49:08] <bomb> what were your first MP3 players?
[17:49:19] <sintaxWifi> my pc
[17:49:19] <xe0n> creative something
[17:49:22] <xe0n> nomad or something?
[17:49:23] <mistiryWifi> some generic unnamed pos probably
[17:49:27] <sintaxWifi> i was 12 ripping cd's before mp3's were main stream lol
[17:49:35] <bomb> I owned a whopping 128MB Creative MuVo
[17:49:41] <sintaxWifi> i kind of want a zune
[17:49:44] <sintaxWifi> just to have one
[17:49:45] <Hunterkll> bomb: Beta had a great chance if sony wasn't so uptight about licensing and shit
[17:49:49] <Hunterkll> and refusing porn
[17:49:49] <xe0n> i had the cd player that supported mp3s :D
[17:49:51] <Hunterkll> porn drove VHS 
[17:49:52] <Oliber> bomb: sony's licencing cost for beta was a big issue
[17:49:58] <mistiryWifi> Hunterkll++
[17:50:02] <Oliber> and what Hunterkll said - content issues
[17:50:10] <xe0n> porn on laser disc, now that's sexy
[17:50:12] <mistiryWifi> licensing, and porn went VHS
[17:50:23] <mistiryWifi> porn went bluray instead of HD-DVD and look what won

[20:59:24] <McDonaldsWiFi> so... he's prolly right lol
[20:59:28] <Bru^> SW?
[20:59:31] <Bru^> good luck?
[20:59:35] <Bru^> what alternate universe is this!?
[20:59:40] <DomLS3> DrGibbysWifi: not often. Because I can do pretty much anything in sonicwall without needing support
[20:59:48] <DomLS3> only time i call them is for hardware issues
[20:59:58] <DrGibbysWifi> right, thats why I was curious 
[21:00:06] <Bru^> DomLS3: you have stockholm syndrome my friend
[21:00:08] <Bru^> xD
[21:00:21] <DomLS3> lol
[21:00:28] <McDonaldsWiFi> i will admit I have an easier time geting things changed in sonicwall
[21:00:31] <McDonaldsWiFi> vs cisco or something
[21:00:33] <DomLS3> You say that until you realize how fucked you can get with cisco
[21:00:35] <Bru^> <3 me some fortigate
[21:00:39] <DomLS3> it's so complex and confusing
[21:00:41] <Bru^> im not praising cisco AT ALL
[21:00:50] <McDonaldsWiFi> my fortigate 30e is still acting up
[21:00:51] <Bru^> I went from sonicwall-land at coke to Fortigates
[21:00:54] <DomLS3> you pretty much have to be a CCNA or have taken a class and use it regularly to be able to do shit in cisco
[21:00:55] <Bru^> McDonaldsWiFi: throw it out
[21:00:59] <McDonaldsWiFi> lol
[21:01:00] <Bru^> your IPS monitor is chewing up ALL THE CPU
[21:01:04] <Bru^> right?
[21:01:04] <McDonaldsWiFi> IPS is off
[21:01:08] <Bru^> ahh
[21:01:10] <Bru^> dont turn it on
[21:01:16] <McDonaldsWiFi> its a air gapped box for a handful of users
[21:01:17] <DomLS3> Bru^ that's fixed
[21:01:23] <DomLS3> new firmware fixed that issue years ago
[21:01:25] <McDonaldsWiFi> like a dozen users use it lol
[21:01:29] <Bru^> DomLS3: um
[21:01:29] <Bru^> no
[21:01:33] <Bru^> 6.2.10 is the latest
[21:01:35] <bomb> I carry a katana because I become more dangerous without it
[21:01:36] <Bru^> for that model
[21:01:40] <McDonaldsWiFi> fortigate did have a memory leak for a bit but that's fixed
[21:01:46] <Bru^> mem leak is fixed
[21:01:56] <McDonaldsWiFi> my WAN port on my just dies randomly
[21:02:01] <DomLS3> what model did he say he had for sonicwall?
[21:02:04] <McDonaldsWiFi> won't accept anything in or out until I cyclt the port on and off
[21:02:09] <DomLS3> my firmware is 6.5.4.7 on mine and even it's old
[21:02:10] <McDonaldsWiFi> me? 3700
[21:02:14] <DomLS3> but mine is an NSA 2400
[21:02:23] <DomLS3> no IPS issues
[21:02:26] <McDonaldsWiFi> i have the 2nd latest firmware now, the new one dropped this week I think?
[21:02:30] <Bru^> DomLS3: i was referring to the fortigate 30e
[21:02:33] <DomLS3> oooh
[21:02:34] <McDonaldsWiFi> i think Bru^ was talking about the forti
[21:02:36] <McDonaldsWiFi> yeah
[21:02:38] <DomLS3> I thought you were referring to sonicwall
[21:02:40] <Bru^> im dealing with some IPS monitor CPU pegging this week
[21:02:48] <DomLS3> Switch to sonicwall
[21:02:51] <DomLS3> wont have that problem :D
[21:02:52] <Bru^> haha
[21:02:57] <Bru^> its only that model and firmware so far
[21:03:01] <McDonaldsWiFi> i even moved from the dedicated WAN port on this 30e to a LAN and it still locks up
[21:03:02] <Bru^> think we just gonna downgrade
[21:03:08] <Bru^> its on an old fork
[21:03:17] <Bru^> McDonaldsWiFi: thats weird
[21:03:21] <McDonaldsWiFi> yeah
[21:03:26] <McDonaldsWiFi> support is scratching their heads lol
[21:03:30] <Bru^> try putting a dumbswitch in the middle
[21:03:32] <McDonaldsWiFi> no logs even mention it happening.. it just dies
[21:03:35] <Bru^> for troubleshooting
[21:03:50] <McDonaldsWiFi> for sniffin?
[21:04:17] <Bru^> whats the wan port plug into? ISP modem or something else?
[21:04:25] <McDonaldsWiFi> AT&T modem
[21:04:34] <McDonaldsWiFi> the weird thing is we have 1 circuit and 2 WANS
[21:04:38] <McDonaldsWiFi> the other WAN is rock steady
[21:04:40] <Bru^> ive seen weird things happen on some models and models
[21:04:40] <McDonaldsWiFi> on the sonicwall
[21:04:42] <DrGibbysWifi> ur a 2 wans
[21:04:45] <McDonaldsWiFi> :3
[21:04:59] <Bru^> try putting a wee dumb switch in between and see what happens
[21:05:13] <McDonaldsWiFi> what would that do if im not using it for snooping
[21:05:15] <McDonaldsWiFi> ?
[21:05:28] <euphoricallysane> McDonaldsWiFi, are you still on about the sonicwall that you haven't rooted yet?
[21:05:31] <Bru^> physical port change
[21:05:38] <Bru^> just try it
[21:05:45] <McDonaldsWiFi> euphoricallysane: oh that was last week ;P this is a real in -prod box lol
[21:05:46] <euphoricallysane> use the config file ffs
[21:05:53] <McDonaldsWiFi> Bru^: alright, but I already did that kind of?
[21:05:59] <McDonaldsWiFi> I moved the WAN to a LAN port xD
[21:06:06] <McDonaldsWiFi> it can't hurt though!
[21:06:08] <euphoricallysane> I mean, directly
[21:06:18] <McDonaldsWiFi> euphoricallysane: wait what
[21:06:22] <McDonaldsWiFi> euphoricallysane: what are you on about? :P
[21:06:31] <CptLuxx> [17:31:40] <McDonaldsWiFi> fortigate did have a memory leak for a bit but that's fixed
[21:06:33] <euphoricallysane> you wanted uberblocklist, yeh?
[21:06:33] <CptLuxx> hahahahhahahashahahhas
[21:06:40] <McDonaldsWiFi> CptLuxx: at least its not a problem for me lol
[21:06:47] <euphoricallysane> I was so wasted, I didn't type
[21:06:48] <McDonaldsWiFi> euphoricallysane: ohhh we're past that xDD
[21:06:52] <euphoricallysane> ok
[21:06:55] <CptLuxx> 7.0.5 its horrible again
[21:06:55] <Bru^> McDonaldsWiFi: different physical device entirely between
[21:06:56] <McDonaldsWiFi> love you though bro
[21:07:03] <McDonaldsWiFi> Bru^: gotcha
[21:07:03] <euphoricallysane> you, too
[21:07:14] <Bru^> had it happen a few times with lower end E and D models, with a particular ISPs equipment in the past
[21:07:23] <Bru^> putting that in between helped
[21:07:24] <McDonaldsWiFi> alright ill give that a shot... i still have to do a factory reset too before their support will move forward xD
[21:07:27] <Bru^> even as a bandaid

[21:26:02] <McDonaldsWiFi> Bru^: alright I stuck a switch inbetween there, we'll see if this helps! thanks for the tip man
[21:26:43] <NTSYSTEM> How can there be stevia 2.0
[21:26:53] <NTSYSTEM> it's literally a plant byproduct. 
[21:27:05] <euphoricallysane> The newest variant of stevia, due to processing and commodifying
[21:27:17] <euphoricallysane> it has been in the works with food scientists for years
[21:27:25] <euphoricallysane> less of that mint asshole flavor

[23:08:17] <signalblue> PublicWiFi: what question was it
[23:08:24] <signalblue> let's hear it
[23:08:47] <Hunterkll> lol fuck
[23:08:54] <Hunterkll> i'm in 7 mutual channels with PublicWiFi 
[23:09:08] <bomberman> which ones?
[23:09:22] <Hunterkll> #python is the most confusing, PublicWiFi doesn't know shit about programming
[23:09:22] <Hunterkll> :D
[23:09:47] <signalblue> Hunterkll: your whois doesn't list the channels
[23:09:59] <bomberman> you have no common chans then
[23:10:01] <signalblue> oh wait no it does
[23:10:07] <Hunterkll> yea it only lists ones you're in with the other person
[23:10:10] <signalblue> stupid mIRC
[23:10:14] <Hunterkll> for us that's just #linux and #reddit-sysadmin
[23:10:17] <signalblue> yes
[23:10:28] <signalblue> because I'm not connected to other channels
[23:10:29] <PublicWiFi> :P
[23:10:31] <signalblue> like #python
[23:10:35] <DrGibbysWifi> I'm only in 4 channels with maccas
[23:10:43] <Hunterkll> i have 5 with gibby
[23:10:46] <PublicWiFi> at least python is pseudocode
[23:10:53] <PublicWiFi> how come you never hang out in ##electronics Hunterkll ?
[23:10:57] <PublicWiFi> those guys there are chill
[23:11:02] <Hunterkll> because i don't often have problems i need help with?
[23:11:06] <Hunterkll> not very often anyway
[23:11:21] <PublicWiFi> signalblue: can't remember. ill usually ask something like... "Why can't Linux do X because Windows does it easy"
[23:11:28] <PublicWiFi> then youll et 100000 reasons Linux CAN do X lol
[23:11:35] <Hunterkll> that's the slashdot method
[23:11:45] <signalblue> oh that's the BEST way to get any linux help
[23:11:48] <PublicWiFi> ^
[23:12:01] <signalblue> windows is the best because it can do X, linux sucks
[23:12:03] <signalblue> lol

[23:22:33] <Hunterkll> lol
[23:22:52] <signalblue> seriously?
[23:23:01] <Hunterkll> yea around 2000 / 2001

[23:23:39] <Hunterkll> oh snap
[23:23:43] <Hunterkll> my new salary rate kicks in next week 
[23:23:50] <Hunterkll> nice
[23:24:19] <signalblue> IRC over 56.6K dial-up
[23:24:27] <signalblue> Hunterkll: join r/antiwork
[23:24:42] <Hunterkll> signalblue: why it's not like i do any work anyway
[23:24:43] <Hunterkll> lol
[23:24:54] <signalblue> true
[23:25:16] <signalblue> perhaps use the contact info in the WHOIS database for bash.org?
[23:25:45] <Hunterkll> pfff
[23:25:48] <Hunterkll> i'm too lazy to do all that
[23:25:49] <Hunterkll> you do it
[23:26:25] <signalblue> .org is maintained by the PIR and they stopped publishing WHOIS info for their TLD's
[23:26:33] <mistiryWifi> signalblue | IRC over 56.6K dial-up
[23:26:34] <signalblue> it's all redacted
[23:26:38] <mistiryWifi> i remember doing it on 14.4
[23:26:42] <signalblue> LOL
[23:26:58] <monr0e> signalblue: Piss easy to find historical WHOIS info though
[23:27:02] <mistiryWifi> then we got a 28.8 and couldnt believe the speeds
[23:27:04] <signalblue> I bet it wasn't any slower because IRC is low bandwith
[23:27:09] <signalblue> bandwidth*
[23:27:15] <mistiryWifi> 56k came out and WTF THIS IS AMAZING
[23:27:26] <signalblue> right around 1999/2000
[23:27:29] <mistiryWifi> it was not any slower, no
[23:27:54] <mistiryWifi> i mean, _technically_ yeah it would be. but not noticeable to the user.
[23:27:57] <monr0e> I went from 56k dialup to 8mb broadband. That was a jaw-dropping improvement
[23:27:57] <mistiryWifi> unless you were DCCing
[23:27:59] <signalblue> people complain about how slow dial-up was but websites were a lot smaller in those days as well
[23:28:00] <mistiryWifi> which...i did :D
[23:28:13] <signalblue> so like, was it really that slow?
[23:28:21] <mistiryWifi> yes
[23:28:25] <mistiryWifi> website is one thing
[23:28:26] <monr0e> It was in the early 2000s
[23:28:28] <mistiryWifi> try DLing a song
[23:28:30] <mistiryWifi> or a video
[23:28:35] <mistiryWifi> or even a higher res photo
[23:28:38] <signalblue> websites did not have as much nonsense as they do now
[23:28:49] <signalblue> all of that is true mistiry
[23:28:50] <monr0e> I remember trying to download a google video over dialup
[23:28:50] <mistiryWifi> photos would literally load top-down one line of pixels at a time
[23:29:05] <signalblue> photos were of a lot lower resolution, no?
[23:29:14] <Hunterkll> fuck i downloaded the WoW beta over dialup
[23:29:14] <Hunterkll> lol
[23:29:20] <mistiryWifi> lol nice
[23:29:28] <signalblue> how many weeks did that take?
[23:29:33] <Arlion> I remember downloading boobies that were black and white and would draw one pixel at a time. talk about an edge god dam
[23:29:39] <mistiryWifi> yeah
[23:29:52] <signalblue> not 4K though
[23:29:54] <DrGibbysWifi> what the fuck have I returned to?
[23:30:02] <mistiryWifi> 5 seconds to DL a 1MB photo on a 28.8
[23:30:06] <signalblue> what good is porn if it's not 4K
[23:30:10] <mistiryWifi> and its not like you actually _got_ 28.8 
[23:30:17] <vinrock> ew 4k porn
[23:30:20] <vinrock> i dont wanna see pussy bumps
[23:30:22] <DrGibbysWifi> I only view the highest quality 8k porn
[23:30:24] <signalblue> no you got a lot less than 28.8
[23:30:26] <mistiryWifi> iirc my 56k modem usually got around 30-32
[23:30:32] <signalblue> latency and all
[23:30:33] <mistiryWifi> dont rmeember what the 28.8 connected at
[23:30:50] <mistiryWifi> or actually got, i should say
[23:31:03] <mistiryWifi> modem dialing sounds were glorious tho

[23:31:38] <mistiryWifi> DrGibbysWifi: lmao
[23:31:39] <Kiernian> on a 56k modem I was getting like...3 - 4, max 6 down.
[23:31:44] <signalblue> monr0e: bash.org has always had whois privacy, so there's no way to get contact info through that
[23:31:50] <signalblue> Kiernan: megs?
[23:31:59] <Kiernian> lolno
[23:32:02] <mistiryWifi> yes megs on a modem with 'k'
[23:32:13] <signalblue> '/s'
[23:32:19] <mistiryWifi> :P
[23:32:33] <signalblue> how does a phone line communicate with the IP network?
[23:32:51] <Kiernian> I remember it took me like, 18 hours to download all 34megs of dreamweaver 3
[23:32:53] <signalblue> how do you go from dialing a phone number to getting IP access
[23:32:55] <signalblue> >
[23:32:56] <vinrock> i think the first modem i had at home was a hayes 2400 baud
[23:33:00] <vinrock> the handshake would take like 5 minutes
[23:33:22] <Kiernian> or was it 334 megs, I forget. that was a long ass time ago
[23:33:32] <mistiryWifi> i worked with a guy that worked with Hayes
[23:33:44] <mistiryWifi> old school hardware engineer
[23:33:47] <mistiryWifi> did all our board designs
[23:33:52] <vinrock> we had nothing but hayes modems all the way until 3com
[23:34:00] <signalblue> grey beard
[23:34:05] <mistiryWifi> signalblue: easy
[23:34:14] <Kiernian> yeah, hayes, 3com, then us robotics
[23:34:20] <vinrock> yep
[23:34:23] <signalblue> go on mistiry
[23:34:28] <mistiryWifi> modem on the ISP side answers the call. DHCP or other mechanism to assign IP space to the device.
[23:34:36] <vinrock> had a zyxel modem when we got the isdn line
[23:34:39] <mistiryWifi> i was technically a dial up ISP at a former job
[23:34:47] <mistiryWifi> had a T1 come into 24 lines
[23:34:53] <signalblue> mistiry: yes and then the ISP modem does what?
[23:35:01] <vinrock> dude remember early internet days when there were just boatloads of tiny isp's
[23:35:02] <mistiryWifi> talks to the other modem?
[23:35:04] <PublicWiFi> it works teh same as cable modem or other modems
[23:35:17] <PublicWiFi> just different communication protocol to establish the connection
[23:35:22] <signalblue> so the ISP modem dials out?
[23:35:39] <signalblue> vinrock: they all just bought internet from other larger ISPs
[23:35:52] <signalblue> they fizzled out when the big guys dominated the market share
[23:35:52] <mistiryWifi> no the ISP modem answers the call from the other modem
[23:35:53] <vinrock> yeah but the big ones didnt serve residential customers
[23:36:02] <signalblue> yeah
[23:36:24] <Hunterkll> <Dr_DOS> i'd go straight into the army if they allowed IRC on weekends.
[23:36:26] <PublicWiFi> then once the call is established they both send modulated sound data to each other 
[23:36:33] <signalblue> mistiry: how does the ISP modem reach the Internet, is what I'm asking
[23:36:50] <Hunterkll> signalblue: leased lines, T1s, etc
[23:36:54] <Hunterkll> to larger backbone providers 
[23:36:55] <signalblue> https://i.imgur.com/sPXvd2l.png
[23:37:01] <PublicWiFi> the same as any other ISp at that point
[23:37:10] <Hunterkll> signalblue: a local dialup provider might have a T1 to an upstream backbone provider / telco 
[23:37:19] <mistiryWifi> tthe ISP has a connection to an upsteam provider
[23:37:21] <signalblue> Hunterkll: so the ISP would communicate over TI to backdbone?
[23:37:27] <Hunterkll> or wahtever else they had
[23:37:30] <signalblue> and then relay that back across the modem>
[23:37:32] <Hunterkll> ATM / frame relay leased line, wahtever
[23:37:33] <PublicWiFi> yup
[23:37:34] <signalblue> ?
[23:37:37] <signalblue> ah ok
[23:37:40] <Hunterkll> signalblue: it works just like it works today
[23:37:42] <Hunterkll> no different
[23:37:48] <Hunterkll> modem -> isp -> whatever the ISP is hooked up to
[23:37:54] <PublicWiFi> the dial up is jsut a way to talk to the server, after that nothing is different
[23:37:59] <mistiryWifi> ^
[23:38:03] <signalblue> bring T1 to the premise... more effecient
[23:38:12] <DrGibbysWifi> whut
[23:38:13] <Hunterkll> signalblue: replace your fiber/cable terminal with a dialup modem, and it's still the exact same model
[23:38:25] <Hunterkll> nothing changes except the end user access tech
[23:38:40] <DrGibbysWifi> and speed :P
[23:38:57] <signalblue> Hunterkll: the "whatever the ISP is hooked up to" can be dial-up once again, right?
[23:39:13] <Hunterkll> that'd be pretty goddamn stupid
[23:39:20] <signalblue> yes it would
[23:39:35] <Riviera> was common enough with BBS
[23:39:39] <PublicWiFi> ^
[23:39:42] <Hunterkll> yes, but we're talking about an ISP
[23:39:46] <Hunterkll> not a destination 
[23:39:50] <Hunterkll> an ISP providing internet access
[23:39:53] <Riviera> yeah,
[23:39:55] <signalblue> yeah where you leave your message on a BBS and bounce
[23:40:00] <Riviera> some BBS provided internet access is what i mean.

[23:40:53] <PublicWiFi> if you wanted you could do this lol
[23:41:02] <DOMF> Back in the late 80s our library provided a BBS that you could get out to what internet existed back then (gopher lol)
[23:41:12] <PublicWiFi> install a modem in your home server and dial in, bridge that to your cable internet
[23:41:13] <PublicWiFi> xD
[23:41:37] <Hunterkll> that... would be precisely how an ISP functions normally....
[23:41:46] <Riviera> what bandwidths are possible today anyway, over all these crippled voip codecs

[23:42:27] <Hunterkll> but it was a shitty home landline kit from AT&T
