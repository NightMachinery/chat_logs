[08:12:14] <causative> we ought to have car-associated shopping carts, so that you use your cart to shop, then in some way get it inside the cargo space of the car, then drive home, then roll it right inside.. with some way of negotiating steps
[08:15:29] <causative> I guess to achieve that it would have to be in some way robotic, unless the house is designed with ramps or cables to get it over the steps

[09:28:51] <pussipupu> Sure but there's no point taking your house robot to the shop, just take the container
[09:31:48] <causative> you would need to push the container into the shop - it has to have wheels both at home and at the shop
[09:32:04] *** Quits: qu4nt1n (~qu4nt1n@78.198.214.34) (Quit: KVIrc 5.0.0 Aria http://www.kvirc.net/)
[09:32:04] <causative> otherwise there would be an unnecessary extra step of transferring from the store's cart to the container
[09:32:47] <causative> so if it already needs wheels, why go to the trouble of making you attach/detach them, the point is to save labor
[09:33:11] <pussipupu> Load it like cargo containers are loaded, with forks at both ends
[09:33:37] <pussipupu> Which also has the advantage you get the shop side convenience whether you bother with a house robot at all
[09:34:06] <pussipupu> And shops being already built around trollies, a stair climbing robot is just going to be inefficient
[09:34:32] <causative> the purpose is more to save you from carrying groceries into your house in your arms instead of in a cart
[09:35:10] <mnemon> causative: shopping carts and bags/boxes seem to already accomplish this fairly well?
[09:35:27] <causative> into your house?
[09:35:35] <pussipupu> For less able bodied people there's definitely a good use case
[09:35:58] <causative> well, it's just more convenient, not necessarily about disabled people
[09:36:14] <mnemon> seems like a lot of work for little to negative gain
[09:36:16] <causative> you use a cart at the shop, why not keep using it at home?  why be so inefficient, making multiple trips to and from your car?
[09:36:22] <pussipupu> For myself shopping bags and crates work well, and I suspect a robot capable of navigating from my driveway to my kitchen would be many thousands of euros
[09:36:54] <mnemon> people are getting too little exercice as is and if you're fit then carrying the bags from car to home is a nonissue
[09:37:13] <pussipupu> I like the idea of containerised shopping trolleys though
[09:37:31] <causative> I think all you'd need for that pussipupu is like a two wheeled hand truck that has a motor and big squishy wheels for the stairs
[09:37:56] <pussipupu> especially if I could get a bike trailer that's compatible with them, very convenient cargo bike solution
[09:38:07] <causative> then you could easily haul 100 lbs of groceries up the stairs with little effort
[09:40:24] <causative> it doesn't have to be a robot, you pull it behind yourself like any hand truck, it just also has a motor to assist
[09:40:39] <pussipupu> you can do that easily if the containers are fork compatible and the loaders stay on site
[09:40:50] <causative> you want a home forklift?
[09:41:04] <pussipupu> which is how containerised and palletised transport works in commercial logistics
[09:41:12] <causative> forklifts don't go up stairs
[09:41:13] <pussipupu> I want a home pallet truck
[09:42:05] <mnemon> not sure what that would bring wrt groceries?
[09:42:06] <pussipupu> I mean, personally I don't need motorised assistance for groceries, especially given it would cost a lot
[09:42:29] <causative> idk I think big squishy wheels + a motor would not be too expensive to make
[09:43:03] <causative> assuming it would actually work for stairs
[09:43:26] <mnemon> causative: need a bit more for any mass market application, as hacking something simple like that seems like a recipe for dead/severly injured people
[09:44:08] <causative> what's the potential for injury, if used properly? you'd pull it up the stairs behind you, so it can't fall on you
[09:44:20] <causative> the wheels can turn quite slowly
[09:44:26] <mnemon> it can dislodge 100lbs of groceries on someone else
[09:44:45] <mnemon> or roll/tumble over someone else
[09:45:28] <causative> yeah, you can do that also if you're trying to stagger up the stairs with 100lbs of groceries
[09:45:32] <mnemon> if they turn very slowly it's just too slow to be useful
[09:45:33] <causative> without any device
[09:46:00] <mnemon> the difference is that you have self preservation instinct and agency, simple device like that does not
[09:46:35] <mnemon> once you let go it will crush anyone unlucky to meet it without any qualms :3
[09:46:43] <causative> people sell motorized lawn care equipment
[09:46:56] <causative> is a groceries stair climber more dangerous than a chainsaw?
[09:47:17] <causative> or than a riding lawnmower?
[09:47:19] <mnemon> probably
[09:47:30] <mnemon> not because of inherent qualities but rather the operating environment

[09:48:15] <causative> lumberjack is the most deadly job in America

[09:49:08] <mnemon> exacting their revenge by falling on you :3
[09:49:21] <causative> well, that's the same danger anyone takes on when they use a chainsaw in their back yard
[09:50:00] <causative> and most home chainsaw users don't have the chainsaw pants or the training
[09:51:23] <causative> the only case where you'd be using it on stairs would be in your own home, not in a crowded apartment building, because crowded apartment buildings have elevators
[09:52:21] <causative> so the risk of dropping a jug of milk on a stranger is low
[09:52:46] <causative> hardly any groceries would really be very likely to injure anyone if they fell off
[09:56:13] <causative> so the cart would have 6 wheels:  4 normal shopping cart wheels, and 2 big squishy powered wheels that are normally disengaged, used for stair climbing
[09:56:42] <mnemon> I assumed apartment buildings without elevators, rarely need to climb a lot of stairs in your own house
[09:57:12] <causative> I don't think there are any apartment buildings without elevators in the US? very rare use case if so
[09:57:26] <causative> the point is not about climbing a *lot* of stairs
[09:57:37] <causative> it's about getting a whole cart up the 3 steps at your front door
[09:57:46] <mnemon> just build a ramp if it's your own house
[09:58:18] <causative> that doesn't look nice
[09:59:05] <causative> it's not for someone with a disability, it's to be able to take one shopping cart, fill it at the shop, *not* unpack it into your car but just take the whole cart back, and push the cart right into your house and up to your fridge
[09:59:52] <causative> just saves time and effort

[10:20:34] <causative> ground-based wheeled delivery drones could be the future
[10:21:54] <causative> but they wouldn't be suited for distributing groceries to suburban neighborhoods, because of the distances involved

[10:26:17] <causative> plane flies overhead, drops 100 packages with parachutes, parachutes have control systems on board to steer them to each target location
[10:26:26] <causative> problem would be returning the parachute systems
[10:26:33] <causative> guess it wouldn't work because of that
[10:26:59] <causative> balloons though
[10:27:32] <causative> nah, probably they would be too unreliable due to wind
[10:27:40] <amigojapan> Flying drones were stupid to begin with, seems they only worked for people with lawns
[10:28:30] <causative> that sounds like a solvable technical problem
[10:28:35] <causative> just need more accurate control systems
[10:28:47] <causative> so that the drone can go to a particular window
[10:30:06] <amigojapan> And what, we need to add a platform to our windows?
[10:30:38] <causative> maybe, or just open it and reach out to take the item
[10:31:12] <amigojapan> Ok then we need to be there when the done arrives
[10:31:34] <amigojapan> Also windy days would affect flying drones too
[10:31:49] <causative> not really if it's a good sized drone
[10:32:14] <amigojapan> Floor drones are more realistic I think
[10:32:16] <causative> well, I mean, it does affect the drone but the drone will still be able to keep course as long as its top speed is above the wind speed
[10:33:19] <amigojapan> Just use the Boston dynamics big dog robot
[10:33:36] <causative> that's too expensive, a wheeled robot is sufficient
[10:34:31] <amigojapan> It's less expensive than paying a delivery guy
[10:35:05] <causative> questionable
[10:35:17] <amigojapan> And they can probably go up steps
[10:35:41] *** Joins: cynicalcats_ (~cynicalca@c-24-8-58-78.hsd1.co.comcast.net)
[10:37:01] <causative> yes... but it's my understanding that spot is not perfectly reliable at going up steps
[10:37:02] *** Quits: cynicalcats (~cynicalca@user/cynicalcats) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[10:37:09] <causative> spot also doesn't look like it can carry very much
[10:37:19] <causative> and it costs $74500
[10:37:22] <amigojapan> Yup
[10:37:43] <causative> a delivery bot would have to leave deliveries below any steps
[10:38:09] <amigojapan> causative: that's like the salary of two years of Amazon employee pay
[10:38:23] <causative> yeah but it doesn't count maintenance
[10:38:30] <amigojapan> Ok
[10:38:40] <causative> and a human employee is more capable than spot
[10:38:51] <amigojapan> Right

[10:40:37] <causative> for what residential type? in a suburban nbhd a truck is going to be more efficient than an army of spots walking between houses and the distribution center
[10:40:55] *** Quits: aleph0 (~aleph0@gateway/tor-sasl/aleph0) (Quit: aleph0)
[10:41:03] <causative> an urban nbhd is more challenging for a robot
[10:41:37] <causative> and theft/vandalism would be a constant problem
[10:42:34] <causative> that's why I think we might see a hybrid of a human driving a truck to the general area, and wheeled robots delivering the last half-mile
[10:42:58] <causative> that way there is at least a human *in* the area to monitor the drones and fix them if they get stuck
[10:44:19] <amigojapan> causative: it could work with a self driving truck taking spot to the place
[10:44:33] <causative> eventually it could
[10:44:39] <causative> right now, no
[10:44:54] <causative> you also need someone to load packages from the truck into the drones, which is possible but expensive for robots
[10:45:06] <causative> the driver can stop and do that
[10:46:22] <causative> also with a self driving truck you *don't* have a human in the area to help the robots when they get stuck
[10:46:40] <amigojapan> Ok that's true

[12:22:48] <sdfgsdfg> different terrain different circumstances events etc, itll only succeed with a neural network
[12:23:02] <sdfgsdfg> amazon's trialing their drones in australia and their drones are getting attacked by birds so far
[12:26:18] <sdfgsdfg> so the maintenance might make it unprofitable when you notice half your drones are getting bitchslapped by birds, getting thrown around town, people losing their packages to angry magpies

[12:52:22] <pussipupu> It always throws be that Australian magpies aren't corvids, just a different clever black and white bird
[12:54:56] <Atque> pussipupu: Australian magpies really dislike cyclists. Like they pretty much want them all dead sadly. Not sure if other magpies do this globally?
[12:55:26] <pussipupu> Nah the original magpies are pretty chill
[12:55:55] <pussipupu> They're in the same family as crows and can be befriended too
[12:56:30] <Atque> Yeah, in Australia, only the type in Tasmania are relaxed toward strangers in spring. The ones in Sydney and Melbourne and all that pretty much want to kill anything unfamiliar near the tree with its nest.

[12:57:02] <pussipupu> The only problem I have with corvids as a cyclist is hooded crows don't want to get out of the way
[12:57:20] <pussipupu> I know they've got good reflexes, but it makes me feel like I'm going to hurt them
[12:59:01] <pussipupu> The only thing close to a bird attack I've had in Finland was some thrushes dive-bombing me when I was playing ukulele in the garden

[13:23:02] <blkshp> :D
[13:23:43] <mnemon> pussipupu: go boating near uninhabited isles around the nesting season and you'll get swarmed :o
[13:25:42] <trinity> amazingly i had magpies near my house this season and they didn't swoop just came up beside me, then yesterday and earlier today there was an adult and baby and it was feeding the baby and they didn't seem to mind me being there at all
[13:26:32] <trinity> even when the adult went to get food and the baby was in the tree and i was between the parent and the little one didn't mind me at all but maybe they just swoop when eggs are in the nest
[13:27:01] <trinity> they are scary birds though they just keep going after someone sometimes
[13:27:46] <mnemon> they do usually swoop as long as the chicks are small enough but the ones nesting in urban areas are usually used to people
[13:28:03] <mnemon> so don't treat 'em as threat by default
[13:28:30] <mnemon> unless you start making weird noises I guess :)
[13:29:04] <pussipupu> mnemon: ok, buy me a boat
[13:29:49] <trinity> i think they actually recognize people
[13:30:07] <trinity> who they recognize or who is a stranger
[13:30:12] <trinity> i think birds are smarter than people think
[13:30:27] <trinity> magpies anyway
[13:30:29] <trinity> and crows
[13:31:06] <trinity> and parrots too
[13:33:13] <mnemon> pussipupu: rowboats are pretty easily accessible & cheap if you really want to buy one
[13:33:48] <mnemon> like <2k€ new
[13:33:56] <pussipupu> Buy me a small Bermuda rigged sloop
[13:34:05] <pussipupu> Sorry I should have been clear
