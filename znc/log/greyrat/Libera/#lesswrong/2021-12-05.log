[00:01:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> What's the tl;dw on that? Where *is* the antimatter??
[00:02:51] <spxtr> Basically, the current laws of physics do not predict anything about the ratio of matter and antimatter. That's a boundary condition.
[00:03:29] <feep> "boundary" is just a way to say "law of physics" in a way that makes it sound less important
[00:03:39] <spxtr> Many HEP people *assume* the ratio must have been 1, and then they make all sorts of theories about how the laws of physics can be modified to get to what we see now.
[00:04:18] <spxtr> All laws of physics are differential equations. They describe how matter works but now how much of it there should be to start with.
[00:04:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok, regexp question

[01:13:01] <dv^_^> how so?

[01:23:26] <Khoth> eh it's not like 100% true but I think it's close enough for a meme
[01:23:37] <feep> I think it isn't
[01:23:41] <feep> in a dangerous way

[01:25:30] <feep> I guess it depends on if they already have a sense of simplicity

[01:30:05] <feep> (and I'm not just saying that cause I'm firmly in the like, right-middle at the company I work XD)
[01:30:48] <feep> but fundamentally, for loops prompt a kind of semilocal mutagenic code that is toxic to read
[01:30:54] <feep> and unmaintainable
[01:31:06] <spxtr> hard disagree
[01:31:20] <feep> because you end up throwing in these huge basically state machines that change direction every pass
[01:31:43] <feep> and variables barely mean what they say if at all
[01:32:09] <feep> and you have to pass through some sort of functional style to get better primitives in your head
[01:32:14] <feep> so you can then write sane loops
[01:35:20] <spxtr> one of my favorite features of golang is that it encourages dumb code made out of ifs and for loops.

[01:36:22] <spxtr> I think we have very different opinions about coding

[01:40:32] <feep> sure but go to me is like equilibrium type shit

[02:44:51] <gwern> (supply chain woes: literally not one single can of friskies wet cat food at walmart. none of the 30-can packs in 4 sets of varieties, not a single can of the 20 or so individual varieties generally with 20+ cans each. just 5 completely empty shelves, lacking even the cardboard trays)
[02:46:29] <gwern> (and almost all cat treats of any kind also gone. pretty impressive inasmuch as the rest of walmart was pretty stuffed)
[02:47:56] <Betawolf> I dunno what you want to do with double-spaces, but the behaviour I see for " foo bar " is ["", "foo", "bar", ""], which looks like exactly what you asked for.
[02:49:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> Betawolf: Not in the implementations I am concerned with, it seems
[02:50:09] <Betawolf> ah, sadly I can't speak for different regex dialects
[02:50:19] <saturn2> Obormot\Arcturus: can you write down what it should do in all possible cases?
[02:52:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: If string begins with whitespace, first match should be empty string. Then after that (if any), matches should be contiguous runs of non-whitespace. Finally, if string ends with whitespace, last match should be empty string.
[02:52:30] <Betawolf> Yeah, that's what mine seems to do... in Python 3. 
[02:52:55] <Betawolf> Translation is left as an exercise.
[02:53:46] <Betawolf> What implementation are you working in, anyway?
[02:55:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> Actually nm it does work in this one

[02:57:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Ironically I had to turn *off* the "use Unicode word boundaries" flag to get it working with yours)
[02:58:05] <Betawolf> I do find the word boundary stuff a bit magical. \B$ seems like it shouldn't do that.
[03:00:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> For one thing, "word characters" are themselves kinda magical
[03:00:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> "\w  Match a word character. Word characters are [\p{Ll}\p{Lu}\p{Lt}\p{Lo}\p{Nd}]." ... like ... what
[03:02:43] <Betawolf> very "you think you know what words are, puny mortal?"
[03:02:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> Which apparently means: "a lowercase letter that has an uppercase variant" OR "an uppercase letter that has a lowercase variant" OR "a letter that appears at the start of a word when only the first letter of the word is capitalized" OR "a letter or ideograph that does not have lowercase and uppercase variants" OR "a digit zero through nine in any script except ideographic scripts"
[03:02:59] <feep> alright, just hit 63wpm
[03:03:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> (But NOT, say, "a special character that is used like a letter")
[03:03:13] <feep> slowly getting back up there. I still mix up delete and space and return tho XD
[03:03:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Or "any mathematical symbol")
[03:03:40] <feep> and I am still not convinced of some choices on this keyboard like the vertical row offsets
[03:04:03] <feep> like I get the logic but how am I supposed to type, say, ce quickly if I can only use one finger
[03:04:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> Betawolf: Which means that it breaks on e.g. "foo bar +"

[03:04:32] <saturn2> Obormot\Arcturus: /^\S*|(?<=\s)$|\S+/ maybe this would be simpler
[03:04:39] <Betawolf> what's expected behaviour there?
[03:04:45] <feep> I feel like this keyboard asks me to staccato some combos in a way that fundamentally limits the high tier speeds it can achieve without cheating and moving fingers off-column
[03:05:07] <Betawolf> Oh, '+' and not '+' ''
[03:05:09] <feep> which then makes the entire point of the lowered columns look absurd.
[03:05:37] <feep> cd is actually a great example
[03:06:00] <feep> because on a regular keyboard with what I'll call triangular layouto, I can roll that off with two fingers
[03:06:02] <feep> cd
[03:06:03] <Betawolf> I think saturn2's does that
[03:06:12] <feep> that's pointing digit, then middle digit
[03:06:33] <feep> with the advantage I feel I can only hit it with middle finger both times. like I'm "supposed" to
[03:07:07] <feep> I mean, I guess the point is halfway to limit the angle of attack, that's what gives it that nice wrist-at-restness
[03:07:14] <saturn2> (what should happen if the whole string is whitespace?)
[03:07:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Promising...

[03:08:17] *** Quits: galambo (~galambo@user/galambo) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[03:08:21] <feep> I think part of the issue is that my entire system of typing relies on that triangular layout.
[03:08:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: If the whole string is whitespace then the matches should be a pair of empty strings (but I am willing to tolerate deviations on this point if need be...)
[03:08:43] <feep> I'm not sure if it has a name. angular typing? maybe I should write a book.
[03:08:51] <Betawolf> looks like it does that already
[03:08:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ditto for empty strings, I'm ok with special-casing that
[03:08:56] <saturn2> yeah
[03:09:12] <shawwwn> This is nuts. I’m using Jump Connect from my iPad to program on my laptop, sitting at home, while in a moving car on my way to the mall.

[03:10:02] <saturn2> Betawolf: negative lookbehind
[03:10:10] <Betawolf> ah, handy
[03:10:16] <saturn2> no sorry, positive lookbehind
[03:10:26] <feep> "lookbehind is good actually"
[03:10:35] <saturn2> it is good
[03:10:46] <saturn2> when you need it
[03:10:52] <saturn2> when you don't need it, it is bad
[03:10:53] <shawwwn> Negative lookbehind is more useful
[03:11:11] <shawwwn> Positive lookbehind can be accomplished by a regular regex with a capturing group
[03:11:20] <shawwwn> Negative lookbehind can’t
[03:11:31] <shawwwn> At least not for more than one character
[03:11:44] <shawwwn> Well, a literal match to be more precise
[03:11:51] <feep> the nice thing about slanted, or I guess eight-finger typing, is that I feel it's easier to learn to be fast with it than ten-finger typing

[07:38:38] <quanticle> So wait, did you get your cat back?
[07:38:51] <shawwwn> She took off his gps collar. I doubt she knew what it was.

[07:38:58] <quanticle> Oh
[07:39:32] <gwern> only a spy kitty would be wearing _Get Smart_ level spy gear, of course, and how could such a good little kitty be a *spy* kitty
[07:39:35] <shawwwn> It wasn’t easy to find him. We were getting more and more hysterical, then checked the last known gps location one more time a few days later
[07:40:05] <shawwwn> Luckily she let him be near the outside by letting him be on her sunporch, with a screen door
[07:40:17] <shawwwn> So when we called his name, he meowed back and we heard each other
[07:40:40] <shawwwn> And luckily for her, her door was unlocked, otherwise I would have torn open that sunscreen
[07:40:56] <quanticle> You're lucky you weren't busted for breaking and entering
[07:41:30] <shawwwn> I considered calling the cops, but that raised the risk significantly that I wouldn’t get him back
[07:41:33] <quanticle> Or misdemeanor trespass, at the very least
[07:42:00] <shawwwn> It would be my word against hers. I do have photos, but it would still be a long, drawn out process in the courts
[07:42:18] <quanticle> Did you get the collar back too
[07:42:25] <shawwwn> Walking up and opening the door for your lost family member wasn’t a hard decision
[07:42:50] <shawwwn> Nah, but I would have given a thousand dollars to get him back. I didn’t mind.
[07:42:56] <shawwwn> Collars
[07:42:56] <quanticle> The fact that you refer to that cat as if it were a person solidifies in my mind the idea that all pet owners are fundamentally insane

[07:44:17] <quanticle> enterprisey: The person who took the cat probably didn't think of it as stealing. They probably thought of it as giving a stray cat a new home. Even though the cat wasn't a stray.
[07:44:26] <enterprisey> yeah I worded that too strongly
[07:44:38] <shawwwn> It’s alright. You probably aren’t wrong.
[07:44:38] <quanticle> No, you worded it just right.
[07:44:51] <shawwwn> Wait

[07:54:18] <quanticle> I guess all I'm saying is that you're somewhat lucky that you're not facing felony charges, given that what you did is a pretty clear-cut case of breaking and entering.
[07:54:48] <quanticle> "But it was my pet" So what? That doesn't give you the right to enter someone else's home
[07:54:51] <gwern> (it'd be like if someone had picked up your phone along the road. that's not theft, it's just property you lost/abandoned. they don't know where it goes to. if you inform them it's your phone and then they refuse to give it back, at *that* instant, it becomes theft: they are taking something that belongs to you, instead of merely holding it for the rightful owner)
[07:55:30] <shawwwn> My cat was chipped, collared, and had a gps attachment. That argument wouldn’t fly, any more than “oh I found this phone on the street” would fly
[07:55:44] <shawwwn> “Mine now. Not stealing. Their fault they left it.”
[07:55:52] <quanticle> And similarly, if Apple's Find My Phone or whatever, led you to their house, and you saw your phone on their porch, you would not have the right to enter their property in order to retrieve it
[07:56:18] <gwern> chips are invisible, collars don't tell you who the owner is (unless you had your name/address on it? I don't think you mentioned that), and a GPS attachment you said she wouldn't know what it was
[07:56:41] <shawwwn> Of course we did. Name and phone number
[07:56:51] <shawwwn> He’s an indoor outdoor cat
[07:57:33] <gwern> (anyway, I think the payment for bailment is a pretty reasonable feature of the law. compensation for expenses for doing something you would have wanted done - you do want your pet fed, and if it takes months or it's like, a horse or a tiger, that could be a substantial amount of money)
[07:58:16] <gwern> I don't think there's any of course about it. none of my family's cats hae ever had collars with names and phone numbers. but you didn't mention that before
[07:58:28] <shawwwn> I’m amused that in the same situation, both of you would apparently choose to go through the courts while the psycho that had your pet could do whatever she wanted with them
[07:58:41] <gwern> if the collar was clearly labeled, then I think she clearly breached the part about reasonable efforts to return it to its true ower
[07:58:48] <shawwwn> “Oops, lost him.” Nope, in reality her friend now has him and I never see him again
[07:59:10] <shawwwn> Yes, his gps collar had our name and phone on it
[07:59:25] <gwern> what do you mean by 'on it'? written, not stored in RAM or something like that I hope
[07:59:31] <shawwwn> Yes
[08:00:04] <gwern> and anyway, I never said that I wouldn't do the same thing. I'd have to see the situation for myself to decide if I just quickly opened the door or if I knocked to 'thank her'
[08:00:07] <shawwwn> We found him with no collar, and neutered. She knew what she was doing.
[08:00:27] <gwern> ...'and neutered'? my god
[08:00:37] <gwern> what goes on in that kitchen
[08:01:10] <shawwwn> Say what you want, but you may have minded if you were the one who some strange aliens agreed should be neutered
[08:01:11] <quanticle> shawwwn: Yeah, because we both know that committing a felony is not worth it for a cat.
[08:01:53] <shawwwn> Knocking and “thanking her” would have been clever. I didn’t think of that. But also, it was 2am.

[08:03:02] <quanticle> gwern: Well, one is a lot more likely to get the neighbors to call the cops
[08:03:15] <shawwwn> And yes, we were looking for him all day every day for four days straight
[08:03:18] <quanticle> shawwwn: Sure, but that's still a felony
[08:03:25] <shawwwn> And it happened to be 2am at the time.
[08:03:43] <quanticle> I'm sure the police would have been real sympathetic to that line of reasoning
[08:03:43] <shawwwn> You keep saying that for some reason
[08:03:46] <gwern> quanticle: the point is the neighbors will be more likely to be asleep at 2AM than 2PM, in most places
[08:04:24] <quanticle> gwern: Yeah, but on the flip side, if I hear the door open at 2am, someone's getting shot
[08:04:37] <shawwwn> It was a sunporch
[08:04:44] <gwern> quanticle: she's a little old lady. and apparently prefers the knife
[08:04:48] <shawwwn> It’s like an extra room without insulation
[08:04:58] <quanticle> shawwwn: You keep saying that as if it makes a difference
[08:05:02] <gwern> while you were partying online, she was studying the way of the blade. the *short* blade.
[08:05:20] <shawwwn> I’m saying that because there was very little chance anyone would hear anything.
[08:05:27] <shawwwn> Especially since he was meowing his head off
[08:05:41] <shawwwn> A sound she was no doubt familiar with
[08:05:49] <quanticle> Okay, so entering someone else's house is okay *if you think they won't notice*. Got it.
[08:06:01] <shawwwn> You keep saying things I didn’t say
[08:06:08] <quanticle> No, you keep saying insane shit
[08:06:08] <shawwwn> I didn’t say it was ok. I didn’t say it wasn’t a felony
[08:06:22] <quanticle> So why did you do it?
[08:06:38] <shawwwn> Huh? Because I wanted Scuzzle back
[08:07:50] <shawwwn> He was mine, she had him (and in my opinion mutilated him), and getting him back came with very little risk and effort, whereas getting him back through the courts came with large amounts of both.
[08:07:54] <quanticle> Like, I'm honestly having trouble comprehending the state of mind that one has to be in in order to think that it's okay to open a door on someone else's house, sneak in, and retrieve one's stuff. If it were a yard, I'd be somewhat more sympathetic, but I dunno, my parents have always told me to be careful of going onto other people's property.
[08:08:14] <shawwwn> He was next to the door. I didn’t enter the sunporch
[08:08:28] <shawwwn> I only opened the door, which still counts as entering from a legal perspective

[08:09:03] <quanticle> She would have been within her rights to call the police on you
[08:09:17] <quanticle> Heck, in a lot of places, she would have been within her rights to use deadly force
[08:09:20] <shawwwn> Saying that I opened the door and then snuck in is inventing a story.
[08:09:37] <shawwwn> I am aware
[08:10:32] <shawwwn> It sure is hard to find half and half in a Walmart... milk is easy. Half and half is nowhere to be seen.
[08:10:57] <quanticle> Just get milk and heavy cream and make a 50% mixture on your own?
[08:11:09] <quanticle> Isn't that what half-and-half is anyway?
[08:11:15] <shawwwn> Is it?
[08:11:28] <quanticle> I thought so...
[08:11:36] <quanticle> Obormot\Arcturus: What is half-and-half, exactly?
[08:12:05] <Ralith> it's close enough for fudgemaking purposes, certainly, I do that all the time

[08:12:29] <quanticle> 50% milk 50% heavy cream
[08:12:32] <shawwwn> Good idea. Thank you.
[08:12:42] <shawwwn> I think they’re out of half and half
[08:12:50] <Ralith> heavy cream keeps better anyway
[08:12:57] <Ralith> and is useful for more stuff
[08:13:03] <Ralith> might as well stock them separately
[08:13:20] <shawwwn> Amusingly they’re out of heavy whipping cream too. I think. But we have some at home
[08:13:28] <gwern> 'The only thing to watch out for when buying half-and-half is to never be tempted by the fat-free version. In spite of its name, fat-free half-and-half is just milk that's been thickened with additives like corn syrup. It looks the same on the shelf, but tastes completely different: artificial, not creamy like melted ice cream, but creamy in a melted shaving cream way.' good lord
[08:13:28] <shawwwn> I just never considered putting it in coffee
[08:14:00] <gwern> (aldi was out of small heavy cream today so I bought their big one... 32oz I think. fortunately, if heavy cream ever goes bad, it hasn't happened to me yet)
[08:14:26] <quanticle> >fat free half-and-half
[08:14:28] <quanticle> Good lord
[08:15:01] <quanticle> Man, I have issues with Aldi's supply chains
[08:15:10] <Ralith> I think I had some go bad once?
[08:15:17] <Ralith> the bigger hazard is that it'll de-homogenize
[08:15:17] <quanticle> They haven't had their Benton's brand sandwich cookies in stock for weeks now
[08:15:30] <Ralith> but just give it a good shake before you use it if that's happened
[08:16:28] <saturn2> what kind of disgusting pervert would be "tempted" by fat-free half-and-half
[08:16:44] <gwern> someone who believes fat=bad
[08:16:45] <quanticle> Clearly enough of them to deserve shelf space at a supermarket!
[08:17:00] <shawwwn> Corn syrup is pure evil
[08:17:05] <shawwwn> Probably why it tastes so good
[08:17:15] <gwern> nutrition science has a lot to answer for

[08:17:29] <shawwwn> I guess that’s what happens when you get two full time jobs
[08:18:09] <saturn2> strangely they never have fat-free butter
[08:18:35] <shawwwn> Just thought I’d mention it, since you all seem to have great schadenfreude for me.

[08:21:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: If you really want to confront the mysteries of dairy products, ponder the difference between half-and-half and light cream
[08:22:32] <saturn2> they ought to just keep going with the fat percentages
[08:22:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Half-and-half is simply a blend of equal parts milk and cream. Whereas heavy cream has at least 36 percent fat, half-and-half has between 10 and 18 percent."
[08:22:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> "manufacturing cream, which is 40 to 45 percent fat"
[08:23:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Unfortunately, light cream (16 to 29 percent fat) isn't commonly available in the U.S."
[08:23:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> "So you may have to blend whole milk with either heavy whipping cream (36 to 40 percent) or light whipping cream (30 to 35 percent). "

[08:24:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> 16-18%: could be half and half, could be light cream
[08:24:28] <gwern> saturn2: would fat-free butter just be whey powder?
[08:24:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> 19-29%: definitely light cream
[08:24:43] <gwern> (or a whey drink, I guess, since there's still water in it)
[08:24:46] <saturn2> no they'd have to add some kind of synthetic wax to make it buttery
[08:24:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> 30-35%: light whipping cream
[08:25:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> 36-39%: heavy whipping cream
[08:25:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> 40%: could be heavy whipping cream, could be manufacturing cream
[08:25:21] <saturn2> and some corn syrup for good measure
[08:25:25] <gwern> hm... waxes aren't fats?
[08:25:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> 41-45%: definitely manufacturing cream
[08:25:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> 46+%: ?????
[08:25:48] <saturn2> hydrocarbon-based waxes aren't
[08:25:57] <Ralith> mascarpone, maybe?
[08:26:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Now ask what "double cream" is)
[08:27:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> "UK "double cream" has a butterfat content of approximately 48% and requires special equipment to produce. Double cream is almost impossible to find in the US but can (for $$$) be shipped from the UK."
[08:27:38] <Ralith> creme fraiche supposedly gets that fat

[08:27:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> Apparently you can buy double cream in... Minnesota!!
[08:28:07] <shawwwn> Since I was grilled for every detail of a traumatic experience, I feel justified in talking more about it even though the conversation has moved on: another reason I did it was that we were completely broke at the time, and living with Emily’s parents.
[08:28:27] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: mildly surprising. what's the domestic demand for double-cream? do you need it for double-stuf oreos?

[08:28:56] <gwern> I mean, minnesota has all the udder ingredients, but then there's the 'special equipment' so there must be demand for it specifically
[08:29:05] <shawwwn> And to remove any doubt that she had malicious intent, note that we went back and confronted her with one of the dozens of lost cat posters we had put everywhere, including the grocery store and her neighborhood

As I had way too much time last year, I wrote a fantasy book in Basque, with a Basque witch as my protagonist, and my setting was very loosely based on the 19th century Basque Country, in which all the legendary creatures of …)
[12:12:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> So OP writes a book about witches, and:
[12:12:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> "I was prepared to be rejected because my storytelling sucked, or because my grammar sucked, or because the story had no commercial appeal, or any other reason I could think of. But the reason for rejection they gave me left me flabbergasted."
[12:12:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> "They told me writing a fantasy book in which the witches are real could serve to justify (!) the prosecution against women that happened in the Basque country. They even told me it's considered very controversial."
[12:13:43] <nshepperd2> 'Strange that she felt witchcraft justifies persecution. I think the modern viewpoint is that it is an example of religious intolerance to persecute those who choose to cavort with devils rather than sing in church choirs.'
[12:13:47] <nshepperd2> hehe
[12:15:26] <rsaarelm> Maybe the literature publishing scenes in tiny languages get more weird because there's no mass market potential to balance things out so brahmin scolasticism can run rampant over everyhing?

[22:53:02] <catern> the oh no bubble is saying oh no because it's being left out
[22:53:41] <gwern> ohhh. I thought it was like, someone lying on the ground going oh no oh no
[22:53:59] <gwern> and 'betrayal' meant he was sociopathically stabbing someone while smiling or something, but I couldn't figure out who or why
[22:54:25] <gwern> "I am optimistic I will assassinate Julius Caesar today, the Ides of March"
[22:55:09] <Khoth> It helps to know that every one of that webcomic ends with "oh no"
[22:56:20] <catern> optimistic is a bit of weird word choice too, I guess the author really means "I will be in a good mood today and not let anything get me down" but "optimistic" isn't exactly that
[23:03:08] <kuudes> it seems to me that if it is indeed R~20, then finland would have maybe about a week of seeming normalcy. infections will rise above current delta levels in week 49 (6-12.12), hospitalizations in week 50 (13.12 - 19.12), icu demand around christmas, maybe week 52 (27.12 - 2.1) and deaths in week 1 (3.1 - 9.1)
[23:11:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes, it's a clever subversion of the format, where the blob figure character says "oh no" at the end of each comic, but *this* time, the tables have turned!!
[23:15:31] <gwern> it is indeed droll, although perhaps too rule-breaking to get easily. maybe if the bottom 'oh no' were subtly 3D or more character-like so it looks like a character speaking...
[23:16:09] <Khoth> It's pretty obvious if you're familiar with the webcomic, which the target audience is
[23:16:38] <gwern> so the embedding API seems pretty easy to use. here's a one-liner to embed some text, and get back the engine ID (you'll want to track this metadata because embeddings from different models will be totally different) and then a [1,..n] list:   $ curl --silent 'https://api.openai.com/v1/engines/ada-similarity/embeddings' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer...
[23:16:44] <gwern> ...$OPENAI_API_KEY" -d '{"input": "Sample document text goes here"}' | jq '.model, .data[0].embedding'
[23:16:48] <kuudes> hmm, it appears it indeed might be R<<20, but generation time is maybe much shorter than I considered, ie R~6 but generation maybe 3 days
[23:17:12] <kuudes> which still produces about the same growth rate, but lends to better effects on npis, such as contact reduction
[23:18:12] <gwern> I was worried that OA was going to do something like 'you have to upload texts to our server and we'll do all the similarities and embedding there, don't worry your pretty head' but it looks like they genuinely do give you a real embedding back: https://www.gwern.net/docs/www/misc/xwd-16387336764001716.png

[23:23:35] <Gurkenglas> wait how does it use the GPT models to turn a text into a vector such that similar texts become similar vectors? Wouldn't moving a text forward by one token throw everything off?
[23:24:06] <gwern> ~it's a secret~
[23:24:31] <Gurkenglas> Well then! Have people already done lots of forensic analysis to it?
[23:24:52] <gwern> or maybe they say on the forums, haven't check them lately. anyway, my assumption is that it's the same as iGPT. maybe they did something a little bit fancier like scanned a lot of possible linear combos of layer activations throughout the model to see which one maximizes downstream performance
[23:25:33] <gwern> but yes, of course adding a token to the text will change it, but the global representation of all 2048 BPEs should not change *much* semantically. how much can one token possibly change? usually, very little
[23:25:47] <gwern> you add that final period to an arxiv abstract, the meaning and topic don't change much, do they
[23:30:27] <gwern> anyway I'll implement this like I implemented backlinks... have an embeddings.hs storing (URL,modelID,[Float]) 3-tuples; have a script load that & annotation DB; check that everything in annotation DB has an embedding, and if not, do the curl call to create & store a new one (on a plaintext representation of the annotation metadata+HTML); then for each embedding, calculate cosine distance...
[23:30:33] <gwern> ...against the rest, keep the top 10 URLs, dump as a sorted List to a 'metadata/annotations/similar/$URL.html', and in the annotations proper, add a 'similar' data which links '<a href="/metadata/annotations/similar/$URL.html'" title="List of similar referenes">similar</a>'
[23:30:51] <gwern> all straightforward at this point, just a bunch more little files on disk
[23:32:15] <Gurkenglas> modelID in order to be compatible with future models?
[23:32:59] <Gurkenglas> no that doesnt make sense, you could only compare [Float]s with the same modelID
[23:33:19] <Gurkenglas> so why not just Map URL [Float]?
[23:34:05] <Gurkenglas> (uh, or equivalently [(URL,[Float])]
