[00:00:57] <Guest9> apart from abstract level which books like above & clean code etc. talks abouts, I am also interested at code sentence/function/method level  e.g. while using printing  take care/use of xyz.
[00:02:18] <W> IanWizard, vdamewood; Ideally, pick the /longest/ side (call it the base), so there's no chance you have to care about negative triangles or anything. But yes, the intersection point is best found with matrix math, finding the vector from one end of the base to the third point in the basis made by the base (and its normal in the appropriate direction). It should be optimal, unless there's some special casing like points sharing coordinates; the actual multiplications 
[00:02:18] <W> and additions are few, no division.

[01:05:56] <DPA> But drawing stuff works roughly the same. All just shaders, arrays, indeces, buffers and textures to load, resolve and then telling the GPU to render it.

[01:44:41] <mwbrown> .NET CIL does this sometimes, to generate a native executable

[01:45:11] <vdamewood> This is a different concept from a virtual machine as supported by VMware or Virtual Box, by the way.
[01:45:35] <mwbrown> LLVM also compiles down to an intermediate format, which is then translated to machine code
[01:45:55] <mwbrown> The rust language takes it even further by having their own intermediate format, which THEN goes into LLVM IR, and finally to machine code
[01:46:29] <vdamewood> ______GOD______: Also, in the case of LLVM and gcc, once you get to the .s file, you're out of the compiler and other tools take over.

[06:27:14] <PicklePuffer> why does RPC sound like its lower level if it just uses http
[06:27:29] <PicklePuffer> or is RPC http without a web server
[06:28:46] <oldlaptop> "RPC" is to some extent a generic term; HTTP is often used to implement a Remote Procedure Call system (the common term is "REST API")
[06:29:27] <oldlaptop> there are also at least two specific remote-procedure-call protocols called "RPC", one by Sun (notable mainly for being the basis of nfs) and one by Microsoft

[06:39:37] <Arahael> PicklePuffer: gRPC is an rpc implementation over google protocol buffers.
[06:39:47] <oldlaptop> in common argot, REST now basically means "RPC, implemented over HTTP somehow. JSON is probably involved."

[06:40:55] <yitz> Protocol Buffers are used in constrast to JSON
[06:40:59] <PicklePuffer> why just call it http
[06:41:15] <PicklePuffer> its obvious you could have different serialization formats
[06:41:16] <Arahael> PicklePuffer: gRPC is a specific implementation...
[06:41:20] <yitz> PB serialized the message to binary on the line unlike JSON which makes the network load significantly smaller
[06:41:22] <PicklePuffer> in the payload
[06:41:28] <Arahael> PicklePuffer: nope.  not with gRPC.
[06:41:43] <c705> PicklePuffer: i think you need to learn about the osi model and how networking works in general
[06:42:14] <c705> in short, different protocol suites are better for certain types of data transport needs
[06:42:18] <PicklePuffer> I mean its all binary by time it hits tcp right? and compressed 
[06:42:24] <yitz> https://grpc.io/blog/principles/#payload-agnostic says gPRC is "Payload Agnostic" and lists payloads like JSON and XML
[06:42:24] <Hitchens> Link: gRPC Motivation and Design Principles | gRPC
[06:42:25] <PicklePuffer> so what's difference
[06:42:31] <c705> tcp is one option. udp is another
[06:42:50] <c705> take a networking class. too much to go over in one chat post
[06:42:58] <PlanckWalk> PicklePuffer: Doesn't need to be, no.
[06:43:11] <PicklePuffer> who cares if application protocol uses binary directly or plain text and is optimally compressed
[06:43:14] <PicklePuffer> isn't that same thing? 
[06:43:17] <PlanckWalk> No
[06:43:30] <yitz> gRPC runs over HTTP/2
[06:43:42] <c705> for example, http over udp would be fine for some application that handles its own buffers out of band, whereas tcp might be appropriate for serving a webpage
[06:43:44] <yitz> Compressing JSON will never get you to the same size as protobufs
[06:43:46] <oldlaptop> transparent compression isn't actually universally used, and it's also not going to be as "optimal" as a dedicated binary protocol
[06:44:09] <PlanckWalk> It's also likely to have significantly higher parsing CPU load
[06:44:10] <Arahael> yitz: depends on the data.
[06:44:10] <c705> in short: it depends on the application and the data]
[06:44:18] <yitz> Arahael: Not really
[06:44:22] <PlanckWalk> Which matters if you're Google, for example
[06:44:36] <PlanckWalk> and serving millions of requests per second
[06:44:42] <yitz> protobufs use things like field sizes and offsets to avoid sending metadata that is described by the message format
[06:44:50] <oldlaptop> PlanckWalk: I wonder if they'd deliberately choose something like LZO, if they could
[06:44:56] <Arahael> for aws's cloudflare, you have to explicitly provide a gzip version.
[06:45:17] <yitz> https://grpc.io/blog/principles/#payload-agnostic also mentions "the protocol should allow for pluggable compression mechanisms."
[06:45:17] <Hitchens> Link: gRPC Motivation and Design Principles | gRPC
[06:45:43] <Arahael> yitz: ah, nice, so gRDP also includes compression?
[06:45:57] <yitz> Arahael: I have no idea what gRDP is
[06:46:16] <Arahael> erm, gRPC.  brainfart in my case :(
[06:46:19] <yitz> Network bandwidth tends to be a significantly more expensive resource that CPU
[06:46:32] <yitz> I suspect gRPC has a default compression mechanism or something
[06:46:43] <yitz> Or uses HTTP/2's compression or something
[06:47:07] <PicklePuffer> just seems like if I knew what data im sending I could take advantage of that to optimally compress it 
[06:47:18] <PicklePuffer> vs treating it in general and serializing to binary right away
[06:47:19] <yitz> I'm not overly familiar with the inner workings of gRPC. I just worked as a Google engineer for the better part of a decade.
[06:47:27] <PicklePuffer> seems like a waste of time to me
[06:47:34] <yitz> PicklePuffer: That's exactly what the tooling does
[06:47:59] <yitz> There's a schema where you describe the message format which is used to generate code which optimizing for things

[07:32:47] <PicklePuffer> munkis exactly
[07:33:09] <PicklePuffer> imagine if any other engineer tried to reinvent the wheel 
[07:33:21] <munkis> I thought we were making opposite points?
[07:33:36] <PicklePuffer> or invent their own chemical process for producing wood before building a house 
[07:34:03] <munkis> unless I am wrong about what a dsa test is
[07:34:13] <PicklePuffer> I mean algorithms are fundamental as the wheel
[07:34:19] <PicklePuffer> all that matters is you know how to glue them together
[07:34:43] <PicklePuffer> just like any other engineer glues components together using high level principles from science 
[07:35:02] *** Joins: b1101 (~b1101@ool-44c01641.dyn.optonline.net)
[07:35:22] <PicklePuffer> they dont invent their own chemical process or reinvent the wheel. some things are taken for granted without having to understand the low level details 
[07:35:48] <munkis> however they only glue them together once they've demonstrated that they understand them in isolation.
[07:35:52] <PicklePuffer> do I know how a wheel works physically? No, but I could sure as shit build something with it 
[07:36:16] <PicklePuffer> and I know its a simple machine and could take advantage of that high level principle 
[07:36:27] <PicklePuffer> without trying to make the 'perfect wheel' 
[07:38:28] <munkis> "how would you go about implementing a sort?" "depends on the data but either qsort or '#include "timsort.h'"
[07:38:31] <paulo_> usually in DSA exams, you have to use the right data structure (linked list, hashmap) when appropriate
[07:38:45] <paulo_> and you can also use existing sort functionality
[07:39:02] <paulo_> as long as you can state the time complexity of such implementations

[11:56:54] <fwhnfen> ok so i changed the internal header and cpp for cbuf to use all uint8_t instead of char....
[11:57:50] <selkirk> blahboybaz: No. I meant that if you were certain that the e-mail went to it's destination, have you ever put your life on hold till you get the reply from the recipient?
[11:58:13] <blahboybaz> selkirk: Of course not
[11:59:02] <blahboybaz> So what, asynchronouse means you move on to other things while you wwait?
[11:59:04] <fwhnfen> no bad idea, broke the entire tool chain...
[11:59:19] <blahboybaz> wwait\wait
[11:59:46] <blahboybaz> can't type today
[12:00:11] <selkirk> selkirk: Roughly, it means that you don't wait for a task, generally not under your control, and move on to other tasks while the original task completes.
[12:00:24] <selkirk> blahboybaz: Sorry, that was meant to you.
[12:00:29] <selkirk> s/to/for/
[12:00:37] <blahboybaz> I understand
[12:01:11] <blahboybaz> I guess I had the words backwards asynchronous\synchronous
[12:01:42] <selkirk> blahboybaz: Imagine how inefficient your life would be if you waited for every task you gave other to complete while going through your routine.
[12:01:51] <blahboybaz> So that's the point of promises in js? That you get a gurantee that you'll get some resonponse even if it fails?
[12:01:51] <selkirk> s/other/others/
[12:02:09] <DPA> fwhnfen: In C, its perfectly valid to do "char x=0;unsigned int y=x;". What isn't valid, though, is "char* x=0;unsigned int* y=x;". Neither is "(signed) char* x=0;unsigned char* y=x;".
[12:02:09] <DPA> But things like "char* x=0;unsigned char* y=(unsigned char*)x;" are absolutely fine. But things like, "char* x=0;unsigned int* y=(unsigned int*)x;" is compileable, but may crash. And finally assignments of T* to void* or const void* are always fine.
[12:02:23] <blahboybaz> selkirk: Yeah, that would be pretty bad
[12:02:36] <selkirk> blahboybaz: What I told is the nature of asynchronous programming. It's efficient. But writing asynchronous code is pretty hard.
[12:03:35] <selkirk> blahboybaz: `Promise`, `async/await` are just different syntactical tools to make the task of writing asynchronous code easier.
[12:03:50] <blahboybaz> selkirk: What I don't understand is what you do when something else depends on the result. I mean, how can you move on if the next thing can't do it's job unless the previous thing completes?
[12:03:50] *** Quits: kixx (~kixx@user/kixx) (Quit: Leaving)
[12:04:03] <blahboybaz> Or maybe that's just bad programming
[12:05:01] <neshpion> you can though; you can let the program continue responding to input events, for example.  if the whole program was synchronous, then a long-waited response from something would cause the whole thing to hang
[12:05:45] <blahboybaz> hmm
[12:05:50] <selkirk> selkirk: You don't move on. Imagine you were telling your subordinate to get yourself a cup of coffee. Can you say, "If you don't get coffee, please move to the next shop and buy me a soda instead." Now you that task has not happened yet but there are only some tasks that depend on it and many don't. The art of giving such instructions is the art of asynchronous programming.
[12:06:13] <selkirk> blahboybaz: I'm sorry.
[12:06:22] <selkirk> blahboybaz: I keep quoting myself, lol.
[12:06:41] <blahboybaz> lol
[12:06:57] <fwhnfen> ah how do i fix invalid conversion char to uint8_t and the reverse uint8_t to char when using buffers and pointer things??? casting doesn't help

[12:10:24] <neshpion> asynchrony will come into play if you interface with a remote API

[12:16:58] <selkirk> blahboybaz: There is a loop inside the browser which would keep checking if that task completed just like you would check if you got the reply for the mail from time to time.

[12:21:16] <selkirk> blahboybaz: See, generally in languages like C, you literally won't be able to do anything else. Because your code runs from top to bottom only in that. But with NodeJS, the environment itself is asynchronous. So you could write some function and give it a callback so it would call some other function... and so on while the code execution moves down without completing the function written above it.

[13:38:16] <gnux> yes
[13:38:18] <zephyr_> gnux: If you want neural networks, you might check TensorFlow. But try to get familiar with the absolute basics first. I suppose scikit-learn would have some examples on them.
[13:38:41] <gnux> ok

[13:41:18] <zephyr_> gnux: But in the start, don't worry if you don't get all the math. If you read scikit-learn, you would see you don't implement any models yourself. There are in-built functions for most popular models. Your job mostly would consist of recognising which model to apply and cleaning the data at first.
[13:41:55] <pikapika> Its all in the math. Using a library is mechanical. Its the math that is the hard part.
[13:42:13] <zephyr_> gnux: You would learn the math as you go along for sure. Some linear algebra is required. But it's not particularly difficult. Good luck!

[13:43:00] <pikapika> Yeah its all a scam really. "AI" this, "data science" that. But its a well paying scam so worth learning the "tricks"
[13:43:24] <zephyr_> gnux: There are tricks here and there. There's no such thing as AI. It's not a thing which exists.
[13:43:38] <pikapika> Yes

[13:44:46] <pikapika> rindolf, hi
[13:45:19] <zephyr_> gnux: AI is a strong word used only in movies and sales pitches to fool people. There are some proven methods which work. If you learn to use them effectively, you would be capable of writing code which is capable of doing some intelligent tasks. That's it.

[15:31:04] <mrig> valentinus: you can write OOP in c if you want too. Thing is to understand why it is that it can be advantageous to do this.
[15:31:27] <mrig> ... when to do this and when not to.
[15:31:27] <pikapika> mrig, people uswe classes in C all the time
[15:31:35] <mrig> sure yes.
[15:32:04] <mrig> I would like to code some more C at some point to become even more familiar with this.
[15:32:17] <mrig> will do at some point.
[15:32:19] <valentinus> mrig: I'm saying I don't ever want to use object-oriented code in Python or C/C++. I always want to be able to write code using simple functions like I did before. Is that the wrong way to go?
[15:32:33] <KillerWasp> mrig# you mean OOP like work in GTK?
[15:32:51] <mrig> valentinus: you would find code harder and harder to write, if the project gets bigger.
[15:33:06] <mrig> valentinus: think that complexity grows exponentially.
[15:33:29] <valentinus> mrig: I've seen some object-oriented code in bigger projects which was pretty difficult to understand. Those UML diagrams made my brain hurt.
[15:33:56] <mrig> KillerWasp: I've not used GTK yet, could be; Would you recommend that as a lib to investigate for coding projects in C?
[15:34:21] <mrig> valentinus: try paracetamol or ibuprofen?
[15:34:24] <mrig> :P
[15:34:28] <pikapika> KillerWasp, oop is many things
[15:34:35] <pikapika> Is merely the use of classes oop?
[15:34:40] <pikapika> Then any C project is oop
[15:35:02] <mrig> OOP is about naming things properly.
[15:35:13] <rindolf> valentinus: i dont like uml
[15:35:32] <mrig> If the things that you use to describe your code dont make sense, then it is pretty pointless to use any analogy.
[15:35:55] <KillerWasp> mrig# maybe, but GTK is possibly tiresome to research. What I have seen is that it has a set of functions that creates objects and names them as strings.
[15:35:58] <mrig> valentinus: I think that using OOP well is really hard.
[15:36:01] <valentinus> pikapika: I'm using a software `st` which has some structures and functions, that's it. It has no classes. It's easy enough to understand. I feel like that is the better style.
[15:36:11] <pikapika> OOP is very difficult to properly understand

[15:37:36] <mrig> That's the truth.
[15:37:56] <mrig> And it takes a messy project to grok them I suppose.
[15:37:58] <valentinus> pikapika: If that's really a class, then I'm already doing object-oriented programming.
[15:38:04] <pikapika> Yes
[15:38:12] <pikapika> If you think using classes is oop then yes you are doing oop
[15:38:18] <pikapika> valentinus, that I showed is very much a class
[15:38:22] <pikapika> In fact
[15:38:24] <pikapika> In python
[15:38:38] <pikapika> Class is just nice syntax for methods over the self parameter
[15:38:44] <pikapika> see
[15:38:55] <pikapika> class_method(self,params) is the same as class.method(params)
[15:39:30] <valentinus> pikapika: I know about it. I said that before. The thing is, I need to keep my data structures separate from my functions. Have you ever written code where you have written functions which were not tied to any classes?
[15:39:39] <pikapika> Thats no separation
[15:39:42] <pikapika> Thats still a class
[15:40:28] <valentinus> pikapika: But it's not object-oriented?
[15:40:51] <pikapika> valentinus, it depends on your definition
[15:41:05] <pikapika> Is using classes sufficient to classify as oop? If yes then you are doing oop
[15:41:30] <pikapika> You are using classes, whether you are doing oop or not is a different matter
[15:42:23] <valentinus> pikapika: Let me just reiterate my question because I don't want a petty debate. The kind of style I discussed before, is it something enough or do I need to learn other syntactical sugar like `class` and `a.(x, y, z)` to be a good programmer?
[15:42:38] <mrig> valentinus: I came across and interesting definition the other day that id not heard before, as it has fallen out of favor; Basicaly specifying the difference between a function and a procedure.
[15:42:40] <pikapika> We cannot say without seeing the code
[15:42:54] <pikapika> Not using a class syntax doesn't guarentee you are not actually using classes
[15:43:06] <pikapika> mrig, that it returns a value?
[15:43:13] <valentinus> pikapika: If a Python programmer comes to you and says that he won't ever write `class` in his code, would you advise against it?
[15:43:14] <pikapika> Or the mathematical definition of function vs a 'task'
[15:43:19] <mrig> valentinus: do I need that definition, no, but understanding it is going to help me to code in a way that I find easier to read and to return to.
[15:43:24] <pikapika> Yes I'd say he is dogmatic
[15:43:25] <p0g0> valentinus, why fight it?  The syntax is part of the language you are using.
[15:43:34] <pikapika> But that would also not indicate that his code doesn't have classes
[15:43:38] <valentinus> p0g0: Do you use `goto` in C?
[15:43:40] <mrig> pikapika: yes and procedures alter state where functions do so only minimally.

[15:44:00] <mrig> seems like a pretty logical guideline.
[15:44:07] <p0g0> valentinus, I haven't used goto for many decades, in any language (I don't code BASIC).
[15:44:08] <pikapika> It seems meaningless to me
[15:44:13] <pikapika> I use both kinds of functions
[15:44:19] <valentinus> p0g0: I don't want the feature.

[15:44:33] <valentinus> p0g0: It doesn't feel like a useful feature to me.
[15:44:47] <pikapika> Did FORTRAN have goto?
[15:44:47] *** Joins: Twipply (~Twipply@user/twipply)
[15:44:49] <Arahael> Goto is useful when the language lacks the structured programming structures you need.
[15:44:52] <p0g0> valentinus, goto has earned it's reputation for messing up code and logic.
[15:45:03] <valentinus> p0g0: So have classes.
[15:45:03] <pikapika> Arahael, goto is a useful substitute for exceptions in C
[15:45:09] <pikapika> And for breaking out from deeply nested loops
[15:45:22] <Arahael> pikapika: Yes, because you need to unwind and C doesn't give exception handlign structures to do that for you.
[15:45:29] <GeDaMo> Fortran had computed goto
[15:45:30] <p0g0> valentinus, there is some evidence of that, but if you need inheritance, you need OOP.
[15:45:44] <pikapika> Arahael, so its just goto cleanup; within the function
[15:45:50] <pikapika> and cleanup does the required freeing etc
[15:45:51] <Arahael> pikapika: Indeed.
[15:45:56] <p0g0> GeDaMo, yes, FORTRAN does, but one never used it unless you'd mucked up your logic.
[15:46:03] <pikapika> p0g0, I see
[15:46:31] <valentinus> pikapika: I went to a website called `https://cat-v.org` and there were some opinions of prominent programmers regarding object-oriented programming and I seemed to agree to every single one of them. That's why I'm sold against object-oriented programming. Shall I pull a bunch?
[15:46:31] <Hitchens> Host: cat-v.org`
[15:46:50] <pikapika> cat-v have a specific dogmatic preference

[15:47:24] <valentinus> pikapika: I see. I too prefer *hyper* *minimal* code. I'm asking if that would make me worse as a programmer.
[15:47:38] <pikapika> Any kind of dogma can make you worse
[15:48:12] <mobidrop> minimal code in size or complexitf?
[15:48:12] <p0g0> well, when is dogma style or experience?

[15:48:42] <mobidrop> hahahaha
[15:48:50] <pikapika> You are too dumb to see a class when its staring you in the face
[15:48:59] <Arahael> Could we tone this down a bit?
[15:49:01] <pikapika> Syntactic constructs have nothing to do with having or not having classes
[15:49:12] <p0g0> mrig, I like the notion, but is that a rule about OOP or coding in general?
[15:49:46] <pikapika> And merely using classes may or may not imply OOP
[15:49:56] <amigojapan> Arahael: when he said "quick basic"he meant the user interface not a program made in it like gorilla
[15:49:57] <pikapika> Sometimes its the most natural to couple a data structure and its associated methods
[15:50:18] <Arahael> amigojapan: Ah, fair enough.
[15:50:28] <deniska> OOP is >object< oriented, not class oriented
[15:50:32] <pikapika> valentinus, you haven't showed us your code
[15:50:33] <deniska> if you use objects, you are doing OOP :D
[15:50:38] <mrig> p0g0: General, OOP is one tool that might help with this.

[15:50:45] <pikapika> We cannot say if you used classes there or wrote it more like a pipeline of transformers
[15:51:03] <valentinus> pikapika: It's more of a pipeline. And I wrote in Perl, actually.

[16:13:29] <mrig> what is grouped with what else logically.
[16:13:33] <old_mcdonald> Apple doesn't know gui
[16:13:39] <old_mcdonald> And copying them blindly is asinine
[16:13:46] <amigojapan> mrig: quick and dirty code has an advantage when developing prototypes
[16:14:09] <mrig> Especially when breaking a really complicated domain into working units of functionality.
[16:14:30] <p0g0> Xerox PARC and Alan Kay are usually accredited with the GUI/DOM innovation, Apple just copied a lot of that work.
[16:14:31] <mrig> Best that the programmer knows the domain really.

[16:15:09] <old_mcdonald> p0g0, yes Xerox machines
[16:15:14] <old_mcdonald> Apple stole from Xerox
[16:15:19] <mrig> amigojapan: sure yes, like an artists sketch pad.
[16:15:42] <mrig> Would be really frustrating to do the sketches and then not be aloud to code the actual thing.
[16:15:44] <p0g0> Well, PARC was a think tank more than a photocopier...
[16:15:51] <old_mcdonald> Of course

[16:15:57] <old_mcdonald> I meant xerox machine as in windows machine
[16:16:15] <amigojapan> I agree here mrig 
[16:16:44] <p0g0> PARC was also about sharing innovation, so "stole" isn't really accurate.
[16:16:55] <p0g0> just to be quibblesome
[16:17:05] <deniska> also it's not like Xerox did anything useful with GUI :P
[16:17:08] <old_mcdonald> Windows 95 had excellent gui
[16:17:41] <p0g0> hmm, OS2 had a better desktop in some ways, and heck, that OS actually ran reliably (sort of).
[16:17:52] <amigojapan> old_mcdonald: Amiga had better GUI before that
[16:17:56] <deniska> Win95 explorer was meh
[16:18:01] <p0g0> IBM just never managed to outrun MS.
[16:18:10] <deniska> Also, no quicklaunch, and you can't move around items in the taskbar
[16:18:11] <Arahael> p0g0: They did have OS/2 Warp.
[16:18:15] <old_mcdonald> I don't know about amigas, I will have to research that
[16:18:24] <Arahael> Warp was nice.
[16:18:36] <p0g0> Arahael, I used Warp a lot, running remote BBS's.
[16:19:09] <Arahael> p0g0: It was a bit before my time, but i ran it for a tiny bit, given that it predated win98, it was impressive, and it seemed more stable ,too.

[16:19:44] <p0g0> When my partners tried to jam W95 down my throat, it was a bit of a scene tho.  OS2 was reliable.  Heck, it ended being the OS inside most ATMS for a very long time.

[16:21:36] <Joanna> It seems that freenode has created an irc app called irc.com
[16:21:56] <Joanna> Has anyone tried it ?
[16:22:08] <Arahael> deniska: I have to admit, same here.  I actually installed OS/2 myself from a bunch of abandoned floppies I found in dad's shed.
[16:22:30] <p0g0> Arahael, not too impressive, aye?
[16:22:41] <old_mcdonald> Arahael, hi
[16:22:42] <deniska> you can't even install it easily in a VM because it relies on darker corners of IBM PC which are not emulated as well :)
[16:22:58] <Arahael> Joanna: That was their prior IRC network, I think.  They might be merging freenode and irc or something, nobody knows.
[16:23:10] <mrig> it feels like cheating, just wrapping every function in the math lib, to make a calculator!

[16:25:11] <p0g0> Arahael, what OS2 had at the time was a reliable kernel (viz: NT boot sequence, it calls the OS2 kernel).  The GUI was nice enough, but for someone like me, trying to run remote utility grade stuff, OS2 was the only game in town.

[16:28:10] <Arahael> p0g0: I'm afraid that's all before my time.
[16:28:24] <old_mcdonald> Yes yes internet prices are much nicer now
[16:28:38] <deniska> os/2 could run multiple DOS programs at once much better than win3.11
[16:28:41] <p0g0> Arahael, well, it is a bit obvious to us ancients, that most folks are not so old...
[16:28:57] <amigojapan> mrig: also after a point "buttons look old"is silly
[16:29:00] <Arahael> p0g0: Hmm. :)
[16:29:06] <Arahael> p0g0: I don't feel that young either. :(
[16:29:30] <Arahael> deniska: And yes, it could. I also remember running win3.11 programs really well, too.
[16:29:36] <Arahael> It really was everything windows should have been.
[16:30:01] <Joanna> I got curious and got the app it looks like it’s only for phone not iPad
[16:30:19] <Arahael> That's slack.
[16:30:59] <amigojapan> Joanna: which app?
[16:30:59] <deniska> but then win95 appeared and its DOS emulation was fine, and only fans still used OS/2 :)
[16:31:33] <Arahael> deniska: Remind me again, how did win95 win out?  IT was pre-installed on PC's?
[16:31:54] <amigojapan> deniska: win 95 ran on top of DOS
[16:32:10] <amigojapan> Yes Arahael 
[16:32:40] <amigojapan> Arahael: also os2 was expensive
[16:32:44] <p0g0> Arahael, pre-installed, and MS had that "fist to the market with crap" thing going, so it gained market share aggressively.
[16:32:54] <p0g0> *first
[16:33:02] <deniska> amigojapan: it used DOS for initial boot stages, and some legacy drivers, but it was a perfectly fine OS on its own merit
[16:33:13] <Arahael> amigojapan: Ah, expensive, that would have certainly killed it.
[16:33:14] <Joanna> amigojapan: irc.com
[16:33:22] <deniska> amigojapan: you couldn't just exit win95 to DOS, it required a full reboot
[16:33:43] <amigojapan> deniska: it was just a GUI not an OS
[16:33:56] <Joanna> If it only works in portrait mode it’s useless for me
[16:34:08] <deniska> amigojapan: you can say that about win3.11, it had "quit to DOS" button, win95 replaced DOS with its own kernel during boot
[16:34:12] <p0g0> OS2 was pricey, but anyone trying to run a reliable system, especially one that you couldn't just reboot when the GUI overfloed and locked the machine, those folks needed OS2, regardless of $.

[20:34:58] <Valware> on a related note, if I may butt in, I've noticed a lot of people who are very good programmers tend to be muli-ligual. I think learning more languages with their different structures can improve your mind as a programmer
[20:35:06] <old_mcdonald> vdamewood, do you speak arab/hebrew
[20:35:21] <vdamewood> I've studied Arabic, but not so much Hebrew.
[20:35:23] <Valware> multi-lingual also
[20:35:47] <p0g0> I think we can credit the ancient arab math wizs with 0, bringing us Boole and Booleans, and hence, programming.
[20:36:06] <vdamewood> p0g0: Nope. India.
[20:36:14] <p0g0> hmm, ok

[23:30:58] <ZenixOwler> GeDaMo: i guess Python also got influenced by it ? by seeing it simply just as "  Transcript show: 'Hello World'."
[23:31:07] <Guest9> or those 2 are abstract concepts & can be applied in several other cases as well?
[23:31:51] <GeDaMo> "Transcript" is an object, "show" is a message and 'Hello World' is a parameter

[23:53:33] <old_mcdonald> Obviously
[23:53:39] <Guest9> so most OOP are abstract/high level langauges?
[23:53:40] <old_mcdonald> And some languages can make it very hard to do
[23:53:41] <ZenixOwler> i don't think recommending him to use C for learning OOP is a great idea tho
[23:53:47] <old_mcdonald> I am guessing it can be rather hard to do oop in haskell

[23:54:19] <ZenixOwler> C itself is still considered a high level language
[23:54:21] <old_mcdonald> I think anything else as a first language is just going to end up with the person having a very wrong model of computers in their head
[23:54:23] <davve> prefer that over C++
[23:54:29] <old_mcdonald> I might recommend C++ as a second option
[23:54:36] <old_mcdonald> But C++ could be overwhelming to learn in 2020
[23:54:47] <whatsupboy> old_mcdonald: why?
[23:54:54] <old_mcdonald> whatsupboy, its a vast language
[23:55:01] <ZenixOwler> Guest9: Python is high-level as well, but it abstracted so many things that programmers took days and lots of efforts to write and debug in C 
[23:55:02] <whatsupboy> c++ is very good option to learn in 2021
[23:55:03] <old_mcdonald> And there are a lot of different styles in place

[23:55:10] <old_mcdonald> whatsupboy, I meant as a first language
[23:55:43] <old_mcdonald> As an intermediate maybe learn some C then switch to C++ to understand oop? But that isn't a good idea in 2020
[23:55:50] <ZenixOwler> yea, don't start with something too abstracted first, or people will be dull later on, C is fine
[23:55:58] <ZenixOwler> try Assembly as well if someone wanna go harsh
[23:56:00] <old_mcdonald> ZenixOwler, its not just about dullness
[23:56:01] <old_mcdonald> Its like
[23:56:07] <old_mcdonald> If someones first language is js
[23:56:14] <old_mcdonald> They will just have a completely incorrect model of a computer
[23:56:20] <mrig> go would make a good starting language too.
[23:56:24] <ZenixOwler> yea, especially when it's browser's JS
[23:56:30] <GeDaMo> C is not an entirely accurate of a modern computer either
[23:56:32] <whatsupboy> old_mcdonald: I would start with c++ as my first language as an adventure. I don't understand why programming communities degrade human intelligence with Hard/vast terminology
[23:56:37] <GeDaMo> ^model
[23:56:38] <old_mcdonald> Things that are easy for computers turn into very hard problems in js and vice versa
[23:56:54] <old_mcdonald> GeDaMo, of course it isn't

[23:57:00] <ZenixOwler> Guest9: also by "Abstracted" i meant making things less confusing and difficult 
[23:57:05] <old_mcdonald> But starting with computer architecture and machine language isn't a good idea
[23:57:18] <old_mcdonald> C is a good balance between hardware and abstracted high level languages and actually useful and useable too
[23:57:21] <Guest9> old_mcdonald C++ is higher level language of C?
[23:57:32] <ZenixOwler> you can tell by looking at the ++ :P
[23:57:34] *** Joins: ______GOD______ (~GOD@user/god/x-9778998)
[23:57:41] <old_mcdonald> Guest9, C++ is much more higher level, though it also offers almost all features that C does
[23:57:43] <GeDaMo> List concatenation? :P
[23:57:46] <ZenixOwler> if something has ++ but not --, it's higher

[23:58:08] <old_mcdonald> C++ was initially intended as a superior C
[23:58:23] <davve> old_mcdonald: it has all the feautrees C has and more, it is considered a superset right
[23:58:27] <old_mcdonald> And most C is also valid C++ today too
[23:58:31] <old_mcdonald> davve, almost so
[23:58:37] <old_mcdonald> Some features like const work differently
[23:58:42] <old_mcdonald> and some features of C aren't in C++
[23:58:42] <old_mcdonald> etc
[23:58:57] <GeDaMo> It's not a strict superset
[23:59:03] <old_mcdonald> GeDaMo, yes
