[02:30:13] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> `else: assert false` is the easiest but depending on the type you can do some other things
[02:30:16] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> What's the type, and what's the of branches
[02:32:22] <FromDiscord> <el__maco> the type is GLenum. The type can probably contain a million different things, but in my case there's only 3 values it can have
[02:33:03] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Ah well if they arent contiguous values the assert method is the best
[02:33:15] <FromDiscord> <el__maco> hmm

[03:42:42] <FromDiscord> <codic> i know destructors are at end of scope

[09:30:02] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> cheers
[09:40:00] <FromDiscord> <treeform> caches are very smart, are you sure you can detect the performance drop?
[09:43:42] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> Not that it will necessarily, but I will be doing optimisations with cache lines in mind. If the cpu uses a different architecture to what is quite standard then I can't be sure if things like false sharing will crop up. Simply providing a warning that I can't necessarily accomodate those structures with the original software design.
[09:58:38] <FromDiscord> <demotomohiro> Just use less memory and access memory as linearly(less randomly) as possile is not enough to write fast code? Do we really need to know the cache line size to do that?

[10:07:49] <FromDiscord> <demotomohiro> If cache line size is 64 bytes, 64bytes object type is more efficient than 60 bytes object type?

[13:02:02] <FromDiscord> <hugogranstrom> üèúÔ∏è
[13:02:06] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> and it is very disheartening that this is what is coming out
[13:02:31] <FromDiscord> <dom96> @ElegantBeef oh? Where did this happen? Maybe I have some reading to do as well
[13:02:41] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> It was in #offtopic
[13:02:46] <FromDiscord> <dom96> And the more important question: did Kiloneie apologise when called out on it?
[13:02:52] <FromDiscord> <dom96> Remember: Stefan still has not
[13:02:52] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Nope
[13:03:05] <FromDiscord> <dom96> and you all are happy to defend and deflect
[13:03:10] <FromDiscord> <dom96> That's not cool
[13:03:20] <FromDiscord> <saem> What the actual fuck?
[13:03:20] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> I'm not deflecting i've got no horse in this race
[13:03:23] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> god damn, someone just linked a book
[13:03:25] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> I feel ashamed that my desire to ensure new members receive appropriate welcomes to grow the community is being overridden by this garbage. I am disappointed.
[13:03:37] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> now we are back to this crap about kilo
[13:03:42] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> who asked?‚Üµ(@dom96)
[13:03:53] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> The conversation is on the linking of media, and giving a more welcoming message to newbies
[13:03:57] <FromDiscord> <saem> Sometime spread hate and you're standng on ceremony,
[13:04:11] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> was this discussion about a book or we are having 101 on how to drop down to personal insults?‚Üµ(@dom96)
[13:04:16] <FromDiscord> <saem> [Edit](https://discord.com/channels/371759389889003530/371759389889003532/905389327649996801): Someone is spreading hate and you're standing on ceremony,
[13:04:24] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> From what i've read stefans book is fine and this is 100% just pointless fueding
[13:05:07] <FromDiscord> <dom96> I think it's fair to bring up an example of when somebody was not kind when somebody says explicitly they found them to be kind
[13:05:24] <FromDiscord> <dom96> especially when I find it hard to believe the person saying they are kind is unaware of this discussion
[13:05:30] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> yeah, sure one person had a positive experience
[13:05:37] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> now time to throw shit at them
[13:05:38] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> so nice
[13:05:53] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> Ôªøcabboose\: found stefan be a good person
[13:05:54] <PMunch> Who's the nicest person in the Nim community? Could we have them write a book on Nim to avoid this weird personal insults when the question of who's resources to share with newcomers comes up?
[13:06:06] <FromDiscord> <Rika> What happened to separation of the creator and the work
[13:06:08] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> quick, we need to bring up old crap
[13:06:10] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> I think it's you pmunch
[13:06:20] <FromDiscord> <dom96> In reply to @Rika "What happened to separation": good point
[13:06:22] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> to put more dirt
[13:06:30] <PMunch> @Elegantbeef, shit..
[13:06:50] <FromDiscord> <Kiloneie> Can we all relax please, this will not lead anywhere good.
[13:06:52] <PMunch> Fuck you @Elegantbeef!
[13:06:54] <FromDiscord> <Rika> If the work has the same issues of the creator then it should matter IMO
[13:07:06] <PMunch> Phew, dodged a bullet there, who's the nicest person now?
[13:07:14] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> I am a little busy right now pmunch maybe next week?
[13:07:20] <PMunch> Haha :P
[13:07:21] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> well, the work does not have any "same issue" except for couple line note about not documenting async
[13:07:24] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> I understand if there are issues between people. I am discontent that you are making this a bigger deal than what should really be at the centre of the communities concern -\> difficulty in converting newcomers to nim. I pointed out that the initial response by a moderator was dissatisfactory. I specifically mentioned and promoted kiloneies response. I am heavily disappointed in the moderating team involved.
[13:07:38] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> That is brought up as an act of treason against whole nim community
[13:07:42] <FromDiscord> <dom96> FWIW I haven't read the book, I don't have anything against it. But I find it highly suspicious that you are specifically linking to it
[13:07:51] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> what
[13:07:52] <FromDiscord> <dom96> when you were yourself concerned about the discussion I had with Gumber
[13:07:56] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> the
[13:07:56] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> fuck
[13:07:57] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> holy shit
[13:08:02] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> the book is good
[13:08:05] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> is it wrong to link it?
[13:08:09] <FromDiscord> <dom96> hax, can you stop with the holy shits please? üôÇ
[13:08:13] <FromDiscord> <dom96> it just raises the temperature
[13:08:18] <FromDiscord> <dom96> there is no need for it
[13:08:22] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> oh no, dom suspects stefan of somewhat unethica behavior
[13:08:33] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> If you would look at the issues in Stefans tracker, you would see I am one of the authors of those issues.
[13:08:37] <FromDiscord> <dom96> well, you're misunderstanding me
[13:08:40] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> now we need to label any link of stefan's work as suspicious
[13:08:40] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> I have long since been promoting Stefans book
[13:08:40] <FromDiscord> <dom96> I'm not suspecting Stefan
[13:08:42] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> as I found it to be an excellent resource
[13:08:56] <FromDiscord> <dom96> then I apologise for being suspicious
[13:09:24] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> For me to give the real reasons as to why I link his resource over others would be suggesting I insult those other resource authors.
[13:09:25] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> well, you said he was rude‚Üµ(@dom96)
[13:09:28] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> I don't mean "suspect", I mean that you said stefan was rude to kilonete
[13:09:38] <FromDiscord> <dom96> Yeah, because he was.
[13:09:53] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> He criticised a publication
[13:09:55] <PMunch> I have to say I agree with @cabboose on the original point that a moderator just posting a link to the documentation without any other words comes across as a bit of "RTFM noob"
[13:09:57] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> He didnt attack kilo as a person
[13:10:02] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> And then you say "But I find it highly suspicious that you are specifically linking to it"‚Üµ"when you were yourself concerned about the discussion I had with Gumber"
[13:10:04] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> That's not rude that's critcism of art
[13:10:11] <FromDiscord> <dom96> PMunch: I agree as well.
[13:10:15] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> is it not possible for a person to make a good book then?
[13:10:29] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> what about separation of the person and their work
[13:10:39] <FromDiscord> <dom96> But I think it's fair to note that Stefan's book might not be right for the general target audience that are learning Nim
[13:10:40] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> I understand if you think this was some sort of attack due to that gumber situation involving Stefan; I am upset because I think that it is a shallow view of me if you think that is what is at play.‚Üµ(@dom96)
[13:10:47] <PMunch> @Elegantbeef, while he did criticise the video it was done in a pretty harsh tone..
[13:10:57] <FromDiscord> <dom96> Yep ^
[13:11:00] <FromDiscord> <hugogranstrom> In reply to @dom96 "But I think it's": Disagree
[13:11:08] <FromDiscord> <dom96> In reply to @hugogranstrom.nim "Disagree": care to elaborate? üôÇ
[13:11:14] <PMunch> Not picking sides here, just pointing out that it's not the fact that he criticised the video which is the concern
[13:11:15] <FromDiscord> <dom96> his book is aimed at kids
[13:11:15] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> I don't think so, the book is good as a general resource for learning nim‚Üµ(@dom96)
[13:11:43] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> Considering you are have not read it even, this is a very strange thing to say‚Üµ(@dom96)
[13:11:51] <FromDiscord> <hugogranstrom> In reply to @dom96 "care to elaborate? üôÇ": Read it and you'll see that it contains a lot of stuff people who come from Python like me have very much use for
[13:12:02] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> I disagree. I have read both your book and his book. I find his book to be fantastic. Your book is also good. You have clearly targetted different audiences. I would suggest his book first as it targets a lower level audience first. You mentioned you had not read the book, so I find it difficult to take your comments on the matter as being based on evidence.‚Üµ(@dom96)
[13:12:31] <FromDiscord> <dom96> I am basing what I say on what I read Stefan speaking about his book
[13:12:38] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> He says that from a position of having a PhD in University. I personally found the book to be perfect for my level (having no computer science background).‚Üµ(@dom96)
[13:12:56] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> > ‚Üµ> But indeed the videos are not bad, they reminds me to lessions of some of our teachers in school. Sometimes it was hard to stay awake -- and maybe the teachers did not understand the stuff they presented well too. Today some people are not able to read longer text segments, and I think for these people the videos of Mr. Kiloneie are really helpful to learn some Nim.‚Üµ>
[13:12:57] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> The fact it targeted on kids does not mean it never goes into anything advanced
[13:12:59] <FromDiscord> <dom96> And also as somebody that has written a book I know it's important to keep target audiences in mind
[13:13:02] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Man he really killed kilo here
[13:13:17] <FromDiscord> <dom96> it's not about advanced or not, it's about how much you explain
[13:13:24] <FromDiscord> <dom96> over-explaining is a sure fire way to make people give up
[13:13:26] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Like yes it's harsh but it's also constructive criticism it's not just "you're shit kid git gud"
[13:13:38] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> I am flabbergasted by this.‚Üµ(@dom96)
[13:13:47] <FromDiscord> <dom96> Why?
[13:14:09] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> have you read the book? "over-explaining" os so subjective
[13:14:10] <PMunch> @Elegantbeef, oh for sure, the criticism itself is actually pretty good
[13:14:17] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> Because there is no truth in that. And it goes against every principle of education and science that is important to me.
[13:14:21] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> for a person with no experience in let's say macros
[13:14:29] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> what would be the correct level of detail?
[13:14:38] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> someone comes from java and they meet nim macros
[13:14:57] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> they are like kids at this stage really - no understanding of the domain. So you'd better explain things thoroughly
[13:15:06] <FromDiscord> <Araq> the correct level of detail is always "I don't want to document async because the core devs might lose interest in it"
[13:15:12] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> everyone as a beginner at some level of programming stuff
[13:15:17] <FromDiscord> <Araq> seriously...
[13:15:29] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> yeah, sure, four-line note on the end of the book is the worst offense there is‚Üµ(@Araq)
[13:15:32] <FromDiscord> <dom96> haxscramper: programmers don't usually meet macros, so yes, they should be explained thoroughly
[13:15:39] <FromDiscord> <dom96> most programmers on the other hand know about if statements etc
[13:15:45] <FromDiscord> <dom96> so they can be explained in less detail
[13:15:53] <PMunch> @haxscramper, fair enough. But I but down the "Head first Java" book I read as a kid because it was so basic that I felt it didn't go anywhere
[13:15:53] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> Is that actually what this is all about?‚Üµ(@Araq)
[13:16:05] <FromDiscord> <dom96> A target audience of "knows at least one other language" is several orders of magnitude different to "is a kid"
[13:16:20] <PMunch> Had to find something a bit more up-tempo in order to feel like I was going anywhere
[13:16:25] <FromDiscord> <dom96> like... how is this even controversial? lol
[13:16:51] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> sent a code paste, see https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=3DPb

[13:17:52] <PMunch> Everyone has their favourite resource, and the way the topic is now where everyone chimes in with their favourite resource is great to see

[13:17:53] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> what is wrong with linking it?
[13:17:53] <FromDiscord> <saem> What's controversial is the deflecting that isn't investigating potential hate speech.‚Üµ(@dom96)
[13:18:04] <FromDiscord> <Rika> I feel like you are all just having some sort of miscommunication issue
[13:18:05] <FromDiscord> <dom96> In reply to @saem "What's controversial is the": I'm waiting for logs
[13:18:17] <FromDiscord> <dom96> Very happy to have a look
[13:18:24] <FromDiscord> <dom96> or for other mods who dealt with the issue to comment
[13:18:25] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> Yes; why wasn't this the first response from dom and Araq?‚Üµ(<@709044657232936960_=50=4dunch=5b=49=52=43=5d>)
[13:18:29] <FromDiscord> <saem> Go search yourself
[13:18:30] <PMunch> Sure the initial response leaves something to be desired, but arguing about which book is the one true book to link sounds an awful lot like arguing religion..
[13:18:37] <FromDiscord> <hugogranstrom> In reply to @dom96 "yes, they are both": Why do we have this discussion then? üôÉ
[13:18:52] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> because dom started it
[13:18:56] <FromDiscord> <dom96> @hugogranstrom because I think other books/resources are likely to fit people's experiences better
[13:18:58] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> so we have it
[13:19:00] <FromDiscord> <dom96> most Nim learners aren't kids
[13:19:53] <FromDiscord> <dom96> PMunch: I don't think so
[13:20:03] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> I should probably leave the conversation now because I am so incredulous over how this has all gone down. I am honestly disappointed in the handling of this situation. I would wish @dom96 and @Araq would care more about welcoming a new member than creating a rift in this channel over my choice of literature to link to the new member.
[13:20:20] <FromDiscord> <dom96> I care a lot.
[13:20:27] <FromDiscord> <dom96> But there is nothing to argue about there
[13:20:27] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> By which I wish I could link and introduce myself, however the forum has proved impossible for me to correctly verify sign up to over 5 attempts
[13:20:29] <FromDiscord> <hugogranstrom> In reply to @dom96 "<@!454991120028663809> because I think": Then mention other resource in addition to it, not as a you must read this instead-replacement

[13:21:17] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> That thought is driven by the ridiculous situation we have before us.
[13:21:32] <FromDiscord> <dom96> In reply to @hugogranstrom.nim "Then mention other resource": That is what I want. I don't think we should be just linking to Stefan's book is all I am saying
[13:21:53] <FromDiscord> <Rika> That‚Äôs not what you implied
[13:22:00] <FromDiscord> <Rika> That‚Äôs what I thought by miscommunication issue
[13:22:13] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> and why shouldn't we again, if people find it a good learning resource
[13:22:14] <FromDiscord> <dom96> yeah, there are always miscommunications because we clearly don't trust each other
[13:22:17] <FromDiscord> <dom96> I have very good reason to not
[13:22:19] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Just can‚Äôt chat right now, busy
[13:22:22] <FromDiscord> <Rika> But I‚Äôm reading and yeah
[13:22:34] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> Such a disappointing comment to make. Loathe the person who has spent time trying to make a resource for the community. Loathe the person who tries to ensure a new member gets a welcome.‚Üµ(@dom96)
[13:22:39] <FromDiscord> <dom96> But I don't want to get into that now
[13:22:57] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> Rue the day I make a resource myself, because as it stands, I think you would ensure it is never linked to any person who might benefit from it.
[13:23:31] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> From what I think, this has all been based on your person opinions of Stefan. This is not what professionals should be doing.
[13:23:33] <FromDiscord> <hugogranstrom> In reply to @dom96 "That is what I": Then make a better effort to convey that message instead next time :) And not as you did today
[13:23:47] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> This has certainly been trained in my career, but I think that it has not in yours.

[13:24:47] <FromDiscord> <dom96> I mean objectively I specifically mentioned target audience
[13:25:00] <FromDiscord> <dom96> Haven't mentioned anything about Stefan's personal character when we started this discussion
[13:26:42] <FromDiscord> <Rika> He said ‚Äújust‚Äù his resource, he thinks it‚Äôs fine to link it yes but it‚Äôs always better to link more is what he means I think

[13:58:49] <FromDiscord> <hugogranstrom> In reply to @Araq "I read it and": It's the "." under the link that gives the impression of "sigh, RDFM". Totally unnecessary addition to the message
[13:59:14] <FromDiscord> <tandy> as said above, i would also expect miran to send some nice welcoming message if they were to reply to forum posts - i would expect this of paid community people‚Üµ(@Araq)
[13:59:52] <FromDiscord> <Araq> I think that's a forum bug, it won't render as a link without the dot XD
[13:59:53] <FromDiscord> <tandy> some simple copy & pasted message would work even, doesnt necesarily have to be hand written each time
[14:00:13] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> yeah, @hugogranstrom about the dot specifically - in this case it's the fault of the forum

[14:05:58] <FromDiscord> <narimiran> try making a message on the forum with just a link, it won't be properly rendered - you need some extra character, and i chose dot. no hidden meaning there.

[14:13:19] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> I mean it is not exactly our missing to educate people on how to google or RTFM, so yes, in response to the "Trying to learn nim! Any advice?" it is justified to put up a templated "hello" message

[14:14:08] <FromDiscord> <Benjamin> I'm happy to see this discussion becoming much more constructive. However, maybe we should have a separate "meta" or "community" channel for such discussions; I doubt that's what most people are in this room for.

[14:32:28] <FromDiscord> <Jan81> well well.. lots of things happening here..
[14:39:00] <FromDiscord> <Araq> we aim for 1.6.2 fixing regressions, 2.0 will make --gc:orc the default. The plan doesn't constantly change either.
[14:40:24] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> What about concepts, view types, lazy semcheck that have been mentioned, changes in nimble, tooling improvements (that seem to be the most wanted feature of all), IC and so on.
[14:41:36] <FromDiscord> <Araq> view types improved quite a lot in 1.6.0 and get more fixes for 1.6.2
[14:42:59] <PMunch> Having a more official roadmap would indeed be nice
[14:43:13] <PMunch> Maybe something we could put on the web-page?
[14:43:14] <FromDiscord> <Araq> lazy semcheck depends on timothee and he's on holidays and is not scheduled for any particular release
[14:43:46] <FromDiscord> <Araq> of course it doesn't help that I'm skeptical of the approach and have alternative ideas but I'm always trying to stay objective (believe it or not)
[14:44:15] <supakeen> objectiveness?! in open source?
[14:44:30] <FromDiscord> <Araq> tooling improvements and IC are the same thing to me. make IC work well and nimsuggest doesn't have to be a server
[14:44:40] <FromDiscord> <Araq> it can be a one-shot command line tool then

[14:45:08] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> I'm mostly talking about what community could expect wrt. to already announced semi-experimental features, not internal implementation details
[14:45:20] <FromDiscord> <tandy> make a blog post talking about the direction of nim, do some communication, or make it obvious from the repo milestones / projects
[14:45:28] <FromDiscord> <Araq> very easy for editors to ask the compiler then as there is no process management complexity
[14:45:47] <FromDiscord> <tandy> its imposible to know what is currently happening in nim without scouring the repo for commits/ issues / prs
[14:46:43] <FromDiscord> <Araq> sorry, I wasn't aware
[14:47:18] <FromDiscord> <Araq> the problem for me is probably that the plan doesn't change, it feels like a looong way to go though
[14:47:41] <FromDiscord> <Araq> and the slow progress on IC is frustrating
[14:48:03] <PMunch> Having a more stable Nimble experience would be awesome!
[14:48:36] <PMunch> But yeah, if there is a plan, even just the stuff you've outlined here, and it doesn't change a lot, why not create a page about it on the website?
[14:48:41] <PMunch> People keep asking for it
[14:48:45] <FromDiscord> <dom96> Having a roadmap would be nice
[14:49:08] <FromDiscord> <tandy> thats okay, i think the community needs a better method for communicating with core team because weve been moaning about this for months in this channel‚Üµ(@Araq)
[14:49:20] <FromDiscord> <tandy> some method where we can get a response and the core team is held accountable
[14:50:15] <FromDiscord> <tandy> i think thats what used to happen in the weekly meetings? not sure i never went to one but having those again would be really good if possible..
[14:50:33] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> it happened then somehow disappeared suddenly
[14:50:37] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> it also shifted format
[14:50:41] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> first one was the best
[14:50:55] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> last one was about compiler internals, which is a lot more niceh
[14:51:19] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> yes it is a "developer" meeting technically, but at the same time first one started with discussing of the current state of nim development
[14:51:26] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> and it was informative for everyone involved
[14:52:06] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> not only for a handful of people who actually contribute to the compiler, but for everyone
[14:54:49] <FromDiscord> <tandy> if weekly is too often, it could be done less often too
[14:56:06] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> I talked about it earlier, but it does not even have to be a real meeting, some kind of regular bi-weekly/montly posts on the website/forum are also fine
[14:56:31] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> The main question is that you need to drill down the github repo, or personally talk to one of the developers to see where are we heading
[14:56:50] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> or what is the current state
[15:01:23] <FromDiscord> <tandy> @Araq\: what do you think?

[15:22:57] <FromDiscord> <dom96> I've been very positive about it and even asked you to implement a bunch of stuff in it. Is it that you just don't have bandwidth?

[15:47:07] <FromDiscord> <lenis> Its a bit annoying that you cant use procedures until they are defined in the file. I like to define the highest level functions at the top
[15:48:00] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> you can forward-declare everythign
[15:51:49] <FromDiscord> <el__maco> I also like to define functionality in a top-down fashion. I've been using ``{.experimental: "codeReordering".}`` and so far its been working wonders
[15:53:25] <PMunch> Oh yeah, that is also an option
[15:53:37] <PMunch> @Zajt, did you figure out your issue?
[15:53:47] <PMunch> It seems like you drowned a bit in other stuff
[16:00:01] <FromDiscord> <impbox [ftsf]> Yeah code reordering saves me a lot of time
[16:01:12] <FromDiscord> <Zajt> In reply to @PMunch "<@290456415963709440>, did you figure": Nope not yet
[16:02:15] <PMunch> So you have a type and a proc trying to use that proc in the same file and the proc doesn't see the type?
[16:02:22] <PMunch> Is the type defined before the proc?
[16:03:11] <FromDiscord> <Zajt> Nope after
[16:03:21] <PMunch> It needs to be before
[16:03:29] <FromDiscord> <Zajt> Maybe that's the issue but it didn't complain for that on the other type I have which is also at the end of the fiel
[16:03:32] <FromDiscord> <Zajt> (edit) "fiel" => "file"
[16:03:42] <PMunch> Hmm, that sounds strange
[16:04:21] <FromDiscord> <Zajt> So I think the issue is with the type somehow, or the syntax with it
[16:08:00] <PMunch> Then it's hard to help out without looking at the source
[16:09:37] <PMunch> @Zajt, but the type definitely needs to be defined first: https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=3DQy
[16:09:39] <FromDiscord> <evoalg> what is code reordering?
[16:09:58] <PMunch> It tries to reorder your code into something that allows Nim to parse it
[16:10:24] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> `{.experimental: "codeReordering".}`
[16:10:24] <PMunch> For example proc1 which calls proc2 is going to be moved to below proc2
[16:13:25] <FromDiscord> <lenis> In reply to @haxscramper "you can forward-declare everythign": what do you mean
[16:13:54] <FromDiscord> <impbox [ftsf]> In reply to @haxscramper "you can forward-declare everythign": Pretty sure I couldn't forward declare an iterator
[16:13:59] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> sent a code paste, see https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=3DQA
[16:14:04] <FromDiscord> <Benjamin> The docs look pretty good for this feature with several examples\: https://nim-lang.org/docs/manual_experimental.html#code-reordering
[16:14:17] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> `proc1()` is a "high-level" procedure, so if you want to put down highest-level fist
[16:14:35] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> and then increase granularity, that's what this feature is for
[16:15:03] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> though I don't understand this feature at all
[16:15:15] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> I would just read code from bottom to top if it was structured this way
[16:18:16] <FromDiscord> <el__maco> you want the details first and high level code at the bottom?
[16:18:55] <FromDiscord> <Rika> personally thats how i read
[16:19:14] <PMunch> I read diagonally from the bottom right to the top left
[16:19:18] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> Yes, I'm used to this way of writing from basically every compiled language
[16:19:19] <FromDiscord> <el__maco> to me that makes no sense, but each to their own I guess
[16:19:36] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> And also I don't want global implicit transforms in the code
[16:22:06] <FromDiscord> <Rika> i mean yeah its prolly to do with how we think
[16:22:21] <FromDiscord> <lenis> for me it makes more sense with high level at the top because i always start with writing high level functions, and break it down into detail/helper functions as I go
[16:22:55] <FromDiscord> <lenis> so with high level at the top you write the files top to bottom which is more natural
[16:22:55] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> I write types first
[16:22:55] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> And I put them on toplevel as well
[16:23:00] <FromDiscord> <lenis> and you also get to read the code top to bottom which is even more important
[16:23:03] <FromDiscord> <Solitude> i write types and lower level procs first
[16:23:17] <FromDiscord> <Solitude> and you dont read source files like a fucking book, you search throught them
[16:23:36] <FromDiscord> <lenis> you never search through books?
[16:23:39] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> well, a lot of times you just read
[16:23:52] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> At least I read a lot of times
[16:23:58] <FromDiscord> <Solitude> In reply to @lenis "you never search through": how is that related
[16:24:44] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> For example some GH project - it is easier to just open it, look through modules just to see the general architecture
[16:25:02] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> Than to clone, or just around in different tabs/files searching
[16:25:09] <FromDiscord> <lenis> anyway, the way i like is is where the information at the top explains how to use it, the lower down you go the more it becomes about implementation
[16:25:22] <FromDiscord> <lenis> so, imports, then types, then exported procs then implementation procs
[16:25:33] <FromDiscord> <Rika> In reply to @lenis "for me it makes": i conceptualise high -> low but i write low -> high
[16:25:47] <FromDiscord> <Solitude> In reply to @lenis "anyway, the way i": and how is that different from just having it reversed?
[16:26:05] <FromDiscord> <lenis> you mean imports and types at the bottom?
[16:26:12] <FromDiscord> <Rika> are we arguing about anything
[16:26:18] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> Well, I would say I do rougly the same, except for procs, but I don't maintain high discipline in code, so it is kind of mixed‚Üµ(@lenis)
[16:26:22] <FromDiscord> <Rika> if not then what are we talking about exactly
[16:26:22] <FromDiscord> <lenis> i mean, its different because you will have to scroll down if you want to know how to use the exports in a file
[16:26:32] <FromDiscord> <Solitude> wow
[16:26:44] <FromDiscord> <lenis> and you read the procs top to bottom but the proc definitions bottom to top which doesnt make sense
[16:27:19] <FromDiscord> <Rika> so do you proclaim reading japanese in the traditional style (top down right to left) doesnt make sense because its not how you do things?
[16:27:57] <FromDiscord> <Rika> whatever, i shouldnt argue about this
[16:28:00] <FromDiscord> <Rika> nothing to argue about
[16:28:49] <FromDiscord> <lenis> lol
[16:29:27] <FromDiscord> <lenis> thanks for the tip about the codeReordering feature. works great
[16:30:46] <FromDiscord> <el__maco> yea I love it. It works with variables and types too
[16:31:49] <FromDiscord> <el__maco> its neat that I can use a variable that's something ugly like a glsl shader in a string, and define the string somewhere way below

[22:34:09] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> @qb\: üëå
[22:35:04] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> I've forked it and patched it a little,  but iirc only the windows side
[22:37:07] <FromDiscord> <that_dude> In my definition, I am using `T = object`, How would I return var T? I keep getting `got <type var Error Type>`
[22:37:20] <FromDiscord> <that_dude> (edit) "`T" => "`type T"
[22:38:41] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> @that_dude\: that sounds strange
[22:38:55] <FromDiscord> <that_dude> Like what do I put after the `:` in the first proc definition line, and what goes after the return?
[22:39:07] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> Code?
[22:41:17] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> Ah I see, try to make the object a 'ref object'
[22:41:35] <FromDiscord> <that_dude> Trying to move it to the playground
[22:41:50] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> In the typedef
[22:41:51] <FromDiscord> <that_dude> Isn't there a high chance that it will cause issues else where?
[22:42:15] <FromDiscord> <that_dude> This is the only time I want it to to return a mutable? object
[22:43:10] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> MH I thinks it's possible to return a var object when the parameter is also var
[22:43:37] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> But I'm on mobile and can't test
[22:45:24] <FromDiscord> <that_dude> https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=3CGD I think this shows my issue
[22:47:19] <FromDiscord> <that_dude> I'm kinda hoping there's an easy change to `var Action_event` and `return var a` to make it work
[22:50:20] <FromDiscord> <that_dude> Well `T = ref object` works so I'll use it, I just hope there won't be any issues due to not planning on using the ref originally
[22:51:51] <FromDiscord> <that_dude> I guess as a follow up, is there safe alternative to ptr and addr that works in almost the same way? Or is `type T = ref object` the only way?
[22:52:01] <FromDiscord> <leorize> @that_dude\: I'm not sure what are you trying to do from that sample
[22:52:18] <FromDiscord> <leorize> you're trying to get a mutable view to an array entry, right?
[22:52:21] <FromDiscord> <that_dude> yeah
[22:58:38] <FromDiscord> <leorize> https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=3DTM
[22:58:39] <FromDiscord> <leorize> ^ is that what you're looking for?
[23:04:22] <FromDiscord> <that_dude> While yes, I think I have a similar form but it isn't working for me. I do have in iterator in the proc to find the correct one
[23:05:40] <FromDiscord> <that_dude> Also I'm saving the object to a `var` after finding it so I can poke at it to see if it has the info I care about
[23:06:38] <FromDiscord> <that_dude> Doesn't `=` do a deep copy be default or something?
[23:07:41] <FromDiscord> <leorize> in that case you'd have to use `views`
[23:07:48] <FromDiscord> <leorize> which is an experimental feature that doesn't work
[23:08:01] <FromDiscord> <leorize> `ref` might be your best bet then
[23:09:06] <FromDiscord> <that_dude> Alright, thanks man
