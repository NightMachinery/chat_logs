[12:21:28] <[twisti]> im working to implement a system in php that does the following: we get IPs, which we need to use as (one of many) vectors to determine whether a request comes from the same person (the system behind it is akin to voting, and multiple votes from the same IP suffer a penalty in the algorithm that decides whether a vote is legit). but we dont want to store IPs, because GDPR and well, who wants to store IPs if they dont have to ?

[16:56:43] <NeatNit> hello. I am a bit lost about setting up JWT. Context: I want my raspberry pi to act as a git + git-LFS server. Git works as needed via SSH. Unfortunately git-LFS is not so simple, but the simplest-looking implementation I could find is this: https://github.com/AKSW/git_lfs_server_sshauth
[16:58:08] <NeatNit> the way it's supposed to work is: you run git-lfs-authenticate as a command via SSH, and that will give you a JWT to access the actual LFS server, which is running this: https://github.com/AKSW/git_lfs_server_sshauth/blob/master/git_lfs_server.psgi
[16:58:34] <NeatNit> (in reality, the client-side git-lfs will run that command for you when you push/pull)
[16:59:46] <NeatNit> now, the way it seems to be set up "by default" is that you have this wrapper https://github.com/AKSW/git_lfs_server_sshauth/blob/master/git-lfs-authenticate-wrapper.c which makes a request to the web server https://github.com/AKSW/git_lfs_server_sshauth/blob/master/git_lfs_server.psgi#L113-L136

[17:08:31] <NeatNit> I think I am slowly starting to make sense of this. HS256 is symmetric, right? so the thing that generates the tokens will need to know the same secret as the thing that receives them?
[17:09:45] <soulisson> NeatNit, wait a second. I'm not sure to understand what you want to prevent. You want to prevent unauthorized to make authentication requests to the web server?
[17:09:57] <piou> NeatNit: a JWT is really simple. It has three informations: the token content that is readable by anyone, the message authentication code or signature that validates that you are the one that created the JWT and a metadata field that says how it's been signed/MAC. There are two possible algorithms: RS256 that is asymmetric (so, signature) and HS256 which is symmetric (so MAC). You should use
[17:10:01] *** Quits: uoj6wz6qoswb (~VqGbTsxz~@user/spareproject) (Remote host closed the connection)
[17:10:03] <piou> RS256. That will require generating a public/private key and keeping them safe, but it's solid. If you use HS256 you're not done for, but you need to realize that anyone able to guess or find the secret key will be able to generate their own JWT. So RS256 is to be prefered.

[17:12:23] <NeatNit> piou, both the public and private keys would have to be kept secret then?
[17:12:31] <piou> NeatNit: "encrypting with a private key" is not a thing, the private key is used to decrypt or sign. It happens that, in the very specific case of RSA, signing is mathematically close to what you'd do if you used the private key as a public one, but that's an implementation detail.

[17:18:22] <NeatNit> alright, so far so good :)
[17:18:35] *** Joins: spanishsunrise (uid393013@id-393013.stonehaven.irccloud.com)
[17:18:53] <piou> NeatNit: So you send this data, and add a signature or MAC (two mechanisms to verify integrity and authenticity, we say signature if it's asymmetric and mac if it's symmetric that's all)
[17:19:11] <soulisson> NeatNit, in your specific case the public key will be used to encrypt the symetric key which is going to be used to encrypt your jwt claims and sign the token.
[17:19:16] <piou> That way when you get the JWT you can verify the signature/mac and see if it fits, proving that you produced it.
[17:20:25] <NeatNit> alright. so let's say I want to sign a JWT that says "this user is authorized to download file A"
[17:20:41] <NeatNit> I would sign it
[17:20:42] <piou> If you use RS256, then a signature is used, ie it's asymmetric (because it relies on RSA). To produce a signature you use the private key with your data. That private key is private, secret, because anyone with it can generate valid signatures. What you share (at least with your server) is a public key. Anyone with the public key can verify the signature.
[17:20:59] <NeatNit> ugh, just did a bunch of wrong keyboard button presses, uhh
[17:21:34] <NeatNit> yes. okay, just ignore my last message. seems a smaller disaster than I thought, just opened a random browser window :P
[17:21:43] <piou> If you use HS256 then you only have one key which is used both for production and validation. Anyone finding that key can generate valid tokens. Also no other person can validate the authenticity of the token.
[17:22:26] <NeatNit> I see. In my case both options seem just fine.
[17:22:30] <piou> RS256 is both safer (because there's no secret that has to be shared and can be guessed) and more flexible (because anyone can verify the message, opening nice applications.
[17:22:39] <piou> So when in doubt use RS256.
[17:23:31] <soulisson> NeatNit, I want to add that there are several types of JWT. Some of them are unencrypted others are encrypted. Your web applications use encryted tokens.
[17:23:42] <soulisson> *encrypted
[17:23:50] <NeatNit> it can use whatever I want it to use! (does it though?)
[17:23:54] <piou> soulisson: does it?
[17:24:02] <piou> I don't think it does
[17:24:18] <NeatNit> https://github.com/AKSW/git_lfs_server_sshauth/blob/master/git_lfs_server.psgi#L146-L150 I couldn't really understand what this does
[17:24:18] <soulisson> piou, yes, I believe so from what I read.
[17:24:23] <NeatNit> I'm not a perl guy
[17:24:42] <NeatNit> but this is the bit where it dec(odes? rypts?) the token
[17:25:04] <NeatNit> jwt_dec is defined above
[17:25:41] <soulisson> my $jwt_enc = 'A128CBC-HS256'; => The encryption/decryption algorithm and the HMAC algorithm
[17:25:52] <piou> Hmm, it looks like it does. Damn developers mixing up encoding and encryption and coming up with bad names because of that
[17:26:17] <soulisson> my $jwt_alg = 'ECDH-ES+A128KW' => The asymetric encryption/decryption algorithms for encrypting the symetric key

[17:26:36] <NeatNit> soulisson, I may end up changing that anyway though.
[17:26:56] *** Joins: mossman93 (~quassel@user/mossman93)
[17:27:09] <piou> So a JWE isn't that complicated. As I said JWT only cares about authenticating your data. What you can do is encrypt the data you are sending. Of course that demands another round of key management etc. JWE is a JWT with some fields to manage this encryption/decryption step at the JWT level essentially.
[17:27:57] <NeatNit> piou, I think I just won't do that, I am editing this script anyway (to remove the /token_factory endpoint)
[17:28:07] <soulisson> NeatNit, if you change it, then choose what piou talked about. You can choose public/private key for signature or a secret string for authentication code
[17:28:22] *** Joins: darksun (~darksun@user/darksun)
[17:28:32] <NeatNit> so for HS256 the secret string can literally be ANY string? no format limitation or anything?
[17:28:47] <piou> It's important to realize that anyone can read a JWT by default. It may not be an issue, many JWT only contain something like {"user":"piou","role":"admin"} where what matters is that it can't be modified. But if they do contain more sensitive information then it is very important for it to be encrypted, and JWE is a standard to streamline that.
[17:29:02] <NeatNit> I don't mind, piou. it's just an authentication token.
[17:29:41] <NeatNit> ah, I see. hmm. I wonder...
[17:29:45] <piou> NeatNit: yes and no. Any string is valid, but it's a secret, you want to use a string that no one can guess and as it won't be used by humans anyway the best (and really only reasonnable approach) is to use a long random string. Take 40 chars and be done with it.
[17:30:29] <piou> If your string is somehow leaked then anyone with it can generate valid token with whatever data they want, resulting in complete authentication bypass.
[17:30:37] <NeatNit> okay! but the thing is I don't have to use some fancy tool that generates a file that has to start with -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
[17:30:47] <piou> Not at all indeed
[17:30:50] <soulisson> NeatNit, any way you could also proceed with an ssh tunnel if you don't want to expose your web application on internet
[17:30:59] <NeatNit> piou, that's true for any key though. I'll keep it safe.
[17:31:38] <NeatNit> soulisson, I haven't heard of ssh tunnel, but I'm 99% sure that my server will have to be accessible via http(s)://... from the internet. can SSH tunnel do that?
[17:32:23] <soulisson> NeatNit, yes, but one could get a token and try to guess your secret. If it's too short or easy to guess, the attacker will be able to generate his own valid token
[17:32:52] <NeatNit> I'm now wondering if I want to encrypt it or not. but for now let's assume I just want to sign it and the contents aren't secret.

I couldn't see any SQL dumps on the install for which direct access wasn't blocked by the server. Perhaps there is a rogue plugin, I am not sure. Their webhost is running a security scan.
[21:27:37] <aruns> It could be that a user account, perhaps an admin user, is compromised.
[21:27:43] <aruns> Am I missing anything obvious?

[21:28:58] <skill> with wordpress, it could be a lot :) but usually it's from an insecure plugin or admin account
[21:29:24] <skill> i've seen WP sites get popped through an admin account, attacker install plugins that intercepts auth traffic to reuse those creds
[21:30:13] <soulisson> also I did not understand that "I couldn't see any SQL dumps on the install for which direct access wasn't blocked by the server". Do you have SQL dumps on the host?
