[01:06:42] <MootPoot> also - I wonder if its even worth trying to get this rifle to spec

[01:08:16] <Fenderbassist> K0K1: there are better ways to encourage kids

[01:08:59] <MootPoot> so they'll act out in different ways
[01:09:07] <K0K1> Fenderbassist ; youre right, tie them to a chair a make them watch saw 7 and tell them thats what happens when u disobey your parents
[01:09:15] <MootPoot> its a lot easier to bait with incentives

[01:12:21] <MootPoot> Maybe I should just forget about it and get a real rifle 
[01:12:43] <Fenderbassist> when it comes to converted Milsurps, I would find out what is do-able and what isn't, before sinking money into it
[01:13:06] <Fenderbassist> Mausers are great rifles as long as you can get the ammo and if they weren't damaged during modding
[01:13:18] <MootPoot> I has a gunsmith look at it 
[01:13:21] <Fenderbassist> .30-06 should be plentiful
[01:13:27] <Fenderbassist> if the action can handle it
[01:13:32] <Fenderbassist> i.e. if it was done correctly
[01:13:37] <MootPoot> He told me it probably isn't worth paying him for it, but the guy killed the stock 
[01:13:56] <MootPoot> And told me if it could get around 1moa then maybe 
[01:14:11] <MootPoot> But with the current stock it just hurts to shoot 
[01:14:13] <MootPoot> I can't 
[01:14:24] <Fenderbassist> you can save it as a project for the future
[01:14:31] <Fenderbassist> when you have more disposable income to play around with
[01:14:35] <MootPoot> Yeah, I guess

[02:44:03] <sentionics> supplementing B1 (thiamine) certainly made a difference from me and kept some more serious effects at bay in the past. A B complex supplement would probably be more complete, but I drink lots of milk which is probably fine too.

[09:44:59] <JesseDesu__> thats what manic does to you
[09:45:03] <Satin> that isn't a list though
[09:45:13] <Satin> the first part is a list and taht's fine, that's what i do everyday recently and it's succesful

[09:45:22] <Satin> the second part is a stress list and that's a new idea i got from that reddit post

[09:45:53] <JesseDesu__> i didnt read the whole post yet

[09:49:32] <JesseDesu__> ok
[09:49:46] <Satin> you develop a robust personal life philosophy 
[09:49:54] <Satin> but at the same time make sure to keep the system open to adaption
[09:50:06] <Satin> because any system that is unable to adapt will fail over long periods of time
[09:50:24] <Satin> be it regulation, which is eventually gamed by corporations looking to exploit loopholes, or electrol systems, or personal goal systems
[09:50:52] <Satin> but at the same time you don't want to be excessively open either and question every single thing or have no concrete backbone foundational principles 
[09:51:36] <Satin> it's like how the courts in the UK might say, or the legal system might suggest that the ultimate authority "comes from the sovereign" (i was just reading the wikipedia page for the monarchy yesterday following the news Prince Andrew has been stripped of his royal titles)
[09:52:07] <Satin> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom
[09:52:07] <ImoutoBot> [title] Monarchy of the United Kingdom - Wikipedia
[09:52:40] <Satin> "The sovereign is deemed the "fount of justice"; although the sovereign does not personally rule in judicial cases, judicial functions are performed in his or her name. For instance, prosecutions are brought on the monarch's behalf, and courts derive their authority from the Crown. The common law holds that the sovereign "can do no wrong"; the monarch cannot be prosecuted for criminal offences. The Crown Proceedings Act 1947 allows civil lawsuits against 
[09:52:40] <Satin> the Crown in its public capacity (that is, lawsuits against the government), but not lawsuits against the monarch personally. "
[09:53:23] <Satin> where things derive their authority from is an interesting topic, sometimes i hear people tell me that human rights don't "actually exist"

[11:34:39] <STUXNET> fuck no
[11:34:43] <MootPoot> DIY is more like 80-100
[11:34:46] <STUXNET> it's kinda pricy too
[11:34:52] <STUXNET> for me to be messing around
[11:34:58] <STUXNET> and i'm less comfortable with mac than windows
[11:34:59] <MootPoot> yeah just remote it
[11:35:00] <MootPoot> in
[11:35:02] <STUXNET> no
[11:35:05] <STUXNET> i mean i could but
[11:35:11] <STUXNET> the laptop is working save for that N key
[11:35:12] <STUXNET> you feel me
[11:35:17] <STUXNET> maybe i can give it to one of my sisters 
[11:35:20] <STUXNET> if that's fixed
[11:35:21] <MootPoot> I know - I know your process
[11:35:29] <MootPoot> I have a laptop with the same problem
[11:35:32] <STUXNET> i can remote in on my other laptop though
[11:35:32] <MootPoot> I get your feel
[11:35:33] <MootPoot> just dont
[11:35:35] <STUXNET> a dell latitude
[11:35:42] <STUXNET> with arch on it
[11:35:45] <STUXNET> well endevourOS
[11:35:46] <STUXNET> not pure arch
[11:35:52] <STUXNET> just haven't been using it
[11:35:59] <MootPoot> well - I guess macbooks are better documented then rando HP laptops 
[11:36:01] <STUXNET> i3WM is a bit of a bitch to get working with three external screens tbh
[11:36:05] <MootPoot> but still, I suggest against it
[11:36:13] <STUXNET> yeah i won't DIY taht shit
[11:36:16] <STUXNET> i already got fed up
[11:36:23] <MootPoot> I DIY regularly - and I'm telling you not to
[11:36:24] <STUXNET> when i realized macbooks can't run linux strightforwardly
[11:36:27] <STUXNET> cringe af
[11:36:32] <MootPoot> unix time
[11:36:34] <STUXNET> not down for troubleshooting that shit
[11:36:45] <STUXNET> so i ran windows when i used to use that macbook
[11:36:54] <STUXNET> bootcamp moment
[11:37:03] <STUXNET> it was my windows laptop
[11:37:07] <STUXNET> with mac exterior
[11:37:08] <STUXNET> funny
[11:37:55] <MootPoot> I enjoy macos for what it is
[11:38:00] <STUXNET> i don't
[11:38:15] <MootPoot> unironically - its the only thing that's made using a laptop bearable
[11:38:24] <STUXNET> it seems pretty UI friendly if you're into it I guess
[11:38:26] <MootPoot> their UI and interfacing
[11:38:38] * STUXNET has no desktop so...
[11:38:40] <MootPoot> I dont constantly regret not having a full mouse and KB when I'm using it 
[11:38:48] <MootPoot> unlike literally every other laptop
[11:38:55] <STUXNET> i always have my laptop hooked up to my monitors and external kb and mouse so
[11:38:56] <STUXNET> lol
[11:39:14] <MootPoot> I mean - cant bring that along with me when I'm 300km out into the forst
[11:39:17] <mixfix41> you dont really like now do you
[11:39:18] <MootPoot> forest*
[11:39:31] * senti blesses all of you here now, with extreme good luck! You shall all do well now, in 2022!
[11:39:32] <STUXNET> mixfix41: like?
[11:39:38] * STUXNET curses senti 
[11:39:44] <STUXNET> just kidding
[11:39:49] <MootPoot> what if that new kid , k0 something is just the older, worse iteration of the robot that is mixfix41 
[11:39:53] <MootPoot> lmao
[11:40:01] * senti smacks the curse down, and laughs with you.
[11:40:08] <STUXNET> should i eat another pizza..........slice
[11:40:10] <STUXNET> m
[11:40:17] <STUXNET> but it's literal bread it's disgusting
[11:40:18] <MootPoot> I mean you already fucked yourself in the ass
[11:40:21] <STUXNET> but at the same time....... mm
[11:40:23] <MootPoot> why not
[11:40:27] <STUXNET> yeah i guess
[11:40:33] <STUXNET> the thing is
[11:40:36] <senti> STUXNET, pizza is important. Always respect it. Always... eat it.
[11:40:42] <STUXNET> i'm only saying this because i'm stressed af :|
[11:40:47] <STUXNET> by that academic warning bullshit
[11:40:59] <STUXNET> all these past few days i havent' been feeling like that at all
[11:41:00] <STUXNET> grrr
[11:41:00] <MootPoot> academic warning?
[11:41:02] <MootPoot> GPA too low?
[11:41:03] <STUXNET> yeah
[11:41:09] <STUXNET> except it's bullshit
[11:41:18] <STUXNET> So
[11:41:31] <STUXNET> that kicks in at this school if you have a culmuative GPA of 2.0 or under or whatever
[11:41:35] <mixfix41> theres a lot of laptops to pick and choose ofcourse everyone will like theirs?
[11:41:39] <senti> STUXNET, your body has been telling you, your mind has been telling you, something isn't right. hence you're in a bind now.
[11:41:41] <STUXNET> the thing is, i've never had a culmative GPA at this school at all
[11:41:48] <STUXNET> Fall 2020 - 2 As, 1 B, 1 D
[11:42:18] <STUXNET> Spring 2021 - get shot right before the semester begins. not attended at all. emailing professors and administrators that i'm unable to make it
[11:42:32] <senti> STUXNET, it's a pain getting the motivation to actually find your true motivation. Sounds redundant but I'm being real.
[11:42:52] <STUXNET> Fall 2021 - withdrew from all classes because uh, untreated PTSD is not good and trying to force things when you're not ready doesn't work. 
[11:42:54] <STUXNET> so you see
[11:43:06] <amigojapan> Time for coffee. I am falling asleep
[11:43:08] <senti> STUXNET, what do you truly want to do? fuck college, what do you really want to do
[11:43:08] <STUXNET> i don't have a culmative GPA anywhere lol
[11:43:12] <amigojapan> Hey senti

[11:44:15] <STUXNET> i've never been to montana
[11:44:47] <STUXNET> it's like a placeholder in my head for living out closer to nature, in semi-contemplatiion, away from the neurosis of the urban city life
[11:44:53] <senti> MootPoot: come live in Louisiana instead. The humidity will make your masochism happy
[11:44:55] <STUXNET> i live in rural new mexico currently somewhat
[11:45:06] <STUXNET> and i've fallen in love with these parts

[11:47:04] <Satin> senti: lol
[11:47:09] <MootPoot> I'm not particularly complaining about not going outside though - its just every time you bring up exercising outside I point at the reality

[11:49:20] <MootPoot> I prefer dry cold really
[11:49:37] <MootPoot> I dont have complaints with the weather here
[11:49:58] <senti> it is 2.93 C here now.
[11:50:03] <MootPoot> aside from one thing - it keeps my city kinda small = harder to do niche things but that's a really small drawback
[11:50:18] <MootPoot> is about freezing here , next week its going to go back to -40C
[11:52:47] <senti> MootPoot, that's insane cold.
[11:54:07] <senti> I'll stick to hot weather and spicy food thanks.
[11:54:22] <MootPoot> cold weather and spicy food is a better combo
[11:54:40] <senti> compromises be like...
[11:54:48] <MootPoot> I've been in +45C and -45C  --- let me tell you , -45C is better
[11:54:55] <amigojapan> MootPoot: according to technology connections, you can easily cool your house using a swamp cooler in dry heat places, for a very low price
[11:55:16] <senti> MootPoot, so long as we have electricity, it's not bad here.
[11:55:29] <senti> hmmm, actually, I'm going to turn the A/C on. It's too hot in my apt.
[11:55:30] <MootPoot> where are you at again senti ?

[11:58:05] <senti> no. I buy that at wal-mart.
[11:58:29] <MootPoot> I wish they stopped calling stuff like lousiana hot sauce and tabasco hot sauce
[11:58:30] <MootPoot> its really not
[11:58:46] <senti> also, louisiana hot sauce sucks. I recently found Melinda's Creamy Ghost Pepper Wing Sauce at my local wal-mart though. It's really good stuff.
[11:58:52] <MootPoot> same
[11:59:01] <MootPoot> I discovered melindas wing sauce recently
[11:59:10] <MootPoot> unfortuantely my only source is amazon - 10 bucks a bottle

[11:59:29] <MootPoot> are the other melindas any good?
[11:59:39] <senti> I've only had the creamy ghost pepper
[12:00:00] <senti> I want to try their other stuff though

[12:17:59] <MootPoot> There is that Lian li case for 500 or something that looks like a yacht 
[12:18:14] <amigojapan> Am I being picked on from being Mexican again?
[12:18:24] <Satin> doesn't seem like it
[12:18:31] <amigojapan> Ok
[12:18:55] <MootPoot> Pretty sure only drug dealers would get that one either 
[12:19:08] <MootPoot> !g Lian li boat case

[12:19:38] <amigojapan> MootPoot: many people like art
[12:19:49] <Satin> MootPoot doesn't get art
[12:20:07] <Satin> s/get art/get what art is/
[12:20:16] <amigojapan> I see
[12:20:20] <ButterNoodle> I'd rather my video card be on the poop deck
[12:20:25] <amigojapan> Anime is also art
[12:20:34] <MootPoot> Satin: there is art.. And then there is having a 18 carat gold chain hanging around your neck with the letter B in diamonds 
[12:20:40] <MootPoot> This is the latter 
[12:20:55] <Satin> MootPoot: idk this didn't seem exactly oriented to be about sheer vanity, but who knows
[12:21:05] <MootPoot> The boat case? 
[12:21:15] <Satin> oh
[12:21:39] <amigojapan> MootPoot: from what I heard saganman's mom dresses in gold and diamonds, and she is not a drug dealer
[12:21:40] <Satin> no comment on that
[12:22:11] <Satin> MootPoot: does have a point
[12:22:17] <amigojapan> Different culture
[12:22:20] <Satin> rappers wearing a bunch of gold and being flashy isn't art 
[12:22:38] <Satin> excessively spending lots of money for a 2k case isn't art either
[12:22:55] <Satin> it's entertaining probably and pleasurable probably, but i doubt it's anywhere close to having artistic value
[12:22:57] <MootPoot> like you can rationally justify  the 2k spending depending on what the case is 
[12:23:05] <Satin> yeah that doesn't make it "bad"
[12:23:06] <MootPoot> I'm not outright saying its dumb
[12:23:11] <Satin> unless you judge excess a bit like i do
[12:23:15] <Satin> but it's def not art lol
[12:23:23] <amigojapan> Satin: but my idea of the fountain with real plants case was going to be art
[12:23:27] <Satin> not sure what atistic message that has
[12:23:38] <Satin> amigojapan: oh yeah, this was more about the earlier topic of df ch's case
[12:23:48] <amigojapan> Ah ok
[12:24:07] <Satin> I'm not really sure about your project's details but it doesn't seem like it was just flashy for the sake of being flashy i guess
[12:24:24] <Satin> and there are def artists out there trying to merge cyborg/computers with natural elements
[12:24:29] <MootPoot> like, a 2k case that would be worth it could be a PC designed to work in a very dirty atmosphere like a pc for controlling industrial wood cutting - it would need to use the mass of the metal to cool itself off
[12:24:38] <MootPoot> since you cant use fans in that environment
[12:24:41] <MootPoot> etc
[12:24:49] <Satin> MootPoot: what about for just being a consoomer huh
[12:24:51] <Satin> :p
[12:24:56] <Satin> lamborghini, biaatch
[12:25:01] <MootPoot> yeah then that's drug dealer 
[12:25:38] <amigojapan> MootPoot: you could use water cooling
[12:25:39] <MootPoot> somebody on discord told me to go to sleep
[12:25:49] <Satin> MootPoot: yeah go to sleep
[12:25:52] <MootPoot> amigojapan: water cooling is just active air cooling wiht extra steps
[12:25:59] <MootPoot> like - you still have to have a radiator 
[12:26:06] <MootPoot> that has fans on it
[12:26:11] <amigojapan> Ah right
[12:26:15] <JesseDesu> the only thing that cools anything is outer space
[12:26:27] <Satin>  cool warm dn
[12:26:29] <JesseDesu> ultimately everything radiates to outer space
[12:26:37] <Satin> everything radiats to my mind
[12:26:42] <Satin> you're all a fig-
[12:26:51] <amigojapan> MootPoot: actually I think some work with peltier elements for cooling
[12:27:19] <MootPoot> that still requires a fan 
[12:27:19] <Satin> !define s
[12:27:21] <Satin> !dict s
[12:27:28] <Satin> !g peltier
[12:27:28] <MootPoot> you need to cool the other side of the peltier
[12:27:29] <ImoutoBot> Satin: Thermoelectric cooling - Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoelectric_cooling> | Leonard Peltier - Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Peltier> | Peltier - Thermoelectric Cooler Modules - TE Tech Products <https://tetech.com/peltier-thermoelectric-cooler-modules/>
[12:27:35] <MootPoot> unless its a really small one
[12:28:11] <JesseDesu> thermodynamics is hard
[12:28:15] <MootPoot> Satin: it sounds cool in the wiki but IRL its just a waste of power
[12:28:16] <JesseDesu> math
[12:28:19] <MootPoot> in almost every case
[12:28:27] <Satin> MootPoot: lol
[12:28:47] <MootPoot> the numbers dont work out to be useful 
[12:29:09] <MootPoot> there are VERY specific cases where it can be useful like in space
[12:29:10] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I don't think you need a high specs computer in a wood workshop. Just get an RPI
[12:29:27] <MootPoot> amigojapan: you cant just cram any computer you want in there lol
[12:29:41] <MootPoot> enterprise equipment wont work with a random computer 
[12:30:18] <MootPoot> only what its programmed to work with for liability reasons - which these days is like an airgapped windows XP machine or some massive FPGA
[12:30:31] <amigojapan> Universal computing machines
[12:30:41] <MootPoot> in theory
[12:31:36] <MootPoot> but also the wood shop is just a simple example - something more specialized like silicon manufacturing or automomobile robots in the welding or paint stops
[12:32:37] <amigojapan> Ok I can see more computing power needed for an automotive robot controller
[12:33:32] <MootPoot> even if a RPI was capable of it - why would any company trust millions of dollars of production and oppoutuintiy cost to a consumer tier board that was never tested to that kind of standard
[12:34:22] <MootPoot> imagine if you made a product and sold it - using a Rpi - the Rpi stopped working and now the person who bought it from you is suing you for 500k USD in damages / lost production value
[12:34:35] <MootPoot> for something that was out of your hands
[12:35:11] <amigojapan> MootPoot: c64s have been used to control CNC machines
[12:35:36] <MootPoot> yeah - after a few million dollars in contracts and testing
[12:36:48] <amigojapan> Maybe
[12:37:13] <MootPoot> its the same reason why large FOSS projects like moodle get paid millions for support
[12:37:28] <MootPoot> sure , its FREE, but who is going to pay the damages or help if it breaks?
[12:38:00] <Bco1981> as a company you chose to use a FREE product... suck it up.
[12:38:09] <MootPoot> ^
[12:38:17] <amigojapan> O don't think enterprise support pays for damages
[12:38:32] <Bco1981> unless you pay for services.
[12:38:37] <MootPoot> but then the guy in the company who used that free thing has to take the blame on himself
[12:38:52] <MootPoot> unless they paid for support as well , in which case he can cover himself and point at them
[12:40:51] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I would guess a company that has robots doing work would be paying for some kind of insurance in case of damages
[12:41:17] <MootPoot> they would, but the insurance companay dosen't want to pay if possible
[12:41:44] <MootPoot> so what do they do to try and not pay? They try and make it the fault of the manufacturer who sold them the hardware
[12:42:27] <MootPoot> There are a few exceptions to this rule , afaik companies which have no other option
[12:42:51] <MootPoot> like the people who make the machines for semiconductor manufacturing - literally nobody else can make them
[12:43:20] <MootPoot> so both TSMC and that other company will do whatever they can to keep relations positive
[12:43:26] <amigojapan> MootPoot: there are high quality single board computers that are for like this kind of purpose too. My client sells those
[12:43:34] <amigojapan> They are expensive
[12:43:35] <MootPoot> yep
[12:43:52] <MootPoot> they aren't expensive becasue of the hardware - they are expensive because of the responsibility

[17:08:45] <amigojapan> darkwitch: yeah. And listening to the life problems of one of them

[17:10:38] <amigojapan> darkwitch: my cram school has classes on so many things. Not just English
[17:11:16] <amigojapan> darkwitch: and the policy is "do what the student wants
[17:11:53] <amigojapan> darkwitch: even one user from this channel takes Japanese lessons online with my cram school
[17:12:23] <darkwitch> it sounds more like it's for having fun than for getting into some other school then
[17:12:46] <amigojapan> darkwitch: it's not for getting into another school
[17:14:00] <amigojapan> darkwitch: one student asked me to teach her to play chess
[17:14:16] <darkwitch> then why is it called cram school? the name is no longer relevant
[17:14:31] <darkwitch> A cram school, informally called crammer and colloquially also referred to as test-prep or exam factory, is a specialized school that trains its students to achieve particular goals, most commonly to pass the entrance examinations of high schools, or universities.
[17:15:42] <darkwitch> they should just call it the Have Fun with Amigojapan Club
[17:15:46] <amigojapan> In Japanese it is called Â≠∞which is read juku, which is often translated as "cram schoo

[17:30:48] <DunceCotus> or a weapon against terrorism could be not looking at it in that framework

[17:41:31] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: and I also remember the cornucopia. To be honest. But I could be wrong

[18:59:26] <Satin> you shouldn't be pressured either way, just be you.

[19:03:36] <HubertFarnsworth> can't you people have normal conversation?
[19:03:39] <Satin> HubertFarnsworth: the thing is, I haven't had a single semester with actual grades since Fall 2020. I withdrew from all my classes last semester, and the semester before that I was suffering in the hospital from gunshot wounds so obviously didn't attend
[19:03:53] <HubertFarnsworth> what's MLK?

[19:04:50] <Satin> anyways yeah
[19:04:52] <MootPoot> not a real thing
[19:05:52] <Satin> HubertFarnsworth: So the school doesn't have valid grounds to be doing this to me, but because bureaucracy and stupid computer systems probably
[19:06:37] <amigojapan> Good night everyone
[19:06:40] <Satin> I even discussed my options with the dean of academic affairs last semester, who acknowledged my situation and even encouraged me to withdraw from classes etc

[19:08:08] <darkwitch> too quick
[19:08:21] <jbwncster> You can ask tomorrow
[19:08:25] <MootPoot> Satin: even better
[19:08:27] <Satin> this isn't the first time this school is fucking me over with their beaucracy, i like this school. it's a good school, cheaper, and rigorious but holy shit
[19:08:34] <jbwncster> Fill it out still and email it back
[19:08:43] <Publios> ^
[19:08:46] <jbwncster> Satin: community college
[19:08:51] <Satin> my PTSD from the shooting gets in the way as well from having a calm day
[19:08:53] <Satin> jbwncster: no
[19:09:00] <jbwncster> Worst case is they don‚Äôt do anything with the forms
[19:09:04] <Publios> Satin,  really, don't stress too much. you should be fine. I went through almost the exact situation (just wasn't shot)
[19:09:07] <jbwncster> Best case is you have it filled out
[19:09:42] <Satin> I tried filling out the packet yesterday but apparently part of the form has to be filled out with an academic advisor.
[19:09:53] <HubertFarnsworth> oof Satin,  that's something
[19:09:56] <Satin> It's pretty stupid and simple things like what obstacles you have, and then what solutions you have
[19:10:08] <Satin> and sign it with your advisor or whatever
[19:10:08] <jbwncster> They should call you
[19:10:10] <Satin> drop it off at the dean
[19:10:10] <jbwncster> To let you know
[19:10:18] <Satin> then the dean forwards it to the academic affairs committee
[19:10:20] <Satin> which reviews it
[19:10:37] <jbwncster> I guess schools still want you to fail
[19:10:46] <jbwncster> They aren‚Äôt there to help you succeed
[19:10:46] <Satin> I don't have academic issues, my reasons were very concretely related to just untreated PTSD lmao
[19:11:02] <Publios> that's not true, jbwncster 
[19:11:02] <Satin> jbwncster: well it's the classic good 'ole bureaucracy getting in the way.
[19:11:10] <jbwncster> If you withdrew and didn‚Äôt get grades why are you on suspension?

[19:21:16] <Satin> despite me being a transfer from a community college in another state with 40+ credits on me
[19:21:22] <Roey> Hail Satin!!
[19:21:25] <Satin> so i had to um,,, create one from scratch
[19:21:32] <jbwncster> Homeschooling transcripts count
[19:21:42] <Satin> do I feel unethical a bit? yeah? but was it my fault my parents weren't doing their job? no
[19:21:52] <Satin> and i made sure to make it as close to my actual knowledge as much as possible
[19:22:01] <jbwncster> You know kids can call CPS on their parents?
[19:22:08] <Satin> I know, but the situation is complicated
[19:22:28] <Satin> i already was close to running away from home many times around 2015-15 when i was 15-16 
[19:22:29] <Satin> and so on
[19:22:33] <jbwncster> I ordered the new papa johns pizza
[19:22:39] <Satin> it would actually wreck more havoc on my siblings' psyche

[19:22:46] <Satin> the younger ones especially
[19:22:51] <Satin> if CPS came into the picture
[19:23:05] <Satin> so there's nothing I can really do except hope for the best and keep pressuring my parents to send them to school and stuff
[19:23:09] <jbwncster> Religion ruins things
[19:23:25] <Satin> It can. I'm an agnostic atheist that escaped indoctrination, but I'm not anti-religion.
[19:23:30] <Satin> I'm anti unreasonable religion.
[19:23:34] <Satin> Like my parent's type.

[19:23:56] <HubertFarnsworth> religion ruins
[19:23:58] <HubertFarnsworth> period
[19:23:59] <jbwncster> Evangelical and revival Christianity is a cult
[19:24:11] <Satin> It's just that in my case, my parents are both nutjobs in their own ways (my mom is a trumper, who says God Please Save our President Trump in irl conversations)
[19:24:14] <Satin> HubertFarnsworth: wrong
[19:24:29] <Satin> and that nutjobness is fed/influenced by/validated by the religion they're part of
[19:24:58] <Satin> so my dad can justify his position as this patriarchial authority figure thanks to his twist on the bible and putting himself as God appointed over his wife and kids
[19:25:26] <Satin> HubertFarnsworth: I think it's very important not to be naive about religion's demise in society.
[19:25:45] <MootPoot> ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
[19:25:50] <Satin> HubertFarnsworth: Neitzche, over a hundred years ago realized this with the famous phrase "God is dead, and we have killed him" and that wasn't a triumpanth exclaimation. It was a lamentation.

[19:28:40] <jbwncster> Nope
[19:28:44] <jbwncster> It‚Äôs a new movie
[19:28:53] <HubertFarnsworth> satin, religion's demise? we had religion because we want to know why we are here and what's our purpose..all sorts of philosophical questions. We know the answers now. Religion now is false hope and what not.
[19:28:55] <MootPoot> Satin: I've seen some  people deal with their overly religious parents by out-religion-ing th em
[19:29:17] <MootPoot> study some mroe and then argue about it until they dont want to anymore
[19:29:24] <HubertFarnsworth> anyway, I don't want to get deep into it. I honestly don't care about religion.
[19:29:26] <Satin> MootPoot: Yeah well, I'm not like that.
[19:29:35] <Satin> HubertFarnsworth: But yeah, when you take religion away from society. What replaces it? More consumerism capitalism to fill in the void that we have? Religion is a significant glue of the social fabric in many societies. Hinduism is a way of life in India for example, Shintoism in Japan, and traditionally in western countries like the US and so on.
[19:29:41] <MootPoot> I mean - they aren't beliving in it
[19:29:52] <MootPoot> they just spent a day or two in it to make their parents behave
[19:29:58] <Satin> I don't agree that we "know everything" by any means. Our value systems are fucked in so many ways with religion out of the picture and so on.
[19:30:08] <paine> religion and spirituality are close but not the same
[19:30:12] <paine> there is a distinction
[19:30:25] <Satin> paine: pretty close
[19:30:46] <Satin> paine: nowdays a lot of folks in the US (cough, in this case white girls, cough) have healing stones, are into astrology
[19:30:47] <Satin> and what not
[19:30:51] <HubertFarnsworth> satin, I'm not sure if religion is doing that these days. It's mostly nationalism and common values.
[19:30:53] <Satin> it's not a co-incidence
[19:31:02] <paine> lol i don't considering healing stones and astrology to be spirituality
[19:31:08] <Satin> paine: why not?
[19:31:09] <HubertFarnsworth> satin, and there's also culture

[19:31:19] <paine> astrology is twaddle and has no actual bearing on anything
[19:31:43] <Satin> paine: I don't disagree but it's a major form of spirtuality, similiar to many other belief systems?
[19:31:46] <HubertFarnsworth> but then that's intertwined with religion I guess
[19:31:53] <Satin> what makes astrology less valid spirtuality than those? genuine question lol
[19:32:27] *** Joins: callmepk (~callmepk@wslu/callmepk)
[19:32:28] <Satin> Ancient religions and cultures very much had astrology sort of shit as well connected.
[19:32:42] <paine> i think that astrology is not really spiritual the way that buddhism or other spiritualities are, it's more of a mistaken belief system based on the stars 
[19:32:54] <Satin> The stars were a major source of fortune telling and so on throughout history. I don't think you can dismiss it as a basis for spirituality, with all due respect!
[19:33:19] <paine> yeah but people want to get horoscopes from the stars and assume they have any bearing on their life which is just nonsense
[19:33:26] <Satin> I'm not saying all spirtuality or all religions are created equal the same, but I don't think we should just exclude astrology because it doesn't "feel that great"
[19:33:38] <Satin> and certainly any practioner of those things wouldn't agree with you :P
[19:33:45] <paine> yeah like my mother
[19:33:50] <Satin> heh
[19:33:59] <paine> we don't talk about spirituality or religion :P
[19:34:07] <MootPoot> aliens
[19:34:10] <Cryowolf> Astrology is something highschool and sophmore college girls are into
[19:34:15] <paine> now aliens are something i believe in
[19:34:16] <Cryowolf> and crazy moms
[19:34:18] <Satin> same, my mom is a nut job as i mentioned earlier, who'll start singing or saying in the name of jesus during arguments :P
[19:34:23] <Sadale> MootPoot, damn. Now that I'm thinking if it'd be nice to use RP2040 for my upcoming game console xD
[19:34:32] <Satin> Cryowolf: you'd be surprised at how many people that aren't from those groups are into it as well these days
[19:34:32] <MootPoot> 2040 forever
[19:34:38] <Satin> including men
[19:34:43] <Sadale> MootPoot, It does offer a nice amount of RAM with good price point.
[19:34:53] <Satin> I witness it on social media and sometimes I've encountered them as well in person
[19:35:11] <Sadale> MootPoot, This way I could just load the game from SD card into the RAM and run the game right there
[19:35:13] <Satin> But yeah, back to the main topic that I was arguing for - religion is not some harmful thing inherently. We shouldn't be so naive to dismiss it.
[19:35:16] <Cryowolf> Im sure there's some men genuinly into it, but I'd wager many are only in it to please a girl
[19:35:25] <Sadale> anyway have to sleep rn. :3
[19:35:26] <Satin> Cryowolf: nawh
[19:35:26] *** Joins: aHick (~memes@143.60.229.4)
[19:35:32] <Satin> some are, probs
[19:35:44] <Cryowolf> cause men in general have a more logical approach and distrust astrology
[19:35:44] <Satin> but plenty of others, including those who showed no interest in dating were into that in my experience in college lol
[19:36:00] <Satin> Cryowolf: I politely disagree with that 
[19:36:00] <Cryowolf> we believe in other stupid shit instead
[19:36:01] <paine> i actually think that overall religion has a sort of benefit for society, it helps people abide by a structured set of rules and morals to help guide 
[19:36:06] <Satin> "more logical approach" lmao
[19:36:11] <Cryowolf> that's fine
[19:36:31] <paine> a lot of people are of the belief that agnostic or atheist people are lawless and amoral
[19:36:38] <Satin> paine: that's indeed what I'm getting at. And replacing that is hard.
[19:36:53] <Satin> paine: nihilism, postmodern-darkness enters the picture
[19:37:02] <Cryowolf> well it is true that mens brains are more active in the logic or "science" whatnot area
[19:37:13] <paine> males are illogical
[19:37:15] <Cryowolf> and women more in the emotional, artistic
[19:37:16] <Satin> Cryowolf: women are consistently scoring better grades in logic and science
[19:37:21] <Satin> in school these days
[19:37:23] <Satin> this is hard data
[19:37:30] <Satin> I think your belief in those stereotypes is outdated
[19:37:34] <jbwncster> I also like sports themed anime and shojo
[19:37:42] <Publios> look what agnosticism and atheism brings about! loli lovers !

[19:37:55] *** Quits: MikeEcho (~IceChat95@17-77-178-143.ftth.glasoperator.nl) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[19:37:59] <Cryowolf> not really. I have a speculation on why women are scoring better. It's cause men just stopped caring
[19:38:11] <Satin> Sure. That's just reasoning things away.
[19:38:26] <paine> or perhaps it's because they're actually including women in the statistics now
[19:38:28] <Cryowolf> nobody is pushing men to accomplish stuff anymore while women have been very very encouraged
[19:38:30] <Satin> Not to mention that the line of reasoning you're citing is *very* heavily debated  (brain development)
[19:38:32] <paine> and women are participating more in STEM programs
[19:38:32] <Satin> paine: that too.
[19:38:33] <paine> etc
[19:38:36] <HubertFarnsworth> why are you people generalizing males and females?
[19:38:40] <jbwncster> Women are smarter than men
[19:38:41] <Satin> HubertFarnsworth: that's what I'm saying
[19:38:44] <HubertFarnsworth> heh
[19:38:48] <Satin> jbwncster: I wouldn't say that either, even if I'm a woman :P
[19:38:57] <paine> well idk how smart anything is that procreates
[19:38:58] <HubertFarnsworth> this is why irc is bad Satin 
[19:38:58] <Jigsy> [16:08:40] <jbwncster> Women are smarter than men
[19:39:00] <paine> ovaries are pretty dumb
[19:39:01] <Jigsy> Depends on the country.
[19:39:07] <Cryowolf> jbwncster, I disagree. Our intelligence differs
[19:39:07] <Satin> Jigsy: not in the UK, huh?
[19:39:08] <Satin> XD
[19:39:08] <Jigsy> Brits are dumb regardless of their gender. ::P
[19:39:12] <Jigsy> :P *
[19:39:12] <Cryowolf> because we're individuals
[19:39:17] <jbwncster> Satin: women often pick dumb men as mates and perpetuate the low iq
[19:39:44] <Satin> Cryowolf is citing rather outdated and heavily heavily debated ideas in brain development/evolutionary psychology
[19:40:02] <Satin> and as we keep talking about in this channel every few days, *anytime* someone starts citing evolutionary psychology
[19:40:20] <Satin> it's generally fraught with issues and a minefield, i don't think there's any established consensus for that sort of belief at this time.
[19:40:26] <Cryowolf> Satin, it's not reasoning away to say the truth that there has been a shitload of programs and so on encouraging women to pursue a career in stem etc while a lot of stuff has been telling men to "make room" and so on.
[19:40:30] <MootPoot> is evolutionary psychology responsible for me liking anime
[19:40:33] <Cryowolf> These are things that happened
[19:40:48] <paine> that's because for many years "females" were excluded
[19:41:04] <paine> and even now females aren't even allowed to be female anymore, they are "assigned female at birth" or something
[19:41:06] <Cryowolf> it's great that more women have the confidence and courage to pursue more careers
[19:41:09] <jbwncster> MootPoot: are you a NEET?
[19:41:11] <Satin> Cryowolf: I don't disagree that might be a strong factor. I'm just saying this in response to your earlier claim of "male brains are more logical, female brains are more emotional and artistic"
[19:41:17] <paine> it's great that society is allowing women to pursue more careers*
[19:41:24] <MootPoot> am I a NEET?
[19:41:27] <Satin> that's a very extraordinary claim fraught with issues
[19:41:29] <paine> outside of being just homemakers, accountants and babysitters
[19:41:45] <Satin> it's not that the notion doesn't exist, it's that it's controversial and there's no consensus on that.
[19:41:50] <Cryowolf> Satin, okay. I still think that's true. But poorly worded on my part
[19:41:57] <jbwncster> MootPoot: The definition of NEET was created to define the generation from 15 to 34 years old that do not wish to work. How did this happen and what does the government do to solve this problem? NEET ‚Äì short for ‚ÄòNot in Education, Employment or Training‚Äô and is used to describe people who are lazy/do not want to work.
[19:42:03] <Cryowolf> men are on average less neurotic
[19:42:19] <MootPoot> I guess I'm a half neet then
[19:42:30] <jbwncster> Cryowolf: you try to deal with a bleeding body part once a month with raging hormones
[19:42:33] <paine> can you blame women for being neurotic when men say shit like, 'men are on average less neurotic'
[19:42:33] <MootPoot> either a 'ne' or a 'et'
[19:42:35] <Satin> Cryowolf: see, that claim that you just said about neuroticism is far more backable on the other hand.
[19:42:54] <Satin> You're right about that one last I checked.
[19:43:01] <DaPinkOne> MootPoot, do you do NEET things?
[19:43:04] <Cryowolf> Satin, that is what I was trying to say but I ended up screwing it up
[19:43:14] <MootPoot> DaPinkOne: what are NEET things
[19:43:16] <Satin> haha, I think those are very different claims but hey, fair enough. Gotcha.
[19:43:33] <DaPinkOne> MootPoot, have you seen Welcome to the NHK?
[19:43:37] <Satin> Cryowolf: And to add to that, higher neuroticism has been found to have an effect on grades in school as well for sure
[19:43:38] *** Quits: callmepk (~callmepk@wslu/callmepk) (Quit: Computer sleeping)
[19:43:39] <MootPoot> yes
[19:43:41] <Cryowolf> Perhaps...but less neuroticism makes room for more logic
[19:43:43] <Satin> (not in a healthy way of course)
[19:43:46] <DaPinkOne> he does NEET things
[19:43:50] <jbwncster> Satin: when your hormones are out of whack because of the gift from Mother Nature it‚Äôs not your fault
[19:44:18] <Satin> Cryowolf: The complexity of interactions between the 5 traits is complicated as hell.
[19:44:30] <Cryowolf> Satin, in Sweden, what has been called the most "equal" society on earth. Men and women perform about the same and there's nothing keeping anyone out
[19:44:31] <Satin> Openness, which is linked to more creative/abstract stuff
[19:44:35] <Satin> neuroticness and so on....
[19:44:45] <Cryowolf> I'm a fairly neurotic male
[19:44:47] * Satin is high in O and also high in N
[19:44:56] * Satin is also lower in C :( and high in A.
[19:45:00] <DaPinkOne> "openness", "neuroticness", .... are we talking about nazi-era personality quizes?
[19:45:01] * MootPoot is high in DN
[19:45:07] <Cryowolf> I'm extremely creative, my imagination is insane
[19:45:14] <MootPoot> DaPinkOne: JP vibes
[19:45:28] <Cryowolf> and if I may stroke my ego more, I'm very talented at coming up with stuff and problem solving
[19:45:31] <Satin> DaPinkOne: No. It's related to the big 5 personality test. Which measures 5 traits in raw scores and establishes correlations based on that stuff.
[19:45:31] * MootPoot turns Satin into a lipstick wearing lobster
[19:45:42] <Cryowolf> but I'm rather neurotic sometimes
[19:45:55] <Satin> DaPinkOne: Out of all the flood of personality test bullshit out there, this is the only one that's actually used in scientific studies of personality and has consistent correlations.
[19:46:09] <Cryowolf> Satin, correct
[19:46:12] <jbwncster> Satin: I don‚Äôt trust the meyers Briggs thing
[19:46:20] <Satin> That doesn't mean it can explain everything, and any individual taking it it in an unprofessional setting, or tryign to interpret it on their own
[19:46:27] <Satin> needs a HUGE warning about what they're trying to do
[19:46:50] <Satin> People who actually study the stuff and know the nuances are far more reliable than people who read pop-descriptions of the traits and reach conclusions about it.
[19:46:55] <Cryowolf> the meyer briggs thing is very generalized. It may be correct but that's like saying "You're currently in China/Russia/Europe/Americas" but it doesn't say where
[19:46:56] <Satin> jbwncster: Yes. The MBTI is garbage.
[19:46:59] <MootPoot> there has to be a reason why these "how its made videos are so addicting"
[19:47:04] <Cryowolf> it's such a huge area
[19:47:11] <Satin> jbwncster: it's not that it's based on *nothing*, it's based on jung's stuff and what not, but it's so stupid
[19:47:15] <jbwncster> I also don‚Äôt trust the Kinsey scale
[19:47:18] <Satin> it's on the same level of horoscopes really
[19:47:28] <Satin> give some answers, get out a personality type
[19:47:41] <Satin> and then people read the description of MBTI personality types, e.g. i'm ISTP
[19:47:43] <Cryowolf> Wasn't the Kinsey scale created for criminals?
[19:47:46] <Satin> or people who are INTP jack themselves off to that
[19:47:46] <Cryowolf> in prison
[19:47:49] <jbwncster> Satin: are you a Capricorn?
[19:47:51] <Satin> but it's all garbage
[19:47:54] <Satin> jbwncster: scorpio XD
[19:47:59] <jbwncster> Close enough
[19:48:12] <jbwncster> What‚Äôs your Chinese zodiac?
[19:48:17] <Cryowolf> I'm also INTP, I don't know how that will ever help me in life so who gives a shit
[19:48:43] <Satin> XD
[19:48:48] <Satin> when websites tell you
[19:48:48] <Cryowolf> I am the OX
[19:48:54] <Cryowolf> Chinese Zodiac
[19:48:57] <jbwncster> I‚Äôm a rat

[19:49:03] <Satin> "you're INTP, you're only so and such % of the population"
[19:49:06] <jbwncster> Or snake I forget
[19:49:12] <jbwncster> Publios: you were just born?

[19:50:12] <Cryowolf> and the women performing better thing is focused on the US right?
[19:50:24] <Poeticode> I like the enneagram personality test thingy. Much more helpful imo
[19:50:25] <Satin> I think that was across the world, especially developing countries
[19:50:36] <Satin> but the link i linked probably was focused on the US
[19:50:40] <Cryowolf> which has been rather sociopolitically turbulent the past 7-8 years or more
[19:50:45] <jbwncster> Cryowolf: women get paid less here
[19:50:52] <Cryowolf> no they don't
[19:50:53] <Publios> chobits is a bit disturbing
[19:50:59] <jbwncster> They did
[19:51:04] <Cryowolf> that's a falsely presented statistic
[19:51:12] <DaPinkOne> Publios, it is pretty disturbing
[19:51:22] <jbwncster> Women don‚Äôt get promotions like men
[19:51:35] <Publios> ive been reading it on and off for a few years
[19:51:40] <Satin> I mostly agree with jbwncster, but would be cautious for sure with this whole debate
[19:51:42] <Satin> on this*
[19:51:45] <Publios> seems weirder than ever as I get close to the end
[19:51:50] <Cryowolf> You can't take every job, every person, all their salaries, add it together and then divide it by the amount and say "look men make more"
[19:51:53] <jbwncster> Walmart told many women they can‚Äôt get a promotion because they have to stay home to make babies
[19:51:59] <Satin> but in any case, I need to be productive with my pomodoros, slap on some sunscreen and workout!

[19:52:45] <jbwncster> Cryowolf: I‚Äôll cut a bitch
[19:52:51] <Cryowolf> you need to be aggressive (appropriately so) in negotiations
[19:52:51] <DaPinkOne> Cryowolf, even if it is "choosing career", that points to a failure of the system to provide basic, reasonable benefits like maternity leave, and possibly discrimination
[19:53:34] <Cryowolf> DaPinkOne, people should be free to choose what they want. Not what activists need them to choose so they can get a better statistic
[19:53:37] <jbwncster> Most hourly jobs in usa have no paid leave
[19:53:45] *** Joins: lucerne (~lucerne@ip202.ip-51-178-215.eu)
[19:53:48] <DaPinkOne> women are seen substancially less favorably when they're aggressive.
[19:53:50] <Satin> I think the mistake of a lot of people during discussions like these is assuming discrimination is done in an outright, very blatant manner. 
[19:54:23] <Cryowolf> jbwncster, I can't speak for the USA a lot, for one I don't live there...Secondly, it depends on your state
[19:54:55] <jbwncster> No I‚Äôve never seen an hourly retail/fast food position with paid leave or sick days
[19:55:12] <Satin> Like with racism, people will often associate racism with outright discrimination, but often the people who are trying to make it go away have different definitions for racism. Statistical disparity can be caused by more "abstract" causes such as say, institutional racism, cultural racism, or subtle but important policies and who's making the policies that impact how laws are enforced and which demographic it has an impact on.
[19:55:16] <Cryowolf> that's cause hourly don't get that
[19:55:40] <DaPinkOne> Cryowolf, in many countries they do.
[19:55:41] <jbwncster> Satin: people who often want to erase racism are racist and biased
[19:55:55] <jbwncster> I know a lot of black people who hate white people just because they‚Äôre white
[19:55:56] <Satin> Similarly, people assume with something like the gender gap that it is an either or situation, and that either it is blatantly people saying "no" to women or something. When often there's complicated or abstract causes, but the data is clearly there.
[19:56:09] <Cryowolf> Satin, I'm sure the US has remnants of the very racist system or society it was until the 60s
[19:56:18] <Cryowolf> when it started moving in the right direction
[19:56:20] <Satin> So the gender pay gap undeniably exists, from all the statistics we have established, even in industries where men and women both are in. We just don't know why.
[19:56:39] <jbwncster> I saw a video of a black woman telling white people to leave the multicultural center at a university
[19:56:43] <Cryowolf> Satin, it sits around 5% though iirc

[19:56:48] <ImoutoBot> [youtube] Is the Gender Pay Gap Real? | Duration: 5 minutes, 58 seconds
[19:57:05] <Cryowolf> not around the high number that's falsely presented
[19:57:06] <jbwncster> Satin: it‚Äôs real enough we needed a law about it
[19:57:08] <Satin> I just think that people need to stop treating this in reductive terms or black and white stuff.
[19:57:19] <Cryowolf> I hate when people use statistics to skew it to fit their agenda
[19:57:21] <MootPoot> afaik the gender pay gap...is real or is not real - they changed the definition of what it means like 3 times
[19:57:34] <Satin> MootPoot: It's an established statistical disparity.
[19:57:42] <Satin> We don't know the reasons why.
[19:57:45] <Cryowolf> I know the gender pay gap as originally presented by activists, is false
[19:57:54] <MootPoot> before it was equal pay for equal work - and now its turned into women and men must make the same amount of money as a group
[19:57:59] <Cryowolf> I know that there is one however, but it's closer to 5% than 20%
[19:58:14] <Satin> I really doubt it is something as simple-minded as men saying "no" to raises from women or whatever. That might be certainly part of it, and workplace culture, but there's many other causes too.
[19:58:26] <Satin> Instead of dismissing such things, we should be working to eliminate them and address them
[19:58:32] <Cryowolf> MootPoot, it has moved towards equity and that's dangerous cause it makes people less motivated to work
[19:58:40] <Satin> not thinking in terms of reductive, either it happened blatantly, or didn't hhappen blatantly.
[19:59:02] <jbwncster> Cryowolf: not really
[19:59:02] <MootPoot> but its interesting how quickly it shifted from definition 1 to definition 2
[19:59:05] <MootPoot> without anybody knowing 
[19:59:13] <Satin> Cryowolf: I don't know about "equity" having anything to do with motivation to work. Care to elaborate?
[19:59:15] <MootPoot> or well - being publically announced
[19:59:32] <Cryowolf> Satin, I think that since women that are more aggressive in negotiations and so on, are often promoted. So teach women to be more aggressive, more go getter
[19:59:46] <Poeticode> if men could get pregnant maybe it would be more even
[19:59:47] <jbwncster> This new girl at my old job got paid more because she was pregnant
[19:59:50] <jbwncster> Like wtf
[20:00:00] <MootPoot> people are brought onboard with the equal pay for equal work phrasing, and then lo and behold at some point it becomes equal overall income for both genders
[20:00:18] <Cryowolf> Satin, because in equity you are paid the same regardless of the amount of work or quality of work you put in. Since there's no promotion or negotiation for individual pay raises, why bother?
[20:00:37] <Poeticode> hm that's a new one jbwncster :0 I've only heard of women not getting hired because maternity leave was almost certain to be needed
[20:00:40] <Cryowolf> you end up doing the bare minimum
[20:00:41] <Jigsy> I SURE hoPe yoU DOn'T diSCuss YoUR WaGes wITh oThER WORKERs.
[20:01:07] <jbwncster> Cryowolf: I would say that would be nice to do if usa had better social welfare
[20:01:11] <Satin> Cryowolf: I don't know if the answer is making people more aggressive. Is that really *supposed* to be the way things are? lol
[20:01:15] <Cryowolf> Poeticode, that can be solved by doing what Sweden did...Just make it "parental leave", that is shared
[20:01:16] <Poeticode> it would make the owners - oops i mean your fellow coworkers feel awkward if you did that Jigsy
[20:01:20] <Satin> jbwncster: yeah social safety nets are SEVERLY lacking in this country.
[20:01:22] <jbwncster> Jigsy: I got yelled at for saying I got a raise after 60 days
[20:01:24] <MootPoot> anyway - I'm not totally on board with the new recategorization 
[20:01:40] <jbwncster> To  coworker
[20:01:43] <Satin> Jigsy: governments that aren't american reveal their wages often in other countries or whatever
[20:01:48] <Satin> government employers*
[20:01:51] <Satin> er
[20:01:54] <Satin> even american gov does that ig
[20:02:12] <Cryowolf> Satin, yes it is. I wouldn't want to promote someone that comes off as insecure and afraid to speak up or go after the job. I would question their motivation and ambition
[20:02:12] <MootPoot> now show their stock trades in real time Satin 
[20:02:16] <Satin> MootPoot: if you study any of this stuff or give it a closer look, often it is complicated. there's no one definition for it
[20:02:19] <jbwncster> Satin: I worked in retail and got yelled at for saying I made 50¬¢ more than when I started
[20:02:34] <jbwncster> In the break room to a coworker
[20:02:35] <Satin> Cryowolf:  you don't need to be aggressive in order to not be insecure.
[20:02:53] <Satin> Cryowolf: in fact part of not being insecure is being able to be a people person and know how to talk to people without being aggressive
[20:02:57] <MootPoot> Satin: I have looked into it a little - I'm  not saying I know the reasons WHY women as a group make less - all I'm saying is that I'm for equal pay for equal work , not for equal overall income for different groups]
[20:02:59] <Cryowolf> aggressive doesn't refer to anything physical or hostile
[20:03:06] <DaPinkOne> how did y'all segue from discussion of personality/psychology into "pay inequality isn't real"? that's some major shifting of goal posts
[20:03:12] <Satin> Cryowolf: I know
[20:03:26] <jbwncster> Why does pizza cost so much now?
[20:03:35] <jbwncster> $18 for 1 medium pizza
[20:03:40] <DaPinkOne> jbwncster, 'cause you'll buy it won't ya?
[20:03:42] <Satin> DaPinkOne:  It's not shifting of the goal posts. The topic shifted, kind of unavoidably.
[20:03:47] <paine> supply chain issues
[20:03:57] <Cryowolf> DaPinkOne, I'm not in this for goal posts. I don't care what people end up believing, thinking or wanting at the end of the day. I'll treat them based on their individual persnality
[20:04:09] <jbwncster> paine: no that‚Äôs bullshit
[20:04:28] <paine> i know in canada they're planning on increasing prices 
[20:04:28] <Cryowolf> perhaps that's a very Swedish thing to do, since social and economical classes have mixed here for ages. It's a taboo to discuss your income or money
[20:04:30] <Satin> If you're in here regularly, you'll notice Cryowolf 's views are a tad bit conservative compared relatively to the rest of us, and as soon as he mentioned brain differences between male and female, I kind of guessed that the gender pay gap would eventualyl become a topic
[20:04:33] <DaPinkOne> there are actually supply chain issues
[20:04:45] <paine> the powers that be who run the groceries are planning on increasing prices in 2022
[20:04:56] <Satin> not that I have any problem with that, cryo's far more sensible to argue with than many others who might share their views lmao
[20:04:58] <paine> so everything basic will be going up... milk, bread, eggs, etc
[20:05:03] <paine> that will impact stuff like pizza
[20:05:06] <Cryowolf> Satin, I'm not denying the pay gap, I'm saying that many popular sources have incorrectly reported on the statistics
[20:05:18] <MootPoot> anime
[20:05:28] <Satin> Cryowolf: I semi-agree with that, but that's a good distinction to make, thanks for the clarification
[20:05:45] <DaPinkOne> there are actually two supply chains: one for grocery, and one for wholesalers like restaraunts. suddently a lot of people are staying home and cooking themselves, and the supply chains haven't caught up with the shock
[20:05:52] <MootPoot> Satin: my old prof told me the assignment I hated the most was designed like that on purpose

[20:06:07] <Cryowolf> and now they'll distrust you
[20:06:21] <Cryowolf> and anything accurate you report might be believed to be a lie
[20:06:40] <Satin> Cryowolf: FWIW, I despise popular reporting on many social-justice esque topics along with my laundry list of issues with popular media reporting in general.
[20:06:44] <Cryowolf> wanting clicks and money was a contributing factor to skewing statistics
[20:07:08] <MootPoot> Satin: I had to make a sceduling and score tracking system for a golf course
[20:07:10] <MootPoot> I know nothing about gold
[20:07:15] <MootPoot> I know nothing about golf*
[20:07:17] <Satin> I worry more about the actual researchers/intellectuals in the field and what claims they make.
[20:07:21] <MootPoot> and now I just hate golf
[20:07:29] <DaPinkOne> MootPoot, it's that bad?
[20:07:32] <Vohveli> 90% of people in prison are men, to fix this glaring disparity (obviously caused by a misandrist justice system) I propose we either put more women in prison or release some of the men

[20:07:51] <Satin> Vohveli: let's throw all the weebs in there
[20:07:52] <jbwncster> And cricket is the worst sport ever
[20:07:54] <MootPoot> Vohveli: we should aim to imprrison more women
[20:08:06] <DaPinkOne> Vohveli, we could just abolish prison for non-violent crimes
[20:08:10] <MootPoot> Satin: if you think about it the weebs are already in self-imposed prison
[20:08:12] <MootPoot> you dont really need to
[20:08:13] <Cryowolf> if you want to check the pay gap, you need to categorize it into the different sectors, positions, geographical location, age, time of employment, hours put into the job, job performance, peer reviews etc
[20:08:16] <Satin> I grew up half living in India. Cricket is a fun sport. I do not understand baseball.
[20:08:17] <jbwncster> A lot of women get away with crimes just because they‚Äôre female
[20:08:30] <Satin> I don't understand American football either, but I'm from a city that has a lot of recent superbowl winners, so I'm trying to understand it!
[20:08:32] <Cryowolf> if you generalize it too much, you can make anything souond true
[20:08:35] <jbwncster> Satin: there‚Äôs a cricket team in my state

[20:09:09] <DaPinkOne> Satin, the games aren't that complicated really, but baseball's kindof boring imo

[20:12:42] <jbwncster> Vohveli: I just blame it all on the republicans
[20:12:52] <Satin> Vohveli: Some major ones def are.
[20:13:01] <paine> americans are to blame for the current state of the world
[20:13:04] <Satin> Vohveli: but this is also a very American thing. You Europeans don't really deal with this the same way
[20:13:06] <MootPoot> I heard about that one keyboard which lets you achieve like 500wpm

[20:13:13] <MootPoot> but it costs like 1500

[20:15:40] <Cryowolf> I'm also someone that is against mass immigration, but in favor of controlled, moderate and properly done immigration. Mass immigration has created parallel societies in Sweden where nobody speaks Swedish, there are stores where they don't speak Swedish. They have underground sharia law courts. Stuff a lot of people came here to escape, is now where the government threw them and then forgot about them. Our government was too busy 
[20:15:40] <Cryowolf> wanting to "look good", that they forgot they also had to have a system in place that works for assimilation and integration. To make the language and social studies of Sweden mandatory. To make looking for a job mandatory. To better vet those who want to come in, because we've let in A LOT of terrorists and criminal organizations. They're not related, but bad
[20:15:41] <DaPinkOne> jbwncster, I like my browns just fine, and my second keyboard has reds. I like it's feel better, but it's too hard to use 'cause it's too small
[20:15:51] <DaPinkOne> ye olde walle o' text
[20:15:55] <Cryowolf> but because I'm against mass immigration, people assume I'm racist
[20:16:01] <jbwncster> DaPinkOne: I just use a wireless Logitech right now
[20:16:08] <MootPoot> I mean the thing with the "mass immigration" is , what exactly IS "mass immigration"
[20:16:14] <MootPoot> at what point is it 'mass;
[20:16:18] <jbwncster> I don‚Äôt mind immigration
[20:16:38] <Satin> Cryowolf: The problem is a lot of people who have the same position as you, on the surface level, are often racist. I've met nazi/racist swedes on Discord aplenty or people who are reactionary and want them absolutely out, and think they're tainting the gene pool of white swedes.
[20:16:38] <Cryowolf> when you don't have the resources or infrastructure to handle the immigration
[20:16:40] <jbwncster> I wish I could get asylum in Europe cause my state is very backwards
[20:16:50] <Satin> Cryowolf: So taht's context for why people might jump to conclusions about your position
[20:17:09] <Satin> Cryowolf: but I actually appreciate what you said above seems to be on a more reasonable basis and not for those kind of reasons, I generally actually agree with you
[20:17:16] <Cryowolf> I think that's a very American perspective though

[20:17:41] <MootPoot> and making so many mistake
[20:17:43] <MootPoot> s
[20:17:54] <Satin> But yeah, assimilation is def important
[20:18:02] <Cryowolf> the reason we have a lot of explosive attacks now, a ton of grenade attacks. Is because we didn't vet them
[20:18:04] <Satin> and just letting people in without a plan or whatever, is pretty stupid
[20:18:11] <Cryowolf> so now criminal gangs are at war
[20:18:17] <MootPoot> I think there is more to it then that
[20:18:18] <Satin> Yeah. Societal issues.
[20:18:20] <Cryowolf> and us regular folks are caught in it
[20:18:28] <Cryowolf> if they had just said "fuck off, we dont want you"
[20:18:28] <MootPoot> I think criminality is created from lack of legal oppourtinities 
[20:18:32] <Cryowolf> this would happen less
[20:18:35] <jbwncster> I wanna move to Sweden
[20:18:47] <Satin> vetting people is absolutely important
[20:19:19] <darkwitch> jbwncster, you want to move to sweden and join one of the gangs?
[20:19:51] <Cryowolf> when there is a lack of integration and assimilation, when there are no requirements such as learning the language and learning about the law in Sweden, our history, tradition, values etc (not because you have to follow our traditions, but they create a valuable context) and when you don't even need to look for a job for the rest of your life cause you'll be on the dole
[20:19:59] <MootPoot> I dont think - generally speakign that most poeple will choose that by default
[20:20:05] <Cryowolf> that creates a bad situation
[20:20:07] <paine> they put you on welfare?
[20:20:22] <Satin> Cryowolf: agreed
[20:20:36] <paine> here when they immigrate asylum seekers and they're settled they aren't allowed to be on welfare, they're given passports and the right to work
[20:20:40] <Cryowolf> when you don't spread immigrants out and into the Swedish population to encourage integration and rather just say "Look at that area over there, let's put ALL OF THEM there"
[20:20:42] <paine> they aren't supposed to sit on welfare
[20:20:58] <MootPoot> Cryowolf: afaik singapore does a good job of that
[20:21:00] <paine> but we still see subsects of population up where they haven't integrated at all
[20:21:19] <MootPoot> they mandate that certain places are structures in a way that its impossible to have like ethinic groups
[20:21:21] <Cryowolf> paine, they can remain on welfare for their entire life because we currently have no law that requires they look for and accept any job offered
[20:21:32] <MootPoot> everyone is forced to live alongside their other race neighbours in a certain ratio
[20:21:47] <paine> that's terrible, there should be laws against that
[20:22:02] <paine> we try to assimilate people here and get them involved into the community and find them work but it's not perfect
[20:22:22] <Cryowolf> Satin, see...when you actually talk to me about these opinions. They end up surprisingly rational, pragmatic and reasonable. To the point where you even agree
[20:22:33] <Satin> I can agree with you on this topic :P
[20:22:35] <Poeticode> i wish they would assimilate me i want more friends
[20:22:42] <Cryowolf> you agreed on neuroticism too
[20:22:49] <Cryowolf> and skewing statistics
[20:23:05] <Satin> I don't agree on the gender pay gap thing, except with the reporting part, but I have my reasons.
[20:23:17] <Satin> Neuroticism - yeah, I've researched the big 5 a bunch before.
[20:23:26] <Satin> It is established that women are more neurotic for whatever reason on average than men
[20:23:34] <Cryowolf> I didn't deny there is one. I denied its size isn't what is misreported
[20:24:00] <Cryowolf> big diff
[20:24:08] <paine> Poeticode you should check out your local community centre and see if they do social events or anything like that
[20:24:22] <paine> here the libraries host groups and the like for adults so you can have some social interaction
[20:24:32] <Satin> I think a lot of people don't even look at the size of what's reported and think in very black and white terms about it, unfortunately, either it does or doesn't happen
[20:24:47] <Satin> and often a lot of people are willing to deny its very existence in the first place, or that's an issue at all which is what i disagree with
[20:24:59] <Satin> I am critical for sure about how the media reports this stuff though, so you're probably right about the reporting bit
[20:25:03] <MootPoot> Cryowolf: for some addtional context when you mention mass immigration - I can give the example of the brexit retoric in the UK - they used political advertisements with a column of brown / african refugees as a background picture with regards to saying "no to mass immigration" - but the biggest immigrant group the  UK were the polish which were white at the time
[20:25:06] <Poeticode> sounds like a better idea than going to bars paine
[20:25:12] <Cryowolf> what causes the wage gap though can be debated. But you have to keep something in mind. The positions of power at big companies and in politics are held by the relics of past generations that believed different things
[20:25:22] <MootPoot> so you see why mentioning mass immigration immediately makes racist red flags stand up
[20:25:23] <Satin> yeah
[20:25:36] <Cryowolf> So of course the top of the top will be very different and cause a statistical skew
[20:25:42] <Satin> MootPoot: that's something I tried to explain earlier too
[20:25:54] <MootPoot> Satin: yeah I read that - was just adding a real life example
[20:25:55] <Satin> MootPoot: I also hate not having nuanced conversations about this though in popular discourse
[20:26:06] <Satin> sad that the overton window or w/e's shifted so sharply
[20:26:10] <MootPoot> as to why the red flags go up
[20:26:14] <Satin> ah 
[20:26:41] <paine> Poeticode people only go to bars to get drunk and hook up, i don't think you'd establish proper social connections there
[20:26:44] <paine> at least that's my experience
[20:26:58] <Satin> MootPoot: one of my most controversial positions is that I don't think every country has to be multiracial even
[20:27:06] <Cryowolf> MootPoot, okay. I struggle to remain rational because I live in a neighborhood that has become a parallel society and there's Arab founded gangs at war with Turks or Iranians
[20:27:10] <paine> "cultural mosaic"
[20:27:12] <Satin> some countries, like mine, were built on those principles and *should be*
[20:27:17] <Poeticode> who needs nuanced discussion when a dope tagline and a very polarizing character from the other side (reducing it to two sides) evokes the emotions they want and gets the views
[20:27:19] <MootPoot> people think that every country has to be?
[20:27:30] <Satin> MootPoot: people accuse Japan of xenophobia often
[20:27:32] <Cryowolf> but it was the governments fault, they had no system in place
[20:27:41] <Satin> MootPoot: and to some extent, yes, they def are. and they're racist too which is absolutely bad
[20:27:53] <Satin> but then the basis sometimes is japanese closedness to immigration and that's apparently racist
[20:27:59] <Satin> like idk about that bit being true
[20:28:03] <Cryowolf> It's not the average law abiding normal immigrant or asylum seekers fault that criminals got in and corrupted the youth
[20:28:13] <Satin> (ofc immigration being closed is fucking them over, their demographics are in sharp decline)
[20:28:35] <MootPoot> I mean - I dont think its a big deal if country is not super multiracial but at the same time I dont think I would "actively" promote any country  being multiracial or not multiracial
[20:28:39] <MootPoot> the entire concept seems cringe
[20:28:44] <Satin> yeah
[20:28:51] <MootPoot> I'd just allow immigration as needed, and what happens, happens
[20:28:53] <Satin> i mean it's not so cringe in countries like the US
[20:28:54] <MootPoot> thats it
[20:29:03] <Satin> where we're actively dealing with race history hostilities and tensions
[20:29:06] <paine> but america hates immigrants
[20:29:06] <Satin> it *needs* to be promoted here
[20:29:10] <Satin> but elsewhere? idk man
[20:29:15] <Cryowolf> Sweden should close or heavily restrict immigration until we have a strong, sturdy, working and complete system with redundancies in place. Until we can give the proper care and education to those who've already come here so they don't need to be on the dole for life
[20:29:17] <MootPoot> Satin: I mean with regards to fresh immigrants
[20:29:26] <Satin> MootPoot: oh right, yeah
[20:29:26] <DaPinkOne> paine, america hates non-whites and poor people
[20:29:26] <MootPoot> not with historcal things like with the african americans
[20:29:31] *** Joins: cosmicjoker (~cosmicjok@user/cosmic)
[20:29:36] <Cryowolf> once that is taken care of, once we fullfill our responsibility. We can open again
[20:29:44] <Satin> Cryowolf: yeah
[20:29:46] <Cryowolf> and now with a working system
[20:29:55] <Cryowolf> is that such a racist thing to think?
[20:29:57] <Satin> Cryowolf: is the swedish economy benefitting in any way in general from this?
[20:30:02] <Satin> i'm sure the crime rates have taken a hit 
[20:30:05] <Cryowolf> no, we're at a net loss
[20:30:06] <paine> and they have an irrational hatred of their superior neighbours in the great frozen north
[20:30:09] <Satin> uptick*
[20:30:19] <Cryowolf> violent crime is up, petty crime is down
[20:30:24] <Satin> Cryowolf: you'd think more young immigrants would start working yeah?
[20:30:29] <Satin> and contribute to the swedish economy
[20:30:40] <Cryowolf> Satin, no cause in parallel societies they are manipulated and groomed by gangs
[20:30:47] <Satin> yikes
[20:31:06] <Cryowolf> since police often can't even enter, not ambulances or firefighters either. They get attacked
[20:31:07] <DaPinkOne> paine, lets not jump to conclusions here. the state hates the poor, but only some americans dislike canadians.
[20:31:11] <MootPoot> afaik a big thing is also the fact that countries dont like to aknowledge the degrees/education from another country , especially a not so similar one
[20:31:25] <Cryowolf> to clarify, they aren't attacked by the average person/immigrant
[20:31:27] <Satin> paine: yeah idk most people are neutral about canada
[20:31:31] <Cryowolf> they're attacked by the fucking gangs
[20:31:36] <darkwitch> japan is not exactly racist. it's more about _anyone_ who's not completely japanese than about what their actual race is
[20:31:43] <MootPoot> so you have a absolotely retarded scenario where people who are PHDs and masters etc in their own countries have to work as taxi drivers in the countries they move to
[20:31:45] <Satin> paine: in recent years they'll make a big deal about some gender bill that was brought to attention by jordan peterson, but that's it.
[20:31:45] <MootPoot> which is bullshit
[20:32:03] <MootPoot> Satin: we have this problem with covid and ER beds here - 
[20:32:08] <Satin> darkwitch: not true, halpas or whatever have a different story to tell about that bit
[20:32:20] <darkwitch> even being half japanese is suspicious
[20:32:23] <Satin> darkwitch: there's a bunch of parties in japan that literally run off racism 
[20:32:32] <Satin> they're not prominent ofc
[20:32:36] <DaPinkOne> darkwitch, that sounds pretty racist to me
[20:32:41] <Satin> but they go around with loudspeakers saying shit about korean and what not
[20:32:42] <Cryowolf> in Sweden if you have a phd or something and come here, you're offered to take our university tests, theoretical and practical
[20:32:50] <Cryowolf> to prove you're knowledgeable
[20:32:51] <MootPoot> people are complaining about the ER not being extended which we cant do becasue we dont have the staff and we refuse to accelerate new doctor ER training ( for good reason ) but also then refuse to aknowledge overseas medical licences 
[20:32:56] <darkwitch> DaPinkOne, is there a japanese "race"?
[20:32:58] <Cryowolf> this especially goes for doctors or nurses
[20:33:00] <Satin> Cryowolf: nice
[20:33:01] <DaPinkOne> there's also the whole "ww2 warcriminals were never tried, and went free" thing
[20:33:01] <paine> it's because america is considered the educational standard
[20:33:16] <DaPinkOne> darkwitch, as much as there is a white race, I would say
[20:33:18] <Cryowolf> and I can't see why it's controversial
[20:33:29] <Cryowolf> to want someone to prove they can what they claim
[20:33:29] <Satin> MootPoot: lol
[20:33:32] <darkwitch> maybe I mostly just disagree about the definition of racism
[20:33:43] <ButterNoodle> racing is against the law go to jail
[20:33:57] <paine> the definition of racism has changed since i was a kid
[20:34:04] <Satin> paine: and for good reason
[20:34:05] <MootPoot> Satin: like, I'm sure a guy who learned medicine in idk, turkey might not be trained as well as one who learned here but we need more doctors and I'm sure he does a fine job
[20:34:22] <Satin> like i said earlier, racism def operates in more complicated ways than just "oh look, black man. i won't give him a job"
[20:34:24] <DaPinkOne> darkwitch, a "race" is a grab-bag of phenotypes a group of people have(or don't have) in common. racism: discrimination based on displayed phenotypes
[20:34:31] <DaPinkOne> of the "race"
[20:34:42] <Cryowolf> One thing I really don't like is how they say "you can't be racist to white people"
[20:34:44] <Satin> MootPoot: true
[20:34:49] <Satin> MootPoot: i think the US is better about that?
[20:35:09] <Satin> Cryowolf: that's very much an american thing. there is a reason they say that, but it's a stupid thing to say anyways
[20:35:10] <Cryowolf> "they" and by "they" I mean a small minority
[20:35:21] <Satin> it's very edgy tbh
[20:35:23] <Cryowolf> yes it is very american ;D
[20:35:31] <Cryowolf> and provocateurish
[20:35:32] <DaPinkOne> Cryowolf, you can, it's just that being in the majority, and in the power-position for the last few hundred years, it isn't really going to hurt white people if you speak truth to power
[20:35:38] <Satin> yeah basically provactiverish
[20:35:47] <Satin> it does get the job done in raising attention, but a lot of negative attention as well
[20:35:48] <DaPinkOne> 'cause you're probably right if you're talking shit to white people
[20:35:54] <Satin> DaPinkOne: eh
[20:36:06] <darkwitch> some korean and chinese have similar enough displayed phenotypes, so I don't think it's that easy
[20:36:06] <Satin> DaPinkOne: i think it's just unhelpful framing
[20:36:13] <paine> how is it not crippling the current generation of white people
[20:36:15] <Satin> it's provactive and gets attention, but jesus does it stoke tensions
[20:36:19] <paine> who inherited a system
[20:36:35] <Satin> no white people in the US are getting crippled per se in this context 
[20:36:50] <paine> and at the moment it's currently a work in progress to change it but i think that actively bringing down "the white man" just because is not helping anything
[20:36:53] <Satin> they generally enjoy higher inherited wealth, privilege in various arenas
[20:36:56] <Cryowolf> DaPinkOne, I'm in the underclass. If someone thinks this gives me privilege cause I'm white and in Sweden, they're blinded by their ideology
[20:37:09] <paine> i am not american
[20:37:14] <Satin> paine: what are you?
[20:37:16] <Satin> french?
[20:37:22] <paine> canadian

[20:39:30] <Satin> Honestly I'm glad I don't make my edgy jokes on IRC at all. I don't feel like it
[20:39:33] <ButterNoodle> french canadians dont apologize Satin... we have found the truth
[20:39:41] <Satin> on discord i tell my canadian friend who's rude "ok snow mexican"
[20:39:45] <Satin> but i wouldn't say that here :3
[20:39:53] <paine> o.o
[20:39:55] <paine> LOL
[20:39:58] <DaPinkOne> Satin, "edgy" jokes tend to rely on an out-group and punching down. they're not usually worth it
[20:40:07] <Satin> DaPinkOne: hehehehehehe
[20:40:13] <MootPoot> punching in the nuts
[20:40:20] <Satin> DaPinkOne: not worth my reputation here, and i just don't even feel like it
[20:40:25] <Satin> maybe because this feels like a more adult space in general
[20:40:31] <Cryowolf> I don't believe in the whole "punching down" or "punching up" thing when it comes to comedy
[20:40:33] <ButterNoodle> lolwut

[20:41:38] <Cryowolf> I still think there are probably jokes you shouldn't say because...they're just not funny
[20:41:43] <Satin> yeah
[20:41:55] <Cryowolf> You can still say them
[20:41:57] <Satin> and don't get me wrong, i'm no angel. as long as someone isn't being very public about it
[20:41:59] <Cryowolf> but you'd be an idiot
[20:42:05] <Satin> in private with friends if the joke is funny i'll hear it
[20:42:14] <Satin> but often racist jokes are just for shock humour and not very funny at all
[20:42:15] <MootPoot> succ
[20:42:17] <DaPinkOne> Cryowolf, you can say anything you want(mostly), but that doesn't mean people will like you for it
[20:42:17] <Satin> in my experience
[20:42:30] <Satin> or they're very over-done and not original stereotypes
[20:42:37] <Cryowolf> DaPinkOne, yes
[20:42:44] <paine> i have experienced a lot of jokes surrounding paedophilia in here 
[20:42:49] <Satin> or often in discord VCs in say, public social or political servers
[20:42:50] <paine> and i think i've been here like three days
[20:42:56] <Satin> i'll hear joke about mexican women from racist white guys
[20:43:01] <Satin> so idk anymore lol
[20:43:03] <DaPinkOne> paine, that's somewhat surprising. 
[20:43:21] <Satin> paine: lol
[20:43:31] <Satin> DaPinkOne: that isn't surprising
[20:43:31] <paine> really? i thought it was the norm
[20:43:36] <Satin> paine: it's the norm in this channel
[20:43:47] <Cryowolf> If I can think of a joke about race that I think is funny, I will share it with someone
[20:43:49] <DaPinkOne> Satin, not that the jokes were had, but that they were had all within 3 days
[20:43:53] <Satin> paine: but i've also been here since i was 14 in 2014
[20:44:01] <Satin> paine: and i'm sick and tired of the "loli wars"
[20:44:07] <Satin> we've had actual pedos in this channel just FYI
[20:44:09] <Cryowolf> a joke about race doesn't make me racist, nor the joke. There can even be an underlying message
[20:44:09] <DaPinkOne> I've been in here off and on since around 2005
[20:44:11] <Satin> !seen pawz
[20:44:11] <ImoutoBot> Satin: pawz was last seen in #anime 6 years ago: <pawz> YOU'RE SUCH A FUCKING HYPOCRITE 
[20:44:39] <DaPinkOne> that guy was a massive creep
[20:44:45] <paine> i've been on IRC since 2001 but i didn't really go to freenerd and i only sometimes come to libera 
[20:44:49] <Satin> and as much as I disagree with sexualizing lolis, I'm not going to go up in arms and have a debate about it like has been going on for years, as long as they aren't preaching their kinks.
[20:45:02] <Satin> paine: i see
[20:45:03] <paine> yeah it's not my place to comment it's just not my thing
[20:45:17] <Satin> there's been a few other pedos as well
[20:45:20] <Satin> !seen ryonloli
[20:45:20] <ImoutoBot> Satin: I haven't seen ryonloli before.
[20:45:22] <MootPoot> shit
[20:45:24] <MootPoot> am I a pedo
[20:45:28] <Satin> !seen ryonaloli
[20:45:28] <ImoutoBot> Satin: ryonaloli was last seen in #anime 3 years and 3 months ago: <ryonaloli> i wish i was here to witness this drama...
[20:45:29] <MootPoot> idk
[20:45:30] <Cryowolf> If you wanna jerk it off to drawings, fine. Long as it's not any real people
[20:45:31] <paine> you kind of come off like that sometimes, MootPoot
[20:45:32] <Satin> little bitch
[20:45:34] <DaPinkOne> it's not my thing either, but if it's an outlet for em, it's preferably to the alternative of abusing kids
[20:45:34] <paine> you make a lot of the jokes
[20:45:35] <paine> lol
[20:45:36] <Cryowolf> so long as nobody is harmed
[20:45:45] <MootPoot> paine: no u pedo
[20:45:53] <Satin> I have my issues with these drawings being this childlike but
[20:45:56] <paine> idk i prefer my sexual partners to be older than myself
[20:46:03] <Satin> yeah ultimately it's very low priority as a topic for me
[20:46:05] <MootPoot> reverse pedo

[20:46:21] <Cryowolf> Satin, yeah I don't like it but...it's ink
[20:46:21] <paine> also, celibate
[20:46:29] <Cryowolf> or well digital 
[20:46:33] <Cryowolf> not real people
[20:46:36] <MootPoot> loli tattoos
[20:46:53] <Satin> Cryowolf: for sure, but there's reasons we ban even simulated youknowwhat.
[20:46:55] <paine> okay getting them tattoo'd is weird because that is forever

[20:47:10] <Cryowolf> Satin, Sweden doesn't
[20:47:17] <Satin> Cryowolf: I agree though broadly, I'm comfortable as long as it's not being encouraged or widespread in the mainstream
[20:47:18] <Cryowolf> precedent set a few years ago
[20:47:22] <Satin> Cryowolf: platforms like discord actively ban it
[20:47:27] <Satin> or are against it
[20:47:31] <DaPinkOne> paine, I don't know if you know this, but all tattoos are generally forever
[20:47:38] <Satin> it's not my business if ther's a statistical minority
[20:47:41] <Satin> that is into it
[20:47:41] <Cryowolf> meanwhile discord admins are actual pedos
[20:47:43] <Satin> they can do what they want
[20:47:46] <Satin> Cryowolf: indeed LOOL
[20:47:54] <MootPoot> I used to be a discord admin
[20:47:58] <paine> DaPinkOne, yup, i know that, got one myself
[20:48:03] <MootPoot> does that mean I'm a ex-pedo
[20:48:06] <Satin> Cryowolf: my views on this are also influenced by the fact, when i was an early discord user in 2015
[20:48:09] <paine> which is why having a loli tattoo'd on your body is weird
[20:48:11] <Satin> i became mod in some osu communities
[20:48:15] <Satin> ( a weeb rhythm game)
[20:48:16] <MootPoot> Satin: OH NO
[20:48:22] <paine> but i mean so is having someone's face tat'd on yourself so whatever people can do what they want
[20:48:22] * MootPoot has flashbacks
[20:48:29] <Satin> and the amount of bullshit that i had to deal with, the tons of loli stuff they posted in the nsfw channel
[20:48:31] <DaPinkOne> paine, i've considered it, but my ideals and interests shift every couple years, and I think i'd regret it
[20:48:34] <Satin> and the mix of actual pedos in there
[20:48:39] <Satin> and then the osu groomers who tried to groom me
[20:48:45] <Satin> all of it was a horrid combination
[20:48:51] <Cryowolf> I've used IRC since I was 12
[20:48:55] <Cryowolf> started on Dalnet
[20:48:57] <Cryowolf> in 1997
[20:48:58] <paine> i got a simple tattoo that i don't regret because it's out of the way, i almost never see it and i mostly forget it exists
[20:49:07] <Satin> I started using IRC when i was 12 in 2012
[20:49:19] <Satin> but properly got on the internet on my own in 2013 when i was 13
[20:49:26] <Satin> still was on irc
[20:49:29] <Satin> thank you @ foss games
[20:49:30] <Cryowolf> Satin, you youngling
[20:49:34] <Satin> Cryowolf: LOL
[20:49:47] <MootPoot> dotei-kun
[20:49:54] <Satin> I mean MootPoot is around my age too
[20:49:57] <MootPoot> satin needs a older MILF to take her
[20:50:00] <Satin> we're often the only "zoomers" here
[20:50:09] <Satin> emmeka is a millenial
[20:50:13] <Satin> clearly
[20:50:15] <MootPoot> haha boomer
[20:50:16] <Satin> davic too
[20:50:37] <MootPoot> not often - I think we are THE only ones
[20:50:47] <Satin> Cryowolf: me being so young meant I survived the gunshot bullshit far better than a more older person would have too I think
[20:50:54] <Cryowolf> I'm also a millenial. One that despises the social activist warriors. Not gonna call em "SJWs", I'll rather call em what they are :P
[20:50:58] <MootPoot> like we have a few youngers ones but I think they count as the alpha kids or something
[20:51:03] <Cryowolf> Satin, probably
[20:51:08] <Satin> my age partly meant I had a better stab at recovery in the long term
[20:51:25] <Satin> funny to think this happened a year ago, like a year ago at this date i was still in the hospital, being moved to the less intensive ICU
[20:51:33] <Satin> sheesh
[20:51:37] <DaPinkOne> we're not grouping everyone under forty as "millenials" anymore? this is a nice change.
[20:51:44] <Cryowolf> a year ago I was 2 weeks from surgery
[20:51:47] <MootPoot> davic has stabbed me twice
[20:51:53] <Satin> Cryowolf: crazy
[20:51:57] <Cryowolf> but living in the hospital
[20:52:03] <Cryowolf> it was annoying
[20:52:07] <Satin> i lived in the hospital for all of jan 2021
[20:52:11] <MootPoot> Cryowolf: sexy nurses?
[20:52:17] <MootPoot> nurse harem

[20:52:48] <Satin> i still have one in me
[20:52:51] <Cryowolf> since I could barely move
[20:52:54] <DaPinkOne> ouch :(
[20:53:01] <MootPoot> wgat
[20:53:08] <Satin> i feel it sometimes when i touch right above my torso xd
[20:53:08] <MootPoot> Satin: git it out
[20:53:13] <DaPinkOne> Satin, no metal detectors for you?
[20:53:19] <Satin> DaPinkOne: i assume so
[20:53:25] <Satin> DaPinkOne: i haven't had a chance to go through one yet
[20:53:27] <MootPoot> well lead is non ferrus so
[20:53:36] <MootPoot> it wont get picked up...I think
[20:53:38] <Satin> DaPinkOne: i know i only get CT scans strictly. No MRI.
[20:53:40] <DaPinkOne> MRI machines have giant magnets. that could be bad
[20:53:45] <Satin> Yeah
[20:53:47] <Satin> i got a ton of CT scans
[20:53:49] <MootPoot> its lead
[20:53:53] <MootPoot> lead is not magnetic
[20:54:03] <Satin> no MRI according to the doctors too
[20:54:05] <DaPinkOne> MootPoot, I don't think they make bullets from lead anymore
[20:54:09] <MootPoot> ......
[20:54:15] <MootPoot> r u ok
[20:54:19] <Cryowolf> Satin, can't you have it taken out?
[20:54:35] <Satin> Possibly now yeah. They didn't take it out before because
[20:54:46] <MootPoot> DaPinkOne: unless you are talking about very specific bullets, almost all of them are made from lead
[20:54:55] <MootPoot> usually with a extremely thin copper coating
[20:54:55] <Satin> a) it wasn't posing some active threat b) was in a difficult to reach place or whatever (right side mid torso or whatever)
[20:55:13] <Satin> c) i was heavily surgefiied ofc, they didn't want to put even more on me
[20:55:24] <Satin> they told me i could get it out later once i was recovered and stuff
[20:55:26] <Cryowolf> Satin, well if it causes you problems, it needs out
[20:55:27] <Satin> but i didn't have to
[20:55:29] <DaPinkOne> MootPoot, hmm, I thought they were entirely copper, but I'm not really the gun-hobby type. I'll take  your word for it
[20:55:36] <Satin> it isn't causing me issues currently yeah, it's just... annoying sometimes
[20:55:41] <Satin> i press against a table accidentally
[20:55:46] <Satin> and i'll slightly wince but that's about it
[20:56:00] <Satin> and it's weird to feel a knob when i touch that area but it's not painful 
[20:56:09] <Cryowolf> also hope it doesnt give you an infection
[20:56:16] <Satin> the bullet came in from behind, destroyed a part of my right lower lung
[20:56:19] <Satin> lacerated my liver
[20:56:26] <Satin> and then settled down where it is now
[20:56:27] <Satin> lmao
[20:56:39] <Satin> it won't give me an infection nah. it's been me for a year. it's part of me now!
[20:56:40] <Cryowolf> how much of your liver remains?
[20:56:54] <Satin> I don't know what chunk "died" of the liver
[20:56:55] <DaPinkOne> Satin, you're part metal. are you  a cyborg now?
[20:56:56] <Cryowolf> and has your lung healed so it can still be used?
[20:57:07] <Satin> but a lot of the bad stuff from the liver had to be drained
[20:57:21] <Satin> i had literal drain pipes attached to my adobonomum
[20:57:30] <Cryowolf> Thats normal
[20:57:31] <Satin> adobenemom i can't spell
[20:57:40] <Satin> collecting the nasty liver fluid stuff
[20:57:47] <DaPinkOne> adobe venom
[20:57:47] <Cryowolf> after my thymectomy I had a tube in my lung sack
[20:57:47] <Satin> i have scars from that too now
[20:57:55] <Satin> Cryowolf: they removed a part of my lung
[20:58:12] <Satin> apparently my lungs were collapsed anyways and i was intubated adn stuff so that was already a thing
[20:58:14] <Cryowolf> yes but does the remaining part work?
[20:58:34] <Satin> yes, over time it's regained stamina. i could barely breath much when measuring through the device they gave me to measure when i was discharged a year ago
[20:58:56] <Satin> but it does kill me inside a little when my watch tells me my fitness age is 62 or whatever
[20:58:57] <Cryowolf> good
[20:59:02] <Satin> VO2 Max reading low
[20:59:11] <Satin> trying to get into running lately
[20:59:13] <Cryowolf> Im getting my pneumonia vaccinations on feb 1
[20:59:17] <Satin> oh nice
[20:59:21] <Satin> i'm asthma-prone since childhood
[20:59:24] <Cryowolf> so I don't die from bacterial pneumonia
[20:59:27] <Satin> and have excercise induced asthma
[20:59:32] <Satin> and have had pneumonia twice before
[20:59:34] <Cryowolf> normally my spleen would handle it
[20:59:38] <Satin> i need an inhaler. dangit.
[20:59:48] <Cryowolf> but its gone
[21:00:02] <Cryowolf> I had pneumonia twice in 2 months
[21:00:04] <Satin> DaPinkOne: yes i'm cyborg i htink :P
[21:00:07] <Cryowolf> during chemo
[21:00:15] <Cryowolf> and a large abcess once
[21:00:18] <Satin> Cryowolf: damm. i had it repeatedly too, but not in that sort of vulnerable context.
[21:01:13] <Cryowolf> for the large abcess they put me in the infection ward where they set it up to protect both the person in there and those going in
[21:01:19] <Cryowolf> like a shuttle room
[21:01:21] <Satin> MootPoot: L, i had three pizza slicees this morning
[21:01:23] <Cryowolf> my own bathroom
[21:01:35] <Satin> MootPoot: i also had heart palapations last night. the S in PTSD is too real :(
[21:01:40] <Cryowolf> but I couldnt leaveit. I mean I would sign out, but that would be dumb
[21:01:45] <Satin> Cryowolf: wow
[21:01:55] <Cryowolf> could not would
[21:02:22] <Cryowolf> spent a week there with some of the strongest antibiotics there are through IV
[21:02:48] <MootPoot> Satin: why are you feeling guilty about the pizza
[21:02:58] <MootPoot> you aren't in keto so why does it matter
[21:03:11] <MootPoot> seems like you are doing just fine with your normal diet

[21:04:13] <Satin> stupid feedback loop of "oh i need to workout, oh wait i had that pizza.." lul

[21:04:57] <MootPoot> now it seems like I'm back to dropping about a kg a week
[21:04:58] <Satin> MootPoot: get dumbbells fr
[21:04:59] <MootPoot> I think
[21:04:59] <Cryowolf> I had an abcess then, which was properly drained. They also used a scissor to cut away infected skin
[21:05:35] <Satin> oh i know why i'm fucking procrastinating
[21:05:40] <Satin> i had 2h of sleep so i'm in a haze
[21:05:53] <Cryowolf> I was watching it with fascination and no anasthesia
[21:05:58] <Satin> and now that i realize MLK day will make the academic dean not respond to my emails, idk what to do
[21:06:05] <Satin> Cryowolf: eww :P
[21:06:16] <Cryowolf> as they were cuting me, cleaning out abcesses, pressing out pus
[21:06:17] <MootPoot> Satin: that explains why I cant pay attention to this JS book lmao
[21:06:22] <MootPoot> I only slept like 3-4 h
[21:06:23] <Cryowolf> cutting off skin
[21:06:26] <Satin> Cryowolf: i've had plenty of abcess stuff too
[21:06:27] <DaPinkOne> Satin, sounds like time for anime, games and sleepin
[21:06:30] <Satin> MootPoot: absolutely affects me lol
[21:06:40] <Cryowolf> I even askedfor gloves so I could help
[21:06:44] <Satin> DaPinkOne: school starts tomorrow, and idk if you were when i was explaining my situation with academic affairs
[21:06:56] <Satin> Cryowolf: but i didn't have abcesses as large as yours of course
[21:07:00] <Satin> growing up
[21:07:25] <Satin> s/were/were here/
[21:07:31] <Cryowolf> Satin, where was yours? Mine was mid abdomen to upper abdomen, maybe 15cm width, 25cm length
[21:07:49] <Satin> Cryowolf: thigh and such, but this was a long time ago when i was a kid, partly growing up in india
[21:07:58] <Cryowolf> ah
[21:08:03] <Satin> Cryowolf: I feel like i have far better hygeine than back then, and also the climate is different here
[21:08:06] <Satin> less sweat and what not
[21:08:18] <MootPoot> sweaty taint
[21:08:19] <Satin> idk what causes them
[21:08:40] <Satin> infection
[21:08:44] <MootPoot> cum
[21:08:46] <Satin> so yeah, more prone over there
[21:09:01] <Cryowolf> well...I mean no offense when I say this but. When you shit and then use a water bottle and your left hand to clean your ass without washing your hand. There's only improvement to be done. Granted that's probably the lower class
[21:09:06] <Cryowolf> and underclass
[21:09:21] <Satin> that's mostly rural folks that it happens to
[21:09:23] <MootPoot> tbh - water > paper
[21:09:31] <MootPoot> toilet paper is barbaric
[21:09:34] <Satin> and no, my family had a full western toilet and all of that even if if they used a bidet etc which is common
[21:09:35] <Cryowolf> MootPoot, sure if you have a bid√©t
[21:09:36] <MootPoot> bidet 4 lyf
[21:09:38] <Satin> and it still happens
[21:09:53] <MootPoot> Cryowolf: I have one of those japanese ass blasting toilets
[21:09:53] <DaPinkOne> I prefer the bidet, followed by toilet paper to dry
[21:09:55] <Satin> just the climate, ways homes are set up, and me as a kid being wild ig
[21:09:56] <Cryowolf> but if you're using your hand to scrape the poop off with some water
[21:10:01] <Cryowolf> that's not better
[21:10:04] <MootPoot> DaPinkOne: my bidet has a built in warm air dryer

[21:15:26] <Satin> and i want the best, i don't want to spend a pretty pound and end up with "small nagging issues" and feel like i don't have the reasonable best option
[21:15:58] <DaPinkOne> yeah, i spent a lot of money building a tiny keyboard, and I don't ever use it, 'cause I can't figure out how to manage the layers
[21:16:16] <Satin> layers?
[21:16:17] <Satin> also lol
[21:16:19] <Satin> that happens
[21:16:23] <Satin> keyboard shit is an expensive hobby
[21:16:24] <DaPinkOne> it'd be nicer if it was a split board too

[21:19:06] <DaPinkOne> it's loud compared to a desktop, but the performance is there

[21:19:42] <DaPinkOne> Satin, I've been using this "medito" app before bed for a couple weeks, and I kindof like it
[21:19:45] <Satin> hmmm yeah i should try that i guess. even after falling asleep it's like
[21:19:49] <Satin> i sleep for 2-3 hours solidly
[21:19:54] <Satin> then wake up and can't fall back to sleep

[21:19:57] <Cryowolf> no tv
[21:19:58] <Satin> after using the restroom or whatever
[21:20:05] <Satin> Cryowolf: at all during the night? even if you wake up randomly?
[21:20:17] <Satin> I guess I should make some hard rules like that for myself
[21:20:18] <Cryowolf> also, have your room be lit in a very subtle red
[21:20:25] <Satin> oh huh
[21:20:37] <Satin> my monitors even when dimmed are pretty illuminating ig

[21:47:48] <ButterNoodle> I'm trying to force my body to like it tho
[21:48:00] <DaPinkOne> sprinting up hills isn't too bad for your form, 'cause you'll land on your toes. It's really hard on the calves though
[21:48:00] <Satin> and now i'm discovering that running on steep slopes is just going to be bad for you generally

[21:48:57] <ButterNoodle> Satin: need an ointment?
[21:49:00] <Satin> yeah i think so
[21:49:08] <Satin> ill wear it on my other hand till then
[21:49:26] <Bco1981> if it's alergic reaction, use clear nail polish on the watches backside.
[21:49:35] <ButterNoodle> cat dementia.. its a thing
[21:49:46] <Satin> i have cleaning wipes for lens too Bco1981 
[21:49:49] <Satin> maybe that'll help?
[21:49:57] <ButterNoodle> Satin: metal back?
[21:49:59] <Satin> i haven't bought nail polish in a while
[21:50:01] <Satin> ButterNoodle: yeah
[21:50:13] <ButterNoodle> clean and let dry w alcohol
[21:50:21] <Bco1981> not if it's a alergic reaction, then next your skin comes in contact with the back of the watch, it will be the same.
[21:50:22] <ButterNoodle> Bco1981 suggestion is good
[21:50:24] <Bco1981> seal it.

[22:00:11] <Satin> rlx
[22:00:26] <okky> girlfriends are overrated
[22:00:45] <Bco1981> only thing relevant is... everyday you see other people around you starting to go gray.

[22:01:02] <Bco1981> and checking, yourself if you have started yet.

[22:07:09] <Satin> Damm
[22:07:19] <emmeka> I wear my hair in a ponytail. Have since basically forever.
[22:07:24] <MootPoot> emmeka: 
[22:07:25] <Satin> i see i see
[22:07:27] <MootPoot> I have a question
[22:07:29] <MootPoot> about farming
[22:07:31] <MootPoot> and tractors
[22:07:34] <emmeka> because my hair is real thick, real dark and dead straight
[22:07:38] <ButterNoodle> emmeka: tiddy nipple length or ass crack length
[22:07:40] <emmeka> it's annoying any other way
[22:07:41] <Satin> MootPoot: no longer a developer
[22:07:48] <Satin> you're a farmer now
[22:07:49] <MootPoot> Satin: ?
[22:07:50] <MootPoot> yes
[22:07:53] <MootPoot> I farm code
[22:07:55] <Satin> no
[22:07:57] <Satin> you farm the crops
[22:08:02] <Poeticode> i ragret cutting my hair i'm jelly emmeka
[22:08:04] <Satin> prepare for the harvest
[22:08:05] <emmeka> ButterNoodle past shoulders, usually I cut it back a few inches when it gets to nip length
[22:08:12] <emmeka> MootPoot go on
[22:08:18] <ButterNoodle> my bear is as long as ur hair
[22:08:21] <ButterNoodle> *beard
[22:08:40] <MootPoot> emmeka: I hear all this shit about john deere making their stuff impossible to DIY fix and how farmers hate it and whatnot and it sucks for them - what's keeping them from buying from not* john deere
[22:08:54] <ButterNoodle> IH
[22:08:55] <MootPoot> a non-green tractor/combine/farm machinery
[22:09:03] <ButterNoodle> yea anything else
[22:09:05] <MootPoot> there has to be other makers right
[22:09:10] <emmeka> in practice the other major manufacturers behave similarly, JD is just especially douchey about it
[22:09:11] <ButterNoodle> :|
[22:09:12] <ButterNoodle> HAAS
[22:09:14] <ButterNoodle> IH
[22:09:20] <emmeka> but, also, farmers have brand commitment
[22:09:25] <emmeka> like generational brand commitment
[22:09:29] <emmeka> and JD rewards this
[22:09:38] <ButterNoodle> I see very little green in my county
[22:09:42] <ButterNoodle> because poor
[22:09:44] <MootPoot> like the "my daddy got ford/chevy so will I"
[22:09:48] <Roey> also, they might be invested in a aentire ecosystem of JD eqipment
[22:09:49] <MootPoot> kind of commitment?
[22:09:51] <ButterNoodle> lots of red
[22:09:57] <emmeka> they have this rewards points system which accrues for decades and can be passed down in the family, so people who buy JD have a strong incentive to stay with it
[22:09:58] <Roey> w/ existing support contracts
[22:10:08] <emmeka> because when you've been buying JD for 50 years you get major discounts
[22:10:19] <ford> MootPoot: you rang? :D
[22:10:28] <MootPoot> wha
[22:10:35] <emmeka> also yes, Roey is right
[22:10:38] <MootPoot> !?
[22:10:41] <DaPinkOne> emmeka, that sounds like predatory undercutting of competitors and/or vendor lock-in.
[22:10:45] <Bco1981> ButterNoodle: my switches have arrived... but i can't use them. i don't have the power cable i need. it has that damn slit plug.
[22:10:46] <DaPinkOne> that should probably be illegal
[22:10:47] <MootPoot> we had a guy named ford lmao
[22:10:55] <ButterNoodle> emmeka: ? 
[22:10:56] <MootPoot> soz I was writing something else
[22:11:05] <ButterNoodle> agribusiness gets what they deserve
[22:11:10] <emmeka> DaPinkOne probably. really, most of their business model is an antitrust issue, the only reason it isn't is because they have competitors.
[22:11:26] <MootPoot> So is there no realistic option for them at all?
[22:11:38] <MootPoot> either get fucked by JD , or one of the other makers
[22:11:39] <emmeka> MootPoot there's other reasons too. JD has certain product lines that virtually none of the other manufacturers really bother with anymore.
[22:11:43] <emmeka> they make everything
[22:11:48] <emmeka> even for small end equipment
[22:12:31] <MootPoot> damn
[22:12:35] <emmeka> it's like, their Frontier or Pioneer line or something? They make the kind of 3 point hitch equipment you run with a 25hp tractor, and nobody does this in the developed world anymore besides them
[22:13:06] <MootPoot> there's nobody importing cheap tractors or stuff like that from the asias?
[22:13:14] <MootPoot> if its 25hp then its probably small right

[22:14:03] <emmeka> MootPoot there are other options, the big competitors are CNH (Case/New Holland, plus some other brands), and AGCO which has like Massey, Fendt, Challenger so on
[22:14:07] <MootPoot> or are farmers generally not a fan of maintaining their own equipment
[22:14:16] <emmeka> and there's other smaller companies ofc, like say Versatile, a Canadian company
[22:14:20] <emmeka> or imports
[22:14:25] <ButterNoodle> poor farmers maintain their own equipment
[22:15:15] <emmeka> MootPoot farmers mostly maintain their own equipment for the sort of maintenance that is normal. Belts, hydraulics, fluids, filters, the normal shit
[22:15:24] <emmeka> but a modern tractor is half computer
[22:15:29] <emmeka> that is where the difficulties start
[22:16:23] <MootPoot> why does a modern tractor need to be half computer
[22:16:25] <emmeka> ButterNoodle lots of those imports are more targetted at the compact range. But Kubota has been trying to buy up US manufacturers recently and go into larger models.
[22:16:35] <MootPoot> like with cars its legal and liability and emissions and dumb drivers + driver assist
[22:16:37] <MootPoot> etc
[22:16:51] <MootPoot> to keep soccer moms from crashing their minivan in 1cm of snow
[22:17:08] <emmeka> MootPoot because it can drive itself and do zany shit with GPS, also emissions, also it has like ten bazillion different modes that can be programmed for various shit
[22:17:23] <MootPoot> there are emissions testing for farm equipment?
[22:17:26] <MootPoot> wack
[22:17:32] <emmeka> generally
[22:17:33] <DaPinkOne> calling it a tractor is a bit of an understatement then
[22:17:40] <Satin> MootPoot: wanna hear a random story
[22:17:45] <MootPoot> I thought anything that dosen't go on the road was except 
[22:17:51] <MootPoot> exempt*
[22:17:53] <MootPoot> Satin: sure
[22:18:20] <Satin> okay i'm going to be slightly longwinded but it's b/c this partly means something to me i guess
[22:18:36] <emmeka> MootPoot it's not like road vehicles where they are done regularly, but there are still standards manufacturers have to adhere to
[22:19:18] <Satin> MootPoot: so basically last year, around the time i was discharged from the hospital in early feb, i was looking up things on my phone (the world seemingly was trodding along and i felt left behind and stuff)
[22:19:33] <Satin> and when i looked up "new mexico" once mindlessly on google and looked at the news results
[22:19:50] <Satin> i saw the story of a police officer killed in a traffic stop or something
[22:19:58] <emmeka> MootPoot but like yes to answer your question it is technically possible to buy tractors today that do not have any of the right-to-repair issues of JD. However, doing so makes all the precision ag technology fairly inaccessible to you.
[22:19:59] <MootPoot> emmeka: so is it like this globally?
[22:20:09] <MootPoot> EU etc
[22:20:13] <Satin> so that's the first time i heard of the darian jarrot story, i was like, damm this sucks
[22:20:19] <emmeka> MootPoot how should I know?
[22:20:25] <MootPoot> global farmer
[22:20:27] <MootPoot> :3
[22:20:35] <MootPoot> also - are those technologies like worth the cost benefit or are they just attractive gimmicks
[22:20:47] <MootPoot> like - say you have a GPS combine that self-harvests
[22:20:50] <Satin> then many months later, i think around aug or something last year i came across some wikipedia page because i was curious about the state patrol offices around here and stuff
[22:20:55] <emmeka> that's not how they work
[22:21:00] <MootPoot> no?
[22:21:06] <emmeka> they don't "self-harvest". you still have to operate it.
[22:21:13] <Satin> and the only police officer from the new mexico state patrol that had been killed in decades was on that wikipedia listing or whatever, and it was his name
[22:21:18] <emmeka> what the GPS and autosteer do is keep your lines straight
[22:21:19] <Satin> so i look it up and damm
[22:21:19] <MootPoot> then what's the point if you still have to do personal work

[22:21:25] <MootPoot> oh, so they are just assists
[22:21:27] <emmeka> and minimize overlap
[22:21:33] <emmeka> and maximize speed
[22:21:36] <Satin> MootPoot: if you can stomach stuff like this, you should totally watch this
[22:21:42] <emmeka> they make the most efficient patterns to cover a field and then do it
[22:22:04] <DaPinkOne> Satin, part 1/10, so presumably 10 full hours of this? I don't think my patience or faith in humanity could take it
[22:22:07] <Satin> it's fascinating, brutal, and it takes place along southern new mexico, that landscape and stuff isn't TOO far off from what i see at times though i'm more in the mountains
[22:22:14] <Satin> DaPinkOne: you just need to watch the first video lol
[22:22:15] <emmeka> MootPoot but this is a divisive question anyway.
[22:22:20] <Satin> or can skip around a bit too
[22:22:41] <emmeka> my answer would be yes, it absolutely makes a difference. does it make enough of a difference to justify the cost compared to a skilled operator? idk.
[22:22:50] <MootPoot> emmeka: I feel like this sounds of the "borderline between a gimmick and actually useful cost wise " kind of thing 
[22:22:51] <DaPinkOne> ho damn, it's all bodycam footage
[22:22:52] <Satin> but it does make me feel for police officers, i don't operate off sentamenality entierly anyways, but the stuff they deal with when they're dealing with dangerous cirminals like this is important to note
[22:22:54] <emmeka> especially with some of the new precision ag tech
[22:23:04] <Satin> DaPinkOne:  it's CRAZY. multi-agency footage

[22:23:47] <emmeka> MootPoot like for example, we have technology now that can map the soil fertility in gradients throughout the field down to the square foot, and apply differing levels of fertilizer to specific spots on the field as needed where needed
[22:23:48] <DaPinkOne> Satin, dangerous criminals are still a minority. This isn't an excuse for treating every citizen as a dangerous criminal
[22:24:13] <Satin> DaPinkOne: of course of course, but there's people on the other end who are excessive in their judgements as well
[22:24:16] <DaPinkOne> I'll have a watch of the video though, and see what's up
[22:24:19] <emmeka> MootPoot the cost savings this can result in are pretty enormous when you're talking thousands of acres
[22:24:37] <Satin> DaPinkOne: it's pretty worth it if you're up for that sort of thing.
[22:24:48] <Satin> tell me how you think about it later
[22:25:21] <Satin> but yeah, i sometimes had to lower the vol when the gunshots were happening in the vid i remember but it still sends shivers down my spine and makes me re-think things sometimes
[22:25:34] <Satin> reminds of u the difference b/w life and death
[22:25:45] <Satin> also las crucas, NM isn't *that* far away from me y'know
[22:26:06] <MootPoot> Is it just bodycam footage? 
[22:26:09] <Satin> i should go there sometime, i hear they have a huge bookstore and i need to go down south more
[22:26:14] <MootPoot> I haven't watched it yet but 
[22:26:15] <Satin> MootPoot: it's multi-agency multi-cam views
[22:26:16] <dfch> ?mode -r
[22:26:17] *** Suzuka sets mode: -r 
[22:26:20] <DaPinkOne> there's some dashcam in there too
[22:26:20] <Satin> dfch: thank you
[22:26:27] <emmeka> huh, when did that happen
[22:26:31] <MootPoot> Ive seen plenty of that kind of stuff 
[22:26:36] <Satin> emmeka: amigo did it when banning the k0k guy earlier today
[22:26:39] <Satin> i asked him why
[22:26:43] <MootPoot> emmeka: amigo whacked the kid who was spamming the bot
[22:26:45] <Satin> and he said "ban evasion, it's only temporry"
[22:26:49] <DaPinkOne> emmeka, it's from feb 4, 2021
[22:26:50] <dfch> check your other highlights ;)
[22:26:51] <Satin> except that logic seems dicey
[22:27:02] <Satin> DaPinkOne: i think he's referencing the +r mode that amigo set
[22:27:06] <DaPinkOne> ah
[22:27:20] <Satin> dfch: emmeka is not 24/7 online
[22:27:24] <Satin> so he has no other hilghlights
[22:27:25] <Satin> unlike you
[22:27:29] <MootPoot> emmeka: time for some FOSS tractors
[22:27:50] <Satin> MootPoot: there's a lot of dash cam in there too
[22:27:52] <emmeka> MootPoot if only all attempts at them weren't terrible
[22:28:44] <DaPinkOne> Satin, it's odd that the camera freezeframes at the moment shots are fired.
[22:28:53] <Satin> DaPinkOne: that's on purpose
[22:28:58] <dfch> Satin, I know, highlight was my reply to when did that happen. I sort of just explained him when did it happen in other place :p
[22:29:00] <Satin> DaPinkOne: you can find the uncensored footage elsewhere
[22:29:04] <Satin> dfch: ah
[22:29:13] <Satin> DaPinkOne: i looked up the uncensored footage :P
[22:29:30] <DaPinkOne> the cop didn't seem uncivil

[22:29:35] <emmeka> MootPoot fwiw I do know a guy who makes a living jailbreaking JD tractors
[22:29:39] <emmeka> it is a thing that can be done
[22:29:42] <Satin> DaPinkOne: the cop was a fucking angel as far as i'm concerned.
[22:29:44] <Satin> in that context.
[22:29:46] <emmeka> it voids allllll the warranties
[22:29:49] <MootPoot> sounds like a niche I can get into
[22:29:52] <DaPinkOne> who are these randos on the street in full tactical gear?
[22:30:09] <Satin> drug trafficking
[22:30:13] <emmeka> but it's useful for tractors that are like, 5-10 years old and JD basically stops supporting them, lol
[22:30:16] <emmeka> like a smartphone
[22:30:28] <MootPoot> I mean if its that old, why does it void the warrenty
[22:30:31] <Satin> DaPinkOne: also a main jist of the story is that fucking homland security investigations which had set a trap for that guy to visit
[22:30:34] <MootPoot> warrenty should already be void
[22:30:44] <Satin> didn't properly inform New mexico state patrol and stuff
[22:30:46] <Satin> and some mixup happened
[22:30:51] <Satin> and jarrot was positioned there
[22:31:00] <Satin> and had *no idea* that the guy was dangerous
[22:31:04] <DaPinkOne> oh, they're cops, bu tthey're in civilian clothes with a military bulletproof vest
[22:31:08] <Satin> meanwhile the actual guy who was supposed to make the stop
[22:31:14] <Satin> DaPinkOne: yes, HSI is different
[22:31:18] <Satin> that's HSI agents.
[22:31:52] <Satin> U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Homeland security investigations unit or something like that
[22:32:28] <DaPinkOne> ah, so...this guy in the truck wouldn't have been here if homeland security hadn't baited him into bein here in the first place
[22:32:35] <Satin> arguably so
[22:32:45] <emmeka> MootPoot fwiw there is actually an attempt right now to build an open source implementation of autosteer
[22:32:55] <emmeka> it is, afaik, not really ready for use
[22:33:03] <Satin> HSI was supposed to be working with New Mexico State Patrol to make a traffic stop *or* let him drive up to las cruces and when he was making the deal, be confronted with the full array of  tactical teams and what not
[22:33:08] <Satin> and armored vehicles
[22:33:20] <Satin> except what happened is, K9 unit or whatever you can see in the video
[22:33:30] <DaPinkOne> there was a plan, and they fucked it
[22:33:36] <Satin> the people supposed to be making the stop, two different cop cars, both ahead of jarrot etc
[22:33:46] <Satin> were ahead or wahtever
[22:33:48] <JesseDesu> whoa i got 9 hours of sleep
[22:33:51] <Satin> and this guy was sitting in his usual stop
[22:33:58] <DaPinkOne> JesseDesu, congrats
[22:33:58] <Satin> and noticed tinted windows
[22:34:05] <Satin> and decided to make a polite stop
[22:34:10] <Satin> he had no clue at all, none whatsoever
[22:34:14] <Satin> of the danger involved here
[22:34:29] <emmeka> MootPoot but I'd say there's a strong incentive for manufacturers to adopt it if it comes to be, because 1) it's a hot button issue that has made the news 2) it's cheaper 3) it allows extensibility of existing software for niche applications by any rando, which is a pretty good sales pitch because ag is full of niche applications for tractors
[22:34:29] <JesseDesu> DaPinkOne, i finished decaling https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/584794355328483345/932173517183655986/20220115_232337.jpg

[22:38:40] <JesseDesu> thanks you guys
[22:39:29] <JesseDesu> i still have like 25 steps to go before its finished
[22:39:48] <JesseDesu> i wrote every single step i still need to take
[22:40:10] <MootPoot> emmeka: that would be hard to test though
[22:40:26] <MootPoot> unless you have some farmer willing to house and feed a dev out in the boonies 
[22:40:28] <DaPinkOne> JesseDesu, very meticulous planning process
[22:40:32] <MootPoot> while he works out the kinks
[22:40:43] <JesseDesu> mission planning lol
[22:41:00] <JesseDesu> i need coffee
[22:41:17] <emmeka> MootPoot no harder than JD doing it
[22:41:50] <MootPoot> well, the task is possible, the problem is financing it
[22:42:10] <DaPinkOne> funny thing about being on a farm, there aren't a lot of things/hobbies available. If it were possible, i'm sure the farmers will be getting it goin
[22:42:26] <emmeka> DaPinkOne dunno where you got that idea
[22:42:29] <MootPoot> DaPinkOne: just spend a night with the sheep like every other farmer
[22:42:54] <DaPinkOne> emmeka, is it a matter of time, resources, or knowledge?
[22:43:22] <emmeka> to me it's the city that seems devoid of hobby space. you can't go skidooing through downtown or go hunting in your suburban backyard or go hiking 2 minutes down the road, so on so sorth
[22:43:25] <emmeka> *forth
[22:43:42] <emmeka> but it's just a difference in what kind of activities you can do
[22:43:44] <DaPinkOne> emmeka, I guess it's just different hobbies
[22:44:00] <DaPinkOne> there's more of the things I want to do here in the city, I just can't afford to do them :(
[22:44:09] <emmeka> I mean, you live in the countryside where there is more outdoor than indoor, you do outdoor hobbies
[22:44:32] <Aurora_v_kosmose> > I just can't afford to do them :( | Yep.
[22:44:34] <MootPoot> emmeka: both of those things are perfectly doable in the city - the challenge is just getting away with it
[22:44:34] <JesseDesu> i'd imagine farmers dont have time for hobbies
[22:44:39] <JesseDesu> so much work 
[22:44:47] <emmeka> JesseDesu and yet, winter
[22:44:50] <Aurora_v_kosmose> JesseDesu: You'd be imagining wrong.
[22:44:53] <DaPinkOne> JesseDesu, plants kindof grow themselves

[22:45:06] <JesseDesu> what if you got plants and animals
[22:45:08] * emmeka coats DaPinkOne in glyphosate
[22:45:11] <DaPinkOne> harvest season is rough though I expect
[22:45:15] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Even without automation, there isn't a whole lot to do in winter.
[22:45:16] <emmeka> you tell that to the bugs and weeds
[22:45:34] <DaPinkOne> emmeka, it's got what bees crave?
[22:45:39] <Aurora_v_kosmose> With automation, both plants & animals can be a lot less troblesome.
[22:45:42] <dfch> bugs and weebs

[22:46:02] <JesseDesu> do you have enough hobby time
[22:46:05] <JesseDesu> to build a model
[22:46:08] <emmeka> whereas seeding and harvest time are like GO GO GO GO GO for 16 hour days for weeks
[22:46:13] <emmeka> and then, you chill
[22:46:30] <ezekielnoob> yeah my grandfather is a farmer, he was chill on a lot of times
[22:46:35] <DaPinkOne> JesseDesu, models can wait for you to come back, if you've got a spare moment here and there
[22:46:47] <emmeka> I'm pretty chill. look how much time I spend with you dorks.
[22:46:55] <DaPinkOne> model building is more about where you're gonna keep em when you're done imo
[22:47:08] <emmeka> there are times of the year where I'm impossibly busy but such is life
[22:47:09] <JesseDesu> my grandfather has like 4 farms in the philippines
[22:47:10] <MootPoot> GODDAMN
[22:47:17] <MootPoot> no wonder my montior was flickering off
[22:47:17] <emmeka> if only I liked icefishing :(
[22:47:27] <MootPoot> its like easily 40C-50C to the touch
[22:47:29] <JesseDesu> he rides a yamaha 125cc tricycle
[22:47:42] <DaPinkOne> MootPoot, that's a spicy monitor
[22:47:44] <Bco1981> tricycle...
[22:47:56] <emmeka> I could just IRC from my icefishing hut, like you do
[22:48:04] <JesseDesu> tricycles are common in the phillippines
[22:48:20] <DaPinkOne> emmeka, what kind of hut doesn't have wifi? we live in a society
[22:48:32] <emmeka> ones you place on a frozen lake
[22:48:41] <dfch> bco1981 probably thinking: but can you icefish in vr?
[22:49:00] <DaPinkOne> emmeka, no 4g?
[22:49:03] <Bco1981> i think i saw a fishing vr game
[22:49:11] <Bco1981> there might be ice fishing in it, idk.
[22:49:12] <MootPoot> If Ice fishing is boring you can seal club instead 
[22:49:18] <emmeka> dfch that'd be hard, it'd have to be full dive VR, because that's the only way you could simulate the primary activity of icefishing: drinking beer
[22:49:37] <emmeka> you'd think you go icefishing to catch fish. this is not the case
[22:49:38] <dfch> Bco1981, no-no, actual icefishing while on irc in vr
[22:49:51] <emmeka> you go there to have a place to drink beer with buddies, while pretending to try to fish
[22:49:53] <MootPoot> emmeka: water bladder filled with beer
[22:49:53] <DaPinkOne> emmeka, that's not unique to ice fishing. that's just fishing
[22:49:59] <MootPoot> Problem solved
[22:50:09] <emmeka> well, most fishing is more active and also you can't drink and boat.
[22:50:30] <emmeka> icefishing permits full drunkenness
[22:50:32] <Bco1981> dfch: the quest 2 is wireless, but people advise against it since the headset has a hard time knowing where your boundaries are.
[22:50:36] <DaPinkOne> emmeka, the designated sober guy drives the boat and talks to the cops
[22:50:36] <dfch> emmeka, I have some childhood memories of ice fishing, boring, grown ups getting drunk before noon and cold.

[22:50:41] <dfch> Gosh I kinda miss it
[22:50:53] <MootPoot> What if you get your foot stuck in the hole
[22:51:03] <Bco1981> but technically it's possible with the quest2
[22:51:05] <dfch> Bco1981, working temperature also might be an issue
[22:51:14] <emmeka> dfch same. it's got this weird nostalgia for me. but then I try it and I think "wait, this is just drinking beer in a shack"
[22:51:25] <MootPoot> Also... If you have to shit or piss while ice fishing do you just 
[22:51:29] <MootPoot> Do it in the hole
[22:51:44] <emmeka> why not
[22:51:47] <dfch> Haha, right
[22:52:11] <MootPoot> But... That's where you're getting your fish from! 
[22:52:19] <MootPoot> Shitty fish
[22:52:28] <emmeka> there's a whole lotta lake down there, generally
[22:53:40] <dfch> Bco1981: btw, 3 more days approx till both mobos arrive, it seems like a shortage of 12gen intel CPUs, because it is usually takes half of day

[22:56:54] <Bco1981> jbwncster: don't have anything that is good in the same price range as the 12400
[22:57:29] <Bco1981> 12400 even beats 3700x, 12threads against 16 threads.
[22:58:25] <jbwncster> What about ryzen pro?
[22:58:40] <Bco1981> even worse concidering price
[22:58:59] <jbwncster> Ryzen 9?
[22:59:24] <Bco1981> that will be faster then 12400, but at 3x price
[22:59:34] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It's kind of disappointing that high-end TR is literally not worth it instead of just moving on to EPYC
[23:00:06] <dfch> TR is awesome if its free :p
[23:00:12] <Aurora_v_kosmose> dfch: Indeed
[23:00:19] <Bco1981> yeah i have been looking at maybe a threadripper... bur looks like mobos are limited to 256gb ram...
[23:00:26] <dfch> tr4 to be precise
[23:00:33] <ford> why isn't TR worth it compared to epyc?
[23:00:40] <Aurora_v_kosmose> dfch: I just meant that I noticed there's an intersect beyond which EPYC has better cost-ratio than TR.
[23:00:54] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ford: Basically past 20-ish threads EPYC becomes cheaper.
[23:01:00] *** Parts: okky (~okky_4@67.21.186.96) (Leaving)
[23:01:02] <Aurora_v_kosmose> At least last time I looked
[23:01:07] <ford> the boards are probably more expensive though
[23:01:15] <Bco1981> lol and the lowest threadripper is 24 cores
[23:01:15] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Somewhat.
[23:01:24] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Bco1981: Ah, used to be lower than that.
[23:01:36] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Guess my 2020 evaluation is no longer valid.
[23:02:11] <ford> I'm running cascade lake xeons, so I'm in no place to talk about price-to-performance :P
[23:02:32] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Intel is still lagging behind in core-count.
[23:03:00] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Which given the success of VMs & orchestrated jobs, is kinda unfortunate.
[23:03:16] <ford> I still wouldn't trust AMD in the data center. for a workstation, sure
[23:03:30] <Bco1981> the latest 12th gen can beat amd line core for core.

[23:08:58] <JesseDesu> its ok i graduated at 25
[23:09:01] <Satin> i am *forced* to take it slow
[23:09:06] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Why rush when the endpoint is just dying anyway?
[23:09:24] <JesseDesu> most people graduate at 22 with full load of classes each semester
[23:09:41] <Satin> Yeah well I started college in 2017 fall
[23:09:48] <Satin> and started with fairly basic classes
[23:09:52] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That assumes a lot. Namely a stable income & housing situation.
[23:09:54] <Satin> i retook a class here and there like trig
[23:10:02] <Satin> because that was the first time in my life i had seen it
[23:10:04] <JesseDesu> trig is hard
[23:10:09] <JesseDesu> math anal
[23:10:14] <Satin> and then i did calc 1 in fall 2019
[23:10:31] <Satin> i skipped spring 2020 because i thought i was transferring to my new mexico college in fall 2020
[23:10:35] <Satin> so i worked at chic fil A instead
[23:10:46] <Satin> which was okay but at the same time meant i took a year off 
[23:10:54] <JesseDesu> i never dined there
[23:10:56] <JesseDesu> is it good
[23:10:56] <Satin> then fall 2020 happens, and it's right in the middle of covid and i have a hard time getting settled
[23:11:11] <Satin> but i had 2 As, 1 B, 1 D my first semester
[23:11:31] <JesseDesu> so you got BAAD
[23:11:32] <Satin> the D only happened because i couldn't bother to study chem with my other workload (even though technically i knew most basic chem from an earlier class in community college)
[23:11:54] <Satin> then spring 2021 right before the semester began, around new years, i got shot multiple times
[23:12:05] <Satin> then fall 2021 i had untreated PTSD
[23:12:07] <JesseDesu> ugh i get nightmares about being in high school again and not being prepared for chem or math tests
[23:12:08] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I had issues during studying related to housing & costs.
[23:12:19] <Satin> (still not treated btw, finally trying to get an appointment in, backlogged to jan 28)
[23:12:28] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Thankfully I managed to notice & remove courses from my load before the limits.
[23:12:32] <Satin> and i couldn't deal with the stress, i learnt more about how my own PTSD operates and what not myself
[23:12:44] <Satin> but i withdrew from all classes fall 2021
[23:12:52] <Satin> and now here we are, spring 2022 starts tomorrow
[23:13:00] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Nothing like flirting with homelessness to distract you from studying.
[23:13:10] <Satin> Aurora_v_kosmose: awch yeah
[23:13:22] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Also slumlords should be given concrete boots and kicked off a pier.
[23:13:25] <Satin> I'm not entirely prepared but I feel more prepared than i ever have been at this school
[23:13:56] <Satin> JesseDesu: this school is relatively hard
[23:14:07] <dfch> Aurora_v_kosmose, easy there my little red guard.
[23:14:17] <dfch> That's bad...
[23:14:18] <Satin> dfch: he's right

[23:14:25] <Satin> oh yeah
[23:14:28] <Aurora_v_kosmose> lol
[23:14:42] <Satin> JesseDesu: and the old me who had a 4.0 GPA in community college probably would have figured out a way to study eventually

[23:14:58] <Satin> close to it
[23:15:17] <JesseDesu> cummunity kollege
[23:15:19] <DaPinkOne> Satin, I've been in college for 3 years, what is this "properly studying"?
[23:15:23] <Satin> yeah but the problem was that while i did moderately fine in community college and easily excelled at humanities and what not
[23:15:37] <Satin> and was close to an A in calc 1 were it not for starting work at chic fil A
[23:15:43] <Satin> i didn't feel like i had a studying method properly down
[23:15:54] <Bco1981> !later tell beaky https://youtu.be/wfxtntXxokg
[23:15:57] <Satin> and then i lost all momentum by skipping spring 2020 since i was transferring in the fall
[23:16:01] <Satin> DaPinkOne: lol
[23:16:09] <DaPinkOne> Satin, I never could hold down a job and study at the same time. work is too stressful
[23:16:13] <Satin> DaPinkOne: I still don't know how to take effective notes and stuff. And I'm only now figuring this out
[23:16:17] <Satin> DaPinkOne: yeah i feel you
[23:16:23] <DaPinkOne> especially near finals
[23:16:44] <Satin> also feels like i've gone back in time, i don't remember how the old me was like, it feels reset ever since the shooting, and i'm learning to accept that
[23:16:52] <Satin> rebuilding work ethic is hard too
[23:17:06] <DaPinkOne> I've got semi-decent study habits, as a coping mechanism I was tought in the 8th grade
[23:17:13] <Satin> DaPinkOne: count me jealous
[23:17:24] <Satin> i was homeschoold entirely before community college
[23:17:29] <DaPinkOne> it's a coping mechanism, it's not always enough
[23:17:34] <Satin> i feel that
[23:17:43] <JesseDesu> satin wants to become a USAF fighter pilot
[23:17:45] <Satin> and i only did as well as i did in community college because i more or less had some foundation to go off and i did problems
[23:17:51] <JesseDesu> you still got time i think
[23:17:55] <JesseDesu> 27 is the cutoff
[23:17:57] <Satin> JesseDesu: i'm permanantly surgified, don't say things like that
[23:18:18] <Satin> i'm doing my best to lose weight and gain muscle strength for the first time in my life
[23:18:29] <Satin> so i'll be the best i could be, but i very much doubt i'll ever be capable of that sort of position Lol
[23:18:33] <JesseDesu> ok maybe just the stress thing then
[23:18:40] <DaPinkOne> could still be a civilian pilot eventually, if that's what you're about
[23:18:54] <Satin> i'm in CS but i hate big tech and the tech industry at large
[23:18:57] <Satin> and their role in society
[23:19:05] <JesseDesu> i want to pilot an F-16 as a civilian
[23:19:06] <Satin> i don't even know how to program entirely yet but getting there o.o
[23:19:12] <JesseDesu> i'd keep it to 3Gs max tho
[23:19:18] <DaPinkOne> Satin, i've already sold my soul for money once. I'll do it again, I guess

[23:26:10] <Satin> and of course there's stuff like machine learning which is half snake oil but half interesting
[23:26:17] <DaPinkOne> Satin, so why don't you use bioinformatics to model the biology of marine life?
[23:26:20] <Satin> also statistics would be nice to actually learn for once, so i can talk about things

[23:34:10] <DaPinkOne> it's not really necessary for calc 2
[23:34:10] <Satin> i have to wait and survive calc 2 this semester before that
[23:34:20] <Satin> i know it isn't but i think it abstractedly boosts your matheamtical thinking skills

[23:34:52] <Bco1981> Aurora_v_kosmose: oh so you wern't talking about regular private drones.
[23:35:00] <Satin> calc 2 is one of the hardest classes in general
[23:35:02] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Bco1981: Nope.
[23:35:03] <Satin> and has a very high fail rate
[23:35:11] <Satin> last semester i didn't really give it a good try or anything 
[23:35:21] <Satin> i was more busy with dealing with other stuff so i didn't even attend class

[23:36:22] <Satin> i'm at my goal school
[23:36:27] <DaPinkOne> it was less available for calc 4, unfortunately, 'cause everybody who took it at the community college bounced to university
[23:36:28] <Roey> Satin: good luck btw
[23:36:30] <Aurora_v_kosmose> So yeah, political licenses tend to have the issue that they can limit legitimate uses.
[23:36:32] <Satin> a friend of a friend from someone in this IRC became my senpai/mentor

[23:37:10] <dfch> Satin you talking about beaky rnt ya?
[23:37:15] <Satin> no. never
[23:37:17] <Roey> DaPinkOne: what's Calc 4 deal with? For folks like me at the University of Maryland in College Park, we had calc 1-3, then differential equations, linear algebra, signals & systems, etc.
[23:37:33] *** Quits: totoro9 (~ttr@176.109.187.34) (Quit: leaving)
[23:37:36] <Roey> I dind't take calc 3 but the other buggers I sure did
[23:37:39] <DaPinkOne> Roey, calc 4 was integration in 3+ dimensions
[23:37:39] <JesseDesu> when amazon says "Only 1 left in stock - order soon. ", it makes me wanna buy it even more
[23:37:45] <JesseDesu> what is that called in psychology
[23:37:48] <Roey> DaPinkOne: oh, ok, so that's calc3 here
[23:38:01] <DaPinkOne> Calc 3 was convergeance and divergeance of series
[23:38:04] <Aurora_v_kosmose> JesseDesu: Fear of Missing Out
[23:38:05] <Satin> weird
[23:38:12] <Satin> calc 3 at most schools i hear is multiple dimensions
[23:38:13] <Roey> that was calc 2 stuff for me
[23:38:15] <Satin> 3+ dimensions yeah
[23:38:17] <Satin> yeah

[23:38:25] <Roey> satin what's your major?
[23:38:27] <Satin> CS
[23:38:33] <Roey> JesseDesu++
[23:38:36] <Satin> usually most schools have us take calc 3 but i only need to take calc 2
[23:38:37] <Roey> Satin: ah, lovely :)
[23:38:38] <DaPinkOne> calc 2 was integration, and calc 1 was differentiation(but not diff eq)
[23:38:41] <Satin> this semester
[23:38:43] <Satin> then other math
[23:38:46] <Roey> Satin: you using linux / python yet?
[23:38:47] <Jigsy> CounterStrike is a major now?

[23:39:21] <Roey> Satin: *wonderful* you're a unicorn, all the geek guys will go after you like you're wearing magnets
[23:39:23] <Jigsy> My inability to do math is the reason I can never be a progammer.
[23:39:28] <JesseDesu> i wanna say i majored in counter strike
[23:39:31] <Satin> Roey: no, i stick to myself lol
[23:39:33] <Roey> Satin: anything in security specifcially
[23:39:37] <Roey> Satin: lol :)
[23:39:40] <Satin> Roey: no, though i do want to learn basic stuff
[23:39:49] <dfch> where can I get roblox degree?
[23:39:54] <Satin> but i don't feel excited about cybersecurity networking type of shit
[23:39:56] <JesseDesu> are programmers generally smarter people
[23:39:59] <DaPinkOne> Jigsy, my roommate's a decent programmer, and he's got disgraphia. he can't do math for shit
[23:40:01] <Roey> Satin: ah ok great! hopeuflly they offer computer security courses
[23:40:02] <Satin> i'm more interested in cybersecurity and malware stuff if that makes sense?
[23:40:05] <Roey> Satin: in your major
[23:40:10] <Roey> Satin: yeah it sure does.
[23:40:13] <Bco1981> ugh, roblox
[23:40:17] <Satin> well my school is affilated with the NSA and stuff
[23:40:22] <Satin> so if i want to, maybe
[23:40:23] <Jigsy> ...
[23:40:24] <Satin> but idk yet

[23:40:35] <Roey> get on their radar
[23:40:36] <JesseDesu> i can make pretty good spaghetti, i should be a pretty good programmer
[23:40:37] <Satin> i would have to get out of the way if i went down that route

[23:40:43] <Urchin[emacs]> dfch: the secret of roblox is that it fucks over everyone except the owners
[23:40:45] <Satin> Roey: I don't know if i want to do cybersecurity lol
[23:40:49] <Roey> ahhhhhhh
[23:40:50] <Satin> as in hardware type of stuff
[23:40:51] <emmeka> Satin you traitor
[23:40:54] <Roey> it's just a lot of $$$$$

[23:40:58] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Satin: I think they're usually called "ethical" licenses
[23:41:06] <dfch> Urchin[emacs], perfect "game" it is then
[23:41:16] <Satin> Roey: bioinformatics looks interesting, so does whatever shit that people do with algos and data science maybe but yeah.
[23:41:20] <Satin> i'm open options here
[23:41:28] <Satin> emmeka: lol call me that once i'm done here, not yet

[23:41:36] <Satin> Aurora_v_kosmose: mmmmmm
[23:41:48] <DaPinkOne> data science would be fun, but it's got the "don't apply without a PHD" problem
[23:41:59] <Satin> DaPinkOne: for sure, same for bioinformatics really
[23:42:01] <Jigsy> I have a pretty huge dick.
[23:42:16] <Satin> DaPinkOne: unless i want to settle for a certain level of job that i won't have much of an ability to go very high in position in

[23:42:37] <DaPinkOne> I hear some whispers of machine learning projects from the professors. maybe I could work for free one something as a resume builder
[23:42:40] <Satin> they ideally want a masters at least in biology/bioinformatics or something.
[23:42:42] <Bco1981> good
[23:42:44] <Satin> DaPinkOne: nice
[23:42:47] <emmeka> Americans get all wigged out about deep state conspiracy theories but then say things like "yeah my college is directly affiliated with the country's clandestine semi-legal intelligence agency" without batting an eye
[23:42:47] <JesseDesu> moce
[23:42:49] <JesseDesu> nice
[23:43:11] <Satin> emmeka: i'm not part of those deep state conspiracy theories
[23:43:11] <Jigsy> emmeka: Everything can be explained with "people are fucking morons."
[23:43:20] <DaPinkOne> emmeka, I'm not wigged out about deep state conspiracy. It's not a conspiracy
[23:43:22] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Yeah it's kinda disgusting.
[23:43:22] <Satin> and i have gripes with the NSA just as i do with any major big tech firm ever
[23:43:26] <JesseDesu> the CIA/NSA tries to recruit top talent from ivy leave colleges
[23:43:33] <Jigsy> "nExT The GoVErnmeNt WIll WanT TO MONiToR whAT We Do IN OUr oWn homEs. oN aNoTHEr tOPIC, My AleXA ArRIvED..."
[23:43:45] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Those assholes can go neck themselves as far as I'm concerned.
[23:43:50] <Satin> as far as i'm concerned the NSA isn't that much more "bad" as much as wwhat some of these big tech companies are doing lol
[23:43:58] <Satin> or what they're contributing to survellience tech
[23:44:00] <emmeka> Jigsy I choose to read that sentence with an intonation that suggests you're having a stroke
[23:44:05] <DaPinkOne> Jigsy, they already do that through the five eyes program
[23:44:18] <Satin> it's just that the NSA is a much larger institution obviously and more dedicated and directly engaged, and these big tech firms are indirectly involved
[23:44:18] <DaPinkOne> have for ages
[23:44:22] <Satin> but at the end of the day it just feeds into the same thing
[23:44:38] <JesseDesu> i'm going to airbrush my motorcycle helmet
[23:44:39] <Roey> Gosh Satin I love how you're *young* and not saddled with shit
[23:44:46] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Currently as far as I can see, all those organizations exist solely for the hypocritical hegemony of their lcoal elites.
[23:44:47] <Jigsy> emmeka: Nah, that's how normies talk these days.
[23:44:48] <Aurora_v_kosmose> *local
[23:44:50] <Satin> Roey: you underestimate me lol
[23:45:11] <Roey> Satin: like, I think back to when I was doing computer security in undergrad, between 1998-2003
[23:45:18] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The day they start to actually help the people, they might not qualify as "actively harmful to humanity" in my book.
[23:45:36] <Roey> Satin: I took one course on cybersecurity because that's what they had about it (I majored in computer engineering, so half CS and half EE classes)

[23:49:09] <Satin> go ahead, judge me
[23:49:10] <MootPoot> my other asus monitors dont seem to mind but they are 4k 60 instead of 4k 144 + HDR 600 ; a lot less heat /power to drive them
[23:49:24] <Bco1981> the sleep funciont is not just to save on power bill...
[23:49:29] <Bco1981> function*
[23:49:52] <Satin> my left monitor is 144hz 1080p
[23:50:00] <Satin> my middle monitor is 165hz 1080p
[23:50:05] <MootPoot> what
[23:50:08] <MootPoot> you dont even play games
[23:50:09] <Satin> my right monitor is 60hz 4k
[23:50:10] <DaPinkOne> can't see over 60fps
[23:50:14] <Satin> MootPoot: proof?
[23:50:18] <MootPoot> you said it

[23:51:11] <dfch> 144hz 1080p left, 165hz 1080p center, 60hz 4k right. dam

[23:51:33] <Satin> dfch: powered by a laptop btw, with a USB-C splitter for two displayports

[23:51:38] <DaPinkOne> Bco1981, it was a joke
[23:52:01] <dfch> desktop here all 3 are dp
[23:52:03] <Bco1981> ah, it's hard to tell who still belive that old statement
[23:52:09] <MootPoot> Bco1981: somebody needs to put these "cant see higher then 60 people" in a vr headset for an hour or two running at 30fps
[23:52:11] <DaPinkOne> the console boys often say people can't see over 60fps, 'cause consoles are always framelocked
[23:52:21] <Bco1981> MootPoot: LOL
[23:52:30] <Bco1981> 60 is bad enough
[23:52:36] <DaPinkOne> I'm still 2x 1080p, 60hz though
[23:52:41] <dfch> I actually have 4th vga to hdmi converter, but it just tail of the syslog
[23:52:43] <MootPoot> that might actually count as cruel and unusual torture if it came to it legally
[23:52:43] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Satin: I think that open development of the plasma stuff would help prevent hegemonic domination, for example.
[23:52:57] <dfch> and not even on the table
[23:53:01] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Whereas giving any malicious party advantage over everyoen else is a bad idea.
[23:53:18] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And basically all nation states count as malicious parties.
[23:53:31] <MootPoot> what about the state of MootPoot 
[23:53:59] <Satin> Aurora_v_kosmose: I don't know if they all count as malicious parties, but I get your line of reasoning.
[23:54:15] <Satin> and open development is better than closed true
[23:54:43] <Aurora_v_kosmose> In the ideal case, it'd provide countermeasures that neutralize the risk due to knowing how the thing works. Sadly... that doesn't always work.
[23:54:57] <Satin> that really doesn't work in general i'd suggest
[23:55:01] <Aurora_v_kosmose> There isn't a whole lot to do to defend against nukes even when their effects are fairly well-known.
[23:55:05] * Satin skeptical of the idea of "balancing" all the different powers in the world to prevent bad things
[23:55:42] * Satin believes that as flawed as the american led setup is, it has a far more reasonable chance at change for the better versus say a russian or chinese led one
[23:55:45] <Aurora_v_kosmose> But yeah, actively empowering malicious actors is a bad idea.
[23:55:58] <Satin> :/ we have limited options.
[23:56:13] <Satin> Aurora_v_kosmose: and they have active monopoly or whatever over this research too?
[23:56:17] <Aurora_v_kosmose> A Chinese one would collapse, I think. It requires cultural baggage that doesn't exist outside of eastern cultures.

[23:57:11] <Satin> i also deeply resent leftists nowdays who are willing to give china a pass just because it's the opposite of the US or whatever
[23:57:14] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Satin: That's another thing though, it's mostly the larger malicious actors that each have the ability to get the research first, to the detriment of everyone else.
[23:57:19] <Satin> yeah.
[23:57:47] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I'm saying mostly that Chineses culture is deeply incompatible with most of the rest of the world.
[23:58:16] * dfch staying the hell away from this discussion
