[00:14:02] <setuid> So I need to inject that ssl cert into the container when it's built and launched

[00:14:53] <DX099> rather maybe the app inside
[00:15:58] <DX099> >  inside that docker container, once launched with 'docker-compose up -d', 
[00:15:58] <DX099> are you trying to launch docker-compose inside a container?
[00:16:42] <DX099> or you have a docker compose file, you try to run it, and the software inside fails?
[00:16:49] <setuid> Nope, I launch the container on the host (where proxies are set in the active environment as well as /etc/environment), and that works, but the container that is launched, lacks the certificate _inside the container_, so anything running inside that container, can't get out
[00:17:12] <DX099> right
[00:17:30] <DX099> so yeah, you need to inject your certs in that container
[00:17:31] <setuid> So I need to alter both /etc/environment, and inject an SSL certificate into the container, and re-run 'update-ca-certificates' or equivalent, to build that cert into the default cert chain 
[00:17:58] <DX099> Docker can't automagically do that for you as SSL is handled differently depending on the distro inside the container
[00:18:08] <setuid> Why is this such a mystery? Any large enterprise using docker will have this requirement. 
[00:18:47] <DX099> it's not, you just haven't understood how large enterprise manage their container deployments with such requiremenbts
[00:18:48] <DX099> s/requiremenbts/requirements/
[00:20:15] <DX099> what you need to do is, according to the doc of the base distribution in your container, inject your PKI, update the cert stores inside, and commit your new image

[03:32:17] <addi> Trying to be succinct here, but running postgresql 13.2 on mac via docker4mac - and running my Django project's pytest testsuite generates many "psycopg2.OperationalError: FATAL:  could not open file "base/315992/1259": No such file or directory" like errors. It's not consistent across machines; doesn't happen on docker for linux that I'm aware of. What should I be looking for? This appears to be docker4mac specific.

[03:42:28] <programmerq> addi▸ without more info, I can only offer guesses. If you're using a bind mount, you may be getting a different behavior due to the filesystem sharing layer that docker for mac utilizes. Use named volumes if possible unless you need to actively work on the files from your mac and have the changes reflected immediately. for example, the postgres database data won't benefit from that file sharing
[03:42:30] <programmerq> layer, so put it in a named volume.
[03:44:41] <programmerq> if your tests are trying to connect to the database and aren't even getting that far due to a "could not open file" then it'd be helpful to try to get a python stacktrace of the failure to see what code is expecting what to happen where.

[16:40:54] <rawtaz> jsmooth: was that network created manually/outside of this compose solution? then you should add it in a top-level networks: section in the compose file and set external:true for it
[16:41:15] <jsmooth> Okay, I'll look at doing that

[16:44:13] <rawtaz> trafficjam: my main gripe (besides the rust syntax being horrible :D) is that you cannot cross-compile to other platforms/archs/OSs out of the box with rust, like you can with Go (not needing anything else)
[16:45:07] <rawtaz> riv: the problem though is that it doesnt show the entire Dockerfile :(
[16:45:50] <rawtaz> hendry: i hate that about docker hub, that you cant easily get to the corresponding Dockerfile. but i guess it's the author's fault for not providing a link to it (docker hub only gets images, they dont get the source i think). youll have to look in the corresponding github repos for it.
[16:45:52] <trafficjam> fair point, although i prefer rust syntax to go

[17:30:55] *** Joins: FunnyLookinHat (~FunnyLook@64.184.172.137)
[17:32:27] <rawtaz> not really - all you need to do is just iterate the isolate-verify loop until you narrow it down to the root cause. potentially it's your app container.
[17:32:51] *** Joins: nickdiazswag209 (~bjpenn_@98.42.87.100)
[17:32:52] <rawtaz> one though is - is the phoenix thing only listening on 127.0.0.1/localhost? make sure it listens on 0.0.0.0 inside the container
[17:33:14] <rawtaz> so in short it's all about just doing that loop and you will solve the problem. but it's hard for me to instruct you on every step
[17:33:49] <trafficjam> rawtaz: inside runtime.exs you mean?
[17:33:52] <rawtaz> i mean, it took a long time discussing the logs and i have requested them several times and i have not yet even seen the logs. i have to *drag* information out of you and it's time consuming. you're playing along somewhat but not entirely :)
[17:34:09] <rawtaz> inside whatever - the process listening on port 4000 must listen on 0.0.0.0
[17:34:21] <rawtaz> how you reach that goal is not something i know off the top of my head
[17:34:32] <trafficjam> ok, i'll keep digging :)
[17:34:55] <rawtaz> it's just a thought. it's not uncommon for people to have services listening on 127.0.0.1 and then they arent reachable by e.g. traefik. so that could be the root cause
[17:35:10] <rawtaz> you can verify easily by execing into the contianer and checking the open ports and ips
[17:36:19] <trafficjam> rawtaz: i mean if i ssh into the container, i can `wget localhost:4000/graphql` and i get a response
[17:36:49] <trafficjam> also works outside the container on the vps
[17:37:11] <rawtaz> what i said still stands - verify it

[17:38:06] <rawtaz> like i said yesterday:
[17:38:06] <rawtaz> 02:50 < rawtaz> and verifying some more, especially your theories :) no matter how silly a test seems to be - if it gets you closer to that 100% assurance that you are in control of the
[17:38:10] <rawtaz>                 isolation and debugging procedure, its usually worth it (unless you have a theory or isolation attempt where you know whats going on anyway)
[17:38:58] <rawtaz> trafficjam: i dont see how "hey, your container might be listening on just localhost, better check that" to any extent is verified by you testing if it works on localhost. thats not what you want to verify
[17:39:32] <rawtaz> how have i not been clear that what you want to verify is that the app is listening on 0.0.0.0 ??
[17:40:27] <trafficjam> sorry, the networking stuff is all a bit confusing
[17:41:39] <trafficjam> i mean im able to access the phoenix application from {127.0.0.1/localhost/0.0.0.0}:4000/graphql on both the vps and inside the phoenix container

[18:06:42] <rawtaz> ok it only appears on the ipv6 line there.. but i think that the ip stack works such that this also means it listens on ipv4, hm. does anyone else know?
[18:08:35] <rawtaz> but well, if you do forward port 4000:4000 in your docker compose file and can then connect to your *host*s ipv4 ip and port 4000 and reach the phoenix service, then that should pretty much verify that the service is indeed listening on the proper IP
[18:10:41] <rawtaz> im not sure what to tell you, you really just need to isolate this

[18:10:59] <rawtaz> verify and isolate. imagine youre the packet traveling from the browser into the container, verify every step on the way
[18:11:14] <rawtaz> thats not relevant. whats relevant is whether or not it reaches the phoenix app
[18:11:28] <rawtaz> but perhaps you mean the output/logs from the phoenix app?
[18:11:31] <trafficjam> it does, it's the phoenix app which logs it
[18:11:49] <rawtaz> ok thats good
[18:11:52] <trafficjam> docker-compose logs shows logs from the phoenix container
[18:11:55] <rawtaz> then the request reaches that :)
[18:12:15] <rawtaz> what did you test when you see that? i mean what did you connect to and from what?
[18:12:33] <trafficjam> i put '<my-ip>:4000/graphql' inside my browser
[18:12:44] <rawtaz> and what is my ip?
[18:12:49] <trafficjam> the ip of my vps
[18:12:58] <trafficjam> (IPv4 ip)
[18:13:04] <rawtaz> oh your docker stuff is on a vps on the net, not on your own local computer?
[18:13:09] <trafficjam> correct
[18:13:13] <rawtaz> thats good
[18:13:25] <rawtaz> and you currently have  ports:\n 4000:4000 in the docker compose file for that service, right?
[18:13:34] <trafficjam> yeah
[18:13:37] <rawtaz> ok good
[18:13:59] <rawtaz> i thought you had this on your local machine, but in this case then that test is definitely good enough to make sure that the phoenix app is listening properly
[18:14:34] <rawtaz> if it logs something when it gets a request then it's reacting to the request which means it got it
[18:15:20] <trafficjam> yeah the phoenix app is definitely taking requests, i think the issue is that something happens to the request between traefik and the phoenix app
[18:15:33] <rawtaz> but if you try https://my-ip/graphql, theres nothing in the phoenix logs?
[18:15:44] <trafficjam> without the :4000?
[18:15:54] <rawtaz> yeah, since you want to go through the traefik
[18:16:08] <rawtaz> https should connect to port 443
[18:16:10] <trafficjam> well i don't have a route set up for "/", so i get a 404
[18:16:54] <rawtaz> oh actually you ahve to use the hostname, duh. since thats what youre matching on in line 18 of https://dpaste.org/1CcM#L
[18:17:01] <trafficjam> yeah exactly
[18:17:17] <rawtaz> so https://app.mydomain.com/graphql - does that not make phoenix react at all?

[18:18:05] <trafficjam> let me check, one moment. I removed - traefik.enable=true and put the whoami service in, so when accessing app.mydomain.com, it returns that whoami info
[18:18:12] <trafficjam> i'll just remove it
[18:18:27] <rawtaz> please try that url first with the whoami still in place :)
[18:18:42] <rawtaz> so you know that if you request that url you come to the right container and the right port (Temporarily set to 80 in the loadbalancer)
[18:18:58] <rawtaz> once you established that, switch back to the 4000 port in the loadbalancer setting and also the phoenix image instead
[18:19:03] <trafficjam> should i remove Host(`app.mydomain.com`) from the whoami service then?
[18:19:27] <rawtaz> no thats what youre testing with so let it be there
[18:19:56] <rawtaz> yesterday you just replaced the image from your app one to the whoami one, and changed  traefik.http.services.app.loadbalancer.server.port=4000  to  traefik.http.services.app.loadbalancer.server.port=80
[18:20:23] <rawtaz> keep it that way, make sure you get the whois when accessing https://app.mydomain.com/ , then once thats established change back the image and port setting

[18:54:42] <peac> hey, i need to create a docker image where two programs using different versions of python are executed. I know it's not the way containers should be used but they need to share a unix socket and have other constraints that let me with this as the best option. I'm creating a multistage image that first installs the first app, then the second, and lastly brings everything in the release container. 
[18:54:44] <peac> I'm using virtualenv to keep the dependencies together with each program, but afaiu virtualenv will not package python itself in its directory. Then there's pyenv which is there to install the right python version, but has a bunch of dependencies that are unwanted in the final image. How should I approach this ?

[19:09:42] <trafficjam> does traefik.enable need to be true?
[19:09:49] <rawtaz> when you do that request, does traefik itself log it?

[21:56:16] <Flash> rawtaz: I think our time difference is losing context. For the same reason that one might use an ARG to specify a source (so at build time, you can select an image), the --from of the COPY should be defininable at build time

[22:07:01] <rawtaz> Flash: i still dont get it. the --from argument is for referencing another part of the same Dockerfile, and that part as far as i understand it doesnt have to be dynamically named. so in other words, why do you need to dynamically name the value of the --from argument? why cant you just have a static value there?

[23:00:38] <entropygain> hey all is there a way to run docker engine on windows 10 without Docker Desktop? I was looking at the binaries for docker daemon and docker .. but those just allow me to run windows only containers
[23:01:07] <entropygain> wonder if there is a better solution or the magic only comes from Docker Desktop and thus why you now should move to a subscription
[23:01:22] <DoofusCanadensis> windows server maybe
[23:01:27] <ikke> entropygain: wsl2
[23:01:27] <entropygain> (i only use docker cli and never really touch the Desktop)
[23:01:30] <DoofusCanadensis> on windows 10/11, wsl2
[23:01:32] <entropygain> wsl2 has messy networking
[23:01:43] <DoofusCanadensis> then wsl1
[23:01:44] <entropygain> DoofusCanadensis: you mean try the windows server instructions?
[23:01:52] <entropygain> :/
[23:02:02] <entropygain> maybe i just learn better wsl2 and create better routing rules or something
[23:02:04] <DoofusCanadensis> windows server 2016+ supports windows containers
[23:02:13] <DoofusCanadensis> nah, I've run into the wsl2 networking myself
[23:02:24] <DoofusCanadensis> had to swich my docker vm to use wsl1 instead
[23:02:26] <entropygain> onet ime i went down the road
[23:02:30] <entropygain> and partially was successful
[23:02:36] <entropygain> but it was partial
[23:02:46] <entropygain> i think i got it where i can access thigns from 1 way but not hte other or somethign weird
[23:02:52] <entropygain> maybe that is the answer
[23:03:00] <entropygain> i just know wsl2 has so many other benefits
[23:03:05] <DoofusCanadensis> of course
[23:03:17] <DoofusCanadensis> but you can run wsl1 and wsl2 vms at the same time
[23:03:41] <DoofusCanadensis> and maybe Microsoft will fix the wsl2 networking
[23:04:29] <DoofusCanadensis> I've got a request in for a linux docker host and a windows server 2019 docker host to be set up in IT's lab
[23:04:37] <DoofusCanadensis> so I'll get a chance to play with things more
