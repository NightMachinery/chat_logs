[01:41:29] <fritzwastaken> Me and my wife went for a walk yesertday, there were a bunch of kids walking around in costumes
[01:41:34] <Activ8> Since the energy prices are set to get higher 
[01:41:38] <GobbleGibby> Data centers usually use a broker with the provider and the delivery company to get really low rates

[01:43:10] <Activ8> you would hope data centers have priced it right lol
[01:43:40] <GobbleGibby> They absolutely do. And the rates are usually locked for absurdly cheap rates for an equally absurd amount of time
[01:44:51] <GobbleGibby> However, they usually pass along the average retail kilowatt hour pricing to the Colo tenants
[01:45:37] <Activ8> Holy shit there‚Äôs a report that Apple might be bringing crash detection in 2022 auto dialing 911

[01:55:52] <riff-IRC> it's amazing what burning x86 down can do
[01:57:19] <riff-IRC> back in the 90s when the Motorola 68K CPUs had a good foothold, we offered alternative control systems based around those CPUs
[01:58:52] <riff-IRC> when compared to its x86 counterpart, the m68k CPUs were able to bring a system of 5 generators + 2 utility feeds into sync in about 30% less time than x86 counterparts
[01:59:01] <Activ8> Won‚Äôt be long and x86 won‚Äôt exist in new tech
[01:59:06] <riff-IRC> yep
[01:59:07] <Activ8> its happening
[01:59:17] *** Joins: SpeakerToMeat (~Speaker@user/speakertomeat)
[01:59:45] <riff-IRC> we also forced module vendors to develop modules for m68k in addition to x86
[02:02:13] <GobbleGibby> THIS IS THE YEAR OF LINUX
[02:02:26] <riff-IRC> some modules, such as LPI Electrical's 'lpirmswgctrl' module (which was YUUGE, 35MB of compiled code), ran up to 40% faster on non-x86 CPUs since instead of using special-purpose instructions and registers, we could take advantage of generalized instructions and use very tight loops to create virtual instructions, which could then be called upon when needed

[02:44:52] <javi404> I need to make sure I'm not crazy
[02:44:57] <Cl0udNinja> notice me vsanpai
[02:45:07] <javi404> hola Cl0udNinja
[02:45:16] <Cl0udNinja> sup
[02:45:22] <javi404> I am thinking I have 2 nodes, 12 bays.
[02:45:59] <javi404> 3 disk groups each node, 1 nvme cache each disk group, 3 storage disks per disk group.
[02:46:11] <javi404> make sense should survive a disk failure on a single node?
[02:46:28] <javi404> some raid5sh policy applied?
[02:47:18] <javi404> doing a stretch cluster across 2 buildings is the plan, to survive a building failure.
[02:47:31] <riff-IRC> are you using enterprise grade storage for the NVMe cache?
[02:47:55] <javi404> riff-IRC: ill see what Dell/EMC/Vmware proposes, going with VXrail hardware.
[02:48:01] <riff-IRC> because that caching will absolutely tear up NAND like crazy
[02:48:04] <javi404> everything enterprize.
[02:48:12] <javi404> riff-IRC: maybe that is why they proposed SSD
[02:48:16] <javi404> as of now it is all SSD
[02:48:16] * riff-IRC nods
[02:48:26] <javi404> scratch nvme then
[02:48:54] <riff-IRC> if you're going with SSDs as main storage, WATCH OUT- SSDs will self-erase over time if left powered down
[02:48:57] <javi404> i saw you can only have a max of 1cache, 8 data per disk group, but if a disk group has a single disk failure, aren't i shit out of luck then?
[02:49:15] <javi404> this is 24/7/365
[02:49:19] <riff-IRC> You can use NVMe caching, just use an enterprise-grade disk

[02:49:32] <sd> 03<H‚ÄãurdyGurdyBurdy> i wouldn't think that'd be an issue for servers, unless there's a massive outage
[02:49:42] <sd> 03<H‚ÄãurdyGurdyBurdy> ssd's self-erasing, that is
[02:50:33] <javi404> the SSDs come to 7.8GB usable so I assume 200MB is all for failed cells etc. it's all enterprise gear being proposed.
[02:50:54] <javi404> but my question is will 3 storage groups per host give me the redundancy I am looking for.
[02:51:08] <javi404> I saw something on youtube about ddup being an issue
[02:51:13] <javi404> but what if we don't dedup
[02:51:15] <sd> 03<H‚ÄãurdyGurdyBurdy> what's your redundancy goal?
[02:51:32] <javi404> sd, survive disk failure, survive building failure.

[02:53:19] <javi404> I just know that what it seems like is if you have a failure in a disk group, the whole disk group fails.

[02:55:01] <Cl0udNinja> javi404, theres ways to help mitigate that. use disks with different serial number ranges / disks with different mfg dates. and dont use raid5-like unless you have no choice
[02:55:03] <javi404> big money involved.
[02:55:47] <javi404> yeah i mean at the storage layer, i want some kind of redundancy, whatever vsan can do, and hardware is all the usuall dual power supplies and feeds and whatnot.
[02:55:55] <javi404> network is already insane redundant.
[02:56:16] <javi404> if a building MDF failes, other IDF can to to the second building. etc.

[10:17:31] <SirSceptalot> You're the rudest doctor I know.
[10:17:35] <DrZak> i should start working
[10:17:57] <DrZak> but, i am incompetent too, so nobody has high expectations
[10:18:14] <DrZak> SirSceptalot: lol you must've been very healthy and not live in post commie country
[10:18:41] <SirSceptalot> Actually, that's pretty much spot on.
[10:19:19] <SirSceptalot> Last time I went to a doctor they asked me who my regular md was. I told them, to which they replied "didn't he die like 5 years ago?"
[10:19:23] <DrZak> i actually have seen a 45y woman in ER go and tell a nurse 'i think i have a heart attack' and the reply was "wait your turn please"

[10:20:16] <DrZak> yep, she did have one
[10:20:17] <DrZak> :))
[10:20:21] <SirSceptalot> You see comrade, in soviet russia, heart attacks have you. But only on schedule.
[10:20:24] <DrZak> as it turns out 15 minutes later
[10:20:48] <DrZak> that was the moment they realized that it would be too much fuss and started moving quickly
[10:21:47] <SirSceptalot> lol, so they finally treated her to avoid paperwork of a deceased patient?
[10:22:18] <Cl0udNinja> sounds about right for the american medical system
[10:22:49] <DrZak> yea
[10:25:16] <Cl0udNinja> what kills me the most is that doctors get paid an -insane- amount, and we get charged an even more insane amount, and we see them for all of 5 minutes if you're lucky, otherwise its all nurses doing 90% of the work
[10:25:44] <DrZak> yea, but if i understand it correctly, they get shit in return
[10:25:54] <DrZak> as a lot of it goes to various admin / legal shit 
[10:26:06] <Cl0udNinja> and then of course theres shit like my doctor for my knee, who saw me for 2 minutes, sent me for an MRI, and then ghosted me after they got the money from the referral for sending me for an MRI

[10:30:55] <SirSceptalot> A while ago my wife and I both went to the same doctor. (Motorcycle fall had us both with painful limbs. We were in there for a good half hour, taking his time for each of us. In the end he adviced us both to just go see a physiotherapist as nothing seems torn or broken. He then took time to find a good physio near us that he trusted or knew was solid. We paid ‚Ç¨13 in total
[10:31:29] <SirSceptalot> Wife still had a question she forgot to ask when we came home. She called the office, he picked up and spent a few more minutes on the phone with he, no charge or grumbles

[10:42:12] <SirSceptalot> they'd probably get you faster help in case of a heart attack than that ER DrZak was talking about
[10:42:46] <DrZak> oh ye, at least that AED gimmick is right there at the counter
[10:43:20] <SirSceptalot> Fortunately I never needed to use one. Is there a reason why you call them a gimmick?
[10:44:41] <DrZak> yet
[10:45:44] <SirSceptalot> True, not yet. I hope I can keep it that way.
[10:45:55] <DrZak> hmm, its a gadget, device, gimmick
[10:45:56] <DrZak> no?
[10:46:13] <csws> gimmick implies it has no real purpose

[10:48:33] <csws> the ones I've seen in pubic say you have to call 000 and get a code to unlock it
[10:48:37] <csws> I guess that'll at least filter out some bad behaviour
[10:48:39] <SirSceptalot> A moron with an AED probably isn't great, but it's better than nothing
[10:48:54] <DrZak> i would be more worreid about them being kept in good working order, i assuem like fire extinguishers they need to be checked and replaced regulary

[12:58:53] <Activ8> they won't have roles there will be a test account in there I'm sure
[12:58:59] <Activ8> owners usually don't have roles
[13:00:42] <sd> 08<L‚Äãancehead> "Roles" on discord work a little differently. You have a big member list with online people on the side
[13:00:55] <sd> 08<L‚Äãancehead> And you can categorize them with roles

[13:01:25] <sd> 08<L‚Äãancehead> Usually when you make a server it makes a separate role for the server owner so they're always at the top of the list
[13:01:44] <sd> 08<L‚Äãancehead> But that doesn't seem to be the case here, so the server owner is just buried somewhere among the other members lol

[13:21:35] <nobyk> What's wrong with it
[13:21:35] <sd> 08<L‚Äãancehead> nah, latest debian
[13:21:40] <nobyk> 11 ?
[13:21:56] <sd> 08<L‚Äãancehead> Yeppers. It freezes whenever I resize windows once or twice
[13:21:56] <SirSceptalot> Sorry Ray, I don't use git myself. Best advice I can give you is to shoot an e-mail to github
[13:21:58] <nobyk> Bullseye
[13:22:04] <nobyk> weird
[13:22:15] <Activ8> ray you might want to go ask in the #git channel.  I know your on discord but you might be best joining irc to go ask in there.
[13:22:43] <sd> 08<L‚Äãancehead> Yeah, it's odd. My laptop isn't the best but it should be able to handle a debian VM lmao
[13:22:56] <sd> 08<L‚Äãancehead> I have a 940MX in this thing and am giving it 6gb RAM
[13:23:24] <nobyk> The VM runs on your laptop?
[13:23:32] <sd> 08<L‚Äãancehead> Yeah
[13:23:44] <nobyk> Why not run the IRC client on your laptop OS
[13:23:52] <nobyk> I'm not judging, just asking
[13:24:08] <sd> 08<L‚Äãancehead> I like using a CLI client so people can't tell I'm just chatting at work lol
[13:24:18] <sd> 08<L‚Äãancehead> Dunno how to set one up for win10
[13:24:26] <nobyk> WSL may work
[13:24:56] <nobyk> Is your CLI client irssi ?
[13:25:01] <sd> 08<L‚Äãancehead> WeeChat currently
[13:25:42] <sd> 08<L‚Äãancehead> Hmm, how exactly does WSL function?
[13:26:04] <nobyk> uhm
[13:26:06] <SirSceptalot> magic
[13:26:09] <nobyk> Well you install it, with a distro
[13:26:14] <Activ8> lancehead you know the lounge chat runs on windows right?
[13:26:28] <Activ8> you just need to install nodejs/git and yarn (depends which way you install it)
[13:26:36] <nobyk> eg Debian. And then you start it and you have a Debian (probably bash) shell
[13:26:42] <nobyk> it's like a VM
[13:26:44] <sd> 08<L‚Äãancehead> WSL sounds kinda nice to have either way...
[13:26:54] <sd> 08<L‚Äãancehead> Okay, so it doesn't do bootloader nonsense?
[13:26:58] <sd> 13<C‚Äãolour> Why does Teams have to create some weird shared item thing in Teams when I upload why can't I just give them a bloody file
[13:26:59] <nobyk> New WSL versions support GUI apps
[13:27:02] <Activ8> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMsqfjXBp0s
[13:27:09] <nobyk> But if you only want CLI, shouldn't be a problem
[13:27:10] <xe0n> because it's onedrive?
[13:27:11] <Activ8> I did a video of a script I wrote in action installing the lounge
[13:27:25] <nobyk> You may want to use WSL2, but if that doesn't work (like for me) you can use WSL1
[13:27:25] <Activ8> batch script for installing the lounge client on windows
[13:27:32] <sd> 08<L‚Äãancehead> Activ8, the lounge is a graphical client no?
[13:27:35] <sd> 08<L‚Äãancehead> I'll try WSL
[13:27:41] <Activ8> it's a graphical client yes
[13:27:45] <nobyk> if I use WSL2, the thing doesn't have any network
[13:27:48] <sd> 08<L‚Äãancehead> Yeah I need a CLI client
[13:27:48] <Activ8> but you can theme it with css 
[13:27:52] <nobyk> but WSL1 works fine for what I need it for
[13:28:00] <Activ8> I'll build a CLI interface theme for it
[13:28:10] <Activ8> so it looks like command prompt or bash lol
[13:28:34] <Activ8> there isn't one at the moment but I could code it
[13:28:46] <sd> 08<L‚Äãancehead> Nahh don't worry. I'll try some other stuff first
[13:29:09] <sd> 08<L‚Äãancehead> Going to try what nobyk suggested. WSL seems nice to have
[13:29:12] <nobyk> I think the command is like, WSL --install -d Debian
[13:29:16] <sd> 08<L‚Äãancehead> (Thank you though!)
[13:29:35] <sd> 08<L‚Äãancehead> I just went with the default Ubuntu, I don't really mind

[13:32:55] <sd> 08<L‚Äãancehead> I'm going to start using this on my desktop instead of dual booting lol
[13:33:04] <SirSceptalot> it's an abbreviation, so maybe that's why
[13:33:11] <sd> 08<L‚Äãancehead> True, true
[13:33:15] <sd> 08<L‚Äãancehead> lol
[13:39:28] <sd> 08<L‚Äãancehead> Hm, can you run multiple instances of WSL at the same time?
[13:39:32] <sd> 08<L‚Äãancehead> @ nobyk
[13:40:34] <Activ8> WSL is just the layer that talks to the os
[13:40:50] <Activ8> you mean multiple systems like debian / ubuntu / centos e.t.c
[13:40:57] <sd> 08<L‚Äãancehead> Yeah, I do. My bad
[13:41:01] <Activ8> then yes you can
[13:41:04] <sd> 08<L‚Äãancehead> Awesome
[13:41:05] <Activ8> look in the app store
[13:41:14] <SirSceptalot> I think windows can (try to) force a second instance of whatever application by holding ctrl when opening the application
[13:41:16] <Activ8> there's many many many layers now you can throw on top of the os
[13:41:23] <sd> 08<L‚Äãancehead> woo!
[13:41:31] <thegodsquirrel> Yeah, you can open multiple Ubuntu terminals @ LanceHead
[13:41:39] <xe0n> windows terminal
[13:41:44] <Activ8> or you can run docker with another set of layers inside that as well
[13:41:48] <sd> 08<L‚Äãancehead> With just one install? @ thegodsquirrel
[13:42:02] <thegodsquirrel> Yeah, I just tried it
[13:42:07] <sd> 08<L‚Äãancehead> Awesome
[13:42:19] <thegodsquirrel> Right click on the icon and click the Ubuntu * again
[13:43:07] <nobyk> Yes you can
[13:43:11] <nobyk> can also to tmux

[13:47:28] <lancehead> Lol jesus f4ll3n 
[13:47:44] <teh_f4ll3n> why not use hex or philips?
[13:47:54] <lancehead> Apple doesn't exercise right to repair. They exercise right to go fuck yourself. That's why 
[13:47:59] <teh_f4ll3n> why be awkward cunts?
[13:47:59] * DoTheNeedful throws punches
[13:48:00] <thegodsquirrel> why not have the tool?  ;-)
[13:48:03] <xe0n> their new machines are much better
[13:48:07] <xe0n> and have scored a decent rating
[13:48:19] <teh_f4ll3n> because I don't work on macs
[13:48:45] <teh_f4ll3n> and macs are pretty much the only company that use pentalobe heads
[13:48:54] <lancehead> What the hell is a pentalobe 
[13:49:02] <teh_f4ll3n> a mac screw
[13:49:14] <SirSceptalot> I agree with lancehead
[13:49:15] <lancehead> Oh what the heck 
[13:49:35] <SirSceptalot> oh it's kinda like a fat torx
[13:49:42] <lancehead> Just hammer an allen key in there. Easy fix 
[13:49:55] <teh_f4ll3n> at least it was an m.2 drive, not soldered onto the logic board
[13:49:56] <thegodsquirrel> Never work on an iMac, getting the screen off on the old ones... yikes, newer ones were magnetic
[13:50:16] <lancehead> Oh yeh I know, my dad has an old one. They're awful to take apart 
[13:50:35] <Activ8> I used to repair them
[13:50:41] <lancehead> I don't envy you 
[13:50:50] <SirSceptalot> they should just skip the pretend and use screws that are actually shaped like the apple logo
[13:50:52] <Activ8> once you done a few it gets easier
[13:50:56] <Activ8> there's tools available
[13:50:58] <lancehead> lol sceptalot 
[13:51:15] <Activ8> SirSceptalot I am actually surprised they haven't done that.
[13:51:21] <Activ8> apple shaped screw heads
[13:51:21] <lancehead> Screws shaped like steve jobs' head, including protruding features 
[13:51:23] <SirSceptalot> and instead of using M2, M2.5 or M3 thread, just invent a new thread
[13:51:35] <lancehead> So you need a screwdriver with steve jobs' face on the end 
[13:51:48] <thegodsquirrel> Its a Tim.4
[13:51:52] <lancehead> Oh jesus 
[13:51:53] <SirSceptalot> LOL
[13:51:56] <SirSceptalot> Tim.4
[13:52:01] <SirSceptalot> brilliant
[13:52:26] <lancehead> Instead of M2 we get "iM2" 
[13:52:30] <Activ8> I might suggest that to apple lol
[13:52:42] <teh_f4ll3n> Tim.3, Tim.2, Tim.1, and Tim.0 in the set

[13:54:29] <teh_f4ll3n> PrincessZoey got one yesterday
[13:54:42] <lancehead> @teh_f4ll3n, I actually had that happen while trying to unscrew the screw on my laptop's mini-sata. I accidentally slid over it ONCE and it was just circular 
[13:54:57] <thegodsquirrel> I've had an OG M1 MBA and its been great, installing iOS apps was nice
[13:55:02] <lancehead> Which led to me not being able to mount the hard drive caddy I bought :( 
[13:55:15] <teh_f4ll3n> oof
[13:55:23] <lancehead> Because for SOME reason my laptop comes with a dummy DVD drive 
[13:55:43] <teh_f4ll3n> because actual drive costs extra
[13:55:45] <lancehead> Which I ended up drilling holes into and gluing the circuit board from said caddy inside of 
[13:56:08] <lancehead> It fits, it works, and I'm MacGyver
[13:56:22] <thegodsquirrel> hackerman.gif
[13:56:39] <Activ8> the m1 chip is a beast
[13:56:45] <Activ8> apple have really done well with that 
[13:56:57] <lancehead> The entire process was jarring as hell but I have an extra TB of storage now xD 
[13:57:10] <SirSceptalot> lol @ "MACgyver"
[13:57:29] <teh_f4ll3n> until we find out that the new M1 machines have a critical design flaw that only becomes apparent with use
[13:58:09] <xe0n> m1 is nice, m1 pro\max even better :D
[13:58:15] <lancehead> SirSceptalot, you should've seen what I did in there. I had to exacto knife several holes into the crappy plastic dummy drive they have in there so I could fit the circuit board and my HDD in there 
[13:58:15] <SirSceptalot> found the flaw, it has iOS on it
[13:58:33] <thegodsquirrel> my M1 is a meme machine, so it is over-powered
[13:58:42] <lancehead> Surprisingly good fit overall though 
[13:59:05] <teh_f4ll3n> hot glue the lot
[13:59:36] <lancehead> I hot glued the board in there, made actual screw holes for the HDD. I managed to turn it into a proper drive bay lol

[14:00:06] <lancehead> It's actually kinda nice, I can undo one screw and just replace the drive whenever I want because it pulls out the side now :D

[14:51:19] <xe0n> aww
[14:51:21] <Activ8> then lancehead you need a micro server
[14:51:39] <Activ8> I purchased a lenovo m93p for ¬£70
[14:51:46] <Activ8> that had 8gb ram and ssd
[14:51:52] <thegodsquirrel> or an RPi 4
[14:52:07] <xe0n> i think the idea is he keeps his power bill down
[14:52:08] <xe0n> lol
[14:52:08] <Activ8> there's that but a little bit more power just use something like that
[14:52:11] <xe0n> not add more computers lol
[14:52:22] <Activ8> then get a free vps
[14:52:24] <Activ8> sorted
[14:52:31] <DrZak> man, this gfx card crunch is sorta getting annoying
[14:52:49] <Activ8> Google VPS or Amazon VPS free tier
[14:53:55] <thegodsquirrel> After free tier, ec2 t2.nano Ubuntu server, ~$4 a month

[14:55:31] <Activ8> mhm
[14:56:00] <Activ8> over 12 months that could be $48 so might be the cheaper option over a local box
[14:56:20] <Activ8> the free tier will probably work for the first year
[14:56:29] <thegodsquirrel> No heat, no power draw locally
[14:56:40] <thegodsquirrel> Yup that's exactly what I did
[14:56:56] <thegodsquirrel> And I set limits to never go over $7
[14:56:57] <Activ8> yeh
[14:57:07] <Activ8> I used free tier for 2 years
[14:57:12] <Activ8> didn't cost a penny

[15:07:41] <SirSceptalot> Do you need it at random times, or more or less the same time?
[15:08:11] <SirSceptalot> as low-tech as it is, if you need it on at more or lex fixed times you can just set it when to boot in the bios
[15:09:39] <Activ8> do you have a laptop?
[15:09:44] <Activ8> just run it from localhost then
[15:09:58] <Activ8> Google VPS / Amazon VPS is free on their FREE tier.

[16:46:01] <lancehead> So whenever we both work we spend like an hour together that day 
[16:46:04] <javi404> csws: vsan is what is driving me nuts.
[16:46:09] <sd> 04<F‚ÄãeralTerminator> I could work 6 days a week but I dont wanna
[16:46:10] <lancehead> Cause she has late shifts 
[16:46:14] <csws> javi404, one weird limitation on 2 node is at the time you couldn't plug the vsan NICs into a switch.. they were literally point to point
[16:46:15] <csws> weird as hell
[16:46:27] <csws> 3 node doesn't have this
[16:46:33] <csws> for obvious reasons I guess.
[16:46:48] <csws> oh man
[16:46:49] <javi404> csws: we are looking to do stretch cluster between 2 buildings.
[16:46:55] <csws> dell guys aren't very upfront but make sure you account for vsan overheads too
[16:47:01] <csws> on about 100TB of storage that was like 100GB of RAM down the drain
[16:47:03] <csws> dell guys had no clue
[16:47:10] <javi404> csws: fuck
[16:48:33] <csws> https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2113954
[16:48:37] <csws> this is making my head hurt
[16:48:46] <javi404> csws: that is what I am getting, vague answers from dell makes me uncomfortable, we are going with like 1 or 1.5TB ram I think, each node 62TB raw SSD + cache drives.
[16:48:46] <csws> we were all flash
[16:48:56] <javi404> that is my plan
[16:48:56] <csws> damn
[16:49:07] <csws> we had 576 GB of RAM
[16:49:12] <javi404> hence you can see im doing my homework here.
[16:49:20] <csws> but there was a plan to bump that as we didn't even have n-1 redundancy the architecture was so fucked
[16:49:20] <javi404> VSAN is my confusion at the moment.
[16:49:26] <csws> not dell's fault though.. guy who originally planned it screwed up
[16:49:48] <csws> we also had a 4th host that was a standalone vsphere running DDVE for backups
[16:49:51] <javi404> same here, im corossing the T and dotting the i s before I sign off on this shit.
[16:49:59] *** Joins: tg (~tg@rockylinux/infra/tg)
[16:50:17] <javi404> csws: if you do dedup and compression, if you loose a disk, disk group goes down, but do the vms keep running?
[16:50:26] <javi404> this question I can't seem to find an answer to.
[16:50:47] <javi404> we have 4x 10Gbit links planned between buildings for this cluster.
[16:51:29] <javi404> I know there is no such thing as any kind of raid in a disk group
[16:51:35] <csws> christ I can't even remember if we did dedupe and compression

[16:51:44] <csws> this guy hopefully has some keywords for you
[16:52:27] <javi404> im gonna see if they can get a VSAN expert on the call and not someone just trying to sell me hardware.
[16:52:47] <csws> yeah
[16:52:53] <csws> did you get the crazy macro sheet yet?
[16:53:07] <javi404> I got a powerpoint with typose
[16:53:16] <csws> they send out this xlsm when preparing the config and it got nailed by ATP first try
[16:53:18] <javi404> we need to figure out where to put the witness node.
[16:53:40] <csws> iirc you can have that anywhere as long as it's <400 ms RTT
[16:53:49] <csws> since we were setting up one perth to connect to a cluster in brazil.. was kinda jokes

[16:57:18] <csws> tbh I do have a box with 16 drives for ZFS
[16:57:28] <csws> and there's a 4TB drive in the CCTV box.. but I think that's it for HDDs
[16:57:34] <sd> 05<v‚Äãyz> it was only found out when i saw someone running crystaldiskinfo and had a bad seagate drive brand new

[16:59:04] <csws> man when I had the 40 drive array chugging I was having all sorts of issues with the toshiba drives
[16:59:08] <csws> just dropping off like flies.
[16:59:10] <lancehead> -sintax, probably 
[16:59:14] <csws> for every 4 toshibas that'd die you'd maybe get one seagate

[16:59:21] <sintax> lancehead: lol
[16:59:30] <sintax> the only problem is their health insurance suckd.
[16:59:34] <sintax> and that hasn't changed. 
[16:59:35] <javi404> csws: thanks for that, yeah, i think we have some locations near by that will work.

[17:00:03] <lancehead> next* 
[17:00:17] <csws> they'll probably just bring a vmware guy in
[17:00:21] <csws> do you have a relationship with vmware directly?
[17:00:24] <lancehead> Oh, oh, abreviation! 
[17:00:46] <javi404> yeah, that is what I am going to ask for csws
[17:01:06] <csws> my memory is turning to dust after a year but I recall we got a vmware engineer after some complaining
[17:01:14] <csws> tbf
[17:01:17] <csws> vxrail once it's running.. it is good
[17:01:17] <lancehead> javi404: ZFS - Zeus Fucking South Africans?
[17:01:25] <javi404> lol
[17:01:27] <csws> we never had hardware issues and the hardware is easy to work with. BIOS isn't locked down or anything
[17:01:37] <csws> we had to shove fibre channel cards in due to another migration fuckup and it was really easy
[17:02:01] <javi404> yeah, we are probably going with a 2u chassis on each end.
[17:02:07] <csws> it's basically an r740 with a fancy badge
[17:02:19] <javi404> so future, we can expand storage, and if we need more compute, 2x more nodes.
[17:02:24] <javi404> csws: what I figured.
[17:02:37] <csws> dell guys came out and racked it all for us as we're lazy shits too
[17:02:41] <csws> even did cable management arms and whatnot
[17:02:47] <javi404> csws: nice
[17:02:50] <lancehead> Dell yeah!
[17:02:51] <javi404> we will do that
[17:02:56] <csws> lol
[17:03:01] <csws> they did a good job to their credit
[17:03:09] <javi404> csws: trying to keep their jobs
[17:03:14] <csws> they even put strain relief on the AC cords
[17:03:15] <javi404> everything is moving to cloud 
[17:03:24] <javi404> that is what we need im sure

[17:29:46] <lancehead> both/and 
[17:30:03] <lancehead> so using SSH keys as well as 2FA to open an SSH session 
[17:30:31] <csws> lancehead, do you get hardware accelerated crypto with Pis? can you use LUKS or something?
[17:30:37] <csws> imo encrypt the filesystem too
[17:30:41] <csws> oh also
[17:30:43] <csws> yubikeys!
[17:30:45] <csws> for the SSH
[17:30:47] <lancehead> Yeah I was planning to do that 
[17:30:47] <csws> that'd be cool
[17:30:55] <lancehead> The encryption, that is 
[17:31:08] <lancehead> As well as change default SSH ports and setup a ban after a certain amount of failed tries 
[17:31:29] <lancehead> I think I might just setup said ban and keys, not 2FA 
[17:31:57] <csws> going to use fail2ban for that?
[17:31:57] <lancehead> If you have to guess a 32-char password and a 2048-char private key and you get locked out for 10 minutes every 5 tries, it'll take a few weeks lol

[17:33:46] <lancehead> Yep! Was planning on that 
[17:33:57] <lancehead> And sintax, I'm going to setup SSH keys and fail2ban I think

[23:08:53] <bloody> ive tried those little heat pads
[23:09:07] <bloody> theyre nice but 1 time use
[23:09:13] <sintax> correct
[23:09:13] <bloody> https://www.thewarmingstore.com/heated-balaclava.html this actually looks goated
[23:10:13] <bloody> i wonder if they use that kind of equipment on mt everest
[23:12:53] <sintax> probably not to save weight i bet
[23:13:27] <Activ8> When I was a kid I used to have a pocket warmer.  You purchased stick type items to light and it was like charcoal but wasn't.  Lasted 12 hours
[23:14:13] <mistiry> i always used Hot Hands
[23:14:28] <mistiry> little packs of iron powder that oxidate and release heat slowly over 8 or so hours
[23:14:40] <mistiry> stick em in your pocketes, gloves, socks, etc.
[23:14:47] <mistiry> but, one time use
[23:15:02] <mistiry> https://hothands.com/
