[19:15:13] <headius> morning folks
[19:17:09] <basshelal[m]> Morning ðŸ˜Š
[19:31:45] <headius> enebo: https://github.com/ruby/fileutils/issues/59
[19:32:00] <headius> ruby-core will discuss fileutils being out of sync on Thursday
[19:32:13] <headius> not sure if we want to wait for that or just ship with a newer released version
[19:32:30] <enebo[m]> hmm
[19:34:11] <enebo[m]> I don't really see the harm in shipping the newer version for a .0 especially since it will likely be that version soon for them anyways
[19:34:23] <headius> my plan for early this week is to start putting together release notes
[19:34:33] <enebo[m]> If there is an issue we will just have to revert or fix upstream and push forward
[19:34:44] <headius> yeah I agree
[19:34:58] <enebo[m]> I will make some bits this morning just to see how we are doing
[19:46:50] *** Joins: NoraHoward[m] (~baroquebo@2001:470:69fc:105::f6ff)
[19:47:26] <headius> enebo: we should do some verification using the snapshot builds of maven artifacts too... at a glance jruby-base looks ok but it is a new artifact and we have not tried to use it for anything ourselves: https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/jruby/jruby-base/9.3.0.0-SNAPSHOT/
[19:50:15] <headius> baroquebobcat might stop by today with some JI issues he's having (9.2.19)
[19:50:20] <headius> in case I step away
[20:20:35] <enebo[m]> headius: sonatype is failing because jruby-core now no longer attaches sources
[20:20:50] <headius> wat
[20:21:33] <enebo[m]> https://gist.github.com/enebo/17ac31f0e2a9881e5b782f090d4028d8
[20:25:38] <headius> not in the snapshots either: https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/jruby/jruby-complete/9.3.0.0-SNAPSHOT/
[20:25:44] <headius> they are there for other artifacts though
[20:26:09] <headius> oops, not there for core either
[20:26:14] <headius> they are there for base
[20:26:31] <headius> not there for stdlib
[20:26:40] <headius> only base seems to have the javadocs in 9.3
[20:27:07] <enebo[m]> well I have not hit a problem with that yet but complete is pretty far down in the process
[20:27:13] <enebo[m]> that = docs
[20:27:53] <enebo[m]> looks like shaded/pom is for core now and it looks like it only runs shade unless somehow the inherit takes care of more?
[20:28:25] <headius> complete and stdlib in the 9.2.20 snapshots don't have javadocs either
[20:28:38] <headius> shaded is core now, yes, and the "core" dir is just the base jar
[20:32:12] <enebo[m]> this is about sources and not javadocs
[20:32:21] <headius> oh oops
[20:32:33] <enebo[m]> ok I thought you found a second problem :)
[20:32:48] <enebo[m]> This is weird to me since core is a shaded base
[20:33:06] <enebo[m]>                    createSourcesJar: '${create.sources.jar}',
[20:33:13] <headius> yeah only base and stdlib should need the sources
[20:33:16] <enebo[m]> I see that within shade but I don't really maven
[20:33:37] <headius> no sources in 9.2.20 complete jar either
[20:33:39] <headius> snapshot
[20:33:41] <enebo[m]> complete depends on core so I guess it feels it should have sources
[20:34:05] <enebo[m]> but do we have an artifact that depends on complete pushed to sonatype?
[20:34:41] <headius> 9.3 base has sources but stdlib does not
[20:35:00] <headius> 9.2.20 snap stdlib has sources
[20:35:09] <headius> perhaps it is a transitive problem?
[20:35:27] <headius> I don't know if it detects that all shaded resources have sources or what
[20:35:54] <enebo[m]> so complete sees core is shaded and then asks for sources?
[20:36:04] <headius> complete 9.2.19 does have sources in central: https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/jruby/jruby-complete/9.2.19.0/
[20:36:40] <enebo[m]> and core definitely did before base was made and it was also shaded before
[20:36:48] <headius> something may have gotten tweaked that broke publishing sources in 9.2.20 and that got merged to master
[20:37:13] <enebo[m]> I could try 9.2.20 and confirm it is broken
[20:37:25] <enebo[m]> That would lead us aware from jruby-base being involved
[20:37:39] <headius> very little has changed in this stuff in the past month
[20:37:46] <headius> yeah try that
[20:38:02] <enebo[m]> but I have never pushed 9.3 as if I was releasing
[20:38:16] <enebo[m]> although I guess snapshots should mostly have similar requirements for things like sources
[20:38:34] <headius> right, if 20 works then something is off on master
[20:38:46] <headius> I don't see anything obvious in maven/ on 9.2 branch changes
[20:39:23] <headius> no changes whatsoever in that dir since January
[20:39:50] <headius> and the only change on master was switching to the public jakarta-annotation-api dep
[20:40:36] <headius> no leads
[20:41:37] <enebo[m]> yeah I noticed that
[20:53:25] <enebo[m]> https://gist.github.com/enebo/d687414b03cd470567ef3019cd66929b
[20:54:16] <enebo[m]> actually let me try that again just in case it was my env
[20:54:31] <enebo[m]> I had to kill a shell and I might not have been using right stuff
[21:02:26] <enebo[m]> ok 9.2 worked
[21:03:12] <enebo[m]> jruby-core makes a -sources too
[21:08:50] <headius> hmm ok
[22:17:37] <enebo[m]> [INFO] --- maven-source-plugin:2.1.2:jar-no-fork (attach-sources) @ jruby-core ---
[22:17:37] <enebo[m]> [INFO] No sources in project. Archive not created.
[22:18:01] <headius> hmm
[22:19:24] <enebo[m]> so share uses jar provided which is jruby-base so it doesn't really have source
[22:20:41] <enebo[m]> but when jruby-complete is marked as using jruby-core it expects it will have source jar?  Seems wrong to me
[22:21:52] <headius> I see the provided scope in complete config includes jruby-core excludes jruby-base
[22:22:14] <headius> not sure why it excludes base but perhaps removing that would have an impact
[22:22:57] <headius> might need to dig up mkristian otherwise, the new structure is peculiar
[22:23:00] <enebo[m]>       exclusion "org.jruby:jruby-base"
[22:23:17] <headius> right
[22:23:40] <enebo[m]> I can remove it and run it to see what happens I guess
[22:24:20] <enebo[m]> it seems pretty obvious that the things we use which were shaded should excluded
[22:24:39] <headius> yeah
[22:24:47] <enebo[m]> but the shade will change consumers too
[22:24:57] <enebo[m]> so we really don't want jruby-base here 
[22:25:13] <enebo[m]> but I am just guessing at what this line means.  I will try it
[22:26:00] <enebo[m]> It is a weird line in the context of jruby-core but I suppose this it to let Maven know it should not look at this artifact for resolution
[22:32:38] <enebo[m]> headius: here is a weird one.  I removed the exclusion and re-ran maven.  That exclusion is not even being put into pom.xml
[22:52:21] <enebo[m]> headius: sent an email to kristian with you cc'd
