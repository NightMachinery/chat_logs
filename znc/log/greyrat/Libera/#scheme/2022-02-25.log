[13:52:29] <paul_j> good morning guix!
[13:56:48] <paul_j> I am continuing to work with guix home, and have a quick question about shepherd services. I created a service for syncthing, but I think I used some code I found elsewhere. Anyway, I have now tried to create a service for gpg-connect, but I am getting an error "gpg-agent: unbound variable". I have the relevant code for the shepherd services here: https://paste.debian.net/1232206
[13:58:13] <paul_j> I am not sure where I am creating a variable, or at least where it differs from the syncthing definition. I don't think it is in the provision line, so I am guessing I am doing something wrong with the start and/or the stop fields.
[13:59:06] <paul_j> Sorry - wrong group...

[22:52:03] <Zipheir> What is "proper project-management software"?
[22:52:13] <Zipheir> dpk: ^
[22:53:03] <dpk> i hope i explained what i considered to be the features we need. a central repository of information about proposals, and a way to keep track of which issues remain open and which have been resolved
[22:53:34] <dpk> a bug tracker, in other words
[22:54:41] <Zipheir> Ah.  I can see some advantage to that.
[23:00:08] <Zipheir> I find it hard to believe that people object to `cut` because it's not related to Prolog !.
[23:04:24] <Zipheir> No to R7RS-large oligarchy, in any case.  It torpedoed R6RS, and I hope that isn't repeated.
[23:06:26] <Zipheir> And, indeed, I like the absence of official discussion forums.  The advantage of some R7RS-large issues/discussions repo would be as a citation location, IMHO.
[23:07:01] <Zipheir> It would definitely be nice to just link to some argument someone made, rather than digging through various mls.
[23:09:23] <Zipheir> dpk: Has anyone considered an open wikiesque draft page for various editions?
[23:09:59] <dpk> as Marc and I both said, oligarchy is not the aim, but efficiency
[23:10:43] <dpk> i like Linas's suggestion of using liquid democracy, but am also painfully aware of how liquid democracy has destroyed the various Pirate Parties which have tried it
[23:10:43] <gwatt> What's the expected volume of issues?
[23:11:02] <dpk> (or at least is claimed to have been a significant factor in their collapse)
[23:11:20] <dpk> gwatt: jcowan said somewhere between 4000â€“5000 for the whole of R7RS Large, conservatively
[23:11:40] <Zipheir> Again, what about trying a Wikipedia style model in which a draft edition is public and editable, and there's an informal consensus process?
[23:11:50] <dpk> if that's a true estimate of the number of such issues, we *need* somewhere to keep them all organized. too much is falling under the table at the moment
[23:12:04] <Zipheir> For all this talk of process, that's something I haven't seen anyone talk about.
[23:12:10] <dpk> Zipheir: a wiki based draft might work, although it's a novel approach
[23:12:17] <Zipheir> Oh dear, a novelty.
[23:12:21] <dpk> in this area, anyway
[23:12:33] <dpk> that wasn't intended as a criticism to sink your suggestion. we could try it!
[23:12:46] <dpk> especially if we don't have an editor, collaboratively editing might actually work
[23:14:30] <Zipheir> It's informal but sort of similar to what Arne talks about with proposing changes, voting, editing, voting, ...
[23:15:29] <Zipheir> Currently, the electorate is just stamping 'approved' on various ill-fitting SRFIs, and, as you say, there is a huge need for editing all this into some coherent whole.
[23:16:21] <dpk> perhaps we could try it with something like the gesichtete Versionen from dewp. (no idea what the MediaWiki extension/option is called in English, it's this bloody annoying feature on the German Wikipedia where every change that isn't made by someone who is absurdly, absurdly active on dewp has to be approved by someone who *is* that absurdly active before it can go live)
[23:17:57] <Zipheir> Sounds plausible.
[23:18:18] <Zipheir> Also, totally implementable with just some Git repos.
[23:19:34] <Zipheir> I'm also reminded of the Linux kernel workflow with those ... what are they called, czars? who filter a good version out of all their PRs.
[23:19:53] <gwatt> I think the polite term is "maintainers"
[23:19:56] *** Quits: jao (~jao@cpc103048-sgyl39-2-0-cust502.18-2.cable.virginm.net) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[23:20:10] <Zipheir> Hah.
[23:20:28] <Zipheir> But there is (was?) some in-house term for the various sub-maintainers, IIRC.
[23:20:37] <dpk> czar would be a particularly badly chosen term given current political situations
[23:20:40] <dpk> committers?
[23:21:36] <Zipheir> "Each kernel subsystem is assigned a maintainer who is responsible for reviewing patches against the kernel code standards ..."  I guess it's just 'maintainer' these days, then.
[23:22:22] <Zipheir> Of course, that creates the possibility for oligarchy, but it's just one approach.
[23:22:26] *** Joins: jao (~jao@87.249.134.38)
[23:23:11] <gwatt> In the case of linux, it's theoretically possible to appeal directly to Linus if you think the maintiners are being dumb
[23:26:22] <Zipheir> So, imagine, say, a maintainer group for a Public Vermillion Edition.  They and all their contributors are tasked with working the edition and all its component libraries into a coherent document.
[23:28:16] <Zipheir> Very bazaar-y, but random ballot results don't get set in stone.
[23:29:10] <Zipheir> Which is how the process seems to work at the moment.  Brief surges of democracy at the end of the process for a given edition.
[23:29:40] <Zipheir> Just thinking out lound, of course.
[23:29:46] <Zipheir> Loud, even.
