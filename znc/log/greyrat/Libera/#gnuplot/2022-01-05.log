[00:21:29] <luc4> mnhrdt: I tried with wxt, x11 and qt, but nothing changes. When there is a replot, the first cell disappears.
[00:43:39] <dfdx> luc4: I don't know about Rust but this is a common problem with gnuplot newcomers.
[00:43:46] <dfdx> (at the terminal, that is.)
[00:44:08] <dfdx> i.e., they will create a gnuplot script (e.g., chart.gp) and try to run it like this: $ gnuplot chart.gp
[00:44:17] <dfdx> and they see the plot flash before them and close.
[00:44:34] <dfdx> the trick is to use the --persist flag, like this: $ gnuplot -p chart.gp
[00:44:47] <dfdx> i'm not sure if that helps, but maybe. 
[01:44:02] <luc4> dfdx: yes, I already found this info, but I found out that the persist param is already passed here: https://github.com/SiegeLord/RustGnuplot/blob/master/gnuplot/src/figure.rs#L378
[01:44:43] <luc4> dfdx: also, would this explain why just cell 0 disappears?
[01:50:01] <dfdx> luc4: not sure. have you been able to get the behavior you want using raw gnuplot (i.e., outside of Rust)?
[01:51:41] <luc4> dfdx: unfortunately I've never used gnuplot this way, so I'm trying to understand how to do it. I have Octave scripts creating almost identical plots and those do not seem to show this issue, so I suppose this is a problem specific to the crate. I'm trying to ask here in the hope someone could give a hint.
[01:53:04] <luc4> dfdx: my understanding is that data is provided to gnuplot via stdin. So I guess I should edit the crate code and dump whatever is sent in the stream and use it from command line.
[02:15:50] <dfdx> I hope someone in the channel knows enough Rust to help you. I unfortunately don't know enough Rust to help you out, sorry. But "pure" gnuplot (i.e., from the terminal) shouldn't behave this way. And your Octave scripts seem to also point to the fact that this is perhaps a problem in your Rust code somewhere else.
[02:24:19] <luc4> dfdx: yes, in fact I'm looking for an issue in that Rust code. However, that Rust code seems to simply be starting gnuplot as an external process passing in data via stdin. So, if someone has any idea of a situation in which something like this may happen, regardless of Rust, please let me know.

[03:12:02] <luc4> dfdx: do you happen to know what terminal octave is using by default? It seems the windows that appears is different from the one I'm using.
[03:14:57] <luc4> dfdx: ah ah... found out that octave is not using gnuplot
[03:15:13] <luc4> dfdx: if I force the use of gnuplot, the same happens
