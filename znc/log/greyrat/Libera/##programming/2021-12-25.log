[01:35:04] <pyzozord> On the other side there might be languages who also formalize that space as diligently as rust, but just make the space much smaller. That means there is less things you can do. The things you can't you of course need to invent construct by yourself

[01:36:52] <pyzozord> Tangential to that axis there are languages that formalize the space less diligently like C. C's space of possibilities is medium size but it has not very many rules to guard that space, and that is what makes it more powerful
[01:36:52] <[itchyjunk]> if your language is turing complete, you can write an equivalent thing from any other turing complete language

[01:41:31] <pyzozord> Rust is powerful and formalized that results in a complex language. C is medium power and medium formalizm. I am thinking about language that is also formalized but small power. That makes the language simple because it doesn't need many rules to cover all formalization. That means you can do simple stuff easily. But that also means that you will do more work with complex stuff

[02:20:05] <dan01[m]> + some padding

[14:51:53] <mishugana> GeDaMo: Thank you. Yes, my question is not specific to asm itself but rather learning it today. Let me ask the question anyway. Back in my uni days, I learnt 8085 and then 8086 asm (using masm on DOS IIRC). I loved it. Recently I thought of picking it up again for fun, and then realised that x86 on Linux seems to be practically the only one getting some love from resources. I managed to find some 
[14:52:02] <mishugana> from Linux x64. So one question is - how significant a difference between macOS, Linux and Windows in this regard. Say, using nasm on all three. I presume that Windows would have the biggest difference from the other two? Calling conventions, addressing modes, anything else I should look into?
[14:52:25] <nomagno> Theoretically speaking, if you can perform a xor without temp storage, you can swap without temp storage
[14:52:38] <GeDaMo> Linux and MacOS calling conventions are similar but syscall numbers are different

[15:20:00] <GeDaMo> Possibly?

[18:34:01] <pulse> If all you do is jump out of the loop, deducing control flow is trivial
[18:34:05] <mrig> Donitz deeply nested is already a bad sign.
[18:34:11] <pulse> You can do evil shit with goto but most people avoid that on principle
[18:34:17] <mrig> which silly billy did that?
[18:34:19] <pulse> mrig, I don't think so
[18:34:35] <pulse> Some problems just require deep nested iteration
[18:34:39] <mrig> depends on the situation of course, best avoided when you can though.
[18:34:49] <pulse> Yeah, I mean, don't nest when you don't need to obviously :P
[18:35:11] <mrig> I mean if you dont want to use goto, same goes for goto, sometimes it is the best solution.

[18:55:55] <ProfSimm> OK what about representing values as opaque functions with no type, where you can only ask "can you give me int" and it gives you an int or not.
[18:56:05] <ProfSimm> It can give you multiple types when asked, or none.

[19:00:02] <Decker> unions = superposition?

[19:00:21] <mrig> one
[19:00:56] <mrig> ProfSimm I dont think that it is either, it is at least heavily weighted.
[19:00:57] <ProfSimm> I'm thinking maybe we make values overloadable on expected output by passing the expected output type as input

Sorry for ruining your emotions about scientific inventions, but these types of meshes or combinations of chemical elements are always speculative scientific divages that have no realistic or practical purpose other than to entertain science fans.

[23:10:44] <mrig> but when you get to dodecohedrons and pentagons, there you get some cool properties of the 6 fold symmetry.
[23:10:46] <GeDaMo> C60 Fullerene is composed of hexagons and pentagons
[23:10:55] <mrig> ^
[23:12:11] <pulse> Pentagons are too occult
[23:12:28] <mrig> I really do need to study some of the basics of crystalline structures.
[23:12:42] <mrig> love this application of geometry.
[23:12:55] <mrig> To understand the 120-cell better, note the dodecahedron has 5 * 12 = 60 rotational symmetries, since a rotation can carry a face to any of the 12 faces, each in 5 different ways.

[23:35:20] <fweht> can someone explain the difference between shadertoy and webgl?  it seems that shadertoy supports some syntax, like ternary operator, that is not supported in webgl.  so does it have some precompiler to generate webgl code?  is that available as standalone maybe?
