[00:10:35] <agregate> I can't find much use case of OpenMP + pthreads online, and there is one stackoverflow question from 10 years ago (see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7433685/mixing-openmp-with-pthreads) where some people believe it's fine to mix them together, but I'm more worried whether or not its undefined behaviour to mix them
[00:10:42] <Dagmar> Like, you set it up with soft fail and then you check to make sure everythings working and no one's rejecting your mail and none of your "business partners" are sending mail that appears to be from your domain from some sketchy little servers they own and run (ahem) and then you enable hard fail

[01:45:30] <adderall> Appeal to authority fallacy
[01:45:30] <Dagmar> The core and defining thing a package manager does is to keep track of which files belong to which package so they can be cleanly removed and/or upgraded.
[01:45:36] <adderall> I do that too

[01:49:19] <Sauvin> yetimach, I think part of the answer to that question may depend on what you're using system() for.
[01:49:36] <rbox> yetimach: the worst thing you could possibly do
[01:50:07] <yetimach> I feel like if you are using system(), you should just write the thing in bash script.
[01:50:17] <Dagmar> You could always use execve().  ;)

[01:51:03] <yetimach> I suppose I am thinking on a small scale.
[01:51:11] <Dagmar> I mean, you're usually calling something that's a shell command at that point
[01:51:22] <rbox> i've yet to find the scale where it is appropriate

[01:51:38] <adderall> Dagmar, are you trying to trick me into running something like a forkbomb?
[01:51:39] <Dagmar> It just fails to take into account that the things one is doing prior to then might be fantastically complex and/or excruciatingly painful to do in bash

[01:51:59] <akik> i've never fsckd /dev

[01:52:05] <yetimach> no, there are crossed wires here.

[01:56:11] <rascul> if you truly have a static /dev then either you set it up yourself or you're on a truly ancient distro
[01:56:14] <Dagmar> ...but no, if /dev is devtmpfs and can't be corrupted you need to stop and look _real close_ at what the system is telling you the next time it needs an fsck
[01:56:38] <Dagmar> Slackware was pretty much the last distro to still be using a static /dev, and they ended that SOME years back

[10:09:08] <scara> like instead of -s ip1,ip2,ip3 etc, could I use a file?
[10:09:09] <ayecee> maybe use the ipset module

[10:09:40] <scara> I would also like to note that I have never modified iptables before today so what I'm saying could be stupid.
[10:09:42] <ayecee> yup, that's the one. it's described in the iptables-extensions manpage
[10:09:46] <auk> koo5_, ayecee so apparently dm-unstriped exists: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v5.16-rc6/admin-guide/device-mapper/unstriped.html
[10:09:58] <ayecee> auk: this does what?
[10:10:56] <auk> I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around how it works exactly, but apparently it can 'unstripe' a striped setup... for example give you access to the underlying disks in a raid array
[10:11:52] <scara> ayecee: "No manual entry for ipset in section 8" is it something I have to install?
[10:12:12] <ayecee> scara: the ipset utility is separate, so maybe yes
[10:12:26] <scara> Also I have to apply this everytime I reboot right? Iptables isn't presistent.
[10:12:29] <auk> "...setup 4 loop devices and use the existing striped target to combine the 4 devices into one. [...] unstriped target ontop of the striped device to access the individual backing loop devices."
[10:12:29] <ayecee> the ipset builds the set of ips that are passed in one go to the module

[10:14:10] <ayecee> there is a netfilter-persist thingy in some distributions that will save your settings on shutdown and restore on boot.
[10:14:15] <sheep> iptables has iptables-save and iptables-restore, but you need to set up services to save iptables-save's result when shutting down and run iptables-restore on that output when starting
[10:14:19] <ayecee> yeah, that thing.

[10:16:39] <ayecee> to be honest i haven't seen iptables rules with multiple source addresses like that before. does it work with smaller lists?
[10:18:09] <auk> what i don't understand about dm-unstriped is... if you layer it on top of dm-stripe, then is dm-stripe still doing its thing too, or is it like the dm-stripe never existed
[10:18:32] <ayecee> seems like it
[10:18:46] <auk> the example they give about using unstriped on a disk that has two separate cores with RAID0 built in, that i get
[10:19:29] <auk> ayecee, seems like it (1) still doing its thing or (2) dm-stripe never existed?
[10:20:04] <auk> i mean i know you're not familiar with it
[10:20:56] <auk> also in the meantime, i think using tahoe-lafs with all nodes located in local directories can bring read-write parity to a single disk

[10:23:24] <ayecee> the case you had in mind.
[10:23:33] <ayecee> so, not read-only. got it.

[10:24:25] <auk> yep also true. Altho that could be implemented relatively easy in a DIY fuse script i think

[12:23:36] <ayecee> weird to look for "best". i mean, if there was a best, why would anyone use anything else?
[12:24:04] <__ad> ok ok, a good onw

[15:59:57] <iratedownloader> Hello People, I have a bash server that I have to frequently connect to(like 10 times a day). To do that, the process is: 1) SSH with username & host 2) Enter pass 3) Enter TOTP code 4) ssh into another server, as the previous is a bastion. 5) enter password. Is there a way I can automate this to 1 step? I can get TOTP code via OAuthGen but not sure how I can do the rest.
[16:00:12] <rascul> it doesn't mangle configs either so you can use or not use yast as you desire

[18:48:21] <domicron> rascul, one of the goals? The entire purpose of the product. Literally, redshift was made to create a mass exodus from oracle. And it never happened.

[18:48:21] <domicron> that from subaru. And when the engine totally falls apart, I'm ok with subaru sourcing a new one from nissan. You've got to be completely retarded if you think that redshift is anything but a failure. It does not meet the same performance, and it does that for a higher cost.

[19:55:38] <esselfe> hey! took a while but it started!
[19:55:47] <rascul> i was recently using one that i could have a whisper level conversation with someone while standing right next to the generator
[19:55:57] <Thuryn> main power drops, UPS is right there.  batteries don't "start up" so you still have power.  but the main power dropping also needs to trigger the generator to start up.
[19:56:07] <rascul> esselfe it did start finally? perhaps you have something in a startup file holding it up
[19:56:17] <Thuryn> once the generator is online, it can take over the load and the UPS goes back to standby.
[19:56:19] <perrierjouet> the generator is the way to go ? like this https://www.homedepot.ca/product/generac-guardian-24kw-automatic-home-standby-generator-wi-fi-enabled/1001581035

[19:59:07] <rascul> some geenrators you have to worry about wet stacking when using too little power
[19:59:29] <rascul> i think that's the diesel ones
[19:59:30] <ayecee> perrierjouet: if they're burning that much power, make sure your generator can power the cooling too.
[19:59:48] <ayecee> that's like two hair dryers worth of heat
[20:00:15] <hexnewbie> perrierjouet: And yeah, if the power supply says 1500 W, that doesn't main that the server will be draining 1500 W throughout the whole hour

[20:00:42] <HiccupJul> if i want to ssh into a windows (8) machine, is it better to use the openssh package by microsoft, or should i just install cygwin or something?

[20:01:28] <HiccupJul> i guess i'll follow the wiki instructions for that, but they didn't look that thorough
[20:01:36] <rascul> just because it says 1500 doesn't necessarily mean it'll ever draw 1500

[20:02:20] <MrElendig> also, your ups/generator have to be able to handle the inrush current on poweron
[20:02:26] <hexnewbie> Which means it wouldn't even hit 750 W; check consumption rates for your CPU

Then  I again use ssh to connect to a server from there. I put this in a file & when I run it, it says "pseudo terminal will not be allocated because stdin is not a terminal". I googled & found a -t -t parameter for the second command & while it connects, the

[20:16:55] <pinky_> haven't found that in the linux gpio docs yet though, something about how thats what base is for, but i can't seem to set base

[23:04:00] <mattf> im building curl and brotli from source, how can i tell ./configure to use the libbrtli so from another folder
[23:04:06] <personx__> okay so I'm trying to decide between hetzner [2GB RAM @ 5.55usd/m] and contabo [8GB RAM @ 8.25usd/m], I was told 4GB RAM was enough for complete irdemail setup but if I disable the anti-virus, it can run easily on 2GB RAM as well. what should I go with?
