[17:55:36] <Akulen> Hello, I just updated my plugins, and the vertical bar to highlight indentation levels seems to have changed. Previously it was dashed and discrete, but now it is solid and extremely noticable. Is it possible to revert it or to make it less visible?
[18:55:59] <Akulen> Don't worry anymore, I've finally decided not to use spacevim anymore and switch back to neovim
