[06:30:08] <Millicent> your familiarity with shells will at least :P

[06:30:31] <Hydragyrum> same
[06:30:32] <yippeekaiyay> OK ... so, I changed my nick. Will it stay like this until I reset it - even after disconnecting from the shell?
[06:30:41] <yippeekaiyay> ... like if I exit out of WSL and return to the CMD
[06:30:53] <Millicent> so you configure your client with the nickname you want, and save that config
[06:31:01] <Millicent> then we it reconnects it tries for that nickname

[06:32:17] <yippeekaiyay> On SASL?
[06:32:31] <Millicent> Unfortunate thing about education is there's always lots missed, but real world experience is where you do most of your learning anyway
[06:32:34] <Millicent> yeah

[06:33:42] <Millicent> Sure, but I would have though SASL would be sufficiently popular to warrant a mention at least :P
[06:33:46] <yippeekaiyay> So, for instance, we would study SSL and TLS or UDP vs TCP etc ... And we need to know when or why protocols are used but if it's something more general and less relevant, we didn't cover it. But that's more to do with my program

[06:34:07] <Millicent> was it just a security module added on to a networking degree or something?
[06:34:08] <yippeekaiyay> They didn't even teach us how to script. I learned bash myself and am studying PowerShell now
[06:34:09] <Millicent> that would explain it more
[06:34:33] <yippeekaiyay> No ... it was purely cybersecurity but the peopel in the program didn't all have science backgrounds
[06:34:44] <yippeekaiyay> So, for instance, if you're doing a MITM attack, you should know how to do it manually
[06:34:50] <yippeekaiyay> By writing your own scripts
[06:34:55] <yippeekaiyay> But we would use something like Ettercap

[07:12:21] <Affliction> of course
[07:12:24] <Millicent> here no, but irc in general absolutely

[07:28:42] <writeback[m]> "For Microsoft Office, Application Guard helps prevents untrusted Word, PowerPoint and Excel files from accessing trusted resources. Application Guard opens untrusted files in an isolated Hyper-V-enabled container. The isolated Hyper-V container is separate from the host operating system. This container isolation means that if the untrusted site or file turns out to be malicious, the host device is protected, and the attacker can't get
[07:28:42] <writeback[m]> to your enterprise data. For example, this approach makes the isolated container anonymous, so an attacker can't get to your employee's enterprise credentials."

[07:32:10] <yippeekaiyay> Now you're making me think I should be a smartass in my next interview and ask the interviewer to define a type 1 vs type 2 hypervisor ... "Can you give me some examples?"
[07:32:14] <ic3blx_> laptops expensive aaah
[07:32:24] <labrador> Its goal was freedom,and running as a vm on spyware is not freedom
[07:32:29] <yippeekaiyay> ... "Why would you prefer one or the other? Gotta make sure you know yer stuff, man. The interview goes both ways."
[07:33:28] <ic3blx_> do you code?
[07:33:34] <yippeekaiyay> I once had a coworker who thought he could hide himself in a VM during attacks. Got his Sec+ ... he knew it all. Then I had to explain to him in a roundabout way that VM escape is a thing and can go both ways
[07:33:40] <Affliction> shit I never remember the type numbers, I just know one is bare metal and the other is hosted.
[07:33:40] <yippeekaiyay> I try to code
[07:33:45] <yippeekaiyay> Does trying count as doing?
[07:33:47] <yippeekaiyay> LOL
[07:34:00] <ic3blx_> lmao
[07:34:03] <ic3blx_> what do u mean try
[07:34:06] <ic3blx_> adhd getting to u
[07:34:09] <yippeekaiyay> If you were a hiring manager, I would say, "Umm, I have some scripting experience, but I'm not a dev." I think I will stop saying that though
[07:34:16] *** Joins: LtHummus (~lthummus@97-126-121-3.tukw.qwest.net)
[07:34:27] <yippeekaiyay> Wait, are you saying that in light of my original handle on here?
[07:34:32] <yippeekaiyay> *the ADHD comment?
[07:34:42] <yippeekaiyay> Or is that a coincidence?
[07:34:51] <writeback[m]> are you referring to virtual8086/"unreal mode"?
[07:34:54] <writeback[m]> * (one for the *real* kernel space, * kernel space that runs all the guest os stuff and basically everything, and, * for userspace/non-root partition )
[07:34:55] <writeback[m]> e.g memory corruption in the kernel is alot harder when kernel address space is isolated
[07:34:55] <writeback[m]> i mean total seperate address range controlled by EPT switching (one for kernel space, and one for userspace)
[07:34:55] <writeback[m]> im not a fan of secure kernel, all the hyperv/vbs stuff, but at the end of the day, performance hit is neglible for most people (exceptions being something like a system with lots of cores); and it frankly just solves alot of issues
[07:34:55] <writeback[m]> Affliction: but yea, it is a bit funny. but with all the virtualization tech we have nowadays there is really no reason to not be leveraging hypervisors for security
[07:34:55] <writeback[m]> and i dont mean isolation as in KPTI/KVA shadowing
[07:34:55] <writeback[m]> oh, 60s? that's before the 8086 so must not be ahaha
[07:34:58] <writeback[m]> oh wtf
[07:35:04] <writeback[m]> my internet just cut out and m ymessages got spread out
[07:35:05] <yippeekaiyay> One, ADHD always gets to me and according to the Netflix doc on it, it gets to everyone - adults more than kids now.
[07:35:06] <writeback[m]> sorry for that
[07:35:26] <writeback[m]> Affliction: type2 is hosted, type1 is bare metal
[07:35:34] <Affliction> right
[07:35:36] <yippeekaiyay> Hypervisors shouldn't be used as sandboxes in my opinion
[07:35:41] <writeback[m]> writing a type2 is doable in a week or two if youre well versed in C and x86 arch
[07:35:46] <yippeekaiyay> If you're gonna do that, have a machine devoted to it that's airgapped
[07:35:47] <Affliction> I'll forget that within the hour :)
[07:35:53] <yippeekaiyay> A hypervisor is a poor man's airgapped box
[07:35:54] <writeback[m]> a type1 requires alot more bullshit
[07:36:00] <writeback[m]> you have to write a bootloader or atleast make it load your hypervisor
[07:36:00] <yippeekaiyay> But I'm a poor man, relatively speaking, so ...
[07:36:11] <ic3blx_> that
[07:36:16] <ic3blx_> and the trying to code comment :D
[07:36:18] <yippeekaiyay> And I don't know how to write a bootloader
[07:36:25] <yippeekaiyay> Back to the coding question, I am learning Google Go
[07:36:31] <writeback[m]> yippeekaiyay: you should try
[07:36:39] <writeback[m]> legacy bios bootloaders are hell to write but its not "hard" per say
[07:36:43] <writeback[m]> its just really really time consuming
[07:36:44] <yippeekaiyay> My background is in liberal arts. I didn't start fucking with computers seriously until I was much older
[07:37:00] <writeback[m]> uefi bootloaders? no clue but with EDK2 existing, cant be worse then legacy bios
[07:37:05] <writeback[m]> * no clue. but
[07:37:11] <yippeekaiyay> If I had gone about this the traditional way, I'd have my CompSci degree. But when I was getting my B.A., there weren't cybersecurity or infosec degrees.
[07:37:17] <writeback[m]> * no clue,, *  only know a bit about uefi. but with
[07:37:18] <yippeekaiyay> Or, if there were, I was unaware of them
[07:37:25] <writeback[m]> fuck compsci
[07:37:31] <labrador> Why?
[07:37:33] <writeback[m]> i feel like you can teach yourself that shit on your own
[07:37:34] <yippeekaiyay> Poeple who were into security, got CompSci degrees and security jobs through their passions
[07:37:53] <writeback[m]> i know the same can be said for a lot of things, teaching yourself
[07:38:12] <yippeekaiyay> Can teach yourself, yes. Self-taught are always more knowledgeable than textbook folks ...
[07:38:16] <writeback[m]> but with CS especially because you can learn cs if you have a computer an editor and internet access
[07:38:19] <Affliction> EFI loaders would probably be easier, no having to load a 2nd stage within 510 bytes, you have the EFI API to work with
[07:38:29] <yippeekaiyay> It's not about what you know though. It's about whether or not you can think.
[07:38:39] <writeback[m]> Affliction: yea, ive been meaning to write a type1
[07:38:50] <writeback[m]> but i'd have to get up to speed with uefi beyond the basics
[07:38:50] <yippeekaiyay> So, knowing how a TLS encryption process works won't indicate a person's ability to spot an exploit on a live system or prevent a breach.
[07:38:54] <yippeekaiyay> They might get the job, yes
[07:39:10] <yippeekaiyay> But if they don't have the mind to recognize anomolies, the textbook shit is all useless
[07:39:18] <writeback[m]> yippeekaiyay: ?
[07:39:18] <writeback[m]> i dont understand this
[07:39:18] <writeback[m]> "it's not about what you know"
[07:39:23] <yippeekaiyay> We need peole who think differently - not people who just memorize shit
[07:39:41] <yippeekaiyay> It's not about memorizing definitions is what I mean
[07:39:43] <writeback[m]> people who know shit haven't just memorized it man
[07:39:55] <yippeekaiyay> OK, so it's to some extent about what you know if we're having a philosophical argument or discussion
[07:39:56] <writeback[m]> they have implemented things, debugged, gone through trial and error
[07:40:00] <writeback[m]> talked to people about said toopic
[07:40:10] <yippeekaiyay> Because how do you separate what you know from what you think or how you think and when or how do you draw the line?
[07:40:16] <writeback[m]> thats people who know shit, people who are posers just know wikipedia articles to recite verbatim
[07:40:17] <ic3blx_> artist indeed
[07:40:19] <ic3blx_> hah
[07:40:29] <writeback[m]> idk thats too much mind games for me
[07:40:32] <yippeekaiyay> But those people who regurgitate shit are the people getting jobs
[07:40:36] <ic3blx_> creativity is also plenty important
[07:40:38] <ic3blx_> as with anything
[07:40:41] <yippeekaiyay> The smartest guys don't get paid the most, man
[07:40:42] <ic3blx_> grasp the basics and freestyle it
[07:40:52] <ic3blx_> IS HE the smartest guy then??
[07:40:54] <writeback[m]> they get paid more and can climb the salary ladder
[07:41:03] <yippeekaiyay> The guys who make the most are the most confident and the best at convinving people they're right even in cases where the person is dead wrong.
[07:41:09] <yippeekaiyay> Going beyond faking it to make it
[07:41:18] <yippeekaiyay> Getting into some Jetti mindtrick bullshit
[07:41:23] <writeback[m]> ... i dont follow
[07:41:38] <writeback[m]> business is not the same sort of field i thought we were discussin g
[07:41:42] <yippeekaiyay> Convincing your colleague that he's wrong and you're right then convincing eveyrone else he's wrong ... when he's in fact been right the whole time
[07:41:47] <yippeekaiyay> It's a dog-eat-dog world
[07:41:53] <writeback[m]> ?????????????????????
[07:42:03] <Millicent> Okay now I'm lost too
[07:42:04] <writeback[m]> thats called being a shitty person
[07:42:14] <writeback[m]> those people dont get as far as you think they do man
[07:42:16] <yippeekaiyay> Oh, sorry ... no, I'm not advocating for any of this!
[07:42:20] <yippeekaiyay> I'm not making value claims
[07:42:21] <writeback[m]> i know youire not
[07:42:23] <Millicent> I was kinda following - I mean, it's what you know, but that's irrelevant if you can't think for yourself/apply it, and figure out new things
[07:42:40] <Millicent> but knowledge + application are different to succeeding in business; different skillsets
[07:42:48] <writeback[m]> Millicent: yep
[07:42:56] <Millicent> they don't have to be mutually exclusive but they don't naturally go hand in hand
[07:42:57] <yippeekaiyay> And, before I even say anything further, I have a cybersecurity degree from a business college. So, the idea is that myself and my classmates, we could be CISOs one day if we play our cards right.
[07:43:02] <yippeekaiyay> But a CISO isn't always technical
[07:43:21] <writeback[m]> what are you trying to say
[07:43:25] <yippeekaiyay> The CISO of Advance Auto Parts where I worked got hired in her position with having absolutely no security experience.
[07:43:30] <yippeekaiyay> So, yes, there's quite a difference there
[07:43:40] <yippeekaiyay> Sorry - I htink I'm just rambling
[07:43:40] <writeback[m]> i could be making airplanes in 10 years and you could be a ciso
[07:43:42] <yippeekaiyay> I'll shut up
[07:43:44] <writeback[m]> yeah
[07:43:46] <writeback[m]> nono its fine
[07:43:52] <writeback[m]> i just am a tad confused
[07:44:04] <yippeekaiyay> I'll need to be more confident if I want to be a CISO
[07:44:34] <yippeekaiyay> I'll have to be more like a Steve Jobs and less like a Socrates or Buddha if I go that route.
[07:44:43] <ic3blx_> or just portray yourself as confident : D
[07:44:47] <yippeekaiyay> Yes!
[07:44:47] <writeback[m]> ^
[07:44:49] <yippeekaiyay> Youve got it
[07:44:50] <writeback[m]> that works almost as wel
[07:44:52] <Millicent> you can think like Socrates or Buddha if you talk like Steve Jobs
[07:44:58] <Millicent> it's how people perceive you that matters, in that world
[07:45:01] <yippeekaiyay> You're hired! LOL
[07:45:08] <ic3blx_> intelligence is adaptation, I believe
[07:45:12] <yippeekaiyay> Ha, I'm in no position to hire someone, but ...
[07:45:15] <yippeekaiyay> If only ...
[07:45:15] <writeback[m]> steve jobs was a verbal genius
[07:45:21] <ic3blx_> the one who adapts best to what life serves him, achieves the most
[07:45:26] <yippeekaiyay> Steve Jobs knew how to soder motherboards, LOL
[07:45:35] <writeback[m]> id hope so
[07:45:37] <yippeekaiyay> So he worked for Atari. I dont know... Shouldn't speak ill of the dead
[07:45:40] <labrador> Steve jobs didnt really do anything
[07:45:42] <yippeekaiyay> I can't do whatever it is he did
[07:45:46] <yippeekaiyay> So, fuck it, I'll give him credit
[07:45:47] <labrador> Wozniak tho on the other hand...
[07:45:48] <writeback[m]> it was mostly woz
[07:45:50] <labrador> Yeah
[07:45:53] <yippeekaiyay> But he wasn't that technical
[07:45:55] <writeback[m]> woz did the actual engineering
[07:46:05] <ic3blx_> yeah but imagine woz presenting it to the world
[07:46:06] <writeback[m]> steve did the design and marketing which, to be fair, is its own skillset
[07:46:07] <labrador> Jobs was just a good marketer
[07:46:10] <yippeekaiyay> The Woz is the Zen master
[07:46:13] <writeback[m]> LOL
[07:46:18] <ic3blx_> :D
[07:46:27] <yippeekaiyay> But the Woz is a fat dorky guy who didn't care about fame. I'm a fat dorky guy so I can say that
[07:46:29] <writeback[m]> being a good marketer is a lot easier said then done
[07:46:30] <yippeekaiyay> No judgements there
[07:47:13] <yippeekaiyay> Circling around full conversation, I suppose I won't be on here too much since I'm usually running my VPN 24/7
[07:47:33] <writeback[m]> if you dont want to disconnect then just setup a bouncer
[07:47:44] <writeback[m]> lets you read backlog too
[07:47:48] <ajak> you can also just reconnect at will
[07:47:55] <writeback[m]> that too
[07:47:56] <yippeekaiyay> OK, tell me how to set up a bouncer in a way that I shouldn't feel like a dumbass

[07:49:28] <yippeekaiyay> Alright, so with this bouncer business, is the bouncer a fully-functioning client. Meaning? It's not just a security module in the background?
[07:49:38] <Millicent> Bouncer is the client
[07:49:41] <yippeekaiyay> It can replace the non-bouncer feature of what I'm on now
[07:49:44] <Millicent> then your irc client treats bouncer as irc server
[07:49:52] <yippeekaiyay> Yeah, that's complicated
[07:49:58] <Millicent> how so?
[07:50:03] <Millicent> literally two lines :P
[07:50:04] <writeback[m]> tldr; bouncer is a permanently online irc client
[07:50:17] <writeback[m]> if that makes it understandable to you
[07:50:19] <writeback[m]> not true but for your concerns it is
[07:50:20] <Millicent> Client ---> Bouncer ----> Server
[07:50:21] <yippeekaiyay> That's like setting up Kali on WSL and having an X-server to run it properly. It's not hard but it's a lot of work.
[07:50:24] <writeback[m]> * not tecvhnically true but
[07:50:28] <Hydragyrum> irc bouncer is a client stapled to a server, you host a bouncer and connect to it like it's the server
[07:50:32] <Millicent> It's a *lot* less work than that
[07:50:39] <yippeekaiyay> And, going back to this business of anyone can do anything but no one would bother... I'm not sure it's worth the trouble
[07:50:44] <writeback[m]> win11 has native x apps
[07:50:46] <writeback[m]> for wsl2
[07:50:49] <writeback[m]> fyi
[07:50:54] <writeback[m]> no need to set up your own vcxsrv
[07:50:58] <yippeekaiyay> I'm on Win10
[07:50:58] <Millicent> That's a different conversation, whether it's worth the trouble - but the trouble is small
[07:51:03] <Millicent> comparative to your examples
[07:51:06] <yippeekaiyay> Wait, there are already people using Win11?
[07:51:14] <Millicent> yep; plenty
[07:51:14] <yippeekaiyay> I know businesses won't swtich to 11 for another few years
[07:51:15] <ajak> it exists so yes
[07:51:16] <writeback[m]> yes but anyway
[07:51:19] <writeback[m]> it is not much trouble to set up a bouner at all
[07:51:20] <Millicent> plenty of businesses are on it
[07:51:25] <Millicent> we have maybe 15 clients using it already
[07:51:25] <yippeekaiyay> It exists full of security holes, LOL
[07:51:28] <Hydragyrum> using a bouncer is nearly as easy as just connecting raw and unprotected tbh
[07:51:29] <yippeekaiyay> It is our job security
[07:51:31] <ajak> you could also use something like quassel too
[07:51:32] <writeback[m]> use xshellz if you really dont want to put in the 30-60 minutes to set it up

[07:52:29] <yippeekaiyay> Alright, now ... how often do folks trace the IPs of cloaked users?
[07:52:35] <writeback[m]> we're not even talking about clients, forget about quassel, it would be easier to setup a bouncer then to figure out a new client
[07:52:44] <yippeekaiyay> Is this a "thing"? People are doing this all the time ... stalking mofos on here?

[07:57:28] <sdfgsdfg> https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1918
[07:57:28] <websec> ^ RFC 1918 - Address Allocation for Private Internets
[07:57:34] <writeback[m]> that was quick
[07:57:44] <sdfgsdfg> because someone here forwarded me to it very recently lol
[07:57:57] <yippeekaiyay> Yes, but if you take something like the Network+, you wouldn't necessarily think to look back to the RFCs
[07:58:10] <sdfgsdfg> I wouldn't look to RFCs at all
[07:58:15] <writeback[m]> do those certs even teach you anything
[07:58:19] <yippeekaiyay> And I'm hinting at this during this discussion. What they're teachin' the yougin's this day isn't to be resourceful and RTFM
[07:58:20] <writeback[m]> ^
[07:58:32] <writeback[m]> they do teach that in school
[07:58:33] <yippeekaiyay> Teaching people shit in a textbook and they never think to look up for the original manual
[07:58:41] <writeback[m]> read book and do practice
[07:58:46] <writeback[m]> the manual is the text book
[07:58:48] <yippeekaiyay> Didn't teach me anything about the original manuals. Everything was skimmed over
[07:58:55] <writeback[m]> ok
[07:58:56] <writeback[m]> example: math
[07:58:57] <yippeekaiyay> OK, here's how to subnet VLANs ... next
[07:59:01] <writeback[m]> calculus book for college students
[07:59:07] <sdfgsdfg> how much of it do you remember
[07:59:10] <yippeekaiyay> Here's how to do a phish test with SET on Kali ... next
[07:59:17] <writeback[m]> hundreds of years ago?
[07:59:18] <writeback[m]> youi want them to read the theses and foundation of calculus papers written
[07:59:19] <sdfgsdfg> phish is done in india
[07:59:21] <writeback[m]> i just dont get that view of "textbook bad"
[07:59:22] <Millicent> sounds like you need a better institution haha
[07:59:34] <writeback[m]> sdfgsdfg: no, it's done in the sea
[08:00:04] <yippeekaiyay> No, my school is good for what it did. They taught people with all backgrounds so the calculus shit wouldn't have worked
[08:00:09] <yippeekaiyay> That's like something they do at WGU
[08:00:17] <yippeekaiyay> ... (I dont' know who in here is in the states)
[08:00:20] <writeback[m]> "wouldn't have worked"
[08:00:24] <writeback[m]> i am
[08:00:33] <sdfgsdfg> it's usually the customer support crowd that breaks bad and starts phishing their customers - which is mostly indians
[08:00:36] <writeback[m]> idk what wgu is
[08:00:40] <sdfgsdfg> eventually they break
[08:00:46] <writeback[m]> some commnity collegeZ?
[08:00:46] <yippeekaiyay> Western Governors University
[08:00:51] <yippeekaiyay> You can look at their academic philosophy
[08:01:04] <writeback[m]> online school is stupid to me
[08:01:04] <yippeekaiyay> My school focused on getting people jobs and giving them the bare essentials to make money
[08:01:14] <writeback[m]> sounds like trade school
[08:01:18] <writeback[m]> but im not judging
[08:01:20] <writeback[m]> if it worked for you, hell yea
[08:01:21] <yippeekaiyay> Well-rounded cyber people who can do a little of everything. But jack of all - master of none.
[08:01:30] <yippeekaiyay> You're talking about "Bruce Lee" cyber types
[08:01:41] <yippeekaiyay> Yes, those people can do very high math and know several languages
[08:01:42] <writeback[m]> i dont know what that means
[08:01:49] <labrador> If you don't understand calculus,how do you even comprehend comsci?
[08:01:53] <writeback[m]> ^
[08:01:54] <labrador> compsci*
[08:02:04] <Millicent> you have stackoverflow bookmarked ;)
[08:02:06] <yippeekaiyay> You can learn cybersecurity without CompSci
[08:02:08] <Millicent> haha

[08:02:15] <labrador> yippeekaiyay, not really
[08:02:16] <yippeekaiyay> CompSci doesn't cover much of cyber law
[08:02:25] <labrador> you need to understand what you're doing first
[08:02:29] <labrador> That requires maths
[08:02:30] *** Joins: idanoo (~idanoomtr@2001:470:69fc:105::b575)
[08:02:33] <yippeekaiyay> Bu what does that mean?
[08:02:38] <writeback[m]> academic cs (e.g type theory, compiler development, etc) is all super logic heavy
[08:02:44] <yippeekaiyay> You know what you're doing for whom?
[08:02:49] <Affliction> I guess it depends on what area you're looking for
[08:02:49] <writeback[m]> wat
[08:02:55] <sdfgsdfg> whom are you doing what
[08:02:57] <sdfgsdfg> for
[08:03:01] <Affliction> You won't get far without it if you want to figure out how buffer overflows work
[08:03:12] <yippeekaiyay> A former classmate who "doesn't know what he's doing" just left a teaching job in a cybersecurity department at a 100K-plus salary.
[08:03:26] <sdfgsdfg> did he write a book
[08:03:28] <writeback[m]> probably wont get past that 100k salary
[08:03:31] <sdfgsdfg> on cybersecurity
[08:03:32] <labrador> yippeekaiyay, will never understand very well what he's doing tho
[08:03:34] <yippeekaiyay> So, if he doesn't know his shit but he's getting paid that much to teach people shit he doesn't know ... I'm gonna say it's serving him just fine
[08:03:42] <labrador> Cant write a book without understanding
[08:03:45] <yippeekaiyay> OK, so he can do his CTFs
[08:03:48] <yippeekaiyay> He can do those
[08:03:48] <sdfgsdfg> you dont have to understand it labrador
[08:03:54] <writeback[m]> yippeekaiyay: so can highschoolers
[08:03:57] <yippeekaiyay> He gets in chatrooms like these and asks questions when he gets stuck
[08:04:03] <labrador> sdfgsdfg, where's the fun in that?
[08:04:04] <yippeekaiyay> And he can do stuff like SOX compliance
[08:04:10] <yippeekaiyay> Let's talk about that ...
[08:04:12] <sdfgsdfg> you can just keep it short and dumbed down and make it look like it includes amazing information
[08:04:18] <yippeekaiyay> How much CompSci is in Sox comliance?
[08:04:18] <writeback[m]> what in the world is sox compliance
[08:04:20] <labrador> Understanding stuff is the thing that feels good
[08:04:25] <yippeekaiyay> It is just htat
[08:04:29] <sdfgsdfg> and that's pretty much all those books in circulation
[08:04:32] <sdfgsdfg> right now anyways
[08:04:33] <writeback[m]> labrador: 100% this
[08:04:33] <yippeekaiyay> But feeling good and making money aren't the same thing
[08:04:36] *** Joins: HaMsTeRs (~Thunderbi@210.3.213.4)
[08:04:41] <yippeekaiyay> So, we established that. No disagreements
[08:04:47] <writeback[m]> slow down
[08:04:50] <yippeekaiyay> The next premise is that people in this room want to feel good
[08:04:53] <writeback[m]> i genuinely dont know who you are talking to
[08:04:56] <sdfgsdfg> I already feel good
[08:05:01] <writeback[m]> same
[08:05:03] <yippeekaiyay> I think I should have elected for that before taking the forensic job I have now which I hate
[08:05:16] <writeback[m]> elected for what
[08:05:17] <writeback[m]> feeling good about yourself?
[08:05:20] <yippeekaiyay> OK, so I was presumptuous
[08:05:24] <ghostbuster> you don't need calculus fo buffer overflows..
[08:05:36] <writeback[m]> ghostbuster: no they were talking about comp sci but you dont need comp sci for bof either
[08:05:38] <yippeekaiyay> That's part of the OSCP. That's the only cert I want
[08:05:45] <sdfgsdfg> I thought buffer overflows were patched a long time ago
[08:05:48] <sdfgsdfg> lol
[08:05:51] <yippeekaiyay> No, not at all!
[08:05:53] <yippeekaiyay> LOL
[08:05:56] <ajak> LOL
[08:05:56] <writeback[m]> dying breed
[08:05:58] <writeback[m]> but not gone
[08:06:03] <ghostbuster> they are patched but that just makes it harder to do, not impossible
[08:06:07] <yippeekaiyay> Even the stuff that Kevin Mitnick was doing in the '90s ... much of that can still be done
[08:06:11] <sdfgsdfg> cant even guess the address space
[08:06:31] <writeback[m]> kevin mitnick?!?!
[08:06:31] <writeback[m]> he's a fucking clown
[08:06:33] <yippeekaiyay> I read his book and he was social engineering people to access their .rhosts file
[08:06:36] <ghostbuster> new M1 apple chips the kernel is not even allowed to read user memory
[08:06:46] <yippeekaiyay> I'm not familiar with how that works, but I know enough to know that would still work in some systems
[08:06:47] <writeback[m]> yea he is a sociopath who glorifies his behavior and calls it
[08:06:50] <labrador> ghostbuster, that really makes no sense
[08:06:53] <writeback[m]> SOCIAL ENGINEERING
[08:06:54] <ghostbuster> called PAN
[08:06:57] <writeback[m]> i fucking hate that shit with a passion
[08:06:58] <sdfgsdfg> compiler security - if up to date - is quite secure and tough I think
[08:07:01] <ghostbuster> privilege access never
[08:07:03] <ghostbuster> lol
[08:07:05] <yippeekaiyay> OK, so there's that. Why do so many people hate him?
[08:07:06] <labrador> How does the kernel....stop itself....from accessing user mem?
[08:07:10] <yippeekaiyay> You all lay that down to me
[08:07:12] <sdfgsdfg> with those chip security stuff added at least
[08:07:15] <yippeekaiyay> My DevOps friend hates him too
[08:07:16] <sdfgsdfg> M1 whatnot
[08:07:17] <yippeekaiyay> WTF is that about
[08:07:18] <ghostbuster> labrador: not the kernel, the cpu stops the kernel
[08:07:25] <yippeekaiyay> Why do peole hate Kevin Mitnick?
[08:07:38] <labrador> ghostbuster, oh so cpu magic huh
[08:07:40] <labrador> nice

[08:10:53] <writeback[m]> lol
[08:10:59] <writeback[m]> its not cool because hes a felon

[08:17:18] <yippeekaiyay> *it's meth for middle-class kids
[08:17:18] <ajak> and obviously chemistry is difficult so not really "huhuh so close to meth"

[08:18:58] <yippeekaiyay> I found out 35 GB on my C:\ were being used as a page file
[08:18:58] <writeback[m]> 3 instances of vs, two vms,ida, bunch of chrome tabs, garbage electron apps and im still running smoothly
[08:19:00] <Millicent> bye bye performance
[08:19:03] <Millicent> 35GB :O
[08:19:05] <ajak> i've seen multiple conversations today about how bad the matrix federation servers are
[08:19:07] <Millicent> surely not actively
[08:19:11] <sdfgsdfg> you're on windows ?
[08:19:12] <writeback[m]> it's awful
[08:19:18] <sdfgsdfg> get out of here
[08:19:22] <writeback[m]> yeah take note guys
[08:19:38] <yippeekaiyay> I'm on WSL2
[08:19:41] <Millicent> labrador: haven't tried it yet, but I shall one day
[08:19:45] <sdfgsdfg> whats wsl
[08:19:49] <yippeekaiyay> So I'm on an Ubuntu hypervised shell
[08:19:59] <labrador> Not real gnu/linux
[08:19:59] <Millicent> it's a synthesised linux in powershell

[08:20:42] <labrador> So what was the problem
[08:20:46] <Millicent> I mean you could just install powershell on linux
[08:20:48] <writeback[m]> wsl2 is real linux
[08:20:49] <writeback[m]> btw
[08:20:51] <Millicent> or use a windows box in azure
[08:20:54] <sdfgsdfg> yes install powershell on linux
[08:20:58] <labrador> writeback[m], not gnu/linux
[08:21:00] <writeback[m]> its literally native linux via virtualiation
[08:21:01] <labrador> No freedom
[08:21:02] <writeback[m]> ok
[08:21:03] <writeback[m]> true
[08:21:03] <yippeekaiyay> It worked for awhile but I didn't like the quality of the emulation even using something like QUEM
[08:21:07] <sdfgsdfg> or don't attend an interview if you're going to get powershell questions
[08:21:08] <Millicent> writeback[m]: ah, I hadn't tried it, but that's good to know
[08:21:21] <yippeekaiyay> *QEMU
[08:21:24] <writeback[m]> wsl1 is a posix subsystem/emulation layer
[08:21:31] <writeback[m]> its like reverse WINE
[08:21:38] <writeback[m]> wsl2 is just hyperv which is pretty fast and comfy
[08:21:55] <writeback[m]> minus networking issues you get due to hyperv netwrok adapters never behaving right
[08:22:03] <yippeekaiyay> Well, if I A) don't annoy everyone with my ADHD shit and B) learn enough ... maybe I'll get the right interviews where I'm not getting asked PowerShell quetions.
[08:22:04] <writeback[m]> but that is all fixable given half an hour
[08:22:08] <yippeekaiyay> But, so far, they don't give a shit about bash
[08:22:16] <yippeekaiyay> I mention it and as far as it goes is the grep command
[08:22:23] <writeback[m]> man if youre interviewing for a position that wants powershell thats unfortunate

[08:23:05] <Millicent> stupid checksum offloading
[08:23:08] <Millicent> haha
[08:23:13] <writeback[m]> sad
[08:23:24] <writeback[m]> i dont know what checksum offloading is
[08:23:24] <yippeekaiyay> It's not really sad. It's just the reality.
[08:23:30] <writeback[m]> so ill laugh and agree
[08:23:33] <yippeekaiyay> I also don't know what that is
[08:23:47] <Millicent> oh, the main issue I've found with the broadcom adapters + similar was if you have ipv4 checksum offloading turned on, you'd drop packets randomly
[08:23:55] <yippeekaiyay> We all have moments in our life when we're not doing exactly what we want. At least I assume as much.
[08:24:01] <writeback[m]> my networking knowledge goes as far as using wireshark to proxy traffic when attempting to dev exploits and whatnot
[08:24:03] <Millicent> so turn off checksum offloading and all starts working; just took me a while to find out that's what was doing it
[08:24:15] <yippeekaiyay> I'm sure there's some privildged rich fuck out there who never did anything he didn't want to, even when he was seven-years-old ... but I'm not him
[08:24:25] <Millicent> fair; networking was my study and is like, half my job
[08:24:29] <yippeekaiyay> Love Wireshark!
[08:24:32] <writeback[m]> netsec?
[08:24:39] <writeback[m]> or actual network engineering
[08:24:43] <yippeekaiyay> But you need a NIC in promiscuous mode to have fun with it
[08:24:44] <Millicent> nah actual network
[08:24:55] <Millicent> netsec is where I'd like to end up, but just not enough demand locally atm
[08:24:56] <yippeekaiyay> Gotta have at least two adapters to really do anything with it, IMO
[08:25:05] <Millicent> started doing some defence consulting on the side to get a foot in the door
[08:25:21] <writeback[m]> cant wait for some linux nerd to chime in with "just tcpdump, bro"
[08:25:29] <writeback[m]> Millicent: good $$ in that shit for sure
[08:25:30] <yippeekaiyay> That came up in an interview
[08:25:40] <yippeekaiyay> He wanted to know how to do the equivalent of Wireshark on LInux
[08:25:43] <writeback[m]> at least, those i know who do contracting get paid well
[08:25:44] <Millicent> yeah definitely, I'm in a privileged position in that regard for sure
[08:25:47] <yippeekaiyay> Literally just came up a few weeks ago
[08:25:49] <Millicent> helpful, due to single income + pandemic etc
[08:25:50] <writeback[m]> tshark
[08:26:01] <yippeekaiyay> Right ... but tcpdump is even more raw
[08:26:06] <ajak> .. wireshark is the equivalent of wireshark on linux
[08:26:24] <writeback[m]> ye but i assume his question was "cli wireshark" which would be a strange interview question
[08:26:25] <yippeekaiyay> But it's easier to install tcpdump, no?
[08:26:27] <yippeekaiyay> Never mind
[08:26:32] <writeback[m]> answer would be tcpdump but tshark does exist
[08:26:46] <Millicent> tshark is my preferred but tcpdump is more readily available sometimes
[08:27:02] <yippeekaiyay> OK, and I didn't even know I knew that until you all just mentioned it.

[08:29:58] <yippeekaiyay> Interesting!
[08:30:02] <yippeekaiyay> What is your major?
[08:30:19] <writeback[m]> electrical engineering

[08:30:47] <yippeekaiyay> That's actually sort of a metalevel above CompSci since the electrical engineers built the hardware originally
[08:30:52] <yippeekaiyay> Well, like 40-50 years ago
[08:30:57] <Millicent> writeback[m]: yeah networking is useful, but not necessarily my fav thing to do in the world :P definitely found it helpful knowledge though
[08:30:57] <yippeekaiyay> That's the way I see it anyway
[08:31:04] <writeback[m]> engineering students are elitists
[08:31:16] <writeback[m]> dont listen to the nonsense they spout
[08:31:33] <yippeekaiyay> I think all math people are elitist. I'm sure the general public would say all of us and our Linux bullshit are elitist
[08:31:41] <writeback[m]> yes, it's more coursework then most majors, yes it's really time consuming and you need alot of credits, but it is not like youre a doctor
[08:31:42] <ajak> writeback[m]: what if CS is under ENGR :(
[08:31:49] <yippeekaiyay> My wife luckily just thinks I'm a nerd. She bought me a Linux shirt for our anniversary

[08:32:05] <labrador> yippeekaiyay, freedom is not elitist
[08:32:12] <writeback[m]> usually it is its own thing
[08:32:13] <labrador> Its work is to give others more freedom
[08:32:17] <yippeekaiyay> All subjective either way
[08:32:25] <yippeekaiyay> These things we're speaking of are severely relative
[08:32:27] <labrador> Na freedom's not subjective
[08:32:39] <writeback[m]> at one school i was accepted to, they had CS labeled as this: "Computer Science - Liberal arts"
[08:32:40] <writeback[m]> and it was a large state school too
[08:32:43] <labrador> lmao
[08:32:45] <writeback[m]> made me laugh
[08:33:01] <yippeekaiyay> That's marketing, man
[08:33:12] <yippeekaiyay> OK, so I was a freelance journalist in the early 2000s
[08:33:18] <writeback[m]> low level stuff and computers were just a passion i took on during covid
[08:33:20] <yippeekaiyay> I wrote for a Pulitzer-winning newspaper
[08:33:32] <yippeekaiyay> The journalism department at my first school was in the social sciences division

[08:33:52] <labrador> writeback[m], oh ok
[08:33:56] <yippeekaiyay> When I went to the main campus, it had it's own department but it's always in something different depending on the school
[08:33:58] <writeback[m]> and you can get pretty knowledgable in barely 1.5 years

[08:37:12] <yippeekaiyay> No judgements on that. In the U.S., peole rarely use the word math in the plural
[08:37:16] <writeback[m]> we'd be saying "yea gimme 30 mins just finishing uip all my homework for calculus"

[08:38:42] <writeback[m]> wait that makes way more sense then math
[08:38:45] <writeback[m]> why do us americans call it math

[08:43:51] <ghostbuster> go is a good language for building things but not sure it's the best to learn first if security/re is your goal
[08:43:55] <writeback[m]> not shitting on you
[08:44:03] <yippeekaiyay> Ok, but Go is used for Android shit, yes?
[08:44:08] <yippeekaiyay> And used in the Cloud
[08:44:12] <yippeekaiyay> *cloud
[08:44:13] <symb0l> Android? No
[08:44:15] <writeback[m]> thats java
[08:44:18] <symb0l> Java/kotlin
[08:44:24] <labrador> Kotlin is not cool
[08:44:24] <yippeekaiyay> OK, I stand corrected
[08:44:27] <labrador> Java is
[08:44:29] <yippeekaiyay> But it is used in cloud environments a lot
[08:44:32] <yippeekaiyay> That's what Google says
[08:44:42] <symb0l> Yeah, most cloud tooling is built on Go
[08:44:42] <labrador> Well google makes go sooooo
[08:44:51] <yippeekaiyay> I was thinking about doing the bug bounties but I found out they don't pay shit
[08:44:52] <symb0l> K8s/containerd/etc
[08:44:52] <writeback[m]> just write ocaml so you can be cool and contribute to BAP/all of the magic tooling CMU writes papers on
[08:44:55] <writeback[m]> 😏jk
[08:44:56] <yippeekaiyay> so that idea died super quick
[08:45:03] <yippeekaiyay> I finally researched the bounty pay-outs
[08:45:16] <writeback[m]> very very few researchers can live off bounties
[08:45:23] <writeback[m]> the ones that can are extremely well versed in their specific area
[08:45:29] <writeback[m]> e.g windows 0day researchers
[08:45:35] <writeback[m]> but they usually end up getting really good jobs, so
[08:45:37] <writeback[m]> 🤷
[08:45:40] <yippeekaiyay> that's like H.D. Moore
[08:45:45] <writeback[m]> idk who that is
[08:45:55] <labrador> me too
[08:45:58] <symb0l> Yeah, did bounties for awhile, then got a RE job. best decision ever

[08:48:41] <yippeekaiyay> What other computer job pays people to do bad things where they can be open about it etc
[08:48:45] <writeback[m]> its not as glamorous as it seems
[08:48:48] <writeback[m]> lol
[08:48:57] <symb0l> I did pentesting for years, and got so bored of doing the same shit over and over. Went research / RE and it's been great.
[08:49:03] <yippeekaiyay> Well, I have met pentester humans
[08:49:12] <writeback[m]> symb0l: yeah thats my goal
[08:49:22] <yippeekaiyay> The only human I socialized with in-person was a huge prick. But I think that was a feature of him - more so to do with his craft.
[08:49:34] <writeback[m]> i actually just started freshman year of school and have been trying to line up internships with some researchers i know online
[08:49:37] <yippeekaiyay> He was a total stoner and he said, "how else could I sit here and study code for hours."
[08:49:42] <writeback[m]> hopefully i can do some cool shit
[08:49:48] <writeback[m]> yippeekaiyay: sounds like a loser

[08:50:38] <yippeekaiyay> When I was 18, I wasn't hanging out in cool chatrooms like this
[08:51:00] <yippeekaiyay> I suppose, in theory, if you keep hanging out here and places like this. You learn stuff, don't fall into decadence during your college plight
[08:51:05] <yippeekaiyay> ... Yes, you'll do very very well
[08:51:11] <yippeekaiyay> I assume there's consensus on this
[08:51:14] <writeback[m]> hanging out in chatrooms

[08:51:33] <writeback[m]> if i want to discuss topics of interest i have people i know personally i talk to, i'm just killing time and bantering here

[08:51:43] <labrador> Well kindof
[08:51:45] <labrador> lol
[08:51:50] <yippeekaiyay> It helps deal with isolation and you learn things
[08:52:10] <yippeekaiyay> Well, shit, I deactivated my Facebook account about two years ago so I wouldn't know anymore.
[08:52:13] <symb0l> We have internships and huge RE challenge that we get a lot of students through
[08:52:13] <writeback[m]> dude, discord/matrix/irc is not a text editor or debugger
[08:52:15] <writeback[m]> so you aren't gonna learn shit on here
[08:52:22] <yippeekaiyay> I might have to reactivate it as a friend from HS died and I wanna know what happened.

[08:59:30] <yippeekaiyay> High capacity compute? Two to three hypervisors running Linux to test networking features then a third hypervisor running Windows on the same box
[08:59:37] <symb0l> Also if you're a student, sign up for AWS, spin some shit up, and then when they send you a bill say 'im sorry i didnt know how to use AWS am student'

[09:49:56] <yippeekaiyay> It's severely flawed in how inefficient it is

[10:31:33] <yippeekaiyay> See, this all makes sense to us. But my wife would not have this
[10:32:07] <yippeekaiyay> I was spending about 4-5 hours watching TV but now I watch hockey and don't pay attention as I'm on my laptop at the same time
[10:32:15] <labrador> who cares yippeekaiyay what the dumb avg american wants? they cant even operate windows
[10:32:23] <yippeekaiyay> So, it's really watching hockey every 20-30 minutes while I'm not in the shell

[10:44:03] <yippeekaiyay> ... see if you can help this guy
[10:44:19] <yippeekaiyay> I am trying to help him but it's not like you can just break through TLS
[10:44:21] <yippeekaiyay> I did my best
[10:44:27] <labrador> Is this guy mitm'ing someone?
[10:44:31] <labrador> Why would I help him
[10:44:35] <yippeekaiyay> NO, he's just an innocent person
[10:44:49] <yippeekaiyay> No, I'm helping him ... Shit, I don't know anything about the initial poster.
[10:44:59] <labrador> TLS encryption on emails is only on mail relays
[10:45:03] <labrador> the message is plain text

[10:45:13] <labrador> Idk whats his problem
[10:45:15] <yippeekaiyay> I tried helping him. Now when you're saying that ... shit, should I worry that he's doing something sketchy. He looks like a non-technical user being spammed or harassed.

[10:47:33] <yippeekaiyay> Actually, I think you do the cloning with SET on Kali
[10:48:07] <yippeekaiyay> OK, so if this person is a blackhat, why wouldn't he know this?

[10:51:30] <labrador> Yes true,but only for the relays themselves
[10:51:33] <yippeekaiyay> But inspecting an email isn't like a hacker vs script kiddie thing. Anyone can open up the header and view the original
[10:51:38] <labrador> Eveyone else on the net cannot see it
[10:51:41] <labrador> Its tls encrypted
[10:51:46] <labrador> Between the relays
[10:51:54] <yippeekaiyay> Right ... So I don't know what he's talking about
[10:51:58] <labrador> yeah
[10:52:06] <yippeekaiyay> He wants to trace the public IP of the sender
[10:52:18] <yippeekaiyay> You can't just get that by inspecting the original
[10:52:19] *** Quits: franck (~franck@82-64-88-134.subs.proxad.net) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[10:52:30] <labrador> which is impossible without decrypting the message
[10:52:38] <yippeekaiyay> In many cases, you'll just see the IP of the DNS server of the email provider
[10:52:53] <yippeekaiyay> So, if the email was sent from a gmail account, the sending IP will be from a Google server
[10:53:00] <yippeekaiyay> But it's not going to show the original sender's actual IP
[10:53:10] <labrador> A lot of mail servers
[10:53:12] <labrador> Like riseup
[10:53:15] <yippeekaiyay> Go ahead
[10:53:18] <labrador> Dont include the sender ip
[10:53:19] <labrador> At all
[10:53:25] <labrador> They delete it
[10:53:28] <yippeekaiyay> I've never even heard of riseup

[10:55:10] <yippeekaiyay> This also came up in a job interview. And, I keep thinking after the interview long ago passed ... I spent some time looking at phishing emails, just to freshen up. Looking for phishing IPs isn't something that all cyber people even take the time to do ...

[10:56:05] <yippeekaiyay> Dumb shit question to ask in an interview
[10:56:17] *** Joins: HyNoX (~HyNoX@151.57.171.100)
[10:56:20] <labrador> not really,you cannot deal with phishing emails taht easily
[10:56:23] <yippeekaiyay> Ask questions that don't have simple answers
[10:56:26] <yippeekaiyay> ... How do you do?
[10:56:31] <yippeekaiyay> Me: "On which OS."
[10:56:49] <yippeekaiyay> The interviewer gets all riled up, "On Windows - and for the rest of the questions, assume it's on Windows"
[10:57:18] <yippeekaiyay> What do you mean you can't deal with them
[10:57:40] <yippeekaiyay> You can just run the whois command if you suspect a phish and report the IP to the DNS server used to send the email
[10:57:54] <yippeekaiyay> Of course, the lazy SysAdmin reading the email can't and won't do shit but you could do that?
[10:58:10] <labrador> So the sending mta?
[10:58:15] <labrador> What does a dns server here
[10:58:15] <yippeekaiyay> Find the abuse contact from the command output
[10:58:16] <labrador> even mean
[10:58:25] *** Joins: p0indexter (~alpha@user/p0indexter)
[10:58:34] <labrador> Yeah you could contact the sending mta sure
[10:58:42] <labrador> If it keeps logs that is
[10:59:04] <yippeekaiyay> Well, I was just assuming that the IP of the first server won't show up and only the name server will appear but that's not necessarily the case
[10:59:10] <yippeekaiyay> I also don't look at phishing emails all day
[10:59:34] <yippeekaiyay> I just know for myself, I know when my IP leaks ... and if it's leaking, it leaks through the DNS server - not through my VPN
[10:59:58] <yippeekaiyay> The DNS server picks up the packet if or when I'm not using a good server
[11:00:53] <yippeekaiyay> I quit using standard servers like 8.8.8.8 or 8.8.4.4 or 208.67.220.220
[11:01:00] <yippeekaiyay> So that's Google and OpenDNS
[11:01:00] <labrador> use quad9
[11:01:04] <labrador> or libreDNS
[11:01:08] <yippeekaiyay> ... No, I use the server for my VPN
[11:01:13] <yippeekaiyay> Mostly because I'm lazy
[11:01:17] <labrador> Thats just shifting trust
[11:01:21] <labrador> wahts your vpn?
[11:01:44] <yippeekaiyay> I have friends and have had coworkers who build their own VPNs and pay for an offshore VPS but I suspect the performance in that regard is diminished.
[11:01:59] <yippeekaiyay> Also, I pay for a VPN provider so I can change servers and countries when I want
[11:02:07] <labrador> Whats your vpn provider lol
[11:02:12] <yippeekaiyay> I dare not say
[11:02:16] <labrador> Can they even be trusted?
[11:02:17] <yippeekaiyay> It's in the top five though
[11:02:21] <labrador> You can say that here
[11:02:23] <yippeekaiyay> They've been hacked so probably not
[11:02:30] <yippeekaiyay> They're not in the five eyes though
[11:02:37] <labrador> Probably nord
[11:02:39] <labrador> I guess
[11:02:54] <labrador> The better ones are proton and mullvad
[11:03:01] <yippeekaiyay> I will neither confirm nor deny whether or not it's Nord
[11:03:03] <yippeekaiyay> LOL
[11:03:08] <yippeekaiyay> So you do what you will with that
[11:03:23] <labrador> Its not private info man
[11:03:24] <labrador> but ok
[11:03:35] <yippeekaiyay> I told that to my sister on the phone the other day about something and she said, "Well, if you're not denying it, you're confirming it," LOL
[11:03:40] <yippeekaiyay> Well, no, it's not
[11:03:40] <labrador> nope
[11:03:44] <labrador> Thats the best way
[11:03:51] <yippeekaiyay> And telling someone your VPN doesn't do much unless you have a dedicated IP
[11:04:07] <yippeekaiyay> If you're using somthing like ExpressVPN or Nord, your IP is shared by thousands of other users
[11:04:10] <yippeekaiyay> So it's sort of useless
[11:04:11] <labrador> but vpns mostly dont do shit
[11:04:13] <labrador> Except tor
[11:04:21] <yippeekaiyay> I think you're secretly Mr. Snowden
[11:04:23] <labrador> that makes life better

[11:04:36] <yippeekaiyay> He says it in his autobiography
[11:04:38] <labrador> I can't confirm or deny
[11:04:40] <labrador> hehe
[11:04:44] <yippeekaiyay> LMFAO
[11:04:50] <yippeekaiyay> Well, OK, so let's talk about Tor
[11:04:54] <yippeekaiyay> ...You're using Tor
[11:04:57] <labrador> nope
[11:04:59] <labrador> Not now
[11:05:01] <yippeekaiyay> You're on a fiber connection
[11:05:06] <yippeekaiyay> ... You're paying for a gig speed
[11:05:06] <labrador> Libera knows my ip
[11:05:11] <yippeekaiyay> You're waiting for your speed
[11:05:14] <yippeekaiyay> You're on your Tor
[11:05:18] <yippeekaiyay> What's your max download?
[11:05:24] <labrador> pretty low
[11:05:28] <yippeekaiyay> Right ...
[11:05:29] <labrador> Like 100kbps
[11:05:34] <labrador> Who cares
[11:05:38] <labrador> TOr aint for that
[11:05:43] <yippeekaiyay> So you paid, what, $120 a month for a 100kbps connectin ...
[11:05:47] <yippeekaiyay> Yeah, I can'd do that
[11:06:05] <yippeekaiyay> Plus, I can't run Tor on my phone without just using something like Brave and technically that's a Tor browser proxy
[11:06:19] <yippeekaiyay> I don't even know if Brave will do that on a phone but I was thinking of it
[11:06:29] <yippeekaiyay> And I can't run Tor on my Firestick

[11:07:32] <labrador> Nope brave is bad
[11:07:33] <labrador> for tor
[11:07:33] <yippeekaiyay> You have an OS that runs off of RAM with no changelogs
[11:07:37] <yippeekaiyay> What a pain in the ass is that
[11:07:44] <labrador> The only way to use tor is to use the tor browser
[11:07:58] <labrador> That depends on your security needs
[11:07:58] <yippeekaiyay> You can also use Qubes
[11:08:02] <labrador> Not everyone needs to use tails
[11:08:05] <labrador> or qubes
[11:08:07] <labrador> or whonix
[11:08:15] <yippeekaiyay> Or that ...
[11:08:37] <yippeekaiyay> At one point I was so cheap and lazy that to break through the New York Times paywall, I was using Whonix only to read NYT articles
[11:08:40] <yippeekaiyay> I'll admit that
[11:09:17] <labrador> I also use adblock
[11:09:21] <labrador> Never watch ads
[11:09:31] <yippeekaiyay> I have only used Tor a little bit and the only reason I used it is that I got curious as to what is really on the onion sites
[11:09:41] <yippeekaiyay> Not doing anything blackhat but just poking around seeing what all the fuss is about
[11:09:44] <labrador> yippeekaiyay, you should use it more
[11:09:49] <labrador> Also tor isnt for hacking
[11:09:55] <labrador> Please don use it for illegal stuff
[11:09:58] <yippeekaiyay> I thought to use it properly you have to run a local server
[11:09:58] <labrador> please
[11:10:07] <yippeekaiyay> I wonder if Snowden, for instance, is just using it in his browser
[11:10:17] <labrador> everyone runs a tor local server
[11:10:17] <yippeekaiyay> Man, I don't
[11:10:23] <labrador> Do a systemctl status tor

[15:36:28] <yippeekaiyay> Typically, when a script is run, if the script is merely a series of commands, each command won't run until the last one is finished. Meaning, there's not going to be a zero exit code unless every command executes. Yet, if I'm running two commands in Linux to run consecutively e.g., sudo apt update -y && sudo apt upgrade -y, I'm using the apersands to make sure the second command won't execute
[15:36:30] <yippeekaiyay> unless the first one is successful
[15:36:40] <yippeekaiyay> ... Or else, I would just use <;>
[15:37:07] <yippeekaiyay> However, in some cases, a script has to contain a wait command or else multiple programs won't launch appropriately
[15:37:35] <yippeekaiyay> Why the need for the wait command in some cases and why is it that the && operative doesn't have to be used often in regular bash scripts.
