[00:06:29] <mokulus> I'm installing arch on uefi laptop with nvme ssd, it had windows previously. EFI partition is only 100 MB and mkinitcpio -P fails with not enough space left
[00:06:45] <mokulus> what can I do?
[00:07:13] <NetSysFire> you can wipe it and make a new efi partition
[00:07:16] <mokulus> EFI folder is 52 M
[00:07:22] <mokulus> wont I brick it?
[00:07:41] <NetSysFire> no, it isnt bootable but you got the archiso anyways
[00:07:48] <NetSysFire> so you can always recover
[00:07:59] *** Joins: achilleas (~ach@user/achilleas)
[00:08:03] <mokulus> are you sure?
[00:08:17] <NetSysFire> very sure
[00:08:40] <NetSysFire> if you put a completely blank disk into your laptop, it wont brick
[00:08:54] <NetSysFire> it will complain it cant boot, but you usually insert an usb and install an OS then
[00:09:04] <mikebutash> just do a secure wipe and start over really
[00:09:12] <mokulus> it had windows on it before
[00:09:29] <mikebutash> just give efi a gig or so, then you'll never run out
[00:09:37] <NetSysFire> i wouldnt do a secure wipe, its unnecessary
[00:09:38] <mikebutash> do you want to keep windoze on it?
[00:09:41] <mokulus> alright, for some reason i got a feeling that there is something important on efi partition and removing it will brick the laptop
[00:09:59] <NetSysFire> no, the important stuff is in the efivarfs which you cant remove easily and is hidden in the kernel
[00:10:06] <NetSysFire> the esp is fairly unimportant
[00:10:15] <NetSysFire> so start anew unless you want to keep windows
[00:10:29] <mokulus> alright

The wiki details a layout compatible with Snapper, but the wiki says it is not compatible with `snapper rollback` and it appears quite a few people want `the opensuse layout` so they can use `snapper rollback`.

[02:30:50] <jonascj> MrElendig Good point about snapper. I don't want to use snapper per say, I was just attracted to btrfs by the snapshot feature in general and the possibility of taking a snapshot before e.g. upgrading and rolling back (somehow) if something went completely wrong.

[02:35:20] <jonascj> alright, maybe it would be good to start out manually taking snapshots etc. before having it automated with snapper and snap-pac.
[02:36:20] <lastmikoi> never made snapshots on my archlinux laptop but I always use LVM snapshots on the hypervisor for my RHEL VMs, what's the added value of a specialized FS compared to lv snapshots ?
[02:36:42] <MrElendig> lastmikoi: lighter
[02:36:56] <MrElendig> also instant
[02:37:15] <lastmikoi> interesting
[02:38:25] <MrElendig> the cow nature of btrfs makes (most) snaphots basically instant, and since only the differences are stored, really space efficient for small changes
[02:38:59] <MrElendig> downside is of course that they are not fully duplicated, so a corruption in the "main" dataset can ruin your snapshot too
[02:39:11] <jonascj> Booting snapshots with grub seems cool but I'm not yet sure if people use it as a way of rolling / back to a snapshot or just a way to boot through history (intending to return to the current state of the filesystem eventually).
[02:39:49] <lastmikoi> lvm snapshots are cow too ain't they ?
[02:40:12] <MrElendig> kinda, and at the block level
[02:40:30] <MrElendig> doesn't know that is data and what is "free" space/garbage
[02:40:58] <mongy> timeshift does a good job too tbh.
[02:41:20] <mongy> and the autosnap thing on upgrade
[02:42:30] <lastmikoi> gotcha

[02:45:43] <jonascj> If the whole `snapper rollback` and opensuse layout thing is about having to manipulate snapshots/subvolumes with an external system (e.g. liveusb) vs. just using `snapper rollback` and reboot...

[05:47:36] <thurstylark> pgimeno: are you using libvirt as well?
[05:47:47] <pgimeno> I don't know, I guess I am not?
[05:47:58] <thurstylark> how do you start your vm?
[05:48:07] <pgimeno> with aqemu
[05:48:30] <thurstylark> then no libvirt
[05:49:03] <kevr> is there a particular reason you aren't using libvirt?
[05:49:43] <pgimeno> yes, that I don't even know what it is
[05:49:52] <kevr> you can technically still setup qxl without, but libvirt is a lot more out of the box.
[05:49:56] <thurstylark> ^
[05:50:11] <thurstylark> I'd suggest migrating to it. shouldn't be too hard

[05:50:25] <thurstylark> especially if you want gui management
[05:51:00] <thurstylark> shouldn't have to do too much more than creating a new vm and pointing it at your existing disk image
[05:51:49] <pgimeno> http://www.formauri.es/personal/pgimeno/pastes/aqemu-cmd-line.txt is what aqemu says it uses to launch qemu

[05:57:50] <kevr> pgimeno: tl;dr version - libvirtd is a daemon that libvirt communicates with, it basically allows you to store persistent settings for your vms, and because it's meant to be a sort of centralized location for vm configs, it depends on and sets up a lot of other backends that you would otherwise have to do yourself.
[05:58:08] *** Joins: mrbanie (~mrbanie@user/mrbanie)
[05:58:18] <kevr> so when you start a vm through libvirt, it just starts the vm with the configuration that it knows about it
[05:58:42] <kevr> helps a lot for managing multiple vms, and not writing a management system yourself for configs (cli launch settings)
[05:59:08] <bq> Every time I connect my BT headset it comes up in HFP profile, rather than A2DP. This didn't used to be the case - how do I get it to stick?
[05:59:17] <kevr> it just bundles up most everything you'll need for anything in qemu
[06:00:08] <kevr> there's a program called virt-manager that then uses libvirt to let you manage vms in a GUI utility

[11:41:36] <GuiToris> hey, since I migrated from intel to nvidia, my computer acts strangely. There are lot of issues. I was wondering if this is because it's a optimus laptop, or nvidia support is very poor on Linux
[11:42:00] <GuiToris> I remember Linus flipping the bird, but it was ages ago
[11:42:13] <sheep> optimus is still a pain to deal with
[11:42:30] <GuiToris> I turned intel off
[11:42:39] <GuiToris> nvidia is my primary gpu card
[11:42:56] <GuiToris> and this is strange, but intel was better
[11:43:04] <sheep> if I remember correctly, in optimus setups, the intel GPU still controls the laptop display, and the nvidia GPU is not connected to the display

[11:47:12] <thurstylark> by far
[11:47:14] <sheep> it can use DRM_PRIME though which improves performance somewhat on optimus setups

I'm wondering if uploading a malicious package to AUR with the same name as an official package is a feasible attack scenario against such AUR helpers.

[18:07:51] <shan> both of you make great points
[18:07:56] <MacGyver> *That* is the drawback of rolling release.

[18:11:30] <MacGyver> There's two types of sysadmins: those who hate their life every year or two when they have to sit down and upgrade debian-based system in one go, and those who do life-hate-management by upgrading their rolling release for a few hours every week at most.

[18:12:55] <MacGyver> There's always an Arch-option, but it's not always provided by the service provider ;)

[23:04:47] <ayekat> don't expect there to be some magical automatic way for cleaning up the mess created manually
[23:05:01] <thrice> like, I have "powerdevil" for KDE, but I never call any command
[23:05:03] <Thursday> ðŸ¥²
[23:05:15] <thrice> yet, I need it

[23:05:37] <thrice> same with icons, or fonts, or...

[23:06:10] <Thursday> I have 240...

[23:06:59] <thrice> OK, still not awful to spend 5 minutes once a year or something

[23:07:08] <MrElendig> Thursday: the "didn't used" part is basically unsolveable
[23:07:24] <MrElendig> not without setting up instrumentation beforehand
[23:07:51] *** Joins: pjbass (~pj@45.43.71.21)
[23:07:59] <Thursday> MrElendig: so I think about stat tool to check every binary file to get files that were untouched for a long time
[23:08:25] <thrice> again, not everything has binaries
[23:08:33] <MrElendig> also noatime and other fun
[23:08:40] <MrElendig> +things
[23:08:45] <thrice> and just because a file isn't touched, doesn't mean you don't need it
[23:09:02] <MrElendig> and things getting accessed automaticly even though you are not actually using them
[23:09:35] <ayekat> und just limiting to "binary file" (I assume stuff in /usr/bin) will miss anything not installing any executables (or installing them elsewhere)
