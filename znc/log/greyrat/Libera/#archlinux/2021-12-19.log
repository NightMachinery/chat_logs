[03:33:08] <Thursday> alad lol thx
[03:33:15] <u0_a2771> is the life hours part, how long the drive has ran? 
[03:33:17] <MacGyver> yaymukund: I think my laptop drains on the order of 5% of battery in 8 hours of deep sleep.
[03:33:31] <MacGyver> yaymukund: But could be more like 10, I might be under-estimating here.

[03:33:59] <MacGyver> yaymukund: RAM needs to be continually refreshed to retain the information in it, so that's the main power drain during deep sleep.
[03:34:10] <kevr> u0_a2771: we'll need to look at specifically how they treat the error rate field, something looks off
[03:34:13] <kevr> let's see
[03:34:46] <u0_a2771> kevr ok? sorry kinda going over my head
[03:34:48] <kevr> yeah, it's totally fine

[03:35:49] <yaymukund> MacGyver: wow! Mine loses all the battery overnight (from a full charge)
[03:35:49] <kevr> u0_a2771:   9 Power_On_Hours          0x0032   072   072   000    Old_age   Always       -       20748
[03:35:57] <kevr> 20748 hours it says
[03:35:57] <yaymukund> or almost all, at least 75%
[03:36:07] <u0_a2771> I remember, there were power surges detected like a week ago. Maybe related to that? one of ram sticks died too, but I ignored it cause it was like an decade old from an old pc
[03:36:09] <kevr> that would b e....
[03:36:17] <kevr> 2.368 years
[03:36:24] <MacGyver> yaymukund: *Then* you should probably look at the journal, see whether it wakes up.
[03:36:37] <kevr> u0_a2771: it could be power supply related.
[03:36:37] <MacGyver> Or see whether it even successfully enters deep sleep or "hangs" somewhere.
[03:36:59] <kevr> u0_a2771: the power supply in a computer is what is responsible for regulating the power coming from your wall into power that your computer uses

[03:37:08] <kevr> if something in there gets fucked, it can screw the regulation
[03:37:21] <yaymukund> MacGyver: thank you! `journalctl -b` ? I'll run an experiment tonight
[03:37:25] <u0_a2771> yeah, now I'm scared to keep the system on
[03:37:51] <MacGyver> yaymukund: Assuming it hasn't drained the battery entirely, i.e. it hasn't rebooted, yes.
[03:38:02] <kevr> i'd personally not care much, the majority of psus these days have ground casing on them and are safe from leaking live
[03:38:12] <kevr> i guess if you're paranoid you could test it yourselfg
[03:38:15] <kevr> but it's a bit complex
[03:38:20] <MacGyver> yaymukund: What you usually expect to see is, from the moment you *enter* sleep, it stops logging.

[03:38:53] <kevr> also, buck regulators regulate down, it doesn't all of a sudden get damaged and output 500V or something
[03:38:56] <MacGyver> yaymukund: And then when you resume it, it starts again -- so the timestamps on *entering* sleep are usually the timestamp you are actually *resuming from* sleep.
[03:39:15] <kevr> if it gets damaged, it would just fail to regulate properly, giving less power than the machine needs
[03:39:34] <kevr> but there are a bunch of different parts of PSUs, any one of those sections getting damaged will make things problematic
[03:39:39] <u0_a2771> I see, then did the ram die on its own?
[03:39:44] <MacGyver> yaymukund: So don't be surprised at log entries like "CPU 1 is now offline" timestamped with the *resume*, rather than the suspend.
[03:39:48] <kevr> i can't tell you that
[03:40:16] <kevr> i'm not sure what happened in your computer, i'm not sure how electricity travelled, i'm not sure what kind of ram you have, i'm not sure, i'm not sure

[03:45:09] <kevr> u0_a2771: perhaps see if you can reach out to your PSU company and ask them about it, i wonder if you have a limited warranty that still technically can be used.
[03:45:15] <kevr> they might be able to help you out
[03:45:17] <kevr> it's worth a shot
[03:45:41] <u0_a2771> it was like 2 years warranty, maybe I can get it replaced
[03:45:45] <kevr> exactly!
[03:45:48] <kevr> that's perfect
[03:46:04] <u0_a2771> great, that gives some hope XD 
[03:46:06] <kevr> keep in mind though, we aren't sure if your PSU is actually a problem or not. We are just covering what _could_ be a problem.
[03:46:30] <u0_a2771> you didnt have to scare me like that again
[03:46:37] <kevr> sudden shutoffs and freezes could indicate the computer is getting less power than it wants, but it also could indicate other possibilities.
[03:47:00] <kevr> processor could even play a part there, ram could play a part

[03:49:16] <pounce> had a lot of audio issues on this desktop for particular kernel versions. switching to LTS semeed to fix it but it doesn't anymore. im currently using wireplumber but have had issues with pulse/pms too. any ideas on how to debug?

[03:49:47] <Namarrgon> downgrade the kernel until you find one that works again
[03:49:56] <pounce> isn't that terribly unsupported
[03:50:10] <Namarrgon> the kernel is relatively self-contained
[03:50:11] <MacGyver> It's the one partial upgrade that somewhat hemi-demi is.
[03:50:22] <kevr> u0_a2771: this is tough, normally with these kinds of issues i use a separate known-good system to test individual parts
[03:50:28] <pounce> maybe i'll try updating to a new kernel first
[03:50:34] <MacGyver> As long as you don't go too far down so systemd doesn't choke.
[03:50:37] <Namarrgon> if you use out-of-tree kernel modules you might have to switch to their -dkms version
[03:50:37] <kevr> but you most likely don't have that option

[04:42:12] <MacGyver> naicam|ne: There's a very simple reason for that: you no longer have any kernel modules for your running kernel.

[08:44:48] <thurstylark> the step between 3.9 and 3.10 is the major version step, so yes. python 2 and python 3 are basically different languages

[08:48:26] <thurstylark> alschaapman: a change of "major version" usually means api-breaking changes, so I'm not sure where the confusion is
[08:49:01] <alschaapman> thurstylark: The confusion is that the software that I had based on python that stopped working after 3.9 -> 3.10 resumed working after rebuilding with no underlying code changes
[08:49:33] <alschaapman> So where's the API breakage? Just doesn't affect this software in particular? Is the breakage likely to only affect some software based on python? Etc
[08:50:28] <alschaapman> It's getting down to the difference between "if you wrote something based on the old version, it might be broken if you used X feature or subset of features" and "this release breaks a ton of shit from the old version"

[22:18:14] <krumelmonster> thanks bud, I'll take a look. I'll also look into pipewire Foxboron. For now I just tried Vital synth which doesn't require Jack so it works however with the keyboard I noticed that my bluetooth amp for which I installed pulseaudio-bluetooth has a latency of about 500ms+ so this wasn't fun to play. Has anyone ever experienced such issues? It might just be a design issue of the amp, but how could I tell?

[22:28:38] <krumelmonster> Foxboron I measured the latency by creating a test sound in audacity in one track and then recording during playback. Using internal speakers, there's virtually no latency, with bluetooth it's the 500ms. Is there really any way other than pulseaudio-bluetooth?
[22:29:42] <Foxboron> you are running a test through two different pulse modules. You are still largely bound to how pulse implements the codecs for bluetooth
[22:32:35] <teraflops> there are more codecs apart from sbc

[22:37:21] <krumelmonster> teraflops, Foxboron: I switched to pulseaudio-modules-bt (AUR) which got it down to ~150ms using sbc. In pavucontrol I can select other codecs but they're shown as unavailable (e.g. LDAC although libldac is installed). I assume this means the device doesn't support them?..
[22:37:41] <Foxboron> krumelmonster: most likely, yes

[23:48:14] <BrainDamage> even if in practice you won't use it anywhere
[23:48:34] <Flexyjerkov> so wayland has got itself embedded and no way of removing it?

[23:49:28] <Flexyjerkov> ah fair enough, it'll just have to stay
[23:49:39] <bud> it would get messy if all packages was provided both with and without wayland, we would have stuff like firefox , firefox-wayland etc
[23:49:40] <BrainDamage> wayland is a protocol, fyi, it's just libwayland with a bunch of defines
[23:49:47] <Flexyjerkov> i was trying to diagnose why it was that GTK applications always take about 30 seconds to open the first time
