[00:12:22] <acu> I am running PHP80 in FreeBSD and I want to run Posgtresql - however it seem that it is not working with either Postgres1l 14 or 13  -- only with 12 -- here is what I get
[00:12:28] <acu> this is the messages I get :   pkg install postgresql14-server   Updating FreeBSD repository catalogue...   FreeBSD repository is up to date. All repositories are up to date.

[00:13:39] <AllenJB> acu: This appears to be a distro specific packaging issue. I would recommend asking about it in a freebsd specific channel (you may also want to pastebin the output to make it easier to read)
[00:17:09] <acu> AllenJB: thank you - I will post on FreeBSD channel -

[01:23:57] <Sammitch> if I were to propose removing utf8_encode/decode functions from the language entirely, what are the odds of that RFC succeeding?
[01:24:17] <judah> Most likely zero

[01:24:55] <judah> Not that I think it should be in the language in the first place, but the folks with voting karma tend to be a bit more on the conservative side
[01:25:03] <judah> change = bad
[01:25:53] <Sammitch> but they are so incredibly badly named, and virtually only ever used to corrupt data because people misunderstand what they do
[01:26:06] <Sammitch> not to mention giving people the wrong idea about what UTF8 even is
[01:27:44] <Sammitch> or make give them optional source/destination encoding parameters that default to 'ISO-8859-1' and make it a passthrough to mb_convert_encoding()
[01:28:27] <__adrian> i thought there was talk lately about removing them
[01:28:28] <judah> These are all reasonable arguments

[01:29:06] <judah> I stopped tracking the internals mailing list a while back. It was great entertainment. I would scroll through threads while traveling. I just dont have the time for that anymore
[01:29:23] <judah> I do miss it sometimes, but they are posted online if the itch is there

[01:32:25] <AllenJB> That's a very old RFC. There has been much more recent discussion: https://externals.io/message/113645

[01:34:40] <__adrian> "Sammitch> or make give them optional source/destination encoding parameters"  // this is the correct BC option, btw. bravo

[02:18:16] <Sammitch> trick of the trade: if the result of a computation will never change you should probably think about caching it.
[02:18:55] <Sammitch> trying to get my devs on board with "maybe we don't need to constantly re-calculate slae reports from 2007" but I am not making headway =_=
[02:19:02] <Sammitch> *sales reports
[02:20:17] <judah> You see, the catch there is that developers only cost money. When you pitch this saying "look at this process that could make things better" what management hears is "we want you to budget in $$$ for us to save $"
[02:20:28] <judah> You gotta pitch it to the bean counters instead, their job is to save money
[02:20:55] <judah> "If we implement this change we will save xx minutes per developer per day" and let them be horrified at the amount of money you lose over the course of a year
[02:22:38] <judah> If it takes an extra 5 minutes per day for two developers, that rounds up to about an hour per week, or 52 hours of wasted effort per year. If each dev costs the company $75/hr that comes to $3,900 per year wasted, and thats not counting server time

[19:09:37] <AnrDaemon> tmic: What's wrong with phpdbg or xdebug?
[19:21:59] <arash> Hello, in phpinfo() there is no value for error_log, how can I set a path for it? Its a shared hosting account (I don't have root access) that use directadmin control panel
[19:22:32] <__adrian> in your php.ini file. if you don't have access, you'd need to talk to your hosting company's support team, or find a better host.
[19:24:29] <biberu> that actually sounds like indirectadmin
[19:24:53] <__adrian> i don't know anything about that CP
[19:24:57] <__adrian> but the host should
[19:26:14] <arash> so ini_set or using error_log function directly in the code is not working in this case?
[19:27:20] *** Joins: stenno (~stenno@user/stenno)
[19:28:44] <__adrian> ini_set can be used, but that won't be useful in some cases - i.e., if the error occurs before you can make that change; fatal errors, for example
[19:28:45] *** Quits: luigibu (~luigi@80.30.200.2) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[19:29:12] <__adrian> it's also just not the right approach. talk to your host and ask them to set it for you.
