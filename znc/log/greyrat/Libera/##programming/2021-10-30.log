[00:35:53] <_inky> i noticed back then that though you can join several channels in one thread
[00:36:11] <_inky> but you cannot know which channel you got message from.
[00:36:33] <_inky> so it makes sense if you join different channels, use different threads. of course using threads makes sense because of other reasons as well.

[04:34:26] <vdamewood> apotheon: Okay, I'll just make assumptions then. English used to have case, where nouns would inflect based on their role in the sentence (subject, object, indirect object, etc). English personal pronouns (and the interrogative pronoun who) retain case, while regular nouns have dropped case. The 's ending is a remnant of the 'genitive' case, which was originally -es. Since pronouns had their own genitive case, they don't use the -es ending
[04:34:26] <vdamewood>  which got shortened to -'s.

[04:57:20] <apotheon> Is that a reference to the difficulty of interoperating with the world outside the program?
[04:57:23] <euphrates[m]> Yes, obviously, but being purely functional is not a property reserved for functional languages then
[04:57:27] <oldlaptop> particularly since "imperative procedural langs" don't tend to treat functions as first-class values (though C's approach of letting you pass around pointers to functions works for some things)

[04:58:21] <oldlaptop> they also won't necessarily guarantee for you that recursion will *work*, even tail recursion
[04:58:36] <oldlaptop> (C certainly doesn't.)
[04:59:08] <apotheon> step one for pure functional programming in C: use C to write a pure functional programming language
[04:59:09] <euphrates[m]> it is used all the time though, it obviously does work. what do you mean by "guarantee"
[04:59:35] <PlanckWalk> It's very limited
[04:59:50] <PlanckWalk> In C even a million depth recursion will probably fail.
[05:00:02] <euphrates[m]> Ah, of course
[05:00:33] <oldlaptop> I don't remember the exact semantics in The Standard (TM), but in practice a C program will blow up if you recurse "too deep", and the definition of "too deep" varies from system to system (I, again, don't know offhand what the formal definition of "too deep" is - that is, how deep you're "allowed" to go before The Standard won't make any promises anymore)
[05:00:36] <PlanckWalk> So you have to implement in terms of iteration instead
[05:00:51] <PlanckWalk> I.e. usually in terms of mutable values
[05:00:59] <jeaye> Recursion in C will stack overflow way before 1M calls.
[05:01:48] <jeaye> C doesn't have standardized TCO.
[05:02:03] <oldlaptop> you *could* squint at a bunch of functions that use mutable state internally and say that the aggregate is "functional" if they all appear to behave as functions from the outside (i.e. map each input to one and only one output)
[05:02:44] <euphrates[m]> TCO was going to be my next question
[05:02:50] <euphrates[m]> thanks for that
[05:05:02] <euphrates[m]> i bet it is viable to program purely functional in python
[05:05:42] <jeaye> Python makes it difficult, since Guido hates FP.

[05:08:11] <jeaye> I wasn't at the keyboard earlier, but that doesn't make sense unless you either view the program itself as functional or change the definition of "purely functional".

[05:11:41] <euphrates[m]> as i understand it from wikipedia, being purely functional is being stateless, which would imply only mutable variables that your function operates on has to be passed. please correct me
[05:11:56] <jeaye> This is a great quote from that page, which says the same as I just said above:
[05:11:59] <jeaye> "A purely functional language is a language which only admits purely functional programming. Purely functional programs can however be written in languages which are not purely functional."
[05:12:39] <jeaye> euphrates[m]: Passing in a mutable variable to a fn is not stateless. Having mutable variable is stateful.
[05:13:26] <euphrates[m]> you are right, i used the wrong words there.
[05:13:53] <apotheon> It is possible to write a purely functional program in a language that is not purely functional, but that doesn't necessarily mean that *any* arbitrary purely functional program you've written in a purely functional language can be written the same way in your not-purely-functional language.

[05:15:52] <euphrates[m]> great. with the above asid, as far as i can see, a function written in procedural paradigm can also satisfy requirements of being purely functional, can it not?
[05:16:26] <jeaye> euphrates[m]: I think the easiest way to think about this is starting at the function level. After all, functional programming is built entirely around functions (not procedures) and data. So, take every single function in your code and ask: is it pure? How do you know if it's pure? This way: if you call it with the same input, does it _always_ produce the same result? If all of your
[05:16:28] <jeaye> functions are pure, the code is purely functional.
[05:16:32] <arahael> This discussion is mixing several concepts.  There's a distinction between whether a function is "functional", and whether's a function's implementation, in a programming language, is in a 'functional style'.
[05:16:37] <PlanckWalk> Sure.  "return 1;" is a pure function.
[05:16:43] <jeaye> ^
[05:17:46] *** yin is now known as onion
[05:17:46] <apotheon> Every pure function needs output to be anything more than a waste of time.
[05:17:48] <xsperry> you can write a function that is pure from the caller's POV in an imperative way, using local mutation, if that is what you're asking
[05:18:10] <euphrates[m]> yes, that is a much better wording of what i meant

[05:18:28] <jeaye> euphrates[m]: Right. Clojure has this in the form of transients, for example.
[05:18:56] <jeaye> Clojure's data structures are persistent, but sometimes you want to mutate one in a hot loop, while building it up, and then turn it into a persistent value before returning it.

[07:30:07] <arahael> So yeah, they made unicode the default, and since everybody knows unicode uses 2 bytes per character, they made char take 2 bytes instead of fpc's far saner approach, where they just used UTF-8 instead. (But then again, Delphi's mainly a windows thing, and there, UTF-16 is typical)

[07:49:51] <arahael> InPhase: We've been _stuck_ in our apartment for months, under lockdown. It's lifted, so we finally managed to get out to the place we booked at teh start of the lockdown. It's pricey, but the entire vacation's plan is: "Do nothing.  Eat at all the eating places.  Rest."
[07:50:07] <arahael> So by that measure, she's doing very well, with one excemption: She's slept right through lunch.
[07:50:26] <InPhase> arahael: Oh, well I definitely wake up for lunch on vacation.

[08:08:12] <vdamewood> Man... technical limitations really made some things brain dead back in the 90s.
[08:09:19] <vdamewood> For example, You can't install Windows NT 4.0 on a drive bigger than 4 GB, because of the limitations of FAT16, even if you opt to format the installation location as NTFS.
[08:11:45] <kveroneau> Yeah, I know.  I came aross that limitation on NT 3.x and 4.0 too.  It's like NTFS back then was also limited to 4GB or something.
[08:12:39] <kveroneau> But with Windows 98, as long as you use fdisk from a Windows 98 boot disc, you can format the drive with FAT32 and use large drive extensions I think they called it to install on a partition larger than 2GB.
[08:12:43] <vdamewood> NT 4.0 handles a 7.84 GB partition just fine.

[08:14:37] <vdamewood> NTFS itself is limited to 16 TB, even back then. The real limitations are that when you install Windows NT, it installs to a FAT16 partition, then converts it to NTFS, and hardware limitations with drives that have more than 1024 cylinders.

[16:29:16] <pikapika> it was what actually forced me to try the linux
[16:29:53] <pikapika> theres something about win 10 and disk usage that I just couldn't solve
[16:30:19] <Belxjander> pikapika: I ran into that with regards a laptop with a 32GB SSD as its only storage...
[16:30:45] <Belxjander> the SSD actually needs to be replaced and Windows needs to be re-installed on something actually larger for it to be usable or even upgradable
[16:31:06] <psydroid> those laptops were a total joke when used with Windows
[16:31:19] <Belxjander> Windows is *constantly* bitching about no free disk space... and it barely left 1GB as usable after a *clean* installation !
[16:31:44] <Belxjander> psydroid: yeah... I replaced it with a decently built desktop for my wife...
[16:31:48] <pikapika> Belxjander, I was referring to io rather than to space
[16:31:58] <psydroid> with 4-8 GB of RAM and 64-128 GB of SSD storage it would at least be usable
[16:32:01] <Belxjander> actually thinking about asking to re-install it with a Linux install instead
[16:32:12] <pikapika> it almost always had 100% disk io
[16:32:27] <Belxjander> psydroid: it has the memory and other hardware... but not the storage after installation to be usable
[16:33:48] <psydroid> Belxjander: I don't think there is an excuse for not using removable SSD storage in 2021. Machines like your wife's were sold as throwaway appliances, so you would have to buy a new one later
[16:34:09] <psydroid> I think that's just an abusive vendor/buyer relationship
[16:35:15] <psydroid> I think â‚¬/$200 is still quite a bit of money to spend on some throwaway computer

[19:30:02] <tane> I think it's fine for java development, goland is also nice, I hear rider is good too :)
[19:31:02] <bomb> code completion makes people think less about the code
[19:31:40] <tane> that's a pro argument, right?
[19:32:36] <bomb> I have just seen people can't write down code without syntax error (sometimes forgetting important classes) because they're so used to autocompletion
[19:32:55] <Rounin> It also makes it easy to spray additional layers of classes, beans and frameworks everywhere, which makes your code more valuable, since it's got more mass

But where do I actually host that stuff in my self hosted setup...? I've been looking at
[20:11:30] <Jck_true> minio for an S3 compatible server, I've looked at JFrog Artifactory and Nexus3. But neither seems to to really be what I want.

[23:21:10] <InPhase> pyzozord: I'm a very visual person by nature, so I wouldn't want to lose that interfacing ability.  But by this point in my programming career I can hold pretty large chunks of code in my head for days or weeks, and rummage through it looking for bugs or solutions while I'm not even at the computer.
[23:21:51] <pyzozord> InPhase: an AI could help deciding on what to describe around the focus area I suppose. I think this area seem to be ripe for great improvements right now. I bet there are probably projects like that already
[23:22:36] <pyzozord> I can't keep in mind more than few lins of code, I'd need to have it re-read to me every time I "look" at it
[23:23:05] <beaky> i guess dos in the early days lacked sophisticated powertools of programming like emacs or borland turbo pascal
[23:23:13] <beaky> but they had basic
[23:23:29] <InPhase> pyzozord: One thing I do a lot now is skim over a few pages of code for a minute or two, then I go get a shower and drive into work over the following hour and work out the solution to the problem I was having.
[23:23:36] <beaky> basic is all you really need to program rite
[23:24:03] <InPhase> pyzozord: It gives me something to do during this "downtime".  :)
[23:24:34] <beaky> shower-oriented programming
[23:24:44] <pyzozord> InPhase: yeah I suppose one could program in some skimming features, like reading out the function name, number of parameters and number of interesting features in the function body, like 5 declarations, 3 conditions, 1 loop etc
[23:24:57] <beaky> tho i only shower once a week so i dont make good use of such a powerful programming paradigm
[23:25:08] <InPhase> pyzozord: I would estimate it took 20 years for that to kick in for me the way I do it now.
[23:26:26] <InPhase> And at 30 years it worked better than at 20 years, over much longer stretches of code.
[23:26:47] <pyzozord> I'm about 10-15 years in now, depending how you count, but I am generally leaning a lot on my "system 1" (intuitive thinking)

[23:33:15] <pyzozord> lisp is the ultimate metalanguage, no?
[23:33:29] <beaky> but does lisp have dependent types
[23:33:39] <InPhase> user51: Generally they go the other way and make the meta languages very small, at which point everybody ends up customizing it a different way, and it becomes harder to understand different pieces of code when you drop into the middle.
