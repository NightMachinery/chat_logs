[00:00:12] <leftyfb> kodiakf: you coulddo the same with ubuntu (ansible), you would just have to craft the playbook for each package downgrade

[00:00:42] <kodiakf> so on those odd occasions where our infra would have a problematic environmental issue with a given patch, we'd just downgrade quite simply: (https://access.redhat.com/solutions/64069)
[00:01:03] <sarnold> kodiakf: fwiw we mostly prepare updates with that in mind, we've got the unattended-upgrades pacakge installed by default, which means tens of millions of machines get security updates installed overnight

[00:01:34] <kodiakf> I thought I might be seeing my first poison patches this week with the most recent Ubuntu 20.04 SSSD packages but when I went to do my first rollback I discovered that I couldn't even roll back to the last set of SSSD packages

[00:02:48] <kodiakf> ha that's the crux of the question at hand - hard to roll back to verify it was the packages and not something environmental!

[00:04:39] <kodiakf> the vmware snapshots aren't automated and I hate hate hate dealing with vcenter api
[00:05:12] <kodiakf> so in just trying to roll back a single package from this morning's automated upgrades, total fail:  E: Version '2.2.3-3ubuntu0.4' for 'sssd-common' was not found
[00:05:16] <kodiakf> it's like it's already gone
[00:05:17] <gordonjcp> leftyfb: which is the only sane way to do it these days
[00:05:38] <sarnold> kodiakf: dang
[00:05:42] <gordonjcp> kodiakf: potentially you could build the package yourself
[00:05:48] <sarnold> kodiakf: head to the package's source pacakge page on launchpad https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/sssd
[00:06:00] <sarnold> kodiakf: hit the 'full publishing history' link on the right sidebar near the top
[00:06:18] <kodiakf> so even if we had a faint suspicion on the Red Hat side of the house that we had a bad patch on our hands - we were one rock solid command away from a rollback - and it always worked.  Wild to me that APT doesn't have something similar
[00:06:20] <leftyfb> kodiakf: 2.2.3-3ubuntu0.1 is available
[00:06:30] <sarnold> kodiakf: find the version you need, find the architecture you need, there's links to all the binary packages
[00:06:52] <kodiakf> Thanks guys - I have def picked around launchpad before but that seems like craziness
[00:07:11] <sarnold> yeah I wish they left the old versions of packages on the mirrors a bit longer

[00:09:26] <kodiakf> anywho - we are also site licensed for Landscape and I think this will solve some of the package vanishing problems when we set up on-prem Landscape but the product overall is still really primitive
[00:09:46] <kodiakf> IMO the problem is more with apt itself, not having better rollback capabilities

[01:57:36] <koala_man> I've wanted to, but "set -e has a bunch of pitfalls" is not very practical advice
[01:58:13] <gdb> set -e is useful if you don't want to do any error handling yourself and "bail on fail" is what you're interested in. Otherwise it's best to do your own error handling.
[01:58:41] <koala_man> if it reliably bailed on fail, it would be much more useful
[01:58:41] <leftyfb> except when you might need to cleanup/undo changes on failure
[01:58:49] <geirha> the problem is that set -e doesn't do that in all cases
[01:59:20] <gdb> Yeah, hence "bail on fail" you're not handling any errors. You're saying "something went wrong, die." So cleanup won't happen.

[02:00:13] <geirha> I mean when it goes the other way. When a failing command is ignored by set -e
[02:00:20] <koala_man> "bail on fail, or maybe continue on fail, or maybe bail on success"
[02:00:43] <gdb> geirha: I've not seen that, but I don't use -e often enough to run into it. ;-)
[02:01:25] <geirha> gdb: A couple of examples here: http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashPitfalls#pf60
[02:03:01] <gdb> And the #1 reason, right there: "It's not actually possible for the shell to detect errors. All it has to go on is a command's exit status. When commands fail, they normally return a non-zero exit status, but many commands also use the exit status to convey a true/false value"
[02:03:43] <geirha> the next two are more sinister

[02:13:29] <gdb> If you want to do a clean install of a newer version of Ubuntu without erasing existing user data, then that user data must already exist on a seperate volume. Meaning you must have /home on its own partition or logical volume. Otherwise you will need to backup that data to other media, perform your installation, and then restore the data to the newly installed operating system.

[02:20:18] <oerheks> = buy storage space

[02:20:36] <Mat1010> is a storage block on the same hard drive?

[02:21:48] <gdb> Mat1010: No, EC2 would be another example of cloud storage. None of these options are local storage. You suggested you do not have any external disks to use so all of these are over the Internet.

[18:47:55] <tomreyn> this system does seem to try to write to sda, though

[21:13:41] <alram> Hi there! I'm having a bit of an issue on my RPi4B after the latest apt updates (21.04/aarch64). On reboot, my EEPROM seems to be reverting back to an older version from this year and hence I get bounced from my SSD to the rainbow of death-screen
[21:14:17] *** Quits: Ricardus (~rich@cpe-69-207-102-146.rochester.res.rr.com) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[21:15:06] <alram> I'm wondering was there a method to manually overwrite the EEPROM binaries somehow, because the only time I've seen that behavior has been exactly in scenarios where the EEPROM isn't up to date/matching up and hence that rainbow screen ensues
[21:15:50] <alram> I've tried rsyncing the boot-partition as well as the /boot/ directory tree from a working install of the same type but to no avail
[21:16:33] <alram> Noticed this like just now, I only have the official repositories, canonical's selections and 'hirsute-proposed' enabled afair

[21:17:29] <alram> The pi4 boots just fine into rpios from an ssd, I've flash-updated the EEPROM from over there, but it just keeps on reverting whenever I boot to the Ubuntu :(
[21:19:44] <alram> (I find it likely that the EEPROM is the culprit since the ROD [=rainbow of death] screen comes right after the Pi4 finds the FAT partition and starts to boot from it, like within a second)
[21:20:56] <alram> (AND due to the fact that when I boot to the RPiOS side of things, the EEPROM has been re-flashed into an older one...)

[22:14:27] <spjb> Very odd. Probably not a power issue then.

[22:57:02] <guestalzgh> Thanks
[22:57:10] <alram> btw one question regarding just linux and OBS in general, my webcam seems to be dropping on and off in 21.04 on an amd64 (I've read that it has something to do with the USB lane packet handling; others have been nagging about the same thing) -- do you know if there's a way to force a certain USB webcam source to always be the same exact one; OBS keeps on reverting to whatever /dev/videoX name the camera
[22:57:16] <alram> gets assigned and drops the ball :<
[22:58:55] <coconut> dman777, you would have to install some xserver-xorg packages, although i how no idea which though.
[22:58:58] <alram> (or; if it's possible to do it on the Linux's side of things and always make a certain USB device ID-camera go to a pre-assigned /dev/videoX , where X is the number of the camera ... or whatever would be a possible workaround (I found some related to this but they don't work in modern OBS's anymore...)
