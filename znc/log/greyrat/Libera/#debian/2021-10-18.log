[00:18:39] <ianjw> Hello, anyone have any suggestions for an alternative to sending email from a server for sysadmin stuff?  For things like unattended upgrade reports, log reports, and other status reports?
[00:19:29] <Blondie101010> centralized logs
[00:19:43] <PerfDave> remote logging is one thing, for things that log that way.
[00:20:23] <Blondie101010> brachamh:  can you `ping localhost`?
[00:20:43] <brachamh> yes it responds
[00:21:10] <Blondie101010> hmmm
[00:21:24] <ianjw> I guess I want something I can log into and check the status of various things.  Maybe I'll have 2-3 servers.  And maybe that service would email when something was broken but I wouldn't be spamming myself.  I used something a long time ago but it was just for embedding in a python server to get those logs only, not the rest of the system.
[00:21:42] <PerfDave> ianjw: OOI what's your objection to email?
[00:22:46] <ianjw> PerfDave, I always have trouble getting it to work and then it always breaks.  I usually try to use a google apps account to send and receive.  Seems that they made that more difficult as of late.
[00:22:57] *** pong is now known as grepittodevnull

[02:05:09] <brachamh> yeah cuz systemd is listening on 6566 apparently on ipv6
[02:05:22] <Blondie101010> you tried it in ipv4
[02:06:53] <brachamh> do you have to specify ipv6 to check an ipv6 port?
[02:07:02] <Blondie101010> yes

[02:07:50] <Blondie101010> what does that show?
[02:08:23] <brachamh> tried, connected, closed
[02:08:36] <brachamh> closed by foreign host
[02:08:56] <Blondie101010> so it reaches the listener
[02:09:01] <Blondie101010> try the same from the client

[03:25:09] <sney> udaba: right, there are a few options listed here under 'network/communications', it depends on which device your specific laptop got, looks like the hs2350 and un2430 are possibilities for EU market laptops
[03:25:50] <sney> udaba: it's hard to know without testing, but if you find out the actual modem controllers rather than HP's model number, you should be able to find out if linux driver support exists.

[17:09:15] <jelly> Debian does not really have public ftp:// mirrors any more, they're all http:// and some are https://

[20:21:07] <dob1> jkc, yes right, about password is /etc/shadow. so just adding the user and replacing the entries in /etc/shadow with the backup one
[20:21:42] <dob1> but I need to create the user with the same uid / gid or the data restored for their home will be wrong for them
[20:22:03] <jkc> It would be easier to just chown the home directory for the user as you create them.
[20:22:18] <jkc> adduser blah, chown -R blah:blah /home/blah
[20:22:33] <PMT> adduser will let you specify uid/gid if you like.
[20:23:40] <PMT> Plus making sure they're in all the additional groups they were in before.
[20:24:20] <jkc> I would say it's a far easier task to just chown the home directories as you go, meaning that uid/gid concerns are skipped.
[20:24:52] <jkc> dob1: And a better method for transferring the users' passwords is to use the chpasswd command.
[20:24:55] <PMT> Sort of? That doesn't save you if there are any other group memberships required, for example.

[20:27:30] *** Joins: totenkoph (~scythe@user/totenkoph)
[20:27:34] <jkc> For group memberships, you'd also need to copy the relevant details from /etc/group, and then you'd have to make sure those gids are consistent, then add users to those groups, etc.
[20:27:44] <PMT> Yes.
[20:28:11] <jkc> But that didn't seem to be part of the original concern.
[20:29:22] <PMT> Perhaps I'm reading it wrong, but I would assume that a user with no additional group memberships being restored would not be especially useful here.
