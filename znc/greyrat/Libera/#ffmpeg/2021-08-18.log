[00:48:55] <mago> Hello..
[00:49:30] <mago> What are -strict -2 options for ffmpeg.. ? Cant find them in the docs but they were suggested as option/flags for a command in the forums..
[00:50:08] <furq> mago: https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-codecs.html#Codec-Options
[00:50:10] <furq> it's listed in there
[00:50:43] <furq> -strict -2 is needed if you're using some experimental feature, so if you found it on forums you probably don't need it because the feature isn't experimental any more
[00:51:36] <mago> Its just for compression through in out standard command..
[00:52:03] <mago> Mp4 video compression just using ffmpeg in and out..
[00:52:04] <mago> ffmpeg -i file1.mp4 -strict -2 file2.mp4
[00:52:18] <mago> I found something on strict, what does the -2 do?
[00:52:25] <furq> enables experimental features
[00:52:33] <furq> you needed it years ago to use the builtin aac encoder
[00:52:46] <furq> that's not been marked experimental since 3.0 though
[00:55:03] <mago> Also.. Is there a gpu option for ffmpeg¬ø
[00:55:52] <mago> Like a flag that is -gpu and the encoding/decoding is done in the gpu faster? Is there such thing?

[01:56:28] <nemo> Hey folks.  I was playing around with hpj's super nifty "chafa" patch https://github.com/hpjansson/FFmpeg/commit/3a28904d13f8fe10c20a35c5a901ada189c06e86  (only required a few modest tweaks to work against latest ffmpeg)
[01:56:48] <nemo> which is nice, finally means that on remote server I can load any graphical content and get a rough idea of what the heck it is
[01:56:53] <nemo> before I could just do images and gifs
[01:57:03] <nemo> what puzzles me is ffplay üòÉ
[01:57:30] <nemo> ~/hg/FFmpeg/ffmpeg -i duckhat.mp4 -c:v rawvideo -pix_fmt rgba -symbols all -f chafa null
[01:57:35] <nemo> this works. I can play a pretty video
[01:58:12] <nemo> what I can't figure out is how to do the same with the slightly more player-ish ffplay
[01:58:57] <nemo> ~/hg/FFmpeg/ffplay -h muxer=chafa   confirms... Muxer chafa [chafa (color Unicode art) output device]: chafa_outdev AVOptions: -output_size    etc
[01:59:05] <nemo> but... how do I tell ffplay to *use* chafa as a muxer?
[01:59:10] <nemo> the man page was less than clear
[02:00:02] <nemo> eh. let's see if RTFS offers any clues
[02:00:12] <nemo> ( -h didn't really help either )
[02:00:15] <mago> How do you know the minimum bitrate to compress mp3 i did -b:v 300K and what i get is artsy but not really watchable for business..?
[02:00:36] <JEEB> nemo: I'm not sure ffplay can utilize random AVDevices as outputs
[02:01:17] <JEEB> that's kind of why doing actual video rendering in an avdevice is not a Good Idea if you expect it to be utilized for video rendering
[02:01:50] <nemo> JEEB: huh... 'k.  not a huge deal I guess. mostly just wanted basic ability to use ‚Üê and ‚Üí to skip around a quick file
[02:02:02] <nemo> guess I'll just have to figure out how to do that with ffmpeg ‚ò∫
[02:02:25] <JEEB> if it was a video filter you'd be able to utilize it with ffplay I think, unless it's not something that actually outputs a video
[02:02:40] <JEEB> like, if it's like TCT and outputs into a raw terminal or so
[02:02:40] <nemo> JEEB: naw. was just looking to do nicer video on a terminal
[02:02:46] <JEEB> right
[02:02:53] <nemo> chafa is 'sactly same as caca. but better rendering
[02:03:09] <JEEB> I think mpv had someone recently implement TCT
[02:03:10] <nemo> hpj's patch up there worked with only some very minor changes ‚ò∫
[02:03:35] <nemo> Enter command: <target>|all <time>|-1 <command>[ <argument>]  (this is what happens if you hit ‚Üí in a video with ffmpeg)
[02:03:41] <nemo> I assume I'm expected to type something in ‚ò∫
[02:03:43] <JEEB> well yes, it's not a player
[02:03:47] <nemo> yeah ‚òπ
[02:03:57] <nemo> hm. maybe I can tell mpv to use my modified ffmpeg...
[02:04:19] <JEEB> https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/blob/master/video/out/vo_tct.c
[02:04:24] <JEEB> check if this is applicable to you
[02:04:52] <nemo> JEEB: I guess I'd have to modify hpj's chafa to match their stuff
[02:04:56] <nemo> shouldn't be that hard I guess
[02:05:17] <nemo> just need to see how they hook "TCT" into the general player
[02:06:47] <JEEB> tct is apparently another "better than caca" kind of thing
[02:08:25] <JEEB> but if you specifically want it in ffplay then you'd have to implement it there as an alternative video output to the SDL surface that's being used atm :P
[02:14:21] <nemo> I'm not particular
[02:15:06] <nemo> just want it in something with at least usual advance/pause/play/backup kinda thing
[02:15:53] <nemo> JEEB: https://m8y.org/tmp/console_images/  test I made of catimg vs chafa some time ago.  I'll compare mpv's TCT to chafa's video, now that I have it working in ffmpeg

[02:17:14] <nemo> JEEB: in a small terminal window, as good a rendering as possible can be more important than performance ‚ò∫
[02:18:00] <nemo> taking a quick look at TCT's code though, it is not nearly as clever as chafa
[02:18:06] <nemo> but is probably more efficient by a wide margin
[02:18:47] <nemo> JEEB: yeah. it's far worse than chafa.
[02:19:03] <nemo> JEEB: will take a quick screenshot ‚ò∫

[18:34:38] <nemo> Does anyone know how to force ffmpeg to operate at a speed of 1x?
[18:34:59] <JEEB> -re will simulate that by sleeping
[18:35:00] <sfan5> -re
[18:35:41] <nemo> you guys were too fast. didn't finish üòÉ
[18:35:55] <nemo> but yeah. doesn't work with caca (well, chafa in this case, but same difference right)
[18:36:01] <nemo> hm
[18:36:07] <nemo> maybe I just have commandline badly setup
[18:36:09] * nemo tries again
[18:36:11] <sfan5> I don't see why it wouldn't
[18:36:37] <nemo> Option re (read input at native frame rate; equivalent to -readrate 1) cannot be applied to output url null -- you are trying to apply an input option to an output file or vice versa. Move this option before the file it belongs to.
[18:36:49] <JEEB> you are putting it after your input?
[18:36:55] <nemo>         ~/hg/FFmpeg/ffmpeg -i "$1" -re -c:v rawvideo -pix_fmt rgba -symbols all -f chafa null
[18:36:55] <JEEB> it's an input option, so goes befofe -i THING
[18:36:58] <nemo> ah
[18:37:04] * nemo fixes
[18:37:49] <nemo> speed=0.969x
[18:37:52] <nemo> perfect. thank you!

[23:18:47] <ladders> hello!  i am using ffmpeg to build timelapse video from series of webcam capture jpegs.  i postprocess the jpegs with imagemagick's convert.  this works great.  but, at night, convert is setting the jpeg colorspace to 'gray 256c' and not 'srgb'.  these files make ffmpeg complain and there are glitches in the resulting mp4.
[23:18:59] *** Joins: CruxOfTheB (~CruxOfThe@bras-base-sttrpq3809w-grc-39-70-52-52-206.dsl.bell.ca)
[23:19:50] <ladders> i can fix this by forcing srgb out in convert, but is there a way to make ffmpeg happy with those gray jpeg frames?
[23:28:49] <sfan5> and the command you are using and error message you get are?
[23:30:29] <ladders> ffmpeg -framerate 5 -pattern_type glob -i $MASK -c:v libx264 -crf 24 -filter:v minterpolate=mi_mode=blend -r 60 -y out.mp4
[23:30:45] <ladders> when it hits the gray images, it says: [swscaler @ 0x8043945a000] deprecated pixel format used, make sure you did set range correctly
[23:35:35] <sfan5> hm
[23:35:45] <sfan5> maybe the scale filter could help fix that with in_range/out_range
[23:38:09] <ladders> i'm ok with throwing out last night's data, i'm mostly curious.
