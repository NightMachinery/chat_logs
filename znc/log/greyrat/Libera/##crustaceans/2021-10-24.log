[01:00:28] <gerikson> pretty sure even Winer has given up on RSS now
[01:00:36] <gerikson> but not on outliners!
[01:00:45] <gerikson> it will be a cold day in hell before that happens!
[01:08:06] <dimadima> gerikson: well ppl on RSS ideate that shit so hard
[01:08:12] <dimadima> do you think they're full of it
[01:08:58] <dimadima> i'm not against RSS or something; i just don't have an interest in following things like that; but if i did, i think i'd use it
[01:09:23] <dimadima> like this has been top-5 on HN all day: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28967540
[01:09:23] <buttsbot> RSS is wonderful | Hacker News
[01:09:30] <moose> RSS is one thing I've never really gotten into. I subscribed to one once to see if I liked it, because I thought learning about current events would be relevant or enjoyable. Haha.
[01:10:10] <dimadima> yeah moose that's my experience more or less
[01:11:11] <moose> dimadima: Curious. Are you a consumer of other news or anything in general?
[01:11:48] <dimadima> i try to stick to tech news like hn/lobsters and try to avoid "news" like politics etc but it's unavoidable so i'm a consumer in that sense
[01:12:05] <moose> For me, I don't read news, I don't watch TV really, and I'm way more interested in hearing things word of mouth, on IRC, or perhaps through side channel sources (user submitted search trends on major engines, not trending hashtags for example)
[01:12:07] <dimadima> but i find that aggregators like hn/lobster surface more material for me than i could possibly need
[01:12:57] <dimadima> what's a user submitted search trned?
[01:12:57] <moose> Yeah. I found the same. I noticed I would be "information rich, intelligence poor" with aggregation
[01:13:54] <moose> dimadima: You can go on Google and you ever notice that it suggests some searches for you? If you don't have cookies it will tend to be generic to your assumed location based on your IP. Those are directly related to what people in your area are searching.
[01:14:17] <dimadima> nope never noticed that!
[01:14:25] <dimadima> i'll keep an eye out thanks
[01:15:01] <moose> https://imgur.com/a/aVTKqum for example
[01:15:01] <buttsbot> Imgur: The magic of the Internet
[01:15:14] <Brekkjern> I generally just follow national news and I subscribe to a couple news/politics subs on Reddit for the rest of the international stuff
[01:15:33] <moose> So basically that list there is what most people in the US are interested in right now.
[01:15:51] <dimadima> so who actaully uses RSS? are all these ppl on HN just some majorly tiny minority?
[01:16:05] <dimadima> moose: ahhh
[01:16:05] <Brekkjern> I use RSS to keep up with my YT subs
[01:16:19] <dimadima> i almost always just search from the URL bar so i never see those
[01:16:34] <moose> I think it's usually tech people aged 38-48 who are using RSS.
[01:16:44] <Brekkjern> Yup. The fossils :D
[01:16:59] <moose> But maybe it's a wider group in other countries than the US. I just notice that's the group among my friends.
[01:17:44] <moose> I am ~30 and don't use RSS nor NewsGroups and that kind of stuff. I was almost too late for the P2P file sharing craze. I have no clue how I ended up on IRC, I am an outlier probably
[01:17:58] <Brekkjern> Same
[01:18:12] <moose> I probably ended up here via the 1337 hacker scene :p
[01:19:04] <dimadima> RSS isn't usenet in my mind
[01:19:11] <dimadima> but maybe you're right lol
[01:22:51] <moose> RSS and usenet are in the same kind of like "age group" is all I was suggesting
[01:23:06] <moose> Maybe not necessarily, but the people using RSS are probably the same who would have or did use usenet/etc
[01:23:25] <dimadima> yaeh i'm not arguing i just would have thought usenet became irrelevant like 5-10 years before RSS
[01:23:32] <dimadima> did RSS every have nontech users?
[01:23:36] <dimadima> ever*
[01:23:36] <moose> Surprisingly usenet is still relevant
[01:23:42] <dimadima> really??
[01:23:50] <moose> Yeah it's alive and well.
[01:23:55] <dimadima> sure but is it relevant?
[01:24:09] <dimadima> okay let me not nit pick here
[01:24:11] <moose> Maybe we need a definition of relevant :p
[01:24:22] <dimadima> yeah i aborted that line of questioning cause it was dumb
[01:24:23] <moose> I say relevant because of my industry probably.
[01:24:36] <dimadima> who do you know uses it?
[01:24:58] <moose> I consume pretty much all of the content you can imagine and analyze it for malware and other stuff.
[01:25:16] <dimadima> on usenet or in general?
[01:25:25] <moose> On usenet specifically but also on platforms like discord and such
[01:25:57] <moose> I source for virustotal.com as a hobby
[01:25:58] <dimadima> yeah i knew the warez scene on usenet was still up and running
[01:26:16] <dimadima> if i go there will i get a virus
[01:26:27] <dimadima> oh i know this site. cool
[01:26:48] <moose> Aye. It's a neat site.
[01:26:57] <gerikson> wow, another hit for todsacerdoti, snagging that RSS link from lobsters and getting 500+ karma
[01:27:48] <moose> dimadima: RE: did RSS ever have nontech users - I think it was a mixed bag for sure. But mostly because the definition of "tech people" was different.
[01:28:18] <gerikson> RSS and blogging went hand in hand, back when blogs werhe this weird utopian thing
[01:28:23] <moose> Kinda like how 18 years ago, anyone who knew how to use a computer was a nerd. Gamer = nerd. Now you have non-tech non-nerd-declaring people who are writing Python.
[01:28:52] <moose> I laugh so much when someone on a video game calls me a nerd like it's an insult :)
[01:28:59] <dimadima> "Now you have non-tech non-nerd-declaring people who are writing Python." not something i would have thought would be true
[01:29:03] <dimadima> who are these ppl?
[01:29:22] <moose> Many US middle and high schools have programming as an elective.
[01:29:26] <dimadima> also "nerd" has been co-opted so hard by literally everybody
[01:29:33] <dimadima> how could you use that as an insult anymore
[01:29:45] <dimadima> moose: i see
[01:29:55] <moose> When I was in school, we had a programming elective thing. It was an intro class. I took it. But really it was full of nerds.
[01:30:21] <moose> Now you can be a programmer that is also a jock and it's pretty normal. There's less isolation in schools among those who do tech stuff because it's just a part of society now.
[01:30:29] <gerikson> oh hey it's that APL notation thing on HN again and a hackernews has THOUGHTS https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28971247
[01:30:29] <buttsbot> The single-letter variable names and the lack of types (beyond some duck-typing ... | Hacker News
[01:31:34] <moose> It's really common now that instead of not knowing how a computer even works, that **most** kids are coming out of high school knowing terminology like "unsigned integer" or even "pointer".
[01:31:54] <dimadima> moose: that's pretty different from my understanding. are you talking about the united states?
[01:32:02] <moose> Yes specifically the US.
[01:32:13] <moose> I'm here, so from my perspective it's what I am seeing :)
[01:33:01] <dimadima> i thought kids used phones so their tech literacy was even less than 20 years ago
[01:33:35] <moose> Every kid I know who is in school right now, elementary through college, has a chromebook or other form of laptop
[01:33:43] <moose> Along with their phone of course
[01:34:13] <dimadima> and chromebooks let you python?
[01:34:29] <moose> Probably 1 in 4 are actually learning software engineering beyond just getting a taste of it in a quick like "This is what computers are like" kind of class.
[01:34:36] <dimadima> so we're going to crush the chinese for sure then
[01:34:39] <moose> At least, among the kids I interact with
[01:34:50] <dimadima> ^ ;)
[01:35:17] <dimadima> in all seriousness this is all pretty interesting
[01:35:30] <dimadima> thanks for this low down
[01:35:31] <moose> Aye. I wonder how we will combat the inverse of the problem we have now.
[01:35:47] <dimadima> i don't know anyone who's in high school
[01:36:04] <dimadima> you mean too many average python programmers?
[01:36:13] <moose> Yeah. Average is pretty bad right now.
[01:36:32] <dimadima> they'll have to learn or do something lese
[01:36:34] <dimadima> else
[01:36:36] <moose> It's really hard to find people who know what they're doing.
[01:36:52] <moose> Not kids, but rather adults in the industry right now.
[01:36:59] <dimadima> yeah
[01:37:19] <moose> There's a lot of people out there with great skills but they're in pretty low level jobs sitting there either comfortable OR afraid to leap up OR think they don't deserve / need the higher pay.
[01:37:38] <moose> Variety of issues why people are overqualified.
[01:37:44] <Brekkjern> I think the industry is a bit too immature to actually have any definition on what it means to know what one is doing :S
[01:37:56] <moose> But in the higher tier jobs, the people cap out and are pretty much CS new grads.
[01:38:48] <moose> I mean, I feel like I know what I am doing. But I've been doing it for most of my life. I was on Freenode 18 years ago, I have been coding for a little over 20. Again, only 31 here :p
[01:38:48] <buttsbot> I’d just like to interject for a moment. What you’re referring to as Freenode, is in fact Leenode, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, Andrew Lee plus IRC. Freenode is not an IRC network unto itself, but rather another bastion of Andrew Lee’s princedom.
[01:39:06] <gerikson> dimadima: comments on Gemini:gemini://alexschroeder.ch/page/How_to_comment_without_a_browser
[01:39:09] <moose> buttsbot: Thanks. Referring to the nodes before the lee.
[01:39:14] <moose> Love that bot.
[01:39:18] <Brekkjern> :D
[01:39:37] <dimadima> well this has been super interesting
[01:39:48] <dimadima> i'm going to focus a bit more before dinner time
[01:39:51] <moose> Same
[01:39:53] <dimadima> and finish this rss nonsense
[01:39:56] <moose> I have DNS to implement
[01:39:57] <dimadima> for the 35-48 crowd
[01:40:02] <moose> haha
[01:40:07] <dimadima> thanks moose
[01:40:09] <dimadima> later
[01:40:09] <moose> Sorry if I pinned an age to you :p
[01:40:11] <moose> Later
[01:40:15] <dimadima> hahaah im 36
[01:40:27] <dimadima> just trying to find a way for everyone who wants to follow me
[01:40:35] <moose> I said 38! Well, I will adjust my spreadsheet of RSS user demographics then.
[01:40:37] <Brekkjern> But what I is that if you look at traditional engineering, engineering is "just" applied physics or chemistry. If we go by somewhat similar terms for "computer engineering", then that is just applied computer science.
[01:40:55] <Brekkjern> But even in engineering there are several different subfields that do wildly different things
[01:41:26] <dimadima> yeah Brekkjern this software thing is so nascent. i wish they wouldn't call it engineering
[01:41:39] <moose> Brekkjern: Right, like you might have a structural engineer who actually specializes in tunnels.
[01:41:42] <Brekkjern> Fluid dynamics is completely different to materials science which is entirely different to process engineering which again is completely different to mechanical engineering whcih is different to electrical engineering.
[01:41:42] <dimadima> anyway, later!
[01:42:02] <Brekkjern> Later :)
[01:42:17] <moose> Brekkjern: Ah, I see what you are getting at. The actual sub-fields yeah.
[01:42:25] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[01:42:48] <Brekkjern> Taking an engineer from one field and making them do something in another will be pointless. So much of the knowledge does not overlap
[01:42:51] <moose> A physicist may end up in environmental physics but specifically health physics which is totally different from experimental physics.
[01:42:56] <Brekkjern> Yep
[01:43:39] <Brekkjern> And the best we can do in our field is "Web dev", "devops", "ops", "embedded", "backend", "frontend", "app"
[01:43:54] <moose> I think the sub-fields I've seen in software engineering are like... web development, backend services, embedded, AI and ML, computation, cryptography and security, ...
[01:43:57] <Brekkjern> I don't think that categorization is good enough yet
[01:44:07] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[01:44:09] <moose> It's why I stay the heck away from employers who say they want a "Full stack software engineer"
[01:44:14] <Brekkjern> Hehe
[01:44:22] <moose> And it's why I stopped feeling like I was a failure if I didn't ENJOY and didn't feel skilled in frontend dev.
[01:44:42] <moose> I only suck at it because I don't put effort into learning it, primarily because it does not interest me.
[01:44:48] <Brekkjern> Yep
[01:45:07] <Brekkjern> And IMO that is evicende enough that there are different "types" of programming that doesn't really overlap at all
[01:45:12] <Brekkjern> Evidence*
[01:45:19] <moose> I am a backend developer, I like doing databases and networked services (NOT HTTP related)
[01:45:19] <Brekkjern> Maybe I should go to bed? :P
[01:45:22] *** Quits: dcz_ (~dcz@user/dcz) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[01:45:32] <moose> Haha
[01:45:48] <moose> Yeah there's so much variety in software that you can find your niche and stick in it but be forever learning
[01:45:52] <Brekkjern> Yeah. Even designing services that do TCP rather than RPC or HTTP is an entirely different beast
[01:46:03] <Brekkjern> Yeah, but that's my point
[01:46:03] <moose> Right. And even then, you have more sub-division there
[01:46:38] <Brekkjern> How do we even say a dev is competent when we can't even adequately define what category the "system" is in
[01:46:39] <moose> A lot of people make a TCP service and use a common design philosophy similar to Ethernet or UDP where they make "frame boundaries" in the stream
[01:46:53] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[01:47:06] <moose> I'm in the "forward looking finite state machine implementor" category where the entire message stream is fed into an FSM and magic happens.
[01:47:37] <moose> No need to detect and buffer stuff. It executes like a CPU executes the instruction stream and forward-looks for opportunities to prepare data.
[01:48:10] <Brekkjern> That would probably be kinda fun to do
[01:48:26] <moose> It's super fun for me. A lot of people say it's horribly and tedious.
[01:48:29] <Brekkjern> I'm a "systems developer" which is probably the most generic term for a developer that was ever made :P
[01:48:29] <moose> horrible*
[01:48:49] <moose> Haha, I was called one once.
[01:49:04] <moose> I was using C++ to build an application and they said it was a poor choice because C++ is a systems language.
[01:49:30] <moose> "When you're a systems developer, your only hammer (C++) makes everything look like a nail." was their comment or something.
[01:49:52] <moose> People are funny :)
[01:49:57] <Brekkjern> That's funny cause I've only used Python and Go in my job...
[01:51:41] <moose> Hah, lovely.
[01:51:48] <moose> Go is a sweet language, I wish I had more opportunity to play with it.
[01:51:58] <Brekkjern> I don't like it really :P
[01:52:03] <Brekkjern> And I wrote buttsbot in it...
[01:53:14] <moose> I rarely use it, but I've had good times making simple utilities with it.
[01:53:37] <Brekkjern> I don't write enough code :(
[01:53:55] <moose> Languages I use in most to least often: C#, C, Python, C++ - but by choice I'd prefer: C#, C++, C
[01:54:11] <Brekkjern> Too much ops work in integrations, meetings, architecture shit and so on. I just kinda want to write code :P
[01:54:26] <moose> I write code outside of work to satisfy my desires :)
[01:54:30] <Brekkjern> As of now my fav language is Python
[01:54:34] <moose> My deep dark deviant programmer lust, as my friend calls it.
[01:55:13] <Brekkjern> I do that too, but I'm trying to get a bachelors degree while working, so I don't have much time to code for fun

[03:29:01] <dimadima> so maybe someone w/ experience consuming RSS can tell me this
[03:29:09] <dimadima> if i have a "blog" page that lists my blog entries
[03:29:18] <dimadima> and i put an icon like this next to the "Blog" header: https://i.imgur.com/LrK42O0.png
[03:29:25] <dimadima> do i link that icon to my rss?
[03:29:36] <dimadima> or do people who consume RSS feeds rely on <link />
[03:29:56] <dimadima> i feel like i've seen those icons linked directly to RSS
[03:30:52] <dimadima> i've googled but not finding results
[03:54:07] <ngoldbaum> dimadima: sure or just stick it on /feed or whatever, people don’t really give a shit about rss anymore and it’s kinda a wild west

[05:09:25] <moose> I wonder if I type my password into Google services, if they log the attempted password somewhere.
[05:10:20] <moose> I am sure a three letter agency would probably enjoy that because of the random person who types their full disk encryption password into GMail when trying passwords after they forgot theirs.
[05:22:13] <dimadima> that's why your key passcodes should be long and unpleasasnt to type
[05:22:36] <dimadima> sletence long phrases you can't just mindlessly repeat
[05:23:03] <dimadima> it's annoying but i frequently fail unlocking keys 2-3 times
[05:23:16] <dimadima> there's no way i'd type that shit into a password box
[05:23:57] <dimadima> it would probably leak if they logged those plaintext though

[15:55:23] <gerikson> 13:45 <M6piz7wk[m]> Why is FSF not endorsing Trump? Like we are technoliberal and his politics are oriented around liberalism O.o
[15:55:35] <gerikson> keep it weird, #fsf@libera.chat
[15:56:09] <gerikson> Brekkjern: ahahahaha
[15:58:07] <ngoldbaum> trump: violates the GPL
[15:58:24] <ngoldbaum> fsf dweeb: we should pal with trump-daddy
[15:59:45] <gerikson> FSF+Matrix - not even once
[16:00:09] <gerikson> I honestly think Trump is too dumb to grok the GPL
[16:14:10] <gerikson> someone in Techrights is calling Bill Gate "Bill gAIDS"
[16:14:12] <gerikson> not sure why
[16:14:23] <riv> because he invented micro$oft
[16:19:22] <ngoldbaum> that joke was socially acceptable in the 90s, perhaps not in 2021

[18:01:08] <gwozniak> Ugh... a "fast and efficient" programming article on the front page
[18:01:21] <gwozniak> I hate that "productivity porn" nonsense
[18:06:25] <dimadima> yeah something about it
[18:07:35] <dimadima> gerikson: thanks a lot i'll definitely take you up on that. though i've tested the feed with a few readers already and it looks good. my question is people who are looking at the page should be made aware that a feed exists in the first place
[18:09:16] <dimadima> Brekkjern: woah fib indentation. woah.
[18:09:51] <dimadima> i guess that requires that you use spaces. wish there could be a tabs vs spaces argument there somehow
[18:10:39] <ngoldbaum> dimadima: linking the feed using the rss icon is very common, or just having a “rss feed” link in the footer
[18:11:43] <gerikson> remember those little blog icons?!
[18:11:48] <gerikson> wtf were they calle
[18:12:04] <dimadima> yeah they used to show up in the address bar when a <link rel="alternative"/> to a feed existed
[18:12:15] <dimadima> but i dont know if they do anymore
[18:12:26] <skyl4rk> favicon?
[18:12:26] <gerikson> no
[18:12:33] <gerikson> I think that was a FF thing
[18:12:43] <gerikson> skyl4rk: no, they were little gifs...
[18:12:53] <skyl4rk> or those mini-banners 42x16 or whatever?
[18:13:13] <dimadima> you mean this? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS#/media/File:Feed-icon.svg
[18:13:13] <buttsbot> RSS - Wikipedia
[18:13:51] <gerikson> nooo... they were short and squat
[18:13:56] <dimadima> hmmm
[18:13:58] <gerikson> can't effing remember the name...
[18:14:05] <gerikson> look this was 15 years ago
[18:14:16] <dimadima> i was a big internet user 15 years ago too
[18:14:20] <dimadima> lemme think
[18:14:30] <dimadima> anyway, supposing we know what this icon is, then...?
[18:16:59] <dimadima> Brekkjern: this thing is still killing me: "Great for mathematicians and for people who like to avoid deep indentations." lol
[18:19:32] <dimadima> heh just navigated to the personal blog of the dev who made this fibonaci vim plugin and he has an RSS icon in the top-right of his header

[18:22:22] <buttsbot> Where can I find the RSS icon in Firefox 4.0? | Firefox Support Forum | Mozilla Support
[18:22:47] <ngoldbaum> the web never changes
[18:23:07] <dimadima> i gave that repo its 256th star
[18:24:16] <dimadima> > "The simple beauty of the RSS icon was that it only showed up if there was a feed on the page. Now I have no obvious way to know."
[18:24:47] <dimadima> and of course there was a change.org petition to put the icon back
[18:28:24] <dimadima> someone should take rss and make it so that you sign up for a site and then "follow" people and then whenever they post something the site shows you what they posted

[19:24:16] <dimadima> Church: and since you use RSS-- when you visit a page, how do you find out that it has an RSS feed? is there something you look for?
[19:26:41] <Church> dimadima: tt-rss and a phone companion app
[19:27:16] <Church> I usually look for a RSS.xml or atom.xml link somewhere, or I use rss-bridge to generate a feed if they don't have one or one to my liking
[19:27:41] <dimadima> gotcha. thank you church
[19:37:28] <Church> As well as full text extraction if there isn't full text
[19:40:11] <dimadima> so it makes sense to put the full text of a post into the RSS?
[19:40:41] <dimadima> this is like the 10th time in my life i've looked at RSS vs atom and for some reason it just makes my eyes glaze over. and i kind of even like XML it's just like
[19:40:47] <dimadima> gah what's the "right" thing to do???
[19:43:20] <dimadima> and so many ppl do it "wrong": like this blog i posted above, they put the fulltext HTML into <description> without CDATA[[]]: https://advancedweb.hu/rss.xml

[20:55:08] <dimadima> pretty good pretty good
[20:55:36] <dimadima> how are you this morning imode
[20:56:12] <imode> doing alright. cold, rainy, dark days make for good thinkin'.
[20:56:45] <imode> wife and I watched totoro last night and it did us both good. ghibli movies are soul food.
[20:56:52] <riv> totoro is so nice :D
[20:58:18] * dimadima adds to list
[21:01:41] <dimadima> honestly i'm pretty stunned this post is #1 on HN this whole time and nobody except 1 other person has starred that vim fibo indent repo
[21:01:48] <dimadima> which i posted in comments, too

[21:04:13] <imode> I want that indent.
[21:04:15] <dimadima> it had 3 upvotes and then someone motherfucking voted it down
[21:04:19] <dimadima> who votes that down?!?!

[21:06:17] <imode> eh it's for rent.
[21:06:22] <dimadima> :)
[21:08:25] <imode> holy crap it's going to pour for the next two weeks.
[21:08:29] <imode> YAEY
[21:08:39] <imode> give me rain.
[21:22:20] <dimadima> do you actively dislike non-rainy weather
[21:23:05] <defect> i mean, he lives in seattle :P
[21:23:09] <defect> (right?)
[21:23:45] <imode> not in seattle but <30m away from it.
[21:23:56] <defect> ah
[21:24:06] <defect> pnw
[21:24:29] <imode> I like a mix of both. rainy weather is enjoyable because it means I don't have to have guilt about not going outside and enjoying the sunshine.
[21:24:41] <indigo> We’re getting some rain tomorrow in LA which is always a treat
[21:24:42] <imode> which is great for WFH and project work.
[21:24:48] <indigo> (as long as you don’t drive)
[21:31:16] <dimadima> if i don't go outside i end up unwell pretty quickly, so rain isn't much of a factor for me
[21:31:37] <dimadima> days when it's pouring rain all day pretty much kill me
[21:37:04] <dimadima> indigo: how many goats did you have to sacrifice for that rain
[21:40:56] <imode> mmm, hot apple streusel pie.
[21:48:43] <imode> pulseaudio why do you suck.
[21:48:58] <imode> firefox why do you leak memory.
[21:49:16] <riv> hey apparently we don't need pulse anymore?
[21:49:18] <riv> pipewire is it
[21:49:20] <riv> the new thing
[21:49:28] <riv> havent tried it yet
[21:50:16] <imode> every time I do something remotely taxing on my machine like, say, I dunno, browsing the weather in firefox, my bluetooth headset does a nosedive and lowers the bitwidth of the stream. and even then it rarely recovers.
[21:51:07] <imode> apparently it's a known bug with this chipset that the wireless card sucks so much that any traffic can affect bluetooth.
[21:52:17] <imode> which is.. awesome.
[21:52:29] <imode> but not only network traffic. any high system load does it for me.
[21:59:53] <dimadima> bummer
[22:00:08] <dimadima> 61 here right now, high will apparently be 65
[22:00:37] <dimadima> sucks that bluetooth still glitches in 2021
[22:00:50] <dimadima> most of my bluetooth shits are okay now
