[03:13:37] <manicennui> I relaunched Chrome to install an update, and it managed to stay logged in to my bank account.
[03:14:53] <Brekkjern> Why should it not?
[03:15:41] <manicennui> I assume the cookies would normally expire when the browser is closed.
[03:16:09] <Brekkjern> Not unless you've set Chrome to delete any cookies on restart
[03:17:08] <indigo> I guess it depends, firstly, on what the expiration criteria for the cookie are
[03:17:17] <manicennui> If you don't set the expiration for a cookie, it expires when the browser is closed.
[03:17:34] <indigo> Yes
[03:18:31] <manicennui> I would not trust cookie expiration for session expiration on the server side, so setting no expiration for truly session based activity makes sense.
[03:20:43] <indigo> So was it the cookie or Chrome?
[03:28:45] <manicennui> It sets like 40 cookies and about half of them are session cookies (no expiration).
[03:35:33] <manicennui> I've been in a rut this year. Can't get motivated.
[03:35:59] <indigo> I feel you. I cut out caffeine which reduced my anxiety but it was my liquid motivation ;)

[05:28:55] <manicennui> Euthanize them.
[05:31:41] <manicennui> Hopefully they charge every last person who received a fake card, and additional charges for anyone who used the card to go somewhere that required vaccination while they had covid.
[05:31:53] <manicennui> Charges for both the person and these two.
[05:32:01] <manicennui> Just lock them up forever.
[05:33:04] <manicennui> They'll probably somehow end up with community service and probation.
