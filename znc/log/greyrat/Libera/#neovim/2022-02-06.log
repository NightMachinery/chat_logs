[00:48:51] <sunjonSenghanBri> I did point you to :Telescope help_tags, right? :]
[00:49:04] <sunjonSenghanBri> `:h nvim-treesitter-highlights`
[00:51:25] <BennyPowers[m]> i searched treesitter help and ddg, couldn't find anything 🤷
[00:52:27] <sunjonSenghanBri> no problem, Telescope help_tags just is really good when using a couple of keywords, I find
[00:52:43] <sunjonSenghanBri> you can check a few possible results for validity, via the preview
[00:54:03] <BennyPowers[m]> thanks. I'm tinkering with porting over my atom theme to nvim/treesitter via lush (thanks clason for the tip)
[00:54:03] <BennyPowers[m]> When I find a situation where atom has a syntax class for a particular token but nvim-treesitter doesn't have a specific-enough hl group for that token, what's the done thing? open an issue? is there a tracker for adding hl groups?
[00:54:20] *** Joins: ublx (~ublx@user/ublx)
[00:54:44] <sunjonSenghanBri> find the home of the particular parser
[00:54:48] <BennyPowers[m]> * hl groups? do i define a custom query?
[00:55:15] <sunjonSenghanBri> everything that's defined in their queries, should have a matching hl group
[00:55:53] <sunjonSenghanBri> I've not looked in detail, but I don't _think_ different match groups map to different colors;

[00:56:30] <BennyPowers[m]> atom left, nvim right. both definitely using treesitter
[00:56:38] <sunjonSenghanBri> if they do/did, it's just be a case of creating a custom hl group, rather than it's association with a default hl-group
[00:57:04] <sunjonSenghanBri> have you used TSPlayground yet?
[00:57:14] <BennyPowers[m]> so, e.g. I couldn't find an HL group for `export` that was distinct from `declare` or `class`
[00:57:39] <sunjonSenghanBri> I'd start there.
[00:57:43] <BennyPowers[m]> sunjonSenghanBri: have it installed but haven't learned to use it yet
[00:58:13] <BennyPowers[m]> also, don't google for `tsplayground`

[01:00:28] <sunjonSenghanBri> heh
[01:00:49] <BennyPowers[m]> ok thanks for the tips that's helpful
[01:03:43] <BennyPowers[m]> how do i turn a ts query into a custom hl group?
[01:03:43] <BennyPowers[m]> like how do i select for the `export` keyword in the `export_statement` ?
[01:04:04] <clason[m]> Yeah, make sure to read the documentation first.
[01:04:35] <clason[m]> Tree-sitter is cool bit definitely advanced usage
[01:04:53] <clason[m]> s/bit/but/
[01:05:01] <BennyPowers[m]> i miss css :/

[01:07:03] <clason[m]> And although the underlying technology is the same, the syntax highlighting is very different.
[01:07:26] <clason[m]> So Atom is not a good baseline for expectations.
[01:07:32] <BennyPowers[m]> is there a concept here of nested highlight groups?
[01:07:40] <clason[m]> No
[01:07:48] <clason[m]> That makes no sense
[01:08:08] <clason[m]> Highlight groups are different from syntax groups
[01:09:34] <clason[m]> Tree-sitter replaces syntax groups, but the highlight group mechanism is still exactly the same.
[01:09:58] <BennyPowers[m]> <sunjonSenghanBri> "everything that's defined in..." <- help me understand this. I'm seeing that tree-sitter definitely knows that this is a method signature in an exported class declaration
[01:09:58] <BennyPowers[m]> but having looked over the list of HL groups, there's nothing corresponding, and using `TSHighlightCapturesUnderCursor` just returns `TSProperty`

[01:10:21] <clason[m]> Yes
[01:10:45] <BennyPowers[m]> so do i need to define my own highlight group for each nested case?
[01:10:49] <clason[m]> There are several translation steps, and all of them are lossy
[01:10:54] <BennyPowers[m]> and hook it up to a ts query?
[01:11:11] <clason[m]> Tree-sitter is early access for a reason
[01:11:41] <BennyPowers[m]> that makes sense to me, thanks. so is there a cowpath for getting involved?
[01:11:55] <clason[m]> This is an essay's worth of questions.
[01:12:16] <clason[m]> Cowpath, but no king's roads
[01:12:54] <clason[m]> I'd skim through the nvim-treesitter readme and the tree-sitter manual
[01:13:00] <clason[m]> Especially using parsers
[01:13:16] <clason[m]> That should give you a rough framework
[01:13:32] <clason[m]> Then we can discuss at #nvim-treesitter:matrix.org

[09:15:31] <yenaras> hey guys, I have my neovim config set up in modulized lua, and call each module from my main init.  I'm not really sure how to implement autocmd with an lua setup, but I am trying to set up https://github.com/ojroques/vim-oscyank and I don't know how to call autocmd to always copy content to clipboard as explained here https://github.com/ojroques/vim-oscyank#copying-from-a-register.  Should I just
[09:15:33] <yenaras> make an init.vim module and call it in my lua file or is there a way to implement this in lua?
[09:22:37] <sunjonSenghanBri> yenaras:libera.chat: wrap it in a `vim.cmd([[ ... ]])` block. There's no lua API for autocommands yet (https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/4521)

[12:51:13] <nova> can a luafile not have a space in the name? it simplifies my life .. just curious. honestly, pcall(require, ..) returns a terrible error messages. I can't exactly parse out the file and line number easily if a file can have spaces
[12:53:41] <nova> imagine if a file "lua/foo:2: bar:2:.lua" raises the error("foo:2: bar:2: contains an error") on line 2 .. then the second return from pcall(require, ..) (which seems to throw some crazy module error .. I suspect because it's not possible to require such a name??) would look like "foo:2: bar:2::2: foo:2: bar:2: contains an error" ... :(

[14:15:32] <nova> Ok. So, I made a module, but it's my first time ever writing lua for neovim. All it does is try to load lua files with protected call and if there are errors add them to the quickfix list. Can someone see if it's okay or if it's crap? thanks http://ix.io/3ONY/lua

[14:55:16] <nova> sliss, not sure about in lua, but with vim-flavored POSIX regex, you can match those with /[[:upper:]]/
[14:56:52] <nova> /[[:lower:][:upper:]]/ for both lower and upper, etc. Also, you can use equivalence classes; so, /[[=a=]]/ matches a, ä, etc
[14:59:31] <nova> I didn't sleep at all. I just made a crazy Yoda noise. It was pretty awesome.
[15:04:26] <sliss> trying... but isnt working => :%s:C+[\.\_[[:upper:][:lower:]]\.jpg isnt matching anything now. example "C+Ł_Mo.ke.jpg"
[15:04:56] <nova> because you used : as separator and have : in the regex classes also
[15:07:22] <nova> use :%s/C+[\.\_[[:upper:][:lower:]]\+\.jpg/replace/g for example
[15:08:08] <nova> or rather C\+ .. or something? I don't know what the first part is supposed to match ... /C+/ only matches a literal "C+" fyi
[15:08:30] <nova> C\+ matches "C", "CC", "CCC", etc
[15:09:23] <nova> oh. I see it is supposed to match C+ exactly.
[15:10:15] <nova> \_[…] is a class that also matches EOL (end-of-line). You probably wanted [[:upper:][:lower:]_] instead of \_[[:upper:][:lower:]]

[17:16:05] <kylo252[m]> any specific reason to not create `src/nvim/filepath.c`? we're missing quite a few patches from it, probably because the vim-patch script isn't able to handle tree-conflicts (they're pretty hard)

[19:43:30] <clason[m]> that's just extra functionality that happens not to work in this special case

[23:02:01] <sunjonSenghanBri> is there something in particular you feel has been missed?
[23:03:10] <sunjonSenghanBri> if not, "maybe don't care about" is probably part of an educated descision

[23:13:47] <clason[m]> In fact, they are likely a later version of that script that gained sentience and continues to port Vim patches out of a lingering fondness for humanity.

[23:21:09] <kylo252[m]> <sunjonSenghanBri> "is there something in particular..." <- I'll give the same example again, take a look how "behind" `modify_fname()` has gotten

[23:24:42] <sunjon[m]> Well, everything is 'behind', by nature of it being a fork
[23:25:12] <sunjon[m]> Is there something crucial you feel is being missed?
[23:25:30] <mjlbach[m]> why not port the patches and see what sean, zeert, and jan have to say

[23:39:57] <clason[m]> That.
[23:40:34] <clason[m]> The best way of improving our "behindness" is to help porting patches.

[23:57:11] <kylo252[m]> <mjlbach[m]> "why not port the patches and see..." <- already did port a similar patch that's been waiting for a review, and was told since to not bother with these "big" patches anymore 😶
[23:58:24] <clason[m]> Yes. That's what I was getting at.
[23:59:43] <kylo252[m]> <sunjon[m]> "Is there something crucial you..." <- not sure if anything is ever crucial, and that wasn't the point. I can see multiple fixes for path handling that may or may not fix something crucial, but they're more or less gated behind some of these big patches that seem no one wants to touch
[23:59:48] <mjlbach[m]> I don't understand why this conversation is more complicated than "Hey Sean Dewar you beautiful, beautiful man, I was wondering if there was a reason vim patch #my-vim-patch-here has not been ported yet, and if not, would you mind if I ported it and requested your review! Thank you <3"
