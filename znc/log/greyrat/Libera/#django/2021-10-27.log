[04:46:56] <dre> I'm trying to think, because I do want to create a general CMS/whatever site for my eco-village; I'm wondering if it'll be workable to make the "forum/" part of it, django-app based, and just sub-module that on github
[04:47:26] <dre> so I can develop the site normally, but also make the forum it's own seperate thing that could be used and improved on by others
[04:47:49] <dre> but I don't know how much of a pipe dream that is, whether it'll be messy, / not as clean to develop / etc.
[04:49:35] <dre> should I perhaps just work on my site first, and then further down the line, after a number of years, make it it's own app

[04:58:16] <dang`r`us> making something a separate app down the line is a good idea, though not always painless in terms of migrations
[04:58:24] <dang`r`us> but django could definitely use a good forum software
[04:58:27] <dang`r`us> so go go go :)
[04:59:07] <dre> ye, I'm just thinking "should i pay attention and do it properly from the /START/" because this project is still in infancy
[04:59:34] <dre> otherwise I could just hack together a shit but then cry when I try to pull the forum out later.
[04:59:55] <dre> is there a way I can make it as painless as possible?

[05:36:27] <dre> yeah
[05:37:09] <dre> that's why I'm sorta thinking; if I draw the lines at the start as "this is a seperate module" - there might be some pain while developing but would it be worth it in the long run?
[05:37:24] <dre> perhaps, I guess I won't know until I do it.
[05:50:24] <FunkyBob> so... once I can travel again, who should I visit?
[05:50:36] <FunkyBob> clearly not dre, who thinks I'm a pain in the arse... [suppository, indeed!]
[05:50:47] <dre> :D xD
[05:51:37] <FunkyBob> i have an aold plan for a cms... but it really requires mostly work on the editor / fe...
[05:51:39] <dre> wife isn't letting me do anything until 2 weeks after my second vax (I'll get the dose on 1st )
[05:52:13] <FunkyBob> my second does was at the start of August
[05:52:19] <dre> I kind of want to try that wagtail cms but it feels a little verbose, i dunno I'll have to play with it
[06:04:17] <dre> oh shit FunkyBob sorry I actually thought suppository had a secondary legitimate definition
[06:04:37] <dre> but no it was entirely a medical term
[06:04:41] <dre> my bad.
[06:06:08] <PaulWay[w]> Python question: is there a reason to do things like `self.foo_property = None` in a class `__init__` and not just set `foo_property = None` in the class itself?
[06:06:22] <PaulWay[w]> I'm not sure I understand the difference between the two.
[06:07:27] <dre> PaulWay[w], putting it in the class sets it to None for all instances of the class.
[06:07:39] <PaulWay[w]> Eh?
[06:08:07] <PaulWay[w]> So if any instance of the class sets `self.foo_property = "Not None"`, then all other instances of that class get that property?
[06:08:34] <dre> yes i believe so
[06:08:38] <dre> it's a shared property
[06:08:53] <dre> afaik i could be wrong though, chat in #python
[06:09:00] <PaulWay[w]> OK, ta.
[06:12:44] <PaulWay[w]> But the moment that's set as a property, say in the `__init__` method, it becomes an instance property?
[06:13:06] <dre> if it's set in __init__ using self.foo it will be an instance property
[06:13:28] <dre> if it's a set property in the class definition, it'll be shared across all instances
[06:13:45] <dre> AFAIK - I'm waiting on someone to correct me -- - you know what I could just try this out in the repl

[16:08:46] <Tas-sos> Hello o/
[16:09:49] <Tas-sos> I've a docker-compose file to start a container with python Django app and another one to just run some selenium tests
[16:11:53] <_Ev> Iterate over list and insert into SQLite.   form.save() only stored last string in list.  How do I force_insert=True or something?:   https://bpa.st/4CMQ
[16:12:00] <Tas-sos> but I'm not sure if my application connects to localy SQLite properly, because selenium cannot login to the app
[16:13:16] <Tas-sos> here is the django app Docker file : https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ARGOeu/docker-images/master/agora-backend/Dockerfile
[16:15:08] <Tas-sos> and here is the docker-compose file :
[16:15:08] <Tas-sos> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tas-sos/agora-sp/docker/parallel/docker-compose-cicd.yml
[16:17:30] <Tas-sos> all poplates and fixtures loaded without any problem
[16:18:14] <Tas-sos> but when I selenium tests try to login, I've login error
[16:18:20] <Tas-sos> a strange error
[16:25:39] <dang`r`us> _Ev, get_or_create https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/models/querysets/#get-or-create
[16:26:04] <dang`r`us> also you should not reassign to one object, instead always create a fresh model instance - see my link for details
[16:27:06] <dang`r`us> also if your user model is called "FooAccounts" I suggest renaming it to "FooAccount"; and the variable name "accounts_db" to "account" (or "account_model" if you *really* want but that's noise in my book)

[16:38:45] <pycode1> i mean...the strange thing is...if i am using the initial data...why does django get the data from db, i do not need it
[16:38:57] <pycode1> for a "create" view i do not have data from a db
[16:39:06] <pycode1> maybe on the "update" view yes

[18:02:50] <pycode1> guys using a formset if i override the save() should i return a list of instance of each form right ?

[18:02:58] <pycode1> ?
[18:07:00] <GinFuyou> freiza_, dunno, try different lib? I've used django-select2 but not for chained ones. Anyway it would make sense that you need to do something about form \ admin to make it work
[18:07:37] <GinFuyou> pycode1, take a look at source code of formsets... might be better to use super() first

[18:19:00] <GinFuyou> maybe, I'm not sure what you mean by that

[18:19:29] <pycode1> is that possible?

[18:26:09] <GinFuyou> What you want to get exactly?
[18:27:06] <GinFuyou> you probably want super().save(commit=True) for quote unconditionally here, but it's a detail

[18:28:09] <pycode1> when i do
[18:28:39] <pycode1> form.save() i get the Quote instance but i would like to get Quote instance and then something like quote.services.{list_saved_services}
[18:28:48] <pycode1> without query the Quote again to retrieve everything
[18:31:01] <GinFuyou> well, you have form.services ?
[18:32:16] <GinFuyou> If you wish, you could set it as quote attribute, or return a tuple instead of single var instead
