[04:54:08] <wallbroken> not right, because the implication of the statement "i'm sorry for the off topic" was "then ignore the question"

[20:02:33] <karunamon> okay, so i created a proxy model for the builtin django.contrib.auth User model that adds some extra methods.. I'm not sure what the best way is to ensure I have the same access to my new model in my templates as the builtin one. First thought was a new context processor, but wouldn't creating an instance of my proxy involve an extra database hit?
[20:03:46] <karunamon> (since, I think, I have to create the proxy using another query on the ID of the User that's already loaded)
[20:04:40] <GinFuyou> karunamon, make it you main auth user model? (or you can't for proxies? Not sure why you couldn't)
[20:09:05] <karunamon> GinFuyou: Hm. The docs made it look like that was a bit 'here be dragons'. Guess it's worth a shot. Was hoping there was a way I could just inject both models without having to hit the database a second time.
[20:09:41] <GinFuyou> But you don't really need both models, do you?
[20:11:04] <karunamon> Technically no, but that assumes any library I'm using is doing the right thing and calling into settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL instead of just blithely assuming that it's the default one.
[20:12:14] <GinFuyou> If some library doesn't it's broken by design and shouldn't be used at all
[20:12:55] <karunamon> fair enough :)
[20:13:11] <GinFuyou> Which part of docs looked alarming to you? I just see a few lines about using proxy for User
[20:13:40] <GinFuyou> I always use a custom model, but proxy should just work I believe
[20:14:21] <karunamon> When they lead with "Stop to consider if this is the right choice for your project", that was a bit worrying. All I'm doing right now is just adding a couple of convenience methods.
[20:15:25] *** Joins: Elzington (~Elzington@104.129.24.120)
[20:16:48] <karunamon> coming from a bit of rails experience here, a header like that tells me that 'The happy path is using the default, but if
[20:17:07] <karunamon> you *really* want to override the default, you have to set up a ton of your own plumbing'
[20:17:23] <karunamon> but, i'm not quite familiar with the ecosystem here yet :P
[20:19:22] <GinFuyou> Well, first I believe it refers part on using custom *concrete* model. Proxy is just wrapping the default
[20:20:09] <GinFuyou> Even for custom user model, if you base on AbstractUser (vs. AbstractBaseUser) - no, it just works.
[20:20:59] <GinFuyou> With AbstractBaseUser, yes, you'll have to do some work to fit in django processes like auth
[20:22:46] <karunamon> I gotcha. A proxy model is one level of abstraction higher than that, so it should just work at the minuscule cost of needing to check settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL instead of just saying User in your models.

[20:23:32] <karunamon> what would even be the use case for starting at AbstractBaseUser and building up from there anyways?
[20:23:34] <GinFuyou> No you always should use settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL =)
[20:23:49] <GinFuyou> or get_user_model() method, depending on context
[20:24:39] <GinFuyou> Case would be for example custom authorization backend. e.g. using email or phone number
[20:25:10] <karunamon> i.e. something that's not a 'traditional' username

[23:55:45] <swiftslayer96> Hello everyone, happy Wednesday! I am having a problem when querying a m2m relationship for one of my model instances. I have created a pastern with some code to illustrate the problem I'm having. The query is returning an empty query set when I know an object exists with that relationship.
