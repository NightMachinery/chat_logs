[21:55:11] *** ChanServ sets mode: -o companion_cube
[21:55:43] <companion_cube> lockfiles have been added relatively recently to opam, and sadly opam-repo isn't lockfile-friendly because sometimes the packages change
[21:55:45] <d_bot> <josÃ©> im honestly just beyond and completely give up on trying to create a nix library for projects relying on opam
[21:56:07] <d_bot> <josÃ©> it doesn't make sense why it wasnt even introduced on the creation of opam
[21:56:16] <d_bot> <josÃ©> nor enforced by default then
[21:56:19] <companion_cube> well back then, lockfiles weren't that popular
[21:56:29] <companion_cube> I think they were mostly a thing in ruby, maybe node.js?
[21:56:42] <d_bot> <josÃ©> oh so it didnt simply make sense at all?
[21:56:51] <d_bot> <josÃ©> it was only recently? 2019 is recent?

[22:01:05] <d_bot> <andreypopp> I personally see ocaml package ecosystem as very well designed and implemented â€” opam registry is curated, the CI runs on reverse dependencies when package version is being bumped.
[22:01:34] <d_bot> <andreypopp> There are annoynances but overall it works very well (much better than most of the ecosystems which have lockfiles) in my experience
[22:02:03] <d_bot> <josÃ©> oh really

[22:02:36] <d_bot> <josÃ©> the language i despise the most is better than this
[22:03:04] <companion_cube> @andreypopp curation is good, but it should still have immutable packages
[22:03:14] <Corbin> Gentoo's ports tree had lockfile-style hashes in the mid-2000s. Nix is over a decade old. But it's common for language-specific package managers to not properly handle the actual difficulties of package management.
[22:03:15] <companion_cube> fixing a package should involve incrementing an echo, not modifying in place
[22:03:20] <companion_cube> lockfiles are justâ€¦ good
[22:03:24] <d_bot> <andreypopp> @companion_cube yeah, that's the annoynace, this is why esy locks entire opam metadata
[22:03:36] <d_bot> <josÃ©> its something soo obvious and basic to have
[22:03:45] <companion_cube> it wasn't obvious 10 years ago
[22:04:05] <companion_cube> esp. since opam was started (at least partly) by people from the debian community (Roberto di Cosmo)
[22:04:20] <companion_cube> so, it's more about constraint solving, than lockfiles and other language-specific PM features

[22:09:28] <d_bot> <josÃ©> Opam2niz tries to solve the issue but it fialed miserably from where it stands at least from what I see
[22:10:11] <d_bot> <josÃ©> It's not the fault of the library itself but rather
[22:10:37] <d_bot> <josÃ©> It just did it wrong really
[22:10:44] <d_bot> <josÃ©> Approached it  the wrong way
[22:11:38] <d_bot> <josÃ©> a
[22:18:38] <d_bot> <josÃ©> I honestly just give at this point, it's either creating my own pm with nix or waiting months if not years for something to happen on the opam side

[22:33:30] <Corbin> josÃ©: FWIW I also gave up on that integration, and instead I hardcode whatever I need. ocamlPackages is relatively plush, so it hasn't been an issue for me personally, but I know it's irritating whenever something's missing from nixpkgs.

[23:16:22] <d_bot> <Bluddy> lockfiles are absolutely essential for dynamic languages since anything could be broken at any moment. they also end up being smart in general, but you can understand why they weren't prioritized.
[23:16:53] <d_bot> <Bluddy> similar to the way monads were only really explored once the need existed in haskell due to purity
[23:20:20] <d_bot> <Bluddy> necessity is the mother etc
