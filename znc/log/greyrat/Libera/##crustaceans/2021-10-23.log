[00:01:01] <imode> I appreciate all of the support. that 1:1 just broke me earlier. felt like my heart was going to explode out of my chest.

[00:02:44] <companion_cube> well, it's also not good to keep all that inside
[00:02:47] <companion_cube> must be a lot of pressure
[00:03:06] <gerikson> that 1:1 scheduling sounds wildly unproffesioanal to me
[00:03:18] <gerikson> not the meeting tiself, but when it was held

[00:03:58] <imode> it's at amazon.
[00:04:21] <imode> if you think that's unprofessional, I'm due for a role transition that'll bump up my base salary. I'm essentially being asked to write the promo doc myself.
[00:04:30] <imode> because my manager does not have time. and rightfully so: he doesn'.

[00:34:11] <indigo> And if I did a project with a team member I have to specifically say what I did, and what they did
[00:34:47] <imode> indigo: I have to identify what a risk I am to the company if I perform this transition.
[00:35:38] <imode> imagine being asked "how fucked are we if we give you more money for something you're already doing".
[00:35:53] <imode> because that's the criterion for the role transition. it's something I'm already doing.
[00:40:24] <indigo> Sounds like you have a good case for low risk
[00:44:26] <imode> one hopes.

[05:05:35] <imode> a "library" of code does not (should not) enable you to pick pages from a pile and glue them into a book. rather, it should allow you to pick books from a pile and use the knowledge in them to build another book.
[05:06:53] <dimadima> can you reify that statement imode
[05:07:18] <dimadima> i would certainly appreciate that
[05:07:55] <imode> micro-modules suck and caused this problem.
[05:08:59] <imode> when the idea that your program has to be decomposed to such small pieces of code that your dependency list is a mile long hasn't been laughed out of the room, we're in a bad state.
[05:09:05] <imode> hence, left-pad.
[05:09:08] <imode> and now this.
[05:11:25] <Xe> hey imode
[05:11:26] <dimadima> micro modules do suck and i won't argue about that; but i wouldn't consider the package in question a micromodule and, most importantly, that's not what caused this problem. what caused this problem is that the developer had his npm account compromised and the "hacker" uploaded a new version of the package that contained malware
[05:11:27] <Xe> i have a joke for you
[05:11:29] <Xe> are you ready?
[05:11:51] <Xe> it's supply chain security
[05:11:52] <dimadima> and what caused the problem was that npm does not require you to sign packages
[05:12:05] <dimadima> like maven central
[05:12:33] <dimadima> what happened could have happened to a macro module or any package
[05:12:54] <dimadima> micromodules are truly inane though
[05:13:14] <dimadima> Xe is that the joke
[05:13:18] <imode> that's true, very true. but the problem is that a macro module/larger package of code is sized so that its functionality doesn't exactly scream "everything needs to depend on me".
[05:13:31] <imode> with small modules, you effectively have something like multiple roots.
[05:13:42] <imode> with micromodules you have access to the dep tree of millions of packages.
[05:13:49] <imode> and can poison it.
[05:13:52] <imode> very easily.
[05:14:18] <imode> that's the real problem. if you didn't have to depend on this, it wouldn't have been poisoned so damn easily.
[05:14:20] <dimadima> yeah sure micromodules encourage inane dependency hierachies
[05:14:41] <dimadima> it boosts the surface area of attack tremendously
[05:15:07] <dimadima> but the surface area could drop to 0 if they required you to sign packages; or if it wasn't required and the incentivized by giving you a blue check if your package was signed and all the deps you use are signed
[05:15:28] <dimadima> and better still, if they did the builds themselves at NPM, cause it's 2020 man
[05:15:32] <dimadima> 20-fucking-20
[05:15:40] <dimadima> and we're running random ass code in production
[05:15:51] <imode> I'd doubt that micromodules would be encouraged _at all_ if the friction for publishing modules was raised to the point that you need to sign shit.
[05:15:54] <imode> that's kind of the point.
[05:16:04] <dimadima> all the better lol
[05:16:06] <imode> something led to this horrifying dependency tree.
[05:16:13] <imode> and it's a lack of user friction.
[05:16:21] <imode> the supply chain problem can happy anywhere.
[05:16:23] <dimadima> they should definitely add some friction there
[05:16:34] <dimadima> ppl shouldn't publish insane bullshit like leftPad
[05:16:41] <dimadima> willy nilly
[05:17:01] <imode> you also have to look at usages of this user agent parser. what was it actually being used for in most packages, to get a single field of the user agent?
[05:17:19] <dimadima> to break it down into components that are usable
[05:17:39] <dimadima> it's funny i took this module out of my backend and replaced it with a function i vendoered into my code
[05:17:44] <dimadima> erm my frontend
[05:18:11] <imode> genuinely.
[05:18:26] <imode> I'll admit that this is something you'd generally want to find in some sort of utilities library.
[05:18:33] <imode> in which case... _have it be a part of a larger utilities library_.
[05:18:55] <dimadima> that library should be built on azure by NPM or at least signed by the person who uploads it
[05:18:55] <buttsbot> 1/3rd of the worlds bandwidth is Netflix. The rest is re-downloading node_modules
[05:18:58] <dimadima> otherwise it's fucking trash
[05:19:10] <dimadima> big or small, it's trash
[05:19:17] <imode> +1.

[05:41:48] <dimadima> 2020 was, for me, just kind of surreal. i'd been hermiting for years so the lack of social contact wasn't much of change. but the whole covid and trump insanity is still kind of hard to process
[05:42:48] <imode> you want something weird.
[05:43:12] <imode> I flew out for my uncle's funeral at the end of February last year.
[05:43:25] <imode> I left work saying "Yeah, we'll have to hang out at that bar sometime."
[05:43:31] <imode> I never went back to the office.
[05:43:40] <dimadima> yeah that's fucking crazy
[05:43:43] <dimadima> that happened to my wife
[05:43:53] <imode> so I flew out, flew back, got a cold, stayed and watched the world implode.
[05:43:54] <dimadima> we left for a few weeks and then it turned out she never saw not just her office but our apartment again
[05:44:01] <imode> daaaaaaaaaaamn.
[05:44:21] <dimadima> do you still have stuff there?
[05:44:27] <imode> Iiii don't think so.
[05:44:37] <dimadima> they, uh, GCd it?
[05:44:42] <imode> probably.
[05:44:48] <dimadima> crazy
[05:44:54] <imode> again, never been back since.
[05:44:58] <dimadima> yeah
[05:45:31] <dimadima> i went back up in september to pack our apartment and move all our shit out. facetimed her a few times, it felt horrible

[05:46:23] <companion_cube> the 13th I think? hard to remember
[05:46:27] <dimadima> i wish i'd kept a journal
[05:46:32] <companion_cube> nothing was closed yet, but everything was about to
[05:46:38] <dimadima> shit was pretty real by the 13th, but not like on the 17th or 19th or something
[05:46:54] <dimadima> and then we were all back in church on easter
[05:47:06] <imode> and then more people got it and died.
[05:47:18] <imode> I haven't been in a walmart in a year and a half if not more.
[05:47:48] <dimadima> i started going to stores this summer during the post-vax pre-delta lull. even went a few times unmasked
[05:47:57] <companion_cube> looks like we arrived on the 20th of march
[05:47:58] <dimadima> imode: you don't go to stores?
[05:48:02] <imode> nope.
[05:48:08] <dimadima> the 20th was for real
[05:48:11] <imode> I walk outside my house.
[05:48:16] <imode> well, my apartment.
[05:48:17] <dimadima> how do you get food
[05:48:21] <imode> order it.
[05:48:36] <imode> grocery delivery.
[05:48:38] <dimadima> and to confirm, this is casue you're nervous about covid
[05:48:43] <imode> yyyyyyyup.
[05:48:55] <imode> that and the fact that I can't drive.
[05:48:56] <dimadima> yap
[05:49:03] <companion_cube> it was a fun month
[05:49:10] <dimadima> oh so you'd have to take transit?
[05:49:12] <imode> I'm fully vaccinated, so is my wife, so are my parents
[05:49:13] <companion_cube> moved in together on friday 20th of march
[05:49:14] <imode> .yup.
[05:49:21] <companion_cube> and realized she was pregnant the next sunday
[05:49:24] <companion_cube> 😂
[05:49:25] <imode> we're still overtly cautious because doing otherwise has bee na bad fuckin idea.
[05:49:29] <dimadima> companion_cube: wow
[05:49:33] <imode> companion_cube: ohhh congratz, wow.
[05:49:43] <companion_cube> a crazy year for sure
[05:49:58] <dimadima> my wife was due to deliver at NYU Langone hospital on april 13th
[05:50:07] <companion_cube> oh wow :/
[05:50:13] <dimadima> when milan shut down in the end of february i got really, really nervous
[05:50:18] <companion_cube> friends of ours got their baby early march
[05:50:25] <companion_cube> they had planned to isolate, they got their wish
[05:50:39] <imode> yeah I was about ready to take some time off.
[05:50:47] <dimadima> then we both got a cold, didn't know if it was covid, so we isolated for a week before moving to my parents in baltimore county and she delivered down here. switched gynos 8 months in
[05:50:48] <imode> annnnnnnd I got the infinite vacation but not really.
[05:51:14] <dimadima> companion_cube: lol same i was like " i don' twant anyone coming when it's born!"

[05:52:01] <companion_cube> sorry

[05:52:52] <companion_cube> Austin, TX, and we moved to DC
[05:53:26] <companion_cube> yeah I did
[05:53:29] <companion_cube> took us 3 days
[05:53:32] <dimadima> crazy
[05:53:37] <dimadima> the 20th
[05:53:47] <dimadima> we were down at my parents by the 5th i think
[05:54:00] <companion_cube> I was planning to move in May
[05:54:12] <companion_cube> but I moved earlier because we didn't know if there would be any travel in May
[05:54:17] <dimadima> this accelerated it?
[05:54:19] <dimadima> ah
[05:54:19] <companion_cube> yeah
[05:54:30] <dimadima> there sort of wasn't
[05:54:42] <dimadima> if you beleived covid was real, you didn't travel that month
[05:55:34] <companion_cube> yeah, stay put
[05:55:55] <dimadima> my in laws were trying to see us in new york for the st patricks day parade
[05:56:12] <dimadima> they're maga ppl but it was before the clear anti-covid maga position emerged
[05:56:26] <dimadima> they were just consuming media that ignored the existence of covid, even early on
[05:56:38] <dimadima> i was like "uhh they can come but we won't be here"
[05:56:45] <dimadima> they still haven't seen our kid
[05:56:49] <dimadima> it's all pretty terrible
[05:57:13] <companion_cube> :(
[05:57:23] <dimadima> so yeah i'm basically still stuck in 2020 :))
[05:57:29] <companion_cube> the maga mind virus is even worse
[05:57:38] <dimadima> it's horrible
[05:57:50] <companion_cube> are they vaccinated?
[05:58:03] <dimadima> nope. they tell my wife stuff like "the hopsitals are full of vaccinated ppl"
[05:58:07] <companion_cube> shit
[05:58:11] <companion_cube> r/hca all over
[05:58:16] <dimadima> (if they're no virus, why are the hosptials full of ppl?)
[05:58:41] <dimadima> but they have an answer for everything. it's a perfectly closed alternative system of thinking
[06:00:19] <dimadima> i bet they've already had covid and were asymptomatic or something. they go out of their way to expose themselves

[06:03:17] <dimadima> sure
[06:03:22] <companion_cube> and they're not young, are they?
[06:03:38] <dimadima> naa they're in their early 70s and her mom has all kinds of preexistings
[06:03:43] <dimadima> it's bad
[06:03:56] <companion_cube> :((
[06:04:02] <dimadima> but i doubt they'll die and they'll just be smug about it until they die of something else
[06:04:35] <dimadima> i hope they don't die, my wife has been through enough with all of this
[06:05:23] <dimadima> still it's hard to relish the HCA thing
[06:05:46] <dimadima> americans thought a 1/3rd pound burger was smaller than a 1/4 pound burger
[06:05:51] <companion_cube> :/
[06:06:02] <dimadima> everony is suddenly an epidemiologist
[06:06:41] <dimadima> i should add my wife's grandfather died from covid
[06:06:46] <dimadima> he was 93? 95?
[06:06:49] <dimadima> her mom's dad
[06:07:01] <companion_cube> that's quite old, yeah
[06:07:08] <dimadima> they took him to the hospital, right? but did they believe the doctors who said he had covid? no
[06:07:17] <dimadima> why take him to the hospital then? take him to a voodoo pracitioner or whatever
[06:07:24] <companion_cube> so did he have the flu, in their mind?
[06:07:28] <dimadima> he was old
[06:07:31] <dimadima> and in decline
[06:07:34] <dimadima> which is true
[06:07:42] <dimadima> but he got covid and it fucked him up and he died
[06:09:04] <dimadima> he was in decline but it was preventable cause he got it from my wife's aunt who he wasl iving with, and the aunt and her husband didn't believe in covid so they got covid
[06:09:04] <defect> my grandma was in a home where several of her neighbors died from covid. i used to call her every sunday and she was so cavalier about
[06:09:17] <defect> "oh i forgot to mention. anna next door died yesterday"
[06:10:06] <companion_cube> just another tuesday here!
[06:10:36] <defect> pretty much
[06:10:52] <dimadima> old people can get like that...
[06:10:57] <companion_cube> the worst thing is that these people think that lockdowns were useless
[06:11:07] <companion_cube> when, without them, death rate would be like 5 or 10%
[06:11:19] <companion_cube> (lockdowns, masks, etc.)
[06:11:31] <dimadima> and worse still is they now all say "look where the lockdown got us! 15 days to flatten the curve!"
[06:11:38] <dimadima> hey, guys, you didn't lock down ever
[06:11:47] <dimadima> why are you pretending like there was a lockdown
[06:12:00] <companion_cube> heh, my friends and family in France had real lockdowns
[06:12:04] <dimadima> sure
[06:12:09] <dimadima> not in the states though
[06:12:14] <dimadima> to my knowledge
[06:12:22] <dimadima> ppl were out and about, shopping in stores etc
[06:12:24] <companion_cube> no, but you have to… wear a mask to get in a store 😱
[06:12:31] <dimadima> 😱
[06:13:13] <companion_cube> I've been grocery shopping in store, though, for the
[06:13:15] <companion_cube> most part
[06:13:29] <defect> i did a couple of instacart deliveries in the beginning
[06:13:50] <defect> but then i just went to the grocery store during non-peak hours
[06:13:52] <companion_cube> more or less the same
[06:14:04] <dimadima> here too
[06:14:31] <dimadima> i went very infrequently until i was vaccinated and would drop like $400
[06:15:05] <dimadima> we lived with my parents and they did instacart a lot
[06:15:18] <dimadima> it was a strange time
[06:16:17] <defect> hehe. i did some big like $250 seamless orders a couple of times on a sunday :P and then i lived on various italian pasta courses through the weekdays
[06:16:17] <dimadima> i wish i had kept a diary
[06:16:31] <defect> not the most fiscally responsible thing, but i was lazy
[06:18:03] <defect> meal prep as a service
[06:18:08] <dimadima> :)
[06:18:15] <companion_cube> I kept a diary for a while
[06:18:24] <companion_cube> but most of days were so monotonous…
[06:18:47] <defect> i kept a list of all the crap i watched on netflix and friends
[06:18:59] <defect> a bit nostalgic looking back at it, but also sad
[06:19:04] <dimadima> initially it was surreal with the politics, and after that settled there was a lot of drama cause i lived with my parents and my newborn child
[06:19:11] <dimadima> how come sad
[06:19:32] <defect> because i had plans to learn the guitar, learn spanish, etc. during lockdown :P
[06:19:48] <dimadima> ahh
[06:20:19] <defect> instead i watched tiger king and ken burns 18 hour long baseball documentary
[06:20:45] <dimadima> hahahaha don't know about tiger king but some of those ken burns are good
[06:20:54] <dimadima> i want to finish watching the jazz one
[06:21:13] <dimadima> baseball is probably really good
[06:23:19] <defect> it was pretty good actually :P
[06:23:36] <defect> not something i'd rewatch just for fun though probably
[06:24:28] <dimadima> yeah if you try to rewatch those you realize how slow they are
[06:25:12] <dimadima> but they couldn't really be any faster i guess
[06:25:31] <dimadima> if you're into history and have a commute, i highly recommend the revolutions podcast
[06:26:42] <defect> how long are the episodes?
[06:27:36] <dimadima> 15-25 minutes?
[06:27:51] <defect> ah nice
[06:27:56] <dimadima> starts with the english civil war, and goes through the russian revolution which it's on now
[06:28:13] <dimadima> some of them are hard to get into because there are so many characters but i've enjoyed all of them
[06:28:29] <defect> if i take the subway it's ~20 minutes, so could work well
[06:34:09] <dimadima> it's one of the few podcasts i've ever gotten in to
[06:34:41] <dimadima> alright going to sleep goodnight everybody
[06:34:46] <defect> yeah, i'm haven't really listened to podcasts either. i can't multitask and listen and work at the same time for instance

[07:19:12] <imode> so I have a term-rewriting language that I'm thinking of using as my frontend..
[07:19:44] <imode> it failed as an actual language because the evaluation model was confusing (but suited towards an implementation in-silico)
[07:19:59] <imode> everything, in effect, is a macro.
[07:22:45] <imode> define (if ?condition ?body) (?condition [ ?body 0<])
[07:23:42] <imode> I could probably use this to implement the frontend _in the actual language_... hm.

[13:19:09] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[13:30:37] <imode> allo riv.
[14:14:11] <imode> up late, can't sleep.
[14:14:34] <imode> today was a mental collapse, I vented to a senior engineer.
[14:15:10] <riv> good that you could vent to someone about it
[14:15:23] <riv> can you take some holidays! might be nice temporarily
[14:15:47] <imode> I'm apparently not the only one that's been asking about medical leave.
[14:16:26] <imode> it doesn't surprise me that that's the case. but it was still a little "click" in my brain.
[14:16:46] <riv> damn
[14:18:16] <imode> I pulled up an old disk image today just for kicks and have been exploring it for about an hour now, looking over some of the stuff I used to do when I was younger, music I used to listen to.
[14:18:39] <imode> think of a time-in-place archive of yourself as you were ~11 years ago.
[14:19:22] <imode> still haven't found the first program I wrote.
[14:24:59] <imode> lots of "I wanna be a game dev eventually" vibes. I asked that same engineer about work fulfillment, and the response I got was effectively "I get paid, it's a job. I get fulfillment when people give a shit." and boy, that resonates.
[14:25:42] <imode> but it should be possible to get the same dopamine rush from the work itself at some point, right? I certainly didn't do all of the things I did when I was younger to impress someone else.
[14:32:23] <imode> I think people burn out due to a number of factors, many of which stem from excess stress, compounded onto "I hate what I'm doing". there's only so many moments you can dream about being a farmer before you start _really_ considering buying a tractor.
[14:34:16] <riv> i think you definitely can work if it's a good environment
[14:34:19] <imode> I wonder what subset of the overall programming "universe" contains the happiest people. probably somewhere between game developers and clojure devs.
[14:34:21] <riv> can enjoy work*
[14:34:38] <riv> I've heard some bad things about game development though
[14:34:52] <riv> I suppose there is a huge variance in that space
[14:35:09] <imode> yeah, and I think it sways from indie dev to industry dev.

[17:55:18] <dimadima> welcome back buttsbot
[18:05:46] <dimadima> there seem to a bunch of decent jobs on stack overflow
[18:06:16] <dimadima> you can even apply w/o doign a resume or anything
[18:06:18] <dimadima> to some
[18:30:56] <indigo> You looking for a new job Dima?
[18:54:05] <dimadima> that naval tweet btw was so dumb
[18:54:27] <dimadima> indigo: na just launching this thing you know; have to at least do a show hn :)
[18:54:55] <dimadima> but i always look and oggle the other side of steady salaries
[18:57:47] <dimadima> i would love to get some investment!
[18:58:12] <dimadima> i like my app
[18:59:05] <dimadima> thinking a show hn for real next week
[18:59:23] <dimadima> i doubt VCs want to invest in an app that openly shits on optimizing for engagment
[18:59:31] <dimadima> but who knows
[19:03:33] <indigo> dimadima: Gotta put some crypto in it, then VCs will be all over it
[19:04:05] <dimadima> do they really like that
[19:04:59] <indigo> It's the meme I guess
[19:05:10] <dimadima> yeah, i was hoping you were kidding
[19:05:13] <dimadima> but i do oggle shit like this https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/555760/frontend-engineer-typescript-react-nira
[19:05:13] <buttsbot> Frontend Engineer 🧰 Typescript | React | Experience: 5+ years | 100% Remote at Nira  - Stack Overflow
[19:05:19] <dimadima> lol
[19:05:28] <dimadima> is this job shitty in reality? probably
[19:06:30] <indigo> Who knows; decent salary at least
[19:06:35] <indigo> I wonder what the benefits are
[19:06:49] <dimadima> kind of sucks no office at all
[19:07:29] <indigo> I found this the other day: https://angel.co/company/pexeso/jobs/1698665-go-engineer-iii ; 30 days vacation is pretty sweet
[19:07:29] <buttsbot> Attention Required! | Cloudflare
[19:08:39] <dimadima> yeah thats sweet
[19:09:22] <dimadima> what is the "0.001% – 0.01%"
[19:09:29] <indigo> Equity percentage
[19:09:40] <indigo> A.k.a. monopoly money
[19:10:09] <dimadima> ah i see
[19:10:25] <dimadima> never noticed that angel.co has the same logo as hey.com, basically
[19:10:44] <dimadima> hmm no a bit different
[19:10:47] <dimadima> remembered it wrong
[19:13:02] <indigo> Similar style!
[19:16:49] <dimadima> you job searching indigo ?
[19:17:48] <indigo> Just curious what's out there :-)
[19:18:18] <indigo> This one caught my eye because I play a game with my friends called Apex Legends, shortened to Pex
[19:19:47] <dimadima> ah
[19:20:09] <dimadima> yeah it's nice to look. i get pretty anxious sometimes
[19:20:44] <dimadima> seeing that opportunities exist, at least in theory, sometimes calms me down
[19:21:30] <indigo> How much runway do you have?
[19:21:37] <dimadima> indefinite in a way
[19:21:45] <dimadima> my wife has a decent job
[19:21:57] <dimadima> butttt of course it's kind of fucked up
[19:22:03] <dimadima> so i want some solid traction by, say, the end of the year
[19:22:29] <indigo> Nice! And how long have you been working on it?
[19:22:44] <dimadima> a whillleee too long to say
[19:23:09] <dimadima> have made a lot of technical and product mistakes
[19:23:40] <dimadima> finally have what i've always wanted though product-wise, and the technical aspect is great too, i think
[19:23:49] <dimadima> only thing keeping me from a show HN is a blog post
[19:23:59] <dimadima> which i should have been working on this moring
[19:24:00] <dimadima> :)
[19:24:26] <indigo> Well, I'll make sure to give you an upvote :-)
[19:24:40] <dimadima> that would rule
[19:25:11] <dimadima> i wonder how HN weighs upvotes
[19:26:03] <indigo> I heard that if you send the post link to someone, and they upvote from the link, it triggers some sort of voting ring protection
[19:26:08] <dimadima> like if i drop a link to the post, do upvotes by ppl who came to the post directly count as much as upvotes by ppl who navigate through "New"?
[19:26:14] <dimadima> yeah
[19:26:30] <dimadima> similarly, does it count upvotes from ppl w/ more karma or more submissions or whatever?
[19:26:35] <dimadima> i mean, does it weigh them more
[19:26:39] <dimadima> anyway, who cares
[19:26:59] <dimadima> hopefully it'll just work
[19:48:29] <prussian> 11:53 < dimadima> which i should have been working on this moring
[19:48:32] <prussian> story of my life
[19:57:25] <dimadima> prussian: seriously. i did do some related stuff, like the UI around the blog, the rss feed (which is really half the purpose of the blog)
[19:57:40] <dimadima> but the blog post itself it still languishing as several different concept drafts
[19:58:05] <dimadima> RSS seems so freakin huge on HN right now
[19:58:37] <dimadima> who knows if it's actually huge or it's just techno-lifestyle ideation
[19:58:50] <dimadima> but it it's really, got to give the ppl something to subscribe to :)
[19:58:55] <dimadima> real*
[19:59:11] <prussian> ya.
[19:59:34] <prussian> I was going to write up some tutorials and crap about shell scripting to work along all the side material I am showing people at workk
[19:59:36] <prussian> but idk
[19:59:44] <prussian> you have more done than me.
[20:00:12] <prussian> clearly I need some drugs over here.
[20:06:59] <dimadima> i've never tried any of the official productivity drugs
[20:11:36] <dimadima> THC gets me nicely in the zone but its been a long time at this point
[20:12:00] <dimadima> it's just me and my brain chemistry
[20:23:30] <prussian> clearly I need adderal
[20:23:41] <prussian> or maybe that other one, ritalin
[20:24:07] <prussian> I am trying anti-depressants right now, thinking maybe it's just a depression thing keeping me lazy as fuck.
[20:24:40] <prussian> dimadima: how are you taking the THC though? I noticed like eating vs lung inhalation seem to give wildly different effects.
[20:24:45] <prussian> one less powerful than the other.
[20:28:25] <ngoldbaum> it depends
[20:29:06] <ngoldbaum> edibles need fat to bind with before you can digest the thc, so if it’s a gummy or whatever you need to eat a meal with some far first
[20:30:51] <ngoldbaum> err, some fat
[20:37:01] *** Joins: ben_ (ben@libera/staff/ben)
[20:37:36] <prussian> hmm
[20:37:43] <prussian> interesting
[20:38:08] <prussian> I guess with the legality becoming more gray than black, more studies are being done.
[20:38:14] <prussian> ngoldbaum: ty
[20:38:21] <prussian> I'm not really into vape/smoke
[20:38:34] <prussian> I'll try this next time I bother to buy extract or whatever.
[20:38:58] <ngoldbaum> if you get a cookie or brownie the thc in that is weed butter so you don’t need extra fat
[20:43:47] <prussian> hmm
[20:43:52] <prussian> o-ok
[20:43:59] <prussian> this is all very good to know.
[20:44:16] *** Quits: ben (ben@libera/staff/ben) (Ping timeout: 600 seconds)
[20:44:17] <prussian> I think the last time I had a brownie I had weird nerve sensations and spasms in my legs.
[20:44:21] <prussian> was pretty funny
[20:49:15] <riv> that doesn't sound funny but i haven
[20:49:18] <riv> 't had any brownies
[20:49:23] <gerikson> https://portal.mozz.us/gemini/gerikson.com/gemlog/rark/Re-bitcoin-chrome.gmi
[20:49:23] <buttsbot> More like buttcoin, am I rite!?
[20:49:24] <buttsbot> Gemini Portal
[20:50:05] <riv> well said
[20:50:15] <riv> is there a non gemini version of this?
[20:50:44] <dimadima> prussian: i'm not into being stoned, especially heavily stoned, so spliffs were what i enjoyed. i bet the nicotene played its part. but that is exceedingly unhealthy so no really sustainable
[20:51:01] <ngoldbaum> i used to do all my
[20:51:04] <prussian> riv: well ya. in hindsight, all stupid things are funny. especially if they don't kill you
[20:51:08] <prussian> I tell you HWAT
[20:51:14] <ngoldbaum> physics problem sets in undergrad stoned off my ass
[20:51:16] <dimadima> edibles can be pleasant but that's its whole experience
[20:51:16] <ngoldbaum> was nice
[20:51:18] <prussian> I had a mega "hangover" the day after.
[20:51:50] <prussian> dimadima: everything cool kills you.
[20:51:51] <prussian> sucks
[20:52:47] <dimadima> i fit the typical ADHD profile in many ways (although who doesn't, to some extent?) so i wonder if adderal would be good for me. anyway i've been pretty functional just plain so whatever it's fine
[20:52:55] <riv> ngoldbaum: is this how string theory was invented?
[20:52:57] <dimadima> prussian: yeah wtf is with that
[20:53:19] <ngoldbaum> dimadima: getting a diagnosis for adhd as an adult is an enormous pain in the ass
[20:53:22] <dimadima> my wife has a night cap often
[20:53:27] <ngoldbaum> especially if you have adhd :p
[20:53:37] <imode> protip for life. don't fall asleep at your computer.
[20:53:41] <ngoldbaum> even more so in europe i hear
[20:53:42] <dimadima> wish i was into alcohol but i have a strong aversion to alcohol
[20:53:49] <dimadima> morning imode
[20:53:51] <dimadima> never done that
[20:54:02] <imode> not fun.
[20:54:20] <dimadima> were you upright or head down or what
[20:54:38] <prussian> I was diagnosed as a kid at least.
[20:54:38] <prussian> lol
[20:54:41] <imode> head -> desk
[20:54:47] <prussian> adhd
[20:54:53] <imode> or rather head -> laptop.
[20:54:54] <dimadima> wow it's like you're working the 996
[20:55:07] <dimadima> or investment bank analysis straight ouf of college thing
[20:55:35] <dimadima> prussian: they tried to get me to get diagnosed but i never got it checked out
[20:55:59] <prussian> I don't really know what it means but whatever.
[20:56:09] <prussian> imode: lol
[20:56:14] <dimadima> in what sense know what it means
[20:56:15] <prussian> imode: what did you do?
[20:56:19] <prussian> did you luanch the missiles?
[20:56:20] <dimadima> the diagnosis?
[20:56:23] <dimadima> lol
[20:56:31] <prussian> dimadima: what ADHD means
[20:56:39] <imode> prussian: no but I have my mouse buttons imprinted onto a part of my forehead.
[20:56:43] <prussian> I mean I get it, but it seems like such a weird "disease"
[20:56:44] <prussian> if it is one
[20:56:45] <dimadima> touchpoint launches the missles
[20:56:50] <prussian> imode: oh lol
[20:56:56] <imode> blugh
[20:57:23] <gerikson> riv: I migh put it on HTML later
[20:57:30] <gerikson> wanna see if the dude responds
[20:57:37] <dimadima> yeah ADHD is pretty suspicous. my wife works in children's mental health though and while she readily admits it's overdiagnosed also strongly believes it's real
[20:58:10] <ngoldbaum> plenty of people abuse adderal
[20:58:41] <prussian> dimadima: I mean when I did the test, I see why they diagnosed me.
[20:58:49] <prussian> I mean even right now in life as an adult, I see it.
[20:58:59] <prussian> it just seems unsatisfying in terms of what is known about it.
[21:00:59] <imode> any psychological disorder can be induced by environmental factors, otherwise we wouldn't have PTSD. ADHD is in that same vein: you put a kid or an adult in a situation where their focus is effectively pushed against for long enough time, they'll hyperfocus on some other thing in order to keep their mind active, or not focus on anything ever again.
[21:01:20] <imode> aka our schools.
[21:01:25] <imode> and jobs.
[21:01:45] <prussian> I guess.
[21:01:59] <prussian> Hell, I don't think I did anything productive at work in literally 2 months.
[21:02:17] <prussian> thus the anti-depressant and other med trying.
[21:02:30] <imode> a fellow potential burn-out!
[21:02:36] <prussian> ig
[21:02:39] <dimadima> neil postman has an interesting socio-cultural theory of ADHD
[21:02:48] <prussian> I'm a pretty lazy fuck in general though imode
[21:02:55] <prussian> so idk if burn-out is the right word
[21:02:56] <dimadima> prussian: but yaeh it's quite nebulous and unsatisfying
[21:03:07] <dimadima> imode: so have you left your chair yet
[21:03:16] <gerikson> riv: this "Re:" format is how comments work in Gemini... sort of
[21:03:27] <dimadima> gerikson: there are comments on gemini?
[21:03:34] <prussian> the future is now...
[21:03:42] <imode> dimadima: ye
[21:03:42] <prussian> discus better watch out.
[21:03:43] <gerikson> dimadima: sometimes
[21:03:54] <dimadima> weird
[21:04:12] <prussian> wait is it discus or something else? the stupid 3rd party comment service.
[21:05:07] <dimadima> yeah discus, spelled somehow
[21:05:31] <dimadima> the provide the best comment services for bespoke media platforms like breitbart
[21:05:34] <gerikson> dimadima: I mean, there;s microblogs and RSS and so on
[21:06:01] <dimadima> i wonder what percentage of discus comment is blaming obama for something
[21:06:09] <gerikson> lol
[21:06:14] <gerikson> Disqus was ok
[21:06:26] <gerikson> it was like gmail for comments
[21:06:35] <gerikson> hosting your own comments was a fucing pain
[21:06:43] <gerikson> so much spam
[21:06:50] <dimadima> it is but have you seen the extent to which they track
[21:07:02] <dimadima> it's intense...
[21:07:04] <gerikson> gotta monetize somehow
[21:07:20] <dimadima> gotta squeeze ever faction of a penny
[21:09:08] <dimadima> sorry i'm being all communist
[21:09:26] * dimadima takes off his che t-shirt
[21:13:06] <dimadima> i worked in finance out of college and the single most remarkable thing about the experienc was that the notion of making less money just did not compute
[21:13:17] <dimadima> they would rather make no money than less money
[21:13:30] <dimadima> like maybe there was some game theory thing there
[21:13:35] <dimadima> i'd believe that, but still
[21:13:57] <dimadima> like if they were "supposed to make 5%" on a deal, they would not take "4.75%", no way
[21:14:33] <dimadima> it was like an inalienable right to collect X% for their services
[21:15:41] <imode> sad fact is that that's how you make money.
[21:15:47] <imode> and lots of it.
[21:17:56] <dimadima> yeah it's annoying these people force you to participate in their race to the bottom or fail entirely
[21:18:33] <Xe> https://twitter.com/mattcolville/status/1451450267635904513?s=21
[21:18:33] <buttsbot> Twitter - mattcolville - I love it. https://t.co/110Vvg2h1k
[21:19:48] <prussian> 13:39  * dimadima takes off his che t-shirt <- good
[21:19:54] <prussian> commies OUT
[21:21:04] <imode> Xe: reminds me of the crypto hamster but with D&D. in a campaign nobody knows you're a cat.
[21:21:28] <dimadima> prussian: i put on my wounded warrior project shirt
[21:21:37] <dimadima> prussian: most capitalist brand out there
[21:22:10] <dimadima> i know exactly nothing about DnD
[21:22:23] <prussian> this...
[21:22:24] <prussian> SO true
[21:23:17] <imode> it's basically fun roleplay with some dice rolls thrown in.
[21:23:34] <dimadima> somthing with satan worship though https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26328105
[21:23:38] <dimadima> ;)
[21:23:39] <prussian> damn.
[21:24:26] <imode> everything is satanic.
[21:24:29] <prussian> so the cat passed the check and just sat there?
[21:24:45] <prussian> maybe the cat was human after al
[21:24:53] <prussian> dimadima: ya
[21:25:03] <prussian> that's the old joke I think
[22:39:52] <dimadima> i wish there was some way to track twitter ads conversions w/o installing their "tags" on my homepage
[22:42:59] <dimadima> when a person clicks an ad and goes to your homepage, there's a `clid` in the url and if you have their tracking code installed on your site it harvests that id so you can get more insight into what works
[22:43:32] <dimadima> but i'm not trying to expose users to twitter genrally
[22:43:39] <dimadima> beyond that one interaction
[22:47:07] <dimadima> there is no prior art on github it seems
[22:48:03] <dimadima> maybe the ping-back to twitter has to happen in the browser because it also sends the user's cookies
[22:48:11] <dimadima> i mean, i'm sure it does, but that's probably necessary
[22:57:45] <dimadima> heh dave winer answers an RSS question on stack overflow https://stackoverflow.com/a/30627069/741970
[22:57:45] <buttsbot> xml - Difference between description and content:encoded tags in RSS2 - Stack Overflow
[22:57:57] <dimadima> that's too much
[23:15:29] <dimadima> love the stackoverflow cameos
