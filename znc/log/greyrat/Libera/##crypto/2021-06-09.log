[01:25:57] *** river is now known as riv
[01:27:11] <MacGyver> My point was that C doesn't actually error. You're still checking the return count and *then* checking feof/ferror.
[01:27:21] <MacGyver> So you still check for eof.
[01:27:28] <MacGyver> You just don't do so every loop iteration.
[01:34:02] <Soni> idea: E.164 certificates. it's a lot easier to get a phone number than an IP address, so it should be easy to get E.164 certificates too. and most phone numbers support SMS, which is packet-switched. this would revolutionize DoH.
[01:35:19] <danieldg> it's easier to get a phone number than an IP? News to me.
[01:36:29] <Soni> static phone number you can "prove" control of: $5/mo. static IP address you can "prove" control of: GLHF.
[01:37:00] <Soni> getting certs for IP addresses requires Expensive. getting certs for a phone number? could be done just like DV certs.
[01:37:36] <Soni> granted, you *are* billed per SMS, so the TLS handshake + whatever is required for a DV-equivalent cert could get quite expensive
[01:37:48] <Soni> but all in all it's pretty cheap
[01:37:51] <MacGyver> Soni: What do you mean, "requires expensive"?
[01:38:07] <Soni> MacGyver: you need to pay for IP certificates
[01:38:24] <MacGyver> By which you mean "Let's encrypt doesn't do them"?
[01:38:26] <Soni> just take a look at OpenNIC's DoH/DoT tier 2's
[01:38:35] <Soni> literally none of them have a valid cert
[01:38:58] <Soni> Fusl's anycast might, at some point, but Fusl's anycast don't currently support DoH/DoT
[01:39:55] *** Quits: fatal (0x00@user/fatal) (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[01:40:08] <Soni> phone numbers are, by their nature, static by default. this makes them an interesting candidate for DoH/DoT/LE purposes.
[01:40:31] <MacGyver> Except they're not plugged into the internet infrastructure at all.
[01:40:56] <MacGyver> That would be a hurdle.
[01:40:59] <Soni> they do have their own digital infrastructure, yes
[01:41:04] <danieldg> also, they act more like domain names than IPs
[01:41:07] <Soni> so you'd need a special modem for DoH/DoT purposes
[01:41:27] <MacGyver> Can we just call this DNS-over-SMS, abbreviate accordingly, and call it a day?

[01:44:57] <Soni> you can get anycast if you pay the provider tho

[01:48:17] <danieldg> that solves this problem, right?
[01:48:35] <Soni> at least it doesn't need to fit IP headers into the MTU
[01:48:53] <MacGyver> Don't modern phone networks basically run over IP anyway?
[01:49:10] <MacGyver> Or maybe that's just the backbone...

[04:00:30] <danieldg> true, that does make for more readable code
[04:06:15] <Gravis> the problem is that the gains are so minor that adding byteswaps negates them

[04:08:56] <Gravis> what does that mean?
[04:09:13] <danieldg> uint64 * uint64 produces a 128-bit integer

[04:09:44] <danieldg> in x86 asm it's in two registers, but in the compiler it's just as __uint128_t

[22:24:32] <jbis> If I buy a domain, how do I ensure that the previous owner doesn't have a valid cert for my domain?
[22:24:53] <yawkat> check certificate transparency
[22:27:13] <jbis> ?
[22:27:42] *** Joins: drathir_tor (~drathir@wireguard/tunneler/drathir)
[22:29:32] <Alipha> jbis: Certificate Transparency is a log of all certificates that have been created. all certificate authorities are supposed to log to CT whenever they create a certificate
[22:30:03] <jbis> But only a couple CAs work with them right?
[22:30:51] <yawkat> no, all do
[22:33:03] <jbis> There website lists a ocuple
[22:33:48] <Riastradh> All public HTTPS CAs have to report to CT now, I believe.
[22:34:10] <Alipha> google (and probably all the other browsers) would quickly revoke CA's root certificates if they found they weren't logging to CT
[22:34:20] *** Joins: personperson (~personper@185.192.70.71)

[22:36:06] <Peng> CAs aren't required to log certificates to CT.
[22:36:29] <Peng> For browsers to trust them, certificates have to have been logged to CT.
[22:38:35] <Peng> jbis: If it's a Let's Encrypt certificate and you contorl all hostnames, you can revoke it using an ACME client. Other ACME CAs may be the same.
[22:38:48] <Peng> jbis: In general, you can submit a problem report to the CA.
[22:38:57] <Peng> Revocation is kinda useless though.
[22:39:24] <Alipha> firefox is the only one that checks revocation and they fail open, i believe?

[22:42:42] <Wulf> jbis: it's unlikely the previous owner will be able to attack your users.
[22:42:48] <Peng> It's unlikely, but possible, that the previous domain owner has an unlogged certificate for the domain.
[22:43:32] <Peng> (Note that they could subsequently log it, serve SCTs with the TLS extension, and browsers would be cool with it, I think.)
[22:43:45] <Wulf> jbis: check on https://crt.sh/ for certs. And then make a risk assassment.

[22:45:02] <Wulf> jbis: that's one reason why certificate lifetimes have been decreased a lot
[22:45:32] <jbis> LetsEncrypt is 90 days which I used to find annoying but now like
[22:46:09] <jbis> I still like the idea of using DNS instead of CAs.
[22:46:12] <Alipha> yeah, google and such want to push that way down. like a week 
[22:46:45] <Alipha> Certs should just be in DNS records, yeah. though DNS needs to be secured first
[22:47:05] <jbis> It needs to be decentralized 
[22:47:24] <yawkat> how exactly would that work
[22:47:24] <jbis> but I think i asked about that here a couple days ago
[22:48:19] <jbis> What was that DNS protocol called again?
[22:48:29] <Peng> DANE
[22:48:32] <jbis> thanks
[22:48:56] <Alipha> There's namecoin
[22:49:14] <yawkat> .-.
[22:49:27] <jbis> yawkat Not sure
[22:50:24] <Alipha> Though since Chrome and such don't check revocation because they're concerned about page loading performance, why don't they just pre-download all new revocations each day or such?
[22:50:30] <Wulf> reminds me to setup dnssec for my domains. I started with one, but its names are enumerable which I really don't want for the others.
[22:50:52] <jbis> One idea was to use basically a blockchain. But not entirely decentralized. ICANN would still handle domain registration, but the network would have to approve everything ICANN does. Once you own it tho, ICANN doesn't handle transfers.
[22:51:18] <jbis> If you loose your public key or to prevent domain squatting network could transfer back ownership to ICANN

[22:52:08] <jbis> Adds a type of democracy to control ICANN
[22:52:20] <yawkat> O.o
[22:52:37] <jbis> So ICANN can't do whatever they want
[22:52:45] <yawkat> do you want to make a vote on every approval-requiring action or what?
[22:52:46] <Wulf> jbis: they can't anywaay
[22:53:04] <jbis> Also you then don't need CAs
[22:53:13] <jbis> which solves 100 different problems
[22:53:21] <Wulf> jbis: I've got e.g. "1e8.de". What could icann possibly do to my domain?
[22:53:37] <yawkat> jbis: why do you not need CAs?
[22:54:07] <jbis> Because you could then use DANE

[22:54:31] <yawkat> or you get an eclipse attack

[22:59:07] <MacGyver> I beg to differ.
[22:59:45] <MacGyver> Cryptocurrency is one of the few usecases where blockchains actually are a technically valid solution for the "problem" they think they should be solving.
[22:59:57] *** Quits: v4skie (~v4skie@78.164.49.235) (Quit: Leaving)
[22:59:59] <MacGyver> I disagree with that problem analysis, but on technical merits it holds up.
[23:00:41] <jbis> At the end of the day, most of the security on the internet relies on DNS and therefore relies on ICANN. I don't think ICANN is trustworthy.
[23:00:45] <riv> i disagree about blockchains
[23:00:54] <MacGyver> For virtually every other problem that people are using blockchains for, alternative solutions that are basically "on the path from a text file to a full fledged blockchain" are more sensible.
[23:01:03] <jbis> How do CAs validate domain owns? DNS
[23:01:22] <Wulf> jbis: I really don't want a blockchain for domains. Currently, if anyone manages to steal my domain, I can use the legal system to get it back. With an "uncontrolled" system, I couldn't.
[23:02:22] <Wulf> jbis: what exactly could ICANN do about my .de domain?
[23:02:46] <jbis> In the system above you could complain to ICANN and ICANN would make a request to the network and people would vote on whether they believe it should be given back to you. 
[23:03:08] <yawkat> they probably wouldnt vote though
[23:03:08] <MacGyver> But I don't want people to vote. I want a court to rule based on contract law.
[23:03:10] <Wulf> jbis: what do "people" care about my domain?
[23:03:50] <jbis> Why should US contract law govern the global internet?

[23:31:20] <jbis> thank you!
[23:32:58] <MacGyver> I also have a presentation by someone from NLNetLabs but I'm not at liberty to share that one; which goes a bit into how DoT is the superior solution in sane jurisdictions.
[23:33:05] <MacGyver> I.e. those where your ISP is not allowed to sell your data.
[23:33:22] <MacGyver> Give me a few minutes to google if there's a public version of that one.
[23:34:19] <jbis> I haven't read enough about yet to understand but Oblivious DNS doesn't fix the issue right?
[23:34:21] <MacGyver> Close enough.
[23:34:23] <MacGyver> https://www.nlnetlabs.nl/downloads/presentations/20200206-CCC-Osnabrueck-vanRijswijkDeij.pdf
[23:34:41] <MacGyver> Since that looks like CCC, might be a recording on the CCC media pages as well.
[23:35:17] <MacGyver> Oblivious DNS might actually fix the issue that Mozilla and Google are adamant they're "fixing" with DoH.
[23:35:34] <MacGyver> But I don't know enough about it to say for sure.
[23:35:35] <Peng> I don't get Oblivious DoH, it sounds like Tor but not good

[23:35:47] <MacGyver> Nor how that interacts with the bloom filters that Van Rijswijk explains.

[23:36:33] <MacGyver> Peng: Oblivious DNS AIUI is an effort to provide the same privacy-against-ISP-guarantees on top of DoT.
[23:36:45] <MacGyver> I might be outdated here though?

[23:40:53] <MacGyver> Full disclosure, I'm not exactly a disinterested party here, Roland is an ex-colleague of mine, so I am biased both in exposure and in value of opinion.
[23:45:30] <TimMc> So Oblivious DNS is basically... minimal transport security + a proxy that you vaguely trust not to collaborate with the authoritative server?
[23:46:17] <TimMc> s/collaborate/collude/
[23:47:11] <MacGyver> Well sure, but how is that different from trusting your DoH provider not to look at your queries?

[23:49:03] <Wulf> jbis: yes, DENIC could turn my domain over to someone else. But they are bound by law.
[23:49:22] <yawkat> except ODoH can run over QUIC with fewer roundtrips
[23:49:38] <ms7821> I thought ODNS basically was ODoH
[23:50:04] <Wulf> is there any good reason to tunnel dns over HTTP?! DNS over TLS or Quick makes sense to me. But why add another *complicated* layer?
[23:50:28] <MacGyver> yawkat: DoT can run over TLS 1.3 with an equal amount of roundtrips.
[23:50:33] <TimMc> MacGyver: I'm not making a comparison, just trying to get the shape of it.
[23:50:38] <ms7821> cuz HTTPS is allowed through corporate proxies
[23:50:58] <ms7821> it's over HTTPS, not HTTP
[23:51:11] <yawkat> MacGyver: isnt it tcp?
[23:51:19] <Wulf> ms7821: HTTPs is still HTTP.
[23:51:30] <ms7821> yeah, but the point is about traversing proxies
[23:51:34] <ms7821> HTTP doesn't give you that
[23:51:49] <MacGyver> TimMc: Then yes, what you just described is indeed the basic form of oblivious DNS, regardless of whether it's DoT or DoH underpinning it, aiui.
[23:52:21] <jbis> basically to prevent someone from blocking specifically oblivious DNS
[23:52:24] <jbis> i think
[23:52:43] <Wulf> ms7821: I don't see a good usecase for proxying DNS traffic. Corp should set up their own resolver which is reachable without proxy.
[23:52:55] <jbis> tho can't they just block traffic to the ip?
[23:53:03] <ms7821> Wulf, they do, and that's the problem
[23:53:14] <yawkat> jbis: well if it's cloudflare, thatd block half the internet too
[23:53:23] <Wulf> ms7821: why is it a problem?
[23:53:27] <jbis> that's pretty stupid
[23:53:29] <TimMc> I suppose you could also talk to the ODNS server "directly" over Tor if you really wanted to.
[23:53:41] <jbis> so now the only ones who can run a resolver are large cdns
[23:53:59] <MacGyver> yawkat: Oh, yeah, I guess if you're going QUIC then you might save a handshake roundtrip. But field testing done at NLNetLabs implied that the additional TCP roundtrip isn't actually an issue and DoH is still slower.
[23:54:07] <MacGyver> Probably due to the HTTPS overhead.
[23:54:30] <MacGyver> Though I'm not sure whether they compared DoH with HTTP/2 or 3 there.
[23:55:04] <ms7821> Wulf, many many networks run a local resolver (blocking or split horizoning DNS) but allow HTTPS out freely
[23:55:06] <yawkat> well since HTTP/2 is tcp...
[23:55:34] <MacGyver> Also I wonder how much connection reuse is a factor here, considering DNS is constantly active.
[23:55:45] <ms7821> DoT, while traditionally the way to go, will just not work in such circumstances
[23:56:02] <jbis> I must go but interesting discussion. Thanks for the links.
[23:56:03] <jbis> o/
[23:56:21] <MacGyver> jbis: Yw, hope they help.
