[14:00:09] <jotham> you're in it
[14:01:15] <Carbonflux> I mean a private room, you are the ones that can't stop thinking about cocks after all :)
[14:01:35] <jotham> you know explaining your joke makes it better, right
[14:01:46] <jotham> < carbonflux> ever notice how when you go to a war with russia, the fighters aren't wearing masks? funny that
[14:01:52] <jotham> fuck off carb
[14:01:55] <jotham> you useless piece of shit
[14:02:14] <jotham> you aren't jerry seinfeld, and he wasn't even any good
[14:02:24] <Carbonflux> its not a joke, you both are obessed with Putin's cock, clearly, granted you map it onto me, but everyone can see your deeper desires. 
[14:02:33] <jotham> we have a room
[14:02:42] <jotham> you also haven't googled 'ukranians making molotovs'
[14:02:47] <jotham> because you're butt hurt
[14:03:02] <jotham> i assure you jerry, many of them wear masks
[14:03:15] <jotham> you even lied about it yesterday to try redeem yourself
[14:03:32] <jotham> 23:47:21*Carbonfl+| they are mad at me for considering the irony of wearing masks during a war.
[14:03:36] <jotham> opposite of what you did jerry
[14:03:44] <Carbonflux> i did watch a video of them making them.
[14:03:52] <Carbonflux> it was interesting
[14:04:07] <Carbonflux> not the formula i was taught.
[14:04:28] <Carbonflux> they were using Styrofoam 
[14:04:59] <jotham> 00:15:17*Carbonfl+| all the street interviews i have seen there are no masks.
[14:05:18] <jotham> have you gone and googled it yet
[14:05:25] <jotham> 'ukrainians making masks'
[14:05:30] <jotham> since you decided yesterday to lie about it
[14:05:46] <jotham> not very buddhist anyway
[14:06:01] <jotham> and i'm definitely still annoyed about how much of a dipshit you were
[14:06:03] <Carbonflux> what would you know about it?
[14:06:13] <jotham> literally just looked at pictures from ukraine
[14:06:20] <jotham> didn't lie on ##C++-Social for no reason
[14:06:22] <jotham> a day after the argument
[14:06:39] <Carbonflux> you only know what you are told.
[14:06:45] <jotham> told by you in this case
[14:07:27] <jotham> anyway, i'm clearly picking an argument
[14:07:31] <Carbonflux> the way you talk about it react to makes me even more convinced that masks are just like arm bands.
[14:07:36] <jotham> but i can't believe you decided to rewrite your story a day later
[14:07:40] <jotham> it was pretty obnoxious
[14:07:56] <jotham> rewrite is a euphamism, right
[14:08:12] <Carbonflux> i don't really care what you think anymore, you have become toxic.
[14:08:14] <jotham>  23:47:21*Carbonfl+| they are mad at me for considering the irony of wearing masks during a war.
[14:08:18] <jotham> you didn't
[14:08:20] <jotham> you flatly said
[14:08:22] <jotham>  00:15:17*Carbonfl+| all the street interviews i have seen there are no masks.
[14:08:25] <jotham> you're a dumbshit liar
[14:08:28] <jotham> that's why i'm annoyed
[14:08:31] <jotham> and picking a fight
[14:08:36] <jotham> you tried to rewrite the process of events

[14:11:05] <jotham> you are absolutely right

[14:12:07] <jotham> it really doesn't sit well
[14:12:20] <Carbonflux> like you give a shit
[14:12:24] <jotham> i do
[14:12:29] <jotham> i told you on the night
[14:12:36] <Carbonflux> you were just joking about buildings getting bombed
[14:12:38] <jotham> my country is riven with your countries toxic colonial memes
[14:12:45] <jotham> that's why our parliament just had 3 fires today
[14:12:53] <jotham> because of american media memes
[14:13:01] <Carbonflux> you are responsible for that.
[14:13:05] <jotham> right, but i care about my country
[14:13:10] <jotham> and your toxic beliefs
[14:13:11] <Carbonflux> don't blame other people for your state of mind.
[14:13:17] <jotham> i am not, you're right
[14:13:27] <jotham> ad hominem precision shot
[14:13:40] <jotham> but nz is full of american anti vaccine shit
[14:13:46] <jotham> and that's why we just had riots at parliament today
[14:14:06] <jotham> it reminded me you brought up masks in the context of ukraine, hence me having a go again
[14:14:39] <jotham> https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/opinion/127939352/parliament-protest-the-protesters-who-set-fire-to-their-own-cause
[14:14:43] <jotham> this is all american memes
[14:14:51] <Carbonflux> your own people are thinking for themselves, your policies are anti-life.
[14:15:08] <jotham> they are just shouting things like 'ukrainians don't wear masks'
[14:15:22] <Carbonflux> you would make war on life itself and blame American when you people think for themselves and reject fascism.
[14:15:28] <jotham> there are even confederate flags at these rallys
[14:15:30] <jotham> and trump flags
[14:15:33] <jotham> and maga hats
[14:16:07] <Carbonflux> those people are there to discredit these movements.
[14:16:12] <jotham> pretty funny today the protesters blamed antifa for the fires
[14:16:15] <jotham> the fires in that video
[14:16:24] <jotham> rejecting fascism would make you anti fascist right
[14:16:31] <jotham> you're almost there Carbonflux 
[14:16:37] <jotham> almost got it
[14:16:47] <jotham> it's a meme war
[14:16:54] <jotham> and your mask crap is part of the problem
[14:17:17] <Carbonflux> no its not, free speech is never the problem.
[14:18:09] <Carbonflux> you have set yourself in the company of dictators and all your bullshit won't change how it ends.
[14:18:45] <jotham> i mean i haven't
[14:18:52] <jotham> i told you my position the other night
[14:19:25] <Carbonflux> let me ask you this, do you believe in science?
[14:19:27] <jotham> social cohesion is important during a public health crrisis, which involves signalling you are part of the group, i.e. masks don't have to be effective, if they signal you are working together to help each other, that is helpful
[14:19:43] <jotham> if you don't believe there is a public health crisis, then okay that's a different argument
[14:19:47] <Carbonflux> ya, thats the same thing arm bands do
[14:20:04] <jotham> same thing driving on the right side of the road does
[14:20:07] <Carbonflux> masks are the new fascist arm band.
[14:20:10] <jotham> and using your turning signal
[14:20:23] <jotham> and putting yoru hand over your mouth when you cough
[14:20:29] <jotham> and washing
[14:20:42] <jotham> and parking properly
[14:20:54] <jotham> civilization requires some lesser virtue signalling mate
[14:20:59] <jotham> we're a cooperative society
[14:21:05] <jotham> but not you, i get that
[14:21:20] <jotham> wearing a mask takes very very very little effort
[14:21:22] <Carbonflux> you never listen.
[14:21:38] <jotham> your subtext requires the plague to be a falsehood
[14:21:48] <Carbonflux> i wear a mask in public.
[14:21:53] <jotham> i know
[14:21:56] <jotham> you said that
[14:22:05] <Carbonflux> but you won't allow even speech.
[14:22:13] <jotham> but that's probably because it's less hassle than the alternative right
[14:22:18] <jotham> because rich whites hate the maskless
[14:22:20] <Carbonflux> you see free speech and thought as a social threat.
[14:22:21] <jotham> and you are sick of being hassled
[14:22:37] <jotham> what speech have i prohibited
[14:22:47] <jotham> you saying dipshittery like ukranians aren't wearing masks?
[14:22:50] <jotham> absolutely, because they are
[14:22:56] <jotham> even while fighting a war
[14:23:07] <jotham> face it make
[14:23:12] <Carbonflux> any discussion of the nature and symbolism of masks you suggest are a threat.
[14:23:14] <jotham> you're ideology is from a position of entitlement
[14:23:35] <Carbonflux> and yours is not?
[14:23:40] <jotham> nope
[14:23:47] <jotham> it's literally the lack of entitlement
[14:23:48] <Carbonflux> you people are totally spoiled.
[14:23:56] <jotham> we have to all signal to each other that we wont give each other the plague
[14:24:00] <jotham> through a custom of behaviour
[14:24:06] <jotham> because none of us can afford to get the plague
[14:24:09] <jotham> so even if masks don't work
[14:24:09] <Carbonflux> living on your island, talking shit.
[14:24:16] <jotham> at least we're signalling we're following the medical guidelines
[14:24:36] <Carbonflux> you are following corporate guidelines.
[14:24:46] * jotham full body eye rolls
[14:24:50] <jotham> got it, the corpos
[14:24:59] <jotham> you solved it Carbonflux 
[14:25:03] <jotham> good work
[14:25:34] <Carbonflux> thats what makes it fascism, a collaboration between government and industry.
[14:26:21] <jotham> yeah but it isn't
[14:26:26] <jotham> that's some fan fiction on your part
[14:26:32] <jotham> mask wearing isn't corpo regulated here
[14:26:42] <jotham> please mate, move the goal posts
[14:26:46] <jotham> i know you are itching to
[14:27:14] <Carbonflux> no, i am done.
[14:28:17] <jotham> i'm glad you solved your evening conspiracy anyway
[14:28:27] <jotham> we on the island are pretty private people
[14:28:35] <jotham> and you lanced our boil 
[14:32:58] <MaNI> are we still stuck in this dumb loop, the initial comment was dumb, the massive overreaction is also dumb
[14:33:25] <jotham> i wasn't gonna comment
[14:33:29] <jotham> even after he lied about it yesterday
[14:33:41] <jotham> but today we had this massive riot at parliament
[14:33:44] <jotham> and it kinda set me off again
[14:33:47] <jotham> so sorry about that
[14:33:50] <jotham> i'm over it now
[14:34:27] <MaNI> oh wow, didn't even make the news here, we don't seem to get news about NZ anymore
[14:35:05] <jotham> it's so not an issue compared to ukraine right
[14:35:07] <jotham> haha
[14:35:21] <T`aZ> is this peak RUST https://github.com/zdimension/inline-vbs ?
[14:35:41] <jotham> but there is a massive conversation in nz population in all classes and societies, and our PM even talked about it today
[14:35:48] <jotham> what we can do about people being radicalized by foreign ideas
[14:35:51] <jotham> and internet grifters
[14:35:58] <jotham> because it's a kind of social vandalism
[14:36:02] <Carbonflux> i would call it dumb exactly, maybe not well started, but i do think the contrast in priorities is interesting on a "literary" level. 
[14:36:47] <Carbonflux> war is ok, but be sure to mask up, its absurd.
[14:36:53] <MaNI> I find it curious that the protestors are automatically seen as the bad guys radicalised by foreign ideas here, and not perhaps the reverse, i.e. maybe those supporting the removal of the protestors are the ones radicalised by foreign ideas, but IDK
[14:37:10] <Carbonflux> ya
[14:37:29] <jotham> wait
[14:37:30] <Carbonflux> or maybe they are just thinking their own ideas.
[14:37:32] <jotham> that's not it
[14:37:38] <jotham> most of the protesters aren't seen like that at all
[14:37:41] <Carbonflux> its really condescending 
[14:38:13] <jotham> infact most of the footage here is of protesters telling the radicalised people to stop being radical, stop throwing things, practice love, this is a peaceful protest against government overreach etc
[14:38:31] <MaNI> people wear masks in wars for reasons other than covid, so trying to bring up war masks at all, and tie it into covid, when people are sensitive about both covid and war, is I'd say a miscalculated and dumb statement, even if being anti covid masks in general is something that might be completely sensible and for which you can claim to have a reasonable well reasoned stance
[14:38:48] <jotham> but then there are people screaming about neuremberg codes, the first ammendment, the deep state cabal, child trafficing adrenochrome etc
[14:38:52] <jotham> that's the problem
[14:39:02] <jotham> and the maori community for example, is struggling to work out what is going on
[14:39:10] <jotham> it's absolutely foreign memes
[14:39:14] <MaNI> jotham, okay, thanks for clarifying
[14:39:19] <jotham> and it's destorying our internal political process
[14:39:31] <jotham> protesting is very normal here and we're tiny so actual direct democracy works
[14:39:49] <jotham> so today with the riots, the fires, the absolute chaos
[14:39:55] <jotham> half the people were saying be chill
[14:39:58] <Carbonflux> its not about a well reasoned stance, its about looking at the symbolism of it from a literary context, what it means symbolically.
[14:40:00] <MaNI> that makes a bit more sense
[14:40:02] <jotham> and the other half were screaming about american memes
[14:40:06] <jotham> it's super weird
[14:40:13] <jotham> and we don't know what to do about it as a culture
[14:41:05] <MaNI> remove jacinda for starters I reckon
[14:41:09] <jotham> i get that the entire planets psyche is frayed right now
[14:41:21] <MaNI> whens the next elections that side?
[14:41:23] <jotham> pm ardern will leave when she's no longer capable of being elected
[14:41:32] <Carbonflux> thinking about the dream logic of things does not have anything to do with rational narratives, its an attempt at deconstruction of thought and ideas.
[14:41:34] <jotham> but the country overwhelmingly voted for her, a very rare thing
[14:41:39] <jotham> normally our governments are coalitions
[14:41:52] <MaNI> and that sounds like a large problem
[14:41:59] <jotham> not really
[14:42:04] <jotham> the system takes care of itself
[14:42:08] <jotham> our cycles are every 3 years
[14:42:08] <MaNI> coalitions are much better
[14:42:10] <jotham> btw
[14:42:10] <MaNI> samethink is bad
[14:42:11] <jotham> sure
[14:42:15] <jotham> but right wingers hate coalitions
[14:42:19] <jotham> so it creates a new kind of problem
[14:42:25] <jotham> they think it's unfair if you don't win outright
[14:42:32] <jotham> except when a young womans party wins outright
[14:42:36] <MaNI> the entire country overwhelmingly all rallying behind one person is an emergence of samethink, or an indicator of it at least
[14:42:38] <jotham> we already went through that last 2 election cycles
[14:42:49] <MaNI> and many of your other problems are probably a syptom of this
[14:42:49] <jotham> it was only 60%
[14:43:00] <jotham> and it was only one 3 year phase
[14:43:18] <jotham> and like i said, the Liberals, tories, conservatives, hate the idea of coalition anyway
[14:43:27] <jotham> so it's only a problem when it's a neoliberal majority
[14:43:42] <MaNI> all politicians do, its when the public buys into that that you have a problem
[14:43:56] <MaNI> I say th at coming from a country where we have that problem 
[14:43:58] <jotham> my point is getting rid of pm ardern wont change anything
[14:44:06] <jotham> the problem is literally our inability to work out how to deal with foreign memes
[14:44:20] <jotham> and foreign astroturfing money
[14:44:34] <jotham> why are people screaming about the first amendment
[14:44:37] <MaNI> your PM is basically a foreign meme but I guess thats another story
[14:44:38] <jotham> lack of basic education, right
[14:44:53] <Carbonflux> as long as you blame others you will never solve the problem. 
[14:44:55] <jotham> i understand our pm is a foreign meme, and i apologise for that, i can't fix that
[14:45:02] <jotham> i blame us Carbonflux 
[14:45:07] <jotham> that's what i just spent 20 minutes saying
[14:45:10] <jotham> you dipshit
[14:45:13] <jotham> we don't know how to process foreign memes
[14:45:17] <jotham> and we have to develop a solution
[14:45:21] <jotham> all communities are addressing it
[14:45:39] <jotham> it's not a blame game, it's a problem with working out how to process it
[14:45:55] <jotham> but yes, you wanking about ukrainians and masks is very very dumb too
[14:46:18] <Carbonflux> maybe its not the memes that are the problem, maybe people are just using them because they don't have anyway to articulate their issues.
[14:46:27] <jotham> sure that's true
[14:46:33] <MaNI> anyway, entire world is way too emotional right now, for good reason of course, but its something we need to try recover from not regress even further into
[14:46:35] <jotham> which is something we still have to figure out how to solve
[14:46:40] <jotham> which is the main conversation in nz right now
[14:46:43] <jotham> in all kinds of communities
[14:47:01] <jotham> yeah i feel like a dipshit about being upset about my country while there is a fucking war going on
[14:47:05] <jotham> but that song at least cheers me up
[14:47:08] <Carbonflux> the problem is a crisis in expert culture.
[14:47:16] <jotham> https://twitter.com/Punisher_Cat/status/1498940243139088386
[14:47:26] <jotham> too bad russian and ukranians are getting nailed
[14:47:31] <jotham> but gallows humour
[14:47:40] <jotham> i haven't seen the same gallows humour since i lived in vietnam
[14:49:30] <jotham> bayraktar is the turkish drone the ukranians use
[14:49:36] <jotham> we're approaching diamond age
[14:50:12] <MaNI> heh
[14:50:40] <jotham> the soup line gets me for some reason
[14:59:14] <jotham> https://twitter.com/Osinttechnical/status/1498952937653125120
[14:59:16] <jotham> > The lead Russian soldier is walking around with two hand grenades held in the air.
[14:59:19] <jotham> that's how you go to a meeting in 2022 i guess
[15:00:30] <jotham> i don't know what they think den haag will do with their war crimes court
[15:02:34] <MaNI> the problem with all these international codes and the concept of war crimes in general etc. is that they all rely on the idea that all parties involved in a war think that they will ever be in a position where they will be held accountable
[15:02:55] <jotham> absolutely
[15:03:05] <jotham> it's a very white-guy-reckons version of reality, right
[15:03:35] <jotham> people that have grown up within a legal system where they are culpable 
[15:04:18] <MaNI> right, like you see it here a lot where people are like "lets make x" illegal, but x is probably already illegal its just that the people doing it know it can't be enforced and don't care
[15:04:37] <jotham> personally i assume putin is in a situation like we've learned from american mafia movies, where he cannot actually give up or capitulate, he has to fight to stay top dog, or be shot for being lame
[15:04:38] <MaNI> but when you come from a lawful upbringing the idea that people can simply disobey laws doesn't really register to you
[15:04:44] <jotham> which changes the calculus a lot
[15:05:13] <MaNI> yeah its a bit scary, because he will be backed into a corner with nothing to lose, kind of dangerous
[15:05:18] <jotham> yeah
[15:05:38] <jotham> i really find the western reckons on this conflict very agitating
[15:05:42] <jotham> 'what if his money is frozen'
[15:05:45] <jotham> bitch
[15:05:46] <jotham> he has so much power
[15:06:00] <jotham> he doesn't need to worry about his kids university or mansions
[15:06:08] <jotham> the UK and the Netherlands wont even sanction his kids
[15:06:14] <jotham> he doesn't have to worry
[15:06:17] <jotham> he just has to stay afloat
[15:07:07] <jotham> i read a thing today about where the whole denazification idea putin talked about came from
[15:07:14] <jotham> and it's from both ww2 and 2014
[15:07:30] <jotham> in ww2 some local ukranians sided with the nazis thinking it'd overthrow the soviets
[15:07:36] <jotham> which ended badly, the nazis killed them
[15:08:08] <jotham> and in 2014 they integrated some actual neo nazi factions (azov) into their fighting forces because they needed manpower
[15:08:20] <jotham> but since 2014 the far right parties have gone from 5% to 2% support democratically
[15:08:40] <jotham> so ukraine is actually denazifying themselves already
[15:09:16] <jotham> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaboration_in_German-occupied_Ukraine
[15:09:30] <jotham> it's that classic tactic, a good lie involves a kernel of truth
[15:09:36] <jotham> that's what putins riding on
[15:10:48] <ERROH> why would you care where Carbonflux got the idea of nazis from?
[15:10:52] <ERROH> i mean putin
[15:11:20] <ERROH> couple years ago he blamed poland for starting ww2
[15:11:27] <ERROH> i know nobody noticed
[15:11:40] <ERROH> it doesn't matter anywhere but internally
[15:11:44] <jotham> you guys had probably just failed to deliver spintires again
[15:11:47] <jotham> so i was probably pissy
[15:11:55] <ERROH> poeple in moscow and leningrad still support him
[15:14:26] <MaNI> I probably didn't read that conversation, I skip huge amounts of what goes on in here
[15:19:23] <ERROH> i never understood putting energy into actual discussion with the putin dick garage, so yeah 
[15:19:38] <dukwon> T`aZ, https://i.redd.it/39xidyyh0xk81.jpg
[15:27:18] <T`aZ> lol, completely mixed everything
[15:27:35] <T`aZ> we say quatre-vingt here :D , but not soixante-dix
[15:27:56] <T`aZ> the whole thing has a history obviously
[15:29:07] <jotham> shouldn't google lens be able to translate that text
[15:29:10] <jotham> :\
[15:30:12] <T`aZ> jotham: the important point is to make fun of the french
[15:31:32] <jotham> i can do that
[15:31:43] <jotham> they blew up the rainbow warrior, the green peace ship, here in NZ
[15:31:49] <jotham> and our secret service caught them
[15:31:54] <jotham> and then we had to give them to the french
[15:31:59] <jotham> and they got medals when they got back
[15:32:03] <jotham> made our entire country angry at them
[15:32:06] <jotham> haha
[15:32:11] <jotham> way before america and their dipshit freedom fries
[15:32:19] <jotham> plus i worked for ubisoft on 2 jobs
[15:32:26] <jotham> and that was very annoying
[15:32:44] <Carbonflux> ERROH, its not like you could have an actual discussion with anyone, all you seem to do is brag about yourself and shit on others. 
[15:32:50] <jotham> maybe they are nice people, i have enjoyed some french movies
[15:45:33] <Carbonflux> Quebecers don't really consider themselves French, i remember them getting insulted by it when i was living in Canada.
[15:47:27] <Carbonflux> which in fact always seemed very French to me.
[15:56:19] *** Quits: Carbonflux (~Carbonflu@c-66-235-54-179.sea.wa.customer.broadstripe.net) (Quit: When all you have are solutions, everything is a problem.)
[16:08:42] <jotham> MaNI: man that hit me hard aye
[16:08:47] <jotham> MaNI: and you're 100% right
[16:08:53] <jotham> MaNI: and i can't fix it and i don't like it
[16:09:08] <jotham> MaNI: and i think it contributes to the gross sexism about female leaders that pm ardern is facing
[16:10:01] <jotham> sorry still annoyed about it, not annoyed at you or anything
[16:10:18] <MaNI> yeah its okay I understand, well a bit
[16:10:18] <jotham> i just hate our pm keeps getting turned into a 'liberal darling' by foreign media
[16:10:29] <jotham> when she pragmatically deals with shitshow after shitshow
[16:10:34] <jotham> and it shouldn't be gendered
[16:10:42] <jotham> and shouldn't be used as a culture war tool by foreign press
[16:11:02] <jotham> i never know what to say
[16:11:11] <jotham> like should we just get a guy that was the head of a corp
[16:11:23] <jotham> she was voted democratically in by a sizable part of the pop
[16:11:27] <jotham> and not because overseas ideas
[16:11:33] <jotham> cause overseas ideas are toxic to wome
[16:11:38] <jotham> and she didn't do any populist fash
[16:11:46] <jotham> and this is the bit i hate as well
[16:11:52] <jotham> neolibs get off scott free
[16:12:01] <jotham> like tony blaire and george bush junour
[16:12:04] <jotham> junior
[16:12:06] <jotham> she's one of them
[16:12:12] <jotham> but happens to be a woman
[16:12:16] <jotham> so all the criticism is bad too
[16:12:21] <jotham> all the critism she gets, i get
[16:12:24] <jotham> is basically gendered
[16:12:29] <jotham> and based on media memes overseas
[16:12:36] <jotham> it's not a healthy way to work a government anyway
[16:13:12] <jotham> but i appreciate foreign media use her as a kind of rallying point for a certian kind of shit belief
[16:13:19] <MaNI> democracy is fucked lets just go back to monarchies
[16:13:24] <jotham> but i don't think that anyone gets neolibs aren't even left wing
[16:13:50] <jotham> neolibs were designed to destory unions and incorporate minority issues
[16:13:55] <jotham> ensuring capitalism is maintained
[16:14:01] <jotham> that's what she is
[16:14:17] <jotham> but also she's done an okay job, and i'm annoyed it should be telegraphed to other peoples causes
[16:15:14] <jotham> i generally figure people overseas that are against the pm are doing it out of some weird misdirected sexism or the fact they have been brow beaten by an icon that isn't in practice what it is
[16:15:19] <jotham> it's just what some cunts want it to be
[16:15:50] <jotham> politics is toxic af
[16:16:55] <MaNI> I personally dislike her covid policies etc. don't really care what sex she is, but I only follow whats going on there superficially and also of course her actions are not exactly in isolation but potentially just doing what her party as a whole (or maybe even the country as a whole) wants
[16:17:22] <MaNI> entire world has been too fucked last few years to fully understand whats going on in other peoples countries, full time job just understanding whats going on in your own
[16:20:22] <jotham> it's not even her politics
[16:20:37] <jotham> the covid is set by our single payer health care system and our director general of health
[16:21:39] <MaNI> news this side of the world is that our government is having lavish parties at russian embassies while they invade Ukraine, so we are once again the assholes of the world
[16:21:56] <jotham> i read news24
[16:21:59] <jotham> hehee
[16:22:15] <jotham> the last thing i saw was students destorying cars at a university
[16:25:28] <MaNI> haha, thats just a normal tuesday
[16:26:06] <jotham> anyway i really need to reenforce
[16:26:21] <jotham> our pm is doing a good job for us, but it's a massively awkward thing she's been picked up by foreign press
[16:26:26] <jotham> embarassing
[16:26:33] <jotham> and none of us want that
[16:26:39] <jotham> christ
[16:26:58] <jotham> foreign media just need a liberal darling
[16:27:07] <jotham> it's horrendous
[16:32:21] <MaNI> well I think she uses it as a tool, I mean I don't think shes turning the attention down, e.g. the whole john oliver thing, so cuts both ways I guess, I think thats sort of what I was hinting at with the thing about her being a foreign meme
[16:32:48] <MaNI> I mean how much of her local popularity is due to her foreign media thing which in turn then influences peple locally, IDK
