[00:01:00] <[itchyjunk]> because i don't understand what that means
[00:01:35] <mrig> was curses an attempt to standardise terminal display?
[00:01:36] <vdamewood> [itchyjunk]: Back in the ancient days, computers didn't have screens. You would connect to them with a device that was meant to be a remote typewriter.
[00:01:37] <GeDaMo> A teletype is like a mechanical typewriter, 100 baud refers to the communication speed with the computer
[00:02:42] <vdamewood> Normally, you'd plug your teletype into a special line for teletypes, and someone else would plug in theirs, and what you typed showed up on their paper.

[00:03:22] <vdamewood> Someone got the bright idea to use that to communicate with a computer. So what you typed was sent to the computer, and the computer would send back teletype messages as its output.

[00:04:05] <vdamewood> 100 baud means that the pulse on the line could change about 100 times per second, which meant you could see about 10 characters output per second.
[00:04:26] <vdamewood> or send about 10 characters per second.

[00:05:17] <[itchyjunk]> how ever that works
[00:05:22] <vdamewood> For the most part, TTY lines used binary encodings.
[00:06:15] <vdamewood> TTY = TeleTYpe
[00:07:45] <vdamewood> So, just think, if you wanted to output a full screen of characters, at 80 characters per line, and 24 characters per screen, it would take 3 minutes and 12 seconds.

[00:09:02] <vdamewood> GeDaMo: Though, it's my understanding that telecom companies in the day offered dedicated tty lines, separate from the telephone system.
[00:09:06] <[itchyjunk]> it kinda makes sense that people would output to paper at some point
[00:09:16] <[itchyjunk]> the input via paper is a bit weirder
[00:09:18] <pyzozord> actually I wanted to set my terminal in low baud but couldn't figure out how to do it
[00:09:29] <[itchyjunk]> but i can imagine inputing truth table or some such somehow
[00:09:42] <GeDaMo> Yeah, possibly
[00:09:47] <GeDaMo> I never had to deal with those
[00:09:56] <vdamewood> So, no acoustic couplers for TTYs.
[00:10:24] <GeDaMo> I seem to remember some TTY devices having acoustic couplers built-in
[00:10:33] <pyzozord> I think seeing characters stream in over time would be pretty cool
[00:10:54] <pyzozord> I might do it now with my terminal actually
[00:10:56] <vdamewood> Hmm... I guess it would make sense for some companies to want to try to use the phone line instead to save on the cost of leasing a TTY line.
[00:11:26] <vdamewood> Especially if they only sent a handful of communiqués per month. And the long-distance charges were cheaper.
[00:11:40] <InPhase> vdamewood: I called one of those services as a child, using my dialup modem.  I saw the number listed somewhere, and didn't know what it was, so I called it up with my modem.  The person on the other end was typing stuff back asking me if I wanted to make a call.  I quickly figured out what it was for from that.

[01:46:45] <InPhase> [itchyjunk]: Imagine trying to make a formal mathematical proof that an IRC client is correct.
[01:46:50] <[itchyjunk]> the program gets stuc in endless goal
[01:47:02] <[itchyjunk]> InPhase, yes, that's program as a proof
[01:47:21] <[itchyjunk]> if you can exebit there is a witness of such a client then that is your proof
[01:47:28] <InPhase> [itchyjunk]: To do it, you have to exactly specify all the behavior of an IRC client.  That has similar complexity to writing an IRC client.
[01:47:38] <[itchyjunk]> yes
[01:47:41] <[itchyjunk]> it's hard.
[01:47:50] <InPhase> And, has as much room for error as writing an IRC client.
[01:47:55] <[itchyjunk]> but if you prove that formally, it can't later turn out to not be true.
[01:48:11] <[itchyjunk]> you might not be able to prove something.
[01:48:15] <[itchyjunk]> but if you do, that's that
[01:48:23] <InPhase> You will know that your program exactly matches what you wrote out that it SHOULD do.  But how do you prove that what you wrote out that it should do is what it was actually supposed to do?

[01:50:24] <[itchyjunk]> complexity exists.
[01:50:27] <[itchyjunk]> I am not arguying that.
[01:50:33] <[itchyjunk]> And you might have errors.
[01:50:44] <[itchyjunk]> But if you do, you won't be able to prove it.
[01:50:46] <InPhase> Which means that your proof did not buy correctness.

[02:09:45] <[itchyjunk]> Proof is a proof.
[02:09:50] <[itchyjunk]> real world has nothing to do with it.
[02:09:50] <InPhase> [itchyjunk]: You cannot prove general programs correct.
[02:10:07] <[itchyjunk]> You can program any "program" as defined in type theory.
[02:10:14] <[itchyjunk]> Computer programs fall under that "program" part.
[02:10:16] <pyzozord> [itchyjunk]: it has everything to do with it, that is what I was talking about. You are missing the point
[02:10:36] <[itchyjunk]> type theory is a mathematical concept. it has nothing to do with "real world".
[02:10:48] <LjL> then why the hell was the topic IRC clients
[02:10:52] <LjL> "IRC clients" are pretty real world shit
[02:10:52] <InPhase> [itchyjunk]: Do you think you can extend type theory to make a proven correct IRC client?
[02:10:52] <[itchyjunk]> If you write an irc client in Agda, you can precisely prove it.
[02:11:00] <[itchyjunk]> yes.
[02:11:06] <[itchyjunk]> write a client in adga.
[02:11:11] <[itchyjunk]> it self checks.
[02:11:13] <InPhase> [itchyjunk]: How do you know the definition is correct?
[02:11:23] <[itchyjunk]> "definition is correct"
[02:11:24] <LjL> "you don't prove definitions"
[02:11:27] <[itchyjunk]> what does that mean?
[02:11:35] <InPhase> [itchyjunk]: How do you know it does what IRC clients should?
[02:11:40] <LjL> that the definition matches what people think of the behavior of an actual IRC client
[02:11:53] <[itchyjunk]> you make it do what you want to do.
[02:12:00] <[itchyjunk]> it's code you write
[02:12:04] <[itchyjunk]> it's not magic
[02:12:04] <LjL> then just write it to make it do that
[02:12:06] <pyzozord> what you want to do might not be what is the best thing
[02:12:07] <LjL> forget about "proving" it
[02:12:18] <pyzozord> for example because you are not aware that you should want something better
[02:12:33] <pyzozord> or you might want something plain wrong
[02:12:40] <InPhase> [itchyjunk]: If I make an agda "Hello World" and call the filename "irc_client.agda", is it a correct IRC client?
[02:13:07] <InPhase> [itchyjunk]: Clearly it has been proven.
[02:13:08] <[itchyjunk]> At this point, i am not sure if you're actually worked with proof assistance or not

[07:59:35] <a_train[m]> man, c++ is toast. I hate to admit it.
[07:59:53] <a_train[m]> I like to believe that I write good code, but. Rust has your back.
[08:01:44] <webNET4> is toast? 2/3 of "the brower"s are written in it
[08:02:17] <webNET4> maybe even 3/3
[08:02:51] <leduyquang753> I feel more restricted and uncomfortable in Rust than in C++.
[08:06:15] <a_train[m]> webnet4, rust has been a player in the league for what... 3 years? Of course the world is written in legacy code.
[08:06:38] <webNET4> yeah what percentage is it up to i don't keep track
[08:06:48] <quazimodo> wow
[08:06:50] <quazimodo> just... wow
[08:06:55] <quazimodo> you can't help yourself eh
[08:06:57] <webNET4> >50 by 2050 ?
[08:07:03] <a_train[m]> It's like saying that 80% of all people with cancer dies, therefore cancer isn't toast when a perfect cure for all cancers emerge.
[08:07:35] <webNET4> if you wait too long the toast gets moldy
[08:07:54] <arahael> a_train[m]: Way longer, I think.
[08:07:58] <quazimodo> webNET4: honestly dude you strike me as one of the unhelpful & oppositional experts you find on stack overflow that just manage to derail things, i'm going to block you
[08:08:33] <webNET4> k bye
[08:09:02] <oldlaptop> a_train[m]: something like C++ is never going away - it might, after a few more decades, be the same kind of shambling zombie COBOL is, but it is not going away
[08:09:17] <webNET4> no more time i have to wait for clarifications on 1) why to use docker, and 2_ wtf is a partner API or wth you're even talking about
[08:09:33] <a_train[m]> c++ is getting better and I'm not saying that it's bad as such. I am saying that rust has some very strong merits and believe that one day, rust will be the better choice over c++ for any new project where c++ would otherwise be an option.
[08:10:17] <a_train[m]> oldlaptop: that is a possibility.
[08:10:30] <quazimodo> linux community is starting to say some very rusty words
[08:10:46] <quazimodo> they'll begin writing low hanging fruit in rustlang soon I think
[08:11:16] <quazimodo> once the kernel starts to have bits of it written in rustlang, and developers manage to write safe parallelised stuff for games in rustlang modules I see it growing
[08:11:22] <oldlaptop> C++-as-COBOL-in-ten-years is, I would say, a *pessimistic* estimate from the C++-boosterism perspective
[08:12:11] <quazimodo> the other thing to note is that where C++ was good for business C# is now the way to go, and where C++ was good for performance & capability there is a ?better? fit in rust
[08:12:26] <quazimodo> so yeah, I see C++ being picked less often for new things
[08:12:38] <oldlaptop> (to be clear I don't have a dog in that fight; I dislike C++ and haven't fooled with rust - I would hate cargo with the burning fire of a thousand suns, though, most likely)
[08:12:55] <quazimodo> it's not even a 'is this  tech good/bad' but more like 'i am a business, should I use C++' and  the answer is looking like no more & more often
[08:13:17] <quazimodo> oldlaptop: I havent seen much hate for cargo, what's it done to you?
[08:13:25] <leduyquang753> oldlaptop Hey we are kinda on the same boat, I also dislike people shoving "USE CARGO" into people's faces.
[08:13:37] <oldlaptop> "I am a business, should I use C++?" is not a question that contains enough information for a reasonable answer
[08:13:52] <webNET4> don't expect any reasonable answers here
[08:14:14] <leduyquang753> Carbo just takes away a lot of flexibility I would have from C++ regarding building a project.
[08:14:17] <oldlaptop> quazimodo: Nothing in particular, which is why that's not present/perfect tense
[08:14:17] <leduyquang753> Cargo
[08:14:45] <quazimodo> oldlaptop: i'm making it easy to digest, yes everything has a lot more scope to it but on the face of it, and on balance, i am seeing movements that indicate to me that C++ isn't the serious choice now when it absolutely was before
[08:14:46] <oldlaptop> but I generally dislike language-specific package managers at best, particularly when it's infeasible to work outside them
[08:14:53] <quazimodo> I work a lot in corporate innovation 
[08:15:17] <webNET4> rofl
[08:15:27] <quazimodo> no one is considering building their new stuff in C++ unless there is a realllly compelling reason, or the CTO is a C++ person
[08:15:44] <leduyquang753> If anything I am looking forward to GCC having a Rust front-end.
[08:15:50] <leduyquang753> quazimodo I do.
[08:16:26] <quazimodo> leduyquang753: can you elaborate on the flexibility, i'm not sure that I understand and i'm pretty curious
[08:16:54] <leduyquang753> I am not tied to a specific package manager, I don't need to set up a whole system of folders, I can do it either manually or script it, etc.
[08:17:27] <oldlaptop> I'm given to understand cargo wants to (a) download (b) build and (c) install absolutely everything for you, and it's at the least difficult to work around that.
[08:17:46] <oldlaptop> If that's not broadly true, perhaps I only would hate it about as much as (say) pip.
[08:17:49] <leduyquang753> Yes but I would like to be able to not use it when I don't need it.
[08:18:11] <quazimodo> I am privileged in that I've used elixir & ruby's package manager a lot, they make life so easy
[08:18:29] <quazimodo> so i'm not sure why cargo causes a problem
[08:18:58] <quazimodo> if it does the fetch, build & install well, and you can specify the versions/repos of you want to get, then I don't see the problem
[08:19:08] <quazimodo> does it do those things  in a bad way?
[08:19:19] <quazimodo> like bad caching or it's slow somehow?
[08:19:28] <leduyquang753> I just don't have enough control.
[08:19:54] <leduyquang753> With C++ I can choose to place my dependencies whereever I want and then let the compiler know.
[08:20:02] <quazimodo> this isn't me challenging you, more trying to understand, we've built pretty wide scaled stuff with small & large teams etc, what control do you need?
[08:20:07] <quazimodo> why do you need to place them where ever?
[08:20:11] <oldlaptop> In particular, I do *not* want build processes downloading random stuff all by themselves whenever they feel like it.

[08:21:59] *** Treebeard is now known as BenLand100
[08:21:59] <quazimodo> oldlaptop: no, build system fetches from wherever it wants to and then the stuff gets tested against known signatures
[08:22:09] <quazimodo> though
[08:22:22] <quazimodo> i think one of the devs set up a "local" cache in our network
[08:22:37] <quazimodo> so, yes, but not much manual loading of deps into it, just made it faster to get the deps onto the build machines
[08:22:44] <quazimodo> just a cache
[08:22:51] <quazimodo> it wasn't for security but for build speed
[08:23:16] <quazimodo> security was all through audit & self signing the deps
[08:24:36] <oldlaptop> so after all the headache you're still relying on random servers scattered randomly across the internet for your builds to work?
[08:24:37] <quazimodo> which is how it should be in my opinion, if you dont trust any package repository you're going to always be safe, and a cache server can make it quick
[08:24:37] <quazimodo> well your local cache server solves that problem, and random servers scattered randomly across the internet have worked almost every single time for the last 10 years
[08:24:51] <oldlaptop> this is my unconvinced face :|
[08:24:52] <webNET4> not always, the dev you're pulling from's key could be stolen/copied-without-knowlege

[08:25:10] <quazimodo> if it's fast, cheap & you have signed the package yourself or a trusted party has signed for you, then it's great
[08:25:48] <quazimodo> i think being convinced is one thing but the fact is that the entire web ecosystem is using this approach & they've moved to true CI/CD using it
[08:26:13] <quazimodo> I have more problems with my teams actually programming the wrong thing now than I do with deps/build
[08:26:30] <quazimodo> deps & build were more of a problem before this approach, in my experience
[08:26:30] <oldlaptop> "all the node people are doing it!" does not sounds like a good argument to me
[08:26:53] <quazimodo> the web ecosystem is more than node
[08:27:14] <quazimodo> and i'm not saying that it's good because lots of people do it

[10:24:08] <blahboybaz> hmm
[10:27:49] <blahboybaz> I been reading the mdn on proxy and they're losing me somewhere along the line. For example, in the second exaimple given in the mdn - section starting with  " To customise the proxy, we define functions on the handler object: " - they give a parameter  " receiver "  but receiver does not seem to be userd anywhere in the example and it is not explicitly defined before that. I thought it might be 
[10:27:55] <blahboybaz> a callback but since I don't see it used I don't think it's that. Its one example that is confusing me in that doc

[10:52:23] <DPA> You can see more here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy/Proxy
[10:52:23] <DPA> For "get": argument "receiver", it says: Either the proxy or an object that inherits from the proxy. So for x=new Proxy(y,{get(target, property, receiver){}}), when accessing x.anything, the get handler will called with receiver=x, target=y, property="anything". I think "this" is also x.

[13:01:01] <pyzozord> I'm not sure how true that is, but I'd love it if language wasn't a major factor in code redability
[13:01:03] <mrig> oh a parser for s expressions in AWK, dang I'm not going to get into trying to read that right now :)
[13:01:17] <mrig> pyzozord: sure it is.
[13:01:30] <mrig> including the underlying human language.
[13:01:35] <user51> it also really depends on what the language provides
[13:01:37] <mrig> its grammar.
[13:01:57] <user51> the awk code above could use some helping of function pointers, for example. but at that point might as well do C.
[13:02:41] <pyzozord> I think sometimes you just neeed to say things different or even say other things to get the poin across well. The real trouble comes when someone is trying to speak polish in english and they end up with ponglish
[13:02:42] <mrig> What is the term for the language used to write a program, not the programming language but the choice of native language?
[13:02:46] <user51> you can - quite painfuly - emulate pointers in awk by assigning specific length unique ids to stuff. but once stuff gets nested, it becomes quite ugly.
[13:03:20] *** Joins: plastico (~plastico@neomutt/plastico)
[13:03:27] <mrig> user51: ah right, I gather that the use of pointers in AWK is quite restricted.
[13:03:41] <user51> nah, there are no pointers in awk at all
[13:03:46] <pyzozord> I actually think my ideal language would do just that
[13:03:48] <mrig> For reading and formatting data really I suppose.
[13:04:22] <user51> if you consider what a pointer is, it's possible to implement it to some degree. but pointers to pointers become.. you just think, yeah this isn't the right language
[13:04:24] <mrig> pyzozord: there are also more involved types of grammar for human language. 
[13:04:31] <mrig> far more structured.
[13:04:41] <Trashlord> maybe I *should* write a C compiler. I wouldn't even know where to begin but I'm sure I could figure it out eventually
[13:04:43] <mrig> than we use at the moment.
[13:05:32] <mrig> user51: just a hunch, but is sounds as thought the pointers is AWK are somehow linked to C's unions too.
[13:06:41] <piou> Trashlord: writting a compiler is fun, but I'm not sure I would recommend C as a first language to write a compiler for, it's full of quirks :)
[13:06:50] <user51> mrig: how are they related?
[13:07:06] <pyzozord> hmm I think my ideal language would have just stack and arrays.
[13:07:19] <pyzozord> But arrays could be of type byte
[13:07:22] <mrig> user51: oh I am speculating, I read on here the other day that the pointers in AWK are coupled to data size.
[13:07:34] <mrig> so one naturally thinks of unions.

[13:25:29] <mrig> nitrix: I am not sure to be honest, self discipline and consistency is required when using it, but I do love the way in which it is mechanical in aspect.
[13:25:36] <nitrix> It's me following up on your return to C and curious if that meant that you're now capable to appreciate on a level you couldn't before, or that its flaws are glaringly obvious.
[13:26:00] <mrig> not flaws, just its nature more so.
[13:26:29] <mrig> its 'spikyness', wrought with danger for sure.
[13:26:39] <mrig> but, depends entire upon how you use it.
[13:27:09] <nitrix> Right. I think that's where I'm at too. It has a purpose/vision and sticks to it. Once you're aligned to that, it's very predictable and doesn't get much in your way.
[13:27:35] <pyzozord> I think most people like more structured languages. Otherwise things like Rust wouldn't get so popular
[13:28:00] <mrig> quite, I've always thought that this would be the case, but it is very difficult to be allowed the space in which to practice, in the current coding paradigm.
[13:29:59] <piou> pyzozord: I don't know if it's about liking them more... Things like "I have a vision and I stick to it" only scale with effort, and the more people work on a project the better it becomes to find bugs when developing and not days or months later in production
[13:30:01] <pyzozord> Funnily enough I'm not a big fan of ambiguity in human languages, but I think I'm mostly ok with it in programming languages. Probably the reverse of most people

[13:31:16] <piou> yeah, I'm not a fan of either but I excuse human language more easily than programming ones
[13:31:27] <Daemonick> Too many ITs but there are so few who can really and actually write codes
[13:31:33] <pyzozord> I think maybe I have certain level of certainess and ambiguity I like and human languages or no certain enough, and most programming languages are not ambigue enough
[13:31:52] <pyzozord> s/or no/are not/
[13:33:04] <piou> Maybe the reason why I accept it in human languages is because ambiguity is often its own space of expression, allowing for subtlety that leads to poetry or humour. And as much as I like beautiful code I don't think a programming language is the place to have poetry and humour.
[13:33:31] <pyzozord> I think I disagree with that
[13:33:51] <piou> what part?
[13:34:00] <pyzozord> or maybe I agree with what was said
[13:34:16] <nitrix> It puts a lot of trust onto the programmers, but the responsibilities are derived from few concepts that can be learned reasonably easily. On the other hand, you have safer languages that don't trust programmers, but then you have to deal with the various abstractions that are meant to cover all variations/permutations of all edge cases deriving from those concepts.
[13:34:29] <piou> pyzozord: It's funny how unclear you can be on a discussion on ambiguity ^_^
[13:34:33] <pyzozord> but I believe that using programming languages is inheritently a creative act
[13:34:45] <piou> pyzozord: oh, that I agree with completely
[13:35:21] <mrig> nitrix: I find that the safety aspect impedes learning and leads to cargo cult mythologies.
[13:36:27] <mrig> piou: yes I agree with you there, but think that there is space for both and also equate this to issues of psychosis, as such it is rather less romantic.
[13:36:36] <pyzozord> Hmm I dont think I have a fully formed opinion about safety and strictness of programming languages.

[15:09:08] <alguien> Here's the plan, guys. A new cross-platform framework for mobile development. But only for iOS. How is that cross-platform you ask? Easy, the API is the Android SDK. We write apps for native Android and it works on iOS. That's the only reason we use cross-platform tools anyway, to support iOS users. Of course, due to the translation layer, it won't work as well on iOS as it does on Android. That's a good thing. People stop using iOS on account on 
[15:09:08] <alguien> apps being slower on it, and we are finally free of the poisonous apple!

[17:41:09] <pyzozord> Well I do sometimes but very rarely. Most of the time I feel it's a waste of time to read lengthy rationale why called is called "x" instead of "eks"
[17:41:27] <Akronymus> Oh that's fair.
[17:41:45] <Akronymus> I find the why quite important, but I can see where you are coming from.
[17:42:31] <pyzozord> I mean if I am deeply curious about some technology, sure, than I'll read it. But if it's strictly utalitarian stuff for work I probably won't bother
[17:43:12] <Akronymus> I sometimes, altough rarely, have to read a RFC because of me encountering some edge case.
[17:43:26] <Akronymus> Which then turns out, the other side didn't implement it properly.
[17:43:34] <Akronymus> So, its useless after all.
[17:44:20] <oldlaptop> as standards documents go, RFCs are shockingly non-evil
[17:44:30] <oldlaptop> as a general class, anyhow
[17:44:38] <pyzozord> I did read RFCs a bit about irc and a bit about telnet. Mostly out of curiosity
[17:44:47] <Akronymus> Ever had to acquire some ISO spec? oldlaptop

[17:45:23] <oldlaptop> not really - they do make "drafts" of C standard revisions available gratis
[17:45:49] <Akronymus> Yeah, the drafts usually work well enough.
[17:46:01] <pyzozord> Akronymus: yes, ISO/IEC 9945 :P
[17:46:08] <Akronymus> Altough, some companies demand you to meet the exact iso standard.
[17:46:20] <Akronymus> Which you have to somehow source.
[17:46:26] <oldlaptop> so then they get to pay for it
[17:46:33] <Akronymus> In an ideal world.
[17:46:45] <oldlaptop> one way or another they do! :P
[17:46:48] <Akronymus> Usually it is: We only consider you for this contract if you meat ISO xxxx

[18:03:35] <[itchyjunk]> oh something different
[18:03:39] <Akronymus> Linter is for example enforcing that you only use tabs for identation.
[18:03:44] <Akronymus> Rather than mixing in spaces.
[18:03:49] <[itchyjunk]> ah
[18:03:50] <pulse> [itchyjunk], linter is a sort of static checker for languages that aren't static

[18:05:09] <[itchyjunk]> so it's asthetics? since compiler wouldn't care later anyways right?
[18:05:09] <pulse> a linter is a tool that helps you find issues like that before they become problematic
[18:05:12] <pulse> it's a code quality tool
[18:05:15] <Akronymus> Naming of variables/fields 
[18:05:16] <[itchyjunk]> oh i see, like removing lints on clothes
[18:05:22] <Akronymus> A linter can do many things.
[18:05:33] <password> yeah its makes your code cleaner
[18:05:42] <password> its a loos term
[18:05:45] <pulse> [itchyjunk], no, it's not just aesthetics. it's code quality in the best case and avoiding bugs in the worst case

[18:06:56] <[itchyjunk]> my professor is a linter
[18:07:03] <[itchyjunk]> he makes us use specific variable names
[18:07:18] <Akronymus> At least they are well named, right?
[18:07:25] <[itchyjunk]> yes
[18:07:26] <password> yeah , thats extactly why i want one here
[18:07:39] <password> because we have a rule that says all variables must start with caps
[18:07:50] <password> then i forget and boss throws a fit
[18:08:00] <password> even though my code is probably the most robust here
[18:09:08] <Akronymus> Huh, I think I just had an epiphany.
[18:09:24] <password> hmmm?
[18:12:40] <password> I'm really tempted to suggest sublime linter though one of the devs dont' use sublime
[18:13:09] <Akronymus> `(define fold (lambda (state funct seq) (cond ((null? seq) state) (t (fold (funct state (car seq)) funct (cdr seq))))))`
[18:13:18] <Akronymus> fold is EASY.
[18:13:29] <Akronymus> At least as a naive implementation.

[23:13:14] <deniska> mrig: the problem with patents is that you don't have to touch it to violate them
[23:13:19] <mrig> It is always owned by unscrupulous people.
[23:13:28] <deniska> but I'd guess there's plenty of prior art to make this one fairly dubious

[23:15:11] <Donitz> and private people won't get permits
[23:15:18] <Donitz> and it needs to be for a charity of some kind, not for own profit
[23:15:21] <Donitz> as far as I understood
[23:16:10] <deniska> Donitz: are you sure the legislation you're reading into isn't specific to charity foundraising?
[23:16:10] <CoJaBo> Donitz: Can private people sell "things" online?
[23:16:16] <Donitz> yes
[23:16:18] <Donitz> selling is fine
[23:16:20] <Donitz> as long as you pay tax
[23:16:24] <CoJaBo> Donitz: Then sell something trivial :P

[23:16:56] <CoJaBo> Donitz: Support my project by buying a star to appear next to your username in the Supporters List and/or Forum!
[23:16:56] <deniska> Donitz: check with a lawyer, but I believe if you pay taxes off your donate button, you won't have any problems with the gov't :)

[23:17:14] <deniska> Donitz: don't call it "donate" call it "sponsor" :)
[23:17:22] <Donitz> "We have a law called "Money Collection act", which states that to gather donations (i.e. payments with nothing in return), you have to get a permit. This permit costs money, is not given to individuals, and is given only for non-profit activities."
[23:17:36] <pyzozord> in raspberry pi, there is that 40 gpio bus, can I control voltage on individual pins?
[23:17:53] <Donitz> you can control voltage on analog pins
[23:18:01] <Donitz> wait
[23:18:07] <Donitz> does pi even have analog pins
[23:18:11] <CoJaBo> Donitz: Yeh, It sounds like the nothing-in-return bit is the problematic part. Just have all options give some trivial exchange lol

[23:19:16] <Donitz> I don't want to sell anything
[23:19:28] <CoJaBo> Or you could do it manually or programattically if there's a way to view who "donated" :P
[23:19:58] <Donitz> if patents dissapeared tomorrow, everything in the world would be better
[23:20:14] <Donitz> have you browsed google patents?
[23:20:19] <CoJaBo> Donitz: If it's games, have a "Supporter" version of the game with a slightly different logo saying it's for supporters or something
[23:20:19] <Donitz> It's mental
[23:20:27] <CoJaBo> Donitz: There's a zillion ways to do it lol
[23:20:30] <GeDaMo> I am not a fan of the patent system
[23:20:35] <Donitz> and the mere act of browsing patents makes you liable for more damages if sued
[23:20:37] <Donitz> hahaha
[23:20:41] <Donitz> it's so broken
[23:20:48] <GeDaMo> Pay to get your name in the credits roll
[23:20:55] <deniska> In modern world the patent system is… weird.
[23:21:07] <deniska> It doesn't make sense to get a patent for an invention you genuinly care about
[23:21:17] <Donitz> so I implemented gradient descent inverse kinematics
[23:21:17] <mrig> in the world of data structures it is utterly ridiculous.
[23:21:22] <Donitz> an extremely well known method of doing IK
[23:21:30] <Donitz> then stupidly looked it up on google patents
[23:21:33] <deniska> But if you can come up and file 5000 patents, it's really benefitial for your business
[23:21:38] <Donitz> and of course, like literally anything you could imagine, there was a patent for it
[23:21:43] <Donitz> so now I'm too anxious to use it
[23:21:48] <Donitz> screw patents
[23:22:32] <GeDaMo> The patent system is just a weapon big companies use to attack each other
