[23:00:34] <NeilRG> oh wow lots of sed users
[23:00:49] <NeilRG> how do I use sed to strip out everything after a space?
[23:01:27] <NeilRG> is s/\(.*\)\{0,1\}\( .*\)/\1/p the easiest way?
[23:02:39] <NeilRG> doesn't seem to work
[23:03:24] <geirha> s/ .*//
[23:03:25] <curdlesnoot> # echo 'foo bar baz' | sed -e 's/[[:space:]].*//'
[23:03:27] <shbot> curdlesnoot: foo
[23:03:59] <curdlesnoot> or what geirha said if you're only concerned with the ASCII space.
[23:05:30] <NeilRG> curdlesnoot, thanks!!
[23:06:00] *** Quits: simbioz (~simbioz@user/simbioz) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:07:14] <NeilRG> why does the script I'm editing do "sed -n "s/Path:\ *\(.*\)/\1/p"?
[23:07:21] *** Joins: simbioz (~simbioz@user/simbioz)
[23:07:24] <NeilRG> -n suppresses printing the pattern space, and /p prints it?
[23:07:27] <NeilRG> seems conflicting
[23:08:09] <NeilRG> also how do I make it so that if there is no space, sed just outputs the string unchanged?
[23:08:10] <earnestly> NeilRG: -n suppresses printing the rest
[23:08:13] <NeilRG> do I use \{0,1\}?
[23:08:31] <NeilRG> and /p?
[23:08:39] <earnestly> To print only that pattern space
[23:09:18] <NeilRG> I'm so lost, sorry
[23:09:34] <NeilRG> how do I turn "abc def" -> "abc" and also turn "abc" -> "abc"?
[23:10:19] <curdlesnoot> abc to abc. hmm?
[23:10:32] <NeilRG> yes in other words, I want sed to do nothing if there is no space
[23:10:38] <curdlesnoot> oh
[23:10:38] <NeilRG> but if there is one, strip everythign after it
[23:10:40] <NeilRG> including the space
[23:10:53] <curdlesnoot> same answer.
[23:11:03] <geirha> sed -n 's/ .*//p'
[23:11:22] <NeilRG> like if this were python, it would be something like x if ' ' not in x else x[:x.index(' ')]
[23:11:39] <NeilRG> hmm, I tried it, i'll try again
[23:11:40] <curdlesnoot> "abc" can't match / .*//, by definition
[23:11:42] <NeilRG> maybe user error
[23:11:46] <geirha> then sed 's/ .*//'
[23:11:57] <earnestly> curdlesnoot: It doesn't have to
[23:12:02] <earnestly> Oh you mean that
[23:12:06] <curdlesnoot> earnestly: yes, sir
[23:12:09] <geirha> # printf 'abc def\nabc\n' | sed 's/ .*//'
[23:12:11] <shbot> geirha: abc
[23:12:11] <shbot> geirha: abc
[23:12:53] <curdlesnoot> ergo, same answer.
[23:13:05] <NeilRG> oh, sorry, I was doing -n
[23:13:16] <NeilRG> do I want a p on the end or not?
[23:13:30] <geirha> not
[23:13:33] <NeilRG> lol okay
[23:13:39] <NeilRG> thanks
[23:13:41] <earnestly> It's implicit without -n
[23:13:46] <NeilRG> sed is like the elite hacker language for usre
[23:14:14] <earnestly> NeilRG: A better intro is: https://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Sed.html
[23:14:24] <NeilRG> earnestly, thanks
[23:14:40] <NeilRG> I use sed once a year maybe :)
[23:14:52] <NeilRG> just want to fix this zsh plugin
[23:15:11] <earnestly> zsh probably can do what sed is doing, but without having to fork sed to do it
[23:16:51] <NeilRG> earnestly, I bet, but zsh is even more cryptic imho
[23:17:32] <earnestly> Yep

[23:25:41] <ormaaj> I don't get the appeal of a perl-esque giant bag of weird-ass features that is zsh.
[23:27:12] <earnestly> It makes for a nice interactive shell
