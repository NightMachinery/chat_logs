[01:08:12] <Guest8574> in example, the famous and well promoted microwave oven does not make huge radiation over you??
[01:08:39] <ayecee> i sure hope not.

[02:12:49] <Guest8574> as far as I could research, it is its special blue light frequency which is harmful together with its intensity; apart from being also the white light bad for night ambiences (not a natural color for night then the body can't get prepared to sleep)
[02:12:53] <kuhilas> or at least won't vote him if that helps
[02:13:02] <matsaman> I mean if we can turn off people's tiktok instead of nuking the world, that sounds ridiculous but still like progress
[02:13:19] <moo> apparently onlyfans banned all belarusan and russian models, and they also can't payout
[02:13:38] <Guest8574> the blue light is supposed for the day and the yellow/orange for the night (or few light/darkness directly)
[02:13:43] <matsaman> Guest8574: you can get LEDs that don't use blue light
[02:13:44] <xx> right, just how germans became mad at germany for causing ww1 and thus having to suffer extreme reparations... When in reality they just blamed the other countries, not their own country.

[05:17:07] <Lebela> what's the best practice when it comes to fixing a video with many brightness changes?
[05:17:42] <Lebela> the camera has decided on its own to make the video brighter / darker for no reason, and that for many times
[05:18:02] <Lebela> I considered splitting the video into multiple parts and using ffmpeg then
[05:18:20] <Lebela> but the color changes happen so often

[06:33:02] <wroathe> Is there a trick to getting the gtk inspector to appear? My understanding is that when I press ctrl+shift+I on any window it should appear if the appropriate gsetting is configured, right?
[06:33:20] <wroathe> gnome 41 apparently uses gtk4, which says it's got the gsetting for this enabled by default

[08:08:34] <Dagmar> Be certain your user's newly-replaced homedir is _still owned by them_
[08:08:40] <forthewin> so can I do sudo mount /dev/sdb1/mnt /home/  ?
[08:08:51] <Dagmar> ...otherwise you may no longer be able to login when you do that until you fix it as root
[08:08:57] <Dagmar> No, you can't
[08:09:07] <labrador> Dagmar, wait why would that happen?
[08:09:27] <Dagmar> Because one of the more common restrictions on accounts is that the homedir must exist and it must by owned by the user.
[08:09:35] <labrador> oh ok
[08:09:39] <Dagmar> Also, sshd will basically tell you to bugger off if your homedir isn't owned by you
[08:09:49] <forthewin> how do I make sure I still own it?

[08:10:34] <Guest15> recently, I realized that I could curl to a unix socket and it would make replies as if it were a web server. I really like that idea of serving things on a socket, rather than a port. Could someone point me to the right direction regarding how I can create my own simple web service running on a socket?

[08:56:50] <Mystified1234> remember for non tech savy
[08:56:59] <MeanEYE> kronk, could it be that your partition table got messed up?
[08:57:29] <kronk> MeanEYE: this was an SSD that just quit today. and by quit, I mean refused to read around ~13+ gigabytes worth of information off of a 150gig disk.

[09:04:12] *** not_phunyguy is now known as phunyguy
[09:04:16] <kronk> like, /dev/sda1 was the EFI partition, /dev/sda2 was swap (stupid me,I know), /dev/sda3 was the actual data.
[09:04:34] <MeanEYE> kronk, does fdisk see them?
[09:04:36] <kronk> yeah what pnbeast said. I backed up every other drive image except the one I use every day. don't be an idiot like me.
[09:04:53] <kronk> MeanEYE: if I run fdisk on the image file? nope.
[09:05:03] <MeanEYE> How did you generate the image?
[09:05:26] <kronk> ddrescue -n /dev/sda3 ./drive.img recovery.map
[09:05:39] <MeanEYE> Hm, am not sure what kind of images that makes.
[09:05:50] <kronk> a partial dump of a whole drive. :\
[09:05:56] <kronk> just the final partition.
[09:06:20] <kronk> I still have the drive and if coerced it could respond to some queries or reads (barely).
[09:06:45] <MeanEYE> So, fdisk won't find anything because you dumped only partition, no partition table.
[09:06:50] <kronk> yup.
[09:07:02] <MeanEYE> ext3?
[09:07:04] <kronk> ext4.
[09:07:24] <MeanEYE> And what does dry run of fsck say?
[09:07:38] <kronk> gives me a lovely "Your superblock is corrupted. Abort?"
[09:07:45] <kronk> and then says to delete all sorts of inode information.

[20:23:33] <Guest4896> until he got with the long command
[20:23:42] <hexnewbie> There is stupid software out there like LibreOffice that differentiates empty and unset variables (and the “unofficial bash strict mode”, but that makes more sense)
[20:23:47] <Dagmar> ...which is why they really don't need to "learn" that people online don't know any more than they do.
[20:24:32] <Dagmar> ...because it's really, really irritating when someone asks for assistance and then wants to argue about the bloody solution
[20:24:56] <labrador> hexnewbie, java does that too

[20:25:24] <hexnewbie> labrador: Well, Java is a language, that's acceptable.
[20:25:25] <Dagmar> Lots of languages have an understanding of the difference between an empty string and undef.  Just like _math_ knows the difference

[20:36:49] <msiism> I see.
[20:37:02] <Guest4896> trying to solve the mistery... since I am not experienced with "export"... is it good to use a command (like "dare") in a exported variable?

[23:54:32] <ananke> though frankly, 'C', 'GUI' development, and 'beginner friendly' seem like an oxymoron
[23:54:59] <ananke> ConCarne: so is C. are you sure you want to use that as your language?
[23:55:01] <uwharrie> Is C a hard requirement?

[23:56:02] <uwharrie> if you want something to get going quickly, I'd say look into Tk and your preference out of TCL, Perl, Python, etc
[23:56:02] <ConCarne> ananke: I agree.. but my college starts "intro to programming" with C so I have only learned that.

[23:57:32] <ConCarne> honestly C seemed a lot easier even the advanced topics.. but GTK kinda scared me

[23:58:15] <ananke> ConCarne: what's the end goal here?
[23:58:19] <uwharrie> GTK is a bit of an anti-pattern when it comes to C, using lots of compiler macros and type casting to provide an OOP-like experience

[23:58:42] <jim> ConCarne, so you've done some C stuff, have you done any of these other languages?
