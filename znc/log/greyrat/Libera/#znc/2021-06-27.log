[02:58:48] <KarlJoad> I am getting this error "error:1408F10B:SSL routines:ssl3_get_record:wrong version number" when connecting to my ZNC server from Emacs' erc-tls
[02:58:52] <KarlJoad> Any advice?
[03:07:31] <DarthGandalf> wrong port?
[03:10:33] <KarlJoad> systemctl states that znc is bound to port 5000, which I am connecting to.
[03:11:13] <KarlJoad> When I use erc-tls, I can get to a control buffer for the server _only_ when I do not provide a password.

[03:16:08] <kour1er> well i have to track down what's doing it - my first thought is the auto rename thing... but not sure why it would switch to the alternate nick... i will prod software and see what i can find. sorry for the irritation
