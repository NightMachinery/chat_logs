[00:30:15] <ProfSimm> GeDaMo: so contracts are a fancy name of asserts
[00:31:30] <ProfSimm> pyzozord: depends, some contracts you can express via types. Many you can't. Say like "give me a string which matches this regex"
[00:31:54] <bjs> ProfSimm: there's a very grey line between assertions and contracts and types
[00:32:04] <ProfSimm> Very grey.
[00:32:11] <ProfSimm> I wanna have no line at all
[00:32:16] <bjs> Then go ahead
[00:32:35] <pyzozord> ProfSimm: Actually in typescript they now have something like regex for types
[00:32:43] <bjs> But a type system that is powerful enough to encode whatever assertions you want is not decidable, so you can't write a nice typechecker for it
[00:32:47] <ProfSimm> bjs The question is if I make a function that accepts arbitrary arguments and validates them with assertions, how would the caller even know what to send
[00:32:48] <bjs> so you have to make trade-offs
[00:33:13] <pyzozord> ProfSimm: in Ada you can specify a range of valid values on an integer type
[00:33:46] <bjs> ProfSimm: well assertions and contracts are there to check/enforce the programmer sent the right thing,  if they want to know what they *should* send in they need to read the documentation or the signature or something derived from the assertions/types/contracts that tells them what the function expects

[00:34:30] <ProfSimm> What now*
[00:34:43] <bjs> this is no different to normal type signatures, the type checker at its core just says "no" it's all the extra fluff like helpful error messages and line numbers and autocomplete and signatures into docs and things are there to make it usable by the programmer

[00:34:46] <bayaz> Title: Tcl Library Source Code: Documentation 
[00:34:55] <pyzozord> ProfSimm: you can for example annotate the function and at the caller use reflection to figure that data out
[00:34:56] <bjs> and you can do all the same things mostly for whatever system you choose
[00:35:10] <pyzozord> but that is then essentially a poor runtime type system that you just reimplemented
[00:35:30] <ProfSimm> My problem is basically GUI
[00:36:13] <bjs> ProfSimm: well imagine doing it for some function with types,  you can look at the types and then have something that generates a form for that function
[00:36:20] <ProfSimm> A function could have a distinct interface "describe" which spits out a specification of its input and output
[00:36:35] <bjs> for simple types at least, a text box for a string, a check box for a bool etc, and you can read the signature programatically
[00:36:53] <GeDaMo> Type inference perhaps
[00:36:55] <ProfSimm> bjs: what about a select box with 10 entries, and those entries depend on runtime state in the functin
[00:37:29] <bjs> ProfSimm: well it can't depend on the state *in* the function because your webform is something you create and then submit beore the function even runs, no?
[00:38:06] <bjs> Or what you mean is like, the values acceptable for one argument depends on the value of another?
[00:38:29] <ProfSimm> bjs: the environment in this case is like SmallTalk, it's always running. The function exists. But I wanna have a form before I make the function do the thing that the input is supposed to make it do
[00:39:00] <pyzozord> reflection
[00:39:13] <ProfSimm> Well reflection reads static data
[00:39:16] <bjs> ProfSimm: I mean I'm not sure what part of the problem you're trying to solve here
[00:39:22] <ProfSimm> This is a select box of 10 items
[00:39:45] <bjs> If your code has all the data in it you need,  either as assertions or are type signatures or as contracts then you can just read those and build up an idea of what the function does

[00:40:47] <ProfSimm> bjs: you instantiate an object:   new EtchWithLaser('a', 'b', 'c', ....);  Now you wanna make a form for this object. It takes ONE of the strings you passed to the constructor. And etches it with a laser on an iPhone and sends it to you
[00:41:05] <ProfSimm> bjs: you wanna have the form before any etching occurs
[00:41:14] <pyzozord> you can read static information about the function from reflection and you can hydrate that with normal runtime data, and that's all data you ever need
[00:41:40] <bjs> ProfSimm: I mean I'm not sure what the problem is you're trying to solve here,  if you read the code then it contains all the data and all the assertions and all the control and data flow so you can see what's going on
[00:41:49] <ProfSimm> pyzozord: in my example the strings are defined at runtime from the constructor
[00:42:13] <ProfSimm> bjs: no, the strings 'a', 'b' and so on are not in the EtchWithLaser class
[00:42:21] <ProfSimm> They're runtime args
[00:42:22] <bjs> No they're part of the constructor call, sure
[00:42:31] <bjs> ProfSimm: I still don't get what the problem is, or what you're trying to solve
[00:42:35] <pyzozord> ProfSimm: actually they are compile time if they are passed as literals
[00:42:55] <ProfSimm> pyzozord: the assumption is they're not passed as literals.
[00:42:56] <pyzozord> but if they were variables then you just need to ask the object for it's data, like in normal programming
[00:43:27] <pyzozord> etch.giveYourStringsPls()

[00:44:19] <ProfSimm> I don't want people to have to write this manually.
[00:44:26] <pyzozord> btw reflection is also for runtime information
[00:44:29] <bjs> ProfSimm: I mean it's not hard to imagine some function or whatever that reads the source code and understands the assertions/types/whatever and the data/control flow and combines that with any runtime info (variables etc) to produce some usable artefact
[00:44:48] <pyzozord> so if you have a good enough reflection system you'd beable to get the values for private fields of an object too
[00:44:54] <bjs> ProfSimm: but the problem is not doing this at all, but restricting it down to a useful, usable but implementable subset of behaviours
[00:44:57] <ProfSimm> bjs: it's not hard to imagine it. It gets hard only when you try to implement it
[00:45:25] <bjs> ProfSimm: well it depends, like I said earlier the example of "look at type signature, make text box for strings, check box for booleans and then make submit run the function" etc
[00:45:53] <bjs> is not hard to imagine or implement.  What you describe is kind of fluffy and hard to define exactly what you want,  so it's hard to know what the implementation would look like
[00:46:23] <bjs> except to say that it is clear that this cannot be some arbitrary relationship, i.e. any old asserts

[03:53:16] <nihtsunnu> also not having to think about overflows or underflows
[03:54:55] <nihtsunnu> a language like algol is sufficient to describe programs for von neuman devices, and further you get a language like c that is much less complex which is something chip makers want
[03:56:05] <nihtsunnu> I would be interested in seeing someone make use of all the mistakes made in the past to make a new abi, that would be interesting
[03:58:07] <nihtsunnu> slightly related, I did see a presentation where someone's solution was to make a new system language (to program small devices) that outputs safe c code, that seemed to work well for them

[04:11:36] <vdamewood> adder`: Is there more context that I missed or is that a stand-alone request?
[04:12:00] <nihtsunnu> "An ABI defines how data structures or computational routines are accessed in machine code, which is a low-level, hardware-dependent format."
[04:12:03] <adder`> vdamewood, they mentioned ABI earlier but the questions stands alone
[04:12:18] <adder`> s/questions/question/
[04:12:56] <vdamewood> adder`: So, there are two separate, but related concepts called 'ABI', one is the specification for how bits of code interact with each other (in machine code), and the other his how that specification is applied to a specific library.
[04:13:24] *** Joins: optic__ (~rickybob@gateway/vpn/pia/rickybob)
[04:14:05] <vdamewood> adder`: So, for the first, when you call a function in C, what happens in machine code? There is no 'call function' instruction in machine code, there's a 'call' instruction, usually, but all that does is save the memory address you're at, and move to another place. But how do you handle the arguments? What about return values? the ABI specifies these.

[04:17:01] <vdamewood> adder`: The other kind, refers to how the interface for a Library is exposed, in machine code, to client programs. Changes to the source code might change the ABI and if so, the changed version won't be compatible with consumers of the old version.

[04:18:08] <vdamewood> adder`: For example, if I have a library with a function: int get_foo(int), and I build a program that uses int get_foo(int). This program will crash if I use a different version of the library with int get_foo(int, int);
[04:18:41] <adder`> gotcha
[04:19:39] <vdamewood> adder`: An additional part of ASBI in C++ includes name mangling, where the compiler changes the name of the function that exists in the final binary, from the name it has in source.

[04:22:18] <vdamewood> Though, there are two ways that have been developed to get around the problem with name mangling. Using a C ABI with extern "C", and using Microsoft's COM.

[04:29:44] <vdamewood> nomagno: Nope. for the most part it's something like what you did.
[04:30:11] <junebug> You could make a method which takes in a value T and the implementation can decide if it's a float or an integer. Or you can use a super type of both integer and float and do your abs on that
[04:30:31] <vdamewood> Usually it ends up being something more like __fAbsoluteValue__I and __fAbsoluteValue__F

[04:33:00] <vdamewood> So, they aren't sub types of a common super type.
[04:33:39] <vdamewood> nomagno: The name mangling covers types too, including user-defined classes.
[04:34:12] <nomagno> jazzy: It's an NP-Hard problem
[04:34:16] <vdamewood> In what I've seen, it's been __ followed by the name space of the class, followed by the class name itself
[04:34:20] <nomagno> You're looking at brute force transversing algorithms
[04:34:35] <vdamewood> Foo::Bar::MyClass converts to something like __Foo__Bar__MyClass
[04:34:54] <vdamewood> maybe __nfoo__nBar__cMyClass

[04:35:51] <jazzy> nomagno, I guess a better question would be, how do I go about finding the shortest path within max k steps
[04:36:35] <jazzy> would be easy without cycles, I'd just do a regular bfs and be done with it
[04:36:57] <junebug> nihtsunnu, How would you find the prime factors of a number by hand?

[04:37:49] <vdamewood> nihtsunnu: guess?
[04:38:10] <nihtsunnu> yeah, try x * y * z == n
[04:38:22] <nihtsunnu> if yes then done, otherwise repeat
[04:38:22] <vdamewood> nihtsunnu: Actually there's a better way.
[04:38:28] <nomagno> I mean, you know thisittke insignificant mathematical problem PvNP?
[04:38:44] <nomagno> We know it's extremely inefficient to factorize numbers, but don't know if the only solution is bruteforce
[04:38:54] <vdamewood> nihtsunnu: You can break a number into factors, then break the factors into factors, and so on. Ultimately you will get the prime factors.
[04:38:59] <junebug> nihtsunnu, you can use modulo and the sieve
[04:39:21] *** Joins: boof (~rickybob@gateway/vpn/pia/rickybob)
[04:39:23] <vdamewood> nihtsunnu: For example, you can break 20 into 5 and 4. 5 doesn't break down more, but 4 is 2*2, thus, the prim factors fo 20 are 2*2*5
[04:39:32] <nihtsunnu> vdamewood breaking numbers into factors sounds like a bad idea for large numbers

[04:40:39] <nihtsunnu> ok, I guess if I know a couple primes that will make it easier
[04:41:06] <nihtsunnu> but I guess the terrible case is if the number itself is a prime
[04:41:12] <vdamewood> Every positive integer comprises a unique list of prime factors.
[04:42:01] <vdamewood> nihtsunnu: Here's another thing about composite numbers, if a number is composite, then it will have at least one factor, prime or not, less than or equal to its square.
[04:42:12] <junebug> You can go through each prime in order and modulo the number. If it's divisible that prime save the prime and divide the number by it. Now take the result of the division and continue going through the primes
[04:42:56] <nihtsunnu> makes sense

[04:44:25] <vdamewood> Also, if you have two numbers m, and n that multiply to get another value p, such that m*n=p, then the prime factors of p are the prime factors of n, and the prime factors of m.

[11:09:35] <Decker> hmm I haven't tested this with touch.. the tab does change mouse mode between lock/unlocked mode; and swaps which control function is run; but maybe these don't have good touch?  I had a loader that workd in webVR and AltSpace's VR environment too

[12:13:28] <amigojapan> licksjp_:エミュレーターなの？
[12:13:29] <TheRedRipper> thanks amigojapan 
[12:13:33] <pyzozord> I just read recently an article explaining why japanese web design seems so nodig to the western eye. Their brains are used to much more condensed visual information because of their letters. And for us it seems noisy because it's just jam packed with information. Also their language doesn't allow for formatting like italics or bolded font so the graphics makes up for it with contracting colors
[12:13:57] <pyzozord> Nodig=noisy
[12:14:05] <licksjp_> ＭＳＸはエミュレータがあります
[12:14:26] <amigojapan> あah gotcha Raziel, I am even unsure if this may be an emulator, he talks about making  a rom for it
[12:15:36] <GeDaMo> Some emulators use files which contain the equivalent of a ROM
[12:15:54] <amigojapan> licksjp_: windows用ソフトですか？
[12:15:58] <GeDaMo> ROM is just a block of memory anyway
[12:16:21] <licksjp_> amigojapan: どれのことですか？

[12:16:49] <amigojapan> licksjp_: BASIC for android
[12:16:58] <pyzozord> I thought it was cool because that means their books are much lighter than hours and and their reading is much higher bandwidth resulting with getting the same amount of information much faster

[20:06:22] <KillerWasp> That's it, it's over, there were still many things he wanted to do in his life, but now it was totally cut short, all the time he had left was fleeting and totally decided by the fine poisonous stinger in his neck that the monster suspended, he couldn't moving, not even speaking, meant moving and causing a lethal piercing, the seconds he was gaining was just because of the playful monster. This feeling so finely close to death was so 
[20:06:22] <KillerWasp> horrible and heavy that he wanted to die once and for all so that it would end immediately, he desperately wanted to gesture a last word to his companions, but he couldn't, his stupid survival instinct prevented him, his brain was being torn apart by the colossal terror of death, little by little, crumbling like flour falling to the bottom of water. His life changed forever from this point, he was practically dead no matter what happened next.
[20:06:38] <KillerWasp> mmmm, something large, sorry.

[21:20:33] <Rounin> Sometimes I wonder at how difficult they've made dependency handling in Java... After all, there are packages specified in the source files... But then they've made Maven packages on top of that... And then since Java 9 or so, they've had modules on top of that... What are they even smoking
[21:21:01] <GeDaMo> Job security, baby! :P
[21:21:08] <Rounin> jamea: But OK, so you've got your settings.xml... One thing you might want to do is to check the URL it's using and see that there are still packages at that URL
[21:21:22] <Rounin> Perhaps you have to change the URL to something slightly different... maven.org instead of apache.org or something like that

[22:50:15] <pyzozord> ProfSimm: yes being self sufficient in case of societal catasrophy is a good idea. Ideally I'd like to produce my own potatoes and chicken and some veggies enough to keep surviving. In good years I can earn money and buy fancy stuff, in bad years, or in really really bad years I don't have to
[22:51:12] <ProfSimm> pyzozord: being self-sufficient is a tall order. I think the best we can do is have "buffers" when supply channels break down and there are temporary crises.
[22:51:16] <pyzozord> meaning I think I want to be able to survive without modern infrastructure and technology in case it mallfunctions or even collapses. And on that solid independent base I can add on things that are depending but are not themselves essential
[22:52:09] <pyzozord> which generally makes me appear relatively "normal" from the perspective of the society but doesn't make my survival dependent on that society

[23:50:45] <nomagno> Communication and payment and computing are basic services. First world problem haha and all you want but you wouldn't want that to happen to you would you?
[23:50:45] <flakland> people are dying in yemen too
[23:50:52] <flakland> all over the place
[23:51:00] <epony> quickly steal their grain
[23:51:12] <KillerWasp> The part that worries me the most is obviously the profits. If I made it open source it would be entirely possible that all kinds of different frontend projects would appear with my dynamic code. But I earn absolutely nothing, it's not what I'm expecting from my projects.
[23:51:17] <nomagno> Putin could be the hecking devil, and I still l wouldn't accept cutting services people depend on
[23:51:32] <perro> they went to far
[23:51:36] <ProfSimm> nomagno: propose a solution
[23:51:39] <TheLinuxNerd> nomagno, agreed, Disney is not the problem, Mastercard/VISA is the issue
[23:51:42] <nomagno> KillerWasp: who says you can't earn anythig? Support, hosting, proprietary forks...
[23:51:43] <flakland> is tigray/etheopia war still hapenning too?
[23:51:45] <epony> what services, Apple warranty or iOS updates?
[23:51:51] <epony> muahahahaha
[23:51:54] <nomagno> ProfSimm: if I had one I wouldn't be complaining here!
[23:52:15] <ProfSimm> Apple has not blocked software services in Russia
[23:52:18] <ProfSimm> Just sales of new products
[23:52:23] <epony> who cares ;-)
[23:52:27] <KillerWasp> nomagno: All that you mention are costs.
[23:52:30] <TheLinuxNerd> and China doth rejoice!
[23:52:32] <o|||||o> nobody around to help, i suppose
[23:52:38] <o|||||o> looking elsewhere
[23:52:45] <TheLinuxNerd> cause with no new Apple hardware, they'll buy Chinese phones ...
[23:52:48] <nomagno> I would be pulling off a Greta Thunberg at the EU Parliament's door
[23:52:49] <nomagno> Probably
[23:53:03] <epony> the rumours of any Apple sales in Eastern Europe are highly over-estimated..
[23:53:19] <nomagno> o|||||o hey have a bit of patience! You're not gonna be waiting two hours I assure you
[23:53:24] <nomagno> You can ask elsewhere too tho
[23:53:25] <ProfSimm> nomagno: Russians have to choose if they want to be second North Korea
[23:53:27] <bnchs> o|||||o, what is your name supposed to be
[23:53:34] <nomagno> Lemme look at your questiob

[23:53:47] <TheLinuxNerd> :-D Red Star, get it
[23:54:00] <epony> ProfSimm, you're confusing orders of magnitude, though, which is a bad indication for programmability
[23:54:02] <oldlaptop> Hey, I've got a great idea: Maybe we could start a computer programming IRC channel, for discussing computer programming.
[23:54:08] <psydroid> iPhones perhaps?
[23:54:16] <TheLinuxNerd> oldlaptop, nah,  just take over ##politics
[23:54:17] <nomagno> I'm not feeling like PMing anyone, sorry
[23:54:20] <bnchs> oldlaptop, don't we have that already at #c
[23:54:47] <o|||||o> nomagno, i only asked for pm because my question kept getting buried
[23:55:00] <TheLinuxNerd> ProfSimm, solution to the World is Mahatma Gandhi's non-violence
[23:55:02] <nomagno> Oh, well report the question pls

[23:56:46] <nomagno> I understand SIMD now, found a basic example
[23:56:47] <KillerWasp> Putin Star OS 4 can be selling very much.
[23:56:53] <KillerWasp> good idea.
[23:56:56] <nomagno> Now to tackle MISD
[23:57:27] <nomagno> Hm... Oh I understand everything now, surprisingly!
[23:57:51] <KillerWasp> i guess is better make a fork of archlinux for make any other distro or OS.
[23:58:08] <nomagno> SISD executes one instruction at a time. SIMD can mash together similar operations onto one instruction which would otherwise require multiple instructions
[23:58:19] <ProfSimm> nomagno: event sourcing is one example that relies on MISD extensively
[23:58:23] <nomagno> MISD can chop up one stream of data into pieces and each instruction stream takes care of it
[23:58:24] <KillerWasp> and who know, maybe end very high like redhat.
[23:58:33] <nomagno> MIMD is... Well both
[23:58:48] <ProfSimm> nomagno: I think you described SIMD again
[23:58:58] <nomagno> Ah... Yeah SIMD seems like the easiest to use
[23:59:20] <ProfSimm> SIMD is basically array operations. Like [1, 2, 3] + 10 = [11, 12, 13]
[23:59:22] <epony> check the "diagram comparing classifications", it has pictures  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn's_taxonomy#Diagram_comparing_classifications
[23:59:22] <bayaz> Title: Flynn's taxonomy - Wikipedia 
[23:59:29] <nomagno> Yeah
[23:59:48] <ProfSimm> nomagno: do you know how read models work in event sources architectures
[23:59:49] <nomagno> epony: those pictures aren't helpful in understanding practical functioning
