[00:37:51] <kenran> I've tried bisecting my org config but no luck. Starting emacs -q and manually setting org-hide-emphasis-markers seems to work fine, though.
[00:38:43] <wgreenhouse> kenran: org is good at ending up in mixed states where installations don't quite work. emacs -q gives you builtin org
[00:38:55] <wgreenhouse> I suspect it's that; evil is likely a red herring

[03:57:50] <bpalmer> Let's add technology to automatically switch between dark and light themes.
[03:58:31] <wgreenhouse> > delta chat seems a bit like exwm in the "yeah I could see that technically being possible but there's no way it's actually feasible, right? right???"
[03:58:32] <wgreenhouse> technomancy: but you use exwm and it's great ;)
[03:59:29] <technomancy> wgreenhouse: yeah! makes me want to try delta chat.
[03:59:33] <technomancy> it's so crazy it might work
[03:59:43] <technomancy> problem is network effects are a big deal with chat and not at all with a WM
[04:00:52] <wgreenhouse> technomancy: its network includes all email users; that's one of their talking points
[04:01:06] <wgreenhouse> it's mostly just a MUA with a really weird UI
[04:01:11] <JordiGH> bpalmer: That reminds me, do you know of luminance and how each of the RGB colours contributes separately to it?

[04:04:27] <bpalmer> No, no, I understand Monty Hall now. I still get upset about the one with two children.
[04:04:29] <JordiGH> Do you think the door you originally opened is still equally likely to have the goat?
[04:04:32] <technomancy> rudybot: damn right let's talk about the goat
[04:04:50] <mange> I've tried using DeltaChat for email, and it doesn't place nicely with subject lines. From memory, sending a message just uses the subject line of the most recently recieved message from that contact, or something like that. It gets complicated with group chats and stuff. Bit of a shame.
[04:04:59] <rudybot> technomancy: damn tho, did not rly expect there'd be talk of goat theft and religious polemics in #emacs

[09:07:08] <bpalmer> hyiltiz: by default, elisp is dynamically scoped.
[09:07:21] <bpalmer> although more and more contexts are shifting towards lexically scoped.
[09:07:49] <bpalmer> If you set a variable that is not previously let bound, even in lexically scoped things, it probably creates it as a dynamic global
[09:08:38] <bpalmer> (I should test for my own curiosity at least but busy doing something else at the moment)
[09:10:33] <hyiltiz> Gotcha, thanks! That clears up a some confusion (coming from haskell, I am trying to find a subset of elisp that I can treat as pure)

[09:18:12] <bpalmer> hyiltiz: always make sure that your variables are declared, is the big rule of thumb. If they're global, use defvar , and be aware that they'll always be dynamically scoped.
[09:18:53] <bpalmer> Use let if you're making local changes -- if you're in dynamic scope, that means you only affect the dynamic bindings, and if you're in lexical scope, you are explicitly outlining the scope it should be in.

[16:09:34] <wasamasa> you're not setting PATH correctly
[16:10:29] <wasamasa> you've most likely set it in your .bashrc and promptly forgot that there are other programs than bash which might profit from extending PATH
[16:10:30] <blacked> isnt it `export PATH=...` in ~/.zshrc and done, what else, isnt it correct , i can run it through terminal
[16:10:45] <wasamasa> as you realized, it only works in the terminal

[16:53:32] <wasamasa> or do you not

[19:11:41] <SylvatiCodes> what about c-basic-offset 4
[19:13:19] <corwin> I think any program can be as "configurable" as Emacs given it puts it's focus on some "fully featured language" and exposes as much of it's general behavior in that layer.  At that point the roots of the internal language are no more important that whatever is used as a "glue layer" (C/rust/etc). But it has to go out of it's way something like that, as Emacs does.
[19:13:33] <SylvatiCodes> https://dpaste.org/HT7r is my c specific config YMMV
[19:13:53] <blacked> guys i was
[19:13:59] <blacked> on hacker news news
[19:14:10] <blacked> `Emacs Lisp is probably the most featureless language you can think of; it doesn't even do basic threading and the async stuff is a joke. All the major programming language modes are implemented as ad-hoc Elisp regexp parsers making bugs impossible to fix. Virtually _everything_ is implemented in Elisp, because the C code is a gigantic
[19:14:11] <blacked> unmaintainable mess. This means that all the pretty high-level stuff like Magit is shit slow. Good features take ages to propagate to upstream, whose reasons are often more political than technical.`

[19:43:27] <corwin> But considering `tab-stop-lists' wants a list of sample values to extrapolate from, as column numbers, the `number-sequence' should be all you need.

Now when i hit RET at the end of an org-mode headline the cursor drops to column 0 of the next line instead of whatever column the indentation should be.

I have it set up as a systemd service that starts when I boot, and whenever I run emacsclient -c I get "Display :1 can't be opened". interestingly I don't get this error if I instead start the service manually after KDE starts, or just run emacs --daemon manually.
