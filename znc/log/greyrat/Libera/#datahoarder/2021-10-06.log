[22:11:46] <cirdan> kokopop: most/all 2tb+ are smr, not great, not terrible. for the money i'd get a 5rb seagate external 2.5
[22:11:49] <cirdan> 5tb
[22:12:46] <cirdan> stay away from WD 2.5" drives they have usb headers on the drive, no way to shuck them and put them in anything later or for disaster recovery
[22:13:46] <kokopop> ive already got a 1TB drive but it's already filled up pretty quick 
[22:14:00] <kokopop> need something for the long term buy most externals seem pretty breakable

[22:16:13] <cirdan> kokopop: the seagates are great unless you smash them

[22:17:22] <kokopop> yea been alot of stuff my brain been telling me to get

[22:18:10] <cirdan> hah
[22:18:24] <cirdan> the panama ones never did yet, right?
[22:18:34] <cirdan> i wanted to grab them but dont think i ever saw them
[22:18:56] <kokopop> yea and the twitch leaks just happened
[22:19:04] <kokopop> so glad i deleted my account a couple months back
[22:21:17] <cirdan> but i run zfs on a single 5tb external it's not bad and i really do like i can scrub and not worry about a forrupt file
[22:21:26] <cirdan> corrupt. it can't fix it for me but at least i'll know
[22:22:15] <kokopop> one of my worst file losses was me losing a usb that had 2 years of journal entries 
[22:22:21] <kokopop> taught me to make sure to back up stuff

[22:25:41] <electrostrong> does anyone have a NetApp DS4246 by chance?
[22:25:47] <electrostrong> that they use for storage
[22:27:45] <electrostrong> I have the disk shelf and it's been running fine with a LSISAS2116 card - I'm trying to figure out how to clear the shelf fault indicator on the front panel...I've read that in the configuration I have (Shelf --> LSI Card) this may not be possible, but I was curious if anyone else figured it out.
[22:30:05] <electrostrong> (most configs use the FAS2040/FAS3240 controllers from what I've seen)
