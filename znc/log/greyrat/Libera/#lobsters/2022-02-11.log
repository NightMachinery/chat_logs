[03:41:52] <bsandro> 90s Motherland wasn't much fun either (or "too much fun"), grew up with that, 0 nostalgia to be honest
[03:42:52] <technomancy> wait are we talking about earthbound again or not; I'm confused
[03:43:15] <rocx> technomancy: i'm as lost as you are.
[03:43:25] <rocx> topics change like a mofo
[03:44:48] <bsandro> my bad
[03:44:48] <technomancy> (the joke is that the Japanese name for earthbound is "mother 2")
[03:45:14] <technomancy> that might have been a stretch
[03:45:33] <rocx> technomancy: where's the joke in that? i've been keeping up with tomato-san's fantranslation of mother 3 and that felt like a stretch.
[03:46:01] <technomancy> "motherland" -> "mother 2" I dunno listen it made sense in my head
[03:46:06] <rocx> oh.
[03:46:35] <rocx> wonder how much of that is a translation issue despite knowing the EB series is the MOTHER series.
[03:46:57] <rocx> we got EB on the switch SNES stuff now so that's a plus

[19:10:46] <elbartus> i am reading lobste.rs for quite a while already, but I don't know any of the users I am reading there, personally... After cold-inquiring two users for an invite on twitter (I got rejected), I was pointed to the chat and now I am here to maybe join some discussions here and potentially get invited at some point ;)

[19:35:21] <elbartus> there seems to be a band with such a name,too wikipedia says. but the creature seems to steam from a read dead mod?

[21:19:17] <pretty_dumm_guy> they provide a web gui file manager
[21:22:34] <tragnos> seems like you could just run a aws gpu instance as needed for less
[21:23:37] <pretty_dumm_guy> is it really that cheap ? I keep seeing articles mentioning that aws gpu instance for v100/p100 is pretty expensive compared to colab pro

[21:27:18] *** Joins: YellowSuB (~YellowSuB@user/yellowsub)
[21:27:21] <pretty_dumm_guy> so for colab pro you can use an instance continuous for 24 hours. For aws, that comes out to be 9,6$
[21:28:27] <pretty_dumm_guy> rocx: it takes much longer to train these neural networks without a gpu
[21:29:17] <tragnos> Probably worth it then. It doesn't sound like you'll get an enormous surprise bill, at least.
[21:31:17] <pretty_dumm_guy> yeap. It appears to be so. I am waiting to talk to one of my friends. Then probably I'll just make the decision
[21:31:30] <tragnos> I don't need it much, but I hook up an external usb-c gpu enclosure up to my laptop as needed. Depending on what you're doing buying the hardware might cheaper in the long run (assuming you can actually get a gpu right now).
