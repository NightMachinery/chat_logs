[15:26:43] <wallbroken> is possible to tell the page: add margins only if the browser lenght is at least x pixels?
[15:36:01] <DPA> There are media queries for the page width
[15:48:41] <DPA> margin: auto; can also sometimes fill up remaining space. And with calc(),  you can do calculations, including min(), max(), etc.
