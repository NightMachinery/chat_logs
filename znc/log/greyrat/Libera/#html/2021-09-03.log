[01:06:33] <rjwiii> I'm creating a table in HTML. In some cases the data is blank for a particular cell and I want to shrink the width of just that one cell but not the other cells in that column. Is there a way to set the width of just 1 cell in a row and not effect the the other cells in the column?
[01:10:46] <rjwiii> In other words, is it possible to have a column with cells of different widths?

[01:21:52] <Visage> rjwiii: No. The column in question will always be as wide as the widest cell. This has always been how tables work.
[01:22:49] <rjwiii> Visage: I'm trying a work around now ... using colspan and &nbsp; ...
[01:23:52] <rjwiii> Thanks for your reply ...

[03:10:19] <bin> Visage: idk because you can define the width of each item with grid but if it's tabular data it should be in a table for semantic purposes. 
[03:10:24] <bin> lantech19446: no prob
[03:11:17] <Visage> bin: Yes, yes it should.
[03:14:30] <bin> right okay so it could work then

[10:39:24] <^PAL_man^> the vids are hosted on said website too btw
[10:47:17] <Pilum> Certainly not with HTML. You'll probably need some serverside solution. #web for general questions.
