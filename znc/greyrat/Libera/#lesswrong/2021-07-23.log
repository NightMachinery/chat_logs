[03:37:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> "We are willing to cooperate on a compromise, but GNOME does not want to entertain the discussion and would rather push disingenuous propaganda for their cause. The topic of the #wayland channel on Freenode includes the statement “Please do not argue about server-side vs. client-side decorations. It’s settled and won’t change.” I have been banned from this channel for over a year because I persistently called for
[03:37:49] <Obormot\Arcturus>  compromise." ... ah, open source communities
[03:38:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> The spirit of collaboration!
[03:39:05] <catern> if you only want there to be one way to make decorations, "compromising" with someone who wants multiple is kind of just giving up... 
[03:39:25] <gwern> server vs client does sound like one of those 'the middle way is the worst of both worlds' sorts of things
[03:39:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> catern: Politics in a nutshell
[03:39:53] <saturn2> yeah, 2010 was about when gnome peaked, when they were mimicking apples successes and had not yet decided to mimic its mistakes
[03:40:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway, requiring CSD is manifestly moronic, and this move is justly seen as a gigantic piece of boneheaded insanity on GNOME's part
[03:42:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> *Allowing* CSD is of course fine, in the sense that a windowing system should permit application developers to opt out (ideally, with as much granularity as possible) of the default window widgets and decorations and so on

[05:25:33] <Logos01> Fun shower thoughts.
[05:25:51] <Logos01> How would any water utility company detect it if you are siphoning water *pressure* from a water main -- while returning 100% of the water back to the main before it crosses your home meter -- to generate hydroelectric power?
[05:26:58] <gwern> how would you maintain pressure in your own pipes?
[05:27:22] <Logos01> gwern: The reduction in flow would be negligible on the main.
[05:27:47] <gwern> doesn't sound like you'd be getting much electricity if you are reducing flow neglibly
[05:29:03] <Logos01> Back when I lived in Phoenix I actually had to have a better ratelimiter put on my home's connection to the city mains, because the city provided pressure far too high for the residential plumbing.
[05:29:22] <gwern> so, pressure is... too cheap to meter?
[05:29:38] <Logos01> Discovered that the limiter that was *supposed* to be there was not present when my house flooded due to a pipe burst.
[05:30:01] <gwern> and to think, you didn't even thank them for the excess pressure you weren't paying for
[05:30:18] <gwern> water pressure is not free, citizen!
[05:30:30] <Logos01> Volume gets metered; pressure doesn't.
[05:30:52] <Logos01> The pressure is kind of a side effect of needing to supply the entire district.  
[05:32:11] <Logos01> I mean I doubt you could do this minimally enough to actually power your home fully, but it *would* be baseload and if you already happened to have a home power meter that could operate in both directions then...
[05:32:42] <Logos01> "How are you generating so much more power than everyone else with your solar panels?" "Oh I just really make sure to wash them frequently."
[05:33:35] <Logos01> Like, siphoning 80psi to 78psi shouldn't really be noticeable, especially with how variable water demand is.
[05:34:02] <Logos01> (Note: I'm actually expecting that a water utlity would in fact figure out how to track this down. I just don't know how exactly they'd do it.)
[05:35:10] <gwern> why would they care?
[05:35:55] <Logos01> Because it would affect the utility grid the same way a main leak would -- potentially disrupt service to customers further downgrid.
[05:35:58] <Logos01> https://www.waterworld.com/home/article/14070706/successful-water-leak-detection-and-audit-methods 
[05:35:59] <Robomot> Successful Water Leak Detection and Audit Methods | WaterWorld
[05:36:24] <gwern> one consumer dropping pressure a little doesn't sound like a threat
[05:36:26] <Logos01> That page claims utility companies use aucoustic detection, listening for distinctive leak sounds.  
[05:37:02] <Logos01> gwern: It's normally functionally impossible for a residential customer to reduce pressure even 1psi.
[05:37:34] <saturn2> they could measure the pressure and flow volume at both ends of the water main and see if the pressure drop is more than expected
[05:37:41] <Logos01> But the idea here is that it wouldn't be hunted for on the basis of one person doing it, but as part of regular detection and maintenance of pressure losses and leaks.
[05:38:24] <Logos01> 'cause like a single 0.1psi loss is negligible. But 100 of them would be 1/8th loss of service capacity.
[05:38:36] <Logos01> (On the basis of mains running at 80psi)
[05:40:02] <Logos01> ... the idea *kind* of has merit as a backup emergency generator solution to go along with inline natural gas generators though.

[05:42:46] <PlanckWalk> Wouldn't the power you get be negligible?
[05:43:19] <Logos01> PlanckWalk: Depends on a lot of specifics. If you were genuinely trying to get away with it you'd get very little power though, definitely.
[05:43:28] <Logos01> (the tapping of the water mains idea that is.)
[05:43:51] <PlanckWalk> 1 psi at a litre per second gives you 7 watts
[05:44:18] <PlanckWalk> You'd need to scale up to a lot more psi and/or a lot more flow
[05:45:44] <Logos01> City mains flow a lot higher than 1 liter per second.
[05:45:55] <PlanckWalk> Yes, if you tap it at a major trunk
[05:46:16] <PlanckWalk> I was thinking you meant at some residential branch

[05:48:49] <PlanckWalk> I wouldn't expect the average flow through an unbroken pipe to be nearly as much as outflow from a broken one
[05:49:15] <Logos01> Which I mean ... a constant always-on rate of 21 watts year-round is a trickle compared to actual usage rates when you're actually *using* something, but if you have a power meter that operates in both directions you could get non-negligible benefits out of it.
[05:50:15] <PlanckWalk> Yes year-round is 9000 hours so you'd certainly get some kilowatt-hours outof it.
[05:50:16] <Logos01> On the other hand if you're looking at it as a backup emergency supply and you put the tap behind your home water meter but *before* the stepdown pressure regulator, you could get the full flow rate out of that, and use much more of the actual pressure.

[05:51:31] <PlanckWalk> Hehe

[05:57:49] <PlanckWalk> I think I'd prefer a solar panel personally, but it would be a possibility :)
[05:58:26] <PlanckWalk> Well, unless undead bring gloom and evil green clouds to block the sun.
[06:05:08] <Logos01> I mean, generally speaking you can count on there being an apocalyptic smoke/particulate cover from all the cities burning down due to lack of proper maintenance, yeah.
[06:05:24] <Logos01> But like also, solar panels only work when there's, y'know, sunlight.

[08:10:33] <spxtr> I tried and failed to reproduce a very influential computational paper from a few years back. I asked the author for their code and they sent it to me. So, so many things in their code are not the same as what they say in the paper.

[10:52:42] <nshepperd2> everyone is opposed
[10:53:24] <feep[work]> ivan: no I cannot turn gwern off.
[10:53:39] <feep[work]> nshepperd2: I really feel people don't understand what is happening.
[10:53:56] <feep[work]> and so instead of asking, about 50% of them guess (wrong)
[10:55:08] <feep[work]> ivan: in the name of science, what do you think feepbot is doing?
[10:55:15] <shawwwn> gee, I wonder why people don't understand what is happening
[10:55:26] <shawwwn> maybe because it's completely incomprehensible what feepbot might be doing
[10:55:27] <nshepperd2> by the time people realized what was happening, it was too late. the gwern could not be turned off...
[10:55:36] <shawwwn> and yes, I think you should keep it on, whatever it is
[10:55:45] <feep[work]> shawwwn: nothing wrong with not understanding what is happening, I didn't complain about that, I complained about them guessing instead of asking.
[10:55:46] <shawwwn> that way when gwern dies tomorrow, we'll still have a simulation
[10:55:57] <shawwwn> I didn't see anyone guess
[10:56:06] <feep[work]> see, that's what I thought people were guessing. it's not a simulation, it's authentic gwern.
[10:56:14] <feep[work]> fresh and unreposted.
[10:56:32] <shawwwn> oh.
[10:56:34] <shawwwn> then turn it off
[10:56:37] <feep[work]> XD
[10:56:41] <feep[work]> as I said, I cannot turn gwern off.
[10:56:55] <shawwwn> my nighttime is the rare time I have without gwern spamming the channel
[10:56:59] <feep[work]> ooh, I see
[10:57:02] <feep[work]> um
[10:57:06] <shawwwn> I'm just kidding
[10:57:14] <feep[work]> I am sad to report that invading your idle gwernless time is exactly the intent of the feature
[10:57:32] <shawwwn> why though?
[10:57:52] <shawwwn> I mean, I'm sort of amused that this is further proof this place is a cult, but
[10:58:05] <feep[work]> so gwern can avoid interrupting running conversations whenever he wants to use us as a news aggregator
[10:58:31] <shawwwn> but
[10:58:38] <feep[work]> gwern wants to paste. people want to talk. gwern doesn't want to wait for them to stop talking, because that's annoying.
[10:58:41] <feep[work]> the solution: gwernqueue~
[10:58:43] <shawwwn> the whole point of him posting things here is so that we can ask questions or say related things
[10:58:55] <feep[work]> shawwwn: honestly it's not like he'll answer any slower this way.
[10:59:03] <shawwwn> he's not here
[10:59:10] <shawwwn> there's no chance of discussion
[10:59:19] <feep[work]> again: that's not necessarily different with manual pastes.
[10:59:26] <shawwwn> sophistry
[10:59:30] <shawwwn> we're talking now
[10:59:30] <feep[work]> realism.
[10:59:41] <saturn2> don't be ridiculous feep
[11:00:02] <shawwwn> you just wanted to build some feature that gwern wants to use, because you're starry eyed ooooOooO GweRrrnnNnnn
[11:00:08] <feep[work]> I mean
[11:00:10] <feep[work]> yes, but
[11:00:10] <shawwwn> and of course gwern was like omg, I get to spam even more
[11:00:13] <nshepperd2> i actually agree with shawwwn's point there
[11:00:22] <ivan> haha
[11:00:26] <feep[work]> like, I completely agree with this depiction of events
[11:00:41] <nshepperd2> and i think the queue idea is dumb
[11:01:11] <shawwwn> it's the first time I felt like reaching for the /ignore command, and I have a visceral dislike for /ignore, but meh
[11:01:48] <feep[work]> I mean, what I'm kinda hearing here is "gwernpastes are only okay because of halo effect"?
[11:01:51] <nshepperd2> people who get annoyed with pastes in the middle of conversation should just suck it
[11:02:08] <feep[work]> feepbot doesn't have gwern's halo, so he's just annoying
[11:02:44] <nshepperd2> i can't talk to the halo
[11:03:08] <feep[work]> my standing theory is still that gwernpastes don't generally engender discussion with gwern
[11:03:13] <feep[work]> but I don't have the log stats to back that up
[11:04:31] * feep[work] mumbles something about parasocial relationships
[11:04:35] <saturn2> then why do you think it?
[11:04:44] <feep[work]> saturn2: just a general impression
[11:06:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwernpastes absolutely engender gwerndiscussion
[11:06:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> They... engwernder it
[11:06:27] <saturn2> do you even ever attempt to discuss a gwernpaste?
[11:06:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> Often
[11:06:38] <saturn2> i meant feep
[11:06:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh
[11:06:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> I feel like feep has actually done so? But I won't swear to it
[11:07:02] <saturn2> i can't think of a time gwern didn't respond when i said something relevant
[11:07:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> Likewise
[11:07:28] <feep[work]> fair enough
[11:07:52] <feep[work]> hm
[11:08:09] <feep[work]> saturn2: is the problem here the bot feature in itself or the long delay between queueing and posting?
[11:08:16] <feep[work]> cause we were thinking of lowering the idle timeout anyways.
[11:08:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> bot
[11:08:31] <feep[work]> which should raise the likelihood that gwern is around.
[11:08:35] <saturn2> idk, i wasn't bothered by it in the first place
[11:08:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> I do not like the gwernqueue
[11:09:04] <feep[work]> I mean      why
[11:10:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well, first of all, I reserve the right to dislike it without a concrete reason
[11:10:38] <feep[work]> sure
[11:10:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> But that being said, it's for the "can't talk to the gwernqueue" reason
[11:10:58] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: right, but that's what I mean, if gwern was probably around, would it be fine?
[11:11:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> It would be less bad but still bad
[11:11:25] <feep[work]> I really think ten minutes of idleness is just too high for this channel
[11:11:35] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: um      why tho
[11:11:45] <feep[work]> like, it *seems* like it addresses your objection
[11:11:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> Not even a little
[11:11:57] <saturn2> the bot should save any responses and have gwern respond to them later
[11:12:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's almost entirely irrelevant to my objection, in fact
[11:12:01] <nshepperd2> it seems strictly worse than ordinary pasting to me
[11:12:09] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: why? if you can treat the queue as if gwern said it..
[11:12:20] <ivan> if we keep talking, it will never gwernpost again
[11:12:20] <feep[work]> nshepperd2: I mean, I do think the ordinary pasting kinda sucks
[11:12:27] <nshepperd2> the only, dubious, benefit is to pacify the gwernpaste complainers, but evidently it doesn't do that
[11:12:44] <feep[work]> like, there's a topic going, bam gwernpaste, now we have a choice to drop the topic, ignore the gwernpaste, or run two convos at once
[11:12:49] <feep[work]> I dislike all those options
[11:12:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: Obviously the issue is that when you have manual gwernpastes, any paste is generated by gwern personally deciding to post a specific thing right at that moment, and thus, when I respond, I respond to a volitional action by gwern, who will therefore have the paste and its context in mind
[11:13:02] <nshepperd2> we can just exercise our free will
[11:13:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: With gwernqueue, zero of those things are true
[11:13:27] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: okay, so you actually value the immediacy of the gwern feed.
[11:13:37] <feep[work]> and the unmediated direct relationship
[11:13:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> There's no need to translate what I said into some other thing, which is not what I said and is only tangentially relevant
[11:14:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> The thing I said was clear enough
[11:14:08] <feep[work]> I'm trying to understand what you said in my terms.
[11:14:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> Your terms are wrong!

[11:14:21] <feep[work]> okay
[11:14:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway, "there's a topic going, bam gwernpaste, now we have a choice to drop the topic, ignore the gwernpaste, or run two convos at once" *is the point*
[11:14:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's gwernpastes working as intended

[11:15:19] <feep[work]> what does that even mean
[11:15:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> Thus prompting us to behave correctly
[11:15:31] * feep[work] ???
[11:15:42] <rmmh> it's ok I'll just ignore feepbot <gwern>
[11:16:10] <shawwwn> I wish I could ignore feepbot <gwern>. I can only ignore feepbot
[11:16:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> Truly gwernpastes pave the path of the righteous man with the paving-stones of inescapable text
[11:16:22] <feep[work]> this does not clarify anything!
[11:16:27] <shawwwn> and I can't believe i'm saying this, but I agree entirely with Obormot. for once. on one thing.
[11:16:34] <feep[work]> shawwwn: can you explain it to me
[11:16:36] <nshepperd2> i don't think those choices are bad
[11:16:41] <shawwwn> ^
[11:16:43] <feep[work]> nshepperd2: OKAY, that take I can get behind
[11:16:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yep they are good choices
[11:16:52] <feep[work]> that makes a lot more sense than "they are correct"
[11:17:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> No it's the same thing
[11:17:03] <shawwwn> feep[work]: the problem is, we're human and we like talking to humans
[11:17:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> They're good because they are correct
[11:17:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> Correctness is necessarily goodness
[11:17:19] <nshepperd2> (except in the #lw-gpt exclusion zone)
[11:17:28] <shawwwn> talking to a bot isn't too satisfying. if I wanted to see gwern's takes, I could load up twitter.com/gwern and see them
[11:17:38] <feep[work]> shawwwn: I can't :(
[11:17:45] <shawwwn> oh.
[11:17:57] <shawwwn> that's gwern being retarded
[11:18:06] <shawwwn> omgz teh twitterz r scarrryyyYyy
[11:18:17] <shawwwn> Better lock my account to supposedly guard against them
[11:18:17] <feep[work]> nshepperd2: hang on, is this the model where most convos that gwern interrupts are bad and should stop?
[11:18:27] <shawwwn> when in reality I'm just locking my account to be all "exclusive and cool" and more fronting
[11:18:32] <feep[work]> nshepperd2: cause gwern explicitly said he's reserving the right to gwernpaste into convos that need interrupting
[11:18:32] <shawwwn> but I digress
[11:18:44] <shawwwn> look
[11:19:16] <shawwwn> when I told gwern to stfu about the gwernpaste, I was joking. we give each other a hard time.
[11:19:26] <shawwwn> he probably wants you to believe that people had a problem with him pasting here
[11:19:31] <shawwwn> I assure you, no one seems to mind
[11:19:35] <feep[work]> I kind of mind!
[11:19:47] <shawwwn> the idea that gwern can't paste here is an invented idea
[11:19:52] <feep[work]> I mean, I don't *mind*, I just don't thin--- nobody
[11:19:54] <shawwwn> a product of your glorious mind and gwern's not so glorious mind
[11:19:54] <nshepperd2> it's the model that most perceived 'interruptions' are illusory and you can still exercise your free will to continue or stop
[11:19:56] <feep[work]> no hold on shut up shawwwn
[11:20:10] <feep[work]> the idea that people *think* that gwern can't paste here is an invented idea!
[11:20:12] <nshepperd2> it's just a paste, not the end of the world
[11:20:20] <shawwwn> ^
[11:20:22] <feep[work]> that's not afaict what anyone is saying
[11:20:46] <feep[work]> nshepperd2: that's not the .... okay, to be clear.
[11:20:52] <shawwwn> then why on earth would people want to see gwern's random one-line gwernqueue every few hours, out of context, when you can't talk about it with anyone?
[11:20:52] <saturn2> did anyone even ask for this? i thought gwern came up with it himself
[11:20:59] <feep[work]> 1. I am not doing this because I personally want gwernpastes to stop, I'm doing it cause gwern asked me to
[11:21:07] <shawwwn> yes, gwern asks for a lot of things
[11:21:09] <feep[work]> 2. even so, I think gwernpastes are worse than time delayed gwernpastes, *because*:
[11:21:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern came up with this himself and I expressed skepticism and I was right
[11:21:25] <shawwwn> much like a dog who will eat himself to death if given the opportunity, you occasionally have to hit gwern on the nose with a rolled-up newspaper
[11:21:30] <feep[work]> what gwern pastes is valuable, what conversations are going on is usually *also* valuable.
[11:21:32] <shawwwn> most of his ideas have merit
[11:21:33] <feep[work]> if you space it out, you get more value!
[11:21:45] <shawwwn> but he has a total blindspot when it comes to him, himself, and anything related to perception of others about him
[11:21:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> No
[11:21:56] <feep[work]> you get the convo, and you also get the other convo, how is that not a straight improvement, contentwise
[11:22:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> Because gwernpastes are valuable *because* they're posted directly by gwern himself, while there are people here
[11:22:04] <saturn2> the conversations going on are usually not valuable
[11:22:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> If you do this time delay business then you get neither of the things I said
[11:22:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> Turning them from valuable into valueless
[11:22:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> Therefore gwernqueue is bad and wrong
[11:22:33] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: I think gwernpastes are valuable for their content, not generally for gwern *being the one who posts them*, that's evidence of value but not source of value.
[11:22:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: Wrong, because see above about volitional action
[11:22:53] <feep[work]> that said, I really think the queue would work better with a smaller timeout, possibly a much smaller timeout, like one or two minutes.
[11:23:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> It is absolutely a *source* of value

[11:23:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> Indeed, it's a greater source of value than their content
[11:24:02] <saturn2> feep[work]: how about a 10 minute maximum delay
[11:24:08] <feep[work]> saturn2: sure, no problem
[11:25:03] <feep[work]> (not rn though, because appearances aside, I *am* at work.)
[11:25:10] <saturn2> so if some moron has been rambling about getting energy from water pipes for over 10 minutes, it all gets scrolled off the screen by gwernpastes
[11:25:49] <feep[work]> saturn2: again, gwern still intends to manually interrupt trash convos. this was noted earlier.
[11:26:47] <feep[work]> I'm sort of seeing the point of gwernqueue as "gwern just wants to dump a link and move on"
[11:27:12] <shawwwn> okay but fuck that, fuck you (I love you jk) and fuck the idea that gwern should get to do that
[11:27:13] <saturn2> he hasn't been doing a very good job of that
[11:27:14] <feep[work]> which is why I assumed that no gwern-involving convo would come of it.
[11:28:12] <shawwwn> tell you what. I promise to stop complaining as long as you open up this queue to anyone who wants to use it. And then I'll be flooding my shawwwnqueue with hentai
[11:28:22] <feep[work]> shawwwn: tbh like, if gwern wants to waste less time here talking to you fuckers, but keeps being dragged into conversations, then I submit that this is actually Good And Right.
[11:28:30] <shawwwn> whether or not you want to see hentai, feepbot will post it at least once every couple hours

[13:06:33] <saturn2> yeah, they don't care
[13:06:44] <dbohdan> feep[work]: So far, I think I am okay with both manual gwernpastes and the gwernqueue.  I typically respond to gwern asynchronously anyway, and when he replies (which I can confirm he does), it is also asynchronously.  A shorter delay is a good idea.
[13:07:20] <dbohdan> feep[work]: 'what I'm kinda hearing here is "gwernpastes are only okay because of halo effect"?'  Maybe it's the opposite: bots have a negative halo effect
[13:07:29] <feep[work]> horns effect :)
[13:07:32] <dbohdan> Yes
[13:07:54] <feep[work]> very possible
[13:09:54] <dbohdan> feep[work]: One way that the gwernqueue may be worse than manual gwernpastes: does feepbot resolve URLs in what it pastes?  If not, using the queue means we don't get the linked pages' titles we would get with a manual paste.
[13:10:08] <feep[work]> true but that'd be easy to fix

[15:18:07] <feep[work]> holy shit, I'm trying to do a straightforward data manipulation task with libreoffice calc
[15:18:13] <feep[work]> and it's remarkable how bad it is
[15:18:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> So I was thinking about this Nasreddin story https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasreddin#The_Sermon (which may be my favorite, or close to it, of the Nasreddin corpus)
[15:18:18] <Robomot> Nasreddin - Wikipedia [The Sermon] (Nasreddin or Nasreddin Hodja or Mullah Nasreddin Hooja (/næsˈrɛdɪn/[1]) or Mullah Nasruddin (1208-1285) was a Seljuk satirist, born in Hortu Village in Sivrihisar, Eskişehir Province, present-day Turkey and died in 13th century in Akşehir, near Konya, a capital of the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum, in today's Turkey.[ …)
[15:18:31] <PapuaHardyNet> feep: surely you could use google sheets then?
[15:18:43] <feep[work]> well, I mean, I'm not sure if this can be done anywhere
[15:18:47] <feep[work]> and I know google sheets even less
[15:18:50] *** Joins: galambo_ (~galambo@user/galambo)
[15:19:08] <feep[work]> what I want is, I have a bunch of rows, and I want to sort them into columns based on the value of the cell in one column
[15:19:18] <feep[work]> groupby, effectively
[15:19:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> And, like... what's the lesson there? (The lesson of the story, and/or the lesson Nasreddin was trying to teach the people who invited him to give the sermon - either way it's the same)
[15:19:51] <PapuaHardyNet> well, that sounds like something easily done with pandas
[15:20:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> It seems to me that it's more or less this: the people invited Nasreddin to give the sermon because he was famed as a wise man, etc. But the people's attitude toward "wisdom" was all wrong... they expected, what? That he would come, and speak some very wise words, and they would listen, enraptured, and become wiser themselves, thereby, as if by magic
[15:22:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's not like the people hoped to hear Nasreddin's views on some particular topic, or had specific questions to ask him... they just expected to absorb his wisdom, by some sort of osmosis, and the question of what subject the sermon was to be on ... didn't concern them
[15:22:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well... it strikes me that this is pretty much exactly the problem with all of that "insight meditation", "enlightenment", "kensho", etc. stuff.
[15:22:56] *** Quits: galambo (~galambo@user/galambo) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[15:22:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's the same attitude!
[15:23:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> You just open your mind to generic, unspecified wisdom / insight / whatever, and you are visited by wisdom, and, as if by magic - you are *enlightened*!
[15:24:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's a totally passive attitude
[15:24:48] <Gurkenglas> feep[work], you mean Data->Sort?
[15:26:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> But just as in the Nasreddin story ... it doesn't work that way. If you do not put anything into the search for knowledge, you won't get anything out of it. If you don't have any interesting questions, you won't receive any useful answers... which sounds banal when you put it like that, but isn't it obviously foolish to expect the opposite? And isn't *expecting the opposite of that* exactly what the enlightenment/meditation/et
[15:26:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> c. approach is?
[15:27:04] <feep[work]> Gurkenglas: no I explicitly want to turn a 1D table into a 2D table on a pivot key
[15:27:16] <feep[work]> but only on one axis
[15:27:30] <feep[work]> ie. group on x, enumerate on y.
[15:27:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> If "enlightenment" is just a state you can enter, a thing you can absorb, by some sort of osmosis, but *isn't* the answer to any actual question about anything, then ... it's nothing. Obviously.
[15:27:42] <feep[work]> so I can draw a chart of each "category".
[15:28:02] <feep[work]> alternately, if you could tell me how to draw a sparse graph, that'd be great too
[15:28:39] <feep[work]> ie. I have an X column and a bunch of Y columns, whose value may be absent
[15:28:48] <Gurkenglas> feep[work], is it really 1D->2D or rather 2D->3D?
[15:28:56] <feep[work]> it's really 1D->2D.
[15:29:12] <feep[work]> this is a bunch of timestamped log lines for multiple processes.
[15:29:18] <Gurkenglas> so you want to count the occurences of each entry
[15:29:20] <feep[work]> no!
[15:29:37] <Gurkenglas> but if you group by equality then every group will be made of equal entries, yes?
[15:29:39] <feep[work]> look, I have 1000 timestamped lines, each has a process field and a result field
[15:29:46] <feep[work]> I want to chart the values over time
[15:30:02] <Gurkenglas> aight, that's what i would have described by it actually being 2D :3
[15:30:09] <feep[work]> well in any case afaict it cannot be done

[15:32:59] <Robomot> Jerry Fodor · Water’s water everywhere · LRB 21 October 2004
[15:33:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Royalties aside, what have they [Continental philosophers] got that we haven’t? It’s not the texture of their prose I shouldn’t think, since most of us write better than most of them. ... True, we sometimes presuppose more logic than you’re likely to come across on the omnibus to Clapham. But I’m told that an intelligent reading of Heidegger requires knowing more about Kant, Hegel and the Pre-Socratics than I, for
[15:33:45] <Obormot\Arcturus>  one, am eager to learn. Anyhow, our arguments are better than theirs. So sometimes I wonder why nobody (except philosophers) reads (Anglophone, analytic) philosophy these days."
[15:34:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> "But, having just worked through Christopher Hughes’s _Kripke: Names, Necessity and Identity_, I am no longer puzzled."
[15:35:02] <Gurkenglas> feep[work], have you played around with Insert->Pivot Table?
[15:35:06] <feep[work]> yes.
[15:35:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> "And yet I can’t shake off the sense that something has gone awfully wrong. Not so much with Hughes’s book (though I’ll presently have bones to pick with some of his main theses) as with the kind of philosophy that has recently taken shelter under Kripke’s wing. There seems to be, to put it bluntly, a lot of earnest discussion of questions that strike my ear as frivolous. ... For example: ... ‘Water is the stuff that
[15:35:25] <Obormot\Arcturus>  is in the Thames and comes out of the taps. The stuff that is in the Thames and comes out of the taps undeniably contains impurities (bits that are neither hydrogen nor oxygen nor constituents thereof). So how can water be H2O?’ But how could it not? Is it that, chemistry having discovered the nature of water, philosophy proposes to undiscover it?"
[15:35:28] <feep[work]> it runs in the hindrance that I *don't* want to accumulate a result.
[15:35:48] <feep[work]> I want to columnize.
[15:36:08] <feep[work]> and I only want that so I can make a diagram with multiple lines.
[15:36:43] <feep[work]> if diagrams had a way to use a cell to assign the diagram line, I'd use that
[15:38:49] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: uh like, reading that article, I agree that something has awfully wrong, and it's that philosophers still command respect :v

[16:06:58] <feep[work]> Gurkenglas: okay, the actual reason the diagram didn't work was cause I had data like 2.5
[16:07:03] <feep[work]> but my libreoffice was set to german locale :/
[16:07:06] <feep[work]> ie 2,5
[16:07:23] <feep[work]> and I still can't draw connecting lines cause there's no way to make an equation yield an empty cell
[16:07:59] <feep[work]> it works with dots tho
[16:08:14] <feep[work]> Gurkenglas: basically, I cheated a bit by starting with a pivot table for *just* the grouping cell
[16:08:44] <feep[work]> then make a row "pivottable.$A1" and expand it to the right
[16:09:00] <Gurkenglas> i mean i also cheated by sorting the table by the grouping cell first (though hmm maybe i dont need to)
[16:09:25] <feep[work]> then, for every cell underneath those columns, I just do =if(namefield==header;valuefield;NA())
[16:09:39] <feep[work]> and the diagram appears to properly skip those, at least sort of.
[16:10:02] <Gurkenglas> yeah my current approach does a bunch of match and address and indirect and pointer arithmetic
[16:10:45] <feep[work]> mine leaves a bunch of spam in the bottom of the diagram

[16:11:16] <feep[work]> the chart*
[16:11:27] <feep[work]> cause all the cases where the cell *doesn't* match the row, it'll put a #N/A
[16:11:31] <feep[work]> and the diagram parses that as "0"
[16:11:39] <feep[work]> I've yet to find a value that makes the diagram *skip* an entry.

[16:42:11] <feep[work]> then I prepare a bunch of column headers with names *from the pivot table* using autofill
[16:42:12] <Gurkenglas> oh you dont filter by the key field
[16:42:16] <feep[work]> nono, I do
[16:42:31] <Gurkenglas> uhh i mean you didnt select the key field as a Filter in the pivot table

We found that slightly increased within-word letter spacing was potentially
[20:14:16] <dbohdan2> helpful to some people with dyslexia,” she explains.  And she suggests that the reason Comic Sans may have earned a dyslexia-friendly reputation could be down to this, rather than anything to do with the font’s shape or style.  Write the same line in Comic Sans and in another font in MS Word, she says, one above the other, and the line in Comic Sans will usually stretch furthest along the page. It’s

[22:28:54] <gwern> dbohdan: that's because the reader has knuckled under the current hierarchy but bristles at elevating any new groups, and any new titles automatically implies new groups in power and power transfer away from the reader
[22:29:36] <dbohdan> gwern: "any new titles automatically implies new groups in power"  Oh yeah, I think it's this
[22:29:47] <gwern> "Programmer Smith" immediately conjures dystopian fantasies of a programmer-priesthood ruling your life in microscopic detail, compared to your current life, where you feel 'free'
[22:29:49] <pompolic> thinking back to old shit, most of my unintentional trolling was, i think, via describing power relations
[22:29:57] <dbohdan> Great deduction
[22:30:23] <gwern> now, in reality, we already have a programmer-priesthood, but their power is transferred from *other* groups, like actual priests, or politicians
[22:30:48] <pompolic> idea: make up your own ontology and serialize it into conversation (to efficiently get yelled at)
[22:30:55] <pompolic> bespoke honorifics
[22:31:15] <pompolic> brb memeing myself into making a conlang
[22:31:17] <gwern> the net effect on your life has been to make you more powerful, or at least about the same as before, but given loss/risk aversion and the well known tendency to remember only the good things about the past, you always feel increasingly disempowered and crushed by anti-egalitarian trends
[22:32:45] <gwern> it's actually quite difficult to think of any popular dystopia which doesn't have the reader thinking of themselves being crushed under a new power-elite
[22:33:55] <adiabatic> "it's a dystopia, but only for other people" sounds like an underrepresented setting
[22:35:34] * dbohdan is having awful ideas for new honorifics
[22:35:47] <dbohdan> Woke: emoji pronouns / Bespoke: emoji honorifics
[22:36:04] <gwern> adiabatic: there's the occasional 'child of the elite who discovers their idyllic life is built on suffering and leads the oppressed to revolutionary victory' trope
[22:36:36] <adiabatic> gwern: yeah, but doesn't that always get manipulated into "this dystopia is a bad thing"
[22:36:55] <gwern> adiabatic: are you saying you would just live happily in Omelas? YOU MONSTER
[22:36:57] <dbohdan> gwern: Are we supposed to relate to the elite protagonist or the messes they lead?
[22:37:02] <dbohdan> *masses :-)
[22:37:08] <adiabatic> "dystopia, but this is fine" seems harder to pull off, or possibly just doesn't get mentioned much
[22:37:24] <adiabatic> gwern: never picked up the book, much less walked away from it
[22:37:25] <milanandreew> arguably 
[22:37:33] <milanandreew> Winston is quite privileged
[22:37:43] <milanandreew> I mean, he isn't a prole
[22:37:49] <adiabatic> he's in the middle.
[22:37:55] <adiabatic> O'Brien probably eats better.
[22:38:43] <gwern> isn't winston just a low-level clerk who accidentally sees something classified? he isn't even in the inner party
[22:38:56] <dbohdan> IIRC, yes
[22:39:17] <dbohdan> We doesn't qualify for anything better
[22:40:18] <milanandreew> yeah he saw that newspaper that showed  the old members of the politburo or something... I think he worked in marketing
[22:40:25] <adiabatic> Oh hm. I remember seeing this one anime on Netflix with this one guy called "Barohcruz" (obviously garbled "Veracruz") that involved groups of humans on both earth and mars and they were at war and martian society was very unequal but that's mainly because the knights or whatever had some kind of techno magic that not everyone had
[22:40:57] <adiabatic> that might've been dystopian if you're really hellbent on political + legal equality
[22:41:46] <saturn2> "dystopia, but this is fine" is just real life

[23:03:19] <saturn2> why would the powerful legibilize the real power structure rather than construct a fake one for scapegoating purposes?
[23:03:45] <pompolic> they wouldn't
[23:06:20] <pompolic> i think my angle pretty much has to do with reverse engineering
[23:06:56] <pompolic> reflexively popping layers of abstraction / pulling back the curtain on things
[23:07:02] <gwern> legibility can be useful. but in scenarios where institutions are feuding internally, elite overproduction, a surge of egalitarianism etc, being legible just means being a *target*
[23:07:14] <pompolic> with reverse engineering proper, you can develop magical thinking about how a program functions, or you can go look
[23:07:32] <pompolic> "going and looking" seems to be my niche wrt that

[23:16:46] <pompolic> i fit the clueless mold pretty well as a literal child
[23:19:18] <pompolic> i have some distaste for the powertalk of the sociopath archetype described therein

[23:20:43] <pompolic> yep
[23:21:17] <pompolic> i think internalizing the Sociopath stuff and memeing myself into high dark triad traits were a risk growing up
[23:21:50] *** Joins: Urchin[emacs] (~user@user/urchin)
[23:23:17] <pompolic> wrt my home country, i'm pretty sure that's what the play that's being played at the moment
[23:23:41] <gwern> as usual, we need more checklists/flowcharts for advice. there are people who need to read the gervais principle, and people who need to never read it
[23:24:40] <dbohdan2> I wonder to what extent you can meme yourself into Dark Triad traits.  Is it a "if you can fake it, you are it" thing?
[23:25:19] <pompolic> i'd say it depends
[23:25:43] <gwern> machiavellianism seems doable - it is what you do. I'm less sure about sadism. can you meme yourself into genuine enjoyment of others' suffering?
[23:25:52] <pompolic> something like, if you have good enough metacognitive skills, you can approximate it
[23:26:09] <gwern> you can develop tastes for bitter foods like wine or chocolate, so maybe if you work hard enough at it you can become a conoisseur of pain
[23:26:13] <pompolic> i think to some extent it will remain self-deception still
[23:26:32] <gwern> narcissism ultimately seems quite difficult to induce in yourself: you know you're doing it
[23:26:48] <pompolic> I was remembering the other day that my first metacognitive-flavored thought was at around 4
[23:27:06] <dbohdan2> Maybe there is a chemical path to narcissism
[23:27:07] <pompolic> and i think this is a risk if the rest of your personality hasn't grown in, so to speak
[23:27:40] * dbohdan2 thinks of Scott's "Samsara"
[23:27:48] <pompolic> this is kind of informed by Pete Walker's book on CPTSD, which seems to describe a similar process
[23:29:00] <gwern> with enough environmental reinforcement early on, it may be possible. I read _the great successor_ on the plane back about kim jong pork, and as she describes it, un seemed psychologically fairly normal as a child to everyone on record, but it also seems like he's genuinely narcissistic now, and he had started to be molded into it by age 10 as he clearly became the best candidate and...
[23:29:06] <gwern> ...jong-il's health began declining rapidly
[23:29:22] <pompolic> broadly, if you have some ability to self-modify, janky as it is, and your incentives will lead you to do so
[23:29:28] <gwern> but that's a pretty extraordinary circumstance, with letting a kid order around generals etc
[23:30:04] <gwern> and literally a country-wide personality cult being built around you

[23:31:28] <gwern> (his sister comes off as a flatout sociopath, and you get the sense that she would've been a better choice, if not for her sex, which just doesn't fly in NK)
[23:35:28] <dbohdan2> If one's feeling of importance is Dunbar-capped, a mildly popular streamer with a minority of rabid fans always present and interacting with them feels like they have a country-wide personality cult
[23:36:11] <dbohdan2> What happens to adoptive children of cult leaders raise in the cult?
[23:36:58] <gwern> possibly, but it still doesn't fully replicate it. porkie is *always* surrounded by such people, who then do what he says no matter what it is. a streamer may have a large audience, but is as much at their mercy as any of them could be said to be at their mercy
[23:37:10] <gwern> most streamers are painfully aware of how poor they are
[23:37:22] <gwern> porkie is more perplexed by which palace to vacation at this weekend
[23:37:58] <pompolic> hm, i think it also touches on Meditations on Moloch then
[23:38:04] <ggreer> are there many historical examples of authoritarian dictatorships/monarchies being converted because someone convinced the ruler that reforms would benefit everyone?
[23:38:10] <pompolic> my impression of streaming, etc. is that it's intensely competitive
[23:38:11] <dbohdan2> gwern: True, I agree
[23:38:31] <gwern> sure. I mean, you ever hear of anyone personally loyal to porkie, who likes him? other than, like dennis rodman who's a moron
[23:38:40] <gwern> his family is loyal to Kim Inc, not him
[23:39:01] <ggreer> my guess is that dictators are worried about betrayal, and if they try to reform they risk being overthrown by a faction that claims the ruler no longer represents the true spirit of the country
[23:40:09] <kuudes> I like the current finnish national honorifics system, where some titles anyone can propose but someone has to pay the title tax in order for the title to be granted
[23:40:35] <gwern> the usual story about un is that he killed his uncle and half-brother etc as part of the intial purges to establish his power, and that the subsequent stuff about 'ski parks near pyonyang' etc is both a mix of pragmatic reform and also attempting to coopt the pyongyang elites who collectively are the major threat to him once the first-hand elite like his uncle were appropriately cowed
[23:40:52] <ggreer> kuudes: license fees for honorifics? ooh I want that in ancapistan

[23:41:15] <kuudes> ggreer, yes! :D
[23:41:19] <pompolic> i like this as well
[23:41:22] <gwern> the idea being that un can trickle out slight improvements to the urban elite
[23:41:40] <kuudes> tax is fixed, rarer titles cost more
[23:41:52] <ggreer> dbohdan: people on meth seem to be pretty narcissistic. they also claim ridiculous levels of status and power
[23:42:07] <ggreer> what's the most expensive title? how much for "god-emperor"?
[23:42:09] <gwern> (avoiding proto-capitalists getting too strong to outright challenge the state, while also not disappointing expectations - drip out the improvements as slowly and steadily as possible, so you don't waste gains)
[23:42:14] <kuudes> there is separate council that sort of preapproves the application and notifies the applicaters if they "might want to apply for lower title"
[23:42:19] <kuudes> vuorineuvos
[23:42:25] <kuudes> mountain counciller, I think
[23:42:29] <kuudes> we don't have any mountains
[23:42:36] <ggreer> nice
[23:42:39] <gwern> 'In all, there are 110 different honorary titles in use. They are not translated into foreign languages.' darn
[23:43:02] <pompolic> maybe the real mountains were in our hearts all along
[23:43:06] <kuudes> :D
[23:43:06] <gwern> 'All names of public offices and organisations are highly culture-specific and can only be expressed in another language and cultural context if accompanied by an explanation. Some honorary titles, such as 'vuorineuvos', do not actually refer to the title holder's work or other activities, while others are similar to job titles: asessori, hallitusneuvos, yli-insinööri. Even if a foreign...
[23:43:12] <gwern> ...language equivalent is agreed for a job title, such a translation should never be used for a similar honorary title.' :thinking_face:

[23:44:13] <pompolic> i'm half-remembering some joke i read about it in a history book
[23:44:26] <ggreer> gwern: seems like NK has a lot of squandered potential. is the risk of reforming faster really that great? I mean how long do religious cults take to reform from within? the only example that comes to my mind is mormonism, which was pacified within a generation

[23:44:58] <kuudes> ggreer, on the other hand, nk is in the extreme side of cult
[23:45:03] <ggreer> I think NK is best modeled as "what if jim jones ruled a country of 25 million people?"
[23:45:04] <gwern> ggreer: it has extraordinary amounts of squandered potential, but what do the kims care? they'd rule NK as it is for all eternity if they could
[23:45:09] <kuudes> I would think it is more culty than scientologism
[23:45:32] <ggreer> sure they capture a lot of the value right now, but they could capture a smaller amount of a bigger pie and end up even better off

[23:46:26] <ggreer> amusingly bill gates is now funding several artificial meat companies
[23:46:49] <gwern> but if they succeed, the meat will be cheap and the more expensive hamburgers won't be much tastier then too :)
[23:46:56] <ggreer> heh
[23:47:16] <ggreer> maybe they'll clone the best kobe beef cells and get ultra tasty burgers
[23:50:25] <dbohdan2> If he succeeds perversely, bad meat substitutes will crowd out good meat and his burgers will become relatively more tasty than the commoner's
[23:50:42] <dbohdan2> Positional cooking
[23:51:10] <ggreer> most people in the US can already afford however much meat they want. anything that usurps it will have to taste the same or better
[23:52:12] <dbohdan2> I am not being very serious :-)
[23:52:47] <ggreer> NK is so poor that it seems like only a matter of time before the ruling people are worse off than middle class people in developed countries
[23:53:15] <ggreer> and they don't seem to be catching up. 
[23:53:32] *** Joins: Urchin[emacs] (~user@user/urchin)
[23:54:14] <gwern> to buy the loyalty of the ruling class, they don't need to be richer than the middle classes somewhere they've never been, they just need to believe they are slightly better off than they were yesterday, and fearful that any disloyalty will make them *much* worse off tomorrow
[23:54:17] <kuudes> how long did kims survive?
[23:55:14] <gwern> (is it so hard to understand why they might be loyal when dbohdan has to keep saying that family keeps him in one of the most dangerous places in the world despite having one of the most marketable skillsets & language profiencies in the world?)
[23:56:31] <gwern> this is another thing that _the great successor_ is good at, describing how little a pittance it takes to buy pyongyang loyalty, because standards even there are *so* low. wow, a Starbucks coffee! a 5-year-old Android smartphone! is that... a *French* (-style) restaurant?!
[23:57:03] <ggreer> the incentives make sense, but the kim family has to rule by fear forever, and the upsides of defecting become greater and greater as the rest of the world gets richer
[23:57:34] <gwern> well, they've already ruled by fear for almost a century. that's a good start.
[23:57:46] <pompolic> that reminds me of fridge socialism in the... 70s?
[23:58:10] <gwern> and un's strategy seems to be to try to ride the tiger by funneling as much of the surplus into state repression as possible, and develop a panopticon like china
[23:58:16] <ggreer> it seems like one of those things that has to change at some point, but the inflection point is impossible to predict
[23:58:20] <pompolic> hungary had a policy of keeping standards of life high after the cracks started to show
[23:58:34] <gwern> oh yeah. I still believe that NK could easily have its Arab-Spring or glasnost moment
[23:58:50] <gwern> that's always in the cards. you can never rule it out
[23:59:21] <pompolic> pretty much. took until the SU collapsing in the case of hungary
[23:59:23] <gwern> but it's also very low probability on a day to day basis. so, castro lived out his extremely long lifetime without being dethroned. as did jong-il
[23:59:44] <gwern> just probability streaks
