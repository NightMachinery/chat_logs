[00:47:03] <bomb> that's great
[00:47:08] <sysRPL> people are moving  and they can't take these things with them
[00:47:12] <jonp> transportation of a baby grand piano is…not cheap

[02:12:01] <Nasp> 140 year is something else
[02:12:26] <bomb> why did you let it to be destroyed?
[02:12:39] <Nasp> It got transfered to my brother because he wanted to have it in his basement

[02:46:55] <Slade> which is probably why they have a distillery :P
[02:47:20] <Slade> anyhow the owner is a chemical engineer, and puts a lot of thought and science behind the batches

[03:18:55] <jonp> no business actually wants competition
[03:19:00] <jonp> not even the small ones
[03:19:09] <brianonymous> sure, but that doesnt mean it shouldnt happen
[03:19:18] <brianonymous> thats what drives evolution
[03:19:25] <jonp> on the one hand, sure, on the other hand, roflmao
[03:19:46] <brianonymous> the auto industry is a great example. every one of those bitches shoulda fell flat
[03:19:53] <jonp> "competition" is a suckers market
[03:20:07] <jonp> so yeah, take the auto industry
[03:20:16] <jonp> nobody "competes" on making the "same" (identical) thing
[03:20:24] <jonp> they all use different nouns/"things" to differentiate
[03:20:25] <JakeSays> brianonymous: why?
[03:20:35] <brianonymous> JakeSays: the only one that didnt get bailed out was Ford
[03:20:35] <jonp> which makes comparison shopping harder
[03:20:51] <JakeSays> brianonymous: right, so not every one of 'em :p
[03:20:54] <jonp> which likewise doesn't matter much, because most consumers don't even consider anything other than their first brand
[03:20:58] <brianonymous> sure, it becomes a feature race instead of a product one..
[03:21:12] <brianonymous> but i would say thats all the indications of too bigness.
[03:21:15] <brianonymous> nobody had to try
[03:21:36] <jonp> i slightly disagree; it's not "too big"
[03:21:43] <jonp> *every* company does the same thing, regardless of size
[03:21:54] <jonp> *nobody* wants to compete on a "level playing field"
[03:21:56] <jonp> that's a fools game
[03:22:10] <brianonymous> i absolutely agree, but if nature would have run its true course, we would have an entirely new set of auto industry players right now
[03:22:24] <brianonymous> yes, the end game is always corporatism
[03:22:29] <jonp> disagree; what is the "true course" that would result in a different set of players?
[03:22:40] <brianonymous> they almost all evaporated in 08
[03:22:48] <brianonymous> and if that was the case, they shoulda
[03:22:59] <jonp> likewise disagree. ;-)
[03:23:11] <JakeSays> brianonymous: not an entirely new set. ford would still be around
[03:23:14] <jonp> the top-level players have *huge* ecosystems they support
[03:23:17] <brianonymous> JakeSays: lol, yes
[03:23:28] <jonp> letting them die would hugely impact the entire industry and lots of smaller players.
[03:23:30] <brianonymous> i agree, they do
[03:23:34] <jonp> which is why the Fed intervened
[03:23:40] <jonp> to keep it from getting horribly bad
[03:23:54] <brianonymous> but i do believe that capitalism can and perhaps even now, has, gone off the rails
[03:24:19] <brianonymous> its just the inevitable end game.. and i truly believe that fail states are a natural process of that to run healthy
[03:24:21] <jonp> the more i read, the more i'm inclined to agree that "capitalism" is basically a form of slavery, "evolved"
[03:24:31] <jonp> or builds upon the same fundamental rulesets
[03:24:40] <jonp> "but now we have choice!"
[03:24:53] * jonp looks at the number of food brands that *actually* exist
[03:24:59] <jonp> choice is an illusion
[03:25:04] <brianonymous> you can see the contrast between the industrial age and the tech age, late stage type of shit
[03:25:08] <jonp> i have no answers
[03:25:13] <JakeSays> i remember when they big three were before congress. they asked the ceos if they would be willing to reduce their salaries to $1/year. GM said yes, Chrysler said yes, Ford said no. it was awesome.

[03:27:46] <Nasp> Also sounds like very little
[03:27:46] <bomb> Nasp I still have that, but half of the country is at $9/day for real
[03:27:52] <jonp> JakeSays: *not* the states, probably
[03:28:06] * jonp keeps forgetting how many on this channel aren't Americans
[03:28:09] <brianonymous> and dont get me wrong, im not anti-capitalistic.. not in the slightest. its just that i think the the inevitable run-through result is the megacorp/govt alliance
[03:28:10] <Nasp> :D
[03:28:14] <bomb> yeah I managed to find somewhere worse to born lol
[03:28:35] <jonp> brianonymous: i'm slightly anti-capitalist; i just don't have a better system to recommend.
[03:28:46] <jonp> capitalism, as practiced in the US, is "not great"
[03:28:46] <Nasp> Well more capitalist than socialist
[03:28:53] <jonp> better than others, perhaps.  but not great.
[03:28:57] <JakeSays> i'm anti-big-bank
[03:29:03] <jonp> JakeSays: i'll buy in with that.
[03:29:06] <Nasp> Anti big government sector
[03:29:12] <bomb> primitive anarchy
[03:29:15] <Nasp> But yeah banks should fuck off
[03:29:28] <Nasp> Ohh there's a case going in here that negative interest rates in the banks might be illegal
[03:29:32] <Nasp> That surely sounds interesting
[03:29:52] <brianonymous> jonp: yeah, i dont either
[03:29:58] <bomb> support cryptocurencies, then. that's the closest alternative we have to the traditional banking systems
[03:30:15] <jonp> bomb: HELL NO
[03:30:23] <Nasp> I really dont like crypto
[03:30:23] <jonp> they're a pyramid scheme
[03:30:27] <JakeSays> there is no better system than a market economy
[03:30:33] <Nasp> Pyramid schema and used for way too much illegal shit
[03:30:37] <brianonymous> but i am also a believer that as long as humans are involved, ANY system weaves its way into corruption at some point.
[03:30:39] <jonp> JakeSays:  a market economy with guard rails?
[03:30:56] <bomb> jonp most are, I'm talking about the idea. check out Polkadot, Cardano, Solana
[03:31:00] <JakeSays> that's.. a market economy
[03:31:03] <jonp> 'course, then you need to figure out what those "guard rails" *are*
[03:31:05] <bomb> rest is speculation machines basically
[03:31:46] <Nasp> Regarding Tesla, are tesla that much a game changer?
[03:31:59] <jonp> maybe?
[03:32:02] <jonp> probably not?
[03:32:03] <JakeSays> Nasp: most definitely
[03:32:24] <JakeSays> Nasp: if not for tesla we wouldn't have the EV momentum we currently have
[03:32:28] <brianonymous> for perhaps a few things
[03:32:35] <jonp> "the game" is changing, but will it change in a way that most of the current car manufacturers die off?
[03:32:37] <jonp> eh
[03:32:41] <JakeSays> we'd have the traditional automakers dragging their feet
[03:32:50] <jonp> JakeSays: i'm *glad* we have Tesla, and increasing EV momentum
[03:32:53] <jonp> don't get me wrong.
[03:32:54] <brianonymous> one we take for granted - in the 80s if you told me we would have self driving cars, i would have laughed
[03:33:06] <brianonymous> but that shit just snuck right in?
[03:33:08] <bomb> we had self driving cars in the 80s
[03:33:15] <JakeSays> brianonymous: dude.. knight rider. DUH
[03:33:16] <Nasp> I'm still not sure if we will get self driving cars soon
[03:33:18] <jonp> but i don't really see any existing automaker going out of business
[03:33:22] <brianonymous> of course, KITT
[03:33:27] <bomb> lol
[03:33:33] <Nasp> But they may have pushed it a bit in changing the industry, but the others can probably easily catch up
[03:33:34] <jonp> brianonymous: thank you, michael
[03:33:40] <JakeSays> jonp: no. of course they won't
[03:34:01] <Nasp> I still find EV's a joke
[03:34:10] <Nasp> We can't find a common charge plug for phones or cars
[03:34:12] <brianonymous> yeah, not out of business.. instead they adapted to competition
[03:34:17] <Nasp> Gasolin still works in any car
[03:34:24] <JakeSays> Nasp: not mine
[03:34:27] <Nasp> Not ling some have star shaped holes in the tank, and others round and squared
[03:34:28] <jonp> Nasp: there's a common charge plug: Tesla's, and everyone elses
[03:34:28] <bomb> now I can't stop playing the Knight Rider theme music in my mind
[03:34:30] <bomb> now I can't stop playing the Knight Rider theme music in my mind
[03:34:33] <jonp> we're down to 2
[03:34:38] <Nasp> jonp:  Nah there's like 4-5 standards if i remember
[03:34:47] <jonp> i think there's been consolidation recently
[03:34:50] <Nasp> But most variants also have a DC variant
[03:35:17] <Nasp> I think the plug and communication between car and charger should be standardized
[03:35:23] <JakeSays> tesla opening its stations to other makers will really motivate standard plugs
[03:35:27] <jonp> Nasp: eventually, sure
[03:36:09] <brianonymous> and then one day, tesla accidently shat out a space company
[03:36:18] <jonp> Nasp: kinda/sorta see also the EU idea of "standardizing on USB-C for smart phones"
[03:36:23] <jonp> that'll be a debacle
[03:36:28] <jonp> USB-C is already a debacle
[03:36:35] <Nasp> EU haven't succeeded in that yet
[03:36:41] <jonp> fortunately
[03:36:41] <Nasp> Apple still find ways around it
[03:36:44] <jonp> but they're working on it
[03:36:50] <Nasp> Been working on it for 10 years :d
[03:36:52] <jonp> wait for the next iPhone to have NO PORTS
[03:36:58] <Nasp> Maybe in next century we will have a standard
[03:37:00] <jonp> Nasp:  and if they'd been successful!?!
[03:37:04] <jonp> micro-usb?!
[03:37:06] <jonp> omfg
[03:37:13] <Nasp> That was a different time
[03:37:13] <JakeSays> brianonymous: lol not tesla. musk
[03:37:20] <brianonymous> yeah :D
[03:37:24] <JakeSays> brianonymous: i'm pretty sure spacex came first
[03:37:25] <jonp> Nasp: i don't think those involved agree?
[03:37:45] <brianonymous> yer prolly right. i actually dont know the history there
[03:38:11] <JakeSays> musk started spacex right after paypal and then invested in tesla
[03:38:41] <bomb> JakeSays you'd like Tesla's wife
[03:38:57] <JakeSays> bomb: huh?
[03:39:12] <bomb> not terribly tall but skinny in a cute way
[03:39:15] <bomb> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9SGYBHY0qs
[03:39:27] <JakeSays> bomb: tesla is a company. they don't have wives
[03:39:31] <bomb> I think she broke up with Tesla
[03:39:44] <bomb> just like how Avril divorced from Nickelback
[03:39:54] <Nasp> Man multi target compiles suuuuck
[03:39:55] <JakeSays> and musk and grimes were never married
[03:40:06] <bomb> wow
[03:40:06] <JakeSays> and i don't find grimes attractive
[03:40:09] <bomb> just WOW
[03:40:34] <bomb> and people act anal about me sharing the news about gigi and zayn
[03:40:41] <jonp> can we drop that topic, please?
[03:40:47] <bomb> here we have JakeSays following Elon Musk like Kardashians
[03:41:06] <bomb> jonp yes we can, gigi and zayn aren't a thing anymore. I hope your happy.
[03:41:21] <Nasp> I still have no diea who the fuck those people are
[03:41:44] <JakeSays> bomb: i don't follow musk. i just read the news.
[03:42:53] <bomb> holy shit Beatles sold 1.6 billion singles in the US alone, and 177 million albums
[03:42:56] <bomb> that's a lot of money
[03:43:16] <jonp> uh, yeah? that happened decades ago?
[03:43:31] <jonp> the Beatles were popular. Film at 11, circa 50 years ago
[03:43:35] <bomb> of course, but 1.6 bil damn
[03:44:03] <bomb> how much they would receive per single? $1 too much?
[03:44:35] <bomb> $1 in 1960s is $10 today
[03:45:22] <jonp> i wanted to say that was wrong, but it isn't far off?  wow: https://www.usinflationcalculator.com
[03:46:02] <JakeSays> the beatles is still the greatest selling artist of all time
[03:46:17] <jonp> and they're still fucking awesome
[03:46:22] <jonp> time to re-listen to the White Album
[03:46:30] <brianonymous> and they did it over the course of like 64 to 68
[03:46:48] <JakeSays> yeah
[03:47:06] <JakeSays> i wonder how many times they got laid in those four years
[03:47:08] <jonp> i also need to watch Get Back
[03:47:09] <brianonymous> thats the part that blows my mind. how prolific they were for the timeframe
[03:47:11] *** Quits: sfields (~sfields@2605:a601:adea:7a00:62a8:213c:2e:d0da) (Remote host closed the connection)
[03:47:20] <JakeSays> brianonymous: definitely
[03:47:25] <brianonymous> get back was great, it really personified them to me, and im a huge fan
[03:47:37] <bomb> Paul McCartney has a net worth of $1.2 bil
[03:47:47] <JakeSays> yup
[03:47:55] <JakeSays> he also puts on a good show
[03:48:02] <bomb> he's great
[03:48:12] <brianonymous> Get Back made me feel bad for Paul
[03:48:20] <brianonymous> at least for the time recorded
[03:49:20] <bomb> holy shit man. Beatles lived as a band like 10 years, and they managed to score billions of dollars
[03:49:43] <bomb> music is really profitable once you become a rock star.
[03:50:09] <jonp> bomb: but is it as profitable as, say, Amazon?
[03:50:15] <jonp> or Facebook? Microsoft? etc., etc.?
[03:50:45] <jonp> even Jack Dorsey is worth north of $3 billion
[03:52:10] <bomb> comparing apples and pantyhose
[03:53:08] <jonp> yes…
[03:53:37] <Nasp> Speaking of Amazon, Bezos seems to be as hated as people like Musk
[03:54:35] <bomb> everyone hates tech billionaires, nobody stops posting on Instagram
[03:54:40] <BSaboia> bomb, music back then was the winner-takes-it-all to the extreme
[03:55:00] <bomb> BSaboia not much different today
[03:55:06] <BSaboia> The Beatles were famous and rich, but 99.9999% of the bands wouldn't be even close
[03:55:19] <BSaboia> bomb, well, true. But today you are more likely to hear about the average random joe than before
[03:55:34] <Nasp> ahh fuck i accidentially ran a clean
[03:55:39] <BSaboia> In the 60's, it was on the radio or nowhere else
[03:56:13] <bomb> BSaboia companies couldn't own thousands of radio stations in the 60s. each has unique playlists
[03:56:17] <jonp> BSaboia: yes, but at the same time, there was far less radio consolidation in the 60's
[03:56:29] <jonp> most of the consolidation happened in the 90's
[03:56:37] <jonp> which arguably ruined the music industry
[03:56:37] <bomb> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_Act_of_1996
[03:56:43] <bomb> yeah
[03:56:56] <jonp> now like one company owns most radio stations
[03:57:11] <BSaboia> jonp, yes, but for instance, you could hear Beatles on the radio in Brazil during the 60's
[03:57:14] <bomb> yup. and they're running the same top 40 crap over and over again on ALL their stations
[03:57:20] <jonp> BSaboia: that's Brazil ;-)
[03:57:23] <BSaboia> But none of, say, the Chilean talent of back then
[03:57:34] <brianonymous> jonp: 2 :D
[03:57:43] <bomb> you could buy a bigger tuner :P
[03:58:00] <BSaboia> bomb, some people could, yeah
[03:58:24] <BSaboia> But if everyone could, The Beatles wouldn't be that rich
[03:58:41] <Nasp> Or like one company owns all buildings for rent :D
[03:58:45] <bomb> but  Beatles was also a bunch of talented motherfuckers
[03:58:50] <jonp> Nasp: We?
[03:58:53] <BSaboia> There's a cool explanation about this by Nassim Taleb on his book The Black Swan
[03:59:08] <Nasp> jonp:  Can't remember their name
[03:59:09] <BSaboia> bomb, there are many as talented (or even more) who couldn't be famous
[03:59:23] <jonp> Nasp: likely https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeWork
[03:59:41] <Nasp> I was thinking Blackstone
[03:59:53] <bomb> BSaboia of course. I was just saying Beatles weren't the Britney Spears or Miley Circus of the era
[03:59:59] <BSaboia> For instance, have you heard of Mutantes?
[04:00:02] <BSaboia> Ah, OK
[04:00:16] <bomb> Mutantes, no. they good?
[04:01:58] <BSaboia> bomb, IMHO, yes: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Os_Mutantes
[04:03:40] <bomb> sorry man my Portuguese is a little rusty
[04:04:23] <Nasp> bomb:  Btw did you quit and get social security for 10 dollars a day?
[04:04:48] <BSaboia> bomb, heh. But that's English wikipedia
[04:04:48] <BSaboia> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za5dpZrNBlw
[04:04:49] <bomb> Nasp social security is not tied to jobs here
[04:05:36] <bomb> BSaboia nice tune. did they ever release an English album?
[04:05:39] <BSaboia> But this is also something interesting. The fact that The Beatles were speaking english after WWII consolidated English as the universal language helped them a lot (and a bunch of others)
[04:05:49] <BSaboia> bomb, I don't know if an entire album. But some songs are in English
[04:05:58] <bomb> well, yeah. Beatles were lucky being English
[04:06:20] <BSaboia> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syqJAgTQdlU
[04:06:32] *** Quits: Tobbi (~Tobbi@2a02:8108:1240:48ec:21a3:4bf2:b994:55b1) (Quit: My MacBook has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[04:06:32] <BSaboia> This is also from the 1960's, in Brazil
[04:06:53] <bomb> cool
[04:07:04] <bomb> right time, wrong place
[04:07:11] <BSaboia> I believe that this guy (Tim Maia) would've been world famous if he was born in the US
[04:07:19] <JakeSays> Nasp: that's because bezos is a dick
[04:07:33] <bomb> only popular in a 200-million country
[04:08:05] <Nasp> bomb:  What do you mean tied to jobs?
[04:08:08] <bomb> BSaboia that I disagree. world is full of bands mimicking the US & UK sounds
[04:08:13] <Nasp> As in you get social security no matter what
[04:08:26] <bomb> Nasp yeah, like Europ
[04:09:48] <BSaboia> bomb, true, but there's Bossa Nova which is also mimicked elsewhere
[04:09:56] <Nasp> bomb:  Like citizens salary?
[04:09:58] <JakeSays> jonp: lol wework. that guy is a piece of work
[04:10:20] <jonp> on the one hand, YES, but on the other hand…. wow, right place, right time, nearly made out like a bandit
[04:10:36] <jonp> kinda gotta admire the hustle
[04:10:43] <JakeSays> jonp: HE did make out like a bandit. no one else did though.
[04:10:46] <jonp> right
[04:10:48] <jonp> exactly
[04:10:52] <JakeSays> he's a total fraud
[04:11:00] <jonp> but if you make bank as a fraud…
[04:11:07] <jonp> (see also anything crypto ;-)
[04:11:31] <JakeSays> crypto isn't a fraud
[04:11:42] <jonp> lots of fraud is just built atop it, that's all
[04:11:49] <jonp> oh, and the money laundering
[04:12:07] <Nasp> I just saw another around of blockchain hype
[04:12:11] <BSaboia> bomb, but I do agree. A lot of people trying
[04:12:28] <JakeSays> jonp: that's not the fault of crypto
[04:12:46] <jonp> JakeSays: when crypto was explicitly DESIGNED to make money laundering easy…
[04:12:52] <jonp> by going "no barriers! no barriers!"
[04:13:06] <jonp> "we don't want no stinking government oversight! that's bad!"
[04:13:12] <JakeSays> jonp: that wasn't the goal of crypto. it's just a side effect.
[04:13:21] <jonp> it's part of the design fallout then
[04:13:27] <jonp> kinda hard to differentiate between them
[04:13:46] <JakeSays> no, it's pretty easy to differentiate between them.
[04:14:20] <JakeSays> bad actors be bad actors, regardless.
[04:14:53] <jonp> bad actors with (effectively) nothing to stop them is a different animal
[04:15:02] <jonp> deliberately so
[04:15:09] <brianonymous> i have 2 main issues with crypto - intrinsic value, which i guess is in the eye of the beholder a bit, and the fact that i dont think there is a platform good enough to compete with the current financial systems, like in speed
[04:15:16] <jonp> either because they didn't think about the existence of bad actors
[04:15:17] <jonp> or didn't care
[04:15:20] <Nasp> Crypto is too fucking shaky
[04:15:20] <brianonymous> full disclosure - i own crypto
[04:15:48] <JakeSays> jonp: i'm sure they didn't care. which is fine.
[04:15:55] <brianonymous> but i own it cuz its so volitile!!
[04:15:59] <bomb> Nasp nah just free healthcare. retirement plan requires having a job
[04:16:03] <JakeSays> brianonymous: i have almost 2 million coins
[04:16:16] <Nasp> bomb:  Ohh so no money?
[04:16:18] <brianonymous> i got 17 million SHIBUs, lol
[04:16:28] <JakeSays> brianonymous: LOL thats what i have as well
[04:16:37] <JakeSays> but i cut myself off at $80
[04:16:58] <brianonymous> my biggest allocation is ltc
[04:17:03] <JakeSays> i'm sure it's up to $40 by now. lol
[04:18:09] <brianonymous> but i wont lie, the main value i see is just the fact that its coupled to USD
[04:19:11] <brianonymous> and 5%-10% swings are like a normal week
[04:19:19] <bomb> Nasp not at all. if we had citizen salary thing, it would be peanuts anyway.
[04:19:30] <bomb> literally peanuts
[04:20:36] <Nasp> bomb:  Then where do you get that money from?
[04:20:40] *** Quits: fredrikhr (~fredrikhr@195.204.172.170) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[04:20:47] <Nasp> Here social security are tied to a job, but healthcares free
[04:20:51] <Nasp> Or well not tied to a job really
[04:20:54] <Nasp> The opposite really
[04:21:47] <bomb> Nasp companies pay for the healthcare, but not retirement plan?
[04:22:00] <Nasp> Companies pay for nothing
[04:22:24] <Nasp> I get salary, from my salary tax is deducted which gives healthcare and retirement
[04:22:31] <Nasp> Also from my salary is deducted money to my retirement plan
[04:22:39] <bomb> well, basically the same, then
[04:23:05] <JakeSays> brianonymous: if shibu ever hits $1 i'm gonna sell
[04:23:13] <bomb> when you're unemployed, it's cheap healthcare
[04:23:16] <brianonymous> JakeSays: lol, hell yeah
[04:23:23] <Roughy> people love round numbers, everyone will sell just before.
[04:23:45] <brianonymous> but unless they do a lot of burning, i dont see it going past 0.001
[04:23:54] <JakeSays> Roughy: if it's going up people will ride it as far as they can. they won't stop at $1
[04:23:55] <brianonymous> and thats optimism
[04:24:14] <JakeSays> $.001 would still be a decent payout
[04:24:29] <brianonymous> shibu supply is just way too fucking large
[04:24:41] <bomb> Nasp basically me: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwIEUflY6YI
[04:25:26] <Nasp> Are you the guy stealing the camera, or the sexworker?
[04:26:04] <bomb> I'm the WHORE nasp
[04:26:12] <bomb> except I make much less than her
[04:26:42] <Nasp> Great only 4600 compile errors
[04:26:52] <bomb> let me fix all of them for $10
[04:27:32] <Nasp> If you can i'll pay you 10 times that
[04:30:09] <bomb> holy shit that's $100
[04:30:17] * bomb drops his calculator
[04:34:11] <JakeSays> Nasp: someone is stealing a sex worker?
[04:34:17] <Nasp> haha
[04:34:23] <Nasp> That's funny
[04:34:55] <Nasp> Might be down to 19 compile errors, or vs is just behind with the count
[04:35:11] <brianonymous> it lied to me too
[04:35:24] <brianonymous> i think it just gives up on life and the pain within
[04:35:41] <bomb> stop taking my job lol
[04:35:47] <JakeSays> "me so hooooony"
[04:36:25] <bomb> JakeSays https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmSH7PZduYw

[04:36:59] <JakeSays> "Disabled the comments because you idiots kept spamming it with racist bullshit." lol
[04:37:15] <brianonymous> lol
[04:37:44] <Nasp> ahh yes there we go 4600 compile errors are back
[04:38:23] <brianonymous> \o/
[04:38:26] <JakeSays> Nasp: what are you building
[04:39:05] <Nasp> I just tried a hack to add SDK support to a non SDK project by making it reference a SDK project and move all the dependency definitions to there
[04:39:09] <Nasp> But it's not exactly happy about it
[04:39:19] <brianonymous> the best ones are the reference errors that vaporize 200 at a time
[04:39:22] <JakeSays> company christmas present to employees this year: a beanie. wtf
[04:39:34] <Nasp> It should work because it works like that already, but moving all the dependencies is quite messy
[04:40:49] <Nasp> I'm only doing it because the non sdk based project makes anything nuget take 5-10 minutes

[05:14:58] *** Joins: Advant (Advant@user/advant)
[05:16:02] <Advant> If I have MyFunc(out object myobjref){}   that is being called from Native code, is there a way to verify the reference isn't a null reference in managed code?
[05:16:34] <MizMahem> hmm... should I just handle this RLE as a string of chars, or should I drop down to the byte level. Hmm.
[05:16:35] <jonp> Advant: uh…is this a COM function, or a P/Invoke?
[05:16:42] <jonp> 'cause i don't see how you can use `object` in a P/Invoke
[05:16:57] <Advant> jonp:  Native calling this function
[05:17:02] <Advant> not other way around
[05:17:12] <jonp> native via COM or native via delegate via P/Invoke?
[05:17:18] <jonp> *how* is native calling it?
[05:17:19] <Advant> delegate
[05:17:30] <jonp> right, then *how* are you using `object`?
[05:17:40] <jonp> and expecting it to work "reasonably"?
[05:17:42] <Advant> jonp:  it isn't my code calling it...
[05:17:56] <jonp> what *native* type do you expect the native caller to get?
[05:18:14] <Advant> I just threw object in, but its a specific type
[05:18:20] <jonp> oh.  good.
[05:18:23] <Advant> But I have no way to handle a null reference
[05:18:42] <jonp> indeed.  so don't.
[05:19:20] <Advant> why do you say that
[05:19:31] <MizMahem> hmm, if I treat the run length encoding as just like char values... hmm... I could have them all be negative values. That would almost certainly avoid a op-code overlap, and would probably offer me more run length encoded then I would ever really need hmm...
[05:23:13] <jonp> Advant: because if native code passes NULL, then you'll get a SIGSEGV
[05:23:36] <jonp> and unless you have NO testing at all, it'll be kinda hard to miss that in testing.
[05:24:44] <jonp> and as errors go, SIGSEGV is *nice*, 'cause it's kinda hard to miss, and you're not randomly overwriting data "elsewhere" in the process.
[05:24:56] <jonp> (or injecting code via JNDI & LDAP…)
[05:25:39] <Advant> jonp:  sorry, I'm running it as a MonoPINvokeCallback, and I suspect in the original method they natively check for a nullptr
[05:25:57] <Advant> Since I am hooking the original method
[05:26:46] <Advant> I don't any way to verify the out param in managed code is valid...
[05:26:57] <jonp> then maybe they're using unsafe code & `(&myobjref) == null`?
[05:27:15] <sysRPL> is anyone here familiar with ki9a's remobject oxygene compiler?
[05:27:28] <jonp> and in general, that's by design; it isn't possible to pass `null` as the "target" of a ref or out param.
[05:27:32] <jonp> the C# compiler doesn't allow it
[05:27:32] <sysRPL> i noticed it costs $
[05:27:40] <jonp> Reflection "fixes" it.
[05:27:58] <jonp> you gotta go out of your way to avoid the safety measures
[05:28:02] <sysRPL> i was windering if they ever intend to make a free but fully functional version
[05:29:12] <jonp> i'm gonna guess… why should they?
[05:29:28] <sysRPL> i am not quite sure i understand how charging people to rely upon ssas and very lesser know compiler to build dotnet projects works in the minds of potential customers
[05:29:46] <Advant> jonp:  yeah compiled complains about me doing anything with it before its assigned, but assignment throws the exception, a bit of chicken egg :/
[05:29:50] <Advant> compiler
[05:29:53] <sysRPL> or saas
[05:30:07] <jonp> Advant: that's where unsafe + `&` comes in
[05:31:19] <Advant> jonp:  Getting a compile error, You can only take the address of an unfixed expression inside of a fixed statement initializer
[05:31:49] <Advant> heh, should have mentioned its a struct ref not and object ref :/
[05:34:18] <jonp> yeah, important, so go with what the compiler suggests
[05:34:42] <jonp> fixed (StructName* p = &myobjref) { if (p == null) { it's null! } }
[05:35:12] <jonp> but again, do you actually need to check for this?
[05:37:09] <sysRPL> no
[05:37:20] <sysRPL> p will never be null in that code
[05:37:37] <jonp> in normal code, correct
[05:37:46] <jonp> but if you have a native caller calling that code… then maybe
[05:38:08] <sysRPL> you are getting the address of a variable
[05:38:10] <Advant> jonp:  awesome, thanks!  helps me troubleshoot further :)
[05:38:33] <sysRPL> a variable will never have a null address
[05:38:42] <jonp> until it does. :-)
[05:40:31] <Advant> I'll let you know either way what I find out
[05:40:53] <sysRPL> i was pondering c versus pascal pointer usage earleir this morning, and pascal makes pointers much more clear even though they describe the same things
[05:41:21] <sysRPL> typicall because in pascal you use more types, including typing pointers
[05:41:43] <sysRPL> plus pascal auto dereferences for you
[05:43:15] <sysRPL> in pascal that would be ... var P: PStructName; begin P := @MyObjRef; ...
[05:43:43] <sysRPL> @ vs & ... where @ in pascal means address of
[05:44:34] <sysRPL> to me @ is a bit more clear than &

[06:36:28] <MizMahem> hmm, if I use a format of like `char`, `ushort` that will have the advantage of being trivally serializable. And a `ushort` should be more than long enough to encode any likely run. However, if I also wanted to use it to encode jump locations, it is remotely possible that I could have a string longer than `ushort` Hmm...

[12:42:05] <MatthiasVance> Kim^J: It is 1 -> 1

[13:06:09] <Nasp> Then only my server will be able to resolve it

[13:07:54] <fredrikhr> ap5[work], doesn't the secondary only come into play if the primary is not reachable? E.g. if the primary says not resolvable, the secondary is not asked?

[13:09:18] <ap5[work]> fredrikhr that is router specific, how that is implemented, i think. That is why the Internet recommend having only one Primary, and let that do upstream resolving
[13:09:54] <fredrikhr> ap5[work], what does windows do?
[13:09:55] <ap5[work]> Nasp, i have installed pihole on my rpi, and i have not done any config what so ever to get it to work. Only the hosts file update.
[13:10:16] <ap5[work]> fredrikhr, the primary DNS i am talking about is on the router

[13:12:02] <fredrikhr> when does Windows ask the secondary DNS? If primary times out? If primary says not resolvable, if primary is not routable?
[13:12:15] <Nasp> I'd wish the windows hostfile had wildcard support by default
[13:12:39] <Nasp> Also am i the only one who alwayys found it confusing mapping an IP address -> DNS in a hostfile
[13:12:45] <Nasp> I kinda want it to be the other way around

[13:30:09] <Kim^J> MatthiasVance: That is, it's powerful, have lots of features you want in a bigger network setting, but fairly easy to use
[13:30:11] <Nasp> The unify setup seems nice with the controller part
[13:30:17] <Nasp> Just plug in a new network device and let them auto discover
[13:30:37] <Nasp> Although i only went with it for wifi since i found their switches and routers a bit too expensive
[13:30:49] <Nasp> Also for some reason Ubiquity have begun removing features from their products
[13:30:54] <Nasp> So you update it and shits gone
[13:31:11] <Kim^J> Which features?
[13:31:18] <Kim^J> ap5[work]: NOOOOOO
[13:31:23] <Kim^J> ap5[work]: CoreDNS, *AVOID*

[13:32:18] <Nasp> Kim^J:  Well i dont know exactly, but my friend who had it who helped me set mine up was a bit surprised when he clicke around the UI and said stuff was missing

[13:32:49] <Kim^J> Ah, features aren't missing, they aren't available in the new UI, but you can switch back
[13:32:53] <ap5[work]> Nasp, i have ubiquity AmpliFI, but that is just a simple consumer mesh. It works fine, but you cant expand with more gadgets, other than more slaves
[13:33:06] <Kim^J> Nasp: Because etcd is royal fucking pain in the arse.
[13:33:16] <Nasp> CoreDNS doesn't require etcd
[13:33:25] <Nasp> You can use it with etcd
[13:33:46] <Nasp> Isnt etcd or any of the other distributed stores a pain?
[13:34:09] <Kim^J> Nasp: Last time I checked it, it sort of required etcd, because ome features weren't available on other backends
[13:34:24] <Nasp> When i tested it worked fine without

[13:36:51] <MatthiasVance> Kim^J: Nice, thanks. Will definitely consider it.
[13:37:37] <Kim^J> MatthiasVance: What you should aim for, is something with a real wifi-controller, so that you can seamlessly move between APs
[13:37:53] <Nasp> I bought the Unify Wifi 6 LR
[13:37:53] <Kim^J> Unifi does this and so does other vendors.
[13:38:23] <Kim^J> I'm not sure about things like asus, linksys, etc. that are aimed towards the SOHO-market
[13:38:41] <Nasp> I find so many people just buying a random shit router and plug it in
[13:38:51] <Nasp> Then when they need to over a bigger area of the house they bug 1-2 more
[13:38:58] <ap5[work]> Why buy new?
[13:39:07] <Nasp> more coverage
[13:39:17] <ap5[work]> Then  Unify Wifi 6 LR is a good choice :)

[13:39:47] <Kim^J> ap5[work]: Actually, no. Range also depends on the client, not only the AP
[13:39:47] <Nasp> Wifi 6 isn't mesh
[13:39:58] <Nasp> Unify 6
[13:40:06] <Nasp> It actually depends more on the client
[13:40:28] <Nasp> Most devices today have poor antennas
[13:40:33] <Kim^J> Heck, it's often better to use more APs with less power than using few APs with high power
[13:40:59] <ap5[work]> Ok
[13:41:18] <Kim^J> Even more important when using 2.4GHz, because you only have three effective channels to choose from
[13:41:24] <Kim^J> 2.4GHz mesh is the worst.
[13:46:38] <Nasp> I've never understood mesh
[13:46:43] <Nasp> Repeaters on repeaters
[13:46:52] <Kim^J> Nasp: No, repeaters is a different thing
[13:46:57] <ap5[work]> Isnt that different?
[13:47:06] <Nasp> Isn't mesh usually a repeater
[13:47:10] <ap5[work]> No
[13:47:14] <Nasp> You add 5 aps with no ethernet between them
[13:47:16] <Kim^J> A mesh uses a dedicated channel to talk to the main AP
[13:47:27] <Kim^J> Nasp: No, mesh and repeaters are different
[13:47:36] <ap5[work]> It tells the client which point is the best
[13:47:43] <Kim^J> A repeater doesn't have a dedicated channel back to the main AP
[13:48:20] <Kim^J> It just takes the existing frequency and sends it back out, but with more power
[13:49:38] <Kim^J> Whereas the mesh APs uses a wireless "cable" to the main AP.
[13:49:57] <Miles8of9> if i create a transaction while using a dbcontext in a thread, does it count if i try to create another transaction on another thread on another dbcontext.... but on the same db??
[13:50:04] <Kim^J> So main AP can be channel 1, mesh AP can be channel 11, and the mesh AP talks to the main AP via channel 6.
[13:50:08] <Kim^J> (Assuming 2.4GHz)
[13:50:30] <Kim^J> Miles8of9: Count?

[13:53:38] <ap5[work]> That depends :)
[13:54:40] <ap5[work]> If you want to have atomicity on the things that is in the transaction eg, if you want all of it to happen, or nothing (and maybe you dont want others to see what is being updated): then you want a transaction
[13:54:44] <Kim^J> Miles8of9: Well, normally, no, no need for transactions
[13:55:21] <Nasp> Yes create and destroy after each operation
[13:55:26] <Kim^J> But if you want to stage change X, then Y, then Z, and fail all of them if any fails, then yes, you need a transaction
[13:55:38] <Kim^J> Nasp: That's the the best way either

[16:26:38] <moose> MatthiasVance: Oh that's a good one
[16:27:02] <MatthiasVance> Also seen someone mention SMS providers, so anything that sends you an SMS message
[16:27:05] <MatthiasVance> Reply back with the string, et voila
[16:27:18] <MatthiasVance> Or changing the name of your iPhone or Tesla ..
[16:27:42] <moose> I was auditing something related to phones recently around it :)
[16:28:03] <moose> Can confirm, cell phone "signal boosters" are quite fragile haha
[16:28:22] <moose> I am sure tons of wifi access points are too.
[16:28:45] <moose> UniFi released patches already, same with Cisco, etc
[16:29:07] <MatthiasVance> Ah yeah
[16:29:23] <moose> sysRPL: Also your cache stuff still supports TLS 1.1
[16:29:24] <MatthiasVance> I was actually looking at something like Nest Wifi
[16:29:25] <moose> Should disable it.
[16:29:36] <MatthiasVance> But I like to have tons of control / features :P
[16:29:51] <moose> MatthiasVance: I really like Ubiquity stuff for home office.
[16:30:06] <sysRPL> moose: the cache stuff = cloudfront
[16:30:09] <MatthiasVance> moose: Yeah that's what Kim^J recommended as well
[16:30:15] <moose> I have the Unifi access points and the edgerouter for my camera network
[16:30:32] <moose> Then Cisco ASA and ASR1001-X for the edge
[16:30:35] <MatthiasVance> If I'm spending that much money I would expect at least 10Gbps :p
[16:30:49] <moose> I get over 700 mbps on my phone in my house
[16:30:52] <MatthiasVance> Me too
[16:30:54] <moose> and I do run a 10 gbps network
[16:31:30] <MatthiasVance> ah, but the home stuff doesn't do 10Gbps right
[16:31:33] <MatthiasVance> "just" 1 Gbps
[16:32:48] <moose> So their edgerouter supports 10 gbps, which is a sort of "enthusiast and soho or small branch office" kind of router.
[16:33:10] <moose> But you would need a 10 gbps switch that supports SFP+
[16:33:29] <moose> You'll come off of the router via fiber to the switch and then to 10GE
[16:33:30] * canton7 is a big fan of edgerouter
[16:33:42] <moose> Yeah, edgerouter is pretty great
[16:34:11] <moose> It's the only router that didn't melt/exhibit serious bugs/actually brick with my internet research projects with masscan :)
[16:34:24] <moose> Even Cisco stuff isn't as reliable, in my experience.
[16:40:17] <sysRPL> okay i updated some cloudfront settings including setting the security protocol to TLSv1.2_2021
[16:40:52] <sysRPL> i guess i should also invalidate all the cache
[16:41:15] <moose> Hey, glad I could help point things out :D

[16:44:24] <moose> They could forge a redirect to a malicious site, they could intercept any credentials if you add authentication some day.
[16:45:02] <moose> A lot of people will say things like "That requires someone like the NSA or FSB to man in the middle it!" and the answer is no, you're in a shared datacenter and so anyone sitting there in the same pod is potentially malicious.

[16:47:03] <sysRPL> it might be a namecheap problem though
[16:47:20] <moose> It looks like an AWS issue honestly, or some proxy serving the wrong certs
[16:47:41] <moose> If you don't know the domain I mentioned before, corexy.page or whatever, then it's probably a bad config on a proxy/lb

[16:48:01] <moose> had that confusion the other day in a meeting funny enough
[16:48:23] <sysRPL> if someone even thought of lady boy, then they have issues
[16:48:37] <moose> It's a common term used in south asia
[16:49:06] <moose> I have network-wide TLS enforcement and deep packet inspection stuff that blocks insecure connectivity from everything, so it's tripping up on that for your site.
[16:49:16] <moose> Most people probably just see a "warning this site is insecure" message
[16:50:03] <moose> And we saw earlier, it's not just me. The Qualys SSL test shows it's completely broken.
[16:51:36] <sysRPL> i also use letsencrypt for the iis side

[16:56:03] <sysRPL> okay well i am out of ideas
[16:56:27] <moose> Lets see if there's any difference in the cert at all
[16:56:36] <sysRPL> so much for that stuipid microsoft "to the cloud" ad campaign
[16:57:02] <moose> It's still serving an expired *.corexy.page cert
[16:57:43] <moose> It's in the 2nd part of the cert chain, not the primary cert
[16:57:44] <sysRPL> nothing of that page relates to corexy.page
[16:57:59] <moose> Can you update the installed cert chain?
[16:58:02] <sysRPL> okay i think it's a winacme / iis problem then
[17:00:21] <moose> sysRPL: Do you run multiple things on this box?
[17:00:25] <moose> in your IIS config
[17:00:58] <moose> SSL Labs makes it a bit confusing, it may actually just be serving two distinct certs.
[17:01:30] <moose> Yes, confirmed. It's two cert paths.
[17:02:10] <sysRPL> try once more
[17:02:11] <moose> The main cert for www.getlazarus.org has the entire chain and it's fine.
[17:02:22] <sysRPL> i issue a new cert for that defunct domain

[17:02:43] <sysRPL> oh
[17:02:45] <moose> Maybe turn on SNI
[17:02:59] <moose> And see if you have a cert for that domain that's not in use somewhere and remove it
[17:03:04] <moose> It's quite expired, 5 months or more
[17:03:52] <moose> In your site binding you should be able to specify the certificate and require server name indication

[17:10:37] <moose> What are your TLS settings on IIS? Are you just supporting 1.2 or also everything else?
[17:11:19] <moose> Confirmed cert is good now, only seeing one. But it's a cipher suite mismatch in TLS 1.2
[17:12:05] <moose> You need to add the TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 suite at least.
