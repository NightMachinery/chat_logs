[06:56:22] <Crocodillian> how do I find a good game to play
[07:02:57] <Carbonflux> i am almost tempted to type that into google just to see what kind of upselling scams emerge heh.
[07:03:29] <Carbonflux> i find that the ratings on Steam seem to be fairly good normally.
[07:04:36] <Carbonflux> normally i just browse around, also they have this suggestion tour you can do, i forget what its called.
[07:06:00] <Crocodillian> I just want something like talos or portal
[07:06:05] <Crocodillian> but I doubt there is anythiong
[07:11:15] <Crocodillian> but I dunno, maybe I should try something else
[07:11:37] <Crocodillian> the thing is, since I don't have a reward pathway, most normal games like shooting things and collecting experience points etc. etc. are no fun for me
[07:12:37] <Crocodillian> I could play a good RPG with a good story
[07:13:31] <Crocodillian> anything you'd recommend?
[07:15:29] <Crocodillian> or like a strategy game with a good story

[07:36:11] <Carbonflux> well, i don't really have a wide range of experience, i play bethesda games mostly, fallout, ESO, i have been playing the 10th anv edition of skyrim which has been fun. i really liked this Russian game Metro Exodus, did three play thrus, it has a calculation of "karma" that changes how the game ends.
[07:37:36] <Crocodillian> I've heard it mentioned, and I never played any fallout games yet, been meaning to do that
[07:43:33] <Carbonflux> i love fallout, i keep a play thru of fallout 4 going all the time and play a few hours a week, its a huge game with dozens of different outcomes, and the mod community keeps adding new content. It has a great story imo the requires you to always make imperfect choices. 
[07:44:24] <Carbonflux> i also like the combat in it.
[07:44:42] <Carbonflux> decent AI considering the context.
[07:45:04] <Carbonflux> i also like being able to build settlements.
[07:47:10] <Carbonflux> if you are going to play it, starting out i would recommend enabling the developers console, just google for fallout 4 console commands.
[07:58:13] <Crocodillian> Thanks for the info, maybe I'll try sometime, I'll probably start with 3.

[11:20:02] <Faux> RUST MEME
[11:25:47] <Renderwww> almost as good as linux memes
[11:26:04] <Renderwww> biggest problem is I don't understand over half of those strings
[11:27:08] <Renderwww> come to think of I don't understand any of it. All I remember from rusting is getting pissed at having to use one of those osstrings
[11:27:58] <Faux> Yeah, the ergonomics of OsString are shit.
[11:28:17] <Faux> Obviously it's on purpose; so you don't accidentally use it as a string in a way which would be INEFFICIENT.
[11:28:38] <Faux> Which is normally totally irrelevant because if you were dealing with the OS it's probably a filesystem so so shit slow copying between string types would be irrelevant anyway.
[11:29:06] <Faux> Also if we just shot every single OS person we could have utf-8 filesystems and then we also wouldn't have this problem.
[11:29:07] <Renderwww> how many bad things have ever happened because someone used a unicode string that wasn't proper unicode?
[11:29:21] <Renderwww> probably none
[11:29:57] <Faux> I mean, there's plenty of null termination bugs from re-interpreting utf-16 as utf-8 then null terminating.
[11:30:54] <Faux> Or does utf-16 use non-null pairs? I can't even remember because Id on't care.
[11:31:16] <Renderwww> but that can't happen if you just chop up and glue together char8 in illegal ways
[11:31:56] <Renderwww> so you only have to fix the utf-16 to utf-8 conversion and not pester everyone with an even stringonomics
[11:32:01] <Faux> char8* it can 'cos you're back to the null termination problem.
[11:32:41] <Faux> OsString#into_string() does the one-off anything-to-utf8 conversion!
[11:33:00] <Renderwww> and probably barfs when it can't?
[11:33:11] <Faux> It returns an error, yeah.
[11:35:25] <Faux> Not sure I know off-hand how to reinterpret-cast an OsString into a &[u8].
[11:35:57] <Renderwww> simple, write it in c and call the c function from rust

[11:40:55] <Faux> > users identify as characters may in general consist of a base code point and a sequence of combining characters (or might be a sequence of code points of some other kind, for example Hangul conjoining jamos

[11:41:21] <Renderwww> "users identify as characters" is that a new gender?

[15:13:59] <dukwon> start an indie rock band in the early 2000s
[15:15:50] <Carbonflux> now days? just about nothing, we have a lot of problems, most of down town is closed, homeless people everywhere, unless its the super rich, no one can afford to buy a home unless they have millions, we have defunded the police to the point where no crimes are punished and we have to defend ourselves. But Amazon is here. Also, its still a beautiful place physically, one of the few cold climate rain forests in 
[15:15:50] <Carbonflux> the world.
[15:16:48] <Carbonflux> ah an we have one of the biggest cancer research centers in the world.
[15:16:56] <Crocodillian> I went to the "rain forest" in Vancouver, it's a massive tourist trap, and just a bunch of fucking pine trees
[15:17:17] <Crocodillian> but technically a rain forest
[15:17:32] <Carbonflux> ya, Canadians, what can you do? 
[15:17:40] <Carbonflux> they all know martial arts tho.
[15:17:41] <Crocodillian> but seriously Vancouver is amazingly beautiful
[15:17:53] <Carbonflux> yup
[15:17:57] <Crocodillian> not the city itself but the views and the road to the mountains from it
[15:18:50] <Carbonflux> the whole pacific northwest is beautiful once you get away from the cities. 
[15:19:35] <Carbonflux> we have huge black crows as well.
[15:19:54] <Carbonflux> they have the same brain/body ratio as humans and live into their 70s

[15:20:37] <Crocodillian> I bet some ravens are much smarter than many government employees
[15:20:54] <Carbonflux> when i look into their eyes sometimes they seem wiser than me ;)
[15:21:19] <CaCode> Did you know squids are highly intelligent?
[15:21:30] <CaCode> along with parrots and dolphins?
[15:22:06] <Carbonflux> ya, some people think squids are a example of which Alien life might be like.
[15:23:08] <Carbonflux> also their intelligence can be distributed thru their body more
[15:23:25] <Carbonflux> they can control their bodies in ways we cannot.
[15:23:44] <Carbonflux> they really are amazing beings.
[15:23:55] <Crocodillian> I'm not sure a corvid's intelligence is comparable to that of a 4 year old human, they can solve very complex puzzles etc.
[15:24:24] <Carbonflux> they can use tools as well and recognize people in disguise. 
[15:24:42] <CaCode> https://www.nathab.com/blog/crows-are-as-intelligent-as-a-seven-year-old-child/
[15:25:10] <Carbonflux> also, they can speak if the are trained young and their tounges are altered.
[15:25:30] <Crocodillian> have you read about Alex the grey parrot
[15:25:42] <Carbonflux> i don't think that is a good metric, comparing them to human children
[15:25:54] <Crocodillian> yeah definitely not
[15:26:07] <Carbonflux> they make choices that are much wiser than any child
[15:26:45] <Carbonflux> i interact with them a lot and they are different, but not lesser, they "See" me.
