[21:22:38] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> @davidj361:matrix.org I guess most users use `SPC s s` instead (but I am not sure id maybe occur provides some extra features)
[21:24:05] <FromGitter> <davidj361:matrix.org> that's the same thing I wanted actually, but I don't know how to easily use helm like easiling skipping pages
[21:24:59] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> skipping pages? In pdf? In pdf there is `, s s`
[21:25:41] <FromGitter> <davidj361:matrix.org> i mean if i SPC s s there's a lot of results so it's hard to browse through. I know ctrl hjkl browses through helm, but how do you easily go to next page?
[21:26:43] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Ah... I am using Ivy (instead of Helm). But I guess at least `PgDown` should work
[21:27:11] <FromGitter> <davidj361:matrix.org> yeah but that's a pain, was looking for something vim like and quick. i'll just look for it
[21:27:39] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Also you could try to find the binding by typing `M-x helm next`... or maybe you can find in the Helm help menu
[21:27:51] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> You can also inspect the helm keymap using `SPC h d K`
[21:28:30] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> I guess there must be some bidning already... but otherwise you could configure one of course
[21:30:36] <FromGitter> <davidj361:matrix.org> apparently it's C-v and M-v
[21:31:19] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Ah okay... wel you can make your own keybindings of course
[21:32:00] <FromGitter> <davidj361:matrix.org> why ivy instead of helm?
[21:33:01] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Just a little easier to create my own functions... and somehow I think I like it better... but it is very similar
[21:33:35] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Helm is the default probably for a good reason
[21:35:04] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> There is a new competitor b.t.w. in the `compleseus` layer. But I think that new ecosystem is not yet well configured (not sure, I did not look at it for a few weeks)
[21:37:31] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> However, when it gets configured well, I guess it would become the 'best' choice (but configuring it well is quite a job)

[23:44:27] <FromGitter> <milochadam> @AreTaro This was an example, as to how to use `with-eval-after-load`, the inner part are my keybindings. In your case it would be: ‚èé  ‚èé ```code paste, see link``` ‚èé  ‚èé That is, if you want to overwrite it (let me know if it doesn't work for you, it may behave differently with my config when I'm testing). Keybindings are defined in different files, also depending on the package but you can inspect

[23:46:12] <FromGitter> <milochadam> @mathpunk yes, I noticed it recently too. I haven't had time to inspect it or find a fix for it but editing the tags in insert mode does the trick for now
[23:46:36] <FromGitter> <mathpunk> thanks! i would not have thought of that
[23:47:31] <FromGitter> <mathpunk> oh, interesting.... when entering edit mode, the buffer reacts like it's got the keybindings
[23:47:49] <FromGitter> <mathpunk> so when i started to type 'fixup' the 'f' sufficed and changed the tag
[23:48:11] <FromGitter> <mathpunk> i'm sure that would be useful fix information to someone who knows more than myself
