[22:03:52] <Guest87> Hello, I am trying to have a dynamic supervisor with several child processes of different kind. Everything is working well. I can add children, I have a manager process that is used to start the children. But now I want to let the rest of the application know whenever one of the children is restarted. From what I could find about it with some
[22:03:53] <Guest87> research, it looks that I would have to use a Registry (with the :listeners option) to have some tracking or try to use Phoenix.Presence for that part. The only thing I want to do is to call some code when a process is restarted (for notifications)
[22:04:42] <Guest87> (or killed/normally exiting for that matter..)
[22:10:27] <Guest87> It feels like I should go with Registry first .. (and see if it is enough); any thoughts? :-)

[22:13:13] <Nicd> thought: have the starting processes publish their PID with registry, listeners can know when they start. also manager can listen for that message and start monitoring them, then it will get a down message when they die and can publish that over the same registry

[22:25:17] <Guest87> Nicd: With the starting processes you mean using the registry don't you? So it would be a good idea to use the listeners option e.g. {Registry, keys: :unique, name: MyRegistry, listeners: [Manager]} and then have the Manager act on the messages it gets; and then (as you suggest) the manager could start monitoring them. What do you mean by "and can
[22:25:18] <Guest87> publish that over the same registry"?
[22:26:06] <Nicd> I don't know what the listeners option does
[22:26:21] <Nicd> registry can be used as pubsub and that's what I was saying
[22:26:43] <Nicd> the starting process can say "hello, I'm PID #5325" over it
[22:26:54] <Nicd> the manager can say "PID #5325 just died"
[22:28:21] <href> doesn't need a registry or pubsub, just send a message to the manager? which surely has a registred local name
[22:29:19] <href> but listeners: is fine, too.
[22:29:22] <Nicd> but they want the rest of the application to know
[22:29:31] <href> ooooh ok my bad :) I read too fast
[22:29:54] <href> so yeah the easy way sounds like to publish something on the process initialization for everyone to know

[22:40:48] <href> Guest87: if you need distributed/multi nodes, have a look at Phoenix PubSub.
[22:41:10] <Guest87> hopefully some day :P
