[13:36:42] <nomad_fr> I'm looking for a way to filter messages which are dmarc failled message with dovecot.
[13:37:22] <nomad_fr> I've test a rule like this one : if anyof (header :matches "Authentication-Results" "dmarc=fail") { fileinto "Spams"; }
[13:38:25] <Khepra> don't do that. use spamassassin (or some other content filter) to mark email as spam or not. then write single sieve rule that will look that up, instead of micromanaging headers.
[13:39:11] <Khepra> for example.      if header :contains "X-Spam-Flag" "YES" { fileinto :create "Junk"; } else { keep; }
[13:40:51] <Khepra> spamassassin already knows how to detect dmarc failures, and even if it didn't, it's dead easy to write a rule matched on a header and add score according to that.

[15:55:56] <jelly> furrymcgee, I would not assume ##email catered exclusively to FOSS solutions from its topic.  libera has lots of tech channels that include and embrace proprietary software and services.  I mean there's a whole #windows* namespace.
[15:59:23] <Khepra> no! really?     :)
[16:00:19] <pj> that's absolutely correct.  We're here to help anyone and don't limit our help to FOSS.  That said, you are probably more likely to get help for FOSS solutions just because that's what most people in here will know, but you're welcome to ask and maybe someone can help.
[16:00:53] <pj> The only help that I limit is we don't cater to spammers or scammers, etc.
[16:01:05] <Khepra> sure, but I was specifically looking for a SaaS. the client does not want the cost and problems with maintaining their own mailing software and server and ip reputation etc...
[16:01:29] <Khepra> enormous difference between $10/mo and $1000/mo 
[16:02:05] <Khepra> now, the SaaS itself may or may not be based on purely libre software.
[16:02:08] <pj> Khepra: absolutely.  I can't help you, but I'm fine with someone else in here helping you.  furrymcgee was wrong in trying to limit you.
[16:02:29] <Khepra> I know, hence the .... sass.... from _me_ =)
[16:06:06] <Khepra> I'm "triggerd" by "libre gestapo"
[16:08:15] <colo> well and I _am_ the "libre gestapo", but I do not operate in secret :p
[16:09:17] * Khepra is triggered
[16:10:32] <pj> I do prefer FOSS software, but I don't hold others to that standard, and even I have to compromise when it comes to work and clients.  Putting food on the table for my family is the number 1 priority.
[16:12:26] <Khepra> that said, FOSS and SaaS are orthogonal concepts.
[16:13:16] <Khepra> the company I work for, we provide several SaaS products. they're ALL based on FOSS. not a iota of proprietary code. there used to be some nod32 experimental AV on the mailserver side, but that's long gone, replaced by a ToS that says "Thou shalt run an AV on your client computer!"
[16:13:29] <Khepra> (ie the legal department said "nope" to any offering of AV on _our_ side)
[16:14:11] <Khepra> and inb4 some libre gestapo is triggered by THAT, let it be known that both me and the company I work for have always supported and given back to FOSS with code time and money. lots of money.
[16:14:41] <colo> <Khepra> (ie the legal department said "nope" to any offering of AV on _our_ side) - a rare instance of the legal and reason depts. to agree on something ;)
[16:15:15] <Khepra> :)  they saw liability when understood that AV are less than 90% efficient
[16:44:20] <koollman> wouldn't it make sense to run a minimal AV on the server side anyway ? (not a service 'provided' explicitely)
[16:46:16] <Khepra> in my experience, clamav is pretty much useless. it had very little, if any hits, in our testing. compared to nod32 that found a lot. and that didn't pay off, to use nod32 (or kaspersky or any of the big commercial suites) if the clients ain't paying.
[16:47:00] <Khepra> however, I found that spamassassin dealt with those efficiently, by proxy. not by detecting virus/malware per se of course, but by marking the mail as junk for all the reasons such mail IS junk in principle and can be treated as such.
[16:47:43] <Khepra> vast majority of such mails were regular phishing crap "oh, hai, this is your bank, please find attached this totally-not .exe but happpy little .jpeg.png.hehehe.pdf.exe"
[16:47:57] *** Quits: Bardon_ (~Bardon@user/Bardon) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[16:48:12] <Khepra> and those, attachments with .exe, .com and dot stuff that ain't pdf and jpeg and normal ones, are easy to mark and .Junk, at least in my experience.
[16:49:22] <Khepra> wihch doesn't cover .doc macors and .pdf intrinsic exploits. but the phishing verbiage, RBL membership and other clues almost always marked such as junk.
[16:49:29] <Khepra> *macros
[16:50:54] <koollman> interesting. I've run mail servers a long time ago, and there was still some 'actual malware' in attached stuff from time to time. (mostly evil pdf/doc/ppt at the time, not quite exe and com anymore :) )
[16:50:57] <Khepra> URLBLs with payloads were another successful hits for SpamAssassin. 
[16:51:38] <Khepra> koollman: yeah, there's that, but clamav can't find shit. maybe months after the fact when signatures got into the database, but the malware campaign is long gone by the time this happens
[16:52:56] <Khepra> so this was between "SA is very efficient; and the clients should run an AV anyway" vs "clamav can't find anything so what's the point"   vs   "let's pay four figure yearly license to nod or kaspersky, but we can't charge clients for this because liabilities"
[16:55:31] <koollman> seems reasonable, yes
[17:00:01] <Khepra> the "clients should run an AV" seems like best bet as of... windows 8 or 10, when "Windows Defender" became default, whenever that happened precisely. and from what I hear from windows maintanance folks, very efficient. so majority of people either use default, or install an AV of choice, or disable them altogether because potato gaming.

[21:34:51] <lunaphyte> where are the instructions provided by debian for doing this?
[21:35:21] <tohoyn> AFAIK it is usually done with the "mail" command
[21:35:34] <tohoyn> at least in the code snippets I have encountered
[21:35:35] <lunaphyte> debian provides instructions, right?
[21:35:41] <bremner> for sending mail?
[21:35:50] <tohoyn> I'll google
[21:36:28] <thumbs> tohoyn: any MUA can sign 
[21:36:28] <Khepra> if you need to send an email you'll need to do it from a network that doesn't block port 25 outbound. meanwhile this sounds like a lot of work for no particular reason. do you not have a public email address somewhere?
[21:36:38] <lunaphyte> "encrypted and signed text file" is too vague.  if debian needs/wants this, surely they provide detail on what that actually means
[21:37:09] <Khepra> this is two problems, actually. 1) signage, 2) sending the payload in an email
[21:37:13] <thumbs> for instance, using Thunderbird with GPG will allow you to send an email, sign it, and encrypt it
[21:37:14] <bremner> https://db.debian.org/doc-mail.html
[21:37:26] <bremner> but that assumes "mail" works
[21:37:55] <lunaphyte> tohoyn will have to tell us if that is what they are referring to
[21:38:07] <tohoyn> ok. wait...
[21:38:15] <lunaphyte> perhaps we should back up even further, though - why do you need to send an encrypted and signed text file to changes@db.debian.org
[21:38:40] <tohoyn> see https://db.debian.org/doc-mail.html
[21:38:59] <tohoyn> the mail is needed in order to have ssh access to some porter machines
[21:39:49] <tohoyn> this command: cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub | gpg --clearsign | mail changes@db.debian.org
[21:40:06] <bremner> tohoyn: this is really more a debian discussion, but are you already in debian LDAP (as a DM or a DD)?
[21:40:18] <bremner> otherwise none of this will work.
[21:40:20] <tohoyn> bremner: I'm a DM
[21:40:22] <lunaphyte> so they just want a pgp encrypted/signed message
[21:40:23] <bremner> ok
[21:40:43] <lunaphyte> tohoyn: you have an email address, right?  and you currently use it?
[21:41:01] <tohoyn> tommi.hoynalanmaa@gmail.com and tommi.hoynalanmaa@iki.fi
[21:41:12] <lunaphyte> what mua do you use?
[21:41:18] <tohoyn> Thunderbird
[21:41:35] <Khepra> this practically solved itself then :)
[21:41:38] <thumbs> it's very easy to set up pgp with thunderbird, thankfully
[21:41:47] <lunaphyte> select a pgp add on for thunderbird, install/configure it, and send your message
[21:42:00] <tohoyn> ok.

[21:45:54] <tohoyn> Now the problem is that the contents of the message is a SSH key
[21:46:10] <lunaphyte> why is that a problem?
[21:46:16] <tohoyn> and it seems to be a single long line
[21:46:34] <lunaphyte> sounds correct
[21:46:41] <tohoyn> I toggled "HTML" off for writing in Thunderbird
[21:46:47] <lunaphyte> good idea
[21:47:26] <tohoyn> TB gives an error message when I view the message in "Sent mail"
[21:48:37] <lunaphyte> what is the question?
[21:48:46] <tohoyn> or it was maybe some other message.
[21:49:02] <tohoyn> I tried to send the message in TB earlier, too
[21:49:18] <thumbs> so what is the question?
[21:49:46] <tohoyn> no questions now, I'll have to wait until db.debian.org handles the mail
