[03:44:23] <johnkeats6> hi sorry for the newbie question but I've been searching fruitlessly online and can't figure it out. in asp.net how do i get the IdentityUser instance of the current user?
[03:47:13] <bpmedley> johnkeats6 : HttpContext.Current.User ?
[03:48:58] <bpmedley> Oops, that may just be HttpContext.User.Identity
[03:49:01] <johnkeats6> my HttpContext doesn't have a Current. it does have a User, but it doesn't return an instance of IdentityUser, it returns some long complicated thing that's different and i cannot compare its identity to an instance of IdentityUser
[03:49:34] <bpmedley> Do you have .User.Identity ?
[03:49:49] <johnkeats6> yes but it's not a string
[03:50:05] <johnkeats6> so it doesn't let me compare to user.Id where user is an instance of IdentityUser
[03:50:05] <Suchiman> johnkeats6: using something like UserManager.FindByEmailAsync(User.Identity.Name)
[03:50:08] <bpmedley> Why are you expecting a string?
[03:50:21] <johnkeats6> bpmedley, because it's a string in IdentityUser
[03:50:29] <johnkeats6> i mean, 'Id' is.
[03:50:31] <bpmedley> Are you looking for the User.Id ?
[03:50:56] <johnkeats6> there's no Id in HttpContext.User
[03:50:59] <bpmedley> Does Suchiman's UserManager code help with that?

[03:51:57] <johnkeats6> my UserManager doesn't have FindByEmailAsync :C
[03:52:07] <bpmedley> johnkeats6 : The reason is because the Id is rarely stored in the session / cookie / identity user.
[03:52:33] <johnkeats6> that's confusing
[03:52:41] <johnkeats6> isn't the id the one thing you really want to know about a user?
[03:53:28] <bpmedley> johnkeats6 : Are  you getting UserManager with something like this "private UserManager<AccountEntity> UserManager"

[04:54:31] <Suchiman> johnkeats6: is this ASp.NET Core or ASP.NET Framework?
[04:55:31] <johnkeats6> core
[04:55:38] <johnkeats6> (and nope Options didn't work)
[04:56:35] <Suchiman> johnkeats6: then there should be User.Claims
[04:57:25] <johnkeats6> ok, it exists. sorry for being dumb but how do i get the id from it?
[04:58:10] <Nasp> I've never quite understood why it always need casting
[04:59:26] <Suchiman> johnkeats6: it's an IEnumerable of Claim, check for the claim with the right Type and get it's Value
[05:01:38] <johnkeats6> so User.Claims.FirstOrDefault(claim => claim.Type = "Id").Value?
[05:01:44] <johnkeats6> ops, ==
[05:02:08] <Suchiman> johnkeats6: no, the Type is some long value you have to figure out
[05:02:17] <johnkeats6> :/
[05:04:09] <johnkeats6> at this point i can get the email to work so i think i'll just live with that for now

[07:19:06] <backthen> I want the derived class to somehow to write m_A = "bar" outside of a method
[07:19:31] <Andrio> Set it in the derived type's constructors.
[07:19:52] <Andrio> Or if the base class is yours, you can make it a parameter in the base class constructor.
[07:21:00] <backthen> I was hoping I can do it outside of method/constructor. Guess it's not allowed
[07:28:25] <Andrio> Spoiler alert: instance field initialisers are implicitly run in constructors anyway.

NFT's are nothing more or less than like "certificates of authenticity" and are worth exactly as much or as little as you think the "certifying authorities" guarantee that "You own this" is worth.
[18:14:51] <MizMahem> I recall that like, way back in the day they used to sell like "commemorative plates" on the TV, complete with their own "certificate of authenticity" so the idea is nothing new.

[21:26:29] <Roughy> they obviously still want you to use their branded ink and plaster the thing with warnings not to user any other ink, but our canon inktank takes generic stuff just fine
[21:26:58] <MatthiasVance> Yeah why wouldn't it, as long as the substance is pretty much alike
[21:27:14] <MatthiasVance> I can think of viscosity being a thing, like with oil
[21:27:17] <Roughy> maybe some use ink with a different viscosity
