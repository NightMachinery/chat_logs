[00:35:38] <sybariten> I got helped to this construction  sort_numbers = sorted(theDict.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)[:limitOfNumbers]     could someone help me break down whats going on more precisely? (Save for the last slice, i got that)  For instance, what does the lambda construction do?
[00:36:24] <grym> sybariten: the lambda is exactly the same as `def get_the_second_one(something):return something[1]`
[00:36:25] <deniska> sybariten: lambda does more or less the same thing as `def` statement, it creates a function
[00:36:47] <deniska> sybariten: except `def` assigns it to a name, and lambda is just… there to be used, as an expression

[00:37:37] <sybariten> hm
[00:38:12] <deniska> sybariten: and when you pass a key function to sorted, instead of comparing items directly, it applies the function to each item, and sorts using the result of this function

[00:39:09] <sybariten> yeah i've seen the key thing before. So it's a way to make the sorting functino do a little bit of everything
[00:41:16] <sybariten> OK i think i have to look at some other examples of lambda then. In this case, i would like to make a new version of this sorting where i'm not picking out a value directly (x, i guess) but instead i'm dividing it by something each time. Could that division happen like this, perhaps?   sort_numbers = sorted(theDict.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1]/constant), reverse=True)[:limitOfNumbers]
[00:41:49] <sybariten> well constant will actually be a function call...  so i hope it can be looped somehow
[00:43:14] <az> I've a function in Telegram bot that I want to get a user input from and add it to a dictionary that is used elsewhere, I don't want to modify the the telegram bot function. is there anyway to get the data out from the function into a dictionary that is shared between all function? should I just use json file or a database for that?
[00:43:19] <deniska> sybariten: well, it doesn't really make sense to divide by the constant, it won't change the resulting order :)

[02:51:16] <KirkMcDonald> `with` is a context manager. It does setup when you enter the block and cleanup when you exit the block, as defined by the object being given in that initial expression.
[02:51:36] <jaggz> that'd be cleaner.  where does the return from sd.InputStream() go though?
[02:51:57] <KirkMcDonald> The "return from"? I'm not sure what you're asking.
[02:51:58] <jaggz> does the block become a member of its class? (hence the self. references people use?)
[02:52:12] <KirkMcDonald> `with` is unrelated to `self`.
[02:52:19] <jaggz> like, if you have:  with open(file) as foo:   foo.can_use_stuff_here
[02:52:23] <jaggz> i gave it a name
[02:52:43] <jaggz> but if I do with sd.InputStream():  how_access_stream?
[02:53:20] <KirkMcDonald> That would depend on the specific code or library. I don't know anything about this library.
[02:53:26] <jaggz> (I do see python in my pulseaudio recording streams.. it looks active, but my callback's never called)

[02:54:47] <KirkMcDonald> When you do `with ... as`, the object being used as the context manager can give you an object that you can assign like that. Sometimes, as with your example using open(), that object is just the context manager (the file object) itself.

[05:12:08] <Samian> I've seen code before that creates a large list / array of something, and then converters each item in that large list to create a new list in the converted format.   But instead you could create the converted format from the get go by  doing it per element in the first creation loop.  For example, reading in a list of numbers as strings, and then later converting that large list to a list of type int32. instead of having a
[05:12:08] <Samian>  create-list-of-numbers-in-string-format and later a convert-to-list-of-type-int32,  there could be one for loop that does the conversion per iteration in the loop. Is there a name for this?

[05:12:59] <Samian> the example I gave is a terrible one.
[05:14:29] <sveinse> Anyways, doing this with brute force O(N^2) is trivial enough.
[05:14:30] <Repiphany> Do you start knowing the size of your iterable, i.e. number of keys and dicts

[05:21:49] <Repiphany> sybariten: If you're trying to sort d1 by population density stored in another dict, the sort key is just a function that takes the item from d1 and returns the corresponding population density somehow
[05:22:19] <Repiphany> What are the keys of d1 and how do you get the population density from d2 using those keys
[05:22:56] <sybariten> Repiphany: well almost, it's a per-capita thing. the 5.026 that you see in the first dict there? Its a value for Albania (because albania has id 1) and it should be divided byone of the population values

[07:25:28] <jochum> Wafficus: I'm not sure, if you have lots of files glob.twice will be slower as you run twice through everything
[07:26:37] <jochum> Wafficus: and if you concern about speed you should look at the answer of cluelessperson

[07:29:04] <Wafficus> gotcha, we'll see
[07:29:20] <Wafficus> I think for now, I just want to at least get the images to appear, for .jpg first, and then worry about a double glob later

[07:30:32] <cluelessperson> Wafficus, so  right off,   I personally find glob and walk kinda annoying.   They're basic things that aren't made for what you're doing as much,  so instead of fiddling with working with them, I'd just use the simpler thing and make that obivous
[07:31:31] <cluelessperson> for thing in os.scandir(p):    if thing.is_file() and thing.endswidth(".jpg"):  print(thing)

[07:32:22] <cluelessperson> glob is useful in some cases, but you don't want to be trying to fit your "programming logic" into the globbing/os function.    Just use the programming language for that.
[07:33:08] *** Joins: ldm (~ldm@hacksoc/member)
[07:33:27] <cluelessperson> Wafficus, I'm happy to guide you through these sorts of things. :)
[07:34:34] *** Betal_ is now known as Betal
[07:36:21] <Wafficus> that's the thing
[07:36:37] <Wafficus> its kind of like a necessity project since I don't really want any Wordpress type bloat, just wanted a basic image dump site
[07:37:04] <Wafficus> but yeah, I don't often code as much anymore, so I'll make some segmented headway, and then am like "eh, time to piece this together like legos with Stackoverflow posts"
[07:37:08] <cluelessperson> Sure, so far my suggestions have been pure simple python
[07:37:33] <Wafficus> anyway, I know what I"m stuck on, but I'll have to somehow iron it out or something, we'll see
[07:38:19] <Wafficus> well, string replacement worked so that's good
[07:38:26] <Wafficus> now to just glob for pngs somehow and I'm set

[12:28:48] <carpediembaby> I've seen that there is the possibility to use pip to download packages offline (but its risky as one needs to be sure about the OS and platform). There is also conda-package and docker. Was wondering if someone who has already done this and has some ideas to share.

[12:31:34] <carpediembaby> jochum: How would that work? Ideally, I would also want to package python, since a project might need different version of python than another. How would I go about collecting all the wheels and then putting them in place on the server? Are wheels platform/OS independent?

[19:23:19] <kosh> threads are complicated, if you are using them for async stuff they work fine in python, if you are using them for performance they won't work pretty much at all
[19:24:04] <bjs> rendar: one way to think about it is that if you say have 4 cores, one core is dedicated to running Python.  Any Python code always runs on that core,  and non-Python code (e.g. numpy) can run on the others.  Python is constantly going to be switching between each of the Python threads on that core (possibly in the middle of an opcode).
[19:24:31] <rendar> yes
[19:24:53] <bjs> So if it switches, the asyncio Python code can't run for a bit until Python switches back to asyncio a few microseconds later.  But most asyncio tasks spend most of their time just waiting anyway

[19:28:40] <bjs> I think a lot of the `str` methods do release the GIL though
[19:28:45] <rendar> Python behaves badly for text-based computation? why?
[19:29:16] <bjs> rendar: ah you just spend so much time building and touching and deleting Python objects everywhere
[19:29:33] <bjs> rendar: hmm, I would guess reading a file would release the GIL. I'd have to check

[20:43:12] <bjs> mago: readlines isn't "putting" the newline characters there, they are characters (that you probably cannot see just by looking at it with a text editor or whatever) that are actually in the file
[20:43:21] <mago> Ok, so the \n is behind the 9999 but I cant see it in gedit?
[20:43:34] <bjs> mago: I don't know, it might be it might not. gedit is hiding it from you
[20:43:44] <mago> Mmm ok, i think i understand now.
[20:43:55] <bjs> mago: if the last line doesn't end in a newline character, then the readlines() won't have it in that string, so when you shuffle and stick them back together it might be that there are two words that are from two lines but without a newline character between
[20:43:58] <bjs> so they'll just stuck together

[22:26:44] <dontyouloveshort> hi
[22:26:50] <bjs> if they're not, you can do some optimization if it's worth it
[22:27:19] <dontyouloveshort> when i run: print(repr(str(item)))   i get:  "b'19:54:48.124423 IP 192.168.0.197.36889 > 192.168.0.1.8000: UDP, length 5\\n'"      what is with the double quoting?
[22:27:31] *** Quits: oscarcp (~CastleDwe@217.194.54.110) (Quit: oscarcp)
[22:27:40] <bjs> dontyouloveshort: because repr gives you the representation which includes quotes
[22:28:02] <bjs> dontyouloveshort: but then you also call str() which turns the item into a string first
[22:28:07] <Yhg1s> dontyouloveshort: item is bytes, so str(item) is actually repr(item). And then you call repr() on that string.
[22:28:32] <bjs> dontyouloveshort: if item is bytes, you'll get an extra layer of quotes.  Just use print(repr(item))  there's never a need to call str(item) too
[22:28:43] <dontyouloveshort> ah ok
[22:29:28] <bjs> dontyouloveshort: if print(repr(item)) still has the double quotes, then there is something else going on :)
[22:29:30] <dontyouloveshort> i was just wondering why:  m = re.match('(?P<time>\d\d:\d\d:\d\d\.\d{6}).*', str(item))       19:00:20.316913 IP 192.168.0.197.55699 > 192.168.0.1.8000: UDP, length 5    does not match, theres probably a high level abstraction for what im doing
[22:29:59] <bjs> dontyouloveshort: what is item?  str(some_bytes) is not how you turn bytes into a str

[23:47:19] <henistein> I have a question for a long time: When using multidimensional arrays we use arr[x][y] , if we try arr[x, y] it raises an error because it is a tuple. So how can a library like numpy modify the brackets behaviour?
[23:48:25] <sveinse> henistein: because numpy accepts the tuple index arr[(x, y)] as argument to their functions
[23:48:26] <jinsun> henistein: you can make a class and write your own __getattr__ inside that

[23:49:51] <jinsun> ah no __getitem__
[23:50:22] <jinsun> __getatttr__ is for the dot notation
[23:50:27] <sveinse> you can defin.... what he said ^

[23:54:57] <jokoon> how can I get the syntaxerror message stuff returned by eval() ?
[23:55:14] <harwiltz> Hello all. I'm working with a python library that has a very "functional" style. Consequently I find myself writing lots of lambda functions that take the form of something like "lambda x: x.operation_1().operation_2().operation_3()...". How would you go about breaking this up into multiple lines?
[23:55:50] <harwiltz> In java for instance, you can put line breaks before each period, but this doesn't seem to work in python
[23:56:10] <jmcantrell> Make it a regular function
[23:56:35] <harwiltz> jmcantrell: yeah I guess that'll work, but then I would have to define a bunch of intermediate variables
[23:56:45] <jinsun> harwiltz: https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html#call-chains
[23:56:53] <harwiltz> jinsun: thanks!
[23:57:17] <jinsun> harwiltz: just write it all in one line, then do `black your_file.py`
[23:57:19] <bjs> jokoon: it doesn't return it, it raises an exception.  In Python exceptions can be caught with a try/except statement.

[23:57:38] <jokoon> bjs, I know, but how can I get the error message?
[23:58:00] <bjs> jokoon: it's part of the exception object, if you catch it you can get the message: `except SyntaxError as e: print(str(e))`

[23:58:58] <bjs> harwiltz: black is just a tool that re-formats your .py files for you
[23:59:03] <jinsun> harwiltz: yes, it just reformats python code to match its own style
[23:59:18] <bjs> people like it and even if you don't use it yourself it can be instructive to see how it would format your code
[23:59:18] <harwiltz> Oh so you actually can split at the periods in python?
