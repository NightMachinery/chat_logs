[00:30:40] <sney> you are probably just missing /sbin from your $PATH, but you can also e.g. 'systemctl reboot' or 'systemctl poweroff'
[00:30:58] <sney> !buster su
[00:30:59] <dpkg> Starting with buster, su no longer overrides PATH by default, requiring that you use "su -" or "su -l" for login shells (which is not really a new thing at all...). See https://wiki.debian.org/NewInBuster#Changes for details.

I can ssh into the box and the host can ping the guest ip address.. but the guest cannot get outside internet access...   I think I messed something up with the network interfaces, I do don't know what.. I don't get any failure messages when I boot...

[13:29:27] <Khepra> PaulJ1: I don't know, that's the thing, if there was firmware missing, there'd be a complaint by the kernel. So, if you installed all those packages under the "Configuration" section of the wiki, not sure what you can do except maybe google for the model, there could be a kernel cmdline hack or something to enable it
[13:29:36] <PaulJ1> journalctl returns also "kernel: snd_hda_codec_hdmi hdaudioC0D2: No i915 binding for Intel HDMI/DP codec"

[13:31:19] <Khepra> goblin: a) backport from sid,   b) wait for someone to bullseye-backport it,    c) don't use 5.14.    I'm assuming 460 doesn't support 5.14 kernel?
[13:32:09] <goblin> Khepra, I'm not sure if 460 doesn't support 5.14; I'm just guessing that's what's causing the compilation error
[13:32:11] <Khepra> (  d) use the nvidia's .run installer. I did not say this, I was never here. Caveat emptor. You break it you keep all the pieces. The complaints department is closed for the year. Pandemic. )
[13:32:32] <System_Error> Haohmaru> IIRC xorg should have some, and there're some more on the web any day

[13:35:54] <Khepra> !ssb
[13:35:54] <dpkg> First, check for a backport on <debian-backports>.  If unavailable: 1) Add a deb-src line for sid (not a deb line!); ask me about <deb-src sid> 2) enable debian-backports (see <bdo>) 3) apt update; apt install build-essential; apt build-dep packagename 4) apt -b source packagename 5) dpkg -i packagename-ver.deb  To change compilation options, see <package recompile>; for versions newer than sid see <uupdate>.

[13:37:44] <Khepra> otherwise, it's not unusual for backported packages to be... misaligned with each other, especially when it comes to out of tree kernel modules. notable examples that I have to deal with:  ZFS

[14:01:56] <jelly> TandyUK: mount the root filesystem somewhere, chroot into it, "passwd root" to set a (new) root password
[14:01:57] <PerfDave> TandyUK: Mount the partition(s) of the installed system somewher on your rescue CD's filesystem (probably under /mnt/), then chroot into it, and use passwd
[14:02:16] <Khepra> tjcarter: it's discouraging, but if the worst happens, I'll sooner drop linux than zfs. if that worst happens, that means linux is done, over. baked. dead. it's an ex kernel.
[14:02:39] <Khepra> ie. politics have won, there's no longer open and libre anywhere in linux
[14:03:10] <tjcarter> Khepra: I suspect politics have already won. 😕
[14:03:37] <tjcarter> But that's a bigger problem than licenses of zfs and linux
[14:03:42] <Khepra> zfs is still installable, albeit out of tree. GKH's crusade can still be averted with a shrug and "ho-kay, we'll just write our own APIs"

[14:04:23] <jelly> I've been looking a bcachefs for 2-3 years now :-|

[14:09:04] <PerfDave> I'll just see what happens in future. For now Moore's Law is keeping disk space growing faster than I consume it.
[14:09:21] <TandyUK> its because the R8125 (i think) driver isnt included in the kernel, so it fails to start networking and goes into emergency mode
[14:09:24] <Khepra> PerfDave: yeah but filesystems are notoriously difficult computational problems. And they're mostly about experience, rather than theoretical and academic influence.

[18:28:23] <somiaj> maledictium: sure, the problem is usrmerge makes /bin (and /sbin) links. Most stuff is installed in /usr/bin (only some core stuff is installed in /bin), but if you just leave off the forward slash as I suggested, you'll match the binary no matter which directory it was offically instaleld to
[18:29:00] <somiaj> xx: their issue is not that they have a broken install, it is that dpkg -S doesn't play nicely with usrmerge unless you correctly guess the actual install path or do what I suggested so you can match both places easy enough
[18:29:33] <xx> somiaj: I see. Well it's likely that next debian release will install things to correct places and hence the database will have the correct entries unlike now
[18:29:49] <maledictium> somiaj: ah ok. I missed the initial forward slash! :)
[18:29:58] <somiaj> xx: Might be something with the xfce window manager, if a minimize/maximize fixes the issue, the window isn't correctly refreshing after the change leaving some visual artifacts until the window is redrawn. I don't know how to force this in xfce.
[18:30:21] <somiaj> xx: yea, or maybe dpkg -S will be made smart enough to understand usrmerge and with both /bin and /usr/bin look in both places.

[18:53:50] <somiaj> so check if you have either avahi-autoipd or connman installed
[18:54:40] <somiaj> usually I susepct it is avahi-autoipd doing this, but dhcpd can do it and so can connman

[21:57:28] <jelly> rawtaz: right.  So libnvpair3linux isn't pinned, and apt install won't even consider installing the backports version automatically
[21:58:01] <jelly> rawtaz: just for fun, does "apt-get install zfs-dkms zfsutils-linux" behave differently?
[21:58:25] <jelly> (different from apt install ... wrt those deps)
[21:58:59] <sney> rawtaz: also, the instructions from openzfs say to use *buster* backports because they require minimum zfs 2.0.0. it is not necessary to use bullseye-backports as well, the zfs packages in bullseye itself are just fine.

[22:00:55] <jelly> ok, no idea whether 5.14 works with 2.03 here
[22:00:57] <xx> for zfs, might as well use ubuntu, they have it as part of the kernel instead of a module, right?
[22:01:15] <xx> because somehow canonical lawyers said it's ok and that everyone else is wrong

[22:02:09] <rawtaz> thanks. let me try to understand what the heck you peeps are saying :-)
[22:02:10] <xx> but to be more on-topic, zfs works fine here on debian11 using versions from stable and not backports

[22:02:21] <jelly> worst thing that can happen is you LOSE ALL YOUR DATA
[22:02:22] <sney> rawtaz: I'm using zfs in a few places and the last time I had any build issues was in the 5.9/5.10 transition. 2.0.3 is worth a shot anyway, and you should always ask *why* something is rather than blindly using backports with a different debian version
[22:02:30] <xx> yeah, have backups for sure
[22:03:04] <xx> I've lost data on btrfs and zfs both
[22:03:04] <jelly> rawtaz: is there a different reason to use 5.14 kernel btw?
[22:03:17] <rawtaz> xx: i have had zfs running fine on this machine which was buser. then updated it to bullseye, and zfs still worked fine (of course packages updated, with the current config i have). then i updated bullseye once, things still worked. that was like a week or two ago. this time however it failed. so it's worked fine until recently, with no changes to apt configs or such.
[22:03:26] <sney> I just checked and rawtaz's initial paste shows a 5.10 kernel, too
[22:03:37] <rawtaz> jelly: i have no idea. i'd like to use whatever bullseye recommends
[22:03:49] <sney> this is really just transposing instructions without thinking
[22:03:55] <jelly> rawtaz: then maybe don't use backports at all, not for kernel, not for zfs-*
[22:04:22] <jelly> remove the backports kernel, see if stuff from bullseye works
[22:04:27] * xx grumbles because can't use backported tmux because it would remove tmuxinator
[22:04:29] <sney> zfs certainly works well with bullseye sources only
[22:05:49] <rawtaz> yeah, i'd be fine with stable probably.
[22:06:08] <jelly> we have at least two eople who actually use zfs saying stuff from stable works.
[22:06:10] <rawtaz> sney: well specifically regarding the linux kernel, im not keeping track of the developments there at all
[22:06:48] <sney> then remove backports from your sources, and delete your pinning, and try installing zfs-dkms with just the linux-headers from stable
[22:06:58] <jelly> me, I am zfs agnostic, just know a bit about basic apt troubleshooting
[22:06:58] <sney> and then create your pools and datasets because it will Just Work
[22:07:46] <jelly> no need to remove backports from sources.  Just get rid of pinning and uninstall that backports kernel.
[22:07:53] <rawtaz> yeah. so; 1) remove/disable the backports source and the pinning file; should i then remove the zfs related packages that were installed, do a full-upgrade or similar, and then re-run the install commands for the zfs stuff?
[22:08:12] <sney> sure, start fresh
[22:08:18] <rawtaz> sney: i already have a pool. i guess i'll see if it's too new for the older zfs now then :D
[22:08:24] <jelly> bullseye-backports can safely be kepy enabled and nothing will get installed from there automatically
[22:08:45] <rawtaz> jelly: right because it will only be used if you apply some pinning such that packages are actively selected from it, correct?
[22:08:55] <xx> jelly: unless a package doesn't exist in -stable
[22:09:15] <sney> sure, keep bpo if you feel like keeping bpo, the point is you don't need it for this project. I would disable it for now, and only enable it explicitly in the future for a specific reason
[22:09:22] <xx> which was definitely the case with zfs before in buster
[22:09:30] <sney> but you can just flip a coin, it's safe
[22:09:43] <jelly> xx: yes, if you ask apt to install a package that only exists in backports, it will install that.  Still not automatic.
[22:10:08] <xx> I guess we have different understanding of 'automatic'
[22:10:21] <rawtaz> jelly: will it ask you with a y/n prompt if you want to pull it in from the backports instead?
[22:10:48] <jelly> rawtaz: I don't think it will if that's the only possible solution
[22:11:17] <rawtaz> ok. then it's pretty automatic it sounds like :D

[22:13:18] <rawtaz> sney: FWIW, i think the reason ive been using zfs from backports is taht the instructions from openzfs pretty much suggests that you do use it. and since i dont have time, resources or knowledge to understand the source code to the extent that i can determine if the backport versions of zfs are unstable or stable, i made the choice to trust that the official instructions were for a "stable enough" version of zfs, hence i used the backports. as per https://openz

[22:34:15] <sney> !why recommends
[22:34:15] <dpkg> From Debian 5.0 "Lenny" onwards, apt-get and aptitude both install "Recommended" packages by default. From <policy> section 7.2, Recommends, "declares a strong, but not absolute, dependency. The Recommends field should list packages that would be found together with this one in all but unusual installations." You're not that unusual, trust us. By not installing "recommended" packages you will be missing functionality.

[22:39:26] <rawtaz> yeah theres a false setting for recomments in /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/00InstallRecommends . i havent added that file. possibly my hosting provider did in their debian image.
[22:39:51] <f8e4> jelly ty
[22:40:02] <rawtaz> that has to be the case, unless it's a default file in debian itself. which i guess it isnt
