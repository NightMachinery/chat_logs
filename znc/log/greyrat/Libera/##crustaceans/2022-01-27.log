[00:16:56] <manicennui> Uh oh.
[00:17:02] <manicennui> I think my friend has been sucked into a DAO cult.
[00:17:22] <mouseghost> uh oh
[00:17:35] <ngoldbaum> uploaded into the blockchain
[00:17:36] <manicennui> Everything he describes sounds very cult-like, but he claims that they all talk about it that way as a bit of a joke.
[00:17:52] <manicennui> He even refers to the leaders as Masters.
[00:17:55] <manicennui> With a capital M.
[00:18:07] <manicennui> Lots of red flags.
[00:18:30] <companion_cube> wait, there are leaders?
[00:18:34] <epilys> is it scrum?
[00:18:36] <manicennui> heh
[00:18:40] <manicennui> companion_cube: Good point.
[00:18:40] <companion_cube> I lol'd, epilys
[00:18:45] <manicennui> I didn't even question that.
[00:19:33] <manicennui> I just assumed that it was either a cult or soon would be, and didn't question why a DAO would have leaders.
[00:19:40] <manicennui> They all seem to though.
[00:19:58] <manicennui> I know that Spice DAO has paid people at the top.
[00:20:08] <Church> God this podcast is great, nothing like jokes about Zuckerberg and the metaverse
[00:20:17] <drakonis> which one?
[00:20:25] <drakonis> also have you heard of darknet diaries?
[00:20:46] <manicennui> Temple DAO
[00:20:51] <manicennui> No
[00:21:18] <manicennui> He claims that they are trying to create crypto currency that is more stable and not a pump and dump.
[00:21:23] <manicennui> But the cult factor is super high.
[00:22:08] <Church> drakonis: Dungeons and Daddies
[00:22:15] <Church> Fucking great DnD podcast
[00:22:16] <drakonis> ah yes.
[00:22:19] <Church> S2 just came out
[00:22:25] <Church> And fuck me it's greatttt
[00:22:36] <gwozniak> Church: oh neat, I should check that out
[00:22:41] <Church> They're playing the grandkids in this one, and god is it great.
[00:22:43] <companion_cube> sadly, if there's no pump and dump, there's no use at all
[00:22:49] <Church> gwozniak: You've listened to the first season?
[00:24:07] <gwozniak> Church: no. But it sounds like something I'd enjoy
[00:24:29] <gwozniak> companion_cube: yup
[00:24:44] <Church> Ah so. S1 pitch is: "a D&D real play podcast about four fathers who are sent to the Forgotten Realms in search of their lost sons. It's a journey of fatherhood, dad rock, and psychic damage: what's not to like?"
[00:25:22] <Church> The best part being, they're all writers, directors or sound engineers. So it actually flows well un-like a lot of others
[00:26:23] <gwozniak> My D&D friends watch Critical Role, which is apparently quite good
[00:26:43] <Church> I've heard good things

[06:43:27] <manicennui> "Welcome to r/WorkReform . We believe that each person should not be worked to death by their employers with ridiculous wages that are unable to cover basic life needs."
[06:43:55] <manicennui> antiwork got shut down?
[06:44:17] <manicennui> r/antiwork is a private community
[06:44:20] <manicennui> reddit drama!
[06:45:03] <manicennui> Some seem to be blaming it on the horrible Fox News interview.
[06:45:39] <imode> it's entirely due to the fox news interview.

[06:50:27] <manicennui> It was bad, but more embarrassing for the mod than anything.

[07:02:43] <manicennui> That looks like it.
[07:03:13] <manicennui> The damn thing starts with a strawman.
[07:12:24] <manicennui> The Fox News host is a top notch troll.
[07:12:43] <manicennui> I don't even understand why they agreed to go on there.
[07:14:01] <gwozniak> Seems like a poor choice
[07:14:20] <gwozniak> You have to go to those things prepared
[07:15:20] <gwozniak> Tried Alacritty on macOS again.  It is not a good choice there unless you like remapping keys
[07:16:55] <bontaq> apparently the community voted on whether they should do interviews or not, said no, and they still did it
[07:21:24] <manicennui> As soon as he asks the guy what he does there is no way to recover.
[07:21:30] <manicennui> Nothing against dog walkers, but JFC
[07:22:10] <bontaq> yeah they couldn't have hoped for a better charicature for "anti-work" people
[07:28:23] <manicennui> gwozniak: The problem is Fox News has no interest in hearing their side.
[07:28:37] <manicennui> gwozniak: The best you can hope for is not looking like a fool.
[07:30:39] <gwozniak> Another option is to be antagonistic back
[07:30:49] <gwozniak> Not a great option, but it's there
[07:31:16] <gwozniak> I mean, yeah, I wonder how you think that interview is gonna go
[07:31:32] <gwozniak> Clearly they are not interested in being "fair and balanced"
[07:33:34] <manicennui> I also don't think antiwork is a coherent group with a perfectly aligned vision, which doesn't help.
[07:34:09] <gwozniak> I've only followed it based on what gets on the front page and it has always been chaotic
[07:37:25] <manicennui> I think they only agree broadly.
[07:37:55] <bontaq> yeah it's a mix of anarchists, communists, and a much larger portion of people just treated like dirt at work
[07:38:34] <gwozniak> I mostly see the stuff that is someone being treated like dirt at work
[07:38:47] <gwozniak> And I don't really read the comments
[07:38:58] <bontaq> but I think you can start with "do you want to die at work" and "should you have to go on food stamps" to at least get the general anti-work idea w/o bringing up luxury gay space communism

[17:41:38] <gwozniak> We usually make at least one thing a week that will provide lunches and leftovers for a few days
[17:42:49] <Brekkjern> When I make pizza dough I usually make an extra batch and let it rise in the fridge. And the sauce is usually a larger batch that I put in a jar right after cooking it so that it's ready to use later.

[17:44:09] <jlindgren_> its 8am and now im hungry, thanks everyone

[17:44:32] <Brekkjern> gerikson: lolno :P I usually need to go to the store at least 3 times a week.
[17:44:38] <Brekkjern> jlindgren: You're welcome.
[17:45:37] <jlindgren> pizza is the ultimate leftovers since you can eat it for breakfast/cold/hot/2am etdc
[17:46:12] <jlindgren> specifically always getting the largest size available just for leftovers is my wife's least favorite thing i do.
[17:46:17] <jlindgren> ...but ill eat it eventually lol
[17:47:15] <Brekkjern> I usually don't have leftovers when I make pizza as I make it to portion and have the dough in my fridge
[17:47:20] <Brekkjern> Fresh pizza every time :)
[17:47:27] <Brekkjern> But in general I agree
[17:47:58] <gwozniak> Fresh pizza is, indeed, a wonderful thing

[17:57:50] <gwozniak> This issue at work about the compiler being too slow (which is actually a network/infra issue) is now into its 4th month of trying to be resolved
[17:58:10] <gwozniak> It's kind of comical to watch at this point
[18:10:50] <jlindgren> gwozniak: is it basically them going "theres no way its us" and your team going "nuh-uh" back and forth? for that long???
[18:12:01] <gwozniak> It started out that way, but now it's just them trying to figure out how their build works and why network access is so slow
[18:12:30] <gwozniak> In a way it's us because of this license manager thing that is in our compiler (that I am not a fan of, but hey...)
[18:13:04] <gwozniak> It's the license config that's the problem, and it seems setting an environment variable solves the problem
[18:13:14] <gwozniak> But... they can't seem to set it, basically
[18:14:48] <jlindgren> wow. thats maddening
[18:16:15] <gwozniak> Thankfully I'm just observing at this point
[18:16:35] <gwozniak> I was on a call watching them debug this and I had to bite my tongue a lot
[18:17:40] <gwozniak> There is some sort of job submission system that is kind of baffling, frankly, and they seemed to be making random changes to a Makefile
[18:17:47] <companion_cube> gwozniak: I find that buying dough is already nice enough
[18:18:07] <companion_cube> then you just assemble it with tomato sauce and mozarella and it's quite nice, for minimal effort

[19:33:56] <manicennui> Potatoes are a good source of all kinds of things, including vitamin C and potassium.
[19:34:15] <manicennui> A lot of what we think we know about various fruits and vegetables and nutrition is from marketing.
[19:34:51] <companion_cube> oh wow, TIL
[19:35:00] <companion_cube> well then I guess I'll cook them even more heartily
[19:35:05] <companion_cube> in OIL
[19:36:15] <ngoldbaum> potatoes are great for you
[19:36:26] <ngoldbaum> sure, they’re starchy and have some calories
[19:36:41] <ngoldbaum> but for their size don’t actually have a ton of calories
[19:36:51] <companion_cube> the point of eating is to get calories :D
[19:36:55] <ngoldbaum> ofc if you douse them in butter or oil they do
[19:38:03] <manicennui> And there are tons of different types of potatoes with different good stuff in them.
[19:38:17] <companion_cube> ah well, I cook them in a bit of oil, yes :p
[19:38:22] <manicennui> Pretty easy to find different varieties in major cities now.
[19:38:52] <gwozniak> Potatoes are a staple food at my place
[19:38:57] <manicennui> Not a lot of reason to eat Russets.
[19:45:01] <jlindgren> manicennui: are russets just less nutritious? i know nothing.
[19:45:41] <manicennui> They are fine. They are just a bit boring flavor/texture wise, and colors in vegetables tend to indicate more antioxidants, especially reds and purples.
[19:46:03] <manicennui> They are still high in vitamin C and potassium and a few other things.
[19:46:23] <manicennui> In most cases I'd prefer Yukon golds or new (red) potatoes.
[19:47:18] <manicennui> There are some dishes where you want the potato to fall apart and Russets work better for that.
[19:49:10] <gwozniak> Russets make a good baking potato
[19:49:49] <gwozniak> Our favourite thing here is to cook potatoes twice.  Either boil or bake, then fry them in fat/oil the next day

[19:51:37] <manicennui> Hello, I'm a 21 years old male, long-term unemployed and an Anarchist.
[19:52:12] <manicennui> So basically he is nothing like most of the people who support the sub.
[19:52:18] <Xe> https://christine.website/blog/make-microservices-cluster-2022-01-27 <- MIGROSERBICES
[19:52:30] <imode> manicennui: tends to be the case.
[19:52:49] <imode> "It's called a zero calorie word salad."
[19:52:50] <ngoldbaum> manicennui: the sub predated the popularity explosion and this guy was top mod
[19:52:59] <manicennui> Sure.
[19:53:03] <ngoldbaum> reddit seniority
[19:53:11] <manicennui> But its popularity is also why it is receiving media requests.
[19:53:25] <manicennui> They don't want to talk to the mods about anarchism.
[19:53:38] <imode> 5 minutes of fame is better than a functioning movement.
[19:55:02] <manicennui> He also did 4 interviews that haven't been released yet.
[19:55:08] <manicennui> Will be interesting to see what those are like.
[19:55:15] <companion_cube> Xe: I read some posts on how to run on sqlite recently
[19:55:16] <manicennui> I don't know whether this is the guy who was on Fox.
[19:55:19] <companion_cube> so interesting and refreshing
[19:55:23] <imode> it was not, iirc.
[19:56:01] <imode> tbf I won't be surprised if this is a part of an infiltration op by the people who don't want this sub being taken legitimately.
[19:56:18] <companion_cube> ahaha fuck, the expert in YAML
[19:57:28] <manicennui> imode: As I wrote yesterday, nothing against dog walkers, but that was really not the profession to have to get mainstream people to take them seriously.
[19:58:10] <jlindgren> manicennui: the 4 interviews thing is what irks me the most. the sub voted to not do press, and they did 5+ interviews against the vote?
[20:00:22] <manicennui> Fortunately I think there is a real trend of people taking less shit from employers, and many people are receiving a bit more money, but /r/antiwork in particular reminds me a bit of Occupy Wallstreet.
[20:00:45] <manicennui> Not the submissions that make it to the front page, but clearly the people who are trying to turn it into some kind of movement.
[20:00:54] <manicennui> Have their hearts in the right place, but it is a bit of a mess.
[20:03:32] <manicennui> They could be really powerful if they could organize nationally.
[20:04:49] <imode> organization is difficult and is very much a full-time job.
[20:04:55] <imode> which is why it won't happen.

[20:25:44] <edk> how can you be long-term unemployed as a 21-year-old
[20:25:55] <manicennui> Unemployed since birth.
[20:26:03] <edk> but with that said it seems ridiculous that /r/antiwork is getting so much attention
[20:26:13] <manicennui> edk: Why?
[20:26:19] <ngoldbaum> assigned unemployed at birth
[20:26:31] <manicennui> edk: That the drama is getting so much attention?
[20:26:38] <manicennui> Or the overall problem with employment?
[20:27:01] <manicennui> Which /r/antiwork did a decent job of representing until a day ago.
[20:27:21] <edk> no, the drama was created by attention
[20:27:34] <edk> people who aren't anti-work didn't have a lot of reason to care about this
[20:27:54] <manicennui> What do you think anti-work means?
[20:27:59] <edk> ?
[20:28:07] <manicennui> Many of us are "anti-work".
[20:28:08] <ngoldbaum> there’s two distinct things, actual anarchists who think all jobs are scams
[20:28:12] <manicennui> But might mean different things.
[20:28:32] <ngoldbaum> and union organizing driven by a sudden reversal in the labor market post-covid
[20:28:44] <ngoldbaum> those are disjoint things with kinda overlapping goals sorta
[20:28:50] <imode> agree.
[20:29:08] <manicennui> The only reason most of us know about the sub are the submissions in the latter category making it to the frontpage.
[20:29:14] <manicennui> And anarchism is dumb.
[20:29:35] <imode> I'm a little of column A little of column B.
[20:29:38] <manicennui> It's in the same bucket with libertarianism.
[20:29:47] <manicennui> Requires a divorce from reality.
[20:30:01] <imode> I think the vast amount of jobs are stupid and we should be focused on collective work to better the whole and the individual.
[20:30:09] <manicennui> imode: I agree with that.
[20:30:13] <manicennui> I don't think that is anarchism though.
[20:30:14] <imode> but that ain't anarchism.
[20:30:16] <imode> yeah.
[20:30:16] <edk> i heard about /r/antiwork because it was in the actual news
[20:30:38] <edk> anarchism and collectivism are strongly related
[20:30:54] <manicennui> I wish the mainstream would talk seriously about post-scarcity.
[20:31:01] <imode> scarcity makes money.
[20:31:08] <ngoldbaum> edk: and yet lenin lined up all the anarchists against the wall after they tried to assassinate him
[20:31:14] <manicennui> imode: Yup.
[20:31:19] <imode> you want them to talk about not making money?
[20:31:22] <ngoldbaum> the revolutions podcast is covering that bit atm
[20:31:24] <manicennui> imode: Yes.
[20:31:35] <imode> that wouldn't make them money!!11!!11!!
[20:31:45] <manicennui> I want to turn on Fox News and see a lovely show about gardening and making bread.
[20:31:55] <imode> yeah.. me too.
[20:32:16] <edk> ngoldbaum: lenin was only a collectivist in that he thought the collective should sacrifice itself in favour of lenin
[20:32:16] <manicennui> Maybe Fox News caters a bit more to the bushcraft people.
[20:33:02] <imode> edk: valid. be warned you're treading into scotsman territory.
[20:33:46] <edk> it's silly to define all words the soviets used to describe themselves to include the soviets
[20:34:02] <edk> i'll give you that they were marxists, or communists
