[00:34:05] <jim> if you have no "logical" partitions, and no extended partition to put em in, then you get a choice to make an "extended" partition, which MUST be one of your primary partitions
[00:34:19] <jim> so that must be the case here
[00:34:33] <uwharrie> primary should be fine for this purpose, the type I'm talking about is the type ID: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_type#List_of_partition_IDs
[00:34:50] <Guest45> oh maybe that's what partition number is
[00:34:58] <uwharrie> where 07 indicates exFat
[00:35:07] <koala_man> y'all still on MBR?
[00:35:10] <Guest45> no, that's a lot more than 4. I can only use a number between 0 and 4

[00:41:53] <jim> ok, now I also understand why you picked exfat
[00:42:14] <Dan39> i already know how to interupt the boot to do it, or change the default
[00:42:22] <TJ-> It soon won't be a problem - the full function NTFS driver is about to be merged into the kernel
[00:43:05] <TJ-> Dan39: no, presuming the boot-loader is GRUB
[00:43:07] <jim> other than having a new ntfs driver in the kernel, would that add features to ntfs filesystems?
[00:43:30] <TJ-> jim: yes, the current kernel driver is read-only and doesn't support all NTFS features.
[00:43:42] <uwharrie> Dan39: like https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/systemd-boot#Choosing_next_boot ?

[14:19:45] <cre> ups, wrong channel
[14:19:56] <hexnewbie> slidercrank: The userspace udev which you modify the rules for does NOT create devices. The kernel does. The module should be fixed to take care of that and create the node. Adding a symlink to it won't be of much help.
[14:21:34] <hexnewbie> slidercrank: You can probably whip up a rule to run a shell script after the module is loaded as a workaround, maybe
[14:22:21] <slidercrank> hexnewbie, thanks for the reply. on ##kernel I was told that extra steps are needed (from the driver side) to make udev work

[22:40:18] <Dagmar> Betal: No, but when you *do* go to swap will be more often because now some of your RAM is basically going to be taken up by processes you can't use because they were compressed
[22:40:40] <joo-_> ok thx
[22:40:49] <Dagmar> Compressed or not, using RAM as swap is just as mad as it sounds
[22:40:57] <n4dir>  joo-_: you didn't say how much diskspace is used, if i didn't miss it. If not too much i'd start with backing up
[22:41:04] <onelegend> Dagmar: do you use a tmpfs?
[22:41:20] <Dagmar> onelegend: Sometimes but that doesn't have anytghing do to with it
[22:41:27] <n4dir> joo-_: then try to sort it, as good as possible, if big failure, only that is screwed
[22:41:27] <koollman_> Dagmar: although it does work. It would be useless *if* everything currently in memory was useful and used often
[22:41:44] <joo-_> n4dir: it is very low and i already got backup every 4 hours

[22:45:00] <koollman_> but if something else can be swapped out, more memory usable for cache, for example
[22:45:20] <Dagmar> Very marginal amounts
[22:45:35] <Psi-Jack> I don't want my hard drives in highly humid conditions such as clouds.
[22:45:45] <koollman_> depends on the size. I've made some tests ... results vary pretty widely, but on average I would say zram helps a bit
[22:45:45] <Dagmar> Meanwhile the very fact that nothing was actually evicted from RAM means you'
[22:45:48] <Psi-Jack> Doesn't sound reliable....

[22:53:41] <koollman_> Betal: ah. no, no zswap on those tests
[22:54:20] <koollman_> joo-_: s3 would be terrible for that. And if you consider dropbox fast enough, many solutions may work decently. With dropbox and the like the data is not shared, but synchronized (slowly)
[22:55:59] <joo-_> dropbox is actually an ok option, but i've had some issues that makes me trust the data integrity less, and i need a free sofware solution
[22:56:00] <koollman_> joo-_: so, whatever can do directory synchronisation to and from one or more repository, may be sufficient for you. syncthing, csync2, unison, probably some stuff provided by nextcloud, too
[22:56:15] <Dagmar> If all you're dealing with is multiple datacenters on the _same campus_, like, only yards or a few miles away from each other, the latency is not going to be terrible
[22:56:17] <koollman_> git would work, too :)
[22:56:46] <koollman_> (considering the small dataset)

[23:09:07] <sumthing1980> Ill have 3 terminal programs open and one script sending data to one of the other based on what type of info it is
[23:09:14] <mlu> sumthing1980: know how you can direct output anywhere? I'd direct the output to a temporary file, and then `tail -f` that file in the other window
[23:09:17] <sumthing1980> or just use watch tail?
[23:09:33] <mlu> that's what I'd use: just the tail
[23:09:34] <hexnewbie> I just ‘tty &’ on the ‘destination’ terminal to both get the name, and add a new line so the output starts after the prompt (possibly make it read-only then if the terminal emulator supports it)
[23:09:39] <mlu> keeps things much more recognizeable
[23:10:00] <koala_man> sumthing1980: it's generally easier to have the other terminals run something that displays the output you want, rather than having one program write to them. both are doable do
[23:10:05] <mlu> you're basically using it as a live log, right?

[23:10:41] <mlu> yeah: makes more sense to redirect the output to a file and then follow it
[23:10:48] <mlu> you can also do fancier stuff such as creating a socket, etc.
[23:11:04] <hexnewbie> FIFO is simpler and tailored for this case

[23:11:23] <sumthing1980> works

[23:49:03] <Exa> Hi, I'd like to create a Docker tag on a registry in a CI environment (that points to an existing tag).  I know I can do that with kaniko and a one-line Dockerfile for the source tag, but I'm looking for a much lighter Docker image to do that job, or a lightweight non-root tool that I can include in a scratch image.  Any guess?  Thanks.
