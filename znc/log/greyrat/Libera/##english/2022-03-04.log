[00:06:33] <GuiToris> blkshp, you forgot to mention if that disorder has a name when you cannot recall people's faces
[00:06:50] <blkshp> I don't know of such a disorder.
[00:07:20] <blkshp> Actually, I know of a disorder where people get faces confused, but if you're thinking of what I have, it's the inability to visualise mentally and it's called aphantasia
[00:07:44] <blkshp> Face Blindness is called Prosopagnosia

[00:13:09] <GuiToris> and I'm not talking about blind dates
[00:15:04] <blkshp> Has it actually happened?
[00:15:25] <GuiToris> do you think I'm just entertaining you? :P

I was hoping to get unbiased interpretations from people who may have had a broader experience than me, here in the channel of linguistics. If it had English as its root language, it would be recogniseable to English speakers, and yet here I stand, with no recognition of the name. So I am asking for others' opinions.
[12:52:30] <pussipupu> I'd pronounce it with the same vowel as the first vowel in Ghana
[12:52:59] <pussipupu> though I always wonder if -gh- words should have fricatives if they don't look like naturalised English words
[12:53:13] <Me-me> So, similar to "gave"?
[12:53:25] <Me-me> Or would it be more of a "gahv"?
[12:54:08] <pussipupu> more the latter 
[12:54:28] <pussipupu> I'm afraid I don't know IPA so can't really be precise
[12:54:36] <Me-me> I see. Aye, neither do I.
[12:58:05] <Black_Eagle> i say it's [gʰave] or [gʰa:ve] (personally preferring the former but "ghana" is a good approach
