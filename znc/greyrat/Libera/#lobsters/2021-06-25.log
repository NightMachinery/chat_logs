[01:06:30] <manicennui> Today a coworker said, "I would never run Java in docker."
[01:06:55] <manicennui> He really meant containers. I don't know where people get these crazy ideas.
[01:07:00] <manicennui> And why so many of them are about Java.
[01:07:25] <manicennui> Of course he also loves Go.

[01:56:56] <manicennui> Most lisps have a, I don't want to say popular, but somewhat well known?, logic library, including core.logic in Clojure.
[01:57:26] <manicennui> miniKanren in scheme
[01:57:31] <meff[m]> miniKanren?
[01:57:31] <meff[m]> yeah
[01:57:40] <companion_cube> that's still very different than prolog
[01:57:45] <meff[m]> ^
[01:58:09] <companion_cube> (and much slower)
[02:00:25] <badtuple> Does miniKanren work over a bunch of facts in the same way? I haven't used either, but my understanding was it tried to figure out a way to reason equationally over terms to fill in holes in your program.
[02:00:41] <badtuple> Not sure how true that is...just impressions I got from some random youtube stuff.
[02:03:42] <companion_cube> if you want sth cooler there's lambda prolog
[02:06:14] <riv> miniKanren is basically prolog but using a complete search instead - so it doesn't miss any positives
[02:06:19] <riv> and occurs check by default
[02:08:25] <companion_cube> it's probably cool if the backtracking search is < 1% of what you do
[02:08:38] <companion_cube> otherwise it'll still be a lot slower
[02:10:47] <riv> one of the really smart things i saw in minikanren was the disequality constraint
[02:11:02] <riv> there's no reason you can't do this in prolog but nobody seems to implement it there
[02:15:01] <companion_cube> does it mean not unifiable, or just not equal?
[02:15:29] <badtuple> and _what_ isn't equal? Like two predicates, or two items expected to be unified?
[02:16:07] <riv> not equal
[02:16:14] <riv> so a =/= b is true

[02:16:18] <riv> a =/= a is false
[02:16:28] <riv> but then it works on structures like pairs of objects too
[02:16:29] <companion_cube> what about `f(X)` adn `f(a)` under X->a ?
[02:16:44] <riv> f(X) =/= f(a) is equivalent to X =/= a
[02:16:57] <riv> f(X,Y) =/= f(a,b) is equivalent to X =/= a OR X =/= b
[02:16:58] <badtuple> I've got The Reasoned Schemer on my bookshelf...should pull it off the shelf and work through it. IIRC it builds up microKanren.
[02:17:18] <riv> whereas with unification, f(X,Y) =/= f(a,b) is equivalent to X = a AND Y = b
[02:17:27] <riv> so you have a de morgan thing going on
[02:17:55] <riv> yeah badtuple, that's a good book

[02:30:25] <companion_cube> riv: does it do the backtracking for the OR ?
[02:30:59] <riv> no, it's a constraint store
[02:31:07] <companion_cube> ah, well
[02:31:14] <companion_cube> most prolog have some constraints, don't they?
[02:31:14] <riv> so you actually have an AND of ORs of =/= constraints
[02:31:23] <companion_cube> some form of*
[02:31:24] <riv> yeah the = constraint is the most basic
[02:31:39] <riv> but then you can have advanced stuff like integers, finite domains, linear orderings

[02:35:21] <companion_cube> could be argued that Go is better for some things
[02:35:28] <companion_cube> like, well, shuffling byte arrays over sockets
[02:35:32] <badtuple> I mean, it's not a zero sum game. We get to have so many tools good at what they do :D
[02:35:49] <manicennui> badtuple: We mostly use a lot of bad tools that aren't terribly good at anything because they are popular.
[02:36:27] <badtuple> I mean, that's on you I guess. Use the best tools you can find.
[02:36:44] <badtuple> And if humanity keeps progressing, we'll keep getting better tools :D
[02:36:51] <manicennui> Is humanity progressing?
[02:36:58] <manicennui> Are we getting better tools?
[02:37:20] <badtuple> we're trying. It takes time, and it takes experimentation.

[06:38:47] <jj5> my favourite firefox about:config setting is network.http.sendRefererHeader = 0 which disables the HTTP REFERER header
[06:39:58] <epilys> might be that I was using debian stable's firefox... which is old, obviously
[06:40:24] <epilys> not a victimless crime; my microoptimising wasted so much time

[07:30:00] <companion_cube> I mean, if lobsters would only switch to mongoDB
[07:30:04] <companion_cube> it'd be webscale AF
[07:30:33] <badtuple> That was an interesting marketing term. Webscale.
[07:31:32] <badtuple> It just means very little, though kind of hints at real meaning. Like "can be exposed to the web without worry".
[07:34:32] <manicennui> If lobsters were written in Go this wouldn't happen.
[07:34:51] <craftyguy> or rust

[07:36:51] <manicennui> Even if the server is melted in a volcano, Rust servers will continue.
[07:37:48] <creature> It won't happen. The borrow checker detects volcano melting automatically, and raises a compile error.

[15:14:11] <wink> none of those were defining criteria for me

[15:15:04] <wink> so many apps have their own colorscheme or ui widget style anyway
[15:19:50] <besnn> hi wink
[15:20:00] <besnn> you're talking about win11?
[15:23:51] <wink> right now more about the diff. between 7 and 10 I guess
[15:24:26] <wink> win11 to me looks more like a win10 with a few backdrops to 7, and for ignaloidas it's more like 7 while retaining some 10 elements... I guess?
[15:24:33] <wink> not really worth fighting over :D
[15:25:49] <ignaloidas> wink, It is certainly a mix of the two, buy I do see it as a return to more win7-esque design

[20:08:10] <bsandro> i still avoid wifi where having consistent connection is crucial (like a console with fighting games on it :D )
[20:08:13] <gerikson> we had full cat5 coverage in the old apt but since we moved to another one we've not missed it
[20:08:41] <companion_cube> I think my newer laptop doesn't have an ethernet port :/
[20:08:45] <companion_cube> writing on the wall
[20:08:46] <lkhrs> I ran ethernet through the attic in my single-story house, it wasn't so bad - as long as the cables dropped down the wall in the right place
[20:09:32] <c355e3b> and the builder didn't do anything insane when putting the walls up
[20:09:42] <lkhrs> that too
[20:10:09] <manicennui> Single story is generally much easier.
[20:10:28] <bsandro> how do you guys deal with addressing lots of devices at home? trusting avahi or setting static ips?
[20:10:38] <c355e3b> really depends on the house
[20:11:16] <c355e3b> i've helped on houses where we could do everything pretty trivially by running along the ducts

[20:11:51] <c355e3b> flip side, there are cases where the house had spray insulation put into everything
[20:11:54] <c355e3b> and that was not good
[20:11:58] <Teckla> companion_cube: I guess you could always use a USB<->Ethernet dongle
[20:12:12] <Teckla> Like those MacBook folks have to use
[20:12:41] <bsandro> macbook folks have to use usb-c -> usb -> ethernet :)
[20:12:58] <manicennui> Nah, there are usb-c to ethernet dongles.
[20:13:12] <bsandro> well yeah but they're pricey and relatively rare
[20:13:35] <manicennui> It's rare to need ethernet, and we're rich.
[20:13:39] <manicennui> Obviously.
[20:13:52] <bsandro> and if you're using ethernet usually you want some more usb devices to use
[20:14:01] *** Joins: mercerist (~mercerist@user/mercerist)
[20:14:11] <bsandro> macbook airs have 2 ports overall for example, that's just so sad

[20:14:46] <manicennui> But haven't had a Mac with thunderbolt for a while.
[20:14:55] * Teckla has zero need for Ethernet
[20:15:06] <bsandro> that one I had too yeah, but apple ditched that socket for good
[20:15:26] <manicennui> Pretty common to just hook everything up to your monitor and then hook your monitor up to your Mac.
[20:16:03] <Teckla> I figure Ethernet is mostly for 1) people that legit need it (xfering large files and such) and 2) geeks that don't really need it but want it because it's "better" (same kind of people that run their own mail servers and such)
[20:16:33] <dutchie> do gaming type people still prefer wired for latency reasons?
[20:16:37] <manicennui> Pretty common for gamers to prefer it.
[20:16:38] <bsandro> yes
[20:16:49] <manicennui> Because the reason they suck is obviously latency.
[20:16:53] <bsandro> wifi lag spikes are still unavoidable
[20:16:56] <c355e3b> its also nice in high density environments
[20:16:58] <Teckla> manicennui: haha
[20:17:03] <manicennui> I like to let people know that I'm playing over wifi to upset them.
[20:17:06] <Teckla> I never have WiFi lag spikes.
[20:17:12] <bsandro> you do
[20:17:20] <Teckla> Although I live in a house far enough away from neighbors that their WiFi probably does not interfere.
[20:17:27] <c355e3b> wifi isn't the best when you have tons of devices that your neighbors threw up
[20:17:37] <lp0> You don't even need neighbors.
[20:17:52] * Teckla is also too old to play twitch games, so there's that.
[20:18:00] <bsandro> too many factors that wifi depends on, you can use it in a field with nothing in 500km around and there still will be lag spikes
[20:18:08] <manicennui> Too old?
[20:18:17] <bsandro> "twitch games"?
[20:18:23] <manicennui> I mean, I'm not going to go pro, but I do fine.
[20:18:30] <lp0> Work laptop dropped wifi regularly because of powere management, making it barely usable. Also, thanks Dell for going the Apple way with the XPS, no RJ45, not even USB. No wifi, no internet.
[20:18:55] <lp0> Good think I don't need to push gigs of docker images daily.
[20:19:00] <lp0> oh wait
[20:19:01] <manicennui> lp0: Disable the power management.
[20:19:17] <lp0> I did, works so much better.
[20:19:22] <manicennui> I've never seen wifi power management done in a way that is worth it.
[20:19:27] <manicennui> It is *always* just annoying.
[20:19:37] <lp0> It's still wifi though.
[20:20:10] <lp0> But wifi not working correctly by default, who thought of that ?
[20:20:22] <manicennui> Macs are the only machines/OS that I trust to do any kind of power management somewhat sanely.
[20:20:25] <lp0> iwlwifi bug ? hardware bug ? firmware bug ?
[20:20:46] <lp0> Was it intended behavior to drop connections randomly every few minutes ?
[20:24:17] <geoffwozniak> So I'm writing something that is very TDD friendly (a data structure thing) so I decided to use a TDD approach.  After getting into the system tests I realize I have a problem and basically the code for the data structure doesn't need too much to change, but the tests are basically all junk now
[20:24:44] <manicennui> heh
[20:24:50] <manicennui> I hate TDD.
[20:24:51] <lp0> That's why I think TDD is an extremism that needs to disappear.
[20:25:03] <lp0> Though I never saw it done.
[20:25:12] <manicennui> It seems like TDD is becoming more popular for some reason.
[20:25:18] <lp0> Never saw working tests when coming in a new company either.
[20:25:21] <geoffwozniak> I haven't even had a chance to do much TDD-ish lately, so I decided to give it a go
[20:25:29] <manicennui> It seemed to be mostly quarantined to the Ruby community before.
[20:25:35] <lp0> Nobody does tests except for maybe a few medium bloggers.
[20:26:00] <geoffwozniak> It certainly doesn't seem well suited to decent design, at least in this case
[20:26:04] <manicennui> I see a lot of job ads now that mention that they take TDD seriously.
[20:26:04] <bsandro> we worked heavily on tdd like 15-16 years ago on Rails, once i got into gamedev the whole paradigm stopped making any sense
[20:26:13] <hoistbypetard> manicennui: in the early 00s it was very popular with java folk
[20:26:26] <manicennui> I think TDD is fine when you work on a simple Rails app and you are like adding a new simple field to a screen.
[20:26:26] <hoistbypetard> it has not become unpopular
[20:26:36] <kline> right now the fetish is type systems

[20:27:07] <geoffwozniak> For those curious: the problem is that I need to move something to a three-valued logic system, which changes the semantics of most everything
[20:27:33] <manicennui> My method of development does not lend itself well to TDD.
[20:27:39] <hoistbypetard> TDD is very satisfying for fixing legit bugs
[20:27:47] <hoistbypetard> write a test to demonstrate the bug
[20:27:49] <hoistbypetard> then fix it
[20:27:51] <manicennui> It does lend itself well to a REPL based "interactive" development method.
[20:27:58] <geoffwozniak> I don't care for it, in general, and haven't found it to be very useful most of the time
[20:28:05] <manicennui> I tend to experiment and work things out first.
[20:28:07] <lp0> hoistbypetard that's not TDD, that's just testing.

[20:32:12] <manicennui> I had an interview with Pivotal where we did pair programming and used TDD.
[20:32:25] <manicennui> That is when I realized that I don't think that way, and it is kind of dumb when taken to the extreme.
[20:32:44] <manicennui> We literally did the "smallest change to make the test pass", which was hardcoding the value.
[20:32:55] <manicennui> Then several more rounds until we wrote the real code.
[20:33:04] <manicennui> Just complete nonsense.
[20:34:23] <hoistbypetard> yeah, i've seen people teach that
[20:34:31] <hoistbypetard> never seen anyone actually work that way :)
[20:34:48] <Brekkjern> I barely ever write a test :S
[20:35:18] <hoistbypetard> i've never given pairing an honest try. it doesn't seem good as a daily work habit to me.
[20:35:38] <hoistbypetard> (doing it some for cross-training has been beneficial before)
[20:35:41] <Brekkjern> Then again, I don't develop an actual product, but more automations
[20:36:39] <manicennui> Pairing is super exhausting for me.
[20:36:45] <manicennui> I could not do it for a large chunk of the day.
[20:36:52] <Brekkjern> Pairing is nice if the other person can pull their weight
[20:37:09] <Brekkjern> It's exhausting if they can't really think for themselves or keep up
[20:37:15] <edk> i don't mind pairing as a knowledge sharing exercise but i don't think it's very useful for getting stuff done
[20:38:32] <Teckla> Sometimes, you can write tests for your changes first.  Sometimes, you really have to write the tests for your changes after.  Anyone or place that insists "write tests first" or "write tests after" is just being inflexible and religious.

[21:30:13] <badtuple> Hmmm, has a programming language been made that explicitly prioritizes documentation? Like the Haskell and Rust folks do w/ types, but build things in a way that allows you to see more properties in the docs?
[21:31:04] <technomancy> badtuple: Racket
[21:31:05] <manicennui> Is there a programming language where literate programming is the default?
[21:31:07] <badtuple> (I understand that "Code mechanics" -> "properties from static analysis" -> "intent" -> "English expressing that intent" isn't necessarily possible...but I wanna know if someone tried)
[21:31:31] <manicennui> technomancy: Does it require docstrings or something?
[21:31:37] <badtuple> technomancy: Racket does? I'll have to take a look at it...I've heard alot of good things about it, but never that.
[21:32:06] <badtuple> I mean Rust has explicit doc comments that generate good docs, and can have tests and examples in them. But I'm thinking beyond literate programming with a generator.
[21:32:33] <badtuple> (Though comment tests is just about the coolest thing I know of to try to keep comments up to date, haha)
[21:33:02] <technomancy> manicennui: actually they don't have docstrings at all, but they have a strong culture and excellent tooling around separate documentation
[21:33:12] <technomancy> generating docs from source code is a big antipattern IMO
[21:33:20] <technomancy> (but docstrings in the repl are great)
[21:33:28] <manicennui> Ah.
[21:33:42] <manicennui> I think he meant somehow documentation is enforced by the compiler or something.

[21:34:17] <badtuple> Anti-pattern when bolted on...but with all the work with static analysis and stuff I'd be curious whether you could get much further with explicit language design and compiler support to do so.
[21:34:32] <badtuple> Less saying it's a good idea, more saying I wanna see the extremes in the design space

[21:56:44] <manicennui> Lock files make things reproducible. The only real argument I can see against them is that people don't update them often enough.
[21:56:56] <technomancy> your main dependency descriptor file should be enough; having two is dumb.

[21:57:44] <technomancy> manicennui: correct
[21:57:46] <technomancy> don't do that
[21:57:49] <manicennui> You'd have to require explicit versions.
[21:58:35] <manicennui> c355e3b: You generally shouldn't try to resolve merge conflicts. You should resolve conflicts in Gemfile and completely replace .lock.

[21:59:09] <c355e3b> manicennui: I'm aware, but that isn't always possible given how some team members have used the files in the past
[21:59:11] *** Joins: resistite (~resistite@86.106.121.175)
[22:00:12] <manicennui> technomancy: That works for top level dependencies, but what is the solution for all of the resolved dependencies?
[22:00:29] <badtuple> Forcing a strict version (not allowing patch updates) makes libraries alot heavier because you might rely on multiple versions of the same lib across deps.
[22:00:39] <manicennui> Just rely on them always being generated exactly the same way?
[22:01:07] <badtuple> Stuff like a serialization library or async lib might show up in multiple dependencies and it's nice (or sometimes required?) for those to agree.
[22:09:06] <companion_cube> technomancy: so in effect you're saying you write the lockfile yourself by hand
[22:09:11] <companion_cube> that's a choice I guess
[22:09:29] <companion_cube> (including, like manicennui says, all the transitive deps with their hash and version)
[22:09:35] <companion_cube> seems annoying to do tbh
[22:10:39] <technomancy> as long as the transitive deps are deterministic from the declared deps you don't need to specify them

[22:10:59] <companion_cube> how do you deal with diamonds
[22:11:08] <jasom> lock files and containers and such I have mixed feelings about; it makes it easy to make a dev environment that will work, but it also tends to cause the dev environment to be fragile; there is a lot of implicit testing of being robust to minor dependency changes when it's hard for developers to have a repeatable build environment.  I'm not saying we should go back, it would just be nice if there
[22:11:10] <jasom> were tools to capture some of what was lost.
[22:11:19] <technomancy> companion_cube: closer to the root of the dependency tree wins
[22:11:36] <companion_cube> so you literally ignore some constraints
[22:11:43] <companion_cube> I mean it it works for you, great :p
[22:11:49] <technomancy> companion_cube: if you need to override, you override
[22:11:59] <companion_cube> but to me it's the only way my rust programs keep compiling a year later
[22:12:19] <companion_cube> by having a reproducible set of dependencies
[22:12:26] <technomancy> it's foolish to say lockfiles are required for determinism
[22:12:33] <companion_cube> oh they're not strictly required
[22:12:36] <companion_cube> they're just super useful
[22:12:57] <technomancy> whatever problems they solve, I've never encountered them
[22:13:02] <jasom> if your reproducible set of dependencies is the only way to build the program than you are SOL if you want to incorporate something with conflicting dependencies.
[22:13:34] <companion_cube> if dependencies are conflicting then you cannot use these two things together
[22:13:36] <companion_cube> literally
[22:13:52] <companion_cube> technomancy: I don't have (good) lockfiles in OCaml and I feel the pain on a weekly basis
[22:13:59] <technomancy> I mean, lockfiles in rubygems solve teh problem of "rubygems was not designed with even the slightest bit of determinism in mind"
[22:14:03] <technomancy> so like ... just don't do that
[22:14:24] <jasom> when dependency management sucked a lot more, you'd get a developer who tried to compile on SuperBleedingEdgeUnstableLinuxDistro and get early warning of things that break if you were to upgrade dependencies.
[22:15:09] <technomancy> don't use a dependency model designed in the 90s, I guess
[22:15:17] <technomancy> rubygems was modeled on apt-get
[22:15:25] <companion_cube> I still want to hear what's more modern

[22:15:30] <manicennui> technomancy: Aren't you partially dependent on maven?
[22:15:31] <companion_cube> cause writing a lockfile myself doesn't seem good

[22:15:47] <companion_cube> idk how that works
[22:16:04] <technomancy> manicennui: yeah, we layer some extra anti-nondeterminism checks on top of maven
[22:16:05] <companion_cube> a comparison would be good?
[22:16:26] <jasom> There's always the Common Lisp solution: make sure that there are so few developers around that none of your dependencies ever change :)
[22:16:48] <companion_cube> or like C: make sure your dependencies have been developped for > 10 years and are thus stable
[22:16:56] <companion_cube> or: your deps are .h files you just vendor.

[22:19:30] <companion_cube> I guess it works in the jvm world, where libraries are huge and the stdlib has a bunch of stuff…

[22:20:26] <companion_cube> well, the whole AST is version locked

[22:21:30] <manicennui> It is more of a project management tool.
[22:21:42] <manicennui> And still seems to be the most popular one, although there are a couple other options now.
[22:21:59] <companion_cube> so, hum, the compatibility between libraries, in leiningen… is it all implicit??
