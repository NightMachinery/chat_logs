[20:37:38] <andreyorst> thankfully Emacs is not made with Electron, so only eats about 1.5GB when I'm working and I still have some RAM to open irc in it
[20:38:01] <andreyorst> memory this days, everything eats it...
[20:45:23] <TimMc> haha, what the hell are you doing to that poor emacs
[20:46:01] <ridcully_> foking electron apps?
[20:46:44] <TimMc> Emacs generally only uses around 100 MB on my machine, at most.

[21:04:00] <sailorCat> Hi, I've missed something very basic. There is a library https://clojars.org/ultra-csv. I made a project like `lein new app testdep` and add the library to project.clj as `:dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.10.0"] [ultra-csv "0.2.3"]]`. Then I run `lein repl` and type `(require '[ultra-csv])`. Expectation: I'll get a library to work with. Reality: `Could not locate ultra_csv__init.class, ultra_csv.clj or ultra_csv
[21:04:00] <sailorCat> classpath. Please check that namespaces with dashes use underscores in the Clojure file name`.
[21:04:20] <sailorCat> There is the library in my `~/.m2/repository/ultra-csv/ultra-csv`
[21:09:03] <Para> The namespace is ultra-csv.core
[21:09:42] <Para> So something like `(require '[ultra-csv.core :as ultra-csv])` should work
[21:09:55] <Para> https://github.com/ngrunwald/ultra-csv/blob/master/src/ultra_csv/core.clj
[21:10:14] <Para> the project readme omits this info as well, had to check the sources :)
[21:10:36] <sailorCat> Thanks, that was the problem.
[21:11:01] <Para> The {libraryname}.core as main namespace is quite a common convention

[21:27:36] <TimMc> And unfortunately, there's no particular relationship between the library's Maven coordinates and its package names/namespaces.
[21:35:50] *** Joins: elf_fortrez (~elf_fortr@adsl-72-50-7-8.prtc.net)
[21:35:55] <Para> Would be interesting to see the module system reused for that.
[21:36:06] <Para> But I doubt that'll happen :) it probably wouldn't be _that_ useful.
[21:39:20] <Para> Although thinking more out loud, since there's the whole build tooling project on-going, it wouldn't be totally out of realm of that to produce something like that...

[22:03:22] <technomancy> 1.5GB isn't so high for Emacs when it's been running for several months
[22:03:49] <technomancy> (but it's doing the work of at least five electron apps)
[22:04:48] <TimMc> And you're using it as window manager at the same time, yes?
[22:05:14] <technomancy> yes, and a mail client, and shell, and git client
[22:05:24] <technomancy> and PDF reader
[22:05:47] <technomancy> my IRC client is also emacs but it's on a remote machine so it doesn't get included in that number
[22:06:53] <TimMc> I've been thinking about switching to using emacs to hold my terminal sessions just so that I can interact with them fully from the keyboard (e.g. copy and paste of command output)
[22:07:11] <TimMc> that's how it starts, isn't it
[22:07:12] <technomancy> eshell is great if you don't use a lot of ncurses programs
[22:07:27] <technomancy> write a lisp function for your shell prompt
