[14:36:15] <Me-me> Not if it has hello in it.
[14:36:40] <no_gravity> Me-me: It does even when hello is in it. Because .* before the $ matches anything.

[14:37:33] <no_gravity> Now this is interesting.
[14:37:58] <no_gravity> So it works.
[14:38:00] <no_gravity> But why?
[14:38:20] <Me-me> Because (?!) is a negative lookahead. It will cause the match to fail if the contents within match.
[14:39:16] <no_gravity> But "^(?!.*hello)" means "must start with some string that does not contain "hello".
[14:39:26] *** Joins: lavaball (felix@31.204.155.215)
[14:39:28] <no_gravity> Or rather "does not end in hello".
[14:39:46] <NiLon> ^ and (?!.*hello) are seperate constructs
[14:39:54] <no_gravity> Sure
[14:40:50] <no_gravity> We agree that "(?!.*hello)" matches any string that does not contain 'hello'?
[14:41:21] <Me-me> More specifically, it matches any position within any string where there isn't a hello after that position.
[14:41:22] <NiLon> if you want to be strict about it, it actually doesn't match anything, but assert a condition
[14:41:48] <Me-me> ^ matches the start of the string, and $ matches the end.
[14:42:04] <no_gravity> Oh! That is my mistake!
[14:42:13] <no_gravity> The negative beast of course does not "match" anything.

[14:44:35] <Me-me> Goddamnit, bot.
[14:47:19] <NiLon> no_gravity could think it as that ^.*$ is the pattern, basically match anything
[14:48:01] <NiLon> but then you add an assertion to it (if condition) of (?!.*hello) that it must not include hello or the engine goes into failure state
[14:48:23] <NiLon> so the .* doesn't matter, because there is the failure state already
[14:48:53] <no_gravity> NiLon: Yes
[14:49:14] <NiLon> it is same as in programming you would have: assert(electricity = on); makeCoffee();
