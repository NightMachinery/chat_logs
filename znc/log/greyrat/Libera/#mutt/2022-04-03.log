[02:13:49] <lispmacs> hi, I'm a confused on how to send e-mail to a group. I found the -group option for alias to add somebody to a group, but I don't know how to send mail to the group
[03:00:10] <kevin8t8> lispmacs: for more info about groups see <http://www.mutt.org/doc/manual/#addrgroup>.  groups aren't used for email addressing - just use an alias for that.
