[00:01:44] *** Joins: AnselmoCampanas (~AnselmoCa@190.99.69.41)
[00:06:50] <Kaedenn> hmm, I added chrome/userChrome.css inside my profile directory and restarted firefox (with the about:config option set to true), and I see no change
[00:07:18] <Kaedenn> `:root { --arrowpanel-menuitem-spacing: 0px !important; }` is the only thing in that file
[00:07:28] <Kaedenn> How can I debug this?
[00:08:44] <Kaedenn> Oh wait!! The debugger lists userChrome.css; I probably just have a typo somewhere
[00:10:30] <Kaedenn> Odd, I added `#PlacesToolbar menuitem { padding: 0px !important; }` to the userChrome.css file and now, all of a sudden, it works. I guess there's more going on than I thought.
[00:11:57] <caveman> <mefistofeles> yet nobody cares   <---   not true.  some do care, just a minority.  the same minority that's least likely to use facebook/twitter/etc.  currently firefox seems to be made for the useless majority.  we should fix the majority with them.
[00:14:01] <Kaedenn> nemo: Thank you. I managed to get this working precisely as I desired.
[00:14:10] <Kaedenn> I'll continue playing with this

[00:50:10] <caveman> i want to create a new protocol that replaces http*, and others that replace html/css/js.  my goal is to ensure sanity and respect to the users.  one of the design goals is to let the server only send the data/content, and let the client render 100% handle how it should display/present the content.
[00:50:14] <caveman> i think this approach is very possible, since all website contents in the internet fall a few "classes" of contents.  so the server can simply specify the page's class, send the content, and let the client display it as the user wants.

[01:08:25] <nemo> web is officially CRLF
[01:08:26] <dTal> nemo is correct that gemini has the current mindshare for what you are trying to do
[01:08:38] <phy1729> have you seen HTTP or IRC?
[01:08:56] <caveman> nemo: this is part of the reason why the web is a bad place.  content should rather be sent in binary.
[01:09:01] <nemo> if you want to count characters in a textfield in javascript accurately you still have to do a \n to \r\n conversion
[01:09:19] <caveman> that's a big "if" statement that we don't need to have.
[01:09:29] <dTal> Why should content be sent in binary?
[01:09:35] <nemo> caveman: most content is in fact sent in binary these days. gzip compression
[01:09:43] <nemo> or other forms of compression
[01:09:43] <caveman> dTal: more efficient, and faster for cpus to jump around.
[01:09:46] <nemo> it's basically the default nowdays
[01:09:48] <dTal> I mean, binary content is sent in binary, and - yeah, gzip takes care of the rest.
[01:10:00] <caveman> nemo: that's only binary to compress, not binary to make parsing efficient after decompression.
[01:10:15] <caveman> dTal: ^ for you, too.
[01:10:56] <dTal> Hm. Is parsing efficiency a larger concern than human-readibility?
[01:11:17] <dTal> Probably yes, but that's the fundamental question.
[01:11:19] <caveman> no, but wrong question.  not mutually exclusive.  simpler parsing is also less code -> less bugs.
[01:11:56] <caveman> it's a lie that "text-based protocols are easier to debug".  we just need a debugger for that binary protocol.
[01:12:08] <dTal> ...how do you have human-readable binary protocols? I'm not C3PO
[01:12:27] <dTal> using a special tool is not "human readable", it's machine-readable
[01:12:31] <caveman> shipping a text-based protocol for the masses, is like distributing binary software with debugging information compiled.  this is bad, debugging must be for devs only.
[01:12:50] <caveman> dTal: look at wireshark.  doesn't it make, say, tcp human readable?
[01:12:52] <dTal> that's the whole point, you are proposing changing from human-readable to machine-readable. They are mutually exclusive.
[01:13:04] <dTal> You are misusing the term.
[01:13:31] <dTal> If anything that can be parsed and rendered is "human readable", then everything is human readable.
[01:13:41] <caveman> nope.  html/css/js is not meant to be read by humans.  so why make it in text, and not compile it in binary?  what is human-readable is the post-rendering/compilation.
[01:14:02] <dTal> ...it is meant to be read by humans. It's source code.

[01:15:12] <caveman> debugging mode must not be turned on for production.
[01:15:29] <caveman> currently, the text-based web works as if we have enabled debugging-mode universally for everyone.
[01:15:34] <dTal> What we have is a system that can convert the human-readable source code into a binary stream for transmission.
[01:15:43] <dTal> It's called "gzip"
[01:16:07] <caveman> gzip only optimises transmission.  does not optimise post-decompression parsing.
[01:16:25] <dTal> You could compile it into a binary AST and send that, and that's a valid design decision, but it's user hostile.
[01:16:39] <caveman> we need both to be binary:  content to be compressed (e.g. gzip), and the protocol itself to be binary.
[01:16:41] <dTal> That's an explicit design decision to disenfranchise the end user.
[01:17:29] <caveman> compile html into abstract syntax tree?
[01:17:56] <dTal> Well, yes. That's what you're proposing? A binary representation?

[01:18:16] <dTal> pre-parsed, even?
[01:18:30] <caveman> no, that's not what i'm proposing.  but yes, that will only solve parsing speed.
[01:18:50] <caveman> the problem with that approach (compiled html) is that it does not separate content from presentation.
[01:19:01] <dTal> Well, I'm not sure what you're proposing then. Perhaps write a demo so we can see what you're talking about?

[01:19:29] <caveman> it's simple to describe.  i'll rephrase it.  
[01:20:08] <caveman> basically, you understood the parsing optimisation part.  but you missed the part about making servers only supply content, with 0% decision about the presentation.  
[01:20:42] <caveman> so, a website designer, will simply supply content, and content class.  that's it.  then the client will render the content.
[01:21:14] <caveman> content class could be like:  articles, chat, etc.
[01:21:30] <dTal> Can the text be formatted?
[01:21:52] <dTal> Can we have different heading sizes?
[01:22:00] <dTal> Fonts?
[01:22:02] <caveman> no.  formatting is something that only the client does.  the server has no clue about client's rendering abilities.
[01:22:03] <dTal> Embedded images?
[01:22:21] <caveman> yes, you can have different everything, but this is a decision by the viewer client.
[01:22:25] <dTal> Well, this sounds like a nonstarter.
[01:22:50] <caveman> why?
[01:22:58] <dTal> You need to give people the tools to typeset properly. It's a vital component of written text.
[01:23:17] <dTal> And once they have those tools, they can use them to present arbitrary content.
[01:23:27] <dTal> Which brings you back to HTML, and the Web.
[01:23:52] <caveman> typesetting doesn't need formatting.  you only need to specify semantics.  e.g. emphasise this word.  this word is a heading, etc.
[01:24:23] <dTal> Remember that HTML is also an attempt to delegate a large amount of overridable rendering choices to the client. You can supply your own CSS, you can resize your window, there's a lot of dynamic stuff going on you don't get with, say, PDF or .docx

[13:44:31] <BaronVladimirHar> The "apps" can just be a stub that grabs some other binaries from the web just like you could.
[13:44:42] <BaronVladimirHar> In fact, that's how Firefox can be installed.

[13:46:17] <BaronVladimirHar> Installing Firefox and foobar2000 from the store, and you don't get code audits and centralized updates.
[13:46:58] <BaronVladimirHar> You get the same binaries (minus features maybe) you could from the web, and their own update methods, or maybe no updates at all (just like Windows 10).
[13:47:19] <BaronVladimirHar> It's a disjointed mess.
[13:47:46] <BaronVladimirHar> The Firefox Updater Service is just a nasty piece of work.
[13:48:08] <BaronVladimirHar> An entire system service to make sure one program is up to date and to suppress security alerts that it's being updated.

[13:49:46] <BaronVladimirHar> Back to Python though, I'm glad I never became really interested in that.

[13:52:03] <BaronVladimirHar> And Rust sounds like it brings in a lot of potential hazards too.

[13:52:49] <BaronVladimirHar> Things that will stop working and require you to go back and mess with things you battened down previously and which would have been a solved problem forever had you used C.
[13:53:30] <BaronVladimirHar> It doesn't sound like they fixed anything that Linus Torvalds complained about with C++ and Boost.
[13:53:43] <oneforall2> never really like python either overiding is a pain .. expecially on a multilib system 
[13:53:57] <BaronVladimirHar> They just took over Linux and made it so anyone who complains about Rust is transphobic by default.

[13:56:08] <oneforall2> still a bit of hard coding lib  dir  
[13:56:20] <BaronVladimirHar> I mean, there will still be some of this "Hold onto your lugnuts, it's TIIIIIME for an undocumented code dump!" because they have to port over Linux drivers sometimes.
[13:56:36] <BaronVladimirHar> But at least the Microsoft invasion of Linux will be mostly kept at bay.
[13:57:16] <BaronVladimirHar> I love Intel and AMD!
[13:58:04] <BaronVladimirHar> There's all of about 5 people in the world that understand how their drivers work. There's no commenting or whitespace. It doesn't even function without binary-only firmware..... "Open Source"
[13:58:50] <BaronVladimirHar> Unfortunately everything I've just said is how Mozilla operates these days too. Or worse.
[13:59:32] <BaronVladimirHar> Unsupportable code and programming languages. Obfuscation. Hide what it does from the user (DRM blobs). Microsoft/Google takeover (money, corruption, etc.).
[14:00:27] <BaronVladimirHar> * corruption, etc.). Backdoors (Normandy, experiments....). Spyware. (Suggest.)
[14:02:02] <BaronVladimirHar> It's just unbelievable what has happened to computing. having learned nothing about the marvels of code that still compiles decades down the line, perhaps with minor tweaks for current compilers, they set out to make a mess where the compiler gets bumped and you're in there rewriting half the goddamned program.
[14:03:35] <BaronVladimirHar> People made the mistake of writing a lot of Python2 stuff, and a lot of it hasn't been ported and never will be ported.
[14:03:57] <BaronVladimirHar> Even if the author was interested, maybe they're dead now and nobody else wants to step up and maintain it.
[14:08:01] <BaronVladimirHar> I just don't see the point in constantly having to revisit solved problems.
[14:08:46] <BaronVladimirHar> And I think a lot of the people "wanting" Rust in the Linux kernel are Microsoft "engineers" who would love nothing more than to have Linux developers bogged down constantly messing with things that are already there instead of being able to work on something else.
[14:10:10] <BaronVladimirHar> This whole thing should be killed before there's ever a single line of Rust in kernel space.

[14:12:33] <BaronVladimirHar> The way it looks to me is if you avoid the parts that are going to break down from time to time and result in this sort of thing, Rust can't actually do more than C can. It brings very little upside to kernel development.
[14:13:00] <BaronVladimirHar> There's safe and unsafe, but it's a kernel and kernels have to do a lot of stuff where you'll be using unsafe anyway.
[14:13:58] <BaronVladimirHar> RedoxOS already has over 16,000 source lines of kernel code that are using unsafe and it doesn't even really do anything yet, and  doesn't have drivers, and doesn't run on real hardware.

[14:18:25] <BaronVladimirHar> To be fair, they really do.
[14:18:47] <BaronVladimirHar> But CPAN is so large, that Fedora does not package anywhere close to all of it in RPM format.
[14:19:38] <BaronVladimirHar> So when I was trying to assemble something in PERL years back, I frequently had to give up on Fedora's packages of PERL modules and just use CPAN directly.
[14:20:12] <BaronVladimirHar> It ultimately ended up being a mound of trash that would have been better off being a collection of shell scripts and standard unix utilities.

[14:40:31] <oneforall2> hmm have't tried that one yet just youtube-dl and you-get 
[14:41:25] <oneforall2> need to go to bed will try it later .. have the error you were gettting ?
[14:41:35] <ede> oneforall2: youtube throttles 3rd party clients for some months already, yt-dlp is a fork for the atm unmaintained youtube-dl with a workaround.
[14:41:43] <oneforall2> if so pastebin it :)
[14:42:06] <ede> there was a MACRO left in ./configure from ./configure.ac, should be fixed now
[14:42:45] <ede> i commented it out, it built, but no ssl. which is a bit suboptimal on a mostly https-only web :)
[14:44:33] <oneforall2> ah yeah had to get a few patches for other apps too ., or just python3 -c 'import site; print(site.getsitepackages()[0])'   python3 -c 'import sys; print(sys.version)' | cut -f 1,2 -d .  as work arounds :) 
[14:46:38] <Timvde> BaronVladimirHar: apart from the one big change from 2 to 3, Python is relatively backwards compatible. They also supported Python 2 for over a decade after the Python 3 release. You definitely don't have to rewrite your software all the time.
[14:47:09] <oneforall2> iin a FLAG 
[14:47:29] <ede> the only workaround i had to do was changing the hashbang in youtube-dl to python3. imagine editing a zip file preceded by a line of text in a text editor and not breaking it. still amuses me.
[14:47:57] <Timvde> And Rust is better than C++ in *many* ways. Whether those changes are relevant to Linux, I don't know, and it doesn't matter. Rust is not created for Linux. But the fact that Linus *is* looking into merging kernel modules that are written in Rust, is kinda huge.
[14:48:46] <oneforall2> Timvde yeah as I look at setuptools and the fauct that python 3.10 should still be compiling this since it doesn't get dropped to 3.12  
[14:49:15] <Cork> it's actually google taking on rust in a big way that is the cause of that so its more like google > android > linux
[14:49:52] <Cork> and linus torvald is not against using rust, compared to many other languages (line c++) been asked about before
[14:49:53] <ede> to be fair, 2 to 3 is a major change. still less problematic that gtk changes of minor what i've heard ;)
[14:50:46] <BaronVladimirHar> 10 years from now when we find out how Rust in the kernel went with "Jesus, and now we're busy writing that all over again, in C"....
[14:50:59] <oneforall2> I'm starting to think its because its not installing mach.pth since there is no /tmp/firefox-94.0/obj/_virtualenvs/build/lib/python3.10/site-packages/  its in lib64 
[14:51:04] <BaronVladimirHar> Oh well.
[14:51:25] <Timvde> oneforall2: yes, there are some well-announced deprecations which could still break some scripts.
[14:51:28] <ede> 10 years ago i had XP installed. 10 more years ago i was using SE. another 10 years back it was DOS.
[14:51:33] <oneforall2> I looked and there is no mach.pth there iether 
[14:51:41] <BaronVladimirHar> The majority of people working on it these days are corporate types shoving in things that don't directly concern me. I don't care what they write Hype-V drivers in.
[14:52:05] <Timvde> BaronVladimirHar: I personally hope that C will get phased out over time
[14:52:09] <Timvde> It's a horrible language
[14:52:11] <ede> ey!

[14:53:10] <Timvde> You said that Rust can't actually do more than C can, but well, the opposite is true too
[14:53:16] <Timvde> C can't do anything more than Rust can
[14:53:22] <Timvde> But it's generally nicer to do in Rust
[14:53:29] <ede> C is a bit aged after all
[14:53:34] <Timvde> "A bit"
[14:53:39] <ede> a lot has changed since the days it was designed
[14:54:08] <ede> people still learn latin and greek at schools, so no need to remove it
[14:55:01] <Timvde> C was a great language for its time, it has earned its spot and defended it well over the years

[14:57:52] <BaronVladimirHar> 600 MB browser tabs
[14:57:53] <ede> a simple CPU, not loaded with a dozen of addressing schemes, but has all the basics. easy to learn by design.
[14:57:59] <Timvde> After 50 years of writing C, people are still writing memory-related bugs
[14:58:02] <oneforall2> Tried have this argument with Linus ") since last I herd he love C
[14:58:06] <Timvde> Maybe that indicates that the language is hard to use (safely) :)
[14:58:11] <BaronVladimirHar> Not the entire browser uses 600 MB of RAM.
[14:58:14] <BaronVladimirHar> One tab.
[14:58:16] <Timvde> BaronVladimirHar: yea, I don't like that either
[14:58:18] <BaronVladimirHar> From the people who brought you Ruse.
[14:58:23] <BaronVladimirHar> s/Ruse/Rust/
[14:58:31] <Timvde> But that is completely unrelated to Rust
[14:58:32] <ede> they all have to learn it individually, unfortunately we have no hive mind :)
[14:58:40] <Timvde> The JS ecosystem is just horrible
[14:58:58] <Timvde> And web technologies are abused a lot
[14:59:06] <oneforall2> even cars etc still use the wheel 
[14:59:12] <Timvde> Just installing an adblocker brings down your memory usage by an insane amount
[14:59:21] <BaronVladimirHar> That probably explains why competing browsers use up 1/4 of the RAM of Firefox with the same sites loaded up.
[14:59:21] <susi> oneforall2: except for teslas
[14:59:49] <Timvde> oneforall2: Linus is very pragmatic. He knows the pros and cons of C. He is not against using other languages, *if* they provide an actual benefit
[14:59:50] <ede> webdesigners (notice i don't call them devs) too often just throw in everything they get their hands on and fix their own inabilities by scripting around the gaps.
[14:59:53] <susi> I have no issues with memory usage of Firefox and I have less than 4G of available ram
[14:59:59] <BaronVladimirHar> It's probably a number of things, including sleeping and lazy loading combined with overall better memory management in Chromium browser.
[15:00:05] <BaronVladimirHar> s/browser/browsers/
[15:00:15] <BaronVladimirHar> I open up Firefox, soon it's using 8-10 GB.
[15:00:18] <ede> oneforall2: soon we'll have air taxis! they promised!
[15:00:20] <BaronVladimirHar> I do the same stuff in Vivaldi, it uses 2.
[15:00:41] <susi> BaronVladimirHar: maybe let it discard inactive tabs from memory
[15:00:51] <BaronVladimirHar> I just doubt Mozilla is profiling their code. Too busy adding spyware and junk.
[15:01:01] <Timvde> Yes, Chromium discards inactive tabs from memory
[15:01:10] <Timvde> Mozilla is working on that too, it will land soon-ish
[15:01:12] <ede> susi: with 2G it's easy to use them all after a few minutes with youtube, twitter, facebook... also some shopping systems, even blogs.
[15:01:14] <Timvde> After fission, though
[15:01:14] <BaronVladimirHar> I really do wonder how Debian is going to handle this spyware mess.
[15:01:22] <susi> Timvde: it works for me, has worked since v90
[15:01:29] <oneforall2> yeah I think I'll be dead before they let us buy the air cars at an almost affordable price too:)
[15:01:35] <mannequin> mozilla gets very sluggish when i get political
[15:01:41] <BaronVladimirHar> We have a while before they have to make a decision about this. 91 ESR hasn't even landed yet, and that doesn't have it.
[15:01:42] <ede> fission as in firefox+chrome?
[15:01:46] <Timvde> BaronVladimirHar: By disabling the compile-time flag to include telemetry, probably?
[15:01:50] <Timvde> I mean, it's not hard
[15:02:02] <Timvde> ede: fission as in a separate process per domain
[15:02:03] <oneforall2> I remeber when ge didn't have nice works for C++ 
[15:02:06] <ede> ah :)
[15:02:11] <BaronVladimirHar> Telemetry is on by default, I think.
[15:02:17] <Timvde> BaronVladimirHar: in Mozilla builds, yes
[15:02:21] <Timvde> debian creates their own builds
[15:02:29] <Timvde> It's just a single flag to disable all of it
[15:02:32] <BaronVladimirHar> Debian ran into a problem with Mozilla's lawyers coming after them before, which resulted in the rebranding incident.
[15:02:45] <BaronVladimirHar> So does turning off the Suggest crapware get them the same treatment?
[15:02:50] <Timvde> That was about the Firefox trademark, and they came to an agreement now
[15:02:51] <susi> I've read the discussion about this trademark issue
[15:03:01] <susi> it wasn't that 'their lawyers came after them'
[15:03:10] <Timvde> And yea, I think debian just did that out of caution
[15:03:13] <oneforall2> hey I noticed to that ff etc still download pip,setuptools and they are older than what I have .. 
[15:03:38] <BaronVladimirHar> They should Iceweasel it again and just patch all of these nonsense out.
[15:03:55] <mannequin> it's just debian folks wanting to have full controll over the code
[15:03:58] <BaronVladimirHar> Then Mozilla has no say over what makes it "Firefox", and so no nasty letters from the lawyers.
[15:04:11] <Timvde> BaronVladimirHar: And debian will, if they deem it necessary
[15:04:40] <BaronVladimirHar> mannequin: Well, Mozilla wants their junk and nasty spyware on. I think they'll try to force the issue if anyone turns it off and still calls it Firefox.
[15:04:42] <Timvde> And I'm pretty sure they know better than you do, so if they don't, it's probably because whatever Mozilla is doing, is actually not so horrible
[15:04:54] <ede> what i've read mozilla didn't like them to patch it, remove the icon for freedom reasons and still call it firefox
[15:04:54] <mannequin> what freaking spyware
[15:05:01] <Timvde> mannequin: he's talking about telemetry
[15:05:10] <BaronVladimirHar> Timvde: Or because the Debian maintainers don't care.
[15:05:11] <Timvde> Because he doesn't understand what it actually is
[15:05:17] <Timvde> BaronVladimirHar: Trust me, they very much do.
[15:05:18] <BaronVladimirHar> Firefox is already DFSG incompatible.
[15:05:51] <BaronVladimirHar> It has a DRM blob grabber which pesters the user incessantly until they install Widevine without explaining the ethical and security implications.
[15:06:30] <oneforall2> there is a checkbox to enable/disable that 
[15:06:38] <ede> it pops even up when you reach facebook. and i don't mean a video but also the login. so much to their code quality :P
[15:06:49] <BaronVladimirHar> There is no checkbox to stop Firefox from popping it up again.
[15:07:05] <BaronVladimirHar> In Vivaldi, uncheck the box, no Widevine ever again.
[15:07:19] <BaronVladimirHar> Yes, fingerprinting malware uses Widevine.

[15:08:15] <BaronVladimirHar> It would be nice if someone could make it look like Widevine loaded successfully to the script when Widevine isn't there.
[15:08:31] <BaronVladimirHar> Widevine not loading would make you more unique because most people are fools and leave it on.
[15:08:37] <ede> is this the open264 something by cisco?
[15:08:50] <BaronVladimirHar> No, that's entirely different.
[15:08:57] <BaronVladimirHar> That's just an AVC codec.
[15:09:00] <ede> ah ok
[15:09:03] <BaronVladimirHar> It has nothing to do with DRM.
[15:09:52] <ede> i wanted to check the checkbox thing, went to fb login, for a second a thing similar to bookmarker hung down from the bar with yes/no or sth and then disappeared
[15:09:56] <BaronVladimirHar> Firefox losing users makes people who use Firefox more unique to fingerprinters.
[15:10:07] <ede> couldn't even read the text. also doesn't pop up anymore.
[15:10:25] <BaronVladimirHar> If only 3% of web users still run Firefox, then Chromium useragents are generally less useful to fingerprinters for that part.
[15:10:52] <BaronVladimirHar> Then there's "Do Not Track", which helps fingerprinters track you.
[15:11:00] <BaronVladimirHar> Because it also adds uniqueness.
[15:11:02] <ede> used to have 25% here on the desktop. before chrome started up and IE was #1
[15:11:23] <BaronVladimirHar> How do you catch a unique rabbit? Unique up on it!
[15:12:09] <BaronVladimirHar> ede: Yeah, the fingerprinting script I ran into was on Reddit.
[15:12:14] <BaronVladimirHar> It poked around for a lot of stuff.
[15:12:27] <ede> years ago some suggested to use https only and encrypt all mails. just to help the people who MUST do it disappear in the crowd.
[15:12:38] <BaronVladimirHar> One part was trying to load Widevine, crApple FoulPlay, and Microsoft Fails For Sure.
[15:13:08] <ede> security and privacy settings should all be on 100%
[15:13:13] <BaronVladimirHar> Then another one was checking what fonts you had, and then it went on to try to exploit some bugs in Internet Explorer's Javascript engine.
[15:13:28] <ede> with an easy to use interface to manage it and userfacing docs
[15:13:29] <BaronVladimirHar> By running some math calculations that would result in rounding errors, but only on IE.
[15:13:45] <ede> but firefox and interfaces, yeah.
[15:14:29] <BaronVladimirHar> Microsoft is infamous for floating point rounding errors for some reason.
[15:14:41] <ede> the calculator?
[15:14:56] <ede> only in default mode and they wanted to have it like that
[15:15:05] <BaronVladimirHar> Well, calc32.exe anyway.
[15:15:25] <BaronVladimirHar> But Excel has errors.
[15:15:35] <BaronVladimirHar> One of them changed a report to Congress to make it look like the national debt would hurt GDP growth more than it really would.
[15:15:40] <ede> found some calculator collector recently, he ran some tests on some of his devices using the same chip
[15:15:41] <Timvde> Excel is *not* made for any serious work
[15:15:42] <BaronVladimirHar> Given the assumptions made in other cells.
[15:16:05] <ede> there were *still* differences because maybe just another chip generation
[15:16:38] <BaronVladimirHar> Excel shaved almost half a point off the US GDP growth projection under the "high debt" scenerio.
[15:16:41] <ede> the best reason to use MS Office is because your boss made the IT guy install it on all the machines
[15:16:42] <BaronVladimirHar> And then the Republicans said, "See, we have to cut Social Security benefits!".
[15:17:31] <BaronVladimirHar> The reality was GDP would suffer under the high debt assumption, but by only a third of the amount that Excel said it would.
[15:17:37] <ede> lol w/o excel they would even have blamed the weekly tornado.
[15:18:01] <BaronVladimirHar> And then it gave the Republicans their ammunition for Starve Grandma. Don't worry about all these nukes we don't need that we have laying around, or the F-35 that doesn't work.
[15:18:35] <ede> or the jets making half a roll after crossing the equator? :P
[15:19:12] <BaronVladimirHar> Irony is calling a plane that can't fly near a thunderstorm the "Lightning".
[15:19:43] <BaronVladimirHar> Not only can it not fly in the storm, it can't fly 25 miles from the storm.
[15:19:44] <BaronVladimirHar> :)
[15:19:57] <ede> it's a message to the storm, "don't hit me, i'm on your side!"
[15:20:20] <BaronVladimirHar> This thing is the Space Shuttle of fighter jets.
[15:20:23] <BaronVladimirHar> It's awful.
[15:20:49] <BaronVladimirHar> And after throwing $2 trillion away on it, it's time to order more jets that were basically designed in the 1970s and Starve Grandma.
[15:21:51] <BaronVladimirHar> It's actually kind of funny, you know, in a tragic sort of way.
[15:22:18] <BaronVladimirHar> Everyone forgets all of the lessons they should have learned. Decides they'll start over and design everything correctly this time.
[15:22:57] <BaronVladimirHar> And that's where incompatible breakage comes into play in software.
[15:23:18] <BaronVladimirHar> And they only end up making more mistakes.
[15:25:42] <ede> BaronVladimirHar: get used to trillins and even quindecillions and start playing swarmsim :P
[15:26:27] <BaronVladimirHar> Oh I know. I'd love to have a counterfeiting press in my kitchen, which is basically how the government funds itself. :)
[15:26:37] <BaronVladimirHar> Oh, I spent too much this month? Hang on a minute!
[15:27:49] <BaronVladimirHar> The funny part is that during the American Revolution, the British counterfeited our money as a form of harassment and to undermine the US economy.
[15:28:02] <BaronVladimirHar> Now we let those idiots in Washington do it to ourselves. 
[15:28:55] <BaronVladimirHar> "Universal Pre-K". Gotta start early or they may never worship the state.
[15:30:09] <ede> didn't Japan do the same during WW2?
[15:30:41] <ede> but then as long as i can remember it was known that the presidents were just too easy to clone.
[15:31:46] <BaronVladimirHar> IDK. I know North Korea creates counterfeit hundreds now.
[15:32:39] <ede> still the design from 100 years ago?
[15:35:04] <BaronVladimirHar> Well, you could technically use any design that's likely to still be out there in large amounts and not draw too much attention.
[15:35:30] <BaronVladimirHar> The Federal Reserve tries to destroy and reissue banknotes to keep the higher value ones up to date.
[15:35:43] <BaronVladimirHar> But anything ever issued by the US government is still worth at least face value.
[15:37:00] <BaronVladimirHar> If you were going to use an older design or didn't want to attract too much attention, a $5 or $10 would be a more logical choice.
[15:37:12] <BaronVladimirHar> Not as many security features, nobody is likely to check them closely.
[15:37:30] <BaronVladimirHar> I've had cashiers try to hand me counterfeit bills before.
[15:38:25] <BaronVladimirHar> When I refused to accept it and demanded another one, various conversations occurred.
[15:39:38] <ede> in the 90s iirc it was the 50DM banknote, and now 20€. but i usually pay the groceries with 50€ and they don't even check it.
