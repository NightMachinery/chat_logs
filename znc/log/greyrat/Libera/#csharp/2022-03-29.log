[00:32:24] <Suchiman> and the builtin bridge rectifier would prolly deliver too many volts then

[02:07:36] <Cecen> The obsolete attribute doesn't apply to the implementation of the interface
[02:08:38] <Cecen> So there's no way to deprecate an interface member that originally provided information but was moved elsewhere, leaving the consumers' implementations to happily compile despite being non-functional at runtime
[02:08:43] <lz_> lol then just remove the member?
[02:08:50] <Cecen> It still compiles
[02:09:05] <Guest87> Thanks JakeSays
[02:09:11] <lz_> it won't compile if the implementations are explicit
[02:09:24] <lz_> which they should be
[02:09:57] <lz_> and if they're not then it's the consumer's problem
[02:11:15] <Cecen> Nobody implements interfaces explicitly unless they need to
[02:11:33] <lz_> what? it's litterally the default for autocompletion
[02:12:00] <lz_> if you click "implement", intellisense makes everything explicit, as it should be
[02:12:59] <Cecen> It doesn't
[02:13:06] <Cecen> You probably have some setting changed
[02:13:50] <lz_> I checked in vs 2022 and there are both options (I could swear if was always explicit before but maybe I'm wronG)
[02:14:37] <lz_> anyway, my point still stands: if the consumer didn't make it explicit, it's his problem. He may even need to keep the non explicit stuff around

[09:55:31] <smallville7123> "A friend assembly is an assembly that can access another assembly's internal (C#) or Friend (Visual Basic) types and members. If you identify an assembly as a friend assembly, you no longer have to mark types and members as public in order for them to be accessed by other assemblies. This is especially convenient in the following scenarios:
[09:55:32] <smallville7123>     During unit testing, when test code runs in a separate assembly but requires access to members in the assembly being tested that are marked as internal in C# or Friend in Visual Basic."

[12:49:22] <Booster2ooo> I would like to declare a property of an interface as being a limited list of possible string, like an enum in a way. In typescript, it would be `interface IFoo { public bar: 'first' | 'second' | 'third'; }` or `public enum Bar { first = 'first', second = 'second', third = 'third' } interface IFoo { bar: Bar }` but I don't see how to do that in C#, any suggestion?
[12:50:38] <Booster2ooo> I was thinking about using a static class with const properties but that doesn't allow me to type the "bar" property of the example, bar will have to be a string which is too loose to my taste
[12:52:26] <Booster2ooo> An enum and a setter for Bar that shadows the enum value ... *pukes a little*
[12:52:45] <alguien> My migration alters a column type and attempts to make it a foreign key. This fails saying there's a type mismatch between the foreign key and the column it references, revealing its type has not been changed.

[13:17:40] <canton7> smallville7123_, that seems like an unnecessarily expensive way to go about things
[13:17:57] <smallville7123_> this is for a type information structure
[13:18:38] <canton7> smallville7123_, what's your definition of Group?
[13:19:21] <canton7> I'd probably keep a Dictionary<Type, Group> -- that lets you do that logic in O(n) rather than O(n^2)

[13:44:11] <smallville7123_> should c be considered a subgroup of a ?
[13:44:21] <MatthiasVance> It's your application.. you tell us?
[13:44:35] <smallville7123_> MatthiasVance: i dont know
[13:45:27] <MatthiasVance> Then how are we supposed to know?
[13:45:29] <MatthiasVance> xD
[13:46:48] <smallville7123_> well a TestGroup is meant to be isolated like a Test, so it could be possible to virtually subgroup 'c' with 'a' ?
[13:47:51] <smallville7123_> since 'c' should not depend on 'b' to be able to run, right?
[13:48:52] <smallville7123_> so.... this complicates things...
[13:50:31] <smallville7123_> and the same would also apply to Tests aswell right?
[13:51:14] <MatthiasVance> smallville7123_: Again, it depends on *your* requirements?
[13:51:16] <smallville7123_> eg   class a : g { class b { class c : t { public override void Run{} } } }
[13:52:38] <smallville7123_> 'c' would become a test of group 'a' as per top-level test discovery rules (eg, a test CAN be inside a class and it should still be findable)

[14:11:25] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: Ah :D Nice!
[14:13:04] <JakeSays> smallville7123_: it's actually not a parent class you're looking for. it's a particular base class. what you wrote will find a class that can be assigned typeGroup, which isn't exactly the same as looking for a specific type
[14:13:18] <JakeSays> *assigned to
[14:13:33] <smallville7123_> yea
[14:13:56] <JakeSays> to find a specific type, do currentType == typeGroup
[14:15:26] <JakeSays> smallville7123_: you can also simplify the code slightly by getting rid of the null check and then changing type.DeclaringType to type?.DeclaringType
[14:16:08] <smallville7123_> also currentType = currentType.DeclaringType;
[14:16:19] <smallville7123_> otherwise it will loop forever
[14:16:41] <JakeSays> ah. no, that should be currentType = currentType?.declaringType

[18:08:45] <jmer> So... We have a bunch of DTOs that are used in various services.
[18:09:33] <jmer> Currently it's a monolith so ofc. it's easy for them to share these DTOs but we need to split our codebase up into smaller portions. Right now I'm kinda of the mind of just "duplicating" the DTO into each service and then slim them down removing all that isn't necessary for each specific service.
[18:09:44] <jmer> the DTOs*
[18:10:22] <jmer> Alternatively we could create the DTOs as a Nuget and share them, but I can see a whole bunch of downsides without any real benefits
[18:13:18] <interop_madness> with typescript, there would be Required<T> and Pick<T> to express this problem
[18:14:09] <interop_madness> seems like a bad fix server-side. it's bad to make all properties optional to satisfy all services. it's bad to duplicate all DTOs for each service.
[18:15:28] <interop_madness> I would probably opt for duplicating them, removing unnecessary stuff per service and introduce some kind of build step that ensures consistency across these DTOs (if it is required)
[18:16:07] <interop_madness> consistency i.e. build fails if someone alters a property name for just one of these DTOs if other services rely on the same property
[18:16:49] <Guest87> jmer: yes I am normal thanks
[18:17:04] <jmer> Then I am perfectly OK with being weird. :D
[18:18:38] <jmer> interop_madness: Not so much all properties. More that some "duplication" of DTOs across services should be OK, because there's a potential they might evolve in different directions

[18:26:35] <Guest87> I wouldn't
[18:26:49] <jmer> I could easily see a DTO change in Service1 that, even though Service2 uses the same (or very similar) DTO Service2 doesn't care about that change

[18:38:29] <JakeSays> jmer: if you're going away from a monolithic service then i wouldn't share dtos
[18:38:55] <jmer> JakeSays: thanks!
[18:39:25] <jmer> I think having to look at the boundaries of services is more important and then maybe accept a small amount of duplication as long as it's not excessive.
[18:39:33] <JakeSays> jmer: but first i'd examine why you're splitting the mono service. is it "because it should be split" or is there a valid reason?
[18:39:56] <jmer> JakeSays: because it's a 25 year old mess and too many responsibilities has been crammed into one "part".
[18:40:27] <JakeSays> jmer: is that causing issues?
[18:40:28] <jmer> JakeSays: also right now the software architecture doesn't mirror the organizational structure so we're tripping over each others feet.
[18:40:45] <jmer> we splitting the mono into small services, but NOT microservices xD
[18:41:19] <jmer> JakeSays: I'm not splitting it just because microservices are the new fad :P
[18:41:20] <JakeSays> ah ok. makes sense then
[18:41:27] <JakeSays> good
[18:41:42] <jmer> microservices comes with a cost... That cost has to be justifiable.
[18:43:06] <jmer> I've seen it more than once that people start talking about microservices and start writing small services, but they forget the abstracitn layer that makes these services communicate in a well structured way that can be governed properly over a long period of time.
[18:43:10] <Guest87> I don't think you can even call them a new fad anymore.
[18:43:11] <Guest87> Just a fad.
[18:43:16] <jmer> Usually I've just seen smaller services call other services directly
[18:44:25] <JakeSays> well, a fad by definition is new since they never get old. they just disappear

[18:45:42] <lz_> oh would you look at that. chrome removed the "google search image" context menu once again. I had to reactivate it in some hidden flags, now I guess it's gone for good
[18:46:10] <MatthiasVance> I called a notary .. where they had an hour paid lunch apparently .. to call them again afterwards .. only to be told to call back tomorrow because then "the persons making the appointments are working in the morning"

[18:51:06] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: a notary is a notary. you can use them for anything (at least here)00000
[18:51:30] <MatthiasVance> Ah your bank has a notary, that didn't exist in my head xD
[18:52:00] <JakeSays> it's a credit union so they offer it as a free service for members
[18:52:07] <MatthiasVance> And apparently the moment I make an appointment the bank doesn't allow them to pull the files until after 10 working days
[18:52:18] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: Neat!
[18:52:20] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: wtf

[18:53:37] <JakeSays> which, for me, after two days i've forgot about the fucking ticket
[18:53:48] <Guest87> ... stop getting tickets?

[19:02:31] <Nasp> jmer:  also i would share DTOs
[19:03:11] <edcba> isn't there some autoflush property ?
[19:03:55] <irwiss> most writers don't flush by default, flushing is expensive and unless you're expecting power loss not strictly necessary
[19:05:43] <smallville7123_> how do i flush on new line the same way the Console does?
[19:06:05] <smallville7123_> as i tried StreamWriter but it does not flush either

[19:53:53] <smallville7123_> so i dont have to manually detect the new line string myself so i can flush when it occurs
[19:54:44] <JakeSays> right but why do you need flushing at all
[19:54:52] <smallville7123_> since on windows it is \r\n and on other plaforms it may be different
[19:55:11] <JakeSays> it is definitely different
[19:55:21] <smallville7123_> and '\n' alone may not be a valid new line on all platforms
[19:55:28] <JakeSays> it isn't
[19:55:44] <JakeSays> my point is, why do you care when flush happens
[19:56:14] <JakeSays> smallville7123_: well, actually, \n is new line on all platforms
[19:56:36] <smallville7123_> cus im writing a logging library that will hook into Console.Out to automatically indent all of its output
[19:56:49] <canton7> smallville7123_, why not set StreamWriter.AutoFlush.....
[19:57:06] <JakeSays> canton7: it doesn't work (but if it did, it wouldn't work properly)
[19:57:10] <smallville7123_> so even if Console.WriteLine is used it's output will still remain indented
[19:57:29] <JakeSays> smallville7123_: right i get it. just override WriteLine() and then fix the rest of your code
[19:58:00] <smallville7123_> Console is a static class
[19:58:14] <JakeSays> smallville7123_: no, in the textwriter that you created
[19:58:15] <smallville7123_> i cannot override its methods
[19:58:41] <JakeSays> huh?
[19:58:45] <JakeSays> er,
[19:58:47] <JakeSays> n/m
[19:59:18] <smallville7123_> where can i obtain the system's new line character
[20:00:02] <JakeSays> smallville7123_: Environment.NewLine
[20:00:13] <JakeSays> but you don't need that
[20:00:28] <canton7> Oh, Console.Out. But Console.Out is a TextWriter, which is already set to AutoFlush
[20:02:13] <smallville7123_> canton7: yes but it cannot indent it's output automatically
[20:02:35] <smallville7123_> like IndentedTextWriter can
[20:02:55] <JakeSays> smallville7123_: aren't you creating your own indented writer?
[20:03:31] <smallville7123_> JakeSays: how would i detect when a new line has occured, given a series of single characters
[20:03:35] <smallville7123_> JakeSays: yes
[20:04:22] <JakeSays> smallville7123_: WHEN YOUR OVERRIDDEN WriteLine() is called
[20:04:22] <smallville7123_> as i cannot rely on Append(string) since the user may simply do Append('\r'); Append('\n');
[20:06:16] <canton7> See here: https://dotnetfiddle.net/OkanHC
[20:06:33] <smallville7123_> is there a class that can match a string based on buffered input?
[20:06:46] <canton7> smallville7123_, but IndentedTextWriter doesn't do any buffering of its own
[20:06:59] <smallville7123_> i know
[20:07:04] <canton7> smallville7123_, the only thing that could be buffering is the TextWriter which Console.Out gives you, and that's set to AutoFlush
[20:07:12] <canton7> So that won't buffer either
[20:07:32] <smallville7123_> i meant like
[20:07:36] <canton7> So there, exactly, do you think that buffering is happening?
[20:07:39] <canton7> *So where
[20:08:07] <JakeSays> canton7: that always flushes, not just at line boundaries
[20:08:21] <smallville7123_> like using Write() to build a line instead of sending entire line in WriteLine
[20:08:28] <JakeSays> smallville7123_: your problem is you are WAY over thinking this
[20:10:07] *** Quits: alguien (~alguien@user/alguien) (Remote host closed the connection)
[20:10:20] <canton7> smallville7123_, every single call to .Write will flush
[20:11:19] <canton7> Sure if you embed a \n in a string it won't write the first part, flush, write the \n, flush, write the second part, flush -- it'll write the whole string and then flush. But is that really a problem? Console.Out is synchronized, so nothing else is going to interrupt your call to Write in the middle
[20:11:29] <smallville7123_> so System.IO.StreamWriter just sends everything to whatever stream it is given in the constructor ?
[20:11:59] <smallville7123_> and thus flush is not called on System.IO.StreamWriter itself, but instead on the stream passed to it?
[20:12:09] <JakeSays> smallville7123_: yes. that's the purpose of a StreamWriter
[20:12:12] <canton7> Looke here: https://referencesource.microsoft.com/#mscorlib/system/io/streamwriter.cs,421
[20:12:20] <smallville7123_> ok
[20:13:01] <JakeSays> smallville7123_: StreamWriter will call Flush with every write if AutoFlush is true
[20:13:04] <JakeSays> er, will flush
[20:13:05] <canton7> smallville7123_, so when you call 'Write(string)', it writes to an internal char array. If the char array fills up, then it calls Flush() to write it to the underlying stream, and then starts filling it up again. Once the method is done, if autoFlush is true, then it calls Flush a final time to empty anything left in the char buffer into the
[20:13:05] <canton7> underlying stream
[20:13:41] <JakeSays> smallville7123_: if you only want flushing on EOL then you need to implement that behavior yourself
[20:13:44] <canton7> So if AutoFlush is true, every single write will end with it writing any data that it buffered during the call to Write to the underlying stream

[20:18:40] <smallville7123_> yes but StringWriter has no method/variable to retrieve the given stream that was passed in the constructor
[20:19:04] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: Ah!

[20:19:30] <smallville7123_> System.IO.StreamWriter *
[20:19:41] <JakeSays> smallville7123_: dude read the docs. there is a property.
[20:20:16] <canton7> smallville7123_, or use the link I gave you to the referencesource to find the field that the constructor stores the stream in, and then click the field name to find all references, and find the reference that returns it

[20:24:02] <canton7> And yeah, a TextWriter might write to a Stream (i.e. a StreamWriter), or it might write directly to a String (i.e. a StringWriter).
[20:24:11] <canton7> Or it might be neither. The TextWriter base class doesn't care
[20:25:03] <canton7> So a StringWriter has a way to get the StringBuilder it's writing characters to; a StreamWriter has a way to get the inner Stream it's writing bytes to
[20:25:19] <canton7> and an IndentedTextWriter has a way to get the TextWriter it's writing to, whatever that may be

[22:35:03] <DevJohnC> MatthiasVance, correct
[22:35:10] <MatthiasVance> Ew!
[22:35:26] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: Well, yeah that's what I thought just checking to see if anything has changed in the past 2-3 years :P
[22:35:44] <DevJohnC> MatthiasVance, because afaik C# has no way to inform when a property must be initialized when using property initializer syntax
[22:36:25] <DevJohnC> MatthiasVance, my question would be: why use NRTs if you're going the check for null anyway?
[22:36:57] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: Can you answer that from your perspective perhaps? ^
[22:38:14] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: because a consumer can just disable support and pass null anywhere they want
[22:39:23] <MatthiasVance> I think in most of the cases (internal to a company) I'd want it enforced
[22:39:36] <MatthiasVance> Unless you are of course writing a library and people are dumb (to not use it)
[22:39:46] <MatthiasVance> *a library for external use
[22:40:27] <JakeSays> now if i could annotate a class with [OverrideAsshatUsersAndAlwaysEforceNRT] then i'd not use guards
[22:45:25] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: But you only write guards then for externally visible methods, right?
[22:48:04] <MichaelLong> I do that at least

[22:57:59] <GunArm> how can I make a method prototype that takes a tuple like (x, y) as an argument?  I've not found syntax on msdn.  I found that you can do Method(Tuple<x, y> tuple) {... } but you can't pass (x,y) into that as apparently (x, y) is different than Tuple<x, y>  (even forgetting ValueTuple)
[22:59:50] <GunArm> nvm, it's so obvious I didn't think of it
[22:59:52] <jonp> GunArm: have you tried `void Foo((int X, int Y) tuple)`?
[22:59:58] <GunArm> yes, thanks lol
[23:00:33] <GunArm> it didn't occur to me i could put an identifier after (x,y) to name the param, but of course you can since its a type

[23:27:24] <bomb> lara99 try Puppeteer
[23:27:32] <bomb> it's a headless Chrome. beheaded so it doesn't need a GUI

[23:28:53] <Guest87> hello bomb
[23:29:04] <JakeSays> bomb: doesn't puppeteer just control a chrome instance?
[23:29:06] <Guest87> how are you today
[23:29:12] <Guest87> JakeSays: yes
[23:29:19] <lara99> bomb: it seems very complex
[23:29:22] <bomb> JakeSays yeah, it's not "all-in" like PhantomJS
[23:29:39] <JakeSays> lara99: well, what you're trying to do isn't a trivial thing
[23:29:55] <lara99> I was thinking to something like take a screenshot from c#
[23:29:56] <bomb> lara99 Selenium with chromedriver would work
[23:30:25] <JakeSays> lara99: there are a lot of ways to do this
[23:30:25] <edcba> you can do screenshots but then there are a lot of gotchas that may happen
[23:30:26] <smallville7123_> is IDisposable gaurenteed to be called by the GC
[23:30:28] <bomb> lara99 it just takes running an external process with some arguments

[23:30:36] <ki9a> MatthiasVance: ever been to Saalbach?
[23:30:39] <JakeSays> smallville7123_: no. it's never called by the gc
[23:30:44] <smallville7123_> oh
[23:31:49] <lara99> bomb: the fact is that there are 1000+ images to be created, the HTM and CSS content content is drawn dynamically
[23:31:57] <smallville7123_> how can i make sure some code is called when my object gets GC'd
[23:32:07] <jonp> smallville7123_: finalizers
[23:32:10] <canton7> You can never make sure of that
[23:32:13] <jonp> but, do you really, *really*, need that?
[23:32:33] <JakeSays> smallville7123_: yeah you shouldn't depend on the GC for your cleanup
[23:32:39] <bomb> lara99 that's fine. get the webpage ready, and let Selenium open the webpage and take screenshot without GUI
[23:33:19] <edcba> what kinnd of css+html that is ?
[23:34:16] <lara99> edcba: they are infographics
[23:35:16] <lara99> bomb: with CÃ it is not possible?

[23:36:25] <Suchiman> 20:06:26 <â€¢DevJohnC> MatthiasVance, my question would be: why use NRTs if you're going the check for null anyway? <--- to tell you if you forgot to check for null
[23:36:38] <jonp> smallville7123_: `using (foo) {â€¦}` will call `foo.Dispose()` at the closing {
[23:36:41] <jonp> er, }
[23:37:07] <Suchiman> 20:18:56 <â€¢DevJohnC> I wonder if there's an analyzer for the prop init syntax issue <--- hmmmm that would actually be feasable to write i think... but they're working on fixing that in C# 11 anyway
[23:37:37] <canton7> Yeah, required properties are going to be a thing, and I can't wait
[23:37:37] <JakeSays> c# 11.. that's like forever away
[23:37:57] <Suchiman> JakeSays: 8 months

[23:38:05] <JakeSays> yeah forever!
[23:38:13] <JakeSays> FOREVER!
[23:38:16] <canton7> You can hop on the previews before that - eases the wait
[23:38:20] <Suchiman> JakeSays: true, at least 4 JS frameworks will have risen and fallen by then
[23:38:29] <JakeSays> nah i dont do .net previews
[23:38:39] <JakeSays> Suchiman: LOL true that
[23:39:34] <JakeSays> canton7: i don't get much from just trying language features, and if i can't use them in production then there's not much of a point
[23:40:06] <Suchiman> JakeSays: i mean you could use the preview SDK to get access to C# 11 but keep targeting .NET 6.0 :P
[23:40:18] <canton7> Depends how lax your production is :P Can you get away with preview language features on a stable .NET version? Can't remember whether the compiler forces you to target a preview .net version
[23:40:51] <Suchiman> canton7: you just need <LangVersion>preview</LangVersion> i think, then you can use it on net6.0
[23:41:14] <JakeSays> well, then i'd have to deal with all the IDE errors due to the ide not understanding the syntax, etc
[23:41:48] <canton7> You'll need to be on a preview VS, yeah. Preview compiler, stable runtime
[23:41:50] <smallville7123_> why is `Console.Write(base.ToString());` calling `StringWriter.write` even though it's `Console.Out` is  `{System.IO.TextWriter.SyncTextWriter}`
[23:42:14] <JakeSays> canton7: yeah and release vs's are buggy enough as it is
[23:42:41] <Suchiman> JakeSays: what you mean? they're just as stable as "stable" VS :P
[23:42:51] <canton7> Eh, that's not entirely true
[23:43:09] <JakeSays> also they don't run on linux:p
[23:43:12] <Suchiman> canton7: my stable VS frequently locks up when i do stuff with it x

[23:49:16] <_genuser_> jmer, I think it's cool if it's part of the learning process. But if you're going to hold it against him at review, then it might be worth mentioning that initials fails must be allowed.
[23:49:31] <_genuser_> consistent fails are ok to bring up in review.
[23:49:39] <_genuser_> what JakeSays said.
[23:49:39] <jmer> _genuser_: lol. no he's an intern he shouldn't be reviewed on anything except whether he learned something here :P
[23:50:02] <_genuser_> cool. let him have free reign in his own branch. compile/fail, etc.
[23:50:21] <jmer> he's working on feature branches and can't change master without a PR

[23:51:44] <_genuser_> man git is really stupid sometimes. "The most similar command is status". Well if there's only one match why don't you just ahead and assume that was the command?
[23:51:59] <jmer> _genuser_: just alias your typo? :P
[23:52:23] <_genuser_> jmer I think it's going to be a good experience for the intern.
[23:52:31] <_genuser_> jmer alias the git command?
[23:53:01] <_genuser_> it can be anything. git statu or git stats or git tatus, just depends. The laptop keyboard isn't tactile enough.

[23:55:06] <_genuser_> jmer nice! I remember mercurial if it found only one match to what you typed in, it would just assume that command.
[23:55:10] <bomb> I never heard of that software before
[23:55:37] <_genuser_> JakeSays of course, you'd rate yourself A+. You're a consultant. Let an honest review come in for a change.
[23:55:48] <_genuser_> this intern will probably rate JakeSays 0 on interpersonal skills.
[23:55:57] <jmer> _genuser_: I've never used anything but git... Subversion was the standard initially but back tghen I was in school so got no benefit from learning it.
