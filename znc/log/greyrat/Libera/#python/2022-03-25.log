My example is as follows: Python Variable = pvar_exodus_current_json_filename and my print state is "Payload [2/4] Finished for Current JSON File: {FILENAME}" ; what do I replace {FILENAME} with to output my Python Variable in that Print statement spot? Thanks in advance! :)

[02:15:41] <auctus> for n in range(10)
[02:15:46] <auctus> thats an easy way to write:

[05:59:39] <SnoopJ> jinsun, right, so the breakage is at the system level. Since these packages changed yesterday, it seems likely they broke something.
[06:00:11] <jinsun> but pycurious is running pip too, so not entirely using system packages
[06:00:34] <jinsun> if you want to use /usr/bin/python then you should not use pip

[06:00:58] <SnoopJ> jinsun, do you think it's a coincidence that another user submitted an identical report to pip today?
[06:01:19] <pycurious> jinsun: if you have experience with arch - you might be able to help.
[06:01:36] <SnoopJ> pycurious, have you tried using an older version of the python3 package? You should try doing that.
[06:01:59] <SnoopJ> err, sorry, they just call it python, not python3
[06:02:00] <pycurious> jinsun: I think my dockerfile might be doing something wonky. But this code was working perfectly till yesterday.
[06:02:51] <jinsun> well it could be due to system python, I am not ruling that out, just not using venv is the obvious mistake though, so I'd try that too
[06:03:17] <SnoopJ> jinsun, the venv will have the same pip, though?
[06:03:32] <jinsun> and no experience with the system python, I use pyenv

[06:04:57] <SnoopJ> pycurious, the issue is almost certainly the `python` package which was just updated. Really, you should /join #archlinux and ask them if there's a way to install an older version of that package.

[13:03:22] <switcher61> Hi there. I've some time ago written a small package that lets me work with EE values. It basically inherits floats and then overloads all the algebraic operators. The overloading stuff was a bit of copy paste, and I don't fully understand it. This is now a problem, as I want to tweak it a bit, and the stuff I want to tweak is for sure in there.

[16:07:38] <gloomy> second question: Say I also have a class `CollectionOfA` with attribute `contents: List[A]`, and I want a subclass `CollectionOfAplus`.  The main difference is that the new class instead has `contents: List[Aplus]`. A lot of methods are exactly the same, but have incorrect types - for instance say CollectionOfA has a `get_random_a(self) -> A` method, that method in the CollectionOfAplus should have the same exact behaviour but return a Aplus. How do
[16:07:38] <gloomy> I fix this?

[17:15:23] <Tritium> practically, they are for deduplication where order doesn't matter.  Originally, for a fast random access collection of values, that you can do mathematical set operations on.
[17:15:27] <xheimlich> they've probably thought this through. One typically does not access elements at random, but loop/iterate through them.
[17:16:13] <xheimlich> order doesn't matter for "best_trials" either since they're Pareto optimal trials for multi-objective problems and have no natural single order.
[17:16:16] <grym> xheimlich: well, they're real nice for math...
[17:16:45] <grym> xheimlich: but a common use is "i have a set of naughty values; prune this other collection s.t. those values are removed" in "normal" code
[17:16:54] <Tritium> I mostly find myself reaching for them to make sense of garbage data (aside from deduplication)
[17:16:59] <grym> in which case `x in someset` is O(1) not O(n)
[17:17:21] <xheimlich> I assume lists are really really great in real-world scenarios with 30 < N < 1000  elements.
[17:17:41] <xheimlich> grym: I did read on the complexity classes of operations.
[17:17:58] <grym> if you're filtering, sets go brrrrrrr
[17:18:00] <xheimlich> but in practice -- I never see libraries using sets.

[19:40:06] <SnoopJ> (the relevant sections of the HTML spec seem to be 13.1.4 and 13.5)

[20:07:34] <ghost43> Hi. I am trying to debug a reprodubility failure where when I pip install a package on Windows the exe files that get created in the "Scripts/" folder differ (where entry_points/console_scripts get put). I would like to look at the code that creates those exe files, but I am not sure what is doing that exactly. Is it pip or setuptools or distutils or something else?

[20:08:35] <ChrisWarrick> ps_: my guess would be that `---` == <hr> in markdown, so they’re escaping it
[20:08:38] <Tritium> ghost43: for the most part, you download the .whl file from pypi, change it to .zip and look inside to see the files.  unless you are building from source

[22:45:32] <bjs> zoooz: well someone 1-on-1 teaching you would be best, but almost nobody gets that. A class/school would be second best. Books/videos/websites cannot teach you on their own, in the same way that a lecture cannot teach you something

[23:27:00] <BrokenCog> Integer would seem more compact.  Panda's might be defaulting to BIGINT as a way of open ended growth.
[23:27:03] <BrokenCog> the lines were:

[23:28:48] <Imk0tter> is there a best way to add a tuple of numbers ie: (1, 25) to a tuple of tuples ie ((12, 15), (32,42)) += (i, 25) == ((13,40), (33,82))
[23:29:22] <BrokenCog> ChrisWarrick: considering it's all Big Data ... I guess it seems reasonable to presume large values.
[23:29:30] <SnoopJ> Imk0tter, the answer hasn't really changed since yesterday. If you're doing this with lots of numerical data, I cannot recommend numpy enough.

[23:51:03] <mmdbalkhi> Hi, I have seen in some places that some functions or other things are defined in this way. What is this and why should we use it?
[23:51:03] <mmdbalkhi> https://bpa.st/BLBA
[23:51:12] <SnoopJ> I don't think it's a big problem, though, just a curious edge case
[23:51:27] <Tritium> mmdbalkhi: ... is an object, that evaluates to nothing
[23:51:34] <ChrisWarrick> mmdbalkhi: ... is the Ellipsis literal, it doesn’t do anything useful
[23:51:36] <Tritium> mmdbalkhi: its just another spelling of pass
[23:51:50] <Tritium> i mean, in this context it is
[23:51:56] <ChrisWarrick> mmdbalkhi: this is probably used to define a function without giving it a meaningful body
[23:51:58] <Tritium> it has uses in ....numpy i think?
[23:52:07] <mmdbalkhi> Tritium: so why use it?
[23:52:08] <SnoopJ> Tritium, yes, numpy uses it to mean "all the rest of the axes"
[23:52:40] <Tritium> mmdbalkhi: its quicker to type than pass, the only reason to do it in function bodies that you are stubbing out
[23:52:40] <bjs> mmdbalkhi: you can put any value there, you could write `def test(): 17`
[23:52:46] <SnoopJ> mmdbalkhi, it's just a handy way to spell a function that doesn't really have a body
[23:52:57] <bjs> mmdbalkhi: `...` is just a boring value that people sometimes like to type because it's short
[23:53:02] <SnoopJ> as bjs says, any value there would have the same effect
[23:53:19] <Tritium> I think with the exception of a string?
[23:53:30] <bjs> strings would become docstrings
[23:53:36] <SnoopJ> yea with a string it'll be a docstring
[23:53:46] <Tritium> would python keep looking for a body after the docstring?
[23:53:51] <SnoopJ> nah
[23:54:00] <Tritium> oh, so yeah, you could use a docstring too
[23:54:06] <SnoopJ> (the docstring is *part* of the body, lexically speaking)
[23:54:09] <Tritium> and probably should if stubbing out a function
