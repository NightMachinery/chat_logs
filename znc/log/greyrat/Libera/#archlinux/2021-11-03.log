[07:05:32] <jaawerth> without context I assume vqueiroz meant pacman, which does have the `--needed` flag but I'm pretty sure there isn't a corresponding pacman.conf option, since it's called out as a per-invocation override, so an alias or shell script wrapping pacman would be the most likely way
[07:07:10] <Dan39> that would be a nice option
[07:07:47] <Dan39> --needed only applies to -S and -U, so if you alias pacman and use a different option, will it complain?

[07:26:23] <jaawerth> vd: if it only works in FF I would check the DNS over HTTPS setting (just search dns from preferences), since FF could be enabling it by default (which I think they do in some locales), in which case my guess is it's a local DNS config issue that ff is just bypassing

[07:48:30] <jaawerth> not necessarily, I sometimes manually configure my DNS if I don't necessarily trust or want the one I'd get from DHCP. if automatic doesn't work it could be a DHCP issue. depending on what else you're running, the note here may also be relevant (might want to check the list of software using resolveconf it links to) https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Systemd-resolved#Automatically

[07:57:21] <jaawerth> well, if you want DHCP to work properly for automatic DNS server resolution, and you're using a network manager or vpn or something that uses resolvconf, I would probably still install it, since working things are cleaner than broken ones. if you don't want or need DNS via DHCP then you're probably fine
[07:58:34] <vd> you mean dhcp server or as a client/

[15:09:56] <earnestly> The best option I've seen is basically chucking them on a bunch of usb thumbdrives
[15:09:56] <jelle> earnestly: I can't tell if this is good advice, but I keep my gpg key + borg keys on a usb dongle (luks encrypted) one on keyring other at home. It does require manual syncing which is cumbersome
[15:09:58] <jkc> For that, I use an HSM, and I store the backup somewhere with very high data endurance. The backup is enrypted with a 26-word passphrase, randomly generated, which I have written on paper, copied, laminated, and stored in two safe deposit boxes. One near me, and one across the country with my busiess partner.
[15:10:00] <grawity> borg doesn't need key files, current versions support repokey mode where you just need a password
[15:10:09] <grawity> I don't use borg's encryption at all since the destination is on LUKS anyway
[15:10:40] <jkc> grawity: I haven't done a thorough analysis, but I am given to understand that borg's encryption isn't that great, so your approach may in fact be better.
[15:10:43] <grawity> (one backup of LUKS passphrase is in an actual paper notebook)
[15:10:49] <earnestly> I don't either but more just because it didn't have repokey at the time and it's too bothersome (my 'attack model' doesn't have the need)
[15:11:02] <grawity> jkc: from what I've heard, it was "not that great" if you were backing up multiple machines into a single repository
[15:11:02] <MacGyver> grawity: Iirc borg repokey still uses a key that you should back up.
[15:11:05] <grawity> jkc: but why would you do that
[15:11:14] <grawity> MacGyver: not sure of the correct name
[15:11:25] <jkc> grawity: That would be idiotic, yes. Thank you for the clarification!
[15:11:28] <grawity> MacGyver: but it uses a key that's stored as part of the repo config, within the repo
[15:11:36] <grawity> MacGyver: as opposed to storing it in ~/.borg where it can be forgotten
[15:11:42] <MacGyver> Yeah. But you should still take a backup of it.
[15:11:45] <earnestly> Yeah, I'd necessarily mean "last chance" backup which is fine and you can go to extremes, I just used it as an example for something inconvenient.  That's something I can still do but the emphasis was more on "usable" storage
[15:11:48] <grawity> jkc: it's not entirely "idiotic", e.g. restic has it as an explicit feature

[15:12:26] <jkc> grawity: I am again given to understand that restic has similar issues in a similar scenario.
[15:12:46] <earnestly> jkc: HSMs look nice although I don't know how general they are; storing certs to text files and all the key types inbetween.  Then there's the problem of most HSMs being closed firmware
[15:13:11] <jelle> earnestly: is the nitrokey not open source?
[15:13:12] <grawity> HSMs mostly deal with asymmetric keys (RSA or ECDSA) and the occassional AES or HMAC key

[15:13:36] <earnestly> Yeah, I figured HSMs were a bit more particular in what they store

[17:27:04] <susi> it's suboptimal to have to re-enable touchpad manually after resuming, rmmod & modprobe

[17:27:26] <MacGyver> susi: Sec.
[17:27:28] <grawity> for device drivers – if you need to reload a module to work around a bug, systemd's "sleep hooks" are a good place
[17:27:58] <grawity> `man systemd-sleep` describes where to put them, it's a basic shellscript
[17:28:11] <MacGyver> I've got a "reinsert-kmod-at-sleep@.service"

[17:30:17] <MacGyver> I think the PartOf takes care of that.
[17:31:10] <MacGyver> Because when systemd stops sleep.target (which iirc it does when resuming) the PartOf should propagate that here.

[17:32:30] <grawity> hmm it doesn't do so explicitly, but
[17:32:34] <MacGyver> It may indicate faulty hardware, as it did on my old T440s.
[17:32:56] <MacGyver> (But on my new T14s it's almost certainly just the driver having to resync after resume)
[17:33:13] <MacGyver> grawity: I'm pretty confident this works, tbh. Just not entirely certain.
[17:33:49] <grawity> you resume, the kernel returns from the write() call to /sys/power/state, this allows systemd-suspend.service to exit, and sleep.target stops due to having StopWhenUnneeded=

[23:44:21] <feinedsquirrel> and up at the top, where it defines vdpau, it says "library and api to offload ... to the GPU video hardware, developed by nvidia" does that mean it will prefer a dedicated card? Is there a way to know what selection it would make if I have the translation layer driver and "regular" driver installed?
[23:44:30] *** Quits: Pickchea (~private@user/pickchea) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:44:51] <grawity> run vainfo and see what driver it chooses
[23:45:06] <grawity> LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME can be set to override its choice
[23:46:01] <feinedsquirrel> ie. if I have both nvidia-utils, and libvdpau-va-gl... ok, so I have attempted both, but vainfo returns the same thing both times, if I remember from my testing last night. I'll try again really quick
[23:46:31] <grawity> libvdpau-va-gl is the opposite
[23:46:44] <grawity> if you want VA-API apps to use nvidia, libva-vdpau-driver is the one you want

[23:50:31] <feinedsquirrel> does LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME have to be declared at boot? when I try in the terminal, running vainfo, it reports it is using iHD. If I immediately set LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME=vdpau and run vainfo in the same terminal, I still get iHD is being used.
[23:50:37] <grawity> so if you want the nvidia to be used, I think LiBVA_DRIVER_NAME=vdpau VDPAU_DRIVER=nvidia would really force it that way

[23:58:50] <feinedsquirrel> :grawity alright, I'm back. will test the same again, one sec
[23:58:51] <grawity> iirc, VDPAU inherently relies on X11 (whereas VA-API does not), so if you're on wayland, vdpau probably won't work neither directly nor in any ither way
[23:58:58] <grawity> dunno if that has changed recently
