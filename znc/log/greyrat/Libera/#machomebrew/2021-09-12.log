[22:22:55] <bxsx> hi, is it possible to disable running `upgrade` after `install` command? all my packages were upgraded after installing a new package
[22:31:08] <bxsx> uhm, looks like not all packages were upgraded but dependents, anyway pretty weird, maybe due to openssl upgrade
[22:31:25] <bxsx> so, this leaded to finding a bug
[22:33:02] <bxsx> `brew install package` installed the package and all dependencies, then it started to upgrade even more packages. the problem was python@3.9, first it upgraded from 3.9.5 to 3.9.7, then python@3.9 was reinstalled 3 times more for other updaded packages
[22:33:23] <bxsx> at the end, brew wanted to upgrade 3.9.7 to 3.9.7 and here it failed with the: Error: Directory not empty @ dir_s_rmdir - /usr/local/Cellar/python@3.9/3.9.5
[22:33:50] <bxsx> also `brew cleanup` fails to remove 3.9.5...
[22:44:20] <bxsx> ok, seems like this: https://github.com/Homebrew/discussions/discussions/633
